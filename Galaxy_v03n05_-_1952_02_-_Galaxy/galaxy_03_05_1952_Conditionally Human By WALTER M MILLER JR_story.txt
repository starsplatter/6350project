Conditionally Human By WALTER M. MILLER, JR. 



THERE was no use hanging 
around after breakfast. His 
wife was in a hurt mood, 
end he could neither endure the 
hurt nor remove it. He put on 
his coat in the kitchen and stood 
for a moment with his hat in hia 
hands. His wife was still at the 
table, absently fingering the handle of her cup and staring fixedly 
out the window at the kennels 
behind the house. He moved 






quietly up behind her and 
touched her silk-clad shoulder. 
The shoulder shivered away from 
him, and her dark hair swung 
shiningly as she shuddered. He 
drew his hand back and his bewildered face went slack and 
miserable. 



"Honeymoon's over, huh?" 
She said nothing, but shrugged 
faintly. 

"You knew I worked for the 
F.B.A.," he said. "You knew I'd 
have charge of a district pound. 
You knew it before we got married." 




"I didn't know you killed 
them," she said venomously 

"I won't have to kill many. 
Besides, they're only animals." 

''Intelligent animals!" 

"Intelligent as a human imbecile, maybe." 

"A small child is an imbecile. 
Would you kill a small child?" 

"You're taking intelligence as 
the only criterion of humanity," 
he protested hopelessly, knowing 
that a logical defense was useless 
against sentimentality. "Baby — " 

"Don't call rrie baby! Call them 
baby!" 

Norris backed a few steps toward the door. Against his better 
judgment, he spoke again. "Anne 
honey, look! Think of the good 
things about the job. Sure, everything has its ugly angles. But 
think — we get this house rent= 
free; I've got my own district 
with no bosses around; I make 
my own hours; you'll meet lots of 
people that stop in at the pound. 
Ifs a fine job, honey!" 

She sipped her coffee and appeared to be listening, so he went 
on. 

"And what can I do? You know 
how the Federation handles employment. They looked over my 
aptitude tests and sent me to 
Bio -Administration. If I don't 
want to follow my aptitudes, the 
only choice is common labor. 
That's the law." 

"I suppose you have an apti


tude for killing babies?" she said 
sweetly. 

Norris withered. His voice went 
desperate. "They assigned me to 
it because I liked babies. And because I have a B.S. in biology 
and an aptitude for dealing with 
people. Can't you understand? 
Destroying unclaimed units is the 
smallest part of it. Honey, before 
the evolvotron, before Anthropos 
went into the mutant-animal business, people used to elect dogcatchers. Think of it that way— 
I'm just a dogcatcher." 

Her cool green eyes turned 
slowly to meet his gaze. Her face 
was delicately cut from cold marble. She was a small woman, 
slender and fragile, but her quiet 
contempt made her loom. 

He backed closer to the door. 

"Well, I've got to get on the 
job." He put on his hat and 
picked at a splinter on the door. 
He frowned studiously at the 
splinter. "I — I'll see you tonight." 
He ripped the splinter loose when 
it became obvious that she didn't 
want to be kissed. 

He grunted a nervous good-by 
and stumbled down the hall and 
out of the house. The honeymoon 
was over, all right. 

He climbed in the kennel-truck 
and drove east toward the highway. The suburban street wound 
among the pastel plasticoid cottages that were set appro* mately 
two to an acre on the lightly 



32 




 



wooded land. With its population 
legally fixed at three hundred 
million, most of the country had 
become one big suburb, dotted 
with community centers and 
lined with narrow belts of industrial development. Norris wished 
there were someplace where he 
could be completely alone. 

As he approached an intersection, he saw a small animal sitting on the curb, wrapped in its 
own bushy tail. Its oversized 
head was bald on top, but the 
rest of its body was covered with 
blue-gray fur. Its tiny pink 
tongue was licking daintily at 
small forepaws with prehensile 
thumbs. It was a cat-Q-5. It 
glanced curiously at the truck as 
Norris pulled to a halt. 

He smiled at it from the window and called, "What's your 
name, kitten?" 

The cat-Q-5 stared at him impassively for a moment, let out a 
stuttering high-pitched wail, 
then: "Kiyi Rorry." 

"Whose child are you, Rorry?" 
he asked. "Where do you live?" 

The cat-Q-5 took its time 
about answering. There were no 
houses near the intersection, and 
Norris feared that the animal 
might be lost. It blinked at him, 
sleepily bored, and resumed its 
paw-washing. He repeated the 
questions. * 

"Mama kiyi," said the cat-Q-S 
disgustedly. 



"Thafs right, Mama's kitty. 

But where is Mama? Do you suppose she ran away?" 

The cat-Q-5 looked startled. It 
stuttered for a moment, and its 
fur crept slowly erect. It glanced 
around hurriedly, then shot off 
down the street at a fast scamper. 
He followed it in the truck until 
it darted onto a porch and began 
wailing through the screen, 
"Mama no run ray! Mama no 
run ray I" 

Norris grinned and drove on. 
A class-C couple, allowed no children of their own, could get quite 
attached to a cat-Q-5. The felines 
were emotionally safer than 
the quasi-human chimp-K series 
called "neutroids." When a pet 
neutroid died, a family was 
broken with flpief; but most 
couples could endure the death 
of a cat-Q or a dog-F. Class-C 
couples were allowed two lesser 
units or one neutroid. 

His grin faded as he wondered 
which Anne would choose. The 
Norrises were class-C — defective 
heredity. 

HE found himself in Sherman 
III Community Center — 
eight blocks of commercial buildings, serving the surrounding suburbs. He stopped at the message 
office to pick up his mail. There 
was a memo from Chief Franklin. He tore it open nervously and 
read it in the truck. It was some


CONDIMONALLY HUMAN 



39 



thing he had been expecting for 
several days. 

Attention All District Inspectors: 
Subject: Deviant Neutroid. 

You will immediately begin a systematic and thorough survey of all 
animals whose serial numbers fall in 
the Bermuda-k-9° series for birth 
dates during July 2234. This is in connection with the Delmont Negligency 
Case. Seize all animals in this category, impound, and run proper sections of normalcy tests. Watch for 
mental and glandular deviation. Delmont has confessed to passing only one 
non-standard unit, but there may be 
others. He disclaims memory of deviant's serial number. This could be * 
ruse to bring a stop to investigations 
when one animal i% found. Be thorough. 

If allowed to reach age-set or adulthood, such a deviant could be dangerous to its owner or to others. Hold 
all seized K-9°s who show the slightest 
abnormality in the normalcy testa. 
Forward to central lab. Return standard units to their owners. Accomplish 
entire survey project within seven 
days. 

C. Franklin 

Norris frowned at the last sentence. His district covered about 
two hundred square miles. Its replacement-quota of new neutroids was around three hundred 
animals a month. He tried to estimate how many of July's influx 
had been K-99s from Bermuda 
Factory. Forty, at least. Could 
he do it in a week? And there 
were only eleven empty neutroid 
cages in his kennel. The other 
forty-nine were occupied by the 
previous inspector's "unclaimed" 
inventory — awaiting destruction. 

14 < 



He wadded the memo in his 
pocket, then nosed the truck onto 
the highway and headed toward 
Wylo City and the district wholesale offices of Anthropos, Inc. 
I They should be able to give him 
; a list of all July's Bermuda K-99 
serial numbers that had entered 
his territory, together with the 
retailers to whom the animals had 
been sold. A week's deadline for 
finding and testing forty neutroids would put him in a tight 
squeeze. 

1 He was halfway to Wylo City 
! when the radiophone burzed on 
his dashboard. He pulled into the 
slow lane and answered quickly, 
I hoping for Anne's voice. A polite 
professional purr came instead. 
"Inspector Norris? This is Doci tor Georges. We haven't met, but 
1 I imagine we will. Are you ex, tremely busy at the moment?" 
Norris hesitated. "Extremely," 
he said. 

"Well, this won't take long. 
One of my patients — a Mrs. 
Sarah Glubbes — called a while 
I ago and said her baby was sick. 
I must be getting absent-minded, 
because I forgot she was class C 
until I got there." He hesitated. 
"The baby turned out to be a 
neutroid. It's dying. Eighteenth 
order virus." 
"So?" 

"Well, she's — uh— rather a peculiar woman, Inspector. Keeps 
telling me how much trouble she 


 



had in childbirth, and how she 
can't ever have another one. It's 
pathetic. She believes it's her own, 
Do you understand?" 

"I think so," Norris replied 
slowly. "But what do you want 
me to do? Can't you send the 
neutroid to a vet?" 

"She insists it's going to a hospital. Worst part is that she's 
heard of the disease. Knows it 
can be cured with the proper 
treatment — in humans. Of course, 
no hospital would play along 
with her fantasy and take a neutroid, especially since she couldn't 
pay for its treatment." 

"I still don't see — " 

"I thought perhaps you could 
help me fake a substitution. It's 
a K-48 series, five-year-old, 
three-year set. Do you have one 
in the pound that's not claimed?" 

Norris thought for a moment. 
**I think I have one. You're welcome to it, Doctor, but you can't 
fake a serial number. She'll know 
it And even though they look 
exactly alike, the new one won't 
recognize her. It'll be spooky." 

There was a long pause, followed by a sigh. "I'll try it anyway. Can I come get the animal 
now?" 

"I'm on the highway — " 
"Please, Norris! This is urgent. 

That woman will lose her mind 

completely if — " 

"All right, I'll call my wife 

and tell her to open the pound for 

CONDITIONALLY HUMAN 



you. Pick out the K-48 and sign 

for it. And listen — " 
"Yes?" 

"Don't let me catch you falsifying a serial number." 

Doctor Georges laughed faintly. "I won't, Norris. Thanks a 
million." He hung up quickly. 

Norris immediately regretted 
his consent It bordered on being 
illegal. But he saw it as a quick 
way to get rid of an animal that 
might later have to be killed. 

He called Anne. Her voice was 
dull. She seemed depressed, but 
not angry. When he finished talking, she said, "All right, Terry," 
and hung up. 

TtY noon, he had finished checking the shipping lists at the 
wholesale house in Wylo City. 
Only thirty-five of July's Bermuda-K-99s had entered his territory, and they were about 
equally divided among five pet 
shops, three of which were in 
Wylo City. 

After lunch, he called each of 
the retail dealers, read them the 
serial numbers, and asked them 
to check the sales records for 
names and addresses of individual buyers. By three o'clock, he 
had the entire list filled out, and 
the task began to look easier. All , 
that remained was to pick up the 
thirty-five animals. 

And that, he thought, was like 
trying to take a year-old baby 



away from its doting mother. He 
sighed and drove to the Wylo 
suburbs to begin his rounds. 

Anne met him at the door when 
he came home at six. He stood on 
the porch for a moment, smiling 
at her weakly. The smile was not 
returned. 

"Doctor Georges came." she 
told him. "He signed for the — " 
She stopped to stare at him. 
"Darling, your face! What happened?" 

Gingerly he touch the livid 
welts down the side of his cheek. 
"Just scratched a little," he muttered. He pushed past her and 
went to the phone in the hall. 
He sat eying it distastefully for 
a moment, not liking what he had 
to do. Anne came to stand beside 
him and examine the scratches. 

Finally he lifted the phone and 
dialed the Wylo exchange. A 
grating mechanical voice answered, "Locator center. Your 
party, please." 

"Sheriff Yates," Norris grunted. 

The robot operator, which had 
on tape the working habits of 
each Wylo City citizen, began 
calling numbers. It found the offduty sheriff on its third try, in 
a Wylo pool hall. 

"I'm getting so I hate that infernal gadget," Yates grumbled. 
"I think it's got me psyched. 
What do you want, Norris?" 

"Cooperation. I'm mailing you 
three letters charging three Wylo 



citizens with resisting a Federal 
official — namely me — and charging one of them with assault. I 
tried to pick up their neutroids 
for a pound inspection — " 

Yates bellowed lusty laughter 
into the phone. 

"It's not funny. I've got to get 
those neutroids. It's in connection 
with the Delmont case." 

Yates stopped laughing. "Oh. 
Well, I'll take care of it." 

"It's a-rush-order, Sheriff. Can 
you get the warrants tonight and 
pick up the animals in the morning?" 

"Easy on those warrants, boy. 
Judge Charleman can't be disturbed just any time. I can get 
the newts to you by noon, I guess, 
provided we don't have to get a 
helicopter posse to chase down 
the mothers." 

"That'll be all right. And listen, 
Yates — fix it so the charges will 
be dropped if they cooperate. 
Don't shake those warrants 
around unless they just won't 
listen to reason. But get those 
neutroids." 

"Okay, boy. Gotcha." 

Norris gave him the names and 
addresses of the three unwilling 
mothers. As soon as he hung up, 
Anne touched his shoulders and 
said, "Sit still." She began 
smoothing a chilly ointment over 
his burning cheek. 

"Hard day?" she asked. 

"Not too hard. Those were just 



3*

three out of fifteen. I got the other 
twelve. They're in the truck." 

"That's good," she said. 
''You've got only twelve empty 
cages." 

He neglected to tell her that 
he had stopped at twelve for just 
this reason. "Guess I better get 
them unloaded," he said, standing up. 

"Can I help you?" 

He stared at her for a moment, 
saying nothing. She smiled a little and looked aside. "Terry, I'm 
sorry — about this morning. I — I 
know you've got a job that has 
to be — " Her lip quivered slightly. 

Norris grinned, caught her 
shoulders, and pulled her close. 

"Honeymoon's on again, huh?" 
she whispered against his neck. 

"Come on," he grunted. "Let's 
unload some neutroids, before I 
forget all about work." 

7X1 HEY went out to the kennels 
together. The cages were inside a sprawling concrete barn, 
which was divided into three 
large rooms — one for the fragile 
neuter humanoid creatures, and 
another for the lesser mutants, 
such as cat-Qs, dog-Fs, dwarf 
bears, and foot-high lambs that 
never matured into sheep. The 
third room contained a small gas 
chamber with a conveyor belt 
leading from it to a crematoryincinerator. 

Norris kept the third locked 



lest his wife see its furnishings. 

The doll-like neutroids began 
their mindless chatter as soon as 
their keepers entered the building. Dozens of blazing blond 
heads began dancing about their 
cages. Their bodies thwacked 
against the wire mesh as they 
leaped about their compartments 
with monkey grace. 

Their human appearance was 
broken by only two distinct features: short beaverlike tails decorated with fluffy curls of fur, 
and an erect thatch of scalp-hair 
that grew up into a bright candleflame. Otherwise, they appeared completely human, with 
baby-pink skin, quick little 
smiles, and cherubic faces. They 
were sexually neuter and never 
grew beyond a predetermined 
age-set which varied for each 
series. Age-sets were available 
from one to ten years human 
equivalent. Once a neutroid 
reached its age-set, it remained 
at the set's child-development 
level until death. 

"They must be getting to know 
you pretty well," Anne said, 
glancing around at the cages. 

Norris was wearing a slight 
frown as he inspected the room. 
"They've never gotten this excited before." 

He walked along a row of 
cages, then stopped by a K-76 to 
stare. 

"Apple cores!" He turned to 



CONDITIONALLY HUMAN 



37 



face his wife. "How did apples 
get in there?" 

She reddened. "I felt sorry for 
them, eating that goo from the 
mechanical feeder. I drove down 
to Sherman III and bought six 
dozen cooking apples." 

"That was a mistake." 

She frowned irritably. "We can 
afford it." 

"That's not the point. There's 
a reason for the mechanical feeders. He paused, wondering how he 
could tell her the truth. He blundered on: "They get to love whoever feeds them." 

"I can't see — " 

"How would you feel about 
disposing of something that loved 
you?" 

Anne folded her arms and 
stared at him. "Planning to dispose of any soon?" she asked 
acidly. 

"Honeymoon's off again, eh?" 

She turned away. "I'm sorry, 
Terry. I'll try not to mention it 
again." 

He began unloading the truck, 
pulling the frightened and 
squirming doll-things forth one 
at a time with a snare-pole. They 
were one-man pets, always 
frightened of strangers. 

"What's the Delmont case, 
Terry ?" Anne asked while he 
worked. 

"Huh?" 

"I heard you mention it on the 
phone. Anything to do with why 



you got your face scratched?" 

He nodded sourly. "Indirectly* 
yes. It's a long story." 

"Tell me." 

"Well, Delmont was a greenhorn evolvotron operator at the 
Bermuda plant. His job was taking the unfertilized chimpanzee 
ova out of the egg-multiplier, 
mounting them in his machine, 
and bombarding the gene structure with sub-atomic particles. 
It's tricky business. He flashes 
a huge enlargement of the ovum 
on the electron microscope screen 
— large enough so he can see the 
individual protein molecules. He 
has an artificial gene pattern to 
compare it with. It's like shooting sub-atomic billiards. He's got 
to fire alpha- particles into the 
gene structure and displace certain links by just the right 
amount. And he's got to be quick 
about it before the ovum dies 
from an overdose of radiation 
from the enlarger. A good operator can get one success out of 
seven tries. 

"Well, Delmont worked a week 
and spoiled over a hundred ova 
without a single success. They 
threatened to fire him. I guess he 
got hysterical. Anyway, he reported one success the next day. 
It was faked. The ovum had a 
couple of flaws — something 
wrong in the central nervous system's determinants, and in the 
glandular makeup. Not a stand



 



ard neutroid ovum. He passed it 
on to the incubators to get a 
credit, knowing it wouldn't be 
caught until after birth." 

"It wasn't caught at all?" Anne 
asked. 

"Funny thing, he was afraid it 
wouldn't be. He got to worrying 
about it, thought maybe a mental-deviant would pass, and that 
it might be dangerous. So he went 
back to its incubator and cut off 
the hormone flow into its compartment." 

"Why that?" 

"So it would develop sexuality. 
A neutroid would be born a female if they didn't give it suppressive doses of male hormone 
prenatally. That keeps ovaries 
from developing and it comes out 
neuter. But Delmont figured a 
female would be caught and 
stopped before the final inspection. They'd dispose of her without even bothering to examine for 
the other defects. And he could 
blame the sexuality on an equipment malfunction. He thought it 
was pretty smart. Trouble was 
they didn't catch the female. She 
went on through; they all look 
female." 

"How did they find out about 
it now?" 

"He got caught last month, trying it again. And he confessed to 
doing it once before. No telling 
how many times he really did it." 

Norris held up the final kick


ing, squealing, tassel-haired doll 
from the back of the kennel truck. 
He grinned at his wife. "This little fellow, for instance. It might 
be a potential she. It might also 
be a potential murderer. All these 
kiddos are from the machines in 
the secti on where De 1 m out 
worked." 

Anne snorted and caught the 
baby -creature in her arms. It 
struggled and tried to bite, but 
subsided a little when she disentangled it from the snare, 
"Kkr-r-reee." it cooed nervously. 
"Kkr-r-reee!" 

"You tell him you're no murderer," Anne purred to it. 

Norris watched disapprovingly 
while she fondled it. One thing 
he had learned: to steer clear of 
emotional attachments. It was 
eight months old and looked like 
a child of two years — a year short 
of its age-set. And it was designed 
to be as affectionate as a human 
child. 

"Put it in the cage, Anne," he 
said quietly. 

She looked up and shook her 
head. 

"It belongs to somebody else. 
If it fixes a libido attachment on 
you, you're actually robbing its 
owner. They can't love many 
people at once." 

She snorted, but installed the 
thing in its cage. 

"Anne — -" Norris hesitated, 
hating to approach the subject. 



CONDITIONALLY HUMAN 



"Do you — want one — for yourself? I can sign an unclaimed one 
over to you to keep in the house. 
It won't cost us anything." 

Slowly she shook her head, and 
her pale eyes went moody and 
luminous. "I'm going to have one 
of ray own," she said. 

He stood in the back of the 
truck, staring down at her. "Do 
you realize what — " 

"I know what I'm saying. 
We're class-C oh account of 
heart -trouble in both our families. Well, I don't care, Terry. I'm 
not going to waste a heart over 
one of these pathetic little artificial animals. We're going to 
have a baby." 

"You know what they'd do to 
us?" 

"If they catch us, yes — compulsory divorce, sterilization. But 
they won't catch us. I'll have it 
at home, Terry. Not even a doctor. We'll hide it." 

"I won't let you do such a 
thing." 

She faced him angrily. "Oh, 
this whole rotten world!" she 
choked. Suddenly she turned and 
fled out of the building. She was 
sobbing. 

N ORRIS climbed slowly down 
from the truck and wandered 
on into the house. She was not 
in the kitchen nor the living room. 
The bedroom door was locked. 
He shrugged and went to sit on 



the sofa. The television set was 
on, and a newscast was coming 
from a local station. 

". . . we were unable to get 
shots of the body," the announcer 
was saying. "But here is a view 
of the Georges residence. I'll 
switch you to our mobile unit in 
Sherman II, James Duncan reporting." 

Norris frowned with bewilderment as the scene shifted to a 
two-story plasticoid house among 
the elm trees. It was after dark, 
but the mobile unit's powerful 
floodlights made daylight of the 
house and its yard and the police 
*copters sitting in a side lot. An 
ambulance was parked in the 
street. A new voice came on the 
audio. 

"This is James Duncan, ladies 
and gentlemen, speaking to you 
from our mobile unit in front of 
the late Doctor Hiram Georges' 
residence just west of Sherman 
II. We are waiting for the 
stretcher to be brought out. and 
Police Chief Erskine Miler is 
standing here beside me to give 
us a word about the case. Doctor 
Georges* death has shocked the 
community deeply. Most of you 
local listeners have known him 
for many years — some of you 
have depended upon his services 
as a family physician. He was a 
man well known, well loved. But 
now let's listen to Chief Miler." 

Norris sat breathing quickly. 



40 




 



There could scarcely he two Doctor Georges in the community, 
but only this morning . . . 

A growling drawl came from 
the audio. "This's Chief Miler 
speaking, folks. I just want to 
say that if any of you know the 
whereabouts of a Mrs. Sarah 
Glubbes, call me immediately. 
She's wanted for questioning." 

"Thank you. Chief. This is 
James Duncan again. I'll review 
the facts for you briefly again, 
ladies and gentlemen. At seven 
o'clock, less than an hour ago, a 
woman — allegedly Mrs. Glubbes 
— burst into Doctor Georges' dining room while the family was at 
dinner. She was brandishing a 
pistol and screaming, 'You stole 
my baby! You gave me the wrong 
baby! Where's my baby?' 

"When the doctor assured her 
that there was no other baby, she 
fired, shattering his salad plate. 
Glancing off it, the bullet pierced 
his heart. The woman fled. A peculiar feature of the case is that 
Mrs. Glubbes, the alleged intruder, has no baby. Just a minute — just a minute — here comes 
the stretcher now." 

Norris turned the set off and 
went to call the police. He told 
them what he knew and promised to make himself available 
for questioning if it became necessary. When he turned from the 
phone, Anne was standing in the 
bedroom doorway. She might 



have been crying a little, but she 
concealed it well. 

"What was all that?" she 

asked. 

"Woman killed a man. I happened to know the motive." 

"What was it?" 

"Neutroid trouble." 

"You meet up with a lot of 
unpleasantness in this business, 
don't you?" 

"Lot of unpleasant emotions 
tangled up in it." he admitted. 

"I know. Well, supper's been 
keeping hot for two hours. Shall 
we eat?" 

rpHEY went to bed at midn : ght, 
but it was after one when he 
became certain that his wife was 
asleep. He lay in darkness for a 
time, listening to her even breathing. Then he cautiously eased 
himself out of bed and tiptoed 
quietly through the door, carrying his shoes and trousers. He 
put them on in the kitchen and 
stole silently out to the kennels. 
A half moon hung low in a misty 
sky, and the wind was chilly out 
of the north. 

He went into the neutroid room 
and flicked a switch. A few sleepy 
chatters greeted the light. 

One at a time, he awoke twenty-three of the older doll-things 
and carried them to a large glasswalled compartment. These were 
the long-time residents ; they 
knew him well, and they came 



CONDITIONALLY HUMAN 



with him willingly — like children 
after the Piper of Hamlin. When 
he had gotten them in the glass 
chamber, he sealed the door and 
turned on the gas. The conveyor 
would automatically carry them 
on to the incinerator. 

Now he had enough cages for 
the Bcrmuda-K-99s. 

He hurriedly quit the kennels 
and went to sit on the back steps. 
His eyes were burning, but the 
thought of tears made him sicker. 
It was like an assassin crying 
while he stabbed his victim. It 
was more honest just to retch. 

When he tiptoed back inside, 
he got as far as the hall. Then he 
saw Anne's small figure framed 
in the bedroom window, silhouetted against the moonlit yard. 
She had slipped into her negligee 
and was sitting on the narrow 
windowstool, staring silently out 
at the dull red tongue of exhaust 
gases from the crematory's chimney. 

Norris backed away. He went 
to the parlor and lay down on 
the couch. 

After a while he heard her 
come into the room. She paused 
in the center of the rug, a fragile 
mist in the darkness. He turned 
his face away and waited for the 
rasping accusation. But soon she 
came to sit on the edge of the 
sofa. She said nothing. Her hand 
crept out and touched his cheek 
lightly. He felt her cool finger


tips trace a soft line up his temple. 

. "It's all right, Terry," she 
whispered. 

He kept his face averted. Her 
fingers traced a last stroke. Then 
she padded quietly back to the 
bedroom. He lay awake until 
dawn, knowing that it would 
never be all right, neither the 
creating nor the killing, until he 
— and the whole world — completely lost sanity. And then everything would be all right, only 
it still wouldn't make sense. 

A NNE was asleep when he left 
the house. The night mist had 
gathered' into clouds that made a 
gloomy morning of it. He drove 
on out in the kennel-truck, meaning to get the rest of the Bermuda-K-9°s so ■ that he could 
begin his testing. 

Still he felt the night's guilt, 
like a sticky dew that refused to 
depart with morning. Why should 
he have to kill the things? The 
answer was obvious. Society 
manufactured them because killing them was permissible. Human 
babies could not be disposed of 
when the market became glutted. 
The neutroids offered solace to 
childless women, kept them satisfied with a restricted birth rate. 
And why a restricted birth rate? 
Because by keeping the population at five billions, the Federation could insure a decent living 




 



standard for everybody. 

Where there was giving, Norris thought glumly, there was 
also taking away. Mart had always deluded himself by thinking 
that he "created," but he created 
nothing. He thought that he had 
created — with his medical science 
and his end to wars — a longer life 
for the individual. But he found 
that he had only taken the lives 
of the unborn and added them to 
the years of the aged. Man now 
had a life expectancy of eighty, 
except that he had damn little 
chance of being born to enjoy it. 

A neutroid filled the cradle in 
his stead. A neutroid that never 
ate as much, or grew up to be 
unemployed. A neutroid could be 
killed if things got tough, but 
could still satisfy a woman's craving to mother something small. 

Norris gave up thinking about 
it Eventually he would have to 
adjust to it. He was already adjusted to a world that loved the 
artificial mutants as children. He 
had been brought up in it. Emotion came in conflict with the 
grim necessities of his job. Somehow he would have to love them 
in the parlor and kill them in the 
kennel. It was only a matter of 
adjustment. 

A T noon, he brought back another dozen K-99s and installed them in his cages. There 
had been two highly reluctant 



mothers, but he skipped them 
and left the seizure to the local 
authorities. Yates had already 
brought in the three from yesterday. 

"No more scratches?" Anne 
asked him while they ate lunch. 
They did not speak of the night's 
mass -disposal. 

Norris smiled mechanically. **I 
learned my lesson yesterday. If 
they bare their fangs, I get out 
without another word. Funny 
thing though — I've got a feeling 
one mother pulled a fast one." 

"What happened?" 

"Well, I told her what I wanted 
and why. She didn't like it, but 
she let me in. I started out with 
her newt, but she wanted a receipt. So I gave her one; took the 
serial number off my checklist. 
She looked at it and said, 'Why, 
that's not Chichi's number!* I 
looked at the newt's foot, and 
sure enough it wasn't. I had to 
leave it. It was a K-99, but not 
even from Bermuda." 

"I thought they were all registered," Anne said. 

"They are. I told her she had 
the wrong neutroid, but she got 
mad. Went and got the sales receipt. It checked with her newt, 
and it was from O'Reilley's pet 
shop— right place, wrong number. I just don't get it." 

"Nothing to worry about, is it 
Terry?" 

He looked at her peculiarly.

"Ever think what might happen 
if someone started a black market 
in neutroids?" 

They finished the meal in silence. After lunch he went out 
again to gather up the rest of the 
group. By four o'clock, he had 
gotten all that were to be had 
without the threat of a warrant. 
The screams and pleas and tears 
of the owners left him gloomily 
despising himself. 

If Delmont's falsification had 
been widespread, he might have 
to turn several of the thirty-five 
over to central lab for dissection 
and ultimate destruction. That 
would bring the murderous wrath 
of their owners down upon him. 
He began to understand why bioinspectors were frequently shifted 
from one territory to another. 

On the way home, he stopped 
in Sherman II to check on the 
missing number. It was the 
largest of the Sherman communities, covering fifty blocks of commercial buildings. He parked in 
the outskirts and took a sidewalk 
escalator toward O'Reilley's address. 

It was on a dingy sidestreet, 
reminiscent of past centuries, a 
street of small bars and bowling 
alleys and cigar stores. There was 
even a shop with three gold balls 
above the entrance, but the place 
was now an antique store. A light 
mist was falling when he stepped 
off the escalator and stood in 



front of the pet shop. A sign hung 
out over the sidewalk, announcing : 

J. "DOGGY" O'REIMEY 
PETS FOR SALE 
DUMB BLONDES AND GOLDFISH 
MUTANTS FOR THE CHILDLESS 
BUY A BUNDLE OF JOY 

Norris frowned at the sign and 
wandered inside. The place was 
warm and gloomy. He wrinkled 
his nose at the strong musk of 
animal odors. O'Reilley's was not 
a shining example of cleanliness. 

Somewhere a puppy was yapping, and a parrot croaked the 
lyrics of A Chimp to Call My 
Own, which Norris recognized 
as the theme song of a popular 
soap-opera about a lady evolvotron operator. 

He paused briefly by a tank of 
silk-draped goldfish. The shop 
had a customer. An elderly lady 
was haggling with a wizened 
ifianager over the price of a half 
grown second-hand dog-F. She 
was shaking her last dog's death 
certificate under his nose and demanding a guarantee of the dog's 
alleged F-5 intelligence. The old 
man offered to swear on a Bible, 
but he demurred when it came 
to swearing on a ledger. 

The dog was saying, "Don' sell 
me, Dada. Don* se'.l me.** 

Norris smiled sardonically to 
himself. The non-human pets 
were smarter than the neutroids. 


 



A K - 1 08 could speak a dozen 
words, and a K-99 never got farther than "mamma," "pappa,** 
and "cookie." Anthropos was 
afraid to make the quasi -humans 
too intelligent, lest sentimentalists proclaim them really human. 

He wandered on toward the 
back of the building, pausing 
briefly by the cash register to inspect O'Reilley's license, which 
hung in a dusty frame on the wall 
behind the counter. "James Fallon O'Reilley . . . authorized 
dealer in mutant animals ... all 
non-predatory mammals including champanzee-K series ... license expires June 1, 2235." 

It seemed in order, although 
the expiration date was approaching. He started toward a bank of 
neutroid cages along the opposite 
wall, but O'Reilley was mincing 
across the floor to meet him. The 
customer had gone. The little 
manager wore an elfan professional smile, and his bald head 
bobbled in a welcoming nod. 

"Good day, sir, good day ! 
May I show you a dwarf kangaroo, or a — " He stopped and 
adjusted his spectacles. He 
blinked and peered as Norris 
flashed his badge. His smile 
waned. 

"I'm Agent Norris, Mr. O'Reilley. Called you yesterday for that 
rundown on K-99 sales." 

O'Reilley looked suddenly nervous. "Oh, yes. Find *em all?" 



Norris shook his head. "No. 
That's why 1 stopped by. There's 
some mistake on — " he glanced 
at his list— "on K-99-LJZ-3S1. 
Let's check it again." 

O'Reilley seemed to cringe. "No 
mistake. I gave you the buyer'i 
name." 

"She has a different number.* 

"Can I help it if she traded 
with somebody?" 

"She didn't. She bought it here. 
I saw the receipt." 

"Then she traded with one of 
my other customers!" snapped 
the old man. 

"Two of your customers have 
the same name — Aclelia Schultz? 
Not likely. Let's see your duplicate receipt book." 

O'Reilley's wrinkled face set itself into a stubborn mask. 
"Doubt if it's still around." 

Norris frowned. "Look, pop, 
I've had a rough day. I could 
start naming some things around 
here that need fixing — sanitary 
violations and such. Not to mention that sign — 'dumb blondes.* 
They outlawed that one when 
they executed that shyster doctor 
for shooting K-108s full of 
growth hormones, trying to raise 
himself a harem to sell. Besides, 
you're required to keep sales records until they've been microfilmed. There hasn't been a 
microfilming since July." 

The wrinkled face twitched 
with frustrated anger. O'Reilley

shuffled to the counter while 
Norris followed. He got a fat 
binder from under the register 
and started toward a wooden 
stairway. 

"Where you going?" Norris 
called. 

"Get my old glasses," the manager grumbled. "Can't see 
through these new things." 

"Leave the book here and 
check it," Norris offered. 

But O'Reilley was already limping quickly up the stairs. He 
seemed not to hear. He shut the 
door behind him, and Norris 
heard the lock click. The bioagent waited. Again the thought 
of a black market troubled him. 
Unauthorized neutroids could 
mean lots of trouble. 

TTMVE minutes passed before the 
old man came down the stairs. 
He said nothing as he placed the 
book on the counter. Norris noticed that his hands were trembling as he shuffled through the 
pages. 

"Let me look," said the bioagent. 

O'Reilley stepped reluctantly 
aside. Norris had memorized the 
owner's receipt number, and he 
found the duplicate quickly. He 
stared at it silently. "Mrs. Adele 
Schultz . . . chimpanzee-K-99LJZ-351." It was the number of 
the animal he wanted, but it 
wasn't the number on Mrs. 



Schultz's neutroid nor on her 
original copy of the receipt. 

He held the book up to his eye 
and aimed across the page at the 
light. O'Reilley's breathing became audible. Norris put the 
book down, folded two thicknesses of handkerchief over the 
blade of his pocketknife, and ran 
it down the seam between the 
pages. He took the sheet he 
wanted, folded it, and stowed it 
in his vest pocket. O'Reilley was 
stuttering angrily. 

Norris turned to face him coldly. "Nice erasure job, for a carbon copy." 

The old man prepared himself 
for exploding. Norris quietly put 
on his hat. 

"See you in court, O'Reilley." 

"Wait!" 

Norris turned. "Okay, I'm 
waiting." 

The old man sagged into a deflated bag of wrinkles. "Let's sit 
down first," he said weakly. 

Norris followed him up the 
stairs and into a dingy parlor. 
The tiny apartment smelled of 
boiled cabbage and sweat. An 
orange-haired neutroid lay asleep 
on a small rug in a corner. Norris 
knelt beside it and read the tattooed figures on the sole of its 
left foot— K-99-LJZ-351. Somehow he was not surprised. 

When he stood up, the old man 
was sagged in an ancient armchair, his head propped on a 




 



nd that covered his eyes. 

"Lots of good explanations, I 

ess?" Norris asked quietly. 

"Not good ones." 

"Let's hear them, anyway." 

O'Reilley sighed and straightened. He blinked at the inspector 
and spoke in a monotone. "My 
missus died five years back. We 
were class-B — allowed one child 
of our own — if we could have one. 
We couldn't. But since we were 
class-B, we couldn't own a neutroid either. Sorta got around it 
by running a pet shop. Mary — 
she always cried when we sold a 
neut. 1 sorta felt bad about it 
myself. But we never did swipe 
one. Last year this Bermuda 
shipment come in. I sold most of 
'em pretty quick, but Peony here 
—she was kinda puny. Seemed 
like nobody wanted her. Kept her 
around so long, I got attached to 
her. 'Fraid somebody'd buy her. 
So I faked the receipt and moved 
her up here." 

"That all?" 

The old man nodded. 

"Ever done this before?" 

He shook his head. 

Norris let a long silence pass 
while he struggled with himself. 
At last he said, "Your license 
could be revoked, you know." 

"I know." 

Norris ground his fist thoughtfully in his palm and stared at 
the sleeping doll-thing. "I'll take 
your books home with me to
CONDITfONALLY HUMAN 



night." he said. "I want to make 
a complete check for similar 
changes. Any objections?'* 

"None. It's the only trick l*ve 
pulled, so help me." 

"If that's true, I won't report 
you. We'll just attach a correction to that page, and you'll put 
the newt back in stock." He hesitated. "Providing it's not a deviant. I'll have to take it in for 
examination." 

A choking sound came from 
the armchair. Norris stared curiously at the old man. Moisture 
was creeping in the wrinkles 
around his eyes. 

"Something the matter?" 

O'Reilley nodded. "She's a deviant." 

"How do you know?" 

Th< dealer pulled himself erect 
and hobbled to the sleeping neutroid. He knelt beside it and 
stroked a small bare shoulder 
gently. 

"Peony," he breathed. "Peony, 
girl — wake up." 

Its fluffy tail twitched for a 
moment. Then it sat up, rubbing 
its eyes and yawning. It looked 
normal, like a two-year-old girl 
with soft brown eyes. It pouted 
at O'Reilley for awakening it. It 
aaw Norris and ignored him, apparently too sleepy to be frightened. 

"How's my Peony-girl?" the 
dealer purred. 

It licked its lips. "Wanna g'ass

o* water, Daddy," it said drowsily. 

Norris caught his breath. No 
K-99 should be able to make a 
speech that long, even when it 
reached the developmental limit. 
He glanced at O'Reilley. The old 
man nodded slowly, then went to 
the kitchen for a glass of water. 
She drank greedily and eyed her 
foster- pa rent. 

"Daddy crying." 

O'Reilley glowered at her and 
blew his nose solemnly. "Don't 
be silly, child. Now get your coat 
on and go with Mister Norris. 
He's taking you for a ride in his 
truck. Won't that be fine?" 

"I don't want to. I wanna stay 
here." 

"Peeony/ On with you!" 

She brought her coat and 
stared at Norris with childish 
contempt. "Can Daddy go, too?" 

"Be on your way !" growled 
O'Reilley. "I got things to do." 

"We're coming back?" 

"Of course you're coming back! 
Git now — or shall I get my 
spanking switch?" 

Peony strolled out the door 
ahead of Norris. 

"Oh, inspector, would you be 
punching the night latch for me 
as you leave the shop? I think 
I'll be closing for the day." 

Norris paused at the head of 
the stairs, looking back at the old 
man. But O'Reilley closed himself inside and the lock clicked. 
The agent sighed and glanced 



down at the small being beside 
him. 

"Want me to carry you. 

Peony?" 

She sniffed disdainfully. She 
hopped upon the banister and 
slid down ahead of him. Her 
motor -responses were typically 
neutroid — something like a 
monkey, something like a squirrel. But there was no question 
about it; she was one of Delmont's deviants. He wondered 
what they would do with her in 
central lab. He could remember 
no instance of an intelligent mutant getting into the market. 

Somehow he could not consign 
her to a cage in the back of the 
truck. He drove home while she 
sat beside him on the front seat. 
She watched the scenery and remained aloof, occasionally looking around to ask, "Can we go 
back now?" 

Norris could not bring himself 
to answer. 

WHEN he got home, he led her 
into the house and stopped 
in the hall to call Chief Franklin. 
The operator said, "His office 
doesn't answer, sir. Shall I give 
you the robot locator?" 

Norris hesitated. His wife came 
into the hall. She stooped to grin 
at Peony, and Peony said, "Do 
you live here, too?" Anne gasped 
and sat on the floor to stare. 
Norris said, "Cancel the call.

1**11 wait tin tomorrow." He 
dropped the phone quickly. 

"What series is it?" Anne asked 
excitedly. "I never saw one that 
could talk." 

* **// is a she" he said. "And 
she's a series unto herself. Some 
of Delmont's work." 

Peony was looking from one to 
The other of them with a baffled 
face. "Can we go back now?" 

Norris shook his head. "You're 
going to spend the night with us. 
Peony," he said softly. "Your 
daddy wants you to." 

His wife was watching him 
thoughtfully. Norris looked aside 
end plucked nervously at a coiv 
ner of the telephone book. Suddenly she caught Peony's hand 
end led her toward the kitchen. 

"Come on, baby, let's go find 
a cookie or something." 

Norris started out the front 
door, but in a moment Anne was 
back. She caught at his collar 
and tugged. "Not so fast!" 

He turned to frown. Her face 
accused him at a six-inch range. 

"Just what do you think you're 
going to do with that child?" 

He was silent for a long time.. 
"You know what I'm supposed 
to do." 

Her unchanging stare told him 
that she wouldn't accept any evasions. "I heard you trying to get 
your boss on the phone." 

"I canceled it. didn't I?" 

"Until tomorrow." 



He worked his hands nervously. "I don't know, honey — I just 
don't know." 

"They'd kill her at central lab, 
wouldn't they?" 

"Well, they'd need her as evidence in Delmont's trial." 

"They'd kill her, wouldn't 
they?" 

"When it was over — it's hard to 
say. The law says deviants must 
be destroyed, but — " 

"Well?" 

He paused miserably. "We've 
got a few days to think about it, 
honey. I don't have to make my 
report for a week." 

He sidled out the door. Looking 
back, he saw the hard determination in her eyes as she watched 
him. He knew somehow that he 
was going to lose either his job 
or his wife. Maybe both. He shuffled moodily out to the kennels to 
care for his charges. 

A GREAT silence filled the 
^* house during the evening. 
Supper was a gloomy meal. Only 
Peony spoke; she sat propped on 
two cushions at the table, using 
her silver with remarkable skill. 

Norris wondered about her intelligence. Her chronological age 
was ten months; her physical age 
was about two years ; but her 
mental age seemed to compare 
favorably with at least a three 
year old. 

Once he reached across the ta

b!e to touch her forehead. She 
eyed him curiously for a moment 
and continued eating. Her temperature was warmer than human, but not too warm for the 
normally high neutroid metabolism — somewhere around 101°. 
The rapid rate of maturation 
made I.Q. determination impossible. 

"You've got a good appetite, 
Peony," Anne remarked. 

"I like Daddy's cooking better," she said with innocent bluntness. "When can I go home?" 

Anne looked at Norris and 
waited for an answer. He managed a smile at the flame-haired 
cherub. "Tell you what we'll do. 
I'll call your daddy on the phone 
and let you say hello. Would you 
like that?" 

She giggled, then nodded. "Uhhuh ! When can we do it?" 

"Later." 

Anne tapped her fork thoughtfully against the edge of her 
plate. "I think we better have a 
nice long talk tonight, Terry," she 
said. 

"Is there anything to talk 
about?" He pushed the plate 
away. "I'm not hungry." 

HE left the table and went to 
sit in darkness by the parlor 
window, while his wife did the 
dishes and Peony played with a 
handful of walnuts on the kitchen 
floor. 

CONDITIONALLY HUMAN 



He watched the scattered lights 
of the suburbs and tried to think 

of nothing. The lights were peaceful, glimmering through the trees. 

Once there had been no lights, 
only the flickering campfires of 
hunters shivering in the forest, 
when the world was young and 
sparsely planted with the seed of 
Man. Now the world was infected 
with his lights, and with the 
sound of his engines and the roar 
of his rockets. He had inherited 
the Earth and had filled it — too 
full. 

There was no escape. His rockets had touched two of the planets, but even the new worlds 
offered no sanctuary for the unborn. Man could have babies — if 
allowed — faster than he could 
build ships to haul them away. 
He could only choose between a 
higher death rate and a lower 
birth rate. 

And unborn children were not 
eligible to vote when Man made 
his choice. 

His choice had robbed his wife 
of a biological need, and so he 
made a disposable baby with 
which to pacify her. He gave it a 
tail and unly half a mind, so that 
it could not be confused with his 
own occasional children. 

But Peony had only the tail. 
Still she was not born of the seed 
of Man. Strange seed, out of the 
jungle, warped toward the human 
pole, but still not human.

TVTORRIS heard a car approach
* ing in the street. Its headtights swung along the curb, and 
it slowed to a halt in front of the 
house. A tall, slender man in a 
dark suit climbed out and stood 
for a moment, staring toward the 
house. He was only a shadow in 
the faint street light. Norris could 
tot place him. Suddenly the man 
napped on a flashlight and 
played it over the porch. Norris 
caught his breath and darted toward the kitchen. Anne stared at 
him questioningly, while Pt-ony 
peered up from her play. 

He stooped beside her. "Listen, 
chilcV" he said quickly. "Do you 
know what a neutroid is?" 

She nodded slowly. "They play 
in cages. They don't talk." 

"Can you pretend you're a neutroid?" 

"I can play neutroid. I play 
neutroid with Daddy sometimes, 
when people come to see him. He 
^ives me candy when I play it. 
When can I go home?" 

"Not now. There's a man coming to see us. Can you play neutroid for me? We'll give you lots 
of candy. Just don't talk. Pretend you're asleep." 

"Now?" 

"Now." He heard the door 
chimes ringing. 

**Who is it?" Anne asked. 

"I don't know. He may have 
the wrong house. Take Peony in 
the bedroom. I'll answer it." 



His wife caught the child-thing 
up in her arms and hurried away. 
The chimes sounded again. Norris stalked down the hall and 
switched on the porch-light. The 
visitor was an elderly man, erect 
in his black suit and radiating 
dignity. As he smiled andnodded, 
Norris noticed his collar. A clergyman. Must have the wrong 
place, Norris thought. 

"Are you Inspector Norris?" 
The agent nodded, not daring 
to talk. 

- "I'm Father Paulson. I'm calling on behalf of a James O'Reilley. I think you know him. May 
I come in?" 

Grudgingly, Norris swung open 
the door. "If you can stand the 
smell of paganism, come on in." 

The priest chuckled politely. 
Norris led him to the parlor and 
turned on the light. He waved 
toward a chair. 

"What's this all about? Does 
O'Reilley want something?" 

Paulson smiled at the inspector's brusque tone and settled 
himself in the chair. "O'Reilley is 
a sick man," he said. 

The inspector frowned. "He 
didn't look it to me." 

"Sick of heart. Inspector. He 
came to me for advice. I couldn't 
give him any. He told me the 
story — about this Peony. I came 
to have a look at her, if I may." 

Norris said nothing for a moment. O'Reilley had better keep 


 



his mouth shut, he thought, especially around clergymen. Most of 
them took a dim view of the 
whole mutant business. 

"I didn't think you'd associate 
with O'Reilley," he said. "I 
thought you people excommunicated everybody that owns a neutroid, O'Reilley owns a whole 
shopful." 

"That's true. But who knows? 
He might get rid of his shop. May 
I see this neutroid?" 

"Why?" 

"O'Reilley said it could talk. Is 
that true or is O'Reilley suffering 
delusions? That's what I came to 
find out." 

"Neutroids don't talk." 

The priest stared at him for a 
time, then nodded slowly, as if 
approving something. "You can 
rest assured," he said quietly, 
"that I'll say nothing of this visit, 
that I'll speak to no one about 
this creature." 

Norris looked up to see his wife 
watching them from the doorway. 

"Get Peony," he said. 

"It's true then?" Paulson asked. 

"I'll let you see for yourself." 

Anne brought the small childthing into the room and set her 
on the floor. Peony saw the visitor, chattered with fright, and 
bounded upon the back of the 
sofa to sit and scold. She was 
playing her game well, Norris 
thought. 

The priest watched her with 



quiet interest. "Hello, little one.* 

Peony babbled gibberish. Paulson kept his eyes on her every 
movement. Suddenly he said, "I 
just saw your daddy, Peony. He 
wanted me to talk to you." 

Her babbling ceased. The spell 
of the game was ended. Her eyes 
went sober. Then she looked at 
Norris and pouted. "I don't want 
any candy. I wanna go home." 

Norris let out a deep breath. "I 
didn't say she couldn't talk," he 
pointed out sullenly. 

"I didn't say you did," said 
Paulson. "You invited me to see 
for myself." 

Anne confronted the clergyman. "What do you want?" she 
demanded. "The child's death? 
Did you come to assure yourself 
that she'd be turned over to the 
lab? I know your kind! You'd do 
anything to get rid of neutroids!" 

"I came only to assure myself 
that O'Reilley's sane," Paulson 
told her. 

"I don't believe you," she 
snapped. 

He stared at her in wounded 
surprise; then he chuckled. "People used to trust the cloth. Ah, 
well. Listen, my "child, you have 
us wrong. We say it's evil to create the creatures. We say also 
that it's evil to destroy them after 
they're made. Not murder, exactly, but — mockery of life, perhaps. 
It's the entire institution that's 



CONDITIONALLY HUMAN 



S3 



evil. Do you understand? As for 
this small creature of O'Reilley's 
■ — well, I hardly know what to 
make of her, but I certainly 
wouldn't wish her — uh — 
d-e-a-d." 

Peony was listening solemnly 
to the conversation. Somehow 
NorriS; sensed a disinterested 
friend, if not an ally, in the 
priest. He looked at his wife. Her 
eyes were still suspicious. 

"Tell me, Father," Norris 
ssked, "if you were in my position, what would you do?" 

Paulson fumbled with a button 
of his coat and stared at the floor 
while he pondered. "I wouldn't 
be in your position, young man. 
But if I were, I think I'd withhold 
her from my superiors. I'd also 
quit my job and go away." 

It wasn't what Norris wanted 
to hear. But his wife's expression 
suddenly changed; she looked at 
the priest with a new interest. 
"And give Peony back to O'Reilley," she added. 

"I shouldn't be giving you advice," he sriid unhappily. "I'm 
duty-bound to ask O'Reilley to 
give up his business and have 
nothing further to do with neutroids " 

"But Peony's human," Anv 
argued. "She's different." 

"I fail to agree." 

"What!" Anne confronted bim 
again. "What makes you b'iman?" 



"A soul, my child." 

Anne put her hands on her hips 
and leaned forward to glare down 
at him like something unwholesome. "Can you put a voltmeter 
between your ears and measure 
it?" 

The priest looked helplessly at 
Norris. 

"No. r ' she said. "And you can't 
do it to Peony either!" 

"Perhaps I had better go," 
Paulson said to his host. 

Norris sighed. "Maybe you better, Padre. You found out what 
you wanted to know." 

Anne stalked angrily out of the 
room, her dark hair swishing like 
a battle-pennant with each step. 
When the priest was gone, Norris 
picked up the child and held her 
in his lap. She was shivering with 
fright, as if she understood what 
had been said. Love them in the 
parlor, he thought, and kill them 
in the kennels. 

"Can I go home? Doesn't Daddy want me any more?" 

"Sure he does. baby. You just 
be good and everything'll be all 
right." 

NORRIS felt a bad taste in his 
mouth as he laid her sleeoing 
bedy on the sofa half an hour 
later. Everything was all wrong 
and it promised to remain that 
way. He couldn't give her bsck to 
O'Reilley, because she weld be 
caught again when the auditor 




 



came to microfilm the records. 
And he certainly couldn't keep 
her himself — not with other Bioagents wandering in and out every 
few days- She could not be concealed in a world where there 
were no longer any sparsely populated regions. There was nothing to do but obey the law and 
turn her over to Franklin's lab. 

He closed his eyes and shuddered. If he did that, he could do 
anything — stomach anything — 
adapt to any vicious demands 
society made of him. If he sent 
the child away to die, he would 
know that he had attained an 
"objective" outlook. And what 
more could he want from life than 
adaptation and objectivity? 

Well — his wife, for one thing. 

He left the child on the sofa, 
turned out the light, and wandered into the bedroom. Anne was 
in bed, reading. She did not look 
up when she said, "Terry, if you 
let that baby be destroyed, I'll..." 

"Don't say it," he cut in. "Any 
time you feel like leaving, you 
just leave. But don't threaten me 
with it." 

She watched him silently for a 
moment. Then she handed him 
the newspaper she had been reading. It was folded around an advertisement.

He looked at Anne curiously. 
"So?" 

She shrugged, "So there's a job, 
if you want to quit this one." 

"What's this got to do with 
Peony, if anything?" 

"We could take her with us." 

"Not a chance," he said. "Do 
you suppose a talking neutroid 
would be any safer there?" 

She demanded angrily, "Why 
should they want to destroy her?" 

Norris sat on the edge of the 
bed and thought about it. "No 
particular individual wants to, 
honey. It's the law." 

"But why?" 

"Generally, because deviants 
are unknown quantities. They 
can be dangerous." 

"That child — dangerous?" 

"Dangerous to a concept, a 
vague belief that Man is something special, a closed tribe. And 
in a practical sense, she's dangerous because -she's not a neuter. 
The Federation insists that all 
mutants be neuter and infertile, 
so it can control the mutant population. If mutants started repro

ducing, that could be a real threat 
in a world whose economy is so 
delicately balanced." 

"Well, you're not going to let 
them have her, do you hear me?" 

"I hear you,*' he grumbled. 

/~VN the following day. he went 
down to police headquarters 
to sign a statement concerning 
the motive in Doctor Georges' 
murder. As a result. Mrs. Glubbes 
was put away in the psychoward. 

"It's funny, Norris," said Chief 
Miler, "what people'll do over a 
neutroid. Like Mrs. Glubbes 
thinking that newt was her own. 
I sure don't envy you your job. 
It's a wonder you don't get your 
head blown off. You must have 
an iron stomach." 

Norris signed the paper and 
looked up briefly. "Sure, Chief. 
Just a matter of adaptation." 

"Guess so." Miler patted his 
paunch and yawned. "How you 
coming on this Delmont business? 
Picked up any deviants yet?'* 

Norris laid down the pen 
abruptly. "No! Of course not! 
What made you think I had?" 

Miler stopped in the middle of 
his yawn and stared at Norris 
curiously. "Touchy, aren't you?" 
he asked thoughtfully. "When I 
get that kind of answer from a 
prisoner, I right away start 
thinking — " 

"Save it for your interrogation 



room," Norris growled. He 
stalked quickly out of the office 
while Chief Miler tapped his pencil absently and stared after him. 

He was angry with himself for 
his indecision. He had to make 
a choice and make it soon. He 
was climbing in his car when a 
voice called after him from the 
building. He looked back to see 
Chief Miler trotting down the 
steps, his pudgy face glistening 
in the morning sun. 

"Hey, Norris! Your missus is 
cn the phone. Says it's urgent." 

Norris went back grudgingly. 
A premonition of trouble gripped 
him. 

"Phone's right there," the chief 
said, pointing with a stubby 
thumb. 

The receiver lay on the desk, 
and he could hear it saying, 
"Hello — hello — " before he picked 
it up. 

"Anne? What's the matter?" 

Her voice was low and strained, 
trying to be cheerful. "Nothing's 
the matter, darling. We have a 
visitor. Come right home, will 
you? Chief Franklin's here," 

It knocked the breath out of 
him. He felt himself going white. 
He glanced at Chief Miler, calmly sitting nearby. 

"Can you tell me about it 
now?" he asked her. 

"Not very well. Please hurry 
home. He wants to talk to you 
about the K-99s."

ave the two of them met?" 
"Yes, they have." She paused, 
as if listening to him speak, then 
said, "Oh. that! The game, honey 
■—remember the game?" 

"Good," he grunted. "I'll be 
right there." He hung up and 
started out. 

"Troubles?" the chief called 
after him. 

"Just a sick newt." he said, "if 
it's any of your business." 

CHIEF Franklin's helicopter 
was parked in the empty lot 
next door when Norris drove up 
in front of the house. The official 
heard the truck and came out on 
the porch to watch his agent walk 
up the path. His lanky, emaciated 
body was loosely draped in gray 
tweeds, and his thin hawk face 
was a dark and solemn mask. He 
was a middle-aged man, his skin 
seamed with wrinkles, but his hair 
was still abnormally black. He 
greeted Norris with a slow, almost sarcastic nod. 

"I see you don't read your 
mail. If you'd looked at it. you'd 
have known I was coming. I 
wrote you yesterday." 

"Sorry, Chief, I didn't have a 
chance to stop by the message 
office this morning." 

Franklin grunted. "Then you 
don't know why I'm here?" 
"No, sir." 

"Let's sit out on the porch,** 
Franklin said, and perched his 



bony frame on the railing. "We've 
got to get busy on these Bermuda-K-99s. Norris. How many 

have you got?" 

"Thirty-four, I think." 

"I counted thirty-five." 

"Maybe you're right. I — I'm 
not sure." 

"Found any deviants yet?" 

"Uh — I haven't run any 1<sts 
yet, sir." 

Franklin's voice went sharp. 
"Do you need a test to know 
when a neutroid is talking a blue 
streak?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"Just this. We've found at least 
a dozen of Delmont's units that 
have mental ages that correspond 
to their physical age. What's 
more, they're functioning females, 
and they have normal pituitaries. 
Know what that means?" 

"They won't take an age-set 
then," Norris said. "They'll grow 
to adulthood." 

"And have children.** 

Norris frowned. "How can they 
have children? There aren't any 
males." 

"No? Guess what we found in 
one of Delmont's incubators." 
"Not a—" 

"Yeah. And it's probably not 
the first. This business about padding his quota is baloney! Hell, 
man, he was going to start his 
own black market! He finally admitted it, after twenty-hours* 
questioning without a letup. He 



CONDITIONALLY HUMAN 



57 




was going to raise them, Norris. 
He was stealing them right out 
of the incubators before an inspector ever saw them. The K-99s 
— the numbered ones — are just 
the ones he couldn't get back. 
Lord knows how many males he's 
got hidden away someplace!" 

"What're you going to do?" 

"Do.' What do you think we'll 
do? Smash the whole scheme, 
that's what! Find the deviants 
and kill them. We've got enough 
now for lab work." 

Norris felt sick. He looked 
away. "I suppose you'll want me 
to handle the destruction, then." 

Franklin gave him a suspicious 
glance. "Yes, but why do you 
ask? You have found one, haven't 
you?" 

"Yes, sir," he admitted. 

A moan came from the doorway. Norris looked up to see his 
wife's white face staring at him 
in horror, just before she turned 
and fled into the house. Franklin's bony head lifted. 

"I see," he said. "We have a 
fixation on our deviant. Very 
well, Norris, 111 take care of it 
myself. Where is it?" 

"In the house, sir. My wife's 
bedroom." 

"Get it." 

"IVTORRIS went glumly in the 
house. The bedroom .door 
was locked. 

"Honey," he called softly. 



59 




 




There wes no answer. He knocked 
gently 

A key turned in the lock, and 
Ins wife stood facing him. Her 
eyes weTe weeping ice. 

"Stay back I" she said. He 
could see Peony behind her, sitting in the center of the floor and 
looking mystified. 

Then he saw his own service 
revolver in her trembling hand. 

"Look, honey — it's me." 

She shook her head. "No, it's 
not you. It's a man that wants 



to kill a little girl. Stay back." 

"You'd shoot, wouldn't you?" 
he asked softly. 

"Try to come in and find out," 
she invited. 

"Let me have Peony." 

She laughed, her eyes bright 
with hate. "I wonder where Terry 
went. I guess he died. Or adapted. 
I guess I'm a widow now. Stay 
back, Mister, or I'll kill you." 

Norris smiled. "Okay, I'll stay 
back. But the gun isn't lo-.d~d." 

She tried to slam the door; he 



CONDITIONALLY HUMAN 



59 



caught it with his Foot. She struck 
at him with the pistol, but he 
dragged it out of her hand. He 
pushed her aside and held her 
against the wall while she clawed 
at his arm. 

"Stop it!" he said. "Nothing 
will happen to Peony, I promise 
you!" He glanced back at the 
child-thing, who had begun to 
cry. 

Anne subsided a little, staring 
at him angrily. 

"There's no other way out, 
honey. Just trust me. She'll be 
all right." 

Breathing quickly, Anne stood 
aside and watched him. "Okay, 
Terry. But if you're lying — tell 
me, is it murder to kill a man to 
protect a child?" 

Norris lifted Peony in his arms. 
Her wailing ceased, but her tail 
switched nervously. 

"In whose law book?" he asked 
his wife. "I was wondering the 
same thing." Norris started toward the door. "By the way — find 
my instruments while I'm outside, will you?" 

"The dissecting instruments?" 
•she gasped. "If you intend — *J 

"Let's call them surgical instruments, shall we? And get 
them sterilized." 

He went on outside, carrying' 
the child. Franklin was waiting 
for him in the kennel doorway. 

"Was that Mrs. Norris I heard 
screaming?" 



Norris nodded. "Let's get this 
over with. I don't stomach it so 
welt." He let his eyes rest unhappily on the top of Peony's 
head. 

Franklin grinned at her and 
took a bit of candy out of his 
pocket. She refused it and snuggled closer to Norris. 

"When can I go home?" she 
piped. "I want Daddy." 

Franklin straightened, watching her with amusement. "You're 
going home in a few minutes, little newt, Just a few minutes." 

They went into the kennels together, and Franklin headed 
straight for the third room. He 
seemed to be enjoying the situation. Norris hating him silently, 
stopped at a workbench and 
pulled on a pair of gloves. Then 
he called after Franklin. 

"Chief, since you're in there, 
check the outlet pressure while I 
turn on the main line, will you?" 

Franklin nodded assent. He 
stood outside the gas-chamber, 
watching the dials on the door. 
Norris could see his back while 
he twisted the main-line valve. 

"Pressure's up!" Franklin 
called. 

"Okay. Leave the hatch ajar 
so it won't lock, and crack the 
' intake valves- Read it again." . 

"Got a mask for mc?" 

Norris laughed. "If you're 
scared, there's one on the shelf. 
But just open the hatch, take a 




 



reading, and close it. There's no 
danger." 

Franklin frowned at him and 
cracked the intakes. Norris quietly closed the main valve again. 

"Drops to zero!" Franklin 
called. 

"Leave it open, then. Smell 
anything?" 

"No. I'm turning it off, Norris." He twisted the intakes. 

Simultaneously, Norris opened 
the main line. 

"Pressure's up again!" 

Norris dropped his wrench and 
walked back to the chamber, 
leaving Peony perched on the 
workbench. 

"Trouble with the intakes," he 
said gruffly. "It's happened before. Mind getting your hands 
dirty with me, Chief?" 

Franklin frowned irritably. 
"Let's hurry this up, Norris. I've 
got five territories to visit." 

"Okay, but we'd better put on 
our masks." He climbed a metal 
ladder to the top of . the chamber, 
leaned over to inspect the intakes. 
On his way down, he shouldered 
a light-bulb over the door, shattering it. Franklin cursed and 
stepped back, brushing glass fragments from his head and shoulders. 

"Good thing the light was off," 
he snapped. 

Nprris handed him the gasmask and put on his own. "The 
main switch is off," he said. He 



opened the intakes again. This 
time the dials fell to normal 
open-line pressure. "Well, look — 
it's okay," he called through the 
mask. "You sure it was zero before?" 

"Of course I'm sure!" came the 
muffled reply. 

"Leave it on for a minute. We'll 
see. I'll go get the newt. Don't let 
the door close, sir. It'll start the 
automatics and we can't get it 
open for half an hour." 

"I know, Norris. Hurry up." 

Norris left him standing just 
outside the chamber, propping 
the door open with his foot. A 
faint wind was coming through 
the opening. It should reach an 
explosive mixture quickly with 
the hatch ajar. 

He stepped into the next room, 
waited a moment, and jerked the 
switch. The roar was deafening 
as the exposed tungsten filament 
flared and detonated the escaping 
anesthetic vapor. Norris went to 
cut off the main line. Peony was 
crying plaintively. He moved to 
the door and glanced at the 
smouldering remains of Franklin. 

TREBLING no emotion what*■ ever, Norris left the kennels, 
carrying the sobbing child under 
one arm. His wife stared at him 
without understanding. 

"Here, hold Peony while I call 
the police," he said. 

"Police? What's" happened?" 



CONDITIONALLY HUMAN 



41 



He dialed quickly. "Chief 
Miler? This is Norris. Get over 
here quick. My gas chamber exploded — killed Chief Agent 
Franklin. Man, it's awful! Hurry." 

He hung up and went back to 
the kennels. He selected a normal 
Bermuda-K-99 and coldly killed 
it with a wrench. "You'll serve 
for a deviant," he said, and left 
it lying in the middle of the floor. 

Then he went back to the 
house, mixed a sleeping capsule 
in a glass of water, and forced 
Peony to drink it. 

"So she'll be out when the cops 
come," he explained to Anne. 

She stamped her foot. "Will 
you tell me what's happened?" 

"You heard me on the phone. 
Franklin accidentally died. That's 
all you have to know." 

He carried Peony out and 
locked her in a cage. She was too 
sleepy to protest, and she was 
dozing when the police came. 

Chief Miler strode about the 
three rooms like a man looking 
for a burglar at midnight. He 
nudged the body of the neutroid 
with his foot. "What's this, Norris?" 

"The deviant we were about to 
destroy. I finished her with a 
wrench." 

"I thought you said there 
weren't any deviants." 

"As far as the public's concerned, there aren't. I couldn't 
see that it was any of your busi


ness. It still isn't." 

"I see. It may become my business, though. How'd the blast 
happen?" 

Norris told him the story up 
to the point of the detonation. 
"The light over the door was 
loose. Kept flickering on and off. 
Franklin reached up to tighten 
it. Must have been a little gas in 
the socket. Soon as he touched 
it— wham !" 

"Why was the door open with 
the gas on?" 

"I told you — we were checking 
the intakes. If you close the door, 
it starts the automatics. Then 
you can't get it open till the 
cycle's finished." 

"Where were you?" 

"I'd gone to cut off the gas 
again." 

"Okay, stay in the house until 
we're finished out here." 

WHEN Norris went back in 
the house, his wife's white 
face turned slowly toward him. 

She sat stiffly by the living 
room window, looking sick. Her 
voice was quietly frightened. 

"Terry, I'm sorry about everything." 
"Skip it." 

"What did you do?" 

He grinned sourly. "I adapted 
to an era. Did you find the instruments?" 

She nodded. "What are they 
for?" 



62 




 



"To cut off a tail and skin a 
tattooed foot. Go to the store 
and buy some brown hair-dye 
and a pair of boy's trousers, age 
two. Peony's going to get a crewcut. From now on, she's Mike." 

"We're class-C, Terry! We 
can't pass her off as our own." 

"We're class-A, honey. I'm going to forge a heredity certificate." 

Anne put her face in her hands 
and rocked slowly to and fro. 

"Don't feel bad, baby. It was 
Franklin or a little girl. And from 
now on, it's society or the Norrises.'* 

"Whafll we do?" 

"Go to Atlanta and work for 
Anthropos. I'll take up where 
Delmont left off." 

"Terry!" 

"Peony will need a husband. 
They may find all of Delmont's 
males. I'll make her one. Then 
we'll see if a pair of chimp-Ks 
can do better than their makers." 

Wearily, he stretched out on 
the sofa. 

"What about that priest? Suppose he tells about Peony. Suppose he guesses about Franklin 
and tells the police?" 

"The police." he said, "would 
then smell a motive. They'd figure it out and I'd be finished. 
We'll wait and see. Let's don't 
talk; I'm tired. We'll just wait 
for Miler to come in." 

She began rubbing his temples 



gently, and he smiled. 

"So we wait," she said. "Shall 
I read to you, Terry?" 

"That would be pleasant," he 
murmured, closing his eyes. 

She slipped away, but returned 
quickly. He heard the rustle of 
dry pages and smelted musty 
leather. Then her voice came, 
speaking old words softly. And he 
thought of the small child-thing 
lying peacefully in her cage while 
angry men stalked about her. A 
small life with a mind; she came 
into the world as quietly as a 
thief, a burglar in the crowded 
house of Man. 

"/ will send my /ear before 
thee, and I will destroy the peoples before whom thou shaft 
come, sending hornets to drive 
out the Hevite and the Canaanite 
and the Hethite before thou enterest the land. Little by little I 
will drive them out before thee, 
till thou be increased, and dost 
possess the land. Then shaJt thou 
be to me a new people, and I to 
thee a God . . ." 

And Dn the quiet afternoon in 
May. while he waited for the police to finish puzzling in the kennels, it seemed to Terrell Norris 
that an end to scheming and 
pushing and arrogance was not 
too far ahead. It should be a 
pretty good world then. 

He hoped Man could fit into it 
somehow.
