DR. KOMETEVSKY'S DAY By FRITZ LEIBER 



"BUT it's al predicted 
here! It even names 
this century for the 
next reshuffling of the planets," 
Celeste Wolver looked up unwillingly at the book her friend 



Madge Carnap held aloft like a 
torch. She made out the illstamped title, The Dance of the 
Planets. There was no mistaking 
the time of its origin; only paper 
from the Twentieth Century aged 









to that particularly nasty shade 
of brown. Indeed , the book 
seemed to Celeste a brown old 
witch resurrected from the Last 
Age of Madness to confound a 
world growing sane, and she 
couldn't help shrinking back a 
trifle toward her husband Theodor. 

He tried to come to her rescue. 
"Only predicted in the vaguest 
way. As I understand it, Kometevsky claimed, on the basis of 
a lot of evidence drawn from folklore, that the planets and their 
moons trade positions every so 
often." 

"As if they were playing Going 
to Jerusalem, or musical chairs," 
Celeste chimed in, but she 
couldn't make it sound funny. 

"Jupiter was supposed to have 
started as the outermost planet, 
and is to end up in the orbit of 
Mercury," Theodor continued. 
"Well, nothing at all like that 
has happened." 

"But it's begun," Madge said 
with conviction. "Phobos and 
Deimos have disappeared. You 
can't argue away that stubborn 
little fact." 

That was the trouble; you 
couldn't. Mars' two tiny moons 
had simply vanished during a 
period when, as was generally the 
case, the eyes of astronomy 
weren't on them. Just some hundred-odd cubic miles of rock — 
the merest cosmic flyspecks — yet 



they had carried away with them 
the security of a whole world. 

T OOKING at the lovely garden 
landscape around her, Celeste Wolver felt that in a moment the shrubby hills would 
begin to roll like waves, the 
charmingly aimless paths twist 
like snakes and sink in the green 
sea, the sparsely placed skyscrapers dissolve into the misty clouds 
they pierced. 

People must have felt like this, 
she thought, when A ris t arches 
first hinted and Copernicus told 
them that the solid Earth under 
their feet was falling dizzily 
through space. Only it's worse for 
us, because they couldn't see that 
anything had changed. We can. 

"You need something to cling 
to." she heard Madge say. "Dr. 
Kornetevsky was the only person 
who ever had an inkling that anything like this might happen. I 
was never a Kometevskyite before. Hadn't even heard of the 
man." 

She said it almost apologetically. In fact, standing there so 
frank and anxious-eyed, Madge 
looked anything but a fanatic, 
which made it much worse. 

"Of course, there are several 
more convincing alternate explanations ..." Theodor began 
hesitantly, knowing very well that 
there weren't. If Phobos and 
Deimos had suddenly disinte

grated, surely Mars Base would 
have noticed something. Of 
course there was the Disordered 
Space Hypothesis, even if it was 
little more than the chance phrase 
of a prominent physicist pounded 
upon by an eager journalist. And 
in any case, what sense of security were you left with if you 
admitted that moons and planets 
might explode, or drop through 
unseen holes in space? So he 
ended up by taking a different 
tack : "Besides, if Phobos and 
Deimos simply shot off somewhere, surely they'd have been 
picked up by now by 'scope or 
radar." 

"Two balls of rock just a- few 
miles in diameter?" Madge questioned. "Aren't they smaller than 
many of the asteroids? I'm no 
astronomer, but I think I'm 
right." 

And of course she was. 

She swung the book under her 
arm. "Whew, it's heavy," she 
observed, adding in slightly 
scandalized tones, "Never been 
microfilmed." She smiled nervously and looked them up and 
down. "Going to a party?" she 
asked. 

Theodor's scarlet cloak and Celeste's green culottes and silver 
jacket justified the question, but 
they shook their heads. 

"Just the normally flamboyant 
garb of the family," Celeste said, 
while Theodor explained, "As 



it happens, we're bound on business connected with the disappearance. We Wolvers practically 
constitute a sub-committee of the 
Congress for the Discovery of 
New Purposes. And since a lot 
of varied material comes to our 
attention, we're going to see if 
any of it correlates with this bit 
of astronomical sleight-of-hand." 

Madge nodded. "Give you 
something to do, at any rate. 
Well, I must be off. The Buddhist temple has lent us their 
place for a meeting." She gave 
them a woeful grin. "See you 
when the Earth jumps." 

Theodor said to Celeste, "Come 
on. dear. We'll be late." 

But Celeste didn't want to 
move too fast. "You know, 
Teddy." she said uncomfortably, 
"all this reminds me of those old 
myths where too much good fortune is a sure sign of coming disaster. It was just too much luck, 
our great- grandparents missing 
World III and getting the World 
Government started a thousand 
years ahead of schedule. Luck 
like that couldn't last, evidently. 
Maybe we've gone too fast with 
a lot of things, like space-flight 
and the Deep Shaft and — " she 
hesitated a bit — "complex marriages. I'm a woman. I want complete security. Where am I to find 
it?" 

"In me," Theodor said 
promptly. 



DR. KOMETEVSKY'S DAY 



67 



"In you?" Celeste questioned, 
walking slowly. "But you're just 
one-third of my husband. Perhaps I should look for it in Edmund or Ivan." 

"You angry with me about 
something?" 

"Of course not. But a woman 
wants her source of security 
whole. In a crisis like this, it's 
disturbing to have it divided." 

"Well, we are a whole and, I 
believe, indivisible family," Theodor told her warmly. "You're not 
suggesting, are you, that we're going to be punished for our polygamous sins by a cosmic catastrophe? Fire from heaven and 
all that?" 

"Don't be silly. I just wanted 
to give you a picture of my feeling." Celeste smiled. "I guess 
none of us realized how much 
we've come to depend on the idea 
of unchanging scientific law. 
Knocks the props from under 
you." 

Theodor nodded emphatically. 
"All the more reason to get a line 
on what's happening as quickly 
as possible. You know, it's fantastically far-fetched, but I think 
the experience of persons with 
Extra-Sensory Perception may 
give us a clue. During the past 
three or four days there's been a 
remarkable similarity in the 
dreams of ESPs all over the 
planet. I 'm going to present 
the evidence at the meeting." 



Celeste looked up at him. "So 
that's why Rosalind's bringing 
Frieda's daughter?" 

"Dotty is your daughter, too, 
and Rosalind's," Theodor reminded her. 

"No, just Frieda's," Celeste 
said bitterly. "Of course you may 
be the father. One-third of a 
chance." 

Theodor looked at her sharply, 
but didn't comment. "Anyway, 
Dotty will be there," he said. 
"Probably asleep by now. All the 
ESPs have suddenly seemed to 
need more sleep." 

As they talked, it had been 
growing darker, though the luminescence of the path kept it from 
being bothersome. And now the 
cloud rack parted to the cast, 
showing a single red planet low 
on the horizon. 

"Did you know," Theodor said 
suddenly, "that in Go//»Ver's 
Travels Dean Swift predicted that 
better telescopes would show 
Mars to have two moons? He got 
the sizes and distances and periods damned accurately, too. One 
of the few really startling coincidences of reality and literature." 

"Stop being eerie," Celeste said 
sharply. But then she went 
on, "Those names Phobos and 
Deimos — they're Greek, aren't 
they? What do they mean?" 

Theodor lost a step. "Fear and 
Terror," he aaid unwillingly. 



tfi 




 



"Now don't go taking that for an 
omen. Most of the mythological 
names of major and minor ancient gods had been taken — the 
bodies in the Solar System are 
named that way, of course — and 
these were about all that were 
available." 

It was true, but it didn't comfort him much. 

TAM a God, Dotty was dreaming, ana* I want to be by my~ 
self and think. I and my godfriends like to keep some of our 
thoughts secret, but the other 
gods have forbidden us to. 

A little smile nickered across 
the lips of the sleeping girl, and 
the woman in gold tights and 
gold-spangled jacket leaned forward thoughtfully. In her dignity 
and simplicity and straight spined grace, she was rather like a 
circus mother watching her sick 
child before she went out for the 
trapeze act. 

/ and my god-friends sail off 
in our great round silver boats, 
Dotty went on dreaming. The 
other gods are angry and scared. 
They are frightened of the 
thoughts we may think in secret. 
They follow us to hunt us down. 
There are many more of them 
than of us. 

AS Celeste and Theodor entered 
the committee room, Rosalind Wolver — a glitter of plati


num against darkness — came in 
through the opposite door and 
softly shut it behind her. Frieda, 
a fair woman in blue robes, got 
up from the round table. 

Celeste turned away with outward casualness as Theodor 
kissed his two other wives. She 
was pleased to note that Edmund 
seemed impatient too. A figure in 
close-fitting black, unrelieved except for two red arrows at the 
collar, he struck her as embodying very properly the serious, 
fateful temper of the moment. 

He took two briefcases from 
his vest pocket and tossed them 
down on the table beside one of 
the microfilm, projectors. 

"I suggest we get started without waiting for Ivan," he said. 

Frieda frowned anxiously. "It's 
ten minutes since he phoned from 
the Deep Space Bar to say he 
was starting right away. And 
that's hardly two minutes walk." 

Rosalind instantly started tor 
ward the outside door. 

"I'll check," she explained. "Oh, 
Frieda, I've set the mike so you'll 
hear if Dotty calls." 

Edmund threw up his hands. 
"Very well, then," he said and 
walked over, switched on the picture and stared out moodily. 

Theodor and Frieda got out 
their briefcases, switched on projectors, and began silently checking through their material. 

Celeste fiddled with the TV 



DR. KOMETEVSKY'S DAT 



and got a newscast. But she found 
her eyes didn't want to absorb 
the blocks of print that rather 
swiftly succeeded each other, 
so, after a few moments, she 
shrugged impatiently and 
switched to audio. 

At the noise, the others looked 
around at her with surprise and 
some irritation, but in a few moments they were also listening. 

"The two rocket ships sent out 
from Mars Base to explore the 
orbital positions of Phobos and 
Deimos — that is, the volume of 
space they'd be occuping if their 
positions had remained normal — 
report finding masses of dust and 
larger debris. The two masses of 
fine debris are moving in the 
same orbits and at the same velocities as the two vanished 
moons, and occupy roughly the 
same volumes of space, though 
the mass of material is hardly a 
hundredth that of the moons. 
Physicists have ventured no statements as to whether this constitutes a confirmation of the Disintegration Hypothesis. 

"However, we're mighty pleased 
at this news here. There's a 
marked lessening of tension. The 
finding of the debris — solid, tangible stuff — seems to lift the 
whole affair out of the supernatural miasma in which some of 
us have been tempted to plunge 
it One-hundredth of the moons 
has been found. 



The rest will also be!" 

Edmund had turned his back 
on the window. Frieda and Theodor had switched off their projectors. 

"Meanwhile, Earthlings are going about their business with a 
minimum of commotion, meeting 
with considerable calm the 
strange threat to the fabric of 
their Solar System. Many, of 
course, are assembled in churches 
and humanist temples. Kometevskyites have staged helicopter 
processions at Washington, Peking, Pretoria, and Christiana, demanding that instant preparations be made for — and I quote 
—'Earth's coming leap through 
space.' They have also formally 
challenged all astronomers to produce an explanation other than 
the one contained in that strange 
book so recently conjured from 
oblivion, The Dance of the 
Planets. 

"That about winds up the story 
for the present. There are no 
new reports from Interplanetary 
Radar, Astronomy, or the other 
rocket ships searching in the extended Mars volume. Nor have 
any statements been issued by the 
various groups working on the 
problem in Astrophysics, Cosmic 
Ecology, the Congress for the 
Discovery of New Purposes, and 
so forth. Meanwhile, however, we 
can take courage from the words 
of a poem written even before Dr.

OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Kometevsky's book : 

"This Earth is not the steadfast place 
. We landsmen build upon; 
Fjom deep to deep she varies pace. 
And while she comes is gone. 
Berleatli my feet I feel 
Her smooth bulk heave and dip; 
Willi velvet plunge and soft uprecl 
She swings and steadies to her keel 
Like a gallant, gallant ship." 

W7HILE the TV voice intoned 
" the poem, growing richer as 
emotion caught it up, Celeste 
looked around her at the others. 
Frieda, with her touch of feminine helplessness showing more 
than ever through her businesslike poise. Theodor leaning forward from his scarlet cloak 
thrown back, smiling the halfsmile with which he seemed to 
face even the unknown. Black 
Edmund, masking a deep uncertainty with a strong show of decisiveness. 

In short, her family. She knew 
their every quirk and foible. And 
yet now they seemed to her a 
million miles away, figures seen 
through the wrong end of a telescope. 

Were they really a family? 
Strong sources of mutual strength 
and security to each other? Or 
had they merely been playing 
family, experimenting with their 
notions of complex marriage like 
a bunch of silly adolescents? Butterflies taking advantage of good 
weather to wing together in a 



glamorous, artificial dance — until 
outraged Nature decided to wipe 
them out? 

As the poem was ending. Celeste saw the door open and Rosalind come slowly in. The Golden 
Woman's face was white as the 
paths she had been treading. 

Just then the TV voice quickened with shock. "News! Lunar 
Observatory One reports that, although Jupiter is just about to 
pass behind the Sun, a good coronagraph of the planet has been 
obtained. Checked and rechecked, 
it admits of only one interpretation, which Lunar One feels dutybound to release. Jupiter's fourteen moons are no longer visible!" 

The chorus of remarks with 
which the Wolvers would otherwise have received this was 
checked by one thing: the fact 
that Rosalind seemed not to hear 
it. Whatever was on her mind prevented even that incredible statement from penetrating. 

She walked shakily to the table 
and put down a briefcase, one 
end of which was smudged with 
dirt. 

Without looking at them, she 
said, "Ivan left the Deep Space 
Bar twenty minutes ago, said he 
was coming straight here. On my 
way back I searched the path. 
Midway I found this half-buried 
in the dirt. I had to tug to get it 
out — almost as if it had been cemented into the ground. Do you

KOMETEVSKY'S DAY

feel how the dirt seems to be in 
the leather, as if it had lain for 
years in the grave?" 

By now the others were fingering the small case of microfilms 
they had seen so many times in 
Ivan's competent hands. What 
Rosalind said was true. It had a 
gritty, unwholesome feel to it. 
Also, it felt strangely heavy. 

"And see what's written on it," 
she added. 

They turned it over. Scrawled 
with white pencil in big, hasty, 
frantic letters were two words: 

"Going down!" 

The other gods, Dotty dreamt, 
are combing the whole Universe 
for us. We have escaped them 
many times, but now our tricks 
are almost used up. There are no 
doors going out of the Universe 
and our boats are silver beacons 
to th* hunters. So we decide to 
di&gu.ne them in the only way 
they ( an be disguised. It is our 
fast cfance, 

EDMUND rapped the table to 
gain the family's attention. 
"I'd say we've done everything 
we can for the moment to find 
Ivan. We've made a thorough local search. A wider one. which 
we can't conduct personally, is in 
progress. All helpful agencies 
have been alerted and descriptions are being broadcast. I suggest we get on with the business 



of the evening — which may very 
well be connected with Ivan's 
disappearance." 

One by one the others nodded 
and took their places at the round 
table. Celeste made a great effort to throw off the feeling of unreality that had engulfed her and 
focus attention on her microfilms. 

"I'll take over Ivan's notes," 
she heard Edmund say. "They're 
mainly about the Deep Shaft." 

"How far have they got with 
that?" Frieda asked idly. "Twenty-five miles?" 

"Nearer thirty, I believe," Edmund answered, "and still going 
down." 

At those last two words they all 
looked up quickly. Then their 
eyes went toward Ivan's briefcase. 

Our trick has succeeded, Dotty 
dreamt. The other gods have 
passed our hiding place a dozen 
times without noticing. They 
search the Universe lor us many 
times in vain. They finally decide that we have found a door 
going out of the Universe. Yet 
they fear us all the more. They 
think of us as devils who will 
some day return through the door 
to destroy them. So they watch 
everywhere. We lie quietly smiling in our camouflaged boats, yet 
hardly daring to move or think, 
for iear that the faintest echoes 
of our doings will give them a 



72 




 



clue. Hundreds of millions of 
years pass by. They seem to us 
no more than drugged hours in 
a prison. 

Theodor rubbed his eyes and 
pushed his chair back from the 
table. "We need a break." 

Frieda agreed wearily. "We've 
gone through everything." 

"Good idea," Edmund said 
briskly. "I think we've hit on 
several crucial points along the 
way and half disentangled them 
from the great mass of inconsequential material. I'll finish up 
that part of the job right now 
and present my case when we're 
all a bit fresher. Say half an 
hour?" 

Theodor nodded heavily, pushing up from his chair and hitching 
his cloak over a shoulder. 

"I'm going out for a drink," 
he informed them. 

After several hesitant seconds, 
Rosalind quietly followed him. 
Frieda stretched out on a couch 
and closed her eyes. Edmund 
scanned microfilms tirelessly, 
every now and then setting one 
aside. 

Celeste watched him for a 
minute, then sprang up and 
started toward the room where 
Dotty was asleep. But midway 
she stopped. 

Not my child, she thought bitterly. Frieda's her mother, Rosalind her nurse. I'm nothing at alt. 



Just one of the husband's girt 
friends. A lady of uneasy virtue 
in a dissolving world. 

But then she straightened her 
shoulders and went on. 

¥JOSALIND didn't catch up 
-**-with Theodor. Her footsteps 
were silent and he never looked 
back along the path whose feeble 
white glow rose only knee-high, 
lighting a low strip of shrub and 
mossy treetrunk to either side, no 
more. 

It was a little chilly. She drew 
on her gloves, but she didn't 
hurry. In fact, she fell farther and 
farther behind the dipping tail 
of his scarlet cloak and his plodding red shoes, which seemed to 
move disembodied, like those in 
the fairy tale. 

When she reached the point 
where she had found Ivan's briefcase, she stopped altogether. 

A breeze rustled the leaves, and, 
moistly brushing her cheek, 
brought forest scents of rot and 
mold. After a bit she began to 
hear the furtive scurryings and 
scuttlings of forest creatures. 

She looked around her halfheartedly, suddenly realizing the 
futility of her quest. What clues 
could she hope to find in this 
knee-high twilight? And they'd 
thoroughly combed the place 
earlier in the night. 

Without warning, an eerie tingling went through her and she 



OR. 



KOMETEV SKY'S DAY 



73 



was seized by a horror of the 
cold, grainy Earth underfoot — 
an ancestral terror from the days 
when men shivered at ghost 
stories about graves and tombs. 

A tiny detail persisted in bulking larger and larger in her mind 
— the unnaturalness of the way 
the Earth had impregnated the 
corner of Ivan's briefcase, almost 
as if dirt and leather co-existed 
in the same space. She remembered the queer way the partly 
buried briefcase had resisted her 
first tug, like a rooted plant. 

She felt cowed by the mysterious night about her, and literally 
dwarfed, as if she had grown several inches shorter. She roused 
herself and started forward. 

Something held her feet. 

They were ankle-deep in the 
path. While she looked in fright 
and horror, they began to sink 



still lower into the ground. 

She plunged frantically, trying 
to jerk loose. She couldn't. She 
had the panicky feeling that the 
Earth had not only trapped but 
invaded her; that its molecules 
were creeping up between the 
molecules of her flesh; that the 
two were becoming one. 

And she was sinking faster. 
Now knee-deep, thigh-deep, hipdeep, waist-deep. She beat at the 
powdery path with her hands and 
threw her body from side to side 
in agonized frenzy like some sinner frozen in the ice of the innermost circle of the ancients' hell. 
And always the sense of the dank, 
grainy tide rose inside as well as 
around her. 

She thought, he'd just have had 
time to scribble that note on his 
briefcase and toss it away. She 
jerked off a glove, leaned out as 




74 




 



KOMETEVSKY'S DAY 7S 



far as she could, and made a frantic effort to drive its firigers into 
the powdery path. Then the 
Earth mounted to her chin, her 
nose, and covered her eyes. 

She expected blackness, but it 
was as if the light of the path 
stayed with her, making a little 
glow all around. She saw roots, 
pebbles, black rot, worn tunnels, 
worms. Tier on tier of them, her 
vision penetrating the solid 
ground. And at the same time, the 
knowledge that these same sorts 
of things were coursing up 
through her. 

AND still she continued to sink 
at a speed that increased, 
as if the law of gravitation applied to her in a diminished way. 
She dropped from black soil 
through gray clay and into pale 
limestone. 

Her tortured, rock-permeated 
lungs sucked at rock and drew 
in air. She wondered madly if a 
volume of air were falling with 
her through the stone. 

A glitter of quartz. The momentary openness of a foot-high 
cavern with a trickle of water. 
And then she was sliding down a 
black basalt column, half inside 
it, half inside gold-flecked ore. 
Then just black basalt. And always faster. 

It grew hot, then hotter, as if 
she were approaching the mythical eternal fires. 

76 



AT first glance T h eo d o r 
thought the Deep Space Bar 
was empty. Then he saw a figure 
hunched monkeylike on the last 
stool, almost lost in the blue 
shadows, while behind the bar, 
her crystal dress blending with 
the* tiers of sparkling - glasses, 
stood a grave-eyed young girl 
who could hardly have been 
fifteen. 

The TV was saying, "... in 
addition, a number of mysterious disappearances of high-rating 
individuals have been reported. 
These are thought to be cases of 
misunderstanding, illusory apprehension, and impulse traveling — 
a result of the unusual stresses 
of the time. Finally, a few suggestible individuals in various 
parts of the globe, especially the 
Indian Peninsula, have declared 
themselves to .be 'gods' and' in 
some way responsible for current 
events. 

"It is thought — " 
The girl switched off the TV 
and took Theodor's order, explaining casually, "Joe wanted to 
go to a Kometevskyite meeting, 
so I took over for him." When 
she had prepared Theodor's highball, she announced, "I'll have a 
drink with you gentlemen," and 
squeezed herself a glass of pomegranite juice. 

The monkeylike figure muttered, "Scotch -and -soda," then 
turned toward Edmund and 


 



asked, "And what is your reaction to all this, sir?" 

THEODOR recognized the 
shrunken wrinkle-seamed face. 
It was Colonel Fortescue, a military antique long retired from 
the Peace Patrol and reputed to 
have seen actual fighting in the 
Last Age of Madness. Now, for 
some reason, the face sported a 
knowing smile. 

Theodor shrugged. Just then 
the TV "big news" light blinked 
blue and the girl switched on 
audio. The Colonel winked at 
Theodor,. 

"... confirming the disappearance of Jupiter's moons. But two 
other utterly fantastic reports 
have just been received. First, 
Lunar Observatory One says that 
it is visually tracking fourteen 
small bodies which it believes 
may be the lost moons of Jupiter. 
They are moving outward from 
the Solar System at an incredible 
velocity and are already beyond 
the orbit of Saturn!'* 
The Colonel said, "Ah!" 
"Second, Palomar reports a 
large number of dark bodies approaching the Solar System at an 
equally incredible velocity. They 
are at about twice the distance 
of Pluto, but closing in fast! We 
will be on the air with further details as soon as possible." 
The Colonel said, "Ah-ha!" 
Theodor stared at him. The old 



man's self-satisfied poise was almost amusing. 

"Are you a Kometevskyite?" 
Theodor asked him. 

The Colonel laughed. "Of 
course not, my boy. Those poor 
people are fumbling in the dark. 
Don't you see what's happened?" 

"Frankly, no." 

The Colonel leaned toward 
Theodor and whispered gruffly, 
"The Divine Plan. God is a military strategist, naturally." 

Then he lifted the scotch -andsoda in his clawlike hand and 
took a satisfying swallow. 

"I knew it all along, of course," 
he went on musingly, "but thii 
last news makes it as plain as a 
rocket blast, at least to anyone 
who knows military strategy. 
Look here, my boy, suppose you 
were commanding a fleet and got 
wind of the enemy's approach— 
what would you do? Why, you'd 
send your scouts and destroyers 
fanning out toward them. Behind 
that screen you'd mass your 
heavy ships. Then — " 

"You don't mean to imply — " 
Theodor interrupted. 

The girl behind the bar looked 
at them both cryptically. 

"Of course I do!" the Colonel 
cut in sharply. "It's a war between the forces of good and evil. 
The bright suns and planets are 
on one side, the dark on the 
other. 

The moons are the destroy

crs, Jupiter and Saturn are the 
big battleships, while we're on a 
heavy cruiser, I'm proud to say. 
We'll probably go into action 
soon. Be a corking fight, what? 
And all by divine strategy!" 

He chuckled and took another 
big drink. Theodor looked at 
him sourly. The girl behind the 
bar polished a glass and said 
nothing. 

T~\OTTY suddenly began to 
turn and toss, and a look 
of terror came over her sleeping 
face. Celeste leaned forward apprehensively. 

The child's lips worked and 
Celeste made out the sleepy-fuzzy 
words: "They've found out where 
we're hiding. They're coming to 
get us. No! Please, no!" 

Celeste's reactions were mixed. 
She felt worried about Dotty and 
at the same time almost in terror 
of her, as if the little girl were 
an agent of supernatural forces. 
She told herself that this fear was 
an expression of her own hostility, 
yet she didn't really believe it. 
She touched the child's hand. 

Dotty's eyes opened without 
making Celeste feel she had quite 
come awake. After a bit she 
looked at Celeste and her little 
lips parted in a smile. 

"Hello," she said sleepily. "I've 
been having such funny dreams." 
Then , after a pause, frowning, 
*'I really am a god, you know. It 



feels very queer." 

"Yes, dear?" Celeste prompted 
uneasily. "Shall I call Frieda?" 

The smile left Dotty's lips. 
"Why do you act so nervous 
around me?" she asked. "Don't 
you love me. Mummy?" 

Celeste started at the word. Her 
throat closed. Then, very slowly, 
her face broke into a radiant 
smile. "Of course I do, darling. I 
love you very much." 

Dotty nodded happily, her eyes 
already closed again. 

There was a sudden flurry of 
excited voices beyond the door. 
Celeste heard her name called. 
She stood up. 

"I'm going to have to go out 
and talk with the others," she 
said. "If you want me, dear, just 
call." 

"Yes, Mummy." 

F^DMUND rapped for attention. Celeste, Frieda, and 
Theodor glanced around at him. 
He looked more f right f ul ly 
strained, they realized, than even 
they felt. His expression was a 
study in suppressed excitement, 
but there were also signs of a 
knowledge that was almost too 
overpowering for a human being 
to bear. 

His voice was clipped, rapid. 
"I think it's about time we 
stopped worrying about our own 
affairs and thought of those of 
the Solar System, partly because

I think they have a direct bearing 

on the disappearances of Ivan 
and Rosalind. As I told you, I've 
been sorting out the crucial items 
from the material we've been presenting. There are roughly four 
of those items, as I see it. It's 
rather like a mystery story. I 
wonder if, hearing those four 
clues, you will come to the same 
conclusion I have." 

The others nodded. 

"First, there are the latest reports from Deep Shaft, which, as 
you know, has been sunk to investigate deep-Earth conditions. 
At approximately twenty -nine 
miles below the surface, the delvers have encountered a metallic 
obstruction which they have tentatively named the duraspherc, 
It resists their hardest drills, their 
Strongest corrosives. They have 
extended a side -tunnel at that 
level for a quarter of a mile. Delicate measurements, made possible 
by the mirror -smooth metal surface, show that the duraspherc 
has a slight curvature that is 
almost exactly equal to the curvature of the Earth itself. The suggestion is that deep borings made 
anywhere in the world would encounter the durasphere at the 
same depth. 

"Second, the movements of the 
moons of Mars and Jupiter, and 
particularly the debris left behind 
by the moons of Mars. Granting 
Phobos and Deimos had duras


pheres proportional in size to that 
of Earth, then the debris would 
roughly equal in amount the material in those^ two duraspheres* 
rocky envelopes. The suggestion 
is that the two duraspheres suddenly burst from their envelopes 
with such itanic velocity as to 
leave those disrupted envelopes 
behind." 

It was deadly quiet in the committee room. 

"Thirdly, the disappearances of 
Ivan and Rosalind, and especially 
the baffling hint — from Ivan's 
message in one case and Rosalind's downward-pointing glove 
in the other — that they were both 
somehow drawn into the depths 
of the Earth. 

"Finally, the dreams of the 
ESPs, which agree overwhelmingly in the following points: A 
group of beings separate themselves from a godlike and telepathic race because they insist 
on maintaining a degree of mental 
privacy. They flee in great boats 
or ships of some sort. They are 
pursued on such a scale that 
there is no hiding place for them 
anywhere in the universe. In some 
manner they successfully camouflage their ships. Eons pass and 
their still -fanatical pursuers do 
not penetrate their secret. Then, 
suddenly, they are detected." 

Edmund waited. "Do you see 
what I'm driving at?" he asked 
hoarsely.

HE could tell from their looks 
that the others did, but 
couldn't bring themselves to put 
it into words. 

"I suppose it's the time-scale 
and the value-scale that are so 
hard for us to accept," he said 
softly. "Much more, even, than 
the size-scale. The thought that 
there are creatures in the Universe to whom the whole career 
of Man — in fact, the whole career of life — is no more than a 
few thousand or hundred thousand years. And to whom Man is 
no more than a minor stage property — a trifling part of a clever 
job of camouflage." 

This time he went on, "Fantasy 
writers have at times hinted all 
sorts of odd things about the 
Earth — that it might even be a 
kind of single living creature, or 
honeycombed with inhabited caverns, and so on. But I don't know 
that any of them have ever suggested that the Earth, together 
with all the planets and moons 
of the Solar System, might 
be . . ." 

In a whisper, Frieda finished 
for him, "... a camouflaged fleet 
of gigantic spherical spaceships." 

"your guess happens to be the 
precise truth." 

At that familiar, yet dreadly 
unfamiliar voice, all four of them 
swung toward the inner door. 
Dotty was standing there, a sleepstupefied little girl with a blanket 



caught up around her and dragging behind. Their own daughter. 
But in her eyes was a look from 
which they cringed. 

She said, "I am a creature 
somewhat older than what your 
geologists call the Archeozoic Era. 
I am speaking to you through a 
number of telepathically sensitive 
individuals among your kind. In 
each case my thoughts suit themselves to your level of comprehension. I inhabit the disguised 
and jetless spaceship which is 
your Earth." 

Celeste swayed a step forward. 
"Baby . . ." she implored. 

Dotty went on, without giving 
her a glance, "It is true that we 
planted the seeds of life on some 
of these planets simply as part 
of our camouflage, just as we gave 
them a suitable environment for 
each. And it is true that now 
we must let most of that life be 
destroyed. Our hiding place has 
been discovered, our pursuers are 
upon us, and we must make one 
last effort to escape or do battle, 
since we firmly believe that the 
principle of mental privacy to 
which we have devoted our existence is perhaps the greatest good 
in the whole Universe. 

"But it is not true that we look 
with contempt upon you. Our 
whole race is deeply devoted to 
life, wherever it may come into 
being, and it is our rule never to 
interfere with its development

That was one of the reasons we 
made life a part of our camouflage — it would make our pursuers reluctant to examine these 
planets too closely. 

"Yes, we have always cherished 
you and watched your evolution 
with interest from our hidden 
lairs. We may even unconsciously 
have shaped your development in 
certain ways, trying constantly to 
educate you away from war and 
finally succeeding — which may 
have given the betraying clue to 
our pursuers. 

"Your planets must be burst 
asunder — this particular planet in 
the area of the Pacific — so that 
we may have our last chance to 
escape. Even if we did not move, 
our pursuers would destroy you 
with us. We cannot invite you 
inside our ships — not for lack 
of space, but because you could 
never survive the vast accelerations to which you would be subjected. You would, you see, need 
very special accommodations, of 
which we have enough only for 
a few. 

"Those few we will take with 
us, as the seed from which a new 
human race may — if we ourselves 
somehow survive — be born." 

TJOSALIND and Ivan stared 
dumbly at each other across 
the egg-shaped silver room, without apparent entrance or exit, in 
which they were sprawled. But' 



their thoughts were no longer of 
thirty-odd mile journeys down, 
through solid earth, or of how 
cool it was after the heat of the 
passage, or of how grotesque it 
was to be trapped here, the fragment of a marriage. They were 
both listening to the voice that 
spoke inside their minds. 

"In a few minutes your bodies 
will be separated into layers one 
atom thick, capable of being 
shelved or stored in such a way 
as to endure almost infinite accelerations. Single cells wilt cover 
acres of space. But do not be 
alarmed. The process will be 
painless and each particle will 
be catalogued for future assembly. Your consciousness will endure throughout the process." 

Celeste looked at her goldshod toes. She was wondering, 
wilt they go first, or my head? 
Or will I be peeled like an apple? 

She looked at Ivan and knew 
he was thinking the same thing. 

T TP in the committee room, the 
^ other Wolvers slumped 
around the table. Only little 
Dotty sat straight and staring, 
speechless and unanswering, 
quite beyond their reach, like a 
telephone off the hook and with 
the connection open, but no voice 
from the other end. 

They had just switched off the 
TV after listening to a confused 
medley of denials, prayers, Kom


D 8 . KOMETEVSKY'S DAY 



ctevskyite chatterings, and a few 
'astonishingly realistic comments 
on the possibility of survival. 

These last pointed out that, on 
the side of the Earth opposite 
the Pacific, the convulsions would 
come slowly when the entombed 
spaceship burst forth — provided, 
as seemed the case, that it moved 
without jets or reaction. 

It would be as if the Earth's 
vast core simply vanished. Gravity would diminish abruptly to 
a fraction of its former value. The 
empty envelope of rock and water 
and air would slowly fall together, though at the same time 
the air would begin to escape 
from the debris because there 
would no longer be the" mass required to hold it. 

However, there might be definite chances of temporary apd 
cvf;n prolonged survival for individuals in strong, hermetically 
sealed structures, such as submarines and spaceships. The few 
spaceships on Earth were reported to have blasted off, or be 
preparing to leave, with as many 
passengers as could be carried. 

But most persons, apparently, 
could not contemplate action of 
any sort. They could only sit and 
think, like the Wolvers. 

A faint smile relaxed Celeste's 
face. She was thinking, how beautiful! It means the death of the 
Solar System, which is a horrifying subjective concept. Objec


tively, though, it would be a more 
awesome sight than any human 
being has ever seen or ever could 
see. It's an absurd and even brutal 
thing to wish — but I wish I could 
see the whole cataclysm from beginning to end. It would make 
death seem very small, a tiny 
personal event. 

Dotty's face was losing its 
blank expression, becoming intent and alarmed. 

"We are in contact with our 
pursuers," she said in the familiar-unfamiliar voice. "Negotiations are now going on. There 
seems to be — there is a change in 
them. Where they were harsh and 
vindictive before, they now are 
gentle and conciliatory." She 
paused, the alarm on her childish 
features pinching into anxious 
uncertainty. "Our pursuers have 
always been shrewd. The change 
in them may be false, intended 
merely to lull us into allowing 
them to come close enough to destroy us. We must not fall into 
the trap by growing hopeful ..." 

They leaned forward, clutching 
hands, watching the little face as 
though it were a television screen. 
Celeste had the wild feeling that 
she was listening to a communique from a war so unthinkably 
vast and violent, between opponents so astronomically huge 
and nearly immortal, that she 
felt like no more than a reasoning 
ameba . . . and then realized with 



to 




 



an explosive urge to laugh that 
that was exactly the situation. 

"No!" said Dotty. Her eyes began to glow. "They have changed! 
During the cons in which we lay 
sealed away and hidden from 
them, knowing nothing of them, 
they have rebelled against the 
tyranny of a communal mind to 
which no thoughts are private 
. . . the tyranny that we ourselves 
fled to escape. They come not to 
destroy us, but to welcome us 
back to a society that we and 
they can make truly great!'* 

TT^RIEDA collapsed to a chair, 
•■- trembling between laughter 
and hysterical weeping. Theodor 
looked as blank as Dotty had 
while waiting for words to speak. 
Edmund sprang to the picture 
window. Celeste toward the TV 
set. 

Climbing shakily out of the 
chair, Frieda stumbled to the picture window and peered out beside Edmund. She saw lights bobbing along the paths with a wild 
excitement. 

On the TV screen, Celeste 
watched two brightly lit ships 
spinning in the sky — whether 
human spaceships or Phobos and 
Deimos come to help Earth rejoice, she couldn't tell. 

Dotty spoke again, the joy in 
her strange voice forcing them 
to turn. "And you. dear children, 
creatures of our camouflage, we 



welcome you — whatever your future career on these planets or 
like ones — into the society of enlightened worlds! You need not 
feel small and alone and helpless 
ever again, for we shall always 
be with you!" 

The outer door opened. Ivan 
and Rosalind reeled in, drunkenly 
smiling, arm in arm. 

"Like rockets." Rosalind 
blurted happily. "We came 
through the durasphere and solid 
rock . . . shot up right to the 
surface." 

"They didn't have to take us 
along," Ivan added with a bleary 
grin. "But you know that already, 
don't you? They're too good to 
let you live in fear, so they must 
have told you by now." 

"Yes, we know," said Theodor. 
"They must be almost godlike in 
their goodness. I feel . . . calm." 

Edmund nodded soberly. 
"Calmer than I ever felt before. 
It's knowing. I suppose, that — 
well, we're not alone." 

Dotty blinked and looked 
around and smiled at thena all 
with a wholly little-girl smile-. 

"Oh, Mummy," she said, and 
it was impossible to tell whether 
she spoke to Frieda or Rosalind 
or Celeste, "I've just had the 
funniest dream." 

"No, darling," said Rosalind 
gently, "it's we who had the 
dream. We've just awakened,."
