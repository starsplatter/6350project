the demolished man By ALFRED BESTER 


VII 

AT 12:30 a. m .. the Emergency Patrol arrived at 
/ > Beaumont House in response to precinct notification: 
"GZ. Beaumont. YLP-R" which, 
translated, meant : "An act or 
omission forbidden by law has 
been reported at Beaumont 
House, 9 Park South." 

At 12:50, the Panty Pickups 
arrived in response to an anonymous call: "Get up to The Gilt 



>«4 




 



Corpse. Man dead in a brawl." 
They were summarily ejected by 
the police and hung hopefully 
around |he house. 

At 1 :D0 A. M., Preston Powell 
arrived at Beaumont House in 
response to a frantic call from a 
deputy inspector: "I tell you, 
Powell, it's Felony Tripte-A! I 
don't know whether to be grateor scared; but I know none of 
is equipped to handle it." 
"What can't you handle?" 
* "Look here, Powell. Murder's 
.abnormal. Only a distorted 
^Thought Pattern can produce 
[death by violence. Right?" 
} . "Yes." 

i "Which is why there hasn't 
been a successful Triple-A in 
■over seventy years. A man can't 
walk around with a distorted pattern, hatching murder. You peepers always pick 'em up before they 
Ko into action." 

I "So far," agreed Powell. "Now 
Siere's a killing that must have 
been carefully planned . . . and 
the killer was never noticed, even 
by Maria Beaumont's peeper 
secretaries. That means there 
couldn't have been anything to 
itice. He must have a passable 
attern and yet be abnormal 
ough to murder. How the hell 
we resolve a paradox like 
at?" 

'No idea yet. Any prospects?" 

"Nothing but inconsistencies, 
s don't know what killed 
Courtney; his daughter's dis


appeared ; somebody robbed 

D'Courtney's guards of one 

and we can't figure how. And 

besides — " 

"Don't go any further. I'll be 
right over." 

The great hall of Beaumont 
House blazed with harsh white 
ligh t Uni formed police were 
everywhere. The white-smocked 
technicians from Lab were scurrying like beetles. Four Moltecs, 
glittering snails of coils and glowing tubes, clucked fussily over 
the floors, nursed by Moltec 
squads who worked with the 
drilled precision of eclipse camera 
crews. In the center of the hall, 
the party guests were assembled. 

As Powell came down the east 
ramp, he felt the wave of hostility 
that greeted him. He telepathed 
quickly to Charley $$on, Police 
Inspector 2: "What's the situation, Chas?" 

"Scramble." 

Switching to their informal palice code of scrambled images, 
reversed meanings and personal 
symbols, $$on continued; "Peepers here. Play it safe." He brought 
Powell up to date. 

"/ see. Nasty. What's everybody 
doing lumped out on the Hoot? 
You staging something?" 

"The villain-friend act." 

"Necessary?" 

"It's a rotten crowd. Pampered, 
You'll have to do some tricky 
coaxing to get anything out of 
them, ril be the villain; you b+

their friend, of course." 

"Right. Start recording."' 

Halfway down the ramp, Powell halted. An expression of 
shocked indignation appeared on 
his face. 

"$$son!" he snapped. Every eye 
turned to him. 

Inspector $$on faced Powell. 
In a brutal voice, he said: "Here, 
sir." 

"Is this your concept of the 
proper conduct of an investigation? To herd a group of innocent 
people together like cattle?" 

"They're not innocent," $$on 
growled. ''A man's been killed." 

"$$on, they will be presumed 
to be innocent and treated with 
every courtesy until the murderer 
is uncovered." 

"What?" $$on sneered. "This 
rotten, lousy, high-society pack 
of hyenas — " 

"How dare you! Apologize at 
once!" 

$$on took a deep breath and 
clenched his fists angrily, then 
turned to the staring guests. "My 
apologies," he grumbled. 

"And I'm warning you, $$on," 
Powell snapped, "if anything like 
this happens again, I'll break you. 
Now get out of my sight." 

Powell descended to the floor 
of the hall and smiled at the 
guests. "Ladies and gentlemen, of 
course I know you all by sight. 
I'm not that famous, so let me 
introduce myself. Preston Powell, 
Prefect of the Psychotic Division. 



Two antiquated titles, eh? Prefect and Psychotic. We won't let 
them bother us." He advanced toward Maria Beaumont with hand 
outstretched. "You've had a trying time, I know. These boors in 
uniform." 

A pleased rustle ran through the 
guests. The glowering hostility 
began to fade. Maria took Powell's hand dazedly, mechanically 
beginning to preen herself. 

"Dear Prefect ..." She was 
an aging little girl, clinging to 
his arm. "I've been so terrified." 

Powell snapped his fingers behind him. To the captain who 
stepped forward, he said : "Conduct Madame and her guests to 
the study. No guards." 

The captain cleared his throat. 
"About Madame's guests. One 
of them arrived after the felony 
was reported. An attorney, Mr. 
Jordan." 

Powell found Sam Jordan, Attorney-At-Law 2, in the crowd, 
and telepathed to him. 

"What brought you here, 
Sam?" 

"Business. Called by my 
cli(Ben Reich)ent." 

"That shark. Wait here with 
Reich. Well get squared off." 

"That was an effective act with 
$$on." 

"Hell. You crack out scramble?" 

"Not a chance. But I know you 
two. Gentle Chas playing a bully 
is one for the books."

$$on broke in from across the 
hall where he was apparently 
■ulking: "Don't blow it, Sam." 

"Are you crazy?" At the suggestion that Jordan might smash 
the most sacred ethic of the 
Guild, he radiated a blast of indignation that made $$on grin. 

All this in the second while 
Powell kissed Maria's brow with 
chaste devotion and gently disengaged himself from her tremulous 
grasp. 

"Ladies and gentlemen — to the 
■tudy, please." 

The crowd of guests moved 
off, conducted by the captain. 
They were chattering with renewed animation. Through the 
buzz and the laughter, Powell felt 
the iron elbows of a rigid telepathic block. He recognized those 
elbows and permitted his astonishment to show. 

"Gin! Gus TZr 

"Oh. Hello, Powell" 

"You? Lurking & Slinking?" 

"Gus?" $$on popped out. 
""Here? I never tagged him.** 

"What the devil are you hiding 
lor?" 

Chaotic response of anger, chagrin, fear of lost reputation, selfdeprecation, shame— 

"Ease off, Gus. Won'f do you 
any harm to let a little scandal 
rub off on you. Make you more 
human. Stay here & help. Got a 
hunch I can use another 1st This 
one is going to be a Triple-A 
mtinker" 



A FTER the hall was cleared of 
guests, Powell examined the 
three men who remained with 
him. Sam Jordan was a heavy-set 
man, thick, solid, with a shining 
bald head and a friendly bluntfeatured face. Little T8 was nervous and twitchy . . . more so 
than usual. Too bad the plastic 
surgeons couldn't add six inches 
to his height. Would solve a lot 
of T8's psychological problems. 

And the notorious Ben Reich. 
Powell inspected him for the first 
time. Tall, broad-shouldered, determined, exuding a tremendous 
aura of charm and power. There 
was kindliness in that power, but 
it was corroded by the habit of 
tyranny. Reich's eyes were fine 
and keen, but his mouth was too 
small and sensitive and looked 
oddly like a scar. A magnetic 
man, with something about him 
that was repelling. 

Reich smiled. Spontaneously, 
they shook hands. 

"Do you take everybody off 
guard like this, Reich?" 

"The secret of my success," 
Reich grinned. 

An unexpected chemotropism 
was drawing them together. It 
was dangerous. Powell tried to 
shake it off. 

He turned to Jordan: "Now 
then, Sam?" 

"Reich called me in to represent him and all the other suspects. No telepathy, Pres. This 
has got to stay on the objective 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



level. I'm here to see' that it does. 
I'll have to be present at every 
examination." 

"You can't stop peeping, Sam. 
You've got no legal right. We can 
dig out all we can — " 

"Provided it's with the consent 
of the examinee. I'm here to tell 
you whether you've got that consent or not." 

Powell looked at Reich. "You 
understand your legal rights and 
duties?" 

"Vaguely." 

"Vaguely?" Powell smiled. "I'm 
supposed to believe that from the 
Shark of Sacrament?" 

"Sometimes the shark plays 
possum. This is one of those 
times." 

"Well, I'll lay it out for you. 
Every man has the right to refuse 
telepathic examination . . . just as 
he has the right to refuse oral 
interrogation." 

"We've still got the Fifth 
Amendment," Jordan said. 

Powell nodded. "But the law 
holds that you can't answer some 
questions and refuse to answer 
others. It's got to be all or none." 

"I understand," said Reich. 

"Of course, if you stand on the 
Fifth Amendment in a Triple-A 
Felony and refuse to answer any 
questions in any manner, you 
force us to draw the conclusion 
that you have guilt to conceal." 

"You're not required to respond 
to that," Jordan cut in. 

"I was going to ask about the 



peeping," Reich said. 

"Well," Powell replied, "if you 
decide to open the door, you've 
got to answer all questions, but 
you don't have to submit to telepathic examination. That's optional. Oral replies will satisfy the 
law." 

"In fact," Jordan added, "the 
law requires the police examiner 
to request permission for a TP 
probe on each separate question. 
If you refuse permission, I'm here 
to make it stick. You don't have 
to confide anything in me. You 
tell me you don't want to be 
peeped and I'll see to it that 
you're not. I don't have to know 
what's in your mind to do that." 

"Of course," Powell said pleasantly, "there are many questions you can't possibly object to 
being peeped on. For instance, 
if I asked you what you had for 
dinner tonight ..." 

"He'd have every right in the 
world to refuse telepathic examination on that point." 

Powell turned to Reich. "Want 
it that way?" 

Reich nodded. 

"Sam's a 2nd. I'm a 1st. I can 

pull slick stuff on him. Want to 
wait until you can get hold of 
another 1st to represent you? Ifs 
your right." 

"No," Reich said slowly. "I 
trust Jordan. I. trust you. I don't 
think he'll let you pull any stuff 
on him. I don't think you'll try." 

"Thanks. What was the idea

of getting a lawyer so fast? Are 
you mixed up in this mess?" 

"You don't run Sacrament 
without building up a stockpile 
of secrets that have got to be 
protected." 

"Why should Jordan represent 
the other guests?" 

"Get out of there, Pres." 

"Stop throwing blocks, I'm just 
trying to get his general emotional 
response to the rest of the suspects." 

"You've got no right to get it 
that way." 

"The hell I haven't That one 
was decided by the Carmody 
Case twenty-five years ago. We 
can build up the general background so long as we dont look 
for specific data." 

"Yes, provided the oral question clearly indicates the purpose 
and scope of the peeping. Yours 
did nothing of the kind." 

"I'll rephrase the question." 
Powell said, before Reich could 
answer. "Did you feel that any 
or all of the other guests particularly required the services of Mr. 
Jordan, a leading Esper Attorney? I'd like to peep your answer 
on that for your general emotional response." 

"You don't have to give permission," Jordan said. 

"I won't," Reich replied. 

"Will you give me an oral 
answer?" 

"I will," Reich said. "They 
were all scared. Maria was pet


rified. She begged me to help. 
This was the best I could do." 

"Would you care to tell me 
why you refused to be peeped on 
that answer?" 

"Don't even bother," Jordan 
advised. "Fres has no right to 
ask that. No one has. The Matter 
of the Estate of Alan Courtney 
settled that." 

"Hell," Powell said ruefully. 
"You've stopped me. Let's start 
the investigation." 

They turned and walked toward the study. Across the hall, 
$$on scrambled and asked : "Pres, 
why'd you let Sam tie you in 
legal knots?" 

"While he was busy tying the 
legal *knots, 1 got the one thing 
I was after." 

"What was that?" 

"An answer on the record from 
Ben Reich. He's opened the door, 
Chas. He can't dose it any more." 1 

There was a moment of stunned 
silence, and then, as Powell went 
through the North arch to the 
study, a broadcast of fervent admiration followed him: "I bow, 
Pres. I bow to the Master." 

THE "study" of Beaumont 
House was constructed on the 
lines of a Turkish Bath. The floor 
was a mosaic of jacinth, spinel 
and sunstone. The walls, crosshatched with gold wire cloisonne, 
were glittering with inset synthetic stones . . . ruby, emerald, 
garnet, chrysolite, amethyst, to


THE DIMOMSHID MAN 



pa? ... all containing various 
portraits of the owner. There were 
scatter rugs of brocatelle, and 
scores of chairs and lounges. 

Powell entered the room and 
walk-d directly to the center, 
leaving Reich, T8 and Jordan behind them. He looked around 
him, accurately gauging the mi« 
psyche of these sybarites, and 
meisiKing the tactics he would 
havt- to use. 

He lit a cigarette. "You all 
know, of course, that I'm a peeper. 
Probably this fact has alarmed 
some of you. You imagine that 
I'm standing here like some fabulous monster, probing your 
mental plumbing. Well, Jordan 
wouldn't let me if I could. And, 
frankly, mass peeping is a trick 
no Esper can perform. It's difficult enough to probe a single individual. It's impossible when 
dozens of Telepathic Patterns are 
confuting the picture. And when 
a group of unique, highly individual people like yourselves is gathered, we find ourselves completely 
at your mercy." 

"And lie said / had charm," 
Reich muttered. 

"Tonight," Powell went on, 
"you were playing a delightful 
ancient game called 'Sardine.* I 
wish I had been invited, Madame. 
You must remember me next 
time ..." 

"I will,** Maria promised. "I 
will, dear Prefect." 

"In the course of that game, 



old D'Courtney was killed. We*re 
almost positive it was premeditated murder. We'll be certain 
after Lab has finished its work. 
But let's assume that it is a 
Triple-A Felony. That will enable 
us to play another ancient game 
called 'Murder.' " 

There was an interested response from the guests, Powell 
continued on the same casual 
course, carefully turning the most 
shocking crime in seventy yean 
into a morsel of amusement. 

"In the game of 'Murder.' " he 
said, "a make-believe victim is 
killed. A make-believe detective 
must discover who killed the victim. He asks questions of the 
make-believe suspects. Everyone 
must tell the truth except the 
killer, who is permitted to lie. The 
detective compares stories, deduces who is lying, and uncovers 
the killer. I thought you might 
enjoy playing this game." 

A voice asked, "How?" 

Another added. "I'm just one 
of the tourists." 

"A murder investigation," Powell smiled, "explores three facets 
of a crime. First, the motive. Second, the method. Third, the opportunity. Our Lab people are 
taking care of the second and 
third. The first we can discover 
in our game. If we do, we'll be 
able to crack the other two problems that have Lab stumped now. 
Did you know that they can't 
figure out what killed D'Court

ney? Did you know Jhat D'Courtney's daughter has disappeared? 
She left the house while you 
were playing 'Sardine.' Did you 
know that D'Courtney's guards 
were mysteriously short-circuited? Somebody robbed them 
of a full hour in time. We'd all 
like to know how." 

They were hanging at the very 
edge of the trap, fereathless, fascinated. It had to be sprung with 
infinite caution. 

"Death, disappearance, and 
subjective time machines . . . 
we can find out all about them 
through motive. I'll be the make


believe detective; youll be the 
make-believe suspects. You'll tell 
me the truth ... all except the 
killer, of course. We'll expect him 
to He. But we'll trap him and 
bring this party to a triumphant 
finish if you'll give me permission 
to make a telepathic examination 
of each of you." 

"Oh! M cried Maria in alarm. 

"Wait* Madame. All I want ia 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

your permission. I won't have to 
peep. Because, you see, if all 
the innocent suspects grant permission, then the one who refuses 
must be guilty." 

"Can he pull that?" Reich 
whispered to Jordan. 

Jordan nodded. 

"Just picture the scene for a 
moment." Powell was building 
the drama for them, turning the 
room into a stage. "I ask formally: 'Will you permit me to 
make a TP examination?* Then 
I go around this room." He began 
a slow circuit, bowing to each 
of the guests in turn. "And the 
answers come : 'Yes. Yes. Of 
course. Why not?' And then suddenly a dramatic pause." Powell 
stopped before Reich, erect, terrifying. " 'You, sir,' I repeat. *Will 
you give me your permission to 
peep?* " 

They all watched, hypnotized. 
Even Reich was aghast, transfixed by the pointing finger and 
the fierce scowl. 

"Hesitation. His face flushes 
red, then ghastly white as the 
blood drains out. You hear 1 '' the 
tortured refusal: 'No!'" The Prefect turned and enveloped them 
all with an etcctrifying gesture: 
"And in that thrilling moment, 
we know we have captured the 
killer!" 

He almost had them. Almost. 
But Tom Moyse had bastardy 
ir his soul; Gloria Blomefield, Jr., 
had adultery in her soul ; Tony 



Asj had shame in her soul; Nick 
Boutman had perjury in his soul. 

"No!" Maria cried. They all 
shot to their feet and shouted: 
"No! No!" 

"/( was a beautiful try, Pres, 
but there's your answer." 

Powell was still charming in 
defeat. "I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but I really can't blame 
you. Only a fool would trust a 
cop." He sighed. "One of my 
assistants will tape the oral statements from those of you who care 
to make statements. Mr. Jordan 
will be on hand to advise and 
protect you." He glanced dolefully at Jordan. "And louse me." 

"Don't pull at my heart-strings 
like that, you faker. This is the 
best Triple-A in seventy years. 
My big chance. Are you going to 
sob me out of it?" 

"Hell." Powell said. He winked 
at Reich and left the room. 

LAB was finished in the lavish 
orchid Wedding Suite. Kr^t, 
abrupt, testy, harrassed, handed 
Powell the reports and said, "This 
is a lousy assignment!" 

Powell looked down at 
D'Courtney's body. "Suicide?" 
he snapped. He was always peppery with Kr]/$t, who was comfortable with no other relationship. 

"Not a chance. No weapon." 

"What killed him?" 

"We don't know." 

"Why, he's got a hole in his 



1 10 




 



head you could jet through to the 
Moon !" 

"Entry above the uvula. Exit 
below the fontanelle. Death instantaneous. But what drilled the 
hole through his skull? We don't 
know!" 

"Hard ray?" 

"No burn." 

"Crystalization?" 

"No freeze." 

"Nitro vapor charge?" 

"No ammonia residue." 

"Acid?" 

"Acid spray couldn't burst the 
back of his skull like that." 

"A dirk or a knife?" 

"Impossible. Have you any 
idea how much force is necessary 
to penetrate like this? Couldn't 
be done." 

"Well, I've just about exhausted penetrating weapons. No, 
wait. What about a projectile?" 

"Not a chance here. There's 
no projectile. None in the wound. 
None in the room." 

"Damnation!" 

"I agree." 

"Have you got anything for 
me? Anything at all?" 

"Yes. He was eating candy before his death. Found a fragment 
of gel in his mouth . . . bit of 
standard candy wrapping." 

"And?" 

"No candy in the suite." 
"He might have eaten it all.** 
"No candy in his stomach. 

Anyway, he wouldn't be eating 

candy with that throat." 



"Why not?" 

"Psychogenic cancer. Bad. He 
couldn't talk, let alone eat 
candy." 

"Hell and damnation. We need 
that weapon, whatever it is.** 

"Go find the daughter," Kri/^t 
said. "I'm telling,, you she's got 
it. She popped the old man and 
blew out of here with it." 

"You mean to tell me she went 
to all this trouble? Waited until 
they were visiting? Waited until 
the middle of the night? Then 
killed him this biza.rre way? Tell 
me why." 

"I can't tell you why she killed 
him," Kr^t said with frantic 
calm. "I can't tell you how she 
killed him." Suddenly he burst 
out: "I can't even tell time! Powell, I resign." 

Which made Kr^t's seventeenth resignation in two years. 
Ignoring it, Powell fingered the 
sheaf of reports, staring at the 
waxen body, whistling a crooked 
tune. He remembered reading a 
romance once about an Esper 
who could read a corpse . . . like 
that old myth about photographing the retina of a dead eye. He 
wished it could be done. 

"Well," he sighed at last, "they 
licked us on motive, and they've 
licked us on method. Let's hope 
the Moltec crew can give us something on opportunity, Kr^t, or 
we'll never bring Reich down." 

"Reich? Ben Reich? What 
about him?" 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



III 



"It's Gus T8 I'm worried about 
most," Powell murmured. "If 
he's mixed up in this . . . What? 
Oh, Reich? He's the killer, Kr^t. 
I slicked Sam Jordan down in 
Maria Beaumont's study. Staged 
an act and misdirected Sam while 
I peeped his client. This an off 
the record, of course, but I got 
enough to convince me Reich's 
our man." 

"You did?" Kr%t exclaimed. 

"But that's a long way from 
Demolition, brother. A long. long 
way." * 

Moodily, Powell took leave of 
the Lab Chief, loafed through the 
anteroom and descended to field 
headquarters in the picture gallery, 

"And I like Reich," he muttered. 

HpHE Moltec (Molecular Distortion Detector) was simply 
a mechanical bloodhound. In the 
XXth Century, when explosive 
firearms were in use, it was the 
custom of malefactors to destroy 
the identifying numbers on their 
weapons with file and acid. They 
were unaware that the blow of 
the too! which punched the numbers into the weapon so altered 
the molecular structure of the 
metal that the figures could be 
detected by X-ray and other 
methods after the surface had 
been obliterated. 

The Moltec operated similarly. 
You might walk carefully across 



a floor, with dry feet, sweeping; 
away all footprints, leaving no 
visible train — unaware that your 
step left an unmistakable and 
characteristic molecular stress 
trail. This trail the Moltec followed, crawling over floor, ramp 
and stairs, clucking and buzzing 
mononraniacally. 

The trail was printed in tiny 
arrows on a gridded scald map 
of transparent plastic film, 
printed in a separate color for 
each suspect. When the investiga tion was completed, the transparencies were stacked one on top 
of the other, and when you looked 
down into the pile you saw at a 
glance all the twisting, turning 
human paths, 

$$on set the packed charts before Powell, who examined the 
twining colored threads for a 
moment and then looked up 
wearily. 

"/ know, Pres. It would have 
been easier if they hadn't spotted 
D' Courtney's blood dripping 
through the floor. But when they 
all tore up there in a posse, that 
loused us." 

Powell inspected the collective 
map again. Threads of color wandered through the great hall of 
Beaumont House, the music 
room, the study, the stage, the 
fountains, and finally into the 
Panty Projection Room. From 
there a thick river of prismatic 
color streamed back through 
the hall, up the stairs, through the 



III 




 



picture gallery into the Wedding 
Suite. 

"There's the girl." $$on indicated a yellow trail of arrows 
that started in one of the bedrooms of the Wedding Suite, 
came down the corridor, entered 
the orchid room, and, after a few 
confused circles, left the room and 
led straight through the house to 
the street. 

Powell and $$on began the 
lightning exchanges that characterized peeper conversations: 

"Who's this, Chas? The peachand-emerald colored trails. They 
left the house too." 

"Couple of guests who couldn't 
stomach that Sardine game, bless 
'em. Left early. One is a psychsong-writer named Duffy Wyg&. 
The other's Wally Chervil's boy. 
Young Galen" 

"Oops." 

"No, he's in the right orbit. 
Pres. He doesn't belong to Beaumont's Carnal Circle. I got it 
straight from the peeper secretaries. Gaily crashed the party on 
a bet. Apparently he couldn't jet 
out fast enough." 

"Pick 'em up anyway and have 
a talk, Charley." 

"In the works." 

"Right. Which trail is Reich's?" 

"Why Reich in particular? 
What? Him?" 

"Uh-huh." 

"My God. 1 What it must be 
tike to be a 1st." 

"Take your Guild exams and 



find out Which is Reich?" 

"Took 'em again last month. 
Failed again. Reich is the scarlet 
trail." 

"Thought so. Look at it, Chas. 
Reich went up to the orchid suite 
twice and came down twice. See 
that?" 

"Yep. And?" 

"That could be opportunity. 
He went up once with the posse; 
but he went up once before to 
kill D'Courtney" 

"You'll never prove it. Pres." 

"Can the guards help?" 

"Nope. They've lost one solid 
hour. Kri.At says their retinal 
rhodopsin was destroyed. That's 
the visual purple . . . what you 
see with. As far as the guards 
are concerned, they were on duty 
and alert. Nothing happened until the mob suddenly appeared 
and Maria was screeching at them 
for falling asleep on the job . . . 
which they swear they did not." 

"But we know it was Reich.'* 

"You know it was Reich. Nobody else does." 

"He went up there while th$ 
guests were playing the Sardine 
game. He kerflumoxed the guards'

why?"

*'I don't know any of the answers . . . yet." 

"You'll never get a Demolition 
that way." 

"That I do know." 

"You've got to show motive, 
method and opportunity, objectively. The Moitec evidence won't 
stand up alone. It'll need powerful supporting evidence. All 
you've got is a peeper's knowledge 
that it was Reich who killed 
D' Courtney ." 

"Uh-huh." 

"Did you peep how or why?" 

*'Couldn't get in deep enough 
, . . not with Sam Jordan watching me." 

"And you'll probably never get 
in. Sam's too careful." 

"Damnation! Charley, we need 
the girl" 

"Barbara D'Courtney?" 

"Yes. She's the key. If she can 
tell us what she saw and why 
she ran, we'll satisfy a court. Collate everything we've got so far 
{which is practically nothing} 
and file it. It won't do us any 
good without the girl. Let everyone go. We'll have to backtrack 
on Reich . „ . see what collateral 
evidence we can dig up, but — *' 

"But it won't help without that 
goddam girl." 

"Times like this, Charley, I 
hate women. For Christ's sake, 
why are they all trying to get 
me married."

TJAVING had the last word, 
Powell got to his feet and 
left the picture gallery. He crossed 
the overpass, descended to the 
music room and entered the main 
hall. He saw Reich, Jordan and 
T8 talking intently alongside the 
fountain. Once again he fretted 
over the frightening problem of 
T8. If the little peeper really was 
mixed up with Reich, as Powell 
had sensed at the party last week, 
he might be mixed up in this 
killing. 

The idea of a 1st class Esper, 
a pillar of the Guild, participating in murder was unthinkable; 
and, if actually fact, hell to prove. 
Nobody ever got anything from 
a 1st without full consent. And 
if T8 was (incredibly, impossibly, 
100-1 against) working with 
Reich, Reich himself might prove 
impregnable. 

Resolving on one last propaganda attack before he was forced 
to resort to police work, Powell 
caught their eyes, and directed a 
quick command to the peepers: 
"Sam, Gus — jet. I want to say 
something to Reich I don't want 
you to hear. I won't peep him or 
record his words. That's a 
pledge." 

Jordan and T8 nodded. Reich 
watched them go and then looked 
at Powell. "Scare 'em off?" he 
inquired.

"Warned them off. Sit down, 
Reich." 

They sat on the edge of the 
basin, looking at each other, a 
chemotropic smile on their lips. 
They sat in a warm, friendly silence. 

"No," Powell said after a pause, 
"I'm not peeping you." 

"Didn't think you were. But 
you did in Maria's study, ch?" 

"Felt that?" 

"No. Guessed. It's what I 
would have done." 

"Neither of us is very trustworthy, eh?" 

"It's the cowards and sore 
losers who hide behind fair play." 

"What about honor?" 

"We've got honor in us, but it's 
our own code . . . not makebelieve rules.'' 

Powell shook his head sadly. 
"You're two men, Reich. One of 
them's wonderful; the other's rotten. If you were all killer, it 
wouldn't be so bad. But there's 
half louse and half saint in you, 
end that makes it worse." 

"I knew it was going to be bad 
when you winked." Reich grinned. 
"You really scare me, Powell. I 
never can tell when the punch 
is coming or which way to duck.'* 

"Then, for God's sake, stop 
ducking and get it over with," 
Powell said. His voice burned. 
"I'm going to lick you on this 
one. Ben. I'm going to strangle 
the lousy killer in you, because 
I admire the sainjt. This is the 



beginning of the end for you. You 
know it. Why don't you make it 
easier for yourself?" 

"And give up the best fight of 
my life with the best enemy I 
ever met?" 

Powell shrugged angrily. They 
both arose. Instinctively, their 
hands met in the four-way clasp 
of final farewell. 

"I lost a great partner in you, 
Pres," Reich smiled. 

"You lost a great man in your* 
self, Ben." 

"Enemies?" 

"Enemies."

' I^HE police prefect of a city of 
-1 seventeen and one-half millions cannot be tied down to an 
office. He does not have a desk. 
He does not have files, memoranda, dossiers. He has three Esper secretaries, memory wizards 
all, who carry within their skulls 
the minutiae of his business. They 
accompany him within headquarters like a triple index. Occasionally, one of them joins him on the 
field while the others remain behind to act as his proxy. Surrounded by his flying squad, 
Powell jetted through headquar* 
ters, assembling the material for 
his fight. 

To Commissioner Crabbe he 
laid out the broad outlines once 
more: "We need motive, method 
and opportunity, Commissioner. 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



115 



We've got opportunity, but it 
won't stand alone. Mr. Peetcy'U 
never buy it. It's got to be bolstered by the other two. I'm 
speaking of objective evidence for 
the court. Now, I'm ready to go 
all out on Ben Reich and Sacrament. I want to ask you a straight 
question — are you willing to go 
all out too?" 

Crabbe, who resented Espers, 
turned purple and shot up from 
the ebony chair behind the ebony 
desk in his ebony -and -silver office. "What the hell is that supposed to mean?" 

"Don't sound for undercurrents, sir. I'm merely asking if 
you're tied to Reich and Sacrament in any way. Will it be possible for Reich to come to you 
and ask to have the rockets 
cooled?" > 

"God damn your impudence, 
Powell—" 

"Excuse me, sir, I'm just trying to be realistic. I'm a career 
criminologist. You're a politician. 
Politicians must have support. 
Has Reich been one of your supporters?" 

"No, he's not." 

"Sir: On December fourth last, 
Commissioner Crabbe discussed 
the Langley Case with you. Extract follows: 

Powell: There's a tricky financial angle to this business, Commissioner. 
Sacrament may hold 
us up with a demurrer 



and attempt seizure 

of the Langley assets. 

Crabbe : Reich's given me his 
word he won't; and I 
can always depend on 
Ben Reich. He backed 
me up for County 
Attorney. 

End quote." 

"Right. I thought I was reaching for something." Powell 
dropped his tact and glared at 
Crabbe. "What about your campaign for County D. A.? Reich 
backed you for that, didn't he?" 

"He did." 

"And I'm supposed to believe 
he hasn't continued supporting 
you?" 

"Yes, you are. He backed me 
then. He has not supported me 
since." 

"Then I have the beacon on 
the Reich murder?" 

"Why do you insist that Ben 
Reich killed that man? It's ridiculous. You've got no proof. Your 
own admission." 

"Do I have the beacon on the 
Reich murder?" 

"You do." 

"But with strong reservations. 
Make a note, boys. He's scared 
to death of Reich. Make another 
note. So am I." 

TO his staff, Powell said: "Now 
look, you all know what a 
coldblooded monster Peetcy is. 
I swear he gives me nightmares 
. . . screaming for facts, facts.

We'll have to produce evidence 
to convince.- him he ought to prosecute. To do that, we're going to 
pull the Rough & Smooth on 
Reich." 

"Brief us," $$on said. 

"Go back to your Academy 
training, gentlemen. Remember 
that ancient device for tailing a 
tough subject? Assign a clumsy 
operative and a slick one to the 
subject. The cluck didn't know 
the smoothie was on the job. 
Neither did the subject. After 
he'd shaken the rough tail, he 
imagined he was clear. That made 
it a cinch for the slicker. That's 
what we're going to do to Reich." 

"Check." said $$on. 

"Go through every department. 
Pull out the hundred dumbest 
cops you can locate. Put 'em into 
plainclothes and assign' em to 
Reich. Go up to Lab and get hold 
of every crackpot robot gimmick 
that's been submitted in the last 
ten years. Put all the gadgets to 
work on Reich. Make it a rough 
tail, but the kind he'll have to 
work to shake." 

"Any specific areas?" $$on inquired. 

"All except one. Why were they 
playing 'Sardine? 1 Who suggested 
the game? Beaumont's secretaries 
went on record that Reich 
couldn't be peeped because he 
had a song kicking around in his 
skull. What song? Who wrote it? 
Wherc'd Reich hear it? The 
guards were blasted with some 



kind of Visual Purple Ionizer. 
Check all research on that sort of 
thing. What killed D'Courtney? 
Let's have lots of weapon research. Backtrack on Reich's relations with D'Courtney. What 
and how much does Reich stand 
to win by D'Courtney's death?" 

"All this Rough? We'll louse 
the case, Pres!" 

"Maybe. I don't think so. 
Reich's a successful man. He'll 
imagine he's outsmarting us every 
time he outmaneuvers one of our 
decoys. Keep him thinking that. 
The Pantys'll tear us apart. Play 
along with it. We're all going to 
be blundering, outwitted cops, 
and while Reich's eating himself 
fat on that diet — " 

"You'll be eating Reich," $$on 
grinned. "What about the girl?" 

"She's the one exception to the 
rough routine. We level with her. 
I want a description and photo 
sent to every police officer in the 
county within one hour. On the 
bottom of the stat announce that 
the man who locates her will automatically be jumped five grades." 

"Sir: Regulations forbid e/evotion of more than three ranks." 

"To hell with regulations," 
Powell snapped to his secretary. 
"Five grades to the man who 
finds Barbara D'Courtney. I've 
got to get that girl." 

IN Sacrament Tower, Ben Reich 
shoved every piezo crystal off

of his intimidated secretaries. 

"Get the hell out of here and 
take this with you," he growled. 
"For a while the office coasts 
without me. Understand?" 

"But the Tycho estimates . . ." 

"You people handle it. Submit 
the estimates. Brush off Salzman 
on the City Contract. Remember 
to have Laslow bid on those 
Venus auctions. Send Pickfield 
the Mandamus Writs. Sign the 
shop contracts with Amalgamated 
Brotherhood and don't bother 
me." 

"Mr. Reich, we'd understood 
you were contemplating taking 
over the D'Courtney interests now 
that Craye D'Courtney's dead. 
If you — " 

, "I'm taking care of that right 
now. That's why I don't want 
to be bothered." 

He pushed them out, slammed 
the door and locked it. He went 
to the phone, punched BD-12,232 
and the image of Jeremy Church 
appeared against a background of 
pawnshop, debris. 

"You?" Church snarled. 

"Still interested in reinstatement?" 

Church started. "What about 
it?" 

"You've made yourself a deal. 
I want a lot in return." 

"For God's sake, Ben, anything! Just ask me." 

"Unlimited service. You know 
the price I'm paying. Are you 
selling?" 



"I'm selling, Ben! Yes!" 

"I want that blind son of a 
bitch. The red-headed one." 

"Keno Quizzard? He isn't safe, 
Ben. Nobody gets anything frgm 
Quizzard." 

"Set up a meeting. Same place. 
This is like old times, eh, Jerry? 
Only this time it's going to have 
a happy ending." 

rpHE usual line of applicants 
was assembled in the anteroom of the Esper Guild Institute when Powell entered. The 
hopeful hundreds, all ages, all 
sexes, all classes, dreaming that 
they had the magic power that 
could make life the fulfillment of 
fantasy, unaware of the heavy 
responsibility that power entailed. The repugnant odor of 
those wishes came to Powell from 
the line: Read minds and make 
a killing on the market . . . 
(Guild Law forbade speculation 
or gambling by peepers) . . . 
Read minds and know the answers to all the exam questions 
. . . (That was a schoolboy, unaware that Esper Proctors were 
hired by Examination Boards to 
prevent that kind Of peepercheating) . . . Read minds and 
know what people really think 
of me . . . Read minds and know 
which girls are wilting' . . . 

At the desk, the receptionist 
wearily broadcast on the broadest TP band: "If you can hear 
me, please go through the door

or the left marked Employees 
Only." 

To sn assured young society 
woman with a checkbook in her 
hand, she was saying : "No, 
madam, the Guild does not 
charge for training and instruction, so spend your money on 
something else. We can do nothing for you." 

Deaf to the basic test of the 
Guild, the woman turned away 
angrily. 

li you can hear me, please &o 
through the door on the left . . . 

An elderly Negro suddenly detached himself from the line, 
glanced uncertainly at the receptionist, and then limped to the 
proper door. Powell nodded to 
the receptionist and followed the 
Latent. 

Inside, Jennings and Whitehead were enthusiastically shaking the surprised man's hand and 
patting him on the back. Powell 
joined them for a moment and 
added his congratulations. It was 
always a happy day for the Guild 
when they unearthed another 
Esper. 

Powell walked down the corridor toward the president's suite. 
He passed a kindergarten where 
thirty children and ten adults 
were mixing speech and thought 
in a frightful patternJess stew. 
Their instructor was patiently 
broadcasting: "Think, class. 
Words are not necessary. Remember to break the speech reflex. 



Repeat the first rule after me . . . n 
And the class chanted: "Eliminate the larynx." 

Powell winced and moved on. 
The wall opposite the kindergarten was covered by a gold plaqUC 
on which was engraved the sacred 
words of the Galen Pledge: 

1 will look upon I urn who shall havje 
taught me this art as one of my parents, I will sjiare my substance with

if lie be in need. I will regcrd his

In the lecture hall, a class erf 
3rds was earnestly weaving simple basket patterns while they 
discussed current events. There 
was one little overdue 2nd, a 
twelve-year-old urchin who was 
adding zigzag ad libs to the dull 
discussion and peaking every zig 
with a spoken word. The word* 
rhymed and were barbed comments on the speakers. It was 
very amusing and amazingl> precocious. 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



11? 



Powell halted and, below the 
class threshold, asked the instructor: "Who's rfie infant phenomenon?" 

"Dennis McCaltion." 

"Reported him to the Board 
yet?" 

"Going to send one in today." 

"Well, add a recommendation 
from me. Suggest he be sent directly to an alpha class. tf he 
keeps on like this, he may establish a new peeper rating . . . above 
the lsf." 

Hilf a dozen 2nds were taking 
their exams for advanced rating 
in the seminar room. They were 
clustered around Molly Chindo, 
the anient from Kingston Hospital, chatting, smoking, and uneasily evading Molly's mental 
passes. Molly was still ravishing 
. . . a blue-eyed, black-haired 
nymphomaniac who was also 
oligophrenic. It was a dirty trick 
to introduce the sexual angle and 
confuse the examinees, but a 1st 
rating had to be earned the hard 
way, and Molly was only one 
in a series of severe tests. 

A group of college-age kids was 
loafing outside the president's 
suite, endlessly grousing about 
the endless educational problems 
of the peepers . . . the long hours 
of extra work at the Institute after 
their regular college lectures . . . 
the rigorous code of Guild ethics 
. . . the gloomy aspects of their 
futures, endless work, endless devotion to service . . . 



"Oh, brother! If we could only 
get lost from peeping, how fast 
we'd shake it. Who wants to go 
through life like a walking saint? 
They ought to write an llffi 
Commandment: 'Thou shalt not 
deprive any man of the right to 
go to hell.' " 

They signed off when Powell 
approached. As he entered the 
suite he said: "It isn't so bad. 
You get used to being admirable 
after a while." The spoken words 
shamed them, and a good thing 
too. They were in that stage 
when youngsters resist conditioning. 

That couldn't be encouraged. 

rFiHE president's suite was in an 
uproar. All the office doors 
were open, and clerks and secretaries were scurrying, Old T'sungHsai, the president, a portly 
mandarin with shaven skull and 
benign features, stood in the center of his office and raged. 

"I don't care what the honorable scoundrels call themse lvtfs," 
T'sung Hsai roared. "Talk to me 
about racial purity of the Guild, 
will they? I'll fill their concave 
ears. Miss Prinn!" 

Helen Prinn crept into T-H's 
office. 

"Take a letter to these devils. 
To the League of Esper Patriots. 
Greefings, Powell. Your august 
presence honors these humble 
eyes. My threadbare office is

many-jeweled visage . . . The organized campaign to cut down 
Guild taxation for the education 
of Espers for the benefit of mankind is the action of a nest of 
roaches resisting the sterilization 
of a filthy kitchen. New paragraph . . 

T-H wrenched himself from his 
diatribe and bowed profoundly to 
Powell. "And has a joyous wife 
yet been found to enlarge the tree 
of your celestial family?" 

"Not yet, sir." 

"Damn it, Powell, get married!" T-H bellowed. "I don't 
want to be stuck with this job 
forever. Paragraph, Miss Print! ; 
You speak of the hardships of 
taxation, of preserving the aristocracy of Espers, of the unsuitability of the average man for 
Bsper training. What the hell do 
you want, Powell?" 

"I want to use the grapevine, 
sir." 

"Well, don't bother me. Vve 
got this three-tongued League 
of Lice on my back. Speak to 
Jenny about it. Paragraph, Miss 
Prinn : You parasitic bastards 
want Esper powers turned into a 
monopoly, and no taxation so 
you can keep your loot like the 
corrupt, unashamed leeches you 
are—" 

Powell tactfully closed the door 
and turned to Jenny James, who 
was quaking in a corner. 

"Really scared. Jenny?" 

Image of an eye winking and 



n question mark quaking. 

"When Papa T-H blows hie 
top, we like him to think we're 
petrified. Makes him happier" 

Powell dropped the official police description and portrait of 
Barbara D'Courtney on the secretary's desk. "Here's something 
you can do for me, Jenny." 

"What a beautiful girl!" Jenny 
exclaimed. 

"I want this sent out on the 
grapevine, marked urgent. Pass 
the word that the peeper who locates Barbara D'Courtney for me 
will have his Guild taxes remitted 
for a year." 

"Jeepers!" Jenny sat bolt upright. "Can you do that, PreaP* 

"Council agreed to it." 

"This' If make the grapevine 
jump!" 

**/ want it to jump. I want

QUIZZARD'S casino had been 
cleared and polished during 
the afternoon break . . . the only 
break in the gambler's day. The 
eo and roulette tables were 
brushed, the gold birdcage 
sparkled, the hazard and h<*nk 
crap boards gleamed green and 
white. On the cashier's desk, rold 
sovereigns— the standard coi" of 
gambling and the underworldwere racked in tempting stacks. 
Reich sat at the billiard (genuine 
antique) tabic with Jerry Church

and Keno Quizzard, the blind 
croupier. Quizzar'd was fat with 
flaming red beard, dead-white 
skin and malevolent dead-white 
eyes. 

"Your price," Reich told 
Church, "you know already. And 
I'm warning you, Jerry, don't 
try to peep me. If you get into 
my head you're getting into 
Demolition." 

Quizzard murmured in his 
clabbered blind man's voice: "As 
bad as that? I don't hanker for 
a Demol, Reich." 

"Who does? What do you 
hanker for, Keno?" 

Quizzard reached back and 
with sure fingers pulled a rouleau 
of sovereigns off the desk and 
let them cascade from one hand 
to the other. "Listen to what I 
hanker for." 

"Name the best price you can 
figure, Keno." 

"You got a hundred Ms laying 
around?" 

"Hundred thousand? Right. 
That's the price." 

"For the love of . . . " Church 
popped upright and stared at 
Reich. "A hundred thousand!" 

"Make up your mind, Jerry," 
Reich said. "Do you want money 
or reinstatement?" 

"It's almost worth — No. Am 
I crazy? I'll take reinstatement." 

"Then stop drooling." Reich 
turned to Quizzard. "I know you, 
Keno. You've got an idea you 
can find out what I want and 



then shop around for higher bids. 
I want you committed right now. 
That's why I let you set the 
price." 

"Yeah," Quizzard said slowly. 
"I had that idea, Reich." He 
smiled and the milk-white eyes 
disappeared in folds of skin. "I 
still got that idea." 

"Then I'll tell you right now 
who'll buy from you, A man 
named Preston Powell. I don't 
know what he can pay." 

"Whatever it is, I don't want ,. 
it," Quizzard spat. 
. "I'm still waiting to hear from 
you." 

"I told you it's a deal. I'm 
committed." 

"I don't hear you, Keno." 

"He knows, Jerry?" 

"He knows," Church muttered, 
"He's been around." 

With grudging respect, Quizzard reached into his pocket and 
withdrew his key chain. Reich 
followed suit. The keys were 
small platinum cylinders, radiant 
to operate photo-electric locks, 
but capable if you knew how — ■ 
and the underworld knew how — 
of burning a tiny temporary tattoo into the skin. Reich and Quizzard stripped their arms and each 
tattooed the other above the elbow with the characteristic design of his key. It was the under- < 
world's inviolable contract. A 
thief named Whittmaker had 
once conceived the idea of entering into such a contract for the 



122 




 



purpose of burglary through a 
key duplicated from the tattooed 
design. He failed. It was impossible to duplicate the key. He also 
lost an ear. Plastic surgery had 
no difficulty in duplicating that. 

"All right," Reich said, "now 
listen to this. First job. I want 
a girl. Her name is Barbara 
D' Courtney." 

"The killing?" Quizzard nodded 
heavily. "I thought so." 

"Any objections?" 
> Quizzard jingled gold from one 

hand to the other and shook his 
head. 

"I want the girl. She blew out 
of the Beaumont House last night 
and no one knows where she 
landed. I want her, Keno. Before 
the police get her." 

Quizzard nodded. 

"She's about twenty-five. About 
five-five. Around a hundred and 
twenty pounds. Really stacked." 

The fat lips smiled hungrily. 
The dead-white eyes glistened. 

"Yellow hair. Black eyes. Black 
eyebrows. Heart-shaped face. Full 
mouth and a kind of aquiline 
nose . . . high bridge, sharp nostrils. She's got a face with character," 

"Got the picture. Clothes?" 

"She was wearing a silk dressing gown last time I saw her. 
» Frosty white and translucent . . . 
like a frozen window. No shoes. 
No stockings. No hat. No jewelry. 
She was off her beam enough to 
tear out into the streets and dis


appear. I want her." Something 
compelled Reich to add: "I want 
her undamaged." 

"With her hauling a freight like 
that? Have a heart, Reich." Quizzard licked his fat lips. "You 
don't stand a chance. She don't 
stand a chance." 

"That what a hundred Ms are 
for. I stand a good chance if you 
get her fast enough." 

"I may have to slush for her.** 

"Then slush. Check every 
bawdy house, bagnio, Blind Tiger 
and Frab Joint in the city. 1 want 
the girl. Understand?" 

Quizzard nodded, still jingling 
the gold. "I understand." 

Suddenly Reich reached across 
the table and slashed Quizzard's 
fat hands with the edge of his 
palm. The sovereigns chimed into 
the air. 

"And I don't want any doublecross," Reich growled in a deadly 
voice. "Don't try any."

/~|NE week of attack and defense, lunge andriposte, all 
fought on the surface while, deep 
below the agitated waters, Powell 
and Augustus T8 circled like 
silent sharks awaiting the onset 
of the real war.

rifted friends bellowed: "It was a 
frame. You was in cahoots with 
the killer. You set up the murder. 
That's why you was playin* that 
Sardine game. Go ahead, deny it." 

The Gilt Corpse squawked and 
ran. As Officer Finney set off in 
hot pursuit, he was peeped deeply 
and thoroughly by one of Madam 
Beaumont's friends. 

T8 to Reich: The cop was telling the 
truth. His department believes Maria 
was an accomplice. 

Reich to TS: All right. We'll throw 
her to the wolves. Let the cops have 
her. 

In consequence, Madam Beaumont was left unprotected. She 
took refuge, of all places, in the 
Loan Brokerage that was the 
source of her enormous income. 
Officer Finney located The Gilt 



Corpse there three hours later 
and subjected her to a merciless 
grilling in the office of the peeper 
Credit Supervisor. He was unaware that Preston Powell was 
just outside the office, chatting 
with the Supervisor. 



Powell to staff: She got the game oat 
of a book Reich gave her. Probably 
purchased at Winters. They handle 
that stuff. Pass the word. Did he ask 
for it specifically? Also, check fTt 
the appraiser. How come the only 
intact game in the book was 'Sardine?' Peetcy'Il want to know. And 
where's that girl?

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Dodo Wraught, patrol officer 
now in plainclothes, was going to 
come through on his big chance 
with the suave approach. To the 
manager and staff of Winters, hedrawled : "I'm in the market for 
old game books . . . the kind my 
very good friend, Ben Reich, 
asked for last week." 

T8 «• Reich: IVe been peeping 
■roniid. They're going i<> eheek that 
book ... . tenl Mari». 

Reich in I H : I, .'i 'em. I'm eoveretl. 
I've got to concentrate on that girl. 

The manager and staff carefully explained matters at great 
length in response to Officer 
Wraught's suave questions. Many 
clients lost patience and left the 
store. One sat quietly in a corner, 
too wrapt in a crystal recording 
to realize he was left unattended. 
Nobody knew that Charley $$on 
was completely tone-deaf. 

Pimcll <•> staff: Reich apparent!* 
f. mi ml the book, accidentally. Stumbled 
over it tvhilc he was looking for a 
present for the Beaumont. P»s» the 
word. And where's that jrirl? 

In conference with the agency 
that handled copy for the Sacrament Jumper (the only Nulgee 
Family Air Rocket on the market) Reich came up with a new 
advertising program. 

"You can't sell transportation 
on an efficiency basis," he said. 
"People won't buy our Jumper 
because it's the best piece of ma


chinery for the money. We can 
tell 'em it's more efficient and 
cheaper than the D'Courtney 
product until we're blue in the 
face. It won't do any good. This 
bankbook comparison campaign 
of yours stinks." 

"Granted, Mr. Reich," the account man said alertly. "Its scope 
was out of orbit. Our synthesis 
was faulty." 

"The fact is this." Reich continued. "People always anthropomorphize the products they use. 
They give them pet names and 
treat them like family pets. A 
man won't buy a Jumper if it's 
merely efficient. He wants to love 
it." 

"Check!" the account man 
cried. "Your idea has a sense of 
scope that dwarfs us, Mr. Reich. 
Now we know who we're rooting 
for." 

"We're going to anthropomorphize our Jumper," Reich said. 
"Let's find a girl and vote her 
the Sacrament Jumper Girl. We'll 
make every consumer identify his 
Jumper with this girl. When he 
buys one, he's buying her." 

"Check, Mr. Reich. Check!" 

"Start an immediate campaign 
to locate the Jumper Girl. Get 
every salesman onto it. Comb the 
city. Give it lots of play in the 
Pantys and papers. I want the 
girl to be about twenty-five, fivefive, hundred and twenty pounds. 
Lots of bounce." 

"I understand the psychology.

Girl." 

"She ought to be a blonde with 
dark eyes. Full mouth. Good 
strong nose. I've had one of my 
peeper artists prepare a sketch 
of my idea of the Jumper Girl. 
Look it over, have it reproduced 
and passed out to your crew. 
There's a promotion for the man 
who locates the girl 1 have in 
mind." 

T8 to Iteirh: I've been peeping some 
more. They're sending a man into 
Sacrament to dig up something between miii and that appraiser, fry. 

It<-i. It lo TH: Something between me 
and fri ! Powell couldn't be that 

dumb. < Id he? Maybe I've been 

overrating him. 

Expense was no object to 
Alfred Finely, who believed in the 
disguises of plastic surgery. 
Freshly equipped with Mongoloid 
features, he took a job in Sacrament's accounting department 
and attempted to unearth Reich's 
financial relations with ^ry. It 
never occurred to him that his 
intent had been thoroughly 
peeped by Sacrament's Esper 
Personnel Chief and reported upstairs, and that upstairs was 
quietly chuckling. 

Powell to Itaffl The idiot was looking 
for bribery recorded in Sacrament's 
bookll Tli is should lower Reich's 
opinion of U by fifty per cent; which 
makes him fifty per eent more vulnerable. Where*! that girl? 



At the board meeting of "The 
Hour" (the only round - 1 heclock paper on Earth, twentyfour editions a day) which was 
actually a Sacrament houseorgan, Reich announced a new 
charity to be begun at once and 
publicized immediately. 

"Well call it 'Sanctuary,' " he 
said. "We offer aid to the submerged millions in the world in 
their time of crisis. If you've been 
evicted, bankrupted, terrorized, 
swindled ... if you're frightened 
for any reason and don't know 
where to turn . . . turn to Sanctuary." 

"It's a hell of a promotion,** 
the managing editor said, "but 
it'll cost like crazy. What's it 
for?" 

"Public relations," Reich 
snapped. "The D'Courtney 
crowd's turned itself into the 
Great White Father. It's time 
Sacrament took over the role." 

Reich left the board room, went 
down to the street and located a 
public phone booth. He called 
Ellery West. "I want a man 
placed in every Sanctuary office, 
a full description and photo of 
every applicant relayed to me at 
they come in." 

"I'm not asking any questions, 
Ben, but I wish I could peep you 
on that." 

"Suspicious?" Reich snarled. 

"Just curious." 

"Don't let it kill you." 

As Reich left the booth he wa» 




 



accosted by a mousy man who 
wore an air of inept eagerness. 

"Oh, Mr. Reich. Lucky I 
bumped into you. The word just 
came down about Sanctuary and 
I thought a human interest interview with the originator of that 
wonderful charity might — " 

Lucky he bumped into him! 
The man was Quinn, "The 
Hour's" famous peeper reporter. 
Probably tailed him down and— 
Tenser, said the Tensor. Tenser, 
said the Tensor. Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. 

"Was there ever a time when 
you didn't know where to turn?

or murder? Were — " 

Tenser, said the Tensor. 

Reich dove into a Public 
Jumper and escaped.

Marcus f'ry had left no forwarding address and was pursued 
by Prof. Elias Johnson's "Aural 
Selector" (a mechanical bloodhound responsive to the particular aura surrounding the human 
psyche ) , Dr. E. G. Howard's 
"Probability Prognosticator" (a 
mechanical divinator). and Wm. 
Elgin's "Electrodianetiphore" (a 



mechanical device defying all description). 

The "Aural Selector" ended up 
in Greenland; the "Probability 
Prognosticator" broke down in 
Kimberly; the "Electrodianetiphore" reached Shanghai, and 
Marcus fry arrived in Moscow 
where Powell located him at a 
book auction conducted at breakneck speed by a peeper auctioneer. Powell interviewed fry in 
the foyer before a window overlooking the remains of Red 
Square.

Three operatives in succession 
were smitten with Miss Duffy 
Wyg& and retired in disgrace to 
don their uniforms once more. 
When Powell finally reached her, 
she was at the 4,000 Ball, escorted 
and patrolled by Sam Jordan 
who gave her advice and counsel. 
She elected to talk.

of African Mines, Ltd., a subsidiary of Sacrament, "it's my 
opinion it's a ruse fomented by 
the D'Courtney gang, and I'm 
going to throw tt back in their 
teeth." 

"I must disagree with you, Mr. 
Reich. Our attorney has been conferring with the strike committee. 
He's an Esper, of course. It seems 
that when the labor union negotiated the contract last year, 
they failed to express their demands clearly. That failure was 
b result of their decision not to 
employ Esper counsel for reasons 
of economy ... a decision they 
now regret. That is the issue. I 
hardly think that the D'Courtney 
Cartel is — " 

"You're not paid to think. Just

In response to bitter criticism. 
Commissioner Crabbe revealed 
that Police Laboratories had discovered a new investigation technique which would break the 
D'Courtney Case within 24 hours. 
It involved photomagnetic analysis of the Visual Purple in the 
corpse's eyes which would yield 
a picture of the murderer. 
Rhodopsin researchers were being 
co-opted by the police. 

An anonymous person with a 
clabbered voice phoned Wilson 
J^maine at Central Tech and 
casually attempted to purchase 
Dr. ^maine's interest in the 
Drake Estate for a small sum. 
The clobbered voice sounded too 
crafty to %maine (who had never 
even heard of the Drake Estate) 
and he called Central's Law 
School. He was informed that the 
Drake Estate on Callisto, valued 
at half a million, had just beat 
reopened for litigation. Dr. 
maine was a probable legatee. 
The psychologirt jetted for Callisto one hour later.

was entertaining Reich with her 
squawking flight, a bright young 
attorney from Sacrament's legal 
department was deftly decoyed 
to Paris and held there anonymously on a valid, if antiquated, 
vice charge. An astonishing 
double of that gentleman went to 
work for him. 

TJt In Reich: Check your legal depiiii "out. I can't. peep what's polity 
on, Imi something's fishy. This idangrrous. 

Reich brought in an Esper Efficiency Expert 1, ostensibly for 
a general checkup, and located 
the substitution. Then he called 
the man with the clabbered voice 
who had multifarious connections. A plaintiff suddenly appeared and sued the bright young 
attorney for barratry. That ended 
the substitute's connection with 
Sacrament painlessly and legitimately. 

Powell lo staff : We're being- licked. 
ReicVs slit muring every <loor in our 
face . . . Rough & Smooth. Kind

While Alfred Finely was cavorting around Sacrament with 
his brand-new Mongolian face, 
one of Sacrament's young scientists, who had been badly hurt 
in n laboratory explosion, apparently left the hospital a week 
early and reported back for duty. 
He was heavily bandaged, but 



eager for work. It was the old 

Sacrament spirit. 

T8 lo Reich: I've finally figured it. 
Powell isn't dumb. He's running his 
investigation on two levels. Don't 
pay any attention lo the one that 
whows. Watch out Tor ihe one underneath. I've peeped something about 
it hospital. Cheek it. 

Reich checked. It took three 
days and then he called the man 
with the clabbered voice. Sacrament was burgled of $50,000 in 
laboratory platinum and the Restricted Room was destroyed in 
the process. The newly returned 
scientist was unmasked as an impostor, accused of complicity in 
the crime and handed over to the 
police.

While Reich was laughing at 
the ludicrous search for Marcus 
^ry, his top brass was greeting the 
Continental Tax Examiner, an 
Esper 2, who had arrived for a 
long delayed check on Sacrament's books. This despite the 
fact that Reich owned three Continental Senators. One of the new 
additions to the Examiner's squad 
was a peeper ghostwriter who 
prepared her chief's reports. She 
was an expert in official work . . • 
mainly police work.

Reich smiled grimly and turned 
his company books over to the 
squad. Then he sent Hassop, his 
Code Chief, to Ampro on that 
promised vacation. Hassop obligingly carried a small spool of 
exposed film with his regular 
photographic equipment. That 
spool was Sacrament's secret 
books, cased in a thermite seal 
which would destroy all records 
unless it was opened properly. 
The only other copy was in 
Reich's invulnerable temporalphase safe at home.

¥ IKE an anatomical chart of 
' the blood system, colored red 
for the arterial and blue for the

underworld and overworld grapevines spread. From Guild headquarters the word passed to instructors and students, to their 
families, friends, casual acquaintances. From Quizzard's Casino 
the word was passed from 
croupier to gamblers, confidence 
men, heavy racketeers, hustlers, 
steerers and suckers, 

On Friday morning, Fred Deal, 



Esper 3. awoke, bathed, breakfasted and departed to his regular 

job. He was chief guard on the 
floor of the Mars Exchange B ink 
in Maiden Lane. Stopping to buy 
a new commutation ticket at the 
Pneumatique, he passed the time 
with Biddy MacNaughton, Esper 
3, on duty at the Information 
Desk. Biddy passed Fred the 
word about Barbara D'Courtney 
and Fred memorized the TP picture she flashed him. It was a 
picture framed in dollar signs. 

On Friday morning, Lonzo 
(Snim ) Whittmaker was awakened by his landlady, Chooka 
Frood, with a loud scream for 
back rent. 

"You already makin' a fnibby 
fortune with 'at loopy yella-head 
girl you pick up," Snim complained. "You runnin' a golmine 
withat spook stuff downinna 
basement. Whaddya want from 
me?" 

Chooka Frood pointed out to 
Snim that the yellow-headed girl 
was not crazy. She was a genuine 
medium. Chooka did not run 
rackets: she was a legitimate fortuneteller. If Snim did not come 
through with six weeks roof and 
rolls, Chooka would be able to 
tell his fortune without any 
trouble at all. Snim would be 
out on the asphalt. 

Snim arose. Already dressed, 
he descended into the city to get 
h imself crowned . He inspected 
the charity stands he had set up 



130 




 



on various corners . . . small steel 
coffers with slots in the top and 
signs on the side that read: end 

STARVATION ON CALUSTO. This was 

Snim's private charity and not 
very profitable. The coffers were 
empty. 

It was too early to run up 
to Quizzard's and work the sob 
on the more prosperous clients, 
and anyway there had been that 
tattoo difficulty with Keno. Snim 
touched his new ear delicately 
and tried to sneak a ride uptown 
on the Pneumatique. He was 
thrown out by the peeper change 
clerk and walked. It was a long 
haul to Jerry Church's hockshop, 
but Snim had a gold and pearl 
pocket-pianino up there and he 
was hoping to cadge Church into 
advancing another sovereign on 
It He had to get himself crowned 
today. 

Church was absent on business 
and the clerk could do nothing 
for Snim. Snim told the sob to 
the clerk about hi£ landlady 
crowning herself every day with 
the new spook-shill she was using 
in her palm-racket and still trying 
to milk him when she was rolling. 
The clerk would not weep even 
for the price of coffee. Snim departed. 

When Jerry Church returned 
to the hockshop for a brief timeout in his wild quest for Reich, 
the clerk reported Snim's visit 
and conversation. What the clerk 
did not report, Church peeped. 



He tottered to the phone and 
called Reich. Reich could not be 
located. Church called Keno 
Quizzard. 

Meanwhile, Snim was growing 
a little desperate. He trudged 
downtown to Maiden Lane and 
cased the banks in that pleasant 
esplanade around Bomb Inlet. He 
was not too bright and made the 
mistake of selecting the Mars 
Exchange for a con. It looked 
dowdy and provincial. Snim had 
not learned that it is only the 
powerful and efficient institutions 
that can afford to look secondrate. 

Snim entered the bank, crossed 
the crowded main floor to the row 
of desks opposite the tellers* 
cages, and stole a handful of deposit slips and a pen. As Snim 
left the bank, Fred Deal glanced 
at him once, motioned wearily to 
his staff, then pointed to Snim 
who was disappearing through the 
front door. 

"He's getting ready to pull the 
'Adjustment' routine. Let him go 
ahead with it. We'll pick him up 
after he's got the money and get 
a conviction." 

Unaware of this, Snim lurked 
outside the bank, watching the 
tellers' cages closely. A citizen 
was making a big withdrawal at 
Cage Z. This was the fish. Snim 
hastily removed his jacket, rolled 
up his sleeves and tucked the pen 
in his ear. As the fish came out 
of the bank, counting his money, 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



131 



Snim slipped behind him, darted 
up and tapped the man's 
shoulder. 

"Excuse me, sir," he said 
briskly. "I'm from Cage Z. I'm 
afraid our teller made a mistake 
and shortcounted you. Will you 
come back for the adjustment, 
please?'' 

Snim waved his sheaf of slips, 
•swept the money from the fish's 
fins and turned to enter the bank. 
As the surprised citizen followed 
him, Snim slipped into the crowd 
and headed for the side exit. He 
would be out and away before 
the fish realized he'd been skinned. 

It was at this moment that a 
rough hand grasped Snim's neck. 
He was swung around face to face 
with a bank guard. In one chaotic 
instant, Snim contemplated fight, 
flight, bribery, pleas, Kingston 
Hospital, the bitch Chooka Frood 
and her yellow-headed ghost girl, 
his pocket-pianino and a man 
named Strenn who owned it. 
Then he collapsed and wept. 

The guard flung him to another 
uniform and shouted: "Take him, 
boys. I've just made myself a 
mint!" 

"Is there a reward for this little 
guy, Fred?" 

"Not for him. For what's in his 
head. I've got to call the Guild." 

At nearly the same moment 
late Friday afternoon. Ben Reich 
and Preston Powell received the 
identical information: 



"i;ir! answering ■<> ihr description

Button W«i Side/ 1 

X 

FAMOUS last bulwark in the 
Siege of New York, Bastion 
West Side was a war memorial. 
Its ten torn acres were to have 
been maintained in perpetuity as 
a denunciation of the insanity 
that produced the final war. But 
the final war, as usual, proved to 
be the next-to-the final. Number 
99 was an evicerated ceramics 
plant. A succession of blazing explosions had burst among the 
stock of thousands of chemical 
glazes, fused them, and splashed 
them into a wild splotchy reproduction of a Lunar crater. This 
was the Rainbow House of 
Chooka Frood. 

The top floors had been patched 
and subdivided into a warren of 
cells so complicated and confused that a man could slip from 
cell to cell while the floors were 
being searched, and easily evade 
the most painstaking cordon. 
This unusual complexity netted 
Chooka large profits each year. 

The lower floors were given 
over to Chooka's famous Frab 
Joint, where vice was served to 
order, either grossly or subtly. 

But the cellar of Chooka 
Frood's house was the phenomenon that had inspired her most 
lucrative industry. It was worth 



13? 




 



the hazardous trip to Bastion 
West Side. You threaded your 
way through twisting streets until you reached the streak of 
jagged orange that pointed to the 
door of Chooka's Rainbow House. 
At the door you were met by an 
obscenely solemn person in XXth 
Century formal costume who 
asked: "Frab or Fortune?" You 
replied "Fortune" and were conducted to a sepulchral door where 
you paid a gigantic fee and were 
handed a phosphor candle. Holding the candle aloft, you walked 
down a deep stone staircase. 

Around the rim of the cellar, 
on stone benches, sat the other 
future-seekers, each holding his 
phosphor candle. You joined the 
throbbing, burning silence and 
sat quietly, your candle joining 
the constellation of stars, until at 
last there came the high chime of 
a silver bell. 

Clothed in a cascade of flaming 
music, Chooka Frood entered the 
cellar and paced to the center of 
the floor. 

■ "And there, of course, the illusion ends," Powell said to himself. 
Hf stored at Chooka's not^to 
no^e. flat eyes. "Maybe she can 
act." he muttered nop?f»'U'. 

Chooka stopped in the mMd'e 
o( t li e floor, loo'-'"^ mu?'i Wke a 
frpwsy Medusa, then lifted her 



"I am come here to you," 



Chooka intoned in a hoarse 
voice, "to help you look into the 
deeps of your hearts. Look dawn 
into your hearts, you which are 
looking for revenge on a man 
named Zerlan from Mars . . . 
for the love of a red -eyed woman 
of Callisto ... for the wealth of 
that stingy uncle in Paris . . . *" 

"Why, damn me! The woman's 
a peeper!" 

Chooka stiffened. Her mouth 
hung open. 

"Kou're receiving me, * aren't 
you, Chooka Frood?" 

The answer came in frightened 
fragments. It was obvious that 
Chooka Flood's natural ability 
had never been trained. "Who? 

Which is . . . your" 

As carefully as if he were communicating with an infant 3rd, 
Powell soelled it out: "Name — 
Preston Powell. Occupation — Police Prefect. Intent — to question 
a girl named Barbara D'Courtney. 
I have heard she's participating 
in your act." Powell transmitted 
a picture of the girl. 

It was pathetic the way Chooka 
tried to block. "Get . . . our.' Out 
of here!" 

"Why haven t you come to tha 
Gtff'M 9 Why aren't you in contact 
with vot'r own o°(in/«?" 

"Ge.Wim peeper. Get out." 

"You're a godi^m peeper, too. 
Why .' yvmn't you lot us train you? 
Whtti ' : -"J of lif* h thin for vou? 
Th<* work waiting for 

you, Cl.jjka." 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



"Real money?" 

Powell repressed the wave of 
exasperation that rose up in him. 
It was not exasperation with 
Chooka. It was anger at the relentless force of progress and evolution that insisted on endowing 
man with increased powers without removing the vestigial vices 
that prevented him from using 
them. 

"We'll talk about that later, 
Chooka. Where's the girl?" 

"There is no girl." 

"Peep the customers with me. 
That old goat obsessed with the 
red-eyed woman ..." Powell explored gently. "He's been here 
before. He's waiting for Barbara 
D'Courtney to come in. You dress 
her in sequins. You bring her on 
after about half an hour. He likes 
her looks. She does some kind of 
trance routine to music. Her dress 
is slit open to the thigh and he 
likes that." 

"He's crazy. I never — " 

"And the woman who was 
loused by a man named Zerlan? 
She's seen the girl often, believes 
in her. Where's the girl, Chooka?" 

"No.'" 

"I see. Upstairs. Where upstairs, Chooka? You can't misdirect a lsf. Maybe if you'd let 
the Guild train you — fourth 
room on the left of the angle 
turn. That's a complicated labyrinth you've got up there, Chooka. 
Let's have it once again to make 
sure . . 



Helpless and mortified, Chooka 
suddenly shrieked: "Get out of 
here, you lousy cop!" 

"Excuse it, please," said Powell. 
"I'm on my way." 

He arose and left the room. 

rw^HAT entire investigation occurred within the second it 
took Reich to step from the 
eighteenth to the nineteenth step 
on his way down to Chooka 
Frood's rainbow cellar. Reich 
heard Chooka's " furious screech 
and Powell's reply. He turned and 
shot up the stairs to the main 
floor. 

As he jostled past the door attendant, he thrust a sover< ign 
into the man's hand and hissed: 
"I wasn't here. Understand?" 

•"No one is ever here, sir." 

He made a quick circuit of the 
Frab rooms. Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. 
He brushed by the girls and 
other creatures who solicited him, 
then locked himself into the 
phone booth and punched BD12,232. Church's anxious face appeared on the screen. 

"We*re in a jam. Powell's here." 

"Oh, my God!" 

"Where in hell is Quizzard?" 

"I thought he'd be there." 

"Powell was in the cellar, peeping Chooka. You can bet Quizzard wasn't there. Where in hell 
is he?" 

"I don't know, Ben. He went 
down with his wife and — "

"Powell must have located the 
girl. I've got maybe five minutes 
to beat him to her. Quizzard was 
supposed to do that for me." 

"He must be upstairs in the 
coop." 

"Is there a quick way to get 
up to the coop? A shortcut I 
can use to beat Powell to her?" 

"If Powell peeped Chooka, he 
peeped the shortcut." 

"Maybe he didn't. Maybe he 
was concentrating on the girl. It's 
a chance I'll have to take." 

"Behind the main stairs. 
There's a marble bas-relief. Turn 
the woman's head to the right. 
The bodies separate and there's 
a door to a vertical pneurnatique." 

Reich hung up, left the booth, 
found the bas-relief, twisted the 
woman's head savagely and 
watched the bodies swing apart. 
A steel door appeared. He yanked 
the door open and stepped into 
the open shaft. Instantly a metal 
plate jolted up against his soles 
and with a hiss of air pressure 
he was lofted to the top floor. A 
magnetic catch held the plate 
while he opened the shaft door 
and stepped out of the pneurnatique. 

He found himself in a corridor 
that slanted up at an angle of 
thirty degrees and leaned to the 
left. It was floored with canvas. 
The ceiling glowed at intervals 
with small flickering globes of 
radon. The walls were lined with 
doors, none of them numbered. 



"Quizzard!" Reich shouted. 
, There was no answer. 

Reich ran halfway up the corridor, and then at a venture tried 
a door. It opened to a narrow 
cubby entirely filled with an oval 
bed. Reich crawled across the 
foam mattress to a door on the 
opposite side, thrust it open and 
fell through. He found himself on 
a landing. A flight of steps led 
down to a round anteroom 
rimmed with doors. 

"Quizzard!" he shouted again. 

There was a muffled reply. 
Reich spun on his heels, ran to 
a door and pulled it open. A 
woman with eyes dyed red by 
plastic surgery was standing just 
inside and Reich blundered 
against her. She burst into unaccountable laughter. Reich 
backed away, reached for the 
door, apparently missed it and 
seized the knob of another, for 
he did not come out into the circular foyer. 

He found himself staring up 
into the angry face of Chooka 
Frood. 

"What the hell are you doing 
in my room?" Chooka screamed. 

Reich shot to his feet. "Where 
is she?" 

"Get out of here, Ben Reich.'* 

"Barbara D'Courtney — where 
is she?" 

Chooka turned her head and 
yelled: "Magda!" 

The red-eyed woman came into 
the room. She held a TP scram

bier in her hand and she was still 
laughing; but the gun was trained 
on his skull 

"I want the girl, Chooka, before Powell gets her." 

"Get him out of here, Magda!" 

Reich clubbed the woman 
across the eyes with the back of 
his hand. She fell backward, 
dropping the gun, and into a 
corner, still laughing. Reich ignored her. He picked up the 
scrambler and aimed it at 
Cliouka's temple. 

"Where's the girl?" 

"You go to hell!" 

Reich pulled the trigger back 
into first notch. The radiation 
charged Chooka's nervous system with a low induction current. 
She stiffened and began to tremble, but she still shook her head. 
Reich yanked the trigger back 
to second notch. Chooka's body 
was thrown into a break-bone 
ague. 

"Third notch is death notch," 
he growled. "Where is she?" 

Chooka was almost completely 
paralyzed. "Through . . . door," 
she croaked. "Fourth room . . . 
left . . . after turn." 

Reich dropped her and let her 
fall in a heap alongside the laughing red-eyed woman. He ran out 
of the bedroom, came to a corkscrewed ramp. He mounted it, 
took a sharp turn, stopped at the 
fourth room on the left. He thrust 
open the door and entered. There 
was an empty bed, a single 



dresser, an empty closet, a single 

chair. 

"Gulled!" he snarled. 

The bed showed no sign of use. 
Neither did the closet. He yanked 
at a dresser drawer that was 
partly open. It contained a frost 
white silk gown and a stained 
steel object that looked like a 
malignant flower. It was the murder weapon. 

"My God!" Reich breathed. 

He snatched up the gun and 
inspected it. Its chambers, still 
contained the cartridges without 
slugs. The one that had blown 
the top of Craye D'Courtney's 
head out was still in place under 
the hammer. 

"It isn't Demolition yet. 1 ' Reich 
muttered. "Not by a da:vtncd 
sight." He folded up the revolver 
and thrust it into his pocket. At 
that moment he heard a distant clabbered laugh. Quizzard's 
laugh. 

Reich stepped quickly to the 
twisted ramp and followed the 
sound of the laughter to a plush 
door hung on brass hinges and 
set deep in the wall. Gripping the 
scrambler at the alert with the 
trigger set for Death Notch, 
Reich pulled open the door. 

He was in a small round room, 
walled and ceilinged in midnight 
velvet. The floor was a one- way 
mirror that gave a clear uninterrupted view of a boudoir on the 
floor below. It was Chooka's 
Voytur Chamber.

chair with the girl in his arms, 
his blind eyes staring, Reich 
came to the appalled conclusion 
that the woman's fall was no accident; for Quizzard suddenly 
dropped. The girl tumbled out 
of his arms and fell into the chair. 

There was no doubt that Powell had accomplished this on a 
TP level, and for the first time 
in their war Reich was physically 
afraid. Again he aimed the scrambler, this time at Powell's head 
as the peeper walked to the chair, 

Powell said, "Are you all right, 
Miss D'Courtney?" When the girl 
failed to answer, he bent down 
and stared into her blank, placid 
face. He touched her arm and 



In the boudoir, Quizzard sat in 
a deep chair, his blind eyes blazing. The D'Courtney girl was 
perched on his lap, wearing an 
astonishing slit gown of sequins, 
evidently the costume the girl 
wore for Chooka's fortune act. 
She sat quietly, her yellow hair 
smooth, her deep dark eyes staring placidly into space. 

"How does she look?" Quizzard 
asked a small faded woman who 
stood across the boudoir from 
him, with her back against the 
wall and an incredible expression 
of agony on her face. It was 
Quizzard's wife. 

"Lost," his wife answered in a 
faint voice. "Dead." 

Quizzard fumbled for the girl's 
head and drew it down. He kissed 
her passive mouth. 

"She doesn't took dead now, 
does she?" 

"She doesn't know what's happening." 

"She knows," Quizzard shouted. 
"She isn't that far gone. If I only 
had my eyes!" 

''I'm your eye^, Keno." 

"Then look for me. Tell m< !" 

Reich cursed and aimed the 
scrambler at Quizzard's head. 
Then Powell entered the boudoir. 
The woman saw him at once. 

"Run, Keno! Run!" 

She thrust herself from the wall 
and darted toward Powell, her 
hands clawing for his eyes. Then 
she fell prone and never moved. 
As Quizzard surged up from the

repeated: "Are you all right? Do 
you need help?" 

At the word "help" the girl 
whipped upright in the chair in 
a listening attitude. Then she 
thrust out her legs and leaped 
from the chair. She ran past Powell in a straight line, stopped 
abruptly and reached out as 
though grasping a doorknob. She 
thrust an imaginary door open 
and burst forward, yellow hair 
flying, dark eyes wide with alarm 
... a lightning flash of wild 
beauty. 

"Father!" she screamed. "For 
God's sake! Father!" 

She ran forward, stopped short 
and backed away. She darted to 
the left, stopped and struggled 
with imaginary arms that held 
her. She fought and screamed, her 
eyes still fixed, then stiffened and 
clapped her hands to her ears as 
though a violent sound had 
pierced them. She fell forward to 
her knees and crawled.. Then she 
stopped, snatched at something 
on the floor, and remained 
crouched on her knees. 

With sickening certainty. Reich 
knew she had relived the death 
of her father. She had relived it 
for Powell. And if he had peeped 
her ... 

Powell went to the girl and 
raised her from the floor. She 
arose as gracefully as a dancer, 
as serenely as a somnambulist. 
The peeper put his arm around 
her and took her to the door. 



Reich followed him all the way 
with the muzzle of the scrambler, 
waiting for the best shooting 
angle. He was invisible. He, could 
win safety with a shot. Powell 
opened the door, then suddenly 
looked up. 

"Go ahead." Powell called. 
"One shot for the both of us. 
Go ahead!" He stared up at the 
invisible Reich, waiting, hating, 
daring. 

Reich turned his face away 
from the man who could not see 
him. 

Powell took the docile girl 
through the door and closed it 
quietly behind him, and Reich 
knew he had permitted safety to 
slip through his fingers.

"She's in hysterical recall," Dr. 
Johnny Jeems of Kingston Hospital explained to Powell and

Powell's house, "She responds to 
the key word 'help' and relives

"The death of her father," Powell said,

t . . catatonia." 

"Permanent?" Mary Noyes 
asked. 

Jecms looked surprised and indignant. He was one of the 
brighter young men of Kingston 
Hospital and fanatically devoted 
to his work. "In this day and age? 
Nothing is permanent except 
death, Miss Noyes, and up at 
Kingston we've started working 
on that. Investigating death from 
the nosogenic point of view, we've 
actually — " 

"Later, Johnny," Powell interrupted. "No lectures tonight. Can 
I peep her?" 

Jeems considered. "No reason 
why not. I gave her the Deja 
Eprouve Series for catatonia. 
That shouldn't get in the way." 

"What's the Deja Eprouve 
Series?" Mary asked. 

"A gr< at new treatment," Jeems 
said excitedly. "Patient goes into 
catatonia. It's flight from reality. 
The conscious mind wishes it had 
(fever been born. It attempts to 
revert back to the foetal stage. 
You understand?" 

Mary nodded. "So far." 

"We use Deja Eprouve. That's 
psychiatric French for 'something already experienced, already tried.* Many patients, on 
the basis of the wish, feel that an 
act of experience in which they 
never engaged has happened. We 
synthesize this Deja Eprouve for 
the patient. We send the conscious mind back to the womb 



and let it pretend it's being born 
all over again. We- make the catatonic wish come true. Got that?" 
"Got it." 

"On the surface, consciously, 
the patient goes through development all over again at an accelerated rate . . infancy, 
childhood, adolescence and finally maturity." 

"You mean Barbara D'Courtney is going to be a baby, learn 
to speak, walk?" 

"Right. Takes about three 
weeks. By the time she catches 
up with herself, she'll be ready to 
accept the reality she's trying to 
escape. She'll have grown up 
to jt, so to speak. This Is only on 
the conscious level. Below that, 
she won't be touched. You can 
peep her all you like. Only 
trouble is she must be pretty 
scared down there. You'll have 
trouble getting what you want. 
Of course, that's your specialty. 
You'll know what to do." 

Jeems stood up abruptly. "Got 
to get back to the shop." He made 
for the front door. "Always delighted to be called in by peepers. 
I can't understand the recent hostility toward you people . . . "' 
He was gone. 

"That was a significant parting note." 

"What'd he mean, Pres. 3 " 

"Peepers haven't been dning 
business with enough normals, 
We keep to ourselves too much. 
That starts economic pressures

and prejudices. Have to bring 
that up in Council later. Bring 
Barbara down, Mary." 

Mary brought the girl downstairs and seated her on the low 
severe dais. (Powell had recently 
reconverted his decor to XXth 
Century Swedish.) Barbara sat 
like a calm statue. Mary had 
dressed her in blue leotards and 
combed her blonde hair back, 
tying it into a fox-tail with a blue 
ribbon. 

"Lovely outside; mangled inside. Damn Reich!" 

"What about him?" 

"I was so mad at Chooka 
Frood's coop, I handed it to that 
red slug Quizzard and his wife." 

"What did you do to Quizxard?" 

"Basic neuro-shock. Come up 
to the Lab sometime and we'll 
show you. If you make 1st, we'll 
teach you. It's like the scrambler, 
but psychogenic." 

"Fatal?" 

"Forgotten the Pledge? Of 
course not." 

"And you peeped Reich through 
the floor? How?" 

"TP reflection. The Voyeur 
Chamber wasn't wired for sound. 
It had open acoustical ducts. 
Reich's mistake. He was transmitting down the channel and I 
swear I was hoping he had the 
gut- to shoot. I was going to blast 
hit •vith a Basic that would have 
m?"~' ■ case history." 

"Why didn't he shoot?" 



"He had every reason to kill 
us. He thought he was safe, didn't 
know about the Basic, even 
though Quizzard's Decline & Fall 
jolted him. But he couldn't." 

"Afraid?" 

"Reich's no coward. He just 
couldn't. Unconscious inhibition 
of some sort, but I don't know 
what. Maybe next time it'll be 
different. That's why I'm keeping 
Barbara D'Courtney in my 
house. This is one place where 
she'll be safe." 

"She'll be safe in Kingston 
Hospital." 

"But not quiet enough for the 
work Vve got to do." 

"•/>" 

"She's got the detailed picture 
of the murder locked up in her 
hysteria. When I've got it, I've 
got Reich" 

Mary arose. "Exit Mary 
Noyes." 

"Sit down, peeper! Why d'you 
think I called you?" 

"No, you don't Mr. Powell." 
Mary burst into laughter. "So 
that's it. You want me for a chaperone. Victorian word, isn't? So 
are you, Pres. Positively atavistic." 

"I brand that as a He. I'm 
known as the most progressive — " 

"And what's that im^ge? 
Knights of the Round Table. Sir 
Galahad Powell. And there's 
sametliing underneath that. I — " 
Suddenly she stopped laughing 
and turned pale.

"What'd you dig?" 

"Forget it, Pres. And don't 
peep me for it. If you can't reach 
it yourself, you'd better not get 

it second-hand. Especially from 
me." 

He looked at her curiously for 
a moment. "All right, Mary. Then 
we'd better go to work." To Barbara D'Courtney he said : "Help, 
Barbara." 

Instantly she whipped upright 
on the dais in a listening attitude, and he probed delicately 
. . . Sensation of bedclothes . . . 
Voice calling dimly . , . "Whose 
voice, Barbara?" Deep in the 
preconscious she answered : "Who 
is that?" "A friend, Barbara." 
"There's no one. No one. I'm 
alone." And she was alone, racing 
down a corridor to thrust a door 
open and burst into an orchid 
room to see — "What, Barbara?" 
"A man. Two men." "Who?" "Go 
away. Please go away. I don't 
like voices. There's a voice 
screaming in my ears ..." 

She was screaming while terror 
made her dodge from a dim figure 
that clutched at her to keep her 
from her father. "What is your 
father doing, Barbara?" "He — ■ 
no. you don't belong here. There's 
only the three of us. Father and 
me and — " A flash of the face. 
"Look again, Barbara. Sleek 
head. Wide eyes. Small straight 
nose. Small sensitive mouth. Like 
a scar. Is that the man? Look at 
the picture. Is that the man?" 



"Yes. Yes." And then all waS 
gone. 

She was kneeling again, placid, 
doll-like. 

Powell wiped perspiration from 
his face and took the girl back 
to the dais. Hysteria cushioned 
the emotional impact for her, He 
was reliving her terror, naked 
and unprotected. 

"It was Ben Reich, Mary. Did 
you get the picture, too?" 

"Couldn't stay in long enough, 
Pres. Had to run for cover." 

"It was Reich, all right. Only 
question is, how in hell did he 
kill her father? What did he use? 
Why didn't old D'Courtney put 
up a fight to defend himself? 
Have to try again. I hate to do 
this to her ..." 

"/ hare you to do this to yourself. Pres." 

"Have to." He took a deep 
breath and said : "Help. Barbara." 

Again she whipped upright on 
the dais in a listening attitude. 
"Not so fast. There's plenty of 
time." "You again?" "Remember 
me, Barbara?" "No, I don't know 
you. Get out." "But I'm part of 
you, Barbara. We're running 
down the corridor together. See? 
We're opening the door together. 
It's so much easier together. We 
help each other." "We?" "Yes, 
Barbara, you and I. When you 
talk to yourself when you're 
alone, you talk to me. That's who 
I am." "Look at father! For pity's

Sake, help me!" 

She knelt again, placid, dolllike. 

Powell felt a hand under his 
arm and realized he was not supposed to be kneeling too. The 
body before him slowly disappeared, the orchid room disappeared; and Mary Noyes was 
straining to raise him. 

"You first this time," she said 
grimly. He shook his head. "All 
right, Sir Galahad. Cool a while." 

Mary raised the girl and led 
her to the dais. Then she returned to Powell. "Ready for help 
now, or don't you think it's 
manly?" 

"The word is virile. Don't waste 
your time trying to help me up. 
I need brain power." 

"What'd you peep?" 

"D'Courtney wanted to be murdered." 

"The hell you say!" 

"The hell I don't. I've got to 
see D'Courtney's M.D, first thing 
in the morning." 

SAM @kins, E.M.D. 1, received 
$1,000 per hour of analysis, 
two million dollars per year, but 
Sam was efficiently killing himself with charity work. He was 
one of the burning lights of the 
Guild's long-range education plan, 
and leader of the Environment 
Clique which believed that telepathic ability was not a congenital characteristic, but a latent 
quality which could be developed 



by suitable training. 

He invited everyone in the low 
income brackets to bring their 
problems to him, and while he 
was ironing them out he was carefully attempting to foster telepathy in his patients. So far, 
the results had been the discovery 
of 2% Latent Espers, which was 
under the average of the Guild 
Institute interviews, but Sam was 
undiscouraged. 

Powell found him charging 
through the garden, vigorously 
destroying flowers under the impression that he was cultivating. 
He was snorting and shouting 
at plants and patients alike. 

"Damn it, don't you tell me 
that's a zinnia. Don't I know a 
weed when I see it? Hand me 
the rake, Bernard." 

A small man in black handed 
him the rake and said : "My name 
is Walter, Dr. @kins." 

@kins grunted, tearing out a 
clump of green that was neither 
weed nor zinnia, but marigold. 
"Why in hell are you running 
away from Bernard? Who taught 
you that semantic loophole?" 

"I was hoping you'd tell me, 
Dr. @kins," Walter replied. 

"You remind me of Alice 
Bright. Where is that makebelieve slut anyway?" 

A pretty red-headed girl jostled 
through the crowd and smirked; 
"Here I am, Dr. @kins." 

"Well, don't preen yourself because I called you a name." @kins, 



Ul

frowned at her and continued on 
the TP level: "'I'm a woman,' 
you tell yourself. 'Therefore, men 
desire me. It's enough to know 
that thousands of men could have 
me if I'd let them. That makes 
me real.' Well, it doesn't. It's no 
substitute for living — nothing is." 

(ffikins waited impatiently for a 
response, but the girl merely postured before him. Finally he burst 
out: "Didn't any of you hear 
what I told her?'' 

"I did, teacher." 

"Oh, you. Hi, Pres. How about 
this crowd of dead heads? Too 
lazy to peep a simple question." 

"Lay off that plant, Sam. It's 
a tomato." 

"It's a weed." 

"Sam, you busted botany our 
first year. I'm telling you it's 
tomato." Powell turned to The patients. "What kind of plant is 
that?" 

"Tomato." they said. 

Sam pulled it up. "I'm allergic 
to tomatoes." he announced with 
an air of having had the final 
word. "What's on your mind, 
Pres?" 

"When you get a chance I'd 
like to ask a couple of questions 
about a dead patient." 

"Who?" 

"D'Courtney. Our Mr. Peetcy 
is very curious about him." 

"Oh. Give me another half hour 
with my flock. Say, young Chervils here, waiting to see me too. 
Anything wrong in the family? 



He seemed real upset. Go talk to 
him." 

Powell let out a blast: "CHERVIL!" 

One of Skins' flock flinched and 
Sam turned on the man excitedly. 
"You heard that, didn't you, 
Hopkins?" 

"No, sir. I didn't hear nothing." 

"Then why did you jump?" 

"A bug bit me." 

"It did not!" "kins roared. 
"There are no bugs in my garden. 
You heard Mr. Powell." 

Young Gaily Chervil answered 
from the house and Powell left 
the garden, tf'kins yelled after 
him: "Powell, you've discovered 
the answer. We've got to yell loud 
enough for these lazybones." And 
then he began a frightful rn-'tet: 
"YOU CAN ALL HEAR MB. 
DON'T SAY YOU CAN'T." 

Powell found young Gaily pacing distractedly before the F-^nch 
windows facing the garden. He 
looked up gloomily. "Hi, Mr. 
Powell." 

"Pip. Gaily." 

"Pop, Mr. Powell. Also Bim, 
Bam and (censored)." 

From the garden Skins complained : "Stop broaden rmg. 
You're jamming the band. T~>1k" 

Powell grinned. "How you iixed 
for words. Gaily?" 

"They fail me." 

"Trouble?" 

Gaily nodded. '*YaM belie * Dr. 
fokins?" 

"Not about flowers."

"I mean his Idea about everybody being an Esper." 

"We'd all like to believe him. 
He hasn't convinced anybody 
yet." 

"He's got to be right," Gaily 
muttered. "That girl I met at the 
Beaumont party the night 
D'Courtney was killed — " 

"Duffy Wyg&? What about 
her?" 

Gaily burst out: "I'm going to 
marry her." 

"Oh? She isn't a peeper." 

"Dr. @kins says everybody is." 

"Moral support, eh?" 

"Are you against it, Mr. Powell?" 

"The Guild is, Gaily. You know 
why. Sam„@kins is wrong. Guild 
stat : tics show that when peepers 
marry non-peepers, few of their 
children are peepers. It's like 
blue eyes ... a recessive inherited 
characteristic. We can't take a 
chance on losing it." 

"That's the Guild answer, Mr. 
Powell, but I asked you. Are you 
against it?" 

"She's a lovely girl. Gaily. 
Sharp, smart, talented. That's 
why I'm against it." 

"That's why?" 

"For her sake, not yours. Peepers have marrbd outside. The 
marriages always fail because they 
ar * based on equality. Living 
with ?i peeper ma';es an outsider 
feel tippled. Duffy Wyg& would 
end un hating you, loathing herself; no longer sharp, smart, tal


ented, lovely. If you love her. 
Gaily, don't destroy her. Let her 
go." 

(akins came bouncing into the 
room. "It's a great discovery, 
Powell. Sensational. They heard 
me. My brains are hoarse, but, 
by God, they heard me," 

"How many specific responses 
did you get?" 

"Well, none, but that's because 
they're stubborn. Ashamed to be 
peepers. Now, Gaily, what's with 
you? Spit jt out. I've got a 
schedule." 

Young Chervil hesitated. The 
TP band crackled with blocks, 
releases and adjustments. Finally 
it came; "Nothing in particular, 
sir. Just a friendly call." 

"Friendly? Then why that expression, 3 " 

After Gaily had evaded the 
question and left, Powell painted 
the picture, (n'kins was properly 
apologetic, but unimpressed by 
Chervil's courage. Fifteen years 
of happy marriage make a man 
unsympathetic to the trials of 
callow romance. 

"He'll fall in love with a peeper 
and live happily ever after. Now 
what's with D'Courtney?" 

Powell presented the problem. 
Reich had definitely murdered 
D'Courtney. Powell did not know 
why or how; but one point was 
clear and perplexing and would 
have to be cleared up for Mr. 
Peetcy. Reich had thrust the murder weapon into D'Courtney's

mouth and blown out the back 
of his head with it. That was 
virtually impossible with the 
killer struggling with the daughter 
on one hand and the victim on 
the other . . . unless the victim 
was not trying to defend himself. 

"/ see. The answer is yes. He 
was probably happy to die." 
' How? Why?" 

"He was regressing under emotional exhaustion and on the verge 
ol suicide. He came here from 
his home on Mars only because I 
raised such a fuss that it was 
easier for him to give in Retch's 
little gift must have come as a 
welcome surprise" 

"Why was D'Courtney set on 
suicide?" 

"If I knew, he wouldn't have 
been. Reich turned my case into 
a failure. I could have saved 

Courtney." 

"You made any guesses why 
D'Courtney's pattern was crumbling?" 

"Yes. He was trying to take 
drastic action to escape a deep 
guilt." 

"Guilt about what?" 

"His child." 

"Barbara? How? Why?" 

"I don't know. He was fighting symbols of abandonment, desertion, shame, loathing, cowardice. We were J,oing to work 
on that That's all I know." 

"Could Reich have figured and 
counted on all this? That's some


thing Mr. Peetcy is going to fust 

about." 

"He might have guessed — impossible. He'd need expert help 
to—" 

"Hold it, Sam. You've got 
something hidden under that. I'd 
like to get it if I can ..." 

"Go ahead. I'm wide open." 

"Easy now . . . Association with 
festivity . . . Party . . . Conversation at my party. Last month. 
Gus T8. an expert himself, but 
needing help on a similar patient 
of his own, he said. If T8 needed 
help, you reasoned Reich certainly would need help." Powell 
was so upset he spoke aloud. 
"Well, how about that, peeper?" 

"How about what?" 

"Gus T8 was at the Beaumont 
party the night D'Courtney was 
killed He came with Reich, but 
I kept hoping — " 

"Pres. I don't believe Hf 

"Neither did I, but there it is. 
Little Gus was Reich's expert. 
He pumped you and turned it 
over to a killer. What price the 
Galen Pledge now?'* 

"What price Demolition?" 
@kiiM answered fiercely. 

From somewhere inside the 
house came an announcement 
from Snlly (Skins: "Pres. P'- -e.'* 

Powell loped down a h"" T oward the phone alcove. H' iw 
$$on's face on the screen. 

"Lucky I caught you, ' "ss. 
We've got six hours." 

"Take it from the top, $$on." 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



145 



"Your Rhodopsin man, Dr. 
Wilson %maine, is back from 
Callisto. Now a man of property 
by courtesy of Ben Reich. I came 
back with him. He's in town for 
six hours to settle his affairs, and 
then he rockets back to Callisto 
to live on his new estate forever." 

"Damn this phone. Who can 
get a picture with words? Will 
J^maine talk?" 

"Would I call you if he would? 
He's grateful to Reich who (I 
am now quoting) generously 
stepped out of the legal picture 
in favor of Dr. %maine and 
justice. If you want anything, 
bring your grapnel." 

" A ND this," Powell said, "is 
■** our Guild Laboratory, Dr. 
^maine." 

%maine was impressed. The 
entire top floor of the Guild building was devoted to laboratory 
research. It was a circular floor, 
almost a thousand feet in diameter, domed with a double 
layer of controlled quartz that 
could give graded illumination 
from full to total darkness, including monochrome light to 
within one-tenth of an angstrom. 

"I haven't much time, Mr. 
Powell," %maine said. 

"Of course not. Very kind of 
you to give us an hour. That may 
be enough for you to help us." 

"Anything to do with D'Courtney?" i^maine asked. 

"Who? Oh, the murder. What


ever put that into your mind?" 

"I've been hounded," J^maine 
said grimly. 

"We're asking for research 
guidance, not information on a 
murder case. What's murder to 
a scientist?" 

J^maine relaxed a little. "Very 
true. You have only to look at 
this laboratory to realize that. 
And I won't be peeped?" 

"Dr. ^maine," Powell said in 
hurt tones. "I gave you the word 
of a scientist." 

"Of course." %maine pointed 
to a bench. "What's all that? 
Symbiosis?" 

"Let's have a look, shall wc?" 
Powell took %maine's arm. To 
the entire laboratory he broadcast: "Stand by, peepers! Here's 
a guy that's got to be buttered. 
He specializes in visual physiology and he's got information ! 
wetnt him to volunteer. Kindly 
fake all kinds obscure-type visual* 
problems and beg for help." 

They came by in droves. A researcher, actually working on a 
problem of a transitor which 
would record the TP impulse, 
hastily invented the fact that TP 
transmission was monochrome 
and humbly requested enlightenment. A pair of pretty girls, engrossed in the infuriating deadend of long-range telepathic 
transmission, demanded of Dr. 
%maine why transmission of visual images always fell off ten 
angstroms, which it did not. The 



140 




 



Japanese team, experts on the 
Galen Node, center of TP perceptivity, insisted that the Galen 
Node was in circuit with the Optic Synapse (it wasn't within two 
centimeters of same) and besieged Dr. %maine with specious 
proofs. 

At 1 :00 p. m., Powell said : "I'm 
sorry to interrupt, but your hour 
is finished and you've got important business to — " 

"Quite all right." %maine interrupted. "Now, my dear doctor, if you would try a transec-. 
tio'n of the optic — " 

At 2:00, a buffet luncheon was 
served without interrupting the 
feast of reason. Dr. %maine, 
flushed and ecstatic, confessed 
that he loathed the idea of being 
rich on Callisto. No scientists 
there. He also confided to Powell 
how he had inherited his estate. 
Seemed that Craye D'Courtney 
originally owned it. The old Reich 
(Ben's father) must have swindled it one way or another, and 
placed it in his wife's name. 
When she died, it went to her son. 
Ben Reich must have had conscience qualms, for he threw . it 
into open court, and Wilson 
J4maine somehow came up with 
it. 

"And he must have plenty more 
on his conscience," %maine said. 
"The things I saw when I worked 
for him! But all these financiers 
arc crooks. You agree?" 

"I disagree about Ben Reich," 



Powell replied, striking the noble 
note. "I admire him very much," 

"Of course," %maine agreed 
hastily. "After all, he does have 
a conscience." 

Powell became a fellow-conspirator and captivated J^mainc with 
a grin. "As fellow scientists we 
can deplore; but as men of the 
world we can only praise." 

"You do understand." J/^maine 
shook Powell's hand effusively. 

At 4:00, Dr. %maine informed 
the polite Japanese that he would 
gladly volunteer his most secret 
work on Visual Purple, in effect, 
handing on the torch to the next 
generation. His eyes moistened 
and his throat choked, with sentiment as he spent twenty minutes carefully describing the 
Rhodopsin Ionizer he had developed for Sacrament. 

At 5:00, the Guild scientists escorted Dr. %maine by launch to 
his Callisto rocket. They filled 
his stateroom with gifts and flowers; they filled his ears with 
grateful testimonials, and he took 
off with the pleasant conviction 
that he had materially benefited 
science and never betrayed that 
fine, generous patron, Mr. Benjamin Reich. 

T>ARBARA was in the living 
room on all fours, crawling 
energetically. She had just been 
fed and her face was eggy. 

"Hajaja," she said. "Haja." 

"Mary! Come quick! She's 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

talking! Barbara's talking!" 

"No!" Mary ran in from the 
kitchen. "What'd she say?" 

"She called me dada." 

"Haja," said Barbara. 

Mary blasted him with scorn. 
"She said haja." She returned to 
the kitchen. 

"She meant dada. Is it her fault 
if she's too young to articulate?" 
Powell knelt alongside Barbara. 
"Say dada, baby. Dada?" 

"Haja," Barbara replied with 
an enchanting drool. 

Powell gave it up. He went 
down past the conscious level to 
the preconscious. 

"Hello, Barbara." 

"You again?" 

"Remember me? I'm the guy 
that pries into your private little 
turmoil down here. We fight it 
out together." 

"Just the two of us?" 

"Just the two of us. Do you 
know who you are? Would you 
like to know why you're buried 
way down here in this solitary 
existence?" 

"Tell me." 

"You were born. You had a 
mother and a father. You grew 
up into a lovely girl with blonde 
hair raid dark eyes and a graceful 
figure. You traveled from Mars 
to Earth with your father and 
you were — 

"No. There's no one but you." 

"I'm really sorry, but we must 
go through the agony again" 

"I don't know what you mean, 



but please . . . please !■ Just the 
two of us alone together in the 

darkness." 

"There was your father in th* 
other room, the orchid room, and 
suddenly we heard something 
..." Powell took a deep breath 
and cried: "Help, Barbara!" 

Sensation of bedclothes. Cool 
floor under running feet and the 
endless corridor until at last they 
burst through the door into the 
orchid room and screamed and 
dodged the startled grasp of Ben 
Reich while he raised something 
to Father's mouth. Raised what? 
Hold that image. Photograph it. 
Christ! That horrible muffled explosion. The worshipped figure 
crumpling unbelievably. They 
moaned and crawled across the 
floor to snatch a malignant steel 
flower from the waxen — 

Powell found himself dragged 
to his feet by Mary Noyes. The 
air was crackling with indignation. 

"Can't I leave you alone for a 
minute?" 

"What's the time, Mary?" 

"9:40. / came in and found you 
two kneeling there." Image of 
angry fists. 

"I know. But I got what I was 
after. It was a gun, Mary. Ancient explosive weapon. Clear picture. Take a look ..." 

"Where'd he get it? Museum?" 

"I don't think so. I'm going to 
play a long shot, kill two birds." 

Powell lurched to the phone and 



14a 




 



dialed BD-12,232. Presently, 
Jeremy Church's twisted face appeared on the screen. 
"Hi, Jerry." 

"Hello, Powell." Cautious. 
Guarded. 

"Did Gus T8 buy a gun from 
you, Jerry?" 

"Gun?" 

"Explosive weapon. XXth Century style. Used in the D'Courtney murder," 

"No!" 

"Yes! I think Gus T8 is our 
killer, Jerry. Mr. Peetcy thinks 
so too. I'd like to bring the picture of the gun over and check 
if he bought it from you." Powell 
hesitated and then stressed the 
next words gently: "It'd be a big 
help, Jerry, and I'll be extremely 
appreciative. Extremely. Wait for 
me. I'll be over in half an hour." 

Powell hung up. He looked at 
Mary. Image of an eye winking. 
"That ought to give little Gus 
time to hustle over.'" 

"Why Gus? When did Peetcy 
come up with that notion? I 
thought Ben Reich was — " She 
caught the picture Powell had 
sketched in at Skins' house. "I 
see. Church sold the gun to 
Reich." 

"Maybe. He does run a hockshop, and that's next thing to a 
museum." 

"So you're playing T8 and 
Church against each other." 

"And both against Reich. We've 
failed on the objective level. 



From here on it's got to be peeper 

tricks." 

"But suppose you can't play 
them against Reich. What if they 
call Reich in?" 

"They can't. We started Keno 
Quizzard running for his life, and 
Reich's out sdmewhere trying to 
cut him off and gag him." 

"You really are a thief, Pres!" 

"Why, thank you, Mary. That's 
a lovely compliment." 

XII 

HPHE pawnshop was in darkness. 

A single limited-radiation 
lamp burned on the counter, sending out its sphere of soft light to 
a radius of two feet. As the three 
men spoke, they leaned in and 
'out of the illumination. 

"No," Powell said sharply. 
"You two peepers may consider 
it an insult to have words addressed to you. I consider it evidence of good faith. While I'm 
talking, I'm not peeping." 

Not necessarily, T8 answered. 
His gnome face popped into the 
light. "You've been known to 
finesse, Powell." 

"Not now. What I want from 
you two, I want objectively. I'm 
working on a murder. Peeping 
isn't going to do me any good." 

"What do you want, Powell?" 
Church cut in. 

"I know you didn't sell the 
gun to Gus. You sold it to Ben 
Reich." 

T8's face came back into the light. "Then why'd you claim I 
bought it?** 

"To get you here for a talk, 
Gus." He turned toward Church. 
"You had the gun, Jerry. Reich 
came here for it. You did business together before. I haven't 
forgotten the Chaos Swindle ..." 

"Damn you!" Church shouted. 

"It swindled you out of the 
Guild," Powell continued. "You 
and Reich split close to half a 
million between you on that. As 
I recall, you offered your share to 
the Guild for reinstatement ..." 

"And you turned me down!" 

"All I'm asking for is the gun," 
Powell said quietly. 

"Are you offering a deal?" 

"You know me. Jerry. Would 
I make a shady offer like that?" 

"Then what are you paying for 
the gun?" 

"You'll have to trust me to do 
the fair thing; but I'm making 
no promises." 

"I've got a promise," Church 
muttered. 

"You'll have to make up your 
mind — trust me or trust Ben 
Reich. Whet about the gun?" 

Church's face disappeared from 
the light. After a pause, he spoke 
from the darkness. "I sold no 
gun. peeper, and I don't know 
how any gun was used. That's my 
objective evidence." 

"Thanks, Jerry." Powell smiled, 
shruRRed and turned again to 
T8. "I just want to ask you one 
technical question, Gus. Skipping 



over the fact that you're Ben 

Reich's accessory ..." 

"Wait a minute, Powell — " 

"Keep it on the acoustical level, 
Gus, and don't get panicky. All I 
want to know is how Guild conditioning failed with you. You're 
a professional analyst and you 
might be able to locate the flaw 
in our processing before we break 
you.** • 

"Break me? For what?" The 
calm assurance T8 found in Powell's mind, the casual acceptance 
of his ruin as an accomplished 
fact, jolted the little peeper. 

"You'd better start looking for 
a good hockshop location. No, 
you could probably do better with 
a tea-leaf act. But while you're 
still a Guild member, I wish 
you'd devote some attention to 
your own case. How did we fail 
with you? At what level? I'd appreciate a report before you're 
dead." 

"What do you mean, dead?** 

"Exiled. Expelled. Look at 
Jerry. He's a picture of yc» after 
the next council meeting." 

"You'll never prove anything. 
You'll—" 

"You little fool. Haven't you 
ever been at a protested trial? 
Mr. Peetcy won't be handling 
your case. No, you stand before 
the board and T'sung-Hsai, 
f*"kins, Joyce, Chevisance, Vigo, 
Catzerie. Tudor Franion — all IstS 
— start probing. I tell you, you're 
dead."

"Wait, Powell!" The mannequin face was twitching with terror. "The Guild taken confession 
into account. When you get niixed 
up with a damned psychotic like 
Reich, you identify yourself with 
it. He came to me with a nightman- about a man with no face. 
He—'' 

"He was a patient?" 

"Ves. That's how he trapped 
me. But I'm out of it now. Tell the 
Guild I'm volunteering everything. Church is your witness . . .** 

"I'm no witness," Church 
shouted. "You dirty squealer! 
After Ben Reich promised — " 

"Shut up. You were crazy 
enough to trust Reich. I'll bust 
him first. I'll walk into court and 
sit on the witness stand and do 
everything I can to help Powell." 

"You'll do nothing of the kind," 
Powell snapped. "You're still in 
the Guild. Since when does a 
peeper squeal on a patient?" 

"It's the evidence you need to 
get Reich, isn't it?" 

"Sure, but I'm not letting any 
peeper disgrace the rest of us." 

"It could mean your job if you 
don't get him." 

"I want it and I want Reich . . . 
but not at this price. It takes guts 
to hold to the Pledge when the 
heat's on. You ought to know. 
You didn't have the guts." 

"But I was an accessory!" T8. 
shouted. "You're letting me off. 
Is that ethics?" 

"Look at him," Powell laughed. 



"He's, begging for Demolition. No, 
Gus. We'll get you when we get 
Reich . But I can't get him 
through you. Don't forget that 
report." 

He left the circle of light, walked through the darkness toward 
the front door. He had played the 
entire scene for this moment 
alone, but there was no action on 
his hook. 

As Powell opened the door. 
Church suddenly called: "Just a 
minute." 

Powell stopped, silhouetted 
against the cold street light. 
"Yes?" 

"What have you been handing 
T8?" 

"The Pledge. Jerry. You ought 
to remember it." 

"Let me peep you on that." 

"Go ahead." Most of Powell's 
blocks opened. What was not 
good for Church to discover was 
carefulty jumbled and camouflaged. 

"I don't know," Church said 
at last. "I can't make up my 
mind about you and Reich and 
the gun. God knews, you're a 
mealy-mouthed preacher, but I 
think maybe I'd be smarter to 
trust you." 

"I told you I can't make any 
promises." 

"Maybe the whole trouble with 
me is that I've always been looking for promises instead of — " 

At that moment. Powell whirled 
and slammed the door. "Get off 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



the floor! Quick!" He vaulted 
onto the counter. "Up here with 
me!" 

A queasy greasy shuddering 
seized the pawnshop and shook it 
into horrible vibration. Powell 
kicked the light globe and extinguished it. 

"Jump for the ceiling light 
bracket and hold on. It's a harmonic gun. Jump!" Church gasped and leaped up into the 
darkness. Powell gripped T8's 
shaking arm. "Too short, Gus? 
I'll toss you." 

He flung T8 upward and 
followed, clawing for the steel 
spider arms of the bracket. The 
three hung in space, cushioned 
against the murderous vibrations 
enveloping the store . . . vibrations that created shattering 
harmonics in every substance in 
contact with the floor. Glass, 
steel, stone, plastic all screeched 
and burst apart. T8 groaned. 

"Hang on, Gus. It's one of 
Quizzard's killers. Careless bunch. 
They've missed me before." 

Destruction loomed up in the 
little peeper's subconscious. Powell knew that this was his crucial 
opportunity. T8's hands relaxed 
and he dropped to the floor. The 
vibrations ceased an instant later, 
but in that split-second Powell 
heard the burst of flesh. Church 
heard it too and raised steam for 

a sfariek. 

"Quier, Jerry' Not yet. Hang 
on!" 



"D-did you hear him?" 
*7 heard. We're not safe yet. 
Hang onr 

The pawnshop door opened a 
slit. A razor edge of light shot 
in and searched the floor. It 
found a broad red and gray organic puddle, then blinked out. 
The door closed. 

"They think I'm dead again. 
You can have your hysterics 
now" 

"I cant get down, Powell. I 
can't step on . . 

"I don't blame you." Powell 
held himself with one hand, look 
Church's arm and swung him toward the counter. Church dropped and shuddered. Powell followed him, fighting hard against 
nausea. 

"Did you say that was one of 
Quizzard's killers?" 

"Sure. He owns a squrd of 
psycho-goons. They're Ben's deputies right now, though. Ben's 
getting panicky." 

"Ben Reich? But it was in my 
shop. I might have been here." 

"You were here. What difference did that make?" 

"Reich wouldn't want ntr 

killed." 

"Wouldn't he?" Image of a 
cat smiling. 

Church took a deep breath. 
Suddenly he exploded: "The goddam son of a bitch!" 

"Don't feel like th;it. .Wry. 
Reich's fighting for his life. You 
can't expect him to be too con


154 




 



siderate of anybody else." 

"Well, I'm fighting, too. Get 
ready, Powell. I'm going to give 
you everything." 

A FTER he finished with 
^* Church and returned from 
headquarters and the T8 nightmare, Powell was grateful for 
the sight of the urchin in his 
home. Barbara D'Courtney had 
a black crayon in her right hand 
and a red crayon in her left. She 
was energetically scribbling on 
the walls, her tongue between her 
teeth and her dark eyes squinted 
in concentration. 

"Baba!" he exclaimed in a 
shocked voice. "What are you 
doing?" 

"Drawrin pitchith for Dada," 
she lisped. 

"Thank you, sweetheart," he 
said. "That's a lovely thought. 
Now come and sit with Dada." 

"No," she said, and continued 
scribbling. 

"Doesn't my girl always do 
what Dada asks?" 

She thought that over. "Yeth," 
she said. She deposited the crayons in her pocket, her bottom on 
the couch alongside Powell, her 
grubby paws in his hands. 

"Really, Barbara," Powell murmured. "That lisping is beginning 
to worry me. I wonder if your 
teeth need braces." 

The thought was only half a 
joke. It was difficult to remember 
that this was a woman seated 



alongside him. Slowly he probed 
through the paralyzed conscious 
levels of her mind to the turbulent preconscious, heavily hung 
with obscuring clouds, behind 
which was the faint, quaint flicker 
of light, isolated and childlike, 
that he had grown to like. But 
that flicker of light burned with 
the hot roar of a nova. 

"Hello, Barbara. You seem 
to—" 

He was answered with a brust 
of passion that made him 
scamper. 

"Hey, Mary!" he called. "Come 
quick!" 

Mary Noyes popped out of 
the kitchen. "You in trouble, 
again?" 

"Our patient's on the mend. 
She's made contact with her Id. 
Down on the lowest level. Almost 
had my brains burned out." 

"What do you want? A chaperone ? Someone to protect the 
secrets of her sweet girlish desires?" 

"I'm the one who needs protection. Come and hold my hand." 

"You've got both of yours in 
hers." 

"Just a figure of speech." Powell glanced uneasily at the calm 
doll face before him and the cool 
relaxed hands in his. ' Come inside with me." 

He went down the black passages again toward the timeless 
reservoir of psychic energy, reasonless, remorseless, seething with 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



155 




the never-ending search for satisfaction. He could sense Mary 
Noyes cautiously following him. 
He stopped at a safe distance. 

"Hi, Barbara" 

Hatred lashed out at him. 

"You remember me?" 

The hatred subsided, to be replaced by a wave of hot desire. 

"Pres, you'd better /et. If you . 
get trapped inside that pleasurepain chaos, you're gone." 

"I'd like to locate something." 

"You cant find anything in 
there except raw love and raw 



death, pure mind/ess instinct." 

"i want her relations with her 
lather. 1 want to know why he 
had those guilt sensations about 
her." 

The furnace fumed over again. 
Mary fled. 

Puwell teetered around the edge 
of the pit like an electrician gingerly touching the ends of exposed wires. A blazing bolt 
surged near him. He stepped aside 
to feel a blanket of instinctual 
self-preservation wrap him. He 
permitted himself to be drawn

down into a vortex of associations. 

Here were tne somatic messages, cell reactions by the incredible billion, organic cries, the 
muted drone of muscle tone, sensory sub-currents, blood-flow, the 
wavering superhetrodyne of blood 
pfi . . . all whirling and churniag 
in the balancing pattern that 
formed the girl's psyche. The 
never-ending make- and -break of 
synapses contributed a crackling 
hail of complex rhythms. 

Powell caught part of Plosive 
image, followed it to the sensory association of a kiss, then 
by cross circuit to the infant's 
sucking reflex at the breast. Her 



mother? No. A wetnurse. Negation. Minus Mother. Powell 
dodged an associated flame of infantile rage and resentment, the 
Orphan's Syndrome. He searched 
for a related Pa . . . Papa . . „ 
Father. 

Abruptly he was face to face 
with his image. It was nude, powerful, its outlines haloed with an 
aura of love and desire. 

Get lost. You embarrass me. 
The image disappeared. Damn it! 
Has she fallen in love with me? 

"Hi, spook." 

There was her picture of herself, pathetically caricatured, the 
blonde hair in strings, the dark 
eyes like blotches, the lovely 
figure drawn into flat, ungracious 
planes. It faded and the image 
of Powell - Powerful - Protective Paternal rushed at him, torrentially destructive. The back of 
the head was D'Courtney's face. 
He followed the Janus image 
down to a blazing channel of 
doubles, pairs, linkages and duplicities to — yes, Ben Reich and 
the caricature of Barbara, linked 
like Siamese twins. B linked t» 
B B & B. Benedictine & Brandy. 
Barbara & Bea. 

Half— 

"Pres!" 

A call far off. directionless. It 
could wait. That amazing image 
of Reich had to —

"Mary?"

'his if the third 
d to locate you!" 
"The third time?" 
"In three hours. Please, Pres, 
while I've got the strength." 

He permitted himself to wander upward. The timeless, spaceless chaos roared around him. 
The image of Barbara D'Courtney appeared, now a caricature of 
the sexual siren. 
"Hi, spook." 

In a panic, he plunged away. 
Then the Withdrawal Technique 
went into automatic operation. 
The blocks banged down in 
steady sequence, each barrier a 
step backward toward the light. 
Halfway up, he sensed Mary 
alongside him. She stayed with 
him until he was once more in 
his living room, seated alongside 
the urchin. 

"Mary, I located the weirdest 
association with Ben Reich. Some 
kind of linkage that — " 

Mary had an iced towel. She 
shipped his face with it smartly. 
He realized that he was shaking. 

"Only trouble is you aren't
