Man of Destiny By JOHN CHRISTOPHER 


THEY clock the spaceships in 
frorn the main control tower 
seventeen miles southeast of 
Tycho. The magnesium flares blossom out against the stars and the 
searching telescopes find them and 
name them. The Elistra back from 
Procyon, the Alie Wien from Lumen III, the Winston from Sirius. 
Ships laden with passengers and 
freight from halfway across the 
visible universe, controlled corks 



bobbing up dirough the maelstrom 
of time and space to that same 
narrow arc of the lunar sky. They 
come in on time — solar time. 
There's no danger to life or goods 
or schedule. 

It wasn't always so. When the 
slip process was first being developed, there were both danger and 
uncertainty for those isolated men, 
strapped in their bubbles of metal 
and plastic, who voyaged out across 
an alien dimension to the far 
reaches of the sky. Their job was 
to take routine star pictures and 
then come back on the reverse. But 
the reverse did not always work. 
They were stranded then, hundreds 
or thousands of light-years from 
the planet they had known as 
home. 

From the moment the reverse 
failed, Theodore Pike concentrated 
on the lucky side of his situation. 
He might have been lost in the remotenesses of interstellar space, 
condemned to suffocation when his 
meager oxygen supply gave out — 
a week of waiting for death unless 
he had the courage to seek it out 
first. 

As it was, he was slap in the 
miJdle of a solar system, a matter 
of three hundred million miles 
from a blue giant. The system, as 
he had planned it for the report 
that would not now be made, was 
not of any notable size. There were 
only three planets. One was very 
large and impossibly distant from 
the sun. But there was some hope 
in the other two. In size they were 
reasonable enough. He arrowed 
down toward the first of them three 
days later; and at once set the coracle climbing up again, through a 
methane atmosphere, from a barren 
and unrewarding surface. 

That left one planet. Only one. 

When he released the hood and 
the planet's air came in, it was like 
the first time he had tasted wine, 
in the late spring at Heidelberg, 



under the gaudy cherry blossoms. 
He lifted his body clear and slid 
down the still warm metal of the 
spheroid to the mossy ground. The 
moss was dark green, and deep and 
springy. His feet went down two 
or three inches, but there was resilience even beneath that. 

He looked up at the sky. It had 
a. strange and strangely warm green 
tinge; the sun was hidden behind 
tufted blue-green clouds. He looked 
toward where it should be with 
contemptuous, good-humored acknowledgment. It had done its job; 
he was all right now. Then he 
stood easily erect beside the spheroid, watching the natives hesitantly 
approaching from the village fifty 
yards away. 

They were humanoid bipeds, 
with a natural green-tinged fur, 
but wearing artificial decorations 
and the beginnings of clothing. He 
stood quite still as they approached. 
Ten yards away, with a slow and 
somehow graceful ceremony, they 
all knelt. They rested their heads 
on the green moss. When he spoke, 
they looked up. He beckoned and 
they came closer. Their leader knelt 
again at his feet. Quite casually 
Theo put one foot on the prostrate 
head. 

It was accomplished. The natives 
had found their god. 

THE first few months passed 
very quickly. He had set himself one task — to learn the language. After that, the life of Reilly.

Things were already very pleasantThe bed made of something like 
swansdown, the spiced and delicate 
foods, the sweet yellow wine which, 
by a dispensation of Providence, 
had a far less intoxicating effect on 
him than on the natives. They goL 
drunk on it; a cheerful, happy 
drunk every seventh or eighth day. 
He was able to preside over their 
revels benignly enough, mellowed 
and happy enough himself in — as 
he reflected sardonically— his divine 
way. 

He had been figuring on a week 
of seven days and only later discovered that the natives had a ten 
month year. The four months thus 
far had been rather less than one 
of them, but at the end of that -time 
he could communicate well enough. 

He called the chief, Pernar, into 
the hut that he had once owned 
and gave the preliminary directions 
for the building of his palace. The 
natives already had fire, but had 
not applied it to the working of 
metals. He gave them that, anil the 
spoked wheel. They were enough 
to be going on with, in addition 
to the supreme, never-ending boon 
of his own personal godhead. He 
had found an outcrop of good granite, tinged with rosy green in the 
prevailing light of the planet, less 
than three miles from the village. 

The palace went up fast. He took 
it over with due ceremony. The natives were puzzled but respectful. 

That was where the settling 
down began. At one time, at the 



beginning, he had held vague hopes 
of being rescued through the slip. 
He had even planned great beacon 
towers spaced across the planet. But 
more sober reflection proved thern 
futile. Even with every imaginable 
success, the Mcndola process could 
not be studding the universe with 
ships enough to make the possibility 
of this planet's discovery more than 
fantastically remote. This was a life 
sentence. 

He had something bigger to do 
now. He would leave something 
for the exploring slip-ships to find: 
a civilization founded on a manifest divinity. At its heart a shrine, 
and in its shrine the memory of 
what Theodore Pike had made of 
his exile. 

In the eighth month of the 
planet's year, he provided the steam 
engine. 

THE natives stood around with 
their usual impeccable gravity; Pernar surrounded by his men, 
and even the bolder of the women 
and children. The tiny model 
hissed ; the small piston began to 
work the wheel. 

"In this, my people, is your future," Theo told them. "With this 
your labor will be lightened, your 
fields made fruitful. Your ships and 
wagons will cross the wide spaces 
of the world. All this your lord 
brings to his people." 

They nodded solemnly and 
bowed. The sun was at its zenith, 
where lis light concentrated into an

astonishing bluencss. Every day at 
this time the green became blue 
for an hour; by now, an ordinary 
miracle. He looked over their heads 
toward the dazzling sapphire of 
his palace. At its threshold stood 
the two gigantic replicas of his own 
image. The small white jet of steam 
climbed unwaveringly. Eventually 
there would have to be a larger 
palace, he reflected. But still here, 
in this spot, still enshrining the 
spheroid and the spot where it had 
landed. 

Who would be in it ? he wondered to himself. Me had thought 
of it before; it was his most sustaining fantasy. The great slip-ship 
settling down into this blue-green 
world, being taken (as the tradition 
would demand ) to the shrine of 
the great palace-temple, looking 
with astonishment- — and respect? 
pride?— on the first interstellar coracle, the tomb of Theodore Pike. 
What would the visitors be like? 
They would be respectful, anyway. 
They would be proud of the memory of the first of their line. His 
name would leap through the vast 
gulfs that now cut him off from 
all his youth might have enjoyed. 
That made up for everything. 

'But everything was quite a lot. 

FOLLOWING Theo's demonstration, the natives seemed in 
no hurry to adopt the steam engine. 
Every now and then the elders 
would come to watch the little 
model putting away. Theo explained 



it to them several times, and they 
nodded their heads in respectful 
approval. But all their working 
time now was being devoted to the 
harvest. The whole tribe — men, 
women, children — toiled in the 
fields through the long hot days. 

Even in his natural indolence he 
was aware of a sense of urgency 
about their labor; they worked on 
their holiday now, only getting 
drunk when the green twilight had 
darkened into night. He had the 
shrewd sense not to interfere. A 
natural rhythm of the tribe, he 
guessed, best modified by the fundamental change in environment 
which his technology would inevitably create. 

He went out into the fields one 
d ay to watch them . Pernar, the 
chief, was sweating with the rest. 
Theo lay back in the springy moss 
and watched them. He noticed idly 
that the wagons carrying produce — 
mounted now on his wheels, the 
old crude wooden skids having 
been discarded — did not go back 
to the village, but away up the 
slope, in the opposite direction. He 
asked Pernar why. 

Pernar explained, "Against the 

Time, Lord." 
"The time?" 

Pern ar paused for a momen t, 
fumbling. At last he used a word 
Theo had not heard before. 

"Whafs that?" 

Pernar said awkwardly, "The 
wild air . . . the water." 

A rainy season! Theo undcr

stood. It was reasonable enough 
that the harvest had to be in before the rains came. But that didn't 
explain the wagons trekking away 
uphill. He asked Pernar again. 

"At the Time, we retreat. It is 
necessary." 

"Necessary" was a common and 
useful word in the vocabulary of 
the natives, it stood for anything 
they were ' in the habit of doing. 
Eventually he would do something 
about it himself. But now it was 
pleasant enough to lie back in the 
green moss and watch his people 
going about their business. Let this 
coming rainy season pass in the 
usual way; next year he would 
really get down to pouring them 
into his mold — into the necessary 
mold for the empire that he would 
build and leave as his record to 
those ships a thousand years in the 
future. 

THE sky thickened into cloud 
over a period of several days; 
from thin twists and strands low 
on the horizon to ropes and 
bunched masses, and, finally, a universal, paralyzing gray. Two days 
after this unbroken canopy had 
settled over them, Pernar came to 
him in the palace. 

"Lord, it is the Time." 
Theo said, "How long will your 
people be gone?" 

Pernar was startled. "You are 
not coming with us, Lord?" 

"For you in your huts, the retreat may be necessary; these gran


ite walls are protection enough 
against the wild air. In other years, 
you, too, will have refuges like this. 
Go in peace now." 

Pernar nodded reluctantly. "Your 
other servants, Lord . . . 

He was referring to the personal 
servants who attended the god-king 
in his palace. 

"They will be safe hecc," Theo 
said. 

"They will not stay. Lord. They 
dare not stay." 

The best argument, Theo realized, was acquiescence. When they 
returned to find the palace still 
standing beside the storm-blasted 
huts of the village, that would be 
the real conviction. He said simply, 
"Let food and drink be made ready. 
For how long?" 

"Two weeks." 

"Two weeks, then." 

He was aware of loneliness when 
the last of them had gone, up the 
rising ground to whatever ritual 
refuge they used against the storms. 
Now once more he was conscious 
of his isolation, cut off from his 
own people by uncountable galactic 
miles, by the long sweep of time 
itself. Only the realization of destiny made the future seem worth 
while. He was pleased, in a way, 
when the rising wind began to 
howl about the village. The savageness of the elements gave him 
something to measure himself 
against. 

But he was not prepared for the 
fury that developed. The storm

129 



rose from climax to climax; rain 
belted down torrentially from the 
nging skies. On the third day it 
rose to hurricane force. 

From an embrasure slit, he 
watched the pitiful native huts torn 
from their moorings and flung like 
tattered leaves about the swirling 
sky. It seemed impossible that there 
could be more violence, but more 
came. The air shrieked in protest, 
a high-pitched wail under the constant lash. Theo watched it in 
amazement. 

He was more amazed still when 
Pemar came to him, drenched and 
battered from his voyage through 
the storm. 

"You must come. Lord." 

"Into that?" He pointed out into 
the storm. "You'd better stay here 
yourself now." 

"The water . . . the water that 
rises." 

"Floods? This place is high 
enough. We're all right here." 

"You must come, Lord." 

The argument between them 
went on as the late afternoon 
passed into night. And with nightfall, astonishingly, the rain stopped 
and the gale dropped. Theo said to 
Pcrnar triumphantly, "You see?" 

For answer Pernar insisted on 
dragging him outside into the open. 
The ground was soggy underfoot; 
the mashed remains of the huts lay 
before them. Pcrnar pointed. On 
the far horizon a glow became increasingly brilliant against the thinning clouds. The cloud strands 



twisted and broke, and, in the interval of clear sky, he saw it. 

A moon. A giant, gibbous moon 
poised above the skyline like a 
grinning skull. 

But how? He knew this planet 
had no satellite. 

When he considered things, it 
was obvious enough. One of the 
other two planets in the system, 
almost certainly the nearer one, with 
the methane atmosphere, was eccentrically orbited. It was this the natives measured their year by — -the 
regular approach and the attendant 
perturbations. All their life, inevitably, must be regulated by it. 

Pcrnar said, "The rising water, 
Lord ..." 

He understood that, too. With 
one last glance at his sand-castle 
palace, he said, "Let's go." 

THE refuge was under the rocky 
knob of the hill's carapace, a 
natural cave hollowed, out and improved by the work of generations. 
They arrived there with less than 
an hour to spare. Theo watched, 
with Pernar and the others, the 
brilliant globe that put out the 
light of the usual stars in a sky now 
clear and unclouded again. And he 
watched the tidal wave surge like 
a moving mountain of water to 
within twenty feet of where they 
crouched. 

Watching it lap the land, almost 
at their feet, he considered the kind 
of courage that could have made 
Pernar go down into that doomed 



no 




 



valley to rescue him. Nor was it 
any easily dismissed compulsion of 
religion. He had been fooling himself about that. You did not rescue 
a god from the consequences of his 
folly. 

They were a peaceable and docile 
people. They had accepted his commands and they had given him service; if he wanted to be a god, they 
were willing to let him. But they 
weren't his subjects or his disciples. 
More important than ■those things, 
they were his friends. 

There was still much he could 
give them, but more, he suspected, 
that they would give him. 

Finding himself not a god was 
a relief, somehow. It was less of a 
strain to be human and fallible. 

THE floods receded, and the tribe 
moved again into the valley. 
As the great blue sun burned the 
water out of the steaming soil, they 
set to work to plant the seeds again 
and to rebuild the vanished huts. 

Theo worked with them. He 
found an unexpected satisfaction 
in these labors, and an increasingly 
deeper realization of the nobility 
of these creatures who seemed to 
be without even the slightest trace 
of mutual hostility or anger. They 
accepted his working wivh them in 
the fields as casually is they had 
previously accepted his overlordship; the difference was that now 
he was one of them and wanted 
no more than the awareness of that 
oneness. 



Sometimes, especially when he 
passed the broken and scattered 
stone of what had been his palace, 
he remembered the world he had 
Lome from, and that great ship that 
— in a hundred years, a thousand, 
a hundred thousand — might drop 
through the- green glow of rhc sky. 

But the memory and the thought 
were tinged with fear. Fear of any■Uiing that might tome to disrupt 
'the beauty and peace of this undemanding life. 

When the planting was over, 
there was the season of recreation. 
They danced, supple, graceful, unhurried dances, to the music of 
flutelike instruments; and chanted 
poems whose tenderness he understood more clearly as his mind 
grew more at home in their liquid 
but sinewy tongue. 

Day after day, week after -week. 
Work and rest and laughter and 
song. Where he had once asked for 
worship, he found himself almost 
reverent. 

He had not guessed there could 
be such joy in humility. 

When he died, twenty of the 
planets years later, he had been 
their loved and respected chief for 
nearly fifteen years. Only you 
couldn't call it chief, nor had lie 
done so. 

They buried him in his former 
palace, which had gradually become 
a mausoleum. His last request was 
to have the steam engine buried 
with him.
