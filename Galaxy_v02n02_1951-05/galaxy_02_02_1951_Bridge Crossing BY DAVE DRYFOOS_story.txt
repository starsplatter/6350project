Bridge Crossing BY DAVE DRYFOOS 


IN 1849, the mist that sometimes rolled through the Golden Gate was known as fog. 
In 2149, it had become far more 
frequent, arid was known as smog. 
By 2349. it was fog again. 

But tonight there was smoke 
mixed with the fog. Roddie could 
smell it. Somewhere En the forested 
ruins, ftre was burning. 

He wasn't worried. Hie small 
blaze that smoldered behind him 
on the cracked concrete floor had 
consumed everything burnable 
within blocks; what remained of 
the gutted concrete office building 
from which he peered was fireproof. 

But Roddie was himself aflame 
with anger. As always when Invaders broke in from the north, 
he'd been left behind with his 
nurse, Molly, while the soldiers 
went out to fight. 

And nowadays Molly's presence 
wasn't the comfort it used to be. 
He felt almost ready to jump out 
of his skin, the way she rocked and 
knitted in that grating ruined chair, 
saying over and over again, "The 
soldiers don't want little boys. The 
soldiers don't want little boys. The 
soldiers don't — " 

"I'm not a little boy!" Roddie 
suddenly shouted. "I'm full-grown 
and I've never even seen an Invader. Why won't you let me go 
and fight?" 

Fiercely he crossed the bare, 
gritty floor and shook Molly's 
shoulder. She rattled under his jarring hand, and abruptly changed 
the subject. 

"A is for Atom, B is for Bomb, 
C is for Corpse -" she chanted. 

Roddie reached into her shapeless dress and pinched. Lately that 
had helped her over these spells. 
But this time, though it stopped 
the kindergarten song, the treatment 
only started something worse. 

" Wuzzums hungry?" Molly 
cooed, still rocking. 

Utterly disgusted, Roddie ripped 
her head off her neck. 

It was a completely futile gesture. The complicated mind that had 

6 



cared for him and taught him 
speech and the alphabet hadn't 
made him a mechanic, and his 
only tool was a broken-handled 
screwdriver. 

HE WAS still tinkering when 
the soldiers came in. While 
they lined up along the wall, he 
put Molly's head back on her neck.' 

She gaped coyly at the new 
arrivals. "Hello, boys," she simpered. "Looking for a good time?" 

Roddie slapped her to silence, 
reflecting briefly that there were 
many things he didn't know about 
Molly. But there was work to be 
done. Carefully he framed the ritual 
words she'd taught him: "Soldiers, 
come to attention and report!" 

There were eleven of them, six 
feel tall, with four limbs and eight 
extremities. They stood uniformly, 
the thumbs on each pair of hands 
touching along the center line of 
the legs, front feet turned out at 
an angle of forty-five degrees, rear 
feet turned inward at thirty degrees. 

"Sir," they chorused, "we have 
met the enemy and he is ours." 

He inspected them. All were 
scratched and dented, but -one in 
particular seemed badly damaged. 
His left arm was almost severed 
at the shoulder. 

"Come here, fellow," Roddie 
said. "Let's see if I can fix that." 

The soldier took a step forward, 
lurched suddenly, stopped, and 
whipped out a bayonet. 


 



"Death to Invaders!" lie yelled, 
and charged crazily. 

Molly stepped in front of him. 

"You aren't being very nice to 
my baby," she murmured, and 
thrust her knitting needles into his 
eyes. 

Roddie jumped behind him, 
knocked off his helmet, and pressed 
a soft spot on his conical skull. 
The soldier collapsed to the floor. 

RODDIE salvaged and returned 
Molly's needles. Then he examined the patient, tearing him apart 
as a boy dismembers an alarm clock. 

It was lucky he did. The left 
arm's pair of hands suddenly 
writhed off the floor in an effort 
to choke him. But because the arm 
was detached at the shoulder and 
therefore blind, he escaped the 
clutching onslaught and could goad 
the reflexing hands into assaulting 
one another harmlessly. 

Meanwhile, the other soldiers 
left, except for one, apparently another casualty, who stumbled on 
his way out and fell into the fire. 
By the time Roddie had hauled 
him clear, damage was beyond repair. Roddie swore, then decided 
to try combining parts of this casualty with pieces" of the other to 
make a whole one. 

To get more light for the operation, he poked up the fire. Roddie 
was new at his work, and took it 
seriously. It alarmed him to watch 
the soldiers melt away, gradually 
succumbing to battle damage, 



shamed him to see the empty ruins 
burn section by section as the Invaders repeatedly broke through 
and had to be burned out. 

Soon there would be nothing 
left of the Private Properly Keep 
Out that, according to Molly's bedtime story, the Owners had entrusted to them when driven away 
by radioactivity. Soon the soldiers 
themselves would be gone. None 
would remain to guard the city but 
a few strayed servants like Molly, 
and an occasional Civil Defender. 

And himsel f, Roddie reflected, 
spitting savagely into the fire. He 
might remain. But how he fitted 
into the picture, he didn't know. 
And Molly, who claimed to have 
found him in the ruins after a 
fight with Invaders twenty years 
before, couldn't or wouldn't say. 

Well, for as long as possible, 
Roddie decided, he'd do his duty 
as the others did theirs — singlcmindcdly. Eventually the soldiers 
might accept him as one of themselves; meanwhile, this newly attempted first aid was useful to 
them. 

He gave the fire a final poke and 
then paused, wondering if, when 
heated, his screwdriver could make 
an unfastened end of wire stick on 
the grayish spot where it seemed 
to belong. 

Stretching prone to blow the embers hot so he could try out his 
new idea, Roddie got too close to 
the flames. Instantly the room 
filled with the stench of singed

hair. Roddie drew angrily back, 
beating out the sparks in his uncut 
blond mane. 

As he stood slapping his head 
and muttering, a deranged Civil 
Defense firefighter popped into the 
doorway and covered, him with 
carbon dioxide foam. 

Roddie fled. His life-long friends 
were not merely wearing out, they 
were unbearably wearing. 

IN THE street, even before he'd 
wiped off the foam, he regretted his flight. The fire was back 
home. And here in the cold of this 
fog-shrouded canyon, a mere trail 
between heaped-up walls of rubble, 
the diaper he wore felt inadequate 
against the pre-dawn. cold. His 
cherished weapon, a magnetic tackhammer, was chill beneath die 
diaper's top, and the broken, radium-dialed wristwatch suspended 
from a string around his neck hung 
clammy against his chest. He stood 
irresolute on numbing bare feet, 
and considered returning to the 
more familiar bedlam. 

But colder than cold was his 
shame at being cold. Molly never 
was, though she knew how to keep 
him warm, nor were the others. 
Hunger, thirst, pain and coldness 
were sensations never experienced 
by his friends. Like the growth he'd 
been undergoing till recently, these 
were things of ignominy, to be 
hidden as far as possible from inquiring eyes. Cold as it was, he'd 
have to hide. 



Temporarily, the darkness concealed him, though it was not quite 
complete. From above the fog. the 
moon played vaguely deceptive light 
on the splinters of architecture 
looming toward it. Some distance 
off, an owl hooted, but here nocturnal rodents felt free to squeak 
and rustle as they scampered. 

The world seemed ghostly. Yet 
it wasn't dead; it merely lurked. 
And as an irrepressible yawn reminded Roddie of his absurd need 
for sleep even in the midst of 
danger, he concluded for the 
thousandth time that die One 
who'd built him must have been an 
apprentice. 

For just such reasons he'd developed the hideout toward which 
he now walked. It had been the 
haven of his adolescence, when the 
discovery of how much he differed 
from his friends had been a shock, 
and the shock itself a difference to 
be hidden. 

His hiding place was a manhole, 
dead center in the dead street. A 
weathered bronze bar, carefully 
placed in the cover's slotted rim, 
was the levering key that opened 
its door. 

Everything was wrong tonight? 
He couldn't even find the bar. Of 
course that spoiled things, because 
the bar was a roller on which to 
move the heavy cover from below, 
and a support that held it ajar for 
ventilation. 

But the example of his friends 
had taught him above all else to 



3 




 



carry oul every purpose. Molly was 
a nurse; she had raised him despite 
all obstacles. The soldiers were 
guards; they protected the ruins 
against everything larger than a 
rat. The firefighter had put even 
him out when he was aflame . , . 

Anyhow, the manhole cover had 
been loosened by his frequent handling. He lifted it aside by main 
strength, then flattened himself to 
the street, and felt with his feet for 
the top rung. 

Halfway down the iron ladder, 
sometliing made him pause. He 
looked, but saw only blackness. He 
listened, sniffed, found nothing. 
What could have entered through 
the iron cover? 

He sneered at his own timidity 
and jumped to the bottom. 

It was warm ! The dry bottom of 
the hole had the temperature of 
body heat, as if a large animal had 
recently rested there! 

QUICKLY, Roddie drew the 
hammer from his waist. Then, 
with weapon ready for an instantaneous blow, he stretched his left 
hand through the darkness. He 
touched something warm, softish. 
Gingerly he felt over that curving 
surface for identifying features. 

While Roddie investigated by 
touch, his long fingers were suddenly seized and bitten. At the 
same time, his right shin received 
a savage kick. And his own retaliatory blow was checked in midswing by an unexpected voice. 



"Get your filthy hands off me!" 
it whispered angrily. "Who do you 
think you are?" 

Startled, he dropped his hammer. "I'm Roddie," he said, squatting to fumble for it. "Who do you 
think you are?" 

"I'm Ida, naturally ! Just how 
many girls are there in this raiding 
party?" 

His first Invader — and he had 
dropped his weapon! 

Scrabbling fearfully in the dust 
for his hammer, Roddie paused 
suddenly. This girl — whatever that 
was — seemed to think him one of 
her own kind. There was a chance, 
not much, but worth taking, to 
turn delay to advantage. Maybe he 
could learn something of value before he killed her. That would 
make the soldiers accept him! 

He stalled, seeking a gambit. 
"How would I know how many 
girls there are?" 

Half expecting a blow, he got 
instead an apology. "I'm sorry," 
the girl said. "I should have known. 
Never even heard your name before, either. Roddie . . . Whose 
boat did you come in, Roddie?" 

Boat? What was a boat? "How 
would I know?" he repeated, voice 
tight with fear of discovery. 

If she noticed the tension, she 
didn't show it. Certainly her whisper was friendly enough. "Oh, 
you're one of the fellows from 
Bodega, then. They shoved a boy 
into our boat at die last minute, 
too. Tough, wasn't it, getting sep

.i rated in the fog and tide like that? 
If only we didn't 'have to use 
boats . . . But, say, how are we 
going to get away from here?" 

"I wouldn't know," Roddie said, 
closing his fingers on the hammer, 
and rising. "How did you get in?" 

"Followed your footprints. It was 
sundown and I saw human tracks 
in the dust and they led me here. 
Where were you?" 

"Scouting around," Roddie said 
vaguely. ' ' H ow d i d you kn ow I 
was a man when I came back?" 

"Because you couldn't see me, 
silly ! You know perfectly welt 
these androids are heat-sensitive and 
can locate us in the dark!" 

Indeed he did know ! Many times 
he'd felt ashamed that Molly could 
find him whenever she wanted to, 
even here in the manhole. But perhaps the manhole would help him 
now to redeem himself . . . 

"T'D LIKE .to get a look at you," 
J. he said. 

The girl laughed self-consciously. 
"It's getting gray out. You'll see 
me soon enough." 

But she'd see him, Roddie realized. He had to talk fast. 

"What'll we do when it's light?" 
he asked. 

"Well, I guess the boats have 
gone," Ida said. "You could swim 
the Gate, I gu es s — yoi i seem ta 1 1 
and strong enough. But I couldn't. 
You'll think it's crazy, but I've 
given this some thought, and even 
looked it over from the other side. 



I expect to try the Golden Gate 
Bridge!" 

Now he was getting somewhere! 
The bridge was ruined, impassable. 
Even her own people had crossed 
the Strait by other means. But if 
there were a way over the bridge . . . 

"It's broken," he said. "How in 
the world can we cross it?" 

"Oh, you'll find out, if you take 
me up there. I — I don't want to be 
alone, Roddie. Will you go with 
me? Now?" 

Well, she could be made to point 
out the route before he killed her 
— if nothing happened when she 
saw him. 

Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand. 

A giggle broke the pause. "It's 
nice of you to wait and let me go 
first up the ladder," the girl said. 
"But where the heck is the rusty 
old thing?" 

"I'll go first," said Roddie. He 
might need the advantage. "The 
ladder's right behind fne." 

He climbed with hammer in 
teeth, and stretched his left hand 
from street level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously fingering his weapon, he 
stared at her in the thin gray dawn. 

She was short and lean, except 
for roundnesses here and there. 
From her shapeless doeskin dress 
stretched slender legs that tapered 
to feet that were bare, tiny, and, 
like her hands, only two in number. 

Roddie was pleased. They were 
evenly matched as to members, and 



10 




 



that would make things easy when 
the time came. 

He looked into 'her face. It 
smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, 
with a full mouth and bright dark 
eyes that hid under long lashes 
when he looked too long. 

Startling, -those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a 
rush of fear, but she gave his hand 
a squeeze before twisting loose, and 
burst into sudden laughter. 

"Diapers!" she chortled, snuggling to keep her voice low. "My 
big, strong, blond and blue-eyed 
hero goes into battle wearing 
diapers, and carrying only a hammer to light with! You're the most 
unforgettable character I have ever 
known !" 

He'd passed inspection, then — 
so far. He expelled his withheld 
breath, and said, "I think you'll 
find me a little odd, in some ways." 

"Oh, not at all," Ida replied 
quickly. "Different, yes, but I 
wouldn't say odd." 

WHEN they started down the 
street, she was nervous despite Roddie's assertion that heknew where the soldiers were posted. He wondered if she felt some 
of the doubt he'd tried to conceal, 
shared his visions of what the soldiers might do if they found him 
brazenly strolling with an Invader. 
They might not believe he was 
only Questioning a prisoner. 

Every day, his friends were becoming more unpredictable. 



For that very reason, because he 
didn't know what precautions 
would do any good, he took a 
chance and walked openly to the 
bridge by the most direct route. In 
time this apparent assurance stilled 
Ida's fears, and she began to talk. 

Many of the things she said 
were beyond his experience and 
mean ing 1 ess to him, but he did 
note with interest how effective the 
soldiers had been. 

"It's awful," Ida said. "So few 
young men are left, so many casualties. . . . 

"But why do you — we — keep up 
the light?" Roddie asked. "I mean, 
the soldiers will never leave the 
city; their purpose is to guard it 
and they can't leave, so they won't 
attack. Let them alone, and there'll 
be plenty of young men." 

"Well!" said Ida, sharply. "You 
need indoctrination! Didn't they 
ever tell you that the city is our 
home, even if the stupid androids 
do keep us out? Don't you know 
how dependent we are on these 
raids for all our tools and things?" 

She sounded suspicious. Roddie 
shot her a furtive, startled glance. 
But she wasn't standing off to fight 
him. On the contrary, she was too 
close for both comfort and combat. She bumped him hip and 
shoulder every few steps, and if he 
edged away, she followed. 

He went on with his questioning. 
"Why are you here? I mean, sure, 
the others arc after tools ami 
things, but what's your purpose?"

Ida shrugged. "I'll admit no girl 
has ever done it before," she Slid, 
"but I thought I could help with 
the wounded. That's why I have no 
weapon." 

She hesitated, glanced covertly up 



concrete foundations on the northern end of the city. Thick fog over 
the water hid Alcatraz, but in-shore 
visibility was better, and they could 
see the beginning of the bridge 
approach. 




at him, and went on with a rush 
of words. "It's .the lack of men, I 
guess. All the girls are kind of 
bored and hopeless, so I got this 
bright idea and stowed away on 
one. of the boats when it was dark 
and the fog had settled down. Do 
you diink I was being silly?" 

"No, but you do seem a little 
purposeless." 

In silence they trudged through 
a vast area of charred wood and 



A stone rattled nearby. There 
was a clink of metal. Ida gasped, 
and clung to Roddie's arm. 

"Behind me !" he whispered 
urgently. "Get behind me and hold 
on!" 

He felt Ida's arms encircling his 
waist, her chin digging into his 
back below the left shoulder. Facing them, a hundred feet away, 
stood a soldier. He looked contemptuous, hostile.

"It's all right," Roddie said, his 
voice breaking. 

There was a long, sullen, heartstopping stare. Then the soldier 
turned and walked away. 

Ida's grip loosened, and he could 
feel her sag behind him. Roddie 
turned and held her. With eyes 
closed, she pressed cold blue lips 
to his. He grimaced and turned 
away his head. 



Ida's response was quick. "Forgive me," she breathed, and 
slipped from his arms, but she held 
herself erect "I was so scared. "And 
then we've had no sleep, no food 
or water." 

Roddie was familiar with these 
signs of weakness, proud of appearing to deny his own humiliating 
needs. 

"I guess you're not as strong as 



BRIDGE CROSSING 



13 



me," he said smugly. "I'll take care 
of you. Of course we can't sleep 
now, -but I'll get food and water." 

Leaving her to follow, he turned 
left to the ruins of a supermarket 
he had previously visited, demonstrating his superior strength by 
setting a pace Ida couldn't match. 
By the time she caught up with 
him, he had grubbed out a few 
cans of the special size that Molly 
always chose. Picking two that were 
neither dented, swollen, nor rusted, 
he smashed an end of each with 
his hammer, and gave Ida her choice 
of strained spinach or squash. 

"Baby food !' ' she muttered. 
"Maybe it's just what we need, but 
to eat baby food with a man wearing a diaper . . . Tell me, Roddic, 
how did you happen to know where 
to find it?" 

"Well, this Is the northern end 
of the city," he answered, shrugging. "I've been here before." 

"Why did the soldier let us go?" 

"This watch," he said, touching 
the radium dial. "It's a talisman." 

But Ida's eyes had widened, and 
the color was gone from her face. 
She was silent, too, except when 
asking him to fill his fast-emptied 
can with rain-water. She didn't 
finish her own portion, but lay back 
in the rubble with feet higher than 
her head, obviously trying to renew her strength. 

And when they resumed their 
walk, her sullen, fear-clouded face 
showed plainly that he'd given himself away. 



But to kill her now, before learning how she planned to cross the 
supposedly impassable bridge, 
seemed as purposeless and impulsive as Ida herself. Roddic didn't 
think, in any case, that her death 
would satisfy the soldiers. With 
new and useful information to 
offer, he might join them as an 
equal at last. But if his dalliance 
with this enemy seemed pointless, 
not even Molly's knitting needles 
could protect him. 

He was sure the soldiers must 
be tracking the mysterious emanations of his watch dial, and had 
trouble to keep from glancing over 
his shoulder at every step. But 
arrival at the bridge approach ended the need for this self-restraint. 
Here, difficult going demanded 
full attention. 

HE'D never gone as far as the 
bridge before, not having 
wanted to look as if he might be 
leaving the city. The approach was 
a jungle of concrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-stecl that 
reached for the unwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to 
balance on cracked girders, and inch 
over roadless spots high off the 
ground. 

Here Ida took the lead. When 
they got to where three approach 
roads made a clover-leaf, she led 
him down a side road and into a 
forest. 

Roddic stopped, and seized her 
arm.

"Whit ate you trying to do?" he 
demanded. 

"I'm taking you with me," Ida 
said firmly. "Taking you where 
you belong!" 

"No!" he blurted, drawing his 
hammer. "I can't go, nor let you 
go. I belong here!" 

Ida gasped, twisted loose, and 
ran. Roddie ran after her. 

She wasn't so easily caught. Like 
a frightened doc, she dashed in and 
out among the trees, leaped to the 
bridge's underpinnings where they 
thrust rustedly from a cliff, and 
scrambled up the ramp. 

Roddie sighed and slowed down. 
The pavement ended just beyond 
the cable anchors. From there to 
the south lower, only an occasional 
dangling support wire showed 
where the actual bridge had been 
suspended. Ida was trapped. 

He could take his 'time. Let the 
soldiers come up, as they undoubtedly would, to finish the job . . . 

But Ida didn't seem to realize she 
was trapped. Without hesitation 
she dashed up the main left-hand 
suspension cable and ran along its 

carved steel surface. 

For a moment, Roddie thought 
of letting her go, letting her run 
up the evcr-stecpcning catenary 
until — because there were no guardropes or handgrips — she simply 
fell. That would solve his problem. 

Except it wouldn't be bis solution. Her death wouldn't prove him 
to his friends. 

He set out quickly, before Ida 



was lost to sight in. the thick 
that billowed in straight from the 
OCean, At first he ran crcit along 
the top of the yard-wide cylinder 
of twisted metal, but soon the curve 
steepened, He had to go on all 
fours, clinging palm and sole. 

Blood was on the cable where 
she'd passed. More blood stained 
it when he'd followed. 

But because his friends knew 
neither pain nor fatigue, Roddie 
would admit none either. Nor 
would he give in to the fear that 
dizzied him at every downward 
look. He scrambled on like an automaton, watching only his holds, 
till he rammed Ida's rear with his 
head. 

SHE had stopped, trembling and 
gasping. Roddie clung just below her and looked dazedly around. 
There was nothing in sight but fog, 
pierced by die rapier of rusted wire 
supporting them. Neither end of 
it was in sight. 

Upward lay success, if death were 
not nearer on the cable. No soldier 
had ever come even this far, for 
soldiers, as he'd told Ida, never 
left the city, were not built to do 
so. Bui be was here; widi luck, he 
could capitalize on the differences 
that had plagued him so long. 

"Go on!" he ordered hoarsely. 
"Move!" 

There was neither answer nor 
result. He broke off an end of 
loosened wire and jabbed her rear, 
Ida gasped and crawled on.

Up and up they went, chilled, 
wot, bleeding, pain-racked, exhausted. Never had Roddie felt so 
thoroughly the defects of his peculiar nun-mechanical construction. 

Without realizing it, he acquired 
a new purpose, a duty as compelling 
as that of any soldier or firewatcher. He had to keep that trembling body of his alive, mount to 
the tall rust tower overhead. 

He climbed and he made Ida 
climb, till, at nightmare's end, the 
fog thinned and they tame into 
clear, windswept air and clawed up 
the last hundred feet to sanctuary. 

They were completely spent. 
Without word or thought they crept 
within the tower, huddled together 
for warmth on its dank steel deck, 
and slept for several hours. 

RODDIE awoke as Ida finished 
Struggling free of his unconscious grip. Limping, he joined her 
painful walk around the tower. 
From its openings they looked out 
on a strange and isolated world. 

To the north, where Ida seemed 
drawn as though by instinct, Mount 
Tamalpais reared its brushy head, 
a looming island above a billowy 
white sea of fog. To the south 
were the Twin Peaks, a pair of 
buttons on a cotton sheet. Eastward 
lay Mount Diablo, bald and brooding, tallest of the peaks and most 
forbidding. 

But westward over the ocean lay 
the land of gold — of all the kinds 
of gold there are, from brightest 



yellow to deepest orange. Only a 
small portion of the setting sun 
glared above the fog-bank; the rest 
seemed to have been broken off and 
smeared around by a child In love 
with its color. 

Fascin ated , Rodd ie stared for 
minutes, but turned when Ida 
showed no interest. She was intent 
on the tower itself. Following her 
eyes, Roddie saw his duty made 
suddenly clear. 

Easy to make out even in the 
fading light was the route by which 
Invaders could cross to the foot of 
this tower on the remaining ruins 
of the road, climb to where he now 
stood, and then descend the cable 
over the bridge's gap and catch the 
city unaware. Easy to estimate was 
the advantage of even this perilous 
route over things that scattered on 
the water and prevented a landing 
in strength. Easy to see was the 
need to kill Ida before she carried 
home this knowledge. 

Roddie took the hammer from 
his waist. 

"Don't! Oh, don't!" Ida 
screamed. " She burst into tears and 
covered her face with scratched and 
bloodied hands. 

Surprised, Roddie withheld the 
blow. He had wept, as .a child, and, 
weeping, had for the first time 
learned he differed from his 
friends. Ida's tears disturbed him, 
bringing unhappy memories. 

"Why should you cry?" toe 
asked comfortingly. "You know 
your people will come back to 



16 




 



avenge you and will destroy my 
friends." 

"But — but my people are your 
people, -too," Ida wailed. "It's so 
senseless, now, after all our 
struggle to escape. Don't you see? 
Your friends are only machines, 
built by our ancestors. We arc Men 
—and the city is ours, not theirs!" 

"It can't be," Roddie objected. 
"The city surely belongs to those 
who are superior, and my friends 
are superior to your people, even 
to me. Each of us has a purpose, 
though, while you Invaders seem 
to be aimless. Each of us helps preserve the city; you only try to rob 
and end it by destroying it. My people must be the true Men, because 
they" re so much more rational than 
yours . . . And it isn't rational to 
let you escape." 

Ida had turned up her tearstreaked face to stare at him. 

"Rational! What's rational about 
murdering a defenseless girl in cold 
blood? Don't you realize we're the 
same sort of being, we two? Don't 
—don't you remember how we've 
been with each other all day?" 

She paused. Roddie noticed that 
her eyes were dark and frightened, 
yet somehow soft, over scarlet 
cheeks. He had to look away. But 
he said nothing. 

"Never mind!" Ida said viciously. "You can't make me beg. Go 
ahead and kill — see if it proves 
you're superior. My people will take 
over the city regardless of you and 
me, and regardless of your jumping


jack friends, too! Men can accomplish anything!" 

SCORNFULLY she turned and 
looked toward the western twilight. It was Roddie's turn to stand 
and stare. 

"Purpose!" Ida flung at him over 
her shoulder. "Logic! Women hear 
so much of that from men! You're 
a man, all right! Men always call 
it logic when they want to destroy ! 
Loyalty to your own sort, kindness, 
affection — all emotional, aren't 
they? Not a bit logical. Emotion 
is for creatimg, and it's so much 
more logical to destroy, isn't 

it?" 

She whirled back toward him, 
advancing as if she wanted to sink 
her teeth into his throat. "Go 
ahead. Get it over with — if you 
have the courage." 

It was hard for Roddie to look 
away from that wrath -c r i msoned 
face, but it was even harder to keep 
staring into the blaze of her eyes. 
He compromised by gazing Out an 
opening at the gathering dusk. He 
thought for a long time before he 
decided to tuck his hammer away. 

"It isn't reasonable to kill you 
now," he said. "Too dark. You 
can't possibly get down that halfruined manway tonight, so let's see 
how I feel in the morning." 

Ida began to weep again, and 
Roddie found it necessary to comfort her. 

And by morning he knew he was 
a Man.
