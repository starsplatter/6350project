Simpson 

By PHILIP LATHAM 




RAWLINS found Linda in the 
transmitting room giving 
some last-minute instructions to 
the chief engineer. Considering 
that they were discussing the details of an invasion that might 
change the course of events within the solar system, they appeared remarkably calm. 

"I think we'll drop the artificial flowers first," Linda said 



studying the schedule in her 
hand. "They should have a reassuring effect, don't you think? 
Let the Venusians know we're 
nice people." 

"Drop artificial flowers first," 
the engineer repeated, writing it 
down. 

"Next will come the vitamin 
candy bars. Now, we don't have 
so very many of them, so be sure 



I

and wait till we're over the city 
before you start strewing them 
around." 

"You know, those candy bars 
worry me," the engineer said. "If 
one of them ever hits a Venusian 
it wiil knock him cold sure." 

Linda's smile might have been 
meant for a five-year-old child. 
"Mr. Simpson has taken care to 
have each candy bar equipped 
with its own individual parachute. That's the reason we nave 
so few of them." 

"I just wondered," the engineer returned. 

"Then after the candy bars 
we'll start dropping the photographs of Simpson himself. The 
one with the big smile and both 
hands outstretched." 

"Okay," the engineer told 
her. He closed his notebook with 
a snap. "How soon do we roll?" 

"That will depend upon Mr. 
Simpson. Right after the broadcast probably." 

"Incidentally, where is the 
chief?" Rawlins inquired. "I 
haven't seen him for the last 
hour." 

Linda consulted her wristwatch. "Right now Mr. Simpson is taking his Swedish exercises. In another five minutes he 
will be getting his rubdown. In 
another ten minutes — " 

"Good lord! Doesn't he ever 
pass up that routine of his? Even 
when there's an invasion on?" 



"Success is attained through 
the persistent application of 
right habits of thought and living. A sound mind in a sound 
body, for instance." 

"Oh, yeah?" 

Rawlins knew it wasn't good, 
but it was the best he could do 
at the moment. He sauntered 
over to the window, where he 
stood staring down at the pale 
lemon tinted disk of Venus. 

"Well, buzz me when you're 
ready," the engineer said. "I'll 
be down in the astrolab counting the minutes." 

Silence descended upon the 
transmitting room. Linda continued checking her schedule. 
Rawlins maintained his moody 
contemplation of Venus. The 
planet was growing larger with 
uncomfortable rapidity. They 
were so close now that the billowy character of the cloud layer 
was clearly evident above the 
saffron level beneath. The white 
tufts reminded him of the whipped cream on his mother's pineapple layer cake. His stomach 
ulcers twinged feebly. 

"Of all the crazy ideas I ever 
fell for, this is the worst," he 
muttered. "Shipping on an invasion of Venus as a public opinion expert." 

"What's so crazy about that?" 
Linda remarked, deftly clipping 
two pages together. "How can 
we expect to govern this planet

efficiently unless we know what 
its inhabitants are thinking 
about?" 

Rawlins regarded her with 
distinct distaste. It irked him 
that any girl as pretty and feminine as Linda King should be so 
utterly absorbed in the affairs of 
J. Danforth Simpson. What she 
needed was waiting up. A female 
robot with green eyes and chestnut hair. 

"But a people like the 
Venusians," he said. "From 
what I hear they're still practically in the figleaf stage. To say 
nothing of being mostly women." 

"Is that bad? The part about 
being women, I mean?" 

"Well, it's not exactly good 
when it comes to sampling. The 
trouble with women is they 
aren't satisfied with just answering your questions. They 
want to pour out their whole 
life story besides." 

Linda sniffed. "If you're going 
to work for Mr. Simpson then 
I suggest you get busy devising 
a suitable polling technique for 
feminine interviews. For that 
will undoubtedly be your first 
assignment — ^getting a line on 
the women." 

Further discussion was interrupted by the appearance of J. 
Danforth Simpson himself. The 
instant you set eyes on him you 
knew that here was the Man 
You Had Been Waiting to See. 



The One in Control. The Peison 
with Authority to Act. You could . 
tell by the purposeful way he 
walked. In the firmly compressed 
set of his mouth. By the searching look in his pale blue eyes. 
Above all it was evidenced by 
the handkerchief in his breast 
coat pocket. Obviously it was 
the major executive type of handkerchief. Those three linen points 
standing crisply at attention 
could never have belonged to 
anyone less than the second vicepresident at the very least. They 
were Simpson's badge and seal, 
his official sign of rank. They 
carried all the authority of -he 
gold stars on a general's shoulder. 

"And how is the invasion 
coming?" Simpson asked, giving 
Rawlins a cordial nod and beaming upon his secretary. "Everything on schedule, I trust?" 

"We're ready for the broadcast 
anytime," Linda said. 

"Good. Then shall we proceed 

at once?" 

"Maybe you'd better look over 

this script "first. I had to make 
a few changes since we discussed 
it last time." 

Simpson ran his eye down the 
typewritten pages, taking in 
sentences in great gulps, like an 
editor. 

"Hmm. Why don't we omit 
most of this introduction? The 
basic situation should be suf

ficiently clear without any preliminary buildup." He handed 
the pages back with a quick 
smile. "Condense. Digest. Simplify. Let those be our watchwords. And now if you will 
summon the radio crew please." 

Rawlins could not but admire 
the smooth efficiency with which 
Simpson's staff began preparations for the broadcast. Despite 
their attitude, of outward calm 
he knew the situation was a tense 
one for all concerned. There was 
Stracker, the space surgeon, cool 
and detached, with that perpetual 
expression of polite inquiry in 
his eyes that marks the professional medical man; Doyle 
Wentworth, the organic chemist, 
obviously controlling his nervousness by an effort; Hansen, the 
geophysicist, and a dozen others. 
Men who could easily have made 
a name for themselves in their 
particular fields if they had- not 
preferred anonymity with Simpson. 

The chief stood alone by the 
window gazing out upon the 
turbulent cloud expanse that was 
Venus. What thoughts were 
coursing through the brain cavity 
under that pink expanse of skull? 
Rawlins wondered. Never before 
had any one man achieved such 
complete mastery over so many 
individuals as J. Danforth Simpson. In all Earth there was no 
apparent threat to his domina


tion. One of the principal reasons Rawlins had accepted the 
unexpected invitation to join the 
expedition was that it gave him 
an opportunity to study the man 
at close range. Previously he had 
been nothing more than a vast 
shadowy personality behind a 
powerful chain of newspapers 
and magazines; a name in small 
letters flashed on the screen at 
the end of a television or motion 
picture show; a mind functioning at the center of an intricate 
network of controls extending 
to the farthest reaches of the 
globe. 

It had come as a considerable 
shock, therefore, to discover that 
while Simpson certainly possessed some unusual qualities he was 
by no means the master mind that 
he appeared from a distance. In 
fact, Rawlins had not been associated with his new chief many 
days before he began to suspicion 
that in certain respects the man 
was plain dumb, or at least 
greatly over-estimated. But 
whereas most men spend their 
lives struggling ineffectively 
without getting anywhere Simson by some strange alchemy kept 
on succeeding and succeeding. 
Only you felt that it was always 
just , an accident. With the same 
opportunities you could have 
done the same yourself . ' 

Linda was speaking into the 
transmitter in low, honeyed tones, 



quite different from her usual 
crisp style. r 

"This is Linda King speaking 
to you from the transmitting 
room of the Albireo. At this moment we are revolving over 
Venus about a thousand miles 
above that planet's cloud-covered 
surface. As you all know, this 
is the crucial point in our long 
journey across space. Promptly 
at the close of this broadcast the 
invasion of Venus will begin. 
What the outcome of that venture will be no one knows, least 
of all ourselves. When you hear 
from us again — if you do hear 
from us again — we will be broadcasting from the surface of the 
planet itself. 

"We know how impatiently 
you must be waiting news of an 
invasion that we hope will open 
up a new world of untold wealth 
for colonization and development. Probably you are wondering how it feels to be standing 
poised upon the brink of onslaught at such a moment in 
history. And so I am going to 
ask the man to tell you who conceived and put into execution 
this great project — J. Danforth 
Simpson." 

Simpson stepped solemnly to 
the transmitter. 

"Dear friends," he began, 
speaking in a voice tense with 
emotion, "all I can say at this 
time is that I feel very humble. 



iON 5 

Upon our shoulders rests the 
responsibility of bringing the 
fruits of our civilization and culture to a primitive people. But 
let me emphasize that we come 
to these people — not as arrogant 
conquerors — but as friends with 
hearts overflowing with goodwill 
and tenderness. We come not as 
self-seeking spoilers but as kindly 
neighbors eager to share the 
flower of our fruits and arts, so 
that what has taken us centuries 
of toil to achieve may be made 
available to others in an instant 
of time." 

"Mr. Simpson, will you tell 
us how you plan to proceed about 
this invasion?" 

"I shall proceed as if it were 
impossible to fail," Simpson replied promptly. "Indeed from 
the very start there has never 
been a moment when I had the 
slightest misgiving. In my own 
mind it is already done." 

"What will be your first act 
upon landing?" 

"Well, I think my first act 
will be to establish cordial relations with the Venusian people. 
As you know, Venus is a world 
closely similar to our own. From 
what information we have been 
able to secure from preliminary 
scouting expeditions there is 
every reason for believing that 
Venus and its inhabitants are 
essentially identical with our own 
world, except that there appears 



6 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



to be a gap of a few thousand 
years in time. But this is a gulf 
easily spanned. In a year I predict that they will be as one 

With US." 

"Does Venus at present 
possess any form of government 
that might oppose our mission?" 

"Well, none worth mentioning. Oh, there is a ruler of" sorts 
who appears to exercise mild 
authority over the planet's few 
million inhabitants. Curiously 
enough this ruler is a woman. 
An interesting coincidence when 
we recall that Venus is named 
after the goddess of love." 

"I'm sure the feminine members of our audience will be 
anxious to hear more of this 
woman ruler," Linda murmured, 
a hint of laughter behind her 
voice. "How she looks and what 
she wears. And how- she takes 
the invasion of her domain." 

"We don't anticipate any difficulty on that score," Simpson 
said. "Considering the fact that 
she has nothing whatever with 
which to oppose us." 

"Then this woman is quite 
powerless, you think?" 

"Oh, quite. But naturally, the 
thought of force is highly reprehensible to us. As I stand here, 
with , the invasion now only 
minutes away, I feel that our 
strongest weapon is the nobility 
of our purpose. The fact that 
we come actuated only by the 



highest ideals. The loftiest 
motives. Truly we can say with 
the poet, 'Our strength is as the 
strength of ten because our heart 
is pure.' " 

"I'm sure that expresses the 
feelings of us all, Mr. Simpson," 
Linda assured him warmly. "It 
will be a thought for us to 
cherish during the dark hours 
ahead." 

She nodded to the engineer. 

"And now, friends, the time 
has come when we must abandon 
the comparative comfort of out 
deep-space machine for the 
cramped confines of the highthrust ferry rockets that will convey us to the surface of Venus. 

"And so, good-bye, till you 
hear from us again. The invasion 
is on!" 

n 

RAWLINS struggled up 
through the blanket of unconsciousness that covered him 
fathoms deep. A moment more 
and he would reach the surface. 
There! He sat up and opened his 
eyes. He felt rotten. He decided 
that landing on a planet in one 
of these invasion tubs was like 
falling off a stepladder when you 
had a bad hangover. 

Several times he tried to rise 
but each time he found his leg 
apparently caught under some 
heavy cylindrical object. A piece 



SIMPSON 



7 



of gaspipe sticking through the 
floor, probably. He gave his leg 
a vigorous jerk. The object was 
evidently more complicated than 
he had at first supposed, with 
several knobs and branches projecting from it. 

"If you'll stop kicking me for 
a minute I'll try to move over 
so you can get your foot loose." 

It was Linda's voice coming, as 
it seemed, from a great distance. 
He remained obediently quiet 
while she went through some sort 
of contortional act. The next 
thing he knew she was sitting 
up beside him rubbing her nose. 

"You had your foot right in 
my face," she said reproachfully. 

"Sorry," Rawlins apologized. 
"You'll have to chalk it up to 
inexperience. My first invasion, 
you know." 

Linda continued to investigate 
her various features. Presently 
she shook her head as if to clear 
away the cobwebs, and glanced 
around the narrow interior of the 
cabin. 

"I wonder where Dr. Stracker 
is?" 

"I think I can hear him 
stirring up front now." 

"Let's go see," she said, getting to her knees. 

They worked their way along 
the side of the ship to the section 
where the controls were housed. 
Dr. Stracker was lying on his 
stomach peering through the for


ward window. Rawlins crawled 
up beside him. 

"How's the scenery outside?" 
he asked. 

"Take a look," Stracker said, 
rolling away from the window. 

Rawlins flattened his nose 
against the glass. By looking up 
at a sharp angle through the 
narrow aperture he was able to 
discern a dozen men and women 
gazing down at them from the 
rim of the crater formed by the 
impact of the rocket. 

"Curious looking creatures, 
aren't they?" Stracker said. 
"Judging from their garb, they re 
still in the early pastoral stage." 

"Judging from their whiskers 
they certainly haven't reached the 
safety razor stage," Rawlins said. 

"The women look as if they 
had just stepped out of an 
operetta," Linda exclaimed, 
"with those flowing white costumes and the flowers in their 
hair. You know — the merry villagers who come dancing in at 
the end of the act." 

For several minutes they lay 
staring up at the Venusians who 
stared back with equal solemnity. 

"Now I think I. know how 
those Martians felt in the War 
of the Worlds," Rawlins grunted. 
"I'll bet they were just as upset 
as the people outside gawking at 
them." 

"I wonder if we shouldn't be 
thinking about getting out of 



8 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



here," Stracker remarked, working one leg cautiously back and 
forth. 

"The plan was to leave the 
rockets and contact Simpson as 
soon as possible," Linda said. 
"Then when we. were all assembled and if there were no 
mishaps we were to march on the 
palace immediately." 

"The palace?" Rawlins echoed. 
"You mean' they've got a palace 
around here someplace?" 

"Well, the place where the 
queen lives anyhow." 

"Then suppose we start making preparations for leaving," 
Stracker said. "I'll see if I can 
find the rifles and ammunition." 

"Wonder if we'll need 'em?" 
Rawlins said, peering out at the 
Venusians again. "They don't 
look very belligerent to me." 

"Simpson said expressly to 
come out fully armed," Linda 
stated firmly. "I don't think we 
have any business deviating from 
his instructions." 

They emerged from the ship 
a few minutes later and clambered up the side of the crater taking 
care to keep their rifles trained 
on the crowd at all times. The 
Venusians backed away from 
them without displaying any particular signs either of animosity 
or alarm. Rawlins found their 
silent appraising scrutiny harder 
to bear than if they had been 
openly hostile. They made him 



feel as nervous as a new boy at 
school who knows that some of 
the kids are laying for him afterward. 

The three gained the top of 
the bank where they stood 
huddled together taking stock of 
their surroundings. The air was 
hot and dry with the burning 
penetrating heat of the desert. A 
low stunted type of vegetation 
resembling ice_ plant reddish 
green in color with coarse fleshy 
creepers sprawled over the desert 
like a ragged carpet. Behind the 
thick cirrus haze that mantled the 
sky, the sun was a blurred yellow smear. The wind drifting 
over the sand dunes carried a 
faint acrid odor like that of 
scorching metal. Far away against 
the horizon three enormous crater 
cones smoldered black and forbidding. 

Rawlins gave the doctor a 
nudge. "Why don't you ask them 
something? My Venusians not 
so good.'" 

"Mine neither," Stracker replied. He turned to Linda. "I 
believe you're the best qualified 
to hold speech with these people. 
Maybe we ought to introduce 
ourselves." 

Linda hesitated. Apparently 
even she was flustered a bit by the 
Venusians' silent stare. Presently 
she addressed the man nearest 
her, a tall gaunt individual with 
long white waterfall whiskers.

"We have come a great distance from another world," she 
said, waving her hand overhead. 
"We come to you as friends. We 
do not wish to harm you. We 
hope our rockets did not injure 
you when they fell from the 
sky."* 

The man did not reply but 
examined Linda with his solemn 
owlish eyes, his gaze shifting 
back and forth between her face 
and wrinkled coverall suit. Then, 
before anyone could intervene, 
he stepped forward and ran his, 
fingers over her face and through 
her hair as if he were sampling 
some piece of merchandise. 

"Well, of all the nerve!" 
Linda gasped. 

"Say, what's the idea?" 
Rawlins demanded, advancing a 
step. 

"Watch it," Stracker cautioned, holding him back. 

The Venusian pointed an accusing finger at Linda. 

"We guessed you came from 
another world," he said. "We 
thought you would only be men. 
We did not expect to find a 
woman among you." 

"Why did you not expect to 
find a woman among us?" Linda 
asked.
"Our women do not accompany men on long journeys. 
Women should remain at home 
to gather fruit and berries and 
to care for the children." 



"You mean the women have 
to do all the work around here?" 

The Venusian shrugged indifferently. "There are always 
plenty of women to do the 
work." 

Rawlins noticed that several 
of the Venusian men grinned 
and nudged one another as if 
they found the old man's remarks amusing. Although powerfully built, rough-looking fellows, they seemed good-natured 
enough. 

"Remember these people are 
several thousand years behind us," Rawlins told Linda. 
"They never heard of woman's 
rights." 

"Then why have they got a 
queen for a ruler?" 

"It's not so unusual. Several 
women in times past have ruled 
great countries and done a fairly 
good job of it, too. There was 
Queen Elizabeth, for instance, 
and Catherine the Great and 
Maria Theresa of Austria. Although they ruled as absolute 
monarchs, the position of women 
did not improve during their 
reigns. The men still managed 
to keep their wives pretty well 
under their thumbs." 

"Yes, I'd go slow here," 
Stracker suggested. "Some tradi

io cosmos se 

tion is doubtless involved that 
we don't understand as yet." 

"Well, if you ask me, I think 
they're in a rut," said Linda. 

It gave Rawlins a certain 
perverse pleasure to see her discomfiture. 

"Take it easy, honey," he 
grinned. "I tiiink the old boy's 
got something maybe." 

Before Linda could retort they 
were interrupted by the sound of 
voices growing louder behind 
some sand dunes. In a few 
minutes Simpson came into view 
over the hillcock followed by his 
staff and a crowd of perhaps a 
hundred Venusians. A score of 
children in various degrees of 
nudity ran laughing and shouting 
before them. 

Simpson hailed them with a 
wave of his arm. 

"Things couldn't be better," 
he puffed. "Think of it— not a 
single person killed or even 
seriously injured. Shows you 
what careful planning will 
do." 

He stood with his hands on 
his hips gazing around him triumphantly. His face was flushed 
from the exertion and the vein 
in his right temple throbbed 
visibly. 

"What a country," he cried. 
"Never dreamed it would be this 
good. There's a beautiful green 
valley right below us. A regular 
treasure house of nature. And

to think we've got the first crack 
at it." 

"How about the natives?" 
Rawlins remarked. "Maybe they 
won't see it that way." 

"Don't think so," Simpson replied, gaining confidence as he 
got his wind back. "They strike 
me as extraordinarily cooperative, 
from what I've seen of them. 
We can get an index on their 
opinions and attitudes later. 
Leave all that paper work up to 
you. Right now I want to set up 
headquarters and consolidate our 
position. Do first things first. 
That's my motto." 

He motioned to an officer in 
the intelligence corps. 

"What's our position, Baker?" 

"Not more than two hours 
hike to the capital city, I should 
say. The navigator did a swell 
job of bringing us in." 

"This the city where the queen 
lives?" 

"That's right?" 

"What have we got on her, 
anyway?" 

The officer consulted his notes. 
"Well, not much, to tell the 
truth. Name's Hortense near as 
we can pronounce it. Seems to 
have been running things here 
as far back as anybody can remember. Pretty well liked apparently. That about sums it up." 

"Hmm," Simpson grunted. 
"Old dame, probably. Senile 
monarch surrounded by few

faithful servitors. Putters around 
the palace while the royal chamberlain pulls the strings. Might 
get opposition there. Got to be 
on guard. Watch everything. 
That's our motto." 

He seized a whistle dangling 
from a cord around his neck and 
blew a blast that made the 
Venusians jump. 

"We're marching on the 
palace," he announced. "Going 
to see Queen Hortense, the ruler 
of this planet, and inform her 
of the plans we intend to put 
iato effect for the benefit of her 
loyal subjects." 

He smiled benevolently on the 
Venusians clustered around him. 

"Perhaps some of our friends 
here might be able to show us 
the way. Hey, Mac, how about 
you?" he called, pointing to a 
Venusian lad whose face showed 
a glimmering of intelligence 
above the rest. "Want to make a 
fast buck?" 

The boy grinned .and bobbed 
his head. 

"Good. Then lead on, MacDuff. You take care of us and 
we'll take care of you." 

They made a strange procession trouping over the desert, the 
Earthmen in their somber garments with their snub-nosed 
rifles crooked under their arms, 
followed by the flower-decked 
Venusians, like actors in a 
modern drama who had strayed 



onto a set depicting a grove in 
Arcady. 

After tramping over the desert 
for half an hour their guide led 
them to a highway bordered by 
flowering plants intermingled 
with a thick growth of dark 
decumbent vine. Occasionally the 
jungle was broken by a mud hut 
with a garden in front and some 
smaller buildings in the rear. 
These houses rose from the 
ground in smooth flowing lines 
as naturally as the shrubs around 
them.* Although crude structures, they were not without a 
certain charm. Each dwelling was 
in some way distinguished from 
its neighbors, by the curving line 
of the doorway, the configuration of the windows, or the manner in which a vine had been 
trained to conceal some detail of 
construction. 

News of the invasion had 
evidently gone before them, for 
the travellers often found whole 
families lined up along the road 
awaiting their -arrival. As already 
mentioned, the men, with their 
fierce whiskers and brawny arms 
and shoulders, had a fearsome 
appearance although their eyes 
seemed kind and friendly. The 
women, on the whole, were 
rather disappointing. Some of the

velocities exceeding a hundred miles an 
hour.

younger ones were quite attractive but few would have qualified 
as first-rate glamor girls. The 
main trouble seemed to be that 
they made so little use of what 
natural charms they had. Aside 
from the flowers they made no 
attempt at adornment whatever. 
Their white gowns hung around 
their bodies as awkwardly as 
maternity dresses. Their hair 
hung in lank strands about their 
face or was done up in a coarse 
knot behind. No powder dimmed 
■the sheen of their noses or cheeks. 
Like the women in tropical 
countries of the Earth they gave 
signs of aging early. At thirty 
they might have been fifty; at 
fifty they were wrinkled crones, 
their faces stiffened into a gray 
mask by the pitiless Venusian 
sun. 

"Well, at least nobody's 
thrown any tomatoes or dead cats 
at us yet," Rawlins observed, as 
they entered the outskirts of the 
city. 

"Haven't noticed them strewing any roses in our path either," 
Stacker replied. "These people 
give me a peculiar feeling. As if 
I were a patient in a clinic stripped down for examination." 

Rawlins chuckled. "I know 
what you mean. But I guess we'd 
take a good hard look at any 
•invaders who landed on the 
Earth, too." 
Just when the crowd was 



getting so thick they had trouble 
forcing their way down the 
street, their guide 4 led them into 
a broad square facing a stone 
building that was evidently the 
palace. There was an altar on 
each side of the entrance, one 
burning with a low flame, the 
other piled high with combustibles as if for kindling. The 
crowd had overflowed into the 
square and spread out along the 
far end opposite the palace. 

The palace was by far the 
largest building the travellers 
had seen on Venus although 
judged by terrestrial standards it 
would hardly have made a fairsized county court house. Like 
all Venusian buildings it was 
constructed along streamlines 
that gave it a strangely modernappearance. The stones were old 
and worn and in protected places 
splotched by some greenish fungus growth. Long narrow windows stared out from the walls 
like cat's eyes. A narrow balcony 
ran along the upper story overlooking the square. 

Their Venusian guide waved 
his hand toward the palace and 
did a quick fadeout into the 
crowd, leaving the Earthmen 
stranded in the middle of the 
square. 

"Can't say I like the looks of 
this, " the intelligence officer muttered. "These people are too expectant. As if this was a Roman

holiday and we were the chief 
attraction on the program." 

"Now I think you're misjudging these folks," Simpson said. 
"They seem pretty nice to me. 
Anyhow, we can't stand out here 
forever chewing it over. We've 
got to keep moving. Keep advancing. All the time." 

Simpson suited the action to 
the word by advancing confidently toward the open door of the 
palace. He had taken barely a 
dozen steps when a group of 
men erupted through the door 
and hurled themselves upon the 
invaders. Simpson went down 
like a shot. A wild melee ensued 
as his men sprang to his side. 
The square rang with the crackle 
and whine of bullets and the 
grunt and surge of bodies. 

A man bore down on Rawlins, 
big, bony, and powerful. He 
swung his fist at Rawlins head 
in a wide sweeping arc. Rawiins 
watched the blow coming. He 
knew it would hurt him unless 
he got out of the way but for 
some reason he seemed powerless 
to move. The blow landed with 
a force that jarred him to his 
heels. Rawlins raised his rifle to 
fire then hesitated. The man was 
unarmed. His only weapons -were 
his bare hands. 

The man came lunging at him 
again. Rawlins swung his rifle 
blindly, felt it land with a satisfying crunch. The man grabbed at 



Rawlins' legs as he went down. 
He clawed at him despentely 
trying to rise. Rawlins struck him 
again with his rifle. The man 
slumped to the ground and lay 
still. 

The struggle ended as quickly 
as it had begun. Suddenly the 
Earthmen found themselves 
standing in the center of the 
square, bloody and dishevelled, 
victorious if not exactly triumphant. Their attackers lay dead 
around them or sat on their 
haunches with their heads buried 
in their arms. One man with 
blood trickling .from his mouth ^ 
was being very sick at his 
stomach. 

Rawlins picked his way over 
to the palace door where Linda 
was standing, looking pale 
and shaken but otherwise uninjured, y 

"Sure a nice welcome they 
gave us," he said, managing a 
feeble grin. "I was afraid we 
were done for there for a 
minute." 

"So did I," she whispered, 
trying to smile back. Suddenly 
she was all solicitude. "Oh, 
you've got a bad cut. Hold still 
while I see if I can stop it 
bleeding." 

He held still while Linda applied her handkerchief to the 
wound. 

"There. That will have to do 
till Dr. Stracker can see you."

who went around getting mixed 
up in brawls in front of other 
people's palaces. 



"Maybe they're specially 
selected that way for the palace 
guard," Rawlins suggested. 
"Like the Potsdam giants that 
Frederick the First used to have." 



For one pulsating moment he 
felt those dark eyes appraising 
him. Then, with the barest hint 
of a smile on her lips, the woman 
disappeared behind the balustrade. 



"I wonder. " 



"What do you mean?" he 
asked. 



Something in Linda's tone 
struck him as peculiar.

He followed her gaze. A 
woman was bending over the 
balcony contemplating them with 
her chin cupped in the palms of 
her hands. The sight of her took 
Rawlins breath away. She was 



"Look up there. 




"Guess that must have been the 



queen." 

"Yes, Pretty, isn't she?" 
"Not bad." 



SIMPSON

There was a brief silence. 

"Maybe we should go over 
and see how Simpson is getting 
along," Linda said. 

They found the chief propped 
up against one of the altars looking slightly dazed. 

"Thank goodness you're safe, 
Linda," he sighed. "I'd be lost 
without you." 

He got unsteadily to his feet 
and walked over to where the 
prisoners sat huddled together. 

"What was the big idea? Assaulting us that way?" 

Nobody answered. The men 
sat staring sullenly ahead of 
them with their eyes fixed on the 
ground. 

"You in the blue shirt," Simpson growled, nodding to one of 
the men who from the distinctive character of his dress appeared to be the leader. "You the 
head of this outfit?" 

"What's left of it," the man 
replied. He might have been 
rather handsome if his face had 
not been so lined and tired. 

"That woman up there on the 
balcony a minute ago now. Was 
that Queen Hortense?" 

The man nodded without raising his eyes. 

"She the one sicked you on to 
us?" 

"No, she didn't have anything 
to do with it," the man said, 
showing some animation for the 
first time. "When we heard you 



were out here we lost our heads 
completely. Our only idea was 
to stop you. I guess it wasn't 
such a good idea." 

Simpson stood for a moment 
scowling down at him. 

"These guys look all bushed 
to me," he said to his intelligence 
officer. "I'm for going inside and 
seeing {his Hortense." 

"I think some of us should 
search the place first," the officer 
objected. "There might be some 
more of them hiding in there." 

"We're all here," the leader 
muttered. 

"You know where to find 
Queen Hortense?" Simpson asked him. 

"Sure. You go through that 
door there, walk up the incline, 
and you'll find her out on the 
balcony. She isn't hard to find." 

"Then suppose you get your 
bunch together and find her 
then." 

The prisoners got reluctantly 
to their feet and shufHed toward 
the open palace door followed 
at a discreet distance by the Earthmen. The shadowy recesses of 
the palace were a welcome relief 
from the burning heat of the 
square. Instinctively the men 
dropped their voices and tread 
more gently as if they had entered a cathedral. But it was a 
cathedral in which pagan designs and erotic figures were displayed in place of the usual 



16 COSMOS SC 

religious symbols. The feminine 
influence was everywhere. One 
saw it in the dull gleam of the 
mirrors along the wall; in the 
soft shoulders of the tall vases 
overflowing with pink and 
purple blossoms; in the graceful 
folds of the draperies; and in 
the elaborate use of crystal for 
ornamentation. Over all there 
hung a sense of hushed repose 
that comes only from years of 
ordered living. 

On the second level the man 
led them through an archway 
into a room with smooth sloping 
walls. The woman they had 
seen from the square lay half 
reclining on a low couch near 
the open balcony. She wore a 
simple costume similar to that 
of the other Venusian women, 
except that it was somewhat finer 
and whiter in texture. Several 
girls were gathered about the 
queen studying their visitors 
lazily like dozing cats. One stood 
behind the queen brushing her 
hair with long regular strokes, 
pausing occasionally to smooth 
out a lock with her fingers or to 
run her hand caressingly around 
the back of her neck. 

The queen lay back regarding 
them languidly with the same air 
of detachment that she had viewed them from the balcony. Yet 
it was not upon the invaders but 
upon their prisoners that her * 
glance rested. 



ENCE FICTION 

"So this is the end," she murmured to the leader, a hint of 
reproach in her voice. 

The man gestured helplessly, 
keeping his eyes averted. 

"As I predicted," she said. 

"As you predicted." 

"You worked so long and 
struggled so hard. I really am 
almost sorry that it should have 
ended this way." 

The queen gazed upon him 
with eyes that were very tender. 

"And now you must go . . . 
as you promised me." 

The man motioned to his companions who formed a half -circle 
behind him facing the queen. 
They stood for a moment in 
silence as if too overcome to 
speak. Then they turned and 
started to file slowly from the 
room. Some of Simpson's men 
attempted to bar the way but 
the queen waved them aside. 

"Now what do you think of 
that?" Linda said, as the men's 
footsteps died away down the 
hall. 

"Sounds like something out of 
the last act of the Prisoner of 
Zenda," Rawlins told her. 

Simpson broke the spell with 
a theatrical cough. 

"Can't tell you how much we 
regret this incident in the 
square," he rumbled. "We come 
here on a peaceful mission. Ambassadors of good will, so to 
speak." 



_ "So I see," the queen said, 
glancing at the rifle resting in 
the crook of his arm. 

"Well, naturally we didn't 
know what we might be up 
against here. We had to be ready 
for anything. Hope for the best 
and prepare for the worst. That's 
my motto." 

The queen's eyes were almost 
severe. Then suddenly she relaxed and waved her hand at the 
cushions scattered over the floor. 

"I think I understand perfectly. And now sit down. We can 
talk so much better when we're 
all comfortable." 

She lay back contentedly as 
the men disposed themselves 
around the room arching her 
neck and quivering slightly under 
the regular stroke of the brush. 
Rawlins was sure that if he had 
been a trifle closer he could have 
heard her purr. 

Simpson dragged a pillow 
alongside the couch and sat down 
uncertainly. 

"Now I wouldn't blame you a 
bit for being good and sore at 
having a bunch of strangers come 
barging in on you like this, ' he 
began. "But when you hear the 
proposition I've got to offer I 
think you'll change your mind. 
You got a mighty fine place here, 
your majesty." 

He broke off suddenly. "Say, 
what should I call you anyhow?"' 
The queen favored him with 



what must have been one of her 
sweetest smiles. "Suppose you 
just call me Hortense." 

"Thanks . . . er, Hortense. 
Since we've got business to talk 
over we might as well get acquainted right away. My name's 
Simpson— J. Danforth Simpson. 
7- LV They sometimes call me, 
for short. This is my secretary, 
Linda King. And this young fellow here who keeps so close to 
her all the time is my personal 
advisor and public opinion expert, Steve Rawlins.", 

Linda and Rawlins said something about how happy they were 
to be there which the queen 
acknowledged with a graceful inclination of her head. Simpson 
hitched his pillow closer to the 
couch. 

"As I was saying, you got a 
mighty fine place here, Hortense. 
Unlimited resources from all reports. Plenty of room for expansion. And a mighty fine bunch 
of people from what I've seen 
of 'em. But frankly, the place 
looks kind of run-down to me. 
Kind of sloppy and gone to seed. 
What I'd like to do is work your 
mineral deposits and cultivate the 
land to take care of the increase 
in population that's bound to 
come. With the right organization there isn't any limit to how 
far you could go here." 

Queen Hortense selected a 
fruit resembling a pomegranate 



13 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



from a basket by her side and 
began nibbling at it daintly, exploring the soft pulpy interior 
with the tip of her tongue. 

"Now if you don't mind my 
saying so I doubt if you've got 
the know-how here on Venus to 
swing a deal of this size," Simpson continued, warming to his 
subject. "Understand, I don't 
doubt for a minute you're every 
bit as smart as us. Maybe even 
smarter. But you see we got 
quite a head start on you. It 
takes time to build up to the 
level we've reached. It takes lots 
and lots of time. So what I say 
is — why wait? When we're 
right here to hand you these 
things on a silver platter." 

"Just what is it you wish to 
bring us?" 

"Well, there's lots of things. 
Things I can't describe because 
you've never seen or heard of 
anything like 'em before. Things 
like motors and rockets and 
atomic energy. And houses with 
all the modern conveniences instead of these little shacks your 
people live in now. And rafts of 
other things that make life easier 
like the movies and television 
and flush toilets. You just give 
me a year or two and Venus will 
be so spick-and-span and so upand-coming you won't know the 
place." 

Kortense ran her tongue over 
her lips licking up the red juice 



that had oozed from the pomegranate. 

"Suppose I do not wish my 
world made over? Suppose I prefer to keep it just as it is at 
present?" 

Simpson shifted his weight 
from one knee to the other. 

"Well, Hortense, I'm laying 
all my cards on the table. It 
took a lot of work to organize 
this trip. Furthermore, I didn't 
come here entirely for the pleasure of making your acquaintance. 
Now that I'm here it looks even 
better than I expected. In other 
words, I'm here to stay." 

"In other words you will put 
your ideas into execution whether 
it pleases me or not." 

"Let's put it this way. I'm 
what they call a self-made man. 
If I do say it myself I think I've 
made a success out of my life. 
I've never failed in anything I 
set out to do and I don't intend 
to begin now." 

Queen Hortense waved the 
pomegranate at the little group 
of men around her. "But how 
can you dictate to me? When 
there are so few of you and so 
many of us?" 

Simpson's face was grim. "I 
warn you, don't try to resist us. 
I have resources and equipment 
at my disposal you know nothing 
about. Believe me, I am thinking 
of your best interest when I warn 
you— don't try to resist us." 



Hortense sank back limply on 
her couch. 

"It's true," she sighed. "My 
people are kind and peaceful and 
know nothing of the arts of war. 
We could not resist you even if 
we tried." 

She twisted her body into a 
more comfortable position so 
that she lay facing Simpson 
directly. "We are quite helpless. 
You have us completely in your 
power. We are yours. Take us. 
Do with us what you will." 

Simpson made a deprecating 
gesture. 

"Well, now I wouldn't put it 
quite that way, Hortense. People 
don't make wars anymore. They 
went out years ago. Oh, of course, 
there's a little skirmish now and 
then but no real bloodshed, you 
understand. Cooperation's' the 
watchword these days. Now confound it! When I said we came 
here to help you I meant every 
word of it. When you see the 
things I've got planned you'll be 
with me a hundred per cent." 

"You are free to start any time, 
Mr. Simpson." 

"Then I'll start right now! " 
Before he could get to his feet 
Hortense caught him by the arm. 
"I have only one thing more to 
say." 

- t >," A11 ri & ht ' S° anead and say 

Hortense split one of the

teeth. "Your project will end 
in ruin. As surely as it ended 
in ruin for those men who just 
left the room." 

''Why will it end in ruin?" 

"Because it is destined from 
the beginning to fail." 

"Suppose that's a risk I'm will- . 
ing to take?" 

Hortense shrugged and lay 
back with her eyes closed and : 
her hands folded in her lap as 
if she had lost all further interest in the conversation. Simpson struggled to his feet and 
stood gazing down at his hostess 
with a wooden expression. At 
length he wrenched his eyes away 
and gestured to Linda and 
Rawlins. 

"Come on, let's get out of 
here. We've got work ahead of 
us." 

rv 

IN THE early days of his career 
Rawlins had helped pay expenses by assisting a photographer who specialized in art for 
the fashion magazines. He soon 
learned that one of the first rules 
of the business was that everything must be done in a hurry. 
Thus if the editors of Fascination decided that their June issue 
needed some photographs of a 
model in a seersucker bathing 
suit reclining on the beach in 
front of the Rock of Gibraltar, 



20 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



they would generally be notified 
along about the middle of March. 
By flying to the Mediterranean, 
working feverishly for a week, 
and airmailing the negatives 
back to the photographic laboratory, the color prints would be 
on the editors' desk the day before the deadline. After diis they 
would be notified that owing to 
a switch in plans the prints would 
not go into the magazine until 
the August issue. Hence, working under pressure was no new 
experience in Rawlins' life; in 
fact, long ago he had come to 
regard it as a natural part of his 
existence. 

What Rawlins now discovered 
was that he knew nothing whatever about working under pressure. Trying to keep pace with 
Simpson made his best previous 
efforts seem as leisurely as reporting for a college annual. Fundamentally, however, it was really 
quite simple. You worked as 
hard as you could every second 
and then you quit for awhile. 
When you woke up you started 
in all over again. The chief difficulty was trying to relax and 
go to sleep. There was no escaping the burning heat. The brassy 
glare of the sun behind the 
cirrus haze was always beating 
down. The pressure never abated. 

"How do you manage to stand 
up under the strain?" Rawlins 
asked one day, watching Linda's 



fingers^ flying over the keys of 
her typewriter. 

They had set up temporary 
offices on the second level of the 
palace, considerably removed 
from those occupied by Queen 
Hortense and her retinue of 
maidens. Their typewriters and 
mechanical computers contrasted 
strangely" with the rococo ornamentation of the suite, as out of 
place as a tractor in a Watteau 
painting. 

"You learn to manage afterwhile," Linda replied, giving 
him an arch smile. "You decide 
what you've got to do and then 
you try to do it. See?" 

"You mean you really do? ' 

"Of course. Why not?" 

"I've read articles about people who claimed they regulated 
their lives that way but I never 
supposed they actually existed. I 
always thought they were characters those fellows dreamed up 
who write these HOW TO 
books." 

He regarded her with frank 
curiosity. "Tell me, how did a, 
girl like you ever get tied up 
with a bunch like this in the first 
place?" 

Linda's eyes were amused and 
irritated by turns. "Does that interest you?" 

"Yes, it does. Oh, of course, 
if you'd rather not . . ." 

"No, I don't mind." Her fingers strayed idly over the keys. 



SIMPSON 



"It all happened by accident 
nearly seven years ago. That was 
just before Simpson began his 
rise to power. I was sitting at a 
lunch counter drinking a cup of 
coffee and feeling thoroughly 
miserable. Besides having a cold, 
I had just lost my job through 
no fault of mine, and jobs were 
hard to get then. 

"While I was sitting there I 
noticed this man watching me. 
I tried not to pay attention, 
thinking he would go away in a 
minute. Instead he came directly 
\> where I was sitting and took 
:he seat beside me. 

' 'Young woman,' he said, 
do you know that the bloodvessels that supply your lower 
extremities all run down the 
back of your legs? That when you 
cross your legs as you are now 
you automatically shut off the 
flow to your arteries thus imposing an unnecessary strain on 
your heart?' 

" 'You're the first man who 
ever told me he didn't like to see 
me with my legs crossed,' I 
said. 

"He didn't crack a smile. 

" 'Besides putting an extra 
strain on your heart your present 
posture also increases the amount 
of nervous energy required to 
send the blood through your 
body.' 

"He gave me a look that went 
clear through me. 'You look as 



21 



if you were rather low on nervous energy right now.' 

" 7 am. I just lost my job.' 
" 'How would you like to 
work for me?' 

" 7 don't care. I'd as leave 
work for you as anyone else.' 

"He scribbled his name on the 
back of a card. 'Go to this address and tell them to put you 
to work immediately.' 

"I examined the card, feeling 
more amused than anything else. 
'Wait a minute. How much are 
you paying me first?' 

" 'Twice what you got before,' he snapped. "Now get 
along — and don't cross your 
legs any more.' " 

She laughed. "Well, that's the 
way, it began. Working for 
Simpson was like nothing I had 
ever done before. He seemed to 
take possession of you and carry 
you along with him. Half a 
dozen times I tried to break 
away, but it was so much easier 
to keep on going. There's a fascination about Simpson that gets 
hold of you and won't let you 
stop, even though you hate him 
sometimes." 

"You mean you hate him? 
You hate Simpson?" 

"Oh, goodness, yes. Lots of 
times. It's the way you have to 
work sometimes on a project you 
know is silly and ridiculous underneath. But once Simpson 
launches a campaign there's no

COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



turning back. When you get an 
organization started involving 
thousands of people and millions 
of dollars everything connected 
with it becomes important merely because it's so big. Because it's 
Simpson. 

"I remember, one time, we 
were trying to launch a new 
comic character on television 
called Old Dad Dill Pickle. We 
spent months working on that 
character. Strong men sweat 
and suffered, laughed and cried, 
and gave the best they had of 
their head and hand. It was play, 
but desperately grim sort of 
play. And all so that Old Dad 
Dill Pickle could amuse the 
children every afternoon in the 
hope of getting the little monsters to buy more prefabricated 
popcorn or whatever it was." 

Rawlins came over and clasped her hand fondly in his. "You 
know something?" 

"No. What?" 

"I think maybe I can love you 
now. I couldn't before, but now 
it's all right. You've relieved my 
mind tremendously." 

"Is that the only effect my 
life story has had upon you?" 

"No, there are some other 
things, but that's the most important. Someday I'll tell you all 
about it." He strolled over to 
one of the long oval windows 
facing the sun. 

Linda glanced at the stack of 



papers on his desk. "How's the 
report coming?" 

"Not so good. Interviewing 
these people is nothing but 
grief. Not that I ever supposed 
it would be easy." 

"What's the matter? The 
women again?" 

"Not entirely. For some 
reason it seems hard to reach the 
Venusian mind. I have the feeling ail the time there's some barrier between us. Another trouble 
is they're all a-twitter over 
something. Can't get them to 
settle down and answer questions." 

"Now that is something I can 
explain," Linda said. "They're 
getting ready for the Festival of 
Fire. We're all invited by special 
invitation of Queen Hortense. 
Simpson wants us to be on nand 
wearing our very best behavior." 

Rawlins regarded her incredulously. "But I thought he was 
sore at her. After the way she 
predicted he'd fail and everything." 

Linda laughed with genuine 
amusement. 

"Of course not. Oh, I think 
he was really peeved there for a 
minute. But now he'll make 
every effort to win her over. You 
don't get ahead by increasing the 
number of your enemies," 

"No, I suppose not," Rawlins 
agreed absently. "What's this 
Festival of Fire thing anyhow?" 



"Some sort of ritual they celebrate every so often at sunset. 
Haven't you noticed how they 
always keep a fire burning in one 
of the altars beside the palace? 
It's a symbol of their way of life. 
I don't understand it myself entirely." 

Rawlins turned back to the 
window. He thought the sun had 
been stuck in the sky over by 
those three volcanoes with the 
smoke perpetually hanging above 
them. Now, for the first time, it 
occurred to him that the sun 
might actually set some time. 

"So that's what everybody is 
so wrought up about. All right. 
Tell Simpson he can count on 
me for the fireworks." 

The members of Simpson's 
staff were assembled on the balcony of the palace chatting in 
low tones or peering over the 
edge at the throng below. Although outwardly calm there 
was a certain restlessness in the 
queen's guests. An attitude of 
covert watchfulness mingled 
with strained expectancy. A 
trained observer would have said 
that their behavior corresponded 
to that of well-bred people who 
are dying for a drink but are too 
polite to mention the fact to their 
host. 

"What I wouldn't give for a 
good stiff shot of bourbon," 
Rawlins groaned, trying to un


>50N 23 

glue his shirt from his arms. 
"Just straight bourbon and ice. 
Nothing else." 

"Perhaps the heat will let 
down after sunset," Stracker 
said, gazing at the red disk of 
. the sun that hung like a lumpy 
balloon over the three crater 
cones. 

"Well, if I don't get some 
kind of liquid refreshment 
- pretty quick I'll pass out sure," 
Rawlins said. "Where are Simpson and Queen Hortense? What 
are we waiting for?" 

"I think they're coming 
now," Linda said. 

Queen Hortense swept into 
the room followed by Simpson 
and a troupe of girls evidently 
in ceremonial costume. The 
queen was even lovelier if possible than before. Her eyes were 
bright as stars and there was new 
color in her pale cheeks. 
^ Despite the oppressive heat 
Simpson managed to present his 
customary scrubbed appearance. 
Although the moisture was 
trickling down the side of his 
thick neck and his collar was 
wilted, the three prongs of his 
pocket handkerchief were as 
crisp and alert as ever. 

He advanced to the center of 
the room and held up his hand 
for silence. 

"This evening we are privileged to witness one of the 
most ancient and honored of 



24 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



Venusian customs — the Festival 
of Fire," he said, beaming upon 
them like a fat moon. "The Festival of Fire is celebrated only at 
sunset. Although sunset here occurs about every twenty of our 
days the Festival of Fire occurs 
only when the Venusian moon is 
in conjunction with the sun at 
nightfall, an event that takes 
place at intervals of roughly 
once a year. Then the fire which 
has burned low since the last 
Festival is lighted anew to dispel the darkness gathering over 
the planet. 

"As I understand, this ceremony is associated with Venusian social customs of long standing. If these customs perchance 
appear strange and bizarre to us 
let us remember that many of 
our customs on Earth would certainly prove equally puzzling to 
a Venusian. In fact, there are 
some of ours I was never able to 
understand myself." 

With a bow and a smile he 
backed away leaving Hortense in 
the center of the room. 

"Rather a nice little speech," 
Rawlins said. "Didn't think the 
old boy had it in him." 

"It ought to be good," Linda 
told him. "I wrote it," 

Again the sight of Hortense 
made Rawlins catch his breath. 
Her beauty was almost too perfect. The folds of her gown had 
a way of parting, unexpectedly 



revealing glimpses of a figure 
that could only be described as 
dazzling. Yet there was a sweet 
unconsciousness in her manner 
that was altogether disarming in 
its innocence. 

"The Festival of Fire is our 
oldest custom," she said gravely. 
"Although each word and gesture are rigorously prescribed by 
tradition yet the ceremony actually represents the casting 
aside of tradition, the banishing 
of habits that if continued 
would lead us into fixed patterns 
of thought and action. For we 
never wish to be bound. We 
wish to go on our way serene 
and untrammeled as the sun and 
moon in their courses. And so 
at every Festival we renew ourselves by drawing fresh youth 
and vitality from the fire." 

As she spoke they became 
aware of faint voices raised from 
the square in a kind of chant repeated over and over again, each 
time rising higher and more compelling than before. There was 
an eerie quality to the refrain 
arousing an emotion akin to 
that of the magic fire music 
from Die Walkure. 

"We must go now," Hortense 
cried. "In a moment the sun will 
sink behind the crater cones. You 
will find food and drink for your 
refreshment." 

She hurried from the room 
followed by her maidens. 



"Queen Hortense has kindly 
prepared a buffet supper for us," 
' Simpson said, when they were 
alone. "She suggested that we 
partake while we are waiting for 
the commencement of the ceremony." 

It was the first opportunity the 
men had had to sample Venusian 
fare, so that they inspected the 
food laid out for them with 
curiosity not unmixed with a 
certain degree of trepidation. 
There were fruits similar to the 
apricot, peach, and pear; a form 
of melon about the size of a cucumber which, upon being sliced, 
revealed the glistening pink 
flesh within; and platters stacked 
high with slices of gray and 
white meat exhaling a spicy 
odor. Simpson set an example by 
boldly helping himself to generous portions of each. 

"Where's that drink the 
queen mentioned?" Rawlins 
said, scanning the table eagerly. 

"Here you are," Stracker told 
him, filling a glass from one of 
the pitchers. "Happy days." 

Rawlins sniffed the colorless 
liquid suspiciously. "Must be 
straight gin, I guess." 

"You don't suppose ..." He 
lifted the glass and took a cautious sip. "Good lord, it is! It's 
water. Plain water!" 

Stracker chuckled softly. 
"Apparently they haven't learned 
to distill spirits yet. How woa


5QN 25 

derful! Think of the whole 
world of discovery that lies, all 
unexplored, before them." 

"Well anyhow, it's wet," 
Rawlins said philosophically. 
"Fairly cold, too." He emptied 
the glass without taking it from 
his lips and poured himself another. "Let's take our supper 
out on the balcony, shall we? I 
want to see this renewal business." 

The chant was becoming more 
insistent every moment. Now 
the people in the square were 
standing like statues with one 
arm raised toward the setting 
sun. Hortense and her maidens 
were advancing slowly toward 
the altar piled with combustibles. 

"I see the moon!" Linda cried, 
clapping her hands. 

"Where?" Rawlins demanded. 
"Don't believe they've got a 
moon here." 

"Just above the sun. Like a 
bright star." 

"Hmm. So it is. Too small to 
show a disk, apparently." 

The music Was becoming almost too poignant in its intensity to bear. The dying sun had 
suddenly become a symbol of 
everything Rawlins had longed 
and cherished in his life. And 
now it was going away. Sinking 
into the underworld. A fragment of verse from childhood 
came back to him.

Alas, alas, fair lnes, 

She went away with song, 
With music waiting on her steps, 

And- shouting of the throng . . 

The figures in the square 
stood as if transfixed under the 
amber rays of the sun as Hortense mounted the steps to the 
altar. A man was holding a 
torch over a nest of glowing 
coals, turning it and nursing it 
into life. Only a dull red sliver 
of the sun remained. Would it 
never go? At last — it was gone. 
The star shone out above it clear 
and bright. 

The man knelt and offered the 
torch to Queen Hortense. She 
seized it in both her hands and 
held it aloft for some time as if 
repeating an incantation. Suddenly she turned and flung it 
upon the altar. The fire was a 
feeble thing at first, crawling 
over the pyre in a flickeiing 
blue line, slowly spreading and 
strengthening, then flaring up in 
a rush of yellow flame illuminating the whole square. 

A roar burst from the throng. 
The music dissolved into hoarse 
cries and shrill peals of laughter. 
The people threw up their arms 
and ran about, embracing one another rapturously. 

Rawlins felt immoderately excited. His heart was pounding 
furiously and his scalp was 
prickling as if his hair was 



standing on end. He ran his 
tongue over his lips. Strange 
how dry they were. The inside 
of his mouth was dry, too. He 
turned to Stracker trying to say 
something but the words stuck in 
his throat. 

"Rawlins, what's the matter. 
Are you all right?" 

He saw the doctor and Linda 
regarding him anxiously. He 
grinned and pointed to his mouth 
trying to make them understand. 

"Confounded heat," he croaked. "Think I'll get myself 
'nother drink." 

He started toward the tables 
at the back of the room but his 
legs felt numb as if they were 
asleep. The noise from the 
crowd was almost drowned by 
the ringing in his ears. He 
swayed . . . felt himself falling . .■ . 

"So that's renewing your 
youth," he whispered. 

Stracker was bending over 
him a puzzled expression in his 
eyes. It was the last thing he remembered. 

V 

HESTOR HILDEGARDE was 
being very stern with her 
television audience. 

"Now I'm going to say that 
again so that everyone of you 
will be sure to hear, (Pause). 
There is no such thing as a home


If woman. Get it? There . . . is 
. . no . . . such . . . thing . . . 
. . . as . . . a . . . homely . . . 
woman. There are only women 
who let themselves be homely. 
(Triumphantly) Makes a difference, doesn't it? One year ago — 
yes. Then there might have been 
an excuse. But today there is not 
the single, teeny-weeniest excuse 
why you can't be the wonderful 
YOU that nature intended. 
: "For no matter what your special problem may be — bulging 
waistline— flabby skin— brittle 
hair — remember that to the government charm counselor there 
are no beauty problems. She will 
call to advise you in the privacy 
of your own home. She will select the makeup that is most flattering to you. A makeup that 
will give your skin that dewy 
fresh eye-catching loveliness you 
have always dreamed about. A 
shade of lipstick that vibrates to 
your personality. Exotic perfumes that are like the breath of 
romance. So call your government charm counselor now. Remember—beauty is only as far 
away as the dial on your telephone. 

"And now we come to our 
fashion forecast. Well, girls, 
there are curves ahead ..." 

Rawlins emitted a low moaning sound from the depths of 
the armchair where he was ensconced, gloomily contemplat


ing Hestor Hildegarde's carefully preserved features on the 
television screen. With a great 
effort he propelled himself 
across the room and turned off 
the set. 

"Nobody can ever realize 
how I hate myself sometimes," 
he confided to Linda, busily captioning photographs at her desk 
in the corner. "And to think I 
have to help promote that stuff!" 

"How's the beauty campaign 
coming?" she inquired. 

"The Venusians are barely 
nibbling so far. But Simpson has 
some powerful bait in that highpressure glamor stuff he's handing out. A. woman's lot on this 
planet hasn't been a particularly 
happy one in years past. Only the 
very prettiest married, and the 
others had to take whatever they 
could get. Until Simpson showed 
up they never knew there were 
more than about two ways to 
catch a husband. Now they 
think they've all got a chance." 
"How're the men taking it?" 
"Remarkably well, considering. Frankly, I doubt if they 
realize what's happening to 
them yet. They're such good-natured, easy-going cusses I don't 
believe they'd recognize a social 
revolution if it hit them in the 
face/' 

He bent nearer, lowering his 
voice. "Baker over in the cosmetics lab was telling me a good 



28 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



one that illustrates what I mean. 
It seems that a couple of travelling men from Mars met a girl 
from Venus — " 

"Shush," said Linda. "Here 
comes J.D. now." 

Simpson entered with a handful of manuscripts which he 
placed on Linda's desk. He nodded vacantly to Rawlins, pulled 
up a chair, and adjusted his 
glasses. 

"I'd like to get your opinion 
on some of these manuscripts, 
Linda," he said, tapping the one 
on top with a red pencil. "Here's 
one I was planning to run in 
an early issue of Your Wife and 
Mine, About how the neat, wellgroomed man always gets the 
highest paying job. You see, 
we're trying to get at the men 
through the women. I wish you'd 
see if you can't liven it up a bit. 
I think it needs more of the 
feminine slant." 

"I'll do my best," Linda 
promised. 

Simpson fished another manuscript from the pile. 

"Now here's an article for 
Scepter called Nine Paths to the 
Altar. Try and think up another 
one if you can. I think it would 
sound much stronger if we could 
make it an even ten." 

"Much," said Linda, writing 
a Ten over the Nine, 

Simpson shuffled the papers 
awkwardly laying down one and 



picking up another as if debating 
how to proceed. 

"Er . . .I'd like to get your 
reaction to an idea Carson submitted for an advertisement recently. Carson's in charge of our 
sanitary products plant now, you 
know. He thinks it might go over 
big with the women if we ran 
a full page photograph in color 
of Queen Hortense standing by 
the balcony looking kind of 
pensive, with the one word 
WHY underneath." 

Linda shook her head very 
slowly. "I'd turn thumbs down 
if I were you." 

Simpson heaved a sigh. 

"Same way I felt," he told 
her, apparently much relieved. 
"There's some of these things 
you can't push too fast." 

He leaned back and tapped the 
pencil thoughtfully between his 
teeth. 

"Curious how hard it is to 
make people do things for their 
own good. Been fighting it all 
my life. Remember what a time 
I had on Earth, changing the 
eating habits of the nation. You 
couldn't get 'em to take a bite 
of kidney or brain or spleen for 
love nor money. Best part of a 
cow according to the docs, but 
there was a strong tradition 
against it. Practically had to ram 
it down their throats at first. 
Now I suppose I'm up against 
the same proposition here." 



impson's hair is certainly 
getting thinner, Rawlins thought. 
And those lines around his eyes 
certainly weren't there a year ago. 
And was it his imagination, or 
did the tips of Simpson's handkerchief droop ever so slightly? 

"Speaking of meat, did I tell 
you I'd started importing livestock?" Simpson asked, brightening up a little. "Just got in a 
prize Holstein bull-calf named 
Beau James the Fourth and a 
young heifer named Royal Betsy 
of Green Acres. Jim and Betsy 
we call 'em for short. I'm planning to build up a whole herd. 
One thing I've missed on Venus 
is my glass of fresh milk at 
bedtime." 

"That must have been quite a 
job, ferrying in a bull-calf," 
Rawlins observed. 

"It took some careful planning," Simpson admitted. "I was 
lucky in getting the services of 
an expert vet. Maybe you've 
heard of him Dr. Hoskins. Got 
a regular bedside manner when 
it comes to animals. He brought 
'em through in fine shape. Made 
the trip like old time space men." 
There was a faraway look in 
Simpson's eyes. "You won't believe it, but I used to be able to 
milk cows when I was a boy. 
Probably lost the knack of it 
QOW." 

He sighed and returned to the 
papers. 



SON 29 

"I've picked out half a dozen 
articles from the stuff we've run 
in our other magazines during 
the past year. See if you can't 
cut it down about half for our 
digest magazine. Easiest way is 
to leave out the explanations. 
People don't like explanations. 
Best way is just to tell 'em 
things." 

Linda turned over some of the 
sheets. "I never did understand 
this one by our psychologist on 
Be Glad You're Broke. First we 
tell the Venusians to work harder 
to make more money and then we 
turn right around and tell 
them how nice it is to be without it." 

"Not the point," Simpson 
grunted. "Point is nobody ever 
makes all the money he wants. 
Stop the first man you meet on 
the street and ask him how he's 
doing. Chances are he'll weep 
on your shoulder. So tell 'em 
something encouraging. Sympathize with 'em. Tell 'em all 
about the little homely things 
of life that are free, like love — 
friendship— faith. You know 
what I mean. How everything 
generally works out for the best 
in the end." 

He heaved a bitter sigh. "Why, 
take my own case, for instance. 
Happiest days of my life were 
when I was a kid back on the 
farm in South Dakota milking 
cows."

"Why don't you go back there 
now?" Rawlins suggested. 

"Gee, if I only could. People 
won't let me, that's why. Never 
get a minute's peace any more." 

He sat up suddenly as if 
struck by an idea. 

"Say, maybe you got something there, Rawlins. How about 
a photograph of me with my 
sleeves rolled up, milking Betsy? 
Ought to make a hit with the 
populace, eh? I could practice 
when nobody was looking." 

"We'll make a note of it," 
Rawlins said. 

Simpson went over the remaining articles in a hurry, using the 
red pencil ruthlessly on some, 
dismissing others with scarcely a 
glance. 

"Main idea to aim for is a 
cheerful, wholesome feeling," he 
told Linda. "How things may 
seem hard now but they'll get 
better if we just keep on 
plugging the way some other 
guys have done. Once in awhile 
we can ran an article criticizing 
something to keep the people 
stirred up a little. But nothing 
really big, you understand." 

He tossed the last paper aside 
and looked inquiringly at Rawlins. "Well, boy, how are you 
doing? Got the dope on that 
housing survey yet?" 

"Well, not exactly in the form 
I'd like it," Rawlins said, reaching for a manila folder. "As you 



know, I've had to train all my 
field workers and that takes time. 
Even after they're trained it's 
hard to get reliable data. The 
Venusians have such a curious 
attitude. It's even hard to convince them of the importance of 
polling them in the first place." 

Simpson nodded impatiently. 
"Okay, so it's tough. Nov/ what 
you got on this housing thing?" 

"Well' it's not too favorable, 
I'm afraid," said Rawlins, indicating a row of figures. "Some 
of the old folks can't get used 
to all that glass and chromium 
plate. Too far from nature, I 
guess. And the men complain 
that they never get to see their 
wives anymore. They claim the 
women spend all their time in 
the bathroom now." 

"It's fantastic," Simpson said. 
"Simply fantastic. After all the 
work we did installing those 
multi-purpose non - bottleneck 
bathroom fixtures. Why a year 
ago they didn't know what a 
bathroom was. Now they got the 
nerve to gripe about how much 
worse off they are." 

He began pacing back and 
forth across the floor nervously 
clasping and unclasping his hands 
behind him. Suddenly he stopped, gravely loosened his belt, 
and stood rigidly at attention 
with his chest thrown out and his 
stomach pulled in. Slowly he 
began to exhale, letting the air 



SIMPSON 



31 



escape from his lungs until a 
gap of a couple of inches appeared between his waistline and 
the top of his pants. Then he 
inhaled, at the same time rising 
to the tips of his toes. He repeated this operation a dozen 
times. After which he stuffed his 
shirt hack into place and gave 
his pants a hitch. 

"Breath control," he explained. "Wonderful way to relax 
when you begin to tighten up. 
Ought to try it sometime." 

He tightened his belt another 
notch. "Now about this housing 
report. . . . There's probably 
nothing the matter except with 
us. Not giving our ideas a chance 
to sink in, maybe. Trying to move 
too fast again. We've got the 
folks all mixed up and confused. Instead of selling 'em on 
our program." 

He lay back with his eyes 
closed and his hands dangling 
limply from his shoulders. 
"Someday you'll notice a 
change," he intoned. "An upsurge. A quickening of interest. 
Then the awakening and the 
rush to get in. We're building 
on a firm technique. It never 
failed on Earth. It won't fail 
us now." 

"But how can you be so sure?" 
Rawlins said, stuffing the papers 
back in the folder. 

Simpson sat up and opened 
his eyes. 



"Because something in here 
tells me it won't," he declared, 
tapping himself on the chest. 
"You want to get those failure 
thoughts out of your mind, my 
boy. Think success thoughts instead. Always remember this — 
it takes energy to fail. But success attracts success. Success — " 

A woman burst into the room 
followed by half a dozen others. 
It took Rawlins a full second to 
recognize the agitated features of 
Hestor Hildegarde. She never 
hesitated, but made straight for 
Simpson. 

"It's happened," she cried. 
"It's happened!" 

Simpson hastily backed away. 
"What's happened?" 

"The beauty program, just 
when I thought it was going to 
be such a flop." 

She clasped her hands together 
in a kind of ecstasy. 

"Here were these poor women 
practically perishing for beauty 
treatments. Here we were practically dying to give it to them. 
And then what happens? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. We 
couldn't make the slightest impression. Not a dent. 

"And then it started. They 
began coming in . . . some of 
the younger ones at first, holding hands as if they were scared 
to death. All so trembly and 
wide-eyed. They were simply 
precious. Then they began com

ing in threes and fours. Then 
in droves. Now we're positively 
swamped — covered up." 

She flung her arms around 
Simpson and planted a resounding smack on his check. "Darling, 
they've gone simply wild over 
glamor. You must send back to 
Earth immediately for more of 
everything." 

"Well, that's certainly mighty 
fine," Simpson said, disentangling himself. "That's great. I'll 
tell Ballard Kingsley to get busy 
right away. He's in complete 
charge back there, you know. In 
the meantime, carry on the best 
way you can. But don't let them 
cool off. Keep them coming. 
Promise them anything." 

Simpson drove one fist into 
the palm of his hand. 

"What did I tell you?" he 
said to Rawlins. "It's the awakening ... the rush to get in. Now 
we don't need to wait. We can 
go ahead fast. Ah, I wonder 
what Queen Hortense will say 
now?" 

"Mr. Simpson." 

A tall gaunt man in a white 
gown was standing in the doorway regarding them solemnly. 
Simpson's face broke into a grin. 

"Why, doctor, come in. Come 
in." 

He waved his hand at the 

assembly. 

"Folks, want you to meet 
Doctor Hoskins. Best vet in the 



state of Wisconsin. Trust him 
with my life." 

Doctor Hoskins bowed slightly. "It's about Jim and Betsy that 
I wanted to see you about, Mr. 
Simpson." 

"Well, what about them?" 

"They're dead. Passed out not 
ten minutes ago. I thought you'd 
want to know right away." 

"Dead." Simpson looked bewildered. "But I don't want 
them dead. See here — -I won't 
have them dead." 

"Well, I'm sorry, but they're 
dead just the same. Nobody 
feels it any more than I do." 

He walked into the room, bis 
chin sunk upon his chest. "I 
thought I noticed signs of restlessness about an hour ago. They 
kept threshing around in tneir 
stalls and bawling but I attributed it to the reaction from 
the trip. But when they started 
gasping for breath and getting 
wobbly in the knees I knew 
something was wrong. Their 
symptoms certainly had me 
puzzled. I'd have said it was 
impaction of the omasum except 
that there didn't seem to be 
any bloating worth mentioning. 
Well, I injected pilocarpine and 
when that didn't help I shoved 
in a twentieth of a grain of 
strychnine, but that didn't help 
either. They both died a few 
minutes later." 

News of the double tragedy 



SIMPSON

cast a pall over the room. Even 
Hestor Hildegarde was momentarily subdued. 

"Say, those sound like the 
same symptoms I had the first 
time I ate any Venusian food," 
Rawlins exclaimed. "Tied me up 
in a hard knot. I've had to be 
mighty careful ever since." 

"Yeah," Simpson muttered 
disconsolately, "only thing is you 
pulled through and the cows 
didn't." 

"Under the circumstances I'd 
like to do an autopsy," Doctor 
Hoskins said. "If I can have 
your permission, Mr. Simpson." 

"Sure. Sure," Simpson told 
him. "Go right ahead. And . . . 
thanks for letting me know. ' 

"TT'S the beginning of the 
-I- end," Rawlins declared, 
when everyone had left. He sat 
down in the nearest chair and 
swung his legs over the side. 
"With the women on Simpson's 
side, Queen Hortense is lost." 

"Venus was so different when 
we came here," Linda sighed. "It 
was all so charming and idyllic. 
Now look at it." 

Rawlins regarded her quizzically. 

"So you don't like it now, 
eh? You don't like paneled 
bathrooms, thermo - controlled 
forced air heaters, automatic 
garbage pulverators — " 

"Yes, I like them very much. 



What I don't like is the way 
Simpson keeps us building so 
furiously toward some vague goal 
in the future that we never 
really have the time to savor 
them properly." 

Rawlins sank back lazily in 
his chair. 

"Don't know that I altogether 
agree with you," he told her. "In 
my opinion most of us live in 
a rush because we like it. Give 
the average man everything he 
wants and what happens? Why, 
he's miserable. He doesn't want 
to sit around ' savoring life. He 
wants to devour it as fast as he 
can." 

"Oh, I don't know about that." 
. "Well, it's true whether you 
want to admit it or not. Now 
when it comes to the Venusians 
I'm not so sure. They seem 
simple enough on the surface, 
but in some ways they're pretty 
deep." 

"It's all Simpson's fault," 

"No. We were right in there 
pitching, too." 

"Well, we couldn't help ourselves. That was our job." Suddenly she buried her face in her 
hands. "Oh, I hate Simpson!" 

Rawlins patted her gently on 
the shoulder. "Stop it, Linda. 
You're talking nonsense, you 
know." 

Linda shook her head vigorously. Her sobs came in long, 
intermittent gasps.

"Perhaps Simpson's gods 
aren't our gods, but does that 
mean that ours are any better 
than his?" Rawlins murmured. 
"Now be a good girl and dry 
your eyes." 

Linda sat up and began to 
repair her makeup, an operation 
that consisted chiefly in making 
seemingly ineffectual little dabs 
at her face. The seriousness with 
which Linda approached this task 
held Rawlins fascinated. Although the net change in her 
appearance was insignificant, 
the improvement in her morale 
was apparently immense. Empires 
might totter in the balance, he 
reflected, nations tremble on the 
brink of ruin, and worlds collide, 
but time must stop while a 
woman repairs her makeup. 

Rawlins waited till the last 
infinitesimal bit of lipstick and 
eye-shadow had been applied. 
Then very deliberately he got up 
and sauntered toward the door. 

"Where are you going?" Linda 
asked. 

"Just thought I'd try to see 
Queen Hortense, if I could." 
"What for?" 

"Oh, nothing much. Just an 
idea that occurred to me." 

Linda hurried over beside 
him. "Now, you wait Before 
we see her there's one thing I 
want understood. We're not 
doing anything behind Simpson's 
back. Is that clear?" 



"Say, listen, who invited you 
to come along in the first place?" 

"Well, I'm coming anyhow." 

They faced each other defiantly. Before Linda could move 
Rawlins had grabbed her around 
the waist and aimed a kiss at her 
lips. Linda tried to dude but 
Rawlins had the advantage. 
There was a brief struggle from 
which Rawlins emerged victorious. 

i "As a matter of fact, I thought 
I'd see if Simpson wanted to 
come along," Rawlins said smiling down at her. "Then there 
can't be any doubt about everything being on the up-and-up." 

"Well, I think it would be 
nicer that way," Linda .said, 
reaching for her handbag. "But 
now you'll have to wait till I 
put my face on again." 

The square in front of the 
palace was dark and deserted. 
The only light came from "the 
fire burning in the altar and 
the glow of the aurora shining 
through the thin cirrus clouds. 
Now the aurora resembled long 
tiers of green and violet curtains 
hanging in the sky, shifting, intangible, unreal. Linda shivered. 

"I'd never get used to those 
auroras if I lived on Venus a 
hundred years." 

Rawlins studied the display 
with the detached eye of the 
scientific observer. 

"Venus must have a consider

ably stronger magnetic field than 
the Earth's," he remarked. 
"Magnetic axis probably inclined quite a bit farther from 
the axis of rotation, too." 

Even as they watched the curtains dissolved into nothingness. 
For a moment there was only 
darkness. Then gradually the 
whole sky behind the palace heme suffused by a crimson glow 
e the light from a distant 
rest fire. 

"It's a sign," Linda whispered. 
V warning of danger." 
Rawlins snorted. "Now how 
could an electrical discharge 
through the upper atmosphere of 
Venus conceivably be interpreted 
as a warning placed in the sky 
for our special benefit? A 
remnant of superstitious fear 
from your primitive ancestors, 
:y dear." 

"Next time we come here I 
pe it won't be so confounded 
rk," Simpson growled, staining over a loose flagstone. "I'm 
ing to have a fountain installed 
the middle of the square with 
lored lights that go on and 
. Runs through the whole rainw every two minutes. Ought to 
ok pretty nice, don't you 
ink?" 

Rawlins nodded. "Who says 
we haven't got art on Venus?" 
The palace loomed black 
;ainst the red auroral glow. The 
door at the entrance stood wide 



open as usual revealing the hallway within dimly lighted by 
flickering torches. 

"Doesn't Queen Hortense ever 
lock up the place?" E.awlins 
said. "How does she know somebody won't try to run off with 
the crown jewels?" 

"I wanted to put in electric 
burglar alarms and floodlights," 
Simpson said, "but she wouldn't 
hear of it. Claimed the people 
would think she was crazy." 

They found a young girl seated 
near the door playing some 
stringed instrument. She smiled 
as they approached, while -her 
fingers continued to ripple over 
the strings. If she felt any resentment toward the people who 
had usurped the position of her 
queen it was not apparent from her manner. 

"We wonder- if Queen Hortense could see us for a few 
minutes?" Rawlins inquired. 
"Tell her we apologize for intruding in this way but there 
was a matter came up we'd like 
to get settled at once if we 
could." 

"I'll go see," the girl said, laying aside her instrument. "You 
can wait over there on that 
bench." 

It was the first time Rawlins 
had been in the palace since they 
had set up temporary offices in 
one of the back rooms more 
than a year ago. There was a 



36 COSMOS SC 

delightful air of ease and informality about the queen's domestic 
establishment that he found distinctly restful. Strolling down the 
long halls with their al fresco 
type of architecture, the profusion of blossoms overflowing 
from the vases on every side, and 
the girls in their casual white 
tunics, always gave him the sensation of having inserted himself 
into one of those Maxneld 
Parrish scenes that used to hang 
over every mantelpiece in the 
land. Except that the blue vitriol 
sky was missing. 

"The queen don't go in much 
for improvements," Simpson 
grunted. "You show her a new 
gadget and she just raises one 
eyebrow. Makes you feel like a 
guy pulling rabbits out of a bat. 
It's a cute way to produce rabbits 
but nature can do it so much 
better." 

"Well, I see you've made a 
little progress," Linda remarked, 
nodding toward a door down the 
hall marked Powder Room. 

"Queen Mortense will see you 
now," the girl called down to 
them. "She's waiting for you on 
the balcony." 

The incline to the second level 
grew darker with every jtep. 
They were in the middle of the 
Venusian night; more than a 
week must pass as time is 
reckoned on the Earth before the 
blackness would begin to resolve 



IENCE FICTION 

into the gray that foretold the 
dawn. Nearing the balcony they 
became aware of a vibrant 
twanging sound such as might 
have been made by a man playing a banjo at the bottom of a 
well. The two men paused 
listening intently. 

"Oh, come on," Linda said 
impatiently. "What are you waiting for?" 

They found Hortense reclining 
on her couch a la Madame Recamier as usual, watching the 
dancing figures on the screen of 
her television set. She smiled and 
extended one slim arm in welcome. In her serene presence 
Rawlins immediately felt himself 
endowed with all the social 
graces of an untrained, overgrown puppy. 

There was a constrained 
silence while they sat watching 
the television screen. The illuminated square held their attention enchained. There was no 
escape from it. You could look 
away, but inevitably your eyes 
came back again. Rawlins finally 
gave up and sat staring grimly 
at the characters who never seemed to wear .anything but evening 
clothes. 

"They're so restless," Hortense murmured, turning to 
Simpson. "Are the people in your 
world always so disturbed?" 

"Now you mustn't take these 
pictures of ours too seriously," 


SIMPSON 



37 



he chuckled. "After all they're 
just plays. What we call escape 
drama." 

"Escape drama?" 

"Uh huh. Something to make 
the people laugh. Get their mind 
off their troubles for awhile." 

The picture finally ended with 
a prolonged blast from the orchestra. Queen Hortense snapped off the set leaving the room 
in darkness except for the light 
of a tall candle burning by the 
door. Rawlins subsided gratef idly 
into the shadows. Beyond the 
balcony there was still a dull 
red tinge from the aurora. 

"You've got to pardon us for 
butting in on you this way," 
Simpson began, "but Rawlins 
thought we could speak our mind 
better, alone this way, than if 
we had to keep moving and 
seconding the motion and all that 
junk." 

"It wasn't planned at all," 
Rawlins assured. "We never 
thought about it ourselves till a 
moment ago." 

"You see, here's the situation," 
Simpson hurried on. "It's been 
more'n a year since we made 
that little agreement of ours." 
He chuckled reminiscently. 
"Now, the way things are picking up it strikes me there can't 
be much doubt about the way 
the wind blows. You can see 
for yourself what I've accomplished. When I took over, this 



planet looked like a Dakota farm 
two installments behind on the 
mortgage. Now look at it. Things 
are really humming. A man can 
hope to get somewhere, today." 

Queen Horjense smiled vaguely but did not reply. Rawlins 
could not decide whether she 
failed to comprehend what Simpson was driving at or whether 
she was just bored. She lay on 
the couch with her knees pulled 
up under her, like a child, exposing the soft rounded contour 
of her legs. 

"Now, I know what you're 
probably thinking," Simpson 
said. "You're thinking are the 
people any happier than they 
were before? Well, I don't know. 
Happiness is a funny thing. You 
show me a man who says he's 
happy and I'll show you a man 
who's dead from the neck up. 
Gone to seed. Stagnating. Happy 
people never get very far. It's 
the restless, dissatisfied people 
you've got to thank for all our 
progress. Why, if I felt happy 
for more'n a minute. I'd know 
we were through right then.'' 

"Maybe we are through. All 
through and don't know it." 

The words had escaped Rawlins involuntarily. He heard them 
as if they were spoken by someone else, like a disembodied voice 
on the television screen. 

"I'm surprised to hear a statement like that from a man in 



38 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



my organization." There was a 
hurt note in Simpson's voice. 

"What I meant was ..." 

Rawlins found himself struggling to figure out just what he 
did mean. He knew what he felt, 
but it was hard to get it into 
words. 

"What I mean was . . . Well, 
I ean't help wondering if the 
headed, aggressive people are the 
ones we do have to thank for 
most of our progress. In the 
encyclopaedia you'll find most of 
the names belong to prophets 
and dreamers . . . people who 
didn't seem to amount to much 
in their time. But they had something people liked and so they 
kept on going — " 

"Like what, for instance?" 

"Well . . . well like that candle 
back there by the door. The 
candle should have disappeared 
years ago along with the horse 
and buggy. The candle has had 
all kinds of competition from 
the coal-oil lamp, natural gas, 
and electricity. And yet the 
candle is still going strong. They 
make more candles today than 
ever before in the history of the 
world. 

"It's hard to explain but there's 
something so restful and soothing about candle light. And 
beautiful. A woman never looks 
so beautiful as she does by 
candlelight." He glanced at 
Linda. 



"Okay," Simpson said, "so it's 
beautiful. Well, that's fine. I'm 
all for it. If there's people on 
Venus who want these old 
fashioned gimmicks why they can 
have 'em. We could fix up an 
old time Venusian village. Have 
everything kind of quaint the 
way it used to be. The waitresses 
running around in those little 
nightshirts like they used to wear 
and all that. Make a swell 
tourist attraction. Bound to make 
money if it's promoted right." 

He sighed deeply. 

"But that isn't what I come 
to see you about. Here's the 
point. I don't like the setup here 
at all. I'm the real leader here, 
and yet I've got to keep doing 
business through you all the 
time. Now we ought to get it 
straightened out one way or the 
other. Let the people know which 
one of us is tops." 

"Why don't you let the people 
decide it, then?" Rawlins said 
very casually. 

It took awhile for the idea 
to sink in, but when it finally hit 
bottom the result was explosive. 

"By God, why don't we?" 
Simpson cried. "Put it up to 'em 
straight. Have an election." 

"An election?" Queen Hortense looked from one to the 
other bewildered. "I'm afraid I 
don't understand." 

"The people vote on it — see? 
You ask 'em: 'Do you want to 



SIMPSON 



39 



string along with Queen Hortense or do you want to go ahead 
with Simpson?' Now what could 
be fairer than that?" 

"But my people love me," 
Hortense protested. "They 
would never choose against 
me." 

"Listen," said Simpson impatiently, "why don't we make 
a deal? You turn the reins over 
to me. You can go on living 
here as queen but I want full 
authority and I want the people 
to know it. Of course, if you 
still think you have a chance." 

"Oh, but I have. I know I 
have." 

Linda laid her hand on the 
queen's arm. "Don't you understand? You had better take Mr. 
Simpson's offer. The people are 
fascinated by this new way of 
life. They are flocking to him. 
You must believe it." 

Looking at the queen Rawlins 
thought what a forelorn figure 
she made lying there brooding 
over what Linda had told her. 
He had never felt so sorry fox 
anyone in his life. 

"There is a temple outside the 
city not so far from where you 
landed," Hortense said. "A little 
temple just off the highway hidden by trees and flowers. Where 
lovers often go strolling hand 
in hand." 

"I think I remember it," Rawlins told her. "A little stone 



building almost hidden by the 
jungle." 

■ "You will find my answer 
there in the temple," Hortense 
said. "If you ever go there. 
It has been so many years 
now — " 

"Someday we'll ' have a long 
talk about that temple of yours," 
Simpson interrupted. "But the 
question before the house now 
is whether we hold this election 
or not. Whichever one of us 
wins, the other steps down and 
out. That's got to be definitely 
understood." 

"Wait a minute," Rawlins told 
him. "Naturally you'd win. 
When you've got complete control of every means of reaching 
the people. What kind of an 
agreement is that?" 

"Ah, what's the difference? 
You know she hasn't got a 
prayer." 

"Who says she hasn't?" Rawlins blazed. "You let me handle 
her on a fair and equal basis 
and we'll see whether she's got 
a chance or not." 

Simpson regarded him calmly. 

"You think so?" 

'Yes'" 

"All right then go ahead. Consider yourself official palace 
campaign manager. I'll guarantee 
you get equal rights on all channels of public communication. 
Okay?" 

"Okay/ 



40 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



Simpson rubbed his hands 
briskly. 

"Long time since I've been in 
a good, red-hot political campaign," he said, grinning at 
Linda. "I'm going to get a lot 
of fun out of this. Wonder 
what Ballard Kingsley will think 
when he hears about this? Good 
old Kingsley! Boy, the times we 
used to have together." 

He hooked his arm into 
Linda's. 

"Well, good-bye, folks. Suppose we hold the election one 
terrestrial month from now. 
We'll be seeing you then. And 
don't forget, my boy, I'm counting on you to make it a good 
one." 

With a wave of his hand he 
was gone with Linda along with 
him. 

Rawlins sank down on the 
couch beside Hortense. Being 
alone with her frightened him 
in a way. It was first time he had 
ever had her beauty all to himself to examine at leisure. He 
fell to studying her face and 
figure minutely. God, what loveliness was hers. was like the 
radiance of an opium dream . . 
a wild, eerie, unearthly beauty. 
That was the word he wanted — 
unearthly. A beauty that was not 
of the Earth. 

The music of the stringed instrument floated up from the 
hall, singing of a sadness that 



was all the sweeter because of 
its utter hopelessness. The candle 
flame burned in the still air 
without a tremor. Queen Hortense lay back at full length, a 
dreamy expression in her eyes, 
with one arm dangling languidly 
over her side of the couch. 
Rawlins felt her hand against his, 
yet he made no move to touch 
her. 

His feelings toward Queen 
Hortense were very complex, 

VII 

""KTOW give me that again," 
X™ Rawlins said into the 
telephone. "Simpson 58 per cent, 
Hortense 35 per cent, 7 per cent 
undecided." He scribbed the 
figures down on a pad of paper. 
"Have much trouble polling the 
people in that octant? Hmm. 
Well, don't worry about it now. 
The returns will begin coming 
in soon. Then we won't have to 
worry. We'll know." 

An unnatural quiet hung over 
the Queen Hortense campaign 
headquarters. Despite the tireless 
efforts of the ventilating system 
the air was thick with tobacco 
smoke. A dozen men and women 
were disposed around the room 
in attitudes betokening deep dejection. The floor and furniture 
were littered with newspapers, 
colored stickers, and printed 
handouts. Several of the persons 



SIMPSON 



41 



present wore large buttons which 
posed the question WHO BUT 
HORTENSE? 

One side of the room was 
dominated by a more-than-lifesize photograph of Queen Hottense seated at a desk, her face 
turned around almost full view 
toward the camera. The picture 
gave the impression that it had 
been taken by some stealthy lensman who had stolen into the 
palace and snapped her majesty 
unawares while she was immersed deep in the affairs of 
state. There was an expression 
of gentle reproach in the queen's 
expression that said, more plainly 
than words, "How could you 
do this to me?" The photograph 
had taken sixty man hours on 
the part of an expert camera crew 
to reproduce, and Rawlins regarded it as little short of a 
masterpiece. 

Trouble had dogged his steps 
from the start. First, the queen 
had balked at being photographed at all, and then, after her 
consent, she had been so delighted by the process that they 
were forced to include her entire 
retinue, including the maidens 
who had participated in the 
Festival of Fire. This would not 
have been such a job if the picture had turned out decently. But 
the faces that had come up from 
the bottom of the developing 
bath had been startling to say 



the least. Thus, Queen Hortense, 
when printed, had persisted in 
turning out a smooth, glistening 
white, as if she had first been 
sandpapered and then sprayed 
with aluminum paint. The effect 
was finally traced to an infra-red 
dye in the film which gave no 
trouble in portrait photography 
on the Earth, but was disastrous 
when applied to the Venusian 
physiognomy. 

Rawlins was mulling over some 
figures when Stracker sauntered 
into the room. The physician tapped him lightly on the shoulder. 

"Take it easy," he admonished. 
"Maybe it won't be as bad as 
you think." 

Rawlins shoved the papers 
aside. "I'm crazy to get into this 
business in the first place. To 
think I could beat a man like 
Simpson." 

He kicked a chair in Strackei's 
direction. 

"Sit down and take it easy. 
Results will be coming in any 
time now. How' re things with 
the opposition? Getting all set 
for the big celebration, I suppose." 

"Not exactly," Stracker replied 
easily. "I should say their attitude might be described as one 
of quiet confidence. Hoping for 
the best with their fingers 
crossed." 

"Well, they might as well uncross 'em now," Rawlins growl


42 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



ed. "Take a look at this. The 
final results of our complete 
comprehensive survey." 

Stracker gave the sheet a 
casual glance. "I understand 
people who take polls have been 
known to make mistakes. Or 
hadn't you heard?" 

"Listen," Rawlins snorted impatiently, "these results have been 
checked and rechecked by every 
sampling technique ever invented. We've gotten three times 
the amount of material we need 
to get a reliable result. Even 
admitting an error of seven or 
eight per cent, we're still way 
in the hole. Nope. No use kidding ourselves. Hortense is out 
and Simpson in." 

Stracker picked up a campaign 
folder and began creasing it back 
and forth between his long 
firm fingers. "Soyou're thoroughly convinced of the reliability of 
your figures?" 

"Well, I'm as sure as anyone 
can be about data of that sort." 

"Congratulations," Stracker 
murmured. "In that case you're 
way out ahead of us." 

"How's that?" 

"As chief of the medical staff 
you know I've had general supervision of a lot of measurements 
and tests we've made on the 
Venusians. From similar measures on the Earth we thought we 
knew about what to expect. We 
knew, for example, that while 



the average height of different 
races varies considerably yet the 
distribution in height is always 
the same. Invariably follows the 
normal or Gaussian law. One of 
the fundamental attributes of 
homo sapiens." 

"Yes?" said Rawlins. 

"Well, the Venusians don't fit 
into a normal law. Instead the 
distribution in their heights is 
decidedly skew. You can't tell a 
bunch of Venusians from a 
bunch of us just by looking at us. 
But you let me measure their 
heights and I can tell you which 
is which as soon as I can plot their 
histograms." 

"The hell you can." 

"Fact," Stracker declared, 
"They're peculiar in other ways, 
too. Their basal metabolism is 
considerably lower than ours. 
And their pituitary gland isn't 
so well developed. Same goes for 
the thymus in the males, although it appears to be about the 
same in the women. Then, take 
the period of gestation — " 

"All very interesting," Rawlins observed dryly, "but what's 
that got to do with the election?" 

"Nothing, probably," Stracker 
admitted. "I was just trying to 
lighten the gloom around here 
a little." 

Rawlins scowled at the clock 
over the door. "Polls must have 
closed half an hour ago. What's 



SIMPSON 



43 



the matter with our election machinery?" 

He waited impatiently. 

"I think it's coming in now," 
someone called from the vicinity 
of the television set. 

"First report from Octant 
Seven,*" a voice rasped. "Results 
have been slow, owing to our 
unfamiliarity with election procedure, but we shall make every 
effort to keep you informed as 
rapidly as possible. As you know, 
Octant Seven is the wildest and 
most desolate. ..." 

"Just give us the results," said 
Rawlins. 

"... scattered returns out of 
an estimated two hundred thousand votes. Let's see . . . we have 
1580 for Simpson . . . 720 for 
Queen Hortense. As I said 
before, these are only the first 
scattered returns from Octant 
Seven. ..." 

"Oh, lord, it's going to be 
worse than I thought," Rawlins 
groaned, watching the figures go 
up on the blackboard. "It 
wouldn't make any difference if 
the Venusians were full of buckshot and their veins flowed pure 
Gordon gin. We still couldn't 
win this election." 

"... coming in faster now. 
To save time I'll only give you 
the approximate figures. Twenty 
thousand votes out of an estimated three million in Octant 
One — " 



"Octant One! That's us!" 
Rawlins cried. 

". . , first returns give twelve 
thousand for Simpson against 
eight thousand for Queen Hortense. These results are from 
densely populated areas where 
the queen's, strength was reputedly stronger. . 

'■'Now that wasn't so bad," 
Stracker observed encouragingly, 

"Just about the way the poll 
indicated," Rawlins said. "No 
use. It's all over but the shouting." 

The voice droned on. The 
votes piled up steadily for Simpson. Rawlins stood it for another, twenty minutes. Then he 
jerked a finger at one of his 
men. 

"I'm going out. When I get 
back, I'll write a message of» 
congratulation to Simpson, you 
get Hortense to sign it, and make 
sure it reaches all the papers 
along with the usual felicitations 
and what not. Understand?" 

The man nodded. "When will 
you be back?" 

"Oh, hell, I don't know. Pretty 
soon. In a couple of hours maybe." He hurried out of the room. 

Outside, the dawn was beginning to struggle through the 
clouds banked in the east. 



•As there are so few natural boundaries on Venus, one of Simpson's first 
acts was to divide the planet arbitrarily 
into eight octants. 



44 



COSMOS SCIB«CE FICTION 



Rawlins' footsteps echoed across 
the vacant square with a hollow 
sound. The palace was dark except for the light at the entrance. 
He was suddenly filled with a 
vast rage toward Queen Hortense. Here he had been killing 
himself for the last month trying 
to keep her in power, and she 
couldn't even bother to listen to 
the election returns. 

After several more blocks he 
came to a long low building with 
blank walls sloping smoothly 
from the sidewalk. He entered a 
door and approached the 
Venusian clerk, behind a glassenclosed counter. 

"Tell Miss Linda King I want 
to see her," he barked into the 
transmitter. 

The clerk smiled apologetically. "I'm afraid Miss King is 
occupied at present. If you wish 
to send in a message — " 

"You tell Linda King I want 
to see her right now or I'll bust 
this glass cage and you along 
with it!" 

"Yes, sir!" 

The youth hastily punched 
some buttons and addressed some 
words into the transmitter at his 
side. 

"Miss King says she'll be out 
in a minute. If you'll take a seat 
and wait — " 

"I'll wait!" 

A few minutes later a door 
opened in the wall and Linda 



rushed out. "Rawlins, what is 
it? I couldn't imagine you calling 
me." 

"Oh, I couldn't stand it any 
longer," he blurted, seizing her 
in his arms. "This damned election's got me all unstrung. I had 
to see you. Let's go off some place 
where we can be by ourselves 
and talk." 

Linda looked doubtful. "I 
don't know. I'm supposed to be 
helping with the election. Simpson will be counting on me." 

"Confound it, didn't you hear 
me?" Rawlins cried. "I said I 
wanted to be alone with you." 

Linda stood hesitating, her 
body rigid within his grasp. Then 
she yielded all at once. "All 
right. Where shall we go?" 

"Let's visit that little temple 
the queen mentioned. It's only a 
short walk from here." 

The wind blowing from the 
east was fresh against their faces. 
All Rawlins' fatigue had vanished in an instant. The sense of 
Linda's nearness exhilarated him 
beyond measure. The feel of her 
bare hand in his, the delicious 
sense of femininity about her, 
the pressure of her body, soft 
and yielding against his arm. . . . 
He rushed on breathlessly, his 
feet scarcely seeming to touch 
the ground. 

After about half a mile the 
pavement ended, forcing them 
to keep to the footpath along 



SIMPSON 



45 



the edge of the highway through 
which they had first entered the 
city. 

"The path should be about in 
here," Rawlins said, scanning the 
tangled shrubs and vines that 
encroached upon the road. 
"You'd never find it unless you 
were on the lookout for it." 

"What's that over there?" 
Linda asked, pointing to a break 
in the wall of vegetation. 

"That's it. It was farther from 
town than I thought." 

They plunged into the rank 
growth, walking single file 
through the winding pathway. 
The vegetation was so thick that 
at times they were unable to see 
ten feet ahead. But there was no 
danger of losing their way, as 
the path although narrow was 
well marked. Presently they came 
out into an open grassy space 
with a low stone building in the 
center, surrounded by flowering 
shrubs and vines. 

"Lovely!" Linda cried, as if enchanted. "'And not another person in sight." 

"All home listening to the 
election, probably," Rawlins <:aid. 

They strolled around the 
temple arm-in-arm exclaiming 
over the picturesque ruin with 
its unexpected nooks and corners 
and its seats half -hidden by lacy 
vines dripping with white and 
purple blossoms. The leaves 
stirring in the morning breeze 



gave forth a fresh, lemony scent, 

"Well, we seem to have the 
place all to ourselves," Rawlins 
said, after a brief tour of inspection. "Shall we sit down on 
one of these benches here?" 

"I suppose we might as well," 
Linda agreed. 

They sat huddled close together, breathing in the fragrance 
from the flowers and watching 
the shimmering pattern made by 
the yellow sunshine filtering 
through the trees. 
. "You know, if there was a nice 
secluded spot like this in 
southern California they'd never 
be able to let it alone," Rawlins 
said. "Somebody would be sure 
to install a hot-dog and softdrink stand." 

Linda smiled and nodded comfortably. Rawlins brushed the 
side of her cheek with his lips. 

"And slot machines," she said. 
"Slot machines full of cigarettes 
and popcorn and candy bars." 

Rawlins gave her a long 
lingering kiss on the lips. Linda 
reached up and drew him down 
closer beside her. 

"I'd forgotten the slot machines," he mumbled. The blood 
was racing in his veins. He was 
glowing all over. 

"Coke bottles, too," Linda 
whispered. "Don't forget the 
coke bottles." 

"That's right. There's always 
coke bottles."

COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



Linda pressed her lips hard 
against his. Rawlins drew her to 
him fiercely; his fingers were 
stealing over her, dosing around 
her tighter. . . . 

"Maybe we ought to be going." Linda sighed at last, 
smoothing down her hair. 
"They'll think it's funny if we're 
gone so long." 

"They'll think it's funny anyhow," Rawlins grunted, making 
no effort to move. 

Linda deftly applied lipstick 
to form a bow on her upper lip. 
"Wonder what Queen Hortense 
meant when she said we'd find 
why Simpson would fail in this 
temple?" 

Rawlins yawned. "Don't 
know. To tell the truth I'd forgotten all about it." 

"Let's see if we can find out," 
said Linda with sudden energy, 
pulling Rawlins to his feet beside her. "I don't think she'd 
have been talking for the fun 
of it." 

They wandered in and out 
among the passageways of the 
temple pausing occasionally to 
examine some inscription or 
symbol carved on the walls and 
pillars. Many of the markings 
had been nearly defaced by 
weathering or the chemical action of the plant that overspread 
the gray walls. On Venus, as on 
the Earth, lichen was the hardiest 
of growing things, preparing the 



way for higher forms of 
vegetation and clinging tenaciously to life after they were 
gone. 

"And the meek shall inherit 
the Earth," Rawlins said, inspecting the greenish scale that 
covered the rock. "We think 
we're pretty good, but this lichen 
will outlast us all." 

"Look at this," Linda said, 
bending over some inscriptions 
carved on the polished surface of 
a block of granite. "This looks 
fairly new." 

"So it is," said Rawlins, running his fingers over the letters. 
"I'd say this was put here less 
than five years ago." 

"Do you know what it 
means?" 

"I'd guess these figures here 
are dates with some descriptive 
text alongside. I think they're 
an archaic form of Venusian 
type, similar to our Roman 
numerals." 

They started reluctantly toward the narrow path that led 
back to the highway. The sun 
shining through the mist enveloped the temple in a haze of 
golden Jight. 

"I'll always think of it as 
ours," said Linda. "Those stone 
pillars and the little love seats 
with the flowers growing over 
them." 

Rawlins stood looking back 
frowning slightly. "Say, that'* 



SIM! 

funny. I hadn't noticed that before." 

"What's funny?" 

"See how ail those old tree 
trunks in back of the temple are 
lying parallel to one another. 
There isn't a single grown tree 
among them. As if something 
had plowed through there and 
knocked them all down." 

The evidence was plain 
enough when they could view the 
region as a whole from a distance. 

"There's something back there 
partially hidden by those bushes 
but I can't make out what it is 
from here," Rawlins said, shading his eyes. "Do you see what 
I mean?" 

"I think so. Something big 
and black like an animal coiled 
up." 

"Yeah. Only it must be an 
awful big animal to make a coil 
that size. He gave her arm a 
squeeze. "You stay here. I'm 
going in there to take a look." 

Before Linda could protest he 
was across the cleared space and 
into the jungle, threading his 
way among the shrubs and vines 
that covered the ground to his 
knees. He was forced to penetrate 
the tangled undergrowth to a 
distance of some fifty yards before he reached the dark circular 
object protruding from the 
ground. He circled around it 
warily, studying it from a variety 



ON 47 

of angles, finally ending by 
scraping at the side of it with 
his pocket knife. When he rejoined Linda his face was grave. 

"I think we've found something," he told her, knocking 
some fragments of mold from 
his shoes. "It looks to me like the 
section of a spaceship. A ship 
that probably landed about five 
years ago, judging from the 
height of the trees growing 
around it. When you scrape away 
the dirt from the side you can 
see it's metal instead of rock. '' 

The clouds in the east were 
drifting over the sun turning 
the scene from bright morning 
into gray twilight. The golden 
mist that had enveloped the 
temple had faded, leaving it a 
dull, commonplace mass of stones 
eaten by the green lichen. 

"Furthermore," Rawlins declared, "I've got a powerful 
hunch what this place was meant 
to be now. It's all very picturesque and charming, isn't it? 
A nice little hideaway for lovers. 
But I don't believe it was ever 
built for that purpose originally. 
I think it's a tomb. A tomb 
where the bodies of the men are 
buried who have tried to conquer this planet in the past and 
failed. And those figures on the 
stone are all that remains of 
them." 

He gave a low chuckle. "For 
the last hour we've been necking 



48 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



over the graves of our companions of the past." 

They found the highway 
singularly deserted for such a 
late hour. The few travellers 
abroad eyed them suspiciously 
and hurried on. Rawlins was oppressed by an overpowering sense 
of longing and homesickness for 
Earth. Lately he had come to regard Venus almost as home, a 
place in many respects not so 
different from the land where 
he had grown up as a boy. Now 
he felt himself a stranger in a 
strange land. Everything inspired 
him with dread — the everpresent clouds, the lingering 
night and day, the three volcanoes smoldering on the 
horizon. As Stracker said, how 
much did they really know about 
the Venusians? They resembled 
human beings and in many ways 
they behaved like human 
beings. But were they? Was 
there any real kinship between 
them? 

At the entrance to Simpson's 
headquarters they kissed and 
parted with scarcely a word 
spoken. How different their meeting had been a scant hour before, 
Rawlins thought. Then, they nad 
been riding on the crest of the 
wave. Now they were down in 
the depths. All dead inside. 

He strode down the hall to his 
office, uncomfortably aware that 
he had been gone an inordinate 



length of time. Oh, well, what 
the hell? He set his lips in a 
firm line and pushed open the 
door. 

The room was a shambles. 
There was paper all over the 
floor. The tables and desks were 
littered with cigarette stubs and 
coffee cups. Through the blue 
haze men and women could be 
discerned shouting at each other 
above the blast of words issuing 
from the television set. There 
was a hush as Rawlins entered. 
He felt himself shrinking under 
Stracker's inquiring gaze. 

"Well, where have you been 
keeping yourself?" 

"I just stepped out for a few 
minutes," Rawlins retorted. "Got 
any objections?" 

"Not in the least. Only it's too 
bad you missed the fireworks is 
all." 

Rawlins heart gave a leap. 

"Fireworks. What fireworks?" 
He knew he mustn't hope but he 
couldn't stop himself. Couldn't 
suppress the fierce yearning that 
surged up within him. , 

"You remember how Simpson 
looked like a dead cinch for 
first there at the start?" Stracker 
chuckled. "Well, it went on that 
way for about half an hour after 
you left. Then Hortense began 
to gain. Before she'd finished 
she'd taken the whole southern 
hemisphere and was running 
even in Octants One and Three. 



SIMPSON 



49 



Never known anything so thrilling in my life." 

A violent trembling seized 
Rawlins that he was unable to 
control. "Don't tell me . . . she 
won?" 

The doctor shook his head 
regretfully. "No, she didn't win. 
But she certainly upset the dope 
bucket. Simpson came in ahead 
by less than two per cent." 

VIII 

RAWLINS sat down a bit 
unsteadily. "I guess I'm a 
hell of a prognosticator," he said. 

"It's ridiculous to think you 
can understand these people 
overnight," Stracker said. "When 
we can't understand ourselves 
yet." 

"Yeah." Rawlins stretched out 
in the chair. He felt exhausted. 

Stracker brought him a cup 
of water from the cooler. Rawlins 
took it gratefully. 

"Another thing I don't like 
about this planet is the water," 
said Rawlins, sipping the liquid 
thoughtfully. "If I drink more 
than about a teaspoonful at a 
time it makes me sick." 

"That's right. You were one 
- of those that folded up at the 
Festival of Fire, weren't you?" 
"I sure was. Never been so 
ck in my life." 
"Maybe you were never meant 
be an arsenicophagist then." 



"No I guess not — whatever 
it is." 

"An arsenic eater. A person 
who takes arsenic habitually." 

Rawlins set down the cup with 
a jerk. "You mean this water's 
got arsenic in it?" 

The doctor grinned reassuringly. 

"You develop a tolerance to 
it after awhile. Besides, arsenic's 
supposed to improve your looks. 
Makes your hair nice and 
lustrous. Gives you a pretty pink 
complexion." 

"Why in hell doesn't Simpson 
have the water distilled?" 

The doctor shrugged. "Apparently our chemistry department is too busy turning out 
cosmetics to bother with such 
non-essential activities. To be 
perfectly frank, I don't know for 
a fact that the water does contain 
arsenic, but the symptoms strongly suggest such a poison. In any 
case, it's probably only a trace." 

Now that the election was 
finally over Rawlins could see 
that his staff was as dead beat as 
himself. What a thoroughly good 
bunch they were, he thought. 
How faithfully they had labored 
for what they must have known 
in their hearts was a hopeless 
cause. And how few of them 
there were, when you came to 
think of it. After more than a 
year on Venus they were still 
virtually isolated. For the first 



50 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



time it struck him as very strange. 
One of the few facts that had 
stuck in his head from a course 
in anthropology was the statement that no two races, no matter 
how dissimilar, had ever lived 
in proximity without there being 
some intermingling between 
them. Yet he was certain that 
no one there in the room had 
mated with a Venusian. 

He was pondering over the 
implications of this discovery 
when Simpson came in followed 
by the major members of his 
committee. If they felt victorious 
they failed to show it. Only 
Simpson had made an effort to 
maintain appearances. He looked 
tired but spruce, like a man who 
had tried to freshen up after an 
all-night poker party. 

The two groups eyed each 
other wanly. Rawlins cleared the 
debris from a couple of chairs. 

"Greetings. Sit down. Congratulations. Didn't expect you 
over quite so soon. We were mst 
sitting here feeling sorry for 
ourselves." 

"I saw no point in prolonging 
the agony," Simpson said, with 
a bleak smile. "The split over 
the election was purely artificial. 
We still constitute one force 
bound together by the same 
mutual aims and interests. Cooperation. Spiritual welfare. 
Moral integrity. Henceforth let 
those be our watchwords." 



He took a slip of paper from 
his inside coat pocket and adjusted his bifocals. 

"A message came a few minutes ago which I thought you 
might like to hear. It is from 
Ballard Kings! ey, our representative on Earth. He says: * 

Dear Friends — ■ 

We at home rejoice in your 
victory and pledge again' our 
faith in the success of the 
great enterprise upon which 
you are engaged. Be assured 
that we are as one with you in 
our hearts and thoughts.' " 

Simpson replaced the message 
in his coat pocket along with his 
bifocals. For a moment he stood 
quietly contemplating the top of 
the desk as if in deep meditation. 
At length he reached down and 
moved a glass of water two 
inches to the right. 

"While the results of the election were coming in I was thinking," he said. He paused briefly 
waiting for the effect of this 
announcement to sink in. 

"What was I flunking? I was 
thinking that the time had come 
for a great summing up. A 
visible demonstration of all we 
have tried to do for the people 
here. An exhibition that would 
show them in a vivid dramatic 
form how their lives have been 
enriched by the fruits of out 



SIMPSON 



51 



unty. In other words, how far 
ey've come since we landed." 
He moved the glass of water 
'O inches back to its original 
sition. 

"And so I've decided that 
"re going to have an interanctary exposition. An exposin the likes of which nobody 
Earth or Venus has ever 
reamed before. And we're going 
"'er the women. — hard. One of 
e big things I've planned is the 
lie of Beauty. A place where a 
oman can go in a hattsfrau at 
»e end and come out a glamor 
'rl at the other. Can't you just 
e the excitement a thing like 
at'll stir up? Can't you see a 
"Oman's husband, and the neigh~rs, standing around the exit 
icing for her to come out? 
. hy, it'll be the greatest thing 
'nee they invented twin beds." 
He stopped and looked around 
e room expectantly. Nobody 
oved. Nobody spoke. 
"Well . . . anybody 7 got any 
J eas?" 

There was an uneasy silence. 
Somebody coughed in the back 
of the room. 

"It'll have to be plenty good, 
J.D. That's , all I've got to say. 
Hie women are beginning to drift 
back to their old ways already. 
They're only interested till the 
Velty wears off. You don't get 
any customer loyalty in this 
place." 



"All right, it will be good 
then," Simpson retorted. 'It's 
our job to make it good. And 
right now's the time to start. 
The election's over. Forget it. 
This exposition's the thing now. 
I want the publicity started on 
it immediately." 

The men and women remained 
slumped in their chairs. An 
apathy seemed to weigh them 
down, which even Simpson was 
unable to dispel. 

"I'd suggest we take a little 
time out," Stracker interposed. 
"We're exhausted from this 
campaign. A short rest would be 
good for us all." 

"Rest!" There was acid in 
Simpson's voice. "Fine. Anybody 
wants a rest go ahead and take 
it. I've got work to do." 

He turned on his heel and 
strode over to where Rawlins 
was leaning against the filing 
cabinet. 

"That was a great fight you put 
up, boy," he cried, seizing 
Rawlins' hand and pumping it 
vigorously. "Brilliant campaign. 
Enjoyed every minute of it." 

Rawlins shook hands limply. 
"Nobody was more surprised 
than I at the way it turned out. 
I never thought we had a 
chance. " 

"Any idea what went wrong?" 

"No, I honestly haven't. I 
want you to understand I'm not 
offering any alibis. If I had to 



52 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



do it all over again I'd do it 
exactly the same way. If you're 
dissatisfied with the results I'll 
be glad to step out anytime." 

"Now who said anything about 
stepping out? Besides you can't. 
Got too much work lined up 
for you. Maybe this business of 
polling people is a lot of hooey. 
I've always said I'd trust my 
hunches against a bunch of 
figures any day." 

He beckoned to Linda. "I want 
to get your reaction to this Mile 
of Beauty idea. Give Hestor 
Hildegarde a buzz. We'll meet 
over in my office and start laying 
it out. Rawlins, you better come 
along. I'll be right with you soon 
as I have a word with one of the 
boys." 

Linda joined Rawlins by the 
filing cabinet. 

"He's wonderful, isn't he?" 
she whispered, unable to keep the 
admiration from her voice. 
"You'd never guess he's been 
without sleep for thirty-six hours, 
would you?" 

Rawlins cast a sidelong glance 
in Simpson's direction. "Oh, I 
don't know. He looks kind of 
peaked to me." 

Simpson came back, rubbing 
his hands briskly. "Now. Shall 
we be on our way?" 

He stopped, arrested by a sharp 
rattling series of reports from 
outside. There was a momentary 
silence. Then more reports, fol


lowed by screams and a confusion 
of cries. 

"Goodness. What was that?" 
Linda gasped. 

Rawlins shook his head listening intently. There came another 
series of reports followed by more 
cries. The character of the sound 
was unmistakable now. 

The room came to life in an 
instant. The Earthmen were on 
their feet, clustering around 
Simpson. 

"That sounded like rifle fire." 

"It sure did." 

"But who on earth — " 

"Hey! Somebody's coming 
down the hall!" 

A man flung open the door. 
He stood on the threshhold, 
gasping for breath, staring at 
them wildly. His coat and shirt 
were torn and bloodstained, and 
one arm hung limply. He staggered over toward Simpson. 

"We're attacked," he gasped. 
"They broke into the cosmetics 
plant. We never had a chance." 

Simpson eyed him sharply. 
"Who do you mean by 'they'?" 

"I don't know. All I know is 
that a little while ago we heard 
some high-thrust rockets coming 
in. There weren't any flights 
scheduled, but we were so busy 
talking about the election we 
didn't pay much attention." 

He stopped gulping for breath. 

"Next thing we knew here a 
bunch of these fellows came 



SIMPSON 



53 



barging in and told us they were 
taking over. When we told them 
to get the hell out they conked 
a couple of us and tied up the 
rest. There's wasn't anything we 
could do. They were armed and 
we weren't. I managed to sneak 
out through the packaging room 
and tore over here fast as I could. 
I'd have made it quicker but one 
of 'em took a shot at me as I was 
crossing the square." 

He felt of his arm ginger
ly-. 

"You mean they were men like 
us?" said Simpson. "Men from 
the Earth?" 

"I don't know. I guess so. 
That's the way they looked to 
me." 

All eyes were on Simpson. He 
stood nervously clasping and unclasping his hands. Then he 
jammed his hat on his head. 
"Come on. We'll settle this thing 
right now." 

They headed automatically for 
the square with Simpson in the 
lead. The excitment acted on him 
like a tonic. His eyes were alive, 
and there was new elasticity in 
his step. 

"Rawlins, you know the queen 
better than any of us. D'you think 
she could be behind a thing like 
this?" 

"Not a chance. It's not in the 
least like her." 

"I wonder. She's a smart 
woman. I'm afraid I've always 



underestimated her. It never pays 
to underestimate a woman." 

Rawlins was about to reply that 
that was the same conclusion he 
had reached when a boy dashed 
past almost knocking them 
down. 

"Hey, what's the rush?" Rawlins shouted. "What goes on 
here?" 

The boy turned impatiently. 
"There's another invasion on. We 
want to see what this bunch has 
got." He ran on down the street. 

For the first time Simpson 
hesitated as if uncertain how to 
proceed. 

"We'll go see Queen Hortense 
first. Find out what the situation 
is there." He strode rapidly on 
ahead. 

A score of men in gray uniforms with rifles under their arms 
were lounging in the center of 
the square. They stiffened to attention as Simpson and the others 
entered. One of them detached 
himself from the group. 

"Just a minute there," he 
called. "Not so fast if you don't 
mind." 

Simpson paused at the entrance 
of the palace. There was anger as 
well as bewilderment in his eyes. 
"They're from Earth all right. 
Now what are they doing here? 
And who do they think they are?" 

Rawlins caught his arm. "That 
guy in front looks kind of 
familiar to me. By god, if I don ! t 



54 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



think it is. It's Ballard Kingsley 
— or else his twin brother." 

"You're right." Rawlins could 
feel Simpson trembling under his 
hand 1 . "The devil! The dirty 
double-crossing devil! That mesr 

sa gf— " 

"Take it easy," Rawlins cautioned. "They're armed and we 
haven't so much as a jack-knife 
between us. Better try to stall 
them for awhile." 

But Simpson thrust him impatiently aside. With clenched 
fists he hurled himself on the 
man in gray. 

"Back! " Rawlins shouted. 
"Simpson, back." 

Simpson had reached the leader and was clawing at his throat. 

"Oh, lord," Rawlins breathed, 
"here we go again." 

Along with the others he 
lushed to the aid of his chief. 

IX 

THE setting sun bathed the 
square in a flood of amber 
light. The people stood like 
statues, with one arm raised in 
salute to the splendor that wassinking into the underworld. 
From their throats rose the song 
of the Festival of Fire, telling of 
dimly remembered sorrows in 
ages past, sad with that sweet 
sadness that lies halfway between 
pleasure and pain. Now it struck 
a deeper note as Queen Hor


tense, followed by her maidens, 
ascended the steps to the altat. 

"The moon!" Linda cried. "I 
just saw it between the clouds. 
The little new moon." 

Rawlins glimpsed a star riding clear and serene above a 
bank of cloud. He watched it for 
a moment then turned back: to 
the throng below. Queen Hortense tall and stately in her ceremonial robes stood before the 
altar waiting to receive the torch 
whose breath was like the touch 
of life. 

"There it goes," he said, as 
the torch flashed through the 
air. 

A great roar rose from the 
throng as the flames leaped up. 
The people laughed and shouted as joyously as children on a 
holiday. 

"Well, it's the same old 
routine," Rawlins observed. 
"Everything just like the last 
time, far as I can see." 

"Only we're different," Linda 
said, brushing the hair- from her 
face. Her eyes were dull except 
when they caught the gleam 
from the fire. 

Rawlins drew her over beside 
him. Watching the Venusians a 
great sense of peace descended 
upon him. A sense of peace mingled with a faint nostalgia for 
all that had gone before. 

"Why, honey, what's the matter? Now don't feel bad again." 



SIMPSON 



55 



He tried to turn her face 
ound but she kept it stubbornaverted. 

"I feel so lost," she sobbed. 
'd been with Simpson so long 
can't get used to being wkht him any more." 
Rawlins patted her shoulder 
assuringly. 

"What do you suppose will 
come of us now?" she asked. 
"Well, we can take our 
choice. We can stay here and 
■keep on working or take the next 
ship back to Earth. Kingsley has 
given us three days to make up 
our mind." 

"I'd never work for Kingsley. That cold-blooded murderer." 

"Now, we've gone over all 
that before. I've explained to 
you it was bound to come sooner 
or later. Simpson had been the 
top man on Earth so long we'd 
got to take him as a matter of 
course. As soon as he pulled out 
the inevitable occurred. Kingsley went to work, wangled his 
men into key positions, and then 
struck. Curious thing was that 
Simpson never suspected anything. Old boy had gotten careless, I guess." 

Now the color had faded from 
the sunset sky leaving it a flat 
uniform gray. Only a faint patch 
of red glowed over the three volcanoes on the horizon. 

"Certainly Simpson secured a 



greater domination over more 
people's minds than any man before him," Rawlins mused, 
thinking out loud to himself. 
"But then, he had more advantages than those before him. 
Through newspapers and magazines and motion pictures and 
television he could multiply his 
thought a millionfold. And the 
people liked to have him do their 
thinking for them. He made life 
seem so simple and reasonable 
that they believed all the time 
they were figuring things out for 
themselves. And a man is never 
so happy as when he knows exactly what he should think and 
has a lot of people who agree 
with him." 

"You never did like him," 
Linda protested bitterly. "Why 
was Simpson so bad? What did 
he ever do to you?" 

"From certain remarks of 
yours I gathered you didn't altogether approve of Simpson 
yourself." 

"I know," Linda said, looking away. "But honestly, I did 
like him in lots of ways. It was 
just once in awhile when I got 
tired and discouraged." 

Rawlins drew Linda's head 
down against his- shoulder. 

"Mention the word superman 
and immediately we picture a 
brilliant genius with a bulging 
chest and the glance of Jove. But 
people don't appreciate a guy 



56 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



like that. They can't understand 
him and so they distrust him instinctively. It never occurred to 
any of us that the superman who 
could most easily dominate us 
would be an ordinary little fellow whose only claim to distinction would be in his uncanny 
ability to glorify our own commonplace ideas. In that sense I 
think Simpson was a genius — a 
superman. He was a master of 
mediocrity." 

"Just the same I think- he did 
a lot of good." 

"Well, I'm not saying he 
didn't. A man could get along 
first-rate in Simpson's world as 
long as he conformed to the 
crowd. But there was no room 
for the fellow who was born 
with six fingers. For the man 
who couldn't conform. It was a 
system that worked beautifully 
for people like us on the Earth. 
But it was doomed to failure on 
Venus, where the people aren't 
like us at all." 

"But they seem like us." 

"I know. That was where we 
got fooled. Simpson was so busy 
trying to control the people by 
turning out lipstick and coldcream and other gadgets to 
please them that he never got 
around to probing very deep beneath the surface. But from 
samples that went back to Earth 
Ballard Kingsley got suspicious 
immediately. He found that 



everything wasn't what it appeared on the surface. Now you 
can bet he'll never try to woo 
the Venusians as Simpson did. 
It was as hopeless as trying 
to domesticate the Argentina 
ant." 

"But I still don't understand 
why the Venusians are so different from ourselves," Linda 
declared. 

"Remember there are a lot of 
things we have never understood 
about Venus," Rawlins told her. 
"We've never been able to understand why a planet so similar 
to the Earth in so many ways 
should apparently have developed along such different lines. 
Astronomers have always had a 
hard time trying to make Venus 
fit into a theory of evolution 
along with the other terrestrial 
planets. Now Kingsley' s work 
makes it clear for the first time. 
Although it should have been 
plain enough if we'd had our 
eyes half way open." 

Linda laughed. "Mine must 
have been closed up tight I 
guess." 

"Did it ever occur to you as 
odd that nobody in our outfit 
ever fell for any of the Venusian women?" Rawlins asked. 

"It did strike me as rather 
odd," Linda confessed. "I couldn't help wondering sometimes 
what was the matter with the 
men. Some of the Venusian 



SIMPSON 



57 



women were quite good looking, 
too. 

"Well, suppose we put the 
question the other way around. 
Did you ever feel attracted toward any of the Venusian men?" 

"Good heavens, no!" 

"You see- — something was 
wrong," Rawlins told her. "The 
good old urge was lacking. Now 
' you take Queen Hortense . . . 
she's far and away the best looking woman I ever saw — " 

He checked himself abruptly. 
"Oh, well, why deny it? You 
know the queen's a gorgeous 
looker if there ever was one. Yet 
for some reason I never could 
go for her. She never had the 
slightest sex appeal for me." 

Linda was looking very hard 
at the crowd below. "There 
were times when I wasn't so 
sure." 

"Well, naturally I couldn't 
help staring at her. But honestly, honey, that was as far as it 
ever went. So far as I was concerned she might as well have 
been a statue or a beautifully cut 
jewel. 

"Now Stracker says it isn't so 
peculiar after all. It's all just a 
matter of a few neutrons apparently. Chemically we're the same 
as the Venusians but physically 
we're different. For instance, if 
you were to analyze the carbon 
in us and the carbon in a Venusian you'd find they're not the 



same. The carbon in our bodies 
is 99 per cent C 12 and only 1 
per cent C 13 . But in a Venusian 
about a third of the carbon is the 
rare C 13 variety. 

"You mean the Venusians are 
sort of stand-ins for us?" Linda 
said. "Isotope people?" 

"Something like that. At any 
rate, the abundance of the isotopes on Venus and the Earth is 
entirely different. Carbon isn't 
the only element that's abnormal. 
There's nitrogen and oxygen and 
titanium, too. And hydrogen! 
You've no idea how much deuterium there is around this 
planet. 

"That was what knocked me 
out at the first Festival of Fire. 
I got too big a dose of heavy 
water. It killed Jim and Betsy, 
too. Stracker thought it was 
arsenic at first. Naturally he 
never thought of heavy water." 

"If we'd only known," Linda 
said. "Everything might have 
been so different. Simpson 
might still be alive. Still in 
power." 

Rawlins shook his head. 

"I doubt it. Not for long at 
least. Remember the remains of 
that spaceship we found by 
the temple? Undoubtedly the 
Venusians have been invaded 
many times before. Their planet 
is a rich prize that others could 
hardly have overlooked in the 
past. But the Venusians know, 



58 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



in some subtle way that they 
probably don't understand themselves, that they are different 
from the other creatures of the 
solar system and that, given 
sufficient time, they will always 
emerge victorious." 

"But why?" Linda cried. 
"Why do they have these strange 
atoms in their bodies?" 

"It is a peculiar thing that regardless or where we turn our 
telescopes on the universe we 
find the same elements in almost 
exactly the same proportions. 
But notice that I said 'almost.' 
For here and there we find stars 
of the kind astronomers call 
Type R in which the abundance 
of the carbon isotopes is entirely 
different from that of the stars 



around them. Stars in which the 
abundance of C 13 is as high as 
it is on Venus. 

"Perhaps a billion or two 
years ago such a star came 
whirling past us and left a part 
of itself to become a stepchild 
of the sun's. Later this planet 
came to be known as Venus. And 
so the people who developed on 
Venus were always destined to 
remain strangers to the others. 
People alien and isolated. And 
nobody will ever be able to understand them, no matter how 
hard they try." 

Linda crept closer within the 
sheltering protection of Rawlins' 
arms. 

They were together, yet so 
very much alone, too.

npELL left the phone booth, 
-L having carefully folded the 
list of names and inserted it into 
the inner pocket of his overcoat. 
He adjusted the tall-crowned 
black fedora on his head as his 
eyes flicked over the noisy interior of the brilliantly lit drug 
store. He had been in the city 
eight days, among the peculiar 
people, and he had heretofore 



prided himself on his powers of 
adjustment. Most of the people 
he passed on the sidewalks or in 
bus aisles gave him blank, dullwitted stares, their minds turned 
inward. A few, however, would 
glance perceptively as they 
passed, noticing Tell's all too 
prominent cheekbones. He made 
it a habit to keep his lids lowered so that they could not see

his eyes. The ones who noticed, 
they had to be watched for, Tell 
knew, since their brains were 
constantly alive and alert. 

However, after the completion of the migration, he would 
have nothing to fear from 
them. t 

The drugstore, he saw, contained no Thinkers. A row of 
girls hunched over their coffee 
cups. Tell glanced at the clock 
over the door, his mind requiring a second to make the adjustment to a foreign numeral 
scheme. The noon hour. Resolutely then Tell left the drug 
store and proceeded along the 
abysmally dirty sidewalk toward 
the green sign marking a bus 
stop. The skyscrapers, as they 
were called, blotted out the sky 
and seemed to act as generators 
of filth. Tell longed for his 
home, sunny, wind-swept, on a 
sparkling red plateau. Then he 
recalled sadly that neither he nor 
any one else of his race would 
enjoy the comforts of that home 
after the migration. The Law 
had ordained a migration after 
each period of three — no — four 
thousand years as these creatures 
reckoned time. Well, they would 
mold this planet to fit their 
tastes, too. 

Tell stood by the bus stop, 
noting a comrade passing on the 
opposite side of the street, chin 
Sunk deeply into the collar of an 



overcoat similar to Tell's. Snow 
began to drift down again, wet, 
gray and unfriendly. Tell pulled 
his hat low as the bus snuffled 
toward him through traffic. It 
was comforting for Tell to think 
of the hundreds and hundreds 
of his companions laboring in 
this particular city exactly as he 
labored. Tell laughed silently as 
he recalled numerous incidents 
bearing out the theories of his 
Instructor, years ago before 
Tell had been ready to undertake his mission. The Instructor had pointed out that 
Tell and his companions would 
be forced to be better citizens of 
this world than those nativeborn, since the most important 
task of this special corps of millions, aside from their primary 
function, would be to avoid 
breaking any of the laws of these 
people. Mild-mannered and unassuming, Tell and his companions would hardly ever be 
bothered unless one of them committed some sort of offense. As 
far as Tell knew, no offense had 
yet been committed anywhere in 
the world by his companions. 
The inhabitants themselves violated all laws, including the 
smallest like the instructions of 
the colored lights at street crossings, so long as they were not. 
apprehended. If that happened, 
Tell expected that it would only 
be a short time before they re

sumed similar activities once 
more. 

Tell boarded the bus, calmly 
bearing the vituperations of a 
fat woman who insisted he had 
shoved in ahead of her. Snow 
fell harder now, renewing the 
supply that had only begun to 
vanish from the sidewalks and 
gutters. The bus careened forward through traffic. Tell stood, 
hand in strap, listening carefully 
to the driver as he called out the 
stops. At last Tell moved to the 
exit when the announcement 
came, "Soames Avenue." Soames 
Avenue. The name at the top of 
Tell's list. 

Tell felt relieved that no one 
else alighted from the bus at 
Soames Avenue. He stared up 
the street, wet snowflakes brushing against his cheeks with a 
foreign feel. Far in the distance 
he could see the end of the street, 
blocked by railroad tracks. He 
sighed softly and drew the list 
from his coat. The first home on 
his left, numbered on his list to 
correspond with the street numerals, was large and old-fashioned, pointed roof thrusting at 
the dull winter sky. Tell marched 
up the long flight of cement steps 
and rang the bell. He studied 
the list a moment longer, then 
thrust it deep into his coat again 
as he drew out a small notebook. 

A figure appeared behind the 
frosted glass door. Tell drew his 



hat on more tightly, reminding 
himself an instant later that the 
gesture was dangerous and uncalled for. The door opened to 
reveal a thin, seedy man of forty, 
with limp brown hair pasted 
over his forehead. He peered at 
Tell through steel-rimmed spectacles. Smoke curled up through 
a stub of a cigarette held in yellowed fingers. The man wore a 
faded red bathrobe. 

"Yes?" the man said suspiciously. 

y Tell said in perfectly articulated tones, "You are Mr. Amos 
Humphrey?" 
"That's right." 

"My name is Rogers, sir. I am 
conducting a survey for United 
Advertising Enterprises." Tell 
mentioned a city several hundreds of miles away as the place 
where the office was located. "I 
have credentials from the Chamber of Commerce and the Better 
Business Bureau giving me permission to canvass homes, sir, 
and I wondered if you'd mind 
letting me ask you a few questions. Each individual opinion is 
highly valued." 

Tell presented the carefully 
forged credentials, aware of the 
man's pleased smile after the last 
flattering sentence. "Why sure, 
come on in." The man held the 
door wide. Tell thanked him 
politely and stepped into the 
house. First of all he noted the 



m

large television set, the layers of 
sheet music on the piano and a 
number of glaze-covered movie 
magazines on a blond coffee 
table. The table looked expensive, but out of place among the 
other, ancient dark-wooded 
pieces ranged about the room. 
Tell leaned over and leafed 
through the magazines. "Do you 
read these regularly, sir?" 

"I don't," Humphrey said. 
"My wife and daughter do. I 
look 'em over once in awhile." 
The man chuckled self-consciously, "I kind of like to see 
what the stars are doing, you 
know." The chuckle continued 
for a moment. 

"I understand perfectly, sir," 
Tell replied. "May I ask your 
occupation?" 

"Plumber," Humphrey replied. "Though I ain't been 
working much lately. The flu's 
got me down a little." 

Tell scribbled meaningless 
phrases in his notebook, careful 
that Humphrey could not see 
him. "Now I'd like to ask you 
some questions, sir. Please give 
me a frank answer. This data 
will be kept confidential, but it's 
vitally necessary that we have it. 
Ready?" 

"Sure," Humphrey said with 
a slack grin. He eased himself 
into a chair as Tell did the same. 

"If an advertised product was 
offered to you," Tell asked, "and 



you knew nothing of the product's value, only that the word 
'science' was used in the advertising as a claim to its worth, 
would you tend to regard the 
product as worth buying? Yes or 
no?" 

Humphrey licked his lips. 
"Could you let me have that 
again?" 

Tell repeated the question. 
"You understand what I mean," 
Tell added. "If the advertising 
said, Science has proved it . . ." 
He lifted one hand in a gesture. 
"And so on." 

"Why," Humphrey said slowly, "I guess I'd buy it if scientists said it was okay." 

"Fine. Now let me ask you 
this. Which product would you 
buy, provided both were identical, only advertised under different names? One which displayed a picture of a girl in a 
sweater next to the product or 
one which did not?" 

"That's easy," Humphrey 
smirked obscenely. "The one in 
the sweater. Provided she was 
stacked." 

Tell asked a number of other 
questions pertaining to sex, religion and politics, at the end of 
which time he thanked Amos 
Humphrey and left the house. 
Humphrey had told him that his 
wife and daughter were out. Tell 
regretted that, since he liked to 
question each person individ


ually, but when time or circumstances did - not permit, one 
family member had to be taken 
as an index to the rest. The 
snow had abated somewhat, and 
Tell drew out his list. Carefully 
beside the name and address of 
Amos Humphrey he inscribed 
the word, Non-thinker. 

He proceeded to the next 
house, then crossed the street, 
asking his questions, working his 
way toward the railroad tracks 
as the afternoon progressed. He 
was appalled to find that every 
person on his list thus far had 
been a Non-thinker. Certainly 
the Instructors had prepared him 
for much greater opposition. Tell 
stood on the street corner two 
blocks from the railroad tracks 
'studying the next group of 
names on his list. Jack Bennet, 
Rhea Bennet, Timmy Bennet. 
Tell studied their house, another 
old and large structure veiled in 
gathering darkness. 

Tell first felt the sharp sting 
of something biting his cheek. 
Then he whirled to stare down 
the cross street at the little boy 
in red stocking cap, blue jeans 
and jacket who had heaved the 
snowball. The boy thumbed his 
pse derisively and screeched, 
'Yaaoahl" He ran in the oppose direction. Tell bent down to 
examine the snowball which had 
fallen apart at his feet. In the 
center was a sharply pointed 



EY 63 

stone. Tell felt wild panic as a 
drop of his yellow blood fell to 
the snow and shone colorfully 
for a moment. He pressed a hand 
to his cheek. How large was the 
wound? He needed something to 
cover it, or else he would be in 
grave danger. He wanted to return to the cubby hole in the 
rooming house where he made 
his temporary- home, but he knew 
he had to keep on with the survey. Today was his last day, and 
all data had to be in by midnight. Every inch of this city, as 
well as all other cities, had to be 
covered. What to do? 

Tell tore his handkerchief 
from his pocket and pressed it 
to the wound. He crossed the 
street quickly and walked up the 
front steps of the Bennet home, 
keeping the handkerchief tight 
to his cheek. He would have to 
be careful, very careful. But he 
calmed himself, realizing that in 
that way he could best carry out 
his double objective. He twisted 
the old-fashioned bell, heard it 
ring in the far distances of the 
house. A woman opened the 
door a few moments later, a slim 
attractive young red-head, wearing a house dress that could not 
conceal her figure, and a floursmudged plastic apron. Her 
greenish eyes studied him with 
concern. 

"Pardon me, madam," Tell 
burst out, "but I'm here making 



64 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



a survey. A young boy hit me 
with a snowball, there was a 
rock in it, and I'm afraid my 
face is cut badly. Could you — ?" 

"Come in, come in," the 
young woman said warmly. Tell 
stepped into the tastefully decorated front hall. "My name's 
Rhea Bennet. Come out to the 
kitchen and I'll fix that cut for 
you." 

"No, please," Tell said hastily. "I mean, I can fix it for myself. No need for you to bother. 
If you'd only show me the bathroom ..." 

"All right," Rhea Bennet replied pleasantly. "You say you're 
making a survey?" 

"That's right," Tell replied, 
pressing the handkerchief fiercely against his face. He was hardly aware of what he was saying 
as he thought of yellow blood 
seeping inexorably, dangerously 
through the cloth. But at last 
Rhea Bennet gestured him into 
a blue-tiled room and he closed 
the door behind him. With a 
gasp of relief he took the handkerchief away. The blood had 
not soaked through. In the 
medicine cabinet he found gauze 
and adhesive tape. He affixed a 
large patch to his cheek, taping 
it in place and studied his image 
carefully. No, it looked all right 
now. His anger at the small boy 
burned high for a moment, and 
he found himself wishing ex


termination upon the imp. Then 
he calmed himself as he realized 
that if all citizens of this planet 
had such childish instincts his 
job would not be necessary. 

He found Rhea Bennet in the 
kitchen. "Sit down," she said 
warmly, indicating the cheery 
kitchen table. "I've fixed you 
some coffee. This is terrible 
weather to be tramping around. 
Am I going to be surveyed?" She 
set down a cup of steaming coffee. The odor revolted Tell but 
he felt gratitude nevertheless. 
He took a sip of the coffee and 
sighed, smacking his lips in a 
perfect imitation of enjoyment. 

"Yes, you're going to be surveyed," he said. "You've no idea 
how much I appreciate your 
helping me like this." 

"It was nothing," she replied, 
returning to a pot bubbling on 
the stove. 

"Believe me, it was!" Tell declared fervently, thinking of the 
dangers involved, had he not 
checked the wound's flow. 

"I'm sorry my husband isn't 
home," Rhea Bennet said over 
her shoulder. "He'd love to be 
surveyed. They make him mad, 
advertising polls and the like." 

"Oh?" Tell replied with soft 
surprise. "What does your husband do?" 

"He's a plumber," Rhea Bennet replied. "My boy Timmy's

visiting his grandmother this 
afternoon." 

"A . . . plumber," Tell said 
with a vague feeling of emptiness. 'He wished suddenly he 
could leave this house and this 
-woman. He decided he had better get to the business of his 
survey immediately. He asked 
his first question. 

Rhea Bennet whirled, laughing. "Jack would love this. He'd 
stamp up and down and puff out 
his cheeks and swear like anything." She gave an imitation of 
Jack Bennet in anger that made 
Tell laugh with genuine humor. 
"One of Jack's pet complaints is 
advertising, and the way science 
is almost synonymous with God. 
Ho, I'm afraid Jack wouldn't 
buy anything just because some 
young brat with a toothpaste 
smile and a Windsor knot showed 
a couple of graphs or charts and 
mumbled something about scientific laboratories. Jack'd throw a 
brick at the television dr the 
radio, more than likely." 

"Well," Tell said, licking his 
lips. "That's very interesting." 
He licked his lips, staring helplessly at the scribbled note-book 
page. He put his second question to her. 

"Jack hates the female breast 
on a billboard almost as much 
as he does the way they use science." Rhea Bennet smiled at 
him. "No, I'm afraid we're not 



exactly the ad man's best prospect." 

"I can see that," Tell said 
softly, almost to himself. He felt 
discouraged, but he ran through 
the rest of the questions. To each 
one Rhea Bennet answered forcefully, in terms of what her husband thought, but it was only 
too clear to Tell that she agreed 
with him. When he had finished 
his questioning he retreated 
hastily to the front door. He fumbled awkwardly with his notebook, aware of the glance of the 
big-chested Jack Bennet from 
the picture frame on the mantel. 
Jack Bennet had a hard jaw and 
an uncompromising eye. 

Tell thanked Mrs. Bennet 
again as she opened the door for 
him. "I talked to another plumber this afternoon," Tell blurted 
out suddenly. "He . . . had some 
quite different ideas." 

Rhea Bennet frowned. "Amos 
Humphrey? Down by the boulevard?" Tell nodded. "He's a bad 
plumber," Rhea Bennet said 
with determination, "and what's 
more, he's a narrow-minded, 
hypocritical man." 

"Is that your . . . private opinion?" Tell said hopefully. 

"Private and public. Jack's 
told him to his face." 

"Oh. Well. Thank you." Tell 
stared disconsolately at his notebook as he walked off the porch 
into the snow that swirled with 



66 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



fresh vigor. The door closed behind him. He called himself 
seven kinds of fool for allowing 
personal sympathy to enter in, 
and yet the woman had been 
kind to him, gracious and generous. With regret he drew out 
his list. He hesitated a moment, 
and then with some bitterness 
he wrote Thinker beside the. 
name of Jack Bennet. Turning 
his face toward the railroad 
tracks, he trudged on through 
the snow gloom, having no taste 
for his task now but aware that 
it had to be finished. 

Two. more hours brought the 
completion of his survey. He replaced the list in his overcoat and 
walked slowly up to the boulevard. There he boarded a bus 
that carried him into the downtown district of the city. He was 
tired and lonely, and his feet felt 
leaden on the wet pavement. He 
walked 1 along until he found a 
deserted drag store with a row 
of phone booths far in the back. 
Pulling his hat low he entered 
the store and made straight for 
the furthest booth. There he 
closed the door, peering out beyond a magazine rack to see the 
nearest person, a clerk, leaning 
idly on a counter some fifteen 
yards away. Tell was glad to be 
' finished with the job. What he 
had had to do at the Bennets' 
was en&ugh to sour a person 
completely. That was the pitiable 



part, that thoughtfulness and 
consideration often came to- ~ 
gether ... Still, he realized that 
he, one unit in the great migration, was helpless. 

Wearily he reached into his 
trousers for a dime. He lifted 
the receiver, casting a wary eye 
to see that the clerk had not 
moved. He dropped the dime in 
the coin slot and when he heard 
the tone, he dialed eighteen 
times. In a moment he was in 
whispered communication with 
the central control ship, three 
hundred miles in the sky. 

The conquest of the planet 
called Earth was accomplished in 
three days. On the first day, the 
invaders announced themselves. 
On the second day they destroyed the six highest mountain 
peaks in the world as a demonstration of their power. On the 
third day the great gray ships 
began to land, bringing the exterminator corps. It had been 
made quite clear in the first announcement that The Law of the 
invaders made migration mandatory, and laid down also the 
terms of occupation. An Earthman prone to resist had no 
chance. The invaders, pleasanteyed, benevolent in' attitude and 
quite calm, were everywhere, 
millions of them, billions and 
hundreds of billions. But they

utilization of the planet to facilitate handling their large population, as well as plans for utilizing the satellite of, the Earth. 
x heir technology, it became pitifully apparent to Earthmen, was 
advanced some thousand or two 
thousand years beyond that of 
the invaded planet. 

Tell and his companion agents 
had greeted the first ships when 
they landed all over the globe. 
Tell had been systematically 
weeding out the Thinkers from 
the area he had canvassed. Exterminator trucks crawled like 
gray beetles over every strip of 
negotiable highway in the world. 
Tell had been working for two 
days and nights, fretfully, because the worst task lay at the 
end. Tell, riding beside his asistant who drove, saw Soames 
Avenue swing around before 
him as the truck pulled up before the armed guard posted at 
the street's entrance. The guard 
"made the sign of respect as Tell 
leaned out the window. 

"Jack Bennet, Rhea Bennet, 
Timmy Bennet, Thinkers," the 
guard recited from a clip board. 
"They are under guard." Tell 
returned the sign of respect and 
gestured his assistant on. 

"I'm not satisfied," Tell complained. 

"Tell," the assistant who was 
young, recently indoctrinated 
and enthusiastic, complained, 



"you know perfectly well that 
The Law forces us to migrate, 
and forces us to subjugate the 
colonized peoples by exterminating those clever enough to give 
us opposition. We want things 
to be peaceful. Only if we have 
slaves can we have peace. You 
know it's best in the long run. 
Surely you can't have the interest of these Earthmen above that 
of your own people." 

"No," Tell sighed, "that's the 
sad part of it, I know something 
is amiss, but I am a man of my 
people, and I would not presume 
to contradict The Law. Perhaps 
I would be happier if I were a 
slave too." 

"Nonsense," the assistant replied. He braked the truck before the Bennet household. An 
armed guard reported that the 
three members of the family 
were inside. Tell felt relieved. 
He could not face them. The 
assistant took charge when Tell 
waved to him. Tell sat slumped 
in the seat as the. side of the 
truck opened and the colorless 
rays radiated outward. The 
house disappeared abruptly, 
leaving the ground covered with 
a thin fragile coating of ash. 
Well, thought Tell,, we'll have 
no opposition from the Bennets. 
When we move on again, perhaps this world will develop 
Thinkers once more ... 

The assistant turned the truck 



68 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



around. As they neared the 
boulevard, Tell saw a man he 
recognized sitting dully on the 
curb, watching them drive past. 
Tell ordered the truck to a halt. 
Humphrey. Yes, Amos Humphrey. Savagely Tell thumbed- the 
control that opened the truck 
side. Humphrey disappeared, a 
dull uncomprehending glow in 
his eyes. The assistant seemed 
stupefied. "But ... but he was 
no . . . 

"Never mind, '" Tell snapped. 
"I am your superior. Forget 
this." 

"Yes, sir," the assistant replied submissively. 

"Drive on." Tell waved. He 
settled lower into the seat. Well, 
it was poor payment for the kind 
lady who had helped him. Poor 
and "completely inadequate. But 
he knew with his mind that he 
could do little else. The truck 
swung into the boulevard, and 
when they reached the downtown 
the street was jammed from curb 
to curb by a fleet of similar 
trucks. Over the incredibly dirty 
skyscrapers huge gray ships lowered. Tell would have to greet 
his wife and children soon. They 



would be coming to the city. He 
caught the assistant giving him 
a peculiar stare. "Pay attention 
to your driving," Tell snapped. 

I've lived too long on this 
planet without my fellows 
around me, Tell thought wildly. 
I've got to return to my own 
thought system. Even as he 
thought, he knew it was no use. 
The experience on Soames Avenue had definitely altered his 
personality. He could never forget it. His people would not 
want him in his mental condition. It would be unfair to them. 
What can I do anyway? he 
thought wildly. They'll find out, 
the assistant will report me and 
they'll psycho-examine me and 
then I'll be finished. Tell stared 
helplessly out the truck window, 
«t the ranks of other trucks driving along beside in orderly rows. 
He felt cheated, unlucky, hopelessly trapped. 

"Don't get any ideas about reporting me for what I did," TeH 
burst out to the assistant 

The assistant said nothing. 

At the first opportunity, Tell 
thought frantically, I will have 
to kill myself. . . . 



WHO YOU CALLIN' 

A MONSTER? 



By TOM BEACH 




IT WAS, of course, love at 
first sight. 

There were, of course, problems. 

That in the case of Mike de 
Forrest the problems were caused 
by an assortment of monsters can 
also be regarded as a matter of 



course. Mike, after all, was the 
creator of Enormo. And 
Bnormo's job was vanquishing 
monsters. 

In this he was aided by a 
Police Captain named McMuck, 
who was always wrong, and by a 
fantastically beautiful fiancee

COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



named Dinah, who was always 
willing. Enormo, of course, was 
always several things at the same 
time: superbly muscled, of stunning intelligence, handsome beyond the wildest Dream of the 
most imaginative Maiden, and 
invulnerable — even to the charms 
of Dinah. 

However, in the process of 
proving these attributes to a 
wondering throng of comic-strip 
readers, Enormo used up a remarkably large quantity of villains. Regular as clockwork, he 
vanquished one villain in every 
six-week period. And the sixth 
week was just about up. 

It became incumbent upon 
Mike to invent a new villain, a 
villain more horrible than The 
Nose, The Eyes, The Mouth or 
The Faceless, which Enormo had 
already disposed of. And his 
imagination had gone dead. 

With a sigh he discarded his 
latest idea, The Bullet, a man 
with a bullet-shaped head, as 
being too similar to The Point, 
a character whose skull had been 
flat, and whose chin came to a 
point. He stared at a blank 
scratch- pad and sighed again. 

It was no soap. There had 
been times, before The Nose, 
when he had decided that he had 
used every possible variation — -_ 
but then The Nose had come 
into his head and given him an 
entirely new slant that had re


sulted in a steady stream of 
monsters. But this time it looked 
as if he were below the bottom 
of the barrel. He had lain awake 
all night trying to work himself 
into a good nightmare — The 
Point had come from a nightmare — and now he'd been at it 
in his workroom nearly all 
day. . . . 

A sudden weariness swept 
over him. He placed his dark 
head on the drawing-board, halfclosed his dark-blue eyes. 

Sleepily, he took his pencil 
and drew a rough figure of 
Enormo on the section of scratchsheet near his head. Good old 
Enormo. Those piercing eyes, 
that jutting chin, that shirt with 
the big E on it, those bulging 
red trousers ... he certainly 
knocked off his villains quickly, 
didn't he? But what sort of villain would he knock off next? 

Mike's long body relaxed, his 
breathing became more regular— 
and then, all at once, he had it. 
He snapped upright in his chair 
and began to beam broadly at 
himself, rolling the pencil in his 
fingers. 

He had always used characters 
with one eccentricity of contour 
or appearance. Why not make it 
a full house this time — jumble 
all the horrors together and ring 
in a character who redly looked 
like something? 

He turned his gaze more fully 



WHO YOU CALLIhT A MONSTER?

on the scratch-sheet and went to 
work. Head and ears first — the 
head completely hairless, like. The 
Egg, one of the first villains in the 
series — the ears wide and cauliflowered like a more recent monster, The Loving Cup. Then the 
eyes, nose and mouth, carefully 
picked from various horrors — and 
the body of The Big, the one 
character in the strip who had 
been even more enormous than 
Enormo, 

He sketched a few more lines 
here and there, giving the thing 
•not only life but personality, he 
hoped. Then he braced his hands 
on the edge of the drawing-board 
and lifted his head to take a good 
look. 

"Eep," said Mike de Forrest. 

He leaped from his chair and 
slammed against the wall. 

The last vestige of sleep was 
gone from his eyes. There was a 
mirror on the wall behind him, 
and he turned quickly and looked 
into it. He was a little surprised 
to find his dark hair still dark. 

"Eep," he said again. Then, 
more calmly, "Now, 'there is a 
monster." 

He had to fight the impulse, 
though, to turn and rush out the 
front door and down the stairs. 
Furtively, he approached the 
drawing-board. 

. This, he told himself, was 
screwy. He was Mike de Forrest 
[ — pne inch over six feet, one 



hundred and ninety pounds of 
lean muscle, as tough a bird as 
ever frightened a syndicate editor 
into giving a strip a bigger advertising campaign. This couldn't 
be happening: a tough bird like 
him afraid of one of his own 
characters. 

He set his jaw and looked 
down. The second view improved 
in no particular upon the first. 
He reached the mirror, however, 
with even greater speed. 

There was no doubt about it, 
he told his shaken reflection. He 
had created the prize monster of 
the century, and it scared the 
living daylights out of him. 

After staring into his own 
seared eyeballs, he decided that 
another attempt would be foolhardy. Shaking his head and 
muttering to himself, he left the 
room. "What a puss," he told 
himself on the way to the shower. 

His watch told him , it was 
twenty minutes after six, which 
gave him less than an hour to 
shower, shave and dress for 
dinner. This was Tuesday, "the 
evening he spent each week at 
the Graysons. 

That was a break. Bill Grayson, 
who had gone to college with 
him, had something to do with 
banks — which Mike always 
thought of as Vice-President In 
Charge Of Sad Depositors — and 
was the solid, sturdy, level-headed 
type, and his wife, Helen, was 



72 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



the same. Just the sort of people 
he needed tonight, he thought, 
feeling as shaky as he did. 

Pausing only to turn on all the 
lights in the house, he went 
quickly about his business, and 
presented himself at the Grayson 
household ten minutes early. 

As the door opened and Bill's 
round, grinning face peered out 
at him, he was pretty much the 
old Mike de Forrest again — the 
Mike de Forrest with the tough 
gleam in his eyes and the fit, 
jaunty swing to his wide shoulders. Bill's apartment was only 
half a mile from his own, and a 
brisk walk in the crisp, cool 
evening air had filled him full of 
the joy of life and quelled his 
startled memory of the monster 
on the scratch-sheet. 

And then, two minutes later, 
all thoughts of Enormo and his 
playmates were swept out of his 
head with a suddenness that took 
his breath away and sent an entirely different sort of shiver up 
his spine. 

If you were wondering what 
had happened to the love at first 
sight, wonder no longer. Her 
name was Dinah Stewart, and 
she was a guest of the Graysons'. 

Dinah, Mike learned in acrossthe-table conversation, was an old 
school friend of Helen's, and was 
staying with the Graysons while 
her father finished up some out


of-town business. Then he was 
going to join her here in New 
York, where they were to settle 
permanently. 

Her father, Dinah told Mike, 
was old-fashioned and a bit on 
the stiff-collar side, and had consented to allow her to precede 
him only because she had been 
invited to stay at the home of a 
friend, and because the friend's 
husband was a respectable professional man. 

"He felt I'd be safe here," she 
explained, her eyes shining at 
him. 

Mike gazed at her, awed, and 
nodded mutely. His one desire 
at the moment was to keep her 
safe. In hundreds of daydreams 
he had imagined a girl like Dinah 
— rhe'd even drawn her, ineptly, 
into his Enormo strip. Any drawing he did of her would have had 
to be inept; she was, he told 
himself stickily, beyond art. She 
couldn't exist. 

And yet, here she was— about 
five feet four (absolutely right), 
young body all slim loveliness 
(check), ^ honey-colored hair, 
long, faintly upcurved brown 
eyes, tip-tilted nose and sweet, 
scarlet mouth (his personal specifications, exactly). Love at first 
sight was quite a mild word for 
it, Mike mused. 

They went to a movie after 
dinner, the four of them, and he 
couldn't look away from her long 



WHO YOU CALLIN' A MONSTER? 



73 



enough to watch the picture. They 
took a taxi to the theater and 
walked back, and the demure 
grace with which she moved (as 
required, precisely) made it a 
struggle for him to keep from 
taking her into his arms there 
•and then. 

Before the evening ended, he 
had decided to take a vacation 
from work and spend every possible moment trying to make 
Dinah feel toward him as he had 
always, he realized, felt toward 
her. He was slightly ahead of 
schedule on the strip anyhow, 
and though the fear he had for 
his monster was certainly ridiculous, the prospect of a vacation 
from him, too, made the scheme 
doubly pleasant. 

He took Dinah for a tour of 
pie city the next day, courageously releasing her after only 
an instant when a subway train 
"threw her into his arms; then for 
a long walk along a rambling 
path in Central Park, holding her 
hand while they inhaled the 
delicately sharp scent of grass 
and trees; and finally, that evening, to a play — a tender and 
beautiful story of young love. 

And she was so desirable 
through it all that, as they 
paused outside the Graysons' 
apartment to say goodnight, Mike 
took a deep breath, tried to think 
of something else, took another 
deep breath, and lost all control. 



Gradually, he realized that two 
miracles were happening. He was 
kissing her; and she, magnificent 
and wonderful she, was kissing 
him. • 

For long minutes they clung 
together, precariously balanced on 
a staircase. Mike blinked his eyes 
and opened them and she was 
still there before him. Miracle, 
he thought, number three. 

Then he took gentle hold of 
her shoulders and stared into her 
eyes. 

Rose-color had crept into her 
face, near her high cheekbones, 
and she looked even lovelier than 
before. 

"Will you marry me, Dinah?" 
he asked. 

"Yes, Mike," she said softly. 
"Whenever you say. ..." 

And then, all at once, she 
gasped, the rose-color fled, and 
she looked away. 

"What's the matter?" Mike 
asked anxiously. 

She shook her head. "My 
father," she sighed. 

"Well, what about your 
father?" 

Her eyes stared off into space. 
"He's been so good to me I— I 
just couldn't marry without his 
permission. No matter how silly 
it sounds. And he'll never permit 
the marriage, Mike. He'll never 
let me marry you." 4 

Mike stared. "What's the 
matter with me?" he asked. 



74 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



"Your father doesn't even know 
me!" 

"I told him — you draw — 
Enormo. He thinks it's a horrible 
thing. He thinks it undermines 
children. Mike, he hates you already." 

"Hates . . ." 

"Mike, he called you a monster. A perverter of little tots. 
He said tots. A beast in human 
form. Then he got up from the 
dinner-table and went away. He 
locked his study door and 
wouldn't let me in." 

Slowly, Mike's wonderment 
faded, to be replaced by the 
tough look, the look which made 
syndicate editors hide under their 
desks and syndicate presidents 
use rear exits. "He'll unlock his 
door for me," he said. 

"Mike, you simply don't know 
my father. People like you are 
his specialty. I remember, we had 
a male secretary once,, and 
Father ..." 

"I don't even care to hear 
about it," Mike said. "I don't 
care how tough an old egg he is 
— if he stands in the way of this 
marriage I'll bring him down to 
soft-boiled status quicker than 
you can say Enormo. Dinah, my 
dear, you underestimate me. I'll 
just give him some brisk talk 
and the de Forrest eye, and before you know it he'll be whimpering and rubbing his cheek 
against my trouser-leg." 



Dinah sighed. "All right, 
Mike. But don't forget I warned 
you." 

Then she moved toward him. 
There passed an hour without 
conversation. 

The remainder of the week 
was, as Mike kept telling himself in a wondering fashion, 
heaven. He saw Dinah for 
eighteen hours each day, spent 
half of the remaining six talking 
to her on the phone, and devoted 
the other three to dreaming about 
her. And in every hour that 
passed a new beauty appeared 
to his awed eyes. 

He was, briefly, on top of the 
world, and spinning as dizzily as 
the North Pole. Life, he confided 
to the Graysons' Scotch terrier, 
was indubitably braw and bricht, 
not to mention licht. 

He was young, in perfect 
health, and possessed of enough 
money to support a huge family 
through several lifetimes. He was 
in a business he enjoyed and 
as soon as he overcame an idiotic 
psychological quirk — he had a 
new villain for Enormo. And, of 
course, there was Dinah, not 
lightly to be shrugged off. 

The elder Stewart he discounted completely. Obviously, a man 
who viewed Enormo as a perversion had a stone for a heart, and 
could hardly feel any affection 
for Dinah. And a man without 



WHO YOU CAlLIN' A MONSTER? 



75 



affection for Dinah, he felt, was 
a man disarmed. 
Small wonder, then, that he 
sang as he walked through the 
streets, attracting rude stares and, 
once, a surprising twelve cents 
that had plunked into his hat as 
ike waved it wildly in his hand. 

The following Monday, on a 
gray, cold and rainy morning, 
•Sidney B. Stewart arrived in New 
York. 

f The face that peered out from 
pie half-opened Grayson door 
was wearing a wild, haunted 
look which Mike dismissed as 
■merely silly. The hand that shook 
his was grave and unnaturally 
'■ hot. Bill's usual stolid happiness 
■had deteriorated completely. 
Mike thought it curious, but dismissed it from his mind airily. 
J Dinah was waiting for him in 
|fhe long foyer. She kissed him 
|f everishly, and he got the odd impression that it was the . kind of 
kiss a girl gave a dearly beloved 
about to depart on a long journey. 

"He's in the living-room," she 
said. "He's — expecting you. 
Good luck." She kissed him 
tgain. 

"Never fear," Mike tossed 
over his shoulder. 

He stepped into , the livingroom and felt behind him for 
support almost at once. Leaning 
weakly against a satisfying tough 
'all, he watched Sidney B. 
tewart rise from an easy chair 



to glare at him. Sidney B. Stewart 
rose . . . and rose . . . and rose. 

He was bigger than Enormo, 
bigger than The Big. But mere 
bulk alone had never stopped 
Mike. It was the hairless head, 
the large, cauliflowered ears,, the 
unutterably horrible eyes, nose 
and mouth that curdled Mike's 
blood and sent it swishing around 
in his shoes. 

Sidney B. Stewart might just 
have stepped -off the sketch-pad 
in Mike's workroom. He was the 
most horrible monster in the 
world, and he scared the living 
daylights out of Mike de Forrest. 

Dimly, Mike heard a voice. 
"Father," Dinah said, "I want 
you to meet Michael de Forrest. 
Mike, this is my father." 

"Delighted," Mike bleated, advancing a shrinking hand toward 
the mass of hairy flesh attached 
to Sidney B. Stewart's right 
sleeve. 

"Urm," said Sidney B. Stewart, 
enclosing the hand with his own 
and squashing it politely.' 

He looked at Mike and Mike 
crept further into the wall. 

"You draw Enormo," he said. 

"I do." 

"It is a perversion. I dislike 
Enormo. You are teaching children to expect a world in which 
the hero always vanquishes the 
villain. It is not a true picture 
of the world in which we live." 

"I—" 



76 COSMOS SCI 

"Yes, yes. Doubtless all that 
is so. The fact remains that you 
ate distorting the minds of small, 
defenseless children. It should be 
legally punishable. I shall be extremely happy if you do not visit 
my daughter again. I shall be — " 
a hand reached out and clamped 
Mike's shoulder suddenly— "extremely unhappy if you should 
continue in your attentions." 

Mike squirmed loose from the 
gripping hand and moved farther 
along the wall. "I love Dinah 
and you're not going to stop me," 
he said, but it sounded a trifle 
weak. 

"Indeed," the monstrous creature said. Abruptly, he turned his 
huge back on Mike and his 
terrifying gaze on Dinah. "I shall 
want a word with you later," 
he said. "Meanwhile, please excuse me. I should like to wash 
my hands." 

He began to walk toward the 
door. 

For a moment Mike watched 
him, stunned and shaken. Then, 
overcome by the spectacle of his 
collapsing dreams, he gave a low 
cry and leaped forward, plucking 
at the man's arm. 

Sidney B. Stewart turned. 

"Well?" he said. 

Mike coughed. 

"... marry your daughter," he 
said faintly. 

A slow smile spread over Sidney B. Stewart's considerable 



vICE FICTION 

face. His eyes, which did not join 
in the smile, grew smaller, and 
the eyebrows over them formed 
a straight line. 

"Surely," he began, and stopped. "Surely you did not say you 
wanted to marry my daughter?" 
He coughed. 

Mike nodded. "Your daughter. Dinah. You know Dinah. 
Lovely girl." 

"Young man," Stewart said. 
There was an eager, almost a 
pleading note in his voice. "Turn 
and look at the door for a moment." 

Mike turned. He looked at the 
door. It was, all things considered, a fairly nice door. But before he could admire it properly 
—before he could note its fine 
carving and expert paint- job — 
something huge and firm caught 
him in the seat of the pants and 
shot him down the hall. He hit 
the floor and rolled over twice 
before he stopped against the far 
wall. „ 

The door shut. He was compelled to view it from the other 
side. But he did not look at it 
now. Slowly, he rose. He put his 
ear to the door, straining to hear 
every word of Dinah's fine rage, 
her terrible anger. For a second 
he wondered how she could stand 
up to that monster. But then, 
she'd grown up with it; she was 
probably hereditarily immune. 

There was only silence. He 



WHO YOU CALLIN' A MONSTER? 



77 



could not deceive himself; Sidney B. Stewart had cowed them 
both. Dinah was afraid to speak. 

He began to open the door. 
The intelligent thing to do was to 
take another crack at it, after all; 
but his hand did not touch the 
doorknob. Though it sickened 
and revolted him to admit it, he 
did not have the courage to face 
Sidney B. Stewart again that 
night. 

He tilted back and forth for a 
moment while Thoughts of Nuptial Bliss struggled to overcome 
Stark Fear. It was no use. 

Shoulders sagging, he turned 
and crawled out of the apartment. 

The passage of time had healed his wounds a little when, some 
minutes later, he entered his own 
apartment, but even that minutely 
happier feeling did not last. He 
had dragged Dinah into whileyou-wait photo studios at every 
opportunity during the past week, 
and had accumulated a veritable 
wallpapering of pictures of her. 
It seemed now, to his feverish 
eyes, that each one looked accusing and bitterly disappointed. 

Blindly, he fled into his workroom, viewing the bare walls 
with relief. He slumped into a 
chair in front of his drawingboard. Then, quickly, he leaped 
up again. The face of Sidney B. 
Stewart leered up at him frighteningly. 



Standing a few feet away, he 
told himself the whole thing was 
silly. ' 

The resemblance was all in 
his mind. There was no real 
similarity. 

He forced himself back for a 
closer look. The monster, on close 
examination, looked even more 
like The Monster. 

On a sudden impulse he ran 
into his hall, plucked a picture of 
Dinah from the wall, and searched for a back strip of Enormo. 
He put both exhibits close together. 

Dinah — and Dinah. They 
were identical. 

He thought about it. Dinah: 
Dinah. Stewart: the monster. 

Where, he asked himself, is 
Enormo? 

But the answer to that one was 
easy. After all, he'd never been 
drawn into a sequence with the 
monster. 

Neither had Dinah — but then, 
Dinah had always been in his 
thoughts and that might account 
for something. , 

" Not that it made any difference. 
Feverishly, he grabbed a pencil 
and began to draw. 

Enormo — wearing the clothing, appearance, and mental 
makeup of Michael de Forrest — 
entered the Grayson residence 
boldly. Bill tried to grin; the effort was pathetic. Enormo said, 



78 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



invincibly, "I am looking for Mr. 
Sidney B. Stewart." 

"Sure," Bill said. "He's in the 
study, resting. The effort of kicking you out seems to have 
taken something out of the poor 
man." 

"I see," Enormo said. "And 
Dinah?" 

"She's in there with him. He 
wanted to talk to her." 

"Good." Without further 
comment, Enormo strode to the 
study door and pulled it open. 
Sidney B. Stewart looked up in 
surprise. 

"I thought I told—" he started, and then smiled horribly. 
x, Ah. Mr. de Forrest has returned." 

"He has," Enormo stated. 
"He wishes a word with you. 
Dinah, stay here." 

"Mike!" she said. 

"This will all be cleared up in 
a moment. Mr. Stewart — " 

"Yes?" 

"You have refused to allow 
me to marry your daughter. Allow me to contradict your wishes. 
I intend to marry your daughter 
at once. You will give us permission, this very instant." He 
stared into the eyes of the monster. 

"I re—" Sidney B. Stewart 
began, but the effort was too 
much for him. Under the glare 
of those invincible steely eyes, 
he broke. 



"I agree." The words were a 
whisper. 

"Mike!" Dinah said, and was 
in Enormo 's arms. 

Gently he disengaged her. "I 
can never love you," he said. "I 
am committed to a greater cause 
— the cause of Right. Right 
shall triumph." He strode out of 
the room. Dinah's sobbing followed him. 

"Damn it," Mike said to his 
reflection, "I forgot Enormo was 
impervious to women." 

A lot of good it does you to 
curse now, he told himself. The 
time to think is before the act is 
done. Now you've ruined yourself for good with the girl. 
You've gone and walked right 
out of her young life. 

"I didn't," Mike said. 
"Enormo did." 

And, he thought, a fat lot of 
difference that makes. You're 
stopped cold, and you might as 
well admit it. 

"I'm not." 

Oh, yes you are. 

"But . . ." 

Mike began to pace the floor, 
steadily. His mind was whirling 
dizzily. Obviously, drawing 
Enormo into his problems didn't 
work. Enormo was all right for 
villains and bullets and things, 
but when it came to women he 
was an extremely total loss. 

But if the situation had come

out of the strip, if he'd actually 
created Dinah and her father- in 
| some blinding flash of artwork 
i — or something; he hadn't yet 
; -figured out just how it had been 
I done — then the solution had to 
come from the strip too. And 
there had to be a solution. His 
young life was not, he insisted, 
going to be blighted by a mere 
slip of the pen. 
I He sat and stared at the draw: ing of the monster. "It started 
with- you," he told it, "and it 
, has to end with you." The monster did not reply. 

Then, suddenly, as once be. fore, he had it. The solution 
stared him in the face. Quickly 
he erased a few lines of his drawing, added others. He built up 
the hair on the monster's head, 
gave him a kindly expression, 
lopped off the ears and replaced 
them with small, shell-like creations. It took a little over an 
hour. 

"Your own mother," he told 
the kindly, understanding man 
who looked up at him, "wouldn't recognize you." 

Then he went off to discuss, 
in a gentlemanly fashion, the 
problem of his marriage. He was 



quite sure >her father would be 
reasonable. 

"But what," Dinah asked 
later, "are you going to do 
for a villain for the next six 
weeks?" 

He shrugged. "Let's not 
bother about it," he said, reaching for her. "I'm glad your 
father happened to be home." 

"I've never seen him so 
pleased with anybody. He really 
likes you," Dinah said. "He's 
sweet." 

Mike said, "I'm giving up 
Enormo. Advertising work — 
there's the field. Drawing those 
cigarettes, food, drinks — why, a 
man can support himself with 
ease." 

"Models," Dinah reproved 
him. 

"What?" 

"Those models you'll have to 
draw." 

"A mere nothing," he said. 
"You'll be all the model I'll 
ever need, believe me." 

"I'm glad," she said. There 
was silence for, a long time. 

The minister looked exactly 
like Police Captain McMuck. 



Night On 

Horseback 

By WINSTON K. MARKS 




WHAT a dream! 
I was on a place called 
Earth, a fantastically beautiful 
sphere of moderate temperatures, 
liquid waters, spacious continents 
and a glorious, exhilarating atmosphere abounding in intoxicating oxygen. 

80 



It was good to be alive! I 
sucked the sweet stuff into my 
broad chest and urged my white 
charger down the shady country 
lane. Before I had gone far I 
came to a swift , stream with a 
narrow, gravelly shallows for a 
horse to ford without swimming. 



NIGHT ON HORSEBACK 



81 



As my stallion stepped into 
the swirling current a snorting, 
black horse galloped' up from 
the far side. His rider, a great 
bloated pig of a man, larger even 
than I, reined up and roared, 
"Out of my way, varied " 

He rushed me. Coolly I dropped the point of my lance and 
moved in. We collided in midstream, lance to shield, fair blows 
both, and the lances splintered. 

My broadsword leaped tp my 
mailed fist, and with a single 
smite I sent his quaking lard 
squalling into the deep, muddy 
pool. 

Only then did I see the trembling, white-veiled female who 
had ridden in attendance to my 
boorish opponent. The nostrils 
of her longish nose flared like 
those of the nervous mount she 
rode side-saddle. Her lovely, flat 
bosom heaved with a quick, 
mysterious emotion, and before I 
could address her she wheeled 
her mount and disappeared down 
the path. I drew slowly across 
the ford, and a still pool near 
the shore threw back my reflection as I stared pensively into it. 
My handsomely rugged face was 
flushed, for the timid damsel's 
abrupt motion on her horse had 
swung her riding skirt in an immodest arc. I could not avoid 
seeing her dainty feet, her thick 
ankle and fat calf up to where it 



vanished into a delightfully 
knobby knee. 

With the scent of a gentler adventure and a heavy perfume in 
my aquiline nostrils I stirred my 
charger and rode forth in pursuit. 

At length I came upon a great 
city and found myself embroiled 
in considerable and noisy 
vehicular traffic in the narrow 
canyons between cliff-like structures of stone and glass. The 
assorted conveyances seemed to 
be given their lethargic motion 
by a combination of expelled exhaust gases and audible sound 
vibrations which burst forth intermittently in strident braying 
cacophony. 

I spied my lady fair trying to 
cross the intersection of two 
canyons. Her costume was 
changed to a trim, white linen 
suit with a perky basket of fruit 
perched on, her lovely salt-andpepper hair. As I reined to make 
a left turn in her quest, a bluecloth-coated minion grabbed 
milady and gesticulated obscenely. It appeared she had violated 
the sacerdotal bidding of the 
corner totem post which winked 
balefully with green and red 
eyes, or so the minion screamed 
in a bull's voice. He was a great 
bloated pig of a man. Larger 
even than I, and certainly the 
twin of my adversary at the ford. 

Unarmed except for some 



82 COSMOS SC 

ridiculous - little sideweapon 
which he withdrew from a 
leathern pouch at his belt, upon 
my approach, he presented no 
worthy resistance. So I merely 
slapped the object from his hand, 
spun him and whacked him 
sturdily on the backside with my 
sword. Having seemed to recognize me, he gave terrified 
tongue and ran madly into the 
path of an oncoming huge vehicle 
whose iron wheels dealt with 
him more severely, perhaps, than 
he truly deserved. 

In the confusion my gentle, 
feminine quarry slipped into the 
maw of a mammoth structure, an 
edifice whose height was so great 
I could not tilt my head enough 
to view its crown. With a flap 
of . my snaffle-rein I clattered 
through the clutter of squatty, 
covered carts, heedlessly raking 
fenders and turret- tops with my 
charger's poitrel. 

With a jolly jangle I dismounted, and as I dropped the 
snaffle insecurely around the 
peculiar tieing post at the roadside, a bevy of insignificant 
females of various luscious proportions gathered about and accosted me by such titles as 
Tyrone, Gary, Montgomery, 
Clark and the outlandish like. 
Vermilion lips pursed and uttered soft, low whistles of insinuating impurity. No vestal 
virgins, these.

Into the arched entrance I 
strode, too late discovering that 
a portal of sorts, transparent but 
palpable, barred my way. The 
shards of it cascaded from my 
breast-plate and pauldrons, but 
since I was helmet-less, a crystal 
fragment sliced an interesting 
'wound beneath my blue left eye. 

I came upon my beloved waiting before yet another portal 
and staring anxiously at a 
bronzed pointer above, the gate. 
The pointer moved mysteriously 
on a pivot and held the attention 
of several persons. As I approached her, a gray-suited hulk 
brushed past me and confronted 
her first. 

He was a great bloated pig of 
a man, larger even than I. 

He grasped her wrist cruelly 
and made her kneel to the marble 
floor. His lips twisted into a 
bestial snarl. "Late again, returning from lunch, eh? Do you 
think I pay you to dwaddle over 
your ^sauerkraut and potato 
salad?" he demanded. "I run an 
office, not an old maid's club, 
Miss Crebbes. Take a letter, 
damn you, Miss Crebbes. Take a 
letter. Take a letter." 

For a moment I stood shocked-. 
Then, withdrawing my gauntlet, 
I clapped the boor on the side 
of his bristly haircut. "Sirrah," 
I addressed him, "you abuse this 
dream-maiden! You vilify her by 
your tongue insults. You con

taminate her with your loathsome 
touch. Have at you, sir!" 

As the swine faced me his face 
blanched, and my own skin 
tightened with chagrin. Was the 
man indestructible, or was this 
the triplet of my two recently 
vanquished foes? 

A wicked rapier of impossible 
design. flashed into his ham of a 
fist from some devilish source, 
and he belaboured me soundly 
up and down the vaulted chamber 
before I deftly severed his sword 
hand an inch above the . wrist. 
Then I stripped the floppy garments from his gross body and 
bludgeoned every area of him 
with the broadside of my weapon 
until he collapsed vilely into a 
pool of his own filthy blood. 

My squatty maiden fair croaked, "Arthur!" and swooned 
heavily into my arms, which 
were, forsooth, already tired. 
Amid the cheers of a hundred 
straining voices I swept her out 
to my charger, and we galloped 
to the suburbs apace. 

Instinctively I turned in 



through the white picket gate 
of a neat fence surrounding a. 
quaint little stone cottage. Fragrant, roses bordered the flagstones and arbored the entrance. 
Inside she slipped into something 
more comfortable, while I shed 
my armour and mixed a drink. 

She came to me, my virgin 
love, resplendent in a filmy garment so transparent that it barely 
concealed her girdle. By mutual, 
silent consent we drifted to the 
sofa, an overstuffed piece with 
nary a protruding horsehair, and 
as I crushed her to my leathern 
jerkin her freckled eyelids lifted. 
She stared deeply into my eyes. 
A rare ecstasy and veritable 
miasma of perfume enveloped 
us, driven only by her gasping 
sighs. 

"I dream, Arthur, my love," 
she whispered, "so pinch me, but 
gently lest I should awaken. I 
would not awaken." 

But I pinched her hard, nonetheless.. 

And she did, of course, 
awaken.

"T7"ES, that's the Bishop," said 
J- the Second Mate impatiently. Half consciously he counted 
the seconds between flashes, 
satisfied himself that they tallied 
with the period given in the 
Light List. "We're up to the 
Scillies on time. All going well; 
weather permitting, we should 
be fast alongside in Glasgow tomorrow night." 

"What do you mean?" asked 

84 



Canning. "Weather permitting? 
Surely it will stay fine." 

The attitude of earnest enquirer sat well upon both him 
and his wife, as it so often does 
upon dowdy, middle aged 
couples. All the way from Sydney 
they had shown an intense interest in maritime affairs, an avid 
curiosity that soon caused most 
of the ship's officers to avoid 
them. It was the Second Mate 



SHADOW BEFORE 



85 



who had discovered their 
Achilles' Heel, the weak joint in 
their armour. They were spiritualists. Mrs. Canning was a medium of some repute. And they 
lent a receptive ear to all the 
stories that he had to tell them. 
Tall tales all, retailed at third 
or fourth hand, losing nothing 
in the retelling. 

"Fog," explained Weldon 
briefly. "The glass is too high, 
and there's no wind. Even with 
radar you don't want to go 
charging up the Irish Sea and 
seeing nothing. If there were no 
traffic it'd be different. ... But 
this house in Dublin, now . . . 

"They were very grateful for 
the lift, these two girls, and they 
asked him in for a drink. But 
he. was late already, and knew 
that his wife would be worrying. 
But they had their way, and he 
got Out of the car and went in 
with them. The house was nicely 
furnished and well kept, and in 
a small sitting room the three of 
them sat down and dipped their 
beaks into a glass of port — or 
sherry, I forget which. And they 
had one cigarette each, which he 
supplied from his case. . . ." 

The Fifth Officer, enjoying his 
evening constitutional and after 
dinner cigarette with his current 
girl friend, passed, muttered 
. audibly: "It all ghost to 
show. ..." Weldon shot him a 
dirty look and continued. 



"Just one cigarette, and one 
glass of wine. And then he said 
that he really must go, and so 
he said goodnight, and let himself out, got in his car and drove 
home. Next morning, dressing, 
he missed his case. He was 
somewhat miffed about it, as it 
was a present from his wife. He 
thought back, remembered where 
he had left it. The house wasn't 
in a part of Dublin where any 
of his own patients lived, but 
he thought that he could find it. 

"He did find it. It was deserted 
—shutters up, garden a mess of 
weeds. Nevertheless, he was determined to get his case back, 
and hammered on the door. Nobody answered, of course, but 
eventually the woman next door 
— the place was semi-detachedpoked her head over the fence 
and said that there wasn't anyone in, that there hadn't been 
anyone in for three years, and 
that the two ladies who did live 
there had up and vanished. . . . 

"But he was quite convinced 
that it was the right house, and 
at last forced an entry through 
the "kitchen window. The inside 
was as bad a mess as the outside — dust everywhere. He found 
the little room where they had had 
their wine. He found the table 
with the decanter and the three 
empty glasses— all with a good 
half inch of dust on 'em. And 
he found his fag case.

"I don't think it was ghosts. 
It was, it must have been, some 
kind of Kink in Time. . . . That 
would account for the two 
women waiting at the bus stop 
at an hem when all buses had 
long ceased running." 

"You materialists," replied 
Mrs. Canning in a pitying voice. 
"You won't face up to the facts 
about the Other World. You 
. invent marvellous explanations 
that are far more fantastic than 
anything that we say or claim. 
It was apparitions of the dead 
he saw. ..." 

'.'Maybe so. But what about 
the house? Everything in order 
and well kept. , . ." 

~ "In a case like that, Mr. 
Weldon, he would see the house 
through the eyes of the apparitions. They wanted him to find 
something there " 

"He found his case." 

" something that would 

throw light upon their mysterious 
disappearance. Ah, if only I had 
something, anything, from that 
room!" 

"Psychometry, Flora?" asked 
Canning. Then, to Weldon, "She 
says she isn't very good at it, 
but I'ye seen some amazing results. 

"Really, George," protested 
Mrs. Canning insincerely, "I'm 
not very good." 

"Psychometry?" asked Wei


ENCE FICTION 

don. "Is that what they call spirit 
writing?" 

No — although Flora is very 
good at that too. Psychometry is 
done with objects, or letters, or 
photographs. She takes them in 
her hand, tells me about them 
and their . . . associations." 

"But this spirit writing. . . . 
Do you think that you could do 
some here?" 

"Surely this ship isn't haunted, 
Mr. Weldon?" 

The Second Officer did not 
smile — one knowing him would 
have said that he looked more 
than a little serious. He hesitated 
before making his reply. Then— 
"I don't know. I wish I did 
know. There's been something 
funny about her this trip. Just 
little things— but too many of 
'em. As though somebody with 
unlimited ingenuity, but very 
little strength, was trying to 
throw our time table out of gear. 
It has been like a ship I was in 
during the war— she was determined not to catch a certain 
westbound convoy from Milford 
Haven. Everything went wrong 
-—but they delayed the sailing of 
the convoy so we could make it. 
Then we developed boiler 
trouble and had to put into Liverpool. The convoy we finally 
caught enjoyed a quiet crossing to 
the States. And so did the one 
we should have caught— but with 
our original schedule unchanged 



SHADOW BEFORE 



87 



we might well have been somewhere in time to catch some real 
trouble. ..." 

"Well, this trip in this ship, 
the steering gear went haywire — 
and they don't know to this day 
just how or why it did — justas we were passing under Sydney 
Bridge. But the pilot used our 
twin screws intelligently and we 
didn't hit anything. Then there 
was a fire started in Number 2 — 
but it was discovered before it 
got going properly. There has 
been an epidemic of small things 
— Liverpool Man goings on. You 
don't know that phrase, do you? 
If you come up to the chartroom 
and find that somebody has 
spilled the ink over the chart, 
and nobody will own up to it — 
that's the Liverpool Man's doing. ... 

"Perhaps I've been more than 
usually sensitive this trip. We 
have a child coming, our first, 
and with luck I should be home 
just in time to welcome him into 
this little world. But all the 
luck seems to be the wrong 
kind. ..." 

Canning was unimpressed. 
Weldon's story was so tame, so 
unspectacular, compared with the 
tall tales he had been telling 
them. But Mrs. Canning was 
eager. Her almost colorless eyes 
shone behind the spectacles, the 
plain, dull face had taken an 
unwonted vivacity. She put out 



her right arm, flexed her fingers. 

"I can feel . . ." she declared. 
"Mr. Weldon can come along 
to our cabin, George." 

" Traid I can't," replied the 
Second. "Company's Rules and 
all that. But we're allowed to 
entertain passengers in our accommodation — ' provided that 
everything is strictly decorous. 
Will you come up? We can have 
a drink to lay the dust of dinner." 

The Cannings accepted. They 
followed the officer up the ladder, 
along the boat deck to the 
officers' flat under the bridge. 
They seated themselves on Weldon's settee while he investigated the contents of the locker 
under his desk. 

"There's some brandy here," 
he told them, "not too bad. And 
there's some barely drinkable 
port. ..." 

"Could I have a port and 
lemon?" asked the medium. 

"Sorry, haven't any lemonade 
in stock. Would orange cordial 
and a splash of soda do?" 
"It would be lovely." 
Weldon mixed the drink, 
wondered how anybody could 
take such a. revolting mixture, 
poured a brandy each for himself 
and Canning. Flora Canning 
delicately sipped her sickly concoction and then, suddenly, 
stiffened. 

"There's a man here," she 



88 COSMOS SC 

said. "Standing by the door. I 
think he's something to do with 
wireless. I get an impression of 
valves and wires and . . . things. 
He's very unhappy. He seems 
to belong to this room — or to 
somebody in it. Did you have a 
friend, a wireless operator, who 
was killed in the war?" 

• Weldon politely wrinkled his 
brow, succeeded only in corrugating his expression of impolite" incredulity. 

f 'No," he said shortly. 
"I can see that you don't believe, Mr. Weldon. But it's a 
relation of yours, I'm sure. 
There's such a strong resemblance." 

Then she gave a little scream 
as a deep, mournful bellow shook 
the room. Canning dropped his 
glass. Even the officer, who had 
been half expecting it, started. 
He got to his feet, looked 
through the port "Fog," he said. 
"Thick as pea soup. Thank God 
for radar!" 

; "He's gone," lamented the 
medium. "It must have been that 
awful whistle. I don't think that 
I can do anything now." 

"Try," begged her husband. 
"Try, Flora. After all, this may 
be the last night of the voyage. 
And who knows what we may 
find out!" 

Weldon asked, "What do you 
need?" 

"A writing pad — a large one 



=NCE FICTION 

if you have it. A pencil — soft." 

"Can do. Here — you'd better 
sit at my desk, Mrs. Canning. 
I'll sit on the settee with Mr. 
Canning." 

There was a knock at the door. 

"Yes?" called Weldon. 

It was the stand-by quartermaster. 

"Can you come up to the 
bridge, sir?" he asked. "The 
echo sounder's not working." 

"Somebody's been tinkering 
with it. Oh, well — make yourselves at home. I shan't be long. 
There's fags in the box, and another drink or two in the 
bottles. . . ." 

When he had gone Mrs. Canning said, "Perhaps it will be 
better now. He doesn't believe. 
His vibrations are all wrong. But 
there's something here — and I 
mean to find out who or what it 
is." 

"What do you think, Flora?" 

"That's what we have to find 
out, dear. Pour 'me another 
drink, will you? And is this his 
pad? It's too small." 

"Try this." 

This was a cargo plan in Weidon's desk. Canning took it, 
turned it over so that the plain 
side was presented as a writing 
surface. His wife sat in Weldon's 
chair, held the pencil loosely in 
her right hand. Her eyes closed. 
Then — 

Hard . . . she wrote. Hard. 



SHADOW BEFORE 



89 



Struggle all time to get through. 
Adverse forces. Inertia. Give 
lever big enough and I move 
Earth— but only little levers and 
time short. ... 

"Who are you?" asked Canning. "What do you want?" But 
the scribbling pencil ignored 
his questions. 

Must stop it now before too 
late. My father killed this ship, 
collision in fog. Little damage, 
only one dead — my father. Went 
inspect place where hit, slipped 
wet planking, drowned. Hell him 
careful, careful. Make him believe. 

"What . . . ?" began Canning. 
Then— "When? When did all 
this happen? What can we do 
about it now?" 

The whistle sounded again, 
the prolonged blast making the 
very air of the room quiver. Mrs. 
Canning shivered, her jerkily 
scribbling hand slowed to a stop. 
Her eyelids nickered. She stirred 
uneasily in her chair, made a 
sound that was half sigh, half 
moan. 

Then she slumped. The pencil 
moved uncertainly, doodled. 
Canning, peering over his wife's 
shoulder, tried hard to read some 
significance into the formless 
scrawls. Then the pencil was off 
again in a barely legible race 
against time. 

Father dead, mother married 
again. Unhappy home. Turned 



out wrong, bad. Caused suffering, 
misery. And, at end, I was 
murderer. Perhaps this Hell, 
Purgatory. Don't know. But must 
try change course of events. 
Hard, too hard. Too much inertia.* Strong forces fighting all 
time. Tell him — and the pronoun 
was heavily underscored — careful. Send someone else. ..." 

"Who?" demanded Canning. 
"Who has to be careful?" 

My father. . . 

"But he's dead. You said 
so." 

.Not yet. When die Time all 
mixed up. Direction, not duration. Will be dead — but not yet. 
Must try save. Must. . 

And again the whistle bellowed. And again the medium 
stirred and shifted while the 
writing hand hesitated, slowed 
i — stopped. And this time she did 
awake. It was a sharp, staccato 
sound that did it — the quartermaster rapping on the door. 

"Mr. Weldon's compliments, 
sir, but he won't be down for a 
while. He's helping the Chief 
Radio Officer fix the radar. . . ," 

"It's gone!" cried the medium. 
"The power is gone!" 

"No, ma'am. I don't think it's 
that. I heard 'em say it was a 
valve burned out." 

"I didn't . . ." began Mrs: 
Canning. Her husband laid a 
quieting hand on her shoulder, 
squeezed hard. 



90 COSMOS SC 

'"Thank you, my man, "he sa i d 
stuffily. 

The quartermaster looked 
curiously at the odd couple in 
the Second Officer's room. He 
said nothing more— just raised 
his eyebrows and turned to go. 
As soon as he was out of si^ht 
Canning said, "Now, readmit. 
What do you make of it. Flora?" 
"Give me time." 
The woman picked up the 
reversed cargo plan, puckered 
her brows over what was scrawled on the paper. She demanded 
angrily, "What is this? George, 
did you . . . ?" 

"Of course not, darling. How 
could I?" 

"But this is utterly absurd. 
It must be somebody's idea of a 
joke — somebody who overheard 
Mr. Weldon's silly theories 
about Kinks in Time. Kinks in 
Time, indeed! A departed spirit 
comes from the past." 

"Of course, dear," put in the 
husband timidly, "there's Dunne. 
I know you never would read 
his 'Experiment With Time', 
but. . . ." 

"What sensible person would? 
Surely we can have clairvoyance 
and prophecy without dragging 
in all this rubbish about Fourth 
Dimensions! But I think I know. 
. . . You remember that guide I 
had a year or so ago — the one 
who said that he was an ancient 
Egyptian, the one I had to get 



:NCE FICTION 

rid of. Ancient Egyptian! He was 
such a liar he might -have been 
anything! This is the kind of 
thing that he'd do. It must be 
spite." ' 

She took the paper in her 
hand, made as if to screw it up. 

"Don't!" said Canning 
sharply. 

"And why not? Oh, there's 
all this stuff on the back of it. 
Though Mr. Weldon doesn't 
deserve to have it back — I hold 
him partly responsible for this 
exhibition of childish humor. 
There!" She ripped the plan 
viciously across. "And there! 
Kinks in Time, indeed!" 

The wastepaper basket received the dubious evidence of 
temporal twists and tangles. 

Canning looked worried. He 
picked up the brandy bottle refilled his glass. He took its contents neat. 

"All the same," he said slowly 
I think we should warn the 
Captain. According to this there's 
going to be a collision— and 
that's a serious matter even if 
nobody's killed. . . ." 

"Collision — fiddlesticks! Besides. ..." 

She left the sentence unfinished, but her husband was sufficiently telepathic to get her 
meaning. A worried shipmaster 
on the bridge of his ship in dense 
fog, would not welcome the sudden incursion of two spiritualists 



SHADOW BEFORE 



91 



bearing warnings of imminent 
disaster. This was rendered even 
more certain by the fact that the 
Captain and the Cannings were 
not on speaking terms, had not 
been since the day that they, in 
all innocence, had asked if they 
could hold a spiritualist service 
each Sunday. 

Canning had his faith — but he 
was not yet prepared to become 
a martyr to it. 

"Then let us go, my dear," 
he suggested." We will see Mr. 
Wei don in the morning." 

Not far from the Second 
Officer's cabin was a room of 
which only he possessed the key. 
From it came the low, steady 
music of electric motors, a continuous, quietly regular clicking. 
It was the Master Compass 
Room. In the middle of the 
deck stood the binnacle, and this, 
too, was always kept locked. Inside the binnacle was the heavy 
gyroscope, suspended in the 
midst of the intricacies — vertical 
ring, phantom ring, mercury ballistic, azimuth motor, follow up 
system — that made it a compass. 
The clicking noise came from the 
trolleys running back and forth 
over their contactor blocks as the 
compass "hunted." 

But a compass, however efficient, is not much good if it is 
not placed where the helmsman 
can steer by it. So, in addition to 



the Master, there are Repeaters 
— these being sited as and where 
required. 

To transmit the motions of the 
Master,- relative to the ship, to 
the Repeaters there is the transmitter. This is a little carriage, 
with a roller brush at the end of 
each of its arms, rotating inside 
a ring whose inner periphery is 
made up of copper segments — 
the contacts. As the roller brushes 
pass over these contacts so the 
repeaters click over — one third of 
a degree for each segment. 

In the bottom of the binnacle 
were two pieces pf paper. These 
were there for a purpose. They 
were what Weldon used daily 
to clean his trolleys and contactors — not to be confused with 
the transmitter carriage and contacts — by sliding the thin material 
between polished wheel and 
polished surface. 

The light was out in the 
Master Compass Room- — but, in 
any case, there was nobody, nobody corporeal, to see the two 
scraps of paper float and flutter 
up from the bottom of the binnacle, from under the gyroscope 
casing, drift unsteadily to the 
transmitter. There was nobody 
to see them sliding — slowly, 
hesitantly — between the carbon 
roller brushes and the copper 
contacts. 

The ship, not steering too well, 
yawed; her head fell off from 



92 COSMOS SC 

000 to 004. The carriage of the 
transmitter turned on its axis, 
following the relative movements 
of the master compass. But the 
repeaters on the bridge did not 
follow — paper can be a good 
insulator. And paper is light — 
very little energy is required to 
lift two pieces — each, say, two 
inches square. Less energy than 
is required to pull down a heavy 
switch — especially when that 
switch has to be pulled against 
all the inertia of the past. 

Then the makeshift insulators, 
their work done, fell ■ from their 
insecure position between brushes 
and contacts. There was no one 
to see them fall. Save for the 
pseudolife of the machines the 
Master Compass Room was 
empty. 

"That will do the whistle," 
said the Captain thankfully. 
Then— "Full Ahead both. Full 
Away!" 

■ In the radar shack Weldon, 
still helping the Chief Radio 
Officer, heard the welcome noise 
of the telegraphs, the double ring 
signifying that Stand By was 
ended. He opened the door and 
looked outside. "It's lifted, 
Paddy," he said. "It's a beautiful 
night. ..." His eye was caught 
and held by a bright, but fast 
diminishing, stern light abaft the 



NCE FICTION 

beam. "Hell! She, whoever she 
was, didn't miss us by much!" ^ 
"A miss is as good as a mile," 
replied Paddy philosophically. 
"Full speed again? Looks as 
though you might make it after 
all." 

"Hope so. Rather think I shall 
now.. Somehow, I'm sure that I 
shall. You know — I've been quite 
worried about it this trip— the 
first one and all that. And I've 
been wanting rather badly to 
be on hand to welcome young, 
Michael into this vale of tears, 
to say nothing of being able to 
lend moral support to Jane. And 
I had an absurd sort of — what 
was it we used to call it during 
the war?— premonition of impending doom. But it's gone 
now. It's like ... like some 
sort of shadow that's lifted with 
the fog. 

"Oh, well — you can manage 
without me now. Doesn't look 
as though we'll be needing the 
magic eye again. I'll tell the 
Third to get an azimuth to make 
sure that the gryro isn't playing 
silly beggars— then I'll turf 
those weird Cannings out of my 
room and get some sleep before 
midnight. ..." 

Fading fast astern the event, 
past in Space and Time, never 
now to come, no longer cast its 
shadow before. 



WHEN THE 
FIVE MOONS RISE 



By JACK VANCE 




SEGUILO could not have gone 
far; there was no place for 
him to go. Once Perrin had 
searched the lighthouse and the 
lonesome acre of rock, there 
were no other possibilities — only 
the sky and the ocean. 

Seguilo was neither inside the 
lighthouse nor was he outside. 



Perrin went out into the night, 
squinted up against the five 
moons. Seguilo was not to be 
seen on top the lighthouse. 

Seguilo had disappeared. 

Perrin looked indecisively 
over the flowing brine of 
Maurnilum Var. Had Seguilo 
slipped on the damp rock and 

93 



94 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



fallen into the sea, he certainly 
would have called out . . . The^ 
five moons blinked, dazzled, 
glinted along the surface; Seguilo might even now be floating 
unseen a hundred yards , distant. 

Perrin shouted across the dark 
water: "Seguilo!" 

He turned, once more looked 
up the face of the lighthouse — 
seventy feet of welded steel. 
Around the horizon whirled the 
twin shafts of red and white 
light, guiding the barges crossing from South Continent to 
Spacetown, warning them off 
Isel Rock. 

Perrin walked quickly toward 
the lighthouse. Seguilo was no 
doubt asleep in his bunk or in 
the bathroom. 

Perrin went to the top chamber, circled the lumenifer, 
climbed down the stairs. "Seguilo!" 

No answer. The lighthouse returned a metallic vibrating echo. 

Seguilo was not in his room, 
in the bathroom, in the commissary, or in the storeroom. Where 
else eould a man go? 

Perrin looked out the door. 
The five moons cast confusing 
shadows. He saw a gray blot: 
"Seguilo!" He ran outside. 
"Where have you been?" 

Seguilo straightened to his 
full height, a thin man with a 
wise doleful face. He turned his 



head; the wind blew his words 
past Perrin's ears. 

Sudden enlightenment came 
to Perrin. "You must have been 
under the generator!" The only 
place he could have been. 

Seguilo had come closer. 
"Yes ... I was under the j generator." He paused uncertainly 
by the door, stood looking up at 
the moons, which this evening 
had risen all bunched together. 
Puzzlement creased Perrin's forehead. Why should Seguilo crawl 
under the generator? "Are you 
—well?" ' 

"Yes. Perfectly well." 

Perrin stepped closer and in 
the light of the five moons, 
Ista, Bista, Liad, Miad and 
Poidel, scrutinized Seguilo sharply. His eyes were dull and noncommittal; he seemed to carry 
himself stiffly. "Have you hurt 
yourself? Come over to the steps 
and sit down," 

"Very well." Seguilo ambled 
across the rock, sat down on the 
steps. 

"You're certain you're all 
right?" 
"Certain." 

After a moment Perrin said, 
"Just before you — went under 
the generator, you were about to 
tell me something you said was 
important." 

Seguilo nodded slowly. 
"That's true." 

"What was it?" 



WHEN THE FIVE 

Seguilo stared dumbly up into 
the sky. There was nothing to 
be heard but the wash of the 
sea, hissing , and rushing where 
the rock shelved under. 

"Well?", asked Perrin finally. 
Seguilo hesitated. 

"You said that when five 
moons rose together in the sky, 
it was not wise to believe anything." 

"Ah," nodded Seguilo, "so I 
did." 

"What did you mean?" 

"I'm not sure." 

"Why is not believing anything important?" . 

"I don't know." 

Perrin rose abruptly to his 
feet. Seguilo normally was crisp, 
dryly emphatic. "Are you sure 
you're all right?" 

"Right as rain." 

That was more like Seguilo. 
"Maybe a drink of whiskey 
would fix you up." 

"Sounds like a good idea." _ 

Perrin knew where Seguilo 
kept his private store. "You sit 
here, I'll get you a shot." 

"Yes, 111 sit here." 

Perrin hurried inside the lighthouse, clambered the two flights 
of stairs to the commissary. 
Seguilo might remain seated or 
he might not; something in his 
posture, in the rapt gaze out to 
sea, suggested that he might not. 
Perrin found the bottle and the 
glass, ran back down the steps. 



MOONS RISE 95 

Somehow he knew that Seguilo 
would be gone. 

Seguilo was gone. He was not 
on the steps, nowhere on the 
windy acre of Isel Rock. It was 
impossible that he had passed 
Perrin on the stairs. He might 
have slipped into the engine 
room and crawled under the 
generator once more. 

Perrin flung open the door, 
switched on the lights, stooped, 
peered under the housing. Nothing. 

A greasy film of dust; uniform, unmarred, indicated that 
no one had ever been there. 

Where was Seguilo? 

Fighting the sudden rush of 
panic, Perrin went up" to the 
topmost 'part of the lighthouse, 
carefully searched every nook and 
cranny down to the outside entrance. No Seguilo. 

Perrin walked out on the rock. 
Bare and empty; no Seguilo. 

Seguilo was gone. The dark 
water of Maurnilam Var sighed 
and flowed across the shelf. 

Perrin opened his mouth to 
shout across the moon-dazzled 
swells, but somehow it did not 
seem right to shout. He went 
back to the lighthouse, seated 
himself before the radio transceiver. 

Uncertainly he touched the 
dials; the instrument had been 
Seguilo' s responsibility. Seguilo 
had built it himself, from parts

struments 

Perrin tentatively flipped a 
switch. The screen sputtered into 
light, the speaker hummed and 
buzzed. Perrin made hasty adjustments. The screen streaked 
with darts of blue light, a 
spatter of quick red blots. Fuzzy, 
dim, a face looked forth from 
the screen. Perrin recognized a 
junior clerk in the Commission 
office at Spacetown. He spoke 
mgently. "This is Harold Perrin, 
at Isel Rock Lighthouse; send out 
a relief ship. ... Do you hear? 
There's been an accident; send 
out a relief ship." 

The face in the screen looked 
at him as through thick pebble 
glass. A faint voice, overlaid by 
sputtering and crackling, said, 
"Adjust your tuning. . . I can't 
hear you. . . ." 

Perrin raised his voice. "Can 
you hear me now?" 

The face in the screen wavered 
and faded. 

Perrin yelled, "This is Isel 
Rock Lighthouse! Send out a relief ship! Do you hear? There's 
been an accident!" 

" — signals not coming in. 
Make out a report, send — " the 
voice sputtered away. 

Cursing furiously, under his 
breath, Perrin twisted knobs, 
flipped switches. He pounded the 
set with his fist. The screen 
flashed bright orange, went dead. 



anguished five minutes, to no 
avail. No light, no sound. 

Perrin slowly rose to his feet. 
Through the window he 
glimpsed the five moons racing 
for the west. "When the five 
moons rise together," Seguilo 
had said, "it's not wise to believe 
anything." Seguilo was gone. He 
had been gone once before and 
come back; maybe he would 
come back again. Perrin grimaced, shuddered. It would be 
best now if Seguilo stayed away. 
He ran down to the outer door, 
barred and bolted it. Hard on 
Seguilo, if he came wandering 

back Perrin leaned a moment 

with his back to the door, listening. Then he went to the generator room, looked under the 
generator. Nothing. He shut the 
door, climbed the steps. 

Nothing in the commissary, 
the storeroom, the bathroom, the 
bedrooms. No one in the lightroom. No one on the roof. 

No one in -the- lighthouse but 
Perrin. 

He returned to the commissary, brewed a pot of coffee, 
sat half an hour listening to the 
sigh of water across the shelf 
then went to his bunk. 

Passing Seguilo's room he 
looked in. The bunk was empty 

When at last he rose in the 
morning, his mouth was dry 
his muscles like bundles of 



WHEN THE Fl' 

withes, his eyes hot from long 
staring up at the ceiling. He 
rinsed his face with cold water 
and, going to the window, 
searched the horizon. A curtain 
of dingy overcast hung halfway 
up the east; blue-green Magda 
shone through like an ancient 
coin covered with verdigris. 
Over the water oily skeins of 
blue-green light formed and 
joined and broke and melted. 
... put along the south horizon 
Perrin spied a pair of black 
hyphens — barges riding the 
Trade Current to Spacetown. 
After a few moments they disappeared into the overcast. 

Perrin threw the. master 
switch; above him came the 
fluttering hum of the lumenifer 
slowing and dimming. 

He descended the stairs, with 
stiff fingers unbolted the door, 
flung it wide. The wind blew 
past his , ears, smelling of 
Maurnilam Vat, The tide ' was 
low; Isel Rock rose out of the 
water like a saddler He walked 
gingerly to the water's edge. 
Blue-green Magda broke clear of 
the overcast; the light struck 
under the water. Leaning precariously over the shelf, Perrin 
looked down, past shadows and 
ledges and grottos, down into 
the gloom. . . . Movement of 
some kind: Perrin strained to see. 
His foot slipped, he almost fell. 
Perrin returned to the light

house, worked a disconsolate 
three hours at the transceiver, 
finally deciding that some vital 
component had been destroyed. 

He opened a lunch unit, pulled 
a chair to the window, sat gazing 
across the ocean. Eleven weeks 
to the relief ship. Isel Rock had 
been lonely enough with Seguilo. 

Blue-green Magda sank in the 
west. A sulfur overcast drifted 
up to meet it. Sunset brought a 
few minutes of sad glory to the 
sky: jade-colored stain, with 
violet streakings. Perrin started 
the twin shafts of red and white 
on their nocturnal sweep, went 
to stand by the window. 

.The tide was rising, the water 
surged over the shelf with a 
heavy sound. Up from the west 
floated a moon; Ista, Bista, Liad, 
Miad, or Poidel? A native would 
know at a glance. Up they came, 
one after the other, five balls 
blue as old ice. 

"It's not wise to believe. . . ." 
What had Seguilo meant? Perrin tried to think back. Seguilo 
had said, "It's not often, very 
rare, in fact, that the five moons 
bunch up — but when they do, 
then there's high tides." He had 
hesitated, glancing out at the 
shelf. "When the five moons 
rise, together," said Seguilo, "it's 
not wise to believe anything." 

Perrin had gazed at him with 
forehead creased in puzzlement. 
Seguilo was an old hand, who 



98 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



knew the fables and lore, which 
he brought forth from time to 
time. Perrin had never known 
quite what to expect from 
Seguilo; he had the trait indispensable to a lighthouse tender 
— taciturnity. The transceiver had 
been his hobby; in Perrin's ignorant hands, the instrument had 
destroyed itself. What the lighthouse needed, thought Perrin, 
was one of the new transceivers 
with self-contained power unit, 
master control, the new organic 
screen, soft and elastic, like a 
great eye. ... A sudden rain 
squall blanketed half the sky; 
the five moons hurtled toward 
the cloud-bank. The tide surged 
high over the shelf, almost over 
a blocky gray mass. Perrin eyed 
it with interest; what could it 
be? . . . About the size of a 
transceiver, about the same shape. 
Of course, it could not possibly 
be a transceiver; yet, what a 
wonderful thing if it were. . . , 
He squinted, strained his eyes. 
There, surely, that was the milkcolored screen; those black spots 
were dials. He sprang to his feet, 
ran down the stairs, out the door, 
across the rock. ... It was irrational; why should a transceiver 
appear just when he wanted it, 
as if in answer to his prayer? 
Of course it might be part of a 
cargo lost overboard. . . . 

Sure enough, the mechanism 
was bolted to a raft of manasco 



logs, and evidently had floated 
up the shelf on the high tide. 

Perrin, unable to credit his 
good fortune, crouched beside 
the gray case. Brand new, with 
red seals across the master switch. 

It. was too heavy to carry. 
Perrin tore off the seals, threw 
on the power: here was a set he 
understood. The screen glowed 
bright. 

Perrin dialled to the Commission band. The interior of 
an office appeared and facing out 
was, not the officious subordinate, 
but Superintendent Raymond 
Flint himself. Nothing could be 
better. 

"Superintendent," cried out 
Perrin, "this is Isel Rock Lighthouse, Harold Perrin speaking." 

"Oh, yes," said Superintendent 
Flint. "How are vou, Perrin? 
What's the trouble?" 

"My partner Andy Seguilo disappeared — vanished into nowhere; I'm. alone out here." 

Superintendent Flint looked 
shocked. "Disappeared? What 
happened? Did he fall into the 
ocean?" 

"I don't know. He just disappeared. It happened last 
night — " 

"You should have called in 
before," said Flint reprovingly. 
"I would have sent out a rescue 
copter to search for him." 

"I tried to call," Perrin explained, "but I couldn't get the 



WHEN THE FP 

regular transceiver to work. It 
burnt up on me. ... I thought 
I was marooned here." 

Superintendent Flint raised 
his eyebrows in mild curiosity. "Just what are you using 
now?" 

Perrin stammered, "It's a 
brand new instrument — floated 
up out of the sea. Probably was 
lost from a barge." 

Flint nodded, "Those bargemen are a careless lot — don't 
seem to understand what , good 
equipment costs. . . . Well, you 
sit tight. I'll order a" plane out in 
the morning with a relief crew. 
You'll be assigned to duty along 
the Floral Coast. How does that 
suit you?" 

"Very well, sir," said Perrin. 
"Very well indeed. I can't think 
of anything I'd like better. . . . 
Isel Rock is beginning to get 
on my nerves." 

"When the five moons rise, 
it's not wise to believe anything," 
said Superintendent Flint in a 
sepulchral voice. 

The screen went dead. 

Perrin lifted his hand, slowly 
turned off the power. A drop 
of rain fell in his face. He 
glanced skyward. The squall was 
almost on him. He tugged at the 
transceiver, although well aware 
that it was too heavy to move. 
In the store-room was a tarpaulin which would protect the 
transceiver until morning. The 



: MOONS RISE 99 

relief crew could help him move 
it inside. 

He ran back to the lighthouse, 
found the tarpaulin, hurried 
back outside. Where was the 
transceiver? . . . Ah — there. He 
ran^through the pelting drops, 
wrapped the tarpaulin around the 
box, lashed it into place, ran 
back to the lighthouse. He barred 
the door, and whistling,- opened 
a canned dinner unit. 

The rain spun and slashed at 
the lighthouse. The twin shafts 
of white and red swept wildly 
around the sky. Perrin climbed 
into his bunk, lay warm and 
drowsy. . . . Seguilo's disappearance was a terrible thing, 
it would leave a scar on his 
mind. But it was over and done 
with. Put it behind him; look to 
the future. The Floral Coast. . , , 

In the morning the sky was 
bare and clean. Maurnilam Var 
spread mirror-quiet as far as the 
eye could reach. Isel Rock, lay 
naked to the sunlight. Looking 
out the window, Perrin saw a 
rumpled heap — the tarpaulin, the 
lashings. The transceiver, the 
manasco raft had disappeared 
utterly. 

Perrin sat in the doorway. The 
sun climbed the sky. A dozen 
times he jumped to his feet, 
listening for the sound of engines. But no relief plane appeared. 

The sun reached the zenith,

verged westward. A barge drifted 
by, a mile from the rock. Perrin 
ran out on the shelf, shouting, 
waving his arms. 

The lank red bargemen 
sprawled on the cargo stared 
curiously, made no move. The 
barge dwindled into the east. 

Perrin returned to the doorstep, sat with his head in his 
hands. Chills and fever ran along 
his skin. There would be no relief plane. On Isel Rock he 
would remain, day in, day out, 
for eleven weeks. 

Listlessly he climbed the steps 
to the commissary. There was 
no lack of food, he would never 
starve. But could he bear, the 
solitude, the uncertainty? Seguilo 
going, coming, going. . . .The 
unsubstantial transceiver. . . . 
Who was responsible for these 
cruel jokes? The five moons rising together — was there some 
connection? 

He found an almanac, carried 
it to the table. At the top of 
each page five white circles on 
a black strip represented the 
moons. A week ago they strung 
out at random. Four days ago 
Liad, the slowest, and Poidel, 
the fastest, were thirty degrees 
apart, with Ista, Bista and M ad 
between. Two nights ago the 
peripheries almost touched. U* 

m front 



of hta, tomorrow night 



Liad lagged behind Bista. . . . 
But between the five moons and 
Seguilo's disappearance — where 
was the connection? 

Gloomily Perrin ate his dinner. Magda settled into Maurnilam Var without display, a dull 
dusk settled over Isel Rock, water 
rose and sighed across the shelf. 

Perrin turned on the light, 
barred the door. There would be 
no more hoping, no more wishing — no more believing. In 
eleven weeks the relief ship 
would convey him back to Spacetown; in the meantime he must 
make the best of the situation. 

Through the window he saw 
the blue glow in the east; watched Poidel, Ista, Bista, Liad and 
Miad climb the sky. The tide 
came with the moons. Maurnilam 
Var was still calm and each moon 
laid a separate path of reflection 
along the water. 

Perrin looked up Into the sky, 
around the horizon. A beautiful 
lonesome sight. With Seguilo he 
sometimes had felt lonely but 
never isolation such as this.

up the staircase. "Hello, anybody 
home?" It was a clear girl's 
voice. 

Perrin swung open the window, called hoarsely, "Go away!" 

She moved back, turned up her 
face and the moonlight fell upon 
her features. Perrin's voice died 
in his throat; he felt his heart 
beating wildly. 

"Go away?" she said in a soft 
puzzled voice. "I've no place 
to go. . . ." 

"Who are you?" he asked. His 
voice sounded strange to his own 
ears — desperate, hopeful. After 
all, she was possible — even 
though almost impossibly beautiful. . . . She might have flown 
out from Spacetown. "How did 
you get here?" 

She gestured at Maurnilam 
Var. "My plane went down about 
three miles out. I came over dh 
the life-raft." 

. Perrin looked along the 
water's edge. The outline of a 
life-raft was barely visible. 

The girl called up, "Are you 
going to let me in?" 

Perrin stumbled down stairs. 
He halted at the door, one hand 
on the bolts, and the blood rushed in his ears. 

An impatient tapping jarred 
his hand. "I'm freezing to death 
out here." 

Perrin let the door swing back. 
She stood facing him, half-smiling. "You're a very cautious 



lighthouse tender — or perhaps a 
woman-hater?" 

Perrin searched her face, her 
eyes, the expression of her mouth. 
"Are you — real?" 

She laughed, not at all offended. "Of course I'm real." 
She held out her hand. "Touch 
me." Perrin stared at her — the 
essence of night-flowers, soft 
silk, hot blood, sweetness, delightful fire. "Touch me," she 
repeated softly. 

Perrin moved back uncertainly, 
and she came forward, into the 
lighthouse. "Can you call the 
shore?" 

"No. . . . My transceiver is 
out of order." 

She turned him a quick firefly 
look. "When is your next relief 
boat?" 

"Eleven weeks." 

"Eleven weeks!" She sighed a 
soft shallow sigh. 

Perrin moved back another 
half-step. "How did you know 
I was alone?" 

She seemed confused. "I didn't 
know. . . . Aren't lighthouse 
keepers always alone?" 

"No." 

She came a step closer. "You 
don't seem pleased to see me. 
Are you — a hermit?" 

"No," said Perrin in a husky 
voice. "Quite the reverse. . . . 
But I can't quite get used to you. 
You're a — miracle. Too good to 
be true. Just now I was wishing 



102 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



for someone — exactly like you. 
Exactly." 

"And here I am." 
, Perrin moved uneasily. 
"What's your name?" 

He knew- what she would say 
before she spoke. "Sue." 

"Sue what?" He tried to hold 
his mind vacant. 

"Oh — just Sue. Isn't that 
enough?" 

Perrin felt the skin of his. face 
tighten. "Where is your home?" 

She looked vaguely over ~ her 
shoulder. Perrin held his mind 
blank, but the word came 
through. 

"Hell." 

Perrin' s breath came hard and 
sharp. 

"And what is Hell like?" 

"It is — cold and dark." 

Perrin stepped back. "Go 
away. Go away." His vision 
blurred; her face melted as if 
tears had come across his eyes. 

"Where will I go?" 

"Back where you came from." 

"But — " forlornly " — there is 
nowhere but Maurnilam Var. 
And up here. ..." She stopped 
short, took a swift step forward, 
stood looking up into his face. 
He could feel the warmth of her 
body. "Are you afraid of me?" 

Perrin wrenched his eyes from 
' her face. "You're not real. 
You're something which takes 
the shape of my thoughts. Perhaps you killed Seguilo. . , . 



I don't know what you are. But 
you're not real." 

"Not real? Of course I'm real. 
Touch me. Feel my arm." Perrin backed away. She said passionately, "Here, a knife, if you 
are of a mind, cut me; you will 
see blood. Cut deeper — you will 
find bone." 

"What would happen," said 
Perrin, "if I drove the knife into 
your heart?" 

She said nothing, staring at 
him with big eyes. 

"Why do you come here?" 
cried Perrin. She looked away, 
back toward the water. 

"It's magic . . . Darkness. . . ." 
The words were a mumbled confusion; Perrin suddenly realized 
that the same words were in his 
own mind. Had she merely parrotted his thoughts during the 
entire . conversation? "Then 
comes a slow pull," she said. "I 
drift, I crave the air, the moons 
bring me up. . . .1 do anything 
to hold my place in the air. ..." 

"Speak your own words," said 
Perrin harshly. "I know you're 
not real — but where is Seguilo?" 

"Seguilo?" She reached a hand 
behind her head, touched her 
hair, smiled sleepily at Perrin. 
Real or not, Perrin's pulse 
thudded in his ears. Real or 
not. ... 

"I am no dream," she said. 
"I'm real. ..." She came slowly 



WHEN THE Fl' 

toward Perrin, feeling his 
thoughts, face arch, ready. 

Perrin said in a strangled gasp, 
"No, no. Go away. Go away!" 

She stopped short, looked at 
him through eyes suddenly 
opaque. "Very well. I will go 
now — " 

"Now! Forever!" 

"—but perhaps you will call 
me back. ..." 

She walked slowly through the 
door. Perrin ran to the window, 
watched the slim shape blur into 
the moonlight, She went to the 
edge of the shelf; here she 
paused. Perrin felt a sudden in. tolerable pang; what was he 
casting away? Real or not, she 
was what he wanted her to be; 
she was identical to reality. . . \ 
He leaned forward to call,' 
"Come back — whatever you are 
— " He restrained himself. 
When he looked again she was 
gone. . . . Why was she gone? 
Perrin pondered, looking across 
the moonlit sea. He had wanted 
her. ... He had wanted her, 
but he no longer believed in 
her. . . . He had believed in the 
shape .called Seguilo; he had believed in the transceiver — and 
both had slavishly obeyed his expectations. So had the girl, and 
he had sent her^ away. 
Rightly too, he told himself regretfully. Who knows what she 
might become when his back 
was turned. ... 



r E MOONS RISE 103 

When dawn finally came, it 
brought a new curtain of overcast. Blue-green Magda glimmered dull and sultry as a moldy 
orange. The water shone like oil. 
. . . Movement in the west— a 
Panapa chieftain's private barge, 
walking across the horizon like a 
water-spider. Perrin vaulted the 
stairs to the light-room, swung 
the lumenifer full at the barge, 
despatched an" erratic series of 
flashes. 

The barge moved on, jointed 
oars swinging rhythmically in 
and out of the water. A torn 
banner of fog drifted across the 
water. The barge became a dark 
jerking shape, disappeared. 

Perrin went to Seguilo's old 
transceiver, sat looking at it. He 
jumped to his feet, pulled the 
chassis out of the case, disassembled the entire circuit. 

He saw scorched metal, wires 
fused into droplets, cracked 
ceramics. He pushed the tangle 
into a corner, went- to stand by 
the window. 

The sun was at the zenith, the 
sky was the color of green 
grapes. The sea heaved sluggishly, great amorphous swells rising 
and falling without apparent 
direction. Now was low tide; the 
shelf shouldered high up, the 
black rock, showing naked and 
strange. The sea palpitated, up, 
down, up, down, sucking noisily 
at bits of sea-wrack. 



104 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



Perrin descended the stairs. On 
his way down he looked in at 
the bathroom mirror, and his 
face stared back at him, pale, 
wide-eyed, cheeks hollow and 
lusterless. 

The face disappeared with the 
door's edge. Perrin continued 
down the stairs, stepped out into 
the sunlight. 

Carefully he walked out on 
the shelf, looked .in a kind of 
fascination down over the edge. 
Theheave of the swells distorted 
his vision; he could see little 
more than shadows and shifting 
fingers of light. 

Step by step he wandered 
along the shelf. The sun leaned 
to the west. Perrin retreated up 
the rock. 

At the lighthouse he seated 
himself in the doorway. Tonight 
the door remained barred. No 
inducement could persuade him 
to open up; the most entrancing 
visions would beseech him in 
vain. His thoughts went to 
Seguilo. What had Seguilo believed, what being had "he 
fabricated out of his morbid 
fancy with the power and malice 
to drag him away? ... It seemed 
that every man was victim to his 
own imaginings. Isel Rock was 
not the place for a fanciful man 
when the five moons rose together. 

Tonight he would bar the 
door, he would bed himself 



down and sleep, secure both in 
the barrier of welded metal and 
his own unconsciousness. 

The sun sank in a bank of 
heavy vapor. North, east, south 
flushed with violet; the west 
glowed lime and dark green^ 
dulling quickly through tones of 
brown. Perrin entered the lighthouse, bolted^ the door, set the 
twin shafts of red and white 
circling the horizon. 

He opened a dinner unit, ate 
listlessly. Outs-ide was dark night, 
emptiness to all the horizons. As 
the tide rose, the water hissed 
and moaned across the shelf. 

Perrin lay in his bed, but sleep 
was far away. Through the window came an electric glow, 
then up rose the five moons, 
shining through a high overcast 
as if wrapped in blue gauze. 

Perrin heaved fitfully. There 
was nothing to fear, he was safe 
in the lighthouse, ^o human 
hands could force the door; it 
would take the strength of a 
mastodon, the talons of a rock 
choundril, the ferocity of a Maldene land-shark. 

He elbowed himself up on his 
bunk. ... A sound from outside? He peered through the 
window, heart in his mouth. A 
tall shape, indistinct. As he 
watched, it slouched toward the 
lighthouse— as he knew it would. 

"No, no," cried Perrin softly. 
He flung kmself into his bunk

covered his head in the blankets. 
"It's only what I think up myself, 
it's not real. ... Go away," he 
whispered fiercely. "Go away." 
He listened. It must be near the 
door now. It would be lifting a 
heavy arm, the talons would glint 
in the moonlight. 

"No, no," cried Perrin. 
"There's nothing there. ..." He 
held up his head and listened. 

A rattle, a rasp at the door. 
A thud as a great mass tested 
the lock. 

"Go away!" screamed Perrin. 
"You're not real!" 

The door groaned, the bolts 
sagged. 

Perrin stood at the head of the 
stairs, breathing heavily through 
his mouth. The door would slam 
back in another instant. He knew 
what he would see : a black shape 
tall and round as a pole with 
eyes like coach-lamps. Perrin 
even knew the last sound his 
ears would hear — a terrible 
grinding discord. . . . 

The top bolt snapped, the door 
reeled. A huge black arm shoved 
inside. Perrin saw the talons 
gleam as the fingers reached for 
the bolt. 

His eyes flickered around the 
lighthouse for a weapon . . . only 
a wrench, a table-knife. 

The bottom bolt shattered, the 
door twisted. Perrin stood staring, his mind congealed. A 
thought rose up from some hid


den survival-node. Here, Perrin 
thought, was the single chance. 

He ran back into his room. Behind him the door clattered, he 
heard heavy steps. He looked 
around the room. His shoe. 

Thud! Up the stairs, and the 
lighthouse vibrated. Perrin's 
fancy explored the horrible, he 
knew what he would hear. And 
so came a voice — harsh, empty, 
but like another voice which had 
been sweet. "I told you I'd be 
back." 

Thud — thud — up the stairs. 
Perrin took the shoe by the toe, 
swung, struck the side of his 
head. 

Perrin stumbled to the wall, 
supported himself. Presently he 
groped a way to his bunk, sat 
down. 

Outside there was still dark 
night. Grunting, he looked out 
the window into the sky. The 
five moons hung far away in the 
west. Already Poidel ranged 
ahead, while Liad trailed behind. 

Tomorrow night the five 
moons would rise apart. 

Tomorrow night there would 
be no high tides, sucking and 
tremulous along the shelf. 

Tomorrow night the moons 
would call up no yearning shapes 
from the streaming dark. 

Eleven weeks to relief. Perrin 
gingerly felt the side of his head. 
.... Quite a respectable lump. 



Homecoming 



By IRVING COX, JR. 




QUINT was able to see her 
for a moment before he left. 
Her eyes were radiant with pride, 
because she had already heard 
the rumors of his appointment. 
They met in the sheltered formal 
gardens of the Council Center, 
where metal trellises and tropical 
vines towered hundreds of feet 
above them, arching in a complex pattern across the face of 
the blazing sun. 

106 



"Park, the Council voted me 
full rank as acting-Delegate!" 
He showed her 1he new, yellow rectangle fused into the 
plastic material of his sleeve. 
"I'm authorized to negotiate the 
agreement." 

"Your first mission, Quint! 
And they're allowing you to use 
the new radal-cruiser." 

She reached for his hand and 
held it shyly. It was a shocking 



breach of traditional form, for 
Park was the daughter of the 
Korbinian Council Delegate and 
Quint was only an Expediter, 
First Class, in the Interplanetary 
Assistance Corps. In spite of his 
brilliant reputation and achievements, Quint had risen as far 
as possible in Council service, unless he could earn a merit promotion by making an outstanding 
contribution to the progress of 
the Alliance. A yawning social 
gulf stood between him and 
Park; in the ancient slang, Park 
was a nyawker, Quint an ick. But 
they were in love; and it is always the persistent hope of young 
love that no miracle is impossible. • 

"If you succeed, Quint, we — 
we — " Her voice choked with 
the heady pleasure of anticipation. 

"I'll bring back an agreement, 
Park," he promised confidentially. "We're reasonably certain that 
intelligent beings inhabit Dodai. 
It may be a race like ours, or it 
may be very different; but that 
doesn't matter. They're rational, 
thinking people, technologically 
only a little inferior to us, since 
they haven't discovered space 
travel. Naturally they'll be overjoyed to share our ways and our 
ideas, just as we're anxious to 
learn theirs." 

"Of course, Quint— when they 
understand." She pursed her lips. 



.OMING 107 

"But isn't that the difficulty? 
They may be very backward. You 
might frighten them terribly, before you have a chance to 
negotiate." 

"That's why the Council is 
permitting me to make contact 
in my own way, after we reach 
Dodai." 

She held his hand tight, and 
looked into his eyes. "Don't 
make any mistakes, Quint! When 
Dodai joins the Alliance, the 
Council will vote you permanent 
rank as Delegate. I know I'm 
selfish to think of this only in 
terms of you and me, but it's 
the only way, Quint, and — and 
I love you very much." 

The voice of the space field 
dispatcher broke in on her, from 
the amplifier artfully concealed 
in the trellis above them. 

"Expediter Quint! Expediter 
Quint! Your flight is cleared." 

He turned to go, and Park 
broke another social tradition. 
She reached up .md kissed him, 
her lips lingering softly on his 
while sudden tears gleamed in 
her eyes. 

Quint's radal-cruiser was the 
first ship of its kind built by 
Alliance scientists. It was still an 
experimental craft, and one reason for the expedition to Dodai 
was to test the new radal power 
units under actual flight conditions. It was a massive, ovular 
shape, dwarfing the smaller

COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



spaceships ordinarily used for 
interplanetary travel. Christened 
the Rad-I, it was surfaced with 
an opaque, milky-gray metal, 
which was an essential part in 
the radal power cycle. 

The Rad-I had no crew; Quint 
himself had full command of the 
complex mechanisms of the ship 
from the navigational panel in 
the central control room. But 
there were three other members 
of the expedition, one from the 
Alliance Astrographical Society, 
another from the United Biological Organization, and the third 
representing the Council Physicists Association which had developed the radal motor. 

Since Quint commanded the 
Expo-mission, he had selected the 
other members of the party himself, but as a matter of course 
he had relied entirely upon the 
Council' Classifier. It was customary to feed the complex of 
probable qualifications into the 
tabulator and to allow the machine to turn up the exact name 
of the most suitable individual, 
selected from the billions of 
records on file in the central 
archives. Quint himself had been 
chosen in the same way by the 
Council. . 

Quint had not met any of his 
companions before he went 
aboard the radal-crmser. Uke 
Park, they were nyawkers ine 
term had never been legitima


tized by inclusion in the Alliance 
lexicon; handed down for generations, its origin was lost in 
the obscurity of the prehistoric 
Other Time of Quint's people. 
Anyone reared on the older 
planets, close to the throbbing 
centers of culture,- was called a 
nyawker; it was a synonym for 
culture, refinement, comfort, education, sophistication. Quint was 
referred to as an ick, because 
he came from a new, rough, 
frontier colony. He had pulled 
himself up by his bootstraps to 
the rank of Expediter. His manner was still sometimes blunt 
and a little crude. It was, perhaps, that very quality which 
made him attractive to Park. 

In spite of his background, 
Quint had been chosen to command the Expo-mission to Dodai. , 
Conceivably, there could have 
been a great deal of friction 
between him and the three 
nyawkers who went with him, 
but it was inevitable that they 
would get along well and work 
smoothly together, since compatibility of personality traits 
was a big factor in the Classifier 
selections Actually, for much of

other. The numerous compartments of the huge radal-cmiser 
were cluttered with hundreds o

the accumulation of space data 
that applied to his own area of 
specialization. 

Although the Alliance had 
enjoyed space travel For centuries, 
they had been restricted to the 
planets of their own sun system 
by the ultimate limitations of 
their motive power. Now, with 
the radal-cruiser, they were 
reaching out into the unexplored 
vastness of the Galaxy. 

To understand the universe 
was an obsession and a passion 
with Quint's people. Quint felt 
the mystic, inner drive himself, 
as he sat in the control compartment of the Rad-I. The Alliance 
had been formed by a vigorous, 
intensely curious and creative people, in many ways strangely 
adolescent in their enduring, enthusiastic joy in discovery and 
exploration. To them the generalizations of formulae derived 
from the mathematical assumptions of exact science were commonplace. But they had no 
interest in the less precise 
sociological philosophies. Thus, 
while the Alliance scientists developed radal power, harnessed 
to the radiating light waves moving through space, traditional 
customs so ruled .fheir society 
that Quint could not marry 
Parla until he^ earned a rank 
equal to hers. He chafed under 
the restriction, yet never questioned its justice. 



The billions of people inhabiting the separate planets of the 
Alliance were united by their 
fever for exploration. Gradually 
their dreams had crystallized into 
two fundamental drives: first, 
they must find a way of breaking 
out of their own sun system to examine the rest of the universe; 
and, secondly, they wanted to 
contact another rational people, 
different from themselves, and 
share their exciting accumulation of knowledge and experience. 

Long before the radal power 
was discovered, the planet of 
Dodai had been discovered by 
Professor Dodai, of the Alliance 
Astrographical Society, and 
named after him. Using the new 
Astrotelescope, he had postulated 
that some form of highly developed rational life existed on 
Dodai. The Astrographical Society had tried to communicate 
with the distant world, but apparendy none of their messages 
had reached across the void of 
space, for Dodai had never responded. 

Now it was up to Quint to 
make a physical contact with 
Dodai. He knew that he carried 
the hopes and the dreams of his 
people with him. He dared not 
fail. 

The Rad-I swung in an elliptic 
course around the globe of 
Dodai, just above the tropos


TIO 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



phere. Quint called his companions together in the control 
compartment, to plan the details 
of their landing. 

"The atmosphere isn't very 
different from our own," the 
physicist contributed. "I've made 
the Calex test twice, to be sure. 
Slightly less oxygen than we're 
accustomed to, but enough." 

The astrographer said: "Only 
this morning I observed a number of cities, which indicate a 
mature civilization. , They are 
built like ours; I doubt if the 
people will be very different." 

"It's reasonable to assume they 
have developed a way of communication by one or more of 
the radiant waves," the physicist 
guessed. "If we could record and 
classify the impulses, we might 
be able to discover the pattern of 
their language." 

"We should land secretly," 
Quint decided, "as close to one 
of their cities as possible. That 
will give us time to study their 
world, and to adjust ourselves 
to the variations in atmospheric 
structure." 

Under cover of darkness, 
Quint brought the Rad-I closer 
to the surface of Dodai. On the 
land mass below them, the 
astroscreen picked out the clear 
reflection ef crowded cities, networks of gleaming highways, and 
cultivated farmland. The radalcruiser passed over a body of 



water and hovered above another 
mass of land. Quint saw no cities 
and roads there, but instead an 
inexplicable phenomenon of 
splattering, disorganized energy 
masses. 

Thirteen miles above the confusion Quint brought the cruiser 
to a stop, centering the astroscreen upon the continent below 
and bringing in an enlargement 
at the maximum ratio. The members of the Expo-mission crowded around the screen, studying 
the weird activity. 

They saw hundreds of strange 
machines, which seemed to be 
variants of one basic design- — 
a pipe-like cylinder erected upon 
a sturdy base and directed at an 
angle toward the sky. Periodically from the mouth of this instrument a projectile was hurled, 
in a cloud of smoke and dust. 
When this projectile struck the 
ground, the sudden dispersal of 
energy was violent and destructive. Shadowy beings, indistinct 
in the darkness, manned the machines; in scattered groups, they 
were deliberately aiming the explosive destruction at each other. 

The representative of the 
United Biological Organization 
said, "They're men, I think— like 
ourselves." 

"But they're using machines to 
slay each other!" the physicist 
cried. "It's incomprehensible. 
Their cities and highways in


dicate an intelligent and rational 
people, far beyond such primitive savagery." 

"There's no logic to it — nothing we can understand," Quint 
agreed slowly, but he spoke without conviction. Sensitive to the 
mystic dreams of his people, he 
was quick to respond to the 
quality of strong emotion involved here. He felt an icy fear, 
but he could not define' it specifically, nor explain its cause, 

"Perhaps a Researcher can 
turn up an explanation," the 
astrographer suggested. 

Quint wheeled a Researching 
machine before the astroscreen 
and tabbed the image directly 
into the calculator. For a moment 
the tubes glowed and the rays 
hummed gently through the 
liquid memory tank; and then, 
in a blinding flash of light, the 
control table of the Researcher 
burst, the tubes exploded, and 
the machine lay smashed and 
silent. 

The physicist was the first to 
break the deathly quiet. " 

"It broke an inhibitor," he 
whispered. 

"Not one," Quint said mechanically. "The entire relay, I 
think." With the toe of his boot 
he began to push the pieces of 
the Researcher into a pile. "This 
— this thing down there — it must 
be the Prohibition. I've never 
known before what it was." 



OMING 1 1 1 

"Do you now?" the physicist 
asked. "Something in our own 
past has been driven out of the 
memory of our people artificially, 
with the hypnotics we administer 
at birth. We shut off all possibility of rediscovering it, by 
the relay inhibitions built into 
our Researching machines. But 
how could our Prohibition be 
related to this madness on 
Dodai?" 

_ "We have no right to ask," the 
biologist declared weakly. "Our 
Prohibition was an evil thing, a 
chain on the progress of civilization. We have freed ourselves 
by eliminating it. In that case — " 

"In that case," the astrographer took up the thought in the 
brief silence, "we cannot land 
on Dodai. We must return and 
tell the Council that our mission 
has failed." 

"When we have come so 
close?" the physicist asked, his 
voice bitter with disappointment. 
He began to pace the floor, his 
heavy boots crunching on the 
broken tubes of the Researcher. 
"No! We must try to make an 
agreement with Dodai, bring the 
new planet into the Alliance. 
The promotion to Delegate rank 
means too much to all of us." 
He paused again, clenching his 
fists. "Look at it this way: the 
Researcher is a mechanical thing; 
the relays are mechanical. There 
is no real relationship between 



112 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



Dodai and our Prohibition, but 
possibly a resemblance of some 
sort, just enough to trip the 
wrong response in the memory 
tank." 

"You're obviously right," the 
biologist said eagerly. "And I am 
anxious to catalogue the new 
life forms here; perhaps—" He 
paused and looked at Quint. 
"But it's up to Quint to make 
the decision; he's in command." 

While the three watched him 
hopefully, Quint turned back and 
looked at the astroscreen. Again 
he felt the nameless terror; but 
the memory of Park filled his 
mind, warping the function of 
logic. There was nothing else 
to do; he would never have another chance to win a merit promotion. 

Silently he went to the controls and twisted the dials; the 
gigantic cruiser began to vibrate 
gently with the whirling of its 
motors. "Back on that other continent," he said, "near one of 
the coastal cities, I noticed an 
area that seemed deserted. I 
think we can make our landing 
there." 

The others crowded around 
him, shaking his hand and clapping him on the back with unaffected joy. 

Quint brought the radalcruiser down in a wide, flat, 
desert valley rimmed with distant 
hills. He surveyed the area care* 



fully first and found it empty, 
yet within an easy distance of a 
sprawling, port city. 

As the exit-way slid down toward the rocky Earth, the air of 
Dodai hissed into the compartments of the cruiser. It was cold 
and heavy and imperceptibly 
acrid. They were shortly able to 
tolerate it, but at first it burned 
their eyes and lungs, provoking 
dry, wracking coughs. The 
physicist used one of his sensitive 
Expo-recorders to analyze the air, 
with curious results. 

"There is a definite percentage 
of partly consumed fuel particles," he told Quint. "The impregnation is probably much 
heavier in the populated centers." 

"Then the Dodaians use oil 
and coal, as we do," Quint decided. 

"But such waste! They must 
have no reason to practice conservation, or their atmosphere 
would be as clean as ours. 

"There is no such thing as an 
unlimited natural fuel; more 
probably, they simply haven't 
learned how to make a Conservator. That's one of the things 
we can show them, after they 
join the Alliance." 

Shaking his head, the physicist 
examined the Expo-recorder tape 
again. "Some of the atmospheric 
particles are unstable radiants, 
artificially created. That means 
Dodai understands and uses the 



HOMECOMING 



113 



basic energy components of elemental matter. But if their culture has advanced so far, why 
haven't they attempted space 
travel?" 

The fear suddenly gripped 
Quint again when he asked, "Do 
you suppose the explosions we 
saw — " 

"Nonsense!" the physicist cut 
in, as if he were afraid to hear 
the thought spoken. "Why 
should they direct any force so 
deadly as radiant energy at each 
other? What purpose would they 
have?" 

Before dawn they unloaded a 
number of specialized Expo-recorders from the cruiser. A small 
area of the valley floor became a 
bedlam of clicking and gyrating 
machines, analyzing, cataloguing, 
and tentatively generalizing upon 
available data. One instrument 
probed into the nearby city, on 
captive light rays. Another picked 
up the language of the Dodaians 
and began the laborious sorting 
of sound into probability patterns. More exhaustive analysis 
of the air itself filled in an outline of the technological mechanics developed on the planet. 
. As the sun arose, the desert air 
warmed quickly. Quint found it 
easier to work in the mounting 
heat. Slowly he became used to 
the difference in gravitational 
pull. By conscientiously restraining his muscles, he no longer 



leaped ridiculously into the air 
when he attempted to take a 
normal step. 

Such adjustments were customary. In ordinary interplanetary travel among the planets of 
the Alliance, Quint had learned 
to acclimate himself quickly to 
environmental changes. As an 
ick, he had grown up on the 
largest and coldest planet in his 
system, helping his father and 
his uncles to farm their vast grain 
plantation, laid out in the shadow 
of a towering mountain range, 
which was always covered with 
gleaming banks of snow. After 
he had become a member of the 
Interplanetary Assistance Corps, 
every assignment he took meant 
that he had to make bodily adjustment to strikingly different 
conditions on other inhabited 
planets. 

On Dodai, however, the anticipated ease of mind did not 
follow the physical acclimation. 
Quint felt restless and nervous. 
He kept pacing the rocky desert 
and scanning the sky — for what, 
he did not know. When he tried 
to analyze his motivation, the 
action seemed to be instinctive, 
a fear-response that had always 
been present in his mind but 
never previously recognized. 
When nightfall came, Quint felt 
an intense relief; the darkness 
somehow seemed to lessen the 
fear. 



114 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



The members of the expedi. tion brought lights out from the 
cruiser, and sat in a circle around 
a comfortable meal, pleasantly 
comparing notes on the day's accumulation of data. Only the 
biologist seemed puzzled and uneasy. Exploring in a widening 
circle, with the cruiser as its 
center, he had found many specimens of desert plant life which 
he had carefully preserved. But 
his prize find was a small animal, 
still alive. As an experiment, he 
said, he had subjected it to the 
Communicator, 

"Let me explain the function 
of the machine," he went on. 
"After sealing two receptors 
against the frontal lobe of your 
own skull, you clamp a transmission band around the brain 
case of your subject, and the 
direct communication of concepts is theoretically possible 
without the use of language symbols." 

The physicist examined the 
device with interest. "I've never 
seen anything like it," he said. 

"I shouldn't wonder. I don't 
suppose one has been built in 
the Alliance for centuries; we 
have no need for it. I found the 
design in a very old manuscript, 
dating back to that prehistoric 
Other Tfme of our past. I asked 
the laboratory to make this 
model, because I thought it might 
prove useful for communicating 



with the people of Dodai, if we 
failed to break down the symbology of their language." 

"And you used this on the 
Dodaian animal?" 

"Just from curiosity, but the 
results — well, decide for yourselves." 

The biologist tenderly brought 
a small animal from its cage, 
fastening the metal band to its 
head. The members of the expedition took up pairs of receptors and fixed the seals to their 
foreheads, while the biologist 
adjusted the dials of the transmission machine. 

As soon as the yellow tubes 
glowed, Quint felt a pulsing 
shock of terror, so intense that" 
it nearly disorganized his ability 
to conceive integrated thought. 
Like a recurring lightning flash 
in the black storm of fear, was a 
single, unwavering drive— to 
run and hide from all men. He 
smashed the seals and tore himself free of the Communicator. 

"All animals, I dare say, live 
in constant fear," the biologist 
said apologetically, by way of 
tentative explanation, "but somehow I wouldn't have visualized it 
as having quite this particular 
quality. And it's strange, don't 
you thmk, that tbp object of the 
fear seems to be only man him
All the variety of complex 
analyzers which the expedition 



HOMECOMING 



115 



had brought to Dodai had functioned admirably throughout the 
day, except for the machine 
which had been charting the 
probable language pattern. It 
had ground through reels of tape 
and produced not even an hypothetical generalization. 

After they had finished eating that evening, they gathered 
around the machine, watching it. 
The physicist guessed that the 
data was as yet too incomplete 
for any theory to emerge, but 
the astrographer was convinced 
that the quantity of data ruled 
out that possibility. He proposed 
running some of the completed 
tapes through a Researcher, on 
the chance that sound similarities with Quint's language might 
evoke a key generalization from 
the memory tank. 

But a disturbing thing happened. As Quint tabbed the tape 
into a Researcher, the tubes 
glowed and shattered again, in 
a blaze of splashing light. 

Early the next morning the 
biologist took his Communicator 
and wandered off into the blue 
mists shrouding the desert floor, 
in quest of other animal specimens. With daylight Quint's indefinable tension began again. 
He asked the biologist not to go 
out of sight of the ship, but the 
biologist discounted the warning 
and Quint saw np way to make 
it a direct order. 



While the others worked with 
their machines, Quint climbed to 
the top of the radal-cruiser and 
began to scan the sky again. He. 
felt oddly naked, as if he should 
have had some sort of a thing 
with him to protect himself. On 
the face of it, such an idea was 
absurd. Quint had never felt the 
need for an instrument of personal defense before. Except for 
the paralyzer fences used to control certain jungle animals, no 
such devices existed anywhere in 
the Alliance. 

Suddenly, in mid-morning, 
Quint heard the noise of a primitive motor in the sky. Shielding 
his eyes, he looked up and located a winged craft, a variant of a 
basic glider design. The machine 
soared in a circle over the Rad-I. 
Quint knew that a Dodaian native had at last discovered them, 
and he attempted to signal with 
his arms. 

The machine darted toward 
the cruiser, dropping a long, 
sleek projectile which struck the 
ship and exploded. No more 
harm was done than that caused 
by collision with a tiny meteorite 
in space. 

As the ship wheeled around 
and fled, Quint understood quite 
clearly the pilot's reaction. 
Frightened when he saw the massive air cruiser lying on the desert, he had tried to destroy it or 
drive it away, with one of the 



116 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



protective instruments developed by the Dodaians. Having 
failed, he would return to his 
base and spread his irrational 
fear to his people. 

No initial contact with Dodai 
could have been more unfortunate. Quint had had no opportunity to explain his mission; 
and he was dangerously close to 
failure. To head off a further 
misunderstanding, he must immediately move the cruiser to another place, where the Expomission could complete its study 
of the Dodaians and later renew 
contact more propitiously. 

Quint bawled orders to the 
physicist and the astrographer, 
who began to move their analyzing machines back into the 
cruiser. Quint himself ran across 
the desert to find the biologist. 
Beyond a low, sloping hill of 
sun-heated rock he came upon a 
hidden gorge. The biologist was 
in its depths, on the bank of a 
small, stagnant pool of greenish 
water. Crooked, heavily needled 
plant life towered over the water, 
so that Quint did not see the 
strange Dodaian machine until 
he stood directly in front of it. 

It was a four-wheeled surface 
car, roofless, very old and 
scarred. Beside it was a temporary cloth shelter, held up by 
poles and cords. Around a dying 
fire were empty, scattered containers, which may originally 



have held food. But Quint observed all that only subconsciously, as an unpleasantly vivid 
background for the person lying, 
grotesquely twisted, on the bank 
of the stagnant pool. 

Unmistakably he was a Dodaian. And he was just as unmistakably dead; 

When the biologist saw 
Quint, he sprang to his feet, 
guiltily jerking free the Communicator band which had been 
bound to the Dodaian. 

"What happened?" Quint 
asked. 

"Nothing!" The biologist's 
voice was shrill with emotion. 

"Was he dead when you 
found him?" 

The biologist drew himself up 
with a kind of weird dignity and 
answered through clenched teeth, 
"I don't have to answer questions from you — not from you!" 

The response was so bitterly 
venomous, so ridiculously illogical, Quint was speechless. The 
only explanation that occurred 
to him was that the biologist 
had suffered a violent shock. 
Only time , and understanding 
would restore his normal stability. 

"We've been sighted by a 
Dodaian aircraft," Quint said 
evenly. "We'll have to move the 
cruiser immediately." He began 
to pick up the biologist's racks 
of specimen cases. "Let me help 



HOMECOMING 



117 



you carry your things back to the 
ship." 

The biologist snatched the 
racks from him. "Don't touch 
my things!" he hissed with loathing. "Don't come near me!" 

Shrugging his shoulders, 
Quint turned away and walked 
out of the gorge. The biologist 
followed him, after he had gathered his paraphernalia into a 
pack and strapped it to his shoulders. They walked across the 
desert together, in silence. As 
they came within sight of the 
cruiser, the biologist asked 
coldly, 

"You intend to report this, of 
course?" 

"Our instructions are to — " 

"Oh, yes, follow your orders 
to the letter — that's the way people like you always climb to the 
top. For the sake of the record, 
don't imply that I killed him." 

Quint was genuinely surprised. "I know you didn't; none 
of us would; it's not our way!" 

For some reason, this amused 
the biologist tremendously. His 
brief spasm of laughter was almost hysterical. Then he said, 

"I found him camping in the 
gorge. I attempted to talk, but 
none of the regular signs worked, and he seemed afraid of me. 
Then I thought of using the 
Communicator. I showed it to 
him, but he tried to run away. 
I didn't want to bungle this op


portunity to make a contact with 
them, so I caught him and held 
him just long enough to fix the 
band on his head." 

"You were careful?" 

"He simply went unconscious 
when I touched him. I laid him 
on the ground, and he opened 
his eyes. I thought the Communicator would calm his fear, and it 
did, I'm sure. But suddenly he 
began to writhe, and he died before I could do anything for 
him." 

"Were you able to learn any 
of the fundamental concepts of 
Dodaian society?" Quint inquired eagerly. 

The biologist spat out his answer furiously. "No! Absolutely 
none!" After a pause, he added 
more quietly, "Some little of 
their language; but nothing 
else." 

"It's a pity he died, but his 
death will help us, I think. 
You've learned that the Dodaians 
are a delicate, sensitive people. 
We'll have to plan our approach 
to them carefully, to avoid all 
connotation of fear in the future." Impulsively; Quint reached 
out for the biologist's hand. "You 
mustn't blame yourself," he 
said. 

The biologist shrank from 
him, his lips drawing, back from 
his teeth in a snarl. "Don't touch 
me! 

The astrographer and the 



1 1 8 COSMOS SC 

physicist had carried their own 
Expo-recorders and analyzing 
machines back into the cruiser. 
As the biologist and Quint rejoined them, they volunteered, as 
a matter of course, to help 'the 
biologist move his equipment. 
But he rejected them scornfully, 
with the same kind of loathing 
that he directed at Quint. And 
almost at once he became involved in a bitter argument with 
the physicist, by peremptorily 
demanding the full use of a compartment which they had previously shared. 

For the first time since the 
Expo-mission had left the Alliance, Quint had to use his authority .as commander of the 
expedition. The decision wasn't 
easy, for the biologist was clearly in the wrong; yet he was just 
as clearly suffering from a severe 
emotional disturbance. Quint 
asked the physicist to move out, 
and he did so without-protest. 

But the biologist wasn't satisfied. He asked for the use of 
additional power units, which 
were needed by the astrographer. 
Quint drew the line at that, and 
the biologist sneered haughtily, 
"Your kind always stick together, don't they, Quint?" 

Because of the discord, the 
smooth-running co-operation of 
the expedition vanished. The 
four men were still outside the 
cruiser, preparing for their de


ENCE FICTION 

parture, when the Dodaians arrived. 

The vanguard was led by a 
column of heavily armored vehicles that snaked across the desert in a cloud of swirling dust 
Behind them came huge, opentopped surface cars that disgorged scores of Dodaians,. all identically dressed in unattractively 
plain, brown costumes, and 
wearing semi-spherical metal 
hats. 

The armored cars formed a 
circle around the cruiser, the 
men grouping themselves in the 
intervening gaps. They carried 
long, metallic tubes, which they 
held smartly on their shoulders. 
Quint guessed that the tube was 
an insignia of rank, like the yellow rectangle he wore on his own 
sleeve. 

Some of the Dodaians made 
haste to set up queer, three-legged, metal cylinders, ail pointed 
at the Rad-I. Similar cylinders 
projected from blisters atop the 
armored vehicles. When the arrangement seemed complete to 
the satisfaction of the Dodaians 
silence fell on the desert, and 
the clouds of dust began to 
settle. & 

Quint and the biologist were 
standing on the incline of the 
exit- way of the cruiser, the 
physicist and astrographer on the 
ground in front of them, some 
distance from the ship. Quint 



HOMECOMING 



119 



tried to analyze the purpose of 
the Dodaians facing him. As a 
yelcome, the display was bewildering. A tenuous fear flitted in and out of his mind, but 
he was too consciously preoccupied with the objective of his 
mission to heed it. 
I A rasping, meaningless voice 
screamed at them from one of 
the armored cars. Quint knew 
the appropriate gestures, and began to make them, speaking softly in his own tongue. But the 
voice broke in on him, shrilly 
imperious. 

Suddenly the biologist standing beside him threw Quint a 
look of triumph and spoke to the 
Dodaians in their own language. 
Apparently he had learned considerably more from the man in 
the gorge than he had admitted. 
Quint couldn't understand any 
reason for the biologist's secretiveness, but it didn't matter; 
the knowledge of Dodaian semantics should be of inestimable 
value now. 

But as the dialogue went on, 
the biologist's triumph faded 
' and his face twisted with fear. 
He shot a curt, quick sentence at 
the men assembled below, and 
turned to flee into the cruiser. 
At the same time an explosion 
rocked one of the armored cars, 
and a projectile struck the side 
of the cruiser. Immediately the 
Dodaians lowered their metal 



tubes, pointing them at the members of Quint's expedition. There 
was a storm of tiny explosions, 
and a rain of metal rattled 
against the Rad-I. 

In that flash of fire, Quint lost 
every rational idea save one. He 
was possessed and driven by terror, identical with the terror he 
had felt the night before when 
he applied the Communicator to 
the captured desert' animal. A 
hot flame stabbed the flesh of his 
arm. He ran up the incline into 
the cruiser, the biologist tumbling ahead of him. 

Clutching his arm in a vain 
effort to stem the spurting blood, 
Quint jammed his body against 
the control lever and the exitway slid closed. Hundreds of exploding projectiles burst against 
the sides of the cruiser. Even 
though Quint knew no damage 
could be done, he was unable to 
shake off his clutching terror. It 
was as if the Communicator had 
transferred, intact, into his mind 
the emotive pattern of the captured desert animal. The stimulus that set it off was the sight 
and sound of the metal tubes in 
the hands of the Dodaians. 

The biologist was trapped by 
the same fright, but it seemed 
to paralyze him, pound him into 
weeping hysteria. He had collapsed in a corner of the entry 
lock, and he was futilely trying 
to claw his way through the 



120 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



metal wall. Quint knew he could 
expect no help from him; the 
biologist's degeneration was complete. 

Slowly Quint pushed back his 
terror. He knew he must go into 
the control room and start the 
motors. Still holding his bleeding arm, he staggered weakly up 
the arterial corridor and dropped into the cushioned pilot's 
seat. Just before he worked the 
dials, he glanced at the groundscreen. 

The astrographer and the 
physicist were surrounded by 
Dodaians, and the astrographer 
seemed to be mortally hurt; perhaps he was already dead. A 
woven net was being drawn 
around the struggling physicist,and his captors were beginning 
to drag him toward an armored 
car. 

Trembling, Quint turned the 
dials; in his terror, he could think ' 
only of flight, and he directed 
full power into all motive units. 
The wrenching acceleration was 
unnecessarily violent For a moment Quint lost consciousness. 

When his mind cleared, the 
fear was gone. The Rad-I was 
streaking through space, miles 
above the stratosphere of Dodai. 
Quint adjusted the cruiser to a 
stable orbit. He cleansed the 
wound torn in his arm and sealed it with the cell-creating plasmatic gelatin. 



He found the biologist still 
unconscious in the entry lock, 
and carried him tenderly to his 
sleeping compartment, where 
Quint treated the bleeding lacerations in both his legs. A flattened slug of metal was lodged 
in the muscle, dose to the bone, 
but when Quint tried to remove 
it, the biologist opened his eyes 
and resisted. 

"Leave me alone!" he whispered tensely. "Don't touch me!" 

Sadly and quietly Quint held 
the biologist pressed against the 
cushion while he administered a 
hypnotic. As soon as he slept, 
Quint cut out the ugly fragment 
and sealed the wounds with the 
plasic gelatin. 

Quint went back to the control compartment to take stock 
of the situation. He was ashamed 
of the fear and cowardice he had 
shown in running from the Dodaians. He had never, before 
known such terror, but he understood why it had happened. 
The Communicator transferred 
concepts from mind to mind, 
without intervening verbalization. Thus, Quint had understood 
the fear of the Dodaian desert 
animal from that animal's point 
of view. The animal reacted instinctively, rather than rationally, 
to the thing it feared, and Quint 
had done the same when he faced 
the sairie stimulus. 

Carrying the idea farther, it 



HOMECOMING 



121 



meant that the biologist was responding with a point of view 
which he had absorbed when he 
used the Communicator on a native Dodaian. His present aversion, loathing, and bitterness 
were basic to the Dodaian mental pattern. Vaguely Quint speculated that the stimulus for that 
was the century-old Alliance 
Prohibition, something long 
buried in the prehistoric Other 
Time, and artificially wiped 
from their racial memory by the 
hypnotics administered at birth. 
Whatever it was, the stimulus 
for Quint's people was identical 
with that on Dodai. 

His ultimate conclusion was 
inescapable: Quint dared not 
carry through an agreement 
with Dodai. It meant losing his 
promotion, losing Park; but it 
was the price he would have to 

pay
He must rescue v the physicist 
and the astrographer and take 
them home to report the failure 
of their mission. Further, the 
report must be so finally discouraging that no other Expomission would ever be sent to 
contact the people of Dodai. 

It was easy enough to locate 
the physicist. The yellow insignia which the members of the 
expedition wore on their sleeves 
was activated by body heat to receive and transmit tracer impulses sent from the cruiser. It 



was an ordinary precaution taken 
by all Expo-missions, since 
scientists had a habit of losing 
themselves in the unexplored 
wonders of new worlds. 

But only the physicist's insignia responded. As Quint had 
previously surmised, the astrographer had died when they were 
captured. The physicist had been 
taken not to the port city near 
the desert, but across the land 
mass to a larger city on the opposite coast. Hovering as low as 
he dared over the city, Quint 
dialed the astroscreen up to its 
highest ratio of enlargement. At 
such a distance the electronic 
picture was at best fuzzy and inaccurate, but it seemed to indicate that the physicist had been 
taken into a parklike area and 
imprisoned in some sort of a 
metal-walled house. 
. Quint knew the Dodaians 
would resist- any attempt at rescue with the noisy, deadly explosives they used so freely. 
How was he to go among them, 
to release the physicist, without 
being killed himself? He tabbed 
the problem into a Researcher, 
and the machine gave him the 
answer in the form of a schematic plan for a specially charged 
webbing which he was to wear 
beneath his plastic uniform. 
Quint's knowledge of science 
was general, rather than specific, 
and he was not certain how the 



122 COSMOS SC 

webbing would function, except 
that it would encase him in an 
artificial magnetic field which 
would deflect any metal object 
approaching it. 

Quint was entirely capable of 
building according to the diagram, and there was ample 
material aboard the Rad-I which 
could be converted to the purpose. But it was slow work. Dodai turned thrice on its axis before the rigid webbing and its 
power unit were completed. 

The biologist recovered quickly, at least in a physical sense. 
He was clearly trying to conquer 
the crawling revulsion he felt 
whenever he was near Quint. He 
tried to be friendly, to chat 
pleasantly, but the effort was a 
miserable failure. Quint sawthat it drove the biologist almost 
to the point of nausea to have to 
eat at the same table with him, 
and, to ease the situation, Quint 
took the biologist's meals to his 
compartment so that he could eat 
alone. 

When the biologist saw that 
Quint meant to return to Dodai 
to rescue the physicist, he was 
viciously overjoyed. 

"We can wipe out the planet, 
Quint!" His eyes blazed with delight. 

"Wipe out? I don't think I 
understand the phrase." 

"Destroy them; slaughter 
them; lay waste their land!" 



:NCE FICTION 

"But why? What evil fills you 
with so much hatred that you reject all the ethics of our people? 
We don't destroy; we build'" 

"It's the only kind of contact 
the Dodains would understand 
or respect." The biologist paced 
the floor, rubbing his hands. 
"And we could do it so easily; 
so very ^easily! Use one of our 
spare radal tubes; make a small 
change in the light converter; 
and aim the output vent at their 
cities. It would sweep them into 
dust, with the fire of a new sun." 

Respecting the biologist's evident madness, Quint allowed 
him to rave as he pleased, making no comment. But when 
Quint was ready to return to Dodai, he took the precaution of 
lacing the biologist's food with 
a soothing sleep-hypnotic when 
■ he left his meal in his compartment. 

Under cover of darkness, 
Quint dropped toward the 
planet in an emergency rocket 
escape raft. Tracer beams guided 
him into the park where the 
physicist was held. 

He had miscalculated the protectiveness of the night hour, for 
scattered groups of Dodaians 
were strolling in the park. They 
fled in terror when they saw him, 
and the lights went out in the 
towering city buildings while 
sirens screamed in the streets. 

Quint was amazed that they 



HOMECOMING 



123 



recognized him so quickly, and 
that their fear was so great. His 
costume was different from 
theirs, of course, but otherwise 
they were rational people, just 
as he was. How could they De so 
certain, after only a cursory 
glance, that he was not one of 
themselves, simply masquerading 
in a peculiarly bizarre kind of 
dress? » 

In the pale moonlight he began to follow the throbbing of 
his tracer unit toward the physicist's prison. A black van careened past him, and seconds 
later a blaze of white floodlights 
centered upon a large, barred 
cage. Quint saw the physicist inside, clinging to the metal bars. 
Dodaians carrying their gleaming metal tubes were grouped in 
front of the prison; others, in 
similar uniforms, were gathering 
at the spot from all directions. 

As Quint walked slowly toward them, they pointed their 
tubes at him. The terrifying explosions shook the quiet, night 
air. When Quint continued to 
stand unharmed, a cry of dismay 
passed over the Dodaians. One 
who seemed to be a leader shouted something at Quint, and 
sprang up by the cage, pointing 
his deadly tube at the physicist. 

Quint understood the pantomime well enough. Since they 
could not stop him, they were 
threatening to slay the man he 



had come to save. Quint stood 
still, trying to convey his purpose through gesture and the 
quiet gentleness of his voice. 

Four Dodaians moved toward 
him, carrying a large, metal-linked net. They clearly meant to 
take him prisoner, too.- He shook 
his head and tried to communicate with them again. The Dodaian leader merely screamed at 
him and prodded the physicist 
with the point of his metal tube. 

The physicist called out & 
warning to Quint, but he did not 
understand it above the seething 
din of Dodaian voices. He began to back away. The four men 
carrying the net sprang at him. 
Quint's artificial negative field 
repulsed the metal, hurling the 
net back and bowling over the 
men. 

This terrified them. Some of 
the uniformed Dodaians threw 
down their metal tubes and fled. 
The leader by the cage exhorted 
them, with no result. When he 
saw that Quint was moving toward him, he turned in desperation and fired his tube again and 
again into the- body of the physicist. 

Quint cried out as if the death 
agony had !>:en his own. 

At that moment white light 
blazed in the sky. The city rocked in flaming destruction. The 
earth shook so that %iint could 
not stand. A hurricane of searing 



124 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



wind roared over the park, stripping the trees of leaves, ripping 
the loose gravel from the path. 
Quint reeled drunkenly in the 
falling, blazing debris, holding 
his hands over his bleeding face 
while the skin blistered and 
peeled away. In the nightmare 
darkness beyond the park the 
proud city towers were collapsing; above the concussion of 
shattering walls, Quint heard the 
occasional shrieks of trapped Dodaians. 

Something fell heavily at his 
feet. It was a charred strip of 
wood, with familiar letters painted upon it. He picked it up and 
he was still holding it in his hand 
when the Rad-I settled clumsily 
into the park. The exit- way 
opened, and the biologist ran 
out to drag Quint toward the 
ship. 

"I followed you with the 
•ground-screen," the biologist 
shouted. "When I saw them kill 
the physicist, I had to use the 
radal weapon. It's the only language these people understand." 

"But I — I gave you — '■" Quint 
couldn't speak above a whisper; 
after fr/e words his voice failed 
altogether. 

"The hypnotic? I thought you 
might, so I ate none of my food." 

Quint's legs moved sluggishly. It was impossible, for him to 
climb the incline into the ship. 
Controlling his loathing, the 



biologist began to drag him up 
the exit-way. They were at the 
door when Dodaian airships attacked them. Quint's webbing 
protected him from the spattering metal, but the biologist 
screamed and collapsed. 

Quint was able to help his 
companion into the lock and to 
push the lever that closed the 
exit-way. 

"Get us off the ground," the 
biologist cried. "Then sterilize 
yourself — particularly your exposed skin — and cover your entire body with the plasmatic 
gelatin. I think you weren't out 
there long enough for the damage to be fatal." 

Fighting burning pain and the 
grasping mists of unconsciousness, Quint climbed slowly into 
the control compartment. He 
turned the dials and the radalcruiser shot up out of the ruined 
city. Breathing heavily, he stripped off his tattered uniform and 
washed his skin with the sterilizing fluid. It was like the distorted action of a dream. His 
head swam, and a slow weakness dragged heavily on his 
muscles. 

But as soon as he applied the 
gelatin, the pain ebbed and his 
mind began to clear. He checked 
the position of the cruiser on the 
astroscreen and saw that the 
planet of Dodai was a small 
sphere, receding behind them. 



HOMECOMING 



125 



He set a course for the Alliance, 
and went to help the biologist 
The biologist was lying motionless in a spreading pool of 
blood. Beneath him was the 
charred, lettered board that 
Quint had carried away from Dodai. Quint realized that the 
biologist's wounds were fatal, 
and he felt a bitter pang of remorse that he had not taken care 
of the biologist first, before looking after his own burns. Yet, if 
he had, he wouldn't have had 
the strength to pilot the Rad-I 
away from Dodai. In spite of the 
biologist's insane aversion to 
Quint, he had saved the cruiser 
and its records of the expedition 
by sacrificing himself. 

Quint carried the biologist to 
his compartment and gave him 
drugs to ease the pain. After a 
time, the biologist opened his 
eyes; when the first wave of revulsion had passed over his face, 
he tried to smile. He spoke so 
softly his voice was almost inaudible. 

"You must go home and tell 
them, Quint; tell them never to 
send another Expo-mission to 
Dodai." 

"I understand; the people 
here are still too primitive for 
Alliance membership. In centuries to come — " 

. "No, Quint! It's the Prohibition! They will never be able — " 
The biologist began to cough, 



and blood weljed from his 
mouth. He seemed to gesture toward the Communicator lying 
beside his couch. Quint thought 
he understood, although the 
biologist shook his head weakly 
as Quint fixed the band to his 
forehead. 

Quint adjusted the receptors 
and turned up the power. In the 
instant of the biologist's death, 
Quint dragged from his tortured 
mind the concepts he had tried 
to conceal. It was the thing the 
biologist had learned from the 
Dodaian. 

Quint's first recognizable generalization was a satisfying sense 
of group superiority. He was 
himself a master of all men, and 
deservedly so. In that moment 
Quint recovered from the hypnotic that had been given him at 
birth. It was as if a curtain 
rolled back, and he saw himself 
for the first time — tall, handsome, beautifully proportioned, 
alert, intelligent, capable of 
greatness in ail things. And he 
saw the people of the Alliance, 
too — the sniveling, weak, whitehaired monster which had been 
the ^biologist; the blue-scaled 
horror which was the physicist; 
and all the countless nightmare 
variations on all the planets of 
the Alliance. 

These were the people he had 
always known, as he had always 
seen them; but for the first time 



126 

he saw them in physical appearance, rather than in the personality patterns which he had 
learned to define as persons. 
They were all beasts — weird, inhuman, incapable sub-races. Only 
the scattered few who were like 
himself in biological structure 
continued to exist as persons. 
For Quint the inner spirit which 
held the Alliance together vanished, and he saw. only the horror of the outer shell. 

He tore the receptors from his 
head, but he could not tear the 
awareness out of his soul. He 
looked on the bleeding hulk of 
the biologist and was supremely 
glad that he had died in pain and 
alone. 

By the whim of chance, Quint 
was twice insulated from the full 
impact of the Dodaian psychology — first, because the knowledge had been filtered through 
the mind of the biologist, as he 
struggled to conquer his acquired aversion; and, secondly, 
because the biologist, had fought 
so hard to hold back the truth 
before he died. 

Quint plunged to the edge of 
madness, but the rationality he 
had known all his life held him 
back. Slowly he began to understand the 6ther Time of his people. It was not a period of 
pre-history, but of erased-history. In that day Quint's people 
had been like the Dodaians, but 



COSMOS SCIENCE FICTION 



the diverse and warring groups 
had been welded together by 
artificially wiping out their 
hereditary group hatreds and distrusts. The hypnotics taught 
them to define men in terms of 
personality, rather than of physical appearance. Their reward 
had been interplanetary unity, at 
the small price of solidifying a 
part of their individual minds 
permanently on the level of 
childhood. For it was only the 
child who never saw significance 
in the differences of racial appearance. 

The old pattern had been 
oddly sublimated into a subconscious drive by the people of the 
Alliance to discover a rational 
race different from themselves. 

Slowly Quint recovered from 
the madness of Dodai— as much 
as he ever would. The important 
thing, he realized, was to save 
the Alliance from ever discovering the truth. To do that, the 
Expo-mission must fail completely; none of its records cou!d~be 
examined or recovered. 

Quint brought Che R a d-I j n 
close to the central Alliance 
planet, and failed the power 
units. He mounted a \ ocket 
emergency raft and moved ou 
in space taking with him the 
converted radal tube which thl 



HOMECOMING 



127 



upon the cruiser, and watched it 
flame into nothingness. Then he 
took the tube apart and abandoned the pieces in space. 

The only memento -he saved, 
as a kind of ironic personal reminder of the truth he never 
dared share, was the charred 
board he had brought with him 
from the burning city. 

He landed and made his report to the Council. The Expomission had reached Dodai, hesaid, and f ound an uninhabitable 
planet; on the return trip, the 
radal motor had failed; only 
Quint had escaped the catastrophe. 

He went into the formal garden to await the decision of the 
Council. Quint had no doubt 
that they would remove his temporary rank of Delegate, as the 
price of failure; but he had no 
regret of that. As soon as he 
could, he would resign from the 
Interplanetary Assistance Corps 
and go back to his native planet, 
to live out his years farming his 
father's plantation. In such loneliness and desolation he would 
have no chance to reveal the 
truth, even in an unguarded moment. 

"Quint! Quint, dear!" Parla 
came to sit beside him. She tried 
to kiss him, and he moved away, 
sweat breaking out on his face 
and hands. "Don't be dejected, 
Quint; I think they may give you 



the merit promotion for bravery, 
even though you brought back 
no agreement. My father, promised to speak in your favor." 

His mind cried out in horror, and his voice caught in his 
throat; he looked away from her 
quickly, so that she would not 
see his face. 

"What was it like, Quint — 
this dead planet of Dodai?" 

Frantically he -pulled from 
his coat the fragment of wood 
he had saved and showed it to 
-her; he must concentrate on that 
-^on anything — even the. fabric 
of a new lie, to hold back the 
evil that was crawling inside his 
soul. "In one of their ruined 
cities, I picked this up," he said 
dully. 

"Their letters are like ours, 
and the words— isn't it odd? If 
you say them quickly, it's what 
we call ourselves!" 

A voice came over the amplifier summoning Quint to the 
Council chamber — for formal 
ceremony of commendation. He 
stood up and Parla faced him, 
her face radiant, her eyes brimming with tears of joy. 

"They've voted you the promotion, Quint!" She threw her 
arms around him, and her lips 
were warm and liquid on his. 
"You're a Delegate, Quint. That 
means that we — you and I — oh, 
Quint, it's everything we 
dreamed of!" 



728 COSMOS SC 

She dropped the charred 
. board, and, while they kissed, 
her feet rested upon it. Quint 
fought the horror in his mind, 
and tried to shut his eyes against 

For Park was a hideously 
purple-scaled monstrosity. Her 
arms, roughly gnarled, gleaming 
with the nauseous fluid exuded 
by her race, lay like sometning 
filthy on the clean, clear brown 
of his own skin. He had lost the 
vision of the person he loved, in 
looking upon the biological shell 
that housed it. 

Parla touched the fragment 
of wood with her toe and read 
the letters aloud. 

"NEW YORK P— . That 
must have been the name of 



■NCE FICTION 

their city, Quint. The letters are 
exactly like ours, and if you slur 
the words they sound a little like 
our slang expression — you know, 
what we call our sophisticates', 
the nyawker. I wonder if there's 
any -relationship between our 
people and the Dodaians?" 

That was it, Quint thought 
desperately. Concentrate on the 
meaningless fluff of that enigma, 
bury all conscious thought in a 
problem that could never be 
solved; in time, perhaps, the 
horror would pass. 

The voice on the amplifier 
summoned him again, and he 
walked reluctantly toward the 
Council hall, to receive the highest award his people could give 
him.
