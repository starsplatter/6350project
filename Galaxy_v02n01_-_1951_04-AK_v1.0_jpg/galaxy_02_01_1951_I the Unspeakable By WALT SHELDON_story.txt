I, the Unspeakable By WALT SHELDON 



I FOUGHT to be awake. I was 
dreaming, but I think I must 
have blushed. I must have 
blushed in my sleep. 

"Do it.'" she said. "Please do it! 
For me!" 

It was the voice that always 
came, low, intense, seductive, the 
sound of your hand on silk . . . 
and to a citizen of Northern, a conformist, it was shocking. I was a 
conformist then; I was still one that 
morning. 

1 awoke. The glowlight was on, 
slowly increasing. I was in my living machine in Center Four, where 
I belonged, and all the familiar 
things were about me, reality was 
back, but I was breathing very hard. 

I lay on the pneumo a while before getting up. I looked at the 
chroner: 0703 hours, Day 17, 

Month IX, New Century Three. 
My morning nuro-tablets had already popped from the tube, and 
the timer had begun to boil an egg. 
The egg was there because the 
realfood allotment had been increased last month. The balance of 
trade with Southern had just swung 
a decimal or two our way. 

I rose finally, stepped to the mirror, switched it to positive and 
looked at myself. New wrinkles — 
or maybe just a deepening of the 
old ones. It was beginning to 
show; the past two years were leaving traces. 

I hadn't worried about my appearance when I'd been with the 
Office of Weapons. There, I'd been 
able to keep pretty much to myself, 
doing research on magnetic mechanics as applied to space drive. But 
other jobs, where you had to be 
among people, might be different. 
I needed every possible thing in my 
favor. 

Yes, I still hoped for a job, 
even after two years. I still meant 
to keep on plugging, making the 
rounds. 

I'd go out again today. 

The timer clicked and my egg 
was ready. I swallowed the tablets 
and then took the egg to the table 
to savor it and make it last. 

As I leaned forward to sit, the 
metal tag dangled from my neck, 
catching the glowlight. My identity 
tag. 

Everything came back in a 
rush — 



My name. The dream and her 
voice. And her suggestion. 

Would I dare? Would I start out 
this very morning and take the risk, 
the terrible risk? 

YOU remember renumbering. 
Two years ago. You remember 
how it was then; how everybody 
looked forward to his new designation, and how everybody made 
jokes about the way the letters came 
out, and how all the records were 
for a while fouled up beyond recognition. 

The telecomics kidded renumbering. One went a little too far and 
they psycho-scanned him and then 
sent him to Marscol as a dangerous 
nonconform. 

If you were disappointed with 
your new designation, you didn't 
complain. You didn't want a sudden visit from the Deacons during 
the night. 

There had to be renumbering. 
We all understood that. With the 
population of Northern already past 
two billion, the old designations 
were too clumsy. Renumbering was 
efficient. It contributed to the good 
of Northern. It helped advance the 
warless struggle with Southern. 

The equator is the boundary. I 
understand that once there was a 
political difference and that the two 
superstates sprawled longitudinally, 
not latitudinally, over the globe. 
Now they are pretty much the 
same. There is the truce, and they 
are both geared for war. They are 



82 




 



both efficient states, as tightly controlled as an experiment with 
enzymes, as microsurgery, as the 
temper of a diplomat. 

We were renumbered, then, in 
Northern. You know the system: 
everybody now has six digits and 
an additional prefix or suffix of four 
letters. Stateleader, for instance, 
has the designation AAAA111/111. Now, to address somebody by calling off four letters is a 
little clumsy. We try to pronounce 
them when they are pronounceable. 
That is, no one says to Stateleader, 
"Good morning, A- A- A- A." They 
say, "Good morning, Aaaa." 

Reading the last quote, I notice a 
curious effect. It says what I feel. 
Of course I didn't feel that way on 
that particular morning. I was still 
conformal; the last thing in my 
mind was that I would infract and 
be psycho-scanned. 

Four letters then, and in many 
cases a pronounceable four letter 
word. 

A four letter word. 

Yes, you suspect already. You 
know what a four letter word can 
be. 

Mine was. 

It was unspeakable. 

The slight weight on my forehead reminded me that I still wore 
my sleep-learner. I'd been studying 
administrative cybernetics, hoping 
to qualify in that field, although it 
was a poor substitute for a space 
drive expert. I removed the band 
and stepped across the room and 



turned off the oscillator. I went 
back to my egg and my bitter memories. 

I will never forget the first day I 
received my new four letter combination and reported it to my chief, 
as required. I was unthinkably embarrassed. He didn't say anything. 
He just swallowed and choked and 
became crimson when he saw it. He 
didn't dare pass it to his secretarial 
engineer; he went to the administrative circuits and registered it 
himself. 

I can't blame him for easing me 
out. He was trying to run an efficient organization, after all, and no 
doubt I upset its efficiency. My 
work was important — magnetic mechanics was the only way to handle 
quanta reaction, or the so-called 
non-energy drive, and was therefore the answer to feasible space 
travel beyond our present limit of 
Mars — and there were frequent inspection tours by Big Wheels and 
Very Important Persons. 

Whenever anyone, especially a 
woman, asked my name, the embarrassment would become a crackling 
electric field all about us. The best 
tactic was just not to answer. 




HE chief called me in one day. 
He looked haggard. 



"Er — old man," he said, not quite 
able to bring himself to utter my 
name, "I'm going to have to switch 
you to another department. How 
would you like to work on nutrition 
kits? Very interesting work."

her, seeing her young figure and 
her light hair and her mouse-colored eyes, and not really knowing 
why. 

I had the overpowering desire 
to spring forward and throttle the 
two Deacons and help the prisoners to escape. Almost overpowering. I didn't, naturally. 

The jetcopter lowered toward 
the great green parks that cover the 
topside area of Center One. It was 
really refreshing to see them. I 
understood that the lucky residents 
of Center One were allowed to 
wander in these parks, and look at 
the growing things and the sky. 
Then, presently, the parks were out 
of sight again and we were settling 
on the concrete landing stage and 
I was back to reality. 

THE first contact at the Office 
of Pyschological Adjustment 
was, as usual, an information desk. 
There were people instead of cybs 
to greet you and I suppose that was 
because of the special complications 
of problems brought here. The 
cybs have their limits, after all. 

A gray man with a gray eye and 
a face like a mimeographed bulletin 
looked at me and said, in approved 
voice and standard phraseology, 
"what information is desired?" 
I told him. 

His eyebrows rose, as if suddenly buoyant. "Change your name? 
That's impossible." 

I quoted, verse and chapter, the 
regulation covering it. "H'm," he 



said. His eyebrows came down, 
cuddling into a scowl. "Well, 
that's highly unusual procedure. 
Better let me see your identity tag." 

I gave that to him and he saw 
my N/P status, and then my unspeakable name, and his eyebrows 
went up again. 

"Perhaps you'd better get this 
straightened out with General Administration first," he said. He 
scribbled a slip of paper, showing 
me how to get there. 

The rat race was on. 

I found General Administration. 
They sent me to Activity Control. 
Activity Control said they couldn't 
do a thing until I was registered. I 
went to Registration. Registration 
said oh, no, I shouldn't have been 
sent there — although they'd try to 
direct me to the proper office if I 
got an okay from Investigation and 
Security. I. & S. said the regulation 
I quoted had been amended and 
I would have to have the amendment first and I could find that in 
Records. Records sent me back to 
the first place to get a Search Permit. 

And so on. 

I kept at it doggedly. Toward 
the end of the day my legs ached 
and head felt like a ball of granite. 
I had discovered that Opsych had 
nearly as many levels and tunnels 
and bays as Center Four in its entirety, and I had taken the intercom 
cars when possible, but most of it 
had been walking. I tightened my 
jaw and pulled my stomach in. I'd 



94 




 



get to see the Chief if it took me 
a year. 

That was hyperbole, of course. 
No man could last a year walking 
those dim, monotonous, aseptic corridors. How can I describe the 
feeling? The corridors are the same 
wherever you go. The glowlight 
comes steadily, unblinkingly, from 
the walls. The color is a dead oyster 
white. 

There is always the feeling of 
being lost — even when you know, 
or think you know, exactly where 
you are. 

IT WAS near the end of the day 
and I was back at the information desk. 

"You again," said the gray man 
with the gray eye. 

"Records says I need a Search 
Permit. I have to find an amendment on the regulation covering 
my case." 

"Why don't you just give up? 
You're causing us a great deal of 
trouble, you know. We have other 
work to do. Important work." 

"So have I. I'm a magnetic mechanics expert. I could be working 
for the State right now if I could 
get a post. I can't get a post till my 
name's changed." 
"That's ridiculous." 
"I agree. But it's true just the 
same." • 

"Well, here's your Search Permit. But I still think you'd be wiser 
to forget it. And you'd save us a 
lot of fuss." 



I leaned across the desk. "You 
could save the whole organization a lot of fuss if you'd direct 
me to the Chief's office. Then I 
could take my case up with him 
directly. I've been keeping my eye 
open for it, but I can't find it anywhere, and of course nobody' 11 direct me there, even if they know 
where it is." 

He stared at me with mild 
horror. "Go direct to the Chief's 
office? Without going through 
channels?" 

"Well, that's what I had in 
mind." 

"Then you'd better get it out of 
your mind. That's pretty dangerous 
thinking. That's close to infraction." 

"All right." I sighed. TU do 
it the hard way." I took the Search 
Permit and went back to Records. 
I was still searching for the amendment when closing time came. 

I went back into the dim white 
corridors and found a foodmat, got 
some nuro-pills and reviewed the 
day. These workers here in Center 
One were experts at putting you 
off. They were much more skilful 
than the officials in Center Four. 
Maybe that was why they were in 
Center One. Maybe I never would 
wear them down. 

That thought came along and 
formed a ball of ice right in the 1 
bottom of my stomach. 

I had to think. I had to think 
and rest. Real air and a night breeze 
would help. 



I, THE UNSPEAKABLE 



95 



I found a shaft and went topside. 

I started walking along a winding trail in the great park. The stars 
were out. They were diamonds, 
ground to dust, and thrown carelessly across the black velvet of the 
sky. The moon had not yet risen. 
There was a breeze, cool and light, 
and it brought temporary sanity. At 
least it helped me realize I was 
tired. 

I came to a little brook, and, instead of crossing the foot bridge, I 
turned and followed the brook upstream. It led through groves of 
trees and presently I found a little 
clearing where the bank sloped 
gently and was covered with soft 
moss. At the water's edge, the bank 
and a rock formation made a kind 
of overhanging ledge and I sat on 
this a while and stared at the water, 
liquid silver, tumbling below. 

Finally I moved up the bank a 
little, wrapped my cloak around me 
and lay down. I looked at the stars. 
I wondered which one might be 
Mars. It was red, I'd heard, but I 
saw nothing like that. Probably it 
wasn't visible now. I got to thinking about Mars, and I got to thinking about the prison colony there, 
and then I got to thinking about 
the primitive life, and then freemating. 

That made me think of Lara, and 
her firm body and long, clean 
limbs and blonde hair and mousecolored eyes. 

I drifted off to sleep. Lara 



stayed with me; she stepped into 
my dream. It was a wonderful 
dream. Her voice, when' she broke 
from standard, was thrilling and 
delicious. It was linked with the 
tumbling of the brook somehow. 
She was warm and vibrant in my 
arms. She was alive, so alive. She 
was all movement. 

We were laughing together 
and . . . 

I AWOKE to the sound of shooting. 

The moon had risen and the 
broad glades were silver green and 
the trees were casting shadows. 
Voices were barking back and forth 
within the woods. 

"Over that way!" called one. 

"Cut 'em off! Cut 'em off!" 
yelled another. 

A man and woman, both entirely naked, both speckled with 
wounds and bruises, all standard 
in questioning, stumbled into the 
clearing. Their eyes were wild, big 
for their faces. They were thin. 
They gasped for breath. They 
looked around them, rats in mazes, 
and then saw me. 

They drew back. 

"This way!" called a voice from 
the wood. 

Another shot rang out. 

I stared at the man and woman, 
still too surprised to know what to 
do or say. 

They were the two prisoners I 
had seen in the jetcopter on my 
way to Center One.

IV 

MAYBE I was not quite awake. 
Maybe I was not really 
bright, though everybody thinks of 
himself as bright, I suppose. Maybe it was everything that had happened since the renumbering. 
Maybe I was fed up and maybe 
something about the quiet woods 
called out: Rebel! Rebel! 
I don't know. 

I pointed to the brook, the overhanging bank, and said, "In there! 
Quick!" 

They scuttled. They passed me 
and looked at me half-thankfully, 
half-fearfully. 

The voices came nearer. 

"Come on! This way! They can't 
get far!" 

I wrapped myself in my cloak 
and sat down and pretended to be 
gazing at the stars. 

A moment later three Deacons 
burst upon the clearing. I turned 
slowly, and stared at them, showing mild artificial surprise. Handsome, burly fellows. The one in the 
middle was a positive Apollo; I 
was sure that he waved his hair. 
He glared at me. 

"You," he said. 

"Me?" 

"Yes, you. What are you doing 
here?" 

I said, "I'm sitting here." 
"What for?" ' 

"The night air. To study the 
stars. Get a change of scene." I 
shrugged. 



Apollo stepped forward and held 
out his hand. "Your tag." 

This was it. When he saw my 
four letter name he'd really start 
working on me. I unsnapped the 
tag from my neck band and handed 
it to him. 

He looked at it, but didn't change 
expression. The Deacons are welltrained. He looked up again. "N/P, 
eh?" 

"Yes." 

"And you belong in Center 
Four." 
"Yes." 
"Explain." 

I did. Or tried to. Things were 
roiling around inside me, keeping 
me from thinking clearly. Once, as 
I talked, I thought I heard movement under the bank, but the Deacons didn't seem to notice anything. 
I tried to tell them of my troubles. 

There was no sympathy in their 
eyes. 

Apollo said, "See anybody pass 
by here?" 

"Pass by?" I hoped my look 
was innocent. "Who?" 

"Two fugitives. Nonconforms. 
Escaped during interview. Got the 
force screen turned off somehow — 
must have had spies helping them. 
You didn't see them, eh?" 

I shook my head. "I haven't seen 
anyone for several hours." 

APOLLO and his two friends 
traded glances. The one on 
the right was bull-necked and redheaded; the one on the left had a 



I. THE UNSPEAKABLE 



97 



neck and nose like a crane. It was 
the one on the left who suddenly 
smiled. Not a pleasant smile. He 
stepped up to Apollo and whispered something in his ear. Then 
Apollo smiled and turned to me 
again. 

"You're sure you haven't seen 
anyone." 

He knew something. I didn't 
know what, but it was too late to 
back, out now. I said, "Of course 
I'm sure." 

Apollo kept his eyes on me, hard, 
flat, stony, and held out his hand 
to the cranelike Deacon. "Your 
light," he said. The other handed 
it to him. Apollo flashed it on the 
ground. It came to rest upon unmistakable footprints in the soft 
moss. They led to the bank. 

I could be certain of arrest, and 
one of their little interviews now. 
I really had nothing to lose. Nothing that wasn't already lost — 

"Run!" I shouted at the top of 
my lungs. "They're coming!" 

There was a rustling under the 
bank. 

I leaped at Apollo. I leaped hard, 
with my feet solid, pushing me forward. My shoulder hit him in the 
midriff. He went down. I scrambled over him and jammed my 
thumb into his shoulder. He 
screamed. 

There was a buzzing sound and 
the smell of burned flesh, and a 
tenth of a second later I felt pain. 
One of the others had jammed his 
electric truncheon into the small of 



my back. It bored in, it burned, 
and I writhed and yelled. I couldn't help it. I rolled over. 

Someone was kicking at me. I 
grabbed his leg and pulled him 
down and when he struck the 
ground I twisted. Another shape 
bluned toward me — Apollo, recovered and on his feet again. Then 
buzzing, burned flesh, and the pain 
this time in the back of my neck. 
My head swirled. I thrashed, trying to get away. Get away where? 
That made not much difference. 
Away, that was all. 

The buzzing continued. It was 
through my flesh now and touching 
the spine. It would destroy the 
nerves in a moment. I would be 
dead — or even worse, a limp 
cripple, a rag doll. 

The smell of roasted flesh and 
hair was a thick, choking, sickening 
fog of decay. I couldn't breathe. 
There was blackness, swirling and 
concentric, closing in. 

I think one of them kicked me 
in the groin before I lost consciousness. 

I couldn't be sure. I couldn't be 
sure of anything. 

COMING out. Sound before 
sight and I heard the low 
voices. My eyes were already open. 
Nebulous shapes, now sharpening. 

I was in a small room with 
gleaming metal walls and I was on 
my back on a sort of table. Three 
men were in the room with me, 
standing over me. Apollo . . . the 



98 




 



bull-necked man . . . the man with 
the nose like a crane. 

Apollo was smiling. Pour water 
over that smile and immediately a 
film of ice would form. 

"A spy," said Apollo, looking 
into my open eyes. "Another damn 
spy." 

I shook my head. Ridiculous, 
but that's what I did. The movement pulled at the wound in the 
back of my neck and sharp pain, 
starting there, shot through my 
whole body. I grimaced and 
groaned. 

Apollo laughed, then suddenly 
brought his club hard across my 
face. My cheekbone seemed to 
make a crunching sound. 

"A spy, a damned spy," said 
Apollo. 

"We got a confession for you 
to sign," said the Crane. 

Apollo said, "Shut up. Not yet. 
We got to interview him first." 

"Look," I said, trying to lift 
my head, trying to rise upon my 
elbows, "call your chief. Call anybody like that. I can explain this 
whole thing. It's a long story — " 




E HIT me again across the 
other cheekbone. 



Shall I describe the next timeless 
endless hour? All the details? I 
don't remember all of them, of 
course, just the moments of sharpest pain that lifted me from the 
daze. Just the sound of my own 
screaming at times, and the helpless dryness of my own throat, and 



the sounds that kept coming from 
it even when the vocal cords were 
numb. 

Apollo and his pals had fun. 

There were the electric clubs. 
They become so hot at the tip that 
they will burn through an inch of 
pine in a couple of seconds. They 
go even quicker through flesh. 
After a while the smoke of my 
own burning flesh was thick in the 
room, and we all choked a little 
On it. 

They had more fun with fhcir 
fists, though. They didn't burn me 
in the worst places. They saved 
them for their fists and hands. 

After a while I couldn't scream. 
Only a hoarse, helpless, retching 
sound came out whenever I opened 
my mouth. 

Did I hear their voices then? I 
couldn't be sure whether I heard 
them speak, or whether I dreamed 
that they spoke. 

"He can't feel it any more now." 
That was Apollo's voice. 

"Wake him up again," said the 
Crane. "Give him a shot." 

"Oh, hell, I'm hungry," said 
Apollo. 

"All right," said the Crane, 
"let's go get something to eat. We 
can always come back again." 

Blackness, sweet blackness; and 
the sense of floating among the 
stars. Nothingness. It was exquisite now . . . even the touch of 
agony that still seeped through was 
exquisite. 

Hew much of this, I don't know. 



I, THE UNSPEAKABLE 



99 



I heard a voice again, and at 
first I thought my precious blackness was leaving me. I struggled 
to keep it. I grasped out, clutching 
with my mind. 

"Don't give up . . . we are coming . . ." 

It was her voice. The low, seductive voice of my dreams. But I 
didn't want to hear it now; this was 
the last thing I wanted to hear. 
This voice had brought me here, 
and I never wanted to hear it again. 

"No matter what the) say . . . 
no matter what they offer you or 
tell you . . . don't- give up." 

I fought it off. I drove it away 
by sheer mind-power. Either that or 
it stopped of itself. I didn't know 
and didn't care; all I wanted was 
peace and blackness again if I could 
find it. 

And then, after a while, I was 
awake, truly awake, and I knew 
this because I ached and burned 
all over. I could scarcely move. I 
lay on the tablelike thing and stared 
at the gleaming metal ceiling, not 
really seeing it. 

"How do you feel?" said somebody. 

I TURNED my head. The somebody was sitting beside me. He 
was a man of about fifty, thick-set 
and gray-haired with skin that 
looked like fine norcelain. His eyes 
were blue and^.ffiey seemed able, 
intelligent. He was not exactly 
smiling, but his expression was 
pleasant. Poised — that was the 



word. Here was a man who would 
quietly control things wherever he 
would go. 

I said, "Lousy. And you?" 

Ghost of a smile. "Sorry you had 
to go through it. We pick the Deacons because they're sadistically inclined. That makes for efficiency in 
the long run. Some people suffer, 
of course, but it's for the common 
good." 

I didn't say anything. If I had, 
it would have been insulting, unreasonable, blasphemous, obscene 
and treasonable. So I didn't say 
anylhing. I just kept staring at him. 

He continued to smile. "I'm 
N-J-K-F one seven seven three four 
nine, Chief of the Office of Psychological Adjustment. I'm usually 
simply Chief. I want you to consider me your friend — within the 
limits of State good, that is." 

I still didn't say anything. 

"Yours is quite a case, and of 
course I understand it. I think I 
had a quick insight into it the moment I spotted the arrest report on 
you. You're really lucky I happened 
to go through the arrest reports a 
little while ago, and got to you before the three Deacons who interviewed you returned. They were 
going to interview you some more." 
"Yes. I'm very lucky." My voice 
was flat, lifeless. 

' He leaned back easily in the 
chair. For all that he was thickset, he was graceful. He was handsome. His head, and deep, pleasant 
voice, and the cut of his porcelain 



100 




 



I, THE UNSPEAKABLE 



features all were handsome. Trust 
in me, said this handsomeness, I 
am a father to all men. 

"Naturally, we want to excuse 
your actions, and all the infractions 
you have committed in your rather 
desperate struggle for escape from 
your situation. Of course we'll have 
to re-evaluate your Emotional Adjustment Category. It must be very 
low by now. And I think I'll be 
able to assign a new name to you, 
and have it justify." 

Funny, here was the thing I'd 
sought and fought for, and now I 
had it, and this was the end of 
the long fight, and I didn't feel triumphant at all. I didn't even feel 
pleased. Funny. 

The chief said, "You can undoubtedly find a post suitable to a 
lower E.A.C. You can work your 
way up again. At least you'll be on 
productive status and have all the 
privileges that go with it." 

"Yes," I said. "Yes, I suppose 
so." 

"So there's really nothing to 
worry about now, is there?" 

"No, I suppose not." 

"There's just one little thing I'd 
like to go into before I take the 
steps necessary to get you on your 
feet again." Even his magnificent 
poise couldn't conceal the feather 
touch of slyness then. 

"One little thing?" I asked. 

THE pain was with me again. 
My body wasn't flesh; it was 
all raw, clinging pain. 



"We'll have to know who started 
you on your little quest. Who influenced you to try to have your 
name changed." 

I said, "I don't understand what 
you're talking about." 

He looked patient, smilingly patient. "It's rather obvious, you 
know. You wouldn't have acted as 
you did purely on your own impulses. I know that, because I cybed 
for your master file after I saw the 
report of arrest. Up until two days 
ago, your actions have always been 
satisfactorily conformal. A man 
doesn't change overnight like that 
without some sort of external influence." 

"But there wasn't any," I protested. "I mean, nobody told me to 
do anything. Nobody real." 

He chuckled. "Come now, you 
don't expect me to believe that, do 
you? After all, I deal with cases 
like this quite often. You're not 
the only one who has tried to upset 
the efficiency of the State. There's 
a pattern in these things, my friend. 
Almost invariably we find that a 
deliberate influence has gone to 
work on our infractor. There's a 
dangerous, organized underground 
movement that spends its time 
bringing these things about. One 
of its members unquestionably contacted you, suggested that you take 
the steps you have taken. Now, 
then, who was it?" 

"Nobody." I looked blank because I felt blank. 

The Chief sighed. "You've 



102 




 



changed more than I thought. Probably you're emotionally angry with 
the State now, after that little interview with the Deacons. That's understandable. But you'll have to 
come back to your senses. Let's put 
it this way, old man. // / don't get 
this information from you right 
now, the Deacons will." 

"Listen," I said, "what I'm telling you is the truth. There was nobody who told me to do anything. 
There was — well, there was a kind 
of voice that used to come into my 
dreams. A woman's voice. It suggested, in my dreams, that I go 
ahead and try to get my name 
changed. That's all." 

He wasn't smiling any more. "Do 
you really expect me to believe 
that?" 

"It's the truth, I tell you. It's the 
truth!" 

"Perhaps whoever influenced you 
did it subtly. Perhaps you never 
even realized it. Think back now. 
Who helped you? Who departed 
from standard and gave you any 
kind of aid?" 

Realization came like a cold wash. 
There had been help. Lara. She had 
gone out of her way back there in 
N. & I. She had been warm and 
real and she had dropped the mask 
of efficiency. Could it have been 
with a purpose? No matter. Guilty 
or innocent, if I mentioned her 
name, she would be interviewed. I 
didn't want that to happen to Lara. 
I shook my head and said, "No 
one helped me. I did it all my


self. You've got to believe that." 

"I don't," said the Chief, and got 
up. He looked at me for just a moment before he turned away. He 
said, "The boys will be able to have 
their fun, after all. I suppose it's 
just as well. It keeps their morale 
up to be able to interview somebody 
once in a while." 

"No! You can't! You can't send 
them in here again!" I shouted, 
without meaning to. I struggled to 
rise and found that I was strapped 
to the table. "No! No!" 

He was standing at the doorway 
to the room. He held a key-box 
oscillator in his hand- and I knew 
that a force screen held me in the 
cubicle here, and that without a keybox I could beat my head forever 
against that invisible barrier and 
never pass through that doorway. 
He said, "I'll give you one hour to 
decide. I'll be back. I'll ask you if 
you're ready to talk. If you aren't — 
well, you'll talk to the Deacons instead of me." 

The key-box hummed and he 
walked through the doorway and 
turned and disappeared. 

I stared after him and fought 
back my sudden nausea. 

V 

HOW long, then, lying there before a key-box hummed 
again? I didn't know. My time sense 
had been dulled. Even the pain was 
dull now; it was something that 
had always existed. 



I. THE UNSPEAKABLE 



103 



I looked at the shining ceiling. 

The glowlights began to dim and 
I supposed that since my arrest in 
the park another day had passed. 

Most of all, I wondered. Something had happened to me, something that I could almost feel as a 
physical change, but I didn't know 
quite what it was. I knew its results. I knew that I was no longer 
standard, no longer conformal, no 
longer well-behaved and moral and 
an efficient, useful citizen of the 
State. I hated the State. I hated all 
States. I hate all efficiency and common sense and hate. 

It suddenly came to me that I 
didn't care whether I was in 
Southern or Northern, or which of 
them ruled the world. 

I lay there. 

And presently a key-box hummed 
and I didn't even look that way. 
The stink of my own burning flesh 
still clung to my nostrils, the dull 
pain was still with me, but I didn't 
care. It was too much. When horror 
becomes too great, it stops being 
horror. The mind is smart. It 
doesn't believe; it doesn't register. 
The curve of sensation flattens out, 
stops, almost. 

When such horror looms, you go 
on doing whatever you are doing. 

I was lying there, so I went on 
lying there. 

"Don't speak," whispered a voice. 
"Don't ask questions." 

Something fumbled at the straps. 
I turned my head, and two people 
were in the room. They were thin. 



and their eyes were overlarge and 
they were naked and covered with 
bruises. The fugitives of the park 
last night! 

"What are you doing here?" 

Finger to the lips. That was the 
man. He was taking the straps from 
my legs. The woman was releasing 
my arms and shoulders. 

"But—" 

"Sh !" That was the woman. 

In a moment they had me free. I 
started, confidently, to rise, and the 
pain streaked through me like a 
powder rocket. They helped me. I 
stood there, amazed that I could 
stand. They helped me go forward. 
I took several dizzy steps, and after 
that it wasn't as bad. We moved 
through the doorway; there was no 
force screen. The man held the keybox. He pressed it as we moved 
away, to bring the force screen into 
place once more. 

I said, "Where are we — ?" 

I was shushed again. We went on 
through the corridors. Dead oyster 
white corridors. I walked as through 
a sea of marshmallow. Time sense 
was gone again and we were pushing on and on and there was no end 
in sight and we had already forgotten the beginning. 

We took an automatic shaft to 
another level and walked more corridors. 

ONCE we passed an opening and 
tunnelcars filled with people 
roared past. I had a flash glimpse of 
them. They sat there staring straight 



104 




 



ahead, wearing the efficient expressions of good workers. State corpses. 

Suddenly we emerged into the 
dark. It was the dark of night, but 
after the tunnels it was practically 
sunrise. The air was clean — no, it 
was not actually as clean as the conditioned air below. It was more than 
clean. It was dive. 

We were on the edge of a great 
concrete paved area. About a hundred yards ahead, a massive, shining, fat needle rose into the air, and 
squatted there against the stars. It 
was a spaceship in its launching 
cradle. There were low buildings 
near it, a few floodlights, and people standing around. It took a moment to realize that the men walking 
up and down and along the groups 
of people, the men with rifles on 
their shoulders, were guards. 

"Luck, now, that's all we need. A 
little luck," said the thin man beside 
me. It was the first time I had heard 
his voice. It was a low voice; he 
spoke with emotion. It was not approved standard. 

The woman moved beside him 
and put her hand upon his arm. 

I said, "May I talk now?" 

He turned to me, smiling. The 
smile had something of that sadness 
I had first noticed when he sat a 
prisoner in the jetcopter. "You want 
an explanation, don't you? Of 
course you do. But I'm afraid I can't 
tell you very much, except that we 
were sent to get you." 

"Sent? By whom? How did you 
have a key-box? And — " 



He laughed. "Wait, one question 
at a time. I was a force screen technician before — before we were arrested. Cells are the same everywhere. I know how to short the 
screens out from the inside; it's 
troublesome, but it can be done. 
That's how we escaped the first 
time. Then they discovered we were 
gone, chased us, and you gave us 
our second chance. We came here to 
the rendezvous. There were six here, 
including our elected leader. When 
we told the leader what had happened, she arranged for us to return, find you, and help you escape. 
It wasn't any problem to lift a keybox from the rack where they're 
usually kept.". 

I FELT as though I had been put 
upon the end of a huge oscillating spring. I said, "The leader? 
She?" 

"You'll meet her," he said. 
"After blastoff you'll meet her. 
Right now our problem is to slip in 
among those prisoners without being 
seen." 

"Among the prisoners}" 
"Haven't time to explain more. 
You'll have to trust us. Unless you 
want to stay here and have the 
Deacons hunt you till they find 
you." 

He was right: wherever I was 
going, I had to go. I couldn't go 
back now. Ever. I said, "I trust 
you. Let's go." 

Slipping in wasn't really difficult. 
There were only one or two guards 



I, THE UNSPEAKABLE 



10S 




for each group of prisoners, and 
they were looking for someone to 
escape, not join their flock. Some 
of the prisoners were dressed, some 
naked. Some looked bruised and 
beaten; some did not. It all depended on whether they had been 
questioned. They all looked dulleyed, resigned. They paid remarkably little attention as' we moved in 
among them, and stood there. 

THE guards began to call out orders presently and the groups 
shuffled forward, and then single 
lines moved up the ramp and into 
the spaceship. The thin man and his 
woman were still with me. "They 
don't bother to count," he whispered, "so we woij't be noticed." 

I wanted to' ask -him other questions, but we were divided into 
groups and they weren't in mine. 
Minutes later I found myself in 



the vast hull, sitting on one of the 
tiers that hold the seats vertical 
when the ship is tail-based for blastoff. It was very dim here and I 
couldn't readily make out the faces 
of the people on the same tier with 
me. 

A loudspeaker came to life; a 
deep, impersonal voice. "Fasten 
your webbings carefully!" 

I did that and heard the rustling 
sounds about me as the others did 
it, too. 

"Stand by for blastoff!" 

There was a dead pause, then a 
sudden low throbbing roar and the 
feeling of life in the floor plates 
and the bulkheads. I felt the slightest weight of pressure against the 
seat. The seat began to tilt slightly. 

Suddenly a soft voice on my left 
spoke: "We're on our way. They 
can't stop us now, can they?" 

It was the same low, provocative 


 



106 




THE UNSPEAKABLE 



woman's voice that I had heard in 
my dreams! 

I whirled my head. I could see 
only the shape of flowing hair, no 
features. "Who are you?" 

She laughed. "No wonder you 
don't recognize me. The natural 
voice is different than approved 
standard, isn't it? Listen. Do you 
remember this?" The 'head cocked 
to one side and a crisp, formal voice 
came out. "Information you desire 
is in Bank 29." 

"Lara!" I said. I pushed toward 
her, but the webbing held me back. 

"Yes. It's I. And we're together 
now and we'll have a long, long 
time to find out about each other. 
It's ten weeks to Mars." 

IRAN my hand over my forehead. "I don't get it. I don't get 
any of it. Your voice — I mean your 
real voice, not the standard one — I 
dreamed about it, and — " 

"I know." I could see her nod. 
"It wasn't a dream, though. I was 
talking to you. Each time. That was 
the way we planned it from the 
beginning." 

"Talking to me? But — but how? 
Through the sleep-learner?" 

"No, we'd never have been able 
to arrange that. It was through your 
identity tag, which would almost 
always be in contact with your skin 
when you slept. It has a microscopic 
electrical circuit, both between its 
metal halves and painted on its surface. The same principle as the 
sleep-learner, tactile induction, and, 



of course, a highly selective onechannel receiver. All I needed to do 
was put my transmitter on that same 
frequency." 

I shook my head. "I follow, I 
guess, but I'm still baffled. Why all 
this? When did—" 

"Wait for me to finish," she said. 
"We've been organized and underground, just as the Deacons suspect, 
for some time. One of our members 
worked on the identity tags and, 
when renumbering came about, it 
was a perfect opportunity to plant 
the receivers. We picked our people 
carefully. We picked doctors and 
hydroponic experts and chemists 
and rocket pilots — and we picked 
you because of your knowledge of 
space drive theory. Someday we'll 
go on to the stars; someday you'll 
help us do that. Anyway, all these 
people we have picked — or most of 
them — are joining us on Mars. 
There's where mankind will begin 
again while Northern and Southern 
sit upon earth and glare at each 
other across the equator and wait 
for war." 

"But Mars — there's an equator 
there, too." 

She laughed. "Northern and 
Southern prisoners there mingle all 
the time. There aren't enough 
guards to notice it, or stop it if they 
did notice it. There have even been 
hundreds of intermarriages." 

"Marriages? You mean like the 
pre-atomics ?" 

"Exactly. But we'll get to that 
later. We needed you for our 



108 




 



colony, only it wasn't likely that 
you'd infract all by yourself. You 
were too standard, too adjusted. We 
had to give you something to shake 
you out of it, to make you realize 
that the security of the State was 
not security, but slavery. And so 
one of our members in the renumbering bureau arranged for you to 
have that four letter word of yours 
for a name. One thing led to another, then, not always exactly as 
we'd planned it, but always in the 
same general direction. Our whole 
plan nearly failed when the 
Deacons nabbed you in the park. 
Fortunately, I'd come along to 
stow away on this trip, and I sent 
those others back after you." 

"But what if I'd actually managed to get my name changed?" 

THE ship was swaying now, 
balanced on its rocket trail. 
The acceleration was increasing. The 
seat was swinging back. The roar 
was becoming louder. 

"It was unlikely enough to take a 
chance on it. We felt at the veryleast you'd be kept on N/P status 
and then we could work on you 
some more until you infracted, and 
got sent to Marscol as a nonconform. Funny, that seems a terrible 
fate to most people. Actually, it's 
the only escape. From what I hear 
of Mars we'll like it there." 
I was recovering a little now and 



I dared to say, "If you're there, too, 
I'll like it. I know that." 

"Oh, you'll like other things. 
You'll like everything. And on 
Mars they'll call you by your present 
name if you wish, and no one will 
be at all shocked by it." There was 
a slight pause and then she said, 
"In fact, it's a very nice name. I — 
I wouldn't mind having it myself." 

"Is that what the pre-atomics 
called a proposal?" 

She laughed. "I'm not sure. But 
at least we have ten weeks to talk it 
over — " 

And then the acceleration pressed 
hard and the gray curtain began to 
come, and I knew that when it was 
lifted we would be on our way 
through space. I thought in that 
moment of the name that had 
brought all this about — the unspeakable four letter word that no conformist would ever dare voice, or 
even think of; the word, the dangerous word inimical to all that the 
warring, efficient State meant and 
stood for. 

The word, I realized, that eventually would destroy all that. 

I dared to say it now. I spelled 
it out first, and then I pronounced 
it. Just loud enough for Lara to 
hear above the growing roar. 
"L-O-V-E," I said. "Love." 

I heard Lara repeat it before the 
momentary blackout came.
