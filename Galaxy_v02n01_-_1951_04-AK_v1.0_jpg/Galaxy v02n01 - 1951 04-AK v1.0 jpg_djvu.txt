Treasurer's Report 



WITH this issue, we face 
the unfortunate fact that 
holding price lines is the 
responsibility of an entire economy 
and not just its individual entrepreneurs. 

GALAXY, like all business enterprises, and, in fact, all citizens, 
finds itself caught in an alarming 
tidal flood of rising costs. The 
problem can be solved in only one 
of two ways: 

• Cut expenses proportionately. In 
the case of GALAXY, that would 
mean reducing story rates, lowering 
the quality of cover and inside 
paper stock, going back to line engraving instead of the more costly 
halftone process, making it merely 
another science fiction magazine. 
Raise the price proportionately. 
This would allow us to retain all 
our features and continue to improve from issue to issue. 

Since it is impossible to get a 
readers' vote in time to cope with 
the immediate situation, we have 
chosen to raise the price, rather 
than compromise on quality. 

This is 710I, however, an inflexible decision. If your letters and 
our circulation figures show that 
you do not approve of this choice, 
we will change it. 

My own reluctance to tamper 
with quality is based partly on the 
contents of this issue, mostly on the 
excellent items coming up soon. 



and still more innovations planned. 

The present one introduces the 
policy of an issue of complete 
stories between serials. Of the six 
items, at least three probably will 
be selected for book publication — 
this has been the average for the 
previous issues of GALAXY, and 
bids are still coming in ! 

What would please us particularly would be the reprinting of 
every story in every issue; the publicity would be good for GALAXY 
and the additional income good for 
the writers. But that isn't likely. 
There isn't room enough for the 
number of anthologies needed to 
absorb the 60 or so stories we print 
a year. 

In the matter of novels, the picture is entirely different. Every 
book-length we have bought or contracted for has been signed for 
hard-cover publication. 

Next month's is Mars Child by 
Cyril Judd, three of the most compellingly convincing installments 
science fiction has ever produced. 
Cyril Judd, by the Way, is the joint 
name of C. M. Kornbluth and 
Judith Merril and was chosen only 
for wield iness, not secrecy. 

The cover is another superb 
Boncstell, reproduced magnificently 
on our splendid and very expensive 
Kromekote cover stock. 

Would you settle for less?

By FRITZ LEIBER 




NICE GIRL WITH 5 HUSBANDS 



Adventure is relative to one's previous experience. Sometimes, in fact, you can't even 
be sure you're having or not having one! 



TO BE given paid-up leisure 
and find yourself unable to 
create is unpleasant for any 
artist. To be stranded in a cluster 
of desert cabins with a dozen lonely people in the same predicament 
only makes it worse. So Tom Dorset was understandably irked with 
himself and the Tosker-Brown Vacation Fellowships as he climbed 
with the sun into the valley of red 
stones. He accepted the chafing of 
his camera strap against his shoulder as the nagging of conscience. 
He agreed with the disparaging 
hisses of the grains of sand rutched 
by his sneakers, and he wished that 
the occasional breezes, which faintly echoed the same criticisms, could 
blow him into a friendlier, less 
jealous age. 

He had no way of knowing that 
just as there are winds that blow 
through space, so there are winds 
that blow through time. Such 
winds may be strong or weak. The 
strong ones are rare and seldom 
blow for short distances, or more 
of us would know about them. 
What they pick up is almost always whirled far into the future or 
past. 

This has happened to people. 
There was Ambrose Bierce, who 



walked out of America and existence, and there are thousands of 
others who have disappeared without a trace, though many of these 
may not have been caught up by 
time tornadoes and I do not know 
if a time gale blew across the deck 
of the Marie Celeste. 

Sometimes a time wind is playful, snatching up an object, sporting with it for a season and then 
returning it unharmed to its original place. Sometimes we may be 
blown about by whimsical time 
winds without realizing it. Memory, 
for example, is a tiny time breeze, 
so weak that it can ripple only the 
mind. 

A very few time winds are like 
the monsoon, blowing at fixed intervals, first in one direction, then 
the other. Such a time wind blows 
near a balancing rock in a valley of 
red stones in the American Southwest. Every morning at ten 
o'clock, it blows a hundred years 
into the future; every afternoon at 
two, it blows a hundred years into 
the past. 

Quite a number of people have 
unwittingly seen time winds in operation. There are misty spots on 
the sea's horizon and wavery 
patches over desert sands. There 




 



are mirages and will o' the wisps 
and ice blinks. And there are dust 
devils, such as Tom Dorset walked 
into near the balancing rock. 

It seemed to him no more than 
a spiteful upgust of sand, against 
which he closed his eyes until the 
warm granules stopped peppering 
the lids. He opened them to see 
the balancing rock had silently 
fallen and lay a quarter buried — 
no, that couldn't be, he told himself instantly. He had been 
preoccupied; he must have passed 
the balancing rock and held its 
image in his mind. 

DESPITE this rationalization he 
was quite shaken. The strap of 
his camera slipped slowly down his 
arm without his feeling it. And 
just then there stepped around the 
giant bobbin of the rock an extraordinarily pretty girl with hair the 
same pinkish copper color. 

She was barefoot and wearing a 
pale blue playsuit rather like a 
Grecian tunic. But most important, 
as she stood there toeing his rough 
shadow in the sand, there was a 
complete naturalness about her, an 
absence of sharp edges, as if her 
personality had weathered without 
aging, just as the valley seemed to 
have taken another step toward 
eternity in the space of an instant. 

She must have assumed something of the same gentleness in him, 
for her faint surprise faded and 
she asked him, as easily as if he 
were a friend of five years' stand


ing, "Tell now, do you think a 
woman can love just one man? All 
her life? And a man just one woman?" 

Tom Dorset made a dazed 
sound. 

His mind searched wildly. 

"I do," she said, looking at him 
as calmly as at a mountain. "I think 
a man and woman can be each 
other's world, like Tristan and 
Isolde or Frederic and Catherine. 
Those old authors were wise. I 
don't see why on earth a girl has 
to spread her love around, no matter how enriching the experiences 
may be." 

"You know, I agree with you," 
Tom said, thinking he'd caught her 
idea — it was impossible not to 
catch her casualness. "I think 
there's something cheap about the 
way everybody's supposed to run 
after sex these days." 

"I don't mean that exactly. Tenderness is beautiful, but — " She 
pouted. "A big family can be vastly crushing. I wanted to declare 
today a holiday, but they outvoted 
me. Jock said it didn't chime with 
our mood cycles. But I was angry 
with them, so I put on my 
clothes — " 

"Put on — ?" . 

"To make it a holiday," she explained bafflingly. "And I walked 
here for a tantrum." She stepped 
out of Tom's shadow and hopped 
back. "Ow, the sand's getting hot," 
she said, rubbing the grains from 
the pale and uncramped toes. 



NICE GIRL WITH 5 HUSBANDS

"You go barefoot a lot?" Tom 
guessed. 

"No, mostly digitals," she replied and took something shimmering from a pocket at her hip 
and drew it on her foot. It was a 
high-ankled, transparent mocassin 
with five separate toes. She zipped 
it shut with the speed of a card 
trick, then similarly gloved the 
other foot. Again the metal-edged 
slit down the front seemed to close 
itself. 

"I'm behind on the fashions," 
Tom said, curious. They were 
walking side by side now, the way 
she'd come and he'd been going. 
"How does that zipper work?" 

"Magnetic. They're on all my 
clothes. Very simple." She parted 
her tunic to the waist, then let it 
zip together. 

"Clever," Tom remarked with a 
gulp. There seemed no limits to 
this girl's naturalness. 

"I see you're a button man," she 
said. "You actually believe it's possible for a man and woman to 
love just each other?" 

HIS chuckle was bitter. He was 
thinking of Elinore Murphy 
at Tosker-Brown and a bit about 
cold-faced Miss Tosker herself. "I 
sometimes wonder if it's possible 
for anyone to love anyone." 

"You haven't met the right 
girls," she said. 

"Girl," he corrected. 
She grinned at him. "You'll 
make me think you really are a 



monogamist. What group do you 
come from?" 

"Let's not talk about that," he 
requested. He was willing to forego knowing how she'd guessed he 
was from an art group, if he could 
be spared talking about the Vacation Fellowships and those nervous 
little cabins. 

"My group's very nice on the 
whole," the girl said, "but at times 
they can be nefandously exasperating. Jock's the worst, quietly guiding the rest of us like an analyst. 
How I loathe that man! But 
Larry's almost as bad, with his 
shame-faced bumptiousness, as if 
we'd all sneaked off on a joyride to 
Venus. And there's Jokichi at the 
opposite extreme, forever scared he 
won't distribute his affection equally, dividing it up into mean little 
packets like candy for jealous children who would scream if they got 
one chewy less. And then there's 
Sasha and Ernest — " 

"Who are you talking about?" 
Tom asked. 

"My husbands." She shook her 
head dolefully. "To find five more 
difficult men would be positively 
Martian." 

Tom's mind backtracked frantically, searching all conversations at 
Tosker-Brown for gossip about 
cultists in the neighborhood. It 
found nothing and embarked on a 
wider search. There were the Mormons (was that the word that had 
sounded like Martian?) but it 
wasn't the Mormon husbands who 



6 




 



were plural. And then there was 
Oneida (weren't husbands and 
wives both plural there?) but that 
was 19th century New England. 

"Five husbands?" he repeated. 
She nodded. He went on, "Do you 
mean to say five men have got you 
alone somewhere up here?" 

"To be sure not," she replied. 
"There are my kwives." 

"Kwives?" 

"Co-wives," she said more slowly. "They can be fascinerously exasperating, too." 

TOM'S mind did some more 
searching. "And yet you believe in monogamy?" 

She smiled. "Only when I'm having tantrums. It was civilized of 
you to agree with me." 

"But I actually do believe in 
monogamy," he protested. 

She gave his hand a little squeeze. 
"You are nice, but let's rush now. 
I've finished my tantrum and I want 
you to meet my group. You can 
fresh yourself with us." 

As they hurried across the heated 
sands, Tom Dorset felt for the first 
time a twinge of uneasiness. There 
was something about this girl, more 
than her strange clothes and the 
odd words she used now and then, 
something almost — though ghosts 
don't wear digitals — spectral. 

They scrambled up a little rise, 
digging their footgear into the 
sand, until they stood on a long 
flat. And there, serpentining around 
two great clumps of rock, was a 



many-windowed adobe ranch house 
with a roof like fresh soot. 

"Oh, they've put on their 
clothes," his companion exclaimed 
with pleasure. "They've decided to 
make it a holiday after all." 

Tom spotted a beard in the group 
swarming out to meet them. Its cultish look gave him a momentary 
feeling of superiority, followed by 
an equally momentary apprehension — the five husbands were certainly husky. Then both feelings 
were swallowed up in the swirl of 
introduction. 

He told his own name, found 
that his companion's was Lois 
Wolver, then smiling faces began 
to bob toward his, his hands were 
shaken, his cheeks were kissed, he 
was even spun around like blind 
man's buff, so that he lost track of 
the husbands and failed to attach 
Mary, Rachel, Simone and Joyce to 
the right owners. 

He did notice that Jokichi was 
an Oriental with a skin as tight as 
enameled china, and that Rachel 
was a tall slim Negro girl. Also 
someone said, "Joyce isn't a 
Wolver, she's just visiting." 

He got a much clearer impression 
of the clothes than the names. 
They were colorful, costly-looking, 
and mostly Egyptian and Cretan in 
inspiration. Some of them would 
have been quite immodest, even 
compared to Miss Tosker's famous 
playsuits, except that the wearers 
didn't seem to feel so. 

"There goes the middle-morning

rocket!" one of them eagerly cried. 

Tom looked up with the rest, 
but his eyes caught the dazzling 
sun. However, he heard a faint 
roaring that quickly sank in volume 
and pitch, and it reminded him 
that the Army had a rocket testing 
range in this area. He had little 
interest in science, but he hadn't 
known they were on a daily schedule. 

"Do you suppose it's off the 
track?" he asked anxiously. 

"Not a chance," someone told 
him — the beard, he thought. The 
assurance of the tones gave him 
a possible solution. Scientists came 
from all over the world these days 
and might have all sorts of advanced ideas. This could be a group 
working at a nearby atomic project 
and leading its peculiar private life 
on the side. 

AS THEY eddied toward the 
house he heard Lois remind 
someone, "But you finally did declare it a holiday," and a husband 
who looked like a gay pharaoh respond, "I had another see at the 
mood charts and I found a subtle 
surge I'd missed." 

Meanwhile the beard (a black 
one) had taken Tom in charge. 
Tom wasn't sure of his name, but 
he had a tan skin, a green sarong, 
and a fiercely jovial expression. 
"The swimming pool's around 
there, the landing spot's on the 
other side," he began, then noticed 
Tom gazing at the sooty roof. "Sun 



power cells," he explained proudly. "They store all the current we 

need." 

Tom felt his idea confirmed. 
"Wonder you don't use atomic 
power," he observed lightly. 

The beard nodded. "We've been 
asked that. Matter of esthetics. Why 
waste sunlight or use hard radiations needlessly? Of course, you 
might feel differently. What's your 
group, did you say?" 

"Tosker-Brown," Tom told him, 
adding when the beard frowned, 
"the Fellowship people, you know." 

"I don't," the beard confessed. 
"Where are you located?" 

Tom briefly described the ranch 
house and cabins at the other end 
of the valley. 

"Comic, I can't place it." The 
beard shrugged. "Here come the 
children." 

A dozen naked youngsters raced 
around the ranch house, followed 
by a woman in a vaguely African 
dress open down the sides. 

"Yours?" Tom asked. 

"Ours," the beard answered. 

"C'est un homme!" 

"Regardez des vetements!" 

"No need to practice, kids; this 
is a holiday," the beard told them. 
"Tom, Helen," he said, introducing 
the woman with the air-conditioned 
garment. "Her turn today to companion die Kinder." 

One of the latter rapped on the 
beard's knee. "May we show the 
stranger our things?" Instantly the 
others joined in pleading. The 



8 




 



beard shot an inquiring glance at 
Tom, who nodded. A moment later 
the small troupe was hurrying him 
toward a spacious lean-to at the 
end of the ranch house. It was 
chuckful of strange toys, rocks and 
plants, small animals in cages and 
out, and the oddest model airplanes, 
or submarines. But Tom was given 
no time to look at any one thing 
for long. 

"See my crystals? I grew them." 

"Smell my mutated gardenias. 
Tell now, isn't there a difference?" 
There didn't seem to be, but he 
nodded. 

"Look at my squabbits." This referred to some long-eared white 
squirrels nibbling carrots and nuts. 

"Here's my newest model spaceship, a DS-57-B. Notice the detail." 
The oldest boy shoved one of the 
submarine affairs in his face. 

rDM felt like a figure that is being tugged about in a rococo 
painting by wide pink ribbons in 
the chubby hands of naked cherubs. Except that these cherubs were 
slim and tanned, fantastically energetic, and apparently of depressingly high IQ. (What these 
scientists did to children!) He 
missed Lois and was grateful for 
the single little girl solemnly skipping rope in a corner and paying 
no attention to him. 

The odd lingo she repeated stuck 
in his mind: "Gik-lo, I-o, Rik-o, 
Gis-so. Gik-lo, I-o . . ." 

Suddenly the air was filled 



with soft chimes. "Lunch," the 
children shouted and ran away. 

Tom followed at a soberer pace 
along the wall of the ranch house. 
He glanced in the huge windows, 
curious about the living and sleeping arrangements of the Wolvers, 
but the panes were strangely darkened. Then he entered the wide 
doorway through which the children had scampered and his curiosity turned to wonder. 

A resilient green floor that 
wasn't flat, but sloped up toward 
the white of the far wall like a 
breaking wave. Chairs like giants' 
hands tenderly cupped. Little tables 
growing like mushrooms and broadleafed plants out of the green floor. 
A vast picture window showing the 
red rocks. 

Yet it was the wood-paneled 
walls that electrified his artistic interest. They blossomed with fruits 
and flowers, deep and poignantly 
carved in several styles. He had 
never seen such work. 

He became aware of a silence 
and realized that his hosts and hostesses were smiling at him from 
around a long table. Moved by a 
sudden humility, he knelt and unlaced his sneakers and added them 
to the pile of sandals and digitals 
by the door. As he rose, a soft and 
comic piping started and he realized that beyond the table the children were lined up, solemnly 
puffing at little wooden flutes and 
recorders. He saw the empty chair 
at the table and went toward it,

conscious for the moment of noth- food reminded him that he was 

ing but his dusty feet. hungry. There was a charming little 

He was disappointed that Lois steak, striped black and brown with

tables and fruits, one or two of 
which he didn't recognize. 

"Flown from Africa," someone 
explained to him. 



These sly scientists, he thought, 
living behind their security curtain 
in the most improbable world! 

When they were sitting with 
coffee and wine, and the children 
had finished their concert and were 
busy at another table, he asked, 
"How do you manage all this?" 

Jock, the gay pharaoh, shrugged. 
"It's not difficult." 

Rachel, the slim Negro, chuckled 
in her throat. "We're just people, 
Tom." 

He tried to phrase his question 
without mentioning money. "What 
do you all do?" 

"Jock's a uranium miner," Larry 




NICE GIRL WITH 5 HUSBANDS 




(the beard) answered, briskly taking over. "Rachel's an algae farmer. 
I'm a rocket pilot. Lois — " 

ALTHOUGH pleased at this 
final confirmation of his guess, 
Tom couldn't help feeling a surge 
of uneasiness. "Sure you should be 
telling me these things?" 

Larry laughed. "Why not? Lois 
and Jokichi have been exchangeworkers in China the last six 
months." 

"Mostly digging ditches," Jokichi put in with a smile. 

" — and Sasha's in an assembly 
plant. Helen's a psychiatrist. Oh, 
we just do ordinary things. Now 
we're on grand vacation." 
"Grand vacation?" 
"When all of us have a vacation 
together," Larry explained. "What 
do you do?" 

"I'm an artist," Tom said, taking out a cigaret. 

"But what else?" Larry asked. 
Tom felt an angry embarrass- . 
ment. "Just an artist," he mumbled, 
cigaret in mouth, digging in his 
pockets for a match. 

"Hold on," said Joyce beside him 
and pointed a silver pencil at the 
tip of the cigaret. He felt a faint 
thrill in his lips and then started 
back, coughing. The cigaret was 
lighted. 

"Please mutate my poppy seeds, 
Mommy." A little girl had darted 
to Joyce from the children's 
table. 

"You're a very dirty little girl," 



Joyce told her without reproof. 
"Hold them out." She briefly directed the silver pencil at the clay 
pellets on the grimy little palm. The 
little girl shivered delightedly. "I 
love ultrasonics, they feel so 
funny." She scampered off. 

Tom cleared his throat. "I must 
say I'm tremendously impressed 
with the wood carvings. I'd like to 
photograph them. Oh, Lord!" 

"What's the matter?" Rachel 
asked. 

"I lost my camera somewhere." 
"Camera?" Jokichi showed interest. "You mean one for stills?" 
"Yes." 

"What kind?" 

"A Leica," Tom told him. 

Jokichi seemed impressed. "That 
is interesting. I've never seen one 
of those old ones." 

"Tom's a button man," Lois remarked by way of explanation, apparently. "Was the camera in a 
brown case? You dropped it where 
we met. We can get it later." 

"Good, I'd really like to take 
those pictures," Tom said. "Incidentally, who did the carvings?" 

"We did," Jock said. "Together." 

Tom was grateful that the scamper of the children out of the room 
saved him from having to reply. 
He couldn't think of anything but 
a grunt of astonishment. 

The conversation split into a > 
group of chats about something 
called a psych machine, trips to 
Russia, the planet Mars, and sev

eral artists Tom had never heard of. 
He wanted to talk to Lois, but she 
was one of the group gabbling 
about Mars like children. He felt 
suddenly uneasy and out of things, 
and neither Rachel's deprecating 
remarks about her section of the 
wood carvings nor Joyce's interesting smiles helped much. He was 
glad when they all began to get 
up. He wandered outside and made 
his way to the childrens' lean-to, 
feeling very depressed. 

ONCE again he was the center 
of a friendly naked cluster, 
except for the same solemn-faced 
little girl skipping rope. A rather 
malicious but not very hopeful 
whim prompted him to ask the 
youngest, "What's one and one?" 

"Ten," the shaver answered glibly. Tom felt pleased. 

"It could also be two," the oldest boy remarked. 

"I'll say," Tom agreed. "What's 
the population of the world?" 
"About seven hundred million." 
Tom nodded noncommittally and, 
grabbing at the first long word 
that he thought of, turned to the 
eldest girl. "What's poliomyelitis?" 
"Never heard of it," she said. 
The solemn little girl kept 
droning the same ridiculous chant: 
"Gik-lo, I-o, Rik-o, Gis-so." 

His ego eased, Tom went outside and there was Lois. 

"What's the matter?" she asked. 

"Nothing," he said. 

She took his hand. "Have we 



pushed ourselves at you too much? 
Has our jabbering bothered you? 
We're a loud-mouthed family and 
I didn't think to ask if you were 
loning." 

"Loning?" 

"Solituding." 

"In a way," he said. They didn't 
speak for a moment. Then, "Are 
you happy, Lois, in your life here ?" 
he asked. 

Her smile was instant. "Of 
course. Don't you like my 
group?" 

He hesitated. "They make me 
feel rather no good," he said, and 
then admitted, "but in a way I'm 
more attracted to them than any 
people I've ever met." 

"You are?" Her grip on his hand 
lightened. "Then why don't you 
stay with us for a while? I like 
you. It's too early to propose anything, but I think you have a quality our group lacks. You could see 
how you fit in. And there's Joyce. 
She's just visiting, too. You 
wouldn't have to lone unless you 
wanted." 

Before he could think, there was 
a rhythmic rush of feet and the 
Wolvers were around them. 

"We're swimming," Simone announced. 

Lois looked at Tom inquiringly. 
He smiled his willingness, started 
to mention he didn't have trunks, 
then realized that wouldn't be news 
here. He wondered whether he 
would blush. 

Jock fell in beside him as they

rounded the ranch house. "Larry's 
been telling me about your group 
at the other end of the valley. It's 
comic, but I've whirled down the 
valley a dozen times and never 
spotted any sort of place there. 
What's it like?" 

"A ranch house and several cabins." 

JOCK frowned. "Comic I never 
saw it." His face cleared. "How 
about whirling over there? You 
could point it out to me." 

"It's really there," Tom said uneasily. "I'm not making it up." 

"Of course," Jock assured him. 
"It was just an idea." 

"We could pick up your camera 
on the way," Lois put in. 

The rest of the group had turned 
back from the huge oval pool and 
the dark blue and flashing thing 
beyond it, and stood gay-colored 
against the pool's pale blue shimmer. 

"How about it?" Jock asked 
them. "A whirl before we bathe?" 

Two or three said yes besides 
Lois, and Jock led the way toward 
the helicopter that Tom now saw 
standing beyond the pool, its beetle 
body as blue as a scarab, its vanes 
flashing silver. 

The others piled in. Tom followed as casually as he could, trying to suppress the pounding of his 
heart. "Wonder you don't go by 
rocket," he remarked lightly. 

Jock laughed. "For such a short 
trip?" 



The vanes began to thrum. Tom 
sat stiffly, gripping the sides of the 
seat, then realized that the others 
had sunk back lazily in the cushions. There was a moment of strain 
and they were falling ahead and 
up. Looking out the side, Tom saw 
for a moment the sooty roof of the 
ranch house and the blue of the 
pool and the pinkish umber of 
tanned bodies. Then the helicopter 
lurched gently around. Without 
warning a miserable uneasiness 
gripped him, a desire to cling 
mixed with an urge to escape. He 
tried to convince himself it was 
fear of the height. 

He heard Lois tell Jock, "That's 
the place, down by that rock that 
looks like a wrecked spaceship." 

The helicopter began to fall forward. Tom felt Lois' hand on his. 

"You haven't answered my question," she said. 

"What?" he asked dully. 

"Whether you'll stay with us. At 
least for a while." 

He looked at her. Her smile was 
a comfort. He said, "If I possibly 
can." 

"What could possibly stop you?" 

"I don't know," he answered abstractedly. 

"You're strange," Lois told him. 
"There's a weight of sadness in 
you. As if you lived in a less happy 
age. As if it weren't 2050." 

"Twenty?" he repeated, awakening from his thoughts with a jerk. 
"What's the time?" he asked anxiously. 



14 




 



"Two," Jock said. The word 
sounded like a knell. 

"You need cheering," Lois announced firmly. 

Amid a whoosh of air rebounding from earth, they jounced gently 
down. Lois vaulted out. "Come on," 
she said. 

Tom followed her. "Where?" he 
asked stupidly, looking around at 
the red rocks through the settling 
sand cloud stirred by the vanes. 

"Your camera," she told him, 
laughing. "Over there. Come on, 
I'll race you." 

He started to run with her and 
then his uneasiness got beyond his 
control. He ran faster and faster. 
He saw Lois catch her foot on a 
rock and go down sprawling, but 
he couldn't stop. He ran desperately around the rock and into a 
gust of up-whirling sand that terrified him with its suddenness. He 
tried to escape from the stinging; 
blinding gust, but there was the 
nightmarish fright that his wild 
strides were carrying him nowhere. 

Then the sand settled. He 
stopped running and looked around 
him. He was standing by the balancing rock. He was gasping. At 
his feet the rusty brown leather of 
the camera case peeped from the 
sand. Lois was nowhere in sight. 
Neither was the helicopter. The 
valley seemed different, rawer — 
one might almost have said younger. 



Hours after dark he trailed into 
Tosker-Brown. Curtained lights still 
glowed from a few cabins. He was 
footsore, bewildered, frightened. 
All afternoon and through the twilight and into the moonlit evening 
that turned the red rocks black, he 
had searched the valley. Nowhere 
had he been able to find the sootroofed ranch house of the Wolvers. 
He hadn't even been able to locate 
the rock like a giant bobbin where 
he'd met Lois. 

During the next days he often 
returned to the valley. But he never 
found anything. And he never happened to be near the balancing rock 
when the time winds blew at ten 
and two, though once or twice he 
did see dust devils. Then he went 
away and eventually forgot. 

In his casual reading he ran 
across popular science articles describing the binary system of numbers used in electronic calculating 
machines, where one and one make 
ten. He always skipped them. And 
more than once he saw the four 
equations expressing Einstein's generalized theory of gravitation: 

He never connected them with 
the little girl's chant: "Gik-lo, I-o, 
Rik-o, Gis-so."

INSIDE EARTH 




By POUL ANDERSON 



Obviously, no conqueror wants his subjects to 
revolt against his rule. Obviously? This one 
would go to any lengths to start a rebellion!

Illustrated by DAVID STONE 



I 

THE biotechnicians had been 
very thorough. I was already a little undersized, 
which meant that my height and 



build were suitable — I could pass 
for a big Earthling. And of course 
my face and hands and so on were 
all right, the Earthlings being a 
remarkably humanoid race. But the 
technicians had had to remodel my 



INSIDE EARTH 



17 



ears, blunting the tips and grafting 
on lobes and cutting the muscles 
that move them. My crest had to go 
and a scalp covered with revolting 
hair was now on the top of my 
skull. 

Finally, and most difficult, there 
had been the matter of skin color. 
It just wasn't possible to eliminate 
my natural coppery pigmentation. 
So they had injected a substance 
akin to melanin, together with a 
virus which would manufacture it 
in my body, the result being a 
leathery brown. I could pass for a 
member of the so-called "white'* 
subspecies, one who had spent most 
of his life in the open. 

The mimicry was perfect. I 
hardly recognized the creature that 
looked out of the mirror. My lean, 
square, blunt-nosed face, gray eyes, 
and big hands were the same or 
nearly so. But my black crest had 
been replaced with a shock of blond 
hair, my ears were small and immobile, my skin a dull bronze, and 
several of Earth's languages were 
hypnotically implanted in my brain 
— together with a set of habits and 
reflexes making up a pseudo-personality which should be immune to 
any tests that the rebels could think 
of. 

I was Earthling! And the disguise was self-perpetuating: the 
hair grew and the skin color was 
kept permanent by the artificial 
"disease." The biotechnicians had 
told me that if I kept the disguise 
long enough, till I began to age — 



say, in a century or so — the hair 
would actually thin and turn white 
as it did with the natives. 

It was reassuring to think that 
once my job was over, I could be 
restored to normal. It would need 
another series of operations and as 
much time as the original transformation, but it would be as complete and scarless. I'd be human 
again. 

I put on the clothes they had 
furnished me, typical Earthly garments — rough trousers and shirt of 
bleached plant fibers, jacket and 
heavy shoes of animal skin, a battered old hat of matted fur known 
as felt. There were objects in my 
pockets, the usual money and 
papers, a claspknife, the pipe and 
tobacco I had trained myself to 
smoke and even to like. It all fitted 
into my character of a wandering, 
outdoors sort of man, an educated 
atavist. 

I went out of the hospital with 
the long swinging stride of one 
accustomed to walking great distances. 

THE Center was busy around me. 
Behind me, the hospital and 
laboratories occupied a fairly small 
building, some eighty stories of 
stone and steel and plastic. On 
either side loomed the great warehouses, military barracks, officers' 
apartments, civilian concessions, 
filled with the vigorous life of the 
starways. Behind the monstrous 
wall, a mile to my right, was the 



18 




 



spaceport, and I knew that a troopship had just lately dropped gravs 
from Valgolia herself. 

The Center swarmed with young 
recruits off duty, gaping at the 
sights, swaggering in their new 
uniforms. Their skins shone like 
polished copper in the blistering 
sunlight, and their crests were beginning to wilt a little. All Earth 
is not the tropical jungle most Valgolians think it is — northern 
Europe is very pleasant, and Greenland is even a little on the cold 
side — but it gets hot enough at 
North America Center in midsummer to fry a shilast. 

A cosmopolitan throng filled the 
walkways. Soldiers predominated — • 
huge, shy Dacors, little slant-eyed 
Yangtusans, brawling Gorrads, all 
the manhood of Valgolia. Then 
there were other races, blue-skinned 
Vegans, furry Proximans, completely non-humanoid Sirians and Antarians. They were here as traders, 
observers, tourists, whatever else of 
a non-military nature one can 
imagine. 

I made an absent-minded way 
through the crowds. A sudden 
crack on the side of my head, nearly bowling me over, brought me to 
awareness. I looked up into the 
arrogant face of one of the new 
recruits and heard him rasp, 
"Watch where you're going, 
Terrie!" 

The young blood in the Valgolian military is deliberately trained 
to harshness, even brutality, for 



our militarism must impress such 
backward colonies as Earth. It goes 
against our grain, but it is necessary. At another time this might 
have annoyed me. I could have 
pulled rank on him. Not only was 
I an officer, but such treatment 
must be used with intellectual deliberation. The occasional young 
garrison trooper who comes here 
with the idea that the natives are 
an inferior breed to be kicked 
around misses the whole point of 
Empire. If, indeed, Earth's millions 
were an inferior breed, I wouldn't 
have been here at all. Valgol needs 
an economic empire, but if all we 
had in mind was serfdom we'd be 
perfectly content with the plodding 
animal life of Deneb VII or a hundred other worlds. 

I cringed appropriately, as if I 
didn't understand Valgolian Universal, and slunk past him. But it 
griped me to be taken for a Terrie. 
If I was to become an Earthling, 
I would at least be a self-respecting 
one. 

THERE were plenty of Terries — 
Terrestrials — around, of course, 
moving with their odd combination 
of slavish deference toward Valgolians and arrogant superiority 
toward mere Earthlings. They have 
adopted the habits and customs of 
civilization, entered the Imperial 
service, speak Valgolian even with 
their families. Many of them shave 
their heads save for a scalp lock, 
in imitation of the crest, and wear 



INSIDE EARTH 



19 



white robes suggesting those of 
■civil functionaries at home. 

I've always felt a little sorry for 
the class. They work, and study, 
and toady to us, and try so hard 
to be like us. It's frustrating, because that's exactly what we don't 
want. Valgolians are Valgolians 
and Earthlings are men of Earth. 
Well, Terries are important to the 
ultimate aims of the Empire, but 
not in the way they think they are. 
They serve as another symbol of 
Valgolian conquest for Earth to 
hate. 

I entered the Administration 
Building. They expected me there 
and took me at once to the office of 
General Vorka, who's a general 
only as far as this solar system is 
concerned. Had there been any 
Earthlings around, I would have 
saluted to conform to the show of 
militarism, but General Vorka sat 
alone behind his desk, and I merely said, "Hello, Coordinator." 

The sleeves of his tunic rolled 
up, the heat of North America 
beading his forehead with sweat, 
the big man looked up at me. "Ah, 
yes. I'm glad you're finally prepared. The sooner we get this thing 
started — " He extended a silver 
galla-dust box. "Sniff? Have a seat, 
Conru." 

I inhaled gratefully and relaxed. 
The Coordinator picked up a sheaf 
of papers on his desk and leafed 
through them. "Umm-mm, only 
fifty-two years old and a captain 
already. Remarkably able, a young 




20 




 



if 



man like you. And your work 
hitherto has been outstanding. That 
Vegan business . . ." 

I said yes, I knew, but could he 
please get down to business. You 
couldn't blame me for being a bit 
anxious to begin. Disguised as I 
was as an Earthman, I felt uncomfortable, embarrassed, almost, at 
being with my ex-countrymen. 

The Coordinator shrugged. 
"Well, if you can carry this business off — fine. If you fail, you may 
die quite unpleasantly. That's their 
trouble, Conru: you wouldn't be 
regarded as an individual, but as 
a Valgolian. Did you know that 
they even make such distinctions 
among themselves? I mean races 



ana sub-races and social castes and 
the like; it's keeping them divided 
and impotent, Conru. It's also keeping them out of the Empire. A 
shame." 

I KNEW all that, of course, but 
I merely nodded. Coordinator 
Vorka was a wonderful man in his 
field, and if he tended to be on 
the garrulous side, what could I 
do? I said, "I know that, sir. I also 
know I was picked for a dangerous 
job because you thought I could 
fill the role. But I still don't know 
exactly what the job is." 

Coordinator Vorka smiled. "I'm 
afraid I can't tell you much more 
than you must already have 



INSIDE EARTH 



21 



guessed," he said. "The anarch 
movement here — the rebels, that 
is — is getting no place, primarily 
because of internal difficulties. 
When members of the same group 
spit epithets at each other referring to what they consider racial 
or national distinctions which determine superiority or inferiority, 
the group is bound to be an insecure one. Such insecurity just does 
not make for a strong rebellion, 
Conru. They try, and we goad 
them — but dissention splits them 
constantly and their revolutions 
fizzle out. 

"They just can't unite against 
us, can't unite at all. Conru, you 
know how we've tried to educate 
them. It's worked, too, to some 
extent. But you can't educate three 
billion people who have a whole 
cultural pattern behind them." 

I winced. "Three billion?" 

"Certainly. Earth is a rich planet, 
Conru, and a fairly crowded one 
at the same time. Bickering is inevitable. It's a part of their culture, 
as much as cooperation has been 
a part of ours." 

I nodded. "We learned the hard 
way. The old Valgol was a poor 
planet and we had to unite to conquer space or we could not have 
survived." 

The Coordinator sniffed again 
at his silver box. "Of course. And 
we're trying to help these people 
unite. They don't have to make the 
same mistakes we did, long ago. 
They don't have to at all. Get them 



to hate us enough, get them to 
hate us until all their own clannish 
hatreds don't count at all . . . Well, 
you know what happened on Samtrak." 

I knew. The Samtraks are now 
the entrepreneurs of the Empire, 
really ingenious traders, but within 
the memory of some of our older 
men they were a sore-spot. They 
didn't understand the meaning of 
Empire any more than Earth does, 
and they never did understand it 
until we goaded- them into open 
rebellion. The very reverse of divide and rule, you might say, and 
it worked. We withdrew trading 
privileges one by one, until they 
revolted successfully, thus educating themselves sociologically in only 
a few generations. 

VORKA said, "The problem of 
Earth is not quite that 
simple." He leaned back, made a 
bridge of his fingers, and peered 
across them at me. "Do you know 
precisely what a provocateur job is, 
Conru?" 

I said that I did, but only in a 
hazy way, because until now my 
work had been pretty much restricted to social relations on the more 
advanced Empire planets. However, 
I told him that I did know the idea 
was to provoke discontent and, 
ultimately, rebellion. 

The Coordinator smiled. "Well, 
that's just the starter, Conru. It's a 
lot more complex than that. Each 
planet has its own special problems. 



22 




 



The Samtraks, for example, had a 
whole background of cutthroat competition. That was easy: we eliminated that by showing them what 
real cutthroat competition could be 
like. But Earth is different. Look at 
it this way. They fight among 
themselves. Because of their mythical distinctions, not realizing that 
there are no inferior races, only 
more or less advanced ones, and 
that individuals must be judged as 
individuals, not as members of 
groups, nations or races. A planet 
like Earth can be immensely valuable to the Empire, but not if it 
has to be garrisoned. Its contribution must be voluntary and wholehearted." 

"A difficult problem," I said. 
"My opinion is that we should treat 
all exactly alike — force them to 
abandon their unrealistic differences." 

"Exactly!" The Coordinator 
seemed pleased, but, actually, this 
was pretty elementary stuff. "We're 
never too rough on the eager lads 
who come here from Valgol and 
kick the natives around a bit. We 
even encourage it when the spirit 
of rebelliousness dies down." 

I told him I had met one. 

"Irritating, wasn't it, Conru? 
Humiliating. Of course, these lads 
will be reconditioned to civilization when they finish their military 
service and prepare for more specialized work. Yes, treating all 
Earthlings alike is the solution. We 
put restrictions on these colonials; 



they can't hold top jobs, and so 
on. And we encourage wild storie. 
about brutality on our part. No: 
enough to make everybody mad a: 
us, or even a majority — the rumored tyranny has always happened 
to someone else. But there's a certain class of beings who'll get fighting mad, and that's the class we 
want." 

"The leaders," I chimed in. 
"The idealists. Brave, intelligent 
patriotic. The kind who probably 
wouldn't be a part of this racial 
bickering, anyway." 

"Right," said the Coordinator. 
"We'll give them the ammunition 
"for their propaganda. We've been 
doing it. Result: the leaders get 
mad. Races, religions, nationalities, 
they hate us worse than they hate 
each other." 

THE way he painted it, I was 
hardly needed at all. I told 
him that. " 

"Ideally, that would be the situation, Conru. Only it doesn't 
work that way." He took out a 
soft cloth and wiped his forehead. 
"Even the leaders are too involved 
in this myth of differences and 
they can't concentrate all their 
efforts. Luron, of course, would be 
the other alternative — " 

That was a very logical statement, but sometimes logic has a 
way of making you laugh, and I 
was laughing now. Luron considered itself our arch-enemy. With a 
few dozen allies on a path of con


INSIDE EARTH 



23 



quest, Luron thought it could wrest 
Empire from our hands. Well, we 
let them play. And each time Luron 
swooped down on one of the more 
primitive planets, we let them, for 
Luron would serve as well as ourselves in goading backward peoples 
to unite and advance. Perhaps 
Luron, as a social entity, grew wiser 
each time. Certainly the primitive 
colonials did. Luron had started a 
chain reaction which threatened to 
overthrow the tyranny of superstition on a hundred planets. Good 
old Luron, our arch-enemy, would 
see the light itself some day. 

The Coordinator shook his head. 
"Can't use Luron here. Technologies are entirely too similar. It 
might shatter both planets, and we 
wouldn't want that." 

"So what do we use?" 

"You, Conru. You get in with 
the revolutionaries, you make sure 
that they want to fight, you — " 

"I see," I told him. "Then I try 
to stop it at the last minute. Not 
so soon that the rebellion doesn't 
help at all — " 

The Coordinator put his hand 
down flat. "Nothing of the sort. 
They must fight. And they must 
be defeated, again and again, if 
necessary, until they are ready to 
succeed. That will be, of course, 
when they are totally against us." 

I stood up. "I understand." 

He waved me back into the chair. 
"You'll be lucky to understand it 
by the time you're finished with 
this assignment and transferred to 



another . . . that is, if you come 
out of this one alive." 

I smiled a bit sheepishly and 
told him to go ahead. 

"We have some influence in the 
underground movement, as you 
might logically expect. The leader 
is a man we worked very hard to 
have elected." 

"A member of one of the despised races?" I guessed. 

"The best we could do at this 
point was to help elect someone 
from a minority sub-group of the 
dominant white race. The leader's 
name is Levinsohn. He is of the 
white sub-group known as Jews." 

"TTOW well is this Levinsohn 
-L.-L accepted by the movement?" 

"Considerable resistance and 
hostility," the Coordinator said. 
"That's to be expected. However, 
we've made sure that there is no 
other organization the minorityhaters can join, so they have to 
follow him or quit. He's able, all 
right; one of the most able men 
they have, which helps our aims. 
Even those who discriminate 
against Jews reluctantly admire 
him. He's moved the headquarters 
of the movement out into space, 
and the man's so brilliant that we 
don't even know where. We'll find 
out, mainly through you, I hope, 
but that isn't the important thing." 

"What is?" I asked, baffled. 

"To report on the unification of 
Earth. It's possible that the anarch 



24 




 



movement can achieve it under Levinsohn. In that case, we'll make 
sure they win, or think they win, 
and will gladly sign a treaty giving 
Earth equal planetary status in the 
Empire." 

"And if unity hasn't been 
achieved?" 

"We simply crush this rebellion 
and make them start all over again. 
They'll have learned some degree 
of unity from this revolt and so 
the next one will be more successful." He stood up and I got out 
of my chair to face him. "That's 
for the future, though. We'll work 
out our plans from the results of 
this campaign." 

"But isn't there a lot of danger 
in the policy of fomenting rebellion against us?" I asked. 

He lifted his shoulders. "Evolution is always painful, forced evolution even more so. Yes, there are 
great dangers, but advance information from you and other agents can 
reduce the risk. It's a chance we 
must take, Conru." 

"Conrad," I corrected him, smiling. "Plain Mr. Conrad Haugen 
. . . of Earth." 

II 

A FEW days later, I left North 
America Center, and in spite 
of the ominous need to hurry, my 
eastward journey was a ramble. The 
anarchs would be sure to check my 
movements as far back as they 
could, and my story had better ring 



true. For the present, I must be my 
role, a vagabond. 

The city was soon behind me. It 
was far from other settlement — it 
is good policy to keep the Centers 
rather isolated, and we could always contact our garrisons in native 
towns quickly enough. Before long 
I was alone in the mountains. 

I liked that part of the trip. The 
Rockies are huge and serene, a 
fresh cold wind blows from their 
peaks and roars in the pines, brawling rivers foam through their dales 
and canyons — it is a big landscape, 
clean and strong and lonely. It 
speaks with silence. 

I hitched a ride for some hundreds of miles with one of the great 
truck-trains that dominate the western highways. The driver was Earthling, and though he complained 
much about the Valgolian tyranny 
he looked well-fed, healthy, secure. 
I thought of the wars which had 
been laying the planet waste, the 
social ruin and economic collapse 
which the Empire had mended, and 
wondered if Terra would ever be 
fit to "rule itself. 

I came out of the enormous 
mountainlands into the sage plains 
of Nevada. For a few days I worked 
at a native ranch, listening to the 
talk and keeping my mouth shut. 
Yes, there was discontent ! 
. "Their taxes are killing me," said 
the owner. "What the hell incentive 
do I have to produce if they take 
it away from me?" I nodded, but 
thought: Your kind was paying 



INSIDE EARTH 



25 



more taxes in the old days, and had 
less to show for it. Here you get 
your money back in public works 
and universal security. No one on 
Earth is cold or hungry. Can you 
only produce for your own private 
gain, Earthling? 

"The labor draft got my kid the 
other day," said the foreman. 
"He'll spend two good years of his 
life working for them, and prob'ly 
come back hopheaded about the 
good o' the Empire." 

There was a time, I thought, 
when millions of Earthlings clamored for work, or spent years fighting their wars, gave their youth to 
i god of battle who only clamored 
for more blood. And how can we 
have a stable society without educating its members to respect it? 

"I want another kid," said the female cook. "Two ain't really 
enough. They're good boys, but I 
want a girl too. Only the Eridanian 
law says if I go over my quota, if 
I have one more, they'll sterilize 
me ! And they'd do it, the meddling 
devils." 

A billion Earthlings are all the 
Solar System can hold under decent standards of living without 
exhausting what natural resources 
their own culture left us, I thought. 
W e aren't ready to permit emigration; our own people must come 
first. But these beings can live ivell 
here. Only now that we've eliminated famine, plague, and war, they'd 
breed beyond reason, breed till all 
the old evils came back to throttle 



them, if we didn't have strict population control. 

"T7-EAH," said her husband 
-L bitterly. "They never even 
let my cousin have kids. Sterilized 
him damn near right after he was 
born." 

Then he's a moron, or carries 
hemophilia, or has some other 
hereditary taint, I thought. Can't 
they see we're doing it for their 
own good? It costs us fantastically 
in money and trouble, but the goal 
is a level of health and sanity such 
as this race never in its history 
dreamed possible. 

"They're stranglin' faith," muttered someone else. 

Anyone in the Empire may worship as he chooses, but should permission be granted to preach 
demonstrable falsehoods, archaic 
superstitions, or antisocial nonsense? The old "free" Earth was 
not noted for liberalism. 

"We want to be free." 

Free? Free for what? To loose 
the thousand Earthly races and 
creeds and nationalisms on each 
other — and on the Galaxy — to wallow in barbarism and slaughter 
and misery as before we came? To 
let our works and culture be 
thrown in the dust, the labor of a 
century be demolished, not because 
it is good or bad but simply because it is Valgolian? Epsilon Eridanian! 

"We'll be free. Not too long to 
wait, either — " 



26 




 



That's up to nobody else but 
you! 

I couldn't get much specific information, but then I hadn't expected to. I collected my pay and 
drifted on eastward, talking to people of all classes — farmers, mechanics, shopowners, tramps, and such 
data as I gathered tallied with 
those of Intelligence. 

About twenty-five per cent ojf 
the population, in North America 
at least — it was higher in the Orient 
and Africa — was satisfied with the 
Imperium, felt they were better off 
than they would have been in the 
old days. "The Eridanians are 
pretty decent, on the whole. Some 
of 'em come in here and act nice 
and human as you please." 

Some fifty per cent was vaguely 
dissatisfied, wanted "freedom" 
without troubling to define the 
term, didn't like the taxes or the 
labor draft or the enforced disarmament or the legal and social superiority of Valgolians or some such 
thing, had perhaps suffered in the 
reconquest. But this group constituted no real threat. It would tend 
to be passive whatever happened. 
Its greatest contribution would be 
sporadic rioting. 

The remaining twenty-five per 
cent was bitter, waiting its chance, 
muttering of a day of revenge — 
and some portion of this segment 
was spreading propaganda, secretly 
manufacturing and distributing 
weapons, engaging in clandestine 
military drill, and maintaining con


tact with the shadowy Legion of 
Freedom. 

Childish, melodramatic name ! 
But it had been well chosen to appeal to a certain type of mind. The 
real, organized core of the anarch 
movement was highly efficient. In 
those months I spent wandering 
and waiting, its activities mounted 
almost daily. 

THE illegal radio carried unending programs, propaganda, 
fabricated stories of Valgolian brutality. I knew from personal experience that some were false, and 
I knew the whole Imperial system 
well enough to spot most of the 
rest at least partly invented. I realized we couldn't trace such a wellorganized setup of mobile and coordinated units, and jamming 
would have been poor tactics, but 
even so — • 

The day is coming . . . Earthmen, free men, be ready to throw 
off your shackles . . . Stand by for 
freedom! 

I stuck to my role. When autumn came, I drifted into one of 
the native cities, New Chicago, a 
warren of buildings near the remains of the old settlement, the 
same gigantic slum that its predecessor had been. I got a room in a 
cheap hotel and a job in a steel 
mill. 

I was Conrad Haugen, Norwegian-American, assigned to a spaceship by the labor draft and liking 
it well enough to re-enlist when 



INSIDE EARTH 



27 



my term was up. I had wandered 
through much of the Empire and 
had had a great deal of contact 
with Eridanians, but was most 
emphatically not a Terrie. In fact, 
I thought it would be well if the 
redskin yoke could be thrown off, 
both because of liberty and the 
good pickings to be had in the 
Galaxy if the Empire should collapse. I had risen to second mate 
on an interstellar tramp, but could 
get no further because of the law 
that the two highest officers must 
be Valgolian. That had embittered 
me and I returned to Earth, footloose and looking for trouble. 

I FOUND it. With officer's training and the strength due to a 
home planet with a gravity half 
again that of Earth, I had no difficulty at all becoming a foreman. 
There was a big fellow named 
Mike Riley who thought he was 
entitled to the job. We settled it 
behind a shed, with the workmen 
looking on, and I beat him unconscious as fast as possible. The raw, 
sweating savagery of it made me 
feel ill inside. They'd let this loose 
among the stars! 

After that I was one of the boys 
and Riley was my best friend. We 
went out together, wenching and 
drinking, raising hell in the cold 
dirty canyons of steel and stone 
which the natives called streets. 
Valgolia, Valgolia, the clean bare 
windswept heights of your mountains, soughing trees and thunder


ous waters and Maara waiting for 
me to come home.' Riley often proposed that we find an Eridanian 
and beat him to death, and I would 
agree, hiccupping, because I knew 
they didn't go alone into native 
quarters any more. I sat in the 
smoky reek of the bars, half deafened by the clatter and raucousness 
called music, trying not to think 
of a certain low-ceilinged, quiet 
tavern amid the gardens of Kalariho, and sobbed the bitterness of 
Conrad Haugen into my beer. 

"Dirty redskins," I muttered. 
"Dirty, stinking, bald-headed, sons 
of bitches. Them and their goddamn Empire. Why, y'know, if 't 
hadn' been f their laws I'd be 
skipper o' my own ship now. I 
knew more'n that slob o' a captain. 
But he was born Eridanian — God, 
to get my hands on his throat!" 

Riley nodded. Through the haze 
of smoke I saw that his eyes were 
narrowed. He wasn't drunk when 
he didn't want to be, and at times 
like this he was suddenly as sober 
as I was, and that in spite of not 
having a Valgolian liver. 

I bided my time, not too obviously anxious to contact the 
Legion. I just thought they were 
swell fellows, the only brave men 
left in the rotten, stinking Empire; 
I'd sure be on their side when the 
day came. I worked in the mill, 
and when out with the boys lamented the fact that we were really 
producing for the damned Eridanians, we couldn't even keep the 



28 




 



INSIDE EARTH 29 



products of our own sweat. I wasn't 
obtrusive about it, of course. Most 
of the time we were just boozing. 
But when the talk came to the Empire, I made it clear just where I 
stood. 

THE winter went. I continued 
the dreary round of days, wondering how long it would take, 
wondering how much time was left. 
If the Legion was at all interested, 
they would be checking my background right now. Let them. There 
wouldn't be much to check, but 
what there was had been carefully 
manufactured by the experts of the 
Intelligence Service. 

Riley came into my room one 
evening. His face was tight, and 
he plunged to business. "Con, do 
you really mean all you've said 
about the Empire?" 

"Why, of course. I — " I glanced 
out the window, as if expecting to 
see a spy. If there were any, I knew 
he would be native. The Empire 
just doesn't have enough men for 
a secret police, even if we wanted 
to indulge in that sort of historically ineffective control. 

"You'd like to fight them? Like 
really to help the Legion of Freedom when they strike?" 

"You bet your obscenity life!" I 
snarled. "When they land on Earth, 
I'll get a gun somewhere and be 
right there in the middle of the 
battle with them!" 

"Yeah." Riley puffed a cigaret 
for a while. Then he said, "Look, 



I can't tell you much. I'm taking a 
chance just telling you this. It could 
mean my life if you passed it on 
to the Eridanians." 
"I won't." 

His eyes were bleak. "You 9amn 
well better not. If you're caught at 
that — " 

He drew a finger sharply across 
his throat. 

"Quit talking like a B-class 
stereo," I bristled. "If you've got 
something to tell me, let's have it. 
Otherwise get out." 

"Yeah, sure. We checked up on 
you, Con, and we think you're as 
good a prospect as we ever came 
across. If you want to fight the Eridanians now — join the Legion now 
— here's your chance." 

"My God, you know I do! But 
who — " 

"I can't tell you a thing. But if 
you really want to join, memorize 
this." Riley gave me a small card on 
which was written a name and address. "Destroy it, thoroughly. Then 
quit at the mill and drift to this 
other place, as if you'd gotten tired 
of your work and wanted to hit the 
road again. Take your time, don't 
make a beeline for it. When you do 
arrive, they'll take care of you." 

I nodded, grimly. "I'll do it, 
Mike. And thanks!" 

"Just my job." He smiled, relaxing, and pulled a flask from his 
overcoat. "Okay, Con, that's that. 
We'd better not go out to drink, 
after this, but nothing's to stop us 
from getting stinko here."

Ill 

SPRING had come and almost 
gone when I wandered into the 
little Maine town which was my 
destination. It lay out of the way, 
with forested hills behind it and the 
sea at its foot. Most of the houses 
were old, solidly built, almost like 
parts of the land, and the inhabitants were slow-spoken, steady folk, 
fishermen and artisans and the like, 
settled here and at home with the 
darkling woods and the restless sea 
and the high windy sky. I walked 
down a narrow street with a cool 
salt bree2e ruffling my hair and 
decided that I liked Portsboro. It 
reminded me of my own home, 
twenty light-years away on the wide 
beaches of Kealvigh. 

I made my way to Nat Hawkins' 
store and asked for work like any 
drifter. But when we were alone in 
the back room, I told him, "I'm 
Conrad Haugen. Mike Riley said 
you'd be looking for me." 

He nodded calmly. "I've been 
expecting you. You can work here a 
few days, sleep at my house, and 
we'll run the tests after dark." 

He was old for an Earthling, well 
over sixty, with white hair and lined 
leathery face. But his blue eyes were 
as keen and steady, his gnarled 
hands as strong and sure as those 
of any young man. He spoke softly 
and steadily, around the pipe which 
rarely left his mouth, and there was 
a serenity in him which I could 
hardly associate with anarch fanati


cism. But the first night he led me 
into his cellar, and through a wellhidden trapdoor to a room below, 
and there he had a complete psychological laboratory. 

I gaped at the gleaming apparatus. "How off Earth — " 

"It came piece by piece, much of 
it from Epsilon Eridani itself," he 
smiled. "There is, after all, no ban 
on humans owning such material. 
But to play safe, we spread the 
purchases over several years, and 
made them in the names of many 
people." 

"But you — " 

"I took a degree in psychiatry 
once. I can handle this." 

He could. He put me through the 
mill in the next few nights — intelligence tests, psychometry, encephalography, narcosis, psycho-probing, 
everything his machines and his' 
skill could cover. He did not find 
out anything we hadn't meant to be 
found out. The Service had ways of 
guarding its agents with counterblocks. But he got a very thorough 
picture of Conrad Haugen. 

In the end he said, still calmly, 
"This is amazing. You have an IQ 
well over the borderline of genius, 
an astonishing variety of assorted 
knowledge about the Empire and 
about technical subjects, and an implacable hatred of Eridanian rule — ■ 
based on personal pique and containing self-seeking elements, but 
no less firm for that. You're out for 
yourself, but you'll stand by your 
comrades and your cause. We'd 



INSIDE EARTH 



31 



never hoped for more recruits of 
your caliber." 

"When do I start?" I asked impatiently. 

"Easy, easy," he smiled. "There's 
time. We've waited fifty years; we 
can wait a while longer." He riffled 
through the dossier. "Actually, the 
difficulty is where to assign you. A 
man who knows astrogation, the use 
of weapons and machines, and the 
Empire, who is physically strong as 
a bull, can lead men, and has a 
dozen other accomplishments, really 
seems wasted on any single job. I'm 
not sure, but I think you'll do best 
as a roving agent, operating between Main Base and the planets 
where we have cells, and helping 
with the work at the base when 
you're there." 

MY HEART fairly leaped into 
my throat. This was more 
than / had dared hope for! 

"I think," said Nat Hawkins, 
"you'd better just drop out of sight 
now. Go to Hood Island and stay 
there till the spaceship comes next 
time. You can spend the interval 
profitably, resting and getting a 
little fattened up; you look half 
starved. And Barbara can tell you 
about the Legion." His leather face 
smiled itself into a mesh of fine 
wrinkles. "I think you deserve that, 
Conrad. And so does Barbara." 

Mentally, I shrugged. My stay in 
New Chicago had pretty well convinced me that all Earthling females 
were sluts. And what of it? 



The following night, Hawkins 
and I rowed out to Hood Island. It 
lay about a mile offshore, a wooded, 
rocky piece of land on which a 
moon-whitened surf boomed and 
rattled. The place had belonged to 
the Hood family since the first settlements here, but Barbara was the 
last of them. 

Hawkins' voice came softly to me 
above the crash of surf, the surge of 
waves and windy roar of trees as we 
neared the dock. "She has more 
reason than most to hate the Eridanians. The Hoods used to be great 
people around here. They were just 
about ruined when the redskins first 
came a-conquering, space bombardment wiped out their holdings, but 
they made a new start. Then her 
grandfather and all his brothers 
were killed in the revolt. Ten years 
ago, her father was caught while 
trying to hijack a jetload of guns, 
and her mother didn't live long 
after that. Then her brother was 
drafted into a road crew and reported killed in an accident. Since 
then she hasn't lived for much except the Legion." 

"I don't blame her," I said. My 
voice was a little tight, for indeed I 
didn't. But somebody has to suffer; 
civilization has a heavy price. I 
couldn't help adding, "But the Empire's lately begun paying pensions 
to cases like that." 

"I know. She draws hers, too, 
and uses it for the Legion." 

Thai, of course, was the reason 
for the pensions. 



32 




 



The boat bumped against the 
dock. Hawkins threw the painter up 
to the man who suddenly emerged 
from the shadow. I saw the cold 
silver moonlight gleam off the rifle 
in his hand. "You know me, Eb," 
said Hawkins. "This here's Con 
Haugen. I slipped you the word 
about him." 

"Glad to know you, Con." Eb's 
horny palm clasped mine. I liked his 
looks, as I did those of most of the 
higher-up Legionnaires. They were 
altogether different from the lowcaste barbarians who were all the 
rebels I'd seen before. They had a 
great load of ignorance to drag with 
them. 

We went up a garden path to a 
rambling stone house. Inside, it was 
long and low and filled with the 
memoirs of more gracious days, art 
and fine furniture, books lining the 
walls, a fire crackling ruddily in the 
living room. 

"Barbara Hood — Conrad Haugen." 

ALMOST, I gaped at her. I had 
expected some gaunt, dowdy 
fanatic, a little mad perhaps. But 
she was — well, she was tall and 
supple and clad in a long dark -blue 
evening gown that shimmered 
against her white skin. She was not 
conventionally pretty, her face was 
too strong for all of its fine lines, 
but she had huge blue eyes and a 
wide soft mouth and a stubborn 
chin. The light glowed gold on the 
hair that tumbled to her shoulders. 



I blurted something out and she 
smiled, with a curious little twist 
that somehow caught in me, and 
said merely, "Hello, Conrad." 

"Glad to be here," I mumbled. 

"The spaceship should arrive in a 
month or so," she went on. "I'll 
teach you as much as I can in that 
time. And you'd better get your own 
special knowledge onto a record 
wire, just in case. I understand 
you've been in the Vegan System, 
for instance, which nobody else in 
the Legion knows very much about." 

Her tone was cool and businesslike, but with an underlying warmth. 
It was like the sea wind which blew 
over the islands, and as reviving. I 
recovered myself and helped mix 
some drinks. The rest of the evening passed very pleasantly. 

Later a servant showed me to my 
room, a big one overlooking the 
water. I lay for a while listening to 
the waves, thinking drowsily how 
rebellion, when its motives were 
honest, drew in the best natives of 
any world, and presently I fell 
asleep. 

The month passed all too quickly 
and agreeably. I learned things 
which Intelligence had spent the 
last three years trying to find out, 
and dared not attempt to transmit 
the information. That was maddening, though I knew there was time. 
But otherwise — 

I puttered about the place. There 
were only three servants, old family 
retainers who had also joined the 
anarchs. They had little modern 



INSIDE EARTH 



33 



machinery, and of course Earthlings 
weren't allowed robots, so there was 
need for an extra man or two. I cut 
wood and repaired the roof and 
painted the boathouse, spaded the 
garden and cleared out brush and 
set up a new picket fence. It was 
good to use my hands and muscles 
again. 

And then Barbara was around to 
help with most of what I did. In 
jeans and jersey, the sun ablaze on 
her hair, laughing at my clumsy 
jokes or frowning over some tough 
bit of work, she was another being 
than the cool, lovely woman who 
talked books and music and history 
with me in the evenings, or the 
crisp bitter anarch who spat facts 
and figures at me like an angry 
machine. And yet they were all her. 
I remembered Ydis, who was dead, 
and the old pain stirred again. But 
Barbara was alive. 

She was more alive to me than 
most of Valgolia. 

I make no apologies for my feelings. I had been away from anything resembling home for some 
two years now. But I was careful to 
remain merely friendly with Barbara. 

SHE didn't know a great deal 
about the rebel movement — no 
one agent on Earth did — but her 
knowledge was still considerable. 
There was a fortified base somewhere out in space, built up over a 
period of four years with the help 
of certain unnamed elements or 




planets outside the Empire. I suspected several rival states of that ! 

Weapons of all kinds were manufactured there in quantities sufficient 
to arm the million or so rebels of 
the "regular" force, the twenty million or so in the Solar System and 
elsewhere who held secret drills and 
conducted terrorist activities, and 
the many millions more who were 
expected to rise spontaneously when 
the rebel fleet struck. 

There was close coordination and 
a central command at Main Base for 
the undergrounds of all dissatisfied 
planets — a new and formidable feature which had not been present in 
the earlier uprisings. There were 
rumors of a new and terrible 
weapon being developed. 

In any case, the plan was to assault Epsilon Eridani itself simultaneously with the uprisings in the 
colonies, so that the Imperial fleet 
would be recalled to defend the 
mother world. The anarchs hoped 
to blast Valgolia to ruin in a few 
swift blows, and expected that the 



34 




 



Empire's jealous neighbors would 
sweep in to complete the wreckage. 

This gentle girl spoke of the 
smashing of worlds, the blasting of 
helpless humans, and the destruction of a culture as if it were a 
matter of insect extermination. 

"Have you ever thought," I asked 
casually once, "that the Juranians 
and the Slighs and our other hypothetical allies may not respect the 
integrity of Sol any more than the 
Eridanians do?" 

"We can handle them," she answered confidently. "Oh, it won't 
be easy, that time of transition. But 
we'll be free." 

"And what then?" I went on. "I 
don't want to be defeatist, Barbara, 
but you know as well as I do that 
the Eridanians didn't conquer all 
mankind at a -single swoop. When 
they invented the interstellar engine 
and arrived here, man was tearing 
the Solar System apart in a war between super-nations that was rapidly 
reducing him to barbarism. The redskins traded for a while, sold arms, 
some of their adventurers took sides 
in the conflict, the government 
stepped in to protect Eridanian citizens and investments — the side 
which the Eridanians helped won 
the war, then found its allies were 
running things and tried to revolt 
against the protectorate — and without really meaning to, the strangers 
were conquering and ruling Earth. 

"But the different factions of man 
still hate each other's guts. There 
are still capitalists and communists, 



blacks, whites and Browns, Hindus 
and Moslems, Germans and Frenchmen, city people and country people 
— a million petty divisions. There'll 
be civil war as soon as the Eridanians are gone." 

"Some, perhaps," she agreed. 
"But I think it can be handled. If 
we have to have civil wars, well, 
let's get them over with and live as 
free men." 

Personally, I could see nothing 
in the sort of military dictatorship 
that would inevitably arise which 
was preferable to an alien, firm, but 
just rule that insured stability and a 
reasonable degree of individual liberty. 

But I didn't say that aloud. 

ANOTHER time we talked of 
the de-industrialization of 
Earth. Barbara was, of course, venomous about it. "We were rich 
once," she said. "All Earth was. We 
have one of the richest planets in 
the Galaxy. But because their own 
world is poor, the redskins have to 
take the natural resources of their 
conquests. Earth is a granary and a 
lumberyard for Valgolia, and the 
iron of Mars and the petrolite of 
Venus go back to their industry. 
What few factories they allow us, 
they take their fat percentage of 
the product." 

"Certainly they've made us economically dependent," I said, "and 
their standard of living is undoubtedly higher than ours. But ours has, 
on the whole, gone up since the 



36 




 



conquest. We eat better, we're 
healthier, we aren't burdened with 
the cost of past and present and future wars. Our natural resources 
aren't being squandered. The forests 
and watersheds and farmlands we 
ruined are coming back under Eridanian supervision." 

She gave me an odd look. "I 
thought you didn't like the Empire." 

"I don't," I growled. "I don't 
want to be held back just because 
I'm white-skinned. But I've known 
enough reddies personally so that I 
try to be fair." 

"It's all right with me," she said. 
"I can see your point, intellectually, 
though I can't really jeel it. But not 
many of the people will out at 
Main Base." 

"Free men," I muttered sardonically. 

We went fishing, and swam in 
the tumbling surf, and stretched 
lazily on the beach with the sun 
pouring over us. Or we might go 
tramping off into the woods on a 
picnic, to run laughing back when a 
sudden rain rushed out of the sky, 
and afterward sit with beer and 
cheese sandwiches listening to a 
wire of Beethoven or Mozart or 
Tschaikowsky — the old Earthlings 
could write music, if they did nothing else! — and to the rain shouting 
on the roof. We might have a little 
highly illegal target practice, or a 
game of chess, or long conversations 
which wandered off every which 
way. I began to have a sneaking 



hope fhat the spaceship would be 
delayed. 

We went out one day in Barbara's 
little catboat. The waves danced 
around us, chuckling against the 
hull, glittering with sunlight, and 
the sail was like a snow mountain 
against the sky. For a while we 
chatted dreamily, ate our lunch, 
threw the scraps to the hovering 
gulls. Then Barbara fell silent. 

"What's the matter?" I asked. 

"Oh, nothing. Touch of W ellscbmerz, maybe." She smiled at me. 
"You know, Con, you don't really 
belong in the Legion." 

"How so?" I raised my eyebrows. 

"You — well, you're so darned 
honest, so really decent under that 
carefully rough surface, so — reasonable. You'll never make a good 
fanatic." 

Honest! I looked away from her. 
The bright day seemed suddenly to 
darken. 

IV 

SPACESHIPS from Main Base 
had little trouble coming to 
Earth with their cargoes of guns, 
propaganda, instructors, and whatever else the rebels on the planet 
needed. They would take up an orbit just beyond the atmosphere and 
send boats to the surface after dark. 
There was little danger of their 
being detected if they took the usual 
precautions; a world is simply loo 
big to blockade completely. 

Ours dropped on noiseless grav

itic beams into the nigh ted island 
woods. We had been watching for 
it the last few days, and now Eb 
came running to tell us it was here. 
The pilot followed after him. 

"Harry Kane, Conrad Haugen," 
Barbara introduced us. 

I shook hands, sizing him up. He 
was tall for an Earthling, almost as 
big as I, dark-haired, with goodlooking young features. He wore 
some approximation of a uniform, 
dark-blue tunic and breeches, peaked 
cap, captain's insignia, which gave 
him a rather dashing look. It 
shouldn't have made any difference 
to me, of course, but I didn't like 
the way he smiled at Barbara. 

She explained my presence, and 
he nodded eagerly. "Glad to have 
you, Haugen. We need good men, 
and badly." Then to her: "Get 
Hawkins. You and he are recalled 
to Main Base." 

"What? But—" 

A dark exultation lit his face. 
"The time for action is near — very 
near! We're pulling all our best 
agents off the planets. They can 
work more effectively with the fleet 
now." 

I tried to look as savagely gleeful 
as they, but inwardly I groaned. 
How in all the hells was I going to 
contact Vorka? If I were stranded 
out in space when the fleet got 
under way — no, they must have an 
ultrabeam. I'd manage somehow to 
call on that even if they caught me 
at it. 

We sent Eb in a boat to get 



Hawkins while Barbara and I 
packed a few necessities. Kane 
paced back and forth, spilling out 
the news from Main Base, word of 
mighty forces gathering, rumors of 
help promised from outside, it was 
like the thunder which mutters just 
before a gale. 

Presently Hawkins arrived. The 
old man's calm was undisturbed: he 
puffed his pipe and said quietly, "I 
called up my housekeeper, told her 
my sister in California was suddenly taken sick and I was leaving 
at once for the transcontinental jetport. Just to account for disappearing, you know. There aren't any 
Eridanians or Terries hereabouts, 
but we desperate characters — " he 
grinned, briefly — "can't be too careful. Brought my equipment along, 
of course. I suppose they want me 
to do psychometry on fleet personnel?" " 

"Something on that order. I don't 
know." 

We made our way through a fine 
drizzle of rain to the little torpedo 
of the spaceboat. I looked around 
into the misty dark and breathed a 
deep lungful of the cool wet wind. 
And I saw that Barbara was doing 
the same. 

SHE smiled up at me through the 
night and the thin sad rain. 
"Earth is a beautiful world, Con," 
she whispered. "I wonder if we'll 
ever see it again." 

I squeezed her hand, silently, and 
we crowded into the boat.

Kane made a smooth takeoff. In 
minutes we were beyond the atmosphere, Earth was a great glowing shield of cloudy blue behind us, 
and the stars were bitter bright 
against darkness. We sent a coded 
call signal and got a directional 
beam from the ship. Before long we 
were approaching it. 

I studied the lean black cruiser. 
She seemed to be of about the same 
design as the old Solarian interplanetary ships, modified somewhat 
to accommodate the star drive. Apparently, she was one of those built 
at Main Base. Her bow guns were 
dark shadows against the clotted 
cold silver of the Milky Way. I 
thought of the death and the ruin 
which could flame from them, I 
thought of the hell she and her 
kind bore — atomic bombs, radiodust 
bombs, chemical bombs, disease 
bombs, gravity snatchers, needle 
beams, disintegrative shells, darkness and doom and the new barbarism — and felt a stiffening within 
me. Fostering this murderousness 
was a frightful risk. The main defense against it was Intelligence, 
and that depended on agents like 
myself. Perhaps only myself. 

The crew was rather small, no 
battles being anticipated. But they 
were well disciplined, uniformed 
and trained, a new Solarian army 
built up from the fragments of the 
old. The captain was a stiff gray 
German who had been a leader in 
the earlier revolt and since fled to 
space, but most of the officers, such 



as Kane, were young and violent in 
their eagerness. 

We orbited around the planet for 
another day or so till all the boats 
had returned. There was tension in 
the ship — if the Imperial navy 
should happen to spot us, we were 
done. Off duty, we would sit around 
talking, smoking, playing games 
with little concentration. 

Kane spent most of his free hours 
with Barbara. They had much to 
talk about. I swallowed a certain irrational jealousy and wandered 
around cautiously pumping as many 
men as I could. 

We got under way at last. By this 
time I had learned that Main Base 
was a planet, but no more. Only the 
highest leadership of the Legion 
knew its location, and they were 
pledged to swallow the poison they 
always carried if there seemed to be 
any danger of capture. 

For several days by the clocks we 
ran outward, roughly toward Draco. 
Our velocity was not revealed, and 
the slow shift in the outside view 
didn't help much. I guess that we 
had come perhaps ten parsecs, but 
that was only a guess. 

"Approaching Main Base. Stand 
by." 

WHEN the call rang hollowly 
down the ship's passageways, 
I could feel the weariness and tautness easing, I could see homecoming 
in the faces around me. I stole a 
glance at Barbara. Her eyes were 
wide and litr lips parted, she looked 



INSIDE EARTH 



39 



ahead as if to stare through the 
metal walls. She had never been 
here either, here where all her 
dreams came home. 

So we landed, we slipped down 
out of the dark and the cold and the 
void, and I heard the rattle and 
groan of metal easing into place. 
When the ship's interior grav-ficld 
was turned off, I felt a sudden 
heaviness; this world had almost a 
quarter again the pull of Earth. But 
people got used to that quickly 
enough. It was the landscape which 
was hard to bear. 

They had told us that even 
though Boreas had a breathable atmosphere and a temperature not always fatally low, it was a bleak 
place. But to one who had never 
been far from the lovely lands of 
Earth, its impact was like a blow in 
the face. Barbara shuddered close 
to me as we came out of the airlock, 
and I put an arm about her waist, 
knowing the sudden feeling of loneliness which rose in her. 

SAVE for the spaceport and other 
installations, Main Base was 
underground. There was no city to 
relieve the grimness of the scene. 
We were in a narrow valley between 
sheer, ragged cliffs that soared crazily into a murky sky. The sun was 
low, a smouldering disc of dull red 
like curdling blood; its sullen light 
glimmered on the undying snow 
and ice and seemed only to make 
the land darker. Stars glittered here 
and there in the dusky heavens, 



hard and bright and cruel, almost, 
as in space. 

Dark sky, dark land, dark world, 
with the sheer terrible mountains 
climbing gauntly for the upper 
gloom, crags and glaciers like fangs 
against the dizzy cliffs, with the 
great shadows marching across the 
bloody snow toward us, with a 
crazed wind muttering and whining 
and chewing at our flesh. It was 
cold. The cold was like a knife. 
Pain stung with every breath and 
eyes watered with tears that froze 
on suddenly numb cheeks. A great 
shudder ripped through us and we 
ran toward the entrance to the city. 
The snow crunched dry and old 
under our boots, the cold ate up 
through the soles, and the wind 
whistled its scorn. 

Even when an elevator had 
taken us a mile down into the 
warmth and light of the base, we 
could not forget. It was a city for 
a million men and other beings 
and more than a few women and 
children, a city of long streets and 
small neat apartments, hydroponic 
farms and food synthesizers, 
schools, shops and amusement 
places, factories, military barracks 
and arsenals, even an occasional 
little flower garden. Its people 
could live here almost indefinitely, 
working and waiting for their day 
of rising. 

There was little formality in the 
civilian areas. Everyone who had 
come this far was trusted. A man 
came up to us new arrivals from 



40 




 



Earth, asked about conditions there, 
and then said he would show us 
to our quarters. Later we would be 
told to whom we should report for 
duty. 

"Let's go, then, Con," said Barbara, and slipped a cool little hand 
into mine. I could not refrain from 
casting a smug backward glance at 
the somewhat chapfallen Kane. 

V 

WE SLIPPED quickly into the 
the routine of the place. It 
was a taut-nerved, hard-working 
daily round. I could feel the savage expectancy building up like a 
physical force, but intelligent life 
is adaptable and we got used to it. 
There was work to do. 

Hawkins was second in command 
of the psychological service, testing and screening and treating personnel, working on training and 
indoctrination, and with a voice in 
the general staff where problems of 
unit coordination and psychological 
warfare were concerned. Barbara 
worked under him, secretary and 
records keeper and general troubleshooter. Those were high posts, but 
both were allowed to retain the 
nominally civilian status which they 
preferred. 

Their influence and my own test 
scores got me appointed assistant 
supervisor of the shipyards. That 
suited me very well — I was reasonably free from direct orders and 
discipline, with authority to come 



and go pretty much as I pleased. 
They kept me busy; sometimes I 
worked the clock around, and I did 
my best to further production of 
the weapons which might destroy 
my planet. For whatever I did 
would make little difference at this 
late date. 

A good deal of my time also 
went to drill with the armed forces 
of which, like every able-bodied 
younger man, I was a reserve member. They put me in an engineer 
unit and I soon had command of 
it. I did my best here too, whipping my grim young charges into a 
sapper group comparable to the 
Empire's, for I had to be above all 
suspicion, even of incompetence. 

We worked at our learning. We 
went topside and shivered and 
manned our guns, set our mines 
and threw up our bridges, in the 
racking cold of Boreas. Over ancient snow and ice we trotted, lost 
in the jumbled wilderness of cruel 
peaks and railing wind, peeling the 
skin from our fingers when we 
touched metal, camped under 
scornful stars and a lash of drifting 
ice-dust — but we learned! 

My own, more private education 
went on apace. I found where we 
were. It was a forgotten red dwarf 
star out near the shadowy border 
of the Empire, listed in the catalogues as having one Class III 
planet of no interest or value. That 
was a good choice; no spaceship 
would ever happen into this system 
by accident or exploration. The an


INSIDE EARTH 



41 



archs had built their hopes on the 
one lonely planet, and had named 
it Boreas after the god of the north 
wind in one of their mythologies. 
My company called it less complimentary things. 

The base, including the attached 
city, was under military command 
which ultimately led up to the general staff of the Legion. This was 
a council of officers from half a 
score of rebellious planets, though 
Earthlings predominated and, of 
course, Simon Levinsohn held the 
supreme authority. I met him a few 
times, a gaunt, lonely man, enormously able, ridden by his cause as 
by a nightmare, but not unkindly 
on a personal level. With just that 
indomitable heart, the Maccabees 
had faced Rome's iron legions — 
Valgolia was greatly interested in 
the ancient history of a conquered 
province, knowing how often it 
held the key to current problems. 

There was also a liaison officer 
from Luron sitting at staff meetings. 
Luron ! 

WHEN I first saw him, this 
Colonel Wergil, I stood stiff 
and cold and felt the bristling along 
my spine. He looked as humanoid 
as most of the races at the base. 
Hairless, faintly scaled greenishyellow skin, six fingers to a hand, 
and flat chinless face don't make 
that breed hideous to me; I have 
reckoned Ganolons and Mergri 
among my friends. But Luron — 
the old and deadly rival, the lesser 



empire watching its chance to 
pounce on us, hating us for the 
check we are on the ambitions of 
their militarists. Luron. 

I have no race prejudices and 
am willing to take the word of our 
comparative psychologists that there 
is no more inherent evil in the 
Luronians than in any other stock, 
that the peculiar cold viciousness 
of their civilization is a matter of 
unfortunate cultural rather than 
biological evolution and could be 
changed in time. But none of this 
alters the fact that at present they 
are what they are, brilliant, greedy, 
heartless, and a menace to the peace 
of the Galaxy. I have been too long 
engaged in the struggle between 
my nation and theirs to think 
otherwise. 

Other states had sent some clandestine help to the Legion, weapons 
and money and vague promises. 
Luron, I soon found, had said it 
would attack us in full strength if 
the uprising showed a good chance 
of success, and meanwhileithey gave 
assistance, credits and materiel and 
the still more important machine 
tools, and Wergil's military advice 
was useful, 

I know now, as I suspected even 
then, that Levinsohn and his associates were not fooled as to Luron's 
ultimate intentions. Indeed, they 
planned to make common cause 
with what remained of Valgolia, as 
well as certain other traditional 
foes of their present ally, as soon 
as they had gained their objectives 



42 




 



of independence, and stop any 
threat of aggression from Luron. 
It was shrewdly planned, but such 
a shaky coalition, still bleeding 
with the hurts and hatreds of a 
struggle just ended, would be 
weaker than the Empire, and Luron 
almost certainly would have sowed 
further dissension in it and waited 
for its decay before striking. 

The Earthlings have a proverb 
to the effect that he who sups with 
the Devil must use a long spoon. 
But they seemed to have forgotten 
it now. 

The attack, I learned, was scheduled for about four months from 
the time the agents were recalled. 
The rebels were counting on the 
Valgolian power being spread too 
thinly over the Empire to stand off 
their massed assault on a few key 
points. Then, with the home planet 
a radioactive ruin, with revolt in a 
score of planetary systems and the 
ensuing chaos and communications 
breakdown, and with the Luronians 
invading, the Imperial fleet and 
military would have to make terms 
with the anarchs. 

IT WOULD work. I knew with 
a dark chill that it would work. 
Unless somehow I could get a warning out. That had to be done for 
more than the protection of Epsilon 
Eridani, which, even in a surprise 
attack could defend itself better 
than these conspirators realized. But 
all bloodshed should be spared, if 
possible — and the rebellion did not 



yet deserve to succeed, for the unity 
achieved thus far had been the unity 
of a snake pit against a temporary 
enemy. 

Did it all rest on me? God of 
space, had the whole burden of history suddenly fallen on my shoulders ? 

1 didn't dare think about it. I 
forced the consequences of failure 
out of my forebrain, back down 
into the unconscious, the breeding 
ground of nightmares, and lived 
from one day to the next. I worked, 
and waited, learned what I could 
and watched for my chance. 

But it was not all grimness and 
concentration. It couldn't be; intelligent life just isn't built that 
way. We had our social activities, 
small gatherings or big parties, we 
relaxed and played. At first 1 found 
that gratifying, for it gave me a 
chance to pump the others. Then I 
found it maddening, because it kept 
me from snooping and laying plans. 
Finally it began to hurt — I was 
coming to know the anarchs. 

They lived and laughed and 
loved even as humans do. They 
were basically as decent and reasonable as any similar group of Valgolians. Many were as tormented 
as I by the thought of the slaughter 
they readied. There were embittered 
ones, who had lost all they held 
dear, and I realized that, while 
civilization has its price, you can't 
be objective about it when you are 
the one who must pay. There were 
others who had been well off and 



INSIDE EARTH 



43 



had chucked all their hopes to join 
a desperate cause in which they 
happened to believe. There were 
children — and what had they done 
to deserve having their parents 
gambling away life? 

In spite of their appearance, to 
which I was now accustomed, they 
were human. When I had laughed 
and talked and sung and drunk 
beer and danced and arranged entertainments with them, they were 
my friends. 

Moodily, I began to see that I 
would be one of the price-payers. 

I saw most of Hawkins and Barbara, and after them — because of 
her — Kane. The old psychologist 
and I got along famously. He would 
drop into my room for a smoke and 
a cup of coffee and a drawled conversation whenever he had the 
chance. His slow gentle voice, his 
trenchancy, the way the little crinkles appeared around his eyes when 
he smiled, reminded me of my 
father. I often wish those two 
could have met. They would have 
enjoyed each other. 

Then Barbara would stop by on 
her way from work, or, better yet, 
she would ask me over to her apartment for a home-cooked dinner. 
Yes, she could cook too. We would 
sometimes take long walks down 
the corridors of the city, we even 
went up once in a while to the 
surface for a breath of cold air and 
loneliness, and it was the most 
natural thing in the world for us 
to go hand in hand. 



There was no sunlight underground. But when the fluorotube 
glow shone on her hair, I thought 
of sunlight on Earth, the high keen 
light of the Colorado plateaus, the 
morning light stealing through the 
trees of Hood Island. 

Ydis, Ydis, I said, once your violet eyes were like the skies over 
Kalariho, over Kealvigh, our borne, 
pasture land of winds. But it has 
been so long. It has beet; ten years 
since you died — 

I fought. May all the gods bear 
witness that I fought myself. And 
I thought I was winning. 

VI 

I WILL never forget one certain 
evening. 

Hawkins and I had come over to 
Barbara's for supper, and the three 
of us were sitting now, talking. 
Wier.iawski's Violin Concerto cried 
its sorrow, muted in the background, and the serene home she 
had made of the bare little functional apartment folded itself 
around us. Then Kane dropped in 
as he often did, with a casualness 
that fooled nobody, and sat with 
all his soul in his eyes, looking at 
Barbara. He was a nice kid. I didn't 
know why he should annoy me so. 

The talk shifted to Valgolia. I 
found myself taking the side of my 
race. It wasn't that I hoped to convert anyone, but — well, it was 
wrong that we should be monsters 
in the sight of these friends. 



44 




 



"Brutes," said Kane. "Twolegged animals. Damned bald-headed, copper-skinned giants. Wouldn't be quite so bad if they were 
octopi or insects, but they're just 
enough different from us to be a 
caricature. It's obscene." 

"Sartons look like a dirty joke 
on mankind," I said. "Why don't 
you object to them?" 

"They're in the same boat as us." 

"Then why mix political and 
esthetic prejudices? And have you 
ever thought that you look just as 
funny to an Eridanian?" 

"No race should look odd to 
another," said Nat Hawkins. He 
puffed blue clouds. "Even by our 
standards, the redskins are handsome, in a more spectacular way 
than humans, maybe." 

"And Barbara," I smiled, with 
a curious little pang inside me, 
"would look good to any humanoid." 

"I should think so," said Kane 
sulkily. "The redskins took enough 
of our women." 

"Well," I said, "their original 
conquistadores were young and 
healthy, very far from home, and 
had just finished a hard campaign 
where they lost many friends. At 
least there were no half-breeds 
afterward. And since the reconquest 
none of their soldiers has been permitted to have anything to do with 
an Earthwoman against her consent. It's not their fault if the 
consent is forthcoming oftener than 
you idealists think." 



"That sort of thing was more or 
less standard procedure at home 
with them, wasn't it?" asked 
Hawkins. 

I NODDED. "The harshness of 
their native world forced them 
to develop their technology faster 
than on Earth, so they kept a lot 
of barbarian customs well into the 
industrial age. For instance, the 
rulers of the state that finally con-, 
quered all the others and unified 
the planet took the title Waehing, 
Emperor, and it's still a monarchy 
in theory. But a limited monarchy 
these days, with parliamentary democracy and even local self-government of the town-meeting sort. 
They're highly civilized now." 

"I wouldn't call that spree of 
conquest they went on exactly civilized." 

"Well, just for argument's sake, 
let's try to look at it from their 
side," I answered. "Here their explorers arrived at Sol, found a system richer than they could well 
imagine — and all the wealth being 
burned up in fratricidal war. Their 
technical power was sufficiently beyond ours so that any band of adventurers could do pretty much as 
it wanted in the Solar System, and 
all native states were begging for 
their help. It was inevitable that 
they'd mix in. 

"Sure, the Eridanians have been 
exploiting Solarian resources, 
though perhaps more wisely than 
we did. Sure, they garrison un


INSIDE EARTH 



45 



willing planets. But from their 
point of view, they're slowly civilizing a race of atomic-powered 
savages, and taking no more than 
their just reward for it. Sure, 
they've done hideous things, or 
were supposed to have, but there' ve 
been plenty of reforms in their 
policy since our last revolt. They've 
adopted the — the red man's burden." 

"Could be. But Sol wasn't their 
only conquest." 

"Oh, well, of course they had 
their time of all-out imperialism. 
There are still plenty of the old 
school around, starward the course 
of empire, keep the lesser breeds 
in their place, and so on. That's 
one reason why the highest posts 
are still reserved for members of 
their own race, another being that 
even the liberal ones don't trust us 
that far, yet. 

"Their first fifty years or so saw 
plenty of aggression. But then they 
stabilized. They had as much as 
they could manage. To put it baldly, the Empire is glutted. And now, 
without actually admitting they ever 
did wrong, they're trying to make 
up what they did to many of their 
victims." 

"They could do that easily 
enough. Just let us go free." 

<<T'VE already told you why they 
-L don't dare. Apart from fearing us, they're economically and 
militarily dependent on their colonies. You're an American, Nat. 



Why didn't our nation let the South 
go its own way when it wanted to 
secede? Why don't we all go back 
to Europe and let the Indians have 
our country? 

"And, of course, Epsilon Eridani honestly thinks it has a great 
civilizing mission, and is much 
better for the natives than any lesser 
independence could ever be. In 
some cases, you've got to admit 
they're right. Have you ever seen 
a real simon-pure native king in 
action? Or read the history of nations like Germany and Russia? 
And why do we have to segregate 
races and minorities even in our 
own organization to prevent 
clashes?" 

"We're getting there," said Nat 
Hawkins. "It's not easy, but we'll 
make it." 

Only you're not there yet, I 
thought, and for that reason you 
must be stopped. 

"You claim they're sated," said 
Barbara. "But they've kept on conquering here and there, to this very 
day." 

"Believe it or not, but with rare 
exceptions that's been done reluctantly. Peripheral systems have 
learned how to build star ships, 
become nuisances or outright menaces, and the Empire has had to 
swallow them. Modern technology 
is simply too deadly for anarchy. 
A full-scale war can sterilize whole 
planets. That's another function of 
empire, so the Eridanians claim — 
just to keep civilization going till 



46 




 



something better can be worked 
out." 

"Such as what?" 

"Well, several worlds already 
have donagangor status — self-government under the Emperor, representatives in the Imperial Council, 
and no restrictions on personal advancement of their citizens. Virtual 
equality with the Valgolians. And 
their policy is to grant such status 
to any colony they think is ready 
for it." 

Hawkins shook his head. "Won't 
do, Con. It sounds nice, but old 
Tom Jefferson had the right idea. 
'If men must wait in slavery until 
they are ready for freedom, they 
will wait long indeed.' " 

"Who said we were slaves — " I 
began. 

"You talk like a damned reddie. 
yourself," said Kane. "You seem 
to think pretty highly of the Empire." 

I GAVE him a cold look. "What 
do you think I'm doing here?" 
I snapped. 

"Yeah. Yeah, sorry. I'm kind of 
tired. Maybe I'd better go now." 
Before long Kane made some 
rather moody good nights and went 
out. 

Nat Hawkins twinkled at me. 
"I'm a little bushed myself," he 
said. "Guess I'll hit the bunk too." 

When he was gone, I sat smoking and trying to gather up the 
will to leave. There was a darkness in me. What, after all, was 



I doing here? Gods, I believed I 
was in the right, but why is right 
so pitiless? 

On Earth they represent the goddess of justice as blind. On Valgolia she has fangs. 

Barbara came over and sat on 
the arm of my chair. "What's the 
matter, Con?" she asked. "You 
look pretty grim these days." 

"My work's developing some 
complications," I said tonelessly. 
My mind added : It sure is. No way 
to call headquarters, the rebellion 
gathering enormous momentum, 
and on a basis of treachery and racial hatred. 

Barbara's fingers rumpled my 
hair, the grafted hair which by 
now felt more a part of me than 
my own lost crest. "You're an odd 
fellow," she said quietly. "On the 
surface so frank and friendly and 
cheerful, and down underneath 
you're hiding yourself and your 
private unhappiness." 

"Why," I looked up at her, astonished, "even the psychologists — " 

"They're limited, Con. They can 
measure, but they can't feel. Not 
the way — " 

She stopped, and the light 
glowed in her hair and her eyes 
were wide and serious on mine and 
one small hand stole over to touch 
my fingers. Blindly, I wrenched 
my face away. 

Her voice was low. "It's some 
other woman, isn't it?" 

"Other — ? Well, no. There was 



INSIDE EARTH 



47 



one, but she's dead now. She died 
ten years ago." 

Ydis, Ydis! 

"Your wife?" 

I nodded. "We were only 
married for three years. My daughter is still alive; she's going on 
twelve now. But I haven't seen her 
for over two years. She's not on 
Earth. I wonder if she even thinks 
of me." 

"Con," said Barbara, very softly 
and gravely, "you can't go on 
mourning a woman forever." 

"I'm not. Forget it. I shouldn't 
have spoken about it." 

"You needed to. That's all 
right." 

"My girl ought to have a 
mother — " The words came of 
themselves. What followed thereafter seemed also to happen without my willing it. 

Presently Barbara stood back 
from me. She was laughing, low 
and sweet and joyous. "Con, you 
old sourpuss, cheer up! It isn't that 
bad, you know!" 

I managed a wry grin, though it 
seemed to need all the energies left 
in me. "You look so happy your 
fool self that I have to counterbalance it." 

"Con, if you knew how I'd been 
hoping!" 

We talked for a long time, but 
she did most of it — the plans, the 
hopes, the trip we were going to 
take and the house we were going 
to build down by the seashore — 
"Mary," my daughter, was going 



to have a home, along with the 
dozen brothers and sisters she'd 
have in due course — after the war. 
After the war. 

I left, finally, stumbling like a 
blind man toward my quarters. Oh, 
yes, I loved her and she loved me 
and we were going to have a home 
and a sailboat and a dozen children, after the w r ar, when Earth 
was free. What more could a man 
ask for? 

It had been many years since I'd 
needed autohypnosis to put myself 
to sleep, but I used it now. 

VII 

A MONTH passed. 
The delay was partly due 
to the slowness with which I had 
\o work, even after a plan had been 
laid. I could only do a little at a 
time, and the times had to be well 
separated. Each day brought the moment' of onslaught closer, but I 
dared not hurry myself. If they 
caught me at my work, there would 
be an end of all things. 

But I cannot swear that my own 
mind did not prompt me to an unnatural slowness and caution. I was 
only human, and every day was 
one more memory. 

They had all been very good to 
us; our friends had a party to celebrate our engagement and we were 
universally congratulated and all 
the rest of it. Yes, Kane was there 
too, shaking my hand and wishing 
me all the luck in the world. After

ward he went back to his work and 
his pilot's practice with a strange 
fierceness. 

If at times I fell into glum abstraction, well, I had always been 
a little moody and Barbara could 
tease me out of it. Most of the 
times I was with her, I didn't think 
about the future at all. 

There had been a certain deep 
inward coldness to her. She had 
carried the old wound of her losses 
with bitter dignity. But as the days 
went on, I saw less and less of it. 
She would even admit that individual Valgolians might be fine fellows and that the Empire had done 
a few constructive things for Earth. 
But it was more than a change of 
attitude. She was thawing after a 
long winter, she laughed more, she 
was wholly human now. 

Human — 

We sat one evening, she and I, in 
one of the big lounges the base had 
for its personnel. There were only 
one or two muted lights in the long 
quiet room, a breathing of music, 
snatches of whispering like our 
own. She sat close against me, and 
my lips kept straying down to brush 
her hair and her cheek. 

"When we're married — " she 
said dreamily. Then all at once: 
"Con, what are we waiting for?" 

I LOOKED at her in some surprise. 

"Con, why do we assume we can't 
get married before the war's over?" 
Her voice was low and hurried, 



shaking just a little. "The base here 
has chaplains. It's less than a month 
now till the business starts. God 
knows what'll happen then. Either 
of us might be killed." I heard her 
gulp. "Con, if they killed you — " 

"They won't," I said. "I'm killproof." 

"No, no. We have so little time, 
and it may be all we'll ever have. 
Marry me now, darling, dearest, 
and at least there'll be something to 
remember. Whatever comes, we'll 
have had that while." 

"I tell you," I insisted, with a 
sudden hideous dismay, "there's 
nothing to worry about. Forget it." 

"Oh, I'm not asking for pity. I've 
more happiness now than is right. 
Maybe that's why I'm afraid. But, 
Con, they killed my father and they 
killed my mother and they killed 
Jimmy, and if they take you too, it'll 
be more than I can stand." 

The savage woe of an old Earthly 
poet lanced through my brain: 

The time is out of joint 
O cursed spite, 
That ever I was bom 
To set it right! 

And then, for just a moment, 
there came the notion of yielding. 
You love the girl, Conru. You love 
her so much it's a pain in you. Well, 
take her! Marry her! 

No. I was not excessively tender 
of heart or conscience, but neither 
was I that kind of scoundrel. 

I kissed her words away. After

ward, alone in the darkness of my 
room, I realized that Conrad Haugen had no good reason to hang 
back. It was true, all she said was 
true, and no other couple was wait 
ing for an uncertain future. 
It was the time for action. 

I HAD been ready for days now, 
postponing the moment. And 
those days were marching to the 
time of war, the rebels were quivering to go, a scant few weeks at most 
lay between me and the ruin of 
Valgolian plans and work and hope. 

In my steadily expanding official 
capacity, I could go anywhere and 
do almost anything in an engineering line. So, bit by bit, I had tinkered with the base's general alarm 
system. 

We had scoutships posted, of 
course, but by the very nature of 
things they had to be close to the 
planet or an approaching enemy 
would slip between them without 
detection. And the substantial vibrations of a ship traveling faster than 
light do not arrive much ahead of 
the ship itself. Whatever warning 
we had of a hypothetical assault 
would be very short. It would be 
signaled to all of us by a siren on 
the intercommunications system, 
and after that it would be battle stations, naval units to their ships and 
all others to such ground defenses 
as we had. 

But modern warfare is all to the 
offense. There is no way of stopping 
an attack from space except by meet


ing it and annihilating it before it 
gets to its destination. The rebels 
were counting on that fact to aid 
them when they struck, but it 
would, of course, work against them 
if their enemy should happen to hit 
first. Everyone was understandably 
nervous about the chance of our 
being discovered and assailed. 

Working a little at a time, I had 
put a special switch in the general 
alarm circuit. It showed up merely 
as one of many on a sector call 
board near my room; no one was 
likely to notice it. And my quarters 
were not those originally given me. 
I had moved to a smaller place farther from Barbara, ostensibly to be 
near my work at the shipyards, actually to be near the base's ultrabeam 
shack. 

Now it was time to act. 

I needed an excuse for not going 
to the gun turret where I was assigned. That involved faking a serious fever, but like all Intelligence 
men, I had been trained to full psychosomatic integration. The same 
neural forces that in hysteria produce paralysis, stigmata, and other 
real symptoms were under my conscious control. I thought myself 
sick. By morning I was half delirious and my veins were on fire. 

The surgeon general came to see 
me. "What the hell's the trouble?" 
he wondered. "This place is supposed to be sterile." 

"Maybe it's too damn sterile," I 
murmured with a perfectly genuine 
weakness. Then, fighting the light


50 




 



headedness that hummed and buzzed 
in me: "Tsitbn fever, Doc. I'm sure 
that's what it is." 

"Can't say I've ever heard of it." 

"You'll find it in your medical 
books." He would, too. "It's found 
on the planet Sirius V, where I once 
visited. Filter-passing virus, transmitted by airborne spores. Not contagious here. In humans it becomes 
chronic; no ill effects except a few 
days' fever like this every few years. 
Now go 'way and lemme die in 
peace." I closed my eyes on the distorted and unreal world of sickness. 

LATER Barbara came in, pale 
and with her hair like a rumpled halo. I had to assure her many 
times that I was all right and would 
be on my feet in two or three days. 
Then she smiled and sat down on 
the bunk and passed a cool palm 
over my forehead. 

"Poor Con," she said. "Poor 
squarehead." 

"I feel fine as long as you're 
here," I whispered. 

"Don't talk," she said. "Just go 
to sleep." She kissed me and sat 
quiet. Hers was the rare gift of 
being a definite personality even 
when silent and motionless. I 
clasped her hand and pretended to 
fall into uneasy sleep. After a while 
she kissed me again, very softly, and 
went out. 

I told my body to recover. It took 
time, hours of time, while the stub 
born cells retreated to a normal 
level of activity. I lay there thinking 



of many things, most of them unpleasant. 

It was well into the night, the 
logical time to act even if the factories did go on a twenty-four hour 
basis. 

I got up, still swaying a little 
with weakness, the dregs of the 
fever ringing in my head. After I 
had vomited and swallowed a stimulant tablet, I felt better. I put on my 
uniform, but substituted a plain 
service jacket without insignia of 
rank for the tunic. That should 
make me fairTy inconspicuous in the 
confusion. . 

Strength came. I glanced cautiously along the dim-lit corridor, 
and it was empty and silent. I stole 
out and hurried toward the ultrabeam shack. My hidden switch was 
on the way; I threw it and ran on 
with lowered head. 

The siren screamed behind me, 
before me, around me, the howling 
of all the devils in hell — Hoo! 
boo! Batlle stations! Strange ships 
approaching! Batlle stations! All 
hands to battle stations! Hoo-oo! 

I could imagine the pandemonium that erupted, men boiling out 
of factories and rooms, cursing and 
yelling and dashing frantically for 
their posts — children screaming in 
terror, women white-faced with sudden numbness — weapons manned, 
instruments sweeping the skies, 
spaceships roaring heavenward, incoherent yelling on the intercoms to 
find out who had given that signal. 
With luck, I would have fifteen 



INSIDE EARTH 



51 



minutes or half an hour of safe insanity. 

A few men raced by me, on their 
way to the nearest missile rack. They 
paid me no heed, and I hurried 
along my own path. 

The winding stair leading up to 
the ultrabeam shack loomed before 
me. I went its length, three steps at 
a time, bounding and gasping with 
my haste, up to the transmitter. 

It was the tenuous link binding 
together a score of rebel planets, the 
only communication with the stars 
that glittered so coldly overhead. 
The ultrabeam does not have an infinite velocity, but it does have an 
unlimited speed, one depending 
solely on the frequency of the generating equipment, and since it only 
goes to such receivers as are tuned 
to its pattern — there must be at least 
one such tuned unit for the generator to work — it has a virtually 
infinite range. So men can talk between the stars, but are their words 
the wiser for that? 

UP AND up and up, round and 
round, up and up, metal clanging underfoot and always the demon screech of the siren — up ! 

I sprang from the head of the 
stairs and crossed the areaway in one 
leap to the open door of the shack. 
There was only one operator on 
duty, a slim boyish figure before the 
glittering panel. He didn't hear me 
as I came behind him. I knocked 
him out with a calculated blow to 
the base of the skull. He'd be un


conscious for at least fifteen minutes and that was time enough. I 
heaved his body out of the chair 
and sat down. 

The unit was set for the complicated secret scrambler pattern of the 
Legion, one which was changed 
periodically just in case. I twirled 
the dials, adjusting for the pattern 
of the set I knew was kept tuned for 
me at Vorka's headquarters. 

The set hummed, warming up. I 
lifted my eyes and stared into the 
naked face of Boreas. The shack 
was above ground, itself dominated 
by the skeletal tower of the transmitter, and a broad port revealed 
land and sky. 

Overhead the stars were glittering, bright and hard and cruel, 
flashing and flashing out of the crystal dark. The peaks rose on every 
side, soaring di2ziness of cliffs and 
ragged snarl of crags, hemming us 
in with our tiny works and struggles. It was bitterly, ringingly cold 
out there; the snow screamed when 
you walked on it; the snapping 
thunder of frost-split rock woke the 
dull roar of avalanches, and there 
was the wind, the old immortal 
wind, moaning and blowing and 
wandering under the stars. I saw 
them running, little antlike men 
spilling from their nest and racing 
across the snow before they froze. I 
saw the ships rise one after the 
other and rush darkly skyward. The 
base had come alive and was reaching up to defy the haughty stars. 

The set buzzed and whistled, 



52 




 



warming up, muttering with the 
cosmic interference whose source 
nobody knows. I began to speak into 
the microphone, softly and urgently: 
"Calling Intelligence HQ, Sol HI, 
North America Center. Captain 
Halgan Conru calling North America Center. Come in, enter, come 
in." 

THE receiver rustled -with the 
thin dry voice of the stars. 
Dimly, I could hear the wind outside, snarling around the walls. 

"Come in, Center. Come in, Center." 

"Captain Halgan!" The voice 
rattled into the waiting stillness of 
the shack. "Captain Halgan, is it 
really you?" 

"Get General Vorka at once," I 
said. "Meanwhile, are you recording? All right, be sure you get 
this." 

I told them everything I knew. 
I told them what planet this was, 
and where we were on its surface, 
and what our strength and plans 
were. I gave them the disposition 
of the scoutship pickets, as far as 
those were known to me, and the 
standard Legion recognition signals. 
I finished with an account of the 
savage differences still existing between Earthman and Earthman, and 
Earth and its treacherous allies. And 
all the time I was talking to a recording machine. Nobody was 
listening. 

When I was through, I waited a minute, not feeling any par


ticular emotion. I was too tired. I 
sat there, listening to the wind and 
the interstellar whistling, till Vorka 
spoke to me. 

"Halgan! Halgan, you've done 
it!" 

"Shut up," I said. "What's coming now?" 

"I checked the Fleet units. We 
have a Supernova with escort at 
Bramgar, about fifteen light-years 
from where you are. You are at 
their base, aren't you? Can you 
hold out for two days more?" 

"I think so." 

"Better get into the hills. We 
may have to bombard." 

"Go to hell." I turned off the 
set. 

Now to get back. They must already know it was a trick; they 
must be scouring the base for the 
saboteur. As soon as all loyal men 
were back, the hunt would really 
be on. 

I had, of course, worn gloves. 
There would be no fingerprints. 
And the operator wouldn't know 
who had attacked him. 

I changed the scrambler setting 
to one picked at random. And in 
a corner, as if it had fallen there 
by accident, I dropped a handkerchief stolen from Wergil of Luron. 
The tiny fragments of tissue which 
adhere to such a thing could easily 
be proven to be from him or one 
of his associates, for the basic Luronian life-molecules are all levorotatory. It might help. 

I slipped back down the stairs, 



INSIDE EARTH 



53 



quickly and quietly. It was over. 
The base was as good as taken. 
But there was more to be done. 
Apart from the saving of my own 
life, there was still a desperate need 
for secrecy. For if the rebels knew 
what was coming, they might 
choose to stand and fight, or they 
might flee into the roadless wildernesses of space. Whichever it was, 
all our work and sacrifice would 
have gone for little. 

THE provocateur policy is the 
boldest and most farsighted enterprise ever undertaken. It is the 
first attempt to make history as we 
choose, to control the great social 
forces we are only dimly beginning 
to understand, so that intelligence 
may ultimately be its own master. 

Sure. Very fine and idealistic, and 
no doubt fairly true as well. But 
there is death and treachery in it, 
loneliness and heartbreak, and the 
bitterness of the betrayed. Have we 
the right to set ourselves up as 
God? Can we really say, in our 
omniscience, that everyone but us 
is wrong? There were sane, decent, 
intelligent folk here on Boreas, the 
ones we needed so desperately for 
all civilization. Did we have to 
make them our enemies, so that 
their grandchildren might be our 
friends? 

I didn't know. Wherever I 
turned, there were treason and injustice. However hard I tried to do 
right, I had to wrong somebody. 

I ran on, back to my cabin. I 



peeled off my clothes and dived into 
bed, and by the time they looked in 
on me I had worked back most of 
my fever. 

Don't think, Conru. Don't think 
of this new victory and the safety of 
the Empire. And, perhaps, a step 
closer to the harshly won unity of 
Earth. Don't think of the way the 
light catches in Barbara's hair and 
gets turned into molten gold. 
You've got a fever to create, man. 
You've got to think yourself sick 
again. That ought to be easy. 

VIII 

BARBARA came in. She was 
white and still, and presently 
she leaned her head against my 
breast and cried quietly, for a long 
time. 

"There is a spy here," she told 
me. 

"I heard about it." I stroked her 
hair and held her to me, clumsily. 
"Do you know who it was?" 

"I don't know. Somehow, they 
seem to think the Luronians may be 
guilty, but they aren't sure. They arrested them, and two were killed 
resisting. Colonel Wergil is in the 
brig now, while they decide if 
Luron can still be trusted." 

"It can't," I said. "Earth must 
win alone." 

"We'll win," she said dauntlessly. "With Luron or without it, we'll 
win." Then, like a little frightened 
girl, creeping close to me: "But we 
needed that help so much." 



54 




 



I kissed her and remained silent. 

The next day I got on my feet 
again, weak but recovered. I wandered aimlessly around the base, 
waiting for Barbara to get through 
work, listening to people talk. It 
was ugly, the fear and tension and 
wolfish watchfulness. Whom can we 
trust? Who is the enemy? 

Mostly, they thought the Luronians were guilty. After all, those 
were the only beings on the planet 
who had not had to pass a rigorous 
investigation and psychological examination. But nobody was sure. 

Levinsohn spoke over the televisor. His gaunt, lined face had 
grown very tired, yet there was 
metal in his voice. The new situation necessitated a change of plans, 
but the time of assault would, if 
anything, be moved ahead. "Be of 
good heart. Stand by your comrades. 
We'll still be free!" 

I - went to Barbara's apartment 
and we sat up very late. But even in 
this private record I do not wish to 
say what we talked about. 




ND the next day the Empire 
. came. 



There was one Supernova ship 
with light escort, but that was 
enough. Such vessels have the mass 
of a large asteroid, and one of them 
can sterilize a planet; two or three 
can take it apart. Theoretically, a 
task force comprising twenty Novaclass battleships with escorts can reduce one of those monsters if it is 
willing to lose most of its units. But 



nothing less can even do significant 
damage, and the rebel base did not 
have that much. Nor could they get 
even what they had into full action. 

The ships rushed out of interstellar space, flashing the recognition signals I had given. Before the 
picket vessels suspected what was 
wrong, the Valgolians were on 
them. One managed to bleat a call 
to base and the alarm screamed 
again, men rushed to battle stations. Then the Imperials blanketed 
all communications with a snarl of 
interference through which nothing 
the rebels had could drive. 

So naturally they were thought to 
have been annihilated in a few swift 
blazes of fire and steel, a quick 
clean death and forgetfulness of 
defeat. But only the drivers were 
crippled, and then the Supernova 
yanked the vessels to its titan flanks 
and held them in unbreakable 
gravity beams. The crews would be 
taken later, with narcotic gas or 
paralyzer beams — alive. 

For the Empire needs its rebels. 

I knew the uselessness of going 
to battle stations, so I hung behind, 
seeking out Barbara, whose place 
was with the missile computer bank. 
I met her and Kane in the hallway. 
The boy's face was white, and there 
were tears running down his cheeks. 

"This is the end," he said. 
"They've found us out, and there's 
nothing left but to die. Good by, 
Barbara." He kissed her, wildly, 
and ran for his ship. Moodily, 1 
watched him go. He expected 



INSIDE EARTH 



55 



death, and he would get only capture, and afterward — 

"What are you doing here, 
Con?" asked Barbara. 

"I'm too shaky to be any good in 
the artillery. Let me go with you, I 
can punch a computer." 

She nodded silently, and we 
went off together. 

THE floor shook under us, and a 
crash of rock roared down the 
halls. The heavy weapons on the 
Supernova were bloodlessly reducing our ground installations and our 
ships not yet in action to smashed 
rubble. They would kill not a single 
one of us, except by uncontrollable 
accident, and save many Valgolian 
and Earth lives that way, but it 
wasn't pleasant to be slugged. The 
girl and I staggered ahead. When 
the lights went out, I stopped and 
held her. 

"It's no use," I said. "They've got 
us." 

"Let me go!" she cried. 

I hung on, and suddenly she collapsed against me, crying and shaking. We stood there with the city 
rumbling and shivering around us, 
waiting. 

Presently the Valgolian commander released the interference 
and contacted Levinsohn, offering 
terms of surrender. It seemed to 
Levinsohn, and it was meant to 
seem, that further resistance would 
be useless butchery. His ships were 
gone and his foes need only bombard him to ruin. He capitulated, 



and one by one we laid down our 
arms and filed to meet the victors. 

The terms, as announced by messengers — the intercom was out of 
action — were generous. Leading 
rebels and those judged potentially 
"dangerous" would go to penal 
colonies on various Earthlike 
planets. Except that they weren't 
penal colonies at all, but, of course, 
the Earthlings wouldn't know this. 
They were indoctrination centers, 
and, with all my bitterness, I still 
longed to observe a man like Levinsohn after five years in one of the 
centers. He'd see things in a different perspective. He'd see the Empire for what it was — even if I 
sometimes had a little trouble seeing 
that now — and he'd be a better 
rebel for it. 

Someday Levinsohn and his kind 
would be back on Earth, the new 
leaders ready to lead the way to a 
new tomorrow. And I would be 
with them. 

I'd be back with Levinsohn and 
the rest, and with Barbara, too, and 
we'd try to pave the way to the 
peace and friendship. But meanwhile there'd be other revolutions — 
striving and hoping and breaking 
their hearts daring what they 
thought would be death to win what 
they called freedom and what we 
hoped would be evolution. 

It was the fire to temper a new 
civilization. 

We walked down the hall, Barbara and I, hand in hand, alone in 
spite of all the people who were 



56 




 



shuffling the same way. Most of 
them were weeping. But Barbara's 
head was high now. 

"What will happen to us?" she 
asked. 

"I don't know," I said. "But, 
Barbara, whatever happens after 
this, remember that I love you. Remember that I'll always love you." 

"I love you too," she smiled, and 
kissed me. "We'll be together, Con. 
That's all that matters. We'll be together." 

That was important — and it made 
me feel good. Yes, we'd be together; I'd see to that. But for a 
while Barbara would hate me 
through all the long years of the 
indoctrination. Someday, perhaps, 
she would understand . . . the indoctrination could do it, and I 
could help. But by the gods of 
space, how would it be to take that 
hate all that while? 

WE came out into the central 
chamber where the prisoners 
were gathering to be herded up to 
the ships. Armed Valgolian guards 
stood under the glare of improvised 
lights. Other Imperials were going 
through the city, flushing out those 
who might be hiding and removing 
whatever our armed forces could 
use. The equipment would do no 
one any good here, and Boreas 
would be left to its darkness. 

It was cold in the vast shadowy 
room. The heating plant had broken 
down and the ancient cold of 
Boreas was seeping in. Barbara 



shivered and I held her close to me. 
Nat Hawkins moved over to join 
us, wordlessly. 

I was questioned in a locked 
room by one of the big Valgolian 
officers. He looked at a stereograph 
in his hand and he took me aside, 
but it was not unusual. Many of the 
starbound prisoners were being 
questioned by their guards, and I 
was merely one of them. 

"Colonel Halgen?" the officer 
asked with an eagerness close to 
hero-worship. He was obviously 
fresh from school and military 
terminology came from his lips as if 
it really meant something to a Valgolian. The colonel, of course, 
meant that in a titular sense I had 
been elevated for my work. Funny, 
if you use the language enough, you 
get to believe it yourself. 

"Sir," the young officer continued, "this is one of the greatest 
pieces of work I've ever seen. I am 
to extend the official congratulations of — " 

I let him talk for a while and 
then I raised my hand peremptorily 
and I told him that the girl with the 
Earthling Hawkins was to go along 
for indoctrination, despite the fact 
that her name did not appear on his 
lists. He nodded, and I went back 
to Barbara, but half a dozen men 
had come between us. 

Levinsohn and five guards. The 
man's carriage was still erect, the 
old unbreakable pride and courage 
were still in him. Someone among 
the prisoners broke loose and 



INSIDE EARTH 



57 



rushed at him, cursing, till the Valgolians thrust him back into line. 

"Levinsohn!" screamed the man. 
"Levinsohn, you dirty Jew, you sold 
us out!" 

There you see why this rebellion 
had to be crushed. Earth still had 
.1 long way to go. The Levinsohns, 
the Barbaras, the more promising of 
ihe anarchs would be educated and 
returned and the civilizing process 
would go on. Earth's best and 
bravest would unite and fight us, 
and with each defeat they would 
learn something of what we had to 
teach them, that all races, however 
divergent, must respect each other 
and work together, learn it with an 
intensity which the merely intellectual teaching of schools and 
propaganda could not achieve alone 
— or, at any rate, soon enough. 

Valgolia is the great and lonely 
enemy, the self-appointed Devil 
since none of us can be angels. It is 
the source of challenge and adversity such as has always driven intelligence onward and upward, in 
spite of itself. 

Sooner or later, generations 
hence, perhaps, all the subject 
worlds will have attained internal 
unity, forgetting their very species 
in a common bond of intelligence. 
And on that day Valgolia's work 
will be done. She and her few 
friends, her donagangors, will seemingly capitulate without a fight and 
become simply part of a union of 
free and truly civilized planets. 

And such a union will be firmer 



and more enduring than all the 
tyrant empires of the past. It will 
have the strength of a thousand or 
more races, working together in the 
harmony which they achieved in 
struggling against us. 

THAT is the goal, but it is a 
long way ahead; there may be 
centuries needed, and meanwhile 
Valgolia is alone. 

Barbara would understand. In 
time she would understand what she 
as yet did not even know. But first 
would be the hatred, the cold stark 
hatred that must come of knowing 
who and what I really am. I could 
only wait for that hatred to come 
after she learned, and then wait for 
it to go, slowly, slowly. . . . 

Lines of the Earthlings were filing forward, and, with Nat Hawkins, Barbara waited for me. I 
walked to her and took her hand. 
Her head was high, as high as Levinsohn 's. She expected all of- us to 
die, but she'd meet the relatives and 
friends she thought were dead. 

It would be a great, a crushing 
humiliation, to know one's martyrs 
were alive and being well treated 
and intensively educated by the foe, 
who was supporting and encouraging one's supposedly dangerous 
revolution. 

"It won't be so bad as long as 
we're together, darling," I said. 

She smiled, misunderstanding, 
and kissed me defiantly before our 
Valgolian guards.

THE MOON IS HELL! by John 
W . Campbell, ]r. Fantasy Press, 
Reading, Pa., 1951. $3.00, 256 
pages. 

THIS is ihe big science fiction 
news of the month — a brandnew story by the editor of Astounding Science Fiction, who has not 
written in much too long a time. 

The book is composed of two 
long novelets, one new, one old. 
The old one is The Elder Gods, 
reprinted from the October 1939 
Unknown. This drawn-out, rather 
de Camplike fantasy is actually 
not among the best of Campbell's 
work. 

The Moon Is Hell.' is quite another kettle of fish. This brilliantly 



circumstantial narrative tells, in 
day-by-day diary form, the experiences of the first crew of explorers (ail-American, of course; no 
foreigners allowed, not even any 
dubious foreign names) ever to 
land and live for any length of 
time on the Moon. 

The fifteen explorer-scientists actually succeed in making a remarkably comfortable life for themselves 
during their first two years on the 
Moon's "Dark Side." They have 
their difficulties, to be sure, but 
not until well past the middle of 
the story do these become particularly harrowing. 

Why the ship had to land on the 
side facing away from Earth is not 
reasonably established. Of course,

there would have been no story 
had it landed on the visible hemisphere, since the plot revolves 
around the difficulties the men encounter in communicating with 
Earth from the far side. 

The relief ship that was to take 
them home after their two years 
crashes near their encampment. 
Since Earth has no evidence that 
the explorers themselves are alive, 
the failure of the relief ship to return probably will persuade everyone in the United States that both 
expeditions failed, and no new relief ship will be sent. 

The struggles of the men to get 
to the Earthward side and send 
their signals, and to piece out their 
food supply until a new ship can 
be built, make the latter half of 
the story exceptionally gripping. 

Despite its plot-necessitated inconsistencies, The Moon Is Hell! 
is first-rate stuff, full of ingenious 
solutions to known lunar problems, 
and of the quiet heroism of men 
facing the unknown. 

/, ROBOT, by Isaac Asimov. 
Gnome Press, Inc., New York, 
1950. $2.50, 253 pages. 

HERE is a continuously fascinating book. Asimov has strung 
together nine of his best robot 
stories into an episodic history of 
robotics' first seventy-five years. 
Susan Calvin, the world's first 
"robopsychologist," is the narrator 
who tells a reporter from Interplanetary Press some of the high 



spots in the development of these 
servants of man. 

There is nothing particularly mechanical about the robots themselves, and certainly not about the 
tales describing them, for Asimov 
has a first-rate talent for humanizing his positronic-brained "manufactured men," and also for 
limning with a few brilliant lines 
the human characters whom the 
robots serve. 

The book opens with a completely charming and little-known story 
from a 1940 issue of Super-Science 
Stories, which tells about "Robbie" 
the robot-nursemaid. The rest of 
the tales, all from Astounding 
Science Fiction, carry the story 
through the crisis of human opposition to robots on earth, to the 
final point where computer-robots 
make wars and other human-occasioned catastrophes impossible. 

Unreservedly recommended. 

JOURNEY TO INFINITY, edited by Martin Greenberg, Gnome 
Press, New York, 1951. $3.50, 
381 pages. 

THIS collection of twelve novelets and short stories is an attempt to present the story of 
mankind from ancient times into 
the far-distant future. It is the second volume in Gnome's "Adventures in Science Fiction" series of 
anthologies, the first of which was 
Men Against the Stars. 

For the current collection, Greenberg has chosen tales by A. Bert


60 




 



ram Chandler, E. E. Smith, Fredric 
Brown, Theodore Sturgeon, Jack 
Williamson, John MacDonald, 
Isaac Asimov, C. L. Moore, Fritz 
Leiber, Cleve Cartmill, Judith Merril and Eric Frank Russell. In time, 
these stories conduct the reader 
from the origins of the Adam and 
Eve legend, in Chandler's magnificent "False Dawn," clear through 
to an immensely distant future in 
which man has mutated into a 
self-controlled atomic pile, in 
Russell's equally superb "Metamorphosite." 

Judged as a collection of science 
fiction stories, Journey to Infinity 
is somewhat uneven. Between the 
two stories which open and close 
the book are some which rate 
equally high — Sturgeon's "Unite 
and Conquer," for example, Asimov's "Mother Earth," and Cartmill's "Overthrow." Others are 
good of their kind, and a few are 
run-of-the-mill stuff. 

However, as an "idea" anthology, the notion of presenting science fiction's possible pasts and 
futures for man in a collection of 
short stories is a fascinating one, 
but the job cannot be effectively 
done in twelve stories. 

Anyone who is familiar with 
the rich store of science fiction in 
this particular field will feel a very 
definite sense of dissatisfaction 
with this slim collection. At least 
ten or a dozen more tales come to 
mind which would have greatly 
enriched and varied the picture of 



man's possible pasts and futures. 

Where, for example, is a chapter 
from the greatest of all histories 
of tomorrow, Robert Heinlein's ? 
(It is possible, of course, that 
Heinlein would not let any be 
used, since his "history" is alreadybeing published in several volumes 
by another publisher.) Or where 
is the essential "Baldy" story, from 
Lewis Padgett's excellent postatomic-war series? Or one of 
Simak's "City" tales? 

Despite too skeletal a form, 
Journey to Infinity is a good buy 
for anyone who likes top-grade 
science fiction. 

PRELUDE TO SPACE, by Arthur 
C. Clarke. Galaxy, New York, 
1951. 25tf, 160 pages. 

THIS genuinely effective "documentary of tomorrow," appearing for the first time anywhere as a 
Galaxy paper-bound book, tells the 
story of the organizational and logistics problems which must be 
solved before the first man-carrying rocket to - the moon can be 
launched. Realistically, and yet 
with a genuine feeling for the 
drama and the awe of the adventure, it takes you from the early, 
confusion-ridden- days of planning 
and training in London, clear 
through to the actual launching of 
the rocket from its five-mile-long 
track deep in the Australian desert. 

Recommended for readers whose 
taste goes beyond Perry Mason.

BETELGEUSE BRIDGE 



By WILLIAM TENN 



YOU tell them, Alvarez, old 
boy; you know how to talk 
to them. This isn't my kind 
of Public Relations. All I care about 
is that they get the pitch exactly 
right with all the implications and 
complications and everything just 
the way they really were. 

If it hurts, well, let them yell. 
Just use your words and get it 
right. Get it all. 

You can start with the day the 
alien spaceship landed outside 
Baltimore. Makes you sick to think 
how we never tumbled, doesn't it, 
Alvarez? No more than a hop, skip 
and a jet from the Capitol dome, 
and we thought it was just a lucky 
accident. 

Explain why we thought it was 
so lucky. Explain about the secrecy 
it made possible, how the farmer 
who telephoned the news was 
placed in special and luxurious custody, how a hand-picked cordon of 
M. P.s paced five square miles off 
into an emergency military reserva


tion a few hours later, how Congress was called into secret session 
and the way it was all kept out of 
the newspapers. 

How and why Trowson, my old 
sociology prof, was consulted once 
the problem became clear. How he 
blinked at the brass hats and striped 
pants and came up with the answer. 

Me. I was the answer. 

How my entire staff and I were 
plucked out of our New York offices, where we were quietly earning 
a million bucks, by a flying squad 
of the F. B. I. and air-mailed to 
Baltimore. Honestly, Alvarez, even 
after Trowson explained the situation to me, I was still irritated. Government hush-hush always makes 
me uncomfortable. Though I don't 
have to tell you how grateful I was 
for it later. 

The spaceship itself was such a 
big surprise that I didn't even wet 
my lips when the first of the aliens 
slooshed out. After all those years

When interstellar guests arrive, it's

us. A treat, however, not a treatment!

of streamlined cigar-shapes the 
Sunday Supplement artists had 
dreamed up, that colorful and rococo spheroid rearing out of a barley field in Maryland looked less 
like an interplanetary vessel than 
an oversized ornament for a whatnot table. Nothing that seemed like 
a rocket jet anywhere. 

"And there's your job," the prof 
pointed. "Those two visitors." 

They were standing on a flat 
metal plate surrounded by the highest the republic had elected or appointed. Nine feet of slimy green 
trunk tapering up from a rather 
wide base to a pointed top, and 
dressed in a tiny pink and white 
shell. Two stalks with eyes on them 
that swung this way and that, and 
seemed muscular enough to throttle 
a man. And a huge wet slash of a 
mouth that showed whenever an 
edge of the squirming base lifted 
from the metal plate. 

"Snails," I said. "Snails!" 

"Or slugs," Trowson amended. 
"Gastropodal molluscs in any 
case." He gestured at the roiling 
white bush of hair that sprouted 
from his head. "But, Dick, that 
vestigial bit of coiled shell is even 
less an evolutionary memento than 
this. They're an older — and smarter 
— race." 

"Smarter?" 

He nodded. "When our engineers got curious, they were very 
courteously invited inside to inspect 
the ship. They came out with their 
mouths hanging." 



I BEG AN to get uncomfortable. 
I ripped a small piece off my 
manicure. "Well, naturally, prof, 
if they're so alien, so different — " 

"Not only that. Superior. Get 
that, Dick, because it'll be very important in what you have to do. 
The best engineering minds that 
this country can assemble in a 
hurry are like a crowd of South Sea 
Islanders trying to analyze the rifle 
and compass from what they know 
of spears and windstorms. These 
creatures belong to a galaxy-wide 
civilization composed of races at 
least as advanced as they; we're a 
bunch of backward hicks in an unfrequented hinterland of space 
that's about to be opened to exploration. Exploitation, perhaps, if 
we can't measure up. We have to 
give a very good impression and 
we have to learn fast." 

A dignified official with a briefcase detached himself from the 
nodding, smiling group around the 
aliens and started for us. 

"Wbew!" I commented brilliantly. "1492, repeat performance." I 
thought for a moment, not too 
clearly. "But why send the army 
and navy after me? I'm not going 
to be able to read blueprints from 
• — from — " 

"Betelgeuse. Ninth planet of the 
star Betelgeuse. No, Dick, we've already had Dr. Warbury out here. 
They learned English from him 
in two hours, although he hasn't 
identified a word of theirs in three 
days! And people like Lopez, like 



64 




 



Mainzer, are going quietly psychotic trying to locate their power 
source. We have the best minds we 
can get to do the learning. Your 
job is different. We want you as a 
top-notch advertising man, a public 
relations executive. You're the 
good impression part of the program." 

The official plucked at my sleeve 
and I shrugged him away. "Isn't 
that the function of government 
glad-handers ?" I asked Trowson. 

"No. Don't you remember what 
you said when you first saw them? 
Snails! How do you think this 
country is going to take to the idea 
of snails — giant snails — who sneer 
condescendingly at our skyscraper 
cities, our atomic bombs, our most 
advanced mathematics? We're a 
conceited kind of monkey. Also, 
we're afraid of the dark." 

There was a gentle official tap on 
my shoulder. I said "Please!" impatiently. I watched the warm little 
breeze ruffle Professor Trowson's 
slept-in clothes and noticed the tiny 
red streaks in his weary eyes. 

"Mighty Monsters from Outer 
Space. Headlines like that, prof?" 

"Slugs with Superiority Complexes. Dirty Slugs, more likely. 
We're lucky they landed in this 
country, and so close to the Capitol, too. In a few days, we'll have 
to call in the heads of other nations. 
Then, sometime soon after, the 
news will be out. We don't want 
our visitors attacked by mobs 
drunk on superstition, planetary 



isolation or any other form of tabloid hysteria. We don't want them 
carrying stories back to their civilization of being shot at by a suspendered fanatic who screamed, 
'Go back where you come from, 
you furrin seafood!' We want to 
give them the impression that we 
are a fairly amiable, fairly intelligent race, that we can be dealt with 
reasonably well." 

I nodded. "Yeah. So they'll set 
up trading posts on this planet instead of garrisons. But what do I 
do in all this?" 

He punched my chest gently. 
"You, Dick — you do a job of public relations. You sell these aliens 
to the American people!" 

THE official had maneuvered 
around in front of me. I 
recognized him. He was the Undersecretary of State. 

"Would you step this way, 
please?" he said. "I'd like to introduce you to our distinguished 
guests." 

So he stepped, and I stepped, 
and we scrunched across the field 
and clanked across the steel plate 
and stood next to our gastropodic 
guests. 

"Ahem," said the Undersecretary politely. 

The nearer snail bent an eye toward us. The other eye drew a bead 
on the companion snail, and then 
the great slimy head arched and 
came down to our level. The creature raised, as it were, one cheek 



BETELGEUSE BRIDGE

of its foot and said, with all the 
mellowness of air being pumped 
through a torn inner tube, "Can it 
be that you wish to communicate 
with my unworthy self, respected 
sir?" 

I was introduced. The thing 
brought two eyes to bear on me. 
The place where its chin should 
have been dropped to my feet and 
snaked around there for a second. 
Then it said, "You, honored sir, 
are our touchstone, the link with 
all that is great in your noble race. 
Your condescension is truly a tribute." 

All this tumbled out while I was 
muttering "How," and extending a 
diffident hand. The snail put one 
eyeball in my palm and the other on 
the back of my wrist. It didn't 
shake; it just put the things there 
and took them away again. I had 
the wit not to wipe my hands on 
my pants, which was my immediate 
impulse. The eyeball wasn't exactly 
dry, either. 

I said, "I'll do my best. Tell me, 
are you — uh — ambassadors, sort 
of? Or maybe just explorers?" 

"Our small worth justifies no 
titles," said the creature, "yet we 
are both; for all communication is 
ambassadorship of a kind, and any 
seeker after knowledge is an explorer." 

I was suddenly reminded of an 
old story with the punchline, "Ask 
a foolish question and you get a 
foolish answer." I also wondered 
suddenly what snails eat. 



The second alien glided over and 
eyed me. "You may depend upon 
our utmost obedience," it said 
humbly. "We understand your 
awesome function and we wish to 
be liked to whatever extent it is 
possible for your admirable race to 
like such miserable creatures as ourselves." 

"Stick to that attitude and we'll 
get along," I said. 

BY AND large they were a 
pleasure to work with. I mean 
there was no temperament, no upstaging, no insistence on this 
camera angle or that mention of a 
previously published book or the 
other wishful biographical apocrypha about being raised in a convent, 
■like most of my other clients. 

On the other hand they weren't 
easy to talk to. They'd take orders, 
sure. But ask them a question. Any 
question: 

"How long did the trip take 
you?" 

" 'How long' in your eloquent 
tongue indicates a frame of reference dealing with duration. I hesitate to discuss so complex a problem with one as learned as yourself. 
The velocities involved make it 
necessary to answer in relative 
terms. Our lowly and undesirable 
planet recedes from this beauteous 
system during part of its orbital 
period, advances toward it during 
part. Also we must take into consideration the direction and velocity 
of our star in reference to the cos


66 




 



mic expansion of this portion of the 
continuum. Had we come from 
Cygnus, say, or Bootes, the question could be answered somewhat 
more directly; for those bodies 
travel in a contiguous arc skewed 
from the ecliptic plane in such a 
way that — " 

Or a question like, "Is your government a democracy?" 

"A democracy is a rule of the 
people, according to your rich etymology. We could not, in our lowly tongue, have expressed it so 
succinctly and movingly. One must 
govern oneself, of course. The degree of governmental control on 
the individual must vary from individual to individual and in the 
individual from time to time. This 
is so evident to as comprehensive a 
mind as yours that I trust you forgive me my inanities. The same 
control applies, naturally, to individuals considered in the mass. 
When faced with a universal necessity, the tendency exists among 
civilized species to unite to fill the 
need. Therefore, when no such 
necessity exists, there is less reason 
for concerted effort. Since this 
applies to all species, it applies even 
to such as us. On the other hand — " 

See what I mean ? A little of that 
got old quickly with me. I was 
happy to keep my nose to my own 
grindstone. 

THE government gave me a 
month for the preparatory 
propaganda. Originally, the story 



was to break in two weeks, but I 
got down on my hands and knees 
and bawled that a publicity deadline required at least five times that. 
So they gave me a month. 

Explain that carefully, Alvarez. I 
want them to understand exactly 
what a job I faced. All those years 
of lurid magazine covers showing 
extremely nubile females being 
menaced in three distinct colors by 
assorted monstrosities; those horror 
movies, those invasion-from-outerspace novels, those Sunday Supplement fright-splashes — all those 
sturdy psychological ruts I had to 
retrack. Not to mention the shudders elicited by mention of 
"worms," the regulation distrust of 
even human "furriners," the superstitious dread of creatures who had 
no visible place to park a soul. 

Trowson helped me round up the 
men to write the scientific articles, 
and I dug up the boys who could 
pseudo them satisfactorily. Magazine mats were ripped apart to make 
way for yarns speculating gently 
on how far extraterrestrial races 
might have evolved beyond us, how 
much more ethical they might have 
become, how imaginary seven-headed creatures could still apply the 
Sermon on the Mount. Syndicated 
features popped up describing 
"Humble Creatures Who Create 
our Gardens," "Snail-Racing, the 
Spectacular New Spectator Sport," 
and so much stuff on "The Basic 
Unity of all Living Things" that I 
began to get uncomfortable at even 



BETELGEUSE BRIDGE

a vegetarian dinner. I remember 
hearing there was a perceptible 
boom in mineral waters and vitamin 
pills. . . . 

And all this, mind you, without 
a word of the real story breaking. 
A columnist did run a cute and 
cryptic item about someone having 
finally foufid meat on the flying 
saucers, but half an hour of earnest discussion in an abandoned 
fingerprint-file room prejudiced 
him against further comment along 
this line. 

THE video show was the biggest 
problem. I don't think I could 
have done it on time with anything 
less than the resources and influence of the United States government behind me. But a week before 
the official announcement, I had 
both the video show and the comic 
strip in production. 

I think fourteen — though maybe 
it was more — of the country's best 
comedy writers collaborated on the 
project, not to mention the horde 
of illustrators and university psychologists nrho combined to sweat 
out the delightful little drawings. 
We used the drawings as the basis 
for the puppets on the TV show 
and I don't think anything was 
ever so gimmicked up with Popular Appeal — and I do mean 
Popular — as "Andy and Dandy." 

Those two fictional snails crept 
into the heart of America like a 
virus infection: overnight, everybody was talking about their anthro


pomorphic antics, repeating their 
quotable running gags and adjuring 
each other not to miss the next 
show. ("You can't miss it, Steve; 
it's on every channel anyway. Right 
after supper.") I had the tie-ins, 
too: Andy and Dandy dolls for the 
girls, snail scooters for the boys, 
everything from pictures on cocktail glasses to kitchen decalcomanias. Of course, a lot of the tie-ins 
didn't come off the production line 
till after the Big Announcement. 

When we gave the handouts to 
the newspapers, we "suggested" 
what headlines to use. They had a 
choice of ten. Even the New York 
Times was forced to shriek "REAL 
ANDY AND DANDY BLOW IN 
FROM BETELGEUSE," and under that a four-column cut of 
blonde Baby Ann Joyce with the 
snails. 

Baby Ann had been flown out 
from Hollywood for the photograph. The cut showed her standing between the two aliens and 
clutching an eye-stalk of each in 
her trusting, chubby hands. 

The nicknames stuck. Those two 
slimy intellectuals from another 
star became even more important 
than the youthful evangelist who 
was currently being sued for bigamy. 

Andy and Dandy had a tickertape reception in New York. They 
obligingly laid a cornerstone for the 
University of Chicago's new library. They posed for the newsreels everywhere, surrounded by 



68 




 



Florida oranges, Idaho potatoes, 
Milwaukee beer. They were magnificently cooperative. 

F.OM time to time, I wondered 
what they thought of us. They 
had no facial expressions, which 
was scarcely odd since they had no 
faces. Their long eye-stalks swung 
this way and that as they rode down 
shrieking Broadway in the back 
seat of the Mayor's car; their gelatinous body-foot would heave 
periodically and the mouth under it 
make a smacking noise, but when 
the photographers suggested that 
they curl around the barely clad 
beauties, the time video rigged up 
a Malibu Beach show, Andy and 
Dandy wriggled over and complied 
without a word. Which is more 
than I can say for the barely clad 
beauties. 

And when the winning pitcher 
presented them with an autographed 
baseball at that year's World Series, 
they bowed gravely, their pink shelltops glistening in the sunlight, and 
said throatily into the battery of 
microphones: "We're the happiest 
fans in the universe!" 

The country went wild over 
them. 

"But we can't keep them here," 
Trowson predicted. "Did you read 
about the debate in the U. N. General Assembly yesterday? We were 
accused of making secret alliances 
with non-human aggressors against 
the best interests of our own species." 



I shrugged. "Well, let them go 
overseas. I don't think anyone else 
will be more successful extracting 
information from them than we 
were." 

Professor Trowson wriggled his 
short body up on a corner of his 
desk. He lifted a folderful of typewritten notes and grimaced as if his 
tongue were wrapped in wool. 

"Four months of careful questioning," he grumbled. "Four 
months of painstaking interrogation 
by trained sociologists using every 
free moment the aliens had, which 
admittedly wasn't much. Four 
months of organized investigation, 
of careful data-sifting." He dropped 
the folder disgustedly to the desk 
and some of the pages splashed 
out. "And we know more about 
the social structure of Atlantis than 
Betelgeuse IX." 

We were in the wing of the Pentagon assigned to what the brass 
hats, in their own cute way, had 
christened Project Encyclopedia. I 
strolled across the large, sunny 
office and glanced at the very latest 
organizational wall-chart. I pointed 
to a small rectangle labeled "Power 
Source Sub-Section" depending via 
a straight line from a larger rectangle marked "Alien Physical 
Science Inquiry Section." In the 
small rectangle, very finely printed, 
were the names of an army major, 
a WAC corporal, and Drs. Lopez, 
Vinthe and Mainzer. 

"How' re they doing?" I asked. 

"Not much better, I'm afraid." 



BETELGEUSE BRIDGE 



69 



Trowson turned away with a sigh 
from peering over my shoulder. "At 
least, I deduce that from the unhappy way Mainzer bubbles into his 
soup spoon at lunch. Conversation 
between sub-sections originating in 
different offices on the departmental 
level is officially discouraged, you 
know. But I remember Mainzer 
from the university cafeteria. He 
bubbled into his soup the very same 
way when he was stuck on his solar 
refraction engine." 

"mHINK Andy and Dandy are 
JL afraid we're too young to 
play with matches? Or maybe apelike creatures are too unpleasantlooking to be allowed to circulate 
in their refined and esthetic civilization ?" 

"I don't know. Dick." The prof 
ambled back to his desk and leafed 
irritably through his sociological 
notes. "If anything like that is true, 
why would they give us free run 
of their ship? Why would they 
reply so gravely and courteously to 
every question? If only their answers weren't so vague in our 
terms! But they are such complex 
and artistically minded creatures, so 
chockful of poetic sentiment and 
good manners that it's impossible 
to make mathematical or even verbal sense out of their vast and 
circumlocutory explanations. Sometimes, when I think of their highly 
polished manners and their seeming 
lack of interest in the structure of 
their society, when I put that to


gether with their spaceship which 
looks like one of those tiny jade 
carvings that took a lifetime to accomplish . . ." 

He trailed off and began riffling 
the pages like a Mississippi steamboat gambler going over somebody 
else's deck of cards. 

"Isn't it possible we just don't 
have enough stuff as yet to understand them?" 

"Yes. In fact, that's what we always come back to. Warbury 
points to the tremendous development in our language since the advent of technical vocabularies. He 
says that this process, just beginning with us, already affects our 
conceptual approach as well as our 
words. And, naturally, in a race so 
much further along — But if we 
could only find a science of theirs 
which bears a faint resemblance to 
one of ours!" 

I felt sorry for him, standing 
there blinking futilely out of gentle, 
academic eyes. 

"Cheer up, prof. Maybe by the 
time old Suckfoot and his pal come 
back from the Grand Tour, you'll 
have unsnarled a sophistry and we'll 
be off this 'Me, friend; you come 
from across sea in great bird with 
many wings' basis that we seemed 
to have wandered into." 

And there you are, Alvarez: a 
cheap advertising smallbrain like 
me, and I was that close. I should 
have said something then. Bet you 
wouldn't have nodded at me heavily 
and said, "I hope so, Dick. I des

perately hope so." But, come to 
think of it, not only Trowson was 
trotting up that path. So was Warbury. So were Lopez, Vinthe and 
Mainzer. So was I, among others. 

I HAD a chance to relax when 
Andy and Dandy went abroad. 
My job wasn't exactly over, but the 
Public Relations end was meshing 
right along, with me needed only 
once in a while to give a supervisory spin. Chiefly, I maintained 
close contact with my opposite 
number in various other sovereign 
states, giving out with experienced 
advice on how to sell the Boys from 
Betelgeuse. They had to adjust it to 
their own mass phobias and popular myths; but they were a little 
happier about it than I had been, 
without any clear idea of what public behavior to expect of our visitors. 

Remember, when I'd started, I 
hadn't even been sure those snails 
were housebroken. 

I followed them in the newspapers. I pasted the pictures of the 
Mikado receiving them next to 
their nice comments on the Taj 
Mahal. They weren't nearly so nice 
to the Akhund of Swat; but, then, 
when you think of what the Akhund said about them — 

They tended to do that everywhere, giving just a little better 
than they got. For example, when 
they were presented with those 
newly created decorations in Red 
Square (Dandy got The Order of 



Extraterrestrial Friends of Soviet 
Labor, while, for some abstruse 
reason, The Order of Heroic Interstellar Champion of the Soviet People was conferred upon Andy), 
they came out with a long, ringing 
speech about the scientific validity 
of communist government. It made 
for cheering, flower-tossing crowds 
in the Ukraine and Poland, but a 
certain amount of restiveness in 
these United States. 

But before I had to run my staff 
into overtime hours, whipping up 
press releases which recapitulated 
the aliens' statement before the 
joint houses of Congress and their 
lovely, sentimental comments at 
Valley Forge, the aliens were in 
Berne, telling the Swiss that only 
free enterprise could have produced 
the yodel, the Incabloc escapement 
in watches, and such a superb .example of liberty; hadn't they had 
democracy long enough to have had 
it first, and wasn't it wonderful? 

By the time they reached Paris, 
I had the national affection pretty 
much under control again, although 
here and there a tabloid still muttered peevishly in its late city final. 
But, as always, Andy and Dandy 
put the clincher on. Even then I 
wondered whether they really liked 
DeRoges' latest abstraction for itself alone. 

But they bought the twisted 
sculpture, paying for it, since they 
had no cash of their own, with a 
thumb-sized gadget which actually 
melted marble to any degree of 



BETELGEUSE BRIDGE 



71 



pattern-delicacy the artist desired, 
merely by being touched to the appropriate surface. DeRoges threw 
away his chisels blissfully, but six 
of the finest minds in France retired to intensive nervous breakdowns after a week of trying to 
solve the tool's working principles. 
It went over big here: 

ANDY AND DANDY PAY 
AS THEY GO 

Betelgeuse Business Men 
Show Appreciation for 
Value Received 

This newspaper notes with 
pleasure the sound shopper's 
ethics behind the latest transaction of our distinguished 
guests from the elemental void. 
Understanding the inexorable 
law of supply and demand, 
these representatives of an advanced economic system refuse 
to succumb to the 'gimmies.' 
If certain other members of 
the human race were to examine carefully the true implications of . . . 

SO WHEN they returned to the 
United States after being presented at the British Court, they 
got juicy spreads in all the newspapers, a tug-whistle reception in 
New York harbor and the mayor's 
very chiefest deputy there on City 
Hall steps to receive them. 

And even though people were 
more or less accustomed to them 
now, they were somehow never 



shoved off page one. There was the 
time a certain furniture polish got 
a testimonial out of them in which 
the aliens announced that they'd 
had particularly happy and glossy 
results on their tiny shell toppers 
with the goo; and they used the 
large financial rewards of the testimonial to buy ten extremely rare 
orchids and have them sunk in plastic. And there was the time — 

I missed the television show on 
which it broke. I had gone to a 
sidestreet movie theater that night 
to see a revival of one of my favorite Chaplin pictures; and I'd never 
enjoyed the ostentatious greet-thegreat hysterics of Celebrity Salon 
anyway. I hadn't any idea of how 
long the m.c, Bill Bancroft, had 
waited to get Andy and Dandy on 
his program, and how much he 
was determined to make it count 
when the big night arrived. 

Reconstructed and stripped of 
meaningless effusion, it went something like this: 

Bancroft asked them if they 
weren't anxious to get home to the 
wife and kiddies. Andy explained 
patiently, for perhaps the thirtyfourth time, that, since they were 
hermaphrodites, they had no family 
in any humanly acceptable sense. 
Bancroft cut into the explanation 
to ask them what ties they did 
have. Chiefly the revitalizer, says 
Andy politely. 

Revitalizer? What's a revitalizer? 
Oh, a machine they have to expose 
themselves to every decade or so, 



72 




 



says Dandy. There's at least one 
revitalize! in every large city on 
their home planet. 

Bancroft makes a bad pun, waits 
for the uproarious audience to regain control, then asks: And this 
revitalizer — just what does it do? 
Andy goes into a long-winded explanation, the gist of which is that 
the revitalizers stir up cytoplasm in 
all animal cells and refresh them. 

I see, cracks Bancroft; the pause 
every decade that refreshes. And 
then, after being refreshed, you 
have what as a result? "Oh," muses 
Dandy, "you might say we have no 
fear of cancer or any degenerative 
disease. Besides that, by exposing 
ourselves to revitalizers at regular 
intervals throughout our lifetime 
and refreshing our body cells, we 
quintuple our life expectancy. We 
live five times longer than we 
should. That's about what the revitalizer does, you might say," says 
Dandy. Andy, after thinking a bit, 
agrees. "That's about it." 

Pandemonium, and not mild. 
Newspaper extras in all languages, 
including the Scandinavian. Lights 
burning late at night in the U. N. 
Headquarters with guards twenty 
deep around the site. 

When President of the Assembly 
Sadhu asked them why they'd never 
mentioned revitalizers before, they 
did the snail equivalent of shrugging and said the Betelgeuse IX 
equivalent of nobody ever asked 
them. 

President Sadhu cleared his 



throat, waved all complications 
aside with his long brown fingers 
and announced, "That is not important. Not now. We must have 
revitalizers." 

It seemed to take the aliens a 
while to understand that. When 
they finally became convinced that 
we, as a species, were utterly entranced with the prospect of two 
to four centuries of life instead of 
fifty or sixty years, they went into 
a huddle. 

BUT their race didn't make these 
machines for export, they explained regretfully. Just enough to 
service their population. And, while 
they could see as how we might 
like and must obviously deserve to 
have these gadgets, there was none 
to ferry back from Betelgeuse. 

Sadhu didn't even look around 
for advice. "What would your people want?" he asked. "What 
would they like in exchange for 
manufacturing these machines for 
us? We will pay almost any price 
within the power of this entire 
planet." A rumbling, eager "yes" 
in several languages rolled across 
the floor of the Assembly. 

Andy and Dandy couldn't think 
of a thing. Sadhu begged them to 
try. He personally escorted them to 
their spaceship, which was now 
parked in a restricted area in Central Park. "Good night, gentlemen," said President of the 
Assembly Sadhu. "Try— please try 
hard to think of an exchange."

They stayed inside their ship for 
almost six days while the world almost went insane with impatience. 
When I think of all the fingernails 
bitten that week by two billion people . . . 

"Imagine!" Trowson whispered 
to me. He was pacing the floor as 
if he fully intended to walk all the 
way to Betelgeuse. "We'd just be 
children on a quintupled life-scale, 
Dick. All my achievement and 
education, all yours, would be just 
the beginning! A man could learn 
five professions in such a life — and 
think what he could accomplish in 
one!" 

I nodded, a little numb. I was 
thinking of the books I could read, 
the books I might write, if the bulk 
of my life stretched ahead of me 
and the advertising profession was 
just a passing phase in the beginning of it. Then, again, somehow 
I'd never married, never had had 
a family. Not enough free time, I 
had felt. And now, at forty, I was 
too set in my ways. But a man can 
unset a lot in a century — 

In six days the aliens came out. 
With a statement of price. 

They believed they could persuade their people to manufacture 

a supply of revitalizers for us if 

An IF writ very large indeed. 

Their planet was woefully short 
of radioactive minerals, they explained apologetically. Barren 
worlds containing radium, uranium 
and thorium had been discovered 
and claimed by other races, but the 



folk of Betelgeuse IX were forbidden by their ethics to wage aggressive war for territorial purposes. 
We had plenty of radioactive ore, 
which we used chiefly for war and 
biological research. The former 
was patently undesirable and the 
latter would be rendered largely 
unnecessary by the revitalizers. 

So, in exchange, they wanted our 
radioactive elements. All of them, 
they stated humbly. 

ALL right, we were a little surprised, even stunned. But the 
protests never started to materialize. There was an overwhelming 
chorus of "sold!" from every quadrant of the globe. A couple of generals here, a few militaristic 
statesmen there managed to raise 
direly pointing forefingers before 
they were whisked out of position. 
A nuclear physicist or two howled 
about the future of sub-atomic research, but the peoples of the earth 
howled louder. 

"Research? How much research 
can you do in a lifetime of three 
hundred years?" 

Overnight, the United Nations 
became the central office of a planetwide mining concession. National 
boundaries were superseded by 
pitchblende deposits and swords 
were beaten into pickaxes. Practically anyone with a good, usable arm 
enlisted in the shovel brigades for 
two or more months out of the year. 
Camaraderie flew on the winds of 
the world. 



74 




 



Andy and Dandy politely offered 
to help. They marked out on detail 
contour maps the spots to be mined, 
and that included areas never suspected of radioactivity. They supplied us with fantastic but clear 
line-drawings of devices for extracting the stuff from the ores in which 
it assayed poorly, and taught us the 
exact use of these devices, if not 
their basic principle. 

They hadn't been joking. They 
wanted it all. 

Then, when everything was running smoothly, they buzzed off for 
Betelgeuse to handle their part of 
the bargain. 

THOSE two years were the most 
exhilarating of my life. 
And I'd say everyone feels the 
same, don't they, Alvarez? The 
knowledge that the world was 
working together, cheerfully, happily, for life itself. I put my year in 
at The Great Slave Lake and I 
don't think anyone of my age and 
weight lifted more pitchblende. 

Andy and Dandy came back in 
two huge ships, manned by weird 
snail-like robots. The robots did 
everything, while Andy and Dandy 
went on being lionized. From the 
two ships, almost covering the sky, 
the robots ferried back and forth in 
strange, spiral aircraft, bringing revitalizes down, carrying refined 
radioactive elements aloft. No one 
paid the slightest attention to their 
methods of instantaneous extraction 
from large quantities of ore: we 



were interested in just one throbbing thought — the revitalizers. 

They worked. And that, so far as 
most of us were concerned, was 
that. 

The revitalizers worked. Cancer 
disappeared; heart disease and kidney disease immediately arrested. 
Insects which were introduced into 
the square one-story lab structures 
lived for a year instead of a few 
months. And humans — doctors 
shook their heads in wonder over 
people who had gone through. 

All over the planet, near every 
major city, the long, patient, slowly moving lines stood outside the 
revitalizers, which were rapidly 
becoming something else. 

"Temples!" shouted Mainzer. 
"They look on them as temples. 
A scientist investigating their operation is treated like a dangerous 
lunatic in a nursery by the attendants. Not that a man can find a 
clue in those ridiculously small motors. I no longer ask what their 
power source can be — instead, I ask 
if they have a power source at all!" 

"The revitalizers are very precious now, in the beginning," Trowson soothed him. "After a while, 
the novelty will wear off and you'll 
be able to investigate at your 
leisure. Could it be solar power?" 

"No!" Mainzer shook his huge 
head positively. "Not solar power 
— solar power I am sure I could 
recognize. As I am sure that the 
power supply of their ships and 
whatever runs these — these revital


BETELGEUSE BRIDGE 



75 



izers are two entirely separate 
things. On the ships I have given 
up. But the revitalizers I believe I 
could solve. If only they would let 
me examine them. Fools! So terribly afraid I might damage one, 
and they would have to travel to 
another city for their elixir!" 

We patted his shoulder, but we 
weren't really interested. Andy and 
Dandy left that week, after wishing 
us well in their own courteous and 
complex fashion. Whole population 
groups blew kisses at their mineralladen ships. 

Six months after they left, the 
revitalizers stopped. 

"AMI CERTAIN? Trowson 
JiX. snorted at my dismayed face. 
"One set of statistics proves it: 
look at your death rate. It's back to 
pre-Betelgeuse normal. Or ask any 
doctor. Any doctor who can forget 
his U. N. security oath, that is. 



There'll be really wild riots when 
the news breaks, Dick." 

"But why?" I asked him. "Did 
we do something wrong?" 

He started a laugh that ended 
with his teeth clicking frightenedly 
together. He rose and walked to 
the window, staring out into the 
star-diseased sky. "We did something wrong, all right. We trusted. 
We made the same mistake all natives have made when they met a 
superior civilization. Mainzer and 
Lopez have taken one of the revitalizer engine units apart. There 
was just a trace of it left, but this 
time they found the power source. 
Dick, my boy, the revitalizers were 
run on the fuel' of completely pure 
radioactive elements!" 

I needed a few moments to file 
that properly. Then I sat down in 
the easy chair very, very carefully. 
I made some hoarse, improbable 
sounds before croaking: "Prof, do 



76 




 



BETELGEUSE BRIDGE 77 



you mean they wanted that stuff 
for themselves, for their own revitalizers? That everything they did 
on this planet was carefully 
planned so that they could con us 
with a maximum of friendliness all 
around ? It doesn't seem — it just 
can't — why, with their superior 
science, they could have conquered 
us if they'd cared to. They could 
have — " 

"No, they couldn't have," Trowson whipped out. He turned to face 
me and flung his arms across each 
other. "They're a decadent, dying 
race; they wouldn't have attempted 
to concjuer us. Not because of their 
ethics — this huge, horrible swindle 
serves to illustrate that aspect of 
them — but because they haven't the 
energy, the concentration, the interest. Andy and Dandy are probably representative of the few remaining who have barely enough 
git-up-and-go to trick backward 
peoples out of the all-important, 
life-sustaining revitalizer fuel." 

The implications were just beginning to soak in my cortex. Me, 
the guy who did the most complete 
and colossal public relations job of 
all time — I could just see what my 
relations with the public would be 
like if I was ever connected with 
this shambles. 

"And without atomic power, 
prof, we won't have space travel!" 

He gestured bitterly. "Oh, we've 
been taken, Dick; the whole human 
race has been had. I know what 
you're going through, but think of 



me! I'm the failure, the man responsible. I'm supposed to be a' 
sociologist! How could I have 
missed? Hon? It was all there: the 
lack of interest in their own culture, the overintellectualization of 
esthetics, the involved methods of 
thought and expression, the exag- . 
gerated etiquette, even the very first 
thing of theirs we saw — their ship 
— was too heavily stylized and intricately designed for a young, 
thrusting civilization. 

"They had to be decadent; every 
sign pointed to that conclusion. 
And, of course, the fact that they 
resort to the methods of fueling 
their revitalizers that we've experienced — when if we had their 
science, what might we not do, 
what substitutes might we not develop! No wonder they couldn't 
explain their science to us; I doubt 
if they understand it fully themselves. They are the profligate, inadequate and sneak-thief heirs of 
what was once a soaring race!" 

I WAS following my own unhappy images. "And we're still 
hicks. Hicks who've been sold the 
equivalent of the Brooklyn Bridge 
by some dressed-up sharpies from 
Betelgeu.se." 

Trowson nodded. "Or a bunch 
of poor natives who have sold their 
island home to a group of European 
explorers for a handful of brightly 
colored glass beads." 

But of course we were both 
wrong, Alvarez. Neither Trowson 



78 




 



nor I had figured on Mainzer or 
Lopez or the others. Like Mainzer 
said, a few years earlier and we 
would have been licked. But Man 
had entered the atomic age sometime before 1945 and people like 
Mainzer and Vinthe had done nuclear research back in the days when 
radioactive elements abounded on 
Earth. We had that and we had 
such tools as the cyclotron, the betatron. And, if our present company 
will pardon the expression, Alvarez, we are a young and vigorous 
race. 

All we had to do was the necessary research. 

The research was • done. With a 
truly effective world government, 
with a population not only interested in the problem, but recently 
experienced in working together — 
and with the grim incentive we 
had, Alvarez — the problem, as you 
know, was solved. 

We developed artificial radioactives and refueled the revitalizers. 
We developed atomic fuels out of 
the artificial radioactives and we got 
space travel. We did it comparatively fast, and we weren't inter


ested in a ship that just went to the 
Moon or Mars. We wanted a star 
ship. And we wanted it so bad, so 
fast, that we have it now, too. 

Here we are. Explain the situation to them, Alvarez, just the way 
I told it to you, but with all the 
knee-bending and gobbledegook 
that a transplanted Brazilian with 
twelve years Oriental trading experience can put into it. You're the 
man to do it — I can't talk like that. 
It's the only language those decadent slugs understand, so it's the 
only way we can talk to them. So 
talk to them, these slimy snails, 
these oysters on the quarter shell, 
these smart-alecky slugs. Don't forget to mention to them that the 
supply of radioactives they got from 
us won't last forever. Get that down 
in fine detail. 

Then stress the fact that we've 
got artificial radioactives, and that 
they've got some things we know 
we want and lots of other things we 
mean to find out about. 

Tell them, Alvarez, that we've 
come to collect tolls on that Brooklyn Bridge they sold us.

It was the voice that always

I. THE UNSPEAKABLE 



Month IX, New Century Three. 
My morning nuro-tablets had already popped from the tube, and 
the timer had begun to boil an egg. 
The egg was there because the 
realfood allotment had been increased last month. The balance of 
trade with Southern had just swung 
a decimal or two our way. 

I rose finally, stepped to the mirror, switched it to positive and 
looked at myself. New wrinkles — 
or maybe just a deepening of the 
old ones. It was beginning to 
show; the past two years were leaving traces. 

I hadn't worried about my appearance when I'd been with the 
Office of Weapons. There, I'd been 
able to keep pretty much to myself, 
doing research on magnetic mechanics as applied to space drive. But 
other jobs, where you had to be 
among people, might be different. 
I needed every possible thing in my 
favor. 

Yes, I still hoped for a job, 
even after two years. I still meant 
to keep on plugging, making the 
rounds. 

I'd go out again today. 

The timer clicked and my egg 
was ready. I swallowed the tablets 
and then took the egg to the table 
to savor it and make it last. 

As I leaned forward to sit, the 
metal tag dangled from my neck, 
catching the glowlight. My identity 
tag. 

Everything came back in a 
rush — 



My name. The dream and her 
voice. And her suggestion. 

Would I dare? Would I start out 
this very morning and take the risk, 
the terrible risk? 

YOU remember renumbering. 
Two years ago. You remember 
how it was then; how everybody 
looked forward to his new designation, and how everybody made 
jokes about the way the letters came 
out, and how all the records were 
for a while fouled up beyond recognition. 

The telecomics kidded renumbering. One went a little too far and 
they psycho-scanned him and then 
sent him to Marscol as a dangerous 
nonconform. 

If you were disappointed with 
your new designation, you didn't 
complain. You didn't want a sudden visit from the Deacons during 
the night. 

There had to be renumbering. 
We all understood that. With the 
population of Northern already past 
two billion, the old designations 
were too clumsy. Renumbering was 
efficient. It contributed to the good 
of Northern. It helped advance the 
warless struggle with Southern. 

The equator is the boundary. I 
understand that once there was a 
political difference and that the two 
superstates sprawled longitudinally, 
not latitudinally, over the globe. 
Now they are pretty much the 
same. There is the truce, and they 
are both geared for war. They are 



82 




 



both efficient states, as tightly controlled as an experiment with 
enzymes, as microsurgery, as the 
temper of a diplomat. 

We were renumbered, then, in 
Northern. You know the system: 
everybody now has six digits and 
an additional prefix or suffix of four 
letters. Stateleader, for instance, 
has the designation AAAA111/111. Now, to address somebody by calling off four letters is a 
little clumsy. We try to pronounce 
them when they are pronounceable. 
That is, no one says to Stateleader, 
"Good morning, A- A- A- A." They 
say, "Good morning, Aaaa." 

Reading the last quote, I notice a 
curious effect. It says what I feel. 
Of course I didn't feel that way on 
that particular morning. I was still 
conformal; the last thing in my 
mind was that I would infract and 
be psycho-scanned. 

Four letters then, and in many 
cases a pronounceable four letter 
word. 

A four letter word. 

Yes, you suspect already. You 
know what a four letter word can 
be. 

Mine was. 

It was unspeakable. 

The slight weight on my forehead reminded me that I still wore 
my sleep-learner. I'd been studying 
administrative cybernetics, hoping 
to qualify in that field, although it 
was a poor substitute for a space 
drive expert. I removed the band 
and stepped across the room and 



turned off the oscillator. I went 
back to my egg and my bitter memories. 

I will never forget the first day I 
received my new four letter combination and reported it to my chief, 
as required. I was unthinkably embarrassed. He didn't say anything. 
He just swallowed and choked and 
became crimson when he saw it. He 
didn't dare pass it to his secretarial 
engineer; he went to the administrative circuits and registered it 
himself. 

I can't blame him for easing me 
out. He was trying to run an efficient organization, after all, and no 
doubt I upset its efficiency. My 
work was important — magnetic mechanics was the only way to handle 
quanta reaction, or the so-called 
non-energy drive, and was therefore the answer to feasible space 
travel beyond our present limit of 
Mars — and there were frequent inspection tours by Big Wheels and 
Very Important Persons. 

Whenever anyone, especially a 
woman, asked my name, the embarrassment would become a crackling 
electric field all about us. The best 
tactic was just not to answer. 




HE chief called me in one day. 
He looked haggard. 



"Er — old man," he said, not quite 
able to bring himself to utter my 
name, "I'm going to have to switch 
you to another department. How 
would you like to work on nutrition 
kits? Very interesting work."

her, seeing her young figure and 
her light hair and her mouse-colored eyes, and not really knowing 
why. 

I had the overpowering desire 
to spring forward and throttle the 
two Deacons and help the prisoners to escape. Almost overpowering. I didn't, naturally. 

The jetcopter lowered toward 
the great green parks that cover the 
topside area of Center One. It was 
really refreshing to see them. I 
understood that the lucky residents 
of Center One were allowed to 
wander in these parks, and look at 
the growing things and the sky. 
Then, presently, the parks were out 
of sight again and we were settling 
on the concrete landing stage and 
I was back to reality. 

THE first contact at the Office 
of Pyschological Adjustment 
was, as usual, an information desk. 
There were people instead of cybs 
to greet you and I suppose that was 
because of the special complications 
of problems brought here. The 
cybs have their limits, after all. 

A gray man with a gray eye and 
a face like a mimeographed bulletin 
looked at me and said, in approved 
voice and standard phraseology, 
"what information is desired?" 
I told him. 

His eyebrows rose, as if suddenly buoyant. "Change your name? 
That's impossible." 

I quoted, verse and chapter, the 
regulation covering it. "H'm," he 



said. His eyebrows came down, 
cuddling into a scowl. "Well, 
that's highly unusual procedure. 
Better let me see your identity tag." 

I gave that to him and he saw 
my N/P status, and then my unspeakable name, and his eyebrows 
went up again. 

"Perhaps you'd better get this 
straightened out with General Administration first," he said. He 
scribbled a slip of paper, showing 
me how to get there. 

The rat race was on. 

I found General Administration. 
They sent me to Activity Control. 
Activity Control said they couldn't 
do a thing until I was registered. I 
went to Registration. Registration 
said oh, no, I shouldn't have been 
sent there — although they'd try to 
direct me to the proper office if I 
got an okay from Investigation and 
Security. I. & S. said the regulation 
I quoted had been amended and 
I would have to have the amendment first and I could find that in 
Records. Records sent me back to 
the first place to get a Search Permit. 

And so on. 

I kept at it doggedly. Toward 
the end of the day my legs ached 
and head felt like a ball of granite. 
I had discovered that Opsych had 
nearly as many levels and tunnels 
and bays as Center Four in its entirety, and I had taken the intercom 
cars when possible, but most of it 
had been walking. I tightened my 
jaw and pulled my stomach in. I'd

get to see the Chief if it took me 
a year. 

That was hyperbole, of course. 
No man could last a year walking 
those dim, monotonous, aseptic corridors. How can I describe the 
feeling? The corridors are the same 
wherever you go. The glowlight 
comes steadily, unblinkingly, from 
the walls. The color is a dead oyster 
white. 

There is always the feeling of 
being lost — even when you know, 
or think you know, exactly where 
you are. 

IT WAS near the end of the day 
and I was back at the information desk. 

"You again," said the gray man 
with the gray eye. 

"Records says I need a Search 
Permit. I have to find an amendment on the regulation covering 
my case." 

"Why don't you just give up? 
You're causing us a great deal of 
trouble, you know. We have other 
work to do. Important work." 

"So have I. I'm a magnetic mechanics expert. I could be working 
for the State right now if I could 
get a post. I can't get a post till my 
name's changed." 
"That's ridiculous." 
"I agree. But it's true just the 
same." • 

"Well, here's your Search Permit. But I still think you'd be wiser 
to forget it. And you'd save us a 
lot of fuss." 



I leaned across the desk. "You 
could save the whole organization a lot of fuss if you'd direct 
me to the Chief's office. Then I 
could take my case up with him 
directly. I've been keeping my eye 
open for it, but I can't find it anywhere, and of course nobody' 11 direct me there, even if they know 
where it is." 

He stared at me with mild 
horror. "Go direct to the Chief's 
office? Without going through 
channels?" 

"Well, that's what I had in 
mind." 

"Then you'd better get it out of 
your mind. That's pretty dangerous 
thinking. That's close to infraction." 

"All right." I sighed. TU do 
it the hard way." I took the Search 
Permit and went back to Records. 
I was still searching for the amendment when closing time came. 

I went back into the dim white 
corridors and found a foodmat, got 
some nuro-pills and reviewed the 
day. These workers here in Center 
One were experts at putting you 
off. They were much more skilful 
than the officials in Center Four. 
Maybe that was why they were in 
Center One. Maybe I never would 
wear them down. 

That thought came along and 
formed a ball of ice right in the 1 
bottom of my stomach. 

I had to think. I had to think 
and rest. Real air and a night breeze 
would help. 



I, THE UNSPEAKABLE 



95 



I found a shaft and went topside. 

I started walking along a winding trail in the great park. The stars 
were out. They were diamonds, 
ground to dust, and thrown carelessly across the black velvet of the 
sky. The moon had not yet risen. 
There was a breeze, cool and light, 
and it brought temporary sanity. At 
least it helped me realize I was 
tired. 

I came to a little brook, and, instead of crossing the foot bridge, I 
turned and followed the brook upstream. It led through groves of 
trees and presently I found a little 
clearing where the bank sloped 
gently and was covered with soft 
moss. At the water's edge, the bank 
and a rock formation made a kind 
of overhanging ledge and I sat on 
this a while and stared at the water, 
liquid silver, tumbling below. 

Finally I moved up the bank a 
little, wrapped my cloak around me 
and lay down. I looked at the stars. 
I wondered which one might be 
Mars. It was red, I'd heard, but I 
saw nothing like that. Probably it 
wasn't visible now. I got to thinking about Mars, and I got to thinking about the prison colony there, 
and then I got to thinking about 
the primitive life, and then freemating. 

That made me think of Lara, and 
her firm body and long, clean 
limbs and blonde hair and mousecolored eyes. 

I drifted off to sleep. Lara 



stayed with me; she stepped into 
my dream. It was a wonderful 
dream. Her voice, when' she broke 
from standard, was thrilling and 
delicious. It was linked with the 
tumbling of the brook somehow. 
She was warm and vibrant in my 
arms. She was alive, so alive. She 
was all movement. 

We were laughing together 
and . . . 

I AWOKE to the sound of shooting. 

The moon had risen and the 
broad glades were silver green and 
the trees were casting shadows. 
Voices were barking back and forth 
within the woods. 

"Over that way!" called one. 

"Cut 'em off! Cut 'em off!" 
yelled another. 

A man and woman, both entirely naked, both speckled with 
wounds and bruises, all standard 
in questioning, stumbled into the 
clearing. Their eyes were wild, big 
for their faces. They were thin. 
They gasped for breath. They 
looked around them, rats in mazes, 
and then saw me. 

They drew back. 

"This way!" called a voice from 
the wood. 

Another shot rang out. 

I stared at the man and woman, 
still too surprised to know what to 
do or say. 

They were the two prisoners I 
had seen in the jetcopter on my 
way to Center One. 



96 




 



IV 

MAYBE I was not quite awake. 
Maybe I was not really 
bright, though everybody thinks of 
himself as bright, I suppose. Maybe it was everything that had happened since the renumbering. 
Maybe I was fed up and maybe 
something about the quiet woods 
called out: Rebel! Rebel! 
I don't know. 

I pointed to the brook, the overhanging bank, and said, "In there! 
Quick!" 

They scuttled. They passed me 
and looked at me half-thankfully, 
half-fearfully. 

The voices came nearer. 

"Come on! This way! They can't 
get far!" 

I wrapped myself in my cloak 
and sat down and pretended to be 
gazing at the stars. 

A moment later three Deacons 
burst upon the clearing. I turned 
slowly, and stared at them, showing mild artificial surprise. Handsome, burly fellows. The one in the 
middle was a positive Apollo; I 
was sure that he waved his hair. 
He glared at me. 

"You," he said. 

"Me?" 

"Yes, you. What are you doing 
here?" 

I said, "I'm sitting here." 
"What for?" ' 

"The night air. To study the 
stars. Get a change of scene." I 
shrugged. 



Apollo stepped forward and held 
out his hand. "Your tag." 

This was it. When he saw my 
four letter name he'd really start 
working on me. I unsnapped the 
tag from my neck band and handed 
it to him. 

He looked at it, but didn't change 
expression. The Deacons are welltrained. He looked up again. "N/P, 
eh?" 

"Yes." 

"And you belong in Center 
Four." 
"Yes." 
"Explain." 

I did. Or tried to. Things were 
roiling around inside me, keeping 
me from thinking clearly. Once, as 
I talked, I thought I heard movement under the bank, but the Deacons didn't seem to notice anything. 
I tried to tell them of my troubles. 

There was no sympathy in their 
eyes. 

Apollo said, "See anybody pass 
by here?" 

"Pass by?" I hoped my look 
was innocent. "Who?" 

"Two fugitives. Nonconforms. 
Escaped during interview. Got the 
force screen turned off somehow — 
must have had spies helping them. 
You didn't see them, eh?" 

I shook my head. "I haven't seen 
anyone for several hours." 

APOLLO and his two friends 
traded glances. The one on 
the right was bull-necked and redheaded; the one on the left had a 



I. THE UNSPEAKABLE 



97 



neck and nose like a crane. It was 
the one on the left who suddenly 
smiled. Not a pleasant smile. He 
stepped up to Apollo and whispered something in his ear. Then 
Apollo smiled and turned to me 
again. 

"You're sure you haven't seen 
anyone." 

He knew something. I didn't 
know what, but it was too late to 
back, out now. I said, "Of course 
I'm sure." 

Apollo kept his eyes on me, hard, 
flat, stony, and held out his hand 
to the cranelike Deacon. "Your 
light," he said. The other handed 
it to him. Apollo flashed it on the 
ground. It came to rest upon unmistakable footprints in the soft 
moss. They led to the bank. 

I could be certain of arrest, and 
one of their little interviews now. 
I really had nothing to lose. Nothing that wasn't already lost — 

"Run!" I shouted at the top of 
my lungs. "They're coming!" 

There was a rustling under the 
bank. 

I leaped at Apollo. I leaped hard, 
with my feet solid, pushing me forward. My shoulder hit him in the 
midriff. He went down. I scrambled over him and jammed my 
thumb into his shoulder. He 
screamed. 

There was a buzzing sound and 
the smell of burned flesh, and a 
tenth of a second later I felt pain. 
One of the others had jammed his 
electric truncheon into the small of 



my back. It bored in, it burned, 
and I writhed and yelled. I couldn't help it. I rolled over. 

Someone was kicking at me. I 
grabbed his leg and pulled him 
down and when he struck the 
ground I twisted. Another shape 
bluned toward me — Apollo, recovered and on his feet again. Then 
buzzing, burned flesh, and the pain 
this time in the back of my neck. 
My head swirled. I thrashed, trying to get away. Get away where? 
That made not much difference. 
Away, that was all. 

The buzzing continued. It was 
through my flesh now and touching 
the spine. It would destroy the 
nerves in a moment. I would be 
dead — or even worse, a limp 
cripple, a rag doll. 

The smell of roasted flesh and 
hair was a thick, choking, sickening 
fog of decay. I couldn't breathe. 
There was blackness, swirling and 
concentric, closing in. 

I think one of them kicked me 
in the groin before I lost consciousness. 

I couldn't be sure. I couldn't be 
sure of anything. 

COMING out. Sound before 
sight and I heard the low 
voices. My eyes were already open. 
Nebulous shapes, now sharpening. 

I was in a small room with 
gleaming metal walls and I was on 
my back on a sort of table. Three 
men were in the room with me, 
standing over me. Apollo . . . the 



98 




 



bull-necked man . . . the man with 
the nose like a crane. 

Apollo was smiling. Pour water 
over that smile and immediately a 
film of ice would form. 

"A spy," said Apollo, looking 
into my open eyes. "Another damn 
spy." 

I shook my head. Ridiculous, 
but that's what I did. The movement pulled at the wound in the 
back of my neck and sharp pain, 
starting there, shot through my 
whole body. I grimaced and 
groaned. 

Apollo laughed, then suddenly 
brought his club hard across my 
face. My cheekbone seemed to 
make a crunching sound. 

"A spy, a damned spy," said 
Apollo. 

"We got a confession for you 
to sign," said the Crane. 

Apollo said, "Shut up. Not yet. 
We got to interview him first." 

"Look," I said, trying to lift 
my head, trying to rise upon my 
elbows, "call your chief. Call anybody like that. I can explain this 
whole thing. It's a long story — " 




E HIT me again across the 
other cheekbone. 



Shall I describe the next timeless 
endless hour? All the details? I 
don't remember all of them, of 
course, just the moments of sharpest pain that lifted me from the 
daze. Just the sound of my own 
screaming at times, and the helpless dryness of my own throat, and 



the sounds that kept coming from 
it even when the vocal cords were 
numb. 

Apollo and his pals had fun. 

There were the electric clubs. 
They become so hot at the tip that 
they will burn through an inch of 
pine in a couple of seconds. They 
go even quicker through flesh. 
After a while the smoke of my 
own burning flesh was thick in the 
room, and we all choked a little 
On it. 

They had more fun with fhcir 
fists, though. They didn't burn me 
in the worst places. They saved 
them for their fists and hands. 

After a while I couldn't scream. 
Only a hoarse, helpless, retching 
sound came out whenever I opened 
my mouth. 

Did I hear their voices then? I 
couldn't be sure whether I heard 
them speak, or whether I dreamed 
that they spoke. 

"He can't feel it any more now." 
That was Apollo's voice. 

"Wake him up again," said the 
Crane. "Give him a shot." 

"Oh, hell, I'm hungry," said 
Apollo. 

"All right," said the Crane, 
"let's go get something to eat. We 
can always come back again." 

Blackness, sweet blackness; and 
the sense of floating among the 
stars. Nothingness. It was exquisite now . . . even the touch of 
agony that still seeped through was 
exquisite. 

Hew much of this, I don't know. 



I, THE UNSPEAKABLE 



99 



I heard a voice again, and at 
first I thought my precious blackness was leaving me. I struggled 
to keep it. I grasped out, clutching 
with my mind. 

"Don't give up . . . we are coming . . ." 

It was her voice. The low, seductive voice of my dreams. But I 
didn't want to hear it now; this was 
the last thing I wanted to hear. 
This voice had brought me here, 
and I never wanted to hear it again. 

"No matter what the) say . . . 
no matter what they offer you or 
tell you . . . don't- give up." 

I fought it off. I drove it away 
by sheer mind-power. Either that or 
it stopped of itself. I didn't know 
and didn't care; all I wanted was 
peace and blackness again if I could 
find it. 

And then, after a while, I was 
awake, truly awake, and I knew 
this because I ached and burned 
all over. I could scarcely move. I 
lay on the tablelike thing and stared 
at the gleaming metal ceiling, not 
really seeing it. 

"How do you feel?" said somebody. 

I TURNED my head. The somebody was sitting beside me. He 
was a man of about fifty, thick-set 
and gray-haired with skin that 
looked like fine norcelain. His eyes 
were blue and^.ffiey seemed able, 
intelligent. He was not exactly 
smiling, but his expression was 
pleasant. Poised — that was the 



word. Here was a man who would 
quietly control things wherever he 
would go. 

I said, "Lousy. And you?" 

Ghost of a smile. "Sorry you had 
to go through it. We pick the Deacons because they're sadistically inclined. That makes for efficiency in 
the long run. Some people suffer, 
of course, but it's for the common 
good." 

I didn't say anything. If I had, 
it would have been insulting, unreasonable, blasphemous, obscene 
and treasonable. So I didn't say 
anylhing. I just kept staring at him. 

He continued to smile. "I'm 
N-J-K-F one seven seven three four 
nine, Chief of the Office of Psychological Adjustment. I'm usually 
simply Chief. I want you to consider me your friend — within the 
limits of State good, that is." 

I still didn't say anything. 

"Yours is quite a case, and of 
course I understand it. I think I 
had a quick insight into it the moment I spotted the arrest report on 
you. You're really lucky I happened 
to go through the arrest reports a 
little while ago, and got to you before the three Deacons who interviewed you returned. They were 
going to interview you some more." 
"Yes. I'm very lucky." My voice 
was flat, lifeless. 

' He leaned back easily in the 
chair. For all that he was thickset, he was graceful. He was handsome. His head, and deep, pleasant 
voice, and the cut of his porcelain 



100 




 



I, THE UNSPEAKABLE 



features all were handsome. Trust 
in me, said this handsomeness, I 
am a father to all men. 

"Naturally, we want to excuse 
your actions, and all the infractions 
you have committed in your rather 
desperate struggle for escape from 
your situation. Of course we'll have 
to re-evaluate your Emotional Adjustment Category. It must be very 
low by now. And I think I'll be 
able to assign a new name to you, 
and have it justify." 

Funny, here was the thing I'd 
sought and fought for, and now I 
had it, and this was the end of 
the long fight, and I didn't feel triumphant at all. I didn't even feel 
pleased. Funny. 

The chief said, "You can undoubtedly find a post suitable to a 
lower E.A.C. You can work your 
way up again. At least you'll be on 
productive status and have all the 
privileges that go with it." 

"Yes," I said. "Yes, I suppose 
so." 

"So there's really nothing to 
worry about now, is there?" 

"No, I suppose not." 

"There's just one little thing I'd 
like to go into before I take the 
steps necessary to get you on your 
feet again." Even his magnificent 
poise couldn't conceal the feather 
touch of slyness then. 

"One little thing?" I asked. 

THE pain was with me again. 
My body wasn't flesh; it was 
all raw, clinging pain. 



"We'll have to know who started 
you on your little quest. Who influenced you to try to have your 
name changed." 

I said, "I don't understand what 
you're talking about." 

He looked patient, smilingly patient. "It's rather obvious, you 
know. You wouldn't have acted as 
you did purely on your own impulses. I know that, because I cybed 
for your master file after I saw the 
report of arrest. Up until two days 
ago, your actions have always been 
satisfactorily conformal. A man 
doesn't change overnight like that 
without some sort of external influence." 

"But there wasn't any," I protested. "I mean, nobody told me to 
do anything. Nobody real." 

He chuckled. "Come now, you 
don't expect me to believe that, do 
you? After all, I deal with cases 
like this quite often. You're not 
the only one who has tried to upset 
the efficiency of the State. There's 
a pattern in these things, my friend. 
Almost invariably we find that a 
deliberate influence has gone to 
work on our infractor. There's a 
dangerous, organized underground 
movement that spends its time 
bringing these things about. One 
of its members unquestionably contacted you, suggested that you take 
the steps you have taken. Now, 
then, who was it?" 

"Nobody." I looked blank because I felt blank. 

The Chief sighed. "You've 



102 




 



changed more than I thought. Probably you're emotionally angry with 
the State now, after that little interview with the Deacons. That's understandable. But you'll have to 
come back to your senses. Let's put 
it this way, old man. // / don't get 
this information from you right 
now, the Deacons will." 

"Listen," I said, "what I'm telling you is the truth. There was nobody who told me to do anything. 
There was — well, there was a kind 
of voice that used to come into my 
dreams. A woman's voice. It suggested, in my dreams, that I go 
ahead and try to get my name 
changed. That's all." 

He wasn't smiling any more. "Do 
you really expect me to believe 
that?" 

"It's the truth, I tell you. It's the 
truth!" 

"Perhaps whoever influenced you 
did it subtly. Perhaps you never 
even realized it. Think back now. 
Who helped you? Who departed 
from standard and gave you any 
kind of aid?" 

Realization came like a cold wash. 
There had been help. Lara. She had 
gone out of her way back there in 
N. & I. She had been warm and 
real and she had dropped the mask 
of efficiency. Could it have been 
with a purpose? No matter. Guilty 
or innocent, if I mentioned her 
name, she would be interviewed. I 
didn't want that to happen to Lara. 
I shook my head and said, "No 
one helped me. I did it all my


self. You've got to believe that." 

"I don't," said the Chief, and got 
up. He looked at me for just a moment before he turned away. He 
said, "The boys will be able to have 
their fun, after all. I suppose it's 
just as well. It keeps their morale 
up to be able to interview somebody 
once in a while." 

"No! You can't! You can't send 
them in here again!" I shouted, 
without meaning to. I struggled to 
rise and found that I was strapped 
to the table. "No! No!" 

He was standing at the doorway 
to the room. He held a key-box 
oscillator in his hand- and I knew 
that a force screen held me in the 
cubicle here, and that without a keybox I could beat my head forever 
against that invisible barrier and 
never pass through that doorway. 
He said, "I'll give you one hour to 
decide. I'll be back. I'll ask you if 
you're ready to talk. If you aren't — 
well, you'll talk to the Deacons instead of me." 

The key-box hummed and he 
walked through the doorway and 
turned and disappeared. 

I stared after him and fought 
back my sudden nausea. 

V 

HOW long, then, lying there before a key-box hummed 
again? I didn't know. My time sense 
had been dulled. Even the pain was 
dull now; it was something that 
had always existed. 



I. THE UNSPEAKABLE 



103 



I looked at the shining ceiling. 

The glowlights began to dim and 
I supposed that since my arrest in 
the park another day had passed. 

Most of all, I wondered. Something had happened to me, something that I could almost feel as a 
physical change, but I didn't know 
quite what it was. I knew its results. I knew that I was no longer 
standard, no longer conformal, no 
longer well-behaved and moral and 
an efficient, useful citizen of the 
State. I hated the State. I hated all 
States. I hate all efficiency and common sense and hate. 

It suddenly came to me that I 
didn't care whether I was in 
Southern or Northern, or which of 
them ruled the world. 

I lay there. 

And presently a key-box hummed 
and I didn't even look that way. 
The stink of my own burning flesh 
still clung to my nostrils, the dull 
pain was still with me, but I didn't 
care. It was too much. When horror 
becomes too great, it stops being 
horror. The mind is smart. It 
doesn't believe; it doesn't register. 
The curve of sensation flattens out, 
stops, almost. 

When such horror looms, you go 
on doing whatever you are doing. 

I was lying there, so I went on 
lying there. 

"Don't speak," whispered a voice. 
"Don't ask questions." 

Something fumbled at the straps. 
I turned my head, and two people 
were in the room. They were thin. 



and their eyes were overlarge and 
they were naked and covered with 
bruises. The fugitives of the park 
last night! 

"What are you doing here?" 

Finger to the lips. That was the 
man. He was taking the straps from 
my legs. The woman was releasing 
my arms and shoulders. 

"But—" 

"Sh !" That was the woman. 

In a moment they had me free. I 
started, confidently, to rise, and the 
pain streaked through me like a 
powder rocket. They helped me. I 
stood there, amazed that I could 
stand. They helped me go forward. 
I took several dizzy steps, and after 
that it wasn't as bad. We moved 
through the doorway; there was no 
force screen. The man held the keybox. He pressed it as we moved 
away, to bring the force screen into 
place once more. 

I said, "Where are we — ?" 

I was shushed again. We went on 
through the corridors. Dead oyster 
white corridors. I walked as through 
a sea of marshmallow. Time sense 
was gone again and we were pushing on and on and there was no end 
in sight and we had already forgotten the beginning. 

We took an automatic shaft to 
another level and walked more corridors. 

ONCE we passed an opening and 
tunnelcars filled with people 
roared past. I had a flash glimpse of 
them. They sat there staring straight 



104 




 



ahead, wearing the efficient expressions of good workers. State corpses. 

Suddenly we emerged into the 
dark. It was the dark of night, but 
after the tunnels it was practically 
sunrise. The air was clean — no, it 
was not actually as clean as the conditioned air below. It was more than 
clean. It was dive. 

We were on the edge of a great 
concrete paved area. About a hundred yards ahead, a massive, shining, fat needle rose into the air, and 
squatted there against the stars. It 
was a spaceship in its launching 
cradle. There were low buildings 
near it, a few floodlights, and people standing around. It took a moment to realize that the men walking 
up and down and along the groups 
of people, the men with rifles on 
their shoulders, were guards. 

"Luck, now, that's all we need. A 
little luck," said the thin man beside 
me. It was the first time I had heard 
his voice. It was a low voice; he 
spoke with emotion. It was not approved standard. 

The woman moved beside him 
and put her hand upon his arm. 

I said, "May I talk now?" 

He turned to me, smiling. The 
smile had something of that sadness 
I had first noticed when he sat a 
prisoner in the jetcopter. "You want 
an explanation, don't you? Of 
course you do. But I'm afraid I can't 
tell you very much, except that we 
were sent to get you." 

"Sent? By whom? How did you 
have a key-box? And — " 



He laughed. "Wait, one question 
at a time. I was a force screen technician before — before we were arrested. Cells are the same everywhere. I know how to short the 
screens out from the inside; it's 
troublesome, but it can be done. 
That's how we escaped the first 
time. Then they discovered we were 
gone, chased us, and you gave us 
our second chance. We came here to 
the rendezvous. There were six here, 
including our elected leader. When 
we told the leader what had happened, she arranged for us to return, find you, and help you escape. 
It wasn't any problem to lift a keybox from the rack where they're 
usually kept.". 

I FELT as though I had been put 
upon the end of a huge oscillating spring. I said, "The leader? 
She?" 

"You'll meet her," he said. 
"After blastoff you'll meet her. 
Right now our problem is to slip in 
among those prisoners without being 
seen." 

"Among the prisoners}" 
"Haven't time to explain more. 
You'll have to trust us. Unless you 
want to stay here and have the 
Deacons hunt you till they find 
you." 

He was right: wherever I was 
going, I had to go. I couldn't go 
back now. Ever. I said, "I trust 
you. Let's go." 

Slipping in wasn't really difficult. 
There were only one or two guards 



I, THE UNSPEAKABLE 



10S 




for each group of prisoners, and 
they were looking for someone to 
escape, not join their flock. Some 
of the prisoners were dressed, some 
naked. Some looked bruised and 
beaten; some did not. It all depended on whether they had been 
questioned. They all looked dulleyed, resigned. They paid remarkably little attention as' we moved in 
among them, and stood there. 

THE guards began to call out orders presently and the groups 
shuffled forward, and then single 
lines moved up the ramp and into 
the spaceship. The thin man and his 
woman were still with me. "They 
don't bother to count," he whispered, "so we woij't be noticed." 

I wanted to' ask -him other questions, but we were divided into 
groups and they weren't in mine. 
Minutes later I found myself in 



the vast hull, sitting on one of the 
tiers that hold the seats vertical 
when the ship is tail-based for blastoff. It was very dim here and I 
couldn't readily make out the faces 
of the people on the same tier with 
me. 

A loudspeaker came to life; a 
deep, impersonal voice. "Fasten 
your webbings carefully!" 

I did that and heard the rustling 
sounds about me as the others did 
it, too. 

"Stand by for blastoff!" 

There was a dead pause, then a 
sudden low throbbing roar and the 
feeling of life in the floor plates 
and the bulkheads. I felt the slightest weight of pressure against the 
seat. The seat began to tilt slightly. 

Suddenly a soft voice on my left 
spoke: "We're on our way. They 
can't stop us now, can they?" 

It was the same low, provocative 


 



106 




THE UNSPEAKABLE 



woman's voice that I had heard in 
my dreams! 

I whirled my head. I could see 
only the shape of flowing hair, no 
features. "Who are you?" 

She laughed. "No wonder you 
don't recognize me. The natural 
voice is different than approved 
standard, isn't it? Listen. Do you 
remember this?" The 'head cocked 
to one side and a crisp, formal voice 
came out. "Information you desire 
is in Bank 29." 

"Lara!" I said. I pushed toward 
her, but the webbing held me back. 

"Yes. It's I. And we're together 
now and we'll have a long, long 
time to find out about each other. 
It's ten weeks to Mars." 

IRAN my hand over my forehead. "I don't get it. I don't get 
any of it. Your voice — I mean your 
real voice, not the standard one — I 
dreamed about it, and — " 

"I know." I could see her nod. 
"It wasn't a dream, though. I was 
talking to you. Each time. That was 
the way we planned it from the 
beginning." 

"Talking to me? But — but how? 
Through the sleep-learner?" 

"No, we'd never have been able 
to arrange that. It was through your 
identity tag, which would almost 
always be in contact with your skin 
when you slept. It has a microscopic 
electrical circuit, both between its 
metal halves and painted on its surface. The same principle as the 
sleep-learner, tactile induction, and, 



of course, a highly selective onechannel receiver. All I needed to do 
was put my transmitter on that same 
frequency." 

I shook my head. "I follow, I 
guess, but I'm still baffled. Why all 
this? When did—" 

"Wait for me to finish," she said. 
"We've been organized and underground, just as the Deacons suspect, 
for some time. One of our members 
worked on the identity tags and, 
when renumbering came about, it 
was a perfect opportunity to plant 
the receivers. We picked our people 
carefully. We picked doctors and 
hydroponic experts and chemists 
and rocket pilots — and we picked 
you because of your knowledge of 
space drive theory. Someday we'll 
go on to the stars; someday you'll 
help us do that. Anyway, all these 
people we have picked — or most of 
them — are joining us on Mars. 
There's where mankind will begin 
again while Northern and Southern 
sit upon earth and glare at each 
other across the equator and wait 
for war." 

"But Mars — there's an equator 
there, too." 

She laughed. "Northern and 
Southern prisoners there mingle all 
the time. There aren't enough 
guards to notice it, or stop it if they 
did notice it. There have even been 
hundreds of intermarriages." 

"Marriages? You mean like the 
pre-atomics ?" 

"Exactly. But we'll get to that 
later. We needed you for our 



108 




 



colony, only it wasn't likely that 
you'd infract all by yourself. You 
were too standard, too adjusted. We 
had to give you something to shake 
you out of it, to make you realize 
that the security of the State was 
not security, but slavery. And so 
one of our members in the renumbering bureau arranged for you to 
have that four letter word of yours 
for a name. One thing led to another, then, not always exactly as 
we'd planned it, but always in the 
same general direction. Our whole 
plan nearly failed when the 
Deacons nabbed you in the park. 
Fortunately, I'd come along to 
stow away on this trip, and I sent 
those others back after you." 

"But what if I'd actually managed to get my name changed?" 

THE ship was swaying now, 
balanced on its rocket trail. 
The acceleration was increasing. The 
seat was swinging back. The roar 
was becoming louder. 

"It was unlikely enough to take a 
chance on it. We felt at the veryleast you'd be kept on N/P status 
and then we could work on you 
some more until you infracted, and 
got sent to Marscol as a nonconform. Funny, that seems a terrible 
fate to most people. Actually, it's 
the only escape. From what I hear 
of Mars we'll like it there." 
I was recovering a little now and 



I dared to say, "If you're there, too, 
I'll like it. I know that." 

"Oh, you'll like other things. 
You'll like everything. And on 
Mars they'll call you by your present 
name if you wish, and no one will 
be at all shocked by it." There was 
a slight pause and then she said, 
"In fact, it's a very nice name. I — 
I wouldn't mind having it myself." 

"Is that what the pre-atomics 
called a proposal?" 

She laughed. "I'm not sure. But 
at least we have ten weeks to talk it 
over — " 

And then the acceleration pressed 
hard and the gray curtain began to 
come, and I knew that when it was 
lifted we would be on our way 
through space. I thought in that 
moment of the name that had 
brought all this about — the unspeakable four letter word that no conformist would ever dare voice, or 
even think of; the word, the dangerous word inimical to all that the 
warring, efficient State meant and 
stood for. 

The word, I realized, that eventually would destroy all that. 

I dared to say it now. I spelled 
it out first, and then I pronounced 
it. Just loud enough for Lara to 
hear above the growing roar. 
"L-O-V-E," I said. "Love." 

I heard Lara repeat it before the 
momentary blackout came.

This could be an Easter 
easier to tell if legend 
like truth— or we moderns 



story. It would be much 
didn't sound so exactly 
knew one from the other! 



HAT'S it today?" 
asked the neurotic 
Mrs. Francis Pake. 
"Overtime or that night out?" 

"I can't tell you for certain, 
sweet. I'll phone you. I'm nearly 
sure, but — " 

"This is it," said Betty Pake. She 
got up from the breakfast table. 
"Change your job or change your 
wife. Quite simple, Frank. I 
thought I'd married a man, not an 
accounting machine." 

She said a lot more before Pake 
finished his breakfast. He sighed, 
missed when he pecked for her 
cheek, and left. 

The Mitchell embezzlement 
which had kept him in the office 
all hours for the past three months 
had been finally straightened out 



yesterday, and full material for the 
indictment handed over. Tonight, 
dine, dance and drink with Betty 
— unless something new turned 
up. She rated the break, of course, 
apart from the fact that her nerves, 
unsettled by a quiet life, played 
hell with his digestion. Maybe she 
should have married a younger 
man, with time and money to spare 
for her idea of living. 

He realized uncomfortably that 
he was half hoping something 
would prevent the date. 

The assignment this morning, for 
instance. It was out of the ordinary. 
No books to examine or reluctant 
employees to quiz politely but inexorably. He got straight onto it 
before going to the office. 

Early as it was, the waiting room 



Illustrated by JAMES VINCENT 



110

111 



in which he found himself was 
full. Forty patients at least. An obvious Parkinsonism stumbled to a 
bench. Every disease seemed to be 
represented there, from cancer to 
cretinism. 

He recalled the chief's instructions: make no fuss, get in line with 
the others, take what he hands out 
and — bring it back. 

"You have an appointment?" 
asked the dull-eyed, dull-voiced 
receptionist. 

"No, but if this is an open session, I'll hang around on the offchance. My time's my own." 

"Name?" 

"Shando. James." 

Did those dull eyes light up ? No 
reason to. So far as he knew, the 
quack had no reason to suspect a 
Federal investigation. 

"Sit down, please." 

What was it, Pake asked himself as she went into an inside office 
— faith healing? That wouldn't fix 
peritonitis. But that was only a report. He'd have to wait and ask 
careful questions. Careful, because 
patients don't usually question 
doctors on their training and background. 

He looked casually at the man 
next to him. A young Eurasian, 
drawn-in, huddled, gloved hands 
clasped together, as if in silent, 
fierce prayer. 

"What ails, feller?" 

The Eurasian seemed to shrink 
even further into himself, shook 
his head almost imperceptibly. 



Please don't notice me. It was as 
plain as words. 

Then Pake saw the patch of silvery skin beneath the ear. He muttered, "Hell," and jerked away. 

"Sorry, sorry." The faintest of 
whispers. "Not contagious." 

"Maybe not, but you shouldn't 
be here. You should be- — " Pake 
stopped, uneasy. There was a world 
of misery in the man's eyes. 

If the fake beyond that door was 
giving fake hope to poor devils 
like this . . . But that didn't make 
it a government matter. It was up 
to the state, or the local branch of 
the F.M.A. He didn't call himself a doctor, of course, nor did 
he advertise. But did that put him 
in the clear? 

Pake cursed the brevity of his 
instructions. "If you question him," 
the chief had said, "make it 
simple. You can be normally curious, but that's all. And if he gets 
cagy, cut it out. You're not going 
as an agent. You're just an errand 
boy, Frankie, and you know as 
much as I do." 

The receptionist came back, 
walked over to him. 

"It seems you did have an appointment," she lied calmly. "This 
way." 

A DOOR closed behind him. 
Pake, off-guard, found himself talking before he had taken in 
the scene. "This is good of you, 
doctor, but I had no appointment. 
I don't like jumping the line." 



112 




 



"I am entitled to use my discretion. You are an interesting case. 
Sit down. And please don't call me 
doctor. In the healing profession, 
that title is reserved for those who 
have taken the Hippocratic oath. 
My name is Trancore." 

Pake shut his mind to a thousand questions and concentrated on 
one. "How do you know about my 
case? You've never seen me before." 

"My receptionist," said the man 
behind the desk, "has intuitive 
diagnostic ability." 

THAT settled it, Pake thought. A 
first-water quack. Heck, he'd 
never had a day's real sickness in 
his forty years. Mild post-nasal 
drip, maybe, but that was probably 
a penalty for oversmoking. He felt 
the tickle of it at the back of his 
throat now. He blew his nose. It 
gave him a few seconds to think 
and observe. 

The "healer" was quite unremarkable except for an almost unnoticeable Asiatic tinge of skin. 
His features might have been the 
compounded norm of a thousand 
faces flittingly seen during a subway rush-hour. He'd be lost in a 
crowd. No, put him in a crowd 
and he would be the crowd — The 
fantastic thought touched Pake's 
consciousness and slid away before 
he could examine it. 

The office, rented furnished, was 
quite unimpressive. Old-fashioned 
wooden desk, cheap chairs, battered 



filing cabinet, empty, Pake was 
willing to bet. 

"Symptoms?" Trancore asked. 

"Seems you can tell me," Pake 
said with a trace of belligerence. 

"Let's say the recital is part of 
the treatment. I don't wish to 
guess." 

It should be an "interesting 
case." Pake had spent an hour boning up on it at a medical library. 
An obscure disease, a complexus of 
symptoms calculated to faze the 
most expert diagnostician for a 
while. It would certainly defeat the 
snap diagnoses and miraculously 
swift cures attributed to this phony. 
And no doctor could confirm it 
without the most exhaustive physical examination, which this fellow 
didn't go in for, apparently. 

As Pake was talking, Trancore 
looked into a drawer of his desk. 
His face was without expression. 

He looked up only when Pake 
finished, and smiled. "Prognosis, 
death within eleven months, eh? 
But you won't die. Take this in 
water." He put a plastic capsule 
within Pake's reach. 

"But this is crazy! How do I 
know — " 

"You don't. I make no claims. 
What did you expect, a long, obscure rigmarole? You can take the 
capsule or leave it. How many 
tokens — pounds — do you have with 
you?" 

"But listen, doctor—" 

"I'm not a doctor. How much?" 

"Around fifty, I suppose." 



FIELD STUDY 



113 



"Give me twenty- five for the 
capsule, which you take on faith. 
If you take it." 

"You say I'll die if I don't?" 

"I said nothing of the kind. I 
have no intention of running foul 
of your laws. Please make up your 
mind." 

Pake took it. 

" A S MUCH personality as a 

-X~\. boiled duck," Pake reported to his chief. "But somehow I 
couldn't get around to asking 
questions." 

The chief tossed the capsule in 
his palm. "That doesn't matter. 
This is all we wanted." 

The laboratories took five hours 
to break it down, make tests and 
come up with the final, headscratching nonsense line: just a 
mess of soluble protein with no 
discernible physiological reactions. 

"That was yours," the chief said. 
"These were brought in by the 
others, a plainclothes man from 
Police H.Q., an employee of the 
National Medical Association, an 
official of the N.M.A., and a private 
investigator." 

Pake leafed through the reports. 
"The same?" 

"Yes. But here are three reports 
on capsules given to genuine 
patients and 'borrowed' for analysis 
afterward. The patients didn't miss 
a thing, even though the operative 
substituted similar capsules containing water and a vegetable dye. It 
took five minutes for the laboratory 



to discover that that's all the 
'borrowed' capsules contained, 
also." 

Pake began to laugh. Then he 
remembered the leper. "Can't 
Trancore be booked for fraud?" 

"How? He makes no claims for 
the damned things. And in several 
instances, he's given them away. 
But don't you see the implication 
of these reports?" 

Pake nodded. "Patients get 
water. Investigators get something 
just- as useless — except for giving 
laboratory men a headache. So he 
knows who is what. I don't get it." 

"You will. I'm turning the case 
over to you, Frankie." 

"I'm interested. But how come 
it's on our level?" 

"It's international. Come and 
meet the United Nations." The 
chief frowned as he rose. "I've 
been trying to put my finger on 
something since you came in. Now 
I've got it. Your voice." 

"What's wrong with it?" 

"Not a thing. Sounds clearer, 
somehow." 

Pake stood very still. He swore, 
slowly, then cleared his throat. 
There was nothing to clear. "My 
post-nasal drip!" He blew his nose 
frantically, pointlessly. "It's gone!" 

SIR Greville Gray of London, 
Luchaire of Paris, Frend of 
Berlin, Stawowy of Prague — Pake 
.heard substantially the same story 
from each. 

In Harley Street, London's spe

cialist district, Trancore had rented 
a £50 a week consulting room, 
given free treatment to two cardiac 
cases, then pulled out when the 
waiting list grew unmanageable — 
or when he'd fulfilled his unknown 
purpose. 

Gray, chairman of the English 
Medical Association, had interviewed him officially. 

"Impudent little devil called 
me 'the chief witch-doctor.' I nearly assaulted him." Gray squared 
his massive shoulders. "When I 
said we'd prosecute, .he flatly denied that he practiced medicine at 
all. 'To arraign me,' he said, 'you 
would have to prove that I give 
treatment, that I charge for it, make 
claims for it, and that it may prove 
harmful. You cannot even prove 
the first accusation.' I pointed out 
that he dispensed capsules and 
charged for them. He said, 'They 
expect something material, like the 
evil-smelling charms you give them. 
I offer them a capsule. They take 
it or leave it. It makes no difference. They pay or don't pay. That 
makes no difference, either. I prefer them to pay. It makes my stay 
shorter.' 

"I asked whether he expected 
me to believe that his patients were 
cured no matter what course they 
took. 'They are not my patients,' he 
said. 'If, after they have visited me, 
a cure is effected and they claim 
my instrumentality, then that is not 
my responsibility.' 

"In a word, he disclaims every


thing, even success. Two days later, 
when a newspaper followed up a tip 
about so-called 'miracle cures,' a 
reporter found a queue stretching 
out into the street — and an empty 
office. Ten weeks later, the fellow 
turns up in Paris, and the business 
starts over again." 

"But not," said Dr. Luchaire 
gently, "the same man." 

Sir Greville shifted uneasily in 
his chair. "A good disguise." 

"Photographs?" asked Pake. 

His chief, smiling a little, handed him two buttonhole camera 
enlargements. There was an elusive 
similarity, a strained family likeness; but neither was patently of 
the man Pake had seen that morning. 

Pake said, "The norm of a 
crowd. If it's the same man, he's 
a human chameleon." 

ATTEMPTS to get fingerprints 
had been curiously unsuccessful. Either he had had them obliterated through surgery or he put on 
gloves before touching anything. 
Maybe he made sure to touch nothing. The last idea was fantastic, but 
what wasn't about this case? 

Pake asked, "Why has no effort 
been made before to collate available material, if this has been going on for so long?" 

Dr. Frend of Berlin grunted. 
"The medical profession is not an 
international police force. There is 
fraternal exchange of information 
in periodicals, naturally, but no 



FIELD STUDY 



115 



medical man would risk his reputation by lending credence to such a 
fantastic rumor as, for instance, the 
cure of an advanced leukemia." 

"But that man was my own 
patient!" Dr. Stawowy of Prague 
was indignant. 

"I'm not challenging your veracity or ability. Genuinely mistaken 
diagnoses are not unknown," Frend 
said coldly. "I was merely explaining to this gentleman why there 
has been such delay in instigating 
an international investigation. The 
matter was brought into the open 
only recently at a European congress, of which I happened to be 
chairman. The feeling of the meeting was that these rumors should 
be traced to their source, as a professional and public duty. I agreed 
to act as coordinator of a small 
sub-committee appointed for this 
purpose. That is why we are here. 
Personally, I am not convinced that 
this man is anything more than a 
faker and an opportunist." 

Michaels of the N.M.A. shook 
his head. "A man from an adjacent 
office was carried in to him a couple 
of days ago with every symptom 
of a burst appendix. This 'faker' 
protested at first, .said he wasn't a 
doctor. Then he asked to be left 
alone with him. Ten minutes later, 
that man walked out unaided." 

"Nicely stage-managed," said 
Frend. "He was a stooge." 

"We checked. It's difficult to believe there was collusion. The patient is a solid, decent citizen. He 



said the pain began to go when 
Trancore had been looking at him 
for a while. In his own words, he 
felt something moving in his guts, 
and then the pain stopped." 

"I find it less difficult to believe 
that he was a stooge," repeated 
Frend obstinately. 

Pake's chief intervened. "Gentlemen, my department has received 
instructions to give you every assistance in obtaining information 
about this man. Mr. Pake will be 
in charge. We are not concerned 
with the medical side of the case, 
but only with its legal aspects." 

HE paused, dropped diplomatic 
language. "Though why in 
hell it should be my department 
instead of the police, or the D.A.'s 
office, or the Bureau of Public Welfare, or the Bureau of Immigration 
is something I still haven't figured." 

Sir Greville Gray said, "In every 
instance where a direct law-enforcement agency was about to "investigate, even before his identity papers 
could be asked for, the man has 
disappeared. His nationality is unknown. He operates only for as 
long as he can escape widespread 
notice and police attention. That's 
why the few newspaper stories that 
have appeared are quite disconnected and based solely on speculation. 
Your approach must be very discreet." 

"Seems it'll have to be invisible, 
too," Pake said. "He knows I'm 



116 




 



an operative already. But he cured 
my — " 

Pake stopped. Maybe his postnasal drip had cleared up of its 
own accord. It was a comforting 
thought. He wished he could believe it. 

IN HIS office— "I'm sorry, 
sweetkin," he told the phone. 
"Just can't make it tonight. I've 
got to stay on this case. It's — er — 
detective work. The police are helping me." 

The nerve-edged vehemence of 
his wife's voice grated on his ear. 
He held the receiver an inch away. 

"So you think you're a real Gman now, a big tough hero running around with a bottle of rye 
and a blonde. Well, listen, hero, I 
hope they shoot first. I'm through." 

"It's nothing like that, hon. 
You're getting mixed up, anyway. 
Bureau men don't drink on duty. 
And you're pretty hard to please — 
you called me an accounting machine this morning. But look, lovesome, I'll be home around seven. 
It's just that I have to stay near a 
phone. We could play checkers. 
And I promise I'll grab me a day 
off—" 

He held the receiver six inches 
from his ear. "I'm sorry," he said 
again loudly and lowered the 
phone, which was still angrily vibrating, to the cutoff. 

There was a note on the kitchen 
table when he got home. 

"An old school friend called. 



Anyway, that's my story, hero. And 
we're going places. Don't wait up." 

Pake sighed. Hero ... He curled 
his lean body up in a chair by the 
phone with a book. 

The call came at midnight: 
"He's skipped." 

"I was waiting for that. I've seen 
the papers. Keep on it." 

Pake turned back to the midnight editions. There were few 
facts. Three patients had been interviewed. From the descriptions, 
one was the Eurasian with leprosy 
he had seen that morning. 

The word-of -mouth snowball 
and the inevitable newspaper swoop 
had taken just two weeks this time. 
In Paris, Trancore had lasted a 
month. 

One newspaper admitted that 
they had an anonymous call claiming a miracle cure, days previously, 
but had put it down to a cultist bid 
for publicity. 

The phone rang again. The caller 
said, "If this guy doesn't come out 
of his office soon, these newspapermen will bust the door down. What 
shall I do?" 

"You're on loan from the police, aren't you? If they try that, 
identify yourself and threaten to 
book 'em. You don't need to mention that Trancore isn't in that office 
anyway." 

The phone spluttered disbelief. 

Pake grimaced. "I know how 
you feel, sergeant. Maybe he flew 
out of the window. He was picked 
up as he came out of the front 



FIELD STUDY 



117 



entrance, and I'm waiting to hear 
where he holes up. But spin those 
reporters some yarn and keep them 
there if you can." 

Pake shook his head as he put 
the phone down. 

He took a freshening shower. 
Past twelve was a fine time for 
newspapermen, police and miracle 
healers to be about their business — 
did Trancore ever sleep, or had he 
gone in for all-night sessions? — 
but Accountancy Branch men 
worked office hours. 

Discreet investigation guaranteed, every cent traced through the 
best-cooked books. That was probably Washington's line of thought: 
if Accountancy could do it with 
embezzled cents, they could do it 
with elusive fake doctors. 

But these cents didn't add up. 
It didn't make sense. 

Nonsense. A whole row of thaumaturgical non-cents. 

Accountancy could trace a cent. 

So, logically, they could scent a 
trace. And sense a non-scent . . . 

Uh-uh. Pull yourself together, 
hero . . . 

Pake lolled his tongue at the 
mirror. Clean and pink, no fuzz or 
sign of civilized costiveness. 

Constipation. Post-nasal drip. 
And leprosy. 

He leaned forward until his 
forehead touched the mirror. His 
eyes showed red tracery beneath 
drooping lids. What did real Government men — not the office-bound 
type — do to stay awake? 



Pake recalled Betty's crack about 
rye and a blonde. And he remembered a nearly full bottle. 

He answered the insistent phone 
with a glass in one hand. 

He jotted the address of a cheap 
rooming house, dressed and left, 
thoughtfully putting the bottle in a 
pocket. 

THE man on watch said, "Room 
five. Going in?" 
Pake shrugged. "I don't know. 
If I do, he'll probably float out of 
a back window; This kind of thing 
isn't up my alley." 

The watcher looked surprised. 
"Why, you're F.B.I., aren't you?" 

"Not so's you'd notice," said 
Pake gloomily. He shivered a little 
in the after-midnight chill. 

Someone was emerging from the 
building. The watcher drew Pake 
into the shadow of an unlighted 
shop doorway. "It's him, anyway." 
Then he frowned. "No. Sorry. Same 
build, but — " 

"For my money," Pake murmured, peering across the road, 
"you were right first time. The 
norm of a crowd." 
"Hey, whadya doing?" 
Pake shook off the restraining 
hand. "I don't know," he said 
again. "Ask him for a light, maybe. This can't be played according 
to the Detectives' Manual. If there 
is such a thing. I wouldn't know. 
If he vanishes in a puff of smoke, 
call the psychiatric ward ambulance 
— for me."

Pake's lanky strides quickly overtook the slow-moving man. 
"Pardon me — " 

The man turned. "Good morning, Mr. Pake. I congratulate you 
on your acuity of perception and 
your imagination. How are your 
nasal passages?" 

The world reeled a little on its 
axis. 

"Walk with me," said Trancore, 
and took Pake's arm. "But first 
signal to your policeman that he 
needn't follow us." 

Frankie Pake flapped a limp, 
dismissing hand at the watcher in 
the shadows, and walked on into a 
dream. 

"Am I mad?" he asked simply, 
after a while. 

"No. You're saner than most. 
Your higher cortical centers are 
momentarily dulled by fatigue and 
alcohol, giving full reign to intuition. 'Hunch' you term it. An endearing quality when allied with 
imagination. A saving grace, indeed, of your race." 

"You're from India?" 

"Trancore is a good Indian 
name. Incidentally, fatigue is a disease." 

Pake said, "Don't cure me; I 
couldn't bear to wake up. When 
do we start running like hell to 
stay in the same place? Pardon 
me." 

Trancore shook his head as 
Pake, still walking, upended a 
bottle to his lips. The sidewalk was 
crowding up and the lights bright


ening in nagging neon as they 
neared Broadway. 

Pake lowered the bottle. "You 
still here?" 

"You expect me to disappear? 
I could, quite easily, by convincing 
you of my non-presence, as I did 
when I walked past those men outside my office. Or I could slip into 
a crowd and, within limitations, 
alter the apparent cast of my features to conform seemingly with 
an average. But don't you want to 
ask me some questions?" 

Pake pondered this. "Maybe I 
do. Why do you want to answer 
them?" He was feeling less like 
a real G-man and more like an 
Accountancy Branch investigator 
every moment. "You figure I'm 
harmless, huh?" he added resentfully. "Like my wife?" 

"By no means. If I weren't about 
to conclude my own particular investigation, I would say that you 
were most dangerous to me. Your 
imagination is quite highly developed." 

Pake stopped. He grabbed Trancore's sleeve. "I can't walk and 
think," he announced. He dumped 
the empty bottle by a fire-plug. 

THEY sat on high stools in the 
garish light of an open-fronted 
soft-drinks bar. 

"If this is going to be a jag," 
Pake said, "I suggest we lay a 
foundation of milk." 

Smells wafted in from the street, 
the delicate and the insistent inter

mingled: rubber, hot oil, burned 
gasoline, cheap perfume, sweat, 
dust, peppermint: astringent tang 
of warm steel, of leather, even of 
stone. It had been a hot day before 
the sun went down. 

Pake sniffed appreciatively. 

"It's a sense we abuse and neglect," he said as the milk was 
served. "You did cure my postnasal drip, didn't you?" 

Trancore had been watching him 
with a half-smile. "All those questions in your mind, yet you relish 
this rediscovery above all. I don't 
despair of you." Trancore sipped 
his milk. "The infection was cured 
by your body. I helped. I can't tell 
you how, unless you have five hundred years to spare." 

"Hardly," Pake said. "I haven't 
twelve hours to spare, if I'm to 
save my job. Or my reputation. 
Which, or either, I'm not sure." 
He caught Trancore's amused eye. 
"All right, that's not true. But I 
need answers to a pretty lengthy 
questionnaire. Who, when, what, 
why, where — you know." 

"You're convinced I'm a telepath?" 

"Aren't you?" 

"Not in your sense of the term, 
which is a semantic misnomer in 
any case. As a diagnostician, I sense 
abnormalities in physiological functioning. As a psychologist, I sense 
— difference. In purpose and function. When you came into my 
waiting room, I knew you were 
not there as a patient. Your pres



I 

ence was a disharmony. The same 
with your colleagues. As for your 
name and your occupation, they 
are naturally blazed so clearly on 
the surface of your mind that even 
your native clairvoyants could read 
the information." 

"That," Pake breathed, "takes a 
load off my mind. You don't, for 
instance, know what I'm thinking 
about that dark-haired ex-blonde 
who just served us those shakes?" 

"The one with the excellent pectoral development? No. Your own 
muzzy picturafe and thalamic concepts are your own. I can't interpret 
them." 

Pake said, "Fine. You know all 
about the aphrodisiac effects of 
alcohol, though. Are you too big 
for me to understand, or can I see 
you clear and self-explanatory 
against the background of Broadway?" 

Trancore did not reply for a 
moment. He was looking at the 



120 




 



other occupants of the bar. There 
was something like pity in his eyes. 
Not pity, though, Pake decided, 
searching hard for another word. 



Something bigger; less human, perhaps. Or more human. Compassion ? 

Trancore said, as if to himself, 



FIELD STUDY 



121 



"The girl with the bright face 
laughing at the febrile witticisms of 
her unpleasant escort: three-quarters 
of her right lung has gone." 

Pake felt he was overhearing 
something he shouldn't. But he 
said, "You could put her right?" 

"I could stop the rot in that 
lung, Pake. But she would return 
to that back room full of smoke 
and dust. She would still travel 
on a crowded subway to an overheated office. She'd still starve herself to buy clothes to keep in 
fashion. I don't have a cure for 
those things." 

"That's the first time you've admitted you have a cure for anything." 

Frankie Pake felt confused, despite his acceptance of the situation — which still surprised him. 
And he felt grudgingly humble. 
He saw, as if for the first time, the 
face of the man who called himself 
Trancore. 

It had been the norm of the 
crowd, a pale blur in a flashlight 
shot of a moving mob. Now it was 
individual, seen clear and not 
through a wavering mask. The underlying personality was revealed, 
strong, but with no desire for domination. 

There were those once-precious 
pulps that Betty had scornfully banished to an out-of-the-way cupboard 
when they'd moved into the apartment. Clues there, maybe? Mutant 
superman in hiding? Spy from a 
far galaxy? — ouch! No ray- guns, 



no squirming, tentacled horrors, 
no — 

A little sanity, a little sobriety, 
little hero . . . 

"What are you, Mr. Trancore?" 

"A healer. That is my profession." 

"And now suppose you answer 
the question." 

"Is your head clear?" 

PAKE, remembering the rye, 
said, "Strangely, it is. But I'm 
a little drunk from the neck down, 
and the dream-state persists." 

"I wish," said Trancore? — and it 
seemed the most foolish, yet the 
most significant thing that Pake 
could remember hearing him say — 
"I wish sometimes that I could 
escape reality so easily, by imparting to it the patina of a dream. 
You all do that." He got up. "I'm 
going to work now. I have about 
eight hours. You will be my guide." 
"What do you want to see?" 
"This city at play in the predawn hours." 

Pake gave a humorful grunt. 
"My wife would suit you better in 
the role of guide. She's playing 
pretty hard right now." 

He explained. He wanted to explain. Betty was suddenly vivid in 
his mind: beautiful but fretful, at 
odds with life, yearning for the 
opiate of soft lights and sweet music, afraid to face herself, afraid 
to proclaim her interest in humanity in case such a generalized belief should hurt her in some way. 



122 




 



Trancore listened sympathetically 
as Pake spoke of the broken date 
and his own preference for the 
quiet life. 

Trancore said, "Surely she'll appreciate the irony of this when you 
tell her?" 

"The hell she will ! If she knows 
I've been painting the town without her, even in line of duty — " 

Trancore asked, "Do you know 
where she's likely to be?" 

Pake looked at him curiously. 
"There's a couple of spots she 
fancies." 

"Could we go there a little 
later?" He held up his hand as 
Pake was about to veto the idea. 
"I promise you there'll be no unpleasant consequences if we meet 
her." 

Pake believed him. Pake would 
have believed in a panhandling 
green hippo with puce spots at that 
moment. The apparition would have 
been absorbed without comment 
into the basic fantasy of this situation. 

THEY started at Brondine's, 
where it was boasted that any 
potable man had ever devised for 
the delectation of palate and the 
drugging of senses could be served 
— with second choice on the house 
if first choice wasn't in stock. 

Trancore asked for the first 
twelve favorites, took them in turn 
without a blink. 

Pake stuck to rye, watched, and 
listened. 



"Your palates," observed Trancore, "are more civilized than your 
minds." 

"But why," asked Pake in wonderment, "are you still upright?" 

"I make sure to eliminate the 
poisons in the alcohol, and thus the 
toxic effects. As a rule, I don't 
drug. But when in Rome — " 

Something lit up in Pake's mind. 
Fantasy came to fantasy. He remembered a story. "Now I get it. 
You're from the future!" 

Trancore laughed, genuinely. 
"Your imagination deserves something better than comic strips to 
work on. It's fascinating, but depressing, to see science negated by 
superstition, and your concept . of 
time is the greatest superstition. 
Let's go. A game shop next." 

He meant a pinball arcade. 

He cheated abominably. Pake 
watched a steel ball bump the thousand pin twenty times, defying gravity. "Surgical manipulative technique," Trancore murmured. 

A strabismic attendant, called by 
the clanging of the surfeited machine, shouldered through the 
matching crowd and squinted unbelievingly. 

"Whatcha doon?" The attendant demanded menacingly. 

"Or this," Trancore said gently. 
"The same technique." 

The man pressed a hand to his 
eyes and made an animal noise. 
Then he looked at his fingers, held 
up one, two, three; blinked at the 
lights. 



FIELD STUDY 



123 



Pake grasped Trancore's arm, 
pulled him outside. He was suddenly quite sober. There was a 
strange harshness in his voice. 

"Do you have to impress me? 
The world needs your knowledge 
and" — he waved at the glitter of 
Broadway — "you fritter time and 
energy mooching around here. You 
don't cure a girl of T.B., but you 
fix that old thug's squint." 

"A whim. Alone, I can do so 
little." 

"Why do you do anything?" 

TRANCORE fingered a green 
bill reflectively. "Even a healer 
must eat. Field research is expensive. And we are pledged to live 
as far as possible within the framework of the society we examine, 
applying our skills to that end. In 
that way, we reduce the possibility 
of observation affecting the subject 
we observe. 

"By using the hypnotic and telekinetic techniques which I have 
developed in my own profession, I 
could obviously earn sufficient of 
your tokens for subsistence during 
my period of study by gambling, 
for instance; but that would not be 
ethical." 

Pake imagined a poker player 
who not only reshuffled cards as 
they were being dealt to him, but 
who could disappear, if his opponents queried his success, by erasing 
the fact of his presence from their 
minds. 

"You could teach — " he began. 



"And run foul of the witch-doctors who briefed you yesterday? 
Think, Mr. Pake! Would you give 
a hypodermic and a gallon of cocaine to an aboriginal tribe suffering from toothaches? Besides, these 
techniques have taken me five hundred years to learn." 

"That's why I thought — " 
"That I was from the future? I 
might be, in terms of possibility. 
We are," said Trancore, "no older 
than you, as a race, in terms of 
universal evolution. But as individuals, we are longer-lived. The 
biggest single advance you will 
make as a race will be when you 
increase the life-span of the individual." 

Pake thought that over, and fantasy was far from his mind. 

"You could help us," he said. 

"We may, when you become 
more than ephemerate. And, for 
psychological reasons, that must be 
achieved by your own efforts." 

"Are we so contemptible?" 

"Would we study you if you 
were? Our architects, our musicians, 
even our fiction writers do fieldwork in this territory, write scholarly theses when they return. Anthropology, in our sense of the 
term, embraces all the arts and 
sciences. We are all scholars. Occasionally we innovate, and you benefit." 

"Why do you tell me this?" 

Trancore shrugged. For the first 
time, Pake noticed that they were 
standing in the middle of a busy 



124 




 



sidewalk. They might have been 
in the middle of the Gobi desert 
for all the notice people took of 
them. A plump man walked 
straight toward them, frowned, 
then detoured carefully around the 
spot where they stood. Pake wondered what the man thought he 
saw. Probably a puddle or brokenup sidewalk. 

"I like you," Trancore said simply. "And you will remember very 
little that you can impart to others 
and expect any measure of belief. 
And you have imagination enough 
to control your terrestrial chauvinism and your natural resentment at 
being studied. It may comfort you 
to know that, in the physical 
sciences, your race is considered to 
be quite well advanced." 

It did, somehow. Yet — 

ALL the niggling, back-mindbiting inferiorities that man 
has ever suffered, from the time he 
was first chased by a sabertooth to 
his feeling of helplessness when 
science outran his emotional control, suddenly seemed to crowd together into Pake's brain for a 
staggering second. 

"Resentment isn't the word," 
Pake said slowly. "I could kill 
you." 

"But you won't. Others would. 
Now you understand why our visits 
are unannounced. And they will 
remain so until all men are as essentially civilized — that is to say, nonaggressive — as you are." 



Pake knew the question was 
really unimportant and that its true 
answer would be incomprehensible, 
anyway. But he asked it. 

Trancore smiled. "Your preoccupation with the physical sciences . . . 
No, I don't have a spaceship 
garaged anywhere. Your popular 
concept of time may be superstition, but the limiting speed of light 
is not. We don't travel. We arrive. 
I'm afraid the distinction is not 
clear to you, but it will have to do. 

"And now — " The slender man 
took Pake's arm. Crowds brushed 
against them again. "Quick visits 
to a burlesque show, an all-night 
cinema. And perhaps we could look 
in at those nightclubs where your 
wife might be. I owe you a favor. 
Then I must return home." 

They cabbed to three clubs before they found Betty. 

"You are not members, we are 
booked up, it is evening dress 
only," objected the hastily summoned manager. 

"Are you mad?" asked Trancore 
pleasantly. "Or is your memory so 
very short?" 

The manager thumb-and-fingered 
his eyes, then beamed at them. 

"Good evening, gentlemen. Good 
to see you again.. This way." 

"Teach me that trick," muttered 
Pake as they followed him. 

He looked down at his open 
overcoat and tweed suit. 

"Tell me, am I wearing a soft 
shirt or a boiled one?" 

"Boiled." 



FIELD STUDY 



125 



"Good. I like to be formal." 

Trancore stopped at the entrance 
to the big circular room. The manager left them and hurried back to 
his private office with the conviction of a frantic headache to be 
numbed with aspirin immediately. 

"Do you see her?" Trancore 
asked. 

Pake glanced around the soft-lit 
tables. He looked hard at one table. 
He made a wry face. 

"Boiled," he said, "has more 
than one meaning. Or maybe Betty 
just can't resist using that torso of 
hers as a prop. I wish she wasn't 
wearing that dress at that angle of 
inclination. Would you think me 
so uncivilized, Trancore, if I 
walked up and poked Football 
Shoulders in one of those roving 
eyes of his?" 

"You are not altogether without 
blame in this arisement," Trancore 
observed mildly. "You make insufficient allowance for her. You are 
reasonably well-adjusted. She is 
not." 

"I'd like to adjust that damned 
dress." 

"Primitive possessiveness. You 
disappoint me, Pake," Trancore 
said, but his eyes were laughing. 

Betty looked up as they approached. Her eyes weren't quite 
focused. "Frankie . . . What the 
hell! Lookit what the river washed 
up!" 

She grabbed the table for support as Football Shoulders rose 
suddenly, rubbed his forehead. 



"Phone call or — or something," he 
muttered. "Pardon me. Must go." 

Betty did a double-take like a 
puppet as the shoulders lumbered 
off. "Wheel me home. What 
goes — " 

Pake said, "Meet Mr. Trancore." 

TWO men walked slowly along 
the footpath of a great girdered 
bridge. The taller man had a hesitation in his walk and stooped a 
little, as if burdened. 

Halfway across, they stopped and 
watched in silence the slow dawn 
rose-gilding the towers of Manhattan. 

A tugboat below, looking no 
larger than a water beetle, made its 
loud, self-important noise. As much 
noise as an ocean-going liner. 

Pake had put Betty in a cab, had 
walked with Trancore, had asked 
many more questions, and learned 
very little. Now he asked the final 
question as Trancore turned and 
held out his slender hand. 

"Good-by, Mr. Pake." 

"At least tell me — which star?" 

"You haven't seen or named it 
yet. Take care of Mr. Trancore for 
me, won't you? You'll find his address in this pocket. Good-by." 

Pake took the hand. For a crazy 
moment, despite what he knew, he 
expected it to be withdrawn from 
his grasp suddenly, to see a figure 
drawn heavenward along a lancing 
path of light. 

But there was merely a sigh from 
the lips of the slender man, who 



126 




 



collapsed limply into Pake's ready 
arms. 

PAKE told his chief, "Those 
quacks can examine him until 
they drive the poor devil crazy, but 
he won't be able to tell them any 
more. His name is Chandra Trancore, a second-rate doctor who disappeared from his practice in Madras province ten months ago. He 
has less idea of what he has been 
doing during those months than 
they have." 

"How do you explain it?" 
Pake stood by the window of the 
office and inhaled deeply. Somewhere nearby there was a windowbox with gardenias. He caught their 
scent as well as if they had been 
under his nose. 

He said, "I don't. And I'd like 
you to hurry through my resignation as fast as you can, chief." 

"I still don't understand why, 
Frankie. We're pals, aren't we, 
apart from official status? I know 
I've had to drive you hard lately. 
Had to drive myself, too. Sorry I 
put you on this off-routine stunt. 
But if you want to rest up for a 
while — ■" 

Pake inhaled again, audibly. 
Someone was cooking spaghetti 
bolognese quite a distance away. "I 
want to be free to take legal action 
on behalf of Trancore if those 
witch-doctors have him arrested on 
some trumped-up charge just to 
give themselves more time to examine him. I'll take personal re


sponsibility for seeing him home 
to India." 

"You can do that without resigning. I'll fix special leave, if you 
insist on being crazy." 

"That's not all, though." Pake 
wondered how he could explain, 
regretfully decided it was impossible. "I'm taking an intensive twoyear course for a new career." 

"So you told me. I thought you 
were drunk. Anyway, how will 
Betty take to a fool idea like that? 
She goes for the bright lights, 
doesn't she? And I thought her — 
nerves were edgy." 

"She's all for it," Pake said, and 
was amused at his chief's gapemouthed disbelief. "A neurosis is a 
disease. And she met Trancore. I'll 
send you a card when we get 
started." 




[HE card arrived three years 
later. It was headed: 



M'Beli Medical Mission Station 
Upper Congo 

Pake wrote: ". . . probably the 
most backward tribe mentally and 
physically in the whole of Africa. 
Some trouble from the witch-doctors at first, but I've settled down 
quite nicely now and I think they're 
beginning to trust me, with Betty's 
help. The women love her. Tribal 
customs are fascinating. Watch out 
for my name in the Anthropological 
Review."

The Marching Morons 




128 




 




SOME things had not changed. 
A potter's wheel was still a 
potter's wheel and clay was 
still clay. Efim Hawkins had built 
his shop near Goose Lake, which 
had a narrow band of good fat clay 
and a narrow beach of white sand. 
He fired three bottle-nosed kilns 
with willow charcoal from the 
wood lot. The wood lot was also 
useful for long walks while the 
kilns were cooling; if he let himself stay within sight of them, he 
would open them prematurely, impatient to see how some new shape 
or glaze had come through the fire, 





THE MARCHING MORONS 



129 



and — ping! — the new shape or 
glaze would be good for nothing 
but the shard pile back of his slip 
tanks. 

A business conference was in full 
swing in his shop, a modest cube of 
brick, tile-roofed, as the ChicagoLos Angeles "rocket" thundered 
overhead — very noisy, very sweptback, very fiery jets, shaped as 
sleekly swift-looking as an airborne 
barracuda. 

The buyer from Marshall Fields 
was turning over a black-glazed one 
liter carafe, nodding approval with 
his massive, handsome head. "This 
is real pretty," he told Hawkins and 
his own secretary, Gomez-Laplace. 
"This has got lots of what ya call 
real est'etic principles. Yeah, it is 
real pretty." 

"How much?" the secretary asked 
the potter. 

"Seven-fifty each in dozen lots," 
said Hawkins. "I ran up fifteen 
dozen last month." 

"They are real est'etic," repeated 
the buyer from Fields. "I will take 
them all." 

"I don't think we can do that, 
doctor," said the secretary. "They'd 
cost us $1,350. That would leave 
only $532 in our quarter's budget. 
And we still have to run down to 
East Liverpool to pick up some 
cheap dinner sets." 

"Dinner sets?" asked the buyer, 
his big face full of wonder. 

"Dinner sets. The department's 
been out of them for two months 
now. Mr. Garvy-Seabright got 



pretty nasty about it yesterday. Remember?" 

"Garvy-Seabright, that meatheaded bluenose," the buyer said 
contemptuously. "He don't know 
nothin' about est'etics. Why for 
don't he lemme run my own department?" His eye fell on a stray 
copy of Whambozambo Comix and 
he sat down with it. An occasional 
deep chuckle or grunt of surprise 
escaped him as he turned the pages. 

Uninterrupted, the potter and the 
buyer's secretary quickly closed a 
deal for two dozen of the liter 
carafes. "I wish we could take 
more," said the secretary, "but you 
heard what I told him. We've had 
to turn away customers for ordinary 
dinnerware because he shot the last 
quarter's budget on some Mexican 
piggy banks some equally enthusiastic importer stuck him with. The 
fifth floor is packed solid with 
them." 

"I'll bet they look -mighty est'etic." 

"They're painted with purple 
cacti." 

THE potter shuddered and caressed the glaze of the sample 
carafe. 

The buyer looked up and rumbled, "Ain't you dummies through 
yakkin' yet? What good's a seckertary for if'n he don't take the burden of de-ti\l off'n my back, harh?" 

"We're all through, doctor. Are 
you ready to go?" 

The buyer grunted peevishly,

dropped W bambozambo Comix on 
the floor and led the way out of 
the building and down the log 
corduroy road to the highway. His 
car was waiting on the concrete. It 
was, like all contemporary cars, too 
low-slung to get over the logs. He 
climbed down into the car and 
started the motor with a tremendous sparkle and roar. 

"Gomez-Laplace," called out the 
potter under cover of the noise, 
"did anything come of the radiation program they were working on 
the last time I was on duty at the 
Pole?" 

"The same old fallacy," said the 
secretary gloomily. "It stopped us 
on mutation, it stopped us on culling, it stopped us on segregation, 
and now it's stopped us on hypnosis." 

"Well, I'm scheduled back to 
the grind in nine days. Time for 
another firing right now. I've got 
a new luster to try . . ." 

"I'll miss you. I shall be 'vacationing' — running the drafting 
room of the New Century Engineering Corporation in Denver. 
They're going to put up a two hundred-story office building, and naturally somebody's got to be on 
hand." 

"Naturally," said Hawkins with 
a sour smile. 

There was an ear-piercingly sweet 
blast as the buyer leaned on the 
horn button. Also, a yard-tall jet of 
what looked like flame spurted up 
from the car's radiator cap; the 



car's power plant was a gas turbine, 
and had no radiator. 

"I'm coming, doctor," said the 
secretary dispiritedly. He climbed 
down into the car and it whooshed 
off with much flame and noise. 

The potter, depressed, wandered 
back up the corduroy road and contemplated his cooling kilns. The 
rustling wind in the boughs was 
obscuring the creak and mutter of 
the shrinking refractory brick. 
Hawkins wondered about the number two kiln — a reduction fire on a 
load of lusterware mugs. Had the 
clay chinking excluded the air? 
Had it been a properly smoky 
blaze? Would it do any harm if he 
just took one close—? 

COMMON sense took Hawkins 
by the scruff of the neck and 
yanked him over to the tool shed. 
He got out his pick and resolutely 
set off on a prospecting jaunt to a 
hummocky field that might yield 
some oxides. He was especially low 
on coppers. 

The long walk left him sweating 
hard, with his lust for a peek into 
the kiln quiet in his breast. He 
swung his pick almost at random 
into one of the hummocks; it 
clanged on a stone which he excavated. A largely obliterated inscription said: 

ERSITY OF CHIC 
OGICAL LABO 
ELOVED MEMORY OF 
KILLED IN ACT 



THE MARCHING MORONS 



131 



The potter swore mildly. He had 
hoped the field would turn out to 
be a cemetery, preferably a oncefashionable cemetery full of oncemassive bronze caskets moldered 
into oxides of tin and copper. 

WELL, hell, maybe there was 
some around anyway. 
He headed lackadaisically for the 
second largest hillock and sliced 
into it with his pick. There was a 
stone to undercut and topple into a 
trench, and then the potter was 
very glad he'd stuck at it. His nostrils were filled with the bitter smell 
and the dirt was tinged with the 
exciting blue of copper salts. The 
pick went clang! 

Hawkins, puffing, pried up a 
stainless steel plate that was quite 
badly stained and was also marked 
with incised letters. It seemed to 
have pulled loose from rotting 
bronze; there were rivets on the 
back that brought up flakes of green 
patina. The potter wiped off the 
surface dirt with his sleeve, turned 
it to catch the sunlight obliquely 
and read: 

"HONEST JOHN BARLOW 

"Honest John," famed in university annals, represents a challenge 
which medical science has not yet 
answered: revival of a human being accidentally thrown into a state 
of suspended animation. 

In 1988 Mr. Barlow, a leading 
Evanston real estate dealer, visited 
his dentist for treatment of an im


pacted wisdom tooth. His dentist 
requested and received permission 
to use the experimental anesthetic 
Cycloparadimethanol-B-7 , developed at the University. 

After administration of the anesthetic, the dentist resorted to his 
drill. By freakish mischance, a short 
circuit in his machine delivered 220 
volts of 60-cycle current into the 
patient. (In a damage suit instituted by Mrs. Barlow against the 
dentist, the University and the 
makers of the drill, a jury found 
for the defendants.) Mr. Barlow 
never got up from the dentist's 
chair and was assumed to have died 
of poisoning, electrocution or both. 

Morticians preparing him for 
embalming discovered, however, 
that their subject was — though certainly not living — just as certainly 
not dead. The University was notified and a series of exhaustive tests 
was begun, including attempts to 
duplicate the trance state on volunteers. After a bad run of seven cases 
which ended fatally, the attempts 
were abandoned. 

Honest fohn was long an exhibit 
at the University museum, and 
livened many a football game as 
mascot of the University's Blue 
Crushers. The bounds of taste were 
overstepped, however, when a 
pledge to Sigma Delta Chi was ordered in '03 to "kidnap" Honest 
John from his loosely guarded glass 
museum case and introduce him 
into the Rachel Swanson Memorial 
Girls' Gymnasium shower room. 



132 




 



On May 22nd, 2003, the University Board of Regents issued the 
following order: "By unanimous 
vote, it is directed that the remains 
of Honest John Barlow be removed 
from the University museum and 
conveyed to the University's Lieutenant fames Scott III Memorial 
Biological Laboratories and there be 
securely locked in a specially prepared t/ault. It is further directed 
that all possible measures for the 
preservation of these remains be 
taken by the Laboratory administration and that access to these remains 
be denied to all persons except 
qualified scholars authorized in 
writing by the Board. The Board 
reluctantly takes this action in view 
of recent notices and photographs 
in the nation's press which, to say 
the least, reflect but small credit 
upon the University." 

IT WAS far from his field, but 
Hawkins understood what had 
happened — an early and accidental 
blundering onto the bare bones of 
the Levantman shock anesthesia, 
which had since been replaced by 
other methods. To bring subjects 
out of Levantman shock, you let 
them have a squirt of simple saline 
in the trigeminal nerve. Interesting. And now about that bronze — 
He heaved the pick into the rotting green salts, expecting no resistence, and almost fractured his 
wrist. Something down there was 
solid. He began to flake off the oxides. 



A half hour of work brought him 
down to phosphor bronze, a huge 
casting of the almost incorruptiblemetal. It had weakened structurally 
over the centuries; he could fit the 
point of his pick under a corroded 
boss and pry off great creaking and 
grumbling striae of the stuff. 

Hawkins wished he had an 
archeologist with him, but didn't 
dream of returning to his shop and 
calling one to take over the find. 
He was an all-around man: by 
choice and in his free time, an artist 
in clay and glaze; by necessity, an 
automotive, electronics and atomic 
engineer who could also swing a 
project in traffic control, individual 
and group psychology, architecture 
or tool design. He didn't yell for 
a specialist every time something 
out of his line came up; there were 
so few with so much to do . . . 

He trenched around his find, discovering that it was a great brickshaped bronze mass with an excitingly hollow sound. A long strip 
of moldering metal from one of 
the long vertical faces pulled away, 
exposing red rust that went whoosh 
and was sucked into the interior of 
the mass. 

It had been de-aired, thought 
Hawkins, and there must have been 
an inner jacket of glass which had 
crystalized through the centuries 
and quietly crumbled at the first 
clang of his pick. He didn't know 
what a vacuum would do to a subject of Levantman shock, but hehad hopes, nor did he quite under


THE MARCHING MORONS 



133 



stand what a real estate dealer was, 
but it might have something to do 
with pottery. And anything might 
have a bearing on Topic Number 
One. 

HE FLUNG his pick out of the 
trench, climbed out and set off 
at a dog-trot for his shop. A little 
rummaging turned up a hypo and 
there was a plasticontainer of salt 
in the kitchen. 

Back at his dig, he chipped for 
another half hour to expose the 
juncture of lid and body. The 
hinges were hopeless; he smashed 
them off. 

Hawkins extended the telescopic 
handle of the pick for the best 
leverage, fitted its point into a deep 
pit, set its built-in fulcrum, and 
heaved. Five more heaves and he 
could see, inside the vault, what 
looked like a dtfsty marble statue. 
Ten more and he could see that it 
was the naked body of Honest John 
Barlow, Evanston real estate dealer, 
uncorrupted by time. 

The potter found the apex of the 
trigeminal nerve with his needle's 
point and gave him 60 ccr 

In an hour Barlow's chest began 
to pump. 

In another hour, he rasped, "Did 
it work?" 

"Did it!" muttered Hawkins. 
Barlow opened his eyes and 
stirred, looked down, turned his 
hands before his eyes — 

"I'll sue!" he screamed. "My 
clothes! My fingernails!" A horrid 



suspicion came over his face and 
he clapped his hands to his hairless scalp. "My hair!" he wailed. 
"I'll sue you for every penny you've 
got ! That release won't mean a 
damned thing in court — I didn't 
sign away my hair and clothes and 
fingernails !" 

"They'll grow back," said Hawkins casually. "Also your epidermis. 
Those parts of you weren't alive, 
you know, so they weren't preserved 
like the rest of you. I'm afraid the 
clothes are gone, though." 

"What is this — the University 
hospital?" demanded Barlow. "I 
want a phone. No, you phone. Tell 
my wife I'm all right and tell Sam 
Immerman — he's my lawyer — to get 
over here right away. Greenleaf 
7-4022. Ow!" He had tried to sit 
up, and a portion of his pink skin 
rubbed against the inner surface of 
the casket, which was powdered by 
the ancient crystalized glass. "What 
the hell did you guys do, boil me 
alive? Oh, you're going to pay for 
this!" 

"You're all right," said Hawkins, wishing now he had a reference book to clear up several 
obscure terms. "Your epidermis 
will start growing immediately. 
You're not in the hospital. Look 
here." 

HE HANDED Barlow the stainless steel plate that had 
labeled the casket. After a suspicious glance, the man started to 
read. Finishing, he laid the plate 



134 




 



carefully on the edge of the vault 
and was silent for a spell. 

"Poor Verna," he said at last. 
"It doesn't say whether she was 
stuck with the court costs. Do you 
happen to know — " 

"No," said the potter. "All I 
know is what was on the plate, and 
how to revive you. The dentist accidentally gave you a dose of what 
we call Levantman shock anesthesia. 
We haven't used it for centuries; it 
was powerful, but too dangerous." 

"Centuries . . ." brooded the 
man. "Centuries . . . I'll bet Sam 
swindled her out of her eyeteeth. 
Poor Verna. How long ago was it? 
What year is this?" 

Hawkins shrugged. "We call k 
7-B-936. That's no help to you. It 
takes a long time for these metals 
to oxidize." 

"Like that movie," Barlow muttered. "Who would have thought 
it? Poor Verna!" He blubbered and 
sniffled, reminding Hawkins powerfully of the fact 'that he had been 
found under a flat rock. 

Almost angrily, the potter demanded, "How many children did 
you have?" 

"None yet," sniffed Barlow. "My 
first wife didn't want them. But 
Verna wants one — wanted one — 
but we're going to wait until — we 
were going to wait until — " 

"Of course," said the potter, 
feeling a savage desire to tell him 
off, blast him to hell and gone for 
his work. But he choked it down. 
There was The Problem to think 



of; there was always The Problem 
to think of, and this poor blubberer might unexpectedly supply a 
clue. Hawkins would have to pass 
him on. 

"/"^lOME along," Hawkins said. 

\J "My time is short." 

Barlow looked up, outraged. 
"How can you be so unfeeling? 
I'm a human being like — " ■ 

The Los Angeles-Chicago 
"rocket" thundered overhead and 
Barlow broke off in mid-complaint. 
"Beautiful !" he breathed, following 
it with his eyes. "Beautiful!" 

He climbed out of the vault, too 
interested to be pained by its roughness against his infantile skin. 
"After all," he said briskly, "this 
should have its sunny side. I never 
was much for reading, but this is 
just like one of those stories. And 
I ought to make some money out 
of it, shouldn't I?" He gave Hawkins a shrewd glance. 

"You want money?" asked the 
potter. "Here." He handed over a 
fistful of change and bills. "You'd 
better put my shoes on. It'll be 
about a quarter-mile. Oh, and 
you're — uh, modest? — yes, that was 
the word. Here." Hawkins gave 
him his pants, but Barlow was excitedly counting the money. 

"Eighty-five, eighty-six — and it's 
dollars, too ! I thought it'd be credits or whatever they call them. 'E 
Pluribus Unum' and 'Liberty' — just 
different faces. Say, is there a catch 
to this? Are these real, genuine, 



THE MARCHING MORONS 



135 



honest twenty- two-cent dollars like 
we had or just wallpaper?" 

"They're quite all right, I assure 
you," said the potter. "I wish you'd 
come along. I'm in a 'hurry." 

THE man babbled as they 
stumped toward the shop. 
"Where are we going — The Council of Scientists, the World Coordinator or something, like that?" 

"Who? Oh, no. We call them 
'President' and 'Congress.' No, that 
wouldn't do any good at all. I'm 
just taking you to see some people." 

"I ought to make plenty out of 
this. Plenty! I could write books. 
Get some smart young fellow to 
put it into words for me and I'll 
bet I could turn out a best-sellet. 
What's the setup on things like 
that?" 

"It's about like that. Smart 
young fellows. But there aren't any 
best-sellers any more. People don't 
read much nowadays. We'll find 
something equally profitable for 
you to do." 

Back in the shop, Hawkins gave 
Barlow a suit of clothes, deposited 
him in the waiting room and called 
Central in Chicago. "Take him 
away," he pleaded. "I have time 
for one more firing and he blathers 
and blathers. I haven't told him 
anything. Perhaps we should just 
turn him loose and let him find his 
own level, but there's a chance — " 

"The Problem," agreed Central. 
"Yes, there's a chance." 

The potter delighted Barlow by 



making him a cup of coffee with 
a cube that not only dissolved in 
cold water but heated the water to 
boiling point. Killing time, Hawkins chatted about the "rocket" 
Barlow had admired, and had to 
haul himself up short; he had almost told the real estate man what 
its top speed really was — almost, 
indeed, revealed that it was not a 
rocket. 

He regretted, too, that he had so 
casually handed Barlow a couple of 
hundred dollars. The man seemed 
obsessed with fear that they were 
worthless since Hawkins refused to 
take a note or I.O.U. or even a 
definite promise of repayment. But 
Hawkins couldn't go into details, 
and was very glad when a stranger 
arrived from Central. 

"Tinny-Peete, from Algeciras," 
the stranger told him swiftly as the 
two of them met at the door. "Psychist for Poprob. Polasigned special 
overtake Barlow." 

"Thank Heaven," said Hawkins. 
"Barlow," he told the man from 
the past, "this is Tinny-Peete. He's 
going to take care of you and help 
you make lots of money." 

The psychist stayed for a cup of 
the coffee whose preparation had 
delighted Barlow, and then conducted the real estate man down 
the corduroy road to his car, leaving the potter to speculate on 
whether he could at last crack his 
kilns. 

Hawkins, abruptly dismissing 
Barlow and the Problem, happily 



136 




 



picked the chinking from around 
the door of the number two kiln, 
prying it open a trifle. A blast of 
heat and the heady, smoky scent of 
the reduction fire delighted him. 
He peered and saw a corner of a 
shelf glowing cherry-red, becoming 
obscured by wavering black areas 
as it lost heat through the opened 
door. He slipped a charred wood 
paddle under a mug on the shelf 
and pulled it out as a sample, the 
hairs on the back of his hand curling and scorching. The mug crackled and pinged and Hawkins sighed 
happily. 

The bismuth resinate luster had 
fired to perfection, a haunting film 
of silvery-black metal with strange 
bluish lights in it as it turned before the eyes, and the Problem of 
Population seemed very far away 
to Hawkins then. 

BARLOW and Tinny-Peete 
arrived at the concrete highway where the psychist's car was 
parked in a safety bay. 

"What — a — boat!" gasped the 
man from the past. 

"Boat? No, that's my car." 
Barlow surveyed it with awe. 
Swept-back lines, deep-drawn compound curves, kilograms of chrome. 
He ran his hands futilely over the 
door — or was it the door? — in a 
futile search for a handle, and 
asked respectfully, "How fast does 
it go?" 

The psychist gave him a keen 
look and said slowly, "Two hun


dred and fifty. You can tell by the 
speedometer." 

"Wow! My old Ghewy could 
hit a hundred on a straightaway, 
but you're out of my class, mister!" 

Tinny-Peete somehow got a 
huge, low door open and Barlow 
descended three steps into immense 
cushions, floundering over to the 
right. He was too fascinated to pay 
serious attention to his flayed dermis. The dashboard was a lovely 
wilderness of dials, plugs, indicators, lights, scales and switches. 

The psychist climbed down into 
the driver's seat and did something 
with his feet. The motor started 
like lighting a blowtorch as big as 
a silo. Wallowing around in the 
cushions, Barlow saw through a 
rear-view mirror a tremendous exhaust filled with brilliant white 
sparkles. 

"Do you like it?" yelled the 
psychist. 

"It's terrific!" Barlow yelled 
back. "It's — " 

He was shut up as the car pulled 
out from the bay into the road 
with a great voo-ooo-ooom! A gale 
roared past Barlow's head, though 
the windows seemed to be closed; 
the impression of speed was terrific. 
He located the speedometer on the 
dashboard and saw it climb past 
90, 100, 150, 200. 

"Fast enough for me," yelled 
the psychist, noting that Barlow's 
face fell in response. "Radio?" 

He passed over a surprisingly 



THE MARCHING MORONS 



137 



light object like a football helmet, 
with no trailing wires, and pointed 
to a row of buttons. Barlow put on 
the helmet, glad to have the roar 
of air stilled, and pushed a pushbutton. It lit up satisfyingly and 
Barlow settled back even farther 
for a sample of the brave new 
world's super-modern taste in ingenious entertainment. 

"TAKE IT AND STICK IT!" 
a voice roared in his ears. 



HE SNATCHED off the helmet 
and gave the psychist an injured look. Tinny-Peete grinned 
and turned a dial associated with 
the pushbutton layout. The man 
from the past donned the helmet 
again and found the voice had 
lowered to normal. 

"The show of shows ! The supershow ! The super-duper show ! The 
quiz of quizzes ! Take it and stick 
it!" 



138 




 




There were shrieks of laughter 
in the background. 

"Here we got the contes-tants all 
ready to go. You know how we 
work it. I hand a contes-tant a 
triangle-shaped cutout and like that 
down the line. Now we got these 
here boards, they got cut-out places 
the same shape as the triangles and 
things, only they're all different 
shapes, and the first contes-tant that 



sticks the cutouts into the board, 
he wins. 

"Now I'm gonna innaview the 
first contes-tant. Right here, honey. 
What's your name?" 

"Name? Uh — " 

"Hoddaya like that, folks? She 
don't remember her name! Hah? 
W ould you buy that for a quarter?" The question was spoken 
with arch significance, and the au

dience shrieked, howled and 
whistled its appreciation. 

It was dull listening when you 
didn't know the punch lines and 
catch lines. Barlow pushed another 
button, with his free hand ready 
at the volume control. 

" — latest from Washington. It's 
about Senator Hull-Mendoza. He is 
still attacking the Bureau of Fisheries. The North California Syndicalist says he got affidavits that 
John Kingsley-Schultz is a bluenose 
from way back. He didn't publistat 
the affydavits, but he says they say 
that Kingsley-Schultz was saw at 
bluenose meetings in Oregon State 
College and later at Florida University. Kingsley-Schultz says he 
gotta confess he did major in flycasting at Oregon and got his 
Ph.D. in game-fish at Florida. 

"And here is a quote from 
Kingsley-Schultz: 'Hull-Mendoza 
don't know what he's talking about. 
He should drop dead.' Unquote. 
Hull-Mendoza says he won't publistat the affydavits to pertect his 
sources. He says they was sworn 
by three former employes of the 
Bureau which was fired for in-competence and in-com-pat-ibility by 
Kingsley-Schultz. 

"Elsewhere they was the usual 
run of traffic accidents. A three-way 
pileup of cars on Route 66 going 
outta Chicago took twelve lives. 
The Chicago-Los Angeles morning

people aboard got killed. A Civil 
Aeronautics Authority investigator 
on the scene says that the pilot was

to study the wreckage, but they

seemed so callous," he yelled at 
the driver. "I was listening to a 
newscast — " 

Tinny-Peete shook his head and 
pointed at his ears. The roar of 
air was deafening. Barlow frowned 
baffledly and stared out of the window. 

A glowing sign said: 

MOOGS! 
WOULD YOU BUY IT 
FOR A QUARTER? 

He didn't know what Moogs was 
or were; the illustration showed an 
incredibly proportioned girl, 99-9 
per cent naked, writhing passionately in animated full color. 



140 




 



The roadside jingle was still 
with him, but with a new feature. 
Radar or something sported the car 
and alerted the lines of the jingle. 
Each in turn sped along a roadside 
track, even with the car, so it could 
be read before the next line was 
alerted. 

IF THERE'S A GIRL 
YOU WANT TO GET 
DEFLOOCULIZE 
UNROMANTIC SWEAT. 

"A*R*M*P*I*T*T*0" 

Another animated job, in two 
panels, the familiar "Before and 
After." The first said, "Just Any 
Cigar?" and was illustrated with a 
two-person domestic tragedy of a 
wife holding her nose while her 
coarse and red-faced husband puffed 
a slimy-looking rope. The second 
panel glowed, "Or a VUELTA 
ABA JO?" and was illustrated 
with — 

Barlow blushed and looked at his 
feet until they had passed the sign. 

"Coming into Chicago!" bawled 
Tinny-Peete. 

Other cars were showing up, all 
of them dreamboats. 

Watching them, Barlow began to 
wonder if he knew what a kilometer was, exactly. They seemed to 
be traveling so slowly, if you 
ignored the roaring air past your 
ears and didn't let the speedy line:; 
of the dreamboats fool you. He 
would have sworn they were really 
crawling along at twenty-five, with 



occasional spurts up to thirty. How 
much was a kilometer, anyway? 

The city loomed ahead, and it 
was just what it ought to be: towering skyscrapers, overhead ramps, 
landing platforms for helicopters — 

He clutched at the cushions. 
Those two 'copters. They were going to — they were going to — 
they — 

He didn't see what happened 
because their apparent collision 
courses took them behind a giant 
building. 

SCREAMINGLY sweet blasts of 
sound surrounded them as they 
stopped for a red light. "What the 
hell is going on here?" said Barlow in a shrill, frightened voice, 
because the braking time was just 
about zero, he wasn't hurled 
against the dashboard. "Who's 
kidding who?" 

"Why, what's the matter?" demanded the driver. 

The light changed to green and 
he started the pickup. Barlow 
stiffened as he realized that the 
rush of air past his ears began just 
a brief, unreal split-second before 
the car was actually moving. He 
grabbed for the door handle on 'his 
side. 

The city grew on them slowly: 
scattered buildings, denser buildings, taller buildings, and a red 
light ahead. The car rolled to a 
stop in zero braking time, the rush 
of air cut off an instant after it 
stopped, and Barlow was out of 



THE MARCHING MORONS 



141 



the car and running frenziedly 
down a sidewalk one instant after 
that. 

They'll track me down, he 
thought, panting. It's a secret police thing. They'll get you — mindreading machines, television eyes 
everywhere, afraid you'll tell their 
slaves about freedom and stuff. 
They don't let anybody cross them, 
like that story I once read. 

Winded, he slowed to a walk 
and congratulated himself that he 
had guts enough not to turn 
around. That was what they always 
watched for. Walking, he was just 
another business-suited back among 
hundreds. He would be safe, he 
would be safe — 

A hand tumbled from a large, 
coarse, handsome face thrust close 
to his: "Wassamatta bumpinninna 
people likeya owna sidewalk gotta 
miner slamya inna mushya bassar!" 
It was neither the mad potter nor 
the mad driver. 

"Excuse me," said Barlow. 
"What did you say?" 

"Oh, yeah?" yelled the stranger 
dangerously, and waited for an answer. 

Barlow, with the feeling that he 
had somehow been suckered into 
the short end of an intricate landtitle deal, heard himself reply belligerently, "Yeah!" 

The stranger let go of his shoulder and snarled, "Oh, yeah?" 

"Yeah!" said Barlow, yanking 
his jacket back into shape. 

"Aaah!" snarled the stranger, 

142 



with more contempt and disgust 
than ferocity. He added an obscenity current in Barlow 's time, a 
standard but physiologically impossible directive, and strutted off 
hulking his shoulders and balling 
his fists. 

BARLOW walked on, trembling. 
Evidently he had handled it 
well enough. He stopped at a red 
light while the long, low dreamboats roared before him and pedestrains in the sidewalk flow with 
him threaded their ways through 
the stream of cars. Brakes screamed, 
fenders clanged and dented, hoarse 
cries flew back and forth between 
drivers and walkers. He leaped 
backward frantically as one car 
swerved over an arc of sidewalk 
to miss another. 

The signal changed to green, the 
cars kept on coming for about 
thirty seconds and then dwindled 
to an occasional light-runner. Barlow crossed warily and leaned 
against a vending machine, blowing 
big breaths. 

Look natural, he told himself. 
Do something normal. Buy something from the machine. 

He fumbled out some change, 
got a newspaper for a dime, a 
handkerchief for a quarter and a 
candy bar for another quarter. 

The faint chocolate smell made 
him ravenous suddenly. He clawed 
at the glassy wrapper printed 
"CRIGGLIES" quite futilely for a 
few seconds, and then it divided 


 



neatly by itself. The bar made three 
good bites, and he bought two more 
and gobbled them down. 

Thirsty, he drew a carbonated 
orange drink in another one of the 
glassy wrappers from the machine 
for another dime. When he fumbled with it, it divided neatly and 
spilled all over his knees. Barlow 
decided he had been there long 
enough and walked on. 

The shop windows were — shop 
windows. People still wore and 
bought clothes, still smoked and. 
bought tobacco, still ate and bought 
food. And they still went to the 
movies, he saw with pleased surprise as he passed and then returned to a glittering place whose 
sign said it was THE BIJOU. 

The place seemed to be showing 
a quintuple feature, Babies Are 
Terrible, Don't Have Children, and 
The Canali Kid. 

It was irresistible; he paid a dollar and went in. 

He caught the tail-end of The 
Canali Kid in three-dimensional, 
full-color, full-scent production. It 
appeared to be an interplanetary 
saga winding up with a chase scene 
and a reconciliation between 
estranged hero and heroine. Babies 
Are Terrible and Don't Have Children were fantastic arguments 
against parenthood — the grotesquely exaggerated dangers of painfully 
graphic childbirth, vicious children, 
old parents beaten and starved by 
their sadistic offspring. The audience, Barlow astoundedly noted, 



was placidly champing sweets and 
showing no particular signs of revulsion. 

The Coming Attractions drove 
him into the lobby. The fanfares 
were shattering, the blazing colors 
blinding, and the added scents 
stomach-heaving. 

WHEN his eyes again became 
accustomed to the moderate 
lighting of the lobby, he groped 
his way to a bench and opened the 
newspaper he had bought. It turned 
out to be The Racing Sheet, which 
afflicted him with a crushing sense 
of loss. The familiar boxed index 
in the lower left hand corner of 
the front page showed almost unbearably that Churchill Downs and 
Empire City were still in business — 

Blinking back tears, he turned 
to the Past Performances at 
Churchill. They weren't using 
abbreviations any more, and the 
pages because of that were singlecolumn instead of double. But it 
was all the same — or was it? 

He squinted at the first race, a 
three-quarter-mile maiden claimer 
for thirteen hundred dollars. Incredibly, the track record was two 
minutes, ten and three-fifths seconds. Any beetle in his time could 
have knocked off the three-quarter 
in one-fifteen. It was the same for 
the other distances, much worse for 
route events. 

What the hell had happened to 
everything?

He studied the form of a fiveyear-old brown mare in the second 
and couldn't make head or tail of 
it. She'd won and lost and placed 
and showed and lost and placed 
without rhyme or reason. She 
looked like a front-runner for a 
couple of races and then she looked 
like a no-good pig and then she 
looked like a mudder but the next 
time it rained she wasn't and then 
she was a stayer and then she was 
a pig again. In a good five-thousand-dollar allowances event, too! 

Barlow looked at the other entries and it slowly dawned on him 
that they were all like the five-yearold brown mare. Not a single 
damned horse running had the 
slightest trace of class. 

Somebody sat down beside him 
and said, "That's the story." 

BARLOW whirled to his feet 
and saw it was tinny-Peete, his 
driver. 

"I was in doubts about telling 
you," said the psychist, "but I see 
you have some growing suspicions 
of the truth. Please don't get excited. It's all right, I tell you." 

"So you've got me," said Barlow. 

"Got you?" 

"Don't pretend. I can put two 
and two together. You're the secret 
police. You and the rest of the aristocrats live in luxury on the sweat 
of these oppressed slaves. You're 
afraid of me because you have to 
keep them ignorant." 

There was a bellow of bright 



laughter from the psychist that got 
them blank looks from other patrons of the lobby. The laughter 
didn't sound at all sinister. 

"Let's get out of here," said 
Tinny-Peete, still chuckling. "You 
couldn't possibly have it more 
wrong." He engaged Barlow's arm 
and led him to the street. "The actual truth is that the millions of 
workers live in luxury on the sweat 
of the handful of aristocrats. I shall 
probably die before my time of 
overwork unless — " He gave Barlow a speculative look. "You may 
be able to help us." 

"I know that gag," sneered Barlow. "I made money in my time 
and to make money you have to 
get people on your side. Go ahead 
and shoot me if you want, but 
you're not going to make a fool 
out of me." 

"You nasty little ingrate!" 
snapped the psychist, with a kaleidoscopic change of mood. "This 
damned mess is all your fault and 
the fault of people like you! Now 
come along and no more of your 
nonsense." 

He yanked Barlow into an office 
building lobby and an elevator that, 
disconcertingly, went whoosh loudly as it rose. The real estate man's 
knees were wobbly as the psychist 
pushed him from the elevator, 
down a corridor and into an office. 

A hawk-faced man rose from a 
plain chair as the door closed behind them. After an angry look at 
Barlow, he asked the psychist, 



144 




 



"Was I called from the Pole to 
inspect this— this — ?" 

"Unget updandered. I've deeprobed etfind quasichance exhim 
Poprobattackline," said the psychist 
soothingly. 

"Doubt," grunted the hawkfaced man. 

"Try," suggested Tinny-Peete. 

"Very well. Mr. Barlow, I understand you and your lamented 
had no children." 

"What of it?" 

"This of it. You were a blind, 
selfish stupid ass to tolerate economic and social conditions which 
penalized child-bearing by the prudent and foresighted. You made us 
what we are today, and I want you 
to know that we are far from satisfied. Damn-fool rockets! Damnfool automobiles! Damn-fool cities 
with overhead ramps!" 

"As far as I can see," said Barlow, "you're running down the 
best features of time. Are you 
crazy?" 

"The rockets aren't rockets. 
They're turbo-jets — good turbo-jets, 
but the fancy shell around them 
makes for a bad drag. The automobiles have a top speed of one hundred kilometers per hour — a kilometer is, if I recall my paleolinguistscs, three-fifths of a mile — and the 
speedometers are all rigged accordingly so the drivers will think 
they're going two hundred and fifty. 
The cities- are ridiculous, expensive, 
unsanitary, wasteful conglomerations of people who'd be better off 



and more productive if they were 
spread over the countryside. 

"We need the rockets and trick 
speedometers and cities because, 
while you and your kind were being 
prudent and foresighted and not 
having children, the migrant workers, slum dwellers and tenant farmers were shiftlessly and shortsightedly having children — breeding, breeding. My God, how they 
bred!" 

"TT7AIT a minute," objected 
VV Barlow. "There were lots 
of people in our crowd who had 
two or three children." 

"The attrition of accidents, illness, wars and such took care of 
that. Your intelligence was bred 
out. It is gone. Children that 
should have been born never were. 
The just-average, they'll-get-along 
majority took over the population. 
The average IQ now is 45." 
"But that's far in the future — " 
"So are you," grunted the hawkfaced man sourly. 

"But who are you people?" 
"Just people — real people. Some 
generations ago, the geneticists 
realized at last that nobody was 
going to pay any attention to what 
they said, so they abandoned words 
for deeds. Specifically, they formed 
and recruited for a closed corporation intended to maintain and improve the breed. We are their descendants, about three million of 
us. There are five billion of the 
others, so we are their slaves. 



THE MARCHING MORONS

"During the past couple of years 
I've designed a skyscraper, kept 
Billings Memorial Hospital here 
in Chicago running, headed off war 
with Mexico and directed traffic at 
LaGuardia Field in New York." 

"I don't understand! Why don't 
you let them go to hell in their 
own way?" 

The man grimaced. "We tried 
it once for three months. We holed 
up at the South Pole and waited. 
They didn't notice it. Some drafting-room people were missing, 
some chief nurses didn't show up, 
minor government people on the 
non-policy level couldn't be located. It didn't seem to matter. 

"In a week there was hunger. 
In two weeks there were famine 
and plague, in three weeks war 
and anarchy. We called off the 
experiment; it took us most of the 
next generation to get things 
squared away again." 

"But why didn't you let them 
kill each other off?" 

"Five billion corpses mean about 
five hundred million tons of rotting flesh." 

Barlow had another idea. "Why 
don't you steril^e them?" 

"Two and one-half billion operations is a lot of operations. Because they breed continuously, the 
job would never be done." 

"I see. Like the marching Chinese!" 

"Who the devil are they?" 
"It was a — uh — paradox of my 
time. Somebody figured out that if 



all the Chinese in the world were 
to line up four abreast, I think it 
was, and start marching past a 
given point, they'd never stop because of the babies that would be 
born and grow up before they 
passed the point." 

"That's right. Only instead of 
'a given point,' make it 'the largest conceivable number of operating rooms that we could build and 
staff.' There could never be 
enough." 

"Say!" said Barlow. "Those 
movies about babies — was that 
your propaganda?" 

"It was. It doesn't seem to mean 
a thing to them. We have abandoned the idea of attempting 
propaganda contrary to a biological drive." 

"So if you work with a biological drive — ?" 

"I know of none which is consistent with inhibition of fertility." 

BARLOW'S face went pokerblank, the result of years of 
careful discipline. "You don't, 
huh? You're the great brains and 
you can't think of any?" 

"Why, no," said the psychist innocently. "Can you?" 

"That depends. I sold ten thousand acres of Siberian tundra — 
through a dummy firm, of course 
— after the partition of Russia. The 
buyers thought they were getting 
improved building lots on the outskirts of Kiev. I'd say that was a 
lot tougher than this job." 



146 




 



"How so?" asked the hawkfaced man. 

"Those were normal, suspicious 
customers and these are morons, 
born suckers. You just figure out a 
con they'll fall for; they won't 
know enough to do any smart 
checking." 

The psychist and the hawk-faced 
man had also had training; they 
kept themselves from looking with 
sudden hope at each other. 

"You seem to have something 
in mind," said the psychist. 

Barlow's poker face went 
blanker still. "Maybe I have. I 
haven't heard any offer yet." 

"There's the satisfaction of 
knowing that> you've prevented 
Earth's resources from being so 
plundered," the hawk-faced man 
pointed out, "that the race will 
soon become extinct." 

"I don't know that," Barlow 
said bluntly. "All I have is your 
word." 

"If you really have a method, 
I don't think any price would be 
too great," the psychist offered. 

"Money," said Barlow. 

"All you want." 

"More than you want," the 
hawk-faced man corrected. 

"Prestige," added Barlow. 
"Plenty of publicity. My picture 
and my name in the papers and 
over TV every day, statues to me, 
parks and cities and streets and 
other things named after me. A 
whole chapter in the history 
books." 



The psychist made a- facial sign 
to the hawk-faced man that meant, 
"Oh, brother!" 

The hawk-faced man signaled 
back, "Steady, boy!" 

"It's not too much to ask," the 
psychist agreed. 

Barlow, sensing a seller's market, said, "Power!" 

"Power?" the hawk-faced man 
repeated puzzledly. "Your own 
hydro station or nuclear pile?" 

"I mean a world dictatorship 
with me as dictator!" 

"Well, now — " said the psychist, but the hawk-faced man interrupted, "It would take a special 
emergency act of Congress but the 
situation warrants it. I think that 
can be guaranteed." 

"Could you give us some indication of your plan?" the psychist 
asked. 

"Ever hear of lemmings?" 
"No." 

"They are — were, I guess, since 
you haven't heard of them — little 
animals in Norway, and every few 
years they'd swarm to the coast and 
swim out to sea until they 
drowned. I figure on putting some 
lemming urge into the population." 

"How?" 

"I'll save that till I get the right 
signatures on the deal." 

THE hawk-faced man said, "I'd 
like to work with you on it, 
Barlow. My name's Ryan-Ngana." 
He put out his hand. 

Barlow looked' closely at the 



THE MARCHING MORONS 



147 



hand, then at the man's face. "Ryan 
what?" 
"Ngana." 

"That sounds like an African 
name." 

"It is. My mother's father was 
a Watusi." 

Barlow didn't take the hand. "I 
thought you looked pretty dark. I 
don't want to hurt your feelings, 
but I don't think I'd be at my best 
working with you. There must be 
somebody else just as well qualified, I'm sure." 

The psychist made a facial sign 
to Ryan-Ngana that meant, "Steady 
yourself, boy!" 

"Very well," Ryan-Ngana told 
Barlow. "We'll see what arrangement can be made." 

"It's not that I'm prejudiced, you 
understand. Some of my best 
friends — " 

"Mr. Barlow, don't give it another thought. Anybody who could 
pick on the lemming analogy is going to be useful to us." 

And so he would, thought RyanNgana, alone in the office after 
Tinny-Peete had taken Barlow up 
to the helicopter stage. So he 
would. Poprob had exhausted every 
rational attempt and the new 
Poprobattacklines would have to be 
irrational or sub-rational. This creature from the past with his lemming legends and his improved 
building lots would be a fountain 
of precious vicious self-interest. 

Ryan-Ngana sighed and 
stretched. He had to go and run 



the San Francisco subway. Summoned early from the Pole to 
study Barlow, he'd left unfinished 
a nice little theorem. Between interruptions, he was slowly constructing an n-dimensional geometry 
whose foundations and superstructure owed no debt whatsoever to 
intuition. 

UPSTAIRS, waiting for a helicopter, Barlow was explaining 
to Tinny-Peete that he had nothing 
against Negroes, .and Tinny-Peete 
wished he had some of RyanNgana's imperturbability and humor for the ordeal. 

The helicopter took them to International Airport where, TinnyPeete explained, Barlow would 
leave for the Pole. 

The man from the past wasn't 
sure he'd like a dreary waste of ice 
and cold. 

"It's all right," said the psychist. 
"A civilized layout. Warm, pleasant. You'll be able to work more 
efficiently there. All the facts at 
your fingertips, a good secretary — " 
"I'll ireed a pretty big staff," said 
Barlow, who had learned from 
thousands of deals never to take 
the first offer. 

"I meant a private, confidential 
one," said Tinny-Peete readily, 
"but you can have as many as you 
want. You'll naturally have topprimary-top priority if you really 
have a workable plan." 

"Let's not forget this dictatorship 
angle," said Barlow. 



148 




 



He didn't know that the psychist 
would just as readily have promised him deification to get him 
happily on the "rocket" for the 
Pole. Tinny-Peete had no wish to 
be torn limb from limb; he knew 
very well that it would end that 
way if the population learned from 
this anachronism that there was a 
small elite which considered itself 
head, shoulders, trunk and groin 
above the rest. The fact that this 
assumption was perfectly true and 
the fact that the elite was condemned by its superiority to a life 
of the most grinding toil would 
not be considered; the difference 
would. 

The psychist finally put Barlow 
aboard the "rocket" with some 
thirty people — real people — headed 
for the Pole. 

BARLOW was airsick all the 
way because of a post-hypnotic 
suggestion Tinny-Peete had planted 
in him. One idea was to make him 
as averse as possible to a return 
trip, and another idea was to spare 
the other passengers from his aggressive, talkative company. 

Barlow during the first day at 
the pole was reminded of his first 
day in the Army. It was the 
same now-where-the-hell-are-we-going-to-put-joa ? business until he 
took a firm line with them. Then 
instead of acting like supply sergeants they acted like hotel clerks. 

It was a wonderful, wonderfully 
calculated buildup, and one that he 



failed to suspect. After all, in his 
time a visitor from the past would 
have been lionized. 

At day's end he reclined in a 
snug underground billet with the 
60-mile gales roaring yards overhead, and tried to put two and 
two together. 

It was like old times, he thought 
— like a coup in real estate where 
you had the competition by the 
throat, like a 50-per cent rent boost 
when you knew damned well there 
was no place for the tenants to 
move, like smiling when you read 
over the breakfast orange juice that 
the city council had decided to build 
a school on the ground you had 
acquired by a deal with the city 
council. And it was simple. He 
would just sell tundra building lots 
to eagerly suicidal lemmings, and 
that was absolutely all there was 
to solving the Problem Chat had 
these double-domes spinning. 

They'd have to work out most 
of the details, naturally, but what 
the hell, that was what subordinates 
were for. He'd need specialists in 
advertising, engineering, communications — did they know anything 
about hypnotism? That might be 
helpful. If not, there'd have to be 
a lot of bribery done, but he'd 
make sure — damned sure — there 
were unlimited funds. 

Just selling building lots to lemmings . . . 

He wished, as he fell asleep, that 
poor Verna could have been in on 
this. It was his biggest, most stu

149 



pendous deal. Verna — that sharp 
shyster Sam Immerman must have 
swindled her . . . 

IT BEGAN the next day with 
people coming to visit him. He 
knew the approach. They merely 
wanted to be helpful to their illustrious visitor from the past and 
would he help fill them in about 
his era, which unfortunately was 
somewhat obscure historically, and 
what did he think could be done 
about .the Problem? He told them 
he was too old to be roped any 
more, and they wouldn't get any 
information out of him until he 
got a letter of intent from at least 
the Polar President, and a session 
of the Polar Congress empowered 
to make him dictator. 

He got the letter and the session. 
He presented his program, was 
asked whether his conscience didn't 
revolt at its callousness, explained 
succinctly that a deal was a deal 
and anybody who wasn't smart 
enough to protect himself didn't 
deserve protection — "Caveat emptor," he threw in for scholarship, 
and had to translate it to "Let the 
buyer beware." He didn't, he stated, 
give a damn about either the morons or their intelligent slaves; he'd 
told them his price and that was 
all he was interested in. 

Would they meet it or wouldn't 
they? 

The Polar President offered to resign in his favor, with certain temporary emergency powers that the 



Polar Congress would vote him if he 
thought them necessary. Barlow demanded the title of World Dictator, complete control of world 
finances, salary to be decided by 
himself, and the publicity campaign 
and historical writeup to begin at 
once. 

"As for the emergency powers," 
he added, "they are neither to be 
temporary nor limited." 

Somebody wanted the floor to 
discuss the matter, with the declared hope that perhaps Barlow 
would modify his demands. 

"You've got the proposition," 
Barlow said. "I'm not knocking off 
even ten per cent." 

"But what if the Congress refuses, sir?" the President asked. 

"Then you can stay up here at 
the Pole and try to work it out 
yourselves. I'll get what I want 
from the morons. A shrewd operator like me doesn't have to compromise; I haven't got a single 
competitor in tliis whole cockeyed 
moronic era." 

Congress waived debate and 
voted by show of hands. Barlow 
won unanimously. 

"You don't know how close you 
came to losing me," he said in his 
first official address to the joint 
Houses. "I'm not the boy to 
haggle; either I get what I ask or 
I go elsewhere. The first thing I 
want is to see designs for a new 
palace for me — nothing wwostentatious, either — and your best painters and sculptors to start working 



150 




 



on my portraits and statues. Meanwhile, I'll get my staff together." 

He dismissed the Polar President 
and the Polar Congress, telling 
them that he'd let them know when 
the next meeting would be. 

A week later, the program 
started with North America the 
first target. 

Mrs. Garvy was resting after 
dinner before the ordeal of turning 
on the dishwasher. The TV, of 
course, was on and it said: "Oooh!" 
— long, shuddery and ecstatic, the 
cue for the Parjum Assault Criminate spot commercial. "Girls," said 
the announcer hoarsely, "do you 
want your man? It's easy to get 
him — easy as a trip to Venus." 

"Huh?" said Mrs. Garvy. 

"Wassamatter?" snorted her husband, starting out of a doze. 

"Ja hear that?" 

"Wha'?" 

"He said 'easy like a trip to 
Venus.' " 
"So?" 

"Well, I thought ya couldn't get 
to Venus. I thought they just had 
that one rocket thing that crashed 
on the Moon." 

"Aah, women don't keep up with 
the news," said Garvy righteously, 
subsiding again. 

"Oh," said his wife uncertainly. 

And the next day, on Henry's 
Other Mistress, there was a new 
character who had just breezed in: 
Buzz Rentshaw, Master Rocket 
Pilot of the Venus run. On Henry's 
Other Mistress, "the broadcast 



drama about you and your neighbors, folksy people, ordinary people, real people"! Mrs. Garvy listened with amazement over a 
cooling cup of coffee as Buzz made 
hay of her hazy convictions. 

MONA: Darling, it's so good 
to see you again! 

BUZZ: You don't know how 
I've missed you on that dreary 
Venus run. 

SOUND: Venetian blind run 
down, key turned in door lock. 

MONA: Was it very dull, dearest? 

BUZZ: Let's not talk about my 
humdrum job, darling. Let's talk 
about us. 

SOUND: Creaking bed. 

Well, the program was back to 
normal at last. That evening Mrs. 
Garvy tried to ask again whether 
her husband was sure about those 
rockets, but he was dozing right 
through Take It and Stick It, so 
she watched the screen and forgot 
the puzzle. 

She was still rocking with 
laughter at the gag line, "Would 
you buy it for a quarter?" when 
the commercial went on for the 
detergent powder she always faithfull}' loaded her dishwasher with 
on the first of every month. 

THE announcer displayed mountains of suds from a tiny piece 
of the stuff and coyly added: "Of 
course, Cleano don't lay around 
for you to pick up like Jhe soap 
root on Venus, but it's pretty cheap 



THE MARCHING MORONS 



151 




152 




 




THE MARCHING MORONS 



and it's almost pretty near just as 
good. So for us plain folks who 
ain't lucky enough to live up there 
on Venus, Cleano is the real cleaning stuff!" 

Then the chorus went into their 
"Cleano-is-the-stuff" jingle, but 
Mrs. Garvy didn't hear it. She was 
a stubborn woman, but it occurred 
to her that she was very sick indeed. She didn't want to worry 
her husband. The next day she 
quietly made an appointment with 
her family freud. 

In the waiting room she picked 
up a fresh new copy of Readers 
Pablum and put it down with a 
faint palpitation. The lead article, 
according to the table of contents 
on the cover, was titled "The Most 
Memorable Venusian I Ever Met." 

"The freud will see you now," 
said the nurse, and Mrs. Garvy 
tottered into his office. 

His traditional glasses and whiskers were reassuring. She choked 
out the ritual: "Freud, forgive me, 
for I have neuroses." 

He chanted the antiphonal: "Tut, 
my dear girl, what seems to be the 
trouble?" 

"I got like a hole in the head," 
she quavered. "I seem to forget all 
kinds of things. Things like everybody seems to know and I don't." 

"Well, that happens to everybody 
occasionally, my dear. I suggest a 
vacation on Venus." 

The freud stared, open-mouthed, 
at the empty chair. His nurse came 
in and demanded, "Hey, you see 

153 



how she scrammed? What was the 
matter with ber?" 

He took off his glasses and whiskers meditatively. "You can search 
me. I told her she should maybe 
try a vacation on Venus." A momentary bafflement came into his 
face and he dug through his desk 
drawers until he found a copy of 
the four-color, profusely illustrated 
journal of his profession. It had 
come that morning and he had lipread it, though looking mostly at 
the pictures. He leafed through to 
the article Advantages of the Planet 
Venus in Rest Cures. 

"It's right there," he said. 

The nurse looked. "It sure is," 
she agreed. "Why shouldn't it be?" 

"The trouble with these here 
neurotics," decided the freud, "is 
that they all the time got to fight 
reality. Show in the next twitch." 

He put on his glasses and whiskers again and forgot Mrs. Garvy 
and her strange behavior. 

"Freud, forgive me, for I have 
neuroses." 

"Tut, my dear girl, what seems 
to be the trouble?" 

LIKE many cures of mental disorders,, Mrs. Garvy's was 
achieved largely by self -treatment. 
She disciplined herself sternly out 
of the crazy notion that there had 
been only one rocket ship and that 
one a failure. She could join without wincing, eventually, in any conversation on the desirability of 
Venus as a place to retire, on its 



fabulous floral profusion. Finally 
she went to Venus. 

All her friends were trying to 
book passage with the Evening Star 
Travel and Real Estate Corporation, 
but naturally the demand was 
crushing. She considered herself 
lucky to get a seat at last for the 
two-week summer cruise. The space 
ship took off from a place called 
Los Alamos, New Mexico. It 
looked just like all the spaceships 
on television and in the picture 
magazines, but was more comfortable than you would expect. 

Mrs. Garvy was delighted with 
the fifty or so fellow-passengers assembled before takeoff. They were 
from all over the country and she 
had a distinct impression that they 
were on the brainy side. The captain, a tall, hawk-faced, impressive 
fellow named Ryan-Something or 
other, welcomed them aboard and 
trusted that their trip would be a 
memorable one. He regretted that 
there would be nothing to see because, "due to the meteorite season," the ports would be dogged 
down. It was disappointing, yet reassuring that the line was taking 
no chances. 

There was the expected momentary discomfort at takeoff and then 
two monotonous days of droning 
travel through space to be whiled 
away in the lounge at cards or 
craps. The landing was a routine 
bump and the voyagers were issued 
tablets to swallow to immunize 
them against any minor ailments. 



154 




 



When the tablets took effect, the 
lock was opened and Venus was 
theirs. 

It looked much like a tropical 
island on Earth, except for a blanket of cloud overhead. But it had 
a heady, other-worldly quality that 
was intoxicating and glamorous. 

The ten days of the vacation 
were suffused with a hazy magic. 
The soap root, as advertised, was 
free and sudsy. The fruits, mostly 
tropical varieties transplanted from 
Earth, were delightful. The simple 
shelters provided by the travel company were more than adequate for 
the balmy days and nights. 

It was with sincere regret that 
the voyagers filed again into the 
ship, and swallowed more tablets 
doled out to counteract and sterilize any Venus illnesses they might 
unwittingly communicate to Earth. 

VACATIONING was one thing. 
Power politics was another. 
At the Pole, a small man was 
in a soundproof room, his face 
deathly pale and his body limp in 
a straight chair. 

In the American Senate Chamber, 
Senator Hull-Mendoza (Synd., N. 
Cal.) was saying: "Mr. President 
and gentlemen, I would be remiss 
in my duty as a legislature if'n I 
didn't bring to the attention of the 
au-gust body I see here a perilous 
situation which is fraught with 
peril. As is well known to members of this au-gust body, the perfection of space flight has brought 



with it a situation I can only describe as fraught with peril. Mr. 
President and gentlemen, now that 
swift American rockets now traverse the trackless void of space 
between this planet and our nearest planetarial neighbor in space — 
and, gentlemen, I refer to Venus, 
the star of dawn, the brightest 
jewel in fair Vulcan's diadome — ■ 
now, I say, I want to inquire what 
steps are being taken to colonize 
Venus with a vanguard of patriotic 
citizens like those minutemen of 
yore. 

"Mr. President and gentlemen! 
There are in this world nations, 
envious nations — I do not name 
Mexico — who by fair means or foul 
may seek to wrest from Columbia's 
grasp the torch of freedom of 
space; nations whose low living 
standards and innate depravity give 
them an unfair advantage over the 
citizens of our fair republic. 

"This is my program: I suggest 
that a city of more than 100,000 
population be selected by lot. The 
citizens of the fortunate city are 
to be awarded choice lands on 
Venus free and clear, to have and 
to hold and convey to their descendants. And the national government shall provide free 
transportation to Venus for these 
citizens. And this program shall 
continue, city by city, until there 
has been deposited on Venus a 
sufficient vanguard of citizens to 
protect our manifest rights in that 
planet. 



THE MARCHING MORONS

"Objections will be raised, for 
carping critics we have always with 
us. They will say there isn't enough 
steel. They will call it a cheap giveaway. I say there is enough steel 
for one city's population to be 
transferred to Venus, and that is 
all that is needed. For when the 
time comes for the second city to 
be transferred, the first, emptied 
city can be wrecked for the needed 
steel! And is it a giveaway? Yes! 
It is the most glorious giveaway 
in the history of mankind! Mr. 
President and gentlemen, there is 
no time to waste — Venus must be 
American!" 

BLACK-KUPPERMAN, at the 
Pole, opened his eyes and said 
feebly, "The style was a little uneven. Do you think anybody'll notice?" 

"You did fine, boy; just fine," 
Barlow reassured him. 

Hull-Mendoza's bill became law. 

Drafting machines at the South 
Pole were busy around the clock 
and the Pittsburgh steel mills 
spewed millions of plates into the 
Los Alamos spaceport of the Evening Star Travel and Real Estate 
Corporation. It was going to be 
Los Angeles, for logistic reasons, 
and the three most accomplished 
psycho-kineticists went to Washington and mingled in the crowd 
at the drawing to make certain 
that the Los Angeles capsule slithered into the fingers of the blindfolded Senator. 



Los Angeles loved the idea and 
a forest of spaceships began to 
blossom in the desert. They weren't 
very good space ships, but they 
didn't have to be. 

A team at the Pole worked at 
Barlow's direction on a mail setup. 
There would have to be letters to 
and from Venus to* keep the slightest taint of suspicion from arising. 
Luckily Barlow remembered that 
the problem had been solved once 
before — by Hitler. Relatives of 
persons incinerated in the furnaces 
of Lublin or Majdanek continued 
to get cheery postal cards. 

THE Los Angeles flight went off 
on schedule, under tremendous 
press, newsreel and television coverage. The world cheered the gallant Angelenos who were setting 
off on their patriotic voyage to the 
land of milk and honey. The forest 
of spaceships thundered up, and 
up, and out of sight without untoward incident. Billions envied the 
Angelenos, cramped and on short 
rations though they were. 

Wreckers from San Francisco, 
whose capsule came up second, 
moved immediately into the city of 
the angels for the scrap steel their 
own flight would require. Senator 
Hull-Mendoza's constituents could 
do no less. 

The president of Mexico, hypnotically alarmed at this extension 
of yanqui imperialismo beyond the 
stratosphere, launched his own 
Venus-colony program.

Across the water it was England 
versus Ireland, France versus Germany, China versus Russia, India 
versus Indonesia. Ancient hatreds 
grew into the flames that were 
rocket ships assailing the air by 
hundreds daily. 

' „ Dear Ed, how are you ? Sam 
and I are fine and hope you 
are fine. Is it nice up there 
like they say with food and 
close grone on trees? I drove 
by Springfield yesterday and it 
sure looked funny all the 
buildings down but of coarse 
it is worth it we have^o keep 
the greasers in their place. Do 
you have any truble with them 
on Venus? Drop me a line 
some time. Your loving sister, Alma. 

Dear Alma, I am fine and hope 
you are fine. It is a fine place 
here fine climate and easy living. The doctor told me today 
that I seem to be ten years 
younger. He thinks there is 
something in the air here 
keeps people young. We do 
not have much trouble with 
the greasers here they keep 
to theirselves it is just a question of us outnumbering them 
and staking out the best places 
for the Americans. In South 
Bay I know a nice little 
island that I have been saving 
for you and Sam with lots of 
blanket trees and ham bushes. 



Hoping to see you and Sam 
soon, your loving brother, Ed. 

Sam and Alma were on their 
way shortly. 

Poprob got a dividend in every 
nation after the emigration had 
passed the halfway mark. The lonesome stay-at-homes were unable to 
bear the melancholy of a low population density; their conditioning 
had been to swarms of their kin. 
After that point it was possible to 
foist off the crudest stripped-down 
accommodations on would-be emigrants; they didn't care. 

Black-Kupperman did a final job 
on President Hull-Mendoza, the 
last job that genius of hypnotics 
would ever do on any moron, important or otherwise. 

Hull-Mendoza, panic-stricken by 
his presidency over an emptying 
nation, joined his constituents. The 
Independence, aboard which traveled the national government of 
America, was the most elaborate of 
all the spaceships — bigger, more 
comfortable, with a lounge that 
was handsome, though cramped, 
and cloakrooms for Senators and 
Representatives. It went, however, 
to the same place as the others and 
Black-Kupperman killed himself, 
leaving a note that stated he 
"couldn't live with my conscience." 

THE day after the American 
President departed, Barlow flew 
into a rage. Across his specially 



THE MARCHING MORONS 



157 



built desk were supposed to flow 
all Poprob high-level documents 
and this - thing — this outrageous 
thing — called Poprob/mw apparently had got into the executive stage 
before he had even had a glimpse 
of it! 

He buzzed for Rogge-Smith, his 
statistician. Rogge-Smith seemed to 
be at the bottom of it. Poprobterm 
seemed to be about first and second 
and third derivatives, whatever 
they were. Barlow had a deep distrust of anything more complex 
than what he called an "average." 

While Rogge-Smith was still at 
the door, Barlow snapped, "What's 
the meaning of this? Why haven't 
I been consulted? How far have 
you people got and why have you 
been working on something I 
haven't authorized?" 

"Didn't want to bother you, 
Chief," said Rogge-Smith. "It was 
really a technical matter, kind of 
a final cleanup. Want to come and 
see the work?" 

Mollified, Barlow followed his 
statistician down the corridor. 

"You still shouldn't have gone 
ahead without my okay," he grumbled. "Where the hell would you 
people have been without me?" 

"That's right, Chief. We couldn't have swung it ourselves; our 
minds just don't work that way. 
And all that stuff you knew from 
Hitler — it wouldn't have occurred 
to us. Like poor Black-Kupperman." 

They were in a fair-sized ma158 



chine shop at the end of a slight 
upward incline. It was cold. RoggeSmith pushed a button that started 
a motor, and a flood of arctic light 
poured in as the roof parted slowly. It showed a small spaceship 
with the door open. 

BARLOW gaped as Rogge-Smith 
took him by the elbow and 
his other boys appeared: SwensonSwenson, the engineer; Tsutsugimushi-Duncan, his propellants 
man; Kalb- French, advertising. 

"In you go, Chief," said Tsutsugimushi-Duncan. "This is Poprobterm." 

"But I'm the world Dictator!" 

"You bet, Chief. You'll be in 
history, all right — but this is necessary, I'm afraid." 

The door was closed. Acceleration slammed Barlow cruelly to the 
metal floor. Something broke and 
warm, wet stuff, salty-tasting, ran 
from his mouth to his chin. Arctic 
sunlight through a port suddenly 
became a fierce lancet stabbing at 
his eyes; he was out of the atmosphere. 

Lying twisted and broken under 
the acceleration, Barlow realized 
that some things had not changed, 
that Jack Ketch was never asked to 
dinner however many shillings you 
paid him to do your dirty work, 
that murder will out, that crime 
pays only temporarily. 

The last thing he learned was 
that death is the end of pain.
