INSIDE EARTH By POUL ANDERSON 

THE biotechnicians had been 
very thorough. I was already a little undersized, 
which meant that my height and 
build were suitable — I could pass 
for a big Earthling. And of course 
my face and hands and so on were 
all right, the Earthlings being a 
remarkably humanoid race. But the 
technicians had had to remodel my 
ears, blunting the tips and grafting 
on lobes and cutting the muscles 
that move them. My crest had to go 
and a scalp covered with revolting 
hair was now on the top of my 
skull. 

Finally, and most difficult, there 
had been the matter of skin color. 
It just wasn't possible to eliminate 
my natural coppery pigmentation. 
So they had injected a substance 
akin to melanin, together with a 
virus which would manufacture it 
in my body, the result being a 
leathery brown. I could pass for a 
member of the so-called "white'* 
subspecies, one who had spent most 
of his life in the open. 

The mimicry was perfect. I 
hardly recognized the creature that 
looked out of the mirror. My lean, 
square, blunt-nosed face, gray eyes, 
and big hands were the same or 
nearly so. But my black crest had 
been replaced with a shock of blond 
hair, my ears were small and immobile, my skin a dull bronze, and 
several of Earth's languages were 
hypnotically implanted in my brain 
— together with a set of habits and 
reflexes making up a pseudo-personality which should be immune to 
any tests that the rebels could think 
of. 

I was Earthling! And the disguise was self-perpetuating: the 
hair grew and the skin color was 
kept permanent by the artificial 
"disease." The biotechnicians had 
told me that if I kept the disguise 
long enough, till I began to age — 



say, in a century or so — the hair 
would actually thin and turn white 
as it did with the natives. 

It was reassuring to think that 
once my job was over, I could be 
restored to normal. It would need 
another series of operations and as 
much time as the original transformation, but it would be as complete and scarless. I'd be human 
again. 

I put on the clothes they had 
furnished me, typical Earthly garments — rough trousers and shirt of 
bleached plant fibers, jacket and 
heavy shoes of animal skin, a battered old hat of matted fur known 
as felt. There were objects in my 
pockets, the usual money and 
papers, a claspknife, the pipe and 
tobacco I had trained myself to 
smoke and even to like. It all fitted 
into my character of a wandering, 
outdoors sort of man, an educated 
atavist. 

I went out of the hospital with 
the long swinging stride of one 
accustomed to walking great distances. 

THE Center was busy around me. 
Behind me, the hospital and 
laboratories occupied a fairly small 
building, some eighty stories of 
stone and steel and plastic. On 
either side loomed the great warehouses, military barracks, officers' 
apartments, civilian concessions, 
filled with the vigorous life of the 
starways. Behind the monstrous 
wall, a mile to my right, was the 



18 




 



spaceport, and I knew that a troopship had just lately dropped gravs 
from Valgolia herself. 

The Center swarmed with young 
recruits off duty, gaping at the 
sights, swaggering in their new 
uniforms. Their skins shone like 
polished copper in the blistering 
sunlight, and their crests were beginning to wilt a little. All Earth 
is not the tropical jungle most Valgolians think it is — northern 
Europe is very pleasant, and Greenland is even a little on the cold 
side — but it gets hot enough at 
North America Center in midsummer to fry a shilast. 

A cosmopolitan throng filled the 
walkways. Soldiers predominated — • 
huge, shy Dacors, little slant-eyed 
Yangtusans, brawling Gorrads, all 
the manhood of Valgolia. Then 
there were other races, blue-skinned 
Vegans, furry Proximans, completely non-humanoid Sirians and Antarians. They were here as traders, 
observers, tourists, whatever else of 
a non-military nature one can 
imagine. 

I made an absent-minded way 
through the crowds. A sudden 
crack on the side of my head, nearly bowling me over, brought me to 
awareness. I looked up into the 
arrogant face of one of the new 
recruits and heard him rasp, 
"Watch where you're going, 
Terrie!" 

The young blood in the Valgolian military is deliberately trained 
to harshness, even brutality, for 



our militarism must impress such 
backward colonies as Earth. It goes 
against our grain, but it is necessary. At another time this might 
have annoyed me. I could have 
pulled rank on him. Not only was 
I an officer, but such treatment 
must be used with intellectual deliberation. The occasional young 
garrison trooper who comes here 
with the idea that the natives are 
an inferior breed to be kicked 
around misses the whole point of 
Empire. If, indeed, Earth's millions 
were an inferior breed, I wouldn't 
have been here at all. Valgol needs 
an economic empire, but if all we 
had in mind was serfdom we'd be 
perfectly content with the plodding 
animal life of Deneb VII or a hundred other worlds. 

I cringed appropriately, as if I 
didn't understand Valgolian Universal, and slunk past him. But it 
griped me to be taken for a Terrie. 
If I was to become an Earthling, 
I would at least be a self-respecting 
one. 

THERE were plenty of Terries — 
Terrestrials — around, of course, 
moving with their odd combination 
of slavish deference toward Valgolians and arrogant superiority 
toward mere Earthlings. They have 
adopted the habits and customs of 
civilization, entered the Imperial 
service, speak Valgolian even with 
their families. Many of them shave 
their heads save for a scalp lock, 
in imitation of the crest, and wear

white robes suggesting those of 
■civil functionaries at home. 

I've always felt a little sorry for 
the class. They work, and study, 
and toady to us, and try so hard 
to be like us. It's frustrating, because that's exactly what we don't 
want. Valgolians are Valgolians 
and Earthlings are men of Earth. 
Well, Terries are important to the 
ultimate aims of the Empire, but 
not in the way they think they are. 
They serve as another symbol of 
Valgolian conquest for Earth to 
hate. 

I entered the Administration 
Building. They expected me there 
and took me at once to the office of 
General Vorka, who's a general 
only as far as this solar system is 
concerned. Had there been any 
Earthlings around, I would have 
saluted to conform to the show of 
militarism, but General Vorka sat 
alone behind his desk, and I merely said, "Hello, Coordinator." 

The sleeves of his tunic rolled 
up, the heat of North America 
beading his forehead with sweat, 
the big man looked up at me. "Ah, 
yes. I'm glad you're finally prepared. The sooner we get this thing 
started — " He extended a silver 
galla-dust box. "Sniff? Have a seat, 
Conru." 

I inhaled gratefully and relaxed. 
The Coordinator picked up a sheaf 
of papers on his desk and leafed 
through them. "Umm-mm, only 
fifty-two years old and a captain 
already. Remarkably able, a young 




20 




 



if 



man like you. And your work 
hitherto has been outstanding. That 
Vegan business . . ." 

I said yes, I knew, but could he 
please get down to business. You 
couldn't blame me for being a bit 
anxious to begin. Disguised as I 
was as an Earthman, I felt uncomfortable, embarrassed, almost, at 
being with my ex-countrymen. 

The Coordinator shrugged. 
"Well, if you can carry this business off — fine. If you fail, you may 
die quite unpleasantly. That's their 
trouble, Conru: you wouldn't be 
regarded as an individual, but as 
a Valgolian. Did you know that 
they even make such distinctions 
among themselves? I mean races 



ana sub-races and social castes and 
the like; it's keeping them divided 
and impotent, Conru. It's also keeping them out of the Empire. A 
shame." 

I KNEW all that, of course, but 
I merely nodded. Coordinator 
Vorka was a wonderful man in his 
field, and if he tended to be on 
the garrulous side, what could I 
do? I said, "I know that, sir. I also 
know I was picked for a dangerous 
job because you thought I could 
fill the role. But I still don't know 
exactly what the job is." 

Coordinator Vorka smiled. "I'm 
afraid I can't tell you much more 
than you must already have 



INSIDE EARTH

guessed," he said. "The anarch 
movement here — the rebels, that 
is — is getting no place, primarily 
because of internal difficulties. 
When members of the same group 
spit epithets at each other referring to what they consider racial 
or national distinctions which determine superiority or inferiority, 
the group is bound to be an insecure one. Such insecurity just does 
not make for a strong rebellion, 
Conru. They try, and we goad 
them — but dissention splits them 
constantly and their revolutions 
fizzle out. 

"They just can't unite against 
us, can't unite at all. Conru, you 
know how we've tried to educate 
them. It's worked, too, to some 
extent. But you can't educate three 
billion people who have a whole 
cultural pattern behind them." 

I winced. "Three billion?" 

"Certainly. Earth is a rich planet, 
Conru, and a fairly crowded one 
at the same time. Bickering is inevitable. It's a part of their culture, 
as much as cooperation has been 
a part of ours." 

I nodded. "We learned the hard 
way. The old Valgol was a poor 
planet and we had to unite to conquer space or we could not have 
survived." 

The Coordinator sniffed again 
at his silver box. "Of course. And 
we're trying to help these people 
unite. They don't have to make the 
same mistakes we did, long ago. 
They don't have to at all. Get them 



to hate us enough, get them to 
hate us until all their own clannish 
hatreds don't count at all . . . Well, 
you know what happened on Samtrak." 

I knew. The Samtraks are now 
the entrepreneurs of the Empire, 
really ingenious traders, but within 
the memory of some of our older 
men they were a sore-spot. They 
didn't understand the meaning of 
Empire any more than Earth does, 
and they never did understand it 
until we goaded- them into open 
rebellion. The very reverse of divide and rule, you might say, and 
it worked. We withdrew trading 
privileges one by one, until they 
revolted successfully, thus educating themselves sociologically in only 
a few generations. 

VORKA said, "The problem of 
Earth is not quite that 
simple." He leaned back, made a 
bridge of his fingers, and peered 
across them at me. "Do you know 
precisely what a provocateur job is, 
Conru?" 

I said that I did, but only in a 
hazy way, because until now my 
work had been pretty much restricted to social relations on the more 
advanced Empire planets. However, 
I told him that I did know the idea 
was to provoke discontent and, 
ultimately, rebellion. 

The Coordinator smiled. "Well, 
that's just the starter, Conru. It's a 
lot more complex than that. Each 
planet has its own special problems. 



22 




 



The Samtraks, for example, had a 
whole background of cutthroat competition. That was easy: we eliminated that by showing them what 
real cutthroat competition could be 
like. But Earth is different. Look at 
it this way. They fight among 
themselves. Because of their mythical distinctions, not realizing that 
there are no inferior races, only 
more or less advanced ones, and 
that individuals must be judged as 
individuals, not as members of 
groups, nations or races. A planet 
like Earth can be immensely valuable to the Empire, but not if it 
has to be garrisoned. Its contribution must be voluntary and wholehearted." 

"A difficult problem," I said. 
"My opinion is that we should treat 
all exactly alike — force them to 
abandon their unrealistic differences." 

"Exactly!" The Coordinator 
seemed pleased, but, actually, this 
was pretty elementary stuff. "We're 
never too rough on the eager lads 
who come here from Valgol and 
kick the natives around a bit. We 
even encourage it when the spirit 
of rebelliousness dies down." 

I told him I had met one. 

"Irritating, wasn't it, Conru? 
Humiliating. Of course, these lads 
will be reconditioned to civilization when they finish their military 
service and prepare for more specialized work. Yes, treating all 
Earthlings alike is the solution. We 
put restrictions on these colonials; 



they can't hold top jobs, and so 
on. And we encourage wild storie. 
about brutality on our part. No: 
enough to make everybody mad a: 
us, or even a majority — the rumored tyranny has always happened 
to someone else. But there's a certain class of beings who'll get fighting mad, and that's the class we 
want." 

"The leaders," I chimed in. 
"The idealists. Brave, intelligent 
patriotic. The kind who probably 
wouldn't be a part of this racial 
bickering, anyway." 

"Right," said the Coordinator. 
"We'll give them the ammunition 
"for their propaganda. We've been 
doing it. Result: the leaders get 
mad. Races, religions, nationalities, 
they hate us worse than they hate 
each other." 

THE way he painted it, I was 
hardly needed at all. I told 
him that. " 

"Ideally, that would be the situation, Conru. Only it doesn't 
work that way." He took out a 
soft cloth and wiped his forehead. 
"Even the leaders are too involved 
in this myth of differences and 
they can't concentrate all their 
efforts. Luron, of course, would be 
the other alternative — " 

That was a very logical statement, but sometimes logic has a 
way of making you laugh, and I 
was laughing now. Luron considered itself our arch-enemy. With a 
few dozen allies on a path of con


INSIDE EARTH 



23 



quest, Luron thought it could wrest 
Empire from our hands. Well, we 
let them play. And each time Luron 
swooped down on one of the more 
primitive planets, we let them, for 
Luron would serve as well as ourselves in goading backward peoples 
to unite and advance. Perhaps 
Luron, as a social entity, grew wiser 
each time. Certainly the primitive 
colonials did. Luron had started a 
chain reaction which threatened to 
overthrow the tyranny of superstition on a hundred planets. Good 
old Luron, our arch-enemy, would 
see the light itself some day. 

The Coordinator shook his head. 
"Can't use Luron here. Technologies are entirely too similar. It 
might shatter both planets, and we 
wouldn't want that." 

"So what do we use?" 

"You, Conru. You get in with 
the revolutionaries, you make sure 
that they want to fight, you — " 

"I see," I told him. "Then I try 
to stop it at the last minute. Not 
so soon that the rebellion doesn't 
help at all — " 

The Coordinator put his hand 
down flat. "Nothing of the sort. 
They must fight. And they must 
be defeated, again and again, if 
necessary, until they are ready to 
succeed. That will be, of course, 
when they are totally against us." 

I stood up. "I understand." 

He waved me back into the chair. 
"You'll be lucky to understand it 
by the time you're finished with 
this assignment and transferred to 



another . . . that is, if you come 
out of this one alive." 

I smiled a bit sheepishly and 
told him to go ahead. 

"We have some influence in the 
underground movement, as you 
might logically expect. The leader 
is a man we worked very hard to 
have elected." 

"A member of one of the despised races?" I guessed. 

"The best we could do at this 
point was to help elect someone 
from a minority sub-group of the 
dominant white race. The leader's 
name is Levinsohn. He is of the 
white sub-group known as Jews." 

"TTOW well is this Levinsohn 
-L.-L accepted by the movement?" 

"Considerable resistance and 
hostility," the Coordinator said. 
"That's to be expected. However, 
we've made sure that there is no 
other organization the minorityhaters can join, so they have to 
follow him or quit. He's able, all 
right; one of the most able men 
they have, which helps our aims. 
Even those who discriminate 
against Jews reluctantly admire 
him. He's moved the headquarters 
of the movement out into space, 
and the man's so brilliant that we 
don't even know where. We'll find 
out, mainly through you, I hope, 
but that isn't the important thing." 

"What is?" I asked, baffled. 

"To report on the unification of 
Earth. It's possible that the anarch 



24 




 



movement can achieve it under Levinsohn. In that case, we'll make 
sure they win, or think they win, 
and will gladly sign a treaty giving 
Earth equal planetary status in the 
Empire." 

"And if unity hasn't been 
achieved?" 

"We simply crush this rebellion 
and make them start all over again. 
They'll have learned some degree 
of unity from this revolt and so 
the next one will be more successful." He stood up and I got out 
of my chair to face him. "That's 
for the future, though. We'll work 
out our plans from the results of 
this campaign." 

"But isn't there a lot of danger 
in the policy of fomenting rebellion against us?" I asked. 

He lifted his shoulders. "Evolution is always painful, forced evolution even more so. Yes, there are 
great dangers, but advance information from you and other agents can 
reduce the risk. It's a chance we 
must take, Conru." 

"Conrad," I corrected him, smiling. "Plain Mr. Conrad Haugen 
. . . of Earth." 

II 

A FEW days later, I left North 
America Center, and in spite 
of the ominous need to hurry, my 
eastward journey was a ramble. The 
anarchs would be sure to check my 
movements as far back as they 
could, and my story had better ring 



true. For the present, I must be my 
role, a vagabond. 

The city was soon behind me. It 
was far from other settlement — it 
is good policy to keep the Centers 
rather isolated, and we could always contact our garrisons in native 
towns quickly enough. Before long 
I was alone in the mountains. 

I liked that part of the trip. The 
Rockies are huge and serene, a 
fresh cold wind blows from their 
peaks and roars in the pines, brawling rivers foam through their dales 
and canyons — it is a big landscape, 
clean and strong and lonely. It 
speaks with silence. 

I hitched a ride for some hundreds of miles with one of the great 
truck-trains that dominate the western highways. The driver was Earthling, and though he complained 
much about the Valgolian tyranny 
he looked well-fed, healthy, secure. 
I thought of the wars which had 
been laying the planet waste, the 
social ruin and economic collapse 
which the Empire had mended, and 
wondered if Terra would ever be 
fit to "rule itself. 

I came out of the enormous 
mountainlands into the sage plains 
of Nevada. For a few days I worked 
at a native ranch, listening to the 
talk and keeping my mouth shut. 
Yes, there was discontent ! 
. "Their taxes are killing me," said 
the owner. "What the hell incentive 
do I have to produce if they take 
it away from me?" I nodded, but 
thought: Your kind was paying 



INSIDE EARTH 



25 



more taxes in the old days, and had 
less to show for it. Here you get 
your money back in public works 
and universal security. No one on 
Earth is cold or hungry. Can you 
only produce for your own private 
gain, Earthling? 

"The labor draft got my kid the 
other day," said the foreman. 
"He'll spend two good years of his 
life working for them, and prob'ly 
come back hopheaded about the 
good o' the Empire." 

There was a time, I thought, 
when millions of Earthlings clamored for work, or spent years fighting their wars, gave their youth to 
i god of battle who only clamored 
for more blood. And how can we 
have a stable society without educating its members to respect it? 

"I want another kid," said the female cook. "Two ain't really 
enough. They're good boys, but I 
want a girl too. Only the Eridanian 
law says if I go over my quota, if 
I have one more, they'll sterilize 
me ! And they'd do it, the meddling 
devils." 

A billion Earthlings are all the 
Solar System can hold under decent standards of living without 
exhausting what natural resources 
their own culture left us, I thought. 
W e aren't ready to permit emigration; our own people must come 
first. But these beings can live ivell 
here. Only now that we've eliminated famine, plague, and war, they'd 
breed beyond reason, breed till all 
the old evils came back to throttle 



them, if we didn't have strict population control. 

"T7-EAH," said her husband 
-L bitterly. "They never even 
let my cousin have kids. Sterilized 
him damn near right after he was 
born." 

Then he's a moron, or carries 
hemophilia, or has some other 
hereditary taint, I thought. Can't 
they see we're doing it for their 
own good? It costs us fantastically 
in money and trouble, but the goal 
is a level of health and sanity such 
as this race never in its history 
dreamed possible. 

"They're stranglin' faith," muttered someone else. 

Anyone in the Empire may worship as he chooses, but should permission be granted to preach 
demonstrable falsehoods, archaic 
superstitions, or antisocial nonsense? The old "free" Earth was 
not noted for liberalism. 

"We want to be free." 

Free? Free for what? To loose 
the thousand Earthly races and 
creeds and nationalisms on each 
other — and on the Galaxy — to wallow in barbarism and slaughter 
and misery as before we came? To 
let our works and culture be 
thrown in the dust, the labor of a 
century be demolished, not because 
it is good or bad but simply because it is Valgolian? Epsilon Eridanian! 

"We'll be free. Not too long to 
wait, either — " 



26 




 



That's up to nobody else but 
you! 

I couldn't get much specific information, but then I hadn't expected to. I collected my pay and 
drifted on eastward, talking to people of all classes — farmers, mechanics, shopowners, tramps, and such 
data as I gathered tallied with 
those of Intelligence. 

About twenty-five per cent ojf 
the population, in North America 
at least — it was higher in the Orient 
and Africa — was satisfied with the 
Imperium, felt they were better off 
than they would have been in the 
old days. "The Eridanians are 
pretty decent, on the whole. Some 
of 'em come in here and act nice 
and human as you please." 

Some fifty per cent was vaguely 
dissatisfied, wanted "freedom" 
without troubling to define the 
term, didn't like the taxes or the 
labor draft or the enforced disarmament or the legal and social superiority of Valgolians or some such 
thing, had perhaps suffered in the 
reconquest. But this group constituted no real threat. It would tend 
to be passive whatever happened. 
Its greatest contribution would be 
sporadic rioting. 

The remaining twenty-five per 
cent was bitter, waiting its chance, 
muttering of a day of revenge — 
and some portion of this segment 
was spreading propaganda, secretly 
manufacturing and distributing 
weapons, engaging in clandestine 
military drill, and maintaining con


tact with the shadowy Legion of 
Freedom. 

Childish, melodramatic name ! 
But it had been well chosen to appeal to a certain type of mind. The 
real, organized core of the anarch 
movement was highly efficient. In 
those months I spent wandering 
and waiting, its activities mounted 
almost daily. 

THE illegal radio carried unending programs, propaganda, 
fabricated stories of Valgolian brutality. I knew from personal experience that some were false, and 
I knew the whole Imperial system 
well enough to spot most of the 
rest at least partly invented. I realized we couldn't trace such a wellorganized setup of mobile and coordinated units, and jamming 
would have been poor tactics, but 
even so — • 

The day is coming . . . Earthmen, free men, be ready to throw 
off your shackles . . . Stand by for 
freedom! 

I stuck to my role. When autumn came, I drifted into one of 
the native cities, New Chicago, a 
warren of buildings near the remains of the old settlement, the 
same gigantic slum that its predecessor had been. I got a room in a 
cheap hotel and a job in a steel 
mill. 

I was Conrad Haugen, Norwegian-American, assigned to a spaceship by the labor draft and liking 
it well enough to re-enlist when 



INSIDE EARTH 



27 



my term was up. I had wandered 
through much of the Empire and 
had had a great deal of contact 
with Eridanians, but was most 
emphatically not a Terrie. In fact, 
I thought it would be well if the 
redskin yoke could be thrown off, 
both because of liberty and the 
good pickings to be had in the 
Galaxy if the Empire should collapse. I had risen to second mate 
on an interstellar tramp, but could 
get no further because of the law 
that the two highest officers must 
be Valgolian. That had embittered 
me and I returned to Earth, footloose and looking for trouble. 

I FOUND it. With officer's training and the strength due to a 
home planet with a gravity half 
again that of Earth, I had no difficulty at all becoming a foreman. 
There was a big fellow named 
Mike Riley who thought he was 
entitled to the job. We settled it 
behind a shed, with the workmen 
looking on, and I beat him unconscious as fast as possible. The raw, 
sweating savagery of it made me 
feel ill inside. They'd let this loose 
among the stars! 

After that I was one of the boys 
and Riley was my best friend. We 
went out together, wenching and 
drinking, raising hell in the cold 
dirty canyons of steel and stone 
which the natives called streets. 
Valgolia, Valgolia, the clean bare 
windswept heights of your mountains, soughing trees and thunder


ous waters and Maara waiting for 
me to come home.' Riley often proposed that we find an Eridanian 
and beat him to death, and I would 
agree, hiccupping, because I knew 
they didn't go alone into native 
quarters any more. I sat in the 
smoky reek of the bars, half deafened by the clatter and raucousness 
called music, trying not to think 
of a certain low-ceilinged, quiet 
tavern amid the gardens of Kalariho, and sobbed the bitterness of 
Conrad Haugen into my beer. 

"Dirty redskins," I muttered. 
"Dirty, stinking, bald-headed, sons 
of bitches. Them and their goddamn Empire. Why, y'know, if 't 
hadn' been f their laws I'd be 
skipper o' my own ship now. I 
knew more'n that slob o' a captain. 
But he was born Eridanian — God, 
to get my hands on his throat!" 

Riley nodded. Through the haze 
of smoke I saw that his eyes were 
narrowed. He wasn't drunk when 
he didn't want to be, and at times 
like this he was suddenly as sober 
as I was, and that in spite of not 
having a Valgolian liver. 

I bided my time, not too obviously anxious to contact the 
Legion. I just thought they were 
swell fellows, the only brave men 
left in the rotten, stinking Empire; 
I'd sure be on their side when the 
day came. I worked in the mill, 
and when out with the boys lamented the fact that we were really 
producing for the damned Eridanians, we couldn't even keep the 



28 




 



INSIDE EARTH 29 



products of our own sweat. I wasn't 
obtrusive about it, of course. Most 
of the time we were just boozing. 
But when the talk came to the Empire, I made it clear just where I 
stood. 

THE winter went. I continued 
the dreary round of days, wondering how long it would take, 
wondering how much time was left. 
If the Legion was at all interested, 
they would be checking my background right now. Let them. There 
wouldn't be much to check, but 
what there was had been carefully 
manufactured by the experts of the 
Intelligence Service. 

Riley came into my room one 
evening. His face was tight, and 
he plunged to business. "Con, do 
you really mean all you've said 
about the Empire?" 

"Why, of course. I — " I glanced 
out the window, as if expecting to 
see a spy. If there were any, I knew 
he would be native. The Empire 
just doesn't have enough men for 
a secret police, even if we wanted 
to indulge in that sort of historically ineffective control. 

"You'd like to fight them? Like 
really to help the Legion of Freedom when they strike?" 

"You bet your obscenity life!" I 
snarled. "When they land on Earth, 
I'll get a gun somewhere and be 
right there in the middle of the 
battle with them!" 

"Yeah." Riley puffed a cigaret 
for a while. Then he said, "Look, 



I can't tell you much. I'm taking a 
chance just telling you this. It could 
mean my life if you passed it on 
to the Eridanians." 
"I won't." 

His eyes were bleak. "You 9amn 
well better not. If you're caught at 
that — " 

He drew a finger sharply across 
his throat. 

"Quit talking like a B-class 
stereo," I bristled. "If you've got 
something to tell me, let's have it. 
Otherwise get out." 

"Yeah, sure. We checked up on 
you, Con, and we think you're as 
good a prospect as we ever came 
across. If you want to fight the Eridanians now — join the Legion now 
— here's your chance." 

"My God, you know I do! But 
who — " 

"I can't tell you a thing. But if 
you really want to join, memorize 
this." Riley gave me a small card on 
which was written a name and address. "Destroy it, thoroughly. Then 
quit at the mill and drift to this 
other place, as if you'd gotten tired 
of your work and wanted to hit the 
road again. Take your time, don't 
make a beeline for it. When you do 
arrive, they'll take care of you." 

I nodded, grimly. "I'll do it, 
Mike. And thanks!" 

"Just my job." He smiled, relaxing, and pulled a flask from his 
overcoat. "Okay, Con, that's that. 
We'd better not go out to drink, 
after this, but nothing's to stop us 
from getting stinko here."

Ill 

SPRING had come and almost 
gone when I wandered into the 
little Maine town which was my 
destination. It lay out of the way, 
with forested hills behind it and the 
sea at its foot. Most of the houses 
were old, solidly built, almost like 
parts of the land, and the inhabitants were slow-spoken, steady folk, 
fishermen and artisans and the like, 
settled here and at home with the 
darkling woods and the restless sea 
and the high windy sky. I walked 
down a narrow street with a cool 
salt bree2e ruffling my hair and 
decided that I liked Portsboro. It 
reminded me of my own home, 
twenty light-years away on the wide 
beaches of Kealvigh. 

I made my way to Nat Hawkins' 
store and asked for work like any 
drifter. But when we were alone in 
the back room, I told him, "I'm 
Conrad Haugen. Mike Riley said 
you'd be looking for me." 

He nodded calmly. "I've been 
expecting you. You can work here a 
few days, sleep at my house, and 
we'll run the tests after dark." 

He was old for an Earthling, well 
over sixty, with white hair and lined 
leathery face. But his blue eyes were 
as keen and steady, his gnarled 
hands as strong and sure as those 
of any young man. He spoke softly 
and steadily, around the pipe which 
rarely left his mouth, and there was 
a serenity in him which I could 
hardly associate with anarch fanati


cism. But the first night he led me 
into his cellar, and through a wellhidden trapdoor to a room below, 
and there he had a complete psychological laboratory. 

I gaped at the gleaming apparatus. "How off Earth — " 

"It came piece by piece, much of 
it from Epsilon Eridani itself," he 
smiled. "There is, after all, no ban 
on humans owning such material. 
But to play safe, we spread the 
purchases over several years, and 
made them in the names of many 
people." 

"But you — " 

"I took a degree in psychiatry 
once. I can handle this." 

He could. He put me through the 
mill in the next few nights — intelligence tests, psychometry, encephalography, narcosis, psycho-probing, 
everything his machines and his' 
skill could cover. He did not find 
out anything we hadn't meant to be 
found out. The Service had ways of 
guarding its agents with counterblocks. But he got a very thorough 
picture of Conrad Haugen. 

In the end he said, still calmly, 
"This is amazing. You have an IQ 
well over the borderline of genius, 
an astonishing variety of assorted 
knowledge about the Empire and 
about technical subjects, and an implacable hatred of Eridanian rule — ■ 
based on personal pique and containing self-seeking elements, but 
no less firm for that. You're out for 
yourself, but you'll stand by your 
comrades and your cause. We'd 



INSIDE EARTH 



31 



never hoped for more recruits of 
your caliber." 

"When do I start?" I asked impatiently. 

"Easy, easy," he smiled. "There's 
time. We've waited fifty years; we 
can wait a while longer." He riffled 
through the dossier. "Actually, the 
difficulty is where to assign you. A 
man who knows astrogation, the use 
of weapons and machines, and the 
Empire, who is physically strong as 
a bull, can lead men, and has a 
dozen other accomplishments, really 
seems wasted on any single job. I'm 
not sure, but I think you'll do best 
as a roving agent, operating between Main Base and the planets 
where we have cells, and helping 
with the work at the base when 
you're there." 

MY HEART fairly leaped into 
my throat. This was more 
than / had dared hope for! 

"I think," said Nat Hawkins, 
"you'd better just drop out of sight 
now. Go to Hood Island and stay 
there till the spaceship comes next 
time. You can spend the interval 
profitably, resting and getting a 
little fattened up; you look half 
starved. And Barbara can tell you 
about the Legion." His leather face 
smiled itself into a mesh of fine 
wrinkles. "I think you deserve that, 
Conrad. And so does Barbara." 

Mentally, I shrugged. My stay in 
New Chicago had pretty well convinced me that all Earthling females 
were sluts. And what of it? 



The following night, Hawkins 
and I rowed out to Hood Island. It 
lay about a mile offshore, a wooded, 
rocky piece of land on which a 
moon-whitened surf boomed and 
rattled. The place had belonged to 
the Hood family since the first settlements here, but Barbara was the 
last of them. 

Hawkins' voice came softly to me 
above the crash of surf, the surge of 
waves and windy roar of trees as we 
neared the dock. "She has more 
reason than most to hate the Eridanians. The Hoods used to be great 
people around here. They were just 
about ruined when the redskins first 
came a-conquering, space bombardment wiped out their holdings, but 
they made a new start. Then her 
grandfather and all his brothers 
were killed in the revolt. Ten years 
ago, her father was caught while 
trying to hijack a jetload of guns, 
and her mother didn't live long 
after that. Then her brother was 
drafted into a road crew and reported killed in an accident. Since 
then she hasn't lived for much except the Legion." 

"I don't blame her," I said. My 
voice was a little tight, for indeed I 
didn't. But somebody has to suffer; 
civilization has a heavy price. I 
couldn't help adding, "But the Empire's lately begun paying pensions 
to cases like that." 

"I know. She draws hers, too, 
and uses it for the Legion." 

Thai, of course, was the reason 
for the pensions. 



32 




 



The boat bumped against the 
dock. Hawkins threw the painter up 
to the man who suddenly emerged 
from the shadow. I saw the cold 
silver moonlight gleam off the rifle 
in his hand. "You know me, Eb," 
said Hawkins. "This here's Con 
Haugen. I slipped you the word 
about him." 

"Glad to know you, Con." Eb's 
horny palm clasped mine. I liked his 
looks, as I did those of most of the 
higher-up Legionnaires. They were 
altogether different from the lowcaste barbarians who were all the 
rebels I'd seen before. They had a 
great load of ignorance to drag with 
them. 

We went up a garden path to a 
rambling stone house. Inside, it was 
long and low and filled with the 
memoirs of more gracious days, art 
and fine furniture, books lining the 
walls, a fire crackling ruddily in the 
living room. 

"Barbara Hood — Conrad Haugen." 

ALMOST, I gaped at her. I had 
expected some gaunt, dowdy 
fanatic, a little mad perhaps. But 
she was — well, she was tall and 
supple and clad in a long dark -blue 
evening gown that shimmered 
against her white skin. She was not 
conventionally pretty, her face was 
too strong for all of its fine lines, 
but she had huge blue eyes and a 
wide soft mouth and a stubborn 
chin. The light glowed gold on the 
hair that tumbled to her shoulders. 



I blurted something out and she 
smiled, with a curious little twist 
that somehow caught in me, and 
said merely, "Hello, Conrad." 

"Glad to be here," I mumbled. 

"The spaceship should arrive in a 
month or so," she went on. "I'll 
teach you as much as I can in that 
time. And you'd better get your own 
special knowledge onto a record 
wire, just in case. I understand 
you've been in the Vegan System, 
for instance, which nobody else in 
the Legion knows very much about." 

Her tone was cool and businesslike, but with an underlying warmth. 
It was like the sea wind which blew 
over the islands, and as reviving. I 
recovered myself and helped mix 
some drinks. The rest of the evening passed very pleasantly. 

Later a servant showed me to my 
room, a big one overlooking the 
water. I lay for a while listening to 
the waves, thinking drowsily how 
rebellion, when its motives were 
honest, drew in the best natives of 
any world, and presently I fell 
asleep. 

The month passed all too quickly 
and agreeably. I learned things 
which Intelligence had spent the 
last three years trying to find out, 
and dared not attempt to transmit 
the information. That was maddening, though I knew there was time. 
But otherwise — 

I puttered about the place. There 
were only three servants, old family 
retainers who had also joined the 
anarchs. They had little modern 



INSIDE EARTH 



33 



machinery, and of course Earthlings 
weren't allowed robots, so there was 
need for an extra man or two. I cut 
wood and repaired the roof and 
painted the boathouse, spaded the 
garden and cleared out brush and 
set up a new picket fence. It was 
good to use my hands and muscles 
again. 

And then Barbara was around to 
help with most of what I did. In 
jeans and jersey, the sun ablaze on 
her hair, laughing at my clumsy 
jokes or frowning over some tough 
bit of work, she was another being 
than the cool, lovely woman who 
talked books and music and history 
with me in the evenings, or the 
crisp bitter anarch who spat facts 
and figures at me like an angry 
machine. And yet they were all her. 
I remembered Ydis, who was dead, 
and the old pain stirred again. But 
Barbara was alive. 

She was more alive to me than 
most of Valgolia. 

I make no apologies for my feelings. I had been away from anything resembling home for some 
two years now. But I was careful to 
remain merely friendly with Barbara. 

SHE didn't know a great deal 
about the rebel movement — no 
one agent on Earth did — but her 
knowledge was still considerable. 
There was a fortified base somewhere out in space, built up over a 
period of four years with the help 
of certain unnamed elements or 




planets outside the Empire. I suspected several rival states of that ! 

Weapons of all kinds were manufactured there in quantities sufficient 
to arm the million or so rebels of 
the "regular" force, the twenty million or so in the Solar System and 
elsewhere who held secret drills and 
conducted terrorist activities, and 
the many millions more who were 
expected to rise spontaneously when 
the rebel fleet struck. 

There was close coordination and 
a central command at Main Base for 
the undergrounds of all dissatisfied 
planets — a new and formidable feature which had not been present in 
the earlier uprisings. There were 
rumors of a new and terrible 
weapon being developed. 

In any case, the plan was to assault Epsilon Eridani itself simultaneously with the uprisings in the 
colonies, so that the Imperial fleet 
would be recalled to defend the 
mother world. The anarchs hoped 
to blast Valgolia to ruin in a few 
swift blows, and expected that the 



34 




 



Empire's jealous neighbors would 
sweep in to complete the wreckage. 

This gentle girl spoke of the 
smashing of worlds, the blasting of 
helpless humans, and the destruction of a culture as if it were a 
matter of insect extermination. 

"Have you ever thought," I asked 
casually once, "that the Juranians 
and the Slighs and our other hypothetical allies may not respect the 
integrity of Sol any more than the 
Eridanians do?" 

"We can handle them," she answered confidently. "Oh, it won't 
be easy, that time of transition. But 
we'll be free." 

"And what then?" I went on. "I 
don't want to be defeatist, Barbara, 
but you know as well as I do that 
the Eridanians didn't conquer all 
mankind at a -single swoop. When 
they invented the interstellar engine 
and arrived here, man was tearing 
the Solar System apart in a war between super-nations that was rapidly 
reducing him to barbarism. The redskins traded for a while, sold arms, 
some of their adventurers took sides 
in the conflict, the government 
stepped in to protect Eridanian citizens and investments — the side 
which the Eridanians helped won 
the war, then found its allies were 
running things and tried to revolt 
against the protectorate — and without really meaning to, the strangers 
were conquering and ruling Earth. 

"But the different factions of man 
still hate each other's guts. There 
are still capitalists and communists, 



blacks, whites and Browns, Hindus 
and Moslems, Germans and Frenchmen, city people and country people 
— a million petty divisions. There'll 
be civil war as soon as the Eridanians are gone." 

"Some, perhaps," she agreed. 
"But I think it can be handled. If 
we have to have civil wars, well, 
let's get them over with and live as 
free men." 

Personally, I could see nothing 
in the sort of military dictatorship 
that would inevitably arise which 
was preferable to an alien, firm, but 
just rule that insured stability and a 
reasonable degree of individual liberty. 

But I didn't say that aloud. 

ANOTHER time we talked of 
the de-industrialization of 
Earth. Barbara was, of course, venomous about it. "We were rich 
once," she said. "All Earth was. We 
have one of the richest planets in 
the Galaxy. But because their own 
world is poor, the redskins have to 
take the natural resources of their 
conquests. Earth is a granary and a 
lumberyard for Valgolia, and the 
iron of Mars and the petrolite of 
Venus go back to their industry. 
What few factories they allow us, 
they take their fat percentage of 
the product." 

"Certainly they've made us economically dependent," I said, "and 
their standard of living is undoubtedly higher than ours. But ours has, 
on the whole, gone up since the 



36 




 



conquest. We eat better, we're 
healthier, we aren't burdened with 
the cost of past and present and future wars. Our natural resources 
aren't being squandered. The forests 
and watersheds and farmlands we 
ruined are coming back under Eridanian supervision." 

She gave me an odd look. "I 
thought you didn't like the Empire." 

"I don't," I growled. "I don't 
want to be held back just because 
I'm white-skinned. But I've known 
enough reddies personally so that I 
try to be fair." 

"It's all right with me," she said. 
"I can see your point, intellectually, 
though I can't really jeel it. But not 
many of the people will out at 
Main Base." 

"Free men," I muttered sardonically. 

We went fishing, and swam in 
the tumbling surf, and stretched 
lazily on the beach with the sun 
pouring over us. Or we might go 
tramping off into the woods on a 
picnic, to run laughing back when a 
sudden rain rushed out of the sky, 
and afterward sit with beer and 
cheese sandwiches listening to a 
wire of Beethoven or Mozart or 
Tschaikowsky — the old Earthlings 
could write music, if they did nothing else! — and to the rain shouting 
on the roof. We might have a little 
highly illegal target practice, or a 
game of chess, or long conversations 
which wandered off every which 
way. I began to have a sneaking 



hope fhat the spaceship would be 
delayed. 

We went out one day in Barbara's 
little catboat. The waves danced 
around us, chuckling against the 
hull, glittering with sunlight, and 
the sail was like a snow mountain 
against the sky. For a while we 
chatted dreamily, ate our lunch, 
threw the scraps to the hovering 
gulls. Then Barbara fell silent. 

"What's the matter?" I asked. 

"Oh, nothing. Touch of W ellscbmerz, maybe." She smiled at me. 
"You know, Con, you don't really 
belong in the Legion." 

"How so?" I raised my eyebrows. 

"You — well, you're so darned 
honest, so really decent under that 
carefully rough surface, so — reasonable. You'll never make a good 
fanatic." 

Honest! I looked away from her. 
The bright day seemed suddenly to 
darken. 

IV 

SPACESHIPS from Main Base 
had little trouble coming to 
Earth with their cargoes of guns, 
propaganda, instructors, and whatever else the rebels on the planet 
needed. They would take up an orbit just beyond the atmosphere and 
send boats to the surface after dark. 
There was little danger of their 
being detected if they took the usual 
precautions; a world is simply loo 
big to blockade completely. 

Ours dropped on noiseless grav


INSIDE EARTH 



37 



itic beams into the nigh ted island 
woods. We had been watching for 
it the last few days, and now Eb 
came running to tell us it was here. 
The pilot followed after him. 

"Harry Kane, Conrad Haugen," 
Barbara introduced us. 

I shook hands, sizing him up. He 
was tall for an Earthling, almost as 
big as I, dark-haired, with goodlooking young features. He wore 
some approximation of a uniform, 
dark-blue tunic and breeches, peaked 
cap, captain's insignia, which gave 
him a rather dashing look. It 
shouldn't have made any difference 
to me, of course, but I didn't like 
the way he smiled at Barbara. 

She explained my presence, and 
he nodded eagerly. "Glad to have 
you, Haugen. We need good men, 
and badly." Then to her: "Get 
Hawkins. You and he are recalled 
to Main Base." 

"What? But—" 

A dark exultation lit his face. 
"The time for action is near — very 
near! We're pulling all our best 
agents off the planets. They can 
work more effectively with the fleet 
now." 

I tried to look as savagely gleeful 
as they, but inwardly I groaned. 
How in all the hells was I going to 
contact Vorka? If I were stranded 
out in space when the fleet got 
under way — no, they must have an 
ultrabeam. I'd manage somehow to 
call on that even if they caught me 
at it. 

We sent Eb in a boat to get 



Hawkins while Barbara and I 
packed a few necessities. Kane 
paced back and forth, spilling out 
the news from Main Base, word of 
mighty forces gathering, rumors of 
help promised from outside, it was 
like the thunder which mutters just 
before a gale. 

Presently Hawkins arrived. The 
old man's calm was undisturbed: he 
puffed his pipe and said quietly, "I 
called up my housekeeper, told her 
my sister in California was suddenly taken sick and I was leaving 
at once for the transcontinental jetport. Just to account for disappearing, you know. There aren't any 
Eridanians or Terries hereabouts, 
but we desperate characters — " he 
grinned, briefly — "can't be too careful. Brought my equipment along, 
of course. I suppose they want me 
to do psychometry on fleet personnel?" " 

"Something on that order. I don't 
know." 

We made our way through a fine 
drizzle of rain to the little torpedo 
of the spaceboat. I looked around 
into the misty dark and breathed a 
deep lungful of the cool wet wind. 
And I saw that Barbara was doing 
the same. 

SHE smiled up at me through the 
night and the thin sad rain. 
"Earth is a beautiful world, Con," 
she whispered. "I wonder if we'll 
ever see it again." 

I squeezed her hand, silently, and 
we crowded into the boat. 



38 




 



Kane made a smooth takeoff. In 
minutes we were beyond the atmosphere, Earth was a great glowing shield of cloudy blue behind us, 
and the stars were bitter bright 
against darkness. We sent a coded 
call signal and got a directional 
beam from the ship. Before long we 
were approaching it. 

I studied the lean black cruiser. 
She seemed to be of about the same 
design as the old Solarian interplanetary ships, modified somewhat 
to accommodate the star drive. Apparently, she was one of those built 
at Main Base. Her bow guns were 
dark shadows against the clotted 
cold silver of the Milky Way. I 
thought of the death and the ruin 
which could flame from them, I 
thought of the hell she and her 
kind bore — atomic bombs, radiodust 
bombs, chemical bombs, disease 
bombs, gravity snatchers, needle 
beams, disintegrative shells, darkness and doom and the new barbarism — and felt a stiffening within 
me. Fostering this murderousness 
was a frightful risk. The main defense against it was Intelligence, 
and that depended on agents like 
myself. Perhaps only myself. 

The crew was rather small, no 
battles being anticipated. But they 
were well disciplined, uniformed 
and trained, a new Solarian army 
built up from the fragments of the 
old. The captain was a stiff gray 
German who had been a leader in 
the earlier revolt and since fled to 
space, but most of the officers, such 



as Kane, were young and violent in 
their eagerness. 

We orbited around the planet for 
another day or so till all the boats 
had returned. There was tension in 
the ship — if the Imperial navy 
should happen to spot us, we were 
done. Off duty, we would sit around 
talking, smoking, playing games 
with little concentration. 

Kane spent most of his free hours 
with Barbara. They had much to 
talk about. I swallowed a certain irrational jealousy and wandered 
around cautiously pumping as many 
men as I could. 

We got under way at last. By this 
time I had learned that Main Base 
was a planet, but no more. Only the 
highest leadership of the Legion 
knew its location, and they were 
pledged to swallow the poison they 
always carried if there seemed to be 
any danger of capture. 

For several days by the clocks we 
ran outward, roughly toward Draco. 
Our velocity was not revealed, and 
the slow shift in the outside view 
didn't help much. I guess that we 
had come perhaps ten parsecs, but 
that was only a guess. 

"Approaching Main Base. Stand 
by." 

WHEN the call rang hollowly 
down the ship's passageways, 
I could feel the weariness and tautness easing, I could see homecoming 
in the faces around me. I stole a 
glance at Barbara. Her eyes were 
wide and litr lips parted, she looked 



INSIDE EARTH 



39 



ahead as if to stare through the 
metal walls. She had never been 
here either, here where all her 
dreams came home. 

So we landed, we slipped down 
out of the dark and the cold and the 
void, and I heard the rattle and 
groan of metal easing into place. 
When the ship's interior grav-ficld 
was turned off, I felt a sudden 
heaviness; this world had almost a 
quarter again the pull of Earth. But 
people got used to that quickly 
enough. It was the landscape which 
was hard to bear. 

They had told us that even 
though Boreas had a breathable atmosphere and a temperature not always fatally low, it was a bleak 
place. But to one who had never 
been far from the lovely lands of 
Earth, its impact was like a blow in 
the face. Barbara shuddered close 
to me as we came out of the airlock, 
and I put an arm about her waist, 
knowing the sudden feeling of loneliness which rose in her. 

SAVE for the spaceport and other 
installations, Main Base was 
underground. There was no city to 
relieve the grimness of the scene. 
We were in a narrow valley between 
sheer, ragged cliffs that soared crazily into a murky sky. The sun was 
low, a smouldering disc of dull red 
like curdling blood; its sullen light 
glimmered on the undying snow 
and ice and seemed only to make 
the land darker. Stars glittered here 
and there in the dusky heavens, 



hard and bright and cruel, almost, 
as in space. 

Dark sky, dark land, dark world, 
with the sheer terrible mountains 
climbing gauntly for the upper 
gloom, crags and glaciers like fangs 
against the dizzy cliffs, with the 
great shadows marching across the 
bloody snow toward us, with a 
crazed wind muttering and whining 
and chewing at our flesh. It was 
cold. The cold was like a knife. 
Pain stung with every breath and 
eyes watered with tears that froze 
on suddenly numb cheeks. A great 
shudder ripped through us and we 
ran toward the entrance to the city. 
The snow crunched dry and old 
under our boots, the cold ate up 
through the soles, and the wind 
whistled its scorn. 

Even when an elevator had 
taken us a mile down into the 
warmth and light of the base, we 
could not forget. It was a city for 
a million men and other beings 
and more than a few women and 
children, a city of long streets and 
small neat apartments, hydroponic 
farms and food synthesizers, 
schools, shops and amusement 
places, factories, military barracks 
and arsenals, even an occasional 
little flower garden. Its people 
could live here almost indefinitely, 
working and waiting for their day 
of rising. 

There was little formality in the 
civilian areas. Everyone who had 
come this far was trusted. A man 
came up to us new arrivals from 



40 




 



Earth, asked about conditions there, 
and then said he would show us 
to our quarters. Later we would be 
told to whom we should report for 
duty. 

"Let's go, then, Con," said Barbara, and slipped a cool little hand 
into mine. I could not refrain from 
casting a smug backward glance at 
the somewhat chapfallen Kane. 

V 

WE SLIPPED quickly into the 
the routine of the place. It 
was a taut-nerved, hard-working 
daily round. I could feel the savage expectancy building up like a 
physical force, but intelligent life 
is adaptable and we got used to it. 
There was work to do. 

Hawkins was second in command 
of the psychological service, testing and screening and treating personnel, working on training and 
indoctrination, and with a voice in 
the general staff where problems of 
unit coordination and psychological 
warfare were concerned. Barbara 
worked under him, secretary and 
records keeper and general troubleshooter. Those were high posts, but 
both were allowed to retain the 
nominally civilian status which they 
preferred. 

Their influence and my own test 
scores got me appointed assistant 
supervisor of the shipyards. That 
suited me very well — I was reasonably free from direct orders and 
discipline, with authority to come 



and go pretty much as I pleased. 
They kept me busy; sometimes I 
worked the clock around, and I did 
my best to further production of 
the weapons which might destroy 
my planet. For whatever I did 
would make little difference at this 
late date. 

A good deal of my time also 
went to drill with the armed forces 
of which, like every able-bodied 
younger man, I was a reserve member. They put me in an engineer 
unit and I soon had command of 
it. I did my best here too, whipping my grim young charges into a 
sapper group comparable to the 
Empire's, for I had to be above all 
suspicion, even of incompetence. 

We worked at our learning. We 
went topside and shivered and 
manned our guns, set our mines 
and threw up our bridges, in the 
racking cold of Boreas. Over ancient snow and ice we trotted, lost 
in the jumbled wilderness of cruel 
peaks and railing wind, peeling the 
skin from our fingers when we 
touched metal, camped under 
scornful stars and a lash of drifting 
ice-dust — but we learned! 

My own, more private education 
went on apace. I found where we 
were. It was a forgotten red dwarf 
star out near the shadowy border 
of the Empire, listed in the catalogues as having one Class III 
planet of no interest or value. That 
was a good choice; no spaceship 
would ever happen into this system 
by accident or exploration. The an

archs had built their hopes on the 
one lonely planet, and had named 
it Boreas after the god of the north 
wind in one of their mythologies. 
My company called it less complimentary things. 

The base, including the attached 
city, was under military command 
which ultimately led up to the general staff of the Legion. This was 
a council of officers from half a 
score of rebellious planets, though 
Earthlings predominated and, of 
course, Simon Levinsohn held the 
supreme authority. I met him a few 
times, a gaunt, lonely man, enormously able, ridden by his cause as 
by a nightmare, but not unkindly 
on a personal level. With just that 
indomitable heart, the Maccabees 
had faced Rome's iron legions — 
Valgolia was greatly interested in 
the ancient history of a conquered 
province, knowing how often it 
held the key to current problems. 

There was also a liaison officer 
from Luron sitting at staff meetings. 
Luron ! 

WHEN I first saw him, this 
Colonel Wergil, I stood stiff 
and cold and felt the bristling along 
my spine. He looked as humanoid 
as most of the races at the base. 
Hairless, faintly scaled greenishyellow skin, six fingers to a hand, 
and flat chinless face don't make 
that breed hideous to me; I have 
reckoned Ganolons and Mergri 
among my friends. But Luron — 
the old and deadly rival, the lesser 



empire watching its chance to 
pounce on us, hating us for the 
check we are on the ambitions of 
their militarists. Luron. 

I have no race prejudices and 
am willing to take the word of our 
comparative psychologists that there 
is no more inherent evil in the 
Luronians than in any other stock, 
that the peculiar cold viciousness 
of their civilization is a matter of 
unfortunate cultural rather than 
biological evolution and could be 
changed in time. But none of this 
alters the fact that at present they 
are what they are, brilliant, greedy, 
heartless, and a menace to the peace 
of the Galaxy. I have been too long 
engaged in the struggle between 
my nation and theirs to think 
otherwise. 

Other states had sent some clandestine help to the Legion, weapons 
and money and vague promises. 
Luron, I soon found, had said it 
would attack us in full strength if 
the uprising showed a good chance 
of success, and meanwhileithey gave 
assistance, credits and materiel and 
the still more important machine 
tools, and Wergil's military advice 
was useful, 

I know now, as I suspected even 
then, that Levinsohn and his associates were not fooled as to Luron's 
ultimate intentions. Indeed, they 
planned to make common cause 
with what remained of Valgolia, as 
well as certain other traditional 
foes of their present ally, as soon 
as they had gained their objectives 



42 




 



of independence, and stop any 
threat of aggression from Luron. 
It was shrewdly planned, but such 
a shaky coalition, still bleeding 
with the hurts and hatreds of a 
struggle just ended, would be 
weaker than the Empire, and Luron 
almost certainly would have sowed 
further dissension in it and waited 
for its decay before striking. 

The Earthlings have a proverb 
to the effect that he who sups with 
the Devil must use a long spoon. 
But they seemed to have forgotten 
it now. 

The attack, I learned, was scheduled for about four months from 
the time the agents were recalled. 
The rebels were counting on the 
Valgolian power being spread too 
thinly over the Empire to stand off 
their massed assault on a few key 
points. Then, with the home planet 
a radioactive ruin, with revolt in a 
score of planetary systems and the 
ensuing chaos and communications 
breakdown, and with the Luronians 
invading, the Imperial fleet and 
military would have to make terms 
with the anarchs. 

IT WOULD work. I knew with 
a dark chill that it would work. 
Unless somehow I could get a warning out. That had to be done for 
more than the protection of Epsilon 
Eridani, which, even in a surprise 
attack could defend itself better 
than these conspirators realized. But 
all bloodshed should be spared, if 
possible — and the rebellion did not 



yet deserve to succeed, for the unity 
achieved thus far had been the unity 
of a snake pit against a temporary 
enemy. 

Did it all rest on me? God of 
space, had the whole burden of history suddenly fallen on my shoulders ? 

1 didn't dare think about it. I 
forced the consequences of failure 
out of my forebrain, back down 
into the unconscious, the breeding 
ground of nightmares, and lived 
from one day to the next. I worked, 
and waited, learned what I could 
and watched for my chance. 

But it was not all grimness and 
concentration. It couldn't be; intelligent life just isn't built that 
way. We had our social activities, 
small gatherings or big parties, we 
relaxed and played. At first 1 found 
that gratifying, for it gave me a 
chance to pump the others. Then I 
found it maddening, because it kept 
me from snooping and laying plans. 
Finally it began to hurt — I was 
coming to know the anarchs. 

They lived and laughed and 
loved even as humans do. They 
were basically as decent and reasonable as any similar group of Valgolians. Many were as tormented 
as I by the thought of the slaughter 
they readied. There were embittered 
ones, who had lost all they held 
dear, and I realized that, while 
civilization has its price, you can't 
be objective about it when you are 
the one who must pay. There were 
others who had been well off and 



INSIDE EARTH 



43 



had chucked all their hopes to join 
a desperate cause in which they 
happened to believe. There were 
children — and what had they done 
to deserve having their parents 
gambling away life? 

In spite of their appearance, to 
which I was now accustomed, they 
were human. When I had laughed 
and talked and sung and drunk 
beer and danced and arranged entertainments with them, they were 
my friends. 

Moodily, I began to see that I 
would be one of the price-payers. 

I saw most of Hawkins and Barbara, and after them — because of 
her — Kane. The old psychologist 
and I got along famously. He would 
drop into my room for a smoke and 
a cup of coffee and a drawled conversation whenever he had the 
chance. His slow gentle voice, his 
trenchancy, the way the little crinkles appeared around his eyes when 
he smiled, reminded me of my 
father. I often wish those two 
could have met. They would have 
enjoyed each other. 

Then Barbara would stop by on 
her way from work, or, better yet, 
she would ask me over to her apartment for a home-cooked dinner. 
Yes, she could cook too. We would 
sometimes take long walks down 
the corridors of the city, we even 
went up once in a while to the 
surface for a breath of cold air and 
loneliness, and it was the most 
natural thing in the world for us 
to go hand in hand. 



There was no sunlight underground. But when the fluorotube 
glow shone on her hair, I thought 
of sunlight on Earth, the high keen 
light of the Colorado plateaus, the 
morning light stealing through the 
trees of Hood Island. 

Ydis, Ydis, I said, once your violet eyes were like the skies over 
Kalariho, over Kealvigh, our borne, 
pasture land of winds. But it has 
been so long. It has beet; ten years 
since you died — 

I fought. May all the gods bear 
witness that I fought myself. And 
I thought I was winning. 

VI 

I WILL never forget one certain 
evening. 

Hawkins and I had come over to 
Barbara's for supper, and the three 
of us were sitting now, talking. 
Wier.iawski's Violin Concerto cried 
its sorrow, muted in the background, and the serene home she 
had made of the bare little functional apartment folded itself 
around us. Then Kane dropped in 
as he often did, with a casualness 
that fooled nobody, and sat with 
all his soul in his eyes, looking at 
Barbara. He was a nice kid. I didn't 
know why he should annoy me so. 

The talk shifted to Valgolia. I 
found myself taking the side of my 
race. It wasn't that I hoped to convert anyone, but — well, it was 
wrong that we should be monsters 
in the sight of these friends. 



44 




 



"Brutes," said Kane. "Twolegged animals. Damned bald-headed, copper-skinned giants. Wouldn't be quite so bad if they were 
octopi or insects, but they're just 
enough different from us to be a 
caricature. It's obscene." 

"Sartons look like a dirty joke 
on mankind," I said. "Why don't 
you object to them?" 

"They're in the same boat as us." 

"Then why mix political and 
esthetic prejudices? And have you 
ever thought that you look just as 
funny to an Eridanian?" 

"No race should look odd to 
another," said Nat Hawkins. He 
puffed blue clouds. "Even by our 
standards, the redskins are handsome, in a more spectacular way 
than humans, maybe." 

"And Barbara," I smiled, with 
a curious little pang inside me, 
"would look good to any humanoid." 

"I should think so," said Kane 
sulkily. "The redskins took enough 
of our women." 

"Well," I said, "their original 
conquistadores were young and 
healthy, very far from home, and 
had just finished a hard campaign 
where they lost many friends. At 
least there were no half-breeds 
afterward. And since the reconquest 
none of their soldiers has been permitted to have anything to do with 
an Earthwoman against her consent. It's not their fault if the 
consent is forthcoming oftener than 
you idealists think." 



"That sort of thing was more or 
less standard procedure at home 
with them, wasn't it?" asked 
Hawkins. 

I NODDED. "The harshness of 
their native world forced them 
to develop their technology faster 
than on Earth, so they kept a lot 
of barbarian customs well into the 
industrial age. For instance, the 
rulers of the state that finally con-, 
quered all the others and unified 
the planet took the title Waehing, 
Emperor, and it's still a monarchy 
in theory. But a limited monarchy 
these days, with parliamentary democracy and even local self-government of the town-meeting sort. 
They're highly civilized now." 

"I wouldn't call that spree of 
conquest they went on exactly civilized." 

"Well, just for argument's sake, 
let's try to look at it from their 
side," I answered. "Here their explorers arrived at Sol, found a system richer than they could well 
imagine — and all the wealth being 
burned up in fratricidal war. Their 
technical power was sufficiently beyond ours so that any band of adventurers could do pretty much as 
it wanted in the Solar System, and 
all native states were begging for 
their help. It was inevitable that 
they'd mix in. 

"Sure, the Eridanians have been 
exploiting Solarian resources, 
though perhaps more wisely than 
we did. Sure, they garrison un


INSIDE EARTH 



45 



willing planets. But from their 
point of view, they're slowly civilizing a race of atomic-powered 
savages, and taking no more than 
their just reward for it. Sure, 
they've done hideous things, or 
were supposed to have, but there' ve 
been plenty of reforms in their 
policy since our last revolt. They've 
adopted the — the red man's burden." 

"Could be. But Sol wasn't their 
only conquest." 

"Oh, well, of course they had 
their time of all-out imperialism. 
There are still plenty of the old 
school around, starward the course 
of empire, keep the lesser breeds 
in their place, and so on. That's 
one reason why the highest posts 
are still reserved for members of 
their own race, another being that 
even the liberal ones don't trust us 
that far, yet. 

"Their first fifty years or so saw 
plenty of aggression. But then they 
stabilized. They had as much as 
they could manage. To put it baldly, the Empire is glutted. And now, 
without actually admitting they ever 
did wrong, they're trying to make 
up what they did to many of their 
victims." 

"They could do that easily 
enough. Just let us go free." 

<<T'VE already told you why they 
-L don't dare. Apart from fearing us, they're economically and 
militarily dependent on their colonies. You're an American, Nat. 



Why didn't our nation let the South 
go its own way when it wanted to 
secede? Why don't we all go back 
to Europe and let the Indians have 
our country? 

"And, of course, Epsilon Eridani honestly thinks it has a great 
civilizing mission, and is much 
better for the natives than any lesser 
independence could ever be. In 
some cases, you've got to admit 
they're right. Have you ever seen 
a real simon-pure native king in 
action? Or read the history of nations like Germany and Russia? 
And why do we have to segregate 
races and minorities even in our 
own organization to prevent 
clashes?" 

"We're getting there," said Nat 
Hawkins. "It's not easy, but we'll 
make it." 

Only you're not there yet, I 
thought, and for that reason you 
must be stopped. 

"You claim they're sated," said 
Barbara. "But they've kept on conquering here and there, to this very 
day." 

"Believe it or not, but with rare 
exceptions that's been done reluctantly. Peripheral systems have 
learned how to build star ships, 
become nuisances or outright menaces, and the Empire has had to 
swallow them. Modern technology 
is simply too deadly for anarchy. 
A full-scale war can sterilize whole 
planets. That's another function of 
empire, so the Eridanians claim — 
just to keep civilization going till 



46 




 



something better can be worked 
out." 

"Such as what?" 

"Well, several worlds already 
have donagangor status — self-government under the Emperor, representatives in the Imperial Council, 
and no restrictions on personal advancement of their citizens. Virtual 
equality with the Valgolians. And 
their policy is to grant such status 
to any colony they think is ready 
for it." 

Hawkins shook his head. "Won't 
do, Con. It sounds nice, but old 
Tom Jefferson had the right idea. 
'If men must wait in slavery until 
they are ready for freedom, they 
will wait long indeed.' " 

"Who said we were slaves — " I 
began. 

"You talk like a damned reddie. 
yourself," said Kane. "You seem 
to think pretty highly of the Empire." 

I GAVE him a cold look. "What 
do you think I'm doing here?" 
I snapped. 

"Yeah. Yeah, sorry. I'm kind of 
tired. Maybe I'd better go now." 
Before long Kane made some 
rather moody good nights and went 
out. 

Nat Hawkins twinkled at me. 
"I'm a little bushed myself," he 
said. "Guess I'll hit the bunk too." 

When he was gone, I sat smoking and trying to gather up the 
will to leave. There was a darkness in me. What, after all, was 



I doing here? Gods, I believed I 
was in the right, but why is right 
so pitiless? 

On Earth they represent the goddess of justice as blind. On Valgolia she has fangs. 

Barbara came over and sat on 
the arm of my chair. "What's the 
matter, Con?" she asked. "You 
look pretty grim these days." 

"My work's developing some 
complications," I said tonelessly. 
My mind added : It sure is. No way 
to call headquarters, the rebellion 
gathering enormous momentum, 
and on a basis of treachery and racial hatred. 

Barbara's fingers rumpled my 
hair, the grafted hair which by 
now felt more a part of me than 
my own lost crest. "You're an odd 
fellow," she said quietly. "On the 
surface so frank and friendly and 
cheerful, and down underneath 
you're hiding yourself and your 
private unhappiness." 

"Why," I looked up at her, astonished, "even the psychologists — " 

"They're limited, Con. They can 
measure, but they can't feel. Not 
the way — " 

She stopped, and the light 
glowed in her hair and her eyes 
were wide and serious on mine and 
one small hand stole over to touch 
my fingers. Blindly, I wrenched 
my face away. 

Her voice was low. "It's some 
other woman, isn't it?" 

"Other — ? Well, no. There was 



INSIDE EARTH 



47 



one, but she's dead now. She died 
ten years ago." 

Ydis, Ydis! 

"Your wife?" 

I nodded. "We were only 
married for three years. My daughter is still alive; she's going on 
twelve now. But I haven't seen her 
for over two years. She's not on 
Earth. I wonder if she even thinks 
of me." 

"Con," said Barbara, very softly 
and gravely, "you can't go on 
mourning a woman forever." 

"I'm not. Forget it. I shouldn't 
have spoken about it." 

"You needed to. That's all 
right." 

"My girl ought to have a 
mother — " The words came of 
themselves. What followed thereafter seemed also to happen without my willing it. 

Presently Barbara stood back 
from me. She was laughing, low 
and sweet and joyous. "Con, you 
old sourpuss, cheer up! It isn't that 
bad, you know!" 

I managed a wry grin, though it 
seemed to need all the energies left 
in me. "You look so happy your 
fool self that I have to counterbalance it." 

"Con, if you knew how I'd been 
hoping!" 

We talked for a long time, but 
she did most of it — the plans, the 
hopes, the trip we were going to 
take and the house we were going 
to build down by the seashore — 
"Mary," my daughter, was going 



to have a home, along with the 
dozen brothers and sisters she'd 
have in due course — after the war. 
After the war. 

I left, finally, stumbling like a 
blind man toward my quarters. Oh, 
yes, I loved her and she loved me 
and we were going to have a home 
and a sailboat and a dozen children, after the w r ar, when Earth 
was free. What more could a man 
ask for? 

It had been many years since I'd 
needed autohypnosis to put myself 
to sleep, but I used it now. 

VII 

A MONTH passed. 
The delay was partly due 
to the slowness with which I had 
\o work, even after a plan had been 
laid. I could only do a little at a 
time, and the times had to be well 
separated. Each day brought the moment' of onslaught closer, but I 
dared not hurry myself. If they 
caught me at my work, there would 
be an end of all things. 

But I cannot swear that my own 
mind did not prompt me to an unnatural slowness and caution. I was 
only human, and every day was 
one more memory. 

They had all been very good to 
us; our friends had a party to celebrate our engagement and we were 
universally congratulated and all 
the rest of it. Yes, Kane was there 
too, shaking my hand and wishing 
me all the luck in the world. After

ward he went back to his work and 
his pilot's practice with a strange 
fierceness. 

If at times I fell into glum abstraction, well, I had always been 
a little moody and Barbara could 
tease me out of it. Most of the 
times I was with her, I didn't think 
about the future at all. 

There had been a certain deep 
inward coldness to her. She had 
carried the old wound of her losses 
with bitter dignity. But as the days 
went on, I saw less and less of it. 
She would even admit that individual Valgolians might be fine fellows and that the Empire had done 
a few constructive things for Earth. 
But it was more than a change of 
attitude. She was thawing after a 
long winter, she laughed more, she 
was wholly human now. 

Human — 

We sat one evening, she and I, in 
one of the big lounges the base had 
for its personnel. There were only 
one or two muted lights in the long 
quiet room, a breathing of music, 
snatches of whispering like our 
own. She sat close against me, and 
my lips kept straying down to brush 
her hair and her cheek. 

"When we're married — " she 
said dreamily. Then all at once: 
"Con, what are we waiting for?" 

I LOOKED at her in some surprise. 

"Con, why do we assume we can't 
get married before the war's over?" 
Her voice was low and hurried, 



shaking just a little. "The base here 
has chaplains. It's less than a month 
now till the business starts. God 
knows what'll happen then. Either 
of us might be killed." I heard her 
gulp. "Con, if they killed you — " 

"They won't," I said. "I'm killproof." 

"No, no. We have so little time, 
and it may be all we'll ever have. 
Marry me now, darling, dearest, 
and at least there'll be something to 
remember. Whatever comes, we'll 
have had that while." 

"I tell you," I insisted, with a 
sudden hideous dismay, "there's 
nothing to worry about. Forget it." 

"Oh, I'm not asking for pity. I've 
more happiness now than is right. 
Maybe that's why I'm afraid. But, 
Con, they killed my father and they 
killed my mother and they killed 
Jimmy, and if they take you too, it'll 
be more than I can stand." 

The savage woe of an old Earthly 
poet lanced through my brain: 

The time is out of joint 
O cursed spite, 
That ever I was bom 
To set it right! 

And then, for just a moment, 
there came the notion of yielding. 
You love the girl, Conru. You love 
her so much it's a pain in you. Well, 
take her! Marry her! 

No. I was not excessively tender 
of heart or conscience, but neither 
was I that kind of scoundrel. 

I kissed her words away. After


INSIDE EARTH 



49 



ward, alone in the darkness of my 
room, I realized that Conrad Haugen had no good reason to hang 
back. It was true, all she said was 
true, and no other couple was wait 
ing for an uncertain future. 
It was the time for action. 

I HAD been ready for days now, 
postponing the moment. And 
those days were marching to the 
time of war, the rebels were quivering to go, a scant few weeks at most 
lay between me and the ruin of 
Valgolian plans and work and hope. 

In my steadily expanding official 
capacity, I could go anywhere and 
do almost anything in an engineering line. So, bit by bit, I had tinkered with the base's general alarm 
system. 

We had scoutships posted, of 
course, but by the very nature of 
things they had to be close to the 
planet or an approaching enemy 
would slip between them without 
detection. And the substantial vibrations of a ship traveling faster than 
light do not arrive much ahead of 
the ship itself. Whatever warning 
we had of a hypothetical assault 
would be very short. It would be 
signaled to all of us by a siren on 
the intercommunications system, 
and after that it would be battle stations, naval units to their ships and 
all others to such ground defenses 
as we had. 

But modern warfare is all to the 
offense. There is no way of stopping 
an attack from space except by meet


ing it and annihilating it before it 
gets to its destination. The rebels 
were counting on that fact to aid 
them when they struck, but it 
would, of course, work against them 
if their enemy should happen to hit 
first. Everyone was understandably 
nervous about the chance of our 
being discovered and assailed. 

Working a little at a time, I had 
put a special switch in the general 
alarm circuit. It showed up merely 
as one of many on a sector call 
board near my room; no one was 
likely to notice it. And my quarters 
were not those originally given me. 
I had moved to a smaller place farther from Barbara, ostensibly to be 
near my work at the shipyards, actually to be near the base's ultrabeam 
shack. 

Now it was time to act. 

I needed an excuse for not going 
to the gun turret where I was assigned. That involved faking a serious fever, but like all Intelligence 
men, I had been trained to full psychosomatic integration. The same 
neural forces that in hysteria produce paralysis, stigmata, and other 
real symptoms were under my conscious control. I thought myself 
sick. By morning I was half delirious and my veins were on fire. 

The surgeon general came to see 
me. "What the hell's the trouble?" 
he wondered. "This place is supposed to be sterile." 

"Maybe it's too damn sterile," I 
murmured with a perfectly genuine 
weakness. Then, fighting the light

headedness that hummed and buzzed 
in me: "Tsitbn fever, Doc. I'm sure 
that's what it is." 

"Can't say I've ever heard of it." 

"You'll find it in your medical 
books." He would, too. "It's found 
on the planet Sirius V, where I once 
visited. Filter-passing virus, transmitted by airborne spores. Not contagious here. In humans it becomes 
chronic; no ill effects except a few 
days' fever like this every few years. 
Now go 'way and lemme die in 
peace." I closed my eyes on the distorted and unreal world of sickness. 

LATER Barbara came in, pale 
and with her hair like a rumpled halo. I had to assure her many 
times that I was all right and would 
be on my feet in two or three days. 
Then she smiled and sat down on 
the bunk and passed a cool palm 
over my forehead. 

"Poor Con," she said. "Poor 
squarehead." 

"I feel fine as long as you're 
here," I whispered. 

"Don't talk," she said. "Just go 
to sleep." She kissed me and sat 
quiet. Hers was the rare gift of 
being a definite personality even 
when silent and motionless. I 
clasped her hand and pretended to 
fall into uneasy sleep. After a while 
she kissed me again, very softly, and 
went out. 

I told my body to recover. It took 
time, hours of time, while the stub 
born cells retreated to a normal 
level of activity. I lay there thinking 



of many things, most of them unpleasant. 

It was well into the night, the 
logical time to act even if the factories did go on a twenty-four hour 
basis. 

I got up, still swaying a little 
with weakness, the dregs of the 
fever ringing in my head. After I 
had vomited and swallowed a stimulant tablet, I felt better. I put on my 
uniform, but substituted a plain 
service jacket without insignia of 
rank for the tunic. That should 
make me fairTy inconspicuous in the 
confusion. . 

Strength came. I glanced cautiously along the dim-lit corridor, 
and it was empty and silent. I stole 
out and hurried toward the ultrabeam shack. My hidden switch was 
on the way; I threw it and ran on 
with lowered head. 

The siren screamed behind me, 
before me, around me, the howling 
of all the devils in hell — Hoo! 
boo! Batlle stations! Strange ships 
approaching! Batlle stations! All 
hands to battle stations! Hoo-oo! 

I could imagine the pandemonium that erupted, men boiling out 
of factories and rooms, cursing and 
yelling and dashing frantically for 
their posts — children screaming in 
terror, women white-faced with sudden numbness — weapons manned, 
instruments sweeping the skies, 
spaceships roaring heavenward, incoherent yelling on the intercoms to 
find out who had given that signal. 
With luck, I would have fifteen 



INSIDE EARTH

minutes or half an hour of safe insanity. 

A few men raced by me, on their 
way to the nearest missile rack. They 
paid me no heed, and I hurried 
along my own path. 

The winding stair leading up to 
the ultrabeam shack loomed before 
me. I went its length, three steps at 
a time, bounding and gasping with 
my haste, up to the transmitter. 

It was the tenuous link binding 
together a score of rebel planets, the 
only communication with the stars 
that glittered so coldly overhead. 
The ultrabeam does not have an infinite velocity, but it does have an 
unlimited speed, one depending 
solely on the frequency of the generating equipment, and since it only 
goes to such receivers as are tuned 
to its pattern — there must be at least 
one such tuned unit for the generator to work — it has a virtually 
infinite range. So men can talk between the stars, but are their words 
the wiser for that? 

UP AND up and up, round and 
round, up and up, metal clanging underfoot and always the demon screech of the siren — up ! 

I sprang from the head of the 
stairs and crossed the areaway in one 
leap to the open door of the shack. 
There was only one operator on 
duty, a slim boyish figure before the 
glittering panel. He didn't hear me 
as I came behind him. I knocked 
him out with a calculated blow to 
the base of the skull. He'd be un


conscious for at least fifteen minutes and that was time enough. I 
heaved his body out of the chair 
and sat down. 

The unit was set for the complicated secret scrambler pattern of the 
Legion, one which was changed 
periodically just in case. I twirled 
the dials, adjusting for the pattern 
of the set I knew was kept tuned for 
me at Vorka's headquarters. 

The set hummed, warming up. I 
lifted my eyes and stared into the 
naked face of Boreas. The shack 
was above ground, itself dominated 
by the skeletal tower of the transmitter, and a broad port revealed 
land and sky. 

Overhead the stars were glittering, bright and hard and cruel, 
flashing and flashing out of the crystal dark. The peaks rose on every 
side, soaring di2ziness of cliffs and 
ragged snarl of crags, hemming us 
in with our tiny works and struggles. It was bitterly, ringingly cold 
out there; the snow screamed when 
you walked on it; the snapping 
thunder of frost-split rock woke the 
dull roar of avalanches, and there 
was the wind, the old immortal 
wind, moaning and blowing and 
wandering under the stars. I saw 
them running, little antlike men 
spilling from their nest and racing 
across the snow before they froze. I 
saw the ships rise one after the 
other and rush darkly skyward. The 
base had come alive and was reaching up to defy the haughty stars. 

The set buzzed and whistled, 



52 




 



warming up, muttering with the 
cosmic interference whose source 
nobody knows. I began to speak into 
the microphone, softly and urgently: 
"Calling Intelligence HQ, Sol HI, 
North America Center. Captain 
Halgan Conru calling North America Center. Come in, enter, come 
in." 

THE receiver rustled -with the 
thin dry voice of the stars. 
Dimly, I could hear the wind outside, snarling around the walls. 

"Come in, Center. Come in, Center." 

"Captain Halgan!" The voice 
rattled into the waiting stillness of 
the shack. "Captain Halgan, is it 
really you?" 

"Get General Vorka at once," I 
said. "Meanwhile, are you recording? All right, be sure you get 
this." 

I told them everything I knew. 
I told them what planet this was, 
and where we were on its surface, 
and what our strength and plans 
were. I gave them the disposition 
of the scoutship pickets, as far as 
those were known to me, and the 
standard Legion recognition signals. 
I finished with an account of the 
savage differences still existing between Earthman and Earthman, and 
Earth and its treacherous allies. And 
all the time I was talking to a recording machine. Nobody was 
listening. 

When I was through, I waited a minute, not feeling any par


ticular emotion. I was too tired. I 
sat there, listening to the wind and 
the interstellar whistling, till Vorka 
spoke to me. 

"Halgan! Halgan, you've done 
it!" 

"Shut up," I said. "What's coming now?" 

"I checked the Fleet units. We 
have a Supernova with escort at 
Bramgar, about fifteen light-years 
from where you are. You are at 
their base, aren't you? Can you 
hold out for two days more?" 

"I think so." 

"Better get into the hills. We 
may have to bombard." 

"Go to hell." I turned off the 
set. 

Now to get back. They must already know it was a trick; they 
must be scouring the base for the 
saboteur. As soon as all loyal men 
were back, the hunt would really 
be on. 

I had, of course, worn gloves. 
There would be no fingerprints. 
And the operator wouldn't know 
who had attacked him. 

I changed the scrambler setting 
to one picked at random. And in 
a corner, as if it had fallen there 
by accident, I dropped a handkerchief stolen from Wergil of Luron. 
The tiny fragments of tissue which 
adhere to such a thing could easily 
be proven to be from him or one 
of his associates, for the basic Luronian life-molecules are all levorotatory. It might help. 

I slipped back down the stairs, 



INSIDE EARTH 



53 



quickly and quietly. It was over. 
The base was as good as taken. 
But there was more to be done. 
Apart from the saving of my own 
life, there was still a desperate need 
for secrecy. For if the rebels knew 
what was coming, they might 
choose to stand and fight, or they 
might flee into the roadless wildernesses of space. Whichever it was, 
all our work and sacrifice would 
have gone for little. 

THE provocateur policy is the 
boldest and most farsighted enterprise ever undertaken. It is the 
first attempt to make history as we 
choose, to control the great social 
forces we are only dimly beginning 
to understand, so that intelligence 
may ultimately be its own master. 

Sure. Very fine and idealistic, and 
no doubt fairly true as well. But 
there is death and treachery in it, 
loneliness and heartbreak, and the 
bitterness of the betrayed. Have we 
the right to set ourselves up as 
God? Can we really say, in our 
omniscience, that everyone but us 
is wrong? There were sane, decent, 
intelligent folk here on Boreas, the 
ones we needed so desperately for 
all civilization. Did we have to 
make them our enemies, so that 
their grandchildren might be our 
friends? 

I didn't know. Wherever I 
turned, there were treason and injustice. However hard I tried to do 
right, I had to wrong somebody. 

I ran on, back to my cabin. I 



peeled off my clothes and dived into 
bed, and by the time they looked in 
on me I had worked back most of 
my fever. 

Don't think, Conru. Don't think 
of this new victory and the safety of 
the Empire. And, perhaps, a step 
closer to the harshly won unity of 
Earth. Don't think of the way the 
light catches in Barbara's hair and 
gets turned into molten gold. 
You've got a fever to create, man. 
You've got to think yourself sick 
again. That ought to be easy. 

VIII 

BARBARA came in. She was 
white and still, and presently 
she leaned her head against my 
breast and cried quietly, for a long 
time. 

"There is a spy here," she told 
me. 

"I heard about it." I stroked her 
hair and held her to me, clumsily. 
"Do you know who it was?" 

"I don't know. Somehow, they 
seem to think the Luronians may be 
guilty, but they aren't sure. They arrested them, and two were killed 
resisting. Colonel Wergil is in the 
brig now, while they decide if 
Luron can still be trusted." 

"It can't," I said. "Earth must 
win alone." 

"We'll win," she said dauntlessly. "With Luron or without it, we'll 
win." Then, like a little frightened 
girl, creeping close to me: "But we 
needed that help so much."

I kissed her and remained silent. 

The next day I got on my feet 
again, weak but recovered. I wandered aimlessly around the base, 
waiting for Barbara to get through 
work, listening to people talk. It 
was ugly, the fear and tension and 
wolfish watchfulness. Whom can we 
trust? Who is the enemy? 

Mostly, they thought the Luronians were guilty. After all, those 
were the only beings on the planet 
who had not had to pass a rigorous 
investigation and psychological examination. But nobody was sure. 

Levinsohn spoke over the televisor. His gaunt, lined face had 
grown very tired, yet there was 
metal in his voice. The new situation necessitated a change of plans, 
but the time of assault would, if 
anything, be moved ahead. "Be of 
good heart. Stand by your comrades. 
We'll still be free!" 

I - went to Barbara's apartment 
and we sat up very late. But even in 
this private record I do not wish to 
say what we talked about. 




ND the next day the Empire 
. came. 



There was one Supernova ship 
with light escort, but that was 
enough. Such vessels have the mass 
of a large asteroid, and one of them 
can sterilize a planet; two or three 
can take it apart. Theoretically, a 
task force comprising twenty Novaclass battleships with escorts can reduce one of those monsters if it is 
willing to lose most of its units. But 



nothing less can even do significant 
damage, and the rebel base did not 
have that much. Nor could they get 
even what they had into full action. 

The ships rushed out of interstellar space, flashing the recognition signals I had given. Before the 
picket vessels suspected what was 
wrong, the Valgolians were on 
them. One managed to bleat a call 
to base and the alarm screamed 
again, men rushed to battle stations. Then the Imperials blanketed 
all communications with a snarl of 
interference through which nothing 
the rebels had could drive. 

So naturally they were thought to 
have been annihilated in a few swift 
blazes of fire and steel, a quick 
clean death and forgetfulness of 
defeat. But only the drivers were 
crippled, and then the Supernova 
yanked the vessels to its titan flanks 
and held them in unbreakable 
gravity beams. The crews would be 
taken later, with narcotic gas or 
paralyzer beams — alive. 

For the Empire needs its rebels. 

I knew the uselessness of going 
to battle stations, so I hung behind, 
seeking out Barbara, whose place 
was with the missile computer bank. 
I met her and Kane in the hallway. 
The boy's face was white, and there 
were tears running down his cheeks. 

"This is the end," he said. 
"They've found us out, and there's 
nothing left but to die. Good by, 
Barbara." He kissed her, wildly, 
and ran for his ship. Moodily, 1 
watched him go. He expected 



INSIDE EARTH 



55 



death, and he would get only capture, and afterward — 

"What are you doing here, 
Con?" asked Barbara. 

"I'm too shaky to be any good in 
the artillery. Let me go with you, I 
can punch a computer." 

She nodded silently, and we 
went off together. 

THE floor shook under us, and a 
crash of rock roared down the 
halls. The heavy weapons on the 
Supernova were bloodlessly reducing our ground installations and our 
ships not yet in action to smashed 
rubble. They would kill not a single 
one of us, except by uncontrollable 
accident, and save many Valgolian 
and Earth lives that way, but it 
wasn't pleasant to be slugged. The 
girl and I staggered ahead. When 
the lights went out, I stopped and 
held her. 

"It's no use," I said. "They've got 
us." 

"Let me go!" she cried. 

I hung on, and suddenly she collapsed against me, crying and shaking. We stood there with the city 
rumbling and shivering around us, 
waiting. 

Presently the Valgolian commander released the interference 
and contacted Levinsohn, offering 
terms of surrender. It seemed to 
Levinsohn, and it was meant to 
seem, that further resistance would 
be useless butchery. His ships were 
gone and his foes need only bombard him to ruin. He capitulated, 



and one by one we laid down our 
arms and filed to meet the victors. 

The terms, as announced by messengers — the intercom was out of 
action — were generous. Leading 
rebels and those judged potentially 
"dangerous" would go to penal 
colonies on various Earthlike 
planets. Except that they weren't 
penal colonies at all, but, of course, 
the Earthlings wouldn't know this. 
They were indoctrination centers, 
and, with all my bitterness, I still 
longed to observe a man like Levinsohn after five years in one of the 
centers. He'd see things in a different perspective. He'd see the Empire for what it was — even if I 
sometimes had a little trouble seeing 
that now — and he'd be a better 
rebel for it. 

Someday Levinsohn and his kind 
would be back on Earth, the new 
leaders ready to lead the way to a 
new tomorrow. And I would be 
with them. 

I'd be back with Levinsohn and 
the rest, and with Barbara, too, and 
we'd try to pave the way to the 
peace and friendship. But meanwhile there'd be other revolutions — 
striving and hoping and breaking 
their hearts daring what they 
thought would be death to win what 
they called freedom and what we 
hoped would be evolution. 

It was the fire to temper a new 
civilization. 

We walked down the hall, Barbara and I, hand in hand, alone in 
spite of all the people who were 



56 




 



shuffling the same way. Most of 
them were weeping. But Barbara's 
head was high now. 

"What will happen to us?" she 
asked. 

"I don't know," I said. "But, 
Barbara, whatever happens after 
this, remember that I love you. Remember that I'll always love you." 

"I love you too," she smiled, and 
kissed me. "We'll be together, Con. 
That's all that matters. We'll be together." 

That was important — and it made 
me feel good. Yes, we'd be together; I'd see to that. But for a 
while Barbara would hate me 
through all the long years of the 
indoctrination. Someday, perhaps, 
she would understand . . . the indoctrination could do it, and I 
could help. But by the gods of 
space, how would it be to take that 
hate all that while? 

WE came out into the central 
chamber where the prisoners 
were gathering to be herded up to 
the ships. Armed Valgolian guards 
stood under the glare of improvised 
lights. Other Imperials were going 
through the city, flushing out those 
who might be hiding and removing 
whatever our armed forces could 
use. The equipment would do no 
one any good here, and Boreas 
would be left to its darkness. 

It was cold in the vast shadowy 
room. The heating plant had broken 
down and the ancient cold of 
Boreas was seeping in. Barbara 



shivered and I held her close to me. 
Nat Hawkins moved over to join 
us, wordlessly. 

I was questioned in a locked 
room by one of the big Valgolian 
officers. He looked at a stereograph 
in his hand and he took me aside, 
but it was not unusual. Many of the 
starbound prisoners were being 
questioned by their guards, and I 
was merely one of them. 

"Colonel Halgen?" the officer 
asked with an eagerness close to 
hero-worship. He was obviously 
fresh from school and military 
terminology came from his lips as if 
it really meant something to a Valgolian. The colonel, of course, 
meant that in a titular sense I had 
been elevated for my work. Funny, 
if you use the language enough, you 
get to believe it yourself. 

"Sir," the young officer continued, "this is one of the greatest 
pieces of work I've ever seen. I am 
to extend the official congratulations of — " 

I let him talk for a while and 
then I raised my hand peremptorily 
and I told him that the girl with the 
Earthling Hawkins was to go along 
for indoctrination, despite the fact 
that her name did not appear on his 
lists. He nodded, and I went back 
to Barbara, but half a dozen men 
had come between us. 

Levinsohn and five guards. The 
man's carriage was still erect, the 
old unbreakable pride and courage 
were still in him. Someone among 
the prisoners broke loose and 



INSIDE EARTH 



57 



rushed at him, cursing, till the Valgolians thrust him back into line. 

"Levinsohn!" screamed the man. 
"Levinsohn, you dirty Jew, you sold 
us out!" 

There you see why this rebellion 
had to be crushed. Earth still had 
.1 long way to go. The Levinsohns, 
the Barbaras, the more promising of 
ihe anarchs would be educated and 
returned and the civilizing process 
would go on. Earth's best and 
bravest would unite and fight us, 
and with each defeat they would 
learn something of what we had to 
teach them, that all races, however 
divergent, must respect each other 
and work together, learn it with an 
intensity which the merely intellectual teaching of schools and 
propaganda could not achieve alone 
— or, at any rate, soon enough. 

Valgolia is the great and lonely 
enemy, the self-appointed Devil 
since none of us can be angels. It is 
the source of challenge and adversity such as has always driven intelligence onward and upward, in 
spite of itself. 

Sooner or later, generations 
hence, perhaps, all the subject 
worlds will have attained internal 
unity, forgetting their very species 
in a common bond of intelligence. 
And on that day Valgolia's work 
will be done. She and her few 
friends, her donagangors, will seemingly capitulate without a fight and 
become simply part of a union of 
free and truly civilized planets. 

And such a union will be firmer 



and more enduring than all the 
tyrant empires of the past. It will 
have the strength of a thousand or 
more races, working together in the 
harmony which they achieved in 
struggling against us. 

THAT is the goal, but it is a 
long way ahead; there may be 
centuries needed, and meanwhile 
Valgolia is alone. 

Barbara would understand. In 
time she would understand what she 
as yet did not even know. But first 
would be the hatred, the cold stark 
hatred that must come of knowing 
who and what I really am. I could 
only wait for that hatred to come 
after she learned, and then wait for 
it to go, slowly, slowly. . . . 

Lines of the Earthlings were filing forward, and, with Nat Hawkins, Barbara waited for me. I 
walked to her and took her hand. 
Her head was high, as high as Levinsohn 's. She expected all of- us to 
die, but she'd meet the relatives and 
friends she thought were dead. 

It would be a great, a crushing 
humiliation, to know one's martyrs 
were alive and being well treated 
and intensively educated by the foe, 
who was supporting and encouraging one's supposedly dangerous 
revolution. 

"It won't be so bad as long as 
we're together, darling," I said. 

She smiled, misunderstanding, 
and kissed me defiantly before our 
Valgolian guards.
