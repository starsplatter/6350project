WHEREVER YOU MAY BE by James Gunn 

MATT refused to believe it. 
Vacant incredulity paralyzed him for a moment 
as he stared after the fleeing, 
bounding tire. Then, with a sudden release, he sprinted after it. 

"Stop!" he yelled futilely. 
"Stop, damn it!" 

With what seemed like sadistic 
glee, the tire bounced high in 
the air and landed going faster 
than ever. Matt pounded down 
the hot dusty road for a hundred 
yards before he pulled up even 
with it. He knocked it over on its 



side. The tire lay there, spinning 
and frustrate, like a turtle on its 
back. Matt glared at it suspiciously. Sweat trickled down his neck. 

A tinkling of little silver bells. 
Laughter? Matt looked up quickly, angrily. The woods were thin 
along the top of this Ozark ridge. 
Descending to the lake, sparkling cool and blue far below, they 
grew thicker, but the only one 
near was the young girl shuffling 
through the dust several hundred 
yards beyond the crippled car. 
And her head was bent down to

TN shimmering heat waves and 
a slowly settling haze of red 
dust, he righted the tire and began to roll it back toward the 
green Ford with one bare metal 
wheel drum pointing upward at 
a slight angle. The tire rolled 
easily, as if it repented its brief 
dash for freedom, but it was a 
dirty job and Mart's hands and 
clothes were soiled red when he 
reached the car. 

With one hand clutching the 
tire, Matt studied the road for 
a moment. He could have sworn 
that he had stopped on one of the 
few level stretches in these hills, 
but the tire had straightened up 
from the side of the car and 
started rolling as If the car were 
parked on a steep incline. 

Matt reflected bitterly on the 
luck that had turned a slow leak 
into a flat only twenty-five miles 
from the cabin. It couldn't have 
happened on the highway, ten 
miles back, where he'd have been 
able to pull into a service station. 
No, it had to wait until he 
couldn't get out of this rutted cow 
track. The tire's escapade had 
been only the most recent of a 
series of annoyances and irritations to which bruised shins and 
scraped knuckles were painful 
affidavits. 

He sighed. After all, he had 
wanted isolation. Guy's offer of a 
hunting cabin in which to finish 
his thesis had seemed like a god


send at the time, but now Matt 
wasn't so certain. If this was a 
fair sample, Matt was beginning 
to see how much of his time would 
be wasted just on the problems 
of existence. 

Cautiously, Matt rolled the tire 
to the rear of the car, laid it carefully on its side, and completed 
pulling the spare from the trunk. 
Warily, he maneuvered the spare 
to the left rear wheel, knelt, lifted 
it, fitted it over the bolts, and 
stepped back. He sighed again, 
but this time with relief. 

Kling-ng! Klang! Rattle! 

Matt hastily looked down. His 
foot was at least two inches from 
the hub cap, but it was rocking 
now, empty. Matt saw the last 
nut roll under the car. 

Matt's swearing was vigorous, 
systematic, and exhaustive. It 
concerned itself chiefly with the 
perversity of inanimate objects. 

There was something about 
machines and the things they 
made which was basically alien 
to the human spirit. They might 
disguise themselves for a time as 
willing slaves, but eventually, inevitably, they turned against their 
masters. At the psychological 
moment, they rebelled. 

Or perhaps it was the difference in people. For some people, 
things always went wrong — their 
cakes fell; their lumber split; their 
golf balls sliced into the rough. 
Others established a mysterious 



6 




 



sympathy with their tools. 

Luck? Skill? Coordination? Experience? 

It was, he felt, something more 
conscious and malignant. 

T*J"ATT remembered a neardisastrous brush with chemistry; he had barely passed 
qualitative analysis. For him the 
tests had been worse than useless. 
Faithfully he had gone through 
every step of the endless ritual: 
precipitate, filter, dissolve, precipitate . . . And then he would 
take his painfully secured, neatly 
written results to — what was his 
name? — Wadsworth, and the little 
chemistry professor would study 
his analysis and look up, frowning. 

"Didn't you find any whatyoumaycallit oxide?" he would ask. 

"Whatyoumaycallit oxide?" 
Startled. "Oh, there wasn't any 
whatyoumaycallit oxide." 

And Wadsworth would make a 
simple test and, sure enough, 
there would be the whatyoumaycallit oxide. 

There was the inexplicably 
misshapen gear Matt had made 
on the milling machine, the drafting pen that would not draw a 
smooth line no matter how much 
he sanded the point . . . 

It had convinced Matt that his 
hands were too clumsy to belong 
to an engineer. He had transferred 
his ambitions to a field where 



tools were less tangible. Now he 
wondered. 

Kobolds? Accident prones? 

Some time he would have to 
write it up. It would make a 
good paper for the Journal of — 

Laughter! This time there was 
no possible doubt. It came from 
right behind him. 

Matt whirled. The girl stood 
there, hugging her ribs to keep 
the laughter in. She was a young 
little thing, not much over five 
feet tall, in a shapeless, faded, 
blue dress. Her feet were small 
and bare and dirty. Her hair, in 
long braids, was mouse-colored. 
Her pale face was saved from 
plainness only by her large, blue 
eyes. 

Matt flushed. "What the devil 
are you laughing at?" 

"You!" she got out between 
chuckles. "Whyn't you get a 
horse?" 

"Did that remark just arrive 
here?" 

He swallowed his irritation, 
turned, and got down on his 
hands and knees to peer under 
the car. One by one he gathered 
up the nuts, but the last one, 
inevitably, was out of reach. 
Sweating, he crawled all the way 
under. 

TJPTHEN he came out, the girl 
was still there. "What are 
you waiting for?" he asked bitingly. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE

"Nothin'." But she stood with 
her feet planted firmly in the red 
dust. 

Kibitzers annoyed Matt, but 
he couldn't think of anything to 
do about it. He twirled the nuts 
onto the bolts and tightened them 
up, his neck itching. It might 
have been the effect of sweat and 
dust, but he was not going to 
give the girl the satisfaction of 
seeing him rub it. That annoyed 
him even more. He tapped the 
hub cap into place and stood up. 

"Why don't you go home?" he 
asked sourly. • 

"Cain't," she said. 

He went to the rear of the car 
and released the jack. "Why not?" 

"I run away." Her voice was 
quietly tragic. 

Matt turned to look at her. 
Her blue eyes were large and 
moist. As he watched, a single 
tear gathered and traced a muddy 
path down her cheek. 

Matt hardened his heart. 
"Tough." He picked up the flat 
and stuffed it into the trunk and 
slammed the lid. The sun was 
getting lower, and on this forgotten lane to nowhere it might 
take him the better part of an 
hour to drive the twenty-five 
miles. 

He slid into the driver's seat 
and punched the starter button. 
After one last look at the forlorn 
little figure in the middle of the 
road, he shook his head savagely 



and let in the clutch. 

"Mister! Hey, mister!" 

He slammed on the brakes and 
stuck his head out the window. 
"Now what do you want?" 

"Nothin'," she said mournfully. 
"Only you forgot your jack." 

Matt jammed the gear shift 
into reverse and backed up rapidly. Silently, he got out, picked up 
the jack, opened the trunk, tossed 
in the jack, slammed the lid. But 
as he brushed past her again, he 
hesitated. "Where are you going?" 

"No place," she said. 

"What do you mean 'no place'? 
Don't you have any relatives?" 
She shook her head. "Friends?" 
he asked hopefully. She shook her 
head again. "All right, then, go on 
home!" 

He slid into the car and banged 
the door. She was not his concern. 
The car jerked into motion. No 
doubt she would go home when 
she got hungry enough. He shifted 
into second, grinding the gears. 
Even if she didn't, someone would 
take her in. After all, he was no 
welfare agency. 

He grudgingly slowed, then 
angrily backed up and skidded 
to a stop beside the girl. 

"Get in," he said. 

rpRYING to keep the car out 
of the ruts was trouble enough, 
but the girl jumped up and down 
on the seat beside him, squealing 
happily.

"Careful of those notes," he 
said, indicating the bulging manila folders on the seat between 
them. "There's over a year's work 
in those." 

Her eyes were wide as she 
watched him place the folders in 
the back seat on top of the portable typewriter that rested between the twenty-pound sack of 
flour and the case of eggs. 

"A year's work?" she echoed 
wonderingly. 

"Notes. For the thesis I'm going to write." 

"You write stories?" 

"A research paper I have to do 
to get my degree." He glanced 
at her blank expression and then 
looked back at the road. "It's 
called," he said with a nasty 
superior smile, " 'The Psychodynamics of Witchcraft, with Special Reference to the Salem Trials 
of 1692.' " 

"Oh," she said wisely. 
"Witches." As if she knew all 
about witches. 

Matt felt unreasonably annoyed. "All right, where do you 
live?" 

She stopped bouncing and got 
very quiet. "I cain't go home." 

"Why not?" he demanded. 
"And don't tell me 'I run away,' " 
he imitated nasally. 

"Paw'd beat me again. He'd 
purty nigh skin me alive, I guess." 

"You mean he hits you?" 

"He don't use his fists — not 



often. He uses his belt mostly. 
Look." She pulled up the hem of 
her dress and the leg of a pair of 
baggy drawers that appeared to 
be made from some kind of sacking. 

Matt looked quickly and 
glanced away. Across the back of 
one thigh was an ugly dark bruise. 
But the leg seemed unusually well 
rounded for a girl so small and 
young. Matt frowned thoughtfully. Did girls in the hills mature 
that early? 

He cleared his throat. "Why 
does he do that?" 

"He's just mean." 

"He must have some reason." 

"Well," she said thoughtfully, 
"he beats me when he's drunk 
'cause he's drunk, and he beats 
me when he's sober 'cause he ain't 
drunk. That covers it mostly." 

"But what does he say?" 

She glanced at him shyly. "Oh, 
I cain't repeat it." 

"I mean what does he want you 
to do?" 

"Oh, that!" She brooded over it. 
"He thinks I ought to get married. He wants me to catch some 
strong young feller who'll do the 
work when he moves in with us. 
A gal don't bring in no money, 
he says, leastwise not a good one. 
That kind only eats and wants 
things." 

"Married?" Matt said. "But 
you're much too young to get 
married." 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE

OHE glanced at him out of the 
^ corner of her eye. "I'm sixteen," she said. "Most girls my 
age got a couple of young 'uns. 
One, anyways." 

Matt looked at her sharply. 
Sixteen? It seemed impossible. 
The dress was shapeless enough 
to hide almost anything — but sixteen! Then he remembered the 
thigh. 

She frowned. "Get married, get 
married! You'd think I didn't 
want to get married. 'Tain't my 
fault no feller wants me." 

"I can't understand that," Matt 
said sarcastically. 

She smiled at him. "You're 
nice." 

She looked almost pretty when 
she smiled. For a hill girl. 

"What seems to be the 
trouble?" Matt asked hurriedly. 

"Partly Paw," she said. "No 
one'd want to have him around. 
But mostly I guess I'm just unlucky." She sighed. "One feller I 
went with purty near a year. He 
busted his leg. Another nigh 
drownded when he fell in the lake. 
Don't seem right they should 
blame me, even if we did have 
words." 

"Blame you?" 

She nodded vigorously. "Them 
as don't hate me say it's courtin' 
disaster 'stead of a gal. The others 
weren't so nice. Fellers stopped 
comin'. One of 'em said he'd 
rather marry up with a cata


mount. You married, Mister — 
Mister—?" 

"Matthew Wright. No, I'm not 
married." 

She nodded thoughtfully. 
"Wright. Abigail Wright. That's 
purty." 

"Abigail Wright?" 

"Did I say that? Now, ain't 
that funny? My name's Jenkins." 

Matt gulped. "You're going 
home," he said with unshakable 
conviction. "You can tell me how 
to get there or you can climb 
out of the car right now." 

"But Paw—" 

"Where the devil did you think 
I was taking you?" 

"Wherever you're going," she 
said, wide-eyed. 

"For God's sake, you can't go 
with me! It wouldn't be decent." 

"Why not?" she asked innocently. 

In silence, Matt began to apply 
the brakes. 

"All right," she sighed. She 
wore an expression the early 
Christians must have worn before they were marched into the 
arena. "Turn right at the next 
cross road." 

/CHICKENS scattered in front 
^ of the wheels, fluttering and 
squawking; pigs squealed in a pen 
beside the house. Matt stopped 
in front of the shanty, appalled. 
If the two rooms and sagging 
porch had ever known paint, they 



10 




 



had enjoyed only a nodding acquaintance, and that a generation 
before. 

A large brooding figure sat on 
the porch, rocking slowly in a 
rickety chair. He was dark, with 
a full black beard and a tall head 
of hair. 

"That's Paw," Abigail whispered in fright. 

Matt waited uneasily, but the 
broad figure of her father kept on 
rocking as if strangers brought 
back his daughter every day. 
Maybe they do, Matt thought 
with irritation. 

"Well," he said nervously, "here 
you are." 

"I cain't get out," Abigail said. 
"Not till I find out if Paw's goih' 
to whale me. Go talk to him. See 
if he's mad at me." 

"Not me," Matt stated with 
certainty, glancing again at the 
big, black figure rocking slowly, 
ominously silent. "I've done my 
duty in bringing you home. 
Good-by. I won't say it's been a 
pleasure knowing you." 

"You're nice and mighty hand- ' 
some. I'd hate to tell Paw you'd 
taken advantage of me. He's a 
terror when he's riled." 

For one horrified moment, Matt 
stared at Abigail. Then, as she 
opened her mouth, he opened the 
door and stepped out. Slowly he 
walked up to the porch and put 
one foot on its uneven edge. 

"Uh," he said. "I met your 



daughter on the road." 

Jenkins kept on rocking. 

"She'd run away," Matt went 
on. 

Jenkins was silent. Matt studied 
the portion of Jenkins's face that 
wasn't covered with hair. There 
wasn't much of it, but what there 
was Matt didn't like. 

"I brought her back," Matt 
finished desperately. 

Jenkins rocked and said nothing. Matt spun around and 
walked quickly back to the car. 
He went around to the window 
where Abigail sat. He reached 
through the window, opened the 
glove compartment, and drew out 
a full pint bottle. 

"Remind me," he said, "never 
to see you again." He marched 
back to the porch. "Care for a 
little drink?" 

/"kNE large hand reached but, 

smothered the pint, and I 
brought it close to faded blue 
overalls. The cap was twisted off 
by the other hand. The bottle 
was tilted toward the unpainted 
porch ceiling as soon as the neck 
disappeared into the matted 
whiskers. The bottle gurgled. 
When it was lowered, it was only 
half full. 

"Weak," the beard said. But 
the hand that held the bottle held 
it tight. 

"I brought your daughter 
back," Matt said, starting again. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



11 



"Why?" he asked. 

"She had no place to go. I 
mean — after all, this is her home." 

"She run away," the beard said. 
Matt found the experience extremely unnerving. 

"Look, Mr. Jenkins, I realize 
that teen-age daughters can be 
a nuisance, and after meeting 
your daughter I think I can understand how you feel. Still in 
all, she is your daughter." 

"Got my doubts." 

Matt gulped and tried once 
more. "A happy family demands 
a lot of compromise, give-andtake on both sides. Your daughter 
may have given you good cause 
to lose your temper, but beating 
a child is never sound psychology. 
Now if you — " 

"Beat her?" Jenkins rose from 
his chair. It was an awesome 
thing, like Neptune rising out of 
the sea in all his majesty, gigantic, 
I bearded, and powerful. Even subtracting the height of the porch, 
Jenkins loomed several inches 
over Matt's near six feet. "Never 
laid a hand to her. Dassn't." 

My God, thought Matt, the 
man is trembling! 

"Come in here," said Jenkins. 
He waved the pint toward the 
open door, a dark rectangle. 

Uneasily, Matt walked into the 
room. Under his feet, things 
gritted and cracked. 

Jenkins lit a kerosene lamp and 
turned it up. The room was a 



shambles. Broken dishes littered 
the floor. Wooden chairs were 
smashed and splintered. In the 
center of the room, a table on its 
back waved three rough legs helplessly in the air; the fourth leg 
sagged pitifully from its socket. 

"She did this?" Matt asked 
weakly. 

"This ain't nothin'." Jenkins' 
voice quavered; it was a terrible 
sound to come from that massive 
frame. "You should see the other 
room." 

"But how? I mean why?" 

"1 ain't a-sayin' Ab done it," 
Jenkins said, shaking his head. 
His beard wobbled near Matt's 
nose. "But when she gets onhappy, things happen. And she 
was powerful onhappy when that 
Duncan boy tol' her he wan't 
comin' back. Them chairs come 
up from the floor and slam down. 
That table went dancin' round 
the room till it fell to pieces. 
Then dishes come a-flyin' through 
the air. Look!" 

His voice was full of self-pity 
as he turned his head around and 
parted his long, matted hair. On 
the back of his head was a large, 
red swelling. "I hate to think 
what happened to that Duncan 
boy." 

TTE shook his head sorrowfully. 

"Now, mister, I guess I got 
ever' right to lay my hand to that 
gal. Ain't I?" he demanded fierce


12 




 



ly, but his voice broke. 

Matt stared at him blankly. 

"But whop her? Me? I sooner 
stick my hand in a nest of 
rattlers." 

"You mean to say that those 
things happened all by themselves?" 

"That's what I said. I guess it 
kinder sticks in your craw. 
Wouldn't have believe it myself, 
even seein' it and feelin' it — " he 
rubbed the back of his head — "if 
it ain't happen afore. Funny 
things happen around Ab, ever 
since she started fillin' out, fivesix year ago." 

"But she's only sixteen," Matt 
objected. 

"Sixteen?" Jenkins glanced 
warily around the room and out 
the door toward the car. He lowered his voice to a harsh whisper.. 
"Don't let on I tol' you, but Ab 
alius was a fibber. She's past 
eighteen!" 

From a shelf, a single unbroken 
dish crashed to the floor at Jenkins' feet. He jumped and began 
to shake. 

"See?" he whispered plaintively. 

"It fell," Matt said. 

"She's witched." Jenkins took 
a feverish swallow from the bottle. 
"Maybe I ain't been a good Paw 
to her. Ever since her Maw died, 
she run wild and got all kinda 
queer notions. 'Taint alius been 
bad. For years I ain't had to go 



fer water. That barrel by the 
porch is alius filled. But ever 
since she got to the courtin' age 
and started bein' disappointed in 
fellers round about, she been 
mighty hard to live with. No 
one'll come nigh the place. And 
things keep a-movin' and a-jumpin' around till a man cain't trust 
his own chair to set still under 
him. It gets you, son. A man kin 
only stand so much!" 

To Mart's dismay, Jenkins's 
eyes began to fill with large tears. 
"Got no friend no more to offer 
me a drink now and again, 
sociable-like, or help me with the 
chores, times I got the misery in 
my back. I ain't a well man, son. 
Times it's more'n I kin do to get 
outa bed in the mornin'. 

"Look, son," Jenkins said, 
turning to Matt pleadingly. "Yore 
a city feller. Yore right nicelookin' with manners and edyacation. I reckon Ab likes you. 
Whyn't you take her with you?" 
Matt started retreating toward 
the door. "She's right purty when 
she fixes up and she kin cook 
right smart. You'd think a skillet 
was part of her hand, the way she 
kin handle one, and you don't 
even have to marry up with her." 

]%/|"ATT backed away, whitefaced and incredulous. "You 
must be mad. You can't give a 
girl away like that." He turned 
to make a dash for the door. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



13 



A heavy hand fell on Matt's 
shoulder and spun him around. 
"Son," Jenkins said, his voice 
heavy with menace, "any man 
that's alone with a gal more'n 
twenty minutes, it's thought 
proper they should get married 
up quick. Since yore a stranger, 
I ain't holdin' you to it. But when 
Ab left me, she stopped bein' my 
daughter. Nobody asked you to 
bring her back. That gal," he said 
woefully, "eats more'n I do." 

Matt reached into his hip 
pocket. He pulled out his billfold 
and extracted a five dollar bill. 

"Here," he said, extending it 
toward Jenkins, "maybe this will 
make life a little more pleasant." 

Jenkins looked at the money 
wistfully, started to reach for it, 
and jerked his hand away. 

"I cain't do it," he moaned. "It 
ain't worth it. You brought her 
back. You kin take her away." 

Matt glanced out the doorway 
toward the car and shuddered. He 
added another five to the one in 
his hand. 

Jenkins sweated. His hand 
crept out. Finally, desperately, he 
crumpled the bills into his palm. 
"All right," he said hoarsely. 

"Them's ten mighty powerful reasons." 

Matt ran to the car as if he had 
escaped from bedlam. He opened 
the door and slipped in. "Get 
out," he said sharply. "You're 
home." 



"But Paw—" 

"From now on, he'll be a doting father." Matt reached across 
and opened the door for her. 
"Good-by." 

Slowly Abigail got out. She 
rounded the car and walked up 
to the porch, dragging her feet. 
But when she reached the porch, 
she straightened up. Jenkins, who 
was standing in the doorway, 
shrank back from his five-foottall daughter as she approached. 

"Dirty, nasty old man," Abigail 
hissed. 

Jenkins flinched. After she had 
passed, he raised the bottle hastily to his beard. His hand must 
have slipped. By some unaccountable mischance, the bottle 
kept rising in the air, mouth 
downward. The bourbon gushed 
over his head. 

Pathetically, looking more like 
Neptune than ever, Jenkins 
peered toward the car and shook 
his head. 

Feverishly, Matt turned the car 
around and jumped the car out of 
the yard. It had undoubtedly 
been an optical illusion. A bottle 
does not hang in the air without 
support. 

/"^UY'S cabin should not have 
been so difficult to find. Although the night was dark, the 
directions were explicit. But for 
two hours Matt bounced back 
and forth along the dirt roads of 



14 




 



the hills. He got tired and hungry. 

For the fourth time, he passed 
the cabin which fitted the directions in every way but one — it 
was occupied. Lights streamed 
from the windows into the night. 
Matt turned into the steep driveway. He could, at least, ask directions. 

As he walked toward the door, 
the odor of frying ham drifted 
from the house to tantalize him. 
Matt knocked, his mouth watering. Perhaps he could even get 
an invitation to supper. 

The door swung open. "Come 
on in. What kept you?" 

Matt blinked. "Oh, no!" he 
cried. For a frantic moment, it 
was like the old vaudeville routine of the drunk in the hotel who 
keeps staggering back to knock 
on the same door. Each time he 
is more indignantly ejected until 
finally he complains, "My God, 
are you in all the rooms?" 

"What are you doing here?" 
Matt asked faintly. "How did 
you — How could you — ?" 

Abigail pulled him into the 
cabin. It looked bright and cheerful and clean. The floor was newly swept; a broom leaned in the 
corner. The two lower bunks on 
opposite walls were neatly made 
up. Two places were laid at the 
table. Food was cooking on the 
wood stove. 

"Paw changed his mind," she 
said. 



"But he couldn't! I gave 
him—" 

"Oh, that." She reached into a 
pocket of her dress. "Here." 

She handed him the two crumpled five dollar bills and a handful of silver and copper that Matt 
dazedly added up to one dollar 
and thirty-seven cents. 

"Paw said he'd have sent more, 
but it was all he had. So he 
threw in some vittles." 

He sat down in a chair heavily. 
"But you couldn't — I didn't know 
where the place was myself, exactly. I didn't tell you—" 

"I always been good at finding 
things," she said. "Places, things 
that are lost. Like a cat, I guess." 

"But — but — " Matt spluttered, 
"how did you get here?" 

"I rode," she said. Instinctively, 
Mart's eyes switched to the broom 
in the corner. "Paw loaned me 
the mule. I let her go. She'll get 
home all right." 

"But you can't stay here. It's 
impossible!" 

"Now, Mr. Wright," Abigail 
said soothingly. "My Maw used 
to say a man should never make 
a decision on a empty stomach. 
You just sit there and relax. Supper's all ready. You must be nigh 
starved." 

"There's no decision to be 
made!" Matt said, but he watched 
while she put things on the table 
— thick slices of fried ham with 
cream gravy, corn on the cob, 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE

fluffy biscuits, butter, homemade 
jelly, strong black coffee that was 
steaming and fragrant. Abigail's 
cheeks were flushed from the 
stove, and her face was peaceful. 
She looked almost pretty. 

"I can't eat a bite," Matt told 
her. 

"Nonsense." Abigail filled his 
plate. 

|^LUMLY, Matt sliced off a 
^-^ bite of ham and put it in his 
mouth. It was so tender, it almost 
melted. Before long he was eating 
as fast as he could shovel the 
food into his mouth. The food 
was delicious; everything was 
cooked just as he liked it. He had 
never been able to tell anyone 
how to fix it that way. But that 
was the way it was. 

He pushed himself back from 
the table, teetering against the 
wall on the back legs of his chair, 
lit a cigarette and watched Abigail pour him a third cup of 
coffee. He was swept by a wave 
of contentment. 

"If I'd had time I'd a made a 
peach pie. I make real good peach 
pie," Abigail said. 

Matt nodded lazily. There 
would be compensations in having someone around to — 

"No!" he said violently, thumping down on the two front legs 
of his chair. "It won't work. You 
can't stay here. What would people say?" 



"Who'd care? — Paw don't. 
Anyways, I could say we was 
married." 

"No!" Matt said hoarsely. 
"Please don't do that!" 

"Please, Mr. Wright," she 
pleaded, "let me cook and clean 
for you. I wouldn't be no trouble, 
Mr. Wright, honest I wouldn't." 

"Look, Abbie!" He took her 
hand. It was soft and feminine. 
She stood beside his chair obediently, her eyes cast down. 
"You're a nice girl, and I like 
you. You can cook better than 
anyone I've ever known, and 
you'll make some man a good 
wife. But I think too much of 
you to let you ruin your name by 
staying here along with me. 
You'll have to go back to your 
father." 

The life seemed to flow out of 
her. "All right," she said, so low 
that it was difficult to hear her. 

Dazed at his sudden success, 
Matt got up and walked toward 
the door. She followed him, and 
Matt could almost feel the tears 
welling in her eyes. 

Matt opened the car door for 
her and helped her in. He circled 
the front of the car and slid into 
the driver's seat. Abbie huddled 
against the far door, small and 
forlorn. 

Since Matt's speech, she hadn't 
said a word. Suddenly, Matt felt 
very sorry for her and ashamed, 
as if he had hit a child. The poor 



16 




 



little thing! he thought. Then he 
caught himself. He shook his 
head. For a poor little thing, she 
had certainly managed to browbeat her father. 

He thumbed the starter button, 
and the motor growled, but it 
didn't catch. Matt let it whine 
to a stop and pressed again. The 
motor moaned futilely. Matt 
checked the ignition. It was on. 
Again and again he pushed in 
the button. The moans got weaker. He tried to roll the car — 
but the brakes locked. 

T¥E glanced suspiciously at Abigail. Bur that's absurd, he 
thought. Since he had met Abbie, 
his thoughts had taken a definite 
paranoid tinge. It was foolish to 
blame everything that went wrong 
on the girl. 

But the car wouldn't move. He 
gave up. 

"All right," he sighed. "I can't 
put you out this far from home. 
You can sleep here tonight." 

Silently, she followed him into 
the cabin. She helped him tack 
blankets to the upper bunks on 
each side of the cabin. They made 
an effective curtain around the 
lower beds. As they worked, Matt 
discovered that he was unusually 
sensitive to her nearness. There 
was a sweet, womanly smell to 
her, and when she brushed agairrst 
him the spot that was touched 
came to life — tingling awareness. 



When they finished, Abbie 
reached down and grasped the 
hem of her dress to pull it off 
over her head. 

"No, no," Matt said hurriedly. 
"Don't you have any modesty? 
Why do you think we tacked up 
those blankets?" He gestured to 
the bunk on the left hand wall. 
"Dress and undress in there." 

She let the hem of her dress 
fall, nodded meekly, and climbed 
into the bunk. 

Matt stared after her for a moment and released his breath. He 
turned and climbed into his own 
bunk, undressed, and slipped 
under the blanket. Then he remembered that he had forgotten 
to turn out the lamps. 

He rose on one elbow and heard 
a soft padding on the floor. The 
lamps went out, one by one, and 
the padding faded to the other 
side of the room. Rustling sounds. 
Darkness and silence. 

"Good night, Mr. Wright." It 
was a little child's voice in the 
night. 

"Good night, Abbie," he said 
softly. And then after a moment, 
firmly, "But don't *forget — back 
you go first thing in the morning." 

Before the silence wove a pattern of sleep, Matt heard a little 
sound from the other bunk. He 
couldn't quite identify it. 

A sob? A snore? Or a muffled 
titter? 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



17 



^T^HE odor of frying bacon and 
boiling coffee crept into Matt's 
nightmare of a terrifying pursuit 
by an implacable and invisible 
enemy. Matt opened his eyes. The 
bunk was bright with diffused 
sunlight; the dream faded. Matt 
sniffed hungrily and pushed aside 
the blanket to look out. 

All the supplies from the car 
had been unloaded and neatly 
stowed away. On a little corner 
table by the window were his 
typewriter and precious manila 
folders, and a stack of blank 
white paper. 

Matt dressed hurriedly in his 
cramped quarters. When he 
emerged from his cocoon, Abbie 
was humming happily as she set 
breakfast on the table. She wore 
a different dress this morning — a 
brown calico that did horrible 
things for her hair and coloring, 
but fitted better than the blue 
gingham. The dress revealed a 
slim but unsuspectedly mature 
figure. 

How would she look, he wondered briefly, in good clothes and 
nylons, shoes, and make-up? 

The thought crumbled before 
a fresh onslaught to his senses 
of the odor and sight of breakfast. 
The eggs were cooked just right, 
sunny side up, the white firm but 
not hard. It was strange how 
Abbie anticipated his preferences. 
At first he thought that she had 
overestimated his appetite, but 



he stowed away three eggs while 
Abbie ate two, heartily. 

He pushed back his plate with 
a sigh. "Well," he began. She got 
very quiet and stared at the floor. 
His heart melted. He felt too contented ; a few hours more wouldn't 
make any difference. Tonight 
would be time enough for her to 
go back. "Well," he repeated, "I 
guess I'd better get to work." 

Abbie sprang to clear the table. 
Matt walked to the corner where 
the typewriter was waiting. He 
sat down in the chair and rolled 
in a sheet of paper. The table was 
well arranged for light; it was 
the right height. Everything considered, it was just about perfect 
for working. 

He stared at the blank sheet 
of paper. He leafed through his 
notes. He resisted an impulse to 
get up and walk around. He 
rested his fingers lightly on the 
keys and after a moment lifted 
them, crossed one leg over the 
other knee, put his right elbow 
on the raised leg, and began to 
finger his chin. 

There was only one thing 
wrong: he didn't feel like working. 

Finally he typed in the middle 
of the page: 

THE PSYCHODYNAMICS OF 
WITCHCRAFT 

With Special Reference to the 

Salem Trials of 1692 
He double-spaced and stopped. 



18 




 



TT wasn't that Abbie was noisy; 

she was too quiet, with a kind 
of purposeful restraint that is 
worse than chaos. With one ear 
Matt listened to the sounds of 
dishwashing and stacking. And 
then silence. 

Matt stood it as long as he 
could and turned. Abbie was 
seated at the table. She was sewing up a hole in the pocket of 
his other pair of pants. He could 
almost see the aura of bliss that 
surrounded her. 

Like a child, Matt thought, 
playing at domesticity. But there 
was something mature about it, 
too; a mature and basic fulfillment. // we could all be happy 
with so little. Ifs a pity, with so 
small an ambition, to have the 
real thing so elusive. 

As if she felt him looking at 
her, Abbie glanced around and 
beamed. Matt turned back to his 
typewriter. It still wouldn't come. 

Witchcraft, he began hesitantly, is the attempt of the primitive 
mind to bring order out of chaos. 
It is significant, therefore, that 
belief in witchcraft fades as an 
understanding of the natural 
workings of the physical universe grows more prevalent. 

He let his hands drop. It was 
all wrong, like an image seen in 
a distorted mirror. He swung 
around: "Who wrecked your 
father's house?" 

"Libby," she said. 

WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



"Libby?" Matt echoed, "Who's 
Libby?" 

"The other me," Abbie said 
calmly. "Mostly I keep her bottled up inside, but when I feel' 
sad and unhappy I can't keep her 
in. Then she gets loose and just 
goes wild. I can't control her.'" 

Good God! Matt thought, 
Schizophrenia! "Where did you 
get an idea like that?" he asked 
cautiously. 

"When I was born," Abbie said, 
"I had a twin sister, only she 
died real quick. Maw said I was 
stronger and just crowded the 
life right out of her. When I was 
bad, Maw used to shake her 
head and say Libby'd never have 
been mean or cross or naughty. So 
when something happened, . I 
started saying Libby done it. It 
didn't stop a licking, but it made 
me feel better." 

What a thing to tell a child! 
Matt thought. 

"Purty soon I got to believing 
it, that Libby done the bad things 
that I got licked for, that Libby 
was part of me that I had to push 
deep down so she couldn't get 
out and get me in trouble. After 
I" — she blushed — "got older and 
funny things started happening, 
Libby come in real handy." 

"Can you see her?" Matt ventured. 

"Course not," Abbie said reproachfully. "She ain't real." 
"Isn't." 

« 

19 



"Isn't real, Abbie said. "Things 
happen when I feel bad. I can't 
do anything about it. But you got 
to explain it somehow ... I use 
Libby." 

Matt sighed. Abbie wasn't so 
crazy — or stupid either. "You 
can't contrdl it — ever?" 

"Well, maybe a little. Like 
when I felt kind of mean about 
that liquor you gave Paw, and I 
thought how nice it would be if 
Paw had something wet on the 
outside for a change." 

"How about a tire and a hub 
cap full of nuts?" 

She laughed. Again that tinkling of little silver bells. "You 
did look funny." 

Matt frowned. But slowly his 
expression cleared and he began 
to chuckle. "I guess I did." 

TTE swung back to the typewriter before he realized that 
he was accepting the events of 
the last eighteen hours as physical 
facts and Abbie's explanation as 
theoretically possible. Did he 
actually believe that Abbie could 
— how was he going to express 
it? — move objects with some mysterious, intangible force? By wishing? Of course he didn't, He 
stared at the typewriter. Or did 
he? 

He called up a picture of a pint 
bottle hanging unsupported in 
mid air, emptying its contents 
over Jenkins's head. He remem


20 G 



bered a dish that jumped from a 
shelf to shatter on the floor. He 
thought of a hub cap that dumped 
its contents into the dirt when 
his foot was two inches away. 
And he saw a tire straighten up 
and begin to roll down a level 
road. 

You can't just dismiss things, 
he thought. In any comprehensive scheme of the universe, you 
must include all valid phenomena. If the accepted scheme of 
things cannot find a place for it, 
then the scheme must change. 

Matt shivered. It was a disturbing thought. 

The primitive mind believed 
that inanimate objects had spirits 
that must be propitiated. With a 
little sophistication came mythology and its personification — 
nymphs and sprites, Poseidon and 
Aeolus — and folklore, with its 
kobolds and poltergeists. 

Sir James Frazer said something about the relationship between science and magic. Man, he 
said, associates ideas by similarity and by contiguity in space or 
time. If the association is legitimate, it is science; if illegitimate, 
it is magic, science's bastard sister. 

But if the associations of magic 
are legitimate, then those of science must be illegitimate, and the 
two reverse their roles and the 
modern world is standing on its 
head. 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Matt felt a little dizzy. 

Suppose the primitive mind is 
wiser than we are. Suppose you 
can insure good luck by the proper ritual or kill your enemy by 
sticking a pin in a wax doll. Suppose you can prove it. 

You had to have some kind of 
explanation of unnatural events, 
the square pegs that do not fit 
into any of science's round holes. 
Even Abbie recognized that. 

Matt knew what the scientific 
explanation would be: illusion, 
delusion, hypnosis, anything 
which demanded the least possible rearrangement of accepted 
theory, anything which, in effect, 
denied the existence of the phenomenon. 

"OUT how could you really explain it? How could you explain Abbie? Did you^ believe in 
the spirits of inanimate objects, 
directed by Abbie when she was 
in the proper mood? Did you be' 
lieve in poltergeists which Abbie 
ordered about? Did you believe 
in Libby, the intangible projectable, manipulative external soul? 

You had to explain Abbie or 
your cosmology was worthless. 

That man at Duke — Rhine, 
the parapsychologist — he had a 
word for it. Telekinesis. That was 
one attempt to incorporate psychic phenomena into the body 
of science, or, perhaps, to alter 
the theoretical universe in order 



to fit those phenomena into it. 

But it didn't explain anything. 

Then Matt thought of electricity. You don't have to explain 
something in order to use it. You 
don't have to understand it in 
order to control it. It helps, but 
it isn't essential. Understanding 
is a psychological necessity, not 
a physical one. 

Matt stared at the words he 
had written. The seventeenth 
century. Why was he wasting his 
time? Here was something immediate. He had stumbled on 
something that would set the 
whole world on its ear, or perhaps 
stand it on its feet again. It would 
not molder away, as the thesis 
would in a university library. 

Matt turned around. Abbie was 
sitting at the table, her mending 
finished, staring placidly out the 
open doorway. Matt stood up and 
walked toward her. She turned 
her head to look at him, smiling 
slowly. Matt turned his head, 
searching the room. 

"Kin I get you something?" 
Abbie asked anxiously. 

Matt looked down at her. 
"Here!" he said. He plucked the 
needle from the spool of darning 
thread. He forced it lightly into 
the rough top of the table so that 
the needle stood upright. "Now," 
he said defiantly, "make it move." 

Abbie stared at him. "Why?" 

"I want to see you do it," Matt 
said firmly. "Isn't that enough?" 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



21 



"But I don't want to," Abbie 
objected. "I never wanted to do 
it. It just happened." 

"Try!" 

"No, Mr. Wright," Abbie said 
firmly. "It never brung me nothing but misery. It scared away 
all my fellers and all Paw's 
friends. Folks don't like people 
who can do things like that. I 
don't ever want it to happen 
again." 

"If you want to stay here," 
Matt said flatly, "you'll do as I 
say." 

"Please, Mr. Wright," she begged. "Don't make me do it. It'll 
spoil everything. It's bad enough 
when you can't help it, but it's 
worse when you do it a -purpose 
— something terrible will come 
of it." 

Matt glowered at her. Her 
pleading eyes dropped. She bit 
her lip. She stared at the needle. 
Her smooth, young forehead 
tightened. 

Nothing happened. The needle 
remained upright. 

Abbie took a deep breath. "I 
cain't, Mr. Wright," she wailed. 
"I just cain't do it." 

"Why not?" Matt demanded 
fiercely. "Why can't you do it?" 

"I don't know," Abbie said. 
Automatically her hands began 
to smooth the pants laid across 
her lap. She looked down and 
blushed. "I guess it's 'cause I'm 
happy." 



A FTER a morning of experimentation, Mart's only halfconscious need was still 
unsatisfied. He had offered Abbie 
an innumerable assortment of objects: a spool of thread, a fountain pen cap, a dime, a typewriter 
eraser, a three-by-five note card, 
a piece of folded paper, a bottle 
. . . The last Matt considered a 
stroke of genius. But tip it as he 
would, the bottle, like all the rest 
of the objects, remained stolidly 
unaffected. 

He even got the spare tire out 
of the trunk and leaned it against 
the side of the car. Fifteen minutes later, it was still leaning 
there. 

Finally, frowning darkly, Matt 
took a cup from the shelf and 
put it down on the table. "Here," 
he said. "You're so good at 
smashing dishes, smash this." 

Abbie stared at the cup hopelessly. Her face seemed old and 
haggard. After a moment, her 
body seemed to collapse all at 
once. "I cain't," she moaned. "I 
cain't." 

"Can't!" Matt shouted. "Can't! 
Are you so stupid you can't say 
that? Not 'cain'f — can't!" 

Her large blue eyes lifted to 
Mart's in mute appeal. They began to fill with tears. "I can't," ' 
she said. A sob broke from her 
throat. She put her head down 
on her arms. Her thin shoulders 
began to quiver. 



22 




 




Moodily, Matt stared at her 
back. Was everything that he had 
seen merely an illusion? Or did 
this phenomenon only evidence 
itself under very rigid conditions? 
Did she have to be unhappy? 

It was not without a certain 
logic. Neurotic children had played a large part in the history of 
witchcraft. In one of the English 
trials, children had reportedly 
fallen into fits and vomited crooked pins. They could not pronounce such holy names as 
"Lord," "Jesus," or "Christ," but 
they could readily speak the 
names "Satan" or "Devil." Between the middle of the fifteenth 
century and the middle of the 
sixteenth, 100,000 persons had 
been put to death for witchcraft. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



23 



How many had come to the rack, 
the stake, or the drowning pool, 
through the accusations of children? A child saw a hag at her 
door. The next moment she saw 
a hare run by and the woman 
had disappeared. On no more 
convincing evidence than that, 
the woman was accused of turning herself into a hare by witchcraft. 

Why had the children done it? 
Suggestibility? A desire for attention? 

Whatever the reason, it was 
tainted with abnormality. 

In the field of psychic phenomena as well, the investigations of 
the Society of Psychical Research 
were full of instances in which 
neurotic children or neurotic 
young women played a distinct 
if inexplicable role. 

Did Abbie have to be unhappy? 
Matt's lips twisted. // it was true, 
it was hard on Abbie. 

"Get your things together," 
Matt said harshly. "You're going 
home to your father." 

Abbie stiffened and looked up, 
her face tear-streaked but her 
eyes blazing. "I ain't." 

"You are not," Matt corrected 
sharply. 

"I are not," Abbie said fiercely. 
"I are not. I are not." 

Suddenly the cup was sailing 
toward Matt's head. Instinctively, 
he put out his hand. The cup hit 
it and stuck. Matt looked at it 



dazedly and back at Abbie. Her 
hands were still in her lap. 

YOU did it!" Matt shouted. 
"It's true." 
Abbie looked pleased. "Do I 
have to go back to Paw?" 

Matt thought a moment. "No," 
he said. "Not if you'll help me." 

Abbie's lips tightened. "Ain't — 
isn't once enough, Mr. Wright? 
You know I can do it. Won't you 
leave it alone now? It's unlucky. 
Something awful will happen. I 
got a feeling." She looked up at 
his implacable face. "But I'll do 
it, if you want." 

"It's important," Matt said 
gently. "Now. What did you feel 
just before the cup moved toward 
me?" 
"Mad." 

"No, no. I mean what did you 
feel physically or mentally not 
emotionally." 

Abbie's eyebrows were thick. 
When she knit them, they made 
a straight line across the top of 
her nose. "Gosh, Mr. Wright, I 
cain't — " She looked at him 
quickly. "I can't find the words 
to tell about it. It's like I wanted 
to pick up the nearest thing and 
throw it at you, and then it was 
like I had thrown it. Kind of a 
push from all of me, instead of 
just my hand." 

Matt frowned while he put the 
cup back on the table. "Try to 
feel exactly like that again." 



24 




 



Obediently, Abbie concentrated. Her face worked. Finally she 
sagged back in her chair. "I cai — 
I can't. I just don't feel like it." 

"You're going back to your 
father!" Matt snapped. 

The cup rocked. 

"There!" Matt said quickly. 
"Try it again before you forget!" 

The cup spun around. 

"Again!" 

The cup rose an inch from the 
table and settled down. 

Abbie sighed. "It was just a 
trick, wasn't it, Mr. Wright? You 
aren't really going to send me 
back?" 

"No, but maybe you'll wish I 
had before we're through. You'll 
have to work and practice until 
you have full conscious control 
of whatever it is." 

"All right," Abbie said submissively. "But it's terrible tiring 
work when you don't feel like it." 

"Terribly," Matt corrected. 

"Terribly," Abbie repeated. 

"Now," Matt said. "Try it 
again." 

k BBIE practiced until noon. 

Her maximum effort was to 
raise the cup a foot from the 
table, but that she could do very 
well. 

"Where does the energy come 
from?" Matt asked. 

"I don't know," Abbie sighed, 
"but I'm powerful hungry." 

"Very," Matt said. 



"Very hungry," Abbie repeated. 
She got up and walked to the 
cupboard. "How many ham sandwiches do you want — two?" 

Matt nodded absently. When 
the sandwiches came, he ate in 
thoughtful silence. 

It was true, then. Abbie could 
do it, but she had to be unhappy 
to have full power and control. 

"Try it on the mustard," he 
said. 

"I'm so full," Abbie explained 
contentedly. She had eaten three 
sandwiches. 

Matt stared at the yellow jar, 
unseeing. It was quite a problem. 
There was no sure way of determining just what Abbie's powers 
were, without getting some equipment. He had to find out just 
what it was she did, and what 
effect it had on her, before he 
could expect to fully evaluate any 
data. 

But that wasn't the hardest 
part of it. He should be able to 
pick up the things he needed in 
Springfield. It was what he was 
going to have to do to Abbie that 
troubled him. 

All he had been able to find out 
about Abbie's phenomena was 
that they seemed to occur with 
the greatest frequency and 
strength when the girl was unhappy. 

Matt stared out through the 
cabin window. 

Gradually, he was forming a • 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



25 



plan to make Abbie unhappier 
than she had ever been. 

A LL afternoon Matt was very 
kind to Abbie. He helped her 
dry the dishes, although she protested vigorously. He talked to 
her about his life and about his 
studies at the University of Kansas. He told her about the thesis 
and how he had to write it to get 
his master's degree in psychology 
and what he wanted to do when 
he was graduated. 

"Psychology," he said, "is only 
an infant science. It isn't really a 
science at all but a metaphysics. 
It's a lot of theorizing from in-* 
sufficient data. The only way you 
can get data is by experimentation, and you can't experiment 
because psychology is people, living people. Science is a ruthless 
business of observation and setting up theories and then knocking them down in laboratories. 
Physicists can destroy everything 
from atoms to whole islands; biologists can destroy animals; anatomists can dissect cadavers. But 
psychologists have no true laboratories; they can't be ruthless because public opinion won't stand 
for it, and cadavers aren't much 
good. Psychology will never be 
a true science until it has its laboratories where it can be just as 
ruthless as the physical sciences. 
It has to come." 

Matt stopped. Abbie was a 



good listener; he had forgotten 
he was talking to a hill girl. 

"Tell me more about K.U.," 
she sighed. 

He tried to answer her questions about what the coeds wore 
when they went to classes and 
when they had dates and when 
they went to dances. Her eyes 
grew large and round. 

"Guess it would be romantic," 
Abbie sighed. "How far do they 
let a fellow go if they ain't — 
aren't serious?" 

Matt thought Abbie's attempt 
to improve her English was 
touching — almost pathetic. He 
puzzled about her question for a 
moment. "I guess it depends on 
the girl." 

Abbie nodded understandingly. 
"Why do they go to college?" 

"To get married," Matt said. 
"Most of them." 

Abbie shook her head. "All 
those pretty clothes. All those 
men. They must be awful — very 
slow not to get married quick. 
Can't they get married at home 
without waiting so long?" 

Matt frowned perplexedly! Abbie had a talent for asking questions which reached down to basic 
social relationships. "The men 
they meet at college will make 
more money for them." 

"Oh," Abbie said. She shrugged. "That's all right, I guess, if 
that's what you want." 

So it went. Matt paid Abbie 



26 




 



little compliments on her appearance, and she blushed and looked 
pleased. He told her he couldn't 
understand why she wasn't besieged by suitors and why she 
hadn't been married long ago. 
She blushed deeper. He bragged 
expansively on the supper she 
cooked and swore that he had 
never tasted better. 

A BBIE couldn't have been happier. She hummed through 
her tasks. Everything worked well 
for her. The dishes were done 
almost as soon as they were 
started. 

Matt walked out on the porch. 
He sat down on the edge. Abbie 
settled herself beside him, quietly, 
not touching him, her hands in 
her lap. 

The cabin was built on the top 
of a ridge. It was night, but the 
moon had come up big and yellow, and they could look far out 
over the valley. Silvery, in a dark 
green setting of trees, the lake 
glimmered far below. 

"Ain't — isn't it purty," Abbie 
sighed, folding her hands. 

"Pretty," Matt said absently. 

"Pretty," Abbie sighed. 

They sat in silence. Matt sensed her nearness in a way that was 
almost physical. It stirred him. 
There was something intensely 
feminine about Abbie that was 
very appealing at times, in spite 
of her plain face and shapeless 



clothes and bare feet and lack 
of education. Even her singleminded ambition was a striving 
to fulfill her true, her basic function. In a way it was more vital 
and understandable than all the 
confused sublimations of the girls 
he had known. 

Abbie, at least, knew what she 
wanted and what she would pay 
to get it. She would make someone a good wife. Her one goal 
would be to make her husband 
happy. She would cook and clean 
for him and bear his strong, 
healthy children with a great and 
thrilling joy. She would be silent 
when he was silent, unobtrusive 
when he was working, merry 
when he was gay, infinitely responsive when he was passionate. 
And the transcendent wonder of 
it was that she would be fulfilling 
her finest function in doing it; she 
would be serenely happy, blissfully content. 

Matt lit a cigarette in an attempt to break the mood. He 
glanced at her face by the light of 
the match. "What is courting like 
here in the hills?" he asked. 

"Sometimes we walk," Abbie 
said dreamily, "and look at things 
together, and talk a little. Sometimes there's a dance at the school 
house. If a fellow has a boat, you 
can go out on the lake. There's 
huskin' bees an' church socials 
an' picnics. But mostly when the 
moon is a-shinin' an' the night is 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



27 



warm, we just sit on a porch an' 
hold hands and do whatever the 
girl's willin' to allow." 

Matt reached out and took one 
of her hands and held it in his. 
It was cool and dry and strong. 
It clung to his hand. 

She turned her face to him, her 
eyes searching for his face in the 
darkness. "Do you like me a little 
bit, Mr. Wright?" she asked softly. "Not marryin'-like, but friendly-like?" 

"I think that you're the most 
feminine girl I've ever met," he 
said, and realized it was true. 

Almost without volition on 
either part, they seemed to lean 
together, blending in the night. 
Matt's lips sought her pale little 
girl lips and found them, and they 
weren't pale or little girlish at all, 
but warm and soft and passionate. Matt felt her lips part. He 
broke away, breathing quickly. 

Abbie half turned to nestle 
against his shoulder, his arm held 
tightly around her. She sighed 
contentedly. "I reckon I wouldn't 
be unwillin'," she said tremulously, "whatever you wanted to 
do." 

"I can't understand whv you 
didn't get married long ago," he 
said. 

"T guess it was me," Abbie said 
•■• reflectively. "I wasn't rightly satisfied with any of my fellows. I'd get mad at them for no 



reason at all, and then something 
bad would happen to them and 
pretty soon no one would come 
courtin'. Maybe I expected them 
to be what they weren't. I guess 
I wasn't really in love with any of 
them. Anyways, I'm glad I didn't 
get married up." She sighed. 

Matt felt the stirrings of something that felt oddly like compunction. What a louse you are, 
Matthew Wright! 

"What happened to them — 
your fellows?" he asked. "Was it 
something you did?" 

"Folks said it was," Abbie said. 
There was a trace of bitterness 
in her voice. "They said I had the 
evil eye. I don't see how. There 
isn't anything wrong with my 
eyes, is there?" She looked up at 
him ; her eyes were large and dark 
blue, with little flecks of silvery 
moonlight in them. 

"Not a thing," Matt said. 
"They're very beautiful." 

"I don't see how it could have 
been any of my fault," Abbie said. 
"Of course, when Hank was late 
that evening, I told him he was 
so slow he might as well have a 
broken leg. Right after that he 
was . nailing shingles on a roof, 
and he fell off and broke his leg. 
But I reckon he'd have broke it 
anyways. He was always right 
careless. 

"And then Gene, he was so cold 
I told him he should fall in the 
lake and warm up. But a person 



28 




 



who does a lot of fishin', I guess 
he falls in a lot anyways." 

"I guess so," Matt said. He 
began to shiver. ■ 

"You're shivering, Mr. Wright," 
Abbie said solicitously. "Let me 
go get your jacket." 

"Never mind," Matt said. "It's 
about time for bed anyway. You 
go in and get ready. Tomorrow — 
tomorrow we're going to drive 
( to Springfield for some shopping." 

"Really, Mr. Wright? I haven't 
never been to Springfield," Abbie 
said incredulously. She got up, 
her eyes shining. "Really?" 

"Really," Matt said. "Go on in, 
now." 

She went in. She was almost 
dancing. 

Matt sat on the porch for a 
few minutes longer, thinking. It 
was funny what happened to the 
fellows that disappointed Abbie. 
When he lit a cigarette, his hand 
was shaking. 

Abbie had a way of being many 
different persons. Already Matt 
had known four of them: the 
moody little girl with braids down 
her back shuffling along a dusty 
road or bouncing gleefully on a 
car seat; the happy, placid housewife with cheeks rosy from the 
stove; the unhappy vessel of 
strange powers, tearful and reluctant; the girl with the passionate lips in the moon-streaked 
darkness. Which one was Abbie, 
the true Abbie? 



fT^HE next morning Matt had a 
fifth Abbie to consider. Her 
face was scrubbed and shining 
until it almost rivaled her eyes. 
Her braided hair was wound in a 
coronet around her head. She was 
wearing a different dress made of 
a shiny blue quilted material with 
a red lining. Matt scanned his 
small knowledge of dress materials. Taffeta? The color did terrible things to her hair. The dress 
had a V-shape neck and back and 
fitted better than anything she 
had worn yet. On one hip was a 
large artificial rose. Her stockingless feet were enclosed in a 
pair of black, patent-leather 
sandals. 

My God! Matt thought. Her 
Sunday best! I'll have to walk 
with that down the streets of 
Springfield. He shuddered, and 
resisted the impulse to tear off 
that horrible rose. 

"Well," he said, "all ready?" 

Abbie blushed excitedly. "Are 
we really going to Springfield, Mr. 
- Wright?" 

"We are if the car will start." 

"Oh, it'll start," Abbie said 
confidently. 

Matt gave her a thoughtful 
sidelong glance. That was another 
thing. 

After the usual hearty breakfast, with fried potatoes on the 
side, they got into the car. The 
brakes released without hesitation. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



29 



The drive was more than fifty 
miles, half of it over dirt roads 
that were roller-coaster washboards, and they drove it in silence. Every few miles Matt 
would glance at Abbie out of the 
corner of his eye and shudder. 
As excited as she was, like a child, 
Abbie was contented to sit quietly 
and enjoy the ride, particularly 
when they swung off the dirt road 
onto Highway 665. 

When they came into Springfield, Abbie's face was glowing. 
She stared at the buildings as if 
they had sprung magically into 
being especially for her. Then 
she began to inspect the people 
walking along the streets. Matt 
noticed that it was the women 
who received her closest attention. 

Suddenly Matt noticed that 
Abbie was very quiet. He glanced 
toward her. She was still, staring 
down at her hands resting in her 
lap. 

"What's the matter?" Matt 
asked. 

"I guess," she said, her voice a 
little unsteady, "I guess I look 
pretty funny. I guess you'll feel 
ashamed having me along. If it's 
all right with you, Mr. Wright, 
I'll just sit in the car." 

"Nonsense," Matt said heartily. 
"You look fine." The little devil, 
he thought. She has an uncanny 
talent for understanding things. 
She's either unusually perceptive 



or — What? "Besides, I'll need 
you to try on some clothes." 

"Clothes, Mr. Wright!" she exclaimed. She seemed to find it 
hard to speak. "You're going to 
buy some clothes." 

Matt nodded. He parked the 
car in front of Springfield's biggest department store. He came 
around to Abbie's door and helped her out. For a moment Abbie's 
face was level with his; her blue % 
eyes locked with his dark ones in 
a look that Matt refused to analyze. They walked into the store, 
Abbie clinging to his arm. He 
could feel her heart beating swiftly. Matt stopped a moment to 
study the directory. 

"Second floor," he said. 

Abbie held back as Matt started off. "Kin we — can we look 
around here — for just a second?" 
Abbie asked hesitantly. 

Matt glanced at her and shrugged. "I suppose so." 

A BBIE started off determinedly 
toward some mysterious, unseen destination, leading Matt 
down innumerable aisles. All the 
way to the back of the store they 
went, and emerged miraculously 
into the kitchen ware department. 
Abbie stopped on the threshhold, 
gazing rapturously at the gleaming pots and pans, beaters, knives, 
and gadgets, as if they were 
jewels. She dismissed with a 
glance the stoves and electrical 



30 




 



appliances, but the cooking utensils brought forth long sighs. 
After a moment she moved 
among them, staring at them, 
touching them with one timid finger. She made little crooning 
sounds deep in her throat. 

Matt had to drag her away. 

They were almost to the stairs 
when Matt noticed that she was 
1 olding something to her breast. 
He stopped. He stared aghast. 
She was hugging a tiny frying 
pan of shiny aluminum and dully 
gleaming copper. 

"Where did you get that?" he 
demanded. 

"Back there," she said innocently. "They got so many. 
They'll never miss a little thing 
like this." 

"But you can't do that!" Matt 
said. "That's stealing." 

" 'Tain't stealing when they got 
so much and I got so little," she 
explained. 

"You've got to take it- back!" 
Matt made a futile grab for the 
frying pan. Abbie hugged it to 
her breast with both arms. 

"Don't take it away from me!" 
she wailed. "Please don't make 
me take it back!" 

Matt glanced around nervously. So far no one seemed to be 
watching them. He turned back 
to Abbie. "Sh-h-h!" he said. "Be 
quiet now. Please be quiet." He 
looked at her pleadingly. She 
hugged the frying pan tighter. 



"All right," he sighed. "Stay here! 
Don't move! Don't say anything!" 

QUICKLY he walked back to 
kitchenwares. He caught the 
attention of the clerk. "How 
much are those," he said, pointing 
to the frying pans. 

"Four-fifty, sir. Shall I wrap 
one up?" 
"Four-fifty!" 

"Yes, sir," the man said. "We 
have some cheaper ones in all 
aluminum — " 

"Never mind," Matt said hurriedly. He pulled out his billfold. 
"Here. Give me a receipt and a 
sack." 

The clerk picked up a frying 
pan. 

"No, no," Matt said. "I don't 
want one. I just want a receipt 
and a sack." 

"But, sir," the man said bewilderedly. "You said — " 

"Don't argue with me," Matt 
said. "Just give me a receipt and 
a sack!" 

The clerk rang up the sale, tore 
off the receipt, dropped it in a 
sack, and handed it to Matt with 
a very dazed expression on his 
face. 

"Anything else, sir?" he asked 
automatically. 

"I hope not," said Matt, and 
hurried away. When he looked 
back the clerk was still staring 
after him. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



31 



A BBIE was standing by the 
stairs where he had left her. 
"Put the frying pan in here," 
he whispered. 

She gave him a look of admiration. "Oh, that was real clever of 
you." 

Matt mopped his forehead. 
"Yes, wasn't it." He took her arm 
and hurried her up the stairs. At 
the top Matt came to a halt and 
looked around. Abbie stared with 
big eyes at the racks upon racks 
of dresses. 

"I never knew," she whispered, 
"there was so many dresses in the 
world." 

Matt nodded absently. He. had 
to get away long enough to find a 
laboratory from which to rent 
some testing apparatus. 

He saw a saleswoman, and 
drew her aside. 

"The girl" over there," he said. 
"I want you to take her to the 
beauty parlor and give her the 
works. Haircut, shampoo, setting, 
facial, eyebrows thinned and 
shaped and a makeup job. Then 
get her a new outfit from the skin 
out. Can you do all that?" 

The saleswoman looked quite 
pleased. "We'll be very happy to 
help you." 

Matt took out his billfold and 
peered into it. Slowly he extracted 
one traveler's check for one hundred dollars and then another. 
It left him only three hundred 
dollars, and he still had to get 



the equipment and live for the 
rest of the summer. Matt sighed 
and countersigned the checks. 
"Try to keep it under this," he 
said heavily. "If you can." 

"Yes, sir," said the saleswoman 
and hesitated, smiling. "Your 
fiancee?" 

"Good God, no," Matt blurted 
out. "I mean — she's my — niece. 
It's her birthday." 

He walked over to Abbie, 
breathing heavily. "Go with this 
woman, Abbie, and do what she 
tells you." 

"Yes, Mr. Wright," Abbie said 
dazedly. And she walked away 
as if she were entering into fairyland. 

Matt turned, biting his lip. He 
felt slightly sick. 

TIE had one more thing to do 
before he could leave the 
store. Making sure Abbie was 
gone, he went into the lingerie 
department. He regretted it almost immediately. Once he had 
seen a woman come into a pool 
hall; he must, he thought, wear 
the same sheepish, out-of-place 
expression. 

He swallowed his qualms — 
they were a hard lump in his 
throat — and walked up to the 
counter. 

"Yes, sir," said the young woman brightly, "what can I do for 
you?" 

Matt avoided looking at her. 



32 




 



"I'd like to buy a negligee," he 
said in a low voice. 
"What size?" 

Matt began a motion with his 
hands and then dropped them 
hastily at his sides. "About five 
feet tall. Slim." 

The woman led him along the 
counter. "Any particular color?" 

"Uh — black," Matt said 
hoarsely. 

The clerk brought out a garment that was very black, very 
lacy, very sheer. "This is thirtynine ninety-eight." 

Matt stared at it. "That's awfully black," he said. 

"We have some others," the 
clerk began, folding the negligee. 

"Never mind," Matt said 
quickly. "Wrap it up." Furtively, 
he slipped the money over the 
counter. 

When he came out, the package under his arm, he was sweating freely. 

He put the box in his car and 
looked at his watch. He had 
about two and a half hours, at 
least. He should be able to find 
everything he needed in that time. 

He pulled a list of things out 
of his pocket, and found a telephone directory in a drugstore. 

OPRINGFIELD had a labora^ tory supply house. He called 
the number, asked for the equipment he'd need, was told they 
had it for rent, and drove over'to 



pick it up. The rental didn't seem 
like much by the day, but it was, 
he discovered on figuring it out, 
a lot by the month — enough to 
break him fast if he didn't get 
something like a controlled series 
of tests, very fast. 

Feeling like a child-slayer, he 
drove back to the department 
store and parked. 

Only one hour had gone by. 
He went into the store and browsed about. 

Two hours. He put another 
nickel in the parking meter. He 
sat down in a red leather chair 
and tried to look as if he were 
testing it for size and comfort. 

Three hours. He fed the parking meter again, and began to 
feel hungry. He went back to the 
chair. From it, he could keep an 
eye on the stairs. 

Women went up and came 
down. None of them were Abbie. 
He wondered, with a flash of fear, 
if she had been caught trying to 
make off with something else. 

Matt tried not watching the 
stairs on the theory that a watched pot never boils. Never again, 
he vowed, would he go shopping 
with a woman. Where the devil 
was Abbie? 

"Mr. Wright." The voice was 
tremulous and low. 

Matt looked up and leaped out 
of his chair. The girl standing 
beside him was blond and breathtaking. The hair was short and 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



33 



fluffed out at the ends; it framed 
a beautiful face. A soft, simple 
black dress with a low neckline 
clung to a small but womanly 
figure. Slim, long legs in sheer 
stockings and. small black shoes 
with towering heels. 

"Good God, Abbie! What have 
they done to you?" 

"Don't you like it?" Abbie 
asked. The lovely face clouded 
up. 

"It's — it's marvelous," Matt 
spluttered. "But they bleached 
your hair!" 

Abbie beamed. "The woman 
who worked on it called it a 
rinse. She said it was natural, but 
I should wash it every few days. 
Not with laundry soap, either." 
She sighed. "I didn't know there 
was so much a girl could do to 
her face. I've got so much to 
learn. Why, she — " 

Abbie prattled on happily while 
Matt stared at her, incredulous. 
Had he been sleeping in the same 
small cabin with this girl? Had 
she been cooking his meals and 
darning the holes in his pockets? 
Had he really kissed her and held 
her in his arms and heard her 
say. "I reckon I wouldn't be unwillin' — " 

He wondered if he would act 
the same again. 

1%/JATT had expected a difference but not such a startling 
one. She wore her clothes with a 



becoming sureness. She walked 
on the high heels as if she had 
worn them all her life. She carried herself as if she was born to 
beauty. But then, things always 
worked well for Abbie. 

Abbie opened a small black 
purse and took out five dollars 
and twenty-one cents. "The woman said I should give this back 
to you." 

Matt took it and looked at it 
in his hand and back at Abbie. 
He shrugged and smiled. "The 
power of money. Have you got 
everything?" 

Under her arm she carried a 
large package that contained, no 
doubt, the clothes and shoes she 
had worn. Matt took it from her. 
She refused to give up the package that held the frying pan. 

"I couldn't wear this," she said. 
She reached into her purse and 
pulled out something black and 
filmy. She held it up by one 
strap. "It was uncomfortable." 

Matt shot nervous glances to 
the right and the left. "Put it 
away." He crammed it back into 
the purse and snapped the purse 
shut. "Are you hungry?" 

"I could eat a hog," Abbie said. 

Coming from this blonde creature, the incongruity set Matt to 
laughing. Abbie stared with wide 
eyes. "Did I say something 
wrong?" she asked plaintively. 

v "No." Matt got out and led her 
toward the door. 



34 




 



"You got to tell me," Abbie 
said appealingly. "There's so 
much I don't know." 

Matt located the most expensive restaurant in town. It had a 
romantic atmosphere but he had 
chosen it because it specialized in 
sea food. He wanted to be sure 
that Abbie had things to eat she 

had never tasted before. 

i 

Matt ordered for both of them : 
shrimp cocktail, assorted relishes, chef's salad with roquefort 
dressing, broiled lobster tails with 
drawn butter, french fried potatoes, broccoli with a cheese 
sauce, frozen eclair, coffee. The 
food was good, and Abbie ate 
everything with great wonderment, as if it were about to disappear into the mysterious place 
from which it came. 

She stared wide-eyed at the 
room and its decorations and the 
other diners and the waiter, and 
seemed oblivious of the fact that 
other men were staring admiringly at her. The waiter puzzled her. 
"Is this all he does?" she asked 
timidly. Matt nodded. "He's very 
good at it," Abbie conceded. 

"Try to move the coffee cup," 
Matt said when they finished. 

Abbie stared at it for a moment. 
"I can't," she said softly. "I tried 
awful — very hard, but I can't. 
I'd do anything you wanted, Mr. 
Wright, but I can't do that." 

Matt smiled. "That's all right. 
I just wanted to see if you could." 



"R/I'ATT found a place tfley 
could dance. He ordered a 
couple of drinks. Abbie sipped 
hers once, made a face, and 
wouldn't touch it again. 

She danced lightly and gracefully in her high-heeled shoes. 
They brought the top of her head 
level with his lips. She rested her 
head blissfully against his shoulder and pressed herself very close. 
For a moment Matt relaxed and 
let himself enjoy the pleasures of 
the aftermath of a good meal and 
a beautiful girl in his arms. But 
Abbie seemed to be in a private 
Eden of her own, as if she had 
entered a paradise and was afraid 
to speak for fear the spell would 
break. 

During the long drive home, 
she spoke only once. "Do people 
live like that all the time?" 

"No," Matt said. "Not always. 
Not unless they have a lot of 
money." 

Abbie nodded. "That's the way 
it should be," she said softly. "It 
should only happen a long ways 
apart." 

When they reached the cabin, 
Matt reached into the back seat 
for the package he had bought. 

"What's that?" Abbie asked. 

"Open it," Matt said. 

She held it up a little, lacy and 
black in the moonlight. Then she 
turned to look at Matt, her face 
transparent, her eyes glowing. 
"Wait out here a minute, will 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



35 



you?" she asked breathlessly. 

"All right." Matt lit a cigarette 
and stood on the porch looking 
out over the valley, hating himself. 

After a few minutes, he heard 
a little whisper. "Come in, Mr. 
Wright." 

TTE opened the door started in 
and stopped, stunned. One 
kerosene lamp lit the room dimly. 
The new clothes were draped 
carefully over the edge of a chair. 
Abbie was wearing the negligee. 
That was all. Through its lacy 
♦ blackness she gleamed pink and 
white, a lovely vision of seductiveness. She stood by the table, 
staring at the floorr When she 
looked up, her cheeks were 
flushed. 

Suddenly she ran lightly across 
the floor and threw her arms 
around Mart's neck and kissed 
him hard on the lips. Her lips 
moved. She drew back a little, 
looking up at him. 

"There's only one way a girl 
like me can thank a man for a 
day as wonderful as this," she 
whispered. "For the clothes and 
the trip and the dinner and the 
dancing. And for being so nice. 
I never thought anything like this 
would ever happen to me. I don't 
mind. I guess it isn't bad when 
you really like someone. I like 
you awful — very well. I'm glad 
they made me pretty. If I can 



make you happy — just for a 
moment — " 

Gently, feeling sick, Matt took 
her hands from around his neck. 
"You don't understand," he said 
coldly. "I've done a terrible thing. 
I don't know how you can ever 
forgive me. Somehow you misunderstood me. Those clothes, the 
negligee — they're for another 
girl — the girl I'm going to marry 
— my fiancee. You're about her 
size and I thought — I don't 
know how I could have misled . . ." 

He stopped. It was enough. His 
plan had worked. Abbie had 
crumpled. Slowly, as he spoke, 
the life had drained out of her, 
the glow had fled from her face, 
and she seemed to shrink in upon 
herself, cold and broken. She was 
a little girl, slapped across the 
face in her most spiritual moment 
by the one person she had trusted 
most. 

"That's all right," she said 
faintly. "Thanks for letting me 
think they was mine — that it 
was for me — only for a little. 
I'll never forget." 

She turned and went to the 
bunk and let the blanket fall 
back around her. 

It was the sobbing that kept 
Matt from going to sleep that 
night. Or maybe it was the way 
the sobs were so soft and muffled 
that he had to strain to hear 
them.

"DREAKFAST was a miserable 
meal. There was something 
wrong with the food, although 
Matt couldn't quite pin down 
what it was. Everything was 
cooked just the same, but the 
flavor was gone. Matt cut and 
chewed mechanically and tried 
to avoid looking at Abbie. It 
wasn't difficult; she seemed very 
small today, and she kept her 
eyes on the floor. 

She was dressed in the shapeless blue gingham once more. She 
toyed listlessly with her food. Her 
face was scrubbed free of makeup, and everything about her was 
dull. Even her newly blonde hair 
had faded. 

Several times Matt opened his 
mouth to apologize again, and 
shut it without saying anything. 
Finally he cleared his throat and 
said, "Where's your new frying 
pan?" 

She looked up for the first time. 
Her blue eyes were cloudy. "I 
put it away," she said lifelessly, 
"do you want it back?" 

"No, no," Matt said hurriedly. 
"I was just asking." 

Silence fell again, like a sodden 
blanket. Matt sat and chainsmoked while Abbie cleaned up 
the table and washed the dishes. 

When she finished she turned 
around with her back to the dishpan. "Do you want me to move 
things for you? I can do it real 
good today." 



Matt saw the little pile of packages in the corner and noticed 
for the first time that the new 
clothes were gone. He steeled 
himself. "How do you know?" 

"I got a feeling." 

"Do you mind?" 

"I don't mind. I don't mind 
anything." She came forward and 
sat down in the chair. "Look!" 

The table between them lifted, 
twisted, tilted on one leg, and 
crashed on its side to the floor. 

"How did you feel?" Matt said 
excitedly. "Can you control the 
power? Was the movement accidental?" 

"It felt like it was kind of a 
part of me," Abbie said. "Like 
my hand. But I didn't know exactly what it was going to do." 

"Wait a minute," Matt said. 
"I'm going to get some things out 
of the car. Maybe we can learn a 
little more about what makes you 
able to do things like this. You 
don't mind, do you?" 

"What's the good of it?" she 
asked listlessly. 

Matt dashed out to the car and 
pulled the two cartons of equipment out of the trunk. He carried 
them into the shack and laid the 
apparatus out on the table. He 
went back to the car and brought 
in the bathroom scales he'd 
bought in the drugstore in Springfield. 

"All right, Abbie. First, let's 
find out a few things about you 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



37 



before we try moving anything 
else." 

Abbie complied automatically 
while he took her temperature 
and pulse, measured her blood 
pressure and weighed her. "I wish 
I could set up controls to measure 
your basal metabolism," he muttered as he worked, "but this will 
have to do. I wish this shack had 
a generator." 

"I could get you electricity," 
Abbie said without much interest. 

"Hmmm — you could at that, 
I guess. But that would make 
these tests meaningless, if you 
had to devote energy to keeping 
the equipment running." 

TTE cursed the limited knowledge that was undoubtedly 
making him miss things that a 
man who had studied longer 
would have know more about. 

But there wasn't anything he 
could do about that. Once he'd 
reached some preliminary conclusions, more experienced researchers could take over the job. 

Working carefully, he wrote 
down the results. 

"Now, Abbie, would you please 
pick that chair up off the floor, 
and hold it up for a few minutes? 
No — I mean really go over and 
pick it up." 

He let her hold it for exactly 
five minutes, then ran her through 
the same tests as before, noting 
the changes in temperature, blood 



pressure, pulse rate, respiration, 
and then he weighed her again. 

"All right. Take a rest now. 
We'll have to wait until these 
readings drop down to what they 
were before we do anything else," 
Matt said. 

Still not displaying anything 
more than acquiescence, Abbie 
sat down in another chair and 
stared at the floor. 

"Abbie, do you mind helping 
me?" Matt asked. "It's for your 
benefit, too. If you can control 
these powers all the time, maybe 
the fellows around here will stop 
breaking legs and falling into 
lakes." 

Abbie's dull expression did not 
change. "I don't care," she said. 

Matt sighed. For a moment, he 
considered dropping his experiments and just getting out of 
Abbie's life — packing his thesis 
notes and typewriter in the car 
and driving back to the University. But he couldn't stop now. He 
was too close to the beginnings of 
an answer. 

He checked Abbie again, and 
found that his readings coincided 
with the first set. The short rest 
had dropped her heartbeat and 
respiration back to normal. 

"Let's try all over again," Matt 
said. "Lift that chair to the same 
height you were holding it, 
please." 

The chair jerked upward, hesitantly. "Easy. Just a little more." 



38 




 



It straightened, then moved more 
steadily. "Hold it there." The 
chair hovered motionless in the 
air, maintaining its position. Matt 
waited five minutes. "All right. 
Let it down now, easy. Slow." 
The chair settled gently to the 
floor, like a drifting feather. 

Once more, he checked Abbie. 

Her heartbeat was below what 
it had been. Her blood pressure 
was lower. Her respiration was 
shallow — her breast was barely 
rising to each breath. Her temperature was low — dangerously so, 
for an ordinary human being. 

"How do you feel?" he asked 
apprehensively. If this was what 
always happened, then Abbie was 
in real danger every time she used 
her powers. 

"All right," she said with no 
more than her previous disinterest. Matt frowned, but she was 
showing no signs of discomfort. 

"Are you sure?" he asked. 

"Yes," she said. "You want me 
to try some more?" 

"If you're sure you're not in 
danger. But I want you to stop 
if you feel any pain or if you're 
uncomfortable. Now, lift the table 
just this far . . ." 

HPHEY practiced with the table 
for an hour. At the end of that 
time, Abbie had it under perfect 
control. She could raise it a fraction of an inch or rocket it to the 
ceiling where it would remain, 



legs pointing stiffly toward the 
floor, until she lowered it. She 
balanced it on one leg and set it 
spinning like a top. 

Distance did not seem to diminish Abbie's control or power. 
She could make the table perform equally well from any point 
in the room, from outside the 
cabin, or from a point to which 
she shuffled dispiritedly several 
hundred yards down the road. 

"How do you know where it is 
and what it's doing?" Matt asked 
frowning. 

Abbie shrugged listlessly. "I 
just feel it." 

"With what?" Matt asked. "Do 
you see it? Feel it? Sense it? If 
we could isolate the sense — " 

"It's all of those," Abbie said. 

Matt shook his head in frustration. "You look a little tired. 
You'd better lie down." 

She lay in her bunk, not moving, her face turned to the wall, 
but Matt knew that she wasn't 
asleep. When she didn't get up to 
fix lunch, Matt opened a can of 
soup and tried to get her to eat 
some of it. 

"No, thanks, Mr. Wright," 
Abbie said. "I ain't hungry." 

"I'm not hungry," Matt corrected. 

Abbie didn't respond. In the 
evening she got out of her bunk 
to fix supper, but she didn't eat 
more than a few mouthfuls. After 
she washed the dishes, she went 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



39 



back into her bunk and pulled 
the blanket around it. 

Matt sat up, trying to make 
sense out of his charts. Despite 
their readings, Abbie hadn't reacted dangerously to what should 
have been frightening physiological changes. He could be fairly 
safe in assuming that they always 
accompanied the appearance of 
her parapsychological powers — 
and she had certainly lived 
through those well enough. 

But why was there such a difference in the way she reacted 
when she was happy and when 
she wasn't? The first morning, 
when she had barely been able 
to assume conscious control, she'd 
been ravenously hungry. Today, 
when she had performed feats 
that made the others insignificant 
she was neither hungry nor abnormally exhausted. She was 
tired, yes, but there had been a 
measurable, though slight, expenditure of energy with each action, which, accumulated through 
their numerous experiments, 
could be expected to equal that 
required for an afternoon's normal work. 

What was different? Why, 
when she tried with what amounted to will-power alone, was it 
harder for her to move an object 
telekinetically than it would have 
been to do so physically? Why 
was the reverse true when she 
was unhappy? 



Unless she was tapping a source 
of energy somewhere. 

The thought sounded as though 
there might be something behind 
it. He reached for a blank sheet 
of paper and began jotting down 
ideas. 

Disregarding the first morning's 
experiments, when she was obviously succeeding despite this 
hypothetical force, what source 
of energy could she be contacting? 

Well, what physical laws was 
she violating? Gravity? Inertia? 

Tf[7HEN Abbie was unhappy, 
* ' she could nullify gravity — 
no, not exactly gravity — mass. 
Once she had done that, a process that might not require much 
energy at all, the object rose by 
itself, and, having no mass, could 
be pushed around easily. Somehow, by some unconscious mechanism, she could restore measured 
amounts of mass and — there 
was an idea trying to come to the 
surface of his thinking — of 
course ! The energy created by the 
moving or falling body when 
mass , was restored and gravity 
re-asserted itself was channeled 
into her body. She stopped being 
a chemical engine sustained by 
food burned in the presence of 
oxygen, and became a receiver 
for the power generated by the 
moving bodies. 

Writing quickly, he systemat

ized what he had learned. Obviously, the energy restored when 
the manipulated objects fell or 
swooped back into place couldn't 
quite balance the energy required 
to move them. She did get tired 
— but nowhere near as tired as 
she should have been. If she empathized with her feelings at such 
times, she retained a bare margin 
of control even when happy, but 
she lost the delicate ability to tap 
the energy thus liberated, and had 
to draw on her own body for the 
power. 

Matt grimaced. If that was true 
— and his charts and graph confirmed it, then she could never use 
her powers unless she was miserable. 

And the key to that lay buried 
in the childhood of a little hill 
girl, who probably had been 
scolded and beaten, as hill children were when they were bad. 
In this case 'bad' meaning a little 
girl who could move things without touching them, who had been 
confronted with the example of 
'Libby,' the perfect little girl who 
would, always have minded her 
mother, until she had come to 
associate the use of her powers 
only with unhappiness, with not 
being wanted, with rejection on 
the part of the people whom she 
loved. 

Matt winced. You louse, 
Wright! 

But it was too late to do any


thing about it now. He had to 
go on with what he was doing. 

A BBIE'S appetite wasn't any 
better in the morning. She 
looked tired, too, as if she hadn't 
slept. Matt stared at her for 
a moment thoughtfully, then 
shrugged and put her to work. 

In a few minutes, Abbie could 
duplicate her feats with the table 
of the day before with a control 
that was, if anything, even finer. 
Matt extended his experiment 
to her subjective reactions. 

"Let's isolate the source," he 
said. "Relax. Try to do it with 
the mind alone. Will the table to 
move." 

Matt jotted down notes. At the 
end of half an hour he had the 
following results: 

Mind alone — negative. 

Body alone — negative. 

Emotions alone — negative. 

It was crude and uncertain. It 
would take days or months of 
practice to be able to use the 
mind without a sympathetic tension of the body, or to stop thinking or to wall off an emotion. 
But Matt was fairly sure that the 
telekinetic ability was a complex 
of all three and perhaps some others that he had no way of knowing about, which Abbie couldn't 
describe. But if any of the primary three were inhibited, consciously or unconsciously, Abbie 
could not move a crumb of bread. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



41 



Two of them could be controlled. The third was a product 
of environment and circumstances. Abbie had to be unhappy. 

A muscle twitched in Mart's 
jaw, and he told Abbie to try 
moving more than one object. 
He saw a cup of coffee rise in the 
air, turn a double somersault 
without spilling a drop, and sit 
down gently in the saucer that 
climbed to meet it. Matt stood 
up, picked the cup out of the air, 
drank the coffee, and put the cup 
back. The saucer did not wobble. 

There were limits to Abbie's 
ability. The number of dissimilar 
objects she could manipulate 
seemed to be three, regardless of 
size; she could handle five similar 
objects with ease, and she had 
made six slices of bread do an 
intricate dance in the air. It was 
possible, of course, that she might 
improve with practice. 

"My God!" Matt exclaimed. 
"You could make a fortune as a 
magician." 

"Could I?" Abbie said without 
interest. She pleaded a headache 
and went to bed. Matt said nothing. They had worked for an hour 
and a half. 

Matt lit a cigarette. The latent 
telekinetic power could explain a 
lot of things, poltergeist phenomena, for instance, and in a more 
conscious form, levitation and the 
Indian rope trick and the whole 
gamut of oriental mysticism. 

42 



He spent the rest of the day 
making careful notes of everything Abbie did, the date and 
time, the object and its approximate weight and its movements. 
When he finished, he would have 
a complete case history. Complete except for the vital parts 
which he did not dare put down 
on paper. 

Several times he turned to stare 
at Abbie's still, small form. He 
was only beginning to realize the 
tremendous potentialities locked 
up within her. His awareness had 
an edge of fear. What role was it 
he'd chosen for himself. He had 
been fairy godmother, but that no 
longer. Pygmalion? He felt a 
little like Pandora must have 
felt before she opened the box. 
Or, perhaps, he thought ruefully, 
he was more like Doctor Frankenstein. 

A BBIE did not get up at all 
that day, and she refused to 
eat anything Matt fixed. Next 
morning, when she climbed slovrly from her bunk, his apprehension sharpened. 

She was gaunt, and her face 
had a middle-aged, haggard look. 
Her blond hair was dull and lifeless. Matt had already cooked 
breakfast, but she only went 
through the motions of eating. 
He urged her, but she put her 
fork down tiredly. 

"It don't matter," she said. 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"Maybe you're sick," Matt 
fretted. "We'll take you to a 
doctor." 

Abbie looked at Matt levelly 
and shook her head. "What's 
wrong with me, a doctor won't 
fix." 

That was the morning Matt 
saw a can of baking powder pass 
through his chest. Abbie had been 
tossing it to Matt at various 
speeds, gauging the strength of 
the push necessary. Matt would 
either catch it or Abbie would 
stop it short and bring it back to 
her. But this time it came too 
fast, bullet-like. Involuntarily, 
Matt looked down, tensing his 
body for the impact. 

He saw the can go in . . . 

Abbie's eyes were wide and 
frightened. Matt turned around 
dazedly, prodding his chest with 
trembling fingers. The can had 
shattered against the cabin wall 
behind him. It lay on the floor, 
battered, in a drift of powder. 

"It went in," Matt said. "I 
saw it, but I didn't feel a thing. 
It passed right through me. What 
happened, Abbie?" 

"I couldn't stop it," she whispered, "so I just sort of wishe 1 
it wasn't there. For just a moment. And it wasn't." 

That was how they found out 
that Abbie could teleport. It was 
as simple as telekinesis. She co.'ld 
project or pull objects through 
walls without hurting either one. 



Little things, big things. It made 
no difference. Distance made no 
difference either, apparently. 

"What about living things?" 
Matt asked. 

Abbie concentrated. Suddenly 
there was a mouse on the table, 
a brown field mouse with twitching whiskers and large, startled 
black eyes. For a moment it 
crouched there, frozen, and then 
it scampered for the edge of the 
table, straight toward Abbie. 

Abbie screamed and reacted. 
Twisting in the air, the mouse 
vanished. Matt looked up, his 
mouth hanging open. Abbie was 
three feet in the air, hovering like 
a hummingbird. Slowly she sank 
down to her chair. 

"It works on people, too," 
Matt whispered. "Try it again. 
Try it on me." 

~]%/|~ATT felt nauseated, as if he 
had suddenly stepped off the 
Earth. The room shifted around 
him. He looked down. He was 
floating in the air about two feet 
above the chair he had been sitting on. He was turning slowly, 
so that the room seemed to revolve around him. 

He looked for Abbie, but she 
was behind him now. Slowly she 
drifted into view. "That's fine," 
he said. Abbie looked happier 
than she had looked for days. 
She almost smiled. 

Matt began to turn more rapid


WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



43 



ly. In a moment he was spinning 
like a top; the room flashed into 
a kaleidoscope. He swallowed 
hard. ' "All right," he shouted, 
"that's enough." 

Abruptly he stopped spinning 
and dropped. His stomach soared 
up into his throat. He thumped 
solidly into the chair and immediately hopped up with a howl 
of anguish. He rubbed himself 
with both hands. 

"Ouch!" he shouted. And then 
accusingly, "You did that on 
purpose." 

Abbie looked innocent. "I done 
what you said." 

"All right, you did," Matt said 
bitterly. "From now on, I resign 
as a guinea pig." 

Abbie folded her hands in her 
lap. "What shall I do? 

"Practice on yourself," Matt 
said. 

"Yes, Mr. Wright." She rose 
sedately in the air. "This is wonderful." She stretched out as if 
she were laying in bed. She floated 
around the room. Matt was reminded of shows in which he had 
seen magicians producing the 
same illusion, passing hoops 
cleverly around their assistant's 
body to show that there were no 
wires. Only this wasn't magic; 
this wasn't illusion; this was real. 

Abbie settled back into the 
chair. Her face was glowing. "I 
feel like I could do anything," 
she said. "Now what shall I try." 



Matt thought a moment. "Can 
you project yourself?" 
"Where to?" 

"Oh, anywhere," Matt said impatiently. "It doesn't matter." 

"Anywhere?" she repeated. 
There was a distant and unreadable expression in her eyes. 

And then she vanished. 

Matt stared at the chair she 
had been in. She was gone, indisputably gone. He searched the 
room, a simple process. There was 
no sign of her. He went outside. 
The afternoon sun beat down, 
exposing everything in a harsh 
light. 

"Abbie!" Matt shouted. "Abbie!" He waited. He heard only 
the echo drifting back from the 
hills across the lake. For five 
minutes he roamed about the 
cabin, shouting and calling, before he gave up. 

He went back into the cabin. 
He sat down and stared moodily 
at the bunk where Abbie had / 
slept. Where was she now? Was 
she trapped in some extra dimension, weird and inexplicable to 




WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



the senses, within which her 
power could not work. 

There had to be some such 
explanation for teleportation — 
a fourth dimensional shortcut 
across our three. Why not — if 
she could nullify mass, she could 
adjust atoms so that they entered one of the other dimensions. 

A S he brooded, remorse came 
to him slowly, creeping in so 
stealthily that awareness of it was 
like a blow. The whole scheme 
had been madness. He could not 
understand now the insane ambition that had led to this tinkering with human lives and the 
structure of the Universe. He had 
justified it to himself with the 
name of science. But the word 
had no mystic power of absolution. 

His motive had been something 
entirely different. It was only a 
sublimated lust for power, and 
thinly disguised at that. The 
power, of knowledge. And for 
that lust, which she could never 
understand, an innocent, unsophisticated girl had suffered. 

Was Abbie dead? Perhaps that 
was the most merciful thing. 

Ends can never justify means, 
Matt realized now. They are too 
inextricably intertwined ever to 
be separated. The means inevitably shape the ends. In the long 
view, there are neither means nor 



ends, for the means are only an 
infinite series of ends, and the 
ends are an infinite series of 
means . . . 

And Abbie appeared. Like an 
Arabian genie, with gifts upon a 
tray, streaming a mouth-watering 
incense through the air. Fullformed, she sprang into being, her 
cheeks glowing, her eyes shining. 

"Abbie!" Matt shouted joyfully. His heart gave a sharp 
bound, as if it had suddenly been 
released from an unbearable 
weight. "Where have you been?" 

"Springfield." 

"Springfield!" Matt gasped. 
"But that's over fifty miles." 

Abbie lowered the tray to the 
table. She snapped her fingers. 
"Like that, I was there." 

Matt's eyes fell to the tray. It 
was loaded with cooked food: 
shrimp cocktail, broiled lobster 
tails, french fried . . . 

Abbie smiled. "I got hungry." 

"But where — ?" Matt began. 
"You went back to the restaurant," he said accusingly, "you 
took the food from there." 

Abbie nodded happily. "I was 
hungry." 

"But that's stealing," Matt 
moaned. And he realized for the 
first time the enormity of the 
thing he had done, what he had 
let loose upon the world. Nothing 
was safe. Neither money nor 
jewels nor deadly secrets. Nothing at all. 



46 




 



"They won't ever miss it," Abbie said, "and nobody saw me." 
She said it simply, as the ultimate 
justification. 

Matt was swept by the staggering realization that where her 
basic drives were concerned Abbie 
was completely unmoral. There 
was only one small hope. If he 
could keep her from realizing her 
civilization-shattering potentialities! They might never occur to 
her. 

"Sure," Matt said. "Sure." 

Abbie ate heartily, but Matt 
had no appetite. He sat thoughtfully, watching her eat, and he 
experienced a brief thankfulness 
that at least she wasn't going to 
starve to death. 

"Didn't you have any trouble?" 
he asked. "Getting the food without anyone seeing you?" 

Abbie nodded. "I couldn't decide how to get into the kitchen. 
I could see that the cook was all 
alone . . ." 

"You could see?" 

"I was outside, but I could see 
into the kitchen, somehow. So 
finally, I called 'Albert!' And the 
cook went out and I went in and 
took the food that was sitting on 
the tray and came back here. 
It was really simple, because the 
cook was expecting someone to 
call him." 

"How did you know that?" 

"I thought it," Abbie said, 
frowning. "Like this." 



SHE concentrated for a moment. He watched her, puzzled, and then knew what she 
meant. Panic caught him by the 
throat. There were things she 
shouldn't know. Because he was 
trying so hard to bury them deep, 
they scuttled across his consciousness. 

Telepathy! 

And as he watched her face, he 
knew that he was right. 

Her eyes grew wide and incredulous. Slowly, something 
hard and cruelly cold slipped over 
her face like a mask. 

Oh, Abbie! My sweet, gentle 
Abbie! 

"You — " she gasped. "You 
devil! There ain't nothin' too bad 
for anyone who'd do that!" 

I'm a dead man, Matt thought. 

"You with your kindness and 
your handsome face and your city 
manners," Abbie said pitifully. 
"How could you do it? You made 
me fall in love with you. It wasn't 
hard, was it? All you had to do 
was hold a little hill girl's hand 
in the moonlight an' kiss her 
once, an' she was ready to jump 
into bed with you. But you didn't 
want anything as natural as that. 
All the time you was laughing 
and scheming. Poor little hill girl! 

"You make me think you like 
me so well you want me to look 
real purty in new clothes and new 
hair and a new face. But it's just 
a trick. All the time it's a trick. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



47 



When I'm feeling happiest and 
most grateful, you take it all 
away. I'd sooner you hit me 
across the face. Poor little hill 
girl! Thinking you wanted her. 
Thinking maybe you were aiming 
to marry her. I wanted to die. 
Even Paw was never that mean. 
He never done anything a-purpose, like you." 

White-faced, Matt watched her, 
his mind racing. 

"You're thinking you can get 
around me somehow," Abbie 
said, "and I'll forget. You can 
make me think it was all a mistake. 'Tain't no use. You can't, 
not ever, because I know what 
you're thinking." 

What had he been thinking? 
Had he actually thought of marrying her? Just for a second? He 
shuddered. It would be hell. 
Imagine, if you can, a wife whois all-knowing, all-powerful, who 
can never be evaded, avoided, 
sighed to, lied to, shut out, shut 
up. Imagine a wife who can make 
a room a shambles in a second, 
who can throw dishes and chairs 
and tables with equal facility and 
deadly accuracy. Imagine a wife 
who can be any place, any time, 
in the nicker of a suspicion. 
Imagine a wife who can see 
through walls and read minds 
and maybe wish you a raging 
headache or a broken leg or aching joints. 

It would be worse than hell. 



The torments of the damned 
would be pleasant compared to 
that. 

Abbie's chin came up. "You 
don't need to worry. I'd as soon 
marry up with a rattlesnake. At 
least he gives you warning before 
he strikes." 

"Kill me!" Matt said desperately. "Go ahead and kill me!" 

Abbie smiled sweetly. "Killing's 
too good for you. I don't know 
anything that ain't too good for 
you. But don't worry, I'll think of 
something. Now, go away and 
leave me alone." 

rpHANKFULLY, Matt started 
to turn. Before he could complete it, he found himself outside 
the cabin. He blinked in the light 
of the sinking sun. He began to 
shiver. After a little he sat down 
on the porch and lit a cigarette. 
There had to be some way out of 
this. There was always a way. 

From inside the cabin came the 
sound of running water. Running 
water! Matt resisted an impulse 
to get up and investigate the 
mystery. "Leave me alone," Abbie had said, in a tone that Matt 
didn't care to challenge. 

A few minutes later he heard 
the sound of splashing and Abbie's voice lifted in a sweet soprano. Although he couldn't understand the words, the tune sent 
chills down his back. And then a 
phrase came clear: 



48 




 



Root-a-toot-toot 

Three times she did shoot 

Right through that hardwood 

door. 
He was her man, 
But he done her wrong . . . 

Matt began to shake. He passed 
a trembling hand across his 
sweaty forehead and wondered if 
he had a fever. He tried to pull 
himself together for he had to 
think clearly. The situation was 
obvious. He had done a fiendishly 
cruel thing — no matter what the 
excuse — and he had been caught 
and the power of revenge was in 
the hands of the one he had 
wronged, never more completely. 

The only question was: what 
form would the revenge take? 
When he knew that, he might be 
able to figure out a way to evade 
it. There was no question in his 
mind about waiting meekly for 
justice to strike. 

The insurmountable difficulty 
was that the moment he thought 
of a plan, it would be unworkable because Abbie would be 
forewarned. And she was already 
armed. He had to stop thinking. 

How do you stop thinking? he 
thought miserably. Srop thinking! he told himself. Stop thinking, damn you! 

He might be on the brink of 
the perfect solution. But if he 
thought of it, it would be worthless. And if he couldn't think of 



it, then — 

The circle was complete. He 
was back where he started, staring at its perfect viciousness. 
There was only one possi — 

Mary had a little Iamb with 
fleece as white as snow and everywhere that Mary went (Relax!) 
the lamb (Don't think!) was sure 
(Act on the spur of the moment) 
to go. Mary had a . . . 

"Well, Mr. Wright, are you 
ready to go?" 

Matt started. Beside him were 
a pair of black suede shoes filled 
with small feet. His gaze traveled 
up the lovely, nylon-sheathed 
legs, up the clinging black dress 
that swelled so provocatively, to 
the face with its blue eyes and red 
lips and blond hair. 

Even in his pressing predicament, Matt had to recognize the 
impact of her beauty. It was a 
pity that her other gifts were too 
terrible. 

"I reckon your fiancee won't 
mind," Abbie said sweetly. "Being as you ain't got a fiancee. Are 
you ready?" 

"Ready?" Matt looked down at 
his soiled work clothes. "For 
what?" 

"You're ready," Abbie said. 

A WAVE of dizziness swept 
him, followed by a wave of 
nausea. Matt shut his eyes. They 
receded. When he opened his eyes 
again, he had a frightening sensa

tion of disorientation. Then he 
recognized his surroundings. He 
was on the dance floor in Springfield. 

Abbie came into his arms. "All 
right," she said, "dance!" 

Shocked, Matt began to dance, 
mechanically. He realized that 
people were staring at them as if 
they had dropped through a hole 
in the ceiling. Matt wasn't sure 
they hadn't. Only two other 
couples were on the small floor, 
but they had stopped dancing and 
were looking puzzled. 

As Matt swung Abbie slowly 
around he saw that the sprinkling 
of customers at the bar had 
turned to stare, too. A waiter in a 
white jacket was coming toward 
them, frowning determinedly. 

Abbie seemed as unconcerned 
about the commotion she had 
caused as the rainbow-hued juke 
box in the corner. It thumped 
away just below Matt's conscious 
level of recognition. Abbie danced 
lightly in his arms. 

The waiter tapped Matt on the 
shoulder. Matt sighed with relief 
and stopped dancing. Immediately he found himself moving jerkily around the floor like a puppet. 
Abbie, he gathered, did not care 
to stop. 

The waiter followed doggedly. 
"Stop that!" he said bewilderedly. 
"I don't know where you came 
from or what you think you're 
doing, but you can't do it in here 



and you can't do it dressed like 
that." 

"\ — I c-can-n't s-st-stop-p!" 
Matt said jerkily. 

"Sure you can," the waiter said 
soothingly. He plodded along 
after them. "There's lots of things 
a man can't do, but he can always 
stop whatever you're doing. I 
should think you'd be glad to 
stop." 

"W-w-would," Matt got out. 
"S-st-stop-p!" he whispered to 
Abbie. 

"Tell the man to go 'way," 
Abbie whispered back. 

Matt decided to start dancing 
again. It was easier than being 
shaken to pieces. "I think you'd 
better go away," he said to the 
waiter. 

"We don't like to use force," the 
waiter said, frowning, "but we 
have to keep up a standard for 
our patrons. Come along quietly," 
he jerked on Matt's arm "or — " 

The grip on Matt's arm was 
suddenly gone. The waiter vanished. Matt looked around wildly. 

The juke box had a new decoration. Dazed, opaque-eyed, the 
waiter squatted on top of the 
box, his white jacket and whiter 
face a dark fool's motley in the 
swirling lights. 

Abbie pressed herself close. 
Matt shuddered and swung her 
slowly around the floor. On the 
next turn, he saw that the waiter 
had climbed down from his perch.

He had recruited reinforcements. 
Grim-faced and silent, the waiter 
approached, followed by another 
waiter, a lantern- jawed bartender, 
and an ugly bulldog of a man in 
street clothes. The manager, Matt 
decided. 

They formed a menacing ring 
around Matt and Abbie. 

"Whatever your game is," 
growled the bulldog, "we don't 
want to play. If you don't leave 
damn quick, you're going to wish 
you had." 

Matt, looking at him, believed 
it. He tried to stop. Again his 
limbs began to jerk uncontrollably. 

"I-I c-can-n't," he said. "D-ddon't y-you th-think I-I w-would 
if I-I c-could." 

The manager stared at him 
with large, awed, bloodshot eyes. 
"Yeah," he said. "I guess you 
would." He shook himself. His 
jowls wobbled. "Okay, boys. Let's 
get rid of them." 

"Watch yourself," said the first 
waiter uneasily. "One of them has 
a trick throw." 

They closed in. Matt felt Abbie 
stiffen against him. 

HPHEY vanished, one after the 
other, like candles being 
snuffed. Matt glanced unhappily 
at the juke box. There they were 
on top of the box, stacked in 
each other's laps like a totem 
pole. The pile teetered and col


lapsed in all directions. Dull 
thuds made themselves heard 
even above the juke box. 

Matt saw them get up, puzzled and wary. The bartender 
was rubbing his nose. He doubled 
his fists and started to rush out 
on the floor. The manager, a 
wilier sort, grabbed his arm. The 
four of them went into consultation. Every few seconds one of 
them would raise his head and 
stare at Matt and Abbie. Finally 
the first waiter detached himself 
from the group and with an air of 
finality reached behind the juke 
box. Abruptly the music stopped; 
the colored lights went out. Silence fell. The four of them turned 
triumphantly toward the floor. 

Just as' abruptly, the lights 
went back on; the music boomed 
out again. They jumped. 

Defiantly, the manager stepped 
to the wall and pulled the plug 
from the socket. He turned, still 
holding the cord. It stirred in his 
hand. The manager looked down 
at it incredulously. It wriggled. 
He dropped it hurriedly, with revulsion. The plug rose cobralike 
from its coils and began a slow, 
deadly, weaving dance. The manager stared, hypnotized with disbelief. 

The cord struck. The manager 
leaped back. The bared, metal 
fangs bit into the floor. They 
retreated, all four of them, watching with wide eyes. Contemptu


WHEREVER YOU MAY BE

ously, the cord turned its back 
on them, wriggled its way to the 
socket, and plugged itself in. 

The music returned. Matt 
danced on with leaden legs. He 
could not stop. He would never 
stop. He thought of the fairy tale 
of the red shoes. Abbie seemed 
as fresh and determined as ever. 

As the juke box came into sight 
again, Matt noticed some commotion around it. The bartender 
was approaching the manager 
with an axe, a glittering fire axe. 
For one whirling moment, Matt 
thought the whole world had gone 
mad. Then he saw the manager 
take the axe and approach the 
juke box cautiously, the axe 
poised in one hand ready to 
strike. 

He brought it down smartly. 
The cord squirmed its coils out 
of the way. The manager 
wrenched the axe from the floor. 
Bravely he advanced closer. He 
looked down and screamed. The 
cord had a loop around one leg; 
the loop was tightening. Frantically the manager swung again and 
again. One stroke hit the cord 
squarely. It parted. The music 
stopped. The box went dark. The 
headless cord squirmed in dying 
agonies. 

Abbie stopped dancing. Matt 
stood still, his legs trembling, 
sighing with relief. 

"Let's go, Abbie," he pleaded. 
"Let's go quick." 



She shook her head. "Let's sit." 
She led him to a table which, 
like the rest of the room, had 
been suddenly vacated of patrons. 
"I reckon you'd like a drink." 

"I'd rather leave," Matt muttered. 

'T'HEY sat down. Imperiously, 
Abbie beckoned at the waiter. 
He came toward the table cautiously. Abbie looked inquiringly 
at Matt. 

"Bourbon," Matt said helplessly. "Straight." 

In a moment the waiter was 
back with a bottle and two glasses 
on a tray. "The boss said to get 
the money first," he said timidly. 

Matt searched his pockets futilely. He looked at the manager, 
standing against one wall, glowering, his arms folded across his 
chest. "I haven't got any money 
on me," Matt said. 

"That's all right," Abbie said. 
"Just set the things down." 

"No, ma'am," the waiter began, 
and his eyes rolled as the tray 
floated out of his hand and settled to the table. He stopped talking, shut his mouth, and backed 
away. 

Abbie was brooding, her chin 
in one small hand. "I ain't been a 
good daughter," she said. "Paw 
would like it here." 

"No, no," Matt said hurriedly. 
"Don't do that. We've got enough 
trouble — "

Jenkins was sitting in the third 
chair, blinking slowly, reeking of 
alcohol. Matt reached for the bottle and sloshed some into a glass. 
He raised it to his lips and tossed 
it off. The liquor burned his 
throat for a moment and then was 
gone. Matt waited expectantly as 
he lowered the glass to the table. 
He felt nothing, nothing at all. 
He looked suspiciously at the 
glass. It was still full. 

Jenkins focused his eyes. "Ab!" 
he said. He seemed to cringe in 
his chair. "What you doin' here? 
You look different. All fixed up. 
Find a feller with money?" 

Abbie ignored his questions. "If 
I asked you to do somethin', Paw, 
would you do it?" 

"Sure, Ab," Jenkins said hurriedly. His eyes lit on the bottle 
of bourbon. "Anything." He 
raised the bottle to his lips. It 
gurgled pleasantly and went on 
gurgling. 

Matt watched the level of amber liquid drop in the bottle, but 
when Jenkins put it down and 
wiped his bearded lips with one 
large hairy hand, the bottle was 
half empty and stayed that way. 
Jenkins sighed heavily. 

Matt raised his glass again and 
tilted it to his lips. When he lowered it, the glass was still full 
and Matt was still empty. He 
stared moodily at the glass. 

"If I asked you to hit Mr. 
Wright in the nose," Abbie went 



on, "I reckon you'd do it?" 

Matt tensed himself. 

"Sure, Ab, sure," Jenkins said. 
He turned his massive head slowly. He doubled his fist. The expression behind the beard was 
unreadable, but Matt decided 
that it was better that way. "Ain't 
you been treatin' mah little gal 
right?" Jenkins demanded. "Say, 
son," he said with concern, "you 
don't look so good." He looked 
back at Abbie. "Want I should 
hit him?" 

"Not now," Abbie said. "But 
keep it in mind." 

Matt relaxed and seized the opportunity to dash the glass to his 
mouth. Futilely. Not a drop of 
liquor reached his stomach. Hopelessly, Matt thought of Tantalus. 

"Police!" Jenkins bellowed suddenly, rising up with the neck of 
the bottle in one huge hand. 
Matt looked. The bartender 
was leading three policemen into 
the front of the room. The officers 
advanced stolidly, confident of 
their ultimate strength and authority. Matt turned quickly to 
Abbie. 

"No tricks," he pleaded. "Not 
with the law." 

Abbie yawned. "I'm tired. I 
reckon it's almost midnight." 

Jenkins charged, bull-like, bellowing with rage. And the room 
vanished. 

Matt blinked, sickened. They 
were back in the cabin. Abbie and

he. "What about your father?" 
Matt asked. 

"Next to liquor," Abbie said, 
"Paw likes a fight best. I'm going 
to bed now. I'm real tired." 

She left her shoes on the floor, 
climbed into her bunk, and pulled 
the blanket around herself. 

"1%/f ATT walked slowly to his 
bunk. Mary had a little 
lamb . . . He sat down on it and 
pulled off his shoes, letting them 
thump to the floor . . . with fleece 
as white as snow . . . He pulled 
the blanket around his bunk and 
made rustling sounds, but he 
lay down without removing his 
clothes . . . and everywhere that 
Mary went . . . He lay stiffly, 
listening to the immediate sounds 
of deep breathing coming from 
the other bunk . . . the lamb was 
sure to go . . . 

Two tortured hours crawled by. 
Matt sat up cautiously. He picked 
up his shoes from the floor. He 
straightened up. Slowly he tiptoed toward the door. Inch by 
inch, listening to Abbie's steady 
breathing, until he was at the 
door. He slipped it open, only a 
foot. He squeezed through and 
drew it shut behind him. 

A porch board creaked. Matt 
froze. He waited. There was no 
sound from inside. He crept over 
the pebbles of the driveway, suppressing exclamations of pain. 
But he did not dare stop to put 



on his shoes. 

He was beside the car. He eased 
the door open and slipped into the 
seat. Blessing the steep driveway, 
he released the brake and pushed 
in the clutch. The car began to 
roll. Slowly at first, then picking 
up speed, the car turned out of 
the driveway into the road. 

Ghostlike in the brilliant moon, 
it sped silent down the long hill. 
After one harrowing tree-darkened turn, Matt switched on the 
lights and gently clicked the door 
to its first catch. 

When he was a mile away, he 
started the motor. 

Escape ! 

1%/|ATT pulled up to the gas 
pump in the gray dawn that 
was already sticky with heat. 
Through the dusty, bug-splattered windshield the bloodshot 
sun peered at him and saw a dark 
young man in stained work 
clothes, his face stubbled blackly, 
his eyes burning wearily. But 
Matt breathed deep; he drew in 
the wine of freedom. 

Was this Fair Play or Humansville? Matt was too tired and 
hungry to remember. Whichever 
it was, all was well. 

It seemed a reasonable assumption that Abbie could not find 
him if she did not know where 
he was, that she could not teleport herself anywhere she had not 
already been. When she had dis


54 




 



appeared the first time, she had 
gone to the places in Springfield 
she knew. She had brought her 
father from his two-room shanty. 
She had taken him back to the 
cabin. 

The sleepy attendant approached, and with him came a 
wash of apprehension to knot his 
stomach. Money! He had no 
money. Hopelessly he began to 
search his pockets. Without 
money he was stuck here, and all 
his money was back in his cabin 
with his clothes and his typewriter 
and his manila folder of notes. 

And then his hand touched 
something in his hip pocket. 
Wonderingly, he pulled it out. It 
was his billfold. He peered at its 
contents. Four dollars in bills and 
three hundred in travelers' checks. 
"Fill it up," he said. 

When had he picked up the 
billfold? Or had he had it all 
the time? He could have sworn 
that he had not had it when he 
was in the cocktail lounge in 
Springfield. He was almost sure 
that he had left it in his suit 
pants. The uncertainty made him 
vaguely uneasy. Or was it only 
hunger? He hadn't eaten since 
toying with Abbie's stolen delicacies yesterday afternoon. 

"Where's a good place to eat?" 
he asked, as the attendant handed 
him change. 

It was an old fellow in coveralls. He pointed a few hundred 



feet up the road. "See those 
trucks parked outside that 
diner?" Matt nodded. "Usual 
thing, when you see them outside, you can depend on good 
food inside. Here it don't mean a 
thing. Food's lousy. We got a 
landmark though. Truckers stop 
to see it." The old fellow cackled. 
"Name's Lola." 

As Matt pulled away, the old 
man called after him. "Don't 
make no difference, anyway. No 
place else open." 

Matt parked beside one of the 
large trailer trucks. Lola? He 
made a wry face as he got out 
of the car. He was through with 
women. 

The diner, built in the shape of 
a railroad car, had a long counter 
running along one side, but it was 
filled with truckers in shirt 
sleeves, big men drinking coffee 
and smoking and teasing the 
waitress. Tiredly, Matt slipped 
into one of the empty booths. 

The waitress detached herself 
from her admirers immediately 
and came to the booth with a 
glass of water in one hand, swinging her hips confidently. She had 
a smoldering, dark beauty, and 
she was well aware of it. Her 
black hair was cut short, and her 
brown eyes and tanned face were 
smiling. Her skirt and low-cut 
peasant blouse bulged generously 
in the right places. Some time — 
and not too many years in the 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



55 



future — she would be fat, but 
right now she was lush, ready to 
be picked by the right hand. 
Matt guessed that she would not 
be a waitress in a small town 
long. As she put the water on 
the table, she bent low to demonstrate just how lush she was. 

The neckline drooped. Against 
his will, Matt's eyes drifted toward her. 

"What'll you have?" the waitress said softly. 

Matt swallowed. "A couple of 
— hotcakes," he said, "with sausages." 

She straightened up slowly, 
smiling brightly at him. "Stack a 
pair," she yelled, "with links." 
She turned around and looked 
enticingly over her shoulder. 
"Coffee?" 

Matt nodded. He smiled a 
little to show that he appreciated 
her attentions. There was no 
doubt about the fact that she was 
an attractive girl. In anyone's 
mind. Any other time . . . 

??r\UCH!" she said suddenly 
^-^ and straightened. She began to rub her rounded bottom 
vigorously and cast Matt a hurt, 
reproachful glance. Slowly her 
pained expression changed to a 
roguish smile. She waggled a 
coy finger at Matt. "Naughty, 
naughty!" the finger said. Matt 
stared at her as if she had lost 
her senses. He shook his head in 



bewilderment as she vanished behind the counter. And then he 
noticed that a couple of the 
truckers had turned around to 
glower at him, and Matt became 
absorbed in contemplating the 
glass of water. 

It made him realize how thirsty 
he was. He drank the whole 
glassful, but it didn't seem to 
help much. He was just as thirsty, 
just as empty. 

Lola wasted no time in bringing Matt's cup of coffee. She carried it casually and efficiently in 
one hand, not spilling a drop into 
the saucer. But as she neared 
Matt the inexplicable happened. 
She tripped over something invisible on the smooth floor. She 
stumbled. The coffee flew in a 
steaming arc and splashed on 
Matt's shirt with incredible accuracy, soaking in hotly. 

Lola gasped, her hand to her 
mouth. Matt leaped up, pulling 
his shirt away from his chest, 
swearing. Lola grabbed a handful 
of paper napkins and began to 
dab at his shirt. 

"Golly, honey, I'm sorry," she 
said warmly. "I can't understand 
how I came to trip." 

She pressed herself close to 
him. Matt could smell the odor 
of gardenias. 

"That's all right," he said, 
drawing back. "It was an accident." 

She followed him up, working 



56 




 



at his shirt. Matt noticed that the 
truckers were all watching, some 
darkly, the rest enviously. He 
slipped back into the booth. 

One of the truckers guffawed. 
"You don't have to spill coffee 
on me, Lola, to make me steam," 
he said. The rest of the truckers 
laughed with him. 

"Oh, shut up!" Lola told them. 
She turned back to Matt. "You 
all right, honey?" 

"Sure, sure," Matt said wearily. 
"Just bring me the hotcakes." 
The coffee had cooled now. His 
shirt felt clammy. Matt thought 
about accident prones. It had to 
be an accident. He glanced uneasily around the diner. The only 
girl here was Lola. 

The hotcakes were ready. She 
was bringing them toward the 
booth, but it was not a simple 
process. Matt had never seen slippery hotcakes before this. Lola 
was so busy that she forgot to 
swing her hips. 

The hotcakes slithered from 
side to side on the plate. Lola 
juggled them, tilting the plate 
back and forth to keep them from 
sliding off. Her eyes were wide 
with astonishment; her mouth 
was a round, red "O"; her forehead was furrowed with concentration. She did an intricate, 
unconscious dance step to keep 
from losing the top hotcake. 

As Matt watched, fascinated, 
the sausages, four of them linked 



together, started to slip from the 
plate. With something approaching sentience, they skilled off and 
disappeared down the low neck 
of Lola's blouse. 

Lola shrieked. She started to 
wriggle, her shoulders hunched. 
While she tried to balance the 
hotcakes with one hand, the 
other dived into the blouse and 
hunted around frantically. Matt 
watched; the truckers watched. 
Lola hunted and wiggled. The 
hand that held the plate flew up. 
The hotcakes scattered. 

One hit the nearest trucker in 
the face. He peeled it off, red and 
bellowing. "A joker!" He dived 
off the stool toward Matt. 

It/TATT tried to get up, but the 

-L" table caught him in his 
stomach. He climbed up on the 
seat. The hotcake the trucker had 
discarded had landed on the head 
of the man next to him. He stood 
up angrily. 

Lola had finally located the 
elusive sausages. She drew them 
out of their intimate hiding place 
with a shout of triumph. They 
whipped into the open mouth of 
the lunging trucker. He stopped, 
transfixed, strangling. 

"Argh-gh-uggle!" he said. 

A cup crashed against the wall, 
close to Matt's head. Matt 
ducked. If he could get over the 
back of this booth, he could 
reach the door. The place was 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



57 



filled with angry shouts and 
angrier faces and bulky shoulders approaching. Lola took one 
frightened loolf and grabbed 
Matt around the knees. 

"Protect me!" she said wildly. 

The air was filled with missiles. 
Matt reached down to disengage 
Lola's fear-strengthened arms. He 
glanced up to see the trucker 
spitting out the last of the sausages. With a maddened yell, the 
trucker threw a heavy fist at 
Matt. Hampered as he was, Matt 
threw himself back hopelessly. 
Something ripped. The fist 
breezed past and crashed through 
a window. 

Matt hung over the back of the 
booth, head downward, unable to 
get back up, unable to shake 
Lola loose. Everywhere he looked 
he could see rage-enflamed faces. 
He closed his eyes and surrendered himself to his fate. 

From somewhere, above the 
tumult, came the sound of 
laughter, like the tinkling of little 
silver bells. 

Then Matt was outside with no 
idea of how he had got there. 
In his hand was a strip of thin 
fabric. Lola's blouse. Poor Lola, 
he thought, as he threw it away. 
What was his fatal fascination 
for girls? 

Behind him the diner was alive 
with lights and the crash of 
dishes and the smacking of fists 
on flesh. Before long they would 



discover that he was gone. 

Matt ran to his car. It started 
to life when he punched the button. He backed it up, screeched it 
to a stop, jerked into first, and 
barreled onto the highway. Within twenty seconds, he was doing 
sixty. 

He turned to look back at the 
diner and almost lost control of 
the car as he tried to absorb the 
implications of the contents on 
the back seat. 

Resting neatly there were his 
typewriter, notes, and all his 
clothes. 

WHEN Matt pulled to a stop 
on the streets of Clinton, he 
was feeling easier mentally and 
much worse physically. The dip 
in a secluded stream near the 
road, the change of clothes, and 
the shave — torturing as it had 
been in cold water — had refreshed 
him for a while. But that had 
worn off, and the lack of a 
night's sleep and twenty-four 
hours without food were catching up with him. 

Better that, he thought grimly, 
than Abbie. He could endure 
anything for a time. 

As for the typewriter and the 
notes and the clothes, there was 
probably some simple explanation. The one Matt liked best was 
that Abbie had had a change of 
heart; she had expected him to 
leave and she had made his way 



58 




 



easy. She was, Matt thought, a 
kind-hearted child underneath it 
all. 

The trouble with that explanation was that Matt didn't believe 
it. 

He shrugged. There were more 
pressing things — money, for instance. Gas was getting low, and 
he needed to get something in his 
stomach if he was to keep up 
his strength for the long drive 
ahead. He had to cash one of his 
checks. That seemed simple 
enough. The bank was at the 
corner of this block. It was eleven 
o'clock. The bank would be open. 
Naturally they would cash a 
check. 

But for some reason Matt felt 
uneasy. 

Matt walked into the bank and 
went directly to a window. He 
countersigned one of the checks 
and presented it to the teller, a 
thin little man with a wispy mustache and a bald spot on top of 
his head. The teller compared the 
signatures and turned to the shelf 
at his side where bills stood in 
piles, some still wrapped. He 
counted out four twenties, a ten, a 
five, and five ones. 

"Here you are, sir," he said 
politely. 

Matt accepted it only because 
his hand was outstretched and 
the teller put the money in it. His 
eyes were fixed in horror upon 
a wrapped bundle of twenty dol


lar bills which was slowly rising 
from the shelf. It climbed leisurely over the top of the cage. 

"What's the matter, sir?" the 
teller asked in alarm. "Do you 
feel sick?" 

Matt nodded once and then 
tore his eyes away and shook his 
head vigorously. "No," he gasped. 
"I'm all right." He took a step 
back from the window. 

"Are you sure? You don't look 
well at all." 

WITH a shrinking feeling, 
Matt felt something fumble 
its way into his right hand coat 
pocket. He plunged his hand in 
after it. His empty stomach revolved in his abdomen. He could 
not mistake the touch of crisp 
paper. He stooped quickly beneath the teller's window. The 
teller leaned out. Matt straightened up, the package of bills in 
his hand. 

"I guess you must have 
dropped this," he muttered. 

The teller glanced at the shelf 
and back at the sheaf of twenties. 
"I don't see how — But thank you! 
That's the funniest — " 

Matt pushed the bills under the 
grillwork. "Yes, isn't it," he 
agreed hurriedly. "Well, thank 
you." 

"Thank you!" 

Matt lifted his hand. The 
money lifted with it. The package stuck to his hand as if it 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



59 



had been attached with glue. 

"Excuse me," he said feebly. "I 
can't seem to get rid of this 
money." He shook his hand. The 
money clung stubbornly. He 
shook his hand again, violently. 
The package of bills did not 
budge. 

"Very funny," the teller said, 
but he was not smiling. From 
his tone of voice, Matt suspected 
that he thought money was a 
very serious business indeed. The 
teller reached under the bars and 
caught hold of one end of the 
package. "You can let go now," 
he said. "Let go!" 

Matt tried to pull his hand 
away. "I can't!" he said, breathing heavily. 

The teller tugged, Matt tugged. 
"I haven't time to play games," 
the teller panted. "Let go!" 

"I don't want it," Matt said 
frantically. "But it seems to be 
stuck. Look!" He showed his 
hand, fingers spread wide. 

The teller grabbed the bundle 
of bills with both hands and 
braced his feet against the front 
of his cubicle. "Let go!" he 
shouted. 

Matt pulled hard. Suddenly 
the tension on his arm vanished. 
His arm whipped back. The teller 
disappeared into the bottom of 
the cubicle. Something clanged 
hollowly. Matt looked at his 
hand. The bills were gone. 

Slowly the teller's head ap


peared from the concealed part 
of the cubicle. It came up, accompanied by groans, with a red 
swelling in the middle of the bald 
spot. After it came the teller's 
hand, waving the package of 
twenties triumphantly. The other 
hand was rubbing his head. 

"Are you still here?" he demanded, slamming the bills down 
at his side. "Get out of this bank. 
And if you ever come back I'll 
have you arrested for — for disturbing the peace." 

"Don't worry," Matt said. "I 
won't be back." His face suddenly grew pale. "Stop" he said 
frantically, waving his arms. "Go 
back!" 

The teller stared at him, fearfully, indecisively. 

rpHE bundle of twenties was 
rising over the top of the 
cage again. Instinctively, Matt 
grabbed them out of the air. His 
mind clicked rapidly. If he was 
to keep out of jail, there was only 
one thing to do. He advanced on 
the teller angrily, waving the bills 
in the air. 

"What do you mean by throwing these at me!" 

"Throwing money?" the teller 
said weakly. "Me?" 

Matt shook the bills in front of 
the teller's nose. "What do you 
call this?" 

The clerk glanced at the money 
and down at his side. "Oh, no!" 



60 




 




he moaned. 

"I have a good mind," Matt 
said violently, "to complain to 
the president of this bank." He 
slammed the bills down. He 
closed his eyes in a silent 
prayer "Tellers throwing money 
around!" 

He took his hand away. Blissfully, the money stayed where it 
was on the counter. The teller 
reached for it feebly. The package shifted. He reached again. 
The bills slid away. He stuck both 
hands through the slot and 
groped wildly. The money slipped 
between his arms into the cage. 

Matt stood shifting his weight 
from foot to foot, paralyzed between flight and fascination. The 
bundle winged its way around in 
the cage like a drunken butterfly. 
Wide-eyed and frantic, the teller 
chased it from side to side. He 
made great diving swoops for it, 
his hands cupped into a net. He 
crept up on it and pounced, catlike, only to have to slip between 
his fingers at the last moment. 
Suddenly he stopped, frozen. His 
hands flew to his head. 

"My God!" he screamed. 
"What am I doing? I'm mad!" 

Matt backed toward the door. 
The other clerks and tellers were 
running toward the center of the 
disturbance. Matt saw a dignified 
gentleman with a paunch stand 
up inside a railed-in office and 
hurdle the obstacle with fine 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE

show of athletic form. 

Matt turned and ran, dodging 
the guard at the gate. "Get the 
doctor," he yelled. 

From somewhere came the 
sound of a tinkling of little silver 
bells. 

There was no doubt in Matt's 
mind as he gunned his car out 
of Clinton. Abbie was after him. 
He had not been free a moment. 
All the time she had known where 
to find him. He was the fleeing 
mouse, happy in his illusion of 
freedom — until the cat's paw 
comes down on his back. Matt 
thought of the Furies — awful 
Alecto, Tisiphone, Megaera — in 
their blood-stained robes and 
serpent hair pursuing him across 
the world with their terrible 
whips. But they all had Abbie's 
face. 

Matt drove north toward Kansas City, thirsty, starving, half 
dead from fatigue, wondering 
hopelessly where it would end. 

rvARKENING shades of violet 
U were creeping up the eastern 
sky as Matt reached Lawrence, 
Kansas. He had not tried to stop 
in Kansas City. Something had 
drawn him on, some buried hope 
that still survived feebly, and 
when, five miles from Lawrence, 
he had seen Mount Oread rise 
against the sunset, the white 
spires and red tile roofs of the 
university gleaming like beacons, 



he had known what it was. 

Here was a citadel of knowledge, a fortress of the world's 
truth against black waves of ignorance and superstition. Here, in 
this saner atmosphere of study 
and reflection, logic and cool 
consideration, here, if anywhere, 
he could shake off this dark conviction of doom that sapped his 
will. Here, surely, he could think 
more clearly, act more decisively, 
rid himself of this demon of 
vengeance that rode his shoulders. 
Here he could get help. 

He drove down Massachusetts 
Street, his body leaden with fatigue, his eyes red-rimmed and 
shadowed searching restlessly 
from side to side. His hunger was 
only a dull ache; he could almost 
forget it. But his thirst was a live 
thing. Somewhere — he could not 
remember where — he had eaten 
and drunk, but they had vanished 
from his throat as he swallowed. 

Is there no end? he thought 
wildly. Is there no way out? 
There was, of course. There always is. Always — Mary had a 
little lamb . . . 

Impulse swung his car into the 
diagonal parking space. First he 
was going to drink and eat, 
come what may. He walked into 
the restaurant. Summer students 
filled the room, young men in 
sport shirts and slacks, girls in 
gay cotton prints and saddle 
shoes, laughing, talking, eating . . . 



62 




 



Swaying in the doorway, Matt 
watched them, bleary-eyed. Once 
I was like them, he thought dully. 
Young and alive and conscious 
that these were the best years I 
would ever know. Now I am old 
and used up, doomed . . . 

He slumped down at a table 
near the front, filled with a great 
surge of sorrow that all happiness 
was behind him. He was conscious that the waitress was beside him. "Soup," he mumbled. 
"Soup and milk." He did not look 
up. 

"Yes, sir," she said. Her voice 
sounded vaguely familiar, but 
they are all the same, all the 
voices of youth. He had eaten 
here before. He did not look up. 

Slowly he raised the glass of 
water to his lips. It went down his 
throat in dusty gulps. It spread 
out in his stomach in cool, blessed 
waves. Matt closed his eyes 
thankfully. The hunger pains began to return. For a moment 
Matt regretted the soup and 
wished he had ordered steak. 

After the soup, he thought. 

The soup came. Matt lifted a 
spoonful. He let it trickle down 
his throat. 

"Feelin' better, Mr. Wright," 
said the waitress. 

Tt/fATT looked up. He strangled. 
-L" It was Abbie! Abbie's face 
bending over him. Matt choked 
and spluttered. Students turned 



to stare. Matt gazed around the 
room wildly. The girls — they all 
looked like Abbie. He stood up, 
almost knocking over the table 
as he ran to the front door. 

With his hand on the door 
knob, he stopped, paralyzed. 
Staring in at him, through the 
glass, was a pair of bloodshot 
eyes set above an unruly black 
nest. Stooped, powerful shoulders 
loomed behind the face. As Matt 
stared back, the eyes lighted up 
as if they recognized him. 

"Argh-gh!" Matt screamed. 

He staggered back and turned 
on trembling legs. He tottered 
toward the back of the restaurant. The aisle seemed full of feet 
put out to trip him. He stumbled 
to the swinging kitchen door and 
broke through into odors of frying and baking that no longer 
moved him. 

The cook looked up, startled. 
Matt ran on through the kitchen 
and plunged through the back 
door. The alley was dark. Matt 
barked his shins on a box. He 
limped on, cursing. At one end of 
the alley a street light spread a 
pool of welcome. Matt ran toward 
it. He was panting. His heart beat 
fast. Then it almost stopped. A 
shadow lay along the mouth of 
the alley. A long shadow with 
huge shoulders and something 
that waved from the chin. 

Matt spun. He ran frantically 
toward the other end of the alley. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



63 



His mind raced like an engine 
that has broken its governor. 
Nightmarish terror streaked 
through his arms and legs; they 
seemed distant and leaden. But 
slowly he approached the other 
end. He came nearer. Nearer. 

A shadow detached itself from 
the dark back walls. But it was 
no shadow. Matt slowed, stopped. 
The shadow came closer, towering tall above him. Matt cowered, 
unable to move. Closer. Two long 
arms reached out toward him. 
Matt quivered. He waited for the 
end. The arms wrapped around 
him. They drew him close. 

"Son, son," Jenkins said weakly. "Yore the first familiar face 
I seen all day." 

Matt's heart started beating 
again. He drew back, extracting 
his face from Jenkin's redolent 
beard. 

"Cain't understand what's goin' on these days," Jenkins said 
shaking his head sadly, "but I 
got a feelin' Ab's behint it. Just 
as that fight got goin' good, the 
whole shebang disappeared and 
here I was. Where am I, son?" 

"Kansas," Matt said. "Lawrence, Kansas." 

"Kansas?" Jenkins wobbled his 
beard. "Last I heard, Kansas was 
dry, but it can't be half as dry 
as I am. I recollect hearin' Quantrell burned this town. Too bad it 
didn't stay burned. Here I was 
without a penny in my pocket 



and only what was left in the 
bottle I had in my hand to keep 
me from dyin' of thirst. Son," he 
said sorrowfully, "somethin's got 
to be done. It's Ab, ain't it?" 
Matt nodded. 

"Son," Jenkins went on, "I'm 
gettin' too old for this kind of 
life. I should be sittin' on my 
porch with a jug in my lap, just 
a-rockin' slow. Somethin's got to 
be done about that gal." 

"I'm afraid it's too late for 
that," Matt said. 

"That's the trouble," Jenkins 
said mournfully. "Been too late 
for these six years. Son, yore an 
edyicated inan. What we gonna 
do?" 

"I can't tell you, Jenkins," 
Matt said. "I can't even think 
about it." Mary had a little lamb 
. . . "If I did, it wouldn't work. 
But if you want to hit me, go 
ahead. I'm the man who's responsible." 

Jenkins put a large hand on his 
shoulder. "Don't worry about it, 
son. If it weren't you, it would've 
been some other man. When Ab 
gets a notion, you cain't beat it 
out of her. I learned that years 
ago." 

Matt pulled out his billfold and 
handed Jenkins a five dollar bill. 
"Here. Kansas isn't dry any more. 
Go get something and try to forget. Maybe when you're finished 
with that, things will have 
changed."

"Yore a good boy, son. Don't 
do nothin' rash." 

Mary had a little lamb . . . 

JENKINS turned, raising his 
hand in a parting salute. Matt 
watched the mountainous shadow 
dwindle, as if it was his last contact with the living. Then Jenkins rounded the corner and was 
out of sight. 

Matt walked slowly back to 
Massachusetts Street. There was 
one more thing he had to do. 

As he reached the car, Matt 
sensed Abbie's nearness. The 
awareness was so sharp that it 
was almost physical. He felt her 
all around, like dancing motes of 
dust that are only visible under 
certain conditions, half angel, half 
devil, half love, half hate. It was 
an unendurable mixture, an impossible combination to live with. 
The extremes were too great. 

Matt sighed. It was not Abbie's 
fault. If it was anyone's fault, 
it was his. "Inevitably, he would 
pay for it. The Universe has an 
immutable law of action and reaction. 

It was dark as Matt drove 
along Seventh Street. The night 
was warm, and the infrequent 
street lights were only beacons 
for nightflying insects. Matt 
turned a corner and pulled up in 
front of a big old house surrounded by an ornamental iron 
fence. The house was a two


story stucco, painted yellow — or 
perhaps it had once been white — 
and the fence sagged in places. 

Most of the houses in Lawrence 
are old. The finest and the newest are in the west, on the ridge 
overlooking the Wakarusa Valley, 
but university professors cannot 
afford such sites or such houses. 

Matt rang the bell. In a moment the door opened. Blinking 
out of the light was Professor 
Franklin, his faculty adviser. 

"Matt!" Franklin said. "I didn't 
recognize you for a second. What 
are you doing back so soon? I 
thought you were secluded in the 
Ozarks. Don't tell me you have 
your thesis finished already?" 

"No, Dr. Franklin," Matt said 
wearily, "but I'd like to talk to 
you for a moment if you can 
spare the time." 

"Come in, come in. I'm just 
grading some papers." Franklin 
grimaced. "Freshman papers." 

Franklin led the way into his 
book-cluttered study off the living 
room. His glasses were resting on 
top of a pile of papers. He picked 
them up, slipped them on, and 
turned to Matt. He was a tall 
man, a little stooped now in his 
sixties, with gray, unruly hair. 

"Matt!" he exclaimed. "You 
aren't looking well. Have you 
been sick?" 

"In a way," Matt said, "you 
might call it that. How would 
you treat someone who believes 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



65 



in the reality of psychic phenomena?" 

Franklin shrugged. "Lots of 
people believe in it and are still 
worthwhile, reliable members of 
society. Conan Doyle, for instance — " 

"And could prove it," Matt 
added. 

"Hallucinations? Then it becomes more serious. I suppose 
psychiatric treatment would be 
necessary. Remember, Matt, I'm 
a teacher, not a practitioner. But 
look here, you aren't suggesting 
that—?" 

Matt nodded. "I can prove it, 
and I don't want to. Would it 
make the world any better, any 
happier?" 

"The truth is always important 
— for itself if for nothing else. 
But you can't be serious — " 

"Dead serious." Matt shivered. 
"Suppose I could prove that there 
were actually such things as levitation, teleportation, telepathy. 
There isn't any treatment, is 
there, Professor, when a man goes 
sane?" 

"Matt! You are sick, aren't 
you?" 

"Suppose," Matt went on relentlessly, "that your glasses 
should float over and come to 
rest on my nose. What would you 
say then?" 

"I'd say you need to see a 
psychiatrist," Franklin said worriedly. "You do, Matt." 



TTIS glasses gently detached 
themselves and floated leisurely through the air and adjusted themselves on Matt's face. 
Franklin stared blindly. 

"Matt!" he exclaimed, groping. 
"That isn't very funny." 

Matt sighed and handed the 
glasses back. Franklin put them 
back on, frowning. 

"Suppose," Matt said, "I 
should float in the air?" As he 
spoke, he felt himself lifting. 

Franklin looked up. "Come 
down here!" 

Matt came back into his chair. 

"These tricks," Franklin said 
sternly, "aren't very seemly. Go 
to a doctor, Matt. Don't waste 
any time. And," he added, taking 
off his glasses and polishing them 
vigorously, "I think I'll see my 
oculist in the morning." 

Matt sighed again. "I was 
afraid that was the way it would 
be. Abbie?" 

Franklin stared. 

"Yes, Mr. Wright." The words, 
soft and gentle, came out of midair. 

Franklin's eyes searched the 
room frantically. 

"Thanks," Matt said. 

"Leave this house!" Franklin 
said, his voice trembling. "I've 
had enough of these pranks!" 

Matt got up and went to the 
front door. "I'm afraid Dr. 
Franklin doesn't believe in you. 
But I do. Good-by, Dr. Franklin. 



66 




 



I don't think a doctor would cure 
what I've got." 

When he left, Franklin was 
searching the living room. 

rpHERE was something strangely final about the drive 
through the campus. Along 
Oread street on top of Mount 
Oread, overlooking the Kaw Valley on the north and the Wakarusa on the south, the university buildings stood dark and 
deserted. Only the Student Union 
was lighted and the library and 
an occasional bulletin board. The 
long arms of the administration 
building were gloomy, and the 
night surrounded the white arches 
of Hoch Auditorium . . . 

He pulled into the parking area 
behind the apartment building 
and got out and walked slowly 
to the entrance. He hoped that 
Guy wouldn't be in. 

Matt opened the door. The 
apartment was empty. He turned 
on a living rpom lamp. The room 
was in typical disarray. A sweater 
on the davenport, books in the 
chair. 

In the dark, Matt went to the 
kitchen. He bumped into the 
stove and swore, and rubbed his 
hip. Mary had a little lafhb . . . 
Somewhere around here . . . 

Some hidden strength kept 
Matt from dropping in his tracks. 
He should have collapsed from 
exhaustion and hunger long ago. 

WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



But soon there would be time to 
rest . . . and everywhere that 
Mary went . . . He stooped. There 
it was. The sugar. The sugar. He 
had always liked blue sugar. 

He found a package of cereal 
and got the milk from the refrigerator. He found a sharp knife 
in the drawer and sliced the box 
in two. He dumped the contents 
into a bowl and poured the milk 
over it and sprinkled the sugar 
on top. The blue sugar . . . with 
fleece as white as snow . . . He 
was very sleepy. 

He lifted a spoonful of the 
cereal to his mouth. He chewed 
it for a moment. He swallowed . . . 

And it was gone. 

He grabbed the knife and 
plunged it toward his chest. 

And his hand was empty. 

He was very sleepy. His head 
drooped. Suddenly it straightened 
up. The hissing had stopped. A 
long time ago. He turned on the 
light and saw that the burner was 
turned off, the one that never 
lighted from the pilot, the one he 
had stumbled against. 

The blue insect poison had 
failed and the knife and the gas. 

He felt a great wave of despair. 
It was no use. There was no way 
out. 

TTE walked back to the living 
room, brushed the sweater off 
the davenport, and sat down. The 
last hope — beyond which there is 

67 



no hope — was gone. And yet, in a 
way, he was glad that his tricks 
had not worked. Not that he was 
still alive but because it had been 
the coward's way. All along he 
had been trying to dodge the only 
solution that faced him at every 
turn. He had refused to recognize 
it, but now there was no other 
choice. 

It was the hard way, the bitter 
way. The way that was not a 
quick death but a slow one. But 
he owed it to the world to sacrifice himself on the altar he 
had raised, under the knife he had 
honed, wielded by the arm that 
he had given strength and skill 
and* consciousness . 

He looked up. "All right, Abbie," he sighed. "I'll marry you." 

The words hung in the air. 
Matt waited, filled with a fear 
that was half hope. 

Was it too late for anything but 
vengeance? 

But Abbie filled his arms, cuddled against him in homely blue 
gingham, scarcely bigger than a 
child but with the warmth and 
softness of a woman. She was 
more beautiful than Matt had remembered. Her arms crept 
around his neck. 

"Will you, Mr. Wright?" she 
whispered. "Will you?" 

A vision built itself up in his 
mind. The omniscient, omnipotent wife, fearsome when her powers were sheathed, terrible in 

68 



anger or disappointment. No man, 
he thought, was ever called upon 
for greater sacrifice. But he was 
the appointed lamb. 

He sighed. "God help me," he 
said, "I will." 

He kissed her. Her lips were 
sweet and passionate. 

MATTHEW Wright was lucky, 
of course, far luckier than he 
deserved to be, than any man 
deserves to be. 

The bride was beautiful. But 
more important and much more 
significant — 

The bride was happy.
