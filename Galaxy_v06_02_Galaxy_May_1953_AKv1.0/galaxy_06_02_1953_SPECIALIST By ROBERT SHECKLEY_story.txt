SPECIALIST By ROBERT SHECKLEY 



THE photon storm struck 
without warning, pouncing 
upon the Ship from behind 
a bank of giant red stars. Eye 
barely had time to flash a last 
second warning through Talker 
before it was upon them. 

It was Talker's third journey 
into deep space, and his first 
light-pressure storm. He felt a 
sudden pang of fear as the Ship 
yawed violently, caught the force 
of the wave-front and careened 
end for end. Then the fear was 
gone, replaced by a strong pulse 
of excitement. 
Why should he be afraid, he 
asked himself — hadn't he been 




trained for just this sort of emergency? 

He had been talking to Feeder 
when the storm hit, but he cut 
off the conversation abruptly. He 
hoped Feeder would be all right. 
It was the youngster's first deep 
space trip. 

The wirelike filaments that 
made up most of Talker's body 
were extended throughout the 
Ship. Quickly he withdrew all 
except the ones linking him to 
Eye, Engine, and the Walls. This 
was strictly their job now. The 
rest of the Crew would have to 
shift for themselves until the 
storm was over. 

Eye had flattened his disklike 
body against a Wall, and had 
one seeing organ extended outside the Ship. For greater concentration, the rest of his seeing 
organs were collapsed, clustered 
against his body. 

Through Eye's seeing organ, 
Talker watched the storm. He 
translated Eye's purely visual 
image into a direction for Engine, 
who shoved the Ship around to 
meet the waves. At appreciably 
the same time, Talker translated 
direction into velocity for the 
Walls, who stiffened to meet the 
shocks. 

The coordination was swift 
and sure — Eye measuring the 
waves, Talker relaying the messages to Engine and Walls, Engine driving the ship nose-first 



into the waves, and Walls bracing to meet the shock. 

Talker forgot any fear he 
might have had in the swiftly 
functioning teamwork. He had 
no time to think. As the Ship's 
communication system, he had to 
translate- and flash his messages 
at top speed, coordinating information and directing action. 

In a matter of minutes, the 
storm was over. 

"ALL right," Talker said. 

Let's see if there was any 
damage." His filaments had become tangled during the storm, 
but he untwisted and extended 
them through the Ship, plugging 
everyone into circuit. "Engine?" 

"I'm fine," Engine said. The 
tremendous old fellow had dampened his plates during the storm, 
easing down the atomic explosions in his stomach. No storm 
could catch an experienced spacer like Engine unaware. 

"Walls?" 

The Walls reported one by 
one, and this took a long time. 
There were almost a thousand 
of them, thin, rectangular fellows 
making up the entire skin of the 
Ship. Naturally, they had reinforced their edges during the 
storm, giving the whole Ship resiliency. But one or two were 
dented badly. 

Doctor announced that he was 
all right. He removed Talker's 



70 




 



filament from his head, taking 
himself out of circuit, and went 
to work on the dented Walls. 
Made mostly of hands, Doctor 
had clung to an Accumulator 
during the storm. 

"Let's go a little faster now," 
Talker said, remembering that 
there still was the problem of 
determining where they were. He 
opened the circuit to the four 
Accumulators. "How are you?" 
he asked. 

There was no answer. The Accumulators were asleep. They 
had had their receptors open 
during the storm and were bloated on energy. Talker twitched 
his filaments around them, but 
they didn't stir. 

"Let me," Feeder said. Feeder 
had taken quite a beating before 
planting his suction cups to a 
Wall, but his cockiness was intact. He was the only member 
of the Crew who never needed 
Doctor's attention; his body was 
quite capable of repairing itself. 

He scuttled across the floor on 
a dozen or so tentacles, and 
booted the nearest Accumulator. 
The big, conial storage unit 
opened one eye, then closed it 
again. Feeder kicked him again, 
getting no response. He reached 
for the Accumulator's safety 
valve and drained off some energy. 

"Stop that," the Accumulator 
said. 



"Then wake up and report," 
Talker told him. 

The Accumulators said testily 
that they were all right, as any 
fool could see. They had been 
anchored to the floor during the 
storm. 

'T'HE rest of the inspection went 
-"- quickly. Thinker was fine, 
and Eye was ecstatic over the 
beauty of the storm. There was 
only one casualty. 

Pusher was dead. Bipedal, he 
didn't have the stability of the 
rest of the Crew. The storm had 
caught him in the middle of a 
floor, thrown him against a stiffened Wall, and broken several 
of his important bones. He was 
beyond Doctor's skill to repair. 

They were silent for a while. 
It was always serious when a 
part of the Ship died. The Ship 
was a cooperative unit, composed entirely of the Crew. The 
loss of any member was a blow 
to all the rest. 

It was especially serious now. 
They had just delivered a cargo 
to a port several thousand lightyears from Galactic Center. 
There was no telling where they 
might be. 

Eye crawled to a Wall and extended a seeing organ outside. 
The Walls let it through, then 
sealed around it. Eye's organ 
pushed out, far enough from the 
Ship so he could view the entire 



SPECIALIST 



71 



sphere of stars. The picture traveled through Talker, who gave 
it to Thinker. 

Thinker lay in one corner of 
the room, a great shapeless blob 
of protoplasm. Within him were 
all the memories of his space going ancestors. He considered 
the picture, compared it rapidly 
with others stored in his cells, 
and said, "No galactic planets 
within reach." 

Talker automatically translated for everyone. It was what 
they had feared. 

Eye, with Thinker's help, calculated that they were several 
hundred light-years off their 
course, on the galactic periphery. 

Every Crew member knew 
what that meant. Without a 
Pusher to boost the Ship to a 
multiple of the speed of light, 
they would never get home. The 
trip back, without a Pusher, 
would take longer than most of 
their lifetimes. 

"What would you suggest?" 
Talker asked Thinker. 

This was too vague a question 
for the literal-minded Thinker. 
He asked to have it rephrased. 

"What would be our best line 
of action," Talker asked, "to get 
back to a galactic planet?" 

Thinker needed several minutes to go through all the possibilities stored in his cells. In the 
meantime, Doctor had patched 
the Walls and was asking to be 



given something to eat. 

"In a little while we'll all eat," 
Talker said, twitching his tendrils nervously. Even though he 
was the second youngest Crew 
member — only Feeder was 
younger — the responsibility was 
largely on him. This was still an 
emergency; he had to coordinate 
information and direct action. 

ONE of the Falls suggested 
that they get good and 
drunk. This unrealistic solution 
was vetoed at once. It was typical of the Walls' attitude, however. They were fine workers and 
good shipmates, but happy-golucky fellows at best. When they 
returned to their home planets, 
they would probably blow all 
their wages on a spree. 

"Loss of Ship's Pusher cripples 
the Ship for sustained fasterthan-light speeds," Thinker began without preamble. "The 
nearest galactic planet is four 
hundred and five light-years off." 

Talker translated all this instantly along his wave-packet 
body. 

"Two courses of action are 
open. First, the Ship can proceed 
to the nearest galactic planet under atomic power from Engine. 
This will take approximately 
two hundred years. Engine might 
still be alive at this time, although no one else will. 

"Second, locate a primitive 



72 




 



planet in this region, upon which 
are latent Pushers. Find one and 
train him. Have him push the 
Ship back to galactic territory." 

Thinker was silent, having 
given all the possibilities he could 
find in the memories of his ancestors. 

They held a quick vote and 
decided upon Thinker's second 
alternative. There was no choice, 
really. It was the only one which 
offered them any hope of getting 
back to their homes. 

"All right," Talker said. "Let's 
eat. I think we all deserve it." 

The body of the dead Pusher 
was shoved into the mouth of 
Engine, who consumed it at once, 
breaking down the atoms to energy. Engine was the only member of the Crew who lived on 
atomic energy. 

For the rest, Feeder dashed up 
and loaded himself from the 
nearest Accumulator. Then he 
transformed the food within him 
into the substances each member 
ate. His body chemistry changed, 
altered, adapted, making the different foods for the Crew. 

Eye lived entirely on a complex chlorophyl chain. Feeder 
reproduced this for him, then 
went over to give Talker his 
hydrocarbons, and the Walls 
their chlorine compound. For 
Doctor he made a facsimile of a 
silicate fruit that grew on Doctor's native planet. 



FINALLY, feeding was over 
and the Ship back in order. 
The Accumulators were stacked 
in a corner, blissfully sleeping 
again. Eye was extending his 
vision as far as he could, shaping 
his main seeing organ for highpowered telescopic reception. 
Even in this emergency, Eye 
couldn't resist making verses. He 
announced that he was at work 
on a new narrative poem, called 
Peripheral Glow. No one wanted 
to hear it, so Eye fed it to Thinker, who stored everything, good 
or bad, right or wrong. 

Engine never slept. Filled to 
the brim on Pusher, he shoved 
the Ship along at several times 
the speed of light. 

The Walls were arguing among 
themselves about who had been 
the drunkest during their last 
leave. 

Talker decided to make himself comfortable. He released his 
hold on the Walls and swung in 
the air, his small round body 
suspended by his crisscrossed 
network of filaments. 

He thought briefly about 
Pusher. It was strange. Pusher 
had been everyone's friend and 
now he was forgotten. That 
wasn't because of indifference; it 
was because the Ship was a unit. 
The loss of a member was regretted, but the important thing 
was for the unit to go on. 

The Ship raced through the 



SPECIALIST 



73 



suns of the periphery. 

Thinker laid out a search 
spiral, calculating their odds on 
finding a Pusher planet at roughly four to one. In a week they 
found a planet of primitive 
Walls. Dropping low, they could 
see the leathery, rectangular fellows basking in the sun, crawling 
over rocks, stretching themselves 
thin in order to float in the 
breeze. 

All the Ship's Walls heaved a 
sigh of nostalgia. It was just like 
home. 

These Walls on the planet 
hadn't been contacted by a galactic team yet, and were still unaware of their great destiny — to 
join in the vast Cooperation of 
the Galaxy. 

There were plenty of dead 
worlds in the spiral, and worlds 
too young to bear life. They 
found a planet of Talkers. The 
Talkers had extended their spidery communication lines across 
half a continent. 

Talker looked at them eagerly, 
through Eye. A wave of self-pity 
washed over him. He remembered home, his family, his 
friends. He thought of the tree 
he was planning to buy when he 
got back. 

For a moment, Talker wondered what he was doing here, 
part of a Ship in a far corner of 
the Galaxy. 

He shrugged off the mood. 



They were bound to find a Pusher planet, if they looked long 
enough. 

At least, he hoped so. 

THERE was a long stretch of 
arid worlds as the Ship pushed through the unexplored periphery. Then a planetful of 
primeval Engines, swimming in a 
radioactive ocean. 

"This is rich territory," Feeder 
said to Talker. "Galactic should 
send a Contact party here." 

"They probably will, after we 
get back," Talker said. 

They were good friends, above 
and beyond the all-enveloping 
friendship of the Crew. It wasn't 
only because they were the 
youngest Crew members, although that had something to do 
with it. They both had the same 
kind of functions and that made 
for a certain rapport. Talker 
translated languages ; Feeder 
transformed foods. Also, they 
looked somewhat alike. Talker 
was a central core with radiating 
filaments; Feeder was a central 
core with radiating tentacles. 

Talker thought that Feeder 
was the next most aware being 
on the Ship. He was never really 
able to understand how some of 
the others carried on the processes of consciousness. 

More suns, more planets. Engine started to overheat. Usually, 
Engine was used only for taking 



74 




 



off and landing, and for fine 
maneuvering in a planetary 
group. Now he had been running 
continuously for weeks, both 
over and under the speed of light. 
The strain was telling on him. 

Feeder, with Doctor's help, rigged a cooling system for him. It 
was crude, but it had to suffice. 
Feeder rearranged nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen atoms to make 
a coolant for the system. Doctor 
diagnosed a long rest for Engine. 
He said that the gallant old fellow couldn't stand the strain for 
more than a week. 

The search continued, with the 
Crew's spirits gradually dropping. They all realized that 
Pushers were rather rare in the 
Galaxy, as compared to the fertile Walls and Engines. 

The Walls were getting pockmarked from interstellar dust. 
They complained that they would 
need a full beauty treatment 
when they got home. Talker assured them that the -company 
would pay for it. 

Even Eye was getting bloodshot from staring into space so 
continuously. 

They dipped over another 
planet. Its characteristics were 
flashed to Thinker, who mulled 
over them. 

Closer, and they could make 
out the forms. 

Pushers! Primitive Pushers! 

They zoomed back into space 



to make plans. Feeder produced 
twenty -three different kinds of 
intoxicants for a celebration. 

The Ship wasn't fit to function 
for three days. 

EVERYONE ready now?" 
Talker asked, a bit fuzzily. 
He had a hangover that burned 
all along his nerve ends. What a 
drunk he had thrown! He had a 
vague recollection of embracing 
Engine, inviting him to share his 
tree when they got back home. 
He shuddered at the idea. 
The rest of the Crew were 
pretty shaky, too. The Walls 
were letting air leak into space; 
they were just too wobbly to seal 
their edges properly. Doctor had 
passed out. 

But the worst off was Feeder. 
Since his system could adapt to 
any type of fuel except atomic, 
he had been sampling every 
batch he made, whether it was 
an unbalanced iodine, pure oxygen or a supercharged ester. He 
was really miserable. His tentacles, usually a healthy aqua, 
were shot through with orange 
streaks. His system was working 
furiously, purging itself of everything, and Feeder was suffering 
the effects of the purge. 

The only sober ones were 
Thinker and Engine. Thinker 
didn't drink,, which was unusual 
for a spacer, though typical of 
Thinker, and Engine couldn't. 



SPECIALIST

They listened while Thinker 
reeled off some astounding facts. 
From Eye's pictures of the planet's surface, Thinker had detected the presence of metallic 
construction. He put forth the 
alarming suggestion that these 
Pushers had constructed a mechanical civilization. 

"That's impossible," three of 
the Walls said flatly, and most 
of the Crew were inclined to 
agree with them. All the metal 
they had ever seen had been 
buried in the ground or lying 
around in worthless oxidized 
chunks. 

"Do you mean that they make 
things out of metal?" Talker demanded. "Out of just plain dead 
metal? What could they make?" 

"They couldn't make anything," Feeder said positively. 
"It would break down constantly. I mean metal doesn't know 
when it's weakening." 

But it seemed to be true. Eye 
magnified his" pictures, and everyone could see that the Pushers 
had made vast shelters, vehicles, 
and other articles from inanimate 
material. 

The reason for this was not 
readily apparent, but it wasn't a 
good sign. However, the really 
hard part was over. The Pusher 
planet had been found. All that 
remained was the relatively easy 
job of convincing a native Pusher, which shouldn't be too hard. 



Talker knew that cooperation 
was the keystone of the Galaxy, 
even among primitive peoples. 

The Crew decided not to land 
in a populated region. Of course, 
there was no reason not to expect a friendly greeting, but it 
was the job of a Contact Team 
to get in touch with them as a 
race. All they wanted was an 
individual. 

Accordingly, they picked out 
a sparsely populated land-mass, 
drifting in while that side of the 
planet was dark. 

They were able to locate a 
solitary Pusher almost at once. 

EYE adapted his vision to see 
in the dark, and they followed the Pusher's movements. 
He lay down, after a while, beside a small, fire. Thinker told 
them that this was a well-known 
resting habit of Pushers. 

Just before dawn, the Walls 
opened, and Feeder, Talker and 
Doctor came out. 

Feeder dashed forward and 
tapped the creature on the shoulder. Talker followed with a communication tendril. 

The Pusher opened his seeing . 
organs, blinked them, and made 
a movement with his eating organ. Then he leaped to his feet 
and started to run. 

The three Crew members were 
astounded. The Pusher hadn't 
even waited to find out what 



76 




 



the three of them wanted! 

Talker extended a filament 
rapidly, and caught the Pusher, 
fifty feet away, by a limb. The 
Pusher fell. 

"Treat him gently," Feeder 
said. "He might be startled by 
our appearance." He twitched his 
tendrils at the idea of a Pusher — 
one of the strangest sights in the 
Galaxy, with his multiple organs 
— being startled at someone else's 
appearance. 

Feeder and Doctor scurried to 
the fallen Pusher, picked him up 
and carried him back to the 
Ship. 

The Walls sealed again. They 
released the Pusher and prepared 
to talk. 

As soon as he was free, the 
Pusher sprang to his limbs and 
ran at the place where the Walls 
had sealed. He pounded against 
them frantically, his eating organ 
open and vibrating. 

"Stop that," the Wall said. He 
bulged, and the Pusher tumbled 
to the floor. Instantly, he jumped 
up and started to run forward. 

"Stop him," Talker said. "He 
might hurt himself." 

One of the Accumulators woke 
up enough to roll into the Pusher's path. The Pusher fell, got 
up again, and ran on. 

Talker had his filaments in the 
front of the Ship also, and he 
caught the Pusher in the bow. 
The Pusher started to tear at his 



tendrils, and Talker let go 
hastily. 

"Plug him into the communication system!" Feeder shouted. 
"Maybe we can reason with 
him!" 

Talker advanced a filament 
toward the Pusher's head, waving it in the universal sign of 
communication. But the Pusher 
continued his amazing behavior, 
jumping out of the way. He had 
a piece of metal in his hand and 
he was waving it frantically. 

"What do you think he's going 
to do with that?" Feeder asked. 
The Pusher started to attack the 
side of the Ship, pounding at 
one of the Walls. The Wall stiffened instinctively and the metal 
snapped. 

"Leave him alone," Talker 
said. "Give him a chance to 
calm down." 

rpALKER consulted with 
Thinker, but they couldn't 
decide what to do about the 
Pusher. He wouldn't accept communication. Every time Talker 
extended a filament, the Pusher 
showed all the signs of violent 
panic. Temporarily, it was an 
impasse. 

Thinker vetoed the plan of 
finding another Pusher on the 
planet. He considered this Pusher's behavior typical; nothing 
would be gained by approaching 
another. Also, a planet was sup


SPECI ALIST 



77 



posed to be contacted only by a 
Contact Team. 

If they couldn't communicate 
with this Pusher, they never 
would with another on the 
planet. 

"I think I know what the 
trouble is," Eye said. He crawled 
up on an Accumulator. "These 
Pushers have evolved a mechanical civilization. Consider for a 
minute how they went about it. 
They developed the use of their 
fingers, like Doctor, to shape 
metal. They utilized their seeing 
organs, like myself. And probably countless other organs." He 
paused for effect. 

"These Pushers have become 
unspecialized!" 

They argued over it for 
several hours. The Walls maintained that no intelligent creature could be unspecialized. It 
was unknown in the Galaxy. But 
the evidence was before them — 
The Pusher cities, their vehicles 
. . . This Pusher, exemplifying 
the rest, seemed capable of a 
multitude of things. 

He was able to do everything 
except Push! 

Thinker supplied a partial explanation. "This is not a primitive planet. It is relatively old 
and should have been in the Cooperation thousands of years 
ago. Since it was not, the Pushers 
upon it were robbed of their 
birthright. Their ability, their 



specialty, was to Push, but there 
was nothing to Push. Naturally, 
they have developed a deviant 
culture. 

"Exactly what this culture is, 
we can only guess. But on the 
basis of the evidence, there is 
reason to believe that these 
Pushers are — uncooperative." 

Thinker had a habit of uttering the most shattering statement 
in the quietest possible way. 

"It is entirely possible," 
Thinker went on inexorably, 
"that these Pushers will have 
nothing to do with us. In which 
case, our chances are approximately 283 to one against finding 
another Pusher planet." 

"We can't be sure he won't 
cooperate," Talker said, "until 
we get him into communication." 
He found it almost impossible to 
believe that any intelligent creature would refuse to cooperate 
willingly. 

"But how?" Feeder asked. 
They decided upon a course of 
action. Doctor walked slowly up 
to the Pusher, who backed away 
from him. In the meantime, 
Talker extended a filament outside the Ship, around, and in 
again, behind the Pusher. 

The Pusher backed against a 
Wall — and Talker shoved the 
filament through the Pusher's 
head, into the communication 
socket in the center of his brain. 

The Pusher collapsed. 



78 




 



WHEN he came to, Feeder 
and Doctor had to hold the 
Pusher's limbs, or he would have 
ripped out the communication 
line. Talker exercised his skill in 
learning the Pusher's language. 

It wasn't too hard. All Pusher 
languages were of the same family, and this was no exception. 
Talker was able to catch enough 
surface thoughts to form a pattern. 

He tried to communicate with 
the Pusher. 

The Pusher was silent. 

"I think he needs food," Feeder said. They remembered that 
it had been almost two days 
since they had taken the Pusher 
on board. Feeder worked up 
some standard Pusher food and 
offered it. 

"My God! A steak!" the Pusher said. 

The Crew cheered along Talker's communication circuits. The 
Pusher had said his first words! 

Talker examined the words 
and searched his memory. He 
knew about two hundred Pusher 
languages and many more simple 
variations. He found that this 
Pusher was speaking a cross of 
two Pusher tongues. 

After the Pusher had eaten, he 
looked around. Talker caught 
his thoughts and broadcast them 
to the Crew. 

The Pusher had a queer way 
of looking at the Ship. He saw 



it as a riot of colors. The walls 
undulated. In front of him was 
something resembling a gigantic 
spider, colored black and green, 
with his web running all over the 
Ship and into the heads of all the 
creatures. He saw Eye as a 
strange, naked little animal, 
something between a skinned 
rabbit and an egg yolk — whatever those things were. 

Talker was fascinated by the 
new perspective the Pusher's 
mind gave him. He had never 
seen things that way before. But 
now that the Pusher was pointing it out, Eye was a pretty 
funny-looking creature. 

They settled down to communication. 

"What in hell are you things?" 
the Pusher asked, much calmer 
now than he had been during 
the two days. "Why did you 
grab me? Have I gone nuts?" 

"No," Talker said, "you are 
not psychotic. We are a galactic 
trading ship. We were blown off 
our course by a storm and our 
Pusher was killed." 

"Well, what does that have to 
do with me?" 

"We would like you to join 
our crew," Talker said, "to be 
our new Pusher." 

r pHE Pusher thought it over 
after the situation was explained to him. Talker could 
catch the feeling of conflict in the 



SPECIALIST 



79 



Pusher's thoughts. He hadn't decided whether to accept this as a 
real situation or not. Finally, the 
Pusher decided that he wasn't 
crazy. 

"Look, boys," he said, "I don't 
know what you are or how this 
makes sense. I have to get out 
of here. I'm on a furlough, and 
if I don't get back soon, the U. S. 
Army's going to be very interested." 

Talker asked the Pusher to 
give him more information about 
"army," and he fed it to Thinker. 

"These Pushers engage in personal combat," was Thinker's 
conclusion. 

"But why?" Talker asked. 
Sadly he admitted to himself 
that Thinker might have been 
right; the Pusher didn't show 
many signs of willingness to cooperate. 

"I'd like to help you lads out," 
Pusher said, "but I've got a war 
to fight. Besides, I don't know 
where you get the idea that I 
could push anything this size. 
You'd need a whole division of 
tanks just to budge it." 

"Do you approve of this war?" 
Talker asked, getting a suggestion from Thinker. 

"Nobody likes war — not those 
who have to do the dying at 
least." 

"Then why do you fight it?" 
The Pusher made a gesture 
with his eating organ, which Eye 



picked up and sent to Thinker. 
"It's kill or be killed. You guys 
know what war is, don't you?" 

"We don't have any wars," 
Talker said. 

"You're lucky," the Pusher 
said bitterly. "We do. Plenty of 
them." 

"Of course," Talker said. He 
had the full explanation from 
Thinker now. "Would you like 
to end them?" 

"Of course I would." 

"Then come with us. Be our 
Pusher." 

The Pusher stood up and 
walked up to an Accumulator. 
He sat down on it and doubled 
the ends of his upper limbs. 

"How the hell can I stop all 
wars?" the Pusher demanded. 
"I'm just Private Dave Martinson. Even if I went to the big 
shots and told them — " 

"You won't have to," Talker 
said. "All you have to do is come 
with us. Push us to our base. 
Galactic will send a Contact 
Team to your planet. That will 
end your wars." 

"The hell you say," the Pusher 
replied. "You boys are stranded 
here, huh? Good enough. No 
monsters are going to take over 
Earth." 

T> EWILDEREDLY, Talker 
tried to understand the reasoning. Had he said something 
wrong? Was it possible that the 



80 




 



Pusher didn't understand him? 

"I thought you wanted to end 
wars," Talker said. 

"Sure I do. But I don't want 
anyone making us stop. I'm no 
traitor. I'd rather fight." 

"No one will make you stop. 
You just will stop because there 
will be no further need for fighting." 

"Do you know why we're 
fighting?" 

"It's obvious." 

"Yeah? What's your explanation?" 

"You Pushers have been separated from the main stream of 
the Galaxy," Talker explained. 
"You have your specialty — pushing — but nothing to Push. Accordingly, you have no real jobs. 
You play with things — metal, 
inanimate objects — but find no 
real satisfaction. Robbed of your 
true vocation, you fight from 
sheer frustration. 

"Once you find your place in 
the galactic Cooperation — and I 
assure you that it is ap important 
place — your fighting will stop. 
Why should you fight, which is 
an unnatural occupation, when 
you can Push? Also, your mechanical civilization will end, 
since there will be no need for 
it." 

The Pusher shook his head in 
what Talker guessed was a gesture of confusion. "What is this 
pushing?" 



Talker told him as best he 
could. Since the job was out of 
his scope, he had only a general 
idea of what a Pusher did. 

"You mean to say that that is 
what every Earthman should be 
doing?" 

"Of course," Talker said. "It is 
your great specialty." 

The Pusher thought about it 
for several minutes. "I think you 
want a physicist or a mentalist 
or something. I could never do 
anything like that. I'm a junior 
architect. And besides — well, it's 
difficult to explain." 

But Talker had already caught 
Pusher's objection. He saw a 
Pusher female in his thoughts. 
No, two, three. And he caught 
a feeling of loneliness, strangeness. The Pusher was filled with 
doubts. He was afraid. 

"When we reach galactic," 
Talker said, hoping it was the 
right thing, "you can meet other 
Pushers. Pusher females, too. All 
you Pushers look alike, so you 
should become friends with 
them. As far as loneliness in the 
Ship goes — it just doesn't exist. 
You don't understand the Cooperation yet. No one is lonely in 
the Cooperation." 

rr*HE Pusher was still consider ing the idea of there being 
other Pushers. Talker couldn't 
understand why he was so startled at that. The Galaxy was

filled with Pushers, Feeders, 
Talkers, and many other species, 
endlessly duplicated. 

"I can't believe that anybody 
could end all war," Pusher said. 
"How do I know you're not lying? I won't go." 

Talker felt as if he had been 
struck in the face. Thinker must 
have been right when he said 
these Pushers would be uncooperative. Was this going to be the 
end of Talker's career? Were he 
and the rest of the Crew going to 
spend the rest of their lives in 
space, because of the stupidity of 
a bunch of Pushers? 

Even thinking this, Talker was 
able to feel sorry for the Pusher. 
It must be terrible, he thought. 
Doubting, uncertain, never trusting anyone. If these Pushers 
didn't find their place in the Galaxy, they would exterminate 
themselves. Their place in the 
Cooperation was long overdue. 

"What can I do to convince 
you?" Talker asked. 

In despair, he opened all the 
circuits to the Pusher. He let the 
Pusher see Engine's good-natured 
gruffness, the devil - may - care 
humor of the Walls; he showed 
him Eye's poetic attempts, and 
Feeder's cocky good nature. He 
opened his own mind and showed 
the Pusher a picture of his home 
planet, his family, the tree he 
was planning to buy when he 
got home. 



The pictures told the story of 
all of them, from different planets, representing different ethics, 
united by a common bond — the 
galactic Cooperation. 

The Pusher watched it all in 
silence. 

After a while, he shook his 
head. The thought accompanying the gesture was uncertain, 
weak — but negative. 

Talker told the Walls to open. 
They did, and the Pusher looked 
at his own planet in amazement. 

"You may leave," Talker said. 
"Just remove the communication 
line and go." 

"What will you do?" 

"We will look for another 
Pusher planet." 

"Where? Mars? Venus?" 

"We don't know. All we can do 
is hope there is another in this 
region." 

The Pusher looked at the 
opening, then back at the Crew. 
He hesitated and his face screwed 
up in a grimace of indecision. 

"All that you showed me was 
true?" 

No answer was necessary. 

" A LL right," the Pusher said 
suddenly. "I'll go. I'm a 
damned fool, but I'll go. If this 
means what you say — it must 
mean what you say!" 

Talker saw that the agony of 
the Pusher's decision had forced 
him out of contact with reality.

He believed that he was back in 
a dream, where decisions are 
easy and unimportant. 

"There's just one little trouble," Pusher said with the lightness of hysteria. "Boys, I'll be 
hanged if I know how to Push. 
You said something about faster than-light? I can't even run the 
mile in an hour." 

"Of course you can Push," 
Talker assured him, hoping he 
was right. He knew what a Pusher's abilities were; but this one 
. . . "Just try it." 

"Sure," Pusher agreed. "I'll 
probably wake up out of this, 
anyhow." 

They sealed the ship for takeoff while Pusher talked to himself. 

"Funny," Pusher said. "I 
thought a camping trip would be 
a nice way to spend a furlough 
and all I do is get nightmares!" 

Engine boosted the Ship into 
the air. The Walls were sealed 
and Eye was guiding them away 
from the planet. 

"We're in clear space now," 
Talker said. Listening to Pusher, 
he hoped his mind hadn't cracked. "Eye and Thinker will give 
a direction, I'll transmit it to 
you, and you Push along it." 

"You're crazy," Pusher mumbled. "You must have the wrong 
planet. I wish you nightmares 
would go away." 

"You're in the Cooperation 



now," Talker said desperately. 
"There's the direction. Push!" 

The Pusher didn't do anything 
for a moment. He was slowly 
emerging from his fantasy, realizing that he wasn't in a dream, 
after all. He felt the Cooperation. 
Eye to Thinker, Thinker to 
Talker, Talker to Pusher, all intercoordinated with Walls, and 
with each other. 

"What is this?" Pusher asked. 
He felt the oneness of the Ship, 
the great warmth, the closeness 
achieved only in the Cooperation. 

He Pushed. 

Nothing happened. 

"Try again," Talker begged. 

¥>USHER searched his mind. 
-■- He found a deep well of 
doubt and fear. Staring into it, 
he saw his own tortured face. 

Thinker illuminated it for him. 

Pushers had lived with this 
doubt and fear for centuries. 
Pushers had fought through fear, 
killed through doubt. 

That was where the Pusher 
organ was! 

Martinson — specialist, Pusher 
— entered fully into the Crew, 
merged with them, threw mental 
arms around the shoulders of 
Thinker and Talker. 

Suddenly, the Ship shot forward at eight times the speed of 
light. It continued to accelerate.
