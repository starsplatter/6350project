A Gleeb for Earth By CHARLES SHAFHAUSER 


DEAR Editor: 
My 14 year old boy, 
Ronnie, is typing this 
letter for me because he can do 
it neater and use better grammar. 
I had to get in touch with somebody about this because if there 
is something to it, then somebody, everybody, is going to 
point finger at me, Ivan Smernda, and say, "Why didn't you 
warn us?" 

I could not go to the police because they are not too friendly 
to me because of some of my 
guests who frankly are stew 
bums. Also they might think I 
was on booze, too, or maybe the 
hops, and get my license revoked. 
I run a strictly legit hotel even 
though some of my guests might 
be down on their luck now and 
then. 

What really got me mixed up 
in this was the mysterious disappearance of two of my guests. 
They both took a powder last 
Wednesday morning. 

Now get this. In one room, that 
of Joe Binkle, which maybe is 
an alias, I find nothing but a suit 
of clothes, some butts and the 
letters I include here in same 
package. Binkle had only one 
suit. That I know. And this was 
it laying right in the middle of 
the room. Inside the coat was the 
vest, inside the vest the shirt, 
inside the shirt the underwear. 
The pants were up in the coat and 
inside of them was also the underwear. All this was buttoned 
up like Binkle had melted out of 
it and dripped through a crack in 
the floor. In a bureau drawer were 
the letters I told you about. 

Now. In the room right under 
Binkle's lived another stew bum 
that checked in Thursday . . . 
name Ed Smith, alias maybe, too. 
This guy was a real case. He 
brought with him a big mirror 
with a heavy bronze frame. Air


loom, he says. He pays a week in 
advance, staggers up the stairs 
to his room with the mirror and 
that's the last I see of him. 

In Smith's room on Wednesday 
I find only a suit of clothes, the 
same suit he wore when he came 
in. In the coat the vest, in the 
vest the shirt, in the shirt the 
underwear. Also in the pants. 
Also all in the middle of the 
floor. Against the far wall stands 
the frame of the mirror. Only the 
frame! 

WHAT a spot to be in! Now 
it might have been a gag. 
Sometimes these guys get funny 
ideas when they are on the stuff. 
But then I read the letters. This 
knocks me for a loop. They are 
all in different handwritings. All 
from different places. Stamps all 
legit, my kid says. India, China, 
England, everywhere. 

My kid, he reads. He Says it's 
no joke. He wants to call the 
cops or maybe some doctor. But 
I say no. He reads your magazine so he says write to you, send 
you the letters. You know what to 
do. Now you have them. Maybe 
you print. Whatever you do, Mr. 
Editor, remember my place, the 
Plaza Ritz Arms, is straight establishment. I don't drink. I 
never touch junk, not even aspirin. 

Yours very truly, 
Ivan Smernda

Mr. Joe Binkle 
Plaza Ritz Arms 
New York City 
Dear Joe: 

Greetings, greetings, greetings. 
Hold firm in your wretched projection, for tomorrow you will not 
be alone in the not-world. In two 
days I, Glmpauszn, will be born. 

Today I hang in our newly developed not-pod just within the 
mirror gateway, torn with the 
agony that we calculated must go 
with such tremendous wavelength 
fluctuations. I have attuned myself to a fetus within the body of 
a not-woman in the not-world. 
Already I am static and for hours 
have looked into this weird extension of the Universe with fear 
and trepidation. 

As soon as my stasis was 
achieved, I tried to contact you, 
but got no response. What could 
have diminished your powers of 
articulate wave interaction to 
make you incapable of receiving 
my messages and returning them? 
My wave went out to yours and 
found it, barely pulsing and surrounded with an impregnable chimera. 

Quickly, from the not -world vibrations about you, I learned the 
not-knowledge of your location. 
So I must communicate with you 
by what the not-world calls 
"mail" till we meet. For this pur


pose I must utilize the feeble vibrations of various not-people 
through whose inadequate articulation I will attempt to make my 
moves known to you. Each time 
I will pick a city other than the 
one I am in at the time. 

I, Glmpauszn, come equipped 
with powers evolved from your 
fragmentary reports before you 
ceased to vibrate to us and with 
a vast treasury of facts from indirect sources. Soon our tortured 
people will be free of the fearsome not-folk and I will be their 
Jiberator. You failed in your 
task, but I will try to get you off 
with light punishment when we 
return again. 

The hand that writes this letter 
is that of a boy in the not-city of 
Bombay in the not-country of 
India. He does not know he writes 
it.- Tomorrow it will be someone 
else. You must never know of my 
exact location, for the not-people 
might have access to the information. 

I must leave off now because 
the not-child is about to be born. 
When it is alone in the room, it 
will be spirited away and I will 
spring from the pod on the gateway into its crib and will be its 
exact vibrational likeness. 

I have tremendous powers. But 
the not-people must never know 
I am among them. This is the 
only way I could arrive in the 
room where the gateway lies 



96 




 



without arousing suspicion. I will 
grow up as the not-child in order 
that I might destroy the notpeople completely. 

All is well, only they shot this 
information file into my matrix 
too fast. I'm having a hard time 
sorting facts and make the right 
decision. Gezsltrysk, what a task! 

Farewell till later.

Dear Joe: 

Mnghjkl, fhfjgfhjklop phelnoprausynks. No. When I communicate with you, I see I must 
avoid those complexities of procedure for which there" are no 
terms in this language. There is 
no way of describing to you in 
not-language what I had to go 
through during the first moments 
of my birth. 

Now I know what difficulties 
you must have had with your 
limited equipment. These notpeople are unpredictable and 
strange. Their doctor came in and 
weighed me again the day after 
my birth. Consternation reigned 
when it was discovered I was ten 
pounds heavier. What difference 
could it possibly make? Many 
doctors then came in to see me. 
As they arrived hourly, they 
found me heavier and heavier. 
Naturally, since I am growing. 
This is part of my instructions. 



Mynot-mother (Gezsltrysk!) then 
burst into tears. The doctors conferred, threw up their hands and 
left. 

I learned the following day 
that the opposite component of 
my not-mother, my not-father, 
had been away riding on some 
conveyance during my birth. He 
was out on . . . what did they call 
it? Oh, yes, a bender. He did not 
arrive till three days after I was 
born. 

When I heard them say that 
he was straightening up to come 
see me, I made a special effort 
and grew marvelously in one afternoon. I was 36 not-world 
inches tall by evening. My notfather entered while I was standing by the crib examining a 
syringe the doctor had left behind. He stopped in his tracks on 
entering the room and seemed 
incapable of speech. 

Dredging into the treasury of 
knowledge I had come equipped 
with, I produced the proper 
phrase for occasions of this kind 
in the not -world. 

"Poppa," I said. 

This was the first use I had 
made of the so-called vocal cords 
that are now part of my extended 
matrix. The sound I emitted 
sounded low-pitched, guttural 
and penetrating even to myself. 
It must have jarred on my notfather's ears, for he turned and 
ran shouting from the room. 



A GLEEB FOR EARTH

They apprehended him on the 
stairs and I heard him babble 
something about my being a 
monster and no child of his. My 
not-mother appeared at the doorway and instead of being pleased 
at the progress of my growth, she 
fell down heavily. She made a 
distinct thump on the floor. 

This brought the rest of them 
on the run, so I climbed out the 
window and retreated across a 
nearby field. A prolonged search 
was launched, but I eluded them. 
What unpredictable beings! 

I reported my tremendous 
progress back to our world, including the cleverness by which 
I managed to escape my pursuers. I received a reply from 
Blgftury which, on careful analysis, seems to be small praise indeed. In fact, some of his phrases 
apparently contain veiled threats. 
But you know old Blgftury. He 
wanted to go on this expedition 
himself and it's his nature never 
to flatter anyone. 

From now on I will refer to 
not-people simply as people, 
dropping the qualifying preface 
except where comparisons must 
be made between this alleged 
world and our own. It is merely 
an offshoot of our primitive 
mythology when this was considered a spirit world, just as 
these people refer to our world as 
never-never land and other 
anomalies. But we learned other


wise, while they never have. 

New sensations crowd into my 
consciousness and I am having 
a hard time classifying them. 
Anyway, I shall carry on swiftly 
now to the inevitable climax in 
which I singlehanded will obliterate the terror of the not-world 
and return to our world a hero. 
I cannot understand your not 
replying to my letters. I have 
given you a box number. What 
could have happened to your vibrations?

June 15 
Dear Joe: 

I had tremendous difficulty 
getting a letter off to you this 
time. My process — original with 
myself, by the way — is to send 
out feeler vibrations for what 
these people call the psychic individual. Then I establish contact 
with him while he sleeps and 
compel him without his knowledge to translate my ideas into 
written language. He writes my 
letter and mails it to you. Of 
course, he has no awareness of 
what he has done. 

My first five tries were unfortunate. Each time I took control 
of an individual who could not 
read or write! Finally I found my 
man, but I fear his words are 
limited. Ah, well. I had great 
things to tell you about my prog


98 




 



ress, but I cannot convey even a 
hint of how I have accomplished 
these miracles through the thick 
skull of this incompetent. 

In simple terms then: I crept 
into a cave and slipped into a 
kind of sleep, directing my 
squhjkl ulytz & uhrytzg . . . no, 
it won't come out. Anyway, I 
grew overnight to the size of an 
average person here. 

As I said before, floods of impressions are driving into my 
xzbyl . . . my brain . . . from 
various nerve and sense areas and 
I am having a hard time classifying them. My one idea was to get 
to a chemist and acquire the 
stuff needed for the destruction 
of these people. 

Sunrise came as I expected. 
According to my catalog of 
information, the impressions 
aroused by it are of beauty. It 
took little conditioning for me 
finally to react in this manner. 
This is truly an efficient mechanism I inhabit. 

I gazed about me at the mixture of lights, forms and impressions. It was strange and . . . 
now I know . . . beautiful. However, I hurried immediately 
toward the nearest chemist. At 
the same time I looked up and 
all about me at the beauty. 

Soon an individual approached. 
I knew what to do from my information. I simply acted natural. You know, one of your 



earliest instructions was to realize 
that these people see nothing unusual in you if you do not let 
yourself believe they do. 

This individual I classified as 
a female of a singular variety 
here. Her hair was short, her 
upper torso clad in a woolen garment. She wore . . . what are 
they? . . . oh, yes, sneakers. My 
attention was diverted by a 
scream as I passed her. I stopped. 

The woman gesticulated and 
continued to scream. People hurried from nearby houses. I linked 
my hands behind me and 
watched the scene with an attitude of mild interest. They 
weren't interested in me, I told 
myself. But they were. 

I became alarmed, dived into 
a bush and used a mechanism 
that you unfortunately do not 
have — invisibility. I lay there and 
listened. 

"He was stark naked," the girl 
with the sneakers said. 

A figure I recognized as a police 
officer spoke to her. 

"Lizzy, you'll just have to keep 
these crackpot friends of yours 
out of this area." 

"But—" 

"No more buck-bathing, Lizzy," the officer ordered. "No more 
speeches in the Square. Not when 
it results in riots at five in the 
morning. Now where is your 
naked friend? I'm going to make 
an example of him."

That was it — I had forgotten 
clothes. There is only one answer 
to this oversight on my part. My 
mind is confused by the barrage 
of impressions that assault it. I 
must retire now and get them all 
classified. Beauty, pain, fear, 
hate, love, laughter. I don't know 
one from the other. I must feel 
each, become accustomed to it. 

The more I think about it, the 
more I realize that the information I have been given is very 
unrealistic. You have been inefficient, Joe. What will Blgftury 
and the others say of this? My 
great mission is impaired. Farewell, till I find a more intelligent 
mind so I can write you with 
more enlightenment.

Dear Joe: 

I received your first communication today. It baffles me. Do 
you greet me in the proper fringezone manner? No. Do you express 
joy, hope, pride, helpfulness at 
my arrival? No. You ask me for 
a loan of five bucks! 

It took me some time, culling 
my information catalog to come 
up with the correct variant of 
the slang term "buck." Is it possible that you are powerless even 
to provide yourself with the 
wherewithal to live in this inferior 
world? 



A reminder, please. You and I 
— I in particular — are now engaged in a struggle to free our 
world from the terrible, maiming 
intrusions of this not-world. 
Through many long gleebs, our 
people have lived a semi-terrorized existence while errant vibrations from this world ripped 
across the closely joined vibration 
flux, whose individual fluctuations make up our sentient population. 

Even our eminent, all-high 
Frequency himself has often been 
jeopardized by these people. The 
not-world and our world are like 
two baskets as you and I see 
them in our present forms. Baskets woven with the greatest intricacy, design and color; but 
baskets whose convex sides are 
joined by a thin fringe of filaments. Our world, on the vibrational plane, extends just a bit 
into this, the not-world. But being a world of higher vibration, 
it is ultimately tenuous to these 
gross peoples. While we vibrate 
only within a restricted plane because of our purer, more stable 
existence, these people radiate 
widely into our world. 

They even send what they call 
psychic reproductions of their 
own selves into ours. And most 
infamous of all, they sometimes 
are able to force some of our individuals over the fringe into their 
world temporarily, causing them 



100 




 



much agony and fright. 

The latter atrocity is perpetrated through what these people 
call mediums, spiritualists and 
other fatuous names. I intend to 
visit one of them at the first 
opportunity to see for myself. 

Meanwhile, as to you, I would 
offer a few words of advice. I 
picked them up while examining 
the "slang" portion of my information catalog which you unfortunately caused me to use. So, 
for the ultimate cause — in this, 
the penultimate adventure, and 
for the glory and peace of our 
world — shake a leg, bub. 
Straighten up and fly right. In 
short, get hep. 

As far as^he five bucks is concerned, no dice.

Dear Joe: 

Your letter was imponderable 
till I had thrashed through long 
passages in my information catalog that I had never imagined I 
would need. Biological functions 
and bodily processes which are 
labeled here "revolting" are used 
freely in your missive. You can 
be sure they are all being forwarded to Blgftury. If I were not 
involved in the most important 
part of my journey — completion 
of the weapon against the notworlders — I would come to New 



York immediately. You would 
rue that day, I assure you. 

Glmpauszn 

Boise, Idaho 
July 15 

Dear Joe: 

A great deal has happened to 
me since I wrote to you last. Systematically, I have tested each 
emotion and sensation listed in 
our catalog. I have been, as has 
been said in this world, like a 
reed bending before the winds of 
passion. In fact, I'm rather badly 
bent indeed. Ah! You'll pardon 
me, but I just took time for what 
is known quaintly in this tongue 
as a "hooker of red-eye" Ha! 
I've mastered even the vagaries 
of slang in the not-language . . . 
Ahhh! Pardon me again. I feel 
much better now. 

You see, Joe, as I attuned myself to the various impressions 
that constantly assaulted my 
mind through this body, I conditioned myself to react exactly as 
our information catalog instructed me to. 

Now it is all automatic, pure 
reflex. A sensation comes to me 
when I am burned; then I experience a burning pain. If the sensation is a tickle, I experience a 
tickle. 

This morning I have what is 
known medically as a syndrome 
. . . a group of symptoms popularly referred to as a hangover 



A GLEEB FOR EARTH 



101 



. . . Ahhh! Pardon me again. 
Strangely . . . now what was I 
saying? Oh, yes. Ha, ha. Strangely enough, the reactions that 
come easiest to the people in this 
world came most difficult to me. 
Money-love, for example. It is a 
great thing here, both among 
those who haven't got it and those 
who have. 

I went out and got plenty of 
money. I walked invisible into a 
bank and carried away piles of 
it. Then I sat and looked at it. 
I took the money to a remote 
room of the twenty room suite I 
have rented in the best hotel here 
in — no, sorry — and stared at it 
for hours. 

Nothing happened. I didn't 
love the stuff or feel one way or 
the other about it. Yet all around 
me people are actual^ killing one 
another for the love of it. 

Anyway . . . Ahhh. Pardon me. 
I got myself enough money to 
fill ten or fifteen rooms. By the 
end of the week I should have 
all eighteen spare rooms filled 
with money. If I don't love it 
then, I'll feel I have failed. This 
alcohol is taking effect now. 

Blgftury has been goading me 
for reports. To hell with his reports! I've got a lot more emotions to try, such as romantic 
love. I've been studying this phenomenon, along with other racial 
characteristics of these people, in 
the movies. This is the best place 



to see these people as they really 
are. They all go into the movie 
houses and there do homage to 
their own images. Very quaint 
type of idolatry. 

Love. Ha! What an adventure 
this is becoming. . 

By the way, Joe, I'm forwarding that five dollars. You see, it 
won't cost me anything. It'll come 
out of the pocket of the idiot 
who's writing this letter. Pretty 
shrewd of me, eh? 

I'm going out and look at that 
money again. I think I'm at last 
learning to love it, though not as 
much as I admire liquor. Well, 
one simply must persevere, I always say. 

CHmpauszn 

Penobscot, Maine 
July 20 

Dear Joe: 

Now you tell me not to drink 
alcohol. Why not? You never 
mentioned it in any of your vibrations to us, gleebs ago, when 
you first came across to this 
world. It will stint my powers? 
Nonsense! Already I have had a 
quart of the liquid today. I feel 
wonderful. Get that? I actually 
feel wonderful, in spite of this 
miserable imitation of a body. 

There are long hours during 
which I am so well-integrated 
into this body and this world that 
I almost consider myself a member of it. Now I can function 



102 




 



efficiently. I sent Blgftury some 
long reports today outlining my 
experiments in the realm of 
chemistry where we must finally 
defeat these people. Of course, I 
haven't made the experiments 
yet, but I will. This is not deceit, 
merely realistic anticipation of 
the inevitable. Anyway, what the 
old xbyzrt doesn't know won't 
muss his vibrations. 

I went to what they call a 
nightclub here and picked out a 
blonde-haired woman, the kind 
that the books say men prefer. 
She was attracted to me instantly. 
After all, the body I have devised 
is perfect in every detail . . . 
actually a not-world ideal. 

I didn't lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities. I 
remember distinctly that just as 
I stooped to pick Up a large roll 
of money I had dropped, her eyes 
met mine and in them I could see 
her admiration. We went to my 
suite and I showed her one of the 
money rooms. Would you believe 
it? She actually took off her shoes 
and ran around through the 
money in her bare feet! Then we 
kissed. 

Concealed in the dermis of the 
lips are tiny, highly sensitized 
nerve ends which send sensations 
to the brain. The brain interprets 
these impulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in the adrenals on the ends 
of the kidneys increases and an 



enlivening of the -entire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt 
the beginnings of love. 

I sat her down on a pile of 
money and kissed her again. 
Again the tingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myself quickly. 

Now in all the motion pictures 
— true representations of life and 
love in this world — the man with 
a lot of money or virtue kisses 
the girl and tries to induce her to 
do something biological. She 
then refuses. This pleases both of 
them, for he wanted her to refuse. 
She, in turn, wanted him to want 
her, but also wanted to prevent 
him so that he would have a high 
opinion of her. Do I make myself 
clear? 

I kissed the blonde girl and 
gave her to understand what I 
then wanted. Well, you can imagine my surprise when she said 
yes! So I had failed. I had not 
found love. 

I became so abstracted by this 
problem that the blonde girl fell 
asleep. I thoughtfully drank 
quantities of excellent alcohol 
called gin and didn't even notice 
when the blonde girl left. 

I am now beginning to feel the 
effects of this alcohol again. Ha. 
Don't I wish old Blgftury were 
here in the vibrational pattern of 
an olive? I'd get the blonde in 
and have her eat him out of a 
Martini. That is a gin mixture.

I think I'll get a hot report off 
to the old so-and-so right now. 
It'll take him a gleeb to figure 
this one out. I'll tell him I'm 
setting up an atomic reactor in 
the sewage systems here and that 
all we have to do is activate it 
and all the not-people will die of 
chain asphyxiation. 

Boy, what an easy job this 
turned out to be. It's just a vacation. Joe, you old gold-bricker, 
imagine you here all these gleebs 
living off the fat of the land. Yak, 
yak. Affectionately.

July 25 

Dear Joe: 

All is lost unless we work 
swiftly. I received your revealing 
letter the morning after having 
a terrible experience of my own. 
I drank a lot of gin for two days 
and then decided to go to one 
of these seance things. 

Somewhere along the way I 
picked up a red-headed girl. 
When we got to the darkened 
seance room, I took the redhead 
into a corner and continued my 
investigations into the realm of 
love. I failed again because she 
said yes immediately. 

The nerves of my dermis were 
working over time when suddenly 
I had the most frightening expedience of my life. Now I know 
what a horror these people really 



are to our world. 

The medium had turned out 
all the lights. He said there was 
a strong psychic influence in the 
room somewhere. That was me, 
of course, but I was too busy 
with the redhead to notice. 

Anyway, Mrs. Somebody 
wanted to make contact with 
her paternal grandmother, Lucy, 
from the beyond. The medium 
went into his act. He concentrated and sweated and suddenly 
something began to take form in 
the room. The best way to describe it in not-world language 
is a white, shapeless cascade of 
light. 

Mrs. Somebody reared to her 
feet and screeched, "Grandma 
Lucy!" Then I really took notice. 

Grandma Lucy, nothing! This 
medium had actually brought 
Blgftury partially across the vibration barrier. He must have 
been vibrating in the fringe area 
and got caught in the works. Did 
he look mad! His zyhku was open 
and his btgrimms were down. 

Worst of all, he saw me. 
Looked right at me with an unbelievable pattern of pain, anger, 
fear and amazement in his matrix. Me and the redhead. 

Then comes your letter today 
telling of the fate that befell you 
as a result of drinking alcohol. 
Our wrenchingly attuned faculties in these not-world bodies 



104 




 



need the loathsome drug to escape from the reality of notreality. It's true./ I cannot do 
without it now. The day is only 
half over and I have consumed 
a quart and a half. And it is dulling all my powers as it has practically obliterated yours. I can't 
even become invisible any more. 

I must find the formula that 
will wipe out the not-world men 
quickly. 

Quickly!

Dear Joe: 

This telepathic control becomes 
more difficult every time. I must 
pick closer points of communication soon. I have nothing to 
report but failure. I bought a ton 
of equipment and went to work 
on the formula that is half complete in my instructions. Six of 
my hotel rooms were filled with 
tubes, pipes and apparatus of all 
kinds. 

I had got my mechanism as 
close to perfect as possible when 
I realized that, in my befuddled 
condition, I had set off a reaction 
that inevitably would result in 
an explosion. I had to leave there 
immediately, but I could not create suspicion. The management 
was not aware of the nature of 
my activities. 

I moved swiftly. I could not 



afford time to bring my baggage. 
I stuffed as much money into my 
pockets as I could and then sauntered into the hotel lobby. Assuming my most casual air, I told the 
manager I was checking out. 
Naturally he was stunned since T 
was his best customer. 

"But why, sir?" he asked plaintively. 

I was baffled. What could I tell 
him? 

"Don't you like the rooms?" 
he persisted. "Isn't the service 
good?" 

"It's the rooms," I told. him. 
"They're — they're — " 

"They're what?" he wanted to 
know. 

"They're not safe." 

"Not safe? But that is ridiculous. This hotel is . . ." 

At this point the blast came. 
My nerves were a wreck from 
the alcohol. 

"See?" I screamed. "Not safe. 
I knew they were going to blow 
up!" 

He stood paralyzed as I ran 
from the lobby. Oh, well, never 
say die. Another day, another hotel. I swear I'm even beginning 
to think like the not-men, curse 
them.

I have it! It is done! In spite 



A GLEEB FOR EARTH 



105 



of the alcohol, in spite of Blgftury's niggling criticism, I have 
succeeded. I now have developed 
a form of mold, somewhat similar 
to the antibiotics of this world, 
that, transmitted to the human 
organism, will cause a disease 
whose end will be swift and fatal. 

First the brain will dissolve and 
then the body will fall apart. 
Nothing in this world can stop 
the spread of it once it is loose. 
Absolutely nothing. 

We must use care. Stock in as 
much gin as you are able. I will 
bring with me all that I can. 
Meanwhile I must return to my 
original place of birth into this 
world of horrors. There I will 
secure the gateway, a large mirror, the vibrational point at 
which we shall meet and slowly 
climb the frequency scale to 
emerge into our own beautiful, 
now secure world. You and I together, Joe, conquerors, liberators. 

You say you eat little and drink 



as much as you - can. The same 
with me. Even in this revolting 
world I am a sad sight. My notworld senses falter. This is the 
last letter. Tomorrow I come 
with the gateway. When the gin 
is gone, we will plant the mold in 
the hotel where you live. 

In only a single gleeb it will 
begin to work. The men of this 
queer world will be no more. But 
we can't say we didn't have some 
fun, can we, Joe? 

And just let Blgftury make one 
crack. Just one xyzprlt. I'll have 
hgutry before the ghjdksla!

Dear Editor: 

These guys might be queer 
drunk hopheads. But if not? If 
soon brain dissolve, body fall 
apart, how long have we got? 
Please, anybody who knows answer, write to me — Ivan Smernda, Plaza Ritz Arms — how long is 
a gleeb?
