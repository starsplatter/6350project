CUEFFEF ON PROGREFF 



TN the year 2034, traffic experts 
predict, automobiles will outnumber people. 

That recent news item was 
printed as practically a sure bet, 
since it was done by experts dealing with hard facts. 

If it had appeared as science 
fiction, the likelihood is that it 
would not have caused glee 
among car manufacturers, oil refiners, mechanics, and dismay 
among drivers, traffic cops and 
highway planners. 

There must, after all, be a 
great difference between statistical analysis and fiction exploring 
possibilities, which is what science fiction does. 

Actually, the traffic experts 
used exactly the methods of any 
writer of science fiction: 

They gave top priority to a 
coupled trend — population 
growth and increased ownership 
of cars — to produce an intelligible extrapolation. 

If this prediction had been submitted to me as the basis of a 
story, however, here are the questions I'd want taken care of in a 
logical and convincing way: 
• How is it that nothing has replaced the automobile long before 
2034? As a means of transportation, it's far from satisfactory, 
being wasteful of fuel, space, 
metals, roads, labor and lives. 



• Will fuel and materials hold 
out to that extent? It's not possible unless a cheaper and more 
plentiful fuel is used, and metals 
are replaced by plastics. 

• Since the driving and parking 
problems would be even more of 
a headache than now, is it reasonable to expect people to buy 
more and more cars? Why? How 
are these problems solved? For 
they must be solved or the majority would rather not own cars. 

• Automobiles will outnumber 
people where in 2034? 

• To what extent? 

• With what results in the lives 
of car owners, appearance of city 
and countryside, counter-advertising of competitive products to 
pull away sales, counter-counteradvertising to keep up sales of 
cars? 

And there you have an approximate notion of the way a theme' 
should be worked out in science 
fiction. Handled routinely, it 
would probably become a sad 
little tale of a housewife afraid 
that her husband will be in an 
accident on the grotesquely murderous highways, and he would, 
of course; or a wild rebellion of 
pedestrians against the tyranny 
of the automobile autocracy. A 
more thoughtful writer would 
have his characters try to get 
along in such a congested society.

Whoever wrote it, though, 
would be faced with the need to 
guess beyond present knowledge, 
as the literature of surmise has 
always had to do. 

You'd expect an expert to anticipate developments in his field, 
but nobody, however trained and 
ingenious, can foresee the shook 
discoveries that explode so 
abruptly, with no prior warning, 
on society — steam power, bacteriology, radioactivity, internal 
combustion, antibiotics — and 
with such violence that civilization is shot ahead as if out of a 
gun. 

That applies only to invention, 
a tough enough matter. But how 
about customs, attitudes, modes 
of life? We're writing of civilizations millenia away, and yet the 
gap between the 18th Century 
and today is almost unthinkable. 
This is how our age might have 
looked to a writer of that time: 

"By ftage to Bofton, which 
great diftance waf covered at an 
aftonifhing 15 milef an hour. Our 
driver ftated that thif if accomplifhed by breeding horfef of 
great fpeed and endurance. 

"The peftilence in Bofton caufed by miafmic air haf been erafed 
in "a moft ingeniouf manner: 
Trained falconf haraff leff predatory birdf into beating their wingf 
over the city, thuf difpelling the 
noxiouf atmofphere." 

We don't use the antique "S" 



any longer, but there were other 
customs equally inviolable to the 
hypothetical 18th Century writer : 

• He poured away what we call 
tea and ate the leaves with melted 
butter. 

• He enjoyed chocolate-covered 
sausages. 

• He paid the postage on the 
mail he received. 

• His marriage was arranged for 
him — an economic matter because a family was a financial 
asset. 

• When he didn't pay his debts, 
he went to prison. 

• If he couldn't afford tutors, his 
children remained illiterate. 

• He knew the future would be 
different, but he expected to be 
able to recognize it if he should 
somehow see it. He was wrong, 
obviously. 

T^kOES good science fiction, 
then, pretend to describe the 
actual future? No, certainly not. . 
Anyone who thinks so is missing 
the point — like an engineer trying to harness the energy of noise makers at a New Year's party. 

We're having fun with ideas, 
making first this one and then 
that predominant just to see what 
might happen if. 

In 2034, I 'predict, traffic experts will outnumber all cars and 
car owners. Bet I can "prove" it, 
too!

WHEREVER YOU 



Even today machinery can be repaired with hairpins and kept 
running with a kick— and harder kicks will mean more power! 



MATT refused to believe it. 
Vacant incredulity paralyzed him for a moment 
as he stared after the fleeing, 
bounding tire. Then, with a sudden release, he sprinted after it. 

"Stop!" he yelled futilely. 
"Stop, damn it!" 

With what seemed like sadistic 
glee, the tire bounced high in 
the air and landed going faster 
than ever. Matt pounded down 
the hot dusty road for a hundred 
yards before he pulled up even 
with it. He knocked it over on its 



side. The tire lay there, spinning 
and frustrate, like a turtle on its 
back. Matt glared at it suspiciously. Sweat trickled down his neck. 

A tinkling of little silver bells. 
Laughter? Matt looked up quickly, angrily. The woods were thin 
along the top of this Ozark ridge. 
Descending to the lake, sparkling cool and blue far below, they 
grew thicker, but the only one 
near was the young girl shuffling 
through the dust several hundred 
yards beyond the crippled car. 
And her head was bent down to 



4 




 



TN shimmering heat waves and 
a slowly settling haze of red 
dust, he righted the tire and began to roll it back toward the 
green Ford with one bare metal 
wheel drum pointing upward at 
a slight angle. The tire rolled 
easily, as if it repented its brief 
dash for freedom, but it was a 
dirty job and Mart's hands and 
clothes were soiled red when he 
reached the car. 

With one hand clutching the 
tire, Matt studied the road for 
a moment. He could have sworn 
that he had stopped on one of the 
few level stretches in these hills, 
but the tire had straightened up 
from the side of the car and 
started rolling as If the car were 
parked on a steep incline. 

Matt reflected bitterly on the 
luck that had turned a slow leak 
into a flat only twenty-five miles 
from the cabin. It couldn't have 
happened on the highway, ten 
miles back, where he'd have been 
able to pull into a service station. 
No, it had to wait until he 
couldn't get out of this rutted cow 
track. The tire's escapade had 
been only the most recent of a 
series of annoyances and irritations to which bruised shins and 
scraped knuckles were painful 
affidavits. 

He sighed. After all, he had 
wanted isolation. Guy's offer of a 
hunting cabin in which to finish 
his thesis had seemed like a god


send at the time, but now Matt 
wasn't so certain. If this was a 
fair sample, Matt was beginning 
to see how much of his time would 
be wasted just on the problems 
of existence. 

Cautiously, Matt rolled the tire 
to the rear of the car, laid it carefully on its side, and completed 
pulling the spare from the trunk. 
Warily, he maneuvered the spare 
to the left rear wheel, knelt, lifted 
it, fitted it over the bolts, and 
stepped back. He sighed again, 
but this time with relief. 

Kling-ng! Klang! Rattle! 

Matt hastily looked down. His 
foot was at least two inches from 
the hub cap, but it was rocking 
now, empty. Matt saw the last 
nut roll under the car. 

Matt's swearing was vigorous, 
systematic, and exhaustive. It 
concerned itself chiefly with the 
perversity of inanimate objects. 

There was something about 
machines and the things they 
made which was basically alien 
to the human spirit. They might 
disguise themselves for a time as 
willing slaves, but eventually, inevitably, they turned against their 
masters. At the psychological 
moment, they rebelled. 

Or perhaps it was the difference in people. For some people, 
things always went wrong — their 
cakes fell; their lumber split; their 
golf balls sliced into the rough. 
Others established a mysterious 



6 




 



sympathy with their tools. 

Luck? Skill? Coordination? Experience? 

It was, he felt, something more 
conscious and malignant. 

T*J"ATT remembered a neardisastrous brush with chemistry; he had barely passed 
qualitative analysis. For him the 
tests had been worse than useless. 
Faithfully he had gone through 
every step of the endless ritual: 
precipitate, filter, dissolve, precipitate . . . And then he would 
take his painfully secured, neatly 
written results to — what was his 
name? — Wadsworth, and the little 
chemistry professor would study 
his analysis and look up, frowning. 

"Didn't you find any whatyoumaycallit oxide?" he would ask. 

"Whatyoumaycallit oxide?" 
Startled. "Oh, there wasn't any 
whatyoumaycallit oxide." 

And Wadsworth would make a 
simple test and, sure enough, 
there would be the whatyoumaycallit oxide. 

There was the inexplicably 
misshapen gear Matt had made 
on the milling machine, the drafting pen that would not draw a 
smooth line no matter how much 
he sanded the point . . . 

It had convinced Matt that his 
hands were too clumsy to belong 
to an engineer. He had transferred 
his ambitions to a field where 



tools were less tangible. Now he 
wondered. 

Kobolds? Accident prones? 

Some time he would have to 
write it up. It would make a 
good paper for the Journal of — 

Laughter! This time there was 
no possible doubt. It came from 
right behind him. 

Matt whirled. The girl stood 
there, hugging her ribs to keep 
the laughter in. She was a young 
little thing, not much over five 
feet tall, in a shapeless, faded, 
blue dress. Her feet were small 
and bare and dirty. Her hair, in 
long braids, was mouse-colored. 
Her pale face was saved from 
plainness only by her large, blue 
eyes. 

Matt flushed. "What the devil 
are you laughing at?" 

"You!" she got out between 
chuckles. "Whyn't you get a 
horse?" 

"Did that remark just arrive 
here?" 

He swallowed his irritation, 
turned, and got down on his 
hands and knees to peer under 
the car. One by one he gathered 
up the nuts, but the last one, 
inevitably, was out of reach. 
Sweating, he crawled all the way 
under. 

TJPTHEN he came out, the girl 
was still there. "What are 
you waiting for?" he asked bitingly. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE

"Nothin'." But she stood with 
her feet planted firmly in the red 
dust. 

Kibitzers annoyed Matt, but 
he couldn't think of anything to 
do about it. He twirled the nuts 
onto the bolts and tightened them 
up, his neck itching. It might 
have been the effect of sweat and 
dust, but he was not going to 
give the girl the satisfaction of 
seeing him rub it. That annoyed 
him even more. He tapped the 
hub cap into place and stood up. 

"Why don't you go home?" he 
asked sourly. • 

"Cain't," she said. 

He went to the rear of the car 
and released the jack. "Why not?" 

"I run away." Her voice was 
quietly tragic. 

Matt turned to look at her. 
Her blue eyes were large and 
moist. As he watched, a single 
tear gathered and traced a muddy 
path down her cheek. 

Matt hardened his heart. 
"Tough." He picked up the flat 
and stuffed it into the trunk and 
slammed the lid. The sun was 
getting lower, and on this forgotten lane to nowhere it might 
take him the better part of an 
hour to drive the twenty-five 
miles. 

He slid into the driver's seat 
and punched the starter button. 
After one last look at the forlorn 
little figure in the middle of the 
road, he shook his head savagely 



and let in the clutch. 

"Mister! Hey, mister!" 

He slammed on the brakes and 
stuck his head out the window. 
"Now what do you want?" 

"Nothin'," she said mournfully. 
"Only you forgot your jack." 

Matt jammed the gear shift 
into reverse and backed up rapidly. Silently, he got out, picked up 
the jack, opened the trunk, tossed 
in the jack, slammed the lid. But 
as he brushed past her again, he 
hesitated. "Where are you going?" 

"No place," she said. 

"What do you mean 'no place'? 
Don't you have any relatives?" 
She shook her head. "Friends?" 
he asked hopefully. She shook her 
head again. "All right, then, go on 
home!" 

He slid into the car and banged 
the door. She was not his concern. 
The car jerked into motion. No 
doubt she would go home when 
she got hungry enough. He shifted 
into second, grinding the gears. 
Even if she didn't, someone would 
take her in. After all, he was no 
welfare agency. 

He grudgingly slowed, then 
angrily backed up and skidded 
to a stop beside the girl. 

"Get in," he said. 

rpRYING to keep the car out 
of the ruts was trouble enough, 
but the girl jumped up and down 
on the seat beside him, squealing 
happily.

"Careful of those notes," he 
said, indicating the bulging manila folders on the seat between 
them. "There's over a year's work 
in those." 

Her eyes were wide as she 
watched him place the folders in 
the back seat on top of the portable typewriter that rested between the twenty-pound sack of 
flour and the case of eggs. 

"A year's work?" she echoed 
wonderingly. 

"Notes. For the thesis I'm going to write." 

"You write stories?" 

"A research paper I have to do 
to get my degree." He glanced 
at her blank expression and then 
looked back at the road. "It's 
called," he said with a nasty 
superior smile, " 'The Psychodynamics of Witchcraft, with Special Reference to the Salem Trials 
of 1692.' " 

"Oh," she said wisely. 
"Witches." As if she knew all 
about witches. 

Matt felt unreasonably annoyed. "All right, where do you 
live?" 

She stopped bouncing and got 
very quiet. "I cain't go home." 

"Why not?" he demanded. 
"And don't tell me 'I run away,' " 
he imitated nasally. 

"Paw'd beat me again. He'd 
purty nigh skin me alive, I guess." 

"You mean he hits you?" 

"He don't use his fists — not 



often. He uses his belt mostly. 
Look." She pulled up the hem of 
her dress and the leg of a pair of 
baggy drawers that appeared to 
be made from some kind of sacking. 

Matt looked quickly and 
glanced away. Across the back of 
one thigh was an ugly dark bruise. 
But the leg seemed unusually well 
rounded for a girl so small and 
young. Matt frowned thoughtfully. Did girls in the hills mature 
that early? 

He cleared his throat. "Why 
does he do that?" 

"He's just mean." 

"He must have some reason." 

"Well," she said thoughtfully, 
"he beats me when he's drunk 
'cause he's drunk, and he beats 
me when he's sober 'cause he ain't 
drunk. That covers it mostly." 

"But what does he say?" 

She glanced at him shyly. "Oh, 
I cain't repeat it." 

"I mean what does he want you 
to do?" 

"Oh, that!" She brooded over it. 
"He thinks I ought to get married. He wants me to catch some 
strong young feller who'll do the 
work when he moves in with us. 
A gal don't bring in no money, 
he says, leastwise not a good one. 
That kind only eats and wants 
things." 

"Married?" Matt said. "But 
you're much too young to get 
married." 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE

OHE glanced at him out of the 
^ corner of her eye. "I'm sixteen," she said. "Most girls my 
age got a couple of young 'uns. 
One, anyways." 

Matt looked at her sharply. 
Sixteen? It seemed impossible. 
The dress was shapeless enough 
to hide almost anything — but sixteen! Then he remembered the 
thigh. 

She frowned. "Get married, get 
married! You'd think I didn't 
want to get married. 'Tain't my 
fault no feller wants me." 

"I can't understand that," Matt 
said sarcastically. 

She smiled at him. "You're 
nice." 

She looked almost pretty when 
she smiled. For a hill girl. 

"What seems to be the 
trouble?" Matt asked hurriedly. 

"Partly Paw," she said. "No 
one'd want to have him around. 
But mostly I guess I'm just unlucky." She sighed. "One feller I 
went with purty near a year. He 
busted his leg. Another nigh 
drownded when he fell in the lake. 
Don't seem right they should 
blame me, even if we did have 
words." 

"Blame you?" 

She nodded vigorously. "Them 
as don't hate me say it's courtin' 
disaster 'stead of a gal. The others 
weren't so nice. Fellers stopped 
comin'. One of 'em said he'd 
rather marry up with a cata


mount. You married, Mister — 
Mister—?" 

"Matthew Wright. No, I'm not 
married." 

She nodded thoughtfully. 
"Wright. Abigail Wright. That's 
purty." 

"Abigail Wright?" 

"Did I say that? Now, ain't 
that funny? My name's Jenkins." 

Matt gulped. "You're going 
home," he said with unshakable 
conviction. "You can tell me how 
to get there or you can climb 
out of the car right now." 

"But Paw—" 

"Where the devil did you think 
I was taking you?" 

"Wherever you're going," she 
said, wide-eyed. 

"For God's sake, you can't go 
with me! It wouldn't be decent." 

"Why not?" she asked innocently. 

In silence, Matt began to apply 
the brakes. 

"All right," she sighed. She 
wore an expression the early 
Christians must have worn before they were marched into the 
arena. "Turn right at the next 
cross road." 

/CHICKENS scattered in front 
^ of the wheels, fluttering and 
squawking; pigs squealed in a pen 
beside the house. Matt stopped 
in front of the shanty, appalled. 
If the two rooms and sagging 
porch had ever known paint, they 



10 




 



had enjoyed only a nodding acquaintance, and that a generation 
before. 

A large brooding figure sat on 
the porch, rocking slowly in a 
rickety chair. He was dark, with 
a full black beard and a tall head 
of hair. 

"That's Paw," Abigail whispered in fright. 

Matt waited uneasily, but the 
broad figure of her father kept on 
rocking as if strangers brought 
back his daughter every day. 
Maybe they do, Matt thought 
with irritation. 

"Well," he said nervously, "here 
you are." 

"I cain't get out," Abigail said. 
"Not till I find out if Paw's goih' 
to whale me. Go talk to him. See 
if he's mad at me." 

"Not me," Matt stated with 
certainty, glancing again at the 
big, black figure rocking slowly, 
ominously silent. "I've done my 
duty in bringing you home. 
Good-by. I won't say it's been a 
pleasure knowing you." 

"You're nice and mighty hand- ' 
some. I'd hate to tell Paw you'd 
taken advantage of me. He's a 
terror when he's riled." 

For one horrified moment, Matt 
stared at Abigail. Then, as she 
opened her mouth, he opened the 
door and stepped out. Slowly he 
walked up to the porch and put 
one foot on its uneven edge. 

"Uh," he said. "I met your 



daughter on the road." 

Jenkins kept on rocking. 

"She'd run away," Matt went 
on. 

Jenkins was silent. Matt studied 
the portion of Jenkins's face that 
wasn't covered with hair. There 
wasn't much of it, but what there 
was Matt didn't like. 

"I brought her back," Matt 
finished desperately. 

Jenkins rocked and said nothing. Matt spun around and 
walked quickly back to the car. 
He went around to the window 
where Abigail sat. He reached 
through the window, opened the 
glove compartment, and drew out 
a full pint bottle. 

"Remind me," he said, "never 
to see you again." He marched 
back to the porch. "Care for a 
little drink?" 

/"kNE large hand reached but, 

smothered the pint, and I 
brought it close to faded blue 
overalls. The cap was twisted off 
by the other hand. The bottle 
was tilted toward the unpainted 
porch ceiling as soon as the neck 
disappeared into the matted 
whiskers. The bottle gurgled. 
When it was lowered, it was only 
half full. 

"Weak," the beard said. But 
the hand that held the bottle held 
it tight. 

"I brought your daughter 
back," Matt said, starting again. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



11 



"Why?" he asked. 

"She had no place to go. I 
mean — after all, this is her home." 

"She run away," the beard said. 
Matt found the experience extremely unnerving. 

"Look, Mr. Jenkins, I realize 
that teen-age daughters can be 
a nuisance, and after meeting 
your daughter I think I can understand how you feel. Still in 
all, she is your daughter." 

"Got my doubts." 

Matt gulped and tried once 
more. "A happy family demands 
a lot of compromise, give-andtake on both sides. Your daughter 
may have given you good cause 
to lose your temper, but beating 
a child is never sound psychology. 
Now if you — " 

"Beat her?" Jenkins rose from 
his chair. It was an awesome 
thing, like Neptune rising out of 
the sea in all his majesty, gigantic, 
I bearded, and powerful. Even subtracting the height of the porch, 
Jenkins loomed several inches 
over Matt's near six feet. "Never 
laid a hand to her. Dassn't." 

My God, thought Matt, the 
man is trembling! 

"Come in here," said Jenkins. 
He waved the pint toward the 
open door, a dark rectangle. 

Uneasily, Matt walked into the 
room. Under his feet, things 
gritted and cracked. 

Jenkins lit a kerosene lamp and 
turned it up. The room was a 



shambles. Broken dishes littered 
the floor. Wooden chairs were 
smashed and splintered. In the 
center of the room, a table on its 
back waved three rough legs helplessly in the air; the fourth leg 
sagged pitifully from its socket. 

"She did this?" Matt asked 
weakly. 

"This ain't nothin'." Jenkins' 
voice quavered; it was a terrible 
sound to come from that massive 
frame. "You should see the other 
room." 

"But how? I mean why?" 

"1 ain't a-sayin' Ab done it," 
Jenkins said, shaking his head. 
His beard wobbled near Matt's 
nose. "But when she gets onhappy, things happen. And she 
was powerful onhappy when that 
Duncan boy tol' her he wan't 
comin' back. Them chairs come 
up from the floor and slam down. 
That table went dancin' round 
the room till it fell to pieces. 
Then dishes come a-flyin' through 
the air. Look!" 

His voice was full of self-pity 
as he turned his head around and 
parted his long, matted hair. On 
the back of his head was a large, 
red swelling. "I hate to think 
what happened to that Duncan 
boy." 

TTE shook his head sorrowfully. 

"Now, mister, I guess I got 
ever' right to lay my hand to that 
gal. Ain't I?" he demanded fierce

ly, but his voice broke. 

Matt stared at him blankly. 

"But whop her? Me? I sooner 
stick my hand in a nest of 
rattlers." 

"You mean to say that those 
things happened all by themselves?" 

"That's what I said. I guess it 
kinder sticks in your craw. 
Wouldn't have believe it myself, 
even seein' it and feelin' it — " he 
rubbed the back of his head — "if 
it ain't happen afore. Funny 
things happen around Ab, ever 
since she started fillin' out, fivesix year ago." 

"But she's only sixteen," Matt 
objected. 

"Sixteen?" Jenkins glanced 
warily around the room and out 
the door toward the car. He lowered his voice to a harsh whisper.. 
"Don't let on I tol' you, but Ab 
alius was a fibber. She's past 
eighteen!" 

From a shelf, a single unbroken 
dish crashed to the floor at Jenkins' feet. He jumped and began 
to shake. 

"See?" he whispered plaintively. 

"It fell," Matt said. 

"She's witched." Jenkins took 
a feverish swallow from the bottle. 
"Maybe I ain't been a good Paw 
to her. Ever since her Maw died, 
she run wild and got all kinda 
queer notions. 'Taint alius been 
bad. For years I ain't had to go 



fer water. That barrel by the 
porch is alius filled. But ever 
since she got to the courtin' age 
and started bein' disappointed in 
fellers round about, she been 
mighty hard to live with. No 
one'll come nigh the place. And 
things keep a-movin' and a-jumpin' around till a man cain't trust 
his own chair to set still under 
him. It gets you, son. A man kin 
only stand so much!" 

To Mart's dismay, Jenkins's 
eyes began to fill with large tears. 
"Got no friend no more to offer 
me a drink now and again, 
sociable-like, or help me with the 
chores, times I got the misery in 
my back. I ain't a well man, son. 
Times it's more'n I kin do to get 
outa bed in the mornin'. 

"Look, son," Jenkins said, 
turning to Matt pleadingly. "Yore 
a city feller. Yore right nicelookin' with manners and edyacation. I reckon Ab likes you. 
Whyn't you take her with you?" 
Matt started retreating toward 
the door. "She's right purty when 
she fixes up and she kin cook 
right smart. You'd think a skillet 
was part of her hand, the way she 
kin handle one, and you don't 
even have to marry up with her." 

]%/|"ATT backed away, whitefaced and incredulous. "You 
must be mad. You can't give a 
girl away like that." He turned 
to make a dash for the door. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



13 



A heavy hand fell on Matt's 
shoulder and spun him around. 
"Son," Jenkins said, his voice 
heavy with menace, "any man 
that's alone with a gal more'n 
twenty minutes, it's thought 
proper they should get married 
up quick. Since yore a stranger, 
I ain't holdin' you to it. But when 
Ab left me, she stopped bein' my 
daughter. Nobody asked you to 
bring her back. That gal," he said 
woefully, "eats more'n I do." 

Matt reached into his hip 
pocket. He pulled out his billfold 
and extracted a five dollar bill. 

"Here," he said, extending it 
toward Jenkins, "maybe this will 
make life a little more pleasant." 

Jenkins looked at the money 
wistfully, started to reach for it, 
and jerked his hand away. 

"I cain't do it," he moaned. "It 
ain't worth it. You brought her 
back. You kin take her away." 

Matt glanced out the doorway 
toward the car and shuddered. He 
added another five to the one in 
his hand. 

Jenkins sweated. His hand 
crept out. Finally, desperately, he 
crumpled the bills into his palm. 
"All right," he said hoarsely. 

"Them's ten mighty powerful reasons." 

Matt ran to the car as if he had 
escaped from bedlam. He opened 
the door and slipped in. "Get 
out," he said sharply. "You're 
home." 



"But Paw—" 

"From now on, he'll be a doting father." Matt reached across 
and opened the door for her. 
"Good-by." 

Slowly Abigail got out. She 
rounded the car and walked up 
to the porch, dragging her feet. 
But when she reached the porch, 
she straightened up. Jenkins, who 
was standing in the doorway, 
shrank back from his five-foottall daughter as she approached. 

"Dirty, nasty old man," Abigail 
hissed. 

Jenkins flinched. After she had 
passed, he raised the bottle hastily to his beard. His hand must 
have slipped. By some unaccountable mischance, the bottle 
kept rising in the air, mouth 
downward. The bourbon gushed 
over his head. 

Pathetically, looking more like 
Neptune than ever, Jenkins 
peered toward the car and shook 
his head. 

Feverishly, Matt turned the car 
around and jumped the car out of 
the yard. It had undoubtedly 
been an optical illusion. A bottle 
does not hang in the air without 
support. 

/"^UY'S cabin should not have 
been so difficult to find. Although the night was dark, the 
directions were explicit. But for 
two hours Matt bounced back 
and forth along the dirt roads of 



14 




 



the hills. He got tired and hungry. 

For the fourth time, he passed 
the cabin which fitted the directions in every way but one — it 
was occupied. Lights streamed 
from the windows into the night. 
Matt turned into the steep driveway. He could, at least, ask directions. 

As he walked toward the door, 
the odor of frying ham drifted 
from the house to tantalize him. 
Matt knocked, his mouth watering. Perhaps he could even get 
an invitation to supper. 

The door swung open. "Come 
on in. What kept you?" 

Matt blinked. "Oh, no!" he 
cried. For a frantic moment, it 
was like the old vaudeville routine of the drunk in the hotel who 
keeps staggering back to knock 
on the same door. Each time he 
is more indignantly ejected until 
finally he complains, "My God, 
are you in all the rooms?" 

"What are you doing here?" 
Matt asked faintly. "How did 
you — How could you — ?" 

Abigail pulled him into the 
cabin. It looked bright and cheerful and clean. The floor was newly swept; a broom leaned in the 
corner. The two lower bunks on 
opposite walls were neatly made 
up. Two places were laid at the 
table. Food was cooking on the 
wood stove. 

"Paw changed his mind," she 
said. 



"But he couldn't! I gave 
him—" 

"Oh, that." She reached into a 
pocket of her dress. "Here." 

She handed him the two crumpled five dollar bills and a handful of silver and copper that Matt 
dazedly added up to one dollar 
and thirty-seven cents. 

"Paw said he'd have sent more, 
but it was all he had. So he 
threw in some vittles." 

He sat down in a chair heavily. 
"But you couldn't — I didn't know 
where the place was myself, exactly. I didn't tell you—" 

"I always been good at finding 
things," she said. "Places, things 
that are lost. Like a cat, I guess." 

"But — but — " Matt spluttered, 
"how did you get here?" 

"I rode," she said. Instinctively, 
Mart's eyes switched to the broom 
in the corner. "Paw loaned me 
the mule. I let her go. She'll get 
home all right." 

"But you can't stay here. It's 
impossible!" 

"Now, Mr. Wright," Abigail 
said soothingly. "My Maw used 
to say a man should never make 
a decision on a empty stomach. 
You just sit there and relax. Supper's all ready. You must be nigh 
starved." 

"There's no decision to be 
made!" Matt said, but he watched 
while she put things on the table 
— thick slices of fried ham with 
cream gravy, corn on the cob, 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



15 



fluffy biscuits, butter, homemade 
jelly, strong black coffee that was 
steaming and fragrant. Abigail's 
cheeks were flushed from the 
stove, and her face was peaceful. 
She looked almost pretty. 

"I can't eat a bite," Matt told 
her. 

"Nonsense." Abigail filled his 
plate. 

|^LUMLY, Matt sliced off a 
^-^ bite of ham and put it in his 
mouth. It was so tender, it almost 
melted. Before long he was eating 
as fast as he could shovel the 
food into his mouth. The food 
was delicious; everything was 
cooked just as he liked it. He had 
never been able to tell anyone 
how to fix it that way. But that 
was the way it was. 

He pushed himself back from 
the table, teetering against the 
wall on the back legs of his chair, 
lit a cigarette and watched Abigail pour him a third cup of 
coffee. He was swept by a wave 
of contentment. 

"If I'd had time I'd a made a 
peach pie. I make real good peach 
pie," Abigail said. 

Matt nodded lazily. There 
would be compensations in having someone around to — 

"No!" he said violently, thumping down on the two front legs 
of his chair. "It won't work. You 
can't stay here. What would people say?" 



"Who'd care? — Paw don't. 
Anyways, I could say we was 
married." 

"No!" Matt said hoarsely. 
"Please don't do that!" 

"Please, Mr. Wright," she 
pleaded, "let me cook and clean 
for you. I wouldn't be no trouble, 
Mr. Wright, honest I wouldn't." 

"Look, Abbie!" He took her 
hand. It was soft and feminine. 
She stood beside his chair obediently, her eyes cast down. 
"You're a nice girl, and I like 
you. You can cook better than 
anyone I've ever known, and 
you'll make some man a good 
wife. But I think too much of 
you to let you ruin your name by 
staying here along with me. 
You'll have to go back to your 
father." 

The life seemed to flow out of 
her. "All right," she said, so low 
that it was difficult to hear her. 

Dazed at his sudden success, 
Matt got up and walked toward 
the door. She followed him, and 
Matt could almost feel the tears 
welling in her eyes. 

Matt opened the car door for 
her and helped her in. He circled 
the front of the car and slid into 
the driver's seat. Abbie huddled 
against the far door, small and 
forlorn. 

Since Matt's speech, she hadn't 
said a word. Suddenly, Matt felt 
very sorry for her and ashamed, 
as if he had hit a child. The poor 



16 




 



little thing! he thought. Then he 
caught himself. He shook his 
head. For a poor little thing, she 
had certainly managed to browbeat her father. 

He thumbed the starter button, 
and the motor growled, but it 
didn't catch. Matt let it whine 
to a stop and pressed again. The 
motor moaned futilely. Matt 
checked the ignition. It was on. 
Again and again he pushed in 
the button. The moans got weaker. He tried to roll the car — 
but the brakes locked. 

T¥E glanced suspiciously at Abigail. Bur that's absurd, he 
thought. Since he had met Abbie, 
his thoughts had taken a definite 
paranoid tinge. It was foolish to 
blame everything that went wrong 
on the girl. 

But the car wouldn't move. He 
gave up. 

"All right," he sighed. "I can't 
put you out this far from home. 
You can sleep here tonight." 

Silently, she followed him into 
the cabin. She helped him tack 
blankets to the upper bunks on 
each side of the cabin. They made 
an effective curtain around the 
lower beds. As they worked, Matt 
discovered that he was unusually 
sensitive to her nearness. There 
was a sweet, womanly smell to 
her, and when she brushed agairrst 
him the spot that was touched 
came to life — tingling awareness. 



When they finished, Abbie 
reached down and grasped the 
hem of her dress to pull it off 
over her head. 

"No, no," Matt said hurriedly. 
"Don't you have any modesty? 
Why do you think we tacked up 
those blankets?" He gestured to 
the bunk on the left hand wall. 
"Dress and undress in there." 

She let the hem of her dress 
fall, nodded meekly, and climbed 
into the bunk. 

Matt stared after her for a moment and released his breath. He 
turned and climbed into his own 
bunk, undressed, and slipped 
under the blanket. Then he remembered that he had forgotten 
to turn out the lamps. 

He rose on one elbow and heard 
a soft padding on the floor. The 
lamps went out, one by one, and 
the padding faded to the other 
side of the room. Rustling sounds. 
Darkness and silence. 

"Good night, Mr. Wright." It 
was a little child's voice in the 
night. 

"Good night, Abbie," he said 
softly. And then after a moment, 
firmly, "But don't *forget — back 
you go first thing in the morning." 

Before the silence wove a pattern of sleep, Matt heard a little 
sound from the other bunk. He 
couldn't quite identify it. 

A sob? A snore? Or a muffled 
titter? 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



17 



^T^HE odor of frying bacon and 
boiling coffee crept into Matt's 
nightmare of a terrifying pursuit 
by an implacable and invisible 
enemy. Matt opened his eyes. The 
bunk was bright with diffused 
sunlight; the dream faded. Matt 
sniffed hungrily and pushed aside 
the blanket to look out. 

All the supplies from the car 
had been unloaded and neatly 
stowed away. On a little corner 
table by the window were his 
typewriter and precious manila 
folders, and a stack of blank 
white paper. 

Matt dressed hurriedly in his 
cramped quarters. When he 
emerged from his cocoon, Abbie 
was humming happily as she set 
breakfast on the table. She wore 
a different dress this morning — a 
brown calico that did horrible 
things for her hair and coloring, 
but fitted better than the blue 
gingham. The dress revealed a 
slim but unsuspectedly mature 
figure. 

How would she look, he wondered briefly, in good clothes and 
nylons, shoes, and make-up? 

The thought crumbled before 
a fresh onslaught to his senses 
of the odor and sight of breakfast. 
The eggs were cooked just right, 
sunny side up, the white firm but 
not hard. It was strange how 
Abbie anticipated his preferences. 
At first he thought that she had 
overestimated his appetite, but 



he stowed away three eggs while 
Abbie ate two, heartily. 

He pushed back his plate with 
a sigh. "Well," he began. She got 
very quiet and stared at the floor. 
His heart melted. He felt too contented ; a few hours more wouldn't 
make any difference. Tonight 
would be time enough for her to 
go back. "Well," he repeated, "I 
guess I'd better get to work." 

Abbie sprang to clear the table. 
Matt walked to the corner where 
the typewriter was waiting. He 
sat down in the chair and rolled 
in a sheet of paper. The table was 
well arranged for light; it was 
the right height. Everything considered, it was just about perfect 
for working. 

He stared at the blank sheet 
of paper. He leafed through his 
notes. He resisted an impulse to 
get up and walk around. He 
rested his fingers lightly on the 
keys and after a moment lifted 
them, crossed one leg over the 
other knee, put his right elbow 
on the raised leg, and began to 
finger his chin. 

There was only one thing 
wrong: he didn't feel like working. 

Finally he typed in the middle 
of the page: 

THE PSYCHODYNAMICS OF 
WITCHCRAFT 

With Special Reference to the 

Salem Trials of 1692 
He double-spaced and stopped. 



18 




 



TT wasn't that Abbie was noisy; 

she was too quiet, with a kind 
of purposeful restraint that is 
worse than chaos. With one ear 
Matt listened to the sounds of 
dishwashing and stacking. And 
then silence. 

Matt stood it as long as he 
could and turned. Abbie was 
seated at the table. She was sewing up a hole in the pocket of 
his other pair of pants. He could 
almost see the aura of bliss that 
surrounded her. 

Like a child, Matt thought, 
playing at domesticity. But there 
was something mature about it, 
too; a mature and basic fulfillment. // we could all be happy 
with so little. Ifs a pity, with so 
small an ambition, to have the 
real thing so elusive. 

As if she felt him looking at 
her, Abbie glanced around and 
beamed. Matt turned back to his 
typewriter. It still wouldn't come. 

Witchcraft, he began hesitantly, is the attempt of the primitive 
mind to bring order out of chaos. 
It is significant, therefore, that 
belief in witchcraft fades as an 
understanding of the natural 
workings of the physical universe grows more prevalent. 

He let his hands drop. It was 
all wrong, like an image seen in 
a distorted mirror. He swung 
around: "Who wrecked your 
father's house?" 

"Libby," she said. 

WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



"Libby?" Matt echoed, "Who's 
Libby?" 

"The other me," Abbie said 
calmly. "Mostly I keep her bottled up inside, but when I feel' 
sad and unhappy I can't keep her 
in. Then she gets loose and just 
goes wild. I can't control her.'" 

Good God! Matt thought, 
Schizophrenia! "Where did you 
get an idea like that?" he asked 
cautiously. 

"When I was born," Abbie said, 
"I had a twin sister, only she 
died real quick. Maw said I was 
stronger and just crowded the 
life right out of her. When I was 
bad, Maw used to shake her 
head and say Libby'd never have 
been mean or cross or naughty. So 
when something happened, . I 
started saying Libby done it. It 
didn't stop a licking, but it made 
me feel better." 

What a thing to tell a child! 
Matt thought. 

"Purty soon I got to believing 
it, that Libby done the bad things 
that I got licked for, that Libby 
was part of me that I had to push 
deep down so she couldn't get 
out and get me in trouble. After 
I" — she blushed — "got older and 
funny things started happening, 
Libby come in real handy." 

"Can you see her?" Matt ventured. 

"Course not," Abbie said reproachfully. "She ain't real." 
"Isn't." 

« 

19 



"Isn't real, Abbie said. "Things 
happen when I feel bad. I can't 
do anything about it. But you got 
to explain it somehow ... I use 
Libby." 

Matt sighed. Abbie wasn't so 
crazy — or stupid either. "You 
can't contrdl it — ever?" 

"Well, maybe a little. Like 
when I felt kind of mean about 
that liquor you gave Paw, and I 
thought how nice it would be if 
Paw had something wet on the 
outside for a change." 

"How about a tire and a hub 
cap full of nuts?" 

She laughed. Again that tinkling of little silver bells. "You 
did look funny." 

Matt frowned. But slowly his 
expression cleared and he began 
to chuckle. "I guess I did." 

TTE swung back to the typewriter before he realized that 
he was accepting the events of 
the last eighteen hours as physical 
facts and Abbie's explanation as 
theoretically possible. Did he 
actually believe that Abbie could 
— how was he going to express 
it? — move objects with some mysterious, intangible force? By wishing? Of course he didn't, He 
stared at the typewriter. Or did 
he? 

He called up a picture of a pint 
bottle hanging unsupported in 
mid air, emptying its contents 
over Jenkins's head. He remem


20 G 



bered a dish that jumped from a 
shelf to shatter on the floor. He 
thought of a hub cap that dumped 
its contents into the dirt when 
his foot was two inches away. 
And he saw a tire straighten up 
and begin to roll down a level 
road. 

You can't just dismiss things, 
he thought. In any comprehensive scheme of the universe, you 
must include all valid phenomena. If the accepted scheme of 
things cannot find a place for it, 
then the scheme must change. 

Matt shivered. It was a disturbing thought. 

The primitive mind believed 
that inanimate objects had spirits 
that must be propitiated. With a 
little sophistication came mythology and its personification — 
nymphs and sprites, Poseidon and 
Aeolus — and folklore, with its 
kobolds and poltergeists. 

Sir James Frazer said something about the relationship between science and magic. Man, he 
said, associates ideas by similarity and by contiguity in space or 
time. If the association is legitimate, it is science; if illegitimate, 
it is magic, science's bastard sister. 

But if the associations of magic 
are legitimate, then those of science must be illegitimate, and the 
two reverse their roles and the 
modern world is standing on its 
head. 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Matt felt a little dizzy. 

Suppose the primitive mind is 
wiser than we are. Suppose you 
can insure good luck by the proper ritual or kill your enemy by 
sticking a pin in a wax doll. Suppose you can prove it. 

You had to have some kind of 
explanation of unnatural events, 
the square pegs that do not fit 
into any of science's round holes. 
Even Abbie recognized that. 

Matt knew what the scientific 
explanation would be: illusion, 
delusion, hypnosis, anything 
which demanded the least possible rearrangement of accepted 
theory, anything which, in effect, 
denied the existence of the phenomenon. 

"OUT how could you really explain it? How could you explain Abbie? Did you^ believe in 
the spirits of inanimate objects, 
directed by Abbie when she was 
in the proper mood? Did you be' 
lieve in poltergeists which Abbie 
ordered about? Did you believe 
in Libby, the intangible projectable, manipulative external soul? 

You had to explain Abbie or 
your cosmology was worthless. 

That man at Duke — Rhine, 
the parapsychologist — he had a 
word for it. Telekinesis. That was 
one attempt to incorporate psychic phenomena into the body 
of science, or, perhaps, to alter 
the theoretical universe in order 



to fit those phenomena into it. 

But it didn't explain anything. 

Then Matt thought of electricity. You don't have to explain 
something in order to use it. You 
don't have to understand it in 
order to control it. It helps, but 
it isn't essential. Understanding 
is a psychological necessity, not 
a physical one. 

Matt stared at the words he 
had written. The seventeenth 
century. Why was he wasting his 
time? Here was something immediate. He had stumbled on 
something that would set the 
whole world on its ear, or perhaps 
stand it on its feet again. It would 
not molder away, as the thesis 
would in a university library. 

Matt turned around. Abbie was 
sitting at the table, her mending 
finished, staring placidly out the 
open doorway. Matt stood up and 
walked toward her. She turned 
her head to look at him, smiling 
slowly. Matt turned his head, 
searching the room. 

"Kin I get you something?" 
Abbie asked anxiously. 

Matt looked down at her. 
"Here!" he said. He plucked the 
needle from the spool of darning 
thread. He forced it lightly into 
the rough top of the table so that 
the needle stood upright. "Now," 
he said defiantly, "make it move." 

Abbie stared at him. "Why?" 

"I want to see you do it," Matt 
said firmly. "Isn't that enough?" 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



21 



"But I don't want to," Abbie 
objected. "I never wanted to do 
it. It just happened." 

"Try!" 

"No, Mr. Wright," Abbie said 
firmly. "It never brung me nothing but misery. It scared away 
all my fellers and all Paw's 
friends. Folks don't like people 
who can do things like that. I 
don't ever want it to happen 
again." 

"If you want to stay here," 
Matt said flatly, "you'll do as I 
say." 

"Please, Mr. Wright," she begged. "Don't make me do it. It'll 
spoil everything. It's bad enough 
when you can't help it, but it's 
worse when you do it a -purpose 
— something terrible will come 
of it." 

Matt glowered at her. Her 
pleading eyes dropped. She bit 
her lip. She stared at the needle. 
Her smooth, young forehead 
tightened. 

Nothing happened. The needle 
remained upright. 

Abbie took a deep breath. "I 
cain't, Mr. Wright," she wailed. 
"I just cain't do it." 

"Why not?" Matt demanded 
fiercely. "Why can't you do it?" 

"I don't know," Abbie said. 
Automatically her hands began 
to smooth the pants laid across 
her lap. She looked down and 
blushed. "I guess it's 'cause I'm 
happy." 



A FTER a morning of experimentation, Mart's only halfconscious need was still 
unsatisfied. He had offered Abbie 
an innumerable assortment of objects: a spool of thread, a fountain pen cap, a dime, a typewriter 
eraser, a three-by-five note card, 
a piece of folded paper, a bottle 
. . . The last Matt considered a 
stroke of genius. But tip it as he 
would, the bottle, like all the rest 
of the objects, remained stolidly 
unaffected. 

He even got the spare tire out 
of the trunk and leaned it against 
the side of the car. Fifteen minutes later, it was still leaning 
there. 

Finally, frowning darkly, Matt 
took a cup from the shelf and 
put it down on the table. "Here," 
he said. "You're so good at 
smashing dishes, smash this." 

Abbie stared at the cup hopelessly. Her face seemed old and 
haggard. After a moment, her 
body seemed to collapse all at 
once. "I cain't," she moaned. "I 
cain't." 

"Can't!" Matt shouted. "Can't! 
Are you so stupid you can't say 
that? Not 'cain'f — can't!" 

Her large blue eyes lifted to 
Mart's in mute appeal. They began to fill with tears. "I can't," ' 
she said. A sob broke from her 
throat. She put her head down 
on her arms. Her thin shoulders 
began to quiver. 



22 




 




Moodily, Matt stared at her 
back. Was everything that he had 
seen merely an illusion? Or did 
this phenomenon only evidence 
itself under very rigid conditions? 
Did she have to be unhappy? 

It was not without a certain 
logic. Neurotic children had played a large part in the history of 
witchcraft. In one of the English 
trials, children had reportedly 
fallen into fits and vomited crooked pins. They could not pronounce such holy names as 
"Lord," "Jesus," or "Christ," but 
they could readily speak the 
names "Satan" or "Devil." Between the middle of the fifteenth 
century and the middle of the 
sixteenth, 100,000 persons had 
been put to death for witchcraft. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



23 



How many had come to the rack, 
the stake, or the drowning pool, 
through the accusations of children? A child saw a hag at her 
door. The next moment she saw 
a hare run by and the woman 
had disappeared. On no more 
convincing evidence than that, 
the woman was accused of turning herself into a hare by witchcraft. 

Why had the children done it? 
Suggestibility? A desire for attention? 

Whatever the reason, it was 
tainted with abnormality. 

In the field of psychic phenomena as well, the investigations of 
the Society of Psychical Research 
were full of instances in which 
neurotic children or neurotic 
young women played a distinct 
if inexplicable role. 

Did Abbie have to be unhappy? 
Matt's lips twisted. // it was true, 
it was hard on Abbie. 

"Get your things together," 
Matt said harshly. "You're going 
home to your father." 

Abbie stiffened and looked up, 
her face tear-streaked but her 
eyes blazing. "I ain't." 

"You are not," Matt corrected 
sharply. 

"I are not," Abbie said fiercely. 
"I are not. I are not." 

Suddenly the cup was sailing 
toward Matt's head. Instinctively, 
he put out his hand. The cup hit 
it and stuck. Matt looked at it 



dazedly and back at Abbie. Her 
hands were still in her lap. 

YOU did it!" Matt shouted. 
"It's true." 
Abbie looked pleased. "Do I 
have to go back to Paw?" 

Matt thought a moment. "No," 
he said. "Not if you'll help me." 

Abbie's lips tightened. "Ain't — 
isn't once enough, Mr. Wright? 
You know I can do it. Won't you 
leave it alone now? It's unlucky. 
Something awful will happen. I 
got a feeling." She looked up at 
his implacable face. "But I'll do 
it, if you want." 

"It's important," Matt said 
gently. "Now. What did you feel 
just before the cup moved toward 
me?" 
"Mad." 

"No, no. I mean what did you 
feel physically or mentally not 
emotionally." 

Abbie's eyebrows were thick. 
When she knit them, they made 
a straight line across the top of 
her nose. "Gosh, Mr. Wright, I 
cain't — " She looked at him 
quickly. "I can't find the words 
to tell about it. It's like I wanted 
to pick up the nearest thing and 
throw it at you, and then it was 
like I had thrown it. Kind of a 
push from all of me, instead of 
just my hand." 

Matt frowned while he put the 
cup back on the table. "Try to 
feel exactly like that again."

Obediently, Abbie concentrated. Her face worked. Finally she 
sagged back in her chair. "I cai — 
I can't. I just don't feel like it." 

"You're going back to your 
father!" Matt snapped. 

The cup rocked. 

"There!" Matt said quickly. 
"Try it again before you forget!" 

The cup spun around. 

"Again!" 

The cup rose an inch from the 
table and settled down. 

Abbie sighed. "It was just a 
trick, wasn't it, Mr. Wright? You 
aren't really going to send me 
back?" 

"No, but maybe you'll wish I 
had before we're through. You'll 
have to work and practice until 
you have full conscious control 
of whatever it is." 

"All right," Abbie said submissively. "But it's terrible tiring 
work when you don't feel like it." 

"Terribly," Matt corrected. 

"Terribly," Abbie repeated. 

"Now," Matt said. "Try it 
again." 

k BBIE practiced until noon. 

Her maximum effort was to 
raise the cup a foot from the 
table, but that she could do very 
well. 

"Where does the energy come 
from?" Matt asked. 

"I don't know," Abbie sighed, 
"but I'm powerful hungry." 

"Very," Matt said. 



"Very hungry," Abbie repeated. 
She got up and walked to the 
cupboard. "How many ham sandwiches do you want — two?" 

Matt nodded absently. When 
the sandwiches came, he ate in 
thoughtful silence. 

It was true, then. Abbie could 
do it, but she had to be unhappy 
to have full power and control. 

"Try it on the mustard," he 
said. 

"I'm so full," Abbie explained 
contentedly. She had eaten three 
sandwiches. 

Matt stared at the yellow jar, 
unseeing. It was quite a problem. 
There was no sure way of determining just what Abbie's powers 
were, without getting some equipment. He had to find out just 
what it was she did, and what 
effect it had on her, before he 
could expect to fully evaluate any 
data. 

But that wasn't the hardest 
part of it. He should be able to 
pick up the things he needed in 
Springfield. It was what he was 
going to have to do to Abbie that 
troubled him. 

All he had been able to find out 
about Abbie's phenomena was 
that they seemed to occur with 
the greatest frequency and 
strength when the girl was unhappy. 

Matt stared out through the 
cabin window. 

Gradually, he was forming a • 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



25 



plan to make Abbie unhappier 
than she had ever been. 

A LL afternoon Matt was very 
kind to Abbie. He helped her 
dry the dishes, although she protested vigorously. He talked to 
her about his life and about his 
studies at the University of Kansas. He told her about the thesis 
and how he had to write it to get 
his master's degree in psychology 
and what he wanted to do when 
he was graduated. 

"Psychology," he said, "is only 
an infant science. It isn't really a 
science at all but a metaphysics. 
It's a lot of theorizing from in-* 
sufficient data. The only way you 
can get data is by experimentation, and you can't experiment 
because psychology is people, living people. Science is a ruthless 
business of observation and setting up theories and then knocking them down in laboratories. 
Physicists can destroy everything 
from atoms to whole islands; biologists can destroy animals; anatomists can dissect cadavers. But 
psychologists have no true laboratories; they can't be ruthless because public opinion won't stand 
for it, and cadavers aren't much 
good. Psychology will never be 
a true science until it has its laboratories where it can be just as 
ruthless as the physical sciences. 
It has to come." 

Matt stopped. Abbie was a 



good listener; he had forgotten 
he was talking to a hill girl. 

"Tell me more about K.U.," 
she sighed. 

He tried to answer her questions about what the coeds wore 
when they went to classes and 
when they had dates and when 
they went to dances. Her eyes 
grew large and round. 

"Guess it would be romantic," 
Abbie sighed. "How far do they 
let a fellow go if they ain't — 
aren't serious?" 

Matt thought Abbie's attempt 
to improve her English was 
touching — almost pathetic. He 
puzzled about her question for a 
moment. "I guess it depends on 
the girl." 

Abbie nodded understandingly. 
"Why do they go to college?" 

"To get married," Matt said. 
"Most of them." 

Abbie shook her head. "All 
those pretty clothes. All those 
men. They must be awful — very 
slow not to get married quick. 
Can't they get married at home 
without waiting so long?" 

Matt frowned perplexedly! Abbie had a talent for asking questions which reached down to basic 
social relationships. "The men 
they meet at college will make 
more money for them." 

"Oh," Abbie said. She shrugged. "That's all right, I guess, if 
that's what you want." 

So it went. Matt paid Abbie 



26 




 



little compliments on her appearance, and she blushed and looked 
pleased. He told her he couldn't 
understand why she wasn't besieged by suitors and why she 
hadn't been married long ago. 
She blushed deeper. He bragged 
expansively on the supper she 
cooked and swore that he had 
never tasted better. 

A BBIE couldn't have been happier. She hummed through 
her tasks. Everything worked well 
for her. The dishes were done 
almost as soon as they were 
started. 

Matt walked out on the porch. 
He sat down on the edge. Abbie 
settled herself beside him, quietly, 
not touching him, her hands in 
her lap. 

The cabin was built on the top 
of a ridge. It was night, but the 
moon had come up big and yellow, and they could look far out 
over the valley. Silvery, in a dark 
green setting of trees, the lake 
glimmered far below. 

"Ain't — isn't it purty," Abbie 
sighed, folding her hands. 

"Pretty," Matt said absently. 

"Pretty," Abbie sighed. 

They sat in silence. Matt sensed her nearness in a way that was 
almost physical. It stirred him. 
There was something intensely 
feminine about Abbie that was 
very appealing at times, in spite 
of her plain face and shapeless 



clothes and bare feet and lack 
of education. Even her singleminded ambition was a striving 
to fulfill her true, her basic function. In a way it was more vital 
and understandable than all the 
confused sublimations of the girls 
he had known. 

Abbie, at least, knew what she 
wanted and what she would pay 
to get it. She would make someone a good wife. Her one goal 
would be to make her husband 
happy. She would cook and clean 
for him and bear his strong, 
healthy children with a great and 
thrilling joy. She would be silent 
when he was silent, unobtrusive 
when he was working, merry 
when he was gay, infinitely responsive when he was passionate. 
And the transcendent wonder of 
it was that she would be fulfilling 
her finest function in doing it; she 
would be serenely happy, blissfully content. 

Matt lit a cigarette in an attempt to break the mood. He 
glanced at her face by the light of 
the match. "What is courting like 
here in the hills?" he asked. 

"Sometimes we walk," Abbie 
said dreamily, "and look at things 
together, and talk a little. Sometimes there's a dance at the school 
house. If a fellow has a boat, you 
can go out on the lake. There's 
huskin' bees an' church socials 
an' picnics. But mostly when the 
moon is a-shinin' an' the night is 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



27 



warm, we just sit on a porch an' 
hold hands and do whatever the 
girl's willin' to allow." 

Matt reached out and took one 
of her hands and held it in his. 
It was cool and dry and strong. 
It clung to his hand. 

She turned her face to him, her 
eyes searching for his face in the 
darkness. "Do you like me a little 
bit, Mr. Wright?" she asked softly. "Not marryin'-like, but friendly-like?" 

"I think that you're the most 
feminine girl I've ever met," he 
said, and realized it was true. 

Almost without volition on 
either part, they seemed to lean 
together, blending in the night. 
Matt's lips sought her pale little 
girl lips and found them, and they 
weren't pale or little girlish at all, 
but warm and soft and passionate. Matt felt her lips part. He 
broke away, breathing quickly. 

Abbie half turned to nestle 
against his shoulder, his arm held 
tightly around her. She sighed 
contentedly. "I reckon I wouldn't 
be unwillin'," she said tremulously, "whatever you wanted to 
do." 

"I can't understand whv you 
didn't get married long ago," he 
said. 

"T guess it was me," Abbie said 
•■• reflectively. "I wasn't rightly satisfied with any of my fellows. I'd get mad at them for no 



reason at all, and then something 
bad would happen to them and 
pretty soon no one would come 
courtin'. Maybe I expected them 
to be what they weren't. I guess 
I wasn't really in love with any of 
them. Anyways, I'm glad I didn't 
get married up." She sighed. 

Matt felt the stirrings of something that felt oddly like compunction. What a louse you are, 
Matthew Wright! 

"What happened to them — 
your fellows?" he asked. "Was it 
something you did?" 

"Folks said it was," Abbie said. 
There was a trace of bitterness 
in her voice. "They said I had the 
evil eye. I don't see how. There 
isn't anything wrong with my 
eyes, is there?" She looked up at 
him ; her eyes were large and dark 
blue, with little flecks of silvery 
moonlight in them. 

"Not a thing," Matt said. 
"They're very beautiful." 

"I don't see how it could have 
been any of my fault," Abbie said. 
"Of course, when Hank was late 
that evening, I told him he was 
so slow he might as well have a 
broken leg. Right after that he 
was . nailing shingles on a roof, 
and he fell off and broke his leg. 
But I reckon he'd have broke it 
anyways. He was always right 
careless. 

"And then Gene, he was so cold 
I told him he should fall in the 
lake and warm up. But a person 



28 




 



who does a lot of fishin', I guess 
he falls in a lot anyways." 

"I guess so," Matt said. He 
began to shiver. ■ 

"You're shivering, Mr. Wright," 
Abbie said solicitously. "Let me 
go get your jacket." 

"Never mind," Matt said. "It's 
about time for bed anyway. You 
go in and get ready. Tomorrow — 
tomorrow we're going to drive 
( to Springfield for some shopping." 

"Really, Mr. Wright? I haven't 
never been to Springfield," Abbie 
said incredulously. She got up, 
her eyes shining. "Really?" 

"Really," Matt said. "Go on in, 
now." 

She went in. She was almost 
dancing. 

Matt sat on the porch for a 
few minutes longer, thinking. It 
was funny what happened to the 
fellows that disappointed Abbie. 
When he lit a cigarette, his hand 
was shaking. 

Abbie had a way of being many 
different persons. Already Matt 
had known four of them: the 
moody little girl with braids down 
her back shuffling along a dusty 
road or bouncing gleefully on a 
car seat; the happy, placid housewife with cheeks rosy from the 
stove; the unhappy vessel of 
strange powers, tearful and reluctant; the girl with the passionate lips in the moon-streaked 
darkness. Which one was Abbie, 
the true Abbie? 



fT^HE next morning Matt had a 
fifth Abbie to consider. Her 
face was scrubbed and shining 
until it almost rivaled her eyes. 
Her braided hair was wound in a 
coronet around her head. She was 
wearing a different dress made of 
a shiny blue quilted material with 
a red lining. Matt scanned his 
small knowledge of dress materials. Taffeta? The color did terrible things to her hair. The dress 
had a V-shape neck and back and 
fitted better than anything she 
had worn yet. On one hip was a 
large artificial rose. Her stockingless feet were enclosed in a 
pair of black, patent-leather 
sandals. 

My God! Matt thought. Her 
Sunday best! I'll have to walk 
with that down the streets of 
Springfield. He shuddered, and 
resisted the impulse to tear off 
that horrible rose. 

"Well," he said, "all ready?" 

Abbie blushed excitedly. "Are 
we really going to Springfield, Mr. 
- Wright?" 

"We are if the car will start." 

"Oh, it'll start," Abbie said 
confidently. 

Matt gave her a thoughtful 
sidelong glance. That was another 
thing. 

After the usual hearty breakfast, with fried potatoes on the 
side, they got into the car. The 
brakes released without hesitation. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



29 



The drive was more than fifty 
miles, half of it over dirt roads 
that were roller-coaster washboards, and they drove it in silence. Every few miles Matt 
would glance at Abbie out of the 
corner of his eye and shudder. 
As excited as she was, like a child, 
Abbie was contented to sit quietly 
and enjoy the ride, particularly 
when they swung off the dirt road 
onto Highway 665. 

When they came into Springfield, Abbie's face was glowing. 
She stared at the buildings as if 
they had sprung magically into 
being especially for her. Then 
she began to inspect the people 
walking along the streets. Matt 
noticed that it was the women 
who received her closest attention. 

Suddenly Matt noticed that 
Abbie was very quiet. He glanced 
toward her. She was still, staring 
down at her hands resting in her 
lap. 

"What's the matter?" Matt 
asked. 

"I guess," she said, her voice a 
little unsteady, "I guess I look 
pretty funny. I guess you'll feel 
ashamed having me along. If it's 
all right with you, Mr. Wright, 
I'll just sit in the car." 

"Nonsense," Matt said heartily. 
"You look fine." The little devil, 
he thought. She has an uncanny 
talent for understanding things. 
She's either unusually perceptive 



or — What? "Besides, I'll need 
you to try on some clothes." 

"Clothes, Mr. Wright!" she exclaimed. She seemed to find it 
hard to speak. "You're going to 
buy some clothes." 

Matt nodded. He parked the 
car in front of Springfield's biggest department store. He came 
around to Abbie's door and helped her out. For a moment Abbie's 
face was level with his; her blue % 
eyes locked with his dark ones in 
a look that Matt refused to analyze. They walked into the store, 
Abbie clinging to his arm. He 
could feel her heart beating swiftly. Matt stopped a moment to 
study the directory. 

"Second floor," he said. 

Abbie held back as Matt started off. "Kin we — can we look 
around here — for just a second?" 
Abbie asked hesitantly. 

Matt glanced at her and shrugged. "I suppose so." 

A BBIE started off determinedly 
toward some mysterious, unseen destination, leading Matt 
down innumerable aisles. All the 
way to the back of the store they 
went, and emerged miraculously 
into the kitchen ware department. 
Abbie stopped on the threshhold, 
gazing rapturously at the gleaming pots and pans, beaters, knives, 
and gadgets, as if they were 
jewels. She dismissed with a 
glance the stoves and electrical 



30 




 



appliances, but the cooking utensils brought forth long sighs. 
After a moment she moved 
among them, staring at them, 
touching them with one timid finger. She made little crooning 
sounds deep in her throat. 

Matt had to drag her away. 

They were almost to the stairs 
when Matt noticed that she was 
1 olding something to her breast. 
He stopped. He stared aghast. 
She was hugging a tiny frying 
pan of shiny aluminum and dully 
gleaming copper. 

"Where did you get that?" he 
demanded. 

"Back there," she said innocently. "They got so many. 
They'll never miss a little thing 
like this." 

"But you can't do that!" Matt 
said. "That's stealing." 

" 'Tain't stealing when they got 
so much and I got so little," she 
explained. 

"You've got to take it- back!" 
Matt made a futile grab for the 
frying pan. Abbie hugged it to 
her breast with both arms. 

"Don't take it away from me!" 
she wailed. "Please don't make 
me take it back!" 

Matt glanced around nervously. So far no one seemed to be 
watching them. He turned back 
to Abbie. "Sh-h-h!" he said. "Be 
quiet now. Please be quiet." He 
looked at her pleadingly. She 
hugged the frying pan tighter. 



"All right," he sighed. "Stay here! 
Don't move! Don't say anything!" 

QUICKLY he walked back to 
kitchenwares. He caught the 
attention of the clerk. "How 
much are those," he said, pointing 
to the frying pans. 

"Four-fifty, sir. Shall I wrap 
one up?" 
"Four-fifty!" 

"Yes, sir," the man said. "We 
have some cheaper ones in all 
aluminum — " 

"Never mind," Matt said hurriedly. He pulled out his billfold. 
"Here. Give me a receipt and a 
sack." 

The clerk picked up a frying 
pan. 

"No, no," Matt said. "I don't 
want one. I just want a receipt 
and a sack." 

"But, sir," the man said bewilderedly. "You said — " 

"Don't argue with me," Matt 
said. "Just give me a receipt and 
a sack!" 

The clerk rang up the sale, tore 
off the receipt, dropped it in a 
sack, and handed it to Matt with 
a very dazed expression on his 
face. 

"Anything else, sir?" he asked 
automatically. 

"I hope not," said Matt, and 
hurried away. When he looked 
back the clerk was still staring 
after him. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



31 



A BBIE was standing by the 
stairs where he had left her. 
"Put the frying pan in here," 
he whispered. 

She gave him a look of admiration. "Oh, that was real clever of 
you." 

Matt mopped his forehead. 
"Yes, wasn't it." He took her arm 
and hurried her up the stairs. At 
the top Matt came to a halt and 
looked around. Abbie stared with 
big eyes at the racks upon racks 
of dresses. 

"I never knew," she whispered, 
"there was so many dresses in the 
world." 

Matt nodded absently. He. had 
to get away long enough to find a 
laboratory from which to rent 
some testing apparatus. 

He saw a saleswoman, and 
drew her aside. 

"The girl" over there," he said. 
"I want you to take her to the 
beauty parlor and give her the 
works. Haircut, shampoo, setting, 
facial, eyebrows thinned and 
shaped and a makeup job. Then 
get her a new outfit from the skin 
out. Can you do all that?" 

The saleswoman looked quite 
pleased. "We'll be very happy to 
help you." 

Matt took out his billfold and 
peered into it. Slowly he extracted 
one traveler's check for one hundred dollars and then another. 
It left him only three hundred 
dollars, and he still had to get 



the equipment and live for the 
rest of the summer. Matt sighed 
and countersigned the checks. 
"Try to keep it under this," he 
said heavily. "If you can." 

"Yes, sir," said the saleswoman 
and hesitated, smiling. "Your 
fiancee?" 

"Good God, no," Matt blurted 
out. "I mean — she's my — niece. 
It's her birthday." 

He walked over to Abbie, 
breathing heavily. "Go with this 
woman, Abbie, and do what she 
tells you." 

"Yes, Mr. Wright," Abbie said 
dazedly. And she walked away 
as if she were entering into fairyland. 

Matt turned, biting his lip. He 
felt slightly sick. 

TIE had one more thing to do 
before he could leave the 
store. Making sure Abbie was 
gone, he went into the lingerie 
department. He regretted it almost immediately. Once he had 
seen a woman come into a pool 
hall; he must, he thought, wear 
the same sheepish, out-of-place 
expression. 

He swallowed his qualms — 
they were a hard lump in his 
throat — and walked up to the 
counter. 

"Yes, sir," said the young woman brightly, "what can I do for 
you?" 

Matt avoided looking at her. 



32 




 



"I'd like to buy a negligee," he 
said in a low voice. 
"What size?" 

Matt began a motion with his 
hands and then dropped them 
hastily at his sides. "About five 
feet tall. Slim." 

The woman led him along the 
counter. "Any particular color?" 

"Uh — black," Matt said 
hoarsely. 

The clerk brought out a garment that was very black, very 
lacy, very sheer. "This is thirtynine ninety-eight." 

Matt stared at it. "That's awfully black," he said. 

"We have some others," the 
clerk began, folding the negligee. 

"Never mind," Matt said 
quickly. "Wrap it up." Furtively, 
he slipped the money over the 
counter. 

When he came out, the package under his arm, he was sweating freely. 

He put the box in his car and 
looked at his watch. He had 
about two and a half hours, at 
least. He should be able to find 
everything he needed in that time. 

He pulled a list of things out 
of his pocket, and found a telephone directory in a drugstore. 

OPRINGFIELD had a labora^ tory supply house. He called 
the number, asked for the equipment he'd need, was told they 
had it for rent, and drove over'to 



pick it up. The rental didn't seem 
like much by the day, but it was, 
he discovered on figuring it out, 
a lot by the month — enough to 
break him fast if he didn't get 
something like a controlled series 
of tests, very fast. 

Feeling like a child-slayer, he 
drove back to the department 
store and parked. 

Only one hour had gone by. 
He went into the store and browsed about. 

Two hours. He put another 
nickel in the parking meter. He 
sat down in a red leather chair 
and tried to look as if he were 
testing it for size and comfort. 

Three hours. He fed the parking meter again, and began to 
feel hungry. He went back to the 
chair. From it, he could keep an 
eye on the stairs. 

Women went up and came 
down. None of them were Abbie. 
He wondered, with a flash of fear, 
if she had been caught trying to 
make off with something else. 

Matt tried not watching the 
stairs on the theory that a watched pot never boils. Never again, 
he vowed, would he go shopping 
with a woman. Where the devil 
was Abbie? 

"Mr. Wright." The voice was 
tremulous and low. 

Matt looked up and leaped out 
of his chair. The girl standing 
beside him was blond and breathtaking. The hair was short and 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



33 



fluffed out at the ends; it framed 
a beautiful face. A soft, simple 
black dress with a low neckline 
clung to a small but womanly 
figure. Slim, long legs in sheer 
stockings and. small black shoes 
with towering heels. 

"Good God, Abbie! What have 
they done to you?" 

"Don't you like it?" Abbie 
asked. The lovely face clouded 
up. 

"It's — it's marvelous," Matt 
spluttered. "But they bleached 
your hair!" 

Abbie beamed. "The woman 
who worked on it called it a 
rinse. She said it was natural, but 
I should wash it every few days. 
Not with laundry soap, either." 
She sighed. "I didn't know there 
was so much a girl could do to 
her face. I've got so much to 
learn. Why, she — " 

Abbie prattled on happily while 
Matt stared at her, incredulous. 
Had he been sleeping in the same 
small cabin with this girl? Had 
she been cooking his meals and 
darning the holes in his pockets? 
Had he really kissed her and held 
her in his arms and heard her 
say. "I reckon I wouldn't be unwillin' — " 

He wondered if he would act 
the same again. 

1%/JATT had expected a difference but not such a startling 
one. She wore her clothes with a 



becoming sureness. She walked 
on the high heels as if she had 
worn them all her life. She carried herself as if she was born to 
beauty. But then, things always 
worked well for Abbie. 

Abbie opened a small black 
purse and took out five dollars 
and twenty-one cents. "The woman said I should give this back 
to you." 

Matt took it and looked at it 
in his hand and back at Abbie. 
He shrugged and smiled. "The 
power of money. Have you got 
everything?" 

Under her arm she carried a 
large package that contained, no 
doubt, the clothes and shoes she 
had worn. Matt took it from her. 
She refused to give up the package that held the frying pan. 

"I couldn't wear this," she said. 
She reached into her purse and 
pulled out something black and 
filmy. She held it up by one 
strap. "It was uncomfortable." 

Matt shot nervous glances to 
the right and the left. "Put it 
away." He crammed it back into 
the purse and snapped the purse 
shut. "Are you hungry?" 

"I could eat a hog," Abbie said. 

Coming from this blonde creature, the incongruity set Matt to 
laughing. Abbie stared with wide 
eyes. "Did I say something 
wrong?" she asked plaintively. 

v "No." Matt got out and led her 
toward the door. 



34 




 



"You got to tell me," Abbie 
said appealingly. "There's so 
much I don't know." 

Matt located the most expensive restaurant in town. It had a 
romantic atmosphere but he had 
chosen it because it specialized in 
sea food. He wanted to be sure 
that Abbie had things to eat she 

had never tasted before. 

i 

Matt ordered for both of them : 
shrimp cocktail, assorted relishes, chef's salad with roquefort 
dressing, broiled lobster tails with 
drawn butter, french fried potatoes, broccoli with a cheese 
sauce, frozen eclair, coffee. The 
food was good, and Abbie ate 
everything with great wonderment, as if it were about to disappear into the mysterious place 
from which it came. 

She stared wide-eyed at the 
room and its decorations and the 
other diners and the waiter, and 
seemed oblivious of the fact that 
other men were staring admiringly at her. The waiter puzzled her. 
"Is this all he does?" she asked 
timidly. Matt nodded. "He's very 
good at it," Abbie conceded. 

"Try to move the coffee cup," 
Matt said when they finished. 

Abbie stared at it for a moment. 
"I can't," she said softly. "I tried 
awful — very hard, but I can't. 
I'd do anything you wanted, Mr. 
Wright, but I can't do that." 

Matt smiled. "That's all right. 
I just wanted to see if you could." 



"R/I'ATT found a place tfley 
could dance. He ordered a 
couple of drinks. Abbie sipped 
hers once, made a face, and 
wouldn't touch it again. 

She danced lightly and gracefully in her high-heeled shoes. 
They brought the top of her head 
level with his lips. She rested her 
head blissfully against his shoulder and pressed herself very close. 
For a moment Matt relaxed and 
let himself enjoy the pleasures of 
the aftermath of a good meal and 
a beautiful girl in his arms. But 
Abbie seemed to be in a private 
Eden of her own, as if she had 
entered a paradise and was afraid 
to speak for fear the spell would 
break. 

During the long drive home, 
she spoke only once. "Do people 
live like that all the time?" 

"No," Matt said. "Not always. 
Not unless they have a lot of 
money." 

Abbie nodded. "That's the way 
it should be," she said softly. "It 
should only happen a long ways 
apart." 

When they reached the cabin, 
Matt reached into the back seat 
for the package he had bought. 

"What's that?" Abbie asked. 

"Open it," Matt said. 

She held it up a little, lacy and 
black in the moonlight. Then she 
turned to look at Matt, her face 
transparent, her eyes glowing. 
"Wait out here a minute, will 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



35 



you?" she asked breathlessly. 

"All right." Matt lit a cigarette 
and stood on the porch looking 
out over the valley, hating himself. 

After a few minutes, he heard 
a little whisper. "Come in, Mr. 
Wright." 

TTE opened the door started in 
and stopped, stunned. One 
kerosene lamp lit the room dimly. 
The new clothes were draped 
carefully over the edge of a chair. 
Abbie was wearing the negligee. 
That was all. Through its lacy 
♦ blackness she gleamed pink and 
white, a lovely vision of seductiveness. She stood by the table, 
staring at the floorr When she 
looked up, her cheeks were 
flushed. 

Suddenly she ran lightly across 
the floor and threw her arms 
around Mart's neck and kissed 
him hard on the lips. Her lips 
moved. She drew back a little, 
looking up at him. 

"There's only one way a girl 
like me can thank a man for a 
day as wonderful as this," she 
whispered. "For the clothes and 
the trip and the dinner and the 
dancing. And for being so nice. 
I never thought anything like this 
would ever happen to me. I don't 
mind. I guess it isn't bad when 
you really like someone. I like 
you awful — very well. I'm glad 
they made me pretty. If I can 



make you happy — just for a 
moment — " 

Gently, feeling sick, Matt took 
her hands from around his neck. 
"You don't understand," he said 
coldly. "I've done a terrible thing. 
I don't know how you can ever 
forgive me. Somehow you misunderstood me. Those clothes, the 
negligee — they're for another 
girl — the girl I'm going to marry 
— my fiancee. You're about her 
size and I thought — I don't 
know how I could have misled . . ." 

He stopped. It was enough. His 
plan had worked. Abbie had 
crumpled. Slowly, as he spoke, 
the life had drained out of her, 
the glow had fled from her face, 
and she seemed to shrink in upon 
herself, cold and broken. She was 
a little girl, slapped across the 
face in her most spiritual moment 
by the one person she had trusted 
most. 

"That's all right," she said 
faintly. "Thanks for letting me 
think they was mine — that it 
was for me — only for a little. 
I'll never forget." 

She turned and went to the 
bunk and let the blanket fall 
back around her. 

It was the sobbing that kept 
Matt from going to sleep that 
night. Or maybe it was the way 
the sobs were so soft and muffled 
that he had to strain to hear 
them. 



36 




 



"DREAKFAST was a miserable 
meal. There was something 
wrong with the food, although 
Matt couldn't quite pin down 
what it was. Everything was 
cooked just the same, but the 
flavor was gone. Matt cut and 
chewed mechanically and tried 
to avoid looking at Abbie. It 
wasn't difficult; she seemed very 
small today, and she kept her 
eyes on the floor. 

She was dressed in the shapeless blue gingham once more. She 
toyed listlessly with her food. Her 
face was scrubbed free of makeup, and everything about her was 
dull. Even her newly blonde hair 
had faded. 

Several times Matt opened his 
mouth to apologize again, and 
shut it without saying anything. 
Finally he cleared his throat and 
said, "Where's your new frying 
pan?" 

She looked up for the first time. 
Her blue eyes were cloudy. "I 
put it away," she said lifelessly, 
"do you want it back?" 

"No, no," Matt said hurriedly. 
"I was just asking." 

Silence fell again, like a sodden 
blanket. Matt sat and chainsmoked while Abbie cleaned up 
the table and washed the dishes. 

When she finished she turned 
around with her back to the dishpan. "Do you want me to move 
things for you? I can do it real 
good today." 



Matt saw the little pile of packages in the corner and noticed 
for the first time that the new 
clothes were gone. He steeled 
himself. "How do you know?" 

"I got a feeling." 

"Do you mind?" 

"I don't mind. I don't mind 
anything." She came forward and 
sat down in the chair. "Look!" 

The table between them lifted, 
twisted, tilted on one leg, and 
crashed on its side to the floor. 

"How did you feel?" Matt said 
excitedly. "Can you control the 
power? Was the movement accidental?" 

"It felt like it was kind of a 
part of me," Abbie said. "Like 
my hand. But I didn't know exactly what it was going to do." 

"Wait a minute," Matt said. 
"I'm going to get some things out 
of the car. Maybe we can learn a 
little more about what makes you 
able to do things like this. You 
don't mind, do you?" 

"What's the good of it?" she 
asked listlessly. 

Matt dashed out to the car and 
pulled the two cartons of equipment out of the trunk. He carried 
them into the shack and laid the 
apparatus out on the table. He 
went back to the car and brought 
in the bathroom scales he'd 
bought in the drugstore in Springfield. 

"All right, Abbie. First, let's 
find out a few things about you 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



37 



before we try moving anything 
else." 

Abbie complied automatically 
while he took her temperature 
and pulse, measured her blood 
pressure and weighed her. "I wish 
I could set up controls to measure 
your basal metabolism," he muttered as he worked, "but this will 
have to do. I wish this shack had 
a generator." 

"I could get you electricity," 
Abbie said without much interest. 

"Hmmm — you could at that, 
I guess. But that would make 
these tests meaningless, if you 
had to devote energy to keeping 
the equipment running." 

TTE cursed the limited knowledge that was undoubtedly 
making him miss things that a 
man who had studied longer 
would have know more about. 

But there wasn't anything he 
could do about that. Once he'd 
reached some preliminary conclusions, more experienced researchers could take over the job. 

Working carefully, he wrote 
down the results. 

"Now, Abbie, would you please 
pick that chair up off the floor, 
and hold it up for a few minutes? 
No — I mean really go over and 
pick it up." 

He let her hold it for exactly 
five minutes, then ran her through 
the same tests as before, noting 
the changes in temperature, blood 



pressure, pulse rate, respiration, 
and then he weighed her again. 

"All right. Take a rest now. 
We'll have to wait until these 
readings drop down to what they 
were before we do anything else," 
Matt said. 

Still not displaying anything 
more than acquiescence, Abbie 
sat down in another chair and 
stared at the floor. 

"Abbie, do you mind helping 
me?" Matt asked. "It's for your 
benefit, too. If you can control 
these powers all the time, maybe 
the fellows around here will stop 
breaking legs and falling into 
lakes." 

Abbie's dull expression did not 
change. "I don't care," she said. 

Matt sighed. For a moment, he 
considered dropping his experiments and just getting out of 
Abbie's life — packing his thesis 
notes and typewriter in the car 
and driving back to the University. But he couldn't stop now. He 
was too close to the beginnings of 
an answer. 

He checked Abbie again, and 
found that his readings coincided 
with the first set. The short rest 
had dropped her heartbeat and 
respiration back to normal. 

"Let's try all over again," Matt 
said. "Lift that chair to the same 
height you were holding it, 
please." 

The chair jerked upward, hesitantly. "Easy. Just a little more." 



38 




 



It straightened, then moved more 
steadily. "Hold it there." The 
chair hovered motionless in the 
air, maintaining its position. Matt 
waited five minutes. "All right. 
Let it down now, easy. Slow." 
The chair settled gently to the 
floor, like a drifting feather. 

Once more, he checked Abbie. 

Her heartbeat was below what 
it had been. Her blood pressure 
was lower. Her respiration was 
shallow — her breast was barely 
rising to each breath. Her temperature was low — dangerously so, 
for an ordinary human being. 

"How do you feel?" he asked 
apprehensively. If this was what 
always happened, then Abbie was 
in real danger every time she used 
her powers. 

"All right," she said with no 
more than her previous disinterest. Matt frowned, but she was 
showing no signs of discomfort. 

"Are you sure?" he asked. 

"Yes," she said. "You want me 
to try some more?" 

"If you're sure you're not in 
danger. But I want you to stop 
if you feel any pain or if you're 
uncomfortable. Now, lift the table 
just this far . . ." 

HPHEY practiced with the table 
for an hour. At the end of that 
time, Abbie had it under perfect 
control. She could raise it a fraction of an inch or rocket it to the 
ceiling where it would remain, 



legs pointing stiffly toward the 
floor, until she lowered it. She 
balanced it on one leg and set it 
spinning like a top. 

Distance did not seem to diminish Abbie's control or power. 
She could make the table perform equally well from any point 
in the room, from outside the 
cabin, or from a point to which 
she shuffled dispiritedly several 
hundred yards down the road. 

"How do you know where it is 
and what it's doing?" Matt asked 
frowning. 

Abbie shrugged listlessly. "I 
just feel it." 

"With what?" Matt asked. "Do 
you see it? Feel it? Sense it? If 
we could isolate the sense — " 

"It's all of those," Abbie said. 

Matt shook his head in frustration. "You look a little tired. 
You'd better lie down." 

She lay in her bunk, not moving, her face turned to the wall, 
but Matt knew that she wasn't 
asleep. When she didn't get up to 
fix lunch, Matt opened a can of 
soup and tried to get her to eat 
some of it. 

"No, thanks, Mr. Wright," 
Abbie said. "I ain't hungry." 

"I'm not hungry," Matt corrected. 

Abbie didn't respond. In the 
evening she got out of her bunk 
to fix supper, but she didn't eat 
more than a few mouthfuls. After 
she washed the dishes, she went 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



39 



back into her bunk and pulled 
the blanket around it. 

Matt sat up, trying to make 
sense out of his charts. Despite 
their readings, Abbie hadn't reacted dangerously to what should 
have been frightening physiological changes. He could be fairly 
safe in assuming that they always 
accompanied the appearance of 
her parapsychological powers — 
and she had certainly lived 
through those well enough. 

But why was there such a difference in the way she reacted 
when she was happy and when 
she wasn't? The first morning, 
when she had barely been able 
to assume conscious control, she'd 
been ravenously hungry. Today, 
when she had performed feats 
that made the others insignificant 
she was neither hungry nor abnormally exhausted. She was 
tired, yes, but there had been a 
measurable, though slight, expenditure of energy with each action, which, accumulated through 
their numerous experiments, 
could be expected to equal that 
required for an afternoon's normal work. 

What was different? Why, 
when she tried with what amounted to will-power alone, was it 
harder for her to move an object 
telekinetically than it would have 
been to do so physically? Why 
was the reverse true when she 
was unhappy? 



Unless she was tapping a source 
of energy somewhere. 

The thought sounded as though 
there might be something behind 
it. He reached for a blank sheet 
of paper and began jotting down 
ideas. 

Disregarding the first morning's 
experiments, when she was obviously succeeding despite this 
hypothetical force, what source 
of energy could she be contacting? 

Well, what physical laws was 
she violating? Gravity? Inertia? 

Tf[7HEN Abbie was unhappy, 
* ' she could nullify gravity — 
no, not exactly gravity — mass. 
Once she had done that, a process that might not require much 
energy at all, the object rose by 
itself, and, having no mass, could 
be pushed around easily. Somehow, by some unconscious mechanism, she could restore measured 
amounts of mass and — there 
was an idea trying to come to the 
surface of his thinking — of 
course ! The energy created by the 
moving or falling body when 
mass , was restored and gravity 
re-asserted itself was channeled 
into her body. She stopped being 
a chemical engine sustained by 
food burned in the presence of 
oxygen, and became a receiver 
for the power generated by the 
moving bodies. 

Writing quickly, he systemat


40 




 



ized what he had learned. Obviously, the energy restored when 
the manipulated objects fell or 
swooped back into place couldn't 
quite balance the energy required 
to move them. She did get tired 
— but nowhere near as tired as 
she should have been. If she empathized with her feelings at such 
times, she retained a bare margin 
of control even when happy, but 
she lost the delicate ability to tap 
the energy thus liberated, and had 
to draw on her own body for the 
power. 

Matt grimaced. If that was true 
— and his charts and graph confirmed it, then she could never use 
her powers unless she was miserable. 

And the key to that lay buried 
in the childhood of a little hill 
girl, who probably had been 
scolded and beaten, as hill children were when they were bad. 
In this case 'bad' meaning a little 
girl who could move things without touching them, who had been 
confronted with the example of 
'Libby,' the perfect little girl who 
would, always have minded her 
mother, until she had come to 
associate the use of her powers 
only with unhappiness, with not 
being wanted, with rejection on 
the part of the people whom she 
loved. 

Matt winced. You louse, 
Wright! 

But it was too late to do any


thing about it now. He had to 
go on with what he was doing. 

A BBIE'S appetite wasn't any 
better in the morning. She 
looked tired, too, as if she hadn't 
slept. Matt stared at her for 
a moment thoughtfully, then 
shrugged and put her to work. 

In a few minutes, Abbie could 
duplicate her feats with the table 
of the day before with a control 
that was, if anything, even finer. 
Matt extended his experiment 
to her subjective reactions. 

"Let's isolate the source," he 
said. "Relax. Try to do it with 
the mind alone. Will the table to 
move." 

Matt jotted down notes. At the 
end of half an hour he had the 
following results: 

Mind alone — negative. 

Body alone — negative. 

Emotions alone — negative. 

It was crude and uncertain. It 
would take days or months of 
practice to be able to use the 
mind without a sympathetic tension of the body, or to stop thinking or to wall off an emotion. 
But Matt was fairly sure that the 
telekinetic ability was a complex 
of all three and perhaps some others that he had no way of knowing about, which Abbie couldn't 
describe. But if any of the primary three were inhibited, consciously or unconsciously, Abbie 
could not move a crumb of bread. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



41 



Two of them could be controlled. The third was a product 
of environment and circumstances. Abbie had to be unhappy. 

A muscle twitched in Mart's 
jaw, and he told Abbie to try 
moving more than one object. 
He saw a cup of coffee rise in the 
air, turn a double somersault 
without spilling a drop, and sit 
down gently in the saucer that 
climbed to meet it. Matt stood 
up, picked the cup out of the air, 
drank the coffee, and put the cup 
back. The saucer did not wobble. 

There were limits to Abbie's 
ability. The number of dissimilar 
objects she could manipulate 
seemed to be three, regardless of 
size; she could handle five similar 
objects with ease, and she had 
made six slices of bread do an 
intricate dance in the air. It was 
possible, of course, that she might 
improve with practice. 

"My God!" Matt exclaimed. 
"You could make a fortune as a 
magician." 

"Could I?" Abbie said without 
interest. She pleaded a headache 
and went to bed. Matt said nothing. They had worked for an hour 
and a half. 

Matt lit a cigarette. The latent 
telekinetic power could explain a 
lot of things, poltergeist phenomena, for instance, and in a more 
conscious form, levitation and the 
Indian rope trick and the whole 
gamut of oriental mysticism. 

42 



He spent the rest of the day 
making careful notes of everything Abbie did, the date and 
time, the object and its approximate weight and its movements. 
When he finished, he would have 
a complete case history. Complete except for the vital parts 
which he did not dare put down 
on paper. 

Several times he turned to stare 
at Abbie's still, small form. He 
was only beginning to realize the 
tremendous potentialities locked 
up within her. His awareness had 
an edge of fear. What role was it 
he'd chosen for himself. He had 
been fairy godmother, but that no 
longer. Pygmalion? He felt a 
little like Pandora must have 
felt before she opened the box. 
Or, perhaps, he thought ruefully, 
he was more like Doctor Frankenstein. 

A BBIE did not get up at all 
that day, and she refused to 
eat anything Matt fixed. Next 
morning, when she climbed slovrly from her bunk, his apprehension sharpened. 

She was gaunt, and her face 
had a middle-aged, haggard look. 
Her blond hair was dull and lifeless. Matt had already cooked 
breakfast, but she only went 
through the motions of eating. 
He urged her, but she put her 
fork down tiredly. 

"It don't matter," she said. 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"Maybe you're sick," Matt 
fretted. "We'll take you to a 
doctor." 

Abbie looked at Matt levelly 
and shook her head. "What's 
wrong with me, a doctor won't 
fix." 

That was the morning Matt 
saw a can of baking powder pass 
through his chest. Abbie had been 
tossing it to Matt at various 
speeds, gauging the strength of 
the push necessary. Matt would 
either catch it or Abbie would 
stop it short and bring it back to 
her. But this time it came too 
fast, bullet-like. Involuntarily, 
Matt looked down, tensing his 
body for the impact. 

He saw the can go in . . . 

Abbie's eyes were wide and 
frightened. Matt turned around 
dazedly, prodding his chest with 
trembling fingers. The can had 
shattered against the cabin wall 
behind him. It lay on the floor, 
battered, in a drift of powder. 

"It went in," Matt said. "I 
saw it, but I didn't feel a thing. 
It passed right through me. What 
happened, Abbie?" 

"I couldn't stop it," she whispered, "so I just sort of wishe 1 
it wasn't there. For just a moment. And it wasn't." 

That was how they found out 
that Abbie could teleport. It was 
as simple as telekinesis. She co.'ld 
project or pull objects through 
walls without hurting either one. 



Little things, big things. It made 
no difference. Distance made no 
difference either, apparently. 

"What about living things?" 
Matt asked. 

Abbie concentrated. Suddenly 
there was a mouse on the table, 
a brown field mouse with twitching whiskers and large, startled 
black eyes. For a moment it 
crouched there, frozen, and then 
it scampered for the edge of the 
table, straight toward Abbie. 

Abbie screamed and reacted. 
Twisting in the air, the mouse 
vanished. Matt looked up, his 
mouth hanging open. Abbie was 
three feet in the air, hovering like 
a hummingbird. Slowly she sank 
down to her chair. 

"It works on people, too," 
Matt whispered. "Try it again. 
Try it on me." 

~]%/|~ATT felt nauseated, as if he 
had suddenly stepped off the 
Earth. The room shifted around 
him. He looked down. He was 
floating in the air about two feet 
above the chair he had been sitting on. He was turning slowly, 
so that the room seemed to revolve around him. 

He looked for Abbie, but she 
was behind him now. Slowly she 
drifted into view. "That's fine," 
he said. Abbie looked happier 
than she had looked for days. 
She almost smiled. 

Matt began to turn more rapid


WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



43 



ly. In a moment he was spinning 
like a top; the room flashed into 
a kaleidoscope. He swallowed 
hard. ' "All right," he shouted, 
"that's enough." 

Abruptly he stopped spinning 
and dropped. His stomach soared 
up into his throat. He thumped 
solidly into the chair and immediately hopped up with a howl 
of anguish. He rubbed himself 
with both hands. 

"Ouch!" he shouted. And then 
accusingly, "You did that on 
purpose." 

Abbie looked innocent. "I done 
what you said." 

"All right, you did," Matt said 
bitterly. "From now on, I resign 
as a guinea pig." 

Abbie folded her hands in her 
lap. "What shall I do? 

"Practice on yourself," Matt 
said. 

"Yes, Mr. Wright." She rose 
sedately in the air. "This is wonderful." She stretched out as if 
she were laying in bed. She floated 
around the room. Matt was reminded of shows in which he had 
seen magicians producing the 
same illusion, passing hoops 
cleverly around their assistant's 
body to show that there were no 
wires. Only this wasn't magic; 
this wasn't illusion; this was real. 

Abbie settled back into the 
chair. Her face was glowing. "I 
feel like I could do anything," 
she said. "Now what shall I try." 



Matt thought a moment. "Can 
you project yourself?" 
"Where to?" 

"Oh, anywhere," Matt said impatiently. "It doesn't matter." 

"Anywhere?" she repeated. 
There was a distant and unreadable expression in her eyes. 

And then she vanished. 

Matt stared at the chair she 
had been in. She was gone, indisputably gone. He searched the 
room, a simple process. There was 
no sign of her. He went outside. 
The afternoon sun beat down, 
exposing everything in a harsh 
light. 

"Abbie!" Matt shouted. "Abbie!" He waited. He heard only 
the echo drifting back from the 
hills across the lake. For five 
minutes he roamed about the 
cabin, shouting and calling, before he gave up. 

He went back into the cabin. 
He sat down and stared moodily 
at the bunk where Abbie had / 
slept. Where was she now? Was 
she trapped in some extra dimension, weird and inexplicable to 




WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



the senses, within which her 
power could not work. 

There had to be some such 
explanation for teleportation — 
a fourth dimensional shortcut 
across our three. Why not — if 
she could nullify mass, she could 
adjust atoms so that they entered one of the other dimensions. 

A S he brooded, remorse came 
to him slowly, creeping in so 
stealthily that awareness of it was 
like a blow. The whole scheme 
had been madness. He could not 
understand now the insane ambition that had led to this tinkering with human lives and the 
structure of the Universe. He had 
justified it to himself with the 
name of science. But the word 
had no mystic power of absolution. 

His motive had been something 
entirely different. It was only a 
sublimated lust for power, and 
thinly disguised at that. The 
power, of knowledge. And for 
that lust, which she could never 
understand, an innocent, unsophisticated girl had suffered. 

Was Abbie dead? Perhaps that 
was the most merciful thing. 

Ends can never justify means, 
Matt realized now. They are too 
inextricably intertwined ever to 
be separated. The means inevitably shape the ends. In the long 
view, there are neither means nor 



ends, for the means are only an 
infinite series of ends, and the 
ends are an infinite series of 
means . . . 

And Abbie appeared. Like an 
Arabian genie, with gifts upon a 
tray, streaming a mouth-watering 
incense through the air. Fullformed, she sprang into being, her 
cheeks glowing, her eyes shining. 

"Abbie!" Matt shouted joyfully. His heart gave a sharp 
bound, as if it had suddenly been 
released from an unbearable 
weight. "Where have you been?" 

"Springfield." 

"Springfield!" Matt gasped. 
"But that's over fifty miles." 

Abbie lowered the tray to the 
table. She snapped her fingers. 
"Like that, I was there." 

Matt's eyes fell to the tray. It 
was loaded with cooked food: 
shrimp cocktail, broiled lobster 
tails, french fried . . . 

Abbie smiled. "I got hungry." 

"But where — ?" Matt began. 
"You went back to the restaurant," he said accusingly, "you 
took the food from there." 

Abbie nodded happily. "I was 
hungry." 

"But that's stealing," Matt 
moaned. And he realized for the 
first time the enormity of the 
thing he had done, what he had 
let loose upon the world. Nothing 
was safe. Neither money nor 
jewels nor deadly secrets. Nothing at all.

"They won't ever miss it," Abbie said, "and nobody saw me." 
She said it simply, as the ultimate 
justification. 

Matt was swept by the staggering realization that where her 
basic drives were concerned Abbie 
was completely unmoral. There 
was only one small hope. If he 
could keep her from realizing her 
civilization-shattering potentialities! They might never occur to 
her. 

"Sure," Matt said. "Sure." 

Abbie ate heartily, but Matt 
had no appetite. He sat thoughtfully, watching her eat, and he 
experienced a brief thankfulness 
that at least she wasn't going to 
starve to death. 

"Didn't you have any trouble?" 
he asked. "Getting the food without anyone seeing you?" 

Abbie nodded. "I couldn't decide how to get into the kitchen. 
I could see that the cook was all 
alone . . ." 

"You could see?" 

"I was outside, but I could see 
into the kitchen, somehow. So 
finally, I called 'Albert!' And the 
cook went out and I went in and 
took the food that was sitting on 
the tray and came back here. 
It was really simple, because the 
cook was expecting someone to 
call him." 

"How did you know that?" 

"I thought it," Abbie said, 
frowning. "Like this." 



SHE concentrated for a moment. He watched her, puzzled, and then knew what she 
meant. Panic caught him by the 
throat. There were things she 
shouldn't know. Because he was 
trying so hard to bury them deep, 
they scuttled across his consciousness. 

Telepathy! 

And as he watched her face, he 
knew that he was right. 

Her eyes grew wide and incredulous. Slowly, something 
hard and cruelly cold slipped over 
her face like a mask. 

Oh, Abbie! My sweet, gentle 
Abbie! 

"You — " she gasped. "You 
devil! There ain't nothin' too bad 
for anyone who'd do that!" 

I'm a dead man, Matt thought. 

"You with your kindness and 
your handsome face and your city 
manners," Abbie said pitifully. 
"How could you do it? You made 
me fall in love with you. It wasn't 
hard, was it? All you had to do 
was hold a little hill girl's hand 
in the moonlight an' kiss her 
once, an' she was ready to jump 
into bed with you. But you didn't 
want anything as natural as that. 
All the time you was laughing 
and scheming. Poor little hill girl! 

"You make me think you like 
me so well you want me to look 
real purty in new clothes and new 
hair and a new face. But it's just 
a trick. All the time it's a trick. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



47 



When I'm feeling happiest and 
most grateful, you take it all 
away. I'd sooner you hit me 
across the face. Poor little hill 
girl! Thinking you wanted her. 
Thinking maybe you were aiming 
to marry her. I wanted to die. 
Even Paw was never that mean. 
He never done anything a-purpose, like you." 

White-faced, Matt watched her, 
his mind racing. 

"You're thinking you can get 
around me somehow," Abbie 
said, "and I'll forget. You can 
make me think it was all a mistake. 'Tain't no use. You can't, 
not ever, because I know what 
you're thinking." 

What had he been thinking? 
Had he actually thought of marrying her? Just for a second? He 
shuddered. It would be hell. 
Imagine, if you can, a wife whois all-knowing, all-powerful, who 
can never be evaded, avoided, 
sighed to, lied to, shut out, shut 
up. Imagine a wife who can make 
a room a shambles in a second, 
who can throw dishes and chairs 
and tables with equal facility and 
deadly accuracy. Imagine a wife 
who can be any place, any time, 
in the nicker of a suspicion. 
Imagine a wife who can see 
through walls and read minds 
and maybe wish you a raging 
headache or a broken leg or aching joints. 

It would be worse than hell. 



The torments of the damned 
would be pleasant compared to 
that. 

Abbie's chin came up. "You 
don't need to worry. I'd as soon 
marry up with a rattlesnake. At 
least he gives you warning before 
he strikes." 

"Kill me!" Matt said desperately. "Go ahead and kill me!" 

Abbie smiled sweetly. "Killing's 
too good for you. I don't know 
anything that ain't too good for 
you. But don't worry, I'll think of 
something. Now, go away and 
leave me alone." 

rpHANKFULLY, Matt started 
to turn. Before he could complete it, he found himself outside 
the cabin. He blinked in the light 
of the sinking sun. He began to 
shiver. After a little he sat down 
on the porch and lit a cigarette. 
There had to be some way out of 
this. There was always a way. 

From inside the cabin came the 
sound of running water. Running 
water! Matt resisted an impulse 
to get up and investigate the 
mystery. "Leave me alone," Abbie had said, in a tone that Matt 
didn't care to challenge. 

A few minutes later he heard 
the sound of splashing and Abbie's voice lifted in a sweet soprano. Although he couldn't understand the words, the tune sent 
chills down his back. And then a 
phrase came clear: 



48 




 



Root-a-toot-toot 

Three times she did shoot 

Right through that hardwood 

door. 
He was her man, 
But he done her wrong . . . 

Matt began to shake. He passed 
a trembling hand across his 
sweaty forehead and wondered if 
he had a fever. He tried to pull 
himself together for he had to 
think clearly. The situation was 
obvious. He had done a fiendishly 
cruel thing — no matter what the 
excuse — and he had been caught 
and the power of revenge was in 
the hands of the one he had 
wronged, never more completely. 

The only question was: what 
form would the revenge take? 
When he knew that, he might be 
able to figure out a way to evade 
it. There was no question in his 
mind about waiting meekly for 
justice to strike. 

The insurmountable difficulty 
was that the moment he thought 
of a plan, it would be unworkable because Abbie would be 
forewarned. And she was already 
armed. He had to stop thinking. 

How do you stop thinking? he 
thought miserably. Srop thinking! he told himself. Stop thinking, damn you! 

He might be on the brink of 
the perfect solution. But if he 
thought of it, it would be worthless. And if he couldn't think of 



it, then — 

The circle was complete. He 
was back where he started, staring at its perfect viciousness. 
There was only one possi — 

Mary had a little Iamb with 
fleece as white as snow and everywhere that Mary went (Relax!) 
the lamb (Don't think!) was sure 
(Act on the spur of the moment) 
to go. Mary had a . . . 

"Well, Mr. Wright, are you 
ready to go?" 

Matt started. Beside him were 
a pair of black suede shoes filled 
with small feet. His gaze traveled 
up the lovely, nylon-sheathed 
legs, up the clinging black dress 
that swelled so provocatively, to 
the face with its blue eyes and red 
lips and blond hair. 

Even in his pressing predicament, Matt had to recognize the 
impact of her beauty. It was a 
pity that her other gifts were too 
terrible. 

"I reckon your fiancee won't 
mind," Abbie said sweetly. "Being as you ain't got a fiancee. Are 
you ready?" 

"Ready?" Matt looked down at 
his soiled work clothes. "For 
what?" 

"You're ready," Abbie said. 

A WAVE of dizziness swept 
him, followed by a wave of 
nausea. Matt shut his eyes. They 
receded. When he opened his eyes 
again, he had a frightening sensa


WHEREVER YOU MAY BE

tion of disorientation. Then he 
recognized his surroundings. He 
was on the dance floor in Springfield. 

Abbie came into his arms. "All 
right," she said, "dance!" 

Shocked, Matt began to dance, 
mechanically. He realized that 
people were staring at them as if 
they had dropped through a hole 
in the ceiling. Matt wasn't sure 
they hadn't. Only two other 
couples were on the small floor, 
but they had stopped dancing and 
were looking puzzled. 

As Matt swung Abbie slowly 
around he saw that the sprinkling 
of customers at the bar had 
turned to stare, too. A waiter in a 
white jacket was coming toward 
them, frowning determinedly. 

Abbie seemed as unconcerned 
about the commotion she had 
caused as the rainbow-hued juke 
box in the corner. It thumped 
away just below Matt's conscious 
level of recognition. Abbie danced 
lightly in his arms. 

The waiter tapped Matt on the 
shoulder. Matt sighed with relief 
and stopped dancing. Immediately he found himself moving jerkily around the floor like a puppet. 
Abbie, he gathered, did not care 
to stop. 

The waiter followed doggedly. 
"Stop that!" he said bewilderedly. 
"I don't know where you came 
from or what you think you're 
doing, but you can't do it in here 



and you can't do it dressed like 
that." 

"\ — I c-can-n't s-st-stop-p!" 
Matt said jerkily. 

"Sure you can," the waiter said 
soothingly. He plodded along 
after them. "There's lots of things 
a man can't do, but he can always 
stop whatever you're doing. I 
should think you'd be glad to 
stop." 

"W-w-would," Matt got out. 
"S-st-stop-p!" he whispered to 
Abbie. 

"Tell the man to go 'way," 
Abbie whispered back. 

Matt decided to start dancing 
again. It was easier than being 
shaken to pieces. "I think you'd 
better go away," he said to the 
waiter. 

"We don't like to use force," the 
waiter said, frowning, "but we 
have to keep up a standard for 
our patrons. Come along quietly," 
he jerked on Matt's arm "or — " 

The grip on Matt's arm was 
suddenly gone. The waiter vanished. Matt looked around wildly. 

The juke box had a new decoration. Dazed, opaque-eyed, the 
waiter squatted on top of the 
box, his white jacket and whiter 
face a dark fool's motley in the 
swirling lights. 

Abbie pressed herself close. 
Matt shuddered and swung her 
slowly around the floor. On the 
next turn, he saw that the waiter 
had climbed down from his perch. 



50 




 



He had recruited reinforcements. 
Grim-faced and silent, the waiter 
approached, followed by another 
waiter, a lantern- jawed bartender, 
and an ugly bulldog of a man in 
street clothes. The manager, Matt 
decided. 

They formed a menacing ring 
around Matt and Abbie. 

"Whatever your game is," 
growled the bulldog, "we don't 
want to play. If you don't leave 
damn quick, you're going to wish 
you had." 

Matt, looking at him, believed 
it. He tried to stop. Again his 
limbs began to jerk uncontrollably. 

"I-I c-can-n't," he said. "D-ddon't y-you th-think I-I w-would 
if I-I c-could." 

The manager stared at him 
with large, awed, bloodshot eyes. 
"Yeah," he said. "I guess you 
would." He shook himself. His 
jowls wobbled. "Okay, boys. Let's 
get rid of them." 

"Watch yourself," said the first 
waiter uneasily. "One of them has 
a trick throw." 

They closed in. Matt felt Abbie 
stiffen against him. 

HPHEY vanished, one after the 
other, like candles being 
snuffed. Matt glanced unhappily 
at the juke box. There they were 
on top of the box, stacked in 
each other's laps like a totem 
pole. The pile teetered and col


lapsed in all directions. Dull 
thuds made themselves heard 
even above the juke box. 

Matt saw them get up, puzzled and wary. The bartender 
was rubbing his nose. He doubled 
his fists and started to rush out 
on the floor. The manager, a 
wilier sort, grabbed his arm. The 
four of them went into consultation. Every few seconds one of 
them would raise his head and 
stare at Matt and Abbie. Finally 
the first waiter detached himself 
from the group and with an air of 
finality reached behind the juke 
box. Abruptly the music stopped; 
the colored lights went out. Silence fell. The four of them turned 
triumphantly toward the floor. 

Just as' abruptly, the lights 
went back on; the music boomed 
out again. They jumped. 

Defiantly, the manager stepped 
to the wall and pulled the plug 
from the socket. He turned, still 
holding the cord. It stirred in his 
hand. The manager looked down 
at it incredulously. It wriggled. 
He dropped it hurriedly, with revulsion. The plug rose cobralike 
from its coils and began a slow, 
deadly, weaving dance. The manager stared, hypnotized with disbelief. 

The cord struck. The manager 
leaped back. The bared, metal 
fangs bit into the floor. They 
retreated, all four of them, watching with wide eyes. Contemptu


WHEREVER YOU MAY BE

ously, the cord turned its back 
on them, wriggled its way to the 
socket, and plugged itself in. 

The music returned. Matt 
danced on with leaden legs. He 
could not stop. He would never 
stop. He thought of the fairy tale 
of the red shoes. Abbie seemed 
as fresh and determined as ever. 

As the juke box came into sight 
again, Matt noticed some commotion around it. The bartender 
was approaching the manager 
with an axe, a glittering fire axe. 
For one whirling moment, Matt 
thought the whole world had gone 
mad. Then he saw the manager 
take the axe and approach the 
juke box cautiously, the axe 
poised in one hand ready to 
strike. 

He brought it down smartly. 
The cord squirmed its coils out 
of the way. The manager 
wrenched the axe from the floor. 
Bravely he advanced closer. He 
looked down and screamed. The 
cord had a loop around one leg; 
the loop was tightening. Frantically the manager swung again and 
again. One stroke hit the cord 
squarely. It parted. The music 
stopped. The box went dark. The 
headless cord squirmed in dying 
agonies. 

Abbie stopped dancing. Matt 
stood still, his legs trembling, 
sighing with relief. 

"Let's go, Abbie," he pleaded. 
"Let's go quick." 



She shook her head. "Let's sit." 
She led him to a table which, 
like the rest of the room, had 
been suddenly vacated of patrons. 
"I reckon you'd like a drink." 

"I'd rather leave," Matt muttered. 

'T'HEY sat down. Imperiously, 
Abbie beckoned at the waiter. 
He came toward the table cautiously. Abbie looked inquiringly 
at Matt. 

"Bourbon," Matt said helplessly. "Straight." 

In a moment the waiter was 
back with a bottle and two glasses 
on a tray. "The boss said to get 
the money first," he said timidly. 

Matt searched his pockets futilely. He looked at the manager, 
standing against one wall, glowering, his arms folded across his 
chest. "I haven't got any money 
on me," Matt said. 

"That's all right," Abbie said. 
"Just set the things down." 

"No, ma'am," the waiter began, 
and his eyes rolled as the tray 
floated out of his hand and settled to the table. He stopped talking, shut his mouth, and backed 
away. 

Abbie was brooding, her chin 
in one small hand. "I ain't been a 
good daughter," she said. "Paw 
would like it here." 

"No, no," Matt said hurriedly. 
"Don't do that. We've got enough 
trouble — "

Jenkins was sitting in the third 
chair, blinking slowly, reeking of 
alcohol. Matt reached for the bottle and sloshed some into a glass. 
He raised it to his lips and tossed 
it off. The liquor burned his 
throat for a moment and then was 
gone. Matt waited expectantly as 
he lowered the glass to the table. 
He felt nothing, nothing at all. 
He looked suspiciously at the 
glass. It was still full. 

Jenkins focused his eyes. "Ab!" 
he said. He seemed to cringe in 
his chair. "What you doin' here? 
You look different. All fixed up. 
Find a feller with money?" 

Abbie ignored his questions. "If 
I asked you to do somethin', Paw, 
would you do it?" 

"Sure, Ab," Jenkins said hurriedly. His eyes lit on the bottle 
of bourbon. "Anything." He 
raised the bottle to his lips. It 
gurgled pleasantly and went on 
gurgling. 

Matt watched the level of amber liquid drop in the bottle, but 
when Jenkins put it down and 
wiped his bearded lips with one 
large hairy hand, the bottle was 
half empty and stayed that way. 
Jenkins sighed heavily. 

Matt raised his glass again and 
tilted it to his lips. When he lowered it, the glass was still full 
and Matt was still empty. He 
stared moodily at the glass. 

"If I asked you to hit Mr. 
Wright in the nose," Abbie went 



on, "I reckon you'd do it?" 

Matt tensed himself. 

"Sure, Ab, sure," Jenkins said. 
He turned his massive head slowly. He doubled his fist. The expression behind the beard was 
unreadable, but Matt decided 
that it was better that way. "Ain't 
you been treatin' mah little gal 
right?" Jenkins demanded. "Say, 
son," he said with concern, "you 
don't look so good." He looked 
back at Abbie. "Want I should 
hit him?" 

"Not now," Abbie said. "But 
keep it in mind." 

Matt relaxed and seized the opportunity to dash the glass to his 
mouth. Futilely. Not a drop of 
liquor reached his stomach. Hopelessly, Matt thought of Tantalus. 

"Police!" Jenkins bellowed suddenly, rising up with the neck of 
the bottle in one huge hand. 
Matt looked. The bartender 
was leading three policemen into 
the front of the room. The officers 
advanced stolidly, confident of 
their ultimate strength and authority. Matt turned quickly to 
Abbie. 

"No tricks," he pleaded. "Not 
with the law." 

Abbie yawned. "I'm tired. I 
reckon it's almost midnight." 

Jenkins charged, bull-like, bellowing with rage. And the room 
vanished. 

Matt blinked, sickened. They 
were back in the cabin. Abbie and

he. "What about your father?" 
Matt asked. 

"Next to liquor," Abbie said, 
"Paw likes a fight best. I'm going 
to bed now. I'm real tired." 

She left her shoes on the floor, 
climbed into her bunk, and pulled 
the blanket around herself. 

"1%/f ATT walked slowly to his 
bunk. Mary had a little 
lamb . . . He sat down on it and 
pulled off his shoes, letting them 
thump to the floor . . . with fleece 
as white as snow . . . He pulled 
the blanket around his bunk and 
made rustling sounds, but he 
lay down without removing his 
clothes . . . and everywhere that 
Mary went . . . He lay stiffly, 
listening to the immediate sounds 
of deep breathing coming from 
the other bunk . . . the lamb was 
sure to go . . . 

Two tortured hours crawled by. 
Matt sat up cautiously. He picked 
up his shoes from the floor. He 
straightened up. Slowly he tiptoed toward the door. Inch by 
inch, listening to Abbie's steady 
breathing, until he was at the 
door. He slipped it open, only a 
foot. He squeezed through and 
drew it shut behind him. 

A porch board creaked. Matt 
froze. He waited. There was no 
sound from inside. He crept over 
the pebbles of the driveway, suppressing exclamations of pain. 
But he did not dare stop to put 



on his shoes. 

He was beside the car. He eased 
the door open and slipped into the 
seat. Blessing the steep driveway, 
he released the brake and pushed 
in the clutch. The car began to 
roll. Slowly at first, then picking 
up speed, the car turned out of 
the driveway into the road. 

Ghostlike in the brilliant moon, 
it sped silent down the long hill. 
After one harrowing tree-darkened turn, Matt switched on the 
lights and gently clicked the door 
to its first catch. 

When he was a mile away, he 
started the motor. 

Escape ! 

1%/|ATT pulled up to the gas 
pump in the gray dawn that 
was already sticky with heat. 
Through the dusty, bug-splattered windshield the bloodshot 
sun peered at him and saw a dark 
young man in stained work 
clothes, his face stubbled blackly, 
his eyes burning wearily. But 
Matt breathed deep; he drew in 
the wine of freedom. 

Was this Fair Play or Humansville? Matt was too tired and 
hungry to remember. Whichever 
it was, all was well. 

It seemed a reasonable assumption that Abbie could not find 
him if she did not know where 
he was, that she could not teleport herself anywhere she had not 
already been. When she had dis


54 




 



appeared the first time, she had 
gone to the places in Springfield 
she knew. She had brought her 
father from his two-room shanty. 
She had taken him back to the 
cabin. 

The sleepy attendant approached, and with him came a 
wash of apprehension to knot his 
stomach. Money! He had no 
money. Hopelessly he began to 
search his pockets. Without 
money he was stuck here, and all 
his money was back in his cabin 
with his clothes and his typewriter 
and his manila folder of notes. 

And then his hand touched 
something in his hip pocket. 
Wonderingly, he pulled it out. It 
was his billfold. He peered at its 
contents. Four dollars in bills and 
three hundred in travelers' checks. 
"Fill it up," he said. 

When had he picked up the 
billfold? Or had he had it all 
the time? He could have sworn 
that he had not had it when he 
was in the cocktail lounge in 
Springfield. He was almost sure 
that he had left it in his suit 
pants. The uncertainty made him 
vaguely uneasy. Or was it only 
hunger? He hadn't eaten since 
toying with Abbie's stolen delicacies yesterday afternoon. 

"Where's a good place to eat?" 
he asked, as the attendant handed 
him change. 

It was an old fellow in coveralls. He pointed a few hundred 



feet up the road. "See those 
trucks parked outside that 
diner?" Matt nodded. "Usual 
thing, when you see them outside, you can depend on good 
food inside. Here it don't mean a 
thing. Food's lousy. We got a 
landmark though. Truckers stop 
to see it." The old fellow cackled. 
"Name's Lola." 

As Matt pulled away, the old 
man called after him. "Don't 
make no difference, anyway. No 
place else open." 

Matt parked beside one of the 
large trailer trucks. Lola? He 
made a wry face as he got out 
of the car. He was through with 
women. 

The diner, built in the shape of 
a railroad car, had a long counter 
running along one side, but it was 
filled with truckers in shirt 
sleeves, big men drinking coffee 
and smoking and teasing the 
waitress. Tiredly, Matt slipped 
into one of the empty booths. 

The waitress detached herself 
from her admirers immediately 
and came to the booth with a 
glass of water in one hand, swinging her hips confidently. She had 
a smoldering, dark beauty, and 
she was well aware of it. Her 
black hair was cut short, and her 
brown eyes and tanned face were 
smiling. Her skirt and low-cut 
peasant blouse bulged generously 
in the right places. Some time — 
and not too many years in the 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



55 



future — she would be fat, but 
right now she was lush, ready to 
be picked by the right hand. 
Matt guessed that she would not 
be a waitress in a small town 
long. As she put the water on 
the table, she bent low to demonstrate just how lush she was. 

The neckline drooped. Against 
his will, Matt's eyes drifted toward her. 

"What'll you have?" the waitress said softly. 

Matt swallowed. "A couple of 
— hotcakes," he said, "with sausages." 

She straightened up slowly, 
smiling brightly at him. "Stack a 
pair," she yelled, "with links." 
She turned around and looked 
enticingly over her shoulder. 
"Coffee?" 

Matt nodded. He smiled a 
little to show that he appreciated 
her attentions. There was no 
doubt about the fact that she was 
an attractive girl. In anyone's 
mind. Any other time . . . 

??r\UCH!" she said suddenly 
^-^ and straightened. She began to rub her rounded bottom 
vigorously and cast Matt a hurt, 
reproachful glance. Slowly her 
pained expression changed to a 
roguish smile. She waggled a 
coy finger at Matt. "Naughty, 
naughty!" the finger said. Matt 
stared at her as if she had lost 
her senses. He shook his head in 



bewilderment as she vanished behind the counter. And then he 
noticed that a couple of the 
truckers had turned around to 
glower at him, and Matt became 
absorbed in contemplating the 
glass of water. 

It made him realize how thirsty 
he was. He drank the whole 
glassful, but it didn't seem to 
help much. He was just as thirsty, 
just as empty. 

Lola wasted no time in bringing Matt's cup of coffee. She carried it casually and efficiently in 
one hand, not spilling a drop into 
the saucer. But as she neared 
Matt the inexplicable happened. 
She tripped over something invisible on the smooth floor. She 
stumbled. The coffee flew in a 
steaming arc and splashed on 
Matt's shirt with incredible accuracy, soaking in hotly. 

Lola gasped, her hand to her 
mouth. Matt leaped up, pulling 
his shirt away from his chest, 
swearing. Lola grabbed a handful 
of paper napkins and began to 
dab at his shirt. 

"Golly, honey, I'm sorry," she 
said warmly. "I can't understand 
how I came to trip." 

She pressed herself close to 
him. Matt could smell the odor 
of gardenias. 

"That's all right," he said, 
drawing back. "It was an accident." 

She followed him up, working 



56 




 



at his shirt. Matt noticed that the 
truckers were all watching, some 
darkly, the rest enviously. He 
slipped back into the booth. 

One of the truckers guffawed. 
"You don't have to spill coffee 
on me, Lola, to make me steam," 
he said. The rest of the truckers 
laughed with him. 

"Oh, shut up!" Lola told them. 
She turned back to Matt. "You 
all right, honey?" 

"Sure, sure," Matt said wearily. 
"Just bring me the hotcakes." 
The coffee had cooled now. His 
shirt felt clammy. Matt thought 
about accident prones. It had to 
be an accident. He glanced uneasily around the diner. The only 
girl here was Lola. 

The hotcakes were ready. She 
was bringing them toward the 
booth, but it was not a simple 
process. Matt had never seen slippery hotcakes before this. Lola 
was so busy that she forgot to 
swing her hips. 

The hotcakes slithered from 
side to side on the plate. Lola 
juggled them, tilting the plate 
back and forth to keep them from 
sliding off. Her eyes were wide 
with astonishment; her mouth 
was a round, red "O"; her forehead was furrowed with concentration. She did an intricate, 
unconscious dance step to keep 
from losing the top hotcake. 

As Matt watched, fascinated, 
the sausages, four of them linked 



together, started to slip from the 
plate. With something approaching sentience, they skilled off and 
disappeared down the low neck 
of Lola's blouse. 

Lola shrieked. She started to 
wriggle, her shoulders hunched. 
While she tried to balance the 
hotcakes with one hand, the 
other dived into the blouse and 
hunted around frantically. Matt 
watched; the truckers watched. 
Lola hunted and wiggled. The 
hand that held the plate flew up. 
The hotcakes scattered. 

One hit the nearest trucker in 
the face. He peeled it off, red and 
bellowing. "A joker!" He dived 
off the stool toward Matt. 

It/TATT tried to get up, but the 

-L" table caught him in his 
stomach. He climbed up on the 
seat. The hotcake the trucker had 
discarded had landed on the head 
of the man next to him. He stood 
up angrily. 

Lola had finally located the 
elusive sausages. She drew them 
out of their intimate hiding place 
with a shout of triumph. They 
whipped into the open mouth of 
the lunging trucker. He stopped, 
transfixed, strangling. 

"Argh-gh-uggle!" he said. 

A cup crashed against the wall, 
close to Matt's head. Matt 
ducked. If he could get over the 
back of this booth, he could 
reach the door. The place was 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



57 



filled with angry shouts and 
angrier faces and bulky shoulders approaching. Lola took one 
frightened loolf and grabbed 
Matt around the knees. 

"Protect me!" she said wildly. 

The air was filled with missiles. 
Matt reached down to disengage 
Lola's fear-strengthened arms. He 
glanced up to see the trucker 
spitting out the last of the sausages. With a maddened yell, the 
trucker threw a heavy fist at 
Matt. Hampered as he was, Matt 
threw himself back hopelessly. 
Something ripped. The fist 
breezed past and crashed through 
a window. 

Matt hung over the back of the 
booth, head downward, unable to 
get back up, unable to shake 
Lola loose. Everywhere he looked 
he could see rage-enflamed faces. 
He closed his eyes and surrendered himself to his fate. 

From somewhere, above the 
tumult, came the sound of 
laughter, like the tinkling of little 
silver bells. 

Then Matt was outside with no 
idea of how he had got there. 
In his hand was a strip of thin 
fabric. Lola's blouse. Poor Lola, 
he thought, as he threw it away. 
What was his fatal fascination 
for girls? 

Behind him the diner was alive 
with lights and the crash of 
dishes and the smacking of fists 
on flesh. Before long they would 



discover that he was gone. 

Matt ran to his car. It started 
to life when he punched the button. He backed it up, screeched it 
to a stop, jerked into first, and 
barreled onto the highway. Within twenty seconds, he was doing 
sixty. 

He turned to look back at the 
diner and almost lost control of 
the car as he tried to absorb the 
implications of the contents on 
the back seat. 

Resting neatly there were his 
typewriter, notes, and all his 
clothes. 

WHEN Matt pulled to a stop 
on the streets of Clinton, he 
was feeling easier mentally and 
much worse physically. The dip 
in a secluded stream near the 
road, the change of clothes, and 
the shave — torturing as it had 
been in cold water — had refreshed 
him for a while. But that had 
worn off, and the lack of a 
night's sleep and twenty-four 
hours without food were catching up with him. 

Better that, he thought grimly, 
than Abbie. He could endure 
anything for a time. 

As for the typewriter and the 
notes and the clothes, there was 
probably some simple explanation. The one Matt liked best was 
that Abbie had had a change of 
heart; she had expected him to 
leave and she had made his way 



58 




 



easy. She was, Matt thought, a 
kind-hearted child underneath it 
all. 

The trouble with that explanation was that Matt didn't believe 
it. 

He shrugged. There were more 
pressing things — money, for instance. Gas was getting low, and 
he needed to get something in his 
stomach if he was to keep up 
his strength for the long drive 
ahead. He had to cash one of his 
checks. That seemed simple 
enough. The bank was at the 
corner of this block. It was eleven 
o'clock. The bank would be open. 
Naturally they would cash a 
check. 

But for some reason Matt felt 
uneasy. 

Matt walked into the bank and 
went directly to a window. He 
countersigned one of the checks 
and presented it to the teller, a 
thin little man with a wispy mustache and a bald spot on top of 
his head. The teller compared the 
signatures and turned to the shelf 
at his side where bills stood in 
piles, some still wrapped. He 
counted out four twenties, a ten, a 
five, and five ones. 

"Here you are, sir," he said 
politely. 

Matt accepted it only because 
his hand was outstretched and 
the teller put the money in it. His 
eyes were fixed in horror upon 
a wrapped bundle of twenty dol


lar bills which was slowly rising 
from the shelf. It climbed leisurely over the top of the cage. 

"What's the matter, sir?" the 
teller asked in alarm. "Do you 
feel sick?" 

Matt nodded once and then 
tore his eyes away and shook his 
head vigorously. "No," he gasped. 
"I'm all right." He took a step 
back from the window. 

"Are you sure? You don't look 
well at all." 

WITH a shrinking feeling, 
Matt felt something fumble 
its way into his right hand coat 
pocket. He plunged his hand in 
after it. His empty stomach revolved in his abdomen. He could 
not mistake the touch of crisp 
paper. He stooped quickly beneath the teller's window. The 
teller leaned out. Matt straightened up, the package of bills in 
his hand. 

"I guess you must have 
dropped this," he muttered. 

The teller glanced at the shelf 
and back at the sheaf of twenties. 
"I don't see how — But thank you! 
That's the funniest — " 

Matt pushed the bills under the 
grillwork. "Yes, isn't it," he 
agreed hurriedly. "Well, thank 
you." 

"Thank you!" 

Matt lifted his hand. The 
money lifted with it. The package stuck to his hand as if it 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



59 



had been attached with glue. 

"Excuse me," he said feebly. "I 
can't seem to get rid of this 
money." He shook his hand. The 
money clung stubbornly. He 
shook his hand again, violently. 
The package of bills did not 
budge. 

"Very funny," the teller said, 
but he was not smiling. From 
his tone of voice, Matt suspected 
that he thought money was a 
very serious business indeed. The 
teller reached under the bars and 
caught hold of one end of the 
package. "You can let go now," 
he said. "Let go!" 

Matt tried to pull his hand 
away. "I can't!" he said, breathing heavily. 

The teller tugged, Matt tugged. 
"I haven't time to play games," 
the teller panted. "Let go!" 

"I don't want it," Matt said 
frantically. "But it seems to be 
stuck. Look!" He showed his 
hand, fingers spread wide. 

The teller grabbed the bundle 
of bills with both hands and 
braced his feet against the front 
of his cubicle. "Let go!" he 
shouted. 

Matt pulled hard. Suddenly 
the tension on his arm vanished. 
His arm whipped back. The teller 
disappeared into the bottom of 
the cubicle. Something clanged 
hollowly. Matt looked at his 
hand. The bills were gone. 

Slowly the teller's head ap


peared from the concealed part 
of the cubicle. It came up, accompanied by groans, with a red 
swelling in the middle of the bald 
spot. After it came the teller's 
hand, waving the package of 
twenties triumphantly. The other 
hand was rubbing his head. 

"Are you still here?" he demanded, slamming the bills down 
at his side. "Get out of this bank. 
And if you ever come back I'll 
have you arrested for — for disturbing the peace." 

"Don't worry," Matt said. "I 
won't be back." His face suddenly grew pale. "Stop" he said 
frantically, waving his arms. "Go 
back!" 

The teller stared at him, fearfully, indecisively. 

rpHE bundle of twenties was 
rising over the top of the 
cage again. Instinctively, Matt 
grabbed them out of the air. His 
mind clicked rapidly. If he was 
to keep out of jail, there was only 
one thing to do. He advanced on 
the teller angrily, waving the bills 
in the air. 

"What do you mean by throwing these at me!" 

"Throwing money?" the teller 
said weakly. "Me?" 

Matt shook the bills in front of 
the teller's nose. "What do you 
call this?" 

The clerk glanced at the money 
and down at his side. "Oh, no!" 



60 




 




he moaned. 

"I have a good mind," Matt 
said violently, "to complain to 
the president of this bank." He 
slammed the bills down. He 
closed his eyes in a silent 
prayer "Tellers throwing money 
around!" 

He took his hand away. Blissfully, the money stayed where it 
was on the counter. The teller 
reached for it feebly. The package shifted. He reached again. 
The bills slid away. He stuck both 
hands through the slot and 
groped wildly. The money slipped 
between his arms into the cage. 

Matt stood shifting his weight 
from foot to foot, paralyzed between flight and fascination. The 
bundle winged its way around in 
the cage like a drunken butterfly. 
Wide-eyed and frantic, the teller 
chased it from side to side. He 
made great diving swoops for it, 
his hands cupped into a net. He 
crept up on it and pounced, catlike, only to have to slip between 
his fingers at the last moment. 
Suddenly he stopped, frozen. His 
hands flew to his head. 

"My God!" he screamed. 
"What am I doing? I'm mad!" 

Matt backed toward the door. 
The other clerks and tellers were 
running toward the center of the 
disturbance. Matt saw a dignified 
gentleman with a paunch stand 
up inside a railed-in office and 
hurdle the obstacle with fine 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



61 



show of athletic form. 

Matt turned and ran, dodging 
the guard at the gate. "Get the 
doctor," he yelled. 

From somewhere came the 
sound of a tinkling of little silver 
bells. 

There was no doubt in Matt's 
mind as he gunned his car out 
of Clinton. Abbie was after him. 
He had not been free a moment. 
All the time she had known where 
to find him. He was the fleeing 
mouse, happy in his illusion of 
freedom — until the cat's paw 
comes down on his back. Matt 
thought of the Furies — awful 
Alecto, Tisiphone, Megaera — in 
their blood-stained robes and 
serpent hair pursuing him across 
the world with their terrible 
whips. But they all had Abbie's 
face. 

Matt drove north toward Kansas City, thirsty, starving, half 
dead from fatigue, wondering 
hopelessly where it would end. 

rvARKENING shades of violet 
U were creeping up the eastern 
sky as Matt reached Lawrence, 
Kansas. He had not tried to stop 
in Kansas City. Something had 
drawn him on, some buried hope 
that still survived feebly, and 
when, five miles from Lawrence, 
he had seen Mount Oread rise 
against the sunset, the white 
spires and red tile roofs of the 
university gleaming like beacons, 



he had known what it was. 

Here was a citadel of knowledge, a fortress of the world's 
truth against black waves of ignorance and superstition. Here, in 
this saner atmosphere of study 
and reflection, logic and cool 
consideration, here, if anywhere, 
he could shake off this dark conviction of doom that sapped his 
will. Here, surely, he could think 
more clearly, act more decisively, 
rid himself of this demon of 
vengeance that rode his shoulders. 
Here he could get help. 

He drove down Massachusetts 
Street, his body leaden with fatigue, his eyes red-rimmed and 
shadowed searching restlessly 
from side to side. His hunger was 
only a dull ache; he could almost 
forget it. But his thirst was a live 
thing. Somewhere — he could not 
remember where — he had eaten 
and drunk, but they had vanished 
from his throat as he swallowed. 

Is there no end? he thought 
wildly. Is there no way out? 
There was, of course. There always is. Always — Mary had a 
little lamb . . . 

Impulse swung his car into the 
diagonal parking space. First he 
was going to drink and eat, 
come what may. He walked into 
the restaurant. Summer students 
filled the room, young men in 
sport shirts and slacks, girls in 
gay cotton prints and saddle 
shoes, laughing, talking, eating . . . 



62 




 



Swaying in the doorway, Matt 
watched them, bleary-eyed. Once 
I was like them, he thought dully. 
Young and alive and conscious 
that these were the best years I 
would ever know. Now I am old 
and used up, doomed . . . 

He slumped down at a table 
near the front, filled with a great 
surge of sorrow that all happiness 
was behind him. He was conscious that the waitress was beside him. "Soup," he mumbled. 
"Soup and milk." He did not look 
up. 

"Yes, sir," she said. Her voice 
sounded vaguely familiar, but 
they are all the same, all the 
voices of youth. He had eaten 
here before. He did not look up. 

Slowly he raised the glass of 
water to his lips. It went down his 
throat in dusty gulps. It spread 
out in his stomach in cool, blessed 
waves. Matt closed his eyes 
thankfully. The hunger pains began to return. For a moment 
Matt regretted the soup and 
wished he had ordered steak. 

After the soup, he thought. 

The soup came. Matt lifted a 
spoonful. He let it trickle down 
his throat. 

"Feelin' better, Mr. Wright," 
said the waitress. 

Tt/fATT looked up. He strangled. 
-L" It was Abbie! Abbie's face 
bending over him. Matt choked 
and spluttered. Students turned 



to stare. Matt gazed around the 
room wildly. The girls — they all 
looked like Abbie. He stood up, 
almost knocking over the table 
as he ran to the front door. 

With his hand on the door 
knob, he stopped, paralyzed. 
Staring in at him, through the 
glass, was a pair of bloodshot 
eyes set above an unruly black 
nest. Stooped, powerful shoulders 
loomed behind the face. As Matt 
stared back, the eyes lighted up 
as if they recognized him. 

"Argh-gh!" Matt screamed. 

He staggered back and turned 
on trembling legs. He tottered 
toward the back of the restaurant. The aisle seemed full of feet 
put out to trip him. He stumbled 
to the swinging kitchen door and 
broke through into odors of frying and baking that no longer 
moved him. 

The cook looked up, startled. 
Matt ran on through the kitchen 
and plunged through the back 
door. The alley was dark. Matt 
barked his shins on a box. He 
limped on, cursing. At one end of 
the alley a street light spread a 
pool of welcome. Matt ran toward 
it. He was panting. His heart beat 
fast. Then it almost stopped. A 
shadow lay along the mouth of 
the alley. A long shadow with 
huge shoulders and something 
that waved from the chin. 

Matt spun. He ran frantically 
toward the other end of the alley. 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



63 



His mind raced like an engine 
that has broken its governor. 
Nightmarish terror streaked 
through his arms and legs; they 
seemed distant and leaden. But 
slowly he approached the other 
end. He came nearer. Nearer. 

A shadow detached itself from 
the dark back walls. But it was 
no shadow. Matt slowed, stopped. 
The shadow came closer, towering tall above him. Matt cowered, 
unable to move. Closer. Two long 
arms reached out toward him. 
Matt quivered. He waited for the 
end. The arms wrapped around 
him. They drew him close. 

"Son, son," Jenkins said weakly. "Yore the first familiar face 
I seen all day." 

Matt's heart started beating 
again. He drew back, extracting 
his face from Jenkin's redolent 
beard. 

"Cain't understand what's goin' on these days," Jenkins said 
shaking his head sadly, "but I 
got a feelin' Ab's behint it. Just 
as that fight got goin' good, the 
whole shebang disappeared and 
here I was. Where am I, son?" 

"Kansas," Matt said. "Lawrence, Kansas." 

"Kansas?" Jenkins wobbled his 
beard. "Last I heard, Kansas was 
dry, but it can't be half as dry 
as I am. I recollect hearin' Quantrell burned this town. Too bad it 
didn't stay burned. Here I was 
without a penny in my pocket 



and only what was left in the 
bottle I had in my hand to keep 
me from dyin' of thirst. Son," he 
said sorrowfully, "somethin's got 
to be done. It's Ab, ain't it?" 
Matt nodded. 

"Son," Jenkins went on, "I'm 
gettin' too old for this kind of 
life. I should be sittin' on my 
porch with a jug in my lap, just 
a-rockin' slow. Somethin's got to 
be done about that gal." 

"I'm afraid it's too late for 
that," Matt said. 

"That's the trouble," Jenkins 
said mournfully. "Been too late 
for these six years. Son, yore an 
edyicated inan. What we gonna 
do?" 

"I can't tell you, Jenkins," 
Matt said. "I can't even think 
about it." Mary had a little lamb 
. . . "If I did, it wouldn't work. 
But if you want to hit me, go 
ahead. I'm the man who's responsible." 

Jenkins put a large hand on his 
shoulder. "Don't worry about it, 
son. If it weren't you, it would've 
been some other man. When Ab 
gets a notion, you cain't beat it 
out of her. I learned that years 
ago." 

Matt pulled out his billfold and 
handed Jenkins a five dollar bill. 
"Here. Kansas isn't dry any more. 
Go get something and try to forget. Maybe when you're finished 
with that, things will have 
changed." 



64 




 



"Yore a good boy, son. Don't 
do nothin' rash." 

Mary had a little lamb . . . 

JENKINS turned, raising his 
hand in a parting salute. Matt 
watched the mountainous shadow 
dwindle, as if it was his last contact with the living. Then Jenkins rounded the corner and was 
out of sight. 

Matt walked slowly back to 
Massachusetts Street. There was 
one more thing he had to do. 

As he reached the car, Matt 
sensed Abbie's nearness. The 
awareness was so sharp that it 
was almost physical. He felt her 
all around, like dancing motes of 
dust that are only visible under 
certain conditions, half angel, half 
devil, half love, half hate. It was 
an unendurable mixture, an impossible combination to live with. 
The extremes were too great. 

Matt sighed. It was not Abbie's 
fault. If it was anyone's fault, 
it was his. "Inevitably, he would 
pay for it. The Universe has an 
immutable law of action and reaction. 

It was dark as Matt drove 
along Seventh Street. The night 
was warm, and the infrequent 
street lights were only beacons 
for nightflying insects. Matt 
turned a corner and pulled up in 
front of a big old house surrounded by an ornamental iron 
fence. The house was a two


story stucco, painted yellow — or 
perhaps it had once been white — 
and the fence sagged in places. 

Most of the houses in Lawrence 
are old. The finest and the newest are in the west, on the ridge 
overlooking the Wakarusa Valley, 
but university professors cannot 
afford such sites or such houses. 

Matt rang the bell. In a moment the door opened. Blinking 
out of the light was Professor 
Franklin, his faculty adviser. 

"Matt!" Franklin said. "I didn't 
recognize you for a second. What 
are you doing back so soon? I 
thought you were secluded in the 
Ozarks. Don't tell me you have 
your thesis finished already?" 

"No, Dr. Franklin," Matt said 
wearily, "but I'd like to talk to 
you for a moment if you can 
spare the time." 

"Come in, come in. I'm just 
grading some papers." Franklin 
grimaced. "Freshman papers." 

Franklin led the way into his 
book-cluttered study off the living 
room. His glasses were resting on 
top of a pile of papers. He picked 
them up, slipped them on, and 
turned to Matt. He was a tall 
man, a little stooped now in his 
sixties, with gray, unruly hair. 

"Matt!" he exclaimed. "You 
aren't looking well. Have you 
been sick?" 

"In a way," Matt said, "you 
might call it that. How would 
you treat someone who believes 



WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



65 



in the reality of psychic phenomena?" 

Franklin shrugged. "Lots of 
people believe in it and are still 
worthwhile, reliable members of 
society. Conan Doyle, for instance — " 

"And could prove it," Matt 
added. 

"Hallucinations? Then it becomes more serious. I suppose 
psychiatric treatment would be 
necessary. Remember, Matt, I'm 
a teacher, not a practitioner. But 
look here, you aren't suggesting 
that—?" 

Matt nodded. "I can prove it, 
and I don't want to. Would it 
make the world any better, any 
happier?" 

"The truth is always important 
— for itself if for nothing else. 
But you can't be serious — " 

"Dead serious." Matt shivered. 
"Suppose I could prove that there 
were actually such things as levitation, teleportation, telepathy. 
There isn't any treatment, is 
there, Professor, when a man goes 
sane?" 

"Matt! You are sick, aren't 
you?" 

"Suppose," Matt went on relentlessly, "that your glasses 
should float over and come to 
rest on my nose. What would you 
say then?" 

"I'd say you need to see a 
psychiatrist," Franklin said worriedly. "You do, Matt." 



TTIS glasses gently detached 
themselves and floated leisurely through the air and adjusted themselves on Matt's face. 
Franklin stared blindly. 

"Matt!" he exclaimed, groping. 
"That isn't very funny." 

Matt sighed and handed the 
glasses back. Franklin put them 
back on, frowning. 

"Suppose," Matt said, "I 
should float in the air?" As he 
spoke, he felt himself lifting. 

Franklin looked up. "Come 
down here!" 

Matt came back into his chair. 

"These tricks," Franklin said 
sternly, "aren't very seemly. Go 
to a doctor, Matt. Don't waste 
any time. And," he added, taking 
off his glasses and polishing them 
vigorously, "I think I'll see my 
oculist in the morning." 

Matt sighed again. "I was 
afraid that was the way it would 
be. Abbie?" 

Franklin stared. 

"Yes, Mr. Wright." The words, 
soft and gentle, came out of midair. 

Franklin's eyes searched the 
room frantically. 

"Thanks," Matt said. 

"Leave this house!" Franklin 
said, his voice trembling. "I've 
had enough of these pranks!" 

Matt got up and went to the 
front door. "I'm afraid Dr. 
Franklin doesn't believe in you. 
But I do. Good-by, Dr. Franklin. 



66 




 



I don't think a doctor would cure 
what I've got." 

When he left, Franklin was 
searching the living room. 

rpHERE was something strangely final about the drive 
through the campus. Along 
Oread street on top of Mount 
Oread, overlooking the Kaw Valley on the north and the Wakarusa on the south, the university buildings stood dark and 
deserted. Only the Student Union 
was lighted and the library and 
an occasional bulletin board. The 
long arms of the administration 
building were gloomy, and the 
night surrounded the white arches 
of Hoch Auditorium . . . 

He pulled into the parking area 
behind the apartment building 
and got out and walked slowly 
to the entrance. He hoped that 
Guy wouldn't be in. 

Matt opened the door. The 
apartment was empty. He turned 
on a living rpom lamp. The room 
was in typical disarray. A sweater 
on the davenport, books in the 
chair. 

In the dark, Matt went to the 
kitchen. He bumped into the 
stove and swore, and rubbed his 
hip. Mary had a little lafhb . . . 
Somewhere around here . . . 

Some hidden strength kept 
Matt from dropping in his tracks. 
He should have collapsed from 
exhaustion and hunger long ago. 

WHEREVER YOU MAY BE 



But soon there would be time to 
rest . . . and everywhere that 
Mary went . . . He stooped. There 
it was. The sugar. The sugar. He 
had always liked blue sugar. 

He found a package of cereal 
and got the milk from the refrigerator. He found a sharp knife 
in the drawer and sliced the box 
in two. He dumped the contents 
into a bowl and poured the milk 
over it and sprinkled the sugar 
on top. The blue sugar . . . with 
fleece as white as snow . . . He 
was very sleepy. 

He lifted a spoonful of the 
cereal to his mouth. He chewed 
it for a moment. He swallowed . . . 

And it was gone. 

He grabbed the knife and 
plunged it toward his chest. 

And his hand was empty. 

He was very sleepy. His head 
drooped. Suddenly it straightened 
up. The hissing had stopped. A 
long time ago. He turned on the 
light and saw that the burner was 
turned off, the one that never 
lighted from the pilot, the one he 
had stumbled against. 

The blue insect poison had 
failed and the knife and the gas. 

He felt a great wave of despair. 
It was no use. There was no way 
out. 

TTE walked back to the living 
room, brushed the sweater off 
the davenport, and sat down. The 
last hope — beyond which there is 

67 



no hope — was gone. And yet, in a 
way, he was glad that his tricks 
had not worked. Not that he was 
still alive but because it had been 
the coward's way. All along he 
had been trying to dodge the only 
solution that faced him at every 
turn. He had refused to recognize 
it, but now there was no other 
choice. 

It was the hard way, the bitter 
way. The way that was not a 
quick death but a slow one. But 
he owed it to the world to sacrifice himself on the altar he 
had raised, under the knife he had 
honed, wielded by the arm that 
he had given strength and skill 
and* consciousness . 

He looked up. "All right, Abbie," he sighed. "I'll marry you." 

The words hung in the air. 
Matt waited, filled with a fear 
that was half hope. 

Was it too late for anything but 
vengeance? 

But Abbie filled his arms, cuddled against him in homely blue 
gingham, scarcely bigger than a 
child but with the warmth and 
softness of a woman. She was 
more beautiful than Matt had remembered. Her arms crept 
around his neck. 

"Will you, Mr. Wright?" she 
whispered. "Will you?" 

A vision built itself up in his 
mind. The omniscient, omnipotent wife, fearsome when her powers were sheathed, terrible in 

68 



anger or disappointment. No man, 
he thought, was ever called upon 
for greater sacrifice. But he was 
the appointed lamb. 

He sighed. "God help me," he 
said, "I will." 

He kissed her. Her lips were 
sweet and passionate. 

MATTHEW Wright was lucky, 
of course, far luckier than he 
deserved to be, than any man 
deserves to be.

t; 



HE photon storm struck 
without warning, pouncing 
upon the Ship from behind 
a bank of giant red stars. Eye 
barely had time to flash a last 
second warning through Talker 
before it was upon them. 

It was Talker's third journey 
into deep space, and his first 
light-pressure storm. He felt a 
sudden pang of fear as the Ship 
yawed violently, caught the force 
of the wave-front and careened 
. end for end. Then the fear was 
gone, replaced by a strong pulse 
, ' ; of excitement.

asked himself — hadn't he been

trained for just this sort of emergency? 

He had been talking to Feeder 
when the storm hit, but he cut 
off the conversation abruptly. He 
hoped Feeder would be all right. 
It was the youngster's first deep 
space trip. 

The wirelike filaments that 
made up most of Talker's body 
were extended throughout the 
Ship. Quickly he withdrew all 
except the ones linking him to 
Eye, Engine, and the Walls. This 
was strictly their job now. The 
rest of the Crew would have to 
shift for themselves until the 
storm was over. 

Eye had flattened his disklike 
body against a Wall, and had 
one seeing organ extended outside the Ship. For greater concentration, the rest of his seeing 
organs were collapsed, clustered 
against his body. 

Through Eye's seeing organ, 
Talker watched the storm. He 
translated Eye's purely visual 
image into a direction for Engine, 
who shoved the Ship around to 
meet the waves. At appreciably 
the same time, Talker translated 
direction into velocity for the 
Walls, who stiffened to meet the 
shocks. 

The coordination was swift 
and sure — Eye measuring the 
waves, Talker relaying the messages to Engine and Walls, Engine driving the ship nose-first 



into the waves, and Walls bracing to meet the shock. 

Talker forgot any fear he 
might have had in the swiftly 
functioning teamwork. He had 
no time to think. As the Ship's 
communication system, he had to 
translate- and flash his messages 
at top speed, coordinating information and directing action. 

In a matter of minutes, the 
storm was over. 

"ALL right," Talker said. 

Let's see if there was any 
damage." His filaments had become tangled during the storm, 
but he untwisted and extended 
them through the Ship, plugging 
everyone into circuit. "Engine?" 

"I'm fine," Engine said. The 
tremendous old fellow had dampened his plates during the storm, 
easing down the atomic explosions in his stomach. No storm 
could catch an experienced spacer like Engine unaware. 

"Walls?" 

The Walls reported one by 
one, and this took a long time. 
There were almost a thousand 
of them, thin, rectangular fellows 
making up the entire skin of the 
Ship. Naturally, they had reinforced their edges during the 
storm, giving the whole Ship resiliency. But one or two were 
dented badly. 

Doctor announced that he was 
all right. He removed Talker's 



70 




 



filament from his head, taking 
himself out of circuit, and went 
to work on the dented Walls. 
Made mostly of hands, Doctor 
had clung to an Accumulator 
during the storm. 

"Let's go a little faster now," 
Talker said, remembering that 
there still was the problem of 
determining where they were. He 
opened the circuit to the four 
Accumulators. "How are you?" 
he asked. 

There was no answer. The Accumulators were asleep. They 
had had their receptors open 
during the storm and were bloated on energy. Talker twitched 
his filaments around them, but 
they didn't stir. 

"Let me," Feeder said. Feeder 
had taken quite a beating before 
planting his suction cups to a 
Wall, but his cockiness was intact. He was the only member 
of the Crew who never needed 
Doctor's attention; his body was 
quite capable of repairing itself. 

He scuttled across the floor on 
a dozen or so tentacles, and 
booted the nearest Accumulator. 
The big, conial storage unit 
opened one eye, then closed it 
again. Feeder kicked him again, 
getting no response. He reached 
for the Accumulator's safety 
valve and drained off some energy. 

"Stop that," the Accumulator 
said. 



"Then wake up and report," 
Talker told him. 

The Accumulators said testily 
that they were all right, as any 
fool could see. They had been 
anchored to the floor during the 
storm. 

'T'HE rest of the inspection went 
-"- quickly. Thinker was fine, 
and Eye was ecstatic over the 
beauty of the storm. There was 
only one casualty. 

Pusher was dead. Bipedal, he 
didn't have the stability of the 
rest of the Crew. The storm had 
caught him in the middle of a 
floor, thrown him against a stiffened Wall, and broken several 
of his important bones. He was 
beyond Doctor's skill to repair. 

They were silent for a while. 
It was always serious when a 
part of the Ship died. The Ship 
was a cooperative unit, composed entirely of the Crew. The 
loss of any member was a blow 
to all the rest. 

It was especially serious now. 
They had just delivered a cargo 
to a port several thousand lightyears from Galactic Center. 
There was no telling where they 
might be. 

Eye crawled to a Wall and extended a seeing organ outside. 
The Walls let it through, then 
sealed around it. Eye's organ 
pushed out, far enough from the 
Ship so he could view the entire 



SPECIALIST

sphere of stars. The picture traveled through Talker, who gave 
it to Thinker. 

Thinker lay in one corner of 
the room, a great shapeless blob 
of protoplasm. Within him were 
all the memories of his space going ancestors. He considered 
the picture, compared it rapidly 
with others stored in his cells, 
and said, "No galactic planets 
within reach." 

Talker automatically translated for everyone. It was what 
they had feared. 

Eye, with Thinker's help, calculated that they were several 
hundred light-years off their 
course, on the galactic periphery. 

Every Crew member knew 
what that meant. Without a 
Pusher to boost the Ship to a 
multiple of the speed of light, 
they would never get home. The 
trip back, without a Pusher, 
would take longer than most of 
their lifetimes. 

"What would you suggest?" 
Talker asked Thinker. 

This was too vague a question 
for the literal-minded Thinker. 
He asked to have it rephrased. 

"What would be our best line 
of action," Talker asked, "to get 
back to a galactic planet?" 

Thinker needed several minutes to go through all the possibilities stored in his cells. In the 
meantime, Doctor had patched 
the Walls and was asking to be 



given something to eat. 

"In a little while we'll all eat," 
Talker said, twitching his tendrils nervously. Even though he 
was the second youngest Crew 
member — only Feeder was 
younger — the responsibility was 
largely on him. This was still an 
emergency; he had to coordinate 
information and direct action. 

ONE of the Falls suggested 
that they get good and 
drunk. This unrealistic solution 
was vetoed at once. It was typical of the Walls' attitude, however. They were fine workers and 
good shipmates, but happy-golucky fellows at best. When they 
returned to their home planets, 
they would probably blow all 
their wages on a spree. 

"Loss of Ship's Pusher cripples 
the Ship for sustained fasterthan-light speeds," Thinker began without preamble. "The 
nearest galactic planet is four 
hundred and five light-years off." 

Talker translated all this instantly along his wave-packet 
body. 

"Two courses of action are 
open. First, the Ship can proceed 
to the nearest galactic planet under atomic power from Engine. 
This will take approximately 
two hundred years. Engine might 
still be alive at this time, although no one else will. 

"Second, locate a primitive 



72 




 



planet in this region, upon which 
are latent Pushers. Find one and 
train him. Have him push the 
Ship back to galactic territory." 

Thinker was silent, having 
given all the possibilities he could 
find in the memories of his ancestors. 

They held a quick vote and 
decided upon Thinker's second 
alternative. There was no choice, 
really. It was the only one which 
offered them any hope of getting 
back to their homes. 

"All right," Talker said. "Let's 
eat. I think we all deserve it." 

The body of the dead Pusher 
was shoved into the mouth of 
Engine, who consumed it at once, 
breaking down the atoms to energy. Engine was the only member of the Crew who lived on 
atomic energy. 

For the rest, Feeder dashed up 
and loaded himself from the 
nearest Accumulator. Then he 
transformed the food within him 
into the substances each member 
ate. His body chemistry changed, 
altered, adapted, making the different foods for the Crew. 

Eye lived entirely on a complex chlorophyl chain. Feeder 
reproduced this for him, then 
went over to give Talker his 
hydrocarbons, and the Walls 
their chlorine compound. For 
Doctor he made a facsimile of a 
silicate fruit that grew on Doctor's native planet. 



FINALLY, feeding was over 
and the Ship back in order. 
The Accumulators were stacked 
in a corner, blissfully sleeping 
again. Eye was extending his 
vision as far as he could, shaping 
his main seeing organ for highpowered telescopic reception. 
Even in this emergency, Eye 
couldn't resist making verses. He 
announced that he was at work 
on a new narrative poem, called 
Peripheral Glow. No one wanted 
to hear it, so Eye fed it to Thinker, who stored everything, good 
or bad, right or wrong. 

Engine never slept. Filled to 
the brim on Pusher, he shoved 
the Ship along at several times 
the speed of light. 

The Walls were arguing among 
themselves about who had been 
the drunkest during their last 
leave. 

Talker decided to make himself comfortable. He released his 
hold on the Walls and swung in 
the air, his small round body 
suspended by his crisscrossed 
network of filaments. 

He thought briefly about 
Pusher. It was strange. Pusher 
had been everyone's friend and 
now he was forgotten. That 
wasn't because of indifference; it 
was because the Ship was a unit. 
The loss of a member was regretted, but the important thing 
was for the unit to go on. 

The Ship raced through the 



SPECIALIST 



73 



suns of the periphery. 

Thinker laid out a search 
spiral, calculating their odds on 
finding a Pusher planet at roughly four to one. In a week they 
found a planet of primitive 
Walls. Dropping low, they could 
see the leathery, rectangular fellows basking in the sun, crawling 
over rocks, stretching themselves 
thin in order to float in the 
breeze. 

All the Ship's Walls heaved a 
sigh of nostalgia. It was just like 
home. 

These Walls on the planet 
hadn't been contacted by a galactic team yet, and were still unaware of their great destiny — to 
join in the vast Cooperation of 
the Galaxy. 

There were plenty of dead 
worlds in the spiral, and worlds 
too young to bear life. They 
found a planet of Talkers. The 
Talkers had extended their spidery communication lines across 
half a continent. 

Talker looked at them eagerly, 
through Eye. A wave of self-pity 
washed over him. He remembered home, his family, his 
friends. He thought of the tree 
he was planning to buy when he 
got back. 

For a moment, Talker wondered what he was doing here, 
part of a Ship in a far corner of 
the Galaxy. 

He shrugged off the mood. 



They were bound to find a Pusher planet, if they looked long 
enough. 

At least, he hoped so. 

THERE was a long stretch of 
arid worlds as the Ship pushed through the unexplored periphery. Then a planetful of 
primeval Engines, swimming in a 
radioactive ocean. 

"This is rich territory," Feeder 
said to Talker. "Galactic should 
send a Contact party here." 

"They probably will, after we 
get back," Talker said. 

They were good friends, above 
and beyond the all-enveloping 
friendship of the Crew. It wasn't 
only because they were the 
youngest Crew members, although that had something to do 
with it. They both had the same 
kind of functions and that made 
for a certain rapport. Talker 
translated languages ; Feeder 
transformed foods. Also, they 
looked somewhat alike. Talker 
was a central core with radiating 
filaments; Feeder was a central 
core with radiating tentacles. 

Talker thought that Feeder 
was the next most aware being 
on the Ship. He was never really 
able to understand how some of 
the others carried on the processes of consciousness. 

More suns, more planets. Engine started to overheat. Usually, 
Engine was used only for taking 



74 




 



off and landing, and for fine 
maneuvering in a planetary 
group. Now he had been running 
continuously for weeks, both 
over and under the speed of light. 
The strain was telling on him. 

Feeder, with Doctor's help, rigged a cooling system for him. It 
was crude, but it had to suffice. 
Feeder rearranged nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen atoms to make 
a coolant for the system. Doctor 
diagnosed a long rest for Engine. 
He said that the gallant old fellow couldn't stand the strain for 
more than a week. 

The search continued, with the 
Crew's spirits gradually dropping. They all realized that 
Pushers were rather rare in the 
Galaxy, as compared to the fertile Walls and Engines. 

The Walls were getting pockmarked from interstellar dust. 
They complained that they would 
need a full beauty treatment 
when they got home. Talker assured them that the -company 
would pay for it. 

Even Eye was getting bloodshot from staring into space so 
continuously. 

They dipped over another 
planet. Its characteristics were 
flashed to Thinker, who mulled 
over them. 

Closer, and they could make 
out the forms. 

Pushers! Primitive Pushers! 

They zoomed back into space 



to make plans. Feeder produced 
twenty -three different kinds of 
intoxicants for a celebration. 

The Ship wasn't fit to function 
for three days. 

EVERYONE ready now?" 
Talker asked, a bit fuzzily. 
He had a hangover that burned 
all along his nerve ends. What a 
drunk he had thrown! He had a 
vague recollection of embracing 
Engine, inviting him to share his 
tree when they got back home. 
He shuddered at the idea. 
The rest of the Crew were 
pretty shaky, too. The Walls 
were letting air leak into space; 
they were just too wobbly to seal 
their edges properly. Doctor had 
passed out. 

But the worst off was Feeder. 
Since his system could adapt to 
any type of fuel except atomic, 
he had been sampling every 
batch he made, whether it was 
an unbalanced iodine, pure oxygen or a supercharged ester. He 
was really miserable. His tentacles, usually a healthy aqua, 
were shot through with orange 
streaks. His system was working 
furiously, purging itself of everything, and Feeder was suffering 
the effects of the purge. 

The only sober ones were 
Thinker and Engine. Thinker 
didn't drink,, which was unusual 
for a spacer, though typical of 
Thinker, and Engine couldn't. 



SPECIALIST

They listened while Thinker 
reeled off some astounding facts. 
From Eye's pictures of the planet's surface, Thinker had detected the presence of metallic 
construction. He put forth the 
alarming suggestion that these 
Pushers had constructed a mechanical civilization. 

"That's impossible," three of 
the Walls said flatly, and most 
of the Crew were inclined to 
agree with them. All the metal 
they had ever seen had been 
buried in the ground or lying 
around in worthless oxidized 
chunks. 

"Do you mean that they make 
things out of metal?" Talker demanded. "Out of just plain dead 
metal? What could they make?" 

"They couldn't make anything," Feeder said positively. 
"It would break down constantly. I mean metal doesn't know 
when it's weakening." 

But it seemed to be true. Eye 
magnified his" pictures, and everyone could see that the Pushers 
had made vast shelters, vehicles, 
and other articles from inanimate 
material. 

The reason for this was not 
readily apparent, but it wasn't a 
good sign. However, the really 
hard part was over. The Pusher 
planet had been found. All that 
remained was the relatively easy 
job of convincing a native Pusher, which shouldn't be too hard. 



Talker knew that cooperation 
was the keystone of the Galaxy, 
even among primitive peoples. 

The Crew decided not to land 
in a populated region. Of course, 
there was no reason not to expect a friendly greeting, but it 
was the job of a Contact Team 
to get in touch with them as a 
race. All they wanted was an 
individual. 

Accordingly, they picked out 
a sparsely populated land-mass, 
drifting in while that side of the 
planet was dark. 

They were able to locate a 
solitary Pusher almost at once. 

EYE adapted his vision to see 
in the dark, and they followed the Pusher's movements. 
He lay down, after a while, beside a small, fire. Thinker told 
them that this was a well-known 
resting habit of Pushers. 

Just before dawn, the Walls 
opened, and Feeder, Talker and 
Doctor came out. 

Feeder dashed forward and 
tapped the creature on the shoulder. Talker followed with a communication tendril. 

The Pusher opened his seeing . 
organs, blinked them, and made 
a movement with his eating organ. Then he leaped to his feet 
and started to run. 

The three Crew members were 
astounded. The Pusher hadn't 
even waited to find out what 



76 




 



the three of them wanted! 

Talker extended a filament 
rapidly, and caught the Pusher, 
fifty feet away, by a limb. The 
Pusher fell. 

"Treat him gently," Feeder 
said. "He might be startled by 
our appearance." He twitched his 
tendrils at the idea of a Pusher — 
one of the strangest sights in the 
Galaxy, with his multiple organs 
— being startled at someone else's 
appearance. 

Feeder and Doctor scurried to 
the fallen Pusher, picked him up 
and carried him back to the 
Ship. 

The Walls sealed again. They 
released the Pusher and prepared 
to talk. 

As soon as he was free, the 
Pusher sprang to his limbs and 
ran at the place where the Walls 
had sealed. He pounded against 
them frantically, his eating organ 
open and vibrating. 

"Stop that," the Wall said. He 
bulged, and the Pusher tumbled 
to the floor. Instantly, he jumped 
up and started to run forward. 

"Stop him," Talker said. "He 
might hurt himself." 

One of the Accumulators woke 
up enough to roll into the Pusher's path. The Pusher fell, got 
up again, and ran on. 

Talker had his filaments in the 
front of the Ship also, and he 
caught the Pusher in the bow. 
The Pusher started to tear at his 



tendrils, and Talker let go 
hastily. 

"Plug him into the communication system!" Feeder shouted. 
"Maybe we can reason with 
him!" 

Talker advanced a filament 
toward the Pusher's head, waving it in the universal sign of 
communication. But the Pusher 
continued his amazing behavior, 
jumping out of the way. He had 
a piece of metal in his hand and 
he was waving it frantically. 

"What do you think he's going 
to do with that?" Feeder asked. 
The Pusher started to attack the 
side of the Ship, pounding at 
one of the Walls. The Wall stiffened instinctively and the metal 
snapped. 

"Leave him alone," Talker 
said. "Give him a chance to 
calm down." 

rpALKER consulted with 
Thinker, but they couldn't 
decide what to do about the 
Pusher. He wouldn't accept communication. Every time Talker 
extended a filament, the Pusher 
showed all the signs of violent 
panic. Temporarily, it was an 
impasse. 

Thinker vetoed the plan of 
finding another Pusher on the 
planet. He considered this Pusher's behavior typical; nothing 
would be gained by approaching 
another. Also, a planet was sup


SPECI ALIST 



77 



posed to be contacted only by a 
Contact Team. 

If they couldn't communicate 
with this Pusher, they never 
would with another on the 
planet. 

"I think I know what the 
trouble is," Eye said. He crawled 
up on an Accumulator. "These 
Pushers have evolved a mechanical civilization. Consider for a 
minute how they went about it. 
They developed the use of their 
fingers, like Doctor, to shape 
metal. They utilized their seeing 
organs, like myself. And probably countless other organs." He 
paused for effect. 

"These Pushers have become 
unspecialized!" 

They argued over it for 
several hours. The Walls maintained that no intelligent creature could be unspecialized. It 
was unknown in the Galaxy. But 
the evidence was before them — 
The Pusher cities, their vehicles 
. . . This Pusher, exemplifying 
the rest, seemed capable of a 
multitude of things. 

He was able to do everything 
except Push! 

Thinker supplied a partial explanation. "This is not a primitive planet. It is relatively old 
and should have been in the Cooperation thousands of years 
ago. Since it was not, the Pushers 
upon it were robbed of their 
birthright. Their ability, their 



specialty, was to Push, but there 
was nothing to Push. Naturally, 
they have developed a deviant 
culture. 

"Exactly what this culture is, 
we can only guess. But on the 
basis of the evidence, there is 
reason to believe that these 
Pushers are — uncooperative." 

Thinker had a habit of uttering the most shattering statement 
in the quietest possible way. 

"It is entirely possible," 
Thinker went on inexorably, 
"that these Pushers will have 
nothing to do with us. In which 
case, our chances are approximately 283 to one against finding 
another Pusher planet." 

"We can't be sure he won't 
cooperate," Talker said, "until 
we get him into communication." 
He found it almost impossible to 
believe that any intelligent creature would refuse to cooperate 
willingly. 

"But how?" Feeder asked. 
They decided upon a course of 
action. Doctor walked slowly up 
to the Pusher, who backed away 
from him. In the meantime, 
Talker extended a filament outside the Ship, around, and in 
again, behind the Pusher. 

The Pusher backed against a 
Wall — and Talker shoved the 
filament through the Pusher's 
head, into the communication 
socket in the center of his brain. 

The Pusher collapsed. 



78 




 



WHEN he came to, Feeder 
and Doctor had to hold the 
Pusher's limbs, or he would have 
ripped out the communication 
line. Talker exercised his skill in 
learning the Pusher's language. 

It wasn't too hard. All Pusher 
languages were of the same family, and this was no exception. 
Talker was able to catch enough 
surface thoughts to form a pattern. 

He tried to communicate with 
the Pusher. 

The Pusher was silent. 

"I think he needs food," Feeder said. They remembered that 
it had been almost two days 
since they had taken the Pusher 
on board. Feeder worked up 
some standard Pusher food and 
offered it. 

"My God! A steak!" the Pusher said. 

The Crew cheered along Talker's communication circuits. The 
Pusher had said his first words! 

Talker examined the words 
and searched his memory. He 
knew about two hundred Pusher 
languages and many more simple 
variations. He found that this 
Pusher was speaking a cross of 
two Pusher tongues. 

After the Pusher had eaten, he 
looked around. Talker caught 
his thoughts and broadcast them 
to the Crew. 

The Pusher had a queer way 
of looking at the Ship. He saw 



it as a riot of colors. The walls 
undulated. In front of him was 
something resembling a gigantic 
spider, colored black and green, 
with his web running all over the 
Ship and into the heads of all the 
creatures. He saw Eye as a 
strange, naked little animal, 
something between a skinned 
rabbit and an egg yolk — whatever those things were. 

Talker was fascinated by the 
new perspective the Pusher's 
mind gave him. He had never 
seen things that way before. But 
now that the Pusher was pointing it out, Eye was a pretty 
funny-looking creature. 

They settled down to communication. 

"What in hell are you things?" 
the Pusher asked, much calmer 
now than he had been during 
the two days. "Why did you 
grab me? Have I gone nuts?" 

"No," Talker said, "you are 
not psychotic. We are a galactic 
trading ship. We were blown off 
our course by a storm and our 
Pusher was killed." 

"Well, what does that have to 
do with me?" 

"We would like you to join 
our crew," Talker said, "to be 
our new Pusher." 

r pHE Pusher thought it over 
after the situation was explained to him. Talker could 
catch the feeling of conflict in the 



SPECIALIST 



79 



Pusher's thoughts. He hadn't decided whether to accept this as a 
real situation or not. Finally, the 
Pusher decided that he wasn't 
crazy. 

"Look, boys," he said, "I don't 
know what you are or how this 
makes sense. I have to get out 
of here. I'm on a furlough, and 
if I don't get back soon, the U. S. 
Army's going to be very interested." 

Talker asked the Pusher to 
give him more information about 
"army," and he fed it to Thinker. 

"These Pushers engage in personal combat," was Thinker's 
conclusion. 

"But why?" Talker asked. 
Sadly he admitted to himself 
that Thinker might have been 
right; the Pusher didn't show 
many signs of willingness to cooperate. 

"I'd like to help you lads out," 
Pusher said, "but I've got a war 
to fight. Besides, I don't know 
where you get the idea that I 
could push anything this size. 
You'd need a whole division of 
tanks just to budge it." 

"Do you approve of this war?" 
Talker asked, getting a suggestion from Thinker. 

"Nobody likes war — not those 
who have to do the dying at 
least." 

"Then why do you fight it?" 
The Pusher made a gesture 
with his eating organ, which Eye 



picked up and sent to Thinker. 
"It's kill or be killed. You guys 
know what war is, don't you?" 

"We don't have any wars," 
Talker said. 

"You're lucky," the Pusher 
said bitterly. "We do. Plenty of 
them." 

"Of course," Talker said. He 
had the full explanation from 
Thinker now. "Would you like 
to end them?" 

"Of course I would." 

"Then come with us. Be our 
Pusher." 

The Pusher stood up and 
walked up to an Accumulator. 
He sat down on it and doubled 
the ends of his upper limbs. 

"How the hell can I stop all 
wars?" the Pusher demanded. 
"I'm just Private Dave Martinson. Even if I went to the big 
shots and told them — " 

"You won't have to," Talker 
said. "All you have to do is come 
with us. Push us to our base. 
Galactic will send a Contact 
Team to your planet. That will 
end your wars." 

"The hell you say," the Pusher 
replied. "You boys are stranded 
here, huh? Good enough. No 
monsters are going to take over 
Earth." 

T> EWILDEREDLY, Talker 
tried to understand the reasoning. Had he said something 
wrong? Was it possible that the 



80 




 



Pusher didn't understand him? 

"I thought you wanted to end 
wars," Talker said. 

"Sure I do. But I don't want 
anyone making us stop. I'm no 
traitor. I'd rather fight." 

"No one will make you stop. 
You just will stop because there 
will be no further need for fighting." 

"Do you know why we're 
fighting?" 

"It's obvious." 

"Yeah? What's your explanation?" 

"You Pushers have been separated from the main stream of 
the Galaxy," Talker explained. 
"You have your specialty — pushing — but nothing to Push. Accordingly, you have no real jobs. 
You play with things — metal, 
inanimate objects — but find no 
real satisfaction. Robbed of your 
true vocation, you fight from 
sheer frustration. 

"Once you find your place in 
the galactic Cooperation — and I 
assure you that it is ap important 
place — your fighting will stop. 
Why should you fight, which is 
an unnatural occupation, when 
you can Push? Also, your mechanical civilization will end, 
since there will be no need for 
it." 

The Pusher shook his head in 
what Talker guessed was a gesture of confusion. "What is this 
pushing?" 



Talker told him as best he 
could. Since the job was out of 
his scope, he had only a general 
idea of what a Pusher did. 

"You mean to say that that is 
what every Earthman should be 
doing?" 

"Of course," Talker said. "It is 
your great specialty." 

The Pusher thought about it 
for several minutes. "I think you 
want a physicist or a mentalist 
or something. I could never do 
anything like that. I'm a junior 
architect. And besides — well, it's 
difficult to explain." 

But Talker had already caught 
Pusher's objection. He saw a 
Pusher female in his thoughts. 
No, two, three. And he caught 
a feeling of loneliness, strangeness. The Pusher was filled with 
doubts. He was afraid. 

"When we reach galactic," 
Talker said, hoping it was the 
right thing, "you can meet other 
Pushers. Pusher females, too. All 
you Pushers look alike, so you 
should become friends with 
them. As far as loneliness in the 
Ship goes — it just doesn't exist. 
You don't understand the Cooperation yet. No one is lonely in 
the Cooperation." 

rr*HE Pusher was still consider ing the idea of there being 
other Pushers. Talker couldn't 
understand why he was so startled at that. The Galaxy was 



SPECIALIST 



81 



filled with Pushers, Feeders, 
Talkers, and many other species, 
endlessly duplicated. 

"I can't believe that anybody 
could end all war," Pusher said. 
"How do I know you're not lying? I won't go." 

Talker felt as if he had been 
struck in the face. Thinker must 
have been right when he said 
these Pushers would be uncooperative. Was this going to be the 
end of Talker's career? Were he 
and the rest of the Crew going to 
spend the rest of their lives in 
space, because of the stupidity of 
a bunch of Pushers? 

Even thinking this, Talker was 
able to feel sorry for the Pusher. 
It must be terrible, he thought. 
Doubting, uncertain, never trusting anyone. If these Pushers 
didn't find their place in the Galaxy, they would exterminate 
themselves. Their place in the 
Cooperation was long overdue. 

"What can I do to convince 
you?" Talker asked. 

In despair, he opened all the 
circuits to the Pusher. He let the 
Pusher see Engine's good-natured 
gruffness, the devil - may - care 
humor of the Walls; he showed 
him Eye's poetic attempts, and 
Feeder's cocky good nature. He 
opened his own mind and showed 
the Pusher a picture of his home 
planet, his family, the tree he 
was planning to buy when he 
got home. 



The pictures told the story of 
all of them, from different planets, representing different ethics, 
united by a common bond — the 
galactic Cooperation. 

The Pusher watched it all in 
silence. 

After a while, he shook his 
head. The thought accompanying the gesture was uncertain, 
weak — but negative. 

Talker told the Walls to open. 
They did, and the Pusher looked 
at his own planet in amazement. 

"You may leave," Talker said. 
"Just remove the communication 
line and go." 

"What will you do?" 

"We will look for another 
Pusher planet." 

"Where? Mars? Venus?" 

"We don't know. All we can do 
is hope there is another in this 
region." 

The Pusher looked at the 
opening, then back at the Crew. 
He hesitated and his face screwed 
up in a grimace of indecision. 

"All that you showed me was 
true?" 

No answer was necessary. 

" A LL right," the Pusher said 
suddenly. "I'll go. I'm a 
damned fool, but I'll go. If this 
means what you say — it must 
mean what you say!" 

Talker saw that the agony of 
the Pusher's decision had forced 
him out of contact with reality. 



82 




 



He believed that he was back in 
a dream, where decisions are 
easy and unimportant. 

"There's just one little trouble," Pusher said with the lightness of hysteria. "Boys, I'll be 
hanged if I know how to Push. 
You said something about faster than-light? I can't even run the 
mile in an hour." 

"Of course you can Push," 
Talker assured him, hoping he 
was right. He knew what a Pusher's abilities were; but this one 
. . . "Just try it." 

"Sure," Pusher agreed. "I'll 
probably wake up out of this, 
anyhow." 

They sealed the ship for takeoff while Pusher talked to himself. 

"Funny," Pusher said. "I 
thought a camping trip would be 
a nice way to spend a furlough 
and all I do is get nightmares!" 

Engine boosted the Ship into 
the air. The Walls were sealed 
and Eye was guiding them away 
from the planet. 

"We're in clear space now," 
Talker said. Listening to Pusher, 
he hoped his mind hadn't cracked. "Eye and Thinker will give 
a direction, I'll transmit it to 
you, and you Push along it." 

"You're crazy," Pusher mumbled. "You must have the wrong 
planet. I wish you nightmares 
would go away." 

"You're in the Cooperation 



now," Talker said desperately. 
"There's the direction. Push!" 

The Pusher didn't do anything 
for a moment. He was slowly 
emerging from his fantasy, realizing that he wasn't in a dream, 
after all. He felt the Cooperation. 
Eye to Thinker, Thinker to 
Talker, Talker to Pusher, all intercoordinated with Walls, and 
with each other. 

"What is this?" Pusher asked. 
He felt the oneness of the Ship, 
the great warmth, the closeness 
achieved only in the Cooperation. 

He Pushed. 

Nothing happened. 

"Try again," Talker begged. 

¥>USHER searched his mind. 
-■- He found a deep well of 
doubt and fear. Staring into it, 
he saw his own tortured face. 

Thinker illuminated it for him. 

Pushers had lived with this 
doubt and fear for centuries. 
Pushers had fought through fear, 
killed through doubt. 

That was where the Pusher 
organ was! 

Martinson — specialist, Pusher 
— entered fully into the Crew, 
merged with them, threw mental 
arms around the shoulders of 
Thinker and Talker. 

Suddenly, the Ship shot forward at eight times the speed of 
light. It continued to accelerate.

THE BIRTH OF THE 
SPACE STATION (II) 

1AST month, I told how the 
concept of the manned 
_J rocket in an orbital path 
around the Earth and its possible 
subsequent development into a 
space station was evolved and 
presented by Hermann Oberth in 
1923. After that, very little happened for about six years and the 

84 




 



reason was a popular book. 

Oberth's original work, while 
not long, was very hard reading 
for practically everybody. There 
were pages upon pages of massed 
equations and the "clear text" 
which followed after such a discussion made very little sense unless you had waded through the 
mathematics preceding them. 

Oberth was approached by his 
own publisher with the suggestion 
of writing a popular version of 
his work. He was not opposed to 
the idea in principle, as many 
other German scientists of that 
time would have been, but he 
did not have the time to write it. 
Once or twice, I believe, he actually started to, but each time 
a new and unsuspected and most 
interesting mathematical relationship turned up which, of 
course, had to be investigated 
first. 

Then, one day, a professional 
writer came to Oberth, suggesting 
that they do the book in collaboration. Oberth was to supply the 
information and the writer — his 
name was Max Valier — was to 
do the writing. 

TT did not work out well. Valier 
was not able to follow Oberth's 
mathematical reasoning on many 
points. He suggested "improvements." Oberth tried to explain 
why these suggestions, far from 
being improvements, would not 



work. Sometimes he convinced 
Valier, generally he did not, and 
he had to explain later that Valier's book was, after all, Valier's 
book and not his. His problem 
was that many other people began writing about "Oberth's 
ideas," but took their information 
from Valier. 

As for the space station, Valier 
had not mentioned it at all. He 
had simply skipped that portion 
of Oberth's work. I am not sure 
whether he failed to understand 
the concept or just what prompted him. At any event, instead of 
discussing the space station concept, he described a base on the 
Moon. When I questioned him 
about that once, he declared that 
he could not see why anybody 
should bother to -build a space 
station when we have a readymade natural space station in the 
form of the Moon. 

I tried to reason with him that 
hauling anything to the Moon is 
obviously much more difficult 
than hauling the same thing to 
a height of, say, 1000 miles and 
providing it with a lateral push 
so that it would take up an orbit 
and stay there. 

Valier replied that hauling 
something to an orbit would require a velocity of about 5.5 miles 
per second (including air resistance and a safety factor) while 
hauling something to the Moon 
would require "just 1.5 miles per 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



85 



second more." ('Tain't so. Seven 
miles per second will merely get 
you through the Earth's gravitational field. Then you need additional fuel to brake your fall and 
to adapt to the orbital velocity of 
the Moon.) Furthermore, Valier 
insisted, you would have to haul 
"everything" to the space station's orbit, but only essentials to 
the Moon, where you could build 
what you need from raw materials to be found there. (Optimistic, 
to put it mildly.) 

Still thinking I might win, I 
pointed out that if the primary 
purpose of a space station were 
to serve as a refueling place for 
interplanetary ships, a ship leaving from the station would have 
a speed of some 4.5 miles per second relative to the Earth, and 
would only have to make up the 
difference between 4.5 miles per 
second and the actual velocity 
required for the interplanetary 
trip, which would be some 8.5 — 9 
miles per second relative to 
Earth. The moon, I then said, 
has an orbital velocity of only 
0.6 miles per second and more 
than that is needed even to overcome its own gravitational field. 

No go. Valier insisted that the 
raw material for fuel would be 
found on the Moon, too, so it 
would be unimportant that the 
Moon's orbital velocity is of no 
real help. 

Since his answers were pat, 



while my own portion of the discussion came out slowly and 
gropingly, I feel sure that he had 
had the same discussion with 
Oberth before and had not been 
convinced. And since, as I have 
already said, people absorbed 
Oberth's ideas from Valier's book, 
there was no space station discussion for quite some time afterward. 

T^HE first book largely devoted 
to the idea of the space station 
appeared in 1929. Its author was 
an Austrian by the name of Potocnic who wrote under the pen 
name of Herman Noordung. The 
title page of his book stated that 
he was an engineer and a captain 
in the reserve. To this day, I have 
failed to find out whether these 
two statements belonged together 
— meaning that he was a captain 
in the engineer corps — or whether 
one was his peacetime occupation and the other a wartime commission. 

The title of the book was Das 
Problem der Befahrung des Weltlaums ("The Problem of Travel 
in Space") and Potocnic-Noordung succeeded in getting himself 
into the bad graces of all the 
rocket men at once by producing 
a fantastic method for calculating overall efficiency. Another 
point on which he failed to make 
friends was his insistence that a 
space station should be located 



86 




 



over the equator, 22,300 miles 
above mean sea level. At such a 
distance, the station would need 
precisely 24 hours to go around 
the Earth once. If it moved in an 
easterly direction, it would seem 
to stand still over one point of 
the equator. 

For reasons I still don't understand, Potocnic-Noordung considered this a great advantage, 
though actually such a position 
would be full of drawbacks. The 
station could be seen from only 
one hemisphere, but it could also 
observe only one hemisphere. Because of the long distance — costly 
in fuel consumption — it could not 
even observe very well. 

But he did have a number of 
interesting ideas. His proposed 
space station consisted of three 
units: the "living wheel" (as he 
called it), the "power house" and 
the "observatory." 

The first was to be a wheel shaped unit, about 100 feet in diameter, which was to spin around 
its hub so as to substitute centrifugal force for gravity around 
the rim. Of course the entrance 
was in the hub and he drew a 
diagram of a counter-rotating airlock for the hub. 

Potocnic-Noordung also pointed out that there would be a 
slight difference in apparent gravity between the head and the feet 
of a man standing upright, and 
said that one would have to com


pensate for this while moving, 
especially if it came to vertical 
movements. He stated correctly 
that power could be had free 
from the Sun, by means of a 
condensing mirror and steam 
boiler pipe. 

Along with these essentially 
correct thoughts, however, there 
ran a number of boners. For example, he wanted to spin the 
wheel so rapidly that the centrifugal force inside would be one 
full g. This would require one 
complete revolution in 8 seconds. 
Actually there is no need for one 
full g inside a space station, just 
as there is no need for sea-level 
air-pressure. Even untrained people are adaptable enough so that 
i/i g and about half-sea-level 
pressure (with a higher oxygen 
content) would be sufficient. This 
would cut down the number of 
revolutions per minute required 
and lighten the whole structure 
very considerably. 

A NOTHER of Potocnic-Noordung's misconceptions I always look at with a smile is the 
design of his windows. They are 
slightly convex lenses and many 
of the windows are also equipped 
with a plane mirror in a frame on 
the outside, adjusted to reflect 
additional sunlight into the interior of the station. What everybody forgot until recently is that 
people aren't cold-blooded and 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



87 



that the "heating device" for a 
spacesuit is the guy inside. In 
fact, these "heating devices" are 
so annoyingly efficient that the 
main worry of the modern space 
engineer is how to get rid of all 
the surplus heat. 

The second unit, the "observatory," was not described in much 
detail. It was merely stated that 
it would be cylindrical, like a 
boiler, to maintain pressure inside and that it would contain 
all the astronomical instruments. 
It was not supposed to rotate, but 
was to be connected with the 
main station or "living wheel" by 
two electric cables and a flexible 
air hose. It was to be properly 
heated simply by piping air of 
the right temperature into it, 
while the power cables were to 
supply electricity for the instrumentation. 

The third unit, the "power 
house," was mostly a large parabolic mirror with a set of boiler 
pipes along the focal line (the 
description grew more and more 
vague) and the current generated 
was to be supplied to the "living 
wheel" or else to be stored in 
storage batteries. 

As regards the purpose of the 
whole space station, PotocnicNoordung merely paraphrased 
Oberth : Earth observation, astronomical observation, possible 
warlike action by means of a 
solar mirror and possible storage 



of fuels for long distance trips. 

During the same yedr, 1929, 
there appeared a series of articles 
on the space station concept by 
another author, Count Guido von 
Pirquet, then Secretary of the 
Austrian Society for Space Travel 
Research. The articles were published in the monthly journal Die 
Rakete ("The Rocket") of the 
German Society for Space Travel, 
usually abbreviated as VfR. 

While Potocnic-Noordung had 
devoted a lot of attention to design detail and virtually none at 
all to the optimum orbit, von 
Pirquet did not say a word about 
design detail, but calculated carefully where his space station 
should be located and why. In the 
course of these calculations, von 
Pirquet discovered a fundamental 
fact which has often been quoted 
since : 

You can't have space travel at 
all with chemical fuels unless you 
build a space station first. 

A secondary but almost equally 
important discovery was that the 
building of the space station, the 
necessary first step, is also the 
most difficult. 

Everything that comes afterward is simple, or almost so, by 
comparison. 

TT should be obvious by now 
that the various possible purposes of a space station are to 
some slight extent contradictory. 



88 




 



From the point of view of fuel 
economy, the nearer the Earth, 
the better. 

From the point of view of 
Earth observation, you also do 
generally better if you are close, 
but the 'limits are somewhat different. You don't want to be quite 
as close as you would like to be 
from the standpoint of fuel economy. 

From the point of view of refueling depot for long range trips, 
you may have trouble making up 
your mind. A "low" orbit will 
provide you with a higher orbital 
velocity, but a somewhat higher 
orbit might give you more room 
for maneuvering. The modern 
compromise orbit is the one advocated by Dr. Wernher von 
Braun — 1075 miles above sea 
level, which would produce a period of revolution around the 
Earth o/ precisely two hours. 

Count von Pirquet solved this 
dilemma in a different way. Like 
Potocnic-Noordung, he advocated 
a three-unit station. But the three 
units were to run in three different orbits. 

The one closest to Earth, the 
so-called Inner Station, was to 
revolve 470 miles above sea level 
with an orbital period of 100 minutes. The one farthest away, the 
so-called Outer Station, was to 
circle the Earth 3100 miles from 
the surface with an orbital period 
of 200 minutes. The third, or 



Transit Station, was to be on an 
elliptical orbit touching the other 
two orbits. Its distance from the 
surface would therefore vary from 
470 to 3100 miles and its orbital 
period would be 150 minutes. 
When closely approaching either 
the Inner or the Outer Station, 
the velocity of the Transit Station would not match. There 
would be a velocity difference of 
about Yn mile per second which 
would have to be adjusted for the 
men and materials to be transferred. 

While the two statements at 
which von Pirquet arrived while 
working on the problem of the 
space station are still valid and 
correct, his suggestion for a station consisting of several units in 
different orbits has not borne any 
fruit. 

A FTER the publication of these 
articles, there was another hiatus in the development of the 
space station concept, lasting 
longer than the first, about twenty 
years. But then a lot of people 
started work in earnest. A good 
many of the papers read at the 
Second International Congress for 
Astronautics in London, 1951, 
concerned one phase or another 
of the space station concept. 
Somewhat earlier, Wernher von 
Braun had published his concept 
in the book Space Medicine; a 
few months later, it was revised 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



89 



after prolonged discussions and 
published in its present form in 
the book Across the Space Frontier. 

Needless to say that the various concepts published do not 
closely agree with each other, for 
there is room for a variety of 
opinions. Obviously the space 
station will look different if designer A assumes heating by solar 
radiation, something which is 
known and can be calculated 
right now, while designer B assumes that the atomic engineers 
will have come up with a useful 
small atomic reactor during the 
time it took the rocket engineers 
to produce a suitable cargo-carrying rocket to bring the space station's material up into an orbit. 

Although we can predict a 
good deal of detail right now, 
some of this will be subject to 
change during the next decade. 
We can be sure of one thing only : 

There will be a space station 
in the reasonably near future. 

SLOWPOKE THOUGHT 

T FORGET whether the villain 
■■- drew his blaster with lightning speed or with the speed of 
light. No matter, for the worthy 
hero drew his with the speed of 
thought, so justice naturally 
triumphed. 

This column being what it is, 
my readers will now expect me 



to tabulate the figures for these 
various speeds in kilometers or 
in miles per second. And that is 
just what I am going to do, not 
wasting any time with the wellknown speed of light, but getting 
right down to the speed of 
thought. 

We cannot actually measure 
the speed of a thought, but for 
this purpose we may consider 
thought a nerve impulse and we 
can measure that. If somebody 
drops a five-pound weight on 
your foot, you feel this "at once." 
This is not due to any fantastic 
speed of the nerve impulse, 
though, but merely to the fact 
that it is only about two yards 
from your foot to your brain. 

As I said, the speed of such 
a nerve impulse can be measured, 
the main difficulty being simply 
that you deal with a relatively 
high speed over a short distance. 
Nothing organic which can be 
used for such experiments is very 
long. Consequently the figures 
found by the various experimenters differ somewhat. 

The lowest figure I have seen 
reported was 40 meters (131 feet) 
per second, the highest 70 meters 
(226 feet) per second. That higher 
figure corresponds to 252 kilometers or 157 miles per hour. 

In Germany, some 50 years 
ago, they used to say that the 
principle of the electric telegraph 
was easy to understand: just

imagine a dachshund long enough 
to reach from one city to another. 
You step on its tail in Berlin and 
he'll bark in Hamburg. If we use 
that dachshund under American 
conditions, his tail ends at the 
Loop in Chicago while his head 
is at Times Square in New York. 

Now let's translate that into 
neural speed. 

A driver in Chicago carelessly 
rolls his car over the tail while 
hurrying out to the airport, which 
is some forty minutes of hard 
driving. While the driver fights 
for his reservation — "I did confirm it, Miss!" — the nerve impulse 
races through the long dachshund's nerve fibers, having just 
about passed Waterloo in Indiana 
when the DC-6 experimentally 
wags its ailerons prior to takeoff. 
Then there is a little delay because somebody else wants to 
land; the nerve impulse is still 
racing. 

The DC-6 overtakes it in the 
general vicinity of Cleveland and 
lands at La Guardia airport while 
the nerve impulse is speeding 
somewhere to the north of Pittsburgh. The man who started it 
all in Chicago can wait for his 
baggage, stand in line for a taxi 
and have a leisurely meal in a 
restaurant on Times Square, waiting for the "bark" to arrive. 

It does arrive — 4 hours and 40 
minutes after it was started. 

All this is under the assumption 



that the speed of a nerve impulse 
actually is 70 meters per second. 
It may be as low as 40 meters 
per second, which amounts to just 
90 miles per hour. Of course, inside the body, with a maximum 
distance of six feet to travel — 14 
feet in the case of a giraffe — 90 
mph serves as well as 150 mph 
and improving it to 300 mph, if 
that could be done, would probably not make any noticeable 
difference. 

But when it comes to really 
long distances, pick something 
faster than the speed of a nerve 
impulse.

ANY QUESTIONS? 

/ would like to know if you 
think that meteorite craters larger 
than Chubb Crater in Canada 
will be found on Earth. 

Stephen Maran 
500 St. John's PL 
Brooklyn 16, N. Y. 
I am convinced that craters 
of meteoric origin larger than 
Chubb Crater exist on Earth. 
In fact, there are several formations which are suspected of 
being just that. 

One is Lake Bosumtvi in 
Ashantiland in Africa, only a 
few degrees from the equator. 
This perfectly circular lake has 
a diameter of six miles and the 
general geology of the area is 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

such that meteoric origin is the 
easiest explanation for its existence. 

Another suspected crater is 
the so-called Pretoria Salt Pan 
in South Africa, which has an 
even larger diameter— on the 
order of twenty miles. 

So far, the meteoric origin of 
these formations has not been 
proved, but I understand that 
some work on the Pretoria Salt 
Pan is in progress. The problem, as you can see from the 
foregoing, is not the finding of 
larger formations that might be 
impact craters, but establishing 
proof that they actually are 
such. 

In your article on the satellites 
of the Solar System (March 1952 
GALAXY), you spoke of Pluto 
as being moonless. 

Is this an established fact or an 
assumption because of lack of 
other evidence? 

B. Rule 

Haverford, Penna. 
When I said that Pluto is 
"moonless," I meant, of course, 
that no moon of Pluto is known. 
Since Pluto has been under 
pretty intensive observation 
from the time of its discovery, 
the two statements "Pluto is 
moonless" and "no satellite of 
Pluto has been discovered so 
far" mean pretty nearly the 
same thing. 



Are the large constellations in 
the skies, such as Leo, Orion, 
Ursus major and minor, etc., 
parts of our galaxy? 

Alexander Bozic 
9265 Shore Road 
Brooklyn 9, N. Y. 
Yes. The constellations you 
name, and all the others which 
could be listed, consist of stars 
that belong to our galaxy. 

The only naked-eye object in 
the northern sky which does not 
belong to our galaxy is the so- ' 
called nebula in Andromeda 
which is the nearest other 
galaxy. 

From the southern hemisphere, you can see two other 
objects which are not members 
of our galaxy— or only once 
removed — namely, the two Magellanic Clouds. They are clouds 
of stars outside our galaxy 
proper, but they are what some 
astronomers call "satellite galaxies," quite close to our own, 
as galactic distances go. I am 
not certain if it is known yet 
whether the Magellanic Clouds 
share the rotation of our galaxy, 
but I would expect them to do 
so. 

Recently I heard (name deleted) say during a radio interview that the Flying Saucers 
originated from the star Wolf 359, 
about eight light-years away. 
What authority is there for mak


92 




 



ing such a statement? Does Wolf 
359 have a planetary system? Is 
there any other information on 
this star obtainable?

Even if there were any evidence that the so-called Flying 
Saucers are visitors from another solar system, the star 
Wolf 359 is about the silliest 
possible choice. If it has been 
picked merely because it is not 
very far away (as measured in 
light-years), I don't see why the 
alleged experts did not settle for 
Alpha Centauri. 

Alpha Centauri is only about 
half as far away as Wolf 359. 
It also is a big binary, both 



components of which are bright 
stars. 

Little Wolf 359 is one of the 
faintest stars on record. Its absolute magnitude is 18.5 and if 
it were not so near, we wouldn't 
even know that it exists. The 
amount of energy emitted 
from its surface is just about 
l/50,000th of that of our own 
sun — it would take fifty thousand of Wolf 359's caliber to 
make one Sol. 

We don't know whether Little 
Wolfie has a planetary system, 
but with an energy output like 
that, its planets would be in a 
sorry plight. Naturally, an "expert" would use that as a reason for coming to our solar 
system — and one probably will. 



IT S FOR YOU! 

The big news for us, of course, is the birth of BEYOND, the all-fantasy 
companion magazine to GALAXY. Since almost all writers of science fiction 
also enjoy writing fantasy, it seems reasonable that fantasy should appeal 
to almost all science fiction readers . . . and we have a power-lineup of 
stories in the first issue that should convince you that you will like fantasy: 

. . . AND MY FEAR IS GREAT ... is an eerily exciting novella with a 
full charge of the literary magic that Theodore Sturgeon is noted for. 

It's aided by two sorcerer's journeymen novelets: BABEL II by Damon 
Knight, which brings a frightful Biblical incident clear up to date, and T. L. 
Sherred's EYE FOR INIQUITY, which proves that wishing can be profitable, 
though not necessarily fun, considering the complications; and a host of 
mesmeric, short stories to help conjure up a stimulating new magazine that 
belongs right beside GALAXY on your library shelf and end-table.

Not to be or not to no* be... 
that was the not-question for 
the invader of the not-world. 

Illustrated by EMSH 



DEAR Editor: 
My 14 year old boy, 
Ronnie, is typing this 
letter for me because he can do 
it neater and use better grammar. 
I had to get in touch with somebody about this because if there 
is something to it, then somebody, everybody, is going to 
point finger at me, Ivan Smernda, and say, "Why didn't you 
warn us?" 

I could not go to the police be


94 



cause they are not too friendly 
to me because of some of my 
guests who frankly are stew 
bums. Also they might think I 
was on booze, too, or maybe the 
hops, and get my license revoked. 
I run a strictly legit hotel even 
though some of my guests might 
be down on their luck now and 
then. 

What really got me mixed up 
in this was the mysterious disappearance of two of my guests. 
They both took a powder last 
Wednesday morning. 

Now get this. In one room, that 
of Joe Binkle, which maybe is 
an alias, I find nothing but a suit 
of clothes, some butts and the 
letters I include here in same 
package. Binkle had only one 
suit. That I know. And this was 
it laying right in the middle of 
the room. Inside the coat was the 
vest, inside the vest the shirt, 
inside the shirt the underwear. 
The pants were up in the coat and 
inside of them was also the underwear. All this was buttoned 
up like Binkle had melted out of 
it and dripped through a crack in 
the floor. In a bureau drawer were 
the letters I told you about. 

Now. In the room right under 
Binkle's lived another stew bum 
that checked in Thursday . . . 
name Ed Smith, alias maybe, too. 
This guy was a real case. He 
brought with him a big mirror 
with a heavy bronze frame. Air


loom, he says. He pays a week in 
advance, staggers up the stairs 
to his room with the mirror and 
that's the last I see of him. 

In Smith's room on Wednesday 
I find only a suit of clothes, the 
same suit he wore when he came 
in. In the coat the vest, in the 
vest the shirt, in the shirt the 
underwear. Also in the pants. 
Also all in the middle of the 
floor. Against the far wall stands 
the frame of the mirror. Only the 
frame! 

WHAT a spot to be in! Now 
it might have been a gag. 
Sometimes these guys get funny 
ideas when they are on the stuff. 
But then I read the letters. This 
knocks me for a loop. They are 
all in different handwritings. All 
from different places. Stamps all 
legit, my kid says. India, China, 
England, everywhere. 

My kid, he reads. He Says it's 
no joke. He wants to call the 
cops or maybe some doctor. But 
I say no. He reads your magazine so he says write to you, send 
you the letters. You know what to 
do. Now you have them. Maybe 
you print. Whatever you do, Mr. 
Editor, remember my place, the 
Plaza Ritz Arms, is straight establishment. I don't drink. I 
never touch junk, not even aspirin. 

Yours very truly,

Bombay, India 
June 8 

Mr. Joe Binkle 
Plaza Ritz Arms 
New York City 
Dear Joe: 

Greetings, greetings, greetings. 
Hold firm in your wretched projection, for tomorrow you will not 
be alone in the not-world. In two 
days I, Glmpauszn, will be born. 

Today I hang in our newly developed not-pod just within the 
mirror gateway, torn with the 
agony that we calculated must go 
with such tremendous wavelength 
fluctuations. I have attuned myself to a fetus within the body of 
a not-woman in the not-world. 
Already I am static and for hours 
have looked into this weird extension of the Universe with fear 
and trepidation. 

As soon as my stasis was 
achieved, I tried to contact you, 
but got no response. What could 
have diminished your powers of 
articulate wave interaction to 
make you incapable of receiving 
my messages and returning them? 
My wave went out to yours and 
found it, barely pulsing and surrounded with an impregnable chimera. 

Quickly, from the not -world vibrations about you, I learned the 
not-knowledge of your location. 
So I must communicate with you 
by what the not-world calls 
"mail" till we meet. For this pur


pose I must utilize the feeble vibrations of various not-people 
through whose inadequate articulation I will attempt to make my 
moves known to you. Each time 
I will pick a city other than the 
one I am in at the time. 

I, Glmpauszn, come equipped 
with powers evolved from your 
fragmentary reports before you 
ceased to vibrate to us and with 
a vast treasury of facts from indirect sources. Soon our tortured 
people will be free of the fearsome not-folk and I will be their 
Jiberator. You failed in your 
task, but I will try to get you off 
with light punishment when we 
return again. 

The hand that writes this letter 
is that of a boy in the not-city of 
Bombay in the not-country of 
India. He does not know he writes 
it.- Tomorrow it will be someone 
else. You must never know of my 
exact location, for the not-people 
might have access to the information. 

I must leave off now because 
the not-child is about to be born. 
When it is alone in the room, it 
will be spirited away and I will 
spring from the pod on the gateway into its crib and will be its 
exact vibrational likeness. 

I have tremendous powers. But 
the not-people must never know 
I am among them. This is the 
only way I could arrive in the 
room where the gateway lies 



96 




 



without arousing suspicion. I will 
grow up as the not-child in order 
that I might destroy the notpeople completely. 

All is well, only they shot this 
information file into my matrix 
too fast. I'm having a hard time 
sorting facts and make the right 
decision. Gezsltrysk, what a task! 

Farewell till later. 

Glmpauszn 

Wichita, Kansas

Dear Joe: 

Mnghjkl, fhfjgfhjklop phelnoprausynks. No. When I communicate with you, I see I must 
avoid those complexities of procedure for which there" are no 
terms in this language. There is 
no way of describing to you in 
not-language what I had to go 
through during the first moments 
of my birth. 

Now I know what difficulties 
you must have had with your 
limited equipment. These notpeople are unpredictable and 
strange. Their doctor came in and 
weighed me again the day after 
my birth. Consternation reigned 
when it was discovered I was ten 
pounds heavier. What difference 
could it possibly make? Many 
doctors then came in to see me. 
As they arrived hourly, they 
found me heavier and heavier. 
Naturally, since I am growing. 
This is part of my instructions. 



Mynot-mother (Gezsltrysk!) then 
burst into tears. The doctors conferred, threw up their hands and 
left. 

I learned the following day 
that the opposite component of 
my not-mother, my not-father, 
had been away riding on some 
conveyance during my birth. He 
was out on . . . what did they call 
it? Oh, yes, a bender. He did not 
arrive till three days after I was 
born. 

When I heard them say that 
he was straightening up to come 
see me, I made a special effort 
and grew marvelously in one afternoon. I was 36 not-world 
inches tall by evening. My notfather entered while I was standing by the crib examining a 
syringe the doctor had left behind. He stopped in his tracks on 
entering the room and seemed 
incapable of speech. 

Dredging into the treasury of 
knowledge I had come equipped 
with, I produced the proper 
phrase for occasions of this kind 
in the not -world. 

"Poppa," I said. 

This was the first use I had 
made of the so-called vocal cords 
that are now part of my extended 
matrix. The sound I emitted 
sounded low-pitched, guttural 
and penetrating even to myself. 
It must have jarred on my notfather's ears, for he turned and 
ran shouting from the room. 



A GLEEB FOR EARTH 



97 



They apprehended him on the 
stairs and I heard him babble 
something about my being a 
monster and no child of his. My 
not-mother appeared at the doorway and instead of being pleased 
at the progress of my growth, she 
fell down heavily. She made a 
distinct thump on the floor. 

This brought the rest of them 
on the run, so I climbed out the 
window and retreated across a 
nearby field. A prolonged search 
was launched, but I eluded them. 
What unpredictable beings! 

I reported my tremendous 
progress back to our world, including the cleverness by which 
I managed to escape my pursuers. I received a reply from 
Blgftury which, on careful analysis, seems to be small praise indeed. In fact, some of his phrases 
apparently contain veiled threats. 
But you know old Blgftury. He 
wanted to go on this expedition 
himself and it's his nature never 
to flatter anyone. 

From now on I will refer to 
not-people simply as people, 
dropping the qualifying preface 
except where comparisons must 
be made between this alleged 
world and our own. It is merely 
an offshoot of our primitive 
mythology when this was considered a spirit world, just as 
these people refer to our world as 
never-never land and other 
anomalies. But we learned other


wise, while they never have. 

New sensations crowd into my 
consciousness and I am having 
a hard time classifying them. 
Anyway, I shall carry on swiftly 
now to the inevitable climax in 
which I singlehanded will obliterate the terror of the not-world 
and return to our world a hero. 
I cannot understand your not 
replying to my letters. I have 
given you a box number. What 
could have happened to your vibrations? 

Glmpauszn 

Albuquerque, New Mexico 
June 15 
Dear Joe: 

I had tremendous difficulty 
getting a letter off to you this 
time. My process — original with 
myself, by the way — is to send 
out feeler vibrations for what 
these people call the psychic individual. Then I establish contact 
with him while he sleeps and 
compel him without his knowledge to translate my ideas into 
written language. He writes my 
letter and mails it to you. Of 
course, he has no awareness of 
what he has done. 

My first five tries were unfortunate. Each time I took control 
of an individual who could not 
read or write! Finally I found my 
man, but I fear his words are 
limited. Ah, well. I had great 
things to tell you about my prog


98 




 



ress, but I cannot convey even a 
hint of how I have accomplished 
these miracles through the thick 
skull of this incompetent. 

In simple terms then: I crept 
into a cave and slipped into a 
kind of sleep, directing my 
squhjkl ulytz & uhrytzg . . . no, 
it won't come out. Anyway, I 
grew overnight to the size of an 
average person here. 

As I said before, floods of impressions are driving into my 
xzbyl . . . my brain . . . from 
various nerve and sense areas and 
I am having a hard time classifying them. My one idea was to get 
to a chemist and acquire the 
stuff needed for the destruction 
of these people. 

Sunrise came as I expected. 
According to my catalog of 
information, the impressions 
aroused by it are of beauty. It 
took little conditioning for me 
finally to react in this manner. 
This is truly an efficient mechanism I inhabit. 

I gazed about me at the mixture of lights, forms and impressions. It was strange and . . . 
now I know . . . beautiful. However, I hurried immediately 
toward the nearest chemist. At 
the same time I looked up and 
all about me at the beauty. 

Soon an individual approached. 
I knew what to do from my information. I simply acted natural. You know, one of your 



earliest instructions was to realize 
that these people see nothing unusual in you if you do not let 
yourself believe they do. 

This individual I classified as 
a female of a singular variety 
here. Her hair was short, her 
upper torso clad in a woolen garment. She wore . . . what are 
they? . . . oh, yes, sneakers. My 
attention was diverted by a 
scream as I passed her. I stopped. 

The woman gesticulated and 
continued to scream. People hurried from nearby houses. I linked 
my hands behind me and 
watched the scene with an attitude of mild interest. They 
weren't interested in me, I told 
myself. But they were. 

I became alarmed, dived into 
a bush and used a mechanism 
that you unfortunately do not 
have — invisibility. I lay there and 
listened. 

"He was stark naked," the girl 
with the sneakers said. 

A figure I recognized as a police 
officer spoke to her. 

"Lizzy, you'll just have to keep 
these crackpot friends of yours 
out of this area." 

"But—" 

"No more buck-bathing, Lizzy," the officer ordered. "No more 
speeches in the Square. Not when 
it results in riots at five in the 
morning. Now where is your 
naked friend? I'm going to make 
an example of him."

That was it — I had forgotten 
clothes. There is only one answer 
to this oversight on my part. My 
mind is confused by the barrage 
of impressions that assault it. I 
must retire now and get them all 
classified. Beauty, pain, fear, 
hate, love, laughter. I don't know 
one from the other. I must feel 
each, become accustomed to it. 

The more I think about it, the 
more I realize that the information I have been given is very 
unrealistic. You have been inefficient, Joe. What will Blgftury 
and the others say of this? My 
great mission is impaired. Farewell, till I find a more intelligent 
mind so I can write you with 
more enlightenment.

Dear Joe: 

I received your first communication today. It baffles me. Do 
you greet me in the proper fringezone manner? No. Do you express 
joy, hope, pride, helpfulness at 
my arrival? No. You ask me for 
a loan of five bucks! 

It took me some time, culling 
my information catalog to come 
up with the correct variant of 
the slang term "buck." Is it possible that you are powerless even 
to provide yourself with the 
wherewithal to live in this inferior 
world? 



A reminder, please. You and I 
— I in particular — are now engaged in a struggle to free our 
world from the terrible, maiming 
intrusions of this not-world. 
Through many long gleebs, our 
people have lived a semi-terrorized existence while errant vibrations from this world ripped 
across the closely joined vibration 
flux, whose individual fluctuations make up our sentient population. 

Even our eminent, all-high 
Frequency himself has often been 
jeopardized by these people. The 
not-world and our world are like 
two baskets as you and I see 
them in our present forms. Baskets woven with the greatest intricacy, design and color; but 
baskets whose convex sides are 
joined by a thin fringe of filaments. Our world, on the vibrational plane, extends just a bit 
into this, the not-world. But being a world of higher vibration, 
it is ultimately tenuous to these 
gross peoples. While we vibrate 
only within a restricted plane because of our purer, more stable 
existence, these people radiate 
widely into our world. 

They even send what they call 
psychic reproductions of their 
own selves into ours. And most 
infamous of all, they sometimes 
are able to force some of our individuals over the fringe into their 
world temporarily, causing them 



100 




 



much agony and fright. 

The latter atrocity is perpetrated through what these people 
call mediums, spiritualists and 
other fatuous names. I intend to 
visit one of them at the first 
opportunity to see for myself. 

Meanwhile, as to you, I would 
offer a few words of advice. I 
picked them up while examining 
the "slang" portion of my information catalog which you unfortunately caused me to use. So, 
for the ultimate cause — in this, 
the penultimate adventure, and 
for the glory and peace of our 
world — shake a leg, bub. 
Straighten up and fly right. In 
short, get hep. 

As far as^he five bucks is concerned, no dice.

Dear Joe: 

Your letter was imponderable 
till I had thrashed through long 
passages in my information catalog that I had never imagined I 
would need. Biological functions 
and bodily processes which are 
labeled here "revolting" are used 
freely in your missive. You can 
be sure they are all being forwarded to Blgftury. If I were not 
involved in the most important 
part of my journey — completion 
of the weapon against the notworlders — I would come to New 



York immediately. You would 
rue that day, I assure you. 

Glmpauszn 

Boise, Idaho 
July 15 

Dear Joe: 

A great deal has happened to 
me since I wrote to you last. Systematically, I have tested each 
emotion and sensation listed in 
our catalog. I have been, as has 
been said in this world, like a 
reed bending before the winds of 
passion. In fact, I'm rather badly 
bent indeed. Ah! You'll pardon 
me, but I just took time for what 
is known quaintly in this tongue 
as a "hooker of red-eye" Ha! 
I've mastered even the vagaries 
of slang in the not-language . . . 
Ahhh! Pardon me again. I feel 
much better now. 

You see, Joe, as I attuned myself to the various impressions 
that constantly assaulted my 
mind through this body, I conditioned myself to react exactly as 
our information catalog instructed me to. 

Now it is all automatic, pure 
reflex. A sensation comes to me 
when I am burned; then I experience a burning pain. If the sensation is a tickle, I experience a 
tickle. 

This morning I have what is 
known medically as a syndrome 
. . . a group of symptoms popularly referred to as a hangover 



A GLEEB FOR EARTH 



101 



. . . Ahhh! Pardon me again. 
Strangely . . . now what was I 
saying? Oh, yes. Ha, ha. Strangely enough, the reactions that 
come easiest to the people in this 
world came most difficult to me. 
Money-love, for example. It is a 
great thing here, both among 
those who haven't got it and those 
who have. 

I went out and got plenty of 
money. I walked invisible into a 
bank and carried away piles of 
it. Then I sat and looked at it. 
I took the money to a remote 
room of the twenty room suite I 
have rented in the best hotel here 
in — no, sorry — and stared at it 
for hours. 

Nothing happened. I didn't 
love the stuff or feel one way or 
the other about it. Yet all around 
me people are actual^ killing one 
another for the love of it. 

Anyway . . . Ahhh. Pardon me. 
I got myself enough money to 
fill ten or fifteen rooms. By the 
end of the week I should have 
all eighteen spare rooms filled 
with money. If I don't love it 
then, I'll feel I have failed. This 
alcohol is taking effect now. 

Blgftury has been goading me 
for reports. To hell with his reports! I've got a lot more emotions to try, such as romantic 
love. I've been studying this phenomenon, along with other racial 
characteristics of these people, in 
the movies. This is the best place 



to see these people as they really 
are. They all go into the movie 
houses and there do homage to 
their own images. Very quaint 
type of idolatry. 

Love. Ha! What an adventure 
this is becoming. . 

By the way, Joe, I'm forwarding that five dollars. You see, it 
won't cost me anything. It'll come 
out of the pocket of the idiot 
who's writing this letter. Pretty 
shrewd of me, eh? 

I'm going out and look at that 
money again. I think I'm at last 
learning to love it, though not as 
much as I admire liquor. Well, 
one simply must persevere, I always say. 

CHmpauszn 

Penobscot, Maine 
July 20 

Dear Joe: 

Now you tell me not to drink 
alcohol. Why not? You never 
mentioned it in any of your vibrations to us, gleebs ago, when 
you first came across to this 
world. It will stint my powers? 
Nonsense! Already I have had a 
quart of the liquid today. I feel 
wonderful. Get that? I actually 
feel wonderful, in spite of this 
miserable imitation of a body. 

There are long hours during 
which I am so well-integrated 
into this body and this world that 
I almost consider myself a member of it. Now I can function 



102 




 



efficiently. I sent Blgftury some 
long reports today outlining my 
experiments in the realm of 
chemistry where we must finally 
defeat these people. Of course, I 
haven't made the experiments 
yet, but I will. This is not deceit, 
merely realistic anticipation of 
the inevitable. Anyway, what the 
old xbyzrt doesn't know won't 
muss his vibrations. 

I went to what they call a 
nightclub here and picked out a 
blonde-haired woman, the kind 
that the books say men prefer. 
She was attracted to me instantly. 
After all, the body I have devised 
is perfect in every detail . . . 
actually a not-world ideal. 

I didn't lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities. I 
remember distinctly that just as 
I stooped to pick Up a large roll 
of money I had dropped, her eyes 
met mine and in them I could see 
her admiration. We went to my 
suite and I showed her one of the 
money rooms. Would you believe 
it? She actually took off her shoes 
and ran around through the 
money in her bare feet! Then we 
kissed. 

Concealed in the dermis of the 
lips are tiny, highly sensitized 
nerve ends which send sensations 
to the brain. The brain interprets 
these impulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in the adrenals on the ends 
of the kidneys increases and an 



enlivening of the -entire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt 
the beginnings of love. 

I sat her down on a pile of 
money and kissed her again. 
Again the tingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myself quickly. 

Now in all the motion pictures 
— true representations of life and 
love in this world — the man with 
a lot of money or virtue kisses 
the girl and tries to induce her to 
do something biological. She 
then refuses. This pleases both of 
them, for he wanted her to refuse. 
She, in turn, wanted him to want 
her, but also wanted to prevent 
him so that he would have a high 
opinion of her. Do I make myself 
clear? 

I kissed the blonde girl and 
gave her to understand what I 
then wanted. Well, you can imagine my surprise when she said 
yes! So I had failed. I had not 
found love. 

I became so abstracted by this 
problem that the blonde girl fell 
asleep. I thoughtfully drank 
quantities of excellent alcohol 
called gin and didn't even notice 
when the blonde girl left. 

I am now beginning to feel the 
effects of this alcohol again. Ha. 
Don't I wish old Blgftury were 
here in the vibrational pattern of 
an olive? I'd get the blonde in 
and have her eat him out of a 
Martini. That is a gin mixture.

I think I'll get a hot report off 
to the old so-and-so right now. 
It'll take him a gleeb to figure 
this one out. I'll tell him I'm 
setting up an atomic reactor in 
the sewage systems here and that 
all we have to do is activate it 
and all the not-people will die of 
chain asphyxiation. 

Boy, what an easy job this 
turned out to be. It's just a vacation. Joe, you old gold-bricker, 
imagine you here all these gleebs 
living off the fat of the land. Yak, 
yak. Affectionately. 

Glmpauszn 

Sacramento, Calif. 
July 25 

Dear Joe: 

All is lost unless we work 
swiftly. I received your revealing 
letter the morning after having 
a terrible experience of my own. 
I drank a lot of gin for two days 
and then decided to go to one 
of these seance things. 

Somewhere along the way I 
picked up a red-headed girl. 
When we got to the darkened 
seance room, I took the redhead 
into a corner and continued my 
investigations into the realm of 
love. I failed again because she 
said yes immediately. 

The nerves of my dermis were 
working over time when suddenly 
I had the most frightening expedience of my life. Now I know 
what a horror these people really 



are to our world. 

The medium had turned out 
all the lights. He said there was 
a strong psychic influence in the 
room somewhere. That was me, 
of course, but I was too busy 
with the redhead to notice. 

Anyway, Mrs. Somebody 
wanted to make contact with 
her paternal grandmother, Lucy, 
from the beyond. The medium 
went into his act. He concentrated and sweated and suddenly 
something began to take form in 
the room. The best way to describe it in not-world language 
is a white, shapeless cascade of 
light. 

Mrs. Somebody reared to her 
feet and screeched, "Grandma 
Lucy!" Then I really took notice.

Blgftury partially across the vibration barrier. He must have 
been vibrating in the fringe area

he look mad! His zyhku was open 
and his btgrimms were down. 

Worst of all, he saw me. 
Looked right at me with an unbelievable pattern of pain, anger, 
fear and amazement in his matrix. Me and the redhead.

without it now. The day is only 
half over and I have consumed 
a quart and a half. And it is dulling all my powers as it has practically obliterated yours. I can't

I must find the formula that

quickly. 

Quickly!

Dear Joe: 

This telepathic control becomes 
more difficult every time. I must 
pick closer points of communication soon. I have nothing to 
report but failure. I bought a ton 
of equipment and went to work 
on the formula that is half complete in my instructions. Six of 
my hotel rooms were filled with 
tubes, pipes and apparatus of all 
kinds. 

I had got my mechanism as 
close to perfect as possible when 
I realized that, in my befuddled 
condition, I had set off a reaction 
that inevitably would result in 
an explosion. I had to leave there 
immediately, but I could not create suspicion. The management 
was not aware of the nature of 
my activities. 

I moved swiftly. I could not 



afford time to bring my baggage. 
I stuffed as much money into my 
pockets as I could and then sauntered into the hotel lobby. Assuming my most casual air, I told the 
manager I was checking out. 
Naturally he was stunned since T 
was his best customer. 

"But why, sir?" he asked plaintively. 

I was baffled. What could I tell 
him? 

"Don't you like the rooms?" 
he persisted. "Isn't the service 
good?" 

"It's the rooms," I told. him. 
"They're — they're — " 

"They're what?" he wanted to 
know. 

"They're not safe." 

"Not safe? But that is ridiculous. This hotel is . . ." 

At this point the blast came. 
My nerves were a wreck from 
the alcohol. 

"See?" I screamed. "Not safe. 
I knew they were going to blow 
up!" 

He stood paralyzed as I ran 
from the lobby. Oh, well, never 
say die. Another day, another hotel. I swear I'm even beginning 
to think like the not-men, curse 
them.

Dear Joe: 

I have it! It is done! In spite 



A GLEEB FOR EARTH 



105 



of the alcohol, in spite of Blgftury's niggling criticism, I have 
succeeded. I now have developed 
a form of mold, somewhat similar 
to the antibiotics of this world, 
that, transmitted to the human 
organism, will cause a disease 
whose end will be swift and fatal. 

First the brain will dissolve and 
then the body will fall apart. 
Nothing in this world can stop 
the spread of it once it is loose. 
Absolutely nothing. 

We must use care. Stock in as 
much gin as you are able. I will 
bring with me all that I can. 
Meanwhile I must return to my 
original place of birth into this 
world of horrors. There I will 
secure the gateway, a large mirror, the vibrational point at 
which we shall meet and slowly 
climb the frequency scale to 
emerge into our own beautiful, 
now secure world. You and I together, Joe, conquerors, liberators. 

You say you eat little and drink 



as much as you - can. The same 
with me. Even in this revolting 
world I am a sad sight. My notworld senses falter. This is the 
last letter. Tomorrow I come 
with the gateway. When the gin 
is gone, we will plant the mold in 
the hotel where you live. 

In only a single gleeb it will 
begin to work. The men of this 
queer world will be no more. But 
we can't say we didn't have some 
fun, can we, Joe? 

And just let Blgftury make one 
crack. Just one xyzprlt. I'll have 
hgutry before the ghjdksla!

Dear Editor:

NOT FIT 
FOR CHILDREN 



By EVELYN E. SMITH 

Trading with the natives was 
like taking candy from a kid 
—but which were the natives? 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



PPON lowered himself hastily to the orlop and ran 
toward me. "Hurry up, 
Qan!" he projected on a sublevel, trying to escape my mother's consciousness. "They're 
coming! All the others are up already." 

"Who's coming?" my mother 



wanted to know, but her full interest was absorbed by her work, 
and she gave us only the side of 
her mind. "You youngsters really 
must learn to think clearly." 

"Yes'm." Ppon projected suitable youthful embarrassment, but 
on a lower level he was giggling. 
Later I must give him another 



108 




 



warning; we young ones could 
not yet separate the thought 
channels efficiently, so it was 
more expedient not to try. 

"The zkuchi are coming," I lied 
glibly, knowing that the old ones 
accept inanity as merely a sign 
of immaturity, "on hundreds of 
golden wings that beat faster than 
light." 

Grandfather removed a part of 
his mind from his beloved work. 
"The zkuchi are purely mythological creatures," he thought 
crossly. "You're old enough to 
know better than that . . . Qana," 
he appealed to my mother, "why 
do you let him believe in such 
nonsense?" 

"The zkuchi are part of our 
cultural heritage, Father," she 
projected gently. "We must not 
let the young ones forget our heritage. Particularly if we are to be 
here for some time." 

"It seems to me you're unnecessarily pessimistic," he complained. "You know I've never 
failed you yet. We shall get back, 
I promise you. It's just that the 
transmutation takes time." 

"But it's taken such a long time 
already," she thought sadly. 
"Sometimes I begin to have 
doubts." Then she apparently remembered that serious matters 
should not be discussed before us 
young ones. As if we didn't know 
what was going on. "Run along 
and play, children," she advised, 



"but don't forget to check the atmosphere first." 

Grandfather started to excogitate something about how it 
would be better if Ppon went and 
helped his father while I stayed 
and did my lessons — you never 
seem to escape from lessons anywhere in the Universe — but we 
got away before he could finish. 

rpOPSIDE, the others were 
jumping up and down in their 
excitement. Ztul, the half-wit, 
was so upset he actually spoke: 
"Hurry, Qan, the tourists are 
coming!" 

"Ztul, you must never, never 
make words aloud!" I thought 
fiercely. "The old ones might hear 
and find out about the game." 

"It's a harmless game," Ppon 
contributed. "And useful, too. 
Your grandfather needs the 
stuff." 

"Yes," I agreed, "but perhaps 
the old ones wouldn't see it that 
way. They might even stop the 
game. Adults have funny ideas, 
and there's no use asking for trouble." 

There was a chorus of assenting thought from the others. All 
of us had our family troubles. 

We got to work. Quickly we 
arranged the interiors of the shelters which we had cleverly built 
out of materials borrowed from 
below when the old ones' perceptions were directed elsewhere. The 



NOT FIT FOR CHILDREN 



109 



essential structure of the materials had not been changed and 
could easily be replaced when the 
time came, but there was no use 
having to give involved explanations. The old ones never seemed 
to understand anything. 

At first We had just built the 
shelters as play huts, but when 
the first tourists had misunderstood, we had improved upon the 
original misconception. Now we 
had a regular street full of rude 
dwellings. Lucky for us the old 
ones never came topside. 

As the little spaceship landed, 
Ppon and I and four of the others 
were ready at its door to form a 
welcoming committee. The rest 
dispersed to play villagers. The 
others took turns alternating the 
two roles, but I, of course, was 
always leader. After all, I'd made 
up the game. 

Two members of the crew 
dropped lightly out of the ship 
and slid a ramp into place. Then 
the passengers — there was a sizable group this time, I noted with 
satisfaction — came, followed by 
Sam, the guide, a grizzled old human. He grinned at us. We were 
old friends, for he'd been leading 
these tours for ten of their Earth 
years. 

The passengers stopped at the 
foot of the ramp and Sam ran 
forward to face them. By now we 
were used to the appearance of 
the human beings — small, binoc


ular, with smooth, pasty skins — 
although they had really frightened us when we first laid eyes 
on them. 

"TVTOW, you see, folks," Sam 
^ bellowed through his megaphone, "the scientists don't know 
everything. They said life could 
not exist out here in the Asteroid 
Belt — and, behold, life! They said 
these little planets were too small, 
had too little gravity to hold an 
atmosphere. But you just breathe 
in that air, as pure and fresh and 
clean as the atmosphere of our 
own Earth! Speaking of gravity, 
you'll notice that we're walking, 
not. floating. Matter of fact, you'll 
notice it's even a little hard to 
walk; you seem a bit heavier than 
at home. And they said there 
would be hardly any gravity. No, 
folks, those scientists know a lot 
of things, I won't deny that, but 
they sure don't know everything." 

"Amazing!" a small, bespectacled male passenger said. "I 
can hardly believe my own 
senses!" 

"Watch out for him," Ppon 
projected to me. "I think he's a 
scientist of some kind." 

"Don't teach your ancestor to 
levitate," I conceptualized back. 

Of course what struck the passengers first was neither the atmosphere nor the gravity; it was 
us. They never failed to be sur


110 




 



prised, although the travel folders should have shown them what 
to expect. One of the folders had 
a picture of me, amusingly crude 
and two-dimensional, it's true, 
but not entirely unflattering. I'm 
not really purple, just a sort of 
tender fuchsia, but what could 
you expect from the rudimentary 
color processes they used? Sam 
had let me have the original and 
I always wished I could show it 
to Mother, but I couldn't without 
having to explain where it had 
come from. 

"They're so cute!" a thin female screamed. "Almost like big 
squirrels, really, except for all 
those arms." Her teeth protruded 
more than those of the small rodent she was thinking about, or 
than mine, for that matter. 

"Be careful, ma'am," the guide 
warned her. "They speak English." 

"They do? How clever of them. 
Why, they must be quite intelligent, then." 

"They are of a pretty. high order of intelligence," the guide 
agreed, "although their methods 
of reasoning have always baffled 
scientists. Somehow they seem to 
sense scientists, think of them as 
their enemies, and just clam up 
entirely." 

"I think they're just simply too 
cute," she said, gazing at me 
fondly. 

"Ah, srrk yourself, madam," I 



excogitated, confident that humans were non-telepathic. 

CHE looked a little disturbed, 
^ though; I'd better watch myself. After all, as leader I had to 
set a good example. 

"This here is Qan," the guide 
introduced me. "Headman or 
chief or something of the tribe. 
He is always on hand to greet us." 

"Welcome, travelers from a distant star," I intoned, wrapping my mother's second-best 
cloak more impressively about 
me, "to the humble land of the 
Gchi. Come in peace, go in 
peace." 

"Why, he speaks excellent 
English," the scientist exclaimed. 

"They pick up things very 
fast," Sam explained. 

"Natives can be very, very 
shrewd," a stout female commented, clutching her handbag 
tightly. 

"And now," Sam said, "we will 
visit the rude dwellings of this 
simple, primitive, but hospitable 
people." 

"People!" Ppon projected. 
"You better mind your language, 
Buster! People, indeed!" 

"Our friend Qan will lead the 
way." Sam waved toward me. 

I smiled back at him, but didn't 
move. 

"Whatsa matter?" he hissed. 
"Don't you trust me? Your old 
pal Sam?"

111 



"No," I whispered back. "Last 
time I let you pay me at the end 
of the tour, the take was $3.75 
short." 

He tried another tack. "But 
look, Qan, it's a hell of a job 
getting all those coins together. 
Why can't you take paper money 
instead?" 

"What good would paper 
money do me up here?" 

"What I can't figure out is 
what good the metal does you up 
here, either." 

I beamed. "We eat it." 

Muttering to himself, he walked over to the ship and called 
one of the crewmen. They dragged a bag out of the ship's hold. 
Puffing, they laid it at my feet. 
I tossed it to Ztul. 

"Count it," I ordered out loud, 
"and if there's any missing, no 
one leaves this planet alive." I 
snarled ferociously. 

Everybody laughed. It was part 
of the act. 

"You will notice," Sam announced as we led the way down 
the street, "that the Gchi are all 
about the same size. No young 
ones among them. We don't know 
whether this is because they reproduce differently from us, or 
because they have concealed their 
offspring." 

"The children must be dear little creatures," the toothy female 
gushed. "If even the adults are 
cute when they're seven or eight 



feet tall, the little ones must be 
simply precious . . . Tell me, 
Chief, do you have any children?" 

"Don't understand," I grunted. 
"Concept unfamiliar. Not know 
what children is." 

"Funny," remarked the scientist, "he was speaking perfectly 
good English before." 

"Watch yourself, kid," Ppon 
ideated warningly to me. 

"Children are . . ." she began 
and stopped. "They're — well, how 
do you reproduce?" 

P>PON, the oos/i-head, took it 
upon himself to answer. "If 
you'll just step into my hut, madam, I'll be delighted to show 
you." 

"If you ask me," the scientist 
stated, "these are frauds." 

"Whaddya mean frauds?" Sam 
demanded indignantly. 

"Human beings dressed up as 
extraterrestrials. They speak too 
good an English. Their concepts 
are too .much like ours. Their 
sense of humor is equally vul — 
too similar." 

"You and your big mouth!" I 
projected to Ppon. 

"Look who's thinking!" he excogitated back. I could see I'd 
have to give him a mind-lashing 
later. 

It was up to me to save the 
situation. "If you would like to 
examine me more closely, sir," I 



112 




 




NOT FIT FOR 



CHILDREN 



113 



addressed the scientist, "you will 
see that I am not a human being. 

He approached me dubiously. 

"Closer," I said, looking him in 
the eye, as I bared my teeth and 
growled. "I have five eyes, sir, 
and you will notice that I am 
looking at you with each one of 
them. I have seven arms, sir — '■' 
here I reached out to grab him 
" — and you will notice that they 
are all living tissue." 

"No, you couldn't be a human 
being," he agreed, backing away 
as soon as I released my grip, 
"but the whole thing is . . . odd. 
Very odd." 

"If anthropologists on Earth 
can't explain all the customs of 
the primitives there," Sam tried 
to placate him, "how can we explain the behavior of extraterrestrials? Let's go into some of the 
houses. The chief has kindly 
given us his permission to look 
around." 

"Our houses are your houses," 
I stated, bowing graciously. 

As always, the tourists grew 
extremely enthusiastic about the 
furniture in our simple dwellings. 
"What lovely — er — things you 
have," squirrel-tooth commented. 
"What are they used for?" 

"Well, the pryu is for the 
mrach, of course," I explained 
glibly, "and the wrooov is much 
used for cvrking the budz, although the ywrl is preferred by 



the less discriminating. 

"Oh," she said. "How I should 
love to have one of the — 'wroov' 
I think it was you said, for my 
very own. I wonder whether . . ." 

By a curious coincidence, Hsoj 
arrived at this point, carrying a 
tray full of things and stuff. 

"Artifacts!" he shouted. "Nice 
artifacts! Who wants to buy artifacts?" 

A LL the tourists did. They 
were pretty good artifacts, if 
I do say so myself. I'd made them 
out of the junk I rescued from 
our dustbins before the disintegration unit got to work. Honestly, I can't understand how the 
old ones can complain about our 
being wasteful and then go and 
throw away all sorts of perfectly 
useful things. 

"You must pay the natives in 
metal," the guide explained. 
"They accept only coins." 

"Why?" the stout female 
wanted to know. "Do they^ really 
eat metal?" 

"I doubt it. One of them ate a 
couple of pounds of Earth candy 
a tourist gave him last time and 
he seemed to enjoy it without ill 
effects." 

"Without ill effects!" Ppon excogitated. "You should have seen 
Ztul afterward, boy!" 

"Look, Mac." A short fat human offered Hsoj a small silver 
coin and then five larger brown 



114 




 



ones. "Which would you rather 
have?" 

"Them." Hsoj pointed unhesitatingly to the brown coins. 

A smile rippled covertly 
through the tourists. 

"They're a simple and childlike people, but really so goodnatured," Sam footnoted. 

All of us gave simple goodnatured smiles as Hsoj accepted 
the gift of the brown coins. 

"Keep up the good work," I 
projected. "We can use all the 
copper we can get." 

"You like metal, dear?" a female asked Hsoj. She unfastened 
a belt from around her waist. 
"Would you take this in exchange for some of your pretty 
things?" 

"Say 'y e s.' " I conceptualized. 
"That's steel. Old and worthless 
to her, but not to us." 

"I know, I know," Hsoj ideated 
impatiently. "What makes you 
think you're the only one who 
knows anything?" 

Never had we got such a big 
haul before, because everybody 
seemed to have all sorts of metal 
stuff on him that he valued less 
than coins. 

Now came the sad part of the 
spiel. "Remember, folks, these 
simple, honest individuals you 
see before you are but the scanty 
remnants of a once-proud race 
who spanned the skies. For their 
ancestors must have been godlike

indeed to have erected such edifices as that commanding structure over there." Sam pointed to 
the portable atmosphere machine 
which was set up several yebil 
away to give our playground 
proper air. "Once glorious, now 
fallen into ruin and decay." 

"You're going to catch muh 
from the old ones," Ppon ideated, 
"when they find out you haven't 
been keeping the machine clean." 

"Don't be a silly oosh," I 
thought back with a mental grin. 
"I'm using the atmosphere machine to create atmosphere." 

"You're getting to be as stupid 
as a human," he thought in disgust. 

"May we go inside?" the scientific passenger asked Sam. 

"No, indeed," I said hastily. 
"It is our temple, sacred to the 
gods. No unbeliever may set foot 
in it." 

"What are the basic tenets of 
your religion?" the scientist wanted to know. 

"We do not talk about it," I 
said with dignity. "It is tabu. 
Bad form." 

" A ND now," announced the 
guide, glancing at his watch, 
"we have just time for the war 
dance before we leave for Vesta." 

"Against whom are they planning a war?" asked a small passenger, turning pale. 

"It's a vestigial ritual," Sam 

115 



explained quickly, "dating back 
to the days when there were other 
— er — when there was somebody 
to fight. Just an invocation to the 
gods . . . general stuff like that 
. . . nothing to be afraid of. Isn't 
it so, Qan?" 

"Quite so," I replied, folding 
all my arms across my mother's 
cloak. "Come in peace, go in 
peace. Our motto." 

We started the dance. It wouldn't have got us a passing mark 
in first grade, where we'd learned 
it rffi ago, but our version of the 
dance of the zkuchi was plenty 
good enough for the tourists. 

"If I ever visit Earth, Janna 
forbid," I thought to Ppon as we 
executed an intricate caracole, 
"I'm going to wear earplugs all 
the time." 

The dance finished. 

"Now everybody get together!" 
Sam shouted, clapping his hands 
to round up his charges. "We are 
about to leave little Gchik." 

"He should only know what 
gchik means," Ppon sniggered 
mentally. 

"Little Gchik is barren, dying, 
its past glories all but forgotten," 
Sam almost sobbed, "but still its 
simple, warm-hearted inhabitants 
carry on bravely . . ." 

"Couldn't we do something for 
them?" suggested the stout female. 

Everybody murmured assent. 
This contingency arose all too 



often — a result of our being just 
too lovable. 

"No one can help us," I said in 
a deep voice, pulling the cloak 
over my face. The idzik feathers 
trimming it tickled like crazy. 
"We must dree our own weird 
alone. Besides, the air of Gchik 
has a deleterious effect upon human beings if they're exposed to 
it for longer than four hours." 

There was a mad scramble to 
reach the ship. 

"Stand by the atmosphere machine, Hsoj," I instructed, "to 
poison a little air in case anybody wants to take a sample." 

The scientist actually did, in 
a little bottle he seemed to have 
brought along for the purpose; 
but he got off, the "asteroid" as 
rapidly as the rest of them, after 
that. 

We watched the spaceship 
dwindle to a silver mote in the 
distance. 

"Whew," Ppon thought, sinking to the surface. "That war 
dance sure takes a lot out of a 
fellow." 

'T^HEN he conceptualized indignantly as he — as well as 
the rest of us — floated off the top 
level. "Somebody's cut the gravity!" 

"Must be Grandfather," I mentalized. "I suppose he thinks 
we've been out long enough, so 
he's warning us, just as if we 



116 




 



were a bunch of infants. I guess 
we'd better go inside, though. 
Let's not forget to turn off the 
atmosphere, fellows. It uses too 
much energy and the old ones 
won't let us play topside any 
more." 

"You know everything, don't 
you, Qan?" Ppon sneered. 

I ignored him. "Pretty good 
haul," I excogitated as I hefted 
the bags of metal. "Here, Ztul, 
catch!" 

"You always make me carry 
everything!" he complained. 

Grandfather caught us as we 
lowered ourselves from the airlock. I figured he must have been 
getting suspicious or otherwise 
he'd never have left his beloved 
engines. 

"What's this you youngsters 
have?" he wanted to know, 
pouncing on our bags. "Metal, 
eh? I suppose you were going to 
make another fake meteorite out 
of it for me, were you?" 

"I thought you wanted metal, 
Grandfather," I sulked. He could 
have .been more appreciative. 

"Certainly I want metal. You 
know I need it to get the drive 
working again. But what I want 
to know is where you got it from. 
I'd think you stole it, but how 
could even little muhli like you 
steal out here in space?" 

"They have always brought 
you metal from time to time, 
Father," Mother projected, com


ing out as she overthought us. 
"So clever of them, I always 
thought." 

"Yes, but I've been thinking 
that their encountering so many 
meteorites was a singularly curious coincidence. And they were 
curious meteorites, too. I suppose 
the young ones made them themselves." 

"But out of what, Father? You 
know we don't have any spare 
metal on the ship. That's why 
you haven't been able to get the 
repairs finished before. Where 
else could they get the metal but 
from meteorites?" 

"I don't know where they get 
their metal from, but certainly 
not from meteorites. These pieces 
here are artifacts. Look, the metal 
has been more or less refined and 
roughly formed into shapes with 
crude designs upon them. Tell 
me the truth, Qan, where did you 
get these?" 

"Some people gave them to us," 
I replied sullenly. 

"People?" asked my mother. 
"What are people?" 

"Natives of this solar system. 
They call themselves people." 

"Nonsense!" my grandfather 
interjected. "It's just another one 
of your fantasies. You know what 
the astronomers say — none of the 
planets of this little system is capable of supporting life." 

"They come from the third 
planet," I persisted, trying to 



NOT FIT FOR CHILDREN

keep from disgracing myself by 
fllwng in front of the other young 
ones. "There is life there. All of 
us have seen them. Besides, there 
is the metal." 

My companions chorused 
agreement. 

"You see, Father," my mother 
smiled, stroking my head with 
three hands, "the wise ones are 
not always right." 

1%/IY grandfather nodded his 
-L" head slowly. "It is not impossible, I suppose. I hope it is 
true that these — people gave you 
and your friends the metal, Qan." 

"Oh, yes, Grandfather," I 
thought anxiously. "Of their own 
free will." 

"Well — " he continued, not altogether convinced — "this lot 
should be enough to repair the 
engines. Perhaps, when we take 
off, we should have a look at the 
youngsters' third planet on the 
way home." 

"But this trip has taken such a 
long time already, Father," my 
mother protested. "Almost a rff; 
the young ones have missed nearly two semesters of school. And 
Qan has been getting some very 
peculiar ideas — from those 
people, I suppose." 

"But if there is some sort 
of intelligent life," Grandfather 
thought, "it's our duty to visit it. 
Next time we need to stop the 
ship for repairs, it might be more 



convenient to put in at this third 
planet instead of just hanging out 
there in space. And the young 
ones say the natives seem to be 
friendly." 

"I'd like to see Sam's face 
when he comes back and finds 
his 'asteroid' gone," I conceptualized. 

"Yes," Ppon agreed, with the 
edge of his mind, but his main 
channel was turned in another 
direction. "That is the end of this 
game now, you know. In the next 
game / shall be leader." 

"Oh, yes?" I thought back. 
"I'm the leader and I'm staying 
leader, because I am the biggest 
and cleverest." 

"Children!" my mother protested, distressed. "I'm afraid 
you've picked up some really 
unpleasant concepts from those 
dreadful natives." 

"Come, come, Qana," Grandfather ideated, "we mustn't be 
intolerant." 

"Perhaps not," she replied with 
heat, "and I know the natives 
probably don't know any better, 
but I am not going to have my 
young one or anyone else's contaminated. Visit the third planet 
if you wish, but not this time. 
You'll have to make a special 
trip for it. I'm not going to let 
you stop off there while the 
young ones are aboard. It's obviously no fit place for children."

GALAXY'S 

5 Star Shelf 



JUDGMENT NIGHT by C. L. 
Moore. Gnome Press, New York, 
1952. 344 pages, $3.50. 

TTERE are five novelets by 
Catherine Moore, wife of 
Henry Kuttner and a first-rate 
writer in her own right. I enjoyed all the stories except one, 
and even that, a space opera 
called "Paradise Street," is superior to most of its breed. 

But the other four are very 
good indeed. "Judgment Night," 
nearly novel-length, is a gaudy, 
somewhat overrich science-fantasy in the grand tradition. There 
is a galactic empress whose regime is attacked from without 



and within; the narrative of her 
struggle — and her loves — is highly 
satisfying. 

"Promised Land" deals with 
some of the possible methods 
that will have to be developed to 
enable men to live far from the 
Sun — on Ganymede, in this instance. The plot weaves about the 
machinations of the boss of the 
satellite, a monster in body — and 
in mind. 

"The Code" describes what 
might happen if one could reverse time in a human being and 
start him back toward babyhood. 
Instead of becoming a baby, he 
becomes a complete alien, an emigrant to another dimension.

"Heir Apparent" tells of "integrator teams" that, by combining 
the powers of several specialized 
minds into one powerful instrument, are able to keep an overcomplex civilization going. 

A rich collection, indeed — 
varied, imagination - stretching, 
written without cheapness or 
shallowness. I don't think you 
should miss this one. 

THE NEXT MILLION YEARS 
by Charles Galton Darwin. 
Doubleday & Co., New York, 
1952. 210 pages, $2.75 

rriHIS regrettable little book 
sets before us the old argument of the eugenicists that the 
breed is deteriorating because the 
"top brains" are not reproducing 
themselves. 

Charles Darwin's elderly grandson is also Francis Galton's godson, and Galton was one of the 
founders of eugenics theories. 
The present author has forgotten 
nothing his tutor taught him 
about the inherent superiority of 
the successful and the poor breeding material of the masses. 

The book also touches upon 
the worldwide wastage of our 
natural resources, and the inevitable power famine that will result 
in a few centuries. He believes 
solar energy will be the solution. Atomic energy from nonradio-active sources? Sir Charles 



doesn't give it a thought. 

Not once is space travel even 
mentioned! The physical and psychological evolution of the race in 
1,000,000 years is inevitable, yet 
the author blandly ignores it. 

As a prediction, the book is 
practically outdated right now. 
Worse still, it's dull reading, as 
pedestrian as a bicyclist with a 
flat tire — traveling backward on 
a jet highway to the future. 

LIMBO by Bernard Wolfe. Random House, New York, 1952. 438 
pages, $3.50 

T I ''HIS is an exasperating, overwritten, confused, revolting 
and fascinating book. It shocks, 
disgusts, terrifies and not infrequently bores. It is as enormous 
— and enormously messy — as our 
own situation as human beings 
let loose amid the destroying 
machines of our own creation. 

It contains some of the most 
pretentious writing in the history 
of the novel — and some of the 
most biting and important satire. 

Voluntary amputation and replacement of limbs with atompowered prosthetics creates a new 
elite in this future world — an elite 
in which women (who are not 
permitted the honor of amputation) become the active lovers 
and the preservers of the race. 
The theory behind the vol-amps, 
as they are called, is that they 



120 




 



cannot carry on war, and that 
thus they create permanent peace. 
Hmmm! 

The time is around 1980, after 
World War III. There is "Union" 
(the remains of Soviet Eurasia) 
and "Strip" (a section of the 
U.S.A. including Denver to the 
Mississippi and little more). 
There is the inevitable conflict 
between them — temporarily sublimated in athletic contests among 
teams of the vol-amps. There 
are widespread pre-frontal lobotomies to remove aggressions; 
flaming sexuality; super-atombombing; and endless juvenile attempts at mature philosophy. 

Here are some of the men 
whose ideas and systems Wolfe 
has cannibalized to give the book 
an appearance of superior intellectual satire : 

William James, whose Moral 
Equivalent of War becomes the 
basis of much vol-amp political 
jargon; Norbert Wiener, whose 
cypernetics theories }aid the 
foundation for the astonishing 
atom -powered arms and legs of 
the vol-amps; Korzybsky (semantics) ; Burnham (the managerial society) ; Koestler (Yogis 
and Commissars); Hubbard (dianetics); Wilhelm Reich (orgone 
boxes) ; Morgenstern (and his 
theory of games, out of which 
came EMSIAC, the computer 
that ran World War III with no 
help from people) ; Claude Shan


non; Thomas Mann; Andre Gide; 
Dostoyevsky (and his ghastly 
Notes from the Underground) ; 
and Marx and Darwin and Descartes and Freud — Freud, in a 
way, is the helpless master of the 
whole crazy puppet show. 

The style is really incredible. 
There are innumerable puns, good 
and bad; slashing wit; dull 
stretches which somehow you 
don't dare skip because something good may be buried there; 
vomit; orgasms; rape (of male by 
female!) and so on and so on; 
and finally World War IV, and 
only the Lord knows what after 
that. 

Once you get past the first 60 
pages, which are boring but important, you find yourself caught 
up in this impossible-to-describe 
anti -Utopia and you can't quit. 
It's got you; and before you're 
done, you really have been pulled 
through a knothole; you're bleeding, bludgeoned, bewildered — and 
hypnotized. 

I suppose it's actually a bad 
book; most of the conventional 
reviewers seem to think so. However, it is also a book for the 
bitter present, a book carrying 
harsh warnings of a more horrifying future. 

Incidentally, it is NOT for children ! Whether it is for you or not 
is a matter you must decide for 
yourself. I liked it as much as I 
detested it.

CURRENTS OF SPACE by 
Isaac Asimov. Doubleday & Co., 
New York, 1952. 217 pages, $2,275 

A SIMOV here tells of a minor 
episode in the history of the 
Trantor Empire, so brilliantly 
pictured in the Foundation series. 

A "psycho-probed" "spatioanalyst" (one of those newfangled scientists of tomorrow) 
has learned that the planet 
Fiorina, source of the miracle 
textile "kyrt," is about to be 
destroyed when its sun goes nova. 
The scientist is put out of commission to keep the fact from 
being known. The book tells how 
this attempt by the master-race 
of Sarkians who had enslaved the 
Florinians to foil the evacuation 
of the threatened planet was defeated, and the Florinians themselves were given their freedom. 

One of Asimov's lesser efforts, 
but still considerably above the 
average space opera. 

THE LEGION OF TIME by 
Jack Williamson. Fantasy Press, 
Reading, Pa., 1952. 252 pages, 
$3.00 



TTERE are two traditional little 
space-time novelets from the 
adolescence of science fiction. 
Though now strictly for kids, they 
are naively effective despite the 
painful awkwardness of the writing. 

The title story perfectly exemplifies a 17 -year-old's wish-fancies. Denny Lanning is "thinking 
about time." This makes it 
possible for "Lethonee" (perfect 
name for a dream girl!) to appear 
before him from another spacetime world and tell him that the 
future of both his and her world 
depends on him — his ability to 
defeat "the evil flower of the 
Gyronchi." To find how he does 
it, read the book and enjoy a 
return to the youth of your 
literacy. 

"After World's End" is more 
of the same, only a bit bloodier; 
both the hero and the heroine die, 
believing they will meet after 
death. They have been to the end 
of Earth's time together, suffered 
all sorts of horrors, and finally 
expire in a mysterious blaze of 
glory that I couldn't quite figure 
out.

JUNKYARD 

By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 

Illustrated by SIBLEY 

One thing this planet could not be accused 
of was lack of hospitality. Anytime it had 
company, it wanted them to stay — for good! 



I — but they didn't know a thing, 

not a single thing, for certain. 
HEY had solved the mys- That wasn't the way a planetary 
tery — with a guess, a very survey team usually did a job.

wrung a lot of information out 
of it and could parade an impressive roll of facts. But here there 
was no actual, concrete fact beyond the one that would have 
been obvious to a twelve-yearold child. 

Commander Ira Warren was 
worried about it. He said as much 
to Bat Ears Brady, ship's cook 
and slightly disreputable pal of 
his younger days. The two of 
them had been planet-checking 
together for more than thirty 
years. While they stood at opposite poles on the table of organization, they were able to say to 
one another things they could not 
have said to any other man 
aboard the survey ship or have 
allowed another man to say to 
them. 

"Bat Ears," said Warren, "I'm 
just a little worried." 

"You're always worried," Bat 
Ears retorted. "That's part of the 
job you have." 

"This junkyard business . . ." 

"You wanted to get ahead," 
said Bat Ears, "and I told you 
what would happen. I warned 
you you'd get yourself weighed 
down with worry and authority 
and pomp — pomp — " 

"Pomposity?" 

"That's the word," said Bat 
Ears. "That's the word, exactly." 

"I'm not pompous, Warren 
contradicted. 

"No, you're worried about this 



junkyard business. I got a bottle 
stowed away. How about a little 
drink?" 

WARREN waved away the 
thought. "Someday I'll bust 
you wide open. Where you hide 
the stuff, I don't know, but every 
trip we make . . ." 

"Now, Ira! Don't go losing 
your lousy temper." 

"Every trip we make, you carry enough dead weight of liquor 
to keep you annoyingly aglow 
for the entire cruise." 

"It's baggage," Bat Ears insisted. "A man is allowed some 
baggage weight. I don't have 
hardly nothing else. I just bring 
along my drinking." 

"Someday," said Warren savagely, "it's going to get you 
booted off- the ship about five 
light-years from nowhere." 

The threat was an old one. It 
failed to dismay Bat Ears. 

"This worrying you're doing," 
Bat Ears said, "ain't doing you 
no good." 

"But the survey team didn't do 
the job," objected Warren. "Don't 
you see what this means? For the 
first time in more than a hundred 
years of survey, we've found what 
appears to be evidence that some 
other race than Man has achieved space flight. And we don't 
know a thing about it. We should 
know. With all that junk out 
there, we'd ought to be able by 



126 




 



this time to write a book about 
it." 

Bat Ears spat in contempt. 
"You mean them scientists of 
ours." 

The way he said "scientist" 
made it a dirty word. 

"They're good," said Warren. 
"The very best there is." 

"Remember the old days, Ira?" 
asked Bat Ears. "When you was 
second looey and you used to 
come down and we'd have a drink 
together and . . ." 

"That has nothing to do with 
it." 

"We had real men in them 
days. We'd get ourselves a club 
and go hunt us up some natives 
and beat a little sense into them 
and we'd get more facts in half 
a day than these scientists, with 
all their piddling around, will get 
in a month of Sundays." 

"This is slightly different," 
Warren said. "There are no natives here." 

There wasn't, as a matter of 
fact, much of anything on this 
particular planet. It was strictly 
a low-grade affair and it wouldn't 
amount to much for another billion years. The survey, understandably, wasn't too interested 
in planets that wouldn't amount 
to much for another billion years. 

Its surface was mostly rock 
outcroppings and tumbled boulder fields. In the last half million years or so, primal plants 



had gotten started and were doing well. Mosses and lichens crept 
into the crevices and crawled 
across the rocks, but aside from 
that there seemed to be no life. 
Although, strictly speaking, you 
couldn't be positive, for no one 
had been interested in the planet. 
They hadn't looked it over and 
they ' hadn't searched for life; 
everyone had been too interested 
in the junkyard. 

They had never intended to 
land, but had circled the planet, 
making routine checks and entering routine data in the survey 
record. 

Then someone at a telescope 
had seen the junkyard and they'd 
gone down to investigate and had 
been forthrightly pitchforked into 
a maddening puzzle. 

rpHEY had called it the junkyard and that was what it was. 
Strewn about were what probably were engine parts, although 
no one was quite sure. Pollard, 
the mech engineer, had driven 
himself to the verge of frenzy trying to figure out how to put some 
of the parts together. He finally 
got three of them assembled, 
somehow, and they didn't mean 
a thing, so he tried to take them 
apart again to figure out how he'd 
done it. He couldn't get them 
apart. It was about that time that 
Pollard practically blew his top. 
The engine parts, if that was 



JUNKYARD 



127 



what they were, were scattered 
all over the place, as if someone 
or something had tossed them 
away, not caring where they fell. 
But off to one side was a pile of 
other stuff, all neatly stacked, 
and it was apparent even to the 
casual glance that this stuff must 
be a pile of supplies. 

There was what more than 
likely was food, though it was a 
rather strange kind of food (if 
that was what it was), and 
strangely fabricated bottles of 
plastic that held a poison liquid, 
and other stuff that was fabric 
and might have been clothing, 
although it gave one the shudders trying to figure out what 
sort of creatures would have worn 
that kind of clothing and bundles 
of metallic bars, held together in 
the bundles by some kind of gravitational attraction instead of 
the wires that a human would 
have used to tie them in bundles. 
And a number of other objects 
for which there were no names. 

"They should have found the 
answer," Warren said. "They've 
cracked tougher nuts than this. 
In the month we've been here, 
they should have had that engine running." 

"If it is an engine," Bat Ears 
pointed out. 

"What else could it be?" 

"You're getting so that you 
sound like them. Run into something that you can't explain and 



think up the best guess possible 
and when someone questions you, 
you ask what else it could be. 
And that ain't proof, Ira." 

"You're right, Bat Ears," Warren admitted. "It certainly isn't 
proof and that's what worries me. 
We have no doubt the junk out 
there is a spaceship engine, but 
we have no proof of it." 

"Nobody's going to land a 
ship," said Bat Ears testily, "and 
rip out the engine and just throw 
it away. If they'd done that, the 
ship would still be here." 

"But if that's not the answer," 
demanded Warren, "what is all 
that stuff out there?" 

"I wouldn't know. I'm not even 
curious. I ain't the one that's worrying." 

He got up from the chair and 
moved toward the door. 

"I still got that bottle, Ira." 

"No, thanks," Warren said. 

He sat and listened to Bat 
Ear's feet going down the stairs. 

II 

ly-ENNETH SPENCER, the 
alien psychologist, came into 
the cabin and sat down in the 
chair across the desk from Warren. 

"We're finally through," he 
said. 

"You aren't through," challenged Warren. "You haven't 
even started." 



128 




 



"We've done all we can." 

Warren grunted at him. ' 

"We've run all sorts of tests," 
said Spencer. "We've got a book 
full of analyses. We have a complete photographic record and 
everything is down on paper in 
diagrams and notes and — " 

"Then tell me: What is that 
junk out there?" 

"It's a spaceship engine." 

"If it's an engine," Warren 
said, "let's put it together. Let's 
find out how it runs. Let's figure 
out the kind of intelligence most 
likely to have built it." 

"We tried," replied Spencer. 
"All of us tried. Some of us didn't 
have applicable knowledge or 
training, but even so we worked; 
we helped the ones who had 
training." 

"I know how hard you 
worked." 

And they had worked hard, 
only snatching stolen hours to 
sleep, eating on the run. 

"We are dealing with alien mechanics," Spencer said. 

"We've dealt with other alien 
concepts," Warren reminded him. 
"Alien economics and alien religions and alien psychology . . ." 

"But this is different." 

"Not so different. Take Pollard, now. He is the key man in 
this situation. Wouldn't you have 
said that Pollard should have 
cracked it?" 

"If it can be cracked, Pollard 



is your man. He has everything — 
the theory, the experience, the 
imagination." 

"You think we should leave?" 
asked Warren. "That's what you 
came in to tell me? You think 
there is no further use of staying 
here?" 

"That's about it," Spencer admitted. 

"All right," Warren told him. 
"If you say so, I'll take your 
word for it. We'll blast off right 
after supper. I'll tell Bat Ears to 
fix us up a spread. A sort of 
achievement dinner." 

"Don't rub it in so hard," protested Spencer. "We're not proud 
of what we've done." 

Warren heaved himself out of 
the chair. 

"I'll go down and tell Mac to 
get the engines ready. On the way 
down, I'll drop in on Bat Ears 
and tell him." 

Spencer said, "I'm worried, 
Warren." 

"So am I. What is worrying 
you?" 

"Who are these things, these 
other people, who had the other 
spaceship? They're the first, you 
know, the first evidence we've 
ever run across, of another race 
that had discovered space flight. 
And what happened to them 
here?" 

"Scared?" 

"Yes. Aren't you?" 

"Not yet," said Warren. "I 



JUNKYARD 



129 



probably will be when I have the 
time to think it over." 

He went down the stairs to talk 
to Mac about the engines. 

Ill 

TTE found Mac sitting in his 
cubby hole, smoking his 
blackened pipe and reading 
his thumb-marked Bible. 

"Good news," Warren said to 
him. 

Mac laid down the book and 
took off his glasses. 

"There's but one thing you 
could tell me that would be good 
news," he said. 

"This is it. Get the engines 
ready. We'll be blasting off." 

"When, sir? Not that it can be 
too soon." 

"In a couple of hours or so," 
said Warren. "We'll eat and get 
settled in. I'll give you the word." 

The engineer folded the spectacles and slid them in his pocket. 
He tapped the pipe out in his 
hand and tossed away the ashes 
and put the dead pipe back between his teeth. 

"I've never liked this place," 
he said. 

"You never like any place." 

"I don't like them towers." 

"You're crazy, Mac. There 
aren't any towers." 

"The boys and me went walking," said the engineer. "We 
found a bunch of towers." 



"Rock formations, probably." 

"Towers," insisted the engineer doggedly. 

"If you found some towers," 
Warren demanded, "why didn't 
you report them?" 

"And have them science beagles go baying after them and 
have to stay another month?" 

"It doesn't matter," Warren 
said. "They probably aren't towers. Who would mess around 
building towers on this backwash 
of a planet?" 

"They were scary," Mac told 
him. "They had that black look 
about them. And the smell of 
death." 

"It's the Celt in you. The big, 
superstitious Celt you are, rocketing through space from world 
to world — and still believing in 
banshees and spooks. The medieval mind in the age of science." 

Mac said, "They fair give a 
man the shivers." 

They stood facing one another 
for a long moment. Then Warren put out a hand and tapped 
the other gently on the shoulder. 

"I won't say a word about 
them," he said. "Now get those 
engines rolling." 

IV 

WARREN sat in silence at the 
table's head, listening to the 
others talk. 

"It was a jury-rigged job," said 



130 




 



Clyne, the physicist. "They tore 
out a lot of stuff and rebuilt the 
engine for some reason or other 
and there was a lot of the stuff 
they tore out that they didn't use 
again. For some reason, they had 
to rebuild the engine and they 
rebuilt it simpler than it was before. Went back to basic principles and cut out the fancy stuff — 
automatics and other gadgets like 
that — but the one they rebuilt 
must have been larger and more 
unwieldy, less compact, than the 
one that they ripped down. That 
would explain why they left some 
of their supplies behind." 

"But," asked Dyer, the chemist, "what did they jury-rig it 
with? Where did they get the 
material?" 

Briggs, the metallurgist, said, 
"This place crawls with ore. If 
it wasn't so far out, it would be 
a gold mine." 

"We- saw no signs of mining," 
Dyer objected. "No signs of mining or smelting and refining or 
of fabrication." 

"We didn't go exploring," 
Clyne pointed out. "They might 
have done some mining a few 
miles away from here and we'd 
have never known it." 

Spencer said, "That's the trouble with us on this whole project. We've adopted suppositions 
and let them stand as fact. If 
they had to do some fabrication, 
it might be important to know a 



little more about it." 

"What difference does it 
make?" asked Clyne. "We know 
the basic facts — a spaceship landed here in trouble, they finally 
repaired their engines, and they 
took off once again." 

Old Doc Spears, down at the 
table's end, slammed his fork on 
his plate. 

"You don't even know," he 
said, "that it was a spaceship. 
I've listened to you caterwauling 
about this thing for weeks. I've 
never seen so damn much motion 
and so few results in all my born 
days." 

All of them looked a little surprised. Old Doc was normally a 
mild man and he usually paid 
little attention to what was going 
on, bumbling around on his regular rounds to treat a smashed 
thumb or sore throat or some 
other minor ailment. All of them 
had wondered, with a slight sickish feeling, how Old Doc might 
perform if he faced a real emergency, like major surgery, say. 
They didn't have much faith in 
him, but they liked him well 
enough. Probably they liked him 
mostly because he didn't mix into 
their affairs. 

And here he was, mixing right 
into them truculently. 

Lang, the communications 
man, said, "We found the 
scratches, Doc. You remember 
that. Scratches on the rock. The 



JUNKYARD 



131 



kind of scratches that a spaceship could have made in landing. 

"Could have made," said Doc 
derisively. 

"Must have made!" 

1~VLD Doc snorted and went on 
^-^ with his eating, holding his 
head down over the plate, napkin tucked beneath his chin, 
shoveling in the food with fork 
and knife impartially. Doc was 
noted as a messy eater. 

"I have a feeling," Spencer 
said, "that we may be off the 
beaten track in thinking of this 
as a simple repair job. From the 
amount of parts that are down 
there in the junkyard, I'd say 
that they found it necessary to 
do a redesigning job, to start from 
the beginning and build an entirely new engine to get them 
out of here. I have a feeling that 
those engine parts out there represent the whole engine, that if 
we knew how, we could put 
those parts together and we'd 
have an engine." 

"I tried it," Pollard answered. 

"I can't quite buy the idea 
that it was a complete redesigning job," Clyne stated. "That 
would mean a new approach 
and some new ideas that would 
rule out the earlier design and 
all the parts that had been built 
into the original engine as it 
stood. The theory would ex


plain why there are so many 
parts strewn around, but it's just 
not possible. You don't redesign 
an engine when you're stranded 
on a barren planet. You stick to 
what you know." 

Dyer said, "Accepting an 
idea like redesigning sends you 
back again to the problem of 
materials." 

"And tools," added Lang. 
"Where would they get the 
tools?" 

"They'd probably have a machine shop right on board the 
ship," said Spencer. 

"For minor repairs," Lang 
corrected. "Not the kind of 
equipment you would need to 
build a complete new engine." 

"What worries me," said Pollard, "is our absolute inability 
to understand any of it. I tried 
to fit those parts together, tried 
to figure out the relationship of 
the various parts — and there 
must be some sort of relationship, because unrelated parts 
would make no sense at all. Finally I was able to fit three of 
them together and that's as far 
as I could get. When I got them 
together, they didn't spell a 
thing. They simply weren't going anywhere. Even with three 
of them together, you were no 
better off, no further along in 
understanding, than before 
you'd put them together. And 
when I tried to get them apart, 



132 




 



I couldn't do that, either. You'd 
think, once a man had got a thing 
together, he could take it apart 
again, wouldn't you?" 

"It was an alien ship," Spencer 
offered, "built by alien people, 
* run by alien engines." 

"Even so," said Pollard, "there 
should have been some basic idea 
that we could recognize. In some 
way or other, their engine should 
have operated along at least one 
principle that would be basic with 
human mechanics. An engine is 
a piece of mechanism that takes 
raw power and controls it and 
directs it into useful energy. That 
would be its purpose, no matter 
what race built it." 

"The metal," said Briggs, "is 
an alien alloy, totally unlike anything we have ever run across. 
You can identify the components, 
all right, but the formula, when 
you get it down, reads like a metallic nightmare. It shouldn't 
work. By Earth standards, it 
wouldn't work. There's some secret in the combination that I 
can't even guess at." 

Old Doc said, from the table's 
end, "You're to be congratulated, 
Mr. Briggs, upon your fine sense 
of restraint." 

"Cut it out, Doc," Warren ordered sharply, speaking for the 
first time. 

"All right," said Doc. "If that's 
the way you want it, Ira, I will 
cut it out." 



V 

OTANDING outside the ship, 
^ Warren looked across the 
planet. Evening was fading into 
night and the junkyard was no 
more than a grotesque blotch of 
deeper shadow on the hillside. 

Once, not long ago, another 
ship had rested here, just a little 
way from where they rested now. 
Another ship — another race. 

And something had happened 
to that ship, something that his 
survey party had tried to ferret 
out and had fa'iled to discover. 

It had not been a simple repair 
job; he was sure of that. No matter what any of them might say, 
it had been considerably more 
than routine repair. 

There had been some sort of 
emergency, a situation with a 
strange urgency about it. They 
had left in such a hurry that they 
had abandoned some of their supplies. No commander of any 
spaceship, be he human or alien, 
would leave supplies behind except when life or death was involved in his escape. 

There was what appeared to be 
food in the stack of supplies — at 
least, Dyer had said that it was 
food, although it didn't look edible. And there were the plasticlike bottles filled with a poison 
that might be, as like as not, the 
equivalent of an alien whisky. 
And no man, Warren said, leaves 



JUNKYARD 



133 



food and whisky behind except 
in the direst emergency. 

He walked slowly down the 
trail they'd beaten between the 
ship's lock and the junkyard and 
it struck him that he walked in 
a silence that was as deep as the 
awful stillness of far space. There 
was nothing here to make any 
sound at all. There was no life 
except the mosses and the lichens 
and the other primal plants that 
crept among the rocks. In time 
there would be other life, for the 
planet had the air and water and 
the basic ingredients for soil and 
here, in another billion years or 
so, there might arise a life economy as complex as that of Earth. 

But a billion years, he thought, 
is a long, long time. 

He reached the junkyard and 
walked its familiar ground, dodging the larger pieces of machinery 
that lay all about, stumbling on 
one or two of the smaller pieces 
that lay unseen in the darkness. 

'T'HE second time he stumbled, 
he stooped and picked up the 
thing he had stumbled on and it 
was, he knew, one of the tools 
that the alien race had left behind them when they fled. He 
could picture them, dropping 
their tools and fleeing, but the 
picture was not clear. He could 
not decide what these aliens 
might have looked like or what 
they might have fled from. 



He tossed the tool up and 
down, catching it in his hand. It 
was light and handy and undoubtedly there was some use for 
it, but he did not know the use 
nor did any of the others up there 
in the ship. Hand or tentacle, 
claw or paw — what appendage 
had it been that had grasped the 
tool? What mind lay behind the 
hand or tentacle, claw or paw 
that had grasped and used it? 

He stood and threw back his 
head and looked at the stars that 
shone above the planet and they 
were not the familiar stars he had 
known when he was a child. 

Far out, he thought, far out. 
The farthest out that Man had 
ever been. 

A sound jerked him around, 
the sound of running feet coming 
down the trail. 

"Warren!" cried a voice. "Warren! Where are you?" 

There was fright in that voice, 
the frantic note of panic that one 
hears in the screaming of a terrified child. 

"Warren!" 

"Here!" shouted Warren. "Over 
here. I'm coming." 

He swung around and hurried 
to meet the man who was running in the dark. 

The runner would have charged on past him if he had not put 
out a hand and gripped him by 
the shoulder and pulled him to a 
halt. 



134 




 



"Warren! Is that you?" 

"What's the matter, Mac?" 
asked Warren. 

"I can't ... I can't . . . I . . ." 

"What's wrong? Speak up! You 
can't what, Mac?" 

He felt the engineer's fumbling 
hands reaching out for him, 
grasping at his coat lapels, hanging onto him as if the engineer 
were a drowning man. 

"Come on, come on," Warren 
urged with the impatience of 
alarm. 

"I can't start the engines, sir," 
said Mac. 

"Can't start the . . ." 

"I can't start them, sir. And 
neither can the others. None of 
us can start them, sir." 

"The engines!" said Warren, 
terror rising swiftly. "What's the 
matter with the engines?" 

"There's nothing the matter 
with the engines. It's us, sir. We 
can't start them." 

"Talk sense, man. Why can't 
you?" 

"We can't remember how. 
We've forgotten how to start the 
engines!" 

VI 

W7ARREN switched on the 
*^ light above the desk and 
straightened, seeking out the book 
among the others on the shelf. 

"It's right here, Mac," he said. 
"I knew I had it here." 



He found it and took it down 
and opened it beneath the light. 
He leafed the pages rapidly. Behind him he could hear the tense, 
almost terrified breathing of the 
engineer. 

"It's all right, Mac. It's all here 
in the book." 

He leafed too far ahead and 
had to back up a page or two and 
reached the place and spread the 
book wide beneath the lamp. 

"Now," he said, "we'll get 
those engines started. It tells right 
here . . ." 

He tried to read and couldn't. 

He could understand the words 
all right and the symbols, but 
the sum of the words he read 
made little sense and the symbols 
none at all. 

He felt the sweat breaking out 
on him, running down his forehead and gathering in his eyebrows, breaking out of his armpits 
and trickling down his ribs. 

"What's the matter, Chief?" 
asked Mac. "What's the matter 
now?" 

Warren felt his body wanting 
to shake, straining every nerve 
to tremble, but it wouldn't move. 
He was frozen stiff. 

"This is the engine manual," 
he said, his voice cold and low. 
"It tells all about the engines — 
how they operate, how to locate 
trouble, how to fix them." 

"Then we're all right," breathed Mac, enormously relieved. 



JUNKYARD 



135 



Warren closed the book. 

"No, we aren't, Mac. I've forgotten all the symbols and most 
of the terminology." 

"You what!" 

"I can't read the book," said 
Warren. 

VII 




T just isn't possible," argued 
Spencer. 



"It's not only possible," Warren told him. "It happened. Is 
there any one of you who can 
read that book?" 

They didn't answer him. 

"If there's anyone who can," 
invited Warren, "step up and 
show us how." 

Clyne said quietly, "There's 
none of us can read it." 

"And yet," declared Warren, 
"an hour ago any one of you — 
any single one of you — probably 
would have bet his life that he 
not only could start the engines 
if he had to, but could take the 
manual if he couldn't and figure 
how to do it." 

"You're right," Clyne agreed. 
"We would have bet our lives. 
An hour ago we would have. It 
would have been a safe, sure 
bet." 

"That's what you think," said 
Warren. "How do you know how 
long it's been since you couldn't 
read the manual?" 

"We don't, of course," Clyne 



was forced to admit. 

"There's something more. You 
didn't find the answer to the 
junkyard. You guessed an answer, 
but you didn't find one. And you 
should have. You know damn 
well you should have." 

Clyne rose to his feet. "Now 
see here, Warren . . ." 

"Sit down, John," said Spencer. 
"Warren's got us dead to rights. 
We didn't find an answer and we 
know we didn't. We took a guess 
and substituted it for the answer 
that we didn't find. And Warren's 
right about something else — we 
should have found the answer." 

Under any other circumstances, 
Warren thought, they might have 
hated him for those blunt truths, 
but now they didn't. They just 
sat there and he could see the 
realization seeping into them. 

Dyer finally said, "You think 
we failed out there because we 
forgot — just like Mac forgot." 

"You lost some of your skills," 
replied Warren, "some of your 
skills and knowledge. You worked as hard as ever. You went 
through the motions. You didn't 
have the skill or knowledge any 
more, that's all." 

"And now?" asked Lang. 

"I don't know." 

"This is what happened to that 
other ship," said Briggs emphatically. 

"Maybe," Warren said with 
less conviction. 



136 




 



"But they got away," Clyne 
pointed out. 

"So will we," promised Warren. "Somehow." 

VIII 

rpHE crew of that other, alien 
ship had evidently forgotten, 
too. But somehow or other they 
had blasted off — somehow or 
other they had remembered, or 
forced themselves to remember. 
But if it had been the simple matter of remembering, why had they 
rebuilt the engines? They could 
have used their own. 

Warren lay in his bunk, staring into the blackness, knowing 
that a scant two feet above his 
head there was a plate of steel, 
but he couldn't see the steel. And 
he knew there was a way to start 
the engines, a simple way once 
you knew it or remembered it, 
but he couldn't see that, either. 

Man experienced incidents, 
gathered knowledge, knew emotion — and then, in the course of 
time, forgot the incident and 
knowledge and emotion. Life was 
a long series of forgettings. Memories were wiped out and old 
knowledge dulled and skill was 
lost, but it took time to wipe it 
out or dull it or lose it. You 
couldn't know a thing one day 
and forget it on the next. 

But here on this barren world, 
in some impossible way, the for


getting had been speeded up. On 
Earth it took years to forget an 
incident or to lose a skill. Here 
it happened overnight. 

He tried to sleep and couldn't. 
He finally got up and dressed 
and went down the stairs, out 
the lock into the alien night. 

A low voice asked, "That you, 
Ira?" 

"It's me, Bat Ears. I couldn't 
sleep. I'm worried." 

"You're always worried," Bat 
Ears. "It's an occu . . . occu . . ." 

"Occupational?" 

"That's it," said Bat Ears, tficcoughing just a little. "That's the 
word I wanted. Worry is an occupational disease with you." 

"We're in a jam, Bat Ears." 

"There's been planets," Bat 
Ears said, "I wouldn't of minded 
so much being marooned on, but 
this ain't one of them. This here 
place is the tail end of creation." 

They stood together in the 
darkness with the sweep of alien 
stars above them and the silent 
planet stretching off to a vague 
horizon. 

"There's something here," Bat 
Ears went on. "You can smell it 
in the air. Them fancy-pants in 
there said there wasn't nothing 
here because they couldn't see 
nothing and the books they'd 
read said nothing much could 
live on a planet that was just 
rocks and moss. But, me, I've 
seen planets. Me, I was planet


JUNKYARD 



137 



checking when most of them was 
in diapers and my nose can tell 
me more about a planet than 
their brains all lumped together, 
which, incidentally, ain't a bad 
idea." 

"I think you're right," confessed Warren. "I can feel it myself. 
I couldn't before. Maybe it's just 
because we're scared that we can 
feel it now." 

"I felt it before I was scared." 

"We should have looked 



138 





around. That's where we made 
our mistake. But there was so 
much work to do in the junkyard 
that we never thought of it." 

"Mac took a little jaunt," said 
Bat Ears. "Says he found some 
towers." 

"He told me about them, too." 

"Mac was just a little green 
around the gills when he was telling me." 

"He told me he didn't like 
them." 



139 



"If there was any place to run 
to, Mac would be running right 
now." 

"In the morning," Warren said, 
"we'll go and see those towers." 

IX 

T^HEY were towers, all right, 
and there were eight of them 
in line, like watch towers that at 
one time had stretched across the 
planet, but something had happened and all the others had been 
leveled except the eight that were 
standing there. 

They were built of undressed 
native rock, crudely piled, without mortar and with little wedges 
and slabs of stone used in the 
interstices to make the stones set 
solid. They were the kind of towers that might have been built 
by a savage race and they had an 
ancient look about them. They 
were about six feet at the base 
and tapered slightly toward the 
top and each of them was capped 
by a huge flat stone with an enormous boulder placed upon the 
slab to hold it in its place. 

Warren said to Ellis, "This is 
your department. Take over." 

The little archeologist didn't 
answer. He walked around the 
nearest tower and went up close 
to it and examined it. He put out 
his hands and acted as if he 
meant to shake the tower, but it 
didn't shake. 



"Solid," he said. "Well built 
and old." 

"Type F culture, I jvould say," 
guessed Spencer. 

"Maybe less than that. No attempt at an esthetic effect — pure 
utility. But good craftsmanship." 

Clyne said, "Its purpose is the 
thing. What were the towers 
built for?" 

"Storage space," said Spencer. 

"A marker," Lang contradicted. "A claim marker, a cache 
marker . . ." 

"We can find the purpose," 
Warren said. "That is something 
we needn't argue nor speculate 
about. All we have to do is knock 
off the boulder and lift the cap 
and have a look inside." 

He strode up to the tower and 
started climbing it. 

It was an easy thing to climb, 
for there were niches in the stones 
and hand and toe holds were not 
too hard to find. 

He reached the top. 

"Look out below," he yelled, 
and heaved at the boulder. 

It rolled and then slowly settled back. He braced himself and 
heaved again and this time it 
toppled. It went plunging off the 
tower, smashed to the ground, 
went rumbling down the slope, 
gathering speed, hitting other 
boulders in its path, zigzagging 
with the deflection of its course, 
thrown high into the air by the 
boulders that it hit. 



140 




 



WARREN said, "Throw a 
rope up to me. I'll fasten it 
to the capstone and then we can 
haul it off." 

"We haven't got a rope," said 
Clyne. 

"Someone run back to the ship 
and get one. I'll wait here till he 
returns." 

Briggs started back toward the 
ship. 

Warren straightened up. From 
the tower he had a fine view of 
the country and he swiveled slowly, examining it. 

Somewhere nearby, he thought, 
the men — well, not men, but the 
things that built these towers — 
must have had their dwelling. 
Within a mile or so there had 
been at one time a habitation. 
For the towers would have taken 
time in building and that meant 
that the ones who built them 
must have had at least a semipermanent location. 

But there was nothing to see — 
nothing but tumbled boulder 
fields and great outcroppings and 
the blankets of primal plants 
that ran across their surfaces. 

What did they live on? Why 
were they here? What would have 
attracted them? What would 
have held them here? 

He halted in his pivoting, 
scarcely believing what he saw. 
Carefully he traced the form of 
it, making sure that the light on 
some boulder field was not be


fuddling his vision. 

It couldn't be, he told himself. 
It couldn't happen three times. 
He must be wrong. 

He sucked in his breath and 
held it and waited for the illusion to go away. 

It didn't go away. The thing 
was there. 

"Spencer," he called. "Spencer, 
please come up here." 

He continued watching it. Below him, he heard Spencer scrabbling up the tower. He reached 
down a hand and helped him. 

"Look," Warren said, pointing. 
"What is that out there?" 

"A ship!" cried Spencer. 
"There's another ship out there!" 

'T'HE spaceship was old, incredibly old. It was red with rust; 
you could put your hand against 
its metal hide and sweep your 
hand across it and the flakes of 
rust would rain down upon the 
rock and your hand would come 
away painted with rust. 

The airlock once had been 
closed, but someone or something 
had battered a hole straight 
through it without opening it, 
for the rim was still in place 
against the hull and the jagged 
hole ran to the ship's interior. 
For yards around the lock, the 
ground was red with violently 
scattered rust. 

They clambered through the 
hole. Inside, the ship was bright 



JUNKYARD 



141 



and shining, without a trace of 
rust, although there was a coating of dust over everything. 
Through the dust upon the floor 
was a beaten track and many isolated footprints where the owners 
of the prints had stepped out of 
the path. They were alien tracks, 
with a heavy heel and three 
great toes, for all the world like 
the tracks of a mighty bird or 
some long-dead dinosaur. 

The trail led through the ship 
back to the engine room and 
there the empty platform stood, 
with the engines gone. 

"That's how they got away," 
said Warren, "the ones who 
junked their engines. They took 
the engines off this ship and put 
them in their ship and then they 
took off." 

"But they wouldn't know — " 
argued Clyne. 

"They evidently did," Warren 
interrupted bluntly. 

Spencer said, "They must have 
been the ones. This ship has been 
here for a long time — the rust 
will tell you that. And it was 
closed, hermetically sealed, because there's no rust inside. That 
hole was punched through the 
lock fairly recently and the engines taken." 

"That means, then," said Lang, 
"that they did junk their engines. 
They ripped them out entire and 
heaved them in the junkpile. 
They tore them out and replaced 



them with the engines from this 
ship." 

"But why?" asked Clyne. 
"Why did they have to do it?" 

"Because," said Spencer, "they 
didn't know how to operate their 
own engines." 

"But if they didn't know how 
to operate their engines, how 
could they run this one?" 

"TTE'S got you there," said 
Dyer. "That's one' that you 
can't, answer." 

"No, I can't," shrugged Warren. "But I wish I could, because 
then we'd have the answer ourselves." 

"How long ago," asked Spencer, "would you say this ship 
landed here? How long would it 
take for a spaceship hull to rust?" 

"It's hard to tell," Slyne answered. "It would depend on the 
kind of metal they used. But you 
can bet on this — any spaceship 
hull, no matter who might have 
built it, would be the toughest 
metal the race could fabricate." 

"A thousand years?" Warren 
suggested. 

"I don't know," said Clyne. 
"Maybe a thousand years. Maybe more than that. You see this 
dust. That's what's left of whatever organic material there was 
in the ship. If the beings that 
landed here remained within the 
ship, they still are here in the 
form of dust."

Warren tried to think, tried to 
sort out the chronology of the 
whole thing. 

A thousand years ago, or thousands of years ago, a spaceship 
had landed here and had not got 
away. 

Then another spaceship landed, 
a thousand or thousands of years 
later, and it, too, was unable to 
get away. But it finally escaped 
when the crew robbed the first 
ship of its engines and substituted 
them for the ones that had 
brought it here. 

Then years, or months, or days 
later, the Earth survey ship had 
landed here and it, too, couldn't 
get away — because the men who 
ran it couldn't remember how to 
operate its engines. 

He swung around and strode 
from the engine room, leaving the 
others there, following the path in 
the dust back to the shattered 
lock. 

And just inside the port, sitting 
on the floor, making squiggles 
in the dust with an awkward 
finger, sat Briggs, who had gone 
back to the ship to get a length 
of rope. 

"Briggs," said Warren sharply. 
"Briggs, what are you doing 
here?" 

Briggs looked up with vacant, 
laughing eyes. 

"Go away," he said. 

Then he went back to making 
squiggles in the dust.

T\OC SPEARS said, "Briggs 
reverted to childhood. His 
mind is wiped as clean as a oneyear-old's. He can talk, which is 
about the only difference between 
a child and him. But his vocabulary is limited and what he says 
makes very little sense." 

"He can be taught again?" 
asked Warren. 

*'I don't know." 

"Spencer had a look at him. 
What does Spencer say?" 

"Spencer said a lot," Doc told 
him. "It adds up, substantially, 
to practically total loss of memory." 

"What can we do?" 

"Watch him. See he doesn't 
get hurt. After a while we might 
try re-education. He may even 
pick up some things by himself. 
Something happened to him. 
Whether whatever it was that 
took his memory away also injured his brain is something I 
can't say for sure. It doesn't appear injured, but without a lot of 
diagnostic equipment we don't 
have, you can't be positive." 

"There's no sign of injury?" 

"There's not a single mark 
anywhere," said Doc. "He isn't 
hurt. That is, not physically. It's 
only his mind that's been injured. 
Maybe not his mind, either — just 
his memory gone." 

"Amnesia?" 



JUNKYARD 



143 



"Not amnesia. When you have 
that, you're confused. You are 
haunted by the thought that you 
have forgotten something. You're 
all tangled up. Briggs isn't confused or tangled. He seems to be 
happy enough." 

"You'll take care of him, Doc? 
Kind of keep an eye on him?" 

Doc snorted and got up and 
left. 

Warren called after him, "If 
you see Bat Ears down there, tell 
him to come up." 

Doc clumped down the stairs. 

Warren sat and stared at the 
blank wall opposite him. 

First Mac and his crew had 
forgotten how to run the engines. 
That was the first sign of what 
was happening — the first recognizable sign — for it had been, going on long before Mac found 
he'd forgotten all his engine lore. 

The crew of investigators had 
lost some of their skills and their 
knowledge almost from the first. 
How else could one account for 
the terrible mess they'd made of 
the junkyard business? Under 
ordinary circumstances, they 
would have wrung some substantial information from the engine 
parts and the neatly stacked supplies. They had gotten information of a sort, of course, but it 
added up to nothing. Under ordinary circumstances, it should 
have added up to an extraordinary something. 



He heard feet coming up the 
stairs, but the tread was too 
crisp for Bat Ears. 

It was Spencer. 

OPENCER flopped into one of 
^ the chairs. He sat there opening and closing his hands, looking 
down at them w*ith helpless anger. 

"Well?" asked Warren. "Anything to report?" 

"Briggs got into that first tower," said Spencer. "Apparently 
he came back with the rope and 
found us gone, so he climbed up 
and threw a hitch around the capstone, then climbed down again 
and pulled it off. The capstone is 
lying on the ground, at the foot 
of the tower, with the rope still 
hitched around it." 

Warren nodded. "He could 
have done that. The capstone 
wasn't too heavy. One man could 
have pulled it off." 

"There's something in that 
tower." 

"You took a look?" 

"After what happened to 
Briggs? Of course not. I posted 
a guard to keep everyone away. 
We can't go monkeying around 
with the tower until we've 
thought a few things through." 

"What do you think is in 
there?" 

"I don't know," said Spencer. 
"All I have is an idea. We know 
what it can do. It can strip your 
memory." 



144 




 



"Maybe it's fright that did it," 
Warren said. "Something down 
in the tower so horrible . . ." 

Spencer shook his head. "There 
is no evidence of fright in Briggs. 
He's calm. Sits there happy as a 
clam, playing with his fingers 
and talking silly sentences — happy sentences. The way a kid 
would talk." 

"Maybe what he's saying will 
give us a hint. Keep someone listening all the time. Even if the 
words don't mean much . . ." 

"It wouldn't do any good. Not 
only is his memory gone, but even 
the memory of what took it 
away." 

"What do you plan to do?" 

"Try to get into the tower," 
said Spencer. "Try to find out 
what's in there. There must be a 
way of getting at whatever is 
there and coming out okay." 

"Look," Warren stated^ "we 
have enough as it is." 

"I have a hunch." 

"This is the first time I've ever 
heard you use that word. You 
gents don't operate on hunches. 
You operate on fact." 

Spencer put up an outspread 
hand and wiped it across his face. 

"I don't know what's the matter with me, Warren. I know I've 
never thought in hunches before. 
Perhaps because now I can't help 
myself, the hunch comes in and 
fills the place of knowledge that 
I've lost." 



"You admit there's been knowledge lost?" 

"Of course I do," said Spencer. 
"You were right about the junkyard. We should have done a 
better job." 

"And now you have a hunch." 

"TT'S crazy," said Spencer. "At 
least, it sounds crazy. That 
memory, that lost knowledge and 
lost skill went somewhere. Maybe 
there's something in the tower 
that took it away. I have the silly 
feeling we might get it back again, 
take it back from the thing that 
has it." 

He looked challengingly at 
Warren. "You think I'm cracked." 

Warren shook his head. "No, 
not that. Just grasping at straws." 

Spencer got up heavily. "I'll do 
what I can. I'll talk with the 
others. We'll try to think it out 
before we try anything." 

When he had gone, Warren 
buzzed the engine room communicator. 

Mac's voice came reedily out 
of the box. 

"Having any luck, Mac?" 

"None at all," Mac told him. 
"We sit and look at the engines. 
We are going out of our heads 
trying to remember." 

"I guess that's all you can do, 
Mac." 

"We could mess around with 
them, but I'm afraid if we do, 
we'll get something out of kilter." 



JUNKYARD 



145 



"Keep your hands off everything," commanded Warren in 
sudden alarm. "Don't touch a 
single thing. God knows what 
you might do." 

"We're just sitting," Mac said, 
"and looking at the engines and 
trying to remember." 

Crazy, thought Warren. 

Of course it was crazy. 

Down there were men trained to 
operate spaceship engines, men 
who had lived and slept with 
engines for year on lonesome year. 
And now they sat and looked at 
engines and wondered how to 
run them. 

Warren got up from his desk 
and went slowly down the stairs. 

In the cook's quarters, he 
found Bat Ears. 

Bat Ears had fallen off a chair 
and was fast asleep upon the 
floor, breathing heavily. The room 
reeked with liquor fumes. An almost empty bottle sat upon the 
table. 

Warren reached out a foot and 
prodded Bat Ears gently. Bat 
Ears moaned a little in his sleep. 

Warren picked up the bottle 
and held it to the light. There 
was one good, long drink. 

He tilted the bottle and took 
the drink, then hurled the empty 
bottle against the wall. The broken plastiglass sprayed in a 
shower down on Bat Ears' head. 

Bat Ears raised a hand and 
brushed it off, as if brushing 



away a fly. Then he slept on, 
smiling, with his mind comfortably drugged against memories 
he no longer had. 

XII 

'T'HEY covered the tower with 
the capstone once again and 
rigged a tripod and pulley above 
it. Then they took the capstone 
off and used the pulley to lower 
an automatic camera into the pit 
and they got their pictures. 

There was something in the 
tower, all right. 

They spread the pictures out 
on the table in the mess room 
and tried to make out what they 
had. 

It was shaped like a watermelon or an egg " stood on one end 
with the lower end slightly mashed so that it would stand upright. 
It sprouted tiny hairs all over 
and some of the hairs were blurred in the pictures, as if they 
might have been vibrating. There 
was tubing and what seemed to 
be wiring, even if it didn't look 
exactly the way you thought of 
wiring, massed around the lower 
end of the egg. 

They made other tests, lowering the instruments with the pulley, and they determined that 
the egg was alive and that it was 
the equivalent of a warm-blooded 
animal, although they were fairly sure that its fluids would not 



146 




 



be identical with blood. 

It was soft and unprotected by 
any covering shell and it pulsed 
and gave out some sort of vibrations. They couldn't determine 
what sort of vibrations. The little 
hairs that covered it were continually in motion. 

They put the capstone back in 
place again, but left the tripod 
and the pulley standing. 

Howard, the biologist, said, 
"It's alive and it's an organism 
of some kind, but I'm not at all 
convinced that it's pure animal. 
Those wires and that piping lead 
straight into it, as if, you'd almost swear, the piping and the 
wires were a part of it. And look 
at these - - what would you call 
them? — these studs, almost like 
connections for other wires." 

"It's not inconceivable," said 
Spencer, "that an animal and a 
mechanism should be joined together. Take Man and his machines. Man and the machines 
work together, but Man maintains his individual identity and 
the machines maintain their own. 
In a lot of cases it would make 
more sense, economically, if not 
socially, that Man and machine 
should be one, that the two of 
them be joined together, become, 
in face, one organism." 

Dyer said, "I think that may be 
what we have here." 

"Those other towers?" asked 
Ellis. 



"They could be connected," 
Spencer suggested, "associated in 
some way. All eight of them 
could be, as a matter of principle, 
one complex organism." 

"We don't know what's in those 
other towers," said Ellis. 

"We could find out," Howard 
answered. 

"No, we can't," objected Spencer. "We don't dare. We've fooled 
around with them more than was 
safe. Mac and his crew went for 
a walk and found the towers and 
examined them, just casually, 
you understand, and they came 
back not knowing how to operate 
the engines. We can't take the 
chance of fooling around with 
them a minute longer than is 
necessary. Already we may have 
lost more than we suspect." 

"You mean," said Clyne, 
"that the loss of memory we may 
have experienced will show up 
later? That we may not know 
now we've lost it, but will find 
later that we did?" 

OPENCER nodded. "That's 
^ what happened to Mac. He 
or any member of his crew, would 
have sworn, up to the minute 
that they tried to start the engines, that they could start them. 
They took it for granted, just as 
we take our knowledge for granted. Until we come to use the 
specific knowledge we have lost, 
we won't realize we've lost it."

"It scares you just to think 
about it," Howard said. 

Lang said, "It's some sort of 
communications system." 

"Naturally you'd think so. 
You're a communications man." 

"Those wires." 

"And what about the pipes?" 
asked Howard. 

"I have a theory on that one," 
Spencer told them. "The pipes 
supply the food." 

"Attached to some food supply," said Clyne. "A tank of food 
buried in the ground." 

"More likely roots," Howard 
put in. "To talk of tanks of food 
would mean these are transplanted things. They could just as 
easily be native to this planet." 

"They couldn't have built those 
towers," said Ellis. "If they were 
native, they'd had to build those 
towers themselves. Something or 
someone else built the towers, 
like a farmer builds a barn to 
protect his cattle. I'd vote for 
tanks of food." 

Warren spoke for the first 
time. "What makes you think 
it's a communications setup?" 

Lang shrugged. "Nothing specific. Those wires, I guess, and 
the studs. It looks like a communications rig." 

"Communications might fill 
the bill," Spencer nodded. "But 
a communications machine built 
to take in information rather 
than to pass information along or 



disseminate it." 

"What are you getting at?" demanded Lang. "How would that 
be communication?" 

"I mean," said Spencer, "that 
something has been robbing us of 
our memory. It stole our ability 
to run the engines and it took 
enough knowledge away from us 
so we bungled the junkyard job." 

"It couldn't be that," said 
Dyer. 

"Why couldn't it?" asked 
Clyne. 

"It's just too damn fantastic." 

""[VTO more fantastic," Spencer 
^ ^ told him, "than a lot of 
other things we've found. Say 
that egg is a device for gathering 
knowledge . . ." 

"But there's no knowledge to 
gather here," protested Dyer. 
"Thousands of years ago, there 
was knowledge to gather from 
the rusted ship out there. And 
then, just a while ago, there was 
knowledge to gather from the 
junkyard ship. And now there's 
us. But the next shipload of 
knowledge won't come along for 
maybe uncounted thousands of 
years. It's too long to wait, too 
big a gamble. Three ships we 
know of have come here; it 
would be just as reasonable to 
suppose that no ship would ever 
come here. It doesn't make any 
sense." 

"Who said that the knowledge 



148 




 



had to be collected here? Even 
back on Earth we forget, don't 
we?" 

"Good Lord!" gasped Clyne, 
but Spencer rushed ahead. 

"If you were some race setting 
out fish traps for knowledge and 
had plenty of time to gather it, 
where would you put your traps? 
On a planet that swarmed with 
sentient beings, where the traps 
might be found and destroyed or 
their secrets snatched away? Or 
would you put them on some uninhabited, out-of-the-way planet, 
some second-rate world that 
won't be worth a tinker's dam to 
anyone for another billion years?" 

Warren said, "I'd put them on 
a planet just like this." 

"Let me give you the picture," 
Spencer continued. "Some race 
is bent on trapping knowledge 
throughout the Galaxy. So they 
hunt up the little, insignificant, 
good-for-nothing planets where 
they can hide their traps. That 
way, with traps planted on strategically spaced planets, they 
sweep all space and there's little 
chance that their knowledge traps 
ever will be found." 

"You think that's what we've 
found here?" asked Clyne. 

"I'm tossing you the idea," 
said Spencer, "to see what you 
think of it. Now let's hear your 
comments." 

"Well, the distance, for one 
thing—" 



"What we have here," said 
Spencer, "is mechanical telepathy 
hooked up with a recording device. We know that distance has 
little to do with the speed of 
thought waves." 

"There's no other basis for this 
belief beyond speculation?" asked 
Warren. 

"What else can there be? You 
certainly can't expect proof. We 
don't dare to get close enough to 
find out what this egg is. And 
maybe, even if we could, we 
haven't got enough knowledge 
left in us to make an intelligent 
decision or a correct deduction." 

"So we guess again," said Warren. 

"Have you some better method?" 

Warren shook his head. "No, 
I don't think I have." 

XIII 

T"\YER put on a spacesuit, with 
a rope running from it to 
the pulley in the tripod set above 
the tower. He carried wires to 
connect to the studs. The other 
ends of the wires were connected 
to a dozen different instruments 
to see what might come over 
them — if anything. 

Dyer climbed the tower and 
they lowered him down into the 
inside of the tower. Almost immediately, he quit talking to 
them, so they pulled him out. 



JUNKYARD 



149 



When they loosened the spacesuit helmet and hinged it back, 
he gurgled and blew bubbles at 
them. 

Old Doc gently led him back 
to sick bay. 

Clyne and Pollard worked for 
hours designing a lead helmet 
with television installed instead 
of vision plates. Howard, the biologist, climbed inside the spacesuit and was lowered into the 
tower. 

When they hauled him out a 
minute later, he was crying — like 
a child. Ellis hurried him after 
Old Doc and Dyer, with Howard 
clutching his hands and babbling 
between sobs. 

After ripping the television 
unit out of the helmet, Pollard 
was all set to go in the helmet 
made of solid lead when Warren 
put a stop to it. 

"You keep this up much longer," he told them, "and we'll 
have no one left." 

"This one has a chance of 
working," Clyne declared. » "It 
might have been the television 
lead-ins that let them get at 
Howard." 

"It has a chance of not working, too." 

"But we have to try." 

"Not until I say so." 

Pollard started to put the solid 
helmet on his head. 

"Don't put that thing on," said 
Warren. "You're not going any


where you'll be needing it." 

"I'm going in the tower," Pollard said flatly. 

Warren took a step toward him 
and without warning lashed out 
with his fist. It caught Pollard on 
the jaw and crumpled him. 

Warren turned to face the rest 
of them. "If there's anyone else 
who thinks he wants to argue, 
I'm ready to begin the discussion 
— in the same way." 

None of them wanted to argue. 
He could see the tired disgust 
for him written on their faces. 

Spencer said, "You're upset, 
Warren. You don't know what 
you're doing." 

"I know damned well what 
I'm doing," Warren retorted. "I 
know there must be a way to get 
into that tower and get out again 
with some of your memory left. 
But the way you're going about 
it isn't the right way." 

"You know another?" asked 
Ellis bitterly. 

"No, I don't," said Warren. 
"Not yet." 

"What do you want us to do?" 
demanded Ellis. "Sit around and 
twiddle our thumbs?" 

"I want you to behave like 
grown men," said Warren, "not 
like a bunch of crazy kids out to 
rob an orchard." 

He stood and looked at them 
and none of them had a word to 
say. 

"I have three mewling babies 



150 




 



on my hands right now," he added. "I don't want any more." 

He walked away, up the hill, 
heading for the ship. 

XIV 

''■''HEIR memory had been 
-■- stolen, probably by the egg 
that squatted in the tower. And 
although none of them had dared 
to say the thought aloud, the 
thing that all of them were thinking was that maybe there was a 
way to steal that knowledge back, 
to tap and drain all the rest of 
the knowledge that was stored 
within the egg. 

Warren sat at his desk and 
held his head in his hands, trying 
to think. 

Maybe he should have let 
them go ahead with what they 
had been doing. But if he had, 
they'd have kept right on, using 
variations of the same approach 
— and when the approach had 
failed twice, they should have 
figured out that approach was 
wrong and tried another. 

Spencer had said that they'd 
lost knowledge and not known 
they had lost it, and that was the 
insidious part of the whole situation. They still thought of themselves as men of science, and 
they were, of course, but not as 
skilled, not as knowledgable as 
•» they once had been. 

That was the hell of it — they 



still thought they were. 

They despised him now and 
that was all right with him. Anything was all right with him if it 
would help them discover a way 
to escape. 

Forgetfulness, he thought. All 
through the Galaxy, there was 
forgetfulness. There were explanations for that forgetfulness, 
very learned and astute theories 
on why a being should forget 
something it had learned. But 
might not all these explanations 
be wrong? Might it not be that 
forgetfulness could be traced, not 
to some kink within the brain, 
not to some psychic cause, but to 
thousands upon thousands of 
memory traps planted through 
the Galaxy, traps that tapped 
and drained and nibbled away at 
the mass memory of all the 
sentient beings which lived among 
the stars? 

On Earth a man would forget 
slowly over the span of many 
years and that might be because 
the memory traps that held Earth 
in their orbit were very far away. 
But here a man forgot completely and suddenly. Might that not 
be because he was within the 
very shadow of the memory 
traps? 

He tried to imagine Operation 
Mind Trap and it was a shocking 
concept too big for the brain to 
grasp. Someone came to the 
backwoods planets, the good-for


JUNKYARD 



151 



nothing planets, the sure-to-bepassed-by planets and set out 
the memory traps. 

They hooked them up in series 
and built towers to protect them 
from weather or from accident, 
t and set them operating and connected them to tanks of nutrients 
buried deep within the soil. Then 
they went away. 

And years later — how many 
years later, a thousand, ten thousand? — they came back again 
and emptied the traps of the 
knowledge they had gathered. As 
a trapper sets out traps to catch 
animals for fur, or a fisherman 
should set the pots for lobsters 
or drag the seine for fish. 

A harvest, Warren thought — a 
continual, never-ending harvest 
of the knowledge of the Galaxy. 

TF this were true, what kind of 
■■■ race would it be that set the 
traps? What kind of trapper 
would be plodding the starways, 
gathering his catch? 

Warren's reason shrank away 
from the kind of race that it 
would be. 

The creatures undoubtedly 
came back again, after many 
years, and emptied the traps of 
the knowledge they had snared. 
That must be what they'd do, 
for why otherwise would they 
bother to set out the traps? And 
if they could empty the traps of 
the knowledge they had caught, 



that meant there was some way 
to empty them. And if the trappers themselves could drain off 
the knowledge, so could another 
race. 

If you could only get inside the 
tower and have a chance to figure 
out the way, you could do the 
job, for probably it was a simple 
thing, once you had a chance to 
see it. But you couldn't get inside. 
If you did, you were robbed. of 
all memory and came out a 
squalling child. The moment you 
got inside, the egg grabbed onto 
your mind and wiped it clean 
and you didn't even know why 
you were there or how you'd got 
there or where you were. 

The trick was to get inside and 
still keep your memory, to get 
inside and still know what there 
was to do. 

Spencer and the others had 
tried shielding the brain and 
shielding didn't work. Maybe 
there was a way to make it work, 
but you'd have had to use trial 
and error methods and that 
meant too many men coming out 
with their memories gone before 
you had the answer. It meant 
that maybe in just a little while 
you'd have no men at all. 

There must be another way. 

When you couldn't shield a 
thing, what did you do? 

A communications problem, 
Lang had said. Perhaps Lang was m 
right — the egg was a communica


152 




 



tions setup. And what did you 
do to protect communications? 
When you couldn't shield a 
communication, what did you do 
with it? 

There was an answer to that 
one, of course — you scrambled it. 

But there was no solution 
there, nor any hint of a solution. 
He sat and listened and there was 
no sound. No one had stopped 
by to see him; no one had dropped in to pass the time of day. 

They're sore, he thought. 
They're off sulking in a corner. 
They're giving me the silent 
treatment. 

To hell with them, he said. 

He sat alone and tried to think 
and there were no thoughts, just 
a mad merry-go-round of questions revolving in his skull. 

Finally there were footsteps on 
the stairs and from their unsteadiness, he knew whose they were. 

It was Bat Ears coming up to 
comfort him and Bat Ears had a 
skin full. 

He waited, listening to the 
stumbling feet tramping up the 
stairs, and Bat Ears finally appeared. He stood manfully in the 
doorway, putting out both hands 
and bracing them against the 
jambs on either side of him to 
keep the place from swaying. 

T> AT EARS nerved himself and 
plunged across the space 
from doorway to chair and grab


bed the chair and hung onto it 
and wrestled himself into it and 
looked up at Warren with a 
smirk of triumph. 

"Made it," Bat Ears said. 

"You're drunk," snapped Warren disgustedly. 

"Sure, I'm drunk. It's lonesome 
being drunk all by yourself. 
Here . . ." 

He found his pocket and hauled the bottle out and set it gingerly on the desk. 

"There you are," he said. "Let's 
you and me go and hang one on." 

Warren stared at the bottle and 
listened to the little imp of 
thought that jigged within his 
brain. 

"No, it wouldn't work." 

"Cut out the talking and start 
working on that jug. When you 
get through with that one, I got 
another hid out." 

"Bat Ears," said Warren. 

"What do you want?" asked 
Bat Ears. "I never saw a man 
that wanted — " 

"How much more have you 
got?" 

"How much more what, Ira?" 

"Liquor. How much more do 
you have stashed away?" 

"Lots of it. I always bring 
along a marg ... a marg . . ." 

"A margin?" 

"That's right," said Bat Ears. 
"That is what I meant. I always 
figure what I need and then bring 
along a margin just in case we

get marooned or something." 

Warren reached out and took 
the bottle. He uncorked it and 
threw the cork away. 

"Bat Ears," he said, "go and 
get another bottle." 

Bat Ears blinked at him. 
"Right away, Ira? You mean 
right away?" 

"Immediately," said Warren. 
"And on your way, would you 
stop and tell Spencer that I want 
to see him soon as possible?" 

Bat Ears wobbled to his feet. 

He regarded Warren with 
forthright admiration. 

"What you planning on doing, 
Ira?" he demanded. 

"I'm going to get drunk," said 
Warren. "I'm going to hang one 
on that will make history in the 
survey fleet." 

XV 

'"Y^OU can't do it, man," pro-■- tested Spencer. "You haven't 
got a chance." 

Warren put out a hand against 
the tower and tried to hold himself a little steadier, for the whole 
planet was gyrating at a fearful 
pace. 

"Bat Ears," Warren called out. 
"Yes, Ira." 

"Shoot the — hie — man who 
tries to shtop me." 

"I'll do that, Ira," Bat Ears 
assured him. 

"But you're going in there un


protected," Spencer said anxiously. "Without even a spacesuit." 

"I'm trying out a new appro 
. . . appro . . ." 

"Approach?" supplied Bat 
Ears. 

"Thash it," said Warren. "I 
thank you, Bat Ears. Thash exactly what I'm doing." 

Lang said, "It's got a chance. 
We tried to shield ourselves and 
it didn't work. He's trying a new 
approach. He's scrambled up his 
mind with liquor. I think he 
might have a chance." 

"The shape he's in," said Spencer, "he'll never get the wires 
connected." 

Warren wobbled a little. "The 
hell you shay." 

He stood and blurredly watched them. Where there had been 
three of each of them before, 
there now, in certain cases, were 
only two of them. 

"Bat Ears." 

"Yes, Ira." 

"I need another drink. It's 
wearing off a little." 

Bat Ears took the bottle from 
his pocket and handed it across. 
It was not quite half full. Warren 
tipped it up and drank, his 
Adam's apple bobbing. He did 
not quit drinking until the last of 
it was gone. He let the bottle 
drop and looked at them again. 
This time there were three of each 
of them and it was all right. 

He turned to face the tower.

"Now," he said, "if you gen'men will jush — " 

Ellis and Clyne hauled on the 
rope and Warren sailed into the 
air. 

"Hey, there!" he shouted. 
"Wha' you trying to do?" 

He had forgotten about the 
pulley rigged on the tripod above 
the tower. 

He dangled in the air, kicking 
and trying to get his balance, 
with the blackness of the tower's 
mouth looming under him and a 
funny, shining glow at the bottom 
of it. 

Above him the pulley creaked 
and he shot down and was inside 
the tower. 

He could see the thing at the 
bottom now. He hiccoughed politely and told it to move over, 
he was coming down. It didn't 
move an inch. Something tried to 
take his head off and it didn't 
come off. 

The earphones said, "Warren, 
you all right? You all right? Talk 
to us." 

"Sure," he said. "Sure, all right. 
Wha' matter wish you?" 

npHEY let him down and he 
stood beside the funny thing 
that pulsated in the pit. He felt 
something digging at his brain 
and laughed aloud, a gurgling, 
drunken laugh. 

"Get your handsh out my 
hair," he said. "You tickle." 



"Warren," said the earphones. 
"The wires. The wires. You remember, we talked about the 
wires." 

"Sure," he said. "The wires." 

There were little studs on the 
pulsating thing and they'd be fine 
things to attach a wire to. 

Wires? What the hell were 
wires? 

"Hooked on your belt," said 
the earphones. "The wires are 
hooked on your belt." 

His hand moved to his belt and 
he found the wires. He fumbled 
with them and they slipped out 
of his fingers and he got down 
and scrabbled around and grabbed hold of them again. They 
were all tangled up and he couldn't make head or tail of them and 
what was he messing around with 
wires for, anyhow? 

What he wanted was another 
drink — another little drink. 

He sang: "I'm a rambliri wreck 
from Georgia Tech and a hell of 
an engineer.'" 

He said to the egg: "Friend, 
I'd be mosh pleashed if you'd 
join me in a drink." 

The earphones said, "Your 
friend can't drink until you get 
those wires hooked up. He can't 
hear without the wires hooked up. 
He can't tell what you're saying 
until you get those wires hooked 
up. 

"You understand, Warren? 
Hook up the wires. He can't hear 



JUNKYARD 



155 



till you do." 

"Now, thash too bad," said 
Warren. "Thash an awful thing." 

He did the best he could to get 
the wires hooked up and he told 
his new friend just to be patient 
and hold still, he was doing the 
best he could. He yelled for Bat 
Ears to hurry with the bottle and 
he sang a ditty which was quite 
obscene. And finally he got the 
wires hooked up, but the man in 
the earphones said that wasn't 
right, to try it once again. He 
changed the wires around some 
more and they still weren't right, 
and so he changed them around 
again, until the man in the earphones said, "That's fine! We're 




getting something now!" 

And then someone hauled him 
out of there before he even had 
a drink with his pal. 

XVI 

TIE stumbled up the stairs and 
negotiated his way around 
the desk and plopped into the 
chair. Someone had fastened a 
steel bowl securely over the top 
half of his head and two men, 
or possibly three, were banging 
it with hammer, and his mouth 
had a wool blanket wadded up in 
it, and he could have sworn that 
at any moment he'd drop dead 
of thirst. 




He heard footsteps on the stairs 
and hoped that it was Bat Ears, 
for Bat Ears would know what to 
do. 

But it was Spencer. 
"How're you feeling?" Spencer 
asked. 

"Awful," Warren groaned. 

"You turned the trick!" 

"That tower business?" 

"You hooked up the wires," 
said Spencer, "and the stuff is 
rolling out. Lang has a recorder 
hooked up and we're taking turns 
listening in and the stuff we're 
getting is enough to set your 
teeth on edge." 

"Stuff?" 

"Certainly. The knowledge that 
mind trap has been collecting. 
It'll take us years to sort out all 
the knowledge and try to correlate it. Some of it is just in 
snatches and some of it is fragmentary, but we're getting lots 
of it in hunks." 

"Some of our own stuff being 
fed back to us?" 

"A little. But mostly alien." 

"Anything on the engines?" 

Spencer hesitated. "No, not on 
our engines. That is — " 

"Well?" 

"We got the dope on the junkyard engine. Pollard's already at 
work. Mac and the boys are helping him get it assembled." 

"It'll work?" 

"Better than what we have. 
We'll have to modify our tubes 



JUNKYARD 



157 



and make some other changes." 

"And you're going to — " 

Spencer nodded. "We're ripping out our engines." 

Warren couldn't help it. He 
couldn't have helped it if he'd 
been paid a .million dollars. He 
put his arms down on the desk 
and hid his face in them and 
shouted raucously with incoherent 
laughter. 

After a time he looked up again 
and mopped at laughter-watered 
eye* 

"I fail to see — " Spencer began 
stiffly. 

"Another junkyard," Warren 
said. "Oh, God, another junkyard!" 

"It's not so funny, Warren. It's 
brain-shaking — a mass of knowledge such as no one ever dreamed 
of. Knowledge that had been accumulating for years, maybe a 
thousand years. Ever since that 
other race came and emptied the 
trap and then went away again." 

"T OOK," said Warren, "couldn't 
we wait until we came across 
the knowledge of our engines? 
Surely it will come out soon. 
It went in, was fed in, whatever you want to call it, later 
than any of the rest of this stuff 
you are getting. If we'd just wait, 
we'd have the knowledge that we 
lost. We wouldn't have to go to 
all the work of ripping out the 
engines and replacing them." 



SPENCER shook his head. 
"Lang figured it out. There 
seems to be no order or sequence 
in the way we get the information. The chances are that we • 
might have to wait for a long, 
long time. We have no way of 
knowing how long the information will keep pouring out. Lang 
thinks for maybe years. But 
there's something else. We've got 
to get away as soon as possible." 

"What's the matter with you, 
Spencer?" 

"I don't know." 
"You're afraid of something. 
Something's got you scared." 

Spencer bent over and grasped 
the desk edge with his hands, 
hanging on. 

"Warren, it's not only knowledge in that thing. We're monitoring it and we know. There's 
also — " 

"I'll take a guess," said Warren. "There's personality." 

He saw the stricken look on 
Spencer's face. 

"Quit monitoring it," ordered 
Warren sharply. "Turn the whole 
thing off. Let's get out of here." 

"We can't. Don't you understand? We can't! There are certain points. We are — " 

"Yes, I know," said Warren. . 
"You are men of science. Also 
downright fools." 

"But there are things coming 
out of that tower that — ''' 

"Shut it off!" 



158 




 



"No," said Spencer obstinately. 
"I can't. I won't." 

"I warn you," Warren said 
grimly, "if any of you turn alien, 
I'll shoot you without hesitation." 

"Don't be a fool." Spencer 
turned sharply about and went 
out the door. 

Warren sat, sober now, listening to Spencer's feet go down the 
steps. 

It was all very clear to Warren 
now. 

Now he knew why there had 
been evidence of haste in that 
other ship's departure, why supplies had been left behind and 
tools still lying where they had 
been dropped as the crew had 
fled. 

After a while Bat Ears came 
up the stairs, lugging a huge pot 
of coffee and a couple of cups. 

He set the cups down on the 
desk and filled them, then banged 
down the pot. 

"Ira," he said, "it was a black 
day when you gave up your 
drinking." 

"How is that?" asked Warren. 

"Because there ain't no one, 
nowhere, who can hang one on 
like you." 




HEY sat silently, gulping the 
hot, black coffee. 



Then Bat Ears said, "I still 
don't like it." 

"Neither do I," admitted Warren. 

"The cruise is only half over," 
said Bat Ears. 

"The cruise is completely 
over," Warren told him bluntly. 
"When we lift out of here, we're 
heading straight for Earth." 

They drank more coffee. 

Warren asked: "How many on 
our side, Bat Ears?" 

"There's you and me," said Bat 
Ears, "and Mac and the four engineers. That's seven." 

"Eight," corrected Warren. 
"Don't forget Doc. He hasn't been 
doing any monitoring." 

"Doc don't count for nothing 
one way or the other." 

"In a pinch, he still can handle 
a gun." 

After Bat Ears had gone, Warren sat and listened to the sound 
of Mac's crew ripping out the 
engines and he thought of the 
long way home. Then he got up 
and strapped on a gun and went 
out to see how things were shaping up.

FORECAST 



Next month, you're due for a relentlessly suspenseful novella, TANGLE 
HOLD by F. L. Wallace, a breathless story of Venus and the oddest sort of 
engineer you've ever encountered. It's his skill that gets him into trouble to 
begin with, but that isn't what makes him unwittingly the greatest force for 
good on that cloudy planet— which might have been all right, except that 
what was good for Venus was pure murder for him! 

J. T. M'lntosh's novelet, FIRST LADY, offers an entirely different type of 
problem: The task of Terran Control is to explore, subdue and integrate 
raw new worlds into the galactic economy, which naturally means nasty jobs 
for its agents. The nastiest job, though, is not what you might expect— it's 
taking a dazed young girl out into space to rule over an all-male planet! 

There's an equally disquieting situation in the second novelet in the 
issue, COLONY by Philip K. Dick. It's bad enough to have an alien enemy, 
of course, but worse still when you can't be sure it is an enemy. But what 
happens when you can't even find it in the first place? 

Short stories, features . . . and don't forget that Willy Ley answers all 
science questions either by mail or in FOR YOUR INFORMATION. Whafs on 
your mind? Don't keep it to yourself; let Mr. Ley explain it to you. But please 
type or print so your letter will be legible, hold down the number of questions 
to no more than two or three, and sign your name and address in case the 
answer must be mailed.

What Strange Powers 

Did The Ancients Possess? 




CVERY important discovery relating 
to mind power, sound thinking and 
cause and effect, as applied to selfadvancement, was known centuries ago, 
before the masses could read and write. 

Much has been written about the wise 
men of old. A popular fallacy has it that 
their secrets of personal power and sue 
cessful living were lost to the world. 
Knowledge of nature's laws, accumulated through the ages, is never lost. At 
times the great truths possessed by the 
sages were hidden from unscrupulous 
men in high places, but never destroyed. 

Why Were Their Secrets 
Closely Guarded? 

Only recently, as time is measured; not 
more than twenty generations ago. less 
than 1/1 00th of 1% of the earth's 
people were thought capable of receiving basic knowledge about the laws of 
life, for it is an elementary truism that 
knowledge is power and that power 
cannot be entrusted to the ignorant 
and the unworthy. 

Wisdom is not readily attainable by the 
general public; nor recognized when 
right within reach. The average person 
absorbs a multitude of details about 
things, but goes through life without 
ever knowing where and how to acquire 
mastery of the fundamentals of the inner 
mind — that mysterious silent something 
which "whispers" to you from within. 

Fundamental Laws of Nature 

Your habits, accomplishments and weaknesses are the effects of causes. Your 
thoughts and actions are governed by 
fundamental laws. Example: The law 



of compensation is as fundamental as 
the laws of breathing, eating and sleeping. All fixed laws of nature are as 
fascinating to study as they are vital to 
understand for success in life. 

You can learn to find and follow every 
basic law of life. You can begin at any 
time to discover a whole new world of 
interesting truths. You can start at once 
to awaken your inner powers of selfunderstanding and self-advancement. 
You can learn from one of the world's 
oldest institutions, first known in America in 1694. Enjoying the high regard 
of hundreds of leaders', thinkers and 
teachers, the order is known as the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. It6 complete name 
is the "Ancient and Mystical Order 
Rosae Crucis," abbreviated by the initials "AMORC." The teachings of the 
Order are not sold, for it is not a commercial organization, nor is it a religious 
sect. It is a non-profit fraternity, a 
brotherhood in the true sense. 

Not For General Distribution 

Sincere men and women, in search of 
the truth — those who wish to fit in with 
the ways of the world — are invited to 
write for complimentary copy of the 
sealed booklet, "The Mastery of Life." 
It tells how to contact the librarian of 
the archives of AMORC for this rare 
knowledge. This booklet is not intended 
for general distribution; nor is it sent 
without request. It is therefore suggested 
that you write for your copy to: Scribe
