wrung a lot of information out 
of it and could parade an impressive roll of facts. But here there 
was no actual, concrete fact beyond the one that would have 
been obvious to a twelve-yearold child. 

Commander Ira Warren was 
worried about it. He said as much 
to Bat Ears Brady, ship's cook 
and slightly disreputable pal of 
his younger days. The two of 
them had been planet-checking 
together for more than thirty 
years. While they stood at opposite poles on the table of organization, they were able to say to 
one another things they could not 
have said to any other man 
aboard the survey ship or have 
allowed another man to say to 
them. 

"Bat Ears," said Warren, "I'm 
just a little worried." 

"You're always worried," Bat 
Ears retorted. "That's part of the 
job you have." 

"This junkyard business . . ." 

"You wanted to get ahead," 
said Bat Ears, "and I told you 
what would happen. I warned 
you you'd get yourself weighed 
down with worry and authority 
and pomp — pomp — " 

"Pomposity?" 

"That's the word," said Bat 
Ears. "That's the word, exactly." 

"I'm not pompous, Warren 
contradicted. 

"No, you're worried about this 



junkyard business. I got a bottle 
stowed away. How about a little 
drink?" 

WARREN waved away the 
thought. "Someday I'll bust 
you wide open. Where you hide 
the stuff, I don't know, but every 
trip we make . . ." 

"Now, Ira! Don't go losing 
your lousy temper." 

"Every trip we make, you carry enough dead weight of liquor 
to keep you annoyingly aglow 
for the entire cruise." 

"It's baggage," Bat Ears insisted. "A man is allowed some 
baggage weight. I don't have 
hardly nothing else. I just bring 
along my drinking." 

"Someday," said Warren savagely, "it's going to get you 
booted off- the ship about five 
light-years from nowhere." 

The threat was an old one. It 
failed to dismay Bat Ears. 

"This worrying you're doing," 
Bat Ears said, "ain't doing you 
no good." 

"But the survey team didn't do 
the job," objected Warren. "Don't 
you see what this means? For the 
first time in more than a hundred 
years of survey, we've found what 
appears to be evidence that some 
other race than Man has achieved space flight. And we don't 
know a thing about it. We should 
know. With all that junk out 
there, we'd ought to be able by 



126 




 



this time to write a book about 
it." 

Bat Ears spat in contempt. 
"You mean them scientists of 
ours." 

The way he said "scientist" 
made it a dirty word. 

"They're good," said Warren. 
"The very best there is." 

"Remember the old days, Ira?" 
asked Bat Ears. "When you was 
second looey and you used to 
come down and we'd have a drink 
together and . . ." 

"That has nothing to do with 
it." 

"We had real men in them 
days. We'd get ourselves a club 
and go hunt us up some natives 
and beat a little sense into them 
and we'd get more facts in half 
a day than these scientists, with 
all their piddling around, will get 
in a month of Sundays." 

"This is slightly different," 
Warren said. "There are no natives here." 

There wasn't, as a matter of 
fact, much of anything on this 
particular planet. It was strictly 
a low-grade affair and it wouldn't 
amount to much for another billion years. The survey, understandably, wasn't too interested 
in planets that wouldn't amount 
to much for another billion years. 

Its surface was mostly rock 
outcroppings and tumbled boulder fields. In the last half million years or so, primal plants 



had gotten started and were doing well. Mosses and lichens crept 
into the crevices and crawled 
across the rocks, but aside from 
that there seemed to be no life. 
Although, strictly speaking, you 
couldn't be positive, for no one 
had been interested in the planet. 
They hadn't looked it over and 
they ' hadn't searched for life; 
everyone had been too interested 
in the junkyard. 

They had never intended to 
land, but had circled the planet, 
making routine checks and entering routine data in the survey 
record. 

Then someone at a telescope 
had seen the junkyard and they'd 
gone down to investigate and had 
been forthrightly pitchforked into 
a maddening puzzle. 

rpHEY had called it the junkyard and that was what it was. 
Strewn about were what probably were engine parts, although 
no one was quite sure. Pollard, 
the mech engineer, had driven 
himself to the verge of frenzy trying to figure out how to put some 
of the parts together. He finally 
got three of them assembled, 
somehow, and they didn't mean 
a thing, so he tried to take them 
apart again to figure out how he'd 
done it. He couldn't get them 
apart. It was about that time that 
Pollard practically blew his top. 
The engine parts, if that was 



JUNKYARD 



127 



what they were, were scattered 
all over the place, as if someone 
or something had tossed them 
away, not caring where they fell. 
But off to one side was a pile of 
other stuff, all neatly stacked, 
and it was apparent even to the 
casual glance that this stuff must 
be a pile of supplies. 

There was what more than 
likely was food, though it was a 
rather strange kind of food (if 
that was what it was), and 
strangely fabricated bottles of 
plastic that held a poison liquid, 
and other stuff that was fabric 
and might have been clothing, 
although it gave one the shudders trying to figure out what 
sort of creatures would have worn 
that kind of clothing and bundles 
of metallic bars, held together in 
the bundles by some kind of gravitational attraction instead of 
the wires that a human would 
have used to tie them in bundles. 
And a number of other objects 
for which there were no names. 

"They should have found the 
answer," Warren said. "They've 
cracked tougher nuts than this. 
In the month we've been here, 
they should have had that engine running." 

"If it is an engine," Bat Ears 
pointed out. 

"What else could it be?" 

"You're getting so that you 
sound like them. Run into something that you can't explain and 



think up the best guess possible 
and when someone questions you, 
you ask what else it could be. 
And that ain't proof, Ira." 

"You're right, Bat Ears," Warren admitted. "It certainly isn't 
proof and that's what worries me. 
We have no doubt the junk out 
there is a spaceship engine, but 
we have no proof of it." 

"Nobody's going to land a 
ship," said Bat Ears testily, "and 
rip out the engine and just throw 
it away. If they'd done that, the 
ship would still be here." 

"But if that's not the answer," 
demanded Warren, "what is all 
that stuff out there?" 

"I wouldn't know. I'm not even 
curious. I ain't the one that's worrying." 

He got up from the chair and 
moved toward the door. 

"I still got that bottle, Ira." 

"No, thanks," Warren said. 

He sat and listened to Bat 
Ear's feet going down the stairs. 

II 

ly-ENNETH SPENCER, the 
alien psychologist, came into 
the cabin and sat down in the 
chair across the desk from Warren. 

"We're finally through," he 
said. 

"You aren't through," challenged Warren. "You haven't 
even started." 



128 




 



"We've done all we can." 

Warren grunted at him. ' 

"We've run all sorts of tests," 
said Spencer. "We've got a book 
full of analyses. We have a complete photographic record and 
everything is down on paper in 
diagrams and notes and — " 

"Then tell me: What is that 
junk out there?" 

"It's a spaceship engine." 

"If it's an engine," Warren 
said, "let's put it together. Let's 
find out how it runs. Let's figure 
out the kind of intelligence most 
likely to have built it." 

"We tried," replied Spencer. 
"All of us tried. Some of us didn't 
have applicable knowledge or 
training, but even so we worked; 
we helped the ones who had 
training." 

"I know how hard you 
worked." 

And they had worked hard, 
only snatching stolen hours to 
sleep, eating on the run. 

"We are dealing with alien mechanics," Spencer said. 

"We've dealt with other alien 
concepts," Warren reminded him. 
"Alien economics and alien religions and alien psychology . . ." 

"But this is different." 

"Not so different. Take Pollard, now. He is the key man in 
this situation. Wouldn't you have 
said that Pollard should have 
cracked it?" 

"If it can be cracked, Pollard 



is your man. He has everything — 
the theory, the experience, the 
imagination." 

"You think we should leave?" 
asked Warren. "That's what you 
came in to tell me? You think 
there is no further use of staying 
here?" 

"That's about it," Spencer admitted. 

"All right," Warren told him. 
"If you say so, I'll take your 
word for it. We'll blast off right 
after supper. I'll tell Bat Ears to 
fix us up a spread. A sort of 
achievement dinner." 

"Don't rub it in so hard," protested Spencer. "We're not proud 
of what we've done." 

Warren heaved himself out of 
the chair. 

"I'll go down and tell Mac to 
get the engines ready. On the way 
down, I'll drop in on Bat Ears 
and tell him." 

Spencer said, "I'm worried, 
Warren." 

"So am I. What is worrying 
you?" 

"Who are these things, these 
other people, who had the other 
spaceship? They're the first, you 
know, the first evidence we've 
ever run across, of another race 
that had discovered space flight. 
And what happened to them 
here?" 

"Scared?" 

"Yes. Aren't you?" 

"Not yet," said Warren. "I 



JUNKYARD 



129 



probably will be when I have the 
time to think it over." 

He went down the stairs to talk 
to Mac about the engines. 

Ill 

TTE found Mac sitting in his 
cubby hole, smoking his 
blackened pipe and reading 
his thumb-marked Bible. 

"Good news," Warren said to 
him. 

Mac laid down the book and 
took off his glasses. 

"There's but one thing you 
could tell me that would be good 
news," he said. 

"This is it. Get the engines 
ready. We'll be blasting off." 

"When, sir? Not that it can be 
too soon." 

"In a couple of hours or so," 
said Warren. "We'll eat and get 
settled in. I'll give you the word." 

The engineer folded the spectacles and slid them in his pocket. 
He tapped the pipe out in his 
hand and tossed away the ashes 
and put the dead pipe back between his teeth. 

"I've never liked this place," 
he said. 

"You never like any place." 

"I don't like them towers." 

"You're crazy, Mac. There 
aren't any towers." 

"The boys and me went walking," said the engineer. "We 
found a bunch of towers." 



"Rock formations, probably." 

"Towers," insisted the engineer doggedly. 

"If you found some towers," 
Warren demanded, "why didn't 
you report them?" 

"And have them science beagles go baying after them and 
have to stay another month?" 

"It doesn't matter," Warren 
said. "They probably aren't towers. Who would mess around 
building towers on this backwash 
of a planet?" 

"They were scary," Mac told 
him. "They had that black look 
about them. And the smell of 
death." 

"It's the Celt in you. The big, 
superstitious Celt you are, rocketing through space from world 
to world — and still believing in 
banshees and spooks. The medieval mind in the age of science." 

Mac said, "They fair give a 
man the shivers." 

They stood facing one another 
for a long moment. Then Warren put out a hand and tapped 
the other gently on the shoulder. 

"I won't say a word about 
them," he said. "Now get those 
engines rolling." 

IV 

WARREN sat in silence at the 
table's head, listening to the 
others talk. 

"It was a jury-rigged job," said 



130 




 



Clyne, the physicist. "They tore 
out a lot of stuff and rebuilt the 
engine for some reason or other 
and there was a lot of the stuff 
they tore out that they didn't use 
again. For some reason, they had 
to rebuild the engine and they 
rebuilt it simpler than it was before. Went back to basic principles and cut out the fancy stuff — 
automatics and other gadgets like 
that — but the one they rebuilt 
must have been larger and more 
unwieldy, less compact, than the 
one that they ripped down. That 
would explain why they left some 
of their supplies behind." 

"But," asked Dyer, the chemist, "what did they jury-rig it 
with? Where did they get the 
material?" 

Briggs, the metallurgist, said, 
"This place crawls with ore. If 
it wasn't so far out, it would be 
a gold mine." 

"We- saw no signs of mining," 
Dyer objected. "No signs of mining or smelting and refining or 
of fabrication." 

"We didn't go exploring," 
Clyne pointed out. "They might 
have done some mining a few 
miles away from here and we'd 
have never known it." 

Spencer said, "That's the trouble with us on this whole project. We've adopted suppositions 
and let them stand as fact. If 
they had to do some fabrication, 
it might be important to know a 



little more about it." 

"What difference does it 
make?" asked Clyne. "We know 
the basic facts — a spaceship landed here in trouble, they finally 
repaired their engines, and they 
took off once again." 

Old Doc Spears, down at the 
table's end, slammed his fork on 
his plate. 

"You don't even know," he 
said, "that it was a spaceship. 
I've listened to you caterwauling 
about this thing for weeks. I've 
never seen so damn much motion 
and so few results in all my born 
days." 

All of them looked a little surprised. Old Doc was normally a 
mild man and he usually paid 
little attention to what was going 
on, bumbling around on his regular rounds to treat a smashed 
thumb or sore throat or some 
other minor ailment. All of them 
had wondered, with a slight sickish feeling, how Old Doc might 
perform if he faced a real emergency, like major surgery, say. 
They didn't have much faith in 
him, but they liked him well 
enough. Probably they liked him 
mostly because he didn't mix into 
their affairs. 

And here he was, mixing right 
into them truculently. 

Lang, the communications 
man, said, "We found the 
scratches, Doc. You remember 
that. Scratches on the rock. The 



JUNKYARD 



131 



kind of scratches that a spaceship could have made in landing. 

"Could have made," said Doc 
derisively. 

"Must have made!" 

1~VLD Doc snorted and went on 
^-^ with his eating, holding his 
head down over the plate, napkin tucked beneath his chin, 
shoveling in the food with fork 
and knife impartially. Doc was 
noted as a messy eater. 

"I have a feeling," Spencer 
said, "that we may be off the 
beaten track in thinking of this 
as a simple repair job. From the 
amount of parts that are down 
there in the junkyard, I'd say 
that they found it necessary to 
do a redesigning job, to start from 
the beginning and build an entirely new engine to get them 
out of here. I have a feeling that 
those engine parts out there represent the whole engine, that if 
we knew how, we could put 
those parts together and we'd 
have an engine." 

"I tried it," Pollard answered. 

"I can't quite buy the idea 
that it was a complete redesigning job," Clyne stated. "That 
would mean a new approach 
and some new ideas that would 
rule out the earlier design and 
all the parts that had been built 
into the original engine as it 
stood. The theory would ex


plain why there are so many 
parts strewn around, but it's just 
not possible. You don't redesign 
an engine when you're stranded 
on a barren planet. You stick to 
what you know." 

Dyer said, "Accepting an 
idea like redesigning sends you 
back again to the problem of 
materials." 

"And tools," added Lang. 
"Where would they get the 
tools?" 

"They'd probably have a machine shop right on board the 
ship," said Spencer. 

"For minor repairs," Lang 
corrected. "Not the kind of 
equipment you would need to 
build a complete new engine." 

"What worries me," said Pollard, "is our absolute inability 
to understand any of it. I tried 
to fit those parts together, tried 
to figure out the relationship of 
the various parts — and there 
must be some sort of relationship, because unrelated parts 
would make no sense at all. Finally I was able to fit three of 
them together and that's as far 
as I could get. When I got them 
together, they didn't spell a 
thing. They simply weren't going anywhere. Even with three 
of them together, you were no 
better off, no further along in 
understanding, than before 
you'd put them together. And 
when I tried to get them apart, 



132 




 



I couldn't do that, either. You'd 
think, once a man had got a thing 
together, he could take it apart 
again, wouldn't you?" 

"It was an alien ship," Spencer 
offered, "built by alien people, 
* run by alien engines." 

"Even so," said Pollard, "there 
should have been some basic idea 
that we could recognize. In some 
way or other, their engine should 
have operated along at least one 
principle that would be basic with 
human mechanics. An engine is 
a piece of mechanism that takes 
raw power and controls it and 
directs it into useful energy. That 
would be its purpose, no matter 
what race built it." 

"The metal," said Briggs, "is 
an alien alloy, totally unlike anything we have ever run across. 
You can identify the components, 
all right, but the formula, when 
you get it down, reads like a metallic nightmare. It shouldn't 
work. By Earth standards, it 
wouldn't work. There's some secret in the combination that I 
can't even guess at." 

Old Doc said, from the table's 
end, "You're to be congratulated, 
Mr. Briggs, upon your fine sense 
of restraint." 

"Cut it out, Doc," Warren ordered sharply, speaking for the 
first time. 

"All right," said Doc. "If that's 
the way you want it, Ira, I will 
cut it out." 



V 

OTANDING outside the ship, 
^ Warren looked across the 
planet. Evening was fading into 
night and the junkyard was no 
more than a grotesque blotch of 
deeper shadow on the hillside. 

Once, not long ago, another 
ship had rested here, just a little 
way from where they rested now. 
Another ship — another race. 

And something had happened 
to that ship, something that his 
survey party had tried to ferret 
out and had fa'iled to discover. 

It had not been a simple repair 
job; he was sure of that. No matter what any of them might say, 
it had been considerably more 
than routine repair. 

There had been some sort of 
emergency, a situation with a 
strange urgency about it. They 
had left in such a hurry that they 
had abandoned some of their supplies. No commander of any 
spaceship, be he human or alien, 
would leave supplies behind except when life or death was involved in his escape. 

There was what appeared to be 
food in the stack of supplies — at 
least, Dyer had said that it was 
food, although it didn't look edible. And there were the plasticlike bottles filled with a poison 
that might be, as like as not, the 
equivalent of an alien whisky. 
And no man, Warren said, leaves 



JUNKYARD 



133 



food and whisky behind except 
in the direst emergency. 

He walked slowly down the 
trail they'd beaten between the 
ship's lock and the junkyard and 
it struck him that he walked in 
a silence that was as deep as the 
awful stillness of far space. There 
was nothing here to make any 
sound at all. There was no life 
except the mosses and the lichens 
and the other primal plants that 
crept among the rocks. In time 
there would be other life, for the 
planet had the air and water and 
the basic ingredients for soil and 
here, in another billion years or 
so, there might arise a life economy as complex as that of Earth. 

But a billion years, he thought, 
is a long, long time. 

He reached the junkyard and 
walked its familiar ground, dodging the larger pieces of machinery 
that lay all about, stumbling on 
one or two of the smaller pieces 
that lay unseen in the darkness. 

'T'HE second time he stumbled, 
he stooped and picked up the 
thing he had stumbled on and it 
was, he knew, one of the tools 
that the alien race had left behind them when they fled. He 
could picture them, dropping 
their tools and fleeing, but the 
picture was not clear. He could 
not decide what these aliens 
might have looked like or what 
they might have fled from. 



He tossed the tool up and 
down, catching it in his hand. It 
was light and handy and undoubtedly there was some use for 
it, but he did not know the use 
nor did any of the others up there 
in the ship. Hand or tentacle, 
claw or paw — what appendage 
had it been that had grasped the 
tool? What mind lay behind the 
hand or tentacle, claw or paw 
that had grasped and used it? 

He stood and threw back his 
head and looked at the stars that 
shone above the planet and they 
were not the familiar stars he had 
known when he was a child. 

Far out, he thought, far out. 
The farthest out that Man had 
ever been. 

A sound jerked him around, 
the sound of running feet coming 
down the trail. 

"Warren!" cried a voice. "Warren! Where are you?" 

There was fright in that voice, 
the frantic note of panic that one 
hears in the screaming of a terrified child. 

"Warren!" 

"Here!" shouted Warren. "Over 
here. I'm coming." 

He swung around and hurried 
to meet the man who was running in the dark. 

The runner would have charged on past him if he had not put 
out a hand and gripped him by 
the shoulder and pulled him to a 
halt. 



134 




 



"Warren! Is that you?" 

"What's the matter, Mac?" 
asked Warren. 

"I can't ... I can't . . . I . . ." 

"What's wrong? Speak up! You 
can't what, Mac?" 

He felt the engineer's fumbling 
hands reaching out for him, 
grasping at his coat lapels, hanging onto him as if the engineer 
were a drowning man. 

"Come on, come on," Warren 
urged with the impatience of 
alarm. 

"I can't start the engines, sir," 
said Mac. 

"Can't start the . . ." 

"I can't start them, sir. And 
neither can the others. None of 
us can start them, sir." 

"The engines!" said Warren, 
terror rising swiftly. "What's the 
matter with the engines?" 

"There's nothing the matter 
with the engines. It's us, sir. We 
can't start them." 

"Talk sense, man. Why can't 
you?" 

"We can't remember how. 
We've forgotten how to start the 
engines!" 

VI 

W7ARREN switched on the 
*^ light above the desk and 
straightened, seeking out the book 
among the others on the shelf. 

"It's right here, Mac," he said. 
"I knew I had it here." 



He found it and took it down 
and opened it beneath the light. 
He leafed the pages rapidly. Behind him he could hear the tense, 
almost terrified breathing of the 
engineer. 

"It's all right, Mac. It's all here 
in the book." 

He leafed too far ahead and 
had to back up a page or two and 
reached the place and spread the 
book wide beneath the lamp. 

"Now," he said, "we'll get 
those engines started. It tells right 
here . . ." 

He tried to read and couldn't. 

He could understand the words 
all right and the symbols, but 
the sum of the words he read 
made little sense and the symbols 
none at all. 

He felt the sweat breaking out 
on him, running down his forehead and gathering in his eyebrows, breaking out of his armpits 
and trickling down his ribs. 

"What's the matter, Chief?" 
asked Mac. "What's the matter 
now?" 

Warren felt his body wanting 
to shake, straining every nerve 
to tremble, but it wouldn't move. 
He was frozen stiff. 

"This is the engine manual," 
he said, his voice cold and low. 
"It tells all about the engines — 
how they operate, how to locate 
trouble, how to fix them." 

"Then we're all right," breathed Mac, enormously relieved. 



JUNKYARD 



135 



Warren closed the book. 

"No, we aren't, Mac. I've forgotten all the symbols and most 
of the terminology." 

"You what!" 

"I can't read the book," said 
Warren. 

VII 




T just isn't possible," argued 
Spencer. 



"It's not only possible," Warren told him. "It happened. Is 
there any one of you who can 
read that book?" 

They didn't answer him. 

"If there's anyone who can," 
invited Warren, "step up and 
show us how." 

Clyne said quietly, "There's 
none of us can read it." 

"And yet," declared Warren, 
"an hour ago any one of you — 
any single one of you — probably 
would have bet his life that he 
not only could start the engines 
if he had to, but could take the 
manual if he couldn't and figure 
how to do it." 

"You're right," Clyne agreed. 
"We would have bet our lives. 
An hour ago we would have. It 
would have been a safe, sure 
bet." 

"That's what you think," said 
Warren. "How do you know how 
long it's been since you couldn't 
read the manual?" 

"We don't, of course," Clyne 



was forced to admit. 

"There's something more. You 
didn't find the answer to the 
junkyard. You guessed an answer, 
but you didn't find one. And you 
should have. You know damn 
well you should have." 

Clyne rose to his feet. "Now 
see here, Warren . . ." 

"Sit down, John," said Spencer. 
"Warren's got us dead to rights. 
We didn't find an answer and we 
know we didn't. We took a guess 
and substituted it for the answer 
that we didn't find. And Warren's 
right about something else — we 
should have found the answer." 

Under any other circumstances, 
Warren thought, they might have 
hated him for those blunt truths, 
but now they didn't. They just 
sat there and he could see the 
realization seeping into them. 

Dyer finally said, "You think 
we failed out there because we 
forgot — just like Mac forgot." 

"You lost some of your skills," 
replied Warren, "some of your 
skills and knowledge. You worked as hard as ever. You went 
through the motions. You didn't 
have the skill or knowledge any 
more, that's all." 

"And now?" asked Lang. 

"I don't know." 

"This is what happened to that 
other ship," said Briggs emphatically. 

"Maybe," Warren said with 
less conviction. 



136 




 



"But they got away," Clyne 
pointed out. 

"So will we," promised Warren. "Somehow." 

VIII 

rpHE crew of that other, alien 
ship had evidently forgotten, 
too. But somehow or other they 
had blasted off — somehow or 
other they had remembered, or 
forced themselves to remember. 
But if it had been the simple matter of remembering, why had they 
rebuilt the engines? They could 
have used their own. 

Warren lay in his bunk, staring into the blackness, knowing 
that a scant two feet above his 
head there was a plate of steel, 
but he couldn't see the steel. And 
he knew there was a way to start 
the engines, a simple way once 
you knew it or remembered it, 
but he couldn't see that, either. 

Man experienced incidents, 
gathered knowledge, knew emotion — and then, in the course of 
time, forgot the incident and 
knowledge and emotion. Life was 
a long series of forgettings. Memories were wiped out and old 
knowledge dulled and skill was 
lost, but it took time to wipe it 
out or dull it or lose it. You 
couldn't know a thing one day 
and forget it on the next. 

But here on this barren world, 
in some impossible way, the for


getting had been speeded up. On 
Earth it took years to forget an 
incident or to lose a skill. Here 
it happened overnight. 

He tried to sleep and couldn't. 
He finally got up and dressed 
and went down the stairs, out 
the lock into the alien night. 

A low voice asked, "That you, 
Ira?" 

"It's me, Bat Ears. I couldn't 
sleep. I'm worried." 

"You're always worried," Bat 
Ears. "It's an occu . . . occu . . ." 

"Occupational?" 

"That's it," said Bat Ears, tficcoughing just a little. "That's the 
word I wanted. Worry is an occupational disease with you." 

"We're in a jam, Bat Ears." 

"There's been planets," Bat 
Ears said, "I wouldn't of minded 
so much being marooned on, but 
this ain't one of them. This here 
place is the tail end of creation." 

They stood together in the 
darkness with the sweep of alien 
stars above them and the silent 
planet stretching off to a vague 
horizon. 

"There's something here," Bat 
Ears went on. "You can smell it 
in the air. Them fancy-pants in 
there said there wasn't nothing 
here because they couldn't see 
nothing and the books they'd 
read said nothing much could 
live on a planet that was just 
rocks and moss. But, me, I've 
seen planets. Me, I was planet

checking when most of them was 
in diapers and my nose can tell 
me more about a planet than 
their brains all lumped together, 
which, incidentally, ain't a bad 
idea." 

"I think you're right," confessed Warren. "I can feel it myself. 
I couldn't before. Maybe it's just 
because we're scared that we can 
feel it now." 

"I felt it before I was scared." 

"We should have looked 



138 





around. That's where we made 
our mistake. But there was so 
much work to do in the junkyard 
that we never thought of it." 

"Mac took a little jaunt," said 
Bat Ears. "Says he found some 
towers." 

"He told me about them, too." 

"Mac was just a little green 
around the gills when he was telling me." 

"He told me he didn't like 
them." 



139 



"If there was any place to run 
to, Mac would be running right 
now." 

"In the morning," Warren said, 
"we'll go and see those towers." 

IX 

T^HEY were towers, all right, 
and there were eight of them 
in line, like watch towers that at 
one time had stretched across the 
planet, but something had happened and all the others had been 
leveled except the eight that were 
standing there. 

They were built of undressed 
native rock, crudely piled, without mortar and with little wedges 
and slabs of stone used in the 
interstices to make the stones set 
solid. They were the kind of towers that might have been built 
by a savage race and they had an 
ancient look about them. They 
were about six feet at the base 
and tapered slightly toward the 
top and each of them was capped 
by a huge flat stone with an enormous boulder placed upon the 
slab to hold it in its place. 

Warren said to Ellis, "This is 
your department. Take over." 

The little archeologist didn't 
answer. He walked around the 
nearest tower and went up close 
to it and examined it. He put out 
his hands and acted as if he 
meant to shake the tower, but it 
didn't shake. 



"Solid," he said. "Well built 
and old." 

"Type F culture, I jvould say," 
guessed Spencer. 

"Maybe less than that. No attempt at an esthetic effect — pure 
utility. But good craftsmanship." 

Clyne said, "Its purpose is the 
thing. What were the towers 
built for?" 

"Storage space," said Spencer. 

"A marker," Lang contradicted. "A claim marker, a cache 
marker . . ." 

"We can find the purpose," 
Warren said. "That is something 
we needn't argue nor speculate 
about. All we have to do is knock 
off the boulder and lift the cap 
and have a look inside." 

He strode up to the tower and 
started climbing it. 

It was an easy thing to climb, 
for there were niches in the stones 
and hand and toe holds were not 
too hard to find. 

He reached the top. 

"Look out below," he yelled, 
and heaved at the boulder. 

It rolled and then slowly settled back. He braced himself and 
heaved again and this time it 
toppled. It went plunging off the 
tower, smashed to the ground, 
went rumbling down the slope, 
gathering speed, hitting other 
boulders in its path, zigzagging 
with the deflection of its course, 
thrown high into the air by the 
boulders that it hit. 



140 




 



WARREN said, "Throw a 
rope up to me. I'll fasten it 
to the capstone and then we can 
haul it off." 

"We haven't got a rope," said 
Clyne. 

"Someone run back to the ship 
and get one. I'll wait here till he 
returns." 

Briggs started back toward the 
ship. 

Warren straightened up. From 
the tower he had a fine view of 
the country and he swiveled slowly, examining it. 

Somewhere nearby, he thought, 
the men — well, not men, but the 
things that built these towers — 
must have had their dwelling. 
Within a mile or so there had 
been at one time a habitation. 
For the towers would have taken 
time in building and that meant 
that the ones who built them 
must have had at least a semipermanent location. 

But there was nothing to see — 
nothing but tumbled boulder 
fields and great outcroppings and 
the blankets of primal plants 
that ran across their surfaces. 

What did they live on? Why 
were they here? What would have 
attracted them? What would 
have held them here? 

He halted in his pivoting, 
scarcely believing what he saw. 
Carefully he traced the form of 
it, making sure that the light on 
some boulder field was not be


fuddling his vision. 

It couldn't be, he told himself. 
It couldn't happen three times. 
He must be wrong. 

He sucked in his breath and 
held it and waited for the illusion to go away. 

It didn't go away. The thing 
was there. 

"Spencer," he called. "Spencer, 
please come up here." 

He continued watching it. Below him, he heard Spencer scrabbling up the tower. He reached 
down a hand and helped him. 

"Look," Warren said, pointing. 
"What is that out there?" 

"A ship!" cried Spencer. 
"There's another ship out there!" 

'T'HE spaceship was old, incredibly old. It was red with rust; 
you could put your hand against 
its metal hide and sweep your 
hand across it and the flakes of 
rust would rain down upon the 
rock and your hand would come 
away painted with rust. 

The airlock once had been 
closed, but someone or something 
had battered a hole straight 
through it without opening it, 
for the rim was still in place 
against the hull and the jagged 
hole ran to the ship's interior. 
For yards around the lock, the 
ground was red with violently 
scattered rust. 

They clambered through the 
hole. Inside, the ship was bright 



JUNKYARD 



141 



and shining, without a trace of 
rust, although there was a coating of dust over everything. 
Through the dust upon the floor 
was a beaten track and many isolated footprints where the owners 
of the prints had stepped out of 
the path. They were alien tracks, 
with a heavy heel and three 
great toes, for all the world like 
the tracks of a mighty bird or 
some long-dead dinosaur. 

The trail led through the ship 
back to the engine room and 
there the empty platform stood, 
with the engines gone. 

"That's how they got away," 
said Warren, "the ones who 
junked their engines. They took 
the engines off this ship and put 
them in their ship and then they 
took off." 

"But they wouldn't know — " 
argued Clyne. 

"They evidently did," Warren 
interrupted bluntly. 

Spencer said, "They must have 
been the ones. This ship has been 
here for a long time — the rust 
will tell you that. And it was 
closed, hermetically sealed, because there's no rust inside. That 
hole was punched through the 
lock fairly recently and the engines taken." 

"That means, then," said Lang, 
"that they did junk their engines. 
They ripped them out entire and 
heaved them in the junkpile. 
They tore them out and replaced 



them with the engines from this 
ship." 

"But why?" asked Clyne. 
"Why did they have to do it?" 

"Because," said Spencer, "they 
didn't know how to operate their 
own engines." 

"But if they didn't know how 
to operate their engines, how 
could they run this one?" 

"TTE'S got you there," said 
Dyer. "That's one' that you 
can't, answer." 

"No, I can't," shrugged Warren. "But I wish I could, because 
then we'd have the answer ourselves." 

"How long ago," asked Spencer, "would you say this ship 
landed here? How long would it 
take for a spaceship hull to rust?" 

"It's hard to tell," Slyne answered. "It would depend on the 
kind of metal they used. But you 
can bet on this — any spaceship 
hull, no matter who might have 
built it, would be the toughest 
metal the race could fabricate." 

"A thousand years?" Warren 
suggested. 

"I don't know," said Clyne. 
"Maybe a thousand years. Maybe more than that. You see this 
dust. That's what's left of whatever organic material there was 
in the ship. If the beings that 
landed here remained within the 
ship, they still are here in the 
form of dust." 



142 




 



Warren tried to think, tried to 
sort out the chronology of the 
whole thing. 

A thousand years ago, or thousands of years ago, a spaceship 
had landed here and had not got 
away. 

Then another spaceship landed, 
a thousand or thousands of years 
later, and it, too, was unable to 
get away. But it finally escaped 
when the crew robbed the first 
ship of its engines and substituted 
them for the ones that had 
brought it here. 

Then years, or months, or days 
later, the Earth survey ship had 
landed here and it, too, couldn't 
get away — because the men who 
ran it couldn't remember how to 
operate its engines. 

He swung around and strode 
from the engine room, leaving the 
others there, following the path in 
the dust back to the shattered 
lock. 

And just inside the port, sitting 
on the floor, making squiggles 
in the dust with an awkward 
finger, sat Briggs, who had gone 
back to the ship to get a length 
of rope. 

"Briggs," said Warren sharply. 
"Briggs, what are you doing 
here?" 

Briggs looked up with vacant, 
laughing eyes. 

"Go away," he said. 

Then he went back to making 
squiggles in the dust. 



XI 

T\OC SPEARS said, "Briggs 
reverted to childhood. His 
mind is wiped as clean as a oneyear-old's. He can talk, which is 
about the only difference between 
a child and him. But his vocabulary is limited and what he says 
makes very little sense." 

"He can be taught again?" 
asked Warren. 

*'I don't know." 

"Spencer had a look at him. 
What does Spencer say?" 

"Spencer said a lot," Doc told 
him. "It adds up, substantially, 
to practically total loss of memory." 

"What can we do?" 

"Watch him. See he doesn't 
get hurt. After a while we might 
try re-education. He may even 
pick up some things by himself. 
Something happened to him. 
Whether whatever it was that 
took his memory away also injured his brain is something I 
can't say for sure. It doesn't appear injured, but without a lot of 
diagnostic equipment we don't 
have, you can't be positive." 

"There's no sign of injury?" 

"There's not a single mark 
anywhere," said Doc. "He isn't 
hurt. That is, not physically. It's 
only his mind that's been injured. 
Maybe not his mind, either — just 
his memory gone." 

"Amnesia?" 



JUNKYARD 



143 



"Not amnesia. When you have 
that, you're confused. You are 
haunted by the thought that you 
have forgotten something. You're 
all tangled up. Briggs isn't confused or tangled. He seems to be 
happy enough." 

"You'll take care of him, Doc? 
Kind of keep an eye on him?" 

Doc snorted and got up and 
left. 

Warren called after him, "If 
you see Bat Ears down there, tell 
him to come up." 

Doc clumped down the stairs. 

Warren sat and stared at the 
blank wall opposite him. 

First Mac and his crew had 
forgotten how to run the engines. 
That was the first sign of what 
was happening — the first recognizable sign — for it had been, going on long before Mac found 
he'd forgotten all his engine lore. 

The crew of investigators had 
lost some of their skills and their 
knowledge almost from the first. 
How else could one account for 
the terrible mess they'd made of 
the junkyard business? Under 
ordinary circumstances, they 
would have wrung some substantial information from the engine 
parts and the neatly stacked supplies. They had gotten information of a sort, of course, but it 
added up to nothing. Under ordinary circumstances, it should 
have added up to an extraordinary something. 



He heard feet coming up the 
stairs, but the tread was too 
crisp for Bat Ears. 

It was Spencer. 

OPENCER flopped into one of 
^ the chairs. He sat there opening and closing his hands, looking 
down at them w*ith helpless anger. 

"Well?" asked Warren. "Anything to report?" 

"Briggs got into that first tower," said Spencer. "Apparently 
he came back with the rope and 
found us gone, so he climbed up 
and threw a hitch around the capstone, then climbed down again 
and pulled it off. The capstone is 
lying on the ground, at the foot 
of the tower, with the rope still 
hitched around it." 

Warren nodded. "He could 
have done that. The capstone 
wasn't too heavy. One man could 
have pulled it off." 

"There's something in that 
tower." 

"You took a look?" 

"After what happened to 
Briggs? Of course not. I posted 
a guard to keep everyone away. 
We can't go monkeying around 
with the tower until we've 
thought a few things through." 

"What do you think is in 
there?" 

"I don't know," said Spencer. 
"All I have is an idea. We know 
what it can do. It can strip your 
memory." 



144 




 



"Maybe it's fright that did it," 
Warren said. "Something down 
in the tower so horrible . . ." 

Spencer shook his head. "There 
is no evidence of fright in Briggs. 
He's calm. Sits there happy as a 
clam, playing with his fingers 
and talking silly sentences — happy sentences. The way a kid 
would talk." 

"Maybe what he's saying will 
give us a hint. Keep someone listening all the time. Even if the 
words don't mean much . . ." 

"It wouldn't do any good. Not 
only is his memory gone, but even 
the memory of what took it 
away." 

"What do you plan to do?" 

"Try to get into the tower," 
said Spencer. "Try to find out 
what's in there. There must be a 
way of getting at whatever is 
there and coming out okay." 

"Look," Warren stated^ "we 
have enough as it is." 

"I have a hunch." 

"This is the first time I've ever 
heard you use that word. You 
gents don't operate on hunches. 
You operate on fact." 

Spencer put up an outspread 
hand and wiped it across his face. 

"I don't know what's the matter with me, Warren. I know I've 
never thought in hunches before. 
Perhaps because now I can't help 
myself, the hunch comes in and 
fills the place of knowledge that 
I've lost." 



"You admit there's been knowledge lost?" 

"Of course I do," said Spencer. 
"You were right about the junkyard. We should have done a 
better job." 

"And now you have a hunch." 

"TT'S crazy," said Spencer. "At 
least, it sounds crazy. That 
memory, that lost knowledge and 
lost skill went somewhere. Maybe 
there's something in the tower 
that took it away. I have the silly 
feeling we might get it back again, 
take it back from the thing that 
has it." 

He looked challengingly at 
Warren. "You think I'm cracked." 

Warren shook his head. "No, 
not that. Just grasping at straws." 

Spencer got up heavily. "I'll do 
what I can. I'll talk with the 
others. We'll try to think it out 
before we try anything." 

When he had gone, Warren 
buzzed the engine room communicator. 

Mac's voice came reedily out 
of the box. 

"Having any luck, Mac?" 

"None at all," Mac told him. 
"We sit and look at the engines. 
We are going out of our heads 
trying to remember." 

"I guess that's all you can do, 
Mac." 

"We could mess around with 
them, but I'm afraid if we do, 
we'll get something out of kilter." 



JUNKYARD 



145 



"Keep your hands off everything," commanded Warren in 
sudden alarm. "Don't touch a 
single thing. God knows what 
you might do." 

"We're just sitting," Mac said, 
"and looking at the engines and 
trying to remember." 

Crazy, thought Warren. 

Of course it was crazy. 

Down there were men trained to 
operate spaceship engines, men 
who had lived and slept with 
engines for year on lonesome year. 
And now they sat and looked at 
engines and wondered how to 
run them. 

Warren got up from his desk 
and went slowly down the stairs. 

In the cook's quarters, he 
found Bat Ears. 

Bat Ears had fallen off a chair 
and was fast asleep upon the 
floor, breathing heavily. The room 
reeked with liquor fumes. An almost empty bottle sat upon the 
table. 

Warren reached out a foot and 
prodded Bat Ears gently. Bat 
Ears moaned a little in his sleep. 

Warren picked up the bottle 
and held it to the light. There 
was one good, long drink. 

He tilted the bottle and took 
the drink, then hurled the empty 
bottle against the wall. The broken plastiglass sprayed in a 
shower down on Bat Ears' head. 

Bat Ears raised a hand and 
brushed it off, as if brushing 



away a fly. Then he slept on, 
smiling, with his mind comfortably drugged against memories 
he no longer had. 

XII 

'T'HEY covered the tower with 
the capstone once again and 
rigged a tripod and pulley above 
it. Then they took the capstone 
off and used the pulley to lower 
an automatic camera into the pit 
and they got their pictures. 

There was something in the 
tower, all right. 

They spread the pictures out 
on the table in the mess room 
and tried to make out what they 
had. 

It was shaped like a watermelon or an egg " stood on one end 
with the lower end slightly mashed so that it would stand upright. 
It sprouted tiny hairs all over 
and some of the hairs were blurred in the pictures, as if they 
might have been vibrating. There 
was tubing and what seemed to 
be wiring, even if it didn't look 
exactly the way you thought of 
wiring, massed around the lower 
end of the egg. 

They made other tests, lowering the instruments with the pulley, and they determined that 
the egg was alive and that it was 
the equivalent of a warm-blooded 
animal, although they were fairly sure that its fluids would not 



146 




 



be identical with blood. 

It was soft and unprotected by 
any covering shell and it pulsed 
and gave out some sort of vibrations. They couldn't determine 
what sort of vibrations. The little 
hairs that covered it were continually in motion. 

They put the capstone back in 
place again, but left the tripod 
and the pulley standing. 

Howard, the biologist, said, 
"It's alive and it's an organism 
of some kind, but I'm not at all 
convinced that it's pure animal. 
Those wires and that piping lead 
straight into it, as if, you'd almost swear, the piping and the 
wires were a part of it. And look 
at these - - what would you call 
them? — these studs, almost like 
connections for other wires." 

"It's not inconceivable," said 
Spencer, "that an animal and a 
mechanism should be joined together. Take Man and his machines. Man and the machines 
work together, but Man maintains his individual identity and 
the machines maintain their own. 
In a lot of cases it would make 
more sense, economically, if not 
socially, that Man and machine 
should be one, that the two of 
them be joined together, become, 
in face, one organism." 

Dyer said, "I think that may be 
what we have here." 

"Those other towers?" asked 
Ellis. 



"They could be connected," 
Spencer suggested, "associated in 
some way. All eight of them 
could be, as a matter of principle, 
one complex organism." 

"We don't know what's in those 
other towers," said Ellis. 

"We could find out," Howard 
answered. 

"No, we can't," objected Spencer. "We don't dare. We've fooled 
around with them more than was 
safe. Mac and his crew went for 
a walk and found the towers and 
examined them, just casually, 
you understand, and they came 
back not knowing how to operate 
the engines. We can't take the 
chance of fooling around with 
them a minute longer than is 
necessary. Already we may have 
lost more than we suspect." 

"You mean," said Clyne, 
"that the loss of memory we may 
have experienced will show up 
later? That we may not know 
now we've lost it, but will find 
later that we did?" 

OPENCER nodded. "That's 
^ what happened to Mac. He 
or any member of his crew, would 
have sworn, up to the minute 
that they tried to start the engines, that they could start them. 
They took it for granted, just as 
we take our knowledge for granted. Until we come to use the 
specific knowledge we have lost, 
we won't realize we've lost it."

"It scares you just to think 
about it," Howard said. 

Lang said, "It's some sort of 
communications system." 

"Naturally you'd think so. 
You're a communications man." 

"Those wires." 

"And what about the pipes?" 
asked Howard. 

"I have a theory on that one," 
Spencer told them. "The pipes 
supply the food." 

"Attached to some food supply," said Clyne. "A tank of food 
buried in the ground." 

"More likely roots," Howard 
put in. "To talk of tanks of food 
would mean these are transplanted things. They could just as 
easily be native to this planet." 

"They couldn't have built those 
towers," said Ellis. "If they were 
native, they'd had to build those 
towers themselves. Something or 
someone else built the towers, 
like a farmer builds a barn to 
protect his cattle. I'd vote for 
tanks of food." 

Warren spoke for the first 
time. "What makes you think 
it's a communications setup?" 

Lang shrugged. "Nothing specific. Those wires, I guess, and 
the studs. It looks like a communications rig." 

"Communications might fill 
the bill," Spencer nodded. "But 
a communications machine built 
to take in information rather 
than to pass information along or 



disseminate it." 

"What are you getting at?" demanded Lang. "How would that 
be communication?" 

"I mean," said Spencer, "that 
something has been robbing us of 
our memory. It stole our ability 
to run the engines and it took 
enough knowledge away from us 
so we bungled the junkyard job." 

"It couldn't be that," said 
Dyer. 

"Why couldn't it?" asked 
Clyne. 

"It's just too damn fantastic." 

""[VTO more fantastic," Spencer 
^ ^ told him, "than a lot of 
other things we've found. Say 
that egg is a device for gathering 
knowledge . . ." 

"But there's no knowledge to 
gather here," protested Dyer. 
"Thousands of years ago, there 
was knowledge to gather from 
the rusted ship out there. And 
then, just a while ago, there was 
knowledge to gather from the 
junkyard ship. And now there's 
us. But the next shipload of 
knowledge won't come along for 
maybe uncounted thousands of 
years. It's too long to wait, too 
big a gamble. Three ships we 
know of have come here; it 
would be just as reasonable to 
suppose that no ship would ever 
come here. It doesn't make any 
sense." 

"Who said that the knowledge 



148 




 



had to be collected here? Even 
back on Earth we forget, don't 
we?" 

"Good Lord!" gasped Clyne, 
but Spencer rushed ahead. 

"If you were some race setting 
out fish traps for knowledge and 
had plenty of time to gather it, 
where would you put your traps? 
On a planet that swarmed with 
sentient beings, where the traps 
might be found and destroyed or 
their secrets snatched away? Or 
would you put them on some uninhabited, out-of-the-way planet, 
some second-rate world that 
won't be worth a tinker's dam to 
anyone for another billion years?" 

Warren said, "I'd put them on 
a planet just like this." 

"Let me give you the picture," 
Spencer continued. "Some race 
is bent on trapping knowledge 
throughout the Galaxy. So they 
hunt up the little, insignificant, 
good-for-nothing planets where 
they can hide their traps. That 
way, with traps planted on strategically spaced planets, they 
sweep all space and there's little 
chance that their knowledge traps 
ever will be found." 

"You think that's what we've 
found here?" asked Clyne. 

"I'm tossing you the idea," 
said Spencer, "to see what you 
think of it. Now let's hear your 
comments." 

"Well, the distance, for one 
thing—" 



"What we have here," said 
Spencer, "is mechanical telepathy 
hooked up with a recording device. We know that distance has 
little to do with the speed of 
thought waves." 

"There's no other basis for this 
belief beyond speculation?" asked 
Warren. 

"What else can there be? You 
certainly can't expect proof. We 
don't dare to get close enough to 
find out what this egg is. And 
maybe, even if we could, we 
haven't got enough knowledge 
left in us to make an intelligent 
decision or a correct deduction." 

"So we guess again," said Warren. 

"Have you some better method?" 

Warren shook his head. "No, 
I don't think I have." 

XIII 

T"\YER put on a spacesuit, with 
a rope running from it to 
the pulley in the tripod set above 
the tower. He carried wires to 
connect to the studs. The other 
ends of the wires were connected 
to a dozen different instruments 
to see what might come over 
them — if anything. 

Dyer climbed the tower and 
they lowered him down into the 
inside of the tower. Almost immediately, he quit talking to 
them, so they pulled him out. 



JUNKYARD 



149 



When they loosened the spacesuit helmet and hinged it back, 
he gurgled and blew bubbles at 
them. 

Old Doc gently led him back 
to sick bay. 

Clyne and Pollard worked for 
hours designing a lead helmet 
with television installed instead 
of vision plates. Howard, the biologist, climbed inside the spacesuit and was lowered into the 
tower. 

When they hauled him out a 
minute later, he was crying — like 
a child. Ellis hurried him after 
Old Doc and Dyer, with Howard 
clutching his hands and babbling 
between sobs. 

After ripping the television 
unit out of the helmet, Pollard 
was all set to go in the helmet 
made of solid lead when Warren 
put a stop to it. 

"You keep this up much longer," he told them, "and we'll 
have no one left." 

"This one has a chance of 
working," Clyne declared. » "It 
might have been the television 
lead-ins that let them get at 
Howard." 

"It has a chance of not working, too." 

"But we have to try." 

"Not until I say so." 

Pollard started to put the solid 
helmet on his head. 

"Don't put that thing on," said 
Warren. "You're not going any


where you'll be needing it." 

"I'm going in the tower," Pollard said flatly. 

Warren took a step toward him 
and without warning lashed out 
with his fist. It caught Pollard on 
the jaw and crumpled him. 

Warren turned to face the rest 
of them. "If there's anyone else 
who thinks he wants to argue, 
I'm ready to begin the discussion 
— in the same way." 

None of them wanted to argue. 
He could see the tired disgust 
for him written on their faces. 

Spencer said, "You're upset, 
Warren. You don't know what 
you're doing." 

"I know damned well what 
I'm doing," Warren retorted. "I 
know there must be a way to get 
into that tower and get out again 
with some of your memory left. 
But the way you're going about 
it isn't the right way." 

"You know another?" asked 
Ellis bitterly. 

"No, I don't," said Warren. 
"Not yet." 

"What do you want us to do?" 
demanded Ellis. "Sit around and 
twiddle our thumbs?" 

"I want you to behave like 
grown men," said Warren, "not 
like a bunch of crazy kids out to 
rob an orchard." 

He stood and looked at them 
and none of them had a word to 
say. 

"I have three mewling babies 



150 




 



on my hands right now," he added. "I don't want any more." 

He walked away, up the hill, 
heading for the ship. 

XIV 

''■''HEIR memory had been 
-■- stolen, probably by the egg 
that squatted in the tower. And 
although none of them had dared 
to say the thought aloud, the 
thing that all of them were thinking was that maybe there was a 
way to steal that knowledge back, 
to tap and drain all the rest of 
the knowledge that was stored 
within the egg. 

Warren sat at his desk and 
held his head in his hands, trying 
to think. 

Maybe he should have let 
them go ahead with what they 
had been doing. But if he had, 
they'd have kept right on, using 
variations of the same approach 
— and when the approach had 
failed twice, they should have 
figured out that approach was 
wrong and tried another. 

Spencer had said that they'd 
lost knowledge and not known 
they had lost it, and that was the 
insidious part of the whole situation. They still thought of themselves as men of science, and 
they were, of course, but not as 
skilled, not as knowledgable as 
•» they once had been. 

That was the hell of it — they 



still thought they were. 

They despised him now and 
that was all right with him. Anything was all right with him if it 
would help them discover a way 
to escape. 

Forgetfulness, he thought. All 
through the Galaxy, there was 
forgetfulness. There were explanations for that forgetfulness, 
very learned and astute theories 
on why a being should forget 
something it had learned. But 
might not all these explanations 
be wrong? Might it not be that 
forgetfulness could be traced, not 
to some kink within the brain, 
not to some psychic cause, but to 
thousands upon thousands of 
memory traps planted through 
the Galaxy, traps that tapped 
and drained and nibbled away at 
the mass memory of all the 
sentient beings which lived among 
the stars? 

On Earth a man would forget 
slowly over the span of many 
years and that might be because 
the memory traps that held Earth 
in their orbit were very far away. 
But here a man forgot completely and suddenly. Might that not 
be because he was within the 
very shadow of the memory 
traps? 

He tried to imagine Operation 
Mind Trap and it was a shocking 
concept too big for the brain to 
grasp. Someone came to the 
backwoods planets, the good-for


JUNKYARD 



151 



nothing planets, the sure-to-bepassed-by planets and set out 
the memory traps. 

They hooked them up in series 
and built towers to protect them 
from weather or from accident, 
t and set them operating and connected them to tanks of nutrients 
buried deep within the soil. Then 
they went away. 

And years later — how many 
years later, a thousand, ten thousand? — they came back again 
and emptied the traps of the 
knowledge they had gathered. As 
a trapper sets out traps to catch 
animals for fur, or a fisherman 
should set the pots for lobsters 
or drag the seine for fish. 

A harvest, Warren thought — a 
continual, never-ending harvest 
of the knowledge of the Galaxy. 

TF this were true, what kind of 
■■■ race would it be that set the 
traps? What kind of trapper 
would be plodding the starways, 
gathering his catch? 

Warren's reason shrank away 
from the kind of race that it 
would be. 

The creatures undoubtedly 
came back again, after many 
years, and emptied the traps of 
the knowledge they had snared. 
That must be what they'd do, 
for why otherwise would they 
bother to set out the traps? And 
if they could empty the traps of 
the knowledge they had caught, 



that meant there was some way 
to empty them. And if the trappers themselves could drain off 
the knowledge, so could another 
race. 

If you could only get inside the 
tower and have a chance to figure 
out the way, you could do the 
job, for probably it was a simple 
thing, once you had a chance to 
see it. But you couldn't get inside. 
If you did, you were robbed. of 
all memory and came out a 
squalling child. The moment you 
got inside, the egg grabbed onto 
your mind and wiped it clean 
and you didn't even know why 
you were there or how you'd got 
there or where you were. 

The trick was to get inside and 
still keep your memory, to get 
inside and still know what there 
was to do. 

Spencer and the others had 
tried shielding the brain and 
shielding didn't work. Maybe 
there was a way to make it work, 
but you'd have had to use trial 
and error methods and that 
meant too many men coming out 
with their memories gone before 
you had the answer. It meant 
that maybe in just a little while 
you'd have no men at all. 

There must be another way. 

When you couldn't shield a 
thing, what did you do? 

A communications problem, 
Lang had said. Perhaps Lang was m 
right — the egg was a communica


152 




 



tions setup. And what did you 
do to protect communications? 
When you couldn't shield a 
communication, what did you do 
with it? 

There was an answer to that 
one, of course — you scrambled it. 

But there was no solution 
there, nor any hint of a solution. 
He sat and listened and there was 
no sound. No one had stopped 
by to see him; no one had dropped in to pass the time of day. 

They're sore, he thought. 
They're off sulking in a corner. 
They're giving me the silent 
treatment. 

To hell with them, he said. 

He sat alone and tried to think 
and there were no thoughts, just 
a mad merry-go-round of questions revolving in his skull. 

Finally there were footsteps on 
the stairs and from their unsteadiness, he knew whose they were. 

It was Bat Ears coming up to 
comfort him and Bat Ears had a 
skin full. 

He waited, listening to the 
stumbling feet tramping up the 
stairs, and Bat Ears finally appeared. He stood manfully in the 
doorway, putting out both hands 
and bracing them against the 
jambs on either side of him to 
keep the place from swaying. 

T> AT EARS nerved himself and 
plunged across the space 
from doorway to chair and grab


bed the chair and hung onto it 
and wrestled himself into it and 
looked up at Warren with a 
smirk of triumph. 

"Made it," Bat Ears said. 

"You're drunk," snapped Warren disgustedly. 

"Sure, I'm drunk. It's lonesome 
being drunk all by yourself. 
Here . . ." 

He found his pocket and hauled the bottle out and set it gingerly on the desk. 

"There you are," he said. "Let's 
you and me go and hang one on." 

Warren stared at the bottle and 
listened to the little imp of 
thought that jigged within his 
brain. 

"No, it wouldn't work." 

"Cut out the talking and start 
working on that jug. When you 
get through with that one, I got 
another hid out." 

"Bat Ears," said Warren. 

"What do you want?" asked 
Bat Ears. "I never saw a man 
that wanted — " 

"How much more have you 
got?" 

"How much more what, Ira?" 

"Liquor. How much more do 
you have stashed away?" 

"Lots of it. I always bring 
along a marg ... a marg . . ." 

"A margin?" 

"That's right," said Bat Ears. 
"That is what I meant. I always 
figure what I need and then bring 
along a margin just in case we 



JUNKYARD 



153 



get marooned or something." 

Warren reached out and took 
the bottle. He uncorked it and 
threw the cork away. 

"Bat Ears," he said, "go and 
get another bottle." 

Bat Ears blinked at him. 
"Right away, Ira? You mean 
right away?" 

"Immediately," said Warren. 
"And on your way, would you 
stop and tell Spencer that I want 
to see him soon as possible?" 

Bat Ears wobbled to his feet. 

He regarded Warren with 
forthright admiration. 

"What you planning on doing, 
Ira?" he demanded. 

"I'm going to get drunk," said 
Warren. "I'm going to hang one 
on that will make history in the 
survey fleet." 

XV 

'"Y^OU can't do it, man," pro-■- tested Spencer. "You haven't 
got a chance." 

Warren put out a hand against 
the tower and tried to hold himself a little steadier, for the whole 
planet was gyrating at a fearful 
pace. 

"Bat Ears," Warren called out. 
"Yes, Ira." 

"Shoot the — hie — man who 
tries to shtop me." 

"I'll do that, Ira," Bat Ears 
assured him. 

"But you're going in there un


protected," Spencer said anxiously. "Without even a spacesuit." 

"I'm trying out a new appro 
. . . appro . . ." 

"Approach?" supplied Bat 
Ears. 

"Thash it," said Warren. "I 
thank you, Bat Ears. Thash exactly what I'm doing." 

Lang said, "It's got a chance. 
We tried to shield ourselves and 
it didn't work. He's trying a new 
approach. He's scrambled up his 
mind with liquor. I think he 
might have a chance." 

"The shape he's in," said Spencer, "he'll never get the wires 
connected." 

Warren wobbled a little. "The 
hell you shay." 

He stood and blurredly watched them. Where there had been 
three of each of them before, 
there now, in certain cases, were 
only two of them. 

"Bat Ears." 

"Yes, Ira." 

"I need another drink. It's 
wearing off a little." 

Bat Ears took the bottle from 
his pocket and handed it across. 
It was not quite half full. Warren 
tipped it up and drank, his 
Adam's apple bobbing. He did 
not quit drinking until the last of 
it was gone. He let the bottle 
drop and looked at them again. 
This time there were three of each 
of them and it was all right. 

He turned to face the tower. 



154 




 



"Now," he said, "if you gen'men will jush — " 

Ellis and Clyne hauled on the 
rope and Warren sailed into the 
air. 

"Hey, there!" he shouted. 
"Wha' you trying to do?" 

He had forgotten about the 
pulley rigged on the tripod above 
the tower. 

He dangled in the air, kicking 
and trying to get his balance, 
with the blackness of the tower's 
mouth looming under him and a 
funny, shining glow at the bottom 
of it. 

Above him the pulley creaked 
and he shot down and was inside 
the tower. 

He could see the thing at the 
bottom now. He hiccoughed politely and told it to move over, 
he was coming down. It didn't 
move an inch. Something tried to 
take his head off and it didn't 
come off. 

The earphones said, "Warren, 
you all right? You all right? Talk 
to us." 

"Sure," he said. "Sure, all right. 
Wha' matter wish you?" 

npHEY let him down and he 
stood beside the funny thing 
that pulsated in the pit. He felt 
something digging at his brain 
and laughed aloud, a gurgling, 
drunken laugh. 

"Get your handsh out my 
hair," he said. "You tickle." 



"Warren," said the earphones. 
"The wires. The wires. You remember, we talked about the 
wires." 

"Sure," he said. "The wires." 

There were little studs on the 
pulsating thing and they'd be fine 
things to attach a wire to. 

Wires? What the hell were 
wires? 

"Hooked on your belt," said 
the earphones. "The wires are 
hooked on your belt." 

His hand moved to his belt and 
he found the wires. He fumbled 
with them and they slipped out 
of his fingers and he got down 
and scrabbled around and grabbed hold of them again. They 
were all tangled up and he couldn't make head or tail of them and 
what was he messing around with 
wires for, anyhow? 

What he wanted was another 
drink — another little drink. 

He sang: "I'm a rambliri wreck 
from Georgia Tech and a hell of 
an engineer.'" 

He said to the egg: "Friend, 
I'd be mosh pleashed if you'd 
join me in a drink." 

The earphones said, "Your 
friend can't drink until you get 
those wires hooked up. He can't 
hear without the wires hooked up. 
He can't tell what you're saying 
until you get those wires hooked 
up. 

"You understand, Warren? 
Hook up the wires. He can't hear 



JUNKYARD 



155 



till you do." 

"Now, thash too bad," said 
Warren. "Thash an awful thing." 

He did the best he could to get 
the wires hooked up and he told 
his new friend just to be patient 
and hold still, he was doing the 
best he could. He yelled for Bat 
Ears to hurry with the bottle and 
he sang a ditty which was quite 
obscene. And finally he got the 
wires hooked up, but the man in 
the earphones said that wasn't 
right, to try it once again. He 
changed the wires around some 
more and they still weren't right, 
and so he changed them around 
again, until the man in the earphones said, "That's fine! We're 




getting something now!" 

And then someone hauled him 
out of there before he even had 
a drink with his pal. 

XVI 

TIE stumbled up the stairs and 
negotiated his way around 
the desk and plopped into the 
chair. Someone had fastened a 
steel bowl securely over the top 
half of his head and two men, 
or possibly three, were banging 
it with hammer, and his mouth 
had a wool blanket wadded up in 
it, and he could have sworn that 
at any moment he'd drop dead 
of thirst. 




He heard footsteps on the stairs 
and hoped that it was Bat Ears, 
for Bat Ears would know what to 
do. 

But it was Spencer. 
"How're you feeling?" Spencer 
asked. 

"Awful," Warren groaned. 

"You turned the trick!" 

"That tower business?" 

"You hooked up the wires," 
said Spencer, "and the stuff is 
rolling out. Lang has a recorder 
hooked up and we're taking turns 
listening in and the stuff we're 
getting is enough to set your 
teeth on edge." 

"Stuff?" 

"Certainly. The knowledge that 
mind trap has been collecting. 
It'll take us years to sort out all 
the knowledge and try to correlate it. Some of it is just in 
snatches and some of it is fragmentary, but we're getting lots 
of it in hunks." 

"Some of our own stuff being 
fed back to us?" 

"A little. But mostly alien." 

"Anything on the engines?" 

Spencer hesitated. "No, not on 
our engines. That is — " 

"Well?" 

"We got the dope on the junkyard engine. Pollard's already at 
work. Mac and the boys are helping him get it assembled." 

"It'll work?" 

"Better than what we have. 
We'll have to modify our tubes 



JUNKYARD 



157 



and make some other changes." 

"And you're going to — " 

Spencer nodded. "We're ripping out our engines." 

Warren couldn't help it. He 
couldn't have helped it if he'd 
been paid a .million dollars. He 
put his arms down on the desk 
and hid his face in them and 
shouted raucously with incoherent 
laughter. 

After a time he looked up again 
and mopped at laughter-watered 
eye* 

"I fail to see — " Spencer began 
stiffly. 

"Another junkyard," Warren 
said. "Oh, God, another junkyard!" 

"It's not so funny, Warren. It's 
brain-shaking — a mass of knowledge such as no one ever dreamed 
of. Knowledge that had been accumulating for years, maybe a 
thousand years. Ever since that 
other race came and emptied the 
trap and then went away again." 

"T OOK," said Warren, "couldn't 
we wait until we came across 
the knowledge of our engines? 
Surely it will come out soon. 
It went in, was fed in, whatever you want to call it, later 
than any of the rest of this stuff 
you are getting. If we'd just wait, 
we'd have the knowledge that we 
lost. We wouldn't have to go to 
all the work of ripping out the 
engines and replacing them." 



SPENCER shook his head. 
"Lang figured it out. There 
seems to be no order or sequence 
in the way we get the information. The chances are that we • 
might have to wait for a long, 
long time. We have no way of 
knowing how long the information will keep pouring out. Lang 
thinks for maybe years. But 
there's something else. We've got 
to get away as soon as possible." 

"What's the matter with you, 
Spencer?" 

"I don't know." 
"You're afraid of something. 
Something's got you scared." 

Spencer bent over and grasped 
the desk edge with his hands, 
hanging on. 

"Warren, it's not only knowledge in that thing. We're monitoring it and we know. There's 
also — " 

"I'll take a guess," said Warren. "There's personality." 

He saw the stricken look on 
Spencer's face. 

"Quit monitoring it," ordered 
Warren sharply. "Turn the whole 
thing off. Let's get out of here." 

"We can't. Don't you understand? We can't! There are certain points. We are — " 

"Yes, I know," said Warren. . 
"You are men of science. Also 
downright fools." 

"But there are things coming 
out of that tower that — ''' 

"Shut it off!" 



158 




 



"No," said Spencer obstinately. 
"I can't. I won't." 

"I warn you," Warren said 
grimly, "if any of you turn alien, 
I'll shoot you without hesitation." 

"Don't be a fool." Spencer 
turned sharply about and went 
out the door. 

Warren sat, sober now, listening to Spencer's feet go down the 
steps. 

It was all very clear to Warren 
now. 

Now he knew why there had 
been evidence of haste in that 
other ship's departure, why supplies had been left behind and 
tools still lying where they had 
been dropped as the crew had 
fled. 

After a while Bat Ears came 
up the stairs, lugging a huge pot 
of coffee and a couple of cups. 

He set the cups down on the 
desk and filled them, then banged 
down the pot. 

"Ira," he said, "it was a black 
day when you gave up your 
drinking." 

"How is that?" asked Warren. 

"Because there ain't no one, 
nowhere, who can hang one on 
like you." 




HEY sat silently, gulping the 
hot, black coffee. 



Then Bat Ears said, "I still 
don't like it." 

"Neither do I," admitted Warren. 

"The cruise is only half over," 
said Bat Ears. 

"The cruise is completely 
over," Warren told him bluntly. 
"When we lift out of here, we're 
heading straight for Earth." 

They drank more coffee. 

Warren asked: "How many on 
our side, Bat Ears?" 

"There's you and me," said Bat 
Ears, "and Mac and the four engineers. That's seven." 

"Eight," corrected Warren. 
"Don't forget Doc. He hasn't been 
doing any monitoring." 

"Doc don't count for nothing 
one way or the other." 

"In a pinch, he still can handle 
a gun." 

After Bat Ears had gone, Warren sat and listened to the sound 
of Mac's crew ripping out the 
engines and he thought of the 
long way home. Then he got up 
and strapped on a gun and went 
out to see how things were shaping up.
