THE WAV OF A WEEB by H. B. Hictey 

Illustrated by Robert Gibson Jones 

It look a frightened little creature from 
Jupiter to f each these Earthmen a new twist 
to the adage: Death makes cowards of us all 



ACROSS the fringes of planetary space the ship of the line 
Virtus flung itself with comet 
speed and a comet tail of atomic flame 
from undamped motors. And huddled 
against a bulkhead sat Dimpo the 
Weeb, his three foot pipestem body 
shaken by sobs, his long ears droop


ing dismally over his thin cheeks, his 
huge, soulful brown eyes gushing oily 
blue tears. 

Ensign Fuller, passing through, saw 
him and heard him and screwed up 
his face in contempt. 

"What're you crying about now, 
Weeb?" Fuller demanded.

"I'm afraid," Dimpo wailed in his 
high, thin voice. 

"Afraid? Of what?" 

"I don't know. Just afraid." 

"There is nothing to be afraid of," 
Fuller told him. "You are on the newest and finest type of ship in the Earth 
Fleet. There is not the slightest chance 
of our being overtaken or attacked by 
a ship of Pluto. You know that much, 
don't you?" 

"Yes." 

"Yes sir, when addressing an officer of the Earth Fleet. You're not 
talking to one of those scraggy prospectors." 

"Yes sir," Dimpo said dutifully. 

"Dimpo—" Fuller paused, his porcine features set in a smirk. "It is 
Dimpo, isn't it? Tell me, what walks 
like a man but has the soul of a 
worm?" 

"A Weeb, sir." Dimpo's eyes were 
downcast. In their three days out he 
had learned the routine. 

"What is it that can swim but is 
afraid of water, that would rather eat 
its dead fellows than go out and 
hunt?" 

"A Weeb, sir." 

"In other words, Dimpo, what is 
the lowest thing in all Creation?" 
"A Weeb, sir." 

"Except for a spit and polish wonder fresh out of Mars Flight School," 
a new voice said. "Nothing is lower 
than that." 

Fuller whirled, his skin blotching 
with anger. It was Crag, one of the 
prospectors they'd hauled off Jupiter 
v. 

For an instant Fuller thought of 
swinging on Crag. But the graying, 
stoop-shouldered man watched him 
easily, gnarled hands that had swung 
a pick from the Asteroids past Saturn 
balled into hard fists. 

"A Weeb," Fuller grated. "A Weeb 
and five crumby rock knockers. And 



we had to swing twenty million mil«i 

off course for thatl" 

"If we'd known the company we'd 
be in we'd have stayed there," Crag 
said. 

This time Fuller was definitely 
going to swing on him. The burly ensign bulled forward and -Crag set himself, an expectantly pleasurable grjn 
on his face. He dropped the grin when 
beyond Fuller's shoulder the captain 
appeared. 

r\IMPO WAS trying very hard not 
to cry. Re couldn't help be*ng 
afraid, any more than any other W>eb 
could help it. And now, with the captain's hard eyes on him. Dimpo 
shrank back and sobbed harder. 

"I've had enough of this," Captain 
Mackey snapped. "Nothing but trouble ever since you fellows and that 
jonah came aboard!" 

The captain's nerves were on edge 
as it was. Caught too far out in space 
by the sneak auaek from Pluto, he 
was racing to beat a probable blockade. Stopping lo pick up the five prospectors hadn't been in his plans at 
all. 

His eyes flickered to a porthole. 
"I've got a good mind to— He's a 
stowaway anyhow. He'd never got on 
board in the first place, if we'd known 
about him." 

Glaring at Dimpo, he shouted, 
"What's he crying about?" 

"He's afraid," Crag said. 

"He ought to be. We'll be lucky to 
see Earth, with a Weeb aboard." 

"Hogwash," Crag said calmly. "We 
got him from Deimos to Jupiter v 
without a crackup." 

Mackey shuddered. "Ugh. How you 
can stand a thing like that is beyond 
me." 

He pushed past Crag and marched 
toward the control room, Fuller falling into step behind him. 

The prospector shook his head. 



THE WAY OF A WEEB 



131 



"See, Dimpo?" 

"I'm sorry/' Dimpo said. "You 
should have left me on Deimos, with 
the rest of the Weebs. I try to be 
brave, like a human, but I just can't." 

"It's your glands," Crag said. "You 
can't help being the way you are." 

"I thought I'd learn, but I guess I 
never will. You should have left me 
on Deimos." 

Which was exactly what Crag was 
thinking. What had ever possessed 
him and his companions to take off 
from the moon of Mars with a Weeb, 
he didn't know now. They'd been, 
he recalled, a little drunk at the time. 
It had seemed funny, when Dimpo 
begged to go, to take him along. 

"A human ,is brave," Dimpo said, 
repeating his catechism. "A human is 
never afraid." He turned his immense 
eyes on Crag. "You're not afraid, are 
you?" 

"What's there to be afraid of?" 
Crag demanded irritably. 

The ship swung over into a sudden 
steep dive that almost tore his guts 
out. 

QN THE DARK screen the points 
of light grew larger, one by one, 
until there were six of them in a neat 
pattern. Peering over the radarman's 
shoulder, Mackey said, "Bracket one 
for data." 

Five of the light spots vanished, the 
remaining one growing large and 
bright. 

"Thirty thousand tons, about our 
own weight," the radarman said. 
"Speed, five Mach absolute, one Mach 
relative. Vector—" 

"I can see the vector," Mackey 
said. He thought aloud, "Maybe we 
ought to take them on. No, I think 
not." 

To the pilot he said, "Two degrees 
left. We'll cut back and outrun them, 
all except the last, maybe." 

Behind him, huddled among the 



five prospectors, Dimpo heard his last 
words. 

"They're going to get us," Dimpo 
sobbed. "I know they will." 

Mackey whirled. "Get that damn 
jinx out of here!" he shouted. 

"See, Dimpo?" Crag said. He led 
Dimpo from the control room and sat 
down beside htm on a pile of gear. 

"They'll get us," Dimpo bleated 
mournfully, the tears coursing down 
his cheeks. "I'm afraid, Crag." 

Disgusted with Dimpo as he was, 
Crag could not help feeling sorry for 
the creature. Weeb or not, Dimpo had 
made a fairly pleasant pet and companion. He had done his best to make 
himself useful, even bringing in a few 
tiny animals for food. 

"Look," Crag said kindly. "Look, 
Dimpo. They can't get us. Really they 

"Honest?" 

"Sure. The only ships Pluto's got 
that could catch us are too small to 
hurt us. And the big ones are a little 
too slow." He paused, wanting to make 
this clear. "You see, Dimpo, it's oh 
account of the high density on Pluto. 
The big ships have a poor mass-thrust 
ratio when they're operating near a 
large planet." 

"I don't understand things like 
that," Dimpo wailed. "I only know 
how I feel." 

"Well, take my word for it." Then, 
to change the subject, "Say, how'd 
you ever sneak up on those little Jupe 
cats so you could kill them? I thought 
those things could hear a pin drop a 
mile away." 

Dimpo stopped crying. His thin 
chest swelled with pride. "I sneaked 
up. Weebs are good at sneaking up. 
We can make ourselves light." 

That much was true, Crag knew. 
He had seen Dimpo almost float above 
the ground on a low density planetoid. 

"I don't understand things like 



132 



 



that," he said, evening the score deliberately. 

"I sneaked up," Dimpo continued, 
beginning to dramatize. He brought 
out a tiny knife with a half-inch blade. 
"Then I stuck them!" 

Staring up at Crag with a gleeful 
grin, he said, "That was good, wasn't 
it?" 

"You bet." The Jupecats ran to 
four inches in length and had no claws, 
but why make Dimpo feel bad? 

Then Ensign Fuller had to come 
along again and glower at the Weeb. 
The tears came once more, with renewed force. 

iiT OOK," Crag said to the captain. 

"I know how you feel about 
Weebs. But we learned this much 
living with Dimpo: a Weeb's got intuition. If Dimpo feels this bad, something's going to happen." 

Beside him, Morris, another prospector, said, "No fooling, Captain." 

They had left Dimpo in the care 
of the other three, for which Mackey 
was thankful. He was no more superstitious than any other spaceman, but 
no less. 

"Those Pluto ships are acting funny, and that's a fact ," he admitted. 

In the last half hour the dark ships 
of Pluto had grown slightly larger on 
the screen, but not much. They were 
definitely not trying too hard to close 
for battle. And that fact, among others, was making Mackey suspicious. 

Pluto had less ships of the first line 
than Earth. Pluto's ships were slower 
and no better armed. Then why had 
Pluto declared war suddenly, not even 
trying to take advantage of a sneak 
attack? 

It didn't make sense, not to a man 
like Mackey, who knew how important even a five hundred mile an hour 
advantage could be. 

"Captain!" the radarman called. 



"Those ships are carrying some kind 
of shields!" 

Mackey looked at the screen, saw 
that only two ships remained, and 
that those had grown larger. He 
rubbed his jaw. 

"We're just about in range. Give 
them a blast." 

Deep within the Virtus there was 
the whine of a roton. A long finger 
of light flicked out at the closer dark 
ship and fell short by a thousand 
miles. 

In reply there came a beam from 
the dark ship, also falling short. But 
there was now a change on the screen. 
The ships of Pluto were holding back. 

Mackey rubbed his jaw again. 
"They're steering clear. So it isn't an 
anti-neutron shield, otherwise they 
wouldn't be scared of our beam." 

He had a difficult decision to make. 
With Jupiter so close now his massthrust advantage had grown. At the 
very least he could figure a five minute lapse before the other Plutonian 
ships caught up. And he wanted information . 

"Maneuver Three," he decided. 
"Let's give them a whirl." 

TN THE CLASSIC pattern of Oneagainst-Two the three ships wove 
flaming paths through space, the Two 
trying to box the One and the One 
eluding them by sheer swiftness. Close 
to his receiver the communications 
man huddled, hoping to intercept a 
command that might reveal a coming 
maneuver. 

"Anything?" Mackey demanded. 

"Nothing," the communications officer grunted. He held up a hand and 
said, "Wait! They're calling us!" 

"What do they want?" 

"Surrender or die," the c.o. 'replied 
laconically. 

Everybody laughed, breaking the 
tension that had built up. "Reply?" 
the c,o. asked. 



THE WAY OF A WEEB 



133 



"No," Mackey told him. "They 
might have a lady on board. And I 
couldn't think of a nice way to word 

it." 

Amid more laughter the radarman 
said, "Two man scout ship out!" 

They watched the tiny ship break 
away from its darker mother ship and 
hurl itself toward the Virtus, Too 
small to carry heavy weapons, the 
scout ship was also small enough to 
outspeed the Virtus. And if it got 
close enough it could do sufficient 
damage to cripple the Earth ship. 

Watching the tiny thing come on, 
Mackey also saw a larger pattern 
evolving. He sucked in a jubilant 
breath. 

"Get set for a one degree swing 
left!" he barked, He watched the 
scout ship bore in closer. 

"Nail it!" 

The beam flicked out again, like a 
snake's tongue darting. It touched the 
scout ship briefly. For an instant a 
miniature sun blazed, and then was 
gone, and with it the tiny ship. 

"Now!" Mackey yelled. 

The Virtus heeled over, running 
wide open now with Mackey babbling almost incoherently to himself. 
He was going to catch the two Plutonians in line with each other. He was 
going to execute the beautiful and ancient naval maneuver of crossing the 
Tl 

"Now!" he crooned. 

They witnessed the awesome spectacle of a great ship atomizing, all its 
fissionables going at once. At a distance of millions of miles it would 
appear as a new star being born. Up 
close there was nothing but light. 
Light so incredibly bright that when 
it was gone the blackness of space 
was more intense than ever. 

<( 1VI Y G0D " said Ensign Fuller, 
A shocked for once into humility by what he had seen. 



For the rest there was a momentary 
silence. No shouting, no back slapping, no jubilation. For an instant 
they had looked into the furnace of 
Creation, all except Mackey for the 
first time. They felt hollow inside. 

And then Dimpo was with them 
again, racing ahead of his three 
guardians to throw himself at Crag. 

"Oh my," he wept frantically. "Oh 
my oh my oh my." Teeth chattering 
in -a paroxysm of terror, he flung his 
arms around the stooped prospector 
and clung tight. 

"Sure, sure," Crag said soothingly. 
He patted Dimpo's furry head. 

"What I saw," Dimpo said. He 
had been looking through a porthole. 
"Oh, what I saw!" 

"I know, I know." 

And over Dimpo's wailing the 
radarman said, "Captain! Something 
funny. That lone baby is trying to 
stick to us, not even waiting for its 
friends." 

Mackey looked and it was true. 
The remaining Plutonian ship was riding parallel, instead of running or falling away as it should have. 

"We'll knock them off too," Ensign Fuller exulted, and some of the 
younger officers joined him, their adrenals pumping again in the hope of 
a two-strike. 

Mackey disregarded them, his thin, 
lined face set in the memory of other 
battles, the knowledge lying heavy 
within him that no two battles ever 
had the same pattern. He had gambled 
his ship once in the hope of learning 
something. 

But he had learned nothing. So far 
there was no ace up Pluto's sleeve. 
And that didn't make sense. Nobody 
ever declared war in the certainty of 
losing. 

"Aren't they doing anything?" he 
fretted. 

The radarman twirled his knobs, 
trying for more detail. "Something," 



134 



 



he said. "They just kicked off another one." 
"Scout?" 

"No sir. Smaller. Too small for 
even a one man job." 

Mackey watched the thing grow on 
the screen from a pinpoint to an object the size of an orange. Definitely 
too small for even a one man job, he 
thought. And not moving fast enough, 
although faster than his own ship 
could travel. 

"Give it a burst," he ordered. 

His gunners were good. They hit it 
perfectly, the computers recording the 
object enveloped by the beam. 

They found themselves waiting for 
the flash. Only this time there was no 
flash. The object was now the size 
of a very large orange. 

Mackey cursed. "Something wrong 
with the detonator. Check it!" 

"It checks," he was told. 

They hit it again with the beam, 
and somehow Mackey and all of them 
knew that it was no good even before 
the beam touched it. Nothing was going to happen, and nothing did. 

There was nothing to do but run. 
The thing was only thirty feet or so 
in length, trailing white flame that 
twisted into corkscrew shapes as it 
twisted and turned and dodged, mimicking every move of the Virtus like 
a distant shadow. 

Except that now it was no longer 
so distant. A hundred miles, maybe, 
and even that being cut down slowly 
but surely. 

With the reflexes born of long experience and a mind devoted to a single business. Mackey had headed for 
Jupiter. In open space you were a sitting duck, but any planet might afford protection. And Jupiter was a big 
planet. 

They hopped the peaks and knifed 
down the valleys, too fast for safety 
and flying blind. And behind them 



came the tiny rocket, and now it was 
fifty miles away. 

And somehow they knew that when 
it hit them they were finished. 

They couldn't dodge it and they 
couldn't outrun it. And as they went 
around another peak they knew it was 
the last one, for the thing behind 
them was only a mile away and coming on with the dread certainty of 
doom. . . 

KTOW THEY lay in a deep crevasse, 
the ship resting on its tail. And 
above them through the methane and 
ammonia fog the ships of Pluto flitted, probing, seeking, poking fingers 
of light through the murk. 

"What happened?" someone asked. 

They had seen the flash behind 
them and sensed the explosion that 
must have caused it, even seeming to 
feel the concussion of such a blast, although it was impossible for them to 
have actually felt it. 

"It hit the mountain," Mackey 
said. 

And that was it. It had hit the 
mountain and he had reacted instantly, seizing the chance to drop into 
this great glacial crack in the planet's 
surface. 

Someone wondered aloud: "What in 
blazes was it?" 

Mackey knew, but the knowledge 
was bitter as gall in him, for there 
was not a single thing he could do 
with it. His face was wan and gray 
with the weight of the knowledge. 

"They dragged out the old proximity fuse," he said. "They tuned it 
to the metal of our hull and stuck an 
old fashioned molecular explosive ^ 
warhead on it and used a molecular 
motor for the rocket." 

He cursed savagely, awkwardly, a 
man not given much to cursing. "Not 
a damn fissionable on it, and that's 
why the beam couldn't blow it!" 

"But they've got the same metal oa 



THE WAY OF A WEEB 



135 



their ships as we have," someone else 
protested. 

"Sure, except for the higher density. And that's what the shields are 
for." 

Through the portholes they could 
see shifting fog, and now and then 
a vague light flickering. And sometimes there would be the darker movements that were shadows of the ships 
of Pluto. 

"They'll go away soon," Ensign 
Fuller hoped aloud. "They must think 
that thing got us." 

Mackey might have let him hope 
on, but honesty won out. "If they'd 
got us they'd pick up radiation from 
the crash. And as long as they're not 
getting it they know we're in one 
piece." 

"We could open a damper," Fuller 
suggested brigh'tly. 

"Too concentrated. Crash radiation 
would be scattered." The captain 
shook his head. "You might as well 
have it straight, men. We're alive, 
but that's about all. That mountain 
had enough iron in it to attract the 
rocket, and there's enough iron in the 
walls behind the ice in the crevasse 
we're in to keep them from picking 
us out of the landscape." 

In an agony of frustrated anger 
he banged his fist into his palm. 

"If we had some scouts of our 
own we might try a couple of decoys. 
Maybe one of them might get 
through." That was the c.o., already 
down to wishing for what might have 
been. "They can't have many of those 
proximity deals." 

"No," Mackey agreed. "Or they 
would have used one sooner." 

Again he banged his fist. "But 
enough, I'll bet, to take care of our 
main fleet when it heads up here!" 

The communications officer blinked. 
"I hadn't thought of that. We've got 
to get a warning through I" 

He reached for his microphone and 



Mackey batted his hand away. 

"One peep out of that and we're 
dead!" the captain snapped. "Why do 
you think I ordered all generators off? 
One emanation of any kind and they'll 
nail us." 

He shrugged. "No, here we are and 
here we'll sit." 

"Not for long," Crag said. "Not 
after the batteries run out." They all 
looked at him as though they'd never 
seen him before. 

But' the other prospectors knew 
what he meant. Their heads bobbed 
in silent agreement, their faces showing no fear but a certain resignation. 

"That fog is methane and ammonia," Crag reminded them. "Not 
water vapor. It's a couple of hundred 
degrees below out there." 

TT WAS NOT yet cold inside the 
ship, but that would (gome in time. 
Already the men were getting up to 
walk past the thermocouple for a 
quick look. 

That was the only activity. Except 
for Dimpo the rest was silence. 

.[ >iii!iio vv.-i.iled ujn cash'-rlv. dr-.-: .ji. 
Crag's best efforts to calm him. 

"I'll die," he wept. "I'm going to 
die. We'll all be frozen — " 

"Shut him up!" someone shouted. 

"There, there," Crag soothed. Too 
late for anything but kindness now. 
"We'll be all right, Dimpo." 

"If it weren't for that damn Weeb 
we might've been," the radarman 
said. His eyes lingered on an escape 
hatch. 

"They're going to throw me out!" 
Dimpo screamed. His little hands 
clutched at Crag. 

"Don't worry," Crag told him. 
"This is one tune the doors and windows stay shut." 

It was a gruesome joke, but at 
least he could still joke. Dimpo's 
great eyes regarded him with wonder. 

"You're not afraid, are you?" Dim


136 



 



po asked. "I'm afraid, Crag. I'll die 
here and I'll never gel to see Earth 
and all the brave people." 

"You won't miss much," Crag 
grunted. 

"Both of you shut up!" That was 
Ensign Fuller, the pink freshness gone 
from his cheeks. 

Dimpo lapsed into silence, the tears 
rolling down his face as he huddled 
close to Crag, And the prospector put 
his arm around the Weeb and held 
him gently, as he might have held a 

"Don't worry," Crag whispered. 
"Captain Mackey'll get us out of this. 
That's how he got all those medals on 
his chest, getting out of tough spots." 

Dimpo looked at the medals and 
was distracted for a moment. So many 
colors and so much glitter denoted an 
unbelievable amount of courage. 

And yet-^jCaptain Mackey seemed 
perturbed. He was pacing up and 
back, peering through the portholes, 
rubbing his hands over his face. Once 
he stopped and looked out a long 
time. 

When he turned back he seemed 
to have reached a decision. 

"Gentlemen," he said, "I think 
we'd better take off." 

"But they're still there!" someone 
protested. 

"More than ever," Mackey agreed. 
He pointed at a porthole and said, 
"Have a look." 

Peering out, they could see the 
faint shadows now and then. It seemed 
that several of them moved very slowly. 

"Looks like they're landing scouts," 
Mackey said. "They can't spot us 
from above, so the obvious answer is 
to send out surface crews." 

TN REALITY he was offering them 
a choice, a choice of dying one 
way or another. If they tried to take 
off they would certainly be blasted, 



either by an enemy beam or by another proximity rocket. 

And if they sat tight they were 
almost as certain to be discovered fay 
a searching party. 

It was a knowledge that sucked 
their bellies in tight. Maybe at that 
very moment there were dim figures 
on the edges of the crevasse; And in 
another moment there might be an 
eruption of flame and a terrible roar, 
and the end of them all. 

"A decision like this should be put 
to a vote," Mackey said. "As for 
myself, I'd rather go out with all guns 
firing. Think about it for a minute." 

They thought about it, all of them 
except Dimpo. The Weeb was too terrified to think. 

"They might miss us," the radarman said. "Maybe ff we just sit it 
out. . . " 

"If we only had some way of knowing how close they were," the c.o. 
fretted. "But to sit here like this — " 

Mackey nodded. "There's a way, 
all right. If one or more of us were 
to get up out of the crevasse. Then, if 
we remain undetected, we sit tight. 
If we're on the verge of being found, 
well, we'd have enough warning so we 
could get aloft. 

"Under the circumstances, however," Mackey continued, "I can't 
very well order anyone to do it." 

And they knew well enough why 
he wouldn't give such an order, To 
their enemy the intense cold was a 
daily hazard, and so was the greater 
gravity. But for an Earthman to climb 
a wall of ice, weighing what he would 
weigh on Jupiter, and knowing that 
a pinhole in his space suit would be 
sure death . . . 

Dimpo, as well as they, understood 
the situation. Yet he was certain that 
volunteers would come forward. Humans were brave, humans were fearless. Especially military men, with 
medals. 



THE WAY OF A WEEB 



137 



But the silence grew long and uncomfortable. And in the end it was 
Crag who broke it. 

"Hell," he grunted. "I'll do it. I'm 
used to operating in a space suit, 
, crawling around god-forsaken terrain 
like tiiis. And at least I know how to 
handle an ice-ax and a rope, which 
you military fellows probably don't." 

Suddenly it seemed to Dimpo that 
his heart had stopped beating. He felt 
no sensations at all, only a queer 
numbness. Crag was gone from Ms 
side, was getting into his space suit 
with the axe and the coil of rope 
at his feet. 

In another minute Crag would be 
gone. And he, Dimpo, would be left 
alone in this ship with all these men 
staring at him and hating him. As 
though he were a — a Weeb. 

All alone, he would be, with the 
only human who might protect him 
far on the outside. 

"I want to go too," Dimpo said. 

Strange, he hadn't wanted to say 
it. He hadn't willed his tongue to 
move. But there the words were; he 
could hear them and it was his own 
voice all right. 

"I want to go. Take me along, Crag. 
Take me with you," he was crying. 

He had his arms around Crag's 
middle, preventing the man from getting the space suit zippered up all 
the way. Very gently Crag tried to 
pry Dimpo loose. 

"You better stay here," Crag said. 
"You'll be safer." 

"Get away from him, you damn 
We?b!" Clutching hands seized him, 
but hs only held on tighter. 

"Let me go with you," Dimpo 
begged. "I'll help, honest I will!" He 
knew he couldn't stay here, not with 
the eyes staring at him full of hate 
and blaming him for everything. 

"I'll help. I will! I'll make myself 
light and help you and I won't get in 
your way or anything. Crag! Crag!" 



/"•RAG STOPPED trying to un^ clench his fingers, stopped pushing him away. The prospector's eyebrows were lifted as the gist of what 
Dimpo was saying struck him. He 
waved away the men who were trying 
so roughly to pull the Weeb from him. 

"Wait a minute," Crag said. "Wait 
a minute." 

It was going to be a climb up that 
wall of ice. It was going to be the 
worst climb he'd ever had, and it 
might just be the beginning. His 
weight would be enormous, but his 
strength would not increase with it. 

On the other hand, Dimpo, in proportion to his own weight, would 
have the strength of a giant! 

"Dimpo," he said, taking the tiny 
face between his rough hands. "Listen, Dimpo, do you really want to 
go?" ": '>-'■ 

"Really, really," Dimpo assured 
him, the oily blue tears flowing. 

"You won't get in my way? You'll 
watch my signals and do everything 
I tell you to do?" 

"I promise," Dimpo said. He had' 
heard prospectors strike bargains and 
he knew just how to word this. His 
great, moist eyes looked into Crag's 
and he said, "I give you my solemn 
oath as a— a Weeb." 

"O.K. Go get your suit." 

With a glad little squeak Dimpo 
ran for his small pile of gear. On the 
long haul from the Asteroids Crag had 
cut down an old suit of his own so that 
it fit Dimpo, and of all Dimpo's possessions that was prized most highly. 

It fit around his thin body loosely, 
complete as any human's space suit. 
The chemical heat packs, the insulation, even the small two-way communications set; everything was there. 
The helmet was too big; that couldn't 
be cut down; but he'd never minded 
that.

Then Crag's hand made the signal 
for "Let's go," and they were moving 
along together. 

Crag took a last look behind him 
at his friends and they jerked their 
thumbs upward. Hand in hand he and 
Dimpo went through the first lock. 
There was a quick hiss of escaping air 
and the lock was slammed behind 
them. 

Another lock and then one more 
and then the last one. 

They were outside the ship, standing off a tail fin in the shifting fog. 
The ship towered alongside them, 
and on the other side was the faintly 
gleaming ice. 

Crag shuffled his feet, saving himself the effort of lifting them. Behind 
him now, Dimpo did the same. The 
Weeb felt the pull of the planet, 
somehow greater than it had been inside the ship, and he took a deep 
breath and rid himself of the extra 
weight. * 

There was a set pattern to this 
kind of climbing and they fell into 
it. Crag inched upward and Dimpo 
stayed on his heels. 

For Dimpo it was easier. He needed 
only a tiny handhold. 

Time and again Crag's foot slipped, 
and each time Dimpo got a hand up 
to steady it. There was a glow of 
pride inside him. He was helping! He 
was really helping! 

The fog was an eerie thing to Dimpo. Accustomed to the crystal clearness of Deimos days and nights and 
the airless clarity of the Asteroids, 
he felt as a man might feel swimming 
in murky waters. The fog swirled and 
shifted gently, and sometimes he could 
see a short distance, sometimes only 
Crag's bulky form above him. 

He saw Crag's hand move now, in 
a desperate signal. Stuck, the signal 



said, and it was a feeble signal. Crag 
was tired. 

But he couldn't be! They couldn't ■ 
back down! They had to keep moving 
upward. To try to back down was 
sure death. 

Dimpo's hand tapped against Crag's 
foot: Keep going. And Crag's signal 
came back: Can't. 

There was only one thing for Dimpo to do. Breathing deeply, he made 
himself lighter yet. A gentle push and 
he moved upward alongside Crag. 
He got his arm under Crag's and 
lifted. 

It would either work, or it wouldn't. 
Either he'd be able to transfer some 
of his own weightlessness to Crag, or 
the. resulting tug was going to pull 
them both loose. 

Dimpo lifted. There was no tug. 
Crag moved upward again. 

TTHEY LAV on the icy surface, Crag 
letting some of his strength flow 
back into his muscles, Dimpo exhausted by the effort of will he had made. 
Overhead, shadows flitted. 

They had to move, they had to get 
going. Crag got up slowly, uncoiling 
the long rope. He fastened it clumsily 
but surely to a projection. 

For an instant Dimpo hoped they 
were going down. He didn't want to 
stay up here in this fog, not with those 
dark shapes above, not with the possibility that at any moment other 
dark shapes might appear closer. 

But Crag wasn't going down. Motioning Dimpo to stay close to him, 
he started away from the edge of the 
chasm, his feet barely lifting from 
the surface so as to conserve strength. 

They shuffled along, moving in a 
wide arc. They edged aroung a hump, 
they inched their way through weirdly 
shaped columns of ice that gleamed 
faintly green in the fog. 

There was a solid lump of ice in 



THE WAY OF A WEEB 



139 



Dimpo's stomach now. The crevasse 
was somewhere behind them now, but 
he didn't know where. If anything 
happened to Crag he'd never be able 
to find it again. 

But suddenly Crag was no longer 
there! Dimpo's body shook with panic. 
Like the stupid Weeb he was he'd let 
his mind wander, he'd lost Crag! 

He was all alone! 

And then, just in time to save his 
sanity, the fog shifted. Near a great 
chunk of ice he saw Crag's figure 
again. He ran, his little heart beating 
wildly, his lips moving in a vow never 
to let Crag out of his sight again. 

He stopped running. His heart 
stopped beating. Terror froze him in 
his tracks, then let him move only 
enough to fade into the shadow of an 
icy pillar. 

The fog had shifted again, and off 
to his right lay the bulk of a scout 
ship! 

And moving away from it and toward Crag were two smaller dark 
shapes ! 

Like wraiths, the men of Pluto. 
Tall, immensely tall, and thin as 
boards, even hi their space suits. They 
were used to such terrain; they moved 
surely ; they moved right for the 
place where Crag was! 

Without thinking, Dimpo switched 
on his two-way. 

"Crag I" he screamed. And then 
just a long scream of terror. 

TOO LATE he realized what he had 
done. The two shapes were 
stopped. Now they were moving again, 
but now they were moving purposefully. 

He'd given himself away. He'd given Crag away, he'd given all of them 
away! 

They hadn't known there was anyone around. They'd just been moving along, and they might just as well 
have passed within fifty feet of Crag 



or himself and never known. 

But now they knew. Coming from 
off to the right, they couldn't see 
Crag yet. But in another minute or so 
they would. 

The prospector was trying to work 
his way into the deeper shadows of 
some nearby icy humps. But he was 
moving at the speed of a snail. He'd 
never make it! They were getting too 
close! 

They'd get Crag! They'd kill him! 
And then he'd be alone, and he didn't 
know how to get back to the ship! 

Maybe there wouldn't even be a 
ship. Now they knew that it was close 
by. As soon as they'd killed Crag 
they'd have all those dark ships down 
here. 

What had he done? 

The only human who'd ever had a 
kind word for him, the only human 
who would protect hirn, and he'd cost 
Crag his life! 

THEY WERE moving faster now, 
those two tall shapes, faster than 
Crag could move. Another minute, a 
matter of seconds, and those terrible 
guns would eat the space suit off 
Crag, eat the skin and the flesh from 
him! 

Dimpo couldn't breathe, But he 
caught a deep breath, sucked it into 
his little lungs. 

He could- hear Crag stumbling, he 
could hear the two tall ones, their 
footsteps rapid now. 

But they couldn't hear Dimpo. Almost floating, with only enough 
weight to give him traction, he made 
no sound at all. To Dimpo the Weeb, 
his t knife with its half-inch blade hi 
his hand, this was old stuff. 

There they were now, right before 
him, their awful guns rigid in their 
hands. Their eyes were forward, intent on what was before them. 

Tiny Jupe cats hadn't heard Dimpo. 
Neither did these towering men of 



140 



 



Pluto. 

There they were, one ahead slightly and one a few feet back to the 
left. 

Nowl 

A SMALL cut, only a few inches 
in length. That was all. No need 
to pause. Faster than a shot the intense coid had done the work. It was 
inside the suit. The towering figure 
was still, frozen forever, a statue of 
ice. 

Once more. Slash. Another statue. 

It was easy, so easy. And there 
was Crag, still desperately stumbling. 

Dimpo floated around him, waving. 
For a moment he thought Crag was 
going to fall. He jumped forward and 
caught the prospector's arms and 
helped him regain his balance. 

Quickly he tapped the message: Are 
you all right? 

Crag nodded. That was good. He'd 
been terribly afraid. What if Crag 
were not all right? Then what would 
he have done? 

But Crag was looking back, pointing at the frozen figures behind them 
and then pointing at Dimpo. You? 
came the taps. 

Dimpo bobbed his helmet, waved 
the tiny knife to show how he had 
done it. He was happy, very happy, 
for the pressure of Crag's hand on his 
arm told him he had done well. 

Now what? Dimpo's taps went, and 
Crag's reply was: Back. And that was 
good, too, because more than anything 
Dimpo wanted to get back to the 
ship, to get out of this awful fog. ■ 

And Crag was wonderful. With the 
infallible sense of direction that had 
taken him across the barrens of Mars 
and the shifting sands of Deimos and 
a hundred other trackless places, he 
was picking his way back. 

Somehow Crag knew. Somehow 
there were signs that had registered 
in his brain, without him even thinking about them. 



Here were the icy mounds he had 
stumbled across in his flight, here 
were pillars of ice, here a jagged, upended cube gleaming faintly. 

Overhead a ship moved now and 
then, making a shadow. But not more 
ships than there had been before. 
They had received no message. 

And there at last the dark hull of 
the scout ship. It would be some 
time before it was missed. There 
would not be two patrols close- together. 

Not much further now, Dimpo 
thought happily. Just a little way and 
they would be at the crevasse. And 
.then a slide down the long rope and 
they would be inside the ship again. 

But Crag was stopping. He was 
looking back, at the scout ship. 

Dimpo's heart contracted in the 
clutch of fear. More scouts? It was a 
two-man, but maybe there'd been a 
third one squeezed in. He was afraid 
to turn and look. 

But Crag was turning him about. 
What was he doing? He was walking 
toward the small ship ! He was waving 
Dimpo to come along! 

Then the ship was directly before 
them and Crag was looking it over. 
Why, Dimpo couldn't see. It was just 
like the big ones, except in" size. The 
same . materials, even, except that it 
didn't have one of those shields 
around it. 

Now Crag was tapping the ship, 
making strange motions with his 
hande. What did he want? Try to lift 
the ship? 

It was impossible. With the first 
thrust of his thin shoulders Dimpo 
knew he could never budge this thing. 
A hundred Weebs might have lifted 
it, but not one. 

But that wasn't what Crag had 
wanted. He was going to tap it out. 
First he was pointing up along the 
side of the ship to an escape hatch, 
now he was pointing to himself, and 



THE WAY OF A WEEB 



141 



now tapping: Lift me. 

So that was it! The hatch was too 
high for him to reach, but maybe with 
Dimpo giving him a boost he could 
make it. 

Dimpo bent low, grabbed Crag's 
ankles. With all the strength he could 
muster he pushed upward, Crag helping as much as he could by pulling 
with his hands. 

Somehow he made it. He had the 
hatch open and was signalling Dimpo 
to come up. That was the easy part 
of it. A leap and he was up there, and 
Crag had a hand outstretched to help 
him in. 

And finally they were inside the 
main compartment and it was just 
like the other rockets Dimpo had 
seen. Crag had his suit off and was 
checking over the controls. 

And now Dimpo knew what Crag 
was going to do. He was going to 
take off in this ship! Before anyone 
knew what was happening he would 
have 'them both out of here! They'd 
be safe I 

He felt the ship lift. But why so 
slowly? It was only up a few hundred 
feet and Crag was stopping it. It 
was tilting, moving slowly to one 
side. It was dropping! 

It was dropping into that awjul 
crevasse, right alongside the Virtus! 

Dimpo began to weep. 

UOURE," THE captain said. "It 
^ wouldn't be too difficult. No 
tougher than shooting a flea off a 
dog's ear at a hundred yards, with a 
bow and a crooked arrow. Standing 
on your head, that is." 

Crag shrugged. "All right. It was 
just an idea. You don't like it, Dimpo 
and I can slide that scout back out 
of the ship-release port and try to 
make it on our own." 
Mackey laughed. 

"No, no, don't get me wrong. I like 
it. I'd like anything better than sit


ting here, wondering if this is my 
last breath." 

He looked at his men. "Well?" 

"It's a lousy break on mass," the 
radarman said. "We total more than 
fifty times the scout. We'll have to 
come darn close." 

"If we don't get hit before we even 
have a chance to try it," someone 
else grumbled. 

"If the dog hadn't stopped — " 
Mackey began disgustedly. "Look 
here, the man and the Weeb are 
waiting. They could have taken off 
without asking us; maybe they still 
have time. They're entitled to a fast 
answer. All right now." 

He raked his eyes around. 
"Hands!" he said. "All in favor..." 

The hands went up. There was no 
need to count. They were all tired 
of sitting and waiting for it to 9it 
them. 

"Good," Mackey said. 

He clapped his hands. "All right, 
engineers! Get those controls wired. 
And make sure those scout motors 
are absolutely balanced. When I push 
the button I'd better not throw a, 
curve." 

He was moving now, the gray gone 
from his face. Any plan was better 
than none, and if he died at least 
he'd die out in space, not in this miserable glacial crack. 

They all felt better now. The engineers vanished down the hatch to 
the ship-release port and came back 
trailing their wires. The radarman 
hummed as he leaned over his switches. Even Ensign Fuller sang snatches 
of a song about rocketeers not having 
ears but only holes in their heads. 

And suddenly Captain Mackey was 
shouting, "Belts, everyone! We hit 
it on all six!" 

His hand went up. "Five-fourthree-two-Hit ! " 

There was no sound, but Dimpo 
could feel the roar in his stomach. 



142 



 



He tried to cut his weight but it was 
no use. He couldn't catch his breath; 
it was all squeezed out of him. He 
couldn't even scream. 

Outside the portholes there was a 
gray wall a thousand miles high and 
it unrolled like a ribbon until suddenly it was gone and there was nothing but black outside. And the radar 
screen was spangled with ships. 

"Fire at will!" Mackey commanded, 
and threw the ship into a crazy spiral 
that gave the gunners no hope of hitting anything. 

The c.o. was pouring stuff into the 
transmitter, praying that enough of it 
got through even if he himself didn't. 

Too fast for them to keep track.. The 
defense computer was calling the enemy blasts: "Miss left port, miss right 
^il, miss right bow, miss. . ." 

They were all misses, some of them 
hundreds of miles off, some of them 
too close for comfort. 

"Dropped one behind!" the radarman yelled. A moment later he shouted, "Lost another!" The ships of 
Pluto were fewer on his screen, and 
each one left behind was a millstone 
from their necks. 

And then at last the only thing that 
counted, the thing they'd been waiting to hear. 

"Here it comes!" 

TT CAME from off their port side, 
from a thousand miles across the 
void, and it was a tiny thing, comparatively, a relic of bygone days. 

It was a missile off the military 
junk heap. It was a slingshot against 
Goliath. And it could do to the Virtus what the slingshot had done to Gohath. 

They watched it come on, watched 
it creep closer, watched its inexorable 
march across the screen. 

"Good thing they didn't use two," 
Mackey said, and picked up the wires 
and the makeshift switch. 



"She's off our bow," he said, checking the screen. "Put her on our tail." 

And they wasted a precious minute 
cutting back so that the thing now 
flew directly behind them. "How 
far?" the captain asked. 

"Hundred miles," the radarman 
said. 

"We'll wait. Keep her steady." 

They waited. They kept her steady. 
They watched their doom move up 
to seventy-five, to fifty miles, to forty 
miles. 

"Pray," said Mackey. 

He pushed a button and a red light 
went on. The release was open. He 
closed the switch. 

It was like being kicked in the 
back by a mule. A flash of fire and 
the scout ship was away, flying blind. 

It had to be close, it had to be 
awfuily close. It had to miss by less 
than a mile, otherwise the relative 
mass of the Virtus would remain 
greater. 

But it was less than a mile! It was 
far less! 

Like an angry hornet the proximity 
rocket spun, its dreadful affinity now 
centered on the closer ship. 

They watched the chase, they saw 
the flash. And then the sky was black 
and there was nothing but space between the Virtus and Earth. 

/"TRAG LOLLED in his seat, a cigar 
clamped between his teeth, and 
watched the blue ball that was Earth 
grow larger through the porthole. Beside him Dimpo sat and trembled. 

"Take it easy," Crag said. 

"Maybe they won't like me," Dimpo moaned. 

"With that medal on your chest? 
Why, you're a hero!" 

Dimpo fingered the medal Captain 
Mackey had pinned on him. It should 
have made him feel brave, but it 
didn't. All he could think about was 



THE WAY OF A WEEB 



143 



the people, the way they'd stare at 
him. 

I wish I was back on Deimos," he 
said. His lips began to quiver and 
the mositure welled up in his eyes. 

"I'm afraid, Crag," he wailed. 

Ensign Fuller, passing up the aisle, 
saw him and paused. "What's with you 
now?" he demanded. 

"I'm afraid," Dimpo wept. 

"Afraid? Of what?" 

Crag shifted the cigar and glared 



up at him. "Just afraid," he said. "A 
Weeb is always afraid. So what?" 

"Nothing," Fuller said. "So nothing." 

He patted Dimpo on the shoulder. 
"Don't worry about a thing. You'll 
be all right, Dimpo." 

"Mr, Dimpo," Crag said. 

"Mr. Dimpo," said Ensign Fuller, 
He was quite serious. 

THE END
