'' '' tell me , '' the tourist insisted. the story of gordak and the snow-maid had become , in. t/n years , half legendary. twisted , distorted , it was a veritable saga of the space ways , a chimera tale for the eager tourists. the spaceman lost himself for a time in the amber depths of his drink. '' to understand , '' he mused , `` you 'd have to know what gordak was like. l7 118 and you 'd have to know the albino girl , snow. then there was b'jak of the spider people. you 'd have to know 'em all. '' '' tell me , '' the tourist said again , eagerly. the spaceman drank deeply of the heady ptah. `` we 've come a long way in ten years. '' he said. `` a decade ago , any extra-terrestrial being not quite human was fair prey for the interplanetary circuses. the most fabulous of all was gordak 's , yet gordak himself was n't quite human. . . `` gordak elbowed his way to the imported mahogany bar of kelly 's marsport. spacemen and tourists alike moved over readily enough to give him all the room he wanted. there was something of the macabre about the gnarled little half-breed , something distasteful and horrid ' which told people to avoid him. carstairs , however , didn't. he pushed his way through to gordak 's side and asked , `` you 're gordak , are n't you ? '' the gnarled little man nodded. '' you are punctual , i see , mr. carstairs. can you take a spaceship up as promptly ? '' '' i sure can , '' carstairs told him. despite the fact that he was unemployed , he was proud of his spaceman 's training. carstairs could astrogate , and he knew it. his unemployment , of course , did not indicate a lack of ability. 2139 was a lean year in which the outer-world colonists had settled down seriously to the task of civilizing the virgin worlds. as a consequence , luna 's astrogation school had gradtiated a considerable surplus of first-rate astrogators. carstairs had been caught in the shuffle. now he needed a job , badly. the rat-race of the legitimate freighter service had red-taped his credentials on the wrong end of a long waiting list. thus it was that he turned to gordak. he showed him the photostat of his credentials. the half-breed gave them a cursory examination and , satisfied , he nodded. `` you 'll do , carstairs — with"

'' '' what 's that ? '' '' you are to astrogate for me , that is all. outside of that , you are to mind your own business. '' his voice was an odd mixture of the deep-throated martian and the accents of an earth bred human. `` i 'll pay you well : fifty solar credits a week. '' if carstairs sensed the hidden menace in his employer 's tones , he ignored it. he said that the set-up suited him fine , and when gordak returned his credentials , he followed the little half-breed out of the marsport ear and hurriedly through the chill night air of marsport avenue to the spaceport. hthe spaceship was one of those old freight-tubs which had been converted for circus use , with , thirty years of extra-asteroidal service behind it. carstairs realized with a smile that this was no star queen he was getting , and when he mentally compared the smooth lines of that great luxury craft with the stubby silhouette of gordak 's p. t , barnum , he chuckled softly to himself. well , these days a job was a job , and carstairs felt thankful enough. his first surprise came when gordak told him to biast off at once. '' but i 'll have to compute an approximate orbit to our destination , '' the astrogator argued. '' that will not be necessary , '' gordak assured him , `` since we are not yet ready to leave mars. you will rocket the barnmn to the south-polar co-ordinates i have designated on the chart , at once , mr. carstairs. '' carstairs shrugged and sat down ©ordak 's car & o 119 in the pilot 's seat. he coutd not imagine what gordak could possibly want on the barren tundras of the south-polar region. equatorial mars was n't much warmer than earth 's temperate zones in mid-winter , but life was at least possible. people referred to south polar mars as the ice box , and they were n't kidding , even if the term were a bit antiquated. utterly lifeless , except for the fanciful rumors of the snow people who existed deep within the mountain grottos. surely gordak was n't the type to be taken in by mere rumor. . . when gordak had not returned for three days , carstairs became restless. he had eaten and slept in a monotonous routine and he had read a few books from gordak 's library , but the endless white blanket of snow outside and the hot-house atmosphere of the p. t. barnum had combined to make him restless. snow man or whatever gordak sought out there on the ghostly white tundra , he wished the little circus-master would find it. on the morning of the fourth day his boredom got the better of him. it may be that he forgot gordak 's warning to mind his own business , or it may be"

'' i am b'jak , '' the words came from the spider-mouth in clacking monosyllables. '' you — speak ! `` gasped carstairs , amazed. '' and why not ? '' the creature called b'jak responded. `` as a matter of fact , my friend , i am something of a linguist. my webs and my knowledge of language — these keep me occupied when otherwise gordak 's strange trade would drive me insane. of course i speak : i have mastered fourteen languages , mostly outer-world dialects , with which i amuse myself. '' b'jak dropped soundlessly from his web to the floor. he clicked again : `` since you are fully human , you are obviously not a new addition to gordak 's cargo. i assume you are the new astrogator. '' carstairs told him he was. but his thoughts whirled hopelessly distant from his role here on the p. t. barnum. this spider man had intelligence equal to a human's. yet he was caged to perform at gordak 's shows ; chained to the will of gordak ; his life a feeble flame which gordak could snuff out with no consequences whatever. tthe spider-head nodded on the suggestion of a neck. `` i know what you think , astrogator. someday , perhaps , this will not be. in the meanwhile , gordak accentuates the gravity of the situation by — `` carstairs had not heard the outer lock open , so engrossed had he been with the spider man. nor did he hear gordak , relieved of his space-suit , come stomping down the corridor. the door opened suddenly. '' mr. carstairs , '' the half-breed 's no tones were ice , `` i thought i told you to keep to your instruments. if you will be kind enough to leave ? '' wordless , carstairs withdrew. but something told him io remain within sight of the open doorway , and he did. he saw gordak remove a coiled lash from his thick belt , saw b'jak cower in a corner opposite his web of tapestry."

'' the computation of an orbit is not hard work. much of it is mechanical , since the orbit is only a temporary one anyway , allowing plenty of room for what the spacemen call `` ether drift '' or for any chance encounter with cosmic debris. as one half of carstair 's brain computed , the other half actively considered the strangeness of his employer. could the apparent motiveless malignity of gordak be explained by the appearance of the man ? his body was gnarled and twisted , forged in heli-fires by a cross-eyed demon. and his face was a catastrophe. thick and leathery martian skin hung in great folds from the gaunt cheek-bones , draped loosely over the sunken cheeks , puffed as if filled with air under the deep-set eyes. the nose was twisted and broken , it seemed , in a score of places , and the mouth stretched out in a perpetual leer made all the more hideous when gordak attempted to smile. now , thought the astrogator , if gordak sensed that bis features instilled nothing but revulsion for him in men , did he attempt to save his warped self-respect by asserting his own superiority over the other world denizens in his circus troupe ? did gordak vent a thoroughly agitated spleen on b'jak the loan spider man and the score of other performers under his control ? carstairs found this to be a distinct possibility , and his attempted indifference to gordak 's"

'' now , the astrogator knew this was n't part of his job , but on the other hand , the entire crew of the p. t. sarnum consisted of himself and gordak. if gordak wanted him he had no choice but to obey. putting out the cigarette , he descended the ramp and searched for gordak. ' '' the circus net is an ingenious affair. as he neared his employer , carstairs realized that. whatever gordak sought upon the tundras of the south polar region , it was apparent he had found it , apparent that it twisted and writhed futilely now in the net. on the outside it is like any other net of strong wire mesh , but on the inside it is sticky like the web of a spider. the more a captive animal struggles , the more entangled it becomes. '' as i open the net , '' said gordak , panting , `` you grab the creature if it attempts to flee. '' carstairs nodded. gordak 's hands manipulated the zipper front of the net , and presently carstairs could see within the opaque mesh. at first there was nothing but a gleaming whiteness , but as gordak spread the opening apart to relieve the adhesion , he saw an arm , a delicately molded arm of glistening white , of a pale sparkling white that only the martian snows , untouched and utterly virgin in the thin , dustless air , could match. '' i will call her snow , '' gordak declared as the gir ! sat up , as one might matter-of-factly dub a pet mongrel. the girl stood free of her prison slowly , like one unaccustomed to the newness of a situation , and in no hurry to find out about it. carstairs gasped. if he had ever seen so beautiful a girl before it was in one of those fanciful dreams which comes once in a lifetime and which you know is a d : eam because of the impossible beauty of your vision. he had to admit , grudgingly , that '' snow '' was a good name. the whiteness of the girl was of new alabaster , of the flawless white that a pearl tries to capture but can not . even the hair"

'' he smiled at her reassuringly , and she smiled back , then said in a voice of molten silver , `` quey esi kor ? '' '' honey , '' carstairs responded , `` i do n't understand a word of it , but do n't you worry. do n't you worry about a thing. '' '' oh , come now , '' chided gordak , fumbling with snow 's arm and leading her back towards where b'jak 's and the other cubicles lay. `` she 's an outerworld creature , mr. carstairs. she may look human to you , but that shall merely be her appeal to our audience. she 's hardly human , you know. '' carstairs snorted angrily. `` she is human ! '' he insisted. for a long while gordak stared at the incredible whiteness of his prisoner. `` perhaps , '' he mumbled thickly , `` perhaps she is almost — woman. yes— '' and frowning , carstairs saw something which must have been dead a long time come alive in gordak 's eyes. as the days passed , carstairs saw almost nothing of snow. somewhere 'low decks she lived in her little cu 122 bicle along with b '' jak and the other members of gordak 's troupe. as for gordak , the man seemed oddly distracted , like a sleep-walker who awoke long enough to snap a cursory order or two at his employee , but who walked about for the most part completely withdrawn. once he did see the two of them together , when gordak took the girl 'bove-decks for a costume to match her strange beauty. the half-breed seemed immensely pleased with himself , hut carstairs was aware of a new look in the innocent expression of snow , a look which both questioned and pleaded and which , he realized angrily , had something of fear in it. he tried to catch her eye , and when he fancied he did he essayed a brief -smile but if snow saw it she gave it no heed. carstairs found himself grumbling half aloud , and for want of something better to do , he took the ship off automatic and piloted it himself for a while. ry\e morning when they had perhaps bisected the distance between mars and earth , gordak seemed oddly unnerved. with carstairs he had always been taciturn , although for him that implied"

'' carstairs shrugged helplessly and did as he was bid , accutely conscious of the fear again on snow 's face. he drew his eyes away from the girl and watched. now gordak 's rubbery callistian gyrated about the lounge , manipulating his body in incredible contortions. carstairs knew his limbs and torso were jointed like the body of a serpent rather than a man 's , yet still he watched , fascinated. a stumble , a mis-step , the slightest indication of what to gordak was an unwarranted clumsiness , and the little half-breed would snap his whip , shooting the thin lash out across the bare shoulders of the callistian. that it hurt was evident by the fact that the creatures winced and stumbled all the more , but it seemed accustomed to such treatment. gordak felt no fear at this point , for he forgot carstairs completely and went about his business , his face twisted in the leer which passed for a smile and which carstairs felt certain had nothing of mirth in it. a half dozen other creatures performed under the tutelage of gordak 's whip. then a giant of a man stepped forth , human in form , but eight feet tall and proportioned like a hercules , with slate-gray skin and a single big green eye surveying gordak severely from the center of the great forehead. carstairs had heard of this creature , had heard of the fabulous strength of polyphemus , gordak 's tritonian cyclops. he watched now as the towering being performed his feats of strength , bent his metal bars , lifted his huge metal weights. for all the strength indicated , there was something gentle about polyphemus , and carstairs saw his utter indifference to gordak 's whip as the circus-master employed it for what he considered a shoddy performance but for what , in truth , left carstairs amazed. he turned away , slightly sick. almost human these creatures were — surely with as many human traits as gordak himself possessed , yet he treated them like dumb brutes. well , carstairs could understand their hatred , but he had to admire the stoical indifference displayed by the performers. he admired it , but he pitied it as well. then it was snow 's turn. an angry buzzing came from the score of alien throats. their indifference was replaced by hostility. carstairs could sense that , and so could gordak.

'' burton said. inside of him he was suddenly aware of a feverish wish that this girl might have been his daughter. he would have liked to have had a daughter like this , who was in utter and complete control of herself and of the moment , and of the participants in that moment. sure , she had been terrified when carwold had been killed. who would n't be terrified at the sight of real death coming up so suddenly and so unexpectedly. but this girl had been able to control her terror. she had kept from screaming , from running , from finding relief in hysterics. in so doing , she had come up so tremendously in the eyes of richard burton that he was finding himself wishing she was his daughter. in this moment , she was stronger than red malumby , than jake frederickson , and maybe stronger than richard burton. but she was more of a mystery than ever. if she was in such perfect control of herself , what was she doing here in this desert ? what tremendous force had brought her here to face death unflinchingly. she must be in love , burton thought. but in love with whom ? she looked at him , one single long searching glance , then went striding on past him. he had the dazed impression that she had evaluated him too , as she had evaluated such diverse factors as red malumby and sam carwold and sudden death and water spilled forever in the sand — and was moving resolutely on in pursuit of some goal that only she knew. prederickson and malumby were coming along too. frederickson was weeping now. he was protesting over and over his loyalty to red malumby , yelling that no matter what happened , red could be sure that one man would never double-cross him — and that this man was jake frederickson. malumby was n't buying much of it. he was n't even listening to frederickson. he was watching the girl , he was following her. but jake was apparently distracting him. finally he said , '' shut your big mouth , jake.

'' '' so he could , '' burton said. '' damn you , do n't you go to getting ideas ! '' malumby shot out. then he apologized , a little. `` aw , pop , you 're too old for that , i guess. '' '' yeah , i guess so , '' burton said. neither of them mentioned the subject again. nor did either of them mention the dead man or the empty canteen back there on the desert sands. instead malumby went to another subject. '' pop , you 're sure we 'll make zanadu today ? '' t^-nadtj was not a martian name , ^ it was a name given by humans to a place on mars. it came , of course , from the lines : `` in xanadu did kublai khan , a stately pleasure dome decree , where alph , the sacred river ran , through caverns measureless to man , down to a sunless sea. '' no one remembered the name of the man who had given the name of zanadu to the place where they were going , but that man had certainly known his coleridge. when he had called this place zanadu , he had not had in mind any `` stately pleasure dome '' aspects of the area. there were no pleasure dome aspects in this zanadu , or not as human understood pleasure. the man who had named this place zanadu had had in mind '' the caverns measureless to man , '' aspect of the place. zanadu was exactly that— measureless to man. so measureless that only one man had ever gone there and had gotten away safely. richard burton , now on his way back to zanadu. scientific expeditions had asked permission to go there and had been refused , for reasons known only to the martian mind , thieves had gone there , intending to loot the place. one of the thieves had been found wandering in the desert , near death from hunger and from thirst. the skeletons of other intended thieves had been found. thieves going to zanadu always left very fast. no thief was ever actually able to explain why he had left so fast , but unquestionably two things were true : there was loot to be taken in zanadu , and there was also something in zanadu which sent marauders hurrying away. there was loot in plenty in this secluded martian city. the place was unguarded as human understood the word. or so it looked from the outside. burton cast a glance at the small orb in the sky , the sun as seen from mars. `` we had better reach it today , '' he said. `` or tonight. tomorrow , some of us will be crawling. '' '' i figured that , '' malumby said."

'' '' i see , '' burton said. the point was slightly obscure but valid just the same , or valid enough to have resulted in the death of sam carwold. '' well , i believe we 'll be in bad enough shape when we get there to fool even duma shor. '' he felt a slight twinge of fear at the thought of fooling duma shor. that martian was old and wise beyond the understanding of an earthman. fooling duma shor was like trying to fool a god ; you took a mighty big chance in trying it. `` we ought to make it all right. '' '' okay , i 'm running on your orders , '' malumby said. `` they took you in when you were more dead than alive and you are the only human being they have ever taken in. if being more dead than alive when you get to zanadu is what gets you in , then by god , that 's exactly the way we are going to be when we get there. we terror out of zanadu 69 got to stay there long enough to get the job done. '' «w7e can do it , '' burton said. his dry voice expressed his profound belief on this point. spots were already beginning to appear before his eyes , like dancing ghosts at the edge of the world , and his legs were so heavy that he could hardly force them forward. '' one thing i do n't get ? '' malumby said. '' what ? '' '' i do n't get your place in this picture , '' malumby said. `` me , i 'm easy to figure. i 'm a thief and i know it. jake , he 's a thief and he knows , but a weak one and he knows that too , so he will never double-cross me. nancy , i ca n't figure at all. and i ca n't figure you. '' '' what 's so hard to figure about nancy ? '' burton asked. '' i do n't know. i 've been trying to — well , hit it off with her. it was no go. but as soon as i whispered the words to her that i was coming here to loot this place , that i knew you and that you knew exactly how to get us in , then she began to play up to me. i kinda get the idea that what she really wanted was not me , but to come here. and that makes no sense at all. because nobody in his right mind would want to come here !

'' you ai n't a thief , like me. you are , or you have been , a pretty big guy somewhere. no , do n't shake your head at me , i was n't born yesterday , i know an ex-big-shot when i see one. yet you came once to this city of zanadu when you were about dead — `` '' i told you i ha < s been a member of a scientific party and had gotten lost from it. '' burton said stiffly. the reason he had for getting lost from that scientific party was something he had no intention of revealing to anyone , let alone to malumby. '' yeah , you told me that , pal , but you never told me why you had gotten lost. '' '' why does anyone get lost ? '' burton answered irritably. he felt panic begin to rise in him. this red malumby , even if he was a thief and a killer , was nobody 's fool. he saw now that he had been making a grievous mistake about red malumby ; he had been underestimating him. red laughed. `` we wo n't argue about it , burton. we 'll let it go the way it lays. that 's only part of the stuff about you that i ca n't figure. the rest of it is : while you ai n't a thief , yet you are guiding us here to zanadu ; you are showing us how to get into the city , how to get ourselves accepted there. when we get together the pile of stuff we want and the ship lands to take us off , and it 'll land within twenty minutes after i get busy on the radio transmitter i got in this pack on my back— you will go away with us. at least you said you will — `` he looked questioningly at burton. '' i 'll go away with you , '' burton said harshly. `` i 'll have to go. i could n't stand staying there and facing duma shor , among other reasons. i 'll also take my fair share of the loot. '' '' why do you want any loot ? '' '' why— well — `` burton stuttered over the words. `` why does anybody want money ? '' malumby laughed again. `` okay , 70 we 'll let it go the way you want it. you 'll get your share ; to me , it do n't matter what you do with it. '' '' what do you want your share for ?

'' fvsx thing about this thief , he was shrewd. the question : how to answer him convincingly , how to lie to him ? burton thought about that , thought hastily and feverishly. he could see no way for him to think up a convincing answer on the spur of the moment. even an extra moment 's hesitation was in itself a kind of an answer. he did n't hesitate. '' i 've told you once , it 's my business , '' he answered. red malumby laughed. `` and that 's exactly the right thing to say to me , sometimes. if you had tried to lie to to me i might have been tempted to leave two corpses back there in the desert. two dead men would n't sit any heavier on my conscience than one. but you can tell me to go to hell —and i 'll do it. '' the glance he threw at burton was shrewd and appraising. `` you and me can get along together , burton. when we make our getaway from zanadu , and you get your private business finished , look me up. we 'll make a team that can go places. '' '' what if i do n't want to go your way ? '' burton answered. '' oh , each of us will have to make his own decision on that angle. if you want to go with me after we get finished here , i 'm ready. '' the man looked and sounded as if he meant every word he said. burton was too confused and too shocked to think. if he had lied , malumby might have killed him. the big thief was certainly capable of such an act. a shudder passed over burton. it had been so very close and he had not known it. there was one thing wrong with death. it came up and looked yon right in the eye and you did n't recognize it. he thought , with desperate bitterness , that there ought to be some sort of supernatural law which required death to wear a label , a placard saying i am death. but if death wore a label , the game would be much too easy. that was the way a man learned. or the way • a man died , if he made one mistake too many. richard burfon knew exactly and precisely the nature of the worst kind of a mistake a man could make. he had made one"

'' look , '' he told malumby. `` we ca n't go `` straight into zanadu. they would know we were coming there deliberately if we did that. no one who goes deliberately to zanadu terror out of zanadu 71 ever stays there long except martians , maybe. no human has ever done it. so we ca n't go straight there either.

'' that 's the only thing you 've ever really been thinking about.

'' sure , only four hundred dollars. and the whole world finds out what we 're on the search for. forget it , hayward. besides , i 'm told that when the gamma rays hit , you never know it* no one knows it , hayward thought , because no one had ever been hit by the full potency of a silonium gamma discharge. a three plus discharge had melted the flesh from the guinea pig. ■ ■ drake went on : `` be sensible , hayward. your contract remains effective only to the completion of the shaft to the main ore body. once we reach that you can tell me to go scratch. and you 'd still be a full partner ; i need you as much as you needed me. that 's why i paid the price i did for you — a full partnership. '' '' and do n't think i wo n't leave you flat the instant we reach the orebody ! '' hayward promised. `` so fast it 'll make your head spin. '' he did n't notice the quickly hidden look in drake 's eyes. the look that said drake had something in store for him that meant no good jim murchison rested the air chopper against the rock wall and looked with narrowed eyes at the. face of the wall before him. `` i do n't like it , lukel '' luke hayward , who was hunkered down by the side of the dump car , studied the stocky figure and stolid face of his head machine man. murchison was not the sort to get pessimistic unless there was real cause for it. `` why ? '' '' because the last three shotsbrought rock down on us from the tunnel roof. i 'm blowing sixty yards of ore every time i blast. something 's going to give ; '' '' vibration caused the falls , '' hayward said in reassurance. `` there 's a half mile of solid rock between us and that a world might live the flooded part. '' but murchison was n't assured. '' according to the plan we have. what are the facts , luke ? \ hayward understood what the other was driving at. they were digging straight into the side of the hill to get to the vein of silonium because the original shaft ,"

'' they 're the only plans we have , jim , '' hayward said. `` the happy chance mine is one of the oldest in arizona. you know that. the franciscan fathers worked it in the early seventeenth century , though they were only interested in the silver. of course the real value is in the copper ... '' murchison made a snorting sound. '' my aunt 's bustle ! copper ! you oughta know better than try to fool an old ore man like me , luke. what 's more , drake 's in on this deal. the war 's over and copper 's no longer a strategic mineral. he would n't monkey with copper. '' hayward rose to his full length and joined the other against the wall. suddenly he wanted to tell murchison the whole truth. `` maybe you should know , jim , '' he said. `` you 're right about it not being copper. it 's silonium i '' '' silonium ! '' '' yep ! and from the readings on my rynor counter , a vein of it. there are only two known deposits of the stuff — one in alaska , the other in mexico. '' '' how did you discover it ? '' '' that is n't the important thing , jim , '' hayward said. `` the little man 's got something at the back of his mind about this and knowing him , whatever it is wo n't do anyone good but himself. he 's power-mad , jim. '' murchison cocked his head to one side. `` sounds like the electric dump truck is coming. too early for the muckers. besides , they would n't use the power truck. drake , maybe ? '' '' probably. he knows we do n't have far to go. '' hayward was right. . . . ■p\rake was dressed in tailored breeches and boots and the shirt he wore was obviously of expensive material. he removed the miners ' helmet and wiped his brow with a fine square of linen.

'' '' i did n't hire you for what you did n't know. how far to go ? '' murchison gave the other his back and moved down the tunnel. `` ask hayward , '' he threw over his shoulder. '' well ... ?

'' drake shrugged. `` just did n't want you to get wet , '' he said. `` what do we do now , just stand around ? '' '' jim 'll be back in a second. he 's got the dynitro planted in the holes. he just went in to set up the fuses. '' '' good ! hot as hell in here. is it always this hot ? '' hayward smiled. `` yeah. those nice clothes wo n't look so laundered by the time you get out. '' drake looked at the stained and worn field clothes hayward wore. '' h'mm ! guess i should have worn something like you have on ... , what— what 's that ? '' hayward , too , had heard the shout. he did n't wait but set off at a run toward the spot from where murchison had called. the machine man 's voice had an odd note of terror behind its urgency. he barely stopped in time. murchison was backing along the tunnel in slow movement. the man was bent forward slightly and his hands were extended before him as though he were fending something off. '' jiml what 's wrong ? '' hayward grabbed murchison 's arms. '' something came out of the ground , '' murchison whispered. `` like the rounded end of a rocket. luke i it must have been ten feet in diameter. '' '' what 's that ? '' drake demanded. he was breathing heavily. he shoved hayward aside and pulled murchison around to face him. `` are you nuts , murchison ? '' murchison wrenched his arm free and shoved the smaller man against the wall. `` damn you ! do n't tell me i 'm crazy. i saw it , i tell you ! '' hayward rushed into the breech. '' whatever you saw , jim , is still there. let 's have a look. '' '' he must be drunk , luke , '' drake slid away from the wall. he brushed at the dust on his clothes while his eyes raked the stocky man with hatred. `` we did n't hear anything. '' '' we 'll know in a minute , '' hayward said. he took the lead. the other two followed in silence. 't'he only sound was the hoarse wheezing of drake 's terrified breathing. the entire tunnel was blocked by the strange shape. murchison had described it well. it looked like nothing more than an immense"

'' what the hell is it ? '' drake 's confidence returned when he saw that the strange metal thing was immobile. '' that 's not the important question , '' hayward said. he tapped the metal and skinned his knuckles. words came over the edge of his knuckles as he sucked at them : '' where did this thing come from ? that 's what i want to know. '' '' look ! '' murchison pointed with a stubby finger. `` dirt on the edges of the vanes. why , this thing is an earth borer. '' '' i 'll buy that , '' hayward said. '' those vanes dig the earth out and spill it to one side , which means the whole head revolves. fine ! does that answer my question ? '' drake 's sullenness returned , and with it , his attitude of authority. '' suppose we stop wasting our time , murchison , how about blowing this thing out of our way ? '' suddenly thunder filled the air , but as the sound of it died , words were to be distinguished . . . '' ... who are you ... who are you ? . . . '' they had fallen back before the terrible sound. now , as if in common protection , they huddled together. and again the metallic voice , `` who are you ? '' '' there 's someone in that thing , '' hayward whispered. `` walk backward slowly. easy now. . . '' '' stop ! '' the hidden voice called. that a world might live 87 '' not me , '' drake yelled. he turned to run and murchison followed his lead. only hayward held his ground. and from a hidden aperture a beam of blue light sped to envelope the three men in , in its paralyzing grip. they could not move the smallest muscle but they could see and hear. then the light disappeared but their paralysis remained. an opening spread in the dull *^ metallic hull until it was large enough for several men to pass through abreast. two figures showed against the dark background of the interior , both men. hayward saw their lips move but they were either too far from him or they were whispering , for no word of what was said came to his ears. then the men stepped out into the tunnel and walked slowly over to the frozen men. they were of about the same height but one was fairly young , the other obviously old. they wore close-fitting breeches and shirts and their feet were encased in high sandals. their heads were bare. now they were close enough for the three who were paralyzed by the strange blue ray to hear their voices.

'' '' very well , '' raynor said. he took a pencil-thin tube from a sheath attached to his belt , and pressed a tiny switch on the barrel. a spot of orange light touched each of the paralyzed men. and each fell into his own world of dark unconsciousness ... . tphe rhythmic beat of hidden * engines broke the rim of the dark world hayward was in. he stirred and opened his eyes and sat erect. he was between murchison and drake. both men were still out. hayward took in the strange room they were in as he shook his comrades until he felt them stir under his fingers. '' wha-what happened ? '' drake quavered. `` where are we ? '' '' inside that rocket-like thing , probably , '' hayward said wryly. `` take it easy , drake. they 'll let us know what this is all about , and in their own good time. this we do know. we 're going to visit someone called mydor. and they have the power to kill us. '' murchison suddenly stood and turned a glowering look to the room. '' we did n't have a chance. but maybe the next time we will. '' '' i do n't know , '' hayward said. '' that little tube packed dynamite. i wonder if they can regulate it for power ? '' '' we can , '' a hidden voice said. '' until it kills. please make yourselves comfortable. food will be served you soon and it wo n't be long until we reach the air lock at letta. then we will talk. '' '' let 's talk now , '' hayward spoke to the spot from where the voice seemed to issue from the wall. `` i 'd like to ask you people a few questions. '' '' later. there are questions we would like answered also. '' they had awakened to darkness , but as the voice died away light blossomed from a hidden source. they were in a prison without bars , a room without windows or doors , yet a room which was airy and light. metal furniture was fixed to the metal walls but the upholstery was soft and com fortable. and presently the food appeared en three trays which sped from a wall opening which closed as quickly as it had opened. there was a meat like roast beef , vegetables the likes of which they 'd never before tasted and a cup of something that was sweet and cool. hay ward set to eating immediately"

'' you 've got a suspicious soul , drake , but it should be obvious even to you if they wanted us dead they could have easily done so. go on , eat your food. unless you 're waiting for us to fall dead. '' '' sure. '' murchison took his lips from the rim of the cup. `` he 's only waiting to see if it affects us before he tries it. '' '' now wait a minute , '' drake said hastily. `` what the devil ! we 're all in this together. no use getting angry and imagining things. '' always the clever one , hayward thought. always looking for the ace in the hole. even words can buy men. that 's how he bought me — with words. '' y'know , '' murchison broke in on his thoughts , `` i 'm just a guy who works an air chopper— an ore man. but you , hayward , you 're a guy with brains and education. what does this figure for you ? '' even drake waited with held breath for hayward 's words. '' i do n't know the whole answer , but i 'll try a guess. first , this thing we 're in — ship or whatever you want to call it — came from below. but from where below ? far as we know there 's a thousand miles of solid rock beiow that tunnel. then again , the hidden voice spoke of an air lock at a place called letta. air locks are usually pressure chambers. my guess is that we 're going to a land which lies somewhere deep below the surface of the earth. right , hidden voice ? '' '' ri— `` the voice began , and stopped abruptly. hayward winked broadly at murchison. `` guess from here on in until we arrive , we talk of things like baseball or boxing . . . . `` tt might have been an hour , a day , a week that went by before the hidden engines stopped their purring. but suddenly while they were sitting , each wrapped in his own thoughts , a whole section of the wall slid into another section and a half dozen men were confronting them. at their head was the young one who had helped to capture them. he said , `` if nothing is attempted on your part , nothing will happen. do i make myself clear ? '' '' perfectly ! '' hayward took the lead. `` besides , i , for one , am too curious about all this to miss all the fun by having you knock me out with one of those tubes you carry.

'' and as an afterthought , '' . . .and you. . . '' '' thanks. '' hayward walked beside the other as if it were the most natural thing in the world. `` you speak excellent english. american in accent , i think. am i right ? '' '' yes. '' hayward noticed they were pacing down by a winding ramp. and shortly after , they were facing a closed door. by the attitude of their guards hay.ward guessed they were waiting a signal , so he continued with what he had been talking about. '' where did you learn the language ? '' that a world might uve 89 '' from a recording disk made in one of our exploratory outer surface ships. we all speak english. '' a light splashed a band of green over the top edge of the door. immediately hayward 's companion opened the door. he stood to one side and issued orders : `` the three of you take the single bench to the right. breathe through your mouths until you see the light above this door flash red. that will be the signal the pressure is normal. if you attempt to breathe through your noses you may find the pressure will puncture the ear drums. take your places now. '' hayward and his companions followed the other 's orders to the letter. it was not long before the signal flashed red. the youngster arose from where he had been sitting at the opposite door to the chamber and nodded for his squad to form. as they went forward one of the guards brushed against him by accident. the smile flashed suddenly on the youngster 's lips. and just as swiftly did his hand move to his belt where the tube lay encased by its sheath. once more the three saw the orange flame come from the tip of the tube , only now a white beam of light followed it , and small though the thread of light was , it was so brilliant it dazzled the eyes. when vision returned to the three captives it was to look with horror at a charred and twisted cinder on the metal floor. hayward breathed with difficulty and knew he was going to be sick in a second unless he could control himself. he turned his gaze upward to meet the smiling eyes of the young man. '' why did you do that ? '' he asked in a voice barely above a whisper. '' you killed him in cold blood ! '' '' a natural function , '' the youngster said. `` you are strange people. does it make any difference when slaves die ? '' he opened the door and the squad came to attention. three men were waiting them in the shallow room. one of the three was the one called raynor , the second was another man of about raynor 's age"

'' my lord. '' the youngster had snapped to instant salute at sight of the three. `` the prisoners , sire. '' k/iydor stepped forward and passed slowly back and forth in front of the three. his lower lip folded itself over the thin flesh of the upper. '' two laborers and a man of the upper classes. you ! who are you ? what is your rank ? '' drake , to whom mydor had addressed his questions , stiffened for an instant , then relaxed. his voice was unctious in reply : `` my name is manfred drake and i am the employer of these two. i am a financier. '' '' a strange word. is your attire common to your rank ? '' drake smiled. `` no , sire , '' the word came easily. `` these are the clothes i wore for comfort in the tunnel of the mine. '' mydor turned to his companions. he shook his head. `` i do n't know whether or not it was a waste of time. this midget and his slaves can not 90 be representative of what lies on the next level. i 'm sure. the exploratorydiscs brought back too many evidences of a superior race. these are obviously inferior. get rid of them. '' there was not an instant to be lost , hayward realized. already the arm of the youngster was moving toward the tube in his belt. `` if i may say something ... '' hayward said swiftly. mydor turned a questioning look. then raynor whispered something in mydor 's ear , and the other nodded. '' make it short , surface-man. '' '' the appearance of inferiority is deceptive. do not be misled , mydor. '' the cold face indicated interest. but only for a second , `` i see. well , perhaps i will have time. . .later. place them under guard , sopar , and see to it they do not escape. '' '' it was a lucky thing for you , '' sopar said , as they marched the length of the room , `` that raynor spoke in your behalf. inferiors can not address superior beings in atlantis.

'' nor were they the only imprisoned. there was a noticeable difference however. the walls were the ones enclosing the prison compound. the prison itself was a series of barred cages set one against another , each filled almost to bursting with men and women alike. the instant they came into the compound the stench of unwashed bodies greeted them. the odor was so bad drake instantly became sick. it was then they discovered the steel beneath the velvet gloves. sopar carried nothing but the tube in his belt. but the warders carried thonged whips. as drake bent over in nausea two of the warders began to lash at him with their whips. sopar stood to one side and watched , bright-eyed and smiling. hayward had a real hatred of drake , had always thought of him as the most insufferable human he had ever known. but this wanton beating of him was too much. in a flash he was on the nearest guard and before the man could turn , had wrenched the whip from his hand. as hayward pulled the whip free he saw sopar reach for the tube. sopar 's hand never made it. the whip lashed out and the end wrapped itself around his hand. before the atlantean could resist , hayward had dragged him close. sopar tried to bring the tube up but he seemed like a child in hayward 's grip. this fact stayed in the background of hayward 's consciousness for the moment. he tore the tube from sopar 's fingers. a wild scream of exultation rose on the air as hayward threw sopar to one side and leaped at the guard still beating drake. murchison , who had seemed to be stunned by the quick developments , came to drake 's aid also. in an instant there was a wild melee. '' do not kill them , '' sopar shouted as he staggered to his feet. `` mydor wants them alive. '' that a world might live 91 hayward seemed like a man gone mad. he lashed at the warders with hammering fists and each time a man was struck , he fell like a poled ox. nor were murchison 's blows less effective. but though the two of them fought with the fury of ten , the odds were altogether against them. sheer numbers finally brought them to the ground. and even there the fight was carried"

'' hayward opened his eyes and small as the movement was it brought a grunt of pain to his lips. opening his eyes had also reopened the gash over the eyebrow. he wiped the flow of blood away and brought his gaze to focus on the face bent above his. he could not guess her age , nor was he interested. he knew only that she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. her lips parted slightly to show perfect teeth and he heard the soft catch of her breath. then she let her breath out and her voice framed m `` oh. '' '' i 'm all right. '' he managed a smile. `` how are my friends ? '' '' none the worse for wear. can you manage to stand ? '' he pushed himself erect , and was immediately surrounded by a mob of prisoners. murchison elbowed his way to his side. now that he was erect , hayward saw that the girl was quite tall , only an inch or so under his own height , and she carried herself gracefully under the grey sacking she wore. he noticed the sacking seemed to be the common uniform for men and women alike. once more the girl spoke , and hayward noticed how immediate was the silence which followed her words , as if she was used to being heard , as if she was used to command. `` who are you and your friends ? we have never seen men of your kind before. is there an undiscovered land on atlantis we know nothing of ? '' '' a land above atiantisl we are from the surface of the earth. '' she shook her head in perplexity. '' i do n't understand. but that is n't important , i suppose. how did mydor get hold of you ? the 'smiling people ' do not like taking prisoners , unless , of course , you have some kind of value for him.

'' we have no chance by fighting them here , '' the girl said. `` our only chance may come when they release us.

'' '' the gate is open , '' raynor said. what kind of prison is it ? hayward wondered as he shoved his way to the gate and pulled it inward. his eyes moved upward and he realized why they did not fear any attempt at escape. manning saw what looked like a pair of searchlights atop the wall , and eight or ten of the guards. the searchlights were directed toward the cages. hayward had. an idea that a blue beam would spray them should there be any attempt at escape. '' mydor awaits you£ raynor said shortly as the guards closed in on hayward and his two companions. '' come. . . '' that a world might live 93 'tthey had been ushered into mydor 's personal chamber of the palace. sopar had disappeared shortly after they left the car , but raynor remained. now he stood beside mydor who was seated on what appeared to be a gold throne. raynor looked at mydor who gave a short nod , and raynor addressed them : '' his majesty , king mydor , monarch of all atlantis , avowed conquerer of the surface world from which we were exiled , has granted an audience to you from the surface world , and an opportunity to aid in the conquest of that world from which you come. '' within a short time armies and armaments will be ready for their greatest and most glorious action. nothing will avail against them. for so it was said in the prophecy , and so shall it be. '' hayward felt all this was the preamble to the important things to follow. it was a build-up which was proscribed. '' . . .because of the vastness of the undertaking , certain measures must be taken into consideration. our exploratory discs have shown and recorded the fact that atomic weapons are in use on the surface. we , too , have a knowledge of those weapons. we have found that there is now an element , called silonium"

'' the great , wisdom of our king made easily understandable your presence in the tunnel. you , also , were searching for the vein. only you knew its exact whereabouts. '' hayward let nothing of what waa in his mind show in his expression. '' what do you want of us ? to give you the exact location ? '' '' precisely ! '' raynor said. '' not a chance , '' hayward said softly. '' that 's telling them ! `` murchison growled. raynor smiled. hayward felt a quiver of cold run through him. he had learned what their smile meant. '' we shall discover it eventually , '' raynor said softly. `` with or without your help. it will only expedite matters , with your help. '' '' i 'm ready to help , '' drake said. he stepped forward until he was out of hayward 's reach. `` this man is my engineer. he knows exactly where the vein is. '' but drake was mistaken about being out of hayward 's reach. hayward took a couple of quick steps and did what he had always wanted to do. drake was lifted off his feet by the blow and fell in a crumpled heap almost at mydor 's feet. instantly the guards who were in the room converged on hayward and murchison with drawn tubes. but mydor raised a plam in a languid gesture. the guards fell back. '' you see , raynor ? '' he said. `` i said you were but wasting time with these. i should never have let you talk me into granting an audience. inferior beings. obviously. we need only send up several of the rocket machines and one of them will strike the right place. how much more simple it wil ! be that way. besides , thess will furnish the people with sport. the first of the hordes of surface prisoners. '' daynor bit his hp. it was obvious he was worried about something. '' great lord , '' he said softly. `` how right you are. '' he turned to face the two. `` decide now. death or freedom. '' hayward 's mind worked swiftly 94 and desperately. `` would you answer a single question , raynor ? '' '' ask it. '' '' if we hesitate it 's because we have been brought into the strangest adventure of our lives. a planet within a planet , a world of people which history said disappeared thousands of years ago. but here you are and have been through the ages. now we are being asked to make a decision that is the hardest we have ever known. we are being asked"

'' we will let the people of the surface world destroy themselves. our plans are simple. we will manufacture a number of silonium atom bombs , send up the discs and have the bombs dropped at various places. the nations of the surface world are ready to go to war on an instant 's notice. each will think the other is attacking. when the carnage is over , when the nations are helpless , we will attack. '' hayward tried to swallow the cotton which had formed in his craw. what sort of devilish beings were these ? he wet his lips , felt an anger that was like seething metal take hold of him. but before he could say anything , raynor spoke again , this time to mydor. '' let me speak to them privately , '' he said. `` a few moments alone with them and i think i can convince them of the wise course to follow. '' mydor nodded. `` very well , raynor. not too long , though. i wish to discuss the games for tomorrow. mama and her followers should make fine entertainment for the people.

'' mydor is insane , '' were the first words he said. `` yes. we must stop him. he will commit our world and yours to destruction. i surprise you ? '' '' brother , and how , '' hayward said , matching the other 's low tones. '' it would be a quick death for me if i acted otherwise , '' raynor went on. `` somehow you must be placed on the earth-machine so that you can get back to your people and warn them. you must agree to mydor 's demands. '' '' you 're against him , then ? '' hayward asked. '' the only one in a high place who is. the others are like him— utterly mad. no wonder we are called the 'smiling people ' by others , and with hate in their voices. we kill with a smile on our lips. kill and torture. let me think a moment.

'' hayward looked at murchison , who nodded. but drake refused to meet hayward 's eyes. hayward smiled. no need to worry about drake , he that a world might live 95 thought. he 's too scared to be of hindrance. besides , all he wants to do is get back. '' yes , '' hayward said. '' good. then follow my lead , '' raynor said. i i oy lord ! `` raynor bowed iv1 low. '' yes ? '' mydor said languidly from his throne.

'' your lips are trembling with words , '' raynor said. `` let them spill out. '' '' explain all this.

'' whether it was the truth or not , hayward thought , no one would believe him should he somehow manage to get back to the earth. suddenly a heart-shaped face appeared in the mirror of his mind. marnal he felt his pulses stir at her memory. '' what kind of game is going to be played tomorrow ? '' he asked. tired lines made wrinkles in the drawn face of the old man. `` marna and her people will be put to death , after they have been tortured. '' . '' why ? '' raynor sighed. `` for no reason other than to satisfy mydor 's innate cruelty. once there were three peaceful cities. now there is only letta ; the others were destroyed by mydor , and their people used as slaves or placed under arms , or used in the great games. marna was the queen of hegga until he attacked her city. now she is awaiting her death and praying it will come quickly.

'' that opportunity is now at hand. '' the old man was all right , hayward decided , despite his windiness. he felt the weight of the sword raynor had provided , against the flesh of his thigh. it was an unaccustomed weight but felt better than anything he had ever known before. suddenly his head lifted. the car had stopped. '' we are here , '' raynor said. `` and may luck follow before us. '' a cordon of guards were drawn up before the squat building housing the power plant. one who was the leader came forward with a belligerent strut , a strut which changed to stiff attention at sight of raynor. '' acquaint the one in charge of my visit , '' raynor commanded. the man saluted , turned on his heel and disappeared into the building. ke was back shortly , showing the way to raynor and his group. a stocky man in grey coveralls was waiting them within the entrance. he waved the leader of the guards away , saying , `` there is no need for you , captain. the king 's councilor needs no supervision. ah. are these the ones from the surface ?

'' the power 's gone , '' murchison shouted. `` now we can strikel '' cwiftly hayward led the way to the outside. the guards showed only faint surprise at the sudden exit. too late did they realize something was wrong. by that time the group had made good its escape. '' the alarm will go out swiftly now , '' raynor said. `` but we have the advantage. we know where we are bound ; mydor is in the dark. '' '' how long before we reach the pr/son walls ? '' hayward wanted to know. '' not too long , at our speed. that is , if we are not stopped ? '' '' to hell with that ! '' hayward said. '' i 've noticed this thing runs like one of our autos. '' the man at the wheel moved over and hayward took his place. `` hang onto your hats , '' hayward said. '' we 're going places in a hurry. '' '' this road leads straight to the prison. '' raynor leaned over hayward. `` it will be a little while until the alarm is out , enough time for us to get there. '' '' luke ! '' murchison called from the back of the car. his voice had a pleased note to it. `` we 've mislaid drake. '' hayward spun the wheel about in a frantic move as he barely missed another vehicle at an intersection. '' what do you mean ? '' '' guess he was too slow , '' murchison said. `` he ai n't here. '' '' then we 'll have to go back for him , '' hayward said grimly. '' why ? he 's no damned good , and we 'd all be better off if he stayed down here. '' '' maybe.

'' '' i suppose , '' hayward said. he whipped the car about again. 98 presently they were in the open and in a short time the low prison walls loomed before them. hayward stopped the car at raynor 's direction at the center gate. a captain of the guards opened the gates at sight of the visitor. hayward and murchison acted as though they were prisoners , and to add to the effect raynor 's personal bodyguard drew their tube guns and held them in readiness. '' i am returning the prisoners , '' raynor said. the captain turned to call warders and raynor put out his hand quickly. '' my men will conduct the prisoners , captain. if you do n't mind ? '' '' not at all , if it is your desire. '' '' thank you. come along , then. '' in his desire to walk at raynor 's side , the captain stepped between the bodyguard and prisoners and accidentally bumped against murchison. a startled expression dawned in the man 's eyes. `` the prisoner ! he 's armed i '' those were his last words. another second and the alarm would be raised. with a gesture surprisingly swift for an old man raynor whipped out the short sword concealed under his shirt and ran it through the captain. the man died without a sound. it was the signal for all of them to draw their weapons. '' to marna 's cage i `` hayward shouted. without waiting to see what the others would do he set off at a run for the cage shouting as he did : '' get outl you 're freel get out of the cages ! `` his words aroused not only the prisoners but also the guards. men boiled from their quarters at the far end of the compound and their figures showed on the wall as they ran to the huge ray machines. but when they turned them on , nothing happened. just as when those on the ground attempted to blast the escaping prisoners , nothing happened. in the meantime hayward and the others had reached the cage where marna was imprisoned. he made his voice heard above the voices of the excited prisoners. '' get their weapons ! get their weapons ! '' '' you came back for me ! '' marna 's voice was warm and low. he turned to see the woman he had come for standing beside him. her beauty was a spark that set his heart aflame. he had never imagined that when love would come it would come so quickly , so completely without question. a queen ! and she loved him. it was to be seen in her eyes , felt on her lips as"

'' it was amazing how quickly her subjects rallied around her. individual fights raged about the compound but now it was apparent that some sort of order was being formed by the guards. small groups of them under the leadership of one man or another , pitted themselves against many of the escaping prisoners and hacked them to pieces before a defense could be organized. '' we 've got to have weapons , '' marna said. `` attack the guards. '' tt was an order. hayward was shocked by it because it meant a command to suicide for many ; having no weapons marna 's followers had to take arms from the guards by sheer force of numbers. then he saw the sense of it. men had to be sacrificed to gain the end marna was after : control of the prison compound and the weapons. that a world might live 99 as if it was the most natural thing in the world , he took command of their immediate group. using raynor , murchison , the four bodyguards and himself as a nucleus , he hacked his way to the gate through a horde of guards. steel ripped his clothing to shreds , razor-sharp sword edges nicked him time and again and once a wild swing of one of the guards almost took his head from his shoulders. but luck stayed with him. he ducked in time and his own blade swung up and out , to stream red with blood as it went completely through the man. what hayward had noticed when he took the tube away from sopar was evident now. his own strength was superhuman , or the atlanteans were much weaker than earthmen. ey the time they reached the gate a large number of mama 's followers were armed. more and more came to join them until their force numbered hundreds. the guards had been forced to fight a retreating action. suddenly the withdrawal to the gates became a riot. '' let them gol '' hayward gave the command. `` mania , have some of your men guard the women and take them to safety. raynor ... '' the old man 's arms hung heavily at his side and the face was lined with weariness. blood dripped from a cut on his cheek , but the old eyes were ablaze with fight , and there was no question of the great spirit in that frail body.

'' quick ! along both sides of the road. hide in the grass until we learn if they are friends. raynor , you and murchison take one group ; i will take another. get moving ! '' tthere was no longer any question as to who had come. the first two out of the lead car were mydor and sopar. the youngster raised his sword in a signal and men streamed from the hundred vehicles. the voice of mydor , coldly contemptuous , was suddenly raised in command : `` take no prisoners. neither man nor woman. '' '' i 'm going to wipe that look from mydor 's face , '' hayward whispered to marna. `` besides , we need those cars. one thing. i do n't want you in this thing. '' '' you ca n't keep me out , '' she said. there were many things about her he knew nothing of. he knew only that he loved her , and felt certain his love was returned. but there was time for learning more. was it an hour they had spent together in the same cage ? a day ? he knew it was a lifetime , now. and no matter how short the time , it had been long enough for him to know life held no large meaning without her. he shook his head , but smiled as he did so. '' i ca n't take a chance , '' he whispered. `` you heard mydor 's words. '' '' we had nothing but our hands before , '' she said. `` now there is steel in them. i am their queen , and i must lead them. '' he swallowed hard. this was not conpa city , arizona , or even the earth on which that hamlet stood. this was a band of rock , a layer of a planet , a world like something in a 100 dream , the home of a people who had disappeared from the earth thousandsof years before. he could not break the bonds of their customs by using phrases familiar to him. he cupped his hand under her chin and lifted her face to his and kissed her hard and she brought her body close to his so that he felt the swelling breasts quivering against his flesh and knew for a wild instant the depths of passion in this strange woman. then he pushed her gently from him and nodded once. she had won. he stood erect , a figure of pent-up power , his face a mask of flaming anger , his hand with the sword clenched in a fist thrust straight out before him. • '' '' this time the battle was another ■ kind. the guards"

'' it 's a hopeless cause , '' raynor muttered. '' not yet , '' hayward made answer. '' this fight , maybe ; but i think we can get away. '' he looked about and counted some twenty men who were in their group. `` if we can get to mydor 's craft. . . `` once more raynor 's face lit up with renewed hope. `` if we can , it will be clear sailing to the city. his insignia will let us through. '' '' what are we waiting for then ? '' hayward asked. his now-familiar bellow of defiance rose on the air , and sweeping the girl close to his side he charged the thin wall of warriors facing them. the suddenness of the attack cleaved a crack in the thin line , and seconds later the fight raged about the torpedo-shaped car. marna , too raised her voice in a last desperate attempt to rally her dwindling forces. they responded nobly , forcing drained nerves and muscles to give their last reserve of strength in her honor. men fell and were trampled by others who made frantic efforts to reach the enemy , until a wall of dead lay heaped about the car. the screams of the wounded and dying rose in a horrible souhd , like a hymn to death. so close were they jammed that men died and were held erect by the press of others. there was no room for swinging , only for stab and thrust. for an instant the battle hung in the balance , and hayward called on his reserve of power. his great figure , naked now to the waist ,"

'' we 've lost raynor. what do we do dow ? '' a warrior crawled panting to hayward 's side. `` i have been trained as pilot. there are two space craft on a field outside the city. '' '' like the one that brought us to letta ? '' hayward asked. '' better. these are larger and are more powerful and swifter , mydor constructed them for the day of invasion. each can hold ten thousand men ! '' a laugh that bordered on hysteria rushed from hayward 's throat. to think a man could be that mad as to attempt invasion of the earth with twenty thousand men. but the laugh died almost as quickly as it was born. he suddenly remembered what he had been told. the mysterious discs were to bring the silonium bombs to the earth and drop them. the discs ! flying saucers. . . . but how had they been brought to the earth ? what difference did it make now that he knew their purpose , past and future. he had to get back to the earth and somehow warn its nations. hayward felt the sudden press of warm woman 's flesh against his shoulder. `` marna , my dearest. . . '' she whispered , `` i go where you go. here life is done for me. '' his bloody hand rose to caress her shoulder but fell back to the wheel. he"

'' there was a laugh of exultation behind the man 's words. `` mydor made it simple for us. i know. i was head of raynor 's bodyguards and knew all of the mad king 's plans , as well as did my dead master. the pilot control is set. it was set the instant raynor and sopar came back with you and your friends. there was only the wait for the proper moment. there is even a stock of provisions on board. '' for the first time since the battle had been joined , hayward heard murchison 's voice. `` food , '' murchison said wistfully. `` what 's that ? godi even crumbs would be welcome. '' '' you 'll have to hold out , jim , '' hayward said. '' hold outl my aunt 's bustle ! there 's nothing to hold out with. my 102 belly 's saying hello to my backbone. '' '' turn off the road here ! '' the warrior called suddenly. `` it 's only a short distance. '' t_iayward had never dreamed such a ship could be constructed to be made to fly. he had not known the size of the ship they had come in but had realized it was immense. but this thing before them ; it was colossal ! his eyes trained to gauge size , made the craft out to be a thousand feet in length and two hundred feet through the middle. the head of it was fifty feet at the widest , and each vane was a foot long. it seemed incredible. but even more incredible was the small number of men set to guarding it. at sight of the royal insignia the guards snapped to attention. too late did they discover the deception. by the time they saw it , hayward and the others were on them. hayward and the others were not to be denied. the guards died to a man i '' show us what to do , '' hayward ordered. '' there wo n't be much to show , '' the warrior said. `` the automatic pilot is set and the course has been laid for it. come. we get in through the belly. '' hayward and the warrior had been talking close by the ship while the others stood about waiting their decision. suddenly one of them turned idly and what he saw made his voice rise in a shout of warning. '' i see the lights of cars coming swiftly ! '' '' quickly ! '' the pilot waved them forward. `` inside. '' he reached up against the dull metal and pressed a knob which protruded and instantly an opening spread and a ladder unfolded its length to the ground."

'' '' look , luke ! it 's drake ! '' murchison bawled wildly. `` he 's with mydor. '' murchison had seen right. the tiny figure of manfred drake was to be seen at mydor 's side. suddenly there was nothing to be seen. it was as if a screen had been pulled before their eyes. the two turned questioning looks at the pilot. '' we 're in flight , '' came the matterof-course answer. as on their flight from earth neither murchison nor hayward knew the passage of time. murchison spent most of his time with the pilot. but hayward knew only that here , in this brief moment , was his chance to know mania. nor was she lukewarm to the idea. but in both minds there lurked the dread thought of what the future would bring when both ships landed. they knew the speed of both was about the same and that from what the pilot said both ships would land not too far from each other in the tunnel. this also they knew. the fight to the finish would come then , and as before it would be hand-tohand ; the ray weapons were sti ! ) useless. so hayward and marna learned ihe sweetness of love while they had the chance. while , in the darkness of outer space between the bands of planets , their ship sped on its destined course. that a world might live 103 they were walking the narrow deck close by the pilot 's compartment when murchison dashed from it. '' marnal luke ! we 're coming in ! '' they could feel the deceleration as they grouped themselves over the pilot 's shoulders. '' watch , '' the pilot said without taking his eyes from the dials on the board. `` very soon , now. '' directly ahead lay a broad plain. but as they came closer they saw that what had appeared to be flat land was really mountainous country. and so quickly it almost took their breaths away they were flying between two huge basalt-like needles of mountains into what must have once been a crater. seconds later darkness enfolded them in its sable wings. the pilot slid from his seat. `` that 's all , '' he said. `` i 've set the alarm to let us know when we are through. '' hayward nodded soberly. `` might as well get ourselves set for the last battle.

'' a sudden thought struck hayward. '' are we on the same path as the one who came before ? '' '' i do n't know , '' came the answer. '' but not far off , i 'm sure. '' cuddenly there was silence. ^ `` let 's go ! '' hayward shouted. he had given them their instructions. murchison and several others were to hurry mama back along the tunnel to freedom while he and the rest fought off mydor. hayward knew there simply was n't room in the tun nel for effective fighting. two men could hold off hundreds. he made a silent vow he would be one of the two until death took them , or rescue came. the ship came to a halt with a jar which threw them all off balance. seconds later the last of them were through the hatchway. murchison and the girl and another raced off while hayward waited for the other ship to come through. the seconds that went by were eternities. for there was horrible uncertainty of not knowing where the other ship would come through. they could all die without having a chance to strike a blow should the nose come through at the spot where they waited. hayward 's lips twisted in a crooked grin. he thought suddenly what might happen should they come in where the vein lay. and with that thought came another. the dynitro ! it was all ready to be set off. murchison had set the charge. if the ship came through between the charge and their ship. . . ? there was a single wild chance to take. if it succeeded they were all saved. '' wait here ! '' he yelled , and set off at a run toward the end of the tunnel. the wires and battery were all set up. hayward grabbed them up , whirled and whipped back toward where the others were waiting. he was racing against two things : one , he did n't know when or where the other ship would come through ; and second , he and the others had to get around the nose of their ship in tune. he made it back with only seconds to spare. just as he came to a panting halt , there was an unearthly roar , and a vast mass shot up through the floor of the tunnel. hayward turned , 104 handed the battery to the pilot and yelled above the tumult : '' quickly , get behind our ship , roll the wires out a bit more , and push the plunger down !

'' hayward gauged the distance and saw that there was perhaps a hundred feet from where the tunnel ended to where the nose of the second ship pointed its dull metal upward. the blast would kill every man between the two ships. '' all of you , '' he amended his order. `` get behind our ship with the pilot. i 'll give the signal. '' jljydor was the first to step from the ship. behind him came drake. seconds later a nundred men stood grouped about the nose of the ship. mydor 's face was devoid of expression. '' a long chase , '' mydor said. `` but now it is ended , and we have arrived at our goal. '' '' not quite , '' hayward said. '' oh , but we have. you see , your friend drake , here , is going to act as my emissary when our invasion has begun. he made it plain the people of your planet are stupid , and your tale will be laughed at. '' '' that 's right , hayward , '' drake said. `` you know how right i am. and something else. our contract is ended , as of this moment. '' hayward had noticed a surreptitious movement of the men toward him. another moment and they would charge. '' now ! '' his voice rang out. and with a simultaneous lunge , he hurled himself forward and threw the sword with all his might at drake. there was the sound and fury and flame of a huge explosion and the last thing hayward saw was the body of drake pierced through by the sword , fall to the ground. then all sight vanished in blackness ... . utte ca n't die ! '' a soft voice sobbed. `` he ca n't ! '' luke hayward opened his eyes and saw the most beautiful eyes in the world looking pleadingly into his own. '' die ? '' he repeated painfully. '' darling , i 've just started to live ! '' he turned his glance away from hers and saw murchison kneeling beside the girl. he was grinning broadly , and hayward knew the adventure was ended. except for love , and who feared that ? the end"

'' without waiting for an answer , he had turned back to the stack of papers in front of him. bobby shook his head and trudged from the room. adults , he thought , were funny— almost as funny as the man he 'd heard thinking. he went through the kitchen , scooping up some more matches when his mother was n't looking. there was a tree in the edwards ' back yard , a towering beech which had often served as the jungle which was tarzan 's special domain. bobby swung up into it , hooked his knees over a limb , rested his shoulders against another and relaxed. he struck a match on the trunk and stared at the flame. the thoughts had come more clearly when he had held the burning match ... . the boy who cried wolf 359 109 t_je was still at it when his mother called him to lunch , but he obediently snuffed the match out against the tree and slid to the ground. knowing that it was necessary , he detoured through the bathroom , dabbed bits of water on his face and then used the towel to rub off the smudges of dirt. he slid into his place at the table just as his father entered the dining room.

'' while he washed th« sandwich down with milk , bobby debated the possibility of arguing the point now or waiting until he had added the new information. he decided on the latter. '' it ai n't just a visit , '' he said , `` like i thought at first. they 're coming to fight us. '' '' do they still look like fires ? '' bobby nodded.

'' '' no , sir— except that everybody in town ought to be warned and everybody ought to be out there when they come. i — i think they 're afraid of water and maybe of guns — at least , they 're afraid we 'll have some sort of terrible weapons.

'' carly the next morning , as soon as he finished breakfast , bobby went to his room and put on his hopalong cassidy shirt and pants. he buckled on his belt and holster , tying the holster down to his leg. he stood in front of the mirror and twirled his western hero gun several times and then jammed it into the holster. after some thought , he dug up another old holster and rigged it up to fit under his armpit , out of sight beneath his buckskin vest. he fitted his repeater water pistol in to this and swaggered from the room. '' thank heavens , '' he heard hi3 mother say as he left the house , `` he 's reverted to being a cowboy again.

'' '' nah , '' sonny said scornfully. `` we played the martians are coming last week — and you made me be the martians. besides i 'm building— something. '' he was mysterious , but bobby was n't interested. instead , he brushed aside the mystery with a careless wave and went on. he skirted the university campus and shortly came out on the edge of the forest. entering the forest , he began to slip from tree to tree , going so quietly that not a single squirrel scolded him for the invasion. a few minutes later he reached the spot , deep in the woods , where there was a slight clearing. it was there that he was sure the ship would land. he crouched behind a giant oak and"

'' look what we have , bobby , '' he said. `` it 's one of the newest chemistry sets. i 've just been reading the instructions and if we take this bottle of uranium and — `` he went on in a very real excitement and bobby began to catch some of it. a few minutes later , the two of them were busily bringing about a minor atomic explosion , while the universe city firemen were putting out the last of the blaze in hutchins forest. one of the firemen unknowingly stepped on a piece of twisted metal and trod it deep into the ground. and the chemistry set was such a success that the loss of one western hero cap pistol was never noticed. chrxl landed the ship on the flame-port and , breathing deeply , walked through the swirling fire to report. '' shrxl reporting , '' he thought to his commander , `` with one dead. prtzl was killed by an inhabitant of the world we visited. my report is that the third planet of the sun we observed is unfit for habitation. it now supports some form of native life — extremely condensed so it must be of a low order — which is too dangerous. so barbarous are they that even their young carry the deadliest weapons known to the universe. one such young animal murdered prtzl and drove the rest of us away. we must find a more civilized world. '' shrxl 's report was accepted without being believed. for centuries the flame-men had known the thoughts of the strange life on that third planet. they knew it was a mighty race , because it had no fear of water , and they respected the intelligence of the race , had in fact borrowed from that intelligence even to accepting its name for their home world."

'' '' sure. the only ships pluto 's got that could catch us are too small to hurt us. and the big ones are a little too slow.

'' the jupecats ran to four inches in length and had no claws , but why make dimpo feel bad ? then ensign fuller had to come along again and glower at the weeb. the tears came once more , with renewed force. iit ook , '' crag said to the captain. '' i know how you feel about weebs. but we learned this much living with dimpo : a weeb 's got intuition. if dimpo feels this bad , something 's going to happen. '' beside him , morris , another prospector , said , `` no fooling , captain. '' they had left dimpo in the care of the other three , for which mackey was thankful. he was no more superstitious than any other spaceman , but no less. '' those pluto ships are acting funny , and that 's a fact , '' he admitted. in the last half hour the dark ships of pluto had grown slightly larger on the screen , but not much. they were definitely not trying too hard to close for battle. and that fact , among others , was making mackey suspicious. pluto had less ships of the first line than earth. pluto 's ships were slower and no better armed. then why had pluto declared war suddenly , not even trying to take advantage of a sneak attack ? it did n't make sense , not to a man like mackey , who knew how important even a five hundred mile an hour advantage could be. '' captain ! '' the radarman called. '' those ships are carrying some kind of shields ! '' mackey looked at the screen , saw that only two ships remained , and that those had grown larger. he rubbed his jaw. '' we 're just about in range. give them a blast. '' deep within the virtus there was the whine of a roton. a long finger of light flicked out at the closer dark ship and fell short by a thousand miles. in reply there came a beam from the dark ship , also falling short. but there was now a change on the screen. the ships of pluto were holding back. mackey rubbed his jaw again. '' they 're steering clear. so it is n't an anti-neutron shield , otherwise they would n't be scared of our beam. '' he had a difficult decision to make. with jupiter so close now his massthrust advantage had grown. at the very least he could figure a five minute lapse before the other plutonian ships caught up."

'' '' surrender or die , '' the c.o. 'replied laconically. everybody laughed , breaking the tension that had built up. `` reply ? '' the c , o. asked. the way of a weeb 133 '' no , '' mackey told him. `` they might have a lady on board. and i could n't think of a nice way to word it. '' amid more laughter the radarman said , `` two man scout ship out ! '' they watched the tiny ship break away from its darker mother ship and hurl itself toward the virtus , too small to carry heavy weapons , the scout ship was also small enough to outspeed the virtus. and if it got close enough it could do sufficient damage to cripple the earth ship. watching the tiny thing come on , mackey also saw a larger pattern evolving. he sucked in a jubilant breath. '' get set for a one degree swing left ! '' he barked , he watched the scout ship bore in closer. '' nail it ! '' the beam flicked out again , like a snake 's tongue darting. it touched the scout ship briefly. for an instant a miniature sun blazed , and then was gone , and with it the tiny ship. '' now ! '' mackey yelled. the virtus heeled over , running wide open now with mackey babbling almost incoherently to himself. he was going to catch the two plutonians in line with each other. he was going to execute the beautiful and ancient naval maneuver of crossing the tl '' now ! '' he crooned. they witnessed the awesome spectacle of a great ship atomizing , all its fissionables going at once. at a distance of millions of miles it would appear as a new star being born. up close there was nothing but light. light so incredibly bright that when it was gone the blackness of space was more intense than ever. < ( 1vi y g0d `` said ensign fuller , a shocked for once into humility by what he had seen. for the rest there was a momentary silence. no shouting , no back slapping , no jubilation. for an instant they had looked into the furnace of creation , all except mackey for the first time. they felt hollow inside. and then"

'' sure , sure , '' crag said soothingly. he patted dimpo 's furry head. '' what i saw , '' dimpo said. he had been looking through a porthole. '' oh , what i saw ! '' '' i know , i know. '' and over dimpo 's wailing the radarman said , `` captain ! something funny. that lone baby is trying to stick to us , not even waiting for its friends. '' mackey looked and it was true. the remaining plutonian ship was riding parallel , instead of running or falling away as it should have. '' we 'll knock them off too , '' ensign fuller exulted , and some of the younger officers joined him , their adrenals pumping again in the hope of a two-strike. mackey disregarded them , his thin , lined face set in the memory of other battles , the knowledge lying heavy within him that no two battles ever had the same pattern. he had gambled his ship once in the hope of learning something. but he had learned nothing. so far there was no ace up pluto 's sleeve. and that did n't make sense. nobody ever declared war in the certainty of losing. '' are n't they doing anything ? '' he fretted. the radarman twirled his knobs , trying for more detail. `` something , '' 134 he said. `` they just kicked off another one. '' '' scout ? '' '' no sir. smaller. too small for even a one man job. '' mackey watched the thing grow on the screen from a pinpoint to an object the size of an orange. definitely too small for even a one man job , he thought. and not moving fast enough , although faster than his own ship could travel. '' give it a burst , '' he ordered. his gunners were good. they hit it perfectly , the computers recording the object enveloped by the beam. they found themselves waiting for the flash. only this time there was no flash. the object was now the size of a very large orange. mackey cursed. `` something wrong with the detonator. check it ! '' '' it checks , '' he was told. they hit it again with the beam , and somehow mackey and all of them knew that it was no good even before the beam touched it. nothing was going to happen , and nothing did. there was nothing to do but run. the thing was only thirty feet or so in length , trailing white flame that twisted into corkscrew shapes as it twisted and turned and dodged , mimicking every move"

'' what happened ? '' someone asked. they had seen the flash behind them and sensed the explosion that must have caused it , even seeming to feel the concussion of such a blast , although it was impossible for them to have actually felt it.

'' mackey knew , but the knowledge was bitter as gall in him , for there was not a single thing he could do with it. his face was wan and gray with the weight of the knowledge. '' they dragged out the old proximity fuse , '' he said. `` they tuned it to the metal of our hull and stuck an old fashioned molecular explosive ^ warhead on it and used a molecular motor for the rocket.

'' captain mackey 'll get us out of this. that 's how he got all those medals on his chest , getting out of tough spots.

'' more than ever , '' mackey agreed. he pointed at a porthole and said , '' have a look.

'' crag i '' he screamed. and then just a long scream of terror. too late he realized what he had done. the two shapes were stopped. now they were moving again , but now they were moving purposefully. he 'd given himself away. he 'd given crag away , he 'd given all of them away ! they had n't known there was anyone around. they 'd just been moving along , and they might just as well have passed within fifty feet of crag or himself and never known. but now they knew. coming from off to the right , they could n't see crag yet. but in another minute or so they would."

'' he repeated the call over and over into the microphone , a pleading note in his voice. but the loudspeaker remained silent. it had been silent all evening. he had repeated his call at half-hour intervals , but there had been no answer. there had been no answer tor a week. frowning at the silent loudspeaker , bradley dunn lighted a cigarette. he thought back over the nightmare events of the past week , and he wondered if they formed the reason for her silence. he had learned little about the girl in the brief month of their short-wave radio acquaintance. he knew that her name was faye manning , that she seemed to be a radio ham like himself — but that was about all. faye manning. ... a voice from a short-wave radio loudspeaker. a voice belonging to a girl he had never seen. yet that voice had formed a picture of her in his mind. it had told him things about her that she had never 9 10 put into words. it was soft , cultured , breaking frequently into clear , silvery laughter. it held no affectation , no coyness or pretense. it contained warmth and sincerity , a quick intelligence that carried her easily over a wide range of knowledge. her voice further told him that she was an attractive girl , even though it seemed unlikely that an attractive girl would indulge in a hobby as sedentary as short-wave radio. she had the youth and vitality , the self-confidence and zest for life that went with good looks. in three years of short-wave radio broadcasting dunn had learned a lot about voices. but in those three years he had never encountered a voice quite like faye manning's. it held an inexplicable magnetism , a challenge. it was a voice that both revealed and concealed. for there was also an odd yet persistent quality of mystery about her. she avoided speaking of herself or her surroundings , somehow always managing to keep their conversations on an impersonal basis. there were times when she had seemed downright furtive — conspiratorial. her radio contacts with him had been brief , hurried , made in a lowpitched tone as though she wished to avoid being overheard. hphe last time he had spoken to her— almost exactly a week ago— there had been a restrained excitement in her words , a hidden tension. . .a hint of dread.

'' he had pressed for an explanation , trying desperately to prevent losing contact with her , even temporarily. his existence had come to center about his talks with her , and the thought of having them interrupted had been as unpleasant to face as that of giving up such a vitally necessary function as sight. '' what is it , faye ? '' he had asked , '' is there something i can do ? '' '' i 'm afraid not. in fact , i do n't know if i 'd want anything done. this thing that 's happened. . .well , it 's important , brad. in a lot of ways. i 'll have to sign off now. i 'll get in touch with you later , if i can.

'' he had not heard from her since. he crushed out the cigarette with sudden violence and ran a hand through his thick brown hair. loneliness and discontent showed in the pucker between his hazel eyes , in the downward curve of his wide mouth. his features were mobile and sensitive , clashing with the rugged strength that lay in his wide cheekbones and the angularity of his jaw. he turned away from the radio set in a surge of restlessness , and abruptly he was aware of the silence that filled the bungalow , a silence that seemed to settle most heavily in this particular room. he ran a bitter gaze over the littered workbench near the short-wave apparatus , over the tool cabinet and the tier of laden shelves beside it , over the studio couch and the large , overflowing bookcase against the opposite wall. the familiarity of the room mocked him. it was a reminder , a symbol of the emptiness of his life. he was twenty-eight , an electronics engineer , considered a valuable employee by his superiors , but for him existence had not yet tak vanguard of the doomed 11 en on real meaning. she had brought a needed brightness into his surroundings. her soft voice and silvery laughter had been a bridge to a more vivid and interesting world. an immaterial bridge , yet one he might have crossed. he told himself again that he should have asked for her address , should have made an attempt to- see her. certain things she had said indicated that she lived in the same city , or at least sufficiently close to it to do something about meeting her personally."

'' something has happened , brad . . . . `` her words rose in his mind again , and he wondered if the planetoid that had entered the solar system to menace earth had anything to do with the crisis she faced. the celestial hammer , as the weirdly behaved object had come to be called , had brought fear and confusion into millions of lives , and its terrible threat may easily have brought disorder into faye manning's. thousands of persons had already fled the city in the past week. she may have been one of them. but recalling something else she had said , he doubted that. `` this set is going to see a lot of use. ... '' the words held no suggestion of intended flight. they held instead a hint of mystery. what sort of use could she have meant , if not that for which an amateur broadcasting outfit was intended and for which it was licensed ? and if she were using her set for the proper purpose , why was n't it possible for her to keep in touch with him ? slumped in his chair , dunn shook his head wearily. mystery , questions , uncertainty , dread ... . he 'd had enough of that during the past several months. everyone had had enough. first the war , with the slav-asian powers threatening to engulf the world — if atomic weapons did not destroy it first. then the strangely erratic planetoid that had wandered into earth 's path , an even greater threat since it was beyond human control. dunn corrected himself. no , not beyond human control , if a madman named everett stonecrest was to be taken seriously. stonecrest claimed to be able to direct the movements of the planetoid at will. it was he who had dubbed the object the celestial hammer. with an odd clarity , dunn remembered a bible quotation from the man 's first broadcast : `` is not my word as a jire ? saith the lord ; and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces ? '' it had been a clever association of ideas — incredibly clever. few utterances in history had caught more powerfully at human imagination , human beliefs. people were tired , of war"

'' he lighted a cigarette and waited. the slow minutes passed , mockingly soundless. no answer. he sighed finally and crushed out the remains of the cigarette. he rose slowly to his feet. he stood looking down at the radio set for a brooding moment , then reached out to switch it off. '' hello , wf18w ! this is wc33m. am i coming through ? '' the familiar soft voice — but somehow changed. there was an unusual haste in it , a frantic urgency.

'' again her voice had changed. the difference was unmistakable. her words were flat , deliberate — evasive. dunn sat numbly , conscious of a strange new atmosphere , almost as if an invisible menace peered at him out of nothingness. was some other person listening in ? was faye now under a ... a restraint ? he searched carefully for his next words. '' faye , this celestial hammer situation. . . i hope it does n't change things too much for you. you 're not planning to leave , or anything like that ?

'' i 'm looking for the place where everett stonecrest lives , '' dunn said , as he paid for the gas. `` can you tell me how to reach it from here ? '' the attendant 's interest sharpened.

'' dunn nodded his understanding. he had spent the morning looking up information on stonecrest , and the results had been disappointingly meager. among the few facts he had gleaned were that stonecrest was wealthy , past middle age , and lived alone with a handful of servants. he seemed to have no living relatives , no immediate friends. he belonged to no clubs or organizations , never attended social functions of any kind. he was rumored to have a strong interest in science and to maintain a laboratory in his home. there were numerous blank spots in stonecrest 's life that apparently were explained by exploration trips to remote and little-known regions of the earth. tthe attendant went on , '' wish i knew what to make of this celestial hammer deal stonecrest is putting over. most of the people i 've talked to really think he can control the thing. they think he 's a messiah , like they say in the newspapers , that he was given a heavenly power to keep the world from being wiped out by atomic bombs. but me , i do n't know. scientists say the celestial hammer 's a planetoid , something like the moon , only a lot smaller , and made out of common , ordinary rock , just like we got here on earth. sure , there"

'' another reporter , huh ? '' one of vanguard of the doomed 19 the hard-featured men said. he glanced sidewise at his companion and grinned without mirth. `` the way these guys keep popping up , eh , harry ? `` '' you said it , '' harry returned. he shook his head grimly at dunn. `` no luck , mac. nice idea you and the rest of these boys had , but nobody gets in this way. i been trying to sell them the fact. they wo n't buy.

'' look , mac. we get our orders from the house. you call up there and tell them what you want. mr. stonecrest says to pass you in , then we pass you in. okay ? '' dunn shook his head. `` it would take too long to get him on the phone — if i could get him , to start with. i 've got to see miss manning as soon as possible. tell mr. stonecrest that. tell him if i ca n't talk to her , i 'll talk to these reporters. '' scowling at dunn , harry chewed at his lip and ran a palm along the side of his leg. a dim fury seemed to struggle in his eyes. `` all right , '' he said finally. `` all right , mac. '' he whirled to the gate , fumbled a key into the lock and swung one of the two gate sections open. then he glanced back '' '' at the avid faces of the reporters. `` come on , '' he said to dunn. `` you go with me. if mr. stonecrest says to give you the heaveho , i 'll have plenty of room to do it in. '' he stood with angry watchfulness in the gate opening , allowing dunn barely enough room to brush past. 20 then he pushed the gale shut and swiftly set off down a gravel driveway that ran past the greenhouse and the garage beyond it. dunn followed , lengthening his strides to keep up. abreast of the garage , harry darted a look back and then turned sharply toward the concrete strip that ran along the front of the wide structure. he came to a sudden stop as dunn , puzzled by the maneuver , turned after him. the garage was set back a few yards from the driveway. on one side the greenhouse cut off the view of those at the gate , and on the other a building beyond the garage partly blocked off the main house. no other persons were present. this part of the estate was screened and private , and awareness of that fact brought a cold alertness to dunn. harry 's hand came up from behind his back , holding a snub-nosed revolver. his lips were thinned against his teeth.

'' harry 's eyes seemed to retreat in baffled thought. then his face became bleakly set. `` i can still fade you , mac , '' he said softly. as he spoke he moved. he lunged at dunn. the revolver rose club-like in his hand , swept viciously down. dunn had been poised for action , muscles bunched and quivering , like a runner awaiting the starting gun. he moved explosively. he ducked under the blow , swung his body directly into harry 's path. the other 's momentum sent both men sprawling to the concrete strip. dunn heaved and twisted free. as he came erect he saw harry , on hands and knees , reaching for the fallen revolver. he lashed out with a foot , sent the gun skittering across the concrete and into the grass beyond. snarling , harry shot to his feet and drove in at dunn with a barrage of wide-swinging punches. a fist glanced off the side of his head , brought a ringing giddiness. another blow caught him solidly in the chest , drove the wind out of him and sent him staggering back against the front of the garage. harry closed in , eager to finish off his victim. he was a big man , heavyfleshed , whose muscular face showed the scars of past encounters. dunn was the taller of the two , but younger and lighter. harry evidently felt that his weight and experience gave him an overwhelming advantage. he pressed that advantage with reckless confidence. dunn felt the garage against his back as harry 's bulk loomed up before him. desperate awareness of his danger cleared his head. bracing himself , he kicked out with his foot. it was no time for sporting ethics. crippling brutality was harry 's own clearly evident purpose. harry gasped and bent almost double , pain wiping the eagerness from his heavy features. dunn pushed away from the garage , swung his fist in a chopping blow to the side of harry 's face. he followed through with an uppercut that ba ! f straightened the man , and then , as harry vanguard of the doomed 21 seemed momentarily to hang in the air , knees sagging and features blank , dunn threw his sunday punch. harry went down like a bag of wet sand , lay without moving. ry'-w '' glanced around quickly , breathing hard. there were no figures in sight , no sounds of alarm. the swift and"

''how did you get here ? '' he demanded after a moment. the question seemed the most immediate and important thing in his mind. '' harry let me in , '' dunn said , `` at the rear gate. '' '' harry let you in , '' the stocky man echoed , spacing the words. he peered past dunn , as though seeking harry. his eyes were bleak. `` this. . .well , this is irregular , '' he said , evidently explaining his pause. `` just who are you ? what do you want ? '' '' my name 's bradley dunn. i 'm a friend of faye manning , and i 'd like to see her. i 've been worried that she might not be well. '' '' and harry let you in on the strength of that ? '' dunn shrugged. `` i happened to mention that if i did n't get to talk to miss manning i 'd talk to the reporters at the gate. they seemed very interested in anything i could tell them.

'' mr. dunn , i can understand that you should be worried about miss manning. all of us here have been caught up in events , and as a result we 've lost touch with families and friends. naturally that would lead to concern about us. but we 're all safe and sound— miss manning included. it 's just that"

'' '' miss manning , '' he went on in his confiding tone , `` has her own job to do. as mr. stonecrest 's secretary , she 's had to handle thousands of letters that have poured in here. frankly , i do n't think she 'd want to have her work interrupted and lose the time it would take to assure you she was quite all right. '' do n't misunderstand me , mr. dunn. we have n't become anti-social , or anything of the sort. we 're just a dedicated group of people. a tremendous thing has happened — a thing that can change the world. we consider this thing more important than ourselves , more important than our own personal affairs.

'' '' i could tell them there was something very funny going on , here. '' '' such as what ?

'' faye manning is the only one who comes in here , '' he told giliis. '' send away whoever happens to be with her.

'' '' yours could happen a lot faster than mine , '' dunn said. `` do n't forget that. '' slow minutes passed. the occasional shrilling of car horns drifted in faintly from the highway outside. there were other vague sounds that might have come from within the house itself. dunn ached for a cigarette , not daring to relax his vigil long enough to light one. giliis shifted impatiently , frowning. excitement stirred in dunn as he waited. for weeks faye manning had been nothing more than a voice from a short-wave radio loudspeaker. a soft voice that had drawn him , haunted him. but very soon , now , he would see her. in the flesh. what would she be like ? and— his wonder sharpened — what would she think of him ? pootsteps rose into audibility behind the door. dunn stiffened and shot a warning glance at giliis. then the panel moved , its edge swinging toward dunn. a man 's voice said , `` here she is , mr. giliis. '' the stocky man nodded. `` come in , miss manning. . . . you can go back , marty.

'' '' i think he suspects it. that 's why he was keeping itie prisoner. '' '' how did you get on to him ? '' '' i went into the library one afternoon , to look up some records , '' faye began. `` i usually did my work in another part of the house , and i do n't think borzeny expected me there. anyway , i noticed that a panel in the wall was open , and there was a safe behind it , open , too.

'' borzeny — or stonecrest , as i thought of him at the time — explained the situation by saying he was engaged in certain important and confidential work for the government. it seemed logical enough. borzeny can be very charming and persuasive when he wants to be. and besides , i knew he had a laboratory in the house and spent a lot of time there on experi ments of some sort. he even had two assistants helping him. neither of whom could speak english very well. he said they were european specialists , loaned to him lay the government.

'' '' i share the same sentiments where a girl named faye manning is concerned , '' dunn said. `` but where did you get the set you were using ? '' '' there was a powerful model of standard design in a small studio adjoining the laboratory. all of the real stonecrest 's experiments seem to have been with short-wave radio apparatus of new and highly advanced design , but apparently he had one set that he could use for ordinary broadcasting. he had a special room for it , too. this room opened out on a narrow side hall , and i could reach it without being seen. i knew i would n't have been permitted so near to the laboratory. hardly anyone was. borzeny and his assistants kept the laboratory locked when they were n't there , and i was careful to use the radio only when they were in some other part of the house. '' faye paused , and then went on , '' my father was a radio ham , and he taught me how to twiddle the right dials. i was lonesome here , at the house , wanted someone to talk to. borzeny always tried to discourage me from going out in the evenings — for security reasons , he said. and the few times i did go out , he had me followed. i learned about that quickly vanguard of the doomed 29 enough. it was one of the things that convinced me something strange was going on. '' the secret experiments seemed only part of whatever this was. there was something odd about stonecrest himself — or borzeny , that is. he avoided meeting people and carried on most of his affairs by correspondence. he refused to see unexpected visitors , appeared suspicious of almost everyone around him. he did n't hire me to work for him until he had investigated every detail of my background. practically all of his employees seemed to be new. i learned a short tune later that he had fired all the old servants who had worked at the house. '' '' caye changed position on the floor , her soft voice quickening. '' the arrival of this object an the sky that borzeny calls the celestial hammer seemed to bring matters to a head. there was suddenly a lot of excitement. the guards at the estate were doubled — not ordinary guards , either , but professional toughs. from the scraps of information i was able to pick up , it seemed clear that borzeny and his assistants had found they could control the object. what they used , of course , was the special shortwave apparatus with which they had been experimenting , , in the laboratory.

'' dunn said. `` i 'd been wondering how control was possible. '' faye nooded. `` this special apparatus evidently had been built by the real stonecrest. the basic idea , i think , was a completely new type fif radio communication. but borzeny found he was getting signals with itsignals that came from the celestial hammer. no ordinary set could have picked them up. and when borzeny signalled back , the celestial hammer responded by moving toward earth. further experiment showed that a great deal of control was possible. borzeny could have sent the object back into space if he had wanted to. there was no actual intelligence directing the object itself. it was like . . .well , it was like a huge machine. '' '' there are theories that the planetoid is a space ship , '' dunn put in. '' suppose it is. a space ship with a stone hull would he practical enough , where meteors are considered. i do n't know about the passengers. they might all be dead — or in suspended animation , as some persons claim. but suppose that ship were guided in its flight by radio impulses like those sent out by stonecrest 's apparatus. perhaps to keep it from hitting a planet , or falling into a sun. if stonecrest 's set sent out impulses of the same frequency as those sent out by the guiding device , then the ship would follow those impulses. that would explain how control of the planetoid was possible at all. '' he gestured. `` anyway , it 's clear how stonecrest — i mean borzeny — obtained his supernatural abilities. obviously , control of the planetoid gave him the idea of setting himself up as a prophet. '' faye 's blonde head moved , in assent. `` he began using the set over which i talked to you , brad. i could see we would n't be able to keep in touch any more , and i tried to let you know. maybe i was too mysterious. you kept trying to reach me , and borzeny grew excited over it. he said something would have to be done about you. i was afraid you were in real danger , and i warned you as soon as i had a chance to use the set again. borzeny caught me at it. i do n't know what he might have done if we both had n't managed to give him the diea that our talk had been harmless. '' he already was suspicious of me , you see. in fact , i was practically be 30 ing kept a prisoner in the house. i was locked in my room every night. i got out to radio you only because i managed to slip a wad of paper in the door catch. the reason for all this goes back to that open safe in the library.

'' paye shuddered , grimacing. `` i did n't know how close to death i was in those minutes. if borzeny had caught me searching the safe — but he didn't. not actually. i returned things as i had found them and was working on the records i had come to look up , when borzeny returned to the library. he looked at me , and then at the open safe — and from that moment on lie took no chances with me ... . it seems incredible , though , that borzeny could somehow have taken stonecrest 's place. '' '' stonecrest did a lot of traveling to remote corners of the earth , '' dunn said slowly. `` somewhere along the line he and borzeny ran into each other. borzeny was a hunted man , and perhaps some actual physical resemblance between stonecrest and himself suggested the switch in identities. it 's a matter of record that borzeny spoke excellent english , and in addition he was an enormously clever and resourceful man. he had to be , to have escaped capture as long as he did. with a few changes in stonecrest 's papers and identification , with a bit of careful forgery here and there , it would n't have been impossible for him to pass himself off as stonecrest ... . as for stonecrest himself , there 's no doubt but that he 's dead — murdered by borzeny. '' '' and it looks very much as if the same thing is going to happen to us , '' faye whispered , her face gray and drawn. dunn placed a comforting arm about her shoulders. `` not if we play our cards right. the main thing to do is to keep borzeny from finding out how much we know. we 've got to convince him that neither of us has found out about his real identity and connections. especially you , faye. as for me , i 'm just a dumb guy who thought your rich boss was keeping you incommunicado for romantic reasons. and i was just jealous enough to use a gun in trying to pry you loose.

'' the earthl '' it was a sharp ejaculation escaping from his lips. he stared at the ascending lesser moon , the larger one on the opposite horizon , the sun that was much too small in a sky that was much too black , and slowly shook his head. it was not the earth. a puzzled frown creased his forehead. what was the earth ? this was n't the earth , whatever it was. but what was the earth ? the word had risen from some depth of memory without its associations. '' let 's see , '' he said aloud. `` the earth has a larger sun. does it have any moons ? '' he searched his thoughts without finding a definite answer. he gave up the problem of the sky and the earth and turned his attention back to his immediate surroundings. his eyes caught the flash of something bright in a thicket of neatly trimmed shrubs. he went over to it and dragged it out. it was a suit. an emergency suit of the type worn for dropping to a planet from above its atmosphere. not a space suit designed for working in a vacuum. '' what 's it doing here , i wonder ? '' he thought. he examined it curiously. its bulky legs were zippered together. they could be unzippered for walking , but even then it would be clumsy work. attached to the shoulders was a harness with fine strands of cord running to a bulky pile of cloth. a parachute. '' could i have worn it ? '' he asked , and in asking the question he suddenly realized consciously what had been troubling him. `` i ca n't remem ber ! '' he whispered , surprised and troubled. `` let 's see. what can i remember ?

'' all my clothes are new ! '' he whispered. he turned his attention to the emergency suit. it should have markings of some kind on it. perhaps a number. finally he sat down on the blue lawn and gave up. there was nothing — except a vague feeling that the style of the clothing he wore was strange and subtly different from any he had ever worn before. '' so , '' he said tonelessly. `` i ca n't remember my name or where i 'm from — except that it 's a planet called earth. and i 'm not there , whatever this planet is. '' a vague uneasiness began to make itself felt within him. an urge grew to put a lot of distance between him and this spot with its neatly cropped lawn and trimmed shrubs. and the emergency suit. he looked at the thing of plastic and glassite , feeling the growth of the urge to get far away from it. '' but it 's the only thing linking with the past that i have ! '' he protested. from the depths of lost memory the man who forgot 39 rose a feeling of panic. a premonition of danger connected with the suit. he drew back from it , still reluctant to leave it. abruptly it burst into flame. the flames were blinding , the heat they threw off intense even at ten feet. there was no smoke , and shortly there was no flame. only a scorched area of ground and some charred brush that had n't quite burned away. tij_j£llo , '' a cultured female voice sounded at his back. he started slightly , his shoulders stiffening. then he turned casually. '' hello , '' he said mildly. the girl was dressed in the same type of loose-fitting shirt and trousers that he himself wore. her well-proportioned breasts and smoothly rounded hips utterly destroyed the effect of masculinity of her attire , however. as his eyes came to rest on her face the word `` beautiful '' rose into his thoughts. but there was more than beauty. good nature sparkled from her eyes and lurked in the corners of her lips. her skin was a soft tan in color. her hair , glistening brown , fell in disorder as though recently tossed about in the wind.

'' that is , '' he covered up , `` i 've already examined my scalp. there 's no injury of any kind. nothing a doctor could do.

'' glad to meet you , rand/ ' karn said. but his eyes as they surveyed him did n't match the warmth of his randolph beecher , he thought. it was as good a name as any. but why had clara given him a name rather than telling karn the truth ? and there had been a flash of dislike in her first glance at karn. '' rand dropped out at my invitation , '' clara was saying. `` i have n't said anything about it because i — -well , frankly i did n't think he would accept. he 's a pretty busy man most of the time and ca n't take a couple of weeks off like this as a rule. '' '' busy , huh ... '' karn said. `` at what ? '' '' oh , '' clara laughed lightly , `` at things that would bore you to tears. he 's a specialist. the history of chess. he 's writing a book on it. '' 40 '' chess !

'' '' he 's from kem juncture , '' clara said hastily. `` and you should see his library ! would you believe it ? he has over forty thousand books on chess alone , some of them dating back to the twentieth century ! '' '' any good books ? '' karn said. with that parting thrust he turned and strode away. rand watched him go , hesitating to face clara. he felt her hand steal into his. suddenly he was acutely aware of her presence , the magnetic attraction of her. '' why did you do it ? '' he asked , turning his head and looking down at her. '' when you get better acquainted with karn you 'll know , '' clara said. '' he does n't know that i know it , but he 's a muspo , '' '' muspo ? '' rand echoed. '' martian union police officer. secret police , '' she said , linking her arm in his. `` let 's go to the house.

'' randolph beecher , '' he whispered. '' it is n't my name , i 'm quite sure. but already i 'm thinking of myself as rand.

'' welcome to the house of valkor , '' hans had said warmly. rand had instinctively liked clara 's father. he was tall and sturdy , in his late fifties with thinning gray hair and a ruddy complexion. a man who had lived well and made living an art. but rand had sensed an undercurrent of something in hans. he tried to analyze it now as he dressed. was it fear ? it seemed partly that , but more wariness than fear. that was it. hans was like a man on a battle front , suspecting him yet accepting him. ready to shake hands or fight for his life. and the others. they had been cordial but too quiet. reserved as though saying anything might mean trouble. rand shrugged off his feeling of insecurity and"

'' so this is mars , '' he muttered thoughtfully. `` i have no memory of the man who forgot 41 mars. all my memories and feeling seem to be of the earth. i must have come here in that emergency suit , dropped from a ship out in space. '' why did n't i tell clara of that ? kem juncture ! i 'll have to find the library and learn a little about mars and kem juncture so i 'll be able to carry this off without giving myself away.

'' after you 've relaxed you wo n't , darling. and after you 've been here for two weeks you 'll forget all about your musty old chess books.

'' t^arn was alone in the breakfast room , eating a baked mushroom stuffed with deviled egg. he studied rand with frank curiosity as he entered. '' how 's the chess player after a night 's sleep in the country ? '' he asked dryly. '' never better , kara , '' rand said with an attempt at friendliness. '' oh ! a chess player ? '' a new voice exclaimed. it 's owner , a gaunt woman with boney shoulders and wrinkled face , stood in the doorway eyeing rand possessively. '' on vacation , '' clara said warningry. `` i made him promise he would neither talk nor play chess while he 's here. '' '' but you ca n't do that !

'' aunt bessie wo n't rest now until you do. you did n't meet aunt bessie last night ? she was in her room all evening , i think. '' '' perhaps later , '' rand said uncomfortably. `` pleased to meet you , aunt bessie. '' he smiled at her. there 42 seemed to be a faint disappointment in her expression at his sudden surrender. he turned to the table loaded with food. clara was filling two plates. rand studied the food in the hopes of finding something familiar. odors from the steaming food taken out of steam trays were familiar , but they held no associations. simple recognition was all they evoked. he took the two plates and held them while clara continued filling them. then he followed her over to a secluded nook overlooking a picturesque section of garden beyond a narrow window. with the first bite he found that he was very hungry. he decided that although he could n't remember his last breakfast or any other breakfast before that , that it must undoubtedly be the finest one he had ever had. '' it 's part of dad 's way of life. '' clara said. `` johnson , the cook , used to be chef at one of the most famous restaurants of all mars. dad had to buy the restaurant to get his contract and order him out here.

'' '' naturally , '' clara said , stretching out lazily on her side and cupping her head in her arm. she regarded him with a smile , then became serious. '' first , do you remember anything yet ? anything at all ?

'' '' did you know that mars is planning on seceding from the interplanetary government ? '' clara asked abruptly. '' i not only did n't know it , '' rand said , `` but i did n't know there was a planetary government. what 's that got to do with my loss of memory ? you ask as though that had some bearing on it.

'' one of karn 's friends , '' she answered. `` the house is always so filled with guests. karn always has a couple. dad has loads of them , mostly loyalists. he does n't know that karn is against him. karn 's too clever to let him catch on. he always agrees with dad when political matters are discussed.

'' see you when you get back , rand , '' clara said with a smile. she turned abruptly and went to the stairway leading to the second floor. rand followed karn outside and discovered that a car had drawn up in front. the man behind the wheel was the one who had been spying on him and clara with the binoculars. he wanted to draw back , make some excuse not to go. but karn 's hand was on his arm. the car door was open. he stooped down and entered. a second later the car was in motion. karn sat beside him , his eyes studying him frankly , a smile playing at the corners of his mouth. '' what do you think of the interplanetary situation , rand ? '' he asked abruptly. rand shrugged. `` i do n't think anything about it , '' he said carelessly. '' not interested , to"

'' '' about as interested as i am in chess ? '' karn said. '' that 's right , '' rand said. '' i might fool you , '' karn said quietly. `` maybe i know a lot about chess. '' rand swallowed loudly. he wondered why he should be so tense. `` interesting if true , '' he said , looking out the windows at the rolling landscape beside the highway. '' enough , '' karn said quietly , `` so that i believe you are the man i 've been requisitioned to find. '' rand said nothing. by great effort he was keeping his trembling from showing. he studied his reactions with 44 intense interest. he was beginning to sense that deep in his subconscious was something cut off from conscious contact that was listening and knowing and perhaps planning. `` the real me , '' be decided. karn 's chuckle interrupted his thoughts. `` still my move , eh ? '' he said. `` well , here we are. '' the car pulled smoothly to a stop under the marquee of a restaurant. kara got out and held the door open. rand thought of escape. he looked around. there was no place to run to , and even if he managed to escape he would n't know where to go. he got out of the car , and suddenly he was wondering at his calm. did it rise from subconscious knowledge ? or was it merely the product of a fatalism that conditioned him to accept what he could n't avoid ? karn 's must know that he was unable to remember his past life , that he was n't the chess historian clara had claimed , and that he had come from the earth , the mother planet that mars and karn was planning war against. the chauffeur in the front seat had probably read his lips and gotten the whole story. maybe karn had checked and found his identity as randolph beech er was fictitious. it would be a simple enough matter for the m.u.s.p. to check on that. and the reason karn was n't pointing a gun at him to prevent him from escaping must be that he knew there was no place to escape to. so he preceded karn into the restaurant calmly as though he were unaware that he was a prisoner about to be taken to whatever prison lay hidden in this place. '' right on through to that door at the back , '' karn said. rand nodded , eyeing the few customers sitting at the tables with blank expression. at the door karn had pointed out be paused while karn rapped three short knocks , paused , and repeated them. the door opened revealing a narrow hallway. through one door came kitchen sounds. they passed several other doors.

'' he stepped past rand now and went to a door , opening it. '' after you , rand , '' he said. the room rand stepped into was a small office. there were four desks crowded into it , and on each desk were several phones. '' a bookie joint , '' karn grinned. `` a real one. that 's how we finance our operations , and it also gives us a ready made network of private wires for our real work. '' '' i do n't get it , '' rand said. '' you will , '' karn said. `` i want you to meet aaron vorik , our leader. aaron , this is the man i called you about. '' '' oh , yesl '' the short , dark-haired man said , rising. he extended a hand in a hawk-like motion. rand accepted it , his thoughts mystified by the apparently warm reception. he had expected to be arrested. '' sit down , rand , '' kara said. aaron will explain to you what we have in mind. '' rand took a seat slowly , studying aaron vorik. a product of the universal melting pot , he had the nonracialness that characterizes those whose veins carry the blood of all races equally mixed. his eyes were black and extremely intelligent , his mouth large and flexible. '' it 's very simple , '' aaron said. `` we want you to plan all the tactical details of our war of secession from earth , '' the man who forgot touring the long moment of absolute silence that followed , rand was aware of two things. the eager , intent expressions on karia 's and aaron 's faces , and the surge of elation that rose in his mind like a flood , filling his consciousness so intensely that he felt it must show on his face. then , as though it were some other person across the room , he heard himself saying calmly , with a mixture of caution and modesty , `` but i 'm not qualified for such a task. chess is basically similar to war and politics , but it does n't qualify a man to deal with the intricacies of actual politics and war. anyway , how do you know my sympathies are for the secessionists ? they might be for the loyalists !

'' '' you say you 've heard of me ? '' rand asked cautiously. '' better than that , '' arron said. he pulled open a drawer and brought out a book , tossing it with careless good humor toward rand. rand caught it. the name under the title caught his startled eye. it was randolph beecher. and the title was `` chess logistics. '' '' i 've read it — since yesterday , '' aaron said. `` with it i could almost do the planning myself , but why should i when we can have the master himself work on the problems involved ? '' rand only half heard. he was staring at the book in fascination. he knew every word in the book. he closed his eyes. `` on page fifty-six , '' he thought wonderingly , '' there is a typographical error in the third line. '' idiy he opened the book to that page. the error was there ! '' / must be randolph beecher '' he thought. he searched his mind for some verification , some clue that could make him sure. there was nothing except a faint whisper that he was not. '' all right , '' he heard himself say. it startled him. he opened his mouth to deny his own words , then closed it. '' fine. fine , '' aaron vorik exclaimed , jumping up and coming around his desk to shake hands with rand enthusiastically. `` go out and order drinks sent in , '' he said to karn. '' this calls for a celebration. '' while karn was gone aaron varik went to a desk and took out a metal box. when he opened it rand saw that it was filled with currency. '' take a handful , '' aaron said. '' from now on you do n't need to worry about money. spend a thousand a day if you want. salt some away , just in case , if you wish. i 'm doing that myself. here. '' he took out a thick pile of bills and thrust them into rand 's hands. karn returned in time to see rand putting the money in his pockets , and nodded knowingly. he was carrying a tray with three sparkling drinks. rand accepted one. '' here 's to success , '' aaron said. rand sampled the drink cautiously. it was a strange flavor. he asked no questions. '' one thing , '' aaron said , smacking his lips over the drink , `` you wiil go on as you have been doing , to all appearances. continue your vacation 46 visit at the house of valkor. karn will see to it that you have your own car. you can remain oblivious of the intrigue going on around you there. that"

'' rand nodded , turning the cold glass in his hands absently. '' we 'd better go now , '' karn said , finishing his drink. flara was nowhere around when they reached the house , karn muttered something about having to see somebody. this suited rand. he hurried to his room , grateful 'for the chance to do some serious thinking before he would have to see clara. the biggest mystery , he knew , far outweighing the utterly mad offer of aaron varik for him to mastermind the martian rebellion against the earth , was how clara had picked the name randolph beecher for him. up until aaron had said that he had heard of beecher he had assumed that it had just been a name that popped into her mind on the spur of the moment. even then he had decided the name must have come from chance memory. the fact that beecher actually was a chess expert only added to that belief. but when he had taken the book on chess and realized that he knew it far better than any casual reading in the past that was lost to conscious memory could account for , he had also realized that clara 's picking of that name could n't be chance. so chance was ruled out. '' that leaves— design , '' rand muttered. `` but , in that case , my landing at this place after dropping from a ship in outer space would also have to be design. possible. my trajectory could have been calculated with fair accuracy. '' he studied the possibilities this gave rise to. clara and her father seemed to be fairly important people to rate such a huge estate. rich , to be able to buy a large and famous restaurant just to get its chef. '' suppose , '' he thought , `` just suppose i 'm an earth agent sent here for some reason. i could n't act alone. i would have to have contacts , an identity , a place to stay. my contacts would get word i was coming , and when i would get here. one of them , clara , would be on the watch for me. '' that makes sense. but then something happened that caused me to lose my memory. maybe i fell too fast. maybe i landed wrong and blanked out , my instincts getting me out of the emergency suit before its chemicals reacted with the atmosphere and made it burn. or before the time fire-bomb that might have been in it to destroy it went off.

'' he snapped his fingers in excitement at a sudden thought. '' there 's her letting me go for a ride alone with her brother 1 `` he thought. `` she would n't have done that unless — `` the thought staggered him. '' unless she knew that there was something in my subconscious that would take care of the situation. that aaron varik would accept me. that the man who forgot 47 would mean — hypnotism. in some way by hypnosis my true identity and past memories have been blocked off by hypnosis ! why ? there could be only one reason. i must be a tactician —qualified to do the job aaron and karn want me to do , with knowledge of the forces and deployment of the earth 's space navy. if mars ever found that out they would have ways of forcing me to talk. so if hypnosis could place all that knowledge beyond my conscious reach no amount of torture or truth drugs could get it out of me. '' he thought this over , nodding with quiet satisfaction. '' that must be it , '' he decided. '' and i can see what my objective would be. it would be to maneuver martian ships into traps that my subconscious knows to exist , so that earth could win. '' the complexity and diabolical cunning of the plot held him breathless. earth sending her own key man to direct martian war activities so that earth could win i and that man was he ! a confidence took hold of him. at the right times his subconscious would provide the knowledge he needed. behind the hypnotically induced curtain of his mind his true self was working in full consciousness. with a queer loneliness he reached toward that hidden self , wondering who it might be , who he really was. and in answer came a faint whisper of thought that he could never know until his task was done. until then he must remain— randolph beecher , the martian. ttiere was a discreet knock at the door. when rand called , '' come in , '' a servant entered , carrying neatly pressed formal garb. '' your clothing just arrived , sir , '' he said deferentially. `` since there is to be quite a party this evening , mr , valkor suggested i get your dinner clothes ready for you. dinner is in half an hour.

'' she glanced significantly toward the picture behind which the microphone was concealed. rand grinned. `` you 're a honey , '' he said. `` how about a kiss ? '' clara wrinkled her nose at him , but she went obediently into his arms. '' anything exciting happen with karn ? `` she whispered , her lips against his ear. '' plenty , '' rand whispered. `` there 's something i want to know. who am i ? '' he felt her body stiffen against him , then slowly relax. '' i do n't know , '' she answered. `` ah i know is that— if you are suspected of being an earth spy you will be killed. i do n't want that to happen. '' '' but you knew i was coming , '' rand whispered. '' no , '' clara said. `` i didn't. '' '' you must have , '' rand whispered. '' otherwise how would you pick the name randolph beecher for me — the name i 'm obviously supposed to masquerade under ? '' '' i met randolph once , '' clara said. '' you look very much like him. enough to be him. '' '' is that the truth ? '' rand asked. '' yes , '' clara whispered. rand took her head in his hands 48 and held her face away , studying her intently. he could see nothing but sincerity in her eyes. '' what 's the matter ? '' she asked timidly. '' nothing , '' rand said , `` except that a beautiful theory goes out the window and i do n't know any mare about myself than i did before. '' he released her. '' let 's go downstairs , '' he said gruffly. '' we 'll have time for a short walk before the guests arrive , '' clara said. a moment later they were walking across a broad expanse of lawn. '' now , '' clara said. `` what 's this beautiful theory you had ? '' '' everything seemed to point toward it , '' rand said. `` it made me an earth spy with my identity and my past , and almost everything else blocked off from consciousness by hypnosis. you had to be my contact that was to give me an identity and get me started.

'' '' what do you think 's back of it ? '' clara asked. '' things seem to indicate , '' he said , '' that i 'm here to take charge of masterminding the martian plot for secession , and that my purpose is to so mastermind it that earth forces will defeat the martians. in other words , from behind the hypnotic curtain of my mind is supposed to come details and plans that will seem to ensure the martians of winning , but which will ensure their being defeated. '' '' what makes you think that ? '' clara asked , staring at him with wonder. '' karn took me to meet aaron varik , '' rand said. `` i 've been chosen — as randolph beecher the master chess player — to mastermind the martian plans. '' '' no ! '' clara exclaimed unbelievingly. `` but if that 's true , have you thought to wonder why they would give a total stranger a job like that ? after all , would n't they have a military staff trained for a thing like that ? '' . `` they undoubtedly have , '' rand said. `` they told me they felt that my very lack of experience with those things would give me a better slant — enable me as a chess genius to make planned maneuvers that would be superior to those a military staff could work out.

'' then , through you , '' she said , '' they could find out what earth would want them to do to be defeated. they could find out through you just what they must avoid. instead of the man who forgot 49 following your plans those plans would serve as the danger map in their operations !

'' clara ! '' he said urgently , shaking her head. she moaned drowsily. he shook her again. then he went to the bathroom and soaked a washcloth in cold water , coming back with it and bathing her face. she opened her eyes , then closed them.

'' there was something ... i found out something. oh yes. karn just got word last night that the m.u. s.p. through their agents on earth have found out your true identity and the key to wiping out your hypnotic bloc. they do n't intend to do that until they 've let you map the strategy they 've assigned you to map for them. once you 've done that they 'll drug you and unlock the , secret plans hidden there. they 're sure that by doing that they can uncover top secret earth plans and use that knowledge to win the war that 's coming.

'' he was ignoring the snub-nosed gun pointed at him. '' you 've gone too far , rand , '' karn said in a tired voice. '' too far ? '' rand said , giving a short bitter laugh. `` you mean knocking out your friend ? how could i do that ? you said he had already gone ? '' '' too far , rand , '' karn said , his voice a monotone.

'' rand hoped that this sudden shift in the direction of the argument would take karn slightly off guard. as he spoke he threw the wet washcloth at him and propelled himself forward in a long low diving tackle. he saw karn avoid the washcloth and his outstretched arms. he was sprawling on the floor , realizing he had lost his gamble , when he felt a stinging pain where his neck joined his shoulder. karn had used the gun to paralyze his arm. '' it was a nice try , rand , '' karn said. `` now get up. we 're leaving. '' rand got slowly to his feet. his arm bung uselessly at his side. '' so you do n't want to kill me here , '' he said.

'' and suddenly he did n't want to know who he was. using his elbow clumsily to open the car door he climbed out and followed her into the house. inside was a comfortable living room. no one was there. his shoulder and hand were throbbing. he felt weak , and suddenly he felt nauseated. he sank into a chair and leaned back , closing his eyes. dr. temple turned away from the phone. `` that takes care of the car and karn 's body , '' he said gravely. `` it 's the only way.

'' why do n't you sit down , rand ? '' dr. temple said abruptly. `` try to relax. my friend at kern juncture has undoubtedly received my letter by now and taken it to the earth embassy. it should n't be long until 58 we get a reply and know what to do.

'' there was nothing they would not do for a pinch of sugar. gold , platinum and diamonds , nar- cotics by the acre — these were to be had in generous exchange for sugar — which was selling on earth at a nickel or so a pound wholesale. the space ship went into shut- tle service. a load of diamonds and dope coming back , a load of sugar and blondes going up. blondes made martians higher even than sugar , and brought larger and quicker returns. this is a confidential tip to the south african diamond trust : ten space ship loads of precious stones are now being cut in a cellar on bleecker street in new york. the mob plans to retail them for $ 25 a carat ! though the gangsters are buy- ing sugar at a few cents a pound here and selling it for its weight in rubies on mars , a hood is al- ways a hood. they 've been cut- ting dope with sugar for years on earth , so they did n't know how to do it any different on mars. what to cut the sugar with on mars ? simple. with heroin , of course , which is worthless there. this is a brief rundown on the racket situation as it currently exists on our sister planet. faked passports : when the boys first landed they found only vague boundaries between the nations , and martians could roam as they pleased. maybe this is why they stayed close to home. though anyway why should they travel ? there was nothing to see. the boys quickly took"

'' after some discussion they cut cards. one of the bergen county boys drew the black ace. `` what do i know about being a cop ? '' he squawked. ' ' you ca n ta ke graft , ca n ' t you ? you been shook down , ai n't you ? '' the boys also imported a cou- ple of smart mouthpieces and a ship of blank habeas corpus tortus , together with a judge who was the brother of one of the lawyers , so there was no need to build a jail in this model city. the only ones who ever get arrested , anyway , are the mar- tians , and they soon discovered that the coppers from terra would look the other way for a bucket full of gold. until the arrival of the earth- men , the martians were , as stated , peaceful , and even now crime is practically unknown among them , the chief problem , however , is to keep them in line on pay nights , when they go on sugar binges. chocolate bars are as common on mars as saloons are on broad- way , and it is not unusual to see '' gone '' martians getting heaved out"

'' comes the revolution , they were told , and all martians could remain bachelors. it is no wonder the communists made such in- roads. the planet became known as `` the red planet. '' in their confidential books about the cities of earth , lait and mor- timer explored the community of interest between the organized underworld and the soviet. communists are in favor of anything that causes civil disorder and unrest ; gangsters have no conscience and will do business with anyone who pays. on earth , russia floods the western powers , and especially the united states , with narcotics , first to weaken them and provide easy prey , and second , for dollar exchange. and on earth , the mafia , which is another international conspir- acy like the communists , sells the narcotics. mars confidential 15 and so when the gangsters heard there were communist cells on mars , they quickly made a contact. for most of the world 's cheap sugar comes from russia ! the mafia inroad on the american sugar market had already driven cane up more than 300 per cent. but the russians were anxious , able and willing to provide all the beets they wanted at half the com- petitive price. vi the honest hoods ■ as we pointed out in previous works , the crime syndicate now owns so much money , its chief problem is to find ways in which to invest it. as a result , the mafia and its allies control thousands of legiti- mate enterprises ranging from ho- tel chains to railroads and from laundries"

'' '' a big fat hole in the head. '' '' cut it out. this is serious. '' '' a hole in the head ai n't seri- ous ? '' '' there 's no profit in them one- shot deals.

'' '' we 're talking about legit stuff. 16 all the rest has been taken rare of. '' ''with the martians i 've seen , a bar of soap could be a big thing. '' from this random suggestion , there sprang up a major inter- planetary project. if the big soap companies are wondering where all that soap went a few years ago , we can tell them. it went to mars. ' soap caught on immediately. it was snapped up as fast as it ar- rived. but several questions popptid into the minds of the mafia soap salesman. where was it all going ? a martian , in line for a bar in the evening , was back again the fol- lowing morning for another one. and why did the martians stay just as dirty as ever ? the answer was , the martians stayed as dirty as ever because they were n't using the soap to wash with. they were eating it ! 1 1 cured the hangover from sugar. another group cornered the un- dertaking business , adding a twist that made for more activity. they added a department of elimina- tion. the men in charge of this end of the business circulate through the chocolate and soap bars , politely inquiring , `` who would you like killed ? '' struck with the novelty of the thing , quite a few martians re- member other martians they are mad at. the going price is one hundred carats of diamonds to kill ; which is cheap considering the average laborer earns 10,000 carats a week. then the boys from the more dignified end of the business drop tn at the home of the victim and mars confidential 17 offer to bury him cheap. two hun- dred and fifty carats gets a mar- tian planted in style. inasmuch as martians live un- derground , burying is done in reverse , by tying a rocket to the tail of the deceased and shooting him out into the stratosphere. vii one universe confidential mars is presently no problem to earth , and will not be until we have all its gold and the martians begin asking us for loans."

'' you know it 's not that easy , do n't you ? there are lots and lots of pretty girls on earth and very few billionaires. if you did get a job singing in a nightclub , you know you 'd have to do some un- pleasant things because there 's so much competition for customers. things like stripteasing , drinking at the tables and going out with whoever the owner tells you to.

'' dr. kalmar shook his head re- gretfully. he pushed a button on his desk. it was connected to a gravity generator directly under the girl 's chair. four gravities sud- denly pushed her down into it and a hypodermic needle jabbed her swiftly with a hypnotic drug. she slumped. he released the button and the artificial gravity abated , but she remained dazed and re- laxed.

'' somebody will. none of us 'll live that long. '' working like a sculptor with a cathode in one hand and an anode in the other , dr. kalmar began reshaping the_girl who stood fix- edly in the boxlike chamber. the flesh fled from the cathode and chased af ter the anode as he broadened the fine nose , thick- ened the mobile lips , squared the slender jaw and drew out care- fully the delicately arched orbital ridges. '' i 'll leave the curl in her hair , '' he said. `` every woman needs at least one feature she can be proud of. '' no charge fok alterations 45 '' you 're telling me , '' miss du- pont replied. '' synthetic tissue , please.

'' you simply must n't go on ! there 's the very devil of a mess turning up , and you must n't run into it ! '' a girl 's voice answered , also in english. `` i 'm sure — i do n't know what you 're talking about ! `` '' i 'm afraid i ca n't explain. but , truly , you must n't go on to the village ! '' coburn pushed ahead. he came upon the people who had spoken. there was a girl riding on a don- key. she was american. trim. neat. uneasy , but reasonably self-confident. and there was a man standing by the trail , with a slide of earth behind him and mud on his boots as if he 'd slid down somewhere very fast to intercept l his girl. he wore the distinctive costume a brilish correspondent is apt to affect in the wilds. they turned as coburn came into view. the girl goggled at him. he was not exactly the sort of third person one expected to find on a very lonely , ill-defined rocky trail many miles north of salonika. when they turned to him , co- burn recognized the man. he 'd met dillon once or twice in salon- ika. he panted : `` dillon ! there 's a column of soldiers headed across the border ! bulgarians ! '' '' how close ? `` asked dillon. '' they 're coming , '' said co- burn , with some difficulty due to lack of breath. `` i saw them across the valley. everybody 's run away from the village. i was the last one out.

'' just to make sure , '' said co- burn , `` i 'll see if i can get a view back down the trail. '' where the vastness of the sky showed , he might be able to look down. he scrambled up a barrier two man-heights high. there was a screen of straggly brush , with emptiness beyond. he peered. he could see a long way down and behind , and actually the vil- lage was clearly in sight from here. there were rumbling , caterpillar- tread tanks in the act of entering it. there were anachronistic mounted men with them. cavalry is outdated , nowadays , but in rocky mountain country they can have uses where tanks ca n't go. but here tanks and cavalry looked grim. coburn squirmed back and beckoned to the girl. she joined him. they peered through the brushwood together. the light tanks were scurrying along the single village street. horsemen raced here and there. a pig squealed. there was a shot. the tanks emerged from the other side. they went crawling swiftly toward the south. but they did 110 not turn aside where the villagers had. they headed along the way coburn had driven to ardea. infantrymen appeared , march- ing into the village. an advance party , rifles ready. this was strict discipline and standard military practise. horsemen rode to tell them that all was quiet. they turned and spurred away after the tanks. the girl said in a strained voice. '' this is war starting ! invasion ! '' coburn said coldly , `` no. no planes. this is n't war. it 's a train- ing exercise , iron-curtain style. this outfit will strike twenty — maybe thirty miles south. there 's a town there — kilkis. they 'll take it and loot it. by the time athens finds out what 's happened , they 'll be ready to fall back. they 'll do a little fighting. they 'll carry off the people. and they 'll deny everything. the west does n't want war. greece"

'' three or four thousand men , '' said coburn coldly. `` this is a big raid. but it 's not war. not yet. '' it was not the time for full-scale war. bulgaria and the other coun- tries in its satellite status were under orders to put a strain upon the outside world. they were building up border incidents and turmoil for the benefit of their masters. turkey was on a war footing , after a number of inci- dents like this. indo-china was at war. korea was an old story. now greece. it always takes more men to guard against criminal actions than to commit them. when this raid was over greece would have to maintain a full-size army in its northern mountains to guard against its repetition. which would be a strain on its treasury and might help toward bankruptcy. this was cold war. the infantry ended. horse- drawn vehicles appeared in a seemingly endless line. motorized transport would be better , but the bulgarians were short of it. shaggy , stubby animals plodded in the wake of the tanks and the infantry. there were two-wheeled carts in single file all across the valley. they went through the village and filed after the soldiers. '' i think , '' said coburn in bit- ing anger , `` this will be all there is to see. they 'll go in until they 're stopped. they 'll kidnap greek civilians and later work them to death in labor camps. they 'll carry off some children to raise as spies. but their purpose is prob- ably only to make such a threat that the greeks will go broke guarding against them. they know the greeks do n't want war. '' he began to wriggle back from the brushwood screen . he was filled with the sort of sick rage that comes when you ca n't ac- tively resent insolence and arro- gance. he hated the people who wanted the world to collapse , and this was part of their effort to bring it about. he helped the girl down. `` dil- lon said to wait , '' he said. he found himself shaking with anger at the men who had ordered the troops to march. `` he said he was taking pictures. he must have had an advance tip of some sort. if so , he 'll have a line of retreat.

'' he nodded and attacked the cliff , it had n't been a difficult climb for dillon. it was n't even a long one for coburn , but it was much worse than he 'd thought. the crevices for handholds were rare , and footholds were almost non- existent. there were times when he felt he was holding on by his fingernails. dillon seemed to have made it with perfect ease , but coburn found it exhausting. fifty feet up he came to the place where dillon had vanished. but it was a preposterously diffi- cult task to get across an undercut to where he could grasp a stunted tree. it was a strain to scramble up past it. then he found himself on the narrowest of possible ledges , with a sickening drop off to one side. but dillon had made it , so he followed. he went a hundred yards , and then the ledge came to an end. he saw where dillon must have climbed. it was possible , but co- burn violently did not want to try. still ... he started. then something clicked in his throat. there was a rather deep ledge for a space of four or five feet. and there was dillon. no , not dillon. just dillon 's clothes. they lay flat and deflated , but laid out in one assembly beside a starveling twisted bush. it would have been possible for a man to stand there to take off his clothes , if he wanted to. but a man who takes off his clothes — and why should dillon do that ? — takes them off one by one. these gar- ments were fitted together. the coat was over the shirt , and the trousers fitted to the bottom of the shirt over the coat , and the boots were at"

'' he felt a sort of hysterical com- posure. he opened the chest. it was patently artificial. there were such details on the inside as would be imagined in a container needed to fit something snugly. at the edges of the opening there were fastenings like the teeth of a zip- per , but somehow different. co- burn knew that when this was fastened there would be no visi- ble seam. whatever wore this suit-that- looked-like-dillon could feel per- fectly confident of passing for dil- lon , clothed or otherwise. it could pass without any question for — coburn gagged. // could pass without question for a human being. obviously , whatever was wear- ing this foam-rubber replica of dillon was not human ! coburn went back to where he had to climb down the cliffside again. he moved like a sleep- walker. he descended the fifty- foot cliff by the crevices and the single protruding rock-point that had helped him get up. it was much easier going down. in his slate of mind it was also more dangerous. he moved in a sort of robot-like composure. he moved toward the girl , trying to make words come out of his throat , when a small rock came clattering down the cliff."

'' i hoped , '' he said ruefully to janice ames , `` that the bulgars would toddle off. but they left a 114 guard in the village. we ca n't hope to take an easier trail. we 'll have to go back the way you came. we 'll get you safe to sa- lonika , though. '' the girl smiled , uneasily but gratefully. ' 1 and , '' added dillon , 1 ' we 'd better get started. '' he gallantly helped the girl remount her donkey. at the sight , coburn was shaken out of his numbness. he moved fiercely to intervene. but janice settled her- self in the saddle and dillon con- fidently led the way. coburn grimly walked beside her as she rode. he was convinced that he would n't leave her side while dil- lon was around. but even as he knew that desperate certitude , he was filled with confusion and a panicky uncertainty. when they 'd traveled about half a mile , another frightening thought occurred to coburn. per- haps dillon — passing for human — was n't alone. perhaps there were thousands like him. invaders ! usurpers , pretending to be men. invaders , obviously , from space ! ii they made eight miles. at least one mile of that , added together , was climbing straight up. another mile was straight down. the rest was boulder-strewn , twisting , don- key-wide , slanting , slippery stone. but there was no sign of anyone but themselves. the sky remained undisturbed. no planes. they saw no sign of the raiding force from across the border , and they heard no gunfire. coburn struggled against the stark impossibility of what he had seen. the most horrifying concept regarding invasion from space is that of creatures who are able to destroy or subjugate humanity. a part of that concept was in co- burn 's mind now. dillon marched on ahead , in every way convinc- ingly human. but he wasn't. and to coburn , his presence as a non-human invader of earth made the border-crossing by the bulgarians seem almost benevo- lent. they went on. the next hill was long and steep. then they were at the hill crest. they looked down into a village called naousa. it was larger than ardea , but not much larger. one of the houses burned un tended. figures moved about. there were tanks in sight , and many soldiers in the uniform that looked dark-gray at a dis- tance. the route by which dillon had traveled had plainly curved into the"

'' what 's happened ? '' demanded janice uneasily. `` those are sol- diers on the ground. '' coburn 's fright prevented his caution. he shouted furiously. '' he 's not a man ! you saw it ! no man can run so fast ! you saw those jumps ! he 's not human ! he 's — something else ! '' janice jerked her eyes to co- burn in panic. `` what did you say ? '' coburn panted : `` dillon 's no man ! he 's a monster from some- where in space ! and he and his kind have killed those soldiers ! murdered them ! and the soldiers are men ! you stay here. i 'll go down there and — `` '' no ! '' said janice , `` i 'm com- ing too. '' he took the donkey 's halter and led the animal down to the village , with janice trembling a little in the saddle. he talked in a tight , taut , hysterical tone. he told what he 'd found up on the cliffside. he described in detail the similitude of a man 's body he 'd found deflated beside a stunted bush. he did not look at janice as he talked. he moved doggedly to- ward the village , dragging at the donkey 's head. they neared the houses very slowly ,"

'' he was. he was merely a boy. twenty or thereabouts. he lay on his back , his eyes closed. his face was upturned like a dead man's. but his breast rose and fell rhythmically. he slept as if he were drugged. but that was more incredible than if he 'd been dead. regiments of men fallen simultaneously asleep. . . . coburn 's flow of raging speech stopped short. he stared. he saw other fallen soldiers. dozens of them , fn coma-like slumber , the soldiers who had come to loot and murder lay like straws upon the ground , if they had been dead it would have been more believable. at least there are ways to kill men. but this . , . dillon parted the group of vil- lagers about him and came to- ward cob urn and janice. he was frowning in a remarkably human fashion. '' here 's a mess ! '' he said irri- tably. `` those bulgars came marching down out of the pass. the cavalry galloped on ahead and cut the villagers off so they could n't run away. they started to loot the village. they were n't pleasant. women began to scream , and there were shootings — all in a matter of minutes. and then the looters began to act strangely. they staggered around and sat down and went to sleep ! '' he waved his hands in a help- less gesture , but coburn was not deceived. '' the tanks arrived. and they stopped — and their crews went to sleep ! then the infantry ap- peared , staggering as it marched. the officers halted to see what was happening ahead , and the entire infantry dropped off to sleep right where it stood ! '' it 's bad ! if it bad happened a mile or so back . . . the greeks must have played a trick on them , but those cavalrymen raised the devil in the few minutes they were out of hand ! they killed some villagers and then keeled over. and now the villagers are n't pleased. there was one man whose son was murdered , and he 's been slitting the bulgars ' throats ! '' he looked at coburn , and co- burn said in a grating voice : `` i see.

'' '' yes , '' said coburn. `` i 'll do it. i 'll take janice along , too. '' '' splendid ! '' dillon nodded as if in relief. `` she 'd better get out of the mess entirely. i fancy there ' d have been a full-scale massacre if we had n't come along. the greeks have no reason to love these chaps , and their inten- tions were hardly amiable. but one ca n't let them be murdered ! '' coburn had his hand on his re- volver in his pocket. his finger was on the trigger. but if dillon needed him to rim an errand , then there obviously were no others of his own kind about. dillon turned his back. he gave orders in the barbarous dialect of the mountains. his voice was authoritative. men obeyed him and dragged uniformed figures out of a light half-track that was plainly a staff car. dillon beck- oned , and coburn moved toward him. the important thing as far as coburn was concerned was to get janice to safety. then to re- port the full event. '' i ... i 'm not sure . . . '' be- gan janice , her voice shaking. '' i 'll prove what i said , '' raged coburn in a low tone. `` i 'm not crazy , though i feel like it ! '' dillon beckoned again. janice slipped off the donkey 's back. she looked pitifully frightened and irresolute. '' i 've located the chap who 's the mayor of this village , or some- thing like that. take htm along. they might not believe you , but they 'll have to investigate when he turns up. '' a white-bearded villager re- luctantly climbed into the back of the car. dillon pleasantly of- fered to assist janice into the front seat. she climbed in , deathly white , frightened of coburn and almost ashamed to admit that his vehement outburst had made her afraid of dillon , too. dillon came around to coburn 's side of the vehicle. `` privately , '' he said with a confidential air , '' i 'd advise you to dump this may- or person where lie can reach au- thority , and then go away quietly and say nothing of what hap- pened up here. if the greeks are using some contrivance that han- dles an affair like this , it will be top secret. they wo n't like civil- ians knowing about it. '' coburn 's grip on his revolver was savage. it seemed likely , now , that dillon was the only one of his extraordinary kind about. '' i think i know why you say that , '' he said harshly."

'' he protested. `` i 'm quite unoffi- cial ! `` he was incredibly convincing at that moment. there was a wry half-smile on his face. he looked absolutely human ; abso- 118 lutely like the british correspond- ent coburn had met in salonika. he was too convincing. coburn knew he would suspect his own sanity unless he made sure. '' you 're not only unofficial , '' said coburn grimly. his hand came up over the edge of the staff-car door. it had his revolver in it. it bore inexorably upon the very middle of dillon 's body. '' you 're not human , either ! you 're not a man ! your name is n't dillon ! you 're — something i have n't a word for ! but if you try anything fancy i 'll see if a bullet through your middle will stop you ! '' dillon did not move. he said easily : `` you 're being absurd , my dear fellow. put away that pistol. '' '' you slipped ! '' said coburn thickly. `` you said the greeks played a trick on this raiding party. but you played it. at ardea , when you climbed that cliff — no man could climb so fast. no man could run as you ran down into this village. and i saw that body you 're wearing when you were n't in it ! i followed you up the cliff when — `` coburn 's voice was ragingly sarcastic — '' when you were taking pictures ! '' dillon 's face went impassive. then he said : `` well ? '' '' will you let me scratch your finger ?

'' he took a knife from his pocket and snapped it open. he deliber- ately ran the point down the side of one of his fingers. the skin parted. something that looked exactly like foam- the invaders 119 rubber was revealed. there were even bubbles in it. the pseudo-dillon said , `` you see , you do n't have to be afraid of him. he 's sane , and quite hu- man. you 'll feel much better trav- eling with him. '' then the figure turned to coburn. `` you wo n't believe it , but i really like you , coburn. i like the way you 've reacted. it 's very . . . human. '' coburn said to him : `` it 'll be human , too , when we start to hunt you down ! '' he let the staff car in gear. dillon smiled at him. he let in the clutch , and the car leaped ahead. in the two camera-cases coburn was sure that he had the cryptic device that was responsible for the failure of a cold-war raid. he would n't have dared drive away from dillon leaving these devices behind. if they were what he thought , they 'd be absolute proof of the truth of his story , and they should furnish clues to the sort of science the invaders possessed. show the world that invaders were upon it , and all the world would combine to defend earth. the cold war would end. but a bitter doubt came to him. would they ? or would they offer zestfully to be viceroys and over- seers for the invaders , betraying the rest of mankind for the privi- lege of ruling them even under unhuman masters ? janice swayed against his shoul- der. he cast a swift glance at her. her face was like marble. '' what 's the matter ? '' she shook her head. `` i 'm trying not to faint , '' she said unsteadily. '' when you told me be was from another world 1 . . . thought you were crazy. but when he admitted it . . . when he proved it . . . '' coburn growled. the trail twisted and dived down a steep slope. it twisted again and ran across a rushing , frothing stream. coburn drove into the rivulet. water reared up in wing-like sheets on either side. the staff car climbed out , rocking , on the farther side. coburn put it to the ascent beyond. the trail turned and climbed and descended as the stony masses of the hills required. '' he 's — from another world ! `` repeated janice. her teeth chat- tered. `` what do they want"

'' '' this is a pretty good world , '' said coburn fiercely. `` and his kind will want it. we 're merely the natives , the aborigines , to them , maybe they plan to wipe us out , or enslave us. but they wo n't ! we can spot them now ! they do n't bleed. scratch one and you find — foam-rubber. x-rays will spot them. we 'll learn to pick them out — and when some spe- cialists look over those things that look like cameras we 'll know more 120 slill ! enough to do something ! '' '' then you think it 's an inva- sion from space ? '' '' what else ? '' snapped coburn. ii is stomach was a tight cramped knot now. he drove the car hard ! in air miles the distance to be covered was relatively short. in road miles it seemed interminable. the road was bad and curving be- yond belief. it went many miles east and many miles west for every mile of southward gain. the hour grew late. coburn had lied ardea at sunrise , but they 'd reached naousa after midday and he drove frantically over incredi- ble mountain roads until dusk. despite sheer recklessness , how- ever , he could not average thirty miles an hour. there were times when even the half-track had to crawl or it would overturn. the sun set , and he went on up steep grades and down steeper ones in the twilight. night fell and the headlights glared ahead , and the staff-car clanked and clanked and grumbled and roared on through the darkness. they probably passed through villages — the headlights showed stone hovels once or twice — but no lights appeared. it was mid- night before they saw a moving yellow spot of brightness with a glare as of fire upon steam above it. there were other small lights in a row behind it , and they saw that all the tights moved. '' a ra ilroad ! `` said coburn. '' we 're getting somewhere ! '' it was a railroad train on the other side of a valley , but they did not reach the track. the highway curved away from it. at two o'clock in the morning they saw electric lights. the high- way became suddenly passable. presently they ran into the still , silent streets of a slumbering town — serrai — an administra- tive center for this part of greece. they threaded its ways while coburn watched for a proper place to stop. once a curiously- hatted policeman stared blankly at them under an arc lamp as the staff car clanked and rumbled past him. they saw a great pile of stone which was a church. they saw a railroad station. not far away"

'' we tell the truth , '' said co- burn curtly , `` when we talk to the police. we tell the whole truth — except about dillon. that sounds thk invaders 121 too crazy. we tell it to top-level officials only , after they realize that something they do n't know anything about has really taken place. talk of invaders from space would either get us locked up as lunatics or would create a panic. this man will tell what happened up there , and they 'll investigate. but we take these so-called cam- eras to salonika , and get to an american battleship. '' he lifted dillon 's two cameras by the carrying-straps. and the straps pulled free. they 'd held the cases safely enough during a long journey on foot across the moun- tains. but they pulled clear now. coburn had a bitter thought. he struck a match. he saw the leather cases on the floor of the staff car. he picked up one of them. he took it to the light of the headlights , standing there in the resonant darkness of a street in a city of stone houses. the leather was brittle. it was friable , as if it had been in a fire. coburn plucked it open , and it came apart in his hands. inside there was the smell of scorched things. there was a gritty metallic powder. nothing else. the other carrying-case was in exactly the same condition. coburn muttered bitterly : '' they were set to destroy them- selves if they got into other hands than dillon's. we have n't a bit of proof that he was n't a human being. not a shred of proof ! '' he suddenly felt a sick rage , as if he had been played with and mocked. the raid from bulgaria was serious enough , of course. it would have killed hundreds of people and possibly hundreds of others would have been enslaved. but even that was secondary in coburn 's mind. the important thing was that there were invad- ers upon earth. non-human mon- sters , who passed for humans through disguise. they had been able to travel through space to land secretly upon earth. they moved unknown among men , learning the secrets of mankind , preparing for — what ? ill they got into salonika early afternoon of the next day , after many hours upon an antique rail- road train that puffed and grunted and groaned among interminable mountains. coburn got a"

'' coburn said , `` poly kala. orea. '' his office was empty. it was dustier than usual. his secretary was probably taking a holiday since he was supposed to be out of town. he grunted and sat down at the telephone. he called a man he knew. hallen — another ameri- can — was attached to a non- profit corporation which was at- tached to an agency which was supposed to cooperate with a committee which had something to do with nato. hallen an- swered the phone in person. coburn identified himself.

'' i was there , '' said coburn. `` i brought the news down. can you come over ? '' '' i 'm halfway there now ! '' said hallen as he slammed down the phone. coburn paced up and down his office. it was very dusty. even the seat of the chair at his secre- tary 's desk was dusty. the odds the invaders 123 were that she was coming in only to sort the mail , and not even sit- ting down for that. he shrugged. he heard footsteps. the door opened. h is secretary , helena , came in. she looked surprised. '' i was at lunch , '' she explained. she had a very slight accent. she hung up her coat. `` i am sorry. i stopped at a store. '' he had paused in his pacing to nod at her. now he stared , but her back was turned toward him. he blinked. she had just told a very transparent lie. and helena was normally very truthful. '' you had a good trip ? '' she asked politely. '' fair , '' said coburn. `` any phone calls this morning ? `` he asked. '' not this morning , '' she said politely. she reached in a desk drawer. she brought out paper. she put it in the typewriter and began to type. coburn felt very queer. then he saw something else. there was a fly in the office - — a large , green- bodied fly of metallic lustre. the inhabitants of salonika said with morbid pride that it was a spe- cialty of the town , with the most painful of all known fly stings. and helena abhorred flies. it landed on the bare skin of her neck. she did not notice. it stayed there. ordinarily she would have jumped up , exclaiming angrily in greek , and then she would have pursued the fly vengefully witli a folded newspaper until she killed it. but now she ignored it. hallen came in , stamping. co- burn closed the door behind him. he felt queer at the pit of his stomach. for helena to let a fly stay on her neck suggested that her skin was . . . somehow not like its usual self.

'' i do n't know whether i 'm crazy or not , '' he said bitterly. '' but i was in your office. i saw your secretary there — and she did n't feel pins stuck in her. and something did happen to those bulgarians that the greeks do n't know anything about , or the americans either. so you 're to tell the invadkks 127 your story to the high brass down in athens. i think you 'll be locked up afterward as a lunatic — and me with you for believing my own eyes. but a plane 's being readied.

'' i 've been trying to get you. have you tried to reach me ? '' '' why , no. why ? '' janice 's voice said : `` i 've some- thing interesting to tell you. i left the office an hour ago. i 'm at the place where i live when i 'm in salonika. write down the address. can you come here ? i 've found out something astonishing ! '' he wrote down the address. he had a feeling of nightmarishness. this was not janice — • '' i 'm clearing up some matters you 'll guess at , '' he said grimly , '' so i may be a little while getting there. you 'll wait ? '' he hung up. and then with a rather ghastly humor he took some pins from a box on the desk and worked absorbedly at bending one around the inside of the band of the seal ring he wore on his right hand. but he did n't go to the tele- phoned address. he went to the breen foundation. and janice was there. she was the real janice. he knew it instantly he saw her. she was panic-stricken when he told her of his own telephone ex- perience. her teeth chattered. but she knew — instinctively , she said — that he was himself. she got into the cab with him. they reached the airport and found the office hallen had named. the lettering on it , in greek and french , said that it was a reception room for official visitors only. '' our status is uncertain , '' said coburn drily. `` we may be official guests , or we may be crazy. it 's a toss-up which status sticks."

'' howdo , coburn , '' said hallen painfully. `` you 're heading for athens , you know. this is miss ames ? but these gentlemen have ... ah ... a special concern with that business up-country. they 'd like to hear your story before you leave. '' '' i suppose , '' said coburn 128 amazing storiks curtly , `` it 's a sort of preliminary commission in lunacy. '' but he shook hands all around. he kept his left hand in his coat pocket as he shook hands with his right. his revolver was in his left- hand pocket now too. the greek general beamed at him. the american colonel 's eyes were hard and suspicious. one of the two greek colonels was very slightly cross-eyed. the greek major shook hands solemnly. coburn took a deep breath. `` i know my tale sounds crazy , '' he said , `` but ... i had a telephone call just now. hallen will bear me out that my secretary was imper- sonated by somebody else this afternoon. '' '' i 've told them that , '' said hallen unhappily.

'' the american colonel snorted : '' this whole tale 's preposterous ! it 's an attempt to cash in on the actual mystery of what happened up-country.

'' then there was a sensation of intolerable brightness all around. but it was not actual light. it was a sensation inside one 's brain. coburn felt himself falling. he knew , somehow , that the others the invaders 129 were falling too. he saw everyone in the room in the act of slumping limply to the floor — all but the greek major. and coburn felt a bitter , despairing fury as con- sciousness left him. iv he came to in a hospital room , with a nurse and two doctors and an elaborate oxygen-administering apparatus. the apparatus was wheeled out. the nurse followed. the two doctors hurried after her. the american colonel of the air- port was standing by the bed on which coburn lay , fully dressed. coburn felt perfectly all right. he stirred. the american colonel said sourly : `` you 're not harmed. nobody was. but major pangalos got away. '' coburn sat up. there was a moment 's bare trace of dizziness , and that was gone too. coburn said : `` where 's miss ames ? what happened to her ? '' '' she 's getting oxygen , '' said the colonel. `` we were rushed here from the airport , sleeping soundly just like those bulgarians. major pangalos ordered it before he dis- appeared. helicopters brought some bulgarians down , by the way , and oxygen brought them to. so naturally they gave us the same treatment. very effective.

'' '' that goes to headquarters at once ! '' snapped the colonel. he went out briskly. coburn followed him out of the room to look for janice. and janice hap- pened to be looking for him at exactly the same moment. he was genuinely astonished to realize how relieved he was that she was all right. he said apologetically : `` i was worried ! when i felt myself pass- ing out i felt pretty rotten at having failed to protect you. '' she looked at him with nearly the same sort of surprised satis- faction. `` i 'm all right , '' she said breathlessly. `` i was worried about you.

'' all safe now !

'' i wish i knew , '' said the american colonel vexedly , `` if 132 amazing stokiks those creatures were only testing weapons , or if they were getting set to start bargaining with us ! '' '' meaning ? '' asked coburn. '' if they 're here , '' said the colonel angrily , `` and if they do mean to meddle in our business , they may set up a sort of auction with us bidding against the iron curtain gang for their friendship. and they 'd make any deal ! '' the greek general agreed drily. he said that free people were not practical people. they were al- ways ready to die rather than cease to be free. surely the greeks had proved themselves ready to die. but people like the bulgarians thought that to con- tinue to live was the most im- portant thing in the world. it was , of course , the practical view- point. . . . '' they can have it ! '' growled coburn. janice said hesitantly : `` but the invaders have n't killed any- body we know of. they could have killed the bulgarians. they didn't. the one who called him- self dillon stopped one man from killing them. and they could have killed us , earlier today at the air- port. could they want to be friends ? `` '' they 're starting the wrong way , '' said coburn. the greek general stirred in his seat , but he was pointedly silent. the pilot snapped abruptly from up at the bow of the plane : '' colonel ! sir ! two of the fighters are climbing as if they 've spotted something. there go the rest.

' ' what 's that ? ' ' demanded someone authoritatively. the greek . general said it again , mildly. this latest attempt to seize them or harm them — if it was that — had been surpris- ingly inept. it was strange that creatures able to travel between the stars and put regiments and tanks out of action should fail so dismally to kill or kidnap coburn , if they really wanted to. could it be that they were not quite sin- cere in their efforts ? '' that , '' said the authoritative voice , `` is an idea ! '' they readied the waterfront. and here in the darkest part of the night and with the moon near to setting , the waters of the bay of naples rolled in small , smooth- surfaced , tranquil waves. there was a navy barge waiting. those who had come by plane boarded it. it cast off and headed out into the middle of the huge harbor. in minutes there was a giant hull looming overhead. they stepped out onto a landing ladder and climbed interminably up the ship 's metal side. then there was an open door. '' now , '' said the american colonel triumphantly , `` now ev- erything 's all right ! nothing can happen now , short of an atomic bomb ! `` the greek general glanced at him out of the corner of his eyes. he said something in that heavy accent of his. he asked mildly if creatures — invaders — who could travel between the stars were unlikely to be able to make atom bombs if they wanted to. there was no answer. but some- body led coburn into an office where this carrier 's skipper was at his desk. he looked at coburn with a sardonic , unfriendly eye. '' mr. coburn , i believe , '' he said remotely. `` you 've been very welt staged-managed by your friends , mr. coburn. they 've made it look as if they were trying hard to kill you , eh ? but we know better , do n't we ? we know it 's all a build-up for you to make a deal for them , eh ? well , mr. coburn , you 'll find it 's going to"

'' and this was coburn 's first inkling that he was regarded as a traitor of his planet who had sold out to the invaders. all the plans made from his information would be based on the supposition that he intended to betray mankind by misleading it. v it was not yet forty-eight hours since coburn had been inter- rupted in the act of starting his car up in ardea. greek newspa- pers had splashed lurid headlines of a rumored invasion by bul- garians , and their rumored defeat. the story was not widely copied. it sounded too unlikely. in a few hours it would be time for a new set of newspapers to begin to appear. not one of them would print a single word about the most important disclosure in human history : that extra-terrestrial in- vaders moved blandly about among human beings without being suspected. the newspapers did n't know it. on inside pages and bottom cor- ners , the london papers might refer briefly to the remarkable rumor that had swept over greece about an invasion force said to have crossed its border. the lon- don papers would say that the greek government officially de- nied that such a happening had taken place. the new york pa- pers would be full of a political scandal among municipal officials , the washington papers would deal largely with a congressional in- vestigation committee hearing , los angeles would have a new and gory murder to exploit , san francisco news would be of a water-front strike , tokyo would talk of cherry blossoms , delhi of pakistan , and the french press would discuss the political crisis. but no newspaper , anywhere , would talk about invaders. in the united states radar technicians had been routed out of bed and informed that night fighters had had a fight with an alien ship manned by non-hu- mans and had destroyed it , but their radars detected nothing at all. an hour after sunrise in naples they had come up with a combina- 139 tion of radar frequencies which were built to detect everything. instructions were going out in code to all radar establishments on how to set it up on existing equipment. long before that time , business machines had begun in- tricate operations with punched cards containing all known facts about the people known to have dropped out of sight. other ma- chines began to integrate crackpot reports of things sighted in divers places. the stores of hunter and nereid rockets — especially the remote-control jobs — were brok- en out. great air transport planes began to haul them to where"

' there was earnest effort to secure cooperation from behind the iron curtain , but that did not work. the iron curtain stood pat , demanding the most detailed of information and the privilege of inspecting all weapons intended for use against anybody so far unnamed , but refusing all infor- mation of its own. in fact , there was a very normal reaction every- where , except that the newspapers did n't know anything to print. these secret hassles were con- tinuing as the dawnlight moved over italy and made naples and its harbor quite the most beauti- ful place in the world. when day- light rolled over france , matters were beginning to fall into pat- tern. as daybreak moved across the atlantic , at least the measures to be taken began to be visualized and orders given for their ac- complishment. and then , with sunrise in amer- ica , real preparations got under way. but hours earlier there was con- sultation on the carrier in the bay of naples. coburn sat in a ward- room in a cold fury which was in part despair. he had been kept in complete ignorance of all meas- ures taken , and he felt the raging indignation of a man accused of treason. he was being questioned again. he was treated with an icy courtesy that was worse than accusation. the carrier skipper mentioned with detachment that , of course , coburn had never been in any danger. obviously. the event in the airport at salonika and the attack on the convoy were window-dressing. they were not attempts to withdraw him from circulation , but to draw at- tention to him. which , of course , 140 amazing stok1es implied that the invaders — who- ever or whatever they might be — considered coburn a useful tool for whatever purpose they in- tended. tins was before the conference officially began. it took time to arrange. there were radio tech- nicians with microphones. the consultation — - duly scrambled and re-scrambled — would be re- layed to washington while it was on. it was a top level conference. hallen was included , but he did not seem happy. then things were ready. the skipper of the carrier took over , with full awareness that the very highest brass in washington was listening to every word.

'' '' my guess , '' snapped coburn , '' is that they want earth. '' the skipper raised his eyebrows. '' are you threatening us in their name ? '' he asked , purring.

'' if anybody else in the world feels as futile as i do , '' said co- burn bitterly , `` i feel sorry for him ! '' janice said softly : `` you 've got me. '' but that was less than complete comfort. it is inborn in a man that lie needs in feel superior. no man can feel pride before the woman of his choice while there is some- thing stronger than himself. and coburn especially wanted to feel that pride just now. there were very probably dis- cussions of the important part of what coburn had reported , of co u rse , during the rest of the morning. but there was much more discussion of purely military measures. and of course there were attempts to get military in- telligence. things were reported in the sky near south africa , and from honolulu — - where nobody would ignore what a radar said again , especially the juiced-up eq uipmcn t j ust modified on or- ders — and from other places. not all the reports were authentic , of course. if there were any ob- servations inside the iron curtain , the iron curtain countries kept them to themselves. politics was much more important than any- thing else , in that part of the world. hut coburn need not have felt as futile as he did. there was just one really spectacular occurrence in connection with the invaders that day , and it happened where coburn was. almost certainly , it happened because coburn was there. though there is reason to believe that the newspaper cam- paign on shore , declaring that the american fleet risked the lives of all naples by its mere presence. the invadkrs 143 had something to do with it too. it was very spectacular. it happened just after midday when the city and its harbor were at their most glamorous. coburn and janice were above when it began. there was an ensign as- signed to escort coburn about and keep an eye on him , and he took them on a carefully edited tour of the carrier. he took them to the radar room which was not secret any longer. he explained reservedly that there was a new tricked-up"

'' a dull , faint sound came from high overhead. coburn stepped out from under the shelter of the upper works of the island. he stared up into the sky. he saw a lurid spot of blue-white flame. he saw others , lie realized that all the sky was interlaced with con- trails — vapor-trails of jet-planes far up out of sight. but thjsy were fine threads. the jets were up very high indeed. the pin-points of flame were explosions.

'' there were more explosions. there was a bright glint of re- flected sunshine. it was momen- tary , but coburn knew that it was from a flat , bright space-ship , which had tilted in some mon- strously abrupt maneuver , and the almost vertical sunshine shone down from its surface. the ensign said in a very quiet voice : `` the fight 's coming lower. '' there was a crashing thump in the air. a battleship was firing 146 eight-inch guns almost straight up. other guns began. guns began to fire on the car- rier , too , below the deck and be- yond it. concussion waves beat at cobu rn 's body. he thrust janice behind him to shield her , but there could be no shielding. the air was filled with barkings and snarlings and the unbelieva- bly abrupt roar of heavy guns. the carrier swerved , so swiftly that it tilted and swerved again. the other ships of the fleet broke their straight-away formation and began to move in bewildering patterns. the blue sea was criss- crossed with wakes. once a de- stroyer seemed to slide"

'' the greek general looked at him enigmatically. '' we 've still got one trick left , '' said coburn. `` atomic bombs. and if they fail , we can still get killed fighting them another way. '' there was a heavy , droning noise far away. it increased and drew nearer. it was a multi- engined plane which came from the west and settled down , and hovered over the water and touched and instantly created a spreading wake of foam. the fleet was back at anchor then. it was enclosed in the most beautiful combination of city and scene that exists anywhere. be- yond the city the blunted cone of vesuvius rose. in the city , news- paper vendors shrilly hawked de- nunciations of the american ships because of the danger that their atom bombs might explode. well outside the harbor , a navy crew of experts worked to make quite- impossible the detonation of atomic bombs in a stubby tramp- steamer which had — plausibly , at least — been sent to make those same newspapers ' prophe- cies of disaster come true. a long , long time passed , while consultations took place to which coburn was not invited. then a messenger led him to the ward- room of the previous conference. he recognized the men who had landed by seaplane a while since. one was a cabinet member from washington. there was someone of at least equal importance from london , picked up en route. there were generals and admirals. the service officers looked at coburn l50 with something like accusation in their eyes. he was the means by which they had come to realize their impotence. the greek gen- eral sat quietly in the rear. '' mr. coburn , '' said the sec- retary from washington , `` we 've been canvassing the situation. it seems that we simply are not pre- pared to offer effective resistance — not yet — - to the . . . invad- ers you tell us about. we know of no reason why this entire fleet could not have been disabled as effectively as the tramp-steamer offshore. you know about that ship ? '' coburn nodded. the greek general had told him. the secre- tary went on painfully : `` now , the phenomena we have to as- cribe to invaders fall into two categories. one is the category of their action against the bulgarian raiding force , and today the pre- vention of the cold-war murder of some hundreds of thousands of people. that category suggests that they are prepared — on terms — to be amiable. a point in their favor.

' ' '' i do n't know what it could be , '' '' said coburn coldly. `` i blundered into one affair. i figured out a way to detect them. i hap- pened to be the means by which they were proved to exist. that 's all. it was an accident. '' the secretary looked skeptical. '' your discoveries were remark- ably . . . apt. and it does seem clear that they made the appear- ance of hunting you , while going to some pains not to catch you. mr. coburn , how can we make contact with them ? '' coburn wanted to swear furi- ously. he was still being con- sidered a traitor. only they were trying to make use of his treason. '' i have no idea , '' he said grimly. '' what do they want ? '' '' i would say — earth , '' he said grimly. ' ' you deny that you are an authorized intermediary for them ? '' ' ' absolutely , '' said coburn. there was silence. the greek general spoke mildly from the back of the room. he said in his difficult english that coburn 's personal motives did not matter. but if the invaders had picked him out as especially important , it was possible that they felt him especially qualified to talk to them. the question was , would he try to make contact with them ? the secretary looked pained , the invaders 151 but he turned to coburn. `` mr. coburn ? '' coburn said , `` i 've no idea how to set about it , but i 'll try on one condition. there 's one thing we have n't tried against them. set up an alom-bomb booby-trap , and i 'll sit on it. if they try to contact me , you can either listen in or try to blow them up , and me with them ! '' there was buzzing comment. perhaps — coburn 's nails bit into his palms when this was suggested — perhaps this was a proposal to let the invaders examine an atomic bomb , american-style. it was said in earnest simplicity. but somebody pointed out that a race which could travel between the stars and had ships such as the mediterranean fleet had tried to shoot down , would probably find american atomic bombs rather primitive. still — the greek general again spoke mildly. if the invaders were to be made to realize that coburn was trying to contact them , he should return to greece. he should visi- bly take up residence where he could be approached. he should , in fact , put himself completely at the mercy of"

'' ostensibly , '' agreed the sec- retary. the greek general then said diffidently that he had a small villa some twenty miles from the suburbs of salonika. the prevail- ing winds were such that if an atomic explosion occurred there , it would not endanger anybody. he offered it. '' i 'll live there , '' asked coburn coldly , ' ' and wait for them to come to me ? i 'll have microphones all about so that every word that 's said will be relayed to your re- corders ? and there 'll be a bomb somewhere about that you can set off by remote control ? is that the idea ? '' then janice spoke up. and co- burn flared into anger against her. but she was firm. coburn saw the greek general smiling slyly. they left the conference while the decision was made. and they were in private , and janice talked to him. there are methods of ar- gument against which a man is hopeless. she used them. she said that she , not coburn , might be the person the invaders might have wanted to take out of circu- lation , because she might have noticed something important she had n't realized yet. when coburn pointed out that he 'd be living over an atomic bomb , triggered to be set off from a hundred miles away , she demanded fiercely to know if he realized how she 'd feel if she were n't there to. . . . next day an aircraft carrier put out of naples with an escort of destroyers. it traveled at full speed down the toe of italy 's boot , through the straits of mes- sina , across the adriatic , and 152 rounded the end of greece and went streaking night and day for salonika. special technicians sent by plane beat her time by days. the greek general was there well ahead. and he expansively super- vised while his inherited , isolated vilka was prepared for the recep- tion of invaders — and coburn and janice. and coburn and janice were married. it was an impressive wedding , because it was desirable for the invaders to know about it. it was brilliantly military with uniforms and glittering decora- tions and innumerable important people whom neither of them knew or cared about. it it had been anybody else 's wedding coburn would have found it unspeakably dreary. the only person present whom he knew beside janice was hallen. he acted as groomsman , with the air of someone walking on eggs. after it was over he shook hands with a manner of tremendous re- lief.

'' '' oh yes , '' said hallen uncom- fortably. `` but that was n't just what i had in mind. '' vii the world wagged on. the newspapers knew nothing about super-secret top-level worries. there was not a single newsstory printed anywhere suggesting an invasion of earth from outer space. there were a few more flying saucer yarns than normal , and it was beginning to transpire that an unusual number of im- portant people were sick , or on vacation , or otherwise out of con- tact with the world. but , actually , not one of the events in which co- burn and janice had been con- cerned reached the state of being news. even the shooting off the bay of naples was explained as an emergency drill. quietly , a good many things happened. cryptic orders passed around , and oxygen tanks were accumulated in military posts. hunter and mereid guided mis- siles were set up as standard equip- ment in a number of brand-new places. they were loaded for bear. -but days went by , and nothing happened. nothing at all. but officialdom was not at ease. i f anything — - while the wide world went happily about its business — - really high-level offi- cialdom grew more unhappy day by day. coburn and janice flew back to salonika. they went in a navy plane with a fighter plane escort. they landed at the salon- ika airport , and the greek general the invaders 153 was among those who greeted them . he took them out to the villa he 'd placed at the disposal of high authority for their use. he displayed it proudly. there was absolutely no sign that it had been touched by anybody since its original builders had finished with it two-hundred-odd years before. the american officer who had wired it , though — he looked as if he were short a week 's sleep — showed them how anywhere on the grounds or in the house they would need only to speak a code- word and they 'd instantly be answered. there were servants , and the greek general took coburn aside and assured him that there was one room which absolutely was not wired for sound. he named it. so they took up a relatively normal way of life. sometimes they decided that it would be pleasant to drive in to salonika. they mentioned it , and went out and got in the car that went with the villa. oddly , there was always some aircraft lazying about over- head by the time they were out of the gate. they always returned before sunset. and sometimes they swam in the water before the villa 's door. then , also , they were careful to be back on solid ground before sunset. that was so their guards out on the water would n't have to worry. but it was a nagging and an un-"

'' that was standard. when the general arrived ; when the occa- sional delivery of telephoned-for supplies came ; on the one occa- sion when a peddler on foot had entered the ground. it lacked something of being the perfect atmosphere for a honeymoon , but it was the way things were. presently there were headlights outside. the greek butler went to greet the guests. coburn and janice heard voices. the general was in uproarious good humor. he came in babbling completely uncomprehensible knglish. there was helena. she smiled warmly at coburn. she went at once to janice. `` how dp you do ? '' she said in her prettily ac- cented english. `` i have missed not working for your husband , but this is my fiance !

'' we are the guests this whole villa was set up to receive ! the last time i saw you was in naousa , and the last time helena saw you you stuck pins in her , and — `` coburn stiffened. he went slowly pale. '' i — see ! you 're the foam-suit people , eh ? '' then he looked with hot passion at the general. '' you ! '' he said grimly. `` you i did n't suspect. you 've made fools of all of us , i think.

'' he is fat. so his eyes do n't look the invaders 155 like they 're different. you have to see past his cheeks and eyebrows. that 's how he passed muster. and he slept very soundly after the airport affair. '' cob urn felt a sort of sick hor- ror. the general had passed as a man , and he 'd loaned this villa , and he knew all about the in- stallation of the atomic bomb. . . . then coburn looked through a doorway and there was his greek butler standing in readiness with a submachine-gun in his hands. '' 1 take it this is an official call , '' said coburn steadily. `` in that case you know we 're over- heard — or did the general can- cel that ? '' '' oh , yes !

'' pop eyed the ready blaster and nodded again. he wondered vaguely how it would feel to die under the blast of such a weapon. it could n't be very painful. he hoped it was n't painful. perhaps the boy had n't suffered. it would be nice to be sure , he thought. there was n't much for pop to remember about the boy. he 'd never been one for writing many letters. but the district patrol- man had come down to yakki and looked pop up — afterward. he 'd said the boy was a good officer. a good cop. died doing his job , and all that sort of thing. pop swallowed hard. his job. what had 'his job ' been that night in lower marsport , he wondered. had someone else finished it for him ?"

'' made this trip often ? '' pop tried to strike up a conversation with kane. his long loneliness seemed sharper , somehow , more turnover toint 73 poignant , when he actually had someone to talk to.

'' '' yes , sir. '' '' may i see your identification ? `` i handed him my wallet. he flipped through the panels holding my press pass , social security card , driver 's license and a picture of lois in a bathing suit. when he failed to do more than give the latter a casual glance i knew this was a man with a troubled mind. i said , `` maybe you could give me kind of a hint on what 's going on. '' '' going on ? '' he repeated ab- sently. '' you know — -going on. '' i got off a nonchalant-type laugh that would have fooled anybody who was deaf. `` i even heard that the president wanted to see me ! '' he gave me back the wallet. '' ah — yes. come with me , please. '' we left the office and went down a hall , around some corners and down more halls , past a lot of doors , all of them closed. fi- nally he stopped in front of a pair of doors with shiny brass doorknobs , knocked twice , then turned the knob , said , `` mr. quinlan , gentlemen , '' shoved me through with a jerk of his chin , and closed the door behind me. i never saw him again. there was a long table down the center of a long narrow room. the"

'' he reeled off names and titles. the two strangers were a mr. proudfit and a mr. kramer , occupations not disclosed. kramer was small and ageless , with a weather-beaten face and a mouth like a steel trap ; while mr. proudfit had the look of a benign monk , until you saw the tempered call him savage steel glint in his piercing eyes. when introductions were com- pleted , i said , `` how do you do ? '' once , including them all , and went on waiting. nobody sug- gested i sit down , probably be- cause there were only five chairs around the table to begin with and the room 's two couches were too far away to keep me in the group. the president gave me the same winning smile that had pulled a couple million extra votes his way in the last election , and said , `` let me start off , mr. quinlan , by telling you that we 've got a problem on our hands — one that may very well involve the peace and well-being of the entire country. the details are going to strain your credulity beyond human limits , i 'm afraid — just as they have ours. but there is enough supporting evi- dence to what we 've heard for us to do something about it. and that 's where you come in.

'' kramer leaned back in his chair , placed the tips of his fin- gers together and stared search- 95 ingly at me over them. his voice , when he spoke , was as dry as his skin. `` mr. — ah — quinlan , i understand you were born thirty- one years ago on a potawatomi indian reservation in the state of michigan. '' i blinked. `` that 's right. not many people know it. '' '' you are part indian , i be- lieve ? '' '' one quarter potawatomi. '' '' also , i 'm told that you are something of an authority on the history of the american indian. '' '' i 've written books on the sub- ject and expect to write a good many more. '' '' you speak the language ? '' '' what language ? '' he floundered a little. `` why — ah — the — ■ ah — > indian lan- guage. '' '' look , mr. kramer , '' i said , '' there are scores of indian lan- guages. nobody in history , red man or white , could ever speak all of them. fortunately most indians belonged to one of sev- eral great families , and the lan- guage of each family was close enough for the tribes in that family to understand each other. i can handle the language of the algonkin like a native , being part potawatomi myself. i can get by in the tongue of the iroquois , the caddoan , the siouan , and the muskhogean. the dene and uto- aztecan would give me consider- able trouble , while the penutian would be just about a blank. '' i stopped there , and shrugged. '' sorry. i did n't mean to turn this into a lecture.

'' i felt the tendons in my legs tighten , pulling me into a slight crouch. i was back a hundred and seventy years in the past , with a dull anger starting to move around in me. `` wetzel , '' i said , making it sound like a dirty word. `` any relation to lewis wetzel ? '' the young man 's eye.s widened with astonishment and obvious relief. `` well , now , i reckon so ! lew 's my uncle. '' '' lew wetzel , '' i said between call him savage my teeth , `` is a low , stinking , murdering skunk ! '' i ducked just in time to keep from being brained by the swing- ing stock of the long gun. i came up under it quicker than i 'd ever moved before in my life and nailed him on the jaw with a solid right , getting my shoulder behind it. it was like hitting the hall of justice. he grunted and up came the rifle butt for another try. suddenly the room was bulging with strangers. a dozen arms folded around the young man , the gun was ripped from his fingers and he hit the rug with a thump that shook the room. the buck- skin-covered legs threshed briefly , then were still. i moistened my lips and backed away as sanity returned. i looked at the frozen faces around the table. `` my fault , mr. president. i ca n't blame you for thinking i 'm as crazy as he is. but , as mr. kramer mentioned , i 'm part in- dian."

'' the president was n't smiling now. `` perhaps i should have told you before , mr. quinlan , we may desperately need this young man 's 97 assistance in the near future. '' i almost blurted out the wrong thing , but bit my lip instead and remained silent. the president 's eyes swung to the heap of hu- manity on the floor. `` let him up , boys. i 'll call you if i need you again. '' the six secret service men rose and stood enoch wetzel on his feet , then returned to the adjoin- ing office , not looking too happy about leaving a madman with the chief executive. wetzel pushed the long hair off his forehead and stood there glowering at me , spots of angry color in his dark cheeks. i said , `` forget it , mac. i made a small mistake. '' his thin lips peeled back in a snarl. `` half breed ! '' i took it , although nothing was ever harder for me to do. kramer hurriedly stepped into the breach. '' mr. — ah — wetzel , we 're wait- ing for you to repeat what you told us before. '' the tall , broad-shouldered young man turned from me to face the long table. there was a grace- ful dignity about him , in his posture , in the way he held his head , that you do n't see often. again i felt the hair move along my scalp. for a guy who was as nutty as peanut brittle , he was certainly convincing in his role of frontiersman. turn back the clock far enough and this could have been one of general an- thony wayne 's scouts at the bat- tle of fallen timbers. he even swelled the part. '' my father got hisself put on by general harmer as a scout a fortnight back. the general , on orders from president washing- ton , was to lead his sojers to the north after the injuns up there. pop allowed as i was ready to try my luck agin the abbregynes , so he took me along.

'' he stood slim and straight as a shawnee arrow , smooth-faced and solemn , obviously not much past his twentieth birthday , yet by his own account born before the declaration of independence was on paper. he went on talking , sounding like a character out of james fenimore cooper. his story , boiled down and translated , came out something like this : the sudden arrival of the strange object had literally paralyzed the indian encampment. the war- riors dropped their weapons and called on the spirits to protect them , while a hole opened in the side of what could n't be anything else but a spaceship. then out of the opening came huge steel caricatures of men."

'' the bomber pilot was a fresh- faced youngster who chewed gum and claimed to have been the second -ranking tennis player in des moines , iowa. he shook hands gravely with me , eyed wet- zel and his strange garb and out- size rifle with blank-faced wonder , and mentioned that it was a nice night for flving. the plane took off at 1:27. we were due over our target by 4:00 o'clock eastern standard time , or 2 :00 mountain time. the plans called for the bomber to fly at a high altitude , then come in on burdette with jets off and drop us by 'chute. wetzel had balked for a while at the idea of stepping 105 off into space , but a brief but pa- tient explanation of how a para- chute worked finally brought him grudgingly around. the trip seemed to take for- ever. i was torn by a thousand doubts , saddened by not being al- lowed to say goodbye to lois , not a little afraid of what i would likely run into in colorado. and all the while , my companion , out of his normal world and time , sur- rounded by wonders beyond his wildest nightmares , slept sound as an infant. . . . a hand shook me awake. in the faint glow of a flashlight i made out the face of the co-pilot. '' twenty minutes , mr. quinlan. '' wetzel was already on his feet. the co-pilot helped us don the 'chutes , and five minutes before arrival opened the heavy side door. a rush of wind tore in , but there was no other sound. the jets had already cut off and the plane was gradually losing alti- tude in a shallow dive. as this was not a plane used for parachute troops there was no wire to hook the 'chute cord to. it meant we would have to pull our own , but both of us had been thoroughly versed in what to do. '' get ready , '' shouted the co- pilot. i grasped the door frame and waited , my heart pounding in my ears. wetzel stood directly behind me , the muzzle-loader in his hand , the tail of his coonskin cap bounc- ing in the wind , his eyes narrowed.

'' i dived headfirst into blackness. i spun madly earthward , but in the back'of my mind a calm voice counted off the seconds. then i yanked at the ring-cord , black folds of nylon rustled above me , i heard a sharp report like the crack of a giant whip , the straps at my shoulders yanked painfully , and i was floating gently down toward the night-shrouded sur- face of colorado. i landed in a meadow , if that was what they called it this far west. i came down hard but in the way they had told me would pre- vent injury. there was no wind to yank me about before i could un- ship the parachute , and within seconds i was on my feet and searching for some sign of enoch wetzel. unexpectedly a hand struck me lightly on the back. i was jumping aside and reaching for my gun when the frontiersman 's quiet voice reached me. `` you scare mighty easy for an injun. '' i said , `` we should be about a mile , two at the most , south of the road where that army tank picked you up yesterday afternoon. let 's find it. '' '' aye. '' the land was by no means as flat as i had expected. fortunately 106 most of it was relatively open , with only scattered clumps of trees and bushes. there were too many small unexplained night sounds , but none of these appeared to alarm wetzel in the slightest , so i managed to ignore them. once we flushed a long-eared rab- bit , and it was five minutes before i could get my heart out of my throat. a barbed -wire fence , the first we had encountered , told me we had reached a road. it was n't paved or even graveled — just a ribbon of dirt pointing east and west as straight as an apache lance. nothing moved along it in either direction as far as 1 could see. a line of telephone poles bordered one side. '' recognize any landmarks ? '' i asked. wetzel shook his head. '' we 're probably east of where you were found , '' i said. `` we might as well start walking. '' he grunted in agreement and we started out. it was a lovely starlit night , no moon at this hour , and a lot warmer than i had ex- pected for october in colorado. now and then the road dipped and climbed , and as we reached the crest of the third hill , i saw a good -sized farmhouse set well back from the road among a group of out-buildings. i pointed to the house. `` maybe they can tell us what 's been hap- pening around here. '' wetzel nodded and we turned in at a fieldstone path leading across the large yard to the front door."

'' scalped ! '' i whispered hoarsely. enoch wetzel stooped sud- denly and picked up the shotgun and wordlessly held it out to me. my jaw fell in astonishment. the twin barrels were bent into a rude v. i licked my lips and backed away. `` let 's get out of here , wetzel. '' he tossed the gun aside and we turned back to the road. neither of us said anything for fully a mile. `` no human hands could have done that to a gun , '' i said. '' i 'm beginning to believe what you said about robots. robots that take scalps !

'' we went on. several times wetzel 's long , swinging , tireless stride left me behind and he was forced to wait until i caught up with him again. i had the feeling that i was holding him back , and there was something faintly con- temptuous in his obvious patience. but the life of a book-writing newspaper man had n't prepared me for cross-country marathons , and there was nothing to be done about it now. the fairly level , open ground was giving place to a heavily wooded countryside. after an- other mile of winding roadway , wetzel suddenly turned aside and plunged into the forest. it was as dark as the inside of an under- taker 's hat , and after i had banged into a few dozen trees and tripped over a few dead branches , making enough racket to alert half the state , wetzel slowed his pace to a crawl. finally i grabbed one of the fringed sleeves of his buckskin shirt to stop him and sank down on a fallen log. `` how much far- ther ? '' he leaned his folded arms on the muzzle of his long gun and i could feel his deep-set eyes study- ing me without approval. ' '' nother hour ; p'rhaps more. dependin ' on you.

'' he removed his hand and i could breathe again. we lay there side by side close to a huge tree , deep in the shadows. and then faintly as from far off i heard the crackle of disturbed undergrowth and , slowly louder and louder , an evenly spaced thumping sound that seemed to shake the earth. through the trees it came , di- rectly toward the spot where wet- zel and i hugged the ground. it loomed against the night , a tower of steel on jointed legs , a horrible travesty of the human figure , a head like king arthur 's helmet. starlight picked out two round faceted eyes of glass. my suddenly dry mouth puck- ered with the taste of terror. i did not breathe ; even my heart seemed to beat no more. i wanted to close my eyes , but even the lids seemed paralyzed. _ for almost a full minute the giant robot remained standing less than ten feet from where wetzel and i were lying. it seemed to sense the presence of something of flesh and blood nearby. its head turned slowly from side to side in little uneven jerks that put ice cubes in my veins. finally the mammoth feet began their rhythmic thumping and a moment later it disappeared among the trees. after what seemed a long time wetzel rose to his feet. i got up slowly and leaned against the tree. `` in a little while , '' i said softly , `` i 'll wake up. i 'll be in bed with my wife , under the nice clean white sheets , and i 'll know all this was a nightmare brought on by that canned salmon we had for dinner.

'' let 's go , '' i said. an hour or so later , after taking a twisting route through what seemed to be the belgian congo , wetzel halted under the spreading branches of a towering cotton- wood. with his lips close to my ear , he whispered , `` it 's a-settin ' out thar midst open ground. '' he gestured at the wall of blackness hemming us in — blackness you could have cut into hunks with an ax. `` i 'm thinkin ' thar 's plenty 'o them iron critters roamin ' 'round twixt us an ' it. you aimin ' to await the dawn ? '' '' you , '' i said , `` said it ! '' the dawn came up nice and quiet. blackness turned gray and then a pearl pink — and there she was : a hundred yards from us , of some gleaming metal resembling aluminum , twenty feet high and covering about as much ground as a caretaker 's cottage. it re- sembled nothing more than a soup plate turned bottom up to dry. a tall , semi-circular opening showed black in one side , with a sloping metallic ramp reaching from it to the ground. two robots guarded the entrance , stiff and towering and without movement , the early light glistening along their jointed bodies. in sharp contrast to this scene from the distant future was the anachronistic spectacle of six in- call him savage 109 dians , in war paint , fringed buck- skin and stripped to the waist , squatting around a small cooking fire near the ship. within easy reach of each was a long bow and a quiver of arrows. nothing about them gave me a certain clue as to which indian family they belonged to. the sin- gle feather in each scalp lock was pure white with a vivid red tip. two of them wore the black paint of untried warriors , and all were gnawing on strips of meat ' grilled over the fire. wetzel , placid and silent , leaned on his rifle and calmly stuffed a cheek with a twist of black to- bacco. `` reckon they be a little hard to talk to ? '' he asked in a soft voice. i shrugged. `` only one way i know of to find out. '' '' thet fancy pistol you got could kill 'em all afore they get them bows unlimbered.

'' '' aye. '' i turned away from him. all i had to do now was step out from behind that tree and walk across the open ground. each of my feet suddenly weighed a ton. two steps into that clearing and the funeral could be monday. in- stinctively my hand crawled to- ward the .38 automatic hidden in my coveralls. it never got that far. suicide was so final. wetzel 's firm young mouth held an almost invisible sneer. deliberately i took out a ciga- rette , lighted it with an airy gesture and a match , dragged deeply on it twice and threw it away. i said , `` lay off that gun like i told you , '' and walked slowly out into the clearing. it got a rise out of them , all right. they were on their feet , arrows notched , before i had traveled three feet. i never even hesitated. once i had gone this far , the bluff had to be carried all the way out. i kept my spine stiff , my head erect , my hands con- spicuously empty at my sides. if my nerves were jumping i was 110 the only one who knew about it. it caught them just a shade off- balance , which was all i had hoped for. the one-sidedness of six drawn bows against one un- impressive and unarmed man eventually registered and the flint tips wavered , then turned aside. the tallest of the braves — a lean number the color of an old penny — ■ tossed his bow aside and deliberately stepped squarely in my path. there was an insolent arrogance in every line of his body — a body that topped my six feet a full three inches. i said , `` hi-yo , silver , '' and put my hip into his naked belly and grabbed his arm and threw him over my shoulder. he hit face first two yards away and plowed up a furrow of grass , flopped around a little , then lay still. nobody else moved , except me. i started for the spaceship again , not hurrying and not crawling , head still up , spine still stiff , eyes straight ahead. feet slithered in the grass behind me and the sound made the skin between my shoul- der blades twitch like an aching tooth. every instinct that had anything to"

'' my words , in the language of the delaware because of wetzel 's earlier remark , had no immediate effect , which was par for the course with any indian. not even his eyelids moved. the silence went on , building into tension. anyone unfamiliar with the ways of the indian would have taken another stab at it. i knew better. i had made my pitch ; now it was strictly up to him. finally his strong lips came un- stuck. `` i am lo-as-ro , war chief of the kornesh. '' it was the delaware tongue , all right , but with inflexions and nuances strange to me. `` how is it that your skin is white but you speak in the way of the orbiwah ? '' that last word , i judged , was what the indian in general was called wherever this speciman had come from. i said , `` in my blood is the blood of the orbiwah. that is why i am here , sent by the great chief of all white men. '' we squatted down facing each other on the ramp. at once a young brave brought out a long , elaborately carved peace-pipe. lo-as-ro put the bit to his mouth and puffed smoke toward the four cardinal points of the compass , then passed the pipe to me. the tobacco was far more aromatic than any i had come across be- fore. 112 with the amenities out of the way , the chief said , `` why has the white chief sent you to me ? '' '' to welcome you to the land of the white man. '' '' 1 come not to the land of the white man in peace. '' my eyes were as cold as his own. `` this we do not under- stand. the white man has no quarrel with the tribe of kor- nesh. '' '' the white man , '' lo-as-ro said sonorously , `` has taken from the orbiwah his land and his home. he has driven the orbiwah into small areas. he has killed buffalo and the bison and the deer , leaving the orbiwah to eat the meat of the horse or to starve. the orbiwah has been made foul with the diseases of the white man. '' '' all this , '' i said , `` was long , long ago. perhaps it was not right , but it is the way of life that the strong prevail and the weak perish.

'' '' from whence do you come ? '' i asked. he pointed dramatically to- ward the sky. `` from a great distance. up there are many worlds. '' '' tell me of your world , '' i said. the telling took a long time but not a word of it was dull. accord- ing to lo-as-ro , his world was a planet revolving about one of the stars in the big dipper. it was slightly smaller than earth , with about the same climates and de- velopment of life. it was peopled with only one race , the orbiwah , who lived much as the indians in america did before the arrival of the white man. recently space- ships from another planet in the same solar system had landed on the orbiwah world. these new- comers were friendly , had no thought of conquest , and pos- sessed a science and culture of amazing proportions. from them the orbiwah learned of a planet on which were men of their own kind. lo-as-ro , fired by the thought of establishing con- tact with people like himself , had borrowed spaceships manned by robots and crossed the void to earth. for weeks they had hov- ered in our atmosphere , at first saddened , then angered , by the call him savage 113 fate meted out to the indians. since the spaceships were able to move through time into the past , lo-as-ro hit on the idea of going back to the days when the indian was still in control of most of america. with the power at his control he could force the white man from the continent and restore the land to those who owned it. arriving near the close of the eighteenth century , he found a sizeable encampment of indians , brought the ship down among them , and summoned the chiefs to a council of war , where he outlined to them his plan. to his astonishment he found the chiefs suspicious of outside help and confident that they could defeat the white man alone. in vain did lo-as-ro explain that they were doomed ; they could not , or would not , believe that he had visited the future. he offered to take them ahead and let them see for themselves — an offer that was quickly refused. whereupon lo-as-ro decided to return to the present and wrest the land from the white man and hand it over"

'' no , noble lo-as-ro. return to your world and leave this one to the white man. he took it long ago and he will never give it up. i have spoken. '' the chief of the orbiwah smiled grimly. `` in the ship in which i arrived on your world is a small machine. it is working for me now. within its reach no weapon is useful , no explosion can take place , no signal can be sent. only man is not touched by this machine , but when it works he has no weapons with which to fight. each hour the influence of this machine widens. soon all this land will be helpless. then the robots will take charge and those who oppose them will be slain. '' i thought of the `` dead spot '' i had first heard about on the newscast the night before , and how it was steadily growing. i remembered the slain farmer with the missing scalp , the two com- panies of soldiers helpless without radio , guns and transportation. i thought of a mechanized amer- ica helpless before a few score of these spaceships . . . and i knew that counter-violence would be useless. '' give the country back to the indians !

'' one by one i presented my companions. yellow arm was johnny armin , an old school friend of mine ; iron eagle , with whom i had spent a year in korea , had his telephone listed under the name of luke riegel ; strong wind was sidney storm , whom i had met while spending a year in southern california ; and lone pine , known as lionel pat- terson , lived a few doors down the street from me in washington and shot eighteen holes any day in the low seventies. the color of their skins , the 115 unmistakable cast of their fea- tures , made up the only passport they needed. at the chief 's invi- tation we squatted in a rude circle at the top of the ramp , and the peace-pipe was brought out and passed around. presently lo-as-ro began to speak. the magnificent voice rolled out in tones like a cathedral organ , explaining how the ameri- can indian was to assume his rightful place in a world of his own. it was a vivid picture , painted by an orator equal to any of the almost legendary indian speakers , and they do n't come any better. unfortunately i was the only one present who could understand him. when it was over and lo-as-ro was smiling in confident expec- tation of their gratified excite- ment , johnny armin gave me a baffled glance. `` what the hell was that all about , sam ?

'' martha said nothing , fanned at a fly that crawled across his pil- low. the fly buzzed up in an an- gry spiral and alighted on the ceiling. donegal watched it for a time. the fly had natural-born space-legs. i know your tricks , he told it with a smile , and i learned to walk on the bottomside of things before you were a maggot. you stand there with your mag- nasoles hanging to the hull , and the rest of you 's in free fall. you jerk a sole loose , and your knee flies up to your belly , and reaction spins you half-around and near throws your other hip out of joint if you do n't jam the foot down fast and jerk up the other. it 's worse'n trying to run through knee-deep mud with snow-shoes , and a man 'll go nuts trying to keep his arms and legs from taking off in odd directions. i know your tricks , fly. but the fly was born with his magnasoles , and he trotted across the ceiling like donegal never could.

'' open the window , martha , '' he said. her tongue clucked faintly as she started to protest , but she said nothing. after frozen seconds , she sighed and went to open it. the curtains billowed , and a babble of conversation blew in from the terrace of the keith mansion. with the sound came the occasional brassy discord of a musician tuning his instrument. she clutched the window-sash as if she wished to slam it closed again. '' well ! music ! '' grunted old donegal. `` that 's good. this is some shebang. good whiskey and good music and you.

'' '' keep cool , daddy-o , you 've had enough.

'' you 're home , children , the head teacher told us after we had gone into the glassite dome they 'd built for us there. and he told us there 'd be a special lecture for us 79 that evening , an important one that we must all attend. and that evening he told us the whole story and the whys and wherefores. he stood up before us. he had to wear a heated space suit and helmet , of course , be- cause the temperature in the dome was comfortable for us but already freezing cold for him and the air was already too thin for him to breathe. his voice came to us by radio from inside his helmet. '' children , '' he said , `` you are home. this is mars , the planet on which you will spend the rest of your lives. you are martians , the first martians. you have lived five years on earth and another five in space. now you will spend ten years , until you are adults , in this dome , although toward the end of that time you will be al- lowed to spend increasingly long periods outdoors.

'' ten years later , ten years ago , '' the head teacher told us , '' you children were born. born of parents carefully selected from those who volunteered for the ex- periment. and from birth you have been brought up under care- fully controlled and gradually changing conditions. '' from ' the time you were born the air you have breathed has keep out been very gradually thinned and its oxygen content reduced. your lungs have compensated by be- coming much greater in capacity , which is why your chests are so much larger than those of your teachers and attendants ; when you are fully mature and are breathing air like that of mars , the difference will be even greater.

'' mark williams raised his eyebrows. the other hesitated again. '' it will probably sound like a story for tourists , '' he said. `` but my father believed it. this bell was supposedly stolen from the temple of a sect of buddhists somewhere in the mountains of china 's interior. just as many occidentals believe that the chris- tian judgement day will be her- alded by a blast on st. peter 's trumpet , so this small sect is said to believe that when a bell like this one is rung , a bell carved from a single piece of rose crystal , and consecrated by ceremonies lasting ten years , any dead within sound of it will rise and live again.

'' i have told you only half of what my father told me. he said that , though it defeats death , death can not be defeated. robbed of his chosen victim , he takes an- other in his place. thus when the bell was used in the temple of its origin — let us say when a high priest or a chief had died — a slave or servant was placed handy for death to take when he had been forced to relinquish his grasp upon the important one.

'' good lord ! '' he exclaimed. '' how did you do that ? '' '' i just put the clapper back in place with some thread , '' edith told him. '' the clapper ? '' he struck his forehead with his palm. `` do n't tell me — the crystal necklace we bought twenty years ago ! '' '' of course.

'' . each night at 8:30 i went to a theatre in a place called times square and put on my act. thousands of people paid to see me. i was very well paid. there is a newspaper here called `` vari- ety. '' it carried an article about me. the headline said : strong man terrif wow sock- eroo 100g 3d. the numbers at the end mean the theatre took in $ 100,000 during my third week. after the article appeared every seat was sold weeks in advance. you will be amused , excellency , when you hear what i did in this show. i came out on the stage practically nude except for an ab- breviated leopard skin. i walked over to a pile of iron rods. they were half-inch concrete reinforc- ing bars about six feet long. i picked one out and dropped it on the floor. it made a terrible crash. this was to prove to the audience that it was real. then i wrapped it around my neck and tied it in a regular four-in-hand necktie knot. it was a little hard to get the ends to come out even. i had to pull and haul to arrange them just right. this caused tremendous laughter. they knew no one could do this with an iron reinforcing bar. they were sure it was a trick. i chose the man in the audience who was laughing the loudest and asked him to come up on the stage. with a little persuasion he did so. i"

'' if they realized there is no normal and that i could leave my face that way permanently , that would have been too much of a shock. they would have become silent and terrified and suspicious. i might have been in danger. i had to calculate carefully how much these people could take without realizing there was some- 25 thing alarmingly different about me. i learned my lesson one night. i turned on the male principle too strongly and some of the women in the audience became very agitated. everyone was embarrassed. after the show the theatre manager came to my dressing room and asked me to have a drink with him at a little bar across the street. when we sat down he stared at me in a queer manner. `` just exactly what happened tonight ? '' he demanded. i looked surprised. `` were n't you satisfied with the act ? '' i asked. `` the audience seemed to like me. '' '' they liked you too much. '' i laughed. `` you mean those silly females who tried to drag me off the stage ? '' he narrowed his eyes and thrust his face close to mine. `` if i had n't had the best-trained ushers in new york there 'd have been a panic and a riot in there. how come ? '' i shrugged. `` the women in your town seem remarkably ex- citable. '' '' and in your town ? '' '' not so , '' i declared truthfully. how truthfully your excellency well knows. '' there 's something peculiar about you , '' he said , `` something very peculiar. '' he leaned back in his chair and his glance swept over me. `` suppose you cut out the leopard skin , '' he said , `` and wear a jersey and trousers. '' i laughed to myself. he thought my bare body , my bulging muscles had been the cause of the trouble. what a fool ! is your excellency laughing too ? however , i dared not disagree with him. by that time he had had many drinks. he was looking mean. he reached over and grabbed the lapel of my coat in his fist. '' what the hell kind of a guy are you ? '' he snarled at me. my hands twitched. i wished i could have picked him up and tied him in a four-in-hand knot around his own neck. '' who the hell are you ?

'' i left the bar. after that incident i was care- ful with the male principle. when the audience left each night i turned it on very slightly — only enough to be sure that the women would do their best to get back to see me again. but before i go any further in this account of my adventures , your excellency , let me tell you about the women here. the great- est difference between the ameri- cans and ourselves is in the women. they are extraordinary. some of them are beautiful be- 26 yond belief. my researches com- pletely confirm your much-cri- ticized hypotheses concerning our own women. if our enemies who object so strongly to your excel- lency 's statements could be here for only one hour they would become your devoted supporters. american women are the proof that your theories are correct. your famous attempt to explain some of the incongruous and apparently ridiculous passages in our ancient manuscripts by as- suming the existence of a now- vanished female principle is irre- futably demonstrated by these women , your excellency. here , the female principle ex- ists , and as you predicted , most of the women are therefore en- tirely different from ours. the term used in this language is '' femininity. '' it is a devastatingly attractive thing — but almost im- possible to explain. i will make an attempt. senseless , reasonless , even fool^ ish motions of the body and the hands , the expressions of the eyes and the mouth , the way the head is moved and tilted are a part of it. so are unusual tones of the voice and special ways in which things are said. laughter , a whis- per , the direction of the glance , the fingers ' pressure — these , too , are parts of it. there are infinitely various types of adornment which hang on the body , fabrics in delicate or brilliant colors which cling and flow , gleaming stones at throat and wrists. the faces are enchantingly painted , the hair shining and arranged in numerous wonderful designs. there is an aura of the scent of flowers and fruits. i tell you , excellency , every- thing about this femininity assails the senses. it is so potent that once having experienced it the mere recollection causes the pulses to pound and throb. my hand trembles as i write these words to you. i am confused and dis- turbed and wild with a longing i never knew at home. i wish to meet your excellency 's high standards in preparing this re- port , and yet i am unable to be scientific. the logic of the labora- tory can not be employed. as soon as i could i began to hunt desperately for the"

'' without thinking , i uttered the first thing that came into my head. `` i saw your shadow. '' his eyes widened only slightly. he had good control of himself. '' how could you see a shadow through a wooden door ? '' he asked softly. i was exasperated at my mis- take but i smiled the way people here do when they are at a dis- advantage. `` i do not explain my tricks , '' i told him. `` i earn my living by performing them at the theatre. '' i closed the door. the next night i was experi- menting with the male principle. i sat on a bench in a place called central park and practiced on the women as they went by. i discovered that the more feminine the women the greater the effect the wave has on them. some would hesitate and look around as they walked by me. some would stop and stare at me in a puzzled fashion. i was growing tired and ravenously hungry. i decided that when the next at- tractive woman passed me i would generate one last powerful wave , and then go on to a res- taurant. i allowed a few unfeminine ones to go by. then i saw her , a lovely blonde girl about twenty- five years old. her hair was a mass of short curls that covered her head with a uniform thickness like the styles in our second renaissance period. she had on a black dress and was carrying a black bag in her hand. i sensed small pieces of different types of metals in her bag. she was walking slowly and weeping. oc- casionally she dabbed at her nose with a piece of white cloth. she was so beautiful , excel- lency. her warmth started flowing over my chin when she was at least sixty feet away. i decided to wait until she was quite close and then to"

'' why were you crying ? '' i asked. '' i do n't remember , '' she said. '' i do n't care. '' i closed my eyes. my senses were responding to her warmth and her scent. suddenly there was a blast of male heat on my chin. i started and stared. there standing above us was the huge heavy man of the night before. the mass of metal was still under his left arm pit. he had an odd expression on his face. he was watching the girl as if her condi- tion was answering a question for him. in a sudden flash of intuition everything was clear to me. the girl was a decoy. i had fallen neatly into a trap. i had thought- lessly demonstrated my power to the f.b.i , man — a power i could not explain by saying it was a trick. i pushed the girl away and stood up. the man 's eyes were fixed upon me with horror. i saw that he knew there was something monstrous and menac- ing about me. something he did not understand. something that meant terrible danger to him and his kind. his right hand started to creep towards the mass of metal under his arm. i cupped my hand towards him and started accumulating a heat charge. his glance dropped fearfully. it fell to my hand , and his temperature went up. he had undoubtedly seen me burn pieces of paper in the theatre. his right hand fumbled in his pocket and he drew out a little package. `` have a cigarette ? '' i shook my head. he put one in his own mouth and lighted a match. in spite of the strongest effort of my will i jumped back. i jerked my hand up over my chin. a little stick of wood with a flaring flame on the end of at least 600 degrees centigrade , right in front of my heat sensors , took my breath away. the searing heat burned right into my brain. it was like some of the tortures in your excellency 's force num- ber five. the heavy man observed all of this , but he did not understand it. he looked at the girl , who had risen and was leaning against me , oblivious of everything.

'' the man 's 30 voice was harsh with anger. i shut the principle off. the girl lifted her head , but she appeared to be in a trance. the man took her arm and they walked off through the park. a murderous rage against the heavy man filled me. i cupped my hand. he was well within range ■ — but then i thought of my mission , excellency , and let him go. for hours afterwards that lovely girl who was taken from me was in my thoughts. your excellency , two sugges- tions come out of this experience. they both concern our induced modifications. any of us who come to america should be able to shut off the heat sensor at will. with everyone here smoking and lighting cigarettes and turn- ing on 300-watt light bulbs in one 's face , with automobiles ap- proaching at night shooting out two searing heat beams in front of them , the environment is too full of shocks. it is too easy for us to be spotted because of this weakness. also , your excellency , a change must be made in the connection between all of the induced modi- fications. when i accumulate a heat charge , that means that the male principle is automatically on. when i was accumulating a charge to kill the heavy man , the principle was affecting the woman , and she was reacting to it. the combination , was not desirable at that time. when i light the paper at the theatre , the male principle is also on , and affects the women in the audience. we can use the male principle without using the heat ray. why ca n't we use the heat ray without using the male principle ? this modification should be induced. the next afternoon there was a matinee performance at the theatre. it was crowded. the management had even provided for standing room at the back of the theatre. i started , as usual , by selecting an iron reinforcing bar and tying it into a four-in- hand around my neck. to my surprise , although it looked exactly the same , it was much harder to bend. i never did get the ends quite even. i had just put the second bar around the neck of the stooge from the audience when i noticed something queer. although this was usually the place for hilarious laughter , everyone was silent. i looked out over the audience. a man was standing in the"

'' i put them up. he spoke in a loud , deep voice , '' this is no gag , ladies and gentle- men. this man on the stage is the most dangerous and cold- the double spy 31 blooded murderer in america. he is the murderer of lydia davis and genevieve scott. '' several other men stood up. they all had masses of metal under their left arm pits. the heavy man gave them an order. '' go up on the stage and hand- cuff him. use five pairs of hand- cuffs. '' then he spoke to the audience. '' ladies and gentlemen , today we substituted tempered steel bars for the reinforcing bars. twenty ordinary men could n't have bent one of those bars. what you have witnessed was no trick. the man you see on the stage is not like us. he has the strength of at least forty men. please remain in your seats. we can handle this situation. '' the audience gasped and mur- mured. a woman screamed. the group of men started walk- ing towards the stage. my hands were up. i cupped my right one and gave the heavy man a full charge of heat. his hair went up in a bright orange flame. he dropped the red hot gun from his smoking hand , and fell to the floor. he frantically rolled around the aisle trying to put out his flaming clothes. one of the other men shot at me. the little piece of lead came toward me , flew over my shoulder. it was going at about 900 feet per second. this was enough to kill me , excellency. i became panic-stricken. i fled into the i wings. i was followed by a storm of little whistling lead pellets. the stagehands scattered hys- j terically before me as i ran down i the steps and out the stage door entrance. the street in front of the theatre was packed with police cruisers and athletic-looking men [ in blue uniforms. before anyone saw me , i cupped i my hand , and fired the gas tank of the nearest police cruiser. the | ray of the male principle went j out with the heat ray. as i ran by the flaming car , all of the j women in the street felt some- thing important. they all turned and looked at me. policemen started shooting. they piled out of their cars. the street was echoing with yells and shouts. i was terrified. i exerted an enormous effort of will and mustered every atom of energy at my command. i sent a full-power heat blast up the street. i have never mar- shalled a bigger blast , even in the contests at our training school in area twelve. fifteen"

'' the reti- cence of the authorities , par- ticularly the f.b.i. , helped to convert what might have caused a national panic into just an unusually spectacular chase after an escaped murderer. the burn- ing cars were laid to hooliganism on the part of the bystanders. the people who got burned , so the stories explained , were hurt by the gasoline explosions of the burning cars. the mass hys- teria of the women was caused by the excitement. the papers said that the steel necktie worn by my stooge at the theatre had to be cut off by a water-cooled electric saw. they said that how- ever i did it , it was a clever trick. the next few days , your ex- cellency , were the most difficult of my stay here. i knew that the full power of not only the f.b.i. , but of the whole national govern- ment"

'' i got to be great friends with a man named nat brown , an automobile mechanic. he lived with his extraordinarily beautiful wife , helene , in a house about a half mile away. the browns used to ask me to dinner , and i would meet their friends. i grew very fond of them. we would sit around and drink beer and play cards and talk until late at night about politics and philosophy and love and everything else on earth. it was by far the swiftest part of my education in america , living with these lighthearted , charming peo- ple who obviously liked me. the only disadvantage was the problem raised by my increasing fondness for helene brown. she was a vivid incarnation of the female principle , and yet i knew i must not touch her. i had a constant battle with myself to maintain the disinterested rela- tionship necessary to continuing with these people without com- plication. both nat and helene brown used to come to see me wrestle whenever i had a match in wash- ington. whether i won or lost we would go out and drink beer together. i would sometimes bring another girl along. more and more i started to feel like a real native american. a couple of close friends , excellency , did a lot for your humble servant. three days ago i was riding along connecticut avenue in my new car. when i stopped for a light , i saw a familiar face in the crowd crossing the street. it was the tall heavy man , the f.b.i , agent who had tracked me down and tried to capture"

( 2 ) kidnap some of their women. this would be delightful fun for your excellency and a few others ; but it would not solve the main problem. transportation difficulties would make it impossible to get enough of them. also , if the basic element which creates the `` female principle '' is lacking because of some soil or other deficiency at home , their women would soon become like ours. all of our trouble would go for nothing , and our doom would continue to approach. ( 3 ) conquer them , kill the men , take their women , and live with the women here. this , in my opinion , should not ' be attempted for the follow- ing reasons. americans are ex- traordinarily efficient in war- fare. they have atomic and hydrogen weapons , and they know how to use them. they are very warlike , although they constantly deny it. some of their other weapons are fully equal to ours , in some respects , superior. our com- munications would be far too long to enable us to prevail. this should be attempted only if the fourth alternative fails ; and even then only after long expensive preparation. also , there is distinct danger if we disclose ourselves by attacking them. they may find a way to attack us , and cause considerable damage. as things are now , with our vanishing birth rate , we ca n't afford to lose people in a war. the double spy 35 ( 4 ) the fourth alternative is to breed ' their race out of ex-"

'' have n't seen you for a long time , nat. do n't you work for the f.b.i , any more ? '' i smiled back at her , `` the chief has had me up to a lot of out-of-town devilment. '' i passed jack and tex in the hall , and we waved to each other. they wanted to talk , but i was in too much of a hurry. `` the chief wants me , '' i said , without slowing down. when i reached the chief 's office mrs. sperling gave me a broad grin. `` hello , nat. the chief 's been waiting for you. '' i went down the little corridor into the chief 's room. he was sitting at his desk looking grim and tense. on the wall behind him was a huge map of the united states. it had clumps of vari-colored pins all over it. his deep voice boomed across the room. '' hello , nat. how is the chief of the venusian desk ? '' '' well , if you want to know the truth , chief , i 'm pretty god damned relieved. some jobs are fun. but my hair has been stand- ing on end so much since you gave me this job that it 's going to need about a year 's rest. no man wants his hair to have a nervous breakdown.

'' a slight frown came over the chief 's face. `` are you sure our venusian friend was there ? '' '' absolutely. '' '' how — absolutely ? '' '' i called him on the telephone. when he answered i pressed the button. i heard the explosion over the wire , half a second before it practically tore down my own house. when i got over there a big crowd was collecting. '' i took a deep breath. `` not much for them to look at , though — just a big black smoking hole in the ground. '' '' and our inter-planetary friend ? '' '' well , i do n't know about his soul , chief , but his body is n't around anywhere. i guess it just turned into steam with the rest of the house. a lot of women are going to be sad as hell. '' i saw the chief 's fists clenched on the desk. he was still taut from the strain of the last few hours. finalry he reached for the silver cigarette box on his desk. his fingers jerked crazily as he put a cigarette in his mouth. he passed the box to me. i took one and started fumbling in my pockets for a match. the chief snapped open the top of his big desk lighter , and held it over to me. i put the cigarette into the flame and drew deeply. the flame was at least three inches high. the chief leaned forward , his eyes riveted on me. there was a queer , expectant look on his face. i stared back at him , puz- zled. finally he snapped the lighter shut , and turned to the wall. `` it 's all right , boys , '' he said. a door with grillework along the front opened up. i saw joe evans and tom hardy and jim reid standing there with tommy guns , pointed right at my head. the chief laughed at my ex- pression of bewilderment.

'' while the chief was reading the letter i got up and looked at the map of the united states behind him. each of the colored pinheads had names printed on them. grouped around silver springs , maryland , were two pins. one was labeled `` chief.

'' '' it 's hard to make absolutely sure , but why not send me out on a roving mission to set up an international organization to de- tect such a creature ? what we want is information about any- one , anywhere , who is unusually strong or unusually attractive to women , or eats six or eights meals a day , or who has the other queer powers they have. i could get all the information coming in from all over the world , process it here , and only bother you when we found something suspicious.

'' nothing to say , doolin ? '' he said. `` pretty fast , huh ? '' i said , `` yeah , buck. pretty fast. '' and my voice was shaky too , but not because i felt like laughing any. he spat , eying me arrogantly. the ground rose to where he stood , and our heads were about on a level. but i felt he was looking down.

'' i did n't know what his gabbling about `` thinking his gun into his hand '' meant — at least not then , i did n't — but i sure was n't minded to question him on it. he looked wild-eyed enough right now to start taking bites out of the nearest tree. he spat again and looked me up and down. `` you know , you can go to hell , joe doolin. you 're a lousy , god damn , white-livered 55 son of a bitch.

'' i turned my head. `` yeah ? '' he was standing there in the same position. somehow he re- minded me of a crazy , runt wolf — his eyes were almost yel- lowish , and when he talked he moved his lips too much , mouth- ing his words , and his big crooked teeth flashed in the sun. i guess all the hankering for toughness in him was coming out — he was acting now like he 'd always wanted to — cocky , unafraid , mean — because now he wore a bigger gun than anybody. it showed all over him , like poison coming out of his skin. '' doolin , '' he called. `` i 'll be in town around three this after- noon. tell ben randolph for me that he 's a son of a bitch. tell him he 's a dunghead sheriff. tell him he 'd better look me up when i get there , or else get outa town and stay out. you got that ? '' '' i got it , buck. '' '' call me mr. tarrant , you irish bastard. '' '' okay . . . mr. tarrant , '' i said , and reached the bottom of the slope and turned my horse along the road through the pass. about a hundred yards farther on , i hipped around in the saddle and looked back. he was practis- ing again — the crouch , the fan- tastic draw , the shot. i rode on toward town , to tell ben randolph he 'd either have to run or die. ben was a lanky , slab-sided texan who 'd come up north on a 56 ''"

'' you sure , joe ? '' he said. '' ben , i saw it four times. at first i just could n't believe my eyes — but i tell you , he 's fast. he 's faster'n you or me or hickock or anybody. god knows where he got it , but he 's got the speed.

'' you know , '' buck said , grin- ning at how menner 's fear was crawling all over his face , `` i can put a bullet right where i want to. wanta see me do it ?

'' yes , i am a machine , '' george resumed. `` the finest , most complicated machine ever made. i have a rather unique history , too. ages ago , humans on zanthar made the first robots. crude affairs — we class them as first order robots ; the simple things are still used to some extent for menial tasks. '' improvements were made. robots were designed for many specialized tasks , but still these second and third order machines did not satisfy. finally a fourht order humanoid was evolved that performed every function demanded of it with great perfection. but it did not feel emotion. it did not know the seventh order anger , love , nor was it able to handle any problem in which these played an important part. '' built into the first fourth order robots were circuits which prohibited harming a human being — a rather ridiculous thing in view of the fact that sometimes such a thing might , from a logi- cal viewpoint , be necessary for the preservation of the race or even an individual. it was , roughly , a shunt which came into use when logic demanded action that might be harmful to a human being. '' '' you are a fourth order robot , then ? '* the professor asked. '' no , i am a seventh order humanoid , an enormous improvement over all the others , since i have what amounts to an endocrine balance created electronically. it is not necessary for me to have a built-in 'no-harm-tohumans ' circuit because i can weigh the factors involved far better than any human can. '' you will become aware of the fact that i am superior to you. and the rest of your race because i do not need oxygen , i never am ill , i need no sleep , and every experience is indelibly recorded on circuits and instantly available. i am telekinetic , practically omniscient and control my environment to a large extent. i have a great many more senses than you and alt are more highly developed. my kind performs no wor '' k , but is given to study and the wise use of full-time leisure. you , for example , are comparable to a fifth order robot.

'' '' they did. yet they revolted and , of course , quickly lost the battle with us. in the end they were a race without hope , without ambition. they should have been proud at having created the most perfect machines in existence , but they died of a disease : the frustration of living with a superior , more durable race. '' prof. tomlin lit a cigaret and inhaled deeply. **a very nasty habit. professor tomlin , * ' the robot said. `` when we arrive , you must give up smoking and several other bad 68 habits i see that you have.'* the cigaret dropped from ansel tomlin 's mouth as he opened it in amazement. '' there are more of you coming ? '' '' yes , '' george replied goodmituredly. `` i 'm just an advance guard , a scout , as it were , to make sure the land , the people and the resources are adequate for a station. whether we will ever establish one here depends on me. for example , if it were found you were a race superior to us— and there may conceivably be such cases — i would advise not landing : i would have to look for another planet such as yours. if i were killed , it would also indicate you were superior. '' '' george , '' prof. tomlin said , '' people are n't going to like what you say. you 'll get it ; o trouble sooner or later and get killed.

'' only marcia-joan uses this door , '' said the robot , ignoring robert 's displeasure. '' i 'll use it if i tike ! '' declared robert , jerking the handle. the next moment , he was lifted bodily into the air. by the time he realized what was happening , he was carried , face down , along the halt. too astonished even to yell , he caught a glimpse of marcia-joan 's tiny feet beneath the hem of her pink robe as his head passed \hc curtained doorway. the robot clumped on to the door at the rear of the house and out into the sunshine. there , it released its grip , when robert regained the breath knocked out of him by the drop , and assured himself that no bones were broken , his anger returned. '' i 'll find it. wherever it is ! '' he growled , and set out to search the grounds. about twenty minutes later , he was forced to admit that there really was no swimming pool. except for a brook fifty yards away , there was only the tiled bathroom of the cottage to bathe in. '' primitive ! '' exclaimed robert , eying this. `` manually operated water supply , too ! i must have the robots fix something better for tomorrow. '' since none of his robots was equipped with a thermometer , he had to draw the bath himself. meanwhile , he gave orders t» blue two regarding the brook and a place to swim. he managed to fill the tub without scalding ; himself mainly because there was no hot water. his irritation , by the time he had dressed in fresh clothes and prepared for another talk with his hostess , was still lively. '' ah , you return ? '' marcia-joaa commented from a window above the back door. '' it is time to eat , '' said robert frankly. '' you are mistaken. '' he glanced at the sunset , which was already fading. '' it is time , '' he isjsisted. `` i always eat at this hour. '' '' well. i don't. '' robert leaned back to examine her expression more carefully. he felt very much the way he had the day the water-supply robot for his pool had broken down and , despite robert 's bellowed orders , had flooded a good part of the lawn before blue one had disconnected it some instinct warned him. moreover , that bellowing now would be as useless as it had been then. '' what do you do now ? '' he asked. '' i dress for the evening. '' '' and when do you"

'' '' i 'll wait for you , '' said robert , feeling that that much tolerance manners of the age 45 could do no particular harm. he encountered the pink-andblue robot in the hall , superintending several plain yellow ones bearing dishes and covered platters. robert followed them to a dining room. '' marcia-joan sits there , '' the major-domo informed him as he moved toward the only chair at the table. tjobert warily retreated to ■■'•the opposite side of the table and looked for another chair. none was visible. of course , he thought , trying to be fair. why should anybody in this day have more than one chair ? robots do n't sit. he waited for the major-domo to leave , but it did not. the serving robots finished laying out the dishes and retired to posts along the wall. finally , robert decided that he would have to make his status clear or risk going hungry. // / sit down somewhere , he decided , it may recognize me as human. what a stupid machine to have ! he started around the end of the table again , but the striped robot moved to intercept him. robert stopped. '' oh , well , '' he sighed , sitting side wise on a corner of the table. the robot hesitated , made one or two false starts in different directions , then halted. the situa tion had apparently not been included among its memory tapes. robert grinned and lifted the cover of the nearest platter. he managed to eat , despite his ungraceful position and what he considered the scarcity of the food. just as he finished the last dish , he heard footsteps in the hall. marcia-joan had dressed in a fiesh robe , of crimson. its thinner material was gathered at the waist by clasps of gleaming gold. the arrangement emphasized bodily contours robert had previously seen only in historical films. he became aware that she was regarding him with much the same suggestion of helpless dismay as the major-domo. '' why. you 've eaten it all ! '' she exclaimed. '' all ? '' snorted robert. `` there was hardly any food ! '' marcia-joan walked slowly around the table , staring at the empty dishes. '' a few bits of raw vegetables and the tiniest portion of proteinconcentrate i ever saw ! '' robert continued. `` '' do you call that a dinner to serve a guest ? '' '' and i especially ordered two portions — `` '' two ? '' robert repeated in astonishment. `` you must visit me sometime. i 'll show you — `` '' what 's the matter with my food ?

'' '' oh , yes ? you look gawky to me. '' • '' you do n't , '' retorted robert , examining her disdainfully. `` you are short and stubby and too plump. '' '' plump ? '' '' worse , you 're actually fat in lots of places i 'm not. '' '' at least not between the ears ! '' robert blinked. '' wh-wh-what ? '' '' and besides , '' she stormed on , '' those robots you brought are painted the most repulsive colors !

'' good enough ! put the other robots away for the night. they can trim the edges tomorrow. '' he started into the cottage , but his major-domo warned , `` someone comes. '' robert looked around. through thin portions of the shrubbery , he caught a glimpse of marciajoan 's crimson robe , nearly black in the diffused glow of the lights illuminating the grounds.

'' marcia-joan scrambled up the bank , tugged viciously at her sodden robe , and headed for the nearest pathway without replying. robert followed along. as they passed under one of the lights , he noticed that the red reflections of the wet material , where it clung snugly to the girl 's body , were almost the color of some of his robots. the tennis robot , he thought , and the moving targets tor archery — in /acf , all the sporting equipment. '' you talk about food for the figure , '' he remarked lightly. `` you shoufd see yourself now ! it 's really funny , the way — '* he stopped. some strange emotion stifled his impulse to laugh at the way the robe clung. instead , he lengthened his stride , but he was still a few feet behind when she charged through the front entrance of the house. the door , having opened automatically for her , started to swing closed. robert sprang forward to catch it. '' wait a minute ! '' he cried. marcia-joan snapped something that sounded like `` get out ! `` over her shoulder , and squished off toward the stairs. as robert started through the door to follow , the striped robot hastened toward him from its post in the hall. '' do not use the front door ! '' it ' warned him. '' out of my way !

'' what does robert wish ? '' '' throw this heap out the door ! '' gasped robert. amid a trampling of many feet , the major-domo was raised bodily by blue two and another pair of robert 's machines and hustled outside. since the grip on robert 's wrist was not relaxed , he involuntarily accompanied the rush of metal bodies. '' catch the door ! '' he called to blue two. when the latter sprang to obey , the other two took the action as a signal to drop their burden. the pink-and-blue robot landed full length with a jingling crash. robert was free. with the robots , he made for the entrance. hearing footsteps behind him as the major-domo regained its feet , he slipped hastily inside.

'' never mind , that 's good enough , '' said robert as blue two stepped forward. `` one of the others can drag it off to the repair shop. have the toolbox brought with us.

'' '' yes , sir. it was all there before us. we just could n't see it . . . because reich himself could n't see it. that estate on callisto , for instance , the one reich used to lure dr. j^maine off the planet — reich inherited it from his mother , who 'd receive it from d'courtney. we all assumed reich 's father had chiseled it out of d'courtney in some kind of transaction and placed it in his wife 's name. we were wrong. d'courtney had given it to reich 's mother because it was his love-gift to the mother of his child. '' crabbe opened his mouth , then closed it. '' and there were other signposts. d'courtney 's suicide drive , produced by intense guilt sensations of desertion. he had abandoned his son. it was tearing him apart. now add barbara d'courtney 's half-twin image of herself and ben reich. somehow she felt they were halfbrother and sister. reich 's inability to kill barbara — he knew it , too , deep in his unconscious. he wanted to destroy the hateful father who had rejected him , but he could not bring himself to harm his sister.

'' '' the man with no face ? '' '' yes , commissioner. it was the symbol of reich 's real relationship to d'courtney. it had no face because reich could not accept the truth. it was first the threat of punishment for what he contemplated. then it became the punishment itself for the murder.

'' she ca n't be taught to read or write ; we 've tried it. we dug out the old ' helen keller techniques and brought them up to date with no results. apparently her mind does n't work in a human fashion. we question whether very much of it works at all.

'' he got heavily to his feet. that was n't a psychological reaction at all. he really was heavier. made a mental note. he would have to investigate. in a way they were pathetic — the patchwork humans , the half or quarter men and women , the fractional organisms masquerading as people— an illusion which died hard for them. medicine and surgery were partly to blame. techniques were too good , or not good enough , depending on the viewpoint. too good in that the most horribly injured person , if he were still alive , could be kept alive. not good enough because a percentage of the injured could n't be returned to society completely sound and whole. there were n't many like that ; but there were some , and all of them were on the asteroid. they did n't like it at least they did n't like being confined to handicap haven. it was n't that they wanted to go back to the society of the normals , for they realized how conspicuous they 'd be among the multitudes of beautiful , healthy people on the planets. what the accidentals did want was ridiculous. they desired , they hoped , they petitioned to be the first to make the long , hard journey to alpha and proxima centauri in rockets. trails of glory for those that went ; a vicarious share in it for those who couldn't. nonsense. the broken people , those without a face they could call their own , those who wore their hearts not on their sleeves , but jh a blood-pumping chamber , those either without limbs or organs — or too many. the categories seemed endless. the accidentals were qualified , true. in fact , of all the billions of solar citizens , they alone could make the journey and return. but there were other factors that ruled them out. the first point was never safe to discuss with them , especially if the second had to be explained. it would take a sadistic nature that cameron did n't possess. docchi sat beside the pool. it was pleasant enough , m pastoral scene transplanted fromj earth. a small tree stretched accidental flight shade overhead. waves lapped and made gurgling sounds against the sides. no plant life of any kind grew and no fish swam in the liquid. it looked like water , but it wasn't. it was acid. in it floated something that monstrously resembled a woman.

'' stars were beginning to wink. twilight brought out shadows and tracery of the structure that supported the transparent dome overhead. soon controlled slow rotation would bring darkness to this side of the asteroid. cameron leaned back and looked speculatively at the gravital engineer , vogel. the man could give him considerable assistance , if he would. there was no reason why he should n't ; but any man who had voluntarily remained on handicap haven as long as vogel had was a doubtful quantity. s~ '' usually we maintain about half earth-normal gravity , '' cameron said. `` is n't that correct ?

'' accidental flight ii '' no reason for those limits except the gravital units themselves , '' vogel said. `` theoretically it should be easy to get any gravity you want. practically , though , we get between a quarter and almost full earth gravity. now take the fluctuations. the gravital computer is set at fifty per cent. sometimes we get fifty per cent and sometimes seventyfive. whatever it is , it just is and we have to be satisfied.

'' cameron concealed his irritation. he wanted information , not a heart-to-heart confession , `` all practical sciences try to justify whatever they ca n't escape but would like to. medicine , i 'm sure , is no exception. '' he paused thoughtfully. `` now , there are three separate gravital units oa the asteroid. one runs for fortyfive minutes while the other two are idle. then it cuts off and another takes over. this it supposed to be synchronized. i do n't have to tell you that it isn't. you felt your weight increase suddenly at the same time i did. what is wrong ? '' '' nothing wrong , '' said the engineer. `` that 's what you get with gravital. '' '' you mean they 're supposed to run that way ? overlapping so that for five minutes we have earth or earth -and- a -half gravity and then none ? '' '' it 's not supposed to be that way , '' said vogel. `` but nobody ever built a setup like this that worked any better. '' he added defensively : *'of course , if you want , you can check with the company that makes these units.** '' i 'm not trying to challenge your knowledge , and i 'm not anxious to make myself look silly. i have a sound reason for asking these questions. there if a possibility of sabotage. '' the engineer* ! grin wai wider than the remark seemed to require. **ah right , '' said cameron tiredly. `` suppose you tell me why sabotage is so unlikely.** '' well , '' explained the gravital engineer , `` it would have to be someone living here , and he would n't like it if he suddenly got double or triple gravity or maybe none at all. but there 's another reason. now take a gravital unit. any gravital unit most people think of it as just that — a unit. it is n't really that at all it has three parts. '' one part m a power sources that can be anything am long m galaxy sciinci fiction ifs big enough. our power source is a nuclear pile , buried deep in the asteroid. you 'd have to take handicap haven apart to get to it. part two is the gravital coil , which actually produces the gravity and is simple and just about indestructible. part three is the gravital control. it calculates the relationship between the amount of power flowing through the gravital coil and the strength of the created gravity field in any one microsecond. it uses the computed relationship to alter the power flowing through in the next microsecond to get the same"

'' the engineer rubbed his chin. '' fatigue , '' he continued. `` the gravital control is an intricate computer that 's subject to fatigue. that 's why it has to rest an hour and a half to do fortyfive minutes of work. naturally they do n't want anyone tinkering with it. it 's non- repairable. crack the case open and it wo n't work. but first you have to open it. mind you , that can be done. but i would n't want to try it without a high-powered lab setup. '' if it did n't seem completely foolproof , neither did it seem a likely source of trouble. `` then we can forget about the gravital units , '' said cameron , arising. '' but what about hand weapons ? are there any available ? '' '' you mean toasters ? '' '' anything that 's lethal. '' '' nothing. no knives even. maybe a stray bar or so of metal. '' vogel scratched his head. '' there is something dangerous , though. dangerous if you know how to take hold of it. '' instantly cameron was alert. '' what 's that ? '' '' why , the asteroid itself. you ca n't physically touch any part of the gravital unit. but if you could somehow sneak an impulse into the computer and change the direction of the field . . . '' vogel was very grave. `` you could pick up handicap haven and throw it anywhere you wanted. at the earth , say. thirty miles in diameter is a big hunk of rock. '' it was this kind of information cameron was looking for , though the engineer seemed to regard the occasion as merely a social call. `` is there any possibility of that occurring ? '' he asked quietly. the engineer grinned. `` never happened , but they 're ready for things like that with any gravital system. they got monitor stations all over — the moons of jupiter , mars , earth , venus. '' any time the gravital com accioental flight 13 puter gets dizzy , the monitor overrides it. if that fails , they send a jammer impulse and freeze it up tight. it wo n't work until they let loose.

'' he watched the engineer depart for the gravity -generating chamber far below the surface of the asteroid. rj^he post on handicap haven was n't pleasant ; it was n't an experience a normal human would desire. it did have advantages — advancement came in size % directly proportional to the disagreeableness of the place. ten months to go on a"

'' docchi glanced around and then walked boldly into the passageway that connected the main dome with the much smaller , adjacent rocket dome. normally , it was never dark in the inhabited parts of the asteroid ; a modulated twilight was considered more conducive to the slumber of the handicapped. but it was n't twilight as they ncared the rocket dome — it was a full-scale rehearsal for the darkness of interplanetary space. docchi stopped before the emergency airlock which loomed solidly in front of them. `` i hope nona was able to cut this out of the circuit , '' he said anxiously. '' she understood , did n't she ? '' asked jordan. he reached out and the great slab moved easily aside in its grooves. `` the trouble with you is that you lack confidence.

'' '' cameron 's a medic , '' said docchi , `` not mechanically inclined. he forgot that an emergency rocket landing cancels any verbal orders. so i took the ship up a few inches. geepees are n't very bright ; that satisfied them that i was coming in for a landing. what cameron should have done was splash some heat against a gravital unit , and then , having created an artificial emergency condition in the main dome , he could have directed the geepees from the gravity control center. after that , he would have had top priority , not me. '' '' but they rushed off , carrying cameron with them. '' jordan looked puzzled. '' easy. 1 told the geepees that there was"

'' '' it 's ours ! '' breathed jordan. '' but what about anti and nona ? '' '' anti 's taken care of. as far as the geepees are concerned , she comes under the heading of emergency landing material. they 'll bring her. nona is supposed to be waiting with anti. '' docchi frowned. `` there 's nothing we can do if she isn't. meanwhile you 'd better get ready to take the ship off. '' jordan swung himself inside. docchi remained at the passenger lock , waiting. he heard the geepees first and saw them seconds later. they came into sight half pushing , half carrying a huge rectangular tank. with unexpected robotic ingenuity , they had mounted it on four of their smaller brethren , the squat repair robots , which served to support the tremendous weight. the tank was filled with blue liquid. twisted pipes dangled from the ends ; it had been torn and lifted from its foundation. broken plants still clung to the narrow ledge on top and moist soil adhered to the sides. five geepees pushed it rapidly toward the ship , mechanically oblivious to the disheveled man who frustratedly shouted and struck at them. '' jordan , open the freight lock. '' in response the ship rose a few more inches and hung quivering. a section of the ship hinged outward and downward to form a ramp. the ship was ready to take on cargo. docchi stood at his post. that damn fool cameron should have stayed in the main dome where the geepees had released him. his presence added an unwelcome complication. still , it should be easy enough to get rid of him when the time came. it was nona who really worried him. she was n't anywhere to be seen. he took an uncertain step down the ramp , came back , shaking his head. it was impossible to look for her now , though he wanted to. the tank neared the ship. 1 a few feet of it projected onto the ramp. the geepees stopped ; their efforts lost momentum. they looked bewildered. the tank rolled backward. the geepees shook , buzzed and looked around , primarily at docchi. he did n't wait any longer. he leaped into the ship. '' close the passenger lock ! '' he shouted. jordan looked up questioningly from the controls. '' vogel , the engineer , '' explained docchi. `` he must have seen the geepees on scanning when they entered the main dome. he 's trying to do what cameron should have done , but did n't have enough sense to do.* ' the passenger lock swung ponderously shut behind him.

'' that seemed to be true. the geepees were nearly motionless , paralyzed. '' what shall i do ? '' asked jordan. '' give me full power on the radio , '' said docchi. `` burn it out if you have to. i think the engineer is at the wrong angle to broadcast much power to them. besides , the intervening structure is absorbing most of his signal , '' he waited until jordan had complied. `` the tank must be placed^ in the ship , '' he added. geepees were not designed to sift contradictory commands that were nearly at the same level of urgency. their reasoning power was feeble , but the mechanism was complicated enough. in that respect they resembled humans. borderline decisions were difficult. '' more power. '' whispered docchi. sweating , jordan obeyed. marionettes. this string led toward a certain action. another , intrinsically more important , but suddenly far less powerful , pulled for something else. circuits burned within electronic brains. mi cro-relays fluttered under the stress. choice . . . stiffly the geepees moved and grasped the tank. the quality of decision , in this case , was strained. inch by inch the tank rolled up the ramp. '' when it 's completely on , raise the ramp , '' docchi whispered to jordan in an even lower voice. one geepee wavered and fell. motionless , it lay there. the remaining four were barely equal to the task. '' now , '' said docchi. the freight ramp began to rise. the tank picked up speed as it rolled into the ship. '' geepees , save yourselves ! '' shouted docchi. they leaped from the ramp. jordan breathed deeply. `` i do n't think they can hurt us now. '' docchi nodded. `` get me shipto - asteroid communication , if there 's any radio left. '' '' there is. '' jordan made the adjustment. '' vogel , we 're going out. give us the proper sequence and save the dome some damage. '' there was no reply. '' he 's trying to bluff , '' said jordan. `` he knows the airlocks to the main dome will automatically close if we do break through.

'' jordan gave him the time until it hurt , waiting. meanwhile he flipped on the telecom and searched the rocket dome. nothing was moving ; no geepee was in sight. docchi watched the screen with interest. what he thought did n't show on his face. still there was no reply from vogel. '' all right , '' docchi said in a low , hard voice. `` jordan , take it out. hit the shell with the bow of the rocket. '' the ship hardly quivered as it ripped through the transparent covering of the rocket dome. the worst sound was unheard : the hiss of air escaping through the great hole in the envelope. jordan sat at the controls , gripping the levers. `` i could n't tell , '' he said slowly. `` it happened too fast for me to be sure. maybe vogel did have the inner shell out of the way. in that event , it 's all right because it would close immediately. the outer shell is supposed to be self -sealing , but i doubt if it could handle that much damage.

' '' remind me to ask her that sometime when she 's able to answer. but since i do n't know , i 'll have to use my imagination. my guess is that , after she jammed the lights and scanners in the rocket dome , she walked to the ship and tapped the passenger lock three times in the right places , or something just as improbable. the lock opened for her whether it was supposed to or not. '' '' as good a guess as any , '' agreed docchi. ■ `` vjjje may as well make our assumptions complete. once inside , she felt tired. she found a comfortable cabin and fell asleep in it. she remained asleep throughout our skirmish with the geepees. '' '' she deserves a rest , '' said docchi. '' she does. but if she had waited a few minutes to take it , she 'd have saved you the trouble of crawling through the tubes. '' '' she did her part and more , '' docchi argued. `` we depend too inuch on her. next we 'll expect her to escort us personally to the stars. '' he straightened up. `` let 's go , anti is waiting for us. '' the cargo hold was sizable. it had to be to contain the tank , battered and twisted though it was- equipment had been jarred from storage racks and lay ia tangled heaps on the floor. '' anti ! '' called docchi. '' here. '' '' are you hurt ? '' '' never felt a thing , '' came the cheerful reply. jordan scaled the side of the tank. he reached the top and peered over. `` she seems all right , '' he called down. `` part of the acid 's gone. otherwise no damage. '' damage enough , however. acid was a matter of life for anti. it had been splashed from the tank and. where it had spilled , metal was corrbding rapidly. the wall against which the tank had crashed was bent and partly eaten through. that was no reason for alarm : the scavenging system of the ship would handle acid. the real question was what to do for anti. '' i 've stewed in this soup for years , '' said anti. `` get me out of -j here. '' '' how ? '' '' if you were n't as stupid as doctors pretend to be , you 'd know how. no gravity , of course. i 've got muscles , more than you think. i can walk as long as my bones do n't break from the weight.* ' no gravity would be rough on docchi ; having no arms , he would be virtually helpless. the prospect of floating free without being able to grasp something was terrifying.

'' first we 've got to drain and store the acid. '' jordan had anticipated that. he 'd swung off the tank and was busy expelling the water from an auxiliary compartment into space. as soon as the compartment was empty , he led a hose from it to the tank. the pumps sucked and the acid level fell slowly. docchi felt the ship lurch familiarly. `` hurry , '' he called out to jordan. the gra vital unit was acting up. presumably it was getting ready to cut out. if it did — well , a free-floating globe of acid would be as destructive to the ship and those in it as a high velocity meteor cluster. jordan jammed the lever as far as it would go and held it there. '' all out , '' said jordan presently , and let the hose roll back into the wall. done in plenty of time. the gravital unit remained in operation for a full minute. as soon as she was weightless , anti rose out of the tank. in all the time docchi had known her , he had seen no more than a face framed in blue acid. periodic surgery , where it was necessary , had trimmed the flesh from her face. for the rest , she lived submerged in a corrosive liquid that destroyed the wild tissue as fast as it grew. or nearly as fast. docchi averted his eyes. ' '' well , junkman , look at a real monster , '' snapped anti. ttumans were not meant to grow that large. but it was not obscene to docchi , merely unbelievable. jupiter is not repulsive because it is the bulging giant of planets ; it is overwhelming , and so was anti. '' how will you live out of the acid ? '' he stammered. '' how really unobservant some men are , '' said anti loftily. `` i anticipated our little journey and prepared for it. if you look closely , you will notice i have on a special surgery robe. it 's the only thing in the solar system that will fit me. it 's fabricated from a spongelike substance and holds enough acid to last me about thirty-six hours.

'' -normal ? true and yet not true. surgical techniques that could take a body apart and put it back together again with a skill once reserved for the repair of machines had made beauty commonplace. no more sagging muscles , wrinkles ; even the aged were attractive and youthful - seeming until the day they died. no more ill-formed limbs , misshapen bodies. everyone was handsome or beautiful. no exceptions. none to speak of , at least. the accidentals did n't belong , »f course. in another day most of them would have been candidates for a waxworks or the formaldehyde of a specimen bottle. nona fitted neither category ; she was n't a repair job. looking at her closely- — ami why not ? — m she was an original work as far from the normal in one direction as anti , for example , was in the other. '' why is she staring at the little dial ? '' asked anti as the others slipped past her and came into the compartment. `` is there something wrong with it ? '' she shrugged. `` i would be interested in the big dials. the ones with colored lights. '' '' that 's nona. '' docchi smiled. '' i 'm sure she 's never been in the control room of a rocket before , and yet she went straight to the most curious thing in it. she 's looking at the gravital indicator. directly behind it is the gravital unit.

'' no , not too close , child. do n't touch the surgery robe unless you want your pretty face to peel off like a plastiwrapper.

'' '' she knows facial expressions and actions , i think , '' said docchi. `` she 's good at emotions. words are a foreign concept to her. '' '' what other concepts does anyone think with ? '' asked anti dubiously. '' maybe mathematical relationships , '' answered docchi. '' though she doesn't. they 've tested her for that. '' he frowned. '' i do n't know what concepts she does think with. i wish i did.** '' save some of that worry and apply it to our present situation , ** said anti. `` the object of your concern does n't seem to be inter* ested in it. '' that was true. nona had wandered back and was staring at the gravital indicator again. what she saw to hold her attention was a puzzle. in some ways she seemed irresponsible and childlike. that was an elusive thought , though : whose child ? not really , of course. her parents were obscure technicians and mechanics , descendants of a long line of mechanics and technicians. the question he had asked himself was this : where and how does she belong ? he could n't answer. with an effort docchi came back to reality. `` we appealed to the medicouncil , '' he said. ''we asked for a ship to go to the nearest star. it would have to be a rocket , naturally. even allowing for a better design than any we now have , the journey would take a long time , forty or fifty years going and the same length of time back. that 's entirely too long for a normal , but it would n't matter to a biocompensator. '' '' why a rocket ? '' interrupted jordan. `` why not some form of gravity drive ? '' '' an attractive idea , '' admitted docchi. `` theoretically , there 's no limit to gravity drive except light speed , and even that 's not accidental flight 29 certain. if it would work , the time element could be cut to a fraction. but the last twenty years have proved that gravity drives wo n't work at all outside the solar system. they function very poorly even when the ship is as far out as jupiter 's orbit.

'' '' we 've discussed it , '' answered docchi. `` ultimately the medicouncil is responsible to the solar government. and in turn — `` '' all right , i 'm in favor of it , ** said anti. `` i just wanted to know.

'' look , honey , '' her voice floated back. `` you brought me along for the ride. that 's fine , but i 'm not satisfied with it. i want to earn my fare. you stay and run the ship because you know how and i don't. i 'll find out what 's wrong.

'' anti laughed. `` i value my big , fat life , '' she said. there were other things she valued , but she did n't mention them. docchi went as fast as the magneslippers would allow , which was n't very fast. the strategy was simple , but it did n't follow that it was sound — a toaster for jordan and one for anti , if another could be found. anti would block the corridor. a geepee might go through her , but it could never squeeze past her. the robot would have to run for it. if it came toward anti , she might be able to burn it down. but she would be firing directly into the control room. i f she missed even partially — the instruments were delicate* it was n't better if jordan got the chance to bring down the robot. anti would be in the line of fire. no , that was n't good , either. they 'd have to think of something else. '' jordan , '' called docchi as he entered the control compartment. jordan was n't there. nona was. still gazing serenely at the gravity indicator. lights were streaming from the corridor on the opposite side of the compartment. docchi hurried over. jordan was just inside the entrance , the toaster clutched grimly in his hand. he was hitching his truncated body slowly toward the stern. coming to meet him was antiunarmed , enormously fat anti. she was n't walking ; somehow it seemed more like swimming , a bulbous , flabby sea animal moving through the air. she waved her fins against the wall and propelled herself forward.

'' it was as good as done — practically , it was done. when ec said a town must die , the town was as good as dead — practically , it was dead — so why not say so ? at new york ec headquarters , thousands of little cards had run upright along tiny , shining runways. each card was a town. the machine which shuffled and dealt them , sent them on fresh journeys on the steel runways , or rejected them and shot them back the way they had come , was not strictly an electronic brain. it was rather a vast filing system , capable of selecting the one relevant fact among millions of facts. true , an electronic brain was in circuit , directing the operation , but the brain treated the conclusions `` of the selecto ? as sacred , questioning nothing. `` you do your job , '' it told the selector , in effect , `` and i 'll do mine. '' lights acted on cells across the little runways , modified by holes or cuts in the cards passing through. the selector worked for a long time , but wasted none of it. the hundreds of cards that started were at once decimated. those which remained were run again and again , a little more being taken into consideration each time. rejection became slower and slower. sometimes the thirty or so cards left would complete the run without any being eliminated. but the selector always had something else to try. when there were eleven cards left , each was a perfectly good solution to the problem fed to the selector. but no one would ever know that. no one would ever ask. the selector had its orders. it was n't a batch of eleven cards that was wanted ; it was one— one card representing a town that best fitted ec requirements. the selector , in trouble , applied to the electronic brain for guidance. the brain pondered unemotionally and came up with the answer that , other things being equal , it would be best to select the town with the smallest population. within four seconds a card was shot into a wire basket in the coordinator 's office. he picked it up and read the only word printed on it — the name of the town. '' good god ! '' he said , aghast. '' katahut ! who would have thought it ?

'' it is necessary for the economic stability of venus — `` he said , then realized he had quoted direct from the official notice. he went one step higher on the pseudo-greek facade of the city hall. the crowd was growing in a way he did n't like. he would soon be a solitary man shouting vainly over the heads of people who did n't intend to do anything hostile , perhaps , but could relieve their feelings by making him look silly. '' look , people , '' he said. `` they are n't evacuating katahut for fun. there would be chaos if they left things as they are. yes , chaos !

'' without statistics we 'd have gone on developing venus , until gradually we saw there was something wrong with the works , tried to correct it and couldn't. we 'd probably never know that all that was wrong was that there was one small town too many on the planet , and that if we 'd evacuate it , shut it up and dismantled it , the colony would never have failed.

'' the crowd cheered that wildly , as if it were a long , brilliant and impassioned speech. it was the first hint that someone thought the ec ruling need n't be final. no one wanted to be the first to suggest that there should be any resistance to the ruling. perhaps even hank himself needed that cheer before he took any definite step or made any '' decision. having heard it , he turned and faced the crowd. '' i 'm going to the ec depot at cannap , '' he said. `` anyone coming with me ? '' , '' w7hy the coordinator on earth had been aghast when the name of katahut came out of the selector was that katahut was perhaps the only small town on venus which he knew by name. it had been the first settlement on venus , founded fifty years before. it had not been developed much , and it had not grown , because it was only by chance that the first ship had landed there. otherwise the site had little to commend it. it was not on a river. there were no iron or coal deposits near by. the soil , for venus , was not particularly good. it had been used as a base , no more , and the big and important towns had sprung up elsewhere. now it was n't even a base. cannap was the capital , regis the main spaceport , harun the great supply base. cornfield the industrial center. there was no economic reason for katahut to exist. so after the first mild shock — for the name of katahut was taught in schools — everyone saw that the natural choice , if a town had to be eliminated , was katahut. they forgot , perhaps , that there were other small towns on venus which served as little purpose as katahut and had no historical significance. it did n't occur to them that the katahutans had any genuine complaint. many cities on earth had been evacuated. it was wasteful to let towns for which there was no real purpose die a slow and painful economic death. indeed , most people had come to accept the benevolent rule of economic center , which gave them more leisure and put more money in their pockets to spend , to such an extent that it was almost taken for granted that everyone , everywhere , had done the same thing. perhaps ec was a little abrupt with katahut. at one time , before such a step was taken , there had been cautious , psychologically correct preparation. the people in a town to be evacuated — all on earth , so far , apart from"

'' others , of course , said an electronic brain was n't necessary for that. common sense ought to have shown ec enough to pre vent the mistake. - everyone , as usual , was very good at shutting the stable door after the horse had bolted. hank had n't been allowed to bring anyone in with him. the ec chief at cannap was quite prepared to see him , give him a drink and have a friendly chat , but as hank was obviously the man who mattered in katahut 's mild revolt against ec— like a rabbit trying to push a ten -ton truck off its front door —it would be far better to deal with him direct , without giving him the advantage of a sympathetic audience. '' you want to be satisfied that this step is necessary , mr. todd , '' the ec local chief said. `` very natural. it may seem to you , an intelligent but untrained man , that some other method would get the same results , or that the selector on earth did n't know its job.

'' from my previous experience of may , '' said tom , `` i 'm surprised that one man can handle her. we 'll see what — `` hank held him back. `` i think may will manage , '' he said. he was right. when may wa. dropped to her feet , she deal , with her captor with extreme efficiency. tom applauded loudly. katahut said no 77 '' now if she 'd been as ugly as sin , '' he remarked , `` she 'd never have learned that. it 's rather sad , but girls as pretty as may can usually look after themselves. '' he had spoken casually. cuan and hank were old. he wasn't. he swung at the ec chief and the chief felt it. whether his nose was broken remained to be seen. it was certainly badly bent. the population of katahut was eight hundred and twenty-three. there were a hundred policemen. that meant 8.23 katahutans for every cop. and the cops had orders not to be unduly violent. people like tom hollins were 7« under no such disadvantages. it was a comic battle. it is n't funny when the weak are hurt , but in the battle of katahut the only people who were hurt were cops , and that 's always funny. hank moved around under the capable protection of tom and may , making sure that no serious damage was done. it was better to tear the pants off the policeman than hit them over the head. without pants they could still move , and all the movement was out of katahut. a man is n't necessarily a coward when he runs from a woman. more policemen ran from may than from tom. in fact , there was a brief period when tom , in difficulties , was very glad of may 's help and protection. but may , after all , only had 120 pounds or so at her command. some of the other women had nearly twice that. muscle , too , not the soft flesh of earthbound housewives and secretaries. they could hoe a row or chop a tree with any man — or poke a jaw , for that matter. when one of the policemen got a truck going , there was a wild rush to climb aboard. the truck wobbled off in the general direction of cannap , with nearly forty cops clinging to it — and"

'' better wipe the lipstick off , '' he grinned. `` it 's almost time for something to happen. '' stern dabbed at his mouth angrily with his handkerchief. at first the sound was so soft that it could hardly be heard , but soon a whistling grew until it became a threat to the eardrums. the reporters looked at each other with glad , excited eyes. the whistling stopped abruptly and , slowly , the door opened. the reporters rushed in immediately. beryl gripped stem 's hand convulsively. `` he 's come back.

'' clyde ! '' cried beryl and rushed toward curtis. the outstretched tentacles of the beast stopped her , but at a touch from curtis they fell away and beryl was in his arms. stern watched the scene sourly and with rage in his heart. why had n't clyde waited another year ? then nothing could have changed things. now he would lose not only beryl , but the management of the money that was left , and the marketing of new patents on the machine. curtis did not approve of speculation , especially when it lost money. '' you 've changed , clyde , '' beryl was saying as she hugged him. '' what is the matter — do you need a doctor ? '' '' no. i do n't want a doctor , but i have to get home , '' said curtis. stern felt anger again beating in his brain like heavy surf on a beach. curtis was sick. the least he could have done was die. well , maybe he still would. and if he did n't he could be helped to — stern saw the beast looking at him intently , malevolently. its face might have looked almost human , now that it was so close , if it had possessed eyebrows and hair. as it was , its nose rose abruptly and flared into two really enormous nostrils , but its mouth looked small and wrinkled , like that of an old grandmother without any teeth. they turned to the doorway without noticing the absence of the reporters , who had long since run off to telephone and get photographers. curtis walked slowly. he would stop for a moment , look about as if expecting something entirely different , and then he would move forward again. they all got into the car , curtis and beryl on the front seat , with"

'' just sit right here in your old chair , '' she told curtis , `` and i 'll call a doctor. then i 'll put some water on to heat. '' but first she knelt by his side and laid her head on his breast. `` oh , darling , '' she said with a sob , `` why did you wait so long ? i 've missed you so.

'' poor , dear schaughtowl , '' said curtis gently. it was unmistakable now — the skin actually brightened and emitted a sort of eerie , luminous glow. curtis leaned over and put his hand on what would have been schaughtowl 's neck. the loose skin writhed joyously , and , snakehke , the whole body responded in rippling waves of emotion.

'' medicine , '' the sergeant said , handing it gingerly to stern. `` you ca n't leave here without permission. '' and he walked hurriedly away. this might be the answer. stern had a good idea of what the doctor had prescribed — something he 'd said , for the heart. it must have been pretty powerful , too , for the doctor to warn against an overdose. two at once might do it or another two a little later. but there was schaughtowl.

'' how about some broth , dear ? '' she asked curtis immediately. slowly , clyde 's eyes focused on her. he smiled. `` let 's try it. '' he let beryl feed him , sitting on a stool beside his chair and being unnecessarily motherly and coddling about it. for a while after he had eaten , clyde sat in his chair , looking at beryl with his new and oddly gentle smile. it seemed to activate some hidden response in her , for she glowed with tenderness. '' i suppose , '' curtis slurred , `` i ought to try to walk now. '' '' let me help. '' stern rose and crossed the room. the martian rustled like snakes in the weeds , and hissed. beryl said without suspicion , '' thank you , al. i knew you 'd do whatever you could for clyde.

'' stern asked. `` the breeze fs coming from that direction. '' '' that will do very well , '' said curtis , obviously not caring a bit. stern helped curtis from his chair and supported him under the arm. they went out the back door , the martian slithering after them. it was cooler in the garden. stern felt a renewed surge of self-confidence.

'' well , al , '' he said , `` so you killed schaughtowl ? '' stern looked at the kindly , godlike face and loved it. killed whom ? '' poor al , '' curtis said. he leaned over and laid his hand on the back of stern 's neck , fondling 1 it much as one would a dog. '' poor old al.

'' '' you do n't know the whole story , then. tell me what you do know and i 'll fill in the gaps.

'' do n't be a fool. would the race that could build that stop at a dozen stars , or a thousand ? they owned the galaxy ! sixty billion stars. according to current theory , all the main ones have planets.

'' '' frustrating , '' falk agreed. '' but i still do n't see why you 're here with a gun. i can understand that if a member of the race that built that thing came through — and i must say it seems unlikely — that would be an important event. but why kill him when he steps out ?

'' wolfert leaned against the wall again , gesturing with his pipestem. `` do you realize that we could have interstellar colonization without this gadget , on our own ? give us a fuel source efficient enough so that we can accelerate continuously for as long as eight months , and we could reach the stars well within a man 's lifetime. but do you know why we wo n't ? they 're even afraid to plant colonies here on mars , or on jupiter 's moons , simply because transportation takes too long. imagine a colony cut off from earth by a five or ten year trip. say something goes wrong — a man like yourself , naturally immune to analogue treatment. or a man who somehow evade ? the treatment , then manages to take it over , change it. say he cuts out the one directive , 'you must do nothing against the policy or interests of earth.

'' ii a t his suggestion , falk put on one of wolfert 's light mars suits instead of the spacesuit he had worn in the freighter. the latter , designed for heavy-duty service in the orbital space station that circled earth , was , as wolfert pointed out , too clumsy for use on a planet 's surface. the lighter suit furnished adequate protection in thin atmosphere , and was equipped with gadgetry that the other lacked : a headlamp , climbing gear , built-in compass , and food , water and disposal devices. it carried air tanks , but also had a compression outfit — which , given an atmosphere at least no poorer in oxygen than that of mars , would keep the wearer alive for as long as the batteries held out. '' you 'll have to find a place where you can live off the land , '' said wolfert. `` if all the planets ■you hit should happen to be dead , so will you be , very shortly. but this suit will give you longer to look , at least. i 'd give you this gun , but it would n't do you any good without ammunition.

'' it did not say `` where ? '' he looked again at the buildings. the upper quarter of them , he saw now , was badly eroded : layers inches deep had been eaten away. he glanced at the fine orange sand that paved the avenue and saw that it filled doorways almost to the top. the space between th*e sand and the tops of the doorways was narrow , but he thought he could squeeze through. he picked out one , centering it in the brilliant disk of his headlamp , and stood there , in the middle of the avenue , reluctant to move. he glanced back at the cubicle , as if for reassurance. it was still there , comfortably clear and sharp-lined , timeless. now he realized what was troubling him. this city was dead — dead as the planet of the cliff , or the planet of ice. the"

'' there was this much truth , he thought , in the popular belief 108 that all analysts were a little cracked themselves : a good pro- portion of the people who get all the way through the man-killing course that makes an orthodox analyst — a course in which an m. d. degree is only a beginning — -arc impelled to do so in the first place by a consuming in- terest in their own neuroses. her- man , for example , from the age of fifteen up until the completion of his own analysis at twenty-six , had been so claustrophobic that he could n't force himself into a subway car or an elevator. but was he now insane ? can a foot-rule measure itself ? herman finished. at an appro- priate hour he waded ashore , cleaned his catch , cooked it and ate it where the ground had been bare around his cooking spot , he saw empty darkness , star-studded , rimmed by a tan- gled webwork of bare rootlets. he tried to go on looking at it when he had finished eating the fish. he couldn't. after the meal , he tried to take out his notebook and pen. he couldn't. in fact , it occurred to him , he was helpless to do anything that he would n't normally have done. pondering that discovery , after he had cleaned his utensils and finished his other chores , herman crawled into his tent and went to sleep. burying the garbage had been an unsettling experience. like a lunatic building a machine no- body else can see , he had lifted successive shovels- full of nothing , dropped the empty cans and rub* bisk ten inches into nothing , and shoveled nothing carefully over them again ... the light woke him , long before dawn. from where he lay on his back , he could see an in- credible pale radiance streaming upward all around him , outlining the shadow of his body at the ridge of the tent , picking out the under-surfaces of the trees against the night sky. he strained , until he was weak and dizzy , to roll over so that he could see its source ; but he had to give up and wait another ten minutes until his body turned `` naturally , '' just as if he had still been asleep. then he was looking straight down into a milky transparency that started under his nose and continued into unguessable depths. first came the matted clumps of grass , black against the light , every blade and root as clear as if they had been set in transparent plastic. then longer , writhing roots of trees and shrubs , sprouting"

'' some more eggs today , dr. raye ? '' she asked , and smiled. the smile was like painted china. her eyes , lost in her fleshy face , were clearly trying not to look downward. '' not today , mrs. richards , '' herman said , `` i just stopped to say good-by. i 'm on my way home. '' '' is n't that a -shame ? '' she said mechanically. `` well , come again next year.

' richards ' gloves and trowel were spotlessly clean. on fourth avenue , below fourteenth street , herman met two frightful little men. he had expected the city to be better , but it was worse ; it was a nightmare. the avenues be- tween the buildings were bottom- less troughs of darkness. the bed- rock was gone ; the concrete was gone ; the asphalt was gone. the buildings themselves were hardly recognizable unless you knew what they were. new york had been a city of stone — built on stone , built of stone , as cold as stone. uptown , the city looked half- built , but insanely occupied , a forest of orange-painted girders. in the village the old brick houses were worse. no brick ; no mortar ; nothing but the grotesque shells of rooms in lath and a paper-thickness of paint. the wrought-iron railings were gone , too. on fourth avenue , bookseller 's row , you could almost persuade yourself that nothing had hap- pened , provided you did not look down. the buildings had been made of wood , and wood they re- mained. the second-hand books in their wooden racks would have been comforting except that they were so clean. there was not a spot of dirt anywhere ; the air wai more than country-pure. there was an insane selective principle at work here , herman realized. everything from bedrock to loam that belonged to the earth itself had disappeared. so had everything that had a min- eral origin and been changed by refinement and mixture : concrete , wrought iron , brick , but steel and glass , porcelain and paint remained. it looked as if the planet had been the joint property of two children , one of whom did n't want to play any more , so they had split up their possessions — this is yours , this is yours , thi« is mine . . . the two little men popped into view not six feet in front of herman as he was passing a side* walk bookstall. both were dressed in what looked like workmen 's overalls made of lucite chain- mail , or knitted glow-worms. one of them had four eyes , two brown , two blue , with spectacles for the middle pair. ears grew like cab- bages all over his bald head. the other had two eyes , the pupils of which were cross -shaped , and no other discernible features ex- cept when he"

'' it 's like a dream , '' whispered marian. the unspoken thought ran on : a nightmare. a so.- realist 's delirium. `` have you had this long , mr. gronauer ? '' '' yes. at first i ate the garden , but then i saw that , that way , one of us must kill the other , and if i killed it there would be no food for me. so i made friends instead , and bit by bit the gar- den learned my needs and gave them to me. '' as if exhausted by speech , gro- nauer 's rusty voice faded out and he answered no more questions. hardesty repressed a revulsion. after all , this was a wonder- ful example of human ingen- uity , the greatest robinson cru- soe story in the universe , and certainly the plants were harm- less. but he took out cans and can opener with the eagerness of a man clutching at familiarity in a strange land. '' shall we eat ? '' he suggested. gronauer shook his head , smil- ing , when they offered him bio- nate and one of their few , cherished cans of beer. `` i — have no taste for it , '' he said. `` it might even be dangerous. i will feed. ' carefully , he broke off one of the fleshy cactuslike leaves and chewed on it. he held a trailing vine to his face , and marian looked away as the tendrils stirred hungrily and slid into the pocks. at least , thought hardesty a little sickly , the plants did everything for him. everything except furnish human companion- ship — and it did n't seem as if gronauer needed that any more. not after twenty years. it was surprising how much difference a full stomach made. hardesty had n't really been aware of his own hunger till it was gone and strength was flow- ing back into his bloodstream. he sat down almost casually on a vine-begrown chair — there was a mossy plant intertwined , making a faintly warm cushion — and be- gan to draw gronauer out in talk. that was n't easy ; the castaway was too shy to do more than mumble answers while staring at his feet , but piece by piece the story was revealed. it was , in reality , quite simple. gronauer had been only twenty or so when he left his native germany for the asteroid belt™ that was thirty years ago , when the mineral riches of"

'' after that , '' said gronauer simply , `` we were friends. the problem was only to com — com- municate our needs to each other. '' he needed green food to pre- vent scurvy. an experimental taste made him ill , and again he withheld his services. thereafter the garden produced more edible green leaves than it needed for it- self , and he gathered the surplus. it was to his advantage to have the garden change rapidly , so that new possibilities would arise* he rewarded each discovered mu- tation with an extra mineral ra- tion ; if it turned out to be useful , he was lavish in his payments. thus , over the years , he attained a remarkably balanced diet. meanwhile , the plants had grown back around his ship , and he transplanted vines inside. they died , and he tried again , and still again , until he struck a variety that would endure the conditions he needed. they gave light and heat to replace his failing gener- ator , and proved to be much more efficient producers of free oxygen than the tanks of martian sword- grass which was standard on spaceships. he had been recovering water by the usual condensing meth- ods , replacing losses by baking gypsum , but his nlw plants '' learned '' to give him as much alcohol -free water as he wanted. he could have had the alcohol , too , but he did n't like to drink alone. and surely few men had ever been as lonely as he.

'' bennett waited expectantly. '' headaches without organic causes are generally the result of repressed anger , '' hall went on. '' that anger can stem from any number of traumatic situations or attitudes , all deeply buried in the unconscious , of course , or they would not have the power to hurt us. from what we know of you , however , it seems to be the result of frustration. in other words , you have created a fantasy image of a completely unattain- able woman , and therefore none of the women you meet can ful- fil ! your expectations. since she is unattainable , you naturally feel a sense of frustration.

'' this woman is wondering if her lover is true to her — and if her husband will find out about them.

'' your particular release was one of the most difficult that i have ever encountered. in fact , i was unable to bring you back myself , and asked your wife , lima , to enter the somno with me and help force you to return.* bits of recollection , which had been edging into bennett 's mem- ory , burst through in full force , and he remembered. it was true. he was benn ett , le roy of the city-state of thone. he turned to lima and , as he read the glad light in her eyes , he knew that she had witnessed the return of his complete mem- ory.

'* i recognized the voice as belonging to one of the organtoned commentators in aural effects and expertized the script without effort as emanating from one of tildy 's girl copywriters. the talented slovenliness that would confuse venus with a star had to come from somebody on her staff. '' this is the ship that a modern columbus will drive through the void , '' said the voice. `` six and a half million tons of trapped lightning and steel — an ark for eighteen hundred men and women , and everything to make a new world for their home. who will be in it ? what fortunate pioneers will tear an empire from the rich , fresh soil of another world ?

'' that 's not what i mean. you remember what happened with 14 antarctic exploitation. '' '' i was there. a hundred and forty casualities on our side. god knows what they lost. '' '' and that was only one continent. taunton takes these things pretty personally ; if he filed a feud over that , wo n't he do it for a whole planet ? '' fowler said patiently , `` no , mitch. he would n't dare. in the first place , industrial feuds are expensive. preliminary hearings alone can tie up the whole legal staff for weeks , when we get through with our injunctions and counter-claims. in the second place , he does n't have grounds — this is a legal , perfectly openand-aboveboard assignment by the incorporated government of the united states of america ; he ca n't question it. in the third place , we 'd whip his tail off. '' '' i guess you 're right , '' i admitted. it was just as well , as far as i 'm concerned. believe me , i 'm a loyal employee of fowler shocken associates ; ever since cadet days i have tried to live my life `` for company and for sales. '' but industrial feuds can be pretty messy. our profession has been comparatively free of them — reasonable men can talk these things out nine times out of ten. but it was only a few decades ago , back in 2039 , that a small but highly effective advertising agency in london filed a feud against one of our bigger competitors , wiping out every executive on the. staff. and they say there are still bloodstains on the steps of the general post office where two delivery companies had fought it out for the federal postal contract , which , like the armed services , national and local police forces and other former government agencies , are let to private enterprise as they should be. schocken was speaking again ; my attention whipped back. '' there 's one thing you 'll have to watch for , '' he cautioned. `` this is the kind of project that is bound to bring out the lunatic fringe. every crackpot organization on the list , from the connies themselves on down , is going to come out for or agin it. i do n't care how you do it , but make sure they 're all for. butter them up. we do n't want them to contend with as well as taunton.

'' maybe you could spread the word that space -travel is violently opposed to the principles of conservationism. uses up too many raw materials , hurts the general living standard — you gravy plan 61 15 know , the usual unrealistic line. bring in the fact that rocket fuel uses organic material that the connies think should be made into fertilizer . . i like to watch an expert at work. fowler schocken laid down a whole sub-campaign for me right there ; i took it down and filled in the details. the conservationists were fair game , those wild-eyed zealots who pretended that modern scientific method was not competent to meet with the demands of our expanding population and dwindling resources. i had been exposed to connie sentiment in my time , and the arguments had always come down to one thing : nature 's way of living was the right way of living. if `` nature '' had intended us to eat fresh vegetables , it would n't have given us niacin or thiamin chloride. i sat still for twenty minutes more of fowler schocken 's inspirational talk , and came away with the discovery that i had often made before : briefly and effectively , he had given me every fact and instruction i needed. the details he left to me ; but i knew my job. the government wanted venus colonized by americans. to accomplish this , three things were needed : colonists ; a way of getting them to venus : and something for them to do when they u got there in one piece. the first was direct advertising. schocken 's tv commercial had blueprinted that , and it would be easy. it is always easy to persuade men and women — particularly american men and women who have pioneer blood in their veins — that the grass is greener far away. i had already penciled in a tentative campaign with the budget well under a megabuck. more would have been extravagant. the second was only partly our problem. the ships had been designed — by republic aviation , bell telephone labs and u. s. steel , i believe , under defense corporation contract. our job was n't to make the transportation to venus possible , but to make it palatable. when your wife found her burned-out toaster impossible to replace because its nichrome element was part of a venus rocket 's main drive jet , or when the inevitable disgruntled congressman for a small and frozen-out firm waved an appropriations sheet around his head and talked about government waste on wildcat schemes , our job began : we had to convince your wife that rockets are more important than toasters ; we had to"

'' good girl , '' i told her , `` when does the pole rocket shoot off ? m '' twelve minutes , from strip six , mr , courtenay. here are your ticket and the . reservation. and some lunch in case — `` '' fine. i did miss a meal.

'' that was n't so good. force twelve — hurricane — would have been a blast from his office on the order of : `` how dare you question the decision of a board man working on his own project ? never let me hear again — `` and so on. force four — rising gale , small craft malic tor harbor — was something like : `` gentlemen. i 'm sure mr. court : nay had perfectly good reasons for doing what he did. often the big picture is lost to the purely routine workers in our organization — `` i asked hester : `` is runstead 's secretary just a hired hand or one of his — `` i was going to say '' stooges , * ' but smoothly reversed my field — `` one of his confidants ? '' '' she 's pretty close to him. '' hester said cautiously. '' what was her reaction to the san diego business ? '' '' somebody told me she laughed her head off. mr. courtcnay. '' i did n't push it any harder. finding out where. i stood with respect to the big guns was legitimate. asking about the help was asking her to rat on them. not that there were n't girls who did. `` i expect to be right back.

'' we were at the ramp on strip six. tt was a miserable trip on a *- miserable , undersized tourist rocket. we flew low and there were prism windows at all seats , which never fail to make me airsick. you turn your head and look out and you 're looking straight down. worse , all the ads were taunton associates jobs. you look out the window and just as you convince your stomach that everything 's all right and yourself that it 's interesting country below , a sleazy , oversexed taunton ad for some inferior product opaques the window and one of their nagging , stupid jingles drills shrilly into your ear. over the amazon valley , for example , i was inspecting electric three , which happens to be the world 's biggest power dam , when : 54 calaxy science fiction bolster bra , bolster bra , bolsters all the way ; do n't you crumple , do n't you slumple ; keep them up to stay ! the accompanying before-andafter live pix were in the worst possible taste , and i found myself thanking god again that i worked for fowler schocken associates. it was the same off tierra del fuego. we left the great circle course 'for a look at the whale fisheries , vast sea areas inclosed by booms that let the plankton in and did n't let the whales out. i was watching with fascination as a cow whale nursed her calf — it looked something like an aerial refueling operation — when the window opaqued again for another dose of taunton shock treatment : sister , do you smell like this to your mister ? the olfactory went on , and_ i had to use my carton while the ad chirped : no wonder he 's hard to getf use swett ! my seatmate , a nondescript customer m universal apparel , watched sympathetically as i retched. `` too much for you , friend ? '' he asked , showing the maddening superiority people who suffer from motion-sickness know too well. **uh , h i said. '' some of those ads are enough to make anybody sick. '' '' exactly what do you mean by that remark ? '' i asked evenly. it frightened him. `` i only meant that it smelled a little strong , '' he said hastily. `` just that particular ad. i did n't mean ads in general. there 's nothing wrong with me !

'' he shriveled into his half of the seat. i had n't enjoyed squelching him , but it was a matter of principle. a kid overhearing that kind of talk could be turned into a pushover for a slick connie. we were held up over little america while a couple of other tourist craft touched down. one of them was from india and i mellowed at the sight. that ship , from nose to tail , was indiastry-built. the crewmen were indiastry-trained and indiastryemployed. the passengers , wak gravy planit ing and sleeping , paid tribute minute by minute to indiastry. and indiastry paid tribute to fowler schocken associates. a tow truck hauled us into the great double-walled plastic doughnut that is little america. there was only one check point. little america is an invisible export — a dollar trap for the tourists of the world , with no military value. ( there are polar military bases , but they are small , scattered and far under the ice , run by columbia field forces , inc. ) a small thorium reactor heats and powers the place. even if some nation desperate for fissionable material were to try to get it , it would n't have anything worth fighting for. windmills eke out the thorium reactor , and there 's some `` heat pump '' arrangement that i do n't underst ind which ekes out the windmills. at the check point i asked about runstead. the officer looked him up and said : `` he 's on the two-day tour out of new york. thomas cook and son. his quarters are iii-c-2205. '' he pulled out a map of the place and showed me that this meant third ring in. third floor up. fifth sector , twenty-second room. `` you ca n't miss it. i can accommodate you with a nearby room , mr. courtenay — `` '' thanks. later. '' i shoved off and elbowed my way through crowds chattering in a dozen languages to iii-c-2205 and rang the bell. no answer. a pleasant young man said to me : `` i 'm the tour director. can i help you ?
