The Puppet Masters By ROBERT A. HEINLEIN 

FOR mc it started too early 
on July 12, 2007, with my 
phone shrilling. The sort of 
phone my section uses is not 
standard; the audio relay was 
buried surgically under the skin 
back of my left ear — bone conduction, and skull lifting. 

"All right," I growled. "I hear 



you. Shut off that damned noise.** 
"Emergency," a voice said in 
my ear. "Report in person to the 
Old Man. At once." 

"Moving." I acknowledged and 
sat up with a jerk that hurt my 
eyeballs. I went into the bath, 
injected a grain of "Gyro" into 
my arm, then let the vibro exer

cise machine shake me apart 
while the drug put me together. I 
stepped out a new man, or at 
least a good mockup of one, and 
got my jacket. 

There is one thing no head of 
a country can know and that is: 
how good is his intelligence system? He finds out only by having 
it fail him. Hence our section. 
Security suspenders and belt, you 
might say. United Nations had 
never heard of us, nor had Central Intelligence — I think. All I 
really knew about us was the 
training I had received and the 
jobs the Old Man sent me on. 
Interesting jobs if you don't care 
where you sleep, what you eat, 
nor how Jong you live. If I had 
had any sense. I'd have quit and 
taken a regular job. 

The only trouble with that 
would be that I wouldn't have 
been working for the Old Man 
any longer. That made the difference. 

Not that he was a soft boss. 
Hr was capable of saying, "Boys, 
we need to fertilize this tree. 
Jump in that hole at its base and 
I'll cover you up." 

We'd have done it. Any of us 
would. And the Old Man would 
bury us alive, too, if he thought 
there was a 53% probability that 
it was the Tree of Liberty he was 
nourishing. 

He got up and limped toward 
me as I came into our section 



offices through a washroom booth 
in MacArthur Station. His face 
split in a wicked smile. His big 
hairless skull and his strong 
Roman nose made him look like 
a cross between Satan and 
Punch's Judy. "Welcome, Sam,'* 
he said. "Sorry to get you out of 
bed." 

The deuce he was sorry! "1 was 
on'leave," I answered shortly. 

"Ah, but you still are. We're 
going on a vacation." 

"So my name is 'Sam'," I answered, deliberately ignoring his 
"vacation" crack. "What's my 
last name?" 

"Cavanaugh. And I'm your 
Uncle Charlie— Charles M. Cavanaugh, retired. Meet your sister 
Mary." 

I had been aware that there 
was another person in the room, 
but when the Old Man is present 
he gets full attention as long as he 
wants it. Now I looked over my 
"sister" and then looked her over 
again. It was worth it. 

I could see why he had set us 
up as brother and sister if we 
were to do a job together; it 
would give him a trouble-free 
pattern. An indoctrinated agent 
can't break his assumed character 
any more than a professional actor can intentionally muff his 
lines. So this one I must treat as 
my sister — a dirty trick if I ever 
met one I

ingty mammalian. Good legs. 
Broad shoulders for a woman. 
Fleming, wavy red hair and the 
real red -headed saurian bony 
structure to her skull. Her face 
was handsome rather than beautiful; she looked me over as if I 
were a piece of furniture. 

I wanted to drop one wing and 
run in circles. It must have 
showed, for the Old Man said 
gently. "Tut, tut, Sammy. Your 
sister dotes on you and you are 
extremely fond of her, but in a 
healthy, clean-cut, sickeningly 
chivalrous, All - American - Boy 
way." 

"As bad as that?" I asked. 
"Worse." 

"Oh, well — Howdy, Sis." 

She stuck out a hand. It was 
firm and seemed as strong as 
mine. "Hi, Bud." Her voice was 
deep contralto, which was all I 
needed. Damn the Old Man! 

"T might add." he went on, 
"that you are so devoted to Mary 
that you would gladly die to protect her. I dislike telling you so, 
Sammy, but your sister is a 
leette more valuable — for the 
present, at least — to the organization than you are." 

"Got it." I acknowledged. 
"Thanks for the qualification." 

"Now, Sammy — " 

"She's my favorite sister; I 
protect her from dogs and strange 
men. All right, when do we 
start?" 



"Better stop over in Cosmetics. 
They have a new face for you." 

"Make it a whole new head. 
See you. 'By, Sis." 

rpHEY did not quite do that, 
but they did fit my phOne 
under the back of my skull and 
then cement hair over it. They 
dyed my hair to the same shade 
as that of my newly acquired 
sister, bleached my skin, and did 
things to my cheekbones and 
chin. The mirror showed me to 
be as good a redhead as Sis. I 
looked at my hair and tried to 
recall what its natural shade had 
been, way back when. Then E 
wondered about Sis. I hoped she 
was what she seemed to be. 

I put on the kit they gave me 
and somebody handed me a jump 
bag already packed. 

The Old Man had been in Cosmetics, too; his skull was now 
covered by crisp curls of a shade 
between pink and white. They 
had done something to his face, 
I could not tell just what — but 
we were all three clearly related 
by blood and of that curious subrace, the redheads. 

"Come, Sammy," he said. "I'll 
brief you in the car." We went 
by a route I had not known about 
and ended up on the Northside 
launching platform, high above 
New Brooklyn and overlooking 
the ruins of Manhattan Crater. 

J. drove while the Old Man 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



talked. Once we were out of local 
control, he told me to set it automatic on Des Moines, Iowa. I 
then joined Mary and "Uncle 
Charlie" in the lounge. He gave 
us our personal histories up to 
date. "So here we are," he concluded, "a merry family party — 
tourists. And if we should happen 
to run into unusual events, that 
is how we will behave, as nosy 
end irresponsible tourists." 

"But what is the problem?" I 
asked. "Or do we play this one 
by ear?" 

"Possibly." 

"Okay. But when you're dead, 
it's nice to know why. Eh, 
Mary?" 

"Mary" did not answer. She 
had that quality, rare in babes, 
of not talking when she had nothing to say. 

"Sam, you've heard of 'Flying 
Saucers'.'' the Old Man said. 

"Huh?" 

"You've studied history." 

"You mean those? The Flying 
Saucer craze, way back before 
the Disorders? I thought you 
meant something recent and real; 
those were mass hallucinations." 

"Were they?" 

"Well, I haven't studied much 
statistical abnormal psychology, 
but I seem to remember an equation. That whole period was 
psychopathic; a man with all his 
gaskets tight would have been 
locked up." 



"Whereas this present day is 
sane, eh?" 

"I wouldn't go so far as to say 
that." I pawed back through my 
mind and found the answer I 
wanted. "I remember that equation now — Digby's evaluating 
integral for second and high<r 
order data. It gave a 93.7 percent 
certainty that the Flying Saucer 
myth, after elimination of explained cases, was hallucination. 
I remember it because it was the 
first case of its type in which the 
instances had been systematically 
collected and evaluated. A government project, though God 
knows why." 

The Old Man looked benign. 
"Brace yourself, Sammy. We are 
going to inspect a Flying Saucer 
today. Maybe we'll even saw off 
a souvenir, like true tourists." 

"OEVENTEEN hours," the Old 
Man glanced at his finger 
watch and added, "and twentythree minutes ago, an unidentified spaceship landed near Grinnell, Iowa; Type unknown. Approximately disc-shaped and 
about one hundred and fifty feet 
across. Origin unknown, but — " 

"Didn't they track a trajectory 
on it?" I interrupted. 

"They did not," he answered. 
"Here is a photo of it taken by 
Space Station Beta after landing." 

I looked it over and passed it

to Mary. It was as unsatisfactory 
Bb ;i telephoto taken from five 
thousand miles out usually is. 
Trees looking like moss ... a 
cloud shadow that loused up the 
best part of the pic . . . and a 
gray circle that might have been 
a disc-shaped ship and could just 
as well have been an oil tank or 
a water reservoir. 

Mary handed the pic back. I 
said, "What else do we know?" 

"Nothing." 

"Nothing? After seventeen 
hours? We ought to have agents 
pouring out of their ears!" 

"We did have. Two within 
reach and four that were sent in. 
They failed to report back. I dislike losing agents, Sammy, especially with no results." 

I had a sudden cold realization 
that the situation must be 
damned serious. The Old, Man 
had chosen to bet his own brain 
against the loss of the organization — for he was the Section. I 
suddenly felt chilly. Ordinarily, 
an agent has a duty to save his 
own neck, in order to complete 
his mission and report back. On 
this job it was the Old Man who 
must come back, and, after him, 
Mary. I was as expendable as a 
paper clip. 

"One agent made a partial report," the Old Man went on. "He 
went in as a casual bystander and 
reported by phone that it must 
be a spaceship. He then reported 



that the ship was opening and 
that he was going to try to get 
closer, past the police lines. The 
last thing he said was, 'Here they 
come. They are little creatures, 
about — ' Then he shut off." 
"Little men?" 

" 'Creatures' was what he said.** 

"Peripheral reports?" 

"Plenty. The Des Moines 
stereocasting station sent mobile 
units in for spot cast. The pictures they sent out were all long 
shots, taken from the air. They 
showed nothing but a disc -shaped 
object. Then, for about two hours, 
no pictures and no news, followed 
later by closeups and a new hews 
s.lant." 

I said, "Well?" 

"The thing was a hoax. The 
'spaceship' was a sheet metal and 
plastic fraud, built by two farm 
boys, in woods near their home. 
The fake reports originated with 
an announcer who had put the 
boys up to it to make a story. He 
has been fired and the latest 'invasion from outer space' turns 
out to be a gag." 

"A hoax — but we lose six men. 
We going to look for them?" 

"No. We would not find them. 
We are going to try to figure out 
why triangulation of this photograph — " he held up the teleshot 
taken from the Space Station — 
"doesn't quite jibe with the news 
reports, and why Des Moines 
stereo shut down for a while.**

Mary spoke up for the first 
time. "I'd like to talk with those 
farm boys." 

IROADED the car five miles 
this side of Gri.nn.ell and we 
started looking for the McLain 
farm — the news reports had 
named Vincent and George McLain as the culprits. It wasn't 
hard to find. At a fork in the road 
was a big sign: this way TO THE 
spaceship. Shortly the road was 
parked both sides with duos and 
groundcars and triphibs. A couple 
of stands dispensed cold drinks 
and souvenirs at the turnoff into 
the McLain place. A state cop 
was directing traffic. 

"Pull up." directed the Old 
Man. "Might as well see the fun, 
eh?" 

'■Right, Uncle Charlie," I 
agreed. 

The Old Man bounced out, 
swinging his cane. I handed Mary 
out and she snuggled up to me, 
grasping my arm. She looked up 
at me, managing to look both 
stupid and demure. ''My, but 
you're strong, Buddy." 

I wanted to slap her. That 
poor-little-me routine from one 
of the Old Man's agents — a smile 
from a tiger. 

"Uncle Charlie" buzzed around, 
bothering state police, buttonholing people, stopping to buy cigars 
at a stand, and giving a picture 
of a well-to-do, senile old fool, 



out for a holiday. He turned and 
waved his cigar at a state sergeant. "The inspector says it is a 
fraud, my dears — a prank 
thought up by boys. Shall we 
go?" 

Mary looked disappointed. "No 
spaceship?" 

"There's a spaceship, if you 
want to call it that," the cop answered. "Just follow the suckers. 
It's sergeant, not inspector." 

We set out, across a pasture 
and into some woods. It cost a 
dollar to get through the gate and 
many turned back. The path 
through the woods was rather 
deserted. I moved carefully, wishing for eyes in the back of my 
head instead of a phone. Uncle 
Charlie aad Sis walked ahead, 
Mary chattering like a fool and 
somehow appearing to be both 
shorter and younger than she had 
been on the trip out. We came to 
a clearing and there was the 
"spaceship." 

rt was more than a hundred 
feet across, but it was whipped 
together out of light-gauge metal 
and sheet plastic, sprayed with 
aluminum. It was the shape of 
two pie plates, face to face. Aside 
from that, it looked like nothing 
in particular. Nevertheless, Mary 
squealed, "Oh, how exciting!" 

A youngster, eighteen or nineteen, with a permanent sunburn 
and a pimply face, stuck his hrnd 
out of a hatch in the top of the 



10 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



monstrosity. "Care to see inside?" 
he called out. He added that it 
would be fifty cents apiece more 
and Uncle Charlie shelled out. 

Mary hesitated at the hatch. 
Pimple face was joined by what 
appeared to be his twin and they 
Started to hand her down in. She 
drew back and I moved in fast, 
intending to do any handling myself. My reasons were 99% professional; I could feel danger all 
through the place. "It's dark," 
she quavered. 

"It's safe," the second young 
man said. "We've been taking 
sightseers through all day. I'm 
Vince McLain. Come on, lady.** 

Uncle Charlie peered down the 
hatch, like a cautious mother 
hen. "Might be snakes in there," 
he decided. "Mary, I don't think 
you had better go in." 

"Nothing to fear," the first McLain said insistently. "It's safe." 

"Keep the money, gentlemen." 
Uncle Charlie glanced at his finger watch. "We're late. Let's go, 
my dears." 

I followed them back up the 
path, my hackles up until we 
reached the car. Once we were 
rolling, the Old Man said sharply, 
"Wey,, what did you see?" 

I countered with, "Any doubt 
about that first report? The one 
that broke off?" 

"None." 

"That thing wouldn't have 
fooled an agent, even in the dark. 



This wasn't the ship he saw.** 

"Of course not. What else?" 

"How much would you say 
that fake cost? New sheet metal, 
fresh paint, and from what I saw 
through the hatch, probably a 
thousand feet of lumber to brace 
it." 

"Go on." 

"Well, the McLain place had 
'mortgage' all over it. If the boys 
were in on the gag, they didn't 
foot the bill." 

"Obviously. You, Mary?" 

"Uncle Charlie, did you notice 
how they treated me?" 

"Who?" I said sharply. 

"The state sergeant and the 
two boys. When I use the sweetljttle -bundle -of -sex routine, something should happen. Nothing 
did." 

"They were attentive," I objected. 

"You don't understand. Something was wrong with them. 
Harem guards, if you know what 
I mean." 

"Hypnosis?" asked the Old 
Man. 

"Possibly. Or drugs, perhaps." 
She frowned and looked puzzled. 

"Sammy, take the next turn to 
the left. We're investigating a 
point two miles south of here." 

"The triangulated location by 
the pic?" I asked. 

"What else?" 

But we didn't get there. First 
it was a bridge out and I didn't 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



have room enough to make the 
car hop it, aside from traffic regulations for a duo on the ground. 
We circled south and came in 
again, the only remaining route. 
We were stopped by a young 
highway cop. A brush fire, he 
told us; go any farther and we 
would probably be drafted into 
nrefighting. He didn't know but 
what he ought to send me up to 
the nrelines anyhow. 

Mary waved her lashes at him 
and he relented. She pointed out 
that neither she nor Uncle Charlie 
could drive, a double lie. 

After we pulled away, I asked 
her, "Harem guard?" 

"Oh, my, no! A most attractive 
man." 

Her answer annoyed me. 

The Old Man vetoed taking to 
the air and making a pass over 
the spot. He said it was useless. 
We headed for Des Moines. Instead of parking at the toll gates, 
we paid to take the car into the 
city and ended up at the studios 
of Des Moines stereo. Uncle 
Charlie blustered our way into 
the office of the general manager. 
He told several lies — unless 
"Charles M. Cavanaugh" was actually a big wheel with the Federal Communications Authority. 
It wouldn't surprise me. 

Once inside, he continued the 
Big Brass act. "Now, sir, what is 
this nonsense about a spaceship 
hoax? Speak plainly. Your license 



may depend on your answer." 

The manager was a little 
round-shouldered man, but he, 
did not seem cowed, merely irritated. "We've made full explanation over the channels," he said. 
"We were victimized. The man 
has been discharged." 

"Hardly adequate, sir." 

The little man — Barnes, his 
name was — shrugged. "What do 
you expect? Want us to string 
him up by his thumbs?" 

Uncle Charlie pointed his cigar 
at him. "I warn you, sir, I am 
not to be trifled with. I am not 
convinced that two farm louts 
and a junior announcer could 
have pulled off this preposterous business. There was money in 
it. Yes, sir — money! Now tell me, 
just what did you — " 

Mary had seated herself close 
by Barnes' desk. She had done 
something to her costume and 
her pose put me in mind of 
Goya's Disrobed Lady. She made 
thumbs-down to the Old Man. 

Barnes should not have caught 
it; his attention appeared to be 
turned to the Old Man. But he 
did. He turned toward Mary and 
his face went dead. He reached 
for his desk. 

"Sam! Kill him!" the Old Man 
rapped. 

I burned his legs off and his 
trunk fell to the floor. It was a 
poor shot; I had intended to get 
him neatly.

1 stepped in and kicked his gun 
away from still-groping fingers. 
I was about to give him coup de 
grace — a man burned that way 
is dead, but it takes a while to 
die — when the Old Man snapped, 
"Don't touch him! Mary, stand 
backl" 

He sidled toward the body, 
like a cat investigating the unknown- Barnes gave a long sigh 
and was quiet. The Old Man 
poked him gently with his cane. 

"Boss," I said, "time to git, 
isn't it?" 

Without looking around he answered, "We're as safe here as 
anywhere. This building may be 
swarming with them." 

"Swarming with what?" 

"How would I know? Swarming with whatever he was." He 
pointed at Barnes' body. "That's 
what I've got to find out." 

Mary gave a choked sob and 
gasped, "He's still breathing. 
Look!" 

The body lay face down; the 
back of the jacket heaved as if 
the chest were rising. The Old 
Man looked and poked at it with 
his cane. "Sam, come here." I 
came. "Strip it," he went on. 
"Wear gloves. And be careful." 

"Booby trap?" 

"Shut up. Use care." 

He must have had a hunch 
that was close to truth. I think 
the Old Man's brain . has a 
built-in integrator which arrives 




at logical necessity from minimum facts the way a museum Joe 
reconstructs an animal from a 
single bone. First pulling on 
gloves — agent's gloves; I could 
have stirred boiling acid, yet I 
could feel a coin in the dark and 
call heads or tails — I started to 
turn him over to undress him. 

The back was still heaving. I 
did not like the look of it — unnatural. I placed a palm between 
the shoulder blades. 

A man's back is bone and muscle. This was soft and undulating. 
I snatched my hand away. 

Without a word, Mary handed 
me a pair of scissors from Barnes'' 
desk. I took them and cut the 
jacket away. The body was 
dressed in a light singlet. Between 
this and the skin, from the neck 
halfway down the back, was 
something which was not flesh. A 
couple of inches thick, it gave the 
corpse an odd round -shoulderedj 
slightly humped appearance. 

It pulsed. 

AS we watched, it slid off 
the back, away from us. I 
reached out to peel up the singlet, but my hand was knocked 
away by the Old Man's cane. 

"Make up your mind," I said, 
and rubbed my knuckles. 

He did not answer, but tucked 
his cane under the shirt and worried it up the trunk. The thing 
was uncovered. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



Grayish, faintly translucent, 
and shot through with darker 
structure, shapeless — but it was 
clearly alive. As we watched, it 
flowed down into the space between Barnes" arm and chest, 
filled it and stayed there, unable 
to go farther. 

"Poor devil," the Old Man said 
softly. 

. "Huh? That?" 
"No. Barnes. Remind me to 



see that he gets the Purple Heart, 
when this is over. If it ever is 
over." The Old Man straightened up and stumped around 
the room, as if he had forgotten 
completely the thing nestling iri 
the crook of the dead man's arm. 

I drew back and continued to 
stare at it, my gun ready. It 
could not move fast; it obviously 
could not fly; but I did not know 
what it could do. Mary pressed 




tA 




 



her shoulder against mine, as if 
for human comfort. I put my 
free arm around her. 

On a side table there was a 
stack of cans, the sort used for 
stereo tapes. The Old Man took 
one, spilled out the reels and 
came back with it. "This will do, 
I think." He placed the can on 
the floor, near the thing, and began chivying it with his cane, trying to irritate it into crawling 




over the side and into the can. 

Instead it oozed back until it 
was almost entirely under the 
body. I grabbed the free arm and 
heaved Barnes away; the thing 
clung, then flopped to the floor. 
Under Uncle Charlie's direction, 
Mary and I used our guns at lowest power to force it, by burning 
the floor close to it, into the can. 
We got it in, a close fit, and I 
slapped the cover on. 

The Old Man tucked the can 
under his arm. "On our way, my 
dears." 

He paused in the door to call 
out a parting, then, after closing 
the door, stopped at the desk of 
Barnes* secretary. "I'll be seeing 
Mr. Barnes tomorrow," he told 
her. "No, no appointment. I'll 
phone." 

Out we went, slow march, the 
Old Man with the can full of 

thing under his arm and me with 
my cars cocked for alarums. 
Mary played the silly little 
moron, with a running monologue. The Old Man even paused 
in the lobby, bought a cigar, and 
inquired directions, with bumbling, self-important good nature. 

Once in the car he gave directions, then cautioned me against 
driving fast. The directions led 
us into a garage. The Old Man 
sent for the manager and said*, 
"Mr. Malone wants this car immediately." It was a signal I had 
had occasion to use myself; the

duo would cease to exist in about 
twenty minutes, save as anonymous spare parts in the service 
bins. 

The manager looked us over, 
then answered quietly, "Through 
that door over there." He sent 
the two mechanics out of the 
room and we ducked through the 
door. 

WE ended up in the apartment 
of an elderly couple. There 
the Old Man got his bald head 
back, I acquired a mustache, and 
Mary looked as well dark as she 
had as a redhead. The "Cavanaugh" combination was dropped: Mary got a nurse's costume 
and I was togged out as a chauffeiir while the Old Man became 
our elderly, invalid employer, 
complete with lap robe and tantrums. 

A car was waiting for us. The 
trip back was no trouble ; we 
could have remained the carrottopped Cavanaughs. I kept the 
screen tuned to Des Moines, but, 
if the cops had turned up the 
late Mr. Barnes, the newsboys 
hadn't heard about it. 

We went straight to the Old 
Man's office and there we opened 
the can. The Old Man sent for 
Dr. Graves, head of the Section's 
bio lab, and the job was done 
with handling equipment. 

What we needed were gas 
masks, though. A stink of decay


ing organic matter filled the room 
and forced us to slap the cover 
on and speed up the blowers. 

Graves wrinkled his nose. 
•'What in the world was that?" 
he demanded. 

The Old Man was swearing 
softly. "Find out," he said. "Work 
it in suits, in a germ-free compartment, and don't assume that 
it is dead." 

"If tli at is alive, I'm Queen 
Anne." 

"Maybe. Just don't take 
chances. It's a parasite, capable 
of attaching itself to a host, such 
as a man. and controlling the host. 
It is almost certainly extraterrestrial in origin and metabolism." 

The lab boss sniffed. "Extraterrestrial parasite on a terrestrial 
host? Ridiculous! The body 
chemistries would be incompatible." 

"When we captured it, it was 
living on a man. If that means 
it has to be a terrestrial organism, 
show me where it fits into terrestrial life-forms and where to 
look for its mates. And quit jumping to conclusions; I want facts." 

The biologist stiffened. "You'll 
get them!" 

"Get going. And don't keep assuming that the thing is dead; 
The perfume may be a protective 
device. That thing, if alive, is fantastically dangerous. If it gets on 
one of your laboratory men, I'll 
almost certainly have to kilt him."

The lab director left minus 
some of his cockiness. 

The Old Man settled back in 
his chair, sighed, and closed his 
eyes. '"How many mustard plasters the size of that thing can arrive in a spaceship as big as that 
fraud we looked at?" 

"Was there a spaceship?" I 
asked. "The evidence seems slim." 

"There was a ship. There still 
is.** 

"We should have examined the 
site." 

"That site would have been our 
last sight. The other six boys 
weren't fools. Answer my question.'* 

"How big the ship was doesn't 
tell me anything about its payload, when I don't know its propulsion method, the jump it 
made, or what the passengers require. How long is a piece of 
rope? If you want a guess, I'd say 
maybe several thousand." 

"So there may be several thousand zombies in Iowa tonight. Or 
harem guards, as Mary puts it." 
He thought for a moment. "But 
how am I to get past them to the 
harem? We can't go shooting 
every round-shouldered man in 
Iowa; it would cause talk." He 
smiled feebly. 

"I'll put you another question," 
I said. "If one spaceship lands in 
Iowa yesterday, how many will 
land in North Dakota tomorrow? 
Or Brazil?" 



"Yes." He looked still more 
troubled. "You kids go enjoy 
yourselves ; you may not have 
another chance. Don't leave the 
offices." 

¥ WENT to Cosmetics, got my 
skin color back and resumed 
my normal appearance, had a 
soak and a massage, and then 
went to the staff lounge in 
search of a drink and company. 
I looked around, not knowing 
whether I was looking for a 
blonde, brunette, or redhead, but 
fairly sure that I could spot the 
chassis. 

It was a redhead. Mary was in 
a booth, sipping a drink and looking much as she had looked at 
first. 

"Hi, Sis," I said, sliding in beside her. 

She smiled and answered, 
"Hello, Bud, drag up a rock," 
while moving to -make room for 
me. 

I dialed for bourbon and water 
and then said, "Is this your real 
appearance?"' 

She shook her head. "Not at 
all. Zebra stripes and two heads. 
What's yours?" 

"My mother smothered me 
with a pillow, so I never got a 
chance to find out." 

She looked at me as if I were 
a side of beef. "I can understand 
why, but I am more hardened 
than she was. You'll do, Bud." 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



"Thanks. Let's drop this 'Budand-Sis' act. It gives me inhibitions," 

"I think you need every one 
you can develop." 

"Mc? Never any violence with 
me; I'm the 'Barkis -is- willing" 
type." I might have added that, 
if I laid a hand on her and she 
happened not to like it, I'd bet 
that I would draw back a bloody 
stump. The Old Man's girls arc 
never sissies. 

She smiled. "Well, Miss Barkis 
is not willing." 

Whi le we sa t t he re , I got to 
thinking how well she would look 
on the other side of a fireplace. 
My job being what it was, I had 
never thought seriously about 
getting married — after all, a babe 
is just a babe : why get excited? 
But Mary was an agent herself. 
Talking to her would not be like 
shouting off Echo Mountain. 1 
realized that I had been lonely 
for one hell of a long time. 
"Mary — " 
"Yes?" 

"Are you married?" 

"No. But what business — I 
mean, why does it matter?" 

"Look me over. I've got both 
hands and feet, I'm fairly young, 
and I don't track mud in the 
house. You could do worse." 

"Listen, wolf, your technique 
is down. Just because a woman 
turns you down is no reason to 
lose your head and offer her a 



contract. Some women would be 
mean enough to hold you to it." 

"I meant it," I said peevishly. 

"What salary do you offer?" 

"Damn you! If you want that 
type of contract, I '11 go along. 
You can keep your pay and I'll 
give half of mine to you — unless 
you want to retire." 

She shook her head. "I'd never 
insist on a settlement contract, 
not with a man I was willing to 
marry in the first place — " 

"I didn't think you would." 

"Agents should not marry," she 
said flatly. 

"Agents shouldn't marry anyone but agents." 

She started to answer, but 
stopped suddenly. My phone was 
talking in my ear, the Old Man's 
voice, and I knew she was hearing him with hers. "Come into 
my office," he said. 

We both got up without saying anything. Mary stopped me 
at the door and looked up into 
my eyes. "That is why it is silly 
to talk about marriage. All the 
time we've been talking, you've 
been thinking about the job and 
so have I." 
"I have not." 

"Sam, suppose you were married and you woke up to find one 
of those things on your wife's 
shoulders, possessing her." There 
was horror in her eyes. "Suppose 
I found one of them on your 
shoulders." 




 



"I'll chance it. And I won't let 
one get to you." 

She touched my cheek. "I don't 
believe you would." 

We went on into the Old Man's 
office. 

He looked up to say, "Come 
along. We're leaving." 

"Where?" I answered. "Or 
shouldn't I ask?" 

"White House. See the President. Shut up." 

I did. 

A T the White House, the 
Secret Service guards gave us 
the works. An X-ray went beep 
and 1 surrendered' my heater. 
Mary turned out to be a walking 
arsenal; the machine gave four 
beeps and hiccough, although you 
would have sworn she couldn't 
hide a tax receipt. The Old Man 
surrendered his cane without 
waiting to be asked. 

Our audio capsules showed up 
both by X-ray and by metal detector, but the head guard ruled 
that anything embedded in flesh 
need not be classed as a weapon. 
They printed us, photographed 
our retinas, and ushered us into a 
waiting room while the Old Man 
was allowed to see the President 
alone. 

After quite a while we were 
ushered in. The Old Man introduced us. I stammered. Mary 
just bowed. The President said 
he was glad to see us and'turned 



on that smile, the way you see it 
in the stereo casts, and he made 
us feel that he was glad to see us. 
I felt warm inside and no longer 
embarrassed. 

The Old Man directed me to 
report all that I had done and 
seen and heard on this assignment. I tried to catch his eye 
when it came to the part about 
killing Barnes, but he wasn't having any, so I left out the Old 
Man's order to shoot and made it 
clear that I had shot to protect 
another agent — Mary — when I 
saw Barnes reach for his gun. The 
Old Man interrupted me. "Make 
your report complete." 

So I filled in the Old Man's 
order to shoot. The President 
threw the Old Man a glance, the 
only expression he showed. I went 
on about the parasite thing and 
then up to that present moment. 

It was Mary's turn. She fumbled trying to explain to the President why she expected to get a 
response out of normal men — and 
had not gotten it out of the McLain boys, the state sergeant, and 
Barnes. The President helped her 
by smiling warmly and saying, 
"My dear young lady, I quite 
believe it." 

Mary blushed. The President 
listened gravely while she finished, then sat still for several 
minutes. Presently he said to the 
Old Man. "Andrew, your section 
has been invaluable. Your reports 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



have sometimes tipped the balance in crucial occasions in history." 

The Old Man snorted. "So it's 
no, is it?" 

"1 did not say so." 

"You were about to." 

The President shrugged. "Andrew, I can't start what amounts 
to war on a woman's intuition." 

Mary took a step forward. 
"Mr. President," she said very 
earnestly, "I do know. Those were 
not nor mai male men." 

He answered, "You have not 
considered an obvious explanation — that they actually were, ah, 
'harem guards.' There are always 
such unfortunates. You merely 
happened to run across four in 
one day." 

Mary shut up. The Old Man 
"did not. "God damn it, Tom — " 
I shuddered; you don't talk .to 
the President that way — "I knew 
you when you were an investigating Senator and I was a key 
man in your investigations. You 
know I wouldn't bring you this 
fairy tale if there were any reasonable way to explain it. How 
about that spaceship? What was 
in it? Why couldn't I even reach 
the spot where it landed?" He 
hauled out the photograph taken 
by Space Station Beta and 
shoved it under the President's 
nose. 

The President seemed Unperturbed. "Ah, yes, you and I have 



a passion for facts. But I have 
sources of information other than 
your section. Take this photo — 
you made a point of it when you 
phoned. The metes and bounds of 
the McLairi farm as recorded in 
the local county courthouse check 
with the triangulated latitude and 
longitude of this object on this, 
photograph." The President looked up. "Once I got lost right ire 
my own neighborhood. You 
weren't even in your own neighborhood, Andrew." 

"Did you trot out to Des 
Moines and check those courthouse maps yourself, Tom?" 
"Of course not." 
"Thank God, or you would be 
carrying three pounds of pulsing 
tapioca between your shoulders 
and God save the United States! 
Be sure of this — the courthouse 
clerk and whatever agent was 
sent both are hag-ridden this very 
moment. Yes, and the Des 
Moines chief of police, ed itors 
around there, despatchers, cops; 
all sorts of key people. Tom, I 
don't know what we are up 
against, but they know what we 
are, and they are pinching off the 
nerve cells of our social organism 
before true messages can get back 
-^or they cover up true reports 
with false ones, just as they did 
with Barnes. Mr. President, you 
rnust order an immediate, drastic 
quarantine of the area!" 

" 'Barnes'," the President re



 



peated softly. "Andrew, I had 
hoped to spare you this, but — " 
He flipped a key at his desk. "Get 
me stereo station WDES, Des 
Moines, the manager's office." 

A screen lighted on his desk; 
he touched another switch and a 
solid display in the wall lighted 
up. We were looking into the 
room we had been in a few hours 
before. 

Looking into it past a man who 
filled most of the screen — Barnes. 

Or his twin. When I kill a man, 
I expect him to stay dead. I was 
shaken, but I still believed in 
myself and my heater. 

The man said, "You asked for 
me, Mr. President?" He sounded 
as if he were dazzled. 

"Yes, Mr. Barnes. Do you recognize these people?" 

He looked surprised. "I'm 
afraid not. Should I?" 

"Tell him to call in his office 
force," the Old Man said. 

The President did so. They 
trooped in, girls mostly, and I 
recognized the secretary who sat 
.outside the door. One of them 
squealed, "Ooh, it's the President." 

None of them identified us, 
which wasn't surprising with the 
Old Man and me, but Mary's appearance was just as it had been, 
and I will bet that her looks 
would be burned into the mind of 
any woman who had ever seen 
her. . 



But I noticed one thing about 
them — every one of them was 
round-shouldered. 

ri"*EN minutes later we were 
standing in the wind on the 
Rock Creek platform. 

The Old Man seemed shrunken 
and old. 

"What now. Boss?" I asked. 

"Eh? For you two, nothing. 
You are both on leave until recalled." 

"I'd like to take another look / 
at Barnes* office." 

"Stay out of Iowa. That's an 
order. " 

"What are you going to do, if 
I may ask?" 

"I am going down to Florida 
and lie in the sun and wait for 
the world to go to hell. If you 
have any sense, you'll do the 
same. There's damned little 
time." 

He squared his shoulders and 
stumped away. I turned to speak 
to Mary, but she was gone. I 
trotted off and overtook the Old 
Man. "Excuse me, Boss. Where 
did Mary go?" 

"On leave, no doubt. Don't 
bother me." 

I considered trying to relay to 
her through the section circuit, 
only I remembered that I did not 
know her right name, nor her 
code, nor her I. D. number. I 
thought of trying to bull it 
through by describing her, but 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



that was foolishness. Only Cosmetics Records knows the original 
appearance of an agent and they 
won't talk. 

All I knew was that she had 
twice appeared as a redhead and 
that, for my taste, she was "why 
men fight." Try punching that 
into a phone! 

Instead, I found a room for the 
night. 

T WOKE up at dusk and looked 
out as the Capital came to life 
for the night. The river swept 
away in a wide band past the 
Memorial ; they were adding 
fluorescine to the water above the 
District, so the river stood out 
in curving sweeps of glowing rose 
and amber and emerald and shining fire. Pleasure boats cut 
through the colors, each filled, I 
had no doubt, with couples up to 
no good and enjoying it. 

On the land, here and there 
among older buildings, bubble 
domes were lighting up, giving 
the city a glowing fairyland look. 
To the east, where the Bomb had 
landed, there were no old buildings at all and the area was an 
Easter basket of color — giant 
eggs, lighted from within. 

I've seen the Capital at night 
oftener than most and had never 
thought much about it, but tonight I had that "Last Ride Together" feeling. It was not its 
beauty that choked me up; it was 



knowing that down under those 
warm lights were people, alive 
and individual, making love or 
having spats, doing business or 
giving the business, whatever they' 
damn well pleased, each under 
his own vine and fig tree with 
nobody to make him afraid, as 
it says. 

I thought about all those people — each with a gray slug clinging to his back, twitching his legs 
and arms, making his voice say 
what the slug wished, going where 
the slug wanted to go. 

I made myself a solemn promise; if the parasites won, I'd be 
dead before I would let one of 
those things ride me. For an agent 
it would be simple; just bite my 
nails — or, if your hands happen 
to be off there are other ways. 
The Old Man planned for all 
professional necessities. 

Except that it was his business 
and mine to keep those people 
down there safe, not to run out 
when the going got tough. 

I turned away. There was not 
a confounded thing I could do 
about it now; I decided that what 
I needed was company. The room 
contained the usual Catalog of 
"escort bureaus" and "model 
agencies" that you'll find in almost any big hotel. I thumbed 
through it, then slammed it shut. 
I didn't want just any girl: I 
wanted one particular girl, who 
would as soon shoot as shake 




 



hands. And I did not know where 
she had gone. 

I always carry a tube of "ternpus fugit" pills,, figuring you never 
know when giving your reflexes 
a jolt will get you through a tight 
spot. Despite the scare propaganda, tempus pills are not habitforming, the way hashish is. 

Nevertheless, a purist would 
say I was addicted, for I took 
them occasionally to make a 
twenty-four hour leave seem like 
a week, I enjoyed the mild euphoria the pills induced. Primarily, though, they just stretch 
your subjective time by a factor 
of ten or more — chop time into 
finer bits so that you live longer 
for the same amount of clockand-calendar. Sure, I know the 
horrible example of the young 
man who died of old age in a 
month through taking the pills 
steadily, but I took them only 
once in a while. 

Maybe he had the right idea. 
He lived a long and happy life — 
you can be sure it seemed to him 
both long and happy — -and died 
happy at the end. What matter 
that the sun rose only thirty 
times? Who is keeping score and 
what are the rules? 

I sat there, staring at my tube 
of pills and thinking that I had 
enough to keep me hopped up for 
what would be, to me, at least 
two "years." I could crawl m my 
hole and pull it in after me. 



I took out two pills and got a 
glass of water. Then I put the 
pills back in the tube, donned my 
gun, left the hotel and headed for 
the Library of Congress. 

On the way I stopped in a bar 
and looked at a newscast. There 
was no news from Iowa, but when, 
is there ever any? 

At the Library I went to the 
catalog, put on blinkers and 
started scanning for references. 
"Flying Saucers" led to "Flying 
Discs," then to "Project Saucer,'* 
then "Lights in the Sky," "Fire"balls," "Cosmic Diffusion Theory 
©f Life Origins," and two dozen 
blind alleys and screwball branches of literature. I needed a Geiger 
counter to tell me what was pay 
dirt, especially because what I 
wanted was sure to carry a semantic-content key classing it between Aesop's fables and the Lost 
Continent myths. 

In an hour, though, I had a 
Biandful of selector cards. I 
handed them to the vestal virgin 
at the desk and waited while she 
fed them into the hopper. Presently she said, "Most of the films 
you want are in use. The rest will 
fee delivered to Study Room 9-A, 
Take the escalator, puhlease." 

Room 9-A had one occupant, 
who looked up and said, "Well, 
the wolf in person! How did you 
pick me up? I could swear I shook 
you." 

I said, "Hello, Mary." 



THE PUPPET MASTERS

"Hello," she answered, "and 
now good-bye. Miss Barkis still 
ain't willin' and she has work to 
do." 

I got annoyed. "Listen, you 
conceited twerp, odd as it may 
seem, I did not come here looking 
for your no-doubt beautiful body, 
I occasionally do some work myself. When my spools arrive, I'll 
get the hell out and find another 
study room — a stag one!" 

Instead of flaring back, she immediately softened. "I'm sorry, 
Sam. Really. A woman hears the 
same thing so many thousand 
times — Sit down." 

"Thanks, but I'll leave. I'm 
here to work." 

"Stay," she insisted. "Read that 
notice. If you remove spools from 
the room to which they are delivered, you will not only cause 
the sorter to blow a dozen tubes, 
but you'll give the chief reference librarian a nervous breakdown." 

"I'll bring them back when I'm 
through." 

She took my arm and warm 
tingles went up it. "Please, Sam. 
T said I'm sorry." 

I sat down and grinned. "Nothing could persuade me to leave. 
I don't intend to let you out of 
sight until I know your phone 
code, your home address, and the 
true color of your hair," 

"Wolf," she replied softly. 
"You'll never know any of them.** 



She made a great business of fitting her head back into her study 
machine while ignoring me, 

The delivery tube went thunk 
and my spools spilled into the 
basket. I stacked them on the 
table by the other machine. One 
rolled over against the spools 
Mary had stacked up and knocked them down. I picked up what

"But It is. It's the one I want 
next." 

Sooner or later, I can see the 
obvious. Mary wouldn't be there 
to study the history of footgear. 
I picked up others of hers and 
read the labels. "So that's why 
nothing I wanted was in," I said. 
"But you didn't do a thorough 
job." I handed her my selection. 

Mary looked them ever, then 
pushed them all into a single pile. 
"Shall we split them, or both of 
us see them all?" 

"Fifty-fifty to weed out the 
junk, then we'll both go over the 
remainder," I decided. "Let's get 
Tbusy." 

Even after having seen the 
parasite on poor Barnes' back, 
even after being assured by the 
Old Man that a "Flying Saucer" 
had in fact landed, I was not prepared for the pile of evidence to 
be found buried in a public library. A pest on Digby and his 
evaluating formula! The evidence 
was unmistakable; earth had been 
visited by ships from outer space 
not once but many times. 

The reports long antedated our 
own achievement of space travel; 
some ran back into the Seventeenth Century, or even earlier 
than that, but it was impossible 
to judge reports dating back to 
the time when "science" meant an 
appeal to Aristotle. The first systematic data came from the 
1940s and 50s; the next flurry was 



in the 13?!©s. T noticed something 
and started taking down dates. 
Strange objects in the sky appeared to hit a cycle at thirtyyear intervals, about. A statistical 
analyst might make something of 
it 

"Flying Saucers" were tied in 
with "mysterious disappearances" 
not only through being in the 
same category as sea serpents, 
bloody rain, and such like wild 
data, but also because in welldocumented instances, pilots had 
chased "Saucers" and never come 
back, or down, anywhere, i.e., officially classed as crashed in wild 
country and not recovered — an 
easy-out explanation. 

I got another wild hunch and 
tried to see whether or not there 
was a thirty-year cycle in mysterious disappearances and, if so, 
did it match the objects- in -thesky cycle? I could not be surethere are too many people disappearing every year for all kinds 
of reasons. But vital records 
have been kept for a long time 
and not all were lost in the bombings. I noted it down to farm out 
for professional analysis. 

Mary and I did not exchange 
three words all night. Eventually 
we got up and stretched. Then I 
lent Mary change to pay the machine for the spools of notes she 
had taken (why don't women 
carry change?) and got my wires 
out of hock, too.

"Well, what's the verdict?" I 
asked. 

"I feel like a sparrow who has 
built a nice nest in a rain spout." 

I recited the old jingle. "And 
we'll do the same — refuse to learn 
and build again in the spout." 

"Oh, no! Sam, we've got to do 
something! It makes a full pattern; this time they are moving 
in to stay." 

"Could be. I think they are." 

"Well, what do we do?" 

"Honey, you are about to learn 
that in the Country of the Blind, 
the one-eyed man is in for a hell 
of a rough ride." 

"Don't be cynical. There isn't 
time." 

"No, there isn't. Let's, get out 
of here." 

Dawn was on us and the library 
was almost deserted. I said, "Tell 
you what. Let's find a barrel of 
beer, take it to my hotel room, 
bust in the head, and talk this 
over." 

She shook her head. "Not to 
your room." 

"Damn it, this is business." 

"Let's go to my apartment. It's 
only a couple of hundred miles 
away; I'll fix breakfast there." 

I recalled my purpose in life 
just in time to leer. "That's the 
best offer I've had all night. 
Seriously, why not the hotel? 
We'd save a half hour's travel," 

"You don't want to come to 
rny apartment? I won't bite you." 



"I was hoping you would. No, 
I was wondering why the sudden 
switch." 

"Well, perhaps I wanted to 
show you the bear traps around 
my bed. Or perhaps I wanted to 
prove to you I could cook." 

I flagged a 'copter taxi and we 
went to her apartment. 

When we got inside she made 
a careful search of the place, then 
came back and said, "Turn, 
around. I want to feel your back." 

"Why—" 

"Turn around!" I shut up. She 
gave it a good knuckling, then 
said, "Now you feel mine." 

"With pleasure!" Nevertheless 
I did a proper job, for I saw what 
she was driving at. There was 
nothing under her clothes but girl 
and assorted items of lethal hardware. 

She turned around and gave a 
sigh. "That's why I didn't want 
to go to your hotel. Now I know 
we are safe for the first time since 
I saw that thing on the station 
manager's back. This apartment 
is tight; I turn off the air and 
leave it sealed like a vault every 
time I leave it." 

"Say, how about the air conditioning ducts?" 

"I didn't turn on the conditioner system ; I cracked one of 
the air raid reserve bottles instead. Never mind; what would 
you like to eat?" 

"Any chance of a steak with

just the chill taken off it?" 

There was. While we chomped, 
we watched the newscast. Still no 
news from Iowa. 

1DID not get to see the bear 
traps; she locked her bedroom 
door. Three hours later she woke 
me and we had a second breakfast. Presently we struck cigarettes and I switched off the newscast It was principally a display 
of the entries for "Miss America." 
Ordinarily I would have watched 
with interest, but none of the 
babes was round-shouldered. 
I said, "Well?" 

"We've got to arrange the facts 
and rub the President's nose in 
them.'* 

"How?" 

"We've got to see him again." 

I repeated, "How?" 

She had no answer. 

I said, "We've got only one 
route — through the Old Man." 

I put in the call, using both 
our codes so that Mary could 
hear. Presently I heard, "Chief 
Deputy Oldfield, for the Old 
Man. Shoot." 

"It's got to be the Old Man." 

There was a pause. "Is this official or unofficial?" 

"Uh, I guess you'd call it unofficial," 

"Well, I won't put you through 
for anything unofficial. And anything official I am handling." 

I switched off before I used any 



bad language. Then I coded 
again. The Old Man has a special code which is guaranteed to 
raise him up out of his coffin, 
but God help the agent who uses 
it unnecessarily. 

He answered with profanity. 

"Boss," I said, "on the Iowa 
matter — " 

He broke off short. 

"Yes?" 

"Mary and I spent all night 
digging data out of the files. We 
want to talk it over." 

The profanity resumed. Presently he told me to turn it in for 
analysis and added that he intended to have my ears fried for 
a sandwich. 

"If you can run out, so can wc," 
I said sharply. "Mary and I are 
resigning right now. That's official!" 

Mary's eyebrows went up, but 
she said nothing. There was a 
long silence, then he* said, in a 
tired voice, "Palmglade Hotel, 
North Miami Beach." 

"Right away." I sent for a taxi 
and we went up on the roof. I had 
the hackie swing out over the 
ocean to avoid the Carolina speed 
traps, so we made good time. 

THE Old Man lay there, looking sullen and letting sand 
dribble through his fingers, while 
we reported. I had brought along 
a buzz box so that he could get it 
directly off the wire.

He glanced up when we came 
to the point about thirty-year 
cycles, but he let it ride until my 
later query about possible similar 
cycles in disappearances, whereupon he called the Section. "Get 
me Analysis. Hello, Peter? This 
is the boss. I want a curve on unexplained disappearances, starting with 1800. Huh? Smooth out 
known factors and discount 
steady load— what I want is 
humps and valleys. When? Two 
hours ago; what are you waiting 
for?" 

He struggled to his feet, let me 
hand him his cane and said, 
"Well, back to the jute mill." 

"To the White House?" Mary 
asked eagerly. 

"Eh? Be your age. You two 
have picked up nothing that 
would change the President's 
mind. 1 ' 

"Oh. Then what?" 

"I don't know. Keep quiet, unless you have a bright idea." 

The Old Man had a car and I 
drove us back. After I turned it 
over to block control, I said, 
"Boss, I've got something that 
might convince the President." 
He grunted. "Like this," I went 
on. "Send two agents in, me and 
one other. The other agent carries a portable scanning rig and 
keeps it trained on me. You get 
the President to watch." 

"Suppose nothing happens." 

"I'll make it happen. I am go


ing where the spaceship landed 
and bull my way through. We'll 
get closeuppix of the real ship, 
piped into the White House. Then 
I'll go to Barnes' office and investigate those round' shoulders. 
I'll tear shirts off right in front 
of the camera. There won't be any 
finesse: I'll just bust things wide 
open." 

"You realize you have the same 
chance as a mouse at a cat convention?" 

"I'm not so sure. As I see it, 
these things haven't superhuman 
powers. I'll bet they are limited 
to whatever the human being 
they are riding can do. I don't 
plan on being a martyr. In any 
case I'll get pix." 

"It might work," Mary put in. 
"I'll be the other agent. T can — " 

The Old Man and I said "No" 
together — and then I flushed; it 
Was not my prerogative. 

Mary went on, "I was going to 
say that I am the logical one because of the, uh, talent I have 
for spotting a man with a parasite." 

"No," the Old Man repeated. 
"Where he's going, they'll all 
have riders — assumed so until 
proved otherwise. Besides, I am 
saving you for something." 

"For what? This is important.'* 
The Old Man said quietly, "So 
is the other job. I'm planning to 
make you a Presidential bodyguard." 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



"Oh." She thought and answered, "I'm riot certain I could 
spot a woman who was possessed. 
I'm not. uh, equipped for it." 

"So we take his women secretaries away from him. And you'll 
be watching him, too, Mary." 

"And what if I find that one 
has gotten to him, in spite of 
ell our careful precautions?" 

"You take necessary action, the 
Vice President succeeds to the 
chair, and you get shot for 
treason. Now about this mission. 
We'll send Jarvis with the scanner and include Davidson as 
hatchet man. While Jarvis keeps 
the pickup on you, Sam. Davidson can keep his eyes on Jarvis — 
and you can try to keep one eye 
on him." 

"You think it will work, then?" 

"No, but any plan is better 
than no plan. Maybe it will stir 
up something." 

WHILE we headed for Iowa — 
Jarvis, Davidson and I — • 
the Old Man went to Washington. Mary cornered me as we 
were about to leave, grabbed me 
by the ears, kissed me firmly and 
said. "Sam, come back." 

I got all tingly and felt like a 
fifteen-year-old. 

Davidson roaded the car beyond the place where I had found 
a bridge out. I was navigating, 
using a map on ^vhich had been 
pinpointed the landing site of the 



real spaceship. The bridge gave 

a precise reference point. We 
turned off the road two-tenths of 
a mile due east of the site and 
jeeped through the scrub to the 
spot. 

Almost to the spot, I should 
say. We ran into burned-over 
ground and decided to walk. The 
site shown by the Space Station 
photograph was in the brush fire 
area — and there was no 'Flying 
Saucer." It would have taken a 
better detective than I to show 
that one had ever landed. The 
fire had destroyed all traces. 

Jarvis scanned everything, anyhow, but I knew that the slugs 
had won another round. As we 
came out, we ran into an elderly 
fanner. 

"Quite a fire," I remarked, 
keeping a wary distance. 

"Sure was," he said dolefully. 
"Killed two of my best milch 
cows, the poor dumb brutes. You 
fellows reporters?" 

"Yes. but we've been sent on a 
wild goose chase." I wished Mary 
were along. Maybe this character 
was naturally round-shouldered, 
but assuming that the Old Man 
was right about the spaceship — and he had to be right — then this 
too-innocent bumpkin- must know 
about it and was covering up. 
Ergo, he had to be hag-ridden. 

I threw a glance at my teammates. They were alert and Jarvis 
Was scanning.

As the farmer turned, I tripped 
him. He went down with me on 
his back, clawing at his shirt. 
Jarvis moved in and got a closeup. I had his back bare before 
he got his wind. 

And it was bare — no parasite, 
no sign of one, nor any place on 
his body, which 1 made sure of. 

I helped him up and brushed 
him off; his clothes were filthy 
with ashes. "I'm sorry," I said. 

"You young — " He couldn't 
find a word bad enough for me. 
He looked at us and trembled 
with anger. "I'll have the law on 
you. If I were twenty years 
younger, I'd lick all three of you." 

"Believe me, old-timer, it was 
a mistake. 1 " 

"Mistake !" I thought he was 
going to cry. "I come back from 
Omaha and find my place burned, 
half my stock gone, my son-inlaw no place around, strangers 
snooping around my land, and I 
like to get torn to pieces. Mistake! What's the world coming 
to?" 

I thought I could answer that 
last one, but there was no point. 
I tried to pay him for the indignity, but he slapped my money 
to the ground. We tucked in our 
tails and got out. 

When we were rolling again, 
Davidson said, "Are you sure you 
know what you are up to?" 

"I can make a mistake," I said 
savagely, "but have you ever 



known the Old Man to?" 

"Mmm . . . no. Where next?" 

"wues, stereo station. This one 
one won't be a mistake.** 

AT the toll gates into Des 
Moines, the gatekeeper hesitated. He glanced at » notebook 
and then at our plates. "Sheriff 
has a call out for this car," he 
said. "Pull over to the right." 

"Right it is," I agreed, backed 
up thirty feet and gunned her. 
The Section's cars are beefed up 
and hopped up — a good thing, for 
the gate was stout. I did not. slow 
down on the far side. 

"This," said Davidson, "is intt-i esting. Do you still know what 
you are doing?" 

"Cut the chatter," I snapped. 
"Get this, both of you: we aren't 
likely to get out. But we are going to get those pix." 

Ahead of any pursuit, I slammed to a stop in front of the station and we poured out. None of 
"Uncle Charlie's" indirect methods — we swarmed into the first 
elevator and punched for Barnes* 
floor. When we got there I left 
the door of the car open. 

The receptionist tried to stop 
us, but we pushed by. The girls 
looked up, startled. I went 
straight to Barnes' inner door and 
tried it; it was locked. 

I turned to his secretary. 
"Where's Barnes?" 

"Who is calling, please?" she 



THE PUPPET MASTEtS 



said, about as polite as a fish. 

I looked down at her shoulders. Humped. By God, I said to 
myself, this one has to be. She 
Was here when I killed Barnes. 

I bent over and pulled up her 
sweater. 

I was right. I had to be right. 
For the second time I stared at 
one of the parasites. 

She struggled and clawed and 



tried to bite. I judo-cut her neck, 
almost getting my ha,nd in the 
mess, and she went limp. I swung 
her around. 

"Jarvis," I yelled, "get a closeup." 

The idiot was riddling with his 
gear, his big hind end between me 
and the pickup. He straightened. 
"School's out," he said. "Blew a 
tube." 





 



"Replace it. Hurry!" 

A stenographer stood up on the 
other side of the room and fired 
at the scanner. Hit it, too, before 
Davidson burned her down. As 
if it had been a signal, about six 
of them jumped Davidson. They 
did not seem to have guns; they 
just swarmed over him. 

I hung onto the secretary and 
shot from where I was. 1 caught 



a movement out of the corner of 
my eye and turned to find Barnes 
—"Barnes" number two — standing in his doorway. I shot him 
through the chest to get the slug 
I knew was on his back, then returned to the slaughter. 

Davidson was up again. A girl 
crawled toward him; she seemed 
wounded. He shot her in the face 
and she stopped. His next bolt

was just barely past my ear. 

I said, "Thanks! Let's get out 
of here." 

The elevator was open ; we 
rushed in, me still burdened with 
Barnes' secretary. I slammed the 
door and started it. Davidson was 
trembling and Jarvis was white. 

"Buck up," I said. "You 
weren't shooting people, but 
things. Like this." I held the girl 
up and looked down at her back. 

Then I almost collapsed. My 
specimen, the one I had grabbed 
to take back alive, was gone. 
Sliped to the floor, probably, and 
oozed away during the ruckus. 

"Jarvis." I said, "did you get 
anything?" 

He shook his head. 

The girl's back was covered 
with a rash like a million pinpricks, where the thing had ridden 
her. I settled her on the floor 
against the wall of the car. She 
was still unconscious, so we left 
her. There was no interference as 
we went through the lobby to 
the street. 

A policeman had bis foot on 
our car while making out a ticket. 
He handed it to me and said, 
"You can't park in this area, 
Mac.'* 

I said, "Sorry," and signed his 
copy. Then I gunned the car 
away, got as clear as I could of 
traffic — and blasted into the air 
right from a city street. I wondered whether he added that to 



the ticket. When I had her at altitude, I switched license plates 
and identification code. The Old 
Man thinks of everything. 

Only he did not think much of 
me. I tried to report on the way 
in, but he cut me short and ordered us into the Section offices. 
Mary was there with him. 

"How much did you see?" I 
asked when I had finished reporting. 

"Transmission cut off when you 
hit the toll barrier," he informed 
me. "The President was not impressed by what he saw." 

"I suppose not." 

"He told me to fire you." 

I stiffened. "I am perfectly 

will—" 

"Pipe down !" the Old Man 
snapped. "I told him that he 
could fire me, but not my subordinates. You are a thumb-fingered dolt," he went on quietly, 
"but you can't be spared now." 

"Thanks." 

Mary had been wandering 
around the room. She stopped 
back of Jarvis's chair — and gave 
the Old Man the sign she had 
given for Barnes. 

I hit Jarvis in the head with 
my heater and he sagged out of 
his chair. 

"Stand back, Davidson!" the 
Old Man rapped. His gun was out 
and pointed at Davidson's chest. 
"Mary, how about him?" 

"He's all right." 



3' 4 




 



"And him?" 
"Sam's clean." 

The Old Man's eyes moved 
over us and I have never felt 
closer to death. "Peel off your 
shirts," he said sourly. We did. 
Mary was right. I had begun to 
wonder whether I would know it 
if I did have a parasite on me. 
"Now him," the Old Man ordered. "Gloves." 

We stretched Jarvis out and 
carefully cut his clothing away. 
We had our live specimen. 

1" FELT myself ready to retch. 

The thought of that thing 
right behind me all the way from 
Iowa was more than even my unsqueamish stomach could stand. 

I swallowed and said, "Let's 
work it off. Maybe we can still 
save Jarvis.' I did not really think 
so; I had a deep-down hunch 
that anyone who had been ridden 
by one of those things was 
spoiled, permanently. 

The Old Man waved us back. 
"Forget Jarvis." 

"But—" 

"Stow it! If he can be saved, a 
bit longer won't matter. In any 
case — -" He shut up and so did I. 
I knew what he meant. We were 
expendable; the people of the 
United States were not. 

The Old Man. gun drawn and 
wary, continued to watch the 
thing on Jarvis's back. He said 
to Mary, "'Get the President. Spe


cial code zero zero zero seven.** 

Mary went to his desk. I heard 
her talking into the muffler, but 
my own attention was on the 
parasite. It made no move to 
leave Jarvis. 

Presently Mary reported, "I 
can't get him, sir. One of his assistants is on the screen. Mr. McDonough." 

The Old Man winced. McDonough was an intelligent, likable 
man who hadn't changed his 
mind on anything since he was 
housebroken. The President used 
him as a buffer. 

No, the President was not available. No, he could not be reached 
with a message. No, Mr. McDonough was not exceeding his 
authority; the Old Man was not 
on the list of exceptions — if there 
was such a list. Yes, Mr. McDonough would be happy to 
make an appointment; that was 
a promise. Today? Out of the 
question. Tomorrow? Impossible. 
How would next Friday do? 

The Old Man switched off and 
seemed about to have a stroke. 
Then he took two deep breaths, 
his features relaxed, and he said, 
"Dave, ask Doc Graves to step 
in. The rest of you keep your 
distance." 

The head of the biological lab 
came in shortly. "Doc," said the 
Old Man, "there is one that isn't 
dead." 

Graves looked closely at Jar


THE PUPPET MASTERS

vis's back, "Interesting," he said. 
He dropped to one knee. 
"Stand back!" 

Graves looked up. "But I must 
have an opportunity — " 

"I want you to study it, yes, 
but, first, you've got to keep it 
alive. Second, you've got to keep 
it from escaping. Third, you've 
got to protect yourself." 

Graves smiled. "I'm not afraid 
ef it." 

"Be afraid of it ! That's an 
order." 

"I must rig up an incubator to 
care for it after we remove it. 
These things obviously need oxygen — not free oxygen, but oxygen 
from its host. Perhaps a large 
dog would suffice." 

"No," snapped the Old Man. 
"Leave it where it is." 

"What? Is this man a volunteer?" The Old Man did not 
answer. Graves pointed out, "Human laboratory subjects must be 
volunteers. Professional ethics, 
you know." 

"Doctor Graves, every single 
agent in this Section is a volunteer for whatever I find necessary. 
Please carry out my orders." 

After they had carted Jarvis 
away, Davidson and Mary and I 
went to the lounge for a drink or 
four. We needed them. Davidson 
had the shakes. When the first 
drink failed to fix him, I said, 
"Look, Dave, I feel as bad about 
those girls as you do, but it could 



not be helped. Get that through 
your head." 

"How bad was it?" asked Mary. 

"Pretty bad. I don't know how 
many we killed." I turned to 
Davidson. "We weren't shooting 
peoplej we were shooting parasites. Don't you see that?"'' 

"That's just it. They weren't 
human. You shoot and they keep 
coming toward you." 

After a bit, he left. Mary and 
I talked a while, trying for answers and getting nowhere. Then 
she announced that she was 
sleepy and headed for the women's dormitory. The Old Man had 
ordered all hands to sleep in that 
night, so I went to the boys' wing 
and crawled in a sack. 

THE air raid alarm woke me. I 
stumbled into clothes as blowers sighed off; then the intercom 
bawled in the Old Man's voice, 
"Anti-gas and a nti -radiation procedures! Seal everything! All 
hands gather in the conference 
hall. Move.'" 

Being a field agent, I had no 
local duties. I shuffled down the 
tunnel to the offices. The Old 
Man was in the big hall, looking 
grim. I wanted to ask what was 
up, but there were a dozen clerks, 
agents, stenos and such there before me. 

The Old Man sent me out to 
get the door tally from the guard 
on watch. He called the roll and 



36 




 



presently it was clear that every 
person listed on the door tally 
was now inside the hall, from old 
Miss Haines, the Old Man's secretary, down to the steward of the 
lounge — except the door guard 
and Jarvis. The tally had to be 
right; we keep track of who goes 
in and out a bit more carefully 
than a bank keeps track of 
money. 

I was sent out again for the 
door guard. It took a call back 
to the Old Man before he would 
leave his post; he then threw the 
bolt switch and followed me. 
When we got back, Jarvis was 
there, attended by Graves and a 
lab man. He was wrapped in a 
hospital robe, conscious, apparently, but dopy. 

I began to have some notion 
of what it was all about. The Old 
Man was facing the assembled 
staff and keeping his distance; he 
had his gun out. "One of the invading parasites is loose among 
us," he said. "To some of you, 
that means too much. To the rest 
of you, I will have to explain, as 
the safety of all of us — of our 
whole race — depends on complete 
cooperation and utter obedience." 
He went on to explain briefly but 
with ugly exactness what a parasite was, what the situation was. 
"In short," he concluded, "the 
parasite is almost certainly in this 
room. One of us looks human but 
is an automaton, moving at the 



will of our deadliest enemy.** 

People stole glances at each 
other. Some tried to draw away. 
A moment before we had been a 
team; now we were a mob, each 
suspicious of the other. I found 
myself edging away from the man 
closest to me — Ronald, the lounge 
steward, whom I had known for 
years. 

Graves cleared his throat. 
"Chief," he started in, "I took 
every reasonable—" 

"Stow it. Bring Jarvis out in 
front. Take his robe off." 

Graves shut up and he and his 
assistant complied. Jarvis seemed 
only partly aware of his surroundings. Graves must have 
drugged him. 

"Turn him around," the Old 
Man ordered. 

Jarvis let himself be turned ; 
there was the mark of the slug, a 
red rash on shoulders and neck. 
There had been whispers and embarrassed giggles when Jarvis had 
been stripped; now there was a 
dead hush. 

"We are going to get that slug!'* 
said the Old Man. "Furthermore, 
we are going to capture it alive. 
You have all seen where a parasite rides a man. I'm warning 
you; if the parasite gets burned, 
I'll burn the man who did it. If 
you have to shoot to catch it, 
shoot low. Come here!" He 
pointed his gun at me, halted me 
halfway between the crowd and 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



37 



himself. "Graves, sit Jarvis down 
behind me. No, leave his robe 
off." The Old Man turned back 
to me. "Drop your gun on the 
floor." 

The Old Man's gun was 
pointed at my belly; I was very 
careful how I drew mine. I slid 
it six feet away from me. "Take 
off all your clothes," he said. 

The Old Man's gun overcame 
my inhibitions, though it did not 
help to have one of the girls 
whisper, "Not bad!" and another 
reply, "Knobby, I'd say." I 
blushed. 

After he looked me over, the 
Old Man told me to pick up my 
gun. "Back me up," he ordered, 
"and keep an eye on the door. 
You, Dotty Something -or -other 
—you're next." 

Dotty was a girl from the clerical pool. She had no gun, of 
course, and she was dressed in a 
floor -length negligee. She stepped 
forward, stopped. 

"You really mean it?" she said 
incredulously. 

"Move!" 

She almost jumped. "Well! No 
need to take a person's head off." 
She bit her lip as she unfastened 
the clasp at her waist. "I ought 
to get a bonus for this," she said 
defiantly, then threw the robe 
from her. 

"Over against the wall," the 
Old Man said savagely. "Now the 
rest of you.*' 



In twenty minutes there were 
more square yards of gooseflesh 
exposed than I had ever seen before, and the pile of guns looked 
like a small-arms arsenal. 

When Mary's turn came, she 
took her clothes off quickly and 
without a fuss. She made nothing of it, wearing her skin with 
quiet dignity. She added considerably to the pile of hardware. 
I decided she just plain liked 
guns. 

WE were all evidently free of 
parasites, except the Old 
Man and his old-maid secretary. 
I think he was a bit in awe of 
Miss Haines. He looked distressed 
and poked about in the pile of 
clothing with his cane. Finally he 
looked up at her. "Miss Haines — 
if you please." 

I thought to myself, brother, 
this time you are going to have 
to use force. 

She stood there, facing him 
down, a statue of offended modesty. I moved closer and said, 
out of the corner of my mouth, 
"Boss, how about yourself? Suppose you take 'em off." He looked 
startled. "I mean it," I said. "It's 
you or she. Might be either. Out 
of those duds." 

The Old Man can recognize the 
inevitable. He said, "Have her 
stripped." He began fumbling at 
his zippers, looking grim. I told 
Mary to take a couple of women 



36 




 



and peel Miss Haines. When I 
turned back, the Old Man had his 
trousers at half mast — and then 
Miss Haines made a break for it. 

The Old Man was between us 
and I couldn't get in a clean 
shot and every other agent in the 
place was disarmed! I don't think 
it was accident; the Old Man did 
not trust them not to shoot. He 
wanted that slug alive. 

She was out the door and runn ing down the passage by the 
time I got organized. I could 
have winged her in the passageway, but I was inhibited — first, 
I could not shift gears emotionally that fast. I mean to say she 
was still Old Lady Haines, secretary to the boss, the one who 
bawled me out for poor grammar 
in my reports. In the second place, 
if she was carrying a parasite, I 
did not want to risk burning it. 

She ducked into a room. Again 
I hesitated — sheer habit; it was 
the ladies' room. 

But only a moment. I slammed 
the door open and looked around, 
gun ready. 

Something hit me back of my 
right ear. 

T CAN give no clear account of 
the next few moments. I was 
out cold, for a time at least. I remember a struggle and some 
shouts: "Look 'out?" "Damn her, 
she's bitten me!" "Watch your 
hands!" Then somebody quietly, 



"By her hands and feet — careful.** 
Somebody said, "How about 
him?" and someone answered, 
"Later. He's not hurt." 

I was still practically out as 
they left, but I began to feel a 
flood of life stirring back into me. 
I sat up, feeling extreme urgency 
about something. I got to my feet, 
staggering, and went to the door. 
I looked out cautiously; nobody 
was in sight. I trotted down the 
corridor, away from the conference hall. 

At the outer door, I realized 
that I was naked and tore on 
down the hallway to the men's 
wing. There I grabbed the first 
clothes I could find and pulled 
them on. The shoes were much 
too small for me; it did not seem 
to matter. 

I ran back to the exit, found 
the switch. The door opened. 

I thought I had made a clean 
escape, but somebody shouted, 
"Sam!" just as I was making 
my choice of six doors and then 
I plunged on out. At once I had 
three more beyond the one I 
picked. The warren we called the 
"offices" was served by a spaghettilike mess of tunnels. I came 
up finally inside a subway fruitand-bookstall, nodded to the 
proprietor, swung the counter 
gate and mingled with the crowd. 

I caught the up-river jet express and got off at the first station. I crossed over to the down

river, waited around the change 
Window Until a man. came up who 
displayed quite a btt of money 
as he bought his counter. I got 
on the same train and got off 
when he did. At the first dark 
spot I rabbit -punched him. Now 
I had money and was ready to 
operate. I did not know why I 
had to have money, but I knew 
that I needed it for what I was 
about to do. 

T SAW things around me with 
a curious double vision, as if I 
stared through rippling wateryet I felt no surprise and no curiosity. I moved like a sleepwalker, 
unaware of what I was going to 
do, and still I was wide awake, 
aware of who I was, where I was, 
what my job at the Section had 
been. And, although I did not 
know my objective. I was always 
conscious of what I was doing 
and sure that each act was the 
necessary act at that moment. 

I felt no emotion most of the 
time, except the contentment that 
comes from work which needs to 
be done. That was on the conscious level. Someplace, more 
levels down than I understand 
about, I was excruciatingly unhappy, terrified, and filled with 
guilt, but that was down, way 
down, locked, suppressed, I was 
hardly aware x>S it and not affected by it. 

I knew that I had been seen to 



leave. That shout of "Sam!" was 
for me; only two persons knew me 
by that name and the Old Man 
would have used my right name. 
So Mary had seen me leave. \t 
was a good thing, I thought, that 
she had let me find out where 
her apartment was. It would be 
necessary to booby trap it against, 
her using it. In the meantime I 
must get on with work and keep 
from being picked up. 

I was moving through a warehouse district, all my training at 
work to avoid being noticed. 
Shortly I found a satisfactory 
building; there was a sign: loft 

FOR LEASE — SEE RENTAL AGENT ON 

ground floor. I scouted it, noted 
the address, then doubled back 
to a Western Union booth. There 
I took a vacant machine and sent 
this message: expedite two cases 

TINV TOTS TALK TALES SAME DISCOUNT CONSIGNED JOEL FREEMAN 

and added the address of the loft. 
I sent it to Roscoe & Dillard, 
Jobbers and Manufacturers 
Agents, Des Moines, Iowa. 

As I left the booth, the sight of 
one of the Kwikf ede restaurants 
reminded me that I was hungry, 
but the reflex abruptly cut off 
and I thought no more about it. 
I returned to the warehouse, 
found a dark corner in the rear, 
and settled back to wait for dawn 
and business hours. 

I have a dim recollection of 
claustrophobic nightmares.

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



At nine o'clock I met the rental 
agent as he unlocked his office, 
and leased the loft, paying him a 
fat squeeze for immediate possession. I went up to the lpft, unlocked it, and waited. 

About ten-thirty my crates 
were delivered. After the expressmen were gone, I opened a crate, 
took out one cell, warmed it, and 
got it ready. Then I found the 
rental agent again and said, "Mr. 
Greenberg, could you come up 
for a moment? I want to see 
about making some changes in 
the lighting." 

TTE fussed, but did so. When we 
entered the loft -I closed the 
door and led him to the crate. 
"Here," I said, "if you will lean 
over, you will see just what I 
mean." 

I got him with a grip that cut 
off his wind, ripped his jacket 
and shirt up, and, with my free 
hand, transferred a master from 
the cell to his bare back, then 
held him tight until he relaxed. 
I let him up, tucked his shirt in 
and dusted him off. When he 
caught his breath, 1 said, "What 
news from Des Moines?" 

"What do you want to know?" 
he asked. "How long have you 
been out?" 

I started to explain, but he interrupted with, "Let's, have direct 
conference and not -waste time." 
I skinned up my shirt, he did the 



same, and we sat down on the 
unopened crate, back to back, 
so that our masters could be in 
contact. My own mind was blank; 
I have no idea how long it went 
on. I watched a fly droning 
around a dusty cobweb. 

HpHE building superintendent 
was our next recruit. He was 
a large Swede and it took both 
of us. After that Mr. Greenberg 
called up the owner and insisted 
that he had to come down and 
see some damage that had occurred to the structure — - just 
what, 1 don't know; I was busy 
working with the super, opening 
and warming more cells. 

The owner of the building was 
a prize and we all felt pleased, 
including, of course, the man himself. He belonged to the Constitution Club, the membership of 
which read like Who's TVho in 
Finance, Government and Industry. 

It was pushing noon; we had 
no time to lose. The super went 
out to buy clothes and a satchel 
for me, and he sent the owner's 
chauffeur up to be recruited as 
he did so. At twelve-thirty we 
left, the owner and I, in his town 
car; the satchel contained twelve 
masters, in their cells but ready. 

The owner signed /. Hardwick 
Potter 8s Guest A flunky tried 
to take my bag, but I insisted 
that I needed it to change my; 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



shirt before lunch. We stalled 
around in the washroom until we 
had it to ourselves, except for 
the attendant — whereupon we recruited him and sent him with a 
message to the manager that a 
guest was ill in the washroom. 

After we took care of the manager, he obtained a white coat 
and I became another washroom 
attendant. I had only ten masters 
left, but the cases would be picked 
up from the toft and delivered to 
the club shortly. The regular attendant and I used up the rest of 
those I had before the lunch hour 
rush was over. One guest walked 
in on us while we were busy and 
I had to kill him. We stuffed him 
i«to the mop closet,. 

There was a lull after that, as 
the cases had not yet arrived. 
Hunger reflex nearly doubled me 
over ; then it dropped off, but 
persisted. I told the manager, who 
had me served lunch in his office. 
The cases arrived as I was finishing. 

During the drowsy period in 
the mid -afternoon, we secured the 
place. By four o'clock everyone 
i« the building — members, staff, 
a*»d guests — were with us. From 
then on, we processed them in the 
lobby as the doorman passed 
them in. Later in the day the 
manager phoned Des Moines for 
more cases. Our big prize came 
that evening — the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. We saw a 



real victory; the Treasury Department is charged with the 
safety of the President. 

CJOME- days after I was re*^ cruited, I gave the club manager instructions about shipments 
of masters' carrying cells. I was 
fleetingly aware, as I did so, that 
three more ships had landed, but 
my overt knowledge was limited 
to an address in New Orleans. 

I thought nothing about it; I 
went on with my work. I was a 
new "special assistant to Mr. 
Potter" and spent the days in his 
office — and the nights, too. Actually, the relationship may have 
reversed; I frequently gave oral 
instructions to Potter. Or perhaps I understand the social organization of the parasites as little now as I did then. 

Through me. my master knew 
as much as I did. It knew that 
I was one human known to the 
Old Man to have been recruited 
— and knew, I am sure, that the 
Old Man would not cease to 
search for me, to recapture me or 
kill me. 

It seems odd that it did not 
change bodies and kill mine; wc 
had vastly more recruits available 
than we had masters. It could not 
have felt anything parallel to 
human squeamishness, for masters newly delivered from their 
transit cells frequently damaged 
their hosts. We always destroyed 



•2 




 



the host and found a new one. 
On the other hand, would a 
skilled cowhand destroy a welltrained horse in favor of an untried, strange mount? That may 
have been why I was kept hidden 
and used. 

After a time the city was "secured" and my master started 
taking me out on the streets. I 
do not mean that every inhabitant wore a hump — the humans 
were very numerous and the mas


ters still very few — but the key 

positions in the city were held by 
our own recruits, from the cop on 
the corner to the mayor and the 
chief of police, not forgetting 
ward bosses, ministers, board 
members, and any and all in public communication and news. The 
majority continued their usual 
affairs, not only undisturbed by 
the masquerade but unaware ©f 
it. 

Unless, of course, one vt them

happened to be in the way of 
some purpose' of a master, in 
which case he Was disposed of. 

That was when I was allowed 
outside, walked to the uptown 
launching platform and made to 
order a cab. One was lifted to the 
loading ramp and I started to get 
in. But an old gentleman bustled 
up and climbed into it ahead of 
me, 1 ' 

I received an order to dispose 
of him. It was immediately 
countermanded by another telling 
me to go slow and be careful. I 
said. ^'Excuse me, sir, but this 
cab is taken." 

"Quite," the elderly man replied. "I've taken it." 

"You will have to find another." I said reasonably. "May I 
sec your ticket?" 

I had him; the cab carried the 
launching number shown by my 
ticket, but he did not stir. "Where 
are you going?" he demanded. 

"New Orleans," I answered, 
and learned for the first time my 
destination. 

"Then you can drop me off in 
Memphis." 

J shook my head. "It's out of 
my way." 

. "All of fifteen minutes!" He 
seemed to have difficulty controlling his temper. "Driver, explain to this person the public 
conveyance rules." 

The driver stopped picking his 
teeth. "It's nothing to me. 1 pick 



'em up, I take 'em, I drop 'em. 
Settle it yourselves or I'll ask the 
despatcher for another fare." 

I hesitated, not yet having been 
instructed. Then I found myself 
climbing inside. "New Orleans." 
I said, "with a stop at Memphis." 

The driver shrugged and signaled the control tower. The 
other passenger snorted and got 
in after me. 

In the air, he opened his briefcase and spread papers across 
his knees. Watching him with 
disinterest, I found myself shifting position to let me get at my 
gun easily. The man shot out a 
hand, grabbed my wrist. "Not so 
fast, son," he said, and his features broke into the Satanic grin 
of the Old Man himself. 

My reflexes are fast, but I was 
at the disadvantage of having 
everything routed from me to my 
master, passed on by it, and action routed back to me; How 
much delay is that? I don't know. 
As I was drawing. I felt a gun 
against my ribs. "Take it easy." 

With his other hand, he thrust 
something against my side. I felt 
a prick, and then through me 
spread the warm tingle of a jolt 
of "Morpheus" taking hold. I 
made one more attempt to pull 
my gun free and sank forward. 

¥ WAS vaguely aware of voices. 
* Someone was handling me 
roughly and someone else was

saying, "Watch out for that ape!" 
Another voice replied, "It's all 
right; his tendons are cut," to 
which the first retorted, "He's still 
got teeth, hasn't he?" 

Ves, I thought fretfully, and 1/ 
you get close, I'll bite you with 
them. The remark about cut tendons seemed to be true; none of 
my limbs would move, but that 
did not worry me as much as being called an ape. It was a shame 
to call a man names when he 
couldn't protect himself. 

I wept a little and then fell 
into a stupor, until I heard, "Feeling better, son?" 

The Old Man was leaning over 
the end of my bed, staring 
thoughtfully. His chest was bare 
and grizzled. 

"Unh," I said, "pretty good. I 
guess." I started to sit up and 
found I could not. 

The Old Man came around to 
the side. "We can, take those restraints off," he said, fiddling with 
clasps. "Didn't want you hurting 
yourself. There!" 

I sat up, rubbing myself. 

"Now," said the Old Man, 
''how much .do you remember?" 

"Remember?" 

"They caught you. Do you remember anything after the parasite got to you?" 

I felt a sudden wild fear and 
clutched at the bed. "Boss! They 
know where this place is! / told 
them." 



w No, they don't,** he answered 
quietly, "because these aren't the 
offices you remember. I had the 
old ones evacuated. They don't 
know about this hangout — I 
think. So you remember?" 

"Of course I remember. I got 
out of here — I mean out of the 
old offices and went up — " My 
thoughts raced ahead; I had a 
sudden image of holding a live 
master in my bare hand, ready 
to place it on the rental agent. 

I threw up. 

The Old Man said gently, "Go 
ahead." 

"Boss, they're all around. 
They've got the city." 

"I know. Same as Des Moines. 
And Minneapolis, St. Paul, New 
Orleans, and Kansas City. Maybe 
more. I don't know — I can't be 
everywhere." He scowled and 
added, "It's like fighting with 
your feet in a sack. We're losing 
fast. We can't even clamp down 
on the cities we know about." 

"Good God!, Why not?" 

"You should know. Because 
'older and wiser heads' are still 
unconvinced. Because when the 
parasites take over a city, everything goes on as before." 

I stared.,. 

"Never mind," he said gently. 
"You are the first break we've 
had, the first victim to be recaptured alive — and now we find 
you remember what happened. 
That's important. And your para


T H E PUPPET MASTERS 



45 



site is the first one we've managed to capture and keep alive. 
We'll have a chance to—" 

My face must have been a 
mask of terror. The notion that 
my master was still alive and 
might get to me again was more 
than I could stand. 

The Old Man shook me. "Take 
it easy. You are still pretty weak." 

"Where is it?" 

"Eh? The parasite? Don't 
worry about it. It's living off your 
opposite number, a red orangutan, name of Napoleon. It's 
safe." 

"Kill it!" 

"Hardly. We need it alive for 
study." 

I must have gone to pieces, for 
he slapped me. "Take a brace," 
he said. "I hate to bother you 
when you are sick, but I've got 
to. We have to get down on wire 
everything you remember." 

I pulled myself together and 
started making a careful report 
of alt that I could remember. I 
described renting the loft and recruiting my first victim, then how 
we moved on to the Constitution 
Club. The Old Man nodded. 
"Logical. You were a good agent, 
even for them." 

"You don't understand," I objected. "/ didn't do any thinking. 
I knew what was going on, but 
that was all. It was as if — " I 
paused, stuck for words. 

"Never mind. Get on." 



"After we recruited the club 
manager, the rest was easy. We 
took them as they came in and — " 

"Names?" 

"M. C. Greenberg. Thor Hansen, J. Hardwick Potter, his 
chauffeur Jim Wakeley, a little 
guy called 'Jake' who was washroom attendant, but he had to 
be disposed of later — his master 
would not let him take time out 
for necessities. Then there was 
the manager; 1 never did get his 
name." I paused, letting my mind 
run back, trying to make sure 
of each recruit. "Oh, my God!" 

"What is it?* 

"The Assistant Secretary of the 
Treasury!"' 

"You got him?" 

"Yes. The first day. How long 
ago was that? Chief, the Treasury 
Department protects the President!" 

But there was just a hole in 
the air where the Old Man had 
been. 

T WOKE up with my mouth 
* foul, head buzzing, and a sense 
of impending disaster. Nevertheless I felt fine, by comparison. A 
cheerful voice said, "Feeling better?" 

A small brunette creature was 
bending over me. She was a cute 
little bug and I was well enough 
to appreciate the fact, though 
faintly. She was dressed in an 
odd costume, white shorts, a wisp 




 



of stuff that covered her breasts, 
and a sort of metal carapace 
that covered the neck, shoulders 
and spine. 

"Some," I admitted. 

"Mouth taste unpleasant?" 

"Like a mailman's sox." 

She gave me some stuff in a 
glass; it burned a little and 
washed away the bad taste. 

"No," she said, "don*t swallow 
it. 'Pit it out and I'll get you 
water." I obeyed. "I'm Doris 
Marsden," she went on, "your 
dny nurse." 

"Glad to know you, Doris," I 
answered and stared at her. "Say, 
why the burlesque getup? Not 
tijat I don't like it, but you look 
like a refugee from a comic book." 

She giggled. "You'll get used 
to it. I did." 

"I like it. But why?" 

"Old Man's orders." Then I 
knew why, and I started to feel 
worse again. Doris said, "Now 
for supper." She got a tray. 

"I don't want anything to eat.'* 

"Open up," she said firmly, "or 
you'll get it through a tube." 

Between gulps, taken in selfdefense, I managed to choke out, 
"I feel pretty good. One jolt of 
'gyro* and I'll be on my feet." 

"No stimulants," she said flatly, 
still shoveling it in. "Special diet 
and lots of rest, with a sleepy pill 
later." 

"What's wrong with me?" 
"Exhaustion, starvation, and 

THE PUPPET MASTERS 



incipient scurvy. You also had 
scabies and lice, but we got those 
whipped. Now you know — and if 
you tell the doctor, I'll call you 
a liar to your face. Turn over." 

I did so and she started changing dressings. I appeared to be 
spotted with sores. I thought 
about what she had told me and 
tried to remember how I had 
lived under my master. 

"Stop trembling," she said. 
"Having a bad one?" 

"I'm all right," I told her. As 
near as I could recall, I had not 
eaten oftener than every second 
or third day. Bathing? Let me 
see — I hadn't bathed at all! I had 
shaved every day and put on a 
clean shirt, but only because that 
was necessary to the masquerade 
and the master knew it. 

On the other hand, I had never 
taken off my shoes from the time 
I had stolen them until the Old 
Man had recaptured me, and they 
had been too tight to start with. 
1 couldn't even feel my feet. 

1L1KE nurses; they are calm 
and earthy and tolerant. Miss 
Briggs, my night nurse, was not 
the cute job that Doris was; she 
had a face like a horse. She wore 
the same musical comedy rig that 
Doris sported, but she wore it 
with a no-nonsense air and strode 
like a grenadier. Doris, bless her 
heart, jiggled pleasantly when 
she walked. 

47 



Miss Briggs refused me a second sleeping pill when I woke up 
in the night and had the horrors, 
but she did play poker with me 
and skinned me out of half a 
month's pay. I tried to find out 
from her about the President, but 
she wasn't talking. She would not 
admit that she knew anything 
about parasites, Flying Saucers, 
or what not — and she herself 
dressed in a costume that could 
have only one purpose! 

I asked her what the public 
news was, then. She maintained 
that she had been too busy to 
look at a- 'cast. So I asked to have 
a stereo box moved into my room. 
She said I would have to ask the 
doctor; I was on the 'quiet' list. 
I asked when I was going to see 
this so-called doctor. About then 
her call bell sounded and she 
left, 

I fixed her. While she was gone. 
I cold-decked the deal, so that 
she got a pat hand — and then I 
wouldn't bet against her. 

T GOT to sleep and was awakened by Miss Briggs slapping me in the face with a washcloth. She got me ready for breakfast. Then Doris relieved her and 
brought in the tray. While I was 
chomping I tackled her for news 
— with the same score I had made 
with Miss Briggs. Nurses run a 
hospital as" if it were a nursery 
for backward children. 



Davidson came to see me after 
breakfast . * 'He a rd you were 
here," he said. He was wearing 
shorts and nothing else, except 
that his left arm was covered by 
a dressing. 

"More than I've heard," I complained. "What happened to you?" 

"Bee stung me." 

If he didn't want to tell how 
he had gotten burned, that was 
his business. I said, "The Old 
Man was in here yesterday and 
left very suddenly. Seen him 
since?" 

"Yep." 

"Well?" 

"Have the psych boys cleared 
you for classified matters?" 

"Is there any doubt about it?" 

"You're darn tootin' there is. 
Poor old Jarvis never did pull 
out of it." 

I hadn't thought about Jarvis. 
"How is he now?" 

"He isn't. Dropped into a coma 
and died — the day after you left. 
1 mean the day after you were 
captured." Davidson looked me 
over. "You must be tough." 

I did not feel tough. Tears of 
helplessness and frustration welled up again and I blinked them 
back. Davidson pretended not to 
notice and went on, "You should 
have seen the ruckus after you 
gave us the slip. The Old Man 
took out after you, wearing nothing but a gun and a look of grim 
determination. He would have 



44 




 



caught you, but the police picked 
him up and we had to get him 
out of hock." 

I grinned feebly. There was 
something both gallant and silly 
about the Old Man charging out 
to save the world in his birthday 
suit. "Sorry I missed it. What 
else has happened — lately?" 

Davidson looked me over. 
"Wait a minute." He stepped out 
and was gone a short time. When 
he came back, he said, "The Old 
Man says okay. What do you 
Want to know?" 

"Everything! What happened 
yesterday?" 

"That's how I got this." He 
waved his damaged wing at me. 
"I was lucky," he added. "Three 
agents were killed. Quite a fracas." , 

"But how about the President? 
Was he — " 

Doris bustled in. "Oh, there 
you are!" she said to Davidson. 
"I told you to stay in bed. You're 
due at Mercy Hospital right now. 
The ambulance has been waiting 
ten minutes." 

He stood up, grinned, and 
pinched her with his good hand. 
"The party can't start until I get 
there." 

"Well, hurry l" 

"Corning." 

I called out, "Hey! How about 
the President?" 

Davidson looked back over his 
shoulder. "Oh, him? He's all 



right. Not a single scratch.** 
He went on. 

Doris came back a few minutes 
later, fuming. "Patients!" she 
said, like a swear word. "I should 
have had twenty minutes for his 
injection to take hold. So instead 
I had to give it to him when he 
got into the ambulance." 

"injection for what?" 

"Didn't he tell you?" 

"No." 

"Amputation and graft, lower 
left arm." 

"Oh." Well, I thought, / won't 
hear the end of the story from. 
Davidson. Grafting on a new limb 
is a shock. They keep the patient hopped up for at least ten 
days. So I tackled Doris again. 
"How about the Old Man? WaJ 
he wounded?" 

"You talk too much," she answered. "It's time for morning 
nourishment and your nap." She 
produced a glass of milky slop. 

"Speak up, wench, or I'll spill 
it on the floor." 

"The Old Man? You mean thfl 
Chief of Section?" 

"Who else?" 

"He's not on the sick list." Sh« 
crossed her fingers on both hands, 
"I wouldn't want him as a pa-« 
tient!" 

FOR two or three more days I 
was kept in bed and treated 
like a child. I did not care; it waa 
the first real rest I had had in 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



49 



years. The sores got better and 
presently I was encouraged— "required," I should say — to take 
light exercise around the room. 

The Old Man called on me. 
"Well," he said, "still malingering." 

I flushed. "Damn your black, 
chilblained heart,'* I told him. 
"Get me some pants and I'll show 
you who is malingering." 

"Slow down." He took my 
chart and looked it over. "Nurse," 
Ik said, "get this man a pair of 
shorts. I'm restoring him to 
duty." 

Doris faced up to him like a 
banty hen. "You may be the big 
boss, but you can't give orders 
here. The doctor will—" 

"Stow it." he said, "and get 

those drawersl'.' 

She went out, sputtering, and 
came buck with the doctor. The 
Old Man said mildly, "Doc, I 
sent for pants, not for you." 

The medico replied stiffly, "I'll 
thank you not to interfere with 
my patients." 

"He's not your patient. He's going back on duty." 

"If you do not like the way I 
run my department, sir, you may 
have my resignation." 

The Old Miin answered, "I beg 
your pardon. Doctor. Sometimes 
I become too preoccupied to follow correct procedure. Will you 
please do me the favor of examining this patient? If he can be 



restored to duty, it would help 
me to have his services at once." 

The doctor's jaw muscles were 
jumping, but he said, "Certainly, 
sir." He went through a show of 
studying my chart, then tested 
my reflexes. "He needs more recuperation, but you may have 
him. Nurse, fetch clothing for this 
man." 

Clothing consisted of shorts 
nnd shoes. Everybody else was 
dressed the same way, however, 
and it was comforting to see all 
those bare shoulders with no masters clinging to them. I told the 
Old Man so. 

"Best defense we've got," he 
growled, "even if it does make 
the city look like a beach. If we 
don't win this set-to before winter weather, we're licked." 

He stopped at a door with a 

Sign: BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY 

STAY OUT! 

I hung back. "Where are we 
going?" 

"To take a look at your twin, 
the ape with your parasite." 

"That's what I thought. Not for 
me!" I could feel myself tremble. 

"Now. look, son," he said patiniUy. "Get over yom panic' Hie 
b« si way is to face up to" it. I 
know it's hard. I've spent hours 
getting used to the sight." 

"You don't know — you can'r 
know!" I had the shakes so badly 
that I had to clutch the door 
frame.

"I suppose it's different," he 
said slowly, "when you've actually had it. Jarvis — " He broke 
off. 

"You're damn right it's different! You're not going to get 
me in there!" 

"No, I guess not. Well, go on 
back, son, and check in at the 
infirmary." He started into the 
laboratory. 

He had gotten three or four 
steps away before I called out, 
"Boss!" He stopped and turned, 
his face expressionless. "Wait," I 
added. "I'm coming." 

"You don't have to.** 

"I'll do it. It — it just takes a 
while — to get your nerve back." 

AST came alongside him, he 
**• grasped my arm, warmly 
and affectionately, and continued 
to hold it as we walked. We went 
through another locked door and 
into a room conditioned warm 
and moist. The ape was there, 
caged. 

His torso was supported and 
restrained by a strap-metal 
framework. His arms and legs 
hung limply, as if he had no 
control over them. He looked up 
at us with eyes malevolent and 
intelligent; then the fire died out 
and they were merely the eyes of 
a dumb brute in pain. 

"Around to the side," the Old 
Man said. 

I would have hung back, but 



he still had me by the arm. The 
ape followed us with his eyes, 
but his body was held by the 
frame. From the new position I 
could see — 

The thing that had ridden my 
back for an endless time, spoken 
with my mouth, thought with my 
brain. My master. 

"Steady," the Old Man said 
softly. 

I took a couple of deep breaths 
and managed to slow my heart 
down. I made myself stare at it. 

It is not the appearance of a 
parasite which arouses horror, 
nor is it even from knowing what 
they can do — for I felt the horror 
the first time I saw one. before 
I knew what it was. I tried to tell 
the Old Man so. 

He nodded, his eyes on the 
parasite. "It's the same with 
everybody. Unreasoning fear, like 
a bird with a snake. Probably its 
prime weapon." He looked away 
from it, as if too long a sight were 
too much for even his rawhide 
nerves. 

I stuck with him, telling myself that it couldn't harm me. I 
looked away and found the Old 
Man's eyes on me. 

"How about it?" he said. "Getting hardened?" 

"A little. All I want is to kill 
it! I could spend my life killing 
them and killing them." I began 
to shake again. 

The Old Man studied me. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



51 



**Here," he said, and handed me 
his gun. , 

It startled me. I was unarmed, 
having come straight from bed. 
I took it, but looked at him questloningly. 

"You want to kill it. If you 
have to, go ahead. Right now." 

"But — you told me you needed 
this one for study." 

"I do. But jf you feel that you 
need to kill it, to make you a 
whole man again, go ahead." 

"To make me a whole man 
again — " The Old Man knew 
what medicine it would take to 
cure me. I was no longer trembling; the gun was cradled in my 
hand, ready to spit and kill. 
While .this one was alive, I would 
still crouch and tremble in the 
dark. As for others — why, we 
could capture a dozen at the Constitution Club. With this one 
dead, I'd lead the raid myself. 

Breathing rapidly, I raised the 
gun. 

Then T turned and chucked it 
to the Old Man. 

"What happened?" he asked. 

"I don't know. It was enough 
to know that I could." 
■ "I figured it would be." 

I felt warm and relaxed, not 
even angry with the Old Man for 
what he had done. "I know you 
did. damn you. How does it feel 
to be a puppet master?" 

He answered soberly, "Not me. 
The most I ever do is lead a man 



on the path he wants to follow. 
There is the puppet master." 

"Yes," I agreed softly, " 'the 
puppet master.' You think you 
know what you mean, but you 
don't. I hope you never do." 

"I hope so, too," he answered. 

I could look now without trembling. Still staring at it, I said, 
"Boss, when you are through 
with it, promise me that I can 
kill it." 

"It's a promise." 

WE were interrupted by a man 
bustling in. He was dressed 
in shorts and a lab coat; it made 
him look silly. It was not Graves 
—I never saw him again. I imagine the Old Man ate him for 
lunch. 

"Why are you wearing a coat?" 
The Old Man's gun was out and 
menacing. 

The man stared at the gun as 
jf it were a bad joke. ^Why, I 
was working. There is .always a 
chance of splattering one's self. 
Sonne of our solutions are 
rather — " 

"Take it off!" 

The man took his coat off. His 
shoulders didn't have the telltale 
rash. "Take that damned coat 
and burn it," the Old Man told 
him. "Then get back to work." 

The man hurried away, his face 
red, then stopped and said, 
"Chief, are you ready for that, 
uh, procedure?" 




 



"Shortly. I'll let you know." 

He left. The Old Man wearily 
put his gun away. "Post an order," he muttered. "Read it aloud. 
Make them initial it. Tattoo it on 
their narrow little chests. And 
always some smart Aleck thinks 
it doesn't mean him. Scientists!** 

I turned back to my former 
master. It still revolted me, but 
I there was a gusty feeling of dan
ger, too, that was not totally unpteasant. "Boss," I asked, "what 
are you going to do with this 
thing?" 

"I plan to interview it." 

"To what? But how — " 

"No, the ape can't talk. We'll 
have to have a volunteer — a human volunteer." 

WHEN I began to visualize 
what he meant, the horror 
struck me again full force. "You 
can't mean that. You wouldn't 
do that to anybody." 

"It needs to be done and it will 
be done." 

"You won't get any volunteers!" 

"I've got one." 
"You have? Who?" 
"But I don't want to use the 
one I've got. I'm still looking 
for the right person." 

I was disgusted and showed it. 
"If you've got one, you won't 
find another; there can't be two 
people that crazy." 

"Possibly," he agreed. "But I 



still don't want the one I've got 
The interview is a 'must,' son; we 
are fighting with a total lack of 
military intelligence. We don't 
know our enemy, we can't negotiate with him, we don't know 
where he comes from, nor what 
makes him tick. We've got to find 
out; our existence depends on it. 
The only way to talk to these 
things is through a human. So it 
will be done. But I'm sttll looking 
for a volunteer." 

"Don't look at me!" 

"I am looking at you." 

I managed to splutter, "You'rtt 
crazy! I should have killed it 
when I had your gun — I would 
have if I had known why you 
wanted it. But as for volunteering 
to let you put that thing — Nor* 

He ploughed on as if he had 
not heard me, "It has to be a man 
who can take it. - Jarvis wasn't 
stable enough, nor tough enough. 
We know you are." 

"Me? All you know is that I 
lived through it once. I ... I 
couldn't stand it again." 

"You are proved and salted. 
With anyone else, I run more risk 
of losing an agent." 

"Since when did you worry 
about risking an agent?" I said 
bitterly. 

"Always. I am giving you on* 
more chance, son. Are you going 
to do this, knowing that it haa 
to be done and that you stand tht 
best chance of anybody — and can 



THE 'PUPPET MASTERS 



S3 



be of most use to us, because you 
did live through it — or are you 
going to let some other agent risk 
his reason and his life in your 
place?" 

I started to try to explain how 
I felt. I could not stand the 
thought of dying while possessed 
by a parasite. Even worse was 
the prospect of nor dying once 
the slug touched me. But I could 
not find words for it. 

I could feel my face set and 
twitch with tension. "There is a 
limit to what any man can go 
through. I won't do it." 

He turned to the intercom on 
the wall. "Laboratory," he called 
out. "We'll start now. Hurry up!" 

I recognized the voice of the 
man who had walked in on us. 
•"Which subject?" he asked. 

"The original volunteer." 

"The smaller rig?" the voice 
asked doubtfully. 

"Right. Get it in here." 

I started for the door. The Old 
Man snapped, "Where are you 
going?" 

"Out," I snapped back. "I want 
fto part of this." 

He grabbed me and spun me 
■round. "No, you don't. You 
know about these creatures; your 
Hdvice could help." 

"Let go of me." 

"You'll stay," he said savagely, 
•strapped down or free to move! 
I made allowances for your illBess, but I've had enough." 



I was too weary to buck him. 
"You're the boss." 

* I iHE lab people wheeled in a 
sort of chair, more like a Sing 
Sing special than anything eke. 
There were clamps for ankles and 
knees, wrists and elbows. There 
was a canvas corselet to restrain 
the waist and chest, but the back 
was cut away so that the shoulders of the victim would be free. 

They placed it beside the ape's 
cage, then removed the side of 
the cage nearest the chair. The 
ape watched with intent, aware 
eyes, but his limbs still dangled 
helplessly. Nevertheless, I became 
still more disturbed at the cage 
being opened. Only the Old Man's 
threat kept me there. The technicians stood back, apparently 
ready. The outer door opened and 
several people came in. Among 
them was Mary. 

I was caught off balance ; I had 
been wanting to see her and had 
tried several times to get word 
to her through the nurses — but 
they either could not identify her 
or had received instructions. Now 
I saw her under these circumstances. I cursed the Old Man to 
myself. It was no show to bring a 
woman to, even a woman agent. 
There ought to be decent limits 
somewhere. 

Mary looked surprised and 
nodded. I let it go at that ; it was 
no time for small talk. She was 



&4 



GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTIOM 



looking good, though very sober. 
She was dressed in the costume 
tli<- nurses had worn, but she did 
not have the ludicrous helmet 
and back plate. The others present were men, loaded with recording and stereo equipment as well 
as other apparatus. 

"Ready?" inquired the lab 
chief. 

"Get going," answered the Old 
Man. 

Mary walked straight to the 
chair and sat down. Two technicians knelt and started fastening the clamps. I watched in a 
frozen daze. Then I grabbed the 
Old Man, literally threw him 
aside, and I was by the chair, 
kicking the technicians out of the 
way. 

"Mary!" I screamed. "Get up 
from there!" 

The Old Man had his gun on 
me. "Away from her," he ordered. 
"You three— grab him and tie 
him." 

I looked at the gun, then down 
at Mary. She did not move; her 
feet were already bound. She 
simply looked at me with compassionate eyes. 

"Get up, Mary," I said dully. 
"I want to sit down." 

They removed the ch a i r a nd 
brought in a larger one. I could 
not have used hers ; both were 
tailored to size. When they, finished clamping me, I might as 
well have been cast in concrete. 



My back began to itch unbearably, although nothing, as yet, 
had touched it. 

Mary was rio longer in the 
room; I had not seen her leave 
and it did not seem to matter. 
After I had been prepared, the 
Old Man laid a hand on my arm, 
and said quietly, "Thanks, son." 
I did not answer. 

I was not interested enough to 
watch them handle the parasite 
behind my back, even if I had 
been able to turn my head, which 
I couldn't. Once the ape barked 
and screamed and someone 
shouted, "Watch it!" 

There was silence, as if everyone was holding his breath. Then 
something moist touched my neck 
and I fainted. 

WITH the same tingling energy I had experienced before, I came out of the faint, 
realizing I was in a tight spot, 
but warily determined to think 
my way out. I was not afraid; I 
was contemptuous and sure that 
I could outwit them. 

The Old Man said sharply, 
"Can you hear me?" 

I answered, "Quit shouting." 
"Do you remember what we 
are here for?" 

"You want to ask questions. 
What are you waiting for?" 
"What are you?" 
"That's a silly question. I'm 
six feet one, more muscle than 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



55 




brain, and I weigh — " 

"'Not you. You know to whom 
] am talking — you." 

"Guessing games?'* 

The Old Man waited before 
Replying, "It's no good to pretend I don't know what you are." 
| ""Oh, go ahead and pretend.'* 

*You know that I have been 
studying you all the time you 
fcave been living on the body of 
that ape. I know things which 
give me an advantage. One — " 
the Old Man started ticking 



them off — "you can be killed. 
Two, you can be hurt. You don't 
like electric shock and you can't 
stand the heat that even a man. 
can stand. Three, you are helpless without your host. I could 
have you removed and you would 
die. Four, you have no powers 
except those you borrow from 
your host. He is helpless. Try 
your bonds. You must cooperate 
or die!" 

I had already been trying my 
bonds, finding them, as I ex



 




pectcd, impossible to escape. 
This did not worry me. I was 
oddly contented to be back with 
my master, to be free of troubles 
and tensions. My business was 
to serve; the future would take 
care of itself. One ankle strap 
seemed less tight than the other. 
Possibly I might drag my foot 
through it. I checked on the arm, 
clamps. If I relaxed completely— 
An instruction came at once 
or I made a decision; the words 
mean the same, for there was no 
conflict between my master and 



me; we were one. Instruction or 
decision, I knew it was not time 
to risk an escape. I ran my eyes 
around the room, trying to figure 
who was armed. It was my guess 
that only the Old Man was. That 
bettered the chances. 

Somewhere, deep down, was 
that ache of guilt and despair 
never experienced by any but the 
servants of the masters. I was 
much too busy, though, to be 
troubled by it. 

"Well?" the Old Man went on. 
"Do you answer questions or do 
I punish you?" 

"What questions?" I asked. 
"Up to now, you've been talking 
nonsense." 

The Old Man turned to a technician. "Give me the tickler." 

I felt no apprehension, being 
still busy checking my bonds. If 
I could tempt him into placing 
his gun within reach, assuming 
that I could get one arm free, 
then I mightHe reached past my shoulders 
with a rod. I felt a shocking pain. 
The room blacked out as if a 
switch had been thrown. I was 
split apart. For the moment, I 
was masterless. 

The pain left, leaving only 
searing memory behind. Before 
I could think coherently, the 
splitting away had ended and I 
was again safely under the control of my master. But for the 
first and only time in my service 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



to him, I was not myself free of 
worry ; echoes of his own wild 
fear and pain were passed cm to 
me. 

"Well, how did you like the 
taste?" asked the Old Man. 

The panic washed away; I was 
again filled with unworried wellbeing, however wary and watchful. My wrists and ankles, which 
had begun to pain me, stopped 
hurting. "Why did you do that?" 
I asked. "Certainly, you can hurt 
me — but why?" 1 

"Answer my questions." 

"Ask them." 

"What are you?" 

The answer did not come at 
once. As the Old Man reached for 
the rod, I heard myself hurriedly 
saying, "We are the people.** 

"What people?" 

" The only people. We have 
studied you and we know your 
Ways. We — " I stopped suddenly. 

"Keep talking," the Old Man 
said grimly, and gestured with 
the rod. 

"We come," I went on, "to 
bring you — " I wanted**to talk; 
the rod was terrifyingly close. But 
there was some difficulty with 
words. "To bring you peace,," I 
blurted out. 

The Old Man snorted. 

"Peace," I went on, "and contentment — and the joy of — of 
surrender." Surrender was not the 
right word. I struggled the way 
one struggles with a foreign 



language. *The joy," I repeated, 
"of . . . nirvana." The word fitted 
and the master was pleased. I felt 
like a dog being patted for fetching a stick. 

"Let me get this," the Old Man 
said. "You are promising the human race that if we will just sm> 
render, you will take care of us 
and make us happy. Right?''* 

"Exactly!" 

The Old Man thought about 
this while looking past my shoulders. He spat on the floor. "You 
know," he said slowly, "humanity 
has often been offered that bargain. It never worked out worth 
a damn." 

"Try it yourself," I suggested. 
rt It can be done quickly. Then 
you will know." 

He stared this time in my face. 
"Maybe I owe it to somebody to 
try it personally. Maybe I will, 
some day. But right now," he 
went on briskly, "you have questions to answer. Answer quick 
and proper and stay healthy. Be 
slow and I'll step up the current." 

I shrank back, feeling dismay 
and defeat. For a moment, thinking he was going to accept, I bad 
been planning the possibilities of 
escape. 

"Now," he went on, "where do 
you come from?" 

No answer. I felt no urge to 
answer. 

The rod came closer. "Far 
away!" I burst. out. 




 



"That's no news. Where's your 
home base, your own planet?** 
The Old Man waited, then said, 
"I'll have to touch up your memcry." I watched dully, thinking 
nothing. 

"There may be a semantic difficulty/* said an assistant. "Different astronomical concepts/' 

"Why?" asked the Old Man. 
•"That slug knows what his host 
knows; we've proved that." But 
he turned back and started a different tack. "See here, you savvy 
the Solar System. Is your planet 
Inside it or outside?" 

1 hesitated, then answered, "All 
planets are ours." 

The Old Man pulled at his lip. 
"I wonder," he mused, "what you 
mean. Never mind. You can claim 
the whole damned universe, but, 
where do your ships come from?" 

I sat silent, unable to tell him. 

Suddenly he reached behind 
me. I felt one smashing blow. 
"Talk, damn you! What planet? 
Mars? Venus? Jupiter? Saturn? 
Uranus? Neptune? Pluto?" 

As he mentioned them, I briefly 
hw them — though I have never 
been as far off Earth as the Space 
Stations. When he came to the 
fight one, I knew — and the 
thought was instantly snatched 
from me. 

I heard myself saying, "None 
•f them. Our home is much farther away." 

He looked past my shoulders 



and then into my eyes. "I thintt 
you are lying. Maybe you need 
tome juice to keep you honest." 
-No, no!" 

"No harm to try." Slowly he 
thrust the rod behind me. I knew 
the answer again and was about 
to give it, when something froze 
my throat. Then the pain started. 

I was being torn apart. I tried 
to talk, anything to stop the pain 
—but 1 wasn't allowed to. 

Through a blur of pain I saw 
the Old Man's face, shimmering 
»nd floating. "Had enough?" he 
■sked. I started to answer, and 
choked and gagged helplessly, 
dumbly. I saw him reach out 
again with the rod. 

There was, as I had told the 
Old Man, a limit to what a man 
could take, even under a master's 
control. I reached that limit and 
burst into pieces. 

rwiHEY were leaning over me* 
Someone said, "He's coming 
around." 

The Old Man's face was over 
mine. "You all right, son?" he 
asked anxiously. I turned my 
face away. 

"One side, please,** another 
Toice said. "Let me give him the 
injection." The speaker knelt by 
me and gave me a shot. He stood 
op, looked at his hands, then 
wiped them on his shorts. 

Gyro, I thought absently, ot 
something like it. Whatever it 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



was, it was pulling me back together. Shortly I sat up, unassisted. I was still in the cage room, 
directly in front of that damnable 
chair. 

I started to get to my feet. 

The Old Man gave me a hand, 
but I shook him off. 

"Sorry," he answered, then 
snapped, "Jones ! You and Ito 
get the litter. Take him to the 
infirmary. Doc, you go along." 

"Certainly." The man who had 
given me the shot started to take 
my arm. 

I drew back. "Keep your hands 
off me!" 

The doctor looked at the Old 
Man, who shrugged, then motioned them all back. Alone, I 
went through the door and past 
the outer one into the corridor. I 
paused there, looked at my wrists 
and ankles, and decided that I 
might as well go to the infirmary. 
Doris would take care of me and 
then maybe I could sleep. I felt 
as if I had gone fifteen rounds 
and lost them all. 

"Sam! Sam!" 

I knew that voice. Mary hurried up and was standing before 
me, looking at me with great 
sorrowful eyes. ''Oh, Sam! What 
have they done to you ?" Her 
voice was so choked that I could 
hardly understand her. 

"You should know," I answered and had strength enough 
left to slap her, "Bitch!" 



*]1/I~Y room was still unoccupied, 
but I did not find Doris. 1 
closed the door, then lay face 
down on the bed and tried to stop 
thinking or feeling. Presently X 
heard a gasp, and opened one 
eye. 

There was Doris. I felt her 
gentle hands on me. "Why, you 
poor, poor baby! Stay there, don't 
move now. I'll hurry right out 
and get the doctor." 

"No." 

"But you've got to have the 
doctor." 

"I won't see him. You help 
me." 

She did not answer. I heard 
her go out. She came back shortly 
— I think it was shortly — and 
started to bathe my wounds. I 
wanted to scream when she 
touched my back. But she dressed 
it quickly and said, "Over easy, 
now." 

"I'll stay face down.** 
"No. I want you to drink something. That's a good boy." 

I turned over, with her doing 
most of the work, and drank what 
she gave me. After a bit I went 
to sleep. 

I seem to remember being 
awakened, seeing the Old Man 
and cursing him. The doctor was 
there, too. Or the whole thing 
could have been a dream. 

Miss Briggs woke me and Doris 
brought me breakfast; it was as 
if I had never been off the sick 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



list. I was not in too bad shape 
though I felt as if I had gone over 
Niagara Falls in a barrel. There 
were dressings on both arms and 
both legs where 1^ had cut myself on the clamps, but no bones 
were broken. Where I was sick 
was in my soul. 

Don't misunderstand me. The 
Old Man could send me into a 
dangerous spot. That was what 
1 had signed up for. But I had 
not signed up for what he had 
done to me. He knew what made 
me tick and he had used it to 
force me into something I would 
never have done willingly. 

Jt was the Old Man that really 
hurt. Mary? There have always 
been female spies, and the young 
and pretty ones have always used 
the same tools. But she should 
not have agreed to use them 
against a fellow agent — at least, 
she should not have used them 
against me. 

Not very logical, is it? Tt was 
to me. They could go ahead with 
Operation Parasite without me. 
I owned a cabin in the Adirondacks; I had stuff there in deep 
freeze to carry me a year, maybe 
more. I had plenty of tempus 
pills; I would go up there and 
use them — and the world could 
save itself, or go to hell, without 
me. 

If anyone came within a hundred yards, he would either show 
a bare back or be burned down. 



T HAD to tell somebody about 
■* the deal I'd gotten, and only 
Doris was handy. She was indignant. Indignant? She was as sore 
as a boiled owl. Being a nurse, 
she had dressed a lot worse than 
what they had done to me. but 
this had been done by our own 
people. I blurted out how I felt 
about Mary's purt in it. 

"Do I understand that you had 
wanted to marry this girl?" 

"Correct. Stupid, ain't I?" 

"Then she knew what she could 
do to you. It wasn't fair." She 
stopped massaging me, her eyes 
snapping. "I've never met your 
redhead, but if I do, I'll scratch 
her face!" 

I smiled wanly at her. "You're 
a good kid. Doris. I believe you 
would play fair with a man." 

"Oh. I've pulled some fast ones. 
But if I did anything halfway 
like that, I'd have to break every 
mirror I own." 

Mary showed up. The first I 
knew was hearing Doris say angrily. "You can't come in." 

Mary's voice answered, "I'm 
going in." 

"Get back or I'll pull that 
hennaed hair out by the roots!" 

There were sounds of a scuffle 
and the smack of someone getting slapped. I yelled, "Hey! 
What goes on?" 

They appeared in the doorway 
'together. Doris was breathing 
hard and her hair was mussed. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



41 



Mary managed to look dignified, 
but there was a bright red patch 
on her cheek just about the size 
of Doris's hand. 

Doris caught her breath and 
said, "You get out; He doesn't 
want to see you." 

Mary said, "I'll hear that from 
him." 

I looked at them both. "Oh, 
what the hell, she's here and I've 
got some things to tell her. 
Thanks for trying, Doris." 

Doris said, "You're a fool," 
and flounced out. 

Mary came ower to the bed. 
"Sam," she said. "Sam." 

"My name isn't Sam." 

"I've never known your right 
name." 

It was no time to explain that 
my parents had burdened me 
with Elihu. I answered, 'What of 
it? Sam will do.' 

"Sam," she repeated. "Oh, Sam, 
my dear." 

"I am not your dear." 

She inclined her head. "Yes, I 
know. I don't know why. Sam, 
I came to find out why you hate 
me. Perhaps I can't change it, 
but I must know." 

I made a sound of disgust. 
"After what you did. you don't 
know why? Mary, you may be a 
cold fish, but you aren't stupid." 

She shook her head. "Just the 
reverse, Sam. I'm not cold, but 
I'm frequently stupid. Look at 
me, please — I know what they 



did to you. I know that you let 
it be done to save me from it. I 
know and I'm deeply grateful. 
But I don't know why you hate 
me. I did not ask you to do it 
and I did not want you to do it." 

I reared up on one elbow. "You 
sat down in that trick chair know- \ 
ing that I would never let you go 
through with it. You knew that, 
whether your devious female 
mind admitted it or not. The Old 
Man could not have forced me 
to with a gun, not even with 
drugs. You could. You did." 

She grew steadily paler, until 
her face was almost green against 
her hair. "Sam, that is not the 
way it was. I didn't know you 
were going to be there. I was terribly startled. But I had to go 
through with it; I had promised." 

"That covers everything. A 
schoolgirl promise." 

"No. Sam. Not a schoolgirl 
promise." 

"It doesn't matter whether you 
are telling the truth about knowing that I would be in there. The 
point is that you were there and / 
was there — and you could figure 
what would happen if you did 
what you did." 

"That's the way it looks to you 
and I can't dispute the facts." 

"Hardly." 

She stood very still for a long 
time. I let her. Finally she said, 
"Sam, once you said something 
alK>ut wanting to marry me.** 




 



"That was another day.*' 
**I didn't expect you to repeat 
the offer. But there was a sort 
of corollary. No matter what you 
think of me, I want to tell you 
that I am deeply grateful for 
what you did for me. Miss Barkis 
is willing, Sam. You understand 
me?" 

I grinned at her. "So help me, 
the workings of the female mind 
delight and astound me. You always think you can cancel anything at all with that one trump 
play." I continued to grin while 
she turned red. "I won't inconvenience you by taking up your 
generous offer." 

She came back at me in a 
steady voice. "I let myself in for 
that. Nevertheless, I meant it. 
That or anything else I can ever 
do for you." 

I sank back and lay down. 
"Sure, you can do something for 
me." 

Her face lit up. "What?" 
"Quit bothering me. Go away. 
I'm tired." 

npHE Old Man put his head in 
late that afternoon. "[ want 
to lalk to you," he started in. 

"/ don't want to talk to you. 
Get out." 

" r ignored it and came in. 
"Mind if I sit?" 

"You seem to be doing so." 

He ignored that, too. "You 
know, son, you are one of my best 



boys, but sometimes you are 
hasty." 

"Don't let that worry you," I 
answered. "As soon as the doctor 
lets me up, I'm through." 

He was not hearing anything ■. 
that he did not choose to hear. 
"You jump to conclusions. Now 
take this girl Mary — " 

"You take her." 

"You jumped all over her without knowing the score. You've got 
her all upset. Why, you may 
have ruined a good agent for me." 

"Look, I'm weeping for both of 
you." 

"You think she let herself be 
used as bait. Well, you've got it 
slightly wrong. She was being 
used, but / was using her. I planned it that way." 

"I know you did.*' 

"Then why blame her?" 

"Because you couldn't have 
carried it out without her cooperation. It's big of you, you nogood, heartless bastard, to take 
all the blame — but you can't." 

He did not hear my profanity, 
either. '"You understand everything but the key point, which is 
that the girl didn't know." 

"Hell's bells, she was there!" 

"So she was. Son, did I ever lie 
to you?" 

"No," I admitted, "but I don't 
think you would hesitate." 

He answered, "Maybe I deserve that. You'll just have to 
test it for yourself and make up

your mind whether or not I'm 
lying. That girl didn't know you 
were going to be in that room. 
She didn't have the faintest suspicion that I didn't mean for her 
to go through with it, or that I 
had already decided that you 
Were the only party who would 
suit me, even if I had to have 
you tied down and forced — which 
I would have done, if I hadn't 
had a double whammy up my 
sleeve to trick you into volunteering. Hell's bells yourself, son; 
she didn't even know you were 
off the sick list." 

I wanted to believe it, so I did 
my damnedest not to. 

"Look at me!" he added. "There 
is something I want to rub into 
your scalp. First off, everybody 
—including me — appreciates what 
you did, regardless of motives. 
I'm putting in a letter and no 
doubt you'll get a medal. That 
stands whether you stay with the 
Section or not. But don't give 
yourself airs as a little tin hero — ** 

"I won't!" 

** — because that medal is going 
to the wrong person. Mary ought 
to get it. Now shut up. I'm not 
through. You had to be forced 
into it. No criticism ; you had 
been through plenty. But Mary 
was a real. Simon-pure volunteer. 
.When she sat down in that chair, 
she didn't expect any last minute 
reprieve and she had every reason to believe that, if she got up 




alive, her mind would be gone, 
which is worse. What I'm trying 
to tell you is — this one is more of 
a man than you are and you've 
done her a serious wrong.** 

I was so churned up that I 
could not judge whether he was 
telling the truth, or manipulating 
me again. I said, "Maybe I lashed 
out at the wrong person. But if 
what you say is true—* 

"It is 
**— it doesn't make what you 
did any sweeter. I£ niakes it 
worse.** 

He took it without flinching. 
"Son, I'm sorry if I've lost your 
respect. But I can't be choosy 
any more than a commander can 
in battle. Less, because I iigtu. 
with different weapons. I've always been able to shoot my own 
dog. Maybe that's bad, but that

ever in my shoes, you'll have to 

do it, too." 

"I'm not likely to be.** 

"Why don't you rest up and 

think about it?" 

"I'll take leave — terminal 

leave." 

"Very well." He started to 
leave. 

I said, "You made me one 
promise and I'm holding you to 
it. About that parasite — you said 
I could kill it, personally. Are 
you through with it?** 



"Yes, but—" 

I started to get up. "No buts. 
Give me your gun; I'll do it now." 

"You can't. It's already dead." 

"What! You promised me." 

"I know. But it died while we 
were trying to force you— force it 
— to talk." 

I started to shake with laughter 
and could not stop. 

The Old Man shook me. "Snap 
out of it! Fm sorry about what 
I did, but there's nothing to laugh 
at"

"Sure there is , w I answered, 
sobbing and chuckling. "It's the 
funniest thing that ever happened. 
All that for nothing. You dirtied 
yourself and you loused up me 
and Mary — and all for no use." 

"What gave you that idea?" 

"You didn't even get small 
change out of it — out of us. You 
didn't learn anything you didn't 
know before.*' 

"It was a bigger success than 
you'd ever guess, son. True, we 
didn't squeeze anything out of it 
directly, before it died, but we 
got something out of you.'* 

"Me?" 

"Last night. We put you 
through it last night. You were 
doped, psyched, brain-waved, 
analyzed, wrung out and hung 
out to dry. The parasite spilled 
things to you and they were still 
there for the hypno- analysts to 
pick up after you were free of it." 

"What, for instance?" 

"We know where they come 
from and can light back — Titan, 
sixth satellite of Saturn." 

When he said it, I felt a gagging constriction of my throat and 
I knew that he was right. 

"You certainly fought 1 - before 
we could get it," he went on reminisccntly. "We had to hold you 
down to keep you from hurting 
yourself — more." 



He threw his game leg over the 
edge of the bed and struck a 
cigarette. He seemed anxious to 
be friendly. As for me, I did not 
want to fight with him; my head 
was spinning and I had things to 
get straight. Titan, That was a 
long wa^ out in space. Mars was 
the farthest men had ever been, 
unless the Seagraves Expedition, 
the one that never came back, had 
reached the Jovian moons. 

Still, we could get all the way 
to Saturn if we wanted to. 

Finally he got up to go. He had 
limped to the door when I stopped him. "Dad — " 

I had not called him that in 
years. He turned, his expression 
surprised and defenseless. "Yes, 
son?" 

"Why did you and Mother 
name me Elihu?" 

"Eh? Why, it was your maternal grandfather's name." 

"Not enough reason, I'd say." 

"Perhaps not." He turned and 
again I stopped him. 

"Dad, what sort of a person 
was my mother?" 

"Your mother? I don't know 
exactly how to tell you. Well — 
she was pretty much like Mary. 
Yes, son, a great deal like her." 
He stumped out without giving 
me further chance to talk.
