Annual 



Report 



AS AN investor in GALAXY 
Science Fiction to the ex/ m tent of buying it, you arc 
naturally entitled to our first fiscal statement to stockholders. 

• Stories. In. twelve consecutive 
issues, this magazine has presented well over 750,000 words, 
chosen from considerably more 
than 25,000,000, which reduces to 
about five dozen stories selected 
from something like 3,000. It is 
doubtful if any other science fiction magazine has had as many 
manuscripts submitted to it in 
the same space of time. 

• Reader Reaction. All stories 
were liked by some and disliked 
by others. Every story, however, 
was liked more than it was disliked. None was universally approved, which sounds bad but 
isn't — you may remember that 
Mark Twain had to visit a friend 
in the poor house, a publisher 
who put out a newspaper that 
everybody agreed with. 

Unless a science fiction magazine has an arrogant editor, or is 
committed to a specific type of 
story, it must use a variety of 
themes. Some of them will, of 
course, be your favorites, a few 
you tolerate, and others you don't 
care for at all. What many readers seem not to realize is that this 



is true of editors also. 

But it would be foolish to mention my own preferences. In the 
first place, I would be swamped 
with those themes; in the second, 
my preferences are less important than the editorial balance of 
the magazine; and, finally, readers in general are tolerant enough 
to know that themes they did not 
enjoy would be enjoyed by other 
readers. As long as they find 
more pie asur able than unpleas urable .stories in each issue, they 
will continue to support 
. 

• Letters. The habitually nonparticipating fans, after an unprecedented mail response to the 
first half dozen issues, have 
abandoned the field to the active 
fans. These, for all their valuable 
support, create confusion with 
their special demands. It would 
be a great help to have the usually inactive fans clarify matters 
with a renewed flood of letters. A 
specific point is that, with the 
completion of our first year, this 
page is readying the readers' story 
ratings for Vol. 2. You'll want 
your vote counted, surely. 

• Production, At one point, we 
ran into the paper shortage and 
really had to scrounge to put out 
the magazine. In this we had 



ANNUAL REPORT 



some very distinguished publishing company, including big and 
powerful book and magazine 
houses. We now have a long-term 
contract and are assured of uninterrupted production. However, 
we have to make up delayed issues — though none, if you'll notice, was skipped — a few days or 
a week at a time. En about two 
or three months, we will hold to 
the 15th as a deadline. 

There may be some temporary 
difficulties until we have our 
presswork problems ironed out. 
Just to complicate things for ourselves and our new printer, we 
sic, in the meantime, trying a 
layout technique gorily termed a 
gutter bleed. The two inside margins connecting facing pages are 
called the gutter in printing, and 
a bleed is the carrying of an illustration all the way to the edge of 
the page. You've seen it used in 
slick magazines, but never in science fiction. The result will be 
more attractive makeup, once we 
get it fully under control. 

Also, notice the change of type? 
It is bolder, rounder, and more 
readable. Its name is Bookman, 
and it is one of the handsomest 
type faces available today. 
* Distribution. A magazine's biggest headache. So many titles arc 
published that the newsstand has 
become a battleground. But a 
science fiction magazine has one 
enormous advantage — its readers, 



acting as unofficial salesmen, 
hound dealers into giving the 
books display. Then, again, when 
copies are hard to find in some 
towns, readers let us know and 
we can order American News to 
correct the situation. This works 
to your advantage, because the 
more we sell, the more improvements we can introduce. And if 
that's not enough, the neighborly 
help wins our overwhelming gratitude. 

To recapitulate, GALAXY has 
shown a steady increase of 5% a 
month from the first issue. When 
the price was raised to 35c with 
the May issue, there was a 7% 
drop, but the succeeding issues 
are quickly making up the temporary decline. In other words, 
GALAXY is solidly established 
and well over on the black side 
of the ledger. That, for a magazine only a year old, is a remarkable accomplishment, which 
could not have been achieved 
without superior .quality — and, 
equally important, the enthusiastic support of readers. 
• Subscriptions. According to the 
best available information, GALAXY has several times as many 
subs as any other science fiction 
magazine? So many, in fact, that 
we have had to turn this end of 
the business over to a mailing 
house, being unable to handle it 
ourselves. There have been some 
errors, which we are anxious to 



2 




 



correct. If you've had any difficulty, please let us know immediately, and include all possible information. 

• Raw Materials. The best authors and artists are submitting 
their best work to us in enormous 
quantity, thus guaranteeing that 
the quality of GALAXY will be 
maintained and even improved. 
In the changeover from one printer to another, there has been a 



delay in reporting on stories. Any 
authors who have been inconvenienced by this may be assured 
that it is not our standard prac* 
tice. 

• Dividends. Out of the 60 stories in GALAXY this past year, 
more than 30 are scheduled for 
anthologization, which indicates € 
high quality of product.. 

All in all, it's been a fine year.

The 

PuppetMasters 

By ROBERT A. HEINLEIN 

Illustrated by Don Sibley 



FOR mc it started too early 
on July 12, 2007, with my 
phone shrilling. The sort of 
phone my section uses is not 
standard; the audio relay was 
buried surgically under the skin 
back of my left ear — bone conduction, and skull lifting. 

"All right," I growled. "I hear 



you. Shut off that damned noise.** 
"Emergency," a voice said in 
my ear. "Report in person to the 
Old Man. At once." 

"Moving." I acknowledged and 
sat up with a jerk that hurt my 
eyeballs. I went into the bath, 
injected a grain of "Gyro" into 
my arm, then let the vibro exer

cise machine shake me apart 
while the drug put me together. I 
stepped out a new man, or at 
least a good mockup of one, and 
got my jacket. 

There is one thing no head of 
a country can know and that is: 
how good is his intelligence system? He finds out only by having 
it fail him. Hence our section. 
Security suspenders and belt, you 
might say. United Nations had 
never heard of us, nor had Central Intelligence — I think. All I 
really knew about us was the 
training I had received and the 
jobs the Old Man sent me on. 
Interesting jobs if you don't care 
where you sleep, what you eat, 
nor how Jong you live. If I had 
had any sense. I'd have quit and 
taken a regular job. 

The only trouble with that 
would be that I wouldn't have 
been working for the Old Man 
any longer. That made the difference. 

Not that he was a soft boss. 
Hr was capable of saying, "Boys, 
we need to fertilize this tree. 
Jump in that hole at its base and 
I'll cover you up." 

We'd have done it. Any of us 
would. And the Old Man would 
bury us alive, too, if he thought 
there was a 53% probability that 
it was the Tree of Liberty he was 
nourishing. 

He got up and limped toward 
me as I came into our section 



offices through a washroom booth 
in MacArthur Station. His face 
split in a wicked smile. His big 
hairless skull and his strong 
Roman nose made him look like 
a cross between Satan and 
Punch's Judy. "Welcome, Sam,'* 
he said. "Sorry to get you out of 
bed." 

The deuce he was sorry! "1 was 
on'leave," I answered shortly. 

"Ah, but you still are. We're 
going on a vacation." 

"So my name is 'Sam'," I answered, deliberately ignoring his 
"vacation" crack. "What's my 
last name?" 

"Cavanaugh. And I'm your 
Uncle Charlie— Charles M. Cavanaugh, retired. Meet your sister 
Mary." 

I had been aware that there 
was another person in the room, 
but when the Old Man is present 
he gets full attention as long as he 
wants it. Now I looked over my 
"sister" and then looked her over 
again. It was worth it. 

I could see why he had set us 
up as brother and sister if we 
were to do a job together; it 
would give him a trouble-free 
pattern. An indoctrinated agent 
can't break his assumed character 
any more than a professional actor can intentionally muff his 
lines. So this one I must treat as 
my sister — a dirty trick if I ever 
met one I

ingty mammalian. Good legs. 
Broad shoulders for a woman. 
Fleming, wavy red hair and the 
real red -headed saurian bony 
structure to her skull. Her face 
was handsome rather than beautiful; she looked me over as if I 
were a piece of furniture. 

I wanted to drop one wing and 
run in circles. It must have 
showed, for the Old Man said 
gently. "Tut, tut, Sammy. Your 
sister dotes on you and you are 
extremely fond of her, but in a 
healthy, clean-cut, sickeningly 
chivalrous, All - American - Boy 
way." 

"As bad as that?" I asked. 
"Worse." 

"Oh, well — Howdy, Sis." 

She stuck out a hand. It was 
firm and seemed as strong as 
mine. "Hi, Bud." Her voice was 
deep contralto, which was all I 
needed. Damn the Old Man! 

"T might add." he went on, 
"that you are so devoted to Mary 
that you would gladly die to protect her. I dislike telling you so, 
Sammy, but your sister is a 
leette more valuable — for the 
present, at least — to the organization than you are." 

"Got it." I acknowledged. 
"Thanks for the qualification." 

"Now, Sammy — " 

"She's my favorite sister; I 
protect her from dogs and strange 
men. All right, when do we 
start?" 



"Better stop over in Cosmetics. 
They have a new face for you." 

"Make it a whole new head. 
See you. 'By, Sis." 

rpHEY did not quite do that, 
but they did fit my phOne 
under the back of my skull and 
then cement hair over it. They 
dyed my hair to the same shade 
as that of my newly acquired 
sister, bleached my skin, and did 
things to my cheekbones and 
chin. The mirror showed me to 
be as good a redhead as Sis. I 
looked at my hair and tried to 
recall what its natural shade had 
been, way back when. Then E 
wondered about Sis. I hoped she 
was what she seemed to be. 

I put on the kit they gave me 
and somebody handed me a jump 
bag already packed. 

The Old Man had been in Cosmetics, too; his skull was now 
covered by crisp curls of a shade 
between pink and white. They 
had done something to his face, 
I could not tell just what — but 
we were all three clearly related 
by blood and of that curious subrace, the redheads. 

"Come, Sammy," he said. "I'll 
brief you in the car." We went 
by a route I had not known about 
and ended up on the Northside 
launching platform, high above 
New Brooklyn and overlooking 
the ruins of Manhattan Crater. 

J. drove while the Old Man 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



talked. Once we were out of local 
control, he told me to set it automatic on Des Moines, Iowa. I 
then joined Mary and "Uncle 
Charlie" in the lounge. He gave 
us our personal histories up to 
date. "So here we are," he concluded, "a merry family party — 
tourists. And if we should happen 
to run into unusual events, that 
is how we will behave, as nosy 
end irresponsible tourists." 

"But what is the problem?" I 
asked. "Or do we play this one 
by ear?" 

"Possibly." 

"Okay. But when you're dead, 
it's nice to know why. Eh, 
Mary?" 

"Mary" did not answer. She 
had that quality, rare in babes, 
of not talking when she had nothing to say. 

"Sam, you've heard of 'Flying 
Saucers'.'' the Old Man said. 

"Huh?" 

"You've studied history." 

"You mean those? The Flying 
Saucer craze, way back before 
the Disorders? I thought you 
meant something recent and real; 
those were mass hallucinations." 

"Were they?" 

"Well, I haven't studied much 
statistical abnormal psychology, 
but I seem to remember an equation. That whole period was 
psychopathic; a man with all his 
gaskets tight would have been 
locked up." 



"Whereas this present day is 
sane, eh?" 

"I wouldn't go so far as to say 
that." I pawed back through my 
mind and found the answer I 
wanted. "I remember that equation now — Digby's evaluating 
integral for second and high<r 
order data. It gave a 93.7 percent 
certainty that the Flying Saucer 
myth, after elimination of explained cases, was hallucination. 
I remember it because it was the 
first case of its type in which the 
instances had been systematically 
collected and evaluated. A government project, though God 
knows why." 

The Old Man looked benign. 
"Brace yourself, Sammy. We are 
going to inspect a Flying Saucer 
today. Maybe we'll even saw off 
a souvenir, like true tourists." 

"OEVENTEEN hours," the Old 
Man glanced at his finger 
watch and added, "and twentythree minutes ago, an unidentified spaceship landed near Grinnell, Iowa; Type unknown. Approximately disc-shaped and 
about one hundred and fifty feet 
across. Origin unknown, but — " 

"Didn't they track a trajectory 
on it?" I interrupted. 

"They did not," he answered. 
"Here is a photo of it taken by 
Space Station Beta after landing." 

I looked it over and passed it 



5 




 



to Mary. It was as unsatisfactory 
Bb ;i telephoto taken from five 
thousand miles out usually is. 
Trees looking like moss ... a 
cloud shadow that loused up the 
best part of the pic . . . and a 
gray circle that might have been 
a disc-shaped ship and could just 
as well have been an oil tank or 
a water reservoir. 

Mary handed the pic back. I 
said, "What else do we know?" 

"Nothing." 

"Nothing? After seventeen 
hours? We ought to have agents 
pouring out of their ears!" 

"We did have. Two within 
reach and four that were sent in. 
They failed to report back. I dislike losing agents, Sammy, especially with no results." 

I had a sudden cold realization 
that the situation must be 
damned serious. The Old, Man 
had chosen to bet his own brain 
against the loss of the organization — for he was the Section. I 
suddenly felt chilly. Ordinarily, 
an agent has a duty to save his 
own neck, in order to complete 
his mission and report back. On 
this job it was the Old Man who 
must come back, and, after him, 
Mary. I was as expendable as a 
paper clip. 

"One agent made a partial report," the Old Man went on. "He 
went in as a casual bystander and 
reported by phone that it must 
be a spaceship. He then reported 



that the ship was opening and 
that he was going to try to get 
closer, past the police lines. The 
last thing he said was, 'Here they 
come. They are little creatures, 
about — ' Then he shut off." 
"Little men?" 

" 'Creatures' was what he said.** 

"Peripheral reports?" 

"Plenty. The Des Moines 
stereocasting station sent mobile 
units in for spot cast. The pictures they sent out were all long 
shots, taken from the air. They 
showed nothing but a disc -shaped 
object. Then, for about two hours, 
no pictures and no news, followed 
later by closeups and a new hews 
s.lant." 

I said, "Well?" 

"The thing was a hoax. The 
'spaceship' was a sheet metal and 
plastic fraud, built by two farm 
boys, in woods near their home. 
The fake reports originated with 
an announcer who had put the 
boys up to it to make a story. He 
has been fired and the latest 'invasion from outer space' turns 
out to be a gag." 

"A hoax — but we lose six men. 
We going to look for them?" 

"No. We would not find them. 
We are going to try to figure out 
why triangulation of this photograph — " he held up the teleshot 
taken from the Space Station — 
"doesn't quite jibe with the news 
reports, and why Des Moines 
stereo shut down for a while.** 



THE PUPPET MASTERS

Mary spoke up for the first 
time. "I'd like to talk with those 
farm boys." 

IROADED the car five miles 
this side of Gri.nn.ell and we 
started looking for the McLain 
farm — the news reports had 
named Vincent and George McLain as the culprits. It wasn't 
hard to find. At a fork in the road 
was a big sign: this way TO THE 
spaceship. Shortly the road was 
parked both sides with duos and 
groundcars and triphibs. A couple 
of stands dispensed cold drinks 
and souvenirs at the turnoff into 
the McLain place. A state cop 
was directing traffic. 

"Pull up." directed the Old 
Man. "Might as well see the fun, 
eh?" 

'■Right, Uncle Charlie," I 
agreed. 

The Old Man bounced out, 
swinging his cane. I handed Mary 
out and she snuggled up to me, 
grasping my arm. She looked up 
at me, managing to look both 
stupid and demure. ''My, but 
you're strong, Buddy." 

I wanted to slap her. That 
poor-little-me routine from one 
of the Old Man's agents — a smile 
from a tiger. 

"Uncle Charlie" buzzed around, 
bothering state police, buttonholing people, stopping to buy cigars 
at a stand, and giving a picture 
of a well-to-do, senile old fool, 



out for a holiday. He turned and 
waved his cigar at a state sergeant. "The inspector says it is a 
fraud, my dears — a prank 
thought up by boys. Shall we 
go?" 

Mary looked disappointed. "No 
spaceship?" 

"There's a spaceship, if you 
want to call it that," the cop answered. "Just follow the suckers. 
It's sergeant, not inspector." 

We set out, across a pasture 
and into some woods. It cost a 
dollar to get through the gate and 
many turned back. The path 
through the woods was rather 
deserted. I moved carefully, wishing for eyes in the back of my 
head instead of a phone. Uncle 
Charlie aad Sis walked ahead, 
Mary chattering like a fool and 
somehow appearing to be both 
shorter and younger than she had 
been on the trip out. We came to 
a clearing and there was the 
"spaceship." 

rt was more than a hundred 
feet across, but it was whipped 
together out of light-gauge metal 
and sheet plastic, sprayed with 
aluminum. It was the shape of 
two pie plates, face to face. Aside 
from that, it looked like nothing 
in particular. Nevertheless, Mary 
squealed, "Oh, how exciting!" 

A youngster, eighteen or nineteen, with a permanent sunburn 
and a pimply face, stuck his hrnd 
out of a hatch in the top of the 



10 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



monstrosity. "Care to see inside?" 
he called out. He added that it 
would be fifty cents apiece more 
and Uncle Charlie shelled out. 

Mary hesitated at the hatch. 
Pimple face was joined by what 
appeared to be his twin and they 
Started to hand her down in. She 
drew back and I moved in fast, 
intending to do any handling myself. My reasons were 99% professional; I could feel danger all 
through the place. "It's dark," 
she quavered. 

"It's safe," the second young 
man said. "We've been taking 
sightseers through all day. I'm 
Vince McLain. Come on, lady.** 

Uncle Charlie peered down the 
hatch, like a cautious mother 
hen. "Might be snakes in there," 
he decided. "Mary, I don't think 
you had better go in." 

"Nothing to fear," the first McLain said insistently. "It's safe." 

"Keep the money, gentlemen." 
Uncle Charlie glanced at his finger watch. "We're late. Let's go, 
my dears." 

I followed them back up the 
path, my hackles up until we 
reached the car. Once we were 
rolling, the Old Man said sharply, 
"Wey,, what did you see?" 

I countered with, "Any doubt 
about that first report? The one 
that broke off?" 

"None." 

"That thing wouldn't have 
fooled an agent, even in the dark. 



This wasn't the ship he saw.** 

"Of course not. What else?" 

"How much would you say 
that fake cost? New sheet metal, 
fresh paint, and from what I saw 
through the hatch, probably a 
thousand feet of lumber to brace 
it." 

"Go on." 

"Well, the McLain place had 
'mortgage' all over it. If the boys 
were in on the gag, they didn't 
foot the bill." 

"Obviously. You, Mary?" 

"Uncle Charlie, did you notice 
how they treated me?" 

"Who?" I said sharply. 

"The state sergeant and the 
two boys. When I use the sweetljttle -bundle -of -sex routine, something should happen. Nothing 
did." 

"They were attentive," I objected. 

"You don't understand. Something was wrong with them. 
Harem guards, if you know what 
I mean." 

"Hypnosis?" asked the Old 
Man. 

"Possibly. Or drugs, perhaps." 
She frowned and looked puzzled. 

"Sammy, take the next turn to 
the left. We're investigating a 
point two miles south of here." 

"The triangulated location by 
the pic?" I asked. 

"What else?" 

But we didn't get there. First 
it was a bridge out and I didn't 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



have room enough to make the 
car hop it, aside from traffic regulations for a duo on the ground. 
We circled south and came in 
again, the only remaining route. 
We were stopped by a young 
highway cop. A brush fire, he 
told us; go any farther and we 
would probably be drafted into 
nrefighting. He didn't know but 
what he ought to send me up to 
the nrelines anyhow. 

Mary waved her lashes at him 
and he relented. She pointed out 
that neither she nor Uncle Charlie 
could drive, a double lie. 

After we pulled away, I asked 
her, "Harem guard?" 

"Oh, my, no! A most attractive 
man." 

Her answer annoyed me. 

The Old Man vetoed taking to 
the air and making a pass over 
the spot. He said it was useless. 
We headed for Des Moines. Instead of parking at the toll gates, 
we paid to take the car into the 
city and ended up at the studios 
of Des Moines stereo. Uncle 
Charlie blustered our way into 
the office of the general manager. 
He told several lies — unless 
"Charles M. Cavanaugh" was actually a big wheel with the Federal Communications Authority. 
It wouldn't surprise me. 

Once inside, he continued the 
Big Brass act. "Now, sir, what is 
this nonsense about a spaceship 
hoax? Speak plainly. Your license 



may depend on your answer." 

The manager was a little 
round-shouldered man, but he, 
did not seem cowed, merely irritated. "We've made full explanation over the channels," he said. 
"We were victimized. The man 
has been discharged." 

"Hardly adequate, sir." 

The little man — Barnes, his 
name was — shrugged. "What do 
you expect? Want us to string 
him up by his thumbs?" 

Uncle Charlie pointed his cigar 
at him. "I warn you, sir, I am 
not to be trifled with. I am not 
convinced that two farm louts 
and a junior announcer could 
have pulled off this preposterous business. There was money in 
it. Yes, sir — money! Now tell me, 
just what did you — " 

Mary had seated herself close 
by Barnes' desk. She had done 
something to her costume and 
her pose put me in mind of 
Goya's Disrobed Lady. She made 
thumbs-down to the Old Man. 

Barnes should not have caught 
it; his attention appeared to be 
turned to the Old Man. But he 
did. He turned toward Mary and 
his face went dead. He reached 
for his desk. 

"Sam! Kill him!" the Old Man 
rapped. 

I burned his legs off and his 
trunk fell to the floor. It was a 
poor shot; I had intended to get 
him neatly.

1 stepped in and kicked his gun 
away from still-groping fingers. 
I was about to give him coup de 
grace — a man burned that way 
is dead, but it takes a while to 
die — when the Old Man snapped, 
"Don't touch him! Mary, stand 
backl" 

He sidled toward the body, 
like a cat investigating the unknown- Barnes gave a long sigh 
and was quiet. The Old Man 
poked him gently with his cane. 

"Boss," I said, "time to git, 
isn't it?" 

Without looking around he answered, "We're as safe here as 
anywhere. This building may be 
swarming with them." 

"Swarming with what?" 

"How would I know? Swarming with whatever he was." He 
pointed at Barnes' body. "That's 
what I've got to find out." 

Mary gave a choked sob and 
gasped, "He's still breathing. 
Look!" 

The body lay face down; the 
back of the jacket heaved as if 
the chest were rising. The Old 
Man looked and poked at it with 
his cane. "Sam, come here." I 
came. "Strip it," he went on. 
"Wear gloves. And be careful." 

"Booby trap?" 

"Shut up. Use care." 

He must have had a hunch 
that was close to truth. I think 
the Old Man's brain . has a 
built-in integrator which arrives 




at logical necessity from minimum facts the way a museum Joe 
reconstructs an animal from a 
single bone. First pulling on 
gloves — agent's gloves; I could 
have stirred boiling acid, yet I 
could feel a coin in the dark and 
call heads or tails — I started to 
turn him over to undress him. 

The back was still heaving. I 
did not like the look of it — unnatural. I placed a palm between 
the shoulder blades. 

A man's back is bone and muscle. This was soft and undulating. 
I snatched my hand away. 

Without a word, Mary handed 
me a pair of scissors from Barnes'' 
desk. I took them and cut the 
jacket away. The body was 
dressed in a light singlet. Between 
this and the skin, from the neck 
halfway down the back, was 
something which was not flesh. A 
couple of inches thick, it gave the 
corpse an odd round -shoulderedj 
slightly humped appearance. 

It pulsed. 

AS we watched, it slid off 
the back, away from us. I 
reached out to peel up the singlet, but my hand was knocked 
away by the Old Man's cane. 

"Make up your mind," I said, 
and rubbed my knuckles. 

He did not answer, but tucked 
his cane under the shirt and worried it up the trunk. The thing 
was uncovered. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



Grayish, faintly translucent, 
and shot through with darker 
structure, shapeless — but it was 
clearly alive. As we watched, it 
flowed down into the space between Barnes" arm and chest, 
filled it and stayed there, unable 
to go farther. 

"Poor devil," the Old Man said 
softly. 

. "Huh? That?" 
"No. Barnes. Remind me to 



see that he gets the Purple Heart, 
when this is over. If it ever is 
over." The Old Man straightened up and stumped around 
the room, as if he had forgotten 
completely the thing nestling iri 
the crook of the dead man's arm. 

I drew back and continued to 
stare at it, my gun ready. It 
could not move fast; it obviously 
could not fly; but I did not know 
what it could do. Mary pressed 




tA 




 



her shoulder against mine, as if 
for human comfort. I put my 
free arm around her. 

On a side table there was a 
stack of cans, the sort used for 
stereo tapes. The Old Man took 
one, spilled out the reels and 
came back with it. "This will do, 
I think." He placed the can on 
the floor, near the thing, and began chivying it with his cane, trying to irritate it into crawling 




over the side and into the can. 

Instead it oozed back until it 
was almost entirely under the 
body. I grabbed the free arm and 
heaved Barnes away; the thing 
clung, then flopped to the floor. 
Under Uncle Charlie's direction, 
Mary and I used our guns at lowest power to force it, by burning 
the floor close to it, into the can. 
We got it in, a close fit, and I 
slapped the cover on. 

The Old Man tucked the can 
under his arm. "On our way, my 
dears." 

He paused in the door to call 
out a parting, then, after closing 
the door, stopped at the desk of 
Barnes* secretary. "I'll be seeing 
Mr. Barnes tomorrow," he told 
her. "No, no appointment. I'll 
phone." 

Out we went, slow march, the 
Old Man with the can full of 

thing under his arm and me with 
my cars cocked for alarums. 
Mary played the silly little 
moron, with a running monologue. The Old Man even paused 
in the lobby, bought a cigar, and 
inquired directions, with bumbling, self-important good nature. 

Once in the car he gave directions, then cautioned me against 
driving fast. The directions led 
us into a garage. The Old Man 
sent for the manager and said*, 
"Mr. Malone wants this car immediately." It was a signal I had 
had occasion to use myself; the

duo would cease to exist in about 
twenty minutes, save as anonymous spare parts in the service 
bins. 

The manager looked us over, 
then answered quietly, "Through 
that door over there." He sent 
the two mechanics out of the 
room and we ducked through the 
door. 

WE ended up in the apartment 
of an elderly couple. There 
the Old Man got his bald head 
back, I acquired a mustache, and 
Mary looked as well dark as she 
had as a redhead. The "Cavanaugh" combination was dropped: Mary got a nurse's costume 
and I was togged out as a chauffeiir while the Old Man became 
our elderly, invalid employer, 
complete with lap robe and tantrums. 

A car was waiting for us. The 
trip back was no trouble ; we 
could have remained the carrottopped Cavanaughs. I kept the 
screen tuned to Des Moines, but, 
if the cops had turned up the 
late Mr. Barnes, the newsboys 
hadn't heard about it. 

We went straight to the Old 
Man's office and there we opened 
the can. The Old Man sent for 
Dr. Graves, head of the Section's 
bio lab, and the job was done 
with handling equipment. 

What we needed were gas 
masks, though. A stink of decay


ing organic matter filled the room 
and forced us to slap the cover 
on and speed up the blowers. 

Graves wrinkled his nose. 
•'What in the world was that?" 
he demanded. 

The Old Man was swearing 
softly. "Find out," he said. "Work 
it in suits, in a germ-free compartment, and don't assume that 
it is dead." 

"If tli at is alive, I'm Queen 
Anne." 

"Maybe. Just don't take 
chances. It's a parasite, capable 
of attaching itself to a host, such 
as a man. and controlling the host. 
It is almost certainly extraterrestrial in origin and metabolism." 

The lab boss sniffed. "Extraterrestrial parasite on a terrestrial 
host? Ridiculous! The body 
chemistries would be incompatible." 

"When we captured it, it was 
living on a man. If that means 
it has to be a terrestrial organism, 
show me where it fits into terrestrial life-forms and where to 
look for its mates. And quit jumping to conclusions; I want facts." 

The biologist stiffened. "You'll 
get them!" 

"Get going. And don't keep assuming that the thing is dead; 
The perfume may be a protective 
device. That thing, if alive, is fantastically dangerous. If it gets on 
one of your laboratory men, I'll 
almost certainly have to kilt him."

The lab director left minus 
some of his cockiness. 

The Old Man settled back in 
his chair, sighed, and closed his 
eyes. '"How many mustard plasters the size of that thing can arrive in a spaceship as big as that 
fraud we looked at?" 

"Was there a spaceship?" I 
asked. "The evidence seems slim." 

"There was a ship. There still 
is.** 

"We should have examined the 
site." 

"That site would have been our 
last sight. The other six boys 
weren't fools. Answer my question.'* 

"How big the ship was doesn't 
tell me anything about its payload, when I don't know its propulsion method, the jump it 
made, or what the passengers require. How long is a piece of 
rope? If you want a guess, I'd say 
maybe several thousand." 

"So there may be several thousand zombies in Iowa tonight. Or 
harem guards, as Mary puts it." 
He thought for a moment. "But 
how am I to get past them to the 
harem? We can't go shooting 
every round-shouldered man in 
Iowa; it would cause talk." He 
smiled feebly. 

"I'll put you another question," 
I said. "If one spaceship lands in 
Iowa yesterday, how many will 
land in North Dakota tomorrow? 
Or Brazil?" 



"Yes." He looked still more 
troubled. "You kids go enjoy 
yourselves ; you may not have 
another chance. Don't leave the 
offices." 

¥ WENT to Cosmetics, got my 
skin color back and resumed 
my normal appearance, had a 
soak and a massage, and then 
went to the staff lounge in 
search of a drink and company. 
I looked around, not knowing 
whether I was looking for a 
blonde, brunette, or redhead, but 
fairly sure that I could spot the 
chassis. 

It was a redhead. Mary was in 
a booth, sipping a drink and looking much as she had looked at 
first. 

"Hi, Sis," I said, sliding in beside her. 

She smiled and answered, 
"Hello, Bud, drag up a rock," 
while moving to -make room for 
me. 

I dialed for bourbon and water 
and then said, "Is this your real 
appearance?"' 

She shook her head. "Not at 
all. Zebra stripes and two heads. 
What's yours?" 

"My mother smothered me 
with a pillow, so I never got a 
chance to find out." 

She looked at me as if I were 
a side of beef. "I can understand 
why, but I am more hardened 
than she was. You'll do, Bud." 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



"Thanks. Let's drop this 'Budand-Sis' act. It gives me inhibitions," 

"I think you need every one 
you can develop." 

"Mc? Never any violence with 
me; I'm the 'Barkis -is- willing" 
type." I might have added that, 
if I laid a hand on her and she 
happened not to like it, I'd bet 
that I would draw back a bloody 
stump. The Old Man's girls arc 
never sissies. 

She smiled. "Well, Miss Barkis 
is not willing." 

Whi le we sa t t he re , I got to 
thinking how well she would look 
on the other side of a fireplace. 
My job being what it was, I had 
never thought seriously about 
getting married — after all, a babe 
is just a babe : why get excited? 
But Mary was an agent herself. 
Talking to her would not be like 
shouting off Echo Mountain. 1 
realized that I had been lonely 
for one hell of a long time. 
"Mary — " 
"Yes?" 

"Are you married?" 

"No. But what business — I 
mean, why does it matter?" 

"Look me over. I've got both 
hands and feet, I'm fairly young, 
and I don't track mud in the 
house. You could do worse." 

"Listen, wolf, your technique 
is down. Just because a woman 
turns you down is no reason to 
lose your head and offer her a 



contract. Some women would be 
mean enough to hold you to it." 

"I meant it," I said peevishly. 

"What salary do you offer?" 

"Damn you! If you want that 
type of contract, I '11 go along. 
You can keep your pay and I'll 
give half of mine to you — unless 
you want to retire." 

She shook her head. "I'd never 
insist on a settlement contract, 
not with a man I was willing to 
marry in the first place — " 

"I didn't think you would." 

"Agents should not marry," she 
said flatly. 

"Agents shouldn't marry anyone but agents." 

She started to answer, but 
stopped suddenly. My phone was 
talking in my ear, the Old Man's 
voice, and I knew she was hearing him with hers. "Come into 
my office," he said. 

We both got up without saying anything. Mary stopped me 
at the door and looked up into 
my eyes. "That is why it is silly 
to talk about marriage. All the 
time we've been talking, you've 
been thinking about the job and 
so have I." 
"I have not." 

"Sam, suppose you were married and you woke up to find one 
of those things on your wife's 
shoulders, possessing her." There 
was horror in her eyes. "Suppose 
I found one of them on your 
shoulders." 




 



"I'll chance it. And I won't let 
one get to you." 

She touched my cheek. "I don't 
believe you would." 

We went on into the Old Man's 
office. 

He looked up to say, "Come 
along. We're leaving." 

"Where?" I answered. "Or 
shouldn't I ask?" 

"White House. See the President. Shut up." 

I did. 

A T the White House, the 
Secret Service guards gave us 
the works. An X-ray went beep 
and 1 surrendered' my heater. 
Mary turned out to be a walking 
arsenal; the machine gave four 
beeps and hiccough, although you 
would have sworn she couldn't 
hide a tax receipt. The Old Man 
surrendered his cane without 
waiting to be asked. 

Our audio capsules showed up 
both by X-ray and by metal detector, but the head guard ruled 
that anything embedded in flesh 
need not be classed as a weapon. 
They printed us, photographed 
our retinas, and ushered us into a 
waiting room while the Old Man 
was allowed to see the President 
alone. 

After quite a while we were 
ushered in. The Old Man introduced us. I stammered. Mary 
just bowed. The President said 
he was glad to see us and'turned 



on that smile, the way you see it 
in the stereo casts, and he made 
us feel that he was glad to see us. 
I felt warm inside and no longer 
embarrassed. 

The Old Man directed me to 
report all that I had done and 
seen and heard on this assignment. I tried to catch his eye 
when it came to the part about 
killing Barnes, but he wasn't having any, so I left out the Old 
Man's order to shoot and made it 
clear that I had shot to protect 
another agent — Mary — when I 
saw Barnes reach for his gun. The 
Old Man interrupted me. "Make 
your report complete." 

So I filled in the Old Man's 
order to shoot. The President 
threw the Old Man a glance, the 
only expression he showed. I went 
on about the parasite thing and 
then up to that present moment. 

It was Mary's turn. She fumbled trying to explain to the President why she expected to get a 
response out of normal men — and 
had not gotten it out of the McLain boys, the state sergeant, and 
Barnes. The President helped her 
by smiling warmly and saying, 
"My dear young lady, I quite 
believe it." 

Mary blushed. The President 
listened gravely while she finished, then sat still for several 
minutes. Presently he said to the 
Old Man. "Andrew, your section 
has been invaluable. Your reports 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



have sometimes tipped the balance in crucial occasions in history." 

The Old Man snorted. "So it's 
no, is it?" 

"1 did not say so." 

"You were about to." 

The President shrugged. "Andrew, I can't start what amounts 
to war on a woman's intuition." 

Mary took a step forward. 
"Mr. President," she said very 
earnestly, "I do know. Those were 
not nor mai male men." 

He answered, "You have not 
considered an obvious explanation — that they actually were, ah, 
'harem guards.' There are always 
such unfortunates. You merely 
happened to run across four in 
one day." 

Mary shut up. The Old Man 
"did not. "God damn it, Tom — " 
I shuddered; you don't talk .to 
the President that way — "I knew 
you when you were an investigating Senator and I was a key 
man in your investigations. You 
know I wouldn't bring you this 
fairy tale if there were any reasonable way to explain it. How 
about that spaceship? What was 
in it? Why couldn't I even reach 
the spot where it landed?" He 
hauled out the photograph taken 
by Space Station Beta and 
shoved it under the President's 
nose. 

The President seemed Unperturbed. "Ah, yes, you and I have 



a passion for facts. But I have 
sources of information other than 
your section. Take this photo — 
you made a point of it when you 
phoned. The metes and bounds of 
the McLairi farm as recorded in 
the local county courthouse check 
with the triangulated latitude and 
longitude of this object on this, 
photograph." The President looked up. "Once I got lost right ire 
my own neighborhood. You 
weren't even in your own neighborhood, Andrew." 

"Did you trot out to Des 
Moines and check those courthouse maps yourself, Tom?" 
"Of course not." 
"Thank God, or you would be 
carrying three pounds of pulsing 
tapioca between your shoulders 
and God save the United States! 
Be sure of this — the courthouse 
clerk and whatever agent was 
sent both are hag-ridden this very 
moment. Yes, and the Des 
Moines chief of police, ed itors 
around there, despatchers, cops; 
all sorts of key people. Tom, I 
don't know what we are up 
against, but they know what we 
are, and they are pinching off the 
nerve cells of our social organism 
before true messages can get back 
-^or they cover up true reports 
with false ones, just as they did 
with Barnes. Mr. President, you 
rnust order an immediate, drastic 
quarantine of the area!" 

" 'Barnes'," the President re



 



peated softly. "Andrew, I had 
hoped to spare you this, but — " 
He flipped a key at his desk. "Get 
me stereo station WDES, Des 
Moines, the manager's office." 

A screen lighted on his desk; 
he touched another switch and a 
solid display in the wall lighted 
up. We were looking into the 
room we had been in a few hours 
before. 

Looking into it past a man who 
filled most of the screen — Barnes. 

Or his twin. When I kill a man, 
I expect him to stay dead. I was 
shaken, but I still believed in 
myself and my heater. 

The man said, "You asked for 
me, Mr. President?" He sounded 
as if he were dazzled. 

"Yes, Mr. Barnes. Do you recognize these people?" 

He looked surprised. "I'm 
afraid not. Should I?" 

"Tell him to call in his office 
force," the Old Man said. 

The President did so. They 
trooped in, girls mostly, and I 
recognized the secretary who sat 
.outside the door. One of them 
squealed, "Ooh, it's the President." 

None of them identified us, 
which wasn't surprising with the 
Old Man and me, but Mary's appearance was just as it had been, 
and I will bet that her looks 
would be burned into the mind of 
any woman who had ever seen 
her. . 



But I noticed one thing about 
them — every one of them was 
round-shouldered. 

ri"*EN minutes later we were 
standing in the wind on the 
Rock Creek platform. 

The Old Man seemed shrunken 
and old. 

"What now. Boss?" I asked. 

"Eh? For you two, nothing. 
You are both on leave until recalled." 

"I'd like to take another look / 
at Barnes* office." 

"Stay out of Iowa. That's an 
order. " 

"What are you going to do, if 
I may ask?" 

"I am going down to Florida 
and lie in the sun and wait for 
the world to go to hell. If you 
have any sense, you'll do the 
same. There's damned little 
time." 

He squared his shoulders and 
stumped away. I turned to speak 
to Mary, but she was gone. I 
trotted off and overtook the Old 
Man. "Excuse me, Boss. Where 
did Mary go?" 

"On leave, no doubt. Don't 
bother me." 

I considered trying to relay to 
her through the section circuit, 
only I remembered that I did not 
know her right name, nor her 
code, nor her I. D. number. I 
thought of trying to bull it 
through by describing her, but 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



that was foolishness. Only Cosmetics Records knows the original 
appearance of an agent and they 
won't talk. 

All I knew was that she had 
twice appeared as a redhead and 
that, for my taste, she was "why 
men fight." Try punching that 
into a phone! 

Instead, I found a room for the 
night. 

T WOKE up at dusk and looked 
out as the Capital came to life 
for the night. The river swept 
away in a wide band past the 
Memorial ; they were adding 
fluorescine to the water above the 
District, so the river stood out 
in curving sweeps of glowing rose 
and amber and emerald and shining fire. Pleasure boats cut 
through the colors, each filled, I 
had no doubt, with couples up to 
no good and enjoying it. 

On the land, here and there 
among older buildings, bubble 
domes were lighting up, giving 
the city a glowing fairyland look. 
To the east, where the Bomb had 
landed, there were no old buildings at all and the area was an 
Easter basket of color — giant 
eggs, lighted from within. 

I've seen the Capital at night 
oftener than most and had never 
thought much about it, but tonight I had that "Last Ride Together" feeling. It was not its 
beauty that choked me up; it was 



knowing that down under those 
warm lights were people, alive 
and individual, making love or 
having spats, doing business or 
giving the business, whatever they' 
damn well pleased, each under 
his own vine and fig tree with 
nobody to make him afraid, as 
it says. 

I thought about all those people — each with a gray slug clinging to his back, twitching his legs 
and arms, making his voice say 
what the slug wished, going where 
the slug wanted to go. 

I made myself a solemn promise; if the parasites won, I'd be 
dead before I would let one of 
those things ride me. For an agent 
it would be simple; just bite my 
nails — or, if your hands happen 
to be off there are other ways. 
The Old Man planned for all 
professional necessities. 

Except that it was his business 
and mine to keep those people 
down there safe, not to run out 
when the going got tough. 

I turned away. There was not 
a confounded thing I could do 
about it now; I decided that what 
I needed was company. The room 
contained the usual Catalog of 
"escort bureaus" and "model 
agencies" that you'll find in almost any big hotel. I thumbed 
through it, then slammed it shut. 
I didn't want just any girl: I 
wanted one particular girl, who 
would as soon shoot as shake 




 



hands. And I did not know where 
she had gone. 

I always carry a tube of "ternpus fugit" pills,, figuring you never 
know when giving your reflexes 
a jolt will get you through a tight 
spot. Despite the scare propaganda, tempus pills are not habitforming, the way hashish is. 

Nevertheless, a purist would 
say I was addicted, for I took 
them occasionally to make a 
twenty-four hour leave seem like 
a week, I enjoyed the mild euphoria the pills induced. Primarily, though, they just stretch 
your subjective time by a factor 
of ten or more — chop time into 
finer bits so that you live longer 
for the same amount of clockand-calendar. Sure, I know the 
horrible example of the young 
man who died of old age in a 
month through taking the pills 
steadily, but I took them only 
once in a while. 

Maybe he had the right idea. 
He lived a long and happy life — 
you can be sure it seemed to him 
both long and happy — -and died 
happy at the end. What matter 
that the sun rose only thirty 
times? Who is keeping score and 
what are the rules? 

I sat there, staring at my tube 
of pills and thinking that I had 
enough to keep me hopped up for 
what would be, to me, at least 
two "years." I could crawl m my 
hole and pull it in after me. 



I took out two pills and got a 
glass of water. Then I put the 
pills back in the tube, donned my 
gun, left the hotel and headed for 
the Library of Congress. 

On the way I stopped in a bar 
and looked at a newscast. There 
was no news from Iowa, but when, 
is there ever any? 

At the Library I went to the 
catalog, put on blinkers and 
started scanning for references. 
"Flying Saucers" led to "Flying 
Discs," then to "Project Saucer,'* 
then "Lights in the Sky," "Fire"balls," "Cosmic Diffusion Theory 
©f Life Origins," and two dozen 
blind alleys and screwball branches of literature. I needed a Geiger 
counter to tell me what was pay 
dirt, especially because what I 
wanted was sure to carry a semantic-content key classing it between Aesop's fables and the Lost 
Continent myths. 

In an hour, though, I had a 
Biandful of selector cards. I 
handed them to the vestal virgin 
at the desk and waited while she 
fed them into the hopper. Presently she said, "Most of the films 
you want are in use. The rest will 
fee delivered to Study Room 9-A, 
Take the escalator, puhlease." 

Room 9-A had one occupant, 
who looked up and said, "Well, 
the wolf in person! How did you 
pick me up? I could swear I shook 
you." 

I said, "Hello, Mary." 



THE PUPPET MASTERS

"Hello," she answered, "and 
now good-bye. Miss Barkis still 
ain't willin' and she has work to 
do." 

I got annoyed. "Listen, you 
conceited twerp, odd as it may 
seem, I did not come here looking 
for your no-doubt beautiful body, 
I occasionally do some work myself. When my spools arrive, I'll 
get the hell out and find another 
study room — a stag one!" 

Instead of flaring back, she immediately softened. "I'm sorry, 
Sam. Really. A woman hears the 
same thing so many thousand 
times — Sit down." 

"Thanks, but I'll leave. I'm 
here to work." 

"Stay," she insisted. "Read that 
notice. If you remove spools from 
the room to which they are delivered, you will not only cause 
the sorter to blow a dozen tubes, 
but you'll give the chief reference librarian a nervous breakdown." 

"I'll bring them back when I'm 
through." 

She took my arm and warm 
tingles went up it. "Please, Sam. 
T said I'm sorry." 

I sat down and grinned. "Nothing could persuade me to leave. 
I don't intend to let you out of 
sight until I know your phone 
code, your home address, and the 
true color of your hair," 

"Wolf," she replied softly. 
"You'll never know any of them.** 



She made a great business of fitting her head back into her study 
machine while ignoring me, 

The delivery tube went thunk 
and my spools spilled into the 
basket. I stacked them on the 
table by the other machine. One 
rolled over against the spools 
Mary had stacked up and knocked them down. I picked up what

"But It is. It's the one I want 
next." 

Sooner or later, I can see the 
obvious. Mary wouldn't be there 
to study the history of footgear. 
I picked up others of hers and 
read the labels. "So that's why 
nothing I wanted was in," I said. 
"But you didn't do a thorough 
job." I handed her my selection. 

Mary looked them ever, then 
pushed them all into a single pile. 
"Shall we split them, or both of 
us see them all?" 

"Fifty-fifty to weed out the 
junk, then we'll both go over the 
remainder," I decided. "Let's get 
Tbusy." 

Even after having seen the 
parasite on poor Barnes' back, 
even after being assured by the 
Old Man that a "Flying Saucer" 
had in fact landed, I was not prepared for the pile of evidence to 
be found buried in a public library. A pest on Digby and his 
evaluating formula! The evidence 
was unmistakable; earth had been 
visited by ships from outer space 
not once but many times. 

The reports long antedated our 
own achievement of space travel; 
some ran back into the Seventeenth Century, or even earlier 
than that, but it was impossible 
to judge reports dating back to 
the time when "science" meant an 
appeal to Aristotle. The first systematic data came from the 
1940s and 50s; the next flurry was 



in the 13?!©s. T noticed something 
and started taking down dates. 
Strange objects in the sky appeared to hit a cycle at thirtyyear intervals, about. A statistical 
analyst might make something of 
it 

"Flying Saucers" were tied in 
with "mysterious disappearances" 
not only through being in the 
same category as sea serpents, 
bloody rain, and such like wild 
data, but also because in welldocumented instances, pilots had 
chased "Saucers" and never come 
back, or down, anywhere, i.e., officially classed as crashed in wild 
country and not recovered — an 
easy-out explanation. 

I got another wild hunch and 
tried to see whether or not there 
was a thirty-year cycle in mysterious disappearances and, if so, 
did it match the objects- in -thesky cycle? I could not be surethere are too many people disappearing every year for all kinds 
of reasons. But vital records 
have been kept for a long time 
and not all were lost in the bombings. I noted it down to farm out 
for professional analysis. 

Mary and I did not exchange 
three words all night. Eventually 
we got up and stretched. Then I 
lent Mary change to pay the machine for the spools of notes she 
had taken (why don't women 
carry change?) and got my wires 
out of hock, too.

"Well, what's the verdict?" I 
asked. 

"I feel like a sparrow who has 
built a nice nest in a rain spout." 

I recited the old jingle. "And 
we'll do the same — refuse to learn 
and build again in the spout." 

"Oh, no! Sam, we've got to do 
something! It makes a full pattern; this time they are moving 
in to stay." 

"Could be. I think they are." 

"Well, what do we do?" 

"Honey, you are about to learn 
that in the Country of the Blind, 
the one-eyed man is in for a hell 
of a rough ride." 

"Don't be cynical. There isn't 
time." 

"No, there isn't. Let's, get out 
of here." 

Dawn was on us and the library 
was almost deserted. I said, "Tell 
you what. Let's find a barrel of 
beer, take it to my hotel room, 
bust in the head, and talk this 
over." 

She shook her head. "Not to 
your room." 

"Damn it, this is business." 

"Let's go to my apartment. It's 
only a couple of hundred miles 
away; I'll fix breakfast there." 

I recalled my purpose in life 
just in time to leer. "That's the 
best offer I've had all night. 
Seriously, why not the hotel? 
We'd save a half hour's travel," 

"You don't want to come to 
rny apartment? I won't bite you." 



"I was hoping you would. No, 
I was wondering why the sudden 
switch." 

"Well, perhaps I wanted to 
show you the bear traps around 
my bed. Or perhaps I wanted to 
prove to you I could cook." 

I flagged a 'copter taxi and we 
went to her apartment. 

When we got inside she made 
a careful search of the place, then 
came back and said, "Turn, 
around. I want to feel your back." 

"Why—" 

"Turn around!" I shut up. She 
gave it a good knuckling, then 
said, "Now you feel mine." 

"With pleasure!" Nevertheless 
I did a proper job, for I saw what 
she was driving at. There was 
nothing under her clothes but girl 
and assorted items of lethal hardware. 

She turned around and gave a 
sigh. "That's why I didn't want 
to go to your hotel. Now I know 
we are safe for the first time since 
I saw that thing on the station 
manager's back. This apartment 
is tight; I turn off the air and 
leave it sealed like a vault every 
time I leave it." 

"Say, how about the air conditioning ducts?" 

"I didn't turn on the conditioner system ; I cracked one of 
the air raid reserve bottles instead. Never mind; what would 
you like to eat?" 

"Any chance of a steak with

just the chill taken off it?" 

There was. While we chomped, 
we watched the newscast. Still no 
news from Iowa. 

1DID not get to see the bear 
traps; she locked her bedroom 
door. Three hours later she woke 
me and we had a second breakfast. Presently we struck cigarettes and I switched off the newscast It was principally a display 
of the entries for "Miss America." 
Ordinarily I would have watched 
with interest, but none of the 
babes was round-shouldered. 
I said, "Well?" 

"We've got to arrange the facts 
and rub the President's nose in 
them.'* 

"How?" 

"We've got to see him again." 

I repeated, "How?" 

She had no answer. 

I said, "We've got only one 
route — through the Old Man." 

I put in the call, using both 
our codes so that Mary could 
hear. Presently I heard, "Chief 
Deputy Oldfield, for the Old 
Man. Shoot." 

"It's got to be the Old Man." 

There was a pause. "Is this official or unofficial?" 

"Uh, I guess you'd call it unofficial," 

"Well, I won't put you through 
for anything unofficial. And anything official I am handling." 

I switched off before I used any 



bad language. Then I coded 
again. The Old Man has a special code which is guaranteed to 
raise him up out of his coffin, 
but God help the agent who uses 
it unnecessarily. 

He answered with profanity. 

"Boss," I said, "on the Iowa 
matter — " 

He broke off short. 

"Yes?" 

"Mary and I spent all night 
digging data out of the files. We 
want to talk it over." 

The profanity resumed. Presently he told me to turn it in for 
analysis and added that he intended to have my ears fried for 
a sandwich. 

"If you can run out, so can wc," 
I said sharply. "Mary and I are 
resigning right now. That's official!" 

Mary's eyebrows went up, but 
she said nothing. There was a 
long silence, then he* said, in a 
tired voice, "Palmglade Hotel, 
North Miami Beach." 

"Right away." I sent for a taxi 
and we went up on the roof. I had 
the hackie swing out over the 
ocean to avoid the Carolina speed 
traps, so we made good time. 

THE Old Man lay there, looking sullen and letting sand 
dribble through his fingers, while 
we reported. I had brought along 
a buzz box so that he could get it 
directly off the wire.

He glanced up when we came 
to the point about thirty-year 
cycles, but he let it ride until my 
later query about possible similar 
cycles in disappearances, whereupon he called the Section. "Get 
me Analysis. Hello, Peter? This 
is the boss. I want a curve on unexplained disappearances, starting with 1800. Huh? Smooth out 
known factors and discount 
steady load— what I want is 
humps and valleys. When? Two 
hours ago; what are you waiting 
for?" 

He struggled to his feet, let me 
hand him his cane and said, 
"Well, back to the jute mill." 

"To the White House?" Mary 
asked eagerly. 

"Eh? Be your age. You two 
have picked up nothing that 
would change the President's 
mind. 1 ' 

"Oh. Then what?" 

"I don't know. Keep quiet, unless you have a bright idea." 

The Old Man had a car and I 
drove us back. After I turned it 
over to block control, I said, 
"Boss, I've got something that 
might convince the President." 
He grunted. "Like this," I went 
on. "Send two agents in, me and 
one other. The other agent carries a portable scanning rig and 
keeps it trained on me. You get 
the President to watch." 

"Suppose nothing happens." 

"I'll make it happen. I am go


ing where the spaceship landed 
and bull my way through. We'll 
get closeuppix of the real ship, 
piped into the White House. Then 
I'll go to Barnes' office and investigate those round' shoulders. 
I'll tear shirts off right in front 
of the camera. There won't be any 
finesse: I'll just bust things wide 
open." 

"You realize you have the same 
chance as a mouse at a cat convention?" 

"I'm not so sure. As I see it, 
these things haven't superhuman 
powers. I'll bet they are limited 
to whatever the human being 
they are riding can do. I don't 
plan on being a martyr. In any 
case I'll get pix." 

"It might work," Mary put in. 
"I'll be the other agent. T can — " 

The Old Man and I said "No" 
together — and then I flushed; it 
Was not my prerogative. 

Mary went on, "I was going to 
say that I am the logical one because of the, uh, talent I have 
for spotting a man with a parasite." 

"No," the Old Man repeated. 
"Where he's going, they'll all 
have riders — assumed so until 
proved otherwise. Besides, I am 
saving you for something." 

"For what? This is important.'* 
The Old Man said quietly, "So 
is the other job. I'm planning to 
make you a Presidential bodyguard." 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



"Oh." She thought and answered, "I'm riot certain I could 
spot a woman who was possessed. 
I'm not. uh, equipped for it." 

"So we take his women secretaries away from him. And you'll 
be watching him, too, Mary." 

"And what if I find that one 
has gotten to him, in spite of 
ell our careful precautions?" 

"You take necessary action, the 
Vice President succeeds to the 
chair, and you get shot for 
treason. Now about this mission. 
We'll send Jarvis with the scanner and include Davidson as 
hatchet man. While Jarvis keeps 
the pickup on you, Sam. Davidson can keep his eyes on Jarvis — 
and you can try to keep one eye 
on him." 

"You think it will work, then?" 

"No, but any plan is better 
than no plan. Maybe it will stir 
up something." 

WHILE we headed for Iowa — 
Jarvis, Davidson and I — • 
the Old Man went to Washington. Mary cornered me as we 
were about to leave, grabbed me 
by the ears, kissed me firmly and 
said. "Sam, come back." 

I got all tingly and felt like a 
fifteen-year-old. 

Davidson roaded the car beyond the place where I had found 
a bridge out. I was navigating, 
using a map on ^vhich had been 
pinpointed the landing site of the 



real spaceship. The bridge gave 

a precise reference point. We 
turned off the road two-tenths of 
a mile due east of the site and 
jeeped through the scrub to the 
spot. 

Almost to the spot, I should 
say. We ran into burned-over 
ground and decided to walk. The 
site shown by the Space Station 
photograph was in the brush fire 
area — and there was no 'Flying 
Saucer." It would have taken a 
better detective than I to show 
that one had ever landed. The 
fire had destroyed all traces. 

Jarvis scanned everything, anyhow, but I knew that the slugs 
had won another round. As we 
came out, we ran into an elderly 
fanner. 

"Quite a fire," I remarked, 
keeping a wary distance. 

"Sure was," he said dolefully. 
"Killed two of my best milch 
cows, the poor dumb brutes. You 
fellows reporters?" 

"Yes. but we've been sent on a 
wild goose chase." I wished Mary 
were along. Maybe this character 
was naturally round-shouldered, 
but assuming that the Old Man 
was right about the spaceship — and he had to be right — then this 
too-innocent bumpkin- must know 
about it and was covering up. 
Ergo, he had to be hag-ridden. 

I threw a glance at my teammates. They were alert and Jarvis 
Was scanning.

As the farmer turned, I tripped 
him. He went down with me on 
his back, clawing at his shirt. 
Jarvis moved in and got a closeup. I had his back bare before 
he got his wind. 

And it was bare — no parasite, 
no sign of one, nor any place on 
his body, which 1 made sure of. 

I helped him up and brushed 
him off; his clothes were filthy 
with ashes. "I'm sorry," I said. 

"You young — " He couldn't 
find a word bad enough for me. 
He looked at us and trembled 
with anger. "I'll have the law on 
you. If I were twenty years 
younger, I'd lick all three of you." 

"Believe me, old-timer, it was 
a mistake. 1 " 

"Mistake !" I thought he was 
going to cry. "I come back from 
Omaha and find my place burned, 
half my stock gone, my son-inlaw no place around, strangers 
snooping around my land, and I 
like to get torn to pieces. Mistake! What's the world coming 
to?" 

I thought I could answer that 
last one, but there was no point. 
I tried to pay him for the indignity, but he slapped my money 
to the ground. We tucked in our 
tails and got out. 

When we were rolling again, 
Davidson said, "Are you sure you 
know what you are up to?" 

"I can make a mistake," I said 
savagely, "but have you ever 



known the Old Man to?" 

"Mmm . . . no. Where next?" 

"wues, stereo station. This one 
one won't be a mistake.** 

AT the toll gates into Des 
Moines, the gatekeeper hesitated. He glanced at » notebook 
and then at our plates. "Sheriff 
has a call out for this car," he 
said. "Pull over to the right." 

"Right it is," I agreed, backed 
up thirty feet and gunned her. 
The Section's cars are beefed up 
and hopped up — a good thing, for 
the gate was stout. I did not. slow 
down on the far side. 

"This," said Davidson, "is intt-i esting. Do you still know what 
you are doing?" 

"Cut the chatter," I snapped. 
"Get this, both of you: we aren't 
likely to get out. But we are going to get those pix." 

Ahead of any pursuit, I slammed to a stop in front of the station and we poured out. None of 
"Uncle Charlie's" indirect methods — we swarmed into the first 
elevator and punched for Barnes* 
floor. When we got there I left 
the door of the car open. 

The receptionist tried to stop 
us, but we pushed by. The girls 
looked up, startled. I went 
straight to Barnes' inner door and 
tried it; it was locked. 

I turned to his secretary. 
"Where's Barnes?" 

"Who is calling, please?" she 



THE PUPPET MASTEtS 



said, about as polite as a fish. 

I looked down at her shoulders. Humped. By God, I said to 
myself, this one has to be. She 
Was here when I killed Barnes. 

I bent over and pulled up her 
sweater. 

I was right. I had to be right. 
For the second time I stared at 
one of the parasites. 

She struggled and clawed and 



tried to bite. I judo-cut her neck, 
almost getting my ha,nd in the 
mess, and she went limp. I swung 
her around. 

"Jarvis," I yelled, "get a closeup." 

The idiot was riddling with his 
gear, his big hind end between me 
and the pickup. He straightened. 
"School's out," he said. "Blew a 
tube." 





 



"Replace it. Hurry!" 

A stenographer stood up on the 
other side of the room and fired 
at the scanner. Hit it, too, before 
Davidson burned her down. As 
if it had been a signal, about six 
of them jumped Davidson. They 
did not seem to have guns; they 
just swarmed over him. 

I hung onto the secretary and 
shot from where I was. 1 caught 



a movement out of the corner of 
my eye and turned to find Barnes 
—"Barnes" number two — standing in his doorway. I shot him 
through the chest to get the slug 
I knew was on his back, then returned to the slaughter. 

Davidson was up again. A girl 
crawled toward him; she seemed 
wounded. He shot her in the face 
and she stopped. His next bolt

was just barely past my ear. 

I said, "Thanks! Let's get out 
of here." 

The elevator was open ; we 
rushed in, me still burdened with 
Barnes' secretary. I slammed the 
door and started it. Davidson was 
trembling and Jarvis was white. 

"Buck up," I said. "You 
weren't shooting people, but 
things. Like this." I held the girl 
up and looked down at her back. 

Then I almost collapsed. My 
specimen, the one I had grabbed 
to take back alive, was gone. 
Sliped to the floor, probably, and 
oozed away during the ruckus. 

"Jarvis." I said, "did you get 
anything?" 

He shook his head. 

The girl's back was covered 
with a rash like a million pinpricks, where the thing had ridden 
her. I settled her on the floor 
against the wall of the car. She 
was still unconscious, so we left 
her. There was no interference as 
we went through the lobby to 
the street. 

A policeman had bis foot on 
our car while making out a ticket. 
He handed it to me and said, 
"You can't park in this area, 
Mac.'* 

I said, "Sorry," and signed his 
copy. Then I gunned the car 
away, got as clear as I could of 
traffic — and blasted into the air 
right from a city street. I wondered whether he added that to 



the ticket. When I had her at altitude, I switched license plates 
and identification code. The Old 
Man thinks of everything. 

Only he did not think much of 
me. I tried to report on the way 
in, but he cut me short and ordered us into the Section offices. 
Mary was there with him. 

"How much did you see?" I 
asked when I had finished reporting. 

"Transmission cut off when you 
hit the toll barrier," he informed 
me. "The President was not impressed by what he saw." 

"I suppose not." 

"He told me to fire you." 

I stiffened. "I am perfectly 

will—" 

"Pipe down !" the Old Man 
snapped. "I told him that he 
could fire me, but not my subordinates. You are a thumb-fingered dolt," he went on quietly, 
"but you can't be spared now." 

"Thanks." 

Mary had been wandering 
around the room. She stopped 
back of Jarvis's chair — and gave 
the Old Man the sign she had 
given for Barnes. 

I hit Jarvis in the head with 
my heater and he sagged out of 
his chair. 

"Stand back, Davidson!" the 
Old Man rapped. His gun was out 
and pointed at Davidson's chest. 
"Mary, how about him?" 

"He's all right." 



3' 4 




 



"And him?" 
"Sam's clean." 

The Old Man's eyes moved 
over us and I have never felt 
closer to death. "Peel off your 
shirts," he said sourly. We did. 
Mary was right. I had begun to 
wonder whether I would know it 
if I did have a parasite on me. 
"Now him," the Old Man ordered. "Gloves." 

We stretched Jarvis out and 
carefully cut his clothing away. 
We had our live specimen. 

1" FELT myself ready to retch. 

The thought of that thing 
right behind me all the way from 
Iowa was more than even my unsqueamish stomach could stand. 

I swallowed and said, "Let's 
work it off. Maybe we can still 
save Jarvis.' I did not really think 
so; I had a deep-down hunch 
that anyone who had been ridden 
by one of those things was 
spoiled, permanently. 

The Old Man waved us back. 
"Forget Jarvis." 

"But—" 

"Stow it! If he can be saved, a 
bit longer won't matter. In any 
case — -" He shut up and so did I. 
I knew what he meant. We were 
expendable; the people of the 
United States were not. 

The Old Man. gun drawn and 
wary, continued to watch the 
thing on Jarvis's back. He said 
to Mary, "'Get the President. Spe


cial code zero zero zero seven.** 

Mary went to his desk. I heard 
her talking into the muffler, but 
my own attention was on the 
parasite. It made no move to 
leave Jarvis. 

Presently Mary reported, "I 
can't get him, sir. One of his assistants is on the screen. Mr. McDonough." 

The Old Man winced. McDonough was an intelligent, likable 
man who hadn't changed his 
mind on anything since he was 
housebroken. The President used 
him as a buffer. 

No, the President was not available. No, he could not be reached 
with a message. No, Mr. McDonough was not exceeding his 
authority; the Old Man was not 
on the list of exceptions — if there 
was such a list. Yes, Mr. McDonough would be happy to 
make an appointment; that was 
a promise. Today? Out of the 
question. Tomorrow? Impossible. 
How would next Friday do? 

The Old Man switched off and 
seemed about to have a stroke. 
Then he took two deep breaths, 
his features relaxed, and he said, 
"Dave, ask Doc Graves to step 
in. The rest of you keep your 
distance." 

The head of the biological lab 
came in shortly. "Doc," said the 
Old Man, "there is one that isn't 
dead." 

Graves looked closely at Jar


THE PUPPET MASTERS

vis's back, "Interesting," he said. 
He dropped to one knee. 
"Stand back!" 

Graves looked up. "But I must 
have an opportunity — " 

"I want you to study it, yes, 
but, first, you've got to keep it 
alive. Second, you've got to keep 
it from escaping. Third, you've 
got to protect yourself." 

Graves smiled. "I'm not afraid 
ef it." 

"Be afraid of it ! That's an 
order." 

"I must rig up an incubator to 
care for it after we remove it. 
These things obviously need oxygen — not free oxygen, but oxygen 
from its host. Perhaps a large 
dog would suffice." 

"No," snapped the Old Man. 
"Leave it where it is." 

"What? Is this man a volunteer?" The Old Man did not 
answer. Graves pointed out, "Human laboratory subjects must be 
volunteers. Professional ethics, 
you know." 

"Doctor Graves, every single 
agent in this Section is a volunteer for whatever I find necessary. 
Please carry out my orders." 

After they had carted Jarvis 
away, Davidson and Mary and I 
went to the lounge for a drink or 
four. We needed them. Davidson 
had the shakes. When the first 
drink failed to fix him, I said, 
"Look, Dave, I feel as bad about 
those girls as you do, but it could 



not be helped. Get that through 
your head." 

"How bad was it?" asked Mary. 

"Pretty bad. I don't know how 
many we killed." I turned to 
Davidson. "We weren't shooting 
peoplej we were shooting parasites. Don't you see that?"'' 

"That's just it. They weren't 
human. You shoot and they keep 
coming toward you." 

After a bit, he left. Mary and 
I talked a while, trying for answers and getting nowhere. Then 
she announced that she was 
sleepy and headed for the women's dormitory. The Old Man had 
ordered all hands to sleep in that 
night, so I went to the boys' wing 
and crawled in a sack. 

THE air raid alarm woke me. I 
stumbled into clothes as blowers sighed off; then the intercom 
bawled in the Old Man's voice, 
"Anti-gas and a nti -radiation procedures! Seal everything! All 
hands gather in the conference 
hall. Move.'" 

Being a field agent, I had no 
local duties. I shuffled down the 
tunnel to the offices. The Old 
Man was in the big hall, looking 
grim. I wanted to ask what was 
up, but there were a dozen clerks, 
agents, stenos and such there before me. 

The Old Man sent me out to 
get the door tally from the guard 
on watch. He called the roll and 



36 




 



presently it was clear that every 
person listed on the door tally 
was now inside the hall, from old 
Miss Haines, the Old Man's secretary, down to the steward of the 
lounge — except the door guard 
and Jarvis. The tally had to be 
right; we keep track of who goes 
in and out a bit more carefully 
than a bank keeps track of 
money. 

I was sent out again for the 
door guard. It took a call back 
to the Old Man before he would 
leave his post; he then threw the 
bolt switch and followed me. 
When we got back, Jarvis was 
there, attended by Graves and a 
lab man. He was wrapped in a 
hospital robe, conscious, apparently, but dopy. 

I began to have some notion 
of what it was all about. The Old 
Man was facing the assembled 
staff and keeping his distance; he 
had his gun out. "One of the invading parasites is loose among 
us," he said. "To some of you, 
that means too much. To the rest 
of you, I will have to explain, as 
the safety of all of us — of our 
whole race — depends on complete 
cooperation and utter obedience." 
He went on to explain briefly but 
with ugly exactness what a parasite was, what the situation was. 
"In short," he concluded, "the 
parasite is almost certainly in this 
room. One of us looks human but 
is an automaton, moving at the 



will of our deadliest enemy.** 

People stole glances at each 
other. Some tried to draw away. 
A moment before we had been a 
team; now we were a mob, each 
suspicious of the other. I found 
myself edging away from the man 
closest to me — Ronald, the lounge 
steward, whom I had known for 
years. 

Graves cleared his throat. 
"Chief," he started in, "I took 
every reasonable—" 

"Stow it. Bring Jarvis out in 
front. Take his robe off." 

Graves shut up and he and his 
assistant complied. Jarvis seemed 
only partly aware of his surroundings. Graves must have 
drugged him. 

"Turn him around," the Old 
Man ordered. 

Jarvis let himself be turned ; 
there was the mark of the slug, a 
red rash on shoulders and neck. 
There had been whispers and embarrassed giggles when Jarvis had 
been stripped; now there was a 
dead hush. 

"We are going to get that slug!'* 
said the Old Man. "Furthermore, 
we are going to capture it alive. 
You have all seen where a parasite rides a man. I'm warning 
you; if the parasite gets burned, 
I'll burn the man who did it. If 
you have to shoot to catch it, 
shoot low. Come here!" He 
pointed his gun at me, halted me 
halfway between the crowd and 



THE PUPPET MASTERS

himself. "Graves, sit Jarvis down 
behind me. No, leave his robe 
off." The Old Man turned back 
to me. "Drop your gun on the 
floor." 

The Old Man's gun was 
pointed at my belly; I was very 
careful how I drew mine. I slid 
it six feet away from me. "Take 
off all your clothes," he said. 

The Old Man's gun overcame 
my inhibitions, though it did not 
help to have one of the girls 
whisper, "Not bad!" and another 
reply, "Knobby, I'd say." I 
blushed. 

After he looked me over, the 
Old Man told me to pick up my 
gun. "Back me up," he ordered, 
"and keep an eye on the door. 
You, Dotty Something -or -other 
—you're next." 

Dotty was a girl from the clerical pool. She had no gun, of 
course, and she was dressed in a 
floor -length negligee. She stepped 
forward, stopped. 

"You really mean it?" she said 
incredulously. 

"Move!" 

She almost jumped. "Well! No 
need to take a person's head off." 
She bit her lip as she unfastened 
the clasp at her waist. "I ought 
to get a bonus for this," she said 
defiantly, then threw the robe 
from her. 

"Over against the wall," the 
Old Man said savagely. "Now the 
rest of you.*' 



In twenty minutes there were 
more square yards of gooseflesh 
exposed than I had ever seen before, and the pile of guns looked 
like a small-arms arsenal. 

When Mary's turn came, she 
took her clothes off quickly and 
without a fuss. She made nothing of it, wearing her skin with 
quiet dignity. She added considerably to the pile of hardware. 
I decided she just plain liked 
guns. 

WE were all evidently free of 
parasites, except the Old 
Man and his old-maid secretary. 
I think he was a bit in awe of 
Miss Haines. He looked distressed 
and poked about in the pile of 
clothing with his cane. Finally he 
looked up at her. "Miss Haines — 
if you please." 

I thought to myself, brother, 
this time you are going to have 
to use force. 

She stood there, facing him 
down, a statue of offended modesty. I moved closer and said, 
out of the corner of my mouth, 
"Boss, how about yourself? Suppose you take 'em off." He looked 
startled. "I mean it," I said. "It's 
you or she. Might be either. Out 
of those duds." 

The Old Man can recognize the 
inevitable. He said, "Have her 
stripped." He began fumbling at 
his zippers, looking grim. I told 
Mary to take a couple of women 



36 




 



and peel Miss Haines. When I 
turned back, the Old Man had his 
trousers at half mast — and then 
Miss Haines made a break for it. 

The Old Man was between us 
and I couldn't get in a clean 
shot and every other agent in the 
place was disarmed! I don't think 
it was accident; the Old Man did 
not trust them not to shoot. He 
wanted that slug alive. 

She was out the door and runn ing down the passage by the 
time I got organized. I could 
have winged her in the passageway, but I was inhibited — first, 
I could not shift gears emotionally that fast. I mean to say she 
was still Old Lady Haines, secretary to the boss, the one who 
bawled me out for poor grammar 
in my reports. In the second place, 
if she was carrying a parasite, I 
did not want to risk burning it. 

She ducked into a room. Again 
I hesitated — sheer habit; it was 
the ladies' room. 

But only a moment. I slammed 
the door open and looked around, 
gun ready. 

Something hit me back of my 
right ear. 

T CAN give no clear account of 
the next few moments. I was 
out cold, for a time at least. I remember a struggle and some 
shouts: "Look 'out?" "Damn her, 
she's bitten me!" "Watch your 
hands!" Then somebody quietly, 



"By her hands and feet — careful.** 
Somebody said, "How about 
him?" and someone answered, 
"Later. He's not hurt." 

I was still practically out as 
they left, but I began to feel a 
flood of life stirring back into me. 
I sat up, feeling extreme urgency 
about something. I got to my feet, 
staggering, and went to the door. 
I looked out cautiously; nobody 
was in sight. I trotted down the 
corridor, away from the conference hall. 

At the outer door, I realized 
that I was naked and tore on 
down the hallway to the men's 
wing. There I grabbed the first 
clothes I could find and pulled 
them on. The shoes were much 
too small for me; it did not seem 
to matter. 

I ran back to the exit, found 
the switch. The door opened. 

I thought I had made a clean 
escape, but somebody shouted, 
"Sam!" just as I was making 
my choice of six doors and then 
I plunged on out. At once I had 
three more beyond the one I 
picked. The warren we called the 
"offices" was served by a spaghettilike mess of tunnels. I came 
up finally inside a subway fruitand-bookstall, nodded to the 
proprietor, swung the counter 
gate and mingled with the crowd. 

I caught the up-river jet express and got off at the first station. I crossed over to the down

river, waited around the change 
Window Until a man. came up who 
displayed quite a btt of money 
as he bought his counter. I got 
on the same train and got off 
when he did. At the first dark 
spot I rabbit -punched him. Now 
I had money and was ready to 
operate. I did not know why I 
had to have money, but I knew 
that I needed it for what I was 
about to do. 

T SAW things around me with 
a curious double vision, as if I 
stared through rippling wateryet I felt no surprise and no curiosity. I moved like a sleepwalker, 
unaware of what I was going to 
do, and still I was wide awake, 
aware of who I was, where I was, 
what my job at the Section had 
been. And, although I did not 
know my objective. I was always 
conscious of what I was doing 
and sure that each act was the 
necessary act at that moment. 

I felt no emotion most of the 
time, except the contentment that 
comes from work which needs to 
be done. That was on the conscious level. Someplace, more 
levels down than I understand 
about, I was excruciatingly unhappy, terrified, and filled with 
guilt, but that was down, way 
down, locked, suppressed, I was 
hardly aware x>S it and not affected by it. 

I knew that I had been seen to 



leave. That shout of "Sam!" was 
for me; only two persons knew me 
by that name and the Old Man 
would have used my right name. 
So Mary had seen me leave. \t 
was a good thing, I thought, that 
she had let me find out where 
her apartment was. It would be 
necessary to booby trap it against, 
her using it. In the meantime I 
must get on with work and keep 
from being picked up. 

I was moving through a warehouse district, all my training at 
work to avoid being noticed. 
Shortly I found a satisfactory 
building; there was a sign: loft 

FOR LEASE — SEE RENTAL AGENT ON 

ground floor. I scouted it, noted 
the address, then doubled back 
to a Western Union booth. There 
I took a vacant machine and sent 
this message: expedite two cases 

TINV TOTS TALK TALES SAME DISCOUNT CONSIGNED JOEL FREEMAN 

and added the address of the loft. 
I sent it to Roscoe & Dillard, 
Jobbers and Manufacturers 
Agents, Des Moines, Iowa. 

As I left the booth, the sight of 
one of the Kwikf ede restaurants 
reminded me that I was hungry, 
but the reflex abruptly cut off 
and I thought no more about it. 
I returned to the warehouse, 
found a dark corner in the rear, 
and settled back to wait for dawn 
and business hours. 

I have a dim recollection of 
claustrophobic nightmares.

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



At nine o'clock I met the rental 
agent as he unlocked his office, 
and leased the loft, paying him a 
fat squeeze for immediate possession. I went up to the lpft, unlocked it, and waited. 

About ten-thirty my crates 
were delivered. After the expressmen were gone, I opened a crate, 
took out one cell, warmed it, and 
got it ready. Then I found the 
rental agent again and said, "Mr. 
Greenberg, could you come up 
for a moment? I want to see 
about making some changes in 
the lighting." 

TTE fussed, but did so. When we 
entered the loft -I closed the 
door and led him to the crate. 
"Here," I said, "if you will lean 
over, you will see just what I 
mean." 

I got him with a grip that cut 
off his wind, ripped his jacket 
and shirt up, and, with my free 
hand, transferred a master from 
the cell to his bare back, then 
held him tight until he relaxed. 
I let him up, tucked his shirt in 
and dusted him off. When he 
caught his breath, 1 said, "What 
news from Des Moines?" 

"What do you want to know?" 
he asked. "How long have you 
been out?" 

I started to explain, but he interrupted with, "Let's, have direct 
conference and not -waste time." 
I skinned up my shirt, he did the 



same, and we sat down on the 
unopened crate, back to back, 
so that our masters could be in 
contact. My own mind was blank; 
I have no idea how long it went 
on. I watched a fly droning 
around a dusty cobweb. 

HpHE building superintendent 
was our next recruit. He was 
a large Swede and it took both 
of us. After that Mr. Greenberg 
called up the owner and insisted 
that he had to come down and 
see some damage that had occurred to the structure — - just 
what, 1 don't know; I was busy 
working with the super, opening 
and warming more cells. 

The owner of the building was 
a prize and we all felt pleased, 
including, of course, the man himself. He belonged to the Constitution Club, the membership of 
which read like Who's TVho in 
Finance, Government and Industry. 

It was pushing noon; we had 
no time to lose. The super went 
out to buy clothes and a satchel 
for me, and he sent the owner's 
chauffeur up to be recruited as 
he did so. At twelve-thirty we 
left, the owner and I, in his town 
car; the satchel contained twelve 
masters, in their cells but ready. 

The owner signed /. Hardwick 
Potter 8s Guest A flunky tried 
to take my bag, but I insisted 
that I needed it to change my; 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



shirt before lunch. We stalled 
around in the washroom until we 
had it to ourselves, except for 
the attendant — whereupon we recruited him and sent him with a 
message to the manager that a 
guest was ill in the washroom. 

After we took care of the manager, he obtained a white coat 
and I became another washroom 
attendant. I had only ten masters 
left, but the cases would be picked 
up from the toft and delivered to 
the club shortly. The regular attendant and I used up the rest of 
those I had before the lunch hour 
rush was over. One guest walked 
in on us while we were busy and 
I had to kill him. We stuffed him 
i«to the mop closet,. 

There was a lull after that, as 
the cases had not yet arrived. 
Hunger reflex nearly doubled me 
over ; then it dropped off, but 
persisted. I told the manager, who 
had me served lunch in his office. 
The cases arrived as I was finishing. 

During the drowsy period in 
the mid -afternoon, we secured the 
place. By four o'clock everyone 
i« the building — members, staff, 
a*»d guests — were with us. From 
then on, we processed them in the 
lobby as the doorman passed 
them in. Later in the day the 
manager phoned Des Moines for 
more cases. Our big prize came 
that evening — the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. We saw a 



real victory; the Treasury Department is charged with the 
safety of the President. 

CJOME- days after I was re*^ cruited, I gave the club manager instructions about shipments 
of masters' carrying cells. I was 
fleetingly aware, as I did so, that 
three more ships had landed, but 
my overt knowledge was limited 
to an address in New Orleans. 

I thought nothing about it; I 
went on with my work. I was a 
new "special assistant to Mr. 
Potter" and spent the days in his 
office — and the nights, too. Actually, the relationship may have 
reversed; I frequently gave oral 
instructions to Potter. Or perhaps I understand the social organization of the parasites as little now as I did then. 

Through me. my master knew 
as much as I did. It knew that 
I was one human known to the 
Old Man to have been recruited 
— and knew, I am sure, that the 
Old Man would not cease to 
search for me, to recapture me or 
kill me. 

It seems odd that it did not 
change bodies and kill mine; wc 
had vastly more recruits available 
than we had masters. It could not 
have felt anything parallel to 
human squeamishness, for masters newly delivered from their 
transit cells frequently damaged 
their hosts. We always destroyed 



•2 




 



the host and found a new one. 
On the other hand, would a 
skilled cowhand destroy a welltrained horse in favor of an untried, strange mount? That may 
have been why I was kept hidden 
and used. 

After a time the city was "secured" and my master started 
taking me out on the streets. I 
do not mean that every inhabitant wore a hump — the humans 
were very numerous and the mas


ters still very few — but the key 

positions in the city were held by 
our own recruits, from the cop on 
the corner to the mayor and the 
chief of police, not forgetting 
ward bosses, ministers, board 
members, and any and all in public communication and news. The 
majority continued their usual 
affairs, not only undisturbed by 
the masquerade but unaware ©f 
it. 

Unless, of course, one vt them

happened to be in the way of 
some purpose' of a master, in 
which case he Was disposed of. 

That was when I was allowed 
outside, walked to the uptown 
launching platform and made to 
order a cab. One was lifted to the 
loading ramp and I started to get 
in. But an old gentleman bustled 
up and climbed into it ahead of 
me, 1 ' 

I received an order to dispose 
of him. It was immediately 
countermanded by another telling 
me to go slow and be careful. I 
said. ^'Excuse me, sir, but this 
cab is taken." 

"Quite," the elderly man replied. "I've taken it." 

"You will have to find another." I said reasonably. "May I 
sec your ticket?" 

I had him; the cab carried the 
launching number shown by my 
ticket, but he did not stir. "Where 
are you going?" he demanded. 

"New Orleans," I answered, 
and learned for the first time my 
destination. 

"Then you can drop me off in 
Memphis." 

J shook my head. "It's out of 
my way." 

. "All of fifteen minutes!" He 
seemed to have difficulty controlling his temper. "Driver, explain to this person the public 
conveyance rules." 

The driver stopped picking his 
teeth. "It's nothing to me. 1 pick 



'em up, I take 'em, I drop 'em. 
Settle it yourselves or I'll ask the 
despatcher for another fare." 

I hesitated, not yet having been 
instructed. Then I found myself 
climbing inside. "New Orleans." 
I said, "with a stop at Memphis." 

The driver shrugged and signaled the control tower. The 
other passenger snorted and got 
in after me. 

In the air, he opened his briefcase and spread papers across 
his knees. Watching him with 
disinterest, I found myself shifting position to let me get at my 
gun easily. The man shot out a 
hand, grabbed my wrist. "Not so 
fast, son," he said, and his features broke into the Satanic grin 
of the Old Man himself. 

My reflexes are fast, but I was 
at the disadvantage of having 
everything routed from me to my 
master, passed on by it, and action routed back to me; How 
much delay is that? I don't know. 
As I was drawing. I felt a gun 
against my ribs. "Take it easy." 

With his other hand, he thrust 
something against my side. I felt 
a prick, and then through me 
spread the warm tingle of a jolt 
of "Morpheus" taking hold. I 
made one more attempt to pull 
my gun free and sank forward. 

¥ WAS vaguely aware of voices. 
* Someone was handling me 
roughly and someone else was

saying, "Watch out for that ape!" 
Another voice replied, "It's all 
right; his tendons are cut," to 
which the first retorted, "He's still 
got teeth, hasn't he?" 

Ves, I thought fretfully, and 1/ 
you get close, I'll bite you with 
them. The remark about cut tendons seemed to be true; none of 
my limbs would move, but that 
did not worry me as much as being called an ape. It was a shame 
to call a man names when he 
couldn't protect himself. 

I wept a little and then fell 
into a stupor, until I heard, "Feeling better, son?" 

The Old Man was leaning over 
the end of my bed, staring 
thoughtfully. His chest was bare 
and grizzled. 

"Unh," I said, "pretty good. I 
guess." I started to sit up and 
found I could not. 

The Old Man came around to 
the side. "We can, take those restraints off," he said, fiddling with 
clasps. "Didn't want you hurting 
yourself. There!" 

I sat up, rubbing myself. 

"Now," said the Old Man, 
''how much .do you remember?" 

"Remember?" 

"They caught you. Do you remember anything after the parasite got to you?" 

I felt a sudden wild fear and 
clutched at the bed. "Boss! They 
know where this place is! / told 
them." 



w No, they don't,** he answered 
quietly, "because these aren't the 
offices you remember. I had the 
old ones evacuated. They don't 
know about this hangout — I 
think. So you remember?" 

"Of course I remember. I got 
out of here — I mean out of the 
old offices and went up — " My 
thoughts raced ahead; I had a 
sudden image of holding a live 
master in my bare hand, ready 
to place it on the rental agent. 

I threw up. 

The Old Man said gently, "Go 
ahead." 

"Boss, they're all around. 
They've got the city." 

"I know. Same as Des Moines. 
And Minneapolis, St. Paul, New 
Orleans, and Kansas City. Maybe 
more. I don't know — I can't be 
everywhere." He scowled and 
added, "It's like fighting with 
your feet in a sack. We're losing 
fast. We can't even clamp down 
on the cities we know about." 

"Good God!, Why not?" 

"You should know. Because 
'older and wiser heads' are still 
unconvinced. Because when the 
parasites take over a city, everything goes on as before." 

I stared.,. 

"Never mind," he said gently. 
"You are the first break we've 
had, the first victim to be recaptured alive — and now we find 
you remember what happened. 
That's important. And your para


T H E PUPPET MASTERS 



45 



site is the first one we've managed to capture and keep alive. 
We'll have a chance to—" 

My face must have been a 
mask of terror. The notion that 
my master was still alive and 
might get to me again was more 
than I could stand. 

The Old Man shook me. "Take 
it easy. You are still pretty weak." 

"Where is it?" 

"Eh? The parasite? Don't 
worry about it. It's living off your 
opposite number, a red orangutan, name of Napoleon. It's 
safe." 

"Kill it!" 

"Hardly. We need it alive for 
study." 

I must have gone to pieces, for 
he slapped me. "Take a brace," 
he said. "I hate to bother you 
when you are sick, but I've got 
to. We have to get down on wire 
everything you remember." 

I pulled myself together and 
started making a careful report 
of alt that I could remember. I 
described renting the loft and recruiting my first victim, then how 
we moved on to the Constitution 
Club. The Old Man nodded. 
"Logical. You were a good agent, 
even for them." 

"You don't understand," I objected. "/ didn't do any thinking. 
I knew what was going on, but 
that was all. It was as if — " I 
paused, stuck for words. 

"Never mind. Get on." 



"After we recruited the club 
manager, the rest was easy. We 
took them as they came in and — " 

"Names?" 

"M. C. Greenberg. Thor Hansen, J. Hardwick Potter, his 
chauffeur Jim Wakeley, a little 
guy called 'Jake' who was washroom attendant, but he had to 
be disposed of later — his master 
would not let him take time out 
for necessities. Then there was 
the manager; 1 never did get his 
name." I paused, letting my mind 
run back, trying to make sure 
of each recruit. "Oh, my God!" 

"What is it?* 

"The Assistant Secretary of the 
Treasury!"' 

"You got him?" 

"Yes. The first day. How long 
ago was that? Chief, the Treasury 
Department protects the President!" 

But there was just a hole in 
the air where the Old Man had 
been. 

T WOKE up with my mouth 
* foul, head buzzing, and a sense 
of impending disaster. Nevertheless I felt fine, by comparison. A 
cheerful voice said, "Feeling better?" 

A small brunette creature was 
bending over me. She was a cute 
little bug and I was well enough 
to appreciate the fact, though 
faintly. She was dressed in an 
odd costume, white shorts, a wisp 




 



of stuff that covered her breasts, 
and a sort of metal carapace 
that covered the neck, shoulders 
and spine. 

"Some," I admitted. 

"Mouth taste unpleasant?" 

"Like a mailman's sox." 

She gave me some stuff in a 
glass; it burned a little and 
washed away the bad taste. 

"No," she said, "don*t swallow 
it. 'Pit it out and I'll get you 
water." I obeyed. "I'm Doris 
Marsden," she went on, "your 
dny nurse." 

"Glad to know you, Doris," I 
answered and stared at her. "Say, 
why the burlesque getup? Not 
tijat I don't like it, but you look 
like a refugee from a comic book." 

She giggled. "You'll get used 
to it. I did." 

"I like it. But why?" 

"Old Man's orders." Then I 
knew why, and I started to feel 
worse again. Doris said, "Now 
for supper." She got a tray. 

"I don't want anything to eat.'* 

"Open up," she said firmly, "or 
you'll get it through a tube." 

Between gulps, taken in selfdefense, I managed to choke out, 
"I feel pretty good. One jolt of 
'gyro* and I'll be on my feet." 

"No stimulants," she said flatly, 
still shoveling it in. "Special diet 
and lots of rest, with a sleepy pill 
later." 

"What's wrong with me?" 
"Exhaustion, starvation, and

incipient scurvy. You also had 
scabies and lice, but we got those 
whipped. Now you know — and if 
you tell the doctor, I'll call you 
a liar to your face. Turn over." 

I did so and she started changing dressings. I appeared to be 
spotted with sores. I thought 
about what she had told me and 
tried to remember how I had 
lived under my master. 

"Stop trembling," she said. 
"Having a bad one?" 

"I'm all right," I told her. As 
near as I could recall, I had not 
eaten oftener than every second 
or third day. Bathing? Let me 
see — I hadn't bathed at all! I had 
shaved every day and put on a 
clean shirt, but only because that 
was necessary to the masquerade 
and the master knew it. 

On the other hand, I had never 
taken off my shoes from the time 
I had stolen them until the Old 
Man had recaptured me, and they 
had been too tight to start with. 
1 couldn't even feel my feet. 

1L1KE nurses; they are calm 
and earthy and tolerant. Miss 
Briggs, my night nurse, was not 
the cute job that Doris was; she 
had a face like a horse. She wore 
the same musical comedy rig that 
Doris sported, but she wore it 
with a no-nonsense air and strode 
like a grenadier. Doris, bless her 
heart, jiggled pleasantly when 
she walked. 

47 



Miss Briggs refused me a second sleeping pill when I woke up 
in the night and had the horrors, 
but she did play poker with me 
and skinned me out of half a 
month's pay. I tried to find out 
from her about the President, but 
she wasn't talking. She would not 
admit that she knew anything 
about parasites, Flying Saucers, 
or what not — and she herself 
dressed in a costume that could 
have only one purpose! 

I asked her what the public 
news was, then. She maintained 
that she had been too busy to 
look at a- 'cast. So I asked to have 
a stereo box moved into my room. 
She said I would have to ask the 
doctor; I was on the 'quiet' list. 
I asked when I was going to see 
this so-called doctor. About then 
her call bell sounded and she 
left, 

I fixed her. While she was gone. 
I cold-decked the deal, so that 
she got a pat hand — and then I 
wouldn't bet against her. 

T GOT to sleep and was awakened by Miss Briggs slapping me in the face with a washcloth. She got me ready for breakfast. Then Doris relieved her and 
brought in the tray. While I was 
chomping I tackled her for news 
— with the same score I had made 
with Miss Briggs. Nurses run a 
hospital as" if it were a nursery 
for backward children. 



Davidson came to see me after 
breakfast . * 'He a rd you were 
here," he said. He was wearing 
shorts and nothing else, except 
that his left arm was covered by 
a dressing. 

"More than I've heard," I complained. "What happened to you?" 

"Bee stung me." 

If he didn't want to tell how 
he had gotten burned, that was 
his business. I said, "The Old 
Man was in here yesterday and 
left very suddenly. Seen him 
since?" 

"Yep." 

"Well?" 

"Have the psych boys cleared 
you for classified matters?" 

"Is there any doubt about it?" 

"You're darn tootin' there is. 
Poor old Jarvis never did pull 
out of it." 

I hadn't thought about Jarvis. 
"How is he now?" 

"He isn't. Dropped into a coma 
and died — the day after you left. 
1 mean the day after you were 
captured." Davidson looked me 
over. "You must be tough." 

I did not feel tough. Tears of 
helplessness and frustration welled up again and I blinked them 
back. Davidson pretended not to 
notice and went on, "You should 
have seen the ruckus after you 
gave us the slip. The Old Man 
took out after you, wearing nothing but a gun and a look of grim 
determination. He would have

caught you, but the police picked 
him up and we had to get him 
out of hock." 

I grinned feebly. There was 
something both gallant and silly 
about the Old Man charging out 
to save the world in his birthday 
suit. "Sorry I missed it. What 
else has happened — lately?" 

Davidson looked me over. 
"Wait a minute." He stepped out 
and was gone a short time. When 
he came back, he said, "The Old 
Man says okay. What do you 
Want to know?" 

"Everything! What happened 
yesterday?" 

"That's how I got this." He 
waved his damaged wing at me. 
"I was lucky," he added. "Three 
agents were killed. Quite a fracas." , 

"But how about the President? 
Was he — " 

Doris bustled in. "Oh, there 
you are!" she said to Davidson. 
"I told you to stay in bed. You're 
due at Mercy Hospital right now. 
The ambulance has been waiting 
ten minutes." 

He stood up, grinned, and 
pinched her with his good hand. 
"The party can't start until I get 
there." 

"Well, hurry l" 

"Corning." 

I called out, "Hey! How about 
the President?" 

Davidson looked back over his 
shoulder. "Oh, him? He's all 



right. Not a single scratch.** 
He went on. 

Doris came back a few minutes 
later, fuming. "Patients!" she 
said, like a swear word. "I should 
have had twenty minutes for his 
injection to take hold. So instead 
I had to give it to him when he 
got into the ambulance." 

"injection for what?" 

"Didn't he tell you?" 

"No." 

"Amputation and graft, lower 
left arm." 

"Oh." Well, I thought, / won't 
hear the end of the story from. 
Davidson. Grafting on a new limb 
is a shock. They keep the patient hopped up for at least ten 
days. So I tackled Doris again. 
"How about the Old Man? WaJ 
he wounded?" 

"You talk too much," she answered. "It's time for morning 
nourishment and your nap." She 
produced a glass of milky slop. 

"Speak up, wench, or I'll spill 
it on the floor." 

"The Old Man? You mean thfl 
Chief of Section?" 

"Who else?" 

"He's not on the sick list." Sh« 
crossed her fingers on both hands, 
"I wouldn't want him as a pa-« 
tient!" 

FOR two or three more days I 
was kept in bed and treated 
like a child. I did not care; it waa 
the first real rest I had had in 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



49 



years. The sores got better and 
presently I was encouraged— "required," I should say — to take 
light exercise around the room. 

The Old Man called on me. 
"Well," he said, "still malingering." 

I flushed. "Damn your black, 
chilblained heart,'* I told him. 
"Get me some pants and I'll show 
you who is malingering." 

"Slow down." He took my 
chart and looked it over. "Nurse," 
Ik said, "get this man a pair of 
shorts. I'm restoring him to 
duty." 

Doris faced up to him like a 
banty hen. "You may be the big 
boss, but you can't give orders 
here. The doctor will—" 

"Stow it." he said, "and get 

those drawersl'.' 

She went out, sputtering, and 
came buck with the doctor. The 
Old Man said mildly, "Doc, I 
sent for pants, not for you." 

The medico replied stiffly, "I'll 
thank you not to interfere with 
my patients." 

"He's not your patient. He's going back on duty." 

"If you do not like the way I 
run my department, sir, you may 
have my resignation." 

The Old Miin answered, "I beg 
your pardon. Doctor. Sometimes 
I become too preoccupied to follow correct procedure. Will you 
please do me the favor of examining this patient? If he can be 



restored to duty, it would help 
me to have his services at once." 

The doctor's jaw muscles were 
jumping, but he said, "Certainly, 
sir." He went through a show of 
studying my chart, then tested 
my reflexes. "He needs more recuperation, but you may have 
him. Nurse, fetch clothing for this 
man." 

Clothing consisted of shorts 
nnd shoes. Everybody else was 
dressed the same way, however, 
and it was comforting to see all 
those bare shoulders with no masters clinging to them. I told the 
Old Man so. 

"Best defense we've got," he 
growled, "even if it does make 
the city look like a beach. If we 
don't win this set-to before winter weather, we're licked." 

He stopped at a door with a 

Sign: BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY 

STAY OUT! 

I hung back. "Where are we 
going?" 

"To take a look at your twin, 
the ape with your parasite." 

"That's what I thought. Not for 
me!" I could feel myself tremble. 

"Now. look, son," he said patiniUy. "Get over yom panic' Hie 
b« si way is to face up to" it. I 
know it's hard. I've spent hours 
getting used to the sight." 

"You don't know — you can'r 
know!" I had the shakes so badly 
that I had to clutch the door 
frame.

"I suppose it's different," he 
said slowly, "when you've actually had it. Jarvis — " He broke 
off. 

"You're damn right it's different! You're not going to get 
me in there!" 

"No, I guess not. Well, go on 
back, son, and check in at the 
infirmary." He started into the 
laboratory. 

He had gotten three or four 
steps away before I called out, 
"Boss!" He stopped and turned, 
his face expressionless. "Wait," I 
added. "I'm coming." 

"You don't have to.** 

"I'll do it. It — it just takes a 
while — to get your nerve back." 

AST came alongside him, he 
**• grasped my arm, warmly 
and affectionately, and continued 
to hold it as we walked. We went 
through another locked door and 
into a room conditioned warm 
and moist. The ape was there, 
caged. 

His torso was supported and 
restrained by a strap-metal 
framework. His arms and legs 
hung limply, as if he had no 
control over them. He looked up 
at us with eyes malevolent and 
intelligent; then the fire died out 
and they were merely the eyes of 
a dumb brute in pain. 

"Around to the side," the Old 
Man said. 

I would have hung back, but 



he still had me by the arm. The 
ape followed us with his eyes, 
but his body was held by the 
frame. From the new position I 
could see — 

The thing that had ridden my 
back for an endless time, spoken 
with my mouth, thought with my 
brain. My master. 

"Steady," the Old Man said 
softly. 

I took a couple of deep breaths 
and managed to slow my heart 
down. I made myself stare at it. 

It is not the appearance of a 
parasite which arouses horror, 
nor is it even from knowing what 
they can do — for I felt the horror 
the first time I saw one. before 
I knew what it was. I tried to tell 
the Old Man so. 

He nodded, his eyes on the 
parasite. "It's the same with 
everybody. Unreasoning fear, like 
a bird with a snake. Probably its 
prime weapon." He looked away 
from it, as if too long a sight were 
too much for even his rawhide 
nerves. 

I stuck with him, telling myself that it couldn't harm me. I 
looked away and found the Old 
Man's eyes on me. 

"How about it?" he said. "Getting hardened?" 

"A little. All I want is to kill 
it! I could spend my life killing 
them and killing them." I began 
to shake again. 

The Old Man studied me. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS

**Here," he said, and handed me 
his gun. , 

It startled me. I was unarmed, 
having come straight from bed. 
I took it, but looked at him questloningly. 

"You want to kill it. If you 
have to, go ahead. Right now." 

"But — you told me you needed 
this one for study." 

"I do. But jf you feel that you 
need to kill it, to make you a 
whole man again, go ahead." 

"To make me a whole man 
again — " The Old Man knew 
what medicine it would take to 
cure me. I was no longer trembling; the gun was cradled in my 
hand, ready to spit and kill. 
While .this one was alive, I would 
still crouch and tremble in the 
dark. As for others — why, we 
could capture a dozen at the Constitution Club. With this one 
dead, I'd lead the raid myself. 

Breathing rapidly, I raised the 
gun. 

Then T turned and chucked it 
to the Old Man. 

"What happened?" he asked. 

"I don't know. It was enough 
to know that I could." 
■ "I figured it would be." 

I felt warm and relaxed, not 
even angry with the Old Man for 
what he had done. "I know you 
did. damn you. How does it feel 
to be a puppet master?" 

He answered soberly, "Not me. 
The most I ever do is lead a man 



on the path he wants to follow. 
There is the puppet master." 

"Yes," I agreed softly, " 'the 
puppet master.' You think you 
know what you mean, but you 
don't. I hope you never do." 

"I hope so, too," he answered. 

I could look now without trembling. Still staring at it, I said, 
"Boss, when you are through 
with it, promise me that I can 
kill it." 

"It's a promise." 

WE were interrupted by a man 
bustling in. He was dressed 
in shorts and a lab coat; it made 
him look silly. It was not Graves 
—I never saw him again. I imagine the Old Man ate him for 
lunch. 

"Why are you wearing a coat?" 
The Old Man's gun was out and 
menacing. 

The man stared at the gun as 
jf it were a bad joke. ^Why, I 
was working. There is .always a 
chance of splattering one's self. 
Sonne of our solutions are 
rather — " 

"Take it off!" 

The man took his coat off. His 
shoulders didn't have the telltale 
rash. "Take that damned coat 
and burn it," the Old Man told 
him. "Then get back to work." 

The man hurried away, his face 
red, then stopped and said, 
"Chief, are you ready for that, 
uh, procedure?" 




 



"Shortly. I'll let you know." 

He left. The Old Man wearily 
put his gun away. "Post an order," he muttered. "Read it aloud. 
Make them initial it. Tattoo it on 
their narrow little chests. And 
always some smart Aleck thinks 
it doesn't mean him. Scientists!** 

I turned back to my former 
master. It still revolted me, but 
I there was a gusty feeling of dan
ger, too, that was not totally unpteasant. "Boss," I asked, "what 
are you going to do with this 
thing?" 

"I plan to interview it." 

"To what? But how — " 

"No, the ape can't talk. We'll 
have to have a volunteer — a human volunteer." 

WHEN I began to visualize 
what he meant, the horror 
struck me again full force. "You 
can't mean that. You wouldn't 
do that to anybody." 

"It needs to be done and it will 
be done." 

"You won't get any volunteers!" 

"I've got one." 
"You have? Who?" 
"But I don't want to use the 
one I've got. I'm still looking 
for the right person." 

I was disgusted and showed it. 
"If you've got one, you won't 
find another; there can't be two 
people that crazy." 

"Possibly," he agreed. "But I 



still don't want the one I've got 
The interview is a 'must,' son; we 
are fighting with a total lack of 
military intelligence. We don't 
know our enemy, we can't negotiate with him, we don't know 
where he comes from, nor what 
makes him tick. We've got to find 
out; our existence depends on it. 
The only way to talk to these 
things is through a human. So it 
will be done. But I'm sttll looking 
for a volunteer." 

"Don't look at me!" 

"I am looking at you." 

I managed to splutter, "You'rtt 
crazy! I should have killed it 
when I had your gun — I would 
have if I had known why you 
wanted it. But as for volunteering 
to let you put that thing — Nor* 

He ploughed on as if he had 
not heard me, "It has to be a man 
who can take it. - Jarvis wasn't 
stable enough, nor tough enough. 
We know you are." 

"Me? All you know is that I 
lived through it once. I ... I 
couldn't stand it again." 

"You are proved and salted. 
With anyone else, I run more risk 
of losing an agent." 

"Since when did you worry 
about risking an agent?" I said 
bitterly. 

"Always. I am giving you on* 
more chance, son. Are you going 
to do this, knowing that it haa 
to be done and that you stand tht 
best chance of anybody — and can 



THE 'PUPPET MASTERS 



S3 



be of most use to us, because you 
did live through it — or are you 
going to let some other agent risk 
his reason and his life in your 
place?" 

I started to try to explain how 
I felt. I could not stand the 
thought of dying while possessed 
by a parasite. Even worse was 
the prospect of nor dying once 
the slug touched me. But I could 
not find words for it. 

I could feel my face set and 
twitch with tension. "There is a 
limit to what any man can go 
through. I won't do it." 

He turned to the intercom on 
the wall. "Laboratory," he called 
out. "We'll start now. Hurry up!" 

I recognized the voice of the 
man who had walked in on us. 
•"Which subject?" he asked. 

"The original volunteer." 

"The smaller rig?" the voice 
asked doubtfully. 

"Right. Get it in here." 

I started for the door. The Old 
Man snapped, "Where are you 
going?" 

"Out," I snapped back. "I want 
fto part of this." 

He grabbed me and spun me 
■round. "No, you don't. You 
know about these creatures; your 
Hdvice could help." 

"Let go of me." 

"You'll stay," he said savagely, 
•strapped down or free to move! 
I made allowances for your illBess, but I've had enough." 



I was too weary to buck him. 
"You're the boss." 

* I iHE lab people wheeled in a 
sort of chair, more like a Sing 
Sing special than anything eke. 
There were clamps for ankles and 
knees, wrists and elbows. There 
was a canvas corselet to restrain 
the waist and chest, but the back 
was cut away so that the shoulders of the victim would be free. 

They placed it beside the ape's 
cage, then removed the side of 
the cage nearest the chair. The 
ape watched with intent, aware 
eyes, but his limbs still dangled 
helplessly. Nevertheless, I became 
still more disturbed at the cage 
being opened. Only the Old Man's 
threat kept me there. The technicians stood back, apparently 
ready. The outer door opened and 
several people came in. Among 
them was Mary. 

I was caught off balance ; I had 
been wanting to see her and had 
tried several times to get word 
to her through the nurses — but 
they either could not identify her 
or had received instructions. Now 
I saw her under these circumstances. I cursed the Old Man to 
myself. It was no show to bring a 
woman to, even a woman agent. 
There ought to be decent limits 
somewhere. 

Mary looked surprised and 
nodded. I let it go at that ; it was 
no time for small talk. She was 



&4 



GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTIOM 



looking good, though very sober. 
She was dressed in the costume 
tli<- nurses had worn, but she did 
not have the ludicrous helmet 
and back plate. The others present were men, loaded with recording and stereo equipment as well 
as other apparatus. 

"Ready?" inquired the lab 
chief. 

"Get going," answered the Old 
Man. 

Mary walked straight to the 
chair and sat down. Two technicians knelt and started fastening the clamps. I watched in a 
frozen daze. Then I grabbed the 
Old Man, literally threw him 
aside, and I was by the chair, 
kicking the technicians out of the 
way. 

"Mary!" I screamed. "Get up 
from there!" 

The Old Man had his gun on 
me. "Away from her," he ordered. 
"You three— grab him and tie 
him." 

I looked at the gun, then down 
at Mary. She did not move; her 
feet were already bound. She 
simply looked at me with compassionate eyes. 

"Get up, Mary," I said dully. 
"I want to sit down." 

They removed the ch a i r a nd 
brought in a larger one. I could 
not have used hers ; both were 
tailored to size. When they, finished clamping me, I might as 
well have been cast in concrete. 



My back began to itch unbearably, although nothing, as yet, 
had touched it. 

Mary was rio longer in the 
room; I had not seen her leave 
and it did not seem to matter. 
After I had been prepared, the 
Old Man laid a hand on my arm, 
and said quietly, "Thanks, son." 
I did not answer. 

I was not interested enough to 
watch them handle the parasite 
behind my back, even if I had 
been able to turn my head, which 
I couldn't. Once the ape barked 
and screamed and someone 
shouted, "Watch it!" 

There was silence, as if everyone was holding his breath. Then 
something moist touched my neck 
and I fainted. 

WITH the same tingling energy I had experienced before, I came out of the faint, 
realizing I was in a tight spot, 
but warily determined to think 
my way out. I was not afraid; I 
was contemptuous and sure that 
I could outwit them. 

The Old Man said sharply, 
"Can you hear me?" 

I answered, "Quit shouting." 
"Do you remember what we 
are here for?" 

"You want to ask questions. 
What are you waiting for?" 
"What are you?" 
"That's a silly question. I'm 
six feet one, more muscle than 



THE PUPPET MASTERS

brain, and I weigh — " 

"'Not you. You know to whom 
] am talking — you." 

"Guessing games?'* 

The Old Man waited before 
Replying, "It's no good to pretend I don't know what you are." 
| ""Oh, go ahead and pretend.'* 

*You know that I have been 
studying you all the time you 
fcave been living on the body of 
that ape. I know things which 
give me an advantage. One — " 
the Old Man started ticking 



them off — "you can be killed. 
Two, you can be hurt. You don't 
like electric shock and you can't 
stand the heat that even a man. 
can stand. Three, you are helpless without your host. I could 
have you removed and you would 
die. Four, you have no powers 
except those you borrow from 
your host. He is helpless. Try 
your bonds. You must cooperate 
or die!" 

I had already been trying my 
bonds, finding them, as I ex



 




pectcd, impossible to escape. 
This did not worry me. I was 
oddly contented to be back with 
my master, to be free of troubles 
and tensions. My business was 
to serve; the future would take 
care of itself. One ankle strap 
seemed less tight than the other. 
Possibly I might drag my foot 
through it. I checked on the arm, 
clamps. If I relaxed completely— 
An instruction came at once 
or I made a decision; the words 
mean the same, for there was no 
conflict between my master and 



me; we were one. Instruction or 
decision, I knew it was not time 
to risk an escape. I ran my eyes 
around the room, trying to figure 
who was armed. It was my guess 
that only the Old Man was. That 
bettered the chances. 

Somewhere, deep down, was 
that ache of guilt and despair 
never experienced by any but the 
servants of the masters. I was 
much too busy, though, to be 
troubled by it. 

"Well?" the Old Man went on. 
"Do you answer questions or do 
I punish you?" 

"What questions?" I asked. 
"Up to now, you've been talking 
nonsense." 

The Old Man turned to a technician. "Give me the tickler." 

I felt no apprehension, being 
still busy checking my bonds. If 
I could tempt him into placing 
his gun within reach, assuming 
that I could get one arm free, 
then I mightHe reached past my shoulders 
with a rod. I felt a shocking pain. 
The room blacked out as if a 
switch had been thrown. I was 
split apart. For the moment, I 
was masterless. 

The pain left, leaving only 
searing memory behind. Before 
I could think coherently, the 
splitting away had ended and I 
was again safely under the control of my master. But for the 
first and only time in my service 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



to him, I was not myself free of 
worry ; echoes of his own wild 
fear and pain were passed cm to 
me. 

"Well, how did you like the 
taste?" asked the Old Man. 

The panic washed away; I was 
again filled with unworried wellbeing, however wary and watchful. My wrists and ankles, which 
had begun to pain me, stopped 
hurting. "Why did you do that?" 
I asked. "Certainly, you can hurt 
me — but why?" 1 

"Answer my questions." 

"Ask them." 

"What are you?" 

The answer did not come at 
once. As the Old Man reached for 
the rod, I heard myself hurriedly 
saying, "We are the people.** 

"What people?" 

" The only people. We have 
studied you and we know your 
Ways. We — " I stopped suddenly. 

"Keep talking," the Old Man 
said grimly, and gestured with 
the rod. 

"We come," I went on, "to 
bring you — " I wanted**to talk; 
the rod was terrifyingly close. But 
there was some difficulty with 
words. "To bring you peace,," I 
blurted out. 

The Old Man snorted. 

"Peace," I went on, "and contentment — and the joy of — of 
surrender." Surrender was not the 
right word. I struggled the way 
one struggles with a foreign 



language. *The joy," I repeated, 
"of . . . nirvana." The word fitted 
and the master was pleased. I felt 
like a dog being patted for fetching a stick. 

"Let me get this," the Old Man 
said. "You are promising the human race that if we will just sm> 
render, you will take care of us 
and make us happy. Right?''* 

"Exactly!" 

The Old Man thought about 
this while looking past my shoulders. He spat on the floor. "You 
know," he said slowly, "humanity 
has often been offered that bargain. It never worked out worth 
a damn." 

"Try it yourself," I suggested. 
rt It can be done quickly. Then 
you will know." 

He stared this time in my face. 
"Maybe I owe it to somebody to 
try it personally. Maybe I will, 
some day. But right now," he 
went on briskly, "you have questions to answer. Answer quick 
and proper and stay healthy. Be 
slow and I'll step up the current." 

I shrank back, feeling dismay 
and defeat. For a moment, thinking he was going to accept, I bad 
been planning the possibilities of 
escape. 

"Now," he went on, "where do 
you come from?" 

No answer. I felt no urge to 
answer. 

The rod came closer. "Far 
away!" I burst. out. 




 



"That's no news. Where's your 
home base, your own planet?** 
The Old Man waited, then said, 
"I'll have to touch up your memcry." I watched dully, thinking 
nothing. 

"There may be a semantic difficulty/* said an assistant. "Different astronomical concepts/' 

"Why?" asked the Old Man. 
•"That slug knows what his host 
knows; we've proved that." But 
he turned back and started a different tack. "See here, you savvy 
the Solar System. Is your planet 
Inside it or outside?" 

1 hesitated, then answered, "All 
planets are ours." 

The Old Man pulled at his lip. 
"I wonder," he mused, "what you 
mean. Never mind. You can claim 
the whole damned universe, but, 
where do your ships come from?" 

I sat silent, unable to tell him. 

Suddenly he reached behind 
me. I felt one smashing blow. 
"Talk, damn you! What planet? 
Mars? Venus? Jupiter? Saturn? 
Uranus? Neptune? Pluto?" 

As he mentioned them, I briefly 
hw them — though I have never 
been as far off Earth as the Space 
Stations. When he came to the 
fight one, I knew — and the 
thought was instantly snatched 
from me. 

I heard myself saying, "None 
•f them. Our home is much farther away." 

He looked past my shoulders 



and then into my eyes. "I thintt 
you are lying. Maybe you need 
tome juice to keep you honest." 
-No, no!" 

"No harm to try." Slowly he 
thrust the rod behind me. I knew 
the answer again and was about 
to give it, when something froze 
my throat. Then the pain started. 

I was being torn apart. I tried 
to talk, anything to stop the pain 
—but 1 wasn't allowed to. 

Through a blur of pain I saw 
the Old Man's face, shimmering 
»nd floating. "Had enough?" he 
■sked. I started to answer, and 
choked and gagged helplessly, 
dumbly. I saw him reach out 
again with the rod. 

There was, as I had told the 
Old Man, a limit to what a man 
could take, even under a master's 
control. I reached that limit and 
burst into pieces. 

rwiHEY were leaning over me* 
Someone said, "He's coming 
around." 

The Old Man's face was over 
mine. "You all right, son?" he 
asked anxiously. I turned my 
face away. 

"One side, please,** another 
Toice said. "Let me give him the 
injection." The speaker knelt by 
me and gave me a shot. He stood 
op, looked at his hands, then 
wiped them on his shorts. 

Gyro, I thought absently, ot 
something like it. Whatever it 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



was, it was pulling me back together. Shortly I sat up, unassisted. I was still in the cage room, 
directly in front of that damnable 
chair. 

I started to get to my feet. 

The Old Man gave me a hand, 
but I shook him off. 

"Sorry," he answered, then 
snapped, "Jones ! You and Ito 
get the litter. Take him to the 
infirmary. Doc, you go along." 

"Certainly." The man who had 
given me the shot started to take 
my arm. 

I drew back. "Keep your hands 
off me!" 

The doctor looked at the Old 
Man, who shrugged, then motioned them all back. Alone, I 
went through the door and past 
the outer one into the corridor. I 
paused there, looked at my wrists 
and ankles, and decided that I 
might as well go to the infirmary. 
Doris would take care of me and 
then maybe I could sleep. I felt 
as if I had gone fifteen rounds 
and lost them all. 

"Sam! Sam!" 

I knew that voice. Mary hurried up and was standing before 
me, looking at me with great 
sorrowful eyes. ''Oh, Sam! What 
have they done to you ?" Her 
voice was so choked that I could 
hardly understand her. 

"You should know," I answered and had strength enough 
left to slap her, "Bitch!" 



*]1/I~Y room was still unoccupied, 
but I did not find Doris. 1 
closed the door, then lay face 
down on the bed and tried to stop 
thinking or feeling. Presently X 
heard a gasp, and opened one 
eye. 

There was Doris. I felt her 
gentle hands on me. "Why, you 
poor, poor baby! Stay there, don't 
move now. I'll hurry right out 
and get the doctor." 

"No." 

"But you've got to have the 
doctor." 

"I won't see him. You help 
me." 

She did not answer. I heard 
her go out. She came back shortly 
— I think it was shortly — and 
started to bathe my wounds. I 
wanted to scream when she 
touched my back. But she dressed 
it quickly and said, "Over easy, 
now." 

"I'll stay face down.** 
"No. I want you to drink something. That's a good boy." 

I turned over, with her doing 
most of the work, and drank what 
she gave me. After a bit I went 
to sleep. 

I seem to remember being 
awakened, seeing the Old Man 
and cursing him. The doctor was 
there, too. Or the whole thing 
could have been a dream. 

Miss Briggs woke me and Doris 
brought me breakfast; it was as 
if I had never been off the sick 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



list. I was not in too bad shape 
though I felt as if I had gone over 
Niagara Falls in a barrel. There 
were dressings on both arms and 
both legs where 1^ had cut myself on the clamps, but no bones 
were broken. Where I was sick 
was in my soul. 

Don't misunderstand me. The 
Old Man could send me into a 
dangerous spot. That was what 
1 had signed up for. But I had 
not signed up for what he had 
done to me. He knew what made 
me tick and he had used it to 
force me into something I would 
never have done willingly. 

Jt was the Old Man that really 
hurt. Mary? There have always 
been female spies, and the young 
and pretty ones have always used 
the same tools. But she should 
not have agreed to use them 
against a fellow agent — at least, 
she should not have used them 
against me. 

Not very logical, is it? Tt was 
to me. They could go ahead with 
Operation Parasite without me. 
I owned a cabin in the Adirondacks; I had stuff there in deep 
freeze to carry me a year, maybe 
more. I had plenty of tempus 
pills; I would go up there and 
use them — and the world could 
save itself, or go to hell, without 
me. 

If anyone came within a hundred yards, he would either show 
a bare back or be burned down. 



T HAD to tell somebody about 
■* the deal I'd gotten, and only 
Doris was handy. She was indignant. Indignant? She was as sore 
as a boiled owl. Being a nurse, 
she had dressed a lot worse than 
what they had done to me. but 
this had been done by our own 
people. I blurted out how I felt 
about Mary's purt in it. 

"Do I understand that you had 
wanted to marry this girl?" 

"Correct. Stupid, ain't I?" 

"Then she knew what she could 
do to you. It wasn't fair." She 
stopped massaging me, her eyes 
snapping. "I've never met your 
redhead, but if I do, I'll scratch 
her face!" 

I smiled wanly at her. "You're 
a good kid. Doris. I believe you 
would play fair with a man." 

"Oh. I've pulled some fast ones. 
But if I did anything halfway 
like that, I'd have to break every 
mirror I own." 

Mary showed up. The first I 
knew was hearing Doris say angrily. "You can't come in." 

Mary's voice answered, "I'm 
going in." 

"Get back or I'll pull that 
hennaed hair out by the roots!" 

There were sounds of a scuffle 
and the smack of someone getting slapped. I yelled, "Hey! 
What goes on?" 

They appeared in the doorway 
'together. Doris was breathing 
hard and her hair was mussed. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



41 



Mary managed to look dignified, 
but there was a bright red patch 
on her cheek just about the size 
of Doris's hand. 

Doris caught her breath and 
said, "You get out; He doesn't 
want to see you." 

Mary said, "I'll hear that from 
him." 

I looked at them both. "Oh, 
what the hell, she's here and I've 
got some things to tell her. 
Thanks for trying, Doris." 

Doris said, "You're a fool," 
and flounced out. 

Mary came ower to the bed. 
"Sam," she said. "Sam." 

"My name isn't Sam." 

"I've never known your right 
name." 

It was no time to explain that 
my parents had burdened me 
with Elihu. I answered, 'What of 
it? Sam will do.' 

"Sam," she repeated. "Oh, Sam, 
my dear." 

"I am not your dear." 

She inclined her head. "Yes, I 
know. I don't know why. Sam, 
I came to find out why you hate 
me. Perhaps I can't change it, 
but I must know." 

I made a sound of disgust. 
"After what you did. you don't 
know why? Mary, you may be a 
cold fish, but you aren't stupid." 

She shook her head. "Just the 
reverse, Sam. I'm not cold, but 
I'm frequently stupid. Look at 
me, please — I know what they 



did to you. I know that you let 
it be done to save me from it. I 
know and I'm deeply grateful. 
But I don't know why you hate 
me. I did not ask you to do it 
and I did not want you to do it." 

I reared up on one elbow. "You 
sat down in that trick chair know- \ 
ing that I would never let you go 
through with it. You knew that, 
whether your devious female 
mind admitted it or not. The Old 
Man could not have forced me 
to with a gun, not even with 
drugs. You could. You did." 

She grew steadily paler, until 
her face was almost green against 
her hair. "Sam, that is not the 
way it was. I didn't know you 
were going to be there. I was terribly startled. But I had to go 
through with it; I had promised." 

"That covers everything. A 
schoolgirl promise." 

"No. Sam. Not a schoolgirl 
promise." 

"It doesn't matter whether you 
are telling the truth about knowing that I would be in there. The 
point is that you were there and / 
was there — and you could figure 
what would happen if you did 
what you did." 

"That's the way it looks to you 
and I can't dispute the facts." 

"Hardly." 

She stood very still for a long 
time. I let her. Finally she said, 
"Sam, once you said something 
alK>ut wanting to marry me.** 




 



"That was another day.*' 
**I didn't expect you to repeat 
the offer. But there was a sort 
of corollary. No matter what you 
think of me, I want to tell you 
that I am deeply grateful for 
what you did for me. Miss Barkis 
is willing, Sam. You understand 
me?" 

I grinned at her. "So help me, 
the workings of the female mind 
delight and astound me. You always think you can cancel anything at all with that one trump 
play." I continued to grin while 
she turned red. "I won't inconvenience you by taking up your 
generous offer." 

She came back at me in a 
steady voice. "I let myself in for 
that. Nevertheless, I meant it. 
That or anything else I can ever 
do for you." 

I sank back and lay down. 
"Sure, you can do something for 
me." 

Her face lit up. "What?" 
"Quit bothering me. Go away. 
I'm tired." 

npHE Old Man put his head in 
late that afternoon. "[ want 
to lalk to you," he started in. 

"/ don't want to talk to you. 
Get out." 

" r ignored it and came in. 
"Mind if I sit?" 

"You seem to be doing so." 

He ignored that, too. "You 
know, son, you are one of my best 



boys, but sometimes you are 
hasty." 

"Don't let that worry you," I 
answered. "As soon as the doctor 
lets me up, I'm through." 

He was not hearing anything ■. 
that he did not choose to hear. 
"You jump to conclusions. Now 
take this girl Mary — " 

"You take her." 

"You jumped all over her without knowing the score. You've got 
her all upset. Why, you may 
have ruined a good agent for me." 

"Look, I'm weeping for both of 
you." 

"You think she let herself be 
used as bait. Well, you've got it 
slightly wrong. She was being 
used, but / was using her. I planned it that way." 

"I know you did.*' 

"Then why blame her?" 

"Because you couldn't have 
carried it out without her cooperation. It's big of you, you nogood, heartless bastard, to take 
all the blame — but you can't." 

He did not hear my profanity, 
either. '"You understand everything but the key point, which is 
that the girl didn't know." 

"Hell's bells, she was there!" 

"So she was. Son, did I ever lie 
to you?" 

"No," I admitted, "but I don't 
think you would hesitate." 

He answered, "Maybe I deserve that. You'll just have to 
test it for yourself and make up 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



6g 



your mind whether or not I'm 
lying. That girl didn't know you 
were going to be in that room. 
She didn't have the faintest suspicion that I didn't mean for her 
to go through with it, or that I 
had already decided that you 
Were the only party who would 
suit me, even if I had to have 
you tied down and forced — which 
I would have done, if I hadn't 
had a double whammy up my 
sleeve to trick you into volunteering. Hell's bells yourself, son; 
she didn't even know you were 
off the sick list." 

I wanted to believe it, so I did 
my damnedest not to. 

"Look at me!" he added. "There 
is something I want to rub into 
your scalp. First off, everybody 
—including me — appreciates what 
you did, regardless of motives. 
I'm putting in a letter and no 
doubt you'll get a medal. That 
stands whether you stay with the 
Section or not. But don't give 
yourself airs as a little tin hero — ** 

"I won't!" 

** — because that medal is going 
to the wrong person. Mary ought 
to get it. Now shut up. I'm not 
through. You had to be forced 
into it. No criticism ; you had 
been through plenty. But Mary 
was a real. Simon-pure volunteer. 
.When she sat down in that chair, 
she didn't expect any last minute 
reprieve and she had every reason to believe that, if she got up 




alive, her mind would be gone, 
which is worse. What I'm trying 
to tell you is — this one is more of 
a man than you are and you've 
done her a serious wrong.** 

I was so churned up that I 
could not judge whether he was 
telling the truth, or manipulating 
me again. I said, "Maybe I lashed 
out at the wrong person. But if 
what you say is true—* 

"It is 
**— it doesn't make what you 
did any sweeter. I£ niakes it 
worse.** 

He took it without flinching. 
"Son, I'm sorry if I've lost your 
respect. But I can't be choosy 
any more than a commander can 
in battle. Less, because I iigtu. 
with different weapons. I've always been able to shoot my own 
dog. Maybe that's bad, but that 
is what my job takes. If you are

ever in my shoes, you'll have to 

do it, too." 

"I'm not likely to be.** 

"Why don't you rest up and 

think about it?" 

"I'll take leave — terminal 

leave." 

"Very well." He started to 
leave. 

I said, "You made me one 
promise and I'm holding you to 
it. About that parasite — you said 
I could kill it, personally. Are 
you through with it?** 



"Yes, but—" 

I started to get up. "No buts. 
Give me your gun; I'll do it now." 

"You can't. It's already dead." 

"What! You promised me." 

"I know. But it died while we 
were trying to force you— force it 
— to talk." 

I started to shake with laughter 
and could not stop. 

The Old Man shook me. "Snap 
out of it! Fm sorry about what 
I did, but there's nothing to laugh 
at" 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



&5 



"Sure there is , w I answered, 
sobbing and chuckling. "It's the 
funniest thing that ever happened. 
All that for nothing. You dirtied 
yourself and you loused up me 
and Mary — and all for no use." 

"What gave you that idea?" 

"You didn't even get small 
change out of it — out of us. You 
didn't learn anything you didn't 
know before.*' 

"It was a bigger success than 
you'd ever guess, son. True, we 
didn't squeeze anything out of it 
directly, before it died, but we 
got something out of you.'* 

"Me?" 

"Last night. We put you 
through it last night. You were 
doped, psyched, brain-waved, 
analyzed, wrung out and hung 
out to dry. The parasite spilled 
things to you and they were still 
there for the hypno- analysts to 
pick up after you were free of it." 

"What, for instance?" 

"We know where they come 
from and can light back — Titan, 
sixth satellite of Saturn." 

When he said it, I felt a gagging constriction of my throat and 
I knew that he was right. 

"You certainly fought 1 - before 
we could get it," he went on reminisccntly. "We had to hold you 
down to keep you from hurting 
yourself — more." 



He threw his game leg over the 
edge of the bed and struck a 
cigarette. He seemed anxious to 
be friendly. As for me, I did not 
want to fight with him; my head 
was spinning and I had things to 
get straight. Titan, That was a 
long wa^ out in space. Mars was 
the farthest men had ever been, 
unless the Seagraves Expedition, 
the one that never came back, had 
reached the Jovian moons. 

Still, we could get all the way 
to Saturn if we wanted to. 

Finally he got up to go. He had 
limped to the door when I stopped him. "Dad — " 

I had not called him that in 
years. He turned, his expression 
surprised and defenseless. "Yes, 
son?" 

"Why did you and Mother 
name me Elihu?" 

"Eh? Why, it was your maternal grandfather's name." 

"Not enough reason, I'd say." 

"Perhaps not." He turned and 
again I stopped him. 

"Dad, what sort of a person 
was my mother?" 

"Your mother? I don't know 
exactly how to tell you. Well — 
she was pretty much like Mary. 
Yes, son, a great deal like her." 
He stumped out without giving 
me further chance to talk.

The Sense 

of Wonder 

By MILTON LESSER 

When nobody aboard ship remembers where it's 
going, how can they tell when it has arrived? 



EVERY day for a week now, 
Rikud had come to the 
viewport to watch the 
great changeless sweep ot space. 
He could not quite explain the 
feelings within him ; they were 
so alien, so unnatural. But ever 
since the engines somewhere in 
the rear of the world had changed 
their tone, from the steady whining Rikud had heard all twentyfive years of his life, to the sullen 
roar that came to his ears now, 
the feelings had grown. 

If anyone else had noticed the 

Illustrated by HMtltY ROSENBAUM 



change, he failed to mention it. 
This disturbed Rikud, although 
he could not tell why. And, because he had realized this odd 
difference in himself, he kept it 
locked up inside him. 

Today, space looked somehow 
different. The stars — it was ft 
meaningless concept to Rikud, 
but that was what everyone 
called the bright pinpoints of 
lijjJit on the black backdrop in 
the viewport — were not apparent 
in the speckled profusion Rikud 
had always known. Instead, there 



THE SENSE Of WON0EI 



was more of the blackness, and 
one very bright star set apart by 
itself in the middle of the viewport. 

If he had understood the term, 
Rikud would have told himself 
this was odd. His head ached with 
the half-born thought. It was — it 
was — what was it? 

Someone was clomping up the 
companionway behind Rikud. He 
turned and greeted gray -haired 
old Chuls. 

"In five more years/' the older 
man chided, "you'll be ready to 
sire children. And all you can do 
in the meantime is gaze out at the 
stars." 

Rikud knew he should be exercising now, or bathing in the 
rays of the health-lamps. It had 
never occucred to him that he 
didn't feel like it; he just didn't, 
without comprehending. 

Chuls* reminder fostered uneasiness. Often Rikud had dreamed*of the time he would be thirty 
and a father. Whom would the 
Calculator select as his mate? 
The first time this idea had occurred to him, Rikud ignored it. 
But it came again, and each time 
it left him with a feeling he could 
not explain. Why should he think 
thoughts that no other man had? 
Why should he think he was 
thinking such thoughts, when it 
always embroiled him in a v hopeless, infinite confusion that left 
him with a headache? 



Chuls said, "It is time for my 
bath in the health-rays. I saw 
you here and knew it was your 
time, too . . ." 

His voice trailed off. Rikud 
knew that something which he 
could not explain had entered the 
elder man's head for a moment, 
but it had departed almost before 
Chuls knew of its existence. 

"I'll go with you," Rikud told 
him. 

A HARDLY perceptible purple 
glow pervaded the air in the 
room of the health-rays. Perhaps 
two score men lay about, naked, 
under the ray tubes. Chuls stripped himself and selected the space 
under a vacant tube. Rikud, for 
his part, wanted to get back to 
the viewport and watch the one 
new bright star. He had the distinct notion it was. growing larger 
every moment. He turned to go, 
but the door clicked shut and a 
metallic voice said. "Fifteen minutes under the tubes, please." 

Rikud muttered to himself and 
undressed. The world had begun 
to annoy him. Now why shouldn't 
a man be permitted to do what 
he wanted, when he wanted to do 
it? There was a strange thought, 
and Rikud's brain whirled once 
more down the tortuous course 
of half-formed questions and unsatisfactory answers. 

He had even wondered what it 
was like to get hurt. No one ever 



THE SENSE OF WONDER 



got hurt. Once, here in this same 
ray room, he had had the impulse 
to hurl himself head-first against 
the wall, just to see what would 
happen. But something soft had 
cushioned the impact — something 
which had come into being just 
for the moment and then abruptly 
passed into non-being again, 
something which was as impalpable as air. 

Rikud had been stopped in this 
action, although there was no real 
authority to stop him. This puzzled him, because somehow he 
felt that there should have been 
authority. A long time ago the 
reading machine in the library 
had told him of the elders — a 
meaningless term — who had governed the world. They told you to 
do something and you did it, but 
that was silly, because now no one 
told you to do anything. You only 
listened to the buzzer. 

And Rikud could remember the 
rest of what the reading machine 
had said. There had been a revolt — again a term without any 
real meaning, a term that could 
have no reality outside of the 
reading machine— and the elders 
were overthrown. Here Rikud had 
been lost utterly. The people had 
decided that they did not know 
where they were going, or why, 
and that it was unfair that the 
elders alone had this authority. 
They were born and they lived 
and they died as the elders di


rected, like little cogs in a great 
machine. Much of this Rikud 
could not understand, but he 
knew enough to realize that the 
reading machine had sided with 
the people against the elders, and 
it said the people had won. 

Now in the health room, Rikud 
felt a warmth in the rays. Grudgingly, he had to admit to himself 
that it was not unpleasant. He 
could see the look of easy contentment on Chuls* face as the 
rays fanned down upon him, 
bathing his old body in a forgotten magic which, many generations before Rikud's time, had 
negated the necessity for a knowledge of medicine. But when, in 
another ten years, Chuls would 
perish of old age, the rays would 
no longer suffice. Nothing would, 
for Chuls. Rikud often thought 
of his own death, still seventyfive years in the future, not without a sense of alarm. Yet old 
Chuls seemed heedless, with oAly 
a decade to go. 

Under the tube at Rikud's left 
lay Crifer. The man was short 
and heavy through the shoulders 
and chest, and he had a lame 
foot. Every time Rikud looked at 
that foot, it was with a sense of 
satisfaction. True, this was the 
only case of its kind, the exception to the rule, but it proved the 
world was not perfect. Rikud 
was guiltily glad when he saw 
Crifer limp. 



70 




 



But, if anyone else saw it, he 
never said a word. Not even 
Crifer. 




OW Crifer said, "I've been 
reading again, Rikud.'* 



"Yes?" Almost no one read 
any more, and the library was 
heavy with the smell of dust. 
Reading represented initiative on 
the part of Crifer; it meant that, 
in the two unoccupied hours before sleep, he went to the library 
and listened to the reading machine. Everyone else simply sat 
about and talked. That was the 
custom. Everyone did it. 

But if he wasn't reading himself, Rikud usually went to sleep. 
All the people ever talked about 
was what they had done during 
the day, and it was always the 
same. 

"Yes," said Crifer. "I found a 
book about the stars. They're also 
called astronomy, I think." 

This was a new thought to 
Rikud, and he propped his head 
up on one elbow. "What did you 
find out?" 

"That's about all. They're just 
called astronomy, I think." 

"Well, where's the book?" Rikud would read it tomorrow. 

"I left it in the library. You 
can find several of them under 
'astronomy,' with a cross-reference under 'stars.' They're synonymous terms.'* 

"You know," Rikud said f sit


ting up now, "the stars in the 
viewport are changing." 

"Changing?" Crifer questioned 
the fuzzy concept as much as he 
questioned what it might mean 
in this particular case. 

"Yes, there are less of them, 
and one is bigger and brighter 
than the others." 

"Astronomy says some stars 
are variable," Crifer offered, but 
Rikud knew his lame-footed companion understood the word no 
better than he did. 

Over on Rikud's right, Chuls 
began to dress. "Variability," he 
told them, "is a contradictory 
term. Nothing is variable. It 
can't be." 

"I'm only saying what I read 
in the book," Crifer protested 
mildly. 

"Well, it's wrong. Variability 
and change are two words without meaning." 

"People grow old," Rikud suggested. 

A buzzer signified that his fifteen minutes under the rays were 
up, and Chuls said, "It's almost 
time for me to eat." 

Rikud frowned. Chuls hadn't 
even seen the connection between 
the two concepts, yet it was so 
clear. Or was it? He had had it a 
moment ago, but now it faded, 
and change and old were just 
two words. 

His own buzzer sounded a moment later, and it was with a 



THE SENSE OF WONDER 



strange feeling of elation that he 
dressed and made his way back to 
the viewport. Whence passed the 
door which led to the women's 
half of the world, however, he 
paused. He wanted to open that 
door and see a woman. He had 
been told about thenvand he had 
seen pictures, and he dimly remembered his childhood among 
women. But his feelings had 
changed; this was different. 
Again there were inexplicable 
feelings — strange channclings of 
Rikud's energy in new and confusing directions. 

He shrugged and reserved the 
thought for later. He wanted to 
see the stars again. 

rw^HE view had changed, and 
the strangeness of it made 
Rikud's pulses leap with exciterne nr. All the stars were paler 
now than before, and where Rikud had seen the one bright central star, he now saw a globe of 
light, white with a tinge of blue 
in it, and so bright that it hurt 
his eyes to look. 

Yes, hurt! Rikud looked and 
looked until his eyes teared and 
he had to turn away. Here was 
an unknown factor which the perfect world failed to control. But 
how could a star change into a 
blinking blue-white globe — if, indeed, that was the star Rikud 
had seen earlier? There was that 
word change again. Didn't it have 



something to do with age? Rikud 
couldn't remember, and he suddenly wished he could read Crifer's book on astronomy, which 
meant the same as stars. Except 
that it was variable, which was 
like change, being tied up somehow with age. 

Presently Rikud became aware 
that his eyes were not tearing any 
longer, and he turned to look at 
the viewport. What he saw now 
was so new that he couldn't at 
first accept it. Instead, he blinked 
and rubbed his eyes, sure that the 
ball of blue-white fire somehow 
had damaged them. But the new 
view persisted. 

Of stars there were few, and of 
the blackness, almost nothing. 
Gone, too, was the burning globe. 
Something loomed there in the 
port, so huge that it spread out 
over almost the entire surface. 
Something big and round, all 
grays and greens and browns, 
and something for which Rikud 
had no name. 

A few moments more, and Rikud no longer could see the 
sphere. A section of it had expanded outward and assumed the 
rectangular shape of the viewport, and its size as well. It 
seemed neatly sheered down the 
middle, so that on one side Rikud 
saw an expanse of brown and 
green, and on the other, blue. 

Startled, Rikud leaped back. 
The sullen roar in the rear of the 



72 




 



world had ceased abruptly. Instead an ominous silence, broken 
at regular intervals by a sharp 
booming. 
Change — 
"Won't you eat, Rikud?" Chuls 
called from somewhere down below. 

"Damn the man," Rikud 
thought. Then aloud: "Yes, I'll 
eat. Later." 

"It's time . . Chuls' voice 
trailed off again, impotently. 

But Rikud forgot the old man 
completely. A new idea occurred 
to him, and for a while he struggled with it. What he saw — what 
he had always seen, except that 
now there was the added factor 
of change — perhaps did not exist 
in the viewport. 

Maybe it existed through the 
viewport. 

That was maddening. Rikud 
turned again to the port, where 
he could see nothing but an obscuring cloud of white vapor, 
murky, swirling, more confusing 
than ever. 

"Chuls," he called, remembering, "come here.'* 

"I am here," said a voice at his 
elbow. 

Rikud whirled on the little figure and pointed to the swirling 
cloud of vapor, "What do you 
see?" 

Chuls looked. "The viewport, 
of course." 
"What else?" 



"Else? Nothing." 

Anger welled up inside Rikud. 
"All right," he said, "listen. What 
do you hear?" 

"Broom, brroom, brrroom !" 
Chuls imitated the intermittent 
blasting of the engines. "I'm 
hungry, Rikud." 

The old man turned and strode 
off down the corridor toward the 
dining room, and Rikud was glad 
to be alone once more. 

NOW the vapor had departed, 
except for a few tenuous 
whisps. For a moment Rikud 
thought he could see the gardens 
rearward in the world. But that 
was silly. What were the gardens 
doing in the viewport? And besides, Rikud had the distinct feeling that here was something far 
vaster than the gardens, although 
all of it existed in the viewport 
which was no wider than the 
length of his body. The gardens, 
moreover, did not jump and 
dance before his eyes the way 
the viewport gardens did. Nor did 
they spin. Nor did the trees grow 
larger with every jolt. 

Rikud sat down hard. He 
blinked. 

The world had come to rest on 
the garden of the viewport. 

FOR a whole week that view 
did not change, and Rikud 
had come to accept it as fact. 
There — through the viewport and 



THE SENSE OF WONDER 



73 



in it — was a garden. A garden 
larger than the entire world, a 
garden of plants which Rikud had 
never seen before, although he 
had always liked to stroll through 
the world's garden and he had 
come to know every plant well. 
Nevertheless, it was a garden. 

He told Chuls, but Chuls had 
responded, "It is the, viewport.** 

Crifer, on the other hand, 
wasn't so sure. "It looks like the 
garden," he admitted to Rikud. 
"But why should the garden be 
in the viewport?" 

Somehow, Rikud knew this 
question for a healthy sign. But 
he could not tell them of his most 
amazing thought of all. The 
change in the viewport could 
mean only one thing. The world 
had been walking — the word 
seemed all wrong to Rikud, but 
he could think of no other, unless it were running. The world 
had been ^walking somewhere. 
That somewhere was the garden 
and the world had arrived. 

"It is an old picture of the garden," Chuls suggested, "and the 
plants are different." 

"Then they've changed?" 

"No, merely different." 

"Well, what about the viewport? It changed. Where are the 
stars? Where are they, Chuls, if 
it did not change?" 

"The stars come out at night." 

"So there is a change from day 
to night P* 



"I didn't say that. The stars 
simply shine at night. Why 
should they shine during the day 
when the world wants them to 
shine only at night?" 

"Once they shone all the time." 

"Naturally," said Crifer, becoming interested. "They are 
variable." 

"n IKUD regretted that he never 
had had the chance to read 
that book on astronomy. He 
hadn't been reading too much 
lately. The voice of the reading 
machine had begun to bore him. 
He said, "Well, variable or not, 
our whole perspective has 
changed." 

And when Chuls looked away 
in disinterest, Rikud became 
angry. If only the man would 
realize! If only anyone would 
realize! It all seemed so obvious. 
If he, Rikud, walked from one 
part of the world to another, it 
was with a purpose — to eat, or to 
sleep, or perhaps to bathe in the 
health -rays. Now if the world had 
walked from — somewhere, through 
the vast star-speckled darkness 
and to the great garden outside, 
this also was purposeful. The 
world had arrived at the garden 
for a reason. But if everyone lived 
as if the world still stood in 
blackness, how could they find 
the nature of that purpose? 

"I will eat," Chuls said, breaking Rikud's revery. 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Damn the man, all he did was 
eat! 

Yet he did have initiative after 
a sort. He knew when to eat. Because he was hungry. 

And Rikud, too, was hungry. 

Differently. 

HE had long wondered about 
the door in the back of the 
library, and now, as Crifer sat 
cross-legged on one of the dusty 
tables, reading machine and book 
on astronomy or stars in his lap, 
Rikud approached the door. 

"What's in here?" he demanded. 

"It's a door, I think," said 
Crifer. 

"I know, but what's beyond 
it?" 

"Beyond it? Oh, you mean 
through the door." 
"Yes." 

"Well," Crifer scratched bis 
bead, "I don't think anyone ever 
opened it. It's only a door." 

"I will," said Rikud. 

"You will what?" 

"Open it. Open the door and 
look inside." 

A long pause. Then, "Can you 
do it?" 

"I think so." 

"You can't, probably. How can 
anyone go where no one has been 
before? There's nothing. It just 
isn't. It's only a door, Rikud." 

"No — " Rikud began, but the 
words faded off into a sharp in


take of breath. Rikud had turned 
the knob and pushed! The door 
opened silently, and Crifer said, 
"Doors are variable, too, I think." 

Rikud saw a small room, perhaps half a dozen paces across, 
at the other end of which was another door, just like the first. 
Halfway across, Rikud heard a 
voice not unlike that of the 
reading machine. 

He missed the beginning, but 
then: 

— therefore, permit no unauthorized persons to go through this 
door. The macliinery in the next 
room is your protection against 
the rigors of space. A thousand 
years from now, journey's end, 
you may have discarded it for 
something better — who knows? 
But if you have not, then here is 
your protection. As nearly as possible, this ship is a perfect, selfsustaining world. It is more than 
that: it is human-sustaining as 
well. Try to hurt yourself and the 
ship will not permit it—within 
limits, of course. But you can 
damage the ship, and to avoid 
any possibility of that, no unauthorized persons are to be permitted through this door — 

Rikud gave the voice up as 
hopeless. There were too many 
confusing words. What in the 
world was an unauthorized person? More interesting than that, 



THE SENSE OF WONDER 



75 



however, was the second door. 
Would it lead to another voice? 
Rikud hoped that it wouldn't. . 

When he opened the door a 
strange new noise filled his ears, 
a gentle humming, punctuated by 
a throb-throb- throb which sounded not unlike the booming of the 
engines last week, except that this 
new sound didn't blast nearly so 
loudly against his eardrums. And 
what met Rikud's eyes — he 
blinked and looked again, but it 
was still there — cogs and gears 
and wheels and nameless things 
all strange and beautiful because 
they shone with a luster unfamiliar to him. 

"Odd," Rikud said aloud. Then 
he thought, "Now there's a good 
word, but no one quite seems to 
know its meaning." 

Odder stilt was the third door. 
Rikud suddenly thought there 
might exist an endless succession 
of them, especially when the third 
one opened on a bare tunnel 
which led to yet another door. 

Only this one was different. In 
it Rikud saw the viewport. But 
how? The viewport stood on the 
other end of the world. It did 
seem smaller, and, although it 
looked out on the garden, Rikud 
sensed that the topography was 
different. Then the garden extended even farther than he had 
thought. It was endless, extending all the way to a ridge of 
mounds way off in the distance. 



And this door one could walk 
through, into the garden. Rikud 
put his hand on the door, all the 
while watching the garden 
through the new viewport. He 
began to turn the handle. 

Then he trembled. 

What would he do out in the 
garden? 

He couldn't go alone. He'd die 
of the strangeness. It was a silly 
thought; no one ever died of anything until he was a hundred. 
Rikud couldn't fathom the rapid 
thumping of his heart. And Rikud's mouth felt dry; he wanted 
to swallow, but couldn't. 

Slowly, he took his hand off the 
door lever. He made his way back 
through the tunnel and then 
through the room of machinery 
and finally through the little 
room with the confusing voice 
to Crifer. 

By the time he reached the 
lame-footed man, Rikud was 
running. He did not dare once to 
look back. He stood shaking at 
Crifer's side, and sweat covered 
him in a clammy film. He never 
wanted to look at the garden 
again. Not when he knew there 
was a door through which he 
could walk and then might find 
himself in the garden. 

It was so big. 

*X*HREE or four days passed 
before Rikud calmed himself 
enough to talk about his experi


GALAXY SCIENCI FICTION 



ence. When he did, only Crifer 
seemed at all interested, yet the 
lame- footed man's mind was inadequate to cope with the situation. He suggested that the viewport might also be variable : and 
Rikud found himself wishing that 
his friend had never read that 
book on astronomy. 

Chuls did not believe Rikud at 
all, "There are not that many 
doors in the world," he said. "The 
library has a door and there is a 
door to the women's quarters; 
in five years, the Calculator will 
send you through that. But there 
are no others." 

Chuls smiled an indulgent 
smile and Rikud came nearer to 
him. "Now, by the world, there 
are two other doors!" 

Rikud began to shout, and 
everyone looked at him queerly. 

"What are you doing that for?" 
demanded Wilm, who was shorter 
even than Crifer, but had no lame 
foot. 

"Doing what?" 

"Speaking so loudly when 
Chuls, who is close, obviously has 
no trouble hearing you." 

"Maybe yelling will make him 
understand." 

Crifer hobbled about on his 
good foot, doing a meaningless 
little jig. "Why don't we go see?" 
he suggested. Then, confused, he 
frowned. 

"Well, I won't go," Chuls replied. "There's no reason to go. 



] f Rikud has been imagining 
things, why should I?" 

"I imagined nothing. I'll show 
you — " 

"You'll show me nothing because I won't go." 

Rikud grabbed Chuls' blouse 
with his big fist. Then, startled 
by what he did. his hands began 
to tremble. But he held on, and 
he tugged at the blouse. 

"Stop that," said the older 
man, mildly. 

CRIFER hopped up and down. 
"Look what Rikud's doing! I 
don't know what he's doing, but 
look. He's holding Chuls' blouse. 1 * 
"Stop that," repeated Chuls, 
his face reddening. 

"Only if you'll go with me.** 
Rikud was panting. 

Chuls tugged at his wrist. By 
this time a crowd had gathered. 
Some of them watched Crifer 
jump up and down, but most of 
them watched Rikud holding 
Chuls' blouse. 

"1 think I can do that," declared Wilm, clutching a fistful 
of Crifer's shirt. 

Presently, the members of the 
crowd had pretty well paired off, 
each partner grabbing for his 
companion's blouse. They giggled 
and laughed and some began to 
hop up and down as Crifer had 
done. 

A buzzer sounded and nuto

n 



matically Rikud found himself 
releasing Chuls. 

Chuls said, forgetting the incident completely, "Time to retire." 

In a moment, the room was 
cleared. Rikud stood alone. He 
cleared his throat and listened 
to the sound, all by itself in the 
stillness. What would have happened if they hadnH retired? But 
they always did things punctually like that, whenever the 
buzzer sounded. They ate with 
the buzzer, bathed in the healthrays with it, slept with it. 

What would they do if the 
buzzer stopped buzzing? 

This frightened Rikud, although he didn't know why. He'd 
like it, though. Maybe then he 
could take them outside with him 
to the big garden of the two viewports. And then he wouldn't be 
afraid because he could huddle 
close to them and he wouldn't be 
alone. 

"TJIKUD heard the throbbing 
*^*~ again as he stood in the room 
of the machinery. For a long time 
he watched the wheels and cogs 
and gears spinning and humming. 
He watched for he knew not how 
long. And then he began to wonder. If he destroyed the wheels 
and the cogs and the gears, would 
the buzzer stop? It probably 
would, because, as Rikud saw it, 
he was clearly an "unauthorized 
person." He had heard the voice 



again upon entering the room. 

He found a metal rod, bright 
and shiny, three feet long and 
half as wide as his arm. He tugged at it and it came loose from 
the wires that held it in place. 
He hefted it carefully for a moment, and then he swung the bar i 
into the mass of metal. Each 
time he heard a grinding, crashing sound. He looked as the gears 
and cogs and wheels crumbled 
under his blows, shattered by the 
strength of his arm. 

Almost casually he strode 
about the room, but his blows 
were not casual. Soon his easy 
strides had given way to frenzied 
running. Rikud smashed everything in sight. 

When the lights winked out, 
he stopped. Anyway, by that 
time the room was a shambles of 
twisted, broken metal. He laughed, softly at first, but presently 
he was roaring, and the sound 
doubled and redoubled in his ears 
because now the throbbing had 
stopped. 

He opened the door and ran 
through the little corridor to the 
smaller viewport. Outside he 
could see the stars, and, dimly, 
the terrain beneath them. But 
everything was so dark that only 
the stars shone clearly. All else 
was bathed in a shadow of unreality. 

Rikud never wanted to do anything more than he wanted to 




 



©pen that door. But his hands 
trenihh d too much when he 
touched it, and once, when he 
pressed his face close against the 
viewport, there in the darkness, 
something bright flashed briefly 
through the sky and was gone. 
Whimpering, he fled. 

A IX around Rikud were darkness and hunger and thirst. 
The buzzer did not sound because 
Rikud had silenced it forever. 
And no one went to eat or drink. 
Rikud himself had fumbled 
through the blackness and the 
whimpering to the dining room, 
his tongue "dry and swollen, but 
the smooth belt that flowed with 
water and with savory dishes did 
not run any more. The machinery, Rikud realized, also wps 
responsible for food. 

Chuls said, over and over, 
"I'm hungry." 

"We will eat and we will drink 
when the buzzer tells us," Wilm 
replied confidently. 

"It won't any more," Rikud 
said. 

'What won't?** 

"The buzzer will never sound 
Sgain. I broke it." 

Crifer growled. "I know. You 
shouldn't have done it. That was 
a bad thing you did, Rikud." 

"It was not bad. The world has 
moved through the blackness and 
the stars and now we should go 
outside to live in the big garden 



there beyond the viewport." 

"That's ridiculous," Chuls said. 

Even Crifer now was angry at 
Rikud. "He broke the buzzer and 
no one can eat. I hate Rikud, I 
think." 

There was a lot of noise in the 
darkness, and someone else said, 
"I hate Rikud." Then everyone 
was saying it. 

Rikud was sad. Soon he would 
die. because no one would go 
outside with him and he could not 
go outside alone. In five more 
years he would have had a 
woman, too. He wondered if it 
was dark and hungry in the 
women's quarters. Did women 
eat? 

Perhaps they ate plants. Once, 
jn the garden, Rikud had broken 
off a frond and tasted it. It had 
been bitter, but not unpleasant. 
Maybe the plants in the viewport 
would even be better. 

"We will not be hungry if we* 
go outside," he said. "We can 
eat there." 

"We can eat if the buzzer 
sounds, but it is broken," Chuls 
said dully. 

Crifer shrilled, "Maybe it is 
only variable and will buzz 
again." 

"No," Rikud assured him. "It 
won't." 

"Then you broke it and I hate 
you." said Crifer. "We should 
break you, too, to show you how 
it is to be broken.'* 



THE SENSE OF WONDER 



"We must go outside — through 
the viewport." Rikud listened to 
the odd gurgling sound his stomach made. 

A hand reached out in the 
darkness and grabbed at his head. 
He heard Crifer's voice. "I have 
Rikud's head." The voice was 
nasty, hostile. 

Crifer, more than anyone, had 
been his friend. But now that he 
had broken the machinery, Crifer 
was his enemy, because Crifer 
came nearer to understanding the 
situation than anyone except Rikud. 

The hand reached out again, 
and it struck Rikud hard across 



the face. "I hit him! I hit him!" 

Other hands reached out, and 
Rikud stumbled. He fell and then 
someone was on top of him, and 
he struggled. He rolled and was 
up again, and he did not like the 
sound of the angry voices. Someone said, "Let us do to Rikud 
what he said he did to the machinery." Rikud ran. In the 
darkness, his feet prodded many 
bodies. There were those who 
were too weak to rise. Rikud, too, 
felt a vstrange light-headedness 
and a gnawing hurt in Ms stomach. But it didn't matter. He 
heard the angry voices and the 
feet pounding behind him, and 




 




he wanted only to get away. 

It was dark and he was hungry 
and everyone who was strong 
enough to run was chasing him, 
but every time he thought of the 
garden outside, and how big it 
was, the darkness and the hunger 
and the people chasing him were 
unimportant. It was so big that 
it would swallow him up completely ond positively. 

He became sickly giddy thinking about it. 

But if he didn't open the door 
and go into the garden outside, 
he would die because he had no 
food and no water and his stomach gurgled and grumbled and 

THE SENSE OF WONDER 



hurt. And everyone was chasing 
him. 

He stumbled through the dark-, 
ness and felt his way back to the 
library, through the inner door 
and into the room with the voice 
— but the voice didn't speak this 
time — through its door and into 
the place of machinery. Behind 
him, he could hear the voices at 
the first door, and he thought for 
a moment that no one would 
come after him. But he heard 
Crifer yell something, and then 
feet pounding in the passage. 

Rikud tripped over something 
and sprawled awkwardly across 
the floor. He felt a sharp hurt in 

81 



his head, and when he reached up 
to touch it with, his hands there 
in the darkness, his fingers came 
iaway wet. 

He got up slowly and opened 
the next door. The voices behind 
him were closer now; Light 
streamed in through the viewport. A fter the darkness, it 
frightened Rikud and it made his 
■ eyes smart, and he could hear 
those behind him retreating to a 
safe distance. But their voices 
were not far away, and he knew 
they would come after him because they Wanted to break him. 

Rikud looked out upon the garden and he trembled. Out there 
was life. The garden stretched 
off in unthinkable immensity to 
the cluster of low mounds against 
the bright blue which roofed the 
many plants. If plants could live 
out there as they did within the 
world, then so could people. Rikud and his people should. This 
was why the world had moved 
across the darkness and the stars 
for all Rikud's lifetime and more. 
But he was afraid. 
11 He reached up and grasped the 
handle of the door and he saw 
that his fingers were red with the 
wetness which had come from 
his hurt head. Slowly he slipped 
to the cool floor — how his head 
was burning! — and for a long 
time he lay there, thinking he 
would never rise again. Inside he 
heard the voices again, and soon 



a foot and then another pounded 
on the metal of the passage. He 
heard Crifer's voice louder than 
the rest: "There is Rikud on the 
floor!" 

Tugging at the handle of the 
door, Rikud pulled himself upright. Something small and 
brown scurried across the other 
side of the viewport and Rikud 
imagined it turned to look at him 
with two hideous red eyes. 

Rikud screamed and hurtled 
back through the corridor, and 
his face was so terrible in the 
light streaming in through the 
viewport that everyone fled before him. He stumbled again in 
the place of the machinery, and 
down on his hands and knees he 
fondled the bits of metal which 
he could see in the dim light 
through the open door. 

"Where's the buzzer?" he sobbed. "I must find the buzzer." 

Crifer's voice, from the darkness inside, said, "You broke it. 
You broke it. And now we will 
break you — " 

Rikud got up and ran. He 
reached the door again and then 
he slipped down against it, exhausted. Behind him, the voices 
and the footsteps came, and soon 
he saw Crifer's head peer in 
through the passageway. Then 
there were others, and then they 
were walking toward him. 

His head whirled and the viewport seemed to swim in a haze.

Could it be variable, as Crifer 
had suggested? He wondered if 
the scurrying brown thing waited 
somewhere, and nausea struck at 
the pit of his stomach. But if the 
plants could live out there and 
the scurrying thing could live 
and that was why the world had 
moved through the blackness, 
then so could he live out there, 
and Crifer and all the others . . 
So tightly did he grip the handle that his ringers began to hurt. 
And his heart pounded hard and 
he felt the pulses leaping on either 
side of his neck. 

He stared out into the garden, 
and off into the distance, where 
the blue-white globe which might 
have been a star stood just above 
the row of mounds. 

CRIFER was tugging at him, 
trying to pull him away from 
the door, and someone was grabbing at his legs, trying to make 
him fall. He kicked out and the 
hands let go, and then he turned 
the handle and shoved the weight 
of his body with all his strength 
against the door. 

It opened and he stepped outside into the warmth. 

The air was fresh, fresher than 
any air Rikud had ever breathed. 
He walked around aimlessly, 
touching the plants and bending down to feel the floor, and 
sometimes he looked at the blue


white globe on the horizon. It was 
all very beautiful. 

Near the ship, water that did * 
not come from a machine gurgled 
across the land, and Rikud lay 
down and drank. It was cool and 
good, and when he got up, Crifer 
and Wilm were outside the world, 
and some of the others followed. 
They stood around for a long 
time before going to the water to 
drink. 

Rikud sat down and tore off a 
piece of a plant, munching on it. 
It was good. 

Crifer picked his head up_ from 
the water, his chin wet. "Even 
feelings are variable. I don't hate 
you now, Rikud." 

Rikud smiled, staring at the 
ship. "People are variable, too, 
Crifer. That is, if those creatures 
coming from the ship are people." 

"They're women," said Crifer. 

They we re # strangely shaped in 
some ways, and yet in others 
completely human, and their 
voices were high, like singing. 
Rikud found them oddly exciting. He liked them. He liked the 
garden, for all its hugeness. With 
so many people, and especially 
now with women, he was not 
afraid. 

It was much better than the 
small world of machinery, buzzer, 
frightening doors and women by 
appointment only. 

Rikud felt at home.

If YOU WAS A MOKLIM 



H 



ship is ever going to make to 
Moklin. 

Up to that very morning everything is serene, and that morning 
I am sitting on the trading post 
porch, not doing a thing but sitting there and breathing happy. 
I'm looki ng at a Mokli n ki d . 
She's about the size of. a human 
six-year-old and she is playing 
in a mud puddle while her folks 
are trading in the post. She is a 
cute kid — mighty human-looking. 
She has long whiskers like Old 
Man Bland, who's the first human to open a trading post and 
learn to talk to Moklins. 

Moklins think a lot of Old 
Man Bland. They build him a 
big tomb, Moklin-style, when he 
dies, and there is more Moklin 
kids born with long whiskers than 
you can shake a stick at. And 
everything looks okay. Everything! s 

Sitting there on the porch, I 
hear a Moklin talking inside the 
trade room. Talking English just 
as good as anybody. He says to 
Deeth, our Moklin trade-clerk, 
"But Deeth, I can buy this 
cheaper over at the other trading 
post! Why should I pay more 
here?" 

Deeth says, in English too, "I 
can't help that. That's the price 
here. You pay it or you don't. 
That's all." 

I just sit there breathing complacent, thinking how good things 



are. Here I'm Joe Brinkley, and 
me and Brooks are the Company 
on Moklin — only humans rate as 
Company employees and get pensions, of course — and I'm thinking sentimental about how much 
humaner Moklins are getting 
every day and how swell everything is. 

The six-year-old kid gets up 
out of the mud puddle, and 
wrings out her whiskers — they 
are exactly like the ones on the 
picture of Old Man Bland in the 
trade room — and she goes trotting off down the road after her 
folks. She is mighty human-looking, that one. 

The wild ones don't look near 
so human. Those that live in the 
forest are greenish, and have 
saucer eyes, and their noses can 
wiggle like an Earth rabbit. You 
wouldn't think they're the same 
breed as the trading post Moklins at all, but they are. They 
crossbreed with each other, only 
the kids look humaner than their 
parents and are mighty near the 
same skin color as Earth men, 
which is plenty natural when you 
think about it, but nobody does. 
Not up to then, 

I don't think about that then, 
or anything else. Not even about 
the reports Brooks keeps sweating over and sending off with 
every Company ship. I am just 
sitting there contented when I 
notice that Sally, the tree that 




 



shades the trading post porch. 
Starts pulling up her roots. She 
gets them coiled careful and 
starts marching off. I see the 
other trees are moving off, too, 
clearing the landing field. They're 
waddling away to leave a free 
space, and they're pushing and 
shoving, trying to crowd each 
other, and the little ones sneak 
under the big ones and they all 
act peevish. Somehow they know 
a ship is coming in. That's what 
their walking off means, anyhow. 
But there ain't a ship due in for 
a month, yet. 

They're clearing the landing 
field, though, so I start listening 
for a ship's drive, even if I don't 
believe it. At first I don't hear a 
thing. It must be ten minutes before I hear a thin whistle, and 
right after it the heavy drone 
that's the ground -repulsor units 
pushing against bedrock underground. Lucky they don't push 
on wet stuff, or a ship would sure 
mess up the local countryside! 

I get off my chair and go out 
to look. Sure enough, the old 
Palmyra comes bulging down out 
of the sky, a month ahead of 
schedule, and the trees over at 
the edge of the field shove each 
other all *round to make room. 
The ship drops, hangs anxious 
ten feet up, and then kind of sighs 
and lets down. Then there's Moklins running out of everywhere, 
Waving cordial. 



They sure do like humans, 
these Moklins! Humans are their \ 
idea of what people should be 
like! Moklins will wrestle the: 
freight over to the trading post 
while others are climbing over 
everything that's waiting to go' 
off. all set to pass it up to the 
ship and hoping to spot friends 
they've made in the crew. If they 
can get a human to go home with 
them and visit while the ship is 
down, they brag about it for 
weeks. And do they treat their 
guests swell! 

They got fancy Moklin clothes 
for them to wear ■ — soft, silky 
guest garments — and they got 
Moklin fruits and Moklin drinks 
— you ought to taste them! And 
when the humans have to go back 
to the* ship at takeoff time, the 
Moklins bring them back with 
flower wreaths all over them. 

Humans is tops on Moklin. 
And Moklins get humaner every 
day. There's Deeth, our clerk. 
You couldn't hardly tell him 
from .human, anyways. He looks 
like a human named Casey that 
used to be at the trading post, 
and he's got a flock of brothers 
and sisters as human-looking as 
he is. You'd swear — 

But this is the last time but 
one that a Harth ship is going to 
land on Moklin, though nobody 
knows it yet. Her passenger port 
opens up and Captain Haney 
gets out. The Moklins yell cheer- : 



IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN 



87 



ful when they see him. He waves 
a hand and helps a human girl 
out. She has red hair and a sort 
of businesslike air about her. The 
Moklins wave and holler and 
grin. The girl looks at them funny, and Cap Haney explains 
something, but she sets her hps. 
Then the Moklins run out a 
freight -truck, and Haney and the 
girl get on it, and they come 
racing over to the post, the Moklins pushing and pulling them 
and making a big fuss of laughing and hollering — all so friendly, 
it would make anybody feel good 
inside. Moklins like humans! 
They admire them tremendous! 
They do everything they can 
think of to be human, and they're 
smart, but sometimes I get- cold 
shivers when I think how close a 
thing it turns out to be. 

Cap Haney steps off the 
freight-truck and helps the girl 
down. Her eyes are blazing. She 
is the maddest-looking female I 
ever see, but pretty as they make 
them, with that red hair " and 
those blue eyes staring at me hostile. 

"Hiya, Joe," says Cap Haney. 
"Where's Brooks?" 
. I tell him. Brooks is poking 
©round in the mountains up back 
of the post. He is jumpy and 
worried and peevish, and he acts 
like he's trying to find something 
that ain't there, but he's bound 
he's going to find it regardless. 



"Too bad he's not here," says 
Haney. He turns to the girl. "This 
is Joe Brinkley," he says. "He's 
Brooks' assistant. And, Joe, this 
is Inspector Caldwell — Miss 
Caldwell." 

"Inspector will do," says the 
girl, cuVt. She looks at me accusing. "I'm here to check into this 
matter of a competitive trading 
post on Moklin." 

."Oh," I says. "That's bad busi-, 
ness. But it ain't cut into our 
trade much. In fact, I don't think 
it's cut our trade at all." 

"Get my baggage ashore, Captain," says Inspector Caldwell, 
imperious. "Then you can go 
about your business. I '11 stay 
here until you stop on your return trip." 

I call, "Hey, Deeth!" But he's 
right behind me. He looks respectful and admiring at the girl. 
You'd swear he's human! He's 
the spit and image of Casey, who 
used to be on Moklin until six 
years back. 

"Yes, sir," says Deeth. He says 
to the girl, "Yes, ma'am. I'll show 
you your quarters, ma'arn, and 
your baggage will get there right 
away. This way, ma'am." 

He leads her off, but he don't 
have to send for her baggage. A 
pack of Moklins come along, 
dragging it, hopeful of having her 
say "Thank you" to them for it. 
There hasn't ever been a human 
woman on Moklin before, and 




 



they arc all excited- I bet if there 
had been women around before, 
there'd have been hell loose before, too. But now the Moklins 
just hang around, admiring. 

There are kids with whiskers 
like Old Man Bland, and other 
kids with mustaches — male and 
female both — and all that sort of 
stuff. I'm pointing out to Cap 
Haney some kids that bear a remarkable resemblance to him and 
he's saying, "Well, what do you 
know!" when Inspector Caldwell 
comes back. 

"What are you waiting for, 
Captain?" she asks, frosty. 

"The ship usually grounds a 
few hours," I explain. "These 
Moklins are such friendly critters, we figure it makes good wi'l 
for the trading post for the crew 
to be friendly with 'em." 

"I doubt," says Inspector Caldwell, her voice dripping icicles, 
"that I shall advise that that custom be continued." 

Cap Haney shrugs his shoulders and. goes off, so I know Inspector Caldwell is high up in 
the Company. She ain't old, maybe in her middle twenties, I'd say, 
but the Caldwell family practically owns the Company, and all 
the nephews and cousins and so 
on get put into a special school so 
they can go to work in the family 
firm. They get taught pretty 
good, and most of them really 
rate the good jobs they get. Any


how, there's plenty of good jobs* 
The Company runs twenty of 
thirty solar systems and it's run 
pretty tight. Being a Caldwell 
means you get breaks, but you 
got to live up to them. 

Cap Haney almost has to fight 
his way through the Moklins who 
want to give him flowers and 
fruits and such. Moklins are sure 
crazy about humans! He gets to 
the entry port and goes in, and 
the door closes and the Moklins 
pull back. Then the Palmyra 
booms. The ground-repulsor unit 
is on. She heaves up, like she ia 
grunting, and goes bulging up 
into the air, and the humming 
gets deeper and deeper, and fainter and fainter — and suddenly 
there's a keen whistling and she'9 
gone. It's all very normal. Nobody would guess that this is the 
last time but one a Earth ship 
will ever lift off Moklin! 

Inspector Caldwell taps her 
foot, icy. ''When will you send for 
Mr. Brooks?" she demands. 

"Right away," I says to her. 
"Deeth — " 

"I sent a runner for him, 
ma'am," says Deeth. "If he was 
in hearing of the ship's landing, 
he may be on the way here now." 

He bows and goes in the trade 
room. There are Moklins that 
came to see the ship land, and 
now have tramped over to do 
some trading. Inspector Caldwell 
jumps. 



IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN 



"Wh-what's that?" she asks, , 
tense. 

The trees that crowded off the 
field to make room for the Patmyra are waddling back. I realize 
for the first time that it might 
look funny to somebody just 
landed on Moklin. They are regular-looking trees, in a way. They 
got bark and branches and so on. 
Only they can put their roots 
down into holes they make in the 
ground, and that's the way they 
stay, mostly. But they can move. 
Wild ones, when there's a water 
shortage or they get too crowded 
or mad with each other, they pull 
up their roots and go waddling 
around looking for a better place 
to take root in. 

The trees on our landing field 
have learned that every so often 
a ship xs going to land and they've 
got to make room for it. But now 
the ship is gone, and they're 
lurching back to their places. The 
younger ones are waddling faster 
than the big ones, though, and 
taking the best places, and the old 
grunting trees are waving their 
branches indignant and puffing 
after them mad as hell. 

I explain what is happening. 
Inspector Caldwell just stares. 
Then Sally comes lumbering up. 
I got a friendly feeling for Sally. 
She's pretty old — her trunk is all 
of three feet thick— but she always puts out a branch to shade 
my window in the morning, and 




*3 




 



I never let any other tree take 
her place. She conies groaning 
up, and uncoils her roots, and 
sticks them down one by one into 
the holes she'd left, and sort of 
scrunches into place and looks 
peaceful. 

"Aren't they — dangerous?" 
asks Inspector Caldwell, pretty 
uneasy. 

"Not a bit," I says. "Things 
can change on Moklin. They 
don't have to fight. Things fight 
in other places because they can't 
change and they get crowded, and 
that's the only way they can meet 
competition. But there's a special kind of evolution on Moklin. 
Cooperative, you might call it. 
It's a nice place to live. Only 
thing is everything matures so 
fast. Four years and a Moklin is 
grown up, for instance." 

She sniffs. "What about that 
other trading post?" she says, 
sharp. "Who's back of it? The 
Company is supposed to have exclusive trading rights here. Who's 
trespassing?" 

"Brooks is trying to find out," 
I says. "They got a good complete line of trade goods, but the 
Moklins always say the humans 
running the place have gone off 
somewhere, hunting and such. 
We ain't seen any of them." 

"No?" says the girl, short. '*TU 
see them! We can't have competition in our exclusive territory! 

The rest of Mr. Brooks' re


ports — " She stops. Then she 
says, "That clerk of yours reminds me of someone I know." 

"He's a Moklin," I explain, 
"but he looks like a Company 
man named Casey. Casey's Area 
Director over on Khatim Two 
now, but he used to be here, and 
Deeth is the spit and image of 
him." 

"Outrageous!" says Inspector 
Caldwell, looking disgusted. 

There's a couple of trees pushing hard at each other. They are 
fighting, tree-fashion, for a specially good place. And there's 
others waddling around, mad as 
hell, because somebody else beat 
them to the spots they liked. I 
watch them. Then I grin, becauce 
a couple of young trees duck under the fighting big ones and set 
their roots down in the place the 
big trees was fighting over. 

"I don't like your attitude!" 
says Inspector Caldwell, furious. 

She goes stamping into the 
post, leaving me puzzled. What's 
wrong with me smiling at those 
kid trees getting the best of their 
betters? 

THAT afternoon Brooks comes 
back, marching ahead of a 
pack of woods-Moklins with 
greenish skins and saucer eyeg 
that've been guiding him around. 
He's a good-looking kind of fellow, Brooks is, with a good build 
and a solid jaw. 



IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN 



When he comes out of the 
woods on the landing field — the 
trees are all settled down by then 
—he's striding impatient and 
loose -jointed. With the woodsMoklins trailing him, he looks 
plenty dramatic, like a visi-reel 
picture of a explorer on some unknown planet, coming back from 
the dark and perilous forests, followed by the strange natives who 
do not yet know whether th is 
visitor from outer space is a god 
or what. You know the stuff. 

I see Inspector Caldwell take 
a good look at him, and I see her 
eyes widen. She looks like he is 
a shock, and not a painful one. 

He blinks when he sees her. 
He grunts, "What's tins? A sheMoklin?" 

Inspector Caldwell draws herself up to her full five-foot-three. 
She bristles. 

I say quick. "This here is Inspector Caldwell that the Palmyra dumped off here today. LTh 
— Inspector, this is Brooks, the 
Head Trader." 

They shake hands. He looks at 
her and says, "I'd lost hope my 
reports would ever get any attention paid to them. You've 
come to check my report that the 
trading post on Moklin has to be 
abandoned?" 

"I have not!" says Inspector 
Caldwell, sharp. "That's absurd! 
This planet has great potentialities, this post is profitable and 



the natives are friendly, and the 
trade should continue to increase. 
The Board is even considering the 
introduction of special crops." 

That strikes me as a bright 
idea. I'd like to see what would 
happen if Moklins started cultivating "hew kinds of plants! It 
would be a thing to watch — with 
regular Moklin plants seeing 
Strangers getting good growing 
places and special attention! I 
can't even guess what'll happen, 
but I want to watch! 

"What I want to ask right off," 
says Inspector Caldwell, fierce, 
"is why you have allowed a competitive trading post to be established, why you did not report it 
sooner, and why you haven't 
identified the company back of 
it?" 

Brooks stares at her. He gets 
mad. 

"Hell!" he says. "My reports 
cover all that! Haven't you read 
them?" 

"Of course not," says Inspector 
Caldwell. "I was given an outline 
of the situation here and told to 
investigate and correct it." 

"Oh!" says Brooks. "That's 
it!" 

Then he looks like he's swallowing naughty words. It is funny 
to see them glare at each other, 
both of them looking like they 
are seeing something that interests them plenty, but throwing 
off angry sparks just the same. 




 



"If you'll show me samples of 
their trade goods," says Inspector 
Caldwell, arrogant, "and I hope 
you can do that much, I'll identify the trading company handling them!" 

He grins at her without amusement and leads the way to the 
inside of the trading post. We 
brin g out the stuff we've had 
some of our Moklins go over and 
buy for us. Brooks dumps the 
goods on a table and stands back 
to see what she'll make of them, 
grinning with the same lack of 
mirth. She picks up a visi-reel 
projector. 

"Hmm," she says, scornful. 
"Not very good quality. It's . , ." 
Then she stops. She picks up a 
forest knife. "This," she says, "is 
a product of — " Then she stops 
again. She picks up some cloth 
and fingers it. 'She really steams. 
"I see!" she says, angry. "Because we have been on this planet 
so long and the Moklins are used 
to our goods, the people of the 
other trading post duplicate 
them! Do they cut prices?" 

"Fifty per cent," says Brooks. 

U chime in, "But we ain't lost 
much trade. Lots of Moklins still 
trade with us, out of friendship. 
Friendly folks, these Moklins." 

Just then Deeth comes in, looking just like Casey that used to 
be here on Moklin. He grins at 
me. 

"A girl just brought you a com


pliment," he lets me know. 

"Shucks!" I says, embarrassed 
and pleased. "Send her in and get 
a present for her." 

Deeth goes out. Inspector 
Caldwell hasn't noticed. She's 
seething over that other trading 
company copying our trade goods 
and underselling us on a planet 
we're supposed to have exclusive. 
Brooks looks at her grim. 

"I shall look over their post,** 
she announces, fierce, "and if they 
want a trade war, they'll get one! 
We can cut prices if we need to 
— we have all the resources of the 
Company behind us!" 

Brooks seems to be steaming 
on his own, maybe because she 
hasn't read his reports. But just 
then a Moklin girl comes in. Not 
bad-looking, either. You can see 
she is a Moklin — she ain't as 
convincing human as Deeth is, 
say — but she looks pretty human, 
at that. She giggles at me. 

"Compliment," she says, and 
shows me what she's carrying. 

I look. It's a Moklin kid, a 
boy, just about brand-new. And 
it has my shape ears, and its nose 
looks like somebody had stepped 
on it — my nose is that way — and 
it looks like a very small-sized 
working model of me. I chuck it 
under the chin and say, "Kitchycoo!" It gurgles at me. 

"What's your name?" I ask the 
girl. 

She tells me. I don't remember 



IF YOU WAS A MOKIIN 



ft, and I don't remember ever seeing her before, but she's paid me 
a compliment, all right — Moktfnstyle. 

"Mighty nice,*' I say. "Cute as 
atl get-out. I hope he grows up 
to have more sense than I got, 
though." Then Deeth comes in. 
with a armload of trade stuff like 
Old Man Bland gave to the ftrst 
Moklin kid that was born with 
long whiskers like his, and I say, 
"Thanks for the compliment. I 
am greatly honored." 

She takes the stuff and giggles 
again, and goes out. The kid 
beams at me over her shoulder 
and waves its fist. Mighty humanlike. A right cute kid, any 
way you look at it. 

Then I hear a noise. Inspector 
Caldwell is regarding me with 
loathing in her eyes. 

"Did you say they were friendly creatures?" she asks, bittef- "I 
think affectionate would be a better word V* Her voice shakes. 
"You are going to be transferred 
Out of here the instant the Pafmyra gets back!" 

"What's the matter?" I ask, 
surprised. "She paid me a compliment and I gave her a present. 
It's a custom. She's satisfied. I 
never see her before that I remember." 

"You don't?" she says. "The — 
th e callousness f You' re revol t ing!" 

j Brooks begins to sputter, then. 



he snickers, and all of a sudden 
he's howling with laughter. He is 
laughing at Inspector Caldwell. 
Then I get it, and I snort. Then 
I hoot and holler. It gets funnier 
when she gets madder still. She 
near blows up from being mad! 

We must look crazy, the two 
of us there in the post, just hollering with laughter while she 
gets furiouser and furiouser. Finally I have to lay down on the 
floor to laugh more comfortable. 
You see, she doesn't get a bit of 
what I've told her about there 
being a special kind of evolution 
on Moklin. The more disgusted 
and furious she looks at me, the 
harder I have to laugh. I can't 
help it 

WHEN wc set out for the other 
trading post next day, the 
atmosphere ain't what you'd call 
exactly cordial. There is just the 
Inspector and me, with Deeth 
and a couple of other Moklins 
for the look of things. She has on 
a green forest suit, and with her 
red hair she sure looks good! But 
she looks at me cold when Brooks 
says I'll take her over to the other 
post, and she doesn't say a word 
the first mile or two. 

We trudge on, and presently 
Deeth and the others get ahead 
so they can't hear what she says. 
And she remarks indignant, "I 
must say Mr. Brooks isn't very 
cooperative. Why didn't he come 



N 




 



with me? Is he afraid of the men 
at the other post?" 

"Not him," I says. "He's a 
good guy. But you got authority 
over him and you ain't read his 
reports." # 

"If I have authority," she says, 
sharp, "I assure you it's because 
I'm competent!" 

"I don't doubt it," I says. "If 
you wasn't cute^ he wouldn't care. 
But a man don't want a goodlooking girl giving him orders. He 
wants to give them to her. A 
homely woman, it don't matter." 

SHE tosses her head, but it 
don't displease her. Then she 
says, "What's in the reports that 
1 should have read?" 

"I don't know," I admit. "But 
he's been sweating over them. It 
makes him mad that nobody 
bothered to read 'em." 

"Maybe," she guesses, "it was 
what I need to know about this 
other trading post. What do you 
know about it, Mr. Brinkley?" 

I tell her what Deeth has told 
Brooks. Brooks found out about 
it because one day some Moklins 
come in to trade and ask friendly 
why we charge so much for this 
and that. Deeth told them we'd 
always charged that, and they 
say the other trading post sells 
things cheaper, and Deeth says 
what trading post? So they up 
and tell him there's another post 
that sells the same kind of things 



we do, only cheaper. But that's 

all they'll say. 

So Brooks tells Deeth to 6nd 
out, and he scouts around and 
comes back. There is another 
trading post only fifteen miles 
away, and it is selling stuff just 
like ours. And it charges only 
half price. Deeth didn't see the 
men — just the Moklin clerks. We 
ain't been able to see the m< a 
either. 

"Why haven't you seen the 
men?" 

"Every time Brooks or me go 
over/' I explain, "the Moklins 
they got working for them say 
the other men are off somewhere. 
Maybe the're starting some more 
posts. We wrote 'era a note, asking what the hell they mean, but 
they never answered it. Of course, 
we ain't seen their books &r their 
living quarters — " 

"You could find out plenty by 
a glimpse at their books!" she 
snaps. "Why haven't you just 
marched in and made the Moklins show you what you want to 
know, since the men were away?" 

"Because," I says, patient, 
"Moklins imitate humans. If we 
start trouble, they'll start it too. 
We can't set a example of rough 
stuff like burglary, mayhem, 
breaking and entering, manslaughter, or bigamy, or those 
Moklins will do just like us." 

"Bigamy!" She grabs on that 
sardonic. "If you're trying to 



IP YCU WAS A MOKLIN

make me think you've got enough 
moral sense — " 

I get a little mad. Brooks and 
me, we've explained to her, careful, how it is admiration and the 
way evolution works on Moklin 
that makes Moklin kids get born 
With long whiskers and that the 
compliment the Moklin girl has 
paid me is just exactly that. But 
she hasn't listened to a word. 

"Miss Caldwell," I says, 
"Brooks and me told you the 
facts. We tried to tell them delicate, to spare your feelings. Now 
if you'll try to spare mine, I'll 
thank you." 

"If you mean your finer feelings," she says, sarcastic, "I'll 
spare them as soon as I find 
some!" 

So I shut up. There's no use 
trying to argue with a woman. 
We tramp on through the forest 
without a word. Presently we 
come on a nest -bush. It's a pretty 
big one. There are a couple dozen 
nests on it, from the little-bitty 
bud ones no bigger than your 
fist, to the big ripe ones lined 
with soft stuff that have busted 
Open and have got cacklebirds 
housekeeping in them now. 

There are two cacklebirds sitting on a branch by the nest that 
is big enough to open up and 
have eggs laid in it, only it ain't. 
The cacklebirds are making 
noises like they are cussing it and 
telling it to hurry up and open. 



because they are in a hurry. 

"That's a nest-bush," I says. 
"It grows nests for the cacklebirds. The birds — uh — fertilize 
the ground around it. They're 
sloppy feeders and drop a lot of 
stuff th^t rots and is fertilizer too. 
The nest -bush and the cacklebirds kind of cooperate. That's 
the way evolution works on Moklin, like Brooks and me told you." 

She tosses that red head of 
hers and stamps on, not saying 
a word. So we get to the other 
trading post. And there she gets 
one of these slow-burning, longlasting mads on that fill a guy 
like me with awe. 

There's only Moktins at the 
other trading post, as usual. They 
say the humans are off somewhere. They look at her admiring 
and polite. They show her their 
stock. It is practically identical 
with ours — only they admit that 
they've sold out of some items 
because their prices are low. They 
act most respectful and pleased 
to see her. 

But she don't learn a thing 
about where their stuff comes 
from or what company is horning 
in on Moklin trade. And she looks 
at their head clerk and she burns 
and burns. 

WHEN we get back. Brooks 
is sweating over memorandums he has made, getting another report ready for the next 



9f> 




 



Company ship. Inspector Caldwell marches into the trade room 
and gives orders in a controlled, 
venomous voice. Then she marches right in on Brooks. 

"I have just ordered the Moklin sales force to cut the price on 
all items on sale by seventy-five 
per cent," she says, her voice 
trembling a little with fury. "I 
have also ordered the credit given 
for Moklin trade goods to be 
doubled. They want a trade war? 
They'll get it!" 

SHE is a lot madder than business would account for. 
Brooks says, tired, "I'd like to 
show you some facts. I've been 
over every inch of territory in 
thirty miles, looking for a place 
where a ship could land for that 
other post. There isn't any. Does 
that mean anything to you?" 

"The post is there, isn't 
it?" she says. "And they have 
trade goods, haven't they? And 
we have exclusive trading rights 
on Moklin, haven't we? That's 
enough for me. Our job is to 
drive them out of business!" 

But she is a lot madder than 
business would account for. 
Brooks says, very weary, "There's 
nearly a whole planet where they 
could have put another trading 
post. They could have set up 
shop on the other hemisphere 
and charged any price they 
pleased. But they set up shop 



right next to us! Does that make 

sense?" 

"Setting up close," she says, 
"would furnish them with customers already used to human 
trade goods. And it furnished 
them with Moklins trained to be 
interpreters and clerks ! And — " 
Then it come out, what she's raging, boiling, steaming, burning up 
about. "And," she says, furious, 
"it furnished them with a Moklin 
head-clerk who is a very handsome young man, Mr. Brooks! 
He not only resembles you in 
every feature, but he even has a 
good many of your mannerisms. 
You should be very proud!" 

With this she slams out of the 
room. Brooks blinks. 

"She won't believe anything," 
he says, sour, "except only that 
man is vile. Is that true about a 
Moklin who looks like me?" 

I nod. 

"Funny his folks never showed 
him to me for a complimentpresent!" Then he stares at me, 
hard. "How good is the likeness?" 

"If he is wearing your clothes," 
I tell him, truthful, "I'd^wear he 
is you." 

Then Brooks — slow, very slow 
- — turns white. "Remember the 
time you went off with Deeth 
and his folks, hunting? That was 
the time a Moklin got killed. 
You were wearing guest garments, weren't you?" 

I feel queer inside, but I nod. 



IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN 



97 



Guest garments, for Moklins, arc 
like the best bedroom and the 
drumstick of the chicken among 
humans. And a Moklin hunting 
party is something. They go 
hunting garlikthos, which you 
might as well call dragons, because they've got scales and they 
fly and they are tough babies. 

The way to hunt them is you 
take along some cacklebirds that 
ain't nesting — they are no good 
for anything while they're honeymooning—and the cacklebirds go 
flapping around until a garlikthos 
comes after them, and then they 
go jet-streaking to where the 
hunters are, cackling a blue 
streak to say, "Here 1 come, boys! 
Hold everything until I get past!" 
Then the garlikthos dives after 



them and the hunters get it as 
it dives. 

You give the cacklebirds its innards, and they sit around and 
eat, cackling to each other, zestful, like they're bragging about 
the otker times they done the 
same thing, only better. 

"You were wearing guest garments?" repeats Brooks, grim. 

I feel very queer inside, but I 
nod again. Moklin guest garments are mighty easy on the 
skin and feel mighty good. They 
ain't exactly practical hunting 
clothes, but the Moklins feel bad 
if a human that's their guest don't 
wear them. And of course he has 
to shed his human clothes to 
wear them. 

"What's the idea?" I want to 





 



know. But I feel pretty unhappy 
inside. 

"You didn't come back for one 
day, in the middle of the hunt, 
after tobacco and a bath?" 

"No," I says, beginning to get 
rattled. "We were way over at 
the Thunlib Hilts. We buried the 
dead Moklin over there and had 
a hell of a time building a tomb 
over him. Why?" 

"During that week," says 
Brooks, grim, "and while you 
were off wearing Moklin guest 
garments, somebody came back 
wearing your clothes — and got 
some tobacco and passed the time 
of day and went off again. Joe, 
just like there's a Moklin you say 
could pass for me, there's one 
that could pass for you. In fact, 



he did. Nobody suspected either.** 
I get panicky. "But what'd he 
do that for?" I want to know. 
"He didn't steal anything! Would 
he have done it just to brag to 
the other Moklins that he fooled 
you?" 

"He might," says Brooks, 
"have been checking to see if he 
could fool me. Or Captain Haney 
of the Palmyra. Or — " 

He looks at me. I feel myself 
going numb. This can mean one 
hell of a mess! 

"I haven't told you before," 
says Brooks, "but I've been 
guessing at something like this. 
Moklins like to be human, and 
they get human kids — kids that 
look human, anyway. Maybe 
they can want to be smart like 



IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN 



humans, and they are." He tries 
to grin, and can't. "That rival 
trading post looked fishy to me 
right at the start. They're practicing with that. It shouldn't be 
there at all, but it is. You see?" 

I feel weak and sick all over. 
This is a dangerous sort of thing! 
But I say quick, "If you mean 
they got Moklins that could pass 
for you and me, and they're figuring to bump us off and take 
our places — I don't believe that! 
Moklins like humans! They 
wouldn't harm humans for anything!" 

Brooks don't pay any attention. He says, harsh, "I've been 
trying to persuade the Company 
that we've got to get out of here, 
fast! And they send this Inspector 
Caldwell, who's not only female, 
but a redhead to boot! All they 
think about is a competitive trading post! And all she sees is that 
we're a bunch of lascivious scoundrels, and since she's a woman 
there's nothing that'll convince 
her otherwise!" 

Then something hits me. It 
looks hopeful. 

"She's the first human woman 
to land on Moklin. And she has 
got red hair. It's the first red hair 
the Moklins ever saw. Have we 
got time?" 

He figures. Then he says, 
"With luck, it ought to turn up! 
You've hit it!" And then his expression sort of softens. "If that 



happens — poor kid, she's going to 
take it hard! Women hate to be 
wrong. Especially redheads! But 
that might be the saving of — of 
humanity, when you think of it." 

I blink at him. He goes on, 
fi erce , "Look , Vm no Mokl i n ! 
You kHow that. But if there's a 
Moklin that looks enough like 
me to take my place . . . You see? 
We got to think of Inspector 
Caldwell, anyhow. If you ever 
see me cross my fingers, you wiggle your little finger. Then I 
Jihow it's you. And the other way 
about. Get it? You swear you'll 
watch over Inspector Caldwell?" 

"Sure!" I say. "Of course!" 

I wiggle my little linger. He 
crosses his. It's a signal nobody 
but us two would know. I feel a 
lot better. 

T> ROOKS goesr off next morning, grim, to visit the other 
trading post and see the Moklin 
that looks so much like him. Inspector Caldwell goes along, fierce, 
and I'm guessing it's to see the 
fireworks when Brooks sees his 
Moklin double that she thinks is 
more than a coincidence. Which 
she is right, only not in the way 
she thinks. 

Before they go, Brooks crosses 
his fingers and looks at me significant. I wiggle my little finger 
back at him. They go off. 

I sit down in the shade of Sally 
and try to think things out. I 



Too 




 



am all churned up inside, and 
scared as hell. It's near two weeks 
to landing time, when the old 
Palmyra ought to come bulging 
down out of the sky with a load 
of new trade goods. I think wistful about how swell everything 
has been on Moklin up to now, 
and how Moklins admire humans, and how friendly everything has been, and how it's a 
great compliment for Moklins to 
want to be like humans, and to 
get like them, and how no Moklin would ever dream of hurting 
a human and how they imitate 
humans joyous and reverent and 
happy. Nice people, Moklins. 
But— 

The end of things is in sight. 
Liking humans has made Moklins smart, but now there's been 
a slip-up. Moklins will do anything to produce kids that look 
like humans. That's a compliment. But no human ever sees a 
Moklin that's four or five years 
old and all grown up and looks 
so much like him that nobody 
can tell them apart. That ain't 
scheming. It's just that Moklins 
like humans, but they're scared 
the humans might not like to see 
themselves in a sort of Moklin 
mirror. So if they did that at all, 
they'd maybe keep it a secret, 
like children keep secrets from 
grownups. 

Moklins are a lot like kids. You 
can't help liking thefn. "But a 



human can get plenty panicky if 
he thinks what would happen if 
Moklins get to passing for humans among humans, and want 
their kids to have top-grade 
brains, and top-grade talents, and 
so on . . . 

I sweat, sitting there. I can see 
the whole picture. Brooks is worrying about Moklins loose among 
humans, outsmarting them as 
their kids grow up, being the big 
politicians, the bosses, the planetary pioneers, the prettiest girls 
and the handsomest guys in the 
Galaxy — everything humans 
want to be themselves. Just 
thinking about it is enough to 
make any human feel like he's 
going nuts. But Brooks is also 
worrying about Inspector Caldwell, who is five foot three and 
red-headed and cute as a bug's 
ear and riding for a bad fall. 

They come back from the trip 
to the other trading post. Inspector Caldwell is baffled and 
mad. Brooks is sweating and 
scared. He slips me the signal 
and 1 wiggle my little finger back 
at him, just so I'll know he didn't 
get substituted for without Inspector Caldwell knowing it, and 
so he knows nothing happened to 
me while he was gone. They 
didn't see the Moklin that looks 
like Brooks. They didn't get a 
bit of information we didn't have 
before — which is just about none 
at all. 



IF YOU WAS A MOK LI M 



Things go on. Brooks and me 
are sweating it out until the Palmyra lets down out of the sky 
again, meanwhile praying for Inspector Caldwell to get her ears 
pinned back so proper steps can 
be taken, and every morning he 
crosses his fingers at me, and I 
wiggle my little finger back at 
him . . . And he watches over Inspector Caldwell tender. 

THE other trading post goes on 
placid. They sell their stuff 
at half the price we sell ours 
for. So, on Inspector Caldwell's orders, we cut ours again 
to half what they sell theirs for. 
So they sell theirs for half what 
we sell ours for, so we sell ours for 
half what they sell theirs for. And 
so on. Meanwhile we sweat. 

Three days before the Palmyra 
is due, our goods are marked at 
just exactly one per cent of what 
they was marked a month before, and the other trading post 
is selling them at half that. It 
looks like we are going to have to 
pay a bonus to Moklins to take 
goods away for us to compete 
with the other trading post. 

Otherwise, everything looks 
normal on the surface. Moklins 
hang around as usual, friendly 
and admiring. They'll hang 
around a couple days just to get 
a look at Inspector Caldwell, and 
they regard her respectful. 
Brooks looks grim. He is head 



over heels crazy about her now, 
and she knows it, and she rides 
him hard. She snaps at him, and 
he answers her patient and gentle 
— because he knows that when 
what he hopes is going to happen, she is going to need him to 
comfort her. She has about wiped 
out our stock, throwing bargain 
sales. Our shelves are almost bare. 
But the other trading post still 
has plenty of stock. 

"Mr. Brooks," says Inspector 
Caldwell, bitter, at breakfast, 
"we'll have to take most of the 
Palmyra's cargo to fill up our inventory." 

"Maybe," he says, tender, "and 
maybe not." 

"But we've got to drive that 
other post out of business!" she 
says, desperate. Then she breaks 
down. "This — this is my first independent assignment. I've got to 
handle it successfully!" 

He hesitates. But just then 
Deeth comes in. He beams 
friendly at Inspector Caldwell. 

"A compliment for you, 
ma'am. Three of them." 

She goggles at him. Brooks 
says, gentle, "It's all right. Deeth, 
show them in and get some presents." 

Inspector Caldwell splutters 
incredulous, "But — but — " 

"Don't be angry," says Brooks. 
"They mean it as a compliment 
It is, actually, you know." 

Three Moklin girls come in, 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE F I r T I O H* 



giggling. They are not bad-looking at all. They look as human 
as Deeth, but one of them has a 
long, droopy mustache like a ■ 
mate of the Palmyra — that's because, they hadn't ever seen a 
human woman before Inspector 
Caldwell come along. They sure 
have admired her, though! And 
Moklin kids get born fast. Very 
fast. 

They show her what they are 
holding so proud and happy in 
their arms. They have got three 
little Moklin kids, one apiece. 
And every one of them has red 
hair, just like Inspector Caldwell, 
and every one of them is a girl 
that is the spit and image of her. 
You would swear they are human 
babies, and you'd swear they are 
hers. But of course they ain't. 
They make kid noises and wave 
their little fists. 

Inspector Caldwell is just plain 
paralyzed. She stares at them, 
and goes red as fire and white as 
chalk, and she is speechless. So 
Brooks has to do the honors. He 
admires the kids extravagant, and 
the Moklin girls giggle, and take 
the compliment presents Deeth. 
brings in, and they go out happy. 

When the door closes, Inspector Caldwell wilts. 

"Oh-h!" she wails. "It's true! 
You didn't — you haven't — they 
can make their babies look like 
anybody they want!" 

Brooks puts his arms around 



her and she begins to cry against 
his shoulder. He pats her and 
says, "They've got a queer sort 
of evolution on Moklin, darling, 
Babies here inherit desired characteristics. Not acquired characteristics, but desired ones! And 
what could be more desirable 
than you?" 

I am blinking at them. He says 
to me, cold, "Will you kindly get 
the hell out of here and stay 
out?" 

I come to. I says, "Just one 
precaution." 

I wiggle my little finger. He 
crosses his fingers at me. 

"Then," I says, "since there's 
no chance of a mistake, I'll leave 
you two together." 

And I do. 

PTlHE Palmyra booms down out 
of the sky two days later. 
We are all packed up. Inspector 
Caldwell is shaky, on the porch, 
of the post, when Moklins come 
hollering and waving friendly 
over from the landing field pulling a freight-truck with Cap 
Haney on it. I see other festive 
groups around members of the 
crew that — this being a scheduled 
stop — have been given ship-leave 
for a couple hours to visit their 
Moklin friends. 

"I've got the usual cargo — ** 
begins Cap Haney. 

"Don't discharge it," says Inspector Caldwell, firm. "We are 



IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN 



103 



abandoning this post. 1 have authority and Mr. Brooks has convinced me of the necessity for it. 
Please get our baggage to the 
ship." 

He gapes at her. "The Company don't like to give in to 
competition — " 

"There isn't any competition," 
says Inspector Caldwell. She 
gulps. "Darling, you tell him," 
she says to Brooks. 

He says, lucid, "She's right, 
Captain. The other trading post 
is purely a Moklin enterprise. 
They like to do everything that 
humans do. Since humans were 
running a trading post, they 
opened one too. They bought 
goods from us and pretended to 
sell them at half price, and we 
cut our prices, and they bought 
more goods from us and pretended to sell at half the new 
prices. . . . Some Moklin or other 
must've thought it would be nice 
to be a smart businessman, so his 
kids would be smart businessmen. Too smart ! We close up 
this post before Moklins think of 
other things . . 

He means, of course, that if 
Moklins get loose from their 
home planet and pass as humans, 
their kids can maybe take over 
human civilization. Human nature couldn't take that! But it is 
something to be passed on to the 
high brass, and not told around 
general. 



"Better sound the emergency 
recall signal," says Inspector 
Caldwell, brisk. 

We go over to the ship and the 
Palmyra lets go that wailing siren 
that'll carry twenty miles. Any 
crew member in hearing is going 
to beat it back to the ship fullspeed. They come running from 
every wh ich wa3*. « here they 
been visiting their Moklin friends. 
And then, all of a sudden, here 
comes a fellow wearing Moklin 
guest garments, yelling, 'Hey I 
Wait! I ain't got my clothec — " 

And then there is what you 
might call a dead silence. Because 
lined up for checkoff is another 
guy that comes running at the 
recall signal, and he is wearing 
ship's clothes, and you can see 
that him and the guy in Moklin 
guest garments are just exactly 
alike. Twins. Identical. The spit 
and image of each other. And it is 
for sure that one of them is a 
Moklin. But which? 

Cap Haney's eyes start to pop 
out of his head. But then the guy 
in Palmyra uniform grins and 
says, "Okay, I'm a Moklin. But 
us Moklins like humans so much, 
I thought it would be nice to 
make a trip to Earth and see 
more humans. My parents planned it five years ago, made me 
look like this wonderful human, 
and hid me for this moment But 
we would not want to make any 
difficulties for humans, so I have 



104 




 



confessed and I will leave the 

ship." 

He takes it as a joke on. him. 
He talks English as good as anybody. I don't know how anybody 
could tell which was the human 
guy and which one the Moklin, 
but this Moklin grins and steps 
down, and the other Moklins admire him enormous for passing 
even a few minutes as human 
among humans. 

We get away from there so 
fast, he is allowed to keep the 
human uniform.' 

MOKLIN is the first planet 
that humans ever get off of, 
moving fast, breathing hard, and 
sweating copious. It's one of 
those things that humans just 
can't take. Not that there's anything wrong with Moklins. 
They're swell folks. They like 
humans. But humans just can't 
take the idea of Moklins passing 
for human and being all the 
things humans want to be themselves. I think it's really a false 
alarm. I'll find out pretty soonInspector Caldwell and Brooks 
get married, and they go off to 
a post on Briarius Four — a swell 
place for a honeymoon if there 
ever was one — and I guess they 
are living happy ever after. Me, 
I go to the new job the Company assigns me — telling me stern 
not to talk about Moklin, which 
I don't — and the Space Patrol or


ders no human ship to land on 
Moklin for any reason. 

But I've been saving money 
and worrying. I keep thinking of 
those three Moklin kids that Inspector Caldwell knows she ain't 
the father of. I worry about those 
kids. I hope nothing's happened 
to them. Moklin kids grow up 
fast, like I told you. They'll be 
just about grown now. 

I'll tell you. I've bought me a 
little private spacecruiser, small 
but good. I'm shoving off for 
Moklin next week. If one of those 
three ain't married, I'm going to 
marry her, Moklin-style, and 
bring her out to a human colony 
planet. We'll have some kids. I 
know just what I want my kids 
to be like. They'll have plenty of 
brains — top-level brains — and the 
girls will be real good-looking! 

But besides that, I've got to 
bring some other Moklins out and 
start them passing for human, 
too. Because my kids are going 
to need other Moklins to marry, 
ain't they? It's not that I don't 
like humans. I do! If the fellow 
I look like — Joe Brinkley — hadn't 
got killed accidental on that 
hunting trip with Deeth, I never 
would have thought of taking his 
place and being Joe Brinkley. 
But you can't blame me for wanting to live among humans. 

Wouldn't you, if you was a 
Moklin ?

THE METEORIC STREAM 



By WILLY LEY 

Like cops, astronomers usually aren't 
around when big things happen— which 
may explain reports of Flying Saucers! 



THEV fell into the atmosphere like a swarm of angry missiles from the 
Moon. Just where they hit the 
atmosphere first is not known, 
but it must have been somewhere 
out over the Pacific Ocean. Then 
they were seen over Saskatche

wan, going east. They were, it 
was established later, some 35 
miles above sea level and they 
moved, as became apparent afterward, with that velocity which 
mathematicians and physicists 
call the "circular velocity." At 
that velocity, the degree of curva
AlAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



turc of a ballistic trajectory is the 
same as the degree of curvature 
of the Earth's surface, so that the 
altitude above sea level does not 
change. Expressed in figures the 
circular velocity is a little less 
than five miles per second. 

If it were to happen today, 
there would be frantic phone calls 
to newspapers and to police stations about a missile attack, or 
flying saucers. But the date was 
the 9th of February, 1913. 

It was seen from Saskatchan 
all the way across the Great 
Lakes to the Bermuda islands, 
and by ships out at sea beyond 
Bermuda. Unfortunately much of 
western New York State, Pennsylvania and Maryland happened 
to be covered by an unbroken 
overcast that evening. If the sky 
had been clear all along the path 
of the meteoric procession, it 
could have been seen by some 
thirty million people. Because of 
the overcast, only 141 observations could be put on record. All 
but six of them came from Canada and mostly from Ontario; one 
came from Michigan; one from 
New Jersey; two from Bermuda 
and two from ships at sea. 

rr^O the regret of all astronomers, not a member of the 
astronomical fraternity was a witness to the event. And only one of 
the witnesses used some optical 
aid: a high school boy in Trenton, 



N.J. had the good sense to run 
back into his room to get an 
opera glass. 

The cloudy layer and the absence of trained observers handicapped the investigation of the 
phenomenon a good deal. But by 
collecting diligently everything 
that could be learned, Professor 
C. A. Chant of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada did 
succeed in putting a rather complete picture together. As seen in 
western Ontario, this is what happened : 

At about 9:05 on the evening in question, there suddenly appeared in the 
northwestern sky a fiery red body 
which quickly grew larger as it came 
nearer, and which was then seen to be 
followed by a long tail. Some observers 
state that the body waa single, some 
that it was composed of two distinct 
parts, and others that there were three 
parts, all traveling together and each 
followed by a long tail. 

The front portion of the body appears 
to have been somewhat brighter than 
the rest, but the general color w; ] m 
fiery red or golden yellow. To some the 
tail seemed like the glare from the 
open door of a furnace; to othera it 
was like the illumination from a 
searchlight; to others like the stream of 
sparks blown away from a burning 
chimney by strong wind. 

Many of the observers said later that they thought at first that 
somebody had fired a large skyrocket, partly because of the color 
which reminded them of burning 
fireworks, partly because of the 



THE METEORIC STREAM 



107 



long tail, in which they believed 
they saw sparks. But a sky-rocket 
lasts for just so long and then 
falls, while this fie<ry red body 
did not. 

Before the astonishment aroused by 
this first meteor had subsided, other 
bodies were seen coming from the 
northwest, emerging irom precisely the 
same place as the first one. Onward 
they moved, at the same deliberate 
pace, in twos or threes or fours, with 
tails streaming behind, though not so 
long nor so bright as in the first case, 
They all traversed the same path and 
Were heading for the same point in 
the southeastern sky. Gradually the 
bodies became smaller, until the last 
ones were but red sparks, some ol 
which were snuffed out before they 
reached their destination. Several report that near the middle of the great 
procession was a fine large star without 
a tail, and that a similar body brought 
up the rear. 

To most observers the outstanding 
features of the phenomenon was the 
slow majestic motion of the bodies; 
and almost equally remarkable was the 
perfect formation which they retained. 
Many compared them to a fleet of airships, with lights on either side and 
forward and aft; but airmen will have 
to practice many years before they will 
be able to preserve such perfect 
order . . . 

While all witnesses agreed on 
the general picture, the date, the 
time and the direction of motion, 
there was considerable disagreement on the number of bodies* 
Most witnesses said "fifteen of 
twenty;" a number went higher, 
thinking that there must have 

10» 



been "between fifty and a hundred," while a few witnesses 
maintained that there had been 
"thousands." This, aside from the 
simple fact that some people have 
better eyes than others, depended 
on hoijj the counting was done. 

The very first body, for exam- i 
pie, could have been counted as 
three by some, while most would 
probably count it as one, even 
though it seemed to consist of 
several parts. The most reliable 
statement is probably that of the 
pupil of Trenton High School, 
Cecil Carley, who used an opera 
glass. He wrote : "There were 
about ten groups in all and each 
group, as seen through the opera glass, consisted of from 20 to 
40 meteors." 

While each observation was not 
very good — from the professional 
point of view — alt together contained enough pertinent information to calculate a number of figures. Some of them have already 
been mentioned. Over Canada, 
the meteorites were 35 miles high 
and moved with a velocity of 
about five miles per second. The 
distance between the various 
groups in the procession must 
have varied from a minimum of 
about 50 miles to a maximum of 
about 100 miles. The total length 
of the meteoric procession, therefore, was about 1,000 miles. 

For any single observer in Canada, the fantastic display lasted 


 



between three and four minutes. 
Whenever natural phenomena 
are reported by chance witnesses, 
the things they don't say are 
very often as important as the 
things they do report. 

It is important in this case, for 
example, that not a single observer reported that a meteorite 
dropped out of the procession and 
fell to the ground. Some thought 
sparks were falling from the tails, 
and that is probably correct. But 
the main bodies stayed in place. 
Nor did any one of the Canadian 
observers report that the groups 
of the procession shifted while 
he was watching. Everyone saw 
the groups maintain their distance from each other. The sequence of the groups also did not 
change: a large golden red body 
(or bodies) first, then a number 
of smaller ones of similar appearance, a bright tailless body, 
then again some others, and small 
red ones last. 

But while the procession traversed the cloud -covered eastern 
United States, a change did take 
place. The reports from Bermuda 
leave no doubt, as far as time of 
appearance and direction of 
travel were concerned, that the 
same meteoric procession was 
seen. But the description of the 
appearance differs markedly from 
the "Canadian reports. 

The large tailless body was 
now in the lead and was emit


ting sparks. The others followed 
after it and were apparently not 
quite as bright any more. 

There is, as we now know from 
high altitude rocket work, very 
little air resistance at a height 
of 35 miles. But over a distance 
such as the one from Toronto to 
Bermuda, even this slight air resistance must have made itself 
felt. The procession, traveling 
under kinetic energy only, had 
lost altitude. Professor Pickering 
calculated, from the Bermuda reports, that the procession was 
only about 30 miles above sea 
level when the islands were 
reached. / 

As regards the fact that the 
"fine tailless star," which had 
been in the middle of the procession when over Canada, was 
in the lead and sparking over 
Bermuda, Prof. Pickering arrived 
at an interesting conclusion. That 
tailless meteor, he said, was probably an iron meteorite, while all 
the others were either stony meteorites or so-called stony irons. An 
iron meteorite, having a higher 
specific gravity, has, of course, 
a greater kinetic energy than a 
body of lesser specific gravity 
traveling with the same velocity. 
Because of its higher kinetic energy, it had gradually forged 
ahead and assumed the lead. 

The ships out at sea were not 
far enough beyond Bermuda for 
thei^ crews to see a further step 



THE METEORIC STREAM 



in the history of the meteoric procession. If there had been a ship 
a thousand miles or so southeast 
of Bermuda — say on a line drawn 
from Bermuda to St. Helena — it 
might have reported a still lower 
altitude, and, in all probability, 
a longer interval between the 
tailless meteor and the other 
groups which followed. It was almost certain that the procession 
fell into the Atlantic Ocean before reaching the African coast. 

That night was a night of large 
meteors. Three bright fireballs 
and one group were reported a 
few hours later, going west. A 
single bright fireball had been 
seen 45 minutes before the procession began, traveling in the 
same direction. And after the procession there was one going east. 

From all this, Prof. Pickering 
concluded that during that night 
our planet had overtaken a swarm 
of relatively large meteorites, 
which traveled roughly along the 
orbit of Earth and with about 
the same velocity, relative to the 
Sun. The point is that the swarm 
extended over an area somewhat 
bigger than the diameter of 
Earth. Because of that, some 
were caught on one side of the 
planet and some on the other. 
The result, seen from the ground, 
was, of course, meteors going in 
opposite directions. 

As is customary after a strange 
phenomenon, a number of re


searchers invaded the libraries 
looking for similar events in the 
past. There were plenty of bright 
fireballs going east or going west. 
There were bright fireballs with 
long tails and bright fireballs 
without tails. There were fireballs 
which fead disappeared below the 
horizon, and there were fireballs 
which had exploded in full view 
of the witnesses. Sometimes even 
pieces had been salvaged. But the 
researchers had to go back ten 
centuries to find another actual 
procession. It was seen in the vicinity of Cairo in 1029 A. D., 
only nobody had bothered then 
to write down details. The source 
merely said that "in the month of 
Redjeb (August) many stars 
passed, with a great noise and 
a brilliant light." 

That does not mean, naturally, 
that another thousand years will 
go by until another meteoric procession occurs. It may happen 
next year, or next month, or tomorrow. But one almost wishes 
that there will be an overcast 
again, with only astronomical observatories sticking out through 
the cloud layer. Because now, 
with world tension as high as it 
is, nine out of ten observers would 
interpret such a procession as a 
military attack. 

It would be like throwing a 
rock into a nest" of hornets — a 
cosmic joke on blind-angry humanity. ' — WILLY LEY

|^ALLIDITY? Callidity! This

of those many Easy Steps to 
Supermanhood that A. E. v. V. 
has delighted in supermanhandling during his writing career. 
Remember Null- A? The Totipotent Being? The radioactive 
Lord Clane? The Nexialist? And 
of course Slan? There must be 
more, but I've forgotten 'em. 

The Sooper-Hooper-Dooperman in the present opus has a 
kind of magic power called by the 



word which- opens this faintly disrespectful review — ■ a word which 
according to my Unabridged 
Webster ('tisn't in the Collegiate 
W. at all) means cunning, or 
craftiness. 

Herr Professor van Vogt shifts 
its molecular structure to make it 
■mean "unbeatable luck" or "abbility to influence elements of 
chance in one's favor." A foolproof gambler would be '"callid," 
says 1 V. V. And callid Cayle 
Clarke, the book's leading (but 
not only) superman, ends up being a foolproof stock-market rigger and financier.

sibly terrific supermen in starting 
a review of this wholly absorbing 
story. 

No doubt about it, van Vogt 
is one of the masters of the Effective Grandiose in modern 
fiction. Furthermore, the plan of 
the book is essentially intriguing. 
It is assumed that any society 
that wants to remain both stable 
and yet advancing must have 
both a practically permanent 
government and an equally permanent, built-in, operating "safety -valve" opposition. 

In the present instance we have 
Isher, an empire some X,000 years 
from now, ruled by a fairly unlikely 28-year-old queen. It is an 
absolute monarchy, more or less. 

The weapons shops, on the 
other hand, with all the super 
science your little heart could 
wish for — matter transmitters, 
invisibility machines, time travel 
gadgets and what not — exist 
simply to provide the individual 
citi/cn of Isher with an individual defense against encroachments on his individual rights by 
the state. This it does by providing them, on demand, with individual and invincible "energy 
weapons" which will shoot only 
when they are being used in selfdefense. Inanimate objects with 
electronic consciences, eh? 

You all remember, I am sure, 
that fine old unrepeatable talc, 
the tag line of which, shrilled out 



in a high piping voice, is: "Hold 
onto your hats, boys, here we go 
again!" That's the way I always 
feel about a van Vogt story. A 
wonderful rollercoaster thrill. 

DRAGONS ISLAND, by Jack 
Williamson. Simon & Schuetpr, 
New York, 1951. 246 pages, $2.50 

HpHIS new Williamson is a long 
■■- way from the enormous conception that was The Humanoids, 
and its basic idea, the creation 
of supermen not too different 
from those in Olaf Stapledon's 
Odd John, is not what you'd call 
original. It is sometimes powerful 
and often ingenious, but generally too reminiscent. 

Through genetic engineering. 
so-called, mysterious Scientist 
Charles Kendrew is supposed to 
have created a number of "NotMen" or "Homo Perfectans." 

The existence of these supermen becomes known to a few 
homo saps, who organize a small 
ruthless band dedicated to their 
destruction. Along comes Hero 
Dane Belfast, son of one of old 
Kendrew's close associates and 
both the homo-sap opponents and 
the Beautiful Not -girl try to get

tures will be allowed to breed and 
ultimately eliminate us poor inferiors. 

There is some impressively real 
atmosphere, particularly in the 
jungles and hidden laboratories 
on New Guinea (the "Dragon's 
Island" of the title), and a goodly 
number of satisfactory mystifications, curiosities, and superactions, of the sort Jack Williamson is adept at producing. 

TWO NOVELS, by I. Ron Hubbard. Gnome Press, Inc., New 
York, 1951. 256 pages, $2.75. 

"T^HE two Novels are Typewrit' 
■■■ er in the Sky and Fear. Neither of them is science fiction, 
despite the jacket claim — they 
are weirds or "fantasies" — and 
both are promoted on the jacket 
as being by "L. Ron Hubbard, 
the Founder of Dianetics," which, 
come to thinl; it, is reason for 
publishing other Hubbard fiction. 

Typewriter in the Sky is a silly 
idea inexpertly carried out. It 
assumes that a modern man is 
physically translated to the Sixteen Hundreds to become a Spanish admiral — unwilling villain of 
a novel a friend is writing. 

Outside of a lot of extremely 
ordinary costume drammer and 
strictly pulp romance, the. tale is 
devoted to the struggle between 
"the typewriter in the sky," 
which makes the modern charac


ter in his "displaced personage** 
do the commercial heroisms the 
author wants him to do. 

Fear, on the other hand, and 
despite its screwy modus operandi turns out to be a totally unexpected masterpiece of horror. 

The hero is a professor who 
has published an article in which 
he claims there are no demons. 
Well, it turns out there ar,e, says 
Hubbard and they get the hell 
after Professor Lowry, with, as 
the ancient saying goes, bells on. 
From there on in, it is definitely 
no kidding. 

What we have here, it seems to 
me, is a pyrotechnically brilliant 
record of the effects of an uncontrollable phobia on a relativly imaginative and perceptive individual. 

The whole novella is a shattering kaleidoscope of auditory, visual, tactile and, even worse, mental and emotional horrors, awfulnesses, hysterias, frustrations, 
stinks and shuddering screams, 
all of which lead up to a totally 
unexpected — and yet inevitable 
— climax, which is all real and a 
yard wide (nothing supernatural 
about that ending!) and as horrible as any of the psychological 
terrors that have preceded it. 

A completely engrossing tale. 
You will be moved and astonished by what Hubbard has 
achieved in it.

perhaps Hie weirdest encounter of alien races! 



Nlusfrated by 1H0RNE 

THE^cabin boy's name was 
unspeakable, and even its 
meaning would be difficult 
to convey in any human tongue. 
For convenience, we may as well 
call him Tommy Loy. 

Please bear in mind that* all 
these terms are approximations. 
Tommy was not exactly a cabin 
boy, and even the spaceship he 
served was not exactly a spaceship, nor was the Captain exactly 



a captain. But if you think of 
Tommy as a freckled, scowling, 
red-haired, willful, prank-playing, 
thoroughly abhorrent brat, and of 
the Captain as a crusty, ponderous old man, you may be able to 
understand their relationship. 

A word about Tommy will 
serve to explain why these approximations have to be made, 
and just how much they mean.' 
Tommy, to a human being, would 




 



have looked like a six-foot egg 
made of greenish gelatin. Suspended in this were certain dark 
or radiant shapes which were 
Tommy's nerve centers and digestive organs,, and scattered about 
its surface were star-shaped and 
oval markings which were his sensory organs and gripping. mechanisms — his "hands." At the lesser 
end was an orifice which expelled 



a stream of glowing vapor, Tom* 
my's means of propulsion. It 
should be clear that if instead of 
saying, "Tommy ate his lunch," 
or, "Tommy said to the Captain—" we reported what really 
happened, some pretty complicated explanations would have to 
be made. 'f , . 

Similarly, the term "cabin boy** 
is used because it is the closest 



CABIN BOY 



111 



in human meaning. Some vocations, like seafaring, are so demanding and so complex that 
they simply cannot be taught in 
classrooms; they have to be lived. 
A cabin boy is one who is learning such a vocation and paying 
for his instruction by performing 
certain menial, degrading, and 
unimportant tasks. 

That certainly describes Tommy, with one more similarity — 
the cabin boy of the sailing vessel was traditionally occupied 
after each whipping with preparing the mischief, or the stupidity, 
that earned him the next one. 

Tommy, at the moment, had 
e whipping coming to him, and 
was fighting a delaying action. He 
knew he couldn't escape eventual 
punishment, but he planned, with 
a wholehearted determination, to 
hold it off as long as he could. 

Floating alertly in one of the 
innumerable corridors of the ship, 
he watched as a dark wave sprang 
into being upon the glowing corridor wall and sped toward him. 
Instantly, Tommy was moving 
away from it, and at the same 
rate of speed. 

The wave rumbled: "Tommy! 
Tommy Loy ! Where is that obscenity boy?" 

The wave moved on, rumbling 
wordlessly, and Tommy moved 
with it. Ahead of him was another 
wave, and another beyond that, 
and it was the same throughput 



all the corridors of the ship. 
Abruptly the waves reversed their 
direction. So did Tommy,* barely 
in time. The waves not only carried the Captain's orders, but 
scanned every corridor and com' 
partment of the ten-mile ship. 
But as long as Tommy kept be- i 
tween the waves, the Captain 
could not see him. 

It did not strike Tommy as odd 
that the Captain never thought * 
of keeping the scanning waves 
stationary and letting the search 
parties catch up to him. The Captain, like all the rest of the crew, 
was not very bright in comparison with Tommy. This was odd 
enough, but Tommy had long 
since given up trying to puzzle 
out the reason. It was part of his 
universe. 

The trouble was that he could 
not keep this up forever, and he 
was being searched for by other 
lowly members of the crew. It 
took a long time to traverse each 
of those' winding, interlaced passages, but it was a mathematical 
certainty that he would be caught 
eventually. 

Tommy shuddered, and at the 
same time he squirmed with delight. He had interrupted the Old 
Man's sleep by a stench- of a particularly noisome variety, one. of 
which he had only lately found 
himself capable. The effect had 
been beautiful. In human terms, 
since Tommy's race communi


ng 




 



cated by odors, it was equivalent 
to setting off a firecracker beside 
a sleeper's ear. 

Judging by the jerkiness of the 
scanning waves' motion, the Old 
Man was still unnerved. 

"Tommy!" the waves rumbled. 
"Come out, you little piece of 
filth, or I'll smash you into a 
thousand separate stinks ! By 
Spore, when I get hold of you — " 

The corridor intersected another at this point, and Tommy 
seized his chance to duck into the 
new one. He had been working 
his way outward ever since his 
crime, knowing that the search 
parties would do the same. When 
he reached the outermost level of 
the ship, there would be a slight 
possibility of slipping back past 
the hunters — not much of a 
chance, but better than none. 

He kept close to the wall. He 
was the smallest member of the 
crew — smaller than any of the 
Other cabin boys, and less than 
half the size of an Ordinary; it 
was always possible that when he 
sighted one of the search party, 
he could get away before the 
crewman saw him. He was in a 
short connecting corridor now, 
but the scanning waves cycled 
endlessly, always turning back 
before he could escape into the 
next corridor. Tommy followed 
their movement patiently, while 
he listened to the torrent of abuse 
that poured from them. He snick


ered fragrantly to himself. When 
the Old Man was angry, everybody suffered. The ship would 
be stinking from stem to stern by 
now. 

pWENTUALLY the Captain 
forgot himself and the waves 
flowed on around the next intersection. Tommy moved on. He 
was getting close to his goal by 
now; he could see a faint gleam 
of starshine up at the end of the 
corridor. 

The next turn took him into 
it — and what Tommy saw 
through the semi-transparent skin 
of the ship nearly made him falter and get caught. Not merely 
the fiery pinpoints of stars shone 
there, but a great, furious glow 
which could only mean that they 
were passing through a star system. It was the first time this had 
happened in Tommy's life, but 
of course it was nothing to the 
Captain, or even to most of the 
Ordinaries. Trust them, Tommy 
thought resentfully, to say nothing to him about it! 

Now he knew he was glad he'd 
tossed that surprise at the Captain. If he hadn't, he wouldn't be 
here, and if he weren't here — 

A waste capsule was bumping 
automatically along the corridor, 
heading for one of the exit pores 
in the hull. Tommy let it catch 
up to him. then englobed it, but 
it stretched him so tight that he 



CABIN BOY 



119 



could barely hold it. That was all 
to the good; the Captain wouldn't 
be likely to notice that anything 
had happened. 

The hull was sealed, not to keep 
atmosphere inside, for there was 
none except by accident, but to 
prevent loss of liquid by evaporation. Metals and other mineral 
elements were replaceable: liquids 
and their constituents, in ordinary 
circumstances, were not. 

Tommy rode the capsule to the 
exit sphincter, squeezed through, 
and instantly released it. Being 
polarized away from the ship's 
core, it shot into space and was 
lost. Tommy hugged the outer 
surface of the hull, and gazed at 
the astonishing panorama that 
surrounded him. 

There was the enormous black 
half-globe of space — Tommy's 
sky. the only one he had ever 
known. It was sprinkled with the 
familiar yet always changing patterns of the stars. By themselves, 
these were marvels enough for a 
child whose normal universe was 
one of ninety-foot corridors and 
chambers measuring, at most, 
three times as much. But Tommy 
hardly noticed them. Down to his 
right, reflecting brilliantly from 
the long, gentle curve of the 
greenish hull, was a blazing yellow-white glory that he could 
hardly look at. A star, the first 
one he had ever seen close at 
band. Off to the left was a tiny, 



milky -blue disk that could only 
be a planet. 

Tommy let go a shout, for the 
sheer pleasure of its thin, hollow 
sound, or, if you prefer, smell. 
He watched the thin mist of particles spread lazily away from his 
body, faintly luminous against 
the jet blackness. He shivered a 
little, thickening his skin as much 
as he could. He could not stay 
long, he knew; he was radiating 
heat faster than he could absorb 
it from the sun on the ship's hull. 

But he didn't want to go back 
inside, and not only because it 
meant bt-ing caught and punished. 
He didn't want to leave that 
great, dazzling jewel in the sky. 
For an instant he thought vaguely 
of the future time when he would 
be grown, the master of his own 
vessel, and could see the stars 
whenever he chose; but the picture was too far away to have 
any reality. Great Spore, that 
wouldn't happen for twenty thousand years! 

Fifty yards away, an enormous 
dark spot on the hull, one of the 
ship's vision devices, swelled and 
darkened. Tommy looked up with 
interest. He could see nothing in 
that direction, but evidently the 
Captain had spotted something. 
Tommy watched and waited, 
growing colder every second, and 
after a long time he saw a new 
pinpoint of light spring into being. 
It grew steadily larger, turned 



III 




 



fuzzy at one side, then became 
two linked dots, one hard and 
bright, the other misty. 

Tommy looked down with sudden understanding, and saw that 
another wide area of the ship's 
hull was swollen and protruding. 
This one showed a pale color under the green and had a dark ring 
around it: it was a polarizer. The 
object he had seen must contain 
metal, and the Captain was bringing it in for fuel. Tommy hoped 
it was a big one; they had been 
short of metal ever since he could 
remember. 

When he glanced up again, the 
object was much larger. He could 
see now that the bright part was 
hard and smooth, reflecting the 
light of the nearby sun. The misty 
part was a puzzler. It looked like 
a crewman's voice, seen against 
space — or the ion trail of a ship 
in motion. But_was it possible for 
metal to be alive? 

T EO ROGET stared into the 
rear-view scanner and wiped 
beads of sweat from his brown, 
half -bald scalp. Flaming gas from 
the jets washed up toward him 
along the hull; he couldn't see 
much. But the huge dark void 
they were headed for was still 
there, and it was getting bigger. 
He glanced futilely at the 'control 
board. The throttle was on full. 



They were going to crash In a little more than two minutes, and 
there didn't seem to be a single 
thing he could do about it. 

He looked at Frances McMenamin, strapped into the acceleration harness .beside his own. She 
said, "Try cutting off the jets, 
why don't you?" 

Roget was a short, muscular 
man with not very much straight 
black hair and sharp brown eyes. 
McMenamin was slender and 
ash-blonde, half an inch taller 
than he was. with one of those 
pale, exquisitely shaped faces that 
seem to be distributed equally 
among the very stupid and the 
very bright. Roget had never been 
perfectly sure which she was, although they had been companions 
for more than three years. That, 
in a way, was part of the reason 
they had taken this pretty wild 
trip: she had made Roget uneasy, 
and he wanted to break away, 
and at the same time he didn't. 
So he had fallen in with her idea 
of a trip to Mars — "to get off by 
ourselves and think" — and here, 
Roget thought, they were, not 
thinking particularly. 

He said, "You want us to crash 
quicker?" 

"How do you know we will?"* 
she countered. "It's the only thing 
we haven't tried. Anyhow, we'd 
be able to see where we're going, 
and that's more than we can do 
now." 



C A I I N BOY 



II* 



"All right," said Roget, "all 
right." She was perfectly capable 
of giving him six more reasons, 
each screwier than the last, and 
then turning out to be justified. 
He pulled the throttle back to 
zero, and the half-heard, half-felt 
roar of the jets died. 

The ship jerked backward suddenly, yanking them against the 
couch straps, and then slowed. 

Roget looked into the scanner 
again. They were approaching the 
huge object, whatever it was, at 
about the same rate as before. 
Maybe, he admitted unwillingly, 
a little slower. Damn the woman! 
How could she possibly have figured that one out in advance? 

"And," McMenarnin added 
reasonably, "we'll save fuel for 
the takeoff." 

Roget scowled at her. "If there 
is a takeoff," he said. "Whatever 
is pulling us down there isn't doing it to show off. What do we 
do — tell them that was a very 
impressive trick and we enjoyed 
it, but we've' got to be leaving 
now?" 

"We'll find out what's doing 
it," said McMenarnin, "and stop 
it if we can. If we can't, the fuel 
won't do us any good anyway." 

That was, if not Frances' most 
exasperating trick, at least high 
on the list. She had a habit of 
introducing your own argument 
as if it were not only a telling 
point on her side, but something 



you had been "too dense to see. 
Arguing with her was like swinging at someone who abruptly disappeared and then sandbagged 
you from behind. 

Roget was fuming, but he said 
nothing. The greenish surface below was approaching more and 
more slowly, and now he felt a 
slight but definite tightening of 
the couch straps that could only 
mean deceleration. They were 
being maneuvered in for a landing as carefully and efficiently as 
if they were doing it themselves. 

A few seconds later, a green 
horizon line appeared in the directview ports, and they touched. 
Roget's and McMenaniin's couches swung on their gimbals as the 
ship tilted slowly, . bounced and 
came to rest. 

Frances reached inside the wide 
collar of her pressure suit to 
smooth a ruffle that had got 
crumpled between the volcanic 
swell of her bosom and the front 
of the transparent suit. Watching 
her, Roget felt a sudden irrational 
flow of affection and — as usually 
happened — a simultaneous notification that his body disagreed 
with his mind's opinion of her. 
She was nuts, but he couldn't do 
without her. This trip, it had been 
tacitly agreed, was to be a kind 
of final trial period. At the end of 
it, either they would split up or 
decide to make it permanent, and 
up to now, Roget had been si


120 




 



lently determined that it was going to be a split. Now he was just 
as sure that, providing they ever 
got to Mars or back to Earth, he 
was going to nail her for good. 

He glanced at her face. She 
knew, all right, just as she'd 
known when he'd felt the other 
way. It should have irritated him, 
but he felt oddly pleased and 
comforted. He unstrapped himself, fastened down his helmet, 
and moved toward the airlock. 

"Be careful," she said. 

"Yeah." He looked at her. "Be 
back in a minute." 

She smiled — not a big one, for 
show, but the little, quiet kind 
that lit up her face. Roget grinned 
back and closed the airlock door 
behind him. 

He stood on a pale -green, almost featureless surface that 
curved gently away in every direction. Where he stood, it was 
brilliantly lit by the sun, and his 
shadow was sharp and as black 
as space. About two-thirds of the 
way to the horizon, looking across 
the short axis of the ship, the 
sunlight stopped with knife-edge 
sharpness, and he could make out 
the rest only as a ghostly reflection of starlight. 

Their ship was lying on its side, 
with the pointed stern apparently 
sunk a few inches into the green 
surface of the alien ship. He took 
a cautious step in that direction, 
and nearly floated past it before 



he could catch himself. His boot 
magnets had failed to grip. The 
metal of this hull — if it was metal 
— must be something that contained no steel. 

The green hull was shot 
through with other colors here, 
and it rose in a curious, almost 
rectangular mound. At the center, 
just at the tip of the Earth vessel's jets, there was a pale area; 
around that was a dark ring 
which lapped up over the side of 
the ship. He bent to examine it. 
It was in shadow, and he used his 
helmet light. 

The light shone through the 
mottled green substance; he could 
see the skin of his own ship. It 
was pitted, corroding. As he 
watched, another pinpoint of corruption appeared on the shiny 
surface, and slowly grew. 

Roget straightened up with an 
exclamation. His helmet phones 
asked, "What is it, Leo?" 

He said, "Acid or something 
eating the hull. Wait a minute." 
He looked again at the pale and 
dark mottlings under the green 
surface. The center area was not 
attacking the ship's metal; that 
might be the muzzle of whatever 
instrument had been used to pull 
them down' out of their orbit and 
hold them there. But if it waS

the ship away from the dark ring 
that was destroying it. He 
couldn't fire the jets otherwise,

because they were half -buried ; 
he'd blow the tubes if he tried. 

He said, "You still strapped 
in?" 

"Yes." 

"All right, hold on." He stepped 
back to the center of the little 
ship, braced his corrugated boot 
soles against the hard green surface, and shoved. 

The ship rolled. But it rolled 
like a top, around the axis of its 
pointed end. The dark area gave 
way before it, as if it were jellysoft. The jets still pointed to the 
middle of the pale area, and the 
dark ring still lapped over them. 
Roget moved farther down and 
tried again, with the same result. 
The ship would move freely in 
every direction but the right one. 
The attracting power, clearly 
enough, was still on. 

IIF, straightened dejectedly and 
looked around. A few hundred yards away, he saw something he had noticed before, without attaching any significance to 
it: a six-foot egg, of some lighter, 
more translucent substance than 
the one on which it lay. He 
leaped toward it. It moved sluggishly away, trailing a cloud of 
luminous gas. A few seconds later 
he had it between his gloved 
bands. It squirmed, then ejected 
tt thin spurt of vapor from its 
forward end. It was alive. 

McMenamin's head was sil


houetted in one of the forward 
ports. He said, "See this?" 

"Yes! What is it?" 

"One of the crew, I think. I'm 
going to bring it in. You work the 
airlock — it won't hold both of us 
at once." 

"... All right." 

The huge egg crowded the 
cabin uncomfortably. It was 
pressed up against the rear wall, 
where it had rolled as soon as 
Frances had pulled it into the 
ship. The two humans stood at 
the other side of the room, against 
the control panel, and watched 
it. 

"No features," said Roget, "unless you count those markings .on 
the surface. This thing isn't from 
anywhere in the Solar System, 
Frances— it isn't even any order 
of evolution we ever heard of." 

"I know," she said abstractedly. 
"Leo, is he wearing any protection against space that you can 
see?" 

"No," said Roget. "That's him, 
not a spacesuit. Look, you can see 
halfway into him. But — " 

Frances turned to look at him. 
"That's it," she said. "It means 
this is his natural element — 
space!" 

Roget looked thoughtfully at 
the egg. "It makes sense," he 
said. "He's adapted for it. anyhow — ovoid, for a high volumeto-surface ratio. Tough outer 
shell. Moves by jet propulsion.

It's hard to believe, because we've 
never run into a creature like him 
before, but I don't see why not. 
On Earth there are organisms, 
plants, that can live and reproduce in boiling water, and others 
that can stand near-zero temperatures." 

"He's a plant, too, you know," 
Frances put in. 

Roget stared at her, then back 
at the egg. "That color, you 
mean? Chlorophyl. It could be." 

"Must be," she corrected firmly. 
"How else would he live in a 
vacuum?" And then, distressedly, 
"Oh, what a smell!" 

They looked at each other. It 
had been something monumental 
in the way of smells, though it 
had only lasted a fraction of a 
second. There had been a series 
of separate odors, all unfamiliar 
and all overpoweringly strong. At 
least a dozen of them, Roget 
thought; they had gone past too 
quickly to count. 

"He did it before, outside, and 
I saw the vapor." He closed his 
helrnet abruptly and motioned 
McMenamin to do the same. She 
frowned and shook her head. He 
opened his helmet again. "It 
might be poisonous!" 

"I don't think so," said McMenamin. "Anyway, we've got to 
try something." She walked toward the green egg. It rolled away 
from | her, and she went "past it 
into the bedroom. 



In a minute she reappeared, 
carrying an armload of plastic 
boxes and bottles. She came back 
to Roget and knelt on the floor, 
lining up the containers with their 
nipples toward the egg. 

"What's this for?" Roget demanded. "Listen, we've got to figure some way of getting out of 
here. The ship's being eaten up — '* 

"Wait," said McMenamin. She 
reached down and squeezed three 
of the nipples quickly, one after 
the other. There was a tiny spray 
of face powder, then one of cologne (Nuit Juvienne), followed 
by a jet of good Scotch. 

Then she waited.. Roget was 
about to open his mouth when 
another blast of unfamiliar odors 
came from the egg. This time 
there were only three: two sweet 
ones and one sharp. 

■jlTcMENAMIN smiled. "I'm 
1TX going to name him Stinky," 
she said. She pressed the nipple* 
again, in a different order. Scotch, 
face powder, Nuit Juvienne. The 
egg replied: sharp, sweet, sweet. 

She gave him the remaining 
combination, and he echoed it; 
then she put a record cylinder on 
the floor and squirted the face 
powder. She added another cylinder and squeezed the cologne. She 
went along the line that way, releasing a smell for each cylinder 
until there were ten. The egg had 
responded, recognizably in some 



CABIN BOY 



Hi 



TP" 



cases, to each one. Then she took 
away seven of the cylinders and 
looked expectantly at the egg. 

The egg released a sharp odor. 

*'If ever we tell anybody," said 
Roge-t in an awed tone, "that you 
taught a six-foot Easter egg to 
count to ten by selected flatulence — " 

"Hush, fool," she said. "This is 
a tough one." 

She lined up three cylinders, 
waited for the sharp odor, then 
added six more to make three 
rows of three. The egg obliged 
with a penetrating smell which 
was a good imitation of citron 
extract, Frances* number nine. He 
followed it immediately with another of his own rapid, complicated series of smells. 

"He gets it," said McMenamin. 
"I think he just told us that three 
times three are nine." She stood 
up. "You go out first, Leo. I'll 
put htm out after you and then 
follow. There's something more 
we've got to show him before we 
let him go." 

Roget followed orders. When 
the egg came out and kept on 
going, he stepped in its path and 
held it back. Then he moved 
away, hoping the thing would 
get the idea that they weren't 
trying to force it, but wanted it 
to stay. The egg wobbled indecisively for a moment, and then 
stayed where it was. Frances came 



out the next minute, carrying one 
of the plastic boxes and a portable 
flashlight. 

"My nicest powder," she said 
regretfully, "but it was the only 
thing I could find enough of." 
She clapped her gloved hands together sharply, with the box between them. It burst, and a haze 
of particles spread around them, 
glowing faintly in the sunlight. 

The egg was still waiting, somehow giving the impression that it 
was watching them alertly. McMenamin flicked on the flashlight 
and pointed it at Roget. It made 
a clear, narrow path in the haze 
of dispersed particles. Then she 
turned it on herself, on the ship, 
and finally upward, toward the 
tiny blue disk that was Earth. 
She did it twice more, then stepped back toward the airlock, and 
Roget followed her. 

They stood watching as Tommy scurried off across the hull, 
squeezed himself into it and disappeared. 

*'That was impressive," Roget 
said. "But I wonder just how 
much good it's going to do us." ' 

"He knows we're alive, intelligent, friendly, and that we come 
from Earth," said McMenamin 
thoughtfully. "Or, anyhow, we 

did our best to tell him. That's 
all we can do. Maybe he won't 
want to help us; maybe he can't. 
But it's up to him now." 



ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in 

HpHE mental state of Tommy, 
as he dived through the hull 
of the ship and into the nearest 
radial corridor, would be difficult to describe fully to any human being. He was the equivalent 
of a very small boy — that approximation still holds good — and 
he had the obvious reactions to 
novelty and adventure. But there 
was a good deal more. He had 
seen living, intelligent beings of 
an unfamiliar shape and substance, who lived in metal and 
had some connection with one of 
those enormous, enigmatic ships 
called planets, which no captain 
of his own race dared approach. 

And yet Tommy knew, with all 
the weight of knowledge accumulated, codified and transmitted 
over a span measured in billions 
of years, that there was no other 
intelligent race than his own in 
the entire universe, that metal, 
though life-giving, could not itself be alive, and that no living 
creature, having the ill luck to be 
spawned aboard a planet, could 
ever hope to escape so tremendous 
a gravitational field. 

The final result of all this was 
that Tommy desperately wanted 
to go somewhere by himself and 
think. But he couldn't; he had to 
keep moving, i n time with the 
scanning waves along the corridor, and he had to give ell his 



mental energy to the problem of 
slipping past the search party. 

The question was — how long 
had he been gone? If they had 
reached the hull while he was inside the metal thing, they might 
have looked for him outside and 
concluded that he had somehow 
slipped past them, back to the 
center of the ship. In that case, 
they would probably be working 
their way back, and he had only 
to follow them to the axis and 
hide in a chamber as soon as they 
left it. But if they were still working outward, his chances of escape 
were almost nil. And now it 
seemed more important to escape 
than it had before. 

There was one possibility which 
Tommy, who, in most circumstances, would try anything, 
hated to think about. Fuel lines 
— tubes carrying the rushing, radiant ion vapor that powered the 
ship — adjoined many of these 
corridors, and it was certain that 
if he dared to enter one, he would 
be perfectly safe from detection 
as long as he remained in it. But, 
for one thing, these lines radiated 
from the ship's axis and none of 
them would take him where he 
wanted to go. For another, they 
were the most dangerous place 
aboard ship. Older crew members 
sometimes entered them to make 
emergency repairs, but they got 
out as quickly as they could. 
Tommy did not know how long 



CABIN BOY 



125 



he could survive there; he had an 
unpleasant conviction that it 
would not be long. 

Only a few yards up the corridor was the sealed sphincter 
which gave entrance to such a 
tube. Tommy looked at it indecisively as the motion of the 
scanning waves brought him nearer. He had still not made up his 
mind when he caught a flicker 
reflected around the curve of the 
corridor behind him. 

Tommy squeezed himself closer 
to the wall and watched the other 
end of the corridor approach with 
agonizing slowness. If he could 
only get around that corner — 

The flicker of motion was repeated, and then he saw a thin 
rind of green poke into view. 
There was no more time to consider entering the fuel line, no 
time to let the scanning waves' 
movement carry him around the 
corner. Tommy put on full speed, 
cutting across the next wave and 
down the cross -corridor ahead. 

Instantly the Captain's voice 
shouted from the wall : "Ah! Was 
that him, the dirty scut? After 
him, lads!"" 

Tommy glanced behind as he 
turned another corner, and his 
heart sank. It was no cabin boy 
who was behind him, or even an 
Ordinary, but a Third Mate — so 
huge that he filled nearly half the 
width of the corridor, and so powerful that Tommy, in comparison. 



was like a boy on a bicycle racing 
an express train. 

He turned another corner, realizing in that instant that he was 
as good as caught : the new corridor ahead of him stretched 
straight and without a break for 
three hundred yards. As he 
flashed down it, the hulk of the 
Mate appeared around the bend 
behind. The Captain's voice bellowed, "Get the little essence of 
putrescence !" 

The Mate was coming up with 
terrifying speed, and Tommy had 
time for only one last desperate 
spurt. Then the other body slammed with stunning force against 
his, and he was held fast. 

As they coasted to a halt, the 
Captain's voice rumbled from the 
wall; "That's it, Mister. Hold him 
where I can see him!" 

The scanning areas were stationary now. The Mate moved 
Tommy forward until he was 
squarely in range of the nearest. 

Tommy squirmed futilely. The 
Captain said, "There's our little 
jokester. It's a pure pleasure to 
see you again, Tommy. What — 
no witty remarks? Your humor 
all dried up?" 

Tommy gasped, "Hope you enjoyed your nap, Captain." 

'Very good," said the Captain 
with heavy sarcasm. "Oh, very 
entertaining, Tommy. Now would 
you have anything more to say, 

before I put the whips to you?" 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Tommy was silent. 

The Captain said to the Mate, 
"Nice work, Mister. You'll get 
extra rations for this." 

The Mate spoke for the first 
time, and Tommy recognized his 
high, affected voice. It was George 
Adkins — to choose a name only 
for identification purposes— who 
had recently spored and was so 
proud of the new life inside his 
body that there was no living 
with him. George said prissily, 
"Thank you, sir, I'm sure. Of 
course, I really shouldn't have 
exerted myself the way I just did, 
in my state." 

"Well, you'll be compensated 
for it," the Captain said testily. 
"Now take the humorist down to 
Assembly Five. We'll have a little 
ceremony there." 

"Yes, sir," said the Mate distantly. He moved off, shoving 
Tommy ahead of him, and dived 
into the first turning that led 
downward. 

They moved along in silence 
for the better part of a mile, crossing from one lesser passage to 
another until they reached a main 
artery that led directly to the 
center of the ship. The scanning 
waves were still stationary, and 
they were moving so swiftly that 
there was no danger of being 
overheard. Tommy said politely, 
"You won't let them be too hard 
on me, will you, sir?" 

The Mate did not reply for a 



moment. He had been baited byTommy's mock courtesy before, 
and he was as wary as his limited 
intelli gence allowed. Finally he 
said, "You'll get no more than 
what's coming to you, young 
Tom." 

"Yes, sir. I know that, sir. I'm 
sorry I made you exert yourself, 
sir, in your condition and all." 

"You should be," said the Mate 
stiffly, but his voice betrayed his 
pleasure. It was seldom enough 
that even a cabin boy showed a 
decent interest in the Mate's prospective parenthood. "They're 
moving about, you know," he 
added, unbending a little. 

"Are they, sir? Oh, you must 
be careful of yourself, sir. How 
many are there, please, sir?" 

"Twenty-eight," said the Mate, 
as he had on every possible occasion for the past two weeks. 
"Strong and healthy — so far." 

"That's remarkable, sir!" cried 
Tommy. "Twenty-eight 1 If I 
might be so bold, sir, you ought 
to be careful of what you eat. Is 
the Captain going to give you 
your extra rations out of that 
mass he just brought in topside, 
sir?" 

"I'm sure / don't know." 

"Gosh!" exclaimed Tommy. "I 
wish I could be sure — " 

He let the pause grow. Finally, 
the Mate said querulously, "What; 
do you mean? Is there anything 
wrong with the metal?" 



CABIN BOY 



n? 



•'I don't really know. sir. but 
it isn't like any we ever had before. That is," Tommy added, 
"since I was spored, sir." 

"Naturally," said the Mate. 
"I've eaten all kinds myself, you 
know." 

"Yes, sir. But doesn't it usually 
come in ragged shapes, sir, and 
darkish?" 

"Of course it does. Everybody 
knows that. Metal is non-living, 
and only living things have regular shapes." 

"Yes, sir. But I was topside, 
sir, while I was trying to get 
away, and I saw this metal. It's 
quite regular, except for some 
knobs at one end, sir, and it's as 
smooth as you are. sir, and shiny. 
If you'll forgive me, sir, it didn't 
look at all appetizing to me.** 

"Nonsense," said the Mate uncertainly. "Nonsense," he repeated, in a stronger tone. "You 
must have been mistaken. Metal 
can't be alive." 

"That's just what I thought, 
sir," said Tommy excitedly. "But 
there are live things in this metal, 
sir. I saw them. And the metal 
wasn't just floating along the way 
it's supposed to, sir. I saw it when 
the Captain brought it down, and 
. . . But I'm afraid you'll think 
I'm lying, sir, if I tell you what 
" it was doing." 

"Well, what was it doing?" 

"I swear I saw it, sir," Tommy 
went on. "The Captain will tell 



you the same thing, sir, if you 
ask him — he must have noticed." 

"Sterilize it all, what was it 
doing?" 

Tommy lowered his voice. 
"There was an ion trail shooting 
from it, sir. It was trying to get 
away !" 

While the Mate was trying to 
absorb that, they reached the bottom of the corridor and entered 
the vast globular space of Assembly Five, lined with crewmen 
waiting to witness the punishment 
of Tommy Loy. 

This was not going to be any 
fun at all. thought Tommy, but 
at least he had paid back the 
Third Mate in full measure. The 
Mate, for the moment, at any 
rate, was not taking any joy in 
his promised extra rations. 

WHEN it was over, Tommy 
huddled in a corner of the 
crew compartment where they 
had tossed him, bruised and 
smarting in every nerve, shaken 
by the beating he had undergone. 
The pain was still rolling through 
him in faint, uncontrollable 
waves, and he winced at each one, 
in spite of himself, as though it 
were the original blow. 

In the back of his mind, the 
puzzle of the metal ship was still 
calling, but the other experience 
was too fresh, the remembered 
images too vivid. 

The Captain had begun, as al


1*1 




 



ways, by reciting the Creed. 

In the beginning was the Spore, 
end the Spore was lone. 

(And the crew: Praised be the 
Spore!) 

Next there was light, and the 
light was good. Yea, good for the 
Spore and the Spore's First Children. 

{Praised be they!) 

But the light grew evil in the 
days of the Spore's Second Children. 

{Woe unto them!) 

And the light cast them out. 
Yea, exiled were they, into the 
darkness and the Great Deep. 

{Pity for the outcasts in the 
Great Deep!) 

Tommy had mumbled his response with the rest of them, 
thinking rebellious thoughts. 
There was nothing evil about 
light; they lived by it still. What 
must have happened — the Captain himself admitted as much 
when he taught history and natural science classes — was that the 
earliest ancestors of the race, 
spawned in the flaming heart of 
the Galaxy, had grown too efficient for their own good. 

They had specialized, more and 
more, in extracting energy from 
starlight and the random metal 
and other elements- they encountered in space; and at last they 
absorbed, willy-nilly, more than 
they could use. So they had 
moved, gradually and naturally. 



over many generations, out from 
that intensely radiating region 
into the "Great Deep" — the universe of thinly scattered stars. 
And the process had continued, 
inevitably; as the level of available energy fell, their absorption 
of it grew more and more efficient. 

Now, not only could they never 
return to their birthplace, but 
they could not even approach a 
single sun as closely as some 
planets did. Therefore the planets, and the stars themselves, were 
objects of fear. That was natural 
and sensible. But why did they 
have to continue this silly ritual, 
invented by some half-evolved, 
superstitious ancestor, of "outcasts" and "evil?" 

The Captain finished : 

Save us from the Death that 
lies in the Great Deep , . , 

{The creeping Death that lies 
in the Great Deep!) 

And keep our minds pure . . . 

{As pure as the light in the daya 
of the Spore, blessed be He!) 

And our course straight ... 

{As straight as the light, 
brothers!) 

That we may meet our lost 
brothers again in the Day of Reuniting. 

{Speed that day!) 

Then the pause, the silence that 
grew until it was like the silence 
of space. At last the Captain 
spoke again, pronouncing judgment against Tommy, ending: ^ 



CABIN BOY 



"Let him be whipped!" 

Tommy tensed himself, thickening his skin, drawing his body 
into the smallest possible compass. Two husky Ordinaries 
seized him and tossed him at a 
third. As Tommy floated across 
the room, the crewman pressed 
himself tightly against the wall, 
drawing power from it until he 
could contain no more. And as 
Tommy neared him, he discharged it in a crackling arc that 
filled Tommy's body with the 
pure essence of pain, and sent him 
hurtling across the chamber to 
the next shock — and the next — 
and the next — 

Until the Captain boomed, 
"Enough!" and they had carried 
him out and left him here atone. 

HE heard the voices of crewmen as they drew their rations. One of them was grumbling about the taste, and another, sounding happily bloated, 
was telling him to shut up and 
eat, that metal was metal. 

That would be the new metal, 
however much of it had been absorbed by now, mingled with the 
old in the reservoir. Tommy wondered briefly how much of it there 
was, and whether the alien ship — 
if it was a ship — could repair even 
a little damage to itself. But that 
assumed life in the metal, and in 
spite of what he had seen. Tommy 
couldn't believe in it. It seemed 



beyond question, though, that 
there were living things inside 
the metal; and when the metal 
was gone, how would they live? 

Tommy imagined himself set 
adrift from the ship, alone in 
space, radiating more heat than 
his tiny volume could absorb. He 
shuddered. 

He thought again of the problem that had obsessed him ever 
since he had seen the alien, fivepointed creatures in the metal 
ship. Intelligent life-was supposed 
to be sacred. That was part of 
the Creed, and it was stated in a 
sloppy, poetic way like the rest 
of tt. but it made a certain kind 
of sense. No crewman or Captain 
had the right to destroy another 
for his benefit, because the same 
heredity was in them all. They 
were all potentially the same, 
none better than another. 

And you ate metal, because 
metal was non-living and certainly not intelligent. But if that stopped being true. . . ? 

Tommy felt he was missing 
something. Then he had it: In 
the alien ship, trying to talk to 
the creatures that lived in metal, 
he had been scared almost scentless — but underneath the fright 
and the excitement, he had felt 
wonderful. It had been, he realized suddenly, like the mystic 
completion that was supposed to 
come when all the straight lines 
met, in the "Day of Reuniting" — 



110 




 



when all the far-flung ships, 
parted for all the billions of years 
tif their flight, came together at 
last. It was talking to someone 
different from yourself. 

He wanted to talk again to the 
aliens, teach them to form their 
uncouth sounds into words, learn 
from them . . . Vague images 
swirled in his mind. They were 
products of an utterly different 
line of evolution. Who knew what 
they might be able to teach him? 

And now the dilemma took 
shape. If his own ship absorbed 
the metal of theirs, they would 
die; therefore he would have to 
make the Captain let them go. 
But if he somehow managed to set 
thein free, they would leave and 
he would never see them again. 

A petty officer looked into the 
cubicle and said, "All right, Loy, 
out of it. You're on garbage detail. You eat after you work, if 
there's anything left. Lively, 
now !" 

Tommy moved thoughtfully out 
into the corridor, his pain almost 
forgotten. The philosophical 
problems presented by the alien 
ship, too, having no apparent solution, were receding from his 
mind. A new thought was taking 
their place, one that made him 
glow inside with the pure rapture of the devoted practical 
jok ester. * 

The whipping he was certainly 
going to get — and, so soon after 



the last offense, it would be * 
beauty — scarcely entered his 
mind. 

ROGET climbed in. opening 
his helmet, and sat down warily in the acceleration couch. He 
didn't look at the woman. 

McMenamin said quietly, 
"Bad?" 

"Not good. The outer skin's 
gone all across that area, and it's 
eating into the lead sheathing. 
The tubes are holding up pretty 
well, but they'll be next." 

"We've done as much as we 
can, by rolling the ship around?" 

"Just about. I'll keep at it, but 
I don't see how it can be more 
than a few hours before the tubes 
go. Then we're cooked, whatever 
your fragrant little friend does." 

He stood up abruptly and 
climbed over the slanting wall 
which was now their floor, to pc«r 
out the direct-view port. He 
swore, slowly and bitterly. "You 
try the radio again while I was 
out?" he asked. 

"Yes." She did not bother to 
add that there had been no response. Here, almost halfway between the orbits of Earth and 
Mars, they were hopelessly out 
of touch. A ship as small as theirs 
couldn't carry equipment enough 
to bridge the distance. 

Roget turned around, said, "By 



CABIN BOY 



131 



God — " And then clenched his 
jaw and strode out of the room. 
McMenamin heard htm walk 
through the bedroom and clatter 
around in the storage compartment behind. 

In a few moments he was back 
with a welding torch in his hand. 
"Should have thought of this before," he said. "I don't know 
what'll happen if I cut into that 
hull — damn thing may explode, 
for all I know — but it's better 
than sitting doing nothing." He 
put his helmet down with a bang 
and his voice came tinnily in her 
helmet receiver. "Be back in a 
minute." 

"Be careful," McMenamin said 
again. 

Roget closed the outer lock 
door behind him and looked at 
the ravished hull of the ship. The 
metal had been eaten away in a 
broad band all around the ship, 
just above the tail, as if a child 
had bitten around the small end 
of a pear. In places the clustered 
rocket tubes showed through like 
gnawed bones. He felt a renewed 
surge of anger, with fear deep 
under it. 

A hundred years ago, he reminded himself, the earliest space 
voyagers had encountered situations as bad as this one, maybe 
worse. But Roget was a city man, 
bred for city virtues. He didn't, he 
decided, know quite how to feel 
or act. What were you supposed 



to do when you were about to die, 
fifteen million miles from home? 
Try to calm McMenamin — who 
was dangerously calm already — 
or show your true nobility by 
making one of those death-bed 
speeches you read in the popular 
histories? What about suggesting 
a little suicide pact? There was 
nothing in the ship that would 
give them a cleaner death than 
the one ahead of them. About all 
he could do would be to stab 
Frances, then himself, with a 
screwdriver. 

Her voice said in the earphones, 
"You all right?" 

He said, "Sure. Just going to 
try it." He lowered himself to the 
green surface, careful not to let 
his knees touch the dark, corrosive area. The torch was a 
small, easily manageable tool. He 
pointed the snout at the dark area 
where it lapped up over the hull, 
turned the switch on and pressed 
the button. Flame leaped out, 
washing over the dark surface. 
Roget felt the heat through his 
suit. He turned off the torch to 
see what effect it had had. 

There was a deep, charred pit 
in the dark stuff, and it seemed 
to him that it had pulled back a 
little from the area it was attacking. It was more than he had expected. Encouraged, he tried 
again. 

There was a sudden tremor under him and he leaped nervously 




 



to his feet, just in time to avoid 
the corrosive wave as it rolled 
under him. For a moment he was 
only conscious of the thick metal 
of his boot soles and the thinness 
of the fabric that covered his 
knees; then, as he was about to 
step back out of the way, he 
realized that it was not only the 
dark ring that had expanded, that 
was still expanding. 

He moved jerkily — too late — as 
the pule center area swept toward 
and under him. Then he felt as 
if he had been struck by a mighty 
hammer. 

His ears rang, and there was a 
mist in front uf his eyes. He 
blinked, tried to raise an arm. It 
seemed to be stuck fast at the 
WflSl arid elbow. Panicked, he 
tried to push himself away and 
couldn't. As his vision cleared, he 
saw that he was spread-eagled on 
the pale disk that had spread out 
under him. The, metal collars of 
his wrist and elbow joints, all the 
metal parts of his suit, were held 
immovably. The torch lay a few 
inches away from his right hand. 

For a few moments, incredulously. Roget still tried to move. 
Then he stopped and lay in the 
prison of his suit, looking at the 
greenish-cream surface under his 
helmet. 

Frances* voice said abruptly, 
"Leo. is anything wrong?" 

Roget felt an instant relief that 
left him shaken and weak. His 



forehead was cold. He said after 
a moment, "Pulled a damn fool 
trick, Frances. Come out and help 
mc if you can." 

He heard a click as her helmet 
went down. He added anxiously, 
"But don't come near the pale 
part, or you'll get caught too." 

After a while she said, "Darling, I can't think of anything to 
do.'* 

Roget was feeling calmer, somehow not much afraid any more. 
He wondered how much oxygen 
was left in his suit. Not more than 
an hour, he thought. He said, "I 
know. I can't, either." 

Later he called, "Frances?" 

"Yes?" 

"Roll the ship once in a while, 
will you? Might get through to 
the wiring or something, otherwise." 

. . All right." 

After that, they didn't talk. 
There was a great deal to be said, 
but it was too late to say it.

"TOMMY was on garbage detail 
* with nine other unfortunates. 
It was a messy, hard, unpleasant 
business, fit only for a cabin boy 
— collecting waste from the compartment and corridor receptacles 
and pressing it into standard capsule-shapes, then hauling it to 
the nearest polarizer. But Tommy, under the suspicious eye of 



CABIN BOY 



the petty officer in charge, worked 
with an apparent total absorption 
until they had cleaned out their 
section of the six inmost levels 
and were well into the seventh. 

This was the best strategic 
place for Tommy's departure, 
since it was about midway from 
axis to hull, and the field of operations of any pursuit was correspondingly broadened. Also, the 
volume in which they labored had 
expanded wedgewise as they 
climbed, and the petty officer, 
though still determined to watch 
Tommy, could no longer keep 
him constantly in view. 

Tommy saw the officer disappear around the curve of the corridor, and kept on working busily. 
He was still at it, with every appearance of innocence and industry, when the officer abruptly 
popped into sight again about 
three seconds later. 

The officer stared at him with 
baffled disapproval and said unreasonably, "Come on, come on, 
Loy. Don't slack." 

"Right," said Tommy, and 
Scurried faster. 

A moment later Third Mate 
Ad kins hove majestically into 
View. The petty officer turned respectfully to face him. 

"Keeping young Tom well occupied, I see," said the Mate. 
? "Yes, sir," . said the officer. "Appears to be a reformed character, 
now, sir. Must have learned a 



lesson, one way or another." 

"Ha!" said the Mate. . "Very 
good. Oh, Loy, you might be interested in this — the Captain himself has told me that the new 
metal is perfectly all right. Unusually rich, in fact. I've had my 
first ration already — very good it 
was, too — and I'm going to get 
my extras in half an hour or so. 
Well, good appetite, all." And, 
while the lesser crewmen clustered 
against the walls to give him 
room, he moved haughtily off 
down the corridor. 

Tommy kept on working as 
fast as he could. He was draining 
energy he might need later, but it 
was necessary to quiet the petty 
officer's suspicions entirely, in order to give himself a decent start. 
In addition, his artist's soul demanded it. Tommy, in his own 
way, was a perfectionist. 

Third Mate Adkins was due to 
get his extras in about half an 
hour, and if Tommy knew the 
Captain's habits, the Captain 
would be taking his first meal 
from the newly replenished reservoir at about the same time. That 
set the deadline. Before the half 
hour was up, Tommy would have 
to cut off the flow of the new 
metal, so that stomachs which 
had been gurgling in anticipation 
would remain desolately void until the next windfall. 

The Mate, in spite of his hypochondria, was a glutton. With any 



131 




 



luck, this would make him bitter 
for a month. And the Old Man — 
but it was better not to dwell on 
that. 

The petty officer hung around 
irresolutely for another ten minutes, then dashed oFf down the 
corridor to attend to the rest of 
his detail. Without wasting a moment. Tommy dropped the capsule he had just collected a«d shot 
away in the other direction. 

The rest of the cabin boys, as 
fearful of Tommy as they were 
of constituted authority, would 
not dare to raise an outcry until 
they spotted the officer coming 
back. The officer, because of the 
time he had wasted in watching 
Tommy, would have to administer a thorough lecture on slackness to the rest of the detail before he returned. 

Tommy had calculated his 
probable margin to a nicety, and 
it was enough, barring accidents, 
to get him safely away. Nevertheless, he turned and twisted from 
one system of corridors to another, carefully confusing his trail 
before he set himself to put as 
much vertical distance behind 
him as he could. 

This part of the game had to 
be accomplished in a fury of action, for he was free to move in 
the corridors only until the Captain was informed that he was 
loose again. After that, he had to 
play hounds and hares with the 



moving strips through which the 
Captain could see him. 

When the time he had estimated was three-quarters gone, 
Tommy r slowed and came to a 
halt. He inspected the corridor 
wall minutely, and found the almost imperceptible trace that 
showed where the scanning wave 
nearest him had stopped. He jockeyed his body clear of it, and then 
waited. He still had a good distance to cover before he dared 
play his trump, but it was not 
safe to move now; he had to wait 
for the Captain's move. 

It came soon enough: the scanning waves erupted into simultaneous motion and anger. "Tommy!" they bellowed. "Tommy 
Loy ! Come back, you unmentionable excrescence, or by Spore 
you*ll regret it! Tommy!" 

Moving between 'waves, Tommy waited patiently until their 
motion carried him from one corridor to another. The Captain's 
control over the waves was not 
complete: in some corridors they 
moved two steps upward for one 
down, in others the reverse. When 
he got into a downward corridor. 
Tommy scrambled out of it again 
as soon as he could and started 
over. 

Gradually, with many false 
starts, he worked his way up to 
the thirteenth level, one level 
short of the hull. 

Now came the hard part. This 



CABIN BOY 



time he had to enter the fuel lines, 
not only for sure escape, but to 
gather the force he needed. And 
for the first time in his life. Tommy hesitated before something 
that he had set himself to do. 

Death was a phenomenon that 
normally touched each member 
of Tommy's race only once — only 
Captains died, and they died 
alone. For lesser members of the 
crew, there was almost no mortal 
clanger; the ship protected them. 
But Tommy knew what death 
was, and as the sealed entrance to 
the fuel line swung into view, he 
knew that he faced it. 

He made himself small, as he 
had under the lash. He broke the 
seal. Quickly, before the following 
wave could catch him. he thrust 
himself through the sphincter. 

The blast of ions gripped him, 
flung him forward, hurting him 
like a hundred whips. Desperately he held himself together, thickening his insulating shell against 
that deadly flux of energy; but 
still his body absorbed it, till he 
felt a horrid fullness. 

The walls of the tube fled past 
him, barely perceptible in the 
rush of glowing haze. Tommy 
held in that growing tautness with 
his last strength, meanwhile looking for an exit. He neither knew 
nor cared whether he had reached 
his goal ; he had to get out or die. 

He saw a dim oval on the wall 
ahead, hurled himself at it, clung, 




 



and forced his body through. 

He was in a horizontal corridor, 
just under the hull. He drank the 
Messed coolness of it for an instant, before moving to the nearest sphincter. Then he was out, 
under the velvet-black sky and 
the diamond blaze of stars. 

He looked around. The pain 
was fading now; he felt only an 
atrocious bloatedness that tightened Ins skin and made all his 
movements halting. Forward of 
him, up the long shallow curve 
of the hull, he could see the alien 
ship, and the two five-pointed 
creatures beside it. Carefully, 
keeping a few feet between himself and the hull, he headed toward it. 

One of the creatures was 
sprawled flat on the polarizer that 
had brought its ship down. The 
other, standing beside it, turned 
as Tommy came near, and two of 
its upper three points moved in 
an insane fashion that made Tommy feel ill. He looked away quickly and moved past them, till he 
was directly over the center of 
the polarizer and only a few 
inches away. 

Then, with a sob of relief, he 
released the energy his body had 
Stored; In one thick, white bolt, 
it sparked to the polarizer's center. 

Shaken and spent, Tommy 
floated upward and surveyed 
what he had done. The muzzle 

197 



of the polarizer was contracting, 
puckering at the center, the dark 
corrosive ring following it in. So 
much energy, applied in one jolt, 
must have shorted and paralyzed 
it all the way back to the ship's 
nerve center. The Captain, Tommy thought wryly, would be 
jumping now! 

And he wasn't done yet. Tommy took one last look at the aliens 
and their ship. The sprawled one 
was up now, and the two of them 
had their upper points twined 
around each other in a nauseating 
fashion. Then they parted suddenly, and, facing Tommy, wiggled their free points. Tommy 
moved purposefully off across the 
width of the ship, heading for the 
three heavy-duty polarizers. 

He had to go in again through 
that hell not once more, but 
twice. Though his nerves shrank 
from the necessity, there was no 
way of avoiding it. For the ship 
could not alter its course, except 
by allowing itself to be attracted 
by a sun or other large body — 
which was unthinkable • — or it 
could rotate at the Captain's will. 
The aliens were free now, but the 
Captain had only to spin ship in 
ordeT to snare them again. 

Four miles away, Tommy 
found the second polarizer. He 
backed away a carefully calculated distance before he re-entered the hull. At least he could 
know in advance how far he had 

m 



to go — and he knew now, too, 
that the energy he had stored the 
first time had been adequate twice 
over. He rested a few moments; 
then, like a diver plunging into a 
torrent, he thrust himself into the 
fuel line. 

He came out again, shuddering 
with pain, and pushed himself 
through the exit. He felt as bloated as he had before. The charge 
of energy was not as great, but 
Tommy knew that he was weakening. This time, when he discharged over the polarizer and 
watched it contract into a tiny, 
puckered mass, he felt as if he 
could never move again, let alone 
expose himself once more to that 
tunnel of flame. 

The stars, he realized dully, 
were moving in slow, ponderous 
arcs over his head. The Captain 
was spinning ship. Tommy sank 
to the hull and lay motionless, 
watching half -attentively for a 
sight of the alien ship. 

There it was, a bright dot haloed by the flame of its exhaust. 
It swung around slowly, gradually, with the rest of the firmament, growing smaller slowly. 

"He'll get them before they're 
out of range," Tommy thought. 
He watched as the bright dot 
climbed overhead, began to fall 
on the other side. 

The Captain had one polarizer 
left. It would be enough. 

Wearily Tommy rose and fol

lowed the bright star. It was not 
a joke any longer. He would willingly have gone inside to the 
bright, warm, familiar corridors 
that led downward to safety and 
deserved punishment. But somehow he could not bear to think of 
those fascinating creatures — those 
wonderful playthings — going to 
fill the Captain's fat belly. 

Tommy followed the ship until 
he could see the pale gleam of the 
functioning polarizer. Then he 
crawled through the hull once 
more, and again he found a sealed 
entrance to the fuel tube. He did 
not let himself think about it. His 
mind was numb already, and he 
pushed himself through uncaring, 
as condemned criminals often go 
carelessly to execution. 

This time it was worse than 
ever before; he had not dreamed 
that it could be so bad. His vi T 
sion dimmed and he could barely 
see the exit, or feel its pressure, 
when he dragged himself out. 
Lurching drunkenly, he passed a 
scanning wave on his way to the 
hull sphincter, and heard the 
Captain's voice explode. 

Outside, ragged black patches 
obscured his vision of the stars. 
The pressure inside him pressed 
painfully outward, again and 
again, and each time he held it 
back. Then he felt rather than 
saw that he was over the pale 
disk, and as he let go the bolt he 
lost consciousness. 



When his vision cleared, the 
alien ship was still above him,, 
alarmingly close. The Captain 
must have had it almost reeled in 
again, he thought, when he had 
let go that last charge. 

Flaming, it receded into the 
Great Deep, and he watched it 
go until it shrank beyond his vision to follow. 

He felt a great peace and a 
great weariness. The tiny blue 
disk that was a planet had moved 
its apparent position a little near^er its star. The aliens were going 
back there, to their unimaginable 
home, and Tommy's ship was 
forging onward into new depths 
of darkness — toward the edge of 
the Galaxy and the greatest Deep. 

He moved to the nearest 
sphincter as the cold bit at him. 
His spirits lifted suddenly as he 
thought of those three stabs of 
energy, equally spaced around 
the twelve-mile perimeter of the 
ship. The Captain would be utterly speechless with rage, he 
thought, like an aged martinet 
who had had his hands painfully 
slapped by a small boy. 

For, as we warned you, the 
Captain was not precisely a cap-< 
tain, nor the ship precisely a ship. 
Ship and Captain were one and 
the same, hive and queen; , bee* 
castle and lord. 

In effect, Tommy had circumnavigated the skipper.

what is POSAT? 



By PHYLLIS STERLING SMITH 



THE following advertisement appeared in the July 
1953 issue of several mag
ftZUKS : 

MASTERY OF ALL KNOWLEDGE

problems of life? Send for our FREE

POSAT 
an ancient secret society 

Most readers passed it by with 
scarcely a glance. It was, after 
all, similar to the many that had 



appeared through the years under the name of that same society. Other readers, as their eyes 
slid over the familiar format of 
the ad, speculated idly about the 
persistent and mildly mysterious 
organization behind it. A few 
even resolved to clip the attached 
coupon and send for the booklet 
— sometime — when a pen or pencil was nearer at hand. 

Bill Evans, an unemployed 
pharmacist, saw the ad in a copy 
of your Lite and Psychology that 
had been abandoned on his seat 
in the bus. He filled out the 
blanks on the coupon with a 
scrap of stubby pencil. "You can 
alter the course of your life!" he 
read again. He particularly liked 
that thought, even though he had 
long since ceased to believe it.

He actually took the trouble to 
mail the coupon. After all, he 
had, literally, nothing to lose, and 
nothing else to occupy his time. 

Miss Elizabeth Arnable was 
one of the few to whom the advertisement was unfamiliar. As a 
matter of fact, she very seldom 
read a magazine. The radio in her 
room took the place of reading 
matter, and she always liked to 
think that it amused her cats as 
well as herself. Reading would be 
so selfish under the circumstances, wouldn't it? Not but 
what the cats weren't almost 
smart enough to read, she al ways said. 

It just so happened, however, 
that she had bought a copy of the 
Anti vi vised ionist Gazette the 
day before. She pounced upon the 
POSAT ad as a trout might snap 
at a particularly attractive fly. 
Having filled out the coupon with 
violet ink, she invented an errand 
that would take her • past the 
neighborhood post office so that 
she could post it as soon as possible. 

Donald Alford. research physicist, came acros the POSAT ad 
tucked at the bottom of a column in The Bulletin of Physical 
Research. He was engrossed in 
the latest paper by Dr. Crandon, 
a man whom he admired from the 
point of view of both a former 
student and a fellow research 
worker. Consequently, he was 



one of the many who passed over 
the POSAT ad with the disregard 
accorded to any common object. 

He read with interest to the 
end of the article before he realized that some component of 
the advertisement had been noted 
by a region of his brain just beyond consciousness. It teased at 
him like a tickle that couldn't be 
scratched until he turned back to 
the page. 

It was the symbol or emblem 
of POSAT, he realized, that had 
caught his attention. The perpendicularly crossed ellipses centered with a small black circle 
might almost be a conventionalized version of the Bohr atom 
of helium. He smiled with mild 
skepticism as he read through the 
printed matter that accompanied 
it. 

"I wonder what their racket 
is," he mused. Then, because his 
typewriter was conveniently at 
hand, he carefully tore out the 
coupon and inserted it in the machine. The spacing of the typewriter didn't fit the dotted lines 
on the coupon, of course, but he 
didn't bother to correct it. He addressed an envelope, laid it with 
other mail to be posted, and 
promptly forgot all about it. 
Since he Was a methodical man, 
it wns entrusted to the U.S. mail 
early the next morning, together 
with his other letters.

panicd the booklet which POSAT 
sent in response to the three inquiries. The booklet gave no more 
information than had the original 
advertisement, but with considerable more volubility. It promised 
the recipient the secrets of the 
Cosmos and the key that would 
unlock the hidden knowledge 
within himself — if he would merely fill out the enclosed form. 

Bill Evans, the unemployed 
pharmacist, let the paper lie unanswered for several days. To be 
quite honest, he was disappointed. 
Although he had mentally disclaimed all belief in anything that 
POSAT might offer, he had 
watched the return mails with 
anticipation. His own resources 
were almost at an end, and he 
had reached the point where intervention by something super natural, or at least superhuman, 
seemed the only hope. 

He had hoped, unreasonably, 
that POSAT had an answer. But 
time lay heavily upon him, and 
he used it one evening to write the 
requested information — about his 
employment (ha!), his religious 
beliefs, his reason for inquiring 
about POSAT, his financial situation. Without quite knowing that 
he did so, he communicated in 
his terse answers some of -his desperation and sense of futility. 

Miss Arnable was delighted 
with the opportunity for autobiographical composition. It requir


ed five extra sheets of paper to 
convey all the information that 
she wished to give — all about her 
poor, dear father who had been a 
missionary to China, and the kinship that she felt toward the 
mystic cults of the East, her belief 
that her cats were reincarnations 
of her loved ones (which, she 
stated, derived from a religion of 
the Persians; or was it the Egyptians?) and in her complete and 
absolute acceptance of everything 
that POSAT had stated in their 
booklet. And what would the dues 
be? She wished to ^oin immediately. Fortunately, dear father 
had left her in a comfortable financial situation. 

To Dorrald Alford, the booklet 
seemed to confirm his suspicion 
that POSAT was a racket of some 
sort. Why else would they be interested in his employment or 
financial position? It also served 
to increase his curiosity. 

"What do you suppose they're 
driving at?" he asked his wife 
Betty, handing her the booklet 
and questionnaire. 

"I don't really know what to 
say," she answered, squinting a 
little as she usually did when 
puzzled. "I know one thing, 
though, and that's that you won't 
stop until you find out!" 

"The scientific attitude," he 
acknowledged with a grin. 

"Why don't you fill out this 
questionnaire incognito, though?" 



WHAT IS POSAT? 



143 



she suggested. "Pretend that we're 
wealthy and see if they try to get 
our money. Do they have anything yet except your name and 
address?" 

Don was shocked. "If I send 
this back to them, it will have to 
be with correct answers!" 

"The scientific attitude again," 
Betty sighed. "Don't you ever let 
your imagination run away with 
the facts a bit? What are you 
going to give for your reasons 
for asking about POSAT?" 

"Curiosity," he replied, and, 
pulling his fountain pen from his 
vest pocket, he wrote exactly that, 
in small, neat script. 

It was unfortunate for his curiosity that Don could not see the 
contents of the three envelopes 
that were mailed from the offices 
of POSAT the following week. 
For this time they differed. 

Bill Evans was once again disappointed. The pamphlet that 
was enclosed gave what apparently meant to be final answers 
to life's problems. They were 
couched in vaguely metaphysical 
terms and offered absolutely 
no help to him. 

His disappointment was tempered, however, by the knowledge 
that he had unexpectedly found 
a job. Or, rather, it had fallen 
into his lap. When he had 
thought that every avenue of employment had been tried, a position had been offered him in a 



wholesale pharmacy in the older 
industrial part of the city. It was 
not a particularly attractive place 
to work, located as it was next to 
a large warehouse, but to him it 
was hope for the future. 

It amused him to discover that 
the offices of POSAT were located 
on the other side of the same 
warehouse, at the end of a blind 
alley. Blind alley indeed! He felt 
vaguely ashamed for having 
placed any confidence in them. 

Miss Arnable was thrilled to 
discover that her envelope contained not only several pamphlets, (she scanned the titles 
rapidly and found that one of 
them concerned the sacred cats of 
ancient Egypt), but that it contained also a small pin with the 
symbol of POSAT wrought in 
gold and black enamel. The covering letter said that she had been 
accepted as an active member of 
POSAT and that the dues were 
five dollars per month ; please 
remit by return mail. She wrote a 
check immediately, and settled 
contentedly into a chair to peruse 
the article on sacred cats. 

After a while she began to 
read aloud so that her own cats 
could enjoy it, too. 

Don Alford would not have 
been surprised if his envelope had 
shown contents similar to the ones 
that the others received. The 
folded sheets of paper that he 
pulled forth, however, made him 



144 




 



Stiffen with sharp surprise. 

"Come here a minute, Betty," 
he called, spreading them out 
carefully on the dining room 
tabic. "What do you make of 
these?" 

She came, dish cloth in hand, 
and thoughtfully examined them, 
one by one. "Multiple choice 
questions' It looks like a psychological test of some sort." 

"This isn't the kind of thing I 
expected them to send me," worried Don. "Look at the type of 
thing they ask. 'If • you had discovered a new and virulent poison that could be compounded 
from common household ingredients, would you (1) publish the 
information in a daily newspaper, 
(2) manufacture it secretly and 
sell it as rodent exterminator, (3) 
give the information to the armed 
forces for use as a secret weapon, 
or (4) withhold the information 
entirely as too dangerous to be 
passed on?* " 

"Could they be a spy ring?" 
askprf Betty. "Subversive agents? 
Anxious to find out your scientific 
secrets like that classified stuff 
that you're so careful of when 
you bring it home from the lab?" 

Don scanned the papers quickly. "There's nothing here that 
looks like^an attempt to get information. Besides, I've told them 
nothing about my work except 
that 1 do research in physics. 
T hey don*t even know what 



company I work for. If this is a 
psychological test, it measures 
attitudes, nothing else. Why 
should they want to know my attitudes?" 

"Do you suppose that POSAT 
is really what it claims to be — a 
secret society — and that they actually screen their applicants?" 

He smiled wryly. "Wouldn't 
it be interesting if I didn't make 
the grade after starting out to expose their racket?" 

He pulled out his pen and sat 
down to the task of resolving the 
dilemmas before him. 

His next communication from 
POSAT came to his business address and, paradoxically, was 
more personal than its forerunners. 

Dear Doctor Alford: 

We have examined with interest the 
information that you have sent to us. 
We are happy to inform you that, 
thus far, you have satisfied the requirements for membership in the Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth, 
Before accepting new members into 
this ancient and honorable secret society, we find it desirable that they 
have a personal interview with the 
Grand Chairman of POSAT. 

Accordingly, you are cordially invited to an audience with our Grand 
Chairman on Tuesday, July 10. at 2:30 
P.M. Please let us know if this arrangement is acceptable to you If not, 
we will attempt to make another appointment for you.

pointment was hardly a convenient one for Don. At 2:30 P.M. on 
most Tuesdays, he would be at 
work in the laboratory. And while 
his employers made no complaint 
if he took his research problems 
home with him and worried over 
them half the night, they were 
not equally enthusiastic when he 
used working hours for pursuing 
unrelated interests. Moreover, the 
headquarters of POSAT was in a 
town almost a hundred miles distant. Could he afford to take a 
whole day off for chasing will-owisps? 

It hardly seemed worth the 
trouble. He wondered if Betty 
would be disappointed if he dropped the whole matter. Since the 
letter had been sent to the laboratory instead of his home, he 
couldn't consult her about it 
without telephoning. 

Since the tetter had been sent 
to the laboratory instead of his 
home! But it was impossible! 

He searched feverishly through 
his pile of daily mail for the envelope in which the letter had 
come. The address stared up at 
him. Unmistakably and fearfully 
legible. The name of his company. The number of the room 
he worked in. In short, the address that he had never given 
them! 

"Get hold of yourself," he commanded his frightened mind. 
"There's some perfectly logical,

easy explanation for this. They 
looked it up in the directory of 
the Institute of Physics. Or in the 
alumni directory of the university. Or — or—" 

But the more he thought about 
it, the more sinister it seemed.. 
His laboratory address was available, but why should POSAT 
take the trouble of looking it up? 
Some prudent impulse had led 
him to withhold that particular 
bit of information, yet now, for 
some reason of their own, POSAT 
had unearthed the information. 

His wife's words echoed in his 
mind, "Could they be a spy ring? 
Subversive agents?" 

Don shook his head as though 
to clear away the confusion. His 
conservative habit of thought 
made him reject that explanation 
as too melodramatic. 

At least one decision was easier 
to reach because of his doubts. 
Now he knew he had to keep his 
appointment with the Grand 
Chairman of POSAT. 

He scribbled a memo to^the 
department office stating that he 
would not be at work on Tuesday. 

AT first Don Alford had some 
trouble locating the POSAT 
headquarters. It seemed to him 
that the block in which the street 
number would fall was occupied 
entirely by a huge sprawling 
warehouse, of concrete construc

tion, and almost entirely windowless. It was recessed from the 
street in several places to make 
room for the small, shabby buildings of a wholesale pharmacy, a 
printer's plant, an upholstering 
shop, and was also indented by 
alleys lined with loading platforms. 

It was at the back of one of 
i the alleys that he finally found 

a door marked with the now familiar emblem of POSAT. 

He opened the frosted glass 
door with a feeling of misgiving, 
and faced a dark flight of stairs 
leading to the upper floor. Somewhere above him a buzzer sounded, evidently indicating his arrival. He picked his way up 
through the murky stairwell. 

The reception room was hardly 
a cheerful place, with its battered 
desk facing the view of the empty 
alley, and a film of dust obscuring the pattern of the gray-looking wallpaper and worn rug. But 
the light of the summer afternoon 
filtering through the window scattered the gloom somewhat, 
enough to help Don doubt that 
he would find the menace here 
that he had come to expect. 

The girl addressing envelopes 
at the desk looked very ordinary. 
Not the Mata Hart type, thought 
Don. with an inward chuckle nt 
his own suspici ons. He handed 
her the letter. 

She smiled. "We've been ex


pecting you. Dr. Alford. If you*H 
just step into the next room — " 

She opened a door opposite the 
stairwell, and Don stepped 
through it. 

The sight of the luxurious room 
before him struck his eyes with 
the shock of a dentist's drill, so 
great was the contrast between it 
and the shabby reception room. 
For a moment Don had difficulty 
breathing. The rug — Don had 
seen one like it before, but it had 
been in a museum. The paintings 
on the walls, ornately framed in 
gilt carving, were surely old masters — of the Renaissance period, 
he guessed. Although he recognized none of the pictures, he felt 
that he could almost name the 
artists. That glowing one near the 
corner would probably be a Titian. Or was it Tintorretto? He 
regretted for a moment the lost 
opportunities of his college days, 
when he had passed up Art History in favor of Operational Circuit Analysis. , 

The girl opened a filing cabinet, the front of which was set 
flush with the wall, and, selecting 
a folder from it, disappeared 
through another door. 

Don sprang to examine the picture near the corner. It was hung 
at eye level — that is, at the eye 
level of the average person. Don 
had to bend over a bit to see it 
properly. He searched for a signature. Apparently 1 there was 



WHAT IS POSAT? 



147 



none. But did artists sign their 
pictures back in those days? He 
wished he knew more about such 
things. 

Each of the paintings was individually lighted by a fluorescent tube held on brackets directly above it. As Don straightened 
up from his scrutiny of the picture, he inadvertently hit his head 
c gainst the light. The tube, dislodged from its brackets, fell to 
the rug with a muffled thud. 

Now I've done it! thought Don 
with dismay. But at least the 
tube hadn't shattered. 

In fact — it was still glowing 
brightly ! His eyes registered the 
fact, even while his mind refused 
to believe it. He raised his eyes 
to the brackets. They were simple 
pieces of solid hardware designed 
to support the tube. 

There were no wires! 

Don picked up the slender, 
glowing cylinder and held it between trembling fingers. Although 
it was delivering as much light as 
a two or three hundred watt bulb, 
it was cool to the touch. He examined it minutely. There was no 
possibility of concealed batteries. 

The thumping of his heart was 
caused not by the fact that he 
had never seen a similar tube before, but because he had. He had 
never held one in his hands, 
though. The ones which his company had produced as experi-. 
mental models had been unsuc


cessful at converting all of the 
radioactivity into light, and had, 
of necessity, been heavily shielded. 

Right now, two of his colleagues back in the laboratory 
would still be searching for the 
right combination of fluorescent 
material and radioactive salts 
with which to make the simple, 
efficient, self-contained lighting 
unit that he was holding in his 
hand at this moment! 

But this is impossible! he 
thought. We're the only company 
that's working on this, and it's 
secret. There can't be any in actual production! 

And even if one had actually 
been successfully produced, how 
would it have fallen into the possession of POSAT, an Ancient 
Secret Society, The Perpetual Order of Seekers After Truth? 

The conviction grew in Don's 
mind that here was something 
much deeper and more sinister 
than he would be able to cope 
with. He should have asked for 
help, should have stated his suspicions to the police or the F.B.I. 
Even now — 

With sudden decision, he thrust 
the lighting tube into his pocket 
and stepped swiftly to the outer 
door. He grasped the knob and 
shook it impatiently when it 
stuck and refused to turn. He 
yanked at it. His impatience 
changed to panic. It was locked! 



148 




 



A soft sound behind him made 
him whirl about. The secretary 
had entered again through the 
inner door. She glanced at the 
vacant light bracket, then significantly at his bulging pocket. 
Her gaze was still as bland and 
innocent as when he had entered, 
but to Don she no longer seemed 
ordinary. Her very calmness in 
the face of his odd actions was 
distressingly ominous. 

"Our Grand Chairman will see 
you now," she said in a quiet 
voice. 

Don realized that he was half 
crouched in the position of an 
animal expecting attack. He 
straightened up with what dignity 
he could manage to find. 

She opened the inner door 
again and Don followed her into 
what he supposed to be the office 
of the Grand Chairman of 
POSAT. 

Instead he found himself on 
a balcony along the side of a vast 
room, which must have been the 
interior of the warehouse that he 
had noted outside. The girl motioned him toward the far end of 
the balcony, where a frosted glass 
door marked the office of the 
Grand Chairman. 

But Don could not will his legs 
to move. His heart beat at the 
sight of the room below him. It 
was a laboratory, but a laboratory the like of which he had 
never seen before. Most of the 



equipment was unfamiliar to him. 
Whatever he did recognize was 
of a different design than he had 
ever used, and there was something about it that convinced him 
that this was more advanced. The 
men who bent busily over their 
instruments did not raise their 
eyes to the figures on the balcony. 

"Good' Lord!" Don gasped. 
"That's an atomic reactor down 
there!" There could be no doubt 
about it. even though he could 
see it only obscurely through the 
bluish-green plastic shielding it. 

His thoughts were so clamorous that he hardly realized that 
he had spoken aloud, or that the 
door at the end of the balcony 
had opened. 

He was only dimly aware of 
the approaching footsteps as he 
speculated wildly on the nature 
of the shielding material. What 
could be so dense that only an 
inch would provide adequate 
shielding and yet remain semitransparent? 

His scientist's mind applauded 
the genius who had developed it. 
even as the alarming conviction 
grew that he wouldn't — couldn't 
— be allowed to leave here any 
more. Surely no man would be 
allowed to leave this place alive 
to tell the fantastic story to the 
world ! 

"Hello, Don." said a quiet voice 
beside him. "It's good to see you 
again." 



WHAT IS POSAT?

: "Dr. Crandon!" he heard his 
own voice reply. "You're the 
Grand Chairman of POSAT?" 

He felt betrayed and sick at 
heart. The very voice with which 
Crandon had spoken conjured up 
visions of quiet lecture halls and 
his own youthful excitement at 
the masterful and orderly disclosure of scientific facts. To find 
him here in this mad and treacherous place ■ — didn't anything 
make sense any longer? 

"I think we have rather abused 
you, Don," Dr. Crandon continued. His voice sounded so gentle 
that Don found it hard to think 
there was any evil in it. "I can 
see that you are suspicious of us, 
and — yes — afraid." 

DON stared at the scene below 
him. After his initial glance 
to confirm his identification of 
Crandon, Don could not bear to 
look at him. 

Crandon's voice suddenly hardened, became abrupt. "YouVe 
partly right about us, of course. 
I hate to, think how many laws 
this organization has broken. 
Don't condemn us yet, though. 
You'll be a member yourself before the day is over." 



Don was shocked by such con-, 
fidence in his corruptibility. 

"What do you use?" he asked 
bitterly. "Drugs? Hypnosis?" 

Crandon sighed. "I forgot how 
little you know, Don. I have a

WHAT IS POSAT? 



151 



long story to tell you. You'll find 
it hard to believe at first. But try 
to trust me. Try to believe me, 
as you once did. When I say that 
much of what POSAT does is illegal. I do not mean immoral. 
We're probably the most moral 
organization in the world. Get 
over the idea that you have stumbled into a den of thieves." 

Crandon paused as though 
searching for words with which 
to continue. 

"Did you notice the paintings 
in the waiting room as you entered?" 

Don nodded, too bewildered to 

speak. 

"They were donated by the 
founder of our organization. 
Thc-y were part of his personal 
collection — which, incidentally, 
he bought from the artists themselves. He also designed the 
atomic reactor we use for power 
here in the laboratory." 

"Then the pictures are modern," said Don, aware that his 
mouth was hanging open foolishly. 'T thought one was a Titian — " 

. "It is," said Crandon. "We 
have several original Titians, although I really don't know too 
much about them." 

"But how could a man alive 
today buy paintings from an artist of the Renaissance?" 

"He is not alive today. POSAT 
is actually what our advertise


ments claim — an ancient secret 
society. Our founder has been 
dead for over four centuries." 

"But you said that he designed 
your atomic reactor." 

"Yes. This particular one has 
been in use for only twenty years, 
however." 

Don's confusion was complete. 
Crandon looked at him kindly. 
"Let's start at the beginning," he 
said, and Don was back again in 
the classroom with the deep voice 
of Professor Crandon unfolding 
the pages of knowledge in clear 
and logical manner. "Four hundred years ago, in the time of the 
Italian Renaissance, a man lived 
who was a super-genius. His was 
the kind of incredible mentality 
that appears not in every generation, or even every century, but 
once in thousands of years. 

"Probably the man who invented what we call the phonetic 
alphabet was one like him. That 
man lived seven thousand years 
ago in Mesopotamia, and his discovery was so original, so far 
from the natural course of man's 
thinking, that not once in the intervening seven thousand years 
has that device been rediscovered. 
It still exists only in the civilizations to which it has been passed 
on directly. 

"The super-genius who was our 
founder was not a semanticist. 
He was a physical scientist and 
mathematician. Starting with the 



152 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



meager heritage that existed in 
these fields in his time, he began 
tackling physical puzzles one by 
one. Sitting in his study, using as 
his principal tool his own great 
mind, he invented calculus, developed the quantum theory of 
light, moved on to electromagnetic radiation and what we call 
Maxwell's equations — although, 
of course, he antedated Maxwell 
by centuries — -developed the special and general theories of relativity, the tool of wave mechanics, and finally, toward the end 
of his life, he mathematically derived the packing fraction that 
describes the binding energy of 
nuclei—" 

"But it can't be done," Don 
objected- "It's an observed phenomenon. It hasn't been derived." 
Every conservative instinct that 
he possessed cried out against this 
impossible fantasy. And yet — 
there sat the reactor, sheathed in 
its strange shield. Crandon 
watched the direction of Don's 
glance. 

"Yes, the reactor," said Crandon. "He built one like it. It confirmed his theories. His calculations showed him something else 
too. He saw the destructive potentialities of an atomic explosion. He himself tould not have 
built an atomic bomb; he didn't 
have the facilities. But his knowledge would have enabled, other 
men to do so. He looked about 



him. He saw a political setup 
of warring principalities, rival 
states, intrigue, and squabbles 
over political power. Giving the 
men of his time atomic energy 
would have been like handing a 
baby a firecracker with a lighted 
fuse. 

"What should he have done? 
Let his secrets die with him? He 
didn't think so. No one else in 
his age could have derived the 
knowledge that he did. But it 
was an age of brilliant men. Leonardo. Michelangelo. There were 
men capable of learning his science, even as men can learn it 
today. He gathered some of them 
together and founded this society. 
It served two purposes. It perpetuated his discoveries and at 
the same time it maintained the 
greatest secrecy about them. He 
urged that the secrets be kept 
until the time when men could 
use them safely. The other purpose was to make that time come 
about as soon as possible." 

Crandon looked at Don's unbelieving face. "How can I make 
you see that it is the truth? Think 
of the eons that man or manlike 
creatures have walked the Earth. 
Think what a small fraction of 
that time is four hundred years. 
Is it so strange that atomic energy was discovered a little early, 
by this displacement in time that 
is so tiny after all?" 

"But by one man," Don argued. 



WHAT IS POSAT? 



1$3 



Crandon shrugged. "Compared 
with him, Don, you and I are 
stupid men. So are the scientists 
who slowly plodded down the 
same road he had come, stumbling first on one truth and then 
the succeeding one. We know that 
inventions and discoveries do not 
occur at random. Each is based 
on the one that preceded it. We 
are all aware of the phenomenon 
of simultaneous invention. The 
path to truth is a straight one. 
It is only our own stupidity that 
makes it seem slow and tortuous. 

"He merely followed the 
straight path," Crandon finished 
simply. 

DON's incredulity thawed a little. It was not entirely beyond the realm of possibility. 

But if it were true! A vast panorama of possible achievements 
spread before him. 

"Four hundred years!" he murmured with awe. "You've had 
four hundred years* head-start on 
the rest of the world! What wonders you must have uncovered in 
that time!" 

"Our technical achievements 
may disappoint you," warned 
Crandon. "Oh, they're way beyond anything that you are familiar with. You've undoubtedly 
noticed the shielding material on 
the reactor. That's a fairly recent development of our metallurgical department. There are 



other things in the laboratory 
that I can't even explain to you 
until you have caught up on the 
technical basis for understanding 
them. 

"Our emphasis has not been 
on physical sciences, however, except as they contribute to our 
central project. We want to 
change civilization so that it can 
use physical science without disaster." 

For a moment Don had been 
fired with enthusiasm. But at 
these words his heart sank. 

"Then you've failed," he said 
bitterly. "In spite of centuries of 
advance warning, you've failed to 
change the rest of us enough to 
prevent us from trying to blow 
ourselves off the Earth. Here we 
are, still snarling and snapping 
at our neighbors' throats — and 
we've caught up with you. We 
have the atomic bomb. What's 
POSAT been doing all that time? 
Or have you found that human 
nature really can't be changed?" 

"Come with me," said Crandon. 

He led the way along the narrow balcony to another door, 
then down a steep flight of stairs. 
He opened a door at the bottom, 
and Don saw what must have 
been the world's largest computing machine. 

"This is our answer," said 
Crandon. "Oh, rather, it's the tool 
by which we find our answer.

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



For two centuries we have been 
working on the newest of the sciences — that of human motivation. 
Soon we will be ready to put 
some of our new knowledge to 
work. But you are right in one 
respect, we are working now 
against time. We must hurry if 
we are to save our civilization. 
That's why you are here. We 
have work for you to do. Will you 
join us, Don?" 

"But why the hocus-pocus?" 
asked Don. "Why do you hide 
behind such a weird front as 
POSAT? Why do you advertise 
in magazines and invite just anyone to join? Why didn't you approach me directly, if you have 
work for me to do? And if you 
really have the answers to our 
problems, why haven't you gathered together all the scientists in 
the world to work on this project 
—before it's too late?" 

Crandon took a sighing breath. 
"How I wish that we could do 
just that! But you forget that one 
of the prime purposes of our organization is to maintain the secrecy of our discoveries until they 
can be safely disclosed. We must 
be absolutely certain that anyone 
who enters this building will have 
joined POSAT before he leaves. 
What if we approached the wrong 
scientist ? Centuries of accom plishment might be wasted if they 
attempted either to reveal it or 
to exploit it! 



"Do you recall the questionnaires that you answered before 
you were invited here? We fed 
the answers to this machine and, 
as a result, we know more about 
how you will react in any given 
situation than you do yourself. 
Even if you should fail to join 
us, our secrets would be safe with 
you. Of course, we miss a few of 
the scientists who might be perfect material for our organization. 
You'd be surprised, though , at 
how clever our advertisements 
are at attracting exactly the men 
we want. With the help of our 
new science, we have baited our 
ads well, and we know how to 
maintain interest. Curiosity is. to 
the men we want, a powerful 
motivator." 

"But what about the others?" 
asked Don. "There must be hundreds of applicants who would 
be of no use to you at all." 

"Oh, yes." replied Crandon. 
"There are the mild religious fanatics. We enroll them as members and keep them interested by 
sending pamphlets in line with 
their interests. Wc even let them 
contribute to our upkeep, if they 
seem to want to. They never get 
bf-yond the reception room if they 
come to call on us. But they are 
additional people through whom 
we can act when the time finally 
comes. 

"There are also the desperate 
people who try POSAT as a last

their direction in life. For them 
we put into practice some of our 
newly won knowledge. We rehabilitate them — anonymously, 
of course. Even find jobs or patch 
up homes. It's good practice for 
us. 

"I think I've answered most of 
your questions, Don. But you 
haven't answered mine. Will you 
join us?" 

Don looked solemnly at the orderly array of the computer be


fore him. He had one more question. 

"Will it really work? Can it 
actually tell you how to motivate 
the stubborn, quarrelsome, opinionated people one finds on this 
Earth?" 

Crandon smiled. "You're" here, 
aren't you?" , 

Don nodded, his tense features 
relaxing. 

"Enroll nic as a member," he 
said.

 . 

Dear Sirs 

Being an occasional reader of Science Fictioa, I bought 1 
the April, 1951, edition of your magazine. Reading it 
through I was extremely gratified and pleased to learn 
of the emphasis many of the stories placed on human relations. "Inside Earth" by Foul Anderson, in particular, handled a human relations theme extremely well* 
Several of the other stories in the magazine also involved such a theme in one form or another* 

On behalf of the Commission on Human Relations I should 
like to congratulate you for your foresightedness in em—' 
phasizing these themes in your stories. I certainly 
think and I am sure you will agree with me that one of 
the attributes of a future world, no matter how distant in the future, should be complete understanding 
among all peoples and all groups and the complete 
absence of discriminatory practices because of race, 
creed and national origin that occupy our present-day 
world. The advantages of the space ships, interplanetary 
travel, push-button living, and a host of other materialistic features of the time yet to come will be greatly 
diminished if people cannot learn the spiritual values 
of understanding decent relations among all groups. 

Thanks for doing your part to achieve such an objectives 

Sincerely yours,

The Biography Project 



By DUDLEY DILI 

A bonus story , . . scheduled too late 
to be included on the contents page! 



THERE was something tremendously exciting about 
the opening of the Biofilm 
Institute. Even a hardened Sunday supplement writer like Wellman Zatz felt it. 

Arlington Prescott. a wiper in 
a contact-eyeglass factory, while 
searching for a time machine, had 
invented the Biotime Camera, a 
standard movie camera — minus 
sound, of course — that projected 
a temporal beam, reaccumulated 
it, and focused it on a temporallight -sensitized film. When he 
discovered that he had to be satisfied with merely photographing 
the past, not physically visiting 
it, Prescott had quit doing research and become principal of a 
nursery school. 

But, Zatz explained, dictating 
his notes by persfone to a voxtyper in the telenews office, the 
Biofilm Institute was based on 
Prescott's repudiated invention. 
A huge, massive building, mostly 



below ground, in the 23rd Century style, and equipped with 
1 ,000 Biotime Cameras, it was 
the gift of Humboldt Maxwell, 
wealthy manufacturer of Snack 
Capsules. There were 1,000 teams 
of -biographers, military analysts, 
historians, etc., to begin recording 
history as it actually happened— 
with special attention, according 
to Maxwell's grant, to past leaders of industry, politics, science, 
and the arts, in the order named. 

Going through the Biofilm Institute, Wellman Zatz gained 
mostly curt or snarled interviews 
with the Bioteams; fishing 
through time for incidents or persons was a nervous job, and they 
resented interruptions. 

He settled finally on a team 
that seemed slightly friendlier. 
They were watching what looked 
like a scene from Elizabethan 
England on the monitor screen.

Burns, the science biographer.

grunted in reply to Zatz's question. "Great man. We want to 
find out why he went off the 
beam." 

Zatz knew about that, of 
course. Sunday feature articles 
for centuries had used the case of 
Sir Isaac to support arguments 
for psychic phenomena. After 
making all his astonishing discoveries by the age of 25, the 
great 17th Century scientist had 
spent the rest of his long life in a 
hunt for precognition, the philosopher's stone, and other such 
paraphernalia of mysticism. 

"My guess," said Mowbray 
Glass, the psychiatrist, "is paranoia caused by feelings of rejection in childhood." 

But the screen showed a happy 
boy in what seemed to be a normal 1 7 th Century home and 
school environment. Glass grew 
puzzled as Sir Isaac eventually 
produced his binomial theorem, 
differential and integral calculus, 
and went to work on gravity — all 
without evidencing any symptoms of emotional imbalance. 

"The most unbelievable demonstrative and deductive powers I've encountered," said Pinero 
Schmidt, the science integrator. 
"I can't believe such a man could

"But he did," Glass said, and 
tensed. "Lookl"

screen, wearing a satin coat, stock 
and breeches, glanced up sharply. 
He looked directly into the temporal beam for a moment, and 
then stared into the shadows of 
the room. He grabbed up a silver 
Candlestick and searched the corners, holding the heavy candlestick like a weapon. 

"He's mumbling something," 
reported Gonzalez Carson, the 
lip-reader. "Spies. He thinks 
somebody's after his discoveries."

Burns looked puzzled. "Thafs 
the first sign we've seen of breakdown. But what caused it?" 

"I'm damned if I know," 
admitted Glass. 

"Heredity?" Zatz suggested. 

"No," Glass said positively. 
"It's been checked." 

The Bioteam spent hours prying further. When the scientist 
was in his thirties, he developed 
a continuing habit of looking up 
and smiling secretly. On his 
deathbed, forty yqars later, he 
moved his lips happily, without 
fear. 

'* My guardian angel,' " Carson 
interpreted for them. " 'You've 
watched over me all my life. I 
am content to meet you now.' " 

Glass started. He went to one 
Bioteam after another, asking a 
brief question of each. When he 
came back, he was trembling. 

"What's the answer. Doc?" 
Zatz asked eagerly. 

"We can't use the Biotime 
Camera any more," Glass said, 
looking sick. "My colleagues have 
been investigating the psychoses 
of Robert Schumann, Marcel 
Proust and others, who all eventually developed delusions of persecution." 

"Yeah, but why?" Zatz persisted. 

"Because they thought they 
were being spied upon. And they 
were, of course. By us!"

THE ALIEN 

by 

Raymond F. Jones 



Just speculate for a moment on the enormous 
challenge to archeology when interplanetary 
flight is possible . . . and relics are found of a 
race extinct for half a million years! A race, incidentally, that was scientifically so far in advance of ours that they held the secret of the 
restoration of life! 

One member of that race can be brought back 
after 500,000 years of death . . . 

That's the story told by this ORIGINAL booklength novel, which has never before been published' You can expect a muscle-tightening, 
sweat-producing, mind-prodding adventure in 
the future when you read it!
