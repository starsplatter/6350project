CABIN BOY BY DAMON KNIGHT

THE cabin boy's name was 
unspeakable, and even its 
meaning would be difficult 
to convey in any human tongue. 
For convenience, we may as well 
call him Tommy Loy. 

Please bear in mind that* all 
these terms are approximations. 
Tommy was not exactly a cabin 
boy, and even the spaceship he 
served was not exactly a spaceship, nor was the Captain exactly 



a captain. But if you think of 
Tommy as a freckled, scowling, 
red-haired, willful, prank-playing, 
thoroughly abhorrent brat, and of 
the Captain as a crusty, ponderous old man, you may be able to 
understand their relationship. 

A word about Tommy will 
serve to explain why these approximations have to be made, 
and just how much they mean.' 
Tommy, to a human being, would 




 



have looked like a six-foot egg 
made of greenish gelatin. Suspended in this were certain dark 
or radiant shapes which were 
Tommy's nerve centers and digestive organs,, and scattered about 
its surface were star-shaped and 
oval markings which were his sensory organs and gripping. mechanisms — his "hands." At the lesser 
end was an orifice which expelled 



a stream of glowing vapor, Tom* 
my's means of propulsion. It 
should be clear that if instead of 
saying, "Tommy ate his lunch," 
or, "Tommy said to the Captain—" we reported what really 
happened, some pretty complicated explanations would have to 
be made. 'f , . 

Similarly, the term "cabin boy** 
is used because it is the closest

in human meaning. Some vocations, like seafaring, are so demanding and so complex that 
they simply cannot be taught in 
classrooms; they have to be lived. 
A cabin boy is one who is learning such a vocation and paying 
for his instruction by performing 
certain menial, degrading, and 
unimportant tasks. 

That certainly describes Tommy, with one more similarity — 
the cabin boy of the sailing vessel was traditionally occupied 
after each whipping with preparing the mischief, or the stupidity, 
that earned him the next one. 

Tommy, at the moment, had 
e whipping coming to him, and 
was fighting a delaying action. He 
knew he couldn't escape eventual 
punishment, but he planned, with 
a wholehearted determination, to 
hold it off as long as he could. 

Floating alertly in one of the 
innumerable corridors of the ship, 
he watched as a dark wave sprang 
into being upon the glowing corridor wall and sped toward him. 
Instantly, Tommy was moving 
away from it, and at the same 
rate of speed. 

The wave rumbled: "Tommy! 
Tommy Loy ! Where is that obscenity boy?" 

The wave moved on, rumbling 
wordlessly, and Tommy moved 
with it. Ahead of him was another 
wave, and another beyond that, 
and it was the same throughput 



all the corridors of the ship. 
Abruptly the waves reversed their 
direction. So did Tommy,* barely 
in time. The waves not only carried the Captain's orders, but 
scanned every corridor and com' 
partment of the ten-mile ship. 
But as long as Tommy kept be- i 
tween the waves, the Captain 
could not see him. 

It did not strike Tommy as odd 
that the Captain never thought * 
of keeping the scanning waves 
stationary and letting the search 
parties catch up to him. The Captain, like all the rest of the crew, 
was not very bright in comparison with Tommy. This was odd 
enough, but Tommy had long 
since given up trying to puzzle 
out the reason. It was part of his 
universe. 

The trouble was that he could 
not keep this up forever, and he 
was being searched for by other 
lowly members of the crew. It 
took a long time to traverse each 
of those' winding, interlaced passages, but it was a mathematical 
certainty that he would be caught 
eventually. 

Tommy shuddered, and at the 
same time he squirmed with delight. He had interrupted the Old 
Man's sleep by a stench- of a particularly noisome variety, one. of 
which he had only lately found 
himself capable. The effect had 
been beautiful. In human terms, 
since Tommy's race communi


ng 




 



cated by odors, it was equivalent 
to setting off a firecracker beside 
a sleeper's ear. 

Judging by the jerkiness of the 
scanning waves' motion, the Old 
Man was still unnerved. 

"Tommy!" the waves rumbled. 
"Come out, you little piece of 
filth, or I'll smash you into a 
thousand separate stinks ! By 
Spore, when I get hold of you — " 

The corridor intersected another at this point, and Tommy 
seized his chance to duck into the 
new one. He had been working 
his way outward ever since his 
crime, knowing that the search 
parties would do the same. When 
he reached the outermost level of 
the ship, there would be a slight 
possibility of slipping back past 
the hunters — not much of a 
chance, but better than none. 

He kept close to the wall. He 
was the smallest member of the 
crew — smaller than any of the 
Other cabin boys, and less than 
half the size of an Ordinary; it 
was always possible that when he 
sighted one of the search party, 
he could get away before the 
crewman saw him. He was in a 
short connecting corridor now, 
but the scanning waves cycled 
endlessly, always turning back 
before he could escape into the 
next corridor. Tommy followed 
their movement patiently, while 
he listened to the torrent of abuse 
that poured from them. He snick


ered fragrantly to himself. When 
the Old Man was angry, everybody suffered. The ship would 
be stinking from stem to stern by 
now. 

pWENTUALLY the Captain 
forgot himself and the waves 
flowed on around the next intersection. Tommy moved on. He 
was getting close to his goal by 
now; he could see a faint gleam 
of starshine up at the end of the 
corridor. 

The next turn took him into 
it — and what Tommy saw 
through the semi-transparent skin 
of the ship nearly made him falter and get caught. Not merely 
the fiery pinpoints of stars shone 
there, but a great, furious glow 
which could only mean that they 
were passing through a star system. It was the first time this had 
happened in Tommy's life, but 
of course it was nothing to the 
Captain, or even to most of the 
Ordinaries. Trust them, Tommy 
thought resentfully, to say nothing to him about it! 

Now he knew he was glad he'd 
tossed that surprise at the Captain. If he hadn't, he wouldn't be 
here, and if he weren't here — 

A waste capsule was bumping 
automatically along the corridor, 
heading for one of the exit pores 
in the hull. Tommy let it catch 
up to him. then englobed it, but 
it stretched him so tight that he 



CABIN BOY 



119 



could barely hold it. That was all 
to the good; the Captain wouldn't 
be likely to notice that anything 
had happened. 

The hull was sealed, not to keep 
atmosphere inside, for there was 
none except by accident, but to 
prevent loss of liquid by evaporation. Metals and other mineral 
elements were replaceable: liquids 
and their constituents, in ordinary 
circumstances, were not. 

Tommy rode the capsule to the 
exit sphincter, squeezed through, 
and instantly released it. Being 
polarized away from the ship's 
core, it shot into space and was 
lost. Tommy hugged the outer 
surface of the hull, and gazed at 
the astonishing panorama that 
surrounded him. 

There was the enormous black 
half-globe of space — Tommy's 
sky. the only one he had ever 
known. It was sprinkled with the 
familiar yet always changing patterns of the stars. By themselves, 
these were marvels enough for a 
child whose normal universe was 
one of ninety-foot corridors and 
chambers measuring, at most, 
three times as much. But Tommy 
hardly noticed them. Down to his 
right, reflecting brilliantly from 
the long, gentle curve of the 
greenish hull, was a blazing yellow-white glory that he could 
hardly look at. A star, the first 
one he had ever seen close at 
band. Off to the left was a tiny, 



milky -blue disk that could only 
be a planet. 

Tommy let go a shout, for the 
sheer pleasure of its thin, hollow 
sound, or, if you prefer, smell. 
He watched the thin mist of particles spread lazily away from his 
body, faintly luminous against 
the jet blackness. He shivered a 
little, thickening his skin as much 
as he could. He could not stay 
long, he knew; he was radiating 
heat faster than he could absorb 
it from the sun on the ship's hull. 

But he didn't want to go back 
inside, and not only because it 
meant bt-ing caught and punished. 
He didn't want to leave that 
great, dazzling jewel in the sky. 
For an instant he thought vaguely 
of the future time when he would 
be grown, the master of his own 
vessel, and could see the stars 
whenever he chose; but the picture was too far away to have 
any reality. Great Spore, that 
wouldn't happen for twenty thousand years! 

Fifty yards away, an enormous 
dark spot on the hull, one of the 
ship's vision devices, swelled and 
darkened. Tommy looked up with 
interest. He could see nothing in 
that direction, but evidently the 
Captain had spotted something. 
Tommy watched and waited, 
growing colder every second, and 
after a long time he saw a new 
pinpoint of light spring into being. 
It grew steadily larger, turned

fuzzy at one side, then became 
two linked dots, one hard and 
bright, the other misty. 

Tommy looked down with sudden understanding, and saw that 
another wide area of the ship's 
hull was swollen and protruding. 
This one showed a pale color under the green and had a dark ring 
around it: it was a polarizer. The 
object he had seen must contain 
metal, and the Captain was bringing it in for fuel. Tommy hoped 
it was a big one; they had been 
short of metal ever since he could 
remember. 

When he glanced up again, the 
object was much larger. He could 
see now that the bright part was 
hard and smooth, reflecting the 
light of the nearby sun. The misty 
part was a puzzler. It looked like 
a crewman's voice, seen against 
space — or the ion trail of a ship 
in motion. But_was it possible for 
metal to be alive? 

T EO ROGET stared into the 
rear-view scanner and wiped 
beads of sweat from his brown, 
half -bald scalp. Flaming gas from 
the jets washed up toward him 
along the hull; he couldn't see 
much. But the huge dark void 
they were headed for was still 
there, and it was getting bigger. 
He glanced futilely at the 'control 
board. The throttle was on full. 



They were going to crash In a little more than two minutes, and 
there didn't seem to be a single 
thing he could do about it. 

He looked at Frances McMenamin, strapped into the acceleration harness .beside his own. She 
said, "Try cutting off the jets, 
why don't you?" 

Roget was a short, muscular 
man with not very much straight 
black hair and sharp brown eyes. 
McMenamin was slender and 
ash-blonde, half an inch taller 
than he was. with one of those 
pale, exquisitely shaped faces that 
seem to be distributed equally 
among the very stupid and the 
very bright. Roget had never been 
perfectly sure which she was, although they had been companions 
for more than three years. That, 
in a way, was part of the reason 
they had taken this pretty wild 
trip: she had made Roget uneasy, 
and he wanted to break away, 
and at the same time he didn't. 
So he had fallen in with her idea 
of a trip to Mars — "to get off by 
ourselves and think" — and here, 
Roget thought, they were, not 
thinking particularly. 

He said, "You want us to crash 
quicker?" 

"How do you know we will?"* 
she countered. "It's the only thing 
we haven't tried. Anyhow, we'd 
be able to see where we're going, 
and that's more than we can do 
now." 



C A I I N BOY 



II* 



"All right," said Roget, "all 
right." She was perfectly capable 
of giving him six more reasons, 
each screwier than the last, and 
then turning out to be justified. 
He pulled the throttle back to 
zero, and the half-heard, half-felt 
roar of the jets died. 

The ship jerked backward suddenly, yanking them against the 
couch straps, and then slowed. 

Roget looked into the scanner 
again. They were approaching the 
huge object, whatever it was, at 
about the same rate as before. 
Maybe, he admitted unwillingly, 
a little slower. Damn the woman! 
How could she possibly have figured that one out in advance? 

"And," McMenarnin added 
reasonably, "we'll save fuel for 
the takeoff." 

Roget scowled at her. "If there 
is a takeoff," he said. "Whatever 
is pulling us down there isn't doing it to show off. What do we 
do — tell them that was a very 
impressive trick and we enjoyed 
it, but we've' got to be leaving 
now?" 

"We'll find out what's doing 
it," said McMenarnin, "and stop 
it if we can. If we can't, the fuel 
won't do us any good anyway." 

That was, if not Frances' most 
exasperating trick, at least high 
on the list. She had a habit of 
introducing your own argument 
as if it were not only a telling 
point on her side, but something 



you had been "too dense to see. 
Arguing with her was like swinging at someone who abruptly disappeared and then sandbagged 
you from behind. 

Roget was fuming, but he said 
nothing. The greenish surface below was approaching more and 
more slowly, and now he felt a 
slight but definite tightening of 
the couch straps that could only 
mean deceleration. They were 
being maneuvered in for a landing as carefully and efficiently as 
if they were doing it themselves. 

A few seconds later, a green 
horizon line appeared in the directview ports, and they touched. 
Roget's and McMenaniin's couches swung on their gimbals as the 
ship tilted slowly, . bounced and 
came to rest. 

Frances reached inside the wide 
collar of her pressure suit to 
smooth a ruffle that had got 
crumpled between the volcanic 
swell of her bosom and the front 
of the transparent suit. Watching 
her, Roget felt a sudden irrational 
flow of affection and — as usually 
happened — a simultaneous notification that his body disagreed 
with his mind's opinion of her. 
She was nuts, but he couldn't do 
without her. This trip, it had been 
tacitly agreed, was to be a kind 
of final trial period. At the end of 
it, either they would split up or 
decide to make it permanent, and 
up to now, Roget had been si


120 




 



lently determined that it was going to be a split. Now he was just 
as sure that, providing they ever 
got to Mars or back to Earth, he 
was going to nail her for good. 

He glanced at her face. She 
knew, all right, just as she'd 
known when he'd felt the other 
way. It should have irritated him, 
but he felt oddly pleased and 
comforted. He unstrapped himself, fastened down his helmet, 
and moved toward the airlock. 

"Be careful," she said. 

"Yeah." He looked at her. "Be 
back in a minute." 

She smiled — not a big one, for 
show, but the little, quiet kind 
that lit up her face. Roget grinned 
back and closed the airlock door 
behind him. 

He stood on a pale -green, almost featureless surface that 
curved gently away in every direction. Where he stood, it was 
brilliantly lit by the sun, and his 
shadow was sharp and as black 
as space. About two-thirds of the 
way to the horizon, looking across 
the short axis of the ship, the 
sunlight stopped with knife-edge 
sharpness, and he could make out 
the rest only as a ghostly reflection of starlight. 

Their ship was lying on its side, 
with the pointed stern apparently 
sunk a few inches into the green 
surface of the alien ship. He took 
a cautious step in that direction, 
and nearly floated past it before 



he could catch himself. His boot 
magnets had failed to grip. The 
metal of this hull — if it was metal 
— must be something that contained no steel. 

The green hull was shot 
through with other colors here, 
and it rose in a curious, almost 
rectangular mound. At the center, 
just at the tip of the Earth vessel's jets, there was a pale area; 
around that was a dark ring 
which lapped up over the side of 
the ship. He bent to examine it. 
It was in shadow, and he used his 
helmet light. 

The light shone through the 
mottled green substance; he could 
see the skin of his own ship. It 
was pitted, corroding. As he 
watched, another pinpoint of corruption appeared on the shiny 
surface, and slowly grew. 

Roget straightened up with an 
exclamation. His helmet phones 
asked, "What is it, Leo?" 

He said, "Acid or something 
eating the hull. Wait a minute." 
He looked again at the pale and 
dark mottlings under the green 
surface. The center area was not 
attacking the ship's metal; that 
might be the muzzle of whatever 
instrument had been used to pull 
them down' out of their orbit and 
hold them there. But if it waS 
turned off now — He had to get 
the ship away from the dark ring 
that was destroying it. He 
couldn't fire the jets otherwise, 



CABIN BOY 



121 



because they were half -buried ; 
he'd blow the tubes if he tried. 

He said, "You still strapped 
in?" 

"Yes." 

"All right, hold on." He stepped 
back to the center of the little 
ship, braced his corrugated boot 
soles against the hard green surface, and shoved. 

The ship rolled. But it rolled 
like a top, around the axis of its 
pointed end. The dark area gave 
way before it, as if it were jellysoft. The jets still pointed to the 
middle of the pale area, and the 
dark ring still lapped over them. 
Roget moved farther down and 
tried again, with the same result. 
The ship would move freely in 
every direction but the right one. 
The attracting power, clearly 
enough, was still on. 

IIF, straightened dejectedly and 
looked around. A few hundred yards away, he saw something he had noticed before, without attaching any significance to 
it: a six-foot egg, of some lighter, 
more translucent substance than 
the one on which it lay. He 
leaped toward it. It moved sluggishly away, trailing a cloud of 
luminous gas. A few seconds later 
he had it between his gloved 
bands. It squirmed, then ejected 
tt thin spurt of vapor from its 
forward end. It was alive. 

McMenamin's head was sil


houetted in one of the forward 
ports. He said, "See this?" 

"Yes! What is it?" 

"One of the crew, I think. I'm 
going to bring it in. You work the 
airlock — it won't hold both of us 
at once." 

"... All right." 

The huge egg crowded the 
cabin uncomfortably. It was 
pressed up against the rear wall, 
where it had rolled as soon as 
Frances had pulled it into the 
ship. The two humans stood at 
the other side of the room, against 
the control panel, and watched 
it. 

"No features," said Roget, "unless you count those markings .on 
the surface. This thing isn't from 
anywhere in the Solar System, 
Frances— it isn't even any order 
of evolution we ever heard of." 

"I know," she said abstractedly. 
"Leo, is he wearing any protection against space that you can 
see?" 

"No," said Roget. "That's him, 
not a spacesuit. Look, you can see 
halfway into him. But — " 

Frances turned to look at him. 
"That's it," she said. "It means 
this is his natural element — 
space!" 

Roget looked thoughtfully at 
the egg. "It makes sense," he 
said. "He's adapted for it. anyhow — ovoid, for a high volumeto-surface ratio. Tough outer 
shell. Moves by jet propulsion.

It's hard to believe, because we've 
never run into a creature like him 
before, but I don't see why not. 
On Earth there are organisms, 
plants, that can live and reproduce in boiling water, and others 
that can stand near-zero temperatures." 

"He's a plant, too, you know," 
Frances put in. 

Roget stared at her, then back 
at the egg. "That color, you 
mean? Chlorophyl. It could be." 

"Must be," she corrected firmly. 
"How else would he live in a 
vacuum?" And then, distressedly, 
"Oh, what a smell!" 

They looked at each other. It 
had been something monumental 
in the way of smells, though it 
had only lasted a fraction of a 
second. There had been a series 
of separate odors, all unfamiliar 
and all overpoweringly strong. At 
least a dozen of them, Roget 
thought; they had gone past too 
quickly to count. 

"He did it before, outside, and 
I saw the vapor." He closed his 
helrnet abruptly and motioned 
McMenamin to do the same. She 
frowned and shook her head. He 
opened his helmet again. "It 
might be poisonous!" 

"I don't think so," said McMenamin. "Anyway, we've got to 
try something." She walked toward the green egg. It rolled away 
from | her, and she went "past it 
into the bedroom. 



In a minute she reappeared, 
carrying an armload of plastic 
boxes and bottles. She came back 
to Roget and knelt on the floor, 
lining up the containers with their 
nipples toward the egg. 

"What's this for?" Roget demanded. "Listen, we've got to figure some way of getting out of 
here. The ship's being eaten up — '* 

"Wait," said McMenamin. She 
reached down and squeezed three 
of the nipples quickly, one after 
the other. There was a tiny spray 
of face powder, then one of cologne (Nuit Juvienne), followed 
by a jet of good Scotch. 

Then she waited.. Roget was 
about to open his mouth when 
another blast of unfamiliar odors 
came from the egg. This time 
there were only three: two sweet 
ones and one sharp. 

■jlTcMENAMIN smiled. "I'm 
1TX going to name him Stinky," 
she said. She pressed the nipple* 
again, in a different order. Scotch, 
face powder, Nuit Juvienne. The 
egg replied: sharp, sweet, sweet. 

She gave him the remaining 
combination, and he echoed it; 
then she put a record cylinder on 
the floor and squirted the face 
powder. She added another cylinder and squeezed the cologne. She 
went along the line that way, releasing a smell for each cylinder 
until there were ten. The egg had 
responded, recognizably in some 



CABIN BOY 



Hi 



TP" 



cases, to each one. Then she took 
away seven of the cylinders and 
looked expectantly at the egg. 

The egg released a sharp odor. 

*'If ever we tell anybody," said 
Roge-t in an awed tone, "that you 
taught a six-foot Easter egg to 
count to ten by selected flatulence — " 

"Hush, fool," she said. "This is 
a tough one." 

She lined up three cylinders, 
waited for the sharp odor, then 
added six more to make three 
rows of three. The egg obliged 
with a penetrating smell which 
was a good imitation of citron 
extract, Frances* number nine. He 
followed it immediately with another of his own rapid, complicated series of smells. 

"He gets it," said McMenamin. 
"I think he just told us that three 
times three are nine." She stood 
up. "You go out first, Leo. I'll 
put htm out after you and then 
follow. There's something more 
we've got to show him before we 
let him go." 

Roget followed orders. When 
the egg came out and kept on 
going, he stepped in its path and 
held it back. Then he moved 
away, hoping the thing would 
get the idea that they weren't 
trying to force it, but wanted it 
to stay. The egg wobbled indecisively for a moment, and then 
stayed where it was. Frances came 



out the next minute, carrying one 
of the plastic boxes and a portable 
flashlight. 

"My nicest powder," she said 
regretfully, "but it was the only 
thing I could find enough of." 
She clapped her gloved hands together sharply, with the box between them. It burst, and a haze 
of particles spread around them, 
glowing faintly in the sunlight. 

The egg was still waiting, somehow giving the impression that it 
was watching them alertly. McMenamin flicked on the flashlight 
and pointed it at Roget. It made 
a clear, narrow path in the haze 
of dispersed particles. Then she 
turned it on herself, on the ship, 
and finally upward, toward the 
tiny blue disk that was Earth. 
She did it twice more, then stepped back toward the airlock, and 
Roget followed her. 

They stood watching as Tommy scurried off across the hull, 
squeezed himself into it and disappeared. 

*'That was impressive," Roget 
said. "But I wonder just how 
much good it's going to do us." ' 

"He knows we're alive, intelligent, friendly, and that we come 
from Earth," said McMenamin 
thoughtfully. "Or, anyhow, we 

did our best to tell him. That's 
all we can do. Maybe he won't 
want to help us; maybe he can't. 
But it's up to him now." 



ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in 

HpHE mental state of Tommy, 
as he dived through the hull 
of the ship and into the nearest 
radial corridor, would be difficult to describe fully to any human being. He was the equivalent 
of a very small boy — that approximation still holds good — and 
he had the obvious reactions to 
novelty and adventure. But there 
was a good deal more. He had 
seen living, intelligent beings of 
an unfamiliar shape and substance, who lived in metal and 
had some connection with one of 
those enormous, enigmatic ships 
called planets, which no captain 
of his own race dared approach. 

And yet Tommy knew, with all 
the weight of knowledge accumulated, codified and transmitted 
over a span measured in billions 
of years, that there was no other 
intelligent race than his own in 
the entire universe, that metal, 
though life-giving, could not itself be alive, and that no living 
creature, having the ill luck to be 
spawned aboard a planet, could 
ever hope to escape so tremendous 
a gravitational field. 

The final result of all this was 
that Tommy desperately wanted 
to go somewhere by himself and 
think. But he couldn't; he had to 
keep moving, i n time with the 
scanning waves along the corridor, and he had to give ell his 



mental energy to the problem of 
slipping past the search party. 

The question was — how long 
had he been gone? If they had 
reached the hull while he was inside the metal thing, they might 
have looked for him outside and 
concluded that he had somehow 
slipped past them, back to the 
center of the ship. In that case, 
they would probably be working 
their way back, and he had only 
to follow them to the axis and 
hide in a chamber as soon as they 
left it. But if they were still working outward, his chances of escape 
were almost nil. And now it 
seemed more important to escape 
than it had before. 

There was one possibility which 
Tommy, who, in most circumstances, would try anything, 
hated to think about. Fuel lines 
— tubes carrying the rushing, radiant ion vapor that powered the 
ship — adjoined many of these 
corridors, and it was certain that 
if he dared to enter one, he would 
be perfectly safe from detection 
as long as he remained in it. But, 
for one thing, these lines radiated 
from the ship's axis and none of 
them would take him where he 
wanted to go. For another, they 
were the most dangerous place 
aboard ship. Older crew members 
sometimes entered them to make 
emergency repairs, but they got 
out as quickly as they could. 
Tommy did not know how long 



CABIN BOY 



125 



he could survive there; he had an 
unpleasant conviction that it 
would not be long. 

Only a few yards up the corridor was the sealed sphincter 
which gave entrance to such a 
tube. Tommy looked at it indecisively as the motion of the 
scanning waves brought him nearer. He had still not made up his 
mind when he caught a flicker 
reflected around the curve of the 
corridor behind him. 

Tommy squeezed himself closer 
to the wall and watched the other 
end of the corridor approach with 
agonizing slowness. If he could 
only get around that corner — 

The flicker of motion was repeated, and then he saw a thin 
rind of green poke into view. 
There was no more time to consider entering the fuel line, no 
time to let the scanning waves' 
movement carry him around the 
corner. Tommy put on full speed, 
cutting across the next wave and 
down the cross -corridor ahead. 

Instantly the Captain's voice 
shouted from the wall : "Ah! Was 
that him, the dirty scut? After 
him, lads!"" 

Tommy glanced behind as he 
turned another corner, and his 
heart sank. It was no cabin boy 
who was behind him, or even an 
Ordinary, but a Third Mate — so 
huge that he filled nearly half the 
width of the corridor, and so powerful that Tommy, in comparison. 



was like a boy on a bicycle racing 
an express train. 

He turned another corner, realizing in that instant that he was 
as good as caught : the new corridor ahead of him stretched 
straight and without a break for 
three hundred yards. As he 
flashed down it, the hulk of the 
Mate appeared around the bend 
behind. The Captain's voice bellowed, "Get the little essence of 
putrescence !" 

The Mate was coming up with 
terrifying speed, and Tommy had 
time for only one last desperate 
spurt. Then the other body slammed with stunning force against 
his, and he was held fast. 

As they coasted to a halt, the 
Captain's voice rumbled from the 
wall; "That's it, Mister. Hold him 
where I can see him!" 

The scanning areas were stationary now. The Mate moved 
Tommy forward until he was 
squarely in range of the nearest. 

Tommy squirmed futilely. The 
Captain said, "There's our little 
jokester. It's a pure pleasure to 
see you again, Tommy. What — 
no witty remarks? Your humor 
all dried up?" 

Tommy gasped, "Hope you enjoyed your nap, Captain." 

'Very good," said the Captain 
with heavy sarcasm. "Oh, very 
entertaining, Tommy. Now would 
you have anything more to say, 

before I put the whips to you?" 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Tommy was silent. 

The Captain said to the Mate, 
"Nice work, Mister. You'll get 
extra rations for this." 

The Mate spoke for the first 
time, and Tommy recognized his 
high, affected voice. It was George 
Adkins — to choose a name only 
for identification purposes— who 
had recently spored and was so 
proud of the new life inside his 
body that there was no living 
with him. George said prissily, 
"Thank you, sir, I'm sure. Of 
course, I really shouldn't have 
exerted myself the way I just did, 
in my state." 

"Well, you'll be compensated 
for it," the Captain said testily. 
"Now take the humorist down to 
Assembly Five. We'll have a little 
ceremony there." 

"Yes, sir," said the Mate distantly. He moved off, shoving 
Tommy ahead of him, and dived 
into the first turning that led 
downward. 

They moved along in silence 
for the better part of a mile, crossing from one lesser passage to 
another until they reached a main 
artery that led directly to the 
center of the ship. The scanning 
waves were still stationary, and 
they were moving so swiftly that 
there was no danger of being 
overheard. Tommy said politely, 
"You won't let them be too hard 
on me, will you, sir?" 

The Mate did not reply for a 



moment. He had been baited byTommy's mock courtesy before, 
and he was as wary as his limited 
intelli gence allowed. Finally he 
said, "You'll get no more than 
what's coming to you, young 
Tom." 

"Yes, sir. I know that, sir. I'm 
sorry I made you exert yourself, 
sir, in your condition and all." 

"You should be," said the Mate 
stiffly, but his voice betrayed his 
pleasure. It was seldom enough 
that even a cabin boy showed a 
decent interest in the Mate's prospective parenthood. "They're 
moving about, you know," he 
added, unbending a little. 

"Are they, sir? Oh, you must 
be careful of yourself, sir. How 
many are there, please, sir?" 

"Twenty-eight," said the Mate, 
as he had on every possible occasion for the past two weeks. 
"Strong and healthy — so far." 

"That's remarkable, sir!" cried 
Tommy. "Twenty-eight 1 If I 
might be so bold, sir, you ought 
to be careful of what you eat. Is 
the Captain going to give you 
your extra rations out of that 
mass he just brought in topside, 
sir?" 

"I'm sure / don't know." 

"Gosh!" exclaimed Tommy. "I 
wish I could be sure — " 

He let the pause grow. Finally, 
the Mate said querulously, "What; 
do you mean? Is there anything 
wrong with the metal?" 



CABIN BOY 



n? 



•'I don't really know. sir. but 
it isn't like any we ever had before. That is," Tommy added, 
"since I was spored, sir." 

"Naturally," said the Mate. 
"I've eaten all kinds myself, you 
know." 

"Yes, sir. But doesn't it usually 
come in ragged shapes, sir, and 
darkish?" 

"Of course it does. Everybody 
knows that. Metal is non-living, 
and only living things have regular shapes." 

"Yes, sir. But I was topside, 
sir, while I was trying to get 
away, and I saw this metal. It's 
quite regular, except for some 
knobs at one end, sir, and it's as 
smooth as you are. sir, and shiny. 
If you'll forgive me, sir, it didn't 
look at all appetizing to me.** 

"Nonsense," said the Mate uncertainly. "Nonsense," he repeated, in a stronger tone. "You 
must have been mistaken. Metal 
can't be alive." 

"That's just what I thought, 
sir," said Tommy excitedly. "But 
there are live things in this metal, 
sir. I saw them. And the metal 
wasn't just floating along the way 
it's supposed to, sir. I saw it when 
the Captain brought it down, and 
. . . But I'm afraid you'll think 
I'm lying, sir, if I tell you what 
" it was doing." 

"Well, what was it doing?" 

"I swear I saw it, sir," Tommy 
went on. "The Captain will tell 



you the same thing, sir, if you 
ask him — he must have noticed." 

"Sterilize it all, what was it 
doing?" 

Tommy lowered his voice. 
"There was an ion trail shooting 
from it, sir. It was trying to get 
away !" 

While the Mate was trying to 
absorb that, they reached the bottom of the corridor and entered 
the vast globular space of Assembly Five, lined with crewmen 
waiting to witness the punishment 
of Tommy Loy. 

This was not going to be any 
fun at all. thought Tommy, but 
at least he had paid back the 
Third Mate in full measure. The 
Mate, for the moment, at any 
rate, was not taking any joy in 
his promised extra rations. 

WHEN it was over, Tommy 
huddled in a corner of the 
crew compartment where they 
had tossed him, bruised and 
smarting in every nerve, shaken 
by the beating he had undergone. 
The pain was still rolling through 
him in faint, uncontrollable 
waves, and he winced at each one, 
in spite of himself, as though it 
were the original blow. 

In the back of his mind, the 
puzzle of the metal ship was still 
calling, but the other experience 
was too fresh, the remembered 
images too vivid. 

The Captain had begun, as al


1*1 




 



ways, by reciting the Creed. 

In the beginning was the Spore, 
end the Spore was lone. 

(And the crew: Praised be the 
Spore!) 

Next there was light, and the 
light was good. Yea, good for the 
Spore and the Spore's First Children. 

{Praised be they!) 

But the light grew evil in the 
days of the Spore's Second Children. 

{Woe unto them!) 

And the light cast them out. 
Yea, exiled were they, into the 
darkness and the Great Deep. 

{Pity for the outcasts in the 
Great Deep!) 

Tommy had mumbled his response with the rest of them, 
thinking rebellious thoughts. 
There was nothing evil about 
light; they lived by it still. What 
must have happened — the Captain himself admitted as much 
when he taught history and natural science classes — was that the 
earliest ancestors of the race, 
spawned in the flaming heart of 
the Galaxy, had grown too efficient for their own good. 

They had specialized, more and 
more, in extracting energy from 
starlight and the random metal 
and other elements- they encountered in space; and at last they 
absorbed, willy-nilly, more than 
they could use. So they had 
moved, gradually and naturally. 



over many generations, out from 
that intensely radiating region 
into the "Great Deep" — the universe of thinly scattered stars. 
And the process had continued, 
inevitably; as the level of available energy fell, their absorption 
of it grew more and more efficient. 

Now, not only could they never 
return to their birthplace, but 
they could not even approach a 
single sun as closely as some 
planets did. Therefore the planets, and the stars themselves, were 
objects of fear. That was natural 
and sensible. But why did they 
have to continue this silly ritual, 
invented by some half-evolved, 
superstitious ancestor, of "outcasts" and "evil?" 

The Captain finished : 

Save us from the Death that 
lies in the Great Deep , . , 

{The creeping Death that lies 
in the Great Deep!) 

And keep our minds pure . . . 

{As pure as the light in the daya 
of the Spore, blessed be He!) 

And our course straight ... 

{As straight as the light, 
brothers!) 

That we may meet our lost 
brothers again in the Day of Reuniting. 

{Speed that day!) 

Then the pause, the silence that 
grew until it was like the silence 
of space. At last the Captain 
spoke again, pronouncing judgment against Tommy, ending: ^ 



CABIN BOY 



"Let him be whipped!" 

Tommy tensed himself, thickening his skin, drawing his body 
into the smallest possible compass. Two husky Ordinaries 
seized him and tossed him at a 
third. As Tommy floated across 
the room, the crewman pressed 
himself tightly against the wall, 
drawing power from it until he 
could contain no more. And as 
Tommy neared him, he discharged it in a crackling arc that 
filled Tommy's body with the 
pure essence of pain, and sent him 
hurtling across the chamber to 
the next shock — and the next — 
and the next — 

Until the Captain boomed, 
"Enough!" and they had carried 
him out and left him here atone. 

HE heard the voices of crewmen as they drew their rations. One of them was grumbling about the taste, and another, sounding happily bloated, 
was telling him to shut up and 
eat, that metal was metal. 

That would be the new metal, 
however much of it had been absorbed by now, mingled with the 
old in the reservoir. Tommy wondered briefly how much of it there 
was, and whether the alien ship — 
if it was a ship — could repair even 
a little damage to itself. But that 
assumed life in the metal, and in 
spite of what he had seen. Tommy 
couldn't believe in it. It seemed 



beyond question, though, that 
there were living things inside 
the metal; and when the metal 
was gone, how would they live? 

Tommy imagined himself set 
adrift from the ship, alone in 
space, radiating more heat than 
his tiny volume could absorb. He 
shuddered. 

He thought again of the problem that had obsessed him ever 
since he had seen the alien, fivepointed creatures in the metal 
ship. Intelligent life-was supposed 
to be sacred. That was part of 
the Creed, and it was stated in a 
sloppy, poetic way like the rest 
of tt. but it made a certain kind 
of sense. No crewman or Captain 
had the right to destroy another 
for his benefit, because the same 
heredity was in them all. They 
were all potentially the same, 
none better than another. 

And you ate metal, because 
metal was non-living and certainly not intelligent. But if that stopped being true. . . ? 

Tommy felt he was missing 
something. Then he had it: In 
the alien ship, trying to talk to 
the creatures that lived in metal, 
he had been scared almost scentless — but underneath the fright 
and the excitement, he had felt 
wonderful. It had been, he realized suddenly, like the mystic 
completion that was supposed to 
come when all the straight lines 
met, in the "Day of Reuniting" — 



110 




 



when all the far-flung ships, 
parted for all the billions of years 
tif their flight, came together at 
last. It was talking to someone 
different from yourself. 

He wanted to talk again to the 
aliens, teach them to form their 
uncouth sounds into words, learn 
from them . . . Vague images 
swirled in his mind. They were 
products of an utterly different 
line of evolution. Who knew what 
they might be able to teach him? 

And now the dilemma took 
shape. If his own ship absorbed 
the metal of theirs, they would 
die; therefore he would have to 
make the Captain let them go. 
But if he somehow managed to set 
thein free, they would leave and 
he would never see them again. 

A petty officer looked into the 
cubicle and said, "All right, Loy, 
out of it. You're on garbage detail. You eat after you work, if 
there's anything left. Lively, 
now !" 

Tommy moved thoughtfully out 
into the corridor, his pain almost 
forgotten. The philosophical 
problems presented by the alien 
ship, too, having no apparent solution, were receding from his 
mind. A new thought was taking 
their place, one that made him 
glow inside with the pure rapture of the devoted practical 
jok ester. * 

The whipping he was certainly 
going to get — and, so soon after 



the last offense, it would be * 
beauty — scarcely entered his 
mind. 

ROGET climbed in. opening 
his helmet, and sat down warily in the acceleration couch. He 
didn't look at the woman. 

McMenamin said quietly, 
"Bad?" 

"Not good. The outer skin's 
gone all across that area, and it's 
eating into the lead sheathing. 
The tubes are holding up pretty 
well, but they'll be next." 

"We've done as much as we 
can, by rolling the ship around?" 

"Just about. I'll keep at it, but 
I don't see how it can be more 
than a few hours before the tubes 
go. Then we're cooked, whatever 
your fragrant little friend does." 

He stood up abruptly and 
climbed over the slanting wall 
which was now their floor, to pc«r 
out the direct-view port. He 
swore, slowly and bitterly. "You 
try the radio again while I was 
out?" he asked. 

"Yes." She did not bother to 
add that there had been no response. Here, almost halfway between the orbits of Earth and 
Mars, they were hopelessly out 
of touch. A ship as small as theirs 
couldn't carry equipment enough 
to bridge the distance. 

Roget turned around, said, "By 



CABIN BOY 



131 



God — " And then clenched his 
jaw and strode out of the room. 
McMenamin heard htm walk 
through the bedroom and clatter 
around in the storage compartment behind. 

In a few moments he was back 
with a welding torch in his hand. 
"Should have thought of this before," he said. "I don't know 
what'll happen if I cut into that 
hull — damn thing may explode, 
for all I know — but it's better 
than sitting doing nothing." He 
put his helmet down with a bang 
and his voice came tinnily in her 
helmet receiver. "Be back in a 
minute." 

"Be careful," McMenamin said 
again. 

Roget closed the outer lock 
door behind him and looked at 
the ravished hull of the ship. The 
metal had been eaten away in a 
broad band all around the ship, 
just above the tail, as if a child 
had bitten around the small end 
of a pear. In places the clustered 
rocket tubes showed through like 
gnawed bones. He felt a renewed 
surge of anger, with fear deep 
under it. 

A hundred years ago, he reminded himself, the earliest space 
voyagers had encountered situations as bad as this one, maybe 
worse. But Roget was a city man, 
bred for city virtues. He didn't, he 
decided, know quite how to feel 
or act. What were you supposed 



to do when you were about to die, 
fifteen million miles from home? 
Try to calm McMenamin — who 
was dangerously calm already — 
or show your true nobility by 
making one of those death-bed 
speeches you read in the popular 
histories? What about suggesting 
a little suicide pact? There was 
nothing in the ship that would 
give them a cleaner death than 
the one ahead of them. About all 
he could do would be to stab 
Frances, then himself, with a 
screwdriver. 

Her voice said in the earphones, 
"You all right?" 

He said, "Sure. Just going to 
try it." He lowered himself to the 
green surface, careful not to let 
his knees touch the dark, corrosive area. The torch was a 
small, easily manageable tool. He 
pointed the snout at the dark area 
where it lapped up over the hull, 
turned the switch on and pressed 
the button. Flame leaped out, 
washing over the dark surface. 
Roget felt the heat through his 
suit. He turned off the torch to 
see what effect it had had. 

There was a deep, charred pit 
in the dark stuff, and it seemed 
to him that it had pulled back a 
little from the area it was attacking. It was more than he had expected. Encouraged, he tried 
again. 

There was a sudden tremor under him and he leaped nervously 




 



to his feet, just in time to avoid 
the corrosive wave as it rolled 
under him. For a moment he was 
only conscious of the thick metal 
of his boot soles and the thinness 
of the fabric that covered his 
knees; then, as he was about to 
step back out of the way, he 
realized that it was not only the 
dark ring that had expanded, that 
was still expanding. 

He moved jerkily — too late — as 
the pule center area swept toward 
and under him. Then he felt as 
if he had been struck by a mighty 
hammer. 

His ears rang, and there was a 
mist in front uf his eyes. He 
blinked, tried to raise an arm. It 
seemed to be stuck fast at the 
WflSl arid elbow. Panicked, he 
tried to push himself away and 
couldn't. As his vision cleared, he 
saw that he was spread-eagled on 
the pale disk that had spread out 
under him. The, metal collars of 
his wrist and elbow joints, all the 
metal parts of his suit, were held 
immovably. The torch lay a few 
inches away from his right hand. 

For a few moments, incredulously. Roget still tried to move. 
Then he stopped and lay in the 
prison of his suit, looking at the 
greenish-cream surface under his 
helmet. 

Frances* voice said abruptly, 
"Leo. is anything wrong?" 

Roget felt an instant relief that 
left him shaken and weak. His 



forehead was cold. He said after 
a moment, "Pulled a damn fool 
trick, Frances. Come out and help 
mc if you can." 

He heard a click as her helmet 
went down. He added anxiously, 
"But don't come near the pale 
part, or you'll get caught too." 

After a while she said, "Darling, I can't think of anything to 
do.'* 

Roget was feeling calmer, somehow not much afraid any more. 
He wondered how much oxygen 
was left in his suit. Not more than 
an hour, he thought. He said, "I 
know. I can't, either." 

Later he called, "Frances?" 

"Yes?" 

"Roll the ship once in a while, 
will you? Might get through to 
the wiring or something, otherwise." 

. . All right." 

After that, they didn't talk. 
There was a great deal to be said, 
but it was too late to say it. 

V 

"TOMMY was on garbage detail 
* with nine other unfortunates. 
It was a messy, hard, unpleasant 
business, fit only for a cabin boy 
— collecting waste from the compartment and corridor receptacles 
and pressing it into standard capsule-shapes, then hauling it to 
the nearest polarizer. But Tommy, under the suspicious eye of 



CABIN BOY 



the petty officer in charge, worked 
with an apparent total absorption 
until they had cleaned out their 
section of the six inmost levels 
and were well into the seventh. 

This was the best strategic 
place for Tommy's departure, 
since it was about midway from 
axis to hull, and the field of operations of any pursuit was correspondingly broadened. Also, the 
volume in which they labored had 
expanded wedgewise as they 
climbed, and the petty officer, 
though still determined to watch 
Tommy, could no longer keep 
him constantly in view. 

Tommy saw the officer disappear around the curve of the corridor, and kept on working busily. 
He was still at it, with every appearance of innocence and industry, when the officer abruptly 
popped into sight again about 
three seconds later. 

The officer stared at him with 
baffled disapproval and said unreasonably, "Come on, come on, 
Loy. Don't slack." 

"Right," said Tommy, and 
Scurried faster. 

A moment later Third Mate 
Ad kins hove majestically into 
View. The petty officer turned respectfully to face him. 

"Keeping young Tom well occupied, I see," said the Mate. 
? "Yes, sir," . said the officer. "Appears to be a reformed character, 
now, sir. Must have learned a 



lesson, one way or another." 

"Ha!" said the Mate. . "Very 
good. Oh, Loy, you might be interested in this — the Captain himself has told me that the new 
metal is perfectly all right. Unusually rich, in fact. I've had my 
first ration already — very good it 
was, too — and I'm going to get 
my extras in half an hour or so. 
Well, good appetite, all." And, 
while the lesser crewmen clustered 
against the walls to give him 
room, he moved haughtily off 
down the corridor. 

Tommy kept on working as 
fast as he could. He was draining 
energy he might need later, but it 
was necessary to quiet the petty 
officer's suspicions entirely, in order to give himself a decent start. 
In addition, his artist's soul demanded it. Tommy, in his own 
way, was a perfectionist. 

Third Mate Adkins was due to 
get his extras in about half an 
hour, and if Tommy knew the 
Captain's habits, the Captain 
would be taking his first meal 
from the newly replenished reservoir at about the same time. That 
set the deadline. Before the half 
hour was up, Tommy would have 
to cut off the flow of the new 
metal, so that stomachs which 
had been gurgling in anticipation 
would remain desolately void until the next windfall. 

The Mate, in spite of his hypochondria, was a glutton. With any 



131 




 



luck, this would make him bitter 
for a month. And the Old Man — 
but it was better not to dwell on 
that. 

The petty officer hung around 
irresolutely for another ten minutes, then dashed oFf down the 
corridor to attend to the rest of 
his detail. Without wasting a moment. Tommy dropped the capsule he had just collected a«d shot 
away in the other direction. 

The rest of the cabin boys, as 
fearful of Tommy as they were 
of constituted authority, would 
not dare to raise an outcry until 
they spotted the officer coming 
back. The officer, because of the 
time he had wasted in watching 
Tommy, would have to administer a thorough lecture on slackness to the rest of the detail before he returned. 

Tommy had calculated his 
probable margin to a nicety, and 
it was enough, barring accidents, 
to get him safely away. Nevertheless, he turned and twisted from 
one system of corridors to another, carefully confusing his trail 
before he set himself to put as 
much vertical distance behind 
him as he could. 

This part of the game had to 
be accomplished in a fury of action, for he was free to move in 
the corridors only until the Captain was informed that he was 
loose again. After that, he had to 
play hounds and hares with the 



moving strips through which the 
Captain could see him. 

When the time he had estimated was three-quarters gone, 
Tommy r slowed and came to a 
halt. He inspected the corridor 
wall minutely, and found the almost imperceptible trace that 
showed where the scanning wave 
nearest him had stopped. He jockeyed his body clear of it, and then 
waited. He still had a good distance to cover before he dared 
play his trump, but it was not 
safe to move now; he had to wait 
for the Captain's move. 

It came soon enough: the scanning waves erupted into simultaneous motion and anger. "Tommy!" they bellowed. "Tommy 
Loy ! Come back, you unmentionable excrescence, or by Spore 
you*ll regret it! Tommy!" 

Moving between 'waves, Tommy waited patiently until their 
motion carried him from one corridor to another. The Captain's 
control over the waves was not 
complete: in some corridors they 
moved two steps upward for one 
down, in others the reverse. When 
he got into a downward corridor. 
Tommy scrambled out of it again 
as soon as he could and started 
over. 

Gradually, with many false 
starts, he worked his way up to 
the thirteenth level, one level 
short of the hull. 

Now came the hard part. This 



CABIN BOY 



time he had to enter the fuel lines, 
not only for sure escape, but to 
gather the force he needed. And 
for the first time in his life. Tommy hesitated before something 
that he had set himself to do. 

Death was a phenomenon that 
normally touched each member 
of Tommy's race only once — only 
Captains died, and they died 
alone. For lesser members of the 
crew, there was almost no mortal 
clanger; the ship protected them. 
But Tommy knew what death 
was, and as the sealed entrance to 
the fuel line swung into view, he 
knew that he faced it. 

He made himself small, as he 
had under the lash. He broke the 
seal. Quickly, before the following 
wave could catch him. he thrust 
himself through the sphincter. 

The blast of ions gripped him, 
flung him forward, hurting him 
like a hundred whips. Desperately he held himself together, thickening his insulating shell against 
that deadly flux of energy; but 
still his body absorbed it, till he 
felt a horrid fullness. 

The walls of the tube fled past 
him, barely perceptible in the 
rush of glowing haze. Tommy 
held in that growing tautness with 
his last strength, meanwhile looking for an exit. He neither knew 
nor cared whether he had reached 
his goal ; he had to get out or die. 

He saw a dim oval on the wall 
ahead, hurled himself at it, clung, 




 



and forced his body through. 

He was in a horizontal corridor, 
just under the hull. He drank the 
Messed coolness of it for an instant, before moving to the nearest sphincter. Then he was out, 
under the velvet-black sky and 
the diamond blaze of stars. 

He looked around. The pain 
was fading now; he felt only an 
atrocious bloatedness that tightened Ins skin and made all his 
movements halting. Forward of 
him, up the long shallow curve 
of the hull, he could see the alien 
ship, and the two five-pointed 
creatures beside it. Carefully, 
keeping a few feet between himself and the hull, he headed toward it. 

One of the creatures was 
sprawled flat on the polarizer that 
had brought its ship down. The 
other, standing beside it, turned 
as Tommy came near, and two of 
its upper three points moved in 
an insane fashion that made Tommy feel ill. He looked away quickly and moved past them, till he 
was directly over the center of 
the polarizer and only a few 
inches away. 

Then, with a sob of relief, he 
released the energy his body had 
Stored; In one thick, white bolt, 
it sparked to the polarizer's center. 

Shaken and spent, Tommy 
floated upward and surveyed 
what he had done. The muzzle

of the polarizer was contracting, 
puckering at the center, the dark 
corrosive ring following it in. So 
much energy, applied in one jolt, 
must have shorted and paralyzed 
it all the way back to the ship's 
nerve center. The Captain, Tommy thought wryly, would be 
jumping now! 

And he wasn't done yet. Tommy took one last look at the aliens 
and their ship. The sprawled one 
was up now, and the two of them 
had their upper points twined 
around each other in a nauseating 
fashion. Then they parted suddenly, and, facing Tommy, wiggled their free points. Tommy 
moved purposefully off across the 
width of the ship, heading for the 
three heavy-duty polarizers. 

He had to go in again through 
that hell not once more, but 
twice. Though his nerves shrank 
from the necessity, there was no 
way of avoiding it. For the ship 
could not alter its course, except 
by allowing itself to be attracted 
by a sun or other large body — 
which was unthinkable • — or it 
could rotate at the Captain's will. 
The aliens were free now, but the 
Captain had only to spin ship in 
ordeT to snare them again. 

Four miles away, Tommy 
found the second polarizer. He 
backed away a carefully calculated distance before he re-entered the hull. At least he could 
know in advance how far he had 

m 



to go — and he knew now, too, 
that the energy he had stored the 
first time had been adequate twice 
over. He rested a few moments; 
then, like a diver plunging into a 
torrent, he thrust himself into the 
fuel line. 

He came out again, shuddering 
with pain, and pushed himself 
through the exit. He felt as bloated as he had before. The charge 
of energy was not as great, but 
Tommy knew that he was weakening. This time, when he discharged over the polarizer and 
watched it contract into a tiny, 
puckered mass, he felt as if he 
could never move again, let alone 
expose himself once more to that 
tunnel of flame. 

The stars, he realized dully, 
were moving in slow, ponderous 
arcs over his head. The Captain 
was spinning ship. Tommy sank 
to the hull and lay motionless, 
watching half -attentively for a 
sight of the alien ship. 

There it was, a bright dot haloed by the flame of its exhaust. 
It swung around slowly, gradually, with the rest of the firmament, growing smaller slowly. 

"He'll get them before they're 
out of range," Tommy thought. 
He watched as the bright dot 
climbed overhead, began to fall 
on the other side. 

The Captain had one polarizer 
left. It would be enough. 

Wearily Tommy rose and fol

lowed the bright star. It was not 
a joke any longer. He would willingly have gone inside to the 
bright, warm, familiar corridors 
that led downward to safety and 
deserved punishment. But somehow he could not bear to think of 
those fascinating creatures — those 
wonderful playthings — going to 
fill the Captain's fat belly. 

Tommy followed the ship until 
he could see the pale gleam of the 
functioning polarizer. Then he 
crawled through the hull once 
more, and again he found a sealed 
entrance to the fuel tube. He did 
not let himself think about it. His 
mind was numb already, and he 
pushed himself through uncaring, 
as condemned criminals often go 
carelessly to execution. 

This time it was worse than 
ever before; he had not dreamed 
that it could be so bad. His vi T 
sion dimmed and he could barely 
see the exit, or feel its pressure, 
when he dragged himself out. 
Lurching drunkenly, he passed a 
scanning wave on his way to the 
hull sphincter, and heard the 
Captain's voice explode. 

Outside, ragged black patches 
obscured his vision of the stars. 
The pressure inside him pressed 
painfully outward, again and 
again, and each time he held it 
back. Then he felt rather than 
saw that he was over the pale 
disk, and as he let go the bolt he 
lost consciousness. 



When his vision cleared, the 
alien ship was still above him,, 
alarmingly close. The Captain 
must have had it almost reeled in 
again, he thought, when he had 
let go that last charge. 

Flaming, it receded into the 
Great Deep, and he watched it 
go until it shrank beyond his vision to follow. 

He felt a great peace and a 
great weariness. The tiny blue 
disk that was a planet had moved 
its apparent position a little near^er its star. The aliens were going 
back there, to their unimaginable 
home, and Tommy's ship was 
forging onward into new depths 
of darkness — toward the edge of 
the Galaxy and the greatest Deep. 

He moved to the nearest 
sphincter as the cold bit at him. 
His spirits lifted suddenly as he 
thought of those three stabs of 
energy, equally spaced around 
the twelve-mile perimeter of the 
ship. The Captain would be utterly speechless with rage, he 
thought, like an aged martinet 
who had had his hands painfully 
slapped by a small boy. 

For, as we warned you, the 
Captain was not precisely a cap-< 
tain, nor the ship precisely a ship. 
Ship and Captain were one and 
the same, hive and queen; , bee* 
castle and lord. 

In effect, Tommy had circumnavigated the skipper.
