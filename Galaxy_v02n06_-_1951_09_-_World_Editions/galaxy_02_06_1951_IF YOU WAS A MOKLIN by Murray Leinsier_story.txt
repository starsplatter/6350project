IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN by Murray Leinsier



Up to that very morning everything is serene, and that morning 
I am sitting on the trading post 
porch, not doing a thing but sitting there and breathing happy. 
I'm looki ng at a Moklin kid. 
She's about the size of. a human 
six-year-old and she is playing 
in a mud puddle while her folks 
are trading in the post. She is a 
cute kid — mighty human-looking. 
She has long whiskers like Old 
Man Bland, who's the first human to open a trading post and 
learn to talk to Moklins. 

Moklins think a lot of Old 
Man Bland. They build him a 
big tomb, Moklin-style, when he 
dies, and there is more Moklin 
kids born with long whiskers than 
you can shake a stick at. And 
everything looks okay. Everything! s 

Sitting there on the porch, I 
hear a Moklin talking inside the 
trade room. Talking English just 
as good as anybody. He says to 
Deeth, our Moklin trade-clerk, 
"But Deeth, I can buy this 
cheaper over at the other trading 
post! Why should I pay more 
here?" 

Deeth says, in English too, "I 
can't help that. That's the price 
here. You pay it or you don't. 
That's all." 

I just sit there breathing complacent, thinking how good things 



are. Here I'm Joe Brinkley, and 
me and Brooks are the Company 
on Moklin — only humans rate as 
Company employees and get pensions, of course — and I'm thinking sentimental about how much 
humaner Moklins are getting 
every day and how swell everything is. 

The six-year-old kid gets up 
out of the mud puddle, and 
wrings out her whiskers — they 
are exactly like the ones on the 
picture of Old Man Bland in the 
trade room — and she goes trotting off down the road after her 
folks. She is mighty human-looking, that one. 

The wild ones don't look near 
so human. Those that live in the 
forest are greenish, and have 
saucer eyes, and their noses can 
wiggle like an Earth rabbit. You 
wouldn't think they're the same 
breed as the trading post Moklins at all, but they are. They 
crossbreed with each other, only 
the kids look humaner than their 
parents and are mighty near the 
same skin color as Earth men, 
which is plenty natural when you 
think about it, but nobody does. 
Not up to then, 

I don't think about that then, 
or anything else. Not even about 
the reports Brooks keeps sweating over and sending off with 
every Company ship. I am just 
sitting there contented when I 
notice that Sally, the tree that 




 



shades the trading post porch. 
Starts pulling up her roots. She 
gets them coiled careful and 
starts marching off. I see the 
other trees are moving off, too, 
clearing the landing field. They're 
waddling away to leave a free 
space, and they're pushing and 
shoving, trying to crowd each 
other, and the little ones sneak 
under the big ones and they all 
act peevish. Somehow they know 
a ship is coming in. That's what 
their walking off means, anyhow. 
But there ain't a ship due in for 
a month, yet. 

They're clearing the landing 
field, though, so I start listening 
for a ship's drive, even if I don't 
believe it. At first I don't hear a 
thing. It must be ten minutes before I hear a thin whistle, and 
right after it the heavy drone 
that's the ground -repulsor units 
pushing against bedrock underground. Lucky they don't push 
on wet stuff, or a ship would sure 
mess up the local countryside! 

I get off my chair and go out 
to look. Sure enough, the old 
Palmyra comes bulging down out 
of the sky, a month ahead of 
schedule, and the trees over at 
the edge of the field shove each 
other all *round to make room. 
The ship drops, hangs anxious 
ten feet up, and then kind of sighs 
and lets down. Then there's Moklins running out of everywhere, 
Waving cordial. 



They sure do like humans, 
these Moklins! Humans are their \ 
idea of what people should be 
like! Moklins will wrestle the: 
freight over to the trading post 
while others are climbing over 
everything that's waiting to go' 
off. all set to pass it up to the 
ship and hoping to spot friends 
they've made in the crew. If they 
can get a human to go home with 
them and visit while the ship is 
down, they brag about it for 
weeks. And do they treat their 
guests swell! 

They got fancy Moklin clothes 
for them to wear ■ — soft, silky 
guest garments — and they got 
Moklin fruits and Moklin drinks 
— you ought to taste them! And 
when the humans have to go back 
to the* ship at takeoff time, the 
Moklins bring them back with 
flower wreaths all over them. 

Humans is tops on Moklin. 
And Moklins get humaner every 
day. There's Deeth, our clerk. 
You couldn't hardly tell him 
from .human, anyways. He looks 
like a human named Casey that 
used to be at the trading post, 
and he's got a flock of brothers 
and sisters as human-looking as 
he is. You'd swear — 

But this is the last time but 
one that a Harth ship is going to 
land on Moklin, though nobody 
knows it yet. Her passenger port 
opens up and Captain Haney 
gets out. The Moklins yell cheer- : 



IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN

ful when they see him. He waves 
a hand and helps a human girl 
out. She has red hair and a sort 
of businesslike air about her. The 
Moklins wave and holler and 
grin. The girl looks at them funny, and Cap Haney explains 
something, but she sets her hps. 
Then the Moklins run out a 
freight -truck, and Haney and the 
girl get on it, and they come 
racing over to the post, the Moklins pushing and pulling them 
and making a big fuss of laughing and hollering — all so friendly, 
it would make anybody feel good 
inside. Moklins like humans! 
They admire them tremendous! 
They do everything they can 
think of to be human, and they're 
smart, but sometimes I get- cold 
shivers when I think how close a 
thing it turns out to be. 

Cap Haney steps off the 
freight-truck and helps the girl 
down. Her eyes are blazing. She 
is the maddest-looking female I 
ever see, but pretty as they make 
them, with that red hair " and 
those blue eyes staring at me hostile. 

"Hiya, Joe," says Cap Haney. 
"Where's Brooks?" 
. I tell him. Brooks is poking 
©round in the mountains up back 
of the post. He is jumpy and 
worried and peevish, and he acts 
like he's trying to find something 
that ain't there, but he's bound 
he's going to find it regardless. 



"Too bad he's not here," says 
Haney. He turns to the girl. "This 
is Joe Brinkley," he says. "He's 
Brooks' assistant. And, Joe, this 
is Inspector Caldwell — Miss 
Caldwell." 

"Inspector will do," says the 
girl, cuVt. She looks at me accusing. "I'm here to check into this 
matter of a competitive trading 
post on Moklin." 

."Oh," I says. "That's bad busi-, 
ness. But it ain't cut into our 
trade much. In fact, I don't think 
it's cut our trade at all." 

"Get my baggage ashore, Captain," says Inspector Caldwell, 
imperious. "Then you can go 
about your business. I '11 stay 
here until you stop on your return trip." 

I call, "Hey, Deeth!" But he's 
right behind me. He looks respectful and admiring at the girl. 
You'd swear he's human! He's 
the spit and image of Casey, who 
used to be on Moklin until six 
years back. 

"Yes, sir," says Deeth. He says 
to the girl, "Yes, ma'am. I'll show 
you your quarters, ma'arn, and 
your baggage will get there right 
away. This way, ma'am." 

He leads her off, but he don't 
have to send for her baggage. A 
pack of Moklins come along, 
dragging it, hopeful of having her 
say "Thank you" to them for it. 
There hasn't ever been a human 
woman on Moklin before, and 




 



they arc all excited- I bet if there 
had been women around before, 
there'd have been hell loose before, too. But now the Moklins 
just hang around, admiring. 

There are kids with whiskers 
like Old Man Bland, and other 
kids with mustaches — male and 
female both — and all that sort of 
stuff. I'm pointing out to Cap 
Haney some kids that bear a remarkable resemblance to him and 
he's saying, "Well, what do you 
know!" when Inspector Caldwell 
comes back. 

"What are you waiting for, 
Captain?" she asks, frosty. 

"The ship usually grounds a 
few hours," I explain. "These 
Moklins are such friendly critters, we figure it makes good wi'l 
for the trading post for the crew 
to be friendly with 'em." 

"I doubt," says Inspector Caldwell, her voice dripping icicles, 
"that I shall advise that that custom be continued." 

Cap Haney shrugs his shoulders and. goes off, so I know Inspector Caldwell is high up in 
the Company. She ain't old, maybe in her middle twenties, I'd say, 
but the Caldwell family practically owns the Company, and all 
the nephews and cousins and so 
on get put into a special school so 
they can go to work in the family 
firm. They get taught pretty 
good, and most of them really 
rate the good jobs they get. Any


how, there's plenty of good jobs* 
The Company runs twenty of 
thirty solar systems and it's run 
pretty tight. Being a Caldwell 
means you get breaks, but you 
got to live up to them. 

Cap Haney almost has to fight 
his way through the Moklins who 
want to give him flowers and 
fruits and such. Moklins are sure 
crazy about humans! He gets to 
the entry port and goes in, and 
the door closes and the Moklins 
pull back. Then the Palmyra 
booms. The ground-repulsor unit 
is on. She heaves up, like she ia 
grunting, and goes bulging up 
into the air, and the humming 
gets deeper and deeper, and fainter and fainter — and suddenly 
there's a keen whistling and she'9 
gone. It's all very normal. Nobody would guess that this is the 
last time but one a Earth ship 
will ever lift off Moklin! 

Inspector Caldwell taps her 
foot, icy. ''When will you send for 
Mr. Brooks?" she demands. 

"Right away," I says to her. 
"Deeth — " 

"I sent a runner for him, 
ma'am," says Deeth. "If he was 
in hearing of the ship's landing, 
he may be on the way here now." 

He bows and goes in the trade 
room. There are Moklins that 
came to see the ship land, and 
now have tramped over to do 
some trading. Inspector Caldwell 
jumps. 



IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN 



"Wh-what's that?" she asks, , 
tense. 

The trees that crowded off the 
field to make room for the Patmyra are waddling back. I realize 
for the first time that it might 
look funny to somebody just 
landed on Moklin. They are regular-looking trees, in a way. They 
got bark and branches and so on. 
Only they can put their roots 
down into holes they make in the 
ground, and that's the way they 
stay, mostly. But they can move. 
Wild ones, when there's a water 
shortage or they get too crowded 
or mad with each other, they pull 
up their roots and go waddling 
around looking for a better place 
to take root in. 

The trees on our landing field 
have learned that every so often 
a ship xs going to land and they've 
got to make room for it. But now 
the ship is gone, and they're 
lurching back to their places. The 
younger ones are waddling faster 
than the big ones, though, and 
taking the best places, and the old 
grunting trees are waving their 
branches indignant and puffing 
after them mad as hell. 

I explain what is happening. 
Inspector Caldwell just stares. 
Then Sally comes lumbering up. 
I got a friendly feeling for Sally. 
She's pretty old — her trunk is all 
of three feet thick— but she always puts out a branch to shade 
my window in the morning, and 




*3 




 



I never let any other tree take 
her place. She conies groaning 
up, and uncoils her roots, and 
sticks them down one by one into 
the holes she'd left, and sort of 
scrunches into place and looks 
peaceful. 

"Aren't they — dangerous?" 
asks Inspector Caldwell, pretty 
uneasy. 

"Not a bit," I says. "Things 
can change on Moklin. They 
don't have to fight. Things fight 
in other places because they can't 
change and they get crowded, and 
that's the only way they can meet 
competition. But there's a special kind of evolution on Moklin. 
Cooperative, you might call it. 
It's a nice place to live. Only 
thing is everything matures so 
fast. Four years and a Moklin is 
grown up, for instance." 

She sniffs. "What about that 
other trading post?" she says, 
sharp. "Who's back of it? The 
Company is supposed to have exclusive trading rights here. Who's 
trespassing?" 

"Brooks is trying to find out," 
I says. "They got a good complete line of trade goods, but the 
Moklins always say the humans 
running the place have gone off 
somewhere, hunting and such. 
We ain't seen any of them." 

"No?" says the girl, short. '*TU 
see them! We can't have competition in our exclusive territory! 

The rest of Mr. Brooks' re


ports — " She stops. Then she 
says, "That clerk of yours reminds me of someone I know." 

"He's a Moklin," I explain, 
"but he looks like a Company 
man named Casey. Casey's Area 
Director over on Khatim Two 
now, but he used to be here, and 
Deeth is the spit and image of 
him." 

"Outrageous!" says Inspector 
Caldwell, looking disgusted. 

There's a couple of trees pushing hard at each other. They are 
fighting, tree-fashion, for a specially good place. And there's 
others waddling around, mad as 
hell, because somebody else beat 
them to the spots they liked. I 
watch them. Then I grin, becauce 
a couple of young trees duck under the fighting big ones and set 
their roots down in the place the 
big trees was fighting over. 

"I don't like your attitude!" 
says Inspector Caldwell, furious. 

She goes stamping into the 
post, leaving me puzzled. What's 
wrong with me smiling at those 
kid trees getting the best of their 
betters? 

THAT afternoon Brooks comes 
back, marching ahead of a 
pack of woods-Moklins with 
greenish skins and saucer eyeg 
that've been guiding him around. 
He's a good-looking kind of fellow, Brooks is, with a good build 
and a solid jaw. 



IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN 



When he comes out of the 
woods on the landing field — the 
trees are all settled down by then 
—he's striding impatient and 
loose -jointed. With the woodsMoklins trailing him, he looks 
plenty dramatic, like a visi-reel 
picture of a explorer on some unknown planet, coming back from 
the dark and perilous forests, followed by the strange natives who 
do not yet know whether th is 
visitor from outer space is a god 
or what. You know the stuff. 

I see Inspector Caldwell take 
a good look at him, and I see her 
eyes widen. She looks like he is 
a shock, and not a painful one. 

He blinks when he sees her. 
He grunts, "What's tins? A sheMoklin?" 

Inspector Caldwell draws herself up to her full five-foot-three. 
She bristles. 

I say quick. "This here is Inspector Caldwell that the Palmyra dumped off here today. LTh 
— Inspector, this is Brooks, the 
Head Trader." 

They shake hands. He looks at 
her and says, "I'd lost hope my 
reports would ever get any attention paid to them. You've 
come to check my report that the 
trading post on Moklin has to be 
abandoned?" 

"I have not!" says Inspector 
Caldwell, sharp. "That's absurd! 
This planet has great potentialities, this post is profitable and 



the natives are friendly, and the 
trade should continue to increase. 
The Board is even considering the 
introduction of special crops." 

That strikes me as a bright 
idea. I'd like to see what would 
happen if Moklins started cultivating "hew kinds of plants! It 
would be a thing to watch — with 
regular Moklin plants seeing 
Strangers getting good growing 
places and special attention! I 
can't even guess what'll happen, 
but I want to watch! 

"What I want to ask right off," 
says Inspector Caldwell, fierce, 
"is why you have allowed a competitive trading post to be established, why you did not report it 
sooner, and why you haven't 
identified the company back of 
it?" 

Brooks stares at her. He gets 
mad. 

"Hell!" he says. "My reports 
cover all that! Haven't you read 
them?" 

"Of course not," says Inspector 
Caldwell. "I was given an outline 
of the situation here and told to 
investigate and correct it." 

"Oh!" says Brooks. "That's 
it!" 

Then he looks like he's swallowing naughty words. It is funny 
to see them glare at each other, 
both of them looking like they 
are seeing something that interests them plenty, but throwing 
off angry sparks just the same. 




 



"If you'll show me samples of 
their trade goods," says Inspector 
Caldwell, arrogant, "and I hope 
you can do that much, I'll identify the trading company handling them!" 

He grins at her without amusement and leads the way to the 
inside of the trading post. We 
brin g out the stuff we've had 
some of our Moklins go over and 
buy for us. Brooks dumps the 
goods on a table and stands back 
to see what she'll make of them, 
grinning with the same lack of 
mirth. She picks up a visi-reel 
projector. 

"Hmm," she says, scornful. 
"Not very good quality. It's . , ." 
Then she stops. She picks up a 
forest knife. "This," she says, "is 
a product of — " Then she stops 
again. She picks up some cloth 
and fingers it. 'She really steams. 
"I see!" she says, angry. "Because we have been on this planet 
so long and the Moklins are used 
to our goods, the people of the 
other trading post duplicate 
them! Do they cut prices?" 

"Fifty per cent," says Brooks. 

U chime in, "But we ain't lost 
much trade. Lots of Moklins still 
trade with us, out of friendship. 
Friendly folks, these Moklins." 

Just then Deeth comes in, looking just like Casey that used to 
be here on Moklin. He grins at 
me. 

"A girl just brought you a com


pliment," he lets me know. 

"Shucks!" I says, embarrassed 
and pleased. "Send her in and get 
a present for her." 

Deeth goes out. Inspector 
Caldwell hasn't noticed. She's 
seething over that other trading 
company copying our trade goods 
and underselling us on a planet 
we're supposed to have exclusive. 
Brooks looks at her grim. 

"I shall look over their post,** 
she announces, fierce, "and if they 
want a trade war, they'll get one! 
We can cut prices if we need to 
— we have all the resources of the 
Company behind us!" 

Brooks seems to be steaming 
on his own, maybe because she 
hasn't read his reports. But just 
then a Moklin girl comes in. Not 
bad-looking, either. You can see 
she is a Moklin — she ain't as 
convincing human as Deeth is, 
say — but she looks pretty human, 
at that. She giggles at me. 

"Compliment," she says, and 
shows me what she's carrying. 

I look. It's a Moklin kid, a 
boy, just about brand-new. And 
it has my shape ears, and its nose 
looks like somebody had stepped 
on it — my nose is that way — and 
it looks like a very small-sized 
working model of me. I chuck it 
under the chin and say, "Kitchycoo!" It gurgles at me. 

"What's your name?" I ask the 
girl. 

She tells me. I don't remember 



IF YOU WAS A MOKIIN 



ft, and I don't remember ever seeing her before, but she's paid me 
a compliment, all right — Moktfnstyle. 

"Mighty nice,*' I say. "Cute as 
atl get-out. I hope he grows up 
to have more sense than I got, 
though." Then Deeth comes in. 
with a armload of trade stuff like 
Old Man Bland gave to the ftrst 
Moklin kid that was born with 
long whiskers like his, and I say, 
"Thanks for the compliment. I 
am greatly honored." 

She takes the stuff and giggles 
again, and goes out. The kid 
beams at me over her shoulder 
and waves its fist. Mighty humanlike. A right cute kid, any 
way you look at it. 

Then I hear a noise. Inspector 
Caldwell is regarding me with 
loathing in her eyes. 

"Did you say they were friendly creatures?" she asks, bittef- "I 
think affectionate would be a better word V* Her voice shakes. 
"You are going to be transferred 
Out of here the instant the Pafmyra gets back!" 

"What's the matter?" I ask, 
surprised. "She paid me a compliment and I gave her a present. 
It's a custom. She's satisfied. I 
never see her before that I remember." 

"You don't?" she says. "The — 
th e callousness f You' re revol t ing!" 

j Brooks begins to sputter, then. 



he snickers, and all of a sudden 
he's howling with laughter. He is 
laughing at Inspector Caldwell. 
Then I get it, and I snort. Then 
I hoot and holler. It gets funnier 
when she gets madder still. She 
near blows up from being mad! 

We must look crazy, the two 
of us there in the post, just hollering with laughter while she 
gets furiouser and furiouser. Finally I have to lay down on the 
floor to laugh more comfortable. 
You see, she doesn't get a bit of 
what I've told her about there 
being a special kind of evolution 
on Moklin. The more disgusted 
and furious she looks at me, the 
harder I have to laugh. I can't 
help it 

WHEN wc set out for the other 
trading post next day, the 
atmosphere ain't what you'd call 
exactly cordial. There is just the 
Inspector and me, with Deeth 
and a couple of other Moklins 
for the look of things. She has on 
a green forest suit, and with her 
red hair she sure looks good! But 
she looks at me cold when Brooks 
says I'll take her over to the other 
post, and she doesn't say a word 
the first mile or two. 

We trudge on, and presently 
Deeth and the others get ahead 
so they can't hear what she says. 
And she remarks indignant, "I 
must say Mr. Brooks isn't very 
cooperative. Why didn't he come 



N 




 



with me? Is he afraid of the men 
at the other post?" 

"Not him," I says. "He's a 
good guy. But you got authority 
over him and you ain't read his 
reports." # 

"If I have authority," she says, 
sharp, "I assure you it's because 
I'm competent!" 

"I don't doubt it," I says. "If 
you wasn't cute^ he wouldn't care. 
But a man don't want a goodlooking girl giving him orders. He 
wants to give them to her. A 
homely woman, it don't matter." 

SHE tosses her head, but it 
don't displease her. Then she 
says, "What's in the reports that 
1 should have read?" 

"I don't know," I admit. "But 
he's been sweating over them. It 
makes him mad that nobody 
bothered to read 'em." 

"Maybe," she guesses, "it was 
what I need to know about this 
other trading post. What do you 
know about it, Mr. Brinkley?" 

I tell her what Deeth has told 
Brooks. Brooks found out about 
it because one day some Moklins 
come in to trade and ask friendly 
why we charge so much for this 
and that. Deeth told them we'd 
always charged that, and they 
say the other trading post sells 
things cheaper, and Deeth says 
what trading post? So they up 
and tell him there's another post 
that sells the same kind of things 



we do, only cheaper. But that's 

all they'll say. 

So Brooks tells Deeth to 6nd 
out, and he scouts around and 
comes back. There is another 
trading post only fifteen miles 
away, and it is selling stuff just 
like ours. And it charges only 
half price. Deeth didn't see the 
men — just the Moklin clerks. We 
ain't been able to see the m< a 
either. 

"Why haven't you seen the 
men?" 

"Every time Brooks or me go 
over/' I explain, "the Moklins 
they got working for them say 
the other men are off somewhere. 
Maybe the're starting some more 
posts. We wrote 'era a note, asking what the hell they mean, but 
they never answered it. Of course, 
we ain't seen their books &r their 
living quarters — " 

"You could find out plenty by 
a glimpse at their books!" she 
snaps. "Why haven't you just 
marched in and made the Moklins show you what you want to 
know, since the men were away?" 

"Because," I says, patient, 
"Moklins imitate humans. If we 
start trouble, they'll start it too. 
We can't set a example of rough 
stuff like burglary, mayhem, 
breaking and entering, manslaughter, or bigamy, or those 
Moklins will do just like us." 

"Bigamy!" She grabs on that 
sardonic. "If you're trying to 



IP YCU WAS A MOKLIN

make me think you've got enough 
moral sense — " 

I get a little mad. Brooks and 
me, we've explained to her, careful, how it is admiration and the 
way evolution works on Moklin 
that makes Moklin kids get born 
With long whiskers and that the 
compliment the Moklin girl has 
paid me is just exactly that. But 
she hasn't listened to a word. 

"Miss Caldwell," I says, 
"Brooks and me told you the 
facts. We tried to tell them delicate, to spare your feelings. Now 
if you'll try to spare mine, I'll 
thank you." 

"If you mean your finer feelings," she says, sarcastic, "I'll 
spare them as soon as I find 
some!" 

So I shut up. There's no use 
trying to argue with a woman. 
We tramp on through the forest 
without a word. Presently we 
come on a nest -bush. It's a pretty 
big one. There are a couple dozen 
nests on it, from the little-bitty 
bud ones no bigger than your 
fist, to the big ripe ones lined 
with soft stuff that have busted 
Open and have got cacklebirds 
housekeeping in them now. 

There are two cacklebirds sitting on a branch by the nest that 
is big enough to open up and 
have eggs laid in it, only it ain't. 
The cacklebirds are making 
noises like they are cussing it and 
telling it to hurry up and open. 



because they are in a hurry. 

"That's a nest-bush," I says. 
"It grows nests for the cacklebirds. The birds — uh — fertilize 
the ground around it. They're 
sloppy feeders and drop a lot of 
stuff th^t rots and is fertilizer too. 
The nest -bush and the cacklebirds kind of cooperate. That's 
the way evolution works on Moklin, like Brooks and me told you." 

She tosses that red head of 
hers and stamps on, not saying 
a word. So we get to the other 
trading post. And there she gets 
one of these slow-burning, longlasting mads on that fill a guy 
like me with awe. 

There's only Moktins at the 
other trading post, as usual. They 
say the humans are off somewhere. They look at her admiring 
and polite. They show her their 
stock. It is practically identical 
with ours — only they admit that 
they've sold out of some items 
because their prices are low. They 
act most respectful and pleased 
to see her. 

But she don't learn a thing 
about where their stuff comes 
from or what company is horning 
in on Moklin trade. And she looks 
at their head clerk and she burns 
and burns. 

WHEN we get back. Brooks 
is sweating over memorandums he has made, getting another report ready for the next 



9f> 




 



Company ship. Inspector Caldwell marches into the trade room 
and gives orders in a controlled, 
venomous voice. Then she marches right in on Brooks. 

"I have just ordered the Moklin sales force to cut the price on 
all items on sale by seventy-five 
per cent," she says, her voice 
trembling a little with fury. "I 
have also ordered the credit given 
for Moklin trade goods to be 
doubled. They want a trade war? 
They'll get it!" 

SHE is a lot madder than business would account for. 
Brooks says, tired, "I'd like to 
show you some facts. I've been 
over every inch of territory in 
thirty miles, looking for a place 
where a ship could land for that 
other post. There isn't any. Does 
that mean anything to you?" 

"The post is there, isn't 
it?" she says. "And they have 
trade goods, haven't they? And 
we have exclusive trading rights 
on Moklin, haven't we? That's 
enough for me. Our job is to 
drive them out of business!" 

But she is a lot madder than 
business would account for. 
Brooks says, very weary, "There's 
nearly a whole planet where they 
could have put another trading 
post. They could have set up 
shop on the other hemisphere 
and charged any price they 
pleased. But they set up shop 



right next to us! Does that make 

sense?" 

"Setting up close," she says, 
"would furnish them with customers already used to human 
trade goods. And it furnished 
them with Moklins trained to be 
interpreters and clerks ! And — " 
Then it come out, what she's raging, boiling, steaming, burning up 
about. "And," she says, furious, 
"it furnished them with a Moklin 
head-clerk who is a very handsome young man, Mr. Brooks! 
He not only resembles you in 
every feature, but he even has a 
good many of your mannerisms. 
You should be very proud!" 

With this she slams out of the 
room. Brooks blinks. 

"She won't believe anything," 
he says, sour, "except only that 
man is vile. Is that true about a 
Moklin who looks like me?" 

I nod. 

"Funny his folks never showed 
him to me for a complimentpresent!" Then he stares at me, 
hard. "How good is the likeness?" 

"If he is wearing your clothes," 
I tell him, truthful, "I'd^wear he 
is you." 

Then Brooks — slow, very slow 
- — turns white. "Remember the 
time you went off with Deeth 
and his folks, hunting? That was 
the time a Moklin got killed. 
You were wearing guest garments, weren't you?" 

I feel queer inside, but I nod. 



IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN 



97 



Guest garments, for Moklins, arc 
like the best bedroom and the 
drumstick of the chicken among 
humans. And a Moklin hunting 
party is something. They go 
hunting garlikthos, which you 
might as well call dragons, because they've got scales and they 
fly and they are tough babies. 

The way to hunt them is you 
take along some cacklebirds that 
ain't nesting — they are no good 
for anything while they're honeymooning—and the cacklebirds go 
flapping around until a garlikthos 
comes after them, and then they 
go jet-streaking to where the 
hunters are, cackling a blue 
streak to say, "Here 1 come, boys! 
Hold everything until I get past!" 
Then the garlikthos dives after 



them and the hunters get it as 
it dives. 

You give the cacklebirds its innards, and they sit around and 
eat, cackling to each other, zestful, like they're bragging about 
the otker times they done the 
same thing, only better. 

"You were wearing guest garments?" repeats Brooks, grim. 

I feel very queer inside, but I 
nod again. Moklin guest garments are mighty easy on the 
skin and feel mighty good. They 
ain't exactly practical hunting 
clothes, but the Moklins feel bad 
if a human that's their guest don't 
wear them. And of course he has 
to shed his human clothes to 
wear them. 

"What's the idea?" I want to 





 



know. But I feel pretty unhappy 
inside. 

"You didn't come back for one 
day, in the middle of the hunt, 
after tobacco and a bath?" 

"No," I says, beginning to get 
rattled. "We were way over at 
the Thunlib Hilts. We buried the 
dead Moklin over there and had 
a hell of a time building a tomb 
over him. Why?" 

"During that week," says 
Brooks, grim, "and while you 
were off wearing Moklin guest 
garments, somebody came back 
wearing your clothes — and got 
some tobacco and passed the time 
of day and went off again. Joe, 
just like there's a Moklin you say 
could pass for me, there's one 
that could pass for you. In fact, 



he did. Nobody suspected either.** 
I get panicky. "But what'd he 
do that for?" I want to know. 
"He didn't steal anything! Would 
he have done it just to brag to 
the other Moklins that he fooled 
you?" 

"He might," says Brooks, 
"have been checking to see if he 
could fool me. Or Captain Haney 
of the Palmyra. Or — " 

He looks at me. I feel myself 
going numb. This can mean one 
hell of a mess! 

"I haven't told you before," 
says Brooks, "but I've been 
guessing at something like this. 
Moklins like to be human, and 
they get human kids — kids that 
look human, anyway. Maybe 
they can want to be smart like 



IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN 



humans, and they are." He tries 
to grin, and can't. "That rival 
trading post looked fishy to me 
right at the start. They're practicing with that. It shouldn't be 
there at all, but it is. You see?" 

I feel weak and sick all over. 
This is a dangerous sort of thing! 
But I say quick, "If you mean 
they got Moklins that could pass 
for you and me, and they're figuring to bump us off and take 
our places — I don't believe that! 
Moklins like humans! They 
wouldn't harm humans for anything!" 

Brooks don't pay any attention. He says, harsh, "I've been 
trying to persuade the Company 
that we've got to get out of here, 
fast! And they send this Inspector 
Caldwell, who's not only female, 
but a redhead to boot! All they 
think about is a competitive trading post! And all she sees is that 
we're a bunch of lascivious scoundrels, and since she's a woman 
there's nothing that'll convince 
her otherwise!" 

Then something hits me. It 
looks hopeful. 

"She's the first human woman 
to land on Moklin. And she has 
got red hair. It's the first red hair 
the Moklins ever saw. Have we 
got time?" 

He figures. Then he says, 
"With luck, it ought to turn up! 
You've hit it!" And then his expression sort of softens. "If that 



happens — poor kid, she's going to 
take it hard! Women hate to be 
wrong. Especially redheads! But 
that might be the saving of — of 
humanity, when you think of it." 

I blink at him. He goes on, 
fi erce , "Look , Vm no Mokl i n ! 
You kHow that. But if there's a 
Moklin that looks enough like 
me to take my place . . . You see? 
We got to think of Inspector 
Caldwell, anyhow. If you ever 
see me cross my fingers, you wiggle your little finger. Then I 
Jihow it's you. And the other way 
about. Get it? You swear you'll 
watch over Inspector Caldwell?" 

"Sure!" I say. "Of course!" 

I wiggle my little linger. He 
crosses his. It's a signal nobody 
but us two would know. I feel a 
lot better. 

T> ROOKS goesr off next morning, grim, to visit the other 
trading post and see the Moklin 
that looks so much like him. Inspector Caldwell goes along, fierce, 
and I'm guessing it's to see the 
fireworks when Brooks sees his 
Moklin double that she thinks is 
more than a coincidence. Which 
she is right, only not in the way 
she thinks. 

Before they go, Brooks crosses 
his fingers and looks at me significant. I wiggle my little finger 
back at him. They go off. 

I sit down in the shade of Sally 
and try to think things out. I 



Too 




 



am all churned up inside, and 
scared as hell. It's near two weeks 
to landing time, when the old 
Palmyra ought to come bulging 
down out of the sky with a load 
of new trade goods. I think wistful about how swell everything 
has been on Moklin up to now, 
and how Moklins admire humans, and how friendly everything has been, and how it's a 
great compliment for Moklins to 
want to be like humans, and to 
get like them, and how no Moklin would ever dream of hurting 
a human and how they imitate 
humans joyous and reverent and 
happy. Nice people, Moklins. 
But— 

The end of things is in sight. 
Liking humans has made Moklins smart, but now there's been 
a slip-up. Moklins will do anything to produce kids that look 
like humans. That's a compliment. But no human ever sees a 
Moklin that's four or five years 
old and all grown up and looks 
so much like him that nobody 
can tell them apart. That ain't 
scheming. It's just that Moklins 
like humans, but they're scared 
the humans might not like to see 
themselves in a sort of Moklin 
mirror. So if they did that at all, 
they'd maybe keep it a secret, 
like children keep secrets from 
grownups. 

Moklins are a lot like kids. You 
can't help liking thefn. "But a 



human can get plenty panicky if 
he thinks what would happen if 
Moklins get to passing for humans among humans, and want 
their kids to have top-grade 
brains, and top-grade talents, and 
so on . . . 

I sweat, sitting there. I can see 
the whole picture. Brooks is worrying about Moklins loose among 
humans, outsmarting them as 
their kids grow up, being the big 
politicians, the bosses, the planetary pioneers, the prettiest girls 
and the handsomest guys in the 
Galaxy — everything humans 
want to be themselves. Just 
thinking about it is enough to 
make any human feel like he's 
going nuts. But Brooks is also 
worrying about Inspector Caldwell, who is five foot three and 
red-headed and cute as a bug's 
ear and riding for a bad fall. 

They come back from the trip 
to the other trading post. Inspector Caldwell is baffled and 
mad. Brooks is sweating and 
scared. He slips me the signal 
and 1 wiggle my little finger back 
at him, just so I'll know he didn't 
get substituted for without Inspector Caldwell knowing it, and 
so he knows nothing happened to 
me while he was gone. They 
didn't see the Moklin that looks 
like Brooks. They didn't get a 
bit of information we didn't have 
before — which is just about none 
at all. 



IF YOU WAS A MOK LI M 



Things go on. Brooks and me 
are sweating it out until the Palmyra lets down out of the sky 
again, meanwhile praying for Inspector Caldwell to get her ears 
pinned back so proper steps can 
be taken, and every morning he 
crosses his fingers at me, and I 
wiggle my little finger back at 
him . . . And he watches over Inspector Caldwell tender. 

THE other trading post goes on 
placid. They sell their stuff 
at half the price we sell ours 
for. So, on Inspector Caldwell's orders, we cut ours again 
to half what they sell theirs for. 
So they sell theirs for half what 
we sell ours for, so we sell ours for 
half what they sell theirs for. And 
so on. Meanwhile we sweat. 

Three days before the Palmyra 
is due, our goods are marked at 
just exactly one per cent of what 
they was marked a month before, and the other trading post 
is selling them at half that. It 
looks like we are going to have to 
pay a bonus to Moklins to take 
goods away for us to compete 
with the other trading post. 

Otherwise, everything looks 
normal on the surface. Moklins 
hang around as usual, friendly 
and admiring. They'll hang 
around a couple days just to get 
a look at Inspector Caldwell, and 
they regard her respectful. 
Brooks looks grim. He is head 



over heels crazy about her now, 
and she knows it, and she rides 
him hard. She snaps at him, and 
he answers her patient and gentle 
— because he knows that when 
what he hopes is going to happen, she is going to need him to 
comfort her. She has about wiped 
out our stock, throwing bargain 
sales. Our shelves are almost bare. 
But the other trading post still 
has plenty of stock. 

"Mr. Brooks," says Inspector 
Caldwell, bitter, at breakfast, 
"we'll have to take most of the 
Palmyra's cargo to fill up our inventory." 

"Maybe," he says, tender, "and 
maybe not." 

"But we've got to drive that 
other post out of business!" she 
says, desperate. Then she breaks 
down. "This — this is my first independent assignment. I've got to 
handle it successfully!" 

He hesitates. But just then 
Deeth comes in. He beams 
friendly at Inspector Caldwell. 

"A compliment for you, 
ma'am. Three of them." 

She goggles at him. Brooks 
says, gentle, "It's all right. Deeth, 
show them in and get some presents." 

Inspector Caldwell splutters 
incredulous, "But — but — " 

"Don't be angry," says Brooks. 
"They mean it as a compliment 
It is, actually, you know." 

Three Moklin girls come in, 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE F I r T I O H* 



giggling. They are not bad-looking at all. They look as human 
as Deeth, but one of them has a 
long, droopy mustache like a ■ 
mate of the Palmyra — that's because, they hadn't ever seen a 
human woman before Inspector 
Caldwell come along. They sure 
have admired her, though! And 
Moklin kids get born fast. Very 
fast. 

They show her what they are 
holding so proud and happy in 
their arms. They have got three 
little Moklin kids, one apiece. 
And every one of them has red 
hair, just like Inspector Caldwell, 
and every one of them is a girl 
that is the spit and image of her. 
You would swear they are human 
babies, and you'd swear they are 
hers. But of course they ain't. 
They make kid noises and wave 
their little fists. 

Inspector Caldwell is just plain 
paralyzed. She stares at them, 
and goes red as fire and white as 
chalk, and she is speechless. So 
Brooks has to do the honors. He 
admires the kids extravagant, and 
the Moklin girls giggle, and take 
the compliment presents Deeth. 
brings in, and they go out happy. 

When the door closes, Inspector Caldwell wilts. 

"Oh-h!" she wails. "It's true! 
You didn't — you haven't — they 
can make their babies look like 
anybody they want!" 

Brooks puts his arms around 



her and she begins to cry against 
his shoulder. He pats her and 
says, "They've got a queer sort 
of evolution on Moklin, darling, 
Babies here inherit desired characteristics. Not acquired characteristics, but desired ones! And 
what could be more desirable 
than you?" 

I am blinking at them. He says 
to me, cold, "Will you kindly get 
the hell out of here and stay 
out?" 

I come to. I says, "Just one 
precaution." 

I wiggle my little finger. He 
crosses his fingers at me. 

"Then," I says, "since there's 
no chance of a mistake, I'll leave 
you two together." 

And I do. 

PTlHE Palmyra booms down out 
of the sky two days later. 
We are all packed up. Inspector 
Caldwell is shaky, on the porch, 
of the post, when Moklins come 
hollering and waving friendly 
over from the landing field pulling a freight-truck with Cap 
Haney on it. I see other festive 
groups around members of the 
crew that — this being a scheduled 
stop — have been given ship-leave 
for a couple hours to visit their 
Moklin friends. 

"I've got the usual cargo — ** 
begins Cap Haney. 

"Don't discharge it," says Inspector Caldwell, firm. "We are 



IF YOU WAS A MOKLIN 



103 



abandoning this post. 1 have authority and Mr. Brooks has convinced me of the necessity for it. 
Please get our baggage to the 
ship." 

He gapes at her. "The Company don't like to give in to 
competition — " 

"There isn't any competition," 
says Inspector Caldwell. She 
gulps. "Darling, you tell him," 
she says to Brooks. 

He says, lucid, "She's right, 
Captain. The other trading post 
is purely a Moklin enterprise. 
They like to do everything that 
humans do. Since humans were 
running a trading post, they 
opened one too. They bought 
goods from us and pretended to 
sell them at half price, and we 
cut our prices, and they bought 
more goods from us and pretended to sell at half the new 
prices. . . . Some Moklin or other 
must've thought it would be nice 
to be a smart businessman, so his 
kids would be smart businessmen. Too smart ! We close up 
this post before Moklins think of 
other things . . 

He means, of course, that if 
Moklins get loose from their 
home planet and pass as humans, 
their kids can maybe take over 
human civilization. Human nature couldn't take that! But it is 
something to be passed on to the 
high brass, and not told around 
general. 



"Better sound the emergency 
recall signal," says Inspector 
Caldwell, brisk. 

We go over to the ship and the 
Palmyra lets go that wailing siren 
that'll carry twenty miles. Any 
crew member in hearing is going 
to beat it back to the ship fullspeed. They come running from 
every wh ich wa3*. « here they 
been visiting their Moklin friends. 
And then, all of a sudden, here 
comes a fellow wearing Moklin 
guest garments, yelling, 'Hey I 
Wait! I ain't got my clothec — " 

And then there is what you 
might call a dead silence. Because 
lined up for checkoff is another 
guy that comes running at the 
recall signal, and he is wearing 
ship's clothes, and you can see 
that him and the guy in Moklin 
guest garments are just exactly 
alike. Twins. Identical. The spit 
and image of each other. And it is 
for sure that one of them is a 
Moklin. But which? 

Cap Haney's eyes start to pop 
out of his head. But then the guy 
in Palmyra uniform grins and 
says, "Okay, I'm a Moklin. But 
us Moklins like humans so much, 
I thought it would be nice to 
make a trip to Earth and see 
more humans. My parents planned it five years ago, made me 
look like this wonderful human, 
and hid me for this moment But 
we would not want to make any 
difficulties for humans, so I have 



104 




 



confessed and I will leave the 

ship." 

He takes it as a joke on. him. 
He talks English as good as anybody. I don't know how anybody 
could tell which was the human 
guy and which one the Moklin, 
but this Moklin grins and steps 
down, and the other Moklins admire him enormous for passing 
even a few minutes as human 
among humans. 

We get away from there so 
fast, he is allowed to keep the 
human uniform.' 

MOKLIN is the first planet 
that humans ever get off of, 
moving fast, breathing hard, and 
sweating copious. It's one of 
those things that humans just 
can't take. Not that there's anything wrong with Moklins. 
They're swell folks. They like 
humans. But humans just can't 
take the idea of Moklins passing 
for human and being all the 
things humans want to be themselves. I think it's really a false 
alarm. I'll find out pretty soonInspector Caldwell and Brooks 
get married, and they go off to 
a post on Briarius Four — a swell 
place for a honeymoon if there 
ever was one — and I guess they 
are living happy ever after. Me, 
I go to the new job the Company assigns me — telling me stern 
not to talk about Moklin, which 
I don't — and the Space Patrol or


ders no human ship to land on 
Moklin for any reason. 

But I've been saving money 
and worrying. I keep thinking of 
those three Moklin kids that Inspector Caldwell knows she ain't 
the father of. I worry about those 
kids. I hope nothing's happened 
to them. Moklin kids grow up 
fast, like I told you. They'll be 
just about grown now. 

I'll tell you. I've bought me a 
little private spacecruiser, small 
but good. I'm shoving off for 
Moklin next week. If one of those 
three ain't married, I'm going to 
marry her, Moklin-style, and 
bring her out to a human colony 
planet. We'll have some kids. I 
know just what I want my kids 
to be like. They'll have plenty of 
brains — top-level brains — and the 
girls will be real good-looking! 

But besides that, I've got to 
bring some other Moklins out and 
start them passing for human, 
too. Because my kids are going 
to need other Moklins to marry, 
ain't they? It's not that I don't 
like humans. I do! If the fellow 
I look like — Joe Brinkley — hadn't 
got killed accidental on that 
hunting trip with Deeth, I never 
would have thought of taking his 
place and being Joe Brinkley. 
But you can't blame me for wanting to live among humans. 

Wouldn't you, if you was a 
Moklin ?
