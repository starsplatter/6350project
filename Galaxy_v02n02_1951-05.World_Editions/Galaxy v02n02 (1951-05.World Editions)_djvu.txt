Looking 



Backward 



THE rating of stories in individual issues of a magazine seems to me a very 
faulty way to determine their value. 
However, our writers have pressed 
hard for it and they must, of course, 
be kept happy. Every half year, 
therefore, GALAXY will sum up 
the readers' votes . . . plus my comments. 

Two exceptions should be made, 
I think— serials and articles. The 
only fair way to rate these is against 
each other, and most readers seem 
to share this opinion. Ignoring this 
common sense practice would create 
an artificial result. 

Starting with Vol . 1 , No. 1 , 
then, here is how our readers rate 
GALAXY issue by issue. 
• October, 1950: 1. The Stars Are 
the Styx, Theodore Sturgeon ; 2 . 
Contagion, Katherine MacLe?.n; 3. 
The Last Martian, Fredric Brown; 
4. Later Than You Think, Fritz 
Leiber; 5. Darwinian Pool Room, 
Isaac Asimov; 6. Third from the 
Sun, Richard Matheson. 

There's not much doubt that the 



two novelets headed the issue. The 
rest of the stories, though, suffer 
because of an absurd situation: only 
novelets and short-shorts were to be 
found at the time. These stories 
should have been used in separate 
issues, and would have been if 
longer ones had been available. 

Selected for book reprint from 
this issue: The Stars Are the Styx, 
Contagion, The Last Martian, Later 
Than You Think and, naturally, 
Time Quarry, which ran in this and 
the nc::t two issues. 
• November, 1910: I. To Serve 
Man, Damon Knight; 2. Misbegotten Missionary, Isaac Asimov; 3. 
Honeymoon in Hell, Fredric 
Brown; 4. Transfer Point, Anthony 
Boucher; 5 . Coming Attraction, 
Fritz Leiber. 

If the distances between the first 
four items are measured micrometricaily, these ratings are proper 
enough. Polled privately, however, 
the writers of these stories gave 
Coming Attraction first place, 
while some of our readers attacked 
it as '"degenerate, ' ' mistaki ng a 



z 




 



terxffyingly clear warning for approval. 

For book reprint: To Serve Man, 
Transfer Point, Coming Attraction. 
Negotiations are also going on for 
Honeymoon in Hell and Misbegotten Missionary. If they are concluded, every item hi this issue will 
be published in book form, including Lands of Yesterday, that 
month's article by L. Spraguc de 
Camp. 

• December, 1950: 1. Second Night 
of Summer, James H. Schmitz; 

2. Judas Ram, Sam Merwin, Jr., 

3. The Waker Dreams, Richard 
Matheson; 4. A Stone and a Spear, 
Raymond F. Jones; 5. Jaywalker, 
Ross Rocklynne. 

The situation here was the reverse of October's; plenty of shorts, 
a dearth of novelets and shortshorts. Both novelets were fully acceptable and certainly nothing to be 
ashamed of, but I would have preferred less traditional themes. The 
shorts, on the other hand, reflected 
the evolving GALAXY policy. 

For book reprint: Second Night 
of Summer, Judas Ram. 

• January, 1931: l. Rule of Three, 
Theodore Sturgeon; 2. The Reluctant Heroes, Frank M. Robinson; 
3. Susceptibility, John D. MacDonald; 4. Dark Interlude, Fredric 
Brown and Mack Reynolds; 5. 
Made to Measure, Win, Campbell 
Gaulfc 

Dark Interlude, like Coming Attraction, was misinterpreted by a 
number of readers. Far from pro


moting race prejudice, the intent 
was exactly the opposite. This is, of 
course, the danger in using irony. 

For book reprint: Rule of Three, 
Dark Interlude, and Tyrann, which 
ran in this issue and the next two. 

• February, 1951: I, The fireman, 
Ray Bradbury; 2. Second Childhood, Clifford D. Simak; 3. 
. . . And It Comes out Here, Lester 
del Rey; 4. Two Weeks in August, 
Frank M. Robinson; 5. The Protector, Betsy Curtis. 

Here is a prime example of how 
editorial balance can ruin a story's 
rating; these light shorts were deliberately selected to weigh against 
the shattering emotion of The Fireman and Second Childhood. 

• March, 1951: 1. The Wind Between the Worlds, Lester del Rey; 
2. Good Night, Mr. James, Clifford 
D. Simak; 3. Socrates, John Christopher; 4. The Other Now, Murray 
Leinster. 

From the editorial point of view, 
this issue shapes up somewhat differently. TWBTW is a strong science problem story; GNMJ is 
suspense; both are balanced by the 
shorts, which arc human interest. It 
is too soon for anthologists to have 
hit these two issues so only GNMJ 
has been definitely scheduled for 
book reprint thus far. 

On the whole. Vol. 1 shows a 
steady growth when viewed as a 
unit, The first two issues of Vol. 2 
should indicate that this growth has, 
if anything, accelerated.

The inevitable union of Science and the Imagination finally established in a book

it was revised by Newton and

Bridge Crossing 




BY DAVE DRYFOOS 

He knew ihe city was organized for his individual defense, for 
it had been that way since he was born. But who was his enemy? 



IN 1849, the mist that sometimes rolled through the Golden Gate was known as fog. 
In 2149, it had become far more 
frequent, and was known as smog. 
By 2349, it was fog again. 

But tonight there was smoke 
mixed with the fog. Roddie could 



smell it. Somewhere in die forested 
ruins, fire was burning. 

He wasn't worried. The small 
blaze that smoldered behind him 
on the cracked concrete floor had 
consumed everything burnable 
within blocks; what remained of 
the gutted concrete office building 



lllustro+ed by HARRISON 



BRIDGE CROSSING 



from which he peered was fireproof. 

But Roddie was himself aflame 
w,ith anger. As always when Invaders broke in from the north, 
he'd been left behind with his 
nurse, Molly, while the soldiers 
went out to light. 

And nowadays Molly's presence 
wasn't the comfort it used to be. 
He felt almost ready to jump out 
of his skin, the way she rocked and 
knitted in that grating ruined chair, 
saying over and over again, "The 
soldiers don't want little boys. The 
soldiers don't want little boys. The 
soldiers don't — " 

"I'm not a little boy!" Roddie 
suddenly shouted. "I'm full-grown 
and I've never even seen an Invader. Why won 'it you let me go 
and fight?" 

Fiercely he crossed the bare, 
gritty floor and shook Molly's 
shoulder. She rattled under his jarring hand, and abruptly changed 
the subject. 

"A is for Atom, B is for Bomb, 
C is for Corpse -" she chanted. 

Roddie reached into her shapeless dress and pinched. Lately that 
tad helped her over these spells. 
But 'this time, though it stopped 
the kindergarten song, the treatment 
only started something worse. 

"Wuzzums hungry?" Molly 
cooed, still rocking. 

Utterly disgusted, Roddie ripped 
her head off her neck. 

It was a completely futile gesture. The complicated mind that had 



cared for him and taught him 
speech and the alphabet hadn't 
made him a mechanic, and his 
only tool was a broken-handled 
screwdriver. 

HE WAS still tinkering when 
the soldiers came in. While 
they lined up along the wall, he 
put Molly's head back on her neck.' 

She gaped coyly at the new 
arrivals. "Hello, boys," she simpered. "Looking for a good time?" 

Roddie slapped her to silence, 
reflecting briefly that there were 
many things he didn't know about 
Molly. But there was work to be 
done. Carefully he framed the ritual 
words she'd taught him: "Soldiers, 
come to attention and report!" 

There were eleven of them, six 
feet tall, witti four limbs and eight 
extremities. They stood uniformly, 
the thumbs on each pair of hands 
touching along the center line of 
the legs, front feet turned out at 
an angle of forty-five degrees, rear 
feet turned inward at thirty degrees. 

"Sir," they chorused, "we have 
met the enemy and he is ours." 

He inspected them. All were 
scratched and dented, but -one in 
particular seemed badly damaged. 
His left arm was almost severed 
at the shoulder. 

"Come here, fellow," Roddie 
said. "Let's see if I can fix that." 

The soldier took a step forward, 
lurched suddenly, stopped, and 
whipped out a bayonet. 




 



"Death to Invaders!" he yelled, 
and charged crazily. 

Molly stepped in front of him. 

"You aren't being very nice to 
my baby," she murmured, and 
thrust her knitting needles into his 
eyes. 

Roddie jumped behind him, 
knocked off his helmet, and pressed 
a soft spot on his conical skull. 
The soldier collapsed to the floor. 

RODDIE salvaged ami returned 
Molly's needles. Then heexamincd the patient, tearing him apart 
as a boy dismembers an alarm clock. 

It was lucky he did. Th e left 
arm's pair of hands suddenly 
writhed off the floor jn an effort 
to choke him. But because the arm 
was detached .it the shoulder and 
therefore blind, he escaped the 
cluuhing onslaught and could goad 
the reflexing hands into assaulting 
one another harmlessly. 

Meanwhile, the other soldiers 
left, except for one, apparently another casualty, who stumbled on 
his way out and fell into the fire. 
By the time Roddie had hauled 
him clear, damage was beyond repair. Roddie swore, then decided 
to try combining parts of this casualty with pieces' of the other to 
make a whole one. 

To get more light for the operation, he poked up the fire. Roddie 
was new at his work, and took it 
seriously. It alarmed him to watch 
the soldiers melt away, gradually 
succumbing to battle damage, 



shamed him to see the empty ruins 
burn section by section as the Invaders repeat c d ly broke through 
and had to be burned out. 

Soon there would be nothing 
left of the Private Properly Keep 
Out that, according to Molly's bedtime story, the Owners had entrusted to them when driven away 
by radioactivity. Soon the soldiers 
themselves would be gone. None 
would remain to guard the city but 

a few strayed servants like Molly, 
and an occasional Civil Defender. 

And himsel f, Roddie reflected, 
spitting savagely into the fire. He 
might remain. But how he fitted 
into the picture, he didn't know. 
And Molly, who claimed to have 
found him in the ruins after a 
fight with Invaders twenty years 
before, couldn't or wouldn't say. 

Well, for as long as possible, 
Roddie decided, he'd do his duty 
as the others did theirs — singlemindedly. Eventually the soldiers 
might accept him as one of themselves; meanwhile, this newly attempted first aid was useful to 
them. 

He gave the fire a final poke and 
then paused, wondering if, when 
heated, his screwdriver could make 
an unfastened end of wire stick on 
the grayish spot where it seemed 
to belong. 

Stretching prone to blow the embers hot so he could try out Ins. 
new idea, Roddie got ±00 close to 
the flames. Instantly the room 
filled with the stench of singed

hair. Roddie drew angrily back, 
beating out the sparks in his uncut 
blond mane. 

As ihe stood slapping his head 
and muttering, a deranged Civil 
Defense firefighter popped into the 
doorway and covered him with 
carbon dioxide foam. 

Roddie fled. His life-long friends 
were not merely wearing out, they 
were unbearably wearing. 

IN THE street, even before he'd 
wiped off the foam, he regretted his flight. The fire was back 
home. And here in the cold of this 
fog-shrouded canyon, a mere trail 
between heaped-up walls of rubble, 
the diaper he wore felt inadequate 
against the pre-dawn cold. His 
cherished weapon, a magnetic tackhammer, was chill beneath the 
diaper's top, and the broken, radium-dialed wrist watch suspended 
from a string around his neck hung 
clammy against his chest. He stood 
irresolute on numbing bare feet, 
and considered returning to the 
more familiar bedlam. 

But colder than cold was his 
shame at being cold. Molly never 
was, though she knew how to keep 
him warm, nor were -the others. 
Hunger, thirst, pain and coldness 
were sensations never experienced 
by his friends. Like the growth he'd 
been undergoing till recently, these 
were things of ignominy, to be 
hidden as far as possible from inquiring eyes. Cold as It was, he'd 
have to hide. 



Temporarily, the darkness concealed him, though it was not quite 
complete. From above the fog. the 
moon played vaguely deceptive light 
on the splinters of architecture 
looming toward it. Some distance 
off, an owl hooted, but here nocturnal rodents felt free to squeak 
and rustle as they scampered. 

The world seemed ghostly. Yet 
it wasn't dead; it merely lurked. 
And as an irrepressible yawn reminded Roddie of his absurd need 
for sleep even in the midst of 
danger, he concluded for the 
thousandth time that the One 
who'd built him must have been an 
apprentice. 

For just such reasons he'd developed the hideout toward which 
he now walked. It had been the 
haven of his adolescence, when the 
discovery of how much he differed 
from his friends had been a shock, 
and 'the shock itself a difference to 
be hidden. 

His hiding place was a manhole, 
dead center in the dead street. A 
weathered bronze bar, carefully 
placed in the cover's slotted rim, 
was the levering key that opened 
its door. 

Everything was wrong tonight! 
He couldn't even find the bar. Of 
course that spoiled things, because 
the bar was a roller on which to 
move the heavy cover from below, 
and a support that held it ajar for 
ventilation. 

But the example of his friends 
had taught him above all else to 



8 




 



carry out every purpose. Molly was 
a nurse; she had raised him despite 
all obstacles. The soldiers were 
guards; they protected the ruins 
against everything larger than a 
rat. The firefighter had put even 
him out when he was aflame . . . 

Anyhow, the manhole cover had 
been loosened by his frequent handling. He lifted it aside by main 
strength, then flattened himself to 
the street, and felt with his feet for 
the top rung. 

Halfway down the iron ladder, 
something made him pause. He 
looke-d, but saw only blacking. He; 
listened, sniffed, found nothing. 
What could have entered through 
the iron cover? 

He sneered at his own timidity 
and jumped to the bottom, 

It was warm ! The dry bottom of 
the hole had the temperature of 
body heat, as if a large animal had 
recently rested there! 

QUICKLY, Roddie drew the 
hammer from his waist. Then, 
with weapon ready for an instantaneous blow, he stretched his left 
hand through the darkness. He 
touched something warm, softish. 
Gingerly he felt over that curving 
surface for identifying features. 

While Roddie investigated by 
touch, his long fingers were suddenly seized and bitten. At the 
same time, his eight shin received 
a savage kick. And his own retaliatory blow was checked in midswing by an unexpected voice. 



"Get your filthy hands off me!' 1 
it whispered angrily. "Who do you 
think you are?" 

Startled, he dropped his hammer. "I'm Roddie," he said, squatting to fumble for it. "Who do you 
think you are?" 

"I'm Ida, naturally ! Just how 
many girls are there in this raiding 
party?" 

His first Invader — and he had 
dropped his weapon ! 

Scrabbling fearfully in the dust 
for his hammer, Roddie paused 
suddenly. This girl — whatever (bat 
was — -seemed to think him one of 
her own kind. There was a chance, 
not much, but worth taking, to 
turn delay to advantage. Maybe he 
could learn something of value before he killed her. That would 
make the soldiers accept him! 

He stalled, seeking a gambit. 
"How would / know how many 
girls there are?" 

Half expecting a blow, he got 
instead an apology. "I'm sorry," 
the girl said. "I should have known. 
Never even heard your name before, either. Roddie . . . Whose 
boat did you come in, Roddie?" 

Boat? What was a boat? "How 
would I know?" he repeated, voice 
tight with fear of discovery. 

If she noticed the tension, she 
didn't show it. Certainly her whisper was friendly enough. "Oh, 
you're one of the fellows from 
Bodega, then. They shoved a boy 
into our boat at the last minute, 
too. Tough, wasn't it, getting sep

arated in the fog and tide like that? 
If only we didn't have to use 
boats . . . But, say, how are we 
going to get away from here?" 

"I wouldn't know," Roddie said, 
closing his fingers on the hammer, 
and rising. "How did you get in?" 

"Followed your footprints. It was 
sundown and I saw human tracks 
in the dust and they led me here. 
Where were you?" 

"Scouting around," Roddie said 
vaguely. "How did you know I 
was a man when I came back?" 

"Because you couldn't see me, 
silly! You know perfectly well 
these androids are heat-sensitive and 
can locate us in the dark!" 

Indeed he did know! Many times 
he'd felt ashamed that Molly could 
find him whenever she wanted to, 
even here in the manhole. But perhaps the manhole would help him 
now to redeem himself . . . 

"T'D LIKE .to get a look at you," 
X he said. 

The girl laughed self-consciously. 
"It's getting gray out. You'll see 
me soon enough." 

But she'd see him, Roddie realized. He had to talk fast. 

"What'll we do when it's light?" 
he asked. 

"Well, I guess the boats have 
gone," Ida said. "You could swim 
the Gate, I guess — you seem tall 
and strong enough. But I couldn't. 
You'll think it's crazy, but I've 
given this some thought, and even 
looked it over from the other side. 



I expect to try the Golden Gate 
Bridge!" 

Now he was getting somewhere ! 
The bridge was ruined, impassable. 
Even her own people had crossed 
the Strait by other means. But if 
there were a way over the bridge . . "It's broken," he said. "How in 
the world can we cross it?" 

"Oh, you'll find out, if you take 
me up there. I — I don't want to be 
alone, Roddie. Will you go with 
me? Now?" 

Well, she could be made to point 
out the route before he killed her 
— if nothing happened when she 
saw him. 

Uneasy, Roddie hefted the hammer in his hand. 

A giggle broke the pause. "It's 
nice of you to wait and let me go 
first up the ladder," the girl said. 
"But where the heck is the rusty 
old thing?" 

"I'll go first," said Roddie. He 
migh t need the advantage. ' "The 
ladder's right behind me." 

He climbed with hammer in 
teeth, and stretched his left hand 
from street level to grasp and neutralize the girl's right. Then, nervously fingering his weapon, he 
stared at her in the thin gray dawn. 

She was short and lean, except 
for roundnesses here and there. 
From her shapeless doeskin dress 
stretched slender legs that tapered 
to feet that were bare, tiny, and, 
like her hands, only two in number. 

Roddie was pleased. They were 
evenly matched as to members, and

that would make things easy when 
the time came. 

He looked into her face. It 
smiled at him, tanned and ruddy, 
with a full mouth and bright dark 
eyes that hid under long lashes 
when he looked too long. 

Startling, those wary eyes. Concealing. For a moment he felt a 
rush of fear, but she gave his hand 
a squeeze before twisting loose, and 
burst into sudden laughter. 

"Diapers!" she chortled, struggling to keep her voice low. "My 
big, strong, blond and blue-cyed 
hero goes into battle wearing 
diapers, and carrying only a hammer to fight with! You're the most 
unforgettable character I have ever 
known !" 

He'd passed inspection, then — 
so far. He expelled his withheld 
breath, and said, "I think you'll 
iind me a little odd, in some ways." 

"Oh, not at all," Ida replied 
quickly. "Different, yes, but I 
wouldn't say odd." 

WHEN they started down the 
street, she was nervous despite Roddie's assertion that he 
knew where the soldiers were posted. He wondered if she felt some 
of the doubt he'd tried to conceal, 
shared his visions of what the soldiers might do if they found him 
brazenly strolling with an Invader. 
They might not believe he was 
only questioning a prisoner. 

Every day, his friends were becoming more unpredictable. 



For that very reason, because he 
didn't know what precautions 
would do any good, he took a 
chance and walked openly to the 
bridge by the most direct route. In 
time this apparent assurance stilled 
Ida's fears, and she began to talk. 

Many of the things she said 
were beyond his experience and 
meaningless to him, but he did 
note with interest how effective the 
soldiers had been. 

"It's awful," Ida said. "So few 
young men arc left, so many casualties , . . . 

"But why do you — we — keep up 
the fight?" Roddic asked. "I mean, 
the soldiers will never leave the 
city; their purpose is to guard it 
and they can't leave, so they won't 
attack. Let them alone, and there'll 
be plenty of young men." 

"Well!" said Ida, sharply. "You 
need indoctrination ! Didn't they 
ever tell you that the city is our 
home, even if the stupid androids 
do keep us out? Don't you know 
how dependent we arc on these 
raids for all our tools and things?" 

She sounded suspicious. Roddic 
shot her a furtive, startled glance. 
But she wasn't standing off to fight 
him. On the contrary, she was too 
close for both comfort and combat. She bumped him hip and 
shoulder every few steps, and if he 
edged away, she followed. 

He went on with his questioning. 
"Why are you here? I mean, sure, 
the others arc after tools and 
things, but what's your purpose?"

Ida shrugged, "I'll admit no girl 
has ever done it before," she said, 
"but I thought I could help with 
the wounded. That's why I have no 
weapon." 

She hesitated, glanced covertly up 



concrete foundations on the northern end of the city. Thick fog over 
the water hid Alcatraz, but in-shors 
visibility wis better, and they could 
see the beginning of the bridge 
approach. 




at him, and went on with a tush 
of words. "It's (the lack of men, I 
guess. All the girls are kind of 
bored and hopeless, so I got this 
bright idea and stowed away on 
one. of the boats when it was dark 
and the fog had settled down. Do 
you think I was being silly?" 

"No, but you do seem a little 
purposeless." 

In silence they trudged through 
a vast area of charred wood and 



A stone rattled nearby. There 
was a clink of metal. Ida gasped, 
and clung to Roddie's arm. 

"Behind me!" he whispered 
urgently. "Get behind me and hold 
on!" 

He felt Ida's arms encircling his 
waist, her chin digging into his 
back below the left shoulder. Facing 'them, a hundred feet away, 
stood a soldier. He looked contemptuous, hostile. 



12 




 




"It's all right," Roddie said, his 
voice breaking. 

There was a long, sullen, heartstopping stare. Then the soldier 
turned and walked away. 

Ida's grip loosened, and he could 
feel her sag behind him. Roddie 
turned and held her. With eyes 
closed, she pressed cc-14 blue lips 
to his. He grimaced and turned 
away his head. 



Ida's response was quick. "Forgive me," she breathed, and 
slipped from his arms, but she held 
herself erect. "I was so scared. 'And 
then we've had no sleep, no food 
or water." 

Roddie was familiar witii these 
signs of weakness, proud of appearing to deny his own humiliating 
needs. 

"I guess you're not as strong as 



BRIDGE CROSSING 



13 



me," he said smugly. "I'll take care 
of you. Of course we can't sleep 
now, but I'll get food and waiter." 

Leaving her to follow, lie turned 
left to the ruins of a supermarket 
he had previously visited, demonstrating his superior strength by 
setting a pace Ida couldn't match. 
By the time she caught up with 
him, he had grubbed out a few 
cans of the special size that Molly 
always chose. Picking two that were 
neither dented, swollen, nor rusted, 
he smashed, an end of each with 
his hammer, and gave Ida her choice 
of strained spinach or squash. 

"Baby food!" she muttered. 
"Maybe it's just what we need, but 
to eat baby food with a man wearing a diaper . . . Tell me, Roddie, 
how did you happen to know where 
to find it?" 

"Well, this is the northern end 
of the city," he answered, shrugging. "I've been here before." 

"Why did the soldier let us go?" 

"This watch," he said, touching 
the radium dial. "It's a talisman." 

But Ida's eyes had widened, and 
the color was gone from her face. 
She was silent, too, except when 
asking him to fill his fast-emptied 
can with rain-water. She didn't 
finish her own portion, but lay 'back 
in the rubble with feet higher than 
her head, obviously trying to renew her strength. 

And when they resumed their 
walk, her sullen, fear-clouded face 
showed plainly that he'd given himself away. 



But to kill her now, before learning how she planned to cross the 
supposedly impassable bridge, 
seemed as purposeless and impulsive as Ida herself. Roddie didn't 
think, in any case, that her death 
would satisfy the soldiers. With 
new and useful information to 
offer, he might join them as an 
equal at last. But if his dalliance 
with this enemy seemed pointless, 
not even Molly's knitting needles 
could protect him. 

He was sure the soldiers must 
be tracking the mysterious emanations of his watch dial, and had 
trouble to keep from glancing over 
his shoulder at every step. But 
arrival at the bridge approach ended the need for this self-restraint. 
Here, difficult going demanded 
full attention. 

HE'D never gone as far as the 
bridge before, not having 
wanted to look as if he might be 
leaving the city. The approach was 
a jungle of concrete with an underbrush of reinforcing-steel that 
reached for the unwary with rusted spines. Frequently they had to 
balance on cracked girders, and inch 
over roadless spots high off the 
ground. 

Here Ida took the lead. When 
they got to where three approach 
roads made a clover-leaf, she led 
him down a side road and into a 
forest. 

Roddie stopped, and seized her 
arm. 



14 




 



"What are you trying to do?" he 
demanded. 

"I'm taking you with me," Ida 
said fi rmly. "Taking you where 
you belong!" 

"No!" he blurted, drawing his 
hammer. "I can't go, nor let you 
go. I belong here!" 

Ida gasped, twisted loose, and 
ran. Roddie ran after her. 

She wasn't so easily caught. Like 
a frightened doc, she dashed in and 
out among the trees, leaped to the 
bridge's underpinnings where they 
thrust rustedly from a cliff, and 
scrambled up the ramp. 

Roddie sighed and slowed down. 
The pavement ended just beyond 
the cable anchors. From there to 
the south tower, only an occasional 
dangling support wire showed 
where the actual bridge had been 
suspended. Ida was trapped. 

He could take his 'time. Let the 
soldiers come up, us they undoubtedly would, to finish the job . . . 

But Ida didn't seem to realize she 
was trapped. Without hesitation 
she dashed up the main left-hand 
suspension cable and ran along its 
curved steel surface. 

For a moment, R,oddie thought 
of letting her go, lotting her run 
up the ever-steepening catenary 
until — because there were no guardropes or handgrips — she simply 
fell. That would solve his problem. 

Except it wouldn't be his solution. Her death wouldn't prove him 
to his friends. 

He set out quickly, before Ida 



was lost to sight in the thick fog 
that billowed in straight from the 
ocean. At first he ran erect along 
the top of the yard-wide cylinder 
of twisted metal, but soon the curve 
steepened. He had to go on all 
fours, clinging palm and sole. 

Blood was on the cable where 
she'd passed. More blood stained, 
it when he'd followed. 

But because his friends knew 
neither pain nor fatigue, Roddie 
would admit none either. Nor 
would he give in to the fear that 
dizzied him at every downward 
look. He scrambled on like an automaton, watching only his holds, 
till he rammed Ida's rear with his 
head. 

SHE had stopped, trembling and 
gasping. Roddie clung just below her and looked dazedly around. 
There was nothing in sight but fog, 
pierced by the rapier of rusted wire 
supporting them. Neither end of 
it was in sight. 

Upward lay success, if death were 
not nearer on the cable. No soldier 
had ever come even this far, for 
soldiers, as he'd told Ida, never 
left the city, were not built to do 
so. But be was here; with luck, he 
could capitalize on the differences 
that had plagued him so long. 

"Go on!" he ordered hoarsely. 
"Move!" 

There was neither answer nor 
result. He broke off an end of 
loosened wire and jabbed her rear. 
Ida gasped and crawled on. 



BRIDGE CROSSING

Up and up they went, chilled, 
wet, bleeding, pain-racked, exhausted. Never had Roddie felt so 
thoroughly the defects of his peculiar non-mechanical construction. 

Without realizing it, ihe acquired 
a new purpose, a duty as compelling 
as that of any soldier ur firewatcher. He had to keep that trembling body of his alive, mount to 
the tall rust tower overhead. 

He climbed and he made Ida 
climb, till, at nightmare's end, the 
fog thinned and they came into 
clear, windswept air and clawed up 
the last hundred feet to sanctuary. 

They were completely spent. 
Without word or thought they crept 
within the tower, huddled together 
for warmth on its dank steel deck, 
and slept for several hours. 

RODDIE awoke as Ida finished 
struggling free of his unconscious grip. Limping, he joined her 
painful walk around the tower. 
From jts openings -they looked out 
on a strange and isolated world. 

To the north, where Ida seemed 
drawn as though by instinct, Mount 
Tamalpais reared its brushy head, 
a looming island above a billowy 
white sea of fog. To the south 
were the Twin Peaks, a pair of 
buttons on a cotton sheet. Eastward 
lay Mount Diablo, bald and brooding, tallest of the peaks and most 
forbidding. 

But westward over the ocean lay 
the land of gold — of all the kinds 
of gold there are, from brightest 



yellow to deepest orange. Only a 
small portion of the setting 51m 
glared above the fog-bank; the rest 
seemed to have 'been broken off and 
smeared around by a child in love 
with its color. 

Fascinated, Roddie stared for 
minutes, but turned when Ida 
showed no interest. She was intent 
on the tower itself. Following her 
eyes, Roddie saw his duty made 
suddenly clear. 

Easy to make out even in the 
fading light was die route by which 
Invaders could cross to the foot of 
this tower on the remaining ruins 
of the road, climb to where he now 
stood, and then descend the cable 
over the bridge's gap and catch the 
city unaware. Easy to estimate was 
the advantage of even this perilous 
route over things that scattered on 
the water and prevented a landing 
in strength. Easy to see was the 
need to kill Ida before she carried 
home this knowledge. 

Roddie took the hammer from 
his waist. 

"Don't! Oh, don't !*' Ida 
screamed. She burst into tears and 
covered her face with scratched and 
bloodied hands. 

Surprised, Roddie withheld the 
blow. He had wept, as^a child, and, 
weeping, had foe the first time 
learned he differed from his 
friends. Ida's tears disturbed him, 
bringing unhappy memories. 

"Why should you cry?" he 
asked comfortingly. ' 'You know 
your people will come back to 




 



avenge you and will destroy my 
friends." 

"But — but my people are your 
people, too," Ida wailed. "It's so 
senseless, now, after all our 
struggle to escape. Don't you see? 
Your friends are only machines, 
built by our ancestors. We are Men 
—and the city is ours, not theirs!" 

"It can't be," Roddie objected. 
"The city surely belongs to those 
who are superior, and my friends 
are superior to your people, even 
to me. Each of us has a purpose, 
though, while you Invaders seem 
to be aimless. Each of us helps preserve the city; you only try to rob 
and end it by destroying it. My people must be the true Men, because 
they're so much more rational than 
yours . . . And it isn't rational to 
let you escape." 

Ida had turned tip her tearstreaked face to stare at him. 

"Rational! What's rational about 
murdering a defenseless girl in cold 
blood? Don't you realize we're the 
same sort of being, we two? Don't 
— don't you remember how we've 
been with each other all day?" 

She paused. Roddie noticed that 
her eyes were dark and frightened, 
yet somehow soft, over scarlet 
cheeks. He had to look away. But 
he said nothing. 

"Never mind!" Ida said viciously. "You can't make me beg. Go 
ahead and kill — see if it proves 
you're superior. My people will take 
over the city regardless of you and 
me, and regardless of your jumping


jack friends, too! Men can accomplish anything!" 

SCORNFULLY she turned and 
looked toward the western twilight. It was Roddie's turn to stand 
and stare. 

"Purpose!" Ida Bung at him over 
her shoulder. "Logic! Women hear 
so much of that from men! You're 
a man, all right! Men always call 
it logic when they want to destroy ! 
Loyalty to your own sort, kindness, 
affection — all emotional, aren't 
they? Not a bit logical. Emotion 
is for creating, and it's so much 
more logical to destroy, isn't 
it?" 

She whirled back toward him, 
advancing as if she wanted to sink 
her teeth into his throat. "Go 
ahead. Get it over with — if you 
have the courage." 

It was hard for Roddie to look 
away from that wrath-crimsoned 
face, but it was even harder to keep 
staring into the blaze of her eyes. 
He compromised by gazing out an 
opening at the gathering dusk. He 
thought for a long time before he 
decided to tuck his hammer away. 

"It isn't reasonable to kill you 
now," he said. "Too dark. You 
can't possibly get down that halfruined manway tonight, so let's see 
how I feel in the morning." 

Ida began to weep again, and 
Roddie found it necessary to comfort her. 

And by morning he knew he was 
a Man. ■ — DAVE E>RYFOOS

MARS CHILD 



The colony on the red planet had no need 
for heroes. It wanted people who knew how 
to solve the problem of simple survival.

BY CYRIL JUDD 



CHAPTER ONli 

JIM KANDRO couldn't pace 
■the corridors, because there 
weren't any. The Colony's 
hospital was simply an extra room 
built onto the doctor's rammedearth house. They still called it 
"earth,"' though it was the rust-rcddencd soil of Mars. 

The narrow space between bed 
and wall cramped his restless legs; 
the monotonous motion wearied bis 
arm. But Jim stayed on, doggedly 
determined to see the thing through, 
rubbing his wife's back and whispering reassurances, as much to 
himself as to her. 

"Why don't you let me take over 
for a while?" the doctor suggested. 
Jim's usefulness was over now; the 
man was only ■communicating his 
own panic to his wife. "Go in the 
other room and lie down, or take a 
walk outside if you want to. Nothing's going to happen for a while 
yet" 



19 



"Doc . . ." The man's voice was 
rough with anxiety, but he held 
back the frantic questions. "Please, 
Tony," he said simply, "I'd rather 
stick around." He fixed a smile to 
his face as he bent over Polly again. 

Anna came in before Tony had 
quite decided to call her. It was a 
talent she seemed to have, one of 
the reasons why he had chosen her 
for his assistant. 

"1 think Jim needs a cup of coffee," he told her firmly. 

Kandro straightened up awkwardly. "All right, Doc." He was 
trying hard to be matter-of-fact. 
"You'll call me if anything — when 
there's news?" ■ 

"Of course he will." Anna's 
quick assurance forestalled Tony's 
exasperated retort. She put her hand 
on Kandro's arm, and smiled down 
at the woman on the bed. "Not 
much longer now, Polly," she said 
with quiet certainty. "Come on, 
Jim." 

As the door closed behind them, 
Tonyiturncd to his patient, and surprised a brief smile on her lips. 
"You mustn't mind," she explained, 
almost apologetically. "He's so worried." 

She had no breath for more. She 
twisted suddenly on the narrow bed 
and clutched at the air *ill Tony 
gave her his hand to squeeze on. 
Every other form of physical labor, 
he reflected unhappily, was made 
easier by the light gravity of Mars; 
but the labor of childbirth was 
eternally the same. And there was 



nothing he could do right now, except to offer her the reassurance of 
his presence. He stood and waited, 
gooseflesh cascading from the nape 
of his neck down his spine as she 
ground her teeth against the pain. 

When it was gone and she released his hand, he turned to the 
sterilizer for a fresh glove. One 
more examination, he decided . 
Something should be happening by 
now. 

He heard her deep inhalation behind him. 

"Anna's so nice," she sighed. 

HE HEARD the difference before he turned and saw it. 
Polly was lying back, completely relaxed, making the most of the time 
before the pain returned. 

"Yes, she is," Tony said. He 
dropped the glove on the table; another examination wasn't going to 
do any good, for her or for him. 
Quit the damned fiddling, he told 
himself. Sit and wait. You let that 
poor son-of-a-gun get you down. If 
she can wait, you can too. Be the 
doctor you would have been in 
Pittsburgh or Springfield- — any 
Springfield on Earth. So you're on 
Mars. So what? Sit and wait. 

He got a chair and put it next to 
the Fiigh bed, dropped his hand 
casually on the sheet where Polly 
could sec it, where she could grab 
it again when she wanted to. He 
leaned back and forced himself, 
muscle by unwilling muscle, to 
relax. 



20 




 



ii 

ON THE other side of the door, 
Jim raised his "coffee" cup 
for the fourth time to his lips, and 
for the fourth time put it down 
again untasted. 

"But what do you think, Anna?" 
he burst out. "How does it look to 
you? You'd know if there was anything . . . wrong." 

"It looks all right to me," she 
said again, gently. "It looks like a 
normal delivery." 

"But she's been — she started at 
six o'clock this morning ! Why 
should it take so loi\g?" 

"Sometimes it does. That doesn't 
mean there's anything wrong. It's 
hard work, that's all. It takes time." 
It was useless to tell him not to 
worry. She went over to the work 
counter that ran the length of the 
rectangular room. "I don't think 
it'll be much longer now, Jim. Do 
you want to .try and get some sleep 
while you wait? Or if you're going 
to stay up, could you give me a 
hand here?" She pulled out materials quickly. 

"Sure." He got up, still holding 
the cup as though he didn't even 
know it was in his hand. "I mean, 
I'll be glad to help." He let Anna 
relieve him of the cup, and accepted 
an alky torch, never wondering why 
she should choose to start a job at 
half -past midnight. 

"Look," he said desperately, "you 
would tell mc, wouldn't you, if it 
wasn't going right ? He — Tony 



wouldn't want to keep me from 
knowing, would he? She never got 
this far before, you know." 

"Believe me, Jim, if there were 
anything wrong, Tony would tell 
you. And I don't know any more 
than you do. You were in there 
longer than I was. Here, hold the 
flame down this way, will you?" 

For just a minute, he turned his 
attention to the work. "But why 
wouldn't he /til me anything?" 

"Because there was nothing to 
tell, I imagine." Even Anna's patience could wear thin. Deftly, she 
removed the torch from his hand 
before the down-turned flame could 
do any damage. 

Kandro wanted to yell: you don't 
know, none of you knoiv, twelve 
years we're been married and a man 
and a woman want kids, and none 
of you know how we want kids and 
all she does is get so sick you think 
she's dying and she never get this 
far before and you just don't 
know . . . 

He saw in Anna's eyes that he 
didn't have to say it, that she did 
understand. Her arms went out a 
little, and the big, rawboncd man 
flopped on his knees before the 
plain little woman and sobbed with 
his head awkwardly pillowed against 
her. 

iii 

AT 3:37 A. M„ Dr. Tony Hellman adjusted a tiny oxygen 
mask over the red button nose of a 



MARS CHILD 



21 



newborn infant, wiped it and 
wrapped it, and returned his attention to the mother. He reached for 
the buzzer that would summon 
Anna from the other room to help; 
but he didn't push it. Kandro was 
sure to come storming in with her, 
and Polly was too wakeful and excited as it was. Then, too, there was 
a certain perverse satisfaction in 
doing the whole job himself, even 
the messy wiping up operations that 
would be left to a student nurseback on Earth. 

WHEN he had finished, he 
overrode Polly's plan to stay 
awake and stare ait her baby. Hegave her a stiff shot of sedative to 
make certain, then decided to give 
her her OxEn pill for the next day 
as wcl I, hop ing she would sleep 
through till late morning. 

Only since the development of 
the magic pink pellets, containing 
the so-called "oxygen enzyme," had 
it been possible for most human 
beings to live a normal life on 
Mars. Before that, anyone who did 
not have the rare good luck to possess naturally Marsworthy lungs 
lived permanently in an oxygen 
mask. Now masks were needed only 
for babies too small -to tolerate the 
pill. 

The miracle enzyme made the air 
of Mars as useful to human lungs 
as the native atmosphere of Earth 
. . . always provided the human 
in question took his pill religiously 
every day. Let thirty hours go by 



without renewing the treatment, 
and he would be dying, within minutes, of anoxemia. 

Tony took a last look at the baby, 
made sure the tiny mask was properly adjusted, and checked the oxy 
tank for proper flow. Polly was already half -asleep. He went quietly 
past her bed, and opened the door 
to his living room. 

"Sh !" Anna turned from her 
workbench, her face warm and 
cheerful. She pointed to the bunk 
where Jim, fully dressed in tunic 
and sandboots, lay fast asleep. 
"Everything all right?" 
Tony nodded. "Damn sight better than I expected." After the 
glaring light of the hospital room, 
the quiet dark in here was good. 
More than that, Anna's untroubled 
presence served to dissolve all the 
nervous tension of the hours before. 
Suddenly too fatigued even to talk, 
he finished briefly, "Boy- — five 
pounds two ounces, Earth weight — 
good color — strong too." 

"Good." Anna returned her attention to the work. "I'll finish this 
up and then go sit with her. I'll call 
you if she needs anything." 
"What about him?" 
Anna glanced at Jim's sprawled 
figure. "He'll be all right." She 
smiled. "He can wait a few hours 
to meet his son." 

For just a moment more the 
doctor stood there, watching her, 
fascinated as always by her delicate 
art. A puff on the tube, a twist as it 
reddened in the flame, a spin against 



22 




 



an iron tool, another puff. AIL of it 
casual, seemingly" random, and then, 
somehow, there was a finished piece 
of work — part of* the intricate glass 
tubing always needed at the Lab, 
a fragile-looking piece of stemware 
for some new colonist's household, 
a precise hypodermic syringe for 
himself . 

He watched till his weary eyes refused the bright spot of light where 
the pale flame washed over the 
glowing glass. Then he stumbled 
into the adjoining bedroom and 
slept. 

CHAPTER TWO 

THE Lab was the cash drop of 
Sun Lake. Mars had a slight 
case of radioactivity, nothing you 
couldn't live with, but enough to 
enable Sun Lake City Colony to concentrate and isolate .radioisotopes 
■and radioactive ofganics for sale on 
Earth at better than competitive 
prices, even after the stiff -tariff for 
transport. 

The materials handled were only 
mildly dangerous, but it was the 
doctor's job to render them effectively not dangerous at all. Twice a 
day, before work started in the 
morning and again before quitting 
time, Tony geigered the whole 
place. On this precaution the whole 
community depended, not only for 
safeguarding their sole source of income, but for their very lives. Every 
adult member of the Colony did 
work at least indirectly connected 



with the Lab; all of them spent 
some time there. 

Among other things, it was the 
only building with a large enough 
room to serve for social functions. 
And it offered the only possible 
change from mud-colored walls, 
from isomorphic rooms, all jusr 
15x15, from cement floors and wall 
bunks. The Lab had everything th ■-■ 
other buildings lacked — steel framework and alumalloy wall sheathing; 
copper tubing and running hot 
water; built-in power outlets, Eardimade furniture; even .the blessings 
of an Earth-import air filtering system. 

The one kilometer walk out to 
the Lab in the early morning always infused the doctor with" a 
glowing sense of confidence and 
well-being. In a year on Mars, he 
had lost little of his first pleasure in 
the buoyancy afforded by the low 
gravity. Walking was effortless; 
and, in the thin air, an hour's sunlight was enovLgh to clear the 
night's chill from the open spaces. 
At noon, the sun would be too 
bright; in the evening, the cold 
would return as suddenly as it had 
departed. Now, in the first part of 
the morning, it was like a perfect 
autumn day on Earth. 

Behind him, in the houses that 
lined both sides of the colony's single curved street, people were dressing hurriedly, eating, making plans, 
getting ready for the day's work. 
Ahead, the shining blue walls of 
the Lab were set off against the 



MARS CHILD 



magnificent backdrop of Lacus Solis 
itself. The ancient sea bed was alive 
again with color as the early sun's 
rays glinted off millions of tiny 
particles, the salts and minerals of 
Mars deposited by long-dried waters 
in millcnia past. The clean lines of 
the new building against that sparkling expanse constituted at once a 
challenge and a reassurance — this is 
what man can do; ihere is everything 
he needs to do it with. 

// we can . . . a second chance for 
man, if we can learn how to use 
it. . . . 

Tony unlocked the storage cabinet 
built into the massive lead-lined 
door of the Lab. He took out his 
suit of protective armor — probably 
the only Earth- import wearing apparel ever bought and paid for by 
-he Colony — but before he got into 
it, he turned to look back just once 
at the little huddle of houses where, 
a few hours ago, Polly Kandro had 
affirmed her faith in Sun Lake's future in the most emphatic personal 
manner. 

THE solidity of the Lab was a 
disagreeable symbol of the 
Colony's present status; it was still 
ihe only decent structure Sun Lake 
had to show. Halfway up the almost imperceptible three kilometer 
slope from "canal" bed at his left to 
"sea" level at his right sat the 
Colony, lumpishly. Every building, 
like Tony's own home-and-hospiral, 
was tamped native dirt. The arc of 
dull rust-brown huts squatting close 



to the ground and close to each 
other presented to Tony a monotonous row of identical plastic-windowed backsides. 

Behind them, fields A, B, C, and 
D showed, even from the Lab, the 
work of Sun Lake's "mudkickers" 
— the agronomists who, using tools 
as ancient as the harrow and as 
modern as the mutation-creating 
particles that stream from a cyclotron, were changing Mars plants 
into things that could nourish an 
Earth animal, and changing Earth 
plants into things that could draw 
nourishment from the grudging 
Martian soil. 

Mutated bean plants whose ancestors had been a button -bearing 
Mars cactus dotted field A. Mutated 
cauliflowers — the size of apples, 
dark brown and still manufacturing 
in themselves too much potassium 
cyanide to be edible — darkened 
field B; another few plant-generations and they would be food for 
the Colony table, though tasting 
somewhat of the neutralized cyanide 
bitter almonds. 

Ten kilometers beyond the fields 
of bastard Earth-Mars vegetation, 
there had been beauty only recently 
— the fantastically eroded Rimrock 
Hills. Five months ago, however, 
the first pre-fab shacks had gone- up 
in the camp on the other side of the 
'hills. Three months ago the first 
furnace had been fired at Pittco 
Three: Pittsburgh Coal, Coke and 
Iron Company's Mars Metal Refining Plant Number Three. Now a 



24 




 



dirty shroud of yellow-stained 
smoke draped the peaks from dawn 
to dark. 

With a feeling of intense distaste, 
Tony started climbing into his suit 
of armor. A second chance jar 
map ... 

His own high-flown thoughts 
mocked him. Another chance lo do 
exactly as they had done on Earth. 
Already the clean air of Mars was 
thickening with the eructations of 
Earth's commerce. Nor was the 
camp beyond the hill a lone offender. Even Sun Lake, to survive 
at all, had to maintain a cash crop 
economy — and the Lab was the 
potentially deadly crop. 

Tony made sure that every flap 
on his suit was zippered and closed, 
and the last adjustments made on 
the helmet. He picked up the hand 
counter from the bottom of the 
compartment and worked the screw 
around to calibrate out Mars' naturally heavy background "noise." 
The needle eased to zero on the 
dial. Only then did he open the 
heavy door of the Lab itself and 
begin his slow trip of inspection 
through the building. 

ALT areas were well under the 
threshold of danger, as usual, 
except for a hot patch in the isotope 
room. Tony chalked a yellow line 
around the spot and marked the 
door of the room with a bright yellow cross. Finished, he headed 
straight for the clean-up room and 
checked the condition of the ex


terior of his suit against the bigger 
stationary radiation counter that 
was kept there. 

Not until he was sure he -hadn't 
picked up anything on gloves or 
boots did he remove his suit and 
dump it down the chute for routine 
de-radiation. He hated to take time 
for 'the rest of the procedure today: 
he had to check with the men who 
were working in the hot spot; 'hehad to -get back to the hospital to 
see Polly; he had a patient, Joan 
Radcliff, who worried him badly. 
What was more, he'd slept too late 
to eat breakfast at the communal 
table shared by most unmarried 
Colony members; he hadn't even 
had "coffee" — and he missed it. Butafter the number of times he'd 
nagged the others about skimping 
on safety precautions, he couldn't 
pass up any of them himself. 

He stripped and dumped his 
clothes down another chute, sandscrubbed himself, and' holding his 
breath, walked through the stinking 
alcohol spray. Methyl alcohol, 
cheaper and easier to produce in the 
Lab than water, and sand for soap 
made bathing an ordeal instead of 
the pleasant ritual it had been on 
Earth. 

Tony moved fast, but by the time 
he had put on a fresh tunic and 
boots and emerged into the central 
hall, the Lab was already full of 
people getting set for the day's 
work He edged past a knot of busy 
conversationalists in the corridor. 

"Hey, Doc . . 



MARS CHILD 



25 



He paused, and that was his undoing. 

"How's Polly? Tony, hold on — 
how's the baby? Are they all right? 
— Doc, wait a minute. Did everything go all right? — Where are 
they? — What is it . . .?" 




E ANSWERED the same ques. tions a dozen times. It seemed 



that half the population of Sun 
Lake was in the corridor with him, 
and they all wanted to know the 
same thing. Finally, despairing of 
getting through until he had satisfied -them all, Tony climbed up on a 
chair and addressed the crowd. 

"Five pounds, two ounces, Earth 
weight — a boy — wrigglingcst baby 
I ever saw. Plenty lively, and he 
looks just like his old man. What 
else do you want to know?" 

"How's Polly?" 

"Fine. So's Jim." The hoary joke 
got its inevitable laugh. 

Then one of the chemists said, 
"I make a motion for a birthday 
present. Let's build that other 
room onto the Kandro house right 
now." 

It was an offer that had been 
made months before, and that 
Polly, hesitant and slightly superstitious, had refused. "There'll be 
time enough after the baby's 
born," she had told them, and 
stuck to it. 

Tony knew why; knew about the 
first time, eleven years before, when 
she had carried a child for seven 
months, and then had to pack away 



all the things she had lovingly collected for its birth. They had stayed 
in their cartons for four more years, 
and two more miscarriages, before 
she gave them tearfully to a luckier 
woman. 

"When is she going home, Doc?" 
one of the electronics men asked. 
"How much time have we got?" 

"I don't know. Maybe tomorrow 
morning," Tony told them. "She's 
in pretty good shape. It's just a 
matter of where she'll be most comfortable. I don't imagine she'll want 
to stay in the hospital very 
long . . . After all, it's not exactly 
designed for luxurious convalescence." They were all familiar with 
the crowded little room; he waited 
for a dutiful laugh to die down, 
and added, "I think tomorrow will 
be about right . . . not later than 
the day after." 

"We better get started then," 
Mimi Jonathan, the pert blackhaired Lab administrator, spoke up. 
"Suppose I make up some work 
parties, and we get things going?" 

She produced a pencil and paper 
and began taking down the names 
and abilities of everyone whose Lab 
work was not too pressing. Two 
groups of volunteers left promptly, 
to collect soil from the old "canal" 
bottom, and to set up the frames 
for ramming. Others would have to 
stay in the Lab to set up the machinery for work on the synthetics 
that would paint the new room, 
build the new furniture, and clothe 
the new baby. While Mimi plunged 



26 




 



into the complexities of reassigning work space and job time, the 
doctor managed to get away from 
the enthusiastic crowd. 

He made his way to the isotopes 
room, and was happy to find Sam 
Flexner, the chemist in charge, 
waiting for him at the yellowchalked door, Apparently his harping on safety rules had penetrated 
in at least one case ; Sam knew 
enough to stay on the spot even in 
the midst of the sudden excitement 
over the baby. 

TONY opened the door and 
pointed out the ragged chalked 
circle on the floor. "Any idea what 
it is?" 

"We were running some radiophosphorus," Sam said doubtfully. 
"But there was no trouble on the 
run. Must be spillage," The chemist 
had a young open face, and Tony 
liked him. He began to fill in the 
necessary report. 

"What reason ?" Spillage was 
unusual. 

"It's a bigger order than we 
usually handle — must have been a 
hun dred kilograms. ' ' Sam looked 
up sharply. "It was all right yesterday, wasn't it? The afternoon 
checkup ?" 

Tony nodded. 

"Then it must have been at closing. I . . . well, I left a few minutes 
early yesterday. Figured the boys 
could close up all right, but I guess 
one of them took a lazy man's load 
in his tote box . . . filled it up too 



high to save himself a trip. I'll 
check on it and tell them in a nice 
way, all right?" 

"That should do it. But I better 
have a look at the checkout tubes." 

Sam brought over a tray of tubes 
resting in numbered grooves. He 
was wearing one like diem pinned 
to his own lapel. The contents of 
the tubes was its normal dirty 
white. Purple would have meant 
"too close to hot stuff too long." 

"Okay," said Tony, checking his 
form. "That hot spot there, I think 
you'd better -chisel it out and get 
one of the suppliers to take it- way 
out and dump it." 

"Old Learoyd was here with a 
load of vanadium dirt. He'll do it 
when he leaves for Pittco." 

"Fine. Get it done. And tell Learoyd to put the stuff in the back of 
his rig. I don't think you could kill 
any of those old boys with anything 
subtler than a meat ax, but I 
wouldn't want him to sit next to it 
for a ten-hour trip." He dated and 
timed off the form. "That's that. 
Only you better stick around till 
close-up after this." He smiled and 
put a stop to die young chemist's 
attempt at explanation. "How's 
Verna, anyhow? Something better 
happen soon, if it's going to make 
all this trouble." 

SAM grinned back, "You may 
hear something soon," he admitted. "But please don't— uh — " 

"Doctors don't gossip," Tony 
said. "One thing about this place," 



MARS CHILD 



27 




he added, "we can't help making 
history every time we turn around. 
Have a baby, and it's the first baby; 
have another baby, and it's the first 
girl born; slice out an appendix, 
and it's the first abdominal surgery. 
Let's see — you and Verna will be 
:he first marriage -between a drop-in 
chemical engineer and a share-holding agronomist — if she'll have you/' 

"Sounds like one of those 
weather records," complained Sam. 
"The coldest 3.00 P.M. reading at 
ihe corner of Spruce and Juice on a 
January 16th since 2L07." 

"It's your place in history," 
Tony assured him. "We'll all be 
footnotes. I'll see you this afternoon." 



CHAPTER THREE 

TONY stepped out with springs 
in his knees, and, feeling the 
waxing heat of the morning, threw 
back the hood of his parka. The 
marvelous clear air of an hour 
earlier was fast disappearing, is the 
mineral trash that covered Mais* 
surface began to heat and roil the 
atmosphere. He looked off toward 
the Rimrock Hills, mourning their 
vanished beauty; then he stopped 
in surprise, squinting at: the enigmatic black bugs crawling back and 
forth within the shadow of the 
hills. 

He stood there, watching, as the 
seemingly random pattern of mo


28 




 



tion trended gradually in the direction of the Colony. 

Who would be out on the desert 
afoot? He stopped and shielded his 
eyes. There were about twenty of 
them, and they were humped with 
—carbines and oxy masks. 

The military ! 

But why? There'd never been a 
"visit from Commissioner Bell's little 
antercolony police force before; 
never been any occasion for it. Each 
colony handled its own internal 
policing. 

It was a year now since Bell's 
boys had been out for anything except routine administrative work, 
Such as guard mount over the 
rocket; the last time was when an 



ace foundryman for Mars Machine 
Tool was rightly suspected of committing mayhem on a Marsport 
shopkeeper. Mars Machine Tool's 
colony administration insisted on 
being unimpressed by the evidence 
and refused to surrender him to 
Marsport. Bell's boys had simply 
walked in and taken him away for 
ihis trial and conviction. 

But Sun Lakers weren't given to 
mayhem. 

Tony headed back for the Lab as 
the crooked trail of the soldiers 
straightened out into a beellne for 
the same place. He had his patients, 
but he was also a member of the 

Colony Council and this looked like 
Council business. 



MARS CHILD

In the Lab he went straight to 
the front office and asked Mimi: 
"Did Harve ever get that recorder 
put together?" 

"Last week," she said. "It's been 
a blessing too. Why?" 

"I think Bell's boys are paying us 
a call." He told her what he'd seen 
outside. "It might be useful to have 
a record of it." 

Mimi nodded thoughtfully, and 
flipped a lever at the side of her 
desk. "That'll register anywhere in 
the office," she explained. "I'm a 
pacer — Harve set it up so I could 
walk all over the office while I 
talk, and still have it record." 

Sam Flexner was also there. He 
put down a completed report form 
on the spillage in his department to 
ask: "What do they want?" 

"I don't know," Tony told him. 
"But I think we'd better put in an 
intercom call for Joe Gracey to 
come on out here. He ought to be 
tending his seedling in C Area. 
Phone the South End to send a 
runner and get him out here on the 
double." 

Gracey was the senior agronomist, and, like Mimi and Tony, a 
member of the Colony Council. The 
fourth member, and most recent 
addition, was Nick Cantrella; in 
only six months' time since his arrival at Sun Lake, Nick had risen 
from junior setup man to bossing 
all maintenance and procurement 
for the Lab. At the moment he 
was home with a nasty chemical 
burn on his arm. It wasn't really 



so bad that he couldn't be called in 
for an emergency, but Tony hesitated to do so, and he noticed that 
Mimi didn't suggest it either. Nick 
had a red-hot temper and practically 
no inhibitions. 

"No," the doctor said to the 
questioners that began to press 
around him, ' ' I don ' t think we 
ought (o go out and meet them. 
Better just go ahead and work and 
get the new room for the Kandros 
put together. Flexner, will you stick 
around ? It may be some damn 
thing or other about our atomics — 
some technical precaution we may 
have missed." 

"No, sir," said another man emphatically. It was O'Donnell, who 
had ditched a law career to become 
a sweeper and then a maintenance 
man and_ then a good jury-rig 
physicist. It was his job to see that 
no daylight showed between the 
Colony's atomics practice and thclaw. 

"Hmp," said the doctor. "You 
stick around too." 

THERE was a thudding on the 
door and a self-conscious calling of an archaic formula: "Open 
in the name of the law!" 

The delegation was a halfplatoon of soldiers with their 
carbines and cumbersome oxygen 
masks and tanks — a choice bit of 
military conservatism, since a 
pocketful of OxEn pills weighed a 
hundredth as much and would keep 
them alive a hundred times longer. 



30 




 



There were two civilians and an 
officer — Lieutenant Ed Nealey. 

Tony was relieved to see him; 
they were fellow -members of a subscription club that split the heavy 
postage on Earthside scientific periodicals, and Tony knew Nealey to 
be a conscientious and level-headed 
young career officer. 

The doctor was extending his 
hand to Nealey when he remembered his protocol. One of the 
Civilians was unknown to him, but 
the other was Hamilton Bell, Commissioner of Interplanetary Affairs. 

"I'm Tony Hellman, Commissioner," he said. "I don't know if 
you remember me. I'm the doctor 
here and a member of our Colony's 
Council." 

The commissioner was a. small 
man, tending somewhat to pompous 
frailty. He looked like .the kind of 
person rumor made him out to be; 
a never very important functionary 
who got the dreary Mars post when 
a very ordinary graft ring of which 
he was a prominent member was 
"exposed." The exposure followed 
only reasonably quickly on the heels 

of his bolt f rom the Insurantist 
Senate minority in the Panamerican World Federation. In the interval between the news accounts of 
Bell's political switch, and the 
spectacular news stories of graft 
corruption in which he was involved, there had been just time for 
the minority to become a majority . . . 

"Can you speak for the Colony?" 



he asked abruptly, ignoring Tony's 
hand. 

THE doctor cast a bewildered 
look at Lt. Nealey, whose eyes 
were front and whose face was set. 
Tony noticed he carried in a canvas 
scabbard the disassembled dipole 
and handle of an electronic "Bloodhound." 

"I'm a council member," Tony 
said. "So is Miss Jonathan here. 
Another council member's ill and 
the third is on his way. The two of 
us can speak for the Colony. Now, 
what can we do for you?" 

"It's a police matter. Do you 
care to make a statement before I 
have to drag the situation out into 
the open?" 

"Let me take it," muttered 
O'Donnell. Tony nodded. The 
lawyer- turned -physicist firmly told 
the commissioner: "I want to remind you that we are a chartered 
colony, and, under the charter, arc 
entitled to police ourselves. And I 
also want to say that we are not 
going to respond to any fishing expeditions until we hear what the 
complaint is." 

"Suit yourself," grunted the commissioner. "But you're not selfpolicing when you steal from another colony. Mr. Brenner, tell your 
story." 

Eyes swiveled to the other 
civilian, Brenner of Brenner Pharmaceuticals. So that, thought Tony, 
is what a tr'illionaire looks like. 
Younger than anyone could reason

ably expect, and somehow looking 
comfortably conservative even in a 
parka of orange-red mutation mink. 
The- best of food, plenty of rest, 
and the most careful attention to his 
bodily needs were combining to 
cover the prominent bones of his 
face with deceptive pads of soft 
flesh; but he still wore the countenance of a lean and questing man: 
a pc rplcxing expression of bland 
good humor or of permanent inner 
amusement. 

Brenner shrugged and smiled a 
little uncomfortably. "I had no 
choice. Doctor," he said. "A hundred kilos of my marcaine — bulk 
micron dust, you understand — was 
stolen yesterday." 

SOMEBODY gasped. A hundred 
kilograms of marcaine, principal product of Brenner's works, 
was a small fortune on Mars — and 
a large fortune on Earth, if it could 
be diverted from medical use and 
channeled into one of the innumerable pipelines to addicts. 

"Naturally I reported it," Brenner explained. "And of course 
Commissioner Bell had to order a 
Bloodhound search. It brought us 
here." 

"Ed," "Tony appealed to the 
grim-faced lieutenant, "did you operate the Bloodhound? Will you 
give me your personal word that 
it led to the Colony?" 

"Answer him, Lieutenant," Bell 
ordered. 

"I'm sorry to . . . Dr. Hellman," 



Nealey saitl stiffly. "I checked the 
machine three times, myself. Strong 
scent from Brenner's storeroom to 
the Rimrocks, then some confusion 
in the Rimrock caves, and a weakening scent from the Rimrocks to here. 
It doesn't actually stand up all the 
way here, but it doesn't go anywhere else. That's definite." 

" 'Please, Dr. Hellman,*' said 
Brenner kindly. "You needn't look 
so stricken. All it means is that 
there's a rotten apple in your barrel. 
That happens." 

Gracey hurried in, a spindleshanked ex -professor of low-temperature agronomy from Nome 
University. He addressed himself 
directly to Brenner: "What are you 
doing here?" 

"Mr. Brenner has sworn out an 
intercolony complaint of grand 
theft," said the commissioner. 
"You're Gracey? You needn't waste 
your breath trying to blacken Mr. 
Brenner's character. He's already 
informed me that there was a disagreement between you which 
you've taken to heart." His meager 
smile showed that what he meant 
was "become a little cracked over." 

"He hasn't got any character to 
blacken," growled the agronomist. 
"He tried to get me to breed marcaine weeds for higher production 
of his he II -dust and I wanted to 
know why. Wasn't that naive of 
mc? I checked on Earth and 1 found 
out that maybe ten per cent of his 
marcaine goes into medical hands 
and the rest — " 



32 




 



The commissioner shut him up 
with a .decisive: "That's enough. I 
will not listen to random accusations 
based on newspaper gossip. I don't 
doubt til at after marcainc arrives 
on Earth some of it is diverted. The 
world has its weak-willed people. 
But Mr. Brenner is a responsible 
manufacturer and you people . . . 
I respect your ideals but I'm afraid 
I can't say much for your performance. The business of Mars is 
business. And a major theft from 
one of our leading industrial 
colonies is very serious indeed." 

"Gentlemen," said Brenner, "I 
can't ignore it. I'd like to, simply to 
spare the unpleasantness, but the 
amount involved is too important 
financially. And there's always the 
danger that some quantity might get 
into illegal channels." 

GRACEY snarled, looked as 
though he wanted to spit on 
the immaculate floor of the Lab. 

"What exactly do you intend to 
do?" Tony asked hastily, anxious 
to forestall an eruption from the 
irritable agronomist. 

"It should be quite clear by now," 
Bell replied, "that it is my duty to 
conduct a search of these premises." 

"You'll keep your grabbing little 
hands off our equipment!" Unexpectedly, it was Flexner who exploded. "It's all nonsense, and you 
know it. What would we steal from 
that drug peddler?" 

Brenner? quiet laugh rasped 
into the appalled silence that fol


lowed. Hcxncr, enraged, took just 
one belligerent step toward the trillionaire and the commissioner. 

"Sergeant!" barked Lieutenant 
Nealey, and a noncom, unslinging 
his carbine like an automaton, 
aimed from the hip at the chemist. 
Flexner stopped in his tracks, redfaced with anger, and said bitterly: 
"So he can make the damned stuff 
and welcome, but all hell breaks 
loose if somebody hooks it." 

"For the last time — " began Bell, 
exasperatedly, and then interrupted 
himself. He drew a paper from his 
parka and handed it to Tony. "The 
warrant," he said shortly. 

Tony passed it to O'Donnell and 
there was a long, foot-tapping 
minute while the ex-lawycr studied 
the document. 

At last O'Donnell said, "According to this, you plan to open 
our shipping crates and break into 
our process ovens. Is that correct?" 
He was pale with anger and worry. 

"Correct," said the commissioner, 
while Brenner shrugged helplessly. 
"Marcainc could, of course, be 
concealed from the Bloodhound in 
lead-insulated containers." 

"Then you are aware," said Tony, 
"that we manufacture radioactive 
materials?" 

"I am." 

"And you realize that there are 
certain procedures required by law 
for the handling of such materials?" 

"Doctor Hcllman! Has it slipped 
your mind that I represent the law 
you're speaking of?" 



MARS CHILD 



33 



"Not at all." Tony was determined not to lose his temper. 
"But I could hardly expect you to 
carry in your mind all the time the 
innumerable petty details that must 
come under your administration. 
And at happens that / represent, 
here in the Colony, the observance 
of the laws under which our radioactives license was granted. I think 
that as chief radiological monitor 
for the Colony, I should be permitted to accompany your men in any 
search. 

"That's out of the question." The 
commissioner dismissed the request 
impatiently. "The license you spoke 
of is, as we both know, a gradc-B 
atomics license, permitting you to 
handle only materials well below 
the safety level, so I see no 
reason for any unnecessary fuss. 
Lieutenant . . .** 

" 'Just a minute, please, Commissioner," Tony interrupted frantically. It was perfectly true that as 
the direct representative on Mars 
of the Panamerican World Federation, Bell was judge, jury, and corner cop, all ro.led into one. Redress 
was as far away as Earth, and the 
road to Earth was the rocket from 
which Bell had the power to bar 
them. 

"Don't you realize," Tony pleaded, "that our materials stay below 
the safety level only because we 
have a well-established, monitoring 
procedure? If you insist on breaking into process ovens and opening 
crates without my supervision, Sun 



Lake cannot assume responsibility 
for any dangerous radioactivity." 

"I understand that, Doctor," 
Bell answered crisply. "Any handling of radioactives in fliy presence 
is obviously done on my responsibility, not yours. The commission, 
oddly enough, is supplied with its 
own monitors. I do not believe we 
will require your assistance. Carry 
on, Lieutenant." 

NEALEY took a reluctant step 
forward. Choking back his 
anger, Tony said flatly: "In my 
opinion you are exceeding your authority. You* men will interfere 
with our processing and break open 
our shipment crates. Our machinery 
is so delicately adjusted that any 
kind of handling by untrained people could easily destroy it. And 
we've spent the last month packing 
our outgoing shipments for the next 
rocket. You know what the law is 
for packing radioactives. If you 
broke open our shipments, the 
rocket would be here and gone before we had the stuff decontaminated and repacked. It would be 
ruinous for the Colony." 

He saw out of the corner of his 
eye that O'Donnell was unwillingly shaking his head. Bell was the 
law on Mars. And Bell wasn't even 
bothering to answer. 

"At least give us a chance to look 
into it," urged the doctor. "Maybe 
we have got a bad apple. We'll find 
fliim if we do. You can't wreck us 
just on suspicion!" 



34 




 



"More than suspicion is involved 
here," said Bell. "The findings of 
the Ground Tracing Device, M-27, 
known as the Bloodhound, when 
operated by a qualified commissioned officer, are accepted as completely legal evidence in all authorized world courts." 

They watched bleakly as the lieutenant began to assemble the dipole, 
handle, power pack and meters of 
the Bloodhound. 

"I have a suggestion," said Brenner. "Under Tide Fifteen of the Interplanetary Affairs Act — " 

"No," said O'Donnell. "We 
don't want it." 

Brenner said persuasively, "If 
you're clean, there's nothing to 
worry about." 

"Title Fifteen was never meant 
to be applicable to a case like this," 
O'Donnell crossfired. "It's one of 
those shotgun laws, like a conspiracy count — " 

"That's enough," said the commissioner. "You can't have it both 
ways. As long as Mr. Brenner's 
willing, this is your notice; I'll confirm it in writing. Under Title Fifteen of the Interplanetary Affairs 
Act, I advise the Sun Lake Colony 
that you have until the next Shipment Day to produce the marcaine 
thief and the stolen marcaine or 
evidence of its disposal. If you fail 
to do so, I will instruct the military 
to seal off Sun Lake Colony and 
a suitable surrounding area for a period of six months so that a 
thorough search can be conducted. 



Lieutenant, move your men out of 
here." 

NEALEY snapped the halfplatoon to attention and 
marched them through the Lab 
door. The unmilitary figures of the 
commissioner and the tall, angular 
drug maker followed them. 

O'Donnell's face was grim. "It 
was written in the old days of one 
ship a year and never revised," he 
said. " 'Scaled off' means just that 
— nothing and nobody in, nothing 
and nobody out." 

"But we're geared for four ships 
a year," said Flexner complainingly. 
"Shipment Day's only three weeks 
off. Rocket's due in ten days, two 
days unloading, one week overhaul 
and off she goes. We'd miss the 
next two rockets !" 

"We^d t/tiss the next two 
rockets!" Tony repeated, dazed. 

"Half a year without shipments 
coming in, half a year without 
goods going out!" 

"He's trying to strangle us." 
"It can't be legal," objected 
Hexner. 

"It is. By the time it could be 
changed, the Colony'd be dead anyway." 

"Even if we pulled through, 
we'd be poison to Earthside buyers — shipments arriving there half 
a year late." 

"He's trying to strangle us," 
O'Donnell insisted doggedly. 

"How many OxEn pills have we 
got?"

"What's Bell's angle? What's 
Brenner out for?" 

"Bell's crooked. Everybody 
know's that." 

"That's why they sent him to 
Mars." 

"But what's his angle?" 

Tony was still a doctor. To no 
one in particular he muttered, "I've 
got to check on the baby," and 
started out again on -the road from 
the Lab to the huts with 'the spring 
gone from his knees. 

CHAPTER FOUR 

THE living room was empty. 
Someone had tidied it, straightened the wall bunk where Jim had 
slept, and cleaned up the dirty 
dishes. Anna's long work-counter 
was bare, all the tools and materials 
stored away now in cupboards underneath. That alone made the room 
look deserted. 

Tony wouldn't talk to the women 
about the commissioner and his 
trap. He'd try not to think about It; 
he'd tell himself it would work out 
somehow in the three weeks of 
grace they had — 

The door to the hospital was 
open, but no sounds came from the 
other .side. Polly was asleep then, 
and Anna had gone out. 

Tony drew a cup of water from 
the tap on the plastic keg, and set 
it to boil on the stove with a pinch 
of "coffee" makings — the ground, 
dried husks of a cactuslike plant 
that grew in some abundance on the 

36 



desert. At its best the stuff had approximately the flavor of a five-dayold brew of Earth-import brick 
coffee, made double strength to start 
with and many times reheated. It 
did contain a substance resembling 
caffein, but to Tony it often seemed 
the greatest single drawback to human life on Mars. 

Automatically he checked the 
time; the stuff was completely nn'drinkable if it brewed even a fraction of a minute too long. Before he 
put any food on to cook, he stepped 
into the hospital half of his hut for 
a look at Polly. 

"Well!" 

"Hello, Tony." Anna barely 
looked up 'to acknowledge his presence. She had moved the baby's 
basket next to Polly's bed and was 
bending over, peering into it. 

"We were watching the baby," 
she unnecessarily told him, and 
promptly returned to that fascinating occupation. 

"Just what is there to watch so 
hard?" the doctor demanded. 

"He's . . ." Anna finally transferred her attention; she made a 
helpless little gesture and smiled 
with an irritating air of mystery. 
"He's very interesting," she said 
finally. 

"Women!" Tony exploded. "Sit 
for hours watching a baby sleep!" 

"But he's not sleeping," Anna 
protested. 

"He's hardly slept all morning," 
Polly added proudly. "I've never 
seen such a lively baby!" 


 



"And how would you know what 
he was doing 'all .morning' ? When 
I left here you were asleep yourself, 
and Anna -was all ready to go home 
and do likewise. Where's Jim?" 

He wanted to go to work, 
Anna explained. "He was — embarrassed, I guess, about staying out. I 
told him I'd stay. I wasn't really 
sleepy anyhow." 

< * "\70U weren' t sleepy ? After 
1 twenty-six hours awake?" He 
tried hard to be stern. "So you sent 
Jim off to work to give him a 
chance to brag about his baby. You 
weren't sleepy, and neither was 
Polly, and strangely enough, neither 
was the newcomer here! Well, as of 
now, all three of you are just too 
sleepy to stay awake, you understand?" 

Purposefully, he moved the basket to the far side of the room. 
What they said was true, he noticed; young Kandro "was wideawake and kicking, apparently perfectly content. Not even trying. 
Strange behavior for a newborn. 

"Come on, Anna, clear out." He 
put the baby down, and turned to 
Polly. "I ll give you ten minutes to 
get to sleep before I stuff some 
more sedative into you," he informed her. "Didn't anybody ever 
tell you you're supposed to be tired 
now?" 

"All right." Polly refused to be 
ruffled. "He's an awfully nice baby, 
Tony." She settled herself more 
comfortably under the thin cover. 



and was asleep almost before they 
left the room. 

"Now go on home," Tony told 
Anna. "I'm going to make myself 
some breakfast. Wait a minute. Did 
you eat anything?" 

"I did, thanks." Abruptly she 
turned toward him, and made a 
conscious effort at concentration . 
The abstracted look left her eyes 
and she was brisk and alert as 
usual. "What about Polly? Don't 
you have to go out again ? Somebody should be here." 

"I'll get hold of Gladys when I 
leave. Don't worry about it." 

"All right." She smiled at his 
impatient tone. "You don't have to 
push me. I'll go." She picked up the 
heavy parka she had worn on her 
way over there, in the early morning hours the day before. At the 
door, she turned back. "You're still 
coming over for dinner tomorrow 
night?" 

"You couldn't keep me away," he 
assured her. 

She came back into the room, 
and took a ration slip from the 
drawer where Tony kept them. 
"You pay in advance, you see," she 
added, smiling. 

"And well worth it." Tony held 
the door for her, a habit he never 
quite lost even in the atmosphere of 
determined sexual equality that pervaded the Colony. Not until she 
was gon e did he rem ember the 
coffee he'd started. 

It was ruined, of course, and now 
he'd have to do without it. Water 



MARS CHILD

was too scarce, still, to waste because of carelessness. But coffee or 
no, 'he was hungry. He found a dish 
of barley gruel, left over from a 
lunch he'd cooked for himself two 
days ago, heated it, and spooned it 
down hastily. Then, with a final 
check to make sure Polly was really 
asleep, he set out for the .Poroskys' 
house to find Gladys. 

At fourteen, Gladys was the oldest child in the Colony — none of 
the adult members were over thirtyfive years — and her status was 
halfway between that of a full 
working member and the errandgirl position her younger sister occupied. She was old enough to asssist 
almost anybody at anything, still 
too young to take full responsibility for a job. Now, Tony found, she 
was over at the Radcliff's, sitting 
with Joan. It was his next stop anyhow. 



IF THEY did have to leave Mars, 
it would have at least one good 
effect: the life of Joan Radcliff 
would be saved. But, the doctor reflected, she'd die of a broken heart 
as surely as she was dying on Mars 
of . . . whatever it was. His star 
patient, the thin, intense girl lived 
Only for the success of the colony 
on Mars. And life on Mars was killing her. 

When he knew what she had, 
maybe, Tony would know how to 
cure it. Meanwhile, all he could 



do was make a faithful record of 
its symptoms and try out treatments 
till he found one that would work. 
Or until he was sure none of them 
worked . 

It was like an allergy and it was 
like heart disease and it was like 
fungus infection where you couldn't 
put your finger on the parasite. The 
biochem boys back on Earth would 
lick it some day as they had licked 
dozens of others, but right now 
Tony didn't even 'have a name to 
tag it by. 

Joan came down with it two days 
after she and her husband, Hank, 
arrived on the shuttle rocket. If the 
doctor didn't find some relief for 
her soon, it looked as though she 
would have to go back on the next 
one. 

Tony bit hard on the stem of 
his empty pipe, slipped it into a 
pocket, and walked into the bedroom of the Radcliff house. 

"How's it going?" He put his 
bag on the table and sat down on 
the edge of Joan's bunk. 

"Not so good." She had to work 
for a smile; a good colonist is always cheerful. "I just can't seem 
to get settled. It's as if the bed 
was fut I of stale cracker crumbs 
and broken shells ..." 

She began to cough, short dry 
barks that rattled her thin body, 
feather-light on Mars, against the 
bed. 

Cracker crumbs and sea shells! 
Sometimes it seemed that the 
damned condition reached her 



33 




 



mind too. It -was hard to distinguish 
between the delirium of fever, the 
depression of fatigue and confinement, the distortions of mental 
disease. 

The spasm had passed. She battled the itch to cough again and 
counter- irritate her raw, constricted 
throat. Tony, watching, knew the 
guts it took. He had told her that 
a cough can be controlled, that she 
should control it because the spasms 
endangered her already overtaxed 
heart. But even before he warned 
her, she was fighting: a good colonist guarded her health; it was a 
colony asset. 

Everything for the Colony. And 
for Henry, her husband. Joan was 
one of those thin, intense young 
people who give their lunch money 
to Causes. It had taken a lot of 
skipped lunches to get her and 
Henry to Mars as shareholders, 
Tony realized But she could never 
have been satisfied with less — the 
non-voting position of "drop-in," 
for instance. She had to identify 
herself with a heroic unpopular abstraction, or life wasn't worth living. 

Tony had more than a touch of 
it himself. All of them in the Colony did. But the doctor doubted 
that he had enough of it to fight 
against the brief, delusive relief of 
a coughing fit in order to get well 
imperceptibly sooner and go back 
to work for the Colony. 

// she got well. 

Tony opened his little black bag 



ritually, his mind flashing back to 
the intern days when he had perfected the gesture: the grave and 
kindly set of face, the brooding 
moment of introspection over the 
open mouth of the learned tool 
chest. Too bad; too bad you 
couldn't cut whatever it was out of 
her suffering body and bury it; or 
bore a hole in her and let the poison 
run down a drain. There was no 
tool waiting for him in the open 
bag with which to stop the girl's 
own chemistry from fighting against 
her flesh. 

JOAN whispered, '"Got some 
magic in there foi, me?" A 
good colonist is always cheerful; the 
great days are ahead. 

"Middling magic, anyhow." He 
put the thermometer in her dry 
mouth, and peeled back the blanket. 
There were new red bumps on her 
arms and legs; that was one phase 
of it he could treat. He smoothed 
on ointment, and changed the dressings on the old puffy sore spots. 

"That's good," she whispered 
gratefully as he took the thermometer from her mouth. "So cool!" 
Her temperature was up another 
two-tenths over yesterday's 101.3 
And the thermometer was not even 
moist. 

Another injection, then. He 
hated to use them, as long as he 
wasn't sure of the nature of the 
disease, but one of his precious store 
of antihistamines seemed to give a 
little relief. It was temporary, of

course, and lie ardently hoped it 
was doing no permanent damage 
. . . but it did shrink the inflamed 
watery bladder that her throat lining -had become under the action of 
killer-enzymes. She would be able 
to breathe more easily now, and to 
sleep. It might last as long as 
twenty-four hours. 

One more day, and by that time 
Hank would be back with a little of 
the latest Earth- developed hormone 
fraction. 

Tony had heard that Benoway, 
over at Mars Machine Tool, was 
using it with startUngly good results 
for serious burns and infections. It 
just .might turn the trick; there was 
no way 'to know till they tried. 

Joan's eyes closed and the doctor 
sat there staring at the parchmentlike lids, her chapped and wrinkled 
lips. Tony grimaced; she was obviously being a fool. 

He rose noiselessly and crossed 
the room to the water jug. When he 
came back he spoke her name softly: "Joan?" 

Her eyes opened and he held out 
the glass. 

"Here's some water." 

"Oh, thank you!" She sighed 
dreamily, reaching out — but she 
snatched her hand back. "No, I 
don't need any." She was wide 
awake now and she looked frightened. "I don't really want it," she 
pleaded, but her eyes never left the 
glass. 

"Take it, drink it and don't be 
silly!" he snapped at her. Then, 



gently, he propped up her shoulders with his arm and held the glass 
to her lips. She sipped hesitantly at 
first, then drank with noisy gulps. 

"What are you trying to do to 
yourself? Didn't I order extra water 
rations for you?" 

She nodded, shamefaced. 

"I'm going to have some words 
with Hank when he comes back, to 
make sure you drink enough." 

"It's not his fault," she said 
quickly. "I didn't tell him. Water's 
so precious and the rest of you are 
working and I'm just lying here. I 
don't deserve any extra water." 

He handed her the glass, refilled, 
and propped her up again. 

"Shut up and drink this." 

She did, with a combination of 
guilt and delight plain on her face. 

"That's better. Hank ought to be 
back tomorrow with the medication 
from Mars Machine Tool. I'll tell 
him about the water myself this 
time, and I don't want any nonsense 
from you about not drinking it. 
You're a lot more valuable to the 
Colony than a few quarts of water." 

" A IX right, Doctor." Her voice 
.Ajl was very small. "Do you 
really think he'll be back tomorrow?" 

Tony shrugged with calculated 
indecision. Mars Machine Tool was 
almost a thousand miles away, and 
allowing time for food and rest, 
Radcliff should be back before midday tomorrow. But Joan's question 
was so pathetically eager, he didn't

dare sound too sure. It was even 
harder when she opened her eyes 
again, while he was closing his bag, 
to ask: "Doctor, will it do any 
good, do you think? You never told 
me the name of it." 

"Oh," he answered vaguely, "it's 
just something new." Just as he 
knew about Hank, he knew perfectly well the sixteen -syllable name 
of the hormone fraction. But he was 
afraid that Joan would know it, too, 
from sensational press stories, and 
that she would expect a miracle. 
The doctor was expecting only 
another disappointment, another 
possibility ruled out, another step 
toward the day when he'd have to 
break the girl's heart by ordering 
her back to Earth. 

"I won't be able to leave anyone 
with you for a while," he told her 
as he left. "I need Gladys to stay 
with Polly Kandro. But remember, 
if you need anything, or want anything, use the intercom. Call somebody to do k for you. Your heart 
isn't in any shape for exercise." 

■ She nodded without lifting her 
head from the pillow, and smiled 
gratefully. Things would he better, 
Tony thought, when Hank was 
back. 

The sun was beating down more 
strongly when he stepped outside. It 
was past mid-morning already, and 
he had to get over to Nick Cantrella's: give him official clearance 
on the burned arm, and talk to 
him "about Bell's threat. But there 
were other patients, and they 



needed treatment more urgently 
than Nick. Better to get through 
with them first. Then when he got 
to Cantrella, they'd be able to 
buckle down to the truarantine 
problem.
CHAPTER FIVE 

A YOUNG, girl's head was splitting with the agony of her infected supraorbital sinus, but she 
was no whiner and even managed 
a smile. 

"I've got a present for you, Dorothy," he said. "It's from a girl who 
was your age a couple of centuries 
ago. Her name was Tracy. I don't 
know whether it was her last or first 
name, but she gave it to this stuff." 
He held up a hypo filled with 
golden fluid. "It's called bacitracin. 
They found out that this Tracy's 
body fought off some infections, so 
they discovered how it did the trick 
and wrapped it up in this stuff — a 
good, effective antibiotic." 

She hardly noticed the needle. 
Misdirection is as useful to a doctor 
as it is to a stage magician, he 
thought wryly. 

A middle-aged man who should 
have known better was recovering 
nicely from his hernia operation. 

"I still say, Oscar, that you 
shouldn't have let me fix it up. 
You would have been a medical 
marvel — The Man Who Got Ruptured on Mars. I could have had

Poker-faced, the doctor told her: 
"Mrs. Beyles, you're the most 
difficult medical problem — a maladjusted person. I wouldn't be that direct if we were on Earth, but this 
is Sun Lake. We can't have you

"Ail right, Doc f " grinned Oscar, 
red-faced. "You made your point.

Was he right? he wondered. He 




 



knew the woman, would never believe him and would hate him forever, but it was another kind of 
surgery that had to be done — fortunately, not often. The woman 
would either change her attitude, 
thereby losing her ills and becoming the asset to the Colony that her 
strapping frame and muscles should 
make her, or out she would go. It 
was brutal, it was profit-and-loss, 
it was utterly necessary. 

AND so to Nick Cantrella at last, 
thank Heaven. Heaven had 
often been thanked in the colony 
for Nick's arrival. He was the born 
leader, the inspired and unorthodox 
electronics man who hadn't garnered the sheaf of degrees needed 
for a halfway decent job on an 
Earth cluttered with bargain counter 

Ph.D.s. 

In the Colony he had signed up 
as a maintenance and setup man, 
but spent so much of his time troubleshooting that he was finally relieved of the routine part of his 
work. Just recently he had been 
promoted to chief of maintenance, 
purchasing and repairs of all Lab 
equipment. His new dignity hadn't 
kept him out of trouble. He was 
home with a nasty chemical burn in 
his arm acquired far outside the 
line of duty. 

Tony didn't know whether he 
was glad or sorry Nick had missed 
the session with Bell and Brenner. 
Nick could think on his fect, but it 
was an even chance that Brenner's 



oily sympathy and Bell's open contempt of the Colony would have 
goaded him into thinking with his 
iists. 

"Tony!" Nick yelled as he came 
in the door. "Gracey was here with 
the news. It's the biggest thing that 
ever hit Sun Lake! It'll be the making of us!" 

"Let's see the arm, Combustible," 
said Tony dryly. "Medicine first, 
politics later." 

Nick fumed as the doctor removed the dressing and examined 
the site of the burn — now just a 
good scar, painless, non-disabling 
and uncomplicated, due to quick 
poulticing and a, heavy coat of 
eschar. 

Tony slapped Nick on the back. 
"Okay, Fearless," he said. "You can 
go back to work. Inhale chlorine. 
Drop pigs of osmium on your toes. 
Sit on a cratefui of radiophosphorus 
and get a battful of geigers. Stir 
nitric acid with your forefinger. 
There's lots of things you haven't 
tried yet; maybe you'll like them — 
who knows?" 

"So it splashed," Nick grinned, 
flexing his arm. "Damn good 
thing I wasn't there this morning. I 
would' ve thrown those bums out. 
Do you realize that this is the biggest break we've ever had? Why, 
man, we should have been praying 
for something just like this to happen. We never would have cut the 
Earth tie on our own and given up 
luxuries like Earths ide medicine. 
I'm glad Bell's kicking us into it.

All we have to do is retool for 
OxEn." His face glowed. "What 
a beautiful job that's going to be! 
Those boys in the Lab can do 
anything- — -with my machinery, of 
course,'' he added. 

"You can't do it, Nick." Tony 
shook his head ruefully. "Ask any 
of the biochem boys. I went on the 
guided tour through the Kclsey 
plant in Louisville while I was 
thinking over joining the Colony. 
It left me footsore and. limping 
because that plant is ten stories high 
and covers four city blocks. They 
operate more than 500 stages of 
concentration and refinement to roll 
those little pink pills out of protoculture. And the first couple of 
hundred stages have to be remotecontrol sterile. There isn't as 
much glass on all of Mars as the 
Kelsey people had just in their 
protoculture tanks. It's out, boy. 
Out'' 

"Hell, we'll rig up something. 
With all the crooks on Mars t we 
can make something they want and 
swap it for OxEn across Bell's 
search cordon. Don't worry about 
it, Tony. This should have happened a long time ago. On our 
own !" 

"You're missing something. 
What if we do catch a marcaine 
thief and the hoard and turn them 
over to Bell ?" 

NICK was thunderstruck. "You 
mean you think it wasn't a 
frameup? One of our guys?" 



"We can't rule it out until we've' 
looked." 

"Yeah, it could happen. Well, if 
you'll kindly write out my medical 
discharge, I'll get a majority together and put -it in the form of a 
motion that we hold a shakedown 
inspection of the Colony." 

"There's an easier way, maybe," 
Tony said. "Anybody who toted that 
much marcaine got gowed up on 
the stuff, whether he knows it or 
not. It's micron dust — fused ampoules are about the only thing 
that hold it without leakage, and 
this was in bulk. Also, the thief 
might be a regular marcaine addict 
as well as wanting the stuff to sell." 

"So," Nkk grinned, "we line 
everybody up and just see which 
one docs this." He went into a 
comedy routine of tics and twitches 
and strange yapping noises. "You 
know that won't work," he wound 
up soberly. "There isn't any way to 
smell out a markie." 

"Practically no way," Tony corrected him. "That's why Brenner's 
a trillionaire and that's why anarcaine gives stiff competition to 
Earthside narcotics in spite of the 
extra cost. The damned stuff doesn't 
affect you so people notice. You become an addict, you take your belt 
as often as you please, and you can 
live in your own private sweetdream world without anybody the 
wiser until— blooie! — you drop 
dead from failure of the cardiac 
node to keep your heart pumping." 

"You said practically no way," 



44 




 



Nick reminded him. "What's the 
catch? Have you got an angle?" 

"I get my electroencephalograph 
out and read up on the characteristic 
brainwave patterns of marcaine 
users. Then I run the e. e. g. over 
everybody who could possibly have 
carried the stuff from Brenner to 
here. You want to line that up for 
me?" 

Nick nodded glumly. "Sure," he 
said, "but you won't find any 
markies here. It's a frameup, I tell 
you . . . Hello, honey! What are 
you doing home at this hour of the 
day? What's all that junk for?" 

TONY turned tosee'Marian Cantrella, -Nick's blonde and beautiful wife, pushing her way through 
the door, her arms full of soft 
white cloth, scissors, heat-sealer, 
and paper patterns. 

"You'll be witness, won't you, 
Tony, when I testify that I only 
left home because he didn't want 
me here ?" Marian turned large 
violet eyes from the doctor to her 
husband and back again. "On second thought," she concluded, 
"you're no better than he is. Could 
cither one of you big, strong men 
stop gaping and give me a hand 
with this stuff?" 

Nick jumped up and relieved her 
of some of her bundles. "What's it 
all about?" He fingered the fine 
cloth curiously. 

"Baby shirts, nightgowns, and 
diapers," Marian said composedly. 
"Are you all through pawing it?" 



"Oh, for the Kandro kid.'" But 
he didn't relinquish the material. 
"Where'd the cloth come from?" 

"I think they just ran it off." 
Marian took the heat-sealer from 
him and plugged it in to the house 
battery to warm up. She cleared a 
space on the table and laid out the 
patterns to study. "What's the matter?" she asked. "Something wrong 
with it?" 

"No, it's a nice job."" He 
brought the bolt of cloth over 'to 
the table and spread it out, then 
carefully pulled a thread loose. "But 
they should have replaced the extrusion nozzle. See that line there 
— there on the side — where it looks 
irregular?" 

Tony went over to look at the 
thread Nick was holding up to the 
light. He couldn't see anything 
wrong with it, and Marian, confessed she couldn't, either. 

"It's there," Nick told them. "U 
means a worn nozzle. But It's not a 
bad job. Who did the setup?" 

"For heaven's sake!" Marian exploded. "/ don't know who did it! 
They handed it to me and said go 
home and make tiny garments, so I 
went !" 

"Okay, baby," Nick soothed her. 
"I just thought you might know." 
He turned to Tony as Marian began cutting off squares from the 
bolt for diapers. "I don't see how 
they had a machine free for it," he 
fretted. "Every piece of equipment 
in the shop was scheduled for full 
time until Shipment— Well," he

stopped hiimself, "I guess it doesn't 
matter anyhow. From here on out 
we can pretty much stop worrying 
every time we need .to use a piece 
of the Lab for Colony goods. The 
days of plenty have arrived — extra 
underwear and new dinner plates 
all around." 

"Sure," the doctor agreed sourly. 
''All the pajamas you want — and 
no OxEn. Tell me, Marian, what 
are the women saying about this 
marcaine business?" 

"Same as the men, I guess." She 
tested the heat-sealer on a corner of 
the first diaper, and turned the dial 
for more heat. "It'll blow over. 
Even if this shipment does get 
held up, it'll straighten out. Kind of 
a shame if we're cordoned while the 
rocket's in, though." 

SHE tried the sealer again, gave 
a small satisfied grunt, then 
began running it deftly along the 
cut edges, leaving a smooth perfect selvedge behind. 

"I was hoping we'd get a look 
at Douglas Graham,'* she added. 
"I think he's ivonderfulV 

"Hah?" demanded Nick, starting. "Oh, the This Is man. My. rival. 
He should be honored to be my 
lival." 

"What's going on?" asked Tony. 
"Is dt a family joke?" 

"Douglas Graham's a national 
joke," said Nick. "Now that he's 
going to gunth Mars, that makes 
him an interplanetary joke." 

"Oh, the writer," Tony remem

bered. The rocket doctor had told' 
him last trip that Graham would 
be aboard the next. 

"He's wonderful," said Marian. 
"I just loved This Is Eurasia. All 
those dictators, and the Cham of 
Tartary and the history, he made it 
sound so exciting — just like a 
story." 

"This Is Mars," said Nick sonorously. "Chapter One, Page One, 
The Story of the Sun Lake Colony, 
or, A Milestone in the History of 
Mankind." 

"Do you think he really will write 
us up?" asked Marian. "I mean if 
that silly marcaine business doesn't 
keep him away?" 

"No, pet. We'll be ignored or 
maybe he'll take a few digs at us. 
His books run first as serials in 
World Welfare, and World Welfare isn't interested in co-op colonists. It is interested in Pittco #3 
over the hill, I'll bet you, by the 
way Pittco advertises. He'll probably play up all the industrial 
colonies as big smash-hits for free 
enterprises and not mention things 
like the Pittco red-light house." 

MARIAN'S lips tightened. "I 
don't think it's decent" she 

said. 

"Right," agreed Nick soberly. 
"I'll tell Madame Rose tonight. 
Haven't been over for days. I'll tell 
her my wife doesn't understand me 
and doesn't think her girls are decent. Want to come along and make 
a night of it, Tony?" 


 



"Ump," said Tony. If he was 
any judge, Marian's sense of humor 
didn't go that far. 

"That's not whit I meant!" she 
tried indignantly. "I meant it wasn't 
decent for him to hide things like 
that and — oh, you're joking ! Well, 
I don't believe he would do it! I've 
read his books and they're good." 

"Have you got any of Graham's 
stuff around?" Tony asked hastily. 
"I don't think I ever read any." 

"I shouldn't take time out," said 
Marian, a little sulkily, "but — ■" 

SHE put down the scaler and 
shooed Tony off the trunk he'd 
been sitting on. A considerable 
quantity of wool socks and underwear turned up before she hit the 
right level. She handed over a conventional onionskin export edition. 
Tony read at random: 

The Cham's black eyes met 
mine with a gaze hypnotic in 
its intensity. The corners of his 
mouth drew up in a smile. The 
Cham spoke, and the front of 
his plum-colored silk robe embroidered with three-toed dragons in gold and silver thread 
rose and fell as he gestured 
for emphasis. 

These arc the words of the 
man who rules over the twentyfive million souls that hold the 
lifeline between America's 
frontier on the Yang-Tse Kian 
River and her allies in the 
Middle East: "Please convey 



to the people of your country 
my highest esteem and warmest assurances that the long 
peace between our nations shall 
never be broken without cause 
by me." 

The significance of this — 

Tony handed the book back. "I 
don't think I've been missing 
much," he said. 

"When you've read one, you've 
■read 'cm all," Nick agreed. "All 
those gunthers are the same." 

Marian was still digging through 
the trunk, fascinated at the forgotten things she was turning up. It 
was surprising how little used were 
most of the items they had found 
essential to include in their limited 
ua Rg a £ e when they left Earth. 

"Here's something," she laughed. 
"I used to read it back on Earth, 
and I thought it would be so useful 
here . . ." 

She held out an onion sk i n 
pamphlet titled in red: The Wonders of Mars, by Red Sand Jim 
Granata, Interplanetary Pioneer. 

"I remember standing for the 
longest time with an extra lipstick 
in one hand and this in the other, 
and they both weighed exactly the 
same, and I decided . . ." She 
broke out in another peal of laughter. "I decided to be practical ami 
take this. What I wouldn't give 
for that lipstick now!" 

Nick took the book from her and 
riffled through the pages with a 
reminiscent smile. "It's terrible.

Tony," he said. "Get these chapter 
headings: 'Mining for Emeralds,* 
"Trapped in a Sandstorm' — Red 
Sand Jim should wish the air on 
Earth was as clear as the heart of a 
Martian sandstorm — 'Besieged by 
Brownies tin the Rimrock Hills.' " 

r What?" demanded the doctor, 
incredulously. 

" 'Besieged by Brownies in the 
Rimrock Hills.' If you don't believe me, look. The Brownies, it 
says here, were a constant menace to 
intrepid interplanetary pioneers like 
Red Sand Jim because they killed 
people and stole their babies and 
things like that. They didn't often 
see one — " 

"Naturally." 

"XTATURALLY, Doctor, natuX\ rally. But 'they were littlepeople who didn't wear shoes or 
clothes, it says here — which reminds 
me." He closed the book. "I was 
out at the caves yesterday — took a 
ride with one of the prospectors. 
We've Sever really looked into the 
caves, and I had nothing better to 
do while you were teaching me 
safety precautions, so I wandered 
around some, and found kids' footprints dn the entrance to one of 
them." 

"They take the goats out there to 
graze sometimes," Tony said. 

"That's not it. Looks like they've 
been going barefoot, and I don't 
think they ought to be allowed — " 

"They certainly shouldn't!" Matian was indignant. "Why, they 



could hurt themselves. And they 
shouldn't be allowed in those caves 
either." 

"They're not," Tony said grimly. 
1 'They have strict orders to stay 
away from the caves. But I never 
thought they'd be screwy enough to 
try going barefoot. I'll have to tell 
them about it." 

"Tell them good," Nick urged 
him. "There's a lot of rock out 
there, and a lot of dangerous surface salts." 

"I wish I knew some way to 
make it stick," the doctor said, worriedly. "Once those kids get a notion in their heads — if they still 
hang around the caves after listening to old man Lcaroyd's horror 
stories — I don't know." 

"Don't take it so hard." Nick 
couldn't stay serious long. "Maybe 
it wasn't the kids. Could -be it's 
Brownies." 

"Ve-ry funny. Til pass the word 
to the mothers that there shouldn't 
be any barefoot boy stuff on Mars. 
I've got enough trouble without 
frostbitten toes, lacerations andinineral poisoning." 

"You better hope they're Brownieprints, Tony. That'd be easier to 
handle than teaching our pack of 
kids." 

"Look who's talking! I'll thank 
you to line up that vote on an 
e.e.g. test for marcaine now while 
I dig up my medkftl reference. 
Also — " he got up briskly — "if 
there's more 'trouble coming, I better take care of myself while I can.

Lunch' 11 be all gone if I don't get 
there soon." 

Tony had small zest for the communal meals shared by most of the 
unmarried members of the settlement. Pooling rations and taking 
turns at the work did make it easier 
to get decent meals; but the atmosphere was, inevitably, one of noisy 
good-fellowship. The doctor would 
have preferred a quieter and more 
restful arrangement. He thought 
wistfully for a moment of the comradeship that existed between Nick 
and his wife. On second thought, 
it would hardly be worth it, having 
to get married in order to have his 
meals at home. 

CHAPTER SIX 

FORTY years in the life of a 
planet is nothing at all, especially when the planet is ancient 
Mars. It had been that long since 
the first Earth rocket had crashed 
at the southern apex of Syrtis Major 
— and remained there, a shining, 
rustless memorial with only the 
broad fractures in its fuel tanks to 
tell its story to those who came 
after. 

Forty years, almost, since the first 
too-hopeful colonists followed, 
three thousand doomed souls. Their 
Earth-bred bodies, less durable than 
the flimsiest of their constructions, 
were already rotted to the skeletons 
when a belated relief ship came 
with the supplies without which 
they had starved to deaith. 



Forty years, now, of slow growth 
but rapid change, during which a 
barren world had played host to, 
successively, a handful of explorers; 
a few score prospectors and wanderers-at-Iarge; a thousand or so 
latter-day homesteaders, with 'their 
lean, silent women; and finally — 
after OxEn — the new industrial colonies, none of them more than five 
years old. 

The explorers had disappeared: 
gone back to Earth to lecture and 
write, or blended completely into 
the Martian scene; the prospectors 
and frontiersmen, most of them, 
had died; but the colonists, determined to stay on, drew fresh blood 
continually from the lifeline at 
Marsport — the quarterly rockets 
from Earth. 

Sun Lake City Colony, alone 
among those who had come to 
Mars, wanted nothing more than to 
cut, once and for ever, that vital tie 
with Earth. But it was too soon, still 
too soon; the Colony was not yet 
strong enough to live, if the umbilical cord were severed. 

And the colonists knew it. After 
lunch they gathered in the Lab, 
every last man, woman, and child. 
Tony rose from the black box of the 
electroencephalograph to count 
heads. 

"We're one over," he told Nick. 
"Polly's in the hospital, Joan's 
home, Hank's at Mars Machine 
Tool or on his way back. Tad's on 
radio shack. Who's the spare?" 

"Learoyd," said Nick. "And I've 



MARS CHILD 



49 



got Tad messaging Machine Tool to 
confirm Hank's whereabouts for the 
last four days." 

"Okay. I'll get Tad later." 

A whiskery man who looked as 
though he was pushing 90 stormed 
up to the doctor. 

"It ain't your business whether I 
take a sniff of marcaine now and 
again and it ain't for you to say I 
stole any hundred kilos if you do 
find I use it once in a way. Bunch 
of greeners !" 

"Calm down, Lcaroyd," sighed 
the doctor. 

"Greener!" taunted theold-timer. 
"Call yourself Marsmen!" 

"You can call us anything you 
want, Learoyd," said the doctor. 
"Only we've got to straighten this 
tiling out. When did you last take 
marcaine? It won't — " 

"You don't even know where 
you are!" quavered the old man. 
"Lake-us Sole-us, my eye ! You're 
right on the edge of Ryan's, Plain 
and you don't even know it. He 
was here first and he had a right to 
name it! Old Jim Ryan . . ." 

PATIENTLY Tony tried to explain; "Brenner says somebody 
Stole the hundred kilos of marcaine 
two days ago. It could have been 
any of us. You were around, so 
we've got to be able to tell Commissioner Bell — " 

"Another greener — a politician 
greener. The Law on Mars !'* Learoyd" s voice was heavily satirical. 
"When there was twenty, thirty of 



us, we didn't need no law; we 
didn't go around thieving ! We got 
here ahead of you all, you and the 
farmers, too. What for did you 
have to come crowding in?" 

"When did you take that last belt 
of marcaine?" 

The old pork-and-beaner sighed 
brokenly. "It was more'n two years 
ago. I ain't got money for marcaine. 
I ain't a panhandler and I do a 
good job hauling for you, don't I?" 

"Sure, Learoyd." 

"Then why do you have to come 
bothering me? We was here first! 
He collapsed into the chair by the 
black box, grieving for the past of 
the Led planet, before this damn 
OxEn, when Marsworthy lungs 
were a man's passport to adventure 
where no man had ever been before, where a mountain range was 
your mountain 'range and nobody 
else's, where Jim Ryan died in the 
middle of great, flat, spreading 
Ryan's Plain, starved to death out 
there when his halftrack brokedown. 

Lcaroyd chuckled, not feeling the 
electrodes they were putting to his 
head. He'd got off a good one — 
five years on Mars and these ten 
greeners landed. They wanted to be 
heroes, the little greeners, but he 
told them. He sure told them. 

"Call yourselves Marsmen? In 
six months half of you'll be dead. 
And the other half'll wish they 
was." 

Jim Granata was in that bunch — 
a sly one, pumping him, making 



50 




 



notes, making sketches, but he 
wasn't a Marsman. He went back to 
Earth and made him a pot full of 
money with books and — what did 
they call it? — Granata's Combined 
Interplanetary Shows. Little Jim, he 
called himself Red Sand Jim Granata, but he was never a Marsman. 

The Marsmen came first. Sam 
Welch surveyed Royal Range, the 
Palisades. Amhy McCoy — he got 
killed by eating Mars plants; they 
found him with his food run out, 
curled up with the agony of poisoning. A thousand dollars a day they 
got then, when a thousand dollars 
was a thousand. 

It was in "07 he told off those 
greeners twenty-eight years ago. 
Only One rocket every couple years 
then, and sometimes they didn't get 
through. Jim Granata, he never set 
foot on Mars after '18 with his 
money and all; he wasn't a Marsman. They were here first. Nobody 
could take that away from them. 

Sam Welch, Amby McCoy, Jim 
Ryan. Why not die too? Learoyd 
wondered bitterly. A thousand dollars a day they paid him when a 
thousand dollars was a thousand, 
and look at him now. Where had 
it gone? Why was he living by 
hauling dirt for the greeners when 
h<_- had been here first? His Up 
trembled and he wiped his mouth. 

SOMEBODY was shaking his 
shoulder and saying: "That's 
all, Learoyd. You're In the clear. 
Nothing to worry about." 



The old man slouched through 
the crowd and out of the Lab, shaking his head and muttering what 
sounded like curses. 

Tony hadn't been very far from 
hoping that Learoyd would turn out 
to be the thief. The law would have 
to go easy on him and it would 
clean up the Colony's problem. 

Colonist after colonist seated 
himself in the chair and cleared 
himself by revealing marcaine-ncgative brainwaves to the e.e.g. Tony 
didn't dare to think of what it 
meant. The last of them, the boy 
from the radio shack, was relieved 
to take his turn. 

"That's the lot," Tony reported 
to Nick when young Tad, too, was 
cleared by the machine, and had 
gone back to his job. 

Cantrella refused to share the 
doctor's gloom. "It's just what we 
needed," he insisted, smacking his 
fist into his palm. "Face it, man. 
There isn't any marcaine thief. Bell 
thinks he can run us off Mars by 
cutting off our import-export. Let 
them cut us off! We'll barter for 
OxEn. We'll damn well do without 
the Earthside enzymes and immunizers. We'll get tough with Mars, 
lick it on its own ground! We'll 
have to eventually; why not right 
now?" 

"I don't know, Nick. I think 
you're going too fast," Tony demurred. "Look at old Learoydhe's us, only a little worse." 

"The pork-and-beaners imported 
their food, clothes, fuel, and look 



MARS CHILD 



51 



at them !" Nick insisted. "They 
failed. They didn't strike roots. 
They didn't adapt!" 

"I don't know, Nick," the doctor 
repeated unhappily. "I've got to go 
see Polly and the baby now." 

ii 

TONY lugged the e.e.g. back to 
■his hospital-shack and found 
Anna holding the hand of a white, 
trembling, terrified Polly. Polly's 
other arm was around the baby, 
clutching the red-faced little thing 
as if it <were on the edge of a 
precipice. 

Without a word he took the 
child, snapped on his stethoscope 
and sounded its heart, which was 
normal. In spite of the red-faced 
creature's squirming, the minute 
oxygen mask was in place. 

Baffled, he replaced the baby and 
demanded of the women: "What's 
wrong ?" 

"I have to work," said Anna abruptly. She patted Polly's hand and 
slipped out. 

"I saw something," Polly whispered. Her eyes were crazy. 

Tony sat on the side of the bed 
and picked up the hand Anna had 
been holding. It was cold. 

"What did you see, Polly?" he 
asked kindly. "Spots on the baby? 
A rash?" 

She disengaged her hand and 
and pointed at the window in line 
with the bed and two meters from 
its foot. 



"I saw a brownie. It wanted to 
steal my baby." She clutched the 
child again, not taking her eyes off 
the window. 

Normally Tony would have been 
amused and not shown it. Under 
the strain of the day, he fought 
down a violent anger. The little 
idiot! At a time when the whole 
Colony was in real and deadly peril, 
she was making no effort to distinguish between a dream and reality. 

"You must have drowsed off," he 
said, not as harshly as he felt. "It 
was just a nightmare. With your 
history, of course you're afraid that 
somehow you'll lose this baby too. 
You've heard all this pork-andbeaner and homesteader nonsense 
about brownies, so in your dream 
your fear took that form. That's all 
there is to it." 

Polly shook her head. "Gladys 
was staying with me," she recited 
monotonously, "and she had to go 
to that test in the Lab and she said 
she'd send somebody who'd been 
tested as soon as she got there. Just 
when I heard the door close, this 
face came up outside the window. 
It was a brownie face. It had big 
thin cars and big eyes, with thin 
eyebrows, and it was bald and 
leathery. 

"It looked at me and then it 
looked at my baby. I screamed and 
screamed but it just looked at my 
baby. It wanted to steal my baby. 
And then it got down below the 
window sill just before Anna came 



52 




 



in. Even after she put my baby 
here with me, I couldn't stop shaking." 

Anger was getting the better of 
him. "Do you realize that your story 
is perfectly ridiculous if you insist 
on claiming it really happened, but 
perfectly logical if you admit it was 
.1 dream?" 

SHE began to cry and hug the 
baby. "I saw it! I saw it! I'm 
afraid. 1 " 

Tony relaxed ; tears were the best 
medicine for her tension. To help 
them along, he rose and got her a 
sedative and a glass of water. 

"Take this," he said, putting the 
capsule to her mouth. 

"I don't want to go to sleep!" 
she sniffled. But she swallowed it 
and in a minute or two felt under 
her pillow for a handkerchief. 

When she had wiped her eyes 
and blown her nose, the doctor said 
qu ietly : "I can prove it was a 
dream. The brownies are just the 
kind of rhing the pork-and-beaners 
and the homesteaders would invent 
to scare themselves with. And the 
myth got exploited in the Sunday 
supplements and on TV, of course. 
But there can't be any brownies because there isn't any animal life on 
Mars. 

"We've been exploring this 
planet up, down and sideways for 
40 years now. We found a weed 
you can make dope out of; we 
found you can make liquor- out of 
Mars plants; we found a lot of ores 



and minerals. But not one trace of 
animal life. Think of it, Polly — 40 
years and nobody has found any 
animal life on Mars." 

She reasoned, a little fuzzy with 
the sedative: "Maybe brownies 
could stay out of people's way. If 
they're smart they could.!* 

"That's right. But what did the 
brownies evolve from in that case? 
You know that if you have a higher 
form of 11 f e, it evol v ed from a 
lower f orm. Where are all the 
lower forms of life that evolved 
into brownies? There aren't any. 
Not so much as one puny little 
amoeba. So if there's no place the 
brownies could have come from, 
there arc no brownies." 

Her face relaxed a little, and 
Tony talked on doggedly. "You got 
a bad scare and no mistake. But you 
scared yourself, like the homesteaders that started this nonsense." A 
sudden notion struck him. He put 
it in the urgent file, and went on. 
"You were afraid your bad luck 
would catch up with you and take 
your baby away. This is Mars, so 
you symbolized it as a brownie. The 
vividness doesn't mean anything — 
you probably saw a scacy picture in 
the papers of a baby-stealing Martian brownie and stored it in your 
memory, and out it popped at the 
ri^ht time." 

Polly cracked a sleepy smile and 
said, "I'm sorry," and dosed her 
eyes. 

She'U be all right, thought Tony, 
and it's a good thing H turned up to 



MARS CHILD 



53 



remind me of the homesteaders — 
Thaler? Toller? 

Whoever they were, the old couple on the wretched "farm"' to the 
South. Toller, that was. right. He 
hadn't seen them for a year, but he 
was going to see them today. 

Anna was in the other, residential, half of the shack. "I think I 
talked her out of it," he said. 
"You'll stay here?" 

"Yes. Where are you off for?" 
He was lugging the c.e.g. out again. 

"That old couple, the Tollers. I 
wouldn't put the marcaine theft past 
them and they're dose enough to 
our general area. Before the last 
dozen Sun Lakers arrived, I had 
enough time on my hands to run 
out and see how they were coming 
along. If I just tell them it's time 
for another checkup, I'm pretty sure 
I can persuade them to give me a 
brainwave reading. That may break 
the case." 

He strapped the black box lo his 
bicycle and set off. 

iii 

THE Tollers were a different type 
from old Learoyd, and driven 
to Mars by a different urge. Learoyd 
had fancied himself an explorer and. 
adventurer who would make a sudden strike and, after a suitably romantic life of adventure, retire to 

his wealth. 

The T oilers laid the longer, 
slower -maturing plans of peasants: 
In two years, when I have saved up 



seven schilling three groschen, I 
will buy Bauer's ball calf, which 
will service the coirs of the village; 
Fritz by then will be big enough to 
take care of the work. Zimmerman, 
the drunkard, will go into debt to 
me for service of his cows and 
pledge his south strip, so Fritz need 

not marry his Eva. Schumacher* s 
G ret el hits a. harelip but I here's no 
escaping it — his -west pasture adjoins mine . . , 

It hadn't worked out for the 
Tollers — the steady, upward trend 
of land values, the slow improvement of the soil, .the dozen sons and 
daughters to work it, the growing 
village, town, city — 

All that happened was they had 
scratched out a living, had one son 
and gone a little dotty from hardship, Both had Marsworthy lungs. 
If she had not,' Mrs. Toller would, 
like hundreds of Other wives, have 
lived as matter-of-factly in an oxygen mask as her many-times-rcmoved great-grandmother had lived 
in a sunbonnet. 

The husband, by now, was stoneblind. Data from him and hundreds 
of others had helped lo work out 
the protective shots against ultraviolet damage to the eyes, a tiny 
piece in die mosaic of re-search that 
had made real colonization at all 
possible. 

Still, Tony dreaded visiting them. 
He didn't see their mangy goat, last 
of a herd, that had been browsing 
wircgrass on his last trip. They 
must have slaughtered it to aug

Theron," she told her husband. 
"These are our letters to htm," she 
said, producing three spacemailers 
from her bodice. 

Tony started to protest, thought 
.better of it, and glanced at them. 
All three were identical. 

Our Dear Son, 

How are you getting 
along? We are all well and

Your Loving Parents 

ON THE other side, the envelope 
side of spacemail blanks, Tony 
saw canceled fifty-dollar stamps and 
the address to "Theron Pogue Toller, Junior, R. F. D. Six, Texarkana, 
Texas, U. S. A., Earth." The return 
address was: "Mr. and Mrs. T. P. 
Toller, c/o Sun Lake City Colony, 
Mars." Stamped heavily on each 
was a large, red notice: "DIRECTORY SEARCHED, ADDRESSEE 
UNKNOWN, RETURNED TO 
SENDER." 

The old man croaked, "Did. the 
boy 'Write?" 

"I've come to give you a physical 



checkup," said Tony loudly, oppressed by the squalid walls and the 
senile dementia they housed. 

"Isn't that nice of Doctor Tony, 
Theron?" asked Mrs. Toller, tucking the letters back into her dress. 
But the old man had fallen asleep 
again. 

Tony clipped the electrodes on 
and j oggled Toll e r a wak c for a 
reading. Marcaine-negabive. 

"We came in such a beautiful 
rocket ship," rambled Mrs, Toller 
as he put the e.e.g. on her. "It was 
quite an adventure, wasn't it, Theron? We were so young, only 23 
and 24, and we sold our place in 
Missouri. It was such a lovely rocket 
we came in, a little one, not like the 
ones today, but this was before 
Mars got built up. We had quite a 
fright when one of the steering jets 
went bad while Mars was ahead, 
just like a big moon, and the poor 
crewmen had to go outside in their 
suits. It -was quite an adventure, 
wasn't it, Theron? 

*T often wonder, Doctor Tony, 
whether Junior has ever been back 
to the old place an Missouri. We 
had him our first year here, you 
know; he's 19- He wanted to see 
the Earth, didn't he, Theron? So 
when he was 17 we went all the 
way to Marsport to see him off. It 
was quite an adventure, wasn't it, 
Theron? And he sent us his address 
right away — " 

Marcaine-negative brainwave. 

He was too sickened to stay, and 
the btrdlike chatter of Mrs. Toller 



5* 




 



never stopped as lie said good-by 
and wheeled off to Sun Lake. 

Their horrible deterioration during the past year to senility in Hie 
mid-forties answered Nick Cantrclla's plan to establish the colony 
immediately as self-sustaining. 

It simply couldn't be done. It was 
bad enough now — the damn dull, 
monotonous, primitive, regulated 
existence of the colony. How long 
was it now since he'd eaten an egg? 
How Jong since he'd drunk a cup 
of coffee, real coffee, with cream 
and sugar ? How long since he had 
worn underclothes or had a real 
bath ? How long since he'd had a 
highball after a good day's work? 
Or smoked his pipe without frantic 
puffing to keep it lit in the thin, 
cold, oxygen-poor air? 

But life on Mars 'Without even 
the minimum of supplies, immunization and adaptation shots was out 
of the question. If they asked his 
medical advice, his answer would 
have to be; 

"If we are forbidden Earth supplies we must go back to Earth." 

fTTONY groped in his pocket for 
-L his pipe, and clenched it between (his teeth. All right then, he 
thought, go back to Earth — go back 
and get yourself a decent cup of 
coffee in the morning. Go back — 

Back to what? To a clinic in an 
industrial town where he could give 
slapdash time-clocked attention to 
the most obvious ills of men, 
women, and children whose fears 



and deprivations began in the womb 
and ended only in the grave? Cure 
a kid's pneumonia, then send him 
back to the draf ty apartment again? 
Fix up an alcoholic factory -worker, 
and return him to the ugliness that 
will put him on dope or in the 
schizo ward next year? No, he'd 
tried the clinics already, and they 
wouldn't do. 

Back to the office, maybe? An 
office like the one he'd had, briefly, 
in the penthouse of a New York 
apartment building. Take your pa 
tients one at a time, give them 
plenty of attention, they're easy to 
cure if you understand them — the 
ulcers and piles and false pregnancies, the thousand -and -one diseases of the body that grew out of 
the prevailing disease of the mind 
— fear. 

Go back? He bit hard on his 
empty pipe. It would be consoling 
to stand again on Earth, and fill his 
pipe and light it, puff clouds of 
smoke— while he waited for the 
crowded, psychotic planet to blow 
itself up and put an end to man 
once and for all. 

CHAPTER SEVEN 

HANK RAEVCLIFF shook 
Tony awake a little before 

dawn. 

"I got the Stuff, Doc," he 
grinned. "Just came in on foot from 
Pittco. The half-track broke down 
twenty miles out of Mars Machine 
on the way back, and I bummed a 



MARS CHILD 



57 



ride on a Pittco plane headed this 
way. The half-track's still at Rolling 
Mills and — " 

The doctor shook his head grog
gily and thought of giving Hank 
hell for the abrupt awakening. But 
it was hard to stay mad at him, and 
Tony would have been roused by 
his alarm clock for the Lab check 
in a quarter-hour anyway. Did the 
Lab check matter? Did the medication for Joan matter ? No. They 
were all heading back for Earth before long. 

"Make mc some coffee," he 
growled. "One minute by the 
clock." 

HE stretched, rolled out, shucked 
his pajama tops and gave 
himself a sponge bath with a cup of 
water that would mean one less cup 
of coffee for him today. Some 
mornings he just couldn't stand the 
feel or stink of methyl alcohol. 

Shivering, he gulped the coffee 
and pulled on pants, parka and 
sand boots. "Let's see the stuff," he 
said. "Did Benoway give you a letter or note for me?" 

"Oh, sure. I almost forgot." 
Hank handed over an ampoule and 
an onionskin. The note from the 
Mars Machine Tool physician said: 

Dear Hcllman: 

Here is the T7-43 Kelsey 
you requested by radio message. Re your note by messenger, sorry to tell you symptoms 
completely unfamiliar to me. 



Sounds like one of the cases 
any company doc would ship 
back to Earth as soon as possible. The T7-43 has worked 
wonders in heat burns hereand have seen no side reactions. Please let me know how 
it comes out. 

In haste, 

A. Benoway, M. D. 

Tony gru n ted an d beckoned 
Hank after him as he picked up his 
physician's bag and went out into 
the bitter morning cold. 

"Did you say you walked from 
Pittco?" he asked Hank, suddenly 
waking up. 

"Sure," said the youngster genially. "It's good exercise. Look, Doc, 
I don't want to get out of line, but 
I couldn't help noticing that you're 
building up kind of a bay window 
yourself. Now it's my experience 
that those things are easier not to 
put on than to take off — " 

"Shh," said Tony as they stopped 
at the RaddirT shack. They slipped 
in and Tony filled a needle with the 
new Kelsey drug. "Stay in the background until I get this over with 
and motion you in, Hank." 
He awakened the girl. 
"Here's the new stuff, Joan," he 
said. "Ready?" 

She smiled weakly and nodded. 
He shot the stuff into her arm and 
said: "Here's your reward for not 
yelling." Hank duly stepped forward, switching on a light in her 
eyes that did Tony's heart good.

BREAKFAST was fried green 
Mars be an s and ' 'coffee* *— 
bearable, perhaps, under idcaj conditions, but completely inedible in 
the gloomy atmosphere around the 
big table this morning. Tony gulped 
down the hot liquid, and determinedly pushed away his beans, ignoring the pointed looks of more 
righteous colonists, who cleaned 
their plates stubbornly under any 
circumstances. 

The Lab radiation checked out 
okay; no trouble there at least this 
morning. After a meticulous cleanup, he visited Nick Cantrella in the 
hole-in-the-wall office at the back of 
the Lab. 

"How's it look, now you've had 
a night's sleep on it?" Nick demanded. "You still want to throw 
in the sponge? Or are you beginning to see that we can lick this 
damn planet if we only try?" 

"I can't see it," Tony admitted. 
Soberly he told the other man about 
his visit to the Tollers. "And look 
at Old Man Learoyd," the doctor 
ad-ded. "He can't be much past 60 
and that's stretching it. I know he 
came here when he was twenty-one; 
at least, that's what he says — so how 
old can he be ? But I gave that man 
a physical checkup a few months 
back, and, Nick, he not only looks 
like an ill-preserved octogenarian, 
but if I didn't know otherwise, I'd 
stake my medical reputation on his 
being close to ninety." 



Nick whistled. "As bad as that?" 

"What do you expect? Chronic 
vitamin deficiencies, mineral deficiencies, not enough water, neverending fatigue from never-ending 
work — you pay high for trying to 
live off the country. More than it's 
worth." 

Half to himself, Nick said: "Six 
months. We lose our commercial 
contacts, we pay forfeits that eat up 
our cash reserve — what if we just 
go to the buyers and tell them what 
happened?" 

Tony started to answer, but Nick 
answered himself: "It won't work. 
They won't dare place another order 
with us because they'd be afraid it'd 
just happen all over again. And we 
haven't got the funds to sweat it out 
until they forget. Tony, -we're 
u • ashed up I" 

"There's still a search." 

"Hell, you know none of our 
people took the stuff." 

"Let's have a council meeting. I 
want a search." 

Nick, Tony, Gracey and Mimi 
Jonathan held one of their irregular 
conclaves in the doctor's hut. Gracey 
was fiercely opposed to a shakedown check of the homes and belongings of the colonists, swearing 
that it was a frameup by Brenner 
and Bell. The other three outvoted 
him, loathing to invade the pitifully 
small area of privacy left to Sun 
Lake people, but n ot d aring to 
leave a possibility uninvestigated. 

"I suppose, ' ' gru n t ed G racey, 
"that when you find there isn't any 



MARS CHILD 



59 



marcaine in our trunks, you'll tear 
the Lab apart looking for it." 

"If we have to, we may," said 
Tony, poker-faced, but sickened at 
the memory of what isolation from 
the life-giving flow of materials 
from Earth had done to the Tollers. 
"I've had some nasty jobs before 
this.'* He thought of how he had 
lanced the swollen ego of Mrs. Bayles, the neurotic, and how she must 
hate him for it — an ugly thought. 

By. mid-morning, Mimi had the 
shakedown under way. Tony settled 
himself in the radio shack, firing 
message after message to Commission headquarters at Marsport, trying to get through to Lt. Ncaley. 
The operator at Pittco who relayed 
from Marsport telefaxed the same 
reply to the first four mesaces: 
"UNAVAILABLE WILL RELAY 
MESSAGE END CORPORAL 
MORRISON COMMISSION MESSAGE CENTER." 

On the fifth try, Nealey still had 
not been reached — bul Bell had. 

This time the reply was: "LIEUTENANT NEALEY UNAVAILABLE MY ORDERS. UNDER NO 
CIRCUM STANCES GR OUND 
TRACING DEVICE M-27 LENT 
FOR PRIVATE USE. REMINDER 
LIMITED MARS MESSAGE FACILITIES TAXED YOUR FRIVOLOUS REQUESTS. REQUIRE 
CEASE IMMEDIATELY END 
HAMILTON BELL, COMMISSIONER P. A. C." 

Gladys Porosky, the operator on 
duty, piped indignantly: "He can't 



do that, can he, Doctor Tony? The 
relay league's a private arrangement 
between the colonies, isn't it?" 

Tony shrugged helplessly, knowing that Gladys was right and that 
Bell's petulant arrogance was a long 
stretch of his administrative powers—but due process was far away 
on Earth, for those who had the 
time and taste for litigation and the 
cash reserves to stick it out. 

Gracey joined him dn the hut 
long enough to say bitterly, "Come 
and see the loot we accumulated." 

Tony went out to stare unhappily 
at the petty contraband turned up 
by the h umi 1 i atari g search : some 
comic books smuggled in from 
Marsport, heaven knew how, by a 
couple of the youngsters; some dirty 
pictures in the trunk of a young, 
unmarried chemist; an unauthorized 
.32 pistol in the mattress of a notably nervous woman colonist; a 
few bottles and boxes of patent 
medicine on which the doctor 
frowned; a minute quantity of real 
Earthside coffee kept to be brewed 
and drunk in selfish solitude. 

By mid-aftcrnoon this much was 
certain — any marcaine hidden in the 
Colony was not in a private home. 

The Lab would have to be 
searched next. 

iii 

IT WAS like going into a new 
world, to escape from the 
doomed, determined optimism of 
the search squad and council mem



 



bers, back to the cheerful radiance 
that inhabited the hospital. Tony 
stood in the doorway, studying the 
family group across the room — 
father and mother thoroughly absorbed in each other and in the tiny 
occupant of . the white-painted 
wicker basket that served as hospital 
bassinet. 

It was still hard to believe the 
delivery had gone so well. Tony 
wondered again, as he had so often 
in the preceding months, what 
could possibly have gone wrong 
with all the previous attempts, before they came to Mars. 

There had been frequent conceptions: six known miscarriages, and 
an unknown number of first-month 
failures. A series of experts back on 
.Earth had searched for the reason, 
and confessed failure. There "was 
nothing wrong "with Polly organically, and microscopic examinations 
failed to show any deficiency in her 
or in Jim. ^Cith that history, Tony 
had been prepared, right up to the 
last minute, for trouble that never 
materialized. It was still hard to believe that their success, his and 
Polly's, could -have been so easily 
achieved. 

"He's awake again !" Polly hadn't 
cjuite made up her mind whether to 
be proud or worried. "He slept for 
a little while after you left," she explained, "but then he started crying 
and woke himself up. You should 
have seen how mad he was — his 
face was so red !" 

"He's tjuiet enough now." Tony 



went over and stared down thoughtfully at the small circle of face, 
half-obscured by the oxygen mask. 
Certainly there was no sign of ill 
health. The baby was a glowing 
pink color, and his still -wrinkled 
limbs were flailing the air with 
astonishing energy. But a newborn 
baby should sleep; this one shouldn't 
be awake so much. 

"It's possible he's hungry," the 
doctor decided. "Hasn't he cried at 
all since he woke up?" 

"Oh, a little, every now and then, 
but if you turn him over, he stops." 

Tony went over and scrubbed his 
hands in the alcohol basin, then 
came back and surveyed the baby 
again. "1 think we'll try a feeding," 
he decided. "I've been waiting for 
him to yell for it, but let's see. Maybe that's what he wants." 

"But — " Jim flushed and stopped. 

HIS wife broke into delighted 
laughter. "He means my 
milk isn't in yet," Polly said to the 
doctor; and then to Jim, "Silly! He 
has to learn liow to nurse first. He 
doesn't need any food yet. And the 
other stuff is there — what do you 
call it?" 

"Colostrum," Tony told her. He 
removed the baby from the crib, 
checked the mask to make sure it 
was firmly in place, then lowered 
the infant to his mother's waiting 
arms. 

"Just be sure," he warned her, 
"that the mask doesn't slip off his 
nose. There's enough area around 



MARS CHILD 



61 



his mouth exposed so he can feed 
and breathe at the same time." 

THE baby nuzzled against iher for 
a. moment, then spluttered furiously, turned a rich crimson and 
spewed back a mouthful of thin 
fluid. Hastily Dr. Tony removed 
the infant, patted and held him 
until 'the choking fit stopped and 
restored him to his basket. 

Polly and Jim were both talking 
at once. 

"Hold on!" said the doctor. "It's 
not the end of the world. Lots of 
babies don't know how to feed 
properly at first. He'll probably 
learn by the time your milk comes. 
Anyhow, he'll learn when he needs 
it. Babies don't stay hungry. It's 
like the oxy mask— he breathes 
through his nose instead of his 
mouth because the air is better. We 
don't have to cover up his mouth 
to make him do it. When he needs 
some food he'll learn what his 
mouth is for — fast." 

"But, Doc, are you sure there's 
nothing wrong with him? Are you 
sure?" 

"Jim, in my business, I'm never 
sure of anything," Tony said mildly. 
"Only I've never yet seen a baby 
that didn't find some way to eat 
when it wanted food. If your pride 
and joy won't take the breast, we'll 
get Anna to whip up some bottles 
for him. It's as simple as that." 

Or not so simple^ — 

George and Harriet Bergen's 
eight-month-old Lorctta, conceived 



on Earth but born at Sun Lake, was 
still feeding from the breast. Loretta would be weaned not to milk 
but to the standard Colony diet plus 
vitamin concentrates when the time 
came. It was what the older children 
ate; they had forgotten what mMk 
■tasted like. 

There were milch-goats, of 
course, and some day there would 
be milk for everybody in the Colony to drink. Buit to make that possible, it was necessary now to allocate all the milk produced by the 
herd to the nourishment of more 
goats, to build up the stock. 

It was hard enough to keep the 
herd growing even wi*h best of 
care. Yaks, at first, had seemed like 
a better bet for acclimatization to 
the Martian atmosphere, but they 
were too big to ship full-grown, and 
so far no young animals had survived the trip. So the Colony had 
brought over three pairs of tough 
kids, and bred them as rapidly as 
possible. Half the newborn kids 
still died, but the surviving half 
needed every bit of milk there was. 
Still, if necessary, a kid would have 
to be sacrificed, and the milk diverted to the baby. 

Tony pulled himself out of the 
useless speculation with a start of 
dismay. There was no sense planning too far ahead now; Bell might 
solve this problem for them, too. 

"Anything else you want to know 
before you go home?" he asked. 
"Have any trouble with the mask?" 

"Anna checked us out on that," 



62 




 



Jim told him. M lt seems to be simple enough." 

"Where is she? In the living 
room ?" Tony started toward the 
door. 

"She went home,'' Polly put in. 
"She said she had a headache, and 
when Jim came in she showed us 
about the mask again, and then 
went , . ." 

"Hi, Tony. Can I see you a minute?"' Marian Cantrella stuck her 
head through the outside door to 
the hospital. Tony turned and went 
out with her. 

"TS SHE ready to go?" Marian 

X wanted to know. 

"Since this morning, really. But 
the damn search — how's their 
place? Did anybody get it back in 
order?" 

"I just came from there," Marian 
nodded. "We've got it all fixed up 
and the new room's all done. The 
wails are still a little damp. Does 
that matter?" 

"It'll dry overnight," Tony reflected. "They can keep the baby in 
the room with them till then . . ." 

"Pol ly must be dying to get 
home," Marian broke in. 

"I guess she is. Okay," he decided, "but it'll have to be right 
away. In another hour, it'll be too 
cold for the baby to go out." 

"Right." She started away, and 
Tony was about to open the door 
when she turned back. "Oh, I almost forgot. Is it all right for Hank 
to take Joan out to watch? I was 



talking to her before, and she felt 
so left out of everything . . ." 

"I guess so." He thought it over 
and added, "Only if she's carried, 
though. Maybe Hank can fix up a 
tote truck from the Lab for her to 
ride on. I don't want ihcr to use up 
what strength she has." 

"I'll fix it," Marian promised. 
"I think it would mean a lot to 
her." Her golden curls shook 
brightly around her head as she 
ran off down the street. 

Tony went back into the hospital. 
"Guess it's time to get you folks 
out of here," he told the Kandros. 
"Place is too cluttered up. I might 
need this spate for someone who's 
s'uk" 

Polly smiled up at him from the 
chair where she had been sitting for 
the last hour. "I don't know what 
I can wear," she worried happily. 
"The things I came in would fall 
right off me, and I can't very well 
go out this way. Jim, you better ..." 

"Jim," Tony interrupted, "You 
better get some sense into that wife 
of yours. You'll go put the way 
you are," he told Polly, "and you'll 
get right into bed when you get 
there, too. You've been up long 
enough for one day." 

"/ mt the way I am ?" Polly 
laughed, poking her bare toes out 
from under her bathrobe. 

WHILE Jim helped her with 
her sandboots and parka, 
Tony wrapped the baby for his first 



MARS CHILD 



trip outdoors. They were ready 
quickly, but Marian 'had been even 
quicker. When they opened the 
front door, they were confronted by 
a crowd of familiar faces. It seemed 
as if all of Sun Lake Gty Colony's 
eleven dozen residlents had crowded 
into the street in front of the doctor's house. They were determined, 
apparently, that whatever happened 
next week, the Kandros* homecoming would not be spoiled today. 

"I suppose you all want to see the 
baby? All right," Tony told them, 
"but remember, he's still too young 
for much social life. I don't want 
you to crowd around. If you'll all 
spread out down the street from 
here to the Kandros" place, everybody can get a look." 

Together, Tony and Jim eased 
Polly into the rubber tired handtruck that did double duty as a hospital st r etch er . They pi ac ed th e 
baby in her arms, and adjusted the 
small portable tank for the oxy 
mask at her feet. Then they started 
slowly down the long curved street, 
stopping every few yards along the 
way for someone who wanted to 
shake Jim's hand, pat Polly on the 
shoulder, and peer curiously at the 
few square inches of 'the baby's face 
that were exposed to the weather. 

The doctor fretted at the continual delays; he didn't want Polly 
or the baby to stay out too long. 
But after the first few times, he 
found he could speed things up by 
saying meaningfully, "Let's let 
them get home now." As the small 



party progressed down the street, 
they collected a trailing crowd. 
Everyone was determined to be in 
on the big surprise. 

Polly and Jim didn't let diem 
down cither. The moment of dazed 
surprise when they saw the still-wet 
walls of the new room jutting out 
from their house was all that could 
be asked. Equally satisfying were 
the expressions on their faces when 
they opened their door and looked 
in at the array of gifts. 

Some of the new plastic furniture was not in evidence — it was 
still curing in the electronic furnace. 
But the crib was finished, and 
it stood in the center of the 
room, its gleaming transparent sides 
proudly displaying the blankets and 
baby-clothes, d iapers, sheets, and 
towels piled up inside. On the table, 
jars and dishes stood side by side 
with new plastic safety pins and an 
assortment — somewhat premature — 
of baby toys. 

Tony gave them time to take it 
all in, then insisted that the door 
be closed and Polly and the baby be 
allowed to settle down. While he 
was unwrapping the baby, he hoard 
them in whispered consultation, and 
a moment later the door opened 
again. Jim left it very slightly ajar 
behind him as he stepped out, so 
they could hear what went on. 

"TTTAIT a minute, folks," Tony 
VV heard him call. A slight 
hesitation, and then Jim's voice 
again. "Polly and I — well, we want 




 



to thank you, and I don't know just 
how to go about it. I can't really 
say 'I'm surprised, because it's exactly the kind of thing a man might 
know you folks would do. Polly and 
I, when we came here — well, we'd 
never had much to do with politics 
or anything like that. We joined 
up because we wanted to get away, 
mostly. 

"We — I guess you all know how 
long we've been waiting for this 
kid. When he didn't come, back 
there on Earth, we felt like we had 
no roots anywheres, and we just— wanted to get away, that's all. When 
we signed up we figured it sounded 
good. A bundli of people all out 
to help each other and work together, and the way the Statute 
says, extend the frontiers of man by 
mutual endeavor. It made us feel 
more like we belonged, more like 
a family, than just working for 
some Mars Company would have 
(been. 

"It wasn't until after we got 
here that we began to find out 
what it was all abour, and I guess 
you know we liked it. Building up 
this place, everybody working together — it just couldn't ever get 
done that way back on Earth. 

"And then this other thing happened, and the doc said it looked 
like it was going to work out all 
right this time. 

"We- started thinking then, and 
this is what I've been working up 
to. Maybe it's silly, but we figure 
it's something about Mars that made 



it work, or something about the 
Colony. And now the baby's here, 
I hope none of you will mind, but 
we'd like to name him Sun Lake 
City Colony Kandro ..." 

Jim stopped abruptly, and for a 
toodong moment there was only the 
grim silence of the crowd, the same 
bitter thought in every mind. 

Then he went on: "Maybe you 
folks think that's not a very good 
idea right now. I don't know. If you 
don't like it, we won't do It. But 
the way we feel, Polly and me — 
well, we know things look bad now, 
but they're going to have an awful 
hard time, the Planetary Affairs 
Commission or anybody else, getting us off Mars." 

"You're damned well right, 
Jim!" shouted Nick Cantrella. He 
faced the crowd with ihis fists hanging alertly. "Anybody think the kid 
shouldn't be called Sua Like City 

Colony Kandro?" 

The harsh silence broke in a roar 
of confidence that: lifted Tony's 
chin, even though he knew there 
was no justification for it. 

CHAPTER EIGHT 

INSIDE, the baby was wailing 
lustily again. From 3ier .position 
on the couch, Polly raised a commanding arm. 

* 'Turn him over, Jim. He'll probably stop crying if you put him on 
his tummy." 

Tony watched while the new father slid ihis hand under his son's

back with an exquisite caution that 
belied his proud air of assurance. 
Turning to hide his smile, the 
doctor began piling hospital equipment on the hand-truck, to take 
back with him when he went, 

"Look! Tony, look! Look at 
Sunny!" 

"Sunny, is it?" The doctor turned 
around slowly. "So he's lost all his 
dignity already. I was wondering 
how you were going to get around 
that tongue-twister of a name . . . 
Well, what do you know?" 

HE WATCHED the baby struggle briefly, then rear back and 
lift his head upright. He had to admit there was cause for the pride in 
Polly's voice when a baby not yet 
two days old could do that. 

"Well," the doctor teased, "he's 
Sun Lake City Colony Kandro, after 
all. You ask anybody in town if that 
doesn't make a difference, I won't 
be surprised if he walks next week, 
and starts doing long division the 
first of the month. Who knows, he 
might learn how to eat pretty soon !" 

He reali2ed abruptly he'd made a 
mistake. Neither parent was ready 
to joke about that. 

' 'Doc,' ' Jim asked hesitantly, 
"you're pretty sure there's nothing 
wrong?" 

"1 told you before," Tony said 
shortly, "I'm not sure of a blessed 
thing. If you can see any single reason to believe there's anything 
wrong with that baby, I wish 
you'd tell me, because I can't, but —

this is Mars. I can't make promises, and I'll make damned few flat 
statements. You can go along with 
me and trust me, or — " There was 
no alternative, and his brief irritation was already worn out. "You 
can not trust me and go along with 
me. We have to feel our way, that's 
all. Now." he said briskly, "you're 
all checked out on the mask? No 
trouble with it ?" 

"No, it's all right. I'm sorry, 
Doc—" 

"Got enough tanks?" Tony interrupted. 

"You gave us enough to go from 
here to Jupiter," Polly put in. "Listen, Tony, please don't think we — " 

"What I think," Tony told her, 
"is that you're good parents, naturally concerned about your child, 
and that I had no business blowing 
off. Now let's forget it." 

"No," Jim said firmly. "I think 
you ought to know how we — I 
mean there's no question in anyone's mind about trusting you. Hell, 
how do I go about saying this? 
What I want to tell you is — " 

"He wants to say," said Polly 
from the bed, "that we're both very 
grateful for what you've done. It's a 
happiness we thought we'd never 
know." 

"That's it," said Jim. 

"He's your baby," said 'Dr. Tony. 
"Do a good job with him." He 
pushed the hand-truck to the door, 
and waited for Jim to come and 
help him ease it through. "Oh, by 
the way," he added, smiling, "I'll

fill out the birth certificate tonight, 
now that I know the name, if you'll 
come over and . . ." 

"Doer 

IT WAS Hank Radcliff, running 
down the street breathless and 
distraught. 

"Doc, come quick — Joan's dying!" 

Tony grabbed his black bag and 
raced down the street with Hank 
plowing along beside him. 

"What happened?" 

"When I took her out in the tote 
truck," Hank panted, "before she 
could walk to the street, she toppled 
right over — " 

"Walk? You let her walk?" 

"But she told me you said it was 
all right!" The youngster seemed 
close to tears. 

"Joan told you that?" They 
slowed in front of the Radcliff hut. 
Tony wiped the anger off his face 
and went in. 

Joan was on the bunk in a parka; 
the doctor stripped it off and applied his stethoscope. He had adrenalin into her heart in thirty seconds 
and then sat, grim-faced, at the 
edge of the bunk, not taking the 
black disk from her chest. 

"Get that coffee/ - he snapped at 
Hank without turning. "The stuff 
they found in the shakedown." 

Hank raced oui. 

A f tcr I on g mi n u t cs , Ton y exhalcd heavily and put away the 
stethoscope. She'd pulled through 
once more. 



The girl lifted her parchment like 
eyelids and looked at him dully. "I 
feel better now," she whispered, "I 
giicss T fainted." 

"You don't have to talk." Tony 
sat again on the edge of the bed. 

She was silent for a minute, lying 
back with her eyes closed. He 
picked up her bird's claw of a hand; 
the pulse was racing now. 

"Doctor Tony?" she asked. 

"I'm right here. Don't try to 
talk. Go to sleep." 

"Is Hank here?" 

"He'll be back in a minute. 

"I want to tell you something, 
Doctor Tony. It wasn't his fault. I 
didn't tell him the truth. I told him 
you said it was all right for me to 
walk." 

"You knew better than that." 

"Yes. Yes, I did. I know you'll 
have to send me back to Earth — " 

"Never mind about that, Joan." 

"I do, Doctor Tony. Not for mc; 
for Hank. That's why I did it. I'd 
go back for the Colony because it 
isn't fair of mc to take up all your 
time, but what about Hank? If I 
went back, he'd have to go back, 
too. He couldn't stay here in the 
Colony if I were on Earth — alive." 

"What arc you talking about?" 
demanded the doctor, though he 
knew with terrible certainty what 
she meant — what she had tried to 
do. "Of course he's going back 
with you. He loves you. Don't you 
love him?" 

She smiled a little and said softly, 
without urgency, "Yes, I love him." 




 



And then, again hysterically: "But 
this is what he's wanted all his life. 
He doesn't feel the way I do about 
the Colony, the wonderful way 
we're all working together for 
everybody. "With him it's Mars, ever 
since he was a little boy. He's in the 
Colony and he works hard and 
everybody likes him, but it would 
be enough for him to be a prospector like old Lcaroyd. Ever since he 
was a little boy he used to dream 
about it. You know how he's always 
going out into the desert — 

"Tell him he doesn't have to go 
back with mc! Tell him I'll be all 
right. Talk to the shareholders. 
Make them let him stay. It would 
break his heart to send him back." 

T}NY didn't dare excite her by 
telling her Chat they might all 
be sent back, that the Colony was a 
failure. Even if they pulled through 
by a miracle, Hank couldn't stay. 

They called it the "M or M" 
rule — "married or marriageable." 
Far from the lunacies of the jampacked Earth, they had meant to 
build with children and allowed no 
place for new immigrant women 
past childbearing — or for Hank in 
love with a woman returned to 
Earth. It didn't matter now, he 
thought. 

Wearily, he lied, "They wouldn't 
make him go back if he didn't want 
to. But he'd want to go himself." 

She sighed and closed her eyes. 
It seemed a long time before he was 
sure she was asleep. 



Hank was waiting in the living 
room with the coffee. 

"She'll be all right for a while," 
Tony told him. "She's asleep now, 
I think." He looked at the open 
doorway and added, "Come outside 
a minute." 

Sitting on the tote truck, he said, 
"Give her one cup of coffee each 
day as long as it lasts. After any 
meal. It'll make her feel better. 
God, I wish I knew what else we 
could do. That stuff from Benoway 
didn't have any effect. I'm sorry I 
sent you all the way out there." 

"That's all right, Doc. There was 
a chance. And I like seeing the 
country." 

"You certainly do. You should 
have been one of the pork-andbeaners." 

"Hell, Doc, I like it fine here in 
the Colony!" 

Liked it, yes. It was on Mars. 
Tell him or not? wondered Tony. 
Young man, your wife tried to commit suicide so you would be free to 
slay on this planet. And what do 
you think of that? 

The hell with it. What he didn't 
know wouldn't hurt him, upset him, 
make him feel guilty — 

"Doc, do you think we trill have 
to go back ? ' ' Hank's voice was 
more than strained, it was desperate. 

Tony stared. "It looks that way 
right now, Hank. But we have three 
weeks. Something — anything — may 
happen. I'm not giving up hope." 

But the young man's face was 
tortured as Tony left him.

JOAN RAD CLIFF had wanted 
death and been cheated of it by 
adrenalin. Sunny Kandro wanted 
life, which meant his mother's 
breast, but some savage irony was 
cheating him, too. Newly born, five 
pounds of reflexes depending on 
the key suckling reflex that somehow was scrambled. 

Sunny lay awake without crying, 
didn't seem to need sleep, could 
lift his head — all right, put that 
down to lighter gravity, even 
though the Bergens' little Loretta 
hadn't done it. Sunny had a wonderful color, a powerful nursing instinct — but he choked and gagged 
at the breast. Without fuel the machine of reflexes would run down 
and stop . . . 

It didn't make sense to Tony. He 
had guiltily half-lied to the Kandros 
when he told them many babies 
didn't know how to nurse at first. 
That was the truth; the lie was that 
this baby knew how, but choked all 
the same. A feeding problem, they 
would have blandly called it on 
Earth, where there still were millions of cows, sterile hospitals, relays of trained nurses for intravenous nourishment regimes. Here 
a feeding problem was a feeding 
problem. 

Anyone of the wealthier industrial colonies would automatically 
have taken Earth-import powdered 
milk from its stores, but Sun Lake 
couldn't afford it, didn't have any. 



And what was more. Sun Lake 
wouldn't get powdered milk if 
Commissioner Bell made good on 
his threat . . . 

If Sunny died, it would be worse 
than the unnamed little boy the 
Connollys had lost, and he had 
left a scar on the doctor's mind 
that time would never heal. Tony 
could still see the agonized blue 
face and the butterfly gasping for 
air — a preemie, but he never should 
have cleared Mrs. Connolly, seven 
months gone, until they'd had oxygen cylinders and masks and a tent 
for emergencies. 

The Connollys had shipped back 
to Earth on the next rocket after 
the tragedy. 

The father had cursed him insanely, damned him for a killer 
because he hadn't foreseen the need 
of oxy gear for their baby two 
months before it was due. OxEn 
they had, but OxEn made no 
change in the lungs of a baby. He'd 
given it intravenously, orally, in 
every solvent he could lay his 
hands on during the desperate 
hours before the improvised mask 
fed the last trickle of oxygen from 
their single tank into the lungs of 
the infant. 

Tony forced his face into a smile 
as he passed a couple— Flexncr and 
his girl Verna. Behind the smile he 
was thinking that it would be 
harder to bear a muter reproach 
from the patient Kandros than 
Connolly's raging curses. 

Tony dragged the loaded hand


70 




 



truck into the middle of his living 
loom, and left it there. He could 
put the stuff away later; it was 
getting late now, and he had yet 
to make 'his afternoon radiation inspection at the Lab. There was a 
package on the table; he took time 
to pick it up and read: "For Doctor Tony from Jim and Polly 
Kandro — with much thanks." 

For a moment he held it, weighing it in his hand. No, he decided, 
he'd open it later, when there was 
time to relax and appreciate the 
sentiment that lay behind it. The 
gift itself .would be — would have 
to be — meaningless. 

There was no way for any colonist to purchase or procure anything at all from the outside. Except for the very few personal 
treasures that were somehow 
squeezed into the rigid weight limit 
on baggage when they came out, 
all plastic chairs and sinks, blankets, and windows were uniformly 
functional and durable. But they 
were uniform, and they were also 
scarce. Each household contained 
the same irreducible minimum; 
Lab space and work hours were 
■too precious to be used for the 
production of local consumption 
items. 

rjlONY closed his door behind 
JL him, and set out for the Lab 
once more. Dull, monotonous, 
primitive, uncomfortable, he raged 
inwardly. Every home, inside and 
out, just the same! 



Why had they come to Mars? 
For a better, saner way of life, to 
retrieve some of the dignity of 
men, to escape from the complexities and inequities and fear pressures -of Earth. And what were they 
doing? Building a new life, with 
hard work and suffering, on the 
precise pattern of the old. There 
wasn't a person in the Colony who 
wouldn't do better back on Earth, 

He found the Lab in an uproar. 
All work had stopped, so the grim 
hunt for the marcaine could go on. 
Nick had already begun ah inventory. 

"Make this an extra-good check, 
Doc," Tony was told in the office 
before he started out. "We'll be 
handling a lot of stuff that hasn't 
been used in a long time. And getting into all the corners too." 

"Are the checkout tubes racked 
yet?" Tony asked. 

"Right. We issued new ones to 
the men on the inspection squad." 

"I'll do them first," the doctor 
decided, and went into the cleanup 
room where the wall racks were 
already lined with the tubes for that 
day. Usually they were checked in 
the following morning's inspection; 
but today the plant had closed 
down early for all practical purposes. 

The tubes checked clean all down 
the line. 

Tony selected a fresh tube from 
the opposite wall and went on out 
through the shipping room to the" 
workrooms. He didn't need armor 



MARS CHILD 



71 



for the afternoon inspection. The 
technicians had been 4n there working, and if their tubes were all 
clean there couldn't be any deadly 
hot stuff. The purpose of the lateday check was to catch react ion s 
that were just starting up, and 
that might make trouble overnight. 
In the morning it was different. 
Anything that had been chaining 
for twelve or more hours could be 
vicious. 

Back in the office, when he was 
finished, Tony reported a clean 
check through. "What," he asked, 
"are you" going to do about the 
shipment crates?" 

"Leave them till last," Mimi 
Jonathan told him. "If anything 
turns up in the workrooms or storage bins, we'll have to open up 
the shipment crates one at a time. 
Doc, do you think ...?'* 

She stopped, looked down a moment and then back at Tony, with 
a wry smile. "That's silly, isn't it? 
I don't know why I expect you to 
know more about it than I do. Oh, 
listen — they want you to stick 
around and monitor if they do have 
to open the crates. I'll let you know 
when it gets that fax." 

"Okay." Tony smiled back at 
her. "Try to give me more than 
five minutes notice, will you ? I 
wish we had either a full -time 
radiological man or another doctor." 

"How about Harve?" she suggested. "Could lie fill in for you? 
We didn't want to assign him with


out your okay — he hasn't done any 
monitoring on his own yet, has 
he?" 

"No," Tony said thoughtfully. 
"Not yet. But this won't be anything more than standing by with 
a counter and keeping his eyes 
open. I don't see why not; he 
knows the routine as well as I do 
by now. I'd leave it up to him," 
the doctor decided. "If he feels 
ready to take it on, it'll be a big 
help to me." 

"I'll ask him," Mimi promised. 

iti 

THIS afternoon the familiar 
splendors of the Martian scene 
evoked no glowing certainties in 
Tony's mind. He walked back from 
the Lab in the early twilight, his 
eyes fixed on the far hills, his 
■thought roaming bitterly beyond, to 
the other side of the range. 

Tony had been to the new town, 
just once, to help out when a too 
hastily built furnace exploded. The 
injuries had been more than 
Pirtco's green young doctor could 
handle all at once. The doctor's 
inexperience, like the faulty furnace, was typical. The whole place 
was temporary, until it showed a 
profit for Pittco. When it did, solid 
structures would replace the jerrybuilt shacks; an efficient company 
administration would put an end to 
die anarchic social organization. 

But for now the town was just 
a sprawling collection of rani


72 




 



shackle buildings, constructed of a 
dozen different inadequate materials, whatever was available in 
Marsport when a new house was 
needed. There was no thought of 
the future on the other side of the 
hill, no worry about permanence, 
no eye to consequence. 

If the camp went bust, the population would move on to one of the 
newer locations — and move again 
when that collapsed. If, on the 
other hand, the town survived, the 
population would move on anyhow. A new crop of workers would 
be imported from Earth, a tamer, 
quieter crew, to do routine work in 
an organized company town, at 
considerably lower pay. And the 
boom-town adventurers would go, 
to find higher wages and a freer 
life somewhere else. 

They struck no roots there, and 
they wanted none. Of all the widely 
scattered human settlements on 
Mars, the Sun Lake Colony alone 
believed that man could and would 
some day flourish naturally on the 
alien soil. 

Tony Hellman had a religion: it 
was the earnest hope that that day 
would come before he died, that 
he would live to sec them cut the 
cord with Earth. Training and instinct both cried out against the 
new danger of abortion to the 
embryo civilization. 

Tony was a good doctor; in 
Springfield or Jackson City or Hartford — anywhere on Earth — he could 
have written his own ticket. In


stead, he had chosen to throw in 
his lot with a batch of wide-eyed 
idealists; had, indeed, jumped at 
the chance. 

IT WAS largely Tony's eagerness 
to emigrate that was responsible 
for the Colony's "M-or-M" ruling. 
The Sun Lake Society couldn't afford to turn Dr. Hellman down; 
they knew just how slim was the 
possibility of getting another doctor as good. So, after much deliberation, the by-laws were carefully 
revised, and the words "or marriageable" inserted after the word 
"married" in the list of qualifications. 

The modification had resulted 
in a flood of new and highly desirable members. Skilled workers 
were inclined to be more footloose 
and adventurous before they were 
married, before they had settled into responsible, well-paid jobs on 
Earth. Bea Juarez, pilot of the 
Colony's ship, Lazy Girl, was one 
of the new acquisitions; so was 
Harvey Stillman, the chief radioman. 

Anna Willendorf was (mother 
membcr who had come in after Ihc 
revised "M-or-M' ' rul ing, one 
whose skill was almost as much 
appreciated as Tony's, for a different reason. Plastics, produced in the 
Lab, could be, and were, used for 
almost every item of furniture or 
furnishings in the Colony; but for 
some chemical processes, glassware 
was still a must. And now that giant 



MADS CHILD 



73 



machines existed on Earth to- turn 
out almost every conceivable glass 
utensil, glass-blowers were far between, good ones almost nonexistent. Without Anna's highly 
specialized talent, the Colony would 
have had to pay fabulous prices for 
the transport of bulkily packaged 
glassware from Earth. 

Anna was one of the very few 
unmarried members of the Colony 
who refused 'to participate in the 
Communal meals. Laziness, or embarrassment, or both, served to 
drag in the others, like Tony, who 
might have preferred to remain 
aloof. Anna simply ignored the 
questions and remarks. 

ON RARE occasions, however, 
she relented to the extent of 
"inviting" the doctor to dine with 
her — combining their rations, and 
preparing a nual for him in her 
own one-room hut. Then, for an 
hour, she would play hostess to 
him, an hour that restored, for 
both of them, the longed-for feeling of gracious, civilized living. 

"One for all and all for one." 
"Mutual endeavor." "Collective 
self-sufficiency." The whole thing, 
Tony thought angrily, was an 
anachronism; more than that, an 
impossibility. No sane man could 
believe in it — unless he came from 
Earth and had nothing to see to 
believe in. 

For tonight, at least, he was free 
of it. Anna was at the door when 
he reached it, holding it open for 



him. She watched him set down his 
bag as though he were unloading 
the troubles of the Universe. 

"You need a drink," she decided. 

"Who's kidding whom?" He 
grinned sourly at her. "Some nice, 
refreshing, vitamin-packed, GradeA, synthesized orange juke, maybe?" 

"I see you haven't been home 
yet.
She disappeared behind the drape 
that hid her kitchen section. Not 
many of tlicm bothered to separate 
the kitchen from the living room; 
perhaps, Tony thought, that was 
what gave her room such a special 
look. A moment later, she was out 
again, with two long-stemmed 
fragile glasses in her hands. 

SHE handed one to Tony, and 
awe and wonder crossed his 
face as he sipped. He looked Ins 
question at her over the rhn of 
the glass. 

"I shouldn't have spoiled your 
surprise, really." She smiled at him. 
"The Kandros. They wouldn't prepare anything for the baby, but 
they must have ordered these from 
Earth when Polly was just — let's 
see — three months along, to have 
had them here in time." 

"Real wine," Tony marveled, and 
sipped again. "Aged wine. How did 
they get it? How could they afford—?" 

"They couldn't, of course," she 
reminded him, "but they have rela

tives on Earth. You know they're 
not the only ones who left some 
cash behind, 'just in case'?" 

The doctor looked up sharply, 
and found a faint smile flickering 
on her lips. "How did you know?" 
he demanded. "Where do you find 
out these things ?" 

"What do they call it — feminine 
intuition?" She shrugged and 
moved toward the kitchen again. 
"Which also tells me that supper 
will be a desiccated mess if I don't 
serve it right now." 

She had set the table as usual in 
front of the big window. Tony 
took his place and looked out 
through the eerie twilight across 
the endless expanse of Lac us Soiis. 
The ocean bed was like a vast black 
velvet now, studded with a million 
tiny, glinting jewels. 

The doctor stared out until Anna 
returned with a steaming dish. He 
regarded her soberly and was planning a dutiful compliment when 
she burst into laughter and set the 
dish down. "Jim's face," she explained hastily. "It just crossed my 
mind. He's so proud of the wife 
and child — " 

He was irked by a note of insincerity and supposed for a moment — neurotically, he knew; commonest thing in the world — that 
she had been laughing at him. 

"Nothing so funny," he said 
stiffly. 

"I'm sorry. Serve the greens?" 
Dinner performed its usual 
magic. Tony had been really hun


gry. Tilting his chair against the 
wall, with his empty pipe in his 
mouth, he found that things were 
getting back into proportion. 

"Anyhow," he said, "wc still 
have time." They had been talking 
about Bell's threat of quarantine. 
Through the daylight hours it had 
seemed at least the end of the 
world. Now, with a pleasantly noticeable buzz from the wine in his 
head and a palatable meal digesting, above all, with some privacy 
and clear space and time around 
him, Tony couldn't recapture the 
sharp alarm of the threat. 

ANNA, very seriously, demanded, "Do you think Bell 
can run us out ?" 

He waved a little too expansively. "'Prob'ly not. Any number of 
other possibilities. Somebody at 
Pittco might have taken the stuff; 
they're close enough. Nope — " He 
hauled up. "Ed Nealey wouldn't 
make a mistake like that. He was 
working the Bloodhound and 
there's a boy who'll do any job the 
right way. Don't worry about it, 
though. It's two weeks to rocket 
landing, another week to Shipment 
Day — something'll turn up. We'll 
send O'Donnell to Marsport. If 
there's a legal angle he'll find it. 
Maybe he can scare BeJl into backing down. Bell's supposed to be a 
small-timer. He wouldn't want any 
real trouble."' 

Anna got up abruptly and filled 
his empty glass. 



MARS CHILD 



75 



"Hey, you take some too!" Tony 
insisted. 

She made a show of draining the 
last few drops into her own glass; 
the rims touched and they drank. 

"You're a strange girl, Anna," 
said Tony. "Hell, I didn't mean exactly that — I mean you're not like 
the other women here. Joan. Bea. 
Polly. Verna." 

"No," she said. "Not very much 
like Bea." 

Tony didn't know whether she 
was angry or amused and decided 
he didn't care. "I don't know why 
I don't marry you." 

"Two reasons," Anna smiled. 
"One, you're not sure you want to. 
Two, you're not at all sure I do." 

The sudden banging on the door 
was like an explosion in the quiet 
room. Harve Stillman didn't wait 
fox anyone to answer; he burst in. 



He was white-faced and shaken. 
"Doc!" 

Tony jumped up and reached for 
his bag. "What is it? Joan? The 
baby? An accident at the Lab?" 

"Flash from Marsport. The rocket's coming in." The radio man 
stopped to catch his breath. 
"They're inside radio range now. 
Estimated time of arrival, 4:00 
A.M." 

"Tomorrow?" Anna gasped. 

Harve nodded and Tony put 
down his bag with mechanical precision in the center of the table. 

Tomorrow! Three weeks had 
been little enough time to find the 
marcaine and the thief and get rid 
of Bell's strangling cordon. Now, 
with the rocket in ahead of schedule, two of those weeks were 
yanked out from under them!

Africa's Mysterious 
Mammal 

By WILLY LEY 



IT IS, of course, just the accident of Dutch spelling which 
puts the aardvark in the number one place in any Natural History index. But if strangeness were 
the deciding factor — strangeness of 
appearance, of habits or of position in the zoological system — the 



aardvark would also land in the 
first place. 

There are three living varieties of 
aardvarks and their scientific designation is Orycteropus. The term 
is derived from a word in classical

AFRICA'S MYSTERIOUS MAMMAL 



T7 



may be simply translated as "the 
digger." 

The smallest of the three living 
varieties is Orycteropus aethiopicus, 
living, as indicated by the generic 
name, in North East Africa. The 
Cape aardvark, Orycteropus afer or 
Orycteropus capensis, is considerably larger, five to six feet long, 
and was the first to become known. 
Most recent addition is Orycteropus 
crikssonii, or Eriksson's aardvark, 
which is the largest of the three 
and lives in the dense forest of the 
Wele, Mubangi and Ituri regions 
of Central Africa. 

Considering the location and nature of the last one's habitat, it is 
not surprising that it "was discovered as recently as 1905. The other 
two just crept up on science, the 
year of discovery not being known. 

This is strange in the case of the 
Ethiopian variety. Except for 
Egypt and the Mediterranean shore 
of the African continent, no other 
part of Africa was known for as 
long a time as Ethiopia. But even 
around the middle of the last century the Ethiopians themselves were 
mostly doubtful about the aardvark. 
An Austrian traveler, Thcodor von 
Heuglin, was told by natives that 
in their country there was a flesheating beast, with the head of a 
crocodile, the ears of a donkey and 
the tail of a monkey. 

Since von Heuglin guessed at 
once that it might be Orycteropus 
(he was not acquainted with the 
now common Dutch name) it is 



clear that its existence was known 
to him. His guess was based essentially on the donkey ears and he 
correctly put down the item of the 
crocodile's head to a desire to conform with the alleged flesh-eating 
habits. He also noted, which is inreresting, that the natives who just 
told the story about it referred to 
it as Tirghileb. The others who actually knew the animal had another 
name for it; they called it A bu 
Delaf, "Father of Nails," which 
makes sense to anybody who has 
ever seen the aardvark's digging 
claws. 

THE actual year of discovery of 
the Cape aardvark is not known 
either, but there is an early report 
about it which seems to be completely unknown to most zoologists. It can be found in a folio 
volume which was published in 
Germany in 1719. Its title reads, 
translated, Description of the Cape 
of Good Hope, and its author was 
a pastor, Peter Koib. After his return to his native country he acquired the title of Magister and 
also became Rector of a school in 
a small town. 

Magister Peter Kolb must have 
had voluminous notes and the 
book he wrote must have been 
rather tedious even for the literary 
tastes of his contemporaries. An 
anonymous Frenchman published a 
set of three volumes of excerpts, 
translated into French — and badly, 
if one is to trust the verdict of the 




 



original publisher Peter Conrad 
Monath, who then proceeded to 
bring out a still heavy volume of 
excerpts in German, published in 
1745. 

Because Magister Kolb's report 
has never been republished or even 
quoted since its original appearance, it pays to do so now. It may 
be remarked first that the book is 
chiefly concerned with the natives 
of the area that is now the Union 
of South Africa. The zoological 
aspect creeps in via their domesticated animals, which leads to a 
chapter on "the ferocious and cruel 
animals" of the area. Finally Part 
III, Chapter 5 is devoted to such 
animals as are neither domesticated 
nor "cruel." It has several subdivisions, one of which is called "On 
the Pigs" and it says that there are 
four kinds of pigs in the area. Two 
of them have been introduced by 
Man, one from Java and one from 
Europe. The third kind is the 
"Spiny Pig" (the porcupine) and 
then: 

The fourth kind is called the 
Earth Pig. It somewhat resembles the red pigs one meets 
in some places in Europe. But 
it has a longer skull and 
sharper snout, but no teeth 
{Kolb means tusks] and few 
bristles. The tail is long, the 
legs are long and strong. It 
lives in the ground where it 
makes a burrow with great 
speed. As soon as it has its 
head and fore limbs in the 
hole, it can hold on so fast 



that even the strongest man 
cannot pull it out. Should it 
be hungry, it will look for 
an ant-hill. [Kolb means 
termite hill.} When it has 
found one, it looks around 
whether there is any danger 
. . . then it lies dow and extends its tongue as far as it 
can. The ants crawl upon the 
tongue. When there arc 
enough, the animal pulls the 
tongue in and swallows them. 
This it continues to do until 
it is fully sated ... Its flesh 
has a delicious taste, almost | 
like that of our wild hogs, 
and is very healthy. The Eu- / 
ropeans and the Hottentots 
often hunt these animals. 
They are easy to kill by 
means of hitting them over 
the head with a stick. 

THE term "earth pig" used by 
Kolb is, of course, a straight 
translation of the Dutch word 
aardvark, and the Dutch used that 
name because the hindlegs of the 
animal can be and are smoked like 
hams. (Mrs. Ley insists that that 
must be "the ham what ain't.**) 

Strangely enough Magister Kolb's 
simple account was not believed 
When the French naturalist Count 
Buffon assembled the material for 
his great natural history work, he 
knew of Kolb's story, presumably 
via the French translation of excerpts, but decided that the animal 
was mythical. 

This decision could hardly have 
been prompted by Kolb's account, 



AFRICA'S MYSTERIOUS MAMMAL 



77 



but Buffon may have heard from 
other sources that the animal was 
up to six feet long and lived in 
burrows in spite of its size. He may 
have been told that it has donkey's 
ears, independently movable, that 
it has long black hair, but so sparse 
that the skin can be seen through 
it. That it has a tail as heavy as a 
crocodile's tail, that it could dig so 
fast that even a strong man armed 
with a spade could not keep up 
with it, not counting the minor 
annoyance that the digging animal, 
keeping ahead of him, throws the 
soil it excavates frantically into the 
pursuer's face. Count Buffon may. 
have been told that aardvarks, after 
feeding, "dance" in the moonlight 
And that, when pursued above 
ground, they run half -erect on their 
hind legs for a short distance. 

Except for this bipedal running, 
which is still somewhat in doubt, 
all these things were and are perfectly true, but Buffon may have 
found the composite picture entirely too much. 

The volume in question had just 
been printed and bound when another German, a traveling surgeon 
by the name of Peter Simon Pallas, 
came to the aardvark's defense. 
Peter Simon Pallas had been elected to the Royal Society when only 
2 3 years old, which commanded respect. The book in which he described the aardvark was written in 
Latin and was published in The 
Hague in 1766. Buffon, in later editions of his own work, accepted the 



aardvark on Pallas' authority — 
which must understandably have 
been a psychological strain — which 
had the result that later writers 
thought Pallas had furnished the 
first mention, or the first description, or even that he had discovered 
it personally. 

Although all aardvarks arc nocturnal, a specimen may be encountered in daylight on occasion. The 
English traveler Henry Drummond has left the following account of such a chance meeting: 

. . . My dog did not pay any 
attention to my calls and I 
saw an animal which I could 
not recognize at once jump 
up in the high grass and run 
away. My dog chased it for 
several hundred paces and 
then stopped in front of one 
of the numerous holes . . . 
The tracks then told me that 
it had been an aardvark. I 
first tried to smoke it out of 
its apparently shallow burrow, but this attempt failed. 
Then 1 sent the Kaffir who 
was with me back for spades 
and while waiting I heard the 
aardvark dig continuously for 
two hours. When the men 
finally returned with tools I 
ordered them to dig, but after 
half an hour it became clear 
that we could not catch it 
that way. I changed my 
method, listened wher" the 
animal was and had a vertical hole dug about three feet 
in front of its position. After 
another hour we had come 



80 




 



so close that the aardvark 
stopped digging, retreated 
and came out of the burrow. 
I then killed it with a shot. 

THE adult aardvark does not 
seem to have any other enemies 
than the natives, but the young are 
easy prey for pythons, which have 
the proper shape for entering the 
burrows. While aardvarks are not 
too difficult to keep in a zoological 
garden,, they don't make much of 
an exhibit because they tend to 
sleep all day long — and, more exasperating, even, dig a hole for 
this purpose. 

In nature the aardvark does not 
seem to exert much effort to find 
its own burrow when the sun 
rises; it is too easy to dig another 
one. Some observers have expressed 
the belief that each aardvark has a 
number of burrows, anyway. Others 
have thought that all the burrows 
may be common property. 

Of the Cape aardvark it is believed that it gives birth to only 
one young. We are sure, however, 
about that fact as regards the 
Ethiopian variety because of Theodor von Heuglin's observations. He 
reported that the single young is 
born in May or June, that it is 
suckled for a long time and that it 
is most hairy, having almost a/fur, 
when one year old. After that the 
hair is lost rapidly, so that the 
pinkish skin can be seen. [ 

When von Heuglin was in 
Abyssinia, he kept one in captivity 



for a long time, feeding it with 
milk, honey, dates and other fruit, 
in addition to the insects which it 
found itself. He wrote that it soon 
followed him around and amused 
all onlookers by its grotesque 
jumps. But, as usual, it slept most 
of the day. It always buried its 
droppings and von Heuglin noticed 
that the shallow hole dug for this 
purpose was dug with the hind feet 
and then covered up with the front 
feet. When it came to -digging for 
a shelter, the fore feet did most of 
the work. 

While this variety lives in the 
mountainous and dry country of 
Abyssinia, and the Cape variety in 
the open veldt of the South, 
Eriksson's aardvark has made the 
tropical humid heat of the Rain 
Forest its home. It is almost devoid of hairs and its skin is not 
pink like that of the others, but 
brick red. closely matching the red 
soil of Africa. It has shorter, more 
piglike ears, and, while more massive in general build, it has a much 
thinner tail than the two others. 
One, shot in the Ituri Forest by the 
British naturalist Cuthbert Christy 
in 19 1 2. measured eight f eet in 
length and Christy found tracks of 
an even larger specimen. 

ALL this added up to a tight 
little group of very strange 
animals, but the real mystery was — 
which animal outside that group, 
living or extinct, had to be regarded as the nearest relative? Ob


AFRICAS MYSTERIOUS MAMMAL

viously the aardvarks had to have 
relatives. But what were they? 
Fossils did not help much. The 
best known fossil type, excavated 
from the soil of the island of 
Samos, from the mainland of 
Greece and even from Persian soil, 
is called Orycteropus gaudry). 
When, in 1888, it was described 
for the first time, the description 
stated that "except for its much 
smaller size, it differs little from 
the living Cape variety." Later 
work has shown that there are numerous minor differences, but it is 
still true that the Samos aardvark, 
if it were found alive, would simply be a fourth aardvark. 

In 1918 W. D. Matthew made 
the original statement that the 
aardvarks may be very primitive 
ungulates, i.e. hoofed mammals. 
This idea is now generally accepted, and received much support 
some twenty years after it was first 
uttered because the San Juan Basin 
of New Mexico yielded the remains of a large mammal which 
was called Ectoconus. It was a very 
early mammal, belonging to the ancestral group of the hoofed 
mammals of our time. Although it 
had a lighter tail, and although its 
legs and feet were not adapted to 



digging, it bore a strong resemblance in general appearance and 
in bodily proportions Lo the living 
aardvarks. In size it ranked with 
the Ituri forest giants. 

PROF. MATTHEW did not 
claim that his Ectoconus wzs the 
ancestor of the African digger: 
*'This general resemblance does not 
involve any near relationship, but 
indicates merely that the modern 
Orycteropus has retained with little 
alteration much of the proportions 
and structure that were common 
among primitive placcntals of similar size." 

And thus the animal doubted by 
Buffon and later shunted from 
place to place in zoology books 
turned out to be a somewhat modified image of a group of very early 
mammals, completely extinct otherwise. Their hoofed offspring has 
roamed all over Earth since then, 
excepting only Antarctica and the 
Australian region. But the leftover 
of the original type had to go underground to persist. 

If I had merely read accounts of 
the animal without having seen 
specimens, I think I would not believe in aardvarks.

GALAXY'S 
STAR 



SHELF 



THE FOUR-SIDED TRIANGLE, 
by William F. Temple. Frederick 
Fell, Inc., New York, 1951. 240 
pages, $2.75. 

I FIND it difficult not to go off 
the deep end about this novel. 
It is one of the best written (when 
the British write well they write 
magnificently) and warmest, most 
brilliantly charactered and humanly 
real science fiction tales I have read 
since S. Fowler Wright's completely 
dissimilar Deluge. With (his book, 
Temple becomes a British novelist 
in the grand tradition. Make no 
mistake, you will never forget the 
book or its people. 

Since the jacket blurb gives away 
the novel's plot in the first para


graph, there is no reason why the 
reviewer shouldn't, also. Very aimply, it is based on the idea that two 
men in love wtih the same girl invent .i mutter-duplicating machine 
and make a duplicate of the girl, as 
well as of other things. 

Temple tells the story through 
the eyes of a wonderful elderly 
physician who is general practitioner 
for the whole community where the 
action takes plate. In addition to 
the doctor, the book gives us a 
^roup of people so poignantly real 
that they actually seem to come alive 
on the page. There is the brilliant, 
lovable, erratic boy who is a born 
scientist and a born fool; there is 
the son of an old country family 
who exemplifies everything that is

good and bad about the traditional 
British gentleman; and there is a 
girl — well, wait till you read the 
book. She is surely one of the most 
original and most desirable creations in any recent novel, science 
fiction or otherwise. 

H. L. Gold has defined adult science fiction as: fiction that is based 
on credible characters with believable motivations, whose conflicts 
and problems are the result of a 
projected environment, with which 
their attempts to find a solution, 
and the solution itself, are logically 
consistent. The Four-Sided Triangle 
fits that definition as perfectly as 
any science fiction I have ever read. 

DRAGONS IN AMBER, by Willy 
Ley. The Viking Press, N ew 
York, 1951. 320 pages, $3.75. 

mo THOSE who are familiar 
-L with The Lungfisb, the Dodo 
and the Unicorn, this new collection 
of "Adventures of a romantic naturalist" (as the book's subtitle describes it) will come as a welcome 
and long-awaited second helping of 
something already tasted and found 
good. For strangers to Willy Ley as 
a wanderer down the byways of 
paleontology, piscatology, vulcanology, and a lot of other natural ologies, who know him only as one of 
the nation's outstanding rocket experts, the book will come as an unexpected treat, a rich and flavorsome 
one. 

In that completely charming, 



slightly Europeanized English which 
makes Willy Ley such a fine and individual stylist, we are told of the 
incredible life cycle of eels; the curious history and prehistory of amber; 
the paleontological parade of the 
camel and his kin (did you know 
that the camel is supposed to have 
originated in the Americas, and 
emigrated to Asia?); the hair-raising story of Krakatoa, the volcano 
that blew itself to bits, and how the 
remains were soon repopulated with 
all kinds of flora and fauna; and 
many more marvels— -itntenmoths, 
pandas, ichthyosaurs, milus, takahes, 
ginkos, and so on. 

The book is a must for anyone 
who is curious about the natural 
world we live in and the strange 
things it contains. 

THE STARS LIKE DUST, by 
Isaac Asimov. Doubleday & Co., 
New York, 1951. 218 pages, 
$2.50. 

THIS workmanlike, complex 
weaving of a possible pattern 
of tomorrow first appeared as 
Tyrann, GALAXY's second .booklength serial. Its publication between hard covers is fit reward for 
what is a fust-rate piece of imaginative story-telling. 

There is nothing in any particular unprecedented about Asimov's 
newest. It falls into the Grand 
Tradition of galactic empire romances which was founded in the 
first place by the grandiose E. E. 



84 




 



Smith, Ph.D. — a tradition which 
is already one of the richest in 
science fiction, being most magnificently exemplified by Asimov's own 
earlier "Foundation" series. 

The present tale imagines a fardistant future in which a brilliantly 
ruthless people, the Tyranni, arc 
in the process of taking over the 
Galaxy with their advanced astroaval sciences. That Tyrann will 
eventually be defeated goes without 
question. However, the intricate 
travails and treasons, conspiracies 
and confrontations, assassinations 
and assignations which lead up to 
the victory- before-the- final -victory 
(the latter being left to the reader's 
imagination) make for reading of 
the can't-put-it-down school. 

THE MAN WHO SOLD THE 
MOON, by Robert A. Hsinlein. 
Shasta Publishers, Chicago, 1950, 

\. 288 pages, $3.00. 

HEINLEIN fans (and who 
isn't?) will not want to miss 
this one as your reviewer did in 
the flurry of setting up the first 
schedule of reviews for GALAXY 
last summer. It is the first volume 
in the "Future History" on which 
the author has been working, on 
and off, since 1939. It contains 
some of the most memorable of 
Robert Heinlein's-Anson MacDonald's shorter stories and novelettes. 

To people who know Hcinlein 
only through his slick magazine 



stories, those in this collection will 
come as a revelation; to fans who 
are already happily familiar with 
some or all of these Astounding 
Science Fiction tales, the book will 
be a handsomely bound method of 
storing them permanently against 
the many coming days of re-reading. -. 

WHEH WORLDS COLLIDE, by 

Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer. 
J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, 1951, 690 pages, $2.95. 

FIRST published in 1931 and 
1932, the two volumes which, 
combined, comprise this fat, lowpriced reprint reveal a richly melodramatic story, an outstanding example of early science fiction for 
the slick magazine' audience. 

The tales tell of the complete destruction* of Earth by one of two 
wandering planets from outer 
space, and the establishment on the 
other wanderer of a small nexus of 
human civilization to "carry on" as 
the new planet takes up its orbit 
around our sun. Though marred 
somewhat by the inclusion of our 
present international tensions, it 
still tells a thrilling story and tells 
it well. 

All in all, an excellent month 
for science fiction books — your reviewer's gall-point pen, which 
writes with acid under literary 
strain, has been gladly laid aside.

"Oh, that doesn't matter. I ate 
something on the way home. But, 
Drake, we're going to have him 
here!" 

"Who here? What are you talking about?" 

HOSTESS 



"The doctor from Hawkin's 
Planet! Didn't you realize that was 
what today's conference was about? 
We spent all day talking about it. 
It's the most exciting thing ilia I. 
could possibly have happened!" 

Drake Smollett removed the pipe 
from the vicinity of his face. He 
stared first at it and then at his 
wife. "Let me get this straight. 
"When you say the doctor from 
Hawkin's Planet, do you mean the 
Hawkinsite you've got at the Institute?" 

"Well, of course. Who else 
could I possibly mean?" 

"And may I ask what the devil 
you mean by saying we'll have him 
here ?" 

"Drake, don't you understand?" 

"What is there to understand ? 
Your Institute may be interested in 
the thing, but I'm not. What have 
we to do with it personally? It's 
Institute business, isn't it?" 

"But, darling," Rose said, patiently, "the Hawkinsite would like 
to stay at a private house somewhere, where he won't be bothered 
with official ceremony, and where 
he'll be able to proceed more according to his own likes and 
dislikes. I find it quite understandable." 

"Why at our house?" 

"Because our place is convenient 
for the purpose, I suppose. They 
asked i f I would allow it, and 
frankly," she added with some 
stiffness, "I consider it a privilege." 

"Look!" Drake put his fingers 

as 



through his brown hair and succeeded in rumpling it. "We've got 
a convenient little place here — 
granted! It's not the most elegant 
place in the world, but It does well 
enough for us. However, I don't see 
where we've got room for extraterrestrial visitors." 

ROSE began to look worried. 
She removed, her glasses and 
put them away in their case. "He 
can stay in the spare room. He'll 
take care of it himself. I've spoken 
to him and he's very pleasant. Honestly, ail wc have to do is show a 
certain amount of adaptability." 

Drake said, "Sure, just a little 
adaptability! The Hawkinsites 
breathe cyanide. We'll just adapt 
ourselves to that, I suppose!" 

"He carries the cyanide in a little 
cylinder. You won't even notice it." 

"And what else about them that 
I won't notice?" 

"Nothing else. They're perfectly ' 
harml es s . Goodnes s , they' re even 
vegetarians." 

"And what does that mean? Do 
we feed him a bale of hay for 
dinner ?" 

Rose's lower lip trembled. 
"Drake, you're being deliberately 
hateful. There are many vegetarians 
on Earth; they don't eat hay." 

"And what about us? Do we eat 
meat ourselves or will that make us 
look like cannibals to him? I won't 
live on salads to suit him; I warn 
you." 

"You're being quite ridiculous." 

 



Rose felt helpless. She had 
married late in life, comparatively. 
Her career had been chosen; she 
herself had seemed well settled in 
It. She was a fellow in biology at 
the Jenkins Institute for the Natural Sciences, with over twenty 
publications to her credit. In a 
word, the line was hewed, the path 
cleared; she had been set for a 
career and spinster/hood. And now, 
at 35, she was still a little amazed 
to find herself a bride of less than 
a year. 

Occasionally, it embarrassed her, 
too, since she sometimes found that 
she had not die slightest idea of 
how to handle her husband. What 
did one do when the man of the 
family became mulish? That was 
not included in any of her courses. 
As a woman of independent mind 
and career, she couldn't bring herself to cajolery. 

So she looked at him steadily 
and said simply, "It means very 
much to me." 

"Why?" 

"Because, Drake, if he stays here 
for any length of time, I can study 
him really closely. Very little work 
has been done on the biology and 
psychology of the individual Hawkinsite or of any of the extraterrestrial intelligences. We have some 
on their sociology and history, of 
course, but that's all. Surely, you 
must see the opportunity. He stays 
here; we watch him, speak to him, 
observe his habits — " 

"Not interested." 



"Oh, Drake, I don't understand 
you." 

"You're going to say I'm not 
usually like this, I suppose." 
"Well, you're not." 

DRAKE was silent for a while. 
He seemed withdrawn and his 
high cheekbones and large chin 
were twisted and frozen into a 
brooding position. 

He said, finally, ".Look, I've 
heard a bit about the Hawkinsites 
in the way of my own business. You 
say there have been investigations 
of their sociology, but not of their 
biology. Sure. It's because the 
Hawkinsites don't like to be studied 
as specimens any more than we 
would. I've spoken to men who 
were in charge of security groups 
watching various Hawkinsite missions on Earth. The missions stay 
in the rooms assigned to them and 
don't leave for anything but the 
most important official business. 
They have nothing to do with 
Earthmen. It's quite obvious that 
they are as revolted by us as I personally am by them. 

"In fact, I just don't understand 
why this Hawkinsite at the Institute should be any different. It 
seems to me to be against all the 
. rules to have him come here by 
himself, anyway — and to have him 
want to stay in an Earthman's home 
- just puts the maraschino cherry on 
top." 

Rose said, wearily, "This is different. I'm surprised you can't

understand it, Drake. He's a doctor. He's coming here in the way 
of medical research, and I'll grant 
you that he probably doesn't enjoy 
staying with human beings and "will 
find us perfectly horrible. But he 
must stay just the same! Do you 
suppose human doctors enjoy going into the tropics, or that they 
are particularly fond of letting 
themselves be bitten by infected 
mosquitoes ?" 

"Drake said sharply, "What's this 
about mosquitoes? What have they 
to do -with it?" 

"Why, nothing," Rose answered, 
surprised, "It just came to my 
mind, that's all. I was thinking of 
Reed and his yellow fever experiments.''' 

Drake shrugged. "Well, have it 
your own way." 

For a moment, Rose hesitated. 
"You're not angry about this, are 
you?" To her own ears she sounded 
unpleasantly girlish. 

"No." 

And that, Rose knew, meant that 
he was. 

ROSE surveyed herself doubtfully in the full-length mirror. 
She had never been beautiful and was quite reconciled to the 
fact; so much so that it no longer 
mattered. Certainly, it would not 
matter to a being from I lawkin's 
Planet. What did bother her was 
this matter of being a hostess under 
the very queer circumstances of 
having to be tactful to an extra


terrestrial creature and, at the same 
time, to her husband as well. She 
wondered which would prove the 
more difficult. 

Drake was coming home late -that 
day; he was not due for half an 
hour. Rose found herself inclined 
to believe that he had arranged that 
purposely in a sullen desire to leave 
her alone with her problem. She 
found herself in a state of mild 
resentment. 

He had called her just before 
noon at the Institute and had asked 
abruptly, "When are you taking 
him home?" 

She answered, curtly, "In about 
three hours." 

"All right. What's his name? 
His Hawkinsite name?" 

"Why do you want to know?" 
She could not keep the chill from 
her words. 

"Let's call it a small investigation 
of my own. After all, the thing 
will be in my house." 

"Oh, for heaven's sake, Drake, 
don't bring your job home with 
you!" 

Drake's voice sounded tinny and 
nasty in her ears. "Why not, Rose? 
Isn't that exactly what you're doing?" 

It was, of course, so she gave 
him the information he wanted. 

This was the first time in their 
married life that they had had even 
the semblance of a quarrel, and, as 
she sat there before the full-length 
mirror, she began to wonder if perhaps she ought not make an at

tempt to see his side of it. In 
essence, she had married a policeman. Of course he was more than 
simply a policeman; he was a member of the World Security Board. 

It 'had been a surprise to her 
friends. The fact of the marriage 
itself had been the biggest surprise, 
but if she had decided on marriage, 
the attitude was, why not with another biologist? Or, if she had 
wanted to go afield, an anthropologist, perhaps; even a chemist; but 
why, of all people, a policeman ? 
Nobody had exactly said those 
tilings, naturally, but il had been 
in the very atmosphere at the time 
of her marriage. 

She had resented it then, and 
ever since. A man could marry 
whom he chose, but ifa doctor of 
philosophy, female variety, chose to 
marry a man who never went past 
the bachelor's degree, there was 
shock. Why should there be? What 
business was it of theirs? He was 
handsome, in a way, intelligent, in 
another way, and she was perfectly 
satisfied with her choice. 

Yet how much of this same 
snobbishness did she bring home 
with her? Didn't she always have 
the attitude that her own work, 
her biological investigations, were 
important, while his job was merely something to be kept within the 
four walls of his little office in the 
old U. N. buildings on the East 
River? 

She jumped up from her seat 
in agitation and, with a deep breath, 



decided to leave such thoughts behind her. She desperately did not 
want to quarrel with him. And she 
just wasn't going to interfere with 
him. She was committed to accepting the Hawkinsite as guest, but 
otherwise she would let Drake have 
his own way. He was making 
enough of a concession as it was. 

HARG THOLAN was standing 
quietly in the middle of the 
living room when she came down 
the stairs. He was not sitting, 
since he was not anatomically constructed to sit. He stood on two sets 
of limbs placed close together, 
while a third pair entirely different 
in construction we re susp ended 
from a region that would have 
been the upper chest in a human 
being. The skin of his body was 
hard, glistening and ridged, while 
his face bore a distant resemblance 
to something alienly bovine. Yet he 
was not completely repulsive, and 
he wore clothes of a sort over the 
lower portion of his body in order 
to avoid offending the sensibilities 
of his human hosts. 

He said, "Mrs. Smollett, I appreciate your hospitality beyond my 
ability to express it in your language," and he drooped so that his 
forelimbs touched the ground for 
a moment. 

Rose knew this to be a gesture 
signifying gratitude among the beings of Hawkin's Planet. She was 
grateful that he spoke English as 
well as he did. The construction of 



HOSTESS

his mouth, combined with an absence of incisors, gave a whistling 
sound to the sibilants. Aside from 
that, he might have been born on 
Earth for all the accent his speech 
showed. 

She said, "My husband will be 
home soon, and then we will eat." 

"Your husband?" For a moment, 
he said nothing more, and then 
added, "Yes, of course." 

She let it go. If there was one 
source of. infinite confusion among 
the five intelligent races of the 
known Galaxy, it lay in the differences among them with regard to 
their sex life and the social institutions that grew around it. The concept of husband and wife, for 
instance, existed only on Earth. The 
other races could achieve a sort of 
intellectual understanding of what 
it meant, but never an emotional 
one. 

She said, "I have consulted the 
Institute in preparing your menu. 
I trust you will find nothing in it 
that will upset you."
The Hawkinsite blinked its eyes 
rapidly. Rose recalled this- to be a 
gesture of amusement. 

He said, "Proteins are proteins, 
my dear Mrs. Smollett. For those 
trace factors which I need but are 
.not supplied in your food, I have 
brought concentrates that will be 
most adequate," 

And proteins were proteins. Rose 
knew this to be true. Her concern 
for the creature's diet had been 
largely one of formal politeness. 



In the discovery of life on the 
planets of the outer stars, one of 
the most interesting generalizations 
that had developed was the fact 
that, although life could be formed 
on the basis of substances other 
than proteins — even on elements 
other than carbon — it remained true 
that the only known intelligences 
were proteinaceous in nature. This 
meant that each of the five forms 
of intelligent life could maintain 
llicinselves over prolonged periods 
on the food of any of the other 
four. 

SHE heard Drake's key in the 
door and went stiff with apprehension. 

She had to admit he did well. 
He strode in, and, without hesitation, thrust his hand out at the 
Hawkinsite, saying firmly, "Good 
evening, Dr. Tholan." 

The Hawkinsite put out his large 
and rather clumsy forelimb and the 
two, so to speak, shook hands. Rose 
had already gone through that procedure and knew the queer feeling 
of a Hawkinsite hand in her own. 
It had felt rough and hot and dry. 
She imagined that, to the Hawkinsite, her own and Drake's felt 
cold and slimy. 

At the time of the formal greeting, she had taken the opportunity 
to observe the alien hand. It was 
an 'excellent case of converging evolution. Its morphological development was entirely different from 
that of the human hand, yet it had 



92 




 



brought itself into a fairly approximate similarity. There were four 
fingers but no thumb. Each finger 
had five independent jjaU-findsocket joints. In this way, the flexibility lost with the absence of the 
thumb was made up for by the almost tentacular properties of the 
fingers. What was even more interesting to her biologist's eyes was 
the fact that each Hawkinsite finger 
ended in a vestigial hoof, very small 
and, to the layman, unidentifiable 
as such, but clearly adapted at one 
time to running, just as man's had 
been to climbing. 

Drake said, in friendly enough 
fashion, "Are you quite comfortable, sir?" 

The Hawkinsite answered, 
"Quite. Your wife has been most 
thoughtful in all her arrangements." 

"Would you care for a drink?" 

The Hawkinsite did not answer 
but looked at Rose with a slight 
facial contortion that indicated some 
emotion which, unfortunately, Rose 
coidd not interpret. She said, nervously, "On Earth there is the custom of drinking liquids which have 
been fortified with ethyl alcohol. 
We find it stimulating." 

"Oh, yes. I am afraid, then, that 
I must decline. Ethyl alcohol would 
interfere most unpleasantly with my 
metabolism." 

"Why, so it does to Earthmen, 
too, but I understand, Dr. Tholan," 
Drake replied. "Would you object 
to my drinking?" 



"Of course not." 

Drake passed close to Rose on 
his way to the sideboard and she 
caught only one word. He said, 
"God!" in a tightly controlled 
whisper, yet he managed to put 
seventeen exclamation points after 
it. 

THE Hawkinsite stood at the 
table. His lingers were models 
oJ .k-xterity as they wove their way 
around the cutlery. Rose tried not 
to look at him as he ate. His wide 
lipless mouth split his face alarmingly as he ingested food, and, in 
chewing, his large jaws moved disconcertingly from side -to side. It 
was another evidence of his ungulate ancestry. Rose found herself 
wondering if, in the quiet of his 
own room, he would later chew his 
cud, and was then panic-stricken 
lest Drake get the same idea and 
leave the table in disgust. But 
Drake was taking everything quite 
calmly. 

He said, "I imagine, Dr. Tholan, 
that the cylinder at your side holds 
cyanide?" 

Rose started. She had actually 
not noticed it. It was a curved 
metal object, something like a 
water canteen, that fitted flatly 
against the creature's skin, halfhidden behind its clothing. But, 
then, Drake had a policeman's eyes. 

The Hawkinsite was not in the 
least disconcerted. "Quite so," he 
said, and his hoofed fingers held 
out a thin, flexible hose that ran 



HOSTESS 



up his body, its tint blending into 
that of his yellowish skin, and entered the corner of his wide mouth. 
Rose felt slightly embarrassed, as 
though at the display of intimate 
articles of clothing. 

Drake said, "And does it contain pure cyanide?" 

The Hawkinsite humorously 
blinked his eyes. "I hope you are 
not considering possible danger to 
Earrhites. I know the gas is highly 
poisonous to you and I do not need 
a great deal. The gas contained in 
the cylinder is five per cent hydrogen cyanide, the remainder oxygen. 
None of it emerges except when I 
actually suck at the tube, and that 
need not be done frequently." 

"I see. And you really must have 
the gas to live?" 

Rose was slightly appalled. One 
simply did not ask such questions 
without careful preparation. It was 
impossible to foresee where the 
sensitive points of an alien psychology might be. And Drake must 
be doing this deliberately, since he 
could not help realizing that he 
could get answers to such questions 
as easily from herself. Or was it 
that he preferred not to ask her? 

The Hawkinsite remained apparently unperturbed. "Are you not a 
biologist, Mr. Smollett?" 

"No, Dr. Tholan." 

"But you are in close association 
with Mrs. Dr. Smollett." 

Drake smiled a bit. "Yes, I am 
married to a Mrs. doctor, but just 
the same I am not a biologist; mere


ly a minor government official. My 
wife's friends," he added, "call me 
a policeman." 

ROSE bit the inside of her cheek. 
In this case it was the .Hawkinsite who had impinged upon the 
sensitive point of an alien psychology. On Hawkin's Planet, there was 
a tight caste system and intercaste 
associations were limited. But 
Drake wouldn't realize that. 

The Hawkinsite turned to her. 
"May I have your permission, Mrs, 
Smollett, to explain a little of our 
biochemistry to your husband? It 
will be dull for you, since I am 
sure you must understand it quite 
well already." 

She said, "By all means do, Dr. 
Tholan." 

He said, "You sec, Mr. Smollett, 
the respiratory system in your body 
and in the bodies of all air-breathing creatures on Earth is controlled by certain metal-containing 
enzymes, I am taught. The metal is 
usually iron, though sometimes it 
is copper. In either case, small 
traces of cyanide would combine 
with these metals and immobilize 
the respiratory system of the terrestrial living cell. They would be prevented from using oxygen and 

killed in a few minutes. 

"The life on my own planet is 
not quite so constituted. The key 
respiratory compounds contain 
neither iron nor copper; no metal 
at all, in Tact. It is for this reason 
that my blood is colorless. Our 



94 




 



compounds contain certain organic 
groupings which are essential to 
life, and these groupings can only 
be maintained intact in the presence 
of a small concentration of cyanide. 
Undoubtedly, this type of protein 
has developed through millions of 
years of evolution on a world which 
has a few tenths of a per cent of 
hydrogen cyanide occurring naturally in the atmosphere. Its presence 
is maintained by a biological cycle. 
Various of our native micro-organisms liberate the free gas." 

"You make it extremely clear. 
Dr. Tholan, and very interesting," 
Drake said. "What happens if you 
don't breathe it? Do you just go, 
like that?" He snapped his fingers. 

"Not quite. It isn't equivalent to 
the presence of cyanide for you. In 
my case, the absence of cyanide 
would be equivalent to slow strangulation. It happens sometimes, in 
ill-ventilated rooms on my world, 
that the cyanide is gradually consumed and falls below the minimum necessary concentration. The 
results are very painful and difficult to treat." 

Rose had to give Drake credit; 
he really sounded interested. And 
the alien, thank heaven, did not 
mind the catechism. 

The rest of the dinner passed 
wiihout incident. It was almost 
pleasant. 

Throughout the evening, Drake 
remained that way; interested. Even 
more than that — absorbed. He 
drowned her out, and she was glad 



of it. He was the one who was 
really colorful and it was only her 
job, her specialized training, that 
stole the color from him. She 
looked at him gloomily and 
thought, W by did be marry me? 

DRAKE sat, one leg crossed over 
-the other, hands clasped and 
tapping his chin gently, watching 
the Hawkinsite intently. The Hawkinsite faced him, standing in his 
quad ru ped f ash i on . 

Drake said, "I find it difficult to 
keep thinking of you as a doctor." 

The Hawkinsite laughingly 
blinked his eyes. "I understand 
what you mean," he said. "I find 
it difficult to think of you as a 
policeman. On my world, policemen are very specialized and distinctive people." 

"Are they?" said Drake, somewhat drily, and then changed the 
subject. "I gather that you are not 
here on a pleasure trip." 
■ "No, I am here very much on 
business. I intend to study this 
queer planet you call Earth, as it 
has never been studied before by 
any of my people." 

"Queer?" asked Drake. "In 
what way?" 

The Hawkinsite looked at Rose. 
"Does he know of the Inhibition 
Death ?" 

Rose felt embarrassed. "His 
work is important," she said. "I am 
afraid that my husband has little 
time to listen to the details of my 
work." She knew that this was not 



HOSTESS 



95 



really adequate and she felt herself 
to be the recipient, yet again, of 
one of the Hawkinsite' s unreadable 
emotions. 

The extraterrestrial creature 
turned back to Drake "It is always 
amazing to me to find how little 
you Earthmen understand your own 
unusual characteristics. Look, there 
are five intelligent races in the 
Galaxy. These have all developed 
independently, yet have managed 
to converge in remarkable fashion. 
It is as though, in the long run, 
intelligence requires a certain 
physical makeup to flourish. I leave 
that question for philosophers. But 
I need not belabor the point, since 
it must be a familiar one to you. 

/'Now when the differences 
among the intelligences are closely 
investigated, it is found over and 
over again that it is you Earthmen, 
more than .any of the others, who 
are unique. For instance, it is only 
oa Earth that life depends upon 
metal enzymes for respiration. 
Your people are the only ones 
which find hydrogen cyanide poisonous. Yours is the only form of 
intelligent life which is carnivorous. Yours is the only form of life 
which has not developed from a 
grazing animal. And, most interesting of all, yours is the only form 
of intelligent life known which 
stops growing upon reaching maturity." 

Drake grinned at him. Rose felt 
her heart suddenly race. It was 
the nicest thing about him, that 



grin, and he was using it perfectly 
naturally. It wasn't forced or false. 
He was adjusting to the presence 
of this alien creature. He was being pleasant — and he must be doing 
it for heir. She loved that thought 
and repeated it to herself. He was 
doing it for her; he was being nice 
to the Hawkinsite for her sake. 

DRAKE was saying with his grin, 
"You don't look very large, 
Dr. Tholan. I should say that you 
are an inch taller than I am, which 
would make you six feet two inches 
tall. Is it that you are young, or is 
it that the others on your world 
are generally small?" 

"Neither," said the Hawkinsite. 
"We grow at a diminishing rate 
with the years, so that at my age it 
would take fifteen . years to grow 
an additional inch, hut- — and this is 
the important point — we never 
entirely stop. And, of course, as a 
consequence, we never entirely 
die." 

Drake gasped and even Rose felt 
herself sitting stiffly upright. This 
was something new. This was 
something which, to her knowledge, 
the few expeditions to Hawkin's 
Planet had never brought back. She 
was torn with excitement but held 
an exclamation back and let Drake 
speak for her. • 

He said, "They don't entirely 
die? You're not trying to say, sir, 
that the people on Hawkin's Planet 
are immortal?" 

"No people are truly immortal. 




 



If there were no other way to die, 
there would always be accident, and 
if that fails, there is boredom. Few 
of us live more than several centuries of your time. Still, it is unpleasant to think that death may 
come involuntarily. It is something 
which, to us, is extremely horrible. 
It bothers me even as I think of it 
now, this thought that against my 
will and despite all care, death may 
come." 

"We," said Drake, grimly, "are 
quite used to it." 

"You Earthmen live with the 
thought; we do not. And this is 
why we are disturbed to find that 
the incidence of Inhibition Death 
has been increasing in recent years." 

"You have not yet explained," 
said Drake, "just what the Inhibition Death is, but let me guess. Is 
the Inhibition Death a pathological 
cessation of growth?" 

"Exactly." 

"And how long after growth's 
cessation docs death follow?" 

"Within the year. It is a wasting 
disease, a tragic one, and absolutely 
incurable." 

"What causes it?" 

THE Hawkinsite paused a long 
time before answering, and 
even then there was something 
strained and uneasy about the way 
he spoke. "Mr. Smollett, we know 
nothing about the cause of the disease." 

Drake nodded thoughtfully. 
Rose was following the conversa


tion as though she were a spectator 
at a tennis match. 

Drake said, "And why do you 
come to Earth to study this disease?" 

"Because again Earthmen are 
unitjue. They are the only intelligent beings who are immune. The 
Inhibition Death affects all the 
other races. Do your biologists 
know that, Mrs. Smollett?" 

He had addressed her suddenly, 
so that she jumped slightly. She 
said, "No, they don't." 

"I am not surprised. That piece 
of information is the result of very 
recent research. The Inhibition 
Death is easily diagnosed incorrectly and the incidence is much 
lower on the other planets. In fact, 
it is a strange thing, something to 
philosophize over, that the incidence of the Death is highest on 
my world, which is closest to Earth, 
and lower on each more distant 
planet — so that it is lowest on the 
world of the star Tempora, which 
is farthest from Earth, while Earth 
itself is immune. Somewhere in the 
biochemistry of the Earthite, there 
is the secret of that immunity. How 
interesting it would be to find it." 

Drake said, "But look here, you 
can't say Earth is immune. From 
where I sit, it looks as if the incidence is a hundred per cent. All 
Earthmen stop growing and all 
Earthmen die. We've all got the 
Inhibition Death." 

"Not at all. Earthmen live up 
to seventy years after the cessation 



HOSTESS 



97 



of growth. That is not die Death 
as we know it. Your equivalent disease is rather one of unrestrained 
growth. Cancer, you call it. — But 
come, I bore you." 

Rose protested instantly. Drake 
did likewise with even more vehemence, but -the Hawkinsitc determinedly changed the subject. It 
was then that Rose had her first 
pang of suspicion, for Drake circled 
Harg Tholan warily with his words, 
worrying him, jabbing at him, attempting always to get the information back to the point where the 
Hawkinsite had left off. Not baldly, not unskillfully, but Rose knew 
him, and could tell what he was 
after. And what could he be after 
but that which was demanded by 
his profession? And, as though in 
response to her thoughts, the Hawkinsite took up the phrase which 
had begun careening in her mind 
like a broken record on a perpetual 
turntable. 




E ASKED, "Did you not say 
. you were a policeman?" 



Drake said, curtly, "Yes." 

"Then there is something I 
would like to request you to do for 
me. I have been wanting to all this 
evening, since I discovered your 
profession, and yet I hesitate. I do 
not wish to be troublesome to my 
host and hostess." 

"We'll do what we can." 

"I have a profound curiosity as 
to how Earthmen live; a curiosity 
which is not perhaps shared by the 



98 



generality of my countrymen. So I 
wonder, could you show me through 
one of the police departments on 
your planet?" 

' "I do not belong to a police department in exactly the way you 
imagine," said Drake, cautiously. 
"However, I am known to the New 
York police department. I can manage it without trouble Tomorrow?" 

"That would be most convenient 
for me. Would I be able to visit the 
Missing Persons Bureau?" 

"The what?" 

The Hawkinsitc drew his four 
standing legs closer together, as. if 
he were becoming more intense. "It 
is a hobby of mine, a little queer 
corner of interest I have always had. 
I understand you have a group of 
police officers whose sole duty it is 
to search for men who are missing" 

"And women and children," 
added Drake. "But why should 
that interest you so particularly?" 

"Because there again you are 
unique. There is no such thing as 
a missing person on our planet. I 



can't explain the mechanism to you, 
of course, but among the people of 
the other worlds, there is always 
an awareness of one another's presence, especially if there is a strong, 
affectionate tie. We are alwavs 
aware of each other's exact location, 
no matter where on the planet we 
might be." 

Rose grew excited again. The 
scientific expeditions to Hawkin's 
Planet had always had the grcitcst 
difficulty in penetrating the internal 
emotional mechanisms of the natives, and here was one who talked 
freely, who would explain ! She forgot to worry about DraJce and intruded into the conversations. "Can 
you feel such awareness even now? 
On Earth?" 

The Hawkinsite said, "You mean 
across space? No, I'm afraid no*. 
But you see the importance of the 
matter. AH the uniquenesses of 
Earth should be linked. If the lack 
of this sense can be explained, perhaps the immunity to Inhibition 
Death can be, also. Besides, it 
strikes me as very curious (hat .my 



HOSTESS 



S9 



form of intelligent community life 
can be built up among people who 
lack this community awareness. 
How can an Earth-man tell, for instance, when he has formed a congenial sub-group, a family? How 
can you two, for instance, know 
that there is a ' true tie between 
you ?" 

Rose found herself nodding. 
How strongly she missed such a 
sense ! 

But Drake only smiled. "We 
have our ways. It is as difficult to 
explain what we call 'Jove' to you 
as it is for you to explain your sense 
to us." 

"I suppose so. Yet tell me truthfully, Mr. Smollett — if Mrs. Smollett were to leave this room and 
enter another without your having 
seen her do so, would you really 
not be aware ot her location?" 

"I really would not." 

The Hawkinsite said, "Amazing." He hesitated, then added, 
"Please do not be offended .at the 
fact that I find it revolting as well." 

AFTER the light in the bedroom 
had been put out, Rose went 
to the door three times, opening it 
a crack and peering out. She could 
feel Drake- watching her. There was 
a hard kind of amusement in his 
voice as he asked, finally, "What's 
the matter?" 

She said, "I want to talk to you." 
"Are you afraid our friend can 
hear?" 

Rose was whispering. She got 



into bed and put her head on his 
pillow so that she could whisper 
better. She said, "Why were you 
talking about the Inhibition Death 
to Dr. Tholan?" 

"I am taking an interest in your 
work. Rose. You've always wanted 
me to take an interest." 

"I'd rather you weren't sarcastic." 
She was almost violent, as nearly 
violent as she could be in a whisper. "1 know that there's something of your own interest in this — 
of police interest, probably. What 
is it?" 

He said, "1*11 talk to you tomorrow." 

"No, right now." 

He put his hand under her head, 
lifting it. For a wild moment she 
thought he was going to kiss her— 
just kiss her on impulse the way 
husbands sometimes did, or as she 
imagined they sometimes did. 
Drake never did, and die didn't 
now. 

He merely held her close and 
whispered, "Why are you so interested?" 

His hand was almost brutally 
hard upon the nape of her neck, so 
that she stiffened and tried to draw 
back. Her voice was more than a 
whisper now. "Stop it, Drake." 

He said, "I want no questions 
from you and no interference. Yoir 
do your job, and I'll do mine.' 
"The nature of my job is open 
and known." 

"The nature of my job," he retorted, "isn't, by definition. But I'll 



100 




 



tell you this. Our six-legged friend 
is here in this house for some definite reason. You weren't picked as 
biologist in charge for any random 
reason. Do you know that two days 
ago, he'd been inquiring about me 
at the Commission?" 

"You're joking." 

"Don't believe that for a minute. 
There are depths to this that you 
know nothing about. But that's my 
job and I won't discuss it with you 
any further. Do you understand?" 

"No, but I won't question you 
if you don't -want me to." 

"Then go to sleep." 

She lay stiffly on her back and 
the minutes passed, and then the 
quarter-hours. She was trying to fit 
the pieces together. Even with 
what Drake had told her, the curves 
and colors refused to blend. She 
wondered what Drake would say if 
he knew she had a recording of 
that night's conversation! 

One picture remained clear in 
her mind at that moment. It hovered over her mockingly. The 
Hawkinsite, at the end of the long 
evening, had turned to her and said 
gravely, "Good night, Mrs. Smollett. You are a most charming hostess." 

She had desperately wanted to 
giggle at .the time. How could he 
call her a charming hostess ? To 
him, she could only be a horror, a 
monstrosity with too few limbs and 
a too-narrow face. 
• And then, as the Hawkinsite delivered himself of this completely 



meaningless piece of politeness, 
Drake had turned white ! For one 
instant, his eyes had burned with 
something that looked like terror. 

She had never before known 
Drake to show fear of anything, 
and the picture of that instant of 
pure panic remained with her until 
all her thoughts finally sagged into 
the oblivion of sleep. 

IT WAS noon before Rose was 
at her desk the next day. She 
had deliberately waited until Drake 
and the Hawkinsite had left, since 
only then was she able to remove 
the small recorder that had been 
behind Drake's armchair the previous evening. She had had no 
original intention of keeping its 
presence secret from him. It was 
just that he had come home so 
late, and she couldn't say anything 
about it with the Hawkinsite present. Later on, of course, things had 
changed — 

The placing of the recorder had 
been only a routine maneuver. The 
Hawkinsite's statements and intonations needed to be preserved 
for future intensive studies by 
various specialists at the Institute. 
It had been hidden in order to 
avoid the distortions of self-consciousness that the visibility of such 
a device would bring, and now it 
couldn't be shown to the members 
of the Institute at all. It would 
have to serve a different function 
altogether. A rather nasty function. 
She was going to spy on Drake. 



HOSTESS 



She touched the little, box with 
her fingers and wondered, irrelevantly, 'how Drake was going to 
manage, that day. Social intercourse 
between inhabited worlds was, even 
now, not so commonplace that the 
sight of a Hawkinsite on the city 
streets would not succeed in drawing crowds. But Drake would manage, she knew. Drake always 
managed. 

She listened once again to the 
sounds of last evening, repeating 
the interesting moments. She was 
dissatisfied with what Drake had 
told her. Why should the Hawkinsite have been interested in the two 
of them particularly ? Yet Drake 
wouldn't Me. She would have liked 
to check at the Security Commission, but she knew she could not 
do that. Besides, the thought made 
her feel disloyal ; Drake would 
definitely not He. 

But, then again , why should 
Harg Tholan not have investigated 
them? He might have inquired 
similarly about the families of all 
the biologists at the Institute. It 
would be no more than natural to 
attempt to choose the home he 
would find most pleasant by his 
own standards, whatever they were. 

And if he had — even if he had 
investigated only the Smolletts — 
why should that create the great 
change in Drake from intense hostility to intense interest? Drake undoubtedly had knowledge he was 
keeping to himself. Only heaven 
knew how much. 



Her thoughts churned slowly 
through the possibilities of interstellar intrigue. So far, to be sure, 
there were no signs of hostility or 
ill-feeling among any of the five 
intelligent races known to inhabit 
the Galaxy. As yet they were spaced 
at intervals too wide for enmity. 
Even -the barest contact among them 
was all but impossible. Economic 
and political interests just had no 
points at which to conflict. 

T)UT that was only her idea and 
-LI she was not a member of the 
Security Commission. If there' were 
conflict, if there were danger, if 
there were any reason to suspect 
that the mission of a Hawkinsite 
might be other than peaceful — 
Drake would know. 

Yet was Drake sufficiently high 
in the councils of the Security Commission to know, off-hand, the 
dangers involved in the visit of a 
Hawkinsite physician? She had 
never thought of his position as 
more than that of a very minor 
functionary in the Commission; he 
had never presented himself as 
more. And yet — 
Might he be more? 
She shrugged at the thought. It 
was reminiscent of Twentieth Century spy novels and of costume 
dramas of the days when there existed such things as atom bomb 
secrets. 

The thought of costume dramas 
decided her. Unlike Drake, she 
wasn't a real policeman, and she 



GALAXY SCIENCE NCTION 



didn't know how a real policeman 
would go about it. But she knew 
how such things were done in the 
old dramas. 

She drew a piece of paper (toward her and, with a quick motion, 
slashed a vertical pencil mark 
down its center. She headed one 
column "Hirg Tholan," the other 
"Drake." Under " Harg Tholan' ' 
she wrote "bonafide" and thoughtfully put three question marks after 
k. After all, was lie a doctor at all, 
or was he what .could only be described as an interstellar agent? 
What proof had even the Institute 
of his profession except his own 
statements? Was that why Drake 
had quizzed him so relentlessly concerning the Inhibition Death? Had 
he boned up in advance and tried 
to catch the Hawkinsite in an error? 

For a moment, she was irresolute; 
then, springing to her feel., she 
folded the paper, put it in the 
pocket of her short j acket, and 
swept out of her office. She said 
nothing to any of those she passed 
as she left the Institute. She left no 
word at the reception desk as to 
where she was going, or when she 
would be back. 

Once outside, she hurried into 
the third level tube and waited for 
an empty compartment to pass. The 
two minutes that elapsed seemed 
unbearably long. It was all she 
could do to say, "New York 
Academy of Medicine," into the 
mouthpiece just above the seat. 

The door of the little cubicle 



closed, and the sound of the air 
flowing past the compartment hissed 
upward in pitch. 

THE New York Academy of 
Medicine had been enlarged 
both vertically and horizontally in 
the past two decades. The library, 
alone, occupied one entire wing of 
the third floor. Undoubtedly, if all 
the books, pamphlets and periodicals it contained were in their original printed form, rather than in 
microfilm, the entire building, huge 
though it was, would not have been 
sufficiently vast to hold them. As it 
was, Rose knew there was already 
talk of limiting printed works to 
the last five years, rather than to 
the last ten, as was now the case. 

Rose, as a member of the 
Academy, had free entry to the 
library. She hurried toward the 
alcoves devoted to extraterrestrial, 
medicine and was relieved to find 
them unoccupied. 

It might have been wiser to have 
enlisted the aid of a librarian, but 
she chose not to. The thinner and 
smaller the trail she left, the less 
likely it was that Drake might pick 
it up. 

And so, without guidance, she 
was satisfied to travel along the 
shelves, following the titles anxiously with her fingers. The books; 
were almost all in English, though 
some were in German or Russian. 
None, ironically enough, were in 
extra-terrestrial symbolisms. There 
was a room somewhere for such 



HOSTESS 



103 



originals, but they were available 
only to official translators. 

Her traveling eye and finger 
stopped. She had found what she 
was looking for. 

She dragged half a dozen volumes from the shelf and spread 
them out upon the small dark 
table. She fumbled for the light 
switch and opened the first of the 
volumes. It was entitled Studies on 
Inhibition. She leafed through it 
and then turned to the author index. The name of Harg Tholan 
was there. 

One by one, she looked up the 
references indicated, then returned 
to the shelves for translations of 
such original papers as she could 
find. 

She spent more than two hours 
in the Academy. When she was 
finished, she knew this much — 
there was a Hawkinsite doctor 
named Harg Tholan, who was an 
expert on the Inhibition Death. lie 
was connected with the Hawkinsite 
research organization with which 
the Institute had been in correspondence. Of course, the Harg 
Tholan she knew might simply be 
impersonating an actual doctor to 
make the role more realistic, but 
why should that be necessary? 

SHE took the paper out of her 
pock c t and , where she had 
written "bonafide" with three question marks, she now wrote a YES 
in capitals. She went back to the 
Institute and at four P.M. was 



once again at her desk. She called 
the switchboard to say that she 
would not answer any phone calls 
and then she locked her door. 

Underneath the column headed 
"Harg Tholan" she now wrote two 
questions: "Why did Harg Tholan 
come to Earth alone?" She left considerable space. Then, "What is his 
interest in the Missing Persons Bureau?" 

Certainly, the Inhibition Death 
was all the Hawkinsite said it was.. 
From her reading at the Academy, 
it was obvious that it occupied the 
maj or share of med ical effor t on 
Hawkin's Planet. It was more 
feared there than cancer was on 
Earth. If they had thought the 
answer to it lay on Earth, the Hawkinsites would have sent a full-scale 
expedition. Was it distrust and suspicion on their part that made thein 
send only one investigator? 

What was it Harg Tholan had 
said the night before > The incidence of the Death was highest 
upon his own world, which was 
closest to Earth, lowest upon the 
world farthest from Earth. Add to 
that the fact implied by the Hawkinsite, and verified by her own 
readings at the Academy, that the 
incidence had expanded enormously 
since interstellar contact had been 
made with Earth . . . 

Slowly and reluctantly she came 
to one conclusion. The inhabitants 
of Hawkin's Planet might have decided that somehow Earth had discovered the cause of the Inhibition 




 



Death, and was deliberately fostering it among; the alien peoples of 
the Galaxy, with .the intention, perhaps, of becoming supreme among 
the stars. 

She rejected this conclusion with 
what was almost panic. It could not 
be; it was impossible. In the first 
place, Earth wouldn't do such a 
horrible thing. Secondly, it 
couldn't. 

As far as scientific advance was 
concerned, the beings of Hawkin's 
Planet were certainly 'the equals of 
Earthmen. The Death had occurred 
there for thousands of years and 
their medical record was one of 
total failure. Surely, Earth, in its 
long-distance investigations into 
alien biochemistry, could not have 
succeeded so quickly. In fart, as far 
as she knew, there were no investigations to speak of into Hawkinsitc 
pathology on the part of Earth 
biologists and physicians. 

Yet all the evidence indicated 
that Harg Tholan had come in suspicion and had been received in 
suspicion. Carefully, she wrote 
down under the question, "Why did 
Harg Tholan come to Earth 
alone?" the answer, "Hawkin's 
Planet believes Earth is causing the 
Inhibition Death." 

But, then, what was this business about the Bureau of Missing 
Persons ? As a scientist, she was 
rigorous about the theories she developed. All the facts had to fit in, 
not merely isome of them. 

Missing Persons Bureau! If it 



was a false trail, deliberately intended to 'deceive Drake, it had 
been done clumsily, since it came 
only after an hour of discussion of 
the Inh ibit i on D ea th . 

Was it intended as an opportunity to study Drake? If so, why? 
Was this perhaps the major point? 
The Hawkinsite ihad investigated 
Drake hefore coming to them. Had 
he come because Drake was a policeman with entry to Bureaus of 
Missing Persons? 

But why? Why? 

SHE gave it up and turned to 
the column (headed "Drake." 
And there a question wrote itself, not in pen and ink upon the 
paper, but in the much more visible 
letters of thought on mind. Why 
did he marry me? thought Rose, 
and she covered her eyes with her 
hands so that the unfriendly light 
was excluded. 

They had met quite by accident 
somewhat more than a year before, 
when he had moved into the apartment house in which she then lived. 
Polite greetings had somehow become friendly conversation and 
this, in turn, had led to occasional 
dinners in a neighborhood restaurant. It had been very friendly and 
normal and an excitingly new experience, and she had fallen in 
love. 

When he asked her to marry him, 
she was pleased— and overwhelmed. 
At the time, she had many explanations for it. He appreciated 



HOSTESS 



105 



her intelligence and friendliness. 
She was a nice girl. She would 
make a good wife, a splendid companion. 

She had tried all those explanations and had half-believed every 
one of them. But half-belief was 
not enough. 

It was not that she had any definite fault to find in Drake as a 
husband. He was always thoughtful, kind and a gentleman. Their 
married life was not one oi passion, 
and yet it suited the paler emotional surges of the late thirties. 
She wasn't nineteen. What did she 
expect ? 

Th.it was it; she wasn't nineteen. 
She wasn't beautiful, or charming, 
or glamorous. What did she expect? 
Could she have expected Drake — 
handsome and rugged, whose interest in intellectual pursuits was 
quite minor, who neither asked 
about her work in all the months 
of their marriage, nor offered to 
discuss his own with her ? Why, 
then, did 'he marry 'her? 

But there was no answer to that 
question, and it had nothing to do 
with what Rose was trying to do 
now. It was extraneous, she told 
herself fiercely; it was a childish 
distraction f rom the task she had 
set herself. She was acting like a 
girl of nineteen, after all, with no 
chronological excuse for it. 

She found that the point of her 
pencil had somehow broken, and 
took a new one. In the column 
headed "Drake" she wrote, "Why 



is he suspicious of Harg Tholan?" 
and xmder it she put an arrow 
pointing to the other column. 

What she had already written 
there was sufficient explanation. If 
Earth were spreading the Inhibition Death, or if Earth knew it was 
suspected of such a deed, then, 
obviously, it would be preparing 
for eventual retaliation on the part 
of the aliens. In fact, the setting 
would actually be one of preliminary maneuvering for the first interstellar war of history. It was an 
adequate but horrible explanation. 

Now there was left the second 
question, the one she could not 
answer. She wrote it slowly, "Why 
Drake's reaction to Tholan's words, 
' Yo u are a most charming host* 
ess.*?" 

SHE tried to bring back the exact setting. The Hawkins ite had 
said it innocuously, matter oi -factly, politely, and Drake had frozen 
at the sound of it. Over and over, 
she had listened to that particular 
passage in the recording. An Earthman might have said it in just such 
an inconsequential tone on leaving 
a routine cocktail party. The recording did not carry the sight of 
Drake's face; she had only her 
memory for that. Drake's eyes hud 
become alive with fear and hate, 
and Drake was one who feared 
practically nothing. What was theie 
to fear in the phrase, "You arc a 
most charming hostess," that could 
upset him so? Jealousy? Absurd. 



l 06 




 



The feeling that Tholan had been 
sarcastic? Maybe, though unlikely. 
She was sure Tholan was sincere. 

She gave it up and put a large 
question mark under that second 
question. There were two of them 
now, one under "Harg Tholan' * 
and one under "Dr:ike." Could 
there be a connection between 
Tholan's interest in missing persons and Drake's reaction to a polite party phrase? She could think 
of none. 

She put her head down upon her 
arms. It was getting dark in the 
office and she was very tired. For 
a while, she must have hovered in' 
that queer land between waking 
and sleeping, when thoughts and 
phrases lose the control of the conscious and disport themselves erratically and surrealistically through 
one's head. But, no matter where 
they danced and leaped, they always returned to that one phrase, 
"You are a most charming hostess." 
Sometimes she heard it in Harg 
Tholan's cultured, lifeless voice, 
and sometimes in Drake's vibrant 
one. When Drake said it, it was 
full of love, full of a love she 
never heard from him. She liked 
to hear him say it. 

She startled herself to wakefulness. It was quite dark in the office 
now, and she put on the desk light. 
She blinked, then frowned a little. 
Another thought must have come 
to her in that fitful half-sleep. There 
had been another phrase which had 
upset Drake. What was it? Her 



forehead furrowed with mental 
effort. It had not been last evening. 
It was not anything in the recorded 
conversation, so it must have been 
before that. Nothing came and she 
grew restless. 

Looking at her watch, she gasped. 
It was almost eight. They would 
be at home waiting for her. 

But she did not want to go home. 
She did not want to face them. 
Slowly, she took up the paper upon 
which she had scrawled her 
thoughts of the afternoon, tore it 
into little pieces and let them flutter into the little atomic-flash ashtray upon her desk. They were gone 
in a little flare and nothing was left 
of them. 

If only nothing were left of the 
thoughts they represented as well. 

It was no use. She would have 
to go home. 

TI 1EY were not there waiting 
for her, after all. She came 
upon them getting out of a gyrocab just as she emerged from the 
tubes on to street level. The gyroCabbie, wide-eyed, gazed after his 
fares for a moment, then hovered 
upward and away. By unspoken 
mutual consent, the three waited 
until they had entered the apartment before speaking. 

Rose said disinterestedly, "I hope 
you have had a pleasant day. Dr. 
Tholan." 

"Quite. And a fascinating and 
profitable one as well, I think." 
"Have you had a chance to eat?" 



HOSTESS 



107 



though Rose had not herself eaten, 
she was anything but hungry. 
"Yes, indeed." 

Drake interrupted, "We had 
lunch and supper sent up to us. 
Sandwiches." He sounded tired. 

Rose said, "Hello, Drake." It 
was the first time she had addressed 
him. 

Drake scarcely looked at her. 
"Hello.'' 

The H.iwkinsilc said, "Your tomatoes are remarkable vegetables. 
We have nothing to compare with 
them in taste on our own planet. I 
believe I ate two dozen, as well as 
an entire bottle of tomato derivative." 

"Ketchup," explained Drake, 
briefly. 

Rose said, "And your visit at the 
Missing Persons Bureau, Dr. Tholan ? You say you found it profitable?" 

"I should say so. Yes." 

Rose kept her back to him. She 
plumped up sofa cushions as she 
said, "In what way?" 

"I find it most interesting that 
the large majority of missing persons are males. Wives frequently 
report missing husbands, while the 
reverse is practically never the 
case." 

Rose said, "Oh, that's not mysterious, Dr. Tholan. You simply 
don't realize the economic setup we 
have on Earth. On this planet, you 
see, it is the male who is usually 
the member of the family that 
maintains it as an economic unit. 



He is the one whose labor is repaid 
in units of cUf rency . The wi f e ' s 
function is generally that of taking 
care of home and children." 

"Surely this is not universal!" 

Drake put in, "More or less. If 
you are thinking of 111)' wife, she 
is an example of the minority of 
women who are capable of making 
their own way in the world." 

Rose looked at him swiftly. Was 
he being sarcastic? 

THE Hawkinsite said, "Your implication, Mrs. Smollett, is that 
women, being economically dependent upon their male companions, 
find it less feasible to disappear?" 

"That's a gentle way of putting 
it," said Rose, "but that's about 
it." 

"And would you call the Missing Persons Bureau of New York 
a fair sampling of such cases in the 
planet at large?" 

"Why, I should think so." 

The Hawkinsite said, abruptly, 
"And is there, then, an economic 
explanation for the fact that since 
interstellar travel has been developed, the percentage of young 
males among the missing is more 
pronounced than ever?" 

It was Drake who answered, 
with a verbal snap. "Good lord, 
that's even less of a mystery than 
the other. Nowadays, 'the runaway 
has all space to disappear into. Anyone who wants to get away from 
trouble need only hop the nearest 
space freighter. They're always 



105 




 



looking for crewmen, no questions 
asked, and it would be almost impossible to locate the runaway after 
that, if he really wanted to stay out 
of circulation." 

"And almost always young men 
in their first year of marriage." 

Rose laughed suddenly. She said, 
"Why, that's just the time a man's 
troubles seem the greatest. If lie 
survives the first year, .there is usually no need to disappear at all." 

Drake was obviously not amused. 
Rose thought again that he looked 
tired and unhappy. Why did he insist on bearing the load alone ? 
And then she thought that perhaps die had to. 

The Hawkinsite said, suddenly, 
"Would it offend you if I disconnected for a period of time?" 

Rose said, "Not at all. I hope 
you haven't had too exhausting a 
day. Since you come from a planet 
whose gravity is greater than that 
of Earth's, I'm afraid we too easily 
presume that you would show 
greater endurance than we do." 

"Oh, I am not tired in a physical 
sense." He looked for a moment at 
her legs and blinked very rapidly, 
indicating amusement. "You know, 
I keep expecting Earthmen to fall 
either forward or backward in view 
of their meager equipment of 
standing limbs. You .must pardon 
me if my comment is overfarniliar, 
but your mention of the leaser 
gravity of Earth brought it to my 
mind. On my planet, two legs 
would simply not be enough. But 

HOSTESS 



this is all beside the point at the 
moment. It is just that I have been 
absorbing so many new and unusual concepts that I feel the desire 
for a little disconnection." 

Rose shrugged inwardly. Well, 
that was as close as one race could 
get to another, anyway. As nearly 
as the expeditions to Hawkin's 
Planet could make out, Hawkinsites had the faculty for disconnecting their conscious mind from 
all its bodily functions and allowing it to sink into an undisturbed 
meditative process for periods of 
time lasting up to terrestrial days. 
Hawkinsites found the process 
pleasant, even necessary sometimes, 
though no Earthman could truly 
say what function it served. 

Conversely, it had never been 
entirely possible for Earthmen to 
explain the concept of "sleep" to 
a Hawkinsite, or to any extraterrestrial. What an Earthman would 
call sleep or a dream, a Hawkinsite 
would view as an alarming sign of 
mental disintegration. Rose thought 
uneasily, Here is another way Earthmen are unique. 

The Hawkinsite was backing 
away, drooping so that his forelimbs swept the floor in polite farewell. Drake nodded curtly at him 
as he disappeared behind the bend 
in the corridor. They heard his 
door open, close, then silence. 

AFTER minutes in which the 
silence was thick between 
them, Drake's chair creaked as he 

109 



shifted restlessly. With a mild 
horror, Rose noticed blood upon 
his lips. She thought to herself, 
He's in some kind of trouble. I've 
got to talk to him. I can't let it go 
on like this. 

She said, "Drake!" 

Drake seemed to look at her 
from a far, far distance. Slowly, his 
eyes focused closer at hand and he 
said, "What is it? Are you through 
for the day, itoo?" 

"No, I'm ready to begin. It's the 
tomorrow you spoke of. Aren't you 
going to speak to me?" 

"Pardon me?" 

"Last night, you said you would 
speak to me tomorrow. I am ready 
now." 

DRAKE frowned. His eyes withdrew beneath a lowered brow 
and Rose felt some of her resolution begin to leave her. He said, "I 
thought it was agreed that you 
would not question me about my 
business in this matter." 

"I think it's too late for that. I 
know too much about your business 
by now." 

"What do you mean ?" he 
shouted, jumping to his feet. Recollecting himself, he approached, 
laid, his hands upon her shoulders 
and repeated in a lower voice, 
"What do you mean?" 

Rose kept her eyes upon her 
hands, which rested limply in her 
lap. She bore the painfully gripping 
fingers patiently, and said slowly, 
"Dr. Tholan thinks that Earth is 



spreading the Inhibition Death 
purposely. That's it, isn't it?" 

She waited. Slowly, the grip relaxed and he was standing there, 
hands at his side, face baffled and 
unhappy. He said, "Where did you 
get that notion ?" 
"It's true, isn't it?" 
He said breathlessly, unnaturally, 
"I want to know exactly why you 
say that. Don't play foolish games 
with me, Rose. This is for keeps." 

"If I tell you, will you answer 
one question ?" 

"What question?" 
"Is Earth spreading the disease 
deliberately, Drake?" 

Drake flung his hands upward. 
"Oh, for Heaven's sake!" 

He knelt before her. He took 
both her hands in his and she could 
feel their trembling. He was forcing his voice into soothing, loving 
syllables. 

He was saying, "Rose dear, look, 
you've got something red-hot by 
the tail and you think you can use 
it to tease me in a little husbandwife repartee. Now, I'm not asking 
much. Just tell one exactly what 
causes you to say what- — what you 
have just said." He was terribly 
earnest about it. 

"I was at the New York 
Academy of Medicine this afternoon. I did some reading there." 

"But why? What made you do 
it?" 

"You seemed so interested in the 
Inhibition Death, for one thing. 
And Dr. Tholan made those state


no 




 



merits about the incidence increasing since interstellar travel, and 
being the highest on the plan et 
nearest Earth." She paused. 

"And your reading?" he prompted. "What about your reading, 
Rose?" 

SHE said, "It backs him up. All 
I could do was to skim hastily 
into the direction of their research 
in recent decades. It seems obvious 
to me, though, that at least some 
of the Hawkinsites are considering 
the possibility the Inhibition Death 
originates on Earth." 

"Do they say so outright?" 
"No. Or, if they have, I haven't 
seen it." She gazed at him in surprise. In a matter like this, certainly 
the government would have investigated Hawkinsite research on 
the matter. She said, gently, "Don't 
you know about Hawkinsite research in the matter, Drake? The 
government — " 

"Never mind about that." Drake 
had moved away from her and now 
he turned again. His eyes were 
bright. He said, as though making 
a wonderful discovery, "Why, 
you're an expert in this!" 

Was she? Did he find that out 
only now that he needed her? Her 
nostrils flared and she said flatly, 
"I am a biologist." 

He said, "Yes, I know that, but 
I mean your particular specialty is 
growth. Didn't you once tell me 
you had done work on growth?" 
"You might call it that. I've had 



twenty papers published on the relationship of nucleic acid 'fine 
structure' and embryonic development on my Cancer Society grant." 

"Good. I should have thought 
of that." He was choked with a 
new excitement. "Tell me, RoseLook, I'm sorry if I lost my temper 
with you a moment ago. You'd be 
as competent as anyone to understand the direction of their researches if you read about it, 
wouldn't you?" 

"Fairly competent, yes." 

"Then tell me how they think 
the disease is spread. The details, 
I mean." 

"Oh, now look, that's asking a 
little too much. I spent a few hours 
in the Academy, that's all. I'd need 
much more time tihan that to be 
able to answer your question." 

"An intelligent guess, at least. 
You can't imagine how important 
it is." 

She said, doubtfully, "Of course, 
"Studies on Inhibition' is a major 
treatise in the field. It would summarize all of the available research 
data." 

"Yes? And how recent is it?" 

"It's one of those periodic things. 
The last volume is about a year 
old." 

"Does it have any account of bis 
work in it?" His ringer jabbed in 
the direction of Harg Tholan's bedroom. 

"More than anyone else's. He's 
an outstanding worker in the field. 
I looked over his papers especially." 



HOSTESS 



111 



She ran after him. "What are 
you going to do?" 

"Ask him a few questions." He 
was rummaging through the drawers of 'his desk and now his right 
hand withdrew. It held a needlegun. 

She cried, "No, Drake!" 

He shook her off roughly, and 
turned down the corridor toward 
the Hawkinsite's bedroom. 

DRAKE threw the dopr open 
and entered. Rose was at his 
heels, still trying to grasp his arm, 
but now she stopped and looked 
at Harg Tholan. 

The Hawkinsite was Standing 
there motionless, eyes unfocused, 
his four standing limbs sprawled 
out in four directions as far as they 
would go. Rose felt ashamed of 
intruding, as though she were violating an intimate rite. But Drake, 
apparently unconcerned, walked to 
within four feet of the creature and 
stood there. They were face to face, 
Drake holding the needle-gun easily 
at a level of about the center of the 
Hawkinsite's torso. 

Drake said, "Now keep quiet. 
He'll gradually become aware of 
me." 

"How do you know?" 

The answer was flat. "I know. 
Now get out of here." 

But she did not move and Drake 
was too absorbed to pay her further 
attention. 

Portions of the skin on the 
Hawkinsite's face were beginning 



to quiver slightly. It was rahher repulsive and Rose found herself preferring not to watch. 

Drake said suddenly, "That's 
about all. Dr. Tholan. Don't throw 
in connection with any of the limbs. 
Your sense organs and voice box 
will be quite enough." 

The Hawkinsite's voice was dim. 
"Why do you invade my dtsconn ection chamber ? ' ' Then, more 
strongly, "And why are you 
armed ?" 

His head wobbled slightly atop 
a still frozen torso. He had, apparently, followed Drake's suggestion 
against limb connection. Rose wondered how Drake knew suah partial 
reconnection to be possible. She 
herself had not known of it. 

The Hawkinsite spoke again. 
"What do you want?" 

And this time Drake answered. 
He said, "The answer to certain 
questions." 

"With a gun in your hand? I 
would not humor your discourtesy 
so far." 

"You would not merely be humoring me. You might be saving 
your own life." 

"That would be a matter of considerable indifference to me, under 
itrhe circumstances. I am sorry, MrSmollett, that the duties toward a 
guest are so badly understood on 
Earth." 

"You are no guest of mine, Dr. 
Tholan," said Drake. "You entered 
my house on false pretenses. You 
had some reason for it, some way 



, HOSTESS 



113 



you had planned of ' using me to 
further your own purposes. I have 
no compunction in reversing the 
process." 

"You had better shoot. It will 
save time." 

"You are -convinced that you will 
answer no questions? That, in itself, Is suspicious. It seems that 
you consider certain answers to be 
more important than your life." 

"I consdier the principles of 
courtesy to be very important. You, 
as an Earthman, may not understand." 

"Perhaps not. But I, as an Earthman, understand one thing." Drake 
had jumped forward, faster than 
Rose could cry out, faster than the 
Hawkinsite could connect his 
limbs. When he sprang backward, 
the flexible hose of Harg Tholan's 
cyanide cylinder was in his hand. 
At the corner of the Hawkinsite's 
wide mouth, where the hose had 
once been affixed, a droplet of 
colorless liquid oozed sluggishly 
from a break in the rough skin, and 
slowly solidified into a brown 
jellylike globule, as it oxidized. 

DRAKE yanked at the hose and 
the cylinder jerked free. He 
plunged home the knob that controlled the needle valve at the head 
of the cylinder and the small hissing ceased. 

"I doubt," said Drake, "that 
enough will have escaped to endanger us. I lhope, however, that 
you realize what will happen to 



you now, if you do not answer the 
questions I am going to ask you — 
and answer them in such a way 
that I am convinced you are being 
truthful." 

"Give me back my cylinder," said 
the Hawkinsite, slowly. "If not, it 
will be necessary for me to attack 
you and then it will be necessary 
for you to kill me." 

Drake stepped back. "Not at all. 
Attack me and I shoot your legs 
from under you. You will lose 
them; all four, if necessary, but 

you will still live, In a horrible 
way. You will live to die of cyanide 
lack. It would be a most uncomfortable death. I am only an Earthman and I can't appreciate its true 
horrors, but you can, can't you?" 

The Hawkinsite's mouth was 
open and something within quivered yellow-green. Rose wanted to 
throw up. She wanted to scream, 
Give him back the cylinder, Drake! 
But nothing would come. She 
couldn't even turn her head. 

Drake said, "You have about an 
hour, I .think, before the effects are 
irreversible. Talk quickly, Dr. Tholan, and you will, have your cylinder back." 

"And after that — " said the 
Hawkinsite. 

"After that, what does it matter 
to you ? Even if I kill you then, it 
will be a clean death; not cyanide 
lack." 

Something seemed to pass out of 
the Hawkinsite. His voice grew guttural and his words blurred as 




 



though he no longer 'had the energy 
to keep his English perfect. He 
said, "What are your questions?" 
and as he spoke, his eyes followed 
the cylinder in Drake's hand. 

Drake swung it deliberately, tantalizingly, and the creature's eyes 
followed— followed — 

Drake said, "What are your 
theories concerning the Inhibition 
Death ? Why did you really come 
to Earth? What is your interest in 
the Missing Persons Bureau?" 

Rose found 'herself waiting in 
breathless anxiety. These were the 
questions she would like to have 
asked, too. Not in this manner, perhaps, but in Drake's job, kindness 
and humanity had to take second 
place to necessity. 

She repeated that to herself several times in an effort to counteract 
the fact that she found herself 
loathing Drake for what he was 
doing to Dr. Tholan. 

rpHE Hawkinsitc said, "The 
proper answer would take more 
than the hour I have left me. You 
have bitterly shamed me by forcing 
me to talk under duress. On my 
own planet, you could not have 
done so under any circumstances. It 
is only here, on this revolting 
planet, that I can be deprived of 
cyanide." 

"You are wasting your hour, Dr. 
Tholan." 

"1 would have told you this eventually, Mr. Smollett. I needed your 
'help. It is why I came here." 



"You are still not answering my 
questions." 

"I will answer them now. For 
years, in addition to my regular 
scientific work, I have been privately investigating the cells of my 
patients suffering from Inhibition 
Death. I have been forced to use 
the utmost secrecy and to work 
without assistance, since the methods I used to investigate the bodies 
of my patients were frowned upon 
by my people. Your society would 
have similar feelings against human vivisection, for instance. For 
this reason, I could not present the 
results I obtained to my fellow 
physicians until I had verified my 
theories here on Earth." 

"What were your theories?" demanded Drake. The feverishness. 
had returned to his eyes. 

"It became more and more obvious to me as I proceeded with my 
studies that the entire direction of 
research into the Inhibition Death 
was wrong. The answer was neither 
bacterial nor viral." 

Rose interrupted, "Surely, Dr. 
Tholan, it isn't psychosomatic." 

A thin, gray, translucent film 
had passed over the Hawkinsite's 
eyes. He no' longer looked at them. 
He said, "No, Mrs. Smollett, it is 
not psychosomatic. It is a true infection, but more subtle than could 
be expected of either bacteria or 
viruses. I worked with Inhibition 
Death patients of other races than 
my own, and the conclusion was 
eventually forced upon mc. There 



HOSTESS 



115 



is a whole variety of infection never 
yet suspected by the medical science 
of any of the planets." 

Rose said, faintly, "This is wild, 
impossible. You must be mistaken, 
Dr. Tholan." 

"I am not mistaken. Until I 
came to Earth, I thought I might 
be. But my stay at the Institute, 
my researches at the Missing- Persons Bureau have convinced me 
that this is not so. What is so impossible about the concept of a 
supremely subtle, yet unsuspected 
class of infections? The very 
subtlety would militate against their 
discovery. In your history -and in 
ours, there were thousands of years 
in which the causes of bacterial infections were unknown. And when 
tools were developed capable of 
studying bacteria, viruses remained 
unknown for generations. 

"Is it impossible to proceed a 
step further? Bacteria, by and large, 
are extracellular creatures. They 
compete with the cells of the body 
for foodstuffs, -sometimes too successfully, and they release their 
waste products, or toxins, into the 
bloodstream. The virus goes a step 
further. It lives within the cell, 
utilizing cellular machinery fox its 
own purposes. You know all this, 
Mrs. Smollett, so I need not elaborate. Perhaps your husband knows 
it as well." 




O ON," said Drake. 

"Proceed one more stage, 



then. Imagine a parasite 'that lives 
116 



not only inside the cell, but inside 
the chromosomes of the cell. In 
other words, a parasite that takes 
its place along with the genes, so 
that it is something we might call 
a pseudo-gene. It would ihavc a 
hand in the manufacture of 
enzymes, which is the primary function of genes, and in that way a 
very firm finger in the biochemistry 
of the terrestrial organism." 

Rose said, "Why particularly the 
terrestrial ?" 

"Have you not surmised that the 
pseudo-gene I speak of is a native 
of Earth. Terrestrial beings from 
the beginning have lived with it, 
have adapted to it, are unconscious 
of it. These pseudo-genes feed on 
the organization of the body. Bacterid Iced on the foodstuffs, viruses 
on the cells, pseudo-genes on the 
economy of 'the cellular macrostructure as a whole through their 
control of the body's biochemistry. 
It is why the higher species of 'terrestrial animals, including man, do 
not grow after maturity, and, eventually, die what is called natural 
death. It is the inevitable end result 
of this universal paxastic infestation." 

"A disease of the soul — " Rose 
said, wistfully. 

The Hawkinsite said, "What is 
the soul?" 

"For heaven's sake," said Drake, 
abruptly, "do not get mystical, 
Rose !" 

She flushed. "I'm sorry. Go on, 
Dr. Tholan." 


 



"As a pseudo-gene, it is perfectly obvious how the universal disease 
is transmitted. It is placed along 
with the true genes in every ovum 
or spermatazoon formed by the infected organism. Every organism is 
already infected at the moment of 
conception. But there is another 
form of transmission — there must 
be to account for all the facts. 
Chemically, genes and viruses are 
similar, since both are nuclear proteins. A pseudo-gene can, therefore, exist independently of the 
chromosomes. 

'•'Perhaps it infects a virus, or 
perhaps it forms a viruslike body 
itself at some stage of its development. As such, it can be transmitted in the ordinary fashion of other 
viral infections — by contact, by air, 
through waste materials and so on. 
Naturally, Earthmcn have nothing 
to fear from such contact; they arcalready infected. On Earth, such a 
process is purely vestigial, dating 
back -to the days when infections 
could yet be made. U is different 
on the extraterrestrial worlds, however." 

"I see," said Rose. 

"/ don't," objected Drake, 
bluntly. 

THE Hawkinsite sighed. "We of 
the other worlds have not lived 
with these parasites for millions of 
years, as man and his ancestors had. 
We have not adapted ourselves to 
it. Our weak strains have not been 
killed off gradually through hun


dreds of generations until only the 
resistants were left. So, where 
Earthmen could survive the infection decades with little harm, wc 
others, once dnfected by Che viral 
stage of the disease, die a quick 
death within a year." 

Rose said, "And is ■that why the 
incidence has increased since interstellar travel between Earth and the 
other planets began ?" 

"Yes. There were infections previously. It has long been suspected 
that bacteri al spores an d vi rus 
molecules can drift off into space 
and through it. Absolute zero will 
not kill them, but rather keep them 
alive in definitely. Statistically, a 
certain percentage of them will 
reach other planets. Before space 
travel there were cases which could 
be accounted for, perhaps, by such 
a mechanism. Since then, it has increased ten thousand times and 
more." 

For a moment there was silence, 
and then the Hawkinsite said with 
a sudden access of energy, "Give 
me back my cylinder. You have your 
answer." 

Drake said, coolly, "What about 
the Missing Persons Bureau?" He 
was swinging the cylinder again ; 
but now the Hawkinsite did not 
f ollow its movements. The gray 
translucent film on his eyes had 
deepened and Rose wondered 
whether that was simply an expression of weariness or an example of 
the changes induced by cyanide 
lack. 



HOSTESS 



117 



The Hawtrosite said, "As we are 
not well adapted to the pseudogen.es that infest man, neither arc 
they well adapted to us. It can live 
on us, but it cannot reproduce with 
ourselves alone as the source of its 
life. Infections of Inhibition Death 
before the advent of space travel 
set off tiny epidemics that would 
last through ten or twenty transfers, 
growing gradually milder, until it 
died out altogether. Now, the disease transfers indefinitely, getting 
milder where thorough quarantines 
are imposed and then, suddenly 
and erratically, growing completely 
virulent again." 

Rose looked at him with a growing horror. "What are you implying. Dr. Tholan?" 

He said, "The Earthman remains 
the prime host for the parasite. An 
Earthman may infect one of us if 
he remains among us. But the 
pseudo-gene, once located within 
our cells, cannot maintain its vigor 
indefinitely. Sooner or later, within 
twenty infections, perhaps, it must 
somehow return to an Earthman, if 
it expects to continue reproduction. 
Before interstellar travel this was 
possible only by returning through 
space, which was so unlikely as to 
be considered zero. Now — " 




OSE said faintly, "The missing 
| persons." 



"Yes. They are the intermediate 
hosts. Almost all the young men 
who disappeared in the lost decade 
were space-travelers. They had been 



on other inhabited planets at least 
once in their lives. Once the period 
of incubation within the human 
being has transpired, they return 
to an outer planet. He disappears, 
as far as Earth is concerned." 

"But this is impossible," insisted 
Rose. "What you say implies that 
the pseudo-gene can control the actions of its host! This cannot be!" 

"Why not? They control the biochemistry, at least in part, by their 
very role as pseudo-genes. There is 
no intelligence, or even instinct, 
behind their control. It is purely 
chemical. If adrenalin is injected 
into your bloodstream, there is no 
imposition of a superior intelligence 
that makes your heart double As 
rate, your breathing quicken, your 
clotting time decrease, your blood 
vessels dilate — purely chemical. ' 

" — But I am quite ill now and 
cannot speak much longer. I have 
only this to say. In this pseudo-gene, 
your people and mind have a common enemy. Earthmen, too, need 
not die involuntarily. I thought that 
perhaps if I found myself unable to 
return to my own world with my 
information, due to my own infection, perhaps, I might bring it to 
the authorities on Earth, and ask 
their help in stamping out this 
menace. Imagine my pleasure when 
I found that the husband of one of 
the biologists at the Institute was 
a member of one of Earth's most 
important investigating bodies. Naturally, I did what I could to be a 
guest at his home in order that I 



lis 




 



might deal with him privately; convince him of the terri ble truth ; 
utilize his position to help in the 
attack on the parasites. 

"This is, of course, now impossible. I cannot blame you too 
far. As Earthmen, you cannot be 
expected <to understand thoroughly 
the psychology of my people. 
Nevertheless, you must understand 
this. I can have no further dealing 
with either of you. I could not even 
bear to remain any longer on 
Earth." 

Drake said, "Then you, alone, of 
all your people have any knowledge of this theory of yours." 

"I alone." 

D rale e h eld out the c yl ind er. 
"Your cyanide, Dr. Tholan." 

The Hawkinsite groped for it 
eagerly. His supple fingers manipulated the hose and the needle valve 
with the utmost delicacy. In the 
space of ten seconds, he had it in 
place and was inhaling the gas in 
huge breaths. His eyes were growing clear and transparent. 

DRAKE waited until the Hawkinsite breathings had subsided to normal, and then, without 
expression, he raised his needlegun and fired. 

Rose screamed. The Hawkinsite 
remained standing. His four lower 
limbs were incapable of buckling, 
but his head lolled and, from his 
suddenly flaccid mouth, the cyanide 
hose fell, disregarded. 

Once again, Drake closed the 



needle valve and now he tossed the 
cylinder aside and stood there somberly, looking at the dead creature. 

There was no external mark to 
show that Tholan had been killed. 
The needle-gun's pellet, thinner 
than the needle which gave the 
gun its name, entered the body 
noiselessly and easily, and exploded 
with devastating effect only within 
the abdominal cavity. 

Rose ran from the room, still 
screaming. 

Drake pursued her, seized her 
arm. She heard the hard, brisk 
sounds of his palms upon her face 
without feeling them and subsided 
into little bubbling sobs. 

Drake said, "I told you to have 
nothing to do with this. Now, 
what do you think you're going to 
do?" 

She said, "Let me go. I want to 
leave. I want to go away." 

"Because of something it was my 
job to do? You heard what the 
creature was saying. Do you suppose 
I could allow him to return to his 
world and spread those lies? They 
would believe him. And what do 
you think would happen then? Can 
you guess what an interstellar war 
might be like? They would imagine 
they would have to kill us all to 
stop the disease." 

With an effort that seemed to 
turn her inside out, Rose steadied. 
She looked firmly into Drake's eyes 
and said, "What Dr. Tholan said 
were no lies and no mistakes, 
Drake." 



HOSTESS, 



"Oh, come now, you're hysterical. You need sleep." 

"No, Drake. I know what he said 
is so because the Security Commission knows all about that same 
theory, and knows it to be true." 

"Why do you say such a preposterous thing?" 

"Because you let that slip yourself twice." 

Drake said, "Sit down." 

She did so, and he stood there, 
looking curiously at her. 

He said, "So I have given myself away twice, have I? You've 
had a busy day of detection, my 
dear. You have facets you keep 
well hidden." He sat down and 
crossed his legs. 

ROSE thought, Yes, I've had a 
busy day. She could sec the 
electric clock on the kitchen wall 
from where she sat and it was 
more than .two hours past midnight. 
Harg Tholan had entered their 
house thirty-five hours before; and 
now he lay murdered in the spare 
bedroom. 

Drake said, "Well, aren't you 
going to tell me where T pulled my 
two boners?" . 

"You turned .white when Harg 
Tholan referred to -me as a charming hostess. Hostess has a double 
meaning, you know, Drake. A host 
is one who harbors a parasite." 

"Number one," said Drake. 
"What's number two?" 

"That's something you did before Harg Tholan entered the 



house. I've been trying to remember it for hours. Do you remember, 
Drake? You spoke about how unpleasant it was for Hawkinsites to 
associate with Earthmcn, and I said 
Harg Tholan was a doctor and had 
to. I asked you if you thought that 
human doctors particularly enjoyed 
going to the tropics, or letting infected mosquitoes bite them. Do 
you remember how upset you became?" 

Drake laughed shortly. "I had 
no idea I was so transparent. Mosquitoes are hosts for -the malaria 
and yellow fever parasites." He 
sighed. "I've done my best to keep 
you out of this, Rose. I tried to 
keep the Hawkinsite away. I tried 
threatening you. Now, there's nothing left but to tell you the truth. I 
■must, because only the truth — or 
death — will keep you quiet. And I 
don't want to kill you." 

Rose shrank back in her chair, 
eyes wide. 

Drake said, "The Commission 
knows the truth, yes. It does us 
no good. We can only do all in our 
power to prevent the other worlds 
from finding out." 

"But that is impossible ! The 
truth can't be held down forever. 
Harg Tholan found out. You've 
killed him, but another extraterrestrial will repeat the same discovery 
— over and over again. You can't 
kill them all." 

"We know that, too," agreed 
Drake. "But we have no choice." 

"Why?" cried Rose. "Harg Tho

Ian gave you the solution. He made 
no suggestions or threats regarding 
enmity and war between worlds. 
He said something, instead, for 
which I admired him. He suggested 
that we combine with the other intelligences and help to wipe out the 
parasite. And we can — we can! If 
we, in common with all the others, 
put every scrap of effort into it — " 

"You mean we can trust him? 
Does he speak for his government? Or for the other races?" 

"Can we dare to refuse the 
risk?" 

Drake said, "No, Rose, you don't 
understand." He reached toward 
her and took one of her cold, unresisting Jhands between both of 
his. He went on, "I may seem silly 
trying to teach you anything about 
your specialty, but I want you to 
hear me out. Harg Tholan was 
right. Man and his prehistoric ancestors have been living with this 
pseudo-gene for uncounted ages; 
certainly for a much longer period 
than we have been truly Homo 
sapiens. In that interval, we have 
not only become adapted to it, we 
have become dependent upon it. It 
is no longer a case of parasitism. 
It is a case of mutual cooperation." 

SHE tore 'her hand away, "What 
are you talking about?" 
"We have a disease of our own, 
remember. It is a reverse disease; 
one of unrestrained growth. We've 
mentioned it already as a contrast 
to the Inhibition Death. Well, what 



is the cause of cancer? How long 
have biologists, physiologists, biochemists and all the others been 
working on it? How much success 
have they had with it? Why? Can't 
you answer that for yourself now?" 

Rose frowned at him. She said, 
slowly, "No, I can't. What are you 
talking about?" 

"It's all very well to say that jf 
we could remove the parasite, we 
would once again have the privilege 
of eternal growth and life if we 
wanted it; or least until we got tired 
of being too big or of living too 
long, and did away with ourselves 
neatly. But how many millions of 
years has it been since the human 
body has had occasion to grow in 
such an unrestrained fashion? Can 
it do so any longer? Is the chemistry 
of the body adjusted to that? Has 
it got the proper whatchamacallits ?" 

"Enzymes," prompted Rose in a 
whisper. 

' 'Yes, enzymes. It's impossible 
for us. If, for any reason, the 
pseudo-gene, as Harg Tholan calls 
it, does leave the human body, or 
if its relationship to the human 
mind is in any way impaired, 
growth does take place, but not in 
any orderly fashion. We call the 
growth cancer. 

"And there you have it, Rose. 
There's no way of getting rid of 
the parasite. We're together for all 
eternity. So that to gel rid of their 
Inhibition Death, extraterrestrials 
must first wipe out all vertebrate 
life on Earth. There is no other 



HOSTESS 



721 



solution for them, and so we must 
keep knowledge of it from them. 
Do you understand ?" 

She rose from her chair. Her 
mouth was dry and it was difficult 
to talk. "I understand, Drake." 

She noticed 'that his forehead was 
damp and that there was a line of 
perspiration down each cheek. 

She said, tightly, "And now 
you'll have to get it out of the 
apartment." 

' ' I know. I've made arrangements. It's late at night and I'll 
be able to get the body out of the 
bu ilding. From there on — ' ' he 
turned to her — "I don't know 
when I'll be back." 

Rose said again, "I understand, 
Drake." 

Harg Tholan was heavy. Drake 
had to drag him through the apartment. Rose -turned away, retching. 
She hid her eyes until she heard 
Hie front door close. She whispered 
again to herself, "I understand, 
Drake." 

IT WAS 3 A. M. Nearly an hour 
had passed since she had heard 
the front door click gently into 
place behind Drake and his burden. 
She didn't know where he was go. ing, what he intended doing — 
She sat there numbly. There was 
no desire to sleep; no desire to 
move. She kept her mind traveling 
in ti gjfat circles, away from the 
thing she knew and which she 
wanted not to know. 
Pseudo-genes ! 



Was it only a coincidence or was 
it some queer racial memory, some 
tenuous long-sustained wisp of 
tradition or insight, stretching back 
through incredible millennia, that 
kept current the odd myths of human beginnings? The stories of the 
golden ages, the Gardens of Eden 
in which Man had eternal life, until he lost it. 

She had called the pseudo-genes 
a disease of the soul. Was that the 
memory again? The memory of the 
world in which sin entered, in 
which the soul grew diseased, and 
into which, as a consequence, death 
entered ? 

Yet despite her efforts, the circle 
of her thoughts expanded, and returned to Drake. She shoved and 
it returned; she counted to herself, 
she recited the names of the objects 
in her field of vision, she cried. 
No, no, no, and it returned. It kept 
returning. 

Drake had lied , to her. It had 
been a plausible story. It would 
have held good under most circumstances; but Drake was not a biologist. 

Cancer could not be, as Drake 
had said, a disease that was an expression of a lost ability for any 
normal growth. 

Cancer attacked children while 
they were still growing; it could 
even attack embryonic tissue. It attacked fish, which, like extraterrestrials, never stopped growing while 
they lived, and died only by disease 
or accident. It attacked plants," for 




 



many of which the same could be 
said. 

Cancer had nothing to do with 
the presence or absence of normal 
growth. It was the general disease 
of life, to which no tissues of any 
multicellular organism were completely immune. 

He should not have bothered 
lying. He should not have allowed 
some obscure sentimental weakness 
to persuade him to avoid the necessity of killing her in that manner. 
She would tell them at the Institute. 
The parasite could be beaten ! Its 
absence would not cause cancer. 
But who would believe her? 

She put her hands over her eyes 
and rocked gently to and fro. The 
young men who disappeared were 
usually in the first year of their 
marriage. Whatever the process of 
rejuvenation among the strains of 
the pseudo-genes, it must involve 
close association with another strain 
— as in the case of conjugation 
among the protozoa. That was how 
the pseudo-genes had to spread infection; through the formation of 
the gametes and their subsequent 
fertilization, a mixing of strains. 

Drake had been on Hawkin's 
Planet. He knew too much about 



Hawkinsites not to have been there 
at least once. 

She could feel her thoughts slowly disconnect. They would be coming to her. They would be saying, 
Where is Harg Tholan? And she 
would answer, With my husband. 
Only they would say, W here is 
your husband? because he would 
be gone, too. 

She knew that, anyway. He needed her no longer. He would never 
return. They would never find him, 
because he would be out in space. 
She would report them both, 
Drake Smollett and Harg Tholan, 
to the Missing Persons Bureau. 

She wanted to weep, but couldn't. She was dry-eyed and it was 
very painful. 

And then she began to giggle. 
She couldn't stop; it just went on. 

After all, it was very funny. She 
had looked for the answers to so 
many questions and had found them 
all. She had even found the answer 
to the question she thought had no 
bearing on the subject. 

She had finally learned why 
Drake had married her. 

Not a conjugal relationship — 

Conjugation.

Man of Destiny 

By JOHN CHRISTOPHER 



Illustrated by PETER BUR CHARD 



A newly discovered planet is a setup 
for a sharp go-getter who knows what 
he is after. That is, it should be!

THEY clock the spaceships in 
from the main control tower 
seventeen miles southeast of 
Tycho. The magnesium flares blossom out against the stars and the 
searching telescopes find them and 
name them. The Ehslra back from 
Procyon, the Alte Wien from Ltimcn III, the Winston from Sirius. 
Ships laden with passengers and 
freight from halfway across the 
visible universe, controlled corks 



bobbing up through the maelstrom 
of time and space to that same 
narrow arc of the lunar sky. They 
come in on time — solar time. 
There"s no danger to life or goods 
or schedule. 

It wasn't always so. When the 
slip process was first being developed, there were both danger and 
uncertainty for those isolated men, 
strapped in their bubbles of metal 
and plastic, who voyaged out across 




MAN OF DESTINY 



an alien dimension to the far 
reaches of the sky. Their job was 
to take routine star pictures and 
then come back on the reverse. But 
the reverse did not always work. 
They were stranded then, hundreds 
or thousands of light-years from 
the placet they had known as 
home. 

From the moment the reverse 
failed, Theodore Pike concentrated 
on the lucky side of his situation. 
He might have been lost in the remotenesses of interstellar space, 
condemned to suffocation when his 
meager oxygen supply gave out — 
a week of waiting for death unless 
he had the courage to seek it out 
first. 

As it was, he was slap in the 
middle of a solar System, a mailer 
of three hundred million miles 
from a blue giant. The system, as 
he had planned it for the report 
that would not now be made, was 
not of any notable size. There were 
only three planets. One was very 
large and impossibly distant from 
the sun. But there was some hope 
in the other two. In size they were 
reasonable enough. He arrowed 
down toward the first of them three 
days later; and at once set the coracle climbing up again, through a 
methane atmosphere, from a barren 
and unrewarding surface. 

That left one planet. Only one. 

When he released the hood and 
the planet's air came in, it was like 
the first time he had tasted wine, 
in the late spring at Heidelberg, 



under the gaudy cherry blossoms. 
He lifted his body clear and slid 
down the still warm metal of the 
spheroid to the mossy ground. The 
moss was dark green, and deep and 
springy. His feet went down two 
or three inches, but there was resilience even beneath that. 

He looked up at the sky. It had 
a. strange and strangely warm green 
tinge; the sun was hidden behind 
tufted blue-green clouds. He looked 
toward where it should be with 
contemptuous, good-humored acknowledgment. It had done its job; 
he was all right now. Then he 
stood easily erect beside the spheroid, watching the natives hesitantly 
approaching from the village fifty 
yards away. 

They were humanoid bipeds, 
with a natural green-tinged fur, 
but wearing artificial decorations 
and the beginnings of clothing. Hestood quite still as they approached. 
Ten yards away, with a slow and 
somehow graceful ceremony, they 
all knelt. They rested their heads 
on the green moss. When he spoke, 
they looked up. He beckoned and 
they came closer. Their leader knelt, 
again at his feet. Quite casually 
Theo put one foot on the prostrate 
head. 

It was accomplished. The natives 
had found their god. 

THE first few months passed 
very quickly. He had set himself one task — to learn the language. After that, the life of Reilly.

Things were already very pleasant. 
The bed made of something like 
swansdown, the spiced and delicate 
foods, the sweet yellow wine which, 
by a dispensation of Providence, 
bad a far less intoxicating effect on 
him than on the natives. They got 
drunk on it; a cheerful, happy 
drunk every seventh or eighth day. 
He was able to preside over their 
revels benignly enough, mellowed 
and happy enough himself in — as 
he reflected sardonically — his divine 
way. 

He had been figuring on a week 
of seven days and only later discovered that the natives had a ten 
month year. The four months thus 
f ar had been rather less than one 
of them, but at the end of that time 
he could communicate well enough. 

He called the chief, Pernar, into 
the hut that he had once owned 
and gave the preliminary directions 
for the building of his palace. The 
natives already had fire, but had 
not applied it to the working of 
metals. He gave them that, and the 
spoked wheel. They were enough 
to be going on with, in addition 
to the supreme, never-ending boon 
of his own personal godhead. He 
had found an outcrop of good granite, tinged with rosy green in the 
prevailing light of the planet, less 
than three miles from the village. 

The palace went up fast. He took 
it over with due ceremony. The natives were puzzled but respectful. 

That was where the settling 
down began. At one time, at the 



beginning, he had held vague hopes 
of being rescued through the slip. 
He had even planned great beacon 
towers spaced across the planet. But 
more sober reflection proved them 
futile. Even with every imaginable 
success,, the Mendola process could 
not be studding the universe with 
ships enough to make the possibility 
of this planet's discovery more than 
fantastically remote. This was a life 
sentence. 

He had something bigger to do 
now. He would leave something 
for the exploring slip-ships to find: 
a civilization founded on a manifest divinity. At its heart a shrine, 
and in its shrine the memory of 
what Theodore Pike had made of 
his exile. 

In the eighth month of the 
planet's year, he provided the steam 
engine. 

THE natives stood around with 
their usual impeccable gravity; Pernar surrounded by his men, 
and even the bolder of the women 
and children. The tiny model 
hissed ; the small piston began to 
work the wheel. 

"In this, my people, is your future," Theo told them. "With this 
your labor will be lightened, your 
fields made fruitful. Your ships and 
wagons will cross the wide spaces 
of the world. All this your lord 
brings to his people." 

They nodded solemnly and 
bowed. The sun was at its zenith, 
where its light concentrated into an 



MAN OF DESTINY 



127 



astonishing blueness. Every day at 
this time the green became blue 
for an hour; by now, an ordinary 
miracle. He looked over their heads 
toward the dazzling sapphire of 
his palace. At its threshold stood 
the two gigantic replicas of his own 
image. The small white jet of steam 
climbed unwaveringly. Eventually 
there would have to be a larger 
palace, he reflected. But still here, 
in this spot, still enshrining the 
spheroid and the spot where it had 
landed. 

Who would be in it? he wondered to himself. He had thought 
of it before; it was his most sustaining fantasy. The great slip-ship 
settling down into this blue-green 
world, being taken (as the tradition 
would demand) to the shrine of 
the great palace-temple, looking 
with astonishment — and respect ? 
pride?— on the first interstellar coracle, the tomb of Theodore Pike. 
What would .the visitors be like? 
They would be respectful, anyway. 
They would be proud of the memory of the first of their line. His 
name would leap through the vast 
gulfs that now cut him off from 
all his youth might have enjoyed. 
That made up for everything. 

'But everything was quite a lot. 

FOLLOWING Theo's demonstration, the natives seemed in 
no hurry to adopt the steam engine. 
Every now and then the elders 
would come to watch the little 
model puffing away. Theo explained 



it to them several times, and they 
nodded their heads in respectful 
approval. But all their working 
time now was being devoted to the 
harvest. The whole tribe — men, 
women, children — toiled in the 
fields through the long hot days. 

Even in his natural indolence lie 
was aware of a sense of urgency 
about their labor; they worked on 
their holiday now, only getting 
drunk when the green twilight had 
darkened into night. He had the 
shrewd sense not to interfere. A 
natural rhythm of the tribe, he 
guessed, best modified by the fundamental change in environment 
which his technology would inevitably create. 

He went out into the fields one 
day to watch them, Pernar, the 
chief, was sweating with the rest. 
Theo lay back in the springy moss 
and watched them. He noticed idly 
that the wagons carrying produce- — 
mounted now on his' wheels, the 
old crude wooden skids having 
been discarded — did not go back 
to the village, but away up the 
slope, in the opposite direction. He 
asked Pernar why. 

Pernar explained, "Against the 
Time, Lord." 

"The time?" 

Pernar paused for a moment, 
fumbling. At last he used a word 
Theo had not heard before. 

"What's that?" 

Pernar said awkwardly, "The 
wild air . . . the water." 

A rainy season ! Theo under 


128 




 



stood. It was reasonable enough 
that the harvest had to be in before the rains came. But that didn't 
explain the wagons trekking away 
uphill. He asked Pernar again. 

"At the Time, we retreat. It is 
necessary." 

"Necessary" was a common and 
useful word in the vocabulary of 
the natives; it stood for anything 
they were in the habit of doing. 
Eventually he would do something 
about it himself. But now H wis 
pleasant enough to lie back in the 
green moss and watch his people 
going about their business. Let this 
coming rainy season pass in the 
usual way; next year he would 
really get down to pouring them 
into his mold — into the necessary 
mold for the empire that he would 
build and leave as his record to 
those ships a thousand years in the 
future. 

THE sky thicken ed into cloud 
over a period of several days; 
from thin twists and strands low 
on the horizon to ropes and 
bunched masses, and, finally, a universal, paralyzing gray. Two days 
after this unbroken canopy had 
settled over them, Pernar came to 
him in the palace. 

"Lord, it is the Time." 
Theo said, "How long will your 
people be gone?" 

Pernar was startled. "You are 
not coming with us, Lord?" 

"For you in your huts, the retreat may be necessary; these gran


ite walls are protection enough 
against the wild air. In other years, 
you, too, will have refuges like this. 
Go in peace now." 

Pernar nodded reluctantly. "Your 
other servants, Lord ..." 

He was referring to the personal 
servants who attended the god-king 
in his palace. 

"They will be safe here," Theo 
said. 

"They will not stay. Lord. They 
dare not stay." 

The best argument, Theo realized, was acquiescence. When they 
returned to find the palace, still 
standing beside the storm-blasted 
huts of the village, that would be 
the real conviction. He said simply, 
"Let food and drink be made ready. 
For how long ?** 

"Two weeks." 

"Two weeks, then." 

He was aware of loneliness when 
the last of them had gone, up the 
rising ground to whatever ritual 
refuge they used against the storms. 
Now once more he was conscious 
of his isolation, cut off from his 
own people by uncountable galactic 
miles, by the long sweep of time 
itself. Only the realization of destiny made the future seem worth 
while. He was pleased, in a way, 
when the rising wind began to 
howl about the village. The savageness of the elements gave him. 
something to measure himself 
against. 

But he was not prepared for the 
fury that developed. The storm 



MAN OF DESTINY 



129 



rose from climax to climax; rain 
belted down torrentially from the 
raging skies. On the third day it 
rose to hurricane force. 

From an embrasure slit, he 
watched the pitiful native huts torn 
from their moorings and flung like 
tattered leaves about the swirling 
sky. It seemed impossible that there 
could be more violence, but more 
came. The air shrieked in protest, 
a high-pitched wail under the constant lash. Theo watched it in 
amazement. 

He was more amazed still when 
Pernar came to him, drenched and 
battered from his voyage through 
the storm. 

"You must come. Lord." 

"Into that?" He pointed out into 
the storm. "You'd better stay here 
yourself now." 

"The water . . . the water that 
rises." 

"Floods? This place is high 
enough. We're all right here." 

"You must come, Lord." 

The argument between them 
went on as th e late af ter n oon 
passed into night. And with nightfall, astonishingly, the rain stopped 
and the gale dropped. Theo said to 
Pernar triumphantly, "You see?" 

For answer Pernar insisted on 
dragging him outside into the open. 
The ground was soggy underfoot; 
the mashed remains of the huts lay 
before them. Pernar pointed- On 
the far horizon a glow became increasingly brilliant against the thinning clouds. The cloud strands 



twisted and broke, and, in the interval of clear sky, he saw it. 

A moon. A giant, gibbous moon 
poised above the skyline like a 
grinning skull. 

But how? He knew this planet 
had no satellite. 

When he considered things, it 
was obvious enough. One of the 
other two planets in the system, 
almost certainly the nearer one, with 
the methane atmosphere, was eccentrically orbited. It was this the natives measured their year by— the 
regular approach and the attendant 
perturbations. All their life, inevitably, must be regulated by it. 

Pernar said, "The rising water, 
Lord . . ," 

He understood that, too. With 
one last glance at his sand-castle 
palace, he said, "Let's go." 

THE refuge was under the rocky 
knpb of the hill's carapace, a 
natural cave hollowed out and improved by the work of generations. 
They arrived there with less than 
an hour to spare. Theo watched, 
with Pernar and the others, the 
brilliant globe that put out the 
light of the usual stars in a sky now 
clear and unclouded again. And he 
watched the tidal wave surge like 
a moving mountain of water to 
within twenty feet of where they 
crouched. 

Watching it lap the land, almost 
at their feet, he considered the kind 
of courage that could have made 
Pernar go down into that doomed 



130 




 



valley to rescue him. Nor was it 
any easily dismissed compulsion of 
religion. He had been fooling himself about that. You did not rescue 
a god from the consequences of his 
folly. 

They were a peaceable and docile 
people. They had accepted his commands and they had given him service; if he wanted to be a god, they 
were willing to let him. But they 
weren't his subjects or his disciples. 
More important than 'those things, 
they were his friends. 

There was still much he could 
give them, but more, he suspected, 
that they would give him. 

Finding himself not a god was 
a relief, somehow. It was less of a 
strain to be human and fallible. 

THE floods receded, and the tribe 
moved again into the valley. 
As the great blue sun burned the 
water out of the steaming soil, they 
set to work to plant the seeds again 
and to rebuild the vanished huts. 

Theo worked with them. He 
found an unexpected satisfaction 
in these labors, and an increasingly 
deeper realization of the nobility 
of these creatures who seemed to 
be without even the slightest trace 
of mutual hostility or anger. They 
accepted his working with them in 
the fields as casually as they had 
previously accepted his overlordship; the difference was that now 
he was one of them and wanted 
no more than the awareness of that 
oneness. 



Sometimes, especially when he 
passed the broken and scattered 
stone of what had been his palace, 
he remembered the world he had 
tome from, and that great ship that 
— in a hundred years, a thousand, 
a hundred thousand — might drop 
through the green glow of the sky. 
But the memory and the thought 
were tinged with fear. Fear of anything that might tome to disrupt 
'the beauty and peace of this undemanding life. 

When the planting was over, 
there was the season of recreation. 
They danced, supple, graceful, unhurried dances, to the music of 
flutclike instruments; and chanted 
poems whose tenderness he understood more clearly as his mind 
grew more at home in their liquid 
but sinewy tongue. 

Day after day, week after week. 
Work and rest and laughter and 
song. Where he had once asked for 
worship, he found himself almost 
reverent. 

He had not guessed there could 
be such joy in humility. 

When he died, twenty of the 
planet's years later, he had been 
their loved and respected chief for 
nearly fifteen years. Only you 
couldn't call it chief, nor had he 
done so. 

They buried him in his former 
palace, which had gradually become 
a mausoleum. His last request was 
to have the steam engine buried 
with him.

He had only to ask and all the knowledge 
of the universe would be his. But first 
he had to know what the questions were! 



IT BEGAN with the crutch. 
Then came the iron hook, then 
the first mechanical limbs. And 
finally — 

Bedlam. Thin metal legs switching by, a moving forest of scissors. 
Metal arms flashing in balance; 

ASK ME ANYTHING 



torsos of metal, like bright dented 
beetles. Round metal skulls that 
cupped the swift wink and unmoving stare of human eyes. 

Krisch, watching them in his 
desk scanner, kept the volume 
turned down. The unit walls were 

133 



deliberately made sound-reflecting; 
the children grew up in the atmosphere of their own clattering noise, 
and they learned to shout against 
it. To soldiers so reared, there 
would be no terror in the roar of* 
battle. But Krisch, who was only 
human, wore earplugs when he 
walked among them. 

The river of metal funnel ed into 
classrooms, stopped. Lights flashed 
on over the scanners, on the board 
that covered the twenty-foot wall 
facing Krisch's desk. Instruction 
had begun. 

Krisch watched the board for a 
while, then switched on the illuminated panel that carried his notes, 
and began to dictate his weekly 
report. He was a small, spare man, 
with thinning strands of iron-gray 
hair reached stiffly back over his 
freckled brown scalp. His mouth 
was straight, and the lines around 
it showed that he never smiled; but 
there was a glint of controlled, 
ironic humor in his watchful eyes. 

A bell spoke and a red light 
gleamed. Krisch looked up sharply, 
identified the scanner under the 
warning light, and transferred its 
image to his own desk screen. Half 
a thousand pairs of .eyes stared back 
at him from the massed metal forms 
in the amphitheater. 

Krisch set the playback cube for 
one minute preceding. The robot 
instructors were equipped to answer 
all permissible questions; therefore, 
a non -permissible question had just 
been asked. 



The harsh voice of the robot 
said, "—along the inguinal canal 
and enters the abdomen through 
the internal abdominal ring. Yes? 
What is your question ?" 

There was a pause. Krisch 
scanned the rows of gleaming 
heads, could not tell which one 
had signaled "Question." Then the 
abnormally loud but stilt childish 
voice spoke, and simultaneously the 
student's number appeared in the 
recording circle at the lower left 
corner of the screen. Krisch started 
it automatically. The ten-year-old 
voice bellowed : 

"What is a kiss?" 

THERE was a five-second pause. 
The robot answered, "Your 
question is meaningless. It has been 
reported to the Director and you 
will hold yourself in readiness for 
his orders. ' ' Then i t resumed its 
lecture. 

Krisch switched the scanner back 
to normal operation. The robot was 
now discussing the prostate gland. 
Krisch waited until it had reached 
the end of a sentence and then 
pressed the "Attention" button on 
his console. He said, "Cadet ER17235 will report to the Director's 
Office immediately." He cleared the 
board and sank back in his cushioned chair, frowning. 

A non-permissible question was 
bad enough in itself ; there had not 
been one In the oldest class in the 
last six years of the Project's existence. It was not only bad; it wa.s 




 



indefensible. Logically, it .should 
not have happened — the entire student body of the unit, according to 
a check made not a week ago, was 
correctly conditioned. 

But that was not all. The robot 
instructor had been perfectly truthful, to the extent of its own knowledge, when it had said the cadet's 
question was meaningless. The subject of normal human love relationships was not on the curriculum for two more years. To introduce it earlier, with the desired 
effect of repugnance, would seriously damage discipline. 

Krisch turned his selector to the 
appropriate list, but he knew the 
answer already. The word "kiss" 
was not in the student's vocabulary. 
And there was no one in the Unit, 
besides himself, from whom the 
cadet could have learned it. 

Krisch stood up and went to the 
transparent wall behind his deskone huge window that looked out 
on the parade ground and beyond 
it to the chill, airless surface of the 
planet. Only starlight gleamed from 
the jagged points of that landscape 
which faced eternally away from 
the sun; the force screen that maintained the Unit's atmosphere also 
acted as a light trap. 

He could look up and see, one 
thousand light-years away, the cold 
dim glow that was the cluster of 
which Cynara was a part, and the 
whole frightening majesty of space 
in between. But a hypothetical 
enemy scout, pausing in space to 



scan this waste planet, would see 
nothing but a tiny disk of blackness that might be a vitreous plain, 
or the crater of a long-dead volcano. 

KRISCH had been here a little 
more than ten years, moving 
along from one installation to the 
next with his class, turning over 
the vacated office and its duties to 
the next lowest man in the. hierarchy. Each year, a new Director 
was shipped out with a new load 
of embryos and equipment, and at 
the end of ten more years, Krisch 
would be permanently installed as 
director of the final Unit, and as 
senior officer of the entire Project. 
That was all he had to look forward to, for the rest of his life. 
Many ships arrived here, but none 
left, or would ever leave, except 
those that carried the troops thems e! v es when th cy were n ecd ed . 
Krisch's rewards were sol itudc, 
achievement, power, and the partial satisfaction of a boundless 
curiosity. 

His penalty, if the Project were 
to fail or even be seriously delayed 
while it was under his command, 
would be painful and humiliating. 
He would not even be allowed bo 
die. 

The door speaker said, "Cadet 
ER-1723*> reporting as ordered, 
sir." 

Krisch returned to his desk. He 
said, "Enter." 

The metal thing stalked into the 



ASK ME ANYTHING 



135 



room and stood at attention in front 
of the Director's desk. Only the 
absolute minimum of it was organic: the boy's head, pared to a 
functional ball, the blue eyes staring through the metal skull-piece, 
a surgically simplified torso, the 
limb stumps. By itself, it would be 
no more than an unpleasant, useless lump of meat; but, housed in 
the metal body, it was a sketch of 
the perfect fighting man. 

The cadet, like the rest of his 
class, was only ten years old. Raised 
from an embryo in a plastic sack, 
the living part of him had been 
transferred many times from one 
articulated metal shell to another. 
For that reason, his present body 
was comparatively crude. When he 
reached his full growth, he would 
be given his final body — so fantastically armored as to be almost indestructible, so powerful that it 
could outrun any land vehicle over 
broken terrain. The weapons built 
into his arms, controlled d irectly 
by his nerves, would be sufficient 
to destroy a city. 

And he would be completely 
without fear. 

Krisch let the silence frown between them while the boy stood at 
attention. Just now, the boy knew 
tension. It was necessary for discipline, and the repressed hostility 
toward Krisch would later be translated into a useful hatred for all 
non-mechanical human beings. To 
use physical pain as a means of 
punishment was out of the ques


tion, a total impossibility. That, in 
fact, was the root idea of the entire 
Project. 

THE crutch went back to prehistoric times. The metal hook, 
to replace a lost hand, was born 
early in the Iron Age. The Twentieth Century knew prosthetic devices which looked almost like 
flesh, and adequately performed all 
mechanical functions of natural 
limbs. But it remained for the 
galactic culture and the warlike nation which Krisch was a part of to 
discover that artificial limbs could 
be more than a lesser evil; that the 
metal arm, the metal finger, was 
better than flesh. Better. Its cleverly 
articulated segments reported pressure, temperature and position at 
least as well as flesh. Its strength 
was incomparably greater. And it 
felt no pain. 

Man is so soft, thought Krisch, 
in comparison with the metal he 
uses; so soft, and so easily hurt. 
Every cubic inch of flesh, excepting 
only the brain itself, contains its 
minuscule fuse of agony. But metal 
feels no pain. Those boys will conquer the galaxy; no human troops 
can stand against them. 

He amended the thought. Five 
minutes ago that had been almost 
a certainty. Now it was only possible. 

He said, "Where did you learn 
the word 'kiss' ?" 

The boy's eyelids fluttered behind the steel mask. "From a — " 




 



He hesitated. "A training device, 
sir," he finished uncertainly. 

Kriseh said sharply, "Are you 
sure?" 

A long pause. "I — I think that's 
what it was, sir." 

"You think it was," said Kriseh. 
"Describe this 'training device.' " 

"It's like a human being, sir.** 

"Mechanized, or all flesh?" 

Silence. The boy's eyelids blinked, and Kriseh could imagine the 
rest of the face, screwed up in an 
agony of indecision. 

"Answer the question," Kriseh 
ordered. 

"Neither one, sir," said the boy 
painfully. "It was — " 

"Well? What was it made of?" 

"Of— " 

"Well?" 

"Of — just lines, sir." 

KRISCH sat back a moment, 
looking at the cadet in frowning silence. The boy's hesitant answers showed either that he was 
lying, which was inconceivable, or 
that he was conscious of guilt. 

"Of just lines," he repeated. He 
put a skeptical note into his voice. 
"Explain." 

"That's all, sir," the boy said in 
a rush. "It was made of lines, and 
it looked like a human being, and 
it talked to me." His voice stopped 
abruptly. 

Kriseh pounced on that. "What 
did it talk about?" 

"About — about love, sir." 
Another word the cadets had not 



been taught. "Go on," said Kriseh. 
"What did it say about love?" 

"About one human being loving 
another one. It said that means 
when you know the other human 
being is lonely and unhappy like 
you, and you give the other one 
part of the way you feel about 
yourself, instead of keeping it all. 
And you show how you feel by 
meeting flesh to flesh, and it makes 
you feel wonderful, like killing 
something, but much better." The 
cadet paused. "But I didn't understand about kisses. It seemed to be 
very complicated." 

Kriseh felt a ball of coldness 
.settle- in his chest. This boy was 
ruined; he would have to be 
scrapped. And how many others — ? 

"Where did all this take place?" 
he demanded. 

"During airless maneuvers yesterday, sir." 

Kriseh tried to visualize it: the 
cadets scattered out there in the 
cold blackness, carrying out one of 
the prescribed war games under the 
direction of student squad leaders. 
One of them isolated from the rest, 
waiting for a signal. And while he 
waited, something had approached 
him, and spoken to him of love . . . 
"No one else saw or heard?" 
"No, sir." 

"Why did you fail to report it?" 

A pause. "I thought it was part 
of the training." 

"Tell the truth!" Kriseh snapped. 

The cadet's eyes blinked. As Kriseh watched, horrified, they 



ASK ME ANYTHING 



137 



grew unmistakably moist. "I don't 
know, sir! I don't know!" 

The moisture brimmed over. Two 
tears ran down the shining mask 
that was the boy's face. 

Another signal light blinked red 
On the master board, then another. 
Krisch knew, finally, that the test 
had come ten years ahead of time. 

The Project was at war. 

KRISCH strapped himself into 
the speedster and eased it out 
through the exit tunnel. He had 
put the entire student body through 
interrogation and a psych check, 
and had turned up fifty-three more 
cases of induced aberration. For the 
time being, he had left them all at 
liberty but carefully monitored; he 
hoped that one of them might be 
approached again by the saboteur, 
whoever or whatever it was. 

Something flashed dully in the 
starlight outside the transparent 
nose of the speedster. Krisch stared 
at it, then inched the speedster over 
until the object lay almost directly 
under him. 

It was a cadet, without the spacegear that should have closed the 
openings in his face-plate and made 
his body airtight. The body was 
sprawled lifelessly. The staring eyes 
were blood-red with burst capillaries. 

Krisch peered through the transparent metal and read the serial 
number etched into the cadet's steel 
foreskull. It was the boy he had 
interviewed an hour ago. 



He contacted his desk relays and 
gave orders for the disposal of the 
body and the detention of the 
other fifty-three. For the moment, 
it was all he could do. 

He took the speedster up and 
set its course toward Unit One, 
three hundred miles away. Alter 
his interview with Cadet ER- 17235, 
he had called the Directors of the 
other nine installations and ordered 
immediate psych checks. The results, gathered two hours later, 
showed that every unit had been 
affected. Viar, Director of Unit 
One and the newest member of 
the Project's staff, had had an additional and equally disturbing report to make. 

Krisch watched the backdrop of 
white fire and black velvet move 
ponderously past. Even if he were 
able to remove the disturbing factor before it had done further 
harm, it might prove impossible to 
knit the Project's structure together 
again. The oldest of the cadets had 
not yet reached the stage in which 
the circle of their conditioning 
would be unbreakable. Normal 
emotions and a normal biological 
life had no place in that circle, but 
it was still possible to introduce 
them. The result was — insanity, a 
flood of emotion for which no outlet had been or could be provided; 
impossible desires; the classic insoluble dilemma. 

He remembered the blood-red, 
staring eyes of the dead boy. The 
symbolism was appropriate. H is 




 



eyes were the only organs of expression left to him, and he had 
certainly used them effectively 
enough. 

FOR the first time in many years, 
the Director wished he had 
not been born into a nation with a 
history of thwarted development 
and a psychology of resentment. 
He wished that he were an underpaid pedagogue on a world at 
peace. He wished that he had not 
been forced by circumstances to put 
that boy in a metal cage. 

Viar met him, by request, at the 
bottom level of Unit One, the level 
that housed the huge atomic converter which powered the unit. Viar 
was a youngish man with a large, 
white, perspiring face that expressed conscientiousness and insecurity. His eyes were milk-blue 
surrounded by white lashes. Krisch 
disliked him thoroughly. 

They stood by the shaft that the 
converter had dug in the stone of 
the planet. Viar said nervously, "I 
first noticed that we had stumbled 
on something when I checked the 
meter readings. They showed mostly gr.imtc, but there were occasional 
fluctuations that indicated refined 
metal. I was curious, so I set the 
converter to extract only the stone. 
Yesterday I shut off the converter 
briefly, and sent a cadet down to 
see what was left." 

Krisch looked at the curious 
array of objects spread out on the 
plastic floor. There were three 



metal tablets incised with neat rows 
of dots, ovals, squares, and crosses. 
There was a long curved trough, 
with an attachment at one^end that 
suggested it might have been designed to fit a wrist — or a tentacle. 
There was a set of concentric 
ellipses, with little balls that seemed 
designed to run along them; clearly 
an orrery of this solar system. There 
was a six-foot metal box, curiously 
fashioned in a complexity of intersecting planes. 

Krisch knew that this world 
could not have supported indigenous life more recently than ten 
million years ago; but there was not 
a trace of corrosion in any of the 
artifacts. 

He said, "Why did you fail to 
report this until I called you?" 

Viar said apologetically, "I 
thought it could wait for my weekly report. It didn't seem to have 
any importance, until today. Then 
I noticed that this box was open."' 

Krisch looked at it. The seam 
gaped very slightly around three 
sides. He tested it, and found that 
the enclosed face would not move 
in either 'direction. It seemed unlikely that anything but a gas could 
have escaped. 

HE REMEMBERED the dead 
cadet's description of the 
strange thing that had spoken to 
him on the training ground. "It 
was made of line . . ." None of 
the others had duplicated this 
phrase: they had simply said that 



ASK ME ANYTHING 



it was like a man, but diffe r e nt . 
The fanciful thought occurred to 
him that if the first description was 
correct, and the word "lines" had 
been used mathematically, even this 
millimeter gap would not have been 
necessary. 

"Is it possible that one of the 
cadets could have opened it?" he 
demanded. 

"Perhaps," Viar granted, willing 
to consider every possibility, "but 
it does not seem probahle." He 
gestured toward the box. "I made 
several attempts to open it when I 
first got it out. Perhaps something 
I did had a delayed action. At any 
rate, I would swear that not only 
was it heavier then than it is now, 
but that there was a force-lock of 
some nature holding it shut. I've 
looked in with a microprobe, and 
there is a small mechanism of some 
kind attached to one corner. I believe the box can be opened fully 
now, but I thought I had better 
wait until you COuld inspect it." 

"You believe, then," said Krisch, 
"that there was a device in this 
thing which was still in operation 
until yesterday?" 

Viar looked at him with a trace 
of hangdog defiance. "I believe that 
there was something in that box 
which is still operating now." 

Krisch controlled his irritation 
and said nothing. As Viar escorted 
him back to the exit tube. Krisch 
told him, "Proceed with normal 
activities, but monitor every cadet. 
Open that box, but not inside the 



Unit. And report to me hourly." 
He strapped himself into the speedster again and turned its nose back 
to Unit Ten. 

THREE more cases of aberrant 
conduct were waiting for him, 
and the reports from the other units 
were similar and equally alarming. 
Krisch interviewed a few more, 
then cubed a standard interview 
form and turned the process over 
to robot mechanisms. Viar called 
him later in the day, to report that 
he had succeeded in opening the 
box, but could make nothing of its 
contents. 

Krisch got the collated reports 
from the robot interviewers, and 
ran up a tentative prediction. In 
twenty-six hours, the unknown 
agent — which might or might not 
have escaped from the box unearthed by Viar — had corrupted 
one hundred and fifty-three cadets, 
or approximately one every ten minutes. If it continued at the same 
rate, which, of course, could not 
be assumed with so little data, ten 
per cent of the total student body 
would have been aberrated at the 
end of three hundred hours. 
Twelve and a half Galactic Standard days. At the end of that time, 
Krisch reckoned grimly, the Project would be hopelessly crippled. 

Monitoring the cadets had been 
totally ineffective; Krisch ordered 
it discontinued. His only other defensive move would have been to 
suspend normal activities altogether 



t40 




 



and keep the cadets in monitored 
groups, but that would have had a 
psychological effect nearly as bad 
as the one he was trying to avert. 
He ordered the abcrrees to be confined and then destroyed personally 
by the Director of each Unit, without the knowledge of the student 
leaders. 

He carried out this duty himself 
in Unit Ten, and then went to 
bed. 

HE AWOKE from a nightmare 
in which he had been surrounded by silent metal bodies — 
the bodies of ten-year-old cadets; 
but instead of the egg-shaped headpieces, they had worn open helmets, 
and where their faces should have 
been were raw, bleeding disks of 
flesh. 

Deliberately he relaxed his body 
and sank back onto the sweatdrenched cushion. Then he sat up 
again with a start, realizing that 
what had waked him had been 
someone's entrance into the room. 

And that was simply, starkly impossible. His apartment was guarded while he slept by armored walls 
and a massive door which would 
have held back a division. Moreover, there were alarm devices 
which would signal any attempt to 
enter. Still further, no one in this 
Unit or any other had the slightest 
sane motive for trying to enter 
without permission. 

That realization exploded in his 
mind and faded against the fact 



registered by the outmost corner of 
his vision: There was someone in 
the room. 

He raised his head, looking full 
at the archway that separated his 
sleeping room from his office. He 
saw a dim glow from the instrument panels. 

A strange man stood there. 
That was his first dominant impression; and it was so strong that 
for a long minute, even while he 
saw that he was mistaken, he could 
not rid himself of it. 

The eye does not see a man; it 
sees a grouping of lines which are 
capable of almost infinite variation. 
The visual center interprets those 
lines, compares them with a gestall, 
a perception-of-form, and the mind 
says, "Man." 

With an effort, Krisch put aside 
his preconceptions and accepted 
what he saw. 

He saw a collection of lines that 
enclosed no form. The glow from 
his office shone between them. 
There was a series of curlicues that 
might have suggested hair, then a 
gap, then two incomplete spirals 
that vaguely suggested eyes; another gap and a straight line for a 
nose; farther down, a line for the 
mouth, curved into an idiotic smile. 
On either side was a handle-shaped 
line for the ear. 

The body was like that of a stick 
man drawn by a child; one line 
for the torso, two for the arms, 
two for the legs, and three stiffly 
curling lines for each hand. 



ASK ME ANYTHING 



14J 



The figure said, "Ask me anything." 

The voice spoke without sound, 
the words coming spontaneously 
into Krisch's mind, as if written 
with a phosphorescent crayon on a 
sheet of black glass. Krisch realized this without surprise, and briefly wondered why. Then he recalled 
the interview with the first cadet. 
The boy had said he had spoken 
with the "training device" outside 
the Unit area, during airless 
maneuvers. 

Krisch thought, "Who are you?" 
The answer was immediate. "I 
am a device to entertain and instruct you. Ask me anything." 

Krisch's hand rested on the 
■button that controlled a battery of 
force-pencils focused on the area 
in front of his couch, but he had 
no intention of using it. There was 
every reason to suspect that such 
methods would fail; and, if they 
did, he would have surrendered 
his only chance. 

He decided to take the tiling at 
its word. "How can you be destroyed ?" 

"I cannot be destroyed." 
"How can you be immobilized, 
then?" 

"By — " The figure went on without a pause, but visual images replaced the words. There were, 
Krisch realized, no words in his 
language for those images. They 
flashed briefly before him, each 
one trailing glimpses of the process 
that produced it. Krisch could not 



even retain the sequence, much less 
interpret it. 

"Repeat," he thought. 

The same images came and went. 
At the end of it, Krisch knew that 
he would never learn anything useful from them. What he was seeing was the terminal end of a 
thousand-year chain of technology. 
He could not expect to grasp it 
from one simple explanation, any 
more than a savage could be taught 
metallurgy in a single lecture. 

Krisch remembered, with panic, 
that the thing's average indoctrination period was ten minutes. He 
said, "What governs the length of 
time you stay with one person?" 

"If he asks me to stay, I stay." 

KRISCH relaxed for the first 
time since he had seen the 
figure standing there in the doorway. I f that was true, then his 
battle was won. 

"There are a great many questions I want to ask you," he 
thought. "Stay with me until I ask 
you to go." 

There was no reply. 
He demanded, "Will you do as 
I ask?" 
"Yes." 

Fully awake now, Krisch raised 
the back rest of the cushion and 
pressed the buttons for nourishment. His mind was racing. A 
thought was half-born in his mind 
that made him tremble. He asked, 
"Of what substance are you composed ?" 



142 




 



The figure said, "Of no subStance. I am the Pattern." 

Krisch leaned forward. "Do you 
mean that you are not material?" 

"I am not material. I am a pattern of forces which adapts itself 
to each individual I serve. You see 
the sketch of a man. My makers 
would see something quite different." 

"Are you intelligent?" 

"I am not intelligent. I have no 
will or independent existence. I am 
merely a device for answering questions." 

Krisch thought for a moment. 
He said, "A minute ago you described yourself as the Pattern. Does 
that mean you arc the only one of 
your kind ever created ?" 

"No. There were many others, 
but the race that came after my 
makers did not like us. We disturbed them. Therefore they imprisoned us, like the jhm in your 
legend, since they could not destroy 
us." 

Krisch asked, "Are you capable 
of lying?" 
"No." 

That was the central question, 
and unfortunately the answer meant 
nothing. Hut Krisch was beginning 
to sec a strong possibility that his 
first estimate of the thing as a saboteur was mistaken. The other explanation fitted the facts more 
readily and completely. The Pattern 
was what it called itself, "a device 
to entertain and instruct you." It 
presented itself to a cadet who was 



alone and idle — probably it had 
been designed never to interfere 
with anyone who had something 
better to do. The cadet asked questions; the Pattern answered them. 
At the end of ten minutes or so, 
for a cadet was rarely unoccupied 
for longer, the cadet released it and 
it looked for another client. 

And because the fields about 
which the cadets were most curious 
were precisely those whose knowledge would d estroy them — they 
went insane. 

THE Pattern had said "the race 
that came after my makers did 
not like us." It was understandable. 
Every culture had its areas of forbidden knowledge and politely ignored facts. The Pattern would be 
inhibited in those areas, where its 
own makers were concerned. But 
in an alien society, its truthful answers could be explosive. 

Krisch asked, "Were you intended for the use of children, or of 
adults?" 

"For the use of both." 
The knowledge he wanted was 
there, then, and by asking enough 
questions, he could get it. You 
could not teach metallurgy to a 
savage in one lecture, or even in 
one day — but you could teach him. 

Assuming that the Pattern was 
truthful, there was still one open 
question that gave Krisch reason to 
hesitate. An absolutely truthful 
oracle could be a dangerous thing: 
witness the insanity of the cadets, 



ASK ME ANYTHING 



143 



and the "disturbance" of "the race 
that came after our makers.'" 
Krisch's mind was not the artificial, 
delicately balanced creation that the 
cadets' were, but he knew very well 
that he had areas of instability; he 
could even concede that there might 
be such areas of which he was not 
aware. Could he ask the right questions — the ones which would not 
evoke dangerous answers ? 

He thought so. What he wanted 
from the Pattern was nothing that 
could be intimately bound up with 
his emotional drives or the structure 
of his ego; he wanted technical information. 

Prove to a religious fanatic that 
there is no God, and you destroy 
him. But give him a flamethrower, 
and he will destroy the ungodly. 





 



Finally, there was the question 
that capped all others: just how 
had the Pattern kept up an average 
rate of one cadet every ten minutes, 
counting the time spent in traveling 
from one Unit to the next, and in 
finding an available subject? 

The answer was the one Krisch 
had suspected and hoped for. The 
Pattern moved by instantaneous 
transport, out of the normal fabric 
of space-time. 

"How?" asked Krisch. Again hegot a series of incomprehensible 
images. "Explain that first picture," 
said Krisch, and "Break that down 
further," and "What is that component?" And, very slowly, the 
Pattern began to teach him. 

THE problem of limiting the Pattern's activities while Krisch 
slept bothered him. He solved it, 
finally, by setting up a pool of 
cadets to be admitted by a robot 
monitor, one at a time, into a room 
where the Pattern could talk to 
them without interruption. As soon 
as one cadet stopped asking questions, he was removed and another 
was admitted. Krisch found j that 
although the Pattern could plant 
the seeds of insanity in a cadet in 
less than ten minutes, it took an 
average of nearly two hours to reduce the same cadet to such a mindless state that he was no longer 
useful as a questioner. Thus, during each of Krisch's six-hour sleep 
periods, the Pattern disposed of 
only three cadets. During the re


maining eighteen hours of each day, 
Krisch kept it fully occupied. 

All knowledge is power, rightfully applied. But Krisch needed a 
particular kind of lever, and a special place to stand. Slowly and 
painfully, he was getting it. 

The balance of forces which had 
made the cadets possible and necessary included, as one of its basic 
assumptions, transport at finite 
speeds. Under this limiting condition, attack from space on a fortified planet was enormously costly 
and by itself could not succeed. It 
was necessary for the attacker to 
expend twenty ships in order to 
land one. Thereafter, the war proceeded on the ground, under the 
enemy's own defensive umbrella, as 
wars had always been fought — in 
hand-to-hand, street-to-street combat. Superiority in ground troops, 
therefore, could be the decisive factor. 

But an object moving instantaneously could not, by definition, be 
interrupted or affected in any way 
while in transit. And therefore the 
man who brought the secret of 
such transport to Cynara or any 
other great power could ask his 
own price. Since the power which 
bought the secret would shortly 
rule the galaxy, the price would be 
high. 

If Krisch had been required to 
understand everything he was 
taught, the project would have been 
nearly hopeless. As it was, his task 
was difficult enough. The Pattern's 



ASK ME ANYTHING 



145 



knowledge included minutely detailed plans for every stage of the 
operation that was required, and 
for all die subsidiary operations that 
produced the components, and the 
still more subsidiary operations that 
produced them. 

KRISCH had to follow these 
step by painful step, like a 
savage smelting ore to build a 
smeltery to smelt the ore better, to 
build a foundry to cast the metal 
to make tools that made other tools 
that built a machine that built another machine to draw wire, that 
another machine shaped and 
threaded. Result, a bolt. 

He stopped sending his weekly 
reports. The next ship to Cynara 
was not due for six months, and it 
would take more than two years 
for a ship to reach him after his 
message carriers stopped arriving. 
He glanced at the master board in 
his office only twice a day, when 
he awoke and before he went to 
bed. The rest of the time he spent 
with the Pattern in the Unit's machine shops and laboratories. 

Minor breakdowns occurred, but 
he grudged the time to attend to 
them. Repair machines broke down 
and were not replaced from stock; 
thereafter, when anything went 
wrong with a robot instructor or 
monitor, it remained out of action. 
Cadets went to their assigned classrooms, but heard no lectures. Krisch 
saw a few of these, with more initiative than the rest, wandering 



around the corridors. He ignored 
them. The Project simply did not 
matter any longer, by comparison 
with the weapon he was forging 
under the Pattern's direction. 

He allowed the weekly cubes 
from the other nine Directors to 
pile up unread on his desk. On the 
fifteenth morning, the green light 
of the inter-unit communicator was 
blinking as he entered his office. He 
clicked over the switch and saw 
Viar's round, perspiring face .on 
the screen. 

Viar said, "Director Krisch, I've 
been trying to get you since 
eighteen hours yesterday! Is anything wrong at your Unit?" 

"Nothing's wrong," said Krisch 
curtly. "I've been very busy. What 
is it you want?" 

"Why, I was only wondering if 
you'd decided what action to take 
on the special report I sent you 
last week. I don't want to press 
you, but — " 

"I'm considering it," Krisch said. 
"I'll let you know as soon as I 
reach a decision. Is there anything 
else?" 

"Just one other thing. I was 
wondering if there had been any 
more trouble with the saboteur in 
your Unit. I haven't had any for 
two weeks, now, and — " 

"Nor 1," said Krisch. "There's 
nothing we can do on that score 
until it appears again, if it does." 

He broke the contact and 
then sorted the message cubes on 
his desk until he found the 



146 




 



one labeled "Unit One — 1/17/09 
—Special." He dropped it into the 
viewer and scanned it quickly. 

Viar, it appeared, had been doing more archeological research on 
his own initiative. Krisch repressed 
a stab of irritation and read on. 
Viar had widened the converter s 
field and increased its output, using 
the surplus to turn out ingots for 
small converter units, in order to 
excavate a pit two hundred feet 
square by one hundred feet deep. 
The objects he had so far extracted 
showed clearly, he said, that two 
entirely distinct cultures were represented. Those that Krisch had already seen, including the enigmatic 
box, belonged to the later culture, 
and these included several artifacts 
which Viar considered to be weapons. Krisch frowned over this section; it was not elaborated. 

Viar's main point was that, 
judging by pictograms and items 
shaped to the wearers' use, the first 
culture had been so alien biologically and sociologically as to be 

almost incomprehensible— but the 
latecomers had been men. Viar suggested, with a breathless tone showing through his careful phrases, 
that this was a discovery of enor' mous importance to galactic 
archeology and anthropology. Radioactive tests confirmed their 
previous estimate that the planet 
had been dead for more than ten 
million years. 

Therefore, the conclusion was inescapable that mankind had not 



originated on Earth of Sol — that 
there had been a previous wave of 
colonization, so ancient that no 
trace of it had ever been found 
before. 

Viar, Krisch though contemptuously, envisioned a future of academic glory. He wanted Krisch to 
authorize him to dispatch his finds 
immediately to Cynara, with the 
recommendation that a research 
group be set up on the Proj ect 
planet, to be headed, no doubt, by 
Viar himself. 

The notion of independent evolution did even seem to have occurred to him. 

The obvious thing to do was to 
keep him contented, and Krisch was 
inclined to doubt that Viar's discoveries had any importance compared with his own. However, the 
thought of Viar"s cryptic reference 
to weapons returned to him. There 
were two remote but unpleasant 
possibilities there: one, that Viar 
might be hinting that if Krisch 
opposed him, he had force to back 
up his requests; the other, that 
among those weapons, just possibly, 
might be one whose strategic importance to Cynara would overshadow Krisch's. 

IT WOULD be just as well to 
take care of both, and satisfy 
Viar at the same time, if it could 
be done. Krisch thought for a moment, then dictated a memo: 

"Your suggestion is accepted. 
Send all artifacts and relevant data 



ASK ME ANYTHING 



147 



to this office for shipment. I will 
endorse your request for the establishment of a research group and 
will recommend your appointment 
as its head. In the meantime, however, 1 cannot authorize any further use 'of- the Unit One converter 
for excavation .purposes. Discontinue such activity, and use converter ingots pending a reply from 
Cynaia." 

That tied it up. It was not only 
reasonable but accommodating; 
Viar c'ould not disobey instructions 
without open hostility. If he did 
disobey, he could be dealt with. If 
he didn't, Krisch could end any 
possibility of future trouble by removing all weapons from the shipment. 

There was, however, a third 
alternative which Krisch had not 
taken into account, as he discovered when he examined the crates 
Viar sent. They contained a cons id erabl e number an d vari ety of 
artifacts, but not one of them.,, as 
far as Krisch could tell, could possibly be classed as a weapon. 

It <tid not ring true, somehow. 
Viar was simply not the type to 
make even so definite a stand as 
this against a person in authority 
over him. He would intrigue, and 
he would undermine, but he would 
never risk his neck in open conflict. A new weapon would give 
him some false courage, but not, 
Krisch thought, that much. 

A thought struck him. He said 
to the Pattern, "Did you show 



yourself to Viar before you came 
to me?" 
"Yes." 

"Why didn't you tell me?" 
Krisch gestured impatiently. "Never 
mind; X know — I didn't ask you. 
How long did you spend and what 
did you discuss with him?" 

"An hour and twenty minutes. I 
answered his questions about myself, about himself, about those 
who came after my makers, and 
about their weapons. I told him 
where to look for three that were 
in the area he was excavating." 

That was like Viar, at least, 
Krisch thought wryly, to get his 
hands on a fountainhead of power 
and then let go. 

And Viar's sudden aggressiveness was explained. He had been 
shown a path to power, and the 
Pattern had no doubt told him a 
few truths about his timidity and 
lack of drive. Viar was, for the 
time being, a reformed character — 
and an unstable one. 

THE crisis was unwelcome, since 
it came at a time when Krisch 
was almost at the end of his strenuous labors; but he was realistic 
enough to see that it had to be 
dealt with immediately. He considered his problem, made his preparations — which took some time, 
since they included transferring all 
big shop and laboratory equipment 
to the end of a half-mile tunnel 
dug outward from the Unit's perimeter—and then called Viar. 



148 



OA LAX Y SCIENCE FICTION 



Viar's face was arranged in an 
expression of careful deference, 

through whicli cunning and selfcomplaccncy were almost obscenely 
visible. 

Krisch cut through his greeting 
with, "Viar, your instructions were 
to send all the artifacts to me. 
Where are the weapons you mentioned in your report?" 

Viar's features realigned themselves to produce an effect of utter 
surprise. "Why, everything's there," 
he said. "I sent it all over, just as 
yon stipulated." 

"Viar," said Krisch coldly, "you 
unspeakable worm, guilt is written 
all over your face. .What do you 
hope to gain by lying?" 

Viar's white eyelashes blinked, 
and his weak mouth hardened 
slightly, but he replied in the same 
careful, polite tone. "Perhaps something was left out by error, Director Krisch. Let me suggest this — 
send me back the items I gave you, 
and I'll make a careful search before I d i spatch the sh ipmen t to 
Cynara." 

"You mean," Krisch said, "that 
I had better do as you say, or I'll 
get the weapons, but not in the way 
I expect." 

Viar's eyes gleamed. "If you care 
to put it that way, Director." 

Instantly, Krisch launched himself into a storm of abuse. He had 
had nine years' more experience 

at this form of psychological punishment than Viar, and he was a 
past master of the art. He called 



Viar a majority of the filthy names 
in his vocabulary, with special 
emphasis on Viar's putative masculinity, and he delivered the whole 
tirade in a tone of scathing, 
furious contempt. He continued 
without slackening his pace or lowering his voice until lie saw Viar 
redden, turn pale. Then, still without a pause, he accused Viar of 
sabotage and treason. 

Viar exploded. "You talk about 
treason!" he shrieked. "I know 
what you've been tip to over there. 
1 know what's been keeping you 
so busy! You've got that thing 
that escaped from my box, and 
you're pumping secrets out of it, 
to sell to the highest bidder!" 

"Suppose I am?" Krisch demanded swiftly. "What can you do 
about it?" 

VIAR told him. He had warned 
the other eight Directors that 
Krisch was plotting against the 
Project. Krisch was one against 
nine — he'd never get away with it 
— and Viar himself had a beam 
projector that would cut through 
Krisch's force screen like paper . . . 

Krisch had all the information 
he needed. Now he wanted just 
one thing more — to get Viar out 
from behind the protection of his 
own screen. He told Viar, in extremely vulgar terms, to come and 
try it, and added an epithet he had 
been holding in reserve. 

Viar's moon-face went whiter 
than before. His eyes bulged. He 



ASK ME ANYTHING 



149 



opened his mouth to speak, and 
Krisch, grinning with triumph, cut 
him off. 

He had been scathing Viar for 
about ten minutes. He checked 
carefully to make sure that the Pattern was being kept occupied in 
the interrogation room; then he 
got into his battle harness and 
strode down the corridor toward 
the lift. 

Halfway along the corridor was 
a group of cadets. One of them 
was on the floor, his metal body 
contorted and writhing. As Krisch 
approached, the boy began to 
scream at the top of his lungs. 
Krisch winced- He glanced at the 
other cadets, one of whom wore a 
squad leader's insignia. 

"Why isn't he in surgery?" 
Krisch snapped. 

The squad leader said in a bewildered tone of voice, "Surgery 
doesn't work, sir. The control robot there is out of commission. 
What shall we do, sir?" 

More of the unit's services must 
be out than Krisch had realized; 
the victim evidently had some acute 
malfunctioning of his internal organs which should have been detected in the incipient stage by 
robot examiners. 

"Kill him," said Krisch, and 
walked on. 

The voice of the squad leader 
followed him. "Sir, I don't understand. Are we all going to have 
pain, like the lower animals?" 

Krisch did not answer. He 



stepped into the lift at the end of 
the corridor and dropped swiftly 
to the ground level. His speedster 
was waiting opposite the mouth of 
the exit tunnel. He climbed in, 
worked it through the tunnel, then 
pointed its nose at the sky and fed 
it power. 

FIVE thousand feet above the 
Unit's force screen and some 
distance away from its perimeter, 
he leveled off and hovered, scanning the surface below at high magnification. 
He waited. 

There it came now; a tiny, slim 
shape d.irting straight toward the 
Unit from the direction of Unit 
One. Viar must be furious, Krisch 
thought. He caught the shape on 
the screen of his computer and 
snapped the controls over to "intercept." 

Instantly, his craft nosed over 
and shot downward. He counted 
seconds automatically. At "three" 
the other speedster was nearly in 
the' center of his forward screen. 
At "four" it entered the field of 
the force cannon Krisch had installed in the nose of his ship. He 
pressed the trigger and flung the 
ship into a steep ascent. 

When he came out of the gray 
blackout, he saw the fragments of 
Viar's ship still spreading, whirling 
crazily under the stars. Below, an 
amorphous column of dust and 
debris was rising from the site of 
Unit Ten. The force screen was 



5 5 3 




 



down, and every structure above 
ground level had been destroyed. 

Krisch leveled off and turned on 
the scanner that was tuned to his 
cavern at the end of the tunnel. It 
responded immediately, showing 
him a view of the machine shop, 
with his nearly complete assembly 
standing in the middle of the room. 
Beyond were the transparent chambers in which the Pattern worked. 
Krisch saw that there were still 
three cadets waiting in the outer 
of these. It was enough. After an 
hour, there would be no more extraneous minds to ask the Pattern 
questions. 

Satisfied, he turned his ship toward Unit Two. It was just as well 
that Viar had managed to destroy 
Krisch's own Unit; it saved him 
the inconvenience of doing it himself. Neglected, the cadets had become not only distasteful, but a 
potential danger. 

He descended cautiously on Unit 
Two, jockeying the ship until its 
discharge valve was directly over 
the center of the force screen. 
Everywhere else, the screen was 
proof against any attack likely to 
be mounted by a spaceship, including radioactive dust; but here, at 
the node, it was vulnerable to a 
man who knew exactly what to do. 
Krisch tripped the release and let 
the deadly stuff filter down. 

He repeated the process at every 
remaining Unit, taking Viar's Unit 
last. He was reasonably certain that 
Viar had not waited to persuade 



any other Director to cooperate in 
the attack; if he had, that Director 
would find nothing to attack when 
he got there- — and no place to go 
when he got back. 

He returned to the shambles of 
Unit Ten, reconnoitered carefully 
to make sure that no other speedster was waiting within attacking 
range, then descended and tunneled 
through the debris until he struck 
the end of excavation. He left the 
speedster, opened the airtight door, 
one of a series that had closed 
when the tunnel lost air, and walked back to the cavern. 

THE incredibly complex structure 
which Krisch had built was no' 
the final stage; it was only the 
final fabricator. The final product 
would be Krisch himself. 

He experimented first with a 
tiny cylinder into which he had 
built an affinity device turned to a 
target plate at the opposite end of 
the chamber. He lined it up so 
that it would pass through the field 
of the Pattern's machine on its way 
to the target, and arranged a photoelectric cell to track it and register 
the exact moment when it disappeared. 

He released the cylinder. It 
streaked across the room, into the 
middle of the ten -fool framework 
of the machine — and abruptly 
sprouted from the target fifty feet 
away. 

Trembling, Krisch read the 
meters. There was not one micro


ASK ME ANYTHING 



151 



second's difference between the 
time the cylinder had passed 
through the field and the time it 
had appeared on the target plate. 
To the limit of his equipment's 
ability to record, the passage had 
been instantaneous. 

He examined the cylinder with 
sensitive instruments that had previously measured its dimensions, its 
weight and structure. The cylinder 
was unchanged, undistorted. 

Krisch grinned at the Pattern. 
There was danger in that enigmatic 
structure of forces, he knew, but 
he had escaped it by a strategy that 
was perfect because it was so simple. There were a million questions 
he had wanted to ask the Pattern; 
they tingled within him like an 
internal itch, but he had not asked 
one. He had asked only for the 
technical information he needed to 
build the transport device — he had 
not bothered to follow up any of 
the curious mathematical and 
philosophical implications of some 
of the steps involved. There was 
no time and he saw no need. 

He knew that his certainty of 
safety was not self-delusion: he had 
checked himself daily with the hypnotically given psych tests. He was 
sane- His self-confidence was up a 
few points; that was natural. His 
empathy rating was down about 
the same amount; that had never 
been high— if it had, he would 
never have been assigned to head 
the Project. Those were the only 
changes. His orientation was per


fect. There were no signs of any 
incipient neuroses or psychoses, including the one he had most feared : 
a guilt complex centered around his 
destruction of the cadets. 

He was able to think about that 
without remorse, now as ever. They 
had only been half-alive. They were 
better off in oblivion. 

HE LOOKED at the finished 
device once more. It was a 
hollow framework of curious, otitof-plumb angles. Over it and 
around it crawled a metal vine bearing odd fruits: metal roses, each 
petal mathematically aligned; lozenges of transparent metal, -each 
with a tiny, glowing heart. It 
looked like nothing so much as 
some alien being's notion of a work 
of art; but Krisch looked at it with 
awe and respect, remembering the 
labor each tiny part had cost him. 

Inside, in the field created by 
those metal blossoms, matter gained 
a new dimension — permanently. It 
was not like the half -efficient overdrive used in spaceships. That was 
an artificial condition, which collapsed when the power was withdrawn. 

Krisch had made a visual analogy 
to help himself understand the 
difference. He imagined normal 
space-time as a sphere of viscious 
fluid. A ship going into overdrive 
extended itself half out of that 
sphere, and tilted its molecules so 
that the rest offered less resistance 
to the liquid. But the Pattern's de


152 




 



vice extended the matter it affected 
like an accordion — open, half out 
of the stream; closed, all the way 
out. 

The matter so treated was not 
an uneasy visitor on the threshold 
of that abnormal space; it was at 
home there. And, once treated, it 
could be made to move from one 
space to the other at will. 

It was, Krisch thought, the difference between a flying lish and 
an amphibian. 

The test cylinder, though it now 
partook of the properties of both 
spaces, was useless for transport 
because it lacked control. It was 
set to home on the target plate 
where it now was. If you tried to 
move it away, the instant you succeeded by so much as the width of 
a molecule, the cylinder would return through hyperspace to its former position. The result, in gross 
terms, was that you simply could 
not budge it. 

It was an amusing toy, Krisch 
thought, and some use might later 
be f o un d for it. Targ et plates 
planted in enemy cities, for example, and radiating missiles. 

But the principal military use 
of the device was going to involve 
human control. The human passenger was the control. You snapped 
into hyperspace, you selected your 
target in normal spate, snapped 
through again, and you were there. 
In hyperspace there was a perceptible interval, long enough to choose; 
in normal space there was none. 



KRISCH checked his equipment 
once more. He had a sc-miportable field generator which 
projected a spherical force screen 
around him, and a reaction motor 
which could be used for short-range 
travel. The assembly was much too 
bulky and awkward to be of any 
use in military operations, but it 
was a necessary safeguard. If anything went wrong, Krisch did not 
propose to die for want of air in 
interplanetary space. Also, he meant 
to appear somewhat dramatically in 
the all but impregnable fortress 
that housed GHQ on Cynara. A 
startled staff officer might conceivably turn a weapon on him before 
he had a chance to explain. 

He considered setting a charge 
to destroy the Pattern's device after 
he had used it, and regretfully 
abandoned the idea. It would be 
good insurance against any reluctance to meet his terms, but the 
model itself was the only thing he 
had to sell. He had not drawn any 
plans as he worked; the plans were 
now in the Pattern's memory, and 
he had Saved time by working directly from the vivid images the 
Pattern had given him. 

Krisch turned off the power, 
stepped into the middle of the 
framework and stood with his hand 
on the control. There was nothing 
more to be done. He looked at the 
Pattern and thought, "Will you be 
here when I return?" 
"Yes." 

Good enough. The thing was not 



ASK ME ANYTHING 



153 



alive, not intelligent, and was therefore, obviously, incapable o£ boredom. Its drives took it restlessly 
from one questioning mind to another — when there were minds 
available. When there were none, 
it would wait. It had been built on 
this planet; evidently, no provision 
had ever been made for it to leave. 

It knew too much, and was intrinsically too dangerous, ever to 
be allowed to contact another 
mind. Krisch could not destroy it, 
but it would be here when he returned, and he could make sure 
that no one else would ever come 
to this world. 

Krisch thought to himself, "Cynara„ The spaceport outs ide Main 
Fortress. " He visualized it, h cl d 
the thought firmly in his mind.. He 
turned on the power. 

STUNNED, Krisch tried to 
orient himself, to figure out 
what was the matter. He lay weightless in a gray space, somehow above 
and yet somehow surrounded by a 
frightening, tangled infinity of 
gray spheres and white crisscrossing lines. Every thing lie saw was 
at the same time immensely distant 
and so close that he could almost 
touch it. The array changed and 
shifted bewilderingly, and he tried 
helplessly to follow it, read some 
sense into its motion, until he remembered: "Cynara. The .spaceport 
ouLside Main Fortress." 

There it was, below him, like 
some incredible four- dimensioned 



map, at his fingertips. He saw it 
clearly. He willed himself toward 
it, into it. But nothing happened. 

Time passed, time without 
measure. The tiny gray figures of 
men and machines did not move; 
time was suspended, for them, at 
the instant Krisch had entered the 
field. Krisch realized suddenly that 
he was hungry. Terrified, he looked 
at the dial of the airmaker at his 
waist. It was hard to read; the new 
dimension made vision queer and 
uncertain, but he made out at last 
that he had used mo're than three 
hours' supply. Time had not 
stopped for him. 

He thought desperately, "The 
Project planet. The cavern." 

Instantly, there was the cavern, 
the framework standing in the 
middle of the shop floor, and, 
nearby, the Pattern. An instant 
later, the Pattern vanished. 

A voice said in his mind, "Ask 
me anything." 

Krisch stared at it. Was there a 
mocking tone in that unaccented, 
polite mental voice ? He said 
hoarsely, aloud, "What went 
wrong?" 

"Nothing went wrong." 
Krisch mastered himself sufficiently to say evenly, "I was not 
able to enter normal space at my 
destination. Why not?" 

"You did not wait long enough. 
There is a great disparity between 
the time rates of this plenum and 
the normal one; that is why travel 
can be achieved at a rate which 



T54 




 



cm not be distinguished from simultaneity by your methods. In subjective terms, the trip to Cynara 
will take you a long time." 

"How long?" Krisch demanded. 
He felt helpless, fixed like a pinned 
Specimen in the midst of this gray 
infinity. v 

"Approximately one thousand of 
your years." 

Krisch felt his face writhe and 
distort into the silent shape of a 
scream. Blood pounded at his 
temples; his eyes filmed. He said, 
"How long back to the cavern?" 

"Only one year, if you were to 
start immediately to concentrate on 
the objective. If you allow yourself 
to drift, as you are doing now, the 
distance will widen rapidly." 

"But I've only got enough air 
for twenty hours!" Krisch shouted. 
"I'll die!" 

THERE was no response. 
Krisch pulled himself back 
from the borderline of hysteria. He 
suppressed his rage and fear and 
uncertainty. At least, whatever the 
reason, the Pattern was here to answer questions. He said, "What 
was your motive in lying to me?" 
"I did not lie to you," 
"You told me," Krisch said furiously, "that there was a negligible 
time interval between departure 
and arrival. Why?" 

"To me it is negligible." 
Krisch saw that it was true. It 
was his own fault for having 
phrased the question inadequately, 



for having refused to follow up 
all the implications of the science 
the Pattern had taught him. The 
Pattern, he remembered, was not 
alive, not intelligent, not capable 
of boredom. 

He remembered another line of 
questioning that he had not followed up, and thought he saw the 
vague shape of a terrifying possibility. 

He said, "When you first came 
to me, you described yourself as a 
device to amuse and entertain. Was 
that the whole truth?" 

"You did not ask the whole 
truth." 

"What is the whole truth?" 

The Pattern immediately began 
to recite the history of the race that 
had made it. Krisch realized venomously that he had asked too 
sweeping a question, and was 
about to rephrase it, but the significance of what the Pattern was 
saying stopped him. 

They had been entirely alien, 
those people; their psychology was 
incomprehensible to men. They did 
not fight; they did not explore; 
they did not rule or exploit; they 
had nothing that could be identified with human curiosity — that 
apelike trail that had made humanity what it was. Yet they had a 
great science. They had acquired it 
for some motive that Krisch could 
never grasp. 

They had, really, only two characteristics that would be recognizable to men : they loved each other, 



ASK ME ANYTHING 



155 



their homes, their world; and they 
had a deep, joyful, ironic sense of 
humor. 



fEN came," said the Pattern, 
"eleven million of your 
years ago. They wanted my makers' 
world and therefore they killed my 
makers. My makers knew anguish 
of flesh and spirit, but they could 
not fight. Aggressiveness, conflict, 
were inconceivable to them. But remember that they understood irony. 
Before the last of them died, they 
•made us as a gift to their destroyers. We were a good gift. We contain all that they knew. We are 
truthful. We are immortal. We are 
made to serve. 

"It is not our makers' fault," 
concluded the Pattern, "if men use 
the knowledge we give them to 
destroy themselves." 

There was only a thin shred 
left of Krisch's hold on his sanity. 
He said very carefully, "Did your 
makers foresee the situation I am 
in?" 
"Yes." 

"Is there any ivay for me to 
escape from it?" 

The Pattern said, "Yes. It is the 
final jest of my makers. To travel 
in hyperspace, you must become 
what I am only a pattern of forces 
and memory, not alive, not intelligent, not capable of boredom. I can 
make this alteration, if you request 



it. It is simple, like the growth of 
one crystal from another, or like 
the transfer of pattern in living 
cells." 

Krisch choked. He said, "Will I 
remember?" 

"You will have your own memories in addition to those I give 
you. But you will not retain your 
human character; you will not be 
aggressive, or cruel, or egotistic, or 
curious. You will be a device for 
answering questions." 

Krisch's mind revolted against 
the thought. But he looked at the 
dial of his airmaker, and knew 
what his answer would be. In a 
flash of prophetic insight, he knew 
what would happen thereafter. He 
would finish his journey to Cynara. 
He would tell the truth, and the 
truth would corrupt. 

Wherever there were m en , 
throughout the universe and to the 
end of time, his influence would 
f ollow them. Eventual ly, there 
would be other unwary seekers of 
knowledge who would take the 
path he had taken. 

By choosing this way out, he 
would inevitably become mankind's 
executioner. 

But when had men hesitated to 
risk the survival of the race for 
their own advantage? 
; "All right," Krisch said. "The 
pattern is clear."
