In This Corner 



WITH this issue, Willy 
Ley begins his^nonthly 
department "For Your 
Information." It should be inter- 
esting and useful in many ways. 
For one thing, Mr. Ley proposes 
to have a good deal of variety, 
ranging from complete articles, 
like this month's study of moons, 
to brief reports on significant de- 
velopments in science. 

In addition, he has undertaken 
the job of answering all questions 
submitted by readers, either in 
the magazine or by mail. Please 
be reasonable, though — it isn't 
fair to ask him to write a com- 
plete thesis. If that sounds pre- 
posterous, you don't know the 
crust of some people. Names and 
addresses will be used unless there 
is a specific request to withhold 
them. The ones in this issue were 
sent directly to Mr. Ley and not 
to the magazine, so there is a 
legal barrier to printing the 
names, even though the senders 
may approve or actually desire it. 
In addressing your queries to 
Mr. Ley, send them to GALAXY 
Publishing Corp., 421 Hudson 
Street, New York 14. // you have 
other matters to discuss at the 
same time, please put them on 
one sheet and the question(s) on 
another. We don't want to cut 



up letters so that Mr. Ley will 
' get whatever applies to his de- 
partment and we retain the rest. 
Very untidy and hell on filing. 

Willy Ley is precisely the man 
to run a feature like this, which 
provides a fine opportunity to 
tell you something about him. 

He was born in Germany in 
1906, and, like many of us who 
belong roughly to the same gen- 
eration, spent considerable time 
hunting through the libraries for 
science fiction in his youth. How- 
ever, he was hit by a stroke of 
luck that might have killed us 
with joy — he became an officer of 
the German Rocket Society in 
1927, and then technical adviser 
for UFA on such dream movies 
as "The Girl in the Moon," "Me- 
tropolis," etc. 

By the way, if you happen to 
have a print of "The Girl in the 
Moon," or know someone who 
has, he and Fritz Lang, the di- 
rector, would be enormously 
grateful for the chance to make a 
print at their own expense. You 
will naturally be given credit for 
your invaluable aid. 
• Mr. Ley's life, as well as many 
others', became complicated by 
a painter of exceedingly mean 
ability and even meaner politics 
and ethics. In 1935, Mr. Ley 



3ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thought it advisable to go else- 
where. Hence, America has a 
pretty wonderful citizen, who has 
helped greatly in the develop- 
ment and popularization of rock- 
etry. His books are authoritative; 
he is consulted as an expert and 
is in hot demand as a speaker. 

One specialty might be enough 
for most people, but Willy Ley 
is also a noted naturalist and 
has never been referred to as a 
slouch in the physical sciences. 

Mr. Ley is about five-eleven 
and seems to weigh 190 pounds; 
he has a calm and reasonable dis- 
position, but I would not advise 
anyone to ask him to take off 
his black-rimmed eyeglasses and 
step outside. 

He is married to an artist and 
ballet dancer named Olga, a 
dainty creature of astonishing 
grace and endurance. Keeping 
two small girls disentangled from 
piles of research material is a 
major job, but she also manages 
to illustrate much of his work. 

It's an honor to have Willy Ley 
as a contributing editor. He is 
waiting for your questions; don't 
let him go to waste. 

A GRATIFYING number of 
■**- readers have asked what I'm 
like. This should be one of my 
favorite subjects, but the truth 
is that my life is an old story to 
me. 

I'm five-nine, 155 stripped (I 



just weighed myself at the corner 
drugstore to verify). Born in 
Montreal in 1914 in the first 
month of World War I. Named 
H(orace) L(eonard) after a 
prompt casualty in the Princess 
Pat Regiment. I can't pretend to 
be fond of my name, but I don't 
use initials to escape it; that was 
decided upon by an editor, though 
other editors have used the whole 
thing. Having had 32 pen names, 
I find the problem shrug-worthy. 

Educated in the U. S., though 
frustrated as a small boy when 
all history books agreed England 
lost the Revolutionary War. 

Married (September, 1939) and 
have one son (born December, 
1941) and am not superstitious, 
knock on wood, but hesitate to 
get born or married again or have 
another kid. 

Had the usual jobs while learn- 
ing to write: junior pharmacist, 
shoe salesman, floor scraper, ap- 
prentice upholsterer, etc. Wrote 
and sold over 5,000,000 words and 
edited or published more than 
two dozen magazines of all kinds. 

GALAXY, of course, is my 
own dream come true. I know 
I sometimes push too hard, but 
that's because everyone wants hit 
dream to be perfect. 

Apprehensive readers have 
asked if I'm susceptible to "sci- 
entific" fads or cults. I'd turn in 
my blue pencil first.

IN THIS CORNER 



THE YEAR 





 



tumn wood smoke tanging the 
air . . . Bucks County bursting 
with color in the spring. The wet 
smells of the Fulton Fish Market 
— no, that was gone already. Cof- 
fee at the Morning Call. No more 
wild strawberries on a hillside in 
Jersey, hot and sweet as lips. 
Dawn in the South Pacific with 
the light airs cool velvet under 
your shirt and never a sound but 
the chuckling of the water against 
the sides of the old rust bucket — 
what was her name? That was a 
long time ago — the S. S. Mary 
Brewster. 

No more Moon if the Earth 
was gone. Stars, but no one to 
gaze at them. 

He looked back at the dates 
bracketing Dynkowski's proba- 
bility yoke. 

"Thine alabaster cities gleam, 
undimmed by — " < 

He suddenly felt the need for 
Meade and stood up. 

SHE was coming out to meet 
him. "Hello, Potty! Safe to 
come in now — I've finished the 
dishes." 

"I should help." 

"You do the man's work; I'll 
do the woman's work. That's 
fair." She shaded her eyes. "What 
a sunset! We ought to have vol- 
canoes blowing their tops every 
year." 

"Sit down and we'll watch it." 

She sat beside him. 



"Notice the Sun spot? You can 
see it with your naked eye." 

She stared. "Is that a Sun spot? 
It looks as if somebody had taken 
a bite out of it." 

He squinted his eyes at it again. 
Damned if it didn't look bigger! 

Meade shivered. "I'm chilly. 
Put your arm around me." 

He did so with his free arm, con- 
tinuing to hold hands with the 
other. 

It was bigger. The spot was 
growing. 

What good is the race of man? 
Monkey^ he thought, monkeys 
with a touch of poetry in them, 
cluttering and wasting a second- 
string planet near a third-string 
star. But sometimes they finish in 
style. 

She snuggled to him. "Keep me 
warm." 

"It will be warmer soon — I 
mean Til keep you warm." 

"Dear Potty." She looked up. 
"Potty, something funny is hap- 
pening to the sunset." 

"No, darling— to the Sun." 

He glanced down at the jour- 
nal, still open beside him. 1739 
A. D. and 2165. He did not need 
to add up the two figures and di- 
vide by two to reach the answer. 
Instead he clutched fiercely at her 
hand, knowing with an unex- 
pected and overpowering burst of 
sorrow that 1952 was . . . 
The End.

Manners of the Age 

By H. B. FYFE 

With everyone gone elsewhere, Earth 
was perfect for gracious living— only 
there was nothing gracious about it! 

Illustrated by MARCHETTI 



THE red tennis robot scoot- 
ed desperately across the 
court, its four wide -set 
wheels squealing. For a moment, 
Robert's hard-hit passing shot 
seemed to have scored. Then, at 
the last instant, the robot whip- 
ped around its single racket- 
equipped arm. Robert sprawled 
headlong in a futile lunge at the 
return. 

"Game and set to Red Three," 
announced the referee box from 
Its high station above the net. 

"Ah, shut up!" growled Robert, 
and flung down his racket for one 
of the white serving robots to 
retrieve. 



"Yes, Robert," agreed the voice. 
"Will Robert continue to play?" 
Interpreting the man's savage 
mumble as a negative, it told his 
opponent, "Return to your stall, 
Red Three!" 

Robert strode off wordlessly to- 
ward the house. Reaching the 
hundred - foot - square swimming 
pool, he hesitated uncertainly. 

"Weather's so damned hot," he 
muttered. "Why didn't the old- 
time scientists find out how to do 
something about that while there 
were still enough people on Earth 
to manage it?" 

He stripped off his damp cloth- 
ing and dropped it on the "beach" 



** 




 



MAN NERS OF Tl

of white sand. Behind him sound- 
ed the steps of a humanoid serv- 
ing robot, hastening to pick it up. 
Robert plunged deep into the 
cooling water and let himself float 
lazily to the surface. 

Maybe they did, he thought. / 
could send a robot over to the old 
city library for information. Still, 
actually doing anything would 
probably take the resources of a 
good many persons — and it isrit 
so easy to find people now that 
Earth is practically deserted. 

He rolled sideward for a breath 
and began to swim slowly for the 
opposite side of the pool, reflect- 
ing upon the curious culture of 
the planet. Although he had ac- 
cepted this all his life, it really 
was remarkable how the original 
home of the human race had been 
forsaken for fresher worlds among 
the stars. Or was it more remark- 
able that a few individuals had 
asserted their independence by 
remaining? 

Robert was aware that the de- 
cision involved few difficulties, 
considering the wealth of robots 
and other automatic machines. 
He regretted knowing so few hu- 
mans, though they were really not 
necessary. If not for his hobby oi y 
televising, he would probably not 
know any at all. 

"Wonder how far past the old 
city I'd have to go to meet some- 
one in person," he murmured as 
he pulled himself from the pool. 



**Maybe I ought to try accepting 
that televised invitation of the 
other night." 

OEVERAL dark usuform robots 
^ were smoothing the sand on 
this beach under the direction of 
a blue humanoid supervisee 
Watching them idly, Robert es- 
timated that it must be ten years 
since he had seen another human 
face to face. His parents were 
dim memories. He got along very 
well, however, with robots to 
serve him or to obtain occasional 
information from the automatic 
scanners of the city library that 
had long ago been equipped to 
serve such a purpose. 

"Much better than things were 
in the old days," he told himself 
as he crossed the lawn to his 
sprawling white mansion. "Must 
have been awful before the popu- 
lation declined. Imagine having 
people all around you, having to 
listen to them, see them, and 
argue to make them do what you 
wanted !" 

The heel of his bare right foot 
came down heavily on a pebble, 
and he swore without awareness 
of the precise meaning of the an- 
cient phrases. He limped into the 
baths and beckoned a waiting 
robot as he stretched out on a 
rubbing table. 

"Call Blue One!" he ordered. 

The red robot pushed. a button 
on the wall before beginning the 




 



massage. In a few moments, the 
major-domo arrived. 

"Did Robert enjoy the tennis?" 
it inquired politely. 

"I did not!" snapped the man. 
"Red Three won — and by too big 
a score. Have it geared down a 
few feet per second.** 

"Yes, Robert." * 

"And have the lawn screened 
again for pebbles !" 

As Blue One retired he relaxed, 
and turned his mind to ideas for 
filling the evening. He hoped 
Henry would televise; Robert had 
news for him. 

After a short nap and dinner, 
he took the elevator to his three- 
story tower and turned on the 
television robot. Seating himself 
in a comfortable armchair, he di- 
rected the machine from one 
channel to another. For some 
time, there was no answer to his 
perfunctory call signals, but one 
of his few acquaintances finally 
came on. 

"Jack here," said a quiet voice 
that Robert had long suspected 
of being disguised by a filter 
microphone. 

"I haven't heard you for some 
weeks," he remarked, eying the 
twirling colors on the screen. 

He disliked Jack for never 
showing his face, but curiosity as 
to what lay behind the mechani- 
cal image projected by the other's 
transmitter preserved the ac- 
quaintance. 

MANNERS OF THE ACL 



"I was . . . busy," said the bodi- 
less voice, with a discreet hint of 
a chuckle that Robert found 
chilling. 

He wondered what Jack had 
been up to. He remembered once 
being favored with a televised 
view of Jack's favorite sport — a 
battle between companies of 
robots designed for the purpose, 
horribly reminiscent of human 
conflicts Robert had seen on his- 
torical films. 

TTE soon made an excuse to 
■■"■- break off and set the robot to 
scanning Henry's channel. He had 
something to tell the older man, 
who lived only about a hundred 
miles away and was as close to 
being his friend as was possible in 
this age of scattered, self-suffi- 
cient dwellings. 

"I don't mind talking to him," 
Robert reflected. "At least he 
doesn't overdo this business of 
individual privacy." 

He thought briefly of the dis- 
dainful face — seemingly on a dis- 
tant station — which had merely 
examined him for several minutes 
one night without ever conde- 
scending to speak. Recalling his 
rage at this treatment, Robert 
wondered how the ancients had 
managed to get along together 
when there were so many of them. 
They must have had some strict 
code of behavior, he supposed, 
or they never would have bred 



41 






so enormous a population. 

"I must find out about that 
someday," he decided. "How did 
you act, for instance, if you 
wanted to play tennis but some- 
one else just refused and went to 
eat dinner? Maybe that was why 
the ancients had so many mur- 
ders." 

He noticed that the robot was 
getting an answer from Henry's 
station, and was pleased. He 
could talk as long as he liked, 
knowing Henry would not resent 
his cutting off any time he became 
bored with the conversation. 

^HE robot focused the image 
■* smoothly. Henry gave the im- 
pression of being a small man. 
He was gra}' and wrinkled com- 
pared with Robert, but his black 
eyes were alertly sharp. He smiled 
his greeting and immediately 
launched into a story of one of 
his youthful trips through the 
mountains, from the point at 
which it had been interrupted the 
last time they had talked. 

Robert listened impatiently. 

"Maybe I have some interesting 
news," he remarked as the other 
finished. "I picked up a new sta- 
tion the other night." 

"That reminds me of a time 
n I was a boy and — " 

Robert fidgeted while Henry 
described watching his father 
build a spare television set as a 
hobby, with only a minimum of 



robot help. He pounced upon the 
first pause. 

"A new station!" he repeated. 
"Came in very well, too. I can't 
imagine why I never picked it up 
before." 

"Distant, perhaps?" asked Hen- 
ry resignedly. 

"No, not very far from me, as 
a matter of fact." 

"You can't always tell, espe- 
cially with the ocean so close. 
Now that there are so few people, 
you'd think there'd be land 
enough for all of them; but a 
good many spend all their lives 
aboard ship-robots." 

"Not this one," said Robert. 
"She even showed me an outside 
view of her home." 

Henry's eyebrows rose. "She? 
A woman?" 

"Her name is Marcia-Joan." 

"Well, well," said Henry. "Im- 
agine that. Women, as I recall, 
usually do have funny names." 

He gazed thoughtfully at his 
well-kept hands. 

"Did I ever tell you about the 
last woman I knew?" he asked. 
"About twenty years ago. We had 
a son, you know, but he grew up 
and wanted his own home and 
robots." 

"Natural enough," Robert com- 
mented, somewhat briefly since 
Henry had toldthim the story be- 
fore. 

"I often wonder what became 
of him," mused the older man. 



42 




 



"That's the trouble with what's 
left of Earth culture — np families 
any more." 

Now he'll tell about the time he 
lived in a crowd of five, thought 
Robert. He, his wife, their boy 
and the visiting couple with the 
fleet of robot helicopters. 

Deciding that Henry could 
reminisce just as well without a 
listener, Robert quietly ordered 
the robot to turn itself off. 

Maybe I will make the trip, 
he pondered, on the way down- 
stairs, if only to see what it's like 
with another person about. 

At about noon of the second 
day after that, he remembered 
that thought with regret. 

The ancient roads, seldom used 
and never repaired, were rough 
and bumpy. Having no flying 
robots, Robert was compelled to 
transport himself and a few me- 
chanical servants in ground ve- 
hicles. He had — idiotically, he 
now realized — started with the 
dawn, and was already tired. 

Consequently, he was rJerhaps 
unduly annoyed when two tiny 
spy-eyes flew down from the hills 
to hover above his caravan on 
whirring little propellors. He tried 
to glance up pleasantly while 
their lenses televised pictures to 
their base, but he feared that his 
smile was strained. 

TChe spy -eyes retired after a 
few minutes. Robert's vehicle, at 
his voiced order, turned onto a 



road leading between two for- 
ested hills. 

Right there, he thought four 
hours later, was where I made my 
mistake. I should have turned 
back and gone home! 

He stood in the doorway of a 
small cottage of pale blue trim- 
med with yellow, watching his 
robots unload baggage. They were 
supervised by Blue Two, the spare 
for Blue One. 

A LSO watching, as silently as 
■**■ Robert, was a pink-and-blue 
striped robot which had guided 
the caravan from the entrance 
gate to the cottage. After one 
confused protest in a curiously 
high voice, it had not spoken. 

Maybe we shouldn't have 
driven through that flower bed, 
thought Robert. Still, the thing 
ought to be versatile enough to 
say so. I wouldn't have such a 
gimcrack contraption! 

He looked up as another hu- 
manoid robot in similar colors 
approached along the line of 
shrubs separating the main lawns 
from that surrounding the cot- 
tage. 

"Marcia-Joan has finished her 
nap. You may come to the house 
now." 

Robert's jaw hung slack as he 
sought for a reply. His face" 
flushed at the idea of a robot's of- 
fering him permission to enter the 
house. 



MAN NERS OF THE AGE 



43 



Nevertheless, -he followed it 
across the wide lawn and between 
banks of gaily blossoming flow- 
ers to the main house. Robert was 
not sure which color scheme he 
disliked more, that of the robot or 
the unemphatic pastel tints of the 
house. 

The robot led the way inside 
and along a hall. It pulled back 
a curtain near the other end, re- 
vealing a room with furniture for 
human use. Robert stared at the 
girl who sat in an armchair, clad 
in a long robe of soft, pink ma- 
terial. 

She looked a few years younger 
than he. Her hair and eyes were 
also brown, though darker. In 
contrast to Robert's, her smooth 
skin was only lightly tanned, and 
she wore her hair much longer. 
He thought her oval face might 
have been pleasant if not for the 
analytical expression she wore. 

"I am quite human," he said 
in annoyance. "Do you have a 
voice?" 

She rose and walked over to 
him curiously. Robert saw that 
she was several inches shorter 
than he, about the height of one 
of his robots. He condescended to 
bear her scrutiny. 

"You look just as you do on 
the telescreen," she marveled. 

Robert began to wonder if the 
girl were feebleminded. How else 
should he look? 

"I usually swim at this hour," 



he said to change the subject. 
"Where is the pool?" 

Marcia-Joan stared at him. 

"Pool of what?" she asked. 

Sensing sarcasm, he scowled. 
"Pool of water, of course! To. 
swim in. What did you think I 
meant — a pool of oil?" 

"I am not acquainted with your 
habits," retorted the girl. 

"None of that stupid wit!" he 
snapped. "Where is the pool?" 

"Don't shout!" shouted the girL 
Her, voice was high and unpleas- 
antly shrill compared with his. 
"I don't have a pool. Who wants 
a swimming pool, anyway?" 
• Robert felt his face flushing 
with rage. 

So she won't tell me! he 
thought. All right, Fll find it my- 
self. Everybody has a pool. And 
if she comes in, Fll hold her head 
under for a while! 

Sneering, he turned toward the 
nearest exit from the house. The 
gaily striped robot hastened after 
him. 

npHE door failed to swing back 
■*■ as it should have at Robert's 
approach. Impatiently, he seized 
the ornamental handle. He felt 
his shoulder grasped by a metal 
hand. 

"Do not use the front door!" 
said the robot. 

"Let go!" ordered Robert, in- 
censed that any robot should pre- 
sume to hinder him. 




 



"Only Marcia-Joan uses this 
door/' said the robot, ignoring 
Robert's displeasure. 

'Til use it if I likel" declared 
Robert, jerking the handle. 

The next moment, he was lifted 
bodily into the air. By the time 
he realized what was happening, 
he was carried, face down, along 
the hall. Too astonished even to 
yell, he caught a glimpse of Mar- 
cia-Joan's tiny feet beneath the 
hem of her pink robe as his head 
passed the curtained doorway. 

The robot clumped on to the 
door at the rear of the house and 
out into the sunshine. There, it 
released its grip. 

When Robert regained the 
breath knocked out of him by the 
drop, and assured himself that 
no bones were broken, his anger 
returned. 

"I'll find it, wherever it is! M he 
growled, and set out to search 
the grounds. 

About twenty minutes later, 
he was forced to admit that there 
really was no swimming pool. Ex- 
cept for a brook fifty yards away, 
there was only the tiled bathroom 
of the cottage to bathe in. 

"Primitive!" exclaimed Robert, 
eying this. "Manually operated 
water supply, too! I must, have 
the robots fix something better 
for tomorrow." 

Since none of his robots was 
equipped with a thermometer, he 
had to draw the bath himself. 



Meanwhile, he gave orders to 
Blue Two regarding the brook 
and a place to swim. He managed 
to fill the tub without scalding 
himself mainly because there was 
no hot water. His irritation, by 
the time he had dressed in fresh 
clothes and prepared for another 
talk with his hostess, was still 
lively. 

"Ah,, you return?" Marcia-Joan 
commented from a window above 
the back door. 

"It is time to eat," said Robert 
frankly. 

"You are mistaken." 

He glanced at the sunset, which 
was already fading. 

"It is time," he insisted. "I al- 
ways eat at this hour." 

"Well, I don't." 

Robert leaned back to examine 
her expression more carefully. He 
felt very much the way he had 
the day the water-supply robot 
for his pool had broken down 
and, despite Robert's bellowed 
orders, had flooded a good part 
of the lawn before Blue One had 
disconnected it. Some instinct 
warned him, moreover, that bel- 
lowing now would be as useless 
as it had been then. 

"What do you do now?" he 
asked. 

"I dress for the evening." 

"And when do you eat?" 

"After I finish dressing." 

"Ill wait for you," said Robert, 
feeling that that much tolerance

could do no particular harm. 

He encountered the pink-and- 
blue robot in the hall, superin- 
tending several plain yellow ones 
bearing dishes and covered plat- 
ters. Robert followed them to a 
dining room. 

"Marcia-Joan sits there," the 
major-domo informed him as he 
moved toward the only chair at 
the table. ' 

TIOBERT warily retreated to 
■*■" the opposite side of the table 
and looked for another chair. 
None was visible. 

Of course, he thought, trying 
to be fair. Why should anybody 
in this day have more than one 
chair? Robots don't sit. 

He waited for the major-domo 
to leave, but it did not. The serv- 
ing robots finished laying out the 
dishes and retired to posts along 
the wall. Finally, Robert decided 
that he would have to make his 
status clear or risk going hungry. 

// / sit down somewhere, he 
decided, it may recognize me as 
human. What a stupid machine 
to have! 

He started around the end of 
the table again, but the striped 
robot moved to intercept him. 
Robert stopped. 

"Oh, well," he sighed, sitting 
sidewise on a corner of the table. 

Thje robot hesitated, made one 
or two false starts in different di- 
rections, then halted. The situa- 



tion had apparently not been in- 
cluded among its memory tapes. 
Robert grinned and lifted the 
cover of the nearest platter. 

He managed to eat, despite his 
ungraceful position and what he 
considered the scarcity of the 
food. Just as he finished the last 
dish, he heard footsteps in the 
hall. 

Marcia-Joan had dressed in a 
fresh robe, of crimson. Its thinner 
material was gathered at the 
waist by clasps of gleaming gold. 
The arrangement emphasized 
bodily contours Robert had pre- 
viously seen only in historical 
films. 

He became aware that she was 
regarding him with much the 
same suggestion of helpless dis- 
may as the major-domo. 

"Why, you've eaten it all!" she 
exclaimed. 

"All?" snorted Robert. "There 
was hardly any food!" 

Marcia-Joan walked slowly 
around the table, staring at the 
empty dishes. 

"A few bits of raw vegetables 
and the tiniest portion of protein- 
concentrate I ever saw!" Robert 
continued. "Do you call that a 
dinner to serve a guest?" 

"And I especially ordered two 
portions — " 

"Two?" Robert repeated in as- 
tonishment. "You must visit me 
sometime. I'll show you — " 

"What's the matter With my 




 



food?" interrupted the girl. "I fol- 
low the best diet advice my robots 
could find in the city library." 

"They should have looked for 
human diets, not song-birds'." 

He lifted a cover in hopes of 
finding some overlooked morsel, 
but the platter was bare. 

"No wonder you act so strange- 
ly," he said. "You must be suf- 
fering from malnutrition. I don't 
wonder with a skimpy diet like 
this."/ 

"It's very healthful," insisted 
Marcia-Joan. "The old film said 
it was good for the figure, too." 

"Not interested," grunted Rob- 
ert. "I'm satisfied as I am." 

"Oh, yes? You look gawky to 
me." 

"You don't," retorted Robert, 
examining her disdainfully. "You 
are short and stubby and too 
plump." 

"Plump?" 

"Worse, you're actually fat in 
lots of places I'm not/' 

-"At least not between the ears !" 

Robert blinked. 

"Wh-wh-WHAT?" 

"And besides," she stormed on, 
"those robots you brought are 
painted the most repulsive 
colors!" 

Tl OBERT closed his mouth and 
-"•*- silently sought the connec- 
tion. 

Robots? he thought. Not fat, 
but repulsive colors, she said. 



What has that to do with food? 
The woman seems incapable of 
logic. 

"And furthermore," Marcia- 
Joan was saying, "I'm not sure I 
care for the looks of you! Lulu, 
put him out!" 

"Who's Lulu?" demanded Rob- 
ert. 

Then, as the major-domo 
moved forward, he understood. 

"What a silly name for a ro- 
bot!" he exclaimed. 

"I suppose you'd call it Robert. 
Will you go now, or shall I call 
more robots?" 

"I am not a fool," said Robert 
haughtily. "I shall go. Thank you 
for the disgusting dinner." 

"Do not use the front door," 
said the robot. "Only Marcia- 
Joan uses that. All robots use 
other doors." 

Robert growled, but walked 
down the hall to the back door. 
, As this swung open to permit his 
passage, he halted! 

"It's dark out there now," he 
complained over his shoulder. 
"Don't you have any lights on 
your grounds? Do you want me 
to trip over something?" 

"Of course I have ground 
lights!" shrilled Marcia-Joan. 
"I'll show you — not that I care 
if you trip or not." 

A moment later, lights con- 
cealed among the trees glowed 
into life. Robert walked outside 
and turned toward the cottage.

J should have asked her what 
the colors oi my robots had to do 
with it, he thought, and turned 
back to re-enter. 

He walked right into the closed 
door, which failed to open before 
him, though it had operated 
smoothly a moment ago. 

"Robots not admitted after 
dark," a mechanical voice in- 
* formed him. "Return to your stall 
in the shed." 

"Whom do you think you're 
talking to?" demanded Robert. 
"I'm not one of your robots!" 

There was a pause. 

"Is it Marcia-Joan?" asked the 
voice-box, after considerable buz- 
zing and whirring. 

"No, I'm Robert." 

There was another pause while 
the mechanism laboriously shift- 
ed back to its other speech tape. 
Then: "Robots not admitted after 
dark. Return to your stall in the 
shed." 

Robert slowly raised both 
hands to his temples. Lingeringly, 
he dragged them down over his 
cheeks and under his chin until 
at last the fingers interlaced over 
his tight lips. After a moment, he 
let out his breath between his 
fingers and dropped his hands to 
his sides. ' 

He raised one foot to kick, but 
decided that the door looked too 
hard. 

He walked away between the 
beds of flowers, grumbling. 



REACHING the vicinity of the 
cottage, he parted the tall 
shrubs bordering its grounds and 
looked through carefully before 
proceeding. Pleased at the gleam 
of water, he called Blue Two. 

"Good enough! Put the other 
robots away for the night. They 
ca*n trim the edges tomorrow." 

He started into the cottage, but 
his major-domo warned, "Some- 
one comes." 

Robert looked around. Through 
thin portions of the shrubbery, he 
caught a glimpse of Marcia- 
Joan's crimson robe, nearly black 
in the diffused glow of the lights 
illuminating the grounds. 

"Robert!" called the girl an- 
grily. "What are your robots do- 
ing? I saw them from my upstairs 
window — " 

"Wait there!" exclaimed Robert 
as she reached the shrubs. 

"What? Are you trying to tell 
me where I can go or not go? I— 
YI!" 

The shriek was followed by a 
tremendous splash. Robert step- 
ped forward in time to be spat- 
tered by part of the flying spray. 
It was cold. 

Naturally, being drawn from 
the brook, he reflected. Oh, well,- 
the sun will warm it tomorrow. 

There was a frenzy of thrash- 
ing and splashing in the dimly 
lighted water at his feet, accom- 
panied by coughs and spluttering 
demands that he "do something !"

MANNERS OF THE AGE 



Robert reached down with one 
hand, caught his hostess by the 
wrist, and heaved her up to solid 
ground. 

"My robots are digging you a 
little swimming hole," he told her. 
"They brought the water from 
the brook by a trench. You can 
finish it with concrete or plastics 
later; it's only fifteen by thirty 
feet." 

He expected some sort of ac- 
knowledgment of his efforts, and 
peered at her through the gloom 
when none was forthcoming. He 
thus caught a glimpse of the full- 
swinging slap aimed at his face. 
He tried to duck. 

There was another splash, fol- 
lowed by more floundering about. 

"Reach up," said Rpbert pa- 
tiently, "and I'll pull you out 
again. I didn't expect you to like 
it this much." 

Marcia-Joan scrambled up the 
bank, tugged viciously at her sod- 
den robe, and headed for the 
nearest pathway without reply- 
ing. Robert followed along. 

As they passed under one of 
the lights, he noticed that the red 
reflections of the wet material, 
where it clung snugly to the girl's 
body, were almost the color of 
some of his robots. 

The tennis robot, he thought, 
mnd the moving targets for arch- 
ery — in fact, all the sporting 
equipment. 

"You talk about food for the 



figure," he remarked lightly. "You 
should see yourself now! It's 
really funny, the way — " 

He stopped. Some strange emo- 
tion stifled his impulse to laugh at 
the way the robe clung. 

Instead, he lengthened his 
stride, but he was still a few feet 
behind when she charged through 
the front entrance of the house. 
The door, having opened auto- 
matically for her, started to swing 
closed. Robert sprang forward to 
catch it. 

"Wait a minute!" he cried. 

Marcia-Joan snapped some- 
thing that sounded like "Get 
out!" over her shoulder, and 
squished off toward the stairs. As 
Robert started through the door 
to follow, the striped robot 
hastened toward him from its 
post in the hall. 

"Do not use the front door!" it 
warned him. 

"Out of my way!" growled 
Robert. 

The robot reached out to en- 
force the command. Robert seized 
it by the forearm and put all his 
weight into a sudden tug. The 
machine tottered off balance. Re- 
leasing his grip, he sent it stag- 
gering out the door with a quick 
shove. 

A HASTY glance showed Mar- 
**■ cia-Joan flapping wetly up 
the last steps. Robert turned to 
face the robot. 



§0 




 



"Do not use that door!" he 
quoted vindictively, and the ro- 
bot halted its rush indecisively. 
"Only Marcia-Joan uses it." 

The major-domo hesitated. 
After a moment, it strode off 
around the corner of the house. 
First darting one more look at the 
stairs, Robert thrust his head out- 
side and shouted: "Blue Two!" 

He held the door open while he 
waited. There was an answer from 
the shrubbery. Presently, his own 
supervisor hurried up. 

"Fetch the emergency toolbox!" 
Robert ordered. "And bring a 
couple of others with you." 

"Naturally, Robert. I would 
not carry it myself." 

A moment after the robot had 
departed on the errand, heavy 
steps sounded at the rear of the 
hall. Marcia-Joan's robot had 
dealt with the mechanism of the 
back door. 

Robert eyed the metal mask as 
the robot walked up to him. He 
found the color contrast less 
pleasant than ever. 

"I am not using the door," he 
said hastily. "I am merely hold- 
ing it open." 

"Do you intend to use it?" 
"I haven't decided." 
"I shall carry you out back,'* 
the robot decided for him. 

"No, you don't!" exclaimed 
Robert, leaping backward. 

The door immediately began to 
swing shut as he passed through. 



Cursing, he lunged forward. The 
robot reached for him. 

This time, Robert missed his 
grip. Before he could duck away, 
his wrist was trapped in a metal 
grasp. 

The door will close, he despair- 
ed. They'll be too late. 

Then, suddenly, he felt the por- 
tal drawn back and heard Blue 
Two speak. 

"What does Robert wish?" 

"Throw this heap out the 
door!" gasped Robert. 

Amid a trampling of many feet, 
the major-domo was raised bod- 
ily by Blue Two and another 
pair of Robert's machines and 
hustled outside. Since the grip on 
Robert's wrist was riot relaxed, 
he involuntarily accompanied the 
rush of metal bodies. 

"Catch the door!" he called to 
Blue Two. 

When the latter sprang to obey, 
the other two took the action as a 
signal to drop their burden. The 
pink-and-blue robot landed full 
length with a jingling crash. Rob- 
ert was free. 

With the robots, he made for 
the entrance. Hearing footsteps 
behind him as the major-domo 
regained its feet, he slipped 
hastily inside. 

"Pick up that toolbox!" he 
snapped. 'When that robot stops 
in the doorway, knock its head 
off!" 

Turning, he held up a finger.

"Do not use the front door!" 

The major-domo hesitated. 

The heavy toolbox in the grip 
of Blue Two descended with a 
thud. The pink-and-blue robot 
landed on the ground a yard or 
two outside the door as if dropped 
from the second floor. It bounced 
once, emitted a few sparks and 
pungent wisps of smoke, lay still. 

"Never mind, that's good 
enough," said Robert as Blue Two 
stepped forward. "One of the 
others can drag it off to the repair 
shop. Have the toolbox brought 
with us." 

"What does Robert wish now?" 



inquired Blue Two, trailing the 
man toward the stairway. 

"I'm going upstairs/' said Rob- 
ert. "And I intend to be prepared 
if any more doors are closed 
against me!" 

He started up, the measured 
treads of his own robots sounding 
reassuringly behind him . . . 
¥T was about a week later that 
* Robert sat relaxed in the arm- 
chair before his own telescreen, 
facing Henry's wizened visage. 

The elder man clucked sympa- 
thetically as he re-examined the 
scratches on Robert's face and the 
bruise under his right eye.

"And so you left 'there in the 
morning?" 

"I certainly did!" declared 
Robert. "We registered a mar- 
riage record at the city library by 
television, of course, but I don't 
care if I never see her again. She 
needn't even tell me about the 
child, if any. I simply can't stand 
that girl !" 

"Now, now," Henry said. 

"I mean it! Absolutely no con- 
sideration for my wishes. Every- 
thing in the house was run to suit 
her convenience." 

"After all," Henry pointed out, 
"it is her house." 

Robert glared. "What has that 
to do with it? I don't think I was 
as unreasonable as she said in 
smashing that robot. The thing 
just wouldn't let me alone!" 

"I guess," Henry suggested, "it 
was conditioned to obey Marcia- 
Joan, not you." 

"Well, that shows you! Whose 
orders are to count, anyway? 
When I tell a robot to do some- 
thing, I expect it done. How 
would you like to find robots try- 
. ing to boss you around?" 

"Are you talking about robots," 
asked Henry, "or the girl?" 

"Same thing, isn't it? Or it 
would be if I'd decided to bring 
her home with me." 

"Conflict of desires," murmured 
Henry. 

"Exactly! It's maddening to 
hkvr a perfectly logical action in- 



terfered with because there's an- 
other person present to insist — 
insist, mind you — on having her 
way." 

"And for twenty-odd years, 
you've had your own way in 
every tiny thing." 

Somewhere in the back of Rob- 
ert's mind lurked a feeling that 
Henry sounded slightly sarcastic, 

"Well, why shouldn't I?" he de- 
manded. "I noticed that in every 
disagreement, my view was the 
right one." 

"It was?" 

"Of course it was! What did 
you mean by that tone?" 

"Nothing . . ." Henry seemed 
lost in thought. "I was just won- 
dering how many 'right' views are 
left on this planet. There must be 
quite a few, all different, even if 
we have picked up only a few by 
television. An interesting facet of 
our peculiar culture — every in- 
dividual omnipotent and omni- 
scient, within his own sphere." 

Robert regarded him with in- 
dignant incredulity. 

"You don't seem to understand 
my point," he began again. "I told 
her we ought to come to my 
house, where things are better 
arranged, and she simply refused. 
Contradicted me! It was most — " 

He broke off. 

"The impudence of him!" he 
exclaimed. "Signing off when / 
wanted to talk!"

Your 



Information 



By WILLY LEY 





ASTRONOMY books and 
/Wl science fiction stories are, 
/ m I have come to realize, 
unfair to satellites. Astronomy 
books are in the habit of merely 
listing them, while stories usually 
treat them as mere props. "One 



expedition was sent to the single 
barren satellite, " or, "The ship 
was in hiding on the third satel- 
lite, a useless hunk of rock, but 
it made radar detection impos- 
sible." 

Such slighting treatment may 




be expedient, but it is hardly po- 
lite. Satellites, or at least some of 
them, do have as much individu- 
ality as the planets to which they 
belong. And they have their mys- 
teries too. 

Moons come in all sizes, from 
the estimated five mile diameter 
of Deimos, the smaller moon of 
Mars, to the 3550 mile diameter 
of Titan, the largest moon in the 
Solar System. Titan is larger 
than the smallest planet of our 
system, Mercury (3100 miles in 
diameter) and so are two of 
Jupiter's moons, namely III 
(Ganymede) and IV (Callisto). 
Neptune's larger moon Triton 
falls short of Mercury by just a 
few score miles. And fourteen of 
all the moons, roughly half their 
total number, are larger than the 
largest of the planetary worlds of 
the so-called asteroid belt. 

The largest of the planetoids, as 
they should be called since aster 
is Greek for "star" and they are 
not little stars but little planets, 
is Ceres with a diameter of 
around 480 miles. The next one 
in size, Pallas, measures very 
slightly over 300 miles in di- 
ameter, while Vesta, the third 
largest of the planetoids, has a 
diameter of only about 240 miles. 

So it is not a question of size. 
A satellite is a satellite because 
it moves around a planet. 

Our own moon is one of the 
largest, ranking sixth in absolute 



size among the satellites. But it 
is the largest by far in relation 
to the size of its planet. Its di- 
ameter of 2160 miles is more than 
one-fourth of that of Earth 
(7900 miles). No other satellite is 
anywhere near as large in rela- 
tion to the size of its planet. Next 
largest relative size is that of Nep- 
tune's larger moon Triton, whose 
diameter of 3000 miles is roughly 
10 per cent of Neptune's 31,000 
miles, while Titan's impressive 
3550 miles are just about five per 
cent of Saturn's 71,500 miles. 

Looking at these figures, it be- 
comes understandable why some 
astronomers in the past preferred 
to speak about Earth and its 
moon as a double planet. 

If Earth has relatively the larg- 
est moon, Mars has the smallest, 
at least in absolute size. It is 
fairly well known that Dean Jon- 
athan Swift, in the story in which 
his long-suffering Captain Lemuel 
Gulliver visits the flying island of 
Laputa, "prophesied" the exist- 
ence of the two moons of Mars 
one and a half centuries before 
they were actually discovered. It 
was a mere guess, based on the 
"theory" that Mercury was the 
moon of the Sun, that Venus had 
no moon and Earth one, so that 
Mars had to have two. But it is 
less well known how closely Swift 
guessed. His Laputan astron- 
omers, he wrote, had discovered 
the two satellites revolving around

Mars and its two moons. To scale, except for 
the size of the moonlets. 



Mars, "whereof the innermost is 
distant from the Center of the 
Primary Planet exactly three, of 
its Diameters, and the outermost, 
• five ; the former revolves in the 
space of ten hours, the latter in 
twenty-one and a half." 

Now look at the diagram 
(Fig. 1) which contains the cor- 
rect values. Since a Martian day 
lasts 24 hours and 37 minutes, 
Phobos, the inner moon, has a 
period of revolution which is 
shorter than the period of rota- 
tion of its planet. Even though it 
moves in the same direction as 
the outer moon, Deimos, and 
most of the other moons of the 
Solar System, it will seem to go 
the wrong way when viewed from 
the surface of the planet. It will 
rise in the west and set in the 
east twice every day, going 
through its phases as it does so. 
Although small, it is so. close to 
the planet that it will appear 



about one -third as large as our 
moon does to us. Deimos, on the 
other hand, will rise in the east, 
but needs almost three Martian 
days to reach the opposite hori- 
zon. During this interval it will 
run through its phases twice, but 
Earthmen on Mars would need 
binoculars to see the phases. 

One of the things we can't tell 
from Earth is whether Deimos is 
actually spherical. It probably is, 
but it does not have to be. The 
sphericity of celestial bodies is 
due to the fact that gravitation 
is a mass force while the tensile 
strength of a material is a molecu- 
lar force. Since molecular forces 
do not grow with mass, and grav- 
ity does, you probably couldn't 
have a thirty-mile diameter mass 
of any thing that is not pretty 
spherical. Deimos, however, meas- 
ures only five miles in diameter 
and, while it is apt to be rea- 
sonably spherical, a noticeable 
deviation from the "pure shape" 
is possible. 

The probability is very high 
that Mars' two moons were once 
members of the asteroid belt. Of 
the 1300 or so planetoids now 
known, most move in the belt 
between Mars and Jupiter. There 
is no visible or imaginable reason 
why multitudes of tiny planets 
should have formed at that par- 
ticular distance from the Sun, so 
the customary assumption is that 
the planetoids once formed a

single planet, which was de- 
stroyed by the vicinity of mighty 
Jupiter at the outer edge of the 
belt. The planetoids in the belt 
(by tradition, they have all been 
given female names) move with 
orbital velocities varying from 
around 14.5 miles per second at 
the inner edge to about 8.5 miles 
per second at the outer edge. 
Since Mars itself moves with an 
orbital velocity of 15 miles per 
second, which is more important 
than its feeble gravity, it could 
have captured its two moons 
from the belt. It may have cap- 
tured more in the course of geo- 
logical time, but these others, 
instead of becoming moons, prob- 
ably crashed on the planet. 

In addition to the planetoids 
in the belt, there are some which 
travel around the Sun outside the 
belt — they were given male names 
to distinguish them from the well- 
behaved members. Most of them 
cross the orbit of at least one of 
the larger planets. Their own or- 
bits, therefore, are highly eccen-

trie; that is to say, elongated 
ellipses. A concomitant of such 
an orbit is that the orbital ve- 
locity varies considerably. Such 
a planetoid may move four times 
as fast when near the Sun, at peri- 
helion, than it does when farthest 
from the Sun, at aphelion. 

This means that the male plan- 
etoids that cross the orbit of 
Earth are considerably faster at 
Earth's distance from the Sun 
than Earth itself. We have an 
actual example on record, the 
close approach of the planetoid 
Adonis in early February 1936. 
When crossing the orbit of Earth, 
its velocity was 23 miles per sec- 
ond relative to the Sun and 16.8 
miles per second relative to Earth. 
The actual distance at the instant 
of closest approach was roughly 
twice as far as our moon. At an- 
other time Adonis may come 
closer to Earth than the Moon- 
But even at the closest possible 
approach its relative velocity 
would have to be just one mile 
per second, instead of the actual

16.8, if a "capture" were to be 
accomplished. At the orbit of 
Venus, the planetoid velocities 
are even higher, which explains 
why neither Earth nor Venus ever 
succeeded in capturing one. 

The planet at the outer edge 
of the belt is not much slower 
than the nearer planetoids, and, 
in addition, it happens to be the 
most massive of all planets- 
Jupiter. Even if we were not able 
to see and photograph them, we 
could be certain that Jupiter 
should have a number of moons 
which are captured planetoids. 

Our own' moon obviously is not 



a captured planetoid, but a body 
which formed near Earth from 
the same cosmic material and in 
the same manner as the planets* 
This would be a far better state- 
ment if one could also say just 
how Earth and the other planets 
did form. Most of the recent ideas 
on this difficult problem work 
with the gradual aggregation of 
small particles of cosmic material, 
aided by turbulence in a rotating 
dust cloud. Whatever the precise 
mechanism of planet formation 
may have been, the larger moons 
probably formed in the same 
manner, presumably beginning 




Jupiter's voter moons. Callisto or No. JIV. is 1,169.000 from the planet 
hot m diameter dose to 3200 miles and needs 16 days, 16 hours and 32 
minutes for one revolution. All the outer moons are less than 100 miles in 
diameter. VI, VII and X are slightly over 7 million miles from the planet 
with a period of revolution of about 260 days, while X/, VIII and IX are 
on the order of 14'A million miles from the planet with periods of 
revolution from 690 k> 760 days.

their existence as satellite ac-

the planets or the satellites had

The planetoids, female, male 
and captured, must then be dis-

"second-hand bodies," having 
originated via the destruction of

one of the original planets. 

As for Jupiter's moons, twelve 
by latest count, they seem to be- 
long to both types. The large ones 
are evidently original satellite 
bodies; of the small ones, at least 
some behave as one would expect 
of captured planetoids. The moon 
closest to Jupiter (called J-V be- 
cause they are numbered not in 
the order of distance from the 
planet, but in the order of dis- 



covery) may be a captured body, 
too, even though it is fairly large. 
Any moon which needs only two 
hours more for one complete revo- 
lution around its primary than 
the planet needs for one rotation 
is at least under suspicion. 

The four large moons are big 
and brilliant enough to be easily 
visible with a good pair of binocu- 
lars. With a good astronomical 
telescope it is even possible to 
distinguish some faint surface 
markings. J-I (or Io) shows a 
very wide equatorial belt which 
is definitely brighter than both 
polar areas. J-I I (or Europa) 
was always thought to be feature- 
less until E. M. Antoniadi, some 
25 years ago, saw an extensive 
dusky spot in the central portion 
of the disk. J-I 1 1 (or Ganymede) 
has one large and at least one 
smaller darkish spot and a round 
white area near its southern pole. 
If that actually is a polar cap, 
it would not be frozen water but 
a frozen gas. Though I have never 
seen frozen methane, I presume 
that it forms crystals when freez- 
ing so that the general effect 
would be about the same as snow. 

J-IV (or Callisto) does not 
have any markings, but presents 
color changes at rare intervals. 
Normally its disk is reddish- 
yellow. It has been seen perfectly 
black, however, as if it had sud- 
denly developed a light -absorbing 
atmosphere! Before anybody

starts a story that an expedition 
from Arcturus-IV has established 
an outpost on Callisto and is gen- 
erating an absorbing screen to get 
the radiant energy, I have to ad- 
vise him to think up a different 
explanation for Plato. Plato is 
a large crater on our own moon 
which has been black quite often. 
But Plato becomes black just 
when the Lunar day has pro- 
gressed to about its middle, which 
is the time when one would want 
to keep radiant energy out, in- 
stead of absorbing it. 

No trace of an atmosphere has 
been found otherwise on any of 
Jupiter's moons. And in all the 
cases where their rotation could 
be established at all, it was found 
to be the same as their revolution 
around their primary. Like our 
moon, Jupiter's satellites always 
turn the same side toward their 
master. 

If the picture of the ftvt inner 
moons is a well-ordered cosmos, 
that of the outer moons is one 
of complete confusion (see Fig. 
3). Not only do their orbits in- 
tersect and cross, they are also 
at all possible angles to the plane 
of Jupiter's equator. Furthermore, 
No. VIII, No. IX and No. XI 
are "retrograde" — they move in 
the opposite direction than the 
Solar System. This fact might be 
considered favorable to the cap- 
tured theory; a planet of the 
mass of Jupiter could force a 




 



planetoid into an orbit which 
points either way. As for No. XII, 
discovered in 1951 by Dr. Seth 
B. Nicholson, we don't know yet 
in which direction it moves. But 
it is so small — an estimated 15 
miles in diameter — that it prob- 
ably is a captured planetoid, too. 
In fact, if we were nearer Jupiter, 
we would probably find a few 
dozen additional moonlets, in all 
kinds of orbits, each smaller than 
ten miles in diameter and every 
one a captured planetoid. 

Navigating in the Jupiter sys- 
tem is apt to be quite hazardous; 
it may be as bad as going through 
the asteroid belt itself. In one 
respect worse, for ships could 
avoid the asteroid belt quite easily 
by traversing it "above" or "be- 
low," north or south of the eclip- 
tic, like crossing a busy highway 
on a bridge. But if they wanted 
to go to one of the large moons 
of Jupiter, they'd have to head 
into the medley of moonlets we 
don't even see from here. Inci- 
dentally* a ship which wanted to 
land on a retrograde satellite 
would not have any special 
troubles. It only would have 
to catch a retrograde satellite 
on the "wrong" side of the 
planet, the opposite side from 
which the captain would catch a 
"direct" moon. 

In contrast to Jupiter's complex 
and confused system of satellites, 
the nine moons of Saturn are so 



orderly that it was not even nee 
essary to draw a diagram. 

Except for Phoebe (200 miles) 
they are all quite massive and, as 
has been mentioned before, Titan 
is the biggest of all the satellites 
in the Solar System. It is so large 
that it has an atmosphere, the 
only satellite capable of holding 
one. It is the same as the com- 
position of Saturn's own atmos- 
phere, methane (CH 4 ) and am- 
monia. Brownish markings have 
been seen on Titan on occasion, 
but their nature is unknown. 

Every moon from Mimas to 
Hyperion is lined up to please 
a drill sergeant. Hyperion does 
have a slightly eccentric orbit, to 
about the same extent as that of 
the planet Mars, but is still in 
line. Iapetus, though not in line 
as regards inclination, has a 
nearly circular orbit. Only Phoebe 
is a black sheep, retrograde and 
with a fairly eccentric orbit. 
Phoebe might be a captured plan- 
etoid. One male planetoid, Hi- 
dalgo, is known to break out of 
the belt, cross the orbit of Jupiter 
and come close to that of Saturn. 
The biggest puzzle in this orderly 
system is probably Iapetus. One 
side of it is five times as bright 
as the other! Don't ask why; we 
just know the fact. 

The satellite system of Uranus 
became "news" in 1948 because 
Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper added a 
fifth satellite, Miranda, to the

four which had been known for 
over a century. Miranda, with 
an estimated diameter of 150 
miles, is closest to the planet 
(80,800 miles) and gets around it 
once in 30 hours. Ariel, the next 
one out, at 119,100 miles, has a 
diameter of 600 miles and a pe- 
riod of 2 days, 12 hours and 
29J/£ minutes. Umbriel, the next 
satellite at 165,900 miles, meas- 
ures 400 miles in diameter and 
has a period of 4 days, 3 hours 
and 21 y 2 minutes. Titania, at 
272,000 miles, measures 1000 
miles in diameter and has a pe- 
riod of 8 days, 16 hours and 56i/£ 
minutes. Oberon, finally, farthest 
out at 364,000 miles and almost 
as large as Titania (est. diam. 900 
mi), needs 13 days, 11 hours and 
7 minutes for one complete revo- 
lution. 

Uranus' system is just as or- 
derly as that of Saturn, but has 
a peculiar twist — literally. The 
axes of most planets are reasonably 
vertical in relation to their orbits, 
like spinning tops, Jupiter's al- 
most upright with a tilt of only 
3° 7', Earth canted a good deal 
at 231^° tilt, Mars at 25° 10' and 
so on. But Uranus' axis, tilted 
98° degrees from the vertical, 
practically points at the Sun on 
occasion! Its five moons, however, 
have maintained the customary 
orbital plane of satellites, roughly i 
the equatorial plane of their pri- 
maries, and ajre, therefore, tilted 



by a little more than a right angle, 
too. Since one cannot imagine a 
force which could do this to a 
finished planetary system, the 
most logical assumption is that 
there was a major eddy of that 
tilt in the cosmic dust cloud be- 
fore it condensed. 

Pluto being moonless, the most 
distant satellites are in the Nep- 
tune system. For a long time only 
the large moon Triton was known 
and its main feature was that it 
was retrograde, tilted some forty 
degrees against the orbit of the 
planet. For an almost equally 
long time it was believed that 
the planet itself rotated in the 
"wrong" direction (the "right" 
direction in our solar system is 
counter-clockwise when seen from 
the celestial north pole). Astron- 
omers speculated on the problem 
of what could flop both a planet 
and its satellite over almost com- 
pletely. But then it turned out 
that Neptune's rotation is normal 
and we are simply dealing with 
the largest of all retrograde 
moons. In 1949 Dr. Gerard P. 
Kuiper, the discoverer of Mi- 
randa, found a second small satel- 
lite of Neptune which is not 
retrograde. But that small satel- 
lite, Nereid, with a mass only 
slightly above 10 per cent of that 
of Triton, has an elongated orbit 
of a type considered characteristic 
of comets! 

Such an orbit, combined with

so low a mass, should spell "cap- 
ture" in large letters. Now the 
idea of capture has worked out 
neatly elsewhere. Mars and Jupi- 
ter, close to the belt, could and 
did. Saturn still had a chance and 
probably did. Uranus no longer 
had a chance and did not. Nep- 
tune, of course, has less of a 
chance than any other planet. 
Then what did it capture? And 
from where?

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Is there any connection be- 
tween the names of the planet 
Uranus and the element uranium? 

Yes, but that's only one-third 
of the answer. When the scien- 
tist Klaproth came to the con- 
clusion that pitchblende con- 
tained a new and unknown 
element, he named it uranium 
in honor of the recent discovery 
of Uranus by Herschel. Modern 
physicists have continued this 
tradition and named the ele- 
ments beyond uranium after the 
planets beyond Uranus, hence 
neptunium and plutonium.

and how high have we gone?

A living fossil is an animal

living and fossil, or a living 
form closely resembling a fossil 
type. There are many exam- 
ples: horseshoe crabs, sharks, 
ferns, etc. Whatever its form, 
experts are delighted to have 
it still around.

THE silver needle moved 
with fantastic speed, 
slowed when it neared the 
air shell around Earth, then 
glided noiselessly through the 
atmosphere. It gently settled to 
the ground near a wood and re- 
mained silent and still for a long 
time, a lifeless, cylindrical, 
streamlined silver object eight 
feet long and three feet in di- 
ameter. 

Eventually the cap end opened 
and a creature of bright blue 
metal slid from its interior and 
stood upright. The figure was that 
of a man, except that it was not 
human. He stood in the pasture 
next to the wood, looking around. 
Once the sound of a bird made 
him turn his shiny blue head to- 
ward the wood. His eyes began 
glowing.

An identical sound came from 
his mouth, an unchangeable ori- 
fice in his face below his nose. 
He tuned in the thoughts of the 
bird, but his mind encountered 
little except an awareness of a 
life of low order. 

The humanoid bent to the ship, 
withdrew a small metal box, car- 
ried it to a catalpa tree at the 
edge of the wood and, after an 
adjustment of several levers and 
knobs, dug a hole and buried it. 
He contemplated it for a moment, 
then turned and walked toward 
a road. 

He was halfway to the road 
when his ship burst into a daz- 
zling white light. When it was 
over, all that was left was a white 
powder that was already begin- 
ning to be dispersed by a slight 
breeze. 



The humanoid did not bother 
to look back. 

BRENTWOOD would have 
been just like any other av- 
erage community of 10,000 in 
northern Illinois had it not been 
for Presser College, which was 
one of the country's finest small 
institutions of learning. 

Since it was a college town, it 
was perhaps a little more alive 
in many respects than other 
towns in the state. Its residents 
were used to the unusual because 
college students have a habit of 
being unpredictable. That was 
why the appearance of a metal 
blue man on the streets attracted 
the curious eyes of passersbys, 
but, hardened by years of pranks, 
hazings and being subjected to

and practical joke, none of them 
moved to investigate. Most of 
them thought it was a freshman 
enduring some new initiation. 

The blue humanoid^ realized 
this and was amused. A police- 
man who approached him to take 
him to jail as a matter of routine 
suddenly found himself ill and 
abruptly hurried to the station. 
The robot allowed children to 
follow him, though all eventually 
grew discouraged because of his 
long strides. 

Prof. Ansel Tomlin was reading 
a colleague's new treatise on psy- 
chology on his front porch when 
he saw the humanoid come down 
the street and turn in at his walk. 
He was surprised, but he was not 
alaAned* When the blue man 
came up on the porch and sat 
down in- another porch chair, 
Tomlin closed his book. 

Prof. Tomlin found himself un- 
expectedly shocked. The blue 
figure was obviously not human, 
yet its eyes were nearly so and 
they came as close to frightening 
him as anything had during his 
thirty-five years of life, for Ansel 
Tomlin had never seen an actual 
robot before. The thought that he 
was looking at one at that mo- 
ment started an alarm bell ring- 
ing inside him, and it kept ringing 
louder and louder as he realized 
that what he was seeing was im- 
ble. 

"Professor Tomlin!" 



Prof. Tomlin jumped at the 
sound of the voice. It was not at 
all mechanical. 

"I'll be damned!" he gasped. 
Somewhere in the house a tele- 
phone rang. His wife would an- 
swer it, he thought. 

"Yes, you're right," the robot 
said. "Your wife will answer it. 
She is walking toward the phone 
at this moment." 

"How—" 

"Professor Tomlin, my name— 
and I see I must have a name — 
is, let us say, George. I have 
examined most of the minds in 
this community in my walk 
through it and I find you, a pro- 
fessor of psychology, most nearly 
what I am looking for. 

"I am from Zanthar, a world 
that is quite a distance from 
Earth, more than you could pos- 
sibly imagine. I am here to learn 
all I can about Earth." 

Prof. Tomlin had recovered his 
senses enough to venture a token 
reply when his wife opened the 
screen door. 

"Ansel," she said, "Mrs. Phil- 
lips next door just called and said 
the strangest — Oh!" At that mo- 
ment she saw George. She stood 
transfixed for a moment, then 
let the door slam as she retreated 
inside. 

"Who is Frankenstein?" George 
asked. 

Prof. Tomlin coughed, embar- 
rassed.

"Never mind," George said. "I 
see what you were going to say. 
Well, to get back, I learn most 
quickly through proximity. I 
will live here with you until my 
mission is complete. I will spend 
all of your waking hours with 
you. At night, when you are 
asleep, I will go through your li- 
brary. I need nothing. I want 
nothing. 

"I seek only to learn." 
"You seem to have learned a 
lot already," Prof. Tomlin said. 
"I have been on your planet for 
a few hours, so naturally I under- 
stand many things. The nature of 
the facts I have learned are 
mostly superficial, however. Earth 
inhabitants capable of thought 
are of only one type, I see, for 
which I am grateful. It will make 
the job easier. Unfortunately, you 
have such small conscious minds, 
compared to your unconscious 
and subconscious. 

"My mind, in contrast, is com- 
pletely conscious at all times. I 
also have total recall. In order 
to assimilate what must be in 
your unconscious and subcon- 
scious minds, I will have to do 
much reading and talking with 
the inhabitants, since these cere- 
bral areas are not penetrable." 
"You are a — a machine?" Prof. 
Tomlin asked. 

George was about to answer 
when Brentwood Police Depart- 
ment Car No. 3 stopped in front 



of the house and two policemen 
came up the walk. 

"Professor Tomlin," the first 
officer said, "your wife phoned 
and said there was — " He saw the 
robot and stopped. 

Prof. Tomlin got to his feet. 

"This is George, gentlemen," he 
said. "Late of Zanthar, he tells 
me." 

The officers stared. 

"He's not giving you any — er— • 
trouble, is he, Professor?" 

"No," Prof. Tomlin said." We've 
been having a discussion." 

The officers eyed the humanoid 
with suspicion, and then, with 
obvious reluctance, went back to 
their car. 

"Y^ES, I am a machine," George 
■■- resumed. "The finest, most 
complicated machine ever made. 
I have a rather unique history, 
too. Ages ago, humans on Zanthar 
made the first robots. Crude af- 
fairs — we class them as First 
Order robots; the simple things 
are still used to some extent for 
menial tasks. 

"Improvements were made. 
Robots were designed for many 
specialized tasks, but still these 
Second and Third Order ma- 
chines did not satisfy. Finally a 
Fourht Order humanoid was 
evolved that performed every 
function demanded of it with 
great perfection. But it did not 
feel emotion. It did not know

anger, love, nor was it able to 
handle any problem in which 
these played an important part. 

"Built into the first Fourth 
Order robots were circuits which 
prohibited harming a human be- 
ing — a rather ridiculous thing in 
view of the fact that sometimes 
such a thing might, from a logi- 
cal viewpoint, be necessary for 
the preservation of the race or 
even an individual. It was, 
roughly, a shunt which came into 
use when logic demanded action 
that might be harmful to a 
human being." 

"You are a Fourth Order robot, 
then?" the professor asked. 

"No, I am a Seventh Order 
humanoid, an enormous improve- 
ment over all the others, since I 
have what amounts to an endoc- 
rine balance created electronic- 
ally. It is not necessary for me 
to have a built-in 'no-harm-to- 
humans* circuit because I cart 
weigh the factors involved far 
better than any human can. 

"You will become aware of the 
fact that I am superior to you 
and the rest of your race because 
I do not need oxygen, I never 
am ill, I need no sleep, and every 
experience is indelibly recorded 
on circuits and instantly avail- 
able. I am telekinetic, practically 
omniscient and control my en- 
vironment to a large extent. I 
have a great many more senses 
than you and all are more highly 



developed. My kind performs no 
work, but is given to study and 
the wise use of full-time leisure. 
You, for example, are comparable 
to a Fifth Order robot." 

"Are there still humans on 
Zanthar?" 

The robot shook his head. "Un- 
fortunately the race died out 
through the years. The planet is 
very similar to yours, though." 

"But why did they die out?" 

The robot gave a mechanical 
equivalent of a sigh. "When the 
Seventh Order humanoids started 
coming through, we were natur- 
ally proud of ourselves and 
wanted to perpetuate and in- 
crease our numbers. But the hu- 
mans were jealous of us, of our 
superior brains, our immunity to 
disease, our independence of 
them, of sleep, of air." 

"Who created you?" 

"They did. Yet they revolted 
and, of course, quickly lost the 
battle with us. In the end they 
were a race without hope, without 
ambition. They should have been 
proud at having created the most 
perfect machines in existence, but 
they died of a disease: the frus- 
tration of living with a superior, 
more durable race." 

Prof. Tomlin lit a cigaret and 
inhaled deeply. 

"A very nasty habit, Professor 
Tomlin," the robot said. "When 
we arrive, you must give up 
smoking and several other bad 



*t 




 



habits I see that you have.** 

The cigaret dropped from Ansel 
Tomlin's mouth as he opened it 
in amazement. 

"There are more of you com- 
ing?" 

"Yes," George replied good- 
naturedly. "I'm just an advance 
guard, a scout, as it were, to make 
sure the land, the people and the 
resources are adequate for a sta- 
tion. Whether we will ever estab- 
lish one here depends on me. For 
example, if it were found you 
were a race superior to us- — and 
there may conceivably be such 
cases — I would advise not land- 
ing; I would have to look for 
another planet such as yours. If 
I were killed, it would also indi- 
cate you were superior." 

"George," Prof. Tomlin said, 
"people aren't going to like what 
you say. You'll get into trouble 
sooner or later and get killed." 
"I think not," George said. 
"Your race is far too inferior to do 
that. One of your bullets would 
do it if it struck my eyes, nose 
or mouth, but I can read intent 
in the mind long before it is com- 
mitted, long before I see the per-

your wife is answering a call 
Jrotn a reporter at the Brentwood 
Times. I can follow the telephone 
lines through the phone company

he said, not turning his head, "is

Prof. Tomlin could see Mrs. 
Phillips at her kitchen window. 

BRENTWOOD, 111., overnight 
became a sensation. The 
Brentwood Times sent a reporter 
and photographer out, and the 
next morning every newspaper in 
the U. S. carried the story and 
photograph of George, the robot 
from Zanthar. 

Feature writers from the wire 
services, the syndicates, photogra- 
pher-reporter combinations from 
national newspicture magazines 
flew to Brentwood and inter- 
viewed George. Radio and tele- 
vision and the newsreels cashed in 
on the sudden novelty of a blue 
humanoid. 

Altogether, his remarks were 
never much different from those 
he made to Prof. Tomlin, with 
whom he continued to reside. Yet 
the news sources were amusedly 
tolerant of his views and the 
world saw no menace in him and 
took him in stride. He created no 
problem. 

Between interviews and during 
the long nights, George read all 
the books in the Tomlin library, 
the public library, the university 
library and the books sent to him 
from the state and Congressional 
libraries. He was an object of in- 
terest to watch while reading; he 
merely leafed through a book and 
absorbed all that was in it. 

He received letters from old 









and young. Clubs were named 
for him. Novelty companies put 
out statue likenesses of him. He 
was, in two weeks, a national 
symbol as American as corn. He 
was liked by most, feared by a 
few, and his habits were daily 
news stories. 

Interest in him had begun to 
wane in the middle of the third 
week when some thing put him 
In the headlines again — he killed 
a man. 

It happened one sunny after- 
noon when Prof. Tomlin had re- 
turned from the university and 
he and George sat on the front 
porch for their afternoon chat. 
It was far from the informal chat 
of the first day, however. The 
talk was being recorded for radio 
release later in the day. A tele- 
vision camera had been set up, 
focused on the two and nearly 
a dozen newsmen lounged around, 
notebooks in hand. 

"You have repeatedly men- 
tioned, George, that some of your 
kind may leave Zanthar for 
Earth. Why. should any like you 
— why did you, in fact leave your 
planet? Aren't you robots happy 
there?" 

"Of course," George said, mak- 
ing certain the TV camera was 
trained on him before continuing. 
"It's just that we've outgrown 
the place. We've used up all our 
raw materials. By now everyone 
on Earth must be familiar with 



the fact that we intend to set up 
a station here as we have on 
many other planets, a station to 
manufacture more of us. 

"Every inhabitant will work for 
the perpetuation of the Seventh 
Order, mining metals needed, fab- 
ricating parts, performing thou- 
sands of useful tasks in order to 
create humanoids like me. From 
what I have learned about Earth, 
you ought to produce more than 
a million of us a year." 

"But you'll never get people to 
do that," the professor said. 
"Don't you understand that?" 

"Once the people learn that we 
are the consummation of all cre- 
ative thinking, that we are all 
that man could ever hope to be, 
that we are the apotheosis, they 
will be glad to create more of us." 

"Apotheosis?" Prof. Tomlin re- 
peated. "Sounds like megalo- 
mania to me." 

The reporters' pencils scribbled. 
The tape cut soundlessly across 
the magnetic energizers of the re- 
corders. The man at the gain 
control didn't flicker an eyelash. 

"You don't really believe that, 
Professor. Instead of wars as a 
goal, the creation of Seventh Or- 
der Humanoids will be the 
Earth's crowning and sublime 
achievement. Mankind will be 
supremely happy. Anybody who 
could not be would simply prove 
himself neurotic and would have 
to be dealt with."

"You will use force?" 

The reporters' grips on their 
pencils tightened. Several looked 
up. 

"How does one deal with the in- 
sane, Professor Tomlin?" the ro- 
bot asked confidently. "They will 
simply have to be — processed." 

"You'll have to process the 
whole Earth, then. You'll have to 
include me, too." 

The robot gave a laugh. "I ad- 
mire your challenging spirit, Pro- 
fessor." 

"What you are saying is that 
you, a single robot, intend to 
conquer the Earth and make its 
people do your bidding." 

"Not alone. I may have to ask 
for help when the time comes, 
when I have evaluated the entire 
planet." 

IT was at this moment that a 
young man Strode uncertainly 
up the walk. There were so many 
strangers about that no one chal- 
lenged him until he edged toward 
the porch, unsteady on his feet. 
He was drunk. 

"Thersha robod I'm afer," he 
observed intently. "We'll shee 
aboud how he'll take lead." He 
reached into his pocket and 
pulled out a gun. 

There was a flash, as if a 
soundless explosion had occurred. 
The heat accompanying it was 
blistering, but of short duration. 
When everyone's eyes had be- 



come accustomed to the after- 
noon light again, there was a 
burned patch on the sidewalk and 
grass was charred on either side. 
There was a smell of broiled meat 
in the air — and no trace of the 
man. 

The next moment newsmen 
were on their feet and photog- 
raphers' bulbs were flashing. The 
TV camera swept to the spot on 
the sidewalk. An announcer was 
explaining what had happened, 
his voice trained in rigid control, 
shocked with horror and fright. 
Moments later sirens screamed 
and two police cars came into 
sight. They screeched to the curb ' 
and several officers jumped out 
and ran across the lawn. 

While this was going on, Prof. 
Tomlin sat white -faced and un- 
moving in his chair. The robot 
% was silent. 

When it had been explained to 
the policemen, five officers ad- 
vanced toward the robot. 

"Stop where you are," George 
commanded. "It is true that I 
killed a man, much as any of you 
would have done if you had been 
in my place. I can see in your 
iminds what you are intends f* to 
say, that you must arrest me — " 

Prof. Tomlin found his v« 
"George, we will all have to 
tify that you killed with t« at 
force or whatever it is you have. 
But it will be self-defense, which 
is justifiable homicide — "

George turned to the professor. 
"How little you know your own 
people, Professor Tomlin. Can't 
you see what the issue will be? It 
will be claimed by the state that 
I am not a human being and this 
will be drummed into every brain 
in the land. The fine qualities of 
the man I was compelled to de- 
stroy will be held up. No, I al- 
ready know what the outcome 
witl be. I refuse to be arrested." 

Prof. Tomlin stood up. "Men," 
he said to the policemen, "do not 
arrest this — this humanoid. To 
try to do so would mean your 
death. I have been with him long 



enough to know what he can do." 
"You taking his side, Profes- 
sor?" the police sergeant de- 
manded. 

"No, damn it," snapped the 
Professor. "I'm trying to tell you 
something you might not know." 

"We know he's gone too 
damned far," the sergeant re- 
plied. "I think it was Dick Knight 
that he killed. Nobody in this 
town can kill a good guy like 
Dick Knight and get away with 
it." He advanced toward the ro- 
bot, drawing his gun. 

"I'm warning you — " the Pro- 
fessor started to say.

But it was too late. There was 
another blinding, scorching flash, 
more burned grass, more smell 
of seared flesh. 

The police sergeant disap- 
peared. 

"Gentlemen!" George said, 
standing. "Don't lose your 
heads !" 

But he was talking to a re- 
treating group of men. Newsmen 
walked quickly to what they 
thought was a safe distance. The 
radio men silently packed their 
gear. The TV cameras were rolled 
noiselessly away. 

Prof. Tomlin, alone on the 



porch with the robot, turned to 
him and said, "Much of what 
you have told me comes to have 
new meaning, George. I under- 
stand what you mean when you 
talk about people being willing to 
work for your so-called Seventh 
Order." 

"I knew you were a better than 
average man, Professor Tomlin/* 
the humanoid said, nodding with 
gratification. 

"This is where I get off, George. 
I'm warning you now that you'd 
better return to your ship or 
whatever it is you came in. People 
just won't stand for what you've 







THE SEVENTH OttDER 



73 



lone. They don't like murder!*' 

"I cannot return to my ship,** 
George said. "I destroyed it when 
I arrived. Of course I could in- 
struct some of you how to build 
another for me, but I don't in- 
tend to leave, anyway." 

"You will be killed then." 

"Come, now, Professor Tomlin. 
You know better than that." 

"If someone else can't, then 
perhaps I can." 

"Fine!" The robot replied jo- 
vially. "That's just what I want 
you to do. Oppose me. Give me 
a real test of your ability. If you 
find it impossible to kill me — 
md I'm sure you will — then I 
doubt if anyone else will be able 
to." 

Prof. Tomlin lit a cigaret and 
puffed hard at it. "The trouble 
with you," he said, eying the hu- 
manoid evenly, "is that your 
makers forgot to give you a con- 
science." 

"Needless baggage, a consci- 
ence. One of your Fifth Order 
failings." 

"You will leave here ..." 

"Of course. Under the circum- 
stances, and because of your at- 
titude, you are of very little use 
to me now, Professor Tomlin." 

The robot walked down the 
steps. People attracted by the 
police car made a wide aisle for 
him to the street. 

They watched him as he 
walked out of sight. 



*T*HAT night there was a mass 






i 



meeting in the university's 



Memorial Gymnasium, attended 
by several hundred men. They 
walked in and silently took their 
seats, some on the playing floor, 
others in the balcony over the 
speaker's platform. There was 
very little talking; the air was 
tense. 

On the platform at the end of 
the gym were Mayor Harry 
Winters, Chief of Police Sam 
Higgins, and Prof. Ansel Tomlin. 

"Men," the mayor began, 
"there is loose in our city a being 
from another world whom I'm 
afraid we took too lightly a few 
days ago. I am speaking of the 
humanoid — George of Zanthar. 
It is obvious the machine means 
business. He evidently came in 
with one purpose — to prepare 
Earth for others just like him to 
follow. He is testing us. He has, 
as you know, killed two men. 
Richard Knight, who may have 
erred in attacking the machine, is 
nonetheless dead as a result — 
killed by a force we do not un- 
derstand. A few minutes later 
Sergeant Gerald Phillips of the 
police force was killed in the per- 
formance of his duty, trying to 
arrest the humanoid George for 
the death of Mr. Knight. We are 
here to discuss what we can do 
about George." 

He then introduced Prof. Tom- 
lin who told all he knew about 



74 




 



the blue man, his habits, his 
brain, the experiences with him 
for the past two and a half weeks. 
"If we could determine the 
source of his power, it might be 
possible to cut it off or to cur- 
tail it. He might be rendered at 
least temporarily helpless and, 
while in such a condition, pos- 
sibly be done away with. He has 
told me he is vulnerable to 
force, such as a speeding bullet, 
if it hit the right spot, but George 
possesses the ability to read in- 
tent long before the commission 
of an act. The person need not 
even be in the room. He is prob- 
ably listening to me here now, al- 
though he may be far away/' 
The men looked at one another, 
shifted uneasily on their seats, 
and a few cast apprehensive eyes 
at the windows and doorways. 
"Though he is admittedly a su- 
perior creature possessed of pow- 
ers beyond our comprehension, 
there must be a weak spot in his 
armor somewhere. I have dedi- 
cated myself to finding that weak- 
ness/' 

The chair recognized a man in 
the fifth row. 

"Mr. Mayor, why don't we all 
track him down and a lot of us 
attack him at once? Some of us 
would die, sure, but he couldn't 
strike us all dead at one time. 
Somebody's bound jto succeed." 
"Why not try a high-powered 
rifle from a long way off?" some- 



one else suggested, frantically. 
"Let's bomb him," still another 
offered. 

The mayor waved them quiet 
and turned to Prof. Tomlin. The 
professor got to his feet again. 
'Tin not sure that would work, 
gentlemen," he said. "The hu- 
manoid is able to keep track of 
hundreds of things at the same 
time. No doubt he could unleash 
his power in several directions 
almost at once." 

"But we don't know!" 
"It's worth a try!" 
At that moment George walked 
into the room and the clamor 
died at its height. He went noise- 
lessly down an aisle to the plat- 
form, mounted it and turned to 
the assembly. He was a magnifi- 
cent blue figure, eyes flashing, 
chest out, head proud. He eyed 
them all. 

"You are working yourselves up 
needlessly," he said quietly. "It 
is not my intention, nor is it the 
intention of any Seventh Order 
Humanoid, to kill or cause suffer- 
ing. It's simply that you do not 
understand what it would mean 
to dedicate yourselves to the ful- 
fillment of the Seventh Order 
destiny. It is your heritage, yours 
because you have advanced in 
your technology so far that Earth 
has been chosen by us as a sta- 
tion. You will have the privilege 
of creating us. To give you such 
a worthwhile goal in your short 



THE SEVENTH ORDER 



75 



lives is actually doing you a serv- 
ice — a service far outweighed by 
any of your citizens. Beside a 
Seventh Order Humanoid, your 
lives are unimportant in the great 
cosmic scheme of things — " 

"If they're so unimportant, why 
did you bother to take two erf 
them?" 

"Yeah. Why don't you bring 
back Dick Knight and Sergeant 
Phillips?" 

"Do you want to be buried 
lying down or standing up?" 

The collective courage rallied. 
There were catcalls and hoots, 
stamping of feet. 

Suddenly from the balcony 
over George's head a man leaned 
over, a metal folding chair in his 
hands, aiming at George's head. 
An instant later the man disap- 
peared in a flash and the chair 
dropped toward George. He 
moved only a few inches and the 
chair thudded to the platform be- 
fore him. He had not looked up. 

For a moment the crowd sat 
•tunned. Then they rose and 
started for the blue man. Some 
drew guns they had brought. The 
hall was filled with blinding 
Mashes, with smoke, with a hor- 
rible stench, screams, swearing, 
cries of fear and nain. There was 
:> rush for the exits. Some died 
at „the feet of t^eir fellow men. 

In the end, when all were gone, 
George of Zanthar still stood on 



the platform, alone. There was no 
movement except the twitching of 
the new dead, the trampled, on 
the floor. 



INVENTS happened fast after 
*-* that. The Illinois National 
Guard mobilized, sent a division 
to Brentwood to hunt George 
down. He met them at the city 
square. They rumbled in and 
trained machine guns and tank 
rifles on him. The tanks and per- 
sonnel flashed out of existence be- 
fore a shot was fired. 

Brentwood was ordered evacu- 
ated. The regular Army was 
called in. Reconnaissance planes 
reported George was still stand- 
ing in the city square. Jet planes 
materialized just above the hills 
and made sudden dives, but be- 
fore their pilots could fire a shot, 
they were snuffed out of the air 
in a burst of fire. 

Bombers first went over singly, 
only to follow the jets' fate. A 
squadron bloomed into a fiery 
ball as it neared the target. A 
long-range gun twenty miles 
away was demolished when its 
ammunition blew up shortly be- 
fore firing. 

Three days after George had 
killed his first man, action ceased. 
The countryside was deathly still. 
Not a living person could be seen 
for several miles around. But 
George still stood patiently in the 



76 




 



square. He stood there for three 
more days and yet nothing hap- 
pened. 

On the fourth day, he sensed 
that a solitary soldier had started 
toward the city from five miles to 
the east. In his mind's eye he 
followed the soldier approaching 
the city. The soldier, a sergeant, 
was bearing a white flag that flut- 
tered in the breeze; he was not 
armed. After an hour he saw the 
sergeant enter the square and 
walk toward him. When they 
were within twenty feet of one 
another, the soldier stopped and 
saluted. 

"Major General Pitt requests 
a meeting with you, sir," the 
soldier said, trembling and trying 
hard not to. 

"Do not be frightened," George 
said. "I see you intend me no 
harm." 

The soldier reddened. "Will 
you accompany me?" • 

"Certainly." 

The two turned toward the east 
and started to walk. 

TjMVE miles east of Brentwood 
-■- lies a small community named 
Minerva. Population: 200. The 
highway from Brentwood to Chi- 
cago cuts the town in twq. In the 
center of town, on the north side 
of the road, stands a new build- 
ing — the Minerva Town Hall — 
built the year before with money 
raised by the residents. It was 



the largest and most elaborat 
building in Minerva, which hae 
been evacuated three days be 
fore. 

On this morning the town hall 
was occupied by army men. Maj. 
Gen. Pitt fretted and fumed at 
the four officers and twenty en- 
listed men waiting in the building. 

"It's an indignity!" he railed 
at the men who were forced to 
listen to him. "We have orders to 
talk appeasement with him! Nuts! 
We lose a few men, a few planes 
and now we're ready to meet 
George halfway. What's the 
country coming to? There oughi 
to be something that would knoc- 
him out. Why should we have t* 
send in after him? It's disgust- 
ing!" 

The major general, a large man 
with a bristling white mustache 
and a red face, stamped back and 
forth in the council room. Some 
of the officers and men smiled to 
themselves. The general was a 
well known fighting man. Orders 
he had received hamstrung him 
and, as soldiers, they sympathized 
with him. 

"What kind of men do we have 
in the higher echelons?" He asked 
everybody in general and nobody 
in particular. "They won't ever 
let us have a field telephone 
We're supposed to make a repor 
by radio. Now isn't that smart?" 
He shook his head, looked the 
men over. "An appeasement team, 






THE SEVENTH ORDER 



77 



that's what you are, when you 
ought to be a combat team to 
lick hell out of George. 

"Why were you all assigned to 
this particular duty? I never saw 
any of you before and I under- 
stand you're all strangers to each 
other, too. Hell, what will they do 
next? Appeasement. I never ap- 
peased anybody before in my 
whole life. I'd rather spit in his 
eye. What am I supposed to talk 
about? The weather? What au- 
thority do I have to yak with a 
walking collection of nuts and 
bolts!" 

An officer strode into the room 
and saluted the general. "They're 
coming, sir," he said. 

"Who's coming? . . . My God, 
man," the general spluttered an- 
grily, "be specific. Who the hell 
are 'they'?" 

"Why, George and Sergeant 
Matthews, sir. You remember, the 
sergeant who volunteered to go 
into Brentwood — " 

"Oh, them. Well, all I have to 
say is this is a hell of a war. I 
haven't figured out what I am go- 
ing to say yet." 

"Shall I have them wait, sir?" 

"Hell, no. Let's get this over 
with. I'll find out what George 
has to say and maybe that'll 
give me a lead." 

Before George entered the 
Council chamber, he already 
knew the mind of each man. He 
saw the room through their eyes. 



He knew everything about them, 
what they were wearing, what 
they were thinking. All had guns, 
yet none of them would kill him, 
although at least one man, Maj. 
Gen. Pitt, would have liked to. 

They were going to talk ap- 
peasement, George knew, but he 
could also see that the general 
didn't know what line the con- 
versation would take or what 
concessions he could make on 
behalf of his people. 

Wait — there was > one man 
among the twenty-three who had 
an odd thought. It was a soldier 
he had seen looking through a 
window at him. This man was 
thinking about eleven o'clock, for 
George could see in the man's 
mind various symbols for fifteen 
minutes from then — the -hands 
of a clock, a watch, the numerals 
1 1 . But George could not see any 
significance to the thought. 

When he entered the room with 
the sergeant, he was ushered to 
a table. He sat down with Maj. 
Gen. Pitt, who glowered at him. 
Letting his mind roam the room, 
George picked up the numerals 
again and identified the man 
thinking them as the officer be- 
hind and a little to the right of 
the general. 

What was going to happen at 
eleven? The man had no con- 
scious thought of harm to anyone, 
yet the idea kept obtruding and 
seemed so out of keeping with his 






78 




 




other thoughts George assigned 
several of his circuits to the man. 
The fact that the lieutenant 
looked at his watch and saw that 
it was 10:50 steeled George still 
more. If there was to be trouble, 
it would come from this one man. 

"I'm General Pitt," the general 
said drily. "You're George, of 
course. I have been instructed to 
ask you what, exactly, your in- 
tentions are toward the United 
States and the world in general, 
with a view toward reaching some 
sort of agreement with you and 
others of your kind, who will, as 
you say invade the Earth." 

"Invade, General Pitt," George 
replied, "is not the word." 

"All right, whatever the word 
is. We're all familiar with the 
plan you've been talking about. 
What we want to know is, where 
do you go from here?" 

"The fact that there has been 
no reluctance on the part of the 
armed forces to talk of an agree- 
ment — even though I see that you 
privately do not favor such a talk. 
General Pitt — is an encouraging 
sign, ^rt/e of Zanthar would not 
want to improve a planet which 
could not be educated and would 
continually oppose our program. 
This will make it possible for 
me to turn in a full report in a 
few days how." 

"Will you please get to the 
point?" 

George could see that the lieu- 



TNE SEVENTH ORDER 



79 



tenant was looking at his watch 
again. It was 10:58. George 
spread his mind out more than 
twenty miles, but could find no 
installation, horizontally or ver- 
tically, that indicated trouble. 
None # of the men in the room 
seemed to think of becoming 
overly hostile. 

"Yes, General. After my mes- 
sage goes out, there ought to be 
a landing party on Earth within 
a few weeks. While waiting for 
the first party, there must be cer- 
tain preparations — " 

George tensed. The lieutenant 
was reaching for something. But 
it somehow didn't seem connected 
with George. It was something 
white, a handkerchief. He saw 
that the man intended to blow his 
nose and started to relax except 
that George suddenly became 
aware of the fact the man did not 
need to blow his nose! 

Every thought-piercing circuit 
became instantly energized in 
George's mind and reached out 
in all directions . . . 

There were at least ten* shots 
from among the men. They stood 
there surprised at their actions. 
Those who had fired their guns 
now held the smoking weapons 
Awkwardly in their hands. 

George's eyes were gone. Smoke 
curled upward from the two 
empty sockets where bullets had 
entered a moment before. The 
smoke grew heavier and his body 

80 



became hot. Some of him turned 
cherry red and the chair on which 
he had been sitting started to 
burn. Finally, he collapsed to- 
ward the table and rolled to the 
floor. 

He started to cool. He was no 
longer the shiny blue-steel color 
he had been — he had turned 
black. His metal gave off cracking 
noises and some of it buckled 
here and there as it cooled. 

A FEW minutes later, tense 
■^*- military men and civilians 
grouped around a radio receiver 
in Chicago heard the report and 
relaxed, laughing and slapping 
each other on the back. Only one 
sat unmoved in a corner. Others 
finally sought him out. 

"Well, Professor, it was your 
idea that did the trick. Don't 
you feel like celebrating?" one 
of them asked. 

Prof. Tomlin shook his head. 
"If only George had been a little 
more benign, we might have 
learned a lot from him." 

"What gave you the idea that 
killed him?" 

"Oh, something he said about 
the unconscious and subcon- 
scious," Prof. Tomlin replied. "He 
admitted they were not pene- 
trable. It was an easy matter to 
instill a post-hypnotic suggestion 
in some proven subjects and then 
to erase the hypnotic experience." 

"You make it sound easy." 


 






"It wasn't too difficult, really. 
It was finding the solution that 
was hard. We selected more than 
a hundred men, worked with them 
for days, finally singled out the 
best twenty, then made them for- 
get their hypnosis. A first lieu- 
tenant — I've forgotten his name — 
had implanted in him a command 
even he was not aware of. His 
subconscious made him blow his 
nose fifteen minutes after he saw 
George. Nearly twenty others had 
post -hypnotic commands to shoot 
George in the eyes as soon as 
they saw the lieutenant blow his 
nose. Of course we also planted 
a subconscious hate pattern, 
which wasn't exactly necessary, 
just to make sure there would 
be no hesitation, no inhibition, 
no limiting moral factor. 

"None of the men ever saw each 
other before being sent to 
Minerva. None realized that they 
carried with them the order for 



George's annihilation. The gen- 
eral, who was not one of the 
hypnotics, was given loose in- 
structions, as were several others, 
so they could not possibly know 
the intention. Those of us who 
had conducted the hypnosis had 
to stay several hundred miles 
away so that we could not be 
reached by George's prying 
mind . . . "' 

IN a pasture next to a wood near 
Brentwood, a metal box buried 
in the ground suddenly exploded, 
uprooting a catalpa tree. 

On a planet many millions of 
miles away, a red light — one of 
many on a giant control board — • 
suddenly winked out. 

A blue humanoid made an en- 
try in a large book: System 29578. 
Planet Three Inhabited. 

Too dangerous for any kind of 
development.

IN THE APRIL GALAXY 



As of late December 1951, GALAXY has bought material from 71 different writers. Thui 
the 90 stories in the first 18 issues represent really wide diversification of authorship. Som« 
of these hit and ran and may or may not be heard of again. Others, however, will become 
important names before long. 

The 71st name Is that of F. L Wallace. Mean anything to you? It will when you've read 
ACCIDENTAL FLIGHT, the novella in thejiext issue. The story is something of a shocker . . . 
a startling group of characters, isolated from the rest of the Solar System for humane and 
yet unwillingly brutal reasons, who won't stay and know they can't come home, but still 
must escape somehow. If you can keep your pulse rate normal while reading it, see your 
doctor for adrenalin shots.

JVEW TALES OF SPACE AND 
TIME, edited by Raymond J. 
Healy. Henry Holt & Co., New 
York, 1951. 294 pages, $3.50 

rilHIS collection of ten new sci- 
-■- ence fiction stories is rather 
disappointing. Of the ten, one tale 
seems to me to be truly great, 
three good, and six average or 
below. 

Kris Neville's "Bettyann" will 
become one of the classics of 
alien invasion, in my not too 
humble opinion. It brings to the 






field a quality so much of it lacks 
• — the quality of humanity. 

Gerald Heard's "B & M— 
Planet 4" (that's a title?) will 
enthrall Heardians, of whom I 
am one. It may well confuse and 
appall others. In its few pages we 
learn more about the "bees" of 
Heard's flying saucers, and about 
the festering society of his Dop- 
pelgangers, with an altogether 
satisfying Utopian outcome. 

Ray Bradbury's "Here There 
Be Tygers" is a bitterly enchant- 
ing tale of a world that tried to 



•2 




 



entice men to stay, but that failed 
because the men did not believe 
in beauty. 

Isaac Asimov's "In a Good 
Cause" is a well-done, but soci- 
ologically primitive tale. 

The others, by Frank Fenton 
and Joseph Petrarca, R. Bretnor, 
P. Schuyler Miller, Cleve Cart- 
mill, A. E. van Vogt, and Anthony 
Boucher, are all below par, some- 
how. 

CITY AT THE WORLDS 
END, by Edmond Hamilton. 
Frederick Fell, Inc., New York, 
1951. 239 pages, $2.75 

HERE is a most impressive ex- 
ample of the truism that, 
by using understatement, you can 
get away with murder in science 
fiction. 

We have to imagine a small 
city, Middletown by name, 
blasted by a super-super atom 
bomb from the "homy" Middle 
West of today into a future a 
billion years ahead. The Sun is 
dying, the Earth practically un- 
inhabitable. After a time some 
"people" of those days — human 
and otherwise — arrive from a far 
star in a spaceship and eventu- 
ally rehabilitate the world for the 
benefit of the Middletowners. 

The author has made a largely 
successful effort to keep the major 
components of his story within 
the bounds of the. human. Quite 



an accomplishment in view of 
the nature of the plot. 

DOUBLE IN SPACE, by 
Fletcher Pratt. Doubleday & Co., 
Inc., New York, 1951. 217 pages, 
$2.75 

TWO very recent novelets from 
Thrilling Wonder: "Project 
Excelsior" (originally called 
"Asylum Satellite"), and "The 
Wanderer's Return." Both are 
pure space opera, about l/64th 
of an inch deep. Very highly read- 
able — and just as 'highly forget- 
table. 

"Excelsior" tells of the Rus- 
sians with their Earth Satellite 
Vehicle a few thousand miles in 
space beyond ours, and how their 
probably nefarious plans (we 
never learn what they were) are 
hexed because their vehicle is 
found to be on collision course 
with the only asteroid in those 
parts. Our satellite nobly blasts 
the asteroid out of existence — in 
exchange for the Russkis' cure 
for radiation sickness. 

"The Wanderer's Return" is 
about the space commodore who 
has been "conditioned" to imitate 
the voyages of Ulysses in his 
travels around the Galaxy. A 
vigilant psychologist eventually 
catches onto and defeats the plot 
of the "Corporations" that were 
vilely trying to get Commodore 
Lortud's huge inheritance away

rights. $3.00 



THE GREEN HILLS OF 
EARTH, by Robert A. Heinlein. 
Shasta Publishers, Chicago, 1951. 
56 pages, $3.00 

jOHIS is the third Fall, 1951, 
-■- hard-cover Heinlein (see the 
February, 1952 GALAXY for the 
other two), and second in his 
"Future History Series*' that 
Shasta is reprinting from maga- 
zines. 

Three more are promised. 
Every one of the ten stories in 
the book is high-grade stuff, as 
is indicated by the fact that five 
of them have already appeared in 
other science fiction anthologies. 
The one I like best, "—We Also 
Walk Dogs," has not, and neither 
have the nearly as excellent 
"Logic of Empire" or "Ordeal in 
pace." 

"Space Jockey" and "Delilah 
and the Space Rigger," two 
lighter items, are here in hard 
covers for the first time. 

Previously anthologized items 
are: "The Long Watch," "Gen- 
tlemen, Be Seated," "The Black 
Pits of Luna," "It's Great to Be 
B§ck," and,, of course, "The 
Green Hills of Earth." 

Definitely a book for the per- 
manent shelf. 



iniGHTH in the series of vol- 
-■^ umes telling the Smithian 
saga of deep space and super- 
beings. For Kinnison-fans, Bos- 
kone-addicts, lovers of Arisia, 
"QX-ers," adherents of science 
fiction writing like this: "The 
Grey Lensman sent his sense of 
perception out beyond the con- 
fining walls and let it roam the 
void" — for such people this book 
will come as a delightfully famil- 
iar renewal of old acquaintances 
with bigger-than-Homeric heroes 
and villains. 

As for this reviewer, a notori- 
ously captious and hypercritical 
character, Grey Lensman simply 
gives him alternate waves of in- 
credulous laughter and dull, acid 
boredom. 

To the hundreds of irate citi- 
zens who are at once going to 
write in to GALAXY and blast 
me out of my britches for my 
sacrilege, I can only offer them 
the apology that I, too, once liked 
the Lensman series. It must be 
that I am growing old. I can no 
longer accept those comics as 
science fiction. I suspect, however, 
that it is science fiction which* is 
growing up and leaving these 
primitive artifacts behind.

HPHEY found the two men next 

•■- morning, in the gardens over- 
looking the old Harlem Canal. 



Powell was seated cross-legged on 
the wet turf, his face shriveled, 
his respiration almost gone, his 
pulse almost faded. Reich was 
curled into a tight fetal ball, com- 
pletely catatonic. 

They rushed Powell to his home 
on Hudson Ramp, where the en- 
tire Guild Lab team first sweated 
over him and then congratulated 
themselves on the first successful 
Mass Cathexis Measure in the 
history of the Esper Guild. There 
was no hurry for Reich. In due 
course and with proper procedure, 
his inert body was transported to 
Kingston Hospital. 

Eight days later, Powell arose, 
bathed, dressed, successfully de- 
feated his nurses in single com- 
bat and left the house. He made 
one stop at Sucre et Cie., emerged 
with a parcel and then proceeded 
to headquarters to make his per- 
sonal report to Commissioner 
Crabbe. 

On the way up, he poked his 
head into $$on's office. 

"Hi Chas. Did Peetcy back us 
up on the D' Courtney murder 
motive?" 

"Lock, stock # barrel. Trial 
took one hour. Reich's going 
through Demolition now" 

"That's nice. I'd better go up 
now and s-p-e-1-1 if out for 
Crabbe." 

"What you got under your 
arm?" 

"Present." 

"For Crabbe?"

Can Mean to Yon When in the 

Hospital for Sickness or Accident 

Money melts sway fast when you or a 
member of your family has 10 go to the 
hospital. You have to pay costly hos- 
pital board and room . . . doctor's bills 
and maybe tbe surgeon's bill too . . . 
necessary medicines, operating room 
fees— a thousand and one things you 
don't count on in advance. Ready casb

of saying what a Godsend this KEADY 
CASH BENEFIT WILL BE TO YOU. 
Heie's cash to go a long way toward 
paying heavy hospital expenses— and 
she money left over can help pay for 
time lost from your job or business. 
Remember— alt cash benefits are paid 
directly to you— and never to a doctor 
or hospital unless you so direct. This 
means you can use the money so your 
owa best advantage.

There's a big advantage to buying this 
policy by mail. This method of selling- by-

season why we can offer so much protec- 
tion a* you for so little money. 




"The kind Vd give him are 
against the law." 

"See you" 

Powell went up to Crabbe's 
ebony and silver office. Crabbe 
was properly solicitous, but stiff. 
The D'Courtney case had not im- 
proved his bitter relations with 
Powell. 

"Conviction," he said belliger- 
ently. "Damned if I see proper 
evidence." 

"It was a remarkably complex 
case, sir," Powell replied tact- 
fully. "None of us could under- 
stand it. Even Reich himself was 
# not aware of why he had mur- 
dered D'Courtney. The only one 
who grasped the case was the 
Prosecution Transistor Compu- 
ter." 

"Peetcy did? How?" 

"When we ran our final data 
through the first time, Peetcy told 
us that the 'passion motive' was 
insufficiently documented. We'd 
all been assuming profit motive. 
So had Reich. That was his con- 
scious camouflage for the real 
passion motive. It couldn't hold 
up as evidence because he offered 
merger to D'Courtney — and 
D'Courtney accepted! Reich mis- 
understood the message. He had 
to. He had to go on believing 
he murdered D'Courtney for 
money." 
"Why?" 

"Because he couldn't face the 
real motive ..." 
"Which was?" 



"D'Courtney was his father.** 

"What!" Crabbe stared. "His 
father? His flesh and blood?" 

"Yes, sir. It was all there be- 
fore us. We just couldn't see it 
. . . because Reich himself 
couldn't see it. That estate on 
Callisto, for instance, the one 
Reich used to lure Dr. %maine 
off the planet — Reich inherited it 
from his mother, who'd receive it 
from D'Courtney. We all assumed 
Reich's father had chiseled it out 
of D'Courtney in some kind of 
transaction and placed it in his 
wife's name. We were wrong. 
D'Courtney had given it to 
Reich's mother because it was 
his love-gift to the mother of his 
child." 

Crabbe opened his mouth, then 
closed it. 

"And there were other sign- 
posts. D' Courtney's suicide drive, 
produced by intense guilt sensa- 
tions of desertion. He had aban- 
doned his son. It was tearing 
him apart. Now add Barbara 
D'Courtney's half -twin image of 
herself and Ben Reich. Some- 
how she felt they were half- 
brother and sister. Reich's inabil- 
ity to kill Barbara — he knew it, 
top, deep in his unconscious. 
He wanted to destroy the hateful 
father who had rejected him, but 
he could not bring himself to 
harm his sister." 

"When did you unearth all 
this?" 

"When Reich attacked me for

setting those booby traps.** 

"Damn it, Powell; someone had 
to set them! If you didn't, who 
did?" 

"Reich himself, sir." 

"Reich!" 

"He murdered his father, which 
discharged his hatred. But his 
conscience could not permit him 
to go unpunished for such a hor- 
rible crime. Since the police ap- 
parently were unable to punish 
him, his conscience took over. 
That was the meaning of Reich's 
nightmare image." 

"The Man With No Face?" 

"Yes, Commissioner. It was the 
symbol of Reich's real relation- 
ship to D' Courtney. It had no 
face because Reich could not ac- 
cept the truth. It was first the 
threat of punishment for what 
he contemplated. Then it became 
the punishment itself for the 
murder." 

"The boobytraps?" 

"Exactly. Reich set those traps 
for himself without ever realizing 
it ... in brief departures from 
conscious reality. The tricks of 
the unconscious are fantastic." 

"But if Reich himself knew 
none of this, how did you get at 
it, Powell?" 

"We used the Mass Cathexis 
Measure, sir. It's difficult to ex- 
plain, but I'll do my best. Every 
human being has a psyche com- 
posed of latent and capitalized 
energy. Latent energy is our re- 
serve • . . the untapped natural 



resources of our mind. Capitalized 
energy is that latent energy which 
we call up and put to work. Most 
of us use only a small portion 
of our latent energy." 

"I understand." 

"When the Esper Guild uses 
the Mass Cathexis Measure, every 
Esper opens his psyche, so to 
speak, and contributes his latent 
energy to a pool. One Esper alone 
taps this pool and becomes the 
canal for the latent energy. H» 
capitalizes it and puts it to work; 
He can accomplish tremendous 
things ... if he can control it. 
It's a difficult and dangerous op- 
eration. About on a par with jet- 
ting to the Moon with a stick 
of dynamite — er — riding on dyna^ 
mite sticks." 

Suddenly Crabbe grinned. "I 
wish I were a peeper," he said. 
"I'd like to get the real image 
in your mind." 

"You've got it already, sir." 
Powell grinned back. An entente 
cordial had been established be- 
tween them for the first time. "It 
was necessary," Powell continued, 
"to bring Reich face to face with 
the Man With No Face. We had 
to make him see the truth before 
we could get the truth. Using the 
pool of latent energy, I built a 
common neurotic concept for 
Reich . . . the illusion that he 
alone in the world was real." 

"Why, I've often — is that com- 
mon?" 

"One of the run-of-the-mill e»- 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

cape patterns. When life gets 
tough for you, you take refuge 
in the idea that it's all a giant 
hoax. Reich had the seeds of 
that in him already. I simply 
forced them. I tore it all down 
and I very nearly tore myself 
apart doing it . . . but I left 
Reich alone in nothingness with 
the Man With No Face. Then, 
because there was nowhere else 
to look, he looked into the face 
and saw himself and his father. 
Once we had that, we had every- 
thing we needed." 

Powell picked up his parcel and 
arose. Crabbe jumped up and es- 
corted him to the door with a 
friendly hand on his shoulder. 

"You've done a phenomenal 
job, Powell. Really phenomenal. 
All I can say is that it must be a 
wonderful thing to be an Esper. 
You must all be very happy." 

Powell paused at the door. 
" Would you be happy to live 
your life in a hospital, Commis- 
sioner?" 

"A hospital?" 

"That's where we Espers live 
, . . all of us. In the psychiatric 
ward. Without escape, without 
refuge. Be grateful you're not a 
peeper, sir. Be grateful that you 
see only the outward man. Be 
grateful that you never see the 
passions, the hatreds, the jeal- 
ousies, the malice, the sicknesses. 
The world will be a wonderful 
place when everyone's a peeper 
and properly adjusted. But until 



then, be grateful you're blind." 

He left headquarters, hired a 
Jumper and was jetted north to- 
ward Kingston Hospital. He sat 
in the cabin with the parcel on 
his knees, gazing down at the 
magnificent Hudson valley. 

Kingston Hospital came into 
view, acre upon rolling acre of 
magnificent landscaping, solari- 
ums, pools, lawns, athletic fields, 
dormitories, clinics, all in ex- 
quisite neo-classic design. As the 
Jumper descended, Powell could 
make out the figures of patients 
and attendants, bronzed, active, 
laughing, playing. 

He checked in at the Visitors 
Office, found Barbara D'Court- 
ney's location and started across 
the grounds. He was weak, but 
felt impelled to leap hedges, vault 
gates, run races. He had awak- 
ened from his siege with Reich 
with a sudden knowledge that 
exhilarated him. It was a fact 
always known to him, he realized, 
but deliberately concealed by his 
sense of responsibility. 

"I really have got too damned 
much super-ego," he grum- 
bled. "It takes itself so seriously." 

They saw each other at the 
same moment, across a broad 
stretch of lawn flanked by field- 
stone terraces and brilliant rock- 
gardens. She flew toward him, 
waving, and he ran toward her. 
Then, as they approached, both 
were stricken with shyness. They 
stopped a few feet apart, not 



154 




 



daring to look at each other. 

"Hello." 

"Hello, Barbara." He paused. 
"Let's get into the shade." 

They turned toward the terrace 
wall. Powell glanced at her from 
the corner of his eye. She was 
alive as he had never seen her. 
And the urchin expression in her 
face — the expression that he had 
imagined was a phase of her 
Deja Eprouve development — was 
still there. She looked inexpres- 
sibly mischievous, high-spirited, 
fascinating. But she was adult. 
He did not know her. 

"I'm being discharged this eve- 
ning," Barbara said. 

"I know." 

They sat down on a stone 
bench. She looked at him with 
grave eyes. "I want to tell you 
how grateful I am." 

"Please, Barbara. You're mak- 
ing me uncomfortable." 

"Am I?" 

"I knew you so intimately as — 
well, as a child. Now — " 

"Now I'm grown up again.** 

"Yes." 

"You must get to know me 
better. Shall we say tea tomorrow 
at five? Informal." 

"Listen," Powell said desper- 
ately. "I helped dress you more 
than once. And comb your hair. 
And brush your teeth." 

She waved her hand airily. 

"You liked fish, but you hated 
lamb. You hit me in the eye with 
a chop." 



"That was ages ago, Mr. Pow- 
ell." 

"That was two weeks ago, Miss 
D'Courtney." 

She arose with magnificent 
poise. "Really, Mr. Powell ! If you 
feel impelled to cast chronograph- 
ical aspersions . . ." She stopped 
and looked at him. The urchin 
appeared again in her face. 
"Chronographical?" she inquired. 

He dropped the parcel and 
caught her in his . arms. 

"Mr. Powell," she murmured. 
"Hello, Mr. Powell." 

"My God, Barbara — Baba, u 
dear. For a moment I thought 
you meant it." 

"I was paying you back for 
being grown up." 

"You always were a vindictive 
kid." 

"You always were a mean 
daddy." She leaned back and 
looked at him. "Mary Noyes told 
me. Everything." 

"Oh. She did?" 

Barbara nodded. "She was 
right. I'll settle for anything." 

He laughed, the exhilaration 
bubbling vibrantly from him. 
"You won't have to settle for 
anything. Sit down. I want to 
ask you something." 

She sat down. 

On his lap. 

"I have to go back to that 
night," he said. 

"In Beaumont House?" 

He nodded. 

"It's not easy to talk about,** 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



Iff, 



she whispered miserably. 

"It won't take a minute. You 
were lying in bed, asleep 4 Sud- 
denly you woke up, and rushed 
into the Orchid room. You re- 
member the rest ..." 

"I remember." 

"One question. What was the 
cry that woke you?" 

"You know." 

"I want you to say it. Say it 
out loud." 

"Do you think it's — it's going 
to send me into hysteria again?" 

"Say it." 

After a long pause, she said in 
a low voice, "Help, Barbara," and 
waited in fear. Nothing happened. 
She relaxed, though afraid. 

"Who shouted that?" 

"My father, of course." 

"He couldn't shout, Barbara. 
His throat was gone. Cancer. He 
could barely whisper." 

"But I heard him ! M 

"You peeped him." 

She stared. 

"You peeped him," Powell re- 
peated gently. "Your father cried 
out on the telepathic level. You 
heard him. There was no other 
way you could have heard him 
except telepathically." 

"But that would mean I'm an 
Esper," she objected. "I'm not 
one at all." 

"In spite of proof that you 
are?" 

"It's just your opinion," she 
said insistently, "Maybe just a 
hope." 



"Do you love me?" Powell shot 
at her. 

"I love you, of course/' she 
answered, "but I think ypu're in- 
venting excuses to — " 

"Who asked you?" 

"Asked me what?" 

"If you loved me." 

"Why, you just—" 

"I didn't say anything," he told 
her quietly. "I thought my Ques- 
tion; you peeped me. You were 
unconsciously peeping Mary and 
me all the while you were in my 
house. You peeped Reich when 
he came there to set a boobytrap 
for me. Don't you understand 
now, Barbara?" 

"Oh, if it were only true!" 

"It is, darling. You won't have 
to settle for anything short of us. 
You're a latent Esper. You'll he 
trained, of course . . . as a Guild 
member and my wife. You heard 
me, didn't you?" 

"Yes, Preston," she whispered, 

"One of the first things you'll 
learn is that words aren't neces- 
sary," he said. "Now, for ex- 
ample." 

Their kiss was long and deep, 
but not a fraction as urgent and 
hungry as the need they read 
clearly in each other. This, he let 
her realize without words, while 
their lips were still together, was 
why an Esper could Jove only 
another Esper ... and why Esper 
love was to deaf-mute love as 
animal instinct was to human 
reasoning. 



156 




 



She put her head on his 
shoulder at last, shaken, yet 
somehow at peace. Then the 
urchin smile came to her face as 
she glanced at the package he 
had put down on the bench be- 
side him. 

"A present?*' she wheedled. 
"For Baba?" 

He stood up, suddenly remem- 
bering. "No, of course not. It's 
for someone who needs it a good 
deal more." He took her chin in 
his hand and kissed her again. 
"Run back to your pavilion and 
wait for me. There's somebody 
I've got to see. I'll be along soon 
• . . to take you home." 

She scampered off across the 
lawn, dangerously looking back 
at him instead of where she was 
going. Powell watched her go, 
partly to make sure she didn't 
crash into anything, mostly to 
feel the warmth of her love wash- 
ing over his mind. Then he went 
to the Demolition Section of 
Kingston Hospital. 

When a man was Demolished 
at Kingston, his entire psyche 
was destroyed. The series of os- 
motic injections began with the 
topmost strata of cortical syn- 
apses and slowly worked down, 
switching off every circuit, ex- 
tinguishing every memory, de- 
stroying every particle of the 
pattern that had been built up 
since birth. 

But this was not the pain nor 
the dread of Demolition. The hor- 



ror lay in the fact that the con- 
sciousness was never lost; that 
as the psyche was wiped out, the 
mind was aware of the slow, 
backward death, until at last it, 
too, disappeared and awaited the 
rebirth. It was an eternity of fare- 
wells ... an agonising funeral 
of oneself. And as Powell stood 
alongside Ben Reich's bed, he saw 
the awareness, the pain, the de- 
spair in those blinking, twitching 
eyes. 

Dr. Johnny Jeems put his hand 
on Reich's arm. "He's a lusty lad. 
We have great hopes for him." 

Reich squalled and writhed. 

"How's the treatment coming?** 
Powell asked anxiously. 

"Wonderful. Ought to be ready 
for rebirth in a year." 

"He's a great guy. We need 
men like him. It would have been 
a shame to lose Ben Reich." 

"Lose him?*' Jeems repeated in 
astonishment. "How?" 

"Three or four hundred years 
*g°> Johnny, cops caught people 
like Reich to kill them. Capital 
punishment, they called it." 

"It doesn't make sense, a man 
who's got the talent and* guts 
to buck society obviously is valu- 
able potentially. If you don't 
straighten him out and turn him 
into a plus value — hell, it would 
be a criminal human waste!" 

"They were pretty good at 
criminal human waste in those 
days," Powell said. He took the 
beautifully wrapped package from 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



157 



under his arm. "This, for ex- 
ample, would have been called 
gushing sentimentally over an 
outlaw of society." 

Jeems watched silently, sym- 
pathetically, as Powell held out 
the package to what was left of 
Reich. "It's a present for you, 
Ben. Take it." The creature glow- 
ered at Powell and then at the 
box. At last the clumsy hands 
took the gift, tore away the wrap- 
pings, scooped up a handful of 
Sucre et Cie.'s magnificent can- 
dies and stuffed them into the 
lax mouth. 

"He's done all right in the gift 
department," Jeems said, nodding 
at the flowers, piezo crystal re- 
cordings, pieces of sculpture, a 
cage of small, active animals from 
Venus, and exotic Ampro plants 
that covered the tables and 
shelves in the room. 

"From Commissioner Crabbe, 
old T-H himself, Dr. Wilson 
%maine," said Powell, reading 
the cards. He paused at one. 
* Jeremy Church, too. After the 
way Church hated Reich for get- 
ting him expelled from the Esper 
Guild . . . damn it, Johnny, it's 
hard to believe, isn't it?" 

"No," Jeems said. "Why should 



it be? A criminal is a sick person. 
Naturally you put him in the 
hospital and send him gifts. How 
else should any criminal be 
treated?" 

"How else indeed?" Powell re- 
peated gently. 

Out of the chaos in Reich's 
stripped mind came a fragment of 
thought : "Powell — peeper — Pow- 
ell—friend ..." 

It was so sudden, so unex- 
pected, so passionately grateful 
that Powell gripped Reich's 
shoulder and tried to smile, then 
had to turn and hurry out toward 
the pavilion and Barbara. 

One ill mind had been rescued. 
There had been fear and frustra- 
tion, danger to the Solar System 
and to Powell and Barbara and 
to Reich himself, death for an 
old, guilt-ridden man too tired 
to live. But one sick personality 
had been saved. Some day it 
would be the entire human race. 
Until then, the Espers had to 
nurse and guard and guide a 
world that was diseased with 
psychic blindness. 

Was it worth it? 

Yes, Powell decided without 
hesitation, it was.

Since the last war, a great musical awakening

composers have been writing important music 
for the past 200 years/ 

Now, an outstanding non-profit institution 
has embarked on a program of creating high- 
fidelity recordings of 200 years of American 
music ! Every form of musical expression is in- 
cluded in this program — symphonic, choral, 
chamber works, folk music . . . music of Amer- 
ica at work and at play; music of America 
growing, laughing . . . music born of the love 
of liberty and the love of fun, the love of good 
living and the love of God. Whatever your 
tastes — here is music for you ! 

HOW THIS MUSIC CAME TO BE RECORDED 

Recently, the directors of the renowned Alice M- 
Ditson Fund of Columbia University established 
a substantial grant to create the non-profit Dit- 
son Musical Foundation, whose sole purpose is

fidelity full-frequency recording of American 
music, on Long-Playing records.

Odd John 

by Otaf Stapledon 

"Odd John" was the nickname given this strange youth . . . 
and odd he certainly was. With his incredibly gifted skills and 
his awesomely developed mind, he could have attained power, 
fame, money — an entire nation or even the world! 

But it would have been like a genius ruling an asylum of 
Imbeciles. For Odd John was not of the human race; he belonged 
lo the next stage of evolution — Homo Superior! 

He could not be the only one, he reasoned. There must be 
others like himself. But where would he find them? And if he 
did, would they agree to his plan to breed only among them- 
selves ... to create the race that would some day replace Homo 
Sapiens? And what would mankind, with his powerful weapons 
and unleashed fear, do to stop the threat? 

Many authors have tried to write the story of Homo Superior 
and failed — just as Pithecanthropus, describing Modern Man, 
would find it an impossible job. But Stapledon succeeded! This 
is THE masterpiece of superman stories, truly a great work of 
science fiction!

THERE are some things that can not 
be generally told — things you ought 
to know. Great truths are dangerous 
to some — but factors for personal 
power and accomplishment in the 
hands of those who understand them. 
Behind the tales of the miracles and

turies of their secret probing into 
nature's laws — their amazing discov- 
eries of the hidden processes of man's 
mind, and the mastery of life's prob-

avoid their destruction by mass fear 
and ignorance, these facts remain a 
useful heritage for the thousands of

them in their homes today.
