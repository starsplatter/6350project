World Without Children By DAMON KNIGHT 

THE last diapers were in 
museums, along with teething rings, layettes, formula 
bottles, perambulators, rattles and 
teddy bears. Swings and trapezes, 
slides and jungle gyms had been 
broken up for scrap. The books, 
most of them, had been junked: 
Baby and Child Care, Black 
Beauty, Obstetrics for the Millions, Tom Swift and his Rocket 
Glider, What Every Boy Should 
Know, What Every Girl Should 
Know, Diseases of Childhood, 
The Book of Knowledge, Mantiers for Teeners, One Hundred 
Things a Boy Can Make. 

The last recorded birth had 
been two hundred years ago. 

That child — who had also been 
the last to wear a snowsuit, the 
last to cut his finger playing with 
knives, and the last to learn 
about women — had now reached 
he physiological age of twenty ive years, • and looked even 
younger owing to his excellent 
condition. His name was George 
Miller; he had been a great curiosity in his day and a good many 
people still referred to him as 
The Child. 

George did his best to live up 
to the name. Everything he did 
was essentially outre'; everything 
he wore was outlandish; everything he said was outrageous. He 
got along better with most 
women than with most men. He 
said the sort of things to women 
that made them say, "Oh, 
George/" half wincing, half melting. 

At the moment he was busy 
explaining to Lily Hoffman, head 
of the Human Conservation 
League, why he had never permanently given up drinking or 
smoking. 

"Oh, George," said Lily. 

"No, really," said George earnestly. "You say having fun will 
take ten per cent off my life. 
Well, but Art Levinson tells me 
that my present life expectancy 



is probably somewhere around 
three thousand years. So if he's 
right, and you're right, my disgraceful habits won't catch up 
to me until 5062 A.d. and by that 
time I expect to be glad enough 
to lie down." 

Lily tilted her careful blonde 
curls forward to avoid a drink 
in the hand of a wandering guest 
"That's an average, George," she 
said. "And of course it's only a 
guess, because nobody who's had 
the longevity treatments early in 
life has passed away from old 
age yet. Now I personally believe 
that it's possible to live for ten 
thousand years or more. And, 
George, just suppose you did pass 
away in 5062 from overindulgence, and the very next year 
they found a way to extend the 
life-span even more!" 

"Good Lord," said George, 
looking distressed. "That would 
be a laugh on me, wouldn't it?" 

"Really, George, this is a serin 
ous — " 

George put his hand on her 
arm. "You're right," he said, with 
fervor. "I might be throwing 
away the best centuries of my 
life. I'll stop this very minute."* 
He took a beautifully chased silver cigarette case out of his breast 
pocket and emptied it into his 
hand. "If you'll excuse me," he 
said, rising, "I'll go and throw 
these in the fireplace so as not to 
be tempted." 




 



She called after him, "George, 
stick to it. That's the important 
thing. You've quit before, you 
know." 

"I know," said George humbly. 

Carrying the cigarettes at arm's 
length, as if they were a clutch 
of poisonous serpents, he maneuvered his slender body among 
the standing, sitting and perambulating guests until he reached 
the fireplace-' 

"Hello, Luther," he said to a 
gray-haired, comfortably plump 
man wearing rimless spectacles. 
"I'm enjoying your party." He 
dropped the cigarettes ceremoniously behind a charred log. 

"Again?" asked Luther Wheatley amiably. 

"Lily talked me into it," 
George told him. "You ought to 
try virtue some time, Luther,. It 
gives you a sort of intense feeling, 
an I-am-the-master-of-my-fate 
kind of thing. Besides, it's an inexhaustible source of conversation. And then when you finally 
succumb, you have such a delightful sense of wickedness. I 
think everybody ought to abstain 
from everything once in a while, 
just to keep from taking it for 
granted." 

"George," said Luther, frowning in concentration, "I believe 
that is the same discovery that 
you first announced to me when 
you were about twenty-three. 
How do you manage to — shall I 



say — keep your mind so fresh?'' 

"How do you manage to remember every damned thing IV • 
said over the course of a hundre< i 
and fifty-odd years?" Georg.countered irritably. 

"You always say the same 
thing." One of Luther's cats wan dered by, and Luther stooped t i 
pick it up. It was a pretty thin,' . 
marked like a Siamese, but wit 
long, light fur. It stared at Luthe 
with offended dignity and mad 
a noise in its throat. 

"Haven't seen that one before, 
have I?" George asked. 

"No. She's a distant descendant 
of Mimi, though — sixteen generations removed. You remember 
Mimi." 

"I do, indeed. A great cat. 
Luther. You weren't worthy of 
her. Pity they're so short-lived, 
isn't it?" 

"That's why I like them," 
Luther said, letting the cat drip 
from his hands like golden taffy. 
"People are so inconveniently 
permanent. . . . Art! Is that you? 
I thought you were in Pasadena 
for the season." 

A stocky, owl-faced man with 
a shining bald pate put his hand 
on Wheatley's shoulder. "I flew 
in especially to see you, Luther," 
he said. "Hello, George. You, 
too." He shook hands with them 
in turn. "Can we go somewhere 
and talk? It's important. Is 
Morey here?"

Luther peered across the room. 
"He's around somewhere." He 
stopped a man carrying a tray 
of cocktail glasses and said, 
"Find Mr. Stiles for me, will you? 
Tell him I'd like to see him in 
my study." He took the owlish 
man's arm and gently propelled 
him toward the door, leaving 
George to trail along. "How are 
you, you dog-robber? How are 
the famous Levinson fruit-flies?" 

"How are the cats?" 

"Esthetically rewarding, which 
Is more than I can say for your 
noxious pets." 

Luther opened the study door 
and ushered them in. It was an 
almost fanatically tidy place, like 
the rest of Luther's apartment. 
There was a small window looking out on the roof-tops of Venice; the Rio Foscari was on the 
opposite side of the building. 
There were a desk, a work table, 
an easy chair and two straight 
chairs. The walls were covered 
with shelves of books : mostly history and genetics, with the usual 
peppering of salty novels. 

Two cats were in the easy chair, 
one in each of the straight chairs, 
and one asleep on the table. 

"Dump them off," said Luther, 
setting an example and easing 
liimself into the one comfortable 
chair. "You can sit on the table, 
George — you've got the youngest 
and most resilient ligaments." 

A man y/ith the long, cartila


genous face of an honest son of 
toil appeared in the doorway. His 
collar was too big and too stiff, 
his tie creased and askew, and 
his short iron-gray hair was 
fiercely rumpled like a eagle's 
nest. He looked as if he might 
bite, until he smiled; then he 
looked unexpectedly shy and 
friendly. 

His voice was a subdued rumble: "Hello, Art. Glad to see you. 
What's the bad news?" 

"It's bad, all right," said Levinson. His round face was serious 
as he bit off the end of a cigar 
with a quick, nervous gesture. 
"Shut the door, will you, Morey?" 

He looked at the unlit cigar 
and put it down. "Listen," he 
said, "I could build up to this 
gradually and spare your nerves, 
but I haven't got the patience. I 
found out something last week 
that scared me to my toenails." 

He stopped and glanced at 
each of them. They seemed impressed. George did, too, but 
grim seriousness always impressed him. It made him feel 
uncomfortable enough to want to 
drive it off with a facetious remark, but before he had a chance 
to think of one, Luther said to 
Levinson, "You really are upset, 
Art, and that's something you 
don't do easily." He looked just 
above George's head. "Are you 
sure we're the ones you want to 
tell?" 




 



"Now look here," George said, 
beginning to get angry. "I may 
be the youngest of you, but I'm 
not a kid to be — " 

"I wanted George here," Levinson interrupted. "He is younger, 
and because of that he's inclined 
to be less stodgy. Also, he has 
more of trie adventurousness of 
youth, and that may be damned 
important." 

George sat iback, compressing 
his lips and giving one emphatic 
nod. 

«"What scared you, Art?" asked 
Stiles. 

Levinson broke the cigar with 
bitter abruptness. "The human 
race," he said bluntly, "is ninetenths sterile." 

'T'HE others looked at him in 
shocked silence. George 
glanced around, saw that nobody 
else was ready to speak, and 
asked, "How did you find out?" 

"Restocking my sperm and ova 
banks," said Levinson. "I've been 
keeping them for a good many 
years, you may remember. There 
are a lot of men and women living today who have never had 
children. Good stock — stock we'll 
need when and if the race starts 
breeding again, and yet any one 
of those people might get killed 
in an accident and we'd lose it. 
So I've been keeping up the 
banks, though I never thought 
I'd see them used for another 



couple of thousand years. But 
nine out of ten donors are now 
sterile." 

"You checked?" asked Luther. 

"Naturally. I've got samples 
from North and South America, 
from Europe, Asia, Africa. All 
the same. There it is — we're 
standing on top of the last slide 
down to hell." 

Stiles looked puzzled. He said, 
"How do you know it's going to 
get worse, Art?" 

"It's that kind of thing — a progressive change. Morphological 
deterioration. Sperm with two 
tails, three tails, no tail, or all 
but motionless. Ova that can't be 
fertilized. I've made some tentative charts. I haven't got enough . 
data yet for accuracy, but the 
breakdown seems to begin in men 
who are physiologically at least 
forty and chronologically at least 
three hundred. In women, a little 
earlier. That includes damn near 
everybody. I'm not kidding, 
Morey. In five to ten years more, 
there won't be enough viable 
stock left to start the human race 
again." 

"Have you got any idea what's 
causing it, Art?" George asked. 

"Only the obvious one — it's 
just one more side effect of longevity. You know that in gross 
terms what the treatments do is 
to slow down your catabolic rate. 
In about fifty years, in other 
words, you age about as much as 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN 



you would naturally in one year. 
At first it was thought that that 
was all the treatments did, but 
we know better now. We have the 
expected increase in 'diseases of 
the aged' — kidneys, heart, liver, 
arteriosclerosis, calcium deposits 
and so on — but we also have a 
rash of things nobody figured on. 
Cancer, for instance, came close 
to wiping out the race until they 
licked it at the Gandhi Center 
about two hundred years ago. 
Then there's an unexpected drop 
in resistance to respiratory infections along about age-of-record 
250. And now this." 

"What have you done about 
it?" asked Stiles. "You talk to 
anybody in the government?" 

"Sure." Levinson picked up a 
fresh cigar and bit into it savagely. "I talked to Van Dam, the 
Public Health Commissioner, 
after sitting around his office for 
three days, and he took it up 
with President Golightly. He 
brought me back Golightly's answer. Here it is." 

He took a folded piece of paper 
out of his vest pocket. 

" 'Thank you for your interesting report, which I am turning 
over to the appropriate department for further study. In reply 
to your question, resumption of 
wholesale breeding at this time 
would be prejudicial to world 
peace and security, and no such 
measure will be entertained until 



all other avenues have been exhausted.' " 

He stuffed the note back into 
his pocket. 

"What about those other avenues, Art?" asked Stiles. 

"Nonexistent. There is no 
known cure for morphological 
sterility in men or women, and 
not even a promising line of research. We've got to start breeding, that's all. No way out of it. 
But that trained-seal department 
of Golightly's will kick the problem around for ten, twenty, fifty 
years. By that time we might as 
well start carving our own monuments. Prejudicial to world peace 
and security," he added bitterly. 

Stiles scratched his ear, looking mournful. "It would kick up 
kind of a rumpus, Art," he said, 
"He's right there." 

Levinson turned on him. "Try 
to see a little further than your 
own union for once, Morey. 
Would you let the whole blasted 
race die just to preserve the 
shortage of masons?" 

" 'Tain't only that," said Stiles, 
unruffled. "We'd be ready for another war as soon as the population got big enough, for one 
thing." 

"Let's have a couple of more 
voices here," said Levinson. 
"Luther, any comment?" 

Luther sighed. "Shall I get out 
my checkbook now, Art, or do 
you want me: to wait until I've 



10 




 



liquidated some of my holdings?" 

Levinson shrugged at him. "It's 
going to cost you, all right," he 
agreed. "All three of you. We'll 
need about three hundred thousand credits to start. More later." 

"Much more, Art?" ' Luther 
queried. 

"Plenty. We've got to set up 
at least half a dozen birth centers, each equipped to handle upward of a thousand children and 
meet all their needs, if necessary, 
over a twenty-year period. We'll 
build the centers, or buy and 
adapt them. They've got to be 
in out-of-the-way places and adequately camouflaged to fool the 
Security Police. We've got to staff 
them, service them, arrange for 
protection — and we've got to do 
it fasf." He looked at each of 
them in turn. "I know that all 
three of you are worth several 
million apiece. I may want all of 
it before we're through." 

There was a short silence. Then 
Stiles coughed and looked apologetic. "Let's just clear up a few 
points, Art. One thing, it seems 
to me that this cloak-and-dagger 
stuff is unnecessary. Why not 
take it to the people? Force the 
Golightly gang to repeal the birth 
prohibition?" 

Levinson said, "You've done 
some publicity, Morey. How long 
do you think it would take to put 
such a program over, on a worldwide scale?" * 



Stiles frowned. "A year, maybe . . ." He winced comically. 
"All right, all right, I know what 
you're going to say. It would 
take Golightly just about twentyfour hours to throw us all in 
pokey. I was just stalling on that 
one, I guess. But here's another 
thing, Art. As I get it, you're figuring on six thousand kids or 
more in the first generation. Why 
so many?" , 

"Simply because I'm afraid we 
won't be able to do much better. 
If we could manage a million, we 
still couldn't save all the useful, 
strains that are still viable. It's 
like this, Morey: Suppose there 
are only five men and five women 
in the world. Each one has some 
quality that the others don't in 
his heredity. One has mechanical 
ingenuity, another one leadership, 
another one artistic imagination, 
and so on. If one of those couples 
fails to reproduce, there are two 
qualities gone forever. Multiply 
that by a billion and there's our 
problem." 

He waved his cigar at Stiles's 
nose. "Don't forget, we're down 
to ten per cent of our stock already. The best we can hope to 
do is to patch together some kind 
of crude imitation of the human 
race, and hope it will work. If 
we manage to save homo sap at 
all, we'll be damned lucky." 

Stiles leaned forward, elbows 
on knees, and laced his big fingers

together. "Art, I don't know — " 
he said slowly. 

George, who was facing the 
door, saw it open a crack. He said 
quietly, "We have visitors." 

As the others turned, the door 
swung open all the way. A 
woman with coppery hair piled 
around the merest sketch or suggestion of a hat was leaning into 
the room with her slender hand 
on the doorknob. George caught 
a glimpse of someone standing 
behind her, and then, smiling 
brilliantly, she was advancing 
toward them like a minor natural 
catastrophe. 

"There you all are," she said 
happily. "Hiding! Did you think 
I wasn't coming, Luther? Art, 
when did you get into town? Why 
didn't you call me? Morey, you're 
looking as eatable as ever. 
George, darling," she finished, 
and patted him on the cheek. 

The four of them were standing, even Luther, who normally 
made getting out of a chair a 
ceremony. George found his heart 
going at an unusual rate. 
Glancing at the others, he conjectured that they all felt the 
came symptoms as far as the 
state of their arteries would permit. Luther and Art were beaming, and Morey^ grin was a little 
more shy than usual. Hilda Place 
affected men like that — all men, 
as far as George had been able to 
discover. 



She had enormous brilliant 
eyes, with faint bluish shadows 
under them, the eyes of a mature 
and knowing woman ; but her lips 
had the softness of youth. Her 
slender body was covered from 
throat to wrist and calf by her 
dark green dress. Hilda preferred 
not to expose herself in public; 
she had never worn the showcase 
gowns that were currently fashionable. 

Accepting their greetings, she 
gave each of them a kiss on the 
cheek. All except George. While 
he was still telling himself that it 
was absurd for this to matter so 
much to him, she had turned and 
brought a stranger into the group. 

"I want you all to meet Joseph 
Krueger," she said gaily. "He's 
the most fascinating man in the 
world, and I want everybody to 
remember that I discovered him. 
Gentlemen, this is the Man From 
the Past!" 

The Man From the Past 
looked as young as George; he 
was well set up, but had a curious awkwardness about him, a 
coltish uncertainty. He had a 
large, chin, mild eyes behind 
dark-rimmed spectacles, and an 
engaging smile. George, despite a 
stab of jealousy, decided that he 
liked him. 

"I'm not a time traveler or 
anything," Krueger was saying. 
"That's only Miss Place's exaggeration. I'm an amnesiac, they 




 




tell me. I found myself standing 
on a street corner in Vienna two 
weeks ago, and the last thing I 
remember before that was having 
a drink in Wichita, Kansas, in 
December, 1953. So I'm amusingly ignorant, as Miss Place puts 
if 

"Astonishing," said Levinson. 

"Isn't it?" said Hilda delightedly. Her parted lips were moist. 
"This is all new to him. He 
drinks it in like a man from Mars 
— about the world government, 
and what happened to New York, 
and G-string parties — " 

"And people hundreds of years 
old," Krueger put in. "That, 
mostly." 

Levinson was still pursuing his 
own thought. "You lived under 
amnesia for better than three 
centuries, then," he said. "That 
must be a record. You have no 
idea what you were doing all that 
time, I suppose?" 

Krueger shock hL l.vad. "No, 
sir. I've made inquiries, of course, 
but there was nothing in my 
pockets that gave any clue, and 
apparently I didn't live in Vienna; I couldn't find anybody 
who knew me there. Actually, I 
don't mind very much — I feel like 
what Miss Place calls me, the 
Man From the Past. I'm having 
a time just trying to catch up." 

"We've been to see the Peace 
Monument, and Chico's, and the 
Doges' Palace—"

IS 



"And the pretty girls on the 
Lido," added Krueger, widening 
his grin. 

" — and we're still not half done. 
I'm exhausted," Hilda said. "And 
I've got to disappear for a few 
weeks on business, so I hope some 
of you will find time to show Joseph the sights. Not you, Luther. 
I know you never go out. And, 
Art, I suppose you're running 
back to your fruit-flies. But 
Morey? Or George?" 

Krueger looked uncomfortable. 
"I don't want to be any bother." 

"Not at all," said George sympathetically. "You're a novelty, 
you know, and that's a rare thing 
after the first hundred years or 
so. Have you got any notion 
where you'd like to go next, or 
is it all too new?" 

"Too new, I'm afraid. But any 
place I haven't seen yet would 
be fine with me, as long as I'm 
no trouble." 

"I'll work out an itinerary and 
call you," said George. "Let me 
have your address and number." 

V UTHER said, "Meanwhile. 

shall we go mingle with the 
populace? I've got to, anyway. 
Some of them would probably 
recognize me if they saw me and 
Will be hurt if they don't." He offered his arm to Hilda and they 
Started out. He turned at the door 
to ask Levinson, "You're staying 
4fae night at least, aren't you. 



Art? Good. We'll all get together 

again a little later." 

George exchanged a few more 
words with Krueger, introduced 
him to three beautiful women, 
and wandered off looking for 
Hilda. 

He found her in the middle of 
a tight group near the end of the 
room where dancing was being 
attempted to the strains of Luther's music-library outlet, and 
wormed his way in to her. 

"Dance with me?" he asked 
hopefully. 

"Of course, George," she said, " 
and a reluctant lane opened for 
them. Then her lithe warm body 
was in his arms, and the ridiculous gilded feathers on her hat 
were tickling his ear. 

"I rather like your Joe," he 
said. 

"I'm glad. Isn't he delicious?" 
Her breath warmed the side of 
his neck. 

"Haven't kissed him,"* said 
George. "I'll have to take your 
word for it." 

Somehow, without seeming to 
withdraw deliberately, she no 
longer was quite so close to him. 

"Sorry, " he said."That slipped." 

"I didn't like it," she told him, 
"but I think I'll forgive you, because I like you so much. Actually, though, you're wrong. Joseph is one man I'm absolutely 
certain I shall never have an affair with."

"That's not much comfort," 
George said grumpily. "It seems 
to make two of us — Joseph and 
me." 

She smiled up at him. "As if it 
matters, darling. There are so 
many women in the world." 

"But it's you I want." 

"For the moment." 

HE stared in astonishment at 
her softly laughing eyes. 
"Well, good Lord, you don't think 
it should be forever, do you? I 
mean monogamy was all very 
well for a short-lived human race, 
but—" 

"Don't be silly, George. Nobody could stand one mate for 
what may be centuries or even 
more. It's a horrifying thought.** 

"Then what are you trying to 
tell me?" he challenged. 

"I'm very fond of you; you 
know that. And I'm very pleased 
and flattered that you want me." 

"Then why not — " 

She seemed almost embarrassed. "I don't know just how 
to put it, darling. If it's just me 
you want, when there are so 
many other women, then it's an 
obsession and you ought to see 
an analyst." 

"But I said it wasn't that 
Really, Hilda, this is all very 
damaging to my self-esteem. I'm 
not sure I want to know your objection to me, but I'm afraid I 
must. What is it?" 



She turned still pinker and 
looked away. "It's idiotic, 
George. You probably won't understand it; I don't think I do, 
myself." She turned her face up 
defiantly. "I feel — motherly toward you." 

"Motherly?" he repeated, stunned. "But that's nonsense! You 
wouldn't know how a mother 
feels! None of us would — I mean 
women, of course — any more 
than I know what it's like to feel 
fatherly." 

"But I'm so much older than 
you." 

"Well, who isn't?" 

"You see, I said you wouldn't 
understand," she answered sadly, 
then tugged his arm with sudden 
desperate gaiety toward the bar. 
"Let's forget all this sociological 
argument, George. I want a 
drink." 

So did he, George realized.

SUNLIGHT, divided by the 
prism high in the arched ceiling, struck full on the paintings 
that lined either side of the long, 
curving gallery, and left the center, the moving strip with its 
divans, its cafe tables and chairs, 
in a soft, restful gloom. 

"Here we come around again,** 
said George. "Another of the 
same?" 

Joe Krueger looked at his

empty glass. "Yes, but this 
round's mine. You've been paying for everything." 

"That will complicate tilings, 
though," objected George. "Tell 
you what. You can buy our tickets to the shadow plays tonight." 

As they approached the checker in his little booth, George took 
the green disk with the tab that 
said tom colons and the orange 
and white one that said scotch/ 
soda and stuck them into the clip 
on the table's center pole. 

Around the center pole were 
four illuminated plastic cylinders 
which reeled off the names of the 
paintings as they passed. piCasso, they were saying, mask 

AND BONES, OIL ON CANVAS, 2073. 
TSCHELETCHEW, FLIGHT FORMS 
#6, INK AND CRAYON, 2105. 
SHAHN, INCUBATORS, OIL ON CANVAS. 

"I'd like to see more of his," 
said Joe, looking at the Shahn. 
"His stuff seems more vital than 
most, somehow. More — " He 
hunted for a word, gave it up 
with his usual embarrassed shrug. 

"He's younger," said George. 
"Picasso, Tscheletchew and all 
that bunch were old men when 
the longevity treatment came in. 
They're still turning out the same 
thing, pretty much, that they 
were doing three centuries ago. 
It does get tiresome, I admit, but 
who's interested in art when there 
are other things to do and see? 



We've gone a long way in more 
important directions, if you ask 
me." 

"Oh, yes," said Joe emphatically. 

"Besides, the Culture Commissioner tells them what to turn 
out. Works fine for everybody." 

The serving station came 
around. The white-jacketed waiter stepped neatly aboard, smiled, 
deposited their drinks, and stepped off again. The cylinders announced, RENOIR, BAIGNEUSE, OIL 
ON CANVAS, 1888. 

George stirred his drink moodily. Joe was now watching the 
paintings attentively,' and he felt 
free to let his thoughts wander. 
After Hilda had gone home last 
night — not with George, worse 
luck! — the four of them had 
gathered in the study again for 
a council of war. This time it had 
been Morey Stiles who had led 
the discussion. He had pointed 
out that the project couldn't possibly be managed on a small 
scale, that in spite of the danger 
they had to have an organization. He was right, of course; 
after all, they'd need an enormous staff who would have to 
know what was going on, not to 
mention the several thousands of 
women who would have to be 
persuaded to give birth. 

Luther, warming to the problem, had been all for secret meetings in basements, and an elab

orate organization based on the 
ancient Communist system. He 
had been voted down. The plan, 
as they finally evolved it, centered around doctors — specialists 
in women's complaints, for preference — who were to be recruited 
and sworn in by Levinson. It 
would be their job to test their 
patients for fertility, carefully 
sound out the pick of the lot, and 
recruit them in turn. Meanwhile 
Morey, as the team's best administrator, would be drawing up 
plans for the birth centers, inspecting locations, bribing officials, and so on. Luther, who had 
the widest acquaintance among 
monied men, would scout for 
more capital. 

There had seemed to be nothing left for George to do but to 
pony up when required and to 
keep his mouth shut. Levinson 
had told him, however, that there 
would ultimately have to be a 
somewhat risky attempt to reach 
the public, and George, because 
of his youth and daring, would 
be very valuable in that phase 
of the conspiracy. When? Levinson didn't know. 

And Hilda, who had only just 
got into town, was off again to 
some mysterious destination for 
an unspecified length of time. 

Anyhow, he had Joe to feel superior to; he ought to be grateful for that. He felt mildly 
ashamed of himself when he 



glanced at the man and saw the 
eagerness in his face. Perhaps 
that was the answer to the question of ennui, he thought — get 
yourself knocked on the head, or 
have your memories surgically 
excised somehow, and start all 
over again. 

That wasn't such a foolish idea 
as it might seem, he told himself. 
After all, nobody knew yet what 
real longevity was like; nobody 
was older than three or four centuries. What would happen when 
they were all three thousand or 
more? 

There was plenty of time to 
worry about it, at least. 

He said, "I'm sorry, I wasn't 
listening." 

Joe repeated, "I've been reading histories like mad, but I can't 
seem to take it all in. Things are 
so much the same, in some ways, 
and yet so different." He shook 
his head. "I suppose I'm trying 
to get it too fast." 

"Well, there isn't exactly any 
rush," said George cheerfully. 
"Anything in particular bothering you?" 

"No children, chiefly, I guess. 
It's hard for me to understand 
how that could possibly be enforced. In my day, population 
was always increasing to meet 
the available food supply; it was 
supposed to be some kind of 
natural law. And now you've 
stopped it cold." 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN

"Had to," said George. "You 
see, the fellows who perfected the 
longevity techniques published 
their work, and the newspapers 
too!: it up, and the thing got completely out of control in the next 
fifty years. Normal birth rate — 
higher, as a matter of fact — and 
the death rate way down. That 
was the time of the big blowup 
— famines, riots, and the Last 
War on top of it. When we came 
out of that, we had three things: 
longevity, a strong world government, and a greatly improved 
birth control technique. Those 
pills, you know, that everybody 
has to take. 

"Well, what else was there to 
do? They had to cut down the 
birth rate, at least, or in a century 
or so we would have been standing on each other's shoulders. 
And that would have been unenforceable, you know — restricted breeding. You can't tell 
anybody that he's not as fit as 
the next man to have children. 
So they stopped it altogether, 
made childbirth a capital crime. 
As a result, the total population 
has shrunk a good deal in the 
last three hundred years, but 
we're still over what's regarded 
as the optimum figure. Or so they 
say." 

"How do you mean?" 

"Well, restricted breeding is an 
awfully hot potato. We'll have to 
come to it eventually, but I don't 



think anybody in the government 
is happy about the prospect. If 
we started reproducing in any 
quantity, the whole economic 
balance would be upset. Tremendously complicated problem. 
I don't know enough about it to 
explain to you properly." 

"I should think it would be 
particularly hard on the women," 
said Joe thoughtfully. 

"Well, there were a lot of people, men and women both, who 
couldn't adjust to longevity it-* 
self, let alone the other problems. 
In the first century after the war, 
I understand suicide accounted 
for something like fifteen per 
cent of the death rate. Looking 
at it from one angle, that was a 
good thing for the race. I mean 
to say, if a person has any fundamental instability, it's going to 
come out in two centuries or less. 
And people for whom there 
simply wasn't any room in the 
society. Without children consuming and not producing, you 
know, our production rate is 
enormously higher. There was a 
lot of unemployment, too, in that 
first century. Some starvation, 
I'm afraid. And crime waves. But 
that's all settled down now, and 
as you see we have a very stable 
setup, and a high living standard. 
That's why it's going to be so 
difficult to change when we have 
to." 

"Umm," said Joe, seriously. 



It 



GALAXY SCIENCI FICTION 



It occurred to George that he 
had been talking rather seriously 
himself, not exactly the best line 
to take for a man with knowledge 
he was supposed to conceal. He 
smiled cheerfully and said, "But 
I don't think anybody should 
work up an ulcer over it just yet. 
You can generally lick a problem 
if you have a few thousand years 
to mull it over." 

Joe nodded enthusiastically. 
"That's one of the things that 
awes me, whenever I think about 
it. In the old days — I mean, in 
my day — " He shook his head. "I 
keep getting my terms of reference mixed up. Anyhow, it used 
to be that a man could learn 
enough to do what he wanted 
to do by the time he was thirty, 
and then his life was half done. 
Now—" He looked baffled. "It's 
hard to take in. Tell me, Miss 
Place said something about rocket flights to the stars—?" 

"Oh, yes. They got to the 
Moon in 1954. That must have 
been a year or two after you 
blanked out. Mars in 1961, I 
think it was, and Venus the year 
after. Moons of Jupiter in 1969. 
All uninhabitable, of course." 

"Yes, but I meant interstellar 
flights?" 

■■"JUST one. Alpha Centauri, 
•I along about the turn of the 

eentury. The trip took something 
like six years each way, I under


stand. They found a very Earthlike planet, and I believe there's 
some talk of putting a small colony there." 

"Lord!" said Joe Krueger. "But 
—all this time, and they haven't 
done anything more about it?" 

"Well, it's really a hobbyist's 
kind of thing," said George 
thoughtfully. "A good many people, with more time and more 
capital to play with, have turned 
to space-flight who wouldn't have 
been much involved with it before. But it hasn't any economic 
base, you see. No really urgent 
reason for anyone to tackle it." 

"That's what I don't get," said 
Joe, creasing his brow into an anxious frown. "Wouldn't it solve 
the problem we were just talking 
about?" 

"It might, at that," said 
George, trying valiantly to see 
the question from the other man's 
viewpoint. "But it hasn't come to 
that yet, and probably won't for 
a good long time. As things stand, 
human life is a very precious 
thing, much more than it was 
even in the Western countries in 
your day. That's understandable, 
isn't it? It's like betting at roulette — if you haven't got much to 
lose, you may as well risk it all; 
but if you've got a lot, you're a 
fool to gamble it away. So that's 
one reason we don't have war— 
another argument against breeding that I forgot to mention — and

we play a good deal of tennis 
and squash and so on, but no 
football; and we're not anxious to 
risk our necks on exploring expeditions. You had something in 
mind like the colonization of the 
Amazon basin and so on, didn't 
you?" 

Joe nodded. "All habitable 
areas." 

"Not the same thing, though 
■ — we have no population pressure, no economic pressure. Things 
are good here for everybody. Why 
should anybody want to leave? 
There's more room in the Americas, but I like Europe and who 
needs more room just for himself?" 

Joe grinned wryly. "I see it — 
in theory, anyhow. But I'm 
damned if I feel that way about 
it. Me, I'd like to go." 

"I'll see if I can wangle an introduction to Clarke, the Rocket 
Society high lama. Luther knows 
him, I think." 

Joe was saying, "That would 
be wonderful," when George's 
wrist phone buzzed. He said, 
"Excuse me," and swiveled the 
disk into his palm so that the receiver covered his ear and the 
transmitter pickup touched his 
throat, making eavesdropping 
impossible. 

"George Miller," he said. 

"George, this is Art Levinson,** 
said the tiny voice rapidly. "I'm 
about to be arrested by the Se


curity Police. I tried to reach the 
others, but they're both out of 
phone range." 

"The Security — that's impossible," George protested. "We 
haven't done a thing. They 
couldn't know!" 

"I told you I spoke to Van 
Dam, the Public Health Commissioner," said the voice impatiently. "He must have figured 
I'd do something about the sterility situation, so he evidently 
had my rooms wired and put a 
detail of police on my trail. 
Everything we said in our conference must be on official tapes.** 

"Good God!" George exclaimed. "Then we're all in 
danger!" 

"Of course. Don't tell me you 
haven't got anybody trailing 
you." 

George glanced around apprehensively. Everybody suddenly 
looked suspicious, but there was 
no one he could specifically identify as a Security Policeman. 

"I don't know," he said. 
"Where are you?" 

"In Luther's bedroom. I locked 
myself in. They're trying to break 
the door down. Good-by, George. 
Just pass the word along. That's 
all you can — " 

"Hold on! How long can you 
keep them out of there?" 

"Another few minutes, if that. 
Don't try to do anything foolish, 
George. There's another of them 



20 




 



in a 'copter outside the bedroom 
window. Just tell — " 

"Wait!" said George excitedly. 
"Hold them off as long as you 
can. Throw a fit. Do anything." 
He broke the contact and said to 
Joe's astonished face, "Something 
urgent. Pay the check for me, 
will you? I'll call you later." 

He fumbled a bill out of his 
wallet, stood up and leaped off 
the moving strip, dashing past 
indignant patrons of the arts to 
the roof exit. 

Thoughts blurred in his head. 
He didn't know what he could 
do, but he intended to do something. He couldn't let Levinson 
stand off the police by himself. 
The excitement was somehpw 
pleasant — the adrenalin squirting 
through his veins, his chest filling massively with air, his shoulders knotting with the expectation of a fight. It was astonishing. 
He couldn't think of anyone who 
wouldn't avoid danger at absolutely any cost: with his conditioning, it was hard to believe 
that he was being so foolhardy. 

Yet George felt rather proud 
of himself. He'd wondered why 
Levinson had included him in the 
original tiny group of conspirators, had resignedly assumed it 
was actually because of his 
money. Now he knew at least 
part of the reason and respected 
Levinson's shrewdness. 

He was, he thought quickly, 



about two minutes away from 
Luther's apartment by air — if he 
could get a cab. 

The roof was crowded with 
private 'copters, and for a moment George debated the idea of 
stealing one. Impossible. They 
were all stowed in parking clips, 
and he couldn't get one out past 
the attendant anyhow, even if 
some fool had left his keys in the 
dashboard console. He ran on, 
reaching the cab section just in 
time to see a red-and-green 'copter lifting away. He thought it 
was empty, but he couldn't be 
sure. 

He shouted futilely, then 
swung his wrist-radio out, dialed 
it to "Directional" and sighted 
carefully at the rising 'copter. 
After a long moment the instrument clicked and said, "Signor?" 
The cab steadied and hovered. 

"Down here," said George. 
"Where you just came from — the 
Modern Museum." Apparently 
he had lost the contact, for the 
'copter hung annoy ingly' where 
it was. Then he could see the tiny 
dot that was the driver's head. 
He waved madly, and in a moment the cab settled back to the 
landing stage. 

George piled in and said, "Get 
up — quick." As the 'copter lifted 
again, the driver's mustachioed 
face turned to regard him quizzically. He said, "The Penaldo 
Building on the Rio S. Polo. You

know the place I mean?" 

"Surely, signor." 

"Then hurry, will you?" 
George waved a hundred-lira 
note, on second thought added 
another. The -driver's eyebrows 
went up the merest trifle; philosophically, he headed the machine into the northbound traffic 
level and fed power to the rotors. 

George looked anxiously at his 
phone. He didn't have Art's call 
number, worse luck. But if they 
had already broken down the 
door when he got there, he'd 
know soon enough. He forced 
himself to relax, then exploded 
into motion the next instant as 
the cab settled on the Penaldo 
Building's roof. He thrust the 
money at the driver, shouted, 
"Good work, thanks!" and ran 
across the roof to the canal -side 
parapet. 

He looked back once to make 
sure that the cab had taken off, 
then peered cautiously over the 
parapet. There was the police 
'copter, sure enough, hovering 
outside the window of Luther's 
top-floor bedroom. Underneath, 
five stories down, a white gondola 
was rocking in the surge of a 
small power boat. The gondolier's 
ancient automatic curses drifted 
faintly up to him. 

Now what? He had had a 
Vague notion that if he could 
eliminate the 'copter somehow, he 
could get Art out through the 



window before the other Security 
men broke in. But eliminating the 
'copter looked tough now, if not 
impossible. 

He risked another look. There 
was only one man in the 'copter; 
that was a point in his favor, 
though he wasn't sure how. But 
just to begin with, he couldn't 
attract the man's attention by 
shouting; he'd never be heard 
over the noise of the 'copters 
rotors. And he couldn't very well 
show himself. As for the phone — 

Wait a minute! The police 
would almost certainly be talking to each other by phone; in 
fact, he was positive of it. And 
these small transmitters didn't reproduce intonations very well. It 
could work. Anyway — 

George aimed the phone carefully at the man in the 'copter 
and said briskly, "On the roof! 
Quick!" Then he ducked out of 
the man's visual range and 
watched the rotor blades. When 
they began to rise, he leaped 
away from the parapet and got 
behind the stairway entrance. 

The door was open, and George 
could hear muffled banging 
sounds down the corridor. Good 
for Art, he thought abstractedly; 
he must have piled furniture 
against the door. 

He looked around the corner 
of the entrance and saw the 'copter's tail level with the parapet. 
Instantly he faced the other way.

put his palm against the door 
frame and shoved himself violently backward. 

He toppled out into yiew, legs 
going furiously to try to keep his 
balance; then he let himself go 
and landed with a bone-crushing 
thump on the hard roof. He 
scrambled to his feet again, drew 
an imaginary knife from his 
jacket, and lunged back behind 
the entrance. 

There was a' thump as the 
'copter landed on the roof, and 
then footsteps pounded toward 
him. George ducked around the 
opposite side of the entrance and 
ran silently, on the balls of his 
feet, completely around to the 
blind side again. 

The policeman, a depressingly 
burly young man in pearl-gray 
jacket and shorts, was leaning 
half into the doorway, listening 
to the sounds from down the 
hall. Without hesitation, George 
launched himself at his back. 

They tottered a moment. Then 
the policeman's grip was torn 
away and they plunged together 
down the stairs. They landed 
with a jar that shook George 
from skull to knees. He sorted 
himself out and saw that the 
young policeman was also getting 
up, with a dazed expression on 
his face. George hit him on the 
point of the jaw, as hard as he 
could. The policeman collapsed 
and slid down another four steps. 



Panting, George slid down beside him and took his gun. He 
could still hear the pounding 
down the hall. Evidently the 
others hadn't heard the crash 
when they came down the stairs, 
though it had sounded loud 
enough to wake a regiment. 

George hit the recumbent policeman thoughtfully behind the 
ear with the butt of his gun. He 
would have liked to get him out 
of the way, but strongly doubted 
his own ability to lug that steakfed hulk any distance. He went 
back up the stairs, past the idling 
'copter, to the parapet again. 

It was a good fifteen feet down 
to the window and no way to get 
there. He couldn't take the 'copter down and simply invite Art 
to climb in; the rotor blades 
wouldn't have enough clearance. 

Swearing to himself, George 
ran back to the "copter and rummaged inside it. In a locker just 
forward of the door, he found a 
rope ladder. But it took him what 
seemed like five anguished minutes to locate the hooks — diabolically hidden over the door inside the cab — which were designed to support it. 

He climbed in and took the 
'copter up, past the parapet and 
over, dangerously close, letting 
the ladder dangle against the 
window. For another agonizing 
interval, nothing happened. 
George was about to haul the 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN 



ladder up again and tie a wrench 
to it, when the window suddenly 
swung open and Art's red, wildeyed face appeared. 

George leaned out and gestured 
wildly. Art nodded, grasped the 
ladder, and swung precariously 
out into space. 

George hovered carefully until 
Art was halfway in. Then he took 
the 'copter up and away in a 
wild swoop that nearly made Art 
fall out again. 

Art closed the door and jackknifed himself into the tiny space 
to right of the pilot's seat. When 
he got his breath back, he said, 
"Thanks." 

"Don't mention it," 'said 
George. "Did they want you very 
badly, Art?" 

"Afraid so. Didn't give them 
a chance to tell me. Ducked into 
the bedroom and locked the door 
when I saw them." He took a 
deep breath and smiled. "Where 
to now?" 

George felt an unexpected glow 
of satisfaction. Imagine anyone 
asking him what to do next! 

"I'm looking for an empty 
landing stage," he said. "We'll 
ditch the 'copter there, and then 
get ourselves as thoroughly lost 
as we can." 

Ill 

rpHEY left the 'copter on th« 
roof of a theater building and 
■topped at th* nearest public 



phone booth to try to reach Luther and Morey. Both were still 
out of range. Then they went 
looking for a suitable hiding 
place for Art. 

In Venice — in any modern city 
—there were a million places to 
get very thoroughly lost. There 
were discreet apartment houses, 
residence hotels, 'copter courts— 
and there were the vice houses, 
George, knowing Art's staid habits, chose one of the latter. The 
police would also know Art and 
might not look there. 

For the benefit of those with 
scruples or reputations, entrance 
to the house was by way of a 
series of little cubicles lining one 
side of an arcade. The other side 
was rented to a group of secondrate but bona fide shops. Having 
inspected the merchandise displayed there and assured himself 
that no acquaintances were lurking in the corridor, a prospective 
client could simply step across 
into the nearest vacant cubicle 
and shut the door. Inside, a polite 
voice from a wall speaker asked 
to be allowed to learn your 
wishes, registered you under any 
name you chose to give, and allotted you a room, a suite, a wing 
or a floor according to your 
wishes and your pocketbook. 

George, speaking German with 
a thick and slightly drunken 
Munschener accent, affected hesitation and asked for a resume of 



• A I A XT SCIENCE FICTION 



the house's attractions. The invisible clerk immediately switched 
to impeccable Low German and 
suggested, "The Herren would 
possibly like to inspect -the ladies 
in one of the private salons before making a choice? Or perhaps one of the theaters first? Or 
if the Herren require any stimulation — ?" He proceeded to describe some of the entertainments 
now being offered in the theaters, 
and to name the various species 
of stimulants that were available 
to clients. 

"No," said George fuzzily. 
"Later, later. We are already too 
drunk. Give us just a room — no, 
a suite. The best." 

"Certainly. Sixty lira, please." 
George put the notes into the slot 
in the counter. A receipt and two 
door keys popped out, and the 
right wall of the cubicle rolled 
back to reveal a tiny self-service 
elevator. "Suite C 35," said the 
clerk. "Turn right when you 
leave the elevator." 

The suite was eminently comfortable: three bedrooms, two 
baths, living room, game room, 
and even a tiny gymnasium; but 
Art grumbled. "Dammit, George, 
I suppose I shouldn't complain 
when you've just saved my neck, 
but I can't see your sense of 
humor. Anyway, what are these 
people going to think when I. keep 
staying here but don't have any 
women up?" 



* "Probably think we're queer," 
George suggested. Then, as Art 
seemed about to explode, he 
added hastily. "It'll be good for 
you, Art — teach you humility 
and not condemning your fellow 
man and so forth. Anyhow, 
you've got to admit it's safe." 

"All right," said Art, brushing 
the subject aside. "Listen, do you 
have any idea where Luther and 
Morey might be, or when they're 
due back?" 

"Not the faintest," George admitted. "Luther has his cat farm 
up near Turino — he might have 
gone there — but he might just as 
easily have run over to Praha or 
even Wembley for a couple of 
days. Morey might have gone 
back to North America — I hope 
so— but in any case I don't see 
how we can risk a 'gram without 
giving the whole show away." , 

"No," agreed Art. He scowled 
and bit his lip. "Just the same, 
we've got to locate them. I have 
a hunch the S. P. is just as anxious to find them as we are." 

George lifted one eyebrow. 
"You think they're clairvoyant?" 

"No. I think that up till an 
hour ago, Golightly's crowd took 
me just seriously enough to want 
me out of the way. But since 
you've pulled that televisionserial act with the 'copter, I'm 
willing to bet that they're seriously alarmed. I told you they 
must have our meeting on tape. 




 



so they'll know Luther and 
Morey are involved. You, too, of 
course." 

George sat down on the edge 
of a large, circular divan, upholstered in aphrodisia red. He said 
thoughtfully, "Well, what do we 
do? If we all run, then we'll just 
be advertising our whereabouts, 
won't we?" 

Art nodded grimly v "But if the 
S. P. gets hold of any of the four 
of us, I wouldn't give much for 
our chances of seeing daylight 
again." 

George stared at him. "I suppose I'm naive, but it seems to 
me that you're implying they'll 
use illegal methods — truth serum 
and so on." 

"I think they will," Art said 
positively. "George, you were 
born into this society, so I 
wouldn't expect you to realize, 
emotionally, just how unstable it 
really is. You've read about the 
series of religious wars that followed the big blowup, and the 
Asian massacres, but I suppose 
it's never occurred to you that 
that kind of thing could happen 
again. It could, and nobody 
knows if better than Golightly. 
By education and technology 
and, let's face it, by the execution of everybody who really 
objected, this planet has been 
forced to keep its birth-rate at 
zero. But the urge to reproduce, 
next to the survival instinct, is 



one of the strongest forces in nature. Tilt the balance of control 
just enough, and Golightly's government would go over like a 
house of cards. And just incidentally, Golightly is about as 
paranoid as you can get without 
being locked up. I know the man. 
He'll do anything to keep himself 
in the driver's seat." 

George felt himself going a 
trifle pale. He said, "In that case, 
I suppose I'd better get busy. 
I'll call every place they could 
possibly be. You stay here, Art. 
I'll come back and report as soon 
as I can." 

He found a public booth in the 
concourse nearby, and spent an 
expensive twenty minutes trying 
to locate Morey at his headquarters in Des Moines, and Luther at 
Turino, Praha, Wembley and 
points in between. 

Gloomily, he called Art at the 
vice house, using the name he 
had given in registering. "No luck 
so far," he said in German. "See 
here, have you looked at the fax 
or the video newscasts?" 

"Yes. Nothing of interest 
there." 

"Do you think they may have 
been found already?" 

"It's possible," said Art's earnest voice, "but I think it's unlikely. Anyone like those two is 
terribly hard to track down at a 
moment's notice, as you are finding out. If we can get them! 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN

within the next few hours, I think 
We'll be in time. Keep trying." 

George rang off and sat thinking for a moment. Actually, the 
possible number of places where 
either Luther or Morey might be 
at this moment included everything within a day's flight from 
Venice, meaning the major part of 
Earth's surface. If he kept on 
calling relay stations at random, 
it might easily take him days to 
hit the right one. There had to be 
a quicker way. 

How about the agony columns 
In the Telefax papers? George 
considered the probable cost 
briefly, and whistled softly to 
himself. Another difficulty was 
that it would mean showing his 
hand; the S. P. would almost certainly see the messages, whether 
Luther and Morey did or not. But 
he could think of no other an■wer. 

He plucked a doodle-sheet 
from the pad fixed to the wall of 
the booth, and set down a rough 
draft of the message. Dissatisfied, 
he scratched it out and tried 
•gain. After six attempts, he had : 

WORLD FATHERS OF VERMONT AND LOUISIANA: Serious charges have been leveled 
against revered Father Owl of 
California. Abandon your worldly 
identities immediately and fly to 
consult with your brethren. The 
meeting will assemble in the place 
€>f the Drowned Insect. 

It sounded silly enough, he 



hoped, to pass as an ordinary notice intended for one of the innumerable crackpot sects which had 
sprung up after the power of the 
organized churches had been 
crushed. He couldn't make it 
more specific, but he hoped "Vermont and Louisiana" would serve 
to attract Luther's and Morey's 
attention — the name of a man's 
home state will usually stand out 
from a page of type almost as 
well as his own name — and 
"World Fathers" and "Father 
Owl of California" would t make 
the identification certain. 

The last line was a long shot. 
He had to indicate a meeting 
place without naming it; "the^ 
place of the Drowned Insect" 
was a restaurant in Venice where 
the three of them, a few years 
before, had. been served a tureen 
of soup with a dead cockroach 
floating in the center of it. Also, 
he had to tell them to assume 
false names, and if possible get 
across the idea that they were to 
disguise themselves. Here dgain, 
he couldn't be too explicit; 
"abandon your worldly identities" was the best he could think 
of. 

When he read it over, it seemed 
like a forlorn hope either that the 
two men would see the notice or 
that they would read it correctly. 
But he took the slidewalk down 
to the nearest fax agency and 
fed the message into a machine, 



it 




 



adding the code numbers for all 
the local papers served by the 
Mediterranean Agency, which 
covered southern and eastern 
Europe, part of what had once 
been the Soviet Union and most 
of North Africa. 

The cost was approximately 
two hundred times the amount of 
cash he was carrying, and this 
worried him until he reflected 
that he was undoubtedly on the 
S. P. list, if Art was right ; there 
was no point in trying to conceal 
his tracks. He wrote a check and 
fed it into the machine. 

While he waited for its acknowledgment, he set up the same 
message on another machine and 
coded it for the PanAmerican 
Syndicate. He went through the 
same procedure twice more, once 
for the North Atlantic Agency 
and once for the All-Asia Syndicate. 

When he was finished, his Venetian bank account was in a 
state of near collapse. 

The bank itself was only a few 
blocks away, near the Rialto 
bridge. As an afterthought, he 
went there and closed out his account, pocketing the cash. It had 
occurred to him that, again supposing that Art was right, the 
government would very likely 
impound their property. He 
wished he had included a suggestion of this kind in the message to Luther and Morey, but 



it was too late to worry about it. 

He went back to the vice hoUse, 
conferred with Art, and then took 
himself to "the Place of the 
Drowned Insect." 

The restaurant was an oldfashioned one, catering to those 
who liked human service well 
enough to pay the almost astronomical prices imposed by the 
waiters' salaries. At that, George 
noticed, the place was understaffed. In another century or so, 
he supposed, nobody would be 
able to hire any kind of servant 
for less than a division chief's 

payHe found an inconspicuous 
table at the rear, ordered minestrone and spaghetti marinara, 
and waited. When the spaghetti 
gave out, he ordered a half bottle 
of claret. He made the wine last 
as long as he could, then bought 
a newspaper at the fax machine 
across the room and ordered another half -bottle. 

He checked to make sure his 
ad had been eptered properly, 
read the paper through, and then, 
through sheer boredom, read it 
completely through again. He 
was beginning to feel awash with 
wine, and the waiter was glancing at him with obvious irritation each time he passed. George 
caught his eye and ordered a pastry and coffee. When that was 
gone, he ordered more coffee. 
Then he went back to wine.

Eventually it became impossible to think of taking another sip 
of the stuff. George sat and stared 
glassily at the half-empty bottle, 
wondering why he had not had 
the God-given sense to make the 
meeting place a library, or an 
opium den, or anything at all except a restaurant. 

"Came as soon as I could," said 
Luther's voice. "What's up?" 

George looked around with 
enormous relief to see the little 
man easing into the chair opposite. 

"Luther!" he said. "I couldn't 
be gladder to see you V He smothered a belch. "You haven't gone 
back .to your apartment, have 
you?" 

"No, of course not. Why?" 

"Don't. According to Art, we're 
•11 about two jumps away from 
jail. Where were you, and how 
did you come back?" 

"In Milano. I wanted to see a 
man there who claimed he had a 
new strain of Abyssinians. Came 
back by plane, the same way I 
Went up. Why?" 

"Good Lord," said George. 
■*You were lucky they didn't nab 
you at the airport. All right, the 
next thing is, give me checks for 
any funds you've got in Venetian 
banks. Wait a minute. First, do 
you have any idea where Morey 
■night be?" 

"Marseilles, I think. Now 
why — " 



George stood up somewhat unsteadily. "I'll try to call him 
there while you're writing the 
checks. Don't order anything till 
I get back." 

He returned in a moment. "No 
luck. Either he's on the way back, 
or you were mistaken. Got the 
checks?" 

"Yes. Here. But listen, George, 
take pity on my ignorance, will 
you? What's happened to Art? 
Why do you want all my money? 
I feel as if I'd come in at the 
second act." 

"I'll explain it all to you later 
or Art will. Oh, damn!" He looked 
at his watch. "The banks are 
closed, aren't they?" He tore up 
the three slips of paper Luther 
had handed him and stuffed the 
fragments in his pocket. "Well, 
look. Art is in the Hotel Scato on 
the Ruza Vecchia, Suite C 35. 
Speak German and ask for Herr 
Bauernfeind — that's the name I 
gave when I registered. You go on 
up there as fast as you can, but 
use the slidewalks; don't take a 
'copter. I'll stay here — " George 
looked unhappily at the wine bottle — "and wait till Morey shows 
up, or the place closes." 

Luther stood up. "All right. 
Look, though, if Morey is on the 
way here, and if he started about 
when I did, he might be within 
phone range by now. Why don't 
you try calling him again?" 

George clutched at the idea. "I

• ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



will. Wait for me." He went to the 
booth again and dialed Morey's 
number. 

A voice said, "This is Stiles." 

George sighed happily. He said, 
"George, Morey. How long will 
it take you to get here? . . . You 
saw the ad? . . . Good. I'll meet 
you outside." 

AN hour later they were all together in Art's suite, listening 
to a video newscaster announce, 
"The following persons are wanted by the Security Police for 
questioning in connection with a 
conspiracy against the peace. 
Please memorize these names and 
pictures. If you see one of these 
persons, communicate immediately with your local S. P. office. 
Arthur Benjamin Levinson, age 
341; residence, Pasadena, California; profession, geneticist. Luther Wallace Wheatley, age 357; 
residences in Venice, Mexico City 
and Caulfield, Vermont; independently wealthy." Three more 
pictures and descriptions of Luther's friends appeared, then 
George's. Morey was far down 
the list, which was a long one. 

"They'll narrow it down," said 
Art Levinson. "In a couple of 
days, at the most, they'll have 
located all but the four of us. 
Then you'll really see a fox hunt." 

Morey's long face was gloomy. 
"It don't look good, Art. If you 
want my opinion, we're licked." 



"I didn't say the fox hunt 
would succeed," Levinson said. 
"We can slip the hounds and, as 
long as we're free, we have a 
chance to get our program 
across." 

Morey shook his head. "Maybe 
you got some reason to be optimistic, but I don't see it. We've 
got to throw out all the plans 
we've made so far, ain't that 
right?" 

"Yes." 

"Well, then, will you tell me 
what in blazes we can do? How 
much money have we got between us?" 

They counted up. George had 
a little over two thousand international credits, Art four hundred, Luther not quite a thousand, and Morey, surprisingly, 
five thousand. 

"It's union money," he said 
glumly. "If we spend it, that's 
one more crime chalked up 
against us. Not that it'll matter. 
Anyhow, we got just short of 
eighty-three hundred credits. 
How far can we get with that?" 

"Not very far — if we run," said 
Art. "If we run, they'll catch us. 
I think we can take that as a 
mathematical certainty. That disposes of one of the three alternatives we have, as I see it." 

"The other two being?" asked 
Luther. 

"We can give ourselves up,** 
said Art. "Or we can fight. It may 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN 



31 



seem funny, but I honestly think 
the safest thing we can do — supposing for a minute that we're 
just interested in saving our necks 
— is to fight. Or let's say to resist. The other two ways are the 
next thing to suicide." 

Art's round face was flushed 
with enthusiasm. Luther was 
smiling quietly, and there was a 
faint gleam even in Morey's pale 
eye. George felt a trifle left out. 
He had an absurd picture of the 
four of them behind a barricade, 
doing battle with an endless 
swarm of policemen. 

"Somebody explain this to me, 
will you?" he asked plaintively. 

"He's too young to remember," 
said Luther kindly. "Tell the boy, 
Art." 

Art leaned forward earnestly, 
and unconsciously the three 
hitched themselves forward a little in their chairs. 

"George, you probably haven't 
read much about the two socalled 'World Wars' that preceded the Last War, because in 
historical perspective they were 
only a sort of preliminary. But 
during the second one, when Germany had overrun most of Europe, there was a thing called the 
Resistance. An underground 
movement. Their situation was 
very much like ours — they didn't 
have enough of an organization 
to attack openly, or even defend 
themselves openly. But they did 



what they could — sabotage, espionage, propaganda, and some 
guerrilla warfare. In effect, they 
made themselves one hell of a 
nuisance to the Germans. We can 
do the same thing." 

"There were more than four of 
them, though, weren't there?" 
George asked. 

Art said, "An analogy is just 
an analogy, George, not an identity. As it happens, Golightly's 
government has one serious disadvantage that the Germans 
didn't have. The Germans were 
a frankly oppressive group to begin with, operating to the full extent of their power. Golightly's 
crowd can'/ fight even a small 
resistance group — and we'll grow, 
don't worry — without assuming 
the characteristics of a tyranny. 
And, George, this planet simply 
isn't weak enough or sick enough, 
economically and politically, to 
hold still for a tyrant. 

"This present group has been 
continuously in power for more 
than two centuries, and there isn't 
one of the inner circle that 
wouldn't like to extend their 
power. But we've still got a democracy. Why? Because they 
haven't got a power concept behind them. They've kept office 
all this time because they're the 
best administrators and practical 
politicians on the planet, and 
that's all. If they stop acting in 
the people's interest — which 



»2 




 



they've already done — and if 
enough of the people find out 
about it — which they will — their 
goose is cooked." 

"This is revolution you're talkin' about," said Morey gently. "A 
lot of people're going to get hurt." 

"I know it," replied Art, looking grimly unhappy. "Show me 
another way, Morey, and I'll 
grab it." 

"This is just for the record, so 
to speak," Morey said. "There's 
an election coming up in eighteen months. We might be able to 
hook up with Golightly's opposition and get them in." 

Luther snorted. "Di Falco? 
That man is the eternal disappointed candidate." 

"And," said Art, "we can't wait 
eighteen months. All right?" 

"Grant the point," agreed Morey reluctantly. 

"Okay. .Here's a tentative list 
of tactics I've made up. You'll 
notice that I've tried to put the 
emphasis on things that will provoke the government into illegal 
and, if possible, violent acts. It's 
like ju-jitsu — we've got to make 
them use their own strength 
against themselves." 

"Let's see that," said Morey, 
with such enthusiasm that the 
other three stared at him. "It's 
been a long time since a union 
man had to hit below the belt, 
but I remember a few tricks, can 
dig up more from the old books, 



and maybe invent some of my 
own." 

IV 

' | ^HERE was an underworld, of 
course; no society, however 
perfect, had completely rehabilitated or absorbed the maladjusted who had either too much 
power drive or not enough, the 
bitter rebels and the passively defeated, those who wouldn't conform and those who couldn't. la 
ethical societies, the underworld 
had consisted of criminal and political malcontents, while harsh 
tyrannies had suppressed the 
honest. 

George had been vaguely aware 
of the underworld, but he had 
never, as far as he knew, encountered any of its denizens. Now, 
guided by Morey and Levinson, 
who had maintained cautious 
contact with it, he found that he 
had unsuspectingly been quite 
friendly with a number of people on the Security Police's gray 
list. 

The strange thing was that he 
had always previously considered 
these daring semi-criminals the 
worst bores he knew. 

There was the Thanatopsii 
Club, for instance. Levinson had 
arranged to have George addresa 
them in secret session, and George 
switched cabs, doubled back several times, skittered through al

leys while looking fearfully over 
his shoulder — and ended in a dismal suburban house belonging to 
Elbert Maxwell, the ornithologist. 

It was a very tense gathering 
in the living room. Carlotta Speranza was there, a small unattractive bibliographer with a sharp 
and peering face, who could talk 
your ear off about ancient literature; Kurt Lustgarten, the philosopher, whose flabbily intense 
features had backed George into 
more corners at parties than he 
liked to remember; Paavo Atterberg, the musicologist, whom 
George had been more successful 
at evading, generally because Atterberg could be easily maneuvered to a piano; and other similarly intense people, with eager, 
hungry eyes and nervous hands, 
who were unfamiliar to George. 

Elbert Maxwell saw him look 
puzzledly at the TV screen, which 
was writhing with some frantic 
dance in full color, and the pair 
of drinks each person was holding 
grimly, and the flimsy costumes 
they wore. 

"Camouflage,'* Maxwell explained, giving a shrill, anxious 
laugh. "If the police raid us — 
which has happened a couple of 
times; we're all suspected of dangerous cultural activities, you 
know — why, we're simply having 
an innocent vice party." 

"I see," said George, confused. 
"When do I speak? I have sev


eral more addresses to make tonight." 

Maxwell glanced at a card he 
was holding. "Well, we'll try to 
move you up on the agenda, but 
I'm afraid you picked a bad 
night — there's a great deal of 
business to be done at this meeting." 

George took the two antagonistic drinks that were handed him 
and sat down to listen patiently 
until his turn came. He was aware 
of his own tension. He was pretty 
sure he'd thrown off any possible 
shadows, but he couldn't know 
whether the others present had 
been as clever. They certainly 
didn't look it. At any moment, 
the house might be stormed and 
this pathetic attempt to make a 
criminal underground meeting 
seem like a mere orgy wouldn't 
fool the police. 

Maxwell, pretending to watch 
the TV screen, told the gathering 
that two more species of bird had 
become extinct in the last decade, 
and at least six others were in 
danger, with the government, as 
usual, threatening any attempt to 
save them. The listeners showed 
every emotion from horror to 
rage. George tried to feel upset 
about the situation, but couldn't. 
It wasn't that he disliked birds; 
he just thought it was their problem, not his. Maxwell's motion to 
set up secret bird sanctuaries was 
carried, and George felt an emo

tionat response for the first time 
— at the amount of money they 
agreed to raise for the project. 

Carlotta Speranza, talking passionately about the decline of 
literature, didn't bother pretending to watch the TV show. She 




wanted an ambitious program begun immediately — undercover 
writing classes, printing plants 
and distribution channels. Lustgarten objected that the population had been educated away 
from reading. She added a hitand-run public campaign to her 
program. Maxwell, clearly feeling that all this might cut down 
the funds for his secret aviaries, 
shrewdly tabled the resolution. 



"You can't do this to me!" 
Carlotta shrieked. "Are your 
birds more important to civilization than literature?" 

"Of course not," Maxwell said 
hurriedly. "Everything is important. But we can't do everything 



at the same time." 

"Then put your program aside 
temporarily." 

Maxwell was shocked. "And 
let these species vanish forever?" 

"I think both should be considered by all our colleagues in the 
underworld," said Atterberg, "but 
the main thing is raising money 
to save music." And he tried to 
go into an excited explanation of 
the musical crisis, but Maxwell

3S 



made him wait until his speech 
was scheduled. 

Lustgarten spoke next. George 
tried manfully to listen to his 
statement on problems of philosophy in an indifferent world, but 
developed a headache that had 
to be massaged by a drink. One 
proved insufficient; he took the 
other and opposite drink, which 
acted like an explosive charge to 
the primer of the first one. He 
was silently rooting for one team 
of jet-skaters on TV by the time 
Lustgarten and Atterberg finished 
and it was his turn to talk. 

George managed somehow to 
explain the problem. The others 
listened attentively until it was 
time to take a vote. Then a split 
developed. Lustgarten and Atterberg declared that they were 
personally not involved; they 
didn't care much if humanity 
survived unless, as Atterberg put 
it, there was music in its soul, or 
philosophy and not brainless frivolity, in Lustgarten's words. A 
very tall woman with almost no 
hair on her head, quite a bit on 
her face and military shoulders 
stated that she would rather die 
than submit to breeding. 

Maxwell was in favor, as long 
as the project did not interfere 
with saving birdlife. When Carlotta Speranza unexpectedly 
dropped her own program to support George's, and said, "Birds 
don't create literature, Elbert; 



people do, and we must keep the 
race going to that end," Maxwell 
suddenly changed his mind. 

"If I have to choose between 
birds and humanity," he said bitterly, "I'll take birds every time. 
They never exterminated another 
race of animals! Whereas, what 
has been humanity's record? One 
species after another wiped off 
the planet! Because of viciousness? Greed? At one time, yes — 
the bison and the egret are two 
examples. But the motive today 
is pure lack of interest. We encroached on the habitats of our 
furred and feathered friends until 
they could no longer maintain existence, and so went into the 
limbo of extinct species." 

"Wouldn't happen again,'* 
George argued fuzzily, realizing 
that he was neither articulate nor 
sober enough to overcome Maxwell's notorious literary style. 
"Everybody dies. New generation 
takes place. Not enough people 
to cover Earth. Birds multiply. 
Animals multiply. Educate new 
generation to take care of 'em. 
Teach 'em music and philosophy 
and literature — everything. Solves 
all problems same time." 

"In how many centuries will 
the present population die off?" 
Maxwell demanded. "What happens to animal life in that time? 
Wiped out, sir — wiped out completely! No, I'll let humanity die 
out before I'll allow another spe


GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



cies ever to become extinct!" 

"But voting against the birth 
program won't hasten the end of 
mankind," Carlotta Speranza 
pointed out heatedly. "It will still 
take the same number of centuries before we all die." 

"Abs'lutely right," George 
agreed. 

It didn't change the vote, however. George acquired Carlotta 
and two other women and one 
man who looked singularly unfertile as members of the conspiracy. 

He was told how to get to his 
next appointment, given a few 
more drinks for the road, and, 
though he remembered only a 
blurrily earnest face or two in indistinctly different living rooms, 
he had nearly two dozen signed 
applications to turn over to Levinson in the morning. 

"You've done fine, George," 
Levinson said enthusiastically, 
while George shakily placed a 
hangover capsule on his fuzzcovered tongue. "The organization is under way!" 

"It's awfully hard on the eardrums and the bladder," George 
complained. "Right now, I don't 
feel that saving humanity is 
worth the trouble." 

"You'll learn not to listen," 
said Morey encouragingly. "Even 
to yourself, as a matter of fact. I 
know — I can make any number 
of union speeches without even 



hearing myself. Habit." 

"And all the drinking I have to 
do?" George asked, pulling down 
his lower eyelids to see the engorged veins more clearly. 

"It's free, isn't it? And you can 
carry alcohol-neutralizing tablets 
with you." 

George turned around in horror. "Then where's the fun?" 

V 

GEORGE'S beard itched. He 
had had it for almost a 
month now, but it didn't appear 
that he was ever going to get 
used to it. Or to the wax Art Levinson had injected under the skin 
at the bridge of his nose, to give 
him a new profile. He kept compulsively scratching the area and 
it seemed to have set up some 
kind of local irritation. He had a 
plastiskin bandage over it now, 
which increased the hump and 
made the disguise better, though 
still more annoying, but at least 
it kept his fingernails away. After this weekend, when he'd meet 
the other three in Seville to compare notes, he'd have it attended 
to; meanwhile, there was nothing 
to do but bear it. There were 
doctors in Paris to whom it would 
be safe to go, but George didn't 
know them; that was Levinson's 
department. They had decided to 
work apart as much as possible,

IT 



so that the capture of one might 
hinder their activities, but 
wouldn't stop them altogether. 

At the moment, ironically 
enough, both the itches, as well 
as the skin dye and new hairline, were entirely unnecessary. 
George, mingling as usual with 
the largest crowd he could find 
anywhere, was attending the annual Beaux Arts Ball as one of 
approximately three .hundred 
robed, tinted and masked pseudoAfrican witch doctors — this costume being, for no discoverable 
reason, the season's favorite. 

Aside from the itches, he was 
enjoying himself thoroughly. He 
danced with all the prettiest 
women, who, according to immemorial custom, concealed about 
as much of themselves as the 
male guests left uncovered. He 
flirted with them, kissed them if 
they seemed amenable, and, 
whenever a fold of bustle or headdress gave him the opportunity, 
concealed leaflets on their persons. 

It was a safe method: most of 
the pamphlets probably would 
not be found until the costumes 
were removed. And although he 
observed that more of the ladies 
than he had counted on were dispensing with concealment at the 
ball itself, he was further protected by his costume and his 
excellent French. In case of extreme emergency, he had thought


fully provided himself with a 
skin-tight Lucifer suit under the 
witch-doctor's robes. 

Temporarily without a partner, George made his way 
through the press of bodies to a 
pillar, where he steadied himself 
long enough to look at his watch. 
It was getting on toward the unmasking hour. He looked around, 
over the heads of the crowd, to 
make sure he knew where the 
nearest side exit was. He was expecting something of a rumpus 
when it came time to unmask; 
there might be arrests. 

A masked man in S. P. uniform went by, closely clasped by 
a sumptuous dark girl at least a 
foot taller than himself. There 
were a good many S. P. costumes 
in the hall, and George suspected 
that the greater part of them were 
genuine. 

He turned, and his elbow sank 
into something soft and warm. 
He heard a stifled "AhF and saw 
that he had knocked the wind out 
of a young woman with astonishingly large eyes and an even 
more surprising bosom. He apologized, profusely. 

"Large pig," she shouted in his 
ear. "I forgive you. Embrace me." 

He did so, and felt her hands 
passing inquisitively over his 
flanks and chest, under the robe. 
She murmured, "Mmm," and 
kissed him a little harder. 

He broke away gently, feeling 



U 




 



that reconciliation had gone as 
far as it respectably could. She 
gave him an impish smile and 
disappeared into the crowd. 

George put two fingers cautiously under his robe and discovered a tiny oblong of folded 
paper. He opened it and saw the 
familiar headline: naissance OV 
mort! It was a copy of his own 
leaflet, printed on the same sort 
of home copier he used himself. 

He put it away with the rest 
of his supply. The movement he 
had started was growing wonderfully well. 

He went around the periphery 
of the crowd in the opposite direction to the one the girl had 
taken. Just ahead of him, near 
the bar, he saw a slender woman 
jostled by a passing man in a 
frog suit. Her glass slipped out 
of her fingers, and the liquor 
spread a dark stain over her flowing taffeta skirt. 

George whipped out his handkerchief and moved forward to 
help. Then he paused. The woman's hair was coppery and abundant, and the mouth below her 
half -mask was of a particular 
perfection he had seen only once 
in his life. Hilda. 

Caution told him to avoid her, 
but he had to be sure. He moved 
forward again, knelt beside her 
and dabbed at the stained skirt. 

"Thank you so much," she said 
In French, "but I'm afraid it's 



a hopeless mess now." 

It was her voice: George felt 
the customary tingling down his 
backbone. He had not seen Hilda 
since the night Art arrived in 
Venice, and had not hoped to see 
her for a long time to come. But 
it wasn't safe to let her recognize 
him. He stood up, bowed, and 
turned away without speaking. 

She caught suddenly at his 
arm, turned him around again. 
"George!" she said. "It is you. 
Where have you been hiding? 
I've looked everywhere. And 
Luther and Morey . . . What is 
all this nonsense?" 

George felt a little relieved, in 
spite of himself. Of course, she 
would know him from his youth 
alone, just as he knew her by 
her mouth. He said, "Hello, 
Hilda. I've missed you." 

"George." She put her lips close 
to his ear. "You won't hide from 
me any more, will you? We've got 
such a lot to tell each other — " 

A shattering blare of trumpets 
from the center of the room interrupted her. A much-amplified 
voice cried, "Mesdames et messieurs, the hour of unmasking is 
at hand. Choose your partners!" 

The babel of voices, which had 
subsided for a moment, rose, 
again. George glanced at his. 
watch, then, at the rafters high 
above. He could just make out a 
tiny gray^blue dot there, hang-, 
ing among the clustered lanterns., ,

It was time, this minute, this 
second — 

A new voice blared out, not as 
loud as the first, but clear and 
sharp. '^Citizens of the world!" it 
cried. "The future of mankind is 
in your hands! The government 
tells you that there is no danger 
— that the human race is not becoming sterile. The government 
lies! Find out the truth for yourself! Go to your doctor, have him 
examine you. Only one in ten is 
now capable of having children. 
If you are that lucky one, do not 
throw away your priceless heritage. Have children! Now, before 
it is too late!" 

Men were running toward the 





 



center of the room; George heard 
shouts and a few screams. The 
voice — George's own, recorded 
through a filter to make it unrecognizable — went on: "If the 
government is telling the truth, 
why is it afraid of open debate? 
Why are your newspapers censored? Why are you yourselves 
subject to illegal arrest and imprisonment without trial? Why — " 
A flat explosion drowned the 
voice, then another. There was a 
new outburst of feminine screams, 
and a sudden violent movement 
away from the center. The S. P.s, 
George guessed, were shooting at 
the playback mechanism he had 
bribed a workman to set up 



among the lanterns. It was tim« 
to get away. 

His recorded voice went on, but 
another drowned it out. "No one 
is to leave! Unmask, everyone, 
and stand where you are!" 

The movement away from the 
center continued. In the press, 
Hilda was clinging to his arm, 
shouting something at him. He 
broke away and dived into the 
crowd, heading for the side exit 
he had spotted before. 

He was a little too late. The 
crowd was in full motion now, as 
irresistible as a charging herd 
of cattle. Ahead of him, he saw 
an S. P. man vainly struggling 
to turn and halt those behind. He

■aw the flash of a revolver; then 
someone clubbed the man in the 
neck and he went down under the 
feet of the crowd. 

George had a sudden, terrified 
thought: What it that should 
happen to Hilda? But he was 
caught in the tide of bodies; it 
was useless even to think of turning back. 

The wide doors of the main entrance had been thrown open, but 
there was still a bottleneck. The 
pressure grew until George 
thought his ribs would crack; 
then he was out and running 
desperately to keep from being 
trampled. 

An S. P. car was pulled up at 
the opposite curb and, as he 
watched, another joined it. S. P.s 
tumbled out, tried to form a line. 
The crowd overwhelmed them. 
There were shouts of "A bas les 
flics!" and roars of laughter scattered among the screams. 

The crowd's temper was changing from fear to defiance. There 
would be broken windows and 
broken heads in Paris tonight. 

George's devil costume was 
now as dangerous as the witch 
doctor robes ; anybody in carnival 
dress who was unlucky enough 
to meet a policeman would be 
arrested. He stopped in an alley 
to strip them both off — he wore 
a singlet and shorts underneath 

and then put the noise of the 



rioting behind him before he 
crossed the Seine to his hotel. 

On the sidewalk in front of 
the hotel a huge N/M! was 
chalked — the symbol of the Committee Against Human Extinction, N/M in French and Spanish, G/T in German, B/D in English: Birth or Death.' They 
had begun it themselves, flying 
from city to city, one to a continent; the people had taken it 
up. 

He thought again of Hilda, and 
looked at his wrist phone. They 
no longer used the personal 
phones to communicate among 
themselves, since it was possible 
that the S. P. was monitoring all 
such calls; but it would do no 
harm to call Hilda, especially if 
he kept the contact short. He 
pressed the buttons that coded 
her number. 

"Yes?" said her warm voice. 
"This is Hilda Place." 

"It's George," he told her. "Are 
you all right?" 

"George, where are you? I must 
see you. Joe is here with me. Tell 
me where you are and we'll dash 
over." 

"It wouldn't do," said George 
regretfully. "I only wanted to 
know if you got out all right." 

"Yes, George, of course. But — " 

"Good night, Hilda," he said, and broke the connection. 

It was almost time for the 



42 




 



hourly newscast, but George sat 
for a few moments staring at the 
dead vision set, thinking about 
Hilda. Then he began thinking 
about himself and Hilda, which 
was more complicated. 

He hardly knew what it was 
he felt about Hilda, except that 
he wanted her. He knew that 
there was no basis for a settled 
relationship between them, but 
his mind rebelled at the knowledge. 

Well, if they succeeded in this, 
things would be different. Everybody would have to revise his 
view of life. The family would 
revive; religion with it, probably. 
The changes would go deep into 
the social structure, as Art and 
Luther said: affecting manners, 
morals, ultimately every department of human life. 

Not all at once, of course. For 
one thing, fewer than one person 
in ten would manage to become a 
parent before reaching the sterile 
age; and not all of those would 
be able, or want, to equate parenthood with marriage. 

George's own part in the new 
world was still hazy to him. He 
tried valiantly once more to see 
himself happily married to Hilda, 
and once more failed. The picture was simply wrong, in every 
way. He didn't have the conjugal 
temperament, and neither, he was 
sure, did Hilda. What was going 
to become of them, who had been 



born into this childless world of 
cautious carelessness and sage 
superficiality, and knew no other? 

That was rather good, George 
told himself. He was surprised 
and pleased; his wit was ordinarily of the evanescent variety, 
not worth using more than once. 
When he wrote his memoirs — 

There was a knock on the door. 

"Entrez," said George, and the 
door, keyed to his voice, swung 
open. Two S. P. men stood there. 
They did not hesitate, but strode 
rapidly toward him. 

With an effort, George relaxed 
his tensed muscles and looked 
at the advancing officers with 
what he hoped was the right mix* 
ture of alarm and indignation. 

"What is it? What's the matter?" he demanded. 

The taller officer had a sheaf 
of photographs in his hand. He 
riffled them rapidly, selected one, 
and looked keenly from it to 
George's face several times. He 
said something in an undertone 
to the other man. 

The short, stocky one drew his 
gu» and stepped aside. "I shall 
have to request you to come with 
us, monsieur. A formality only^ 
If you are innocent, you will be 
freed." 

"But what l» the charge?" 
esked George. 

"You are wanted for questioning L» connection with the riot at 
the Beaux Arts Ball, monsieur.** 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILD! IN 



49 



"I wasn't even there!" George 
protested. 

The officer shrugged. "That 
may be, monsieur. It is believed 
that the instigator of the riot is 
not a native of Paris. Therefore, 
we are investigating all guests of 
hotels. Those whose appearances 
are similar to those on these photographs are to be brought in for 
questioning. You are not under 
formal arrest, monsieur, unless 
you insist." 

George felt a hollowness at the 
pit of his stomach. Such an obvious move and they had not 
thought of it! He said, "Very 
well," and moved toward the 
door. The tall officer grasped his 
arm, the other fell in behind 
them. 

At the doorway, George lunged 
forward. As the tall officer instinctively pulled back, George 
followed his motion, turning at 
the same time and putting the 
heel of his hand under the other 
man's chin. He shoved, hard, and 
the officer went reeling back into 
the room. George slammed the 
door in their faces and ran. 

The elevator was not at this 
floor. He dived down the staircase, took the first flight four 
steps at a time, and doubled back 
on the floor below to the other 
staircase. He guessed that the 
S. P.s had come by car; for a 
house-to-house search, it would 
be more efficient than 'copters. 



If he was right, he had a fair 
chance of hailing a cab and getting away before they found him. 

Back on his own floor, he 
peered cautiously around the corner before emerging from the 
stairway. His room door was 
open, but there was no one in the 
corridor. He heard nothing. He 
darted out and up the ascending 
staircase. 

The roof was silent and deserted under the stars, glowing 
at his feet in a wash of light from 
the tubes that outlined the roof. 
Traffic went by inaudibly, high 
overhead in the dark sky. 

He saw the yellow riding lights 
of an unoccupied cab, not directly above, but bearing a little 
to one side. He took out his flashlight and blinked at it, trying 
hard to get the aim right; it was 
a long distance and a difficult 
angle. 

The 'copter did not turn. It 
kept its course and disappeared 
finally down toward the Eiffel 
Tower. 

He heard a sound down the 
stairwell. It was an ambiguous, 
uncomfortable sort of sound. He 
listened, but it was not repeated. 

He walked quietly behind the 
stair entrance and tried again. 
Another empty cab was approaching, no nearer than the 
first. He aimed the flashlight tube 
at it, blinked it rapidly on and 
off. 




 



After a heart-stopping moment, the cab turned toward him. 
And then he heard stealthy 
sounds in the stairwell. He 
listened. Footsteps, coming up. 

He glanced at the oncoming 
cab. Too late; too far away. He 
went quickly to the nearest parapet, and holding the tiny flashlight like a dagger, stabbed it at 
the glow tube. Glass tinkled and 
fell, and the light died along that 
edge of the roof. The corner was 
only a few steps away; he broke 
the next tube as well. Now the 
roof was lighted only on the two 
sides farthest from him, and the, 
stair entrance cast a long, deep 
shadow. 

He heard them step out onto 
the roof. They must have had a 
third man waiting in the car 
downstairs, George thought; 
when they learned that he had 
not appeared down there, they 
had turned back to search upstairs. 

The cab had turned away, now 
that the signal had stopped and 
the edge-lights gone out. George 
watched its tiny lights dwindle. 

The footsteps came toward 
him, slowly, one pair on either 
side of the entrance. Two beams 
of light shot out, illuminating all 
the roof except the rear wall of 
the entranceway where he stood. 

"You had better surrender, 
monsieur," said a voice. "Otherwise we are obliged to shoot." 



George pressed himself thi« 
against the wall and tried to 
breathe quietly. The voice had 
come from the right; that was 
the spokesman, the stocky man 
with the gun. Therefore, he 
guessed, the other would step out 
first. He moved silently to the 
left, raised his arm and waited. 

The tall man stepped suddenly 
into view, swinging his flash 
around. George brought the edge 
of his palm down with all his 
strength, aiming for the man's 
wrist, but hitting the flashlight 
instead. Pain rolled up his arm 
as the metal tube fell; then, 
blinded by the light that had 
shone in his eyes, he was struggling with the tall S. P. man. He 
struck out furiously, feeling a 
blow in return that numbed his 
side, and then the two of thera 
toppled to the roof. 

George struck the other man 
once more, felt the grip loosen, 
and scrambled desperately to his 
feet. As he started to turn, a 
crushing pain struck him at the 
base of his skull. He saw the 
roof's surface rising toward him, 
but felt nothing when it hit him. 

VI 

TIE was in a 'copter with a 
rope ladder dangling from it, 
hovering just over the bedroom 
window of Luther's apartment. 
Art was inside, but he wouldn't 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN 



45 



climb out onto the ladder. George 
was about to pull the ladder up 
and tie a wrench to it when Art's 
red, wild-eyed face appeared. 

Hurry, hurry! Art was climbing up the ladder, and now the 
window next door opened and a 
man was leaning out, with a gun 
in his hand. 

George was paralyzed with 
fear. He saw the man fire, and 
when he looked down, Art's face 
was white and a thin spray of 
blood was whipping away from 
his body in the wind of the rotors. 

He's hit, George thought. He'll 
tall. 

George tilted the 'copter downward, toward the canal, but he 
was too late. Art fell, and the 
blue water of the canal turned 
red . . . 

No, that was silly. All that was 
over and done with; they had 
come out of that all right. It was 
the Beaux Arts Ball that he had 
to worry about. His voice was 
bellowing out of the concealed 
playback machine, and everyone 
was turning to stare at him. He 
looked down, and saw that his 
witch-doctor's robe was gone. He 
was standing there in the devil 
suit. 

All the others were shouting, 
"There he is! He's the one!** 

He ran, but the crowd got in 
his way; he couldrt't move fast 
enough. And just behind him was 
the stocky man with the gun. He 



couldn't get away, death was behind him, the gun-barrel rising, 
the finger tightening on the trigger — 
Ugh.' 

He sat up, looking uncomprehendingly at the strange patterns 
of light and shadow around him. 
His head hurt, and he couldn't 
raise his hands. Someone flashed 
a light in his eyes. Dazzled, he 
said, "What — who are you? What 
are you doing?" 

A voice said, "Bien." Someone 
got up from beside his cot, and 
two men, one in a white jacket, 
left the room. He could see them 
briefly in the light of the corridor 
outside. Another man, in a 
guard's uniform, shut the barred 
door with a clang, and went 
away. 

There was an interval long 
enough for him to come fully 
awake, and discover that his 
wrists were manacled to the sides 
of the cot. Then two guards appeared at the door, unlocked it 
and entered. One of them removed the manacles and helped 
him to his feet. He tried to throw 
off the man's arm, but found that 
he was too weak; too weak, in 
fact, to stand by himself. 

They led him along the corridor and into a small, brightly lit 
room where there was a heavy 
chair, bolted to the floor. They 
sat him in it and strapped his 
wrists down. 




 



A white-jacketed man at the 
side of the room was removing a 
hypodermic from a sterilizer. He 
turned, fitted the needle to the 
transparent shaft, depressed the 
plunger and thrust the needle 
through the covering membrane 
©f a bottle. He stepped toward 
George. 

George gripped the arms of the 
chair, remembering what Art had 
told him about truth serums. 
"They're not infallible. If you 
have a strong, balanced personality, and if you think up a good 
cover story and stick to it, truth 
serums won't make you tell the 
truth. 

I was at the ball, he thought 
rapidly, but I had nothing to do 
with the plot. I haven't seen Luther, Art or Morey since that 
party at Luther's. I don't know 
where they are. I don't know 
where they are. I ran trom the 
police because I seduced a 
woman at the ball, and her boyfriend was angry with me. I was 
afraid he had made trouble for 
me with the police. That's not 
good, but it will have to do. 

He felt the coolness of evaporating alcohol on his arm, then 
the cold stab of the needle. / was 
at the ball, he told himself, but 
J had nothing to do with the plot. 
1 haven't seen Luther, Art, or 
Morey ... or Luther, or Morey . . . 

He was beginning to feel 
drowsy. The words tripped over 



each other in his head, became 
hopelessly jumbled. 

There was a timeless, drowsy 
interval; then he became aware 
that a hot rubber sheath was 
being removed from his arm. His 
body was stiff, and his hands and 
feet were numb. \ 

He opened his eyes. The whitejacketed man was stuffing something that clicked into an oblong 
box. He stowed the box away in 
a clip at the side of a massive instrument board on wheels, and 
an attendant pushed it out of 
the room. 

The man looked at George, 
flexing the fingers of one hand in 
the palm of the other. "You gave 
us a hard time," he said. "But 
you talked." 

George kept his mouth shut, 
even when the guards came back, 
unstrapped him and returned him 
to his cell. 

Probably the man had been 
blurring; they were hoping that 
he could be tricked into talking 
by making him believe that he 
already had. 

But early the next morning, he 
was transferred to another, a 
larger cell. In it were Luther, Art 
and Morey. 

Art said, "You knew where we 
were all going to be yesterday. 
If the truth drug didn't get it out 
of you, all they had to do was 
put a lie detector on you and 
show you a map — point out one

headquarters on the

Place de Concorde. They'll move 
us to Berne for the trials, I suppose." Art shrugged. "// they decide to have any trials." 

The day dragged by, then another and another. On the fourth 
day, they were told they were 
going to be moved in the afternoon, but nothing happened. 
They had no news of the outside 
world; they could only speculate 
how the movement was going 
without them. All four of them 
had been up for interrogation 
several times, and they were 
afraid that at least one of them 
had given up names and addresses under the truth serum. 
There was no way of knowing. 
If the network they had care-, 
fully built up had been uncovered, there was no hope left. The 
conspiracy was too young to recover from such a blow. 

By tacit consent, they did not 
talk about anything they had 
done before their arrest. But Art, 
one afternoon, began speculating 
about the future. He spoke of it 
as if it were a foregone conclusion, as if they were as good as 
dead. 

He said, "It would be interesting to see it. After a few more 
centuries, I expect things will 
begin to go to pot in a small way. 
Things like new construction. 
The population's steadily declining, and you know there won't 
be any new generations, so why 



build? And after that, why repair? A little later on, I'd guess 
that suicide would begin to be 
a factor again. When they begin 
to realize that if there is any 
point to the whole bloody business, the human race will never 
have a chance to find it out . . . 
Not much room for altruism any 
more. 

"We're here, and we're the last, 
and that's all. After that, nothing 
but the big dark and the big cold. 
Besides, it isn't going to be very 
pleasant later on, and people will 
begin to see that, too. There's 
a bottom limit to the size of population that can support an industrial economy. They'll pass it, 
going down. Then what? Back to 
the land? A mocked-up feudal 
system? * 

"But then the process will start 
to accelerate, I should think. 
Wars. Plagues. Natural catastrophes. Crop failures. Looters and 
bandits. Every man for himself. 
And at the end—" 

He smiled bitterly. "None 'of 
us would be alive to see that, 
anyhow. Women's life-span is 
still longer than ours. It'll end up 
as a world of women — women 
without men. Lord!" He shook 
his head. "That goes beyond my 
imagination. I can't visualize it, 
and I don't want to. The little 
that I can see scares me silly." 

He looked at them as if he had 
forgotten they were there. 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN 



49 



"Sorry," he said. "I didn't mean 
to turn this into a wake." 

George thought a good deal 
about Golightly, and the rest of 
that stubborn, irrational, powerhungry crew. He found that he 
didn't hate them, but it made him 
feel somehow betrayed to realize 
that these were the best rulers 
Earth had been able to produce. 
Good administrators, good practical politicians, as Art had said 
— but little men, jealous of their 
position, fearful of new ideas. If 
that was the best the human race 
could do, perhaps it deserved 
what it was getting. 

He voiced something of this, 
and got the disagreement from 
Luther that he had hoped for. 

"We can do better, George. We 
have done better. In a normal 
world, no matter how bad things 
get, at least they change. If we 
were bringing up a. flock of children now, one of them would Jbe 
a better candidate for World 
President than Golightly. But as 
it is, we're stuck with just about 
three generations all told, and 
we have to make the best of 
it . . His voice trailed off ; none 
of them wanted to pursue that 
thought. 

N« the morning of the eighth 
day, guards came to take 
them away. 

George turned to Luther. "In 
case they separate us, and we 



don't see each other again — " 

Luther took his hand warmly. 
They gripped hands all around. 
There were tears in Art's owlish 
eyes, and in Luther's, and even a 
suspicious brightness in Morey's. 
George found that his own vision 
was blurring a trifle. 

The guards led them down the 
corridor to an outer office with a 
long desk and a bench. They were 
told to sit down, and then a 
printed document and a pen was 
placed in front of each of them. 

George stared bewilderedly at 
his. It seemed to say: 

In return for due consideration, I 
hereby waive all claim for damages 
resulting from my mistaken arrest and 
detention by the Security Police, and 
further agree to waive my right of 
suit for false arrest against the Security 
Police and the United Nations of the 
World. In witness whereof I set my 
teal. 

He looked at the others, then 
at the guard who was standing on 
the other side of the table. 

"Sign," said the guard, "and 
you'll be released." 

Art bent suddenly and began 
to scribble on his sheet. The 
others followed suit. Not daring 
to speak, they looked at each 
other as the signed papers were 
taken away. Then a guard led 
them off, each to a separate cubicle. In his, George found the 
clothes he had been wearing 
when he was arrested, and all the 
contents of his pockets neatly 



50 




 



stacked. He put on the clothing, 
still dazed. The guard, not touching him now, led him out through 
another outer office, through a 
lobby, where the other three 
joined him, and then to the sunlight of the portico. 

The sounds of traffic came up 
to them; 'copters droned past in 
the sky over their heads; they 
heard a strain of music from 
somewhere down the great avenue. 

The guard reappeared and 
touched George's elbow. "I was 
asked to give you this, monsieur," 
he said, and put a slip of paper 
into George's hand. Then he 
bowed and went back inside. 

George unfolded it slowly, read 
it twice. 

It said: 

Come and sec me as soon as you can. 

Hilda 

There was an address below 
the signature. 

George passed the note to 
Morey, and the other two looked 
ever his shoulders. 

"I don't get it," said George inadequately. 

"No more do I," said Luther. 
»fBut— let's go!" 

They found her on a terrace 
(Overlooking the Champs Elysees. 
Joe Krueger, grinning like a 
youngster, got up from the table 
and stood aside as they converged on Hilda. 



She smiled up at them. "I'm so 
glad," she said. "Now kiss me 
nicely, each of you, and then sit 
down . . . You there, Luther, in 
the easy chair, then Morey, Art 
and George." 

They said hello to Joe. They 
took the coffee cups Hilda passed 
around. And they stared at her. 

"Hilda," said Luther finally, 
"you consummate witch, what in 
the world did you do?" 

She smiled at them happily. 
"Well," she said, "I managed to 
get to see Golightly. It wasn't 
easy to do, even though I know 
his granddaughter quite well. I 
had to convince her*nrst, you see 
. . . No, you don't see. You will, 
in a minute, though. I told him 
that he couldn't stop people from 
having children by throwing you 
in jail. 1 told him that women 
had been breaking the birth prohibition for the last seventy years, 
to my own knowledge, and probably longer. And I proved it to 
him — I showed him a doctor's 
report that stated I had been a 
mother myself." 

They stared at her. George felt 
as if the last prop of his own personal universe had been knocked 
out from under him. 

"You, Hilda?" said Luther incredulously. 

"Oh, yes." She looked back at 
them, not smiling now, and laid 
her hand on Joe Krueger's sleeve. 
"This is my son, gentlemen — my 



WORLD WITHOUT CHILDREN 



51 



youngest son. I have three." 
There was a shocked silence. 
Joe said, "She brought me up 
in a private estate in the Berkshires, with some help from my 
brothers, but alone most of the 
time. She nursed me, took care 
of me when I was sick, and taught 
Tie everything she could. For 

wenty years . . . My twentieth 

irthday was two months ago." 
Luther said, "Hilda, do I un
lerstand that you began this absolutely alone?" 

She smiled, but it was a different smile from the one they 
knew. Her face had changed 
subtly, Geprge thought; there was 
a calm patience and wisdom in it 
that had never been there before 
— or that she had never allowed 
them to see. 

Her eyes softened, and she said, 
"I don't blame you, darlings, because you don't know — you can't 
know. Poor things, you run the 
world, but you don't understand 

vhat keeps it going. 
"Anyhow, I told Golightly all 

hat, and I presented a chemical 
analysis of Joe's blood. He hasn't 
had the longevity treatment yet, 
you know; that showed in the 
test. And then I gave him some 
statistics Joe had dug up. You'd 
better tell that part, Joe." 

"I was curious to know whether 
the incidence of amnesia had 
gone up since the Last War," 
said Joe. "I had an idea that 



other people besides Hilda had 
thought of that dodge. So I 
checked. It was up, way up. 
There was even an article about 
it in the North American Journal 
of Psychology, not so many yearg 
ago. 

Art muttered something in an 
irritated voice. 

"Art?" said Hilda. 

"Nothing. I saw that article; 
I remember it now. It didn't 
make any impression on me." 

"Or on anybody, apparently," 
said Joe " — luckily for us members of the younger generation." 
He grinned. "Then I looked up 
some population figures and drew 
curves. You couldn't prove anything that way, but it was significant if you knew the answer 
to begin with. After the War, the 
line went downward fairly sharply for about the first century, and 
then it began to level off just a 
little more than anyone had expected. At a rough guess, there 
are several hundred million people alive today who were born 
after the birth prohibition!" 

Inside the apartment, a fax 
machine chuckled to itself and 
then sounded a clear note. Luther jumped, and George started 
to rise. 

Hilda said, "You get it, will 
you, Joe?" The young man — it 
was astonishing how young he 
seemed, now — smiled and went 
inside. He came out a moment

later and handed the fax sheet to 
George. 

George read, " 'The birth prohibition has been rescinded, it 
was revealed at 10 A. M. Greenwich time today, by an extraordinary session of the Executive 
Council meeting in Berne, president Golightly released the following statement: 

" ' "It has been proved to my 
satisfaction, and to the satisfaction of the highest medical 
authorities, that a clear danger of 
total sterility of the human race 
exists. Under these circumstances, 
grave though the decision is, I 
have no possible alternative but 
to revoke all penalties against 
giving birth. . * 

"'"We stand today at the 
crossroads of human destiny. On 
one hand we see the total extinction of our kind; on the other, a 
new and more glorious fulfilment. 
The centuries to come will be 
hard ones for some of us; 
they will bring many profound 
changes in our society, and many 
grave problems. But given the 
boundless courage of our people, 
and their unflinching determination to succeed — " ' " 

"Does he say anything else?" 
asked Art. 

"No. But here's something 
about us. 'Arthur Levins'on, 
M. D., George Miller, Morey 
Stiles and Luther Wheatley, ringleaders of the so-called Commit
WORLD WITHOUT CHIIDRI 



tee Against Human Extinction, 
were released early this morning 
by the Paris division of the Security Police. In a special statement, S. P. chief Paul Krzewski 
characterized their activities as 
"sincere but premature," and indicated that no charges would 
be pressed against any member 
of their organization.' " 

Morey lit a cigar. "That's 
about as much thanks as we'll 
ever get," he said. 

"You weren't finished, were 
you, Hilda?" Art asked. "I don't 
quite see Golightly listening to 
reason, even with all that evidence." 

"No," she said. "AH that first 
part was just the preliminary. 
Then I called in his granddaughter — she was waiting outside. 
That was why I had to persuade 
her before I could do anything." 

"I begin to see the light," said 
Art softly. "She's a mother, too." 

"Of course. I've known it for 
years. As a matter of fact — this 
is rather funny, and something I 
didn't know before — she told Golightly that his private secretary 
is her daughter." 

Her face grew pinker. She 
leaned her forehead on her hand 
for a moment. Her shoulders were 
shaking. "You should have seen 
his face!" she said. 

They were all roaring with 
laughter, the tension in them dissolving to leave them weak and

wonderfully relieved. It was several moments before George 
glanced at Hilda and saw that 
Joe was standing over her in an 
attitude of concern, his hand on 
her shoulder. Her head was still 
bent into her palm. George 
realized abruptly that she was 
no longer laughing, but crying. 

He stood up and went around 
to her, feeling awkward. "Anything I can do?" he asked. 

Hilda dabbed at her eyes with 
a handkerchief and then looked 
up at them. "Just a touch of 
hysterics, I guess. I do feel like 
a fool. Only — I didn't realize how 
scared I'd been." 

George squeezed her shoulder 
and went back to his place. Joe 
left the table again to bring in a 
bottle of Chablis and glasses; 
there was a pleasant interval of 
tinkling and gurgling, and when 
it was over, Hilda was her usual 
self again. 

Luther raised his glass. "To 
Hilda." 

"Hilda, my dear," said Art 
slowly, "would you mind telling 
me why you did it? I hope I 
don't sound ungrateful, but — it 
wasn't just to save our lives?" 

Hilda hesitated a moment. 
"No, Art." 

"I didn't think so," he said. 
"I've just now managed to picture you as a mother, and in that 
light I can see you doing almost 
anything else for us four, obtuse 



as you must have thought us — 
but not risking a hair of young 
Joe's head." 

She smiled fondly at him. "I 
don't really think you're obtuse, 
Art. If I sounded that way, it was 
just feminist exaggeration. I suppose you're thinking now that all 
your trouble and danger were 
for nothing, because we women 
have been breeding right along 
. . . but I don't think that's true. 

"I think that's the difference, 
the really fundamental difference, 
between men and women. We 
women endure — we plug along, 
doing the obvious things, keeping 
house and worrying about our 
men and bearing children and so 
on. And if we didn't, Lord knows 
what would become of us all. But 
left to ourselves, we're too conservative. Women felt this problem of children from the beginning, and solved it on their own 
level. But not completely, not 
satisfactorily. You four discovered the same problem intellectually only a few months ago, 
and look what you've done!" 

She made little fists on the 
table for a moment. "I'll confess 
that it was very hard for me to 
risk Joe. And I didn't do it, finally, because of my fondness for 
you four. If it had been only 
that, I honestly don't know what 
I should have done. 

"But — well, perhaps an example will shojv you best. My oldest

son, Edwin, wants to be a doctor, 
wants it more than anything. 
He's fifty years old now — that's 
a long time to wait for the one 
thing you want most in the world. 
But there are no medical schools, 
only research seminars and a few 
brush-up courses. There's no 
place in the world now like the 
one where Art got his earliest 
training." 

"There will be," promised Art. 

"Of course. And a million other 
things ... It isn't particularly 
good for a child to be brought up 
in hiding, as Joe was." 

"No one could have done it any 
better than you, Hilda," said Joe. 

"Sweet," she said; "but you 
all know I'm right." 

"Of course you are," agreed 
Luther. "In fact, you're so right 
that I'm a little afraid of you. It 
was much nicer when I thought 
you were pretty much a featherbrain." 

George said suddenly, "Joe, I 
never wangled you that introduction I promised you, did I?" 

Joe's eyes brightened. "To 
Clarke, the rocket man?" 

"That's the one. Luther, can 
you arrange it?" 

"A pleasure. I didn't know you 
were interested, Joe." 

"Yes," said Hilda, a little regretfully, "I wish he weren't." 

Joe looked uncomfortable. 
Morey spoke up unexpectedly: 
"You'll have to face it, though. 



Hilda. This is one of the spheres 
where men take over." 

"That's right," said Morey, 
"that's where they'll have to go, 
the overflow, the extra population that's had us all trembling 
in our socks the last three centuries. To the stars." He pushed 
his chair back and sat looking 
out over the sunlit street, and the 
'copters flashing in the sky. "That 
will make Golightly and me 
happy, at least, for the next few 
hundred years." He smiled his 
unexpected, small-boy smile. 
"We can sit here and be as contrary and stubborn as we want. 
But we'll be just a backwater, 
Hilda. It's your Joe that's going 
to be the human race." 

They drank to that, and afterward George found himself alone 
with Hilda for a moment before 
they left. She kissed him gently: 
there were no tingles up his spine. 
He felt warmly fond of her, and 
somehow at peace with himself. 

The world was going to grow 
down to his size, he realized. He 
wouldn't be The Child any more, 
not to everybody. In fact, the first 
colony on that far-off planet of 
Alpha Centauri might need a few 
older men around — men with a * 
few centuries of solid experience 
under their belts. Now there was 
an idea! 

Happily, he went down into the 
long afternoon.
