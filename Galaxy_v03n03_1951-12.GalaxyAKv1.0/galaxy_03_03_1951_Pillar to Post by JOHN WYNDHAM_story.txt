18th Feb. 
Messrs. Thompson & Handett 
Attorneys-at-Law 
512 Gable Street 
Philadelphia, Pa. 
Gentlemen: 

In response to your request, we 
have conducted a thorough examination of our patient, Stephen 
Dallboy, and have established his 
identity beyond legal question. 



Attested documents in support 
of this are enclosed, and dispose 
entirely of his claim to the Terence Molton property. 

At the same time k we admit 
we are bewildered. The condition 
of the patient has altered quite 
radically since our last examination, when he was indubitably 
feebleminded. Indeed, but for this 
obsession that he is Terence Molton, which he maintains with 
complete consistency, we should

now classify him as normal. In 
view of the obsession and the remarkable assertions with which 
he supports it,' we feel that he 
should remain here under observation, which may give us the 
opportunity of dispelling the 
whole fantasy system — and at the 
same time of clearing up several 
points we find puzzling. 

In order that you may more 
clearly understand the situation, 
we are enclosing a copy of a 
statement written by the patient, 
which we suggest you study before reading our concluding remarks. 

STATEMENT BY TERENCE MOLTON 

I KNOW this is difficult to 
believe. In fact, when the 
thing first happened, I didn't 
believe it myself. I figured it was 
just a stage, maybe, in the deteriorating process. I've had 
enough dope long enough to play 
hell with my nervous system — 
yet the funny thing was how real 
it seemed right away. Still, I 
thought, everything would seem 
real to De Quincey when he was 
coked up, 'and to Coleridge, too. 

A damsel with a dulcimer 
In a vision once I saw ... 

Vision is a poor word — all 
quality and no quantity. How 
strong was that vision? Could he 



put out his hand and touch the 
babe? He heard her sing, but did 
she speak to him? And did he 
find himself a new man, free from 
pain? I guess even the milk and 
honey of Paradise are relative. 
Some would yearn for a kind of 
celestial Hollywood, but just having no pain and being complete 
would have been Paradise enow 
for me. 

It had been just over four years 
since that mine had got me — four 
years, nine operations and more 
to come. Interesting for the doctors, no doubt, but it had turned 
me into just a hulk in a wheelchair, with only half of one leg 
and no feet at all under the 
blanket. 

"Go easy on the dope," the 
surgeon had warned me. 

"What'll happen if I don't?" I 
asked. 

"You don't want to become an 
addict, do you?" 

.That was funny. If they'd given 
me anything else to stop the pain, 
I wouldn't have wanted to risk 
addiction. But they didn't have 
anything else. And if they had 
refused me dope, I'd have killed 
myself. They knew that. So the 
nurses gave it to me, though always trying to talk me into cutting down. 

And there was Sally. She used 
to come to the hospital every 
visiting day, bringing me candy 
or books and cigarettes, and lean


132 




 



ing over the bed to kiss me, with 
that gentle little smile that needs 
only a word to turn it into hopeless weeping. 

I finally said, "Look, Sally, this 
isn't doing you or me any good. 
The sample I showed you was a 
healthy young guy. What you'd 
■ get now isn't anything like the 
sample. Why don't you go find 
somebody who is?" 

Poor kid, it nearly broke her 
up. She argued out of mistaken 
loyalty, but I didn't want her on 
my conscience. They tell me her 
husband's a good joe and the 
baby is cute. Some of the nurses 
and Gray Ladies thought: I was 
brooding about it. The fact is this 
is how I figure it should be. 

All the same, when every 
woman you see is kind to you — 
in about the same way she would 
be to a sick dog — 

Oh, well, there was always the 
dope. 

And then, when I wasn't expecting anything at all except 
more pain and misery, there was 
this . . . this vision. 

npHE day had been a rotten one 
•■■ for me. My right leg and my 
left foot were hurting a lot. But 
most of the right leg had been 
taken off and the left foot had 
had to go, too, a little later, so 
nothing could be done about it 
except to reach for the bottle. 
Maybe I took a little more than 



usual, but for all the difference it 
made to anyone else, I might as 
well be doped to the' eyes all the 
time. 

I lay back, feeling the pain 
fade out. I seemed to float 
smoothly and 'gently up and 
away, disembodied, filled with a 
surging lightness. The pain must 
have made me pretty tired, I 
guess, because I could feel myself falling asleep before I'd even 
begun to enjoy the lack of it ... . 

When I opened my eyes, there, 
in front of me, was the vision of 
the damsel. She didn't have a 
dulcimer, and she certainly did 
not look Abyssinian, but she was 
singing, very quietly. It was an 
odd" song, and for all I knew it 
might have been about Mount 
Abora, because I couldn't understand a word of it. 

We were in a room — well, yes, 
it was a room, though it was more 
like being inside a bubble. It was 
all cool green, with a soft opalescence, and the walls curving up 
so you couldn't tell where they 
became ceiling. There were two 
arched openings in the sides. 
Through them were tree tops and 
a patch of blue sky. Close to one 
of them, the girl was fiddling 
with something I couldn't see. 

She glanced toward me, and 
saw that my eyes were open. She 
turned and said something that 
sounded like a question, but it 
meant absolutely nothing to me.

I just looked back at her. 

She was worth looking at. A 
tall, beautifully proportioned figure, with brown hair caught back 
by a ribbon. The material of her 
dress was diaphanous, yet there 
was a vast amount of it, arranged 
in multitudes of cunning folds. It 
made me think of the pre-Raphaelites' versions of the classical. 
It must have been cobweb-light, 
for as she moved it swirled and 
hesitated in mid-air. The result 
was like that frozen high-wind 
effect so popular in late Greek 
sculpture. 

When I did not reply, she 
frowned a little and repeated her 
question. I did not pay a lot of 
attention to the words. As a matter of fact, I was thinking: "Well, 
that's that; I've had it," and deciding that I was now in some 
kind of anteroom to Heaven, or — i 
well, anyway, an anteroom. I 
wasn't scared, not even greatly 
surprised. I remember feeling, 
"That's a nasty experience finished with," and wondering a 
little that the prelude to eternity 
should resemble certain Victorian 
schools of painting. 

When I still did not answer, 
her dark eyes widened a little. 
There was a look of wonder in 
them, perhaps a slight tinge of 
alarm, as she came toward me. 
Slowly she said: 

, "You— are — not— Hymorell?" 
j Her English had a strange ac


cent, and anyway I did not know 
what hymorell meant. I might be, 
or I might not. She went on: 

"Not— Hymorell? Some— other 
— person?" 

It sounded as if Hymorell was 
a name. 

"I'm Terry," I told her. "Terry 
Molton." 

There was a block of the green 
stuff near me. It looked hard and 
cold, but she sat down on it and 
stared at me, her expression halfdisbelief mixed with surprise. 

By this time I was beginning 
to discover myself. I was lying 
on a remarkably soft couch with 
some kind of blanket over me 
that smoothed itself out when I 
turned, instead of getting bunched 
under me. I don't know how they 
got it to do that. It moved all the 
way down what should have been 
my right leg — including what 
would have been my right foot, if 
I'd had one. 

I sat up suddenly, feeling my 
legs, both of them. There wasn't 
any pain. But there were two legs 
and two feet! 

Then I did something I hadn't 
let myself do in years — I burst 
into teajrs. 

SHE began speaking to me in 
uncertain, foreign English, and 
I remember wondering how there 
could be a language problem at 
the gates of Paradise. But I was 
more concerned with myself. I 



134 




 



threw back the blanket and sat 
staring at the legs. 

"They're not mine," I said 
dazedly, and then looked at the 
hand with which I felt them. 
"That's not mine, either." 

"Of — course," she said hesitantly. "How could — they be?" 

"I can wriggle the toes and 
bend the fingers, so what's the 
difference? You can't expect any 
sense in a dream." 

I don't recall what we talked 
about then. I suppose I was too 
excited and bewildered to take it 
all in. I do know she told me her 
name — Clytassamine-crand I remember thinking it was a real 
mouthful. But what seemed more 
important was to swing the legs 
over the side and stand on them. 

For the first time since that 
mine got me, I stood! 

There's no sense going into a 
lot of detail. What I might say 
would be about as informative as 
a Trobrian Islander's first impression of New York. I just had 
to take most things on trust, the 
way he would. 

"You need — the word is — garments, is it not?" she asked. 

I certainly did. Staying in a 
hospital for four years, you get 
to think of women as nurses, so 
I hadn't been aware of it. She 
didn't seem concerned and that 
helped me not to be. She stood 
me in a little cubicle that must 
have taken my measurements

somehow, because clothes came 
out of a slot in the wall. There 
was a whale of a lot of it, and 
not a seam to be seen. Pretty 
filmy and ridiculous, it seemed to 
me, but it satisfied her, so I let 
her help me put it on. When I 
was dressed, she opened the door. 

"You mean I have to go out in 
this damned nightgown?" I demanded. 

"We all — dress — this way," she 
said. "In other garments — people 
—notify." 

It stopped me for a moment. 
"Notice?" I asked. 

"Notice," she corrected herself without self-consciousness. 
"Come." 

We emerged into a great hall 
built of the same green composition. I figured that if Manhattan were to sink into the Hudson 
River, Grand Central Station 
under water would look about the 
way this place did. 

A number of people were 
around, none of them hurrying. 
All their clothes were of the filmy 
stuff, but as far as color and design went, it was apparently each 
to his own taste. There was a 
deadening of sound that I found 
oppressive, perhaps because you'd 
normally expect an echo in a huge 
place like this, whereas our slippers were silent on the floor and 
the quiet voices made only a soft 
hum. 

Clytassamine led the way to a 

ISS 



row of double seats set against the 
wall and pointed to an end seat. 
I sat down experimentally in it, 
and she sat confidently beside me. 

The seat rose about four inches 
from the floor and began to drift 
across the room. 

"Are you sure this is all right?" 
I asked, worried. 

"This is — conveyance. You — 
traveled? — went? — only by foot 
and by — animal?" 

I looked at her in astonishment. "Are you kidding? I've 
been in cars, planes, tanks, ships, 
trains." 

Did she think I came from a 
farm? 

IN the middle of the great room, 
we turned and slid silently toward an arch at the far end, and 
out into the open air. We rose 
until we had an elevation of a 
yard or so above the ground, 
while, from the shallow platform 
to which the seat was attached, 
a curved windshield came up to 
cover us. 

We accelerated to twenty -five 
miles an hour, I'd say, and swept 
smoothly across parklike country, traveling a course between 
occasional trees and clumps of 
bushes. I suppose she was navigating the contraption in some 
way, but I couldn't see how. In 
every way except speed, it was a 
better way to travel than anything else I've known — more in 



the magic carpet class. 

It was a strange journey ; something over an hour, I imagine, 
and in all that time we never 
crossed nor even saw a road, 
though twice I noticed paths that 
didn't seem to be used much. 

"No cultivated fields or gardens?" I asked. 

She looked blank. I tried to explain in terms of food, but that 
didn't clear anything up. She 
seemed completely unfamiliar 
with the idea of vegetables or 
grains, which increased my feeling that I was in a spirit world 
where we were supposed to live 
on ambrosia. There were deerlike 
creatures that paid us no attention. I was afraid to ask if they 
were raised as meat animals. 

The only signs of humanity 
were occasional large buildings to 
be seen above the trees, but they 
weren't on our course. The trees 
were, though. Every time we came 
to a section of woods, I tried to 
pull back on a nonexistent stick 
and hop over it, but apparently 
the contraption didn't work that 
way, for we always went around 
and not over obstacles. 

"Are you just showing me the 
sights, or are we heading anywhere in particular?" I wanted 
to know. 

Both concepts gave her trouble. 
"All — things are sights," she said, 
after I'd done my best to explain. "If nowhere to go, stay—

home. With you it is — otherwise?" 

She should have seen weekend 
traffic. I didn't describe it because 
by that time I began to catch 
glimpses of a building on a hill 
ahead of us. 

I'm no architect and I can't 
say this part showed this kind of 
influence and that part something 
else. It wouldn't have made much 
difference if I could have, though, 
because every building I had ever 
seen had been based on some 
geometrical pattern. This looked 
more as if it had grown. Bushes 
came close up against it, and a 
lot were even sprouting on top. 
The only reason I was sure it was 
a building was that it couldn't be 
anything natural. 

As we got nearer, I became 
still more bewildered. I could see 
now that what I had thought to 
be small bushes were full-grown 
trees— even those on top of it. 
The place was unbelievably immense. Then, in the midst of my 
amazement, I remembered myself, and smiled. The dope dream 
was running true to form: 

It was a miracle of rare device, 
A sunny pleasure dome with 
caves of ice. 

But when we arrived, it wasn't 
at all like that. It rose before us 
like a cleverly designed artificial 
mountain. We swept into it 
through an entrance sixty yards 



wide and several hundred feet 
high, to emerge into a central hall 
of staggering size. 

There was no suggestion whatever of "pleasure dome," though 
something of the "caves of ice" 
feeling came from the translucency of the pearly walls. 

"jl/TORE slowly, and seeming to 
drift like a feather in an air 
current, we floated across the 
place. There were a few men and 
women walking in a leisurely 
fashion, and a few chairs gliding 
as our own did. 

"A kind of railroad terminal?" 
I asked. 

She didn't get it, nor did airfield, bus station or waiting room 
mean anything to her. I gave up 
and watched us go through the 
enormous hall and through a 
dozen or more passages and lesser 
halls, wondering how she could 
find her way. But I wasn't too 
surprised — it always puzzles me 
how people can get around in 
cities I don't know, especially 
where the streets have names instead of numbers. 

We came to a relatively small 
hall, where a dozen or so men 
and women were gathered, apparently waiting for us. There the 
chair stopped. It lowered the few 
inches to the floor and we got out, 
whereupon, in a way that could 
happen only in a dream, it lifted 
just clear and drifted away to the

wall, as if parking itself. 

Clytassamine spoke to the 
group of people and indicated me. 
They nodded gravely in my direction. It seemed the polite thing 
to do, so I nodded back. Then, 
with her as interpreter, a kind of 
catechism began. 

I think it was during that 
questioning that I really began to 
feel there was something seriously 
wrong with my dream. They 
wanted to know my name, where 
I came from, what I did, what 
had happened to my legs and 
why, what war and hospital 
meant, and a great deal more, 
and the answers I gave made 
them frown baffledly and pause 
now and then to confer. 

It was all very logical and detailed, which was wrong. Dreams 
— my dreams, at any rate — have 
a more cinematic quality. They 
do not proceed in smooth sequence, but jump suddenly from 
one scene to another, as though 
directed by an erratic and impatient psychotic. But this was 
not at all like that. I was acutely 
aware of what was going on, both 
physically and mentally. 

At last Clytassamine said, 
"They wish you — learn — language. More easy to— speak." 

"That's going to take a long 
while," I said, because not a single word that any of them had 
spoken had been familiar to me. 

"No. Few tblana." 



"How much?" 

"Quarter day," she explained. 

"A lousy linguist like me? I 
wasn't even able to learn pigLatin!" 

She didn't answer or argue. She 
gave me some food — a box of 
things that looked like candy and 
tasted good. They weren't sweet 
or very big, but only a few took 
care of my hunger. 

"Now — sleep," said Clytassamine, pointing to a cold, unfriendly-looking block of the 
green stuff. 

I got on it and found that it 
was neither chilly nor hard. I lay 
there worriedly, wondering if this 
was the end of the dream and I 
would wake up to find myself 
back in my own bed, with the old 
pain where my legs ought to be. 
But I didn't wonder long. There 
must have been some drug in the 
food. 

WHEN I awoke, I was still 
there. Hanging over me was 
a kind of canopy of rose-colored 
metal which had not been there 
before. It was — I'm going to give 
up trying to describe things; there 
was too much basic unfamiliarity. 
What would an ancient Egyptian 
know of a telephone by looking at 
it? What would a Roman or a 
Greek make of a jet plane or a 
radio. And as for TV — ! 

Coming right down to the simple things, if you saw a slab of

chocolate for the first time, you 
might think it was for mending 
shoes, lighting the fire, or building 
houses. About the last use you'd 
guess for it would be eating — 
and, when you did find out, you'd 
most likely try eating soap because the texture was similar and 
the color more attractive. 

That's the way it was with me. 
You grow_up with your conditioning complete. You look at a 
machine and you don't have to 
say to yourself, "Ah, that works 
by steam, or gasoline, or electricity," because you know, and 
you generally have a good idea 
of what the machine does without having to think about it. 

But nearly all of what I was 
seeing now was foreign to me. I 
had no place to start. Not understanding what might cut or burn 
me if I touched it, I was scared 
of everything — just like a child 
or an aborigine. Naturally, I 
floundered around with wild 
guesses, but mostly they had to 
remain just that. 

I guessed now that^th'e canopy 
was part of a hypnotic teaching 
machine, something like those the 
Navy tried to use to teach Morse 
Code. I guessed that, however, 
because I found I could now understand what the people were 
saying — some of it, at least — but 
the concepts behind the language 
were totally alien. I knew only 
what I could translate directly. 



The word "thlana" that Clytassamine had used, for example, I 
now knew was a measure of time 
— one hour and twelve minutes, 
making twenty thlana to the day 
— so I'd been out about five 
thlana, almost six hours. "Dool" 
was electricity, but "laythal" 
meant nothing to me. I knew it 
was some form of power and that 
was all, not where it came from 
or what it did, though Clytassamine did her best to explain: 

"The mizmo is changed into 
frengra, and that produces laythai. But it has to be senaced, of 
course, before it can be baxtoa." 

It wasn't her fault. You try. 
explaining how coal and water 
are converted into electricity 
without using terms that are unfamiliar to an illiterate, and laythai, as I understood it, was even 
more complicated. But these difficulties had the effect of enhancing the dreamlike quality. 
The utter blankness of certain 
words or ideas which kept cropping up, like the dead keys of an 
old piano, began to get me down. 

"T^NOUGH, Clytassamine," a 
man said, when my distress 
must have begun to show pretty 
plainly. "Take him away and 
look after him." 

The relief was almost physical 
as I sat down beside her again on 
one of the flying -seats-. I sighed 
and relaxed finally as it floated

vs back once more into the open 
air. 

EVEN before I understood anything about this unfamiliar 
world, I was somewhat awed by 
Clytassamine's power of mental 
adjustment. It seemed to me that 
it must be a frightening experience, discovering that a person 
you have known for a long while 
has without warning become a 
perfect stranger — with, maybe, 
unpredictable reactions. Yet she 
showed no alarm, and only occasionally made the slip of calling me Hymorell. 

I realized why somebody recovering consciousness usually 
demands first of all, "Where am 
I?" I wanted to know that very 
much; without that information, 
I didn't seem to be able to get 
my thinking started properly. 
There was no fixed point to begin 
from. 

When we were back in the 
green room again, I began to ask 
questions. She looked at me 
doubtfully. 

"You should rest. Simply relax 
and don't worry. We will look 
after you. If I were to try to explain, I would bewilder you more." 

"You couldn't," I told her. 
"Nothing could. I've got to the 
stage where I can't pretend this 
is a dream any longer. I've got 
to get some kind of orientation 
cor go crazy." 



She looked at me closely again, 
and then nodded. "Very well. But 
where am I to begin? What is 
most urgent?" 

"I want to know where I am, 
who I am, and how it happened." 

"As to who you are, you know 
that. You told me you are Terry 
Molton." 

"But this—" I slapped my left 
thigh — "this isn't Terry Molton." 

"Temporarily it is," she said. 
"It was Hymorell's body, but 
now all the qualities that make 
it individual — mentality, personality, character — i are yours. 
Therefore, it is Terry Molton's 
body." 

"And what happened to Hyr 
morell?" 

"He has transferred to what 
was your body." 

"Then he's made a damn bad 
deal," I told her. I thought for a 
moment. "That doesn't make 
sense. I'm not the same as I was 
before I was shot up. Physical 
differences make mental differences. Injuries and dope changed 
mine to some extent — if they'd 
done it more, I'd have a completely different personality." 

"Who told you that?" 

"Common sense." 

"And your scientists postulate 
no constant? Surely there must 
be some constant factor not affected by changes. And if there 
is that factor, may it not be a 
cause rather than an effect?"

"As I understand it, it's simply 
a matter of balance — physical and 
psychological forces held in equilibrium." 

"Then you don't understand 
it," she told me. 

I decided to drop that angle 
for the moment. 

"What is this place?" I asked. 

"The building is called Cathalu." 

"No, I mean where is it? Is it 
on Earth? It looks like Earth, 
but nowhere that I ever heard 
of." 

"Of course it's Earth. Where 
else would it be? But it's in a 
different salany." 

T WAS up against another of 
•■• those blank words once more. 
Salany meant absolutely nothing 
to me. 

"Do you mean it's in a different — ?" I began, and then 
stopped, baffled. There didn't 
seem to be a word in her language 
for "time," at least in the sense 
I meant. 

"I told you it would be bewildering," she said. "You think 
differently. In terms of old thinking — as near as I can understand 
it — you come from one end of the 
human race. Now you are at the 
other." 

"But I don't," I protested. 

"There were some twenty million 

years of human evolution before 

... , » 

me. 



"Oh, that!" she said, airily dismissing those twenty million 
years with a wave of her hand. 

"Well, at least," I went on desperately, "you can tell me how 
I got here." 

"Roughly, yes. It is an experiment of Hymorell's. He has been 
trying for a long time — " in this 
straightforward sense, I noticed, 
there did seem to be a word for. 
time— "but now he has made a 
new approach. A successful one 
at last. Several times before, he 
has almost done it, but the transfer did not hold. His most successful attempts were about three 
generations ago. He — " 

"I beg your pardon?" I said. 

She looked up questioningly. 
"Yes?" 

"I thought you said he tried 
three generations ago." 
"I did." 

I got up from the block I'd 
been sitting on and looked out 
of the arched windows. It was a 
peaceful, sunny, normal-looking 
day out there. 

"Maybe you were right — I'd 
better rest," I said. 

"That's sensible," she agreed. 
"Don't bother your head about 
the hows and whys. After all, 
you won't be here long." 

"You mean, I'll be going back 
— to be as I was?' 

She nodded. 

I could feel my body under the 
unfamiliar robe. It was a good 



PIILAR TO POST 



141 



body, strong, well-kept, lithe, 
whole, and there was no pain in 
it. 

"No," I said. "I don't know 
where I am, or what I am now, 
but one thing I do know — I'm not 
going back to that hell." 

She looked at me and shook 
her head pityingly. 

fT^HE next day, after we had 
fed on more of the candies 
that were not candies, and drunk 
an elusive-flavored milky stuff, 
she led the way into the hall and 
toward the -chairs. 

I stopped. "Can't we walk? 
It's a long time since I was able 
to." 

"Why, yes, of course," she said, 
and we turned toward the doorway. Several people spoke to her, 
and one or two of them to me. 
There was curiosity in their eyes, 
but their manners were kindly, as 
though to set a stranger at ease. 
It was evident that they knew I 
was not Hymorell, yet they were 
too polite to mention it. 

Outside, we walked across 
rough grass and found a path 
leading through a thicket. It was 
quiet, peaceful, Arcadianly beautiful. To me, feeling the ground 
beneath my feet as something 
precious, everything had the 
freshness of Spring. The blood 
livened in my veins in a way that 
I had forgotten. 

"Wherever it is, it's lovely," I 



said, glancing around. 

We walked on in silence for a 
while, until my curiosity came 
back. 

"What did you mean by the 
other end of the human race?' " 
I asked her. 

"Just that. We think we are 
coming to the end, finishing. We 
are practically sure of it, though 
there is always chance." 

"I have never seen anyone 
more healthy or more beautiful," 
I said, looking straight at her. 

She smiled. "It is a nice body. 
My best, I think." 

For the moment, I ignored that 
baffling addition. "Then what is 
happening? Is it infertility?" 

"No. There are not a great 
many children, but that is more 
a result than a cause. It is that 
something in us is failing to reproduce — the thing that makes 
us human instead of merely animal. We call it malukos." 

The word translated as something like a spirit or a soul, yet 
not quite either. 

"Then the children—?" 

"Nearly all of them lack that. 
They are — feebleminded. If 
things go on this way, they will 
all be like that one day, and then 
it will be over." 

I pondered that, feeling that I 
was back in the dream again. 

"I don't know," she went on. 
"One doesn't think of the salany 
arithmetically, though there is

the perimetrical approach." 

I couldn't make sense of that. 
"Aren't there any records?" 

"Oh, yes. That is how Hymorell and I learned your language. But there are very big 
gaps. Five times, at least, the race 
all but destroyed itself. There are 
thousands of years missing from 
the records at different periods." 

"And how long is it going to 
be before it is all finished?" I 
asked. 

"We don't know that, either. 
Our task is to prolong it because 
there is always chance. It may 
happen that the intelligence factors will become strong again." 

"How do you mean, 'prolong 
it?' Prolong your own lives?" 

"We transfer. When a body begins to fail, or when it is about 
fifty years old and getting past 
its best, we choose one of the 
feebleminded and transfer to 
that. This," she added, holding 
up her perfect hand and studying 
it, "is my fourteenth body. It's a 
very nice one." 

I agreed. "But do you mean 
you can go on and on transferring?" 

"As long as there are bodies to 
transfer to." 

"But— but that's immortality.'* 
"No," she said, scornfully, 
"nothing like it. It is just prolongation. Someday, sooner or 
later, there'll . be an accident. 
That's mathematically inevitable. 



It might have been a hundred 
years ago, or it might be tomorrow—" 

"Or a thousand years hence?" I 
suggested. 

"Exactly, but one day it will 
come." 

I did not for a moment doubt 
that she was telling me the truth, 
for by this time I was prepared 
for any fantastic situation. All the 
same, I revolted against it. I had 
an instinctive sense of disapproval — prejudice, of course, the 
same prejudice which made me 
disapprove of the soft, flowing 
garments and the soft, easy manner of life. I couldn't help feeling 
that the process she spoke of was 
allied to cannibalism in some 
symbolic fashion. 

SHE must have read my expression, for she said, explaining, not excusing: "This body 
wasn't any good to the girl who 
had it. I don't suppose she was 
really even conscious of it. It was 
being wasted. I shall look after 
it. I shall have children. Some of 
them may be normal human children. When they grow old, they 
will be able to transfer. The urge 
to survival still exists, you see. 
Something may happen; someone 
may make a discovery to save us 
even now." 

"And the girl who had this 
body? What happened to her?" 
"Well, she had very little be

yond a few instincts. What there 
was changed places with me." 

"Into a body aged fifty? Losing 
thirty years of life?" 

"Can you call it loss when she 
was incapable of using it?" 

I did not reply to that, for a 
thought had struck me. "So that's 
what Hymorell was working on! 
He was trying to transfer normal 
personalities from the past into 
feebleminded bodies! That's it, 
isn't it?" 

She looked at me steadily. 
"He's been successful at last. It 
is a real transference this time." 

I was strangely unsurprised. I 
suppose I had been working up 
to the realization before it actually came. But there was a lot 
I wanted to know about the why 
and how as I was affected. I 
asked her for more details. 

"Hymorell wanted to get as far 
as possible," she told me. "The 
limit was the point where he 
could be sure of assembling the 
parts to make an instrument that 
would get him back here. If he 
went too far in history, certain 
essential metals would not be 
known, instruments would be inaccurate, electric power' unavailable. In that case, it might take 
him years to build the instrument, if he could do it at all. 
The use of nuclear fission was the 
line he decided to draw. Further 
away than that, he thought, 
might be dangerous. - " 



"Then he had to find a contact. 
It had to be a subject where the 
integration was not good — where 
there was a lesion weakening the 
attachment of the personality to 
the physical shape. When we perform the operation, we can prepare the subject, which is easy. 
But he had to find one already 
in a suitable state. Unfortunately, 
those he could find were nearly 
all on the point of death, but he 
found you at last and then he had 
to study the strength of your tie 
to life. He was puzzled because 
it fluctuated a great deal." 

"That would be the dope," I 
suggested: 

"Possibly. Anyway, he worked 
out a rhythmic incidence of 
lesion, and then tried. This is the 
result." 

"I see," I said. "How long did 
he figure it would take him to 
build the instrument for his return?" 

"He couldn't tell that. It depends on his facilities for as» 
sembling materials." 

"Then it's going to take him 
quite a while, I'd say. A legles6 
cripple wasn't a convenient subject to choose, from that point of 
view." 

"But he'll do it." 

"Not if I can help it," I told 
her. 

She shook her head. "Once you 
have transferred, you never can 
have the perfect integration you 



144 




 




had with your own body. If at 
no other time, he will put on 
more power and get at you when 
you're sleeping." 

"We'll see about that," I said. 

Afterward, I saw the instrument that Hymorell had used for 
the transfer. It was not large. In 
appearance, it was little more 
than a liquid-filled lens mounted 
upon a box the size of a portable 
typewriter, from which protruded 



two polished metal handles. But 
within the box there was enough 
intricacy of wiring, tubes, and 
strange gadgets to fill me with 
great satisfaction. No one, I said 
to myself, was going to knock a 
thing like that together in a few 
days, or even a few weeks.

istic was, at first, restful. After 
that came periods when I wanted 
to go wild and break up something just for the diversion. 

Clytassamine took me here and 
there in the great green building. 
There were concerts at which I 
understood not a thing. I sat 
•there, bored and musing to myself while around me the audience 
went into an intellectual trance, 
finding something in the strange 
scales and queerer harmonies 
that was utterly beyond my perception. 

And there was one hall where 
colors played on a large fluorescent screen. They seemed to be 
projected from the spectators 
themselves in some incomprehensible way. Everybody but me 
enjoyed it. You could feel that. 
And now and then, for no reason 
that I could perceive, they 
would all sigh or laugh together. 
Nevertheless, I thought some of 
the effects very pretty, and said 
so. By the way it was received, 
it was the wrong thing to say. 

Only in the performances of 
three-dimensionally projected 
plays was I occasionally able to 
follow the action for a while — 
and when I thought I could, it 
usually shook me badly. 

Clytassamine became impatient with my comments. "How 
can you expect to feel when you 
measure civilized behavior by 
primitive taboos?" she asked. 



She took me to a museum. It 
was not like any I had thought of, 
being mostly a collection of instruments projecting sound or 
images, or both, according to 
selection. I saw some horrible 
things. We went back, back, and 
still further back in time. I 
■wanted to see or hear something 
of my own time. 

"There's only sound," she said. 

"All right," I told her. "Let's 
have music." 

She worked at the keyboard of 
the machine. Into that great hall, 
a familiar sound stole softly and 
mournfully. As I listened to it, I 
had a sense of emptiness and vast 
desolation. Memories flooded 
back as if the old world — not, 
oddly enough, the one I had left, 
but that in which I was a child — ■ 
were suddenly around me. A 
wave of sentimentality, of overwhelming self-pity and nostalgia 
for all the hopes and joys and 
childhood that had vanished utterly engulfed me, and the tears 
streamed down my face. 

I did not go to that museum 
again. And the music which conjured a whole world up from the 
aged dust? No, it was not a Beethoven symphony, nor a Mozart 
concerto. 

It was The Old Folks At Home. 

"rvO you never work? Does 
nobody work?" I asked 
Clytassamine. 



144 




 



"Oh, yes, if we want to." 

"But what about the unpleasant things — the things that must 
be done?" 

"What things?" she asked, puzzled. 

"Well, growing food, providing 
power, making clothes, building, 
transportation . . ." 

She looked surprised. 

"Why, naturally, the machines 
do all that. You wouldn't expect 
men to do those things." 

"But who looks after the machines and keeps them in order?" 

"Themselves, of course. A 
mechanism that couldn't maintain itself wouldn't be a machine. 
It would be just a form of tool." 

"Oh," I said. And I supposed 
it would, though the thought was 
new to me. 

"Do you mean to say," I went 
on, "that for your fourteen generations — some four hundred 
years or so— you've done nothing 
but this?" 

"Well, I've had quite a lot of 
babies. Three of them were quite 
normal. And I've worked on 
eugenic research from time to 
time. Almost everybody does 
when he thinks he's got a lead." 

"But how can you stand it, 
just going on and on?" 

"It is not easy sometimes and 
some of us do give up, but that 
is a crime, because there is always chance. And it's not quite 
so monotonous as you think. 



Each transfer makes a difference. 
You feel as if the world had become a different place then. Even 
in one body, tastes can change 
quite a lot in one lifetime, and 
they inevitably differ between 
bodies. But you are the same 
person, yet you are young again. 
You're hopeful, the world looks 
brighter, you think you'll be 
wiser this time. And then you 
fall in love again, just as sweetly 
and foolishly as before. It's wonderful, like a rebirth. You can 
know just how wonderful only 
if you have been fifty and then 
become twenty." 

"I can guess," I said. "I was 
worse than just being fifty before this happened. But love? 
For four years, I haven't dared to 
think of love . . ." 

"You dare now," she said. 
"Can't you?" 
■1 could. I did. 

THERE was so much I wanted 
to know. "What happened to 
my world?" I asked her later. 
"It seemed pretty well headed for 
disaster, as I saw it. I suppose it 
nearly wiped itself out in some

vast and destructive global war?" 

"It just died, the same as all 
the early civilizations. Nothing 
spectacular." 

I thought of my world, its intricacies and complexities, the 
mastery of distance and speed, 
the progress of science. 

"Just died?" I repeated. "It 
can't have. There must have been 
something that broke it up." 

"Oh, no. The passion for order 
is a manifestation of the deep desire for security. The desire is 
natural, but the attainment is 
fatal. There was the means to 
produce a static world, which 
was achieved. When the need for 
adaptation arose, it found itself 
unable to adapt. It inertly died 
of discouragement. That happened to many primitive peoples before." 

She had no reason to lie. but 
it was hard to believe. 

"We hoped for so much," I 
protested. "Everything was opening before us. We were learning. 
We were going to reach out to 
other planets and beyond." 

"Ingenious you certainly were, 
but each new discovery was a toy. 
You never considered its true 
worth. And you were a greedy, 
childishly aggressive people. You 
developed science without developing philosophy. Philosophy 
without science is fruitless speculation, likely to degenerate into 
superstition and ignorant quib


bling. But science without philosophy is equally fruitless research that leads to pedantry, 
stasis, dogma." 

"That's rather hard on us. We 
had very complex problems." 

"Mostly concerned with preservation of forms and habits. It 
never seems to have occurred to 
you that in Nature life is growth, 
and preservation is an accident. 
What is preserved in the rocks or 
in ice is only the image of life, 
but you were always regarding 
local taboos as eternal verities." 

My mind switched suddenly to 
my present situation. "But suppose I were to go back and tell 
them what is going to happen. It 
would alter things. Doesn't that 
show I'm not going back?" 

She smiled. "You think they 
would listen to you while they 
neglect philosophy, Terry?" 

"Anyway," I said, "I don't intend to go back. I don't like your 
world. I think it is decadent, and 
in many ways immoral, but at 
least I am a whole human being 
here." 

She shook her head. "So young, 
Terry. So sure of right and wrong. 
It's rather sweet." 

"It's not sweet at all," I said, 
brusquely. "There have to be 
standards. Without standards, 
where are you?" 

"Well, where? Where's a tree, 
or a flower, or a butterfly?" 

"We're more than plants." 



148 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"What do you do about opposing standards? Go gloriously to 
war?" 

I dropped that. 

"Did we get to other planets?" 
I asked. 

"I&>, but the next civilization 
did. They found Mars too old, 
Venus too young. You had a 
dream of men spreading out over 
the Universe; I'm afraid that 
never happened, though it was 
tried again later. They bred men 
specially for it as they bred them 
for all kinds of things. In fact, 
they produced some very strange 
men and women, highly specialized, who were even more zealous 
for order than your people — they 
would not admit chance, which is 
a great stupidity. When their end 
came, it was disastrous. None of 
the specialized types could survive. The population dwindled 
down to a few hundred thousand" 
who had enough adaptability to 
start over again." 

"So you have come to distrust 
order and standards?" 

"We have ceased to think of 
society as a structural engineering problem, or of individuals as 
components for assembly into 
some arbitrary pattern." 

"And you just sit and wait supinely for the end?" 

"Oh, no! We preserve ourselves 
as material for chance to work 
on. Life was an accident in the 
beginning; ^survival has often 



been an accident. Maybe there'll 
be no more accidents. On the 
other hand, there may." 

"That sounds very near defeatism." 

"In the end, defeat and the 
cold must come. First to the Solar System, then the Galaxy, then 
the Universe, and the rest will be 
silence. Not to admit that is a 
foolish vanity." She paused. "Yet 
one grows flowers because they 
are lovely, not because one wishes 
them to live for ever." 

T did not like that world. It was 
-* as foreign as another planet 
might have been. The strain to 
understand was constant and 
wearisome; it was also unprofitable. Whatever comfort and ease 
I had there were centered in 
Clytassamine. For her I pulled 
down the barriers I had so bitterly erected around myself in the 
last few years, and I fell the more 
deeply in love on account of 
them. 

Thus there was a second reason not to let things happen as 
Hymorell had planned. Even 
Clytassamine could not make the 
place heaven, but I had got out 
of hell and I intended to stay out. 

I spent unnumbered hours poring over the .transference machine, learning all I could of it. 
My progress was slow, but some 
idea of the way it operated did 
begin at last to come to me. 


But I could not settle. The 
feeling of transience would not 
leave me, and the days began to 
pass in long, nagging uncertainty. 
There was no way of telling 
whether Hymorell would be successful in getting all the equipment he needed. I had a haunting, 
mind's-eye picture of him in my 
wheelchair, working away on the 
contrivance which would condemn me to suffering in that 
broken body again. 

As the weeks went by, the 
strain began to affect me, and I 
grew tense. I was afraid to go to 
sleep lest the next time I woke 
I should find myself back in that 
chair. 

Clytassamine, too, began to 
look worried. Her genuine sympathy over my distress at the id£a 
of going back was confused by 
her feeling for Hymorell, who 
must now be suffering what I 
had. There was also the fact that 
my mental strain wasn't doing 
my temporary body any good, 
either. 

And then, when six uneventful months had begun to give me 
hope, it happened without sign or 
warning. I went to sleep in the 
room of the great green building; 
I woke back home — with a 
raging pain in my missing leg. 

All was just as it had been. So 
much so that I reached right 
away for the dope bottle. 

When I grew calmer, I found 



ISO 




 



something which had not been 
there before. It was on the table 
beside me, looking like a radio set 
partially assembled. I certainly 
had not built it. Except for that, 
the whole thing might have been 
a dream. 

I leaned back in my chair, 
considering that mass of wiring 
very carefully. Then I started to 
examine it closely, touching 
nothing. It was, of course, crude 
in construction, compared with the 
transference machine I had studied in the place that Clytassamine 
had called Cathalu, but I began 
to see similarities and notice 
adaptations. I was still looking 
at it when I fell asleep. 

By the number of hours I slept, 
I knew Hymorell must have been 
driving my body without letup. 

WHEN I awoke, I began to 
think frantically. My spell 
of soundness and health had left 
me with one firm decision — I 
would not remain an amputee. 

There were two ways out. The 
first, the dope bottle, had always 
been there for the taking and still 
was. But now there was the transference instrument. 

I did not understand a • lot 
about it. I doubted whether I 
could successfully retune it if I 
tried, and I did not wish to try. 
For one thing, little though I 
liked that other world, Clytassamine would be there to help me. 
For another, what I had learned 
made me think that I might 
easily land somewhere even less 
desirable. So I left it on Hymorell's setting. 

The chief difficulty I foresaw 
was that the machine must remain. He had had to leave it, 
but had never guessed, I suppose, 
that I'd be able to use it. And if I 
were to use it, I'd have to leave it 
there for him to use again. My 
object must be to stop him doing 
that. 

It would be risky to set the 
machine to destroy itself after I 
changed places with him. The 
process is to some extent hypnotic 
and by no means instantaneous. 
Something very queer indeed 
would be likely to happen if it 
were destroyed while the transmission was in progress. 

Besides, he would be able to 
build another. As long as he existed, he would be able to. 

That made the answer fairly 
obvious. 

When I had made my plan, I 
tried the instrument several times, 
but he was awake and wary. I 
saw that I would have to catch 
him asleep, as he had caught me, 
so I went on trying at intervals 
of four hours. 

I don't know whether he outguessed me or whether he was 
just lucky. I had got hold of the 
poison a year before to keep by 
me in case things became unbear


able. My first idea was to swallow 
it in a capsule which would take 
some little time to dissolve. But 
then I realized what would happen if something went wrong and 
I could not make the transfer in 
time. That scared away from the 
scheme. Instead, I poured the 
poison into the dope bottle. The 
crystals were white, just like the 
dope itself, only a little larger. 

Once I got a response from the 
instrument, it was easier than I 
had expected. I took hold of the 
two handles and concentrated all 
my attention on the lens. I felt 
giddy. The room swayed and 
blurred. 

When it cleared, I was back 
in that green room, with Clytassamine beside me. 

I reached my hand toward her, 
and then stopped, for I could 
hear her quietly crying. I had 
never known her to do that before. 

"What's the matter?" I asked. 

For a moment she went absolutely quiet. Then she said, incredulously: "It's — it's Terry?'" 

"Well, sure. I told you I wasn't 
going to be kept back there." 

She started to cry again, but 
differently. I put my arm around 
her. 

After a while, I asked: "What 
is it? What's all this about?" 

She sniffed. "It's Hymorell. 
Your world has done something 
dreadful to him. When he came 



152 




 



back, he was harsh and bitter. 
He kept talking of pain and 
suffering. I was afraid of him; 
he was — cruel." 

It did. not greatly surprise me, 
for they knew nothing of illness 
• and physical discomfort. If a 
body became in the least defective, the^ transferred. They had 
never had to learn to bear suffering. 

"Why didn't it do that to you, 
too?" she asked. 

"I think it did at first," I admitted. "But you find out after 
a while that that just makes 
things tougher." 

"I was afraid of him; he was 
cruel," she repeated. 

¥ kept myself awake for forty■■- eight hours, to make sure. I 
knew that one of the first things 
he would need when he woke was 
the dope, but I had to give him 
time to take it. Then I let myself 
sleep. 

When I opened my eyes, I was 
back in the hospital. It was no 
slow awakening. I knew in a 
flash that he had somehow suspected the bottle of poison and 
avoided it. The instrument was 
beside me and I saw a thfh curl 
of smoke rising from it, as though 
a cigarette had been left burning. 
I began to reach toward it, but 
then caution checked me. I 
caught the leads and pulled them 
out. In among the wiring, I found 



a small can with a glowing fuse 
attached. I flung the can hastily 
through the window. He too, 
Jiowever, had had to allow a safety margin : it was half an hour 
before the explosive went off. 

I looked at the dope, I needed 
it badly, but I didn't dare to 
touch it. I trundled my chair 
over to the cupboard where the 
spare supply was kept. When I 
took out the bottle, though, I 
hesitated. It looked like the real 
stuff and intact — but then, of 
course, it was essential that it 
should. 

Deliberately, I threw it into the 
fireplace, smashing the bottle, 
and wheeled my chair to the telephone. The doctor was pretty 
nasty to me, but he came, bringing the stuff with him, thank 
God. 

Various plans occurred to me. 
A poisoned needle, for instance, 
set strategically in the arm of the 
chair. But the disabled have so 
little privacy. It is difficult 
enough to get the deadlier poisons, 
anyway; when it can be done 
only by finding a third party 
ready to break the law, it becomes virtually impossible. And 
if someone did do it for me, he 
would later appear as an accessory to suicide. The same objection applied to laying my hands 
on a few sticks of dynamite. But 
I could buy a time-switch without any trouble — and I did.

It was, I thought, a neat 
arrangement. My old Army pistol 
was trained on the exact position 
my head would occupy when- I 
was at the instrument. Only if 
you were searching for it would 
you notice the muzzle looking 
out from the bookshelves. It was 
fixed to fire when the two handles 
of the instrument were grasped — 
but not until the time-switch was 
on. Thus I could set the switch 
and operate the instrument. Two 
hours later, for safe margin, the 
switch would go over and the 
thing became lethal. If I tried 
and failed to make contact. I had 
only to set the switch again. 

I waited three days, knowing 
that Hymorell would be as wary 
of sleep as I had been, and uncertain whether his little grenade 
had been successful. Then I tried 
successfully. 

But three- days later, I was 
back again in my chair. 

HYMORELL, damn him, was 
cautious; he must have spotted the extra lead to the switch 
right away. It had been snipped 
off. 

But I found his little surprise 
package too — I would have 
melted the instrument, and most 
likely myself along with it, if I 
had touched it before disconnecting. (The switch was thermostatic this time, set to cut in as the 
room cooled down — very neat.) 



The pistol and the time-switch 
had vanished, and I set about 
looking for them everywhere 
within range of my chair. I didn't 
find the pistol, but the switch was 
in the cupboard under the stairs. 
It was arranged to set off a percussion cap which would ignite 
a gray powder obviously taken 
from the pistol cartridges. There 
were paper and oily rags close by. 

Once I had made sure there 
were no other boobytraps around. 
I settled down to work out another little reception device of my 
own. I had been caught by a type 
of mine the Germans used which 
didn't go up until the seventh 
truck had passed over it. The 
idea had its points. 

I spent a couple of days fixing 
that. The transference machine, 
meanwhile, created other problems. I changed places with Hymorell, then returned involuntarily, and got back there again. 

I was getting sick of the game, 
but it seemed to be a duel which 
could only end with one of us 
outsmarting the other. It was a 
stupid battle with too many risks 
for both of us. And neither of us 
dared to sleep. 

"Look here," I said to Clytassamine. "Suppose I were to transfer to one of the feebleminded the 
way you people do. Then when 
Hymorell operates again, it will 
be the halfwit who will take my 
place in the chair. We'll both be

here and the whole thing will be 
solved." 

She shook her head. "You need 
some sleep, Terry. You're getting 
fuddled. It's your mind he's working the exchange with. It wouldn't make any difference what 
kind of body you were using." 

She was right, of course — I 
was fuddled. On the third day. 
I just had to sleep. It lasted 
about fourteen of their hours and 
I woke up in the green hall. 

I couldn't believe he'd let that 
length of time pass without making an attempt, if he were in any 
condition to do so. My little gadget must have gotten rid of him 
this time. 

I began to feel easier. 

AS the days went on, I grew 
sure of my success. My dread 
of sleep diminished. At last I 
began to feel like a citizen of 
this other world and to look for 
my place in it. With unlimited 
time ahead of me, I didn't intend 
to spend it hanging around the 
way the rest of them did. 

"Maybe there is only chance 
now," I said to Clytassamine, 
"but didn't you ever hear of 
making chances?" 

She smiled, it seemed to me, a 
little wearily. 

"Yes," she admitted, "I know. 
I felt like that for my first two 
generations. You are so young, 
Terry." She sat looking at me

wistfully and a little sadly. 

Why the change should suddenly have come over me then, I 
can't say. Maybe it wasn't that 
sudden, but had been working 
up a while; as I looked back at 
her, I found myself seeing her 
quite differently. A cold feeling 
came over me. I saw beyond her 
perfect form and young loveliness. 

Inside, she was old — old and 
wearied — old far beyond my 
reach. She thought of me as a 
child, and had been treating me 
as one. The vigor of my true 
youth had amused her. Perhaps 
it revived her own for a while. 
Now she was tired of it and of 
me. The freshness I had seen was 
nothing but a sham. 

I must have stared at her quite 
a while. "You don't want me any 
more. You want Hymorell." 

"Yes, Terry," she admitted 
quietly. 

For the next day or two I 
pondered over what to do. I had 
never liked that world. It was 
effete and decaying. What pleasantness there had been had vanished. I felt imprisoned, stifled, 
appalled at the prospect of 
spending several lifetimes in it. 

Now that a return to my 
former torment seemed improbable, the prospect here looked, in 
another way, little better. I began 
to wonder whether mortality, 
wasn't one of life's more desirable 
qualities. It's frightening in most 



ways, but more frightening was 
the prospect of an almost eternal 
existence. You can't believe that 
until you're faced with it. 

But my worry was unnecessary; I'm in no danger of immortality or anything like it. I went to 
sleep despondently in the great 
green building, and when I awoke 
I was in this mental institution 
instead of either the future or the 
hospital. And I wasn't in either 
Hymorell's body or my own — 
/ was in somebody e/se's.' 

THERE was a male attendant 
nearby, cleaning up around 
the bed. I knew better than to ask 
where and who I was; I had to 
get oriented first, on my own, 
without arousing comment or 
getting into whatever kind of 
trouble Hymorell might have 
cooked up for me. So I just lay 
there, watching the attendant. 

But he turned around and saw 
my eyes on him. He gave a start, 
began approaching the bed, then 
abruptly ducked out. He came 
back a little later with a doctor, 
who lifted my lids and stared at 
the pupils, tried my reflexer and 
finally stood erect, his arms folded grimly while he stared at me. 
"What's your name?" he asked. 
I didn't answer. 
"Do you know where you are?" 
"In a hospital," I said. 
"Remember how you got here?" 
As a matter o4 fact, I wasn't 

156 



sure at all. Until I was, I had no 
intention of talking. That didn't 
stop them from putting me 
through a whole series of tests. 
By the time they finished, I realized why my silence hadn't accomplished anything. 

Hymorell had transferred me 
to the body of a feebleminded 
man named Stephen Dallboy. 
When the male attendant had 
turned and seen the light of intelligence in Dallboy's eyes, it 
hadn't mattered whether I spoke 
or not, and the tests had amazed 
the doctors because, not knowing 
the situation, I had given normal 
responses. All except my name. 

I don't altogether understand 
how Hymorell worked the stunt. 
He must have been as tired as I 
was of the dangerous game we'd 
been playing. The way I see it, he 
probably built another transference machine and used it to locate some accessible body in the 
present. That would be easy — 
just think of the number of patients in mental institutions he 
had to choose from ! He happened 
to pick this Stephen Dallboy, a 
congenital imbecile, transferred 
me into that body, and presumably transferred himself back into 
his own in the future. 

Then what had happened to my 
body? Stephen Dallboy must be 
in it, naturally. Being feebleminded, he wouldn't even try 
to work the apparatus, and I was confined to the asylum, unable 
to get to the machine. 

It was a shrewd solution, taking me completely away from the 
transfer instrument but it got me 
sore' He could have transferred 
me into a body that wasn't under 
confinement, couldn't he? More 
important, though, Dallboy was 
a charity case, whereas I'd inherited money — not much, but 
enough to make a difference — 
and I would- need it if I could 
ever get out of the institution. 

I wrote a letter, signing it 
Stephen Dallboy, and asked 
about Terry Molton, whom I 
claimed as an acquaintance. The 
male attendant mailed it for me; 
I'd counted on him as a possible 
ally and won his friendship by 
playing chess with him. 

The answer came back from 
the hospital, stating that Terry 
Molton was dead. He had apparently electrocuted himself with 
some experimental radio apparatus. The resulting fuse had started a fire in the room, which had 
been discovered and put out before it could spread, but not in 
time to save Molton. 

Well, what did that signify? 
The fire had been detected about 
three hours after I had awakened 
to find myself in this asylum. Did 
that mean Hymorell deliberately 
set the boobytrap to destroy the 
equipment and Dallboy along 
with it, so I or anybody else 



wouldn't be able to pull him 
back into the present ... or was 
it Hymorell who died in my body 
while Dallboy, still imbecilic, was 
in Hymorell's in the future? 

I decided it didn't make a 
damned bit of difference. Getting 
even with somebody who won't 
be born for maybe thousands of 
years makes no sense, especially 
for* some poor guy to whom being 
alive or dead was the same thing. 
And my immediate situation is 
one hell of a lot more urgent. 

If I pretend to be Stephen 
Dallboy, I am an imbecile committed to an asylum . . . and I 
can't get back my own money. 
If I claim to be Terry Molton, I 
can be proved insane . . . and I 
still can't collect my money. I 
don't know what to do, except 
convince the doctors here that 
I'm normal enough to be released. 

That wouldn't be so bad, come 
to thing of it, money or no money. 
I at least have all the parts of a 
passable body now. And I ought 
to be able to use this body profitably in the kind of world I understand. So I've gained a lot more 
than I lost. 

Nevertheless, I am Terry 
Molton. 

~T\ALLBOY'S, as you will realize, is a well integrated hallucination; but if there is nothingmore serious we shall undoubtedly have to release the patient

in due course, as we see fit. 

However, we do feel that we 
should acquaint you with one or 
two discrepant points. One is that, 
although the two men appear 
never to have met, Stephen Dallboy is informed in remarkably intimate detail of Terence Molton's 
affairs. Another is that, when confronted for test purposes with two 
friends of Molton's, he immediately addressed them by name 
and seemed to know all about 
them — to their great astonish


ment, for they have never to 
their knowledge met him before. 
■ Also, they state he does not in the 
least resemble Terence Molton. 

Nevertheless, you will find 
herewith full legal proof that the 
patient is indeed Stephen Dallboy. Should there be any further 
developments, we will keep you 
advised. 

Yours truly, 
Jesse K. Johnson
