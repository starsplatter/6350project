dered irritably why those duties 
couldn't be done by a man, 

He paused to examine the contents of his tobacco pouch and 
made a mental calculation. At 
two pipefuls a day, he could 
stretch it to next quota day. 

Then Baley stepped out from 
behind his railing — he'd earned a 
railed corner two years ago — and 
walked the length of the common 
room. 

Simpson looked up from a 
mere-pool file as he passed. 
"Boss wants you, Lije." 

"I know. R. Sammy told me." 

A closely coded tape reeled out 
of the mere-pool's vitals as the 
small instrument searched and 
analyzed its "memory" for the 
desired information, which was 
stored in the tiny vibration patterns of the gleaming mercury 
surface within. 

"I'd kick R. Sammy's armored 
behind if I weren't afraid of 
breaking a leg," said Simpson. "I 
saw Yi nc e Barrett the other day." 

Baley's long face grew longer. 
"How's he doing?" 

"Working a deli very -tread on 
the yeast farms. He asked if there 
was any chance he could get his 
job back. Qr any job in the Department. What could I tell him? 
R. Sammy's doing Vince's job 
now and that's that. A damned 
shame. Vince is a bright kid. 
Everyone liked him." 

Baley shrugged. "It's some


thing we're all living through," he 
said in a manner stiffer than he 
intended or felt. He'd liked Vince, 
too, and hated the vacantly grinning robot that had replaced the 
boy. His own foot had itched in 
much the same fashion as Simpson's. Not just for R. Sammy, 
either. For any of the damned 
robots. 

THE boss rated a private office. It said JULIUS ENDERBY on the clouded glass. Nice 
letters, but individually removable. The rest underneath, "Commissioner of Police, City of New 
York," was carefully etched into 
the glass. The jobs were permanent; the job-holders were not. 
And with robots taking over more 
and more human occupations — 
Baley stepped into the office 
and said, "You want to see me, 
Commissioner?" 

Enderby looked up. He wore 
spectacles because his eyes were 
sensitive and couldn't take the 
usual contact lenses. It was only 
after one got used to the sight 
of them that one could take in the 
rest of the face, which was quite 
undistinguished. Baley had a 
strong notion that the Commissioner valued his glasses for the 
personality they lent him and 
suspected that his eyeballs 
weren't as sensitive as all that. 

The Commissioner looked definitely nervous. He straightened 



6 




 



his cuffs, leaned back, and said, 
too heartily, "Sit down, Lije. Sit 
down." 

Baley sat down stiffly and 
waited. 

Enderby said, "How's Jessie 
and the boy?" 

"Fine," said Baley hollowly. 
"Just fine. And your family?" 

"Fine," echoed Enderby. "Just 
fine." 

It had been a false start. 

Baley thought: Something's 
wrong with his face. 

He said, "Commissioner, I wish 
you wouldn't send R. Sammy out 
after me." 

"Well, you know how I feel 
about those things, Lije. But he's 
been put here and I've got to use 
him for something." 
. "It's uncomfortable, Commissioner. He tells me you want me 
and then he stands there. I have 
to tell him to go or he just keeps 
on standing there." 

"Oh, that's my fault, Lije. I 
gave him the message to deliver 
and forgot to tell him specifically 
to get back to his job when he 
was through." 

Baley sighed. The fine wrinkles 
about his intensely brown eyes 
grew more pronounced. "Anyway 
you wanted to see me." 

"Yes, Lije," said the Commissioner, "but not for anything 
easy.'* 

He stood up, turned away, and 
walked to the wall behind his 



desk. He touched an inconspicuous contact -switch and a section of the wall grew transparent. 

Baley blinked at the unexpected insurge of grayish light. 

The Commissioner smiled. "I 
had this specially arranged last 
year, Lije. I don't think I've 
shown it to you before. Come 
over here and take a look. In the 
old days, all rooms had things 
like this. They were called 'windows.' Did you know that?" 

"I've heard of them," Baley 
said. He had viewed many historical novels. 

"Come here." 

Baley squirmed, but did as he 
was told. There was something 
indecent about exposing the privacy of a room to the outside 
world. Sometimes the Commissioner carried his affectation of 
Medievalism to a drastic extreme. 

Like his glasses, Baley thought. 

That was it! That was what 
made him look wrong! 

T> ALEY said, "Pardon me, 
Commissioner, but you're 
wearing new glasses, aren't you?" 

The Commissioner stared at 
him in mild surprise, took off his 
glasses, looked at them and then 
at Baley. Without his glasses, 
his round face seemed rounder 
and his chin a trifle more pronounced. He looked vaguer, too, 
as his eyes failed to focus properly


THE CAVES OF STEEL

"Yes." He put his glasses back 
on his nose, then added with real 
anger, "I broke my old ones three 
days ago. What with one thing 
and another, I wasn't able to replace them till this morning. Lije, 
those three days were hell." 

"On account of the glasses?" 

"And other things, too. I'm getting to that." 

He turned to the window and 
so did Baley. With mild shock, 
Baley realized it was raining. For 
a minute, he was lost in the spectacle of water dropping from the 
sky, while the Commissioner exuded a kind of pride, as though 
the phenomenon were a matter of 
his own arranging. 

"This is the third time this 
month I've watched it rain. Quite 
a sight, don't you think?" 

Against his will, Baley had to 
admit to himself that it was impressive. In his forty-two years, 
he had rarely seen rain or any of 
the phenomena of nature, for that 
matter. 

He said, "It always seems a 
waste for all that water to come 
down on the city. It should restrict itself to the reservoirs." 

"Lije," said the Commissioner, 
"you're a Modernist. That's 
your trouble. In Medieval times, 
people lived in the open. I don't 
mean on the farms only. I mean 
in the cities, too. Even in New 
York. When it rained, they didn't 
think of it as waste. They gloried 



in it. They lived close to nature. 
It's healthier, better. The troubles 
of modern life come from being 
divorced from nature. Read up 
on the Coal Century sometime." 

Baley had. He had heard many 
people moaning about the invention of the atomic pile. He 
moaned about it himself when 
things went wrong, or when he 
got tired. Moaning like that was 
a built-in facet of human nature. 
Back in the Coal Century, people 
moaned about the invention of 
the steam engine. In one of 
Shakespeare's plays, a character 
moaned about the invention of 
gunpowder. A thousand years in 
the future, they'd be moaning 
about the invention of other 
things. 

The hell with it. 

He said, grimly, "Look, 
Julius." It wasn't his habit to get 
friendly with the Commissioner 
during office hours, however 
many "Lije"s the Commissioner 
threw at him, but something 
special seemed called for here. 
"You're talking about everything 
except what I came in here for 
and it's worrying me. What is 
it?" 

The Commissioner said, "I'll 
get to it, Lije. Let me do it my 
way. It's trouble." 

"Sure. What isn't on this planet? More trouble with the Rs?" 

"In a way, yes, Lije. I stand 
here and wonder how much more 



8 




 



trouble the old world can take. 
When I put in this window, I 
wasn't just letting in the sky 
once in a while. I let in the City. 
I look at it and I wonder what 
will become of it in another century." 

T IJE BALEY felt repelled by 
the other's sentimentality, 
but he found himself staring outward in fascination. Even dimmed by the weather, the City was 
a tremendous thing to see. The 
Police Department was in the 
upper levels of City Hall, and 
City Hall reached high. From the 
Commissioner's window, the 
neighboring towers fell short and 
the tops were visible. They were 
so many fingers, groping upward. 
Their walls were blank, featureless. They were the outer shells 
of a giant human hive. 

"In a way," said the Commissioner, "I'm sorry it's raining. 
We can't see Spacetown." 

Baley looked westward, but the 
horizon had closed down. New 
York's towers grew misty and 
came to an end against blank 
whiteness. 

"I know what Spacetown is 
like," Baley replied. 

"I like the picture from here," 
said the Commissioner. "It can 
just be made out in the gap between the two Brunswick Sectors. 
Low domes spread out. It's the 
difference between us and the 



Spacers. We reach high and 
crowd close. With them, each 
family has a dome for itself. One 
family, one house. And land between each dome. Have you ever 
spoken to any of the Spacers, 
Lije?" 

"A few times. About a month 
ago, I spoke to one right here on 
your intercom." 

"Yes, I remember. But then 
I'm just getting philosophical. 
We and they — different ways of 
life." 

Baley's stomach was beginning 
to constrict a little. The more 
devious the Commissioner's approach, the deadlier he suspected 
might be the conclusion. 

He said, "All right. But what's 
so surprising about it? You can't 
spread eight billion people over 
Earth in little domes. They've 
got space on their worlds, so let 
them live their way." 

The Commissioner walked to 
his chair and sat down. His eyes 
looked unblinkingly at Baley, 
shrunken a bit by the concave 
lenses in his spectacles. He said, 
"Not everyone is that tolerant 
about differences in culture. 
Either among us or among the 
Spacers." 

"All right. So what?" 

"Three days ago, a Spacer 
died." 

Now it was coming. The corners of Baley's thin lips tightened 
a trifle, but the effect upon his 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



long, sad face was unnoticeable. 
He said, "Too bad. Something 
contagious, I hope. A virus. A 
cold, perhaps." 

The Commissioner looked 
startled. "What are you talking 
about?" 

Baley didn't care to explain. 
The efficiency with which the 
Spacers had bred disease out of 
their societies was well known. 
The care with which they avoided 
contact with disease-riddled 
Earthmen, as far as possible, was 
even better known. But, then, 
sarcasm was lost on the Commissioner. 

"I'm just talking," Baley said. 
"What did he die of?" He turned 
back to the window. 

The Commissioner said, "He 
died of a missing chest. Someone 
had used a blaster on him." 

T>ALEY'S back grew rigid. He 
■*-*asked, without turning, "What 
are you talking about?" 

"You're a plainclothesman. 
You know what murder is." 

Baley abruptly turned. "But a 
Spacer! Three days ago?" 

"Yes." 

"Who did it? How?" 
"The Spacers say it was an 
Earthman." 
"It can't be" 

"Why not? You don't like the 
Spacers. I don't. Who on Earth 
does? Someone didn't like them 
a little too much, that's all." 



"Sure, but — " 

"There was the fire at the Los 
Angeles factories. There was the 
Berlin R-smashing. There were 
the riots in Shanghai," 

"Well?" 

"It all points to rising discontent. Maybe to some sort of organization." 

Baley said, "Commissioner, I 
don't get this. Are you testing me 
for some reason?" 

The Commissioner looked honestly bewildered. 

"Three days ago, a Spacer was 
murdered and the Spacers think 
the murderer is an Earthman. 
Till now, nothing's come out. Is 
that right? Commissioner, that's 
unbelievable. A thing like this 
would blow New York off the 
face of the planet if it really 
happened !" 

The Commissioner shook his 
head. "It's not as simple as that. 
Look, Lije, I've been away three 
days. I've been in conference with 
the Mayor. I've been out to 
Spacetown. I've been down in 
Washington, talking to the Terrestrial Bureau of Investigation." 

"Oh? And what do the Terries 
have to say?" 

"They say it's our baby. Spacetown is under New York jurisdiction. " 

"But with extraterritorial 
rights." 

"I know. I'm coming to that." 
The Commissioner's eyes fell 



10 




 



away from Baley's flinty stare. 
He seemed to regard himself as 
having been suddenly demoted to 
the position of Baley's underling, 
and Baley behaved as though he 
accepted the fact. 

"The Spacers can run the 
show," said Baley. 

"Wait a minute, Lije," pleaded 
the Commissioner. "Don't rush 
me. I'm trying to talk this over, 
friend to friend. I want you to 
know my position. I was there 
when the news broke. I had an 
appointment with him — with Roj 
Nemennuh Sarton." 

"The victim?" 

"That's right.'* The Commissioner groaned. "Five minutes 
more and I myself would have 
discovered the body. What a 
shock that would have been! As 
it was, it was brutal. Brutal! 
They met me and told me. It 
started a three-day nightmare, 
Lije. That on top of having everything blur on me and having no 
time to replace my glasses for 
days. That won't happen again, 
at least. I've ordered three pairs." 

T IJE Baley considered the picture he conjured up of the 
event. He could see the tall, fair 
Spacers approaching the Commissioner with the news and 
breaking it to him in their unvarnished emotionless way. Julius 
would remove his glasses and 
polish them. Inevitably, under 



the impact of the event, he would 
drop them, then look down at the 
broken remnants with a quiver of 
his soft, full lips. Baley was quite 
certain that for five minutes, anyway, the Commissioner was much 
more disturbed over his glasses 
than over the murder. 

The Commissioner was saying, 
"It's a devil of a position. As you 
say, the Spacers have extraterritorial rights. They can insist on 
their own investigation, make 
whatever report they wish to their 
home governments. The Outer 
Worlds could use this as an excuse to pile on indemnity charges. 
You know how that would be 
taken by Earth." 

"It would be political suicide 
if the President agreed to pay." 

"And another kind of suicide 
not to." 

"You don't have to draw me a 
diagram," said Baley. He had 
been a small boy when the gleaming cruisers from outer space sent 
down their soldiers into Washington, New York, Moscow, 
Paris, London and Canton to collect what they claimed was theirs. 

"Then you see," the Commissioner said. "Pay or not pay, it 
means trouble. The only way out 
is to find the murderer and hand 
him over to the Spacers. It's 
up to us." 

"Why not give it to the T.B.I. 
even if it is legally within our 
jurisdiction? There's the question 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



11 



of interstellar relations-—" 

"The T.B.I, won't touch it. 
This is hot and it's in our lap." 
For a moment, he lifted his head 
and peered keenly at his subordinate. "And it's not good, Lije. 
Every one of us stands the chance 
of being out of a job." 

"Replace all of us?" Baley demanded. "Yeast ! The trained 
men to do it with don't exist." 

"Robots," said the Commissioner. "They exist." 

"What?" 

"R. Sammy is just a beginning. 
He runs errands. Other robots can 
patrol the Expressways, control 
traffic — I hear it's been tried in 
other cities experimentally and it 
seems to work. There are robots 
that can do your work. Yes, and 
mine. Don't think we can't be declassified. And at our age, to 
wind up in the labor pool — " 

Baley said gruffly, "All right!" 

The Commissioner looked 
abashed. "Sorry, Lije." 

Baley nodded and tried not to 
think of his father. The Commissioner knew the facts from his 
Service file, of course. 

"You evidently think all this 
replacement business is threatening you - and me," Baley said. 
"There's a limit to how far it 
can go." 

"T OOK, you're being naive, 
•^Lije. It's been getting worse 
and worse ever since the Spacers 



came, twenty-five years ago. It's 
just beginning to reach higher, 
that's all. If we muff this case, 
it's a big, long step toward the 
point where we can stop looking 
forward to collecting our pensiontab booklets. On the other hand, 
Lije, if we handle the matter well, 
it can push the danger far into 
the future. And it would be a particular break for you." 

"For me?" asked Baley. 

"You'll be the operative in 
charge, Lije." 

"I don't rate it, Commissioner. 
I'm only a C-5." 

"You want a C-6 rating, don't 
you?" 

Did he? Baley knew the privileges of a C-6. A seat on the Expressway in the rush hour, not 
just from ten to four. Higher up 
on the list-of-choice at the Section Kitchens. Maybe even a 
chance at a better apartment and 
a quota ticket to the Solarium 
levels for Jessie. 

"I want it," he said. "Sure. But 
what would I get if I couldn't 
break the case?" 

"Why wouldn't you break it, 
Lije?" wheedled the Commissioner. "You're a good man." 

"But there are half a dozen 
men with higher ratings in* my 
Department Section. Why should 
they be passed over?" 

The Commissioner folded his 
hands. "Two reasons. You're not 
just another detective to me, Lije. 



13 




 



We're friends, too. I'm not forgetting we were in college together. Sometimes it may look as 
though I have forgotten, but 
that's the fault of rating. I'm 
Commissioner and you know 
what that means. But I'm still 
your friend and this is a tremendous chance for the right person. 
I want you to have it." 

"That's one reason," said 
Baley, without warmth. 

"The second reason is that I 
need a favor." 

"What sort of favor?" 

"The Spacers agreed not to report the murder and to leave the 
investigation in our hands. In 
return, they insist that one of 
their own agents be in on the deal 
— the whole deal." 

"It sounds like they don't trust 
us altogether." 

"Surely you see their point. If 
this is mishandled, a number of 
them will be in trouble with their 
own governments. I'll give them 
the benefit of the doubt, Lije. 
I'm willing to believe they mean 
well." 

"I'm sure they do, Commissioner. That's the trouble with 
them." 

rpHE Commissioner looked 
blank at that, but went on, 
"Are you willing to take on a 
Spacer partner, Lije?" 

"You're asking that as a 
favor?" 



"Yes, I'm asking you to take 
the job with all the conditions 
the Spacers have set up." 

"I'll take a Spacer partner, 
Commissioner." 

"Thanks, Lije, He'll have to 
live with you." 

"Oh, now, hold on I" 

"I know, I know. But you've 
got a large apartment, Lije. Three 
rooms. Only one child. He'll be 
no trouble at all. And it's necessary." 

"Jessie won't like it." 

"You tell Jessie — " the Commissioner was so earnest that his 
eyes seemed to bore holes through 
the glass discs blocking his stare 
— "that if you do this for me, 
I'll do what I can to jump you a 
grade. C-7, Lije. C-7!" 

"All right, Commissioner, it's 
a deal." 

Baley half-rose from his chair, 
caught the look on Enderby's 
face and sat down again. 

"There's something else?" 

Slowly, the Commissioner 
nodded. "One more item." 

"Which is?" 

"The name of your partner." 
"What difference does that 
make?" 

"The Spacers," said the Commissioner, "have peculiar ways. 
The partner they're supplying 
isn't — isn't — " 

Baley's eyes opened wide. "Just 
a minute!" 

"You've got to, Lije. You've 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



got to. There's no way out." 

"Stay at my apartment? A 
thing like that?" 

"Lije, I can't trust anyone else 
in this. Do I have to spell it 
out for you? We've got to work 
with the Spacers. We've got to 
succeed, if we're to keep the indemnity ships away from Earth. 
But we can't succeed just any 
old way. You'll be partnered with 
one of their Rs. If ftfi breaks the 
case, if he can report that we're 
incompetent, we're ruined, anyway. We as a Department. You 
see that, don't you? So you've 
got a delicate job on your hands. 
You have to work with him, yet 
see to it that you solve the case 
and not he. Understand?" 

"You mean cooperate with him 
one hundred per cent except that 
I cut his throat? Pat him on 
the back with a knife in my 
hand?" 

"What else can we do? There's 
no other way out." 

Lije Baley stood irresolute. "I 
don't know what Jessie will say." 

"I'll talk to her, if you want 
me to." 

"No, Commissioner." He drew 
a deep, sighing breflth. "What's 
my partner's name?'' 

"R. Daneel Olivatf." 

Baley said. "This isn't a time 
for euphemism. Commissioner. 
I'm taking the job, so let's use 
his full name. Robot Daneel 
Olivaw." 



CHAPTER II 

THERE was the usual crowd 
on the Expressway ; the 
standees on the lower level and 
those with seat-privileges above. 
A continuous trickle of humanity 
filtered off the Expressway, across 
the decelerating strips to localways or into the Stationaries that 
led under arches or over bridges 
into the endless mazes of the City 
Sections. Another trickle, just as 
continuous, worked inward from 
the other side, across the accelerating strips and onto the Expressway. 

There were the infinite lights, 
the luminous walls and ceilings 
that seemed to drip cool, even 
phosphorescence; the flashing advertisements screaming for attention; the harsh, steady gleam 
of the "lightworms" that directed 

THIS WAY TO JERSEY SECTIONS. 
FOLLOW ARROWS TO EAST RIVER 
SHUTTLE. UPPER LEVEL FOR ALL 
WAYS TO LONG ISLAND SECTIONS. 

Most of all, there was the 
noise that was inseparable from 
life. The sound of millions talking, laughing, coughing, calling, 
humming, breathing. 

He stepped from strip to strip 
with the ease of a lifetime's practice. Children learned to "hop the 
strips" as soon as they learned 
to walk. Baley scarcely felt the 
jerk of acceleration as his velocity 
increased with each step. He was 



14 




 



not even aware that he leaned 
forward against the force. In 
thirty seconds, he had reached the 
final sixty-mile-an-hour strip and 
could step aboard the railed and 
glassed-in moving platform that 
was the Expressway. 

No directions to Spacetown, 
he thought. 

No need for directions. If you 
had business there, you knew the 
way. If you didn't know the way, 
you had no business there. When 
Spacetown was first established 
some twenty-five years earlier, 
there had been a strong tendency 
to make a showplace out of it. 
The hordes of the City herded in 
that direction. 

The Spacers put a stop to that. 
Politely — they were always polite — but without any compromise with tact, they put up a 
force barrier between themselves 
and the City. They established a 
combination Immigration Service and Customs Inspection. 

It gave rise to dissatisfaction, 
naturally. More dissatisfaction 
than it deserved. Baley remembered the Barrier Riots. He had 
been part of the mob that had 
suspended itself from the rails 
of the Expressways, crowded onto 
the seats in disregard of rating 
privileges, run recklessly along 
and across the strips at the risk 
of a broken body, and remained 
just outside the Spacetown Barrier for two days, shouting slogans 



and destroying City property out 
of sheer frustration. 

Baley could still sing the chants 
of the time if he put his mind 
to it. There was "Man was born 
on Mother Earth, do you hear?" 
to an old folk-tune called "Hinkydinky-parley-voo." 

Man was born an Mother Earth, 

do you hear? 
Earth's the world that gave him 

birth, do you hear? 
Spacer, get you off the face 
Of Mother Earth and into space. 
Dirty Spacer, do you hear?" 

fTIHERE were hundreds of 
verses. A few were witty, most 
were stupid, many were obscene. 
Every one, however, ended with 
"Dirty Spacer, do you hear?" 
Dirty, dirty. It was the futile 
throwing back at the Spacers 
their most keenly felt insult — 
their insistence on considering the 
natives of Earth as disgustingly 
diseased. 

The Spacers didn't leave, of 
course. Earth's outmoded fleet 
had long since learned that it was 
suicide to challenge any Outer 
World ship. Earth planes had 
angrily ventured over Spacetown 
in the very early days of its 
establishment and simply disappeared. Only a shredded wingtip or two had tumbled down 
to the ground. 

And no mob could be so mad


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



15 



dened as to forget the effect of 
the partable sub-etheric disrupters used on Earthmen in those 
days. 

So the Spacers sat behind their 
Barrier, which itself was the product of their own advanced science, and which no method 
known on Earth could duplicate 
or break. They just waited stolidly on the other side of the Barrier until the City quieted the 
mob with somno-vapor and retchgas. The below-level penitentiaries rattled afterward with 
ringleaders, malcontents, and 
people who had been picked up 
only because they were nearest 
at hand. They were all set free 
before long. 

After a proper interval, the 
Spacers eased their restrictions. 
The Barrier was removed and the 
City Police entrusted with maintaining Spacetown's arrogant, 
threatening isolation. 

Now, thought Baley, things 
might take a reverse trend. If the 
Spacers seriously thought that 
an Earthman had entered Spacetown and committed murder, the 
Barrier might go up again. It 
would be bad, he thought, knowing just how grotesque an understatement that was. 

He lifted himself onto the Expressway platform, made his way 
through the standees to the tight 
spiral ramp that led to the upper 
level, and sat down. He didn't 



put his rating ticket in his hatband till they passed the last of 
the Hudson sections. A C-5 had 
no seat rights east of the Hudson 
and west of Long Island, and although there was ample seating 
available, one of the Way guards 
would have automatically ousted 
him. People were increasingly 
petty about rating privileges and, 
in all honesty, Baley lumped 
himself in with "people." 

ri~VHE air made the characteristic whistling norse as it frictioned off the curved windshields 
set above the back of every seat. 
It made talking a chore, but was 
no bar to thinking when you were 
used to it. 

Baley's thinking was interrupted by a female shriek. A woman 
had dropped her handbag ; he 
saw it for an instant, a pastel 
pink blob against the dull gray of 
the strips. A corner of Baley's 
mouth quirked. She might catch 
up with it, if she were clever 
enough and if passengers did not 
accidentally kick it this way and 
that. He would never know 
whether she did or not. The scene 
was already half a mile to the 
rear. 

Chances were she wouldn't. He 
knew the statistics — an article 
was dropped on the strips somewhere in the City every three 
minutes and only one out of 
seventeen was recovered. The 



16 




 



Lost and Found Department was 
among the biggest bureaus in the 
City. It was just one more complication of modern life. 

It was simpler once, Baley 
thought. That was what made 
Medievalists. Most Earthmen 
were Medievalists in one way or 
another. It was an easy thing 
to be when it meant looking back 
to a time when Earth was the 
world and not just one of fifty. 
The misfit one of fifty at that. 

Medievalism took different 
forms. To the unimaginative 
Julius Enderby, it meant the 
adoption of anachronisms — spectacles, windows. 

To Baley, it was the study of 
history, particularly the history 
of folkways. 

The City now — New York 
City, in which he lived and had 
his being. Larger than any City 
but Los Angeles. More populous 
than any but Shanghai. It was 
only three centuries old. 

To be sure, something had existed in the same geographic area 
before then that had been called 
New York City. That primitive 
gathering of population had existed for three thousand years, 
not three hundred, but it hadn't 
been a City. 

There were no Cities then, just 
huddles of dwellings large and 
small, open to the air. They were 
something like the Space Domes, 
only much different, of course. 



These huddles — the largest barely 
reached ten million in population 
and most were under a million — 
were scattered all over Earth by 
the thousands. By modern standards, they had been completely 
inefficient economically. 

"CiFFICIENCY had been forced 
on Earth with increasing population. Two billion people, three 
billion, even five billion could be 
supported by the planet by progressive lowering of the standard 
of living. When the population 
reaches eight billion, however, 
semi-starvation becomes the 
norm. A radical change had to 
take place in Man's culture, particularly when it turned out that 
the Outer Worlds (which had 
merely been Earth's colonies a 
thousand years before) were 
serious about their immigration 
restrictions. 

The radical change had been 
the gradual formation of the 
Cities over a thousand years of 
Earth's history. Efficiency implied bigness. Even in Medieval 
times, that had been realized, 
perhaps unconsciously. Home industry gave way to factories, and 
factories to continental industries. 

Think of the inefficiency of a 
hundred thousand houses for a 
hundred thousand families as 
compared with a hundred-thousand-unit Section; a book-film 
collection in each house, as com


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



pared with a Section film-concentrate ; independent video for 
each family as compared with 
video-piping systems. 

For that matter, take the simple folly of endless duplication 
of kitchens and bathrooms as 
compared with the thoroughly 
efficient diners and shower rooms 
made possible by City culture. 

More and more, the villages, 
towns and "cities" of Earth died 
and were swallowed by the Cities. 
Even the early prospects of 
atomic war only slowed the trend. 

City culture meant optimum 
distribution of food, increasing 
utilization of yeasts and hydroponics. New York City spread 
over two thousand square miles 
and at the last census, its population was well over twenty 
million. There were some eight 
hundred cities on Earth with an 
average population of ten million. 

Each City became a semi-autonomous unit, economically all 
but self-sufficient. It could roof 
itself in, gird itself about, burrow 
itself under. It became a cave, a 
tremendous, self-contained cave 
of steel and concrete. 

It could lay itself out scientifically. .At the center was the 
enormous complex of administrative offices. In careful orientation to one another and to the 
whole were the large residential 
Sections connected and interlaced 
by the Expressway and the Local


ways. Toward the outskirts were 
the factories, the hydroponic 
plants, the yeast-culture vats, the 
power plants. Through all this 
ran the water-pipes and sewageducts, schools, prisons and shops, 
power lines and communicationbeams. 

No doubt about it, the City 
was the culmination of Man's 
mastery over the environment. 
Not space-travel, not the fifty 
colonized worlds that were now 
so haughtily independent, but 
the City. 

T>R ACTI CA LLY none of 
Earth's population lived outside the Cities. Outside was the 
wilderness, the open sky that few 
men could face with anything like 
equanimity. To be sure, the open 
space was necessary. It held the 
water that men must have, 
the coal and the wood that 
were the ultimate raw materials 
for plastics and for the eternally 
growing yeast. (Petroleum had 
long vanished, but oil-rich strains 
of yeast were an adequate substitute.) The land between the Cities 
still held the mines, and was still 
used to a larger extent than most 
men realized for growing food 
and grazing stock. It was inefficient, but beef, pork and grain 
always found a luxury market 
and could be used for export 
purposes. 

But few humans were required 



18 




 



to run the mines and ranches, to 
exploit the farms and pipe the 
water, and these supervised at 
long distance. Robots did the 
work better and required less. 

Robots. That was the one huge 
irony. It was on Earth that the 
posit ronic brain had been invented and on Earth that robots 
had first been put to productive 
use. Not on the Outer Worlds, 
though the Outer Worlds always 
acted as if robots had been born 
of their culture. 

In a way, of course, the culmination of robot economy had 
taken place on the Outer Worlds. 
Here on Earth, robots had always 
been restricted to the mines and 
farmlands. Only in the last quarter-century, under the urgings of 
the Spacers, had robots filtered 
their slow way into the Cities. 

The Cities were good. Everyone but the Medievalists knew 
that they had no reasonable substitute. The only trouble was that 
they wouldn't stay good. Earth's 
population was still rising. Some 
day, with all that the Cities 
could do, the available calories 
per person would simply fall below basic subsistence level. 

It was all the worse because of 
the existence of the Spacers, the 
descendants of the early emigrants from Earth, living in luxury on their underpopulated robot-ridden worlds out in space. 
They were coolly determined to 



keep the comfort that grew out of 
the emptiness of their worlds, and 
for that purpose they kept their 
birth-rate down and immigrants 
from teeming Earth out. And 
this — 

A nudge at Baley's unconscious 
warned him that he was approaching the Newark Section. 
If he stayed where he was much 
longer, he'd find himself speeding 
southwestward to the Trenton 
Section turning of the Way, 
through the heart of the warm 
and musty-odored yeast country. 

It was a matter of timing — 
so long to shinny down the steps, 
so long to squirm through the 
grunting standees, so long to slip 
along the railing and out an 
opening, so long to hop across 
the decelerating strips. 

When he was done, he was 
precisely at the off -shooting of 
the proper Stationary. At no time 
did he time his steps consciously. 
If he had, he would probably 
have missed. 

T>ALEY found himself in unusual semi-isolation. Only a 
policeman was with him inside 
the Stationary and, except for the 
unnoticed whirring of the Expressway, there was an almost 
uncomfortable silence. 

The policeman approached, 
and Baley flashed his badge impatiently. The policeman lifted 
his hand in permission to pass on. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



19 



The passage narrowed and 
curved sharply three or four 
times. That was obviously deliberate. Mobs of Earthmen 
couldn't gather in it and direct 
charges were impossible. 

A Spacer was standing at the 
point where a series of doors 
marked the openings to the open 
air and the domes of Spacetown. 
He was dressed in Earth fashion, 
trousers tight at the waist, loose 
at the ankle and color-striped 
down the seam of each leg. He 
wore an ordinary Textron shirt, 
open collar, seam-zipped and 
ruffled at the wrist, but the way 
he stood, the way he held his 
head, the calm and unemotional 
lines of his broad, high-cheekboned face, the careful set of his 
short, bronze hair lying flatly 
backward and without a part 
marked him as a Spacer. 

Baley approached and said in 
a monotone, "I am Plainclothesman Elijah Baley, Police Department, City of New York, Rating 
C-5." He showed his credentials. 
"I have been instructed to meet 
R. Daneel Olivaw at Spacetown 
Approachway." He looked at his 
watch. "I am a little early. May 
• I request, the announcement of 
my presence?" 

The Spacer, who had listened 
politely, said, "It will not be necessary. I have been waiting for 
you." 

Baley's hand went up auto


matically, then dropped. So did 
his long chin. He didn't quite 
manage to say anything. The 
words froze. 

The Spacer said, "I shall introduce myself. I am R. Daneel 
Olivaw." 

"Yes? Am I making a mistake? 
I thought the first initial — " 

"Quite so. I am a robot." 

T>UTTING a damp hand to his 
hair, Baley smoothed it back 
unnecessarily. Then he held the 
hand out. "I'm sorry, Mr. Olivaw. 
I don't know what I was thinking 
of. I am Elijah Baley, your partner." 

The robot's hand closed on his 
with a smoothly increasing pressure that reached a comfortably 
friendly peak, then declined. "I 
seem to detect disturbance. May 
I ask that you be frank with 
me? It is best to have as many 
relevant facts as possible in a relationship such as ours. And it is 
customary on my world for partners to call one another by the 
familiar name. I trust that that 
is not counter to your own customs." 

"It's just that you don't look 
like a robot," said Baley desperately. 

"And that disturbs you?" 

"It shouldn't, I suppose, Da — 
Daneel. Are they all like you on 
your world?" 

"There are individual differ 


20 




 



ences, Elijah, as with men." 

"Our own robots — Well, you 
can tell they're robots. You look 
like a Spacer." 

"Oh, I see. You expected a 
rather crude model and were surprised. Yet it is only logical that 
our people should use a robot 
of pronounced humanoid characteristics in this case if we expected to avoid unpleasantness. 
Is that not so?" 

It was certainly so. An undisguised robot roaming the City 
would be in quick trouble. 

Baley said, "Yes." 

"Then let us leave now, Elijah." 

They made their way back to 
the Expressway. Robot Daneel 
caught the purpose of the accelerating strips and maneuvered 
along them with a quick proficiency. Baley, who had begun 
by moderating his speed, ended 
by hastening it in annoyance. He 
reached the endless cars of Expressway and scrambled aboard 
with what amounted to outright 
recklessness. The robot followed 
easily. 

Baley was red. He swallowed 
twice and said, "I'll stay down 
here with you." 

"Down here?" The robot, apparently oblivious to both the 
noise and the rhythmic swaying 
of the platform, said, "Is my information wrong? I was told that 
a rating of C-5 entitled one to a 



seat on the upper level under 
certain conditions." 

"You're right. I can go up 
there, but you won't know where 
to get off if I'm not with you." 

"Why can I not go up with 
you?" 

"It takes a C-5, Daneel." 

Talking was difficult. The hiss 
of frictioning air was louder on 
the less-shielded lower level and 
Baley was understandably anxious to keep his voice low. 

R. Daneel said. "Why should 
I not be a C-5? I am your partner and, consequently, of equal 
rank. I was given this." 

From an inner shirt pocket he 
produced a rectangular credential card, quite genuine. The 
name given was Daneel Olivaw, 
without the all-important initial. 
The rating was C-5. 

"Come on up," said Baley 
woodenly. 

Seated. Baley looked straight 
ahead, angry with himself, very 
conscious of the robot sitting 
next to him. He had been caught 
twice. He had not recognized R. 
Daneel as a robot; he had not 
guessed the logic that demanded 
R. Daneel be given C-5 rating. 

The trouble was, of course, that 
he was not the plainclothesman 
of popular myth. He was not incapable of surprise, imperturbable of appearance, infinite of 
adaptability, and lightning of 
mental grasp. He had never sup


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



posed he was, but he had never 
regretted the lack before. 

What made him regret it was 
that, to all appearances, R. 
Daneel Olivaw was that very 
myth embodied. 

He had to be. He was a robot. 

Baley began to find excuses for 
himself. He was accustomed to 
the robots like R. Sammy at the 
ofHce. He had expected a creature 
with a skin of hard and glossy 
plastic, nearly dead white in 
color. He had expected an expression fixed at an unreal level 
of inane good humor. He had 
expected jerky, faintly uncertain 
motions. 

R. Daneel was none of that. 

Baley risked a quick sideglance at the robot. R. Daneel 
turned simultaneously to meet 
his eye and nod gravely. His lips 
had moved naturally when he 
had spoken and did not simply 
remain parted as those of Earth 
robots did. There had been 
glimpses of an articulating 
tongue. 

Baley thought: Why does he 
have to sit there so calmly? This 
must be something completely 
new to him — noise, lights, crowds. 

Baley got up, brushed past R. 
Daneel and said, "Follow me." 

Off the Expressway, down the 
decelerating strips. 

Baley thought: Good Lord, 
what do I tell Jessie, anyway? 

The coming of the robot had 



rattled that thought out of his 
head, but it was coming back 
with sickening urgency, now that 
they were heading down the 
Localway that led into the Lower 
Bronx Section. 

He said, "This is all one building, you know. Daneel; everything you see, the whole City. 
Twenty million people live in it. 
The Expressways go continuously, night and day, at sixty miles 
an hour. There are nine hundred 
and fifty miles of it altogether 
and thousands of miles of Localways." 

Any minute now, Baley 
thought, I'll be figuring out how 
many tons of yeast -product New 
York eats per day and how many 
cubic feet of water we drink and 
how many megawatts of power 
the atomic piles deliver per hour. 

Daneel said, "I was informed 
of this and other similar data in 
my briefing." 

Baley thought: Well, that covers the food, drink, and power 
situation, too, I suppose. Why try 
to impress a robot? 

THEY were at East 182nd 
Street and, in not more than 
two hundred yards, they would 
be at the elevator banks that fed 
.those steel and concrete layers of 
apartments that included his own. 

He was on the point of saying, 
"This way," when he was stopped 
by a knot of people gathering 



22 




 



outside the brilliantly lighted 
force-door of one of the many 
retail departments that lined the 
ground levels solidly in this Section. 

He asked of the nearest in an 
automatic tone of authority, 
"What's going on?" 

The man he addressed, who 
was standing on tiptoe, said, 
"Damned if I know. I just got 
here." 

Someone else said excitedly, 
"They got those lousy Rs in there. 
I think maybe they'll throw them 
out here. Boy, I'd like to take 
them apart." 

Baley looked nervously at 
Daneel, but if the latter caught 
the significance of the words or 
even heard them, he did not show 
it. 

Baley plunged into the crowd. 
"Let me through. Police!" 

They made way. Baley caught 
words behind him. 

u — take them apart nut by nut, 
split them down the seams slowlike — " And someone else laughed. 

Baley turned a little cold. The 
City was the acme of efficiency, 
but it made demands of its inhabitants. It asked them to live 
in a tight routine and order 
their lives under a strict and 
scientific control. Occasionally, 
built-up inhibitions exploded. 

He remembered the Barrier 
riots. 



Reasons for anti -robot rioting 
certainly existed. Men who found 
themselves faced with the prospect of declassification, after half 
a lifetime of effort, could not decide cold-bloodedly that individual robots were not to blame. 
Individual robots could at least 
be struck at. 

One could not strike at something called "governmental policy" or at a slogan like "Higher 
production with robot labor." 

The government called it growing pains. It shook its collective 
head sorrowfully and assured 
everyone that, after a necessary 
period of adjustment, a new and 
better life would exist for all. 

But the Medievalist movement 
expanded along with the declassification process. Men grew frightened and the border between 
bitter frustration and wild destruction is sometimes easily 
crossed. 

At this moment, minutes could 
be separating the hostility of the 
crowd from a flashing orgy of 
blood and smash. 

Baley writhed his way desperately to the force-door. 

CHAPTER III 

THE interior of the store was 
emptier than the street outside. The manager, with commendable foresight had thrown 
the force-door early in the game, 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



23 



preventing potential troublemakers from entering. It also kept the 
principals in the argument from 
leaving, but that was minor. 

Baley got through the forcedoor by using his official neutralizer. Unexpectedly, he found 
R. Daneel still behind him. The 
robot was pocketing a neutralizer 
of his own — a slim one, smaller 
and neater than the standard 
police model. 

The manager ran to them instantly, talking loudly. "Officers, 
my clerks have been assigned me 
by the City. I am perfectly within 
my rights." 

There were three robots standing rodlike at the rear of the 
department. Six humans were 
standing near the force-door. 
They were all women. 

"All right now," said Baley 
crisply. "What's going on? What's 
all the fuss about?" 

One of the women said shrilly, 
"I came in for shoes. Why can't 
I have a human clerk? Ain't I 
respectable?" 

The manager said, "111 wait 
on her myself if I have to, but 
I can't wait on all of them, 
Officer. There's nothing wrong 
with my men. They're registered 
clerks. I have their spec charts 
and guarantee slips — " 

"Spec charts!" screamed the 
woman, turning to the rest. "He 
calls them men! They ain't men. 
They're ro—bots!" She stretched 



out the syllables. "And I tell you 
what they do, in case you don't 
know. They steal jobs from men." 

A voice sounded from the other 
side of the force-door, queerly 
deadened and distorted by the 
effects of the barrier of inertia, 
but with anger still clearly audible. "My job! My job they 
took!" 

A figure shoved furiously 
through the crowd. The face was 
pale in the corridor lights; arms 
waved wildly. "I was ten years 
on that job. Now my kids ain't 
got enough to eat. Why? Why? 
I should've been born a robot. 
The Government takes care of 
them all right!" 

The crowd roared. 

T> ALEY was brutally conscious 
of R. Daneel Olivaw standing at his elbow. He looked at 
the clerks. They were Earthmade, and even on that scale, 
relatively inexpensive models. 

They were just robots made 
to know such simple things as 
all the style numbers, their prices, 
the sizes available in each. They 
could keep track uf inventory 
better than humans could since 
they would have no outside interests. They could compute the 
proper orders for the next week. 
They could measure the customer's foot. 

In themselves, harmless. As a 
group, incredibly dangerous. 



24 




 



Baley could sympathize with 
the woman more deeply than he 
would have believed possible two 
hours before. Wondering if R. 
Daneel could not replace an ordinary Plainclothesman C-5, he 
could see the barracks, could 
taste the yeast -mush, and he 
could remember his father. 

His father had been a nuclear 
physicist, with a rating that had 
put him in the top percentile of 
the City. There had been an accident at the power plant and his 
father had borne the blame. He 
had been declassified. Baley did 
not know the details; it had happened when he was a year old. 

But he remembered the barracks of his childhood, the grinding communal existence just this 
side of the edge of bearability. He 
remembered his mother not at all; 
she had not survived long. His 
father he recalled well, a sodden 
man, morose and lost, speaking 
sometimes of the past in a hoarse, 
broken whisper. 

His father died, still declassified, when Baley was eight. 
Young Baley and his two older 
sisters moved into the Section 
orphanage. Children's Level, they 
called it. His mother's brother, 
whom Baley thought of always 
as "Uncle Boris," was himself too 
poor to prevent that. 

So it continued hard. And it 
was hard going through school, 
with no father-derived status


privileges to smooth the way. 

And now he had to stand in the 
middle of a growing riot and 
pacify or intimidate men and women who, after all, only feared 
declassification for themselves 
and those they loved, as he himself did. 

rpONELESSLY, he said to the 
woman who had spoken, 
"Let's not have any trouble, lady. 
The clerks aren't doing you any 
harm." 

"Sure they ain't done me no 
harm," snapped the woman. 
"They ain't gonna, either. Think 
IH let their cold, greasy fingers 
touch me? I came in here expecting to get treated like a human being. I got a right to have 
human beings wait on me. And, 
listen, I got two kids waiting for 
supper. They can't go to the Section Kitchen without me like they 
were orphans. I gotta get out of 
here." 

"If you had let yourself be 
waited on, you'd have been out 
of here by now. You're just making trouble for nothing." 

"Well!" The woman registered 
shock. "Maybe you think you 
can talk to me like I was dirt. 
Maybe it's time the Government 
realized robots ain't the only 
things on Earth. I'm a hardworking woman and I've got 
rights." 

Baley could feel the situation 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



25 



get out of hand. Even if the 
woman would consent to be waited on, the waiting crowd was 
ugly enough for anything. There 
must be a hundred crammed 
outside the display window now. 

"What is the usual procedure 
in such a case?" asked R. Daneel 
Olivaw suddenly. 

Baley nearly jumped. He said, 
"This is an unusual case in the 
first place." 

"What is the law?" 

"The Rs have been duly assigned here. They're registered 
clerks. There's nothing illegal 
about that." 

"In that case," said R. Daneel, 
"order the woman to let herself 
be waited on or to leave." 

"It's a mob we have to deal 
with, not a woman. There's nothing to do but call a riot squad." 

"It should not be necessary for 
citizens to require more than one 
officer of the law to direct what 
should be done." said Daneel. He 
turned his broad face to the store 
manager. "Open the force-door, 
sir." 

Baley's arm shot forward to 
seize R. Daneel's shoulder, swing 
him about. He arrested the motion. If, at* this moment, two lawmen quarreled openly, it would 
mean the end of all chance for a 
peaceful solution. 

The manager protested, looked 
at Baley. Baley did not meet his 
eye. 




26 




 



R. Daneel said, unmoved, "I 
order you with the authority of 
the Law." 

The manager bleated, "I'll hold 
the City responsible for any damage to the goods or fixtures. I 
serve notice that I'm doing this 
under orders." 

'T^HE barrier went down; men 
and women crowded in. There 
was a happy roar to them. They 
sensed victory. 

Baley had seen robots being 
lifted by a dozen hands, their 
heavy unresisting bodies carried 
backward from straining arm to 
straining arm. Men yanked and 
twisted at the metal mimicry of 
men. They used hammers, forceknives, needle-guns, and finally 
reduced the miserable objects to 
shredded metal and wire. Expensive positronic brains, the most 
intricate creation of the human 
mind, were thrown from hand to 
hand like footballs and mashed 
to uselessness in a trifle of time. 

Then, with, the genius of destruction so merrily let loose, the 
mobs turned on anything else that 
could be taken apart. 

The robot clerks could have no 
knowledge of any of this, so they 
stood smilingly ready to sell shoes 
as the crowd flooded inward. The 
woman who had started the fuss, 
frightened at seeing it grow so 
suddenly, gasped, "Here, now. 
Here, now." 



The manager was shrieking, 
"Stop them, Officer! Stop them!" 

R. Daneel spoke. Without apparent effort, his voice was suddenly decibels higher than a 
human's voice had a right to be. 
Of course, thought Baley for the 
tenth time, he's not — 

R. Daneel said, "The next man 
who moves will be shot." 

Someone well in the back yelled, "Get him!" 

But for a moment, no one 
moved. 

R. Daneel stepped nimbly upon 
a chair and from that to the 
top of a Transtex display case. 
The colored fluorescence gleaming through the slits of polarized 
molecular film turned his cool, 
smooth face into something unearthly. 

Unearthly, thought Baley. 

R. Daneel said crisply, "You 
are saying, 'This man is holding 
a neuronic whip, or a tickler. If 
we all rush forward, we will bear 
him down and at most one or two 
of us will be hurt and even they 
will recover. Meanwhile, we will 
do just as we wish and to space 
with law and order.' " His voice 
was neither harsh nor angry, but 
it carried authority. "You are 
mistaken. What I hold is not a 
neuronic whip, nor is it a tickler. 
It is a blaster and very deadly. I 
will kill many of you before you 
seize me — perhaps most of you." 

There was motion at the out


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



27 



skirts, but the crowd no longer 
grew. Those nearest R. Daneel 
were holding their breath, trying 
desperately to resist the mass 
pressure of those behind them. 

The woman with the hat broke 
the spell. "He's gonna kill ust I 
ain't done nothing! Oh, lemme 
outta here!" 

She turned, but faced an immovable wall of crammed men 
and women. 

R DANEEL jumped down 
• from the display counter 
and said, "I will now walk to the 
door. I will shoot the man or 
woman who touches me. When I 
» reach the door, I will shoot any 
man or woman who is not moving 
about his business. This woman 
here — " 

"No, no!" yelled the woman 
with the hat. "I tell you I didn't 
do anything. I didn't mean any 
harm. I don't want any shoes. I 
just want to go home." 

"This woman here," went on 
Daneel, "will remain. She will be 
waited on." 

He stepped forward. 

The mob faced him dumbly. 
Baley closed his eyes. It wasn't 
'his fault, he thought desperately. 
There'll be murder done and the 
worst mess in the world, but 
they forced a robot on me as 
partner. They gave him equal 
status. 

He didn't believe the excuse 



himself. He might have stopped 
R. Daneel at the start. He might 
have put in the call for a squadcar. He had let R. Daneel take 
responsibility, instead, and had 
felt a cowardly relief at it. When 
he tried to tell himself that R. 
Daneel's personality simply dominated the situation, he was filled 
with a sudden self-loathing. A 
robot dominating a situation! 

He was aware of no unusual 
noise, no shouting and cursing, 
no groans, no yells. His eyes 
sprang open. 

Jehoshaphat, they were dispersing! 

The manager of the store was 
cooling down, adjusting his 
twisted jacket, smoothing his 
hair, muttering angry threats at 
the vanishing crowd. One of the 
robot clerks advanced on the 
cowering woman with the hat and 
removed a shoe deftly. The robot's eye regarded it dispassionately for half a moment, then 
called out, "Size 6j^-C, last 14-X 
Alcove D-second shelf." A second clerk was already on the way 
to the indicated section. 

The smooth, fading whistle of 
a squad-car came to a halt just 
outside. Baley thought: Sure, 
when it's all over. 

The manager plucked his 
sleeve. "Let's have no more 
trouble, Officer." 

Baley said, "There won't be 
any trouble." 



28 




 



It was easy to get rid of the 
squad-car. They had come in response to reports of a crowd in 
the street. They knew no details 
and could only see for themselves 
that the street was clear. R. 
Daneel stepped aside and showed 
no sign of interest as Baley explained to the men in the squadcar, minimizing the event and 
completely burying R. Daneel's 
part in it. 

A FTER the car left he pulled 
**■ R. Daneel to one side, against 
the steel and concrete of one of 
the building shafts. 

"Listen," he said, "I'm not trying to steal your show, you understand." 

"Steal my show? Is that one 
of your Earth idioms?" 

"I didn't report your part in 
this." 

"I do not know all your customs. On my world, a complete 
report is usual, but perhaps it is 
not so on your world. In any 
case, civil rebellion was averted. 
That is the important thing, is 
it not?" 

"Is it? Now you look here." 
Baley tried to sound forceful. 
"Don't you ever do it again." 

"Never again insist on the observance of law? If I am not to 
do that, what then is my purpose?" 

"Don't ever threaten a human 
being with a blaster again." 



"I would not have fired under 
any circumstances, Elijah, as you 
know very well. I am incapable 
of hurting a human. But, as you 
see, I did not have to fire. I did 
not expect to have to." 

"That was pure luck, not having to fire. Don't take that kind 
of chance again. I could have 
pulled that grandstand stunt — " 

"Grandstand stunt? What is 
that?" 

"I could have pulled a blaster 
on the crowd myself. I had the 
blaster to do it with. But it 
isn't the kind of gamble I am 
justified in taking, or you, either. 
It was safer to call squad-cars to 
the scene than to try one-man 
heroics." 

R. Daneel considered. He shook 
his head. "I think you are wrong, 
partner Elijah. My briefing includes the information that, unlike the men of the Outer Worlds, 
Earthmen are trained from birth 
to accept authority. One man, 
representing authority firmly 
enough, was quite sufficient, as 
I proved. Your own desire for 
a squad-car was only an expression of your wish for superior 
authority to take responsibility 
out of your hands.- On my own 
world, I admit that what I did 
would have been most unjustified." 

Baley's long face was red with 
anger. "If they had recognized 
you as a robot — " 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



29 



"I was sure they wouldn't." 

"In any case, remember that 
you are a robot. Just a robot. 
Like those clerks in the shoe 
store." 

"But this is obvious." 

"And you're not human." Baley felt himself being driven into 
a wild cruelty almost against his 
will. 

"The division between human 
and robot is perhaps not as significant as that between intelligence and non-intelligence." 

"Maybe on your world, but not 
on Earth." Baley looked at his 
watch and shook his head angrily. 
He was an hour and a quarter 
late. He said curtly, "Let's go 
now. I've got to get you home." 

"You see, it is not proper to 
make any distinction of lesser 
meaning than the fact of intell — " 

Baley's voice rose. "All right! 
The subject is closed, Jessie is 
waiting for us." He walked in the 
direction of the nearest intrasection communi-tube. "I'd better call and tell her we're on our 
way up." 

"Jessie?" 

"My wife." 

Jehoshaphat, thought Baley, 
t I'm in a fine mood to face Jessie. 

CHAPTER IV 

TT had been her name that had 
first made Elijah Baley really 
conscious of Jessie. He had met 



her at the Section Christmas 
party back in '02, over a bowl 
of punch. He had just finished his 
schooling, just taken his first job 
with the City, just moved into one 
of the bachelor alcoves of Common Room 122A. 

She was handing out the punch. 
"I'm Jessie," she said. "Jessie 
Navodny. I don't know you." 

"Baley," he said, "Lije Baley. 
I'm new in the section." 

He took his punch and smiled 
mechanically. She impressed him 
as a cheerful and friendly person, 
so he stayed near her, watching 
the folks come and go, and sipping thoughtfully. 

"I helped make the punch." 
The girl's voice broke in upon 
him. "I can guarantee it. Do you 
want more?" 

Baley realized his glass was 
empty. He smiled and nodded. 

The girl's face was oval and 
not precisely pretty. Her dress 
was demure and conservative and 
she wore her light brown hair in 
a series of ringlets over her forehead. 

She joined him in the next 
drink and he felt better. 

"Jessie," he said, feeling the 
name with his tongue. "It's nice. 
Do you mind if I use it when, I'm 
talking to you." 

"If you want to. Do you know 
what it's short for?" 

"Jessica?" 

"You'll never guess." 



30 




 



"I can't think of anything 

else." 

She laughed and said archly, 
"My full name is Jezebel." 

That was when his interest 
flared. He put his punch glass 
down and said intently. "No, 
really?" 

"I'm not kidding. Jezebel. It's 
my real-for-true name on all my 
records. My parents liked the 
sound of it." 

She was quite proud of it, even 
though there was never a less 
likely Jezebel. 

Baley said seriously, "My name 
is Elijah, you know. My full 
name. I mean." 

It didn't register with her. 

He said, "Elijah was Jezebel's 
great enemy." 

"He was? 1 ' 

"Why, sure. In the Bible." 

"Oh? I didn't know that. Now 
isn't that funny? I hope that 
doesn't mean you'll have to be 
my enemy in real life." 

T^ROM the very beginning, 
there was no question of that. 
It was the coincidence of names 
at first that made her more than 
just a pleasant girl at the punchbowl. But afterward he had 
grown to find her cheerful, tender-hearted and finally, by some 
queer alchemy of the spirit, even 
pretty. He appreciated her cheerfulness particularly. His own sardonic view of life needed the 



antidote of cheerfulness. 

But Jessie never seemed to 
mind his long grave face. 

"Oh, goodness," she said, "what 
if you do look like a sour lemon? 
I know you're not really, and I 
guess if you were always grinning away like clockwork, the 
way I do, we'd just explode when 
we got together. You stay the 
way you are. Lije, and keep me 
from floating away." 

And she kept Lije Baley from 
sinking down. He applied for a 
small Couples apartment and got 
a contingent admission pending 
marriage. He showed it to her 
and said. "Will you fix it so I 
can get out of Bachelor's, Jessie? 
I don't like it there." 

Maybe it wasn't the most romantic proposal in the world, but 
Jessie said yes. 

Baley could only remember 
one time when Jessie's habitual 
cheer deserted her completely and 
that, too, had involved her name. 
It was in their first year of marriage — in fact the very month 
in which Bentley was conceived. 
(Their I.Q. rating. Genetic Values status, and Baley's position 
in the Department entitled him to 
two children, of which the first 
might be conceived during the 
first year.) Maybe, as Baley 
thought back upon it, that might 
have had something to do with it. 

Jessie had been drooping a bit 
because of Baley's consistent ov


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



31 



ertime hours of work. 

She said, "It's embarrassing to 
eat alone at the Kitchen every 
night." 

Baley was out of sorts. He said, 
"Why should it be? You can meet 
some nice single fellows there." 

And of course she promptly 
fired up. "You think I can't make 
an impression on them?" 

Maybe it was just because he 
was tired; maybe because Julius 
Enderby, a classmate of his, had 
moved up another notch on the 
C-scale rating while he himself 
had not. Maybe it was simply because he was a little tired of 
having her try to act up to the 
name she bore when she was 
nothing of the sort and never 
could be. 

In any case, he said bitingly, 
"I suppose you can, but I don't 
think you'll try. I wish you'd 
forget your name and be yourself." 

"I'll be just what I please." 

"Trying to be Jezebel won't 
get you anywhere. If you must 
know the truth, the name doesn't 
mean what you think, anyway. 
The Jezebel of the Bible was a 
faithful wife." 

JESSIE stared angrily at him. 
"That isn't so. I've heard the 
phrase, 'a painted Jezebel.' I 
know what that means." 

"Maybe you think you do, but 
you're wrong. After Jezebel's hus


band. King Ahab, died, her son 
Jehoram became king. One of 
the captains of his army, Jehu, 
rebelled against him and assassinated him. Jehu then rode to 
Jezreel where the old queenmother, Jezebel, was residing. 
Jezebel knew that he meant to 
kill her. In her pride and courage, she painted her face and 
dressed herself in her best clothes 
so that she could meet him as a 
haughty and defiant queen. He 
had her thrown from the window 
of the palace and killed, but she 
made a good end according to my 
notions. And that's what people 
refer to when they speak of a 
'painted Jezebel,' whether they 
know it or not." 

The next evening Jessie said in 
a small voice, "I've been reading 
the Bible. Lije." 

"What?" For a moment, Baley 
was bewildered. 

"The parts about Jezebel." 

"Oh! Jessie, I'm sorry if I hurt 
your feelings. I was being childish." 

"No. No." She pushed his hand 
from her waist and sat on the 
couch, cool and upright, with a 
definite space between them. "It's 
good to know the truth. I don't 
want to be fooled by not knowing. So I read about her. She was 
a wicked woman, Lije." 

"Well, her enemies wrote those 
chapters. We don't know her 
side." 



32 




 



"She killed all the prophets of 
the Lord that she could lay her 
hands on." 

"So they say." Baley felt about 
for a stick of chewing gum. He 
later abandoned that habit because Jessie said that with his 
long face and sad, brown eyes, 
it made him look like an old cow 
stuck with an unpleasant wad of 
grass it couldn't swallow and 
wouldn't spit out. 

He said, "If you want her side. 
I could think of some arguments 
for you. She followed the religion 
of her ancestors who had been in 
the land long before the Hebrews 
came. The Hebrews had their 
own God and, what's more, he 
was a jealous God. It wasn't 
enough for them to worship Him; 
everyone else had to worship Him 
as well. 

"Jezebel was a conservative, 
defending the old beliefs against 
the new ones. After all, even if 
the new beliefs had higher moral 
values, the old ones were more 
satisfying emotionally. The fact 
that she killed priests just marks 
her as a person of her times. It 
was the usual missionary method 
in those days. If you read I 
Kings, you must remember that 
Elijah (my namesake this time) 
had a contest with eight hundred and fifty prophets of Baal 
to see which could bring down 
fire from heaven. Elijah won and 
promptly ordered the crowd of 



onlookers to kill the eight hundred and fifty Baalites. And they 
did." 

^HE bit her lip. "What about 
^ Naboth's vineyard, Lije? Here 
was this Naboth not bothering 
anybody, except that he refused 
to sell the King his vineyard. So 
Jezebel arranged to have people 
perjure themselves and say that 
Naboth had committed blasphemy or something." 

"He was supposed to have 
'blasphemed God and the king.' " 
said Baley. 

"Yes. So they confiscated his 
property after they executed 
him." 

"That wasn't considered wrong 
then. In modern times, if the 
City or even if one of the 
Medieval nations had wanted 
Naboth's property, the courts 
would have ordered him off. had 
him removed by force if necessary, and paid him whatever they 
considered a fair price. King 
Ahab didn't have that kind of 
legal solution. He was sick and 
unhappy over the situation and 
Jezebel felt that her husband's 
welfare came ahead of Naboth's. 
I keep telling you, she was the 
model of a faithful wi — " 

Jessie flung herself away from 
him. "I think you're mean and 
spiteful." 

He looked at her with complete dismay. "What have I 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



33 



done? What's the matter with 
you?" 

She left the apartment without 
answering and spent the evening 
and half the night at the subetheric video levels, traveling 
petulantly from showing to showing and using up a two-month 
supply of her quota allowance 
(and her husband's). 

When she came back to a 
still wakeful Lije Baley, she had 
nothing further to say to him. 

It occurred to Baley later, 
much later, that he had smashed 
an important part of Jessie's life. 
Her name had signified something wicked and licentious to 
her. It was a delightful makeweight for her prim, respectable 
nature. It gave her an aroma. of 
vice and she adored that. 

But it was gone. She never 
mentioned her full name again, 
not to Lije, not to her friends 
and maybe, for all Baley knew, 
not even to herself. She was 
Jessie and took to signing her 
name so. 

A S the days passed, she began 
speaking to him again arid 
after a week or so, their relationship was on the old friendly 
footing and with all subsequent 
quarrels, nothing ever reached 
that one bad spot of intensity. 

Only once was there even an 
indirect reference to the matter. It 
was in her eighth month of preg


nancy. She had left her own 
position as dietitian's assistant in 
Section Kitchen A-23 and, with 
unaccustomed time on her hands, 
was amusing herself in speculation and preparation for the 
baby's birth. 

She said, one evening, "What 
about Bentley?" 

"Pardon me, dear?" said Baley, 
looking up from a sheaf of work 
he had brought home with him. 
(With an additional mouth to 
feed and Jessie's pay stopped 
and his own promotions to the 
non-clerical levels as far off, 
seemingly, as ever, extra work 
was necessary.) 

"I mean if the baby's a boy, 
what about Bentley as a name?" 

Baley pulled down the corners 
of his mouth. "Bentley Baley? 
Don't you think the names are 
too similar?" 

"I don't know. It has a swing, 
I think. Besides, the child can 
always pick out a middle name 
to suit himself when he gets 
older." 

"Well, it's all right with me." 

"Are you sure? I mean—maybe you wanted him to be named 
Elijah." 

"And be called Junior? I don't 
think that's a good idea. Jie can 
name his son Elijah, if he wants 
to." 

Then Jessie said, "There's just 
one thing," and stopped. 

After an interval, he looked up. 



34 




 



"What one thing?" 

She was red and she did not 
quite meet his eye, but she said, 
forcefully enough, "Bentley isn't 
a Bible name, is it?" 

"No," said Baley, "I'm quite 
sure it isn't." 

"All right, then. I don't want 
any Bible names." 

And that was the only harking 
back that took place from that 
time to the day when Elijah 
Baley was coming home with 
Robot Daneel Olivaw, when he 
had been married for more than 
eighteen years and when his son 
Bentley Baley (middle name still 
unchosen) was past sixteen. 

T>ALEY paused before the large 
" double door on which there 
glowed in large letters : PERSONAL—MEN. In smaller letters were written : Subsections 
1A — IE. In still smaller letters, 
just above the key-slit, it stated: 
"In Case of Loss of Key, Communicate at Once with 27-10151." 

A man inched past them, inserted an aluminum sliver into 
the key-slit and walked in. He 
closed the door behind him, making no attempt to hold it open 
for Baley. Had he done so, Baley 
would have been seriously offended. By custom, men disregarded 
one another's presence entirely 
either within or just outside the 
Personals. 



One of the more interesting 
postmarital confidences was Jessie's telling him that the situation was quite different at 
Women's Personals. It was one of 
the penalties of civic advancement that when the Baleys were 
granted permission for a small 
washbowl in their bedroom, Jessie's social life suffered. 

Baley said, without completely 
masking his embarrassment, 
"Please wait out here, Daneel." 

"Do you intend washing?" 
asked R. Daneel. 

Baley squirmed and thought: 
Damned robot ! If they were 
briefing him on everything under 
steel, why didn't they teach him 
manners? I'll be responsible if 
he ever says anything like this to 
anyone else. 

He said, "I'll shower. It gets 
crowded evenings. I'll lose time 
then. If I get it done now, we'll 
have the whole evening before 
us." 

R. Daneel's face maintained its 
repose. "Is it part of the social 
custom that I wait outside?" 

Baley's embarrassment deepened. "Why need you go in for — 
for no purpose?" 

"Oh, I understand you. Yes, of 
course. Nevertheless, Elijah, my 
hands grow dirty, too, and I will 
wash them." 

He indicated his palms, holding 
them out before him. They were 
pink and plump, with the proper 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



35 



creases. They bore every mark of 
excellent and meticulous workmanship and were as clean as 
need be. 

Baley said, "We have a washbasin in the apartment, you 
know." He said it casually. Snobbery would be lost on a robot. 

"Thank you for your kindness. 
On the whole, however, I think it 
would be preferable to make use 
of this place. If I am to live with 
you men of Earth, it is best that 
I adopt as many of your customs and attitudes as I can." 

"Come on in, then." 

The bright cheerfulness of the 
interior was a sharp contrast to 
the busy utilitarianism of most of 
the rest of the City, but it was all 
a blank on Baley's saturated 
retina. 

He whispered to Daneel, "I 
may take half an hour or so. 
Wait for me." He started away, 
then returned to add, "And don't 
talk to anybody and don't look 
at anybody. It's a custom." 

He looked hurriedly about to 
make certain that his own small 
conversation had not been noted, 
was not being met by secret 
shocked glances. Nobody, fortun•ately was in the ante -corridor, 
and after all, it was only the antecorridor. 

TTE hurried past the common 
chambers to the private 
stalls. It had been five years now 



since he had been awarded one — 
large enough to contain a shower, 
a small laundry and other necessities. It even had a small projector that could be keyed in for 
the news films. 

"A home away from home," he 
had joked when it was first made 
available to him. But now he 
often wondered how he would 
ever bear the adjustment back 
to the more Spartan existence of 
the common chambers if his stallprivileges were ever canceled. 

He pressed the button that 
activated the laundry and the 
smooth face of the meter lighted. 

R. Daneel was waiting patiently when Baley returned with a 
scrubbed body, clean underwear, 
a freshened shirt and, generally, 
a feeling of greater comfort. 

"No trouble?" Baley asked, 
when they were well outside the 
door and able to talk. 

"None at all, Elijah," said R. 
Daneel. 

Jessie was at the door, smiling 
nervously, when they arrived. 
Baley kissed her. 

"Jessie," he mumbled, "this is 
my new partner, Daneel Olivaw." 

Jessie held out a hand, which 
R. Daneel took and released. She 
turned to her husband, then 
looked timidly at R. Daneel. 

She said, "Won't you sit down. 
Mr. Olivaw? I must talk to my 
husband about some family matters. It'll take just a minute. I 



36 




 



hope you won't mind." 

Her hand was on Baley's sleeve. 
He followed her into the next 
room. 

She said, in a hurried whisper, 
"You aren't hurt, are you? I've 
been so worried ever since the 
broadcast." 

"What broadcast?" 

"About the riot at the shoe 
counter. They said two plainclothesmen stopped it. I knew 
you were coining home with a 
partner and this was right in our 
sub-section and just when you 
were coming home and I thought 
they were making it sound better 
than it was and you were — " 

"Please, Jessie. You see I'm 
perfectly all right." 

Jessie caught hold of herself 
with an effort. She said, shakily, 
"Your partner isn't from your 
division, is he?" 

"No," replied Baley miserably. 
"He's— a complete stranger." 

"How do I treat him?" 

"Like anybody else. He's just 
my partner, that's all." 

He said it so unconvincingly 
that Jessie's quick eyes narrowed. 
"What's wrong?" 

"Nothing. Come, let's go back 
into the "living room. It'll begin 
to look queer." 

T IJE Baley felt a little uncertain about the apartment 
now, though he had always been 
proud of it. It had three large 



rooms; the living room, for instance, was an ample fifteen feet 
by eighteen. There was a closet 
in each room. One of the main 
ventilation ducts passed directly 
by. It meant a rumbling noise, 
but, on the other hand, assured 
first-rate temperature control and 
well -conditioned air. Nor was the 
apartment far from either Personal, which was a prime convenience. 

But with the creature from 
worlds beyond space sitting in the 
midst of it, the apartment suddenly seemed cramped. 

Jessie said, with a gaiety that 
was slightly synthetic, "Have you 
and Mr. Olivaw eaten, Lije?" 

"As a matter of fact," said 
Baley quickly, "Daneel will not 
be eating with us. I will, though." 

Jessie accepted the situation 
without question. With food supplies so narrowly controlled, it 
was good form to refuse hospitality. 

She said, "I hope you won't 
mind our eating, Mr. Olivaw. 
Lije, Bentley and I generally eat 
at the Community Kitchen. 
There's more variety, and just 
between you and me, bigger helpings, too. But Lije and I do have 
permission to eat in our apartment three times a week if we 
want to — Lije is quite successful 
at the Bureau and we have very 
nice status — and I thought that 
just for this occasion, if you 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



37 



wanted to join us, we would have 
a little private feast of our own, 
though I do think that people 
who overdo their privacy privileges are anti -social." 

R. Daneel listened' politely. 

Baley said, with an undercover "shushing" wiggle of his 
fingers, "Jessie, I'm hungry." 

"Would I be breaking a custom, Mrs. Baley, if I addressed 
you by your given name?" R. 
Daneel asked. 

"Why, no, of course not" Jessie folded a table out of the wall 
and plugged the plate warmer 
into the central depression on the 
tabletop. "You go right ahead 
and call me Jessie all you like — 
uh— Daneel." She giggled. 

Baley was getting rapidly more 
uncomfortable. Jessie thought R. 
Daneel a man. The situation 
would be something to boast of 
and talk about in Women's Personal, He was good-looking in a 
wooden way, too, and Jessie was 
pleased with his deference. Anyone could see that. 

Baley wondered what R. 
Daneel thought of Jessie. She 
hadn't changed much in eighteen 
years, or at least not to Baley. 
She was heavier, of course, and 
her figure had lost its youthful 
vigor. But that's all beside the 
point, thought Baley somberly. 
On the Outer Worlds, the women 
were supposedly tall and as slim 
and regal as the men and those 



must be the kind of women R. 
Daneel was used to. 

But R. Daneel seemed quite 
unperturbed by Jessie's conversation, her appearance or her appropriation of his name. He said, 
"Are you sure that is proper? 
The name, Jessie, seems to be a 
diminutive. Perhaps its use is 
restricted to members of your 
immediate circle and I would be 
more proper if I used your full 
given name." 

Jessie, breaking open the insulating wrapper on the dinner 
ration, bent her head in sudden 
concentration. 

"Just Jessie," she said tightly. 

"Very well, Jessie." 

THE door opened and a youngster entered cautiously. His 
eyes found R. Daneel almost at 
once. 

"My son Bentley," said Baley. 
"This is Mr. Olivaw, Ben." 

"He's your partner, huh, Dad? 
How d'ye do, Mr. Olivaw." Ben's 
eyes grew large and luminous. 
"Say, Dad, what happened down 
in the shoe place? The newscast 
said — " 

"Don't ask any questions now, 
Ben." 

Bentley's face fell and he looked toward his mother, who motioned him to a seat. 

"Did you do what I told you, 
Bentley?" she asked, when he sat 
down. His hair was as dark as 



38 




 



his father's and he was going to 
have his father's height, but he 
had Jessie's oval face, her hazel 
eyes, her light-hearted way of 
looking at life. 

"Sure, Mom," said Bentley, 
hitching himself forward a bit to 
look into the double dish from 
which savory vapors were already 
rising. "What wc got to eat? Not 
zymoveal again, Mom? Huh, 
Mom?" 

"There's nothing wrong with 
zymoveal," said Jessie, her lips 
pressing together. "Now you just 
eat what's put before you and 
let's not have any comments." 

It was quite obvious they were 
having zymoveal. 

Baley took his own seat. He 
himself would have preferred 
something other than zymoveal, 
with its sharp flavor and definite 
aftertaste, but Jessie had explained her problem before this. 

"Well, I just can't, Lije," she 
had said. "I live right here on 
these levels all day and I can't 
make enemies or life wouldn't be 
bearable. They know I used to 
be assistant dietitian and if . I 
just walked off with steak or 
chicken every other week, when 
there's hardly any one else on the 
floor that has private eating privileges even just on Sunday, they'd 
say it was pull or friends in the 
prep -room. It would be talk, 
talk, talk, and I wouldn't be able 
to put my nose out the door or 



visit Personal in peace. As it is, 
zymoveal and protoveg are very 
good. They're well-balanced 
nourishment with no waste and, 
as a matter of fact, they're full of 
vitamins and minerals and everything anyone needs and we can 
have all the chicken we want 
when we eat in Community on 
the chicken Tuesdays." 

Baley gave in easily. It was as 
Jessie said — the first problem of 
living is to minimize resentment 
from the crowds that surround 
you on all sides. Bentley was a 
little harder to convince. 

TTE said, "Gee, Mom, why can't 
1 use Dad's ticket and eat in 
Community myself? I'd just as 
soon." 

Jessie shook her head in annoyance and said, "I'm surprised 
at you, Bentley. What would 
people say if they saw you eating by yourself as though your 
own family weren't good enough 
for you or had thrown you out 
of the apartment?" 

"Well, gosh, it's none of people's business." 

Baley said, with a nervous edge 
in his voice. "Do as your mother 
tells you, Bentley." 

Bentley shrugged unhappily. 

R. Daneel said suddenly, from 
the other side of the room, "Have 
I the family's permission to view 
these book -films during your 
meal?" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



39 



"Oh, sure," said Bentley, slipping away froi*i the table, a look 
of instant inter; est upon his face. 
"They're mine^ I got them from 
the library on special school permit. I'll get you my viewer. Ifs 
a pretty good one. Dad gave it 
to me for my l^st birthday." 

He brought it to R. Daneel 
and asked, "Are you interested in 
robots, Mr. OJivaw?" 

Baley abruptly dropped his 
spoon and bent to pick it up. 

R. Daneel ssdd, "Yes, Bentley. 
I am quite interested." 

"Then you'll like these. They're 
all about robots. I've got to write 
an essay on them for school, so 
I'm doing research. It's quite a 
complicated subject," he explained importantly. "I'm against 
them myself." 

"Sit down, Bentley," said 
Baley unhappily, "and don't 
bother Mr. Olivaw." 

"He's not bothering me, Elijah. 
I'd like to tall* to you about the 
problem another time, Bentley. 
Your father a n d I will be very 
busy tonight." 

"Thanks, M*. Olivaw." Bentley 
took his seat $md with a look of 
accusation in Ins mother's direction, cut off a portion of the pink 
zymoveal with his fork. 

Baley thought: Busy tonight? 
Then, with at resounding shock, 
he remember-ed his job. He 
thought of a Spacer lying dead 
in Spacetown and realized that, 



for hours, he had been so involved with his own deadly dilemma that he had forgotten the 
cold fact of murder. 

CHAPTER V 

JESSIE said good-by to them. 
She was wearing a formal hat 
and a little jacket of keratofiber 
as she said, "I hope you'll excuse 
me, Mr. Olivaw. I know you have 
a great deal to discuss with Lije." 

She pushed her son ahead of 
her after she opened the door. 

"When will you be back, Jessie?" asked Baley. 

She paused. "When do you 
want me to be back?" 

"Well, no use staying out all 
night. Why don't you come back 
your usual time? Midnight or 
so." He looked doubtfully at R. 
Daneel. 

R. Daneel nodded. "I regret 
having to drive you from your 
home." 

"Don't worry about that, Mr. 
Olivaw. This is my usual evening 
out with the girls, anyway. Come 
on, Ben." 

The youngster was rebellious. 
"Aw, why the dickens do I have 
to go? I'm not going to bother 
them. Yeast!" 

"Now do as I say." 

"Well, why can't I go to the 
etherics along with you?" 

"Because I'm going with some 
friends and you've got other 



40 




 



things — n The door closed behind 
them. 

The moment had come. Baley 
had put it off in his mind. He 
had thought: First let's meet the 
robot and see what he's like. 
Then it was: Let's get him home. 
And then: Lefs eat. 

But now there was no excuse 
for further delay. It was down 
at last to the question of murder, 
of interstellar complications, of 
possible raises in ratings, of possible disgrace and declassification. And he had no way of even 
beginning except to turn to the 
robot for help. 

His fingernails moved aimlessly on the table, which had not 
been returned to its wall recess. 

R. Daneel said, "How secure 
are we against being overheard?" 

Baley looked up, surprised. 
"No one would listen to what's 
going on in another man's apartment." 

"It is not your custom to 
eavesdrop?" 

"You might as well suppose 
they'd — I don't know — that 
they'd look in your plate while 
you're eating." 

"Or that they would commit 
murder?" 

"What?" 

"It is against your customs to 
kill, is it not, Elijah?" 

Baley felt anger rising. "See 
here, if we're going to be partners, 
don't try to imitate Spacer arro


gance. There's no room for it in 
you, R. Daneel." He could not 
resist emphasizing the "R." 

"I am sorry if I have hurt your 
feelings, Elijah. My intention was 
only to indicate that, since human beings are occasionally capable of murder in defiance of 
custom, they may be able to violate custom for the smaller impropriety of eavesdropping." 

"The apartment is adequately 
insulated," said Baley, still irritated. "You haven't heard anything from the apartments on 
any side of us, have you? Well, 
they won't hear us, either. Besides, why should anvone think 
anything of importance is going 
on here?** 

"We must not underestimate 
the enemy." 

T>ALEY shrugged. "Let's get 
started. My information is* 
sketchy, so I can lay out my 
hand without much trouble. I 
know that a man named Roj 
Nemennuh Sarton, a citizen of 
the planet Aurora and a resident 
of Spacetown, has been murdered 
by person or persons unknown. I 
understand that it is the opinion 
of the Spacers that this is not an 
isolated event. Am I right?" 

"You are entirely right, Elijah." 

"They tie it up with recent attempts to sabotage the Spacersponsored project of converting 
us to an integrated human/robot 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



41 



society on the model of the Outer 
Worlds, and assume the murder 
was the product of a well-organized terrorist group." 
"Yes." 

"Then to begin with, is this 
Spacer theory necessarily true? 
Why can't the murder have been 
the work of an isolated fanatic? 
There is strong anti-robot sentiment on Earth, but there are no 
organized parties advocating violence of this sort." 

"Not openly, perhaps." 

"Even a group conspiring to 
destroy robots and robot-factories would have the common 
sense to realize that the worst 
thing they could do would be to 
murder a Spacer. It seems much 
more likely to have been the work 
of an unbalanced mind." 

R. Daneel thought carefully, 
then said, "I think the weight of 
probability is against the 'fanatic' 
theory. The person killed was too 
well-chosen and the time of the 
murder too appropriate for anything but deliberate planning." 

"Well, then, you've got more 
information than I have. Spill it!" 

"Your phraseology is obscure, 
but I think I understand. I will 
have to explain some of the background to you. As seen from 
Spacetown, Elijah, relations with 
Earth are unsatisfactory." 

"Tough," muttered Baley cold
ly. 

"I have been told that when 



Spacetown was first established, 
most of our people assumed 
Earth would be willing to adopt 
the integrated society that has 
worked so well on the Outer 
Worlds. Even after the first riots, 
we thought that it was only a 
matter of your people getting 
over the first shock of novelty. 
That has not proven to be the 
case. Even with the cooperation 
of the Terrestrial government and 
of most of the various City governments, resistance has been 
continuous and progress has been 
very slow. Naturally, this has 
been a matter of great concern 
to our people." 

"Out of altruism, I suppose." 

"Not entirely," said R. Daneel, 
"although it is good of you to 
attribute worthy motives to them. 
It is our common belief that a 
healthy and modernized Earth 
would be of great benefit to the 
whole Galaxy. At least it is the 
common belief among our people 
at Space town. I must admit that 
there are strong elements opposed 
to them on the Outer Worlds." 

"What? Disagreement among 
the Spacers?" 

"Certainly. There are some who 
think that a modernized Earth 
will be a dangerous empire building Earth. This is particularly true among the populations 
of those older worlds. They are 
closer to Earth and have greater 
reason to remember the first few 



42 




 



centuries of interstellar travel 
when their worlds were controlled, politically and economically, by Earth," 

T IJE Baley sighed. "Ancient 
^ history. Are they really worried? Are they still sore at us for 
things that happened a thousand 
years ago?" 

"Humans," said R. Daneel, 
"have their own peculiar makeup. They are not as reasonable, 
in many ways, as robots, since 
their circuits are more reactive 
than logical. I am told that this, 
too, has its advantages." 

"Perhaps it may," said Baley 
drily. 

"You are in a better position 
to know. In any case, continuing 
failure on Earth has strengthened the Nationalist parties on 
the Outer Worlds. They say it is 
obvious that Earthmen are different from Spacers and that if we 
imposed robots on Earth by superior force, we would be loosing 
destruction on the Galaxy. 
Earth's population is eight billions, while the total population 
of the fifty Outer Worlds combined is scarcely more than five 
and a half billions. Our people 
here, particularly Dr. Sarton — " 

"He was a doctor?" 

"A Doctor of Sociology, specializing in robotics, and a very 
brilliant man." 

"I see. Go on." 



"Dr. Sarton felt that the time 
had come to make a supreme 
effort to understand the psychology of the Earthman. It is easy 
to say that your people are innately conservative and to speak 
tritely of 'the unchanging Earth' 
and 'the inscrutable Terrestrial 
mind/ but Dr. Sarton said we 
could not dismiss the Earthman 
with a proverb or a bromide. He 
claimed the Spacers who were 
trying to remake Earth must 
abandon the isolation of Spacetown and mingle with Earthmen. 
They must live as they, think as 
they, be as they." 

Baley said, "The Spacers? Impossible." 

"You are quite right," agreed 
R. Daneel. "Despite his views, 
Dr. Sarton himself could not have 
brought himself to enter any of 
the Cities and he knew it. He 
would have been unable to bear 
the noise and rush of the crowds. 
Even if he had been forced inside 
at the point of a blaster, the turmoil would have distracted him 
so that he could never have 
penetrated the truths for which 
he sought." 

"What about the way they're 
always worrying about disease?" 
demanded Baley. "Don't forget 
that. I don't think there's one of 
them who would risk entering a 
City for that reason alone." 

"There is that, too. Disease in 
the Earthly sense is unknown 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



43 



on the Outer Worlds and the fear 
of the unknown is always morbid. 
Dr. Sarton appreciated all of this 
and, nevertheless, he insisted on 
the necessity of growing to know 
the Earthman and his' way of life 
intimately." 

"He seems to have worked himself into a corner/' 

"Not quite. The objections to 
entering the City hold for human 
Spacers. Robot Spacers are another thing entirely." 

TJALEY thought: I keep forgetting, damn it. Aloud, he 
said, "Oh?" 

"Yes," said R. Daneel. "We 
can be designed for adaptation to 
Earthly conditions. We could be 
accepted by Earthmen and allowed a closer view of their life." 

"And you yourself — " began 
Baley in sudden enlightenment. 

"Am just such? a robot. For a 
year, Dr. Sarton has been working upon the design and construction. I was the first of his 
robots and so far the only one. 
Unfortunately, my education is 
not yet complete. I have been 
hurried into my role prematurely 
as a result of the murder." 

• "Then not all Spacer robots are 
like you? I mean some look more 
like robots and less like humans. 
Right?" 

"Why, naturally. The outward 
appearance is dependent on a 
robot's function. My own func


tion requires a very manlike appearance. Others are different, 
although all are humanoid. Certainly they are more humanoid 
than the primitive models I saw 
at the shoe counter. Are all your 
robots being manufactured like 
that?" 

"More or less," said Baley. 
"You don't approve?" 

"It is difficult to accept a gross 
parody of the human form as an 
intellectual equal. Can your factories do no better?" 

"I'm sure they can, Daneel. I 
think we just prefer to know 
when we're dealing with a robot 
and when we're not." He stared 
directly into the robot's eyes as 
he said that. They were bright 
and moist, as a human's would 
be, but it seemed to Baley that 
their gaze was steady and did not 
flicker slightly from point to 
point as a man's would. 

R. Daneel said, "I am hopeful 
that in time I will grow to understand that point of view." 

For an instant, Baley thought 
there was sarcasm in the remark, 
then dismissed the possibility. 
The robot was undoubtedly being quite sincere. 

"In any case," said R. Daneel, 
"Dr. Sarton saw clearly the fact 
that it was a case for C/Fe." 
"What's that?" 

"Just the chemical symbols for 
the elements carbon and iron, 
Elijah. Carbon is the basis of 


 



human life, and iron of robot 
life. It becomes easy to speak of 
C/Fe when you wish to express 
a culture that combines the best 
of the two on an equal but parallel basis." 

"See fee. Do you write it with 
a hyphen or how?" 

"No, Elijah. A diagonal line 
between the two is the accepted 
way. It symbolizes neither one 
nor the other, but a mixture of 
the two, without priority." 

A GAINST his will, Baley found 
himself interested. Formal 
education on Earth included virtually no information on Outer 
World history or sociology after 
the Great Rebellion that made 
them independent of the mother 
planet. The popular book- film 
romances, to be sure, had their 



stock Outer World characters: 
the visiting tycoon, choleric and 
eccentric; the beautiful heiress, 
invariably smitten by the Earthman's charms; the arrogant 
Spacer rival, wicked and forever 
beaten. These were worthless 
sources, since Spacers never entered Cities and Spacer women 
virtually never visited Earth. 

For the first time in his life, 
Baley was stirred by an odd curiosity. What was Spacer life really 
like? 

He said, "I think I get what 
you're driving at. Your Dr. Sarton was attacking the problem 
of Earth's conversion to C/Fe 
from a new and promising angle. 
Our conservative groups — Medievalists, as they call themselves — 
were perturbed. They were afraid 
he might succeed. So they killed 




THE CAVES OF STEEL

him. That's the motivation that 
makes ' it an organized plot and 
not an isolated outrage. Right?" 
"Quite right." 

BaleV whistled thoughtfully 
under his breath. His long fingers 
tapped lightly against the table. 
Then he shook his head. "It won't 
wash. It won't wash at all." 

"I do not understand." 

"An Earthman walks into 
Spacetown, walks up to Dr. Sarton, blasts him, and walks out. 
But the entrance to Spacetown is 
guarded." 

R, Daneel nodded. "No Earthman can possibly have passed 
through the entrance illegally." 

"Then where does that leave 
you?" 

"It would leave us in a confusing position, Elijah, if the entrance- were the only way of 
reaching Spacetown from New 
York City." 

Baley watched his partner 
thoughtfully. "I don't get you. 
It's the only connection between 
the two." 

"Directly between the two, 
yes. May I have a piece of paper 
and a writer? Thank you. Look, 
partner Elijah. I will draw a big 
circle and label it 'New York 
City.' Now, tangent to it. I will 
draw a small circle and label it 
'Spacetown.' Here, where they 
touch. I draw an arrowhead and 
label it 'Barrier.' Now do you see 
no other connection?" 



Baley said, "Of course not. 
There is no other connection." 

"In a way, I am glad to hear 
you say this. It is in accordance 
with what I have been taught 
about terrestrial ways of thinking. The Barrier is the only direct 
connection. But both the City 
and Spacetown are open to the 
countryside in all directions. It is 
possible for a Terrestrial to leave 
the City at any of numerous exits 
and strike out cross-country to 
Spacetown, where no Barrier will 
stop him." 

THE tip of Baley's tongue 
touched his upper lip and for 
a moment stayed there. Then he 
said, "Cross-country?" 
"Yes." 

" Cross -country! Alone?" 
"Why not?" 
"Walking?" 

"That would offer the least 
chance of detection. The murder 
took place early in the working 
day and the trip was undoubtedly negotiated before dawn." 

"Impossible! There isn't a man 
in the City who would do it. 
Leave the City? Alone?" 

"Ordinarily, it would seem unlikely. We Spacers know that, 
It is why we guard only the entrance. Even in the Great Riot, 
your people attacked only at the 
Barrier that then protected the 
entrance. Not one left the City." 

"Well, then?" 



46 




 



"Now we are dealing with an 
unusual situation. It is not the 
blind attack of a mob following 
the line of least resistance, but 
the organized attempt of a small 
group to strike deliberately at the 
unguarded point. It explains why, 
as you say, a Terrestrial could 
enter Spacetown, walk up to his 
victim, kill him, and walk away. 
The man attacked through a 
complete blind spot on our part." 

Baley shook his head. "It's too 
unlikely. Have your people done 
anything to check that theory?" 

"Yes, we have. Your Commissioner of Police was present almost at the time of the murder — " 

"I know. He told me so." 

"That, Elijah, is another example of the timeliness of the 
murder. Your Commissioner has 
cooperated with Dr. Sarton in the 
past and he was the Earthman 
with whom Dr. Sarton planned 
to make initial arrangements for 
the infiltration of your City by 
robots such as myself. The appointment for that morning was 
to concern that. The murder, of 
course, stopped those plans, at 
least temporarily. The fact that 
it happened when your own Commissioner of Police was actually 
within Spacetown made the entire situation more difficult and 
embarrassing for Earth, and for 
our own people, too. 

"But that is not what I started 
to say. Your Commissioner was 



present. We said to him, 'The 
man must have come crosscountry.' Like you, he said, 
'Impossible' or perhaps 'Unthinkable.' He was quite disturbed, of 
course, and perhaps that may 
have made it difficult for him to 
see the essential point. Nevertheless, we forced him, to begin 
checking that possibility almost 
at once." 

T> ALEY thought of the Commissioner's broken glasses 
and, even in the middle of grim 
thoughts, a corner of his mouth 
twitched. Poor Julius ! Yes, he 
would be disturbed. There would 
be no way for Enderby to have 
explained the situation to the 
lofty Spacers, who looked upon 
physical disability as a peculiarly disgusting attribute of the nongenetically selected Earthmen. 
That is, he couldn't without losing face, and face was valuable 
to Police Commissioner Julius 
Enderby. Well, Earthmen had to 
stick together in some respects. 
The robot would never find out 
about Enderby's nearsightedness 
from Baley. 

R. Daneel continued, "One by 
one, the various exit points from 
the City were investigated. Do 
you know how many there are, 
Elijah?" 

Baley hazarded, "Twenty?" 

"Five hundred and two." 

"How many?" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



47 



"Originally, there were far 
more. Your City represents a 
slow growth, Elijah. It was once 
open to the sky and people 
crossed from City to country 
freely." 

"I know that." 

"Well, when it was first enclosed, there were many exits 
left. Five hundred and two still 
remain. The rest are built over 
or blocked up. We are not counting, of course, the entrance points 
for air-freight." 

"Well, what of the exit points?" 

"They are unguarded. We 
could find no official who was in 
charge or who considered them 
under his jurisdiction. A man 
could have walked out of any of 
them at any time and returned 
at will. He would never have 
been detected." 

"Anything else? The weapon 
was gone, I suppose." 

"Oh, yes." 

"Any clues of any sort?" 

"None. We have investigated 
the grounds surrounding Spacetown thoroughly. The robots on 
the truck farms were quite useless as possible witnesses. They 
were little more than automatic 
farm machinery; scarcely humanoid. And there were no 
humans." 

"TJh-huh. What next?" 

"Having failed, so far, at one 
end, Spacetown, we will work at 
the other, New York City. It 



will be our duty to track down all 
possible subversive groups, to sift 
all dissident organizations — " 

"How much time do you intend to spend?" interrupted 
Baley. 

"As little as possible, as much 
as necessary." 

"W7ELL," said Baley, thought *» fully, "I wish you had another partner in this mess." 

"I do not," said R. Daneel. 
"The Commissioner spoke very 
highly of your loyalty and ability." 

"It was nice of him," said Baley 
sardonically. He thought: Poor 
Julius. I*m on his conscience and 
he tries hard. 

"We didn't rely entirely on 
him," said R. Daneel. "We checked your records. You have expressed yourself openly against 
the use of robots in your department." 

"Oh? Do you object?" 

"Not at all. Your opinions are 
your own. But it made it necessary for us to check your psychological profile very closely. 
We know that although you dislike robots intensely, you will 
work with one if you conceive it 
to be your duty. You have an 
extraordinarily high loyalty index 
and a respect for legitimate authority. It is what we need. Commissioner Enderby judged you 
well." 



48 




 



"You have no personal resentment toward my anti-robot sentiments?" 

R. Daneel said, "If they do not 
prevent you from working with 
me and helping me do what is 
required of me, how can they 
matter?" 

Baley felt stopped. He said belligerently, "Well, then, if I pass 
the test, how about you? What 
makes you a detective?" 

"I do not understand you." 

"You were designed as an information-gathering machine. A 
man-imitation to record the facts 
of human life for the Spacers." 

"That is a good beginning for 
an investigator, is it not, to be 
an information-gathering machine?" 

"A beginning, maybe. But it's 
not all there is, by a long shot." 

"To be sure, there has been a 
final adjustment of my circuits." 

"I'd be curious to hear the details of that, Daneel." 

"That is easy enough. A particularly strong drive has been 
inserted into my motivation 
banks — a desire for justice." 

"Justice!" cried Baley. The 
irony faded from his face and 
was replaced by a look of the 
most earnest distrust. 

But R. Daneel turned swiftly in 
his chair and stared at the door. 
"Someone is out there." 

The door opened and Jessie, 
pale and thin-lipped, walked in. 



Startled, Baley explained, 
"Why, Jessie ! Is anything 
wrong?" 

She stood there, eyes not meeting his. "I'm sorry. I had to — " 
Her voice trailed off. 

"Where's Bentley?" 

"He's to stay the night in the 
Youth HfllL" 

"Why? I didn't tell you to do 
that." 

"You said your partner would 
stay the night. I felt he would 
«need Bentley's room.** 

R. Daneel said, "There was no 
necessity, Jessie." 

Jessie lifted her eyes to R. 
Daneel's face, staring at it earnestly. 

Baley looked at his fingertips, 
sick at what might follow, somehow unable to interpose. The 
momentary silence pressed thickly on his eardrums and then far 
away, as though through folds 
of plastex, he heard his wife say, 
"I think you are a robot, Daneel." 

And R. Daneel replied, in a 
voice as calm as ever, "I am." 

CHAPTER VI 

ON the uppermost levels of 
some of the wealthiest subsections of the City are the natural Solariums, where a partition

est administrators and executives 
may tan themselves. A unique 
thing happens there every evening. 

Night falls. 

In the rest of the -City (including the UV-Solariums, where the 
millions, in strict sequence of allotted time, might occasionally 
expose themselves to the artificial wavelengths of arc-lights) 
there are only the arbitrary cycles 
of hours. 

The business of the City might 
easily have continued in three 
eight-hour or four six-hour shifts, 
by "day" and "night" alike. Light 
and work could easily proceed 
endlessly. There were always 
civic reformers who periodically 
suggested such a filing in the 
interests of economy and efficiency. 

The notion was never accepted. 

Much of the earlier habits of 
Earthly society had been given 
up in the interests of that same 
economy and efficiency: space, 
privacy, even much of free will. 
They were the products of civilization, however, and not more 
than ten thousand years old. 

The adjustment of sleep to 
night, however, was as old as 
Man — a million years. Although 
the evening was unseen, apartment lights dimmed as the hours 
of darkness passed and the City's 
pulse sank. No one could have 
told noon from midnight by any 



cosmic phenomenon along the enclosed avenues of the City, yet 
mankind followed the mute partitionings of the hour-hand. 

The Expressways emptied, the 
noise of life fell, the moving mob 
among the colossal alleys melted 
away; New York City lay in 
Earth's unnoticed shadow, and its 
population slept. 

Elijah Baley did not sleep. He 
lay in bed and there was no light 
in his apartment, but that was 
as far as it went. 

Jessie lay next to him, motionless in the darkness. He had not 
felt nor heard her move. 

On the other side of the wall 
sat, stood, lay (Baley wondered 
which) R. Daneel Olivaw. 

Baley whispered, "Jessie!" 

The dark figure beside him 
stirred slightly under the sheet. 
"What do you want?" 

"Jessie, don't make it worse 
for me," 

"You might have told me." 

"How could I? I was planning 
to, when I could think of a way. 
Jehoshaphat, Jessie — " 

"Sh!" 

Baley's voice returned to its 
whisper. "How did you find out? 
Won't you tell me?" 

JESSIE turned toward him." He 
could sense her eyes looking 
through the darkness at him. 

"Lije." Her voice was scarcely 
more than a stirring of air. "Can 



50 




 



he hear us, do you think?" 

"Not if we whisper." 

"How do you know? Maybe 
he has special hearing to pick 
up tiny sounds. Spacer robots 
can do all sorts of things." 

Baley knew that the pro-robot 
propaganda was forever stressing 
the miraculous feats of the Spacer 
robots; their endurance, their extra senses, their service to humanity in a hundred novel ways. 
Personally, he thought that approach defeated itself. Earthmen 
hated the robots all the more for 
their superiority. 

He whispered, "Not Daneel. 
They wanted him to be accepted 
as a human being, so he must 
have only human senses." 

"How do you know?" 

"If he had extra senses, there 
would be too much danger of his 
giving himself away as nonhuman by accident. He would do 
too much, know too much." 

"Well, maybe." 

A minute passed and Baley 
tried a second time. "Jessie, if 
you'll just let things be until — 
until — Look, dear, it's unfair of 
you to be angry." 

"Angry? Oh, Lije, you fool! 
I'm not angry. I'm scared; I'm 
scared clean to death." 

For a while, they clung together, and Baley's growing sense 
of injury evaporated into a 
troubled concern. 

"Why, Jessie? There's nothing 



to be worried about. He's harmless. You know he can't hurt 
humans." 

"Can't you get rid of him, 
Lije?" 

"It's Department business. 
How can I?" 

"What kind of business, Lije? 
Tell me." 

"Now, Jessie, I'm surprised at 
you." He groped for her cheek 
in the darkness and patted it. It 
was wet. Using his pajama sleeve, 
he carefully wiped her eyes. 
"Now, look, you're being a baby." 

"Tell them at the Department 
to have someone else do it, whatever it is. Please, Lije." 

Baley's voice hardened a bit. 
"Jessie, you've been a policeman's 
wife long enough to know an 
assignment is an assignment." 

"Well, why did it have to be 
you?" 

"Julius Enderby — " 

She stiffened in his arms. "I 
might have known. Why can't 
you tell Julius Enderby to have 
someone else do the dirty work 
just once?" 

ENDERBY had been a fighting 
word with them since their 
engagement. He had been two 
classes ahead of Baley at the City 
School of Administrative Studies. 
They had been friends. When 
Baley had taken his battery of 
aptitude tests and neuroanalysis 
and found himself in line for the 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



51 



police force, Enderby was already 
there before him, Enderby had 
moved into the plainclothes division. 

Baley followed Enderby, but 
at a continually greater distance. 
Baley was capable enough, efficient enough, but he lacked 
something that Enderby had. 
Enderby fitted the administrative 
machine perfectly. He was one of 
those persons born for a bureaucracy. The Commissioner wasn't a 
great brain, and Baley knew it. 
He had his childish peculiarities, 
his intermittent rash of ostentatious Medievalism, for instance. 
But offended no one; he took 
orders grace r ully; he gave them 
with the proper mixture of gentleness and firmness. He even 
got along' with the Spacers, 
though perhaps too obsequious 
to them. (Baley himself could 
never have dealt with them for 
half a day without getting into a 
state of bristle; he was sure of 
that, even though he had never 
really spoken to a Spacer.) But 
they trusted Enderby and that 
made him extremely useful to 
the City. 

So, in a Civil Service where 
smooth and sociable performance 
was more useful than an individualistic competence, Enderby 
went up the scale quickly, and 
was at the Commissioner level 
when Baley was nothing more 
than a C-5. Baley did not resent 



the contrast, though he was human enough to regret it. Enderby 
did not forget their earlier friendship and, in his queer way, tried 
to make up for his success by 
doing what he could for Baley. 

The assignment of partnership 
with R. Daneel was one example. 
It was tough and unpleasant, but 
there was no question that it carried the promise of tremendous 
advancement. The Commissioner 
might have given the chance to 
someone else. His own talk, that 
morning, of needing a favor, 
masked but did not hide that 
fact. 

Jessie never saw things that 
way. On similar occasions in the 
past, she had said, "It's your silly 
loyalty index. I'm so tired of 
hearing everyone praise you for 
being so full of a sense of duty. 
Think of yourself once in a while. 
I notice the ones on top don't 
bring up the topic of their own 
loyalty index." 

Baley lay in bed in a state of 
stiff wakefulness, letting Jessie 
calm down. He had to think. He 
had to be certain of his suspicions. .Little things chased one 
another and fitted together in his 
mind. Slowly, they were building 
into a pattern, „ 

TIE felt the mattress give as 
Jessie stirred. 
"Lije?" Her lips were at his ear. 
"Why don't you resign?" 



52 




 



"Don't be crazy." 

"Why not?" She was suddenly 
almost eager. "You can get rid 
of that horrible robot that way. 
Just walk in and tell Enderby 
you're through." 

Baley said coldly, "I can't resign in the middle of an important case. I can't throw the 
whole thing down the disposal 
tube just any time I feel like it. 
A trick like that means declassification for cause." 

"You can work your way up 
again. You can do it, Lije." 

"Civil Service doesn't take 
men who are declassified for 
cause. Manual labor is the only 
thing I can do; the only thing 
you could do. Bentley would lose 
all inherited status. For God's 
sake, Jessie, you don't know what 
it's like." 

"I've read about it. I'm not 
afraid of it." 

"You're crazy. You're plain 
crazy." Baley could feel himself 
trembling. There was a familiar, 
flashing picture of his father in 
his mind's eye. His father, moldering away toward death. 

Jessie sighed heavily. 

Baley's mind turned savagely 
away from her. In desperation, 
it returned to the pattern it was 
constructing. 

He said tightly, "Jessie, you've 
got to tell me. How did you find 
out Daneel was a robot? What 
made you decide that?" 



She began, "Well — " and just 
ran down. It was the third time 
she had tried to explain and 
failed. 

He crushed her hand in his, 
willing her to speak. "Please, 
Jessie. What's frightening you?" 

She said, "I just guessed he 
was a robot, Lije." 

He said, "There wasn't anything to make you guess that, 
Jessie. You didn't think he was 
a robot before you left, now did 
you?" 

"No-o, but I got to thinking — " 
"Come on, Jessie. What was 
it?" 

"Well — the girls were talking 
in the Personal. You know how 
they are. Just talking about 
everything." 

Women! thought Baley. 

"Anyway," said Jessie. "The 
rumor is all over town. It must 
be." 

OALEY felt a quick and sav" age touch of triumph. Another piece in place! 

"All over town?" he repeated. 

"It was the way they sounded. 
They said there was talk about a 
Spacer robot loose in the City. 
He was supposed to look just like 
a man and to be working with the 
police. They even asked me 
about it. They laughed and said, 
'Does your Lije know anything 
about it, Jessie?' And I laughed 
and said, 'Don't be silly!' 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



53 



"Then we went to the etherics 
and I got to thinking about your 
new partner. Do you remember 
those pictures you brought home, 
the ones Julius Enderby took in 
Spacetown, to show me what 
Spacers looked like? Well, I got 
to thinking that's what your partner looked like. I said to myself, 
Oh, my God, someone must've 
recognized him in the shoe department and he's with Lije and 
I just said I had a headache and 
I ran — " 

Baley said, "Now, Jessie, get 
hold of yourself. You're not 
afraid of Daneel himself. You 
faced up to him when you came 
home." 

His teeth bit his last word in 
two. He sat up in bed, eyes uselessly wide in the darkness. 

He felt his wife move against 
his side. His hand leaped, found 
her lips and pressed against them. 
She heaved against his grip, her 
hands grasping his wrist and 
wrenching, but he leaned down 
against her still more heavily. 

Then, suddenly, he released 
her. She whimpered. 

He said huskily, "Sorry, Jessie. 
I was listening." 

He got out of bed, pulled 
warm Plastofilm over the soles 
of his feet. 

"Lije, where are you going? 
Don't leave me." 

"It's all right. I'm just going 
to the door." 



The Plastofilm made a soft, 
shuffling noise as he circled the 
bed. He cracked the door to the 
living room and watted a long 
moment Nothing happened. It 
was so quiet, he could hear the 
thin whistle of Jessie's breath 
from their bed and the dull 
rhythm of his pulse in his ears. 

TTIS hand crept through the 
opening of the door, snaking 
out to the spot he needed no 
light to find. His fingers closed 
upon the knob that controlled 
the ceiling illumination. He exerted the smallest pressure he 
could and the ceiling gleamed 
dimly, so dimly that the lower 
half of the living room remained 
in semi-dusk. 

He saw enough, however. The 
main door was closed and the 
living room lay lifeless and quiet. 

He wrenched the knob back 
into the off position and scuttled 
back to bed. 

It was all he needed. The pieces 
joined. The pattern was complete. 

Jessie pleaded with him, "Lije, 
what's wrong?" 

"Nothing's wrong, Jessie. Everything's all right. He's not 
here." 

"The robot? Do you meanJie's 
gone? For good?" 

"No, no. He'll be back. And 
before he does, answer my question." 

"What question?" 



54 




 



"What arc you afraid of?" 

Jessie said nothing. 

Baley grew more insistent. 
"You said you were scared to 
death." 

"Of him." 

"No, we went through that." 

Her words came slowly. "I 
thought if everyone knew he was 
a robot there might be a riot. 
We'd be killed." 

"Why us?" 

"You know what riots are 
like." 

"They don't even know where 
the robot is, do they?" 

"They might find out." 

"And thaf s what you're afraid 
of, a riot?" 

"Well—" 

"Sh!" He pressed Jessie down 
to the pillow. Then he put his 
lips to her ear. "He's come 
back. Now listen and don't say 
a word. Everything's fine. He'll 
be gone in the morning and he 
won't be back. There'll be no 
riot, nothing." 

He was almost contented as 
he said that. He felt he could 
sleep. 

He thought again: No riot, 
nothing. 

And no declassification. 

And just before he actually fell 
asleep, he thought: Not even a 
murder investigation. Not even 
that. 

The whole thing's solved — 
He slept. 



CHAPTER VII 

"PNDERBY polished his glasses with exquisite care and 
placed them upon the bridge of 
his nose. 

Baley thought: It's a good 
trick. Keeps you busy while 
you're thinking what to say, and 
it doesn't cost money the way 
lighting up a pipe does. 

And because the thought had 
entered his mind, he drew out 
his pipe and dipped into his 
pinched store of rough-cut. One 
of the few luxury crops still 
grown on Earth was tobacco, and 
its end was visibly approaching. 
Prices had gone up, never down, 
in Baley's lifetime: quotas down, 
never up. 

Enderby, having adjusted his 
glasses, felt for the switch at one 
end of his desk and flicked his 
door into one-way transparency 
for a moment. "Where is he now, 
Lije?" 

"He told me he wanted to be 
shown through the department, 
and I let Jack Tobin do the 
honors." Baley lit his pipe and 
tightened its baffle carefully. The 
Commissioner, like most non-indulgers, was petty about tobacco 
smoke. 

"I hope you didn't tell him 
Daneel was a robot." 

"Of course I didn't." 

The Commissioner did not relax. One hand remained aimlessly 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



55 



busy with the automatic calendar on his desk. 

"How is it?" he asked, without 
looking at Baley. 

"Middling rough." 

"I'm sorry, Lije'." 

Baley said firmly, "You might 
have warned me that he looked 
completely human." 

The Commissioner showed surprise. "I didn't?" Then, with sudden petulance, "Damn it, you 
should have known. I wouldn't 
have asked you to have him stay 
at your house if he looked like R. 
Sammy, would I?" 

"I know. Commissioner, but I'd 
never seen a robot like that and 
you had. I didn't even know such 
things were possible. I just wish 
you'd mentioned it, that's all." 

"I'm sorry. I should have told 
you. But this job has me so on 
edge that half the time I'm snapping at people fpr no reason. He — 
I mean this Daneel thing — is a 
new-type robot. It's still in the 
experimental stage." 

"He said so himself." 

"Oh. WeU, that's it." 

Baley tensed a little. He said 
casually, teeth clenched on pipestem, "R. Daneel has arranged a 
trip to Spacetown for me." 

"To Spacetown V Enderby 
looked up with indignation. 

"Yes. It's the logical next move, 
Commissioner. I'd like to see the 
scene of the crime; ask a few 
questions." 



JULIUS Enderby shook his 
head decidedly. "I don't think 
thafs a good idea, Lije. We've 
gone over the ground. I doubt 
there's anything new to be learned. And they're strange people. 
They've got to be handled with 
Plastoftlm gloves. You don't have 
the experience." He added, with 
unexpected fervor, "I hate them!" 

Baley injected hostility into 
his voice. "The robot came here 
and I should go there. It's bad 
enough sharing a front seat with 
a robot; I hate to take a back 
seat. Of course, if you don't think 
I'm capable of running this investigation, Commissioner — " 

"It isn't that, Lije. It's not you, 
it's the Spacers. You don't know 
what they're like." 

"Well, then, suppose you come 
along." 

"No, Lije, I won't go there! 
Don't ask me to!" More quietly, 
he said, with an unconvincing 
smile, "Lots of work here, you 
know. I'm days behind." 

Baley regarded him thoughtfully. "I tell you what. then. 
Why not get into it by trimension later on? Just for a while, 
you understand. In case I need 
help." 

"Well, yes. I suppose I can do 
that." He sounded unenthusiastic. 

"Good." Baley glanced at the 
wall-clock, nodded, and got up. 
"I'll be in touch with you." 

Baley looked back as he left 



56 




 



the office, keeping the door open 
for part of an additional second. 
He saw the Commissioner's head 
begin bending down toward the 
crook of one elbow as it rested 
on the desk. The plainclothesman 
could almost swear he heard a 
sob. 

Jehoshaphat! he thought, in 
outright shock. 

He paused in the common 
room and sat on the corner of a 
nearby desk, ignoring its occupant, who looked up, murmured 
a casual greeting, and returned 
to his work. 

Baley undipped the baffle 
from the bowl of the pipe and 
blew into it. He inverted the 
pipe itself over the desk's small 
ash-vacuum and let the powdery-white tobacco ash vanish. 
He looked regretfully at the 
empty pipe, readjusted the baffle, 
and put it away. Another pipeful 
gone forever. 

He reconsidered what had just 
taken place. In one way, Enderby 
had not surprised him. He had 
expected resistance to any attempt on his own part to enter 
Spacetown. He had heard the 
Commissioner talk often enough 
about the difficulties of dealing 
with Spacers, about the dangers 
of allowing any but experienced 
negotiators to have anything to 
do with them, even over trifles. 

He had not expected, however, 
to have the Commissioner give 



in so easily. He had supposed, at 
the very least,- that Enderby 
would have insisted on accompanying him. The pressure of 
other work was meaningless in 
the face of the importance of this 
problem. 

And that was not what Baley 
wanted. He wanted exactly what 
he got. He wanted the Commissioner to be present by trimensional personification so that he 
could witness the proceedings 
from a place of safety*. 

SAFETY was the keyword. 
Baley would need a witness 
who could not be put out of the 
way immediately. He needed that 
as the minimum guarantee of his 
own safety. 

The Commissioner had agreed 
to it at once. Baley remembered 
the parting sob, or ghost of one, 
and thought: Jehoshaphat, the 
man's into this beyond his depth. 

A cheerful, slurring voice 
sounded just at Baley's shoulder, 
and Baley started. 

"What the devil do you want?" 
he demanded. 

The smile on R. Sammy's face 
remained foolishly fixed. "Jack 
says to tell you Daneel is ready, 
Lije." 

"All right. Now get out of 

here." 

He frowned at the robot's departing back. There was nothing 
so irritating as having that 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



57 



clumsy metal contraption forever 
making free with his front name. 
He'd complained about that when 
R. Sammy first arrived and the 
Commissioner had shrugged his 
shoulders and said, "You can't 
have it both ways, Lije. The 
public insists that City robots be 
built with a strong friendship 
circuit. All right, then. He is 
drawn to you. He calls you by 
the friendliest name he knows." 
Friendship circuit! No robot 



built, of any type, could possibly hurt a human being. That 
was the First Law of Robotics: 
"A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, 
allow a human being to come to 
harm." 

No positronic brain was ever 
built without that injunction 
driven so deeply into its basic 
circuits that no conceivable derangement could displace it. 
There was no need for special


58 




 



ized friendship circuits. 

Yet the Commissioner was 
right. The Earthman's fear and 
resentment of robots were so deep 
and so justified that friendship 
circuits had to be incorporated, 
just as all robots had to be made 
smiling. On Earth, at any rate. 
- R. Daneel, though, never 
smiled. 

Sighing, Baley rose to his feet. 
He thought: Spacetown, next 
stop. Or, maybe, last stop. 

rjiHE police forces of the City, 
-■■ as well as certain high officials, could still make use of individual squad-cars along the 
corridors of the City and even 
along the ancient underground 
motorways that were barred to 
foot-traffic. There were perennial 
demands by the Medievalists that 
these motorways be converted to 
children's playgrounds, to new 
shopping areas or to Expressway 
or Localway extensions. 

The strong pleas of "Civic 
Safety" remained unvanquished, 
however. In cases of fires too large 
to be handled by local devices; 
in cases of massive breakdowns 
in power lines or ventilators; 
most of all in cases of serious 
riot, there had to be some means 
whereby the forces of the City 
could be mobilized at the stricken 
point in a hurry. No substitute 
for the motorways existed or 
could exist. 



Baley had traveled along a 
motorway several times before 
in his life, but its indecent emptiness always depressed him. It 
seemed a million miles from the 
warm , living pulsation of the 
City. It stretched out like a 
blind and hollow worm before his 
eyes as he sat at the controls of 
the squad-car. It opened continuously into new stretches as he 
moved around this gentle curve 
or that. Behind him, he knew 
without looking, another blind 
and hollow worm continually 
contracted and closed. The motorway was well -lit, but lighting 
was meaningless in the silence 
and emptiness. 

R. Daneel did nothing to break 
that silence or fill that emptiness. He looked straight ahead, 
as unimpressed by the empty 
motorway as by the bulging Expressway. 

In one sounding moment, to 
the tune of a wild whine of the 
squad-car's siren, they popped 
out of the motorway and curved 
gradually into the vehicular lane 
of a City corridor. 

The vehicular lanes were still 
conscientiously marked down 
each major corridor in reverence 
for one vestigial portion of the 
past. There were no vehicles any 
longer except for squad-cars, and 
pedestrians used the lanes in complete self-assurance. They scattered in indignant hurry before 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



59 



the rush of Baley's squealing car. 

Baley himself drew a freer 
breath as noise surged in about 
him, but it was an interval only. 
They turned into the subdued 
corridors that led to Spacetown 
Entrance. 

"VTATURALLY, they were ex' pected. The guards obviously knew R. Daneel by sight and, 
although themselves human, 
nodded to him without the least 
self -consciousness or condescension. 

One approached Baley and 
saluted with perfect, if frigid, 
military courtesy. He was tall 
and grave, though not the perfect specimen of Spacer physique 
that R. Daneel was. 

He said, "Your identification 
card, if you please, sir." 

It was inspected quickly but 
thoroughly. Baley noticed that 
the guard wore flesh -colored 
gloves and had an all-but-unnoticeable filter in each nostril. 

The guard saluted again and 
returned the card. He said, 
"There is a Men's Personal here 
which we would be pleased to 
have you use to shower." 

.Baley was about to deny the 
necessity, but as the guard stepped back to his place, R. Daneel 
said, "It is customary, Partner 
Elijah, for City-dwellers to shower before entering Spacetown. I 
tell you this since I know you 



have no desire, through lack of 
information on this matter, to 
render yourself or ourselves uncomfortable. It is also advisable 
for you to attend to any matters 
of personal hygiene you may 
think advisable. There will be no 
facilities within Spacetown for 
that purpose." 

"No facilities? That's impossible? 

• "I mean, of course," said R. 
Daneel, "none for use by Citydwellers." 

Baley's face filled with a clearly hostile astonishment. 

R, Daneel said, "I regret the 
situation, but it is a matter of 
custom." 

Wordlessly, Baley entered the 
Personal. He felt, rather than 
saw, R. Daneel entering behind 
him. 

He thought: Checking on me? 
Making sure I wash the alleged 
City filth off myself? 

For a furious moment, he reveled in the thought of the shock 
he was preparing fpr Spacetown. 
It seemed to him suddenly unimportant that he might, in effect, 
be pointing a blaster at his own 
chest. 

The Personal was small, but it 
was well appointed and antiseptjc 
in its cleanliness. There was a 
trace of sharpness in the air. 
Baley sniffed at it, momentarily 
puzzled. 

Then he thought: Ozone! 



60 




 



They've got ultra-violet radiation 
flooding the place, 

A little sign blinked on and 
off several times, then remained 
steadily lit. It said, "Visitor Will 
Please Remove All Clothing, Including Shoes, and Place It in the 
Receptacle Below." 

Baley obeyed. He unhitched his 
blaster and blaster-strap and recircled it about his naked waist. 
It felt heavy and uncomfortable. 

The receptacle closed and his 
clothing was gone. The lighted 
sign blanked out. A new sign 
flashed ahead. 

It said: "Visitor Will Please 
Tend to Personal Needs, then 
Make Use of the Shower Indicated by Arrow." 

Baley felt like a machine-tool 
being shaped by long-distance 
force-edges on an assembly line. 

TTIS first act upon entering the 
small shower cubicle was to 
draw up the moistureproof flap 
on his blaster holster and slip it 
down firmly. He knew by repeated test that he could still 
draw and fire it in less than five 
seconds. 

There was no knob or hook 
on which to hang his blaster. 
There was not even a visible 
shower head. He placed the 
weapon in a corner away from 
the cubicle's entrance door. 

Another sign flashed: "Visitor 
Will Please Hold Arms Directly 



Out from His Body and Stand in 
the Central Circle with Feet in 
the Indicated Positions." 

As he placed his feet in the 
small depressions allowed for 
them, the sign blanked out. A 
stinging, foaming spray hit him 
from ceiling, floor and four walls. 
He felt the water welling up even 
beneath the soles of his feet. For 
a full minute it lasted, his skin 
reddening under the combined 
force of the heat and pressure 
and his lungs gasping for air in 
the warm dampness. There followed another minute of cool, 
low-pressure spray, and then 
finally a current of warm air that 
left him dry and refreshed. 

He picked up his blaster and 
blaster-strap and found that they, 
too. were dry and warm. He put 
them on and stepped out of the 
cubicle in time to see R. Daneel 
emerge from a neighboring 
shower. Of course! R. Daneel was 
not a City-dweller, but he had 
accumulated City dust. 

Quite automatically, Baley 
looked away. Then with the 
thought that, after all, R. 
Daneel's customs were not City 
customs, he forced his unwilling 
eyes back for one moment. His 
lips quirked in a tiny smile. R. 
Daneel's resemblance to humanity was not restricted to his face 
and hands, but had been carried 
out with painstaking accuracy 
over the entire body. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



61 



Baley stepped forward in the 
direction he had been traveling 
continuously since entering the 
Personal. He found his clothes 
waiting for him, neatly folded. 
They had a warm, clean odor. 

A sign said, "Visitor Will 
Please Resume His Clothing and 
Place His Hand in the Indicated 
Depression." 

Baley did so. He felt a definite 
tingling in the ball of his middle 
finger as he laid it down upon the 
clean, milky surface. He lifted his 
hand hastily and found a little 
drop of blood oozing out. As he 
watched it, it stopped flowing. 

He shook it off and pinched the 
finger. No more blood was flowing even then. 

Obviously, they were analyzing 
his blood. He felt a surge of 
anxiety. His own yearly routine 
examination by Department doctors, he felt sure, was not carried 
on with the thoroughness or, perhaps, with the knowledge of these 
cold, robot-makers from outer 
space. He was not sure he wanted 
too probing an inquiry into the 
state of his health. 

The time of waiting seemed 
long to Baley, but when the light 
flashed again, it said simply, 
"Visitor Will Proceed." 

Baley drew a long breath of 
relief. He walked onward and 
stepped through an archway. 
Two metal rods closed in before 
him and, written in luminous air. 



were the words: "Visitor is 
Warned to Proceed no Farther." 

"What the devil — " called out 
Baley, forgetting in his anger the 
fact that he was still in the Personal. 

RDANEEL'S voice was in 
• his ear. "The sniffers have 
detected a power source, I imagine. Are you carrying your blaster, Elijah?" 

Baley whirled, his face a deep 
crimson. He tried twice, then 
managed to croak out, "A police 
officer has his blaster on him or 
in easy reach at all times." 

It was the first time he had 
spoken in a Personal, proper, 
since he was ten years old. That 
had been in his Uncle Boris's 
presence and had merely been 
an automatic complaint when he 
stubbed his toe. Uncle Boris had 
slapped him hard when he reached home and had lectured him 
strongly on public decency. 

R. Daneel said, "No visitor 
may be armed. It is our custom, 
Elijah. Even your Commissioner 
leaves his blaster behind on all 
visits." 

Under almost any other circumstances, Baley would have 
walked away, away from Spacetown and away from that robot. 
Now, however, he'd been given 
additional goads to go through 
with his plan and have his revenge. 




 



In black anger, Baley unhitched his blaster belt. R. Daneel took 
it from him and placed it within 
a recess in the wall. A thin metal 
plate slithered across it. 

"If you will put your thumb in 
the depression," said R. Daneel, 
"only your thumb will open it 
later on." 

Baley felt undressed, far more 
so, in fact, than he had felt in 
the shower. He stepped across the 
point at which the rods had 
barred him, and, finally, out the 
Personal. 

He was back in a corridor 
again, but there was an element 
of strangeness about it. Up ahead, 
the light had an unfamiliar quality to it. He felt a whiff of air 
against his face. Automatically, 
he thought a squad-car had 
passed. 

R. Daneel must have read his 
uneasiness in his face. He said, 
"You are in open air now, Elijah. 
It is unconditioned." 

Baley felt faintly sick. How 
could the Spacers be so rigidly 
careful of a human body, merely 
because it came from the City, 
and then breathe the dirty air of 
the open fields? He tightened his 
nostrils, as though by pulling 
them together he could more 
effectively screen the ingoing air. 

R, Daneel said, "I believe you 
will find the open air is not 
deleterious to human health." 

"All right," said Baley faintly. 



The air currents hit queasily 
against his face. They were gentle 
enough, but they were erratic. 
That bothered him. 

Worse came. The corridor 
opened into blueness and as they 
approached its end, strong white 
light washed down. Baley had 
seen sunlight. He had been in a 
natural Solarium once in the line 
of duty. But protecting glass had 
enclosed the place and the Sun's 
own image had been refracted 
into a generalized glow. Here, all 
was open. 

A Spacer was approaching. A 
tiny moment of terror struck 
Baley. 

R. Daneel, however, stepped 
forward to greet the approaching 
man with a handshake. The 
Spacer turned to Baley and said, 
"Won't you come with me, sir? 
I am Dr. Han Fastolfe." 

TT was better inside one of the 
domes. Baley found himself 
goggling at the si2e of the rooms 
and the way in which space was 
so carelessly distributed, but was 
thankful for the feel of the conditioned air. 

Fastolfe said, sitting down and 
crossing his long legs, "I'm assuming that you prefer air-conditioning to unobstructed wind." 

He seemed friendly enough. 
There were fine wrinkles on his 
forehead and a certain flabbiness 
to the skin below his eyes and

just under his chin. His hair was 
thinning, but showed no signs of 
gray. His large ears stood away 
from his head, giving him a humorous and homely appearance 
that comforted Baley. 

Early that morning, Baley had 
looked once again at those pictures of Spacetown that Enderby 
had taken. R. Daneel had just 
arranged the Spacetown appointment and Baley was absorbing 
the notion that he was to meet 
Spacers in the flesh. Somehow 
that was considerably different 
from speaking to them across 
miles of carrier wave, as he had 
done on several occasions before. 

The Spacers in those pictures 
had been, generally speaking, like 
those that were occasionally featured in the book-films: tall, 
grave, coldly handsome. Like R. 
Daneel Olivaw, for instance. 

R. Daneel had named the 
Spacers for Baley and when 
Baley suddenly pointed and said, 
in surprise, "That isn't you, is it?" 
R. Daneel unemotionally answered, **No, Elijah, that was my 
designer, Dr. Sarton, the one who 
was murdered." 

"You were made in your maker's image?" asked Baley sardonically, but there was no answer 
to that and Baley scarcely expected one. A robot wouldn't 
know anything about the Bible. 

And now Baley looked at Han 
Fastolfe, a man who deviated 

64 < 



noticeably from the Spacer norm 
in looks, and the Earthman felt 
gratitude for that fact 

"Won't you accept food?" 
asked Fastolfe. 

He indicated the table that 
separated himself and R. Daneel 
from the Earthman. It bore nothing but a bowl of van-colored 
spheroids- Baley felt vaguely 
startled. He had taken them for 
table decorations. 

R. Daneel explained, "These 
are the fruits of natural plantlife grown on Aurora. I suggest 
you try this kind. It is called an 
apple and is reputed to be tasty." 

Fastolfe smiled. "R. Daneel 
does not know this by personal 
experience, of course, but he is 
quite right." 

TJALEY brought an apple to 
" his mouth. Its surface was red 
and green. It was cool to the 
touch and had a faint but pleasant odor. With an effort, he bit 
into it and the unexpected tartness hurt his teeth. 

He chewed it gingerly. City' dwellers ate natural food, of 
course, whenever rations allowed 
it. He himself had eaten real 
meat and bread several times. 
But such food had always been 
processed in some way. It had 
been cooked or ground, blended 
or compounded. Fruit, now, propt erly speaking, should come in the 
1 form of sauce or preserve. What 


 



he was holding must have come 
straight from the dirt of a planet's 
soil. 

He thought: I hope they've 
washed it, at least. And again he 
wondered at the spottiness of 
Spacer notions about cleanliness. 

Fastolfe said, "Let me introduce myself a bit more specifically. I am in charge of the 
investigation of the murder of Dr. 
Sarton at the Spacetown end as 
Commissioner Enderby is at the 
City end. If I can help you in 
any way, I stand ready to do so. 
We are as eager for a quiet solution of the affair and prevention 
of future incidents of this sort as 
any of you City men can be." 

"Thank you, Dr. Fastolfe," 
said Baley. "Your attitude is appreciated." 

So much, he thought, for the 
amenities. He bit into the center 
of the apple and hard, dark little 
ovoids popped into his mouth. 
He spat automatically. They flew 
out and fell to the ground. One 
would have struck Fastolfe's leg 
had not the Spacer moved it 
hastily. 

Baley reddened, started to 
bend. 

Fastolfe said, pleasantly, "It is 
quite all right, Mr. Baley. Just 
leave them, please." 

Baley straightened again. He 
put the apple down gingerly. He 
had the uncomfortable feeling 
that once he was gone, the lost 



little objects would be found and 
picked up by suction; the bowl 
of fruit would be burned or discarded far from Spacetown; the 
very room they were sitting in 
would be sprayed with viricide. 

He covered his embarrassment 
with brusqueness. He said, "I 
would like to ask permission to 
have Commissioner Enderby join 
our conference by trimensional 
personification." 

Fastolfe's eyebrows raised. 
"Certainly, if you wish it. Daneel, 
would you make the connection?" 

TN stiff discomfort, Baley waited 
■*■ until the shiny surface of the 
large parallelopiped in one corner 
of the room dissolved away to 
show Commissioner Julius Enderby and part of his desk. At 
that moment, the discomfort 
eased and Baley felt nothing 
short of love for that familiar 
figure, and a nostalgic longing 
to be safely back in that office 
with him, or anywhere in the 
City, for that matter — even in 
the least prepossessing portion 
of the Jersey yeast vat districts. 

Now that he had his witness, 
Baley saw no reason for delay. 
He said, "I believe I have penetrated the mystery surrounding 
the death of Dr. Sarton." 

Out of the corner of his eyes, 
he saw Enderby springing to his 
feet and grabbing wildly (and 
successfully) at his flying spec

tacles. By standing, the Commissioner thrust his head out of the 
limits of the trimensic receiver 
and was forced to sit down again, 
red-faced and speechless. 

In a much quieter way, Dr. 
Fastolfe, head inclined to one 
side, was as startled. Only R. 
Daneel remained unmoved. 

"Do you mean," said Fastolfe, 
"that you know who the murderer is?" 

"No," Baley replied. "I mean 
there was no murder." 

"What?" yelped Enderby. 

"One moment, Commissioner 



Enderby," said Fastolfe, raising 
a hand. His eyes held Baley's and 
he asked in a tensely quiet voice, 
"Do you mean that Dr. Sarton 
is alive?" 

"That's exactly what I mean. 
And I believe I know where he 
is." 

Enderby's slack mouth silently 
formed the word, but it was 
Fastolfe who said it: 

"Where?" 

"Right there," said Baley. 
He pointed straight at R. 
Daneel Olivaw.
