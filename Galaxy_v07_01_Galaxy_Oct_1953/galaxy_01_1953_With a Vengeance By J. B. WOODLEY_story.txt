With a Vengeance By J. B. WOODLEY

TODAY, at precisely 9:50 
a.m., Kyle became First 
Imperator of Terra. His 
coup was so fantastically direct 



and facile that. I am almost 
tempted to believe that old cliche 
"the time was right." 

Well, however badly it can be 
expressed, I suppose the world 
was ripe for this sort of thing. I 



WITH A VENGEANCE

can remember when much the 
same used to happen in elections. 
One man would win over another 
by a tremendous majority, and 
historians would then set about 
to show how "the time was right." 

Why do I persist in tormenting 
myself with that phrase! Analytically, I might say I resent this 
new aristocracy of politics. Specifically, I might say I resent 
Kyle. 

And both are true, both are 
true. 

This swing, though, to absolute 
monarchy, complete with the installation of the Kyle Dynasty — 
damn him ! This is something 
which psychologists, not historians, must explain. Has the age 
of the Common Man, so bravely 
flaunted for over one hundred 
years, truly come to nothing? 
Would people really prefer a figurehead and a symbol of undisputed authority? 

In this instance, one may again 
conclude that "the time was 
right." Contact with planets like 
Mars and Venus undoubtedly had 
its influence. I must confess that 
the televised audiences with the 
Mrit of Venus and the Znam of 
Mars cfio* make Terra's President 
— I should say, late President — 
look a bit seedy. I daresay there 
is such a thing as a too common 
Common Man. 

Kyle was such, twenty years 
ago. His name wasn't Kyle then, 



although it was something very 
like that. I must see if any of the 
old ledgers are about! I'd like to 
see what the Imperator's name 
was when His Most Imperial 
Majesty was an apprenticed nobody!

T FOUND it! Buried in stacks 
of dust behind the old printing press that was once the heart 
of my Beacon-Sentinel. There 
were others there too, Spent a 
delightful morning with them, 
reading back through those old 
account books. 

I wonder whatever happened to 
Hastings? And Drew? Best linotype men I ever had. They became pilots, or something, as I 
recall. Too bad, too bad. They 
could have had such brilliant 
futures, both of them. Why they 
felt they must ally themselves 
with the non-thinking, muscleflexing variety of mankind — of 
which our Ruler is an excellent 
example — I'll never know. 

Ah, yes, Kyle! In those days 
he was Kilmer Jones. I don't remember him too well, actually, 
except for the day I fired him. 

I suppose he was right in 
changing his name. We couldn't 
very well have an Imperator 
named Kilmer the First, or Jones 
the First. Much too common, not 
at all in keeping. 



no 




 



Gawky fellow — that Kilmer. 
When Bard brought me a sample 
of his work — I guess I'll have to 
call it that — we both had a good 
laugh over it! Atrocious spelling! 
Couldn't follow the proofreader's 
marks. Indeed, I wonder if the 
fellow could even read! The 
punctuation! And the grammar! 

I called the boy to the office 
that morning — or was it the next 
day? No matter. I called him in 
and told him, as kindly as possible, that I thought there were 
other vocations to which he might 
be better suited. The irony of it! 
Kilmer Jones — Kyle I! 

And he stood there, I remember, with those seventeen-yearold hands that were all knuckles 
and bone and chapped skin, 
twisting those hands and shifting 
his weight from one foot to the 
other. 

"Please, Mr. Booth," he said, 
his voice cracking. "I ain't got no 
other job in mind. I wanna be a 
noospaper man. I ain't got no — " 

If not for that "ain't got no," I 
think I might have relented. But 
no one is going to ruin the English language as he did! Not in 
my offices! 

I took him to task severely for 
his offensive usage, outlined a 
correct example of what he had 
attempted to say, gave him a 
brief lesson in the history of the 
tongue, and explained why it had 
been chosen as the official Terran 



speech. I think my conclusion 
was, "You'll be much better off 
in a position which requires you 
to quote neither Milton nor 
Shakespeare nor any author save 
possibly those who write the 
comic strips." 

"Got no training," he said 
softly. (I supposed it was to keep 
his voice from exhibiting its 
usual adolescent gymnastics.) 

I shuddered slightly, I remember. "You mean, 'I have no training.' " 

"Yeah . . ." softly again. "Yeah, 
Mr. Booth." 

"Yes!" I cried impatiently. 
"Not 'y ea n.' but yes!" 

I searched for his severance pay 
on my desk, wondering who the 
devil had hired him in the first 
place. Gave him three weeks pay, 
as I recall it, one more than 
necessary. 

Unmannerly pup! He just stood 
there for a minute and then finally left without even a "Thank 
you," or "Good-by." 

And this is the man who is 
Kyle the First, Ruler of Terra at 
the age of thirty -seven! I wonder 
what he is like now . . .

rpHERE is no longer any need 
to wonder. Surprisingly few 
heads have rolled, but apparently 
Jonesy chooses to exhibit his 
power in other ways. 



WITH A VENGEANCE 



Thanksgiving Day, a custom 
preserved in certain portions of 
the Directorate of North America, is three weeks away — even 
though it is January. 

The Year One. There used to 
be some childish joke about the 
Year One, Don't remember it just 
now. 

Thanksgiving harvest in January. Christmas celebration in 
February. Spring planting in 
July! To say nothing of the inconvenience this -has caused in 
my bookkeeping department! I 
suppose the man will now try to 
change the weather to suit his 
new calendar! 

January 8, 1 
New San Francisco 
He can't last! He can't! A dictator is one thing. A monarch is 
another. But Kyle is something 
else! 

Naturally he had to remove 
certain persons from his way. And 
his summer palace in the plains 
region of America — that's all 
right, that's all right! An authority of Kyle's stature is expected to remove undesirables, 
and to have a summer palace, 
and a winter palace, and anything else he wants! Of course! 

But why this? Why this of all 
things! 

No newspapers! Just like that! 
He waves an edict, and just like 
that, no newspapers.' The Beacon


Sentinel has been a great paper 
for the last twenty-five years! It 
was nothing, and I was nothing, 
and together we became a Voice! 
And now again, we are nothing! 

Oh, I see what's behind it! It's 
revenge, that's what it is! Because he once couldn't become a 
"noospaper" man, he's taking his 
vengeance this way. 

A man as petty as that shall 
be overthrown! Mark my words! 
And the clumsiness of it! 

I see what he is! I know him! 
He's still that pup of seventeen, 
playing king with the world, 
twisting his hands in glee over his 
childish triumph. 

No subtlety ! Just a direct 
pushing over an applecart he 
couldn't steer ! Doesn't matter 
whose apples you destroy, does 
it, Jonesy? Just push it over — 
push it over!

Closed the Beacon-Sentinel 
yesterday. My savings are enough 
to take care of me for a few 
years. After that — ah, well, I am 
no longer a young man. I am 
glad that Elsa is not here to see 
this.

RECEIVED a letter this morning, requesting me to appear 
at the chambers of His Most 



112 




 



Imperial Majesty, Kyle the First, 
on Tuesday of next week. His 
Most Imperial Majesty can see 
me between 10:15 and 10:25 on 
that morning. 

Ten minutes — rather a brief 
spell in which to roll another 
head. 

I find myself amazed, though. 
Is this man so truly powerful 
that he needs no police to make 
his arrests for him? Can he really 
send messages via jetmail and be 
certain his enemies will not try 
to escape? 

I don't want to attempt flight 
Life without my work is no longer 
life. 

February 17, 1 

Kyleton Palace, North America 
T DON'T understand. I've gone 
over it twice, and I don't 
understand. If only Elsa were 
still with me! I could talk to her. 
She would help me decipher what 
it's all about. 

This morning, at 10:15 sharp, 
I was taken to the public audience chamber in the palace. 

His Majesty was seated behind a desk facing the doors. Behind him, on the wall, was His 
Coat of Arms. 

He stood up and walked toward me, waving away the 
guards. "How are you, Mr. 
Booth?" he said. And offered me 
His Hand! 

I recovered my presence of 



mind, of course, and replied as 
was fitting. 

And then He said it! "I shall 
be at liberty later this week to 
discuss more fully the details of 
these past years." (Shades of 
"ain't got no!") "Meanwhile, my 
secretary will give you a complete dossier on my planned Official Bulletin." He lighted a cigarette after offering me one. "I 
should deem it an honor," he continued, "to have a man of your 
literary versatility and — I must 
add — your vast practical experience become Chief Editor of that 
Bulletin. The publication, which 
I should enjoy christening The 
Terran Beacon-Sentinel — with 
your permission, sir — shall be 
more than my official organ. It 
shall set the standards for the 
coming newspaper world." 

He cocked an eyebrow at me 
and smiled. "I believe we are in 
perfect accord about certain 
standards, are we not, Mr. 
Booth? The deplorable grammatical practices of some newspapers! Well, really, Mr. Booth! I 
feel assured of your agreement!" 

He led me around the desk and 
pointed to the Coat of Arms. As 
He stood silent, I felt obliged to 
look more closely. I had seen it 
before, of course, but seeing it 
now, greatly enlarged, I was able 
to make out its detail. 

What I had thought was a mere 
decorative border, I now realized 



WITH A VENGEANCE 



113 



was a motif I have seen all my 
life! A tiny lighthouse sending 
forth a beam! The trademark of 
my paper! 

As I stood there, gaping, His 
Majesty laughed softly and said, 
"That, Mr. Booth, I felt impelled 
to include. For, without your 
most fortuitous termination of 
my apprenticeship in your organization, I should not have 
risen to my present position." 

A GAIN He took my hand and 
shook it, warmly. His hair is 
just a bit gray at the temples, and 
there are signs of strain on His 
finely featured face. Those awkward hands are now strong and 
purposeful. 

He apologized that He must return to His duties, and went with 
me to the door. "My secretary will 
fill in further details about your 
new position. Newspapers shall 
once again be published. No — 
don't say a word, Mr. Booth! I 
know what you are thinking. 

"Your salary," he continued as 
we stood at the open door, "shall, 
of course, be commensurate to 
your high authority in this new 
field. Allow me, now, to thank 
you most deeply and sincerely 
for your unwitting aid in my 
youth. I assure you, Mr. Booth, 
I have often thought of that day 
we talked. And I hope to repay 
you, in some measure, for what 
you did." 



He said more, mostly polite 
phrases of good-by. And then I 
was outside after being handed a 
folder by some man. 

An official jetmobile took me 
to my residence — which turned 
out to be in the East Wing. Here 
I am, and I don't understand. I 
came prepared to suffer heaven 
only knows what as part of Kilmer Jones's childish pattern for 
revenge. 

Instead, here I am, head of the 
Official Bulletin, titular ruler and 
ruler-in-fact of the future journalism of the world! 

There is something behind this 
— I keep feeling there is. But 
what? What? Or is he truly generous, to a degree never before 
known among absolute monarchs? 

February 13, 1 
Kyleton Palace, North America 
T AM a suspicious and most 
humble old man. I see now 
that Kyle's generosity amazed 
me only because I myself would 
have been incapable of such an 
action. 

Just now, I fear for His Majesty. I was right, before, when 
I said there was no subtlety in 
the man. He is too open, too fair, 
too forgiving. A ruler with such 
greatness of heart might easily 
allow some small insignificant 
person in too far, too close. I fear 
for him!

February 14, 1 
Kyleton Palace, North America 
Tomorrow we begin publication! The pressroom is magnificent! I can hardly wait. It's been 
a long time since I've felt such 
exuberance. 

This afternoon I am to conduct a conference of some eight 
hundred editors! His Majesty's 
secretary has sent me an outline 
on Journalistic Standards, which 
I shall study after lunch. 

There was a. note attached, in 
His Majesty's handwriting — such 
beautiful penmanship, too, "A 
mere formality," it said, "for, of 
course, you and I know full well 
what the future of journalism 
shall be, Mr. Booth." 

Later — 

How wrong can one man be 
in one lifetime? 

I wonder now why he changed 
the calendar. I wonder now what 
poor devil he destroyed then. But 
/'// cheat him! 

I'll cheat him yet!
