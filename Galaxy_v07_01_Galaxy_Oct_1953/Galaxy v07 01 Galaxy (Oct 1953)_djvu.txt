*T>HERE ARE some things that caa not be generally told — things you 
J. ought to Jtnow. Great truths are dangerous to some— but factors lor 
personal power and accomplishment in the hands of those who understand them. Behind the tales of the miracles and mysteries of the 
ancients, lie centuries of their secret probing into nature's laws-thai t 
amazing discoveries of the hidden processes of man's mind, and the 
mastery of life's problems. Once shrouded in mystery to avoid their 
destruction by mass fear and ignorance, these facts remain a useful 
heritage for the thousands of men and women who privately use them 
in their homes today.

i How I foxed 

I the Navy 

: by Arthur Oodfreg 



The Navy almost scuttled me. I shudder lo 
think of it. My crazy career could have ended 
right i here. Who knows, I might si i II be bumming Chesterfields instead of selling them. 

To be scuttled by the Navy you've either 
got to do something wrong or neglect to do 
something right. They've got you both ways. 
For my part, I neglected to finish high school. 

Ordinarily, a man can get along without a 
high school diploma. Plenty of men have. Bnt 
not in the Navy. At least not in the TJ. S. Navy 
Materiel School ai Bellevue, D. C_ bark in 
1929. In those days a bluejacket had to have 
■ mind like Einstein's. And I didn't. 

"Godfrey," said the lieutenant a few days 
after I'd checked in, "either you learn mat hemittics and learn it fast or out you go. I'll give 
you nix weeks." This, I figured, was it. For a 
guy who had to lake off his shoes to count

I was ready to turn in my bell bottoms. But 
an ad in a magazine stopped me. Here, it said, 
ii your chance lo get special training in almost 
any subject— ma I he ma tics included. I hopped 
on it. Within a week I was enrolled with the 
International Correspondence Schools studying 
algebra, geometry' and trig for all 1 was worth. 

Came week-end liberty, I studied. Came a 
holiday, I studied. Came the end of the six 
weeks, I was lop man in the class. Within 
six weeks I had mastered two years of high 
school math, ibanks to the training I'd gotten.

70 THE HILLS! 



Tl/JANY alleged alarmists, such 
as Charles Fort, have insisted that Earth has been visited 
by aliens from space. If their evidence weren't so unremittingly 
spectacular, they would have 
seen the truth: 

Earth is being invaded now! 

No giant ships are raining 
death-rays from the sky, no land 
ironclads flattening our cities and 
laying waste the countryside. 

That's the truly devilish part 
of the invasion — it's a sneak attack, utterly silent and unnoticeable. While the stormy petrels of 
science are pointing out vast footsteps and the craters of crashed 
ships, the weapons of conquest 
are in your home. 

The clues are outwardly so insignificant that only a squinting 
eye and a suspicious mind can 
detect them, let alone guess their 
sinister meaning. 

Let's piece the data together 
calmly, without panic. It may 
not be as evil as it seems, but I 
doubt that. 

As a child, did you or did you 
not have more marbles, jacks, 
tops and checkers than you ever 
bought? 

Of course you did, and so did 
every other child you knew. 

That doesn't sound like much 
to get excited about, which is ex


actly why the plot is more deadly than outright assault: 

The invasion weapons are purposely ordinary to keep us from 
becoming aware of the danger. 

Use this checklist. It is admittedly incomplete. No doubt you 
can add many more. 

• When GALAXY was born, we 
purchased a box of 100 paper 
clips. We have not bought a single one since. A special case, you 
may say — they're sent in with 
manuscripts. Well, then, answer 
this: Whenever you needed a paper clip, have you ever failed to 
find one somewhere or other? 

• If you can't locate a rubber 
band, yours is an exceptional 
home — and yet when, if ever, did 
you buy any? 

• Is it or is it not a fact that you 
can always haul out a piece of 
string from drawer or toolbox? 
Did you buy it at a store or just 
accumulate it? 

• Do you or do you not have a 
collection of pencils, of which 
you bought none or very few? 

• How many clothes hangers 
did you yourself buy? 

• Wrapping and tissue paper? 

• Mucilage, glue, paste? 

• Nails, screws, toothpicks? 
These are the deceptively innocent ingredients of the plot to

dered irritably why those duties 
couldn't be done by a man, 

He paused to examine the contents of his tobacco pouch and 
made a mental calculation. At 
two pipefuls a day, he could 
stretch it to next quota day. 

Then Baley stepped out from 
behind his railing — he'd earned a 
railed corner two years ago — and 
walked the length of the common 
room. 

Simpson looked up from a 
mere-pool file as he passed. 
"Boss wants you, Lije." 

"I know. R. Sammy told me." 

A closely coded tape reeled out 
of the mere-pool's vitals as the 
small instrument searched and 
analyzed its "memory" for the 
desired information, which was 
stored in the tiny vibration patterns of the gleaming mercury 
surface within. 

"I'd kick R. Sammy's armored 
behind if I weren't afraid of 
breaking a leg," said Simpson. "I 
saw Yi nc e Barrett the other day." 

Baley's long face grew longer. 
"How's he doing?" 

"Working a deli very -tread on 
the yeast farms. He asked if there 
was any chance he could get his 
job back. Qr any job in the Department. What could I tell him? 
R. Sammy's doing Vince's job 
now and that's that. A damned 
shame. Vince is a bright kid. 
Everyone liked him." 

Baley shrugged. "It's some


thing we're all living through," he 
said in a manner stiffer than he 
intended or felt. He'd liked Vince, 
too, and hated the vacantly grinning robot that had replaced the 
boy. His own foot had itched in 
much the same fashion as Simpson's. Not just for R. Sammy, 
either. For any of the damned 
robots. 

THE boss rated a private office. It said JULIUS ENDERBY on the clouded glass. Nice 
letters, but individually removable. The rest underneath, "Commissioner of Police, City of New 
York," was carefully etched into 
the glass. The jobs were permanent; the job-holders were not. 
And with robots taking over more 
and more human occupations — 
Baley stepped into the office 
and said, "You want to see me, 
Commissioner?" 

Enderby looked up. He wore 
spectacles because his eyes were 
sensitive and couldn't take the 
usual contact lenses. It was only 
after one got used to the sight 
of them that one could take in the 
rest of the face, which was quite 
undistinguished. Baley had a 
strong notion that the Commissioner valued his glasses for the 
personality they lent him and 
suspected that his eyeballs 
weren't as sensitive as all that. 

The Commissioner looked definitely nervous. He straightened 



6 




 



his cuffs, leaned back, and said, 
too heartily, "Sit down, Lije. Sit 
down." 

Baley sat down stiffly and 
waited. 

Enderby said, "How's Jessie 
and the boy?" 

"Fine," said Baley hollowly. 
"Just fine. And your family?" 

"Fine," echoed Enderby. "Just 
fine." 

It had been a false start. 

Baley thought: Something's 
wrong with his face. 

He said, "Commissioner, I wish 
you wouldn't send R. Sammy out 
after me." 

"Well, you know how I feel 
about those things, Lije. But he's 
been put here and I've got to use 
him for something." 
. "It's uncomfortable, Commissioner. He tells me you want me 
and then he stands there. I have 
to tell him to go or he just keeps 
on standing there." 

"Oh, that's my fault, Lije. I 
gave him the message to deliver 
and forgot to tell him specifically 
to get back to his job when he 
was through." 

Baley sighed. The fine wrinkles 
about his intensely brown eyes 
grew more pronounced. "Anyway 
you wanted to see me." 

"Yes, Lije," said the Commissioner, "but not for anything 
easy.'* 

He stood up, turned away, and 
walked to the wall behind his 



desk. He touched an inconspicuous contact -switch and a section of the wall grew transparent. 

Baley blinked at the unexpected insurge of grayish light. 

The Commissioner smiled. "I 
had this specially arranged last 
year, Lije. I don't think I've 
shown it to you before. Come 
over here and take a look. In the 
old days, all rooms had things 
like this. They were called 'windows.' Did you know that?" 

"I've heard of them," Baley 
said. He had viewed many historical novels. 

"Come here." 

Baley squirmed, but did as he 
was told. There was something 
indecent about exposing the privacy of a room to the outside 
world. Sometimes the Commissioner carried his affectation of 
Medievalism to a drastic extreme. 

Like his glasses, Baley thought. 

That was it! That was what 
made him look wrong! 

T> ALEY said, "Pardon me, 
Commissioner, but you're 
wearing new glasses, aren't you?" 

The Commissioner stared at 
him in mild surprise, took off his 
glasses, looked at them and then 
at Baley. Without his glasses, 
his round face seemed rounder 
and his chin a trifle more pronounced. He looked vaguer, too, 
as his eyes failed to focus properly


THE CAVES OF STEEL

"Yes." He put his glasses back 
on his nose, then added with real 
anger, "I broke my old ones three 
days ago. What with one thing 
and another, I wasn't able to replace them till this morning. Lije, 
those three days were hell." 

"On account of the glasses?" 

"And other things, too. I'm getting to that." 

He turned to the window and 
so did Baley. With mild shock, 
Baley realized it was raining. For 
a minute, he was lost in the spectacle of water dropping from the 
sky, while the Commissioner exuded a kind of pride, as though 
the phenomenon were a matter of 
his own arranging. 

"This is the third time this 
month I've watched it rain. Quite 
a sight, don't you think?" 

Against his will, Baley had to 
admit to himself that it was impressive. In his forty-two years, 
he had rarely seen rain or any of 
the phenomena of nature, for that 
matter. 

He said, "It always seems a 
waste for all that water to come 
down on the city. It should restrict itself to the reservoirs." 

"Lije," said the Commissioner, 
"you're a Modernist. That's 
your trouble. In Medieval times, 
people lived in the open. I don't 
mean on the farms only. I mean 
in the cities, too. Even in New 
York. When it rained, they didn't 
think of it as waste. They gloried 



in it. They lived close to nature. 
It's healthier, better. The troubles 
of modern life come from being 
divorced from nature. Read up 
on the Coal Century sometime." 

Baley had. He had heard many 
people moaning about the invention of the atomic pile. He 
moaned about it himself when 
things went wrong, or when he 
got tired. Moaning like that was 
a built-in facet of human nature. 
Back in the Coal Century, people 
moaned about the invention of 
the steam engine. In one of 
Shakespeare's plays, a character 
moaned about the invention of 
gunpowder. A thousand years in 
the future, they'd be moaning 
about the invention of other 
things. 

The hell with it. 

He said, grimly, "Look, 
Julius." It wasn't his habit to get 
friendly with the Commissioner 
during office hours, however 
many "Lije"s the Commissioner 
threw at him, but something 
special seemed called for here. 
"You're talking about everything 
except what I came in here for 
and it's worrying me. What is 
it?" 

The Commissioner said, "I'll 
get to it, Lije. Let me do it my 
way. It's trouble." 

"Sure. What isn't on this planet? More trouble with the Rs?" 

"In a way, yes, Lije. I stand 
here and wonder how much more 



8 




 



trouble the old world can take. 
When I put in this window, I 
wasn't just letting in the sky 
once in a while. I let in the City. 
I look at it and I wonder what 
will become of it in another century." 

T IJE BALEY felt repelled by 
the other's sentimentality, 
but he found himself staring outward in fascination. Even dimmed by the weather, the City was 
a tremendous thing to see. The 
Police Department was in the 
upper levels of City Hall, and 
City Hall reached high. From the 
Commissioner's window, the 
neighboring towers fell short and 
the tops were visible. They were 
so many fingers, groping upward. 
Their walls were blank, featureless. They were the outer shells 
of a giant human hive. 

"In a way," said the Commissioner, "I'm sorry it's raining. 
We can't see Spacetown." 

Baley looked westward, but the 
horizon had closed down. New 
York's towers grew misty and 
came to an end against blank 
whiteness. 

"I know what Spacetown is 
like," Baley replied. 

"I like the picture from here," 
said the Commissioner. "It can 
just be made out in the gap between the two Brunswick Sectors. 
Low domes spread out. It's the 
difference between us and the 



Spacers. We reach high and 
crowd close. With them, each 
family has a dome for itself. One 
family, one house. And land between each dome. Have you ever 
spoken to any of the Spacers, 
Lije?" 

"A few times. About a month 
ago, I spoke to one right here on 
your intercom." 

"Yes, I remember. But then 
I'm just getting philosophical. 
We and they — different ways of 
life." 

Baley's stomach was beginning 
to constrict a little. The more 
devious the Commissioner's approach, the deadlier he suspected 
might be the conclusion. 

He said, "All right. But what's 
so surprising about it? You can't 
spread eight billion people over 
Earth in little domes. They've 
got space on their worlds, so let 
them live their way." 

The Commissioner walked to 
his chair and sat down. His eyes 
looked unblinkingly at Baley, 
shrunken a bit by the concave 
lenses in his spectacles. He said, 
"Not everyone is that tolerant 
about differences in culture. 
Either among us or among the 
Spacers." 

"All right. So what?" 

"Three days ago, a Spacer 
died." 

Now it was coming. The corners of Baley's thin lips tightened 
a trifle, but the effect upon his 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



long, sad face was unnoticeable. 
He said, "Too bad. Something 
contagious, I hope. A virus. A 
cold, perhaps." 

The Commissioner looked 
startled. "What are you talking 
about?" 

Baley didn't care to explain. 
The efficiency with which the 
Spacers had bred disease out of 
their societies was well known. 
The care with which they avoided 
contact with disease-riddled 
Earthmen, as far as possible, was 
even better known. But, then, 
sarcasm was lost on the Commissioner. 

"I'm just talking," Baley said. 
"What did he die of?" He turned 
back to the window. 

The Commissioner said, "He 
died of a missing chest. Someone 
had used a blaster on him." 

T>ALEY'S back grew rigid. He 
■*-*asked, without turning, "What 
are you talking about?" 

"You're a plainclothesman. 
You know what murder is." 

Baley abruptly turned. "But a 
Spacer! Three days ago?" 

"Yes." 

"Who did it? How?" 
"The Spacers say it was an 
Earthman." 
"It can't be" 

"Why not? You don't like the 
Spacers. I don't. Who on Earth 
does? Someone didn't like them 
a little too much, that's all." 



"Sure, but — " 

"There was the fire at the Los 
Angeles factories. There was the 
Berlin R-smashing. There were 
the riots in Shanghai," 

"Well?" 

"It all points to rising discontent. Maybe to some sort of organization." 

Baley said, "Commissioner, I 
don't get this. Are you testing me 
for some reason?" 

The Commissioner looked honestly bewildered. 

"Three days ago, a Spacer was 
murdered and the Spacers think 
the murderer is an Earthman. 
Till now, nothing's come out. Is 
that right? Commissioner, that's 
unbelievable. A thing like this 
would blow New York off the 
face of the planet if it really 
happened !" 

The Commissioner shook his 
head. "It's not as simple as that. 
Look, Lije, I've been away three 
days. I've been in conference with 
the Mayor. I've been out to 
Spacetown. I've been down in 
Washington, talking to the Terrestrial Bureau of Investigation." 

"Oh? And what do the Terries 
have to say?" 

"They say it's our baby. Spacetown is under New York jurisdiction. " 

"But with extraterritorial 
rights." 

"I know. I'm coming to that." 
The Commissioner's eyes fell 



10 




 



away from Baley's flinty stare. 
He seemed to regard himself as 
having been suddenly demoted to 
the position of Baley's underling, 
and Baley behaved as though he 
accepted the fact. 

"The Spacers can run the 
show," said Baley. 

"Wait a minute, Lije," pleaded 
the Commissioner. "Don't rush 
me. I'm trying to talk this over, 
friend to friend. I want you to 
know my position. I was there 
when the news broke. I had an 
appointment with him — with Roj 
Nemennuh Sarton." 

"The victim?" 

"That's right.'* The Commissioner groaned. "Five minutes 
more and I myself would have 
discovered the body. What a 
shock that would have been! As 
it was, it was brutal. Brutal! 
They met me and told me. It 
started a three-day nightmare, 
Lije. That on top of having everything blur on me and having no 
time to replace my glasses for 
days. That won't happen again, 
at least. I've ordered three pairs." 

T IJE Baley considered the picture he conjured up of the 
event. He could see the tall, fair 
Spacers approaching the Commissioner with the news and 
breaking it to him in their unvarnished emotionless way. Julius 
would remove his glasses and 
polish them. Inevitably, under 



the impact of the event, he would 
drop them, then look down at the 
broken remnants with a quiver of 
his soft, full lips. Baley was quite 
certain that for five minutes, anyway, the Commissioner was much 
more disturbed over his glasses 
than over the murder. 

The Commissioner was saying, 
"It's a devil of a position. As you 
say, the Spacers have extraterritorial rights. They can insist on 
their own investigation, make 
whatever report they wish to their 
home governments. The Outer 
Worlds could use this as an excuse to pile on indemnity charges. 
You know how that would be 
taken by Earth." 

"It would be political suicide 
if the President agreed to pay." 

"And another kind of suicide 
not to." 

"You don't have to draw me a 
diagram," said Baley. He had 
been a small boy when the gleaming cruisers from outer space sent 
down their soldiers into Washington, New York, Moscow, 
Paris, London and Canton to collect what they claimed was theirs. 

"Then you see," the Commissioner said. "Pay or not pay, it 
means trouble. The only way out 
is to find the murderer and hand 
him over to the Spacers. It's 
up to us." 

"Why not give it to the T.B.I. 
even if it is legally within our 
jurisdiction? There's the question 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



11 



of interstellar relations-—" 

"The T.B.I, won't touch it. 
This is hot and it's in our lap." 
For a moment, he lifted his head 
and peered keenly at his subordinate. "And it's not good, Lije. 
Every one of us stands the chance 
of being out of a job." 

"Replace all of us?" Baley demanded. "Yeast ! The trained 
men to do it with don't exist." 

"Robots," said the Commissioner. "They exist." 

"What?" 

"R. Sammy is just a beginning. 
He runs errands. Other robots can 
patrol the Expressways, control 
traffic — I hear it's been tried in 
other cities experimentally and it 
seems to work. There are robots 
that can do your work. Yes, and 
mine. Don't think we can't be declassified. And at our age, to 
wind up in the labor pool — " 

Baley said gruffly, "All right!" 

The Commissioner looked 
abashed. "Sorry, Lije." 

Baley nodded and tried not to 
think of his father. The Commissioner knew the facts from his 
Service file, of course. 

"You evidently think all this 
replacement business is threatening you - and me," Baley said. 
"There's a limit to how far it 
can go." 

"T OOK, you're being naive, 
•^Lije. It's been getting worse 
and worse ever since the Spacers 



came, twenty-five years ago. It's 
just beginning to reach higher, 
that's all. If we muff this case, 
it's a big, long step toward the 
point where we can stop looking 
forward to collecting our pensiontab booklets. On the other hand, 
Lije, if we handle the matter well, 
it can push the danger far into 
the future. And it would be a particular break for you." 

"For me?" asked Baley. 

"You'll be the operative in 
charge, Lije." 

"I don't rate it, Commissioner. 
I'm only a C-5." 

"You want a C-6 rating, don't 
you?" 

Did he? Baley knew the privileges of a C-6. A seat on the Expressway in the rush hour, not 
just from ten to four. Higher up 
on the list-of-choice at the Section Kitchens. Maybe even a 
chance at a better apartment and 
a quota ticket to the Solarium 
levels for Jessie. 

"I want it," he said. "Sure. But 
what would I get if I couldn't 
break the case?" 

"Why wouldn't you break it, 
Lije?" wheedled the Commissioner. "You're a good man." 

"But there are half a dozen 
men with higher ratings in* my 
Department Section. Why should 
they be passed over?" 

The Commissioner folded his 
hands. "Two reasons. You're not 
just another detective to me, Lije. 



13 




 



We're friends, too. I'm not forgetting we were in college together. Sometimes it may look as 
though I have forgotten, but 
that's the fault of rating. I'm 
Commissioner and you know 
what that means. But I'm still 
your friend and this is a tremendous chance for the right person. 
I want you to have it." 

"That's one reason," said 
Baley, without warmth. 

"The second reason is that I 
need a favor." 

"What sort of favor?" 

"The Spacers agreed not to report the murder and to leave the 
investigation in our hands. In 
return, they insist that one of 
their own agents be in on the deal 
— the whole deal." 

"It sounds like they don't trust 
us altogether." 

"Surely you see their point. If 
this is mishandled, a number of 
them will be in trouble with their 
own governments. I'll give them 
the benefit of the doubt, Lije. 
I'm willing to believe they mean 
well." 

"I'm sure they do, Commissioner. That's the trouble with 
them." 

rpHE Commissioner looked 
blank at that, but went on, 
"Are you willing to take on a 
Spacer partner, Lije?" 

"You're asking that as a 
favor?" 



"Yes, I'm asking you to take 
the job with all the conditions 
the Spacers have set up." 

"I'll take a Spacer partner, 
Commissioner." 

"Thanks, Lije, He'll have to 
live with you." 

"Oh, now, hold on I" 

"I know, I know. But you've 
got a large apartment, Lije. Three 
rooms. Only one child. He'll be 
no trouble at all. And it's necessary." 

"Jessie won't like it." 

"You tell Jessie — " the Commissioner was so earnest that his 
eyes seemed to bore holes through 
the glass discs blocking his stare 
— "that if you do this for me, 
I'll do what I can to jump you a 
grade. C-7, Lije. C-7!" 

"All right, Commissioner, it's 
a deal." 

Baley half-rose from his chair, 
caught the look on Enderby's 
face and sat down again. 

"There's something else?" 

Slowly, the Commissioner 
nodded. "One more item." 

"Which is?" 

"The name of your partner." 
"What difference does that 
make?" 

"The Spacers," said the Commissioner, "have peculiar ways. 
The partner they're supplying 
isn't — isn't — " 

Baley's eyes opened wide. "Just 
a minute!" 

"You've got to, Lije. You've 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



got to. There's no way out." 

"Stay at my apartment? A 
thing like that?" 

"Lije, I can't trust anyone else 
in this. Do I have to spell it 
out for you? We've got to work 
with the Spacers. We've got to 
succeed, if we're to keep the indemnity ships away from Earth. 
But we can't succeed just any 
old way. You'll be partnered with 
one of their Rs. If ftfi breaks the 
case, if he can report that we're 
incompetent, we're ruined, anyway. We as a Department. You 
see that, don't you? So you've 
got a delicate job on your hands. 
You have to work with him, yet 
see to it that you solve the case 
and not he. Understand?" 

"You mean cooperate with him 
one hundred per cent except that 
I cut his throat? Pat him on 
the back with a knife in my 
hand?" 

"What else can we do? There's 
no other way out." 

Lije Baley stood irresolute. "I 
don't know what Jessie will say." 

"I'll talk to her, if you want 
me to." 

"No, Commissioner." He drew 
a deep, sighing breflth. "What's 
my partner's name?'' 

"R. Daneel Olivatf." 

Baley said. "This isn't a time 
for euphemism. Commissioner. 
I'm taking the job, so let's use 
his full name. Robot Daneel 
Olivaw." 



CHAPTER II 

THERE was the usual crowd 
on the Expressway ; the 
standees on the lower level and 
those with seat-privileges above. 
A continuous trickle of humanity 
filtered off the Expressway, across 
the decelerating strips to localways or into the Stationaries that 
led under arches or over bridges 
into the endless mazes of the City 
Sections. Another trickle, just as 
continuous, worked inward from 
the other side, across the accelerating strips and onto the Expressway. 

There were the infinite lights, 
the luminous walls and ceilings 
that seemed to drip cool, even 
phosphorescence; the flashing advertisements screaming for attention; the harsh, steady gleam 
of the "lightworms" that directed 

THIS WAY TO JERSEY SECTIONS. 
FOLLOW ARROWS TO EAST RIVER 
SHUTTLE. UPPER LEVEL FOR ALL 
WAYS TO LONG ISLAND SECTIONS. 

Most of all, there was the 
noise that was inseparable from 
life. The sound of millions talking, laughing, coughing, calling, 
humming, breathing. 

He stepped from strip to strip 
with the ease of a lifetime's practice. Children learned to "hop the 
strips" as soon as they learned 
to walk. Baley scarcely felt the 
jerk of acceleration as his velocity 
increased with each step. He was 



14 




 



not even aware that he leaned 
forward against the force. In 
thirty seconds, he had reached the 
final sixty-mile-an-hour strip and 
could step aboard the railed and 
glassed-in moving platform that 
was the Expressway. 

No directions to Spacetown, 
he thought. 

No need for directions. If you 
had business there, you knew the 
way. If you didn't know the way, 
you had no business there. When 
Spacetown was first established 
some twenty-five years earlier, 
there had been a strong tendency 
to make a showplace out of it. 
The hordes of the City herded in 
that direction. 

The Spacers put a stop to that. 
Politely — they were always polite — but without any compromise with tact, they put up a 
force barrier between themselves 
and the City. They established a 
combination Immigration Service and Customs Inspection. 

It gave rise to dissatisfaction, 
naturally. More dissatisfaction 
than it deserved. Baley remembered the Barrier Riots. He had 
been part of the mob that had 
suspended itself from the rails 
of the Expressways, crowded onto 
the seats in disregard of rating 
privileges, run recklessly along 
and across the strips at the risk 
of a broken body, and remained 
just outside the Spacetown Barrier for two days, shouting slogans 



and destroying City property out 
of sheer frustration. 

Baley could still sing the chants 
of the time if he put his mind 
to it. There was "Man was born 
on Mother Earth, do you hear?" 
to an old folk-tune called "Hinkydinky-parley-voo." 

Man was born an Mother Earth, 

do you hear? 
Earth's the world that gave him 

birth, do you hear? 
Spacer, get you off the face 
Of Mother Earth and into space. 
Dirty Spacer, do you hear?" 

fTIHERE were hundreds of 
verses. A few were witty, most 
were stupid, many were obscene. 
Every one, however, ended with 
"Dirty Spacer, do you hear?" 
Dirty, dirty. It was the futile 
throwing back at the Spacers 
their most keenly felt insult — 
their insistence on considering the 
natives of Earth as disgustingly 
diseased. 

The Spacers didn't leave, of 
course. Earth's outmoded fleet 
had long since learned that it was 
suicide to challenge any Outer 
World ship. Earth planes had 
angrily ventured over Spacetown 
in the very early days of its 
establishment and simply disappeared. Only a shredded wingtip or two had tumbled down 
to the ground. 

And no mob could be so mad


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



15 



dened as to forget the effect of 
the partable sub-etheric disrupters used on Earthmen in those 
days. 

So the Spacers sat behind their 
Barrier, which itself was the product of their own advanced science, and which no method 
known on Earth could duplicate 
or break. They just waited stolidly on the other side of the Barrier until the City quieted the 
mob with somno-vapor and retchgas. The below-level penitentiaries rattled afterward with 
ringleaders, malcontents, and 
people who had been picked up 
only because they were nearest 
at hand. They were all set free 
before long. 

After a proper interval, the 
Spacers eased their restrictions. 
The Barrier was removed and the 
City Police entrusted with maintaining Spacetown's arrogant, 
threatening isolation. 

Now, thought Baley, things 
might take a reverse trend. If the 
Spacers seriously thought that 
an Earthman had entered Spacetown and committed murder, the 
Barrier might go up again. It 
would be bad, he thought, knowing just how grotesque an understatement that was. 

He lifted himself onto the Expressway platform, made his way 
through the standees to the tight 
spiral ramp that led to the upper 
level, and sat down. He didn't 



put his rating ticket in his hatband till they passed the last of 
the Hudson sections. A C-5 had 
no seat rights east of the Hudson 
and west of Long Island, and although there was ample seating 
available, one of the Way guards 
would have automatically ousted 
him. People were increasingly 
petty about rating privileges and, 
in all honesty, Baley lumped 
himself in with "people." 

ri~VHE air made the characteristic whistling norse as it frictioned off the curved windshields 
set above the back of every seat. 
It made talking a chore, but was 
no bar to thinking when you were 
used to it. 

Baley's thinking was interrupted by a female shriek. A woman 
had dropped her handbag ; he 
saw it for an instant, a pastel 
pink blob against the dull gray of 
the strips. A corner of Baley's 
mouth quirked. She might catch 
up with it, if she were clever 
enough and if passengers did not 
accidentally kick it this way and 
that. He would never know 
whether she did or not. The scene 
was already half a mile to the 
rear. 

Chances were she wouldn't. He 
knew the statistics — an article 
was dropped on the strips somewhere in the City every three 
minutes and only one out of 
seventeen was recovered. The 



16 




 



Lost and Found Department was 
among the biggest bureaus in the 
City. It was just one more complication of modern life. 

It was simpler once, Baley 
thought. That was what made 
Medievalists. Most Earthmen 
were Medievalists in one way or 
another. It was an easy thing 
to be when it meant looking back 
to a time when Earth was the 
world and not just one of fifty. 
The misfit one of fifty at that. 

Medievalism took different 
forms. To the unimaginative 
Julius Enderby, it meant the 
adoption of anachronisms — spectacles, windows. 

To Baley, it was the study of 
history, particularly the history 
of folkways. 

The City now — New York 
City, in which he lived and had 
his being. Larger than any City 
but Los Angeles. More populous 
than any but Shanghai. It was 
only three centuries old. 

To be sure, something had existed in the same geographic area 
before then that had been called 
New York City. That primitive 
gathering of population had existed for three thousand years, 
not three hundred, but it hadn't 
been a City. 

There were no Cities then, just 
huddles of dwellings large and 
small, open to the air. They were 
something like the Space Domes, 
only much different, of course. 



These huddles — the largest barely 
reached ten million in population 
and most were under a million — 
were scattered all over Earth by 
the thousands. By modern standards, they had been completely 
inefficient economically. 

"CiFFICIENCY had been forced 
on Earth with increasing population. Two billion people, three 
billion, even five billion could be 
supported by the planet by progressive lowering of the standard 
of living. When the population 
reaches eight billion, however, 
semi-starvation becomes the 
norm. A radical change had to 
take place in Man's culture, particularly when it turned out that 
the Outer Worlds (which had 
merely been Earth's colonies a 
thousand years before) were 
serious about their immigration 
restrictions. 

The radical change had been 
the gradual formation of the 
Cities over a thousand years of 
Earth's history. Efficiency implied bigness. Even in Medieval 
times, that had been realized, 
perhaps unconsciously. Home industry gave way to factories, and 
factories to continental industries. 

Think of the inefficiency of a 
hundred thousand houses for a 
hundred thousand families as 
compared with a hundred-thousand-unit Section; a book-film 
collection in each house, as com


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



pared with a Section film-concentrate ; independent video for 
each family as compared with 
video-piping systems. 

For that matter, take the simple folly of endless duplication 
of kitchens and bathrooms as 
compared with the thoroughly 
efficient diners and shower rooms 
made possible by City culture. 

More and more, the villages, 
towns and "cities" of Earth died 
and were swallowed by the Cities. 
Even the early prospects of 
atomic war only slowed the trend. 

City culture meant optimum 
distribution of food, increasing 
utilization of yeasts and hydroponics. New York City spread 
over two thousand square miles 
and at the last census, its population was well over twenty 
million. There were some eight 
hundred cities on Earth with an 
average population of ten million. 

Each City became a semi-autonomous unit, economically all 
but self-sufficient. It could roof 
itself in, gird itself about, burrow 
itself under. It became a cave, a 
tremendous, self-contained cave 
of steel and concrete. 

It could lay itself out scientifically. .At the center was the 
enormous complex of administrative offices. In careful orientation to one another and to the 
whole were the large residential 
Sections connected and interlaced 
by the Expressway and the Local


ways. Toward the outskirts were 
the factories, the hydroponic 
plants, the yeast-culture vats, the 
power plants. Through all this 
ran the water-pipes and sewageducts, schools, prisons and shops, 
power lines and communicationbeams. 

No doubt about it, the City 
was the culmination of Man's 
mastery over the environment. 
Not space-travel, not the fifty 
colonized worlds that were now 
so haughtily independent, but 
the City. 

T>R ACTI CA LLY none of 
Earth's population lived outside the Cities. Outside was the 
wilderness, the open sky that few 
men could face with anything like 
equanimity. To be sure, the open 
space was necessary. It held the 
water that men must have, 
the coal and the wood that 
were the ultimate raw materials 
for plastics and for the eternally 
growing yeast. (Petroleum had 
long vanished, but oil-rich strains 
of yeast were an adequate substitute.) The land between the Cities 
still held the mines, and was still 
used to a larger extent than most 
men realized for growing food 
and grazing stock. It was inefficient, but beef, pork and grain 
always found a luxury market 
and could be used for export 
purposes. 

But few humans were required 



18 




 



to run the mines and ranches, to 
exploit the farms and pipe the 
water, and these supervised at 
long distance. Robots did the 
work better and required less. 

Robots. That was the one huge 
irony. It was on Earth that the 
posit ronic brain had been invented and on Earth that robots 
had first been put to productive 
use. Not on the Outer Worlds, 
though the Outer Worlds always 
acted as if robots had been born 
of their culture. 

In a way, of course, the culmination of robot economy had 
taken place on the Outer Worlds. 
Here on Earth, robots had always 
been restricted to the mines and 
farmlands. Only in the last quarter-century, under the urgings of 
the Spacers, had robots filtered 
their slow way into the Cities. 

The Cities were good. Everyone but the Medievalists knew 
that they had no reasonable substitute. The only trouble was that 
they wouldn't stay good. Earth's 
population was still rising. Some 
day, with all that the Cities 
could do, the available calories 
per person would simply fall below basic subsistence level. 

It was all the worse because of 
the existence of the Spacers, the 
descendants of the early emigrants from Earth, living in luxury on their underpopulated robot-ridden worlds out in space. 
They were coolly determined to 



keep the comfort that grew out of 
the emptiness of their worlds, and 
for that purpose they kept their 
birth-rate down and immigrants 
from teeming Earth out. And 
this — 

A nudge at Baley's unconscious 
warned him that he was approaching the Newark Section. 
If he stayed where he was much 
longer, he'd find himself speeding 
southwestward to the Trenton 
Section turning of the Way, 
through the heart of the warm 
and musty-odored yeast country. 

It was a matter of timing — 
so long to shinny down the steps, 
so long to squirm through the 
grunting standees, so long to slip 
along the railing and out an 
opening, so long to hop across 
the decelerating strips. 

When he was done, he was 
precisely at the off -shooting of 
the proper Stationary. At no time 
did he time his steps consciously. 
If he had, he would probably 
have missed. 

T>ALEY found himself in unusual semi-isolation. Only a 
policeman was with him inside 
the Stationary and, except for the 
unnoticed whirring of the Expressway, there was an almost 
uncomfortable silence. 

The policeman approached, 
and Baley flashed his badge impatiently. The policeman lifted 
his hand in permission to pass on. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



19 



The passage narrowed and 
curved sharply three or four 
times. That was obviously deliberate. Mobs of Earthmen 
couldn't gather in it and direct 
charges were impossible. 

A Spacer was standing at the 
point where a series of doors 
marked the openings to the open 
air and the domes of Spacetown. 
He was dressed in Earth fashion, 
trousers tight at the waist, loose 
at the ankle and color-striped 
down the seam of each leg. He 
wore an ordinary Textron shirt, 
open collar, seam-zipped and 
ruffled at the wrist, but the way 
he stood, the way he held his 
head, the calm and unemotional 
lines of his broad, high-cheekboned face, the careful set of his 
short, bronze hair lying flatly 
backward and without a part 
marked him as a Spacer. 

Baley approached and said in 
a monotone, "I am Plainclothesman Elijah Baley, Police Department, City of New York, Rating 
C-5." He showed his credentials. 
"I have been instructed to meet 
R. Daneel Olivaw at Spacetown 
Approachway." He looked at his 
watch. "I am a little early. May 
• I request, the announcement of 
my presence?" 

The Spacer, who had listened 
politely, said, "It will not be necessary. I have been waiting for 
you." 

Baley's hand went up auto


matically, then dropped. So did 
his long chin. He didn't quite 
manage to say anything. The 
words froze. 

The Spacer said, "I shall introduce myself. I am R. Daneel 
Olivaw." 

"Yes? Am I making a mistake? 
I thought the first initial — " 

"Quite so. I am a robot." 

T>UTTING a damp hand to his 
hair, Baley smoothed it back 
unnecessarily. Then he held the 
hand out. "I'm sorry, Mr. Olivaw. 
I don't know what I was thinking 
of. I am Elijah Baley, your partner." 

The robot's hand closed on his 
with a smoothly increasing pressure that reached a comfortably 
friendly peak, then declined. "I 
seem to detect disturbance. May 
I ask that you be frank with 
me? It is best to have as many 
relevant facts as possible in a relationship such as ours. And it is 
customary on my world for partners to call one another by the 
familiar name. I trust that that 
is not counter to your own customs." 

"It's just that you don't look 
like a robot," said Baley desperately. 

"And that disturbs you?" 

"It shouldn't, I suppose, Da — 
Daneel. Are they all like you on 
your world?" 

"There are individual differ 


20 




 



ences, Elijah, as with men." 

"Our own robots — Well, you 
can tell they're robots. You look 
like a Spacer." 

"Oh, I see. You expected a 
rather crude model and were surprised. Yet it is only logical that 
our people should use a robot 
of pronounced humanoid characteristics in this case if we expected to avoid unpleasantness. 
Is that not so?" 

It was certainly so. An undisguised robot roaming the City 
would be in quick trouble. 

Baley said, "Yes." 

"Then let us leave now, Elijah." 

They made their way back to 
the Expressway. Robot Daneel 
caught the purpose of the accelerating strips and maneuvered 
along them with a quick proficiency. Baley, who had begun 
by moderating his speed, ended 
by hastening it in annoyance. He 
reached the endless cars of Expressway and scrambled aboard 
with what amounted to outright 
recklessness. The robot followed 
easily. 

Baley was red. He swallowed 
twice and said, "I'll stay down 
here with you." 

"Down here?" The robot, apparently oblivious to both the 
noise and the rhythmic swaying 
of the platform, said, "Is my information wrong? I was told that 
a rating of C-5 entitled one to a 



seat on the upper level under 
certain conditions." 

"You're right. I can go up 
there, but you won't know where 
to get off if I'm not with you." 

"Why can I not go up with 
you?" 

"It takes a C-5, Daneel." 

Talking was difficult. The hiss 
of frictioning air was louder on 
the less-shielded lower level and 
Baley was understandably anxious to keep his voice low. 

R. Daneel said. "Why should 
I not be a C-5? I am your partner and, consequently, of equal 
rank. I was given this." 

From an inner shirt pocket he 
produced a rectangular credential card, quite genuine. The 
name given was Daneel Olivaw, 
without the all-important initial. 
The rating was C-5. 

"Come on up," said Baley 
woodenly. 

Seated. Baley looked straight 
ahead, angry with himself, very 
conscious of the robot sitting 
next to him. He had been caught 
twice. He had not recognized R. 
Daneel as a robot; he had not 
guessed the logic that demanded 
R. Daneel be given C-5 rating. 

The trouble was, of course, that 
he was not the plainclothesman 
of popular myth. He was not incapable of surprise, imperturbable of appearance, infinite of 
adaptability, and lightning of 
mental grasp. He had never sup


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



posed he was, but he had never 
regretted the lack before. 

What made him regret it was 
that, to all appearances, R. 
Daneel Olivaw was that very 
myth embodied. 

He had to be. He was a robot. 

Baley began to find excuses for 
himself. He was accustomed to 
the robots like R. Sammy at the 
ofHce. He had expected a creature 
with a skin of hard and glossy 
plastic, nearly dead white in 
color. He had expected an expression fixed at an unreal level 
of inane good humor. He had 
expected jerky, faintly uncertain 
motions. 

R. Daneel was none of that. 

Baley risked a quick sideglance at the robot. R. Daneel 
turned simultaneously to meet 
his eye and nod gravely. His lips 
had moved naturally when he 
had spoken and did not simply 
remain parted as those of Earth 
robots did. There had been 
glimpses of an articulating 
tongue. 

Baley thought: Why does he 
have to sit there so calmly? This 
must be something completely 
new to him — noise, lights, crowds. 

Baley got up, brushed past R. 
Daneel and said, "Follow me." 

Off the Expressway, down the 
decelerating strips. 

Baley thought: Good Lord, 
what do I tell Jessie, anyway? 

The coming of the robot had 



rattled that thought out of his 
head, but it was coming back 
with sickening urgency, now that 
they were heading down the 
Localway that led into the Lower 
Bronx Section. 

He said, "This is all one building, you know. Daneel; everything you see, the whole City. 
Twenty million people live in it. 
The Expressways go continuously, night and day, at sixty miles 
an hour. There are nine hundred 
and fifty miles of it altogether 
and thousands of miles of Localways." 

Any minute now, Baley 
thought, I'll be figuring out how 
many tons of yeast -product New 
York eats per day and how many 
cubic feet of water we drink and 
how many megawatts of power 
the atomic piles deliver per hour. 

Daneel said, "I was informed 
of this and other similar data in 
my briefing." 

Baley thought: Well, that covers the food, drink, and power 
situation, too, I suppose. Why try 
to impress a robot? 

THEY were at East 182nd 
Street and, in not more than 
two hundred yards, they would 
be at the elevator banks that fed 
.those steel and concrete layers of 
apartments that included his own. 

He was on the point of saying, 
"This way," when he was stopped 
by a knot of people gathering 



22 




 



outside the brilliantly lighted 
force-door of one of the many 
retail departments that lined the 
ground levels solidly in this Section. 

He asked of the nearest in an 
automatic tone of authority, 
"What's going on?" 

The man he addressed, who 
was standing on tiptoe, said, 
"Damned if I know. I just got 
here." 

Someone else said excitedly, 
"They got those lousy Rs in there. 
I think maybe they'll throw them 
out here. Boy, I'd like to take 
them apart." 

Baley looked nervously at 
Daneel, but if the latter caught 
the significance of the words or 
even heard them, he did not show 
it. 

Baley plunged into the crowd. 
"Let me through. Police!" 

They made way. Baley caught 
words behind him. 

u — take them apart nut by nut, 
split them down the seams slowlike — " And someone else laughed. 

Baley turned a little cold. The 
City was the acme of efficiency, 
but it made demands of its inhabitants. It asked them to live 
in a tight routine and order 
their lives under a strict and 
scientific control. Occasionally, 
built-up inhibitions exploded. 

He remembered the Barrier 
riots. 



Reasons for anti -robot rioting 
certainly existed. Men who found 
themselves faced with the prospect of declassification, after half 
a lifetime of effort, could not decide cold-bloodedly that individual robots were not to blame. 
Individual robots could at least 
be struck at. 

One could not strike at something called "governmental policy" or at a slogan like "Higher 
production with robot labor." 

The government called it growing pains. It shook its collective 
head sorrowfully and assured 
everyone that, after a necessary 
period of adjustment, a new and 
better life would exist for all. 

But the Medievalist movement 
expanded along with the declassification process. Men grew frightened and the border between 
bitter frustration and wild destruction is sometimes easily 
crossed. 

At this moment, minutes could 
be separating the hostility of the 
crowd from a flashing orgy of 
blood and smash. 

Baley writhed his way desperately to the force-door. 

CHAPTER III 

THE interior of the store was 
emptier than the street outside. The manager, with commendable foresight had thrown 
the force-door early in the game, 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



23 



preventing potential troublemakers from entering. It also kept the 
principals in the argument from 
leaving, but that was minor. 

Baley got through the forcedoor by using his official neutralizer. Unexpectedly, he found 
R. Daneel still behind him. The 
robot was pocketing a neutralizer 
of his own — a slim one, smaller 
and neater than the standard 
police model. 

The manager ran to them instantly, talking loudly. "Officers, 
my clerks have been assigned me 
by the City. I am perfectly within 
my rights." 

There were three robots standing rodlike at the rear of the 
department. Six humans were 
standing near the force-door. 
They were all women. 

"All right now," said Baley 
crisply. "What's going on? What's 
all the fuss about?" 

One of the women said shrilly, 
"I came in for shoes. Why can't 
I have a human clerk? Ain't I 
respectable?" 

The manager said, "111 wait 
on her myself if I have to, but 
I can't wait on all of them, 
Officer. There's nothing wrong 
with my men. They're registered 
clerks. I have their spec charts 
and guarantee slips — " 

"Spec charts!" screamed the 
woman, turning to the rest. "He 
calls them men! They ain't men. 
They're ro—bots!" She stretched 



out the syllables. "And I tell you 
what they do, in case you don't 
know. They steal jobs from men." 

A voice sounded from the other 
side of the force-door, queerly 
deadened and distorted by the 
effects of the barrier of inertia, 
but with anger still clearly audible. "My job! My job they 
took!" 

A figure shoved furiously 
through the crowd. The face was 
pale in the corridor lights; arms 
waved wildly. "I was ten years 
on that job. Now my kids ain't 
got enough to eat. Why? Why? 
I should've been born a robot. 
The Government takes care of 
them all right!" 

The crowd roared. 

T> ALEY was brutally conscious 
of R. Daneel Olivaw standing at his elbow. He looked at 
the clerks. They were Earthmade, and even on that scale, 
relatively inexpensive models. 

They were just robots made 
to know such simple things as 
all the style numbers, their prices, 
the sizes available in each. They 
could keep track uf inventory 
better than humans could since 
they would have no outside interests. They could compute the 
proper orders for the next week. 
They could measure the customer's foot. 

In themselves, harmless. As a 
group, incredibly dangerous.

Baley could sympathize with 
the woman more deeply than he 
would have believed possible two 
hours before. Wondering if R. 
Daneel could not replace an ordinary Plainclothesman C-5, he 
could see the barracks, could 
taste the yeast -mush, and he 
could remember his father. 

His father had been a nuclear 
physicist, with a rating that had 
put him in the top percentile of 
the City. There had been an accident at the power plant and his 
father had borne the blame. He 
had been declassified. Baley did 
not know the details; it had happened when he was a year old. 

But he remembered the barracks of his childhood, the grinding communal existence just this 
side of the edge of bearability. He 
remembered his mother not at all; 
she had not survived long. His 
father he recalled well, a sodden 
man, morose and lost, speaking 
sometimes of the past in a hoarse, 
broken whisper. 

His father died, still declassified, when Baley was eight. 
Young Baley and his two older 
sisters moved into the Section 
orphanage. Children's Level, they 
called it. His mother's brother, 
whom Baley thought of always 
as "Uncle Boris," was himself too 
poor to prevent that. 

So it continued hard. And it 
was hard going through school, 
with no father-derived status


privileges to smooth the way. 

And now he had to stand in the 
middle of a growing riot and 
pacify or intimidate men and women who, after all, only feared 
declassification for themselves 
and those they loved, as he himself did. 

rpONELESSLY, he said to the 
woman who had spoken, 
"Let's not have any trouble, lady. 
The clerks aren't doing you any 
harm." 

"Sure they ain't done me no 
harm," snapped the woman. 
"They ain't gonna, either. Think 
IH let their cold, greasy fingers 
touch me? I came in here expecting to get treated like a human being. I got a right to have 
human beings wait on me. And, 
listen, I got two kids waiting for 
supper. They can't go to the Section Kitchen without me like they 
were orphans. I gotta get out of 
here." 

"If you had let yourself be 
waited on, you'd have been out 
of here by now. You're just making trouble for nothing." 

"Well!" The woman registered 
shock. "Maybe you think you 
can talk to me like I was dirt. 
Maybe it's time the Government 
realized robots ain't the only 
things on Earth. I'm a hardworking woman and I've got 
rights." 

Baley could feel the situation 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



25 



get out of hand. Even if the 
woman would consent to be waited on, the waiting crowd was 
ugly enough for anything. There 
must be a hundred crammed 
outside the display window now. 

"What is the usual procedure 
in such a case?" asked R. Daneel 
Olivaw suddenly. 

Baley nearly jumped. He said, 
"This is an unusual case in the 
first place." 

"What is the law?" 

"The Rs have been duly assigned here. They're registered 
clerks. There's nothing illegal 
about that." 

"In that case," said R. Daneel, 
"order the woman to let herself 
be waited on or to leave." 

"It's a mob we have to deal 
with, not a woman. There's nothing to do but call a riot squad." 

"It should not be necessary for 
citizens to require more than one 
officer of the law to direct what 
should be done." said Daneel. He 
turned his broad face to the store 
manager. "Open the force-door, 
sir." 

Baley's arm shot forward to 
seize R. Daneel's shoulder, swing 
him about. He arrested the motion. If, at* this moment, two lawmen quarreled openly, it would 
mean the end of all chance for a 
peaceful solution. 

The manager protested, looked 
at Baley. Baley did not meet his 
eye. 




26 




 



R. Daneel said, unmoved, "I 
order you with the authority of 
the Law." 

The manager bleated, "I'll hold 
the City responsible for any damage to the goods or fixtures. I 
serve notice that I'm doing this 
under orders." 

'T^HE barrier went down; men 
and women crowded in. There 
was a happy roar to them. They 
sensed victory. 

Baley had seen robots being 
lifted by a dozen hands, their 
heavy unresisting bodies carried 
backward from straining arm to 
straining arm. Men yanked and 
twisted at the metal mimicry of 
men. They used hammers, forceknives, needle-guns, and finally 
reduced the miserable objects to 
shredded metal and wire. Expensive positronic brains, the most 
intricate creation of the human 
mind, were thrown from hand to 
hand like footballs and mashed 
to uselessness in a trifle of time. 

Then, with, the genius of destruction so merrily let loose, the 
mobs turned on anything else that 
could be taken apart. 

The robot clerks could have no 
knowledge of any of this, so they 
stood smilingly ready to sell shoes 
as the crowd flooded inward. The 
woman who had started the fuss, 
frightened at seeing it grow so 
suddenly, gasped, "Here, now. 
Here, now." 



The manager was shrieking, 
"Stop them, Officer! Stop them!" 

R. Daneel spoke. Without apparent effort, his voice was suddenly decibels higher than a 
human's voice had a right to be. 
Of course, thought Baley for the 
tenth time, he's not — 

R. Daneel said, "The next man 
who moves will be shot." 

Someone well in the back yelled, "Get him!" 

But for a moment, no one 
moved. 

R. Daneel stepped nimbly upon 
a chair and from that to the 
top of a Transtex display case. 
The colored fluorescence gleaming through the slits of polarized 
molecular film turned his cool, 
smooth face into something unearthly. 

Unearthly, thought Baley. 

R. Daneel said crisply, "You 
are saying, 'This man is holding 
a neuronic whip, or a tickler. If 
we all rush forward, we will bear 
him down and at most one or two 
of us will be hurt and even they 
will recover. Meanwhile, we will 
do just as we wish and to space 
with law and order.' " His voice 
was neither harsh nor angry, but 
it carried authority. "You are 
mistaken. What I hold is not a 
neuronic whip, nor is it a tickler. 
It is a blaster and very deadly. I 
will kill many of you before you 
seize me — perhaps most of you." 

There was motion at the out


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



27 



skirts, but the crowd no longer 
grew. Those nearest R. Daneel 
were holding their breath, trying 
desperately to resist the mass 
pressure of those behind them. 

The woman with the hat broke 
the spell. "He's gonna kill ust I 
ain't done nothing! Oh, lemme 
outta here!" 

She turned, but faced an immovable wall of crammed men 
and women. 

R DANEEL jumped down 
• from the display counter 
and said, "I will now walk to the 
door. I will shoot the man or 
woman who touches me. When I 
» reach the door, I will shoot any 
man or woman who is not moving 
about his business. This woman 
here — " 

"No, no!" yelled the woman 
with the hat. "I tell you I didn't 
do anything. I didn't mean any 
harm. I don't want any shoes. I 
just want to go home." 

"This woman here," went on 
Daneel, "will remain. She will be 
waited on." 

He stepped forward. 

The mob faced him dumbly. 
Baley closed his eyes. It wasn't 
'his fault, he thought desperately. 
There'll be murder done and the 
worst mess in the world, but 
they forced a robot on me as 
partner. They gave him equal 
status. 

He didn't believe the excuse 



himself. He might have stopped 
R. Daneel at the start. He might 
have put in the call for a squadcar. He had let R. Daneel take 
responsibility, instead, and had 
felt a cowardly relief at it. When 
he tried to tell himself that R. 
Daneel's personality simply dominated the situation, he was filled 
with a sudden self-loathing. A 
robot dominating a situation! 

He was aware of no unusual 
noise, no shouting and cursing, 
no groans, no yells. His eyes 
sprang open. 

Jehoshaphat, they were dispersing! 

The manager of the store was 
cooling down, adjusting his 
twisted jacket, smoothing his 
hair, muttering angry threats at 
the vanishing crowd. One of the 
robot clerks advanced on the 
cowering woman with the hat and 
removed a shoe deftly. The robot's eye regarded it dispassionately for half a moment, then 
called out, "Size 6j^-C, last 14-X 
Alcove D-second shelf." A second clerk was already on the way 
to the indicated section. 

The smooth, fading whistle of 
a squad-car came to a halt just 
outside. Baley thought: Sure, 
when it's all over. 

The manager plucked his 
sleeve. "Let's have no more 
trouble, Officer." 

Baley said, "There won't be 
any trouble." 



28 




 



It was easy to get rid of the 
squad-car. They had come in response to reports of a crowd in 
the street. They knew no details 
and could only see for themselves 
that the street was clear. R. 
Daneel stepped aside and showed 
no sign of interest as Baley explained to the men in the squadcar, minimizing the event and 
completely burying R. Daneel's 
part in it. 

A FTER the car left he pulled 
**■ R. Daneel to one side, against 
the steel and concrete of one of 
the building shafts. 

"Listen," he said, "I'm not trying to steal your show, you understand." 

"Steal my show? Is that one 
of your Earth idioms?" 

"I didn't report your part in 
this." 

"I do not know all your customs. On my world, a complete 
report is usual, but perhaps it is 
not so on your world. In any 
case, civil rebellion was averted. 
That is the important thing, is 
it not?" 

"Is it? Now you look here." 
Baley tried to sound forceful. 
"Don't you ever do it again." 

"Never again insist on the observance of law? If I am not to 
do that, what then is my purpose?" 

"Don't ever threaten a human 
being with a blaster again." 



"I would not have fired under 
any circumstances, Elijah, as you 
know very well. I am incapable 
of hurting a human. But, as you 
see, I did not have to fire. I did 
not expect to have to." 

"That was pure luck, not having to fire. Don't take that kind 
of chance again. I could have 
pulled that grandstand stunt — " 

"Grandstand stunt? What is 
that?" 

"I could have pulled a blaster 
on the crowd myself. I had the 
blaster to do it with. But it 
isn't the kind of gamble I am 
justified in taking, or you, either. 
It was safer to call squad-cars to 
the scene than to try one-man 
heroics." 

R. Daneel considered. He shook 
his head. "I think you are wrong, 
partner Elijah. My briefing includes the information that, unlike the men of the Outer Worlds, 
Earthmen are trained from birth 
to accept authority. One man, 
representing authority firmly 
enough, was quite sufficient, as 
I proved. Your own desire for 
a squad-car was only an expression of your wish for superior 
authority to take responsibility 
out of your hands.- On my own 
world, I admit that what I did 
would have been most unjustified." 

Baley's long face was red with 
anger. "If they had recognized 
you as a robot — " 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



29 



"I was sure they wouldn't." 

"In any case, remember that 
you are a robot. Just a robot. 
Like those clerks in the shoe 
store." 

"But this is obvious." 

"And you're not human." Baley felt himself being driven into 
a wild cruelty almost against his 
will. 

"The division between human 
and robot is perhaps not as significant as that between intelligence and non-intelligence." 

"Maybe on your world, but not 
on Earth." Baley looked at his 
watch and shook his head angrily. 
He was an hour and a quarter 
late. He said curtly, "Let's go 
now. I've got to get you home." 

"You see, it is not proper to 
make any distinction of lesser 
meaning than the fact of intell — " 

Baley's voice rose. "All right! 
The subject is closed, Jessie is 
waiting for us." He walked in the 
direction of the nearest intrasection communi-tube. "I'd better call and tell her we're on our 
way up." 

"Jessie?" 

"My wife." 

Jehoshaphat, thought Baley, 
t I'm in a fine mood to face Jessie. 

CHAPTER IV 

TT had been her name that had 
first made Elijah Baley really 
conscious of Jessie. He had met 



her at the Section Christmas 
party back in '02, over a bowl 
of punch. He had just finished his 
schooling, just taken his first job 
with the City, just moved into one 
of the bachelor alcoves of Common Room 122A. 

She was handing out the punch. 
"I'm Jessie," she said. "Jessie 
Navodny. I don't know you." 

"Baley," he said, "Lije Baley. 
I'm new in the section." 

He took his punch and smiled 
mechanically. She impressed him 
as a cheerful and friendly person, 
so he stayed near her, watching 
the folks come and go, and sipping thoughtfully. 

"I helped make the punch." 
The girl's voice broke in upon 
him. "I can guarantee it. Do you 
want more?" 

Baley realized his glass was 
empty. He smiled and nodded. 

The girl's face was oval and 
not precisely pretty. Her dress 
was demure and conservative and 
she wore her light brown hair in 
a series of ringlets over her forehead. 

She joined him in the next 
drink and he felt better. 

"Jessie," he said, feeling the 
name with his tongue. "It's nice. 
Do you mind if I use it when, I'm 
talking to you." 

"If you want to. Do you know 
what it's short for?" 

"Jessica?" 

"You'll never guess." 



30 




 



"I can't think of anything 

else." 

She laughed and said archly, 
"My full name is Jezebel." 

That was when his interest 
flared. He put his punch glass 
down and said intently. "No, 
really?" 

"I'm not kidding. Jezebel. It's 
my real-for-true name on all my 
records. My parents liked the 
sound of it." 

She was quite proud of it, even 
though there was never a less 
likely Jezebel. 

Baley said seriously, "My name 
is Elijah, you know. My full 
name. I mean." 

It didn't register with her. 

He said, "Elijah was Jezebel's 
great enemy." 

"He was? 1 ' 

"Why, sure. In the Bible." 

"Oh? I didn't know that. Now 
isn't that funny? I hope that 
doesn't mean you'll have to be 
my enemy in real life." 

T^ROM the very beginning, 
there was no question of that. 
It was the coincidence of names 
at first that made her more than 
just a pleasant girl at the punchbowl. But afterward he had 
grown to find her cheerful, tender-hearted and finally, by some 
queer alchemy of the spirit, even 
pretty. He appreciated her cheerfulness particularly. His own sardonic view of life needed the 



antidote of cheerfulness. 

But Jessie never seemed to 
mind his long grave face. 

"Oh, goodness," she said, "what 
if you do look like a sour lemon? 
I know you're not really, and I 
guess if you were always grinning away like clockwork, the 
way I do, we'd just explode when 
we got together. You stay the 
way you are. Lije, and keep me 
from floating away." 

And she kept Lije Baley from 
sinking down. He applied for a 
small Couples apartment and got 
a contingent admission pending 
marriage. He showed it to her 
and said. "Will you fix it so I 
can get out of Bachelor's, Jessie? 
I don't like it there." 

Maybe it wasn't the most romantic proposal in the world, but 
Jessie said yes. 

Baley could only remember 
one time when Jessie's habitual 
cheer deserted her completely and 
that, too, had involved her name. 
It was in their first year of marriage — in fact the very month 
in which Bentley was conceived. 
(Their I.Q. rating. Genetic Values status, and Baley's position 
in the Department entitled him to 
two children, of which the first 
might be conceived during the 
first year.) Maybe, as Baley 
thought back upon it, that might 
have had something to do with it. 

Jessie had been drooping a bit 
because of Baley's consistent ov


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



31 



ertime hours of work. 

She said, "It's embarrassing to 
eat alone at the Kitchen every 
night." 

Baley was out of sorts. He said, 
"Why should it be? You can meet 
some nice single fellows there." 

And of course she promptly 
fired up. "You think I can't make 
an impression on them?" 

Maybe it was just because he 
was tired; maybe because Julius 
Enderby, a classmate of his, had 
moved up another notch on the 
C-scale rating while he himself 
had not. Maybe it was simply because he was a little tired of 
having her try to act up to the 
name she bore when she was 
nothing of the sort and never 
could be. 

In any case, he said bitingly, 
"I suppose you can, but I don't 
think you'll try. I wish you'd 
forget your name and be yourself." 

"I'll be just what I please." 

"Trying to be Jezebel won't 
get you anywhere. If you must 
know the truth, the name doesn't 
mean what you think, anyway. 
The Jezebel of the Bible was a 
faithful wife." 

JESSIE stared angrily at him. 
"That isn't so. I've heard the 
phrase, 'a painted Jezebel.' I 
know what that means." 

"Maybe you think you do, but 
you're wrong. After Jezebel's hus


band. King Ahab, died, her son 
Jehoram became king. One of 
the captains of his army, Jehu, 
rebelled against him and assassinated him. Jehu then rode to 
Jezreel where the old queenmother, Jezebel, was residing. 
Jezebel knew that he meant to 
kill her. In her pride and courage, she painted her face and 
dressed herself in her best clothes 
so that she could meet him as a 
haughty and defiant queen. He 
had her thrown from the window 
of the palace and killed, but she 
made a good end according to my 
notions. And that's what people 
refer to when they speak of a 
'painted Jezebel,' whether they 
know it or not." 

The next evening Jessie said in 
a small voice, "I've been reading 
the Bible. Lije." 

"What?" For a moment, Baley 
was bewildered. 

"The parts about Jezebel." 

"Oh! Jessie, I'm sorry if I hurt 
your feelings. I was being childish." 

"No. No." She pushed his hand 
from her waist and sat on the 
couch, cool and upright, with a 
definite space between them. "It's 
good to know the truth. I don't 
want to be fooled by not knowing. So I read about her. She was 
a wicked woman, Lije." 

"Well, her enemies wrote those 
chapters. We don't know her 
side." 



32 




 



"She killed all the prophets of 
the Lord that she could lay her 
hands on." 

"So they say." Baley felt about 
for a stick of chewing gum. He 
later abandoned that habit because Jessie said that with his 
long face and sad, brown eyes, 
it made him look like an old cow 
stuck with an unpleasant wad of 
grass it couldn't swallow and 
wouldn't spit out. 

He said, "If you want her side. 
I could think of some arguments 
for you. She followed the religion 
of her ancestors who had been in 
the land long before the Hebrews 
came. The Hebrews had their 
own God and, what's more, he 
was a jealous God. It wasn't 
enough for them to worship Him; 
everyone else had to worship Him 
as well. 

"Jezebel was a conservative, 
defending the old beliefs against 
the new ones. After all, even if 
the new beliefs had higher moral 
values, the old ones were more 
satisfying emotionally. The fact 
that she killed priests just marks 
her as a person of her times. It 
was the usual missionary method 
in those days. If you read I 
Kings, you must remember that 
Elijah (my namesake this time) 
had a contest with eight hundred and fifty prophets of Baal 
to see which could bring down 
fire from heaven. Elijah won and 
promptly ordered the crowd of 



onlookers to kill the eight hundred and fifty Baalites. And they 
did." 

^HE bit her lip. "What about 
^ Naboth's vineyard, Lije? Here 
was this Naboth not bothering 
anybody, except that he refused 
to sell the King his vineyard. So 
Jezebel arranged to have people 
perjure themselves and say that 
Naboth had committed blasphemy or something." 

"He was supposed to have 
'blasphemed God and the king.' " 
said Baley. 

"Yes. So they confiscated his 
property after they executed 
him." 

"That wasn't considered wrong 
then. In modern times, if the 
City or even if one of the 
Medieval nations had wanted 
Naboth's property, the courts 
would have ordered him off. had 
him removed by force if necessary, and paid him whatever they 
considered a fair price. King 
Ahab didn't have that kind of 
legal solution. He was sick and 
unhappy over the situation and 
Jezebel felt that her husband's 
welfare came ahead of Naboth's. 
I keep telling you, she was the 
model of a faithful wi — " 

Jessie flung herself away from 
him. "I think you're mean and 
spiteful." 

He looked at her with complete dismay. "What have I 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



33 



done? What's the matter with 
you?" 

She left the apartment without 
answering and spent the evening 
and half the night at the subetheric video levels, traveling 
petulantly from showing to showing and using up a two-month 
supply of her quota allowance 
(and her husband's). 

When she came back to a 
still wakeful Lije Baley, she had 
nothing further to say to him. 

It occurred to Baley later, 
much later, that he had smashed 
an important part of Jessie's life. 
Her name had signified something wicked and licentious to 
her. It was a delightful makeweight for her prim, respectable 
nature. It gave her an aroma. of 
vice and she adored that. 

But it was gone. She never 
mentioned her full name again, 
not to Lije, not to her friends 
and maybe, for all Baley knew, 
not even to herself. She was 
Jessie and took to signing her 
name so. 

A S the days passed, she began 
speaking to him again arid 
after a week or so, their relationship was on the old friendly 
footing and with all subsequent 
quarrels, nothing ever reached 
that one bad spot of intensity. 

Only once was there even an 
indirect reference to the matter. It 
was in her eighth month of preg


nancy. She had left her own 
position as dietitian's assistant in 
Section Kitchen A-23 and, with 
unaccustomed time on her hands, 
was amusing herself in speculation and preparation for the 
baby's birth. 

She said, one evening, "What 
about Bentley?" 

"Pardon me, dear?" said Baley, 
looking up from a sheaf of work 
he had brought home with him. 
(With an additional mouth to 
feed and Jessie's pay stopped 
and his own promotions to the 
non-clerical levels as far off, 
seemingly, as ever, extra work 
was necessary.) 

"I mean if the baby's a boy, 
what about Bentley as a name?" 

Baley pulled down the corners 
of his mouth. "Bentley Baley? 
Don't you think the names are 
too similar?" 

"I don't know. It has a swing, 
I think. Besides, the child can 
always pick out a middle name 
to suit himself when he gets 
older." 

"Well, it's all right with me." 

"Are you sure? I mean—maybe you wanted him to be named 
Elijah." 

"And be called Junior? I don't 
think that's a good idea. Jie can 
name his son Elijah, if he wants 
to." 

Then Jessie said, "There's just 
one thing," and stopped. 

After an interval, he looked up. 



34 




 



"What one thing?" 

She was red and she did not 
quite meet his eye, but she said, 
forcefully enough, "Bentley isn't 
a Bible name, is it?" 

"No," said Baley, "I'm quite 
sure it isn't." 

"All right, then. I don't want 
any Bible names." 

And that was the only harking 
back that took place from that 
time to the day when Elijah 
Baley was coming home with 
Robot Daneel Olivaw, when he 
had been married for more than 
eighteen years and when his son 
Bentley Baley (middle name still 
unchosen) was past sixteen. 

T>ALEY paused before the large 
" double door on which there 
glowed in large letters : PERSONAL—MEN. In smaller letters were written : Subsections 
1A — IE. In still smaller letters, 
just above the key-slit, it stated: 
"In Case of Loss of Key, Communicate at Once with 27-10151." 

A man inched past them, inserted an aluminum sliver into 
the key-slit and walked in. He 
closed the door behind him, making no attempt to hold it open 
for Baley. Had he done so, Baley 
would have been seriously offended. By custom, men disregarded 
one another's presence entirely 
either within or just outside the 
Personals. 



One of the more interesting 
postmarital confidences was Jessie's telling him that the situation was quite different at 
Women's Personals. It was one of 
the penalties of civic advancement that when the Baleys were 
granted permission for a small 
washbowl in their bedroom, Jessie's social life suffered. 

Baley said, without completely 
masking his embarrassment, 
"Please wait out here, Daneel." 

"Do you intend washing?" 
asked R. Daneel. 

Baley squirmed and thought: 
Damned robot ! If they were 
briefing him on everything under 
steel, why didn't they teach him 
manners? I'll be responsible if 
he ever says anything like this to 
anyone else. 

He said, "I'll shower. It gets 
crowded evenings. I'll lose time 
then. If I get it done now, we'll 
have the whole evening before 
us." 

R. Daneel's face maintained its 
repose. "Is it part of the social 
custom that I wait outside?" 

Baley's embarrassment deepened. "Why need you go in for — 
for no purpose?" 

"Oh, I understand you. Yes, of 
course. Nevertheless, Elijah, my 
hands grow dirty, too, and I will 
wash them." 

He indicated his palms, holding 
them out before him. They were 
pink and plump, with the proper 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



35 



creases. They bore every mark of 
excellent and meticulous workmanship and were as clean as 
need be. 

Baley said, "We have a washbasin in the apartment, you 
know." He said it casually. Snobbery would be lost on a robot. 

"Thank you for your kindness. 
On the whole, however, I think it 
would be preferable to make use 
of this place. If I am to live with 
you men of Earth, it is best that 
I adopt as many of your customs and attitudes as I can." 

"Come on in, then." 

The bright cheerfulness of the 
interior was a sharp contrast to 
the busy utilitarianism of most of 
the rest of the City, but it was all 
a blank on Baley's saturated 
retina. 

He whispered to Daneel, "I 
may take half an hour or so. 
Wait for me." He started away, 
then returned to add, "And don't 
talk to anybody and don't look 
at anybody. It's a custom." 

He looked hurriedly about to 
make certain that his own small 
conversation had not been noted, 
was not being met by secret 
shocked glances. Nobody, fortun•ately was in the ante -corridor, 
and after all, it was only the antecorridor. 

TTE hurried past the common 
chambers to the private 
stalls. It had been five years now 



since he had been awarded one — 
large enough to contain a shower, 
a small laundry and other necessities. It even had a small projector that could be keyed in for 
the news films. 

"A home away from home," he 
had joked when it was first made 
available to him. But now he 
often wondered how he would 
ever bear the adjustment back 
to the more Spartan existence of 
the common chambers if his stallprivileges were ever canceled. 

He pressed the button that 
activated the laundry and the 
smooth face of the meter lighted. 

R. Daneel was waiting patiently when Baley returned with a 
scrubbed body, clean underwear, 
a freshened shirt and, generally, 
a feeling of greater comfort. 

"No trouble?" Baley asked, 
when they were well outside the 
door and able to talk. 

"None at all, Elijah," said R. 
Daneel. 

Jessie was at the door, smiling 
nervously, when they arrived. 
Baley kissed her. 

"Jessie," he mumbled, "this is 
my new partner, Daneel Olivaw." 

Jessie held out a hand, which 
R. Daneel took and released. She 
turned to her husband, then 
looked timidly at R. Daneel. 

She said, "Won't you sit down. 
Mr. Olivaw? I must talk to my 
husband about some family matters. It'll take just a minute. I 



36 




 



hope you won't mind." 

Her hand was on Baley's sleeve. 
He followed her into the next 
room. 

She said, in a hurried whisper, 
"You aren't hurt, are you? I've 
been so worried ever since the 
broadcast." 

"What broadcast?" 

"About the riot at the shoe 
counter. They said two plainclothesmen stopped it. I knew 
you were coining home with a 
partner and this was right in our 
sub-section and just when you 
were coming home and I thought 
they were making it sound better 
than it was and you were — " 

"Please, Jessie. You see I'm 
perfectly all right." 

Jessie caught hold of herself 
with an effort. She said, shakily, 
"Your partner isn't from your 
division, is he?" 

"No," replied Baley miserably. 
"He's— a complete stranger." 

"How do I treat him?" 

"Like anybody else. He's just 
my partner, that's all." 

He said it so unconvincingly 
that Jessie's quick eyes narrowed. 
"What's wrong?" 

"Nothing. Come, let's go back 
into the "living room. It'll begin 
to look queer." 

T IJE Baley felt a little uncertain about the apartment 
now, though he had always been 
proud of it. It had three large 



rooms; the living room, for instance, was an ample fifteen feet 
by eighteen. There was a closet 
in each room. One of the main 
ventilation ducts passed directly 
by. It meant a rumbling noise, 
but, on the other hand, assured 
first-rate temperature control and 
well -conditioned air. Nor was the 
apartment far from either Personal, which was a prime convenience. 

But with the creature from 
worlds beyond space sitting in the 
midst of it, the apartment suddenly seemed cramped. 

Jessie said, with a gaiety that 
was slightly synthetic, "Have you 
and Mr. Olivaw eaten, Lije?" 

"As a matter of fact," said 
Baley quickly, "Daneel will not 
be eating with us. I will, though." 

Jessie accepted the situation 
without question. With food supplies so narrowly controlled, it 
was good form to refuse hospitality. 

She said, "I hope you won't 
mind our eating, Mr. Olivaw. 
Lije, Bentley and I generally eat 
at the Community Kitchen. 
There's more variety, and just 
between you and me, bigger helpings, too. But Lije and I do have 
permission to eat in our apartment three times a week if we 
want to — Lije is quite successful 
at the Bureau and we have very 
nice status — and I thought that 
just for this occasion, if you 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



37 



wanted to join us, we would have 
a little private feast of our own, 
though I do think that people 
who overdo their privacy privileges are anti -social." 

R. Daneel listened' politely. 

Baley said, with an undercover "shushing" wiggle of his 
fingers, "Jessie, I'm hungry." 

"Would I be breaking a custom, Mrs. Baley, if I addressed 
you by your given name?" R. 
Daneel asked. 

"Why, no, of course not" Jessie folded a table out of the wall 
and plugged the plate warmer 
into the central depression on the 
tabletop. "You go right ahead 
and call me Jessie all you like — 
uh— Daneel." She giggled. 

Baley was getting rapidly more 
uncomfortable. Jessie thought R. 
Daneel a man. The situation 
would be something to boast of 
and talk about in Women's Personal, He was good-looking in a 
wooden way, too, and Jessie was 
pleased with his deference. Anyone could see that. 

Baley wondered what R. 
Daneel thought of Jessie. She 
hadn't changed much in eighteen 
years, or at least not to Baley. 
She was heavier, of course, and 
her figure had lost its youthful 
vigor. But that's all beside the 
point, thought Baley somberly. 
On the Outer Worlds, the women 
were supposedly tall and as slim 
and regal as the men and those 



must be the kind of women R. 
Daneel was used to. 

But R. Daneel seemed quite 
unperturbed by Jessie's conversation, her appearance or her appropriation of his name. He said, 
"Are you sure that is proper? 
The name, Jessie, seems to be a 
diminutive. Perhaps its use is 
restricted to members of your 
immediate circle and I would be 
more proper if I used your full 
given name." 

Jessie, breaking open the insulating wrapper on the dinner 
ration, bent her head in sudden 
concentration. 

"Just Jessie," she said tightly. 

"Very well, Jessie." 

THE door opened and a youngster entered cautiously. His 
eyes found R. Daneel almost at 
once. 

"My son Bentley," said Baley. 
"This is Mr. Olivaw, Ben." 

"He's your partner, huh, Dad? 
How d'ye do, Mr. Olivaw." Ben's 
eyes grew large and luminous. 
"Say, Dad, what happened down 
in the shoe place? The newscast 
said — " 

"Don't ask any questions now, 
Ben." 

Bentley's face fell and he looked toward his mother, who motioned him to a seat. 

"Did you do what I told you, 
Bentley?" she asked, when he sat 
down. His hair was as dark as 



38 




 



his father's and he was going to 
have his father's height, but he 
had Jessie's oval face, her hazel 
eyes, her light-hearted way of 
looking at life. 

"Sure, Mom," said Bentley, 
hitching himself forward a bit to 
look into the double dish from 
which savory vapors were already 
rising. "What wc got to eat? Not 
zymoveal again, Mom? Huh, 
Mom?" 

"There's nothing wrong with 
zymoveal," said Jessie, her lips 
pressing together. "Now you just 
eat what's put before you and 
let's not have any comments." 

It was quite obvious they were 
having zymoveal. 

Baley took his own seat. He 
himself would have preferred 
something other than zymoveal, 
with its sharp flavor and definite 
aftertaste, but Jessie had explained her problem before this. 

"Well, I just can't, Lije," she 
had said. "I live right here on 
these levels all day and I can't 
make enemies or life wouldn't be 
bearable. They know I used to 
be assistant dietitian and if . I 
just walked off with steak or 
chicken every other week, when 
there's hardly any one else on the 
floor that has private eating privileges even just on Sunday, they'd 
say it was pull or friends in the 
prep -room. It would be talk, 
talk, talk, and I wouldn't be able 
to put my nose out the door or 



visit Personal in peace. As it is, 
zymoveal and protoveg are very 
good. They're well-balanced 
nourishment with no waste and, 
as a matter of fact, they're full of 
vitamins and minerals and everything anyone needs and we can 
have all the chicken we want 
when we eat in Community on 
the chicken Tuesdays." 

Baley gave in easily. It was as 
Jessie said — the first problem of 
living is to minimize resentment 
from the crowds that surround 
you on all sides. Bentley was a 
little harder to convince. 

TTE said, "Gee, Mom, why can't 
1 use Dad's ticket and eat in 
Community myself? I'd just as 
soon." 

Jessie shook her head in annoyance and said, "I'm surprised 
at you, Bentley. What would 
people say if they saw you eating by yourself as though your 
own family weren't good enough 
for you or had thrown you out 
of the apartment?" 

"Well, gosh, it's none of people's business." 

Baley said, with a nervous edge 
in his voice. "Do as your mother 
tells you, Bentley." 

Bentley shrugged unhappily. 

R. Daneel said suddenly, from 
the other side of the room, "Have 
I the family's permission to view 
these book -films during your 
meal?" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



39 



"Oh, sure," said Bentley, slipping away froi*i the table, a look 
of instant inter; est upon his face. 
"They're mine^ I got them from 
the library on special school permit. I'll get you my viewer. Ifs 
a pretty good one. Dad gave it 
to me for my l^st birthday." 

He brought it to R. Daneel 
and asked, "Are you interested in 
robots, Mr. OJivaw?" 

Baley abruptly dropped his 
spoon and bent to pick it up. 

R. Daneel ssdd, "Yes, Bentley. 
I am quite interested." 

"Then you'll like these. They're 
all about robots. I've got to write 
an essay on them for school, so 
I'm doing research. It's quite a 
complicated subject," he explained importantly. "I'm against 
them myself." 

"Sit down, Bentley," said 
Baley unhappily, "and don't 
bother Mr. Olivaw." 

"He's not bothering me, Elijah. 
I'd like to tall* to you about the 
problem another time, Bentley. 
Your father a n d I will be very 
busy tonight." 

"Thanks, M*. Olivaw." Bentley 
took his seat $md with a look of 
accusation in Ins mother's direction, cut off a portion of the pink 
zymoveal with his fork. 

Baley thought: Busy tonight? 

Then, with at resounding shock, 
he remember-ed his job. He 
thought of a Spacer lying dead 
in Spacetown and realized that, 



for hours, he had been so involved with his own deadly dilemma that he had forgotten the 
cold fact of murder. 

CHAPTER V 

JESSIE said good-by to them. 
She was wearing a formal hat 
and a little jacket of keratofiber 
as she said, "I hope you'll excuse 
me, Mr. Olivaw. I know you have 
a great deal to discuss with Lije." 

She pushed her son ahead of 
her after she opened the door. 

"When will you be back, Jessie?" asked Baley. 

She paused. "When do you 
want me to be back?" 

"Well, no use staying out all 
night. Why don't you come back 
your usual time? Midnight or 
so." He looked doubtfully at R. 
Daneel. 

R. Daneel nodded. "I regret 
having to drive you from your 
home." 

"Don't worry about that, Mr. 
Olivaw. This is my usual evening 
out with the girls, anyway. Come 
on, Ben." 

The youngster was rebellious. 
"Aw, why the dickens do I have 
to go? I'm not going to bother 
them. Yeast!" 

"Now do as I say." 

"Well, why can't I go to the 
etherics along with you?" 

"Because I'm going with some 
friends and you've got other 



40 




 



things — n The door closed behind 
them. 

The moment had come. Baley 
had put it off in his mind. He 
had thought: First let's meet the 
robot and see what he's like. 
Then it was: Let's get him home. 
And then: Lefs eat. 

But now there was no excuse 
for further delay. It was down 
at last to the question of murder, 
of interstellar complications, of 
possible raises in ratings, of possible disgrace and declassification. And he had no way of even 
beginning except to turn to the 
robot for help. 

His fingernails moved aimlessly on the table, which had not 
been returned to its wall recess. 

R. Daneel said, "How secure 
are we against being overheard?" 

Baley looked up, surprised. 
"No one would listen to what's 
going on in another man's apartment." 

"It is not your custom to 
eavesdrop?" 

"You might as well suppose 
they'd — I don't know — that 
they'd look in your plate while 
you're eating." 

"Or that they would commit 
murder?" 

"What?" 

"It is against your customs to 
kill, is it not, Elijah?" 

Baley felt anger rising. "See 
here, if we're going to be partners, 
don't try to imitate Spacer arro


gance. There's no room for it in 
you, R. Daneel." He could not 
resist emphasizing the "R." 

"I am sorry if I have hurt your 
feelings, Elijah. My intention was 
only to indicate that, since human beings are occasionally capable of murder in defiance of 
custom, they may be able to violate custom for the smaller impropriety of eavesdropping." 

"The apartment is adequately 
insulated," said Baley, still irritated. "You haven't heard anything from the apartments on 
any side of us, have you? Well, 
they won't hear us, either. Besides, why should anvone think 
anything of importance is going 
on here?** 

"We must not underestimate 
the enemy." 

T>ALEY shrugged. "Let's get 
started. My information is* 
sketchy, so I can lay out my 
hand without much trouble. I 
know that a man named Roj 
Nemennuh Sarton, a citizen of 
the planet Aurora and a resident 
of Spacetown, has been murdered 
by person or persons unknown. I 
understand that it is the opinion 
of the Spacers that this is not an 
isolated event. Am I right?" 

"You are entirely right, Elijah." 

"They tie it up with recent attempts to sabotage the Spacersponsored project of converting 
us to an integrated human/robot 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



41 



society on the model of the Outer 
Worlds, and assume the murder 
was the product of a well-organized terrorist group." 
"Yes." 

"Then to begin with, is this 
Spacer theory necessarily true? 
Why can't the murder have been 
the work of an isolated fanatic? 
There is strong anti-robot sentiment on Earth, but there are no 
organized parties advocating violence of this sort." 

"Not openly, perhaps." 

"Even a group conspiring to 
destroy robots and robot-factories would have the common 
sense to realize that the worst 
thing they could do would be to 
murder a Spacer. It seems much 
more likely to have been the work 
of an unbalanced mind." 

R. Daneel thought carefully, 
then said, "I think the weight of 
probability is against the 'fanatic' 
theory. The person killed was too 
well-chosen and the time of the 
murder too appropriate for anything but deliberate planning." 

"Well, then, you've got more 
information than I have. Spill it!" 

"Your phraseology is obscure, 
but I think I understand. I will 
have to explain some of the background to you. As seen from 
Spacetown, Elijah, relations with 
Earth are unsatisfactory." 

"Tough," muttered Baley cold
ly. 

"I have been told that when 



Spacetown was first established, 
most of our people assumed 
Earth would be willing to adopt 
the integrated society that has 
worked so well on the Outer 
Worlds. Even after the first riots, 
we thought that it was only a 
matter of your people getting 
over the first shock of novelty. 
That has not proven to be the 
case. Even with the cooperation 
of the Terrestrial government and 
of most of the various City governments, resistance has been 
continuous and progress has been 
very slow. Naturally, this has 
been a matter of great concern 
to our people." 

"Out of altruism, I suppose." 

"Not entirely," said R. Daneel, 
"although it is good of you to 
attribute worthy motives to them. 
It is our common belief that a 
healthy and modernized Earth 
would be of great benefit to the 
whole Galaxy. At least it is the 
common belief among our people 
at Space town. I must admit that 
there are strong elements opposed 
to them on the Outer Worlds." 

"What? Disagreement among 
the Spacers?" 

"Certainly. There are some who 
think that a modernized Earth 
will be a dangerous empire building Earth. This is particularly true among the populations 
of those older worlds. They are 
closer to Earth and have greater 
reason to remember the first few 



42 




 



centuries of interstellar travel 
when their worlds were controlled, politically and economically, by Earth," 

T IJE Baley sighed. "Ancient 
^ history. Are they really worried? Are they still sore at us for 
things that happened a thousand 
years ago?" 

"Humans," said R. Daneel, 
"have their own peculiar makeup. They are not as reasonable, 
in many ways, as robots, since 
their circuits are more reactive 
than logical. I am told that this, 
too, has its advantages." 

"Perhaps it may," said Baley 
drily. 

"You are in a better position 
to know. In any case, continuing 
failure on Earth has strengthened the Nationalist parties on 
the Outer Worlds. They say it is 
obvious that Earthmen are different from Spacers and that if we 
imposed robots on Earth by superior force, we would be loosing 
destruction on the Galaxy. 
Earth's population is eight billions, while the total population 
of the fifty Outer Worlds combined is scarcely more than five 
and a half billions. Our people 
here, particularly Dr. Sarton — " 

"He was a doctor?" 

"A Doctor of Sociology, specializing in robotics, and a very 
brilliant man." 

"I see. Go on." 



"Dr. Sarton felt that the time 
had come to make a supreme 
effort to understand the psychology of the Earthman. It is easy 
to say that your people are innately conservative and to speak 
tritely of 'the unchanging Earth' 
and 'the inscrutable Terrestrial 
mind/ but Dr. Sarton said we 
could not dismiss the Earthman 
with a proverb or a bromide. He 
claimed the Spacers who were 
trying to remake Earth must 
abandon the isolation of Spacetown and mingle with Earthmen. 
They must live as they, think as 
they, be as they." 

Baley said, "The Spacers? Impossible." 

"You are quite right," agreed 
R. Daneel. "Despite his views, 
Dr. Sarton himself could not have 
brought himself to enter any of 
the Cities and he knew it. He 
would have been unable to bear 
the noise and rush of the crowds. 
Even if he had been forced inside 
at the point of a blaster, the turmoil would have distracted him 
so that he could never have 
penetrated the truths for which 
he sought." 

"What about the way they're 
always worrying about disease?" 
demanded Baley. "Don't forget 
that. I don't think there's one of 
them who would risk entering a 
City for that reason alone." 

"There is that, too. Disease in 
the Earthly sense is unknown 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



43 



on the Outer Worlds and the fear 
of the unknown is always morbid. 
Dr. Sarton appreciated all of this 
and, nevertheless, he insisted on 
the necessity of growing to know 
the Earthman and his' way of life 
intimately." 

"He seems to have worked himself into a corner/' 

"Not quite. The objections to 
entering the City hold for human 
Spacers. Robot Spacers are another thing entirely." 

TJALEY thought: I keep forgetting, damn it. Aloud, he 
said, "Oh?" 

"Yes," said R. Daneel. "We 
can be designed for adaptation to 
Earthly conditions. We could be 
accepted by Earthmen and allowed a closer view of their life." 

"And you yourself — " began 
Baley in sudden enlightenment. 

"Am just such? a robot. For a 
year, Dr. Sarton has been working upon the design and construction. I was the first of his 
robots and so far the only one. 
Unfortunately, my education is 
not yet complete. I have been 
hurried into my role prematurely 
as a result of the murder." 

• "Then not all Spacer robots are 
like you? I mean some look more 
like robots and less like humans. 
Right?" 

"Why, naturally. The outward 
appearance is dependent on a 
robot's function. My own func


tion requires a very manlike appearance. Others are different, 
although all are humanoid. Certainly they are more humanoid 
than the primitive models I saw 
at the shoe counter. Are all your 
robots being manufactured like 
that?" 

"More or less," said Baley. 
"You don't approve?" 

"It is difficult to accept a gross 
parody of the human form as an 
intellectual equal. Can your factories do no better?" 

"I'm sure they can, Daneel. I 
think we just prefer to know 
when we're dealing with a robot 
and when we're not." He stared 
directly into the robot's eyes as 
he said that. They were bright 
and moist, as a human's would 
be, but it seemed to Baley that 
their gaze was steady and did not 
flicker slightly from point to 
point as a man's would. 

R. Daneel said, "I am hopeful 
that in time I will grow to understand that point of view." 

For an instant, Baley thought 
there was sarcasm in the remark, 
then dismissed the possibility. 
The robot was undoubtedly being quite sincere. 

"In any case," said R. Daneel, 
"Dr. Sarton saw clearly the fact 
that it was a case for C/Fe." 
"What's that?" 

"Just the chemical symbols for 
the elements carbon and iron, 
Elijah. Carbon is the basis of 


 



human life, and iron of robot 
life. It becomes easy to speak of 
C/Fe when you wish to express 
a culture that combines the best 
of the two on an equal but parallel basis." 

"See fee. Do you write it with 
a hyphen or how?" 

"No, Elijah. A diagonal line 
between the two is the accepted 
way. It symbolizes neither one 
nor the other, but a mixture of 
the two, without priority." 

A GAINST his will, Baley found 
himself interested. Formal 
education on Earth included virtually no information on Outer 
World history or sociology after 
the Great Rebellion that made 
them independent of the mother 
planet. The popular book- film 
romances, to be sure, had their 



stock Outer World characters: 
the visiting tycoon, choleric and 
eccentric; the beautiful heiress, 
invariably smitten by the Earthman's charms; the arrogant 
Spacer rival, wicked and forever 
beaten. These were worthless 
sources, since Spacers never entered Cities and Spacer women 
virtually never visited Earth. 

For the first time in his life, 
Baley was stirred by an odd curiosity. What was Spacer life really 
like? 

He said, "I think I get what 
you're driving at. Your Dr. Sarton was attacking the problem 
of Earth's conversion to C/Fe 
from a new and promising angle. 
Our conservative groups — Medievalists, as they call themselves — 
were perturbed. They were afraid 
he might succeed. So they killed 




THE CAVES OF STEEL 



45 



him. That's the motivation that 
makes ' it an organized plot and 
not an isolated outrage. Right?" 
"Quite right." 

BaleV whistled thoughtfully 
under his breath. His long fingers 
tapped lightly against the table. 
Then he shook his head. "It won't 
wash. It won't wash at all." 

"I do not understand." 

"An Earthman walks into 
Spacetown, walks up to Dr. Sarton, blasts him, and walks out. 
But the entrance to Spacetown is 
guarded." 

R, Daneel nodded. "No Earthman can possibly have passed 
through the entrance illegally." 

"Then where does that leave 
you?" 

"It would leave us in a confusing position, Elijah, if the entrance- were the only way of 
reaching Spacetown from New 
York City." 

Baley watched his partner 
thoughtfully. "I don't get you. 
It's the only connection between 
the two." 

"Directly between the two, 
yes. May I have a piece of paper 
and a writer? Thank you. Look, 
partner Elijah. I will draw a big 
circle and label it 'New York 
City.' Now, tangent to it. I will 
draw a small circle and label it 
'Spacetown.' Here, where they 
touch. I draw an arrowhead and 
label it 'Barrier.' Now do you see 
no other connection?" 



Baley said, "Of course not. 
There is no other connection." 

"In a way, I am glad to hear 
you say this. It is in accordance 
with what I have been taught 
about terrestrial ways of thinking. The Barrier is the only direct 
connection. But both the City 
and Spacetown are open to the 
countryside in all directions. It is 
possible for a Terrestrial to leave 
the City at any of numerous exits 
and strike out cross-country to 
Spacetown, where no Barrier will 
stop him." 

THE tip of Baley's tongue 
touched his upper lip and for 
a moment stayed there. Then he 
said, "Cross-country?" 
"Yes." 

" Cross -country! Alone?" 
"Why not?" 
"Walking?" 

"That would offer the least 
chance of detection. The murder 
took place early in the working 
day and the trip was undoubtedly negotiated before dawn." 

"Impossible! There isn't a man 
in the City who would do it. 
Leave the City? Alone?" 

"Ordinarily, it would seem unlikely. We Spacers know that, 
It is why we guard only the entrance. Even in the Great Riot, 
your people attacked only at the 
Barrier that then protected the 
entrance. Not one left the City." 

"Well, then?" 



46 




 



"Now we are dealing with an 
unusual situation. It is not the 
blind attack of a mob following 
the line of least resistance, but 
the organized attempt of a small 
group to strike deliberately at the 
unguarded point. It explains why, 
as you say, a Terrestrial could 
enter Spacetown, walk up to his 
victim, kill him, and walk away. 
The man attacked through a 
complete blind spot on our part." 

Baley shook his head. "It's too 
unlikely. Have your people done 
anything to check that theory?" 

"Yes, we have. Your Commissioner of Police was present almost at the time of the murder — " 

"I know. He told me so." 

"That, Elijah, is another example of the timeliness of the 
murder. Your Commissioner has 
cooperated with Dr. Sarton in the 
past and he was the Earthman 
with whom Dr. Sarton planned 
to make initial arrangements for 
the infiltration of your City by 
robots such as myself. The appointment for that morning was 
to concern that. The murder, of 
course, stopped those plans, at 
least temporarily. The fact that 
it happened when your own Commissioner of Police was actually 
within Spacetown made the entire situation more difficult and 
embarrassing for Earth, and for 
our own people, too. 

"But that is not what I started 
to say. Your Commissioner was 



present. We said to him, 'The 
man must have come crosscountry.' Like you, he said, 
'Impossible' or perhaps 'Unthinkable.' He was quite disturbed, of 
course, and perhaps that may 
have made it difficult for him to 
see the essential point. Nevertheless, we forced him, to begin 
checking that possibility almost 
at once." 

T> ALEY thought of the Commissioner's broken glasses 
and, even in the middle of grim 
thoughts, a corner of his mouth 
twitched. Poor Julius ! Yes, he 
would be disturbed. There would 
be no way for Enderby to have 
explained the situation to the 
lofty Spacers, who looked upon 
physical disability as a peculiarly disgusting attribute of the nongenetically selected Earthmen. 
That is, he couldn't without losing face, and face was valuable 
to Police Commissioner Julius 
Enderby. Well, Earthmen had to 
stick together in some respects. 
The robot would never find out 
about Enderby's nearsightedness 
from Baley. 

R. Daneel continued, "One by 
one, the various exit points from 
the City were investigated. Do 
you know how many there are, 
Elijah?" 

Baley hazarded, "Twenty?" 

"Five hundred and two." 

"How many?" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



47 



"Originally, there were far 
more. Your City represents a 
slow growth, Elijah. It was once 
open to the sky and people 
crossed from City to country 
freely." 

"I know that." 

"Well, when it was first enclosed, there were many exits 
left. Five hundred and two still 
remain. The rest are built over 
or blocked up. We are not counting, of course, the entrance points 
for air-freight." 

"Well, what of the exit points?" 

"They are unguarded. We 
could find no official who was in 
charge or who considered them 
under his jurisdiction. A man 
could have walked out of any of 
them at any time and returned 
at will. He would never have 
been detected." 

"Anything else? The weapon 
was gone, I suppose." 

"Oh, yes." 

"Any clues of any sort?" 

"None. We have investigated 
the grounds surrounding Spacetown thoroughly. The robots on 
the truck farms were quite useless as possible witnesses. They 
were little more than automatic 
farm machinery; scarcely humanoid. And there were no 
humans." 

"TJh-huh. What next?" 

"Having failed, so far, at one 
end, Spacetown, we will work at 
the other, New York City. It 



will be our duty to track down all 
possible subversive groups, to sift 
all dissident organizations — " 

"How much time do you intend to spend?" interrupted 
Baley. 

"As little as possible, as much 
as necessary." 

"W7ELL," said Baley, thought *» fully, "I wish you had another partner in this mess." 

"I do not," said R. Daneel. 
"The Commissioner spoke very 
highly of your loyalty and ability." 

"It was nice of him," said Baley 
sardonically. He thought: Poor 
Julius. I*m on his conscience and 
he tries hard. 

"We didn't rely entirely on 
him," said R. Daneel. "We checked your records. You have expressed yourself openly against 
the use of robots in your department." 

"Oh? Do you object?" 

"Not at all. Your opinions are 
your own. But it made it necessary for us to check your psychological profile very closely. 
We know that although you dislike robots intensely, you will 
work with one if you conceive it 
to be your duty. You have an 
extraordinarily high loyalty index 
and a respect for legitimate authority. It is what we need. Commissioner Enderby judged you 
well." 



48 




 



"You have no personal resentment toward my anti-robot sentiments?" 

R. Daneel said, "If they do not 
prevent you from working with 
me and helping me do what is 
required of me, how can they 
matter?" 

Baley felt stopped. He said belligerently, "Well, then, if I pass 
the test, how about you? What 
makes you a detective?" 

"I do not understand you." 

"You were designed as an information-gathering machine. A 
man-imitation to record the facts 
of human life for the Spacers." 

"That is a good beginning for 
an investigator, is it not, to be 
an information-gathering machine?" 

"A beginning, maybe. But it's 
not all there is, by a long shot." 

"To be sure, there has been a 
final adjustment of my circuits." 

"I'd be curious to hear the details of that, Daneel." 

"That is easy enough. A particularly strong drive has been 
inserted into my motivation 
banks — a desire for justice." 

"Justice!" cried Baley. The 
irony faded from his face and 
was replaced by a look of the 
most earnest distrust. 

But R. Daneel turned swiftly in 
his chair and stared at the door. 
"Someone is out there." 

The door opened and Jessie, 
pale and thin-lipped, walked in. 



Startled, Baley explained, 
"Why, Jessie ! Is anything 
wrong?" 

She stood there, eyes not meeting his. "I'm sorry. I had to — " 
Her voice trailed off. 

"Where's Bentley?" 

"He's to stay the night in the 
Youth HfllL" 

"Why? I didn't tell you to do 
that." 

"You said your partner would 
stay the night. I felt he would 
«need Bentley's room.** 

R. Daneel said, "There was no 
necessity, Jessie." 

Jessie lifted her eyes to R. 
Daneel's face, staring at it earnestly. 

Baley looked at his fingertips, 
sick at what might follow, somehow unable to interpose. The 
momentary silence pressed thickly on his eardrums and then far 
away, as though through folds 
of plastex, he heard his wife say, 
"I think you are a robot, Daneel." 

And R. Daneel replied, in a 
voice as calm as ever, "I am." 

CHAPTER VI 

ON the uppermost levels of 
some of the wealthiest subsections of the City are the natural Solariums, where a partition 
of quartz with a movable metal 
shield excludes the air, but lets, 
in the sunlight There the wives 
and daughters of the City's high


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



49 



est administrators and executives 
may tan themselves. A unique 
thing happens there every evening. 

Night falls. 

In the rest of the -City (including the UV-Solariums, where the 
millions, in strict sequence of allotted time, might occasionally 
expose themselves to the artificial wavelengths of arc-lights) 
there are only the arbitrary cycles 
of hours. 

The business of the City might 
easily have continued in three 
eight-hour or four six-hour shifts, 
by "day" and "night" alike. Light 
and work could easily proceed 
endlessly. There were always 
civic reformers who periodically 
suggested such a filing in the 
interests of economy and efficiency. 

The notion was never accepted. 

Much of the earlier habits of 
Earthly society had been given 
up in the interests of that same 
economy and efficiency: space, 
privacy, even much of free will. 
They were the products of civilization, however, and not more 
than ten thousand years old. 

The adjustment of sleep to 
night, however, was as old as 
Man — a million years. Although 
the evening was unseen, apartment lights dimmed as the hours 
of darkness passed and the City's 
pulse sank. No one could have 
told noon from midnight by any 



cosmic phenomenon along the enclosed avenues of the City, yet 
mankind followed the mute partitionings of the hour-hand. 

The Expressways emptied, the 
noise of life fell, the moving mob 
among the colossal alleys melted 
away; New York City lay in 
Earth's unnoticed shadow, and its 
population slept. 

Elijah Baley did not sleep. He 
lay in bed and there was no light 
in his apartment, but that was 
as far as it went. 

Jessie lay next to him, motionless in the darkness. He had not 
felt nor heard her move. 

On the other side of the wall 
sat, stood, lay (Baley wondered 
which) R. Daneel Olivaw. 

Baley whispered, "Jessie!" 

The dark figure beside him 
stirred slightly under the sheet. 
"What do you want?" 

"Jessie, don't make it worse 
for me," 

"You might have told me." 

"How could I? I was planning 
to, when I could think of a way. 
Jehoshaphat, Jessie — " 

"Sh!" 

Baley's voice returned to its 
whisper. "How did you find out? 
Won't you tell me?" 

JESSIE turned toward him." He 
could sense her eyes looking 
through the darkness at him. 

"Lije." Her voice was scarcely 
more than a stirring of air. "Can 



50 




 



he hear us, do you think?" 

"Not if we whisper." 

"How do you know? Maybe 
he has special hearing to pick 
up tiny sounds. Spacer robots 
can do all sorts of things." 

Baley knew that the pro-robot 
propaganda was forever stressing 
the miraculous feats of the Spacer 
robots; their endurance, their extra senses, their service to humanity in a hundred novel ways. 
Personally, he thought that approach defeated itself. Earthmen 
hated the robots all the more for 
their superiority. 

He whispered, "Not Daneel. 
They wanted him to be accepted 
as a human being, so he must 
have only human senses." 

"How do you know?" 

"If he had extra senses, there 
would be too much danger of his 
giving himself away as nonhuman by accident. He would do 
too much, know too much." 

"Well, maybe." 

A minute passed and Baley 
tried a second time. "Jessie, if 
you'll just let things be until — 
until — Look, dear, it's unfair of 
you to be angry." 

"Angry? Oh, Lije, you fool! 
I'm not angry. I'm scared; I'm 
scared clean to death." 

For a while, they clung together, and Baley's growing sense 
of injury evaporated into a 
troubled concern. 

"Why, Jessie? There's nothing 



to be worried about. He's harmless. You know he can't hurt 
humans." 

"Can't you get rid of him, 
Lije?" 

"It's Department business. 
How can I?" 

"What kind of business, Lije? 
Tell me." 

"Now, Jessie, I'm surprised at 
you." He groped for her cheek 
in the darkness and patted it. It 
was wet. Using his pajama sleeve, 
he carefully wiped her eyes. 
"Now, look, you're being a baby." 

"Tell them at the Department 
to have someone else do it, whatever it is. Please, Lije." 

Baley's voice hardened a bit. 
"Jessie, you've been a policeman's 
wife long enough to know an 
assignment is an assignment." 

"Well, why did it have to be 
you?" 

"Julius Enderby — " 

She stiffened in his arms. "I 
might have known. Why can't 
you tell Julius Enderby to have 
someone else do the dirty work 
just once?" 

ENDERBY had been a fighting 
word with them since their 
engagement. He had been two 
classes ahead of Baley at the City 
School of Administrative Studies. 
They had been friends. When 
Baley had taken his battery of 
aptitude tests and neuroanalysis 
and found himself in line for the 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



51 



police force, Enderby was already 
there before him, Enderby had 
moved into the plainclothes division. 

Baley followed Enderby, but 
at a continually greater distance. 
Baley was capable enough, efficient enough, but he lacked 
something that Enderby had. 
Enderby fitted the administrative 
machine perfectly. He was one of 
those persons born for a bureaucracy. The Commissioner wasn't a 
great brain, and Baley knew it. 
He had his childish peculiarities, 
his intermittent rash of ostentatious Medievalism, for instance. 
But offended no one; he took 
orders grace r ully; he gave them 
with the proper mixture of gentleness and firmness. He even 
got along' with the Spacers, 
though perhaps too obsequious 
to them. (Baley himself could 
never have dealt with them for 
half a day without getting into a 
state of bristle; he was sure of 
that, even though he had never 
really spoken to a Spacer.) But 
they trusted Enderby and that 
made him extremely useful to 
the City. 

So, in a Civil Service where 
smooth and sociable performance 
was more useful than an individualistic competence, Enderby 
went up the scale quickly, and 
was at the Commissioner level 
when Baley was nothing more 
than a C-5. Baley did not resent 



the contrast, though he was human enough to regret it. Enderby 
did not forget their earlier friendship and, in his queer way, tried 
to make up for his success by 
doing what he could for Baley. 

The assignment of partnership 
with R. Daneel was one example. 
It was tough and unpleasant, but 
there was no question that it carried the promise of tremendous 
advancement. The Commissioner 
might have given the chance to 
someone else. His own talk, that 
morning, of needing a favor, 
masked but did not hide that 
fact. 

Jessie never saw things that 
way. On similar occasions in the 
past, she had said, "It's your silly 
loyalty index. I'm so tired of 
hearing everyone praise you for 
being so full of a sense of duty. 
Think of yourself once in a while. 
I notice the ones on top don't 
bring up the topic of their own 
loyalty index." 

Baley lay in bed in a state of 
stiff wakefulness, letting Jessie 
calm down. He had to think. He 
had to be certain of his suspicions. .Little things chased one 
another and fitted together in his 
mind. Slowly, they were building 
into a pattern, „ 

TIE felt the mattress give as 
Jessie stirred. 
"Lije?" Her lips were at his ear. 
"Why don't you resign?" 



52 




 



"Don't be crazy." 

"Why not?" She was suddenly 
almost eager. "You can get rid 
of that horrible robot that way. 
Just walk in and tell Enderby 
you're through." 

Baley said coldly, "I can't resign in the middle of an important case. I can't throw the 
whole thing down the disposal 
tube just any time I feel like it. 
A trick like that means declassification for cause." 

"You can work your way up 
again. You can do it, Lije." 

"Civil Service doesn't take 
men who are declassified for 
cause. Manual labor is the only 
thing I can do; the only thing 
you could do. Bentley would lose 
all inherited status. For God's 
sake, Jessie, you don't know what 
it's like." 

"I've read about it. I'm not 
afraid of it." 

"You're crazy. You're plain 
crazy." Baley could feel himself 
trembling. There was a familiar, 
flashing picture of his father in 
his mind's eye. His father, moldering away toward death. 

Jessie sighed heavily. 

Baley's mind turned savagely 
away from her. In desperation, 
it returned to the pattern it was 
constructing. 

He said tightly, "Jessie, you've 
got to tell me. How did you find 
out Daneel was a robot? What 
made you decide that?" 



She began, "Well — " and just 
ran down. It was the third time 
she had tried to explain and 
failed. 

He crushed her hand in his, 
willing her to speak. "Please, 
Jessie. What's frightening you?" 

She said, "I just guessed he 
was a robot, Lije." 

He said, "There wasn't anything to make you guess that, 
Jessie. You didn't think he was 
a robot before you left, now did 
you?" 

"No-o, but I got to thinking — " 
"Come on, Jessie. What was 
it?" 

"Well — the girls were talking 
in the Personal. You know how 
they are. Just talking about 
everything." 

Women! thought Baley. 

"Anyway," said Jessie. "The 
rumor is all over town. It must 
be." 

OALEY felt a quick and sav" age touch of triumph. Another piece in place! 

"All over town?" he repeated. 

"It was the way they sounded. 
They said there was talk about a 
Spacer robot loose in the City. 
He was supposed to look just like 
a man and to be working with the 
police. They even asked me 
about it. They laughed and said, 
'Does your Lije know anything 
about it, Jessie?' And I laughed 
and said, 'Don't be silly!' 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



53 



"Then we went to the etherics 
and I got to thinking about your 
new partner. Do you remember 
those pictures you brought home, 
the ones Julius Enderby took in 
Spacetown, to show me what 
Spacers looked like? Well, I got 
to thinking that's what your partner looked like. I said to myself, 
Oh, my God, someone must've 
recognized him in the shoe department and he's with Lije and 
I just said I had a headache and 
I ran — " 

Baley said, "Now, Jessie, get 
hold of yourself. You're not 
afraid of Daneel himself. You 
faced up to him when you came 
home." 

His teeth bit his last word in 
two. He sat up in bed, eyes uselessly wide in the darkness. 

He felt his wife move against 
his side. His hand leaped, found 
her lips and pressed against them. 
She heaved against his grip, her 
hands grasping his wrist and 
wrenching, but he leaned down 
against her still more heavily. 

Then, suddenly, he released 
her. She whimpered. 

He said huskily, "Sorry, Jessie. 
I was listening." 

He got out of bed, pulled 
warm Plastofilm over the soles 
of his feet. 

"Lije, where are you going? 
Don't leave me." 

"It's all right. I'm just going 
to the door." 



The Plastofilm made a soft, 
shuffling noise as he circled the 
bed. He cracked the door to the 
living room and watted a long 
moment Nothing happened. It 
was so quiet, he could hear the 
thin whistle of Jessie's breath 
from their bed and the dull 
rhythm of his pulse in his ears. 

TTIS hand crept through the 
opening of the door, snaking 
out to the spot he needed no 
light to find. His fingers closed 
upon the knob that controlled 
the ceiling illumination. He exerted the smallest pressure he 
could and the ceiling gleamed 
dimly, so dimly that the lower 
half of the living room remained 
in semi-dusk. 

He saw enough, however. The 
main door was closed and the 
living room lay lifeless and quiet. 

He wrenched the knob back 
into the off position and scuttled 
back to bed. 

It was all he needed. The pieces 
joined. The pattern was complete. 

Jessie pleaded with him, "Lije, 
what's wrong?" 

"Nothing's wrong, Jessie. Everything's all right. He's not 
here." 

"The robot? Do you meanJie's 
gone? For good?" 

"No, no. He'll be back. And 
before he does, answer my question." 

"What question?" 



54 




 



"What arc you afraid of?" 

Jessie said nothing. 

Baley grew more insistent. 
"You said you were scared to 
death." 

"Of him." 

"No, we went through that." 

Her words came slowly. "I 
thought if everyone knew he was 
a robot there might be a riot. 
We'd be killed." 

"Why us?" 

"You know what riots are 
like." 

"They don't even know where 
the robot is, do they?" 

"They might find out." 

"And thaf s what you're afraid 
of, a riot?" 

"Well—" 

"Sh!" He pressed Jessie down 
to the pillow. Then he put his 
lips to her ear. "He's come 
back. Now listen and don't say 
a word. Everything's fine. He'll 
be gone in the morning and he 
won't be back. There'll be no 
riot, nothing." 

He was almost contented as 
he said that. He felt he could 
sleep. 

He thought again: No riot, 
nothing. 

And no declassification. 

And just before he actually fell 
asleep, he thought: Not even a 
murder investigation. Not even 
that. 

The whole thing's solved — 
He slept. 



CHAPTER VII 

"PNDERBY polished his glasses with exquisite care and 
placed them upon the bridge of 
his nose. 

Baley thought: It's a good 
trick. Keeps you busy while 
you're thinking what to say, and 
it doesn't cost money the way 
lighting up a pipe does. 

And because the thought had 
entered his mind, he drew out 
his pipe and dipped into his 
pinched store of rough-cut. One 
of the few luxury crops still 
grown on Earth was tobacco, and 
its end was visibly approaching. 
Prices had gone up, never down, 
in Baley's lifetime: quotas down, 
never up. 

Enderby, having adjusted his 
glasses, felt for the switch at one 
end of his desk and flicked his 
door into one-way transparency 
for a moment. "Where is he now, 
Lije?" 

"He told me he wanted to be 
shown through the department, 
and I let Jack Tobin do the 
honors." Baley lit his pipe and 
tightened its baffle carefully. The 
Commissioner, like most non-indulgers, was petty about tobacco 
smoke. 

"I hope you didn't tell him 
Daneel was a robot." 

"Of course I didn't." 

The Commissioner did not relax. One hand remained aimlessly 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



55 



busy with the automatic calendar on his desk. 

"How is it?" he asked, without 
looking at Baley. 

"Middling rough." 

"I'm sorry, Lije'." 

Baley said firmly, "You might 
have warned me that he looked 
completely human." 

The Commissioner showed surprise. "I didn't?" Then, with sudden petulance, "Damn it, you 
should have known. I wouldn't 
have asked you to have him stay 
at your house if he looked like R. 
Sammy, would I?" 

"I know. Commissioner, but I'd 
never seen a robot like that and 
you had. I didn't even know such 
things were possible. I just wish 
you'd mentioned it, that's all." 

"I'm sorry. I should have told 
you. But this job has me so on 
edge that half the time I'm snapping at people fpr no reason. He — 
I mean this Daneel thing — is a 
new-type robot. It's still in the 
experimental stage." 

"He said so himself." 

"Oh. WeU, that's it." 

Baley tensed a little. He said 
casually, teeth clenched on pipestem, "R. Daneel has arranged a 
trip to Spacetown for me." 

"To Spacetown V Enderby 
looked up with indignation. 

"Yes. It's the logical next move, 
Commissioner. I'd like to see the 
scene of the crime; ask a few 
questions." 



JULIUS Enderby shook his 
head decidedly. "I don't think 
thafs a good idea, Lije. We've 
gone over the ground. I doubt 
there's anything new to be learned. And they're strange people. 
They've got to be handled with 
Plastoftlm gloves. You don't have 
the experience." He added, with 
unexpected fervor, "I hate them!" 

Baley injected hostility into 
his voice. "The robot came here 
and I should go there. It's bad 
enough sharing a front seat with 
a robot; I hate to take a back 
seat. Of course, if you don't think 
I'm capable of running this investigation, Commissioner — " 

"It isn't that, Lije. It's not you, 
it's the Spacers. You don't know 
what they're like." 

"Well, then, suppose you come 
along." 

"No, Lije, I won't go there! 
Don't ask me to!" More quietly, 
he said, with an unconvincing 
smile, "Lots of work here, you 
know. I'm days behind." 

Baley regarded him thoughtfully. "I tell you what. then. 
Why not get into it by trimension later on? Just for a while, 
you understand. In case I need 
help." 

"Well, yes. I suppose I can do 
that." He sounded unenthusiastic. 

"Good." Baley glanced at the 
wall-clock, nodded, and got up. 
"I'll be in touch with you." 

Baley looked back as he left 



56 




 



the office, keeping the door open 
for part of an additional second. 
He saw the Commissioner's head 
begin bending down toward the 
crook of one elbow as it rested 
on the desk. The plainclothesman 
could almost swear he heard a 
sob. 

Jehoshaphat! he thought, in 
outright shock. 

He paused in the common 
room and sat on the corner of a 
nearby desk, ignoring its occupant, who looked up, murmured 
a casual greeting, and returned 
to his work. 

Baley undipped the baffle 
from the bowl of the pipe and 
blew into it. He inverted the 
pipe itself over the desk's small 
ash-vacuum and let the powdery-white tobacco ash vanish. 
He looked regretfully at the 
empty pipe, readjusted the baffle, 
and put it away. Another pipeful 
gone forever. 

He reconsidered what had just 
taken place. In one way, Enderby 
had not surprised him. He had 
expected resistance to any attempt on his own part to enter 
Spacetown. He had heard the 
Commissioner talk often enough 
about the difficulties of dealing 
with Spacers, about the dangers 
of allowing any but experienced 
negotiators to have anything to 
do with them, even over trifles. 

He had not expected, however, 
to have the Commissioner give 



in so easily. He had supposed, at 
the very least,- that Enderby 
would have insisted on accompanying him. The pressure of 
other work was meaningless in 
the face of the importance of this 
problem. 

And that was not what Baley 
wanted. He wanted exactly what 
he got. He wanted the Commissioner to be present by trimensional personification so that he 
could witness the proceedings 
from a place of safety*. 

SAFETY was the keyword. 
Baley would need a witness 
who could not be put out of the 
way immediately. He needed that 
as the minimum guarantee of his 
own safety. 

The Commissioner had agreed 
to it at once. Baley remembered 
the parting sob, or ghost of one, 
and thought: Jehoshaphat, the 
man's into this beyond his depth. 

A cheerful, slurring voice 
sounded just at Baley's shoulder, 
and Baley started. 

"What the devil do you want?" 
he demanded. 

The smile on R. Sammy's face 
remained foolishly fixed. "Jack 
says to tell you Daneel is ready, 
Lije." 

"All right. Now get out of 

here." 

He frowned at the robot's departing back. There was nothing 
so irritating as having that 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



57 



clumsy metal contraption forever 
making free with his front name. 
He'd complained about that when 
R. Sammy first arrived and the 
Commissioner had shrugged his 
shoulders and said, "You can't 
have it both ways, Lije. The 
public insists that City robots be 
built with a strong friendship 
circuit. All right, then. He is 
drawn to you. He calls you by 
the friendliest name he knows." 
Friendship circuit! No robot 



built, of any type, could possibly hurt a human being. That 
was the First Law of Robotics: 
"A robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, 
allow a human being to come to 
harm." 

No positronic brain was ever 
built without that injunction 
driven so deeply into its basic 
circuits that no conceivable derangement could displace it. 
There was no need for special


58 




 



ized friendship circuits. 

Yet the Commissioner was 
right. The Earthman's fear and 
resentment of robots were so deep 
and so justified that friendship 
circuits had to be incorporated, 
just as all robots had to be made 
smiling. On Earth, at any rate. 
- R. Daneel, though, never 
smiled. 

Sighing, Baley rose to his feet. 
He thought: Spacetown, next 
stop. Or, maybe, last stop. 

rjiHE police forces of the City, 
-■■ as well as certain high officials, could still make use of individual squad-cars along the 
corridors of the City and even 
along the ancient underground 
motorways that were barred to 
foot-traffic. There were perennial 
demands by the Medievalists that 
these motorways be converted to 
children's playgrounds, to new 
shopping areas or to Expressway 
or Localway extensions. 

The strong pleas of "Civic 
Safety" remained unvanquished, 
however. In cases of fires too large 
to be handled by local devices; 
in cases of massive breakdowns 
in power lines or ventilators; 
most of all in cases of serious 
riot, there had to be some means 
whereby the forces of the City 
could be mobilized at the stricken 
point in a hurry. No substitute 
for the motorways existed or 
could exist. 



Baley had traveled along a 
motorway several times before 
in his life, but its indecent emptiness always depressed him. It 
seemed a million miles from the 
warm , living pulsation of the 
City. It stretched out like a 
blind and hollow worm before his 
eyes as he sat at the controls of 
the squad-car. It opened continuously into new stretches as he 
moved around this gentle curve 
or that. Behind him, he knew 
without looking, another blind 
and hollow worm continually 
contracted and closed. The motorway was well -lit, but lighting 
was meaningless in the silence 
and emptiness. 

R. Daneel did nothing to break 
that silence or fill that emptiness. He looked straight ahead, 
as unimpressed by the empty 
motorway as by the bulging Expressway. 

In one sounding moment, to 
the tune of a wild whine of the 
squad-car's siren, they popped 
out of the motorway and curved 
gradually into the vehicular lane 
of a City corridor. 

The vehicular lanes were still 
conscientiously marked down 
each major corridor in reverence 
for one vestigial portion of the 
past. There were no vehicles any 
longer except for squad-cars, and 
pedestrians used the lanes in complete self-assurance. They scattered in indignant hurry before 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



59 



the rush of Baley's squealing car. 

Baley himself drew a freer 
breath as noise surged in about 
him, but it was an interval only. 
They turned into the subdued 
corridors that led to Spacetown 
Entrance. 

"VTATURALLY, they were ex' pected. The guards obviously knew R. Daneel by sight and, 
although themselves human, 
nodded to him without the least 
self -consciousness or condescension. 

One approached Baley and 
saluted with perfect, if frigid, 
military courtesy. He was tall 
and grave, though not the perfect specimen of Spacer physique 
that R. Daneel was. 

He said, "Your identification 
card, if you please, sir." 

It was inspected quickly but 
thoroughly. Baley noticed that 
the guard wore flesh -colored 
gloves and had an all-but-unnoticeable filter in each nostril. 

The guard saluted again and 
returned the card. He said, 
"There is a Men's Personal here 
which we would be pleased to 
have you use to shower." 

.Baley was about to deny the 
necessity, but as the guard stepped back to his place, R. Daneel 
said, "It is customary, Partner 
Elijah, for City-dwellers to shower before entering Spacetown. I 
tell you this since I know you 



have no desire, through lack of 
information on this matter, to 
render yourself or ourselves uncomfortable. It is also advisable 
for you to attend to any matters 
of personal hygiene you may 
think advisable. There will be no 
facilities within Spacetown for 
that purpose." 

"No facilities? That's impossible? 

• "I mean, of course," said R. 
Daneel, "none for use by Citydwellers." 

Baley's face filled with a clearly hostile astonishment. 

R, Daneel said, "I regret the 
situation, but it is a matter of 
custom." 

Wordlessly, Baley entered the 
Personal. He felt, rather than 
saw, R. Daneel entering behind 
him. 

He thought: Checking on me? 
Making sure I wash the alleged 
City filth off myself? 

For a furious moment, he reveled in the thought of the shock 
he was preparing fpr Spacetown. 
It seemed to him suddenly unimportant that he might, in effect, 
be pointing a blaster at his own 
chest. 

The Personal was small, but it 
was well appointed and antiseptjc 
in its cleanliness. There was a 
trace of sharpness in the air. 
Baley sniffed at it, momentarily 
puzzled. 

Then he thought: Ozone! 



60 




 



They've got ultra-violet radiation 
flooding the place, 

A little sign blinked on and 
off several times, then remained 
steadily lit. It said, "Visitor Will 
Please Remove All Clothing, Including Shoes, and Place It in the 
Receptacle Below." 

Baley obeyed. He unhitched his 
blaster and blaster-strap and recircled it about his naked waist. 
It felt heavy and uncomfortable. 

The receptacle closed and his 
clothing was gone. The lighted 
sign blanked out. A new sign 
flashed ahead. 

It said: "Visitor Will Please 
Tend to Personal Needs, then 
Make Use of the Shower Indicated by Arrow." 

Baley felt like a machine-tool 
being shaped by long-distance 
force-edges on an assembly line. 

TTIS first act upon entering the 
small shower cubicle was to 
draw up the moistureproof flap 
on his blaster holster and slip it 
down firmly. He knew by repeated test that he could still 
draw and fire it in less than five 
seconds. 

There was no knob or hook 
on which to hang his blaster. 
There was not even a visible 
shower head. He placed the 
weapon in a corner away from 
the cubicle's entrance door. 

Another sign flashed: "Visitor 
Will Please Hold Arms Directly 



Out from His Body and Stand in 
the Central Circle with Feet in 
the Indicated Positions." 

As he placed his feet in the 
small depressions allowed for 
them, the sign blanked out. A 
stinging, foaming spray hit him 
from ceiling, floor and four walls. 
He felt the water welling up even 
beneath the soles of his feet. For 
a full minute it lasted, his skin 
reddening under the combined 
force of the heat and pressure 
and his lungs gasping for air in 
the warm dampness. There followed another minute of cool, 
low-pressure spray, and then 
finally a current of warm air that 
left him dry and refreshed. 

He picked up his blaster and 
blaster-strap and found that they, 
too. were dry and warm. He put 
them on and stepped out of the 
cubicle in time to see R. Daneel 
emerge from a neighboring 
shower. Of course! R. Daneel was 
not a City-dweller, but he had 
accumulated City dust. 

Quite automatically, Baley 
looked away. Then with the 
thought that, after all, R. 
Daneel's customs were not City 
customs, he forced his unwilling 
eyes back for one moment. His 
lips quirked in a tiny smile. R. 
Daneel's resemblance to humanity was not restricted to his face 
and hands, but had been carried 
out with painstaking accuracy 
over the entire body. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



61 



Baley stepped forward in the 
direction he had been traveling 
continuously since entering the 
Personal. He found his clothes 
waiting for him, neatly folded. 
They had a warm, clean odor. 

A sign said, "Visitor Will 
Please Resume His Clothing and 
Place His Hand in the Indicated 
Depression." 

Baley did so. He felt a definite 
tingling in the ball of his middle 
finger as he laid it down upon the 
clean, milky surface. He lifted his 
hand hastily and found a little 
drop of blood oozing out. As he 
watched it, it stopped flowing. 

He shook it off and pinched the 
finger. No more blood was flowing even then. 

Obviously, they were analyzing 
his blood. He felt a surge of 
anxiety. His own yearly routine 
examination by Department doctors, he felt sure, was not carried 
on with the thoroughness or, perhaps, with the knowledge of these 
cold, robot-makers from outer 
space. He was not sure he wanted 
too probing an inquiry into the 
state of his health. 

The time of waiting seemed 
long to Baley, but when the light 
flashed again, it said simply, 
"Visitor Will Proceed." 

Baley drew a long breath of 
relief. He walked onward and 
stepped through an archway. 
Two metal rods closed in before 
him and, written in luminous air. 



were the words: "Visitor is 
Warned to Proceed no Farther." 

"What the devil — " called out 
Baley, forgetting in his anger the 
fact that he was still in the Personal. 

RDANEEL'S voice was in 
• his ear. "The sniffers have 
detected a power source, I imagine. Are you carrying your blaster, Elijah?" 

Baley whirled, his face a deep 
crimson. He tried twice, then 
managed to croak out, "A police 
officer has his blaster on him or 
in easy reach at all times." 

It was the first time he had 
spoken in a Personal, proper, 
since he was ten years old. That 
had been in his Uncle Boris's 
presence and had merely been 
an automatic complaint when he 
stubbed his toe. Uncle Boris had 
slapped him hard when he reached home and had lectured him 
strongly on public decency. 

R. Daneel said, "No visitor 
may be armed. It is our custom, 
Elijah. Even your Commissioner 
leaves his blaster behind on all 
visits." 

Under almost any other circumstances, Baley would have 
walked away, away from Spacetown and away from that robot. 
Now, however, he'd been given 
additional goads to go through 
with his plan and have his revenge. 




 



In black anger, Baley unhitched his blaster belt. R. Daneel took 
it from him and placed it within 
a recess in the wall. A thin metal 
plate slithered across it. 

"If you will put your thumb in 
the depression," said R. Daneel, 
"only your thumb will open it 
later on." 

Baley felt undressed, far more 
so, in fact, than he had felt in 
the shower. He stepped across the 
point at which the rods had 
barred him, and, finally, out the 
Personal. 

He was back in a corridor 
again, but there was an element 
of strangeness about it. Up ahead, 
the light had an unfamiliar quality to it. He felt a whiff of air 
against his face. Automatically, 
he thought a squad-car had 
passed. 

R. Daneel must have read his 
uneasiness in his face. He said, 
"You are in open air now, Elijah. 
It is unconditioned." 

Baley felt faintly sick. How 
could the Spacers be so rigidly 
careful of a human body, merely 
because it came from the City, 
and then breathe the dirty air of 
the open fields? He tightened his 
nostrils, as though by pulling 
them together he could more 
effectively screen the ingoing air. 

R, Daneel said, "I believe you 
will find the open air is not 
deleterious to human health." 

"All right," said Baley faintly. 



The air currents hit queasily 
against his face. They were gentle 
enough, but they were erratic. 
That bothered him. 

Worse came. The corridor 
opened into blueness and as they 
approached its end, strong white 
light washed down. Baley had 
seen sunlight. He had been in a 
natural Solarium once in the line 
of duty. But protecting glass had 
enclosed the place and the Sun's 
own image had been refracted 
into a generalized glow. Here, all 
was open. 

A Spacer was approaching. A 
tiny moment of terror struck 
Baley. 

R. Daneel, however, stepped 
forward to greet the approaching 
man with a handshake. The 
Spacer turned to Baley and said, 
"Won't you come with me, sir? 
I am Dr. Han Fastolfe." 

TT was better inside one of the 
domes. Baley found himself 
goggling at the si2e of the rooms 
and the way in which space was 
so carelessly distributed, but was 
thankful for the feel of the conditioned air. 

Fastolfe said, sitting down and 
crossing his long legs, "I'm assuming that you prefer air-conditioning to unobstructed wind." 

He seemed friendly enough. 
There were fine wrinkles on his 
forehead and a certain flabbiness 
to the skin below his eyes and 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



63 



just under his chin. His hair was 
thinning, but showed no signs of 
gray. His large ears stood away 
from his head, giving him a humorous and homely appearance 
that comforted Baley. 

Early that morning, Baley had 
looked once again at those pictures of Spacetown that Enderby 
had taken. R. Daneel had just 
arranged the Spacetown appointment and Baley was absorbing 
the notion that he was to meet 
Spacers in the flesh. Somehow 
that was considerably different 
from speaking to them across 
miles of carrier wave, as he had 
done on several occasions before. 

The Spacers in those pictures 
had been, generally speaking, like 
those that were occasionally featured in the book-films: tall, 
grave, coldly handsome. Like R. 
Daneel Olivaw, for instance. 

R. Daneel had named the 
Spacers for Baley and when 
Baley suddenly pointed and said, 
in surprise, "That isn't you, is it?" 
R. Daneel unemotionally answered, **No, Elijah, that was my 
designer, Dr. Sarton, the one who 
was murdered." 

"You were made in your maker's image?" asked Baley sardonically, but there was no answer 
to that and Baley scarcely expected one. A robot wouldn't 
know anything about the Bible. 

And now Baley looked at Han 
Fastolfe, a man who deviated 

64 < 



noticeably from the Spacer norm 
in looks, and the Earthman felt 
gratitude for that fact 

"Won't you accept food?" 
asked Fastolfe. 

He indicated the table that 
separated himself and R. Daneel 
from the Earthman. It bore nothing but a bowl of van-colored 
spheroids- Baley felt vaguely 
startled. He had taken them for 
table decorations. 

R. Daneel explained, "These 
are the fruits of natural plantlife grown on Aurora. I suggest 
you try this kind. It is called an 
apple and is reputed to be tasty." 

Fastolfe smiled. "R. Daneel 
does not know this by personal 
experience, of course, but he is 
quite right." 

TJALEY brought an apple to 
" his mouth. Its surface was red 
and green. It was cool to the 
touch and had a faint but pleasant odor. With an effort, he bit 
into it and the unexpected tartness hurt his teeth. 

He chewed it gingerly. City' dwellers ate natural food, of 
course, whenever rations allowed 
it. He himself had eaten real 
meat and bread several times. 
But such food had always been 
processed in some way. It had 
been cooked or ground, blended 
or compounded. Fruit, now, propt erly speaking, should come in the 
1 form of sauce or preserve. What 


 



he was holding must have come 
straight from the dirt of a planet's 
soil. 

He thought: I hope they've 
washed it, at least. And again he 
wondered at the spottiness of 
Spacer notions about cleanliness. 

Fastolfe said, "Let me introduce myself a bit more specifically. I am in charge of the 
investigation of the murder of Dr. 
Sarton at the Spacetown end as 
Commissioner Enderby is at the 
City end. If I can help you in 
any way, I stand ready to do so. 
We are as eager for a quiet solution of the affair and prevention 
of future incidents of this sort as 
any of you City men can be." 

"Thank you, Dr. Fastolfe," 
said Baley. "Your attitude is appreciated." 

So much, he thought, for the 
amenities. He bit into the center 
of the apple and hard, dark little 
ovoids popped into his mouth. 
He spat automatically. They flew 
out and fell to the ground. One 
would have struck Fastolfe's leg 
had not the Spacer moved it 
hastily. 

Baley reddened, started to 
bend. 

Fastolfe said, pleasantly, "It is 
quite all right, Mr. Baley. Just 
leave them, please." 

Baley straightened again. He 
put the apple down gingerly. He 
had the uncomfortable feeling 
that once he was gone, the lost 



little objects would be found and 
picked up by suction; the bowl 
of fruit would be burned or discarded far from Spacetown; the 
very room they were sitting in 
would be sprayed with viricide. 

He covered his embarrassment 
with brusqueness. He said, "I 
would like to ask permission to 
have Commissioner Enderby join 
our conference by trimensional 
personification." 

Fastolfe's eyebrows raised. 
"Certainly, if you wish it. Daneel, 
would you make the connection?" 

TN stiff discomfort, Baley waited 
■*■ until the shiny surface of the 
large parallelopiped in one corner 
of the room dissolved away to 
show Commissioner Julius Enderby and part of his desk. At 
that moment, the discomfort 
eased and Baley felt nothing 
short of love for that familiar 
figure, and a nostalgic longing 
to be safely back in that office 
with him, or anywhere in the 
City, for that matter — even in 
the least prepossessing portion 
of the Jersey yeast vat districts. 

Now that he had his witness, 
Baley saw no reason for delay. 
He said, "I believe I have penetrated the mystery surrounding 
the death of Dr. Sarton." 

Out of the corner of his eyes, 
he saw Enderby springing to his 
feet and grabbing wildly (and 
successfully) at his flying spec


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



65 



tacles. By standing, the Commissioner thrust his head out of the 
limits of the trimensic receiver 
and was forced to sit down again, 
red-faced and speechless. 

In a much quieter way, Dr. 
Fastolfe, head inclined to one 
side, was as startled. Only R. 
Daneel remained unmoved. 

"Do you mean," said Fastolfe, 
"that you know who the murderer is?" 

"No," Baley replied. "I mean 
there was no murder." 

"What?" yelped Enderby. 

"One moment, Commissioner 



Enderby," said Fastolfe, raising 
a hand. His eyes held Baley's and 
he asked in a tensely quiet voice, 
"Do you mean that Dr. Sarton 
is alive?" 

"That's exactly what I mean. 
And I believe I know where he 
is." 

Enderby's slack mouth silently 
formed the word, but it was 
Fastolfe who said it: 

"Where?" 

"Right there," said Baley. 
He pointed straight at R. 
Daneel Olivaw.

In next month's installment of THE CAVES OF STEEL, Isaac Asimov 
continues building the tension and threat of his mystery plot . . . while

you'll have lived through a dangerous hunt in a society so realistically described that you could almost find your way around in it without a guidel 
Few things are more difficult than science fiction's integration of plot and 
unfamiliar background— when ifs done well. Asimov has done it magnificently. The devil of his murder problem is that it must be solved in 
exactly the right way or disaster will come to the detective or Earth! 

KEEP YOUR SHAPE by Robert Sheckley unfortunately was squeezed 
out of this issue. It'll definitely be in the next. The title, as previously noted, 
is more than on advertising slogan; ifs a military command to the most 
fiercely rigid warriors ever seen on this planetl 

The second novelet, THE BOOK by Michoel Shaara, is a curiously tender 
story of a civilization that never has a moment's security! Ifs the reverse of

the MODEL 
of a JUDGE 



Should a former outlaw become 
a judge — even if he need only 
pass sentence on a foyer cake? 

By WILLIAM MORRISON 



RONAR was reformed, if 
that was the right word, 
but he could see that 
they didn't trust him. Uneasiness 
spoke in their awkward hurried 
motions when they came near 
him; fear looked out of their 



eyes. He had to reassure himself 
that all this would pass. In time 
they'd learn to regard him as one 
of themselves and cease to recall 
what he had once been. For the 
time being, however, they still 
remembered. And so did he.

THE MODEL OF A JUDGE 



67 



Mrs. Claymore, of the Presiding Committee, was babbling, 
"Oh, Mrs. Silver, it's so good of 
you to come. Have you entered 
the contest?" 

"Not really," said Mrs. Silver 
with a modest laugh. "Of course 
I don't expect to win against so 
many fine women who are taking 
part. But I just thought I'd enter 
to — to keep things interesting." 

"That was very kind of you. 
But don't talk about not winning. 
I still remember some of the 
dishes you served for dinner at 
your home that time George and 
I paid you a visit. Mmmmm — 
they were really delicious." 

Mrs. Silver uttered another little laugh. "Just ordinary recipes. 
I'm so glad you liked them, 
though." 

"I certainly did. And I'm sure 
the judge will like your cake, 
too." 

"The judge? Don't you usually 
have a committee?" 

HE could hear every word. 
They had no idea how sharp 
his sense of hearing was, and he 
had no desire to disconcert them 
further by letting them know. He 
"could hear every conversation 
taking place in ordinary tones in 
the large reception room. When 
he concentrated he could make 
out the whispers. At this point he 
had to concentrate, for Mrs. Claymore leaned over and breathed 



into her friend's attentive ear. 

"My dear, haven't you heard? 
We've had such trouble with that 
committee — there were such 
charges of favoritism! It was really awful." 

"Really? But how did you find 
a judge then?" 

"Don't look now — no, I'll tell 
you what to do. Pretend I said 
something funny, and throw your 
head back and laugh. Take a 
quick glance at him while you 
do. He's sitting up there alone, 
on the platform." 

Mrs. Silver laughed gracefully 
as directed, and her eyes swept 
the platform. She became so excited, she almost forgot to whisper. 

"Why, he's — " 

"Shhh. Lower your voice, my 
dear." 

"Why — he isn't human!" 

"He's supposed to be — now. 
But, of course, that's a matter 
of opinion!" 

"But who on Earth thought of 
making him judge?" 

"No one on Earth. Professor 
Haider, who lives over on that big 
asteroid the other side of yours, 
heard of the troubles we had, and 
came up with the suggestion. At 
first it seemed absurd — " 

"It certainly seems absurd to 
me!" agreed Mrs. Silver. 

"It was the only thing we could 
do. There was no one else we 
could trust." 



68 




 



"But what does he know about 
cakes?'* 

"My dear, he has the most exquisite sense of taste!" 

"I still don't understand." 

"It's superhuman. Before we 
adopted Professor Haider's suggestion, we gave him a few tests. 
The results simply left us gasping. We could mix all sorts of 
spices — the most delicate, most 
exotic herbs from Venus or Mars, 
and the strongest, coarsest flavors 
from Earth or one of the plantgrowing asteroids — and he could 
tell us everything we had added, 
and exactly how much." 

I FIND that hard to believe, 
Matilda." 
"Isn't it? It's honestly incredible. If I hadn't seen him do it 
myself, 1 wouldn't have believed 
it." 

"But he doesn't have human 
preferences. Wasn't he — wasn't 
he — " 

".Carnivorous? Oh, yes They 
say he was the most vicious creature imaginable. Let an animal 
come within a mile of him, and 
he'd scent it and be after it in a 
flash. He and the others of his 
kind made the moon he came 
from uninhabitable for any other 
kind of intelligent life. Come to 
think of it, it may have been the 
very moon we're on now!" 

"Really?" 

"Either this, or some other 



moon of Saturn's. We had to do 
something about it. We didn't 
want to kill them off, naturally; 
that would have been the easiest 
way, but so uncivilized! Finally, 
our scientists came up with the 
suggestion for psychological reforming. Professor Haider told 
us how difficult it all was, but it 
seems to have worked. In his case, 
at least."i 

Mrs. Silver stole another 
glance. "Did it? I don't notice 
any one going near him." 

"Oh, we don't like to tempt 
fate, Clara. But, if there were 
really any danger, I'm sure the 
psychologists would never have 
let him out of their clutches." 

"I hope not. But psychologists 
take the most reckless risks sometimes — with other people's lives!" 

"Well, there's one psychologist 
who's risking his own life — and 
his own wife, too. You know Dr. 
Cabanis, don't you?" 

"Only by sight. Isn't his wife 
that stuck-up thing?" 

"That's the one. Dr. Cabanis 
is the man who had actual charge 
of reforming him. And he's going 
to be here. His wife is entering 
a cake." 

"Don't tell me that she really 
expects to win!" 

"She bakes well, my dear. Let's 
give the she-devil her due. How 
on Earth an intelligent man like 
Dr. Cabanis can stand her, I don't 
know, but, after all, he's the psy


THE MODEL OF A JUDGE 



69 



chologist, not I, and he could 
probably explain it better than 
I could." 

RONAR disengaged his attention. 

So Dr. Cabanis was here. He 
looked around, but the psychologist was not in sight. He would 
probably arfive later. 

The thought stirred a strange 
mixture of emotions. Some of the 
most painful moments of his life 
were associated with the presence 
of Dr. Cabaflis. His early life, the 
life of a predatory carnivore, had 
been an unthinkingly happy one. 
He supposed that he could call 
his present life a happy one too, 
if you weren't overly particular 
how you dffined the term. But 
that period in between! 

That had been, to say the least, 
painful. Those long sessions with 
Dr. Cabanis had stirred him to 
the depths of a soul he hadn't 
known he possessed. The electric 
shocks and the druggings he 
hadn't minded so much. But the 
gradual reshaping of his entire 
psyche, the period of basic instruction, in which he had been 
taught to hate his old life so 
greatly that he could no longer 
go back to it even if the way were 
open, and the conditioning for a 
new and useful life with human 
beings — that was torture of the 
purest kind. 

If he had known what was 



ahead of him, he wouldn't have 
gone through it at all. He'd have 
fought until he dropped, as so 
many of the others like him did. 
Still, now that it was over, he 
supposed that the results were 
worth the pain. He had a position 
that was more important than it 
seemed at first glance. He exercised control over a good part of 
the food supply intended for the 
outer planets, and his word was 
trusted implicitly. Let him condemn an intended shipment, and 
cancellation followed automatically, without the formality of 
confirmation by laboratory tests. 
He was greatly admired. And 
feared. 

They had other feelings about 
him too. He overheard one whisper that surprised him. "My dear, 
I think he's really handsome." 

"But, Charlotte, how can you 
say that about someone who isn't 
even human!" 

"He looks more human than 
many human beings do. And his 
clothes fit him beautifully. I wonder — does he have a tail?" 

"Not that I know of." 

"Oh." There was disappointment in the sound. "He looks like 
a pirate." 

"He was a kind of wolf, they 
tell me. You'd never guess, to see 
him, that he ran on all fours, 
would you?" 

"Of course not. He's so straight 
and dignified."

THE MODEL OF A JUDGE

"It just shows you what psychology can do." 

PSYCHOLOGY, and a series 
df operations, dear ladies," he 
thought sarcastically. ."Without 
them I wouldn't be able to stand 
so nice and straight with the help 
of all the psychologists in this 
pretty little solar system of ours." 

From behind a potted Martian 
nut-cactus came two low voices 
— not whispers this time. And 
there was several octaves difference in pitch between them. One 
male, one female. 

The man said, "Don't be worried, sweetheart. I'll match your 
cooking and baking against anybody's." 

There was a curious sound, between a click and a hiss. What 
human beings called a kiss, he 
thought. Between the sexes, usually an indication of affection or 
passion. Sometimes, especially 
within the ranks of the female 
sex, a formality behind which 
warfare could be waged. 

The girl said tremulously, "But 
these women have so much experience. They've cooked and 
baked for years." 

"Haven't you, for your own 
family?" 

"Yes, but that isn't the same 
thing. I had to learn from a cookbook. And I had no one with experience to stand over me and 
teach me." 



"You've learned faster that 
way than you'd have done with 
some of these old hens standing 
at your elbow and giving you 
directions. You cook roo well. I'll 
be fat in no time." 

"Your mother doesn't think so. 
And your brother said something 
about a bride's biscuits — " 

"The older the joke, the better 
Charles likes it. Don't let it worry 
you." He kissed her again. "Have 
confidence in yourself, dear. 
You're going to win." 

"Oh, Gregory, it's awfully nice 
of you to say so, but really I feel 
so unsure of myself." 

"If only the judge were human 
and took a look at you, nobody 
else would stand a chance. Have 
I told you within the last five 
minutes that you're beautiful?" 

T>ONAR disengaged his attention again. He found human 
love-making as repulsive as most 
human food. 

He picked up a few more whispers. And then Dr. Cabanis came 
in. 

The good doctor looked around, 
smiled, greeted several ladies of 
his acquaintance as if he were 
witnessing a private strip-tease of 
their souls, and then came direct-, 
ly up to the platform. "How are 
you, Ronar?" 

"Fine, Doctor. Are you here to 
keep an eye on me?" 

"I hardly think that's neces


72 




 



sary. I have an interest in the 
results of the judging. My wife 
has baked a cake." 

"I had no idea that cake-baking was so popular a human avocation." 

"Anything that requires skill is 
sure to become popular among us. 
By the way, Ronar, I hope you 
don't feel hurt." 

"Hurt, Doctor? What do you 
mean?" 

1 "Come now, you understand 
me well enough. These people still 
don't trust you. I can tell by the 
way they keep their distance." 

"I take human frailty into account, Doctor. Frailty, and lack 
of opportunity. These men and 
women haven't had the opportunity for extensive psychological 
treatment that I've had. I don't 
expect too much of them." 

"You've scored a point there, 
Ronar." 

"Isn't there something that can 
be done for them, Doctor? Some 
treatment that it would be legal 
to give them?" 

"It would have to be voluntary. 
You see, Ronar, you were considered only an animal, and treatment was necessary to save your 
life. But these people are supposed to have rights. One of their 
rights is to be left alone with 
their infirmities. Besides, none of 
them are seriously ill. They hurt 
no one." 

For a second Ronar had a hu


man temptation. It was on the 
tip of his tongue to say, "Your 
wife too, Doctor? People wonder 
how you stand her." But he resisted it. He had resisted more 
serious temptations. 

A GONG sounded gently but 
pervasively. Dr. Cabanis 
said, "I hope you have no resentment against me at this stage of 
the game, Ronar. I'd hate to have 
my wife lose the prize because the 
judge was prejudiced." 

"Have no fear, Doctor. I take 
professional pride in my work. I 
will choose only the best." 

"Of course, the fact that the 
cakes are numbered and not 
signed with the names of their 
creators will make things simpler." 

"That would matter with human judges. It does not affect 
me." 

Another gong sounded, more 
loudly this time. Gradually the 
conversation stopped. A man in 
a full dress suit, with yellow 
stripes down the sides of his 
shorts, and tails hanging both 
front and rear, climbed up on 
the platform. His eyes shone 
with a greeting so warm that the 
fear was almost completely hidden. "How are you, Ronar? Glad 
to see you." 

"I'm fine, Senator. And you?" 

"Couldn't be better. Have a 
cigar." 



THE MODEL OF A JUDGE 



"No, thank you. I don't 
smoke." 

"That's right, you don't. Besides, I'd be wasting the cigar. 
You don't vote!" He laughed 
heartily. 

"I understand that they're 
passing a special law to let — people — like me vote at the next 
election." 

"I'm for it, Ronar, I'm for it. 
You can count on me." 

The chairman came up on the 
platform, a stout and dignified 
woman who smiled at both Ronar 
and the Senator, and shook hands 
with both without showing signs 
of distaste for either. The assembled competitors and spectators 
took seats. 

The chairman cleared her 
throat. "Ladies and gentlemen, let 
us open this meeting by singing 
the Hymn of All Planets" 

HPHEY all rose, Ronar with 
them. His voice wasn't too 
well adapted to singing, but 
neither, it seemed, were most of 
the human voices. And, at least, 
he knew all the words. 

The chairman proceeded to 
greet the gathering formally, in 
the name of the Presiding Committee. 

Then she introduced Senator 
Whitten. She referred archly to 
the fact that the Senator had long 
since reached the age of indiscretion and had so far escaped mar


riage. He was an enemy of the 
female sex, but they'd let him 
speak to them anyway. 

Senator Whitten just as archly 
took up the challenge. He had" 
escaped more by good luck — if 
you could call it good — than by 
good management. But he was 
sure that if he had ever had the 
fortune to encounter some of the 
beautiful ladies here this fine day, 
and to taste the products of their 
splendid cooking and baking, he 
would have been a lost man. He 
would long since have committed 
polygamy. 

Senator Whitten then launched 
into a paean of praise for the 
ancient art of preparing food. 

Ronar's attention wandered. So 
did that of a good part of the 
audience. His ears picked up another conversation, this time 
whispered between a man and a 
woman in the front row. 

The man said, "I should have 
put your name on it, instead of 
mine." 

"That would have been silly. 
All my friends know that I can't 
bake. And it would look so 
strange if I won." 

"Ifll look stranger if I win. I 
can imagine what the boys in the 
shop will say." 

"Oh, the boys in the shop are 
stupid. What's so unmanly in being able to cook and bake?" 

"I'm not anxious for the news 
to get around."

"Some of the best chefs have 
been men." 

"I'm not a chef." 

"Stop worrying." There was 
exasperation in the force of her 
whisper, "You won't win anyway." 

"I don't know. Sheila — " 
"What?" 

"If I win, will you explain to 
everybody how manly 1 really 
am? Will you be my character 
witness?" 

She repressed a giggle. 

"If you won't help me, I'll 
have to go around giving proof 
myself." 

"Shh, someone will hear you." 

Senator Whitten went on and 
on. 

TJONAR thought back to the 
time when he had wandered 
over the surface of this, his native 
satellite. He no longer had the 
old desires, the old appetites. Only 
the faintest of ghosts still persisted, ghosts with no power to 
do harm. But he could remember 
the old feeling of pleasure, the 
delight of sinking his teeth into 
an animal he had brought down 
himself, the savage joy of gulping 
the tasty flesh. He didn't eat raw 
meat any more ; he didn't eat 
meat at all. He had been conditioned against it. He was now 
half vegetarian, half synthetarian. 
His meals were nourishing, 
healthful, and a part of his life 



he would rather not think about. 

He took no real pleasure in 
the tasting of the cakes and other 
delicacies that born human beings favored. His sense of taste 
had remained keen only to the 
advantage of others. To himself 
it was a tantalizing mockery. 

Senator Whitten's voice came 
to a sudden stop. There was applause. The Senator sat down; 
the chairman stood up. The time 
for the judging had arrived. 

They set out the cakes — more 
than a hundred of them, topped 
by icings of all colors and all 
flavors. The chairman introduced 
Ronar and lauded both his impartiality and the keenness of his 
sense of taste. 

They had a judging card ready. 
Slowly, Ronar began to go down 
the line. 

They might just as well have 
signed each cake with its maker's 
name. As he lifted a portion of 
each to his mouth, he could hear 
the quick intake of breath from 
the woman who had baked it, 
could catch the whispered warning from her companion. There 
were few secrets they could keep 
from him. 

At first they all watched intently. When he had reached the 
fifth cake, however, a hand went 
up in the audience. "Madam 
Chairman!" 

"Please, ladies, let us not interrupt the judging." 



THE MODEL OF A JUDGE 



75 



"But I don't think the judging 
is right. Mr. Ronar tastes hardly 
more than a crumb of each!" 

"A minimum of three crumbs," 
Ronar corrected her. "One from 
the body of the cake, one from 
the icing, and an additional crumb 
from each filling between layers." 

"But you can't judge a cake 
that way! You have to eat it, 
take a whole mouthful — " 

"Please, madam, permit me to 
explain, A crumb is all I need. I 
can analyze the contents of the 
cake sufficiently well from that. 
Let me take for instance Cake 
Number 4, made from an excellent recipe, well baked. Martian 
granis flour, goover eggs, tinganflavored salt, a trace of Venusian 
orange spice, synthetic shortening 
of the best quality. The icing is 
excellent, made with rare dipentose sugars which give it a delightful flavor. Unfortunately, 
however, the cake will not win 
first prize." 

An anguished cry rose from the 
audience. "Why?" 

"Through no fault of your own, 
dear lady. The purberries used in 
making the filling were not freshly 
picked. They have the characteristic flavor of refrigeration." 

"The manager of the store 
swore to me that they were fresh ! 
Oh, HI kill him, I'll murder 
him — " 

She broke down in a flood of 
tears. 



RONAR said to the lady who 
had protested, "I trust, 
madam, that you will now have 
slightly greater confidence in my 
judgment." 
She blushed and subsided. 
Ronar went on with the testing. 
Ninety per cent of the cakes he 
was able to discard at once, from 
some fault in the raw materials 
used or in the method of baking. 
Eleven cakes survived the first 
elimination contest. 

He went over them again, more 
slowly this time. When he had 
completed the second round of 
tests, only three were left. Number 17 belonged to Mrs. Cabanis. 
Number 43 had been made by the 
man who argued with his wife. 
Number 64 was the product of 
the young bride, whom he had 
still not seen. 

Ronar paused. "My sense of 
taste is somewhat fatigued. I 
shall have to ask for a short 
recess before proceeding further." 

There was a sigh from the audience. The tension was not released, it was merely relaxed for 
a short interval. 

Ronar said to the chairman, "t 
should like a few moments of 
fresh air. That will restore me. 
Do you mind?" * 
"Of course not, Mr. Ronar." 
He went outside. Seen through 
the thin layer of air which surrounded the group of buildings, 
and the plastic bubble which kept 



76 




 



the air from escaping into space, 
the stars were brilliant and peaceful. The Sun, far away, was like 
a father star who was too kind 
to obliterate his children. Strange, 
he thought, to recall that this was 
his native satellite. A few years 
ago it had been a different world. 
As for himself, he could live just 
as well outside the bubble as in 
it, as well in rarefied air as in 
dense. Suppose he were to tear 
a hole in the plasticForbidden thoughts. He checked himself, and concentrated on 
the three cakes and the three contestants. 

"You aren't supposed to let 
personal feelings interfere. You 
aren't even supposed to know 
who baked those cakes. But you 
know, all right. And you can't 
keep personal feelings from influencing your judgment. 

"Any one of the cakes is good 
enough to win. Choose whichever 
you please, and no one will have 
a right to criticize. To which are 
you going to award the prize? 

"Number 17? Mrs. Cabanis is, 
as one of the other women has 
so aptly termed her, a bitch on 
wheels. If she wins, she'll be insufferable. And she'll probably 
make her husband suffer. Net that 
he doesn't deserve it. Still, he 
thought he was doing me a favor. 
Will I be doing him a favor if 
I have his wife win? 

"Number 64, now, is insuffer


able in her own right. That loving 
conversation with her husband 
would probably disgust even human ears. On the other hand, 
there is this to be said for her 
winning, it will make the other 
women furious. To think that a 
young snip, just married, without 
real experience in home-making, 
should walk away with a prize of 
this kind! 

"Ah, but if the idea is to burn 
them up, why not give the prize 
to Number 43? They'd be ready 
to drop dead with chalgrin. To 
think that a mere man should 
beat them at their own specialty! 
They'd never be able to hold their 
heads up again. The man 
wouldn't feel too happy about it, 
either. Yes, if it's a matter of 
getting back at these humans for 
the things they've done to me, 
if it's a question of showing them 
what I really think of them, 
Number 43 should get it. 

"On the other hand, I'm supposed to be a model of fairness. 
That's why I got the job in the 
first place. Remember, Ronar? 
Come on, let's go in and try 
tasting them again. Eat a mouthful of each cake, much as you 
hate the stuff. Choose the best 
on its merits." 

rriHEY were babbling when he 
walked in, but the babbling 
stopped quickly. The chairman 
said, "Are we ready, Mr. Ronar?" 



THE MODEL OF A JUDGE 



77 



"All ready." 

The three cakes were placed 
before him. Slowly he took a 
mouthful of Number 17. Slowly 
he chewed it and swallowed it. 
Number 43 followed, then Number 64. 

After the third mouthful, he 
stood lost in thought. One was 
practically as good as another. 
He could still choose which he 
pleased. 

The assemblage had quieted 
down. Only the people most concerned whispered nervously. 

Mrs. Cabanis, to her psychologist husband: "If I don't win, it'll 
be your fault. Ill pay you back 
for this." 

The good doctor's fault? Yes, 
you could figure it that way if 
you wanted to. If not for Dr. 
Cabanis, Ronar wouldn't be the 
judge. If Ronar weren't the judge, 
Mrs. C. would win, she thought. 
Hence it was all her husband's 
fault. Q.E.D. 

The male baker to his wife: "If 
he gives the prize to me, I'll brain 
him. I should never have entered 
this." 

"It's too late to worry now." 



*'I could yell 'Fire'," he whispered hopefully. "I could create a 
panic that would empty the hall. 
And then I'd destroy my cake." 

"Don't be foolish. And stop 
whispering." 

The young post- honeymooning 
husband: "You're going to win, 
dear; I can feel it in my bones." 

"Oh, Greg, please don't try to 
fool me. I've resigned myself to 
losing." 

"You won't lose." 

"I'm afraid. Put your arm 
around me, Greg, Hold me tight 
Will you still love me if I lose?" 

"Mmmm." He kissed her shoulder. "You know, I didn't fall in 
love with you for your cooking, 
sweetheart. You don't have to 
bake any cakes for me. You're 
good enough to eat yourself." 

"He's right," thought Ronar, as 
he stared at her. "The man's right. 
Not in the way he means, but 
he's right." And suddenly, for one 
second of decision, Ronar's entire 
past seemed to flash through his 
mind. 

The young bride never knew 
why she won first prize.

and astronomer." 

You'll find some remarks about 
bis life, too: that his king (Louis 
XV) sent him to Lappland to 
measure the length of a degree 
of the meridian, and that he 
quarreled with Voltaire — as who 
didn't? — and was an able mathematician. Also it is stated that 
he was the author of a number of 
works such as Sur la figure dela terre, Lettre sur la comete de 
1742, and j4sfronomie nautique. 

All of which may tend to make 
you feel that Monsieur de Maupertuis may have been an important scientist in bis time but not 
worth much type nowadays, beyond an entry in the encyclopedia. 

BUT that is merely due to the 
fact that reference books often omit the really interesting 
things about people. Perhaps 
Maupertuis was excessively vain 
(at least all his contemporaries 
said that he was), and perhaps 
he was just a shade more quarrelsome than the other learned 
men of his time — but he was also 
full of amusing ideas and never 
hesitated to talk about them. 

When, for example, his compatriot and contemporary George 
Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, speculated about Terra australis incognita, the "Great 
Unknown Southland" which was 
then supposed to exist somewhere 



in the South Seas, Maupertuis 
jumped in without hesitation. 

Buffon, in his speculations, had 
drawn a parallel to South America. Coming from the Atlantic 
Ocean, he said, one first encounters the South American 
lowlands, inhabited by primitive 
tribes — but farther inland, where 
the mountains tower toward the 
sky, there was an area where 
there had been a high culture 
with magnificent architecture. 
Similarly, in the South Seas, we 
had found only the low islands, 
inhabited by primitive peoples. 
So when we finally managed to 
penetrate to the hypothetical 
Southland — which was assumed 
to have tall mountains too— we'd 
probably find another strange 
and so far completely unknown 
culture. 

Maupertuis agreed with Buffon so far as the idea of an unknown southern continent was 
concerned. He also subscribed to 
the assumption of high mountains in the unknown Southland 
for the simple (and to us surprising) reason that it was not at that 
time known how an iceberg is 
formed: it was thought that icebergs formed in rivers only — 
hence there had to be enormous 
rivers to produce the icebergs 
which had been seen. And the 
large rivers, in turn, demanded 
high mountain ranges to supply 
them.

31 



But there Buffon and Maupertuis parted company. Maupertuis did not expect to find a high 
culture in the Southland — or any 
culture at all! The culture of the 
Andes was high, he admitted, but 
from there on things went downhill. The islands in the Pacific 
had a lower and lower culture 
the farther one went, so obviously none was left for Southland itself — its inhabitants probably 
still had tails! All this was proclaimed, without any unnecessary 
hesitation, at Castle Sanssouci 
near Potsdam, at the dinner table 
of Frederic the Great. 

Many years later, French and 
German explorers might add 
deadpan to their reports that the 
natives were tailless ... to the 
puzzlement of readers who did 
not know just what this was 
about. 

lt/|Y MAIN reason for telling 
about Maupertuis, though, 
is that he is the father of an idea 
which has been repeatedly used 
in science fiction. He "invented" 
the tube through the center of 
the earth. 

Just what would happen if one 
had a truly bottomless well? 

Maupertuis was, as has been 
said, an excellent mathematician. 
He was also one of the men of 
science who accepted Sir Isaac 
Newton's teachings wholeheartedly. The problem of the bottom


less well became an exercise in 
mathematics. 

Obviously, if you fell into such 
a well, you'd fall faster and faster until you reached the center 
of the Earth. But you would not 
stop there, of course, for by that 
time you would have acquired 
a considerable speed, and would 
continue to "fall upward" 
through the remaining half of 
the well. Gravitation would slow 
you down to zero at the precise 
point of reaching the surface at 
the other end of the bottomless 
well — and your assistant at the 
other end could yank you sidewise onto solid ground, before 
you had time to start falling 
again, The trip — and the trip 
back, if you had no assistant — 
would take 84 minutes and 22 
seconds. The speed would be 
highest at the Earth's center, 
where it would be (expressed in 
our measurements) five miles per 
second. 

Of course, the bottomless well 
would have to be evacuated, so 
that the traveler would not be 
slowed down by air resistance. 
And the whole thing would work 
even better only if one first stopped the rotation of the Earth, for 
lacking that, one would have to 
dig the well from pole to pole. 

But in the pole-to-pole connection itself there is some hidden 
trouble: the area of the South 
Pole is about one mile above sea 



82 




 



level, while the area of the North 
Pole is virtually at sea level. 
So if you try it from north to 
south, you don't quite reach the 
other end, which is one mile 
above your farthest point. And 
if you go from south to north, 
you reach north polar sea level 
with enough residual velocity to 
rise one mile into the thin . air ! 

So you might spend some time 
in such a tunnel . . . 

Just about half a century ago, 
a Russian writer by the name of 
A. A. Rodnych (who later acquired fame as a historian of 
aviation) demonstrated that 
Maupertuis, and after him Camille Flammarion, had failed to 
extract all the humor from the 
idea. There was still a trick left 
— and Rodnych described it under the title: Subterranean selfpropelled railroad between St. 
Petersburg and Moscow; Fantastic Novel, for the Present in only 
three and moreover incomplete 
chapters. 

The point was very simple: 
there are no straight tunnels. If 
there were, you would not need 
fuel. 

Suppose a perfectly straight 
tunnel were built from Kansas 
City to San Francisco — straight 
enough to look through, even 
though you might need a telescope to make out the light 
from the other end. This tunnel 
would be straight, but nor hori


zontal: its center would be closer 
to the center of the Earth than its 
two ends. Hence, from whichever 
end you enter, you go down. A 
railroad car on a track through 
the tunnel, with its brakes released, would begin to roll. Just 
as in the bottomless well, the 
speed would increase and increase until the center of the 
tunnel was reached, at which 
point the direction would be "up" 
and the speed would begin to decrease. And if there were no friction in the bearings and on the 
rails, and no air resistance (and 
also if the wheels could stand 
the speed near the center without 
being torn apart by centrifugal 
force), the railroad car would 
reach the other end of the tunnel 
with zero speed and without having used a drop of fuel. Provided, 
of course, that both tunnel 
mouths are the same distance 
from the center of the Earth, i.e. 
same elevation above sea level. 

The timetable for such a railroad would not pose any problems: each and every train would 
arrive at its destination precisely 
42 minutes and 11 seconds after 
its brakes had been released at 
the other end . . . whether the 
tunnel was 1000 miles or a mere 
100 miles long;

— and who explained it by "attraction" and blamed it all on 
Sir Isaac Newton. 

Since I happened to be around, 
I was called upon to testify that 
Newton actually had said that 
each particle of matter in the 
Universe attracts every other 
particle. True, he did say that 
. . . but if I had been the young 
lady, I would have protested bitterly at the implication that I 
weighed several times as much 
as Mt. Everest. 

Seriously: some people do wonder why the law of universal gravitation is not noticeable in daily 
life. Science says that all bodies 
attract each other, but most of 
the time it certainly doesn't look 
that way. On the other hand, 
when two ships collide in a fog 
there are always some people 
who believe that Newton's law 
was responsible. To get the matter straight, we obviously need 
some figures: 

If we have two pieces of matter, each weighing one gram, and 
they are one centimeter apart, 
•what is the attraction between 
them? 

Answer: about 1/15,000,000 
milligram. 

One milligram, of course, is 
the thousandth part of a gram, 
and there are 28 grams in an 



ounce. If one of the two pieces 
of matter weighed 5 grams and 
the other 8 grams — and they 
were still one centimeter apart — 
their mutual attraction would be 
5 x 8 or 40 times as large as that 
of the two one gram pieces. But 
if they were three centimeters 
apart, you'd have to divide the 
attraction over the standard distance by 9 to get the proper figure. 

A nic? big orange weighs 
about 200 grams; two of them 
almost make a pound, since a 
pound is equivalent to 450 grams. 
If we place two such oranges ten 
centimeters or just about four 
inches apart, their mutual attraction then is 200 x 200 — 40,000 
divided by 10 times 10, which 
gives 400 as the result. This result has to be multiplied by 
1/15,000,000, the final' result 
being 4/150,000 or not quite 
1/40,000 milligram. This, quite 
evidently, is far too little to be 
noticeable or even measurable. 

As for the young man and the 
beautiful brunette, their mutual 
gravitational attraction must have 
been about 0.03 milligrams if 
they were originally 100 centimeters (about forty inches) 
apart. But the friction of -the 
chair on even the best polished 
hardwood floor must have been 
well over twenty pounds — so I'm 
afraid we must assume that some 
other kind of attraction was re


84 



GALAXY SCIENCi FICTION 



sponsible for that particular phenomenon. 

How about something that is 
really heavy, though — say a 
middle-sized ocean liner of 25,000 
tons weight? 

Since ocean liners as a rule 
avoid close contact, we'll say that 
they float 100,000 centimeters 
(6/10th of a mile) apart. Making the same calculation as before, which is multiplying their 
weights in grams, divided by the 
square of their distance in centimeters and multiplied by the 
constant for one gram at one 
centimeter, we find that the liners would attract each other with 
a force of 4.2 grams. Even if they 
were only a hundred yards apart, 
the attraction would amount to 
just about one pound — hardly 
enough to move a ship. So when 
two ships collide in a fog, it just 
means that they happened to be 
on a collision course. 

The figures show why the mutual gravitational attraction of 
masses does not show in daily 
life. It becomes important only 
if one of them is of planetary 
size — for example when the man 
on a slippery floor is attracted by 
the Earth. 

MORE PRIME NUMBERS 

TV"0 other item in my column 
has brought in such a large 
volume of mail as my piece on 



prime numbers in the June 1953 
GALAXY. Since more than a 
score of letters and postcards — 22 t 
by actual count, at the moment 
of writing— queried the expression on p. 70, I'll begin the discussion with that. 

Of course, as eleven correspondents stated or at least 
suspected, Fermat's expression 
suffered from a typographical 
error. The exponent of the "2" is 
not 2n but 2 U , so that the expression reads correctly 

2 <2-> 

The five readers who amiably 
called me a bungler and ignoramus will please air their grievance with the typesetter; my 
copy was correct, and I have a 
carbon copy of the article to 
prove it. 

Another twelve letters dealt 
with a fact beyond my control, 
but one which I also regret. About 
a month after my article was 
written, the NBSINA (National 
Bureau of Standards Institute for 
Numerical Analysis) on the 
premises of UCLA (University of 
California, Los Angeles) announced that SWAC (Standards 
Western Automatic Computer) 
had established higher Mersenne 
primes than the famous 2 12T — 1. 
The list of higher Mersenne 
primes reads as follows:

One Canadian reader thought 
that he had found a proof of 
Goldbach's theorem. His reasoning was as follows: disregarding 
the 2, which is the only even 
prime, a prime number must of 
necessity be an even number plus 
one: P = E + 1. Hence, if you 
add two primes p t and p 2 you 
really add E x + E 2 + 2 which 
obviously must be an even number since you add three even 
numbers together. 

Now this is proof, if one were 
needed, that the sum of two 
primes must be an even number 
— but this is not what Goldbach 
said. Goldbach stated that every 
even number is the sum of two 
primes, which sounds like the 
same statement, but actually is 
not. 

To explain the difference, let 
us assume that Goldbach's theorem is wrong. In that case, there 
should be at least one even number which is not the sum of two 
primes but merely the sum of 
two odd numbers, either of which, 
or both, are not primes. The 
proof to be found, therefore, is 
that there is no even number 
which cannot be expressed as a 
sum of two odd numbers both of 



which must be primes. 

Among the correspondence 
there were several letters asking 
me for a list of primes up to certain limits or asking where such 
a list can be gotten. I don't know 
whether the list can still be 
bought, but it should be in any 
reasonably large public library. 
Its title is List oi Prime Numbers 
from I to 10,006,721 by D. N. 
Lehmer; it is a publication of the 
Carnegie Institution of Washington, Publication Nr. 165, released 
in 1914. The recent work on the 
big Mersenne primes can be 
found in Mathematical Tables 
and Aids to Computation, Vol. 
7. p. 72 (1953).

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Will you please tell me bow to 
determine the acceleration of a 
rocket if its weight and thrust are 
known? In space, would the 
weight of a rocket affect its acceleration in any way? 

Richard Weed 
201 Harper Avenue 
Morrisville, Penna. 
The formula for determining the acceleration of a rocket 
U about as pimple as a formula 
con he. It iB P/W, where P 
stands for the thrust and W for 
tlie weight. In practical application, however, there are some 
rtiinor complications which 



86 




 



have to be taken into account, 
one of which is the direction of 
the movement. 

Let's assume that the rocket 
has just taken off and is moving vertically upward. We'll say 
that its weight is 100 lbs. and 
that its rocket motor develops 
a thrust of 300 lbs. 300 divided by 100 is, of course, 3 — 
so the rocket's "absolute" acceleration would be 3g. 

If this were the whole story, 
it would mean that the rocket 
is climbing at 3g (or accelerating 96 feet per second), so that 
at the end of each second of 
flight its velocity would be 96 
feet per second faster than at 
the beginning of that second. 
But (obviously) if the motor 
were not working, the rocket 
would fall back — which is to 
say that the Earth's gravity 
swallows up one g of the "absolute" acceleration. Hence the 
"effective" acceleration is 2g, 
and the formula has to be 
amended to read P/W — Ig. The 
interesting point here is that, 
if the rocket is manned, the 
pilot feels the absolute acceleralion while the speed increases 
according to the effective acceleration. 

The "true" effective acceleration i§ influenced by air resistance, which will vary with 
the speed of the rocket at a 
given moment and its altitude 



(or more precisely the density 
of the air at that altitude). As 
important as that is the fact 
that the weight of the rocket at 
the end of that second will be 
less than the weight at the beginning of the second. 

All this applies to empty 
space too, except that (a) there 
will be no air resistance, ( h) 
the value for the thrust is about 
15 per cent higher than the sea 
level value of the same rocket 
motor and (c) at a sufficient 
distance from the Earth the 
value for g may be noticeably 
less than the sea level value. 
For a height of 250 miles, for 
example, g has dropped from 
about 32 ft/sec 2 to 28.5 ft/sec 2 . 

Does a rocket which takes off 
toward the west have to attain a 
higher velocity relative to a point 
on the ground to reach orbital 
velocity than a rocket headed 
east? 

William J. Hunt 
2325 NE 32nd Avenue 
Portland 12, Oregon 
Let's take this one step by 
step. 

In von Braun's orbit — 1075 
miles above mean sea level— 
the rocket will have to have a 
velocity of 4.4 miles per second. If it has that velocity in 
the orbit, il doesn't matter 
whether it goes around the 
equator heading east or head


FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



87 



ing west, or along a meridian 
from pole to pole, or at any 
odd angle in between. 

Repeat : If it has that velocity 
in the orbit . . . but first it has 
to acquire this velocity. 

For simplicity's sake, let's 
suppose that take-off is at the 
equator. The equatorial diameter of the Earth is almost 
8000 miles, hence the length of 
the equator is that figure multiplied by "pi" or, in round 
figures, 24,000 miles. Since the 
Earth turns once in 24 hours, 
a point at the equator moves in 
an easterly direction at the rate 
of 1000 miles per hour or about 
0.28 miles per second. 

So if your rocket heads east 
it has, relative to the center of 
the Earth, a speed of 1000 
miles per hour before it even 
starts. If you wanted to bead 
west, you would not only lose 
that 1000 mph, but you would 
have to "kill" it first — so that 
you lose 2000 miles per hour, 
or around 0.56 miles per second. Half-a-mile a second is a 
considerable speed, even for a 
rocket, so take-off in an easterly direction is usually assumed. 

What does the term "Doppelganger" mean? 

Cpl. Z>. A. Freeman, USMC 
Fleet Post Office 
San Francisco, Calif. 



This is originally a German 
word, composed of two words 
each of which is hard to translate — which is, of course, the 
reason why it was adopted rather than translated. 

"Doppel" can mean "twice," 
and also "double" (the amount) 
or "duplicate." 

"Ganger" is best translated 
as "walker." 

The whole means: "a walking duplicate." 

The superstition attached to 
the word is that some people 
have such a "duplicate" walking around, and when they 
meet it face to face they know 
that they are doomed, with usually only three days of grace 
left to them. But in everyday 
German conversation, the term 
"Doppelganger" can be and 
often is used without mystical 
connotations. A man saying to 
a friend, "I met your Doppelganger today," merely means 
that he met somebody or saw 
somebody who looked just like 
his friend. 

Why is the nautical mile longer than the ordinary mile? Is 
there any relationship between 
the nautical mile and the metric 
kilometer? And is there such a 
thing as a "metric mile"?

If anybody knows the origin 
of the English mile, I wish he'd 
write me, for as far as I know 
the mile — 1760 yards or 5280 
feet long — is a unit which just 
happened. 

The nautical mile, however, 
has a reason ; its length is 
l/60th of one degree at the 
equator. 

As for the kilometer, it also 
has a reason: it is 1/1 0,000th 
of the distance of a point on 
the equator from either pole — 
Or rather it is supposed to be, 
for more recent measurements 
have shown a small deviation 
from that figure. 

There is no "metric mile"; 
but for a while geographers 
used a unit which they called 
the "geographic mile,** which 
corresponded to 1/1 5th of a 
degree at the equator. 

The various "national" miles 
are as uncertain in origin as 
the English mile, though some 



of them happen to come fairly 
close to the old geographic 
mile. To compare them, the 
kilometer has been used as the 
unit in the following table : 

1 English mile 1.609 km. 
1 nautical mile 1.852 km. 
1 geographic mile 7.420 km. 
1 German mile 7.500 km. 
1 Danish mile 7.582 km. 
1 Swedish mile 10.688 km. 
1 Norwegian mile 

11.295 km. 

The Russian rerst measured 
1.066 kilometers (or 0.6629 
miles), but like all the other 
old miles given, it is now obsolete. The only units in use 
internationally now are the 
kilometer, the English mile, 
and the nautical mile; but the 
French nautical mile is three 
times as long as the nautical 
mile of everybody else. Don't 
ask me why.

the 

carnivore 

By G. A. MORRIS 



Why were they apologetic? It 
wasn't their fault that they 
came to Earth much too late. 



THE beings stood around 
my bed in airsuits like skisuits, with globes over their 
heads like upside-down fishbowls. 
It was all like a masquerade, with 
odd costumes and funny masks. 

I know that the masks are 
their faces, but I argue with them 
and find I think as if I am arguing with humans behind the 
masks. They are people. I recognize people and whether I am 



going to like this person or that 
person by something in the way 
they move and how they get excited when they talk ; and I know 
that I like these people in a 
motherly sort of way. You have 
to feel motherly toward them, I 
guess. 

They all remind me of Ronny, 
a medical student I knew once. 
He was small and round and 
eager. You had to like him, but 
you couldn't take him very seriously. He was a pacifist; he wrote 
poetry and pulled it out to read 
aloud at ill-timed moments; and 
he stuttered when he talked too 
fast.

They are like that, all fright 
and gentleness. 

T am not the only survivor — 
they have explained that — 
but I am the first they found, 
and the least damaged, the one 
they have chosen to represent the 
human race to them. They stand 
around my bed and answer questions, and are nice to me when I 
argue with them. 

All in a group they look halfway between a delegation of nations and an ark, one of each, big 
and small, thick and thin, four 
arms or wings, all shapes and 
colors in fur and skin and feathers. 

I can picture them in their 
UN of the Universe, making 
speeches in their different languages, listening patiently without understanding each other's 
different problems, boring each 
other and being too polite to 
yawn. 

They are polite, so polite I almost feel they are afraid of me, 
and I want to reassure them. 

But I talk as if I were angry. 
I can't help it, because if things 
had only been a little different 
. . . "Why couldn't you have come 
sooner? Why couldn't you have 
tried to stop it before it happened, or at least come sooner, afterward . . .?" 

If they had come sooner to 
where the workers of the Nevada 



power pile starved slowly behind their protecting walls of lead 
— if they had looked sooner for 
survivors of the dust with which 
the nations of the world had slain 
each other — George Craig would 
be alive. He died before they 
came. He was my co-worker, and 
I loved him. 

We had gone down together, 
passing door by door the automatic safeguards of the plant, 
which were supposed to protect 
the people on the outside from 
the radioactive danger from the 
inside — but the danger of a 
failure of politics was far more 
real than the danger of failure 
in the science of the power pile, 
and that had not been calculated 
by the builders. We were far underground when the first radioactivity in the air outside had 
shut all the heavy, lead-shielded 
automatic doors between us and 
the outside. 

We were safe. And we starved 
there. 

"Why didn't you come sooner?" 
1 wonder if they know or guess 
how I feel. My questions are not 
questions, but I have to ask them. 
He is dead. I don't mean to reproach them — they look well 
meaning and kindly — but I feel 
as if, somehow, knowing why it 
happened could make it stop, 
could let me turn the clock back 
and make it happen differently. If 
I could have signaled them, so 



THE CARNIVORE

they would have come just a little 
sooner. 

They look at one another, turning their funny-face heads uneasily, moving back and forth, 
but no one will answer. 

The world is dead . . . George 
is dead, that thin, pathetic creature with the bones showing 
through his skin that he was when 
we sat still at the last with our 
hands touching, thinking there 
were people outside who had forgotten us, hoping they would remember. We didn't guess that 
the world was dead, blanketed in 
radiating dust outside. Politics 
had killed it. 

These beings around me, they 
had been watching, seeing what 
was going to happen to our world, 
listening to our radios from their 
small settlements on the other 
planets of the Solar System. They 
had seen the doom of war coming. They represented stellar civilizations of great power and technology, and with populations that 
would have made ours seem a 
small village; they were stronger 
than we were, and yet they had 
done nothing. 

"Why didn't you stop us? You 
ctould have stopped us." 

A RABBITY one who is closer 
than the others backs away, 
gesturing politely that he is giving room for someone else to 
speak, but he looks guilty and 



will not look at me with his big 
round eyes. I still feel weak and 
dizzy. It is*hard to think, but I 
feel as if they are hiding a secret. 

A doelike one hesitates and 
comes closer to my bed. "We discussed it ... we voted . . It 
talks through a microphone in 
its helmet with a soft lisping accent that I think comes from the 
shape of its mouth. It has a muzzle and very soft, dainty, long 
nibbling lips like a deer that nibbles on twigs and buds. 

"We were afraid," adds one 
who looks like a bear. 

"To us the future was very terrible," says one who looks as if it 
might have descended from some 
sort of large bird like a penguin. 
"So much — Your weapons were 
very terrible." 

Now they all talk at once, 
crowding about my bed, apologizing. "So much killing. It hurt 
to know about. But your people 
didn't seem to mind." 

"We were afraid." 

"And in your fiction," the doelike one lisped, "I saw plays from 
your amusement machines which 
said that the discovery of beings 
in space would save you from 
war, not because you would let 
us bring friendship and teach 
peace, but because the human 
race would unite in hatred of the 
outsiders. They would forget their 
hatred of each other only in a 
new and more terrible war with

us." Its voice breaks in a squeak 
and it turns its face away from 
me. 

"You were about to come out 
into space. We were wondering 
how to hide!" That is a quicktalking one, as small as a child. 
He looks as if he might have 
descended from a bat — gray 
silken fur on his pointed face, big 
night-seeing eyes, and big sensitive ears, with a humped shape 
on the back of his airsuit which 
might be folded wings. "We were 
trying to conceal where we had 
built, so that humans would not 
guess we were near and look for 
us." 

They are ashamed of their fear, 
for because of it they broke all 
the kindly laws of their civilizations, restrained all the pity and 
gentleness I see in them, and let 
us destroy ourselves, 

I am beginning to feel more 
awake and to see more clearly. 
And I am beginning to feel sorry 
for them, for I can see why they 
are afraid. 

They are herbivores. I remember the meaning of shapes. In the 
paths of evolution there are grass 
eaters and berry eaters and root 
diggers. Each has its functional 
shape of face and neck — and its 
wide, startled-looking eyes to see 
and run away from the hunters. 
In all their racial history they 
have never killed to eat. They 
have been killed and eaten, or 



run away, and they evolved to 
intelligence by selection. Those 
lived who succeeded in running 
away from carnivores like lions, 
hawks, and men. 

T look up, and they turn their 
eyes and heads in quick embarrassed motion, not meeting my 
eye. The rabbity one is nearest 
and I reach out to touch him, 
pleased because I am growing 
strong enough now to move my 
arms. He looks at me and I ask 
the question: "Are there any 
carnivores — flesh eaters — among 
you?" 

He hesitates, moving his lips 
as if searching for tactful words. 
"We have never found any that 
were civilized. We have frequently found them in caves and tents 
fighting each other. Sometimes 
we find them fighting each other 
with the ruins of cities around 
them, but they are always savages." 

The bearlike one said heavily, 
"It might be that carnivores 
evolve more rapidly and tend 
toward intelligence more often, 
for we find radioactive planets 
without life, and places like the 
place you call your asteroid belt, 
where a planet should be — but 
there are only scattered fragments 
of planet, pieces that look as if a 
planet had been blown apart. We 
think that usually . . ." He looked 
at me uncertainly, beginning to 



THE CARNIVORE 



fumble his words. "We think . . ." 

"Yours is the only carnivorous 
race we have found that was — 
civilized, that had a science and 
was going to come out into 
space," the doelike one interrupted softly. "We were afraid." 

They seem to be apologizing. 

The rabbity one, who seems to 
be chosen as the leader in speaking to me, says, "We will give you 
anything you want. Anything we 
are able to give you." 

They mean it. We survivors 
will be privileged people, with a 
key to all the cities, everything 
free. Their sincerity is wonderful, 
but puzzling. Are they trying to 
atone for the thing they feel was 
a crime; that they allowed humanity to murder itself, and lost 
to the Galaxy the richness of a 
race ? Is this why they are so 
generous? 

Perhaps then they will help the 
race to get started again. The 
records are not lost. The few survivors can eventually repopulate 
Earth. Under the tutelage of 
these peaceable races, without the 
stress of division into nations, we 
will flower as a race. No children 
of mine to the furthest descendant 
will ever make war again. This 
much of a lesson we have learned. 

These timid beings do not realize how much humanity has 
wanted peace. They do not know 
how reluctantly we were forced 
and trapped by old institutions 



and warped tangles of politics to 
which we could see no answer. 
We are not naturally savage. We 
are not savage when approached 
as individuals. Perhaps they 
know this, but are afraid anyhow, 
instinctive fear rising up from the 
blood of their hunted, frightened 
forebears. 

TTHE human race will be a good 
partner to these races. Even 
recovering from starvation as I 
am, I can feel in myself an energy 
they do not have. The savage in 
me and my race is a creative 
thing, for in those who have been 
educated as I was it is a controlled savagery which attacks 
and destroys only problems and 
obstacles, never people. Any human raised outside of the political traditions that the race' 
inherited from its bloodstained 
childhood would be as friendly 
and ready for friendship as I am 
toward these beings. I could never 
hurt these pleasant, overgrown 
bunnies and squirrels. 

"We will do everything we can 
to make up for ... we will try to 
help," says the bunny, stumbling 
over the English, but civilized 
and cordial and kind. 

I sit up suddenly, reaching out 
impulsively to shake his hand. 
Suddenly frightened he leaps 
back. All of them step back, 
glancing behind them as though 
making sure of the avenue of 



THE CARNIVORE 



95 



escape. Their big luminous eyes 
widen and glance rapidly from 
me to the doors, frightened. 

They must think I am about to 
leap out of bed and pounce on 
them and eat them. I am about 
to laugh and reassure them, about 
to say that all I want from them 
is friendship, when I feel a twinge 
in my abdomen from the sudden 
motion. I touch it with one hand 
under the bedclothes. 

There is the scar of an incision 
there, almost healed. An operation. The weakness I am recovering from is more than the weakness of starvation. 

For only half a second I do not 
understand; then I see why they 
looked ashamed.

have been made sterile. There

we die. 

I am frozen, one hand still extended to grasp the hand of the

words still half formed. 

There will be time for anger 
or grief later, for now, in this instant, I can understand. They are 
probably quite right. 

We were carnivores. 

I know, because, at this moment of hatred, I could kill them 
all.

take over Earth. Even when they 
are pointed out, they arouse 
skepticism. But don't you see? 
They're meant to! 

Paper clips, rubber bands, 
strings, pencils, glue, all the deliberately trivial rest . . . 

Huge industries, employing 
thousands of people, turning out 
countless clips, hangers, pencils, 
miles of string . . . 

Paying wages and taxes . . . 

And nobody buys the products! 

But somebody must. We all 
have them and they aren't gifts 
of the manufacturers, or there 
would be no wages and taxes. 

The Russians? No, they have 
them, too, and so must also be 
potential — what? Victims? 

There is but one answer: 

Extraterrestrials! 

They — or their human agents 
or dupes — are cleverly supplying 
us all with these safe-seeming 
tools of conquest. 

How will the plan work? See 
for yourself. 

• The items are all genuine; 
many of them even carry the 
Good Housekeeping seal of approval. 

• They may or may not have 
been invented by aliens, but 
that's not the point now — the industries are kept going by alien 
funds. 

• Step by step, we have been 
made increasingly dependent on 



these products, so dependent that 
even the most skeptical must 
blanch at this prospect: 

What would happen if everyone who needed a paper clip, 
rubber band, pencil, string or 
mucilage suddenly could not Sod 
any? 

Documents strewn around for 
lack of clips or rubber bands; 
parcels unwrapped because there 
is no paper or string; nothing 
pasted or glued together; orders 
and notes left unwritten . . . 

Now do you see the brilliant 
simplicity of the scheme? 

Withdraw these items abruptly and the armies of the world 
cannot march, the governments 
will fall apart, civilian populations will be unable to pack up 
and escape. 

Disintegration rays, atomic 
bombs, suicide ships from space 
with hydrogen warheads — 

There are defenses against such 
overt weapons. 

But what defense is there for 
a world suddenly deprived of 
pencils and nails, string and glue 
and wrapping paper? 

We could buy our own and 
smash the conspiracy. 

As a solution, ifs too drastic 
— it violates the human instinct 
of collecting junk for possible 
emergency. 

I hope somebody has a better 
answer.

Origins 

of Galactic Etiquette 



By EDWARD WELLEN 

Illustrated by STONE 

Take this handy guide along 
on your Galactic jaunis—to 
avoid death— or even worse? 



PREFATORY NOTE 



MAN rippled out through 
the Galaxy, learning. He 
was learning — often the 
hard way — to abandon the set 
notions of morality that had conditioned him. He was learning 
that the guiding hand of the past 
could not reach from star to star. 
He was learning to evaluate new 
situations arising out of changed 
conditions. In sum, he was learning that etiquette varies with environment. 



At first, breaches of etiquette 
were all too common. The trouble 
they caused resulted largely from 
twin errors. The offender erred 
in failing to use his intelligence 
to determine the proper social 
expedient; and the one taking 
offense erred in failing to allow 
for the blunderer's ignorance. 

To reconcile conflicting ways 
of nf e — without allowing one to 
impose its beliefs, shames, and 
fears upon another — is the Calac


98 




 



tic Council's mission. In 2937 the 
Galactic Council consolidated its 
counseling services into the Department of Etiquette. It commissioned experts with a background of comparative studies in 
ecology, sociology, and psychology. 

These experts foofc the generic 
title of MLE, from the initials 
of Manners, Logic, Expediency — ■ 
not, as many think, from Emily 
Post, a probably mythical authority on Terran etiquette. 

The following examples of Galactic etiquette are a cross-section 
of MLE-ing in its formative 
stage. 

FROM the microfiles of MLE 
Zel Pret (2916-3040), dean of 
the Derben XI MLEs. 

Question: Three years ago a 
friend of mine disappeared. He 
had been working on a selfpopping cereal when it exploded. 
He left no trace and so we held 
mourning rites over the spot we 
believed he had last occupied. 

Six months ago he reappeared. 
But, naturally, until he goes 
through the birth ceremony, we 
must religiously follow the custom of "not seeing" him. 

He is taking unfair advantage 
of his "invisibility." Judging by 
his mischief-making, I suspect 
that he staged the explosion to 
cover his leaving — and I shudder 
to think of what he must have 

ORIGINS OF GALACTIC E 



done during those missing years. 

Now he walks right into our 
houses, helps himself to our best 
liquor, snatches food from our 
grasp, and pinches our wives. And 
he caps these indignities by tying 
our eye -stalks into neat bows, 
turning our "unseeing" eyes upon 
ourselves. 

What do you advise? 

Fit-to-be-tied. 

Answer : You have a knotty 
problem, Fit -to -be -tied. To see 
how to cut the knot, simply follow the lesson you learn from the 
following example. 

Alusded Anstef (2613-2709), a 
Prubnild III feather magnate 
who sculpted for a hobby, taught 
his son Rusica to believe in his 
philosophy, which held that the 




I Q U E T T E 99 



mind never can gather facts 
enough to be sure that one course 
of action is wiser than another — 
that what now seems good may 
in the long run prove bad. 

One day in 2679 Alusded stood 
on a high scaffold in his studio. 
He was absorbedly putting the 
Finishing touches to a colossal 
statue. He stepped back to admire his work. He fell. 

The sudden stop didn't kill 
him ... as he belonged to a 
metallic race, it merely dented 
him. Shakily, he grasped the 
scaffolding to pull himself upright. The scaffolding toppled. It 
struck the top of his head. Again 
his iron constitution saved his 
life — but as he happened to be 
slanting in the right position relative to the magnetic lines of force 
of the planet, the blow permanently magnetized him. 

TTE lay dazed for a while. 

Then his head cleared and 
he started to get up. His heart 
bonged when he found himself 
stuck to the steel flooring. He 
strained, but couldn't pry himself loose. He needed help, and 
called out. 

He grimaced at the undignified 
sight he presented, but welcomed 
the ring of his son Rusica's footsteps. Somewhat bad-temperedly, 
he explained what had happened. 

Rusica stood watching his 
father thoughtfully. Then he 



slowly reflected aloud. 

"Analyzing the situation," he 
said, "I must weigh my desires 
and good intentions against unforeseeable effects." 

By now, adding to Alusded's 
embarrassment, a group of his 
friends had gathered. They listened — somi- impatiently, some 
amusedly — to Rusica's careful 
reasoning. 

At last, Rusica made up his 
mind. Taking the long view, he 
found himself unable to judge 
whether he would harm or help 
his father and/or society by acting — and so, uncertain that good 
would come of freeing his father 
from the floor, he went out. 

Less philosophical, three of 
Alusded's friends came closer to 
take hold of the fallen magnate. 
Three clangs echoed through the 
room — and the three friends were 
sticking to Alusded. 

The remaining friends wisely 
used ropes to tug loose and sort 
out the quartet. Alusded gratefully wanted to shake hands with 
his rescuers, but they moved out 
of reach, wary of his personal 
magnetism. They suggested that 
he undergo heat and so lose his 
drawing power. 

Among themselves they muttered about Rusica's unfilial conduct. But Alusded, proud that his 
teachings had taken, resoundingly 
praised Rusica for sticking to 
them. 



100 




 



Now, Fit-to-be-tied, you and I 
know that Alusded was rationalizing a defeat. His case shows 
how a stern doctrine may boomerang. Your problem will answer 
itself, I believe, when your "not 
seeing" makes you blunder into 
your friend in ways I leave to 
your imagination. Of course, I 
don't counsel that you run him 
down or through. But after he 
experiences two or three close 
calls he will decide to arrange 
for his rebirth. 

FROM the microfiles of MLE 
Atrata Beritar (2966-3187), 
Cygnian expert; author of the 
famous Afe/anocoryp/i/c Memoirs. 

Question: My neighbor hovers 
about, making disparaging remarks while I'm bleaching or 
dyeing my feathers. It's nearly 
moulting time and I'm afraid 
she'll want to come along when 
I shop for falsies. Would it be 
proper for me to tell her to go 
preen herself? ' 

Ruffled. 

Answer: Patience, Ruffled. If 
your neighbor's kibitzing becomes overly annoying, you may 
with propriety ask her to desist. 
However, you'll do well to think 
of this: there are occasions when 
it's perfectly correct for one to 
kibitz. 

For example, when a Groom 



bian philosopher seems lost in 
abstract thought, other Groombians deliberately make all manner of distracting sounds and 
gestures. They do this to remind 
him of the omnipresence of environment. 

Largely speaking, of course, 
most Galactic societies frown on 
derogatory kibitzing, because of 
the totalitarian, taint clinging to 
even such a modified form of 
spying. But in all societies, constructive kibitzing has become acceptable ever since 2516. 

In that year, a scout ship of 
the University of Capella Expedition crashed in the wilderness of 
Deneb IX. A twisted beam pinned 
the scout in the wreckage. Only 
the thrust of his arms held the 



ORIGINS OF GALACTIC ETIQUETTE 



101 



beam from crushing his chest. 
But his arms soon tired, and the 
weight of the beam slowly but 
inexorably settled. 

The magnetic storm that had 
caused the crash made it impossible for the command ship to 
get a fix on the lost scout. So 
when the scout failed to return 
or report, search parties set out 
on the ground to cover the area 
from opposite ends. 

AS they made their way toward each other, both parties 
became self-consciously aware of 
an arboreal creature that flitted 
back and forth between them. 
First it would hover over Search 
Party A, and with bright beady 
eyes watch the members blasting 
their way through the brush. 
Then it would swing back to give 
its attention to Search Party B. 

These bursts of scrutiny were 
distracting to the Capellans. They 
were itching to scare off the creature. But respect for -all forms 
of life channeled their energy into 
the search for the rapidly weakening scout. 

After several hours of shuttling, 
the arboreal being diffidently addressed the members of Search 
Party B. An alien voice appeared 
to creep into their thoughts. It 
said, "Pardon me for intruding 
upon your minds, but would it be 
sporting if I were to tell you 
whether or not you are warm?" 



So, Ruffled, you see how one 
being may be in a position to do 
others a better turn than anyone 
imagines. You see how the others 
may be in a position to deprive 
themselves of that aid. Fortunately, in this case everything 
worked out happily. At length, 
but happily. But you see how 
easy it is for beings to fail to 
read each other's purposes. 

So try to keep from letting 
your annoyance with your neighbor's fault-finding open a breach 
between you. Remember what 
birds of a feather must do. 

FROM the microfiles of MLE 
Naea Muc (3054-3197), who 
won fame in the Cymini sector. 

Question : I recently had a 
pleasant visit at the Vernac 
branch of the Galactic Museum. 
I saw — and rather fell in love 
with — an outer garment made of 
animal pelts. I'd like to synthesize a duplicate of it. Would 
such a garment be socially acceptable today? 

Madcap. 

.Answer: Stick to non-objective 
covering, Madcap. Otherwise you 
violate a long-standing taboo. 

This usage traces back to the 
disappearance of Katherine Roman, Miss Terra of 2403. Among 
the prizes she won when she 
gained the title was a mutatcdcat coat worth four kilocredits. 



102 




 



She wore it while enjoying another prize, a trip around the 
Galaxy. She never completed the 
trip, however, for she disappeared 
while on a stopover on Tasinack. 

The natives of Tasinack are a 
fur-bearing race. They turned out 
in honor of Katherine's muchpublicized visit in a crowd that 
spread over the spaceport like a 
rug. Unfortunately, Katherine's 
appearance rubbed the nap the 
wrong way. She stepped out of 
the spaceship and waved and 
smiled at the Tasinackians, and 
while their standards of beauty 
found Katherine wanting, they 
were anxious to make her feel 
welcome and so they had rehearsed spontaneous cheering for 
days. But when they saw that 
her coat consisted of pelts very 




like their own, their cheers 
changed to catcalls. 

Katherine's chaperone sensed 
the reason for the resentment and 
urged her to keep the fur coat 
out of sight during the stopover. 
Katherine reluctantly agreed. 

When they reached the hostelry, Katherine started to put the ' 
coat away, lingering over the 
packing process. She couldn't resist giving the soft, rich fur one 
last stroke. 

And that undid the effect of 
her chaperone's urging. 

Deaf to all warnings and pleas, 
Katherine wrapped herself in her 
fur coat and went out into the 
streets to do a bit of sightseeing. 
She didn't return. And no Terran eye ever again saw Miss 
Terra of 2403 alive. 

The natives of Tasinack held 
contests too. Tasinack's Bestdressed Female of 2404 won the 
title by sporting a supple jacket 
of something remarkably like humanoid skin. 

That's why I urge you to drop 
your idea of synthesizing a fur 
coat, Madcap. Only when you've 
inherited one is it in good taste 
for you to wear a fur coat.

IV expert who also created a stir 
as a musician. 

Question: I've just come back 
from running a trading post on 



ORIGINS OF GALACTIC ETIQUETTE 



103 




Tontowe II. I've come back 
empty-handed. Sessuly, my competitor, has come back with all 
his arms full. And I can't understand why. 

I remember the shock I felt 
when I first saw Sessuly acting 
boorishly. There he stood, in the 
middle of a horde of bellowing 
natives. He was nodding and smiling as if he understood what they 
were bellowing. And all the while 
he was rudely holding fingers in 
his ears, shutting out the deafening blast that passes for talk. 

I laughed to myself, because 
I was sure he was taking the 
wrong tack. It came as a blow 
when he began reaping a windfall. The natives were storming 
him with trade goods and leaving 



my trading post strictly alone. 

For a long time I held to my 
course of politeness. 1 couldn't 
bring myself to veer about and 
follow Sessuly's example. And I 
saw my threshold remaining uncrossed and my goods becoming 
shopworn. 

Finally I made up my mind : if 
rudeness was etiquette on Tontowe II, 1 would outboor Sessuly. 
And so, though it scandalized me, 
I forced myself to make awkward attempts at being rude. I 
thumbed my tongue and stuck 
out my nose at the natives. I 
elbowed and shouldered them 
aside. I tried to drown them out 
with a vast bellowing of my own, 
until my lungs began to leak. 
But all in vain. My trade goods 
stayed becalmed on the shelf. 

What's the matter? Isn't etiquette what if s puffed up to be? 

Deflated. 

Answer: How did you wangle 
your trading permit? Sessuly had 
the good sense to bone up on the 
folkways of Tontowe II. You 
didn't. 

You leaped wrongly when you 
concluded that Sessuly was being rude. 

You remind me of Lene Han 
(2844-2880), of Lorsa I. While 
visiting Prah he heard cries of 
pain that shook him. The cries 
led him to a hut where a Prahi 
was beating his frail mate bru


104 




 



tally. Han rushed in to stop the 
wife-beater. When he recovered 
from the wife's flesh-clawing and 
hair-pulling attack on him, Han 
found out that the frail wife had 
wanted the beating because she 
was frail. Her broken bones would 
knit beautifully and- the callus 
that formed would strengthen 
them. This is how the females of 
Prah become fit for the heavy 
work they do. 

You, too, rushed in. You should 
have learned that the natives of 
Tontowe II speak a polyphonic 
form of double talk. The bellowing you heard was really a combining of two voices, a bass and 
a treble. 

The native uses his bass voice 
to give his running commentary 
on long-term space-time factors 
— climate, social forces, and the 
like. He uses his treble voice to 
deal with matters of immediate 
concern, such as trading. 

The bass is — in the ears of a 
non-Tontower — so loud that it 
overpowers the treble. 

When Sessuly stuck his fingers 
in his ears he was making practical use of a simple principle: 
to hear speech above a loud continuous noise, plug your ears. 

Buy ear plugs, Deflated, and 
try Tontowe II again. 

FROM the microfiles of MLE 
Inili Sostota (3274-3386) , 
Seden X expert, who redeemed 



himself many times over after 
failing in this case. 

Question : My problem becomes more pressing as my spaceship nears your planet. Some 
five months ago I hastily snapped 
shut a yawn. I was in the middle 
of a spaceship that was in the 
middle of nowhere — and I was 
hearing meaningful tapping. 

I tracked the sound to a porthole. I looked out. I saw nothing 
but space. The tapping continued. 
I stepped up the magnification of 
the porthole — and saw the tappers. They were spores. The tapping told me that inside each 
thick tough shell was a nucleated 
mass of thinking protoplasm with 
a food reserve of starch. 

For some time I had been 
yawning out of boredom, and so 
I eagerly welcomed company — ■ 
even if that company was protoplasm that communicated by 
Galactic Morse. Phrasing their 
query most politely, they asked 
me to let them land on my ship. 
I tapped back a warm welcome. 

But as the months dragged 
along I lost interest in what the 
spores had on tap to talk about. 
We really have nothing in common. What's more, they were — 
and still are — generating their 
own atmosphere, and are budding 
and fissioning wildly all over the 
hull. 

I'm concerned. This cluster of 
space barnacles threatens to im


ORIGINS OF GALACTIC ETIQUETTE 



105 




pair the efficiency of an aerodynamic landing. 

How can I get rid of them now 
without negating my original welcoming of them? 

Host. 

Answer: Frankly, Host, I know 
nothing about the ways of the 
spores of space. But I hazard the 
following. When you point out 
that they are likely to become 
incandescent along with your 
spaceship, you will quickly lose 
your guests. 

{Postscript: How unfortunate, 
Host followed my advice, which 
I based on insufficient data. 
Actually, his spaceship had 
passed through a stream of cosmic dust, resulting in millions of 
infinitesimal punctures. He was 



unaware that the self-sealing 
walls failed him. Oxygen seeped 
out. His yawning was due more 
to oxygen loss than* to boredom. 
Unfortunately, the spores were 
polite — much too much so to put 
him in their debt by telling him 
that they had sensed his danger 
and had come to plug the holes 
with themselves. They left for this 
reason, rather than because they 
were looking to their own safety. 
They converted some of their 
food reserve of starch into explosive and blasted off into deep 
space. Soon Host began to yawn 
again.)

Question: I recently lost a valuable ologog. A Cetian found it 
and graciously returned it. When 
I gushed my gratitude, the Cetian 
stomped on my tail and stormed 
out. What do you think of such 
barbarity? 

Sore. 

Answer: Simmer down, Sore. 
You were at fault. Following this 
rule should help you in the future: it's better form to express / 
one's thanks to one's benefactor 
in writing than to do so in person. There are various reasons for 
this. 

Many races become embarrassed at a show of gratitude; 



106 




 




they have merely done their duty. 
Others are also merely doing their 
duty, but resent the trouble another's carelessness puts them to. 
Still others would place a Freudian interpretation upon your losing an object you consciously 
value; they would consider your 
effusive thanks evidence of unconscious hypocrisy. 

Your Cetian falls into the lastcited category. 

On the other hand, gratitude 
so delights a Siriute that he will 
filch an object over and over 
again in order to enjoy the pleasure of returning it. 

But perhaps the gravest reason 
for heeding this rule dates back 
to Dila Mirg (2519-2667). 

To his fellow Achernari, Dila 



Mirg was a particularly handsome specimen. To humanoids, 
however, his appearance was 
horrifying. Solarians, especially, 
found the sight of Mirg so chill* 
ing that they froze in terror, 

The effect on Mirg was just as 
great — but in his case the effect 
was one of intense hurt, for he 
was extremely sensitive to the reaction of others to himself. His 
only release for the emotional 
pressure on his wounded ego was 
to lash out with an eely tentacle. 
This tentacle was of modified 
muscular tissue; on excitation 
through the nervous system, it 
discharged a powerful electric 
shock. 

TN 2602, Mirg in this manner 
electrocuted a terrified Terran 
he encountered while the spaceship he astrogated lay docked on 
Callisto. To escape his angry pursuers, he stowed aboard a Procyon-bound freighter just before it 
blasted off. 

Mirg managed to stay hidden 
during the early part of the trip. 
But when he saw Mallory Quayle 
— Mate and sole Terran in the 
ship's complement — in danger, 
Mirg impulsively gave away his 
presence and risked his life to 
save Quayle's. From his hiding 
place Mirg watched Quayle 
brush against a bare live wire, 
Instantly, Mirg slithered to the 
rescue. 



ORIGINS OF GALACTIC ETIQUETTE 



107 



He shorted the circuit with his 
own body. 

There was a blinding flash. 

Mirg blew out a fuse gland, 
but his regenerative powers would 
soon put him on the mend. Quayle 
suffered nothing worse than facial 
burns. 

Brimming with gratitude, 
Quayle fumed until he could remove his blindfolding bandages 
and thank his rescuer face to 
face. 

When the moment came, 
Quayle hurried to the astrogation 
room, where Mirg was now working his passage. 

As he laid eyes on Jtfirg, 
Quayle choked on the words of 
thanks he had prepared. Terror 
transfixed him. 

Hurt, Mirg lashed out with his 
tentacle. 

Like you, Sore, Quayle neglected to sound his benefactor's 
depths, neglected to ask about 
him. If Quayle had known in 
advance about Mirg's peculiarities and the effect they would 
have on himself, he would have 
been prepared. Then he might 
have averted his eyes while delivering his thanks. He might 
even have steeled himself to master the ordeal of looking squarely 
at Mirg. Or, better yet, he might 
have dropped Mirg a note of 
thanks, as you should always 
do in the future.

Illustrated by KNO'H 

With a Vengeance 

By J. B. WOODLEY 

Keep this in mind in teaching 
apprentices: They are future 
journeymen — and even masters! 



October 10, 2119 
New San Francisco 

TODAY, at precisely 9:50 
a.m., Kyle became First 
Imperator of Terra. His 
coup was so fantastically direct 



and facile that. I am almost 
tempted to believe that old cliche 
"the time was right." 

Well, however badly it can be 
expressed, I suppose the world 
was ripe for this sort of thing. I 



WITH A VENGEANCE 



109 



can remember when much the 
same used to happen in elections. 
One man would win over another 
by a tremendous majority, and 
historians would then set about 
to show how "the time was right." 

Why do I persist in tormenting 
myself with that phrase! Analytically, I might say I resent this 
new aristocracy of politics. Specifically, I might say I resent 
Kyle. 

And both are true, both are 
true. 

This swing, though, to absolute 
monarchy, complete with the installation of the Kyle Dynasty — 
damn him ! This is something 
which psychologists, not historians, must explain. Has the age 
of the Common Man, so bravely 
flaunted for over one hundred 
years, truly come to nothing? 
Would people really prefer a figurehead and a symbol of undisputed authority? 

In this instance, one may again 
conclude that "the time was 
right." Contact with planets like 
Mars and Venus undoubtedly had 
its influence. I must confess that 
the televised audiences with the 
Mrit of Venus and the Znam of 
Mars cfio* make Terra's President 
— I should say, late President — 
look a bit seedy. I daresay there 
is such a thing as a too common 
Common Man. 

Kyle was such, twenty years 
ago. His name wasn't Kyle then, 



although it was something very 
like that. I must see if any of the 
old ledgers are about! I'd like to 
see what the Imperator's name 
was when His Most Imperial 
Majesty was an apprenticed nobody!

T FOUND it! Buried in stacks 
of dust behind the old printing press that was once the heart 
of my Beacon-Sentinel. There 
were others there too, Spent a 
delightful morning with them, 
reading back through those old 
account books. 

I wonder whatever happened to 
Hastings? And Drew? Best linotype men I ever had. They became pilots, or something, as I 
recall. Too bad, too bad. They 
could have had such brilliant 
futures, both of them. Why they 
felt they must ally themselves 
with the non-thinking, muscleflexing variety of mankind — of 
which our Ruler is an excellent 
example — I'll never know. 

Ah, yes, Kyle! In those days 
he was Kilmer Jones. I don't remember him too well, actually, 
except for the day I fired him. 

I suppose he was right in 
changing his name. We couldn't 
very well have an Imperator 
named Kilmer the First, or Jones 
the First. Much too common, not 
at all in keeping. 



no 




 



Gawky fellow — that Kilmer. 
When Bard brought me a sample 
of his work — I guess I'll have to 
call it that — we both had a good 
laugh over it! Atrocious spelling! 
Couldn't follow the proofreader's 
marks. Indeed, I wonder if the 
fellow could even read! The 
punctuation! And the grammar! 

I called the boy to the office 
that morning — or was it the next 
day? No matter. I called him in 
and told him, as kindly as possible, that I thought there were 
other vocations to which he might 
be better suited. The irony of it! 
Kilmer Jones — Kyle I! 

And he stood there, I remember, with those seventeen-yearold hands that were all knuckles 
and bone and chapped skin, 
twisting those hands and shifting 
his weight from one foot to the 
other. 

"Please, Mr. Booth," he said, 
his voice cracking. "I ain't got no 
other job in mind. I wanna be a 
noospaper man. I ain't got no — " 

If not for that "ain't got no," I 
think I might have relented. But 
no one is going to ruin the English language as he did! Not in 
my offices! 

I took him to task severely for 
his offensive usage, outlined a 
correct example of what he had 
attempted to say, gave him a 
brief lesson in the history of the 
tongue, and explained why it had 
been chosen as the official Terran 



speech. I think my conclusion 
was, "You'll be much better off 
in a position which requires you 
to quote neither Milton nor 
Shakespeare nor any author save 
possibly those who write the 
comic strips." 

"Got no training," he said 
softly. (I supposed it was to keep 
his voice from exhibiting its 
usual adolescent gymnastics.) 

I shuddered slightly, I remember. "You mean, 'I have no training.' " 

"Yeah . . ." softly again. "Yeah, 
Mr. Booth." 

"Yes!" I cried impatiently. 
"Not 'y ea n.' but yes!" 

I searched for his severance pay 
on my desk, wondering who the 
devil had hired him in the first 
place. Gave him three weeks pay, 
as I recall it, one more than 
necessary. 

Unmannerly pup! He just stood 
there for a minute and then finally left without even a "Thank 
you," or "Good-by." 

And this is the man who is 
Kyle the First, Ruler of Terra at 
the age of thirty -seven! I wonder 
what he is like now . . . 

January 1, 1 
New San Francisco 
rpHERE is no longer any need 
to wonder. Surprisingly few 
heads have rolled, but apparently 
Jonesy chooses to exhibit his 
power in other ways. 



WITH A VENGEANCE 



Thanksgiving Day, a custom 
preserved in certain portions of 
the Directorate of North America, is three weeks away — even 
though it is January. 

The Year One. There used to 
be some childish joke about the 
Year One, Don't remember it just 
now. 

Thanksgiving harvest in January. Christmas celebration in 
February. Spring planting in 
July! To say nothing of the inconvenience this -has caused in 
my bookkeeping department! I 
suppose the man will now try to 
change the weather to suit his 
new calendar! 

January 8, 1 
New San Francisco 
He can't last! He can't! A dictator is one thing. A monarch is 
another. But Kyle is something 
else! 

Naturally he had to remove 
certain persons from his way. And 
his summer palace in the plains 
region of America — that's all 
right, that's all right! An authority of Kyle's stature is expected to remove undesirables, 
and to have a summer palace, 
and a winter palace, and anything else he wants! Of course! 

But why this? Why this of all 
things! 

No newspapers! Just like that! 
He waves an edict, and just like 
that, no newspapers.' The Beacon


Sentinel has been a great paper 
for the last twenty-five years! It 
was nothing, and I was nothing, 
and together we became a Voice! 
And now again, we are nothing! 

Oh, I see what's behind it! It's 
revenge, that's what it is! Because he once couldn't become a 
"noospaper" man, he's taking his 
vengeance this way. 

A man as petty as that shall 
be overthrown! Mark my words! 
And the clumsiness of it! 

I see what he is! I know him! 
He's still that pup of seventeen, 
playing king with the world, 
twisting his hands in glee over his 
childish triumph. 

No subtlety ! Just a direct 
pushing over an applecart he 
couldn't steer ! Doesn't matter 
whose apples you destroy, does 
it, Jonesy? Just push it over — 
push it over! 

January 16, 1 
New San Francisco 
Closed the Beacon-Sentinel 
yesterday. My savings are enough 
to take care of me for a few 
years. After that — ah, well, I am 
no longer a young man. I am 
glad that Elsa is not here to see 
this. 

February 12, 1 
New San Francisco 

RECEIVED a letter this morning, requesting me to appear 
at the chambers of His Most 



112 




 



Imperial Majesty, Kyle the First, 
on Tuesday of next week. His 
Most Imperial Majesty can see 
me between 10:15 and 10:25 on 
that morning. 

Ten minutes — rather a brief 
spell in which to roll another 
head. 

I find myself amazed, though. 
Is this man so truly powerful 
that he needs no police to make 
his arrests for him? Can he really 
send messages via jetmail and be 
certain his enemies will not try 
to escape? 

I don't want to attempt flight 
Life without my work is no longer 
life. 

February 17, 1 

Kyleton Palace, North America 
T DON'T understand. I've gone 
over it twice, and I don't 
understand. If only Elsa were 
still with me! I could talk to her. 
She would help me decipher what 
it's all about. 

This morning, at 10:15 sharp, 
I was taken to the public audience chamber in the palace. 

His Majesty was seated behind a desk facing the doors. Behind him, on the wall, was His 
Coat of Arms. 

He stood up and walked toward me, waving away the 
guards. "How are you, Mr. 
Booth?" he said. And offered me 
His Hand! 

I recovered my presence of 



mind, of course, and replied as 
was fitting. 

And then He said it! "I shall 
be at liberty later this week to 
discuss more fully the details of 
these past years." (Shades of 
"ain't got no!") "Meanwhile, my 
secretary will give you a complete dossier on my planned Official Bulletin." He lighted a cigarette after offering me one. "I 
should deem it an honor," he continued, "to have a man of your 
literary versatility and — I must 
add — your vast practical experience become Chief Editor of that 
Bulletin. The publication, which 
I should enjoy christening The 
Terran Beacon-Sentinel — with 
your permission, sir — shall be 
more than my official organ. It 
shall set the standards for the 
coming newspaper world." 

He cocked an eyebrow at me 
and smiled. "I believe we are in 
perfect accord about certain 
standards, are we not, Mr. 
Booth? The deplorable grammatical practices of some newspapers! Well, really, Mr. Booth! I 
feel assured of your agreement!" 

He led me around the desk and 
pointed to the Coat of Arms. As 
He stood silent, I felt obliged to 
look more closely. I had seen it 
before, of course, but seeing it 
now, greatly enlarged, I was able 
to make out its detail. 

What I had thought was a mere 
decorative border, I now realized 



WITH A VENGEANCE 



113 



was a motif I have seen all my 
life! A tiny lighthouse sending 
forth a beam! The trademark of 
my paper! 

As I stood there, gaping, His 
Majesty laughed softly and said, 
"That, Mr. Booth, I felt impelled 
to include. For, without your 
most fortuitous termination of 
my apprenticeship in your organization, I should not have 
risen to my present position." 

A GAIN He took my hand and 
shook it, warmly. His hair is 
just a bit gray at the temples, and 
there are signs of strain on His 
finely featured face. Those awkward hands are now strong and 
purposeful. 

He apologized that He must return to His duties, and went with 
me to the door. "My secretary will 
fill in further details about your 
new position. Newspapers shall 
once again be published. No — 
don't say a word, Mr. Booth! I 
know what you are thinking. 

"Your salary," he continued as 
we stood at the open door, "shall, 
of course, be commensurate to 
your high authority in this new 
field. Allow me, now, to thank 
you most deeply and sincerely 
for your unwitting aid in my 
youth. I assure you, Mr. Booth, 
I have often thought of that day 
we talked. And I hope to repay 
you, in some measure, for what 
you did." 



He said more, mostly polite 
phrases of good-by. And then I 
was outside after being handed a 
folder by some man. 

An official jetmobile took me 
to my residence — which turned 
out to be in the East Wing. Here 
I am, and I don't understand. I 
came prepared to suffer heaven 
only knows what as part of Kilmer Jones's childish pattern for 
revenge. 

Instead, here I am, head of the 
Official Bulletin, titular ruler and 
ruler-in-fact of the future journalism of the world! 

There is something behind this 
— I keep feeling there is. But 
what? What? Or is he truly generous, to a degree never before 
known among absolute monarchs? 

February 13, 1 
Kyleton Palace, North America 
T AM a suspicious and most 
humble old man. I see now 
that Kyle's generosity amazed 
me only because I myself would 
have been incapable of such an 
action. 

Just now, I fear for His Majesty. I was right, before, when 
I said there was no subtlety in 
the man. He is too open, too fair, 
too forgiving. A ruler with such 
greatness of heart might easily 
allow some small insignificant 
person in too far, too close. I fear 
for him! 



114 




 



February 14, 1 
Kyleton Palace, North America 
Tomorrow we begin publication! The pressroom is magnificent! I can hardly wait. It's been 
a long time since I've felt such 
exuberance. 

This afternoon I am to conduct a conference of some eight 
hundred editors! His Majesty's 
secretary has sent me an outline 
on Journalistic Standards, which 
I shall study after lunch. 

There was a. note attached, in 
His Majesty's handwriting — such 
beautiful penmanship, too, "A 
mere formality," it said, "for, of 
course, you and I know full well 
what the future of journalism 
shall be, Mr. Booth." 

Later — 

How wrong can one man be 
in one lifetime? 

I wonder now why he changed 
the calendar. I wonder now what 
poor devil he destroyed then. But 
/'// cheat him! 

I'll cheat him yet!

GALAXY'S 



5 Star Shelf 



YEAR'S BEST SCIENCE FICTION NOVELS, 1953, edited by 
Everett F. Bleiler and T. E. Dikty, Frederick Fell, Inc., New 
York, 1953. 315 pages, $3.50 

rpHIS second annual collection 
of science fiction novelets 
contains one from Astounding. 
one from Thrilling Wonder, and 
three from GALAXY. Naturally, 
we do feel good about the compliment. 



Astoundings contribution is 
William Tenn's alien invasion 
tale called "Firewater." It's about 
"dots in bottles" from outer space 
that drive brainy men crazy and 
are themselves driven nuts by 
men. 

Thrilling Wonder gives us 
Murray Leinster's cute and weird 
science fantasy "The Gadget Had 
a Ghost," about some characters 
in Istanbul who find an icy spot 
in a wall where no such spot

should be, and discover that 
small objects can be passed 
through it to the Thirteenth 
Century. 

The three GALAXY items are: 
Boyd Ellanby's "Category Phoenix," about the immortality conferred by the Blue Martian 
Fever and what happens because 
of it in a dictatorially ruled America; James Blish's "Surface Tension," describing the adventures 
of microscopic men on a far 
planet where they had been deposited by full-sized humans ; 
and Walter Miller's "Conditionally Human," on the heartbreaking difficulties of a poundkeeper 
for mutated chimps that are used 
as substitute children in a genetically controlled world of tomorrow. 

Bleiler and Dikty are to be 
complimented on their second 
annual novelet collection ; it is 
an excellent job. 

ORIGIN OF LIFE by A. f. 
Oparin. Translated by Sergius 
Morgulis. Dover Publications, 
New York, 1953. 270 pa^es, $1.70, 
paper 

ON May 17, 1953, The New 
York Times published a long 
editorial on an experiment by 
Stanley L. Miller, a student of 
Professor Harold Urey at the 
University of Chicago. In this experiment, Miller is said to have 



created some of the amino acids 
that are the building blocks of 
life, and to have done so in an 
"atmosphere" similar to that existing on Earth a billion and a 
half years ago. 

In achieving this, Miller at 
least partially has proved, by 
laboratory experiment, the worldshaking gecbiological theories put 
forward in Oparin's book here 
under review. Both Miller and 
The Times credit Oparin with 
the speculations on which the experiment was based. 

On any count, then, Oparin's 
book — which was first published 
in this country in 1938 by the 
Macmillan Company — is of great 
public interest in view of new 
developments. But more than 
that, it is inherently valuable because of the lucid approach 
Oparin has taken to his subject, 
an approach brilliantly reflected 
by Dr. Morgulis* smooth and 
easy -flowing translation. 

First, Oparin disposes of all 
previous theories of the origin of 
life, from spontaneous generation 
to the theory of the interstellar 
travel of life spores made popular by Arrhenius. He then goes 
on to show how organic matter 
must have come into existence 
before life itself, not after, and 
proves in passing that much of 
our store of petroleum hydrocarbons was probably created in the 
very beginnings of our planet, 



T IS 

I 




 



and is not the result of the decay of plant life, as we have all 
been taught. He also describes 
some fascinating new theories on 
the formation of the complex 
protein molecules from which 
living things that resulted in Man 
were developed. 

The book is moderately easy 
to grasp, even to people with only 
a high-school knowledge of chemistry. And it is epoch-making, no 
question of it. Make it one of 
your more serious "musts." 

ICEWORLD by Hal Clement 
Gnome Press, New York, 1953. 
216 pages, $2.50 

T70R m y money, Hal Clement 
has the ability to make the 
utterly alien seem utterly real 
better than any other science i 
fiction writer now in operating 
condition. It is this magnificent 
ability to visualize that raises 
this tale above the average in 
science fiction. 

The story (serialized in Astounding) tells of a small group 
of people, from a very hot world 
with a sulphur atmosphere, who 
are aboard an interstellar trading vessel. One of the crew is a 
detective trying to track down 
the source of a hideous habitforming drug that has been making inroads on his people. 

The ship lands on Mercury (a 
"cold" planet to them) and trad


ing contact is made with Iceworld, or Earth. Eventually the 
drug is found to be a common 
Earthian herb, theretofore innocently supplied by an Earthian 
named Wing, who received in return for small quantities of it 
many pounds of rare and precious 
metals. 

Clement is a master of "imaginative realism." He refuses to 
mystify, or overawe, or hypnotize his readers with supersedence, fantastic impossibilities and 
garish language. He makes his altogether unhistoric events seem 
real by talking about them in a 
completely matter-of-fact "tone 
of pen." Unfortunately, his aliens are more human than his 
human characters, which makes 
me wish he would deal with aliens only. Nevertheless, this is believable, exciting, and satisfying 
fiction. 

RING AROUND THE SUN by 
Clifford D, Simak. Simon & 
Schuster, Inc., New York, 1953. 
242 pages, $2.75 

HERE, on the other hand, is a 
straight science fantasy — and 
a genuinely lovely book, too. It 
is one of those bitter-sweet, 
tough-gentle, purely magic fairy 
tales of supernormal powers, parallel worlds, enormously advanced civilizations — and children's 
playthings — that take you com

pletely out of yourself. 

People who read it first in 
GALAXY as a serial won't need 
to be told about its plot. Others 
will have to be tantalized with 
the following clues: It deals with 
the daydream of a Better World 
Next Door; the powers of paranormal magics like the mesmerizing spin of a child's top; a 
supersedence that can produce indestructible modern conveniences 
practically free of charge; and 
the inspiring struggle between the 
humdrum dirtiness of Earthly industrialism and the enchantment 
of far-advanced science in the 
"better" parallel world. 

It, too, in a different way, is 
believable, exciting and satisfying, with some of the most ingenious plot twists in recent science 
fiction. 

EX-PRODIGY by Norbert Wiener. Simon *& Schuster, Inc., New 
York, 1953. 310 pages, $3.95 

TT is not my intention to re■■- view this fascinating book by 
the man best known for his work 
on Cybernetics — the very name 
of which he invented — with anything like the completeness it 
calls for. 

I only want to call your attention to the fact that the book is, 
in a sense, the autobiography of 
a homo superior, a man with 
definitely supernormal mental 



powers. This alone should make 
it exciting for most adult science 
fiction readers. But furthermore 
it is an enthralling human document as well, a picture of "growing Up" that can compete with 
most of the famous narratives of 
childhood I am familiar with. 

My only disappointment in the 
book is that it does not discuss 
any of the genetic aspects of the 
supernormal. All Dr. Wiener does 
is to make it clear that he disagrees with his father's theory 
that a prodigy is entirely the result of special educational practices; he omits entirely any 
discission of what circumstances 
caus« or create prodigies. 

It seems to me that so intelligent and introspective a man 
might have found it worth his 
while to make a few observations 
along these lines . . . and who 
would be better suited to? 

But the objection is a minor 
one. The book is both revealing 
and warmly human; it deserves 
every reader it gets. 

ONCE UPON A STAR by Kenda// Foster Crossen. Henry Holt 
& Co., Inc., New York, 1953. 237 
pages, $2.95 

rpiJIS is subtitled "A Novel^ of 
the Future,*' but actually consists of four novelets about the 
same characters: an insurance 
investigator named Manning 



120 




 



Draco, his caricature of a Big 
Business Boss called J. Barnaby 
Cruikshank, two practical- joking 
insurance -salesmen- villains 
named Sam Warren and Dzanku 
Dzanku, the latter being a native of Rigel IV, and assorted 
Milky Way females. 

The adventures take place on 
various planets and involve genuine and counterfeit insurance 
claims arising from interstellar 
trade and travel. 

THE UNDYING FIRE by Fletcher Pratt, Ballantine Books, 
Inc., New York, 1953. Cloth 
$1.50, paper 35c ' 

T AM sorry to have to report 
that this third ' item in the 
Ballantine Books' science fiction 
list falls far behind the quality 
of the first two. Star Science Fiction and Space Merchants, and 
also that it is far below the best 
that Fletcher Pratt can do. Tenuous is the word for it. 

It deals with a spaceship going 
on a complicated trip to the lightyears-distant planet of Danaan to 
steal a neptunium motor. The 
astropolitics encountered are involved and the various love motifs energetic, but neither do 
much to rescue the book from its 
basic weakness — lack of inventiveness. 

Here's hoping that both Bal


lantine's and Pratt*s next will be 
more nourishing than this one. 

THE TRANSCENDENT MAN 
by Jerry Sohl. Rinehart & Co., 
New York, 1953. 244 pages, $2.50 

WITH books like this, the era 
of rental library science fiction can be said to have dawned. 
Facile, mechanically adequate, 
uninspired, often reminiscent of 
other peoples' ideas (the present 
book would not be what it was, 
I think, were it not for Eric Frank 
Russell's immeasurably superior 
Sinister Barrier), and curiously 
empty and wooden, like a story 
written with the aid of a Plotto 
and an IBC computer, it holds 
the attention, but rewards it with 
nothing of interest. 

Briefly, the book tells how aliens from Capella, breeding on the 
"thought force" released by humans killed in wars, plagues and 
other Earthly catastrophes, control our society. 

Magazine writer Martin Enders finds out all about this while 
trying to interview a scientist in 
charge of a top-secret military 
project. He escapes with his life, 
the girl, and the job of playing 
God to mankind, given him by 
the departing Capellans. 

Unconvincing, but it moves 
fast.

By H. 1. GOLD 

How does a person come to be scratched from 
the human race? Psychiatry did not have the 
answer — perhaps docker's tvrf science did! 



Illustrated by VIDMER 



r HEN Clocker Locke 
came into the Blue 
Ribbon, on 49th Street 
west of Broadway, he saw that 
nobody had told Doc Hawkins 
about his misfortune. Doc, a pubcrawling, non-practicing general 
practitioner who wrote a daily 
medical column for a local tabloid, was celebrating his release 
from the alcoholic ward, but his 




 



guests at the rear table of the 
restaurant weren't in any mood 
for celebration. 

"What's the matter with you — 
have you suddenly become immune to liquor?" Cldcker heard 
Doc ask irritably, while Clocker 
was passing the gem merchants, 
who, because they needed natural daylight to do business, were 
traditionally accorded the tables 
nearest the windows. "I said the 
drinks were on me, didn't I?" 
Doc insisted. "Now let us have 
some bright laughter and sparkling wit, or must we wait until 
Clocker shows up before there is 
levity in the house?" 

Seeing the others glance toward 
the door, Doc turned and looked 
at Clocker. His mouth fell open 
silently, for the first time in 
docker's memory. 

"Good Lord!" he said after a 
moment. "Clocker's become a 
character!" 

Clocker felt embarrassed. He 
still wasn't used to wearing a 
business suit of subdued gray, 
and black oxfords, instead of his 
usual brilliant sports jacket, 
slacks and two-tone suede shoes; 
a tie with timid little figures, 
whereas he had formerly been an 
authority on hand-painted cravats; and a plain wristwatch in 
place of his spectacular chronograph. 

By all Broadway standards, 
he knew, Doc was correct — he'd 



become strange and eccentric, a 
character. 

"TT was Zelda's idea," Clocker 
explained somberly, sitting 
down and shaking his head at the 
waiter who ambled over. "She 
wanted to make a gentleman out 
of me." 

"Wanted to?" Doc repeated, 
bewildered. "You two kids got 
married just before they took my 
snakes away. Don't tell me you 
phhtt already!" 

Clocker looked appealingly at 
the others. They became busy 
with drinks and paper napkins. 

Naturally, Doc Hawkins knew 
the background : That Clocker 
was a race handicapper — publisher, if you could call it that, 
of a tiny tip sheet — for Doc, in 
need of drinking money, had 
often consulted him professionally. Also that Clocker had married Zelda, the noted 52nd Street 
stripteuse, who had social aspirations. What remained to be 
told had occurred during Doc's 
inevitably temporary cure. 

"Isn't anybody going to tell 
me?" Doc demanded. 

"It was right after you tried 
to take the warts off a fire hydrant and they came and got 
you," said Clocker, "that Zelda 
started hearing voices. It got real 
bad." 

"How bad?" 

"She's at Glendale Center in 



124 




 



an upholstered room. I just came 
back from visiting her." 

Doc gulped his entire drink, a 
positive sign that he was upset, 
or happy, or not feeling anything 
in particular. Now, however, he 
was noticeably upset. 

"Did the psychiatrists give you 
a diagnosis?" he ask'id. 

"I got it memorized. Catatonia. 
Dementia praecox, what they 
used to call, one of the brain vets 
told me, and he said it's hopeless." 

"Rough" said Doc. "Very 
rough. The outlook is never good 
in such cases." 

"Maybe they can't help her," 
Clocker said harshly, "but I 
will." 

"People are not horses," Doc 
reminded him. 

"I've noticed that," said Handy Sam, the armless wonder at 
the flea circus, drinking beer because he had an ingrown toenail 
and couldn't hold a shot glass. 
Now that Clocker had told the 
grim story, he felt free to talk, 
which he did enthusiastically. 
"Clocker's got a giant brain, Doc. 
Who was it said Warlock'd turn 
into a dog in his third year? 
Clocker, the only dopester in the 
-racket. And that's just one — " 

"Zelda was my best flesh act," 
interrupted Arnold Wilson Wyle, 
a ten-percenter whom video had 
saved from alimony jail. "A solid 
boffola in the bop basements. 



Nobody regrets her sad condition more than me, Clocker, but 
it's a sure flop, what you got in , 
mind. Think of your public. For 
instance, what's good at Hialeah? 
My bar bill is about to be foreclosed and I can use a long shot." 

Clocker bounced his fist on the 
moist table. "Those couch artists 
don't know what's wrong with 
Zelda. I do." 

"You do?" Doc asked, startled. 

"Well, almost. I'm so close, I 
can hear the finish-line camera 
clicking." 

Buttonhole grasped Doc's lapel 
and hung on with characteristic 
avidity; he was perhaps Clocker's most pious subscriber. "Doping races is a science. Clocker 
maybe never doped the human 
race, but I got nine to five he 
can do it. Go on, tell him, 
Clocker." 

DOC Hawkins ran together the 
rings he had been making 
with the wet bottom of his tumbler. "I shall be most interested," 
he said with tabloid irony, clearly 
feeling that immediate disillusionment was the most humane 
thing for Clocker. "Perhaps we 
can collaborate on an article for 
the psychiatric journals." 

"All right, look." Clocker pulled out charts resembling those he 
worked with when making turf 
selections. "Zelda's got catatonia, 
which is the last heat in the

schizophrenia parlay. She used 
to be a hoofer before she started 
undressing for dough, and now 
she does time-steps all day." 

Doc nodded into a fresh glass 
that the waiter had put before 
him. "Stereotyped movements are 
typical of catatonia. They derive 
from thwarted or repressed instinctual drive; in most instances, 
the residue of childhood frustrations." 

"She dance all day, huh, 
Clocker?" asked Oil Pocket, the 
Oklahoma Cherokee who, with 
the income of several wells, was 
famed for angeling bareback 
shows. He had a glass of tequila 
in one hand, the salted half of a 
lemon in the other. "She dance 
good?" 

"That's just it," Clocker said. 
"She does these time-steps, the 
first thing you learn in hoofing, 
over and over, ten-fifteen hours a 
day. And she keeps talking like 
she's giving lessons to some jerk 
kid who can't get it straight. And 
she was the kid with the hot routines, remember." 

"The hottest," agreed Arnold 
Wilson Wyle. "Zelda doing timesteps is like Heifetz fiddling at 
weddings." 

■ "I still like to put her in 
show," Oil Pocket grunted. "She 
stacked like brick tepee. Don't 
have to dance good." 

"You'll have a long wait," observed Doc sympathetically, "in 



spite of what our young friend 
here says. Continue, young 
friend." 

Clocker spread his charts. He 
needed the whole table. The 
others removed their drinks, Handy Sam putting his on the floor 
so he could reach it more easily. 

"This is ( "mat I got out of 
checking all the screwball factories I could reach personal and 
by mail," Clocker said. "I went 
around and talked to the doctors 
and watched the patients in the 
places near here, and wrote to the 
places I couldn't get to. Then I 
broke everything down like it was 
a stud and track record." 

Buttonhole tugged Doc's lapel. 
"That ain't scientific, I suppose," 
he challenged. 

"Duplication of effort," Doc replied, patiently allowing Buttonhole to retain his grip. "It was 
all done in an organized fashion 
over a period of more than half 
a century. But let us hear the 
rest." 

"FMRST," said Clocker, "there 
are more male bats than 
fillies." 

"Females are inherently more 
stable, perhaps because they have 
a more balanced chromosome arrangement." • 

"There are more nuts in the 
brain rackets than labor chumps." 

"Intellectual activity increases 
the area of conflict."

"There are less in the sticks 
than in the cities, and practically 
none among the savages. I mean 
real savages," Clocker told Handy Sam, "not marks for con merchants." 

"I was wondering," Handy 
Sam admitted. 

"Complex civilization creates 
psychic insecurity," said Doc. 

"When these catatonics pull 
out, they don't remember much 
or maybe nothing," Clocker 
went on, referring to his charts. 

Doc nodded his shaggy white 
head. "Protective amnesia." 

"I seen hundreds of these mental gimps. They work harder and 
longer at what they're doing, even 
just laying down and doing nothing, than they ever did when 
they were regular citizens." 

"Concentration of psychic energy, of course." 

"And they don't get a damn 
cent for it." 

"p\OC hesitated, put down his 
half-filled tumbler. "I beg 
your pardon?" 

"I say they're getting stiffed," 
Clocker stated. "Anybody who 
works that hard ought to get 
paid. I don't mean it's got to be 
money, although that's the only 
kind of pay Zelda'd work for. 
Right, Arnold?" 

"Well, sure," said Arnold Wilson Wyle wonderingly. "I never 
thought of it like that. Zelda do


ing time-steps for nothing tenfifteen hours a day— that ain't 
Zelda." 

"If you ask me, she likes her 
job," Clocker said. "Same with 
the other catatonics I seen. But 
for no pay?" 

Doc surprisingly pushed his 
drink away, something that only 
a serious medical puzzle could 
ever accomplish. "I don't understand what you're getting at." 

"I don't know these other catacharacters, but I do know Zelda," 
said Arnold Wilson Wyle. "She's 
got to get something out of all 
that work. Clocker says it's the 
same with the others and I take 
his word. What are they knocking theirself out for if it's for 
free?" 

"They gain some obscure form 
of emotional release or repetitive 
gratification," Doc explained. 

"Zelda?" exploded Clocker. 
"You offer her a deal like that 
for a club date and she'd get ruptured laughing." 

"I tell her top billing," Oil 
Pocket agreed, "plenty ads, plenty publicity, whole show built 
around her. Wampum, she says; 
save money on ads and publicity, 
give it to her. Zelda don't count 
coups." 

Doc Hawkins called over the 
waiter, ordered five fingers instead of his customary three. "Let 
us not bicker," he told Clocker. 
"Continue."

C LOCKER looked at his charts 
again. "There ain't a line 
that ain't represented, even the 
heavy rackets and short grifts. 
It's a regular human steeplechase. 
And these sour apples do mostly 
whatever they did for a living — 
draw pictures, sell shoes, do lab 
experiments, sew clothes, Zelda 
with her time-steps. By the hour! 
In the airr" 

"In the air?" Handy Sam repeated. "Flying?" 

"Imaginary functioning," Doc 
elaborated for him. "They have 
nothing in their hands. Pure hallucination. Systematic delusion." 

"Sign language?" Oil Pocket 
suggested. 

"That," said Clocker, before 
Doc Hawkins could reject the 
notion, "is on the schnoz, Injun. 
Buttonhole says I'm like doping 
races. He's right. I'm working 
out what some numbers-runner 
tells me is probabilities. I got it 
all here," he rapped the charts, 
"and it's the same thing all these 
flop-ears got in common. Not 
their age, ndt their jobs, not their 
— you should pardon the expression — sex. They're teaching." 

Buttonhole looked baffled. He 
almost let go of Doc's lapel. 

Handy Sam scratched the back 
of his neck thoughtfully with a 
big toe. "Teaching, Clocker? 
Who? You said they're kept in 
solitary." 

"They are. I don't know who. 



I'm working on that now." 

Doc shoved the charts aside 
belligerently to make room for 
his beefy elbows. He leaned forward and glowered at Clocker. 
"Your theory belongs in the Sunday supplement of the alleged 
newspaper I write for. Not all 
catatonics work, as you call it. 
What about those who stand 
rigid and those who lie in bed 
all the time?" 

"I guess you think that's easy," 
Clocker retorted. "You try it 
sometime. I did. It's work, I tell 
you." He folded his charts and 
put them back into the inside 
pocket of his conservative jacket. 
He looked sick with longing and 
loneliness. "Damn, I miss that 
mouse. I got to save her, Doc! 
Don't you get that?" 

Doc Hawkins put a chunky 
hand gently on Clocker's arm. 
"Of course, boy. But how can 
you succeed when trained men 
can't?" 

"Well, take Zelda. She did 
time-steps when she was maybe 
five and going to dancing 
school — " 

"Time-steps have some symbolic significance to her," Doc 
said with more than his usual 
tact. "My theory is that she was 
compelled to go against-her will, 
and this is a form of unconscious 
rebellion." 

' "They don't have no significance to her," Clocker argued

doggedly. "She can do time-steps 
blindfolded and on her knees 
with both ankles tied behind her 
back." He pried Buttonhole's 
hand off Doc's lapel, and took 
hold of both of them himself. 
"I tell you she's teaching, explaining, breaking in some dummy who can't get the hang of 
it!" 

"But who?" Doc objected. 
"Psychiatrists? Nurses? You? 
Admit it, Clocker— she goes on 
doing time-steps whether she's 
alone or not. In fact, she never 
knows if anybody is with her. 
Isn't that so?" 

"Yeah," Clocker said grudgingly. "That's what has me 
boxed." 

i"\IL Pocket grunted tentative" ly. "White men not believe 
in spirits. Injuns do. Maybe 
Zelda talk to spirits." 

"I been thinking of that," confessed Clocker, looking at the red 
angel Unhappily. "Spirits is all 
I can figure. Ghosts. Spooks. But 
if Zelda and these other catatonics are teaching ghosts, these 
ghosts are the dumbest jerks anywhere. They make her and the 
rest go through time-steps or sewing or selling shoes again and 
again. If they had half a brain, 
they'd get it in no time." 

"Maybe spirits not hear good," 
Oil Pocket offered, encouraged 
by Clocker's willingness to con


sider the hypothesis. 

"Could be," Clocker said with 
partial conviction. "If we can't 
see them, it may be just as hard 
for them to see or hear us." 

Oil Pocket anxiously hitched 
his chair closer. "Old squaw name 
Dry Ground Never Rainy Season — what you call old maid — 
hear spirits all the time. She keep 
telling us what they say. Nobody 
listen." 

"How come?" asked Clocker 
interestedly. 

"She deaf, blind. Not hear 
thunder. Walk into cactus, yell 
like hell. She hardly see us, not 
hear us at all, how come she see 
and hear spirits? Just talk, talk, 
talk all the time." 

Clocker frowned, thinking. 
"These catatonics don't see or 
hear us, but they sure as Citation hear and see something.*' 

Doc Hawkins stood up with 
dignity, hardly weaving, and 
handed a bill to the waiter. "I 
was hoping to get a private racing tip from you, Clocker. Freshly sprung from the alcoholic 
ward, I can use some money. 
But I see that your objectivity is 
impaired by emotional considerations. I wouldn't risk a dime on 
your advice even after a race is 
run." 

"I didn't expect you to believe 
me," said Clocker despairingly. 
"None of you pill-pushers ever 
do."

"I can't say about your psycho-doping," declared Arnold 
Wilson Wyle, also rising. "But I 
got faith in your handicapping. 
I'd still like a long shot at Hialeah if you happen to have one." 

"I been too busy trying to help 
Zelda," Clocker said in apology. 

They left, Doc Hawkins pausing at the bar to pick up a credit 
bottle to see him through his 
overdue medical column. 
■ r Handy Sam slipped on his 
shoes to go. "Stick with it, 
Clocker. I said you was a scientist—" 

"I said it," contradicted Buttonhole, lifting himself out of the 
chair on Handy Sam's lapels. "If 
anybody can lick this caper, 
Clocker can." 

Oil Pocket glumly watched 
them leave. "Doctors not think 
spirits real," he said. "I get sick, 
go to Reservation doctor. He give 
me medicine. I get sicker. Medicine man see evil spirits make 
me sick. Shakes rattle. Dances. 
Evil spirits go. I get better." 
. "I don't know what in hell to 
think," confided Clocker, misererable and confused. "If it would 
help Zelda, I'd cut my throat 
from head to foot so I could become a spirit and get the others 
to lay off her." 

"Then you spirit, she alive. 
Making love not very practical." 

"Then what do I do — hire a 
medium?" 



"Get medicine man from Reservation. He drive out evil spirits." 

Clocker pushed away from the 
table. "So help me, I'll do it if 
I can't come up with something 
cheaper than paying freight from 
Oklahoma." 

"Get Zelda out, I pay and put 
her in show." 

"Then if I haul the guy here 
and it don't work, I'm in hock 
to you. Thanks, Oil Pocket, but 
I'll try my way first." 

T> ACK in his hotel room, waiting for the next day so he 
could visit Zelda, Clocker was 
like an addict at the track with 
every cent on a hunch. After 
weeks of neglecting his tip sheet 
to study catatonia, he felt close 
to the payoff. 

He spent most of the night 
smoking and walking around the 
room, trying not to look at the 
jars and hairbrushes on the bureau. He missed the bobbypins 
on the floor, the nylons drying 
across the shower rack, the toothpaste tubes squeezed from the 
top. He'd put her perfumes in a 
drawer, but the smell was so pervasively haunting that it was like 
having her stand invisibly behind 
him. 

As soon as the sun came up, 
he hurried out and took a cab. 
He'd have to wait until visiting 
hours, but he couldn't stand the

slowness of the train. Just being 
in the same building with her 
would — almost — be enough. 

When he finally was allowed 
into Zelda's room, he spent all 
his time watching her silently, 
taking in every intently mumbled 
word and movement. Her movements, in spite of their gratingly 
basic monotony, were particularly something to watch, for Zelda 
had blue-black hair down to her 
shapely shoulders, wide -apart 
blue eyes, sulky mouth, and an 
astonishing body. She used all 
her physical equipment with unconscious provocativeness, except 
her eyes, which were blankly distant. 

Clocker stood it as long as he 
could and then burst out, "Damn 
it, Zelda, how long can they take 
to learn a time-step?" 

She didn't answer. She didn't 
see him, hear him, or feel him. 
Even when he kissed her on the 
back of the neck, her special 
place, she did not twist her shoulder up with the sudden thrill. 

He took out the portable phonograph he'd had permission to 
bring in, and hopefully played 
three of her old numbers — a ballet tap, a soft shoe, and, most potent of all, her favorite slinky 
strip tune. Ordinarily, the beat 
would have thrown her off, but 
not any more. 

*'Dead to this world," muttered Clocker dejectedly. 



He shook Zelda. Even when 
she was off-balance, her feet tapped out the elementary routine. 

"Look, kid," he said, his voice 
tense and angry, "I don't know 
who these squares are that you're 
working for, but tell them if they 
got you, they got to take me, 
too." 

Whatever he expected — ghostly figures to materialize or a chill 
wind from nowhere — nothing 
happened. She went on tapping. 

He sat down on her bed. They 
picked people the way he picked 
horses, except he picked to win 
and they picked to show. To 
show? Of course. Zelda was showing them how to dance and also, 
probably, teaching them about 
the entertainment business. The 
others had obviously been selected for what they knew, which 
they went about doing as singlemindedly as she did. 

HE had a scheme that he hadn't 
told Doc because he knew it 
was crazy. At any rate, he hoped 
it was. The weeks without her 
had been a hell of loneliness — 
for him, not for her; she wasn't 
even aware of the awful loss. 
He'd settle for that, but even better would be freeing her somehow. The only way he could*do 
it would be to find out who controlled her and what they were 
after. Even with that information, 
he couldn't be sure of succeed

ing, and there was a good chance 
thot he might also be caught, but 
that didn't matter. 

The idea was to interest them 
in what he knew so they would 
want to have him explain all he 
knew about racing. After that — 
well, he'd make his plans when 
he knew the setup. 

Clocker came close to the automatic time-step machine that 
had been his wife. He began talking to her, very loudly, about the 
detailed knowledge needed to select winners, based on stud records, past performances of 
mounts and jockeys, condition of 
track and the influence of the 
weather — always, however, leaving out the data that would make 
sense of the whole complicated 
industry. It was like roping a 
patsy and holding back the buzzer until the dough was down. 
He knew he risked being colddecked , but it was worth the 
gamble. His only worry was that 
hoarseness would stop him before he hooked their interest. 

An orderly, passing in the corridor, heard his voice, opened 
the door and asked with ponderous humor, "What you doing, 
Clocker — trying to take out a 
membership card in this country club?" 

Clocker leaped slightly. "Uh, 
working on a private theory," he 
said, collected his things with a 
little more haste than he would 



have liked to show, kissed Zelda 
without getting any response 
whatever, and left for the day. 

But he kept coming back every 
morning. He was about to give 
up when the first feelings of unreality dazed and dazzled him. 
He carefully suppressed his excitement and talked more loudly 
about racing. The world seemed 
to be slipping away from him. 
He could have hung onto it if 
he had wanted. He didn't. He 
let the voices come, vague and 
far away, distorted, not quite 
meaningless, but not adding up 
to much, either. 

And then, one day, he didn't 
notice the orderly come in to 
teH him that visiting hours were 
over. Clocker was explaining the 
fundamentals of horse racing . . . 
meticulously, with immense patience, over and over and over 
. . . and didn't hear him. 

TT had been so easy that Clocker was disappointed. The first 
voices had argued gently and 
reasonably over him, each claiming priority for one reason or another, until one either was 
assigned or pulled rank. That 
was the voice that Clocker eventually kept hearing — a quiet, 
calm voice that constantly faded 
and grew stronger, as if it came 
from a great distance and had 
trouble with static. Clocker remembered the crystal set his fath

er had bought when radio was 
still a toy. It was like that. 

Then the unreality vanished 
and was replaced by a dramatic 
new reality. He was somewhere 
far away. He knew -it wasn't on 
Earth, for this was like nothing 
except, perhaps, a World's Fair. 
The buildings were low and attractively designed, impressive in 
spite of their softly blended spectrum of pastel colors. He was in 
a huge square that was grasscovered and tree-shaded and decorated with classical sculpture. 
Hundreds of people stood with 
him, and they all looked shaken 
and scared. Clocker felt nothing 
but elation; he'd arrived. It made 
no difference that he didn't know 
where he was or anything about 
the setup. He was where Zelda 
was. 

"How did I get here?" asked 
a little man with bifocals and a 
vest that had pins and threaded 
needles stuck in it. "I can't take 
time for pleasure trips. Mrs. 
Jacobs is coming in for her fitting tomorrow and she'll positively murder me if her dress 
ain't ready." 

"She can't," Clocker said. "Not 
any more." 

"You mean we're dead?" 
someone else asked, awed. It was 
a softly pudgy woman with excessively blonde hair, a greasily 
red- lipped smile and a flowered 
housecoat. She looked around 



with great approval. "Hey, this 
ain't bad! Like I always said, 
either I'm no worse than anybody else or they're no better'n 
me. How about that, dearie?" 

"Don't ask me," Clocker 
evaded. "I think somebody's going to get an earful, but you ain't 
dead. That much I can tell you." 

The woman looked disappointed. 

Some people in the crowd were 
complaining that they had families to take care of while others 
were worried about leaving their 
businesses. They all grew silent, 
however, when a man climbed up 
on a sort of marble rostrum in 
front of them. He was very tall 
and dignified and wore formal 
clothes and had a white beard 
parted in the center. 

"Please feel at ease," he said 
in a big, deep, soothing voice, 
like a radio announcer for a symphony broadcast. "You are not 
in any danger. No harm will 
come to you." 

"You sure we ain't dead, 
sweetie?" the woman in the flowered housecoat asked Clocker. 
"Isn't, that— " 

"No," said Clocker. "He'd have 
a halo, wouldn't he?" 

"Yeah, I guess so," she agreed 
doubtfully. 

The white-bearded man went 
on, "If you will listen carefully 
to this orientation lecture, you 
will know where you are and 



134 




 



why. May I introduce Gerald W. 
Harding? Dr. Harding is in 
charge of this reception center. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Harding." 

A NUMBER of people applauded out of habit . . . 
probably lecture fans or semipro TV studio audiences. The 
rest, including Clocker, waited as 
an aging man in a white lab 
smock, heavy-rimmed eyeglasses 
and smooth pink cheeks, looking 
like a benevolent doctor in a 
mouthwash ad, stood up and 
faced the crowd. He put his 
hands behind his back, rocked on 
his toes a few times, and smiled 
■benevolently. 

"Thank you, Mr. Calhoun," 
he said to the bearded man who 
was seating himself on a marble 
bench. "Friends — and I trust you 
will soon regard us as your friends 
— I know you are puzzled at all 
this." He waved a white hand 
at the buildings around them. 
"Let me explain. You have been 
chosen — yes, carefully screened 
and selected — to help us in undoubtedly the greatest cause of 
all history. I can see that you 
are asking, yourselves why you 
were selected and what this cause 
is. I shall describe it briefly. 
You'll learn more about it as we 
work together in this vast and 
noble experiment," 

The woman in the flowered 



housecoat looked enormously 
flattered. The little tailor was 
nodding to show he understood 
the points covered thus far. 
Glancing at the rest of the crowd, 
Crocker realized that he was the 
on-ly one who had this speech 
pegged. It was a pitch. These 
men were out for something. 

He wished Doc Hawkins and 
Oil Pocket were there. Doc 
doubtless would have searched 
his unconscious for symbols of 
childhood traumas to explain the 
whole thing; he would never have 
accepted it as some kind of reality. Oil Pocket, on the other 
hand, would somehow have tried 
to equate the substantial Mr. Calhoun and Dr. Harding with tribal 
spirits. Of the two, Clocker felt 
that Oil Pocket would have been 
closer. 

Or maybe he was in his own 
corner of psychosis, while Oil 
Pocket would have been in another, more suited to Indians. 
Spirits or figments? Whatever 
they were, they looked as real as 
anybody he'd ever known, but 
perhaps that was the naturalness 
of the supernatural or the logic 
of insanity. 

Clocker shivered, aware that 
he had to wait for the answer. 
The one thing he did know, as 
an authority on cons, was that 
this had the smell of one, supernatural or otherwise. He watched 
and listened like a detective shad

owing an escape artist. 

"This may be something of a 
shock," Dr. Harding continued 
with a humorous, sympathetic 
smile, "I hope it will not be for 
long. Let me state it in its simplest terms. You know that there 
are billions of stars in the Universe, and that stars have planets 
as naturally as cats have kittens. 
A good many of these planets are 
inhabited. Some life-forms are 
intelligent, very much so, while 
others are not. In almost all instances, the dominant form of life 
is quite different from — yours." 

Unable to see the direction of 
the con, Clocker felt irritated. 

"Why do I say yours, not ours?" 
asked Dr. Harding. "Because, 
dear friends, Mr. Calhoun and I 
are not of your planet or solar 
system. No commotion, please!" 
he urged, raising his hands as the 
crowd stirred bewilderedly. "Our 
names are not Calhoun and 
Harding; we adopted those because our own are so alien that 
you would be unable to pronounce them. We are not formed 
as you see us, but this is how 
we might look if we were human 
beings, which, of course, we are 
not. Our true appearance seems 
to be — ah — rather confusing to 
human eyes." 

NUTS, Clocker thought irreverently. Get to the point. 
"I don't think this is the time 



for detailed explanations," Dr. 
Harding hurried on before there 
were any questions. "We are 
friendly, even altruistic inhabitants of a planet 10,000 lightyears from Earth. Quite a distance, you are thinking; how did 
we get here? The truth is that 
we are not 'here' and neither are 
you. 'Here' is a projection of 
thought, a hypothetical point in 
space, a place that exists only 
by mental force. Our physical 
appearances and yours are telepathic representations. Actually, 
our bodies are on our own respective planets." 

"Very confusing," complained 
a man who looked like a banker. 
"Do you have any idea of what 
he's trying to tell us?" 

"Not yet," Clocker replied with 
patient cynicism. "He'll give us 
the convincer after the buildup." 

The *man who looked like a 
banker stared sharply at Clocker 
and moved away. Clocker shrugged. He was more concerned with 
why he didn't feel tired or bored 
just standing there and listening. 
There was not even an overpowering sense of urgency and annoyance, although he wanted to 
find Zelda and this lecture was 
keeping him from looking for 
her. It was as if his emotions 
were somehow being reduced in 
intensity. They existed, but lacked the strength they should have 
had. 



136 




 



So he stood almost patiently 
and listened to Dr. Harding say, 
"Our civilization is considerably 
older than yours. For many of 
your centuries, we have explored 
the Universe, both physically and 
telepathically. During this exploration, we discovered your 
planet. We tried to establish 
communication, but there were 
grave difficulties. It was the time 
of your Dark Ages, and I'm sorry 
to report that those people we 
made contact with were generally 
burned at the stake." He shook 
his head regretfully. "Although 
your civilization has made many 
advances in some ways, communication is still hampered — as 
much by false knowledge as by 
real ignorance. You'll see in a 
moment why it is very unfortunate." 

"Here it comes," Clocker said 
to those around him. "He's getting ready finally to slip us the 
sting." 

The woman in the housecoat 
looked indignant. "The nerve of 
a crumb like you making a crack 
about such a fine, decent gentleman!" 

"A blind man could see he's 
sincere," argued the tailor. "Just 
think of it — me, in a big experiment! Will Molly be surprised 
when she finds out!" 

"She won't find out and I'll 
bet she's surprised right now," 
Clocker assured him. 



"The human body is an unbelievably complicated organism," 
Dr. Harding was saying. The 
statement halted the private discussion and seemed to please his 
listeners for some reason. "We 
learned that when we tried to assume control of individuals for 
the purpose of communication. 
Billions of neural relays, thousands of unvolitional functions — 
it is no exaggeration to compare 
our efforts with those of a monkey in a power plant. At our direction, for example, several 
writers produced books that were 
fearfully garbled. Our attempts 
with artists were no more successful. The static of interstellar 
space was partly responsible, but 
mostly it was the fact that we 
simply couldn't work our way 
through the maze that is the human mind and body." 

T"!HE crowd was sympathetic. 

Clocker was neither weary nor 
bored, merely longing for Zelda 
and, as a student of grifts, dimly 
irritated. Why hold back when 
the chumps were set up? 

"I don't want to make a long 
story of our problems," smiled 
Dr. Harding. "If we could visit 
your planet in person, there 
would be no difficulty. But 10,000 light-years is an impossible 
barrier to all except thought 
waves, which, of course, travel at 
infinite speed. And this, as I said

before, is very unfortunate, because the human race is doomed." 

The tailor stiffened. "Doomed? 
Molly? My kids? All my customers?" 

"your customers?" yelped the 
woman in the housecoat. "How 
about mine? What's gonna happen , the world should be 
doomed?" 

Clocker found admiration for 
Dr. Harding's approach. It was 
a line tried habitually by politicians, but they didn't have the 
same kind of captive audience, 
the control, the contrived background. A cosmic pitch like this 
could bring a galactic payoff, 
whatever it might be. But it 
didn't take his mind off Zelda. 

"I see you are somewhat 
aghast," Dr. Harding observed. 
"But is my statement really so 
unexpected? You know the history of your own race — a record 
of incessant war, each more devastating than the last. Now, finally. Man has achieved the 
power of worldwide destruction. 
The next war, or the one after 
that, will unquestionably be the 
end not only of civilization, but 
of humanity — perhaps even your 
entire planet. Our peaceful, altruistic civilization might help 
avert catastrophe, but that would 
require our physical landing on 
Earth, which is not possible. Even 
if it were, there is not enough 
time. Armageddon draws near. 



"Then why have we brought 
you here?" asked Dr. Harding. 
"Because Man, in spite of his 
suicidal blunders, is a magnificent 
race. He must not vanish without 
leaving a complete record of his 
achievements." 

The crowd nodded soberly. 
Clocker wished he had a cigarette 
and his wife. In her right mind, 
Zelda was unswervingly practical 
and she would have had some 
noteworthy comments to make. 

"This is the task we must work 
together on," said Dr. Harding 
forcefully. "Each of you has a 
skill, a talent, a special knowledge we need for the immense 
record we are compiling. Every 
area of human society must be 
covered. We need you — urgently! 
Your data will become part of 
an imperishable social document 
that shall exist untold eons after 
mankind has perished." 

"tflSIBLY, the woman in the 
' housecoat was stunned. "They 
want to put down what / can 
tell them?" 

"And tailoring?" asked the little man with the pin-cushion vest. 
"How to make buttonholes and 
press clothes?" 

The man who looked like a 
banker had his chin up and a 
pleased expression on his pudgy 
face. 

"I always knew I'd be appreciated some day," he stated 



138 




 



smugly. "I can tell them things 
about finance that those idiots 
in the main office can't even guess 
at." 

Mr. Calhoun stood up beside 
Dr. Harding on the rostrum. He 
seemed infinitely benign as he 
raised his hands and his deep 
voice. 

"Friends, we need your help, 
your knowledge. I know you 
don't want the human race to 
vanish without a trace, as though 
it had never existed. I'm sure it 
thrills you to realize that some 
researcher, far in the future, will 
one day use the very knowledge 
that you gave. Think what it 
means to leave your personal imprint indelibly on cosmic history I" He paused and leaned 
forward. "Will you help us?" 

The faces glowed, the hands 
went up, the voices cried that 
they would. 

Dazzled by the success of the 
sell, Clocker watched the people 
happily and flatteredly follow 
their frock-coated guides toward 
the various buildings, which appeared to have been laid out according to very broad categories 
of human .occupation. 

He found himself impelled 
along with the chattering, excited woman in the housecoat toward a cerise structure marked 
SPORTS AND RACKETS. It 
seemed that she had been angry 
at not having been interviewed 



for a recent epic survey, and this 
was her chance to decant the 
experiences of twenty years. 

Clocker stopped listening to 
her gabble and looked for the 
building that Zelda would probably be in. He saw ARTS AND 
ENTERTAINMENT, but when 
he tried to go there, he felt some 
compulsion keep him heading toward his own destination. 

Looking back helplessly, he 
went inside. 

TTE found that he was in a 
cubicle with a fatherly kind 
of man who had thin gray hair, 
kindly eyes and a firm jaw, and 
who introduced himself as Eric 
Barnes. He took Clocker's name, 
age, specific trade, and gave him 
a serial - number which, he explained, would go on file at the 
central archives on his home 
planet, cross-indexed in multiple 
ways for instant reference. 

"Now," said Barnes, "here is 
our problem, Mr. Locke. We are 
making two kinds of perpetual 
records. One is written; more precisely, microscribed. The other is 
a wonderfully exact duplicate of 
your cerebral pattern — in more 
durable material than brain matter, of course." 

"Of course," Clocker said, nodding like an obedient patsy. 

"The verbal record is difficult 
enough, since much of the data 
you give us must be, by its na

13V 



ture, foreign to us. The duplication of your cerebral pattern, 
however, is even more troublesome. Besides the inevitable distortion caused by a distance of 
10.000 light-years and the fields 
of gravitation and radiation of 
all types intervening, the substance we use in place of brain 
cells absorbs memory quite slowly." Barnes smiled reassuringly. 
"But you'll be happy to know 
that the impression, once made, 
can never be lost or erased!" 

"Delighted," Clocker said flatly. "Tickled to pieces." 

"I knew you would be. Well, 
let us proceed. First, a basic description of horse racing." 

Clocker began to give it. 
Barnes held him down to a single sentence — "To check reception and retention," he said. 

The communication box on the 
desk lit up when Clocker repeated the sentence a few times, and 
a voice from the box said, "Increase output. Initial impression 
weak. Also wave distortion. Correct and continue." 

Barnes carefully adjusted the 
dials and Clocker went on repeating the sentence, slowing 
down to the speed Barnes requested. He did it automatically 
after a while, which gave him 
a chance to think. 

He had no plan to get Zelda 
out of here; he was improvising 
and he didn't like it. The setup 



still had him puzzled. He knew 
he wasn't dreaming all this, for 
there were details his imagination could never have supplied, 
and the notion of spirits with 
scientific devices would baffle 
even Oil Pocket. 

Everybody else appeared to accept these men as the aliens they 
claimed to be, but Clocker, fearing a con he couldn't understand, 
refused to. He had no other explanation, though, no evidence 
of any kind except deep suspicion of any noble-sounding enterprise. In his harsh experience, 
they always had a profit angle 
hidden somewhere. 

Until he knew more, he had to 
go along with the routine, hoping 
he would eventually find a way 
out for Zelda and himself. While 
he was repeating his monotonous 
sentence, he wondered what his 
body was doing back on Earth. 
Lying in a bed, probably, since 
he wasn't being asked to perform 
any physical jobs like Zelda's 
endless time-step. 

That reminded him of Doc 
Hawkins and the psychiatrists. 
There must be some here; he 
wished vengefully that he could 
meet them and see what they 
thought of their theories now. 

*T1HEN came the end of what 
was apparently the work day. 
"We're making splendid progress," Barnes told him. "I know 



140 




 



how tiresome it is to keep saying the same thing over and over, 
but the distance is such a great 
obstacle. I think it's amazing that 
we can even bridge it, don't you? 
Just imagine — the light that's 
reaching Earth at this very minute left our star when mammoths 
were roaming yOur western states 
and mankind lived in caves! And 
yet, with our thought-wave boosters, we are in instantaneous communication !" 

The soap, Clocker thought, to 
make him feel he was doing 
something important. 

"Well, you are doing something important," Barnes said, as 
though Clocker had spoken. 

Clocker would have turned red 
if he had been able to. As it was, 
he felt dismay and embarrassment. 

"Do you realize the size and 
value of this project?" Barnes 
went on. "We have a more detailed record of human society 
than Man himself ever had! 
There will be not even the most 
insignificant corner of your civilization left unrecorded ! Your 
life, my life — the life of this 
Zelda whom you came here to 
rescue — all are trivial, for we 
must die eventually, but the project will last eternally!" 

Clocker stood up, his eyes hard 
and worried. "You're telling me 
you know what I'm here for?" 

"To secure the return of your 



wife. I would naturally be aware 
that you had submitted yourself 
to our control voluntarily. It was 
in your file, which was sent to 
me by Admissions." 

"Then why did you let me in?" 

"Because, my dear friend — " 

"Leave out the 'friend' pitch. 
I'm here on business." 

Barnes shrugged. "As you wish. 
We let you in, as you express it, 
because you have knowledge that 
we should include in our archives. 
We hoped you would recognize 
the merit and scope of our undertaking. Most people do, once 
they are told." 

"Zelda, too?" 

"Oh, yes," Barnes said emphatically. "I had that checked 
by Statistics. She is extremely 
cooperative, quite convinced — " 

"Don't hand me that!" 

TJARNES rose. Straightening 
" the papers on his desk, he 
said, "You want to speak to her 
and see for yourself? Fair 
enough." 

He led Clocker out of the 
building. They crossed the great 
square to a vast, low structure 
that Barnes referred to as the 
Education and Recreation Center. 

"Unless there are special problems," Barnes said, "our human 
associates work twelve or fourteen of your hours, and the rest 
of the time is their own. Sleep

isn't necessary to the psychic 
projection, of course, though it is 
to the body on Earth. And what, 
Mr. Locke, would you imagine 
they choose as their main amusements?" 

"Pinball machines?" Clocker 
suggested ironically. "Crap 
games?" 

"Lectures," said Barnes with 
pride. "They are eager to learn 
everything possible about our 
project. We've actually had the 
director himself address them ! 
Oh, it was inspiring, Mr. Locke 
— color films in three dimensions, 
showing the great extent of our 
archives, the many millions of 
synthetic brains, each with indestructible memories of skills 
and crafts and professions and 
experiences that soon will be no 
more — " 

"Save it. Find Zelda for me 
and then blow. I want to talk 
to her alone." 

Barnes checked with the equivalent of a box office at the Center, where, he told Clocker, 
members of the audience and 
staff were required to report before entering, in case of emergency. 

"Like what?" Clocker asked. 

"You have a suspicious mind," 
said Barnes patiently. "Faulty 
neuron circuit in a synthetic duplicate brain, for example. Photon 
storms interfering with reception. 
Things of that sort." 



"So where's the emergency?" 

"We have so little time. We 
ask the human associate in question to record again whatever 
was not received. The percentage 
of refusal is actually zero! Isn't 
that splendid?" 

"Best third degree I ever heard 
of," Clocker admitted through 
clamped teeth. "The cops on 
Earth would sell out every guy 
they get graft from to buy a 
thing like this." 

rwiHEY found Zelda in a small 
lecture hall, where a matronly 
woman from the other planet was 
urging her listeners to conceal 
nothing, however intimate, while 
recording — "Because," she said, 
"this must be a psychological as 
well as a cultural and sociological history." 

Seeing Zelda, Clocker rushed 
to her chair, hauled her upright, 
kissed her, squeezed her. 

"Baby!" he said, more choked 
up than he thought his control 
would allow. "Let's get out of 
here!" 

She looked at him without 
surprise. "Oh, hello, Clocker. 
Later. I want to hear the rest of 
this lecture." 

"Ain't you glad to see me?" 
he asked, hurt. "I spend months 
and shoot every dime I got just 
to find you — " 

"Sure I'm glad to see you, 
hon," she said, trying to look past 



AT THE POST 



him at the speaker. "But this is 
so important — " 

Barnes came up, bowed politely. "If you don't mind, Miss 
Zelda, I think you ought to talk 
to your husband." 

"But what about "the lecture?" 
asked Zelda anxiously. 

"I can get a transcription for 
you to study later." 

"Well, all right," she agreed 
reluctantly. 

Barnes left them on a strangely warm stone bench in the great 
square, after asking them to report back to work at the usual 
time. Zelda, instead of looking 
at Clocker, watched Barnes walk 
away. Her eyes were bright; she 
almost radiated. 

"Isn't he wonderful, Clocker?" 
she said. "Aren't they all wonderful? Regular scientists, every 
one of them, devoting their whole 
life to this terrific cause!" 

"What's so wonderful about 
that?" he all but snarled. 

She turned and gazed at him 
in mild astonishment. "They 
could let the Earth go boom. It 
wouldn't mean a thing to them. 
Everybody wiped out just like 
there never were any people. Not 
even as much record of us as the 
■dinosaurs! Wouldn't that make 
you feel simply awful?" 

"I wouldn't feel a thing." He 
took her unresponsive hand. "All 
I'm worried about is us, baby. 
Who cares about the rest of the 



world doing a disappearing act?" 

"I do. And so do they. They 
aren't selfish like some people I 
could mention." 

"Selfish? You're damned right 
I am!" 

HE pulled her to him, kissed 
her neck in her favorite place. 
It got a reaction — restrained annoyance. 

"I'm selfish," he said, "because 
I got a wife I'm nuts about and 
I want her back. They got you 
wrapped, baby. Can't you see 
that? You belong with me in 
some fancy apartment, the minute I can afford it, like one I saw 
over on Riverside Drive — seven 
big rooms, three baths, one of 
them with a stall shower like you 
always wanted, the Hudson River 
and Jersey for our front lawn — " 
"That's all in the past, hon," 
she said with quiet dignity. "I 
have to help out on this project. 
It's the least I can do for history." 

"The hell with history! What 
did history ever do for us?" He 
put his mouth near her ear, 
breathing gently in the way that 
once used to make her squirm 
in his arms like a tickled doe. 
"Go turn in your time-card, 
baby. Tell them you got a date 
with me back on Earth." 

She pulled away and jumped 
up. "No! This is my job as much 
as theirs. More, even. They don't 



144 




 



keep anybody here against their 
will. I'm staying because I want 
to, Clocker." 

Furious, he snatched her off 
her feet. "I say you're coming 
back with me! If you don't want 
to, I'll drag you, see?" 

"How?" she asked calmly. 

He put her down again slowly, 
frustratedly. "Ask them to let 
you go, baby. Oil Pocket said 
he'd put you in a musical. You 
always did want to hit the big 
time — " 

"Not any more." She smoothed down her dress and patted up 
her hair. "Well, I want to catch 
the rest of that lecture, hon. See 
you around if you decide to 
stay." 

He sat down morosely and 
watched her snake-hip toward 
the Center, realizing that her seductive walk was no more than 
professional conditioning. She 
had grown in some mysterious 
way, become more serene — at 
peace. 

He had wondered what catatonics got for their work. He 
knew now — the slickest job of 
hypnotic flattery ever invented. 
That was their pay. 

But what did the pitchmen get 
in return? 

|^LOCKER put in a call for 
^ Barnes at the box office of 
the Center. Barnes left a lecture 
for researchers from his planet 



and joined Clocker with no more 
than polite curiosity on his paternal face. Clocker told him 
briefly and bitterly about his talk 
with Zetda, and asked bluntly 
what was in it for the aliens. 

"I think you can answer that," 
said Barnes. "You're a scientist 
of a sort. You determine the 
probable performance of a group 
of horses by their heredity, previous races and other factors. A 
very laborious computation, calling for considerable aptitude and 
skill. With that same expenditure 
of energy, couldn't you earn more 
in other fields?" 

"I guess so," Clocker said. 
"But I like the track." 

"Well, there you are. The only 
human form of gain we share is 
desire for knowledge. You devote your skill to predicting a 
race that is about to be run; we 
devote ours tc recording a race 
that is about to destroy itself." 

Clocker grabbed the alien's 
coat, pushed his face grimly 
close. "There, that's the hook! 
Take away the doom push and 
this racket folds." 

Barnes looked bewildered. "I 
don't comprehend — " 

"Listen, suppose everything's 
square. Let's say you guys really 
are leveling, these marks aren't 
being roped, you're knocking 
yourself out because your guess 
is that we're going to commit 
suicide." 



AT THE POST

"Oh." Barnes nodded somberly. "Is there any doubt of it? Do 
you honestly believe the holocaust 
can be averted?" 

"I think it can be stopped, 
yeah. But you birds act like you 
don't want it to be. You're just 
laying back, letting us bunch up, 
collecting the insurance before 
the spill happens." 

"What else can we do? We're 
scientists, not politicians. Besides, we've tried repeatedly to 
spread the warning and never 
once succeeded in transmitting 
it." 

Clocker released his grip on 
the front of Barnes's jacket. "You 
take me to the president or commissioner or whoever runs this 
club. Maybe we can work something out." 

"We have a board of directors," Barnes said doubtfully. 
"But I can't see — " 

"Don't rupture yourself trying. 
Just take me there and let me 
do the talking." 

Barnes moved his shoulders 
resignedly. He led Clocker to the 
Administration Building and inside to a large room with paneled 
walls, a long, solid table and 
heavy, carved chairs. The men 
who sat around the table appeared as solid and respectable as 
the furniture. Clocker's guess was 
that they had been chosen deliberately, along with the decorations, to inspire confidence in the 



customer. He had been in rigged 
horse parlors and bond stores 
and he knew the approach. 

T%|"R. CALHOUN, the character 
-L" with the white beard, was 
chairman of the board. He looked unhappily at Clocker. 

"I was afraid there would be 
trouble," he said. "I voted 
against accepting you, you know. 
My colleagues, however, thought 
that you, as our first voluntary 
associate, might indicate new 
methods, but I fear my judgment has been vindicated." 

"Still, if he knows how extinction can be prevented — " began 
Dr. Harding, the one who had 
given the orientation lecture. 

"He knows no such thing," a 
man with several chins said in 
an emphatic basso voice. "Man is 
the most destructive dominant 
race we have ever encountered. 
He despoiled his own planet, exterminated lower species that 
were Important to his own existence, oppressed, suppressed, 
brutalized, corrupted — it's the 
saddest chronicle in the Universe." 

"Therefore his achievements," 
said Dr. Harding, "deserve all 
the more recognition!" 

Clocker broke in: "If you'll 
lay off the gab, I'd like to get my 
bet down." 

"Sorry," said Mr. Calhoun. 
"Please proceed, Mr. Locke." 



146 




 



Clocker rested his knuckles on 
the table and leaned over them. 
"I have to take your word you 
ain't human, but you don't have 
to take mine. I never worried 
about anybody but Zelda and 
myself; that makes me human. 
All I want is to get along and 
not hurt anybody if 1 can help 
it: that makes me what some 
people call the common man. 
Some of my best friends are 
common men. Come to think of 
it, they all are. They wouldn't 
want to get extinct. If we do, it 
won't be our fault." 

Several of the men nodded 
sympathetic agreement. 

"I don't read much except the 
sport sheets, but I got an idea 
what's coming up," Clocker continued, "and it's a long shot that 
any country can finish in the 
money. We'd like to stop war for 
good, all of us. Little guys who 
do the fighting and the dying. 
Yeah, and lots of big guys, too. 
But we can't do it alone." 

"That's precisely our point," 
said Calhoun. 

"I mean us back on Earth. 
People are afraid, but they just 
don't know for sure that we can 
knock ourself off. Between these 
catatonics and me, we could tell 
them what it's all about. I notice you got people from all over 
the world here, all getting along 
fine because they have a job to 
do and no time to hate each 



other. Well, it could be like that 
on Earth. You let us go back and 
you'll see a selling job on making it like up here like you never 
saw before." 

Mr. Calhoun and Dr. Harding 
looked at each other and around 
the table. Nobody seemed willing 
to answer. 

Mr. Calhoun finally sighed 
and got out of his big chair. "Mr. 
Locke, besides striving for international understanding, we have 
experimented in the manner you 
suggest. We released many of our 
human associates to tell what our 
science predicts on the basis of 
probability. A human psychological mechanism defeated us." 

"Yeah?" Clocker asked warily. 
"What was that?" 

"Protective amnesia. They 
completely and absolutely forgot 
everything they had learned 
here." 

/^LOCKER slumped a bit. "I 
^-^ know. I talked to some of 
these 'cured' catatonics — people 
you probably sprung because you 
got all you wanted from them, 
They didn't remember anything." 
He braced again. "Look, there 
has to be a way out. Maybe if 
you snatch these politicians in all 
the countries, yank them up here, 
they couldn't stumble us into a 
war." 

"Examine your history," said 
Dr. Harding sadly, "and you will 



AT THE POST 



147 



find that we have done this experimentally. It doesn't work. 
There are always others, often 
more unthinking, ignorant, stupid 
or vicious, ready to take their 
places." 

Clocker looked challengingly 
at every member of the board of 
directors before demanding, 
"What are the odds on me remembering?" 

"You are our first volunteer," 
said a little man at the side of 
the table. "Any answer we give 
would be a guess." 

"All right, guess." 

"We have a theory that your 
psychic censor might not operate. Of course, you realize that's 
only a theory — " 

"That ain't all I don't realize. 
What's it mean?" 

"Our control, regrettably, is a 
wrench to the mind. Lifting it 
results in amnesia, which is a 
psychological defense against 
disturbing memories," 

"I walked into this, don't forget," Clocker reminded him. "I 
didn't know what I was getting 
into, but I was ready to take anything." 

"That," said the little man, "is 
the unknown factor. Yes, you did 
submit voluntarily and you were 
ready to take anything — but 
were you psychologically prepared for this? We don't know. 
We think there may be no characteristic wrench — " 



"Meaning I won't have amnesia?" 

"Meaning that you may not. 
We cannot be certain until a test 
has been made." 

"Then," said Clocker, "I want 
a deal. It's Zelda I want; you 
know that, at any rate. You say 
you're after a record of us in 
case we bump ourself off, but 
you also say you'd like us not 
to. I'll buy that, I don't want us 
to, either, and there's a chance 
that we can stop it together." 

"An extremely remote one," 
Mr. Calhoun stated. 

"Maybe, but a chance. Now if 
you let me out and I'm the first 
case that don't get amnesia, I 
can tell the world about all this. 
I might be able to steer other 
guys, scientists and decent politicians, into coming here to get 
the dope straighter than I could. 
Maybe thafd give Earth a 
chance to cop a pardon on getting extinct. Even if it don't work, 
it's better than hanging around 
the radio waiting for the results." 

DR. HARDING hissed on his 
glasses and wiped them 
thoughtfully, an adopted mannerism, obviously, because he 
seemed to see as well without 
them. "You have a point, Mr. 
Locke, but it would mean losing your contribution to our 
archives." 

"Well, which is more impor

tant?" Clocker argued. "Would 
you rather have my record than 
have us save ourself?" 

"Both," said Mr. Calhoun. 
"We see very little hope of your 
success, while we regard your 
knowledge as having important 
sociological significance. A very 
desirable contribution." 

The others agreed. 

"Look, I'll come back if I lame 
out," Clocker desperately offered. 
"You can pick me up any time 
you want. But if I make headway, you got to let Zelda go, 
too." 

"A reasonable proposition," 
said Dr. Harding. "I call for a 
vote." 

They took one. The best 
Clocker could get was a compromise. 

"We will lift our control," Mr. 
Calhoun said, "for a suitable 
time. If you can arouse a measurable opposition to racial suicide — measurable, mind you ; 
we're not requiring that you reverse the lemming march alone 
— we agree to release your wife 
and revise our policy completely. 
If, on the other hand, as seems 
more likely — " 

"I come back here and go on 
giving you the inside on racing," 
Clocker finished for him. "How 
much time do I get?" 

Dr. Harding turned his hands 
palm up on the table. "We do 
not wish to be arbitrary. We 



earnestly hope you gain your objective and we shall give you 
every opportunity to do so. If 
you fail, you will know it. So 
shall we." 

"You're pretty sure I'll get 
scratched, aren't you?" Clocker 
asked angrily. "It's like me telling a jockey he don't stand a 
chance — he's whammied before 
he even gets to the paddock. Anybody'd think do-gooders like you 
claim you are would wish me 
luck." 

"But we do!" exclaimed Mr. 
Calhoun. He shook Clocker's 
hand warmly and sincerely. 
"Haven't we consented to release 
you? Doesn't this prove our honest concern? If releasing all our 
human associates would save humanity, we would do so instantly. But we have tried again and 
again. And so, to use your own 
professional terminology, we are 
hedging our bets by continuing 
to make our anthropological record until you demonstrate another method ... if you do." 

"Good enough," approved 
Clocker. "Thanks for the kind 
word." 

The other board members followed and shook Clocker's hand 
and wished him well. 

Barnes, being last, did the 
same and added, "You may see 
your wife, if you care to, before 
you leave." 

"If I care to?" Clbcker re

peated. "What in hell do you 
think I came here for in the first 
place?" 

^TELDA was brought to him 
^ and they were left alone in 
a pleasant reading room. Soft 
music came from the walls, 
which glowed with enough light 
to read by. Zelda's lovely face 
was warm with emotion when she 
sat down beside him and put her 
hands in his. 

"They tell me you're leaving, 
hon," she said. 

"1 made a deal, baby. If it 
works — well, it'll be like it was 
before, only better." 

"I hate to see you leave. Not 
just for me," she added as he lit 
up hopefully. "I still love you, 
hon, but it's different now. I used 
to want you near me every minute. Now it's loving you without 
starving for you. You know what 
I mean?" 

"That's just the control they 
got on you. It's like that with 
me, too, only I know what it is 
and you don't." 

"But the big thing is the project. Why, we're footnotes in history! Stay here, hon. I'd feel so 
much better knowing you were 
here, making your contribution 
like they say." 

He kissed her lips. They were 
soft and warm and clinging, and 
so were her arms around his neck. 
This was more like the Zelda he 



had been missing. 

"They gave you a hypo, sweetheart," he told her. "You're 
hooked; I'm not. Maybe being 
a footnote is more important 
than doing something to save our 
skin, but I don't think so. If I 
can do anything about it, I want 
to do it." 

"Like what?" 

'T don't know," he admitted. 
"I'm hoping I get an idea when 
I'm paroled." 

She nuzzled under his chin. 
"Hon, I want you and me to be 
footnotes. I want it awful bad." 

"That's not what really counts, 
baby. Don't you see that? It's 
having you and stopping us humans from being just a bunch 
of old footnotes, Once we do that, 
we can always come back here 
and make the record, if it means 
that much to you." 

"Oh, it does!" 

He stood and drew her up so 
he could hold her more tightly. 
"You do want to go on being 
my wife, don't you, baby?" 

"Of course! Only I was hoping 
it could be here." 

"Well, it can't. But that's all 
I wanted to know. The rest is 
just details." 

He kissed her again, including 
the side of her neck, which produced a subdued wriggle of 
pleasure, and then he went back 
to the Administration Building 
for his release.

AWAKENING was no more 
complicated than opening his 
eyes, except for a bit of fogginess and fatigue that wore off 
quickly, and Clocker saw he was 
in a white room with a doctor, 
a nurse and an orderly around 
his bed. 

"Reflexes normal," the doctor 
said. He told Clocker, "You see 
and hear us. You know what I'm 
saying." 

"Sure," Clocker replied. "Why 
shouldn't I?" 

"That's right," the doctor 
evaded. "How do you feel?" 

Clocker thought about it. He 
was a little thirsty and the idea 
of a steak interested him, but 
otherwise he felt no pain or confusion. He remembered that he 
had not been hungry or thirsty 
for a long time, and that made 
him recall going over the border 
after Zelda. 

There were no gaps in his recollection. 

He didn't have protective amnesia. 

"You know what it's like 
there ?" he asked the doctor 
eagerly. "A big place where 
everybody from all over the 
world tell these aliens about their 
job or racket." He frowned. "I 
just remembered something funny. Wonder why I didn't notice 
it at the time. Everybody talks 
the same language. Maybe that's 
because there's only one language 



for thinking." He shrugged off 
the problem. "The guys who run 
the shop take it all down as a 
record for whoever wants to 
know about us a zillion years 
from now. That's on account of 
us humans are about to close 
down the track and go home." 

The doctor bent close intently. 
"Is that what you believe now 
or — while you were — disturbed?" 

Clocker's impulse to blurt the 
whole story was stopped at the 
gate. The doctor was staring too 
studiously at him. He didn't have 
his story set yet ; he needed time 
to think, and that meant getting 
out of this hospital and talking 
it over with himself. 

"You kidding?" he asked, 
using the same grin that he met 
complainers with when his turf 
predictions went sour. "While my 
head was out of the stirrups, of 
course." 

The doctor, the nurse and the 
orderly relaxed. * 

"T OUGHT to write a book," 
Clocker went on, being doggedly humorous. "What screwball ideas I got! How'd I act?" 

"Not bad," said the orderly. 
"When I found you yakking in 
your wife's room, I thought maybe it was catching and I'd better 
go find another job. But Doc 
here told me I was too stable to 
go psychotic." 

"I wasn't any trouble?" 



152 




 



"Nah. All you did was talk 
about how to handicap races. I 
got quite a few pointers. Hell, 
you went over them often 
enough for anybody to get them 
straight!" 

"I'm glad somebody made a 
profit," said Clocker. He asked 
the doctor, "When do I get out 
of here?" 

"We'll have to give you a few 
tests first." 

"Bring them on," Clocker said 
confidently. 

They were clever tests, designed to trip him into revealing 
whether he still believed in his 
delusions. But once he realized 
that, he meticulously joked about 
them, 

"Well?" he asked when the 
tests were finished. 

"You're all right," said the 
doctor, "Just try not to worry 
about your wife, avoid overworking, get plenty of rest — " 

Before Clocker left, he went to 
see Zelda. She had evidently recorded the time-step satisfactorily, because she was on a soft-shoe 
routine that she must have known 
cold by the time she'd been ten. 

He kissed her unresponsive 
mouth, knowing that she was far 
away in space and could not feel, 
see or hear him. But that didn't 
matter. He felt his own good, 
honest, genuine longing for her, 
unchecked by the aliens' control 
of emotions. 



"I'll spring you yet, baby," he 
said. "And what I told you about 
that big apartment on Riverside 
Drive still goes. We'll have a 
time together that ought to be 
a footnote in history all by itself. I'll see you . . . after I get 
the real job done." 

He heard the soft-shoe rhythm 
all the way down the corridor, 
out of the hospital, and clear 
back to the city. 

|"<LOCKER'S bank balance was 
^ sick, the circulation of his 
tip sheet gone. But he didn't 
worry about it; there were bigger problems. 

He studied the newspapers before even giving himself time to 
think. The news was as bad as 
usual. He could feel the heat of 
fission, close his eyes and see all 
the cities and farms in the world 
going up in a blinding cloud. As 
far as he was concerned, Barnes 
and Harding and the rest weren't 
working fast enough; he could 
see doom sprinting in half a field 
ahead of the completion of the 
record. 

The first thing he should have 
done was recapture the circulation of the tip sheet. The first 
thing he actually did do was 
write the story of his experience 
just as it had happened, and send 
it to a magazine. 

When he finally went to work 
on his sheet, it was to cut down 



AT THE POST 



153 



the racing data to a few columns 
and fill the rest of it with warnings. 

"This is what you want?" the 
typesetter asked, staring at the 
copy Clocker turned, in. "You 
sure this is what you want?" 

"Sure I'm sure. Set it and let's 
get the edition out early. I'm 
doubling the print order." 

"Doubling?" 

"You heard me." 

When the issue was out, 
Clocker waited around the main 
newsstands on Broadway. He 
watched the customers buy, study 
unbelievingly, and wander off 
looking as if all the tracks in 
the country had burned down simultaneously. 

Doc Hawkins found him there. 

"Clocker, my boy! You have 
no idea how anxious we were 
about you. But you're looking 
fit, I'm glad to say." 

"Thanks," Clocker said abstractedly. "I wish I could say 
the same about you and the rest 
of the world." 

Doc laughed. "No need to worry about us. We'll muddle along 
somehow." 

"You think so, huh?" 

"Well, if the end is approaching, let us greet it at the Blue 
Ribbon. I believe we can still 
find the lads there." 

They were, and they greeted 
Clocker with gladness and drinks. 
Diplomatically, they made only 



the most delicate references to 
the revamping job Clocker had 
done on his tip sheet. 

"It's just like opening night, 
that's all," comforted Arnold 
Wilson Wyle. "You'll get back 
into your routine pretty soon." 

"I don't want to," said Clocker 
pugnaciously. "Handicapping is 
only a way to get people to read 
what I really want to tell them." 

"Took me many minutes to 
find horses," Oil Pocket put in. 
"See one I want to bet on, but 
rest of paper make me too worried to bother betting. Okay with 
Injun, though — horse lost. And 
soon you get happy again, stick 
to handicapping, let others worry 
about world." 

Buttonhole tightened his grip 
on Clocker's lapel. "Sure, boy. As 
long as the bobtails run, who 
cares what happens to anything 
else?" 

"Maybe I went too easy," said 
Clocker tensely. "I didn't print 
the whole thing, just a little part 
of it. Here's the rest." 

THEY were silent while he 
talked, seeming stunned with 
the terrible significance of his 
story. 

"Did you explain all this to 
the doctors?" Doc Hawkifis 
asked. 

"You think I'm crazy?" 
Clocker retorted. "They'd have 
kept me packed away and I'd 



154 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



never get a crack at telling anybody." 

"Don't let it trouble you," said 
Doc. "Some vestiges of delusion 
can be expected to persist for a 
while, 1 but you'll get rid of them. 
I have faith in your ability to 
distinguish between the real and 
unreal." 

"But it all happened! If you 
guys don't believe me, who will? 
And you've got to so I can get 
Zelda back!" 

"Of course, of course," said 
Doc hastily. "We'll discuss it 
further some other time. Right 
now I really must start putting 
my medical column together for 
the paper." 

"What about you, Handy 
Sam?" Clocker challenged. 

Handy Sam, with one foot up 
on the table and a pencil between his toes, was doodling selfconsciously on a paper napkin. 
"We all get these ideas, Clocker. 
I used to dream about having 
arms and I'd wake up still thinking so, till I didn't know if I did 
or didn't. But like Doc says, then 
you figure out what's real and 
it don't mix you up any more." 

"All right," Clocker said belligerently to Oil Pocket. "You 
think my story's batty, too?" 

"Can savvy evil spirits, good 
spirits," Oil Pocket replied with 
stolid tact. "Injun spirits, though, 
not white ones." 

"But I keep telling you they 



ain't spirits. They ain't even 
man. They're from some world 
way across the UniverseOil Pocket shook his head. 
"Can savvy Injun spirits, 
Clocker. No spirits, no savvy." 

"Look, you see the mess we're 
all in, don't you?" Clocker appealed to the whole group. "Do 
you mean to tell me you can't 
feel we're getting set to blow the 
joint? Wouldn't you want to stop 
it?" 

"If we could, my boy, gladly," 
Doc said. "However, there's not 
much that any individual or 
group of individuals can do." 

"But how in hell does anything get started? With one guy, 
two guys — before you know it, 
you got a crowd, a political party, 
a country — " 

"What about the other countries, though?" asked Buttonhole. "So we're sold on your story 
in America, let's say. What do 
we do — let the rest of the world 
walk in and take us over?" 

"We educate them," Clocker 
explained despairingly. "We start 
it here and it spreads to there. 
It doesn't have to be everybody. 
Mr. Calhoun said I just have to 
convince a few people and that'll 
show them it can be done and 
then I get Zelda back." 

Doc stood up and glanced 
around the table. "I believe I 
speak for all of us, Clocker, when 
I state that we shall do all with

in our power to aid you." 

"Like telling other people?" 
Clocker asked eagerly. 

"Well, that's going pretty — " 

"Forget it, then. Go write your 
column. I'll see you chumps 
around — around ten miles up, 
shaped like a mushroom." 

He stamped out, so angry that 
he untypically let the others settle his bill. 

/^LOCKER'S experiment with 
^ the newspaper failed so badly 
that it was not worth the expense 
of putting it out; people refused 
to buy. Clocker had three-sheets 
printed and hired sandwich men 
to parade them through the city. 
He made violent speeches in Columbus Circle, where he lost his 
audience to revivalist orators; 
Union Square, where he was told 
heatedly to bring his message to 
Wall Street; and Times Square, 
where the police made him move 
along so he wouldn't block traffic. He obeyed, shouting his message as he walked, until he 
remembered how amusedly he 
used to listen to those who cried 
that Doomsday was near. He 
wondered if they were catatonics 
under imperfect control. It didn't 
matter; nobody paid serious attention to his or their warnings. 

The next step, logically, was a 
barrage of letters to the heads of 
nations, to the U.N., to editors 
of newspapers. Only a few of his 



letters were printed. The ones in 
Doc's tabloid did best, drawing 
such comments as: 

"Who does this jerk think he 
is, telling us everybody's going 
to get killed off? Maybe they 
will, but not in Brooklyn!" 

"When I was a young girl, 
some fifty years ago, I had a similar experience to Mr. Locke's. 
But my explanation is quite simple. The persons I saw proved to 
be my ancestors. Mr. Locke's 
new-found friends will* I am sure, 
prove to be the same. The World 
Beyond knows all and tells all, 
and my Control, with whom I am 
in daily communication Over 
There, assures me that mankind 
is in no danger whatever, except 
from the evil effects of tobacco 
and alcohol and trie disrespect of 
youth for their elders." 

"The guy's nuts! He ought to 
go back to Russia. He's nothing 
but a nut or a Communist and 
in my book that's the same 
thing." 

"He isn't telling us anything 
new. We all know who the enemy 
is. The only way to protect ourselves is to build TWO GUNS 
FOR ONE!" 

"Is this Locke character selling us the idea that we all ought 
to go batty to save the world?" 

Saddened and defeated, Clocker went through his accumulated 
mail. There were politely noncommittal acknowledgments 



156 

V 




 



from embassies and the U.N. 
There was also a check for his 
article from the magazine he'd 
sent it to; the amount was astonishingly large. 

He used part of it to buy radio 
time, the balance for ads in rural 
newspapers and magazines. City 
people, he figured, were hardened by publicity gags, and he 
might stir up the less suspicious 
and sophisticated hinterland. The 
replies he received, though, advised him to buy some farmland 
and let the metropolises be destroyed, which, he was assured, 
would be a mighty good thing all 
around. 

The magazine came out the 
same day he tried to get into 
the U.N. to shout a speech from 
the balcony. He was quietly surrounded by a uniformed guard 
and moved, rather than forced, 
outside. 

TIE went dejectedly to his hotel. 

He stayed there for several days, dialing numbers he 
selected randomly from the telephone book, and getting the 
brushoff from business offices, 
housewives and maids. They were 
all very busy or the boss wasn't 
in or they expected important 
calls. 

That was when he was warmly 
invited by letter to see the editor 
of the magazine that had bought 
his article. 



Elated for actually the first 
time since his discharge from the 
hospotal, Clocker took a cab to 
a handsome building, showed his 
invitation to a pretty and courteous receptionist, and was escorted into an elaborate office 
where a smiing man came 
around a wide bleached -mahogany desk and shook hands with 
him. 

"Mr. Locke," said the editor, 
"I'm happy to tell you that we've 
had a wonderful response to your 
story." 

"Article," Clocker corrected. 

The editor smiled. "Do you 
produce so much that you can't 
remember what you sold us? It 
was about — " 

"I know," Clocker cut in. "But 
it wasn't a story. It was an article. It really — " 

"Now, now. The first thing a 
writer must learn is not to take 
his ideas too seriously. Very 
dangerous, especially in a piece 
of fiction like yours." 

"But the whole thing is true!" 

"Certainly — while you were 
writing it." The editor shoved a 
pile of mail across the desk toward him. "Here are some of the 
comments that have come in. I 
think you'll enjoy seeing the reaction." 

Clocker went through them, 
hoping anxiously for no more 
than a single note that would 
show his message had come 



AT THE POST 



through to somebody. He finished and looked up blankly. 

"You see?" the editor asked 
proudly. "You're a find." 

"The new Mark Twain or Jonathan Swift, A comic." 

"A satirist,", the editor amended. He leaned across the desk 
on his crossed forearms. "A mail 
response like this indicates a talent worth developing. We would 
like to discuss a series of stories — " 

"Articles." . 

"Whatever you choose to call 
them. We're prepared to — " 

"You ever been off your rocker?" Clocker asked abruptly. 

rriHE editor sat back, smiling 
■*■ with polite puzzlement. "Why, 
no." 

"You ought to try it some 
time." Clocker lifted himself out 
of the chair and went to the 
door. "That's what I want, what 
I was trying to sell in my article. 
We all ought to go to hospitals 
and get ourself let in and have 
these aliens take over and show 
us where we're going." 

"You think that would be an 
improvement?" 

"What wouldn't?" asked 
Glocker, opening the door. 

"But about the series — " 

"I've got your name and address. I'll let you know if anything turns up. Don't call me; 
I'll call you." 



Clocker closed the door behind 
him, went out of the handsome 
building and called a taxi. All 
through the long ride, he stared 
at the thinning out of the city, 
the huddled suburban communities, the stretches of grass and 
well-behaved woods that were 
permitted to survive. 

He climbed out at Glendale 
Center Hospital, paid the hackie, 
and went to the admitting desk. 
The nurse gave him a smile. 

"We were wondering when 
you'd come visit your wife," she 
said. "Been away?" 

"Sort of," he answered, with 
as little emotion as he had felt 
while he was being controlled. 
"I'll be seeing plenty of her from 
now on. I want my old room 
back." 

"But you're perfectly normal!" 

"That depends on how you 
look at it. Give me ten minutes 
alone and any brain vet will be 
glad to give me a cushioned 
room." 

Hands in his pockets, Clocker 
went into the elevator, walked 
down the corridor to his old 
room without pausing to visit 
Zelda. It was the live Zelda he 
wanted to see, not the tapping 
automaton. 

He went in and shut the door. 

"f~|KAY, you were right and I 
was wrong," Clocker told 
the board of directors. "Turn me 



158 




 



over to Barnes and I'll give him 
the rest of the dope on racing. 
Just let me see Zelda once in a 
while and you won't have any 
trouble with me." 

"Then you are convinced that 
you have failed," said Mr. Calhoun. 

"I'm no dummy. I know when 
I'm licked. I also pay anything 
I owe." 

Mr. Calhoun leaned back. 
"And so do we, Mr. Locke. Naturally, you have no way of detecting the effect you've had. We 
do. The result is that, because 
of your experiment, we are gladly revising our policy." 

"Huh?" Clocker looked around 
at the comfortable aliens in their 
comfortable chairs. Solid and respectable, every one of them. "Is 
this a rib?" 

"Visits to catatonics have increased considerably," explained 
Dr. Harding. "When the visitors 
are alone with our human associates, they tentatively follow the 
directions you gave in your article. Not all do, to.be sure; only 
those who feel as strongly about 
being with their loved ones as 
you do about your wife." 

"We have accepted four voluntary applicants," said Mr. Calhoun. 

Clocker's mouth seemed to be 
filled with cracker crumbs that 
wouldn't go down and allow him 
to speak. 



"And now," Dr. Harding went 
on, "we are setting up an Information Section to teach the applicants what you have learned 
and make the same arrangement 
we made with you. We are certain that we shall, before long, 
have to increase our staff as the 
number of voluntary applicants 
increases geometrically, after we 
release the first few to continue 
the work you have so admirably 
begun." 

"You mean I made it?" Clocker croaked unbelievingly. 

"Perhaps this will prove it to 
you." said Mr. Calhoun. 

He motioned and the door 
opened and Zelda came in. 

"Hello, hon," she said. "I'm 
glad you're back. I missed you." 

"Not like I missed you, baby! 
There wasn't anybody controlling my feelings." 

Mr. Calhoun put his hands on 
their shoulders. "Whenever you 
care to, Mr. Locke, you and your 
wife are free to leave." 

Clocker held Zelda's hands and 
her calmly fond gaze. "We owe 
these guys plenty, baby," he said 
to her. "We'll help make the record before we take off. Ain't that 
what you want?" 
, "Oh, it is, hon! And then I 
want you." 

"Then let's get started," he 
said. "The quicker we do, the 
quicker we get back."
