I HAVEN'T got an editorial and 
it's too late to write one. It's two 
a. m. on a Monday morning — the 
Monday this issue has to go to the 
printer. 

I had an editorial. But I'm in 
Kingston and the editorial is lying 
on the table down in Patterson. 
That's forty miles from here and 
there isn't time to go get it. 

The rest of the issue is all ready 
to go. I left Patterson Saturday and 
drove down to New York City and 
took the readied manuscripts with 
me. Saturday evening I went up to 
see Horace Gold, the guy that puts 
out a stf mag called Galaxy. He 
lives in a big ant hill on Fourteenth 
Street and a lot of people drop in. 
We killed some time and I gave him 
a copy — for free — of IF, and then 
I went out and found a parking 
ticket on my car. Fifteen bucks. Fifteen bucks, they charge in that town 
for putting your car in the wrong 
place! They were having a little financial trouble, but I sent in a 
check for the fine, so I guess their 
money matters are all straightened 
out now. 



My car runs pretty good. I've 
only had it a couple of months. It's 
a 1946 Cadillac, but it had only 
been driven a few thousand miles 
and it's just like new and I got a 
terrific bargain on it. 
' I was going to buy a Ford or a 
Chevy, but the man came along 
with this one and showed me where 
it's a lot more economical in the 
long run. This car, he said, will last 
me all my life, where a light car 
falls to pieces after about thirty 
years. You take care of a Cadillac 
and it will never let you down. In 
the long run you save a lot of 
money. 

What a line of malarky! Suretake care of it and it'll take care of 
you. New tires at forty bucks a 
throw. High test gas — only the best. 
Drain the crankcase every thousand 
miles, And use only t£e best oil — 
the kind they bring around in an 
armoured car. 

Brother, I've been had! If tha^ 
old 1937 Dodge I came east imk 
hadn't dropped its motor in the ' 
middle of the road, I'd still be a 
happy guy. 



ANYHOW, I drove straight up 
here to Kingston from Manhattan and didn't stop off at Patterson, 
so that's why I haven't got an editorial. 



I WISH I had that editorial because it was a pretty good one. I 
spent a lot of time on it. 

It was all about how lucky we 
are to be living now — in this fan


tastic, scientific age. About all the 
things we have — arid take for granted — that are so wonderful. Not the 
big things necessarily. The little 
things. The allegedly common ordinary things. 

Like, for instance, a tooth brush 
and a tube of tooth paste and a visit 
to a dentist. It's a matter of historical record that Queen Elizabeth, back around the Middle Ages, 
who had everything the people of 
that time could devise, always held 
a fan in front of her face when she 
talked. That was to cover her decayed and blackened teeth. The 
queen of a great nation, and when 
her teeth went, they went. There 
was nothing on the face of the earth 
that could be done about it. 

So you and I have got what kings 
and queens w6uld have given fortunes to possess. A clean and efficient set of teeth. Even if they're 
the kind you take out at night — 
they're still clean and efficient. You 
should go to the museum sometime 
and see what George Washington 
had to put up withi 



AS A matter of fact, the premise 
can be cut a lot finer. Think how 
lucky you and I are .to be Americans and live in the United States. 
Have you, as an example, ever been 
hungry? By that I don't mean just 
ready for dinner. I mean really 
hungry deep down in the bone — 
down to the point where getting 
something to eat is the most important single ambition of life. 

By far the majority of people on 
this earth are that way all the time. 
There are millions of people living 
today — this minute — who have 



never, at any time in their lives, had 
enough to eat. There are people living today who have never seen a 
bar of soap, have never seen a moving picture show ; have never tasted 
an ice cream soda or a piece of 
roast beef. The point is worth a moment's thankfulness for being who 
you are — living in the place you 
are — in these times of pure magic. 
That's what the editorial was 
about and it was a pretty good one. 
I wish I had it here. 



I THINK we've got some pretty 
good stories in this issue. If you 
don't get a chance to read anything 
else in the book, don't miss Charley 
Beaumont's The Beautiful People. 
This will be a good chance to see 
how our tastes jibe. I think the yarn 
has everything. 

Incidentally, the Mari Wolf that 
wrote An Empty Bottle, is Rog 
Phillip's wife. She does nice work. 

I don't know who T. D. Hamm 
is. I bought his Last Supper 
through an agent, but it's one of 
the most chilling short-shorts I've 
ever read. The short-short is supposed to be the hardest type of fiction to do. I think it must be, because you find a good one once in 
a blue moon. If Last Supper isn't 
snapped up for an anthology, I'll be 
badly mistaken. 

By the way, Walt Miller's It 
Takes A Thief was grabbed by 
Shasta for their 1952 Anthology. 
It appeared in the May issue of IF. 
My favorite in that issue was Infinity's Child by DeVet. 

Sorry about not having the editorial. I'll run it next issue if I can 
find it. — pwf

Mary was a misfit. She didn't want to be 
beautiful. And she wasted time doing mad 
things — like eating and sleeping. 

The Beautiful People 

By Charles Beaumont 



MARY sat quietly and watched 
the handsome man's legs 
blown off; watched further as the 
great ship began to crumple and 
break into small pieces in the middle of the blazing night. She fidgeted slightly as the men and the parts 
of the men came floating dreamily 
through the wreckage out into the 
awful silence. And when the meteorite shower came upon the men, 
gouging holes through everything, 



tearing flesh and ripping bones, 
Mary closed her eyes. 

"Mother." 

Mrs. Cuberle glanced up from 
her magazine. 

"Hmm?" 

"Do we have to wait much longer?" 

"I don't think so. Why?" 

Mary said nothing but looked at 
the moving wall. 

"Oh, that." Mrs. Cuberle laughed 



CHARLES BEAUMONT 



and shook her head. "That tired 
old thing. Read a magazine, Mary, 
like I'm doing. We've all seen that 
a million times." 

"Does it have to be on, Mother?" 

"Well, nobody seems to be watching. I don't think the doctor would 
mind if I switched it off." 

Mrs. Cuberle rose from the couch 
and walked to the wall. She depressed a little button and the life 
went from the wall, flickering and 
glowing. 

Mary opened her eyes. 

"Honestly," Mrs. Cuberle said to 
a woman sitting beside her, "you'd 
think they'd try to get something 
else. We might as well go to the 
museum and watch the first landing 
on Mars. The Mayoraka Disaster — 
really!" 

The Woman replied without distracting her eyes from the magazine page. "It's the doctor's idea. 
Psychological." 

Mrs. Cuberle opened her mouth 
and moved her head up and down 
•knowingly. 

"Ohhh. I should have known 
there was some reason. Still, who 
watches it?" 

"The children do. Makes them 
think, makes them grateful or something." 

"Ohhh." 

"Psychological." 

Mary picked up a magazine and 
leafed through the pages. All photographs, of women and men. Women 
like Mother and like the others in 
the room; slender, tanned, shapely, 
beautiful women; and men with 
large muscles and shiny hair. Wornen and men, all looking alike, all 
perfect and beautiful. She folded 
the magazine and wondered how 



to answer the questions that wduld 
be asked. 

"Mother—" 

"Gracious, what is it now! Can't 
you sit still for a minute?" 

"But we've been here three 
hours." 

Mrs. Cuberle sniffed. 

"Do— do I really have to?" 

"Now don't be silly, Mary. After 
those terrible things you told me, of 
course you do." 

An olive-skinned woman in a 
transparent white uniform came 
into the reception room. 

"Cuberle. Mrs.»Zena Cuberle?" 

"Yes.". 

"Doctor will see you now." 

Mrs. Cuberle took Mary's hand 
and they walked behind the nurse 
down a long corridor. 

A man who seemed in his middle 
twenties looked up from a desk. He 
smiled and gestured toward two adjoining chairs. 

"Well— well." 

"Doctor Hortel, I—" 



THE doctor snapped his fingers. 

"Of course, I know. Your daughter. Ha ha, I certainly do know 
your trouble. Get so many of them 
nowadays — stakes up most of my 
time." 

"You do?" asked Mrs. Cuberle. 
"Frankly, it had begun to upset 
me." 

"Upset? Hmm. Not good. Not 
good at all. Ah, but then — if people 
did not get upset, we psychiatrists 
would be out of a job, eh? Go the 
way of the early M. D. But, I assure you, I need hear no more." He 
turned his handsome face to Mary. 



THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE 



"Little girl, how old are you?" 

"Eighteen, sir." 

"Oh, a real bit of impatience. It's 
just about time, of course. What 
might your name be?" 

"Mary." 

"Charming! And so unusual. 
Well now, Mary, may I say that I 
understand your problem — under? 
stand it thoroughly?" 

Mrs. Cuberle smiled and 
smoothed the sequins on her blouse. 

"Madam, you have no idea how 
many there are these days. Sometimes it preys on their minds so that 
it affects them physically, even mentally. Makes them act strange, say 
peculiar, unexpected things. One 
: little girl I recall was so distraught 
she did nothing but brood all day 
long. Can you imagine!" 

"That's what Mary does. When 
she finally told me, doctor, I 
thought she had gone — you know." 

"That bad, eh? Afraid we'll have 
to "start a re-education program, 
very soon, or they'll all be like this. 
I believe I'll suggest it to the senator 
day after tomorrow. 7 

"I don't quite understand, doctor." 

"Simply, Mrs. Cuberle, that the 
children have got to be thoroughly 
instructed. Thoroughly. Too much 
is taken for granted and childish 
minds somehow refuse to accept 
things without definite reason. Children have become far too intellectual, which, as I trust I. needn't remind you, is a dangerous thing." 

"Yes, but what has this to do 
with-^" 

"With Mary? Everything, of 
course. Mary, like half the sixteen, 
seventeen and eighteen year olds today, has begun to feel acutely self


conscious. She feels that her body 
has developed sufficiently for the 
Transformation — which of course it 
has not, not quite yet — and she cannot understand the complex reasons 
that compel her to wait until some 
future date. Mary looks at you, at 
the women all about her, at the pictures, and then she looks into a mirror. From pure perfection of body, 
face, limbs, pigmentation, carriage, 
stance, from simon-pure perfection, 
if I may be allowed the expression, 
she sees herself and is horrified. Isn't 
that so, my dear child? Of course — 
of course. She asks herself, why must 
I be hideous, unbalanced, oversize, 
undersize, full of revolting skin 
eruptions, badly schemed organically? In short, Mary is tired of being 
a monster and is overly anxious to 
achieve what almost everyone else 
has already achieved." 

"But—" said Mrs. Cuberle. 

"This much you understand, 
doubtless. Now, Mary, what you 
object to is that our society offers 
you, and the others like you, no convincing logic on the side of waiting 
until age nineteen. It is all taken for 
granted, and you want to know 
why! It is that simple. A non-technical explanation will not suffice — 
mercy no! The modern child wants 
facts, solid technical data, to satisfy 
her every question. And that, as you 
can both see, will take a good deal 
of reorganizing." 

"But—" said Mary. 

"The child is upset, nervous, 
tense; she acts strange, peculiar, 
odd, worries you and makes herself 
ill because it is beyond our meagre 
powers to put it across. I tell you, 
what we need is a whole new basis 
for learning. And, that will take 



8 



CHARLES BEAUMONT 



doing. It will take doing, Mrs. Cuberle. Now, don't you worry about 
Mary, and don't you worry, child. 
I'll prescribe some pills and — " 

"No, no, doctor ! You're all mixed 
up," cried Mrs. Cuberle. 

"I beg your pardon, Madam?" 

"What I mean is, you've got it 
wrong. Tell him, Mary, tell the doctor what you told me." 

Mary shifted uneasily in the 
chair. 

"It's that— I don't want it." 

The doctor's well-proportioned 
jaw dropped. 

"Would you please repeat that?" 

"I said, I don't want the Transformation." 

"D— Don'f want it?" 

"You see? She told me. That's 
why I came to you." 

The doctor looked at Mary suspiciously. 

"But that's impossible! I have 
never heard of such a thing. Little 
girl, you are playing a joke!" 

Mary nodded negatively. 

"See, doctor. What can it be?" 
Mrs. Cuberle rose and began to 
pace. 



THE DOCTOR clucked his 
tongue and took from a small 
cupboard a black box covered with 
buttons and dials and wire. 

"Oh no, you don't think — I 
mean, could it?" 

"We shall soon see." The doctor 
revolved a number of dials and 
studied the single bulb in the center 
of the box. It did not nicker. He 
removed handles from Mary's head. 

"Dear me," the doctor said, "dear 
me. Your daughter is perfectly sane, 
Mrs. Cuberle." 



"Well, then what is it?" 

"Perhaps she is lying. We haven't 
completely eliminated that factor as 
yet; it slips into certain organisms." 

More tests. More machines and 
more negative results. 

Mary pushed her foot in a circle 
on the floor. When the doctor put 
his hands to her shoulders, she 
looked up pleasantly. 

"Little girl," said the handsome 
man, "do you actually mean to tell 
us that you prefer that body?" 

"Yes sir." 

"May I ask why." 

"I like it. It's — hard to explain, 
but it's me and that's what I like. 
Not the looks, maybe, but the me." 

"You can look in the mirror and 
see yourself, then look at — well, at 
your mother and be content?" 

"Yes, sir." Mary thought of her 
reasons; fuzzy, vague, but very 
definitely there. Maybe she had said 
the reason. No. Only a part of it. 

"Mrs. Cuberle," the doctor said, 
"I suggest that your husband have 
a long talk with Mary." 

"My husband is dead. That affair 
near Ganymede, I believe. Something like that." - A 

"Oh, splendid. Rocket man, eh? 
Very interesting organisms. Something always seems to happen to 
rocket men, in one way or another. 
But — I suppose we should do something." The doctor scratched his 
jaw. "When did she first start talking this way," he asked. 

"Oh, for quite some time. I used 
to think it was because she was such 
a baby. But lately, the time getting 
so close and all, I thought I'd better see you." 
"Of course, yes, very wise. Er — 
does she. also do odd things?" 



THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE 



"Well, I found her on the second 
level one night. She was lying on the 
floor and when I asked her what she 
was doing, she said she was trying to 
sleep." 

Mary flinched. She was sorry, in 
a way, that Mother had found that 
out. 

"To — did you say 'sleep'?" 

"That's right." 

"Now where could she have 
picked that up?" 

"No idea." 

"Mary, don't you know that nobody sleeps anymore? That we have 
an infinitely greater life-span than 
our poor ancestors now that the 
wasteful state of unconsciousness 
has been conquered? Child, have 
you actually slept? No one knows 
how anymore." 

"No sir, but I almost did." 

The doctor sighed. "But, it's unheard of! How could you begin to 
try to do something people have forgotten entirely about?" 

"The way it was described in the 
book, it sounded nice, that's all." 
Mary Was feeling very uncomfortable now. Home and no talking 
man in a foolish white gown . . . 

"Book, book? Are there books at 
your Unit, Madam?" 

"There could be — I haven't 
cleaned up in a while." 

"That is certainly peculiar. I 
haven't seen a book for years. Not 
since '17." 

Mary began to fidget and stare 
nervously about. 

"But with the tapes, why should 
you try and read books — where did 
you get them?" 

"Daddy did. He got them from 
his father and so did Grandpa. He 
said they're better than the tapes 



and he was right." 

Mrs. Cuberle flushed. 

"My husband was a little strange, 
Doctor Hortel. He kept those things 
despite everything I said. 

"Dear me, I — excuse me." 

The muscular, black-haired doctor walked to another cabinet and 
selected from the shelf a bottle. 
From the bottle he took two large 
pills and swallowed them. 

"Sleep — books — doesn't want the 
Transformation — Mrs. Cuberle, my 
dear good woman, this is grave. 
Doesn't want the Transformation. 
I would appreciate it if you would 
change psychiatrists : I am very busy 
and, uh, this is somewhat specialized. I suggest Centraldome. Many 
fine doctors there. Goodbye." 

The doctor turned and sat down 
in a large chair and folded his 
hands. Mary watched him and wondered why the simple statements 
should have so changed things. But 
the doctor did not move from the 
chair. 

"Well!" said Mrs. Cuberle and 
walked quickly from the room. 

The man's iegs were being blown 
off again as they left the reception 



MARY considered the reflection 
in the mirrored wall. She sat 
on the floor and looked at different 
angles of herself: profile, full-face, 
full length, naked, clothed. Then 
she took up the magazine and 
studied it. She sighed. 

"Mirror, mirror on the wall — " 
The words came haltingly to her 
mind and from her lips. She hadn't 
read them, she recalled. Daddy had 
said them, quoted them as he put it. 



10 

But they too were lines from a book 
— "who is the fairest of—" 

A picture of Mother sat upon the 
dresser and Mary considered this 
now. Looked for a long time at the 
slender, feminine neck. The golden 
skin, smooth and without blemish, 
without wrinkles and without age. 
The dark brown eyes and the thin 
tapers of eyebrows, the long black 
lashes, set evenly, so that each half 
of the face corresponded precisely. 
The half -parted- mouth, a violet tint 
against the gold, the white, white 
teeth, even, sparkling. 

Mother. Beautiful, Transformed 
Mother. And back again to the mirror. 

"— of them all . .. ." 

The image of a rather chubby 
girl, without lines of rhythm or 
grace, without perfection. Splotchy 
skin full of little holes, puffs in the 
cheeks, red eruptions on the forehead. Perspiration, shapeless Hair 
flowing onto shapeless shoulders 
down a shapeless body. Like all of 
them, before the Transformation. 

Did they all look like this, before? 
Did Mother, even? 

Mary thought hard, trying to remember exactly what Daddy and 
Grandpa had said, why they said the 
Transformation was a bad thing, 
and why she believed and agreed 
with them so strongly. It made little 
sense, but they were right. They 
were right! And one day, she would 
understand completely. 

Mrs. Cuberle slammed the door 
angrily and Mary jumped to her 
feet. She hadn't forgotten about it. 
"The way you upset Dr. Hortel. " 
He won't even see me anymore, and 
these traumas are getting horrible. 
I'll have to get that awful Dr. 



CHARLES BEAUMONT 

Wagoner." 

"Sorry—" 

Mrs. Cuberle sat on the couch 
and crossed her legs carefully. 

"What in the world were you 
doing on the floor?" 

"Trying to sleep." 

"Now, I won't hear of it! You've 
got to stop it! You know you're not 
insane. Why should you want to do 
such a silly thing?" 

"The books. And Daddy told me 
about it." 

"And you mustn't read those terrible things." 

"Why — is there a law against 
them?" 

"Well, no, but people tired of 
books when the tapes came in. You 
know that. The house is full of 
tapes; anything you want." 

Mary stuck out her lower lip. 

"They're no fun. All about the 
Wars and the colonizations." 

"And I suppose books are fun?" 

"Yes. They are." 

"And that's where you got this 
idiotic notion that you don't want 
the Transformation, isn't it? Of 
course it is. Well, we'll see to that!" 



MRS. CUBERLE rose quickly 
and took the books from the 
corner and from the closet and filled 
her arms with them. She looked 
everywhere in the room and 
gathered the old rotten volumes. 

These she carried from the room 
and threw into the elevator. A button guided the doors shut. 

"I thought you'd do that," Mary 
said. "That's why I hid most of 
the good ones. Where you'll never 
find them." 

Mrs. Cuberle put a satin hand


THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE 



11 



kerchief to her eyes and began to 
weep. 

"Just look at you. Look. I don't' 
know what I ever did to deserve 
this!" 

"Deserve what, Mother? What 
am I doing that's so wrong?" Mary's 
mind rippled in a confused stream. 

"What!" Mrs. Cuberle screamed, 
"What! Do you think I want people 
to point to you and say I'm the 
mother of an idiot? That's what 
they'll say, you'll see. Or," she 
looked up hopefully, "have you 
changed your mind?" 

"No." The vague reasons, longing to be put into words. 

"It doesn't hurt. They just take 
off a little skin and put some on and 
give you pills and electronic treatments and things like that. It 
doesn't take more than a week." 

"No." The reason. 

"Don't you want to be beautiful, 
like other people — like me? Look 
at your friend Shala, she's getting 
her Transformation next month. 
And she's almost pretty now." 

"Mother, I don't care — " 

"If it's the bones you,'re worried 
about, well, that doesn't hurt. They 
give you a shot and when you wake 
up, everything's moulded right. 
Everything, to suit the personality." ' 

"I don't care, I don't care." 

"But why?" 

"I like me the way I am." Almost 
— almost exactly. But not quite. 
Part of it, however. Part of what 
Daddy and Grandpa meant. 

"But you're so ugly, dear! Like 
Dr. Hortel said. "And Mr. Willmes, 
at the factory. He told some people 
he thought you were the ugliest girl 
he'd ever seen. Says he'll be thankful when you have your Transfor


mation. And what if he hears of all 
this, what'll happen then?" 

"Daddy said I was beautiful." 

"Well really, dear. You do have 
eyes." 

"Daddy said that real beauty is 
only skin deep. He said a lot of 
things like that and when I read 
the books I felt the same way. I 
guess I don't want to look like 
everybody else, that's all." No, that's 
not it. Not at all it. 

"That man had too much to do 
with you. You'll notice that he had 
his Transformation, though!" 

"But he was sorry. He told me 
that if he had it to do over again, 
he'd never do it. He said for me to 
be stronger than he was." 

"Well, I won't have it. You're 
not going to get away with this, 
young lady. After all, I am your 
mother." 

A bulb flickered in the bathroom 
and Mrs. Cuberle walked uncertainly to the cabinet. She took out a 
little cardboard box. 

"Time for lunch." 

Mary nodded. That was another 
thing the books talked about, which 
the tapes did not. Lunch seemed to 
be something special long ago, or 
at least different. The books talked 
of strange ways of putting a load of 
things into the mouth and chewing these things. Enjoying them. 
Strange and somehow wonderful. 

"And you'd better get ready for 
work." 

"Yes, Mother." 



THE office was quiet and without 
shadows. The walls gave off a 
steady luminescence, distributed the 
light evenly upon all the desks and 



12 



CHARLES BEAUMONT 



tables. And it was neither hot nor 
cold. 

Mary held the ruler firmly and 
allowed the pen to travel down the 
metal edge effortlessly. The new 
black lines were small and accurate. 
She tipped her head, compared the 
notes beside her to the plan she was 
working on. She noticed the beautiful people looking at her more furtively than before, and she wondered about this as she made her 
lines. 

A tall man rose from his desk in 
the rear of the office and walked 
down the aisle to Mary's table. He 
surveyed her work, allowing his eyes 
to travel cautiously from her face 
to the draft. 

Mary looked around. 

"Nice job," said the man. 

"Thank you, Mr. Willmes." 

"Dralich shouldn't have anything 
to complain about. That crane 
should hold the whole damn city." 

"It's, very good alloy, sir." 

"Yeah. Say, kid, you got a minute?" 

"Yes sir." 

"Let's go into Mullinson's office." 

The big handsome man led the 
way into a small cubby-hole of a 
room. He motioned to a chair and 
sat on the edge of one desk. 

"Kid, I never was one to beat 
around the bush. Somebody called 
in little while ago, gave me some 
crazy story about you not wanting 
the Transformation.". 

Mary said "Oh." Daddy had said 
it would have to happen, some day. 
This must be what he meant. 

"I would've told them they were 
way off the beam, but I wanted to 
talk to you first, get it straight." 

"Well, sir, it's true. I don't. I 



want to stay this way." 

The man looked at Mary and 
then coughed, embarrassedly. 

"What the hell- — excuse me, kid, 
but — I don't exactly get it. You, uh, 
you saw the psychiatrist?" 

"Yes sir. I'm not insane. Dr. 
Hortel can tell you." 

"I didn't mean anything like 
that. Well — " the man laughed 
nervously. "I don't know what to 
say. You're still a cub, but you do 
swell work. Lot of good results, lots 
of comments from the stations. But, 
Mr. Poole won't like it." 

"I know. I know what you mean, 
Mr. Willmes. But nothing can 
change my mind. I want to stay this 
way and that's all there is to it." 

"But — you'll get old before you're 
half through life." 

Yes, she would. Old, like the 
Elders, wrinkled and brittle, unable 
to move right. Old. "It's hard to 
make you understand. But I don't 
see why it should make any difference." 

"Don't go getting me wrong, 
now. It's not me, but, you know, I 
don't own Interplan. I just work 
here. Mr. Poole likes things running 
smooth and it's my job to carry it 
out. And soon as everybody finds 
out, things wouldn't run smooth. 
There'll be a big stink. The dames 
will start asking questions and talk." 

"Will you accept my resignation, 
then, Mr. Willmes?" 

"Sure you won't change your 
mind?" 

"No sir. I decided that a long 
time ago. And I'm sorry now that 
I told Mother or anyone else. No 
sir, I won't change my mind." 

"Well, I'm sorry, Mary. You been 
doing awful swell work. Couple of 



THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE

years you could be centralled on 
one of the asteroids, the way you 
been working. But if you should 
change your mind, there'll always be 
a job for you here." 

"Thank you, sir." 

"No hard feelings?" 

"No hard feelings." 

"Okay then. You've got till 
March. And between you and me, I 
hope by then you've decided the 
other way." 

Mary walked back down the aisle, 
past the rows of desks. Past the men 
and women. The handsome, model 
men and the beautiful, perfect 
women, perfect, all perfect, all 
looking alike. Looking exactly alike. 

She sat down again and took up 
her ruler and pen. 



MARY stepped into the elevator 
and descended several hundred feet. At the Second Level she 
pressed a button and the elevator 
stopped. The doors opened with another button and the doors to her 
Unit with still another. 

Mrs. Cuberle sat on the floor by 
the T-V, disconsolate and red-eyed. 
Her blond han- had come slightly 
askew and a few strands hung over 
her forehead. "You don't need to 
tell me. No one will hire you." 

Mary sat beside her mother. "If 
you only hadn't told Mr. Willmes in 
the first place — " 

"Well, I thought he could beat a 
little sense into you." 

The sounds from the T-V grew 
louder. Mrs. Cuberle changed channels and finally turned it off. ■ 

"What did you do today, Mother?" Mary smiled. 

"Do? What can I do, now? No


body will even come over! I told 
you what would happen." 

"Mother!" 

"They say you should be in the 
Circuses." 

Mary went into another room. 
Mrs. Cuberle followed. "How are 
we going to live? Where' does the 
money come from now? Just because you're stubborn on this crazy 
idea. Crazy crazy crazy! Can I support both of us? They'll be firing 
me, next!" 

"Why is this happening?" 

"Because of you, that's why. Nobody else on this planet has ever 
refused the Transformation. But 
you turn it down. You want to be 
ugly!" 

Mary put her arms about her 
mother's shoulders. "I wish I could 
explain, I've tried so hard to. It isn't 
that I want to bother anyone, or 
that Daddy wanted me to. I just 
don't want the Transformation." 

Mrs. Cuberle reached into the 
pockets of her blouse and got a 
purple pill. She swallowed the pill. 
When the letter dropped from the 
chute, Mrs. Cuberle ran to snatch 
it up. She read it once, silently, then 
smiled. 

"Oh, I was afraid they wouldn't 
answer. But we'll see about this 
now!" 

She gave the letter to Mary. 

Mrs. Zena Cuberle 

Unit 451 D 

Levels II & III 

City 

Dear Madam: 

In re your letter of Dec 3 36. We 
have carefully examined your complaint and consider that it requires 
stringent measures. Quite frankly, 



14 



CHARLES BEAUMONT 



the possibility of such a complaint 
has never occurred to this Dept. 
and we therefore cannot make positive directives at the moment. 

However, due to the unusual 
qualities of the matter, we have arranged an audience at Centraldome, Eighth Level, Sixteenth 
Unit, Jan 3 37, 23 sharp. Dr. Elph 
Hortel has been instructed to attend. You will bring the subject in 
question. 

Yrs, 

DEPT F 

Mary let the paper flutter to the 
floor. She walked quietly to the elevator and set it for Level III. When 
the elevator stopped, she ran from 
it, crying, into her room. 

She thought and remembered 
and tried to sort out and put together. Daddy had said it, Grandpa 
had, the books did. Yes, the books 
did. 

She read until her eyes burned 
and her eyes burned until she could 
read no more. Then Mary went to 
sleep, softly and without realizing 
it, for the first time. 

But the sleep was not peaceful. 



LADIES and gentlemen," said 
the young-looking, well groomed 
man, "this problem does not resolve 
easily. Dr. Hortel here, testifies that 
Mary Cuberle is definitely not insane. Drs. Monagh, Prinn and Fedders all verify this judgment. Dr. 
Prinn asserts that the human organism is no longer so constructed as 
to create and, sustain such an attitude through deliberate falsehood. 
Further, there is positively nothing 
in the structure, of Mary Cuberle 



which might suggest difficulties in 
Transformation. There is evidence 
for all these statements. And yet we 
are faced with this refusal. What, 
may I ask, is to be done?" 

Mary looked at a metal table. 

"We have been in session far too 
long, holding up far too many other 
pressing contingencies. The trouble 
on Mercury, for example. We'll 
have to straighten that out, somehow." 

Throughout the rows of beautiful 
people, the mumbling increased. 
Mrs. Cuberle sat nervously, tapping 
her shoe and running a comb 
through her hair. 

"Mary Cuberle, you have been 
given innumerable chances to reconsider, you know." 

Mary said, "I know. But I don't 
want to." 

The beautiful people looked at 
Mary and laughed. Some shook 
their heads. 

The man threw up his hands. 
"Little girl, can you realize what an 
issue you have caused? The unrest, 
the wasted time? Do you fully iftiderstand what you have done? Intergalactic questions hang fire while 
you sit there saying the same thing 
over and over. Doesn't the happiness of your Mother mean anything 
to you?" 

A slender, supple woman in a 
back row cried, "We want action. 
Do something!" 

The man in the high stool raised 
■his hand. "None of that, now. We 
must conform, even though the 
question is out of the ordinary." He 
leafed through a number of papers 
on his desk, leaned down and whispered into the ear of a strong blond 
man. Then he turned to Mary 



THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE 



15 



again. "Child, for the last time. Do 
you reconsider? Will you accept the 
Transformation?" 

"No." 

The man shrugged his shoulders. 
"Very well, then. I have here a petition, signed by two thousand individuals and representing all the 
Stations of Earth. They have been 
made aware of all the facts and 
have submitted the petition voluntarily. It's all so unusual and I'd 
hoped we wouldn't have to — but 
the petition urges drastic measures." 

The mumbling rose. 

"The petition urges that you 
shall, upon final refusal, be forced 
by law to accept the Transformation. And that an act of legislature 
shall make this universal and binding in the future." 

Mary's eyes were open, wide. She 
stood and paused before speaking. 

"Why?" she asked, loudly. 

The man passed a hand through 
his hair. 

Another voice from the crowd, 
"Seems to be a lot of questions unanswered here." 

And another, "Sign the petition, 
Senator!" , 

All the voices, "Sign it, sign it!" 

"But why?" Mary began to cry. 
The voices stilled for a moment. 

"Because — Because—" 

"If you'd only tell me that. Tell 
me!" 

"Why, it simply isn't being done, 
that's all. The greatest gift of all. 
and what if others should get the 
same idea? What would happen ^to 
us then, little girl? We'd be right 
back to the ugly, thin, fat, unhealthy-looking race we were ages 
ago! There can't be any exceptions." 



"Maybe they didn't consider 
themselves so ugly." 

The mumbling began anew. 

"That isn't the point," cried the 
man. "You must conform!" 

And the voices cried "Yes" loudly 
until the man took up a pen and 
signed the papers on his desk. 

Cheers, applause, shouts. 

Mrs. Cuberle patted Mary on the 
top of her head. 

"There, now!" she said, happily, 
"Everything will be all right now. 
You'll see, Mary." 



THE Transformation Parlor covered the entire Level, sprawling 
with its departments. It was always 
filled and there was nothing to sign 
and no money to pay and people 
were always waiting in line. 

But today the people stood aside. 
And there were still more, looking 
in through doors, TV cameras 
placed throughout the tape machines in every corner. It was filled, 
but not bustling as usual. 

Mary walked past the people, 
Mother and the men in back of her, 
following. She looked at the people. 
The people were beautiful, perfect, 
without a single flaw. 

All the beautiful people. AH the 
ugly people, staring out from bodies 
that were not theirs. Walking on 
legs that had been made for them, 
laughing with manufactured voices, 
gesturing with shaped and fashioned arms. 

Mary walked slowly, despite the 
prodding. In her eyes, in her eyes, 
was a mounting confusion ; a wide, 
wide wonderment. 

The reason was becoming less 
vague; the fuzzed edges were falling 



16 



CHARLES BEAUMONT 



away now. Through all the horrible 
months and all the horrible moments, the edges fell away. Now 
it was almost clear. 

She looked down at her own 
body, then at the walls which reflected it. Flesh of her flesh, bone of 
her bone, all hers, made by no one, 
built by herself or someone she did 
not know. Uneven kneecaps, making two grinning cherubs when they 
bent, and the old familiar rubbing 
together of fat inner thighs. Fat, unshapely, unsystematic Mary. But 
Mary. 

Of course. Of course! This was 
what Daddy meant, what Grandpa 
and the books meant. What they 
would know if they would read the 
books or 'hear the words, the good, 
reasonable words, the words that 
signified more, much more, than 
any of this. 

The understanding heaped up 
with each step. 

"Where are these people?" Mary 
asked half to herself. "What has 
happened to them and don't they 
miss themselves, these manufactured things?" 

She stopped, suddenly. 

"Yes! That is the reason. They 
have all forgotten themselves!" 

A curvacious woman stepped forward and took Mary's hand. The 
woman's skin was tinted dark. 
Chipped and sculptured bone into 
slender rhythmic lines, electrically 
created carriage, stance, made, 
turned out. 

"All right, young lady. We will 
begin." 

They guided Mary to a large, 
curved leather seat. 

From the top of a long silver pole 
a machine lowered itself. Tiny bulbs 



glowed to life and cells began to 
click. The people stared. Slowly a 
picture formed upon the screen in 
the machine. Bulbs directed at 
Mary, then redirected into the 
machine. Wheels turning, buttons 
ticking. 

The picture was completed. 

"Would you like to see it?" 

Mary closed her eyes, tight. 

"It's really very nice." The woman turned to the crowd. "Oh yes, 
there's a great deal to be salvaged; 
you'd be surprised. A great deal. 
We'll keep the nose and I don't believe the elbows will have to be altered at all.',' 

Mrs. Cuberle looked at Mary and 
smiled. "Now, it isn't so bad as you 
thought, is it?" she-said. 

The beautiful people looked. 
Cameras turned, tapes wound. 

"You'll have to excuse us now. 
Only the machines allowed." 

Only the machines. 

The people filed out. 

Mary saw the rooms in the mirror. Saw things in the rooms, the 
faces and bodies that had been left; 
the woman and the machines and 
the old young men standing about, 
adjusting, readying. 

Then she looked at the picture in 
the screen. 

And screamed. 

A woman of medium height 
stared back at her. A woman with a 
curved body and thin legs; silver 
hair, pompadoured, cut short; full 
sensuous lips, small breasts, flat 
stomach, unblemished skin. 

A strange, strange woman no one 
had ever seen before. 

The nurse began to take Mary's 
clothes off. 

"Geoff," the woman said, "come 



THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE 



17 



look at this, will you. Not one so bad 
in years. Amazing that we can keep 
anything at all." 

The handsome man put his hands 
in his pockets. 

"Pretty bad, all right." 

"Be still, child, stop making those 
noises. You know perfectly well 
nothing is going to hurt." 

"But — what will you do with 
me?" 

"That was all explained to you." 

"No, no, with me, me!" 

"Oh, you mean the castoffs. The 
usual. I don't know exactly. Somebody takes care of it." 

"I want me!" Mary cried. "Not 
that!" She pointed at the screen. 



HER chair was wheeled into a 
semi-dark room. She was naked 
now, and the men lifted her to a 
table. The surface was like glass, 



black, filmed. A big machine hung 
above. 

Straps. Clamps pulling, stretching limbs apart. The screen with the 
picture brought in. The men and 
the woman, more women now. Dr. 
Hortel in a corner, sitting with his 
legs crossed, shaking his head. 

Mary began to cry above the hum 
of the mechanical things. 

"Shhh. My gracious, such a 
racket! Just think about your job 
waiting for you, and all the friends 
you'll have and how nice everything 
will be. No more trouble now." 

The big machine hurtling downward. 

"Where will I find me?" Mary 
screamed, "when it's all over?" 

A long needle slid into rough flesh 
and the beautiful people gathered 
around the table. 

They turned on the big machine. 



THE END 




It was getting so a person couldn't sleep nights anymore.

Would you like to see all hell break loose? 
Just make a few holes in nothing at all — push 
some steel beams through the holes — and then 
head for the hills. But first, read what happened to some people who really did it. 



UMLH 




INCORPORATED 



By L. Major Reynolds 



THE red headed secretary asked, 
"Names, please?" 

"Ted Baker." 

"Bill Stephens." 

"To see H. Joshua Blair. We 
have an appointment." 

"It's for three-thirty. We called 
up two weeks ago." 

The secretary said, "Oh yes. I 
have you on the list." She checked 
them off, studied them vaguely, 
asked, "What was it you wanted to 
see Mr. Blair about?" , 

Ted Baker held out the small 
steel box he was carrying. "About 
this." 

"Ah— what is it?" 

"It's a box." 

"I can see that," the red head 
snapped. "What is it for? What 



does it do?" 

"It's for construction work. It 
makes holes." 

The girl sighed. It was late in the 
day and she didn't care much, really. She snapped an intercom button. An inquiring voice rasped at 
her. She said, "A.Mr. Baker and a 
Mr. Stephens to see you." 

Evidently it was all right because 
she snapped off the button and 
pointed to a door. "In there." 

They went in the door and faced 
a desk large enough to play tennis 
on. The man behind the desk gave 
them a cordial snarl. "Well, what 
have you got on your mind? And 
don't take all day to tell me." 

Ted extended the box. "This. 
We'd like to sell it to you." 



19

L MAJOR REYNOLDS 



"What is it? A bomb?" 

"No sir. It makes holes. It makes 
holes real quick." 

Blair scowled at the box. "What 
the hell do I want of holes?" 

Bill Stephens came forward with 
further explanation. "You see, sir, 
Ted and I are inventors we make, 
well — things. We've been working 
on this invention in our basement 
and it seems to be a success." 

"We don't quite know why it's a 
success," Ted said, "but it is." 

"We'd like to demonstrate it for 
you." 

"Well, go ahead and demonstrate." 

Ted raised the box and aimed it 
horizontally at nothing in particular. He pressed a black button. 
There was an odd whirring noise. 
He took his hand off the button and 
lowered the box. 

"What are you waiting for?" 
Blair growled. 

"Nothing. That's it. I've made 
the hole." 

"Are you two crazy? What kind 
of a fool trick — ?" 

Ted reached down and took a 
pencil off the desk. "May I borrow 
this?" Without waiting for permission, he put the pencil carefully into 
the place he'd pointed the box. Half 
the pencil disappeared. He took his 
hand away. The part of the pencil 
still in sight didn't come with it. It 
stayed where it was, lying in thin 
air, horizontally, with no apparent 
support. 

H. Joshua Blair goggled and 
turned three shades whiter. "Whawha-what the hell!" 

"And now, if you'll try to move 
the pencil, the demonstration will 
be complete." 



LIKE a man in a trance, Blair 
got up from his desk and 
grasped the pencil. It wouldn't 
move. He got red in the face and 
threw all his weight on it. It would 
neither pull nor push. It stayed 
where it was. Finally Blair backed 
away from the thing. He leaned on 
his desk and panted. 

"You see," Ted said, "The hole 
goes into the fourth dimension. 
There's no other explanation. And 
the fourth dimension holds solider 
than concrete." 

Old Blair's head was < spinning, 
but business instinct came quickly 
to his rescue. "What happens," he 
asked, "if something in the third 
dimension is in the way?" 

"It gets out of the way," Bill said. 

Ted demonstrated. He trained 
the box on the visible remains of the 
pencil. It vanished. 

Blair said, "Well I'll be damned!" 

"We figure this will save you a lot 
of money in construction work," 
Bill said. "You can get along" without riveters. You just have a man 
put holes in girders with this and 
push the rivets through. You also 
make holes for the beam-ends, andyour entire building will be anchored in the fourth dimension." 

"Do it again," Blair said. 

Ted made another hole and put 
another pencil into it. Blair grasped 
the pencil and applied leverage. 
The pencil snapped at the point it 
entered the next dimension but the 
broken end of the far piece was not 
to be seen. 

Blair asked, "You say you two 
invented this gadget?" 

"That's right," Bill said. "We've 
got a workshop in my basement. We 
invent in the evenings after we 



HOLES, INCORPORATED 



21 



come home from work." 
"What do you work at?" 
"I read gas meters. He's a clerk 

in a supermart." 

"I suppose you want money for 

this thing." 

"We'd like to sell it, yes sir." 
"How much do you want for it?" 
"Well, we don't know. What's it 

worth to you?" 

"Nothing probably. Leave it here 

a few days. I'll look it over and let 

you know." 
"But—" 
"And don't call me — I'll call 

you." 
"But—" 
"Leave your address and phone 

number with my secretary." 

After Ted and Bill left, Blair 

yelled, "Get me Jake Steadman in 

the engineering department!" He 

didn't bother using the intercom, 

but his secretary heard him anyhow. 

Ted and Bill went to work on an 
idea they had for the treatment of 
leather. You dipped your shoes in a 
solution and they lasted forever. 
The thing didn't work too well, 
however. It was full of bugs. They 
tried to eliminate the bugs and once 
in a while they thought of H. 
Joshua Blair. 

"Don't you think it's about time 
he called us?" Ted asked. 
* "Don't be so impatient. He's a 
big man. He owns a big company. 
It takes time." 

"He's had over a month." 

"Relax. We'll hear from him." 



ANOTHER week passed, and 
another, until one evening 
Ted came galloping into the work


shop with news. "That big new addition to the city hall! They're 
working on it! H. Joshua Blair Construction Company. A big sign says 
so!" 

"Relax. You'll blow a tube." 

"Relax hell! He's using our invention to put up the steel girders. 
Just like we suggested to him. Guys 
with boxes like ours making holes 
and putting in rivets!" 

Bill stopped what he was doing. 
"He said he'd call us. Maybe he forgot. Maybe we better go see him." 

They both knocked off work the 
next day and got to Blair's office at 
nine o'clock. The. red headed 
secretary said, "You'll have to make 
an appointment." 

"Appointment hell!" Ted headed 
for the inner door. Bill followed 
him. They went into H. Joshua 
Blair's office to find him in conference with two vice-presidents. 
Ted said, "Mr. Blair, we came—" 

"Who in the devil are you?" 

"You remember us. Ted Baker 
and Bill Stephens. We came about 
our invention." 

"What invention?" 

"Our hole maker. You're using it 
on the city hall addition." 

Blair glowered. "Where'd y^ou get 
the idea it was yours? Have you got 
any patents to show?" 

"Well, no. We didn't—" 

"I did! Fourteen good solid 
patents. You two better go peddle 
your groceries." 

"Now look, Mr. Blair." 

Blair raised his voice. "Throw 
these two bums out!" 

Three huskies appeared as by 
magic to do Blair's bidding. As Ted 
and Bill landed on the sidewalk, one 
of the vice-presidents said, "Do you 



22 



L. MAJOR REYNOLDS 



think that was smart, H. J.? They 
might cause trouble." 

Blair snorted. "They haven't got 
a prayer. A meter reader and a 
grocery clerk!" 

"We could have at least given 
them a few hundred.'' 

"Not on your life. Never give a 
sucker an even break, Jim. Give 
them anything at all, we acknowledge their claim. That'd be stupid." 

"Maybe your right." 

"Of course I'm right. It's, business. Now about those other bids. By 
gad ! We can run every contractor 1 in 
town out of competition! They 
can't touch our prices!" 

Out on the sidewalk, Bill and Ted 
sat mournfully looking up at the 
vast steel skeleton, held together 
literally by their own genius. Ted 
said, "We got a raw deal." 

"Maybe we had it coming. We 
were pretty stupid." 

"Anything we can do?" 

"Doesn't look like it." 

"Maybe the leather solution will 
turn out." 

"Maybe." Bill looked wistfully up 
at the steel skeleton. "At even a cent 
a hole, we'd have done all right." 

"Let's go home and get to work." 

In the Mighty and Benevolent 
Kingdom of Szkazia, a minor reign 
of terror existed. The King, tired of 
complaints from his subjects, had 
just finished dressing down his 
Prime Minister. The "Prime Minister was passing the abuse on to his 
Chief Scientist. "If something isn't 
done soon, I won't be responsible 
for your head, my friend. The King 
is in a rage." 

The eyes of the Chief Scientist 
watered — partly from fear, and 



partly from nights and days spent 
in his laboratory beating out his 
brains on one idea after another. 

"I'm doing my best, sire — " 

"It's not good enough! These 
steel girders coming out of nowhere! Banging people in the head 
—whacking them in the stomach! 
Why it isn't safe to walk through the 
halls of the Administration Building. Even the bedrooms of the Executive Apartments are not safe! The 
other night the Director of Propaganda had just gone to bed — " 

"I know of the incident," the 
Chief Scientist said hurriedly. 

"Oh, you do? But you've done 
nothing about- — " 

"I've been working hard," the 
scientist said patiently, "and I think 
I have the solution. Give me another day." 

"One day, then. After that — " 
The Prime Minister made a significant slicing motion with his finger. 



THE Prime Minister chewed his 
fingernails and watched the 
clock. Sleep was out of the question 
with the King calling up every little 
while yelling for action. The 
Minister counted the hours and 
presented himself at the Royal 
Laboratories precisely twenty-four 
hours later. "Time's up," he 
snapped. 

The Chief Scientist was wiping 
his i£ce. There were new lines 
around his mouth. He indicated a 
small steel box. "I think I've got it," 
he said. "Come with me." 

They went swiftly to the Administration Building. "This should be 
close enough. We depress this lever 
and — and hope." 



HOLES, INCORPORATED 



23 



"Well, doit— doit!" 

The Chief Scientist pushed the 
lever on the steel box. A whirring 
sound came from within. All the 
steel girder ends in sight — all the 
nasty little rivets — disappeared. 
The Chief Scientist smiled and 
wiped his face again. "It worked/' 
he said. 

"Excellent. I'll see that you get a 
medal." 

"Thank you," the Chief Scientist 
said sadly. That was the trouble 
with people nowadays. They either 
handed you a medal or your head. 



TED and Bill stared sadly at 
the mess around the City Hall. 
Bill said, "It's a good thing it col* 
lapsed at night so nobody was 



killed, isn't it?" 

"You said it. I'd have felt guilty 
if there'd been any casualties." 

"What do you suppose went 
wrong?" 

"You got me. What do you think 
they'll do to old Blair?" 

"I don't know, but it looks pretty 
bad. They refused to let him out on 
bail." 

"Serves him right. The way he 
treated us." 

"You've got it wrong. He treated 
us swell. He did us a big favor. We 
could have been blamed for this." 

Bill thought it over before saying, 
"I guess you're right. I hadn't 
looked at it that way." 

"Let's go home and get to work 
on the leather solution." 

So they did.

Tarn's problem was simple. He lived in 
a world that belonged to someone else. 



MARLEY'S CHAIN 



By Alan E. Nourse 



THEY saw Tarn's shabby clothing and the small, weatherbeaten bag he carried, and they Ordered him aside from the flow of 
passengers, and checked his packet 
of passports and visas with extreme 
care. Then they ordered him to 
wait. Tam waited, a chilly apprehension rising in his throat. For fifteen minutes he watched them, 
helplessly. 

Finally, the Spaceport was 
empty, and the huge liner from the 
outer Asteroid Rings was being 
lifted and rolled by the giant hooks 
and cranes back into its berth for 
drydock and repair, her curved, 
meteor-dented hull gleaming dully 
in the harsh arc lights. Tam 
watched the creaking cranes, and 
shivered in the cold night air, feeling hunger and dread gnawing at 
his stomach. There was none of the 
elation left, none of the great, expansive, soothing joy at returning 
to Earth after eight long years of 



hard work and bitterness. Only the 
cold, corroding uncertainty, the 
growing apprehension. Times had 
changed since that night back in 
'87— just how much he hardly 
dared to guess. All he knew was the 
rumors he had heard, fhe whispered tales, the frightened eyes and 
the scarred backs and faces. Tam 
hadn't believed them then, so remote from Earth. He had just 
laughed and told himself that the 
stories weren't true. And now they 
all welled back into his mind, tightening his throat and making him 
tremble — 

"Hey, Sharkie. Come here." 
Tam turned and walked slowly 
over to the customs official who 
held his papers. "Everything's in 
order," he said, half defiantly, looking up at the officer's impassive 
face. "There isn't any mistake." 

"What were you doing in the 
Rings, Sharkie?" The officer's voice 
was sharp.

"Indenture. Working off my fare 
back home." 

The officer peered into Tarn's 
face, incredulously. "And you come 
back here?" He shook his head and 
turned to the other officer. "I knew 
these Sharkies were dumb, but I 
didn't think they we»e that dumb." 
He turned back to Tam, his eyes 
suspicious. "What do you think 
you're going to do now?" 

Tam shrugged, uneasily. "Get a 
job," he said. "A man's got to eat." 

The officers exchanged glances. 
"How long you been on the 
Rings?" 

"Eight years."' Tam looked up at 
him- anxiously. "Can I have my 
papers now?" 

A cruel grin played over the officer's lips. "Sure," he said, handing back the packet of papers. 
"Happy job-hunting," he added 
sardonically. "But remember — the 
ship's going back to the Rings in a 
week. You can always sign yourself over for fare — " 

"I know," said Tam, turning 
away sharply. "I know all about 
how that works." He tucked the 
papers carefully into a tattered 
breast pocket, hefted the bag 
wearily, and began trudging slowly 
across the cold concrete of the 
Port toward the street and the Underground. A wave of loneliness, 
almost overpowering in intensity, 
swept over him, a feeling of emptiness, bleak and hopeless. A chilly 
night wind swept through his unkempt blond hair as the automatics let him out into the street, and 
he saw the large dirty "New Denver 
Underground" sign with the arrow 
at the far side of the road. Off to 
the right, several miles across the 



high mountain plateau, the great 
capitol city loomed up, shining like 
a thousand twinkling stars in the 
clear cold air. Tam jingled his last 
few coins listlessly, and started for 
the downward ramp. Somewhere, 
down there, he could find a darkened corner, maybe even a bench, 
where the police wouldn't bother 
him for a couple of hours.' Maybe 
after a little sleep, he'd find some 
courage, hidden away somewhere. 
Just enough to walk into an office 
and ask for a job. 

That, he reflected wearily as he 
shuffled into the tunnel, would take 
a lot of courage — 



THE girl at the desk glanced up 
at him, indifferent, and turned 
her eyes back to the letter she was 
typing. Tam Peters continued to 
stand, awkwardly, his blond hair 
rumpled, little crow's-feet of weariness creeping from the corners of 
his eyes. Slowly he looked around 
the neat office, feeling a pang of 
shame at his shabby clothes. He 
should at least have found some 
way to shave, he thought, some way 
to take some of the rumple from his 
trouser legs. He looked back at the 
receptionist, and coughed, lightly. 

She finished her letter at a leisurely pace, and finally looked up 
at him, her eyes cold. "Well?" 

"I read your ad. I'm looking for 
a job. I'd like to speak to Mr. Randall." 

The girl's eyes narrowed, and she 
took him in in a rapid, sweeping 
glance, his high, pale forehead, the 
shock of mud-blond hair, the thin, 
sensitive face with the exaggerated 
lines of approaching middle age, 



MARLEY'S CHAIN 



27 



the slightly misty blue eyes. It 
seemed to Tam that she stared for 
a full minute, and he shifted uneasily, trying to meet the cold inspection, and failing, finally settling 
his eyes on her prim, neatly manicured fingers. Her lip curled very 
slightly. "Mr. Randall can't see you 
today. He's busy. Try again tomorrow." She turned back to typing. 

A flat wave of defeat sprang up 
in his chest. "The ad said to apply 
today. The earlier the better." 

She sniffed indifferently, and 
pulled a long white sheet from the 
desk. "Have you filled out an application?" 

"No." 

"You can't see Mr. Randall 
without filling out an application." 
She pointed to a small table across 
the room, and he felt her eyes on 
his back as he shuffled over and sat 
down. 

He began filling out the application with great care, making the 
printing as neat as he could with 
the old-style vacuum pen provided. 
Name, age, sex, race, nationality, 
planet where born, pre-Revolt experience, post-Revolt experience, 
preference — try as he would, Tam 
couldn't keep the ancient pen from 
leaking, making an unsightly blot 
near the center of the form. Finally 
he finished, and handed the paper 
back to the girl at the desk. Then 
he sat back and waited. 

Another man came in, filled out 
a form, and waited, too, shooting 
Tam a black look across the room. 
In a few moments the girl turned 
to the man. "Robert Stover?" 

"Yuh," said the man, lumbering 
to his feet. "That's me." 

"Mr. Randall will see you now." 



The man walked heavily across 
the room, disappeared into the back 
office. Tam eyed the clock uneasily, 
still waiting. 

A garish picture on the wall 
caught his eyes, a large, very poor 
oil portrait of a very stout, graying 
man dressed in a ridiculous green 
suit with a little white turban-like 
affair on the top of his head. Underneath was a little brass plaque 
with words Tam could barely make 
out: 

Abraham L. Ferrel 
(1947-1986) 

Founder and First President 
Marsport Mines, Incorporated 

"Unto such men as these, 
we look to leadership." 

Tam stared at the picture, his 
lip curling slightly. He glanced 
anxiously at the clock as another 
man was admitted to the small back 
office. 

Then another man. Anger began 
creeping into Tarn's face, and he 
fought to keep the scowl away, to 
keep from showing his concern. 
The hands of the clock crept 
around, then around again. It was 
almost noon. Not a very new 
dodge, Tam thought coldly. Not 
very new at all. Finally the small 
cold flame of anger got the better 
of him, and he rose and walked 
over to the desk. "I'm still here," 
he said patiently. "I'd like to see 
Mr. Randall." 

The girl stared at him indignantly, and flipped an intercom switch. 
"That Peters application is still out 
here," she said brittlely. "Do you 
want to see him, or not?" 



28 



ALAN E. NOURSE 



There was a moment of silence. 
Then the voice on the intercom 
grated, "Yes,»I guess so. Send him 
in." 

The office was smaller, immaculately neat. Two visiphone units 
hung on a switchboard at the man's 
elbow. Tarn's eyes caught the familiar equipment, recognized the 
interplanetary power coils on one. 
Then he turned his eyes to the man 
behind the desk. 

"Now, then, what are you after?" 
asked the man, settling his bulk 
down behind the desk, his eyes 
guarded, revealing a trace of boredom. 



TAM was suddenly bitterly 
ashamed of his shabby appearance, the two-day stubble on his 
chin. He felt a dampness on his 
forehead, and tried to muster some 
of the old power and determination 
into his voice. "I need a job," he 
said. "I've had plenty of experience 
with radio-electronics and remote 
control power operations. I'd make 
a good mine-operator—" 

"I can read," the man cut in 
sharply, gesturing toward the application form with the ink blot in 
the middle. "I read all about your 
experience. But I can't use you. 
There aren't any more openings." 

Tarn's ears went red. "But you're 
always advertising," he countered. 
"You don't have to worry about me 
working on Mars, either — I've 
worked on Mars before, and I can 
work six, seven hours, even, without a mask or equipment — " 

The man's eyebrows raised 
slightly. "How very interesting," he 
said flatly. "The fact remains that 



there aren't any jobs open for you." 

The cold, angry flame flared up 
in Tarn's throat suddenly, forcing 
out the sense of futility and defeat. 
"Those other men," he said sharply. "I was here before them. That 
girl wouldn't let me in — " 

Randall's eyes narrowed amusedly. "What a pity," he said sadly. 
"And just think, I hired every one 
of them — His face suddenly 
hardened, and he sat forward, his 
eyes glinting coldly. "Get smart, 
Peters. I think Marsport Mines can 
somehow manage without you. You 
or any other Sharkie. The men just 
don't like to work with Sharkies." 

Rage swelled up in Tarn's chest, 
bitter futile rage, beating at his 
temples and driving away all 
thought of caution. "Look," he 
grated, bending over the desk 
threateningly. "I know the law of 
this system. There's a fair-employment act on the books. It says that 
men are to be hired by any company in order of application when 
they qualify equally in experience. 
I can, prove my experience — " 

Randall stood up, his face 
twisted contemptuously. "Get out 
of here," he snarled. "You've got 
nerve, you have, come crawling in 
here with your law! Where do you 
think you are?" His voice grated in 
the still air of the office. "We don't 
hire Sharkies, law or no law, get 
that? Now get out of here!" 

Tarn turned, his ears burning, 
and strode through the office, blindly, kicking open the door and 
almost running to the quiet air of 
the street outside. The girl at the 
desk yawned, and snickered, and 
went back to her typing with an 
unpleasant grin. 



MARLEY'S CHAIN 



29 



Tam walked the street, block 
after block, seething, futile rage 
swelling up and bubbling over, 
curses rising to his lips, clipped off 
with some last vestige of self-control. At last he turned into a small 
downtown bar and sank wearily 
onto a stool near the door. The 
anger was wearing down now to a 
sort of empty, hopeless weariness, 
dulling his senses, exaggerating 
the hunger in his stomach. He had 
expected it, he told himself, he had 
known what the answer would be 
— but he knew that he had hoped, 
against hope, against what he had 
known to be the facts; hoped desperately that maybe someone 
would listen. Oh, he knew the laws, 
all right, but he'd had plenty of 
time to see the courts in action. Unfair employment was almost impossible to make stick under any 
circumstances, but with the courts 
rigged the way they were these 
days — he sighed, and drew out one 
of his last credit-coins. "Beer," he 
muttered as the barkeep looked up. 

The bartender scowled, his 
heavy-set face a picture of fashionable distaste. Carefully he filled 
every other order at the bar. Then 
he grudgingly set up a small beer, 
mostly foam, and flung some smallcoin change down on the bar before Tam. Tam stared at the" glass, 
the little proud flame of anger flaring slowly. 

A fat man, sitting nearby, stared 
at him for a long moment, then 
took a long swill of beer from 
his glass. " 'Smarter, Sharkie? 
Whyncha drink y'r beer 'n get t' 
hell out o' here?" 

Tam stared fixedly at his glass, 
giving no indication of having 



heard a word. 

The fat man stiffened a trifle, 
swung around to face him. "Goddam Sharkie' s too good to talk to a 
guy," he snarled loudly. "Whassamatter, Sharkie, ya deaf?" 

Tarn's hand trembled as , he 
reached for the beer, took a short 
swallow. Shrugging, he set the glass 
on the bar and got up from his 
stool. He walked out, feeling many 
eyes on his back. 

He walked. Time became a blur 
to a mind beaten down by constant 
rebuff. He became conscious of 
great weariness of both mind and 
body. Instinct screamed for rest. . . 



TAM sat up, shaking his head to 
clear it. He shivered from the 
chill of the park — the cruel pressure 
of the bench. He pulled up his collar and moved out into the street 
again. 

There was one last chance. Cautiously his mind skirted the idea, 
picked it up, regarded it warily, 
then threw it down again. He had 
promised himself never to consider 
it, years before, in the hot, angry 
days of the Revolt. Even then he 
had had some inkling of the shape 
of things, and he had promised 
himself, bitterly, never to consider 
that last possibility. Still — 

Another night in the cold out-ofdoors could kill him. Suddenly he 
didn't care any more, didn't care 
about promises, or pride, or anything else. He turned into a public 
telephone booth, checked an address in the thick New Denver 
book — 

He knew he looked frightful as 
he stepped onto the elevator, felt 



30 



ALAN E. NOURSE 



the cold eyes turn away from him in 
distaste. Once he might have been 
mortified, felt the deep shame 
creeping up his face, but he didn't 
care any longer. He just stared 
ahead at the moving panel, avoiding- the cold eyes, until the fifth 
floor was called. 

The office was halfway down the 
dark hallway. He saw the sign on 
the door, dimly: "United Continents Bureau of Employment", and 
down in small letters below, "Planetary Division, David G. Hawke." 

Tarn felt the sinking feeling in 
his stomach, and opened the door 
apprehensively. It had been years 
since he had seen Dave, long years 
filled with violence and change. 
Those years could change men, too. 
Tam thought, fearfully; they could 
make even the greatest men change. 
He remembered, briefly, his promise 
to himself, made just after the Revolt, never to trade on past friendships, never to ask favors of those 
men he had known before, and befriended. With a wave of warmth, 
the memory of those old days broke 
through, those days when he had 
roomed with Dave Hawke, the long, 
probing talks, the confidences, the 
deep, rich -knowledge that they had 
shared each others dreams and 
ideals, that they had stood side by 
side for a common cause, though 
they were such different men, from 
such very different worlds. Ideals 
had been cheap in those days, talk 
easy, but still, Tam knew that Dave 
had been sincere, a firm, stout 
friend. He had known, then, the sincerity in the big lad's quiet voice, 
felt the rebellious fire in his eyes. 
They had understood each other, 
then, deeply, sympathetically, in 



spite of the powerful barrier they 
sought to tear down — 
The girl at the desk caught his 
eye, looked up from her work without smiling. "Yes?" 

"My name is Tam Peters. I'd like 
to see Mr. Hawke." His voice was 
thin, reluctant, reflecting overtones 
of the icy chill in his chest. So much 
had happened since those long-dead 
days, so many things to make men 
change — 

The girl was grinning, her face 
like a harsh mask. "You're wasting 
your time," she said, her voice brittle. 

Anger flooded Tarn's face. "Listen," he hissed. "I didn't ask for 
your advice. I asked to see Dave 
Hawke. If you choose to announce 
me now, that's fine. If you don't 
see fit, then I'll go in without it. 
And you won't stop me — " 

The girl stiffened, her eyes angry. "You'd better not get smart," 
she snapped, watching him warily. , 
"There are police in the building. 
You'd better not try anything, or 
I'll call them!" ' 

"That's enough Miss Jackson." 

The girl turned to the man in 
the office door, her eyes disdainful. 

The man stood in the doorway, a 
giant, with curly black hair* above 
a high, intelligent forehead, dark 
brooding eyes gleaming like live 
coals in the sensitive face. Tam 
looked at him, and suddenly his 
knees would hardly support him, 
and his voice was a tight whisper — 

"Dave!" 

And then the huge man was 
gripping his hand, a strong arm 
around his thin shoulders, the dark, 
brooding eyes soft and smiling. 
"Tam, Tam — It's been so damned 



MARLEY'S CHAIN

long, man< — oh, it's good to see you, 
Tarn. Why, the last I heard, you'd 
taken passage to the Rings — -years 
ago—" 

Weakly, Tam stumbled into the 
inner office, sank into a chair, his 
eyes overflowing, his mind a turmoil of joy and relief. The huge 
man slammed the door to the outer 
office and settled down behind the 
desk, sticking his feet over the 
edge, beaming. "Where have you 
been, Tam? You promised you'd 
look me up any time you came to 
New Denver, and I haven't seen 
you in a dozen years- — " He fished 
in a lower drawer. "Drink?" 

"No, no — thanks. I don't think I 
could handle a drink- — " Tam sat 
back, gazing at the huge man, his 
throat tight. "You look bigger and 
better than ever, Dave." 



DAVE Hawke laughed, a deep 
bass laugh that seemed to start 
at the soles of his feet. "Couldn't 
very well look thin and wan," he 
said. He pushed a cigar box across 
the desk. "Here, light up. I'm on 
these exclusively these days — remember how you tried to get me to 
smoke them, back at the University? How you couldn't stand cigarettes? Said they were for women, 
a man should smoke a good cigar. 
You finally converted me." 

Tam grinned, suddenly feeling 
the warmth of the old friendship 
swelling back. "Yes, I remember. 
You were smoking that rotten corncob, then, because old Prof Tenley 
smoked one that you could smell in 
the back of the room, and in those 
days the Prof could do no wrong — " 

Dave Hawke grinned broadly, 



settled back in his chair as he lit 
the cigar. "Yes, I remember. Still 
got that corncob around somewhere — " he shook his head, his 
eyes dreamy. "Good old Prof Teriley! One in a million — there was 
an honest man, Tam. They don't 
have them like that in the colleges 
these days. Wonder what happened 
to the old goat?" 

"He was killed," said Tam, softly. "Just after the war. Got caught 
in a Revolt riot, and he was shot 
down." 

Dave looked at him, his eyes suddenly sad. "A lot of honest men 
went down in those riots, didn't 
they? That was the worst part of 
the Revolt. There wasn't any provision made for the honest men, the 
really good men." He stopped, and 
regarded Tam closely. "What's the 
trouble, Tam? If you'd been going 
to make a friendly call, you'd have 
done it years ago. You know this 
office has always been open to 
you—" 

Tam stared at his shoe, carefully 
choosing his words, lining them up 
in his mind," a frown creasing his 
forehead. "I'll lay it on the line," he 
said in a low voice. "I'm in a spot. 
That passage to the Rings wasn't 
voluntary. I was shanghaied onto a 
freighter, and had to work for 
eight years without pay to get passage back. I'm broke, and I'm hungry, and I need to see a doctor — " 

"Well, hell!" the big man exploded. "Why didn't you holler sooner? 
Look, Tam — -we've been friends for 
a long time. You know better than 
to hesitate." He fished for his wallet. "Here, I can let you have as 
much as you need— couple hundred?" 



32 



ALAN E. NOURSE 



"No, no — That's not what I'm 
getting at." Tam felt his face flush 
with embarrassment. "I need a job, 
Dave. I need one bad." 

Dave sat back, and his feet came 
off the desk abruptly. He didn't 
look at Tam. "I see," he said softly. 
"A job — " He stared at the ceiling 
for a moment. "Tell you what," he 
said. "The government's opening a 
new uranium mine in a month or 
so — going to be a big project, they'll 
need lots of men — on Mercury — " 

Tarn's eyes fell, a lump growing 
in his throat. "Mercury," he repeated dully. 

"Why, sure, Tam — good pay, 
chance for promotion." 

"I'd be dead in six months on 
Mercury." Tarn's eyes met Dave's, 
trying to conceal the pain. "You 
know that as well as I do, Dave — " 

Dave looked away. "Oh, the docs 
don't know what they're talking 
about — " 

"You know perfectly well that 
they do. I couldn't even stand 
Venus very long. I need a job on 
Mars, Dave — or on Earth." 

"Yes," said Dave Hawke sadly, 
"I guess you're right." He looked 
straight at Tam, his eyes sorrowful. 
"The truth is, I can't help you. I'd 
like to, but I can't. There's nothing 
I can do." 

Tam stared, the pain of disillusionment sweeping through him. 
"Nothing you can do!" he exploded. "But you're the director of this 
bureau! You know every job, open 
on every one of the planets — " 

"I know. And I have to help get 
them filled. But I can't make anyone hire, Tam. I can send applicants, and recommendations, until 
I'm blue in the face, but I can't 



make a company hire — " He 
paused, staring at Tam. "Oh, hell," 
he snarled, suddenly, his face darkening. "Let's face it, Tam. They 
won't hire you. Nobody will hire 
you. You're a Sharkie, and that's 
all there is to it, they aren't hiring 
Sharkies. And there's nothing I can 
do to make them." 

Tam sat as if he had been struck, 
the color draining from his face. 
"But, the law — Dave, you know 
there's a law. They have to hire us, 
if we apply first, and have the 
necessary qualifications." 

The big man shrugged, uneasily. 
"Sure, there's a law, but who's going to enforce it?" 

Tam looked at him, a desperate 
tightness in his throat. "You could 
enforce it. You could if you wanted 
to." 



THE big man stared at him for a 
moment, then dropped his eyes, 
looked down at the desk. Somehow 
this big body seemed smaller, less 
impressive. "I can't do it, Tam. I 
just can't." 

"They'd have to listen to you!" 
Tarn's face was eager. "You've got 
enough power to put it across — the 
court would have to stick to the 
law—" 

"I can't do it." Dave drew nervously on his cigar, and the light in 
his eyes seemed duller, now. "If it 
were just me, I wouldn't hesitate 
a minute." But I've got a wife, a 
family. I can't jeopardize them — " 

"Dave, you know it would be the 
right thing." 

"Oh, the right thing be damned! 
I can't go out on a limb, I tell you. 
There's nothing I can do. I can let

you have money, Tam, as much as 
you need — I could help you set up 
in business, maybe, or anything — • 
but I can't stick my neck out like 
that." 

Tam sat stiffly, coldness seeping 
down into his legs. Deep in his 
heart he had known that this was 
what he had dreaded, not the fear 
of rebuff, not the fear of being 
snubbed, unrecognized, turned out. 
That would have been nothing, 
compared to this change in the 
honest, forthright, fearless Dave 
Hawke he had once known. 
"What's happened, Dave? Back in 
the old days you would have leaped 
at such a chance. I would have— 
the shoe was on the other foot then. 
We talked, Dave, don't you remember how we talked? We were 
friends, you can't forget that. I 
know you, I know what you believe, 
what you think. How can you let 
yourself down?" 

Dave Hawke's eyes avoided 
Tarn's. "Times have changed. 
Those were the good old days, back 
when everybody was happy, almost. 
Everybody but me and a few others 
— at least, it looked that way to" 
you. But those days are gone. 
They'll never come back. This is a 
reaction period, and the reaction is 
bitter. There isn't any place for t 
fighters now, the world is just the 
way people want it, and nobody 
can change it. What do you expect 
me to do?" He stopped, his heavy 
face contorted, a line of perspiration on his forehead. "I hate it," he 
said finally, "but my hands are tied. 
I can't do anything. That's the way 
things are — " 

"But why?" Tam Peters was 
standing, eyes blazing, staring down 



at the big man behind the desk, the 
bitterness of long, weary years tearing into his voice, almost blinding 
him. "Why is that the way things 
are? What have I done? Why do 
we have this mess, where a man 
isn't worth any more than the color 
of his skin — " 

Dave Hawke slammed his fist on 
the desk, and his voice roared out 
in the close air of the office. "Because it was coming!" he bellowed. 
"It's been coming and now it's here 
— and there's nothing on God's 
earth can be done about it!" 

Tarn's jaw sagged, and he stared 
at the man behind the desk. "Dave 
— think what you're saying, 
Dave—" 

"I know right well what I'm saying," Dave Hawke roared, his eyes 
burning bitterly. "Oh, you have no 
idea how long I've thought, the 
fight I've had with myself, the sacrifices I've had to make. You 
weren't born like I was, you weren't 
raised on the wrong side of the 
fence — well, there was an old, old 
Christmas story that I used to read. 
Years ago, before they burned the 
Sharkie books. It was about an evil 
man who went through life cheating people, hating and hurting people, and when he died, he found 
that every evil deed he had ever 
done had become a link in a heavy 
iron chain, tied and shackled to his 
waist. And he wore that chain he 
had built up, and he had to drag it, 
and drag it, from one eternity to 
the next — his name was Marley, remember?" 

"Dave, you're not making 
sense — " 

"Oh, yes, all kinds of sensa. Because you Sharkies have a chain,

ALAN E. NOURSE 



too. You started forging it around 
your ankles back in the classical 
Middle Ages of Earth. Year by 
year you built it up, link by link, 
built it stronger, heavier. You could 
have stopped it any time you chose, 
but you didn't ever think of that. 
You spread over the world, building up your chain, assuming that 
things would always be just the way 
they were, just the way you wanted 
them to be." 

The big man stopped, breathing 
heavily, a sudden sadness creeping 
into his eyes, his voice taking on a 
softer tone. "You were such fools," 
he said softly. "You waxed and 
grew strong, and clever, and confident, and the more power you 
had, the more you wanted. You 
fought wars, and then bigger and 
better wars, until you couldn't be 
satisfied with gunpowder and TNT 
any longer. And finally you divided 
your world into two armed camps, 
and brought Fury out of her box, 
fought with the power of the atoms 
themselves, you clever Sharkies — 
and when the dust settled, and 
cooled off, there weren't very many 
of you left. Lots of us — it was your 
war, remember — but not very many 
of you. Of course there was a Revolt then, and all the boxed up, 
driven in hatred and bloodshed 
boiled up and over, and you Sharkies at long last got your chain tied 
right around your waists. You were 
a long, long time building it, and 
now you can wear it — " 



TAM'S face was chalky. "Dave — 
there were some of us — you 
know there were many of us that 
hated it as much as you did, before 



the Revolt. Some of us fought, some 
of us at least tried — " 

The big man nodded his head, 
bitterly. "You thought you tried, 
sure. It was the noble thing to do, 
the romantic thing, the good thing 
to do. But you didn't really believe 
it. I know — I thought there was 
some hope, back then, some chance 
to straighten things out without a 
Revolt. For a long time I thought 
that you, and those like you, really 
meant all you were saying, I 
thought somehow we could find an 
equal footing, an end to the hatred 
and bitterness. But there wasn't any 
end, and you never really thought 
there ever would be. That made it 
so safe — it would never succeed, so 
when things were quiet it was a 
nice idea to toy around with, this 
equality for all, a noble project 
that couldn't possibly succeed. But 
when things got hot, it was a different matter." He stared at Tarn, his 
dark eyes brooding. "Oh, it wasn't 
just you, Tam. You were my best 
friend, even though it was a hopeless, futile friendship. You tried, 
you did the best you could, I know. 
But it just wasn't true, Tam. When 
it came to the pinch, to a real jam, 
you would have been just like the 
rest, basically. It was built up in 
you, drummed into you, until no 
amount of fighting could ever scour 
it out—" 

Dave Hawke stood up, walked 
over to the window, staring out 
across the great city. Tam watched 
him, the blood roaring in his ears, 
hardly able to believe what he had 
heard from the big man, fighting 
to keep his mind from sinking into 
total confusion. Somewhere a voice 
deep within him seemed to be strug

gling through with confirmation, 
telling him that Dave Ha,wke was 
right, that he never really had believed. Suddenly Dave turned to 
him, his dark eyes intense. "Look, 
Tarn," he said, quickly, urgently. 
"There are jobs you can get. Go to 
Mercury for a while, work the 
mines — not long, just for a while, 
out there in the sun — then you can 
come back—" 

Tarn's ears burned, fierce anger 
suddenly bursting in his mind, a 
feeling of loathing. "Never," he 
snapped. "I know what you mean. 
I don't do things that way. That's 
a coward's way, and by God, I'm 
no coward!" 

"But it would be so easy, Tam — " 
Dave's eyes were pleading now. 
"Please—" 

Tarn's eyes glinted. "No dice. 
I've got a better idea. There's one 
thing I can do. It's not very nice, 
but at least it's honest, and square. 
I'm hungry. There's one place 
where I can get food. Even Sharkies get food there. And a bed to 
sleep in, and books to read — maybe 
even some Sharkie books, and maybe some paper to w^e on — " He 
stared at the big man, oddly, his 
pale eyes feverish. "Yes, yes, there's 
one place I can go, and get plenty 
to eat, and get away from this eternal rottenness — -" 

Dave looked up at him, his eyes 
suspicious. "Where do you mean?" 

"Prison," said Tam Peters. 

"Oh, now see here- — let's not be 
ridiculous — " 

"Not so ridiculous," snapped 
Tam, his eyes brighter. "I figured it 
all out, before I came up here. I 
knew what you were going to say. 
Sure, go to Mercury, Tam, work in 



the mines a while — well, I can't 
do it that way. And there's only 
one other answer." 

"But, Tam—" 

"Oh, it wouldn't take much. You 
know how the courts handle Sharkies. Just a small offense, to get me 
a few years, then a couple of attempts to break out, and I'd be in 
for life. I'm a Sharkie, remember. 
People don't waste time with us." 

"Tam, you're talking nonsense. 
Good Lord, man, you'd have no 
freedom, no life — " 

"What freedom do I have now?" 
Tam snarled, his voice growing 
wild. "Freedom to starve? Freedom 
to crawl on my hands and knees 
for a little bit of food? I don't want 
that kind of freedom." His eyes 
grew shrewd, shifted slyly to Dave 
Hawke's broad face. "Just a simple 
charge," he said slowly. "Like assault, for instance. Criminal assault — it has an ugly sound, doesn't 
it, Dave? That should give me ten 
years — " his fist clenched at his 
side. "Yes, criminal assault is just 
what ought to do the trick — " 

The big man tried to dodge, but 
Tam was too quick. His fist caught 
Dave in the chest, and Tam was 
on him like a fury, kicking, scratching, snarling, pounding. Dave 
choked and cried out, "Tam, for 
God's sake stop — " A blow caught 
him in the mouth, choking off his 
words as Tam fought, all the hate 
and bitterness of long weary years 
translated into scratching, swearing 
desperation. Dave pushed him off, 
like a bear trying to disentangle a 
maddened dog from his fur, but 
Tam was back at him, fighting 
harder. The door opened, and Miss

they'd known. But even the stars had 
changed. Did the fate of all creation hinge 
upon an — 



AN 

EMPTY 

BOTTLE 

By Mari Wolf 



HUGH McCANN took the last 
of the photographic plates out 
of the developer and laid them on 
the table beside the others. Then 
he picked up the old star chartsVolume 1, Number 1 — maps of 
space from various planetary systems within a hundred light years 
of Sol. He looked around the observation room at the others. 

"We might as well start checking." 

The men and women around the 
table nodded. None of them said 
anything. Even the muffled conversation from the corridor beyond 
the observation room ceased as the 



people stopped to listen. 

McCann set the charts down and 
opened them at the first sheet— the 
composite map of the stars as seen 
from Earth. "Don't be too disappointed if we're wrong," he said. 

Amos Carhill's fists clenched. He 
leaned across the table. "You still 
don't believe we're near Sol, do 
you? You're getting senile, Hugh! 
You know the mathematics of our 
position as well as anybody." 

"I know the math," Hugh said 
quietly. "But remember, a lot of 
our basics have already proved 
themselves false this trip. We can't 
be sure of anything. Besides, I think 



37 



38 



MARI WOLF 



I'd remember this planet we're on 
if we'd ever been here before. We 
visited every planetary system within a hundred light years of Sol the 
first year." 

Carhill laughed. "What's there to 
remember about this hunk of rock? 
Tiny, airless, mountainless — the 
most monotonous piece of matter 
we've landed on in years." 

Hugh shrugged and turned to the 
next chart. The others clustered 
around him, checking, comparing 
the chart with the photographic 
plates of their position, finding 
nothing familiar in the star pattern. 

"I still think we would have remembered this planet," Hugh said. 
"Just because it is so monotonous. 
After all, what have' we been looking for, all these years? Life. Other 
worlds with living forms, other types 
of evolution, types adapted to different environments. This particular planet is less capable of supporting life than our own Moon." 

Martha Carhill looked up from 
the charts. Her face was as tense 
and strained as her husband's, and 
the lines about her mouth deeply 
etched. "We've got to be near 
Earth. We've just got to. We've got 
to find people again." Her voice 
broke. "We've been looking for so 
long—" 

Hugh McCann sighed. The 
worry that had been growing in him 
ever since they first left the rim of 
the galaxy and turned homeward 
deepened into a nagging fear. He 
didn't know why he was afraid. He 
too hoped that they were near 
Earth. He almost believed that they 
would soon be home. But the others, 
their reactions — He shook his head. 

They no longer merely hoped. 



With them, especially with the older, 
ones, it was faith, a blind, unreasoning, fanatic faith that their journey 
was almost over and they would be 
on Earth again and pick up the 
lives they had left behind fifty-three 
years before. 

"Look," Amos Carhill said. 
"Here are our reference points. 
Here's Andromeda Galaxy, and the 
dark nebula, and the arch of our 
own Milky Way." He pointed to 
the places he had named on the 
plates. "Now we can check some 
of these high magnitude reference 
stars with the charts." 

Hugh let him take the charts and 
go through them, checking, rejecting. Carhill was probably right. 
He'd find Sol soon enough. 

It had been too long for one 
shipful of people to follow a quest, 
especially a hopeless one. For fiftythree years they had scouted the 
galaxy, looking for other worlds 
with life forms. A check on diverging evolutions, they had called it — 
uncounted thousands of suns without planets, bypassed. Thousands 
of planetary systems, explored, or 
merely looked at and rejected. 
Heavy, cold worlds with methane 
atmospheres and lifeless rocks without atmospheres and even earthsized, earth-type planets, with 
oceans and oxygen and warmth. But 
no life. No life anywhere. 

That was one of the basics they 
had lost, years ago — their belief that 
life would arise on any planet 
capable of supporting it. 

"We could take a spectrographic 
analysis of some of those high magnitude stars," Carhill said. Then 
abruptly he straightened, eyes 
alight, his hand on the last chart.

"We don't need it after all. Look! 
There's Sirius, and here it is on the 
plates. That means Alpha Centauri 
must be — " 

He paused. He frowned and ran 
his hand over the plate to where the 
first magnitude star was photographed. "It must be. Alpha Centauri. It has to be!" 

"Except that it's over five degrees 
out of position." Hugh looked at the 
plate, and then at the chart, and 
then back at the plate again. And 
then he knew what it was that he 
had feared subconsciously all along. 

"You're right, Amos." he said 
slowly. "There's Alpha Centauri— 
about twenty light years away. And 
there's Sirius, and Arcturus and 
Betelgeuse and all the others." He 
pointed them out, one by one, in 
their unfamiliar locations on the 
plates. "But they're all out of position, in reference to each other." 



HE stopped. The others stared 
back at him, not saying anything. Little by little the faith began 
to drain out of their eyes. 

"What does it mean?" Martha 
GarhiU's voice was only a whisper. 

"It means that we discarded one 
basic too many," Hugh McCann 
said. "Relativity. The theory that 
our subjective time, here on the 
ship, would differ from objective 
time outside." 

"No," Amos Carhill said slowly. 
"No, it's a mistake. That's all. We 
haven't gone into the future. We 
can't have. It isn't possible that 
more time has elapsed outside the 
ship than — -" 

"Why not?" Hugh said softly. 
"Why not millions of years? We've 



exceeded the speed of light, many 
times." 

"Which disproves that space-time 
theory in itself!" Carhill shouted. 

"Does it?" Hugh said. "Or does 
it just mean we never really understood space-time at all?" He didn't 
wait for them to answer. He pointed 
at the small, far from brilliant, star 
that lay beyond Alpha Centauri on 
the plates, "That's probably Sol. If 
it is, we can find out the truth soon 
enough." 

He looked at their faces and wondered what their reactions would 
be, if the truth was what he feared. 



The ship throbbed softly, pulsating in the typical vibrations of 
low speed drive. In the forward 
viewscreens the star grew larger. 
The people didn't look at it very 
often. They moved about the corridors of the ship, much as they usually moved, but quietly. They seemed 
to be trying to ignore the star. 

"You can't be sure, Hugh." Nora 
McCann laid her hand on her hushand's arm. 

"No, of course I can't be sure." 

The door from their quarters into 
the corridor was open. Several more 
people came in— young people who 
had been born on the ship. They 
were talking and laughing. 

"Would it be so hard on the 
young ones, Hugh? They've never 
seen the Earth. They're used to 
finding nothing but lifeless worlds 
everywhere." 

One of the young boys in the hall 
looked up at the corridor viewscreen 
and pointed at the star and then 
shrugged. The others turned away, 
not saying anything, and after a 



40 



MARI WOLF 



minute they left and the boy followed them. 

"There's your answer," Hugh 
McCann said dully. "Earth's a symbol to them. It's home. It's the place 
where there are millions more like 
us. Sometimes I think it's the only 
thing that has kept us sane all these 
years — the knowledge that there is 
a world full of people, somewhere, 
that we're not alone." 

Her hand found his and he 
gripped it, almost absently, and 
then he looked up at their own small 
viewscreen. The star was much bigger now. It was already a definite 
circle of yellow light. 

A yellow G-type sun, like a thousand others they had approached 
and orbited around and left behind 
them. A yellow sun that could have 
been anywhere in the galaxy. 

"Hugh," she said after a moment, 
"do you really believe that thousands of years have gone by, outside?" 

"I don't know what to believe. I 
only know what the plates show." 

"That may not even be Sol, up 
ahead," she said doubtfully. "We 
rriay be in some other part of space 
altogether, and that's why the 
charts are different." 

"Perhaps. But either way we're 
lost. Lost in space or in time or in 
both. What does it matter?" 

"If we're just lost in space it's 
not so — .so irrevocable. We could 
still find our way back to Earth, 
maybe." 

He didn't answer. He looked up 
at the screen and the circle of\ light 
and his lips tightened. Whatever the 
truth was, they didn't have long to 
wait. They'd be within gravitational 
range in less than an hour. 



He wondered why he was reacting so differently from the others. 
He was just as afraid as they were. 
He knew that. But he wasn't fighting the thought that perhaps they 
had really traveled out of their own 
time. He wondered what it was that 
made him different from the other 
old ones, the ones like Carhill who 
refused even to face the possibility, 
who insisted on clinging to their 
illusions in the face of the photographic evidence. 



HE didn't think that he was a 
pessimist. And yet, after only 
three years of their trip, after 
only fifty Earthlike but lifeless 
worlds, he had been the first to consider the possibility that life was 
unique to Earth and that their old 
theories concerning its spontaneous 
emergence from a favorable environment might be wrong. 

Only Nora had agreed with him 
then. Only Nora could face this possibility with him now. The two of 
them were very much alike in their 
outlooks. They were both pragmatists. 

But this time there would be no 
long years during which the others 
could slowly shift their opinions, 
slowly relinquish their old beliefs 
and turn to new ones. The yellow 
sun was too large and urgent in the 
screen. 

"Hugh!" 

He turned to the door and saw 
Arrios Carhill standing there, bracing himself against the corridor 
wall. There was no color at all in 
CarhilFs face. 

"Come on up to the control room 
with me, Hugh. We're going to start 



AN EMPTY BOTTLE 



41 



decelerating any minute now." 

Hugh frowned- He would prefer 
to stay and watch their approach on 
the screen, with Nora at his side. 
He had no duties in the controlroom. He was too old to have any 
part in the actual handling of the 
ship. Amos was old, too. But they 
would be there, all the old ones, 
looking through the high powered 
screens for the first clear glimpse of 
the third planet from the sun. 

"All right, Amos." Hugh got up 
and started for the door. 

"I'll wait here for you, Hugh," 
Nora said. 

He smiled at her and then followed Carhill out into the crowded 
corridor. No one spoke to them. 
Most of the people they passed were 
neither talking, nor paying any attention to anything except the corridor screens, which they could no 
longer ignore. The few who were 
talking spoke about Earth and how 
wonderful it would be to get home 
again. 

"You're wrong, Hugh," Amos 
said suddenly. 

"I hope I am." 

The crowd thinned out as they 
passed into the forward bulkheads. 
The only men they saw now were 
•the few young ones on duty. Except 
for their set, anxious faces they 
might have been handling any 
routine landing in any routine system. 

The ship quivered for just a second as it shifted over into deceleration. There was an instant of vertigo 
and then it was gone and the ship's 
gravity felt as normal as ever. Hugh 
didn't even break stride at the shift. 

He followed Carhill to the control room doorway and pushed his 



way in, taking a place among the 
others who already clustered about 
the great forward screen. The pilot 
ignored them and worked his controls. The screen cleared as the 
ship's deceleration . increased. The 
pilot didn't look at it. He was a 
young man. He had never seen the 
Earth. 

"Look!" Amos Carhill cried triumphantly. 

The screen focused. The selector 
swung away from the yellow sun 
and -swept its orbits. The dots that 
were planets came into focus and 
out again. Hugh McCann didn't 
even need to count them, nor to 
calculate their distance from the 
sun. He knew the system too well to 
have any trouble recognizing it. 

The sun was Sol. The third planet 
was the double dot of Earth and 
moon. He realized suddenly that he 
had more than half expected to see 
an empty orbit. 

"It's the Earth all right," Carhill 
said. "We're home!" 

They were all staring at the double dot, where the selector focused 
sharply now. Hugh McCann alone 
looked past it, at the background of 
stars that were strewn in totally unfamiliar patterns across the sky. He 
sighed. 

"Look beyond the system," he 
said. 

They looked. For a long time they 
stared, none of them speaking, and 
then they turned to Hugh, many of 
them accusingly, as if he himself 
had rearranged the stars. 

"How long have we been gone?" 
Carhill's voice broke. 

Hugh shook his head. The star 
patterns were too unfamiliar for 
even a guess. There was no way of 



42 



MARI WOLF 



knowing, yet, how long their fiftythree years had really been. 



CARHILL shook his head, slowly. He turned back to the 
screen and stared at the still featureless dot that was the Earth. "We 
can't be the only ones left," he said. 

No one answered him. They were 
still stunned. They couldn't even accept, yet, the strange constellations 
on*the screen. 

End of the voyage. Fifty-three 
years of searching for worlds with 
life. And now Earth, under an unfamiliar sky, and quite possibly no 
life at all, anywhere, except on the 
ship. 

"We might as well land," McCann said. 

The ship curved away from the 
night side of the Earth and crossed 
again into the day. They were near 
enough so that the planetary features stood out sharply now, even 
through the dense clouds that rose 
off the oceans. But although the 
continental land masses and the 
islands were clearly defined, they 
were as unrecognizable as the star 
constellations had been. 

"That must be North America," 
Amos Carhill said dully. "It's smaller than the continent on the night 
side " 

"It might be anywhere," Hugh 
McCann said. "We can't tell. The 
• oceans look bigger too. There's less 
land surface." 

He stared down at the topoggraphy thousands of miles below 
them. Mountains rose jaggedly. 
There were great plains, and crevasses, and a rocky, lifeless look 
everywhere. No soil. No erosion, 



except from the wind and the rains. 

"There's no chlorophyll in the 
spectrum," Haines said. "It seems 
to ruie out even plant life." 

"I don't understand." Martha 
Carhill turned away from the 
screen. "Everything's so different. 
But the moon looked just exactly 
like it always did." 

"That's because it has no atmosphere," Hugh said. "So there's no 
erosion. And no oceans to sweep in 
over the land. But I imagine that 
if we explored it we'd find changes. 
New craters. Maybe even new 
mountains by now." 

"How long has it been?" Carhill 
whispered. "And even if it's been 
millions of years, what happened? 
Why aren't there any plants? Won't 
we find anything?" 

"Maybe there was an atomic 
war," the pilot said. 

"Maybe." Carhill had thought of 
that too. Probably all of them had. 
"Or maybe the sun novaed." 

No one answered him. The concept of a nova and then of its dying 
down, until now the sun was just 
as it had been when they left, was 
too much. 

"The sun looks hotter," Carhill 
added. 

The ship dropped lower, its preliminary circle of the planet completed. It settled in for a landing, 
just as it had done thousands of 
times before. And the world below 
could have been any of a thousand 
others. 

They dropped quickly, braking 
through the atmosphere, riding it 
down. The topography came up to 
meet them and the general features 
blurred, leaving details standing out 
sharply, increasing in sharpness as if 



AN EMPTY BOTTLE 



43 



the valleys and mountains below 
were tiny microscopic crystals under 
a rapidly increasing magnification. 

The pilot picked their landing 
place without difficulty. It was a 
typical choice, a spot on the broad 
shelving plain at the edge of the 
ocean. The type of base from which 
all tests on a planet could be run 
quickly, and a report written up, 
and the files of another world closed 
and tagged with a number and entered in one of the great storage encyclopedias. 

Even to Hugh there was an air of 
unreality about the landing, as if 
this planet wasn't really Earth at 
all, despite its orbit around the sun, 
despite its familiar moon. It looked 
too much like too many others. 

The actual landing was over 
quickly. The ship quivered, jarred 
slightly, and then was still, resting 
on the gravelled plain that had obviously once been part of the ocean 
bed. The ocean itself lay only, a few 
hundred yards away. 

Hugh McCann . looked out 
through the viewscreen, turned to 
direct vision now. He stared at the 
waves swelling against the shore and 
his sense of unreality deepened. 
Even though this was what he had 
more than half expected, he 
couldn't quite accept it, yet. 

"We might as well go out and 
look around," he said. 

"Air pressure, Earth-norm." 
Haines began checking off the control panel by rote. "Composition: 
oxygen, nitrogen, water vapor—" 

"There's certainly nothing out 
there that could hurt us," Martha 
Carhill snapped. "What could there 
be?" 

"We might check for radioactiv


ity," Hugh said quietly. 

She turned and stared at him. 
Her mouth opened and then 
snapped shut again. 

"No," Haines said. "There's no 
radioactivity either. Everything's 
clear. We won't need space suits." 

He pressed the button that 
opened the inner locks. 



CARHILL glanced over at him 
and then switched on the communicator, and the noises from the 
rest of the ship flooded into the 
control room. Everywhere people 
were milling about. Snatches of talk 
drifted in, caught up in the background as various duty officers, reported clearance on the landing. 
Most of the background voices were 
young, talking too loudly and with 
too much forced cheerfulness about 
what lay outside the ship. 

Hugh sighed, as aware of all the 
people as if he were out in the corridors with them. It was the spaceborn ones who were doing most of 
the talking. The children, the young 
people, the people no longer young 
but still born since the voyage 
started, still looking upon Earth 
more as a wonderful legend than as 
their own place of origin. 

The old ones, those who had left 
the Earth in their own youth, had 
the least of all to say. They knew 
what was missing outside. The 
younger ones couldn't really know. 
Even the best of the books and the 
pictures and the three dimensional 
movies can give only a superficial 
idea of what a living world is like. 

"Hugh." Carhill clutched his 
arm. 

"Yes, Amos."

"There must be people, somewhere. There have to be. Our race 
can't be dead." 

Hugh McCann looked past him, 
out at the sky and the clouds of 
water vapor that swirled up to obscure the sun. The stars, of course, 
were completely hidden in the daylight." 

"If there are any others, Amos, 
we can be pretty certain they're not 
on Earth." 

"They may have left. They .may 
have gone somewhere else." 

"No!" Martha Carhill's face 
twisted and then went rigid. 
"There's no one anywhere. There 
can't be. It's been too long. You 
saw the stars, Amos — the stars' — all 
wrong, every one of them!" 

Her hands came up to her face 
and she started to cry. Amos crossed 
over to her and put his arms around 
her. 

Hugh McCann watched them for 
a moment and then he turned and 
left them and went out through the 
locks after the young people. He 
didn't know what to think. He 
wished that they had never turned 
back to Earth at all, that they had 
kept going, circling around the rim 
of the galaxy forever. 

He went through the outer lock 
and then down the ramp to the 
ground. 

He stood on the Eartlr again, for 
the first time since his" early youth. 
And it was not the same. There was 
bare rock under his feet and bare 
rock all around him, gravel and 
boulders and even fine grained 
sand. But no dust. No dirt. No trace 
of anything organic or even ever 
touched by anything organic. 

He had walked too many worlds 



like this. Too many bare gray worlds 
with bare gray oceans and clouds 
of vapor swirling up into the warm 
air. Too many worlds where there 
was wind and sound and surf j where 
there should have been life, but 
wasn't. 

This was just another of those 
worlds. This wasn't Earth. This 
was just a lifeless memory of the 
Earth he had known and loved. 
For fifty-three years they had 
clung to the thought of home, of 
people waiting for them, welcoming 
them back someday. Fifty-three 
years, and for how many of those 
ship-years had Earth lain lifeless 
like this? 

He looked up at the sky and at 
all the stars that he couldn't see 
and he cursed them all and cursed 
time itself and then, bitterly, his 
own fatuous stupidity. 

The people came out of the ship 
and walked about on the graveled 
plain, alone or in small groups. 
They had stopped talking. They 
seemed too numbed by what they 
had found to even think, for a 
while. 

Shock, Hugh McCann thought 
grimly. First'hysteria and tears and 
loud unbelief, and now shock. Anything could come next. 



HE STOOD with the warm 
wind blowing in his face and 
watched the people. In the bitter 
mood that gripped him he was 
arrtused by their reactions. Some of 
them walked around aimlessly, but 
most, those who were active in the 
various departments, soon started 
about the routine business of running tests on planetary conditions. 



AN EMPTY BOTTLE

They seemed to work without 
thinking, by force of habit, their 
faces dazed and uncaring. 

Conditioning, Hugh thought. 
Starting their reports. The reports 
that they know perfectly well no 
one will ever read. 

He wandered over to where 
several of the young men were sending up an ( atmosphere balloon and 
jotting down the atmospheric constituents as recorded by the instruments. 

"How's it going?" he said. 

"Earth-norm. Naturally — " The 
young man flushed. 

"Temperature's up though. 
Ninety-three. And a seventy-seven 
percent humidity." 

He left them and walked down 
across the .rocks to the ocean's edge. 
Two young girls were down there 
before him, sampling the water, 
running both chemical and biological probing tests. 

"Hello, Mr. McCann," the taller 
girl said dully. "Want our report?" 

"Found anything?" He knew already that there was nothing to 
find. If there were life the instruments would have recorded its presence. 

"No. Water temperature eightysix. Sodium chloride four-fifths 
Earth normal." She looked up, surprised. "Why so low?" 

"More water in the ocean, maybe. Or maybe we've had a nova 
since we were here last." 

It was getting late, almost sunset. 
Soon it would be time for the 
photographic star-charts to be 
made. Hugh brought himself up 
short and smiled bitterly. He too 
was in the grip of habit. Still, why 
not? Perhaps they could estimate, 



somehow, how many millions of 
years had passed. 

Why? What good would it do 
them to find out? 

After a while the sun set and a 
little later the full moon »ose, hazy 
and indistinct behind the clouds of 
water vapor. Hugh stared at it, 
watched it rise higher until it 
cleared the horizon, a great bloated 
bulk. Then he sighed and shook his 
head to clear it and started to work. 
The clouds were thick. He had to 
move the screening adjustment almost to its last notch before the 
vapor patterns blocked out and the 
stars were bright and unwavering 
and ready to be photographed. He 
inserted the first plate and snapped 
the picture of the stars whose names 
he knew but whose patterns were 
wrong, some subtly, some blatantly. 

There was something he was 
overlooking. Some other factor, not 
taken into account. He developed 
the first plates and compared them 
with the star charts of Earth as it 
had been before they left it, and 
he shook his head. Whatever the 
factor was, it eluded him. He went 
back to work. 

"Oh, here you are, Hugh." 

He jumped at the sound of Carhill's voice. He had been working 
almost completely by habit, slowly 
swinging the telescope across the 
sky and snapping the plates. And 
trying to think. 

"Why waste time on that?" Carhill added bitterly. "Who's ever 
going to see our records now?" 

Behind Carhill, several of the 
other old ones nodded. Hugh was 
surprised that they had managed to 
come back to the ship without his 
hearing them. But of course they 



46 



MARI WOLF 



had come back in at sundown, as 
usual on a routine check, and now 
they were gathering to compile 
their reports. Hugh looked from 
face to face, wondering if he too 
was as numb and dazed and haggard appearing as they were. He 
probably was. 

"What do you suggest; Amos?" 
he said. 

"I say there's no use going on," 
Carhill said flatly. "You've all run 
your tests. And what have you 
found? No fossils. Not even a single-celled life form in the ocean. 
No way even to tell how many millions of years it's been." 

"Maybe it hasn't been so long," 
Haines said. "Maybe something 
happened here fairly recently, and 
the people all went to some other 
system — to one of the Gentauri 
planets, maybe." 

Amos Carhill laughed bitterly. 
"You can say that in the face of the 
evidence? We know that millions 
of years have passed. Nothing's the 
same. Even the tides are three times 
what they were. It's obvious what 
happened. The sun novaed. Novaed and cooled. Do you really believe that our race has lasted that 
long, on some nearby system?" 



HIS voice rose. He glared about 
at the others. He threw back 
his head suddenly and laughed, and 
the laughter echoed and re-echoed 
off the steel walls. 

"I say let's die_now!" Carhill 
cried. "There's no use going on. 
Hugh was right, as usual. We 
shouldn't have tried to come back. 
We've been fools, all these years, 
thinking we had a world to come 



home to." 

The people muttered, crowded 
closer. They pushed into the observation room, shoved nearer to it 
in the outside corridor. They muttered in a rising note of panic as 
the numbing shock that gripped 
them gave way. 

"Why not die here?" Martha 
Carhill's voice rose shrill above the 
sound of her husband's laughter. 
"We should have died here millions 
of years ago!" 

Hugh McCann looked at her and 
at Amos and at all the others. He 
sighed. Why not? Why go on? 
There was no answer. Even a pragmatist gave up eventually, when the 
facts were all against him. 

He glanced down at the reports 
on the table. All the routine reports, gathered together into routine form, written up in routine 
terminology. Reports on an Earthtype planet that just happened to 
be the Earth itself. 

And then, quite suddenly, the 
obvious, satisfactory answer came 
to him. The factors clicked into 
place, and he wondered why he 
hadn't thought of them long ago. 
He looked up from the reports, at 
the people on the verge of panic, 
and he knew what to say to quiet 
them. He had the factors now. 

"No!" he cried. "You're wrong. 
There's no reason at all to assume 
that our race is dead!" 

Ames Carhill stopped laughing 
and stared at him and the others 
stared also and none of them believed him at all. 

"It's simple!" he cried. "Why 
has so much time passed outside the 
ship while to us only fifty-three 
years have gone by?" 



AN EMPTY BOTTLE 



47 



"Because we traveled too fast," 
Carhill said flatly. "That's .why." 

"Yes," Hugh said softly. "But 
there's one thing we've been forgetting. What we did, others could 
do also. Probably lots of expeditions 
started out after we left, all trying 
for the speed of light." 

They stared at him. Slowly the 
dazed look died out of their eyes as 
they realized what he meant, and 
what the concept might mean to 
them. The concept of other ships, 
following them out into time. The 
concept of other men, also millions 
of years from the Earth they ha3 
left. 

"You mean," Carhill said slowly, 
"that you believe other people got 
caught in the same trap we did — 
that there may be others in this time 
also?" 

Hugh nodded. "Why not? Maybe they colonized some of those 
Earth-type planets we checked on. 
Anyway, we can look for them." 

"No." Carhill shook his head. "If 
any of them had started after us 
we would have crossed their paths 
already. We never have. We never 
found a trace of any other expedition. Even if there is another, even 
if there are colonies somewhere, we 
could spend another fifty years 
looking." 

"Well," Martha Carhill whispered. "Why not? It would give us 
something to look for." 

Hugh McCann glanced around 
the circle of faces and saw the new 
hope that came into them, the new 
belief that sprang into existence so 
quickly because they wanted to believe. He smiled, somewhat sadly, 
and picked up the pile of reports 
and the photographs he had just 



developed. Then he slipped out of 
the room, through the crowd outside, away from them and the rising 
hum of their voices. He didn't need 
to say anything more. The ship 
would go on. 



"TTUGH, is that you?" 

XI "Yes, Nora." 

She was waiting for him in the 
corridor. She came up to him and 
smiled and slipped her arm through 
his. They walked on together, down 
the hall past the last of the people. 

"I heard what you said, Hugh. 
You convinced them." 

He nodded. "I wonder why it 
took me so long to think of it." 

The voices died away behind 
them. They were all alone. They 
rounded a corner where a viewscreen picked up the image of the 
moon, so familiar, now the only 
thing that was familiar about this 
Earth. Nora shivered. 

"You were very logical, Hugh. 
But I didn't believe you." 

He glanced around and saw that 
there was ho one near them and 
that the communicators in this part 
of the ship were turned off. Only 
then did he answer her. 

"I didn't believe myself, Nora." 

"Tell me." 

"When we're outside." 

They went down the winding 
ramp that led to the interior of the 
ship. It too was deserted now. They 
left the carpeted, muffled corridors 
and their footsteps rang on the steel 
plates that lay down the middle of 
the ship, its heart, where the energy 
converters were, and the disposal 
units, and the plant rooms, and the 
great glass spheres of the hydro


48 



MARI WOLF 



ponies tanks. 

'"It's ironic, isn't it?" Nora said 
slowly. "We left here so long ago, 
looking for worlds with life, and we 
come back to find our own world 
dead." 

"It's ironic, all right." He walked 
along the tow of tanks until he 
came to the one he was searching 
for, and then he picked up a glass 
cylinder and filled it from the tank. 

"I had to tell them something, 
Nora. They couldn't have gone on, 
otherwise." 

The bottle was full. He stoppered 
it and then turned away. They 
crossed to the nearest lock and he 
pushed the button that opened it. 
They waited a few minutes until 
the door came open, and then they 
went out, down the ramp to the 
ground, across the slippery rocks. 
Even through the clouds there was 
enough light to see by. 

"It's warm," she said. 

"It always is, now." 

They were approaching the 
ocean. The surf beat loudly in theii 
ears. The spray was warm against 
their faces, almost as warm as the 
night wind. 

"Tell me," she said. "You know 
what really happened, don't you?" 

"I think so. I can't really be 
sure." 

They paused on the low ledge 
where he had stood earlier and 
watched the girls gather their data 
for the reports. At their feet the 
waves washed up to the edges of the 
tide pools, eddying into and out of 
them softly. The water looked dark 
and cold, but they knew that it too 
was warm. 

"There've been lots of changes, 
and they all fit a pattern," he said. 



"The temperature. The difference 
in salt content in the water. The 
higher tides. Those things could 
happen for several reasons. But 
there's only one explanation for the 
other changes, the ones I found on 
the star charts." 

She waited. The water lapped in 
and out, reaching almost to where 
they stood. 

"The Earth rotates faster now," 
he said. "And the stars are nearer. 
Much nearer than they were." 

"Isn't that impossible?" 

"How do we know? We exceeded 
the speed of light. Who could say 
what continuum that might have 
put us in? I remember an analogy 
I read once, in a layman's book on 
different theories of space-time. *— The future and the past, two 
branches of a hyperbola, each with 
the speed of light as its limit — ' " 

"You mean," she whispered, 
"that we're not in the future at 
all? We're in the past— the far past 
— before there was any life on 
Earth?" 



HE looked down at the pools of 
water at their feet, the lifeless 
water that according to all their 
old discarded theories should have 
been teeming with life. He nodded 
slowly and lifted the glass cylinder 
he had brought from the ship and 
stared at it. 

"That bottle," she whispered. 
"You filled it with bacteria, didn't 
you?" 

He nodded again. 

"You're mad, Hugh. You can't 
mean that that bottle is the origin 
of life on Earth! You can't." 

"Maybe this isn't our Earthj 



AN EMPTY BOTTLE 



49 



Nora. Maybe there are thousands of 
continuums and thousands of 
Earths, all waiting for a ship to land 
someday and give them life." 

Slowly he unstoppered the cylinder and knelt down at the water's 
edge. For a minute he paused, wondering if there were other continuums or only this one, wondering 
just how deep the paradox lay. 
Then he tipped the bottle up and 
poured, and the liquid from the 
cylinder ran down into the tide 
pools and eddied there and was lost 
in the liquid of the ocean. He 
poured until the bottle was empty 
and all the single-celled bacteria 
from the ship's tank mingled with 
the warm, lifeless waters. 

The water temperatures were the 
same. Everything was the same, and 
the conditions were very favorable 
and the bacteria would divide and 
redivide and keep on dividing for 
millions of years. 

"Well hold the ship under light 
speed," he said. "And in a few million years we can drop back here 
and see how evolution is getting 
along." 



He stood up and she took his 
hand and moved closer to him. 
They were both shivering, despite 
the warmth of the air. 

"But how did life originate in 
the beginning?" she asked suddenly. 

Hugh McCann shook his head 
in the darkness. "I don't know. 
We've been all over the galaxy and 
haven't found life anywhere. Perhaps it can't have a natural cause. 
Perhaps it's always planted. A 
closed circle from beginning to 
end." 

"But something — someone — 
must have started the circle. Who?" 

He looked down at the empty 
cylinder that he had dropped at the 
water's edge and then he looked out 
at the ocean, lifeless no longer. And 
once again he shook his head. 

"We did, Nora. We're the beginning." 

For a long moment their eyes met 
and held, and then they turned and 
walked away from the ocean, back 
toward the ship, and the people. 
And the moonlight .glinted off the 
empty bottle. 



THE END 



Personalities 



IN SCIENCE FICTION 



JULES VERNE 

Today, He Would Be 
Amazed 



IN DESIGNATING Jules Verne 
as the father of science fiction 
as it is known today, one can 
immediately draw sharp criticism 
from those who allocate the role to 
Leonardo da Vinci. It is an honor, 
however, that the great Italian 
could easily give away as a crumb 
from his table. And one Verne must 
have in order to gain the stature he 
deserves, and also as payment for 
well nigh incredible work as a 
pioneer. 

Verne, a Frenchman, was born in 
1828 in Nantes. There was neither 
great wealth, nor excessive poverty 
in his background. He received an 
adequate education, and if tb,ere 
was any point of particular interest 
in his youth, it was the vague, but 
definitely tangible restlessness that 
plagued his early years. 

He became a fairly successful 
playwright long before there is any 
indication of his later interest in 
the scientific fiction through which 
his name will live. 

A close study of Verne, high


lights the fact that he himself is 
only half his own story. To get the 
full picture, he must be considered 
along with the time in which he 
lived. 

It was a time of the colossal 
French unrest that ended in one of 
the greatest bloodbaths in history. 
The masses — a designation so dear 
to the heart of the ponderous historian- — were stirring under the perfumed heels of the French aristocrats. Every school child knows 
what happened. 

But another revolution of the 
period, centered in the industrial 
Europe of the times, has been to a 
great extent overlooked or generalized, perhaps because its?* endresult was not outlined by the sharp 
blade of a guillotine. 

The industrial revolution. 

The intellectual level, nay the 
intelligence level, of the period was 
low, but there was enough perception to fear the Machine and what 
it could do. Science was a completely unknown and untried component. The theory of science creating 
machines which would in turn free 
men from previously necessitous 
slavery was not readily grasped. 
Such a concept had to come from 
some proof in that direction, and at 



50 



PERSONALITIES 



51 



that time there was no proof. 

There was, however, even then, 
proof that machines could put vast 
numbers of men out of work. Under 
the systems of the seventeenth century, this could mean actual starvation for people who earned their 
bread in the labor market. 

It is little wonder, then, that 
science was a thing to be feared 
and this point, in itself, makes Jules 
Verne not only a pioneer, but a very 
remarkable literary technician. To 
understand a man, it is necessary 
to understand what he faces. To get 
the picture, we have but to compare his time with ours. 



THE writer , of today has little 
else to do but experience an 
urge to write and then look around 
for his field. If he selects science fiction as his creative medium, he finds 
a well worn rut into which to fit his 
steering gear. The momentum has 
already been provided. He rides 
along in an established field, partaking of the dignity built by those 
who came before. 

Verne was the first of these. He 
faced a world that really did not 
want what he had — or rather — 
what his imagination and instinct 
forced him to produce. He won his 
audience from a fearful, reluctant 
public, who cringed from what he 
gave them, yet read it from pure 
fascination. 

His works are filled, of course 
with a perceptive power. Perhaps 
very few people today would care 
for them. They are styled to another 
day, a slower and more ponderous 
day when the streamlined stylism of 
today's literature would have been 



as quickly rejected as some of us, today, reject the styles of the old masters. 



VERNE'S work is a paradox, 
in that it is i a mixture of 
astounding perceptions and naive 
inconsistencies. The inconsistencies, 
however, spring from the limitations of the time; limitations which 
even a genius of Verne's stature 
could not overcome. 

As an example, there is an illustration of one of his books on a trip 
to the Moon. The picture is meant 
to highlight the absolute cold of 
space. It shows three men, obviously halfway to the Moon, inside their 
rocket. The room, or cabin, they 
occupy is that of a typical, seventeenth century parlor. It could have 
as easily illustrated a scene from a 
Charles Dickens novel. The three 
men are dressed for the street — for 
a warm day in the street, that is — ■ 
because they haven't a single overcoat among them. One wears a top 
hat and the other two have shawls 
over their heads. They are 
crouched, and stomping their feet 
to keep warm. There seems to be 
some snow drifting in from somewhere. 

But those who would laugh at 
this illustration, could be quickly 
silenced by a drawing of an undersea burial, the stunning impact of 
which has probably never been 
equalled to this day. Save for an 
ancient handlamp held by one of 
the mourners, the illustration would 
do far more than justice to any current science fiction story of underwater activities. 

There are many indications that 



52 



JULES VERNE 



Jules Verne did not write scientific 
fiction from choice; that he possibly nurtured an actual dislike for 
it. He left the field many times to 
further other literary ends. But he 
always came back; possibly because 
his vital and entirely original imagination would not let him do otherwise. 

He produced a prodigious 
amount of copy, all of which in its 
day, was widely read. But it is 
natural that a writer is remembered 
for certain of his works, while the 
bulk of his efforts is lost in the sweep 
of time. Of all his works, Twenty 
Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, 
could be rated as his greatest. Possibly because, in this story, he described with inconceivable accuracy, 
the almost exact shape of a single 
thing to c6me. 

The submarine. 



HIS Around the World in 
Eighty Days will also, probably live as long as books are read. 



But the impact here is somewhat 
blunted in that Verne accurately 
foretold a general future condition 
— the speed at which man would 
someday travel, by whatever method. 

Also, the story is sbmewhaf 
blurred by the fact that even Verne 
himself cauld not envision a condition which time and progress would 
not antiquate. His error here was 
that he left an opening for a sequal 
— Around the World in Eighty 
Minutes. 

This situation does not hold true 
in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. After reading it, one 
can experience only anticlimax no 
matter what has been or will be. 
When Verne finished, there was no 
more to be said. 

But regardless, Verne's niche is 
secure. In a dim and groping past, 
he established, with a quill pen and 
an agile rnind, a trend in scientific 
fiction from which the writer of today or tomorrow will deviate but 
little. — pwf 



It was in neither the stars nor the cards that 
Dr. Mateo Marco Lope Aguirre Malaria, 
the eminent jurist, should retain his neck . . .

U

By L Sprague de Camp 



DR. MATEO Marco Lope 
Aguirre Malaria, the eminent 
jurist, sat at a table in the bar of 
the Convention Quarters and wept 
into his rum. 

These Quarters were those of the 
World Government Constitutional 
Convention, in a set of concrete 
chambers deep underground in the 
Rhone Valley. The accommodations had been hastily converted 
from the former Supreme Headquarters, United Civilized State's^ 
usually known as SHUCKS. The 
Convention was taking place in this 
armored warren, first, because most 
of the earth's larger cities had taken 
hits in the war and were therefore 
short of housing — when they had 



any houses left at all; second, because the war was not quite over. A 
Communist force still held out in 
the Altai Mountains, and for all 
anyone knew they might have a 
missle or two left with which to 
scotch the Convention if it met on 
the surface. 

A journalist named Dagobert 
Heck sat down at the same table 
and asked : "Why do you weep, Dr. 
Aguirre?" 

"My friend," said Aguirre, "I 
weep because we are off on the 
wrong track. Once again we fail to 
grasp opportunity by the forelock." 

"Oh, I don't know," said Dagobert Heck. "Considering what the 
world has been through lately —

L SPRAGUE DE CAMP 



most of its cities mashed flat and a 
half-billion of its population blown 
to bits — I think we're doing better 
than we had any right to expect. 
We're getting a bigger improvement on the United Nations than 
the United Nations was on the 
League of Nations. The new World 
Government will have a directly 
elected legislature, the right to tax, 
and the world's only armed force. 
Ten years ago we'd have said this 
was Utopian moonshine. Why then 
so sad?" 

"Because these narrow-minded, 
so-called statesmen cannot look beyond the petty confines of their own 
planet!" 

"Oh> you mean the Space 
Clause." Heck closed his eyes and 
recited the beginning of the controversial clause from memory: 
" 'The authority shall have the exclusive right to represery: the peoples of the earth in relations with 
extra-terrestrial life-forms, should 
any such forms be discovered to 
exist; to limit, regulate, and forbid 
intercourse between the peoples of 
the earth and such life-forms; and 
to limit, regulate, and forbid movement of persons and things between 
the earth and other heavenly 
bodies — ' Oh well, it's probably not 
vital. We've been to the moon and 
found nothing but a few viruses, 
and conditions don't look promising 
for life on the other planets either. 

"Exactly what that fool Carstairs-Brown said!" Aguirre mimicked the speech of the British 
delegate. " 'Really, you know, 
wouldn't Her Majesty's Government look a bit silly getting all set to 
welcome the Martians, and having 
it transpire there aren't any?' They 



forget that this is not the only sun 

in the universe." | 

Heck nodded sympathetically. | 
Aguirre went on: 

"And others, I think, hope to defeat the clause so that they can 
carry on nationalistic and imperialistic policies, if not on the earth, 
then off it somewhere." 

"Look here, are you sure the fact 
that you're the author of this clause 
hasn't prejudiced you?" 

"Sir, I have no prejudices!" 
Aguirre lowered his voice. "Save 
perhaps a slight one in favor of living. 

"What do you mean?" 

"You know my glorious chief?" 



HECK nodded. Aguirre's glorious chief was Juan Serafin de 
la Torre Baroja, President of the 
Andean Federation, a new political 
entity that had taken the place, 
amid the general uproar of World 
War III, of several of the nations of 
western South America. Not satisfied with making himself president 
for life of Andea, la Torre had appointed himself head of the Andean 
delegation to the Convention so as 
to have a personal finger in the new 
constitutional pie. 

"Well," said Aguirre, "he is, as 
you know, a man of the utmost 
sense of. personal dignity. I — ah — 
sold him on this Space Clause, as 
you would express it, with the result 
that he has placed the Andean delegation squarely behind it and made 
speeches in its behalf. Now if the 
clause is not adopted he will feel 
that his honor has been insulted. 
And since he cannot take his feelings out on Carstairs-Brown and

the other skeptics, he will vent 
them on me." 

"What'll he do? Can you?" 

"If that were all! Did you not 
hear how he had fourteen political 
opponents shot without trial before 
taking off for this Convention?" 

"I probably did. So he's the guy 
who calls himself the great democratic liberator?" 

"Oh, but he is! Think of all the 
things that he has done for the 
masses- — free parades, extra holidays to hear his speeches, and all 
the rest! But these now-dead politicians were criticising him in public. Naturally he could not tolerate 
such insults to -his dignity, or the 
people would have doubted his 
virility and thrown him out. After 
all, one must remaip respected. But 
that, alas, will not save my neck." 

"Too bad," said Dagobert Heck. 
"You Andeans have certainly done 
all you could to put the clause 
across. Short of having a spaceship land with a load of little green 
men with tentacles — Hey!" Heck 
frowned into his drink. "That gives 
me an idea. There's an old friend 
of mine in India named Dick 
Nugent, used to work with me on 
the World-Telegram-Sun. He retired a few years ago to become a 
yogi. Maybe — Say, when does 
this clause come up for a final 
vote?" 

"Tomorrow, if the meeting goes 
according to schedule." 

Heck consulted his watch. "Excuse me. I think I can just make 
it." 

"Make what?" asked Aguirre. 
But Dagobert Heck had gone. 

Myron Kalish, the American 



Secretary of State, took his turn 
as president of the Convention the 
following noon. His bland exterior 
concealed a battalion of worries 
that would have floored a lesser 
man, the chief being that after all 
his toil and travail the Senate of 
the United States would insert a 
long sharp knife into his back by 
refusing to ratify the new Constitution. Already senators from the 
Middle West were talking ominously about "giving away the 
rights that our boys fought and died 
for at Valley Forge, Antietam, 
Chateau-Thierry, Midway, and 
Teheran. . ." • 



NEVERTHELESS Kalish prepared to call the meeting to 
order. With luck the Steering Committee should be able to wind the 
thing up in three more days. Most 
of the terms and clauses of the 
document had already been agreed 
upon. There remained only the 
controversial questions of what 
power if any the World Government should have over tariffs and 
immigration, and this silly Space 
Clause in which Juan de la Torre 
seemed so inexplicably interested. 
Kalish thought such a provision absurd, but did not wish to offend la 
Torre, who despite his domestic 
sins had brought the Andean Federation into the war on the side of 
the United States. 

Kalish was opening his mouth to 
speak when the sight of a messenger-boy hurrying down an aisle 
stopped him. It must be pretty 
urgent or the guards would never 
have let the boy through during the 
actual session. 



56 



L. SPRAGUE DE CAMP 



The boy walked up to the President's desk and handed a fistful of 
radiogram forms to Kalish, who 
said "Thank you" in an absentminded way and peered at the 
forms. The boy murmured "Bienvenu, monsieur," and walked off. 

Kalish swallowed as he read. 
The message was one long radiogram running over a half-dozen 
sheets. At last he laid down the 
message and spoke into the microphone : 

"The meeting will please come 
to order. The first item on today's 
agenda is the so-called Space 
Clause proposed by the delegation 
from the Andean Federation. It 
was planned to conclude arguments 
pro and contra this clause and vote 
on it this afternoon. However, 
news has just reached me which, if 
authenticated, has so great a bearing on the adoption of this clause 
that I think I should read it to you. 
It is a Reuters dispatch from Dar^ 
jeeling, India, and reads as follows : 

November fifth. An object described as a space-ship of extraterrestrial origin landed yesterday 
in eastern Nepal, near the Tibetan 
border in the vicinity of Kishanganj. First reports indicate that the 
beings who man the ship are green 
bipeds nine feet tall with tentacles 
for arms. Their intentions are said 
to be friendly. 

The arrival of a visitor from 
outer space is confirmed by a number of witnesses in Sikkim, over 
which the ship slowly passed while 
looking for a landing-place. In view 
of the enormous importance of this 
arrival, both as proving the longsurmised existence of intelligent 



extra-terrestrial life and as bearing 
upon the political organization of 
the world to deal with the problems posed by this fact, the government of Nepal has waived its usual 
prohibition against entry of foreigners into the country to permit qualified experts and officials of the 
Indian Government to investigate 
the visitors. As Prime Minister RajendrcLchandramohananath of Nepal expressed it in a tele phone -call 
to Darjeeling, "For the sake of God, 
sirs, let wise men be sent forthwith 
to cope with this appalling manifestation. We of Nepal are not 
qualified to do so." 

Pending the arrival of an official 
mission of the Indian Government 
to welcome the visitors in the name 
of the. peoples of the earth, Richard 
Nugent, a retired American journalist living in Darjeeling, has 
crossed the border into Nepal and 
struck out into the wild region 
where the ship is said to have come 
to earth — 



KALISH finished the radiogram, 
took off his glasses, and rubbed 
his eyes with his finger-tips. Then 
he said: 

"In view of the importance — -" 
Wilhelm Feuer, of the German 
delegation, was waving for attention. When recognized he said-. 

"This is all very impressive, Mr. 
President, but let us not by our 
emotions carried .away be. To me it 
seems that the coincidence of such 
a landing, just when the so-called 
Space Clause is under consideration, is simply too perfect to be believed. At least we should await 
confirmation to be sure that we are 



THE SPACE CLAUSE 



57 



not the victims of a hoax." 

' "As I was about to say," continued Kalish, "in view of the importance of this development, the 
chair will entertain a motion to defer action on this clause until this 
time tomorrow." 

The motion was made and carried, and for the rest of that session the Convention devoted itself 
to a long wrangle over tariffs. 

When the meeting adjourned, 
the members swarmed around the 
newsstand. By that time the newspapers bore not only the Reuters 
dispatch that Kalish had read, but 
a confirmatory Associated Press dispatch giving further information. 
Richard Nugent, it seemed, had 
radioed that he had reached the 
space-ship and met the aliens, who 
had brought an elaborate equipage 
of linguistic apparatus, picturebooks and the like, to enable them 
to get intb communication with 
the Terrans. Further information 
was promised soon. 

Mateo Marco Lope Aguirre Malaria glanced up from his newspaper with a smile of quiet triumph. 
It seemed to him that the other 
delegates were looking at each other with a new seriousness. When 
he had brought up the Space 
Clause, some had thought it ridiculous because there were no intelligent extra-terrestrials; others preferred to leave all nonessential controversies to the future, counting on 
amending the Constitution when 
and if civilized e. t.'s were discovered. Now that the delegates were 
faced with extra-terrestrial reality, 
the petty national disputes that had 
stirred up such high words and 
hard feelings seemed small. 



, Next morning the papers carried 
still more information. By working 
furiously Nugent had gotten into 
communication with the aliens. He 
announced that they were from a 
planet of the small star Ross 154. 
There was a blurry radiophotograph which Nugent had transmitted with his portable set to Darjeeling and which had then been 
re-transmitted around the world. It 
showed a bald man standing between two tall things that might 
have been a backward child's attempt to model a man in plasticene. 
The Indian party had already 
flown to Darjeeling and would take 
off the following day for the spaceship in a helicopter with a television 
camera. 

. At that afternoon's session, 
Aguirre braced himself for argument. But none came. In fact one 
of his bitterest critics, Jacob Atta 
of Nigeria, rose to say: 

"While I have been opposed to 
this clause in the past, the events of 
the last twenty-four hours have 
changed my mind, Even if the 
space-ship should turn out to be a 
hoax, I now think it advisable to 
have this clause in the Constitution, just in case." 

After a minor bicker over the 
meaning of the world "intercourse," the Convention adopted 
the Space Clause and went on to 
the rest of its business. There was 
little debate; everybody's mind was 
far away, in the rhinoceros-haunted 
wilds of Nepal. In fact the President (Bretkun of Lithuania) managed to get compromise proposals 
on tariffs and immigration adopted 
that afternoon, leaving nothing to 
do but make laudatory speeches 



58 



L SPRAGUE DE-CAMP 



until the Drafting Committee finished polishing and homogenizing 
the final draft. The Sheikh of Aden 
made a speech in Arabic, followed 
by speeches from delegates of 
Afghanistan, Albania, and Algeria, 
and then the meeting adjourned. 



AGUIRRE was relaxing in the 
bar when his glorious chie"f 
stalked in and rode up to him. 

"Aguirre," said la Torre, "we 
leave tomorrow. Are you ready?" 

"Carajo! Why, chief?" 

"I have received word that my 
enemies conspire against me, so I 
must get back to Andea at once." 

"But you will miss the final ratification!" 

"No; I have arranged it with 
Kalish and Carstairs-Brown. The 
Drafting Committee shall work all 
night and present the Constitution 
tomorrow morning to a special session. Then I will make my speech 
— Andea comes alphabetically after 
Algeria — and we shall rush to the 
airport as soon as I have finished. 
Get packed." 

"Yes, yes, chief, of course." 

And so it was done. 

La Torre's airplane was over 
Venezuela when the radio broke 
the news that the arrival of the 
extra-terrestrial space-ship had 
been a hoax after all, perpetrated 
by a group of journalists including 
Dagobert Heck and Richard Nugent. The announcer ended with a 
sardonic note: 

" — the delegates to the World 
Government Constitutional Convention are having a hearty laugh 
over the departing speech made this 



morning by Senor Juan de la Torre 
Baroja, in which he boasted in extravagant terms of his authorship 
of the Space Clause and claimed 
sole credit for any benefits that 
might accrue to the earth hereafter 
as a result of communication with 
other civilized planets. However, 
inquiries at the Convention indicated that there is no present intention of repealing the Space 
Clause, as this would require procedural complications, and since 
the clause is regarded as at worst a 
harmless piece of whimsy — " 

Aguirre became conscious of his 
chief's glittering black eyes. La 
Torre rasped: 

"So! My dignity has been insulted! And who is responsible? 
Who put me up to backing that accursed Space Clause, saying that 
it would rebound to the eternal 
fame and credit of the Andean Federation and its President, the people's choice, Juan Serafin de la 
Torre Baroja? Who led me astray 
and exposed me naked to the pitiless laughter of the world? Fool! 
Poltroon!" 

The President's voice rose to a 
scream as he added details of 
Aguirre's ancestry and love-life. He 
caught Aguirre by the lapels and 
shook the smaller man until the latter's teeth rattled. He slapped his 
face, forehand and backhand, a 
dozen times, then hurled the eminent jurist from him, shouting: 

"Guards! Tie up this filth until I 
can deal with him in a more appropriate manner!" 

In the prison, Aguirre stood on 
the trap with the rope around his 
neck. In one corner his wife and 



THE SPACE CLAUSE 



59 



his mistress sobbed quietly in each 
other's arms. In front of him stood 
la Torre with fists on well-padded 
hips, grinning ferociously. 

"Ha!" snarled the President. 
"So, you thought I should weaken 
and let you go for old times' sake? 
Have you ever known me to forget 
an insult to my dignity?" 

"No, sir," said Aguirre miserably. 
"If you are going to hang me, will 
you please get it over with?" 

"I will hang you when I am 
ready. I have had requests from 
many quarters, including the President of the United States himself, 
to let you off. I threw these impertinent requests back in their faces! 
I told them that if I heard any 
more such mush, I should refuse to 
ratify the Constitution! That is 
what I, Juan Serafin de la Torre 
Baroja, think of the rest of the 
world! Well, hangman, are you 
ready?" 

"Ready, chief," replied the hangman. 

La Torre gave the final command. The hangman did his duty. 
The wife and mistress screamed in 
perfect timing with the snap of the 
rope. Dr. Aguirre departed for 
happier climes. 

While the body still swung, an 
officer of the Federal Police hurried 
on the scene. He said, "Chief, you 



won't believe this, but — " 

"But what?" 

"The ambassador Mencias Mola 
is here with a visitor. This visitor is 
one of a group who arrived in 
Mexico a few hours ago. Senor 
Mencias flew this one here as fast 
as possible." 

La Torre gaped. The visitor 
blinked three of his seven eyes and 
extended a tentacle. La Torre took 
the tentacle in his right hand and 
shook it. 

The other four eyes of the visitor 
were trained upon the figure dangling on the scaffold, with — la 
Torre thought — a definite indication of curiosity. "Does he," la 
Torre asked the officer, "speak the 
language of my people?" 

"Oh yes. Very smart, these extraterrestials." 

"We have machines that teach 
quickly from your radio broadcasts," the e. t. said. "Ah — the suspended individual — " 

"A martyr to his country. A 
paragon of wisdom and loyalty. 
Even now I am planning a special 
medal for him." La Torre stepped 
close to the scaffold and peered upward through experienced eyes. "It 
will of course be awarded posthumously," he said with marked 
sadness. 



THE END 



"I'll give you the cure for the 
most horrible disease," Songeen 
said. "The sickness of life itself." Newlin replied, "Fine. But 
first, give me a couple of minutes 
to kill yoitr husband. Then we'll 
go on from there.

Shock Treatment 



By Stanley Mullen 



IN VENUSPORT, on paydaynight, it is difficult to tell for certain where the town leaves off and 
the pink elephants begin. It is difficult to tell about other things, too. 
Spud Newlin had heard that a man 
could sometimes get rich overnight 
just tending bar on such occasions, 



and he was putting the rumor to the 
test. Not many bartenders had 
lasted long enough to find out. 

The night had had a good start. 
Clock hands over the bar in the 
Spacebell registered 1:18 Venustime, and considering, things were 
almost dull at the moment. The 



The spolight meant violence and 
sudden death.

place had been jumping earlier, but 
hilarity had worn itself out, the 
dead had been removed and excitement dulled. No relatives or widows 
of the dead sportsmen had yet appeared; all corpses-elect had died 
clean, with the minimum of messy 
violence and, surprisingly, only 
three more -or less innocent bystanders had been burned down in 
the proceedings. After shattering 
uproar, such calm was disturbing. 
Newlin was actually getting bored. 
Then she came in — and he was no 
longer bored. But, perversely, he 
resented the surge of interest that 
ran through him at sight of this 
out-of-place girl. 

At a casual glance, she might 
seem ordinary, but Newlin was 
never superficial. Her kind of beauty was something to be sensed, not 
catalogued. It was part of the odd 
grace of movement, of the fine, 
angular features, of the curious 
emotion which dwelt upon them, 
sad and subdued. Even her costume 
was as out of place in the Spacebell 
as her mood; the dress was simply 
cut and expensive, but drab for the 
time and place. It clung about a 
slight, well-formed body in smoothly curved lines that seemed almost a 
part of her. Only her hands and eyes 
showed nervous tension. 

At first he thought her eyes were 
cold, but it was something racial 
rather than personal. He noticed 
that they were large and luminous 
— like moonstones — with a pearly 
opaque glimmer as if only upper 
layers colored and reflected light. 
In their depths was an odd effect, 
like metalflakes drifting through 
ribboned moonlight with abysses of 
deepest shadow beyond. There was 



pain, trouble, and sadness in them, 
and behind that, fear — a desperate 
fear. You thought of wailing, 
haunted moonlight, and of dreadful 
things fled from in dreams. 

Newlin's first thought was that 
she was one of the new-made 
widows, and was likely to be all too 
human about it. Later, when he had 
begun to doubt that she was allhuman, her physical charms still 
went inside him and turned like a 
dull knife. He was no morS immune 
to animal attraction than the next 
man, but in this particular woman 
there was something else even more 
intriguing and unpredictable. He 
felt a powerful impulse to do something to relieve her of that paralyzing supernatural dread. 

A situation pregnant with violence was working up at one of the 
gaming tables but Newlin wilfully 
tore his attention from the mounting tension between the fat Martian 
gambler and an ugly character from 
Ganymede. 

"Anything I can do for you, 
sister?" 

Her smile was strange, thoughtful, preoccupied. "Yes," she told 
him. "There is something you can 
do for me. Unless your question was 
purely professional. If so, forget it. 
I need something stronger than the 
— the liquors you serve here." 

Newlin grinned sourly. "You' 
don't know our drinks. One sip and 
a mouse snarls at a snow-leopard. 
The question was not purely professional. Not my profession, anyhow. I 
don't know about yours. Or do I?" 



H 



ER HEAD jerked on its slender 
stalk of neck. Pale eyes stared

63 



into his; her lips twisted in cold 
scorp. 

"I don't think you do. And I'll 
do without your help. Perhaps you'd 
better go back to polishing glassware." 

The rebuke failed to impress 
Newlin. He waited while her glance 
swung about the room, evaluating 
the place and its occupants in one 
quick sweep. Dissatisfied, she turned 
back to Newlin and again the 
moonstruck eyes probed and assessed him. 

"Take your pick," he said sharply. "But don't judge them by their 
clothes. On Venus, a man in ragged 
spaceleather may have heavy 
pockets. Now, take me — " 

"I was told I could find Spud 
Newlin here. Point Kim out and 
I'll pay your fee — " 

Newlin was suddenly cautious. 
"Yes, he's here — but what would a 
woman like you want with such a 
notorious — " 

"I'm asking questions, not answering," she said calmly. "And I'm 
well aware of his failings. I selected 
him because of his . . . his reputation. It's revolting, but even such a 
man may have uses. My requirements of him, and my reasons for 
the choice, I will discuss with him. 
No one else." 

"Free advice, sister. Forget it, 
and get out of here. He's no good. 
Particularly bad, for a choice morsel 
like you." 

"I'm used to making up my own 
mind. Where is he?" 

Newlin shrugged. "You win. I'm 
Newlin. You take it from there." 

Incredulity flooded her face and 
slowly drained away. "You! Yes, 
you could be Newlin. But you're 



working here. A famous man like 
you. Why?" 

Newlin laughed easily. "It's very 
simple. I need money. If I can last 
through till morning, I'll have it. 
Now I'll ask the questions. You 
answer them. What do you want? 
Why me?" 

A variety of expressions flowed 
over her mobile features. 

"But — you could leave?" she 
faltered. « 

"I could, but I won't. This isn't 
charity night, kid. So go home and 
come back another, time. Tomorrow." 

"Tomorrow won't do. Maybe I've 
chosen the wrong man, but there's 
no time for second chances. I 
wanted a man with courage, a man 
used to living dangerously and 
going his own way, a man who 
wouldn't ask questions and would 
do anything for money. You 
sounded like something out of the 
old books; a rogue; a rebel." 

Newlin sighed. Did it show so 
much? From the gutter that 
spawned him, he had fought and 
gouged and elbowed his way up. 
To him all men were enemies. As a 
spacebum, he had explored the raw, 
expanding frontiers as Man surged 
from planet to planet. As a hunted 
outlaw he had existed perilously on 
the twilight fringes of civilization. 
Ruthless and savage, a thief and 
despoiler, a criminal and adventurer, he had found his way back to 
Earth, Mars, Venus and wrested a 
niche of sorts within the citadels he 
had attempted to overthrow.! Despite the brittle amnesty, he knew 
that authority awaited only a single 
slip to deal with him according to 
their views. But in the bitterness 



64 



STANLEY MULLEN 



of ultimate disillusions, he had 
found the fountainhead as lacking 
in civilization and sanity as its furthest riples. He longed, now, only 
for the final gesture of rejection. 
Escape. . . . 

"I had expected more of Newlin," said the girl. 



HIS REPLY was a short, bitter 
laugh. "So had I. My character 
is as corrupt as the rest of mankind. 
Poverty is' undignified and degrading; it poisons virtue and debases 
the outlook. Without money a man 
cannot claim his birthright of freedom ; getting money he loses his independence and his character." 

"You think money would make 
you free?" the girl asked. . 

"Not of itself." Newlin scowled. 
"With money, a free man can be 
free; a slave with money is still a 
slave. Perhaps I want to learn for 
myself which I am. I want enough 
to pay for a spaceship, the best to be 
had. A one-man ship in which I can 
escape this madhouse and venture 
alone — beyond Pluto. Such a plan 
requires money, so I work in the 
Spacebell. Between wages, tips, 
graft and my winnings, I may have 
half enough, by dawn. If I live that 
long." 

The girl nodded, then spoke contemptuously, "I can pay very 
generously. You can set your own 
price. Enough even for your spaceship. But what do you expect to 
find— beyond Pluto?" 

"Myself, first. After that, who 
knows? This solar system is a vast 
pesthouse. I am contaminated by 
fools, moneygrubbers, sheep and the 
corrupt authorities that rule them. 



What else I find isn't important if 
I find myself. Even death." 

Newlin's eyes burned with a hot 
glare of fanaticism. Dread sprang 
into the girl's heart. Always with 
these people there was this fear, this 
panic-desire to escape, always an 
urge to destruction coupled with 
eery mysticism, compulsions, conflicts — and always the final delusion 
of personal sanity in the atmosphere 
of chaos. Some of Newlin's words 
found echo in herself, but she 
checked a momentary sympathy. 
The system was mad, true — but how 
sane was Newlin? How sane and 
trustworthy? He could be a dangerous tool in her unskilled, frightened 
hands. 

She had chosen him on the basis 
of his reputation. From his police 
record, and other documents. A 
capable man, courageous and selfreliant, ingenious, but a person of 
tensions and conflicts, a man of violence, unpredictable, torn by contradictory impulses, a savage but 
not without kindness and generosity. 
For her purposes, he might do as 
well as any other. At worst a man, 
cast in heroic mold. Quickly, but 
not without revulsions and reservations, she made fateful decision. 

"For a man of your talents," she 
said, "the task should be simple. I 
want you to break into a building 
and bring me something. There is 
danger you would not understand. 
If you fail, death for both of us. For 
success, you set the price. Are you 
interested?" 

Newlin laughed cynically. "You 
promise the moon if I can steal it 
for you, nothing if I can't?" 

"No such shrewd bargaining," 
the girl murmured uneasily. "But 



SHOCK TREATMENT 



65 



name the amount you hoped to 
make here. I will match it now — 
and double it if you accomplish my 
errand." 

"Fair enough," said Newlin. "But 
keep your money. I'll case the job 
first. Pay me later — if I don't 
change my mind again." 

Ducking behind the bar, he shed 
his apron and buzzed for the standin bartender. Ed Careld forsook his 
interminable game of Martian chess 
and appeared to take over. 

"Seems quiet," he said. "What's 
up?" 

"Nothing," Newlin told him. 
"Private business. I may not be 
back. Keep an eye on Table Three." 

Careld nodded, eyed the gamblers 
at Table Three dubiously. He tied 
his apron carefully and sidled toward the table to oversee the situation and clamp down a lid if necessary. Table Three picked that moment to erupt in profane violence. 
Three languages splashed pungently 
in dispute which passed quickly to a 
. climax of crisscrossed heat-beam 
brilliance. Marksmanship was poor; 
both the fat Martian and his adversary from Ganymede survived, and 
only two questionable kibitzers 
blazed into sudden oblivion. Careld 
swept up the corpses into neat piles 
of ash, then tried to warn the combatants against further displays of 
short temper. 



HE DIED in an outburst of majority resentment, punctuated by 
heat-beams. Newlin returned behind the counter and buzzed for 
Careld's stand-in. Then clutching 
the girl's arm, he left the place, 
dragging her along. 



The street was dim, silent, deserted. "Where to?" asked Newlin. 

Her quick nod indicated direc-* 
tion. 

"Walking distance?" he persisted. 
"Inside the city? If not, I'll have to 
get protection suits from a public 
locker." 

Just inside. Monta Park." 

Newlin whistled. "Nice neighborhood. Do you live there?" 

"No," she faltered. "I'm just in 
from— Earth." 

Earth! It was a long time since 
Newlin had seen Earth. Few of his 
memories were pleasantly nostalgic. 
Born there, in the poorest quarter of 
the international spaceport of 
Sahara City, his early life had been 
hard. Both parents had died there, 
broken from strain and poverty, and 
Newlin escaped only by stowing 
away in the dangerous after-holds 
of a rocketship bound for Mars, 
risking the unpleasant death from 
leaking radioactives in preference to 
being poor on Earth. 

He had been poor since, in many 
places, but never with the grinding 
hopelessness of those early nightmare years. Their mark stayed with 
him and colored his life. He knew 
every rathole of the system, with the 
same intimacy the rats knew them. 
Once, on a non-stop express rocket 
from Mars to Pluto, he had lost a 
finger and all the toes from his left 
foot in ceaseless guerilla warfare 
with rats which had disputed possession of the hold in which he 
stowed away. More than once he 
had bummed passage near the 
atomic fuel vats of cranky old spacefreighters that were mere tin cans 
caulked with chewing gum. As boy 
and man, he slept in jails from the 



66 



STANLEY MULLEN 



dark, mad moons of Neptune to the 
fiery beach-head colonies of Mercury. And with fists, brain and 
nimble fingers he had written an 
epic biography in Security Police 
annals. 

Like other cities of the space frontier, Venusport was raw and crude, 
exotically beautiful and cruelly violent. To Newlin it was old stuff, picturesque, with the spicy flavor of a 
perilous vacation spot. After abrasive years on a dozen planets and 
habitable moons, the ugly savageries 
of Venus had only a quaint charm. 
Survival was always comparatively 
easy there, and a man shed normal 
fears with the shredding, blistered 
skin of spaceburns. He was surprised 
when the girl shuddered and drew 
close to him. Her instinctive trust 
amused him, and he laughed brutally. The sound slashed between them 
like a chilled blade. 

They went together, in silence. 
Faint, flat breeze from the city's airconditioners fanned their faces. It 
was dark enough, and for Venus, 
reasonably cool. Buildings strewn 
like a careless giant's toys formed a 
vague and monstrous backdrop. 
Street-lighting was poor, for such 
luxuries are expensive and the city 
fathers cared little what happened 
to the poor, diseased, half-starved 
nonenities. All streets were crooked 
aimless alleys, all black and empty. 
Only near landing stages and spacefreight elevators was there any 
activity. Darkness and the Cyclopean setting gave more menace 
than intimacy to the dim tangles of 
avenues and parkways. 

The girl stopped, panting for 
breath. Newlin waited for her. 

"You're a fool to trust yourself 



alone with me in a place like this," 
he told her grimly. 

She hugged the loose mantle 
tightly across her shoulders and 
tried vainly to read his face in the 
murk. 

"If you're trying to frighten me, 
you're wasting time," she said "I 
have more important fears." 

Newlin chuckled. Skinny wench, 
but she had something. There was 
pride in her, and scorn, and a hot 
spark that burned through the tones 
of cold scorn. Something else, too. 
A hint of desperate courage that 
baffled him. 

"I still think you should have 
tried the panther sweat at the 
Spacebell," he suggested. "One sip 
and—" 

"I know," she snapped. "And I 
hope you've had yours for tonight. 
You'll need it. We're almost there^" 

"In that case, we'd better talk," 
he said curtly. "I still know nothing 
about you. Who you are, what you 
want? I don't even know your 
name." 

She spoke in low, vibrant tones, 
but the language seemed unfamiliar 
to her. She groped for exact words, 
extracted subtle meanings. But there 
was a hesitance, an uneasiness, 
about speech itself, as if she found it 
a tedious and inflexible medium for 
thought expressions. 

"I told you. In a — building, there 
is a man I must see. He does not 
wish to see me, and there are barriers I cannot pass. The building is 
a combination workshop and living 
quarters, and something else you 
would not understand. You must go 
inside for me and induce him to 
come out to me. My name is Songeen. Tell him that. He will know

67 



me, and perhaps he will come. But 
it has been so long—" 

Newlin grunted. "That man T 
must see. One who wouldn't come 
when you whistled. However long it 
has been?" 

"He has changed — greatly. He 
may be insane. He may be dangerous. In self-defense, it may be necessary for you to kill him. For your 
protection, -I have provided a 
weapon. Use all other means to persuade him first, but threaten if you 
have to. And be ready to kill if he 
attacks you. But dead or alive, bring 
him to me." 



SUDDENLY Newlin disliked his 
errand. Even more, he disliked 
himself. For a brittle moment, he 
was moved to turn bask, refuse to 
carry out a bargain he now regretted. Killing for pay, at the whim 
of a jealous or scorned woman, was 
too ugly even for his calloused 
morality. 

"Preferably dead?" he asked 
thinly. 

"Preferably alive," Songeen murmured. "You would not understand, of course. It is because I love 
him. He will not come, but he must 
have the chance. And I must send 
a stranger to kill him, because he 
has — forgotten." 

Newlin stiffened angrily. He was 
on the point of rejecting the girl and 
her project when a battery of lights 
moved toward them from the winding lanes of the Park. Too well he 
knew what they meant. 

As the wealthiest district of 
Venusport, Monta Park was smug, 
respectable, luxurious— and protected. Roving radio-patrols of Pro


tection Police — privately hired 
thugs — guarded its dwellers and 
their possessions. A prowling monocar slowed and maneuvered to cast 
a revealing spotlight on the loitering 
pair. Newlin, had he been alone, 
might have dodged into the dense 
shrubbery, but the girl knew better. 

Calmly she turned to face down 
the occupants of the PP car, and 
her haughty expression would have 
chilled the blood of any PP constable presumptuous enough to 
question her. Her attitude and the 
obvious richness of her clothing 
seemed to satisfy the patrol, for the 
beam swung briefly and hesitated on 
Newlin. He dropped behind her like 
a servant bodyguard and hoped his 
scuffed space-leather was not too 
noticeable. The beam held for seconds, then flicked out. Soundlessly 
the patrol car vanished. 

Neither spoke as the pair moved 
quickly into the precincts of the 
Park. As residence area, it was 
splashy; a series of interlocked 
estates rather than expensive mansions packed closely together. Each 
unit sat alone in sprawling, neatly 
sheared grounds, landscaped with 
flowering trees and set with the chill 
sophistication of statuary in gold, 
silver and platinum. Botanical 
splendors from exotic worlds rioted 
in orderly tangles of aromatic greenery, with sculpture of glass, marble 
and the noble metals glinting like 
pale ghosts against the darker 
masses. 

Shadows parted before them. 
Half-hidden among trees rose a 
slender spire, needle-shaped, tall as 
a tower, but unwindowed. For a 
dwelling, its design was curious, and 
the interior must consist of circular 



68 



STANLEY MULLEN 



rooms one above the other. At the 
base, an arched, oval aperture 
should have been the door, but 
neither handle nor keyhole showed 
on the flat, polished plate. 

"Here we are," the girl said needlessly, her voice soft as a hint of 
pain trembled in it. A tremor ran 
through her body as she thrust out 
two objects toward him. A key and 
a gun. 

"You will need these," she went 
on. "He will be in one of the upper 
rooms. His name is Genarion. Perhaps he will talk with you, especially 
if you surprise him. But remember, 
he is deadly. His scientific knowledge is a more frightful weapon 
than this. So do not hesitate to use 
violence." 

Newlin fumbled the gun into a 
pocket, fingered the key. It was slim 
as a needle and as smooth. Without 
comment, he stared at her as weariness and disgust strangled him. 

"Tell me your price," she said 
quickly, as if in haste to get words 
out before either could think too 
much. "I will pay — now." 

Shabby bargaining, he thought. 
But he would call her bluff and 
force her to back down. "Not 
money," he said savagely. "I don't 
kill for money. For a woman, yes. 
I want you." 

He expected anger, scorn, even 
hatred. She gasped and her face 
went pale and hard. Wilting under 
his glare, she nodded. 

"Yes, even that — if you wish. I 
have no choice." 

Newlin felt sick, empty. He no 
longer desired her, even if she were 
willing. He despised her and himself. But a bargain was still a bargain. He shrugged. 



Like an outsize toy, a child's 
model of a spaceship, the oddly 
graceful structure towered upward 
into arching darkness. Like her, it 
was slender, radiant, beautiful. Bitterly, he caught the girl, dragged 
her to him, felt her flesh yielding to 
him. She leaned and met his lips 
with hers. The kiss was cold and 
ugty as writhing snakes. Cold. Ugly. 
Alien. . . . 



THE KEY went in smoothly, did 
not turn. It must have been impregnated with magnetism. Somewhere electronic relays clicked 
switches faintly. The door was open, 
its movement indescribable in familiar terms. It neither slid, nor swung 
on hinges. There was no door, much 
as if a light had switched off. 

A rush of air came out. It had 
the high, sharp tang of ozone, and 
something unfamiliar. 

Newlin stood inside what was obviously an airlock valve. A door inside had opened soundlessly. 

He went on. Beyond the inner 
doorway was a large circular room. 
Its dimensions seemed far greater 
than Newlin would have guessed 
from the exterior of the building. 

This was no mere dwelling, no 
laboratory or workshop. It was a 
spaceship of radical design. Elfin 
stair-ladders spiralled up and down. 
The girders seemed impossibly delicate and fragile, as if their purpose 
was half-decoration, half-functional ; and stresses involved were unimportant. Such support framework 
was insane — in any kind of spaceship. It had the quality of fairyland 
architecture, a dream ship woven 
from the filaments of spiderwebs. 



SHOCK TREATMENT 



69 



But there was hidden strength, 
and truly functional design, as may 
be found in spiderwebs. Newlin was 
no engineer, but he sensed solidity 
and sound mathematics behind the 
toy structure's delicacy. 

The stair ladder supported him 
without vibration, without give or 
any feeling of insecurity. He 
climbed. 

Walls and the floor and ceiling 
bulkheads were rigid to his touch, 
supported his weight firmly, despite 
their eggshell-thin appearance of 
fragility. There were no corners; 
everything fused together seamlessly 
in smooth curves. Walls were selfluminous and oddly cool. 

The lower chambers were bare of 
all furnishing. Higher levels contained a hodge-podge of implements, all in the same light, strong 
formula of design. But none familiar, either as to material or their 
possible function. There were machines, but all too simple. Neither 
the bulk of atomic engines nor the 
intricate complexities inseparable 
from electric or combustion motors. 

Newlin was puzzled. 

He stopped to listen, feeling like 
an intruder into a strange world. 
The building, or spaceship, ached 
with silence. 

Another stairwell beckoned. He 
climbed, slowly, with increased caution. It would do no harm to have 
the gun in hand, ready. Where was 
the man who lived in such a place? 
And what sort of man could he be? 
What would he have in common 
with the frightened, haughty girl 
outside? The obvious explanation 
no longer satisfied. 

As Newlin ascended, another 
floor opened and widened to his 



vision. The stair-ladder ended here. 
It was the top floor. But this chamber seemed infinitely larger than the 
others. At first there was no sight of 
the man. Newlin stood alone in the 
center of a vast area. He did not 
seem indoors at all. 

Endless vistas extended to infinity in all directions. In all directions save one, in which stood a tall 
shadow. Newlin gasped. It was his 
shadow, detached, seemingly solid. 

Three-dimensional, it stood stock 
still. It moved when he moved. He 
gasped, then found the answer. By 
the shadow's echo of his movements, he could trace a vague outline of encirclement. 

The walls were a screen, a circle 
about the room upon which were 
cast pictures so perfect that the beholder had illusion of being surrounded by eery, exotic landscapes. 
The scenes were panoramic, all 
taken at the same angle, by the same 
camera, and so cunningly fused into 
a whole that the effect was beyond 
mere artifice. For a moment, Newlin had stood within the strange 
world, its crystalline forms and 
strange jeweled life as tri-dimensional and real as himself. 

It was a large screen, alive with 
light, alive with dancing, flickering 
figures. There was no visible projector, and the images were disturbingly solid and real. There was 
depth, without any perception of 
perspective. It was a reflection of 
reality, cast upon the plane of circling walls. 

Then a man stepped from the 
screen. He had been invisible, because the projected images had 
flowed and accommodated themselves to his metal-cloth smock. 



70 



STANLEY MULLEN 



For the moment, he had been part 
of the screen. 

Newlin could not tear his eyes 
from that glaring plane of illusion. 
Something about the glare played 
havoc with nerves, and a faint hint 
of diabolical sound tortured his 
brain. No such world could exist 
in a sane universe. Not even with 
its terrible and heartbreakingly 
poignant beauty. It was a vision of 
Hell, bright with impossible octaves 
of light, splendid with raging infernos of blinding color, some of 
it beyond the visible range of human sight. And there was sound, 
pouring in maddening floods, sound 
in nerve-shattering symphonies like 
the tinkling clatter of many Chinese 
windbells of glass, all pouring out 
cascades of brittle, crystalline uproar. 

Sound and light rose in storming 
crescendos, beyond sight and beyond hearing. They ranged into 
madness. 



NEWLIN screamed, tried to cover 
eyes and ears at once. He tried 
to run, but nerve-agony paralyzed 
movement. He was chained to the 
spot. 

Sound and color descended simultaneously into bearable range. 

He stared at the man he had 
come to see. He stared and the man 
stared back. 

"Genarion?" Newlin asked, his 
voice thin and vague among the 
tumultuous harmonies bursting 
from the screen. 

"Who are you that calls me by 
that name?" cried Genarion. He 
spoke in the same curious manner 
as the girl. He showed amazement, 



mixed with an ugly kind of terror. 
"You're not one of them!" 

"Them?" Newlin said, striving 
for sanity as sound and light swelled 
again. His brain reeled. "Songeen 
sent me — ■!" 

Speech itself was a supreme effort. 

Genarion was beyond speech. 
Tigerishly, he moved. He leaped 
upon Newlin and thrust him back. 
Newlin sprawled painfully, his back 
arched and twisted by invisible machinery. 

Genarion stood with a gun in his 
hand. Aiming hastily, he pressed 
trigger. The beam flashed and 
licked charred cloth and smoking 
leather from Newlin's sleeve. There 
was an odd jangle from the invisible 
machinery which gouged so tangibly into Newlin's body. 

Instinctively, Newlin fired. He 
did not bother to aim. For him, such 
a shot was point blank, impossible 
to miss. * 

Genarion staggered. Part of his 
body vaporized and hung in dazzling mist as the projected images of 
light played over it. 

Dazed, Newlin scrambled to his 
feet. He was sick. But the screen 
held him. He stared, hypnotized. 
Images jigged and flowed in constant, eery rhythms. They moved 
and melted and rearranged themselves in altered patterns, without 
ever losing their identities or the 
illusion of solidity. The scene was 
not part of Venus, or of any world 
Newlin had seen. He had seen every 
planet or moon in the Solar system. 
But this was different, alien, frightening. 

And the screen was not really a 
screen at all, for the body of 



SHOCK TREATMENT 



71 



Genarion, hideous in the distortion 
of death, lay halfway through its 
plane. And it was changing, subtly, 
as he watched. It was no longer 
even a man, totally unhuman, as 
alien as the world it lay partway in. 
The body flowed, molten, hideous. 

The screen was a surrealist painting, come alive, solid and real. , And 
the solid, physical body of Genarion 
was part of it. He was dead, but 
real. His alien form was a bridge 
between two worlds, and now dead, 
Genarion was alien to both of them. 

It was madness. The madness of 
the screen communicated itself to 
Newlin. Before his shocked eyes, 
Genarion's body began to steam and 
rise in a cloud of vaporous, glittering crystals. Swiftly the haze dissipated. It was gone, gone invisibly 
into the alien world. Whatever 
Newlin had killed, it was not human, not a man. 

Newlin turned and fled down the 
fairy stair-ladder. 

He went through the still-open 
airlock doors and out into the 
screaming night. Behind him alarms 
were ringing frantically. Now they 
would be ringing in the stations of 
the Protection Police and call orders 
would go out to the radio-equipped 
prowl cars. Police would converge 
swiftly. 

Sound shattered the night stillness. From far away, coming closer, 
was the shrill wail of a siren. Other 
sirens. 

There was a harsh bleat of police 
whistles, near at hand. Newlin's 
imagination quivered with the possibility of blaster beams thrusting at 
his back. He fled. 

The alarms had burst into sound 
too quickly. Had the girl set the 



police on him, waiting only long 
enough to make sure he would accomplish his mission? 

Whatever he had been set to kill, 
had not been human. Not a man. 
Intuitively, Newlin realized that the 
girl had anticipated everything. She 
knew what would happen, he reflected bitterly. She had promised 
payment only on delivery ' of a 
corpse, when there could be no 
corpse. 

Spud Newlin, Sucker No. 1. 

Conscience did not trouble him. 
After all, the man — or the thing — 
had fired first, without warning, 
without waiting to hear him out. 
Without waiting for details like 
identity, or even asking to hear the 
message he brought. It was selfdefense, in a peculiar way. 



N 



EWLIN ran and tried to lose 

himself in the shadowy fastness 
of Monta Park. He was not surprised that the girl had not troubled 
to wait and meet him. 

He was not even angry. It was 
part of the game. 

The Protection Police radios were 
carrying the alarm. Soon the Security Police would take up the hunt. 
If the girl had turned him in, she 
would be able to give a detailed 
and accurate description. Newlin 
guessed that he would be lucky to 
last even the few hours till daylight 
—or what passes for daylight on 
cloud-shrouded Venus. 

Long before then, his career 
might end suddenly in a wild network of blaster or heat beams. By 
dawn he would very likely be crumpled among the ashcans and refuse 
in any dark alley. 



72 



STANLEY MULLEN 



But still the city would be his best 
bet. No use beating his way to the 
spaceport landing stages. Space 
Patrol units must have been notified, and would already be searching all outgoing units. 

For the moment, he had a brief 
interval of grace in which to think 
things over and try, if only for his 
own satisfaction, to figure out what 
had happened. It — whatever it was 
— had writhed hideously when the 
blaster beam drove home. Part of it 
vaporized instantly, and the organs 
revealed did not even look animal.. 
Eery, geometric, but riot the naked 
electronic symmetries of a mechanical robot. Not metal. But what? 
Collapsed like wet sacking, it had 
lain half-inside and half -outside the 
screen. He could not recall clearly 
its rapid mutations of form after 
that. 

Did it matter? The alarms were 
out. Blaring metallic clangor, and 
the uncanny banshee wailing of the 
hunting sirens. Police care little who 
is murdered in the nameless dives of 
Venusport, but let one of the lordly . 
rich men die, and all Hell is loosed 
on the killer. 

If the girl had turned in the 
alarm, it was only a matter of time. 
They would have his name and 
number; his ident-card would be 
listed and reproduced, sent everywhere. They would probably have 
the robot trackers out, those hideous 
electronic bloodhounds which can 
unerringly sort out a man's trail 
from the infinity of other scents and 
markings, following not smell, but a 
curious tangle of electrical impulses 
left by his body like static electricity 
or intangible magnetism. No layman could even guess how such a 



robot worked, but fugitives had 
learned to dread its infallible tracking ability. 

Newlin fled, and as he went, he 
cursed himself for getting involved 
in such a nightmare. 

Figures moved and blundered 
about him in the darkness of the 
park, but none got in his way. None 
seemed to notice him. Since it was 
not a man he had killed, perhaps 
others hunted him; other remote, 
alien beings he could riot see, or 
sense. 

The girl would know, of course. 
If he could find her. But she had 
vanished before he ever issued from 
the strange tower, and it was highly 
unlikely that he would ever see her 
again. 

Chance, and a sudden rush of 
blue-clad figures across a street 
ahead of him, turned Newlin back 
toward his own, familiar part of 
town. The scant shelter of shadows 
in deserted alleyways was a comfort, 
but little real protection. He had 
friends, of a peculiar sort, in the old 
native quarter, and the Spacebell 
lay just outside the fringe of the 
mutants' district, where the halfhuman natives laired up. These 
friends might hide him, for a 
while, although such refuge was of 
little use against the robot-trackers. 

By daylight, he could be smuggled outside the domed city, and 
once into the wastelands, there was 
a chance. Not a good one; but 
there, even the robot-tracker could 
hardly come upon him without his 
knowledge. A lucky blaster shot 
would leave a blank trail and a 
shattered robot for his pursuers to 
follow. He wondered if they would 
risk another such expensive ma

73 



chine merely to hunt down a murderer in the wastelands. Scarcely, 
when the wastelands would kill the 
fugitive sooner or later anyhow. 
. His first task was to reach the 
Spacebell and collect his pay. Then 
to get protection-armor, against 
the peril of sandstorms and the 
radioactive sinks that spot the old 
sea-beds outside Venusport. After 
that, the native quarter, if he lived 
to reach it. 

Shortly before daylight, he turned 
the last alley-corner and came in 
sight of the Spacebell. 

A shadow stirred with movement. 
A lithe, loosely draped figure hurried to meet him. It was the girl— 
Songeen. 

"Don't go in there," she said. 
"They know who you are, and the 
police are waiting for you." 

Newlin felt numb all over. "How 
did they know? Did you tell them?" 
he snapped. 

"Of course not. Don't be a fool. 
Would I inform, then wait to warn 
you? I did not know he had automatic alarms, and automatic 
cameras to make records of anyone 
who came into the — the place. It 
was the pictures. They were identified with your ident-card at the 
Central Police Bureau. And the 
robot-trackers are out." 



NEWLIN and Songeen studied 
each other for a long moment of 
silence. 

"I guess it doesn't matter now," 
Newlin said finally, "but I'm glad 
you didn't turn me in. I might almost as well give up and get the 
thing over with. There's no place 
to run. Not without money." 



Songeen produced a small sack of 
platinum coins which jingled as she 
offered it. 

"That's one reason I tried to find 
you. After the alarms, I knew I 
would only handicap your flight. I 
hid. Then I came here, because I 
thought you might come back. I'm 
sorry I have no more money, but 
the rest is all in credits. It would 
be no help to you in the wastelands." 

"I see," muttered Newlin. "Why 
did you care? Were you afraid I'd 
talk if the Police caught me?" 

Songeen shrugged coldly. "No, 
I hadn't thought of that. But I 
think I owe you something. Murderer's wages. I knew you couldn't 
fulfil your bargain when you made 
it. But, in a way, I am responsible 
for you." 

"In a way," agreed Newlin bitterly. He snatched at the bag of 
coins. "This will do. Thanks for 
nothing." 

"Don't blame me too much. I 
had no choice, and I did not know 
it would work out like this." 

"Perhaps not, but next time do 
your own killing. It's rough on both 
your victims." 

Songeen was crying, tearless 
wracking sobs that shook her frail 
body. 

"I'm sorry," she moaned. "But I 
couldn't even get in to see him. He 
knew the exact vibration level of 
my body, and had set supersonic 
traps to kill me if I tried to enter. 
Even my bones would have shattered. I would have died painfully 
and horribly. I would rather have 
died myself than cause his death. 
Believe that. There is always a third 
victim. He was my husband, and I 



74 



STANLEY MULLEN 



loved him. You can't understand, of 
course — " 

"I understand less than ever 
now." Newlin knew that it was 
madness to remain so close to the 
Spacebell. But he could not force 
himself to leave Songeen. She 
seemed near collapse. 

A thought struck him. "Say, is 
there anything there to tie you up 
with this business?" 

Songeen gave a wry thrust of her 
thin shoulders. "Much — but does it 
matter? It was my— our home. Before he tricked me outside and 
would not let me return. They don't 
know what happened — yet. But 
there will be enough evidence 
against both of us. Part of what you 
saw was illusion. His body is still 
there. Changed — but the trackers 
can identify it. The charge is murder, and they will want both of us. 
Not just you." 

"Come with me." Newlin spoke 
harshly— sharply. 

The girl's eyes flickered. "Are you 
threatening me?" 

"No. It's just that I've led them 
to you. We're in the same boat now. 
With the mechanical hounds on our 
heels. They will connect you 
through me, now that our trails 
have crossed. And they'll follow 
both of us. How will you manage?" 

Songeen smiled wearily. "One always takes risks. I- came here prepared for— anything." • 

"Don't be a fool! Protection Police don't stop to ask questions. 
They're hired Killers." 

"I suppose not. What do you 
suggest?" 

"Run and hide. Come with me, 
if you like. But suit yourself. I'm 
getting out of here. Out into the 



wastelands. It's almost dawn now. 
In the city, we're lost. Outside, 
there's a chance. A poor one, 
but—" 

Light was that gray ugliness that 
precedes the smeary glare of dawn 
on Venus. The girl seemed very 
slight and young and helpless. 
Again, Newlin felt that impulse to 
save and protect her. He could see 
no details of feature, even her face 
was shadowed, and not quite human; but her body was beautiful, 
and trembling. 

"Are you coming?" he asked, 
savagely. 

"I'll go with you ? " she said. 
"You're kind. Perhaps I can help 
you. If they corner us, please kill 
me. I don't like — being hurt." 

Newlin laughed grimly. "It's a 
promise. But I'll kill some of them 
first." 

"Please," she begged. "No killing. 
— not for me." 



TEN HOURS later, far out in the 
wastelands, Spud Newlin called 
a halt. The girl had trudged wearily 
behind him, uncomplaining and 
with patient determination. They 
wasted no precious breath in words, 
and walking had been doubly dirfi-; 
cult for her. The protection armor 
was twice too large, and very cumbersome for such a slight figure ; but 
such garments never come in halfsize. Children and women are forbidden to venture into the wastelands, except in special vehicles. 

Actually they had started out by 
vehicle. But it was old, cranky and 
ready for the junkyard. In the first 
flurry of sandstorm, it had clogged, 
burned out and died. Nothing very 



SHOCK TREATMENT 



75 



reliable was available in the black 
market without more notice. 

, Newlin accepted the inevitable 
and proceeded on foot. Perhaps 
they could reach the Archaeological 
Station at Sansurra. He was not certain if it would be inhabited at the 
Sandstorm season, but there was a 
good chance of stored food and 
water. Turning back to Venusport 
was impossible. So they went on. 

Now he was confused. Directions 
are difficult at best on Venus, and 
his radio-compass proved faulty. He 
had only the vaguest idea where 
they were, and none at all where 
they were headed. But if he-stopped 
too long, the shifting dunes would 
cover them. And if they tried to go 
too fast,«*t would be fatally easy to 
blunder into one of the open sinkholes of molten, radioactive metal. 

He stopped and motioned the girl 
to rest. 

She sank down, exhausted. 

Newlin adjusted the throat 
microphones and headsets in their 
plastic helmets to make for easier 
conversation. But for a while, 
neither could talk. They sat and 
gasped, yearning for a breath of 
fresh, unreclaimed air. Water supplies were low, and already Newlin 
had established iron rations. Drinking by tubes was difficult in the helmets and the water was warm and 
foul. 

"You're lost?" Songeen asked at 
last. 

Newlin nodded. He produced a 
wrinkled, battered map. "I can't 
even trust the compass. I don't t 
know where we are." 

The girl took the map in her 
gloved hands and peered intently 
through her face-mask. One finger 



traced a tiny circle in the film of 
dust. 

"I know," she said. "We are 
somewhere about here. And over 
there — " she indicated a direction 
behind Newlin — "is the city from 
which my people came." 

Newlin was startled. The directional instinct with which all 
Venusians are endowed was familiar enough, yet he would have 
sworn the girl was not from the 
enfeebled and mutant races of the 
veiled planet. She was, at once, 
more human — and more remote. 
Songeen guessed his doubt. 
Through the fused quartz faceplate, her angular features wore a 
curious, faint smile. 

"No, not Venusian. This was an 
— an outpost. A colony and a 
quarantine station. The city was 
abandoned long ago. Long before 
the atomic holocaust my people 
fled. Eons have passed. Everything 
is now in ruins — if even ruins remain. See, it is not marked on the 
map. Not even as ruins. But we 
have unusual race-memory. I can 
see the fabulous towers and arsenals, 
the terraced gardens and the palaces 
— as if they still stood today as they 
were in that vanished yesterday. 
And we have the homing instinct. It 
was my people who gave it to the 
Venusians. The one thing of value 
that still remains to them." 

Newlin was still dubious. "Unless 
you're dreaming." 

Her finger jabbed at the map. 
"We are here," she insisted. "And if 
you care to search and dig, the city 
is probably still there, as it was a 
million years ago." 

"Would there be water in your 
ruined city?" Newlin asked. 



76 



STANLEY MULLEN 



"Who knows? The wells are 
probably all filled with sand now. 
Or gone dry, or become contaminated. There is always much radioactivity near the ruined cities. They 
were primary targets when the peoples of Venus destroyed themselves. 
Even this desert is mute evidence of 
the holocaust; if one needs evidence. My people fled before that 
madness, because they anticipated 
it." 

Newlin snorted. The pre-holocaust Venusians were purely legendary. No written records could exist, 
amid such conditions as must have 
followed the ancient wars. Science 
knew that at least half a million 
years had passed since Venus was a 
fair green planet peopled with 
hearty, beautiful, ease-loving races. 
Half a million years since the surface people had even looked upon 
the sun. 

"If you're right about where we 
are," Newlin growled, "I'm still interested in that city. We can never 
make Sansurra with the water we 
have. Ruined or not, there may be 
wells. Is there a chance?" 

"Not a good one," Songeen replied. "Bufbetter than none." 

"Whenever you're ready," Newlin said. "You lead." 

Wearily, man and girl struck off 
across the seas of shifting sand. 
Great dunes blocked^ their way. 
Some they circled, others must be 
climbed laboriously. 



FROM the top of a huge, windribbed billow, Newlin stared at 
a pale flickering in the dust ahead. 
In all other directions stretched 
endless humps and hollows. But 



before him lay a great wind-scoured 
hollow of bare rock. Beyond that, 
crowning a series of low hills, which 
must have thrust above water line in 
this shallow part of the ancient, 
.vanished sea, were ruins. 

Even as ruins,, the city was spectacular. Massive columns had 
eroded slowly into stone toothpicks. 
Walls crumbled into formless heaps 
resembling the dunes. A few outlines of smoothed blocks and shattered lintels huddled the ground, 
half hidden by the encroaching 
sand. Details had vanished eons 
ago, but something still remained 
to tantalize imagination. The few 
buildings that still stood, and the 
soaring, fragile towers evidenced an 
engineering civilization of* staggering proportions. Surface dimensions 
were still tremendous, and the city 
itself must have been of first importance, covering hundreds of square 
miles. 

"Our city," said Songeen. 

Newlin glanced quickly behind. 
Still distant, but moving very rapidly was the string of dark objects 
that could only be sandsleds of the 
pursuit. One tiny figure, scarcely 
visible, was far in advance of the 
others. The robot tracker. 

He gestured. "They're covering 
three miles to our one," he told her 
grimly. "We'll try to reach the city 
before they catch up with us. Perhaps we can hide out among the 
ruins, and — with luck, booby-trap 
the tracker. If there's water, we can 
hold out for quite a while." 

Songeen nodded crisply. Her 
voice was strained with emotion 
and fatigue. "As fugitives my people 
abandoned this city. Now, as a 
fugitive, I return."

Then she was off, running awkwardly, the cumbersome suiting of 
her protection armor giving her 
bounding strides the laughable appearance of a lumbering teddy-bear. 

Descent into the hollow was riding a series of miniature sand avalanches. Each step buried the foot 
deep, but the sand gave way and 
slipped in loose spills. His bodts 
struck hard on rough, bare rock. He 
grunted, fought for balance, then 
sprawled heavily. She helped him 
up, then took off again. Newlin followed. 

Over the wind-carved rock, they 
made good time. Ascent of the long, 
jagged slopes to the city was heartkilling work, delicate and treacherous. The surface was like 
sponge-glass, brittle and deadly with 
knife-edges when broken. 

Sheltering from wind-driven sand 
under the cover of a great monolith, 
Newlin and Songeen watched the 
racing figures of pursuit top the 
crest of the opposite ridge and Start 
down. Man and girl were too 
winded and weak even to get up. 
They dared rest only a moment, 
then plunged on into the maze of 
tumbled ruins. Ultimate exertion 
had taken toll of their energies and 
rapidly burned up air reserves. Both 
were cruelly thirsty. The heat, even 
inside their insulated suits, was stifling. 

There was no time to take stock 
of manifold discomforts. 

The race was neck and neck. 
Death sniffed at their heels in the 
guise of mechanical trackers. On 
Venus, life is to the swift and cunning. To Newlin, life was perilous, 
but sweet. 

Their helmet microphones picked 



up and amplified a curious droning 
buzz. 1 It was the deathsong of the 
electronic tracker and it seemed 
closer than it was. 

Slowly, inexorably, it grew louder. Sound swelled steadily, and it 
was a whiplash to their flagging 
energies. They fled in panic through 
the streets of the dead city. 

It was no real refuge to them, 
but its megalithic precincts gave 
some lying illusion of safety. They 
chose a twisting, tangled route into 
the very heart of the ruined city, 
with the instinct of a hunted animal 
to confuse its trail. They doubled 
back to cross their own trail twice, 
in the vain hope of baffling the electronic enemy. 

Newlin had been hunted before, 
on Mars, but by live bloodhounds. 
Pepper, oil of mustard, and perfumes had saved him then. But this 
hound followed not scent, but something intangible, electrical,- and as 
mysterious as the soul-aura itself. It 
sorted two life-complexes from all 
other impulses and followed its own 
prime-directive — hunt down and 
kill. 

The end was inevitable as death. 



NEWLIN laid ambush for the 
mechanical monster. Crouched 
in a nest of rubble, he waited for it, 
blaster gun ready. Around a corner 
of shattered stones, it appeared. It 
moved like a whipping shadow, like 
part of the gathering twilight. 

Silent, save for the high, nervetearing drone, it came warily across 
the courtyard paved with eroded 
stone. It was low, not animal in appearance, with the form of a fat, 
ugly snake. Fading light of the 



78 



STANLEY MULLEN 



Venusian day cast a glint of metallic 
gray from its scaling of interlocked 
rings. 

Newlin waited for a close shot. 
How vulnerable was such a soulless, mechanical monster to even 
the shattering-heat-forces of a 
blaster gun? 

Songeen lay quietly beside him, 
her body quivering as much from 
strained muscles as from fear. Behind the face-mask, her thin features were pale, ghostlike. 

With elaborate caution, the 
tracker circled their hiding place. 
Its froglike head, with a ruff of exposed filaments lifted, like an animal scenting blood. It edged slowly 
closer, its movement a glide, sinuous, crafty, with no suggestion of 
mechanical action. 

Newlin pushed the girl's form 
roughly away, lest her trembling 
foul his aim. Sighting, he pressed 
trigger. Bright flame leaped from 
the weapon, crackling. 

The beam lashed at the tracker, 
which stopped suddenly, threw back 
its monstrous head, and burst into 
hideous uproar of sparking, electrical discharge. Like a live thing, 
it twitched, jerked, and flung itself 
in mad spasms. Convulsions stopped 
as short-circuits flared in both head 
and body. Molten, flowing, its 
metallic carcass glowed eerily in the 
dimness. Dying, it blazed up in 
a fireworks display' spectacular 
enough to attract half of Venus to 
the terrified fugitives. 

But the drone continued. 

From behind the same corner 
came a duplicate of the first metal 
monster. Another tracker. 

Its drone rose into shrill crescendo. Like a dog, it approached the 



wreckage of its fellow. And like a 
dog, it summoned help. Then, without pausing to examine the mechanical casualty, it turned its electronic attentions back to the hunted. 
Hopelessly, Newlin urged Songeen to her feet. They fled, and the 
game began all over again. 



IT WAS a madman's dream. Desperate flight, the haunted ruins of 
an unknown city, deadly pursuit 
closing in, slowly, patiently inevitably. The familiar hare and hounds 
pattern of nightmare. 

They fled through vague, littered 
streets, treacherous with the rubble 
of lost centuries. Buildings were 
lighter patterns upon the gathering 
darkness. Stone flagging underfoot 
was rough, eroded, rotten. 

A pinnacled precipice rose suddenly to bar their way. Immense, 
sheer, buttressed by spills of loose 
rock, it towered above them and lost 
its heights in gloom. 

Within a massive, deep-carved 
archway of stone, set an oval of polished red granite. A doorway, barren of carving save for one, scrawled 
and monstrous hieroglyph. Uneasiness stirred in Newlin, for something in his buried race-memories 
recalled that symbol with supernal 
dread. Ice formed about his spine 
and melted in trickling terror-drops. 
Instinct cringed, but his conscious 
mind rebelled at even the effort of 
memory. 

Songeen stopped and stared at 
the hideously marked doorway, as if 
tranced. 

"I remember this place," she said 
in swift excitement. "But I had 
thought it vanished — eons ago." 



SHOCK TREATMENT 



79 



Newlin swerved on her angrily. 
"This is no time for experiments 
with your subconscious," he 
growled, savage with strain. 

"It is — sanctuary," she replied 
softly. "Come!" 

Boldly she stood before the oval 
door. Her finger traced its complex 
symbol, and the symbol responded 
with a glow like moonfire. 

Again, as it had been with that 
oval door in Monta Park, there was 
baffling suggestion of unmechanical 
movement. 

The stone block did not slide, 
roll, or swing open. It gave a slight 
quiver and dissolved. 

Songeen stepped through its aperture and the inner darkness of the 
building claimed her. Reluctantly, 
Newlin followed — caught as much 
by curiosity as driven by the yelping 
spectres of pursuit. 

No light entered the building 
from any source. It was dark as the 
pits of Ganymede or the under-surface laboratories of Pluto. It was 
dense and tangible as a block of 
black crystal. Newlin could see 
nothing, not even Songeen. And 
there was an alien feel to the interior. 

He was aware that Songeen operated some hidden mechanism, and 
that the door, though he could not 
see it, was replaced. 

"Now, for the moment, we are 
safe," she said slowly. "They cannot enter here." 

Newlin shrugged bitterly. "It's all 
one. They can't enter and we don't 
dare go out. So we stay here and die 
of thirst. If you were really a toprung witch, you'd think of details 
like air, food and water." 

Songeen's laugh was a ripple of 



eery crystal in the darkness. 

"How did you guess I was a 
witch?" she asked whimsically. 
"But we need not die here. Not unless you prefer to die among surroundings familiar to you. There is 
another way out. If we dare take it. 
For me, it will be simple. For 
you — " 

"Not so simple, eh? You paint an 
interesting picture. Like one I once 
saw on Mars, in the Gneiss Gallery. 
'Nocturne — yenusport,' it was 
titled. Beautiful. Dark purple background, the city seemed like fountains of flowering stars. It's not like 
that, not from the places I've seen 
it. Filth and dirt, people dying from 
poverty, disease or violence. Just a 
comparison. How close does your 
picture match the reality?" 

"Close enough. You're a strange 
man, full of contradictions. I think 
you're only slightly mad. But for 
anyone, the way I could take you 
would be difficult. The pathway 
leads to my own world. To you — or 
anyone, not native — it will seem 
madness. Something of it you saw 
in the tower." 

Around him in the darkness, he 
was conscious of her swift movements. She seemed untroubled by 
the lack of light. Neither by vision 
or hearing could he distinguish anything, but he sensed activity. 

Then, suddenly, as if she had uncovered a cache of implements and 
struck a fire, radiance spread 
around her. Its source was not 
definite, and it spread slowly, like a 
stain through water. But something 
illuminated a vast, vaulted interior, 
Gothic in a sense, with a churchlike air of gloom and mystery. It 
was Gothic, but of spiderweb deli

cacy, soaring arches, vague fretted 
ceilings, walls intricately carved into 
lacework of stone. Everywhere were 
echoes of that same eery symbolism 
in the door hieroglyph, and Newlin's folk-memories were oddly disturbed. 



HE COULD not place the feeling. 
Certainly none of the symbols 
bore even slight resemblance to any 
written language known to him. 

Something about their intricacy 
clouded even clear perception, and 
the emotional effect was not religious in any sense — it was stark, 
abysmal fear, as if the mysteries behind such symbols were too great 
for humanity to bear. 

Ignoring him, Songeen persisted 
at her curious tasks. Newlin went 
and stood beside her, watching. 

With gloved hand, she appeared 
to be tracing out some maze of deep 
cut markings that figured what 
must have been an altar-fane. 

"Do you expect any results from 
this ritual mumbo-jumbo?" he questioned irritably. 

Songeen looked up, startled. "Not 
more ritual than any other mathematics," she chided. "This is no 
temple, as you seem to imagine. It 
is the old quarantine station. I seek 
a doorway, but not into a hidden 
passage. There are other doorways. 
This one leads between dimensions. 
My world exists in a different plane,At least, our pathway to it follows 
strange ways, that you could never 
understand. You are no scientist or 
scholar. How could you grasp such 
unknown and forgotten matters? 
How could anyone in your world?" 

Newlin stared at her, seeing 



things he had only guessed before. 

"You are — alien" he said. 

"You can't,guess how alien," she 
answered. "I said I was not of Venusian stock. My people came from 
outside. Our world exists in the 
same plane as yours, a planet circling one of the nearer stars. This 
place was never our home, but we 
had colonies on Venus, Earth, Mars 
and one of Jupiter's moons. Other 
colonies — like this one— and observatories and quarantine stations. 
Our scientific observers and the 
medical staff stayed here. They 
studied and recorded and treated. 

"We were nqt gods nor demons 
nor anything else supernatural. Just 
a people not human, but not too 
remote from humanity. Just emissaries and workers, students and 
doctors. You might call us elder 
brothers to the human race. We 
came not to conquer, enslave and 
exploit, but to help. Sometimes the 
Masters came with us, since they 
were interested In our work. 

"Many times, by our guidance, 
human beings reached high levels 
of development in the arts and 
sciences. We taught them and guided their stumbling steps, and released to them such knowledge as 
we dared trust to them. Time and 
again, we raised them from the 
slime, only to have them fall back. 
There is fatal disease in the race, a 
disease of instability and cruelty 
and violence. Call it madness— insanity — in the technical sense. It is 
pathological, and the disease is 
common to the human race, in all 
its ramifications. The Solar System 
is mad, and all who dwell in it are 
lunatics. Dangerous and homicidal 
lunatics. Sol's system is the asylum

and pesthouse of oui» galaxy. We — 
my people — are its keepers and doctors. 

"We are charged with the care 
and treatment of an ailing form of 
life. Because of our near likeness, in 
form and thought, it was hoped that 
we could understand and help 
them: in time, perhaps, find a cure. 
There are other races inhabiting the 
galaxy — many of them, civilized, intelligent, living, and sometimes even 
of matter similar to ours. Their 
minds and bodies are too different. 
We are nearest, both in form and 
feeling. 

"We have tried, patieritly and 
hopefully. For the most part, it is 
a long history of frustration and 
failure. The corruption is too deep, 
too basic. It is part of the life-pattern of the race. Some individuals 
may rise above it, but its taint lies 
dormant even in them. At best, they 
are carriers. And there seems little 
future for such a race. 

"Your galactic neighbprs have 
been patient. But now a time of decision is near. Your ships explore, 
exploit at will within your system. 
You have pushed your limits to the 
furthest expansion of that system. 
Colonized and despoiled. Now, you 
stand at the expanding horizon of 
stellar flight. Other star-systems 
tempt your imaginations, and technology batters at the problems involved. 

"Your neighbors are watching, 
and afraid. If your people burst 
outside the limits of Sol's system, 
the contagion of your madness will 
spread and engulf the galaxy. At 
our request, they have given time, 
granting extensions freely. For 
countless centuries we have tried, 



and our effort, all our work and 
thought, has led only to failure. 
Now, the others have set a time 
limit, and the deadline is very close. 
Very close. You are all living on 
borrowed time; and but for our 
pleadings, it would be still less. 

"The masters often send emissaries to us, as we send ours to the 
planets of Sol. They help and advise 
us — not as superior beings or as 
gods, commanding — but as elder 
brothers, trying to share their wisdom, trying 'tq. help and guide us. 
They only help and advise, never 
intervene unless asked. Their advice 
is wisdom — sometimes terrible, 
difficult to understand, painful to 
accept. Recently, they brought a 
message from the other peoples — a 
message and ultimatum. And the 
Masters advised us to accept failure, 
to let them destroy humanity as a 
blot on the galaxy. We begged one 
more chance, a last, desperate gamble, probably foredoomed to failure. 
But they granted us the painful 
right of the doctor. We can operate, 
but if the patient dies, "so do we. 
That was our choice." 



AS SHE talked, Songeen had engaged herself busily with the 
queerly formal operations of tracing 
the intricate diagrams. 

"Do you believe me?" she asked, 
looking up. 

"I'm not sure," Newlin replied 
frankly. "Are these Masters your 
gods?" 

"Not gods. Living, intelligent beings, civilized, but not like us. Not 
material. I cannot explain. Even 
they are but advisers and messengers. Not all-wise, nor all-powerful. 



82 

I wish they were; for they are 
kind." 

"You sound like nice people," 
Newlin admitted. "I wish I could 
believe you. Off-hand, I think 
you're crazy. You say we're all off 
the beam. Then you talk like delusions of grandeur, and I have reason to know you can be homicidal. 
One of us is nuts. It's a toss-up." 

Songeen smiled wearily. "It is 
possible that I am infected. I am 
inoculated against it, but so was 
Genarion. Will you believe that I 
loved him? He was my husband. 
We were children together, like 
brother and sister. Later, we were 
schooled together, were married, 
and asked to be assigned our task • 
together. I did not sentence him, 
and I would have died myself first. 
But he had been here too long. If 
he had gone back, the contagion 
would have gone with- him. It was 
fated. You and I were mere tools. 
Weapons." 

"I'm sorry, Songeen. I do believe 
you loved him." 

She shook her head in curious 
ruffle of emotion. "He was not the 
first. Many of our kind have renounced their birthright to go 
among your people, become like 
you and share your hideous lives. 
They are part of your great religions, part of the legendary history 
of your races.';* 

Silence fell between them. Newlin thought of dying Mars, the 
burnt-out husk of Venus, the political and economic pesthole of Earth 
— even the grim, gray, terrible frontiers on the further planets and 
moons. His recollections were a 
dreadful pageant of spectres, of an 
ugly, terror-haunted childhood, of 



STANLEY MULLEN 

the bleak years of his barren, lonely 
wanderings — the memory kitbag of 
a homeless, and often hunted, 
spacebum. 

"I can believe you," Newlin admitted slowly. "Most of the truly 
worthwhile leaders of mankind 
starid so far above the mob that 
they seem cast in a different mold. 
The real leaders — not politicians, 
nor military brass. The thinkers and 
scientists, even the prophets. Every 
great religion sprang from the vision or inspiration of a single leader. Beyond the chaff, the fragments 
of his actual thoughts and words— 
always sound good. But their followers don't follow them." 

Songeen's face twisted in bitter 
wrath. "How terribly true! Can 
blind men follow the sun? They 
feel its warmth and reach out to it. 
but they stumble and fall on their 
own clay feet. Blind eyes and hands 
can never reach the light. Most of 
our emissaries, of that kind, die horribly, and their message is distorted 
to serve the ends of madness and 
corruption." 

"Is there no hope for us?" 

She stared at him. The pale glow 
of her moonbright eyes softened and 
intensified. 

"One hope, and only in yourselves. We have tried and failed. If 
you feel so strongly, why have you 
done nothing?" 

Bitter hatred snagged in Newlin's throat, making his laugh a 
sound of horror. "Not me. I can 
pity the masses of poor and downtrodden, but only as masses. As abstractions. Individually, I loathe 
them. Cornered rats will fight back 
— but men lick the boots of their 
tormentors. I learned only hate and

83 



defiance. I'm a cornered rat, not a 
man." 

There was sound now, outside 
the door they had entered. Low at 
first, a mere scrabbling, as if the 
trackers had located their refuge. 
In moments only, there came a 
heavy pounding, followed by the 
skirl of atomic drills. Newlin tensed, 
his hand itching at the butt of his 
blaster. 

"I'm a rat," he went on. "Cornered, like any other rat. And the 
terriers are out there scratching at 
my hole. If you'll open that nonsqueak door, I'll talk to them. Maybe even kill a few." 

"No," said Songeen positively. 
"No killing." 

"But I'm a killer," Newlin insisted. "I've killed men before for 
a lot less reason. They're mining the 
door. How long do you think that 
will last against explosives?" 

"Not long," the girl admitted. 
"But long enough. I have the key 
at last. Stand back." 



SOMETHING formless and faintly radiant hovered indescribably 
in space. Suspended above the worn 
flooring, without visible support or 
tangible outline — it existed. Something like weird emptiness, a void 
appearing in the air itself. 

"This is the portal," Songeen told 
him calmly. "Choose now. I will 
take you with me if I can without 
permission. But do not come with 
me, unwarned. There is grave peril, 
beyond anything I can describe to 
you. Beyond your experience or 
imagination. I will try to gej you 
safely back, somehow. But 1 can 
promise nothing. And if you stay 



too long, there is no coming back. 
You must remain there; even if the 
terror of your surroundings kills 
you." 

She stood beside the mysterious 
doorway, waiting. Newlin made a 
start to follow her, then balked. 

"Wait!" he ordered roughly, as 
she was about to lead the way. "I 
Can't go with you — not like this." 

"Afraid?" 

"Yes, but not of you or your 
world. I trust you. But you say everyone here is crazy. That it's infectious. Won't I carry the contagion into your world?" 

Songeen hesitated. Shadows 
deepened inside her eyes. "You ' 
would, yes. But you will have contact with no one but me. Perhaps 
with the Masters — if I can take you 
to them. They may help us, but they 
are strange, unpredictable. Remember, I promise nothing and you 
come at your own risk. But your 
disease will harm no one — I'm inoculated, and the Masters are immune. If you overstay the limit and 
cannot return, you will be decontaminated just as we must be when 
we return to our own people. 

"Here, in this room, is the place 
where the people of our colony on 
Venus were decontaminated before 
they could be allowed to enter the 
place of refuge the Masters had 
prepared for them. It is a cruel and 
harrowing experience. I know. 
There may be a way to get you 
safely back, without that. But your 
mind could never stand the shock. 
Understand that, before you 
choose." 

"If it won't harm you, I'll go 
along," Newlin decided. "Almost 
any world would be an improve

ment on this." 

"Don't be too sure," she warned. 
"At worst, tlje terror here is familiar. Come, then. Hold my hand, 
stay close, and try not to be frightened. It will be bad enough. And 
try not to change too much, or I 
will have difficulty returning you 
alive." 

The portal swallowed her, and 
Newlin felt himself drawn into the 
force-vortex, still clinging to her 
hand. 



TRANSITION was mild enough, 
less shock than he had expected. 

A moment of chill detachment, 
as if something indescribably cold 
shattered his body into component 
atoms and readjusted them to new 
patterns. He gasped, his body making the same thermal changes as ff 
he stood under a cold shower. He 
shivered. 

Then it was like coming out of 
the blanketing fog of horror into 
the sunlight of sanity; like rebirth, 
painlessly, into an eery other-dimension. 

There was light and sound about 
him, a stir of cool air. Songeen had 
become separated from him in that 
moment of strange passage. She 
stood apart, watching him with 
laughter in her eyes. Laughter as 
cool and calm and soothing as the 
soft wind that riffled her hair. She 
had stripped off the bulky armor, 
shed her plastic helmet. Now she 
was all woman again, and somehow, oddly, a symbol of all women. 

Other senses than his five sprang 
into life within him. Weird awareness through new perceptions which 
were ■ nameless to his mind or to 



his memory. 

At first there was no terror, no 
surprise. Merely an overwhelming 
difference. 

Overhead was starless night, but 
not darkness. It was a vaulted, infinite sky, like an inverted ocean of 
tinted crystal, transparent, but softly colored, deepening imperceptibly 
to a heart of emerald, a-glow with 
faintest witchlights. All around him 
was a maze of shimmering crystal 
in odd forms, grotesque, clear but 
echoing the witchlights of that 
haunted sky. 

Wind-borne, came the faint, 
sweet chiming of distinct porcelain 
bells. The place was alive with 
movement, sensed but incompletely 
seen. Even the wind flowed in almost visible currents, thickened as 
if the air had become dense, molten 
glass. All forms in the maze of crystal varied constantly. Light flared 
and died in odd rhythms, and the 
almost visible winds played icy arpeggios upon strings of spun glass, 
like Aeolian harps. Showering notes 
like those of Chinese windbells hung 
in clusters in the eddies of great 
wind rivers, and both sound and 
light flowed together and wove 
strange patterns and infinite variations. 

It was not quite pleasant, vaguely nerve-tightening, but highly 
stimulating. Sound was muted at 
first, as was the light. Images 
blurred and outlines were unsteady, 
baffling. Everything fused and 
flowed together like half molten 
shards of broken glass. Wavelengths of troubled sound formed 
trembling notes that hung in the 
air, almost visible, crystalline and 
somehow painfully dissonant.

Like Songeen, her world or the 
pathway to it was strange, alien, but 
poignantly beautiful. 

It was stranger than he thought. 

He realized almost at once that 
his mind was making adjustments. 
It was lying to him, translating unfamiliar concepts into terms known 
to memory. It was diluting and enfeebling his sensations. But dread 
grew in him. 

When his mind tired, stopped lying to him, what would it really be 
like? Could he stand the factual 
perception? 

They trod the forest aisles of crystalline forms. There was light, of 
odd, gray, glary kind. A twilight, 
silvery, unreal as the trans-Lunar 
dreams of drugged poets. Songeen 
moved ahead slowly, making no effort to regain her clasp of his hand. 
Almost she seemed to avoid him, 
waiting until he almost overtook 
her, then skimming lightly away 
from him. Her slim, pale witchery 
was both taunt and challenge. She 
appeared to float rather than walk. 

One by one she dropped her 
clinging robes. She became part of 
the mad forest, part of its dreamy 
gray enchantments. 

Light grew steadily, and with it 
came more color, more magic, and 
more confusion of senses. The forest-forms assumed strange geometries. They stretched about him in 
endless vistas, blurring and transmuting as he watched. The dreamlike cloudiness was fading from his 
perceptions. He caught dreadful 
hints now and then of new, unheard-of forms and colors, of unstable geometries as far beyond Einstein's as his were beyond Euclid's. 
Nothing was tangible or definite, 



and perhaps that was the secret. 
Nothing ever is. Fear wove a crystalline web about Newlin's throat, 
strangling. 

He halted and took stock. Ahead, 
Songeen waited, watching him, her 
figure a pale, elfin flame form 
against the shadowy mass of colored 
crystals. It was a forest of gemfires, 
and she was the purest jewel of the 
forest. Naked, alien, but — 



WHY HAD he come here? His 
mind balked at backtracking. 
There was no going back. Perhaps 
he had already come too far. Was 
Songeen a vampire luring him into 
the hideous depths of this unknown 
place? He had been here before. It 
was like that awful illusion in the 
tower, but muted. How much did 
he perceive? How much was sheerest self-deception? Was he mad in 
the midst of awful sanity, or sane in 
the ultimate horror of lunacy? 

Her voice floated back to him, its 
sound the chiming crash of splintering glass. 

"Try not to change too much," 
she warned. 

"Change?" Even the word sounded strange to him, as she said it. He 
felt a swift surge of anger. There 
was no change in him — none! 

The tinkling bell-tones matched 
the swirl of his emotion and rose to 
jangling, tormented heights. It was 
shrill, maniacal tumult, that ranged 
upward and upward into octaves 
beyond sound. It was a rollicking, 
tortured insanity. Windbells chiming, jangled; tinkling, shimmering, 
exploding inside his brain. Windbells shattering in a hurricane of 
sound and ecstasy.

With his fists, Newlin pounded at 
his bursting skull. Pain deadened 
perception, gave him a moment's 
relief. 

He was not changing, he shouted 
in loud defense. He was not! 

Songeen poised, watching. Her 
body-outlines swirled and altered 
in swift mutations before his eyes. 
She was not woman now. Not even 
human. She danced and flickered 
and gibbered at him. She was 
jeweled movement. Change. She 
was as crystalline as the forest, as 
molten emerald as the sky. Points of 
fire inside her. caught and flared and 
burned inside his eyes. She was not 
Songeen! 

Newlin screamed. He looked 
down at his hands. He screamed 
again, louder. His hands were transparent as glass, and as fluid as water. Outlines wavered, changed. 

"Try not to change too much," 
Songeen pleaded. But her voice 
joined the clattering crystalline 
tumult^ which raged about him. He 
was cracking. He could feel the 
seams in his mind giving way. 

Like a great, floundering beast, 
he charged toward her. Forms of 
brittle crystal shattered at his 
touch. Shattered into sound and 
pain. The forest-forms changed 
color, echoing his violence. New 
vortices of movement converged 
upon him. Perceptions expanded 
and radiance showered about him, 
through him. 

The hovering, dancing crystal 
notes were now visible. Beads of 
light, dripping from a sky of light. 
They were sound a color, bright, 
bursting bubbles of sound. Their 
rhythmic tempos increased, murmur swelled into insistent roaring 



and the jangling of insane dissonance. Vitreous grotesques shimmered like a forest of aspens quivering in wind and sunlight. Glassy 
fragments of splintered sound 
poured in floods from sky and 
ground. Trampled grass gave way 
under his feet in brittle crunching, 
and the brush shivered at his touch, 
dissolving into chill slivers of slashing sound. 

Blood was dripping. The forest 
changed color, as if crimson stain 
spread through it. Hellish glare was 
a roaring torrent of musical color. 
Red stains spread swiftly, dying the 
crystal columns, the glassy sward, 
seeping into the reeling brain. 

There was blood. The taste of it 
in his mouth, the hot, salt smell, the 
sound of its dripping. He swam in 
seas of ruby light, crashing and 
plunging wildly, sinking into its 
crimson depths. Red light thickened around him, deepened, smothering. 

The darkness was red, fire-shot, 
roaring. . . . 

Then pain and timeless darkness. 

Newlin awakened slowly, to ugly 
tension in his mind. Shadows like 
beating wings disturbed his memory. 

The churning light and sound 
were gone. He drifted idly, body 
and mind coming softly to rest upon 
a bank of soft grass. 

Someone knelt beside him. Someone cried softly, to the same murmurous rhythms of the crystalline 
forest. Without opening his eyes he 
sensed this, and knew also that he 
was still within the eery precincts of 
the maze. He opened his eyes, painfully. 

This time, there were tears, glis

tening and falling slowly, glistening like crystal dewdrops in sunlight, and falling in softly tinkling 
shower like spilled jewels. 

"Songeen!" he cried. 

"Yes," murmured a tympany of 
glass bells, "I am here." 

It was Songeen — almost, again, 
as he remembered her, almost human. It was Songeen, small, delicate, unreal, but sweetly feminine— 
almost human. It was Songeen, but 
with something added, changed, 
oddly blended into both form and 
personality. 

"I tried to save you," she murmured. "I tried, but could not 
reach you. My knowledge is incomplete. I thought you were weak, 
confused, too frightened and disturbed to be changed easily. But 
you were strong, and your violence 
was a challenge to it. Only the Masters could understand. They saved 
you — not I. They intervened in 
time." 

"The Masters!" Newlin glanced 
round, quickly, warily. "They are 
here?" 

"Not here — now. But they saved 
you. I did not know all the dangers. They — not I — " 

"Saved me from wha1> — death?" 

"No — worse. And now they say 
you must go back. At once. The 
Masters urge haste." 



NEWLIN tasted bitterness on his 
lips. "Orders from headquarters. 
Well, I've been kicked out of better 
places — but few more interesting. 
Too bad I forgot my brass 
knuckles." 

Physically, he tried to rise. Every 
bone and muscle ached. But it 



could have been worse. He seemed 
intact. Hints of vagrant color rippled over his visible skin, but he 
sensed neither pain nor menace 
from them. 

Songeen bent over him. Her arm 
supported him in sitting position. It 
was unnecessary, but the sensation 
of contact was pleasant. He yielded 
to her ministrations and looked 
about. It was still the forest, crystalline, murmurous — but now muted. 
The same glary, unpleasant light 
beat down from the same impossible sky. Storming, eery colors 
flowed infinite mutations of form 
through the crystal spectres of the 
maze. And the tinkle of myriad 
glass wind bells held a maddening 
overtone. 

He had thought, somehow, that 
it would be different. That it would 
have changed, subtly, as had Songeen. But from a brief survey, nothing had changed. The tumult had 
faded, become bearable — but identity remained. 

Disappointed, he rose slowly, and 
felt her strong arm clasp about him. 
He felt clumsy, off-balance, but not 
weak. If anything, he was stronger. 
Stronger, and more cleanly, clearly 
alive than he had felt before. 

"Come," urged Songeen. "I will 
take you back to the portal." 

"Back— to that?" 

Newlin struggled with the futility 
of words. He was not sure what he 
wanted, let alone what he wanted 
to say. That insinuating crystalline 
clatter got inside his brain, scattered thought. 

Songeen caught a stirring of rebellion in him and sensed his mental confusion. 

"Don't fear the hunters," she 



88 



STANLEY MULLEN 



said. "There are other doorways, 
and you can issue onto some other 
planet, if you wish. Try not to think, 
or even feel." 

Her voice penetrated the uproar 
of his mind, stilling troubled waters, 
blanketing other sounds. For seconds, it seemed to elevate him to 
some remote, lofty plane where' life 
was serene, uncomplicated. Detached, he drifted with his own 
alien thoughts. Through senses 
other than visual, ke watched his 
stumbling progress at her side as the 
girl threaded a pathway through 
the maze. Through senses not normally his own, he was aware of the 
utter strangeness behind this forest 
and its crystalline mysteries. He 
recognized the girl as part of the 
strangeness. 

Dimly, he sensed some cosmic reluctance in himself, and was disturbed by his trend of thought. 
Faintly, he was aware of bodily 
movement and the crowding feel 
of shadowy aisles about him. But he 
was more aware of the girl, of her 
physical presence, and of the unrest she inspired in him. 

Songeen! He had known many 
women on many, strange worlds. 
But none like this, none ever so 
strange, so wonderful, so terrifying. 
He had wanted her, yes. But only 
for an hour of passion, at first. An 
hour of the blinding futility of trying, in her arms, to forget the 
crowding ugliness of 'life. He had 
not cared if the women he knew 
had souls, or if he had. Souls were 
unfamiliar, vague, and he would 
not have known one if he encountered it. Soft, white bodies, glowing like pale witchlights in the darkness. Yes, he had known many such. 



He had known many women, loved 
none. 

Newlin had not spoken, not in 
words. But Songeen heard, by some 
subtle sense that was part of this abnormal forest. 

Her laugh was a soft tinkle of 
breaking glass. She did not speak 
aloud, but word-symbols of thought 
poured from her mind. Newlin was 
aware of them, springing suddenly 
into his own brain, but he knew 
they came from her. 

"Many women, yes. But none 
like me. If you loved me, it would 
not be for this body. It is not what 
you think. I hold this substance, 
this form, only by power of will. It 
is mine only for a short while more. 
My flesh is not like yours, subject to 
different laws of form and movement." 



NEWLIN answered her, but now 
in words. His voice sounded like 
a note of strained sanity in such a 
place of nightmare. 

"I never learned love in the sense 
you mean," he said. "Nor had I 
thought of you again, in that way — 
after Monta Park. You were too 
alien for me. I understood that. Too 
alien for any kind of love I knew. 
You were — repulsive." 

In silence, then, thoughts blocked 
out, Songeen guided Newlin. She 
seemed aloof, withdrawn. They 
filed slowly amid towering masses 
of smoky crystal. She led, drifting 
like a smoke wraith, before him. 
Newlin picked a cautious pathway 
over treacherous, unstable footing. 
He followed, bemused, and reluctance grew into agony of mind. 

What was wrong with him? Hf

grappled with himself, and strains 
grew into open rebellion. What did 
he want? 

Near the portal, sensing it or another like it, he balked. 

"Songeen!" 

At his call, she glided back, phantomlike. "Yes?" 

"You're in trouble here, aren't 
you? Because of bringing me?" 

Shoulders as translucent as thin 
ivory shrugged. "No matter." 

"But you are?" Newlin insisted, 
as if it mattered suddenly to him. 

"Yes," she granted softly. "But 
do not alarm yourself. Only misunderstanding. I will explain my motives. They will point out my error. 
There is no punishment here." 

"You're not telling everything. 
What is wrong?" 

Her moonfire eyes were troubled. 
"Nothing you can help." 

Newlin probed mercilessly. "Tell 
me. Why did you bring me here? It 
was not only to save me from the 
hunters. Even I guessed that. 
Why?" 

Poised, slender, defiant as a 
sword, Songeen met and parried his 
attack. "I cannot tell you that." 

Newlin took her rebuff gracelessly. He was a son of Chaos, a man of 
the brawling, violent Solar breeds. 
His temper was short, his words and 
actions direct. He saw challenge 
and answered in kind. 

"Then take me to the Masters." 

Fear and fury blazed in her eyes. 
"They have not sent for you. I cannot take you to them like this. You 
are mad. You will live to regret this. 
Why, why?" 

"I'll tell you. You said I could 
be decontaminated. You said I 
could be cured, that I could stay 



here — afterwards. I want to stay 
now. Is there a way. Can I be 
cured?" 

"Of the madness, yes. But it is a 
fearful way. Do you know how all 
lunatics are treated? How they are 
cured, if at all? In your own asylums, do you know how madness is 
treated?" 

"Yes, I know," Newlin answered 
roughly. "By shock treatment. I 
suspected something of the sort, all 
the time. Am I right? Is your treatment similar?" 

Songeen nodded, her movement 
a shimmering echo of the forest's 
mirrored quivering. 

"Similar — but not the same. The 
shock used is different. More intense and terrible than insulin or 
electrical shock. Could you survive 
such treatment?" 

Newlin snorted. "I don't know. 
I'm just crazy enough to try. I 
won't say I like this place — your 
world or the nuthouse entrance to 
it. But with you, I like it better than 
any other place without you. I think 
I'm in love with you." 

Worms of pale light flared and 
writhed in her eyes. Something 
shifted, the oddments of womanflesh shredded from her. Like a 
transparent mannequin of glass, 
she stood. Inside her, luminous organs squirmed visibly. Like a 
dream-woman, she stood just outside the boundaries of sanity. But 
like a dream-woman, she was beautiful, immortal, desirable. 

"You've said it," she murmured. 
"Now that you see mc as I am, do 
you still want me? Say it again, 
now, Spud Newlin, say it in your 
new knowledge of the things as they 
really are."

EWLIN hesitated, made his 

choice. Wandering, ill and alone, 
terrified, in the forests of nightmare — he chose. Madman's choice. 

"I love you, Songeen. Take me 
to the Masters." 

Nightmare wavered. A hand, 
oddly shaped, sought his as the 
witchfires burned low and faded 
from the sky. 

"I can take you now. It is not 
far, and the Masters are waiting. I 
have warned you. If, after that 
warning, you still ask to stay, they 
will grant your wish. It needed only 
your free choice. I am glad you 
have chosen, but shock treatment is 
a dangerous chance. Are you sure 
you love me— enough?" 

"Songeen!" his mind pleaded. 
"Wait!" 

She heard his wordless cry, and 
waited, opening the glowing, pure 
citadel of her thoughts to him. She 
gave no answer in words or glowing thought symbols. She waited. 

"No, I haven't changed my mind. 
I want to stay. Maybe I can learn 
to like your world. I want the decontamination — the shock treatment. I'm scared, but I want it, no 
matter how it hurts. I want to" stay 
here — but not if you're not here. I 
want to be with you — Hell, Venus^ 
or even Callisto — I want to go with 
you. I love you. If my love is part 
of my madness, don't cure me. I 
haven't asked you, but I'd like to 
know. Do you love me?" 

Songeen was silent. In the glittering forest of crystalline tree 
forms, jeweled birds sang wild riots 
of bubbling, bursting notes. Darkness gathered swiftly in the dense 
air. 

"Didn't you know?" Songeen 



STANLEY MULLEN 

chimed, matching the bird-notes. 
Our names are already enrolled in 
the Great Book. It was custom here, 
our mating rite. It was the only way 
I could bring you. I did not tell you, 
because — " 

She stopped, then continued. 
"Because I had to be sure of you. 
Because I wanted you to have free 
choice. Now you must share all my 
tasks, my responsibilities. Before, 
the task was mine alone. Now we 
must share it. You and I are selected—" 
"Selected for what?" Newlin 
broke in. 

He could not see her for thick 
darkness. But he sensed eery tension of movement, and emotion 
flowed to him from her mind. 

"For the great task, the last and 
greatest of all. We must go back together. To Hell. To the system you 
sprang from. It is for us -to release 
to them the ultimate weapon. The 
deadline is close, as I told you. 
Other races grow desperate, now 
that your system's isolation is breaking down. Pressure for interstellar 
expansion is extreme on all of Sol's 
planets. The technicians work full 
time at the problems, and they will 
solve it, soon. We have until then, 
to kill or cure the patient. 

"Other powers and weapons have 
been released to them in the hope 
that mounting responsibility would 
bring sanity. Atomic power was 
turned into dangerous toys, implements of murder. We gave them 
knowledge of atomic fission and 
fusion, and they use the knowledge 
to butcher and destroy each other. 
We tried all the minor shock treatments. They have failed. The time 
has come for the final treatment. 



SHOCK TREATMENT 



91 



The major shock. We — you and I — 
must give them the ultimate weap


on.' 



NEWLIN knew his humanity. He 
protested. "But why? If they 
have misused everything else. Why 
give them something still more 
hideous? Why give them means for 
further destruction?" 

Her answer pulsed through darkness which glittered like black crystal. 

"Because it is the final experiment. The last hope for your people, your system. We cannot help 
them beyond that. They must 
choose for themselves, as you did. 
We must go back to Earth, this 
time. And it is our task to give them 
the final treatment and test. The ultimate weapon. Gravity displacement. Once used, it is the end. 
Planets will be wrenched from the 



Sun, electrons from their parent 
nuclei within the very atoms. It is 
the same force. The choice is theirs 
— kill or cure. Sanity or destruction. You and I will stay, try to 
guide and help, advise, but not interfere. Like you, your people must 
have free choice. 

"We must stay with them, and 
share whatever happens. This is 
their shock treatment — and yours. 
We will share it together. But come, 
the Masters are waiting. I will take 
you to them." 

"Together!" said Newlin, awed. 
"You will stay with me and share 
my — our shock treatment!" 

"Together, always — now. It is a 
small price to pay, whatever happens," murmured Songeen. 

Her hand drew him close, and 
she led him outside the zone of crystalline murmurs. Darkness leaned 
closer, solid, tangible. Ahead, was 
a great and terrible light. 



THE END 



SCIENCE BRIEFS 



By Charles Recour 



Substitute For Thought! 

POETS and philosophers agree: 
the hardest thing the human 
being is called upon to do is — to 
think! No task is more arduous or 
more difficult, and to confirm this 
supposition all you have to do is 
reflect on any difficult problems 
which have ever engaged your 
mind. Thinking is no joke! 

It is generally cbnceded that the 
most abstract realm of thinking is 
mathematical. In some respects 
that is true and in others it is the 
exact opposite of the facts. Actually mathematics is "simplified" 
thinking, a sort of thinking with 
nine-tenths of the work taken out. 
The reason for that rather surprising statement is the fact that much 
of what we call mathematics is actually "symbol manipulation" — 
which is a sort of machine into 
which you put ideas, turn the crank 
and grind out answers. 

Great mathematicians have frequently reiterated the truism "a 
good symbology is half the battle." 
What they are referring to is that 
mathematical ideas, while very 
hard to, discover and understand, 
..become ridiculously easy in many 
cases, when they are framed in a 
set of symbols which can be easily 
manipulated according to standardized rules. That in effect for ex


ample, is what algebra is. Algebra 
is a machine for handling mathematical relationships. So is trigonometry, calculus and many other 
branches of mathematical thinking. 
The difficulty lies in first, mastering the symbology, then the understanding of what's being done. 
After that you just supply the problem, turn the symbolic crank and 
out pop the answers, neat and automatically. 



IF YOU doubt that that is the 
case, take a very simple arithmetic or algebra problem, rephrase 
it in words and then try to solve it 
in words. It's tough, mighty tough! 
That's what the earliest of Babylonian and Assyrian thinkers did. 
It's a tribute to them that they got 
anywhere at all, and as positive evidence of the importance of symbols, 
it may be recalled that mathematics 
didn't begin its enormous expansion until the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries by which time, 
the symbols had been worked out 
and the science had been reduced 
to a game of "chess on paper." This 
is an over simplification of course, 
a half truth, since the thinking still 
must be done. But symbols cut the 
work into a tiny fraction of what 
it was. 

Today symbology is all impor


92 



SCIENCE BRIEFS 

tant and tomorrow, symbolic logic 
will be one of the guiding spirits 
of scientific advances as it is suggesting itself today. When the first 
savage recognized that two men 
and two rocks have in common 
their "twoness" he made an enormous step; equally important and 
much richer in results are the superb ideas of calling things and 
ideas by synibols, letters, marks — 
what have you. Don't sell "X marks 
the spot" short! 



Well-Digger Giganticus 

WHOEVER has glanced at 
any of the earth-moving machinery in common use today, has 
automatically marveled at the size 
and impressiveness of these robotic 
mechanisms whose scale is that of 
the prehistoric monsters. It is one 
thing to speak of telephone switchboards and electronic calculating 
machines as robots ; it is another to 
observe the gigantic robots some 
machines have become. Latest in 
this chain of automaticity is the mobile oil-well driller! 

Thousands of wells per year are 
drilled in the United States in a 
tremendous effort to keep the hungry maw of oil-consumers satisfied, 
especially since resources appear to 
be dwindling at a rapid rate. The 
setting up of an oil drilling system 
has been a major operation/ Much 
equipment, massive and bulky and 
powered by large amounts of energy, is needed. Then, because nine 
out of ten wells prove dry, the 
equipment must be torn up and 
moved elsewhere. 

Enterprising entrepreneurs — 



93 

tough-bitten pioneers who would 
flinch at the word "entrepreneur" 
— have devised a truck-borne setup which, powered and completely 
self-contained with two 1200 horsepower diesel engines, practically 
drills a deep- well by itself! The 
equipment is so flexible and so ingeniously contrived, that it operates 
from a console-panel arrangement 
much like a control tower or an 
organ. The well is drilled; should 
it be dry — as it most often is — the 
drillers tear up stakes with no trouble at all, move on, and start elsewhere. The thing is done so rapidly 
and so smoothly that it has a truly 
robot-like effect on a hypnotized 
observer. 

What is more important is that 
this effort points another signpost towards the future. The coal 
mines have seen the introduction 
of automatic machinery, the factories have become more mechanized, the farms too are machinery 
plus — all these things confirm positively the outline of the future ; machines, machines and more machines, in every degree of complexity, with every conceivable type of 
modern scientific development, all 
operated by an engineer-technician. 
The pattern is outlined heavily; 
the future belongs to the technician ! 



Optical Sandblasting! 

OPTICS is probably one of the 
most precise of all the applied 
sciences and the technicians in the 
field are accustomed to working in 
millionths of an inch. It is hard to 
reconcile this fact with the recent 



94 



CHARLES RECOUR 



technique devised by Dr. William 
A. Rhodes, who makes telescope 
mirrors by sandblasting! 

Amateur telescope-making has 
been discussed before in these pages 
sinee many a science fiction reader 
is also an amateur astronomer. 
Consequently the technique ordinarily used in making precise re-, 
fleeting telescope mirrors is familiar 
to many. The practice of simply 
rubbing two circular discs together 
with an abrasive between, producing a resultant mirror as the abrasives selected become finer and 
finer, results in a parabolic mirror 
with an accuracy of a fractional 
millionth of an inch. This is old hat 
and has been done ever since the 
Newtonian telescope. 

Dr. Rhodes, however, wishing to 
minimize the tedious work of 
rough-grinding telescope mirrors, 
decided to blast out the basic curve 
with a sandblaster, and then finish 
off the mirror with conventional 
grinding practices. The sixteen inch 
mirror, with an f/3.3 curve was 
roughed out with a cemetery monument sandblaster. And that's all 
there was to it. After finish grinding the mirror was perfect. 

That suggests a whole new technique in optical work which has 
always deplored, the necessary tedium of slow grinding of resistant 
glass which seems after a time to 
develop an obstinacy 'and an obtuseness all its own. 

Today's age is characterized by 
instruments, electronic, optical and 
mechanical. Tomorrow will even be 
more of an instrument decade-^-or 
century — any techniques designed 
to make instrument-making simpler 



and just as accurate are more than 
eventful — they are news! 



Cat's Foot Seismograph! 

THE two-hundred inch reflecting telescope is the gadget at 
Mount Palomar that ordinarily 
makes the news. But Palomar is 
more than an astronomical observatory with the world's biggest 
telescope. It is also a seismological 
station, shortly to be second to none 
in the world. In particular it is 
making use of the new electromagnetic seismograph, a machine so 
sensitive it can record the footsteps 
of a cat through hundreds of feet 
of solid rock! 

An ordinary seismograph is essentially nothing more than a large 
mass suspended from a wire. Delicate pick-up instruments connected 
to it, record its inertia while the 
earth about it shakes. Hence, the 
seismographic mass remains "at 
rest" while the earth quakes. As is 
well known seismographs pick up 
earth tremors from distances equal 
to the diameter of the Earth, so 
sensitive are they. 

But the electromagnetic instrument puts even these to shame. It 
is a long quartz tube, about two 
and one half inches in diameter 
and one hundred and twenty feet 
long. It is anchored at each end to 
a pier set deep into the earth, while 
flexible supports along its length 
take up its weight. This "strain 
seismograph" like any strained 
quartz crystal then delivers an electrical impulse no matter how 
slightly it is disturbed. This, amplified and recorded automatically,

provides a sonic and visual picture 
of earth tremors anywhere. Its sensitivity is so great it must be installed miles from human disturbances. 

One of the neat aspects of the 
recording mechanism is that it 
catches at a definite rate; then during play-back it speeds up this rate 
so that a long drawn out quake may 
be recorded as a pistol shot or a 
slightly longer rumble! Seismography is extremely important (witness its detection of the Soviet 
atomic bomb explosions!) and 
Mount Palomar is due to become 
the center of its research here. 



Metals Made To Order! 

METALLURGICAL research 
is opening up an entirely 
new field, a field in which specific 
metals are tailored exactly to suit 
a given purpose, much in the manner in which ordinary, alloys have 
been prepared, but differing in that 
the rarest, oddest metals are now 
used, with the most unusual techniques. 

Zirconium, hafnium, molybdenum, rhenium, columbium, cerium, 
thallium — the list reads like a recitation of the Periodic Table, are 
being put to work in applications 
not even thought of so short a time 
as five years ago. 

Rhenium for example is a metal 
whose commercial importance cannot be underestimated. It is the 
densest metal known, it has a melting point as high as tungsten, its 
electron emission rate is better 
than that of tungsten and its lifs is 
greater than that metal when used 



in vacuum tube applications. The 
only drawback to wide use of this 
exotic metal is that it now costs 
$900 a pound! 

Most of these metals require refining and extraction methods far 
different from the relatively simple 
methods of the blast furnace or the 
electrolytic refining tank. They 
often must be prepared in a high 
vacuum chamber at temperatures 
extremely high. In addition they 
are usually associated with large 
quantities of "dead" ore or a sort of 
gangue which must be discarded 
slag-like. In a word, the recovery 
of these metals is difficult. 

Applied technology is jumping 
forward however at such a fabulous 
rate that no metal can be ignored, 
and every possible metal must be 
examined carefully for potential 
uses. It has gotten so that, if you 
desire a metal with certain properties, you simply specify them to the 
metallurgist and he goes into 
the pilot-plant-laboratary, operates 
equipment unthought of two years 
ago, and comes out with your sample — done! Metallurgy has some 
amazing surprises coming up in the 
near future — tailor-made metals 
are only a beginning! 



Rockets Made Of Light! 

LIGHT is generally regarded as 
the most ethereal of material 
substances. You don't think of mass 
or weight associated with dancing 
beams of sunlight or the flickering 
glitter of the stars! Never the less, 
light has mass, measurable and 
computable, and it can move 
"mountains." A glance at the fa


96 



CHARLES RECOUR 



miliar "E equals mc squared" of 
Einstein shows that if you work the 
other way around, measure the 
energy of a beam of light, it is possible to figure out the mass associated with that light. 

Even more directly it is possible 
to measure the force exerted on an 
object by the pressure of a beam of 
light streaming against it. This implies momentum and where you 
have momentum, you have mass. 

, Thoughts like these have been occuring with increasing frequency 
among men who have to do with 
rocketry and the ultimate hope, of 
putting men into space. Recently it 
was suggested by an authority on 
rocketry that space ships be propelled by "sails" — gigantic thm.faced mirrors capable of catching 
sunlight and using its pressure as a 
propellent medium! As fantastic as 
that suggestion sounds it is perfectly conceivable in the vacuum of 
space where the slightest amount of 
thrust would have effect. 

Perhaps even more suggestive of 
the ultimate importance of using a 
light beam as a propellant, is the 
suggestion that eventually a motor 
of sorts will be designed, capable 
of emitting light in such quantities 
as to be enough to offer substantial 



thrust to its attached rocket- — sort 
of like a flashlight turned around. 



WHEN the actual thrust of ordinary sunlight against the 
Earth's surface is computed, it 
turns out that the figure measured 
in dynes or Newtons of thrust is 
quite surprisingly large. Now while 
the Earth is huge, and any rocket 
would be comparatively minute, the 
principles are still the same. Light 
has mass; mass ejected at the speed 
of light exerts powerful measurable 
thrust — enough to move things! 

Scientists who have taken the 
measure of thisjheory of light-propelling naturally don't expect to see 
this as one of the early means of 
securing interplanetary flight. But 
many think that ultimately it may 
prove to be the way Man will reach 
the stars! That goal, remote as it 
may seem now to people who know 
we haven't even gotten into space 
yet, is still in the consciousness of 
rocketmen. Someday, interstellar 
flights are going to be made, and if 
the physics of the future hasn't 
given us some sort of "space-warp" 
drive, the insignificant motes of 
force exerted by beams of light may 
do the trick! 



THE END 



GUEST EDITORIAL 

By Xila Shaffer 

Editor Fantastic Adventures 



INEXORABLY, we seem to be 
drifting toward mass suicide in 
an ever-increasing momentum. As 
we contemplate the vicious and 
deadly weapons which man, in his 
fears continues to produce, we have 
the impulse to call out: "Hold on 
there. You're not accomplishing a 
thing, you're only destroying yourself." But no one is listening. Everybody is too intent on building his 
own protective arsenal, to stop to 
think how much better if we didn't 
need one in the first place. 

Let's think about it. What are 
we? And what are we trying to do? 
There's this great big beautiful 
planet, rich in everything we could 
possibly want — or ever absorb. 
Enough of everything for everybody. And then there are people— 
homo sapiens — you and me. 

God — or anything you want to 
call Him — created Heaven and 
Hell, and the Earth between. And 
on Earth he put Man, the highest 
thinking of all animals. With life, 
He gave man a free will, which 
probably includes the ability to commit suicide. But man suffers from 
delusions of grandeur. He's too 
highly impressed with an importance that isn't there. He's not irre


placeable, nor is he as tough or as 
smart as he thinks he is. Sure, he 
can blow himself to Kingdom 
Come. But 10,000 years from now 
trees and grasses will still cover the 
land and the seasons will go on. 

All man will ever succeed in killing is himself. 

It would stand to reason that 
God has plans for this planet of 
ours. With or without us. If man 
chooses to drop out, he will hardly 
be missed. 

Throughout our entire history, 
we have been busy inventing weapons that would either put an end 
to warfare — or depopulate the 
world. Probably gun powder was 
the most terrifying invention of all. 
It created stupendous vistas of 
destruction — but the world survived. Hundreds of thousands of 
people may have been killed, but 
the world survived, with enough of 
man remaining to continue running 
the show. 

When Robert Fulton launched 
the first steamboat on the Seine 
River that day in 1803, he was — 
without being aware of it — introducing a new era: the invincible 
navy. But the best this development 
did was to make the British fleet in


97 



98 



LILA SHAFFER 



vincible for 100 years or so. And 
then other, and stronger, weapons 
came along. 



WORLD WAR I ushAed in a 
triple dose of horror: the 
airplane, the tank, and poison gas. 
The awful aftermath of the gas was 
the nearest thing to bringing man 
to mutual agreement: it was the 
first weapon which man felt had to 
be eliminated. 

But then Einstein's theories, and 
all the neutrons and protons and 
electrons — and it was August 1945 
and an atomic bomb was dropped 
on two cities, with devastating results. But the world went on. And 
will continue to go on. 

Let's face it. No bomb has ever 
been invented — and there's no possibility of one ever coming up— 
which will knock the seams of this 
planet apart. No weapon of destruction will ever be devised which can 
do the damage that one small 
tremor of nature can accomplish: 
like the San Francisco earthquake, 
the destruction of Pompeii, the 
cataclysm that removed Atlantis. 



TRULY, only a creature as con-" 
ceited as Man could indulge 
in the fears that are currently 
sweeping the earth. Only a creature 
steeped in his own egotism could 
seriously contemplate the possibility 



of destroying, with his feeble brain 
and hands, the work of a Creator, 
the power and scope of which can 
be only dimly conceived. We feel 
that we have gone far in our climb 
toward the stars and, in some ways, 
we have. But little is ever said concerning the departments in which 
we have progressed not at all. 

And the backwardness far outweighs the progress. We look up 
into the depths of the heavens with 
scarcely more understanding of 
what it entails then had our clubbearing ancestors. Our minds are 
too puny to conceive either the 
structure of a space that never ends 
or — in relation to the complete concept — a space that has fixed 
boundaries somewhere beyond our 
reach. We have found, through 
stubborn searching, seemingly miracle-working drugs. But we know 
little of why they work. One could 
go on for hours, sounding the true 
depths of human ignorance. 

In fact, it somehow smacks of 
sacrilege, to conceive a God that 
would allow a handful of microorganisms such as we, to endanger, 
by our stupidity, any of His majestic works. 

So the sooner we get wise to ourselves, the better. The world will 
go on — and if we don't play the 
leading role on its stage, there will 
be other actors in our place; others 
more deserving, perhaps, of the gift 
of life. 



Utopia had been reached. All the problems of 
mankind had been solved. It was the perfect 
State. If you doubted it, you died. 



The -de 

Wholesome Land 



WHILE Professor Gargill lectured from the rostrum, 
Ned 1 ! Pardeau prowled the dark auditorium. This, he knew, was the 
place to find them. Here was where 
they whispered and plotted and 
schemed — feeling safe in this pure, 
hard core of patriotism. 

Safe because Cargill was the Director of Education in the New 
State, just as Pardeau was the Director of Public Security. Safe because CargilPs lectures were given 
before a commanded audience, 
with attendance strictly mandatory. 

The insistance was not really 
necessary of course. The people 
would have come to hear Cargill 
regardless. His was a compelling, 
magnetic personality. Even now his 
great voice was booming out: 

" — and upon this anniversary of 
the New State, we can look out with 



great pride upon a clean and wholesome land. With strong emotion, 
we can look upon the physical 
manifestation of our glorious principles — that only through self-effacement — through fanatic love for 
the state — can the individual come 
to complete physical and mental 
fruition. Upon this anniversary 
we see our enemies, both within and 
without, broken, and completely 
subjugated — " 

This was the place they whispered and schemed and plotted. 
Pardeau prowled the aisles, his 
eyes piercing the darkness — spotting them, cataloguing them. And 
thus he came upon Emil Hillerman, 
his Deputy of Vital Intelligence sitting dutifully in the end seat of a 
middle aisle. Hillerman's thick lips 
hung lax, his eyes squinted laboriously as he sought to follow the 



99 



TOO 



RALPH SHOLTO 



thread of Cargill's lecture. 

Pardeau tapped Hillerrnan on the 
shoulder. The latter started guiltily. 
He whirled and sought to identify 
Pardeau in the semi-darkness. Pardeau said, "Please step outside with 
me. I have some questions." 

There was fear in Hillerman's 
bearing as he got clumsily to his 
feet and followed Pardeau. But 
none of Cargill's speech was missed. 
A battery of loud speakers carried 
it even into the foyer where Pardeau 
stopped and turned on Hillerrnan. 
He regarded the man through cold, 
calculating eyes. He seemed to be 
both enjoying Hillerman's discomfort and also listening to Cargill's 
booming words. 

" — these pale weaklirjgs, these 
traitors with twitching muscles and 
twitching minds who skulked in 
dark places have been finally and 
decisively defeated. Even their 
vaunted leader — " 

"What have you been doing," 
Pardeau asked, "relative to Karl 
Lenster?" \ 

The frightened Hillerrnan licked 
his fat lower lip as he sought 
for words. "Everything — everything 
possible. But Lenster is clever. You 
know that. You know that yourself." 

Pardeau's eyes bored into those 
of the Intelligence Director. They 
were noted for their icy penetration, but upon this night they were 
like steel knives. It was as though 
he surveyed Hillerrnan from behind the bulwark of some new and 
hostile information. Even as he 
stared, Cargill was booming from 
the rostrum: 

" — Karl Lenster, their peerless 
leader — " 



And Cargill's voice crackled with 
the inflections of pure contempt. 

" — a degenerate — a dope addict 
who's greatness lay only in the 
realms of his sensual dreams. A 
weak, pitiful figure bereft of followers, cringing alone in — " 

When Pardeau spoke, his voice 
held a new sharpness to complement the new ice in his eyes. He 
said, "In half an hour I am attending a meeting of the Council. They 
will want a report. What about 
Lenster?" 

Hillerrnan looked quickly to right 
and left, then back at his Chief. He 
hesitated as though fearing the consequences of what he was about to 
reveal. "You know of the Wyckoff 
Chemical Transformation Process — " 

"Certainly I know of it," Pardeau blazed. "What about it?" 

"I — I — " But Hillerrnan seemed 
to lose the courage he'd screwed 
up to continue in this direction., He 
straightened and a little of the 
hangdog servility dropped away. "I 
am doing all that is humanly possible to apprehend Lenster. All that 
any man could do. The secret jails 
are full. My interrogators work 
night and day. Even a superficial 
check of my records would show 
that more has been done in the last 
six months and is being done now 
than—" 

Pardeau raised an impatient 
hand, opening a gap of silence into 
which the voice of Cargill poured. 

" — land in which the voice of 
dissenter is not heard; in which 
Lenster and men of. his despicable 
ilk are forever crushed and beaten—" 

Pardeau was scowling. Almost 



THE CLEAN AND WHOLESOME LAND 



101 



unconsciously he had held the 
pause, with hand upraised, until 
Cargill finished his passage. As Cargill stopped for breath, Pardeau 
jerked his hand down sharply, completing the gesture. "I have no time 
for any more of this. And I resent 
having to seek yoii out. Next time 
report to my office as is proper and 
keep me posted as to your activities. 
Next—" 

Pardeau eyed Hillerman for one 
blank moment and allowed . the 
threat to reflect clearly that possibly there would not be many more 
next times. Then he turned and 
strode swiftly from the foyer. 



CARGILL'S voice had hardly 
faded when he picked it up 
again on his car radio. It was a 
foregone conclusion that every 
radio in the land would be tuned 
to the lecture. So great was Cargill's popularity that every citizen 
traveling in a car would wish to 
hear it and turn on his receiver. It 
was foolish not to have a radio 
properly tuned when Cargill spoke. 
He was saying: 

" — and so under the banner of 
complete solidarity, we will march 
forward, a solid phalanx against 
which no force can stand. Now that 
our own house is swept clean of vermin — rid forever of carrion like 
Lenster and his ilk, we can — " 

Pardeau had traveled swiftly 
through the streets at the high speed 
reserved for higher servants of the 
New State. Lesser servants of the 
New State had learned caution and 
thus no regrettable deaths or maimings occurred; the lesser servants 



having grown wary and fleet of 
foot. 

Pardeau switched off his motor 
but left his radio blaring. Cargill's 
voice followed him up the broad 
steps of the Executive Building and 
was just fading out when Pardeau 
was able to pick it up again from 
the loudspeaker under the great 
arches. 

He entered the building and 
traversed the vast foyer to a niche 
which housed a private elevator. He 
entered the lift, deserting it on the 
ninth floor, where he entered an 
unobtrusive door and joined a 
group which consisted of the New 
State's well guarded pool of power 
and brains. 

There was Blanchard of Finance 
— Keeley, Director of Foreign Education. Masichek overlord of the 
nation's larder, and seven others. 

When Pardeau entered, all conversation stopped and every , man 
looked up from a luxurious overstuffed chair. Pardeau must certainly have swelled inwardly with 
pride at this unconscious tribute. 
It was well known that he held a 
key position on the chessboard of 
politics. His was in reality the most 
important job of all. It was to Pardeau that this powerful group of 
men looked for that which they 
most treasured — their own personal 
safety. 

A chair was waiting for Pardeau. 
He said, "I'm sorry to be late, gentlemen. I have been on a personal 
tour of inspection. I'm sure you will 
forgive me however. I have a most 
interesting report." 

He seated himself, timing the action so it coincided with the ebb of 
applause coming over the speaker 



102 



RALPH SHOLTO 



— applause from the loyal multitudes who had just heard Professor . 
Cargill end his lecture. As it 
was now permissible, Blanchard 
reached under the' table and 
snapped a button. The speaker went 
silent. 

"An interesting report?" Keeley 
asked. 

"Amazingly so," Pardeau said. "I 
have just unearthed a traitor — a 
traitor in a high place." 

Every man in the group strove 
not to react and this striving was in 
itself a reaction. "Most interesting," 
Blanchard murmured. "Are you 
ready to name names?" 

"That is my intention, but in 
order to forestall a great many questions, let me give you a complete 
background." 

Leiderman, Ambassador without 
Portfolio, and very close to the 
Man of Almost Sacred Name who 
never attended these meetings, felt 
strong enough to evince impatience. 
"The name, man! First the name. 
Then- the details." 

Pardeau smiled coldly. "Very 
well. The name is, Karl Lenster." 

Leiderman sprang from his chair, 
his face bordering on purple. "Is 
this a joke, Pardeau? We all know 
Lenster is the arch-traitor of our 
times — the leader of the resistance 
movement. Talk sense!" 

Pardeau, not in the least disconcerted, smiled coldly. "I'm sorry. 
Perhaps I should haVe said Emil 
Hillerman, my Deputy of Vital Intelligence, the man who holds immeasurable power in his two 
hands." 

Blanchard was not given to outbursts. But his lips were grim as he 
said, "We are waiting for you to 



talk sense, Pardeau." 

"The confusion comes from your 
not allowing me to tell it as I 
wished. There is a gap between 
Lenster and Hillerman'; one which 
— with your permission — I will fill." 

"Talk, man! Talk!" 

"You have all heard of Formula 
652, known also as the Wyckoff 
Chemical Transformation Process." 

There were expressions of both 
understanding and bewilderment. 
Noting these, Pardeau said, "For 
those of you who haven't made a 
point of looking into the thing, I'll 
explain. Wyckoff, in case you don't 
recall, was a chemical engineer of 
more than average ability who 
stumbled onto this formula before 
he died, most regretfully, four years 
ago, in 1984." 

Leiderman continued to scowl. 
"Wc all know each other, Pardeau. 
Call a spade a spade. Wyckoff was 
a reactionary scoundrel whom you 
did away with for reasons of secur
ity-" 

"Precisely," Pardeau said. "In its 
essence, the formula is a process for 
taking over a man's brain — his body 
— his personality." 

"You mean — " 

Pardeau refused to be interrupted. "We were of the opinion 
that Wyckoff, though he and Lenster were great friends, was not able 
to impart his knowledge to the latter. We took him into custody 
shortly after he perfected the formula and were fortunate in persuading him to give it to us." 

"But he gave it to Lenster also?" 

"We were certain, at the time of 
his death that he had not been able 
to do that — we are still certain." 

Keeley, with a gesture, requested 



THE CLEAN AND WHOLESOME LAND 



103 



the floor. "I wonder if you could go 
into a little more detail concerning 
the formula — for those of us 
who—" 

"Of course," Pardeau said. "The 
formula is a combination of six 
chemicals and the process of transformation is relatively simple, yet 
highly dangerous to both subjects 
involved. It means sure death for 
the proposed host, and if not delicately handled will also result in 
death for the usurper. The transformation requires three hours to 
perform. Once completed successfully, the usurper can never return 
to his own body. It must be 
destroyed. Also, the mentality of the 
host vanishes after it is pushed from 
its original brain tissue through the 
influence of the formula." 

"Then if Wyckoff didn't give the 
formula to Lenster, it was stolen 
from our vaults — or wherever 
it was kept?" 

"Exactly. Certain investigations 
I have made prove beyond doubt 
that Lenster got to my Deputy, 
Hillerman. I never considered Hillerman very bright, but I thought 
him to be honest and loyal. But beyond all doubt, with his aid, Lenster 
stole the. formula — possibly got it 
verbally — and used it to take Hillerman's body from him." Pardeau 
smiled grimly. "Therefore, gentlemen, we have a traitor in a high 
place. My Deputy of Vital Intelligence." 



PARDEAU sat silent now, seeming to enjoy the fear he had engendered in his colleagues — sat silent until Leiderman said, "You've 
arrested him of course." 



"No. I have not." 

"Then get at it, man — get at it." 

"I have no intention of arresting 
Hillerman." 

Leiderman's eyes widened as did 
those of the rest of the company. 
But Blanchard, even under the 
impact of such a bombshell had 
the presence of mind to glance at 
his watch. Immediately he snapped 
on the loudspeaker. The voice of 
Professor Cargill blared forth: 

" — and upon this anniversary of 
the New State, we can look with 
pride upon a clean and wholesome 
land—" 

It was the rebroadcast, from recordings, of Cargill's speech and no 
man in his right mind would have 
refrained from tuning it in because 
everyone wanted to hear it at least 
twice. 

Leiderman, almost apoplectic, 
ignored the speech. "Not arresting 
him! Are you mad?" 

"I'm quite sane, and the situation 
is well in hand." Pardeau grinned 
and there was wickedness in the 
grin — wickedness and intelligence. 
"As I said before, Hillerman was 
not a smart man. His job was too 
much for him and I would have 
been faced, soon with the necessity 
of replacing him regardless. Lenster, on the other hand, is of gradeA intellect. But, gentlemen, he is 
frightened — badly frightened in his 
new environment — and in order to 
insure his own safety, is doing an 
excellent job. Ever since the transformation, that department has 
gained in efficiency until it now 
ranks as one of the highest in our 
entire government." 

Slowly, Pardeau's strategy 
dawned on the group. Blanchard 



104 



RALPH SHOLTO 



suddenly smiled. Then Pardeau 
scowled and went on with a new 
and sudden ferocity. "I have the 
proof, and I have Lenster-Hillerman under my palm. So he stays — ■ 
continues to do a good job for us. 
But he'll be watched, gentlemen. 
He won't be able to go to the bathroom without being under surveillance. We will learn a great deal 
from him. All we need to know." 

"Then you'll arrest him?" the 
boss of the state larder> wanted to 
know. 

Pardeau came to his feet. His fist 
slammed down on the table. "I 
shall not arrest him — ever. When 
the time comes, I shall personally 
shoot him down in the street like a 
dog. There will come a day, gentlemen, when you will witness this 
act of vengeance — when I shall 
make such an example of LensterHillerman as the resistance will not 
forget — a morale-crumbling example, I promise you." 

" — in which Lenster and his ilk 
afe forever crushed and beaten," 
the speaker said. 

Blanchard took the floor. "Gen


tlemen — I move a vote of thanks 
and confidence for our colleague, 
Neal Pardeau." 

The Director of Public Security 
stood at attention and assayed a 
sharp, military bow. It was a moment of rare triumph. "Thank you, 
gentlemen," he said. 



An hour later, Lenster-Pardeau 
was alone in his apartments. He 
stripped off his uniform with an 
air of grim satisfaction. While he 
undressed, he thought of the martyrs to the Cause ; the men who had 
died. He thought of Wyckoff and 
wished Wyckoff could have had 
the pleasure of knowing who had 
usurped the body of Neal Pardeau 
• — Pardeau the Butcher — the infamous Pardeau. 

From the speaker came the third 
and final rebroadcast of CargilFs 
speech : 

" — a clean and wholesome 
land^" 

"A clean and wholesome land," 
Lenster murmured, and the tone 
of his voice was a prayer.

The Last Supper 



By T. D. Hamm 



HAMPERED as she was by the 
child in her arms, the woman 
was running less fleetly now. A wave 
of exultation swept over Guldran, 
drowning out the uneasy feeling of 
guilt at disobeying orders. 

The instructions were mandatory 
and concise: "No capture must be 
attempted individually. In the 
event of sighting any form of human life, the ship MUST be notified immediately. All small craft 
must be back at the landing space 
not later than one hour before takeoff. Anyone not so reporting will be 
presumed lost." 

Guldran thought uneasily of the 
great seas of snow and ice sweeping inexorably toward each other 
since the Earth had reversed on its 
axis in the great catastrophe a millenium ago. Now, summer and winter alike brought paralyzing .gales 
and blizzards, heralded by the sleety 
snow in which the woman's skinclad feet had left the tracks which 
led to discovery.

His trained anthropologist's mind 
speculated avidly over the little they 
had gotten from the younger of the 
two men found nearly a week before, nearly frozen and half -starved. 
The older man had succumbed almost at once; the other, in the most 
primitive sign language, had indicated that, of several humans living 
in caves to the west, only he and 
the other had survived to flee some 
mysterious terror. Guldran felt a 
throb of pity for the woman and her 
child, left behind by the men, no 
doubt, as a hindrance. 

But what a stroke of fortune that 
there should be left a male and female of the race to carry the seed 
of Terra to another planet. And 
what a triumph if he, Guldran, 
should be the one to return at the 
eleventh hour with the prize. No 
need of calling for help. This was 
no armed war-party, but the most 
defenseless being in the Universe — 
a mother burdened with a child. 

Guldran put on another burst of 

05

speed. His previous shouts had 
served only to ,spur the woman to 
greater efforts. Surely there was 
some magic word that had survived 
even the centuries of illiteracy. 
Something equivalent to the "bread 
and salt" of all illiterate peoples. 
Cupping his hands to his mouth, 
he shouted, "Food! food!" 

Ahead of him the woman turned 
her head, leaped lightly in midstride, and went on ; slowing a little 
but still running doggedly. 

Guldran's pulse leaped. He yelled 



again, "Food!" 

The instant that his foot touched 
the yielding surface of the tr£tp, he 
knew that he had met defeat. As his 
body crashed down on the firesharpened stakes, he knew too the 
terror from which the last men of 
the human race had fled. 

Above him the woman looked 
down, her teeth gleaming wolfishly. 
She pointed down into the pit; 
spoke exultantly to the child. 

"Food!" said the last woman on 
earth. 



THE END 



Marley's Chain 

(Continued from page 35) 



Jackson's frightened face appeared 
briefly, then vanished. Finally Dave 
lifted a heavy fist, drove it hard into 
Tarn's stomach, then sadly lifted the 
choking, gasping man to the floor. 
The police came in, seconds later, 
clubs drawn, eyes wide. They 
dragged Tarn out, one on each arm. 
Dave sank back, his eyes filling, a 
sickness growing in the pit of his 
stomach. In court, a Sharkie would 
draw the maximum sentence, without leniency. Ten years in prison — 



Dave leaned forward, his face in his 
hands, tears running down his black 
cheeks, sobs shaking his broad, 
heavy shoulders. "Why wouldn't he 
listen? Why couldn't he have gone 
to Mercury? Only a few months, 
not long enough to hurt him. Why 
couldn't he have gone, and worked 
out in the sun, got that hot sun 
down on his hands and face — ^not 
for long, just for a little while. Two 
or three months, and he'd have 
been dark enough to pass — " 



THE END 



Conger agreed to kill a stranger he had 
never seen. But he would make no mistakes 
because he had the stranger's skull under 
his arm.

WHAT is this opportunity?" 
Conger asked. "Go on. I'm 
interested." 

The room was silent; all faces 
were fixed on Conger — still in the 
drab prison uniform. The Speaker 
leaned forward slowly. 

"Before you went to prison your 
trading business was paying well — 
all illegal — all very profitable. Now 
you have nothing, except the prospect of another six years in a cell. 

Conger scowled. 

"There is a pertain situation, very 
important to this Council, that requires your peculiar abilities. Also, 
it is a situation you might find interesting. You were a hunter, were you 



not?j You've done a great deal of 
trapping, hiding in the bushes, 
waiting at night for the game? I 
imagine hunting must be a source 
of satisfaction to you, the chase, the 
stalking — " 

Conger sighed. His lips twisted. 
"All right," he said. "Leave that 
out. Get to the point. Who do you 
want me to kill?" 6 , 

The Speaker smiled. "All in 
proper sequence," he said softly. 

The car slid to a stop. It was 
night; there was no light anywhere 
along the street. Conger looked out. 



"Where

The hand of the guard pressed 
into his arm. "Come. Through that 
door." 

Conger stepped , down, onto the 
damp sidewalk. The guard came 
swiftly after him, and then the 
Speaker. Conger took a deep breath 
of the cold air. He studied the dim 
outline of the building rising up 
before them. 

"I know this place. I've seen it 
before." He squinted, his eyes growing accustomed to the dark. Suddenly he became alert. "This is — " 

"Yes. The First Church." The 
Speaker walked toward the steps. 
"We're expected." 

"Expected? Here?" 

"Yes." The Speaker mounted the 
stairs. "You know we're not allowed 
in their Churches, especially with 
guns!" He stopped. Two armed soldiers loomed up ahead, one on each 
side. 

"All right?" The Speaker looked 
up at them. They nodded. The door 
of the Church was open. Conger 
could see other soldiers inside, 
standing about, young soldiers with 
large eyes, gazing at the ikons and 
holy images. 

"I see," he said. 

"It was necessary," the Speaker 
said. "As you know, we have been 
singularly unfortunate in the past 
in our relations" with the First 
Church." 

"This won't help." . 

"But it's worth it. You will see." 



THEY passed through the hall 
and into the main chamber 
where the altar piece was, and the 
kneeling places. The Speaker 
scarcely glanced at the altar as they 



passed- by. He pushed open a small 
side door and beckoned Conger 
through. 

"In here. We have to hurry. The 
faithful will be flocking in soon." 

Conger entered, blinking. They 
were in a small chamber, low-ceilinged, with dark panels of old 
wood. There was a smell of ashes 
and smoldering spices in the room. 
He sniffed. "What's that? The 
smell." 

"Cups on the wall. I don't 
know." The Speaker crossed impatiently to the far side. "According 
to our information, it is hidden here 
by this—" 

Conger looked around the room. 
He saw books and papers, holy 
signs and images. A strange low 
shiver went through him. 

"Does my job involve anyone of 
the Church? If it does — " 

The Speaker turned, astonished. 
"Can it be that you believe in the 
Founder? Is it possible, a hunter, a 
killer—" 

"No. Of course not. Ah their 
business about resignation to death, 
non-violence — " 

"What is it, then?" 

Conger shrugged. "I've been 
taught not to mix 7 with such as 
these. They have strange abilities. 
And you can't reason with them." 

The Speaker studied Conger 
thoughtfully. "You have .the wrong 
idea. It is no one here that we have 
in mind. We've found that killing 
them only tends to increase their 
numbers." 

"Then why come here? Let's 
leave." 

"No. We came for something 
important. Something you will need 
to identify your man. Without it 



THE SKULL 



109 



you won't be able to find him." 
A trace of a smile crossed the 
Speaker's face. "We don't want you 
to kill the wrong person. It's too 
important." 

"I don't make mistakes." Conger's chest rose. "Listen, Speaker — " 

"This is an unusual situation," 
the Speaker said. "You see, the person you are after — the person that 
we are sending you to find — is 
known only by certain objects here. 
They are the only traces, the only 
means of identification. Without 
them — " 

"What are they?" 

He came toward the Speaker. 
The Speaker moved to one side. 
"Look," he said. He drew a sliding 
wall away, showing a dark square 
hole. "In there." 

Conger squatted down, staring 
in. He frowned. "A skull! A skeleton!" 

"The man you are after has been 
dead for two centuries," the Speaker said. "This is all that remains of 
him. And this is all you have with 
which to find him." 

For a long time Conger said nothing. He stared down at the bones, 
dimly visible in the recess of the 
wall. How could a man dead centuries be killed? How could he ,be 
stalked, brought down? 

Conger was a hunter, a man who 
had lived as he pleased, where he 
'pleased. He had kept himself alive 
by trading, bringing furs and pelts 
in from the Provinces on his own 
ship, riding at high speed, slipping 
through the customs line around 
Earth. 

He had hunted in the great 
mountains of the moon. He had 
stalked through empty Martian 



cities. He had explored — 

The Speaker said, "Soldier, take 
these objects and have them carried to the car. Don't lose any part 
tof them." 

The soldier went into the cupboard, reaching gingerly, squatting 
on his heels. 

"It is my hope," the Speaker continued softly, to Conger, "that you 
will demonstrate your loyalty to us, 
now. There are always ways for 
citizens to restore themselves, to 
show their devotion to their society. 
For you I think this would be a 
very good chance. I seriously doubt 
that a better one will come. And 
for your efforts there will be quite 
a resitution, of course." 

The two men looked at each 
other; Conger, thin, unkempt, the 
Speaker immaculate in his uniform. 

"I understand you," Conger said. 
'T mean, I understand this part, 
about the chance. But how can a 
man who has been dead two centuries be — " 

"I'll explain later," the Speaker 
said. "Right now we have to hurry!" 
The soldier had gone out with the 
bones, wrapped in a blanket held 
carefully in his arms. The Speaker 
walked to the door. "Come. They've 
already discovered that we've 
broken in here, and they'll be coming at any moment." 

They hurried down the damp 
steps to the waiting car. A second 
later the driver lifted the car up 
into the air, above the house-tops. 



THE SPEAKER settled back in 
the seat. 
"The First Church has an interesting past," he said. "I suppose 



no 



PHILIP K. DICK 



you are familiar with it, but I'd 
like to speak of a few points that 
are of relevancy to us. 

"It was in the twentieth century 
that the Movement began — during" 
one of the periodic wars. The 
Movement developed rapidly, feeding on the general sense of futility, 
the realization that each war was 
breeding greater war, with no end 
in sight. The Movement posed a 
simple answer to the problem: 
Without military preparations — 
weapons — there could be no war. 
And without machinery and complex scientific technocracy there 
could be no weapons. 

"The Movement preached that 
you couldn't stop war by planning 
for it. They preached that man was 
losing to his machinery and science, 
that it was getting away from him, 
pushing him into greater and 
greater wars. Down with society, 
they shouted. Down with factories 
and science! A few more wars and 
there wouldn't be much left of the 
\yorld. 

"The Founder was an obscure 
person from a small town in the 
American Middle West. We don't 
even know his name. All we know 
is that one day he appeared, preaching a doctrine, of non-violence, nonresistance; no fighting, no paying 
taxes for guns, no research except 
for medicine. Live out your life 
quietly, tending your garden, staying out of public affairs ; mind your 
own business. Be 1 obscure, unknown, 
poor. Give away most of your possessions, leave the city. At least that 
was what developed from what he 
told the people." 

The car dropped down and 
landed on a roof. 



"The Founder preached this doctrine, or the germ of it; there's no 
telling how much the faithful have 
added themselves. The local authorities picked him up at once, of 
course. Apparently they were convinced that he meant it; he was 
never released. He was put to 
death, and his body buried secretly. 
It seemed that the cult was finished." 

The Speaker smiled. "Unfortunately, some of his disciples reported seeing him after the date of 
his death. The rumor spread; he 
had conquered death, he was divine. It took hold, grew. And here 
we are today, with a First Church, 
obstructing all social progress, destroying society, sowing the seeds 
of anarchy — " 

"But the wars," Conger said. 
"About them?" 

"The wars? Well, there were no 
more wars. It must be acknowledged that the elimination of war 
was the direct result of non-violence practiced on a general scale. 
But we can take a more objective 
view of war today. What Was so 
terrible about it? War had a profound selective value, perfectly in 
accord with the teachings of Darwin and Mendel and others. Without war the masS of useless, incompetent mankind, without training 
or intelligence, is permitted to grow 
and expand unchecked. War acted 
to reduce their numbers ; like storms 
and earthquakes and droughts, it 
was nature's way of eliminating the 
unfit. 

"Without war the lower elements 
of mankind have increased all out 
of proportion. They threaten the 
educated few, those with scientific 



THE SKULL 



111 



knowledge and training, the ones 
equipped to direct society. They 
have no regard for science or a 
scientific society, based on reason. 
And this Movement seeks to aid 
and abet them. Only when scientists 
are in full control can the — " 



HE LOOKED at his watch 
and then kicked the car door 
open. "I'll tell you the rest as we 
walk." 

They crossed the dark roof. 
"Doubtless you now know whom 
those bones belonged to, who it is 
that we are after. He has been dead 
just two centuries, now, this ignorant man from the Middle West, this 
Founder. The tragedy is that the 
authorities of the time acted too . 
slowly. They allowed him to speak, 
to get his message across. He was 
allowed to preach, to start his cult. 
And once such a thing is under way, 
there's no stopping it. 

"But what if he had died before 
he preached? What if none of his 
doctrines had ever been spoken? It 
took only a moment for him to utter 
them that, we know. They say he 
spoke just once, just one time. Then 
the authorities came, taking him 
away. He offered no resistance; the 
incident was small." 

The Speaker turned to Conger. 

"Small, but we're reaping the 
consequences of it today." 

They went inside the building. 
Inside, the soldiers had already laid 
out the skeleton on a table. The 
soldiers stood around it, their young 
faces intense. 

Conger went over to the table, 
pushing past them. He bent down, 
staring at the bones. "So these are 



his remains," he murmured. "The 
&>under. The Church has hidden 
them for two centuries." 

"Quite so," the Speaker said. 
"But now we have them. Come 
along down the hall." 

They went across the room to a 
door. The Speaker pushed it open. 
Technicians looked up. Conger saw 
machinery, whirring and turning; 
benches and retorts. In the center 
of the room was a gleaming crystal 
cage. 

The Speaker handed a Slem-gun 
to Conger. The important thing to 
remember is that the skull must be 
saved and brought back — for comparison and proof. Aim low — at the 
chest." 

Conger weighed the gun in his 
hands. "It feels good," he said. "I 
know this gun — that is, I've seen 
them before, but I never used one." 

The Speaker nodded. "You will 
be instructed on the use of the gun 
and the operation of the cage. You 
will be given all data we have on 
the time and location. The exact 
spot was a place called Hudson's 
field. About 1960 in a small community outside Denver, Colorado. 
And don't forget- — the only means 
of identification you will have will 
be the skull. There are visible characteristics of the front teeth, especially the left incisor — " 

Conger listened absently. He was 
watching two men in white carefully wrapping the skull in a plastic 
bag. They tied it and carried it into 
the crystal cage. "And if I should 
make a mistake?" 

"Pick the wrong man? Then 
find the right one. Don't come back 
until you succeed in reaching this 
Founder. And you can't wait for 



112 



PHILIP K. DICK 



him to start speaking; that's what 
we must avoid! You must act in 
advance. Take chances; shoot as 
soon as you think you've found him. 
He'll be someone unusual, probably 
a stranger in the area. Apparently 
he wasn't known." 

Conger listened dimly. 

"Do you think you have it all 
now?" the Speaker asked. 

"Yes. I think so." Conger entered 
the crystal cage and sat down, placing his hands on the wheel. 

"Good luck," the Speaker said. 

"We'll be awaiting the outcome. 
There's some philosophical doubt 
as to whether one can alter the 
past. This should answer the question once and for all." 

Conger fingered the controls of 
the cage. 

"By the way," the Speaker said. 
"Don't try to use this cage for purposes not anticipated in your job. 
We have a constant trace on it. If 
we want it back, we can get it back. 
Good luck." 

Conger said nothing. The cage 
was sealed. He raised his finger and 
touched the wheel control< He 
turned the wheel carefully. 

He was still staring at the plastic 
bag when the room outside vanished. 

For a long time there was nothing 
at all. Nothing beyond the crystal 
mesh of the cage. Thoughts rushed 
through Conger's mind, helterskelter., How would he know the 
man? How could he be certain, in 
advance? What had he looked like? 
What was his name? How had he 
acted, before he spoke? Would he 
be an ordinary person, or some 
strange outlandish crank? 

Conger picked up the Slem-gun 



and held it against his cheek. The 
metal of the gun was cool and 
smooth. He practiced moving the 
sight. It was a beautiful gun, the 
kind of gun he could fall in love 
with. If he had owned such a gun 
in the Martian desert — on the long 
nights when he had lain, cramped * 
and numbed with cold, waiting for 
things that moved through the 
darkness — 

He put the gun down and adjusted the meter readings of the 
cage. The spiraling mist was beginning to condense and settle. All at 
once forms wavered and fluttered 
around him. 

Colors, sounds, movements filtered through the crystal wire. He 
clamped the controls off and stood 
up. 



HE WAS on a ridge overlooking a small town. It was high 
noon. The air was crisp and bright. 
A few automobiles moved along a 
road. Off in the distance were some 
level fields. Conger went to the door 
and stepped outside. He sniffed the 
air. Then he went back into the 
cage. . 

He stood before the mirror over 
the shelf, examining his features. 
He had trimmed his beard — they 
had not got him to cut it off — and 
his hair was neat. He was dressed in 
the clothing of the middle-twentieth century, the odd collar and 
coat, the shoes of animal hide. In 
his pocket was money of the times. 
That was important. Nothing more 
was needed. 

Nothing, except his ability, his 
special cunning. But he had never 
used it in such a way before. 



THE SKULL 



113 



He walked down the road toward 
the town. 

' The first things he noticed, were 
the newspapers on the stands. 
April 5, 1961. He was not too far 
off. He looked around him. There 
was a filling station, a garage, some 
taverns, and a ten-cent store. Down 
the street was a grocery store and 
some public buildings. 

A few minutes later he mounted 
the stairs of the little public library 
and passed through the doors Into 
the warm interior. 

The librarian looked up, smiling. 

"Good afternoon," she said. 

He smiled, not speaking because 
his words would not be correct; accented and strange, probably. He 
went over to a table and sat down 
by a heap of magazines. For a moment he glanced through them. 
Then he was on his feet again. He 
crossed the room to a wide rack 
against the wall. His heart began 
to beat heavily. 

Newspapers — weeks on end. He 
took a roll of them over to the table 
and began to scan them quickly. 
The print was odd, the letters 
strange. Some of the words were 
unfamiliar. 

He set the papers aside and 
searched farther. At last he found 
what he wanted. He carried the 
Cherrywood Gazette to the table 
and opened it to the first page. He 
found what he wanted: 



PRISONER HANGS SELF 
An unidentified man, held 
by the county sheriff's office for 
suspicion of criminal syndicalism, was found dead this 
morning, by — 



He finished the item. It was 
vague, uninforming. He needed 
more. He carried the Gazette back 
to the racks and then, after a moment's hesitation, approached the 
librarian. 

"More?" he asked. "More papers. Old ones?" 

She frowned. "How old? Which 
papers?" 

"Months old. And— before." 

"Of the Gazette? This is all we 
have. What did you want? What 
are you looking for? Maybe I can 
help you." 

He was silent. 

"You might find older issues at 
the Gazette office," the woman 
said, taking off her glasses. "Why 
don't you try there? But if you'd tell me, maybe I could help you — " 

He went out. 

The Gazette office was down a 
side street; the sidewalk was broken 
and cracked. He went inside. A 
heater glowed in the corner of the 
small office. A heavy-set man stood 
up and came slowly over to the 
counter. 

"What did you want, mister?" 
he said. 

"Old papers. A month. Or 
more." 

"To buy? You want to buy 
them?" * 

"Yes." He held out some of the 
money he had. The man stared. 

"Sure," he said. "Sure. Wajt a 
minute." He went quickly out of 
the room. When he came back he 
was staggering under the weight of 
his armload, his face red. "Here 
are some," he grunted. "Took what 
I could find. Covers the whole 
year. And if you want more — " 

Conger carried the papers out

side. He sat down by the road and 
began to go through them. 



WHAT he wanted was four 
months back, in December. 
It was a tiny item, so small that he 
almost missed it. His hands trembled as he scanned it, using the 
small dictionary for some of the 
archaic terms. 

MAN ARRESTED FOR 
UNLICENSED 
DEMONSTRATION 
An unidentified man who 
refused to give his name was 
picked up in Cooper Creek by 
special agents of the sheriff's 
office, according to Sheriff 
Duff. It was said the man was 
recently noticed in this area 
and had been watched continually. It was — 

Cooper Creek. December, 1960. 
His heart pounded. That was all he 
needed to know. He stood up, shaking himself, stamping his feet on 
the cold ground. The sun had 
moved across the sky to the very 
edge of the hills. He smiled. Already he had discovered the exact 
time and place. Now he needed 
only to go back, perhaps to November, to Cooper Creek- — 

He walked back through the 
main section of town, * past the library, past the grocery store. It 
would not be hard; the hard part 
was over. He would go there; rent 
a room, prepare to wait urjtil the 
man appeared. 

He turned the corner. A woman 
was coming out of a doorway, 
loaded down with packages. Con


ger stepped aside to let her pass. 
The woman glanced at him. Suddenly her face turned white. She 
stared, her mouth open. 

Conger hurried on. He looked 
back. What was. wrong with her? 
The woman was still staring; she 
had dropped the packages to the 
ground. He increased his speed. He 
turned a second corner and went 
up a side street. When he looked 
back again the woman had come to 
the entrance of the street and was 
starting after him. A man joined 
her, and the two of them began to 
run toward him. 

He lost them and left the town, 
striding quickly, easily, up into the 
hills at the edge of town. When 
he reached the cage he stopped. 
What had happened? Was it something about his clothing? His dress? 

He pondered. Then, as the sun 
set, he stepped into the cage. 

Conger sat before the wheel. For 
a moment he waited, his hands 
resting lightly on the control. Then 
he turned the wheel, just a little, 
following the control readings carefully. 

The grayness settled down 
around him. 

But not for very long. 



THE man looked him over critically. "You better conie inside," 
he said. "Out of the cold." 

"Thanks." Conger went gratefully through the open door, into the 
livingroom. It was warm and close 
from the heat of the little kerosene 
heater in the corner. A woman, 
large and shapeless in her flowered 
dress, came from the kitchen. She 
and the man studied him critically. 



THE SKULL 



115 



"It's a good room," the woman 
said. "I'm Mrs. Appleton. It's got 
heat. You need that this time of 
year." 

"Yes." He nodded, looking 
around. 

"You want to eat with us?" 

"What?" 

"You want to eat with us?" The" 
man's brows knitted. "You're not a 
foreigner, are you, mister?" 

"No." He smiled. "I was born in 
this country. Quite far west, 
though." 

"California?" 

"No." He hesitated. "In Oregon." 

"What's it like up" there?" Mrs. 
Appleton asked. "I hear there's a 
lot of trees and green. It's so barren here. I come from Chicago, myself." 

"That's the Middle West," the 
man said to her. "You ain't no foreigner." 

"Oregon isn't foreign, either," 
Conger said. "It's part of the United States." 

The man nodded absently. He 
was staring at Conger's clothing. 

"That's a funny suit you got on, 
mister," he said." "Where'd you get 
that?" 

Conger was lost. He shifted uneasily. "It's a good suit," he said, 
"Maybe I better go some other 
place, if you don't want me here." 

They both raised their hands protestingly. The woman smiled at him. 
"We just have to look out for those 
Reds. You know, the government 
is always warning us about them." 

"The Reds?" He was puzzled. 

"The government says they're all 
around. We're supposed to report 
anything strange or unusual, anybody doesn't act normal." 



"Like me?" 

They looked embarrassed. "Well, 
you don't look like a Red to me," 
the man said. "But we have to be 
careful. The Tribune says — " 

Conger half listened. It was going 
to be easier than he had thought. 
Clearly, he would know as soon as 
the Founder appeared. These people, so suspicious of anything different would be buzzing and gossiping 
and spreading the story. All he had 
to do was lie low and listen, down 
at the general store, perhaps. Or 
even here, in Mrs. Appleton's 
boarding house. 

"Can I see the room?" he said. 

"Certainly." Mrs. Appleton went 
to the stairs. "I'll be glad to show 
it to you." 

They went upstairs. It was colder 
upstairs, but not nearly as cold as 
outside. Nor as cold as nights on 
the Martian deserts. For that he was 
grateful. 

He was walking slowly around 
the store, looking at the cans of 
vegetables, the frozen packages of 
fish and meats shining and clean in 
the open refrigerator counters. 

Ed. Davies came toward him. 
"Can I help you?" he said. The man 
was a little oddly dressed, and with 
a beard! Ed couldn't help smiling. 

"Nothing," the man said in a 
funny voice. "Just looking." 

"Sure," Ed said. He walked back 
behind the counter. Mrs. Hacket 
was wheeling her cart up. 

"Who's he?" she whispered, her 
sharp face turned, her nose moving, 
as if it were sniffing. "I never seen 
him before." 

"I don't know." 

"Looks funny to me. Why does

PHILIP K. DICK 



he wear a beard? No one else wears 
a beard. Must be something the 
matter with him." 

"Maybe he likes to wear a beard. 
I had an uncle who — " 

"Wait." Mrs. Hacket stiffened. 
"Didn't that — what was his name? 
The Red — that old one. Didn't he 
have a beard? Marx. He had. a 
beard." 

pd laughed. "This ain't Karl 
Marx. I saw a photograph of him 
once." 

Mrs. Hacket was staring at him. 
"You did?" 

"Sure." He flushed a little. 
"What's the matter with that?" 

"I'd sure like to know more about 
him," Mrs. Hacket said. "I think 
we ought to know more, for our 
own good." 



ii 



Want a 



HI 
ride?" 

Conger turned quickly, dropping 
his hand to his belt. He relaxed. 
Two young kids in a car, a girl and 
a boy. He smiled at them. "A ride? 
Sure." 

Conger got into the car and 
closed the door. Bill Willet pushed 
the gas and the car roared down 
the highway. 

"I appreciate a ride," Conger 
said carefully. "I was taking a walk 
between towns, but it was farther 
than I thought." 

"Where are you from?" Lora 
Hunt asked. She was pretty, small 
and dark, in her yellow sweater and 
blue skirt. 

"From Cooper Creek." 

"Cooper Creek?" Bill said. He 
frowned. "That's funny. I don't remember seeing you before." 



"Why, do you come from there?/' 

"I was born there. I know everybody there." 

"I just moved in. From Oregon." 

"From Oregon? I didn't know 
Oregon people had accents." 

"Do I have an accent?" 

"You use words funny." 

"How?" 

"I don't know. Doesn't he, 
Lora?" 

"You slur them," Lora said, smiling. "Talk some more. I'm interested in dialects." She glanced at 
him, white-teethed. Cqnger felt his 
heart constrict. 

"I have a speech impediment." 

"Oh." Her eyes widened. "I'm 
sorry." 

They looked at him curiously as 
the car purred along. Conger for his 
part was struggling to find some way 
of asking them questions without 
seeming curious. "I guess people 
from out of town don't come here 
much," he said. "Strangers." 

"No." Bill shook his head. "Not 
very much." 

"I'll bet I'm the first outsider for 
a long time." 

"I guess so." 

Conger hesitated. "A friend of 
mine — someone I know, might be 
coming through here. Where do 
you suppose I might — " He stopped. 
"Would there be anyone certain to 
see him? Someone I could ask, 
make sure I don't miss him if he 
comes?" 

They were puzzled. "Just keep 
your eyes open. CooperCreek isn't 
very big." 

"No.' That's right." 

They drove in silence. Conger 
studied the outline of the girl. Probably she was the boy's mistress. Per


THE SKULL 



117 



haps she was his trial wife. Or had 
they developed trial marriage back 
so far? He could not remember. 
But surely such an attractive girl 
would be someone's mistress by 
this time; she would be sixteen or 
so, by her looks. He might ask her 
sometime, if they ever met again. , 



THE NEXT day Conger went 
walking along the one main 
street of Cooper Creek. He passed 
the general store, the two filling stations, and then the post office. At 
the corner was the soda fountain. 

He stopped. Lora was sitting inside, talking to the clerk. She was 
laughing, rocking back and forth. 

Conger pushed the door open. 
Warm air rushed around him. Lora 
was drinking hot chocolate, with 
whipped cream. She looked up in 
surprise as he slid into the seat beside her. 

"I beg your pardon," he said. 
"Am I intruding?" 

"No." She shook her head. Her 
eyes were large and dark. "Not at 
all." 

The clerk came over. "What do 
you want?" 

Conger looked at the chocolate. 
"Same as she has." 

Lora was watching Conger, her 
arms folded, elbows on the counter. 
She smiled at him. "By the way. 
You don't know my name. Lora 
Hunt." 

She was holding out her hand. 
He took it awkwardly, not knowing 
what to do with it. "Conger is my 
name," he murmured. 

"Conger? Is that your last or first 
name?" 

"Last or first?" He hesitated. 



"Last. Omar Conger." 
_ "Omar?" She laughed. "That's 
like the poet, Omar Khayyam." 

"I don't know of him. I know 
very little of poets. We restored 
very few works of art. Usually only 
the Church has been interested 
enough — " He broke off. She was 
staring. He flushed. "Where I 
come from," he finished. 

"The Church? Which church do 
you mean?" 

"The Church." He was confused. 
The chocolate came and he began 
to sip it gratefully. Lora was still 
watching him. 

"You're an unusual person," she 
said. "Bill didn't like you, but he 
never likes anything different. He's 
so — so prosaic. Don't you think 
that when a person gets older he 
should become — broadened in his 
outlook?" 

Conger nodded. 

"He says foreign people ought 
to stay where they belong, not come 
here. But you're not so foreign. He 
means orientals; you know." 

Conger nodded. 

The screen door opened behind 
them. Bill came into the room. He 
stared at them. "Well," he said. 

Conger turned. "Hello." 

"Well." Bill sat down. "Hello, 
Lora." He was looking at Conger. 
"I didn't expect to see you here." 

Conger tensed. He could feel the 
hostility of the boy. "Something 
wrong with that?" 

"No. Nothing wrong with it." 

There was silence. Suddenly Bill 
turned to Lora. "Come on. Let's 

g°
"Go?" She was astonished. 
"Why?" 

"Just go!" He grabbed her hand. 



118 



PHILIP K. DICK 



"Come on! The car's outside." 

"Why, Bill Willet," Lora said. 
"You're jealous!" 

"Who is this guy?" Bill said. "Do 
you know anything about him? 
Look at him, his beard — " 

She flared. "So what? Just because he doesn't drive a Packard 
and go to Cooper High!" 

Conger sized the boy up. He was 
big — big and strong. Probably he 
was part of some civil control organization. 

"Sorry," Conger said. "I'll go." 

"What's your business in town?" 
Bill* asked. "What are you doing 
here? Why are you hanging around 
Lora?" 

Conger looked at the girl. He 
shrugged. "No reason. I'll see you 
later." 

He turned away. And froze. Bill 
had moved. Conger's fingers went 
to his belt. Half pressure, he whispered to himself. No more. Half 
pressure. 

He squeezed. The room leaped 
around him. He himself was protected by the lining of his clothing, 
the plastic sheathing inside. 

■My God — " Lora put her hands 
up. Conger cursed. He hadn't 
meant any of it for her. But it would 
wear off. There was only a halfamp to it. It would tingle. 

Tingle, and paralyze. 

He walked out the door without 
looking back. He was almost to the 
corner when Bill came slowly out, 
holding onto the wall like a drunken man. Conger went on. 



AS Conger walked, restless, in 
the night, a form loomed in 
front of him. He stopped, holding 



his breath. 

"Who is it?" a man's voice came. 
Conger waited, tense. 

"Who is it?" the man said again. 
He clicked something in his hand. 
A light flashed. Conger moved. 

"It's me," he said. 

"Who is 'me'?" 

"Conger is my name. I'm staying 
at the Appleton's place. Who are 
you?" 

The man came slowly up to him. 
He was wearing a leather jacket. 
There was a gun at his waist. 

"I'm Sheriff Duff. I think you're 
the person I want to talk to. You 
were in Bloom's today, about three 
o'clock?" 

"Bloom's?" 

"The fountain. Where the kids 
hang out." Duff came up beside 
him, shining his light into Conger's 
face. Conger blinked. 

"Turn that thing away," he said. 

A pause. "All right." The light 
flickered to the ground. "You were 
there. Some trouble broke out between you and the Willet boy. Is 
that right? You had a beef over his 
girl-" 

"We had a discussion," Conger 
said carefully. 

"Then what happened?" 

"Why?" 

"I'm just curious. They say you 
did something." 

"Did something? Did what?" 

"I don't know. That's what I'm 
wondering. They saw a flash, and 
something seemed to happen. They 
all blacked out. Couldn't move." 

"How are they now?" 

"All right." 

There was silence. 

"Well?" Duff said. "What was 
it? A bomb?" 



THE SKULL 



119 



"A bomb?" Conger laughed. 
"No. My cigarette lighter caught 
fire. There was a leak, and the fluid 
ignited." 

"Why did they all pass out?" 

"Fumes." 

Silence. Conger shifted, waiting. 
His fingers moved slowly toward his 
belt. The Sheriff glanced down. He 
grunted. 

"If you say so," he said. "Anyhow, there wasn't any real harm 
done." He stepped back from Conger. "And that Willet is a troublemaker." 

"Good night, then," Conger said. 
He started past the Sheriff. 

"One more thing, Mr. Conger. 
Before you go. You don't mind if I 
look at your identification, do you?" 

"No. Not at all." Conger reached 
into his pocket. He held his wallet 
out. The Sheriff took it and shined 
his flashlight on it. Conger watched, 
breathing shallowly. They had 
worked hard on the wallet, studying 
historic documents, relics of the 
times, all the papers they felt would 
be relevant. 

Duff handed it back. "Okay. Sorry to bother you." The light winked 
off. 

When Conger reached the house 
he found the Appletons sitting 
around the television set. They did 
not look up as he came in. He lingered at the door. 

"Can I ask you something?" he 
said. Mrs. Appleton turned slowly. 
"Can I ask you — what's the date?" 

"The date?" She studied him. 
"The first of December." 

"December first! Why, it was 
just November!" 

They were all looking at him. 
Suddenly he remembered. In the 



twentieth century they still used the 
old twelve month system. November fed directly into December; 
there was no Quartember between. 
He gasped. Then it was tomorrow! The second of December! 
Tomorrow! 

"Thanks," he said. "Thanks." 
He went up the stairs. What a 
fool he was, forgetting. The Founder had been taken into captivity on 
the second of December, according 
to the newspaper records. Tomorrow, only twelve hours hence, the 
Founder would appear to speak to 
the people and then be dragged 
away. 



THE day was warm and bright. 
Conger's shoes crunched the 
melting crust of snow. On he went, 
through the trees heavy with white. 
He climbed a hill and strode down 
the other side, sliding as he went. 

He stopped to look around. Everything was silent. There was no 
one in sight. He brought a thin rod 
from his waist and turned the handle of it. For a moment nothing 
happened. Then there was a shimmering in the air. 

The crystal cage appeared and 
settled slowly down. Conger sighed. 
It was good to see it again. After 
all, it was his only way back. 

He walked up on the ridge. He 
looked around with some satisfaction, his hands on his hips. Hudson's field was spread out, all the 
way to the beginning of town. It 
was bare and flat, covered with a 
thin layer of snow. 

Here, the Founder would come. 
Here, he would speak to* fthem. 
And here the authorities would 



120 



PHILIP K. DICK 



take him. 

Only he would be dead before 
they came. He would be dead before he even spoke. 

Conger returned to the crystal 
globe. He pushed through the door 
and stepped inside. He took the 
Slem-gun from the shelf and 
screwed the bolt into place. It was 
ready to go, ready to fire. For a moment he considered. Should he have 
it with him? 

No. It might be hours before the 
Founder came, and suppose someone approached him in the meantime? When he saw the Founder 
coming toward the field, then he 
could go and get the gun. 

Conger looked toward the shelf. 
There was the neat plastic package. 
He took it down and unwrapped it. 

He held the skull in his hands, 
turning it over. In spite of himself, 
a Cold feeling rushed through him. 
This was the man's skull, the skull 
of the Founder, who was still alive, 
who would come here, this day, who 
would stand on the field not fifty 
yards away. 

What if he could see this, hfe 
own skull, yellow and eroded? Two 
centuries old. Would he still speak? 
Would he speak, if he could see it, 
the grinning, aged skull? What 
would there be for him to say, to 
tell the people? What message 
could he bring? 

What action would not be futile, 
when a man could look upon his 
own aged, yellowed skull? Better 
they should enjoy their temporary 
lives, while they still had them to 
enjoy. 

A man who could hold his own 
skull in his hands would believe in 
few causes, few movements. Rather, 



he would preach the opposite — 

A sound. Conger dropped the 
skull back on the shelf and took up 
the gun. Outside something was 
moving. He went quickly to the 
door, his heart beating. Was it he? 
Was it the Founder, wandering by 
himself in the cold, looking for a 
place to speak? Was he meditating 
over his words, chosing his sentences? 

What if he could see what Conger had held! 

He pushed the door operi, the 
gun raised. 

Lora! 

He stared at her. She was dressed 
in a wool jacket and boots, her 
hands in her pockets. A cloud of 
steam came from her mouth and 
nostrils. Her breast was rising and 
falling. 

Silently, they looked at each 
other. At last Conger lowered the 
gun. 

"What is it?" he said. "What are 
you doing here?" 

She pointed. She did not seem 
able to speak. He frowned; what 
was wrong with her? 

"What'is it?" he said. "What do 
you want?" He looked in the direction she had pointed. "I don't see 
anything." 

"They're coming." 

"They? Who? Who are coming?" 

"They are. The police. During 
the night the Sheriff had the state 
police send cars. All around, everywhere. Blocking the roads. There's 
about sixty of them coming. Some 
from town, some around behind." 
She stopped, gasping. "They said — 
they said — " 

"What?" 



THE SKULL 



121 



"They said you were some kind 
of a Communist. They said — -" 



CONGER went into the cage. 
He put the gun down on the 
shelf and came back out. He leaped 
down and went to the girl. 

"Thanks. You came here to tell 
me? You don't believe it?" 

"I don't know." 

"Did you come alone?" 

"No. Joe brought me in his truck. 
From town." 

"Joe? Who's he?" 

"Joe French. The plumber. He's 
a friend of Dad's." 

"Let's go." They crossed the 
snow, up^ the ridge and onto the 
field. The little panel truck was 
parked half way across the field. A 
heavy short man was sitting behind 
the wheel, smoking his pipe. He sat 
up as he saw the two of them coming toward him. 

"Are you the one?" he said to 
Conger. 

"Yes. Thanks for warning me." 

The plumber shrugged. "I don't 
know anything about this. Lora 
says you're all right." He turned 
around. "It might interest you to 
know some more of them are coming. Not to warn you — Just 
curious." 

"More of them?" Conger looked 
toward the town. Black shapes were 
picking their way across the snow. 

"People from the town. You can't 
keep this sort of thing quiet, not in 
a small town. We all listen to the 
police radio; they heard the same 
way Lora did. Someone tuned in, 
spread it around — " 

The shapes were getting closer. 
Conger could, make out a couple of 



them. Bill Willet was there, with 
some boys from the high school 
The Appletons were along, hanging 
back in the rear. 

"Even Ed Davies," Conger murmured. 

The storekeeper was toiling onto 
the field, with three or four other 
men from the town. 

"All curious as hell," French 
said. "Well, I guess I'm going back 
to town. I don't want my truck shot 
full of holes. Come on, Lora." 

She was looking up at Conger, 
wide-eyed. 

"Come on," French said again. 
"Let's go. You sure as hell can't 
stay here, you know." 

"Why?" 

"There may be shooting. That's 
what they all came to see. You 
know that don't you, Conger?"' 

"Yes." 

"You have a gun? Or don't you 
care?" French smiled a little. 
"They've picked up a lot of people 
in their time, you know. You won't 
be lonely." 

He cared, all right! He had to 
stay here, on the field. He couldn't 
afford to let them take him away. 
Any minute the Founder would appear, would step onto the field. 
Would he be one of the townsmen, 
standing silently at the foot of the 
field, waiting, watching? 

Or maybe he was Joe French. Or 
maybe one of the cops. Anyone of 
them might find himself moved to 
speak. And the few words spoken 
this day were going to be important 
for a long time. 

And Conger had to be there, 
ready when the first word was 
uttered ! 

"I care," he said. "You go on 



122 



PHILIP K. DICK 



back to town. Take the girl with 
you." 

Lora got stiffly in beside Joe 
French. The plumber started up 
the motor. "Look at them, standing 
there," he said. "Like vultures. 
Waiting to see someone get 
killed." 



THE truck drove away, Lora sitting stiff and silent, frightened 
now. Conger watched for a moment. Then he dashed back into the 
woods, between the trees, toward 
the ridge. 

He could get away, of course. 
Anytime he wanted to he could get 
away. All he had to do was to leap 
into the crystal cage and turn the 
handles. But he had a job, an important job. He had to be here, 
here at this place, at this time. 

He reached the cage and opened 
the door. He went inside and 
picked up the gun from the shelf. 
The Slem-gun would take care of 
them. He notched it up to full 
count. The chain reaction from it 
would flatten them all, the police, 
the curious, sadistic people — 

They wouldn't take him! Before they got him;, all of them 
would be dead. He would get away. 
He would escape. By the end of the 
day they would all be dead, if that 
was what they wanted, and he — 

He saw the skull. 

Suddenly he put the gun down. 
He picked up the skull. He turned 
the skull over. He looked at the 
teeth. Then he went to the mirror. 

He held the skull up, looking in 
the mirror. He pressed the skull 
against his cheek. Beside his own 
face the grinning skull leered back 



at him, beside his skull, against his 
living flesh. 

He bared his teeth. And he knew. 

It was his Own skull that he held. 
He was the one who would die. He 
was the Founder. 

After a time he put the skull 
down. For a few minutes he stood 
at the controls, playing with them 
idly. He could hear the sound of 
motors outside, the muffled noise of 
men. Should he go back to the present, where the Speaker waited? He 
could escape, of course — 

Escape? 

He turned toward the skull. 
There it was, his skull, yellow with 
age. Escape? Escape, when he had 
held it in his own hands? 

What did it matter if he put it 
off a month, a year, ten years, even 
fifty? Time was nothing. He had 
sipped chocolate with a girl born a 
hundred and fifty years before his 
time. Escape? For a little while, 
perhaps. 

But he could not really escape, 
no more so than anyone else had 
ever escaped, or ever would. 

Only, he had held it in his hands, 
his own bones, his own death'shead. 

They had not. 

He went out the door and across 
the field, empty handed. There 
were a lot of them standing around, 
gathered together, waiting. They 
expected a good fight; they knew 
he had something. They had heard 
about the incident at the fountain. 

And there were plenty of police — 
police with guns and tear gas, creeping across the hills and ridges, between the trees, closer and closer. It 
was an old story, in this century. 

One of the men tossed something 



THE SKULL 



123 



at him. It fell in the snow by his 
feet, and he looked down. It was a 
rock. He smiled. 

"Come on!" one of them called. 
"Don't you have any bombs'?" 

"Throw a bomb! You with the 
beard! Throw a bomb!" 

"Let 'em have it!" 

"Toss a few A Bombs!" 



THEY began to laugh. He smiled. 
He put his hands to his hips." 
They suddenly turned silent, seeing 
that he was going to speak. 

"I'm sorry," he said simply. "I 
don't have any bombs. You're mistaken." 

There was a flurry of murmuring. 

"I have a gun," he went on. "A 
very good one. Made by science 
even more advanced than your 
own. But I'm not going to use that, 
either." 

They were puzzled. 

"Why not?" someone called. At 
the edge of the group an older 
woman was watching. He felt a 
sudden shock. He had seen her before. Where? 

He remembered. The day at the 
library. As he had turned the corner 
he had seen her. She had noticed 
him and been astounded. At the 
time, he did not understand why. 

Conger grinned. So he would 
escape death, the man who right 
now was voluntarily accepting it. 
They were laughing, laughing at a 
man who had a gun but didn't use 



it. But by a strange twist of science 
he would "" appear again, a few 
months later, after his bones had 
been buried under the floor of a 
jail. 

And so, in a fashion, he would 
escape death. He would die, .but 
then, after a period of months, he 
would live again, briefly, for an 
afternoon. 

An afternoon. Yet long enough 
for them to see him, to understand 
that he was still alive. To know that 
somehow he had returned to life. 

And then, finally, he would appear once more, after two hundred 
years had passed. Two centuries 
later. 

He would be born again, born, as 
a matter of fact, in a small trading 
village on Mars. He would grow up, 
learning to hunt and trade — 
A police car came on the edge of 
the field and stopped. The people 
retreated a little. Conger raised his 
hands. 

"I have an odd paradox for you," 
he said. "Those who take lives will 
lose their own. Those who ikill, will 
die. But he who gives his own life 
away will live again!" 

They laughed, faintly, nervously. 
The police were coming out, walking toward him. He smiled. He had 
said everything he intended to say. 
It was a good little paradox he had 
coined. They would puzzle over it, 
remember it. 

Smiling, Conger awaited a death 
foreordained. 



THE END 



It was like a mirage in reverse, this strange 
island off the California coast — it couldn't 
always 'be seen, but it was there — in Time. 




124 



Sinister Paradise 



By Robert Moore Williams 



THERE'S the island, Parker!" 
Retch called. 
Bill Parker shifted the controls 
of the 'copter and the big craft 
swung in the direction Retch was 
pointing. Squinting his eyes against 
the sun glare rising from the Pacific, 
Parker clearly saw the island. It was 
miles away as yet but it swam like 
a mirage suspended just above the 
surface of the sea. 






The island was not large — -Parker 
guessed it as probably being less 
than two miles in circumference — 
but he could make out a fringe of 
trees along the shore and a central 
peak rising like a cliff in the center. 

"I've found it again!" Retch 
spoke with fierce satisfaction — 
clenched fists. Parker heard the indrawn hiss of breath following the 
words; a hiss that seemed to hold 




125 



126 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



a promise for the future, Revenge, 
vengeance, triumph, or something 
else? Parker could not determine 
what emotional overtone had found 
expression in Retch's words. But the 
emotional overtone was there. Out 
of the corner of his eyes, Parker 
glanced at the man sitting in the 
seat next to him. What he saw did 
not please him. 

• Retch was big. He had the muscular build of a prize fighter. The 
scar over his left cheekbone did not 
add to the attractiveness of his appearance. He did not, in Tarker's 
opinion, look like the scientist he 
had claimed to be. 
I Parker shrugged such thoughts 
aside. What difference did it make 
what Retch was, or the nature of his 
business here? He had paid charter 
charges on the big helicopter. 

"There it is, Parker!" Retch almost screamed the words. As he 
pointed again toward the island in 
the far distance, Parker caught a 
glimpse of a pistol in a shoulder 
holster under the man's arm. 

The sight of the gun caused a 
split second of alarm in the big 
pilot. He had not known that Retch 
was armed. Then the alarm subsided. Parker pressed his left arm 
down against his body, assurring 
himself that his own gun was where 
it belonged. 

The woman, Mercedes Valdar, 
seemed to catch some of Retch's 
excitement. She leaned forward 
across Retch's shoulder to stare at 
the island. Parker caught another 
whiff of the musky perfume that 
she used. He noticed again what 
he had realized the first time he met 
her— that in any man's language 
she was a beauty. Aquiline face, 



smouldering black eyes, high cheek 
bones, a delicate brown complexion 
that hinted at Indian blood back 
several generations in the past, she 
looked like something out of an 
exotic movie. The slacks and sport 
coat that she wore accentuated the 
fact that she was a woman. 

Parker was aware again of the 
enigma of her presence. Retch had 
introduced her as his secretary. 
Parker, accepting the man's statement, had asked no questions. Asking questions in a matter such as 
this was a fine way to get a bust in 
the snoot. 

"It ees the island!" Her whisper 
was sharp. A glow appeared on 
her face. "Soon we will be reech!" 
She slapped Parker heartily on the 
shoulder. "Beel, is not that wonderful!" 

"It sure is," Parker answered. He 
was as astonished by the statement 
as he was by the slap on the shoulder. 

"Shut up, Mercedes!" Retch 
spoke. "Parker, turn some juice into 
this thing." 

"She's cruising at about her best 
speed," Parker answered. 

"Then get her faster than cruising speed. We've found the island." 
His manner indicated that finding 
the 'island was very important but 
that something else perhaps of equal 
importance remained to be done. 

"What's the big rush!" Parker 
countered. "You don't think it will 
vanish before we get there, do you?" 

A startled look appeared on 
Retch's face. "No, of course not. 
That is—" 

A thudding jar went through the 
ship. 

"What 'appened?" Mercedes 



SINISTER PARADISE 



127 



screamed in fear. 
, With a snarling crash of breaking 
metal, one of the helicopter blades 
was yanked from its mounting 
above them. 

Parker had the dazed impression 
that he saw the big blade jerked 
away through the air. Then, like a 
leaf suddenly caught in a violent 
hurricane, the helicopter began to 
turn flip-flops in the air. 

"Do somesing!" Mercedes cried. 

As the ship jumped and began to 
yaw, she was thrown across the 
cabin. Jerking, buckling, jumping, 
twisting, the big helicopter lurched 
its way toward the surface of the 
sea below. Cutting the power, 
Parker leaped from his seat. He 
knew what was going to happen. 
He intended to try and be ready for 
it. 



RETCH, gripping his seat with 
both hands, yelled. "We're 
falling!" 

"It's not news to me," Parker answered, jerking open the door to the 
compartment at the rear. Inside 
that compartment was a mass of 
synthetic fabric. Tossed to the surface of the sea, inflated by the selfcontained flask of gas under pressure, it would make a rubber raft. 

"You've left the controls!" Retch 
barked. "Do something to stop us. 
We're going to fall." The man's face 
was wild with fear as he twisted his 
head around to see what Parker was 
doing. 

"You damned right I've left the 
controls!" Parker answered. "We've 
lost the equivalent of a wing in an 
ordinary plane. If you know any 
way to stop a plane from falling 



you tell me." Working with deft, 
sure hands, he pulled the mass of 
synthetic fabric out of its compartment. 

"But we've got to get to that 
island. We've found it. We've got 
to get there while — " 

"If we get there, we'll have to 
swim," Parker answered. "Personally, I'll consider myself lucky to 
get there by swimming. Here we 
go." 

The last was spoken as the helicopter began its final plunge to the 
surface of the blue water below 
them. 

Parker, with the mass of fabric 
clutched firmly in both hands, 
threw himself flat on the floor. 

The 'copter hit with a terrific 
thud. An instant later, Parker was 
on his feet. The life raft was under 
one hand. With the other hand, he 
was reaching for the handle that 
opened the cabin door. 

"We've got to get out of here. 
This ship will go the bottom like 
a rock." 

Behind him, Mercedes and Retch 
were struggling to their feet. Parker 
yanked on the handle that opened 
the cabin door. 

The handle did not budge. 

The heavy jolt the craft had 
taken when it struck the surface had 
twisted the whole frame. 

"Get that door open!" Retch 
moaned. "We'll be drowned like 
rats." 

"Hell, I'm trying!" Parker answered. He yanked upward with all 
his strength. 

The door still did not budge. 

Outside Parker could see the 
green water rising around the cabin. 

He backed away, ducked hi* 



128 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



head, threw himself with all 
his strength against the door. 

Under the driving impact of his 
body, the door was knocked open. 
The mass of synthetic fabric in his 
arms, Parker catapulted through 
the opening and into the sea. He 
hit with a terrific splash. Mercedes 
followed him. Parker, treading 
water and working with the valve 
that would release the gas and inflate the raft, saw that Retch was 
still standing in the door of the 
'copter. 

"What am I going to do?" Retch 
screamed. 
"Jump." 

"But I can't swim." 
"Then wait until I get this goddamned raft inflated. tJgh!" Parker's voice went into silence as arms 
came up out of the water and closed 
around his neck with a grip of 
death. , 

Mercedes, in a panic that often 
comes to people catapulted suddenly and unexpectedly into the water, 
was grabbing the nearest source of 
potential safety. 

"Let go!" Even as he spoke, 
Parker felt her arms close even 
tighter around his neck. He knew 
then that she was not going to let 
go. She was pulling him under with 
her. 

Giving one final jerk at the valve 
of the gas container, Parker found 
himself pulled under water. 

The arms around his neck seemed 
to grip like iron. He caught them in 
both hands, yanked at them. His 
hands slipped. He grabbed again. 
She was behind him, on his back, so 
he could not slug her. Meanwhile 
each passing second was sending 
both of them deeper into the sea. 



He yanked at her arms again. This 
time his fingers held. Her grip was 
broken. 

Twisting, he grabbed her hair. 
Then he began to fight his way to 
the surface. 

His head broke water. As he 
gulped air, he realized the blessed 
sight before his eyes. 

The rubber raft! His last jerk at 
the valve before Mercedes dragged 
him under had opened it. 

From the door of the sinking 
helicopter Retch was staring at the 
raft. At the, same instant in final 
desperation, he jumped. His clutching fingers caught the edge of the 
rubber raft. Like a frightened river 
rat, he pulled himself out of the 
water. 



TREADING water, Parker 
dragged Mercedes to the edge 
of the raft. Retch leaned over and 
lifted her in. For an instant, Parker 
remained in the water, his fingers 
firm on the raft, letting it support 
him while he gasped air into his 
lungs. Behind him, with a gurgle 
and a rumble, the helicopter sank. 
He swung himself into the raft. 
Mercedes, her masculine garb clinging to her, was sitting up. 

"I am sorry, Beel," she said. "I 
get the scare up and I grab at you. 
I not know for sure what I am 
doing. You will forgive me, no?" 

"Think nothing of it," Parker answered. "Anybody can get scared 
under these circumstances." 

"That I know," she answered. 
"But you saved my life. And that I 
will remember." 

"Forget it," Parker said. "I did 



SINISTER PARADISE 



129 



what had to be done, nothing 
more." 

"But I will remember it," she 
calmly repeated. 

Parker was silent. Under her 
hardness for the first time he 
glimpsed something deeper, finer. 
She was the type who meant what 
she said. She was a woman who 
paid her debts. Under other circumstances . . . Parker put the 
thought out of his mind. 

Now he set about doing what had 
to be done — paddling to the island. 
He turned his eyes toward it. 

The island was gone. Calm, 
serene, the level face of the sea 
stretched away to the horizon. 

Fear, dark, sudden, and overwhelming, arose in Bill Parker. The 
fear did not come up just because 
the face of the sea was level 
and calm, the island not visible, 
but because of something else, 
something that he had forgotten, something that he had put out 
of his mind and out of his life. 
Could it be possible that — 

He caught himself. In that direction lay madness. Words exploded 
out of him. "Hey, what the hell? 
Am I nuts? What became of that 
island? I saw it!" 

"I told you we had to hurry to 
get there when we saw it." Retch 
was hesitant. "It's — it's not always 
there." 

"But it's got to be there! I saw 
it!" 

"There is a trick about that 
island," Retch said. "I — it — I — you 
don't always see it. Something funny." 

Parker was across the 'shaking, 
unsteady raft. His impulse was to 
take Retch by the throat, to shake 



words out of him. "What do you 
mean?" He was restraining himself 
with difficulty. 

Retch spread his hands. "I'm 
sorry, I can't explain. That's all I 
know. Believe me." 

Retch was telling the truth Parker decided. The big pilot swung his 
gaze in every direction, searching 
for land. Somewhere in the far distance was the peninsula of Lower 
California. But it was beyond 
range of his eyes. As far as he could 
see, was barren water. 

Setting his course by the small 
compass that was included as part 
of the standard equipment on the 
life raft, Parker paddled toward the 
south. The clumsy raft made little 
progress. Parker hardly noticed, 
hardly cared. Deep in his mind was 
a lurking thought he was trying to 
keep below his consciousness. 

In the front of the raft, Retch sat 
with his back to Parker. From 
Retch's motions, Parker knew the 
man was cleaning his gun. Parker 
made no comment. When Retch 
had finished and had turned back 
to him, Parker spoke. "I want to 
know a little more about that island. 
How does it happen we can't see 
it?" 

"I'm not- certain," Retch answered. "I think it's a lot like the 
mirages you see on the desert. This 
island is something like that, only 
in reverse. In a mirage, you see 
something that doesn't exist. In the 
case of this island, you don't see 
something that does exist." 

"Um," Parker said, then was silent. The explanation sounded reasonable enough, as far as it went. 
The trouble was it didn't go far 
enough, not nearly far enough to 



130 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



quiet the thought lurking deep in 
the big pilot's mind. He worked 
with the paddle. "When you hired 
me to fly you down here, you told 
me that you knew where this island 
was located but you didn't tell me 
it had a bad habit of vanishing." 

"I didn't believe it myself," Retch 
answered. "So far as I was concerned, it was just a wild rumor." 

"Urn," Parker said again. As he 
spoke, part of the thought that he 
had been keeping buried in his 
mind came blasting to the surface. 
"She said it was a mirage too!" he 
blurted out the words. "And that 
goddamned Dr. Yammer — " He 
caught himself. Into his mind had 
come a vision of a woman he had 
once known,, and a psychiatrist 
called Dr. Yammer. Pain crossed his 

"What?" Retch asked. "Who are 
you talking about?" 

"Nobody," Parker answered. 
"Just a woman I once knew." 

Her name had been Effra. Effra 
of the Green Eyes, he had called 
her. Rigidly he forced the thought 
of her from his mind, forced himself 
to think of what Retch had said. 
But it was no good. His mind kept 
going back to Effra and Yammer. 

"She is caught, trapped in a net 
of delusion and hallucination that 
is as solid as a block of steel," Dr. 
Yammer had once said, his voice 
precise with authoritarian certainty. 
"I cannot get her out of this steel 
block unless I hospitalize her, perhaps operate. There is no other 
choice, no other decision that can 
be made. Putting it bluntly — she is 
insane. A delicate thing, insanity. 
We still work in the dark with 
things of the mind." 



AT THE memory of Yammer's 
words, Parker twisted uncomfortably. He used the paddle much 
more vigorously than was necessary. 
It was as if Yammer's face showed 
in the water into which he thrust 
the paddle. 

Mercedes was studying Parker. 
"About this woman — " 

"She was just a woman I once 
knew." 

"You loved her, yes?" 

"Well — " Parker was silent. 

"Tell me what 'appened." 

"Nothing," Parker said. "Oh, hell 
— all right. Up in LA three years 
ago I knew Effra. She was a pilot 
too, and we got to running around 
together. She liked to fly out over 
the Pacific all by herself. I don't 
know why; she, just liked to flirt 
with danger, maybe. One time she 
came in a couple of hours over-due. 
Figuring she was down in the drink. 
I was about to rouse out the Navy 
to hunt for her when she came in." 
He paused. 

Mercedes was silent. In the front 
of the raft, Retch said nothing. His 
eyes were still searching the skyline. 

"She was wildly excited," Parker 
went on. "She said she had made a 
forced landing on an island somewhere off the coast of Southern Gal. 
She also said there were a lot of 
strange people living on the island." 
He shook his head. There was a 
feeling in him he did not like. 

His eyes came to focus on a ripple 
in the water. A shark. It made him 
think of Dr. Yammer. 

"What 'appened then?" Mercedes asked softly. 

"I helped her look for the island," 
Parker said. "We spent months 
looking in our spare time. We flew 



SINISTER PARADISE 



131 



over more ocean than I ever knew 
existed. But we didn't find it." 

"No?" 

"That island was awfully important to her. She thought something 
wonderful was there, what it was, 
she could not tell me, just that it 
was there. When we could not find 
it, she began to doubt herself, to 
think perhaps she had not seen it, 
that she had not landed there. She 
reached the conclusion then — well, 
she went to see one of these fancy 
mental specialists who know everything about nothing and nothing 
about anything." 

Under the water, he could see the 
eyes of the shark. They reminded 
him of the expression in Dr. Yammer's eyes, except that the shark's 
eyes looked more honest. 

"And then?" Mercedes said, very 
softly. 

"She — vanished," Parker said. 
"Yammer was going to stick her 
into a hospital, use something that 
he called 'shock' on her, maybe 
operate. She ran away." 

"Did you try to find her, Beel?" 

"For asking that question, Mercedes, I ought to choke you!" Parker said hotly. "I hunted high and 
low. All we knew for certain was 
that her plane was missing. I think 
she decided she would simply fly 
out to the sea she loved, and never 
come back." Again his voice sank to 
a whisper as he visualized Effra of 
the Green Eyes flying out over this 
wilderness of waters. 

"I am sorry, Beel," Mercedes said 
gently. "Will you remember one 
thing, Beel?" 

"Sure. What is it?" 

"You saved my life back there. 
I will not forget it. If the time ever 



comes, I will pay my debt." 

"Thank you," Parker said. "But 
there is no debt." 

"You think this island we are 
hunting might be the same island 
your . girl claimed she found?" 
Retch spoke from the front end of 
the boat. 

"And if it is the same island?" 
Mercedes said. 

Anger came boiling up in Parker. 
"If it is that island, and if I ever get 
back to Los Angeles, I am going to 
hunt up a psychiatrist by the name 
of Yammer and take care of him!" 
Parker dug the water savagely. 
Gradually, his anger subsided 
"Where did you run into the rumor 
about this island?" 

Retch shrugged. "It was just one 
of those things you hear." He 
studied the landscape. "We should 
spot a boat soon." 

"We are not exactly on the welltraveled ocean lanes," Parker 
pointed out. "Does it happen that 
there are any other little things 
about this island that you forgot to 
tell me when you chartered my ship 
to fly you down here?" 

Retch flushed. "Such as — " 

"Such as how it happened that 
my 'copter threw a vane just after 
we sighted the place?" 

Retch did not answer. 

"Seemed as though somebody 
shot at us." 

"Oh hell no! The loss of the vane 
was accidental." 

"Accidents like that can happen 
but they usually don't. I checked 
the ship before we took off." Parker 
turned silent. There was no proof 
that the wrecking of the 'copter 
had been anything but an accident. 
"What do you expect to find on 



132 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



this island?" 

"I told you—" 

"Just before the 'copter started 
down, Miss Valdar was yakking 
about how we were all going to be 
rich," Parker interrupted. 

The glance Retch gave Mercedes 
had no love in it. "Sometimes she's 
got her mouth open when she ought 
to have it shut." 



MERCEDES was silent. 
"I see," Parker said. 
"When you chartered my ship, you 
told me you were a scientist and 
that you wanted to investigate certain phenomena on this island. You 
said your investigation would take 
only a few hours. I was to fly you 
here and wait for you. You said you 
might want me to fly you back to 
the mainland, or might not, depending on what you found here. Is 
this correct?" 

"Certainly," Retch answered. 
"I'm sorry you lost your ship but the 
insurance will take care of it." 

"Insurance will take care of the 
'copter but not of my neck. Are 
you a scientist?" 

"Of course. Didn't I tell you—" 
"What kind of a scientist are 
you?" 

"I — ah— What do you mean?" 
"What's your specialty? Are you 
a biologist, a physicist, or what?" 

"I don't believe you ire a scientist 
at all. You don't talk like one." 

"Damn it, I told you what I am 
and that's what I am !" Retch's face 
showed sullen and his hand moved 
toward the gun. Parker tensed. 
Retch stopped the movement of his 
hand. He glared at the big pilot. 



"Okay," Parker said. "It doesn't 
make any difference anyhow." He 
resumed paddling. 

The sun slid down the western 
sky. Retch and Mercedes huddled 
in the front end of the raft and 
whispered to each other. From time 
to time, the woman glanced at 
Parker. He paid no attention to her. 

The sea was calm. In the distance, a school of flying fish skittered over the surface. A dozen gulls 
played near the surface. A highriding fin cut the water. Shark, 
sensing food. 

The sun reached the horizon and 
wallowed in the sea like a fat, round 
shining pig on fire. 

Mercedes screamed, pointed, 
jerked a terror-stricken face toward 
Parker. "Beel! Beel!" She scuttled 
across the raft, threw herself into 
his arms. "Look, Beel, look!" 

Terror and panic almost beyond 
understanding were in her words. 

Parker looked where she was 
pointing. His heart climbed up into 
his mouth and threatened to choke 
him. He had thought he was shockproof, that nothing could jar him. 
But here was something that made 
his mind reel. 

Walking across the water toward 
the raft were three men. 

Clad in knee-length breeches, 
wearing cloaks, the three men 
looked as if they had just stepped 
out of the 17th century. Two wore 
big, broad-brimmed hats, the third 
had a handkerchief wrapped 
around his head. He also had a 
wooden leg and he stalked across 
the surface of the sea with all the 
sureness he might have had with 
concrete under him. He carried a 
curved cutlass in one hand. The 



SINISTER PARADISE 



133 



other two men were armed with 
swords, in scabbards. In addition, 
heavy, . clumsy-looking pistols were 
thrust into sashes at their belts. 

They looked like men out of a 
nightmare- — or like pirates out of 
the olden days; swash-buckling 
buccaneers who had somehow managed to survive their proper period 
in history and to live into the 20th 
century. 

"Ghosts!" Mercedes screamed. 
"Devils! They've come up out of 
hell because of our sins!" She 
wrapped her arms around Parker's 
neck. "Save me, Beel, save me!" 

Parker caught her wrists, jerked 
her arms loose from his neck, and 
rose quickly to his feet. He hoped 
fervidly that his eyes had been deceiving him and that standing up 
would cause this mirage to disappear. 

His eyes continued to deceive 
him. The three men did not disappear. They continued to walk across 
the water toward the raft. They 
moved with the sureness of men 
who know where they are going. 

Behind them, suddenly outlined 
against the fat sun that was wallowing in the sea, rocky, grim, and forbidding, the mysterious island was 
now visible. It had reappeared. 
They had found it. 

Three men coming from it had 
found them. 

The shark found the three men. 

Parker saw the triangular fin cut 
through the water toward them. 
Like a speed boat taking off on a 
race, the fin gathered momentum. 

The three men saw it coming. 

"Ho!" one yelled. 

"A shark!" the second said. 



"Have at him, boys!" the third 
shouted. 



THE shark charged them. 
Drawing their swords, the 
three men executed a nimble dance 
on the surface of the sea. They 
thrust downward — their swords entering the water with no difficulty 
whatsoever although their feet did 
not enter it — drew them back dripping red. They skipped lightly out 
of the way of the wounded and infuriated monster^ 

"Zounds!" 

"Chop the sea pig down!" 

"Carve his heart out!" 

Old battle cries rang in the air 
as they fought the shark. Blood 
colored the surface of the sea. 

The wounded shark suddenly 
took its death blow. It dived, was 
gone from sight, then broke the surface a hundred yards away. It beat 
the water into foam, threshing out 
its life. 

With pleased interest, the three 
men watched the shark die. Dipping their blades into the sea to 
clean the blood from them, they 
wiped them dry on their pants legs. 

Again they moved toward the 
raft. 

Parker's hand went to the pistol 
inside his leather jacket. He loosed 
it in its holster but did not draw it. 

Mercedes moaned and covered 
her eyes. At the other end of the 
boat, Retch had risen to his feet. 

Bracing himself, Bill Parker 
waited for — whatever was to happen. Out of the corner of his eye, 
he saw Retch slowly drawing his 
gun. 

"Damn it, Retch, put that gun 



134 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



away!" Parker shouted. "Don't 
shoot until you know what the hell 
is going on." 

Retch turned, the gun visible in 
his hand. "What the hell—" 
Retch didn't put the gun away. He 
lifted it. Parker found himself staring into the muzzle. 

"Get your hands up!" Retch 
snarled the words. "Mercedes, get that gun out of his holster. Get your 
goddamned hands up or I'll blow 
your blasted head off!" 

The last was spoken to Parker 
as the dazed pilot tried to understand what had happened. He 
could hardly believe his own eyes. 
Automatically he lifted his hands. 
Mercedes slid past him, got behind 
him, taking no chances on getting 
between him and Retch's gun. He 
felt her fingers go inside his jacket. 
Expertly she lifted the gun from 
its holster. 

"Toss me the gun!" Retch said. 
He caught the weapon the woman 
tossed toward him, glanced at 
'Parker. "You thought I was going 
to start shooting at them?" He 
gestured toward the three approaching men. "You made a 
slight mistake." The grin on his 
face was wolfish. 

"What the hell have I got into?" 
"You'll find out, if you live long 
enough," Retch said. "Just behave 
yourself and do as you're told and 
maybe you'll stay alive." Again the 
wolfish grin showed on his face but 
under the grin, the words were 
harsh with meaning. 

"Ho, Johnny!" the three men 
were drawing near the raft. "Ho, 
Johnny Retch! What kind of m flying ship is this that you have 
brought back with you?" 



Retch turned to the three men. 
"Gotch! Peg-leg! Masterville!" 
Retch greeted them as old friends. 
The one he had called Gotch had 
spoken. All three of them stared at 
the raft and its occupants. Mercedes drew bold, appreciative 
stares. Parker got blank looks. 
Standing lightly and easily on the 
water, the three men surveyed the 
raft with doubtful contempt. 

"Does this thing fly through the 
air like the Jez — " Gotch caught 
himself. "It looks to me as if it were 
more fit for sailing on a mill pond 
back in Devon." 

"This is not the ship that flies 
through the air, that ship was 
wrecked. This is a rubber boat that 
it carried." 

"Wrecked?" Gotch spoke. "But 
where does that leave us?" 

"Everything has been taken care 
of," Retch spoke quickly. "You can 
always trust Johnny Retch to have 
two strings for his bow." 

"Hmmmm. And who is this?" 
Gotch gestured toward Parker. 

"The pilot of the flying ship that 
was wrecked," Retch answered. 

"Ummmm. And what are we going to do with him?" Gotch 
glanced around toward the still 
floundering and dying shark as if 
he regretted their haste in disposing of what might have been a 
handy scavanger. "Um." He moved 
around the raft and stood close to 
Parker, staring at him. The sword 
in his hands still showed faint 
traces of red from the blood of 
the shark. 

"We do not need any more men 
on the island!" Lifting his blade, 
Gotch glared at Parker. 

"Do you, per'aps, need women?" 



SINISTER PARADISE 



135 



Mercedes spoke quickly. Gotch 
turned his eyes on her. As he 
looked, some of the anger seemed 
to go out of him. 

"Perhaps what you need on the 
island are more women," Mercedes 
said. She smiled boldly. 



GOTCH broke into a grin. "But 
definitely, we need more women, if they are like you." 

"Hey, lay off of her, she belongs 
to me!" Retch spoke violently. 

"Come, let us pull the boat to 
the island," Peg-leg spoke quickly. 
"We have too many things to do 
to stand waiting here." 

Grumbling, Gotch allowed himself to be persuaded to get in front 
of the raft and join the other men 
in pulling it. 

Not until then did Parker dare to 
breathe. "Thanks," he spoke to 
Mercedes. 

"It was nothing, Beel. Anyone 
could have done it." 

"Thanks, anyhow," Parker said. 
"But what have we got ourselves 
into here?" 

"I do not know for sure, Beel. 
Johnny, he like me, and he ask me 
to come along. He say we will both 
get reech — " 

"Shut up!" Retch spoke. 

Parker, sitting in the raft, 
watched the three men tow it toward the shore. He watched their 
feet. Where they stepped, the water seemed to grow firm. Pirates, 
cut-throats, killers, they certainly 
were. But added to, that was the 
equally obvious fact that they could 
walk on water. In all history, 
Parker had only heard of one man 
who could do that, and he hadn't 



been a man, but a God. 

Ahead of them, the island 
loomed in the sunset; a long strip 
of white, sandy beach; behind it a 
thick growth of trees; behind the 
trees the rocky central mass of the 
island rising up into the sky. Off to 
the right, Parker caught a glimpse 
of a wreck that lay against rocks 
jutting from the shore. He stared at 
it. Unless his eyes were deceiving 
him, it was the wreck of a Spanish 
galleon, a ship that belonged to the 
days when Spain had been draining 
the gold and silver and jewels of 
the new -world into her coffers. 

The men stopped, stared uneasily at the shore. Parker could 
make out two men barely visible between the beach and the grove of 
trees. 

"Rozeno and Ulnar!" Gotch 
spoke. "Watching us." His lips 
curled and his hand went automatically to the hilt of the sword 
he was wearing. "Some day I will 
slit the throats of that priest and 
that Indian." Gotch spat into the 
sea. 

"They're not causing any trouble," Peg-leg spoke. 

"They're witches, by Gad 8 !" 
Gotch answered. "They're warlocks, wizards." 

"Father Rozeno is a very devout 
and holy man," Peg-leg said. 

"He pretends to be a priest but 
he is more of a warlock than he is 
a holy man. As for that Indian, if 
he ever gives me the chance — " 
Gotch 'glared at the figures at the 
edge of the grove. 

"Come on," Peg-leg said. 

Mercedes contrived to move 
closer to Parker. "Beel, what are 
theese theengs here? I do not un


136

derstand them. I do not like them." 

"Nor do I," Parker said. 

A shiver passed over her. 

"What's the matter, baby, you 
cold?" Retch grinned at her. 
"Don't worry about it. We'll get you 
warmed up on the island." 

Imperceptibly she again moved 
closer to Parker. "Beel, it ees not 
good" 

"You got into this of your own 
free will." 

"Yes, but I did not know that 
theengs like theese were going to 
'appen. I just thought — " 

"Mercedes, if you open your 
mouth again, I'll knock your teeth 
down your throat!" Retch said. 

Mercedes was silent. 

As they came in to the shore, the 
two men who had beeji visible on 
the beach disappeared. Off to the 
left something else came into view. 
It was a small cabin plane, wrecked 
there in what had apparently been 
an attempt at a forced landing. 

Before they reached the shore, 
the fat sun had wallowed itself out 
of sight into the sea. In the dusk, 
the island looked like a vast, rocky 
pinnacle thrust up out of the Paline Ocean, or out of the ocean of 
time — Parker couldn't tell which. 
Mysterious, silent, it waited in the 
darkness like a vast sleeping monster on the surface of the sea, a 
monster on which Spanish galleons 
and planes had been wrecked. 
Parker, his nerves jumpy, half-way 
expected it to vanish beneath the 
surface before they reached it. 

But it didn't vanish. It remained 
fixed, solid, firm. When they 
stepped from the raft, the sand under their feet was solid, the crunch 
of it reassuring. 



A BREEZE whispered through 
the trees. The island was 
quiet, too quiet. It seemed to brood 
in the darkness. In the vast stillness 
that hung like a pall over the place, 
the only sound was that of a bird, 
chittering sleepily in the dark 
woods. 

It was the most out-of-place 
sound Bill Parker had ever heard. 

It seemed to affect the others. At 
the bird-sound they were suddenly 
quiet, listening. 

"To hell with it, it's nothing," 
Gotch said. "Come on." 

Following a well defined path, 
they moved inland, toward the base 
of the cliff. Through the trees, 
Parker glimpsed fires. As he moved 
closer, he saw the source of the 
lights, the cooking fires of a village 
set against the base of the cliff. 

"Ho!" Peg-leg called, announcing their arrival. 

As they entered the village, the 
inhabitants came rushing out to 
them. They were the queerest lot 
of human beings Parker had ever 
seen. Spaniards, bearded grandees 
in tattered and mended bits of ancient finery, Indians, squat, stalwart, Englishmen, tall and blond, 
a motley crew. 

They looked like the relics of 
half a dozen different nations, 
drawn from the fringes of time. 
Their garments did not belong in 
the 20th century. Their weapons 
were knives, swords, bell-mouthed 
pistols. Their language was a mixture of Spanish, English, Portuguese, and Indian dialects. 

"What kind of a mad-house is 
this?" Parker muttered. "Get away, 
you!" The last was spoken to a 
slender Spaniard who was trying to 



SINISTER PARADISE 



137 



jerk Parker's leather jacket from 
his back. 

The man snarled at him, drew 
back. 

"Get out of our way!" Retch 
yelled. The crowd made way for 
him. Calling greetings, snarling, 
Retch seemed very much at home 
here. 

Mercedes looked hopelessly confused and at a loss. She stared 
around her as if she was appalled 
at what she saw. Parker drew the 
obvious inference. Mercedes had 
never been here before. All this was 
as new to her as it was to him. But 
Retch had been here. 

Off in the woodland behind them 
somewhere a bird chirped, the same 
sleepy quiet sound that Parker had 
heard as they landed. Now it was 
louder, nearer, and even more out 
of place than it had been before. 

The people around Parker also 
heard the sound. Startled faces 
turned toward the dark forest. 

The sound came again, louder 
now. Parker was certain it was the 
call of a bird. 

But if it was the chirp of a bird, 
it was frightening these people. 
Why should a bird-sound in the 
night frighten grown men? Utter 
silence fell. Even Gotch was still. 
Parker saw that the man's face had 
turned gray, that all the bristling 
bravado had passed out of him. 

Even Retch, showing signs of 
strain and growing temper, was silent. 

"The Jezbro!" someone whispered. 

At the words, the strain and temper coming up in Retch burst the 
surface. "There is no such thing as 
the Jezbro!" His voice was almost 



a scream. "It's only superstitious 
nonsense — " His shouting voice 
went into silence as the sound came 
again. 

The chirp was louder now. It 
was no longer one bird chirping in 
the dark night, it was a dozen. And 
it wasn't quite the sound of a bird 
any longer, it was a musical tinkle, 
an air-borne throbbing somewhat 
similar to the sound of a harp, a 
softly ringing chime. Parker could 
easily imagine that somewhere 
among those dark trees was a 
harper, moving closer. 

The harpist did not seem to be 
upon the ground. He — or she — 
seemed to be up in the air, somewhere near the tree tops, moving in 
the dark night. 

As the sound came louder, a man 
in the village suddenly went down 
on his knees, then another and another, until the whole group, including Gotch, were kneeling. Evjftn 
Mercedes went to her knees in response to deep internal, superstitious pressures. Only Retch and 
Parker stood erect as two men 
strong enough to face the sound 
coming from the night. 

"Get down, you fools!" Peg-leg's 
voice had real anguish in it. 

"Get down, hell!" Retch answered. He had a gun in each hand, 
his own and the one he had taken 
from Parker. 

"Beel! Beel!" Mercedes was jerking at Parker's l^g, "What is 
'appening?" 

"Something," Parker answered. 
"I don't know what." There was 
fear in him. He could feel it in his 
heart, sense it in his bones, taste in 
his mouth. He rose above it. 

The sound swept through the air. 



138 



' ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



It came out over the trees above 
them. On the ground, the kneelers 
moaned in response. 

The harping sound leaped up, 
became a melody of weird notes 
filling the night air. Mingled with 
the eerie music were the moans 
from the prostrate humans. 

Looking upward, Parker caught 
a glimpse of something moving 
through the sky. It blotted out the 
light of the stars and it looked a lot 
like a bird but like no bird he had 
ever seen before. It was too big to 
be any bird that had ever flown 
through Earth's air, but yet it flew. 
As it flew, it made the sound of a 
gigantic harp. 



THE bird passed over the village, moving along the cliff. 
As it slid into the distance, the harp 
music faded slowly away, became 
again the sound of a sleepy bird. 

Around the village, the prostrate 
humans moaned, stirred, began to 
rise. 

"What the hell was that thing?" 
Parker gasped. 

"The damned fools call it the 
Jezbro!" Retch snarled. "The yellow cowards are afraid of it. I don't 
know what it is." 

Parker was silent. To him, Retch 
sounded like a man scared right 
down to the soles of his shoes but 
desperately trying to pretend he 
wasn't. 

"It was a warning sent by them," 
Peg-leg whispered, gesturing up 
toward the cliff in the darkness. "A 
warning to us to mend our ways." 

"It was no such thing!" Retch 
shouted. 

Peg-leg did not argue. He got 



slowly and silently to his feet. The 
group was silent, perturbed, and 
afraid. Even Gotch was silent. 
Whatever had passed overhead, 
had cast a pall of fear over them. 

"You bilious, yellow-livered cowards!" Retch raged at them. 

They made no response. The fear 
the Jezbro had inspired in them 
seemed to have made even his anger 
unimportant. 

"But what is the Jezbro?" Parker 
questioned again. "I mean — " 

"I told you it's nothing and that's 
enough of an answer. Hey!" The 
guns that Retch held came up 
sharply as another figure came 
soundlessly out of the forest and 
moved toward them. An old, bent, 
wrinkled Indian who hobbled along 
with the aid of a staff. 

"Oh, it's you, Pedro!" Retch 
said. "What the hell do you want?" 

For all the sign he gave, the Indian, Pedro, did not hear Retch's 
question. He hobbled straight to 
Parker. 

"En la manana Padre Rozeno 
huit nole el hombre e la mujer. 
Father Rozeno will see the man and 
the woman in the morning." The 
voice was broken with age. 

"I don't get it," Parker said. The 
Indian was already turning. He had 
delivered his message, his errand 
was finished. 

"That damned Rozeno is not go-^ 
ing to see anybody in the morning!" 
Retch yelled. 

The Indian staffed his way into 
the forest. He still seemed not to 
hear Retch. 

"Tell him they won't be there!" 
Retch screamed. 

Pedro's back went out of the firelight as he moved into the trees. 



SINISTER PARADISE 



139 



Retch seemed almost to go mad. 
His face turned purple. Both guns 
came to focus on the spot where the 
Indian had disappeared. 

"Why shoot him?" Parker said. 
"He was just a messenger." 

"Damn it!" Slowly, while the 
group watched impassively, Retch 
got himself under control. Suddenly he began to laugh. Strangely his 
laughter in this moment was more 
horrible than his anger had been. 

"He sent for you, and the woman. 
All right, he'll get you. But I'll go 
with you. If he wants you, I'll take 
you to him." Again the laughter 
sounded. 

"Who is Rozeno?" Parker asked. 

"He is, or he was once, a Spanish priest. He and Ulnar think they 
rule this island. They are the two 
men we saw watching us from the 
shore. You'll see them in the morning." 

That was the last word Retch 
said on the subject. He took Gotch 
apart, to talk to him. Peg-leg found 
food for Parker, but refused to talk. 
"Na, na, my son, when the Jezbro 
passes over us as a great bird — 
when it goes through the woods at 
night as a great howling beast — we 
do not talk about it." 

Parker pressed for more information, but the old man turned 
stubbornly silent. Later he found 
Parker a place to sleep in his own 
hut. Parker had the impression 
that, all during the night Peg-leg, 
sat on guard at the entrance. 

But nothing came in the night. 
In the morning Retch was there, 
saying, with grim bitterness, that 
now it was time to go up the cliff to 
see Rozeno and Ulnar. Mercedes, 
looking wan and bedraggled, with 



hate in her hot black eyes, was with 
him. So was Gotch. Gotch did not 
look in the least happy. 

"What's biting you?" Parker said 
to Retch. 

"Nothing." 

"I get the impression something 
around here is just about scaring 
the pants off of you." 

"You're crazy!" Retch's voice 
was a snarl. "I'm not afraid of anything around here — you — or anybody else." As he spoke, the man's 
face was a mask and his eyes were 
wild. 

"Sure, okay, I get it," the pilot 
answered. 

They moved along the cliff until 
they came to a ledge that sloped 
upward. 

"We go up here," Gotch grunted. 



AS THEY went upward, they 
rose above the tops of the 
trees. Sparkling thinly in the morning sunlight, the sea came into 
sight. Circling the shoreline at a 
distance of about a mile, a curtain 
of mist was visible. It seemed to 
close in above them too, shielding 
the island like a thin, shining dome. 

"That's a strange fog," Parker 
said. 

"It's not a fog," Retch answered. 
"I don't know exactly what it is, 
but when it is there, the island is 
invisible. If you are on the other 
side of it, you see nothing at all." 

"Urn," Parker said. They continued upward. The ledge twisted, 
curved, went around the rising 
cliff. Slowly Parker became aware 
that the rising ledge was not a natural formation, it was a pathway 
cut into the face of the cliff. 



140 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



At the realization, the pilot felt a 
touch of awe rise in him. This ledge 
was old. It must have been cut into 
this cliff long before Columbus had 
sailed westward. 

Off in the distance beyond the 
curtain of mist was the coast of 
California, the beaches bright with 
bathers, the cities wrapped in warm 
sunshine, the roads alive with traffic. Over there in the distance were 
orange groves and millions of people. 

Here on this island, behind this 
mist, unknown to millions of people so close to it, was something 
that did not belong in the 20th century, or in any other century Parker 
could imagine. 

His back felt cold. In him, somewhere, was gnawing anger. This 
island, this place, was real. Back in 
his past a horrible wrong had been 
done, a wrong that now could never 
be corrected. He put the thought 
out of his mind. 

The ledge turned into the cliff 
and became a tunnel that had been 
carved into solid stone. The walls 
of the tunnel were as smooth as 
polished marble. What tools could 
men have used in the old days to 
cut a tunnel with walls so smooth 
that they looked like glass? Modern 
equipment could not have done the 
job so well. 

Niches in the wall of the tunnel 
admitted light and gave them 
glimpses of the island. 

"Where the hell will we find — 
Oh, Pedro!" Retch spoke. The Indian messenger of the night before 
had appeared in the tunnel. He 
beckoned to them. They followed 
him into a large room cut out of 
solid stone. 



It was one of the cleanest and 
most simply furnished rooms Parker 
had ever seen. It contained handmade chairs along the wall and a 
big table, also hand-made. Light 
from a wall slit flowed into the 
room. 

Seated behind the table, illumined by die light flowing in from 
the wall slit behind them, were 
Rozeno and Ulnar. Rozeno had a 
thin nose, the narrow face of the 
typical high bred Spaniard. Ulnar 
was short and squat, his cheeks 
were flat, his nose hooked. Both had 
black eyes that were utterly fathomless. 

The faces were old, wrinkled, 
and kind. Parker took one look at 
this priest, and instantly liked him. 
As he glanced at Rozeno, saw the 
kindness on that face, he also saw, 
out of the corners of his eyes, Retch 
drawing a' gun. 

In that split second he knew why 
Retch had laughed so violently the 
night before, when Retch had said 
that he would go with them to see 
Rozeno and Ulnar. 

Retch intended to kill both of 
them; to shoot them as they sat 
there at that table, unarmed and 
defenseless; shoot them like dogs! 

The gun was already in Retch's 
hand. Parker's fist went out, up, 
connected with Retch's jaw, a 
blow that had all the pilot's 
strength behind it. 

Retch's head was twisted to one 
side. He reeled away from Parker's 
blow. The snarl that came from his 
lips was the snarl of a wild animal. 
Metal thudded as the gun hit the 
floor. The room echoed with sound 
— Mercedes screaming. Parker followed Retch, followed him as a dog 



SINISTER PARADISE 



141 



follows a rat. He caught a wild 
man. 

Retch stumbled against the wall, 
caught himself on one of the handmade chairs, jerked himself up, and 
drove at Parker. The pilot met the 
charge head on. They went down 
locked together. 

Retch was a tornado erupting 
with violent fury. He threw Parker 
away from him, leaped to his feet. 
Parker pulled himself to one knee. 
The fallen pistol lay' in front of 
him. He snatched it up. 

Retch was coming toward him. 
He saw the gun in Parker's hand, 

TIP Slt3 tPfj 

"I'll kill you/' the pilot said. 



RETCH caught himself. For an 
instant he seemed to hang in 
the air before Parker, yellow glaring in his eyes as he tried to make 
up his mind whether or not to buck 
the gun. 

"Get your hands up," Parker 
said. 

Slowly the yellow went out of 
Retch's eyes. 

' "Get your hands up!" Parker repeated. 

This time Retch obeyed him. 
Parker backed him against the wall, 
took the second pistol from his 
pocket, his own gun. 

"Damn you!" Retch snarled. 
Parker saw that the man was not 
speaking to him but to Gotch, he 
saw also that during all this Gotch 
had not moved. The man stood 
transfixed; afraid to move. 

Parker turned to the two men 
behind the table. They had not 
moved either, though Ulnar looked 
as if he was about to come to his 



feet. Rozeno sat very still. There 
was sadness on his face. 

"Go away," he gestured toward 
Retch. "And you, noo, Gotch, go 
away." 

"You mean we can go after — " 
Gotch faltered. 

"I don't want to see either of you 
again," Rozeno said. There was actual living pain in his voice. "Go!" 

"Wait a minute," Parker spoke 
quickly. 

"Yes, my son?" Rozeno's face 
lost its sadness when he looked at 
Parker, it came alive with sudden 
animation. 

"You don't mean to tell me you 
are going to let these two go?" the 
pilot protested. 

"Of course." 

"But Retch tried to kill you." 

"I know—" 

"And he'll try it again. There's 
something Jiere that's driving him 
crazy. I don't know what it is but 
he knows. If you turn him loose — 
I would just as soon turn loose a 
rattlesnake, Johnny Retch." 

Parker's words were hard, blunt, 
forceful. But for all the effect they 
had on the old priest, he might as 
well not have spoken them. Rozeno 
smiled. "I do not think. Retch or 
Gotch will ever harm us. They have 
no means to harm us." He made a 
gesture with his hands, spoke a single word, "Go!" 

Retch and Gotch went quickly 
from the room, like men who were 
very glad to go. 

"I hope you know' what you are 
doing," Parker said, saw that Rozeno was not looking at him. The 
old priest was watching Mercedes. 

"You may stay here, with us," 
Rozeno added. 



142 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



Mercedes' face mirrored gratitude. "Thank you." 

Rozeno turned his attention to 
Parker. "You are new to our island, 
are you not, my son?" 

"Yes." 

"How did you arrive here? Was 
your ship wrecked?" 

"Yes. Actually, however, we were 
looking for this island." Swiftly 
Parker explained what had happened. 

"Retch went away, he hired you 
to bring him back in a ship that 
flies?" Rozeno seemed a little perturbed. 

For the first time, Ulnar spoke, a 
single grunted sound. Rozeno answered with a swift flow of gutturals that Parker did not understand. Ulnar grunted again, a hot 
light appeared in his eyes. "Kill 
him!" His fist came down upon th,e 
table. ^ § 

Again Rozeno looked pained. "I 
have worked so long and so hard 
with him, trying to show him the 
Way, trying to explain to him that 
killing is not a part of the Way. But 
the old savagery is still in his heart. 
Sometimes I despair of him." He 
shook his head very gently. The 
light flowing in from behind him 
made a halo of his long white hair. 
His eyes searched Parker. They 
were the kindest and at the same 
time the keenest eyes the pilot had 
ever met. They looked at him and 
through him; they probed deep 
down inside of him ; they seemed to 
search down to the bottom of his 
soul. Parker had the feeling he was 
being weighed, measured, probed. 

"It is not often that I offer a 
choice to those who come here," 
Rozeno spoke. "Usually they prefer 



to live in the village at the base of 
the cliff. You may live here with 
us, if you wish." The smile on Rozeno' s face was a living thing. 

Deep down inside of him, Parker 
felt his soul come to sudden life. 
"I'll stay here, Father, if I may." 

The smile on Rozeno' s face became even brighter. "Good, my 
son. You have made a very wise 
choice." 

Parker was silent, perturbed, suddenly uneasy. Here in this place 
two old men lived in rooms near 
the top of a cliff. Down below was 
a village where brawling men lived, 
men who could walk on water. In 
the night, in this place something 
called a Jezbro went on the wings 
of a harp. There was magic here, 
mysteries that went beyond his understanding. What else was here? 

"Tell me about this place, Father?" 

Rozeno nodded. "Gladly, my son, 
gladly. I will show you and tell you 
as I show you. There are things 
here that even I do not understand." For a second, the old priest 
frowned as if he was contemplating 
mysteries that lay afar. Then his 
smile came back and he was rising 
to , his feet. "Come with me, my 



AS THEY moved from the big 
room, Ulnar grunted hastily 
and gestured toward the wall slit. 
Tooking through it, Parker saw a 
speedy craft moving inside the veil 
— a PT boat. His heart jumped at 
the thought that the Navy had 
finally penetrated the secret of this 
strange island. His heart sank when 
he saw that even if this was a PT 



SINISTER PARADISE 



143 



boat, it was not a Navy ship. The 
craft was dirty, unkempt, it was not 
the smart, "spick and span vessel 
that the Navy would operate. 

As he watched, the boat veered 
abruptly, slowed, almost came to a 
halt as if its occupants had suddenly 
discovered the presence of the 
island. 

Ulnar shook his fist at the boat. 
"Vondel me sego!" he said. 

"No, no, Ulnar," Rozeno spoke 
hastily. "You must not vondel 
them. They are just some people 
who have stumbled through the 
veil and now are bewildered." 

"Me make 'em more frightened," 
the Indian spoke. He brought one 
fist down into the other fist, a 
smacking sound. 

"What is vondel?" Parker spoke. 

Rozeno seemed not to hear him. 
The priest was already moving 
from the room. 

"We do not know who cut these 
passages here," Rozeno said. "We 
do not know who cut these rooms 
into the rock. Some race that lived 
a long, long time ago — perhaps the 
legendary Murians, perhaps some 
other race — had this island as an 
outpost. I think, also, they used it 
as a scientific laboratory; a dangerous laboratory that they put far 
away from their homeland. A place 
where their wise men — their philosophers — could seek out the mysteries of nature." 

"Um," Parker said. There was 
cold in him. He tried to force it 
away, discovered it would not go. 

"There is, something else that is 
very strange about this island," the 
priest continued. "Time is different 
here." 

"How is time different?" 



"In this way," Rozeno answered. 
"I came to the New World with 
Cortez." , 

"I see," Parker said. 

"You take it very calmly." 

"I do not doubt my own eyes nor 
do I doubt you." 

The old priest glowed. "Good. 
Good. Tell me, my son, are there 
many men like you in the world of 
today? I have a dream, a secret 
private dream, that the scientists 
from your world might come here 
and study the strange things on this 
island." 

"They would come here in droves 
if they knew about it. And so would 
everybody else. You would be overrun by hordes of the curious." 

"Yes, we know that. That isn't 
quite what I meant. It was my hope 
that perhaps we could make this 
island what it ^as in the olden days 
■ — secret place where the wise men 
could come to study." The priest's 
face glowed again. "There is so 
much here to be learned and here, 
also, is the time in which to learn. 
Here great discoveries might be 
made. Here could possibly be discovered not only the secrets of nature but the secrets of the minds 
and the hearts of men. From this 
place, as the centuries passed, there 
might be fed out, little by little, 
knowledge that would change the 
world; knowledge that would 
change the hearts and the minds of 
men; knowledge that would eliminate poverty, stop wars, knowledge 
that would help the human race become what it must one day be." 

The glow on Rozeno's face was 
bright. The dream he dreamed was 
suddenly, in Parker's mind, a living, breathing vital hope, the hope 



144 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



of all honest men everywhere, that 
tomorrow might be better! 

"Would you, my son, help me 
achieve that dream? Will you go 
back through the veil and explain 
to some of your greatest scientists 
what we have here?" 

"I would like nothing better," 
the big pilot answered. In a way, 
this was his dream too, though up 
until now it had always been a secret, hidden, impossible-to-accomplish thing. His hand went out to 
Rozeno. Deep inside of him, the 
glow grew to greater heights. Only 
one other thing was needed to make 
this glow a really perfect feeling, 
Effra, who had found this island 
and had tried to tell him about it. 
But Effra was gone. 

They moved on to a big room 
where some of the scientific equipment of the vanishe<0ace still functioned. Set in a sunken pool ten feet 
in diameter in the center of the 
room was a circle of what looked 
like mercury. Leading up from it 
were heavy bus bars of some unknown metal. The bus bars came 
together and marched across the 
room to a control panel, one of the 
strangest control panels Parker had 
ever seen. The meters were graduated in colors. In front of the 
chair where the operator sat was 
a keyboard like that of a vast pipe 
organ. How much training would 
an operator need to operate this 
keyboard? Directly in front of the 
operator's seat was a square panel 
that looked like a television screen. 



SET in niches where the right 
hand of the operator could 
reach them easily were statuettes of 



birds, animals, reptiles. Made of 
some metal, they were perfect representations. Parker saw a condor, 
a bald-headed eagle, a humming 
bird, a cougar, a jaguar, an alligator. His eyes went back to the pool 
in the center of the room. 

"It is generating power," Rozeno 
said. "As it turns, it creates some 
force, some energy. I do not understand this energy. No one now 
alive understands it. Understanding is one of the things I hope your 
scientists may achieve — come away, 
Ulnar." The last was spoken as the 
Indian strayed near the operator's 
seat. 

Ulnar grunted impatiently. There 
was something about that seat that 
lured him. But he came away. They 
went into another room, leaving 
behind them the pool of mercury 
that turned slowly, like a miniature 
earth On some axis of its own. 
Parker took one look at the contents 
of this room, and gasped. 

The crown jewels of England 
were no greater than these! Here 
were crowns of pounded yellow 
gold; here Were gargoyle masks 
made of the same yellow metal; 
masks that sparkled with gems. 
Here, lying on the rock shelves, 
were ingots of what looked to be 
solid gold, each one heavy enough 
to be a full load for a grown man. 

Ulnar was examining a -gargoyle 
mask. He touched a gold bar, his 
old withered fingers seeming to 
savor the feel of it. 

Rozeno smiled gently. "Ulnar 
treasures these things, they were 
put in his charge a very long time 
ago. He has been faithful to his 
trust." 

"But — " Parker whispered. 



SINISTER PARADISE 



145 



"This is a part of Montezuma's 
treasure, a part that Cortez did not 
get. There is as much of it here as 
400 men could carry away. Ulnar 
was one of Montezuma's most 
trusted sub-chiefs. He brought the 
treasure here, to keep it for his 
Chieftan." 

Ulnar's wrinkled face broke into 
a grin. "Me take good care," he 
said simply. "Me clean, me polish, 
me save for my Chief." 

"Tell me one thing?" he said. 

"Gladly, my son." 

"Does Johnny Retch know this 
is here?" 

"I suppose so. All who live on 
our island know about it." 

Muscles knotted at the corners 
of Parker's jaws. He pressed his 
arms down against his jacket so 
that he could feel the guns in the 
pockets. The guns felt good. 

"Father Rozeno!" a voice called 
from a corridor outside the treasure 
room. "Father Rozeno? Where are 
you?" 

"Here I am, my dear," the priest 
answered. 

At the sound of that voice, Bill 
Parker forgot all about the guns in 
his pockets, Johnny Retch, Montezuma's treasure, and everything 
else that was on this island. He 
stood stock still, paralyzed. 

A girl came through the opening 
into the treasure room. She wore a 
dark dress; sandals; her hands were 
gloved; she had apparently been 
working at some task. She smiled at 
Ulnar, glanced at Parker, nodded, 
looked at Rozeno, smiled, then 
glanced back quickly at Parker as if 
he reminded her of someone she 
had once known, then turned again 
to the priest. "Father, I have been 



cleaning all morning — " 

So far she got. Bill Parker broke 
his paralysis and swept her into his 
arms. 

"Effra — Effra — Effra — " His 
voice was a choked whisper, almost 
inaudible in the treasure chamber of Montezuma. ' As she had 
come through the door, his mind 
had given him a flashing picture 
of the plane wrecked on the shore. 
Effra, fleeing from Dr. Yammer, 
had taken one last desperate chance 
on finding her island; one last lonely flight out over the Pacific. No 
wonder he had been unable to find 
her. She had found her island. She 
had come here. She was here, in 
his arms. 

There was wonder and awe and 
bewilderment in the big pilot. Here 
was a miracle almost past the understanding. "I've found you — 
Effra—" 

For an instant, she lay in his 
arms like a frightened child who 
dared not move. "Please — " she 
whispered. He did not hear her. His 
lips sought hers, found them. She 
did not draw away, but neither did 
she respond. "Effra — " Parker 
looked up. Rozeno and Ulnar were 
regarding him with mild astonishment. In his arms, Effra stirred 
again. "Please — let me go." 

This time the big pilot heard her. 
Setting her back on her feet was 
one of the hastiest movements he 
had ever made in his life. "Effra — 
I did not mean to startle you — but 
darling — " 

She stood irresolute, staring at 
him. "Please — You have no 
right—" 

He saw that her eyes, fixed on 
him, regarded him as an utter 



146 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



and complete stranger. 

"Don't you know me, Effra?" 
There was almost a sob in his voice. 

"I never saw you before in my 
life." 



PARKER turned, moved to a 
window slot, stood looking 
out. The trees below him, the island, the sea, the PT boat lying at 
anchor off shore, he saw all of these 
things, but yet he did not see them. 

He had found Effra and she did 
not remember him, did not know 
him. Inside of him was agony, such 
pain as he had never known. He 
felt a touch on his arm. Rozeno 
stood there, his face troubled. "Do 
you know our Effra, my son?" 

"Yes." 

"Do you, perhaps, love her?" 

"Yes." 

"And you are very unhappy because she does not respond?" 

"Yes." 

The old priest's face grew a little 
more sad. "When she landed here, 
the last time, she made an awkward 
landing. She was thrown forward 
and she hit her head. She does not 
remember anything that happened 
before that." Rozeno's finger bit 
deeply into Parker's" arm. "Come 
now, and I will introduce you to 
her, as a stranger." 

Bill Parker found himself being 
introduced to the woman he loved. 
"I'm sorry about my actions of a 
minute ago," he said. "I thought 
you were someone else." 

The smile she gave him was forgiving but it was also cool and distant. "That's all right, Mr. Parker. 
I understand." Her voice went 
into silence as another sound came 



into the room. The sound of rapid 
gunfire. 

Parker had thought he had in 
his pocket the only two modern 
weapons on the island, but somewhere in the growth of trees far 
below the window slot, someone 
was firing a sub-machine gun. 

Parker raced to the slot. Below 
him the island lay quiet. He turned. 
Mercedes, her face working, was 
staring at him. 

"Beel — Beel — I have not told 
you everything! That Johnny 
Retch, he hire you to fly him here 
in 'copter, to find thees island. He 
also have men in boat coming. Your 
job, which you did not know, was 
to find island, then lead men in 
boat to it. Johnny means to take 
all thees. The gesture of her hand 
included all the treasure of Montezuma. "He have men in boat to 
help him take it. He does not mean 
to let anything stop him. Not anything!" 

Parker saw what he had not 
seen before, that Johnny Retch 
was a man who would always have 
two strings for his bow. Too late, 
he saw that the boat lying at anchor 
was not an accident. 

"I should have killed that dog 
when I had the chance!" he 
snarled. 

Shambling feet sounded in the 
corridor outside. Pedro burst into 
the room. He grunted words at 
Ulnar. 

"Pedro says men come up the 
ledge," Rozeno said. "They must be 
from the boat. We must go to meet 
them. It will be a great pleasure to 
them. Come, Ulnar. Come, Bill." 
He moved toward the door. 

Parker was across the room in 



SINISTER PARADISE 



147 



quick strides, catching Rozeno's 
arm. "You can't do it, Father Rozeno. Those men who are coming 
up the ledge mean to kill." 

."My son!" Hurt showed on the 
priest's face. "Surely you do not 
know what you are talking about!" 

"But I do know!" Parker almost 
shouted the words. Quickly, desperately he tried to explain the situation to Rozeno. To his growing horror, he saw no comprehension in 
the old priest's eyes. Slowly Parker 
began to realize that this old man 
was so gentle and so kind himself 
that he could not comprehend even 
the thought of anyone else beingevil! 

"You may stay here, if you wish, 
my son, but Ulnar and I will go 
speak to these people who are coming up the ledge. Come, Ulnar." 

His face glowing at the thought 
of meeting new people, the priest 
moved from the room. Ulnar 
grunted once, a hot, savage sound, 
then followed Rozeno like a dog 
following its master. 

Effra started to follow them. 

Parker caught her arm. "Please, 
at least you stay here. Understand 
me now if you never understood 
me before. Is there a window slot 
from which the ledge can be seen?" 

"Yes." 

"Then take me to it. Quickly!" 



FROM the slot, Parker could 
see a section of the ledge. Two 
men were crawling along it, advancing as cautiously as scouts 
trying to surprise an outpost. 
Parker had never seen either of 
them before but their faces confirmed everything Mercedes had 



said — they were thugs, killers. 
Thrusting the pistol through the 
slot, the pilot took careful aim. 
pulled the trigger. 

The thunder of the gun rang 
through the room, echoed across 
the island. The bullet knocked rock 
chips into the face of the lead man. 
He recoiled as if he had been 
stung. The Tommy-gun in his hand 
spouted lead blindly at the face of 
the cliff. The second man spun 
around — began shooting blindly. 

Parker moved away from the slot, 
listened to the rattle of the guns 
outside. He could distinguish the 
heavy thud of the Tommy-gun, the 
sharper crack of the carbine, but 
other weapons were also firing. 
"They've got men with high-powered rifles posted in the tree down 
below." 

He glanced from the slot. The 
men had disappeared from the 
ledge. As he moved back, a slug 
whined into the room. Mercedes 
cowered against the wall. Effra remained cool and poised. She was 
looking at Parker. "Haven't I met 
you somewhere before?" She 
seemed completely unaware r oi the 
rifle bullet that had just screamed 
through the slot. 

"I — " Parker caught himself. 
There was agony in him. What 
good would it do if she did, finally, 
remember who he was, who she 
was? What they had once been to 
each other? He had three old men, 
and two women, and himself, with 
which to defend Montezuma's 
treasure against Johnny Retch, who 
had a small army of trained killers 
at his back. 

What chance did they have? 
Johnny Retch, even if given Mon


148 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



tezuma's gold, would not leave anyone alive except possibly Mercedes 
and Effra. 

"Do — do you know anything we 
can do to stop those men?" Parker 
said. 

Light seemed to come into 
Effra's eyes. 

"We might — we might use the 
Jezbro!" 

From the shelter of the trees, 
Johnny Retch operated like a general in charge of a force of Commandos engaged in attacking a 
miniature Gibralter. He was a very 
deliberate general. When the first 
shot from a slot in the cliff had 
driven the two men downward, he 
met them at the bottom of the 
ledge, a cigarette dangling from his 
lips, a sub-machine gun in his 
hands. "Okay, boys, go back on 
up." 

"There's a guy in there with a 
gun," one of the two protested. 
"He's inside and we're outside. 
We're sittin' ducks for him." 

"We're covering the slots with 
rifles in the trees." 

"But — " Neither of the men 
wanted to go up that ledge again. 
They might be hardened killers but 
they did not like the idea of facing 
a gun they could not see. 

"Go on back up, boys," Retch 
said. He lifted the muzzle t of the 
gun he held. 

"But—" 

"Either go back up or you'll stay 
down here a long time!" 

They went back up the ledge. 
Retch retired to the shelter of the 
trees and watched. 

No shots came until they reached 
the mouth of the tunnel leading 
into the cliff. There, one of the 



men was killed. He fell backward 
from the ledge, screaming as he 
turned over and over. 

The falling man broke his way 
through the top of a tree and 
sprawled thudding on the ground. 
He did not move after he hit. Retch 
did not waste a second glance on 
him. 

Muffled but clearly audible, the 
blasting roar of the machine gun 
came from the tunnel. 

"He got in," Retch said. "Okay. 
Two more of you go up." 

Two more men went up the 
ledge. 

The entire population of the village had gathered to watch this 
storming of the cliff. They regarded 
Retch with wonder and with awe. 
Some of these men had been pirates 
in their day, they had known how 
to loot a tall ship, to kill its crew, 
to take over any wealth and any 
women it happened to carry. 

Watching Retch, they discovered 
they had been amateurs in the fine 
art of attacking and killing. They 
had needed a man. from the modern world to show them how the 
job ought to be done. They were 
greatly impressed, Gotch most of 
kll. 

Waving his sword, Gotch explained what he would do to that 
black priest, Rozeno, and to that 
cowardly Indian, Ulnar. Of all the 
listening group, only Peg-leg protested. 

"Yeah, you'll get them all right 
— if the Jezbro don't get you first!" 
Peg-leg said. 

Retch overheard the words. 
"Come here, Peg-leg, I want to 
talk to you." 

The old sailor stumped his way 



SINISTER PARADISE 



149 



to where Retch stood. 

"Aye, Cap'n." He saluted. A look 
of surprise appeared on the old 
sailor's face as the first heavy slug 
hit him. As the second, third, and 
fourth slugs hit him, the expression 
of surprise became one of agony. He 
fell without a sound". 



RETCH stood looking down at 
him. 

The group was silent. Gotch 
hastily lowered his sword. 

"I don't want to hear any more 
superstitious talk," Retch said. 
"There are a lot of funny things 
here on this island but there is 
nothing to be afraid of — -except 
thisl" He patted the stock of the 
stumpy little gun he held. "And 
there's enough stuff up there to 
make all of us rich; we'll have everything we can ever want." A glow 
crept into Retch's eyes as he spoke. 
They glowed with a yellow color 
and the yellow seemed to come out 
of his eyes and spread over his face. 
He glanced down at Peg-leg. , * 

"Dump him into the sea," he 
said, walking away. 

The two men climbing the ledge 
reached the opening. They stopped 
there and apparently held a conference with the man who was already inside. They went inside. A 
few minutes later, one appeared at 
the opening. 

"You can come on up now," he 
yelled, waving his gun. "All secure 
here." 

"Gotch!" 

"Yes, Cap'n." 

"Come on." 

Gotch went up the ledge with 
Retch. He went in shivering fear 



which he tried desperately to conceal. 

"What the hell are you scared 
of?" Retch snarled at him. 

"Nuthin', nuthin', Cap'n. Nuthin'." 

"You yellow-livered—" Retch 
stopped in midsentence. A sound 
was in the air, the cheeping of a 
sleepy bird. It was a tiny sound, 
fragile, distant, far-away, almost 
too weak to register on the ears. 
Hearing it, Retch jerked his eyes to 
the sky, seeking the source. 

Gotch threw himself flat on the 
ledge. 

"The Jezbro!" Gotch gasped. 
"God— God— " 

Looking at the sky, Retch caught 
a glimpse of something moving 
there. It looked like a bird, but it 
was like no bird he had ever seen 
in his life. It was more like shadow 
— a darkness that had a darting elusive silver color about it. 

Like a swooping hawk, it was 
diving toward the ground, aiming 
at the group clustered in the trees 
at the spot where the ledge began 
to rise up the face of the cliff. As 
it dived, the cheeping sound of a 
sleeping bird was becoming a flooding blast of wild harp notes. 

"The Jezbro!" Gotch wailed. 

The Jezbro dived at the men on 
the ground. They heard it, saw it; 
they scattered through the trees like 
frightened chickens fleeing from a 
hawk. 

The Jezbro selected a victim. 
Retch caught a glimpse of long, 
cruel talons extended ; saw the man 
grasped in them. The man screamed 
as the talons touched him, tried to 
throw himself flat, tried to jerk 
away from them. Huge wings flut


150 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



tered, beating the air. The man did 
not escape. The talons held. The 
beating wings lifted him. 

Wild notes flooded outward. 
There was triumph in the music 
now. Huge wings beat the air. The 
Jezbro climbed up above the trees. 
Held firmly in the extended talons 
was a fully grown man. 

Watching, Johnny Retch felt 
panic tumble through him, panic 
that was like a sudden touch of an 
ice cold hand. They had warned 
him about the Jezbro. Old Peg-leg 
had tried to tell him. Gotch had 
trembled in fear. They had all insisted that there was something 
here that did not belong in the 
world as he knew it. 

He had laughed at them, he had 
called them superstitious fools. To 
him, there was nothing that was 
not of this world. 

Nor was there now, when the 
moment of wild panic had passed. 
As the Jezbro swept upward 
through the air, rising along the 
face of the cliff, Retch jerked up 
the Tommy gun. 

Smoke and lead blasted from 
the muzzle. The Jezbro was unharmed. Taking careful aim this 
time, Retch fired again, a furious 
blast of rattling sound. 

The Jezbro swerved, the harp 
notes missed a beat. 

From the suddenly loosened 
talons a figure plummeted downward, screamed as it fell, stopped 
screaming as it crunched against 
the ground. 

The Jezbro circled in the air. It 
rose upward, swooped. Huge wings 
flapped, a tail structure was extended. From the gaping, extended 
mouth, a scream arose. The Jezbro 



seemed to leap toward the summit 
of the sky. 

A flash of light as brilliant as the 
explosion of a miniature atom 
bomb flared for a brief second. 
Thunder clapped, rolled around 
the horizon; echoed back. In the 
distance the veil that circled the 
island shimmered and twisted as if 
it was about to collapse. It righted 
itself. 

Except for a puff of swiftly dissipating white vapor, the air was 
clear. Where wild harp notes had 
once flooded now was silence. 
Where a creature that had once 
looked like a giant bird had flapped 
through the air now there was 
nothing. 



ON THE ledge, Johnny Retch 
wiped sweat from his face. 
From his pockets, he methodically 
refilled the almost empty clip of the 
gun. He looked down at Gotch, 
who was sitting up. 

"You killed the Jezbro!" Gotch 
was whispering. His eyes were 
searching the sky as if he still did 
not believe what he had seen happen. 

"Sure," Retch answered. "I don't 
know what the hell it was, but it 
could be killed. Anything can be 
killed, Gotch. Remember that." 
The sting of acid crept into his 
voice. "Get up. We're going on up 
the ledge." 

"By God, Johnny, you can do 
anything!" Gotch spoke. He rose 
with suddenly renewed confidence. 
"Wait'li we get to them — " He 
looked up the ledge toward the 
mouth of the tunnel. 

Effra was seated in the operator's 



SINISTER PARADISE 



151 



chair in front of the complex control panel that resembled the key 
board of a strange organ. She had 
been watching an image move in 
the screen directly in front of her 
eyes. 

This image — it had been that of 
a great bird — had suddenly vanished. 

"The Jezbro was destroyed!" she 
whispered. "The core of it was 
struck. When that happens, the 
complete projection is torn to 
pieces!" Her face was white with 
strain. 

Parker took his eyes off the 
screen where he had been watching 
something that he did not pretend 
to understand. 

"Sometimes they are very difficult to control,"- Effra continued, 
her voice a whisper. "Once set in 
motion, they seem almost to achieve 
life of their own. I did not send the 
Jezbro against the men on the 
ground, I sent it against the man 
on the ledge, against this Retch. 
But — " her voice faltered. 

"I saw it get away," Parker said. 
There was turmoil in his mind, confusion. He was in a place where 
miracles came to life. The secret of 
the ability to walk on the water lay 
here in this room. Effra, in swift 
sentences had explained to him that 
the men who walked on the water 
carried little pieces of metal in their 
pockets; pieces of metal which increased tremendously the surface 
tension of the water where they 
stepped on it. She had also told him 
that Ulnar, working this equipment, had vondeled his helicopter, 
had sent out a tiny Jezbro that had 
struck at the ship, wrecking it. The 
Jezbro, the secret of the men walk


ing on the water, had come from 
this room. The striking of the Jezbro was to Ulnar the act of vondel. 
Even the veil that surrounded the 
island was generated here; in the 
power being generated in the slowly circling pool of mercury; power 
that was changed and modified by 
the other equipment. 

Here was the heart and the secret of the magic of this island; 
here even time was set aside. 

Ulnar poked at Effra, grunted 
harshly. "I know," the girl said 
quickly. "In just a minute." 

Ulnar grunted again. He hovered 
over her like some massive brooding spirit. He was eager to get his 
hands on the control board but his 
old fingers were no longer sufficiently flexible to play on that key 
board the tune that had to be 
played. 

"Pater noster—^-Our Father- — " 
In the silence came Rozeno's voice 
as he knelt in prayer. Bewildered 
and hurt and horrified, Rozeno 
and Ulnar had come back into the 
room to find Parker and Effra and 
Mercedes already there. Mercedes 
knelt beside him. 

Pedro thrust his head through 
the opening behind them. "Him 
two more men, him man that kill 
Jezbro, him still coming up ledge." 

"That's Johnny Retch," Parker 
said. "He's still coming. And there 
are probably others already inside 
here, looking for us in the rooms 
and corridors. We've got to move, 
Effra." 

"I know^ Bill." Her fingers started toward the control board, drew 
back. "I called you Bill. Is that your 
name?" 

"Yes." 



152 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



"It's a nice name." 

"But now we must hurry," Parker said. As he spoke, Ulnar grunted 
a single sound that set the girl into 
motion. 

Her fingers went to one of the 
little statuettes, an eagle, a perfect 
thing in its way, a marvelous representation of the bird of prey. Effra 
had told Parker, in hasty sentences, 
how these images were made, deep 
down in the mountain, of a particular kind of metal that was almost weightless. He watched her 
slip the eagle into a slot, held his 
breath as her fingers darted across 
the key board. 

A soft hum sounded — currents 
moving — a glow sprang into existence surrounding the little image. 
Slowly, the statuette began to glow 
with a silver light. The glow played 
over it, it shifted, changed, was one 
thing this instant, was something 
else the next instant. It looked like 
a moth emerging from a cocoon 
and becoming a butterfly. The tiny 
wings came free, the head moved. 

The cheeping of a sleepy bird 
was in the room. 

At the sound, a wave of cold 
from the deepest depths of space 
seemed to sweep over Parker. Here 
was magic beyond the comprehension of the mind. Only it wasn't 
magic, it was a scientific achievement of the highest caliber. 



AT THE cheeping- sound, 
Effra's fingers moved swiftly 
on the control board, playing a symphony that only she understood. 
The little eagle moved out of the 
slot, it spread its wings, they fluttered, it moved upward into the 



air of the room. 

With each circling of the room, 
it grew larger. The cheeping sound 
became louder, there was a touch 
of harp music in it now. Effra's 
fingers moved like lightning over 
the control panel. The growing 
eagle seemed to pick up its controls, 
it swirled, circled, went through 
the open slot, went out of the room, 
and into the air outside. It was now 
the Jezbro. 

Its image appeared on the 
screen. It shot high into the air, 
still growing. The scene on the 
screen revealed in miniature the 
whole island, the sea lapping its 
shores, the boat lying at anchor. 
Effra's fingers moved frantically 
over the controls. "This is one of 
-the hardest things to do. They seem 
to be attracted to the,, sun, when 
first released. They struggle desperately to escape into space — There! 
I've got it under control." 

The scene changed, became a 
group of men climbing the ledge. 
Parker saw these men suddenly jerk 
their heads toward the sky as they 
l»ecame aware of the Jezbro. He 
could imagine the fear that was 
shooting through them. They had 
seen Johnny Retch destroy the 
Jezbro, only here the Jezbro was 
again. 

From their viewpoint, it had miraculously come back to life and 
was diving again upon them from 
the sky. Guns were fired upward. 
But these men did not have the 
cool, hard nerves of Johnny Retch, 
did not have his shooting eye. They 
missed. The Jezbro dived among 
them. 

They scattered, screaming. Two 
went off the ledge, three raced 



SINISTER PARADISE 



153 



down it. One mounted to the sky 
to the triumphant harping of the 
Jezbro. 

Parker felt a wave of relief flow 
through him. Here in the Jezbro 
was actually a most potent weapon, 
the means of stopping an attack. 
"Girl! You've done it!" 

A second later he caught himself. 
"But Johnny Retch wasn't in that 
bunch. He must already be inside 
the cliff." 

A gun roared three times inside 
the mountain. Footsteps faltered in 
the corridor outside. Pedro stumbled into the room. His face was a 
bloody mask. 

"Him men inside." As he 
coughed out the words, he coughed 
out blood — and his life. He stumbled, caught himself, stumbled 
again, went down the way a dead 
man goes down, never to rise again. 

"Qui est in Coelis — who are in 
Heaven — -" Rozeno's voice whispered through the room. The only 
sound. 

Ulnar moved slowly, stood beside 
Pedro. They had been master and 
servant but in the old days they had 
come up out of Mexico together, 
guarding a treasure. Ulnar moved 
to the wall, took down a heayy 
battle axe that hung there. "Time 
come for me," he said. "Me go meet 
men as my chief went to meet Cortez!" His eyes glinted. 

"Wait!" Rozeno called. The 
priest was on his feet. "I have resolved the conflict in my soul. There 
comes a time when men, even good 
men, must fight against the forces 
of evil." From the wall he took a 
spear. 

"I'll go with you two," Parker 
said. "In just a moment." From his 



jacket, he took one of the two pistols. Silently he passed it to Effra. 
"As a last resort, use it." 

"But, Bill, there is still time — " 

Parker didn't hear her. He was 
moving with Rozeno and Ulnar 
through another opening. "At 
least," Rozeno was saying. "We 
have this advantage. We know our 
way around here." 

They moved silently, by side passages, through the rooms. "Find 
Retch," Parker whispered over and 
over again. "He's the heart and the 
core of this business. With him out 
of the way, we can handle the 
others." 

"Do you see anybody, Pfluger?" 
Retch's voice came from somewhere. 

"Naw. I think I got the old gink 
but he ducked out of sight somewhere." 

"Retch is on the other side of 
the corridor," Rozeno whispered. 
"The man who spoke last is in the 
next room." 

They slipped to the opening, 
peering into the next room. A man 
in there was crouching against the 
wall and watching the opening into 
the corridor. At the sight of the 
man, Ulnar went berserk. This was 
the man who had killed Pedro. 

A shrill battle cry pealing from 
his lips, massive axe uplifted, Ulnar 
charged through the door. 

The crouching man whirled. 
Smoke and thunder rolled from the 
gun in his hand. Ulnar had taken 
death wounds before he was halfway across the room. But death 
wounds or not, he kept going. 

The heavy axe came down on the 
head of the man who was desperately trying to fend it off. The man 



154 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



went down. For an instant, Ulnar's 
battle cry of triumph, wild and savage and fierce, roared through the 
honeycomb of passages, then went 
into silence with Ulnar, forever. 

"Hey, Pfluger, what the hell happened?" Retch's startled voice 
came. 

"We've got to cross the corridor 
to get at him," Parker whispered. 
"And there are other men in here 
somewhere." 

"Listen!" Rozeno whispered. 

Voices, a babble of sound, were 
coming from behind them. 

"The men from the village," Rozeno whispered. "When they ceased 
fearing the Jezbro, they found the 
courage to come up here." 



THE BABBLE grew stronger. 
Running feet moved along the 
corridor. Retch shouted somewhere, 
but the words were lost. 

Rising above the other sounds 
was the cry of a woman— Effra. 

Parker cursed beneath his breath 
as he ran. At the side entrance to 
the big room where the pool of mercury turned, he stopped, appalled. 

The room seemed full of men. 
Some of them he recognized as 
coming from the village, others he 
had never seen before. From their 
appearance he judged they had 
come in the boat. Retch was coming through the door, that led into 
the main corridor. The gun in his 
hands was centered on Effra, who 
crouched at the key board of the 
vast machine. There was a smile on 
Retch's face. 

"Parker!" Retch's voice lifted in 
a yell. "Parker! I've got your girl. 
Come on out and give yourself up 



or I'll let her have it." 

This was his moment of triumph, 
this was the moment when he won 
his victory. Parker, peering around 
the edge of the doorway, knew now 
that he had no way to go. If he 
moved into the room, and tried to 
shoot Retch, the man would certainly kill Effra in one wild burst of 
slugs as he turned the gun on the 
pilot. 

"Parker!" Retch yelled again. A 
smile on his face, he waited for an 
answer. 

EfTra's fingers moved on the control panel. Mercedes got slowly to 
her feet. The men in the room were 
silent, waiting for an answer to 
Retch's Command. Parker stood 
just outside the door, hesitant. No 
matter what he did, it seemed to 
him that there was only one answer. 

Behind Retch, coming from the 
corridor, something moved. At the 
sight of it, Parker felt a flood of biting cold surge through him. 

It was a puma— a gigantic puma. 
In its jaws, as it swung its head 
from side to side, dangled the body 
of a man it had killed in the corridor. 

It was a Jezbro puma. 
• Once it had been a little image 
in a niche beside the machine from 
the old time. Then life had flowed 
into it, its own kind of life, now it 
walked as a huge ravening beast 
through the room where once it had 
been a tiny image. 

The first man who saw it went 
dead white and slumped downward 
in a faint. The others saw it in almost the same instant. Pandemonium swept through the room. 
No man's nerves were proof against 
such a sight as this. Screaming mer 



SINISTER PARADISE 



155 



were suddenly trying to fight their 
way out of a place that had suddenly become haunted. 

The puma flowed into the room. 
Like Retch, it had yellow eyes. They 
glared now, with a burning light. 
There was a vague mistiness about 
this puma but there was also about 
it the appearance of solid reality. 

Retch spun to face the menace 
coming from behind him. The gun 
in his hands spat flame and fury. 

He had destroyed the Jezbro 
hawk. He would also destroy this 
Jezbro puma. 

The puma dropped the man 
from its jaws. It crouched. It leaped 
straight at the gun spouting lead. 
Retch slid to one side. The puma 
missed. It hit the floor, slid, tried to 
turn as a frantic girl moved buttons 
on the key board. 

The floor was slick, the padded 
feet did not grip. The tail of the 
sliding puma touched the pool of 
mercury. The tail smoked as if it 
was suddenly on "fire. 

The puma screamed. It seemed 
to be drawn into the pool. It was as 
if something in the pool caught the 
puma, held it, pulled it into the 
mercury. 

It went out of sight, vanished. 
No puff of flame followed. The life 
that had animated it had come 
from this pool. Now the life had returned to its source. 

The dazed Retch lowered his 
smoking gun. 

Parker moved silently forward. 

"Lay down the gun, Johnny 
Retch!" he said. 

Retch seemed to stiffen. His back 
was to Parker. He did not attempt 
to turn. 

"You called for me/' Parker said. 



"Here I am. Drop the gun!" 

Retch snarled, spun, dropping 
flat as he turned. His eyes were narrowed. They glared at Parker like 
twin flames of yellow hate. He tried 
to bring up the gun. 

Something came through the air, 
something that he did not see. It 
grabbed his arms, clutched them 
with a fierce grip, screamed at him. 
Mercedes! 

Retch, with one savage thrust, 
flung her aside. Again the two yellow eyes glared at Parker as Retch 
brought up the weapon that he 
held. 

"You haven^t licked me yet!" 
Retch screamed? 

The gun in Parker's hand exploded. 

Suddenly Retch had three eyes. 
One of them was in the middle of 
his forehead. It was round and 
blue. 

He stood for a second, transfixed. 
Something had happened to him. 
He did not know exactly what it 
was. He had come here seeking 
Montezuma's treasure. He had it 
in the reach of his hand. But some*thing had happened to him. What 
it was he did not quite know. Something — 

He tried to lift the gun he held. 
His hands would not obey him. Or 
perhaps the gun had suddenly 
grown too heavy for him to lift. He 
could not raise it. 

The yellow light in his eyes did 
not change. But suddenly he collapsed, went down, did not move. 



EVEN after he was on the floor, 
his eyes remained fixed on Parker, glaring, yellow. Then, little by 



156 



ROBERT MOORE WILLIAMS 



little, the yellow flames began to go 
out. 

In the silence were two sounds. 
The first, Mercedes, whispering. 
'"Ave I paid my debt, Beel? I 
tried." 

"You have paid it," Parker said. 

The other sound was that of the 
old priest beginning the prayers for 
the dying. He had laid aside his 
spear. Now he was kneeling again, 
his voice lifting as he prayed even 
for those who had mis-used him. 

Then there was another sound, 
voices shouting in the distance. The 
men who had run from this room 
were trying to regain their courage, 
trying to find the will to come back 
again. 

Parker moved to the girl who sat 
at the key board. 

"Effra, my dear, if you would — " 

Catching his idea, she nodded. 
Her fingers lifted the image of an 
alligator from its niche. 

Parker saw the 'gator waddle 
from this room of mystery and of 
magic, from . this room of lost 
science, from this forgotten laboratory of a vanished race. 

After the alligator, went a jungle 
fat, full of spit and scratch and the 
sounds of fury. After the cat went a 
jaguar, black, fanged, also with 
yellow eyes. 

In the corridors the screaming 
stopped. Parker, listening, shuddered. He was glad he was not out 
in one of those corridors; one of 
the men who had tried to steal the 
treasure of Montezuma, one of the 
men who had followed Johnny 
Retch. Hell was walking through 



those tunnels — hell in the form of 
an alligator; hell in the form of a 
jungle cat; hell in the form of a 
jaguar with yellow eyes. 

From the window slot, Parker 
watched men swarm out of the 
cliff. Some found the small boats, 
pushed out in them to the PT boat. 
Others swam. A jaguar went along 
the shoreline screeching at them. A 
jungle cat spat at them from the 
edge of the water. 

On the boat, the anchors were 
hastily cast off. Powerful motors 
growled. Gathering speed, leaving 
a growing wake behind it, the boat 
drove itself into the veil, went out 
of sight. 

Parker went back to the girl at 
the key board. 

Her eyes came up to him. "Hello, 
Bill," she said. 

"Effra?" he whispered. 

"As I was sitting here, I remembered who you were — and who I 
am — Bill — Bill — " She came into 
his arms. 

Hours later, on a balcony in 
front of one of the window slots, 
they still stood very close together. 
Rozeno and Mercedes were with 
them. Rozeno was speaking. 

"Do you think, my son, that you 
can go out into the world, and contact, the great men of this time, and 
bring them here one by one, so that 
we may build in this secure spot a 
group from which the lines of progress can flow out to all men in all 
the corners of the earth?" 

"I can, Father," Parker answered, 

"Unto all men — ". Rozeno's lips 
moved in prayer. "Unto all men — '

OUR FAVORITE TOO • 

Ed: 

Let me congratulate you on the 
selection and publication of Charles 
DeVet's Infinity's Child. Once every so often, science fiction turns 
up a tale of this excellence which 
gives the fans something to rave 
about. I hope we will continue to 
hear from Mr. DeVet who had the 
freshest slant on things I've ever 
had the pleasure to read.

FROM THE SCIENCE MAN 

Paul: 

This is just a note commenting 
on the second issue of IF. I liked 
Resurrection Seven, but for the 
most part, the remaining stories 
left me cold. I imagine you get 
plenty of favorable response, however. What really got me was the 
piece on Raymond. It was the fairest, most honest and genuinely objective piece of criticism or reportage I've ever seen in any s-f mag. 
You didn't natter or cajole, or rip 

1 



bitingly. You told the Palmer saga 
with plenty of emphasis on the intriguing Shaver thing as ^t should 
have been told. Damned good! 

My criticisms of the stories perhaps isn't fair, because I'm speaking 
somewhat as 6. jaded roue who has 
seen too much s-f. I'm too hipped 
on Heinlein and Clark I guess, to 
really enjoy any others from the s-f 
line. You're doing all right. Incidentally, whoever prints your mag 
does a bang-up make-up job.

Henry Bott is also. Charles Recour ivho does that short, very interesting science stuff. 



A TOUGH GUY TO GRAB 

Ed: 

. . . In my opinion, your first issue 
topped your second. How, about 
grabbing another Browne story (if 
possible).

$3.50— TWELVE ISSUES 

Dear Sir: 

Just finished the second issue of 
IF. I thought the first one was a 
world-beater, but I can honestly 
say that issue #2 was the best single 
issue of science fiction I've ever 
read and I grab them all the minute they hit the stands. Due to the 

57

THE POSTMAN COMETH 



spotty performance of most of the 
others I've never felt assured about 
a magazine to send in a subscription. But if your next issile of IF 
comes even close to the first two, 
brother you'll have my subscription 
in the next mail — and that's a 
promise. 

. . . Incidentally, I hope you have 
guts enough to keep the magazine 
free of the so-called active fan 
nonsense. I buy and read magazines 
for the stories in them, and any 
space given to other garbage is 
paid for by my money too.

Mr. Robertson! What you said! 



PAGING A PLAYWRIGHT 

Dear Mr. Sturgeon: 

My wife and I have just read 
your short story, Never Underestimate in this month's issue of IF 
magazine. 

May I be so bold as to suggest 
you put this delightful and amusing 
tale into play form? Although we 
are not connected professionally 
with the theater, we feel sure that 
your charming plot and snappy dialogue would be enthusiastically received on the boards. 

Thank you very much for the 
pleasant moments supplied by your 
story that is both provocative and 
amusing.

A STATEMENT OF POLICY 

Dear Ed: 

On the basis of your first two issues, I think we can rate IF among 
the top stf mags. As for the story 
ratings: 

1. It Takes a Thief 

2. Infinity's Child 

3. Jungle in the Sky 

4. The Revealing Pattern 

5. Dreamer's World 

6. Resurrection Seven 

7. The Beast 

8. Welcome Martians 

Your cover, I thought, was the 
mag's worst point. Seems to me I've 
seen it before a hundred times. 
How about a quasi-modern art 
cover? At least it would be different. 

A couple of the institutions of 
secondary education in this fair 
city, namely Central and North 
High, have organized fan clubs. 
The former has twelve members, 
including me, and the latter twenty-four. 

By the way, why not publish a 
list of national science fiction clubs 
and requirements for membership? 
— Jerry Watkins 
2561 Jones St. 
Omaha, Neb. 

As a matter of policy, Jerry, we 
are not going to publicize fan clubs. 
Therefore, the item that a couple 
of institutions of secondary education in your fair city, namely Central and North High, have organized fan clubs, the former having 
twelve members including you, and 
the latter twenty-two, cannot appear in these columns. So solly.

TWO GRIPES 

Dear Sir : 

I've just finished the May issue 
of IF. Liked it very much. I won't 
make any attempt to rate the stories 
because what I like sometimes I 
dislike at another time. 

I do have a gripe, two in fact. 
Why must experience be the deciding factor so much? In your editorial you say, pardon me, in answer 
to a letter, that writers stay on top 
because they're good. I say they 
stay on top because they have been 
good. Just as long as it takes for a 
few stinkers to force the editors to 
take drastic action. It appears very 
much as if a writer's reputation 
counts all too highly when it comes 
to buying his stories. I depend on 
the editor of my favorite magazines 
to choose good stories and if he 
starts failing I'll quit buying. 

My other gripe concerns the topic 
and twist the author gives the 
stories. Let one have the hero fail 
and there's a dearth of heroes failing. Every outstanding story has a 
host of copy cats hoping to cash in 
on the new twist. Every new theme 
gets worked to death. 

But don't take my gripes too 
seriously. You can put in a stinker 
once in a while and I won't give up 
entirely. I might miss an issue or 
two but hope will rise up and I'll 
try again. I'm only trying to keep 
you on your toes. DON'T DEPEND 
ON YOUR REPUTATION. I 
think that accounts for more failures than any other cause. 

— Delbert C. Boecher 
Port Byron, 111. 



—AND IMPROVEMENT 

Dear Editor: 

Your second issue has just 
finished completely amazing meat the great deal of improvement 
IF has undergone in the short space 
of a month or two. 

The"Jungle in the Sky" by Lesser was well written but could of 
had a better plot. Your short stories 
were of such good quality that I 
wish all mags would follow suit. 
The best was "Resurrection Seven", 
But the best story of the issue was 
"Infinity's Child" by Charles V. 
DeVct. 

I don't see what was so great 
about your cover. It just didn't jell 
with me. That hairy arm holding 
hands with the hero while he quite 
deftly shoots his pistol (?) at the 
little green men. I'll take a Bronstell 
any day. 

— Robert Kessler 

North Hollywood, Calif. 

Let us know what you think about 
the cover on the next (November) 
issue. U'< 're trying to get the best — 
nothiru :ess. 



LOVEIIKS, GHOULS AND 
FIRST ISSUES 
Dear Sirs: 

I have just finished reading your 
May issue of IF. It is great. Not 
many science fiction magazines 
come up to your quality. Most of 
them usually show a frontpiece 
of a well-proportioned lovely in 
the arms of a three-headed ghoul, 
who is about to be killed by a 



160 



THE POSTMAN COMETH 



"Super-Hypo-Sonic Galaxy Blaster" held by the hero. 

Again, let me say that this 
magazine is great; keep the good 
stories coming. 

By the way, I missed your first 
issue of IF (March) and would 
like to have it. Enclosed please 
find 3,5c for it. Thank you. 
— Paul Minches 
Los Angeles, Calif. 

Sorry, Paul, that we had to return 
your 35c, along with that of many 
others, because we had no available 
copies of the first (March) issue at 
the time you wrote. However, since 
then we have managed to obtain a 
limited supply and if you still want 
it, shoot us the 35c again. 



NO FANTASY AND 
CHOCK FULL 

Dear Editor : 

For two years I've been an avid 
science fiction fan .... Over this 
time I have acquired two pet hates: 
SF mags, which have around 2/3 
fantasy (which I can't stand) and 
35c mags that give you nothing for 
your money. IF answers both of 
these. No fantasy and a mag chockfull of stories. When I saw your 
first issue with 6 shorts, a novelette and a full length novel I said 
to myself "I don't care how bad it 
is with so much in it I have to 
have it." I was really surprised 
when I didn't find a bad ^tory in it. 
I raced to get your next issue. By 
the way, would you please tell Janet 



Steiner those old hacks (sarcastic) 
like Palmer, Lesser, Shaver, Sturgeon, and Phillips satisfy most of us 
just fine. 

— Hal Shane 

Lawrence, New York

WE HOPE OUR 
EGGS ARE, TOO! 

Dear Mr. Fairman: 

Congrats on a good new mag; 
your May "ish" compared favorably with any of the other digestsize mags in the SF field. I waited 
until now to write, so as to see your 
second "ish"; you can't really tell 
the merits of a mag by its first issue. 
I can now say, and that truly, that 
you have a 'zinc worth reading; but 
first, a few gripes. (1) How about 
some better cover artists? also 
interiors. (2) Drop the Science 
briefs and put in more letters. There 
are too many of those little hunks 
of science going the rounds in stf 
today. 

"Twelve Times Zero" was very 
good, but the shorts were all better. 
Ditto in the May "ish". Improve 
your novels. Personalities in SF I 
like — let's have more of it. Guest 
editorial ... Keep it up in future 
issues . . . Incidentally, thanks for 
your startling expose of Palmer in 
May "ish"; our Palmer For President club greatly appreciated it . . . 
So may Krishna bless you and may 
all Thy eggs be fertile.
