EDUCATION OF A MARTIAN By JOSEPH SHALLIT 




WALTER HARLEY 
glowered across the 
room at his daughter. 
He didn't like the willful tone 
that crept into her voice these 
days; he didn't like the way her 
gray eyes spread wide at him, 
the way her lips tensed, the way 
she drew herself up, tall and slim, 
an arch of determination. The 



darned girl had grown up too 
fast, that was the trouble. 

Joyce faced up to his scowl, 
shaky as she was. She knew what 
he was thinking, because he had 
told her enough times — she was 
a headstrong girl without a brain 
cell to her name; her college education had been a waste; worse 
than that, it had pumped her

a? 



full of crazy ideas, had knocked 
her sense of values upside down. 

"How anybody in their right 
mind ..." he growled at her. 
"Listen, you've already been to 
Mars. You've seen it. What do 
you want to go to that miserable, 
dried-up hole again for?" 

"Because . . . because I was 
happy there," she said tremulously. 

"What? With those miserable 
savages?" He slapped his euphoria pipe down on the table. 
"Ethel, will you listen to that?" 

Joyce's mother, plump and 
round-shouldered and vaguet yed, was deep in her reclining 
chair, the miniature trans viewer 
on her lap, watching a garden 
party in Rome. 

"What is it, dear?" she asked 
unhappily. 

"This crazy girl wants to take 
her vacation on Mars again." 

"Well ... it is educational," 
Ethel said. 

Harley made a wild, exasperated sound. "What do you know 
about it? You've never been there. 
It's a dried-up hole, I tell you. 
It's a slum — it's one great big 
slum. Just one decent hotel in 
the whole place, and that's only 
because some of our boys went 
out there and put it up for them." 

"That awful hotel — " Joyce 
caught herself. Not an argument 
about this, please! There was 
trouble enough waiting for her. 



"I wouldn't stay at the hotel," 
she said quietly. 

"What do you mean? Where 
would you stay?" 

"With some people I know 
there." 

She saw his heavy eyebrows 
clench, saw his eyes search her 
suspiciously. She heard her mother's uneasy movements. She sat 
tautly, her hands in her lap. 

"Who," Harley said finally, 
"are these people?" 

"Just . . . some friends," Joyce 
said. Now it was coming, now, 
now. 

"What friends?" H*r father's 
voice was lower, harsher. 

"Just some people I met when 
I was there last time." 

"Just some .... Say! Is this 
why we've been running up these 
solarphone bills? What've you 
been doing — talking to these people every week?" 

"Only a few times." 

"Look here. Look at me. Joyce, 
answer me. Have you been talking to that fellow you told us 
about — the one you met on your 
other trip?" 

She let it out, a tiny, miserable, "Yes." 

Harley's hand slammed down 
on the table. He wrestled his 
heavy body up out of his chair, 
stamped halfway across the room 
toward her and stopped. 

"Young lady, I'm not going to 
have this. I'm not going to have 




 



anything like this! You hear? 
You want to get tangled up with 
him? My God, you've been communicating with him for a year?" 

"Whenever I was able to," 
Joyce said hoarsely, looking at 
the floor. 

"Joyce!" He came to her, 
reached down and lifted her chin. 
"Joyce, you're not — you're not in 
love with this — this creature!" 

She nodded, suddenly angered 
at her weakness, angered at the 
wetness in her eyes. 

"Oh, my God!" Harley raised 
his arms, brought them down 
with a slap against his thighs. 
He turned away from her. He 
glared at his wife, who was drifting nervously up out of her chair. 
He turned back to Joyce. "You're 
not serious. You can't be. This 
can't — this just can't happen to 
us. You'll have to get this foolishness out of your head right 
now. Right this minute. My God, 
the next thing you know, you'll 
be wanting to marry one of those 
things." 

"I do ... " The sound barely 
came out. She swallowed, forced 
her voice up. "I am going to 
marry him." 

A BLAST of silence swept the 
room, but, strangely, the 
shock of it didn't touch her. All 
at once, she was calm, quiet. She 
had said it, and now she was 
armored against everything. 



"No," her father was saying 
dully. "No, Joyce. No." 

"I'm sorry. Dad," she said all 
in a rush. "I've thought about it 
a long time. I thought I'd forget 
him after a little while. I wasn't 
able to. I'm in love with him — 
I'll always be in love with him. 
When I come back, I'm bringing 
him with me. We're going to be 
married here." 

Now, finally, the storm bi okr 
out of him. He yelled at her, he 
stamped around, his fists pounded the air — it was just as she had 
pictured it, dreaded it. Yet she 
was 'unshaken now, detachedly 
able to watch him as if he were 
some unruly, unintelligent child. 
I am going to marry him, she 
had said, and once the words 
were out, everything else was 
easy. There were no problems. 
There was nothing to be afraid 
of. 

"His name is Gregrill," she said. 
"They don't haw last names. 
We'll have to make one up or 
perhaps use mine." 

"I'll see my daughter deacl before I let her marry a Martian!" 
Harley roared. 

"But if she really loves him — ? 
Ethel intruded timorously. 

"Loves him? Love that miserable scum?" 

"Dad, please," Joyce said quietly. "You're condemning somebody you've never seen." 

"I don't have to see him! He's

a Martian, isn't he? He has horns, 
doesn't he?" 

"They're not horns. They're 
antennae." 

"Call them what you like, 
they're horns!" 

"They're antennae, Dad," 
Joyce repeated firmly. "They're 
proof of advanced development. 
They can communicate with each 
other hundreds of miles. They 
can sense instantly — " 

"I don't want to hear about it!" 

"But, dear," Ethel tried again, 
"sometimes, when they marry an 
Earthling girl, they cut those 
horns off, and then they look 
just tike us." 

"I wouldn't let him — " Joyce 
bit off each word — "do any such 
thing. I'd be utterly ashamed of 
him. I wouldn't marry him if 
he knuckled under to our prejudices like that. What does he 
have to be apologetic about? He's 
a superior being — " 

"Superior?" her father howled 
at her, but his voice was losing 
its power. 

"IN spite of our buildings and 
machines and things, they're 
far richer than we are, really. 
They have such a richness of 
feeling, such warmth, such sensitivity. They understand and feet 
so much more than we do. It's 
— it's fantastic. It's just something we can't comprehend." 
"I see," he said bitterly. "And 



how are you going to comprehend 

them?" 

"Gregiill can speak Earthling 
as well as I can." Joyce said. 
"He's a graduate of the university 
there in Memnonia. Maybe, with 
his guidance, I'll eventually get 
some insight into — " 

"My God," Harley said dully. 
He walked unsteadily away from 
her and fell into his chair. "A 
daughter of mine ..." He looked 
at her again. "Joyce, can't you 
see it's impossible? It couldn't 
work. These mixed marriages 
have never worked out. Never! 
Don't you see how it would be? 
You'd be an outcast. None of 
your friends would ever want to 
see you again." 

"Well, if they should happen 
to be stupid and prejudiced — " 

"I'm that stupid and prejudiced! I wouldn't let a Martian in 
my house! They're the scum of 
the Solar System!" 

"Dad, I won't listen to you 
talk like that." 

"What do you want to do— 
be the wife of a janitor?" he 
went on relentlessly. "Porters and 
janitors, that's all they're fit for." 

"If they were ever given a 
chance — " 

"A chance? What would they 
do with it? Loaf around dreamily, 
get nowhere. Nowhere at all! And 
pull us down to their level while 
they're fouling up our civilization!"

Joyce stood up, her hands 

trembling. 

"You're not going to Mars!" 
Harley shouted. "You're not going, you hear? You're staying 
right here on earth!" ■ 

"I'm afraid," she said unsteadily, "that you're too late. I already have my ticket. I expected 
you'd make a fuss. My — my 
trunk is at the spaceport. Nothing 
can stop mc now, Dad." 

"I'll stop you. You'll never 
marry that scum. By God, if I 
have to take it to the Panterrestrial Court — " 

"Good-by, Dad. I'm not booked to sail till Thursday, but I 
think it's better if I spend the 
remaining days in a hotel. It'll 
be more comfortable for all of 
us." 

"Joyce, come back here!" 

"Good-by, Dad." She waved a 
shaky hand at her mother. 
"Good-by, Mom. See you soon." 

"Joyce! Come back!" 

She went out, quietly closing 
the door behind her. 

rpHE huge 1 200-passenger 
-■■ spaceship settled down slowly 
toward the landing field, its braking jets making a queer whistling 
sound in the thin Martian air. 
The passengers crowded to the 
windows. Most of them were already in their thermosuits, 
though the daylight temperature 
was close to fifty degrees. Some 



were even adjusting their oxygen 
packs. These weren't necessary at 
all, except for long hikes or intense exertion, which few of the 
visitors would indulge in. But 
they'd bought the things and they 
were going to use them — it was 
part of the adventure. 

Most of the passengers were 
working people on vacation, taking advantage of the special twoin-a-room rate. There were a few 
salesmen, nervous but hopeful 
about the possibilities of opening 
up the hinterlands; so far, only 
Memnonia, the Martian capital, 
had provided Earthlings with any 
business. 

In the bow of the spaceship 
was a crowd of girls, a college 
graduating class. Some of them 
were dressed in the new skin-tight 
thermosuits which were stirring 
up so much fuss in the fashion 
magazines. Listening to their ecstatic, senseless chatter, Joyce 
suddenly felt immensely older. 
The day, thirteen months ago, 
when she first sighted the Memnonian landscape with her own 
class, seemed impossibly long 
ago . . . 

The ship nestled in against the 
vast loading ramp. A whistle 
sounded. The doors slid open. 
Husky, bare - chested Martian 
porters crowded aboard, began 
wheeling out the luggage. Joyce 
stepped out into the pale sunlight. The clear, thin air tingled

at her nostrils, dizzied her, as 
she'd known it would till she got 
used to it. She followed her porter 
down the ramp. It seemed to her, 
in her giddiness, that Gregrill 
himself was down there, down at 
the end of the ramp, bronzed, 
bare - armed, coming toward 
her — 

It was he! 

He had made the two-hundredmile trip to meet her! 

She began to run. She stumbled, caught herself on some\ 
body's arm, ran again, plunged 
against him, lost herself against 
his big, powerful chest. 

"Oh, Greg! Greg, you're here!" 

It was a long while before she 
could pull herself away to look 
at him. She had forgotten his 
strength, the magnificent arch of 
his chest. He was wearing a white 
fiber vest in the traditional style, 
sleeveless, cut low in front. His 
sun-washed skin glowed like polished bronze. The highlights 
shone on the strong, high arc 
of his nose, the ridge of his cheekbones. His fragile russet antennae 
swayed like wheat stalks in the 
wind. 

There were muttered complaints around her. She was 
being shoved, prodded. She'd 
hardly realized they were standing in the midst of the swarming 
passengers. 

"Oh," she laughed tremulously, 
"let's move. My luggage. Where 



— oh, there it is, that man over 
there with the cart." 

"I will get it," Gregrill said. 

"Oh, no, please." 

But he was already striding 
away, big and powerful, towering 
over most of the Earthlings who 
were scurrying past. She saw him 
give, something to the Martian 
porter, watched him swing the 
trunk up on his shoulder. It 
writhed in her, it devastated her, 
her father's contemptuous dismissal — "porters and janitors, 
that's all they're fit for." 

"Greg, put it down," she said 
frantically. "I won't have you 
carrying it!" 

He smiled at her indulgently. 
"It is not heavy." 

"I don't want you to," she 
pleaded. 

"Why do you not want me to?" 
he asked puzzledly. "Somebody 
must." 

But how could she say it? How 
could she discuss it at all? She 
walked beside him, dumbly. They 
went down the ramp to where 
the aircabs were loading. An 
Earthling company had put in 
all the air transport here ; the 
Martians themselves had never 
bothered to develop anything 
more advanced than the eshbrug, 
a lumbering, three-wheeled, sunpowered- vehicle. 

"We shall take the airbus," 
Gregrill said. 

"Oh, do we have to?" she asked. 



EDUCATION OF A MARTIAN 



93. 



"How else can we go?" 

"Can't we get an eshbrug?" 

He looked at her wonderingly. 
"To travel three times as long? 
I am aware that you are tired — " 

"I'm tired of a lot of things," 
she blurted. "I'm tired of all the 
smooth, cynical, streamlined — 
Right now, I'd rather walk the 
whole way than step into an 
Earthling airbus." 

He gave an uncertain laugh. "I 
am not sure that I understand 
your meaning." 

"I'll explain it some time." 

But how could she ever? He 
thought Earthlings were all such 
noble, shining, gifted creatures. 
How could she tell him of the 
rot at the heart of so many of 
them? 

"Come on," she insisted desperately. "Let's find an eshbrug." 

THE driver let them out at 
Gregrill's road. Gregrill shouldered the trunk, and they walked 
down past the irregular row of 
red, sunbaked, dome - shaped 
houses, each with its big tank in 
the rear for catching Mars' meager rainfall. Joyce felt a quickening, a surge of warmth, when 
she saw them and the quiet, openfaced people in their doorways, 
smiling their shy welcomes. She 
was coming home. 

She was coming home . . . 
Gregrill's mother and father 
were waiting just inside their 



door. They opened their arms; 
they hardly said a word. Joyce 
ran to them, folded them against 
her. She didn't mind the tears. 

She let them lead her into the 
main room, let them seat her, 
put pillows around her. She sat 
there bathing in their tenderness, 
their simple good-heartedness. 

Couldn't everybody see it? 
Why couldn't her father know it? 
These were the best people in the 
Universe! 

Dinner was an Earthling meal. 
Joyce had been looking forward 
to a dish of mrila, the Martian 
rice, and krulevak, the white fruit 
that tasted like luscious chicken 
meat. But Gregrill's parents had 
obviously felt that their humble 
foods were too mean for her exalted taste and they had gone to 
the expense of bringing in vegetables and meats from the Earthling import shop in Memnonia. 

Joyce hid her disappointment. 
She had an impulse to say, 
"Please, please don't mimic our 
Earthling ways. Stay the way 
you are. Don't spoil anything. 
Don't lose what you have." 

After dinner, Gregrill took her 
for a walk. Joyce had her thermosuit on now. The Sun was setting, and the startling cold of 
the Martian night was coming 
in fast. Gregrill changed his fiber 
vest for a sleeved jacket, though 
of the same light material. It was 
incredible how little protection 



94 




 



these people needed against the 
cold. But, of course, they'd 
adapted to it. 

They walked along the edge of 
the gorge that cut through the 
stunted forest half a mile from 
Gregrill's home. The rough sides 
of the gorge rose sheer and splendid, a marvel of glittering color — ■ 
red, orange, yellow, brown. Far 
down on the rocky bed, a shallow stream flowed sluggishly to 
the south. 

Soon, as summer came on, the 
stream would quickly deepen. 
From the northern ice fields, a 
toircnt of blue water would come 
rushing down the gorges, and the 
heavy rains would come, and the 
red ground underfoot would turn 
to a miraculous green, and the 
mrila would sprout up like a rug 
of green velvet across the wide 
fields and the terraced hills. 

If she could only stay here, if 
tiny could only build their lives 
here with these simple, goodhearted people . . . 

But she knew it couldn't be. 
Gregrill would be wasted here. 
Earth, despite all its hatefulness 
for her. was the only place where 
his gcrrius would have a chance 
to unfold and display its potentialities. 

"It is time that we go back?" 
Gregrill asked. "You are cold?" 

Suddenly, helplessly, Joyce began to laugh. 

"What is it?" Gregrill said. 



confused by the sudden laughter. 

"The funny stiff way you 
talk!" She laughed on and on. 
She couldn't stop. 

"I am sorry," he said, turning 
aside, his face full of hurt. 

"Oh, no!" She caught his arm. 
"Don't misunderstand. I love the 
way you talk. I want you always 
to talk the way you do now. 
Don't change — please don't ever 
change. I love you just as you 
are." 

|^REGR1LL got his visa five 
days later. It was a complicated affair. Joyce had to sign 
half a dozen affidavits at the 
Earthling consulate, all certifying in one way or another that 
she intended to marry Gregrill as 
soon as they reached Earth, and 
that she guaranteed he wouldn't 
become a public charge. It was 
practically the only way a Martian had of getting to Earth. 

It infuriated her, this stupid 
legislation by which Earth denied 
itself everything these people 
could contribute to its culture. A 
few years ago, the Earthling government had admitted several 
thousand Martians to fill the 
pressing shortage of menial labor, 
and had permitted Venusians to 
take jobs as room stewards and 
waiters on the spaceships; and by 
that trivial concession, it had felt 
it was fulfilling its obligations to 
the Interplanetary Union.*

When would it learn what its 
narrow prejudices were costing? 
Would it have to wait till someone like Gregrill stepped forward 
and demonstrated all the richness it was missing? 

The formal good-bys had been 
said. The neighbors had held a 
party for them. It had been in a 
clearing behind the houses, out in 
tt'.: clean, lemon-yellow sunlight. 
They had eaten roasted trork, the 
crustacean delicacy from the 
northern gorges, and mrila made 
into candied patties. Gregrill's 
mother and father had danced 
the grave, stately farewell dance. 
And now. on their final evening 
on Mars, Joyce and Gregrill were 
taking their last walk along the 
deep, echoing gorge. 

She had just been watching 
him finish his packing, and the 
pain of it still sat in her throat. 
He had included his college books 
— every one of his texts and notebooks — packing them in so reverently, so pathetically confident 
that all he had to do was follow 
his. classroom precepts, and recognition and success would come 
tumbling into his hands . . . 

"I hope that your parents will 
like me as well as my parents 
like you." Gregrill said. 

"Oh, yes," Joyce assured him 
hoarsely. 

"Perhaps they will not be 
pleased that you marry a Martian ." 



"No. Greg, no. They'll—" But 
she couldn't carry it on. 

He turned to face her; he 
looked at her hard. He was starting to speak, to ask the obvious 
questions, but she Hung herself 
against him. 

"Greg! Let's get married here! 
Let's get married before we 
leave." 

He held her away from him so 
he could look at her. "But you 
had wished to be married oa 
Earth," he said bewilderedly. 

"I know, but I've changed my 
mind. I want it here, now. Oil, 
Greg. I'm afraid . . ." 

His big russet eyes narrowed, 
his high-winged nostrils flared, 
scenting danger. "You are afraid 
of what?" he asked quietly. 

"I don't know, Greg. I — I'm 
just afraid something will happen, something will go wrong, I 
don't know what." She couldn't 
look him in the eyes. "Let's get 
married here, in the morning, 
before we leave. Then we'll be 
married. 

"Nothing can go wrong." 

"Will not your parents be angered that you — " 

"No, no,. Greg. It'll be all right. 
This is the best way, believe me." 

"I believe you," he said grave
ly
And it caught her again, his 
small-boy solemnity. She was 
caught in a burst of helpless 
laughter. "Oh, Greg, I love you!" 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



THEY were married by a Martian priest in a small reddraped temple in Memnonia, not 
far from the spaceport. The ceremony was without words, like all 
religious rites on Mars. The tall, 
round-bodied priest, a huge cylinder of a man in heavy ritual 
fiber robes, stood facing them, his 
hands stiff against his sides, his 
eyes closed, his heavy features 
motionless. 

Joyce closed her eyes, too. She 
strained to hear, feel, sense something of what was passing between the priest and Gregrill, 
Surely, if she strained hard 
enough, she would catch some 
echo, some aura. But the air defied her; she was deaf, blind, insensate ; she was cut off irrevocably from this higher level of 
communication. Perhaps their 
children . . . 

"He is saying the words now," 
Gregrill whispered in her ear. 
"You two together . . . comfort 
each other . . . against the darkness and the drought . . . through 
the long dry misery of winter . . . 
when the water is locked and 
nothing, grows . . . till the glad 
day of rain and running streams 
. . . you two together . . , comfort 
each other . . ." 

"Say yes, my darling," Gregrill 
told her. 

"Yes, yes! Oh, yes!" 
They were outside, striding exultantly through the sunshine, the 



light wind tossing their hair, and 

the woi'dri kept sinking to tier.: 
"Through the long dry misery of 
winter . . . till the glad day of 
rain . . ." 

Oh, yes, Greg! Yes! 

When they reached the spaceship, their bags had already been 
taken to their stateroom, unpacked, the clothing arranged in 
the dressers — the meticulous work 
of the |Venusian stewards. Even 
the bedcovers were turned down, 
her nightgown laid out. 

"Greg," she said in a rush of 
embarrassment, "let's go out and 
watch the . . . watch how we 
take off." 

"You go, and I shall join you 
soon," he said. "I must wash and 
anoint myself as a bridegroom." 

Joyce went down the corridor 
into the observation rotunda. The 
huge semicircular window was 
cluttered with jabbering passengers. She squeezed in among 
them, but she stayed only a moment. She pushed her way back 
out and went to a table near the 
head of the corridor, and waited 
restlessly for him. Midway down 
the corridor, a Venusian steward, 
a scrawny little gray-skinned, 
long-beaked fellow, was running 
a cleaning machine over the floor. 
She smiled at him, but he turned 
his face shyly away. 

And then Gregrill came, moving up the corridor with his lithe, 
magnificent grace. 



EDUCATION OF A MARTIAN 



His wet h;iir glistened. 

"Greg, you look wonderful!" 
she cried, instantly aware of how 
foolish she sounded. 

He speeded his steps. He didn't 
see the cleaning hose in his path. 
The Venu:;ian moved quickly to 
pull it aside, but it caught Gregrill's foot. He stumbled, caught 
himself on the . corridor rail. 
Swiftly he turned, his arm swung 
out, his forearm slammed against 
the jaw (if the Httle Venusian, 
sending him crashing down 
against his cleaning machine. 
Gregrill looked down at him a 
moment. Then he turned, gave 
Joyce a broad smile and walked 
to her table. 

"Greg." Her throat was dry. 
"Why did you do that? He didn't 
mean it." 

"It is his duty to avoid such 
accidents," Gregrill said. 

"But look, he's still lying there. 
Let's go help him." 

"Leave him there," he said. "He 
is only a Venusian." 

"Only a—?" 

"Venusian." His lips curled. 
"They are the scum of the Solar 
System." 

The tremor that went through 



her was lost in the thrust of the 
jets as the ship took off. 

"They are not even fit for 
cleaning floors," Gregrill said. He 
suddenly smiled. "Do you not see 
the change I have made?" He 
gestured at his head. 

Through tear-blinded eyes, she 
saw his glossy waves of hair. The 
antennae were gone! 

"It hurt only a little," he said. 
"I could not wait until I had 
them off. I have been ashamed of 
them for so long." 

Lord, who was this person she 
had married? She didn't know 
him! 

"I see that you arc still upset," 
he said. "Please understand that 
these Venusians must be kept in 
their place." 

It was some stranger. She 
couldn't be married to him. She 
couldn't! 

"I wonder if I look like an 
Earthling now." he said. "Tell 
me, do you think that I look a 
little like your father and his 
friends?" 

She answered him wearily, defcatedly : "Yes, Greg. You do. 
Exactly."
