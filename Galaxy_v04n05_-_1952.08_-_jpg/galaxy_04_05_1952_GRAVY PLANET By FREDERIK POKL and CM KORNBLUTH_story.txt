GRAVY PLANET By FREDERIK POKL and C. M. KORNBLUTH 



"MITCH!" Kathy said 
dazedly. "My God, 
Mitch!" She laughed. 



with a note of hysteria. "You 
wouldn't wait, would you?" 

The astrologer took the gun 
out of his pocket. '*Is there — " 

"No, Warren. It's all right. 
Y v ou can leave us alone. Please." 

He left. Kathy dropped into a 
chair, trembling. I couldn't move. 
My wife — a king-pin Connie! I 
had thought I'd known her; I'd 
been wrong. She had lied to me 
continuously and I had never 
known it. 



I had loved a lie and not a 
woman at all. 

"Shocked?" she asked. "You, 
a star class copysmith, consorting with a Connie? Afraid it'll get 
out and do you no good businesswise?" She forced a mocking 
smile that broke down as I looked 
at her. "Damn it," she flared, "all 
I ever asked from you after I 
came to my senses was to get 
out of my life and stay out. The 
biggest mistake I ever made was 
keeping Taunton from killing 
you." 

"You had Runstead shanghai 
me?" 

"Like a fool. What in God's 
name are you doing here? Why 
can't you leave me alone?" 

Kathy a Connie. Runstead a 
Connie. Deciding what was best 
for poor Mitch and doing it. 
Taunton deciding what was best 
for poor Mitch and doing it. 
Moving me this way and that. 

I picked her up and slapped 
her. The staring intensity left her 
eyes and she looked merely- surprised. 

"Get what's-his-name in here," 
I said. 

"You can't order me — " 

"You!" I yelled. "The witchdoctor!" 

He came running, right into my 
fist. Kathy was on my back, a 
clawing wildcat, as I went 
through his pockets. I found the 
gun — a wicked .25 UHV machine

pistol — and shoved her to the 
floor. She looked up at me, 
mechanically rubbing a bruised 
hip. "You're a mean idiot," she 
said wonderingly. 

"Not idiot," I said. "Does 
Fowler Schocken know you're 
on the Moon?" 

"No," she said, rubbing her 
thumb and forefinger together. 

"You're lying. I told you that 
gesture gives you away." 

"My little iic-dctector," she 
said jccringly. "My little fireeating copysmith — " 

"Level with me or you get this 
thing across the face." 

"You mean it!" She put her 
hand to her face slowly, looking 
at the gun. 

"I'm glad that's settled. Does 
Fowler Schocken know you're 
on the Moon?" 

"Not exactly." She was still 
watching the gun. "He did advise 
me to make the trip — to help me 
get over my bereavement." 

"Call him. Get him here." 

She didn't say anything or 
move to the phone. _ 

"Listen." I said. "This is Groby 
talking. Groby's been slugged, 
knifed, robbed and kidnapqd. He 
saw the only friend he had poisoned a few hours ago. He's been 
played with by a lady sadist who 
knew her anatomy lessons. He 
killed her for it and he was glad 
of it. He's so deep in hock to 
Chtoretla that he'll never get out. 



He's wanted for femicide and 
breach of contract. The woman 
he thought he was in love with 
turned out to be a lying fanatic, 
a Connie bitch. Groby has nothing to lose. I can put a burst 
through the dome up there and 
we'll all suck space. I can walk 
out into the street, give myself 
up and tell exactly what I know. 
They won't believe me, but they'll 
investigate to make sure, and 
sooner or later they'll get corroboration — after I've been brainburned, which doesn't matter. 
I've got nothing to lose." 

"And," she asked flatly, "what 
have you got to gain?" 

"Stop stalling. Call Schocken." 

"Not without another try, 
Mitch. One word hurt — 'fanatic* 
There were two reasons why I 
begged Runstead to shanghai 
you: I wanted you out of the 
way of Taunton's killers, and I 
wanted you to get a taste of the 
consumer's life. I thought I'd be 
able to talk sense to you after we 
brought you back to life, and 
we'd be able to work together on 
the only job worth /doing. So it 
didn't work. That damned brain 
of yours — so good and so warjK-d. 
All you want is to be star class 
again and eat and drink and 
sleep a little better than anybody 
else. Well. I tried. 

"Go ahead and do whatever 
you think you have to do. It's 
not going to hurt worse than the 



GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTION 



nights we used to spend screaming at each other. Or the times I 
was out on Connie business and 
couldn't tell you and had to 
watch you being jealous. Or shipping you to Chlorella to try to 
'make you a whole sane man in 
spite of what copysmithing's done 
to you. Or never being able to 
love you all the way, never being 
able to give myself to you entirely, mind or body, because 
there was this secret. Pistol-whipping's a joke compared to the 
way I've been hurt." 

There was a pause that seemed 
to go on forever. 

"Call Schocken," I said unsteadily. "Tell him to come here. 
Then get out and take the stargazer with you. I — I don't know 
what I'm going to tell Schocken. 
But I'm going to give you and 
your friends time to change headquarters and hailing signs and 
the rest of your insane rigmarole. 
Call Schocken and get out of 
here. I don't want to see you 
again." 

I couldn't read the look on her 
face as she picked up the phone 
and punched a number. 

"Mr. Schocken's sec 3 , please," 
she said. "This is Dr. Nevin — 
widow of Mr. Courtenay. You'll 
find me. on the through list. Mr. 
Schocken's sec 2 , please. . . . This 
is Dr. Nevin, Mr. Courtenay's 
widow. May I speak to Mr. 
Schocken's secretary? I'm listed 



. . . Hello, Miss Grice; this is 
Dr. Nevin. May I speak to Mr. 
Schocken?" She turned to me. 
"I'll have to wait a few moments." 
They passed in silence. "Hello, 
Mr. Schocken. I wonder if you 
could come and see me about a 
matter of importance, business 
and personal . . . The sooner the 
better, I'm afraid . . . Shopping 
One, off Receiving — Dr. Astron's 
. . . No, nothing like that. It's just 
a convenient meeting place. 
Thank you very much, Mr. 
Schocken." 

I wrenched the phone from her 
and heard Fowler Schocken's 
voice say: "Quite all right, my 
dear. The mystery is intriguing. 
Good-by." Click. The voice was 
unmistakable. It brought back 
memories of Board mornings with 
their brilliance of ingenuity, hard 
and satisfying hours of work climaxed with a "Well done!" 1 was 
almost home. 

Silently and efficiently, Kathy 
was shouldering the stargazer's 
limp body. Without a word, she 
walked from the observatory. A 
door opened and closed. 

The hell with her . . . 

TT was minutes before there was 
a jovial halloo from Fowler 

Schocken: "Kathy! Anybody 

home?" 

"In here," I called. 

Two of our Brinks men and 

Fowler Schocken came in. His 



GRAVY PLANET 



109 



face turned a mottled purple. 
"Where's — " he began. And then: 
"You looked like — you are! 
Mitch!" He grabbed me and 
waltzed me hilariously around 
the circular room while the 
guards dropped their jaws. "What 
kind of trick was that to play on 
an old man? What's the story, 
boy? Where's Kathy?" He stopped, puffing even under Moonweight. 

"I've been doing some undercover work," I said. "I'm afraid 
I've got myself into some trouble. 
Would you call for more guards? 
We may have to stand off Luna 
City Inc.'s protection men." Our 
Brinks guards grinned happily 
at the thought. 

"Sure, Mitch. Get it done," he 
said to the sergeant, who went 
eagerly to the phone. "Now 
what's all this about?" 

"For the present," I said, "let's 
say it's been a field trip that went 
sour. Let's say I downgraded myself temporarily and voluntarily 
to assess the Venus project sentiment among the consumers — and 
I got stuck. Fowler, please don't 
push me for any more details. 
I'm in a bad way. Hungry, tired, 
scared, dirty." 

"All right, Mitch. You know 
my policy — find a good horse, 
give him his head and back him 
to the limit. You've never let me 
down, and God knows I'm glad 
to see you around again. Venus 



Section can use you. Nothing's 
going right. The indices are down 
to 3.7 7 composite for North 
America when they should be 4.0 
and rising. And turnover? Enormous! I'm here recruiting, you 
know: a little raid on Luna City 
Inc., Moon Mines and the other 
outfits for some space -seasoned 
executives." 

It was good to be home. "Who's 
heading it up?" I asked. 

"I am. We rotated a few Board 
men through the spot and there 
wasn't any pickup. In spite of my 
other jobs, I had to take over 
Venus Section direct. Am I glad 
to see you!" 

"Runstead?" 

"He's vice-ing for me, poor 
man. What's this jam you're in 
with the guards? Where's 
Kathy?" 

"I'm wanted for femicide and 
contract breach on Earth. Here 
I'm a suspicious character without clearance. Also I resisted 
arrest, clouted a guard and damaged Luna City property." 

He looked grave. "You know, 
I don't like the sound of CB," 
he said. "I assume there was a 
flaw in the contract?" 

"Several," I assured him. 

He brightened. "Then we'll pay 
off the fines on the rest- of the 
stuff and fight the CB clear up 
to the Chamber of Commerce 
if we have to. What firm?" 

"Chlorella Costa Rica." 



no 




 



"Hmm. Middling - sized, but 
solid. Excellent people, all of 
them. A pleasure to do business 
with." 

Not from the bottom, I 
thought, but said nothing. 

"I'm sure they'll be reasonable. 
If they aren't, I have a majority 
of the C of C in my pocket anyway. I ought to get something 
for my retainers, eh?" He dug me 
slyly in the ribs. His relief at getting Venus Section off his neck 
was overwhelming. 

A dozen of our Brinks boys 
churned in. 

"That should do it," Fowler 
Schocken beamed. "Lieutenant, 
the Luna City Inc. protection 
people may try to take Mr. Courtenay here away from us. We 
don't want that to happen, do 
we?" 

"No, sir," said the lieutenant, 
dead-pan. 

"Then let's go." 

"TTEY, you !" a stray Burns 
patrol man bawled. We 
were in somewhat open order. 
Evidently he didn't realize that 
the Brinks men were my escort. 

"Go play with your marbles, 
punchy," a sergeant told him. 

He went pale, but beeped his 
alarm and went down in a tangle 
of fists and boots. 

Burns patrolmen came bounding along the tunnel-like street 
in low-gravity strides. Faces ap


peared in doorways. Our detail's 
weapons - squad leader said, 
"Hup!" and his boys began to 
produce barrels, legs, belts of 
ammo and actions from their uniforms. Snap-snap-snap-snapsnap, and there were two machine 
guns mounted on the high tripod 
ready to rake both ends of the 
street. The Burns men braked 
grotesquely yards from us and 
stood unhappily swinging their 
nightsticks. 

Our lieutenant called out: 
"What seems to be the trouble, 
gentlemen?" 

A Burns man called back: "Is 
that man 'George Groby?'' 

"Are you George Groby?" the 
lieutenant asked me. 

"No. I'm Mitchell Courtenay." 

The weapons men full -cocked 
their guns at a signal from the 
squad leader. The two clicks 
echoed from the vaulting and the 
few last-ditch rubbernecks hanging from the doors vanished. 

"Oh," said the Burns man. 
"That's all right, then. You can 
go ahead." He turned on the rest 
of the patrolmen. "What the hell 
are you dummies waiting for? 
Didn't you hear me?'* 

They beat it, and we moved on 
down Commercial One, with the 
weapons men cradling their guns. 
The Fowler Schocken Associates 
Luna City Branch was 75 Commercial One. and we went in 
whistling. The weapons men

til 




 




mounted their guns in the lobby. 

It was a fantastic performance., 
I had never seen its like. Fowler 
Schocken explained it as he led 
me down into the heart of the 
agency. "It's frontier stuff, Mitch. 
Something you've got to get into 
your copy. 'The Equalizer' is 
what they call it. A man's rank 
doesn't mean much up here. A 
well-drilled weapons squad is the 
law topside of the stratosphere. 
It's getting back to the elemental 
things of life, where a man's a 
man no matter how high his 
Social Security number." 

We passed a door. "O'Shea's 
room," he said. "He isn't in yet, 
of course. The little man's out 
gathering rosebuds while he may 



— and the time isn't going to be 
long. The only Venus roundtripper. We'll lick that, won't we, 
Mitch?" 

He showed me into a cubicle 
and lowered the bed with his own 
hands. "Cork off with these," he 
ssfid, producing a sheaf of notes 
from his breast pocket. "Just 
some rough jottings for you to go 
over. I'll send in a guard with 
food and CofHest. A good hour 
or two t of work and then the 
sound sleep of the just, eh?" 

"Yes, Mr. Schocken." 

He beamed at me and left, 
drawing the curtain. I stared 
glazedly at the rough jottings. 
"Six-color doubletrux. Downhold

There was a pencil and copypaper in the cubicle. I began to 
write painfully: "We were ordinary guys. We liked the Earth 
and the good things it gave us.

the first drag on a Starr . . . the 
good feel of a sharp new Verily 
pinstripe suit . . . s warm smile 
from a girl" in a bright spring 
dress — but they weren't enough. 
There were far places we had to 
see, things we had to know. 

"The little guy's Learoyd, 19^9. 
I'm Holden, 1961. The redhead 
with the shoulders is McGill, 
2002. Yes, we're dead. But we 
saw the far places and we learned 
what we had to learn before we 
died. The longhair astronomers 
could only guess about Venus. 
Poison gas, they said. Winds so 
hot and so strong they'd pick you 
up and throw you away in cinders. But they weren't sure. What 
do you do when you aren't sure? 
.You go and see." 

A guard came in with sandwiches and Comest. I munched 
and gulped ,and wrote with the 
other hand. 

"We had good ships for those 
days. They packed us and enough 
fuel to get us there. What they 
didn't have was enough fuel to 
get us back. But don't pity us; 
we had to know. There was always the chance that the longhairs were wrong, that we'd be 
able to get out, breathe clean 
air, swim in cool water — and then 
somehow make enough fuel to 
bring the good news back. No, 
it didn't work out that way. It 
proved that the longhairs knew 
their stuff.

"Learoyd didn't wait to starve 
in his crate; he opened the hatch 
and breathed poison after writing up his log. My crate was 
lighter. The ^wind picked it up 
and broke it — and me with it. 
McGill had extra Tations and a 
heavier ship. He sat and wrote 
for a week and then — well, it 
was pretty certain after two noreturns. He'd taken cyanide with 
him. But don't pity us. We went 
there and we saw it and, in a 
way, we sent back the news by 
not coming back ourselves. 

"Now you folks know what to 
do and how to do it. You know 
the longhairs weren't guessing. 
Venus is a mean lady and you've 
got to take the stuff and the 
know-how to tame her. She'll 
treat you right when you do. 
■ When you find us and our crates, 
don't pity us. We did it for you. 
We knew you wouldn't let us 
down." 

I was home again. 

XIV 

PLEASE, Fowler," I said. 
"Tomorrow. Not today." 
He gave me a steady look. "I'll 
go along, Mitch. I've never been 
a back-seat driver yet." He displayed one of the abilities that 
made him boss-man by wiping 
clean out of his mind the burning curiosity about where I had 
been and what I had been doing.

"That's good copy," he said, 
slapping my work of the previous 
night on his desk. "Clear it with 
O'Shea, won't you? He can give 
it some extra see-taste -smelt hear-feel if anybody can. And 
pack for return aboard the Vilfredo Pareto — I forgot, you 
haven't got anything to pack. 
Here's some scratch ; shop when 
you get a chance. Take a few of 
the boys with you, of course. The 
Equalizer, remember?" He twinkled at me. 

I went to find O'Shea curled 
up like a cat in the middle of his 
full -sized bunk in the cubicle next 
to mine. The little man looked 
ravaged when he rolled over and 
stared blearily at me. 

"Mitch," he said thickly. 
" 'Nother goddam nightmare." 
He closed his bloodshot eyes. A 
thread of saliva lay along his 
miniature chin — puffy now, no 
longer perfectly chiseled. 

"Wake up, Jack." 

He jerked upright and held his 
smalt head. "I'm dying," he said 
faintly. "My deathbed advice is 
this: don't ever be a hero. Get 
me something, will you?" 

I went to the kitchen and 
punched Coffiest, Thiamax and a 
slice of Bredd. Halfway out, I 
returned, went to the bar and 
punched two ounces of bourbon. 

O'Shea looked at the tray and 
hiccoughed. "What the hell's that 
stuft 7" he asked, referring to the 



Coffiest. Thiamax and Bredd. He 
shot down the bourbon and shuddered. 

"Long time no see. Jack," I 
said. 

He groaned. "Why do cliches 
add that extra something to a 
hangover?" He tried to stand up 
to his full height of thirty-five 
inches and collapsed back onto 
the cot, his legs dangling. "I'm 
living up to my reputation and 
it's killing me. Ooh, that tourist 
gal from Nova Scotia! It's springtime, isn't it? Do you think that 
explains anything?" 

"It** late fall." 

"Maybe she doesn't have a 
calendar. Pass me that Coffiest." 
No "please" and no "thank you." 
Just a cool assumption that the 
world was his for the asking. He 
had changed. 

"Think you can do some work 
this morning?" I asked, my voice 
stiff. 

"I might," he said indifferently. 
"This is Schocken's party, after 
all. Say, what the hell ever became of you?" 

"I've been investigating." 

"Seen Kathy? That's a wonderful girl you have there, 
Mitch." His smile might have 
been reminiscent. AH I was sure 
of was that I didn't like it. 

He choked down his Coffiest 
and said, carefully setting it 
down : "What's that work you 
mentioned?" 



OIAVY PLANET 



T showed him my copy. He 
gulped the Thiamax and began 
to steady on his course as he 
read. 

"You got it all effed up," he 
said at last, scornfully. "I don't 
know Lcaroyd, Holden and McGill from so many holes in the 
ground, but like hell they were 
selfless explorers. You don't get 
pulled to Venus. You get pushed." 

"We're trying to convince people that they got pulled. What 
we want from you is sense-impressions to sprinkle the copy 
with. Just talking off the front of 
your face, how do you resonate 
to it?" 

"With nausea," he said, bored. 
"Would you reserve me a shower, 
Mitch? Ten minutes fresh, 100 
degrees. Damn the cost. You. too, 
can be a celebrity. All you have 
to do is be as lucky as I am." He 
swung his short legs over the 
edge of the cot and contemplated 
his toes, six inches clear of the 
floor. "I'm getting it while the 
getting's good. And am I getting 
it good. She must have been part 
Eskimo." 

"What about my copy?" 
-"See my reports. What about 
my shower?" ^ 

"See your valet," I said, and 
went out, boiling. In my own 
cubicle I sweated sense-impressions into the copy for a couple 
of hours and then picked up a 
guard squad to go shopping. 

116 



There were no brushes with the 
Burns patrolmen. I noticed that 
Warren Astron's shopfront now 
sported a chaste sign: 

Dr. Astron Regrets That 
Urgent Business 
Has Recalled Him to Earth on 

Short Notice 

I asked one of our boys: "Has 
the Ricardo left?" 

"Couple hours ago, Mr. Courtenay. Next departure's the Pareto, tomorrow." 
I could talk. 

OO I told Fowler Schocken the 
whole story. 
And Fowler Schocken didn't 
believe a word of it. 

He was nice enough and he 
tried not to hurt my feelings. 
"Nobody's blaming you. Mitch," 
he said kindly. "You've been 
through a great strain. It happens to us all, this struggle with 
reality. Don't feel you're alone, 
my boy. We'll see this thing 
through. There are times when 
anybody needs help. M y 
analyst — " 

I'm afraid I yelled at him. 
"Now, now," he said, still kind 
and understanding. "Laymen 
shouldn't dabble in these things, 
but I think I know a thing or 
two about it and can discuss it 
objectively. .Let me try to explain — " 

"Explain tfiis!" I yelled* at him, 


 



/ 



thrusting my altered Social Security tattoo under his nose. 

"If you wish," he said calmly. 
"Call it a holiday from reality. 
You've been on a psychological 
bender. You assumed a new identity, and you chose one as 
far-removed from your normal 
hard-working, immensely able self 
as possible. You chose the lazy, 
easy-going life of a scunvskimmcr. drowsing in the tropic 
Sun—" 

I knew then who was out of 
touch with reality. 

"Your slanders against Taunton's are crystal-clear to a person with some grasp of our 
unconscious drives. I was pleased 
to hear you voice them. They 
meant that you're getting back 
to your real self. What is our 
problem — the central problem of 
the real Mitchell Courtenay, star 
class copysmith? Lick the opposition ! Crush the competing 
firms! Destroy them! Veiled in 
symbols; obscured by ambivalent attitudes, the Taunton fantasy is nevertheless clear. Your 
imagined encounter with the girl 
'Hedy' might be a textbook example !" 

"Look at my jaw! See that 
hole? It still hurts!" 

He just smiled and said: "Let's 
be glad you did nothing worse to 
yourself, Mitch. The id, you 
see — " v 

"What about Kathy? What 



about the complete data on the 
Connies I gave you? Grips, hailing signs, passwords, meeting 

places?" 

"Mitch," he said earnestly, "as 
I say. I shouldn't be meddling, 
but they aren't real. Through 
sexual hostility, 'Groby' identified 
your wife with a hate-and-fear 
object, the Connies. And 'Groby' 
carefully arranged things so that 
your Connie data is uncheckable 
and therefore unassailable. 'Groby' arranged for you — the real 
you — to withhold the imaginary 
'data' until the Connies would 
have had*a chance to change all 
that. 'Groby' was acting in selfdefense. Courtenay was coming 
back and 'Groby' felt himself 
being squeezed out. Very well, he 
arranged things so that he can 
make a comeback — " 

"I'm not insane!" 

"My analyst — " 

"You've got to believe me!" 

"These unconscious conflicts — ** 

"I tell you Taunton has killers!" 

"Do you know what convinced 
me, Mitch?" 

"What?" I asked bitterly. 

"The fantasy of a Connie celt 
embedded in Chicken Little. The 
symbolism — well, it's quite unmistakable." 

I gave up except on one point: 
"Do people still humor the insane, Mr. Schocken?" 

"You're not insane, my boy. 



GRAVY PLANET 



You need help. You'll get it." 

"Will you humor me in one 
respect?" 

"Of course." 

"Guard yourself and me, too. 
Taunton has killers. All right, 
I think, or Groby thinks, or some 
damn body thinks that Taunton 
has killers. If you humor me to 
the extent of guarding yourself 
and me, I promise not to start 
swinging from the ceiling. I'll 
even go to your analyst." 

"Fine," he smiled, humoring 
me. 

Who could blame him? His own 
dreamworld was under attack by 
every word I had to* say. He 
couldn't believe that Mitchell 
Courtenay, copy smith, was sitting there and telling him such 
frightful things. 

They were hammer blows at 
him, but Fowler Schocken was 
nothing if not resilient. There was 
an explanation for everything 
and Sales could do no wrong. 
Therefore, Mitchell Courtenay, 
copysmith, was not sitting there 
telling him these things. It was 
Mitchell Courtenay's untamed id. 
1 suppose I was lucky, at that. He 
could have decided I was an impostor trying to subvert him and 
handed me over to the Burns 
Detective Agency. 

Some prehistoric research of 
my apprentice days recurred to 
me. I had found that, contrary to 
popular opinion, there had been 



no martyrs to science, ever. Roger 
Bacon had been comfortably imprisoned not because he had a 
fumbling, intuitive, mixed - up with-mysticism ne>tion of the scientific method, but because he 
had, from an incurably bad 
temper, violated a kind of nonaggression pact between the 
Dominicans and Franciscans. 
People hadn't cared about his 
truths. Copernicus hadn't been 
hailed before the Inquisition because he said the Earth moved 
around the Sun: it was because 
he had arrogantly and brutally 
denounced earlier astronomers 
who had done a good job with 
their limited instruments and 
math. People hadn't cared about 
his truths. 

If I persisted, Fowler Shocken 
might regretfully put me away 
as a psychotic, but he- didn't care 
about my truths. 

Truths? Truths? What truths?. 

The interests of producers and 
consumers are not always identical. 

Most of the world is not always 
happy. 

Workmen don't always automatically find the jobs they do 
best. 

Entrepreneurs don't always 
play a hard, fair game by the 
rules. 

The Connies are sane, intelligent and well-organized. 

In a free association fashion 




 



that would have delighted Fowler 
Shocken and his analyst, I said 
to myself: "You know, Mitch, 
you're talking like a Connie." 

I answered: "Why, so I am. 
That's terrible." 

"Well," I replied, "I don't know 
about that. Maybe . . .** 

"Yeah," I said thoughtfully. 
"Maybe . . ." 

It's an axiom of my trade that 
things are invisible except against 
a contrasting background. Like, 
for instance, the opinions and attitudes of Fowler Schocken, 

Humor me, Fowler, I thought. 
Keep me guarded. I don't want 
to run into an ambivalent fantasy 
like Hedy again. The symbolism 
may have been obvious, but she 
hurt me bad with her symbolic 
little needle. 

XV 

RUNSTEAD wasn't there when 
our little procession arrived 
in executives' country of the 
Schocken Tower. There were 
Fowler, me. Jack O'Shea, secretaries — and the weapons squads 
I had demanded. 

Runstead's secretary said he 
was down the hall, and we 
waited. I suggested that he 
wasn't coming back. After an 
hour, word got to us that a body 
had been found smashed flat on 
the first setback of the Tower, 
hundreds of feet below. It was 



very difficult to identify. 

The secretary wept hysterically 
and opened Runstead's desk and 
safe. Eventually we found a 
diary covering the past few 
months of Runstead's life. Interspersed with details of his work, 
his amours, memos for future 
campaigns, notes on good out-ofthe-way restaurants and the like 
were entries that said: 

"He was here again last night. 
He told me to try to hit harder 
on the shock-appeal, says the 
Starrzelius campaign needed 
guts. He scares hell out of mcUnderstand he used to scare 
everybody in the old days when 
he was alive . . . GWH again last 
night . . . Saw him by daylight 
for first time! Jumped and yelled, 
but nobody noticed. Wish he'd 
go away . . . He said I'm no good, 
disgrace to profession . . ." 

After a while we realized that 
"he" was the ghost of George 
Washington Hill, father of our 
profession, founder of the singing 
commercial, shock-value, irritation campaigns. 

"Poor fellow," said Schocken, 
white-faced. "Poor, poor fellow. 
If only I'd known. If only he'd 
come to me in time." 

The last entry said raggedly: 
"I know I'm no good. Unworthy 
of the profession. They all know 
it. Can see it in their faces. 
Everybody knows it. He told 
them. Damn him\" 



GRAVY PLANET

"Poor, poor fellow," said 
Schocken, almost sobbing. He 
turned to me and said: "You see? 
The strains of our profession . . 

Sure I saw. A prefabricated 
diary and an unidentifiable splash 
of protoplasm. It might have been 
180 pounds of Chicken Little 
down there on the first setback. 
But I would have been wasting 
my breath. I nodded soberly, 
humoring him. 

I was restored to my job at 
the top of the Venus Section. I 
saw Fowler's analyst daily. And 
I kept my armed guard. In tearful sessions. Fowler would say: 
"You must relinquish this symbol. It's all that stands between 
you and reality now, Mitch. Dr. 
Lawder tells me — " 

Dr. Lawder told Fowler 
Schocken what I told Dr. Lawder. And that was the slow progress of my "integration." I hired 
a medical student to work out 
traumas for me backward from 
the assumption that my time as a 
consumer had been a psychotic 
fugue, and he came up with some 
honeys. A few I had to veto as 
not quite consistent with my dignity, but there were enough left 
to make Dr. Lawder drop his 
pencil every once in a while. One 
by one we dug them up, and I 
have never been so bored in my 
life. 

But I would not surrender my 
insistence that my life and Fowl


er Schocken's were in danger. 

Fowler and I got closer and 
closer — he thought he had made 
a convert. I was ashamed to 
string him along. He was being 
very good to me. But it was a 
matter of life or death. The rest 
was sideshow. 

The day came when Fowler 
Schocken said gently: "Mitch, 
I'm afraid heroic measures are in 
order. I don't ask you to dispense with this barrier of yours 
against reality. But / am going 
to dismiss my guards." 

"You'll be killed. Fowler!" 

"I'm not afraid." Argument 
was useless. After a bit of it, acting on sound psychological principles, he told the lieutenant of 
his office squad: "I won't be 
needing you any more. Please report with your men to Plant Security Pool for reassignment. 
Thank you for your loyalty and 
attention to detail during these 
weeks." 

The lieutenant saluted, but he 
and his men looked sick. They 
were going from an easy job in 
executives' country to lobby patrol or night detail or mail guard 
or messenger service at ungodly 
hours. 

That night Fowler Schocken 
was garrotted on his way home 
by somebody who had slugged his 
chauffeur and substituted himself at the bicycle pedals of the 
custom-built Cadillac. The killer, 



120 




 



apparently a near-moron, resisted arrest and was clubbed to 
death, giggling. His tattoo had 
been burned off. He was unidentifiable. 

YOU can imagine how much 
work was done in the office 
the next day. There was a memorial Board meeting held and resolutions passed saying a great 
profession never would forget 
and so on. Messages of condolence were sent by other agencies, 
including Taunton's. I got some 
odd looks when I crumpled the 
Taunton message in my fist and 
used some very bad language. 
Commercial rivalry, after all, 
goes just so far. We're all gentlemen; a hard, clean fight and may 
the best agency win. 

But no Board member paid it 
much mind. They were all thinking of one thing: the Schockcn 
block of voting shares. 

Fowler Schocken Associates 
was capitalized at 7 x 10 12 megabux. voting shares par at Ml 
0.1, giving us 7 x 10 13 shares. Of 
these, 3.5 x 10 13 -{- 1 shares were 
purchasable only by employees 
holding AAAA labor contracts or 
better — roughly speaking, star 
class. The remaining shares by 
SEC order had been sold on the 
open market. As customary, 
Fowler Schocken himself had, 
through dummies, snapped these 
up at the obscure stock ex


changes where they had been put 
on sale. 

In his own name he held a 
modest .75 x 10 13 shares and distributed the rest with a lavish 
hand. I myself, relatively junior 
in spite of holding perhaps the 
number-two job in the organization, had accumulated via bonuses and incentive pay only 
about .7 x 10 12 shares. 

Top man around the Board 
table probably was Harvey Bruner. He was Schocken's oldest 
associate and had corralled .83 
x 1 1 3 shares over the years. 
(Nominally this gave him the 
bulge on Fowler — but he knew, 
of course, that in a challenge 
those other 3.5 x 10 13 -f-1 shares 
would come rolling in on carloads 
of proxies, all backing Fowler 
with mysterious unanimity. Besides, he was loyal.) He seemed 
to think he was heir- apparent, 
and some of the more naive Research and Development people 
were already sucking up to him. 
He was an utterly uncreative, 
utterly honest whcelhorse. Under 
his heavy hand, the delicate 
mechanism that was Fowler 
Schocken Associates would disintegrate in a year. 

If I were gambling, I would 
have given odds on Sillery, the 
Media chief, for copping the 
Schocken bloc, and on down in 
descending order to myself, on 
whom I would have taken odds— 



GRAVY PLANET 



long, long odds. That obviously 
was the way most of them felt, 
except the infatuated Bruner and 
a f< w dopes. You could tell. Sillery was surrounded by a respectful little court that doubtless 
remembered such remarks from 
Fowler as: "Media, gentlemen, 
is basic-basic!" and: "Media for 
brains, copysmiths for talent!" I 
was practically a leper at the end 
of the table, with my guards 
silently eying the polite battle. 
Sillery glanced at them once, and 
I could read him like a book; 
"That's been going on long 
enough; we'll knock off that eccentric first thing.*' 

What we had been waiting for 
came about at last. "The gentlemen from the American Arbitration Association. Probate Section, 
are here, gentlemen." 

They were of the funeral type, 
according to tradition. Through 
case -hardening or deficient sense 
of humor, they refrained from 
laughing while Sillery gave them 
a measured little speech of welcome about their sad duty and 
how we wished we could meet 
them under happier circumstances and so on. 

They read the will in a rapid 
mumble and parsed copies 
around. The part 1 read first 
said : "To my dear friend and 
associate Mitchell Courtenay, I 
bequeath and devise my ivory-inlaid oak finger- ring (inventory 

nx 



number 56.987) and my seventyfive shares of Sponsors' Stock in 
the Institute for the Diffusion of 
Psychoanalytic Knowledge, a 
New York non-profit corporation, 
with the injunction that he devote his leisure hours to active 
participation in this organization 
and the furtherance of its noble 
aim." 

Well, Afjfch, T told myself, 
you're through. I tossed the copy 
on the table and leaned back to 
take a swift inventory of my 
liquid assets. 

"Hard lines. Mr. Courtenay," 
a brave and sympathetic Research man I hardly knew told 
me. "Mr. Sillery seems pleased 
with himself." 

I glanced at the bequest to Sillery — paragraph one. Sure 
enough, he got Fowler's personal 
shares and huge chunks of stock 
in Managerial Investment Syndicate, Underwriters Holding Corporation and a couple of others. 

The Research man studied my 
copy of the will. "If you don't 
mind my saying so, Mr. Courtenay," he told me, "the old man 
could have treated you belter." 

I seemed to hear Fowler chuckling nearby, and sat bolt erect. 
"Why, the old so-and-so!" I 
gasped. It fitted like lock and 
key, with his bizarre sense of 
humor to oil the movement. 

Sillery was clearing his throat 
and an instant of silence de

 



scended on the Board room. "It's 
a trifle crowded here, gentlemen. 
I move that all persons other 
than Board members be asked to 
leave — " 

I got up and said: "I'll save 
you the trouble. Come on, boys. 
Sillery, I may be back." , 

npHE Institute for the Diffusion 
of Psychoanalytic Knowledge, 
a New York non-profit corporation, turned out to be a shabby 
three-room suite downtown in 
Yonkers. It was like something 
out of Dickens. Tnere was a 
weird old gal in the outer office 
pecking away at a typewriter. A 
sagging rack held printed pamphlets with fly-specks on them. 

"I'm from Fowler Schocken 
Associates," I told her. 

She jumped. "Excuse me, sir! 
I didn't notice you. How is Mr. 
Schocken? 1 * 

I told her how he was, and she 
began to blubber. He had been 
such a good man, giving so generously for the Cause. What on 
Earth would she and her poor 
brother ever do now? 
, "All may not be lost," I told 
her. "Who's in charge here?" 

She sniffled that her brother 
was in the inner office. "Please 
break it to him gently, Mr. 
Courtenay. He's so delicate and 
sensitive — " 

I said I would, and walked in. 
Brother was snoring-drunk. flop


ped over his desk. I joggled him 
awake and he looked at me with 
a bleary and cynical eye. "Washawan?" 

"I'm from Fowler Schocken 
Associates. I want to look at your 
books." 

He shook his head emphatically. "Nossir. Only the old man 
himself gets to see the books." 

"He's dead." I told him. 
"Here's the will." I showed him 
the paragraph and my identification. 

"Well," he said, sobering fast, 
"the joy-ride's over. Or do you 
keep us going? You see what it 
says there, Mr. Courtenay? He 
enjoins on you — " 

"I see it," I told him. "The 
books, please." 

He got them out of a surprising 
vault behind a plain door. 

Three hours of labor over 
them showed me that the Institute was in existence solely for 
holding and voting 56 per cent 
of the stock of an outfit called 
General Phosphate Reduction 
Corporation of Newark according to the whims of Fowler 
Schocken. 

I went "out into the corridor and 
said to my guards : "Come on, 
boys. Newark next." 

I won't bore you with the details. It was single-track for 
three stages and then it split. 
One of the tracks ended two 
stages later in the Frankfort Used 



GRAVY PLANET 



Machine Tool Brokerage Company, which voted 32 per cent of 
the Fowler Schocken Associates 
"public sale" stock. The other 
track forked again one stage later 
and wound up eventually in 
United Concessions Corp. and 
Waukegan College of Dentistry 
and Orthodontia, which voted the 
remainder. 

Two weeks later, on Board 
morning, I walked into the Board 
room with my guards. 

Sillery was presiding. He looked haggard and worn, as though 
he'd been up all night every night 
for the past couple of weeks looking for something. 

"Courtenay!" he snarled. "I 
thought you understood that you 
were to leave your regiment outside!" 

I nodded to honest, dumb old 
Harvey Bruner, whom I'd let in 
on it. Loyal to Schocken, loyal 
to me, he bleated: "Mr. Chairman, I move that members be 
permitted to admit company 
plant-protection personnel assigned to them in such number 
as they think necessary for their 
bodily protection." 

"Second the motion, Mr. Chairman," I said. "Bring them in, 
boys, will you?" My guards, 
grinning, began to lug in transfer 
cases full of proxies to me. 

Eyes popped and jaws dropped 
as the pile mounted. It took a 
long time for them to be counted 



and authenticated. The final vote 
stood: For, 5.73 x 10 ,;t ; Against, 
1.27 x 10 n . All the Against votes 
were Sillery's and Sillery's alone. 
There were no abstentions. The 
others jumped to my side like 
cats on a griddle. 

Loyal old Harve moved that 
chairmanship of the meeting be 
transferred to me, and it was carried unanimously. He then moved 
that Sillery be pensioned off, his 
shares of voting stock to be purchased at par by the firm and deposited in the bonus fund. 
Carried unanimously. 

Then— ja slash of the whip, just 
to remind them — he moved that 
one Thomas Heatherby, a junior 
Art man who had sucked up outrageously to Siljery, be downgraded from Board level and 
deprived without compensation of 
his small bloc of voting shares. 
Carried unanimously. Heatherby 
didn't even dare scream about it. 
Half a loaf is better than none, 
he may have said to himself, 
choking down his anger. 

It was done. I was master of 
Fowler Schocken Associates. And 
I had learned to despise everything for which it stood. 

XVI 

""I^LASH, Mr. Courtenay," said 
my secretary's voice. I hit the 
GA button. 

"Connie arrested in Albany on

neighbor's denunciation. ShaTI I 
line it up?" 

"How many times do I have to 
give you standing orders? Of 
course you line it up!" 

She quavered: "I'm sorry, Mr. 
Courtenay. I thought it was kind 
of far out — * 

"Stop thinking, then. Arrange 
the transportation." 

An hour later I was in the Upstate Mutual Protective Association's HQ. They were a local 
outfit that had a lot of contracts 
in the area, including Albany. 
Their board chairman himself 
met me and my guards at the elevator. "An honor," he burbled. 
"A great, great honor, Mr. 
Courtenay, and what may I do 
for you?" 

"My secretary asked you not 
to get to work on your Connie 
suspect until I arrived. Did you?" 

"Some of the employees may 
have roughed him up a little, informally, but he's in quite good 
shape." 

"I want to see him." 

He led the way, anxiously. He 
was hoping to get in a word that 
might grow into a cliency with 
Fowler Schocken Associates, but 
was afraid to speak up. 

The suspect was sitting on a 
stool under the usual dazzler. He 
was a middle-aged white-collar 
consumer of thirty or so. He had 
a couple of bruises on his face. 

"Turn that off," I ordered. 



A square-faced foreman s:»d: 
"But we always — " One of my 
guards, without wasting words, 
shoved him aside and switched 
off the dazzler. 

"It's all right, Lombardo," the 
board chairman said hastily. 
"You're to cooperate with these 
gentlemen/' 

I sat down facing the suspect. 
"My name's Courtenay. What's 
yours?" 

• He looked at me with pupils 
that were beginning to expand 
again. "Fillmore," he said, precisely. "Alonzo Fillmore. Can you 
tell me what all this is about?" 

"You're suspected of being a 
Connie." 

There was a gasp from all the 
UMPA people in the room. I was 
violating jurisprudence by informing the accused of the nature 
of his crime. 

I knew all about that and 
didn't give a damn. 

"Completely ridiculous," Fillmore spat. "I'm a respectable 
married man with eight children 
and another coming along. Who 
on Earth told you people such 
nonsense?" 

"Tell him who," I said to the 
board chairman. 

He stared at me, goggle-eyed, 
unable to believe what he had 
heard. "Mr. Courtenay, with all 
respect, the entire body of law 
respecting the rights of informers—** 



GRAVY PLANET 



125 



"I'll take the responsibility. Do 
you want me to put it in writing?" 

"No, no ! Nothing like that ! 
Please, Mr. Courtenay, suppose 
I tell the informer's name to you, 
understanding that you know the 
law and are a responsible person 
—and then I leave the room?" 

"Any way you want to do it is 
all right with me." 

He grinned placatingly, and 
Whispered in my ear: "A Mrs. 
Worley. The two families share 
a room. Please be careful, Mr. 
Courtenay — " 

"Thanks," I said. He gathered 
eyes like a hostess and nervously 
retreated with his employees. 

"Well, Fillmore," I told the 
suspect, "he says it's Mrs. Worley." He began to swear, and I 
cut him off. "You know your 
goose is cooked, of course. Remember what William Vogt says 
on the subject?" 

"Who?" he asked distractedly, 
z "Never mind. I have a lot of 
money. I can set up a generous 
pension for your family if you 
cooperate and admit you're a 
Connie." 

He thought hard for a few moments and then said: "Sure I'm a 
Connie. What of it? I'm sunk, so 
why not say so?" 

"If you're such a red-hot Connie, suppose you quote me some 
passages from Osborne." 

He had obviously never heard 
of Fairfield Osborne,' and slowly 



began to fake: "Well, there's the 
one that starts: 'A Connie's first 
duty, uh, is to, to prepare for a 
general uprising — ' I .don't remember the rest, but that's how 
it starts." 

"Now how about your cell 
meetings? Who comes there?" 

"I don't know them by name," 
he said more glibly. "We go by 
numbers. There's a dark-haired, 
fellow, he's the boss — " 

"Skip it," I told him. "You're 
no Connie. Don't worry about the 
pension. It goes through anyway." 

"Thanks, mister," he said in a 
small, dry voice. "I'm not begging. But can you make it big 
enough so they can move out of 
the room with the Worleys? He's 
a wolf. His wife's jealous and 
sore about him. I guess that's 
why' this happened. My wife told 
me and told me to inform on 
them before they informed on me, 
but I didn't listen. I didn't want 
to do anything like that. You 
shouldn't have to do anything 
like that just to get along — " 

He was crying when we left. 

I told the board chairman, 
hovering anxiously outside in the 
corridor: "I don't think he's a 
Connie." 

I was president of Fowler 
Schocken Associates and he was 
only the board chairman of a 
jerkwater local police outfit, but 
that was too much 1 . He drew himself up and said with dignity: 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



**We administer justice, Mr. 
Courtenay. And a basic tenet of 
justice is: 'Better that one thousand innocents suffer unjustly 
than one guilty person be permitted to escape.' " 

"I am aware of the maxim." 
I said. "Good day." I made a note 
to have the pension taken care 
of and left. 

MY instrument corporal went 
boing as the crash-crash priority signal sounded in ^his ear. 
and handed me the phone. It was 
my secretary back in Schocken 
Tower, reporting another arrest, 
this one in Pile City Three, off 
Cape Cod. 

We flew out to Pile City Three, 
which was rippling that day over 
a long, swelling sea. I hate the 
Pile Cities — as I've said, I suffer 
from motion sickness. 

This Connie suspect had tried 
a smash-and-grab raid on a jewelry store, intending to snatch a 
trayf ul of oak and mahogany 
pins, leaving behind a lurid note 
about Connie vengeance and beware of the coming storm when 
the Connies take over and kill all 
the rich guys. It was intended to 
throw off suspicion. 
He was very stupid. 
It was a Burns-protected city, 
and I had a careful chat with 
their resident manager. He admitted first that most of their 
Connie arrests during the past 



month or so had been like tha 
and then admitted that a// thei 
Connie arrests for the past month 
or so had been like that. Formerly they had broken up authentic 
Connie cells at the rate of maybe 
one a week. He thought maybe it 
was a seasonal phenomenon. 

From there I went back to New 
York, where another Connie had 
been picked up. I saw him and 
listened to him rant for a few 
minutes. He was posted on Connie theory and could quote Vogt 
and Osborne by the page. He 
also asserted that God had chosen 
him to wipe the wastrels from the 
face of Mother Earth" He said of 
course he was in the regular Connie organization, but he would 
die before he gave up any of its 
secrets. And I knew he certainly 
would, because he didn't know 
any. The Connies wouldn't have 
accepted anybody that unstable 
if they were down to three members with one sinking fast. 

We went back to Schocken 
Tower at sunset and my guard 
changed. It had been a lousy day. 
As far as results were concerned, 
it was a carbon copy of all the 
days I had spent since I inherited 
the agency. 

There was a meeting scheduled. 
I didn't want to go, but my conscience troubled me when I 
thought of the pride and confidence Fowler Schocken must 
have felt in me when he made me

his heir. Before I dragged myself 
to the Board room, I checked 
with a special detail I had set up 
in the company's Business Espionage section. 

"Nothing, sir," my man said. 
"No leads whatsoever on your — 
on Dr. Nevih. The tracer we had 
on the Chlorella personnel man 
petered out." 

"Keep trying," I said. "If you 
need a bigger appropriation or 
more investigators, don't hesitate. Do me a real job.**

probably thinking that the boss 
was a fool, mooning over a wife 
that was not even permanently 
married to him. What he made 
out of the others I had asked him 
to trace, I didn't know. They had 
vanished, each of my few contacts with the Connies in Costa 
Rica, the sewers of New York and 
on the Moon. Kathy had never 
come back to. her apartment or 
the hospital; Warren Astron had 
never returned to his sucker-trap 
on Shopping One; my Chlorella 
cellmates had vanished into the

jungle — and so it went, all down 
the line. 

l>OARD meeting. "Sorry to be 
late, gentlemen. I'll dispense 
with opening remarks. Charlie, 
how's Research and Development 
doing on the Venus question?** 

He got up. "Mr. Courtenay, 
gentlemen, in my humble way I 
think I can say that R. and D. is 
in there punching. Specifically, 
we've licked the greenhouse effect 
—-quantitatively. Experiments in 
vitro have confirmed the pre


dictions of our able Physical 
Chemistry and Thermodynamics 
section based on theory and math. 
A CO^ blanket around Venus at 
40,000 feet, approximately .05 
feet thick, will be self-sustaining 
and self-regulating, and will 
moderate surface temperatures 
some five degrees a year, steadying at 80 to 85 degrees. We're exploring now the various ways 
this enormous volume of gas can 
be obtained and hurled at high 
velocity into the stratosphere. 
"Considered broadly, we can 



GRAVY PLANET 



find the CO*, or manufacture it, 
or both. I say we should find it. 
Volcanic activity is present, but 
your typical superficial Venus 
eruption would seem to be liquid 
NH| compressed by gravity in 
crevices until it seeps to a weaker 
formation through faults and 
porous rock and then blows its 
top. We are certain, however, 
that deep drilling would tap considerable reservoirs of liquid 
CO,-" 

"How certain?" I asked. 

"Quite certain, Mr. Courtenay. 
Phase-rule analysis of the O'Shea 
reports — " 

I interrupted again. "Would 
you go to Venus on the strength 
of that certainty, other things 
being equal?" 

"Absolutely." he said, a little 
offended. "Shall I go into the 
technical details?" 

"No, thanks. Charlie. Continue 
as before." 

"At present, we are wrapping 
up the greenhouse effect in two 
respects. We are preparing a 
maximum probability map of 
drilling sites and we are designing a standard machine for unattended drilling. My policy on the 
design is cheapness, self-power, 
and remote control. I trust this is 
satisfactory?" 

"Very much so. Thank you , 
Charlie. One point, though. If 
the stuff is there and if it's abundant, we have a prospect of 



trouble. If it's too abundant and 
easy to get at, it might become 
feasible for Venus to export 
liquid CO* to Earth, which we 
definitely do not want. CO- is in 
good supply here, and no purpose 
would be served by underselling 
Earthside producers. Let's bear 
in mind always that Venus is 
going to pay its way with raw 
materials in short supply on 
Earth, and is not going to compete 
pricewise with the mother planet. 
Iron, yes. Nitrates, emphatically 
yes. We'll pay them a good 
enough price for such things to 
keep them buying Earthside products and enable them to give 
Earthside bankers, insurance 
companies and carrying trade 
their business. 

"But never forget that Venus 
is there for us to exploit, and

This is the time to head such 
mistakes off. I want you, Charlie,

gram before we go on?** 

Bernhard, our comptroller, 
stuck his hand up and I nodded. 

"Question about Mr. O'Shea,** 
he rumbled. "We're carrying him 
as a consultant at a very considerable fee. I've been asking 
around — I hope I haven't been 
going off-side, Mr. Courtenay, 
but it's my job— and I find that 
we've been getting no consultation whatever from him. Also, I 
should mention that he's drawn 
heavily in recent weeks on retainers not yet due. If we severed our connection with him at 
this time, he'd be owing us money. Also — well, this is trivial, but 
it gives you an idea. The girls in 
my department are complaining 
about him annoying them." 

My eyebrows went up. "I think 
we should hang onto him for 
whatever prestige rubs off. Ben. 
though his vogue does seem to 
be passing. Give him an argument 
about further advances. And as 
for the girls, I thought they 
didn't complain when he made 
passes at them." 

"Seen him lately?" 

I realized I hadn't. 

T>ACK in my office, I askul my 
night-shift secretary whether 
O'Shea was in the building and, 
if so, to send for him. 

He came in smelling of liquor 
and complaining loudly. "Damn 
it, Mitch, enough is enough! I 



just stepped in to pick up one of 
the babes for the night and you 
grab me. Aren't you taking this 
consultation thing too seriously? 
You've got my name to ust ; what 
more do you want?" 

He looked like a miniature of 
the fat, petulant, shabby Napoleon at Elba. But a moment after 
he -had come in, I suddenly 
couldn't think of anything but 
Kathy. It took me a moment to 
figure it out. 

"Well?" he demanded. "What 
are you staring at?" 

The liquor covered it up some, 
but a little came through : M enag* 
a Deux, the perfume I'd had 
created for Kathy and Kathy 
alone when we were in Paris, the 
stuff she loved and sometimes 
used too much of. I could hear 
her saying: "I can't help it, darling; it's so much nicer than formalin, and that's what I usually 
smell of after a day at the hospital . . ." 

"Sorry, Jack," I said evenly. 
"I didn't know it was your howling night. It'll keep. Have fun." 

He grimaced and left, almost 
waddling on his short legs. 

I grabbed my phone and slammed a connection through to my 
special squad in Business Espionage. "Put tails on Jack O'Shea. 
He's leaving the building soon. 
Tail him and everybody he contacts. Night and day. If I hit 
paydirt on this, you and your

men get upgraded and bonused. 
But God help you if you pull a 
butch!" 

XVII 

I GOT so nobody dared to come 
near me. I was living for 1 one 
thing only — the daily reports 
from the tails on O'Shea. Anything else I tried to handle bored 
and irritated me. 

After a week, there were twenty-four tails working at a time on 
O'Shea and people with whom he 
had talked. They were headwaiters, his lecture agent, girls, 
an old test-pilot friend of his 
stationed at Astoria, a cop he got 
into a drunken argument with 
one night — but was he really 
drunk and was it really an argument? — and other unsurprising 
folk. 

One night, quietly added to the 
list was: "Consumer, female, 
about 30, 5' 4", 120 lbs., redhead, 
eyes not seen, cheaply dressed. 
Subject entered Hash Heaven 
(restaurant) 1837 after waiting 
14 minutes outside and went immediately to table waited on by 
new contact, which table just 
vacated by party. Conjecture: 
subject primarily interested in 
waitress. Ordered hash, ate very 
lightly, exchanged few words 
with contact. Papers may have 
been passed, but impossible to 
observe at tailing distance. Fe


male operative has picked up contact." 

About thirty, five-foUr, onetwenty. It could be Kathy. I 
phoned to say : "Bear down on 
that one. Rush me everything 
new that you get. How about 
finding out more from the restaurant?" 

Business Espionage began to 
explain, with embarrassment, 
that they'd do it if I insisted, but 
that it wasn't approved technique. Usually the news got to 
the person being tailed and — 

"Okay," I said. "Do it your 
way." 

"Hold tt a minute, Mr. Courtenay. please. Our girl just checked 
in. The new contact went home to 
the Taunton Building. She has 
Stairs 17-18 on the thirty-fifth 
floor." 

"What's the thirty -fifth?" I 
asked, heavy-hearted. 
"For couples." 
"Is she — ?" 

"Unattached, Mr. Courtenay. 
Our girl pretended to apply for 
the vacancy. They told her Mrs. 
17 is holding 18 for the arrival of 
her husband. He's upstate harvesting" 

"What time do the stairs close 
at Taunton's?" 

"2200, Mr. Courtenay." 

I glanced at my desk clock. 
"Call your tail off her," I said. 
"That's all for now." 

I got up and told my guards: 




 



"I'm going out without you, 
gentlemen. Please wait here. 
Lieutenant, can I borrow your 
gun?" 

"Of course, Mr. Courtenay." 
He passed over a .25 UHV. I 
checked the magazine and went 
out on foot, alone. 

As I left the lobby of Schocken 
Tower, a shadowy young man 
detached himself from the wall 
and drifted after me. I crossed 
him by walking in the deserted 
street, a dark, narrow slit between the mighty midtown buildings. Monoxide and smog hung 
heavily in the unconditioned air, 
but I had antisoot plugs and he 
did not. I heard him wheeze behind me. An occasional closed 
cab whizzed past us, the driver 
puffing as he pumped the pedals. 

Without looking back, I turned 
the corner of Schocken Tower 
and instantly flattened against 
the wall. My shadow drifted past 
and stopped in consternation, 
peering into the gloom. 

I slammed the long barrel of 
the pistol against the back of his 
neck in a murderous rabbit punch 
and walked on. He was probably 
one of my own men, but I didn't 
want anybody's men along. 

I deliberately got to the Taunton Building's nightdweller entrance at 2159. Behind me the 
time-lock slammed the door. 
There was an undersized pay 
elevator. I dropped in a quarter, 



punched 35 and read notices 
while the elevator creaked upward : 

N IG HTDWEI.LERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN POLICING. 
MANAGEMENT ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEFTS, ASSAULTS OR RAPES. 

NIGHTDWELLERS NOTE THAT 
BARRIERS ARE UPPED AT 2210 
NIGHTLY AND ARRANGE THEIR 
CALLS OF NATURE ACCORDINGLY. 

RENT IS DUE AND PAYABLE 
NIGHTLY IN ADVANCE AT THE 
AUTOCLERK. 

MANAGEMENT RESERVES THE 
RIGHT TO REFUSE RENTAL TO PATRONS OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS. 

The door opened on the stairwell of the 35th floor. Men and 
women were squirming uneasily, 
trying to find some comfort before the barriers upped. I looked 
at my watch and saw 2208. 

I picked my way carefully in 
the dim light over and around 
limbs and torsos, with many apologies, counting. At the seventeenth step, I stopped at a 
huddled figure as my watch said 
2210. 

With a rusty clank, the barriers upped, cutting off step 17 
and 18, containing me and — 

She sat up, looking scared and 
angry, with a small pistol in her 
hand. 

"Kathy," I said. 



GRAVY PLANET 



She dropped the pistol. "Mitch? 
You fool!" Her voice was low 
and urgent. "What are you doing 
here? They haven't given up. 
They're still out to murder 
you — " 

"I'm putting my head into the 
lion's mouth to show I mean it 
when I say that you were right 
and I was wrong." 

"How did you find me?" she 
asked suspiciously. 

"Some of your perfume came 
oft' on O'Shea. Afena^e a Deux." 

She looked around at the 
cramped quarters and giggled. 
"It certainly is. isn't it?" 

"Cm not here to paw you, 
with or without your consent. 
I'm here to tell you that I'm on 
your side. Name it and you can 
have it." 

She looked at me narrowly and 
asked: "Venus?" 

"It's yours." 

'"Mitch," she said, "if you're 
lying—" 

"You'll know by tomorrow if 
we get out of here alive. Until 
then, there's nothing more to be 
said about it, is there? We're in 
for the night." 

"Yes," she said. And then, suddenly, passionately: "God, how 
I've missed you!" 

WAKEUP whistles screamed 
at 0600. They were loaded 
with skull-rattling subsonics, just 
to make sure that no slugabeds 



would impede the morning turnover. 

Kathy began briskly to stow 
away the bedding in the stairs. 
"Barriers down in five minutes." 
She lifted Stair 17's lid and fished 
around in it for a flat box that 
opened into a makeup kit. I 
yelped as a razor raked across 
the top of my right eyebrow. 
"Hold still!" It cut a swathe 
across my left eyebrow. Briskly 
she touched my face here and 
there with mysterious brushes. 

She turned up my upper lip 
and tucked a pledger of plastic 
under it. Two flesh -tinted tapes 
pasted my ears against my head 
and she said, "There." and showed me the mirror. 

"Good," I approved. 

"There go the barriers." she 
said tensely, hearing some preliminary noise that was lost on 
my inexperienced ear. 

The barriers clanged down. We 
were the only nightdwellers left 
on the 35th floor. But we were 
not alone. B. J. Taunton and two 
of his boys stood there. Taunton 
was swaying a little drunkenly, 
red-faced and grinning. Each of 
his boys had a machine pistol 
trained on me. 

Taunton hiccoughed and said: 

"This was a hell of an unfortunate place for you to go chippy-chasing, Courtenay ol' man. 
We have a photo-register for 
crashers like you. Girlie, if you 



194 



OALAXr SCIENCE FICTION 



will kindly step aside — " 

She didn't step aside. She 
stepped right into Taunton's 
arms, jamming her gun against 
his navel. His red face went the 
color of putty. 

"You know what to do," she 
said. 

"Boys," he said faintly, "drop 
the guns. For God's sake, drop 
them!" 

They did. T a un ton be ga n to 
sob. 

"Turn your backs," I told 
them, "and lie down." I had my 
borrowed UHV out. It felt wonderful. 

The elevator could easily have 
been flooded with gas, so we 
walked down the stairs. It was a 
long, wearying business, though 
all nightdwellers had been cleared hours ago for B. J.'s coup. He 
sobbed and babbled all the way. 

At the tenth floor landing, he 
wailed: "I've got to have a drink, 
Courtenay. I'm dying. There's a 
bar right here. You can keep that 
gun on me — " 

Kathy laughed humorlessly at 
the idea and we continued climbing down. 

k T the nightdweller exit. I 
draped my coat over Kathy's 
gun hand in spite of the winter 
outside. 

"It's all right!" B. J. called 
quavcringly to an astounded lobby guard who started our way. 



"These people are friends of mine. 
It's quite all right!" 

We walked with him to the 
shuUlemouth and dived in, leaving him, gray-faced and sweating, in the street. The only way 
he could get at us was by blowing up the entire shuttle, and even 
he wouldn't dare. 

We zigzagged for an hour and 
I called my office from a station 
phone. A plant protection detail 
rendezvoused with us at another 
station and . we were in the 
Schocken Tower fifteen minutes 
later. 

A morning paper gave us our 
only laugh so far that day. It 
<aid, among other things, that a 
coolant leak had been detected 
at 0545 today in the stairwell of 
the Taunton Building. B. J. 
Taunton himself, at the risk of 
his life, had supervised the evacuation of the nightdwellers in 
record time and without casualties. 

Over a breakfast tray on my 
desk, I told Kathy: "Your h.nr 
looks like hell. Does that stuff 
wash out?" 

"Enough of this love-making," 
she said. "You told me I could 
have Venus. Mitch, I meant it. 
Did you?" 

"I did then." 

"And now?" 

"All my life I've wanted the 
position I have now, Kathy. It 
was in every dream, something 



GRAVY PLANET 



is; 



so far off and desirable that I 
honestly never believed I'd reach 
it. But I did." 

"And now?" she repeated insistently. 

"If I hadn't found out what 
life is like on the consumer level, 
I think I'd be completely happy 
— assuming, of course, I could 
also have you." 

She shook her head with grim 
emphasis. "You couldn't." 

"That's not all it is, though — 
chucking the dream of a lifetime for a woman. I couldn't do 
it if the dream hadn't soured." I 
grabbed her hand, hung onto it 
as if I'd sink without it. "Kathy, 
I was brought up to think the 
Connies — the World Conservation Association — were crackpots. 
Look, I can't even say 'Connies' 
without flinching. And now I 
know the Conservationist viewpoint is profoundly intelligent. 
Don't you see what that does? It 
leaves me with nothing to believe 
in!" 

, Her hand tightened around 
mine. "There's Conservationism." 

"It wouldn't work. Kathy. I've 
thought about it and thought 
about it ever since I found out 
you were in the organization. I 
knew you'd never get mixed up 
in anything that didn't make 
sense; you're not the fanatic type. 
But let's suppose we could institute Conservationism right now. 
We'd have to cut back popula


tion, cut back production, cut 
back just about everything so we 
could conserve our natural resources. The economic dislocation would be tremendous. It 
would lead to wars, anarchy, 
starvation." 

"Do you think things can go 
on indefinitely as they are, 
Mitch?" she asked gently. 

"I don't know," I admitted. 
"Every time we've run out of 
something — coal, oil, various metals, whatever it was — we always 
came up with a substitute. Maybe not as good, maybe, in lots of 
cases, better than the original. 
The point is that the world is 
geared to increasing production, 
increasing population, synthetics, 
substitutes — Sales! You can't 
knock that over without knocking the world to pieces, Kathy!" 

"This world," she said. 

I looked at her vacantly. 

"We know it's too late to do 
anything about Earth, Mitch. 
We've known it for some time. 
That's why we want Venus — a 
young, unspoiled, unplundered 
planet, where we can start right 
and continue right. A Conserve* 
tionist world. Mitch!" 

"It's a broiling inferno of poison hurricanes, a dumping ground 
for our surpluses and that's all." 

"Not- to us, Mitch. We're the 
only people who know what to do 
with it. We landed tiie first man 
there !" My face must have gone 



136 




 



blank, for she said: "O'Shea is 
one of us." 

"Since when?" 

"Since his mother and father 
realized he wasn't growing. They 
knew we'd need space pilots soon 
—and the smaller the better. 
Earth didn't discover Venus. The 
W. C. A. did. We had to write 
this world off. To do that, we had 
to have another one." 

"But not that one!" I argued. 
"It's not fit for human life!" 

"We have our own research 
men, Mitch. We aren't fooling 
ourselves; you understand us well 
enough to know we're not myopic 
idealists. Venus can be turned 
into a good, healthy, habitable, 
prosperous planet. It won't be 
easy, but it can be done. And 
once it's done, it won't ever be 
undone the way Earth was." 

I sat there trying to eat breakfast and digest the ideas that had 
been hurled at me, both at the 
same time. I couldn't. I got up 
and began walking the office; the 
walls kept stopping me short 
every few paces. 

"Room, Mitch," she said. "Not 
these cramped little cubicles. Rail 
room where you can see the horizon and the sky. where you can 
build as small or as large as you 
please, where furniture doesn't 
have to be folded away so you 
can find enough space to turn in." 

"But I'm used to this. We all 
are." 



"We won't be when we get out 
of confinement. That's not the 
point, though. Venus belongs to 
us, Mitch. We demand the right 
to settle it." 

"God, it's going to be a headache!" I groaned. "We have our 
rosters filled with eager consumer* 
itching to get to Venus. Well, 
I'll backtrack." I punched the 
intercom to R. & D. "Charlie, 
about the COj competition with 
Earth producers. Forget it. I 
found that Taunton's bills most 
of the makers." 

"Fine. Mr. Courtenay," Charlie said happily. "The preliminary work looks as if w< *11 give 
them a real solid kick in the 
pants." 

I dropped the intercom key 
and said to Kathy: "Can you dig 
up Runstead for me? This is going to be a job. A copysmith's 
highest art is to convince people 
without letting them know they're 
being convinced. What I've got 
to do is unconvince people without letting either the copysmiths 
or the people know what's happening. I need Runstead for that." 

Kathy smiled. "Runstead committed suicide. Remember?" 

"Sure. We'll have to work out 
a cover-up story for that, I suppose. Next Conservationist meeting I go to, I'm going to suggest 
we use some less flamboyant way 
of getting people out when the 
heat's on." 



GIAVY PIANIT 



"It can be arranged," she said, 
kissing me. "That's for saying 
'we.* ** 

"What else can I say? Look, 
darling, I've got a dandy executive's living suite, a full twelve 
by twelve, upstairs. Suppose you 
go up and cork off for a while; 
you've had a hard night and I've 
got a lot of work to do." 

She kissed me energetically and 
said : "Don't work too hard, 
Mitch. I'll see you tonight." 

I COULDN'T have done it 
without Runstead — not in 
time. He came whistling back 
from retirement in response to 
some underground message from 
Kathy. 1 had broken it to the 
Board ahead of time — "Unusual 
tasks, gentlemen, demand unusual methods. We owe Matt an 
enormous debt of gratitude, every 
one of us, for having altered the 
whole structure of his personal 
life to free himself for certain research problems which even yet 
must remain confidential.*' 

The Board took the hint By 
ii cc la mat ion. they gave him half 
of Sillery's confiscated stork as a 
bonus. 

Matt arrived in the middle of 
a meeting. We shook hands for 
public consumption, and there 
never was any private discussion 
afterward. He kntw what the job 
was. 

I still thought Runstead was a 



rat. But I had to admit things 

were leaping. 

On the surface level. Fowler 
Schocken Associates had launched a giant all-client slogan contest, with fifteen hundred first 
prizes, all of them a berth on the 
Venus rocket. There were < it;ht 
hundred thousand prizes in all, 
but the others didn't matter. 
Judging was turned over to an 
impartial firm of contest analyzers, which happened to be headed 
by the brother-in-law of a protege of Runstead's. Only fourteen 
hundred of the prize-winners. 




13* 




 



Matt told me, were actually 
members of the Connie underground. The other hundred were 
dummy names entirely, to take 
care of last minute emergencies. 

I took Kathy with mr to Washington to spark the final clearance 
of the rocket for flight, while 
Runstead minded the baby back 
in New York. I'd been in Washington often enough for a lunch' 
eon or an afternoon, but this was 
going to be a two-day job: I 
looked forward to it like a kid. 
I parked Kathy at the hotel and 
made her promise not to do any 



solo sightseeing, then caught a 
cab to the State Department. A 
morose little man in a bowler hat 
was waiting in the anteroom. 
When he heard my name, he got 
up h astily and offered mc his 
seat. Quite a change from the 
Chlorella days, Mitch, old boy. I 
told myself. Abels, our attache, 
came flustering out to greet me: 
1 calmed him and explained what 
I wanted. 

"Easiest thing in the world. Mr. 
Courtenay," he promised. "1*11 
get the enabling bill put through 
committee this afternoon, and 




IW 



with any luck at all it'll clear 
both houses before noon tomorrow." 

I said expansively, "Need any 
backing?" 

"Might be nice for you to address the House in the morning, 
if you can find the time. They'd 
love to hear from you, and it 
would smooth things over a little 
for a quick passage." 

"Glad to," I said, reaching 
down for my bag. The man in the 
bowler hat beat me to it and 
handed it to me with a little bow. 
"Just set your time, Abels," I 
told the legate. "1*11 be there." 

"Thank you very much, Mr. 
Courtenay!" He opened the door 
for me. 

The little man said tentatively: 
"Mr. Abels?" 

The legate shook his head. 
"You can see how busy I am," 
he said, not unkindly. "Come 
back tomorrow." 

The little man smiled gratefully and followed me out the door. 
We both hailed a cab. He opened 
the door for me. 

"Can I drop you anywhere?" 
I asked. 

"It's very good of you," he 
said. 

The driver leaned back on his 
pedals and looked in at us. 

I told him: "The Park Starr 
for me. But drop this other gentleman off first." 

The driver nod ded . *' White 



House, Mr. President?** 

"Yes, please. I can't tell you 
how happy I am to meet you, 
Mr. Courtenay," the little man 
told me. "I overheard your conversation with Mr. Abels, I'm 
afraid. It was very interesting to 
hear that the Venus rocket is so 
near completion. Congress/' he 
said wistfully, "has got out of the 
habit of keeping me posted on 
what's going on. Of course, I 
know they're busy with their investigations and all, but — " Mischievously, he said : "1 entered 
your contest, Mr. Courtenay. My 
slogan was, 'I'm starry-eyed 
over Starrs, verily I am.' I don't 
suppose I could go along, though, 
even if I win." 

"I can't see how it would be 
possible. They must keep you 
pretty busy right here." 

"Oh, not particularly. JanUs 
ary's heavy; I convene Congress* 
you see, and they read me the 
State of the Union message. But 
the rest of the year passes slowly. 
Will you really address Congress 
tomorrow, Mr. Courtenay ? It 
would mean a joint session, and 
they usually let me come for 
that." 

"Be delighted to have you," I 
said cordially. 

The cab stopped and the President shook my hand warmly and 
got out. He poked his head in the 
door. "Uh," he said, looking apprehensively at the driver,

''you've been very good to me. I 
may be stepping out of line in 
saying this, but if I might make 
a suggestion — I understand something about astronomy, it's a 
kind of hobby, and I hope you 
won't delay the ship's takeoff 
past the present conjunction." 

I stared. Venus was within ten 
degrees of opposition and getting 
farther away — not that it mattered, since most of the trip 
would be coasting anyhow. 

He held a finger to his lips. 
"Good-by, sir," he said. I spent 
the rest of the trip staring at the 
backs of the driver's hairy ears, 
and wondering what the little 
man had been getting at. 

WE took the evening off, 
Kathy and I, to see the 
sights. The famous cherry blossoms were beautiful, all right, 
but. with my newfound Conservationist sentiments, I found 
them ostentatious. "A dozen 
would have been plenty," I objected. "Scattering them around 
in vase after vase this way is 
plain waste. You know what 
they'd cost in Tiffany's?" 

Kathy giggled. "Wait till we 
take over Venus. Did you ever 
think what it's going to be like 
to have a whole planet to grow 
things in? Acres and acres of 
flowers, trees, everything!" 

A plump schoolteacher - type 
leaning on the railing beside us 



straightened up, glared, sniffed 
and walked away. 

"Before you get us in trouble," 
I told Kathy, "let's go to — let's 
go back to the hotel." 

I woke up to an excited squeal 
from Kathy. "Mitch," she was 
saying from the bathroom, two 
round eyes peering wonderingly 
over the towel that was draped 
around her, "they've got a tub 
here! I opened the door to the 
shower stall, and it wasn't a stall 
at all! Can I, Mitch? Please?" 

There are times when even an 
h o n e s-t Conservationist rinds 
pleasure in being the acting head 
of Fowler Schocken Associates. I 
yawned and blew her a kiss and 
said, "Sure. And make it all fresh 
water, hear?" 

While the tub was filling, I 
punched the communicator and 
got the morning summary relayed from Schocken Tower. Miss 
Hinkle's flat tones held nothing 
of interest that morning. I sighed 
briefly for Hester, who always 
managed to find something worth 
mentioning. It was hard to believe that Hester had been dead 
less than a month. 

And, I remembered, I still 
hadn't found out who had killed 
her with the poison meant for 
me. Taunton was out; they hadn't 
known I was on the ship. Connies? Not with Kathy directing 
them, not after she'd gone to such 
pains to save my life before.

For instance: 

Kathy and Matt Runstead and 
Jack O'Shea had plotted together 
to put me on ice — literally. All 
right, that accounted for most of 
the things that had puzzled me. 
But it didn't account for Hester. 
And. when you stopped to think 
of it, it didn't account for all of 
Runstead's work, either. 

The Connies were in favor of 
space travel. But Runstead had 
sabotaged the Venus test in CalMex. There was no doubt of 
that: I had as good as a confession from his fall-guy. Could 
it have been a doublecross? Runstead posing as a Connie who 
was posing as a copysmith, and 
in reality — what? 

It took half a minute to get 
through to New York. Hinklt's 
flat voice went up an octave when 
she heard me again., "Why, Mr. 
Courtenay !" 

"Get me Runstead." 

"He phoned in this morning to 
say he had an appointment out 
of town, Mr. Courtenay. He 
didn't say where." 

I deliberately controlled my 
voice. "And just why the hell 
wasn't that in the morning summary?" I demanded, and slapped 
down the off key before she could 
answer. 

I flung open the door to the 
bath. Kathy's face smiled star


tledly at me from the bath alcove, and then the smile flickered 
out. "Mitch," she whispt red. 
"What's the matter?" 

"I've got questions." I sat 
grimly on the edge of the tub, 
for once immune to the slim fair 
thighs and the firm breasts, and 
ticked the questions off on my 
fingers: "One, who tried to kill 
me on the Moon rocket? Two, 
what did Runstead have, to do 
Willi it? Three, what kind of fool 
do you think I am? Four, how 
fast can you think up Iks to 
answer me with?" 

The storm of weeping was 
answer enough. I didn't wait for 
any more. 

T HADN'T even rinsed the 
* morning beard off my face; I 
had stomped out of the hotel in 
too much of a rage to notice 
whether I was as tastefully dressed to speak before Congress as 
they might legitimately havi expected. And I didn't care. 

Just before I was scheduled to 
speak, our Washington lobby 
chief pushed through the crowd 
to me. He handed me a strip of 
facsimile paper. "It's all here, 
Mr. Courtenay," he said unhappily. "Uh, is everything all right?" 

"Everything's just fine," I told 
him, which was a lie. I waved him 
off and looked at the facsimile. 
It was from Dicken, on the scene 
at the rocket: 



142 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Passengers and crew alerted and on 
standby. First movement into ship begins at 1145 EST, loading completed 
by 1645 EST. Ship fully fueled, supplied and provisioned since 0915. Security invoiced, but MIA, CIC and 
Time-Lifa known to have filed coded 
dispatches through dummies. Chart 
room asks please remind you: Takeoff 
possible only in AM hours. 

I rubbed the tape between my 
palms; it disintegrated into ash. 
As I climbed to the podium, 
someone tugged at my elbow. It 
was the President, leaning out of 
his ceremonial box. 

"Mr. Courtenay," he whispered, "I guess you understood 
what I was trying to tell you 
yesterday in the cab. I'm glad 
the rocket's ready." He widened 
his grin. "You probably know 
this, but he's here." 

I had no chance to find out 
who "he" was. As the Speaker 
of the House came toward me, 
hand outstretched, and the applause started from the floor, I 
forced a smile. But it was a trick 
of the rictus muscles entirely. I 
had little to smile about. If the 
news about the Venus rocket had 
trickled down to the President, 
there wasn't a chance that I could 
pull a surprise on anyone — even 
if I could figure out whom I 
wanted to surprise. 

Fowler Schocken was a pious 
old hypocrite and a fraud, but if 
it hadn't been for Fowler Schocken I could never have got 
through that speech. I could hear 



his voice in my ears. "Sell 'em, 
Mitch; you can sell them if you'll 
keep in mind that they want to 
buy." And I sold the assembled 
legislators precisely what they 
wanted to own. The applause 
was fantastic. 

There were a dozen standing 
figures in the hall, clapping their 
hands and begging the Chair for 
recognition, including white-haired old Colbee, lean and dignified 
with his four deqades of service. 

"The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Coca-Cola." 

"Thank you very much, Mr. 
Speakuh." Colbcc's face wore a 
courtly smile. Coca -Cola was 
nominally one of the few big 
independents; but I remembered 
that Fowler had commented once 
on their captive agency's surprising closeness to Taunton. "If I 
may ventuah to speak for the 
Upper Chamber, I should like to 
thank ouah distinguished guest 
for his very well-chosen remarks 
heah. I am certain that we all 
have enjoyed listening to a man 
of his calibeh and standing." Go 
back to the Berlitz school, you 
Westchester phony, I thought 
bitterly. I could feel the weenie 
coming as Colbee rumbled on. 
"With the permission of the 
Chair, I should like to ask ouah 
guest a number of questions involving the legislation we have 
been asked to consider heah today." 



GRAVY PLANET 



143 



By now even the galleries had 

caught on to what was happening. 
I hardly needed to hear the disastrous rest: 

"It may have escaped youah 
attention, but we are fortunate in 
having with us another guest. I 
refer, of coarse, to Mr. Taunton." 
He waved gracefully to the visitor's gallery, where B. J.'s red 
face appeared between two stolid 
figures that I should have recognized at the first moment as his 
bodyguards. "In a brief discussion before ouah meeting heah, 
Mr. Taunton was good enough 
to give me some information 
which I would like Mr. Co'tenay 
to comment upon. First, I would 
ask Mr. Co'tenay if the name of 
George Groby, wanted for Contract Breach and Femicide, is 
familiar to him. Second, I would 
like to ask if Mr. Co'tenay is 
Mr. Groby. Third, I would like 
to ask Mr. Co'tenay if there is 
any truth to the repo't, given 
me in confidence by someone in 
whom Mr. Taunton assures me 
I can repose absolute trust, that 
Mr. Co'tenay is a membah in 
good standing of the World Conservation Association, known to 
most of us who are loyal consumers as — " 

Even Colbee himself could not 
have heard the last words of his 
sentence. 

The uproar was like a physical 
blast. 



XIX 

SEEN in retrospect, everything 
that happened in the next wild 
quarter of an hour blurs and disappears. But I remember frozen 
moments of time that seem almost to have no relation to each 
other : 

The waves of hatred that 
flowed around me, the contorted 
face of the President below me, 
screaming something unheard to 
the sound engineer in his cubicle, 
the wrathful eyes of the Speaker 
as he reached out for me. 

Then the wild motion halted 
as the President's voice roared 
through the chamber at maximum amplification, "I declare 
this meeting adjourned!" and the 
stunned expressions of the legislators at his unbelievable temerity. There was greatness in that 
little man. Before anyone could 
move or think, he clapped his 
hands — the magnified report was 
like atomic fission — and a smartly uniformed squad moved in on 
us. 

"Take him away," the President declaimed, with a magnificent gesture, and at doubletime 
the squad surrounded me and 
hustled me off the podium. 

The President convoyed us as 
far as the door while the Assembly gathered its wits. His face 
was white with fear, but he whispered: "I can't make it stick, but 




 



it'll take them all afternoon to 
get a ruling from the Chamber 
of Commerce. God bless you, 
Mr. Courtenay." 

And he turned back to face 
them. I do not think Caligula's 
Christians walked more courageously into the arena. 

The guards were the President's 
own, honor men from Brink's 
leadership academy. The lieutenant said never a word to me, 
but I could read the controlled 
disgust on his face as he read the 
slip of paper the President had 
handed him. I knew he didn't 
like what he was ordered to do, 
and I knew he would do it. 

They got me to Anacosta and 
put me on the President's own 
transport. They stayed with me 
and fed me, and one of them 
played cards with me, as the jets 
flared outside the ports and we 
covered territory. All they would 
not do was talk to me. 

It was a long flight, in that 
clumsy old luxury liner that 
•"tradition" gave the President. 
Time had been wasted at the airport, and below us I could see 
the fuzzy band of the terminator 
creeping past. As we came down 
for a landing, it was full dark. 
And the waiting was not yet 
over. The lieutenant left the ship 
alone; he was gone for a long, 
long time. 

When he came back, it was 
midnight. "All right," he said to 

GRAVY PLANET 



me. "A cab's waiting for you 
outside. The driver knows where 

to go." 

I climbed out and stretched. 
"Thanks," I said awkwardly. 

The lieutenant spat neatly on 
the ground between my feet. I 
scrambled out of the way of the 
takeoff. 

THE driver was Mex. I tried 
him on a question and he 
gaped at me; no English. There 
were fifty good reasons why I 
didn't want to go along with him 
without a much better idea of 
what was up. But when I stopped to think of it, I had no 
choice. The lieutenant had followed his orders. I could see his 
active little military mind framing the report that would tip 
someone off to where they could 
find the notorious Connie, Mitchell Courtenay. 

I would be a sitting duck; it 
would depend on whether Taunton or the police got to me first. 

You'd think that the fact that 
the driver was a Mexican would 
have tipped me off. It didn't, 
though. Not until I saw the glimmer of starlight on the massive 
erectile before me did I know I 
was in Arizona, and realize what 
the President had done for me. 

A mixed squad of Pinkertons 
and our own plant protection 
men closed in on me and hustled 
me past the sentry boxes, across 

145 



the cleared land, up "to the rocket 
itself. 

The OIC showed me the Connie crescent he could make with 
thumb and forefinger and said : 
"You're safe now." 

"But I don't want to go to 
Venus!" 

He laughed out loud. 

Hurry up and wait, hurry up 
and wait. The long, dreary flight 
had been a stasis; everything at 
both ends of it had been too frantic with motion over which I had 
no control to permit thought. 
They gave me no chance to think 
here, either. I felt someone grabbing the seat of my pants and 
I was hoisted inside. There I was 
dragged more than led to an 
acceleration hammock, strapped 
in and kft. 

The hammock swung and 
jolted, and twelve titans squatted 
on my chest. Good-by, Kathy; 
good-by, Schocken Tower, Like 
it or not, I was on my way to 
Venus. 

BUT it wasn't really good-by 
to Kathy. It was she herself 
who came to unstrap me when 
the first blast was over. 

I have never seen an expression quite like the one on Kathy 's 
face. It was part darling-I-didthe- most -extravagant - thing - today, and a little bit I'm-notangry- just- terribly -disappointed, 
»nd the corners of her mouth were 



pure you-lousy-son-of-a-bitch. 

She said: "If you'll apologize, 
I'll explain." 

I got out of the hammock and. 
tottered weightlessly, rubbing my 
back. I opened my mouth to 
make a cynical reply. What came 
out was a squeaky, '"Oh, God, 
Kathy!" 

It wasn't a brilliant speech, but 
I didn't have time. Kathy's lips 
and mine were occupied. 

When we stopped for breath, I 
said, "What alkaloids do you put 
i n to the product ? " but it was 
wasted. She wanted to be kissed 
again. I kissed her. 

It was hard work, standing up. 
Every time she moved, we lurched against the wall or drifted off 
the floor entirely. Only a standby 
jet was operating and we wtn 
otherwise beyond the limit of 
weight. 

We sat down. 

"I'm sorry if I guessed wrong," 
I said. "All of a sudden it looked 
as if you and Runstead were 
doublecrossing everybody. Especially me." 

It was only a little kiss this 
time. Just to show. 

I stretched and looked around 
me. "Lovely place you have here. 
The thing was, you see, all at 
once I wanted out. I wanted you 
to have Venus — I'd promised it 
to you — but I wanted out for 
myself. So I ordered the ship 
loaded up, to get it on the way. 



\4t 




 



You were going to be on it, but 
I wasn't." 

"I can't spend my life blaming 
you for jumping to conclusions, 
Mitch," she said gently. "But 
you could tell me what touched 
you off." 

I explained about Runstead's 
lousing up San Diego and Venus 
Project. And about Hester's murder. . 

"Oh, Mitch," she said. "Where 
do I begin? How'd you ever get 
to be star class?" 

"Went to night school," I said. 
"I'm still listening." 

"Well, you should be able to 
figure it out. Sure, we wanted 
space travel. The human race 
needs Venus. But we didn't want 
Fowler S choc ken on Venus. Or 
Mitchell Courtenay, either. Not 
as long as Mitchell Courtenay 
would loot Venus for an extra 
megabuck's billing. There aren't 
too many planets around that 
the race can expand into, Mitch. 
We couldn't have Fowler Schocken's Venus Project succeed." 

"Urn," I said, digesting. "And 
Hester?" 

Kathy shook her head. "You 
figure that one out." 

"You don't know the answer?" 

"I do. It isn't hard." 

I coaxed, but she wouldn't 
play. So I kissed her for a while 
again, until some interfering character with a ship's- officer rosette 
on his shoulder came grinning in. 



"Care to look at the stars, folks?" 
he asked, in a tourist-guide way 
that I detested. It didn't pay to 
pull rank on him, of course; ship's 
officers always act a cut above 
their class and it would have been 
ungraceful, at least, to brace him 
for it. Besides — 

The thought stopped me for a 
moment. I was used to being star 
class by now. It wasn't going to 
be fun, being one of the boys. 
I gave my Conservationist theory 
a quick mental runthrough. No, 
there was nothing in it that indicated that I would have a showdog's chance of being sirred and 
catered to any more. 

Hello, Kathy. Good-by, Schocken Tower. 

WE went up to the forward 
observation port. All the 
faces were strange to me. 

There isn't a window to be 
found on the Moon ships; radareyed, GCA-tentacled, they sacrifice the esthetic but useless 
spectacle of the stars for the 
greater strength of steel. I had 
never seen the stars in space before. 

Outside the port was white 
night. Brilliant stars shining 
against a background of star particles scattered over a dust of 
stars. There wasn't a breadth of 
space the size of my thumbnail 
where there was blackness: it wa3 
all light, all fiery pastels. A rim 



GRAVY PLANET

of fire around the side of the 
port showed the direction of the 
Sun. 

Kathy introduced me around. 
The captain of the ship turned 
out to have a voice I knew; he'd 
spoken to me on the longlines 
phone, and I recalled with no 
pleasure the particular nastiness 
with which I'd reamed him out 
for some small delay. However, 
he showed no rancor. He treated 
me — in fact, all of them treated 
me — like some grand hero of the 
republic from whom nothing 
more could be expected, a pensioned Caesar or Napoleon in 
retirement. 

All at once I realized how 
Jack O'Shca had felt. It was 
great to be great. To have been 
great was something else again. 

Kathy's arm went around me. 
Kathy always reads my mind. 

We turned away from the port. 
"Where's Matt Runstead?" I 
asked. 

"Back in Schockcn Tower, living on wakeup pills, trying to 
untangle the mess. Somebody had 
to stay behind, Mitch. Fortunately, Matt can vote your proxies. 
We didn't, have much time to talk 
i n Washington ; he's going to 
have a lot of questions to ask, 
and nobody around with the answers." 

I stared. "What in the world 
was Runstead doing in Washington?" 



"Getting you off the spot, 
Mitch. After Jack O'Shea 
broke — " 

"After what?" 

"Look, let's take it in order. 
O'Shea broke. He got drunk one 
night too often, and he couldn't 
find a clear spot in his arm for 
the needle, and he picked out the 
wrong girl to break apart in front 
of. They had him sewed up tight. 
All about you, all about me, the 
rocket, everything." 

"Who did?" 

"Your great and good friend, 
B. J. Taunton." Kathy struck a 
cigarette viciously. 

I could read her mind a bit, 
too. Little Jack O'Shea, 60 
pounds of jellied porcelain and 
melted wax, thirty-five inches of 
twisted guts and blubber. There 
had been times in the past weeks 
when I had not liked Jack. I canceled them all, paid in full, when 
I thought of that destructible 
tiny man in the hands of Taunton's anthropoids. 

"Taunton got it all, Mitch," 
Kathy said. "All that mattered, 
anyhow. If Runstead hadn't had 
a tap on Taunton's interrogation 
room, we would have had it right 
then. But he had time to get 
down to Washington and warn 
me and the President — the President is no Conservationist, but 
he's a good man; he can't help 
being born into office — and here 
we are." 



148 




 



The captain interrupted us. 
"Five minutes till we correct. 
Better get back to your hammocks. The correction blasts may 
not be much, but you never 
know." 

Kathy nodded and led me 
away. I plucked the cigarette 
from her lips, took a puff and 
gave it back. "Why, Mitch!" she 
said. 

"I'm reformed," I told her. 
"Kathy, one more question. It 
isn't a nice question." 

She sighed. "The same as between you and Hester." 

I asked, "What was between 
Jack — uh?" 

"You heard me. What was between Jack and me was the same 
as what was between you and 
Hester. All one way. Jack was in 
love with me, maybe. I was too 
damn crazy mad in love with 
you!" 

It seemed like the moment to 
reach out and kiss her again, but 
it must not have been because 
she pushed me away. 

"That's what you're so stupid 
about!" she was saying. "Jack 
wanted me. I didn't want anyone 
but you, not ever. And you never 
troubled to figure it out — never 
knew how much I cared about 
you any more than you knew 
Iidw much Hester cared about 
you. Good Lord, Mitch, how 
blind can you be?" 

"Hester in love with me?" 



"Why else would she commit 
suicide?" Kathy actually stamped her foot, and floated an inch 
above the floor as a result. 

"Well," I said dazedly. 

The sixty-second beeper went 
off. "Hammocks," said Kathy, 
and the tears in her eyes flooded 
out. I put my arm around her. 

"This is a rotten undignified 
busisness," she said. "I have exactly one minute to kiss and 
make up, let you get over your 
question-and- answer period, tell 
you I have a private cabin and 
there're two hammocks in it, and 
get us both fastened in." 

I straightened up fast. "A minute is a long time." 

It didn't take that long. 

XX 

SO we landed. After the wild 
excitement wore off, I felt like 
sitting down and writing a postcard to the little man back in 
Washington: 

"Dear Mr. President, now I 
know what you mean. On special 
occasions they sometimes let me 
in, too. Sincerely, Mitchell (Superfluous) Courtenay." 

We torpedoed the billowy cloud 
layer, roared incandescently down 
in the tangential orbiting approach, minced the final few hundred meters to the landing — and 
I was a bum. 

They were nice enough about 



GRAVY PLANET 



it. They said things like: "No, 
thanks, I can handle it myself," 
and, "Would you mind stepping 
back, Mr. Courtenay?" when 
what they should have said was: 
"Get the hell out of the way." 
And I wondered how long it 
would take before they began to 
put it that way. 

You know what it's like being 
a lost soul? 

It's wandering through a spaceship with busy people rushing 
here and there carrying incomprehensible things. It's people 
talking urgently and efficiently tp 
each other and you understand 
maybe one word in three. It's 
offering a suggestion or trying to 
help and getting a blank stare 
and polite refusal. 

It's Kathy : "Not right now, 
Mitch darling. Why don't you — " 
And her voice trailed off. The 
only appropriate, constructive, 
positive thing I could do was 
drop dead. But nobody said so. 
They would carry me on the 
books, a hero whose brief hour 
of service rendered, when balanced against the long years that 
followed, might or might not 
show a tiny net profit. You never 
could tell with ex-heroes, but you 
can't just gas them . . . 

They were nice about letting 
me come along when fourteen of 
the really important people 
donned spacesuits and set foot 
on Venus. (Note for historians: it 



was completely unceremonious. 
We just went out the lock into 
the lee of the ship, anchored by 
cables. Nobody noticed who of 
the fifteen was first to step out — 
and be yanked by the burning 
wind as far as the cable slack 
would let him, or her.) 

I reached for my wife and the 
wind sent her bobbing on the end 
of her cable out of my grasp. 
Nor did she notice me, a hulking 
and brutish figure in an oversized 
suit, trying to claw my way to 
her along the grab-irons welded 
to the hull. She had eyes only for 
the planet I had given her, the 
orange-lit, sandstorming inferno. 

When they reeled us in and we 
took off our armor, I felt as 
though I had been flailed with 
anchor chains from Easter to 
Christmas. Aching, I turned to 
Kathy. 

She was briskly rubbing her 
surgeon's fingers and conferring 
with somebody named Bartlow in 
words that sounded like these: 
" — then we'll clam the ortnick 
for seven frames and woutch 
green until sembril gills?" 

"Yes," Bartlow said, nodding. 

"Splendid. When the grimps 
quorn with the fibers, Bronson 
can Mine dimethyloxypropyloluene with the waterspouts — " 

I hung around and Kathy finally noticed me with a "Hello, 
dear" and plunged back into the 
important stuff. After a while I 



ISO 




 



wandered off. I got in the way 
of the crews dismantling the 
ship's internal bulkheads. Then 
I got in th( w;sy of the commissary women, then in the way of 
the engineers who were already 
modifying our drive reactor to an 
AC electric pile. When I got in 
the way of the medics who were 
patching up passengers banged 
around in the landing, I took a 
sleepy-pill. My dreams were not 
pleasant. 

"■^"ATHY was crouched over the 
**■ desk when I woke up, pawing 
through stacks of green, pink and 
magenta-covered folders. I yawned. "You been up all night?" 

She said absently, "Yes." 

"Anything I can do to help?" 

"No." 

I rescued one of the folders 
from the floor. Medical Supplies 
Flow Chart, 3d to 5th Colony 
Year, No Local Provisioning Assumed was the heading. The one 
under it covered : Permissible Reproductive Rate, 10th Colony 
Year. 

"That's real planning,'' ] said. 
"Got one covering forecasted lifeexpectancy of third - generation 
colonists born of blue-eyed mothers and left-handed fathers?" 

"Please, Mitch." she said impatiently. "I've got to find tin 
planning schedules for the first 
two months. Naturally wt planned far ahead." 



I dressed and wandered out to 
the chowline. The man ahead of 
me, still wearing the soft padded 
undershoes that went with donning a heat suit, was telling his 
friends about Venus. Not more 
than a tenth of the colonists had 
seen their new planet close up as 
yet: he had a large and fascinated audience. 

"So we located the spot for the 
drilling unit," he said. "We 
moored it to a rock taller than 
me. We started bracing the unit. 
What happens? Plop. The damn 
rock explodes. The wind catche-s 
the drill and you should've seen 
that thing take off. Lucky we 
hadn't cast off the cables to the 
ship yet; it'd still been going. As 
it is, back to the shop. A whole 
day's work shot." 

I listened through the story and 
the questions. 

When he was hurrying off to 
another incomprehensible job. I 
said to him: "WaiC a minute. I 
want to talk to you." 

"Sure, Mr. Courtenay. What 
can I do for you?" 

"Most of this stuff I don't get. 
but I understand a rock drill. 
You're a foreman. Can you put 
me on your crew?" 

"You sure you understand a 
rock drill. Mr. Courtenay? It 
ain't easy to change a carbide tip 
out there in the wind. You got to 
unscrew the camber-flamber and 
wuldge it to the imbrie before 



GRAVY PLANET 



the wind gets it, and that 
takes — " 

There we were again. But this 
time I said: "I can handle it." 

"That's great, Mr. Courtenay. 
I can use another man. Weiss, I 
guess you don't know him, he got 
smacked by a piece of flying 
Something or other, so I'm one 
short." He measured me with his 
eye. "You can use his suit. It 
Wasn't hurt a bit." 

An ugty little chill went 
through me, "What about 
Weiss?" 



A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



"The work-suits are too rigid. 
Something hits you hard, it goes 
clang hard enough to bust your 
eardrums, drive your eyes into 
your head and rupture membranes all through your body. 
But the suit lives through it. 
Well, we go out with a replacement drill at 1730, Port Fourteen 
aft. I'll see you there, Mr. Courtenay." 

I was there and proud of it. 

The drilling crew was big and 
tough — shock troops. They knew 
my name and face, of course, and 
were reserved. As we got into the 
armored work-suits, one of them 
asked apologetically: "Sure you 
can handle this detail, Mr. Courtenay? It's rough out there — " 

I felt my blood pounding with 
anger I shouldn't put into words. 
He was only trying to be helpful. 
There was no use yelling at him 



that I was a man and could 
swing my weight with men, that 
I wasn't just a copysmith and as 
obsolete as the dinosaur. I nodded 
and we stepped out. 

Whoosh! The wind hurled us 
five yards. 

Crack! The cables held. 

Three seconds outside and I 
was fighting for breath. 

"Goddam it!" I gasped, hating my weakness. 

I had forgotten that work -suits 
were wired for sound. The foreman's voice said inside my helmet: "Mr. Courtenay, please keep 
the circuit clear for orders. Guire! 
Slack off! More— hold it! Winters, haul your cable — hold it. 
Mr. Courtenay, work your way 
over to Winters and lay hold." 

Clawing along the storm-swept 
rocks, I reached Winters and 
grabbed the cable. I wondered

dimly if the suit's oxygen supply 
was functioning, if the dryer was 
working. It didn't feel as if they 
were. I could hardly breathe and 
I was soaked with sweat. 

I made a feeble pretense of 
helping Winters, who had the 
build of a granite crag, jockey 
the drill. 

It was like flying a kite — if 
it took five men to fly a kite, and 
if the kite had to be kept at 
ground level, and if the kite perpetually threatened to fly you instead of vice versa. 

After two minutes outside, my 
leg and arm muscles were quivering uncontrollably from the mere 
effort of standing up and keeping 
balanced. It was the tremor of 
flexor pulling against extensor, 
the final fatigue that comes just 
before you let go, forgetting 
everything except that you can't 
keep it up any longer, that you'll 
die if you keep it up for another 
split -second. 

But I hung on for one minute 
more, streaming sweat, sobbing 
air into my lungs and maybe — maybe — helping a little with a 
few extra foot-pounds of heaveho on the cable when it was 
ordered. 

And then I let go, a little less 
than half -conscious, and the wind 
got me. My cable streamed and 
I dangled at the end of it, unable to do anything but listen to 
the voices in my helmet.

"Mr. Courtenay, can you make 
it back to the ship?" 

"He don't answer. He must 
have blacked out." 

"Stinking luck! Almost get the 
drill positioned and then — damn 
the stinking luck! Winters, work 
your way to him and see if he's 
all right." 

"Hell, what can I see? Phone 
them to reel him in is all we can 
d<t" 

"Winchman! Reel in Number 
Five. He's blacked out." 

The cable thrummed and I 
began to scrape along the ground 
to the port. 

And still they talked. "We can 
do it with four if it kills us, men. 
You all game?" 

I heard the ragged chorus of 
yesses as I scraped helplessly over 
the rocks, like a fish on a hook. 

"Shouldn't have let him come 
out at all," one of the crew said. 

SHAME was crowded 'out by 
terror. My suit clanged against 
something and motion stopped. A 
rock, I saw dazedly. A big rock. 
The six ring-bolts to which my 
cable was lashed began to creak 
and strain. 

The fools at the winch, I realized with clear, pure horror, had 
not noticed I was snagged. 

"Stop!" I screamed into the 
helmet. But I did not have a 
phone line through my cable to 
the ship. 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

The "foreman understood instantly. ' ' Winchman! Ease off.' 
He's snagged!" The ring - bolts 
ceased to strain. "Mr. Courtenay, 
can you clear yourself or — or 
should we come to help you?" He 
was only human. There was bitterness in his voice. 

I said rustily: "I can clear 
myself. Thanks." 

But I didn't have to. The big, 
solid rock I had snagged on began to disappear. I don't mean it 
vanished, either with or without 
a thunderclap. Nor did it grow 
transparent and finally become 
invisible. But it began to melt 
from the top, like a ball of string 
unraveling or like an apple being 
peeled for a banquet before it's 
divided into servings — and yet it 
was something like gradually 
turning into powder and blowing 
away. Naturally, it isn't easy to 
describe. 

It was the first Venusian anybody had ever seen.

THEY got me into the ship 
and patched me up. Kathy 
didn't tend me in the hospital — 
she was a surgeon and administrator, and all I had was R.N. 
stuff like bruises and scrapes, but 
plenty of them. 

In three days I was discharged 
with the entire hospital staff suspecting I was psychotic. I could

go them one better. I knew I was. 

Item: I would wash and wash, 
but I never felt clean. 

Item : Suicidal tendencirs. . I 
wanted to go into the nuclear 
reactor room so bad I could taste 
it — and the reactor room was sudden death. 

Item: Claustrophobia. The giant ship wasn't big enough for 
me. I wanted to go outside, into 
that flailing inferno. 

The first night out of the hospital. I sat up in bed waiting and 
waiting for Kathy to come back 
from a staff meeting. I was dogtired, but I didn't dare sleep. I 
had once found myself halfway 
to the reactor room befon 1 
stubbed my toe and woke up. 

She came in, blinking and redeyed at 0245. "Still awake?" she 
yawned at me. plumping onto 
her hammock. 

"Kathy," I said hoarsely. "I'm 
cracking up." 

She looked at me without much 
interest. "Did I ever tell you I 
read a paper on malingering to 
the New York Academy of Medicine?" 

I got up mechanically and 
started for the reactor room, 
grabbed hold of myself, turned 
around and sat down. I told her 
where I had been going. 

She turned nasty. "Not you. I 
know you better than most doctors get to know their patients. I 
also know the exact science of 

15S 



psychiatry and T know that a 
person with your mental configuration could not possibly 
have the symptoms you describe. 
No more than two plus two can 
equal five. I presume you feel 
rejected — which, God knows, you 
have every right to — and are 
consciously trying to hoodwink 
me into thinking you're an interesting case that needs my personal attention." 

''Bitch" I said. 

She was too tired to be angry. 
"If I thought there were the 
smallest possible chance that your 
alleged symptoms are real and 
do spring from your unconscious, 
I'd treat you. But there isn't any 
such chance. I have to conclude 
that you're consciously trying to 
divert "my energy from the job 
I have to do. And under the circumstances that is a despicable 
thing." 

"Bitch," I said again, and got 
up and went out to go to the reactor room. 

My feet moved as though they 
didn't belong to me, and I still 
felt the dirt on me that no soap 
and water or alcohol had been 
able to remove. 

She had meant every word of 
it. She knew" her trade, And it was 
an exact science. She thoroughly 
believed that I couldn't have the 
symptoms I had. If she'd said it 
about somebody else, I would 
have taken her word for it un 


questloningly. Only I had the 
symptoms — 

Or were they symptoms? 

T stopped in »the corridor, 
though my legs wanted to 
go on carrying me into the reactor room. 

AGRONOMY section, a sign over 
a door said. I went in. There was 
no microscope. I looked through 
three more rooms before I found 
one — and a knife that would do 
as a scalpel. 

I meant only to flick a pinpoint 
specimen off the base of my 
thumb, but in my dull intoxication I gashed a minor blood vessel. I found some reasonably 
sterile-looking gauze and wound 
it around my hand. 

I dropped the ragged little 
crumb of meat into the oil-lens 
objective, tapped it to shake free 
the bubbles, levered it into a 
turret chosen at random. There 
was some difficulty in getting the 
light source to function — I 
couldn't make out what I was 
supposed to do with the knob 
marked "polarizer" — but finally 
the stage appeared through the 
eyepiece, bathed in a greenish 
glow. 

I saw : 

Life. 

Clustered around the fabric of 
epidermis that loomed in the eyepiece like a decayed glacier were 
massive chunks of rock, the ran


156 




 



dom dust particles of any atmosphere, the faint accretion 
that no washing will completely 
remove from the human skin. 
They were featureless, irregular 
blobs, most of them. 
But not all. 

Among the dust fragments were 
a dozen or so living things, seaurchin-shaped. Under the flaring 
light of the microscope, they 
seemed spurred to action. The 
spines of one touched the spines 
of another; they flexed and locked. A third blundered into the 
linked pair, and they became a 
Laocoon trio. 

They were no protozoans or 
bacilli of Earth. They glowed ; 
they were utterly alien. And as I 
watched, the trio became six, then 
ten globes locked together. And 
at once the character of the action 
changed: The clustered spheroids 
seemed to beat their flagella in 
unison, driving the mass, like 
eggs trailing from a spawning 
trout, about the field of vision. 
Purposefully, the massed ten ran 
down the other globes and absorbed them, till all were joined. 

That was the second time anyone had seen a Venusian. 

This time, though, it was with 
awareness. 

/ didn't want to go into the 
u n til] room. / didn't want to go 
outside. The Venusian did and 
somehow we had become . . . 
tangled. 



T7"ATHY, with the reflexes of 
a doctor, woke easily when 
I shook her shoulder. She stared 
fixedly at me. 

"Come along," I said. "I want 
to show you something under a 
microscope. And I can't begin to 
tell you what it is because you 
won't believe me until you see 
it." 

"You, with a microscope," she 
said scornfully. 
But she came. 

She looked, blinked, looked 
again. At last, not moving from 
the eyepiece, she said softly : 
"Good God! What in the world 
are they?" 

"Now you prepare a slide from 
my skin," I told her. 

She did, in seconds, and stared 
at it through the microscope. I 
knew the — cells? — were going 
through their outlandish linkup 
behavior. 

"I'm sorry, Mitch," she said 
doubtfully. "Some sort of 
pathogenic organism, causing a 
paranoid configuration — " She 
swallowed. "I didn't mean to be 
unfair." 

"It's all right," Forgiven, she 
was in my arms. "But they're — 
it's not a pathogenic organism. 
It's a Venusian." I told her about 
the rock that vanished. "Some of 
it got carried in with me on the 
suit, I suppose, and got on me, 
or into me — I don't know. Bur / 
teel intelligence. I can sort of

isolate it. now that I can tell 
which is it and which is me. I 
can think of the reactor room in 
two ways. When it's me thinking. 
I know it's deadly. When it's if 
thinking, there's — hunger? Yes, I 
think hunger." 

"It lives on plutonium? No. 
there isn't any on Venus. It has 
to be manufactured." 

I was exploring, thinking of the 
reactor room, what was in it, 
what it looked like, what happened there, and noting my — 
no, its — no, call them the reactions that followed. 

"Energy." I said softly. "Not 
material. It wants to he irradiated." 

And I thought of the outside. 
The wind meant nothing to it. 
The iieat meant mild comfort, 
like air to me or water to a minnow. 

But lightning, free electrons 
and cosmic rays — ah, that was 
reatty living! 

"Energy." I whispered. 

And I thought of the rocks of 
Venus, the rocks that sometimes 
exploded and sometimes unwound 
like baits of string. 

"Love," I said almost inaudibly. "Community. The whole that 
i* greater than the sum of its 
parts. Without hate, without 
fear — " 

Kathy told me later that I 
pitched forward onto my face in 
an old-fashioned faint.

WELL, the grass is still not 
green. But Kathy and I 
walked the hundred yards from 
the ship's skeleton to our hut this 
morning with only oxygen masks 
on. The wind was no more than 
gale force, and it keeps dropping 
in velocity every week. 

Once we found that the Venusians, those incongruous flurries 
of silicate life, were capable of 
something resembling thought, we 
learned what they needed and 
what they could do. 

They needed energy. We gave 
them energy, from the hot -gas 
ends of our giant Hilsch Tubes, 
Maxwell's mythical demon picked 
the hottest molecules from Venus's air and flung them at the 
Venusians. who rejoicingly sucked them dry of high-level heat 
and used the energy so they could 
reproduce even more prolifically 
to absorb still more energy. 

The water roared down from 
the upper atmosphere like an 
ocean falling out of the sky. Now 
we have seas, and the poisoned 
atmosphere is being locked in 
chemical bonds with the soil and 
the rocks. 

We've saved a decade at least, 
the planners say. And the Venusians are doing it for us. They're 
feasting themselves into famine 
on the energy we ripped out of 
the air for them. They'll never 



9ALAXY SCIENCI FICTION 



vanish completely, of course; as 
the amount of available energy 
grows less and less, they'll reduce 
their numbers and we'll have 
more and more of the planet for 
our use, but we'll keep some of 
them alive out of sheer gratitude. 

We cannibalized the ship for 
our huts and shops, leaving only 
the giant structural members that 
we'll be able to work with later — 
melt them down, I suppose, or cut 
them up into useful shapes. It's a 
tidy little community, each couple with a plot of ground and 
furniture that doesn't have to be 
rolled or folded out of the way. 
We're scouting the terrain for 
sources of metals and minerals, 
which won't be senselessly scooped out of the ground, manufactured, used and thrown away; 
they'll be restored to the soil or 
scrupulously collected and reworked. We can't grow anything 
yet, but already we have plans 



for the protection of the rich loam 
we'll create. 

It's a Conservationist world, 
all right, and it makes sense . . . 
you take what you need from the 
planet and put it back when 
you're through. On Earth, that's 
the worst kind of radicalism, of 
course. Being a copysmith, trained in semantics, I keep wondering 
how I could get my concepts so 
tangled that I mistook the epitome of conservatism for wildeyed sabotage, when I know now 
that any kind of purposeless destruction is almost physical anguish for a Conservationist. 

You don't have to be a prophet 
to see how Venus is developing 
into a self-sustaining economy. 
Kathy figured it out: By the time 
our first-born is of age, Fowler 
Schocken's commercials will have 
come true.
