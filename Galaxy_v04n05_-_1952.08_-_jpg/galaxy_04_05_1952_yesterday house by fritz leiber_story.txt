yesterday house by fritz leiber

THE narrow cove was quiet as 
the face of an expectant 
child, yet so near the ruffled Atlantic that the last push of wind 1 
carried the Anftie O. its full 
length. The man in gray flannels 
and sweatshirt let the sail come 
crumpling down and hurried past 
its white folds at a gait made 
comically awkward by his cramped muscles. Slowly the rocky 



ledge came nearer. Slowly the 
blue V inscribed on the cove's 
surface by the sloop's prow died. 
Sloop and'ledge kissed so gently 
that he hardly had to reach out 
his hand. 

He scrambled ashore, dipping 
a sneaker in the icy water, and 
threw the line around a boulder. 
Unkinking himself, he looked 
back through the cove's high and 
rocky mouth at the gray-green

scattering of islands and the 
faint dark line that was the 
coast of Maine. He almost laughed in satisfaction at having disregarded vague warnings and 
done the thing every man yearns 
to do once in his lifetime — gone 
to the farthest island out. 

He must have looked longer 
than he realized, because by the 
time he dropped his gaze the cove 
was again as glassy as if the 
Annie 0. had always been there. 
And the splotches made by his 
sneaker on the rock had faded 
in the hot Sun. There was something very unusual about the 
quietness of this place. As if 
time, elsewhere hurrying frantically, paused here to rest. As 
if all changes were erased on this 
one bit of Earth. 

The man's . lean, melancholy 
face crinkled into a grin at the 
banal fancy. He turned his back 
on his new friend, the little green 
sloop, without one thought for his 
nets and specimen bottles, and 
set out to explore. The ground 
rose steeply at first and the oaks 
were close, but after a little way 
things went downhill and the 
leaves thinned and he came out 
on more rocks — and realized that 
he hadn't quite gone to the farthest one out. 

JOINED to this island by a 
rocky spine, which at the 
present low tide would have been 



dry but for the spray, was another green, high island that the 
first had masked from him all the 
while he had been sailing. He felt 
a thrill of discovery, just as he'd 
wondered back in the woods 
whether his might not be the 
first human feet to kick through 
the underbrush. After all, there 
were thousands of these islands. 

Then he was dropping down 
the rocks, his lanky limbs now 
moving smoothly enough. 

To the landward_ side of the 
spine, the water was fairly still. 
It even began with another deep 
cove, in which he glimpsed the 
spiny spheres of sea urchins. But 
from seaward the waves chopped 
in, sprinkling his trousers to the 
knees and making him wince 
pleasurably at the thought of 
what vast wings of spray and 
towers of solid water must crash 
up from here in a storm. 

*He crossed the rocks at a trot, 
ran up a short grassy slope, raced 
through a fringe of trees — and 
came straight up against an eightfoot fence of heavy mesh topped 
with barbed wire and backed at 
a short distance with high, heavy 
shrubbery. 

Without pausing for surprise — ■ 
in fact, in his holiday mood, using 
surprise as a goad — he jumped 
for the branch of a» oak whose 
trunk touched the fence, scorning 
the easier lower branch on the 
other side of the tree. Then he 



62 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



drew himself up. worked his way 
to some higher branches that 
crossed the fence, and dropped 
down inside. 

Suddenly cautious, he gently 
parted the shrubbery and, before 
the first surprise could really sink 
in, had another. 

A closely mown lawn dotted 
with more shrubbery ran up to 
a snug white Cape Cod cottage. 
The single strand of a radio 
aerial stretched the length of the 
roof. Parked on a neat gravel 
driveway that crossed just in 
front of the cottage was a short, 
square-lined touring car that he 
recognized from remembered pictures as an ancient Essex. The 
whole scene had about it the same 
odd quietness as the cove. 

Then, with the air of a clockwork toy coming to life, the white 
door opened and an elderly woman came out, dressed in a long, 
lace-edged dress and wide, lacy 
hat. She climbed into the driver's 
seat of the Essex, sitting there 
very stiff and tall. The motor began to chug bravely, gravel skittered, and the car rolled off 
between the trees. 

The door of the house opened 
again and a slim girl emerged. 
She wore a white silk dress that 
fell straight from square neckline to hip-height waistline, making the skirt seem very short. Her 
dark hair was bound with a white 
bandeau so that it curved close 



to her cheeks. A dark necklace 
dangled against the white of the 
dress. A newspaper was tucked 
under her arm. 

She crossed the driveway and 
tossed the pape'r down on a rattan table between three rattan 
chairs and stood watching a 
squirrel zigzag across the lawn. 

npHE man stepped through the 
wall of shrubbery, called, 
"hello!" and walked toward her. 

She whirled around and stared 
at him as still as if her heart had 
stopped beating. Then she darted behind the table and waited 
for him there. Granting the surprise of his appearance, her alarm 
seemed not so much excessive as 
eerie. As if, the man thought, he 
were not an ordinary stranger, 
but a visitor from another planet. 

Approaching closer, he saw 
that she was trembling and that 
her breath was coming in rapid, 
irregular gasps. Yet the slim, 
sweet, patrician face that stared 
into his had an underlying expression of expectancy that reminded 
him of the cove. She couldn't 
have been more than eighteen. 

He stopped short of the table. 
Before he could speak, she stammered out, "Are you he?" 

"What do you mean?" he asked, smiling puzzledly. 

"The one who sends me the 
little boxes." 

"I was out sailing and I hap

1 didn't dream that anyone lived 
on this island, or even came here." 

"No one ever does come here." 
she re plied. Her manner had 
changed, becoming at once more 
wary and less agitated, though 
still eerily curious. 

"It startled me tremendously 
to find this place," he blundered 
on. "Especially the road and the 
car. Why. this island can't be 
more than a quarter of a mile 
wid< ." 

"The road goes down to the 
wharf," she explained, "and up 
to the top of the island, where my 
aunts have a tree-house." 

He tore his mind away from the 
picture of a woman dressed like 
Queen Mary clambering up a 
tree. "Was that your aunt I saw 
driving off?" 

"One of them. The other's 
taken the motorboat in for supplies." She looked at him doubtfully. "I'm not sure they'll like 
it if they find someone here." 

"There are just the three of 
you?" he cut in quickly, looking 
down the empty road that vanished among the oaks. 

She nodded. 

"I su ppose you go in to the 
mainland with your aunts quite 

She shook her head. 
"It must go t | retty dull for 
you." 

"Not very," she said, smiling. 



"My aunts bring me the pupers 
and other things. Even movies. 
We've got a projector. My favorite stars are Antonio Morino 
and Alice Terry. I like her bettef 
even than Clara Bow." 

He looked at her hard for a 
moment. "I suppose you read a 
lot?" 

She nodded. "Fitzgerald's my 
favorite author." She started 
around the tabic, hesitated, suddenly grew shy. "Would you like 
some lemonade ?" 

HE'D noticed the dewed silver 
pitcher, but only now realized his thirst. Yet when she handed him a glass, he held it untested 
and said awkwardly, "1 haven't 
introduced myself. I'm Jack 
Barry." 

She stared at his outstretched 
right hand, slowly extendi d her 
own toward it. shook it Up and 
down exactly once, then quickly 
dropped it. 

He chuckled and gulped some 
lemonade. "I'm a biology student. Been working at Wood's 
Hole the first part of the summer. 
But now I'm here to do research 
in marine ecology — that's sort 
of sea-life patterns — of the inshore islands. Under the direction of Professor Kesscrich. You 
know about him. of course?" 

She shook her head. 

"Probably the greatest living 
biologist," he was proud to in



 



form her. "Human physiology as 
well. Tremendous geneticist. In 
a class with Carlson and Jacques 
Loeb. Martin Kesserich — he lives 
over there at town. I'm staying 
with him. You ought to have 
heard of him." He grinned. "Matter of fact, I'd never have met you 
if it hadn't been for Mrs. Kesserich." 

The girl looked puzzled. 

Jack explained, "The old boy's 
been off to Europe on some conferences, won't be back for a 
couple days more. But I was to 
get started anyhow. When I went 
out this morning Mrs. Kesserich — she's a drab sort of person — 
said to me. 'Don't try to sail to 
the farther islands.' So, of course, 
I had to. By the way. you still 
haven't told me your name." 

"Mary Alice Pope," she said, 
speaking slowly and with an odd 
wonder, as if she were saying it 
for the first time. 

"You're pretty shy, aren't 
you?" 

"How would I know?" 

The question stopped Jack. He 
couldn't think of anything to say 
to this strangely attractive girl 
dressed almost like a "flapper." 

"Will you sit down?" she asto <1 
him gravely. 

The rattan chair siglr-rd under 
his weight. He made another effort to talk. "I'll bet you'll be 
glad when summer's over." 

"Why?" 



"So you'll be able to go bark to 
the mainland." 

"But I never go to the mainland." 

"You mean you stay out here 
all winter?" h< «sk<-d incredulously, his mind filled with a vision of snow and frozen spray 
and great gray waves. 

"Oh, yes. We get all cut Mipplies on hand before winter. My 
aunts are very capable. They 
don't always wear long laee dresses. And now I help them." 

"But that's impossible!" he 
said with sudden sympathetic 
anger. "You can't be shut off 
this way from people your own 
age !" 

"You're the first one I ever 
met." She hesitated. "I never saw 
a boy or a man before, exctpt in 
movies." 

"You're joking!" 

"No, it's true." 

"But why are they doing it to 
you?" he demanded, leaning forward. "Why are they inflicting 
this loneliness on you. Mary?*' 

OHE seemed to have gained 
k — ' poise from his loss of it. "I 
don't know why. I'm to find out 
soon. But actually I'm not ion. ly. 
May I tell you a secret?" She 
touched his hand, this time with 
only -the faintest trembling. 
"Every night the loneliness gathers in around me — you're right 
about that. But lhcn every rhorn

ing new life comes to me in a 
little box." 

"What's that?" he said sharply. 

"Sometimes there's a poem in 
the box, sometimes a book, or 
pictures, or flowers, or a ring, 
but always a note. Next to the 
notes I like the poems best. My 
favorite is the one by Matthew 
Arnold that ends, 

*Ah, love, let us be true 
To one another! for the world, 

which seems 
To lie before like a land of 

So various, so beautiful, so new, 
Heth really ' neither joy, nor love, 

nor light, 
Nor certitude — ' " 

"Wait a minute," he interrupted. "Who sends you these 
boxes?" 

"I don't know." 

"Cut how are the notes signed?" 

"They're wonderful notes," she 
said. "So wise, so gay, so tender, 
you'd imagine them being written 
by John Barry more or Lindbergh." 

"Yes, but how are they signed?" 

She hesitated. "Never anything but 'Your Lover.' " 

"And so when you first saw me, 
you thought — " He began, then 
stopped because she was blushing. 

"How long have you been getting them?" 

"Ever since I can remember. 
I have two closets of the boxes. 
The new ones arc either by my 
bed when I wo!;? or at my place 

66 



at breakfast." 

"But how does this — person 
get these boxes to you out here? 
Does he give them to your aunts 
and do they put them there?" 
"I'm not sure." 

"But how cam they get them 
in\vinter?" 

"I don't know." 
"Look here," he said, pouring 
himself more lemonade, "how 
long is it since you've been to 
the mainland?" 

"Almost eighteen years. My 
aunts tell me I was born there 
in the middle of the war." 

"What war?" he asked startledly, spilling some lemonade. 

"The World War, of course. 
What's the matter?" 

Jack Barr was staring down at 
the spilled lemonade and feeling 
a kind of terror he'd never experienced in his waking life. 
Nothing around him had changed. He could still feel the same 
hot Sun on his shoulders, the 
same icy glass in his hand, scent 
the same lemon-acid odor in his 
nostrils. He could still hear the 
faint chop-chop of the waves. 

And yet everything had changed, gone dark and dizzy as a 
landscape glimpsed just before a 
faint. All the little false notes had 
come to a sudden focus. For 
the lemonade had spilled on the 
headline of the newspaper the 
girl had tossed down, and 
the headline read : 


 



HITLER IN NEW DEFIANCE 

Under the big black banner 
of that head swam smaller ones: 

Foes of Machado Rio! in Havana 
Big NRA Parade Planned 
Balbo Spe«V> in New York 

SUDDENLY he felt a surge of 
relief. He had noticed that 
the paper was yellow and brittleedged. 

"Why are you so interested in 
old newspapers?" he asked. 

"I wouldn't call day-beforeyesterday's paper old," the girl 
objected, pointins at the dateline: 
July 20, 1933. 

"You're trying to joke," Jack 
fold her. 

"No, I'm not.'* 

"But it's 1953." 

"Now it's you who are joking," 

"But the paper's yellow." 

"The paper's always yellow." 

He laughed uneasily. "Well, 
if you actually think it's 1933, 
perhaps you're to be envied," he 
said, with a sardonic humor he 
didn't quite feel. "Then you can't 
know anything about the Second 
World War, or television, or the 
V-2s, or Bikini bathing suits, or 
the atomic bomb, or — '* 

"Stop!" She had sprung up 
and retreated around her chair, 
white-faced. "I don*t like what 
you're saying." 



"But—" 

"No, please! Jokes that may 

be quite harmless on the mainland sound different here." 

"I'm really not joking," he 
said after a moment. 

She grew quitfe frantic at that. 
"I can show you all last week's 
papers! I can show you magazines and other things. I can 
prove it!" 

She started toward the house. 
He followed. He felt his heart begin to pound. 

At the white door she paused, 
looking worriedly down the road. 
Jack thought he could hear the 
faint chug of a motorboat. She 
pushed open the door and he 
followed her inside. The smallwindowed room was dark after 
the sunlight. Jack got an impression of solid old furniture, a fireplace with brass andirons. 

"Flash!" croaked a gritty voice. 
"After their disastrous break day 
before yesterday, stocks are recovering. Leading issues. . ." 

Jack realized that he had started and had involuntarily put his 
arm around the girl's shoulders. 
At the same time he noticed that 
the voice was coming from the 
curved brown trumpet of an oldfashioned radio loudspeaker. 

The girl didn't pull away from 
him. He turned toward her. Although her gray eyes were on 
him, her attention had gone elsewhere. 



YESTERDAY HOUSE

"I can hear the car. They're 
coming back. They won't like it 
that you're here." 

"All right they won't like it/' 

Her agitation grew. "No. you 
must go." 

"I'll come back tomorrow," he 
heard himself saying. 

"Flash! It looks as if the World 
Economic Conference may soon 
adjourn, mouthing jeers at old 
Uncle Sam who is generally referred to as Uncle Shylock." 

Jack felt a numbness on his 
neck. The room seemed to be 
darkening, the girl growing stranger still. 

"You must go before they see 
you." 

"Flash! Wiley Post has just 
completed his solo circuit of the 
Globe, after a record-breaking 
flight of 7 days, 18 hours and 45 
minutes. Asked how he felt after 
the energy-draining feat, Post 
quipped. . ." 

TTF- was halfway across the 
lawn before he realized the 
terror into which the grating 
radio voice had thrown him. 

He leaped for the branch overhanging the fence, vaulted up 
with the risky help of a foot on 
the barbed top. A surprised squirrel, lacking time to make its 
escape up the trunk, sprang to 
the ground ahead of him. With 
terrible suddenness, two steeljawed semicircles clanked togeth


er just over the squirrel's head. 
Jack landed with one foot to 
either side of the sprung trap, 
while the squirrel darted off with 
a squeak. 

Jack plunged down the slope to 
the rocky spine and ran across 
it, spray from the rising waves 
spattering him to the waist. Panting now, he stumbled up into the 
oaks and undergrowth of the first 
island, fought his way through tt, 
finally reached the silent cove. He 
loosed the line of the Annie O., 
dragged it as near to the cove's 
mouth as he could, plunged kneedeep in freezing water to give it 
a final shove, scrambled aboard, 
snatched up the boathook and 
punched at the rocks. 

As soon as the Annie O. was 
nosing out of the cove into the 
cross waves, he yanked up the 
sail. The freshening wind filled 
it and sent the sloop heeling over, 
with inches of white water over 
the lee rail, and plunging ahead. 

For a long while, Jack was satisfied to think of nothing but the 
wind and the waves and the sail 
and speed and danger, to have 
all his attention taken up balancing one against the other, so that, 
he wouldn't have to ask himself 
what year it was and whether 
time was an illusion, and wonder 
about flappers and hidden traps. 

When he finally looked back 
at the island, he was amazed to 
see how tiny it had grown, as 



4* 



GALAXY SCIENCE FtCTfON 



distant as the mainland. 

Then he saw a gray motorboat 
astern. He watched it as it slowly overtook him. It was built like 
a lifeboat, with a sturdy low cabin in the bow and wheel amidship. 
Whoever was at the wheel had 
long gray hair that whipped in 
the wind. The longer he looked, 
the surer he was that it was a 
woman wearing ■ a lace dress. 
Something that stuck up inches 
over the cabin flashed darkly beside her. Only when she lifted it 
to the roof of the cabin did it 
occur to him that it might be a 
rifle. 

But just then the motorboat 
swung around in a turn that sent 
waves drenching over it, and 
headed back toward the island. 
He watched it for a minute in 
wonder, then his attention was 
jolted by an angry hail. 

Three fishing smacks, also 
headed toward town, were about 
to cross his bow. He came around 
into the wind and waited with 
shaking sail, watching a man in 
a lumpy sweater shake a fist at 
him. Then he turned and gratefully followed the dark, wide, 
fanlike sterns and age- yellowed 
sails. 

II 

riTHE exterior of Martin Kesserich's home — a weathered 
white cube with narrow, sharp


paned windows, topped by a cupola — was nothing like its lavish 
interior. 

In much the same way, Mrs. 
Kesserich clashed with the darkly gleaming furniture, persian 
rugs and bronze vases around 
her. Her shapeless black form, 
poised awkwardly on the edge of 
a huge sofa, made Jack think of 
a cow that had strayed into the 
drawing room. He wondered 
again how a man like Kesserich 
had come to marry such a creature. 

Yet when she lifted up her little 
eyes from the shadows, he had 
the uneasy feeling that she knew 
a great deal about him. The eyes 
were still those of a domestic 
animal, but of a wise one that 
has been watching the house a 
long, long while from the barnyard. 

He asked abruptly, "Do you 
know anything of a girl around 
here named Mary Alice Pope?" 

The silence lasted so long that 
he began to think she'd gone into 
some bovine trance. Then, without a word, she got up and went' 
over to a tall cabinet. Feeling on 
a«ledge behind it for a key, she 
opened a panel, opened a cardboard box inside it, took somethink from the box and handed 
him a photograph. He held it up 
to the failing light and sucked in 
his breath with surprise. 

It was a picture of the girl he'd 



YESTERDAY HOUSE 



met that afternoon. Same flatbosomed dress — flowered rather 
than white — no bandeau, same 
beads. Same proud, demure expression, perhaps a bit happier. 

"That is Mary Alice Pope," 
Mis. Kesserich said in a strangely flat voice. "She was Martin's 
fiancee. She was killed in a railway accident in 1933." 

The small sound of the cabinet 
door closing brought Jack back 
to reality. He realized that he no 
longer had the photograph. 
Against the gloom by the cabinet, 
Mrs. Kesserich's white face 
looked at him with what seemed 
a malicious eagerness. 

"Sit down," she said, "and I'll 
tell you about it." 

V/ithout a thought as to why 
she hadn't asked him a single 
question — he was much too dazed 
for that — he obeyed. Mrs. Kesserich resumed her position on 
the ed^e of the sofa. 

"You must understand, Mr. 
Barr. that Mary Alice Pope was 
the one love of Martin's life. He 
is a man of very deep and strong 
feelings, yet as you probably 
know, anything but kindly or 
demonstrative. Even when he 
first came here from Hungary 
with his older sisters Hani and 
Hilda, there was a cloak of loneliness about him — or rather about 
the three of them. 

"Hani and Hilda were athletic 
outdoor women, yet fiercely 

TO 
 





YESTERDAY HOUSE 



proud— I don't imagine they ever 
spoke to anyone in America except as to a servant — and with a 
seething distaste for all men except Martin. They showered all 
their devotion on him. So of 
course, though Martin didn't 
realize it, they were consumed 
with jealousy when he fell in 
love with Mary Alice Pope. 
They'd thought that since he'd 
reached forty without marrying, 
he was safe. 

"Mary Alice came from a purebred, or as a biologist would say, 
inbred British stock. She was 
very young, but very sweet, and 
up to a point very wise. She 
sensed Hani and Hilda's feelings 
right away and did 'everything 
she could to win them over. For 
instance, though she was afraid 
of horses, she took up horseback 
riding, because that was Hani 
and Hilda's favorite pastime. 
Naturally, Mnrtin knew nothing 
of her fear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. 
But — and here is where Mary's 
wisdom fell short — her brave 
gesture did not pneify them: it 
only increased their hatred. 

"Except for his research, Martin was blind to everything but 
his love. It was a beautiful and 
yet frightening passion. e*n insane cherishing as narrow and 
intense as his sisters' hatred.*' 



7t 



1W7TTH a start. Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich tilling him all this. 

She went on, "Martin's love 
directed his every move. He was 
building a home for himself and 
Mary, and in his mind he was 
building; a wonderful future for 
them as well — not vaguely, if you 
know Martin, but year by year, 
month by month. This winter, 
he'd plan, they would visit 
Buenos Aires, next summer they 
would sail down the inland passage and he would teach Mary 
Hungarian for their trip to BudaPesth the year after, where he 
would occupy a chair at the 
university for a few months . . . 
and so on. Finally the time for 
their marriage drew near. Martin had been away. His research 
was keeping him very busy — " 

Jack broke in with, "Wasn't 
that about the time he did his 
definitive work on growth and 
fertilization?" 

Mrs. Kesserich nodded with 
Solemn appreciation in the gathering darkness. "But now he was 
coming home, his work done. It 
was early evening, very chilly, 
but Hani and Hilda felt they had 
to ride down to the station to 
meet their brother. And although 
she dreaded it. Mafy rode with 
them, for she knew how delighted 
he would be at her cantering to 
the puffing train Rnd his running 
up to lift hor down from the 



saddle to welcome him home. 

"Of course there was Martin** 
luggage to be considered, so the 
station wagon had to be sent 
down for that." She looked 
defiantly at Jack. "I drove the 
station wagon. I was Martin's 
laboratory assistant." 

She paused. "It was almost 
dark, but there was still a white 
cold line of sky to the west. Hani 
and Hilda, with Mary between 
them, were waiting on their 
horses at the top of the hill that 
led down to the station. The 
train had whistled and its headlight was graying the gravel of 
the crossing. 

"Suddenly Mary's horse 
squealed and plunged down the 
hill. Hani and Hilda followed — 
to try to catch her, they "said, but 
they didn't manage that, only 
kept her horse from veering off. 
Mary never screamed, but as 
her horse reared on the tracks. I 
saw her face in the headlight's 
glare. 

"Martin must have guessed, or 
at least feared what had happened, for he was out of the 
train and running along the 
track before it stopped. -In fact, 
he was the first to kneel down 
beside Mary — I mean, what had 
been Mary — and was holding 
her all bloody and shattered in 
his arms." 

A door slammed. There were 
steps in the hall. Mrs. Kesserich 



71 




 



stiffened and was silent. Jack 
tamed. 

The blur of a face hung in the 
doorway to the hall — a seemingly young, sensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. 
Then there was a click and the 
lights flared up and Jack saw 
the close-cropped gray hair and 
the lines around the eyes and 
nostrils, while the sensitive 
mouth grew sardonic. Yet the 
handsomeness stayed, and somehow the youth, too, or at least 
a tremendous inner vibrancy. 

"Hello, Barr," Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife. 

The great biologist had come 
home. 

Ill 

"AH, yes, and Jamieson had a 
feeble paper on what he 
called individualization in marine 
worms. Barr. have you ever 
thought much about the larger 
aspects of the problem of individuality?" 

Jack jumped slightly. He had 
let his thoughts wander very far. 

"Not especially, sir," he mumbled. 

The house was still. A few 
minutes after the professor's arrival, Mrs. Kesserich had gone off 
with an anxious glance at Jack. 
He knew why and wished he 
could reassure her that he would 
not mention their conversation to 



the professoi 

Kesserich had spexit perhaps a 
half hour briefing him on th 
more important papers delivere 
at the conferences. Then, aimer 
as if it were a teacher's trick t 
show up a pupil's inattention, he 
had suddenly posed this question about individuality. 

"You know what I mean, of 
course," Kesserich pressed. "Th" 
factors that make you you. and 
me me." 

"Heredity and environment." 
Jack parroted like a freshman. 

Kesserich nodded. "Suppose — ■ 
this is just speculation — that we 
could control heredity and environment. Then we could recreate the same individual at 
will." 

Jack felt a shiver go througl 
him. "To get exactly the same 
pattern of hereditary traits. 
That'd be far beyond us." 

"What about identical twins?" 
Kesserich pointed out. "And 
then there's parthenogenesis to 
be considered. One might produce 
a duplicate of the mother without the intervention of the male." 
Although his voice had grown 
more idly speculative, Kesserich 
seemed to Jack to be smiling 
secretly. "There are many ex 
amples in the lower animal forms, 
to say nothing of the technique 
by which Loeb caused a sea 
urchin to reproduce with no mor 
stimulus than a salt solution." 



YESTERDAY HOUSE 



Jack felt the hair rising on his 
neck. "Even then you wouldn't 
get exactly the same pattern of 
hereditary traits." 

"Not if the parent were of 
very pure stock ? Not i f there 
wt r< Morne special technique for 
selecting ova that would reproduce all the mother's traits?" 

"But environment would 
change things," Jack objected. 
"The duplicate would be bound 
to develop differently." 

"Is environment so important? 
Newman tells about a pair of 
identical twins separated from 
birth, unaware of each other's 
existence. They met by accident when they were twenty-one. 
Each was a telephone repairman. Each had a wife the same 
age. Each had a baby son. And 
each had a fox terrier called 
'Trixie.' That's without trying to 
make environments simitar. But 
suppose you did try. Suppose you 
saw to it that each of them had 
exactly the same experiences at 
the same times . . .'* 

For a moment it seemed to 
Jack that the room was dimming 
and wavering, becoming a dark 
pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's sphinxlike face. 

"Well, we've escaped quite far 
enough from Jamieson's marine 
worms," the biologist said, all 
brisk again. He said it as if Jack 
were the one who had led the 



conversation down wild and unprofitable channels. "Let's get on 
to your project. I want to talk it 
over now, because I won't have 
any tiVne for it tomorrow." 

Jack looked at him blankly. 

"Tomorrow I must attend to a 
very important matter," the biologist explained. 

IV 

Tt/T©RNING sunlight brighten J-™* ed the colors of the wax 
flowers under glass on the high 
bureau that always seemed to 
emit the faint odor of old hair 
combings. Jack pulled back the 
diamond-patterned quilt and 
blinked the sleep from his eyes. 
He expected his mind to be busy 
wondering about Kesserich and 
his wife — things said and half 
said last night — but found instead 
that his thoughts swung instantly 
to Mary Alice Pope, as if to a 
farthest islanfl in a world of 
people. 

Downstairs, the house was 
empty. After a long look at the 
cabinet — he felt behind it, but 
the key was gone — he hurried 
down to the waterfront. He 
stopped only for a bowl of chowder and. as an afterthought, to 
buy half a dozen newspapers. 

The sea was bright, the brisk 
wind just right for the Annie O. 
There was eagerness in the way 
it smacked the sail and in the 



74 




 



creak of the mast. And when he 
reached the cove, it was no longer 
still, but nervous with faint ripples, as if time had finally begun 
to stir. 

After the same struggle with 
the underbrush, he came out on 
the rocky spine and passed the 
cove of the sea urchins. The 
spiny creatures struck an uncomfortable chord in his memory. 

This time he climbed the second island cautiously, scraping 
the innocent -seeming ground 
ahead of him intently with a 
boathook he'd brought along for 
the purpose. He was only a few 
yards from the fence when he 
saw Mary Alice Pope standing 
behind it. 

He hadn't realized that his 
heart would begin to pound or 
that, at the same time, a shiver 
of almost supernatural dixad 
would go through him. 

The girl eyed him with an uneasy hostility and immediately 
began to speak in a hushed, hurried voice. "You muit go away 
at once and never come back. 
You're a wicked man, but I 
don't want you to be hurt. I've 
been watching for you all morning." 

He tossed the newspapers over 
the fence. "You don't have to 
read them now." he told her. 
"Just look at the datelines and 
a few of the headlines." 

When she finally lifted her 



eyes to his again, she was trembling. She tried unsuccessfully to 
speak. 

"Li&ten to me," he said. 
"You've been the victim of a 
scheme to make you believe you 
were born around 1916 instead of 
1933, and that it's 1933 now instead of 1951. I'm not sure why 
it's been done, though I think I 
know who you really are." 

"But," the girl faltered, "my 
aunts tell me it's 1933." 

"They would." 

"And there are the papers . . . 
the magazines . . . the radio." 

"The papers are old ones. The 
radio's faked — some sort of recording. I could show you if I 
could get at it." 

"These papers might be faked,'* 
she said, pointing to where she'd 
let them drop on the ground. 

"They're new," he said. "Only 
old papers get yellow." 

"But why would they do it to 
me? Why? 1 ' 

"Come with me to the mainland, Mary. That'll set you 
straight quicker than anything." 

"I couldn't," she said, drawing back. "He's coming tonight." 

"He?" 

"The man who sends me the 
boxes . . . and my life." 

Jack shivered. When he spoke, 
his voice was rough and quick. 
"A life that's completely a lie, 
that's cut you off from the world. 
C(Jme with me, Mary." 



YESTERDAY HOUSE 



75 



CHE looked up at him wonderingly. For perhaps ten seconds the silence held and the 
spell of her eerie sweetness deepened. 

"I love you. Mary," Jack said 
sof Jy. 

She took a step back. 

"Really, Mary, I do.* 

She shook her head. "I don't 
know what's true. Go away." 

"Mary," he pleaded, "read the 
papers I've given you. Think 
things through. I'll wait for you 
here." 

"Vou can't. My aunts would 
find you." 

"Then I'll go away and come 
back. About sunset. Will you 
give me an answer?" 

She looked at him. Suddenly 
she whirled around. He. too, 
fceard the chuff of the Essex. 
"They'll find us," she said. "And 
if they find you. I don't know 
what they'll do. Quick, run!" 
And she darted off herself, only 
to turn back to scramble for the 
papers. 

"But will you give me an answer?" lie pressed. 

She looked frantically up from 
the papers. "I don't know. You 
i*ustn't risk coming back." 

"I will, no matter what you 
say." 

"I can't promise. Please go." 
"Just one question," he begged. 
"What are your aunts' names?" 
"Wtni and Hilda," she told 



him, and then she was gone. The 
hedge shook where she'd darted 
through. 

Jack hesitated, then started for 
the cove. He thought for a moment of staying on the island, but 
decided against it. He could probably conceal himself successfully, 
but whoever found his boat 
would have him at a disadvantage. Besides, there were things 
he must try to find out on the 
mainland. 

As he entered the oaks, his 
spine tightened for a moment, as 
if someone were Watching him. 
He hurried to the rippling cove, 
wasted no time getting the Annie 
O. underway. With the wind still 
in the west, he knew it would be 
a hard sail . He'd need half a 
dozen tucks to reach the mainland. 

When he was about a quarter 
of a mile out from the cove, there 
was a sharp smack beside him. 
He jerked around, heard a distant crack and saw a foot-long 
splinter of fresh wood dangling 
from the edge of the sloop's cockpit, about a foot from his head. 

He felt his skin tighten. He 
was the bull's-eye of a great 
watery target. All the air between 
him and the island was tainted 
with menace. 

Water splashed a yard from 
the side. There was another distant crack. He lay on his back 
in the cockpit, steering by the 



76 




 



sail, taking advantage of what 
little cover there was. 

There were several more cracks. 
After the second, there was a hole 
in the sail. 

Finally Jack looked back. The 
island was more than a mile 
astern. He anxiously scanned the 
sea ahead for craft. There were 
none. Then he settled down to 
nurse more speed from the sloop 
and wait for the motorboat. 

But it didn't come out to follow him. 

V 

CAME as yesterday. Mrs. Kesserich was sitting on the edge 
of the couch in the living room, 
yet from the first Jack was aware 
of a great change. Something had 
filled the domestic animal witli 
grief and fury. 

"Where's Dr. Kesserich?" he 
asked. 

"Not here!" 

"Mrs. Kesserich." he said, 
dropping down beside her, "you 
were telling me something yesterday when we were interrupted." 

She looked at him. "You have 
found the girl?" she almost 
shouted. 

"Yes," Jack was surprised into 
answering. 

A look of slyness t*ame into 
Mrs. Kesserich's bovine face. 
"Then I'll tell you everything, I 
can now. 

"When Marfin found Mary 



dying, he didn't go to pieces. You 
know how controlled he can be 
when he chooses. He lifted 
Mary's body as if the crowd and 
the railway men weren't there, 
and carried it to the station wagon. Hani and Hilda were sitting 
on their horses nearby. He gave 
them one look. It was as if he had 
said, 'Murderers!' 

"He told me to drive home as 
fast as I dared, but when I got 
there, he stayed sitting by Mary 
in the back. I knew he must have 
given up what hope he had for 
her life, or else she was dead already. I looked at him. In the 
domelight. his face had the most 
deadly and proud expression I've 
ever seen on a man. I worshiped 
him, you know, though he had 
never shown me one ounce of 
feeling. So I was completely unprepared for the naked appeal in 
his voice. 

"Yet all he said at First was, 
'Will you do something for me?* 
I told him, 'Surely,' and as we 
carried Mary in, he told me the 
rest. He wanted me to be the " 
mother of Mary's child." 

Jack stared at her blankly. 

Mrs. Kesserich nodded. "He 
wanted to remove an ovum from 
Mary's 1 body and nurture it in 
mine, so that Mary, in a way, 
could live on." 

"But that's impossible!" Jack 
objected. "The technique is being tried now on cattle, I know. 



YESTERDAY HOUSE 



77 



so that a prize heifer can have 
several calves a year, all nurtured 
in 'scrub heifers,' as they're 
called. But no one's ever dreamed 
of trying it on human beings!'* 

Tlfl'RS. Kesserich looked at him 
■J-™*- contemptously. "Martin had 
mastered the technique twenty 
years ago. He was willing to take 
the chance. And so was I — partly 
because he fired my scientific 
imagination and reverence, but 
mostly because he said he would 
marry me. He barred the doors. 
We worked swiftly. As far as 
anyone was concerned, Martin, 
in a wild fit of grief, had locked 
himself up for several hours to 
mourn over the body of his 
fiancee. 

"Within a month we were married, and I finally gave birth to 
the child." 

Jack shook his head. "You gave 
birth to your own child." 

She smiled bitterly. "No, it was 
Mary's. Martin did not keep his 
tthole bargain with me — I was 
nothing more than his 'scrub wife' 
in every way." 

"You think you gave birth to 
Mary's child." 

Mrs. Kesserich turned on Jack 
in anger. "I've been wounded by 
him, day in and day out, for 
years, but I've never failed to 
recognize his genius. Besides, 
you've seen the girl, haven't 
you?" 



Jack had to nod. What confounded him most was that, 
granting the near-impossible 
physiological feat Mrs. Kesserich 
had described, the girl should 
look so much like the mother. 
Mothers and daughters don't 
look that much alike; only identical twins did. With a thrill of 
fear, he remembered Kesserich's 
casual words: "... parthenogenesis . . . pure stock . . . special 
techniques . . ." 

"Very well," he forced himself 
to say, "granting that the child 
was Mary's and Martin's — " 

"No? Mary's alone!" 

Jack suppressed a shudder. He 
continued quickly, "What became of the child?" 

Mrs. Kesserich lowered her 
head. "The day it was born, it 
was taken away from me. After 
that, I never saw Hilda and 
Hani, either." 

"You mean." Jack asked, "that 
Martin sent them away to bring 
up the child?" 

Mrs. Kesserich turned away. 
"Yes." 

Jack asked incredulously, "He 
trusted the child with the two 
people he suspected of having 
caused the mother's death?" 

"Once when I was his assistant," Mrs. Kesserich said softly, 
"I carelessly broke some laboratory glassware. He kept me up all 
night building a new setup, 
though I'm rather poor at work



 



ing with glass and usually get 
burned. Bringing up the child 
was his sisters' punishment." 

"And they went to that house 
on the farthest island? I suppose 
it was the house he'd been building for Mary and himself.'* 

"Yes." 

"And they were to bring up 
the child as his daughter?" 

Mrs. Kesserich started up, but 
when she spoke it was as if she 
had to force out each word. "As 
his wife — as soon as she was 
grown." 

"How can you know that?" 
Jack asked shakily. 

The rising wind rattled the 
windowpane. 

"Because today — eighteen years 
after — Martin broke all of his 
promise to me. He told me he 
was leaving me/' 

VI 

VJT/HITE waves shooting up 
™* like dancing ghosts in the 
Moon -sketched, spray-swept dark 
were Jack's first beacon of the 
island and brought a sense of 
physical danger, breaking the 
trancelike yet frantic mood he 
had felt ever since he had spoken 
with Mrs. Kesserich. 

Coming around farther into the 
wind, he scudded past the end of 
the island into the choppy sea on 
the landward side. A little later 
he let down the reefed sail in the 



cove of the sea urchins, where the 
water was barely moving, although the air was shaken by the 
pounding of the surf on the spine 
between the two islands. 

After making fast, he paused 
a moment for a scrap of cloud to 
pass the moon. The thought of 
the spiny creatures in the black 
fathoms under the Annie O. sent 
an odd quiver of terror through 
him. 

The Moon came out and he 
started across the glistening rocks 
of the spine. But he had forgotten 
the rising tide. Midway, a wave 
clamped around his ankles, tried 
to carry him off, almost made 
him drop the heavy object he 
was carrying. Sprawling and 
drenched, he clung to the rough 
rock until the surge was past. 

Making it finally up to the 
fence, he snipped a wide gate 
with the wire-cutters. 

The windows of the house were 
alight. Hardly aware of his 
shivering, he crossed the lawn, 
slipping from one clump of shrubbery to another, until he reached 
one just across the drive from the 
doorway. At that moment he 
heard the approaching chuff of 
the Essex, the door of the cottage 
opened, and Mary Alice Pope 
stepped out, closely followed by 
Hani or Hilda. 

Jack shrank close to the shrubbery. Mary looked pale and 
blank-faced, as if she had re


YESTERDAY HOUSE 



79 



treated within herself. He was 
acutely conscious of the inadequacy of his screen as the ghostly 
headlights of the Essex began to 
probe through the leaves. 

But then he sensed that something more was about to happen 
than just the car arriving. It was 
a change in the expression of the 
face behind Mary that gave him 
the cue — a widening and sidewise flickering of the cold eyes, 
the puckered lips thinning into a 
cruel smile. 

The Essex shifted into second 
and. without any warning, accelerated. Simultaneously, the woman behind Mary gave her a 
violent shove. But at almost exactly the same instant, Jack ran. 
lU caught Mary as she sprawled 
toward the gravel, and lunged 



ahead without checking. The 
Essex bore down upon them, a 
square-snouted, roaring monster. 
It swerved viciously, missed 
them by inches, threw up gravel 
in a skid, and rocked to a stop, 
stalled. 

THE first, incredulous voice 
that broke the pulsing silence. 
Jack recognized as Martin Kesserich's. It came from the car, 
which was slewed around so that 
it almost faced Jack and Mary. 

"Hani, you tried to kill her! 
You and Hilda tried to kill her 
again!" 

The woman slumped over the 
wheel slowly lifted her head. In 
th< indistinct light, she looked 
the twin of the woman behind 
Jack and Mary. 




"Did you really think we 
wouldn't?" she asked in a voice 
that spat with passion. "Did you 
actually believe that Hilda and I 
would serve this eighteen years' 
penance just to watch you go off 
with her?" She began to laugh 
wildly. "You've never understood 
your sisters at all!" 

Suddenly she broke off. stiffly 
stepped down from the car. Lifting her skirts a little, she strode 
past Jack and Mary. 

Martin Kesserich followed her. 
In passing, he said. "Thanks, 
Barr." It occurred to Jack that 
Kesserich made no more question 
of his appearance on the island 
than of his presence in the laboratory. Like Mrs. Kesserich, the 
great biologist took him for 
granted. 



Kesserich stopped a few feet 
short of Hani and Hilda. Without shrinking from him. the sisters drew closer together. They 
looked like two gaunt hawks. 

"But you waited eighteen 
years," he said. "You could have 
killed her at any time, yet you 
chose to throw away so much of 
your lives just to have this moment." 

"How do you know we didn't 
like waiting eighteen years?" 
Hani answered him. "Why 
shouldn't we Want to make as 
strong an impression on you as 
anyone? And as for throwing our 
lives away, that was your doing. 
Oh, Martin, you'll never know 
anything about how your sisters 
feel!" 

He raised his hands baffU-dty. 




YESTERDAY HOUSE 



M 



"Even assuming that you hate 
me — " at the word "hate" both 
Hani and Hilda laughed softly— 
"and that you were prepared to 
strike at both my love and my 
work, still, that you should have 
Waited . . ." 

Hnni and Hilda said nothing. 

Kesserich shrugged. "Very 
well." he said in a voice that had 
lost all its tension. "You've 
wasted a third of a lifetime looking forward to an irrational revenge. And you've failed. That 
should be sufficient punishment." 

Very slowly, he turned around 
and for the first time looked at 
Mary. His face was clearly revealed by the twin beams from 
the stalled car. 

Jack grew cold. He fought 
against accepting the feelings of 
wonder, of poignant triumph, of 
love, of renewed youth he saw entering the face in the headlights. 
But most of all he fought against 
the sense that Martin Kesserich 
was successfully drawing them all 
back into the past, to 1933 and 
another accident. There was a 
distant hoot and Jack shook. For 
a moment he had thought it a 
railway whistle and not a ship's 
horn. 

The biologist said tenderly, 
"Come, Mary." 

JACK'S trembling arm Tightened a trifle on Mary's waist. 
He could feel her trembling. 



"Come, Mary." Kesserich repeated. 

Stilt she didn't reply. 

Jack wet his lips. "Mary isn't 
going with you, Professor," he 
said. 

"Quiet, Barr," Kesserich ordered absently. "Mary, it is necessary that you and I leave the 
island at once. Please come." 

"But Mary isn't coming," Jack 
repeated. 

Kesserich looked at him for the 
first time. "I'm grateful to you for 
the unusual sense of loyalty — 
or whatever motive it may have 
been — that led you to follow me 
out here tonight. And of course 
I'm profoundly grateful to you 
for saving Mary's life. But I 
must ask you not to interfere 
further in a matter which you 
can't possibly understand." 

He turned to Mary. "I know 
how shocked and frightened you 
must feel. Living two lives and 
then having to face two deaths- — 
it must be more terrible than anyone can realize. I expected this 
meeting to take place under very 
different circumstances. I wanted 
to explain everything to you very 
naturally and gently, like the 
messages I've sent you every day 
of your second life. Unfortunately, that can't be. 

You and I must leave the 
island fight now.'* 

Mary stared at him, then 
turned wonderingly toward Jack, 



82 




 



who felt his heart begin to pound 
warmly. 

"You still don't understand 
what I'm trying to tell you, 
Professor," he said, boldly now. 
"Mary is not going with you. 
You've deceived her all her life. 
You've taken a fantastic amount 
of pains to bring her up under 
the delusion that she is Mary 
Alice Pope, who died in — " 

"She is Mary Alice Pope," 
Kesserich thundered at him. He 
advanced toward them swiftly. 
"Mary darling, you're confused, 
but you must realize who you are 
and who I am and the relationship between us." 

"Keep away," Jack warned, 
swinging Mary half behind him. 
"Mary doesn't love you. She 
can't marry you, at any rate. 
How could she, when you're her 
father?" 

"Barr!" 

"Keep off!" Jack shot out the 
flat of his hand and Kesserich 
went staggering backward. "I've 
talked with your wife — your wife 
on the mainland. She told me 
the whole thing." 

T/"ESSERICH seemed about to 
rush forward again, then controlled himself. "You've got 
everything wrong. You hardly deserve to be told, but under the 
circumstances I have no choice. 
Mary is not my daughter. To be 
precise, she has no father at all. 



Do you remember the work that 
Jacques Loeb did with sea urchins?" 

Jack frowned angrily. "You 
mean what we were talking about 
last night?" 

"Exactly. Loeb was able to 
cause the egg of a sea urchin to 
develop normally without union 
with a male germ cell. I have 
done the same thing with a human being. This girl is Mary 
Alice Pope. She has exactly the 
same heredity. She has had exactly the same life, so far as it 
could be reconstructed. She's 
heard and read the same things 
at exactly the same times. There 
have been the old newspapers, 
the books, even the old recorded 
radio programs. Hani and Hilda 
have had their daily instructions, 
to the letter. She's retraced the 
same time-trail." 

"Rot !" Jack interrupted. "I 
"don't for a moment believe what 
you say about her birth. She's 
Mary's daughter — or the daughter of your wife on the mainland. 
And as for retracing the same 
time-trail, that's senile self-delusion. Mary Alice Pope had a 
normal life. This girl has been 
brought up in cruel imprisonment 
by two insane, vindictive old 
women. In your own frustrated 
desire, you've pretended to yourself that you've recreated the girl 
you lost. You haven't. You 
couldn't. Nobody could — the

great Martin Kesscrich or anyone 
else I" 

Kesserich, his features working, shifted his point of attack. 
"Who are you, Mary?" 

"Don't answer him," Jack said. 
"He's trying to confuse you." 

"Who are you?" Kesserich insisted. 

"Mary Alice Pope," she said 
rapidly in a breathy whisper before Jack could speak again. 

"And when were you born?" 
Kesserich pressed on. 

"You've been tricked all your 
life about that," Jack warned. 

But already the girl was saying, 
"In 1916." 

"And who am I then?" Kesserich demanded eagerly. "Who 
am I?" 




'HE girl swayed. She brushed 
her head with her hand. 



"It's so strange," she said, 
with a dreamy, almost laughing 
throb in her voice that turned 
Jack's heart cold. "I'm sure I've 
never seen you before in my life, 
and yet it's as if I'd known you 
forever. As if you were closer to 
me than — " 

"Stop it!" Jack shouted at Kesserich. "Mary loves me. She loves 
me because I've shown her the 
lie her life has been, and because 
she's coupling away with me now. 
Aren't you, Mary?" 

He swung her around so that 
her blank face was inches from 



his own. "It's me you love, isn't 
it, Mary?" 

She blinked doubtfully. 

At that moment Kesserich 
charged at them, went sprawling 
as Jack's fist shot out. Jack 
swept up Mary and ran with her 
across the lawn. Behind him he 
heard an agonized cry — Kesserich's — and cruel, mounting 
laughter from Hani and Hilda. 

Once through the ragged doorway in the fence, he made his 
way more slowly, gasping. Out 
of the shelter of the trees, the 
wind tore at them and the ocean 
roared. Moonlight glistened, now 
on the spine of black wet rocks, 
now on the foaming surf. 

Jack realized that the girl in 
his arms was speaking rapidly, 
disjointedly, but he couldn't 
quite make out the sense of the 
words and then they were lost in 
the crash of the surf. She struggled, but he told himself that it 
was only because she was afraid 
of the menacing waters^ 

He pushed recklessly into the 
breaking surf T raced gasping 
across the middle of the spine as 
the rocks uncovered, sprang to 
the higher ones as the next wave 
crashed behind, showering them 
with spray. His chest burning 
with exertion, he carried the girl 
the few remaining yards to where 
the Annie O. was tossing. A sudden great gust of wind almost did 
what the waves had failed to do, 



M 




 



but he kept his footing and lowered the girl into the boat, then 
jumped in after. 

She stared at him wildly. 
"What's that?" 

He, too, had caught the faint 
shout. Looking back along the 
spine just as the Moon came clear 
again, he saw white spray rise 
and fall — and then the figure of 
Kesserich stumbling through it. 

"Mary, wait for me!" 

The figure was halfway across 
win 11 it lurched, started forward 
again, then was jerked back as 
if something had caught its 
ankle. Out of the darkness, the 
next wave sent a line of white at 
it neck-high, crashed. 

Jack hesitated, but another 
great gust of wind tore at the 
half-raised sail, and it was all 
he could do to keep the sloop 
from capsizing and head her into 
the wind again. 

Mary was tugging at his shoulder. "You mmrt help him," she 
was saying. "He's caught in the 
rocks." 

H,e heard a voice crying. 
Screaming crazily above the surf: 
"Ah, love, let us be true 
To one another! for the world — " 

The sloop rocked. Jack had it 
finally headed into the wind. He 
looked around for Mary. 

She had jumped out and was 
hurrying back, scrambling across 
the rocks toward the dark, strug


gling figure that even as he 
watched was once more engulfed 
in the surf. 

Letting go the lines. Jack 
sprang toward the stern of the 
sloop. 

But just then another giant 
blow came, struck the sail like 
a great fist of air, and sent the 
boom slashing at the back of his 
head. 

His last recollection was being 
toppled out onto the rocks and 
wondering how he could cling to 
them while unconscious.

T^HE little cove was once again 
as quiet as time's heart. Once 
again the Annie O. was a sloop 
embedded in a min or. Once again 
the rocks were warm underfoot. 

Jack Barr lifted his fiercely 
aching head and looked at the 
distant line of the mainland, as 
tiny and yet as clear as something viewed through the wrong 
end of a telescope. He was very 
tired. Searching the island, in 
his present shaky condition, had 
taken all the strength out of him. 

He looked at the peacefully 
rippling sea outside the cove and 
thought of what a churning pot 
it had been during the storm. He 
thought wonderingly of his rescue — a man wedged unconscious 
between two rock teeth, kept 
somehow from being washed

away by the merest chance. 

He thought of Mrs. Kesserich 
sitting alone in her house, scanning the newspapers that had 
nothing to tell. 

He thought of the empty 
island behind him and the vanished motorboat. 

He wondered if the sea had 
pulled down Martin Kesserich 
and Mary Alice Pope. He wondered if only Hani and Hilda had 
sailed away. 

He winced, remembering what 



he hr.d done to Martin and Mary 
by his blundering infatuation. In 
his way, he told himself, he had 
been as bad as the two old 
women. 

He thought of death, and of 
time, and of love that defies 
them. 

He stepped lhvpingly into the 
Annie O. to set sail — and realized 
that philosophy is only for the 
unhappy. 

Mary was asleep in the stern.
