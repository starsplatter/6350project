WHEN you write about 
yourself it somehow always gets to sound like 
statistics. Let's make it statistics, then. I'm twenty-four 
— be twenty-five, probably, by the 
time you read this; have been 
reading science fiction since 1939 
and writing it since 1949; did all 
the usual things like holding an 
odd assortment of jobs ranging 
from bartender to real estate salesman, before I settled down to writing as a full-time and much-loved 
vocation; went to college (William 
and Mary in Virginia) where I 
learned how to play a fair to 
middling game of poker; like

THIS month's cover marks a 
real first in the science fiction world. We're not speaking of the fact that it's a new Malcolm Smith photo-cover — a popular trend that Madge introduced to 
the field some two years ago. The 
innovation lies in its background — 
for the first time an actual photograph of interstellar space is incorporated into a science fiction cover. 
The photo used by Smith is that of 
the Spiral Nebula in Andromeda, 
certainly one of the most impressive astronomical studies. We'd 
also like to call special attention to 
the space ships — they're not the 
conventional "painted" variety. 
Malcolm put his home workshop to 
use and carefully fashioned them 
out of balsa wood, a long, tedious 
job, but it resulted in a very realistic cover after the model ships 
had been photographed. Oh, yes, 
the red ball at the lower right was 
an orange, which Smith promptly 
ate after the photograph was made. 
(We don't know if it was a California or Florida product, but it added 
just the right flavor Smith wanted!) 

WE'D certainly like to get 
your reaction to this new 
type of photo-cover, and in the 
meantime we've got Malcolm working on a number of others, also 
utilizing actual astronomical backgrounds. So drop us a line — and if 



you have any unique ideas of what 
you'd like to see in a photo-cover 
of this "type, tell us that too. 

SPEAKING of space ships and 
such remands us of a conversation we had a while back with 
the director of one of the nation's 
prominent planetariums. It was interesting to get this learned gentleman's, opinions on the possibility 
of space flight. (We'll withhold 
his name because we feel sure he'll 
have to reverse his opinion in the 
near future!) He contended that 
space flight — even to the Moon — • 
was not only highly improbable but 
practically impossible. His reason 
for feeling this way was because, 
as he put it, any such ship would 
require so much of a fuel storage 
capacity (and thrust material, 
such as sand to be expelled beyond 
the Earth's atmosphere) that no 
room would be left for crew and 
equipment — not to mention the fuel 
necessary for a return trip. 

THE fuel problem for an initial 
takeoff from Earth's surface, 
is, of course, a staggering one, and 
in this respect our scientist friend 
is quite within reasonable grounds 
for his skepticism. However, to 
flatly state that space flight is 
out of the question because of this 
is being somewhat less than farsighted. It is much the same as 



4 



looking at a stalled automobile with 
a run-down battery and stating: 
"This car will not run." Of course it 
will not run, unless you give it an 
outside assist — a push. Today space 
flight is resolving into a similar 
situation. The point is, we have 
at our possible command just such 
a push. — The highly touted space 
station. True, this is still in the 
theoretical stage (simply because 
one does not as yet exist) but many 
top-flight scientists have considered the project as a practical solution, and are, indeed, working on 
it. 

SO we offer to our skeptical astronomer the logical sequence 
of events a space station would introduce. It will be no problem to 
send ships from Earth to a space 
station where they can be refueled 
to resume their journey to Luna. 
Once the Moon has been reached a 
much more elaborate takeoff point 
is at hand — to reach Mars or Venus. And since the Moon's gravitational attraction is roughly only 
one-sixth that of Earth the acceleration necessary to escape its pull 
would present no critical problem. 
Too, much larger ships, with great 
storage capacity, could be built on 
the Moon for such an interplanetary venture. In essence, the Moon 
would be a super space station . . . 
A science fiction dream? A few 
years ago, yes. But not today. It 
may be a natural tendency to be 
conservative, as our planetarium 
director appears to be, hut in this 
swiftly moving technological age 
conservatism (and its brother skepticism) are being left swiftly behind. There are doubtless many 



more people in the same skeptical 
boat in regard to space flight — 
than are in our optimistic canoe. 
But one of these days that canoe is 
going to be parked on the Moon's 
surface — and then watch the mad 
scramble to book passage! 

SPEAKING of things to come, 
next month brings us a . new 
novel by top-favorite Geoff St. 
Reynard. (Remember his ARMAGEDDON — 1970 last year?) 
Geoff's new novel is entitled THE 
BUTTONED SKY, and it's a story you don't want to miss. Dne way 
you can be sure of not missing it 
■ — and future issues which will have 
some pleasant surprises — is to subscribe. If you'll turn to page 162 
you'll find , out how easy it is — and 
economical too! — so what are you 
waiting for? See you next month,

knots outside the city hall, met in 
the park and littered its walks 
with newspapers and magazines as 
they gobbled up editorial comment 
at a furious rate, slipped with dark 
of night through back alleys and 
planned things with furious futility. Center City's finest knew 
when to make themselves scarce: 
their uniforms stood for everything 
objectionable at this time and they 
might be subjected to clubs, stones, 
taunts, threats, leers — and knives. 

But Center City, like most communities in United North America, 
had survived the Riots before and 
would survive them again. On past 
performances, the damage could be 
estimated, too. Two-hundred fifty-seven plate glass windows 
would be broken, three-hundred 
twelve limbs fractured. Several 
thousand people would be treated 
for minor bruises and abrasions, 
Center City would receive half 
that many damage suits. The list 
had been drawn clearly and accurately; it hardly ever deviated. 

And Center City would meet its 
quota. With a demonstration of 
reluctance, of course. The healthy 
approved way to get over social 
trauma once every seven-hundred 
eighty days.

"Shut it off, Kit. Kit, please." 

The telio blared in a cheaply 
feminine voice, "Oh, it's a long 
way to nowhere, forever. And 



your honey's not coming back, 
never, never, never ..." A wailing trumpet represented flight. 

"They'll exploit anything, Kit." 

"It's just a song." 

"Turn it off, please." 

Christopher Temple turned off 
the telio, smiling. "They'll announce the names in ten minutes," 
he said, and felt the corners of his 
mouth draw taut. 

"Tell me again, Kit," Stephanie 
pleaded. "How old are you?" 

"You know I'm twenty-six." 

"Twenty-six. Yes, twenty-six, 
so if they don't call you this time, 
you'll be safe. Safe, I can hardly 
believe it." 

"Nine minutes," said Temple in 
the darkness. Stephanie had drawn 
the blinds earlier, had dialed for 
sound-proofing. The screaming in 
the streets came to them as not 
the faintest whisper. But the song 
which became briefly, masachistically popular every two years and 
two months had spoiled their feeling of seclusion. 

"Tell me again, Kit." 

"What." 

"You know what." 

He let her come to him, let her 
hug him fiercely and whimper 
against his chest. He remained 
passive although it hurt, occasionally stroking her hair. He could 
not assert himself for another— 
he looked at his strap chrono — ■ 
for another eight minutes. He 



VOYAGE Tt 

might regret it, if he did, for a 
lifetime. 

"Tell me, Kit." 

"I'll marry you, Steffy. In eight 
minutes, less than eight minutes, 
I'll go down and get the license. 
We'll marry as soon as it's legal." 

"This is the last time they have 
a chance for you. I mean, they 
won't change the law?" 

Temple shook his head. "They 
don't have to. They meet their 
quota this way." 

"I'm scared." 

"You and everyone else in 
North America, Steffy." 

She was trembling against him. 
"It's cold for June." 

"It's warm in here." He kissed 
her moist eyes, her nose, her lips. 

"Oh God, Kit. Five minutes." 

"Five minutes to freedom," 
he said jauntily. He did not feel 
that way at all. Apprehension 
clutched at his chest with tight, 
painful fingers, almost making it 
difficult for him to breathe. 

"Turn it on, Kit." 

TTE dialed the telio in time to 
* see the announcer's insincere 
smile. Smile seventeen, Kit thought 
wryly. Patriotic sacrifice. 

"Every seven-hundred eighty 
days," said the announcer, "twohundred of Center City's young 
men are selected to serve their 
country for an indeterminate period regulated rigidly by a rotation 



ETERNITY 9 

system." 

"Liar!" Stephanie cried. "No 
one ever comes back. It's been 
thirty years since the first group 
and not one of them ..." 

"Shh," Temple raised a finger 
to his lips. 

"This is the thirteenth call since 
the inception of what is popularly 
referred to as the Nowhere Journey," said the announcer. "Obviously, the two hundred young men 
from Center City and the thousands from all over this hemisphere 
do not in reality embark on a 
Journey to Nowhere. That is quite 
meaningless." 

"Hooray for him," Temple 
laughed. 

"I wish he'd get on with it." 

"No, ladies and gentlemen, we 
use the word Nowhere merely because we are not aware of the ultimate destination. Security reasons make it impossible to ... " 

"Yes, yes," said Stephanie impatiently. "Go on." 

"... therefore, the Nowhere 
Journey. With a maximum security lid on the whole project, we 
don't even know why our men are 
sent, or by what means. We know 
only that they go somewhere and 
not nowhere, bravely and not fearfully, for a purpose vital to the 
security of this nation and not to 
slake the thirst of a chessman of 
regiments and divisions. 

"If Center City's contribution 



10 



IMAGINATION 



helps keep our country strong, 
Center City is naturally obligated 

"No one ever said it isn't our 
duty," Stephanie argued, as if the 
announcer could indeed hear her. 
"We only wish we knew something 
about it — and we wish it weren't 
forever." 

"It isn't forever," Temple reminded her. "Not officially." 

"Officially, my foot. If they 
never return, they never return. 
If there's a rotation system on paper, but it's never used, that's not 
a rotation system at all. Kit, it's 
forever." 

"... to thank the following 
sponsors for relinquishing their 
time ..." 

"No one would want to sponsor 
that," Temple whispered cheerfully. 

"Kit," said Stephanie, "I — I 
suddenly have a hunch we have 
nothing to worry about. They 
missed you all along and they'll 
miss you this time, too. The last 
time, and then you'll be too old. 
That's funny, too old at twentysix. But we'll be free, Kit. Free." 

"He's starting," Temple told 
her. 

A large drum filled the entire 
telio screen. It rotated slowly, 
from bottom to top. In twenty 
seconds, the letter A appeared, 
followed by about a dozen names. 
Abercrombie, Harold. Abner, Eu


gene. Adams, Gerald. Sorrow in 
the Abercrombie household. Despair for the Abners. Black horror for Adams. 

The drum rotated. 

"They're up to F, Kit." 

Fabian, Gregory G . . . 

Names circled the drum slowly, 
like viscous alphabet soup. Meaningless, unless you happened to 
know them. 

"Kit, I knew Thomas Mulvany." 

N, 0, P . . . 

"It's hot in here." 

"I thought you were cold." 

"I'm suffocating now." 

R, S . . . 

"T!" Stephanie shrieked as the 
names 'began to float slowly up 
from the bottom of the drum. 

Tabor, Tebbets, Teddley . . . 

Temple's mouth felt dry as a 
ball of cotton. Stephanie laughed 
nervously. Now — or never. 
Never? 

Now. 

Stephanie whimpered despairing
ly. 

TEMPLE, CHRISTOPHER. 

CCCJORRY I'm late, Mr. Jones." 

"Hardly, Mr. Smith. 
Hardly. Three minutes late." 

"I've come in response to your 
ad." 

"I know. You look old." 
"I am over twenty-six. Do you 
mind?" 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY

"Not if you don't, Mr. Smith. " 
Let me look at you. Umm, you 
seem the right height, the right 
build." 

"I meet the specifications exactly." 

"Good, Mr. Smith. And your 
price." 

"No haggling," said Smith. "I 
have a price which must be met." 

"Your price, Mr. Smith?" 

"Ten million dollars." 

The man called Jones coughed 
nervously. "That's high." 

"Very. Take it or leave it." 

"In cash?" 

"Definitely. Small unmarked 
bills." 

"You'd need a moving van!" 

"Then I'll get one." 

"Ten million dollars," said Jones, 
"is quite a price. Admittedly, I 
haven't dealt in this sort of traffic 
before, but — " 

"But nothing. Were your name 
Jones, really and truly Jones, I 
might ask less." 

"Sir?" 

"You are Jones exactly as much 
as I am Smith." 

"Sir?" Jones gasped again. 

Smith coughed discreetly. "But 
I have one advantage. I know you. 
You don't know me, Mr. Arkalion." 

"Eh? Eh?" 

"Arkalion. The North American Carpet King. Right?" 
"How did you know?" the man 



whose name was not Jones but Arkalion asked the man whose name 
was not Smith but might as well 
have been. 

"When I saw your ad," said notSmith, "I said to myself, 'now here 
must be a very rich, influential 
man.' It only remained for me to 
study a series of photographs 
readily obtainable — I have a fine 
memory for that, Mr. Arkalion — 
and here you are; here is Arkalion the Carpet King." 

"What will you do with the ten 
million dollars?" demanded Arkalion, not minding the loss nearly so 
much as the ultimate disposition 
of his fortune. 

"Why, what does anyone do with 
ten million dollars? Treasure it. 
Invest it. Spend it." 

"I mean, what will you do with 
it if you are going in place of 
my — " Arkalion bit his tongue. 

"Your son, were you saying, Mr. 
Arkalion? Alaric Arkalion the 
Third. Did you know that I was 
able to boil my list of men down 
to thirty when I studied their family ties?" 

"Brilliant, Mr. Smith. Alaric is 
so young—" 

"Aren't they all? Twenty-one 
to twenty-six. Who was it who 
once said something about the 
flower of our young manhood?" 

"Shakespeare?" said Mr. Arkalion realizing that most quotes 
of lasting importance came from 



IMAGINATION 



the bard. 

"Sophocles," said Smith. "But, 
no matter. I will take young Alaric's place for ten million dollars." 

Motives always troubled Mr. 
Arkalion, and thus he pursued 
what might have been a dangerous 
conversation. "You'll never get 
a chance to spend it on the Nowhere Journey." 

"Let me worry about that." 

"No one ever returns." 

"My worry, not yours." 

"It is forever — as if you dropped out of existence. Alaric is so 
young." 

"I have always gambled, Mr. 
Arkalion. If I do not return in 
five years, you are to put the money in a trust fund for certain designated individuals, said fund to be 
terminated the moment I return. 
If I come back within the five 
years, you are merely to give the 
money over to me. Is that clear?" 

"Yes." 

"I'll want it in writing, of 
course." 

"Of course. A plastic surgeon 
is due here in about ten minutes, 
Mr. Smith, and we can get on with 
. . . But if I don't know your name, 
how can I put it in writing?" 

Smith smiled. "I changed my 
name to v Smith for the occasion. 
Perfectly legal. My name is John 
X. Smith— now." 

"That's where you're wrong," 
said Mr. Arkalion as the plastic 



surgeon entered. "Your name is 
Alaric Arkalion III — now." 

The plastic surgeon skittered 
around Smith, examining him minutely with the casual expertness 
that comes with experience. 

"Have to shorten the cheek 
bones." 

"For ten million dollars," said 
Smith, "you can take the damned 
things out altogether and hang 
them on your wall." 

SOPHIA Androvna Petrovitch 
made her way downtown 
through the bustle of tired workers and the occasional sprinkling 
of Comrades. She crushed her 
ersatz cigarette underfoot at number 616 Stalin Avenue, paused for 
the space of five heartbeats at the 
door, went inside. 

"What do you want?" The man 
at the desk was myopic but bullnecked. 

Sophia showed her party card. 

"Oh, Comrade. Still, you are a 
woman." 

"You're terribly observant, Comrade," said Sophia coldly. "I am 
here to volunteer." 

"But a woman." 

"There is nothing in the law 
which says a woman cannot volunteer." 

"We don't make women volunteer." 

"I mean really volunteer, of her 
own free will." 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



13 



"Her — own — free will?" The 
bull-necked man removed his spectacles, scratched his balding head 
with the ear-pieces. "You mean 
volunteer without — " 

"Without coercion. I want to 
volunteer. I am here to volunteer. 
I want to sign on for the next Stalintrek." 

"Stalintrek, a woman?" 

"That is what I said." 

"We don't force women to volunteer." The man scratched some 
more. 

"Oh, really," said Sophia. "This 
is 1992, not mid-century, Comrade. Did not Premier Stalin say, 
'Woman was created to share the 
glorious destiny of Mother Russia 
with her mate?' " Sophia created 
the quote randomly. 

"Yes, if -Stalin said — " 

"He did." 

"Still, I do not recall—" 

"What?" Sophia cried. "Stalin 
dead these thirty-nine years and 
you don't recall his speeches? 
What is your name, Comrade?" 

"Please, Comrade. Now .that 
you remind me, I remember." 

"What is your name." 

"Here, I will give you the volunteer papers to sign. If you 
pass the exams, you will embark 
on the next Stalintrek, though why 
a beautiful young woman like 
you — " 

"Shut your mouth and hand me 
those papers." 



There, sitting behind that desk, 
was precisely why. Why should 
she, Sophia Androvna Petrovitch, 
wish to volunteer for the Stalintrek? Better to ask why a bird 
flies south in the winter, one day 
ahead of the first icy gale. Or why 
a lemming plunges recklessly into 
the sea with his multitudes of fellows, if, indeed, the venture were 
to turn out grimly. 

But there, behind that desk, 
was part of the reason. The Comrade. The bright sharp Comrade, with his depth of reasoning, 
his fountain of gushing emotions, his worldliness. Pjooey! 

It was as if she had been in a 
oocoon all her life, stifled, starved, 
the cottony inner lining choking 
her whenever she opened her 
mouth, the leathery outer covering 
restricting her when she tried to 
move. No one had ever returned 
from the Stalintrek. She then had 
to assume no one would. Including Sophia AndrOvna Petrovitch. 
But then, there was nothing she 
would miss, nothing to which she 
particularly wanted to return. Not 
the stark, foul streets of Stalingrad, not the workers with their 
vapid faces or the Comrades with 
their cautious, sweating, trembling, 
fearful non-decisions, not the higher echelon of Comrades, more 
frightened but showing it less, who 
would love the beauty of her 
breasts and loins but not herself 



14 



IMAGINATION 



for you never love anything but the 
Stalinimage and Mother Russia 
herself, not those terrified martinet-marionettes who would love 
the parts of her if she permitted 
but not her or any other person 
for that matter. 

Wrong with the Stalintrek was 
its name alone, a name one associated with everything else in Russia for an obvious, post-Stalin reason. But everything else about 
the Stalintrek shrieked mystery 
and adventure. Where did you 
go? How did you get there? What 
did you do? Why? 

A million questions which had 
kept her awake at night and, if 
she thought about them hard 
enough, satisfied her deep longing 
for something different. And then 
one day when stolid Mrs. Ivanovna-Rasnikov had said, "It is a 
joke, a terrible, terrible joke they 
are taking my husband Fyodor on 
the Stalintrek when he lacks sufficient imagination to go from here 
to Leningrad or even Tula. Can 
you picture Fyodor on the Stalintrek? Better they should have 
taken me. Better they should 
have taken his wife." That day 
Sophia could hardly contain herself. 

As a party member she had access to the law and she read it 
three times from start to finish 
(in her dingy flat by the light of 
a smoking, foul-smelling, soft


wax candle) but could find nothing barring women from the Stalintrek. 

Had Fyodor Rasnikov volunteered? Naturally. Everyone volunteered, although when your name 
was called you had no choice. 
There had been no draft in Russia 
since the days of the Second War 
of the People's Liberation. Volunteer? What, precisely, did the 
word mean? 

She, Sophia Androvna Petrovitch would volunteer, without 
being told. Thus it was she found 
herself at 616 Stalin Avenue, and 
thus the balding, myopic, bullnecked Comrade thrust the papers across his desk at her. 

She signed her name with such 
vehemence and ferocity that she 
almost tore through the paper. 

CHAPTER II 

Threescore men sit in the 
crowded, smoke-filled room. Some 
drink beer, some squat in moody 
silence, some talk in an animated 
fashion about nothing very urgent. At the one small door, two 
guards pace back and forth slowly, creating a gentle swaying of 
smoke-patterns in the hazy room. 
The guards, in simple military uniform, carry small, deadly looking 
weapons. 

FIRST MAN: Fight City Hall? 
Are you kidding? They took you, 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



i5 



bud. Don't try to fight it. I 
know. I know. 

SECOND MAN: I'm telling you, 
there was a mistake in the records. 
I'm over twenty-six. Two weeks 
and two days. Already I wrote 
to my Congressman. Hell, that's 
why I voted for him, he better go 
to bat for me. 

THIRD MAN: You think that's 
something? I wouldn't be here 
only those doctors are crazy. I 
mean, crazy. Me, with a cyst big 
as a golf ball on the base of my 
spine. 

FIRST MAN: You too. Don't try 
to fight it. 

FOURTH MAN: (Newly named 
Alaric Arkalion III) I "look forward to this as a stimulating adventure. Does the fact that they 
select men for the Nowhere Journey once every seven hundred and 
eighty days strike anyone as significant? 

SECOND MAN: I got my own 
problems. 

ALARIC ARKALION: This is 
not a thalamic problem, young 
man. Not thalamic at all. 
THIRD MAN: Young man? Who 
are you kidding? 

ALARIC ARKALION: (Who 
realizes, thanks to the plastic surgeon, he is the youngest looking of 
all, with red cheeks and peachfuzz whiskers) It is a problem of 
the intellect. Why seven hundred and eighty days? 



FIRST MAN: I read the magazines, too, chief. You think we're 
all going to the planet Mars. How 
original. 

ALARIC ARKALION: As a matter of fact, that is exactly what I

SECOND MAN: Mars? 
FIRST MAN (Laughing) It's a 
long way from Mars to City Hall, 
doc. 

SECOND MAN: You mean, 
through space to Mars? 
ALARIC ARKALION: Exactly, 
exactly. Quite a coincidence, otherwise. 

FIRST MAN: You're telling me. 
ALARIC ARKALION: (Coldly) 
Would you care to explain it? 
FIRST MAN: Why, sure. You 
see, Mars is — uh, I don't want to 
steal your thunder, chief. Go 
ahead. 

ALARIC ARKALION: Once every 
seven hundred and eighty days 
Mars and the Earth find themselves 
in the same orbital position with 
respect to the sun. In other words, 
Mars and Earth are closest then. 
Were there such a thing as space 
travel, new, costly, not thoroughly 
tested, they would want to make 
each journey as brief as possible. 
Hence the seven hundred and 
eighty days. 

FIRST MAN: Not bad, chief. 
You got most of it. 
THIRD MAN: No one ever said 
anything about space travel.

FIRST MAN: You think we'd 
broadcast it or something, stupid? 
It's part of a big, important scientific experiment, only we're the 
hamsters. 

ALARIC ARKALION: Ridiculous. You're forgetting all about 
the Cold War. 

FIRST MAN: He thinks we're 
fighting a war with the Martians. 
(Laughs) Orson Wells stuff, huh? 
ALARIC ARKALION: With the 
Russians. The Russians. We developed A bombs. They developed 
A bombs. We came up with the 
H bomb. So did they. We placed 
a station up in space, a fifth of 
the way to the moon. So did 
they. Then — nothing more about 
scientific developments. For over 
twenty years. I ask, you, doesn't 
it seem peculiar? 
FIRST MAN: Peculiar, he says. 
ALARIC ARKALION: Peculiar. 
SECOND MAN: I wish my Congressman . . . 

FIRST MAN: You and your 
Congressman. The way you talk, 
it was your vote got him in office. 

SECOND MAN: If only I could 
get out and talk to him. 
ALARIC ARKALION: No one is 
permitted to leave. 
FIRST MAN: Punishable by a 
prison term, the law says. 
SECOND MAN. Oh yeah? Prison, 
shmision. Or else go on the Nowhere Journey. Well, I don't see 



the difference. 

FIRST MAN: So, go ahead. Try 
to escape. 

SECOND MAN: (Looking at the 
guards) They got them all over. 
AH over. I think our mail is censored. 

ALARIC ARKALION: It is. 
SECOND MAN: They better 
watch out. I'm losing my temper. 
I get .violent when I lose my temper. 

FIRST MAN: See? See how the 

guards are trembling. 

SECOND MAN: Very funny. 

Maybe you didn't have a good job 

or something? Maybe you don't 

care. I care. I had a job with 

a future. Didn't pay much, but 

a real blue chip future. So they 

send me to Nowhere. 

FIRST MAN: You're not there 

yet. 

SECOND MAN: Yeah, but I'm 
going. 

THIRD MAN: If only they let 
you know when. My back is killing me. I'm waiting to pull a 
sick act. Just waiting, that's all. 
FIRST MAN: Go ahead and wait, 
a lot of good it will do you. 
THIRD MAN: You mind your 
own business. 

FIRST MAN: I am, doc. You 
brought the whole thing up. 
SECOND MAN: He's looking for 
trouble. 

THIRD MAN:- He'll get it. 
ALARIC ARKALION: We're go

ing to be together a long time. A 
long time. Why don't you all relax? 

SECOND MAN: You mind your 
own business. 

FIRST MAN: Nuts, aren't they. 
They're nuts. A sick act, yet. 
SECOND MAN: Look -how it 
doesn't bother him. A failure, he 
was. I can just see it. What does 
he care if he goes away forever 
and doesn't come back? One bread 
line is as good as another. 
FIRST MAN: Ha-ha. 
SECOND MAN: Yeah, well I 
mean it. Forever. We're going 
away, someplace — forever. We're 
not coming back, ever. No one' 
comes back. It's for good, for 
keeps. 

FIRST MAN: Tell it to your 
Congressman. Or maybe you want 
to pull a sick act, too? 
THIRD MAN: (Hits First Man, 
who, surprised, crashes back 
against a table and falls down) It 
isn't an act, damn you! 
GUARD: All right, break it up. 
Come on, break it up. . . 
ALARIC ARKALION: (To himself) I wish I saw that ten million dollars already — if I ever 
get to see it.

highway. 

"Where are we going, Kit?" 

"Search me. Just driving." 

"I'm glad they let you come 
out this once. I don't know what 
they would have done to me if 
they didn't. I had to see you this 
once. I — " 

Temple smiled. He had absented himself without leave. It had 
been difficult enough and he might 
yet be in a lot of hot water, but 
it would be senseless to worry 
Stephanie. "It's just for a few 
hours," he said. 

"Hours. When we want a 
whole lifetime. Kit. Oh, Kit — 
why don't we run away? Just the 
two -of us, someplace where they'll 
never find you. I could be packed and ready and — " 

"Don't talk like that. We can't." 

"You want to go where they're 
sending you. You want to go." 

"For God's sake, how can you 
talk like that? I don't want to 
go anyplace, except with you. But 
we can't run away, Steffy. I've 
got to face it, whatever it is." 

"No you don't. It's noble to be 
patriotic, sure. It always was. 
But this is different, Kit. They 
don't ask for part of your life. 
Not for two years, or three, or a 
gamble because maybe you won't 
ever come back. They ask for all 
of you, for the rest of your life, 
forever, and they don't even tell 
you why. Kit, don't go! We'll

hide someplace and get married 
and—" 

"And nothing." Temple stopped 
the ground-jet, climbed out, opened the door for Stephanie. "Don't 
you see? There's no place to hide. 
Wherever you go, they'd look. You 
wouldn't want to spend the rest of 
your life running, Steffy. Not with 
me or anyone else." 

"I would. I would!" 

"Know what would happen after a few years? We'd hate each 
other. You'd look at me and say 
'I wouldn't be hiding like this, except for you. I'm young and — -' " 

"Kit, that's cruel! I would not." 

"Yes, you would. Steffy, I—" 
A lump rose in his throat. He'd 
tell her goodbye, permanently. He 
had to do it that way, did not 
want her to wait endlessly and 
hopelessly for a return that would 
not materialize. "I didn't get 
permission to leave, Steffy." He 
hadn't meant to tell her that, but 
suddenly it seemed an easy way 
to break into goodbye. 

"What do you mean? No — you 
didn't ..." 

"I had to see you. What can 
they do, send me for longer than 
forever?" 

"Then you do want to run away 
with me!" 

"Steffy, no. When I leave you 
tonight, Steffy, it's for good. That's 
it. The last of Kit Temple. Stop 
thinking about me. I don't exist. 



I- — never was." It sounded ridiculous, even to him. 

"Kit, I love you. I love you. 
How can I forget you?" 

"It's happened before. It will 
happen again." That hurt, too. 
He was talking about a couple of 
statistics, not about himself and 
Stephanie. 

"We're different, Kit. I'll love 
you forever. And — Kit ... I 
know you'll come back to me. I'll 
wait, Kit. We're different. You'll 
come back." 

"How many people do you think 
said that before?" 

"You don't want to come back, 
even if you could. You're not 
thinking of us at all. You're thinking of your brother." 

"You know that isn't true. 
Sometimes I wonder about Jase, 
sure. But if I thought there was 
a chance to return — I'm a selfish 
cuss, Steffy. If I thought there 
was a chance, you know I'd want 
you all for myself. I'd brand you, 
and that's the truth." 

"You do love me!" 

"I loved you, Steffy. Kit Temple loved you." 

"Loved?" 

"Loved. Past tense. When I 
leave tonight, it's as if I don't exist anymore. As if I never existed. 
It's got to be that way, Steffy. In 
thirty years, no one ever returned." 

"Including your brother, Jase. 



VOYAGE TO 

So now you want to find him. 
What do I count for? What ..." 

"This going wasn't my idea. I 
wanted to stay with you. I wanted to marry you. I can't now. 
None of it. Forget me, Steffy. 
Forget you ever knew me. Jase 
said that to our folks before he 
was taken." Almost five years 
before Jason Temple had been selected for the Nowhere Journey. 
He'd been young, though older 
than his brother Kit. Young, unattached, almost cheerful he was. 
Naturally, they never saw him 
again. 

"Hold me, Kit. I'm sorry . . . 
carrying on like this." 

They had walked some distance 
from the ground-jet, through scrub 
oak and bramble bushes. They 
found a clearing, fragrant-scented, 
soft-floored still from last autumn, 
melodic with the chirping of nameless birds. They sat, not talking. 
Stephanie wore a gay summer 
dress, full-skirted, cut deep beneath the throat. She swayed toward him from the waist, nestled 
her head on his shoulder. He could 
smell the soft, sweet fragrance of 
her hair, of the skin at the nape 
of her neck. "If you want to say 
goodbye ..." she said. 

"Stop it," he told her. 

"If you want to say goodbye 

Her head rolled against his 
chest. She turned, cradled herself 



ETERNITY 19 

in his arms, smiled up at him, 
squirmed some more and had her 
head pillowed on his lap. She 
smiled tremulously, misty-eyed. 
Her lips parted. 

He bent and kissed her, knowing it was all wrong. This was not 
goodbye, not the way he wanted 
it. Quickly, definitely, for once 
and all. With a tear, perhaps, a 
lot of tears. But permanent goodbye. This was all wrong. The 
whole idea was to be business-like, 
objective. It had to be done that 
way, or no way at all. Briefly, he 
regretted leaving the encampment. 

This wasn't goodbye the way he 
wanted it. The way it had to be. 
This was auf weidersen. 

And then he forgot everything 
but Stephanie . . . 

((T AM Alaric Arkalion III," 
*■ said the extremely younglooking man with the old, wise 
eyes. 

How incongruous, Temple 
thought. The eyes look almost 
middle-aged. The rest of him — a 
boy. 

"Something tells me we'll be seeing a lot of each other," Arkalion 
went on. The voice was that of an 
older man, too, belying the youthful complexion, the almost childish features, the soft fuzz of a 
beard. 

"I'm Kit Temple," said Temple, 
extending his hand. "Arkalion, a

IMAGINATION 



strange name. I know it from 
somewhere . . . Say! Aren't you — • 
don't you have something to do 
with carpets or something?" 

"Here and now, no. I am a number. A-02-6417. But my father 
is- — perhaps I had better say was 
— my father is Alaric Arkalion II. 
Yes, that is right, the carpet king." 

"I'll be darned," said Temple. 

"Why?" 

"Well," Temple laughed. "I 
never met a billionaire before." 

"Here I am not a billionaire, 
nor will I ever be one again. 
A-92-6417, a number. On his way 
to Mars with a bunch of other 
numbers." 

"Mars? You sound sure of 
yourself." 

"Reasonably. Ah, it is a pleasure to talk with a gentleman. I 
am reasonably certain it will be 
Mars." 

Temple nodded in agreement. 
"That's what the Sunday supplements say, all right." 

"And doubtless you have observed no one denies it." 

"But what on Earth do we want 
on Mars?" 

"That in itself is a contradiction," laughed Arkalion. "We'll 
find out, though, Temple." 

They had reached the head of 
the line, found themselves entering a huge, double-decker jettransport. They found two seats 
together, followed the instructions 



printed at the head of the aisle by 
strapping themselves in and not 
smoking. Talking all around 
them was subdued. 

"Contrariness has given way to 
fear," Arkalion observed. "You 
should have seen them the last 
few days, waiting around the induction center, a two-ton chip on 
each shoulder. Say, where were 
you?" 

"I — what do you mean?" 

"I didn't see you until last evening. Suddenly, you were here." 

"Did anyone else miss me?" 

"But I remember you the first 
day." 

"Did anyone else miss me? Any 
of the officials?" 

"No. Not that I know of." 

"Then I was here," Temple said, 
very seriously. 

Arkalion smiled. "By George, 
of course. Then you were here. 
Temple, we'll get along fine." 
Temple said that was swell. 

"Anyway, we'd better. Forever 
is a long time." 

Three minutes later, the jet took 
off and soared on eager wings toward the setting sun. 

CCA/TEN, since we are leaving 
▼ J- here in a few hours and 
since there is no way to get out of 
the encampment and no place to 
go over the desert even if you 
could," the microphone in the 
great, empty hall boomed as the

two files of men marched in, "there 
is no harm in telling you where 
you are. From this point, in a 
limited sense, you shall be kept 
abreast of your progress. 

"We are in White Sands, New 
Mexico." 

"The Garden Spot of the Universe!" someone shouted derisively, 
remembering the bleak hot desert 
and jagged mountain peaks as 
they came down. 

"White Sands," muttered Arkalion. "It looks like space travel 
now, doesn't it, Kit." 

Temple shrugged. "Why?" 

"White sands was the center of 
experiments in rocketry decades 
ago, when people still talked about 
those things. Then, for a long 
time, no one heard anything about 
White Sands. The rockets grew 
here, Kit." 

"I can readily see why. You 
could look all your life without 
finding a barren spot like this." 

"Precisely. Someone once called 
this place — or was it some other 
place like it? — someone once called it a good place to throw old 
razor blades. If people still used 
razor blades." 

The microphone blared again, 
after the several hundred men had 
entered the great hall and milled 
about among the echoes. Temple 
could picture other halls like this, 
other briefings. "Men, whenever 
you are given instructions, in here 



or elsewhere, obey them instantly. 
Our job is a big one, complicated 
and exacting. Attention to detail 
will save us trouble." 

Someone said, "My old man 
served a hitch in the arnry, back in 
the sixties. That's what he always said, attention to details. 
The army is crazy about things 
like that. Are we in the army or 
something?" 

"This is not the army, but the 
function is similar," barked the 
microphone. "Do as you are told 
and you will get along." 

Stirrings in the crowd. Mutterings. Temple gaped. Microphone, 
yes — but receivers also, placed 
strategically, all around the hall, 
to pick up sound. Telio receivers 
too, perhaps? It marie him feel 
something like a goldfish. 

Apparently someone liked the 
idea of the two-way microphones. 
"I got a question. When are we 
coming back?" 

Laughter. Hooting. Catcalls. 

Blared the microphone: "There 
is a rotation system in operation, 
men. When it is feasible, men will 
be rotated." 

"Yeah, in thirty years it ain't 
been whatsiz — feasible — once!" 

"That, unfortunately, is correct. 
When the situation permits, we 
will rotate you home." 

"From where? Where are we 
going?" 

"At least tell us that." 



22 



IMAGINATION 



"Where?" 

"How about that?" 

There was a pause, then the 
microphone barked: "I don't know 
the answer to that question. You 
won't believe me, but it is the 
truth. No one knows where you 
are going. No one. Except the 
people who are already there." 

More catcalls. 

"That doesn't make sense," Arkalion whispered. "If it's space 
travel, the pilots would know, 
wouldn't they?" 

"Automatic?" Temple suggested. 

"I doubt it. Space travel must 
still be new, even if it ha*s thirty 
years under its belt* If that man 
speaks the truth — if no one knows 
. . . just where in the universe are 
we going?" 

CHAPTER III 

tCTTEY, looka me. I'm flying!" 

*■ * "Will you get your big 
fat feet out of my face?" 

"Sure. Show me how to swim 
away through air, I'll be glad to." 

"Leggo that spoon!" 

"I ain't got your spoon." 

"Will you look at it float away. 
Hey spoon, hey!" 

"Watch this, Charlie. This will 
get you. I mean, get you." 

"What are you gonna do?" 

"Relax, chum." 

"Leggo my leg. Help! I'm up 
in the air. Stop that." 

"I said relax. There. Ha-ha, 



lookit him spin, just like a top. 
All you got to do is get him started 
and he spins like a top with arms 
and legs. Top of the morning to

of the . . . " 

"Someone stop me, I'm getting 
dizzy." 

They floated, tumbled, spun 
around the spaceship's lounge 
room in simple, childish glee. They 
cavorted in festive weightlessness. 

"They're happy now," Arkalion 
observed. "The novelty of free 
fall, of weighing exactly nothing, 
strikes them as amusing." 

"I think I'm getting the hang 
of it," said Temple. Clumsily, he 
made a few tentative swimming 
motions in the air, propelling himself forward a few yards before 
he lost his balance and tumbled 
head over heels against the wall. 

Arkalion came to him quickly, 
in a combination of swimming 
and pushing with hands and feet 
against the wall. Arkalion righted him expertly, sat down gingerly 
beside him. "If you keep sudden 
motions to a minimum, you'll get 
along fine. More than anything 
else, that's the secret of it." 

Temple nodded. "It's sort of 
like the first time you're on ice 
skates. Say, how come you're so 
good at it?" 

"I used to read the old, theoretical books on space- travel." The 
words poured out effortlessly, 



2 4 



IMAGINATION 



smoothly. "I'm merely applying 
the theories put forward as early 
as the 1950's." 

"Oh." But it left Temple with 
some food for thought. Alaric Arkalion was a queer duck, anyway, 
and of all the men gathered in the 
spaceship's lounge, he alone had 
mastered weightlessness with hardly any trouble. 

"Take your ice skates," Arkalion went on. "Some people put 
them on and use them like natural 
extensions of their feet the first 
time. Others fall all over them-' 
selves. I suppose I am lucky." 

"Sure," said Temple. Actually, 
the only thing odd about Arkalion 
was his old-young face and — perhaps — his propensity for coming 
up with the right answers at the 
right times. Arkalion had seemed 
so certain of space-travel. He'd 
hardly batted an eyelash when 
they boarded a long, tapering, bullet-shaped ship at White Sands and 
thundered off into the sky. He 
took for granted the change-over 
to a huge round ship at the wheelshaped station in space. Moments 
after leaving the space station — 
with a minimum of stress and 
strain, thanks to the almost-nil 
gravity — it was Arkalion who first 
swam through air to the viewport 
and pointed out the huge crescent 
earth, green and gray and brown, 
sparkling with patches of dazzling 
silver-white. "You will observe it 



is a crescent," Arkalion had said. 
"It is closer to the sun than we 
are, and off at an angle. As I 
suspected, our destination is 
Mars." 

THEN everyone was saying 
goodbye to earth. Fantastic, 
it seemed. There were tears, there 
was laughter, cursing, promises of 
return, awkward verbal comparisons with the crescent moon, vows 
of faithfulness to lovers and sweethearts. And there was Arkalion, 
with an avid expression in the old 
eyes, Arkalion with his boyish face, 
not saying goodbye so much as 
he was calling hello to something 
Temple could not fathom. 

Now, as he struggled awkwardly with weightlessness, Temple 
called it his imagination. His 
thought-patterns shifted vaguely, 
without motivaton, from the 
gleaming, polished interior of the 
ship with its smell of antiseptic 
and metal polish to the clear Spring 
air of Earth, blue of sky and 
bright of sun. The unique blue 
sky of Earth which he somehow 
knew could not be duplicated elsewhere. Elsewhere — the word itself 
bordered on the meaningless. 

And Stephanie. The brief warm 
ecstasy of her — once, forever. He 
wondered with surprising objectivity if a hundred other names, a 
hundred other women were not 
in a hundred other minds while ev


VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



eryone stared at the crescent Earth 
hanging serenely in space — with 
each name and each woman as 
dear as Stephanie, with the same 
combination of fire and gentle 
femininity stirring the blood but 
saddening the heart. Would Ste' phanie really forget him? Did he 
want her to? That part of him 
burned by the fire of her said no 
— no, she must not forget him. She 
was his, his alone, roped and 
branded though a universe separated them. But someplace in his 
heart was the thought, the understanding, the realization that although Stephanie might keep a 
small place for him tucked someplace deep in her emotions, she 
must forget. He was gone — permanently. For Stephanie, he was 
dead. It was as he had told her 
that last stolen day. It was . . . 
Stephanie, Stephanie, how much I 
love you . . . 

Struggling with weightlessness, 
he made his way back to the small 
room he shared with Arkalion. 
Hardly more than a cubicle, it 
was, with sufficient room for two 
beds, a sink, a small chest. He 
lay down and slept, murmuring 
Stephanie's name in his sleep. 

T TE awoke to the faint hum of 
*> ■*■ the air-pumps, got up feeling 
rested, forgot his weightlessness 
and floated to the ceiling where 
only an outthrust arm prevented 



a nasty bump on his head. He 
used hand grips on the wall to let 
himself down. He washed, aware 
of no way to prevent the water 
he splashed on his face from forming fine droplets and spraying the 
entire room. When he crossed 
back to the foot of his bed to 
get his towel he thrust one foot 
out too rapidly, lost his balance, 
half-rose, stumbled and fell against 
the other bed which, like all other 
items of furniture, was fastened 
to the floor. But his elbow struck 
sleeping Arkalion's jaw sharply, 
hard enough to jar the man's teeth. 

"I'm sorry," said Temple. "Didn't mean to do that," he apologized again, feeling embarrassed. 

Arkalion merely lay there. 

"I said I'm sorry." 

Arkalion still slept. It seemed 
inconceivable, for Temple's elbow 
pained him considerably. He bent 
down, examined his inert companion. 

Arkalion stirred not a muscle. 

Vaguely alarmed, Temple thrust 
a hand to Arkalion's chest, felt 
nothing. He crouched, rested the 
side of his head over Arkalion's 
heart. He listened, heard — nothing. 

What was going on here? 

"Hey, Arkalion!" Temple shook 
him, gently at first, then with savage force. Weightless, Arkalion's 
body floated up off the bed, taking the covers with it. His own

heart pounding furiously, Temple 
got it down again, fingered the left 
wrist and swallowed nervously. 

Temple had never seen a dead 
man before. Arkalion's heart did 
not beat. Arkalion had no pulse. 

Arkalion was dead. 

Yelling hoarsely. Temple plunged from the room, soaring off the 
floor in his haste and striking his 
head against the ceiling hard 
enough to make him see stars. 
"This guy is dead!" he cried. "Arkalion is dead." 

Men stirred in the companionway. Someone called for one of 
the armed guards who were constantly on patrol. 

"If he's dead, you're yelling 
loud enough to get him out of his 
grave." The voice was quiet, 
amused. 

Arkalion. 

"What?" Temple blurted, whirling around and striking his head 
again. A little wild-eyed, he reentered the room. 

"Now, who is dead, Kit?" demanded Arkalion, sitting up and 
stretching comfortably. 

"Who — is dead? Who — ?" 
Open-mouthed, Temple stared. 

\ GUARD, completely at home 
with weightlessness, entered 
the cubicle briskly. "What's the 
trouble in here? Something about 
a dead man, they said." 

"A dead man?" demanded Ar


kalion. "Indeed." 

"Dead?" muttered Temple, 
lamely and foolishly. "Dead . . ." 

Arkalion smiled deprecatingly. 
"My friend must have been talking in his sleep. The only thing 
dead in here is my appetite. 
Weightlessness doesn't let you become very hungry." 

"You'll grow used to it," the 
guard promised. He patted his 
paunch happily. "I am. Well, 
don't raise the alarm unless there's 
some trouble. Remember about 
the boy who cried wolf." 

"Of course," said Temple. 
"Sure. Sorry." 

He watched the guard depart. 

"Bad dream?" Arkalion wanted 
to know. 

"Bad dream, my foot. I accidentally hit you. Hard enough to 
hurt. You didn't move." 

"I'm a sound sleeper." 

"I felt for your heart. It wasn't 
beating. It wasn't!" 

"Oh, come, come." 

"Your heart was not beating, I 
said." 

"And I suppose I was cold as a 
slab of ice?" 

"Umm, no. I don't remember. 
Maybe you were. You had no 
pulse, either." 

Arkalion laughed easily. "And 
am I still dead?" 

"Well—" 

"Clearly a case of overwrought 
nerves and a highly keyed imag

ination. What you need is some 
more sleep." 

"I'm not sleepy, thanks." 

"Well, I think I'll get up and 
go down for breakfast." Arkalion 
climbed out of bed gingerly, made 
his way to the sink and was soon 
gargling with a bottle of prepared 
mouthwash, occasionally spraying 
weightless droplets of the pink 
liquid up at the ceiling. 

Temple lit a cigarette with shaking fingers, made his way to Arkalion's bed while the man hummed tunelessly at the sink. Temple let his hands fall on the sheet. 
It was not cold, but comfortably 
cool. Hardly as warm as it should 
have been, with a man sleeping on 
it all night. 

Was he still imagining things? 

"I'm glad you didn't call for 
a burial detail and have me expelled into space with yesterday's garbage," Arkalion called over his 
shoulder jauntily as he went outside for some breakfast. 

Temple cursed softly and lit 
another cigarette, dropping the 
first one into a disposal chute on 
the wall. 

TT 1 VERY night thereafter, Tem' pie made it a point to remain 
awake after Arkalion apparently 
had fallen asleep. But if he were 
seeking repetition of the peculiar 
occurrence, he was disappointed. 
Not only did Arkalion sleep sound


» ETERNITY 27 

ly and through the night, but he 
snored. Loudly and clearly, a 
wheezing snore. 

Arkalion's strange feat — or his 
own overwrought imagination, 
Temple thought wryly — was good 
for one thing: it took his mind off 
Stephanie. The days wore on in 
• endless, monotonous routine. He 
took some books from the ship's 
library and browsed through them, 
even managing to find one concerned with traumatic catalepsy, 
which stated that a severe emotional shock might render one into 
a deep enough trance to have a 
layman mistakenly pronounce him 
dead. But what had been the 
severe emotional disturbance for 
Arkalion? Could the effects of 
weightlessness manifest themselves 
in that way in rare instances? 
Temple naturally did not know, 
but he resolved to find out if he 
could after reaching their destination. 

One day — it was three weeks after they left the space station, 
Temple realized — they were all 
called to assembly in the ship's 
large main lounge. As the men 
drifted in, Temple was amazed to 
see the progress they had made 
with weightlessness. He himself 
had advanced to handy facility in 
locomotion, but it struck him all 
the more pointedly when he saw 
two hundred men swim and float 
through air, pushing themselves 



IMAGINATION 



along by means of the hand-holds 
strategically placed along the 
walls. 

The ever-present microphone 
greeted them all. "Good afternoon, 
men." Vw . 

"Good afternoon, mac!" 

"Hey, is this the way to Ebbetts' Field?" 

"Get on with it!" 

"Sounds like the same man who 
addressed us in White Sands," 
Temple told Arkalion. "He sure 
does get around." 

"A recording, probably. Listen." 

"Our destination, as you've probably read in newspapers and magazines, is the planet Mars." 

Mutterings in the assembly, not 
many of surprise. 

"Their suppositions, based both 
on the seven hundred eighty day 
lapse between Nowhere Journeys 
and the romantic position in which 
the planet Mars has always been 
held, are correct. We are going 
to Mars. 

"For most of you, Mars will be 
a permanent home for many years 
to come — " 

"Most of us?" Temple wondered 
out loud. 

Arkalion raised a finger to his 
lips for silence. 

" — until such time as you are 
rotated according to the policy of 
rotation set up by the government." 

Temple had grown accustomed 



to the familiar hoots and catcalls. 
He almost had an urge to join in 
himself. 

"Interesting," Arkalion pointed 
out. "Back at White Sands they 
claimed not to know our destination. They knew it all right — 
up to a point. The planet Mars. 
But now they say that all of us 
will not remain on Mars. Most 
interesting." 

" — further indoctrination in our 
mission soon after our arrival on 
the red planet. Landing will be 
performed under somewhat less 
strain than the initial takeoff in 
the Earth-to-station ferry, since 
Mars exerts less of a gravity pull 
than Earth. On the other hand, 
you have been weightless for three 
weeks and the change-over is liable to make some of you sick. It 
will pass harmlessly enough. 

"We realize it is difficult, being 
taken from your homes without 
knowing the nature of your urgent 
mission. All I can tell you now— 
and, as a matter of fact, all I 
know — " 

"Here we go again," said Temple. "More riddles." 

" — is that everything is of the 
utmost urgency. Our entire way 
of life is at stake. Our job will 
be to safeguard it. In the months 
which follow, few of you will have 
any big, significant role to play, 
but all of you, working together, 
will provide the strength we need. 



.VOYAGE TO ETERNITY

When the cadre — " 

"So they call their guards teachers," Arkalion commented dryly. 

" — come around, they will see 
that each man is strapped properly into his bunk for deceleration. 
Deceleration begins in twentyseven minutes." 

Mars, thought Temple, back in 
his room with Arkalion. Mars. 
He did not think of Stephanie, except as a man who knows he must 
spend the rest of his life in prison 
might think of a lush green field, 
or the cool swish of skis over -fresh, 
powdery snow, or the sound of 
yardarms creaking against the 
wind on a small sailing schooner, 
or the tang of wieners roasting 
over an open fire with the crisp 
air of fall against your back, or 
the scent of good French brandy, 
or a woman. 

Deceleration began promptly. 
Before his face was distorted and 
his eyes forced shut by a pressure 
of four gravities, Temple had time 
to see the look of complete unconcern on Arkalion's face. Arkalion, in fact, was sleeping. 

He seemed as completely relaxed as he did that morning Temple thought he was dead. 

CHAPTER IV 

CtpETROVITCH, S. A.!" call1 ed the Comrade standing 
abreast of the head of the line, a 



thin, nervous man half a head 
shorter than the girl herself. Sophia Androvna Petrovitch strode 
forward, took a pair of trim white 
shorts from the neat stack at his 
left. 

"Is that all?" she said, looking at 
him. 

"Yes, Comrade. Well, a woman. Well." 

Without embarrassment, Sophia 
had seen the men ahead of her in 
line strip and climb into the white 
shorts before they disappeared 
through a portal ahead of the line, 
depositing their clothing -in a growing pile on the floor. But now it 
was Sophia's turn, after almost a 
two hour wait. Not that it was 
chilly, but . . . 

"Is that all?" she repeated. 

"Certainly. Strip and move 
along, Comrade." The nervous 
little man appraised her lecherously, she thought. 

"Then I must keep some of my 
own clothing," she told him. 

"Impossible. I have my orders." 

"I am a woman." 

"You are a volunteer for the 
Stalintrek. Y«u will take no personal property — no clothing*— 
with you. Strip and advance, 
please." 

Sophia flushed slightly, while 
the men behind her began to call 
and taunt. 

"I like this Stalintrek." 

"Oh, yes." 



30 



IMAGINATION 



"We are waiting, Comrade." 

Quickly and with an objective 
detachment which surprised her, 
Sophia unbuttoned her shirt, removed it. Her one wish — and an 
odd one, she thought, smiling — 
was for wax for her ears. She 
loosened the three snaps of her 
skirt, watched it fall to the floor. 
• She stood there briefly, lithe-limbed, a tall, slim girl, then had the 
white shorts over her nakedness in 
one quick motion. She still wore a 
coarse halter. 

"All personal effects, Comrade," 
said the nervous little man. 

"No," Sophia told him. 

"But yes. Definitely, yes. You 
hold up the line, and we have a 
schedule to maintain. The Stalintrek demands quick, prompt obedience." 

"Then you will give me one additional item of clothing." 

The man looked at Sophia's halter, at the fine way she filled it. 
He shrugged. "We don't have it," 
he said, clearly enjoying himself. 

In volunteering for the Stalintrek, Sophia had invaded man's 
domain. She had watched not 
with embarrassment but with 
scorn while the men in front of 
her got out of their clothing. She 
had invaded man's domain, and as 
she watched them, the short, flabby ones, the bony ones with protruding ribs and collar-bones, those 
of milky white skin and soft hands, 



she knew most of them would bite 
off more than they could chew if 
ever they tried what was the most 
natural thing for men to try with 
a lone woman in an isolated environment. But she was in a 
man's world now, and if that was 
the way they wanted it, she would 
ask no quarter. 

She reached up quickly with 
one hand and unfastened the halter, catching it with her free hand 
and holding it in front of her 
breasts while the nervous little 
man licked his lips and gaped. 
Sophia grabbed another pair of the 
white shorts, tore it quickly with 
her strong fingers, fashioning a 
crude covering for herself. This she 
pulled around her, fastening it securely with a knot in back. 

"You'll have to give that back 
to me," declared the nervous little 
Comrade. 

"I'll bet you a samovar on that," 
Sophia said quietly, so only the 
man heard her. 

He reached out, as if to rip the 
crude halter from her body, but 
Sophia met him halfway with her 
strong, slim fingers, wrapping 
them around his biceps and squeezing. The man's face turned quickly to white as he tried unsuccessfully to free his arm. 

"Please, that hurts." 

"I keep what I am wearing." 
She tightened her grip, but gazed 
serenely into space as the man 



VOYAGE TO 

stifled a whimper. 

"Well — " the man whispered indecisively as he gritted his teeth. 

"Fool!" said Sophia. "Your 
arm will be black and blue for a 
week. While you men grow soft and 
lazy, many of the women take their 
gymnastics seriously, especially if 
they want to keep their figures 
with the work they must do and 
the food they must eat. I am stronger than you and I will hurt you unless — •" And her hand tightened 
around his scrawny arm until her 
knuckles showed white. 

"Wear what you have and go," 
the man pleaded, and moaned softly when Sophia released his numb 
arm and strode through the portal, 
still drawing whistles and leers 
from the other men, who missed 
the by-play completely. 

(tQO we're on Mars!" 

*3 "It ain't Nowhere after 
all, it's Mars." 

"Wait and see, buster. Wait 
and see." 

"Kind of cold, isn't it? Well, if 
this was Venus and some of them 
beautiful one-armed dames was 
waiting for us — " 

"That's just a statue, stupid." 

"Lookit all them people down 
there, will you?" 

"You think they're Martians?" 

"Stupid! We ain't the first 
ones went on the Nowhere Journey." 



ETERNITY 31 

"What are we waiting for? It 
sure will feel good to stretch your 
legs." 

"Let's -go!" 

"Look out, Mars, here I come!" 

It would have been just right 
for a Hollywood epic, Temple 
thought. The rusty ochre emptiness spreading out toward the 
horizon in all directions, spotted 
occasionally with pale green and 
frosty white, the sky gray with 
but a shade of blue in it, distant 
gusts of Martian wind swirling 
ochre clouds across the desert, 
the spaceship poised on its ungainly bottom, a great silver bowling 
ball with rocket tubes for finger 
holes, and the Martians from 
Earth who had been here on this 
alien world for seven-hundredeighty days or twice seven-eighty 
or three times, and who fought in 
frenzied eagerness, like savages, to 
reach the descending gangplank 
first. 

Earth chorus: Hey, Martians, 
any of you guys speak English? 
Hah-ha, I said, any of you guys . . . 

Where are all them canals I 
heard so much about? 

You think maybe they're dangerous? (Laughter) 

No dames. Hey, no dames . . . 

Who were you expecting, Donna 
Daunley? 

What kind of place is Mars with 
no women? 

What do they do here, anyway, 



32 



IMAGINATION 



just sit around and wait for the 
next rocket? 
I'm cold. 

Get used to it, brother, get 
used to it. 

Look out, Mars, here I come! 

Martian chorus: Who won the 
Series last year, Detroit? 

Hey, bud, tell me, are dames 
still wearing those one piece things, 
all colors, so you see their legs up 
to about here and their chests 
down to about here? (Gestures 
lewdly) 

Which one of you guys can tell 
me what it's like to take a bath? 
I mean a real bath in a real bath 
tub. 

Hey, we licked Russia yet? 

We heard they were gonna send 
some dames! 

Dames — ha-ha, you're breaking 
my heart. 

Tell me what a steak tastes like. 
So thick. 

Me? Gimme a bowl of steamed 
oysters. And a dame. 

Dames. Girls. Women. Females. Ghicks. Tomatoes. Frails. 
Dames. Dames. Dames . . . 

They did not seem to mind the 
cold, these Earth-Martians. Temple guessed they never spent much 
time out of doors (above ground, 
for there were no buildings?) because all seemed pale and white. 
While the sun was weaker, so was 
the protection offered by a thinner atmosphere. The sun's actinic 



rays could burn, and so could the 
sand-driving wind. But pale 
skins could not be the result of 
staying indoors, for Temple noted 
the lack of man-made structures at 
once. Underground, then. The 
Earth-Martians lived underground 
like moles. Doing what? And -for 
what reason? With what ultimate 
goal, if any? And where did those 
men who did not remain on Mars 
go? Temple's head whirled^with 
countless questions — and no answers. 

Shoulder to shoulder with Arkalion, he made his way down the 
gangplank, turning up the collar 
of his jumper against the stinging 
wind. 

"You got any newspapers, pal?" 

"Magazines?" 

"Phonograph records?" 

"Gossip?" 

"Newsfilm?" 

"Who's the heavyweight champ?" 

"We lick those Commies in 
Burma yet?" 

"Step back! Watch that man. 
Maybe he's your replacement." 

"Replacement. Ha-ha. That's 
good." : • 

All types of men. All ages. In 
torn, tattered clothing, mostly. In 
rags. Even if a man seemed more 
well-groomed than the rest, on 
closer examination Temple could 
see the careful stitching, the patches, the fades and stains. No one 
seemed to mind. 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



33 



"Hey, bud. What do you hear 
about rotation? They passed any 
laws yet?" 

"I been here ten years. When 
do / get rotated?" 

"Ain't that something? Dad 
Jenks came here with the first 
ship. Don't you talk about rotation. Ask Dad." 

"Better not mention that word 
to Dad Jenks. He sees red." 

"This whole damn planet is 
red." 

"Want a guided tour of nowhere, 
men? Step right up." 

ArkaHon grinned. "They seem 
so well-adjusted," he said, then 
shuddered against the cold and 
followed Temple, with the others, 
through the crowd. 

'""pHEY were inoculated against 
naimeless diseases. (Watch 
for the needle with the hook) 

They were told again they had 
arrived on the planet Mars. (No 
kidding?) 

Led to a drab underground city, 
dimly lit, dank, noisome with mold 
and mildew. (Quick, the chlorophyll) 

Assigned bunks in a dormitory, 
with four men to a room. (Be it 
ever so humble — bah!) 

Told to keep things clean and 
assigned temporarily to a garbage 
pickup detail. (For this I left 
Sheboygan?) 

Read to from the Declaration of 



Independence, the Constitution 
and Public Law 1182 (concerned 
with the Nowhere Journey, it told 
them nothing they did not already 
know) . 

Given as complete a battery of 
tests, mental, emotional and physical, as Temple ever knew existed. 
(Cripes, man! How the hell should 
I know what the cube root of ~~ 5 
is? I never finished high school!) 

Subjected to an exhaustive, overlong, and at times meaningless 
personal interview. (No, doc, honest. I never knew I had a — uh 
— anxiety neurosis. Is it dangerous?) 

"How do you do, Temple? Sit 
down." 

"Thank you." 

"Thought you'd like to know 
that while your overall test score 
is not uncanny, it's decidedly 
high." 

"So what?" 

"So nothing — not necessarily. 
Except that with it you have a 
very well balanced personality. We 
can use you, Temple." 

"That's why I'm here." 

"I mean — elsewhere. Mars is 
only a way station, a training center for a select few. It takes an 
awful lot of administrative work 
to keep this place going, which 
explains the need for all the station personnel." 

"Listen. The last few weeks I 
had everything thrown at me. 



34 



IMAGINATION 



Everything, the works. Mind answering one question?" 
"Shoot." 

"What's this all about?" 
"Temple, I don't know!" 
"You what?" 

"I know you find it hard to believe, but I don't. There isn't a 
man here on Mars who knows the 
whole story, either — and certainly 
not on Earth. We know enough to 
keep everything in operation. And 
we know it's important, all of it, 
everything we do." 

"You mentioned a need for some 
men elsewhere. Where?" 

The psychiatrist shrugged. "I 
don't know. Somewhere. Anywhere." He spread his hands out 
eloquently. "That's where the 
Nowhere Journey comes in." 

"Surely you can tell me something more than — " 

"Absolutely not. It isn't that 
I don't want to. I can't. I don't 
know." 

"Well, one more question I'd 
like you to answer." 

The psychiatrist lit a cigarette, 
grinned. "Say, who is interviewing whom?" 

"This one I think you can tackle. I have a brother, Jason Temple. Embarked on the Nowhere 
Journey five years ago. I wonder—" 

"So that's the one factor in your 
psychograph we couldn't figure 
out — anxiety over your brother." 



"I doubt it," shrugged Temple. 
"More likely my fiancee." 

"Umm, common enough. You 
were to be married?" 

"Yes." Stephanie, what are you 
doing now? Right now? 

"That's what hurts the most 
. . . Well, yes, I can find out about 
your brother." The psychiatrist 
flicked a toggle on his desk. "Jamison, find what you can on Temple, Jason, year of — " 

"1987," Temple supplied. 

"1987. We'll wait." 

After a moment or two, the voice 
came through, faintly metallic: 
"Temple, Jason. Arrival: 1987. 
Psychograph, iisbi2. Mental aggregate, 98. Physcom, good to excellent. Training: two years, 
space perception concentrate, others. Shipped out: 1989." 

So Jase had shipped out for — 
Nowhere. 

"Someday you'll follow in your 
brother's footsteps, Temple. Now, 
though, I have a few hundred 
questions I'd like you to answer." 

The psychiatrist hadn't exaggerated. Several hours of questioning followed. Once reminded 
of her, Temple found it hard to 
keep his thought off Stephanie. 

He left the psychiatrist's office 
more confused than ever. 

U/^OOD morning, child. You 
^-*are Stephanie Andrews?" 
Stephanie hadn't felt up to 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



35 



working that first morning after 
Kit's final goodbye. She answered 
the door in her bathrobe, saw a 
small, middle-aged woman with 
graying hair and a kind face. 
"That's right. Won't you come 
in?" 

"Thank you. I represent the 
Complete Emancipation League, 
Miss Andrews." 

"Complete Emancipation League? 
Oh, something to do with politics. 
Really, I'm not much interested 
in—" 

"That's entirely the trouble," 
declared the older woman. "Too 
many of us are not interested in 
politics. I'd like to discuss the 
CEL. with you, my dear, if you 
will 'bear with me a few minutes." 

"All right," said Stephanie. 
"Would you like a glass of 
sherry?" 

"In the morning?" the older 
woman smiled. 

"I'm sorry. Don't mind me. My 
fiance left yesterday, took his 
final goodbye. He — he embarked 
on the Nowhere Journey." 

"I realize that. It is precisely why I am here. My dear, the 
C.E.L. does not want to fight the 
government. If the government 
decides that the Nowhere Journey 
is vital for the welfare of the 
country — even if the government 
won't or can't explain what the 
Nowhere Journey is — that's all 
right with us. But if the govern


ment says there is a rotation system but does absolutely nothing 
about it, we're interested in that. 
Do you follow me?" 

"Yes!" cried Stephanie. "Oh, 
yes. Go on." 

"The C. E. L. has sixty-eight 
people in Congress for the current 
term. We hope to raise that number to seventy-five for next election. It's a long fight, a slow uphill fight, and frankly, my dear, 
we need all the help we can get. 
People — young women like yourself, my dear — are entirely too 
lethargic, if you'll forgive me." 

"You ought to forgive me" said 
Stephanie, "if you will. You know, 
it's funny. I had vague ideas 
about helping Kit, about finding 
some way to get him back. Only 
to tackle something like that alone 
. . . I'm only twenty-one, just a 
girl, and I don't know anyone important. No one ever comes back, 
that's what you hear. But there's 
a rotation system, you also hear 
that. If I can he of any help . . ." 

"You certainly can, my dear. 
We'd be delighted to have you." 

"Then, eventually, maybe, just 
maybe, -we'll start getting them 
rotated home?" 

"We can't promise a thing. We 
can only try. And I never did say 
we'd try to get the boys rotated, 
my dear. There is a rotation system in the law, right there in 
Public Law 1182. But if no men 



36 



IMAGINATION 



have ever been rotated, there must 
be a reason for it." 
"Yes, but—" 

"But we'll see. If for some reason rotation simply is not practicable, we'll find another way. 
Which is why we call ourselves the 
C.E.L. — Complete Emancipation 
League — for women. If men must 
embark on the Nowhere Journey 
— the least they can do is let their 
women volunteer to go along with 
them if they want to — since it 
may be forever. Let a bunch of 
women get to this Nowhere place 
and you'll never know what might 
happen, that's what I say." 

Something about the gray haired woman's earthy confidence imbued Stephanie with an optimism 
she never expected. "Well," she 
said, smiling, "if we can't bring 
ourselves to Mohammed . . . No, 
that's all wrong! ... to the mountain . . . ?" 

"Yes, there's an old saying. But 
it isn't important. You get the 
idea. My dear, how would you 
like to go to Nowhere?" 

"I — to Kit, anywhere, anywhere!" I'll never j or get yesterday, Kit darling. Never! 

"I make no promises, Stephanie, 
but it may be sooner than you 
think. Morning be hanged, perhaps I will have some sherry after 
all. Umm, you wouldn't by any 
chance have some Canadian instead?" 



Humming, Stephanie dashed into the kitchen for some glasses. 

'"INHERE were times when the 
real Alaric Arkalion III wished his father would mind his own 
business. Like that thing about the 
Nowhere Journey, for instance. 
Maybe Alaric Sr. didn't realize it, 
but being the spoiled son of a 
billionaire wasn't all fun. "I'm a 
dilettante," Alaric would tell himself often, gazing in the mirror, "a 
bored dilettante at the age of 
twenty-one." 

Which in itself, he had to admit, 
wasn't too bad. But having reneged on the Nowhere Journey in 
favor of a stranger twice his age 
who now carried his, Alaric's face, 
had engendered some annoying 
complications. "You'll either have 
to hide or change your own appearance and identity, Alaric." 

"Hide? For how long, father?" 

"I can't be sure. Years, probably." 

"That's crazy. I'm not going to 
hide for years." 

"Then change your appearance. 
Your way of life. Your occupation." 

"I have no occupation." 

"Get one. Change your face, 
too. Your fingerprints. It can be 
done. Become a new man, live a 
new life." 

In hiding there was boredom, 
impossible boredom. In the other 



VOYAGE TO 

alternative there was adventure, 
intrigue — 'but uncertainty. One 
part of young Alaric craved that 
uncertainty, the rest of him shunned it. In a way it was like the 
Nowhere Journey all over again. 

"Maybe Nowhere wouldn't have 
been so bad," said Alaric to his 
father, choosing as a temporary 
alternative and retreat what he 
knew couldn't possibly happen. 

Couldn't it? 

"If I choose another identity, 
I'd be eligible again for the Nowhere Journey." 

"By George, I hadn't considered 
that. No, wait. You could be 
older than twenty-six." 

"I like it the way I am," Alaric 
said, pouting. 

"Then you'll have to hide. I 
spent ten million dollars to secure 
your future, Alaric. I don't want 
you to throw it away." 

Alaric pouted some more. "Let 
me think about it." 

"Fair enough, but I'll want your 
answer tomorrow. Meanwhile, 
you are not to leave the house." 

Alaric agreed verbally, but took 
the first opportunity which presented itself — that very night — to 
sneak out the servants' door, go 
downtown, and get stewed to the 
gills. 

At two in the morning he was 
picked up by the police for disorderly conduct (it had happened 
before) after losing a fistfight to 



ETERNITY" 37 

a much poorer, much meaner drunk 
in a downtown bar. They questioned Alaric at the police station, 
examined his belongings, went 
through his wallet, notified his 
home. 

Fuming, Alaric Sr. rushed to the 
police station to get his son. He 
was met by the desk sergeant, a 
fat, balding man who wore his uniform in a slovenly fashion. 

"Mr. Arkalion?" demanded the 
sergeant, picking at his teeth with 
a toothpick. 

"Yes. I have come for Alaric, 
my son." 

"Sure. Sure. But your son's in 
trouble, Mr. Arkalion. Serious 
trouble." 

"What are you talking about? If 
there are any damages, I'll pay.' 
He didn't — hurt anyone, did he?" 

The sergeant broke the toothpick between his teeth, laughed. 
"Him? Naw. He got the hell 
beat out of him by a drunk half 
.his size. It ain't that kind of 
trouble, Mr. Arkalion. You know 
what an 1182 card is, mister?" 

Arkalion's face drained white. 
"Why— yes." 

"Alaric's got one." 

"Naturally." 

"According to the card, he 
should have shipped out on the 
Nowhere Journey, mister. He 
didn't. He's in serious trouble." 

"I'll see the district attorney." 

"More'n likely, you'll see the 



IMAGINATION 



attorney general. Serious trouble." 

CHAPTER V 

THE trouble with the Stalintrek, Sophia thought, was that 
it took months to get absolutely 
nowhere. There had been the 
painful pressure, the loss of consciousness, the confinement in this 
tight little world of dormitories 
and gleaming metal walls, the uncanny feeling of no weight, the 
ability — boring after a while, but 
interesting at first — to float about 
in air almost at will. 

Then, how many months of 
sameness? Sophia had lost all 
track of time through ennui. But 
for the first brief period of adjustment on the part of her fellows 
to the fact that although she was 
a woman and shared their man's 
life she was still to be inviolate, 
the routine had been anything but 
exciting. The period of adjustment had had its adventures, its 
uncertainties, its challenge, and to 
Sophia it had been stimulating. 
Why was it, she wondered, that the 
men who carried their sex with 
strength and dignity, the hardmuscled men who could have their 
way with her if they resorted to 
force were the men who did not 
violate her privacy, while the 
weaklings, the softer, smaller 
men, or the average men whom 



Sophia considered her physical 
equals were the ones who gave her 
trouble? 

She had always accepted her 
beauty, the obvious attraction men 
found in her, with an objective unconcern. She had been endowed 
with sex appeal; there was not 
much room in her life to exploit 
it, even had she wanted to. Now, 
now when she wanted anything 
but that, it gave her trouble. 

Her room was shared, of necessity, with three men. Tall, gangling Boris gave her no trouble, 
turned his back when she undressed for the evening, even though 
she was careful to slip under the 
covers first. Ivan, the second 
man, was short, thin, stooped. 
Often she found him looking at 
her with what might have been 
more than a healthy interest, but 
aside from that he kept his peace. 
Besides, Ivan had spent two years 
in secondary school (as much as 
Sophia) and she enjoyed conversing with him. 

The third man, Georgi, was the 
troublemaker. Georgi was one of 
those plump young men with red 
cheeks, big, eager eyes, a voice 
somewhat too high. He was an 
avid talker, a boaster and a boor. 
In the beginning he showered attentions on Sophia. He insisted 
on drawing her wash-basin at 
night, escorted her to breakfast 
every morning, told her in confi


VOYAGE TO 

dence of the conquests he had 
made over beautiful women (but 
not as beautiful as you, Sophia). 
He soon began to take liberties. 
He would sit — timorously at first, 
but with growing boldness — on the 
corner of her bed, talking with her 
at night after the others had retired, Ivan with his snores, Boris 
with his strong, deep breathing. 
And night after night, plump 
Georgi grew bolder. 

He would reach out and touch 
Sophia, he would insist on tucking 
her in at night (let me be your 
big brother), he would awaken her 
in the morning with his hand 
heavy on her shoulder. Finally, 
one night at bedtime, she heard 
him conversing in low whispers 
with Ivan and Boris. She could 
not hear the words, but Boris 
looked at her with what she 
thought was surprise, Ivan nodded 
in an understanding way, and both 
of them left the room. 

Sophia frowned. "What did you 
tell them, Georgi?" 

"That we wanted to be alone 
one evening, of course." 

"I never gave you any indication—" 

"I could see it in your eyes, in 
the way you looked at me." 

"Well, you had better call them 
back inside and go to bed." 

Georgi shook his head, approached her. 

"Georgi! Call them back or I 



ETERNITY 39 
will." 

"No, you won't." Georgi followed her as she retreated into a corner of the room. When she reached the wall and could retreat no 
further, he placed his thick hands 
on her shoulders, drew her to him 
slowly. "You will call no one," 
he rasped. 

SHE ducked under his arms, 
eluded him, was on the point 
of running to the door, throwing 
it open and shouting, when she 
reconsidered. If she did, she would 
be asking for quarter, gaining a 
temporary reprieve, inviting the 
same sort of thing all over again. 

She crossed to the bed and sat 
down. "Come here, Georgi." 
"Ah." He came to her. 
She watched him warily, a soft 
flabby man not quite so tall as 
she was, but who nevertheless outweighed her by thirty or forty 
pounds. In his eagerness, he walked too fast, lost his footing and 
floated gently to the ceiling. Smiling as demurely as she could, 
Sophia reached up, circled his ankle with her hand. 

"I never could get used to this 
weightlessness," Georgi admitted. 
"Be nice and pull me down." 

"I will be nice. I will teach 
you a lesson." 

He weighed exactly nothing. It 
was as simple as stretching. Sophia 
merely extended her arm upwards 



40 



IMAGINATION 



and Georgi's head hit the ceiling 
with a loud thunk. Georgi groaned. Sophia repeated the procedure, 
lowering her arm a foot — and 
Georgi with it — then raising it 
and houncing his head off the 
ceiling. 

"I don't understand," Georgi 
whined, trying to break free but 
only succeeding in thrashing his 
chubby arms foolishly. 

"You haven't mastered weightlessness," Sophia smiled up at 
him. "I have. I said I would 
teach you a lesson. First make 
sure you have the strength of a 
man if you would play a man's 
game." 

Still smiling, Sophia commenced 
spinning the hand which held 
Georgi's ankle. Arms and free leg 
flailing air helplessly, Georgi began to spin. 

"Put me down!" he whined, a 
boy now, not even pretending to 
be a man. When Sophia shoved 
out gently and let his ankle go he 
did a neat flip in air and hung 
suspended, upside down, his feet 
near the ceiling, his head on a level with Sophia's shoulders. He 
cried. 

She slapped his upside down 
face, carefully and without excitement, reddening the cheeks. "I 
was — only joking," he slobbered. 
"Call back our friends." 

Sophia found one of the hard, 
air-tight metal flasks they used for 



drinking in weightlessness. With 
one hand she opened the lid, with 
the other she grasped Georgi's 
shoulder and spun him in air, still 
upside down. She squirted the water in his face, and because he was 
upside down and yelling it made 
him choke and cough. When the 
container was empty she lowered 
Georgi gently to the floor. 

Minutes later, she opened the 
door, summoned Boris and Ivan, 
who came into the room self-consciously. What they found was 
a thoroughly beaten Georgi sobbing on the floor. After that, 
Sophia had no trouble. Week after week of boredom followed and 
she almost wished Georgi or someone else would look for trouble . . . 
even if it were something she could 
not handle, for although she was 
stronger than average and more 
beautiful, she was still a woman 
first, and she knew if the right 
man . . . 

CC'T'VID you know that radio 
■^-^communication is maintained 
between Earth and Mars?" the 
Alaric Arkalion on Mars asked 
Temple. 

"Why, no. I never thought 
about it." 

"It is, and I am in some difficulty." 

"What's the matter?" Temple 
had grown to like Arkalion, despite 
the man's peculiarities. He had 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



4i 



given up trying to figure him out, 
feeling that the only way he'd get 
anywhere was with Arkalion's cooperation. 

"It's a long story which I'm 
afraid you would not altogether 
understand. The authorities on 
Earth don't think I belong here 
on the Nowhere Journey." 

"Is that so? A mistake, huh? 
I sure am glad for you, Alaric." 

"That's not the difficulty. It 
seems that there is the matter of 
impersonation, of violating some 
of the clauses in Public Law 11 82. 
You're glad for me. I'm likely to 
go to prison." 

"If it's that serious, how come 
they told you?" 

"They didn't. But I— managed 
to find out. I won't go into details, Kit, but obviously, if I managed to embark for Nowhere when I 
didn't have to, then I wanted to 
go. Right?" 

"I — uh, guess so. But why — ?" 

"That isn't the point. I still 
want to go. Not to Mars, but to 
Nowhere. I still can, despite what 
has happened, but I need help." 

Temple said, "Anything I can 
do, I'll be glad to," and meant it. 
For one thing, he liked Arkalion. 
For another, Arkalion seemed to 
know more, much more than he 
would ever say — unless Temple 
could win his confidence. For a 
third, Temple was growing sick 
and tired of Mars with its drab 



ochre sameness (when he got to 
the surface, which was rarely), 
with its dank underground city, 
with its meaningless attention to 
meaningless detail. Either way, 
he figured there was no returning 
to Earth. If Nowhere meant adventure, as he suspected it might, 
it would be preferable. Mars might 
have been the other end of the 
galaxy for all its nearness to Earth, 
anyway. 

"There is a great deal you can 
do. But you'll have to come with 
me." 

"Where?" Temple demanded. 

"Where you will go eventually. 
To Nowhere." 

"Fine." And Temple smiled. 
"Why not now as well as later?" 

"I'll be frank with you. If you 
go now, you go untrained. You 
may need your training. Undoubtedly, you will." 

"You know a lot more than you 
want to talk about, don't you?" 

"Frankly, yes ... I am sorry, 
Kit." 

"That's all right. You have your 
reasons. I guess if I go with you 
I'll find out soon enough, anyway." 

Arkalion grinned. "You have 
guessed correctly. I am going to 
Nowhere, before they return me to 
Earth for prosecution under Public 
Law 1 1 82. I cannot go alone, 
for it takes at least two to operate 
. . . well, you'll see." 

"Count me in," said Temple. 



42 



IMAGINATION 



"Remember, you may one day 
wish you had remained on Mars 
for your training." 

"I'll take my chances. Mars is 
driving me crazy. All I do is 
think of Earth and Stephanie." 

"Then come." 

"Where are we going?" 

"A long, long way off. It is unthinkably remote, this place called 
Nowhere." 

Temple felt suddenly like a kid 
playing hookey from school. "Lead 
on," he said, almost jauntily. He 
knew he was leaving Stephanie 
still further behind, but had he 
been in prison on the next street 
to hers, he might as well have been 
a million miles away. 

As for Arkalion — the thought 
suddenly struck Temple — • Arkalion wasn't necessarily leaving his 
world further behind. Perhaps 
Arkalion was going home . . . 

STEPHANIE picked up the 
phone eagerly. In the weeks 
since her first meeting with Mrs. 
Draper of the C.E.L., the older 
woman had been a fountain of information and of hope for her. Stephanie for her part had taken over 
Mrs. Draper's job in her own section of Center City: she was busy 
contacting the two hundred mothers and fifty sweethearts of the 
Nowhere Journey which had taken 
Kit from her. And now Mrs. 
Draper had called with informa


tion. 

"We've successfully combined 
forces with some of the less militant elements in both houses of 
Congress," Mrs. Draper told her 
over the phone. "Do you realize, 
my dear, this marks the first time 
the C.E.L. has managed to put 
something constructive through 
Congress? Until now we've been 
content merely to block legislation, 
such as an increase in the Nowhere 
contingent from ..." 

"Yes, Mrs. Draper. I know all 
that. But what about this constructive thing you've done." 

"Well, my dear, don't count 
your chickens. But we have passed 
the bill, and we expect the President won't veto it. You see, the 
President has two nephews who 

"I know. I know. What bill 
did you pass?" 

"Unfortunately, it's somewhat 
vague. Ultimately, the Nowhere 
Commission must do the deciding, 
but it does pave the way." 

"For what, Mrs. Draper?" 

"Hold onto your hat, my dear. 
The bill authorizes the Nowhere 
Commission to make as much of 
a study as it can of conditions— 
wherever our boys are sent." 

"Oh." Stephanie was disappointed. "That won't get them 
back to us." 

"No. You're right, it won't get 
them back to us. That isn't the 



VOYAGE TO 

idea at all, for there is more than 
one way to skin a cat, my dear. 
The Nowhere Commission will be 
studying conditions — " 

"How can they? I thought everything was so hush-hush, not even Congress knew anything about 
it." 

"That was the first big hurdle 
we have apparently overcome. 
Anyway, they will be studying 
conditions with a view of determining if one girl — just one, mind 
you — can embark on the Nowhere 
Journey as a pilot study and — " 

"But I thought they could make 
the journey only once every sevenhundred-eighty days." 

"Get Congress aroused and you 
can move mountains. It seems the 
expense entailed in a trip at any 
but those times is generally prohibitive, but when something special 
comes up — " 

"It can be done! Mrs. Draper, 
how I love to talk with you ! " 

"See? There you go, my dear, 
counting your chickens. One girl 
will be sent, if the study indicates 
she can take it. One girl, Stephanie, 
and only after a study. She'd merely be a pilot case. But afterwards 
. . . Ah, afterwards . . . Perhaps 
someday soon qualified women will 
be able to join their men in Nowhere." 

"Mrs. Draper, I love you." 

"Naturally, you will tell all this 
to prospective C.E.L. members. 




44 



IMAGINATION 



Now we have something concrete 
to work with." 

"I know. And I will, I will, 
Mrs. Draper. By the way, how 
are they going to pick the girl, the 
one girl?" 

"Don't count your chickens, for 
Heaven's sake! They haven't even 
studied , the situation yet. Well, 
I'll call you, my dear." 

Stephanie hung up, dressed, 
went about her canvassing. She 
thought happy thoughts all week. 

t C QHH ! Quiet," cautioned Arkalion, leading the way down 
a flight of heavy-duty plastic 
stairs. 

"How do you know your way 
around here so well?" 
"I said quiet." 

It was not so much, Temple 
realized, that Arkalion was really 
afraid of making noise. Rather, 
he did not want to answer questions. 

Temple smiled in the semi-darkness, heard the steady drip-dripdrip of water off somewhere to 
his left. Eons before the coming 
of man on this stopover point to 
Nowhere, the Martian waters had 
retreated from the planet's ancient 
surface and seeped underground to 
carve, slow drop by drop, the caverns which honey-combed the 
planet. "You know your way 
around so well, I'd swear you were 
a Martian." 



Arkalion's soft laugh carried 
far. "I said there was to be no 
noise. Please! As for the Martians, the only Martians are here 
all around you, the men of Earth. 
Ahh, here we are." 

At the bottom of the flight of 
stairs Temple could see a door, 
metallic, giving the impression of 
strength without great weight. Arkalion paused a moment, did something with a series of levers, shook 
his head impatiently, started all 
over again. 

"What's that for?" Temple 
wanted to know. 

"What do you think? It is a 
combination lock, with five million possible combinations. Do 
you want to be here for all of eternity?" 

"No." 

"Then quiet." 

Vaguely, Temple wondered why 
the door wasn't guarded. 

"With a lock like this," Arkalion explained, as if he had read 
Temple's thought, "they need no 
other precaution. It is assumed 
that only authorized personnel 
know the combination." 

Then had Arkalion come this 
way before? It seemed the only 
possible assumption. But when? 
And how? "Here we are," said Arkalion. 

The door swung in toward them. 
Temple strode forward, found 
himself in a great bare hall, surpris


VOYAGE TO 

ingly well-lighted. After the dimness of the caverns, he hardly 
could see. 

"Don't stand there scowling and 
fussing with your eyes. There is 
one additional precaution — - an 
alarm at Central Headquarters. 
We have about five minutes, no 
more." 

A T one end of the bare hall 
stood what to Temple looked 
for all the world like an old-fashioned telephone booth, except that 
its walls were completely opaque. 
On the wall adjacent to it was a 
single lever with two positions 
marked "hold" and "transport". 
The lever stood firmly in the 
"hold" position. 

"You sure you want to come?" 
Arkalion demanded. 

"Yes, I told you that." 

"Good. I have no time to explain. I will enter the conveyor." 

"Conveyor?" 

"This booth. You will wait until 
the door is shut, then pull the lever down. That is all there is to it, 
but, as you can see, it is a twoman operation." 

"But how do I—" 

"Haste, haste! There are similar controls at the other end. You 
pull the lever, wait two minutes, 
enter the conveyor yourself. I 
will fetch you — if you are sure." 

"I'm sure, dammit!" 

"Remember, you go without 



ETERNITY 45 

training, without the opportunity 
everyone else has." 

"You already told me that. Mars 
is half-way to eternity. Mars is 
limbo. If I can't go back to Earth 
I want to go — well, to Nowhere. 
There are too many ghosts here, 
too many memories with nothing 
to do." 

Arkalion shrugged, entered the 
booth. "Pull the lever," he said, 
and shut the door. 

Temple reached up, grasped the 
lever firmly in his hand, yanked it. 
It slid smoothly to the position 
marked "transport." Temple heard 
nothing, saw nothing, began to 
think the device, whatever it was, 
did not work. Did Arkalion somehow get moved inside the booth? 

Temple thought he heard footfalls on the stairs outside. Soon, 
faintly, he could hear voices. Someone banged on the door to the hall. 
Licking dry lips, Temple opened 
the booth, peered inside. 

Empty. 

The voices clamored, fists 
pounded on the door. Something 
clicked. Tumblers fell. The door 
to the great, bright hall sprung 
outward. Someone rushed in at 
Temple, who met him savagely 
with a short, chopping blow to his 
jaw. The man, temporarily blinded 
by the dazzling light, stumbled 
back in the path of his fellows. 

Temple darted into the booth, 
the conveyor, and slammed it shut.

Fingers clawed on the outside. 

A sound almost too intense to 
>be heard rang in Temple's ears. 
He lost consciousness instantly. 

CHAPTER VI 

(CXTrHAT a cockeyed world," 
* * said Alaric Arkalion Sr. 
to his son. "You certainly can't 
plan on anything, even if you do 
have more money than you'll ever 
possibly need in a lifetime." 

"Don't feel like that," said 
young Alaric. "I'm not in prison 
any longer, am I?" 

"No. But you're not free of 
the Nowhere Journey, either. 
There is an unheralded special 
trip to Nowhere, two weeks from 
today, I have been informed." 

"Oh?" 

"Yes, oh. I have also been informed that you will be on it. You 
didn't escape after all, Alaric." 

"Oh. Oh!" 

"What bothers me most is that 
scoundrel Smith somehow managed to escape. They haven't 
found him yet, I have also been 
informed. And since my contract 
with him calls for ten million dollars 'for services rendered,' I'll 
have to pay." 

"But he didn't prevent me from 
J? 

"I can't air this thing, Alaric! 
But listen, son: when you go 
where you are going, you're liable 



to find another Alaric Arkalion, 
your double. Of course, that would 
be Smith. If you can get him to 
cut his price in half because of 
what has happened, I would be 
delighted. If you could somehow 
manage to wring his neck, I would 
be even more delighted. Ten million 
dollars — for nothing." 

ttT'M so excited," murmured 
Mrs. Draper. Stephanie 
watched her on one of the new televiewers, recently installed in place 
of the telephone. 
"What is it?" 

"Our bill has been passed by a 
landslide majority in both houses 
of Congress!" 

"Oool" cried Stephanie. 

"Not very coherent, my dear, 
but those are my sentiments exactly. In two weeks there will be a 
Journey to Nowhere, a special one 
which will include, among its passengers, a woman." 

"But the study which had to be 
made — ?" 

"It's already been made. From 
what I gather, they can't take it 
very far. Most of their conclusions had to be based on supposition. The important thing, though, 
is this: a woman will be sent. The 
way the O.E.L. figures it, my 
dear, is that a woman falling in 
the twenty-one to twenty-six age 
group should be chosen, a woman 
who meets all the requirements 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



47 



placed upon the young men." 

"Yes," said Stephanie. "Of 
course. And I was just thinking; 
that I would be — " 

"Remember those chickens!" 
cautioned Mrs. Draper. "We already have one hundred seventyseven volunteers who'd claw each 
other to pieces for a chance to 
go." 

"Wrong," Stephanie said, smiling. "You now have one hundred 
seventy-eight." 

"Room for only one, my dear. 
Only one, you know." 

"Then cross the others off your 
list. I'm already packing my bag." 

TTHEN Temple regained con* » sciousness, it was with the 
feeling that no more than a split 
second of time had elapsed. So 
much had happened so rapidly 
that, until now, he hadn't had time 
to consider it. 

Arkalion had vanished. 

Vanished — he could use no other word. He was there, standing 
in the booth — and then he wasn't. 
Simple as that. Now you see it, 
now you don't. And goodbye, Arkalion. 

But goodbye Temple, too. For 
hadn't Temple entered the same 
booth, waiting but a second until 
Arkalion activated the mechanism 
at the other end? And certainly 
Temple wasn't in the booth now. 
He smiled at the ridiculously sim


ple logic of his thoughts. He stood 
in an open field, the blades of 
grass rising to his knees, as much 
brilliant purple as they were green. 
Waves of the grass, stirred like 
tide by the gentle wind, and hills 
rolling off toward the horizon in 
whichever direction he turned. 
Far away, the undulating hills 
lifted to a half soft mauve sky. 
A somber red sun with twice Sol's 
apparent disc but half its brightness hung midway between zenith 
and horizon completing the picture 
of peaceful other-worldliness. 

Wherever this was, it wasn't 
Earth — or Mars. 

Nowhere? 

Temple shrugged, started walking. He chose his direction at 
random, crushing an easily discernible path behind him in the 
surprisingly brittle grass. The warm 
sun baked his back comfortably, 
the soft-stirring wind caressed his 
cheeks. Of Arkalion he found not 
a trace. 

Two hours later Temple reached 
the hills and started climbing their 
gentle slopes. It was then that 
he saw the figure approaching on 
the run. It took him fully half 
a minute to realize that the runner was not human. 

\ FTER months of weightless 
inactivity, things started to 
happen for Sophia. The feeling of 
weight returned, but weight as she 



IMAGINATION 



never had felt it before. It was 
as- if someone was sitting on every 
inch of her body, crushing her 
down. It made her gasp, forced 
her eyes shut and, although she 
could not see it, contorted her 
face horribly. She lost consciousness, coming to some time later 
with a dreadful feeling of loginess. 
Someone swam into her vision dimly, stung her arm briefly with a 
needle. She slept. 

She was on a table, stretched out, 
with lights glaring down at her. 
She heard voices. 

"The new system is far better 
than testing, comrade." 

"Far more efficient, far more 
objective. Yes." 

"The brain emits electromagnetic vibration. Strange, is it not, 
that no one before ever imagined 
it could tell a story. A completely 
accurate story two years of testing 
could not give us." 

"In Russia we have gone far 
with the biological, psychological 
sciences. The West flies high with 
physics. Give them Mars; bah, 
they can have Mars." 

"True, Comrade. The journey 
to Jupiter is greater, the time consumed is longer, the cost, more 
expensive. But here on Jupiter we 
can do something they cannot do 
on Mars." 

"I know." 

,"We can make supermen. Supermen, comrade. A wedding of 



Nietzsche and Marx." 

"Careful. Those are dangerous 
thoughts." 

"Merely an allusion, comrade. 
Merely a harmless allusion. But 
you take an ordinary human being and train him on Jupiter, 
speeding his time-sense and metabolic rate tremendously with certain endocrine secretions so that 
one day is as a month to him. You 
take him and subject him to big 
Jupiter's pull of gravity, more 
than twice Earth's — and in three 
weeks you have, yes — you have a 
superman." 

"The woman wakes." 

"Shh. Do not frighten her." 

Sophia stretched, every muscle 
in her body aching. Slowly, as in 
a dream, she sat up. It required 
strength, the mere act of pulling 
her torso upright! 

"What have you done to me?" 
she cried, focussing her still-dim 
vision on the two men. 

"Nothing, comrade. Relax." 

Sophia turned slowly on the table, got one long shapely leg 
draped over its edge. 
. "Careful, comrade." 

What were they warning her 
about? She merely wanted to get 
up and stretch; perhaps then she 
would feel better. Her toe touched the floor, she swung her other 
leg over, aware of but ignoring her 
nakedness. 

"A good specimen." 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



"Oh, yes, comrade. So this time 
they send a woman among the 
others. Well, we shall do our work. 
Look — see the way she is formed, 
so lithe, loose-limbed, agile. See 
the toning of the muscles? Her 
beauty will remain, comrade, but 
Jupiter shall make an amazon of 
her." 

SOPHIA had both feet on the 
floor now. She was breathing hard, felt suddenly sick to her 
stomach. Placing both her hands 
on the table edge, she pushed off 
and staggered for two or three 
paces. She crumpled, buckling 
first at the knees then the waist, 
and fell in a writhing heap. 
"Pick her up." 

Hands under her arms, tugging. 
She came off the floor easily, dimly aware that someone carried her 
hundred and thirty pounds effortlessly. "Put me down!" she cried. 
"I want to try again. I am crippled, crippled! You have crippled me ... " 

"Nothing of the sort, comrade. 
You are tired, weak, and Jupiter's 
gravity field is still too strong for 
you. Little by little, though, your 
muscles will strengthen to Jupiter's demands. Gravity will keep 
them from bulging, expanding; but 
every muscle fibre in you will have 
twice, three times its original 
strength. Are you excited?" 

"I am tired and sick. I want 



49 

to sleep. What is Jupiter?" 

"Jupiter is a planet circling the 
sun at — never mind, comrade. You 
have much to learn, but you can 
assimilate it with much less trouble in your sleep. Go ahead, sleep." 

Sophia retched, was sick. It had 
•been years since she cried. But 
naked, afraid, bewildered, she 
cried herself to sleep. 

Things happened while she 
slept, many things. Certain endoctrine extracts accelerated her 
metabolism astonishingly. Within 
half an hour her heart was pumping blood through her body two 
hundred beats per minute. An 
hour later it reached its full rate, 
almost one thousand contractions 
every sixty seconds. All her other 
metabolic functions increased accordingly, and Sophia slept deeply for a week of subjective time — ■ 
in hours. The same machine which 
had gleaned everything from her 
mind far more accurately than a 
battery of tests, a refinement of 
the electro - encephalogram, was 
now played in reverse, giving back 
to Sophia everything it had taken 
plus electrospool after electrospool 
of science, mathematics, logic, economics, history (Marxion, these 
last two), languages (including 
English), semantics and certain 
specialized knowledge she would 
need later on the Stalintrek. 

Still sleeping, Sophia was bathed 
in a warm whirlpool of soothing 



IMAGINATION 



liquid; rubbed, massaged, her 
muscle-toning begun while she 
rested and regained her strength. 
Three hours later, objective time, 
she awoke with a headache and 
with more thoughts spinning 
around madly inside her brain 
than she ever knew existed. Gingerly, she tried standing again, 
lifting herself nude and dripping 
wet from a tub of steaming amber 
stuff. She stood, stretched, permitted her fright to vanish with 
a quick wave of vertigo which engulfed her. She had been fed intravenously, but a tremendous 
hunger possessed her. Before eating, however, she was to find herself in a gymnasium, the air close 
and stifling. She was massaged 
again, told to do certain exercises 
which seemed simple but which 
she found extremely difficult, 
forced to run until she thought 
she would collapse, with her legs, 
dragging like lead. 

She understood, now. Somehow 
she knew she was on Jupiter, the 
fifth and largest planet, where 
the force of gravity is so much 
greater than on Earth that it is 
an effort even to walk. She also 
knew that her metabolic rate had 
been accelerated beyond all comprehension and that in a comparatively short time — objective 
time — she would have thrice her 
original strength. All this she knew 
without knowing how she knew, 



and that was the most staggering 
fact of all. She did what her curt 
instructors bid, then dragged her 
aching muscles and her headache 
into a dining room where tired, 
forlorn-looking men sat around 
eating. Well, the food at least was 
good. Sophia attacked it ravenously. 

TT did not take Temple long to 
realize that the creature running downhill at him, leaving a 
crushed and broken wake in the 
purple and green grass, was not 
human. At first Temple toyed 
with the idea of a man on horseback, for the ceature ran on four 
limbs and had two left over as 
arms. Temple gaped. 

The whole thing was one piece! 

Centaur? 

Hardly. Too small, for one 
thing. No bigger than a man, despite the three pairs of limbs. 
And then Temple had time to 
gape no longer, for the creature, 
whatever it was, flashed past him 
at what he now had to consider a 
gallop. 

More followed. Different. Temple stared and stared. One could 
have been a great, sentient hoop, 
rolling downhill and gathering momentum. If he carried the wheel 
analogy further, a huge eye stared 
at him from where the hub would 
have been. Something else followed with kangaroo leaps. One thick


VOYAGE TO ETERNITY

thewed leg propelled it in tremendous, fifteen-foot hopping strides 
while its small, flapper-like arms 
beat the air prodigiously. 

Legions of creatures. All fantastically different. I'm going 
crazy, Temple thought, then said 
it aloud. "I'm going crazy." 

Theorizing thus, he heard a 
whir overhead, whirled, looked up. 
Something was poised a dozen feet 
off the ground, a large, box-like 
object seven or eight feet across, 
rotors spinning above it. That, at 
least, he could understand. A helicopter. 

"I'm lowering a ladder, Kit. 
Swing aboard." 

Arkalion's voiceT 

Stunned enough to accept anything he saw, Temple waited for 
the rope ladder to drop, grasped 
its end, climbed. He swung his legs 
over a sill, found himself in a 
neat little cabin with Arkalion, 
who hauled the ladder in and did 
something to the controls. They 
sped away. Temple had one quick 
moment of lucid thought before 
everything which had happened in 
the last few moments shoved logic 
aside. What he had observed looked for all the world like a footrace. 

"Where the hell are we?" Temple 
demanded breathlessly. 

Arkalion smiled. "Where do you 
think? Journey's end. Welcome to 
Nowhere, Kit. Welcome to the 



place where all your questions can 
be answered because there's no 
going back. Sorry I set you down 
in that field by mistake, incidentally. Those things sometimes happen." 

"Can I just throw the questions 
at you?" 

"If you wish. It isn't really 
necessary, for you will be indoctrinated when we get you over to 
Earth city where you belong." 

"What do you mean, there's no 
going back? I thought they had 
a rotation system which for one 
reason or another wasn't practical 
at the moment. That doesn't 
sound like no going back, ever." 

Arkalion grunted, shrugged. 
"Have it your way. I know." 

"Sorry. Shoot." 

"Just how far do you think you 
have come?" 

"Search me. Some other star system, maybe?" 

"Maybe. Clean across the galaxy, Kit." 

Temple whistled softly. "It isn't 
something you can grasp just by 
hearing it. Across the galaxy . . ." 

"That isn't too important just 
now. How long did you think the 
journey took?" 

Temple nodded eagerly. "That's 
what gets me. It was amazing, 
Alaric. Really amazing. The whole 
trip couldn't have taken more 
than a moment or two. I don't 
get it. Did we slip out of normal 



IMAGINATION 



space into some other — uh, continuum, and speed across the 
length of the galaxy like that?" 

"The answer to your question is 
yes. But your statement is way 
off. The journey did not take seconds, Kit." 

"No? Instantaneous?" 

"Far more than seconds. To 
reach here from Earth you travelled five thousand years." 

"What?" 

"More correctly, it was five 
thousand years ago that you left 
Mars. You would need a time machine to return, and there is no 
such thing. The Earth you know 
is the length of the galaxy and 
five thousand years behind you." 

CHAPTER VII 

TT could have been a city in New 
England, or maybe Wisconsin. 
Main Street stretched for half a 
mile from Town Hall to the small 
department store. Neon tubing 
brightened every store front, busy 
proprietors could be seen at work 
through the large plate glass windows. There was the bustle you 
might expect on any Main Street 
in New England or Wisconsin, but 
you could not draw the parallel 
indefinitely. 

There were only men. No 
women. 

The hills in which the town 
nestled were too purple — not pur


ple with distance but the natural 
color of the grass. 

A somber red sun . hung in the 
pale mauve sky. 

This was Earth City, Nowhere. 

Arkalion had deposited Temple 
in the nearby hills, promised they 
would see one another again. "It 
may not be so soon," Arkalion had 
said, "but what's the difference? 
You'll spend the rest of your life 
here. You realize you are lucky, 
Kit. If , you hadn't come, you 
would have been dead these five 
thousand years. Well, good luck." 

Dead — five thousand years. 
The Earth as he knew it, dust. 
Stephanie, a fifty generation 
corpse. Nowhere was right. End 
of the universe. 

Temple shuffled his feet, trudged on into town. A man passed 
him on the street, stooped, grayhaired. The man nodded, did a 
mild double-take. I'm an unfamiliar face, Temple thought. 

"Howdy," he said. "I'm new 
here." 

"That's what I thought, stranger. Know just about everyone in 
these here parts, I do, and I said 
to myself, now there's a newcomer. Funny you didn't come in the 
regular way." 

"I'm here," said Temple. 

"Yeah. Funny thing, you get to 
know everyone. Eh, what you say 
your name was?" 

"Christopher Temple." 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



S3 



"Make it my business to know 
everyone. The neighborly way, I 
always say. Temple, eh? We have 
one here." 

"One what?" 

"Another fellow name of Temple. Jase Temple, son." 

"I'll be damned!" Temple cried, 
smiling suddenly. "I will be 
damned. Tell me, old timer, where 
can I find him?" 

"Might be anyplace. Town's 
bigger'n it looks. I tell you, 
though, Jase Temple's our coordinator . You'll find him there, the 
co-ordinator's office. Town Hall, 
down the end of the street." 

"I already passed it," Temple 
told the old man. "And thanks." 

Temple's legs carried him at a 
brisk pace, past the row of store 
fronts and down to the Town 
Hall. He read a directory, climbed 
a flight of stairs, found a door 
marked: 

JASON TEMPLE 

Earth City Co-ordinator 

Heart pounding, Temple knocked, heard someone call, "Come in." 

He pushed the door in and stared at his brother, just rising to 
face him. 

CtT^IT! Kit! What are you doing . . . so you took the 
journey too!" 

Jason ran to him, clasped his 
shoulders, pounded them. "You 
sure are looking fit. Kit, you 



could have knocked me over with 
half a feather, coming in like 
that." 

"You're looking great too, 
Jase," Temple lied. He hadn't 
seen his brother in five years, had 
never expected to see him again. 
But he remembered a full-faced, 
smiling man somewhat taller than 
himself, somewhat broader across 
the shoulders. The Jason he sawlooked forty-five or fifty but was 
hardly out of his twenties. He had 
fierce, smouldering eyes, gaunt 
cheeks, graying hair. He seemed 
a bundle of restless, nervous 
energy. 

"Sit down, Kit. Start talking, 
kid brother. Start talking and 
don't stop till next week. Tell me 
everything. Everything! Tell me 
about the blue sky and the moon 
at night and the way the ocean 
looks on a windy day and . . ." 

"Five years," said Temple. 
"Five years." 

"Five thousand, you mean," 
Jason reminded him. "It hardly 
seems possible. How are the folks, 
Kit?" 

"Mom's fine. Pop too. He's 
sporting a new Chambers Converto. You should see him, Jase. 
Sharp." 

"And Ann?" Jason looked at 
'him hopefully. Ann had been Jason's Stephanie — but for the Nowhere Journey they would have 
married. 



54 



IMAGINATION 



"Ann's married," -Temple said. 

"Oh. Oh. That's swell, Kit. 
Really swell. I mean, what the 
hell, a girl shouldn't wait forever. 
I told her not to, anyway." 

"She waited four years, then 
met a guy and — " 

"A nice guy?" 

"The best," said Temple. 
"You'd like him." 

Temple saw the vague hurt 
come to Jason's smouldering eyes. 
Then it was the same. One part 
of Jason wanted her to remain 
his over an unthinkable gap, another part wanted her to live a 
good, full life. 

"I'm glad," said Jason. "Can't 
expect a girl to wait without 
hope . . ." 

"Then there's no hope we'll 
ever get back?" 

Jason laughed harshly. "You 
tell me. Earth isn't merely sixty 
thousand light years away. Kit, 
do you know what a light year is " 

Temple said he thought he did. 

"Sixty thousand of them. A 
dozen eternities. But the Earth 
we know is also dead. Dead five 
thousand years. The folks, Center 
City, Ann, her husband — all dust. 
Five thousand years old . . . 
Don't mind me, Kit." 

"Sure. Sure, I understand." But 
Temple didn't, not really. You 
couldn't take five thousand years 
and chuck them out the window 
in what seemed the space of a 



heart beat and then realize they 
were gone permanently, forever. 
Not a period of time as long as all 
of recorded civilization — you 
couldn't take it, tack it on after 
1992 and accept it. Somehow, 
Temple realized, the five thousand 
years were harder to swallow than 
the sixty thousand light years. 

"Well," with a visible effort, 
Jason snapped out of his reverie. 
Temple accepted a cigarette gratefully, his first in a long time. In 
fifty centuries, he thought bitterly, burrowing deeper into a funk. 

"Well," said Jason, "I'm acting 
like a prize boob. How selfish can 
I get? There must be an awful 
lot you'd like to know, Kit." 

"That's all right. I was told I'd 
be indoctrinated." 

"Ordinarily, you would. But 
there's no shipment now, none for 
another three months. Say, how 
the devil did you get here?" 

"That's a long story. Nowhere 
Journey, same as you, with a 
little assist to speed things up on 
Mars. Jase, tell me this: what are 
we doing here? What is everyone 
doing here? What's the Nowhere 
Journey all about? What kind of 
a glorified foot-race did I see a 
while ago, with a bunch of creatures out of the telio science-fiction shows?" 

JASON put his own cigarette 
out, changed his mind, lit an


VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



55 



other one. "Sort of like the old 
joke, where does an alien go to 
register?" 
"Sort of." 

"It's a big universe," said Jason, evidently starting at the beginning of something. 

"I'm just beginning to learn how 
big!" 

"It would be pretty unimaginative of mankind to consider itself 
the only sentient form of life, 
Earth the only home of intelligence, both from a scientific and a 
religious point of view. We kind 
of expected to find — neighbors out 
in space. Kit, the sky is full of 
stars, most stars have planets. 
The universe crawls with life, 
all sorts of life, all sorts of 
intelligent life. In short, we 
are not alone. It would be sort of 
like taking the jet-shuttle from 
Washington to New York during 
the evening rush and expecting to 
be the only one aboard. In reality, you're lucky to get breathing 
space. 

"There are biped intelligences, 
like humans. There are radial intelligences, one-legged species, tall, 
gangling creatures, squat ones, 
pancake ones, giants, dwarfs. 
There are green skins and pink 
skins and coal black — and yes, no 
skins. There are . . . but you get 
the idea." 

"Uh-huh." 

"Strangely enough, most of these 



intelligences are on about the same 
developmental level. It's as if the 
Creator turned everything on at 
once, like a race, and said 'okay, 
guys get started.' Maybe it's because, as scientists figure, the 
whole universe got wound up and 
started working as a unit. I don't 
know. Anyway, that's the way it 
is. All the intelligences worth 
talking about are on about the 
same cultural level. Atomics, crude 
spaceflight, wars they can't handle. 

"And this is interesting, Kit. 
Most of 'em are bipedal. Not 
really human, not fully human. 
You can see the difference. But 
seventy-five percent of the races 
I've encountered have had basic 
similarities. A case of the Creator 
trying to figure out the best of 
all possible life-patterns and coming up with this one. Offers a wide 
range for action, for adaptation, 
stuff like that. Anyway, I'm losing track of things." 

"Take it easy. From what you 
tell me I have all the time in the 
world." 

"Well, I said all the races are 
developmen tally parallel. That's 
almost true. One of them is not. 
One of them is so far ahead that 
the rest of us have hardly reached 
the crawling stage by comparison. 
One of them is the Super Race, 
Kit. 

"Their culture is old, incredibly 
old. So old, in fact, that some of 



IMAGINATION 



us figure it's been hanging around 
since before the Universe took 
shape. Maybe that's why all the 
others are on one level, a few thousand million years behind the Super Race. 

"So, take this Super Race. For 
some reason we can't understand, 
it seems to be on the skids. That's 
just figurative. Maybe it's dying 
out, maybe it wants to pack up 
and leave the galaxy altogether, 
maybe it's got other undreamed of 
business other undreamed of places. 
Anyway, it wants out. But it's 
got an eon-old storehouse of culture and maybe it figures someone ought to have access to that 
and keep the galaxy in running order. But Who? That's the problem. Who gets all this information, a million million generations 
of scientific problems, all carefully worked out? Who, among 
all the parallel races on all the 
worlds of the Universe? That's 
quite a problem, even for our Super Race boys. 

"You'd think they'd have ways 
to solve it, though. With calculating machines or whatever will 
follow calculating machines after 
Earthmen and all the others find 
the next faltering step after a few 
thousand years. Or with plain 
horse sense and logic, developed 
to a point — after millions of years 
at it — where it never fails. Or 
solve the problem with something 



we've never heard of, but solve 
it anyway." 

"What's all this got to do 
with — ? I mean, it's an interesting story and when I get a chance 
to digest it I'll probably start gasping, but what about Nowhere and 

"I'm coming to that. Kit, what 
would you say if I told you that 
the most intelligent race the Universe has ever produced solves the 
biggest problem ever handed anyone — by playing games?" 

CtT'D say you better continue." 

"That's the purpose of Nowhere, Kit. Every planet, every 
race has its Nowhere. We all come 
here and we play games. Planet 
with the highest score at the end of 
God knows how long wins the Universe, with all the science and the 
wisdom needed to fashion that 
universe into a dozen different 
kinds of heaven. And to decide 
all this, we play games. 

"Don't get the wrong idea. I'm 
not complaining. If the Superboys say we play, then we play. 
I'd take their word for it if they 
told me I had fifteen heads. But 
it's the sort of thing which doesn't let you get much sleep. Oh, 
Earth has a right to be proud of 
its record. United North America 
is in second place on a competition 
that's as wide as the Universe. 
But we're not first. Second. And I 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



57 



have a hunch from what's been 
going on around here that the 
games are drawing to a close. 

"Fantastic, isn't it? Out of thousands of entrants, we're good 
enough to place second. But some 
planet out near the star Deneb 
has us hopelessly outclassed. We 
might as well get the booby prize. 
They'll win and own the Universe 
■ — us included." 

Jason had leaned forward as he 
spoke, and was sitting on the edge 
of his chair now. The room was 
comfortably cool, but sweat beaded his forehead, dripped from his 
chin. 

Temple lit another cigarette, inhaling deeply. "You said the 
United States — North America — 
was second. I thought this was a 
planet-wide competition, planet 
against planet." 

"Earth is the one exception I've 
been able to find. The Deneb 
planet heads the list, then comes 
North America. After that, the 
planet of a star I never heard of. 
In fourth place is the Soviet Union." 

"I'll be damned," said Temple. 
"Well, okay. Mind if I store that 
away for future reference? I've 
got another question. What kind 
of — uh, games do we play?" 

"You name it. Mental contests. 
Scientific problems to be worked 
out with laboratories built to our 
specifications. Emotional prob


lems with scores of men driven 
neurotic or worse every year. 
Problems of adaptability. Responses to environmental challenge. Stamina contests. Tests 
of strength, of endurance. Tests 
to determine depths of emotion. 
Tests to determine objectivity in 
what should be an objective situation. But the way everything is 
organized it's almost like a giantsized, never ending Olympic 
Games, complete with some cockeyed sports events too, by the 
way." 

"With all the pageantry, too?" 

"No. But that's another story." 

"Anyway, what I saw was a 
foot-race"! And sorry, Jase, but 
I have another question." 

Jason shrugged, spread his hands 
wide. 

"How come all this talk about 
rotation? It isn't possible, not 
with a fifty century gap." 

"I know. They just let us in 
on that little deal a couple of 
years ago. Till then, we didn't 
know. We thought it was distance 
only. In time, after all this was 
over, we could go home. That's 
what we thought," Jason said bitterly. "Actually, it's twice five 
thousand years. Five to come here, 
five to return. Ten thousand years 
separate us from the Earth we 
know, and even if we could go 
home, that wouldn't be going home 
at all— to Earth ten thousand 



IMAGINATION 



years in the future. 

"Oh, they had us hoodwinked. 
Afraid we might say no or something. They never mentioned the 
length or duration of the trip. I 
don't understand it, none of us do 
and we have some top scientists 
here. Something to do with suspended animation, with contraterrene matter, with teleportation, 
something about latent extra-sensory powers in everyone, about the 
ability to break down an objector a creature or a man — to its 
component atoms, to reversethat 's the word, reverse — ■ those 
atoms and send them spinning off 
into space as contra-terrene. matter. 

"It all boils down to putting a 
man in a machine on Mars, pulling 
a lever, materializing him here 
five thousand years later." Jason 
smiled with only a trace of humor, 
"Any questions?" 

"About a thousand," said Temple. "I—" 

SOMETHING buzzed on Jason's desk and Temple watched him pick up a microphone, say: 
"Co-ordinator speaking. What's 
up?" 

The voice which answered, clear 
enough to be in the room with 
them and without the faintest trace 
of mechanical or electrical transfer, spoke in a strange, liquid-syllabled language Temple had never 



heard. Jason responded in the 
same language, with an apparent 
ease which surprised Temple — 
until he remembered that his 
brother had always had a knack 
of picking up foreign languages. 
Maybe that was why he held the 
Co-ordinator's job — whatever it was 
he co-ordinated. 

There was fluency in the way 
Jason spoke, and alarm. The 
trouble-lines etched deeply on his 
face stood out sharply, his eyes, 
if possible, grew more intense. 
"Well," he said, putting the mike 
down and staring at Temple without seeing him, "I'm afraid that 
does it." 

"What's the trouble?" 

"Everything." 

"Anything I can do?" 

"Item. The Superboys have 
discovered that Earth has two 
contingents here — us and the Soviets. They're mad. Item. Something will be done about it. Item. 
Soviet Russia has made a suggestion, or that is, its people here. 
They will put forth a champion to 
match one of our own choosing in 
the toughest grind of all, something to do with responding to environmental challenge, which doesn't mean a hell of a lot unless you 
happen to know something about 
it. Shall I go on?" 

And, when Temple nodded avidly. "We automatically lose by default. One of the rules of that 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



59 



particular game is that the contestant must be a newcomer. It's 
the sort of game you have to know 
nothing about, and incidentally, 
it's also the sort of game a man 
can get killed at. Well, the Soviets 
have a whole contingent of newcomers to pick from. We don't 
have any. As the Superboys see 
it, that's our own tough luck. We 
lose by default." 

"It seems to me — " 

"How can anything 'seem to 
you?' You're new here . . . I'm 
sorry Kit. What were you saying?" 

"No. Go ahead." 

"That's only the half of it. 
Right after Russia takes our place 
and we're scratched off the list, 
the games go into their final phase. 
That was the rumor all along, and 
it's just been confirmed. Interesting to see what they do with all 
the contestants after the games 
are over, after there's no more Nowhere Journey." 

"We could go back where we 
came from." 

"Ten thousand years in the future?" 

"I'm not afraid." 

"Well, anyway, the Soviets put 
up a man, we can't match him. So 
it looks like the U.S.S.R. represents Earth officially. Not that 
it matters. We hardly have the 
chance of a very slushy snowball 
in a very hot hell. But still — " 



"Our contestant, this guy who 
meets the Russian's challenge, has 
to be a newcomer?" 

"That's what I said. Well, we 
can close up shop, I guess." 

"You made a mistake. You said 
no newcomers have arrived. I'm 
here, Jase. I'm your man. Bring 
on your Russian Bear." Temple 
smiled grimly. 

CHAPTER VIII 

a^TOV got to hand it to Tem* pie's kid brother." 

"Yeah. Cool as ice cubes." 

"Are you guys kidding? He 
doesn't know what's in store for 
him, that's all." 

"Do you?" 

"Now that you mention it, no. 
Isn't a man here who can say for 
sure what kind of environmental 
challenges he'll have to respond to. 
Hypno-surgery sees to it the guys 
who went through the thing won't 
talk about it. As if that isn't security enough, the subject's got 
to be a brand new arrival ! " 

"Shh! Here he comes." 

The brothers Temple entered 
Earth City's one tavern quietly, 
but on their arrival all the speculative talk subsided. The long bar, 
built to accommodate half a hundred pairs of elbows comfortably, 
gleamed with a luster unfamiliar 
to Temple. It might have been 
marble, but marble translucent

rather than opaque, giving a beautiful three-dimensional effect to 
the surface patterns. 

"What will it be?" Jason demanded. 

"Whatever you're drinking is 
fine." 

Jason ordered two scotches, 
neat, and the brothers drank. When 
Jason got a refill he started talking. "Does T.A.T. mean anything 
to you, Kit?" 

"Tat? Umm — no. Wait a 
minute! T.A.T. Isn't that some 
kind of projective psychological 
test?" 

"That's it. You're shown a 
couple of dozen pictures, more or 
less ambiguous, never cut and dry. 
Each one comes from a different 
stratum of the social environment, 
and you're told to create a dramatic situation, a story, for each 
picture. From your stories, for 
which you draw on your whole 
background as a human being, the 
psychometrician should be able to 
build a picture of your personality 
and maybe find out what, if anything, is bothering you." 

"What's, that to do with this 
response to environmental challenge thing?" 

"Well," said Jason, drinking a 
third scotch, "the Super Boys have 
evolved T.A.T. to its ultimate. 
T.A.T. — that stands for Thematic 
Apperception Test. But in E.C.R. 
— environmental challenge and re


sponse, you don't see a picture and 
create a dramatic story around it. 
Instead, you get thrust into the 
picture, the situation, and you 
have to work out the solution — or 
suffer whatever consequences the 
particular environmental challenge 
has in store for you." 

"I think I get you. But it's all 
make believe, huh?" 

"That's the hell of it," Jason 
told him. "No, it's not. It is and 
it isn't. I don't know." 

"You make it perfectly clear," 
Temple smiled. "The red-headed 
boy combed his brown hair, wishing 
it weren't blond." 

Jason shrugged. "I'm sorry. 
For reasons you already know, the 
E.C.R. isn't very clear to me — or to 
anyone. You're not actually in the 
situation in a physical sense, but 
it can affect you physically. You 
feel you're there, you actually live 
everything that happens to you, 
getting injured if an injury occurs 
. . . and dying if you get killed. 
It's permanent, although you might 
actually be sleeping at the time. 
So, whether it's real or not is a 
question for philosophy. From 
your point of view, from the point 
of view of someone going through 
it, it's real." 

"So I become part of this — uh, 
game in about an hour." 

"Right. You and whoever the 
Russians offer as your competition. 
No one will blame you if you want 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



61 



to back out, Kit; from 'what you 
tell me, you haven't even been adequately trained on Mars." 

"If you draw on the entire background of your life for this E.C.R., 
then you 'don't need training. 
Shut up and stop worrying. I'm 
not backing out of anything." 

"I didn't think you would, not 
if you're still as much like your 
old man as you used to-be. Kit... 
good luck." 

npHE fact that the technicians 
A working around him were 
Earthmen permitted Temple to relax a little. Probably, it was planned that way, for entering the huge 
white cube of a building and ascending to the twelfth level on a 
moving ramp Temple had spotted 
many figures, not all of them human. If he had been strapped to 
the table by unfamiliar aliens, if 
•the scent of alien flesh — or nonflesh — ■ had been strong in the 
room, if the fingers — or appendages — which greased his temples 
and clamped an electrode to each 
one had not felt like human fingers, if the men talking to him had 
spoken in voices too harsh or too 
sibilant for human vocal chords— 
if all that had been the case whatever composure still remained his 
would have vanished. 

"I'm Dr. Olson," said one whitegowned figure. "If any injuries 
occur while you lie here, I'm per


mitted to render first aid." 

"The same for limited psychotherapy," said a shorter, heavier 
man. "Though a fat lot of good 
it does when we never know what's 
bothering you, and don't have the 
time to work on it even if we did 
know." 

"In short," said a third man who 
failed to identify himself, "you 
may consider yourself as the driver of one of those midget rocket 
racers. Do they still have them on 
Earth? Good. You are the driver, and we here in this room are 
the mechanics waiting in your pit. 
If anything goes wrong, you can 
pull out of the race temporarily 
and have it repaired. But in this 
particular race there is no pulling 
out: all repairs are strictly of a 
first-aid nature and must be done 
while you continue whatever you 
are doing. If you break your finger and find a splint appearing on 
it miraculously, don't say you 
weren't warned." 

"Best of luck to you, young 
man," said the psycho-therapist. 

"Here we go," said the doctor, 
finding the large vein on the inside 
of Temple's forearm and plunging 
a needle into it. 

Temple's senses whirled instantly, but as his vision clouded he 
thought he saw a large, wmplex 
device swing down from the ceiling 
and bathe his head in warming radiation. He blinked, squinted, 



IMAGINATION 



could see nothing but a swirling, 
cloudy opacity. 

\ PP ROXIM ATELY two seconds later, Sophia Androvna 
Petrovitch watched as the whitegowned comrade tied a rubber 
strap around her arm, waited for 
the vein to swell with blood, then 
forced a needle in through its thick 
outer layer. Was that a nozzle 
overhead? No, rather a lens, for 
from it came amber warmth . . . 
which soon faded, with everything 
else, into thick, churning fog . . . 

Temple was abruptly aware of 
running, plunging headlong and 
blindly through the fiercest storm 
he had ever seen. Gusts of wind 
whipped at him furiously. Rain 
cascaded down in drenching torrents. Foliage, brambles, branches struck against his face; mud 
sucked at his feet. Big animal' 
shapes lumbered by in the green 
gloom, as frightened by the storm 
as was Temple. 

His head darted this way and 
that, his eyes could see the gnarled tree trunks, the dense greenery, 
the lianas, creepers and vines of a 
tropical rain forest — but dimly. 
Green murk swirled in like thick 
smoke with every gust of wind, 
with the rain obscuring vision almost completely. 

Temple ran until his lungs 
burned and he thought he must 
exhale fire. His leaden feet 



fought the mud with growing difficulty for every stride he took. 
He ran wildly and in no set direction, convinced only that he must 
find shelter or perish. Twice he 
crashed bodily into trees, twice 
stumbled to his knees only to pull 
himself upright again, sucking air 
painfully into his lungs and cutting out in a fresh direction. 

He ran until his legs balked. He 
fell, collapsing first at the knees, 
then the waist, then flopping face 
down in the mud. Something prodded his back as he fell and reaching behind him weakly Temple was 
aware for the first time that a 
bow and a quiver of arrows hung 
suspended from his shoulders by 
a strong leather thong. He wore 
nothing but a loin cloth of some 
nameless animal skin and he wondered idly if he had slain the animal with the weapon he carried. 
Yet when he tried to recollect he 
found he could not. He remembered nothing but his frantic flight 
through the rain forest, as if all 
his life he had run in a futile attempt to leave the rain behind him. 

Now as he lay there, the mud 
sucking at his legs, his chest, his 
armpits, he could not even remember his name. Did he have one? 
Did he have a life before the rain 
forest? Then why did he forget? 

A sense not fully developed in 
man and called intuition by those 
who fail to understand it made

him prop his head up on his hands 
and squint through the downpour. 
There was something off there in 
the foliage . . . someone . . . 
A woman. 

Temple's breath caught in his 
throat sharply. The woman stood 
half a dozen paces off, observing 
him coolly with hands on flanks. 
She stood tall and straight despite the storm and from trim ankles to long, lithe legs to flaring 
loin-clothed hips, to supple waist 
and tawny skin of fine bare breasts 
and shoulders, to proud, haughty 
face and long dark hair loose in 
the storm and glistening with rain, 
she. was magnificent. Her long, 
bronzed body gleamed with wetness and Temple realized she was 
tall as he, a wild beautiful goddess 
of the jungle. She was part of the 
storm and he accepted her — but 
strangely, with the same fear the 
storm evoked. She would make a 
lover the whole world might relish (what world, Temple thought 
in confusion?) but she would make 
a terrible foe. 

And foe she was . . . 

"I want your bow and arrows," 
she told him. 

'TpEMPLE wanted to suggest 
they share the weapon, but 
somehow he knew in this world 
which was like a dream and could 
tell him things the way a dream 
would and yet was vividly real, 



ETERNITY 63 

that the woman would share nothing with anybody. 

"They are mine," Temple said, 
climbing to his knees. He remembered the animal-shapes lumbering 
by in the storm and he knew that 
he and the animals would both 
stalk prey when the storm subsided 
and he would need the bow and 
arrows. 

The woman moved toward him 
with a liquid motion beautiful to 
behold, and for the space of a 
heartbeat Temple watched her 
come. "I will take them," she 
said. 

Temple wasn't sure if she could 
or not, and although she was a 
woman he feared her strangely. 
Again, it was as if something in 
this dream-world real-world could 
tell him more than he should know. 

Making up his mind, Temple 
sprang to his feet, whirled about 
and ran. He was plunging through 
the wild storm once more, blinded 
by the occasional flashes of jagged 
green lightning, deafened by the 
peals of thunder which followed. 
And he was being pursued. 

Minutes, hours, more than hours 
— for an eternity Temple ran. A reservoir of strength he never knew he 
possessed provided the energy for 
each painful step and running 
through the storm seemed the most 
natural thing in the world to him. 
But there came a time when his 
strength failed, not slowly, but 



6 4 



IMAGINATION 



with shocking suddenness. Temple 
fell, crawled a ways, was still. 

It took him minutes to realize 
the storm no longer buffeted him, 
more minutes to learn he had managed to crawl into a cave. He 
had no time to congratulate himself on his good fortune, for something stirred outside. 

"I am coming in," the woman 
called to him from the green murk. 

Temple strung an arrow to his 
bow, pulled the string back and 
faced the cave's entrance squatting 
on his heels. "Then your first 
step shall be your last. I'll shoot 
to kill." And he meant it. 

Silence from outside. Deafening. 

Temple felt sweat streaming 
under his armpits; his hands were 
clammy, his hands trembled. 

"You haven't seen the last of 
me," the woman promised. After 
that, Temple knew she was gone. 
He slept as one dead. 

When Temple awoke, bright 
sunlight filtered in through the 
foliage outside his cave. Although 
the ground was a muddy ruin, the 
storm had stopped. Edging to the 
mouth of the cave, Temple spread 
the foliage with his hands, peered 
cautiously outside. Satisfied, he 
took his bow and arrows and left 
the cave, pangs of hunger knotting 
his stomach painfully. 

The cave had been weathered in 
the side of a short, steep abutment 
a dozen paces from a gushing, swol


len stream. Temple followed the 
course of the stream as it twisted 
through the jungle, ranging half 
a mile from his cave until the water course widened to form a water-hole. All morning Temple 
waited there, crouching in the 
grass, until one by one, the forest 
animals came to drink. He selected a small hare-like thing, notched 
an arrow to his <bow, let it fly. 

The animal jumped, collapsed, 
began to slink away into the undergrowth, dragging the arrow 
from its hindquarters. Temple 
darted after it, caught it in his 
hands and bashed its life out 
against the bole of a tree. Returning to his cave he found two 
flinty stones, shredded a fallen 
branch and nursed the shards dry 
in. the strong sunlight. Soon he 
made a fire and ate. 

TN the days which followed, 
-*- Temple returned to the waterhole and bagged a new catch every 
time he ventured forth. Things 
went so well that he began to range 
further and further from his cave 
exploring. Once however, he returned early to the water-hole and 
found footprints in the soft mud of 
its banks. 
The woman. 

That she had been observing 
him while he had hunted had never occurred to Temple, but now 
that the proof lay clearly before 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



65 



his eyes, the old feeling of uncertainty came back. And the next 
day, when he crept stealthily to 
the water-hole and saw the woman 
squatting there in the brush, waiting for him, he fled back to his 
cave. 

The thought hit him suddenly. 
If she were stalking him, why 
must he flee as from his own shadow? There would be no security 
for either of them until either one 
or the other were gone— and gone 
meant dead. Then Temple would 
do his own stalking. 

For several nights Temple hardly slept. He could have found the 
water-hole blindfolded merely by 
following the stream. Each night 
he would reach the hole and work, 
digging with a sharp stone, until 
he had fashioned a pit fully ten 
feet deep and six feet across. This 
he covered with branches, twigs, 
leaves and finally dirt. 

When he returned in the morning he was satisfied with his work. 
Unless the woman made a careful 
study of the area, she would never 
see the pit. All that day Temple 
waited with his back to the water-hole, facing the camouflaged 
pit, the trap he had set, but the 
woman failed to appear. When she 
also did not come on the second 
day, he began to think his plan 
would not work. 

The third day, Temple arrived 
with the sun, sat as before in the 



tall grass between the pit and the 
water j hole and waited. Several 
paces beyond his hidden trap he 
could see the tall trees of the jungle with vines and creepers hanging from their branches. At his 
back, a man's length behind him 
was the water-hole, its deepest 
waters no more than waist-high. 

Temple waited until the sun 
stood high in the sky, then was fascinated as a small antelope minced 
down to the water-hole for a drink. 
You'll make a fine breakfast tomorrow, he thought, smiling. 

Something, that strange sixth 
sense again, made Temple turn 
around and stand up. He had 
time for a brief look, a hoarse cry. 

The woman had been the cleverer. She had set the final trap. 
She stood high up on a branch of 
one of the trees beyond the hidden pit and for an instant Temple 
saw her fine figure clearly, naked 
but for the loincloth. Then the 
soft curves became spring-steel. 

The woman arched her body there 
on the high branch, grasping a 
stout vine and rocking back with 
it. Temple raised his bow, set an 
arrow to let it fly. But by then, 
the woman was in motion. 

Long and lithe and graceful, she 
swung down on her vine, gathering momentum as she came. Her 
feet almost brushed the lip of 
Temple's pit at the lowest arc of 
her flight, but she clung to the 



66 



IMAGINATION 



vine and it began to swing up 
again like a pendulum — toward 
Temple. 

At the last moment he hunched 
his shoulder and tried to raise his 
arms for protection. The woman 
was quicker. She gathered her legs 
up under her, still clutching the vine 
with her slim, strong hands. The 
vine's arc carried her up at him; 
her knees were at a level with his 
head and she brought them up savagely, close together striking Temple brutally at the base of his jaw< 
Temple screamed as his head was 
jerked back with terrible force. 

The bow flew from his fingers 
and he fell into the water-hole, 
flat on his back. 

Sophia let the vine carry her 
out over the water, then dropped 
from it. Waist deep, she waded to 
where the man lay, unconscious on 
his back, half in, half out of the 
shallowest part of the water. She 
reached him, prodded his chest 
with her foot. When he did not stir, 
she rocked her weight down gracefully on her long leg, forcing his 
head under water. With a haughty 
smile, she watched the bubbles 
rise . . . 

TN the small room where Tem■*■ pie's body lay in repose on a 
table the white-smocked doctor 
looked at the psychotherapist 
questioningly. "What's happening?" 



"Can't tell, doctor. But—" 

Suddenly Temple's still body rocked convulsively, his neck stretched, 
his head shot up and back. Blood 
trickled from his mouth. 

The doctor thrust out expert 
hands, examined Temple's jaw dexterously. 

"Broken?" the psychotherapist 
demanded in a worried voice. 

"No. Dislocated. He looks 
like he's been hit by a sledge 
hammer, wherever he is now, whatever's happening. This E.C.R. is the 
damndest thing." 

Temple's still form shuddered 
convulsively. He began to gasp 
and cough, obviously fighting for 
breath. An ugly blue swelling had 
by now lumped the base of his 
jaw. 

"What's happening?" demanded 
the psychotherapist. 

"I can't be sure," said the doctor, shaking his head. "He seems 
to have difficulty in breathing . . . 
it's as if he were — drowning." 

"Bad. Anything we can do?" 

"No. We wait until this particular sequence ends." The doctor 
examined Temple again. "If it 
doesn't end soon, this man will 
die of asphyxiation." 

"Call it off," the psychotherapist 
pleaded. "If he dies now Earth 
will be represented by Russia. 
Call it off! " 

Someone entered the room. "/ 
have the authority," he said, se

67 



lecting a hypodermic from the doctor's rack and piercing the skin of 
Temple's forearm with it. "This 
first test has gone far enough. 
The Russian eh try is clearly the 
winner, but Temple must live if 
he is to compete in another." 

The wracking convulsions which 
shook Temple's body subsided. He 
ceased his choking, began to 
breathe regularly. With grim 
swiftness, the doctor went to work 
on Temple's dislocated jaw while 
the man who had stopped the 
contest rendered artificial respirtion. 

The man was Alaric Arkalion. 

THE Comrade Doctor was exultant. "Jupiter training, 
comrade, has given us a victory." 
"How can you be sure?" 
"Our entrant is unharmed, the 
contest has been called. Wait . . . 
she is coming to." 

Sophia stretched, rubbed her 
bruised knees, sat up. 

"What happened, Comrade?" 
the doctor demanded. 

"My knees ache," said Sophia, 
rubbing them some more. "I — I 
killed him, I think. Strange, I 
never dreamed it would be that 
real." 

"In a sense, it was real. If you 
killed the American, he will stay 
dead." 

"Nothing mattered but that 
world we were in, a fantastic 



place. Now I remember everything, all the things I couldn't remember then." 

"But your — ah, dream — what 
happened?" 

Sophia rubbed her bruised knees 
a third time, ruefully. "I knocked him unconscious with these. I 
forced his head under water and 
drowned him. But — before I 
could be sure I finished the job — 
I came back . . . Funny that I 
should want to kill him without 
compunction, without reason." 
Sophia frowned, sat up. "I don't 
think I want anymore of this." 

The doctor surveyed her coldly. 
"This is your task on the Stalintrek. This you will do." 

"I killed him without a thought." 

"Enough. You will rest and 
get ready for the second contest." 

"But if he's dead—" 

"Apparently he's not, or we 
would have been informed, Comrade Petrovitch." 

"That is true," agreed the second 
man, who had remained silent until now. "Prepare for another 
test, Comrade." 

Sophia was on the point of arguing again. After all it wasn't 
fair. If in the dream-worlds which 
were not dream worlds she was 
motivated by but one factor and 
that to destroy the American and 
if she faced him with the strength 
of her Jupiter training it would 
hardly be a contest. And now that

she could think of the American 
without the all-consuming hatred 
the dream world had fostered in 
her, she realized he had been a 
pkasant-looking young man, quite 
personable, in fact. / could like 
him, Sophia thought and hoped 
fervently she had not drowned him. 
Still, if she had volunteered for 
the Stalintrek and this was the 
job they assigned her . . . 

"I need no rest," she told the 
doctor, hardly trusting herself, for 
she realized she might change her 
mind. "I am ready any time you 
are." 

CHAPTER IX 

TTIS name was Temple and it 
was the year i960. Hectic 
end of a decade, i960. Ancient 
Joe Stalin was still alive, drugged 
half senseless against the tortures 
of an incurable stomach cancer, although the world thought he died in 
1953. He would hang on grimly another year and a half, yielding the 
reins of empire to stout Malenkov 
who in the space of a few years 
would lose them to a crafty schoolteacherish whiplash called Beria. 
i960 — eleventh year of the fantastic Korean situation, in which the 
Land of the Morning Sun had become, with no pretentions to the 
contrary, a glorified training camp 
for the armies of both sides. 
The Cold War flared, hot in Bur


ma by mid-1960. Indo-China was 

a Red Fortress and with Tibet 
hopelessly behind the Iron Curtain, India awoke to the fact that 
neutrality was an impossibility in 
the era of pushbuttonry, lending 
her chaotic bulk to the West. Mao 
Tse Tung fell before an assassin's 
bullet in Peking, but a shining 
new political sewage system cleared 
the streets of celebration before it 
fairly got under way. Inside of 
forty-eight hours, China had a 
new Red boss • — imported from 
Moscow. 

For some reason, it took until 
i960 for the first batch of Hiroshima-Nagasaki mutants not to 
miscarry, and Sunday Supplement 
editors had a field day with the 
pathetic little creatures, one of 
which was born with two heads 
and actually survived for ten years. 
In i960 the first manned spaceship 
reached Luna, but the public knew 
nothing of this for another fourteen months. In the United States 
the increase in taxes and prices 
was matched everywhere except 
in the pocketbook of the white 
collar worker by an increase in 
wages. Shortages in all branches 
of engineering forced the government to subsidize engineering students and exempt them permanently from the draft and the soon-tobe-started Nowhere Journey, while 
engineers' salaries rose to match 
those of top business executives. 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY

Big news in the world of sports 
was the inclusion in the baseball 
Major Leagues of eight teams from 
the Pacific Coast, replacing the 
World Series with what was to become a mathematician's nightmare, 
the Triangle Game. 

But Christopher Temple had his 
own problems. He had his own 
life, too, which had nothing to 
do with the life of the real Christopher Temple, departed thirtyodd years later on the Nowhere 
Journey. Or rather, this was Christopher Temple, living his second 
E.C.R. . . . Temple who had lost 
once, and who, if he lost again, 
would take the dreams and hopes 
of the Western world down into 
the dust of defeat with him. But 
as the fictional (although in a certain sense, real) Christopher Temple of i960, he knew nothing of 
this. 

Th* world could go to pot. The 
world was going to pot, anyway. 
Temple shuddered as he poured a 
fourth Canadian, downing it in a 
tasteless, burning gulp. Temple 
was a thermo-nuclear engineer with 
government subsidized degrees 
from three universities including 
the fine new one at Desert Rock. 
Temple was a thermo-nuclear engineer with top-secret government 
clearance. Temple was a thermonuclear engineer with more military secrets buzzing around inside his head than in a warehouse 



of burned Pentagon files. 

Temple was also a thermo-nuclear engineer whose wife spied for 
the Russians. 

T TE'D found out quite by acci* dent, not meaning to eavesdrop at all. Returning home early 
one afternoon because the production engineer called a halt 
while further research was done 
on certain unstable isotopes, Temple was surprised to find his wife 
had a gentleman caller. He heard 
their voices clearly from where he 
stood out in the sun-parlor, and 
for a ridiculous instant he was 
torn between slinking upstairs and 
ignoring them altogether or barging into the living room like a 
high school boy flushed with jealousy. The mature thing to do. of 
course, was neither, and Temple 
was on the point of walking politely into the living room, saying 
hello and waiting for an introduction, when snatches of the conversation stopped him cold. 

"Silly Charles! Kit doesn't suspect a thing. I would know." 

"How can you be sure?" 

"Intuition." 

"On a framework of intuition 
you would place the fate of Red 
Empire?" 

"Empire, Charles?" Temple 
could picture Lucy's raised eyebrow. He listened now, hardly 
breathing. For one wild moment 



70 IMAGI 

he thought he would retreat upstairs and forget the whole thing. 
Life would be much simpler that 
way. A meaningless surrender to 
unreality, however, and it couldn't be done. 

"Yes, Empire. Oh, not the landgrabbing, slave-dominating sort 
of things the Imperialists used to 
attempt, but a more subtle and 
hence more enduring empire. Let 
the world call us Liberator, we 
shall have Empire." 

Lucy laughed, a sound which 
Temple loved. "You may keep 
your ideology, Charles. Play with 
it, bathe in it, get drunk on it or 
drown yourself in it. I want my 
money." 

"You are frank." 

Temple could picture Lucy's 
shrug. "I am a paid, professional 
spy. By now you have most of 
the information you need. I shall 
have the rest tonight." 

"I'll see you in hell first!" Temple cried in rage, stalking into the 
room and almost smiling in spite 
of the situation when he -realized 
how melodramatic -his words must 
sound. 

"Kit! Kit . . " Lucy raised 
hand to mouth, then backed away 
flinching as if she had been struck. 

"Yeah, Kit. A political cuckold, or does Charles get other services from you as well?" 

"Kit, you don't ..." 

The man named Charles mo


tioned for silence. Dapper, cleancut, good-looking except for a 
surly, pouting mouth, he was a 
head shorter than either Temple 
or Lucy. "Don't waste your words, 
Sophia. Temple overheard us." 

Sophia? thought Temple. "Sophia?" he said. 

Charles nodded coolly. "The 
real Mrs. Temple was observed, 
studied, her every habit and whim 
catalogued by experts. A plastic 
surgeon, a, psychologist, a sociologist, a linguist, a whole battery of 
experts molded Sophia here into a 
new Mrs. Temple. I must congratulate them, for you never suspected." 

"Lucy?" Temple demanded 
dully. Reason stood suspended in 
a limbo of objective acceptance 
and subjective disbelief. 

"Mrs. Temple was eliminated. 
Regrettable because we don't deal 
in senseless mayhem, but necessary." 

Temple was not aware of leaving 
limbo until he felt the bruising 
contact of his knuckles with ChSrles' jaw. The short man toppled, 
fell at his feet. "Get up!" Temple cried, then changed his mind 
and tensed himself -to leap upon 
the prone figure. 

"Hold it," Charles told him 
quietly, wiping blood from his 
lips with one hand, drawing an 
automatic from his pocket with 
the other. "You'd better freeze, 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



7i 



Temple. You die if you don't." 

>~pEMPLE froze, watched Char-*- les slither away across the 
high-piled green carpet until, safely away across the room, he came 
upright groggily. He turned to 
the dead Lucy's double. "What 
do you think, Sophia?" 

"I don't know. We could get 
out of here, probably get along 
without the final information." 

"That isn't what I mean. Naturally, we'll never receive the final 
facts. I mean, what do you think 
about Temple?" 

Sophia said she didn't know. 

"Left alone, he would go to the 
police. Kidnapped, he would be 
worse than useless. Harmful, actually, for the authorities would 
suspect something. Even worse if 
we killed him. The point is, we 
don't want the authorities to think 
Temple gave information to anybody." 

"Gave is hardly the word," said 
Sophia. "I was a good wife, but 
also a good gleaner. One hundred 
thousand dollars, Charles." 

"You bitch," Temple said. 

"Later," Charles told the woman. "The solution is this, Sophia: 
we must kill Temple, but it must 
look like suicide." 

Sophia frowned in pretty concern. "Do we have to . . . kill 
him?" 

"What's the matter, my dear? 



Have you been playing the wifely 
role too long? If Temple stands 
in the way of Red Empire, Temple must die." 

Temple edged forward. 

"Uh-uh," said Charles, "mustn't." He waved the automatic 
and Temple subsided. 

"Is that right?" Sophia demanded. "Well, you listen to me. I 
have nothing to do with your Red 
Empire. I fled the Iron Curtain, 
came here to live voluntarily — " 

"Do you really think it was on 
a voluntary basis that you went? 
We • allowed you to go, Sophia. 
We encouraged it. That way, the 
job of our technicians was all the 
simpler. Whether you like it or 
not, you have been a cog in the 
machine of Red Empire." 

"I still don't see why he has to 
die." 

"Leave thinking to those who 
can. You have a smile, a body, a 
certain way with men. I will think. 
I think that Temple should die." 

"I don't," Sophia said. 

"We're delaying needlessly. The 
man dies." And Charles raised his 
automatic, sufficiently irked to 
forget his suicide plan." 

A gap of eight or nine feet separated the two men. It might as 
well have been infinity — and it 
would be soon, for Temple. He 
saw Charles' small hand tighten 
about the automatic, saw the trigger finger grow white. The wea

pon pointed at a spot just above 
his navel and briefly he found himself wondering what it would feel 
like for a slug to rip into his stomach, burning a path back to his 
spine. He decided to make the 
gesture at least, if he could do 
no more. He would jump for Charles. 

Sophia beat him to it — and because Lucy was dead and Sophia 
looked exactly like her and Temple could not quite accept the fact, 
it seemed the most natural thing 
in the world. Cat-quick, Sophia 
leaped upon Charles' back and 
they went down together in a 
twisting, "thrashing tangle of arms 
and legs. 

Temple did not wait for an invitation. He launched himself 
down after them, and then things 
began to happen . . . fast. 

Sophia rolled clear, rose to her 
hands and knees, panting. Charles 
sat up cursing, nursing a badly 
scratched face. Temple hurtled 
at him, stretched him on his back 
again, began to pound hard fists 
into his face. 

Charles did not have the automatic. Neither did Temple. 

Something exploded against the 
back of Temple's head violently, 
throwing him off Charles and tumbling him over. Dimly he saw 
Sophia following through, the automatic in her hand, butt foremost. Temple's senses reeled. He 



tried to rise, succeeded only in a 
kind of shuddering slither before 
he subsided. He wavered between consciousness and unconsciousness, heard as in a dream 
snatches of conversation. 

"Shoot him . . . shoot him!" 

"Shut up ... I have . . . gun 
... go to hell." 

"... kill . . . only way." 

"My way is different . . . out 
of here . . . discuss later." 

"... feel ..." 

"I said . . . out of here . . . " 

The voices became a meaningless 
liquid torrent cascading into a 
black pit. 

XJOW Temple sat with a waterglass a third full of Canadian 
in his hand, every once in a while 
reaching up gingerly to explore the 
bruised swelling on his head, the 
blood-matted hair which covered 
it. To be a cuckold was one thing, 
but to be the naive, political pawn 
sort of cuckold who is not a cuckold at all, he told himself, is far 
worse. To live with his woman, 
eat the meals she cooked for him, 
talk to her, think she understood 
him, sympathize with him, to 
make love to her with passion while 
she responds with play-acting for 
a hundred thousand dollar salary 
was suddenly the most emasculating thing in the world for Temple. He had not thought to ask 
how long it had been going on. 



VOYAGE TO 

Better, perhaps, if he never knew. 
And somewhere lost in the maze 
of his thoughts was the grimmest, 
bleakest reality of them all: Lucy 
was dead. Lucy — dead. But 
where did Lucy leave off, where 
did Sophia begin? Was Lucy dead 
that night they returned more than 
a little drunk from the Chamber's 
party, that night they danced in 
the living room until dawn obscured the stars and he carried 
Lucy upstairs. Lucy or Sophia? 
And the day they motored to the 
lake, their secret lake, hardly more 
than a dammed, widened stream 
and dreamed of the .things they 
could do when the Cold War ended? Lucy — or Sophia? Had 
he ever noticed a difference in the 
way Lucy-Sophia cooked, in the 
way she spoke, the way she let 
him make love to her? He thought 
himself into a man-sized headache 
and found no answers. This way 
at least the loss of his wife was not 
as traumatic as it might have been. 
He knew not when she died or 
how and, in fact, Lucy-Sophia 
seemed so much like the real thing 
that he did not know where he 
could stop loving and start hating. 

And the girl, the Russian girl, 
had saved his life. Why? He 
couldn't answer that one either, 
unless if it were as Charles suggested: Sophia had studied Lucy 
so carefully, had learned her likes 
and dislikes, her wants and de


ETERNITY 73 

sires, had memorized and practised every quirk of her character 
to such an extent that Sophia was 
Lucy in essence. 

Which, Temple thought, would 
make it all the harder to seek out 
Sophia and kill her. 

That was the answer, the only 
answer. Temple felt a dull ache 
where his heart should have been, 
a pressure, a pounding, an unpleasant, unfamiliar lack of feeling. If 
he took his story to the F.B.I, he 
had no doubt that Charles, Sophia 
and whoever else worked this thing 
with them would be caught, but 
he, Temple, would find himself 
with a lifelong, unslakable emotional thirst. He had. to quench it 
now and then feel sorry so that 
he might heal. He had to quench 
it with Sophia's blood . . . alone. 

TTE found her a week later at 
■*• their lake. He had looked 
everywhere and had about given 
up, almost, in fact, ready to turn 
his story over to the police. But 
he had to think and their lake was 
the place for that. 

Apparently Sophia had the same 
idea. Temple parked on the highway half a mile from their lake, 
made his way slowly through the 
woods, golden dappled with sunlight. He heard the waters gushing merrily, heard the sounds of 
some small animal rushing off 
through the woods. He saw Sophia. 



74 



IMAGINATION 



She lay on their sunning rock 
in shorts and halter, completely 
relaxed, an opened magazine face 
down on the rock beside her, a 
pair of sunglasses next to it. She 
had one knee up, one leg stretched 
out, one forearm shielding her eyes 
from the sun, one arm down at 
her side. Seeing her thus, Temple 
felt the pressure of his automatic 
in its holster under his arm. He 
could draw it out, kill her before 
she was aware of his presence. 
Would that make him feel better? 
Five minutes ago, he would have 
said yes. Now he hesitated. Kill 
her, who seemed as completely 
Lucy as he was Temple? Send a 
bullet ripping through the body 
which he had known and loved, 
or the body that had seemed so 
much like it he had failed to tell 
the difference? 

Murder — Lucy? 
" "No," he said aloud. "Her name 
is Sophia." 

The girl sat up, startled. "Kit," 
she said. 

"Lucy." 

"You can't make up your mind, 
either." She smiled just like Lucy. 

Dumbly, he sat down next to 
her on the rock. Strong sunlight 
had brought a fine dew of perspiration to the bronzed skin of 
her face. She got a pack of cigarettes out from under the magazine, 
lit one, offered it to Temple, lit 
another and smoked it. "Where 



do we go from here?" she wanted 
to know. 

a j » 

"You came to kill me, didn't 
you? Is that the only way you 
can ever feel better, Kit?" 

"I—" He was going to deny 
it, then think. 

"Don't deny it. Please." She 
reached in under his jacket, withdrawing her hand with the snubnosed automatic in it. "Here," 
she said, giving it to him. 

He took the gun, hefted it, let 
it fall, clattering, on the rock. 

"Listen," she said. "I could 
have told you I was Lucy. If I 
said now that I am Lucy and if I 
kept on saying it, you'd believe 
me. You'd believe me because 
you'd want to." 

"Well," said Temple. 

"I am not Lucy. Lucy is dead. 
But . . . but I was Lucy in everything but being Lucy. I thought 
her thoughts, dreamed her dreams, 
loved her loves." 

"You killed her." 

"No. I had nothing to do with 
that. She was killed, yes. Not by 
me. Kit, if I asked you when 
Lucy stopped, and . . . when I 
began, could you tell me?" 

He had often thought about that. 
"No," he said truthfully. "You're 
as much my wife as — she was." 

SHE clutched at his hand impulsively. Then, when he 



VOYAGE Tt 

failed to respond, she withdrew her 
own hand. "Then — then I am 
Lucy. If I am Lucy in every way, 
Lucy never died." 

"You betrayed me. You stood 
by while murder was committed. 
You are guilty of espionage." 

"Lucy loved you. I am Lucy. . ." 

"... Betrayed me ... " 

"For a hundred thousand dollars. For the chance to live a normal life, for the chance to forget 
Leningrad in the wintertime, watery potato soup, rags for clothing, 
swaggering commissars, poverty, 
disease. Do you think I realized 
I could fall in love with you so 
completely? If I did, don't you 
think that would have changed 
things? I am not Sophia, Kit. I 
was, but I am not. They made 
me Lucy. Lucy can't be dead, not 
if I am she in every way." 

"What can we do?" 

"I don't know. I only want to 
be your wife ..." 

"Well, then tell me," he said 
bitterly. "Shall I go back to the 
plant and continue working, knowing all the time that our most 
closely guarded secret is in Russian hands and that my wife is 
responsible?" He laughed. "Shall 
I do that?" 

"Your secrets never went anywhere." 

"Shall I . . . what?" 

"Your secrets never went anywhere. Charles is dead. I have de


ETERNITY 75 

stroyed all that we took. I am not 
Russian any longer. American. 
They made me American. They 
made me Lucy. I want to go right 
on being Lucy, your wife." 

Temple said nothing for a long 
time. He realized now he could 
not kill her. But everything else 
she suggested . . . "Tell me," he 
said. "Tell me, how long have you 
been Lucy? You've got to tell me 
that." 

"How long have we been married?" 

"You know how long. Three 
years." 

Sophia crushed her cigarette out 
on the rock, wiped perspiration 
(tears?) from her cheek with the 
back of her hand. "You have never known anyone but me in your 
marriage bed, Kit." 

"You — you're lying." 

"No. They did what they did 
on the eve of your marriage. I 
have been your wife for as long 
as you have had one." 

Temple's head whirled. It had 
been a quick courtship. He had 
known Lucy only two weeks in 
those hectic post-graduate days of 
1957. But for fourteen brief days, 
it was Sophia he had known all 
along. 

"Sophia, I—" 

"There is no Sophia, not any 
more." 

He had hardly known Lucy, the 
real Lucy. This girl here was his 



7 6 



IMAGINATION 



wife, always had been. Had the 
first fourteen days with Lucy been 
anything but a dream? He was 
sorry Lucy had died — but the Lucy 
he had thought dead was Sophia, 
very much alive. 

He took her in his arms, almost 
crushing her. He held her that 
way, kissed her savagely, letting 
passion of a different sort take 
the place of murder. 

This is my woman, he thought, 
and awoke on his white pallet in 
Nowhere. 

CCT AM awake," said Temple. 

A -"We see that. You shouldn't be." 
"No?" 

"No. There is one more dream." 

Temple dozed restfully but was 
soon aware of a commotion. 
Strangely, he did not care. He was 
too tired to open his eyes, anyway. Let whatever was going to 
happen, happen. He wanted his 
sleep. 

But the voice persisted. 

"This is highly irregular. You 
came in here once and — " 

"I did you a favor, didn't I?" 
(That voice is familiar, Temple 
thought.) 

"Well, yes. But what now?" 

"Temple's record is now one and 
one. In the second sequence he 
was the victor. The Soviet entry 
had to extract certain information 
from him and turn it over to her 



people. She extracted the information well enough but somehow 
Temple made her change her mind. 
The information never went anyplace. How Temple managed to play 
oounterspy I don't know, but he 
played it and won." 

"That's fine. But what do you 
want?" 

"The final E.C.R. is critical." 
(The voice was Arkalion's!) "How 
critical, I can't tell you. Sufficient 
though, if you know that you lose 
no matter how Temple fares. If the 
Russian woman defeats Temple, 
you lose." 

"Naturally." 

"Let me finish. If Temple defeats the Russian woman, you also 
Jose. Either way, Earth is the 
loser. I haven't time to explain 
what you wouldn't understand 
anyway. Will you cooperate?" 

"Umm-mm. You did save Temple's life. Umm-mm, yes. All 
right." 

"The third dream sequence is the 
wrong dream, the wrong contest 
with the wrong antagonist at the 
wrong time, when a far more important contest is brewing . . . 
with the fate of Earth as a reward 
for the victor." 

"What do you propose?" 

"I will arrange Temple's final 
dream. But if he disappears from 
this room, don't be alarmed. It's 
a dream of a different sort. Temple won't know it until the dream 



VOYAGE TO 

progresses, you won't know it until everything is concluded, but 
Temple will fight for a slave or a 
free Earth." 

"Can't you tell us more?" 

"There is no time, except to say 
that along with the rest of the Galaxy, you've been duped. The Nowhere Journey is a grim, tragic 
farce. 

"Awaken, Kit!" 

Temple awoke into what he 
thought was the third and final 
dream. Strange, because this time 
he knew where he was and why, 
knew also that he was dreaming, 
even remembered vividly the other 
two dreams. 

UOTEALTH," said Arkalion, 
^ and led Temple through long, 
white-walled corridors. They finally came to a partially open door 
and paused there. Peering within, Temple saw a room much like 
the one he had left, with two 
white-gowned figures standing 
anxiously over a table. And prone 
on the table was Sophia, whom 
Temple had loved short moments 
before, in his second dream. Moments? Years. (Never, except in 
a dream.) 

"She's lovely," Arkalion whispered. 

"I know." Like himself, Sophia 
was garbed in a loose jumper and 
slacks. 

"Stealth," said Arkalion again. 



ETERNITY 77 

"Haste." Arkalion disappeared. 

"Well," Temple told himself. 
"What now? At least in the other 
dreams I was thrust so completely 
into things, I knew what to do." 
He rubbed his jaw grimly. "Not 
that it did much good the first 
time." 

Temple poked the partially-ajar 
door with his foot, pushing it open. 
The two white-smocked figures had 
their backs to him, leaned intently over the table and Sophia. Without knowing what motivated him, 
Temple leaped into the room, 
grasped the nearer figure's arm, 
whirled him around. Startled confusion began to alter the man's 
coarse features, but his face went 
slack when Temple's fist struck 
his jaw with terrible strength. The 
man collapsed. 

The second man turned, mouthing a stream of what must have 
been Russian invective. He parried Temple's quick -blow with his 
left hand, crossing his own right 
fist to Temple's face and almost 
ending the fight as quickly as it 
had started. Temple went down in a 
heap and was vaguely aware of the 
Russian's booted foot hovering 
over his face. He reached out, 
grabbed the boot with both hands, 
twisted. The man screamed and 
fell and then they were rolling 
over and over, striking each other 
with fists, knees, elbows, gouging, 
butting, cursing. Temple found 



78 



IMAGINATION 



the Russian's throat, closed his 
hands around it, applied pressure. 
Fists pounded his face, nails raked 
him, but slowly he succeeded in 
throttling the Russian. When Temple got to his feet, trembling, the 
Russian stared blankly at the ceiling. He would go on staring that 
way until someone shut his eyes. 

Not questioning the incomprehensible, Temple knew he had 
done what he must. Hardly seeking for the motive he could 
not find he lifted the unconscious 
Sophia off the table, slung her long 
form across his shoulder, plodded 
with her from the room. Arkalion 
had said haste. He would hurry. 

He next was aware of a spaceship. Remembering no time lag, 
he simply stood in the ship with 
Arkalion. And Sophia. 

TTE knew it was a spaceship because he had been in one before and although the sensation of 
weightlessness was not present, 
they were in deep space. "Stars you 
never see through an obscuring atmosphere hung suspended in the 
viewports. Cold-bright, not flickering against the plush blackness 
of deep space, phalanxes and legions of stars without numbers, in 
such wild profusion that space actually seemed three dimensional. 

"This -is a different sort of 
dream," said Sophia in English. 
"I remember. I remember every


thing. Kit—" 

"Hello." He felt strangely 
shy, became mildly angry when 
Arkalion hardly tried to suppress 
a slight snicker. "Well, that second dream wasn't our idea," Temple protested. "Once there, we 
tic ted cind 

"And".'. . " said Sophia. 

"And nothing," Arkalion told 
them. "You haven't time. This is 
a spaceship, not like the slow, 
Mumbling craft your people use' 
to reach Mars or Jupiter." 

"Our people?" Temple demanded. "Not yours?" 

"Will you let me finish? Light 
is a laggard crawler by comparison 
with the drive propelling this ship. 
Temple, Sophia, we are leaving 
your Galaxy altogether." 

"Is that a fact?" said Sophia, 
her Jupiter-found knowledge telling her they were traveling an unthinkable distance. "For some 
final contest between us, no doubt, 
to decide whether the U.S.S.R. or 
the U. S. represents Earth? Kit, 
I 1-love you, hut ..." 

"But Russia is more important, 
huh?" 

"No. I didn't say that. All my 
training has been along those lines, 
though, and even if I'm aware it 
is indoctrination, the fact still 
remains. If your country is truly 
better, but if I have seen your 
country only through the eyes of 
Pravda, how can I ... I don't 



VOYAGE TO 

know, Kit. Let me think." 

"You needn't," said Arkalion, 
smiling. "If the two of you would 
let me get on with it you'd see 
this particular train of thought is 
meaningless, quite meaningless." 
Arkalion cleared his throat. 

"Strange, but I have much the 
same problem as Sophia has. My 
indoctrination was far more subtle 
though. Far more convincing, 
based upon eons of propaganda 
methods. Temple, Sophia, those 
who initiated the Nowhere Journey 
for hundreds of worlds of your 
galaxy did so with a purpose." 

"I know. To decide Who gets 
their vast knowledge." 

"Wrong. To find suitable hosts 
in a one-way relationship which is 
hardly symbiosis, really out and 
but parasitism." 

"What?" 

And Sophia: "What -are you 
talking about?" 

"The sick, decadent, tired old 
creatures you consider your superiors. Parasites.' They need hosts 
in order to survive. Their old 
hosts have been milked dry, have 
become too highly specialized, are 
now incapable physically or emotionally of meeting a wide variety 
of environmental challenges. The 
Nowhere Journey is to find a suitable new host. They have found 
one. You of Earth." 

"I don't understand," Temple 
said, remembering the glowing ac


ETERNITY 79 

counts of the 'superboys' he had 
been given by his brother Jason. 
"I just don't get it. How can we 
be duped like that? Wouldn't 
someone have figured it out? And 
if they have all the power everyone says, there isn't much we can 
do about it, anyway." 

Arkalion scowled darkly. "Then 
write Earth's obituary. You'll 
need one." 

"Go ahead," Sophia told Arkalion. "There's more you want to 
say." 

"All right. Temple's thought is 
correct. They have tremendous 
power. That is why you could 
be duped so readily. But their 
power is not concentrated here. 
These much-faster-than-light ships 
are an extreme rarity, for the power-drive no longer exists. Five 
ships in all, I believe. Hardly 
enough to invade a planet, even 
for them. It takes them thousands 
of years to get here otherwise. 
Thousands. Just as it took me, 
when I came to Mars and Earth 
in the first place." 

"What?" cried Temple. "You 

"I am one of them. Correct. I 
suppose you would call me a subversive, but I have made up my 
mind. "Parasitism is unsatisfactory, when the Maker got us started on symbiosis. Somewhere along 
the line, evolution took a wrong 
turn. We are—monsters." 



IMAGINATION 



"What do you look like?" Sophia demanded while Temple 
stood there shaking his head and 
muttering to himself. 

4C"\^ 0U couldn't see me, I am 
* afraid. I was the representative here to see how things were 
going, and when my people found 
you of the Earth divided yourselves into two camps they realized they had been considering 
your abilities in halves. Put together, you are probably the top 
culture of your galaxy." 

"So, we win," said Temple. 

"Right and wrong. You lose. 
Earthmen will become hosts. Know 
what a back-seat driver is, Temple? You would be a back seat 
driver in your own body. Thinking, feeling, wanting to make decisions, but unable to. Eating 
when the parasite wants to, sleeping at his command, fighting, loving, living as he wills it. And 
perishing when he wants a new 
garment. Oh, they offer something in return. Their culture, 
their way of life, their scientific, 
economic, social system. It's good, 
too. But not worth it. Did you 
know that their economic struggle 
between democratic capitalism and 
totalitarian communism ended almost half a million years ago? 
What they have now is a system 
you couldn't even understand." 

"Well," Temple mused, "even if 



everything you said were true — " 
"Don't tell me you don't believe 

me?" 

"If it were true and we wanted 
to do something about it, what 
could we do?" 

"Now, nothing. Nothing but 
delay things by striking swiftly 
and letting fifty centuries of time 
perform your rearguard action. 
Destroy the one means your enemy has of reaching Earth within 
foreseeable time and you have destroyed his power to invade for a 
hundred centuries. He can still 
reach Earth, but the same way you 
journeyed to Nowhere. Ten thousand years of space travel in suspended animation. You saw me 
that way once, Temple, and wondered. You thought I was dead, 
but that is another story. 

"Anyway, let my people invade 
your planet, ten thousand years 
hence. If Earth takes the right 
direction, if democracy and free 
thought and individual enterprise 
win over totalitarian standardization as I think they will, your people will be more than a match for 
the decadent parasites who may or 
may not have sufficient initiative 
to cross space the slow way and 
attempt invasion in ten thousand 



"Ten thousand?" said Temple. 

"Five from Earth to Nowhere. 
The distance to my home is far 
greater, but the rate of travel can 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



81 



be increased. Ten thousand years." 

"Tell me," Temple demanded 
abruptly, "is this a dream?" 

Arkalion smiled. "Yes and no. 
It is not a dream like the . others 
because I assure you your bodies 
are not now resting on a pair of 
identical white tables. Still in the 
other dreams physical things could 
happen to you, while now you'll 
find you can do things as in a 
dream. For example, neither one 
of you knows the intricacies of a 
spaceship, yet if you are to save 
your planet, you must know the 
operation of the most intricate of 
all space ships, a giant space station." 

"Then we're not dreaming?" 
asked Temple. 

"I never said that. Consider this 
sequence of events about half way 
between the dream stage you have 
already seen and reality itself. Remember this: you'll have to work 
together; you'll have to function 
like machines. You will be handling totally alien equipment with 
only the sort of knowledge which 
can be played into your brains to 
guide you." 

Sophia sighed. "Being an American, Kit is too much of an individual to help in such a situation." 

Temple snorted. "Being a cog 
in a simple, state-wide machine is 
one thing — orienting yourself in a 
totally new situation is another." 

"Yes, well—" 



"See?" Arkalion cautioned. 
"See? Already you are arguing, 
but you must work together completely, with not the slightest 
conflict between you. As it is, you 
hardly have a chance." 

"What about you?" said Sophia 
practically. "Can't you help?" 

ARKALION shook his head. 
"No. While I'd like to see 
you come out of this thing on top, 
I would not like to sacrifice my 
life for it— which is exactly what 
I'd do if I remained with you and 
you lost. 

"So, let's get down to detail. 
Imagine space being folded, imagine your time sense slowing, imagine a new dimension which negates the need for extensive linear 
travel, imagine anything you want 
— but we are in the process of 
moving nine hundred thousand 
light years through deep space. 
There is a great galaxy at that distance, almost a twin of your Milky 
Way: you call it the Andromeda 
Nebula. Closer to your own system are the two Magellanic Clouds, 
so called, something else which 
you table NGC 6822, and finally 
the Triangulum Galaxy. All have 
billions of stars, but none of the 
stars have life. To find life outside your galaxy you must seek it 
across almost a million light years. 
My people live in Andromeda. 
"Guarding the flank of their 



IMAGINATION 



galaxy and speeding through inter-galactic space at many light 
years per minute is what you might 
call a space station — but on a scale 
you've never dreamed of. Five of 
your miles in diameter, it is a 
fortress of terrible strength, a 
storehouse of half a million years 
of weapon development. It has 
been arranged that the one man 
running this station — " 

"Just one?" Temple asked. 

"Yes. You will see why when 
you get there. It has been arranged that he will leave, ostensibly on a scouting expedition. You 
see, I am not alone in this venture. 
At any rate, he will report that the 
space station has been taken — as, 
indeed, it will be, by the two of 
you. The only ships capable of 
overtaking your station in its 
flight will be the only ships capable of reaching your galaxy before 
cultural development gives you a 
chance to survive. They will attack you. You will destroy them 
— or be destroyed yourselves. Any 
questions?" 

The whole thing sounded fantastic to Temple. Could the fate 
of all Earth rest on their shoulders in a totally alien environment? 
Could they be expected to win? 
Temple had no reason to doubt 
the former, as wild as it sounded. 
As for the latter, all he could do 
was hope. "Tell me," he said, "how 
will we learn the use of all the 



weapons you claim are at our disposal?" 

"Can you answer that for him, 
Sophia?" Arkalion wanted to 
know. 

"Umm, I think so. The same 
way I had all sorts of culture 
crammed into me on Jupiter." 

"Precisely. Only take it from 
me our refinement is far better, 
and the amount you have to learn 
actually is less." 

"What I'd like to know—" Sophia began. 

"Forget it. I want some sleep 
and you'll learn everything that's 
necessary at the space station." 

And after that, ply Arkalion as 
they would with questions, he 
slumped down in his chair and 
rested. Temple could suddenly 
understand and appreciate. He felt 
like curling up into a tight little 
ball himself and sleeping until everything was over, one way or the 
other. 

CHAPTER X 

UTT'S all so big! So incredible! 

*■ We'll never understand it! 

Never ..." 

"Relax, Sophia. Arkalion said 
)> 

"I know what Arkalion said, but 
we haven't learned anything yet." 

Hours before, Arkalion had 
landed them on the space station, 
a gleaming, five-mile in diameter 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



§3 



globe, and had quickly departed. 
Soon after that they had found 
themselves in a veritable labyrinth 
of tunnels, passageways, vaults. 
Occasionally they passed a great 
glowing screen, * and always the 
view of space was the same. Like 
a magnificent, elongated shield, 
sparkling with a million million 
points of light, pale gold, burnished copper, blue of glacial ice and 
silver white, the Andromeda Galaxy spanned space from upper 
right to lower left. Off at. the 
lower right hand corner they could 
see their space station; apparently 
the viewer itself stood far removed 
in space, projecting its images here 
at the globe. 

Awed the first time they had 
seen one of the screens, Temple 
said, "All the poets who ever wrote 
a line would have given half their 
lives to see this as we see it now." 

"And all the writers, musicians, 
artists ..." 

"Anyone, who ever thought creatively, Sophia. How can you say 
it's breathtaking or anything like 
that when words weren't ever spoken which can ..." 

"Let's not go poetic just yet," 
Sophia admonished him with a 
smile. "We'd better get squared 
away here, as the expression goes, 
before it's too late." 

"Yes . . . Hello, what's this?" 
A door irised open for them in a 
solid wall of metal. Irised was the 



only word Temple could think of, 
for a tiny round hole appeared in 
the wall spreading evenly in all directions with a slow, uniform, almost liquid motion. When it was 
large enough to walk through, they 
entered a completely bare room 
and Temple whirled in time to see 
the entrance irising shut. 

"Something smells," said Sophia, sniffing at the air. 

Sweet and cloying, the odor 
grew stronger. Temple may have 
heard a faint hissing sound. "I'm 
getting sleepy," he said. 

Nodding, Sophia ran, banged on 
the wall where the door had opened 
so suddenly, then closed. No response. "Is it a trap?" 

"By whom? For what?" Temple found it difficult to keep his 
eyes from closing. "Fight it if 
you want, Sophia. I'm going to 
sleep." And he squatted in the 
center of the floor, staring vacantly at the bare wall. 

Just as Temple' was drifting off 
into a dream about complex machinery he did not yet understand 
but realized he soon would, Sophia 
joined him the hard way, collapsing alongside of him, unconscious 
and sprawling gracelessly on the 
floor. 

Temple slept. 

tcOLEEPY-HEAD, get up." 

Sophia stirred as he spoke 
and shook her. She yawned,

IMAGINATION 



stretched, smiled up at him lazily. 
"How do you feel now?" 
"Hungry, Kit." 

"That's a point. It's all right 
now, though. I know exactly 
where the food concentrates are 
kept. Three levels below us, second segment of the wall. You can 
make those queer doors iris by 
pressing the wall twice, with about 
a one second interval." 

They found the food compartment, discovered row ' on row of 
cans, boxes, jars. Temple opened 
one of the cans, gazed in disappointment on a sorry looking thing 
the size of his thumb. Brown, 
shriveled, dry and almost flaky, 
it might have been a bird. 

Sophia turned up her nose. "If 
that's the best this place has to 
offer, I'm not so hungry anymore." 

Suddenly, she gaped. So did 
Temple. A savory odor attracted 
their attention, steam rising from 
the small can added to their interest. Amazing things happened to 
the withered scrap of food on 
exposure to the air. Temple barely had time to extract it from the 
can, burning his fingers in the 
process, when it became twice the 
can's size. It grew and by the time 
it finished, it was as savory looking a five pound fowl as Temple 
had ever seen. Roasted, steaming 
hot, ready to eat. 

They tore into it with savage 
gusto. 



"Stephanie should see me now," 
Temple found himself saying and 
regretted it. 

"Stephanie? Who's that?" 

"A girl." 

"Your girl?" 

"What's the difference? She's 
a million light years and fifty centuries away." 

"Answer me." 

"Yes," said Temple, wishing he 
could change the subject. "My 
girl," He hadn't thought of Stephanie in a long time, perhaps because it was meaningless to think 
of someone dead fifty centuries. 
Now that the thoughts had been 
stirred within him, though, he 
found them poignantly pleasant. 

"Your girl . . . and you would 
marry her if you could?" 

He had grown attached to Sophia, not in reality, but in the 
second of their dream worlds. He 
wished the memory of the dream 
had not lingered for it disturbed 
him. In it he had loved Sophia 
as much as he now loved Stephanie although the one was obtainable and the other was a five. thousand year pinch of dust. And 
how much of the dream lingered 
with him, in his head and his 
heart? 

"Let's forget about it," Temple suggested. 

"No. If she were here today 
and if everything were normal, 
would you. marry her?" 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



85 



"Why talk about what can't 
be?" 

"I want to know, that's why." 

"All right. Yes, I would. I 
would marry Stephanie." 

"Oh," said Sophia. "Then what 
happened in the dream meant 
. . . nothing." 

"We were two different people," 
Temple said coolly, then wished he 
hadn't for it was only half-true. 
He remembered everything aibout 
the dream-which-was-more-than-adream vividly. He had been far 
more intimate with Sophia, and 
over a longer period of time, than 
he had ever been with Stephanie. 
And even if Stephanie appeared 
impossibly on the spot and he spent 
the rest of his life as her husband, 
still he would never forget his 
dream-life with Sophia. In time 
he could let himself tell her that. 
But not now; now the best thing 
he could do would be to change 
the subject. 

"I see," Sophia answered him 
coldly. 

"No, you don't. Maybe some 
day you will." 

"There's nothing but what you 
told me. I see." 

"No . . . forget it," he told her 
wearily. 

"Of course. It was only a dream 
anyway. The dream before that 
I almost killed you out of hatred 
anyway. Love and hate, I guess 
they neutralize. We're just a 



couple of people who have to do 
a job together, that's all." 

"For gosh sakes, Sophia! That 
isn't true. I loved Stephanie. I 
still would, were Stephanie alive. 
But she's — she's about as accessible as the Queen of Sheba." 

"So? There's an American expression—you're carrying a torch." 

Probably, Temple realized, it 
was true. But what did all of that 
have to do with Sophia? If he 
and Sophia ... if they . . . would 
it be fair to Sophia? It would be 
exactly as if a widower remarried, 
with the memory of his first wife 
set aside in his heart . . .' no, different, for he had never wed Stephanie, and always kuhim would 
be the desire for what had 
never been. 

"Let's talk about it some other 
time," Temple almost pleaded, 
wanting the respite for himself as 
much as for Sophia. 

"No. We don't have to talk 
about it ever. I won't be second 
best, Kit. Let's forget all about 
it and do our job. I — I'm sorry I 
brought the whole thing up." 

Temple felt like an unspeakable 
heel. And, anyway, the whole 
thing wasn't resolved in his mind. 
But they couldn't just let it go at 
that, not in case something happened when the ships came and 
one or both of them perished. Awkwardly, for now he felt self-conscious about everything, he got 



86 



IMAGINATION 



his arms about Sophia, drew her 
to him, placed his lips to hers. 

That was as far as he got. She 
wrenched free, shoved clear of 
him. "If you try that again, you 
will have another dislocated jaw." 

Temple shrugged wearily. If 
anything were to be resolved between them, it would be later. 

When the ships came moments 
afterwards — seven, not the five Arkalion predicted — they were com■ pletely unprepared. 

'T'EMPLE spotted them first on 
one of the viewing, screens, 
half way between the receiver and 
the space station itself, silhouetted 
against th# elongated shield of Andromeda. They soared out of the 
picture, appeared again minutes 
later, zooming in from the other 
direction in two flights of four 
ships and three. 

"Come on!" Sophia cried over 
her shoulder, irising the door and 
plunging from the room. Temple 
followed at her heels but her Jupiter trained muscles pushed her 
lithe legs in long, powerful strides 
and soon she outdistanced him. 
By the time he reached the armaments vault, breathless, she was 
seated at the single gun-emplacement, her fingers on the controls. 

"Watch the viewing screen and 
tell me how we're doing," Sophia 
told him, not taking her eyes from 
the dials and levers. 



Temple watched, fascinated, 
saw a thin pencil of radiant energy 
leap out into space, missing one 
of the ships by what looked like 
a scant few miles. He called the 
corrective azimuth to her, hardly 
surprised by the way his mind had 
absorbed and now could use its 
new-found knowledge. 

Temple understood and yet did 
not understand. For example, he 
knew the station had but one gun 
and Sophia sat at it now, yet in 
certain ways it didn't make sense. 
Could it cover all sectors of, space? 
His mind supplied the answer although he had not been aware of 
the knowledge an instant- before: 
yes. The space station did not 
merely rotate. Its surface was a 
spherical projection of a moving 
Moebius strip and although he 
tried to envision the concept, he 
failed. The weapon could be fired 
at any given point in space at 
twenty second intervals, covering 
every other conceivable point in 
the ensuing time. 

Sophia was firing again and 
Temple watched the thin beam 
leap across space. "Hit!" he roared. "Hit!" 

Something flashed at the front 
end of the lead ship. The light 
blinded him, but when he could 
see again only six ships remained 
in space—casting perfect shadows 
on the Andromeda Galaxy! The 
source of light, Temple realized 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



87 



triumphantly, was out of range, 
but he could picture it — a glowing derelict of a ship, spewing 
heat, light and radioactivity into 
the void. 

"One down," Sophia called. 
"Six to go. I like your American 

expressions. Like sitting ducks 
» 

She did not finish. Abruptly, 
light flared all around them. Something shrieked in Temple's ears. 
The vault shuddered, shook. Girders clattered to the floor, stove it 
in, revealing black rock. Sophia 
was thrown back from the single 
gun, crashing against the wall, 
flipping in air and landing on her 
stomach. 

Temple ran to her, turned her 
over. Blood smeared her face, 
trickled from her lips. Although 
she did not move, she wasn't dead. 
Temple half dragged, half carried 
her from the vault into an adjoining room. He stretched her out 
comfortably as he could on the 
floor, ran 'back into the vault. 

Molten metal had collected in 
one corner of the room, crept sluggishly toward him across the floor, 
heating it white-hot. He skirted 
it, climbed over a twisted girder, 
pushed his way past other debris, 
found himself at the gun emplacement. 

"How dumb can I get?" Temple said aloud. "Sophia ran to 
•the gun, must have assumed I set 



up the shields." Again, it was an 
item of information stored in his 
mind by the wisdom of the space 
station. Protective shields made 
it impossible for anything but a direct hit on the emplacement to do 
them any harm, only Temple had 
never set the shields in place. He 
did so now, merely by tripping a 
series of levers, but glancing at a 
dial to his left he realized with 
alarm that the damage possibly 
had already been done. The needle, 
which measured lethal radiation, 
hovered half way between negative and the critical area marked in 
red and, even as Temple watched 
it, crept closer to the red. 

TTOW much time did he have? 

*■ Temple could not be sure, 
bent grimly over the weapon. It 
was completely unfamiliar to his 
mind, completely unfamiliar to his 
fingers. He toyed with it, released a blast of radiant energy, whirled to face the viewing screen. The 
beam streaked out into the void, 
clearly hundreds of miles from its 
objective. 

Cursing, Temple tried again, 
scoring a near miss. The ships 
were trading a steady stream of 
fire with him now, but with the 
shielding up it was harmless, 
striking and then bouncing back 
into space. Temple scored his first 
hit five minutes after sitting down 
at the gun, whooped triumphantly 



88 



IMAGINATION 



and fired again. Five ships left. 

But the dial indicated an increase in radioactivity as newly 
created neutrons spread their poison like a cancer. Behind Temple, the vault was a shambles. The 
pool of molten metal had increased 
in size, almost cutting off any possibility of escape. He could jump 
it now, Temple realized, but it 
might grow larger. Consolidating 
its gains now, it had sheared a pit 
in the floor, had commenced vaporizing the rock below it, hissing and 
lapping with white-hot insistence. 

Something boomed, grated, 
boomed again and Temple watched another girder bounce off the 
floor, dip one end into the molten 
pool and clatter out a stub. Apparently the damage was extensive; a 
structural weakness threatened to 
make the entire ceiling go. 

Temple fired again, got another 
ship. He could almost feel death 
breathing on his shoulder, in no 
great hurry but sure of its prize. 
He fired the weapon. 

Tf one ship remained when they 
could no longer use the gun, they 
would have failed. One ship might 
make the difference for Earth. 
One . . . 

Three left. Two. 

They raked the space station 
with blast after blast — futilely. 
They spun and twisted and streaked by, offering poor targets. Temple waited his chance . . . and 



glanced at the dial which measured 
radioactivity. He yelped, stood up. 
The needle had encroached upon 
the red area. Death to remain where 
he was more than a moment or 
two. Not quick death, but rather 
slow and lingering. He could do 
what he had to, then perish hours 
later. His life— for Earth? If 
Arkalion had known all the answers, and if he could get both 
ships and if there weren't another 
alternative for the aliens, the 
parasites . . . Temple stabbed out 
with his pencil heam, caught the 
sixth ship, then saw the needle dip 
completely into the red. He got 
up trembling, stepped hack, . half 
tripped on the stump of a girder as 
his eyes strayed in fascination to 
the viewing screen. The seventh 
ship was out of range, hovering 
off in the void somewhere, awaiting its chance. If Temple left the 
gun the ship would come in close 
enough to hit the emplacement 
despite its protective shielding. 
Well, it was suicide to remain 
there — especially when the ship 
wasn't even in view. 

Temple leaped over the molten 
pool and left the vault. 




E found Sophia stirring, sitting up. 



"What hit me?" she said, and 
laughed. "Something seems to 
have gone wrong, Kit . . . what 
. . . ?" 



VOYAGE TO ETERNITY 



89 



"It's all right now," be told 

her, lying. 

"You look pale." 

"You got one. I got five. One 
ship to go." 

"What are you waiting for?" 
And Sophia sprang to her feet, 
heading for the vault. 

"Hold it!" Temple snapped. 
"Don't go in there." 

"Why not. I'll get the last ship 
and—" 

"Don't go in there!" Temple 
tugged at her arm, pulled her 
away from the vault and its 
broken door which would not iris 
closed any more. 

"What's the matter, Kit?" 
"I — I want to finish the last one 
myself, that's all." 

Sophia got herself loose, reached the circular doorway, peered 
inside. "Like Dante's ^Inferno," 
she said. "You told me nothing 
was the matter. Well, we can get 
through to the emplacement, Kit." 

"No." And again he stopped 
her. At least he had lived in freedom all his life and although he 
was still young and did not want 
to die, Sophia had never known 
freedom until now and it wouldn't be right df she perished without savoring its fruits. He had a 
love, dust fifty centuries, he had 
his past and his memories. Sophia 
had only the future. Clearly, if 
someone had to yield life, Temple would do it. 



"It's worse than it looks," he 
told her quietly, drawing her back 
from the door again. He explained what had happened, told her 
the radioactivity had not quite 
reached critical point— which was 
a lie. "So," he concluded, "we're 
waiting time. If I. rush in there, 
fire, and rush right out everything 
will be fine." 

"Then let me. I'm quicker than 
you." 

"No. I — I'm more familiar with 
the gun." Dying would not be 
too bad, if he went with reasonable certainty he had saved the 
Earth. No man ever died so importantly, Temple thought briefly, 
then felt cold fear when he realized it would be dying just the 
same. He fought it down, said: 
"I'll be right back." 

Sophia looked at him, smiling 
vaguely. "Then you insist on doing it?" 

When he nodded she told him, 
"Then, — kiss me. Kiss me now, 
Kit — in case something .. . . " 

Fiercely, he swept her to him, 
bruising her lips with his. "Sophia, 
Sophia ..." 

At last, she drew back. "Kit," 
she said, smiling demurely. She 
took his right hand in her left, 
held it, squeezed it. Her own right 
hand she suddenly brought up 
from her waist, fist clenched, driving it against his jaw. 

Temple fell, half stunned by 



90 



IMAGINATION 



the blow, at her feet. For the 
space of a single heartbeat he 
watched her move slowly toward 
the round doorway, then he had 
clambered to his feet, running after 
her. He got his arms on her 
shoulders, yanked at her. 

When she turned he saw she was 
crying. "I— I'm sorry, Kit. You 
couldn't fool me about . . . Stephanie. You can't fool me about this." 
She had more leverage this time. 
She stepped back, bringing her 
small, hard fist up from her knees. 
It struck Temple squarely at the 
point of the jaw, with the strength 
of Jovian-trained muscle behind it. 
Temple's feet left the floor and 
he landed with a thud on his back. 
His last thought of Sophia — or of 
anything, for a while — made him 
smile faintly as he lost consciousness. For a kiss she had promised 
him another dislocated jaw, and 
she had kept her promise . . . 
* * * 

Later, how much later he did 
not know, something soft cushioned his head. He opened his eyes, 
stared through swirling, spinning 
murk. He focussed, saw Arkalion. 
No — two Arkalions standing off 
at a distance, watching him. He 
squirmed, knew his head was 
cushioned in a woman's lap. He 
sighed, tried to sit up and failed. 
Soft hands caressed his forehead, 
his cheeks. A face swam into vision, but mistily. "Sophia," he 



murmured. His vision cleared. 
It was Stephanie. 

CCTT'S over," said Arkalion. 

"We're on our way back to 
Earth, Kit." 

"But the ships—" 
- "All destroyed. If my people 
want to come here in ten thousand 
years, let them try. I have a 
hunch you of Earth will be ready 
for them." 

"It took us five thousand to 
reach Nowhere," Temple mused. 
"It will take us five thousand to 
return. We'll come barely in time 
to warn Earth—" 

"Wrong," said Arkalion. "I still 
have my ship. We're in it now, 
so you'll reach Earth with almost 
fifty centuries to spare. Why don't 
you forget about it, though? If 
human progress for the next five 
thousand years matches what has 
been happening for the last five, 
the parasites won't stand a 
chance." 

"Earth — five thousand years in 
the future," Stephanie said dreamily. "I wonder what it will be 
like . . . Don't be so startled, Kit. 
I was a pilot study on the Nowhere Journey. If I made it successfully, other women would have 
been sent. But now there won't 
be any need." 

'T wouldn't be too sure of that," 
said the real Alaric Arkalion III. 
"I suspect a lot of people are go


VOYAGE TO 

ing to feel just like me. Why not 
go out and colonize space. We can 
do it. Wonderful to have a frontier again . . . Why, a dozen billionaires will appear for every 
one like my father. Good for the 
economy." 

"So, if we don't like Earth," 
said Stephanie, "we can always 
go out." 

"I have a strong suspicion you 
will like it," said Arkalion's double. 

Alaric III grinned. "What about 
you, bud? I don't want a twin 
brother hanging around all the 
time." 

Arkalion grinned back at him. 
"What do you want me to do, 
young man? I've forsaken my 
people. This is now my body. 
Tell you what, I promise to be 
always on a different continent. 
Earth isn't so small that I'll get 
in your hair." 

Temple sat up, felt the bandages 
on his jaw. He smiled at Stephanie, told her he loved her and 
meant it. It was exactly as if she 
had returned from the grave and 
in his first exultation he hadn't 
even thought of Sophia, who had 
perished all alone in the depths of 
space that a world might live . . . 

He turned to Arkalion. "Sophia?" 

"We found her dead, Kit. But 
smiling, as if everything was worth 
it." 



ETERNITY 91 

"It should have been me." 

"Whoever Sophia was," said 
Stephanie, "she must have been a 
wonderful woman, because when 
you got up, when you came to, her 
name was ..." 

"Forget it," said Temple. "Sophia and I have a very strange relationship and ..." 

"All right, you said forget it. 
Forget it." Stephanie smiled down 
at him. "I love you so much 
there isn't .even room for jealousy 
. . . Ummm ... Kit ... " 

"Break up that clinch," ordered 
Arkalion. "We're making one 
more stop at Nowhere to pick up 
anyone who wants to return to 
Earth. Some of 'em probably 
won't but those who do are welcome ..." 

"Jason will stay," Temple predicted. "He'll be a leader out 
among the stars." 

"Then he'll have to climb over 
my back," Alaric III predicted 
happily, his eyes on the viewport 
hungrily. 

Temple's jaw throbbed. He was 
tired and sleepy. But satisfied. 
Sophia had died and for that he 
was sad, but there would always 
be a place deep in his heart for 
the memory of her: delicious, 
somehow exotic, not a love the way 
Stephanie was, not as tender, not 
as sure . . . but a feeling for Sophia that was completely unique. 
And whenever the strangeness of 



9 2 

the far-future Earth frightened 
Temple, whenever he felt a situation might get the better of him, 
whenever doubt clouded judgment, 
he would remember the tall lithe girl 
who had walked to her death that 
a world might have the freedom 
she barelv had tasted. And to


IMAGINATION 



gether with Stephanie he would be 
able to do anything. 

Unless, he thought dreamily as 
he drifted off to sleep, his head 
pillowed again on Stephanie's lap, 
he'd wind up with a bum jaw the 
rest of his life.

up and go. Korea, Europe, North 
Africa, Iceland, some un-named 
speck in the Aleutian chain. 

I got to thinking: it could be 
worse. What happens if you take 
this one step further in some future army — there's a draft, all 
right, and they send you places, 
but you don't know where. No one 
does. They send you and you're 
supposed to come back, but in 
twenty years no one ever has. 
You're scared, confused, angry, 
bitter maybe because you were 
about to be married — but you go. 
Take ft from there and I think 
you have a storv. I called it VOYAGE TO ETERNITY. 

Those were the birth-pangs of 
this particular science fiction story. 
But because science-fiction is such 
a wide, diversified field, you could 



om Page 2) 

go right on writing — a million stories, if you'd like — and never write 
the same one twice. I think, 
though, that science fiction writers essentially are optimists, despite their occasional crack-ofdoom stories. They write about 
the future, which means they think, 
at the very least, that there will 
be a future — and in these troubled 
times, that's a pretty clear cut case 
of optimism. 

Along with a lot of other people, 
I often like to write about the first 
interstellar voyage. In a sense, 
VOYAGE TO ETERNITY tells 
about that. The reason is simple. 
Once mankind gets out to the stars 
and begins to spread out across 
the galaxy, he'll be immortal despite his best — make that worst 
— efforts to destroy himself. You

can destroy a world, maybe a dozen worlds, but spread humanity out 
thin among the stars, colonies here, 
there, and all over, and he's immortal. He'll live as long as there's 
a universe to hold him. 

I know interstellar travel is a 
long way off, but science has a 
way of leaping ahead in geometric, 
not arithmetic progression. A 
hundred years? Perhaps we'll have 
our first starship then. Let's hope 
so. For if man can survive the 
next hundred years — the hardest 



hundred, I believe — he'll reach the 
stars and go on forever. 

So — I'll write about the future 
and keep on hoping, because it 
happens I was born at the beginning of the hard hundred years. 
Man will have a future, though, 
and a magnificent one — if he 
doesn't touch the wrong button 
and blow himself to pieces within 
the next century or so. Because 
I won't be around for that far future, I like to write about it.

TO make it clear how normal 
everything was when the 
evening started out, I'll let 
you in at the time Willy phoned 
me. I was in my apartment with 
a lady from down the hall . . . 

I had asked her what she liked 
and she'd purred, "You." I had 
asked her with soda or gingerale 
and she'd said, "Straight," so I'd 
obliged and poured myself a triple 
too and sank into the sofa beside 
her. 

The phone rang. 

"Oh damn," she said. 

"Your earlobes — " I began. 

"The phone, James." 

"Your shoulders — " 

"James? Don't you think you'd 
better answer it?" 

So I sighed and handed her the 
glass and told her not to hold it 
till I got back or she'd melt the 
ice. I crossed the room to the telephone. 



"City morgue," I said. 

"Uh — unh — " 
"Hullo Willy," I said, recognizing the stammer. 

While he gulped and stuttered 
a couple more times I threw a kiss 
to the lady. She failed to throw 
it back because she was placing a 
bet with herself that Willy was 
short for Wilhelmina. J

lancing, which showed he had 
more business sense than the rest 
of his ilk but which wasTi't doing my position at the agency any 
good. I'd been joed to bag him. 

Which was why I hesitated and 
reconsidered the impulse to brush 
him off. This was the first 'time 
he had definitely asked to see me. 
Sunday midnight is one hell of a 
time to suddenly decide to see a 
dogging agent, but like I said Willy 
was neurotic. So I just tested the 
impulse. 

"Well, Willy," I said, "I'm 
pretty busy at the moment looking after the interests of the agency artists. They always come first, 
you know. Could it wait — " 

"Jim, I've got to see you. It's 
— It's driving me nuts trying to 
figure out what to do." 

"Tax trouble? Or maybe one 
of your models?" 

"No, nothing like that. Listen. 
Will you come over tonight?" 

I let my instincts juggle the 
stress between pleasure and business. Both were practical, wellbalanced personal interests. The 
thunderous night was young and 
the lady had nice earlobes and my 
apartment had that feeling about 
it. On the other hand the little 
fair-haired artist was in a jam and 
if I played fairy godmom bigger 
and better apartments and earlobes were in the offing from the 
agency. 



So I made the mistake of my 
life. 

I said, "I'll be there in half 
an hour," and hung up. 

"Jim - mee," the lady said. She 
was pouting, so I pinched her earlobe and patted her shoulders and 
bemoaned the tyranny of the business world and helped her into her 
coat. She went back to her own 
apartment. I tidied up the place, 
stacked the etchings in their corner, and took a cab outside. 

T tossed that part of it in to make 
it clear that on the face and 
the underneath of it I could be 
readily classed as a normal, practical sort of a guy. 

I am. I shun unnatural, illogical 
things, like mysteries, or falsies, 
or counterfeit bills. Or fourth dimensions. I like an item right, on 
the table where I can eye it and 
touch it and say, "That's a 
spade," or, "That's a buck." If 
there's water on Mars I'll believe 
it when I drink it, but until then 
I'll say, "So what's with Mars? 
It's one hell of a long way off." 

You see what I'm driving at? 
With me, James Gilbert Crisp, 
things are either down to earth 
or they're nowhere. I'd never admit messing around with something I couldn't put my hands on. 
If I touch it, I accept it, and if 
it's willing I'm able. 
"Jim!" said Willy, grabbing my 



THE ANIM; 

hat. "Come in, come in!" 

I grinned at the little guy assuringly and shook the rain from 
my coat and tossed it on an easel. 
He shunted a chair at me and 
seated himself nervously, rubbing 
his neck, on the other side of a 
monster coffee table loaded with 
paints, bottles and oil-stained cartons. I was familiar with this 
studio, the working half of Willy's 
ranch-style chalet. The studio itself was as big as a barn and had 
more windows than walls; rain 
pecked at the glass in the northerly-exposed roof. 

Willy was tidy for an artist. 
Most of the boys on the agency's 
hook have la Boheme delusions 
that class them apart from us 
hucksters; their studios, which we 
see in spite of ourselves, look like 
barns. But Willy's neuroses, although conventional, were bearable because in a lot of ways he 
was practical. He kept things 
where he could put his hands 'on 
them. Like the cigarettes he now 
fished from a box on the coffee 
table labeled 'caseins'. 

I shifted uncomfortably; these 
new-fangled chairs they twist out 
of wire will never replace the Morris. Willy drew furiously on the 
fag he had forgotten to offer me. 
It was taking him longer than 
usual to warm up to his subject. 
I shifted again. 

"What's the problem, Willy?" 



rED PINUP 97 

I asked. 

He jumped, then looked at me 
with his scared-spaniel eyes, butted his smoke and reached for another. Just watching him was 
giving me the heebies, but I flashed my old fairy godmom smile. 

"Jim," he said finally, "I called 
you because, well, you're a practical guy and can face things in a 
practical way. I've got to tell 
somebody about it. I'm — it's 
driving me crazy, Jim." 

I stifled a Jawn and fixed my 
smile and found my mind wandering back to the lady's earlobes. 
Now I'm not against a guy letting 
down his hair, but I was sure that 
with Willy it couldn't possibly 
amount to anymore than another 
fruitless crush on a model. He had 
them frequently, but they always 
fizzled out before the girl got 
around to compromising him. He 
was always a foot short of them, 
but he had money; the usual solution was little more than another 
illo assignment which required a 
horsey model of another color. I'd 
begun to suspect that the cause of 
neuroses in little artists like Willy 
was too many here-now gone-tomorrow beautiful babes. Transference, or something like that. It 
makes them so dizzy they forget 
which is the real entity — the canvas reproduction or the model. 
This and other things like a pithless pituitary loosens the screws,

and then they make from Bohemia. I don't pretend to be a psychologist, but that's the way it 
adds up. 

SO I was half-thinking of getting the lady at the apartment to give Willy a real down-toearth tumble when he started his 
spiel. I must have missed a few 
paragraphs of his monologue, because when I caught up to the subject I was away off base. 

"... so I've got to give it up, 
Jim. If I don't there's no telling 
what it would lead to. You could 
— help me, with your drag at the 
agency you represent. I could 
do account execking, or maybe be 
a consultant art director-withoutportfolio, anything — " 

"Whoa down, Willy," I said, 
startled. "Give up illustrating? 
Just because of a dame — " 

Willy shook his head sadly. 
"She's got nothing to do with 
anything else I draw. She isn't at 
all like the models. Oh, I know 
what a goop I've been about them, 
but Red has cured me." He paused and looked at me quizzically, 
shaking his head. "I knew you 
had a level head, Jim — that's exactly why I've told you this. But 
even so, your reaction — " He 
frowned. His hurt-dog eyes narrowed resentfully. "You don't believe me." 

I cursed myself inwardly for not 



having paid more attention to him, 
but his voice was the kind that 
would put a sympathetic Father 
Confessor to sleep if he concentrater too hard on it. I'd been prepared to let him get it off his 
skinny chest, pat him on the back 
and tell him to leave everything to 
old Jim Fixit. But the quitting 
business was a looper. He was 
too canvas-happy to give it up 
without a fight. 

"Look," I said to cover up the 
fact that my ears had been closed, 
"what you told me may seem unusual to you, but to me it's just 
one of those things that aren't 
quite what they seem. Now, uh — 
go over it again in detail and I'll 
apply myself to it completely from 
your angle this. time. Tell me exactly where Red fits in, and where 
the — uh — trouble started." 

Willy slapped his knees and 
looked even more forlorn, reaching 
for a smoke while he still had one 
in his mouth. "Sorry I doubted 
you, Jim, but you can understand 
how I feel about it. Look — " 

He stood up, butted the fresh 
fag, and walked across the room 
to the drawing desk where he did 
his layouts. 

"The best thing to do is simply 
show you," he said. I sighed and 
dragged my chair over and sat to 
one side of him. He pulled out a 
layout pad, opened his pastels and 
arranged them deliberately beside

it. I wondered how he could 
show me his love-troubles this way, 
unless it was by diagrams. 

"Nothing happens," he said, 
waving a pastel stick under my 
nose, "until I've used the three basic colors and signed the illo. If 
there isn't a balance of the three 
basics it's no good. That's why I 
arranged the pastels that way." 

He naturally assumed I knew 
what he was talking about. It 
meant nothing more to me than a 
freak technique he'd developed. 
That signature business sounded— 
neurotic. 

XJOW this part of my story is 
J-^ important. Until he finished 
that sketch I was the normal, practical guy I was telling you about. 
Nothing fizzed on me unless it 
added up to four and I could feel 
the two and two of it. A buck 
was a buck, a girl was a girl — 
His grey pastel flew over the 
paper and as usual I marvelled at 
how these guys could do it. Like 
the saying goes, all I can draw is 
flies and rubber checks, and frequently a blank. I've seen a lot 
of artists do their stuff, but none 
of them come up to Willy. You've 
seen his illos in most of the big 
slicks — you know, the guy and 
gal in all angles on the yellow 
beach under a pink sky, and the 
story title reads "When Will You 
Come Back, Dearest?", or the cola 



series on the back cover where the 
girl swigs and the guy gawks at 
her bathing suit, that sort of stuff. 
The fat accounts, they all came 
running for Willy. With him on 
the payroll the agency could have 
made a fortune. 

I was considering ways to 
broach this subject so it would tie 
in with the poor guy's dilemma 
when he started working the third 
color into the sketch. Naturally 
it was a dame; he could draw them 
with his eyes shut. The third color went into the bathing suit. He 
smudged chalk on his finger and 
touched the sketch with quick 
strokes, moulding the form, and 
what a form. I leaned forward, and 
half stood over his chair, marvelling at the way he did it. Then, 
applying a dough rubber to pick 
out highlights and stray smudges, 
he leaned back and reached for a 
pencil. Noticing how tensed he 
was, I sank back into my chair 
and lit a cigarette. 

"There," he whispered, his hand 
poised with the pencil at the bottom left-hand corner. 

"So now what gives?" I asked. 
"Is she the—" 

"So now I sign it." He looked 
around at me, spaniel-eyed. I 
gathered that he was reluctant to 
sign it. I wanted him to get on 
with it and explain how it tied in. 
I must have looked impatient. 

"So go ahead," I said. "Sign

it." 

He signed it. 

The girl got up off the paper 
and brushed herself off. 

T FELT the cigarette smoke 
burning my eyes, but was too 
frozen to close them. I must 
have gone as white as the paper 
the girl got up off of. Willy touched my shoulder. I looked Wearily 
at his spaniel eyes, which were 
puzzled. 

"Didn't you believe me?" he 
asked. 

I made a noise in my throat, and 
suddenly wanted desperately to be 
back in my apartment. Anywhere. 
But I knew that if I stood up my 
legs would fold. So I just stared 
at the girl while my heart flopped 
like a beached fish. 

She smiled at me, then turned 
to Willy. 

"Who's your friend?" she asked 
in a voice proportionate to her 
size, which was about a foot. 

Willy looked at his hands. "Just 
a friend." Turning to me he said 
imploringly, "You did believe me, 
didn't you, Jim?" 

I felt like asking him what the 
hell difference it made whether or 
not I'd believed him, but I 
merely swallowed and cleared my 
throat. I worked my jaws. I 
took the cigarette from my mouth 
and looking at it, then at my hand, 
moving it back and forth to adjust 



the focus. I didn't want to do 
any thinking about it because I 
knew I'd be scared senseless by the 
conclusions. So I made my mind 
a throbbing blank and to the cigarette said the first thing that popped into my head. 
"She's pretty." 

The girl smiled coyly and seated herself on the blank layout pad. 

"Of course I'm pretty," she 
said. "I'm Willy's ideal. He 
wouldn't have drawn me if I weren't." She 'blinked her eyes demurely. 

Willy just sat there looking woebegone, so I went along with it. 
"What's your name?" 
"Red." 

, It fitted. The first basic had 
gone into her hair. I felt myself 
beginning to twitch. The reaction 
was setting in again. I found 
myself wishing that Willy would 
do something, and not just sit 
there with his jaw drooping to the 
floor. I wondered if he could erase 
her with his dough rubber. I clung 
to that thought because it seemed 
funny. I started to laugh. The 
girl pouted. Willy looked up at 
me and frowned. 

"What's so funny," Red asked. 

I took a deep breath and gritted my teeth, but the shakes were 
coming and this time they wouldn't be deferred. I wheeled from 
the chair and charged for the door. 
Willy was up and grabbing at my 



THE ANIMATED PINUP 



101 



arm. 

"Don't go, Jim! Please! I've 
only started to — " 

I swung around at him and 
threw his hand off, panic making 
my actions loose. Then I saw his 
spaniel eyes, sad, pleading. I glowered at him and ran my hand 
through my hair. Looking back at 
the pint-sized beauty I socked my 
fist into my hand and stalked back 
to the drawing desk. I reached 
out for her. She squeaked and 
cowered away. 

Willy let out a holler that just 
about scared the pants off both of 
us, and was tugging at my arm 
again. 

"I just want to touch her," I 
roared. "I won't kill her." 

"You touch her like that and 

you will kill her," Willy cried. 

"Sit down, will you? Listen to me 
» 

"If I can feel her with my 
hands," I said, still whoozy but 
cooling down, "I'll believe she's 
there. Otherwise I go home and 
sleep it off." I rubbed my forehead. "This kind of stuff isn't 
for me, kid. You keep your bloody 
mirages — " 

"Please, Jim." 

T SCOWLED and dropped into 
the chair. Willy fumbled for his 
cigarettes and offered one to me 
and then in his nervousness proffered one to the redhead, who had 



held her palms pressed to her ears 
while we shouted at each other. 
Red shook her head, smiling. Willy 
chuckled his embarrassment and 
sat down in the other chair. We 
were both facing the desk but I 
couldn't bring myself to look at 
the girl. 

Suddenly she leapt from the 
desk and was standing in my lap. 
While I groaned and held my 
breath she stretched her arm out. 

"You may touch me, if it will 
make you feel better." 

I glanced at Willy, who nodded, 
and touched the point of my finger to her palm. She was there 
all right. I drew my hand away 
quickly, and she laughed. It sounded precisely like the voice of a fulllength girl coming from another 
room. I studied her with my chin 
resting on my fist, and saw that 
she was indeed a beautiful creature. Full-size, she'd be a knockout; I'd be falling, as the saying 
goes, all over her. But a foot 
high! 

Then I remembered that Willy 
had sketched her. She was a drawing. Tri-dimensional, but nonetheless a figment of Willy's imagination. Yet she was solid. I 
was getting confused again, trying 
to tie it, so to fend off a return 
of the shakes I forced another 
blank into my mind. It was easier, this time. The whole thing was 
so ridiculous it was intriguing. 



102 



IMAGINATION 



"Who is she, Willy?" I asked. 
It was easier to talk to him. 

"Like I told you. Red. My 
dream girl." 

I looked at him. "Yeah. Mhmm." I looked down at Red. 
She was sitting on my kneecap, 
combing her hair. "So just what 
seems to be the problem?" 

His eyes were pathetic. "Again, 
like I told you. I'm too big for 
her." 

"Yeah," I said. "Uh-huh." It 
had to be as simple as that. Something practical-like; for Willy, 
like I said, was basically a practical guy. Or practically a basic 
guy. I frowned at him, for the 
answer was also a simple one. 

"Then why don't you draw her 
full size?" I asked. 

Willy looked miserable. "I do." 

I said, "Mmm?" 

"I do draw her full-size. That's 
Red's full size. Twelve inches." 

I nodded, following his lips. 

"Once," he continued, "I drew 
her a little larger." 

From her perch on my kneecap 
Red said, coolly, "Don't you dare 
try that again." 

"No, dear," Willy said, sadly. 

I rubbed my head. To Willy I 
said, "You can't — project her?" 

Willy started to answer, but 
Red interrupted. She looked piqued. 

"Of course he can't project me. 
That would be a distortion of myself. It wouldn't," she yawned, 



ruffling her red locks, "be me." 

I rubbed my head again. I 
couldn't think of anything to say. 

Willy shifted. "I can draw her 
smaller," he said. "But that 
would make it even worse, of 
course." 

I nodded. "Of course." Because it seemed practical to say it, 
I said it: "But wouldn't that be 
a distortion too?" 

"Of course not," Red said, and 
I had the fleeting impression of 
being faced by a school teacher in 
the minute end of a telescope. 
"Minimized elements are true elements, merely condensed. Maximized elements are bloated, therefore 
distorted." She sniffed. "Any figment knows that." 

I tossed it around in my floundering mind, but it still came out 
the way it sounded. There was 
another silence. I could see that 
the two of them were losing faith 
in my godmaternal fairyhood. So 
just to keep the conversation jogging, I tried another tack. To 
Willy I said: 

"If Red's a figment of your imagination, why didn't you imagine 
her a more practical size in the 
first place?" 

VX7'ILLY chewed on it for a 
" T couple minutes. Red turned away in disgust to leap from 
my kneecap to Willy's. She seated herself primly and began fuss

ing with her infinitesimal nails. 
Willy said, "After all, she does 
have a mind of her own, Jim. She 
wanted to be imagined the size 
she is, so—" He looked at me 
and shrugged. 

"Why," demanded the little 
woman, "should I go up to him? 
Why can't, he come down to me?" 

I was getting riled. "You love 
him, don't you?" 

She frowned. "He loves me, 
doesn't he?" 

This had a familiar feminine 
ring to it which balked pursuit of 
that subject. I wouldn't have believed that Willy possessed such 
a dogmatic objective imagination. 
If I wanted to conjure up a babe 
I'd make sure beforehand that 
she came out the way I whimmed 
her. Red had a mind of her own, 
which was the negative, or feminine, part of Willy's mind. 

All these thoughts popped up in 
my head because I had to keep 
this in a practical light to insure 
against a return of the shakes. If 
I started considering the impractical side of it I'd recognize it in 
its true light, which was unmitigated madness. 

Willy and Red remained silent, 
inferring that I was to carry the 
ball. 

"What I'm dim about, Willy, is 
how this ties in with your professional livelihood. Why do you 
have to give up art?" 



"Isn't it obvious?" 

I shook my head meekly. Willy 
sighed and reached for a pastel 
stick. He sketched quickly on 
the layout pad, first in greys, then 
filling in with the three basics. It 
was a martini glass, and the first 
fcasic was the cherry in it. Then 
he addressed his signature under 
the sketch. 

He picked up the martini glass 
and drained it. 

Looking apologetically at my 
ogle he picked up the pastels 
again and said, "Sorry. Care for 
one?" 

I said sure. You have to go all 
the way or nowhere with these 
things. Besides, a drink might 
stop the rumbling in my stomach. 
"Make it a rye," I said. "Triple." 

He sketched it and signed it 
and handed it to me, and I said, 
"I see what you mean. Everything 
you sketch, huh?" The rye was 
good. 

Willy sighed morosely. "Anything in color. And I made my 
name in color work. I can't do a 
black and white for beans." 

"Why don't you—" 

"Leave off my signature?" He 
smiled wanly. "You know better 
than that, Jim." 

I did. He had a big name, and 
that, as is the way of commerce, 
is what the buyers paid for. Things 
looked hopeless for Willy. We sat. 
Red got up and stretched, then ad

justed her halter, into which Willy 
had put too much imagination. 
She jumped from Willy's knee to 
the drawing desk, and stretched 
out on the pad. Willy looked at 
her hungrily, and she smiled warmly back at him. I was beginning 
to get that "third party" feeling — 
and then it hit me. 

I leaned forward excitedly. "We 
will make a million!" I roared. 

They stared at me. Coolly. I 
went to the hack of the chair 
again. After a few minutes their 
contemptuous stares got my neck. 

"Okay, okay," I muttered. "We 
won't make a million." 

They waited expectantly for a 
compatible solution. To show that 
I was still working on it I started 
talking again. 

"Let's sum up. You and Red 
want to get together. Which is 
only right, because you literally 
belong to each other. Check. But 
you can't, because Red's too small 
and you're too tall." 

"Check," they said simultaneously. I stumbled on. 

"Okay." I addressed Red. "Let's 
take you first. You are your — uh 
■ — natural size. You are satisfied 
with it. You cannot be projected 
up because it would distort you." 

Red nodded. "I would, consider 
it indecent." 

"And anyway, you are satisfied 
with your element. You prefer it 
to Willy's." 



"Immensely more. So would 
Willy." 

"And what is your element?" I 
asked. 

"Willy's mind." 

T IGNORED that because it led 
■*> to the shakes department. I 
turned to Willy. I was getting 
excited. 

"Now, Willy. You are your natural size. You are unsatisfied with 
it, because — uh — your peculiar 
talent is lousing up your profession. What is more, Red's size 
and element is the preference manifested in your mind. Her element 
is doubly preferred, then, as 
against your own, by both of you, 
uh~" 

"Making the preference unanimous," Willy suggested. 

"Right," I said, pushing the 
thing out of my mind now that I'd 
stumbled through it. I spread my 
arms and gave what I hoped was a 
confident smile. 

"There's your answer," I said. 

I got blank looks. 

"It's obvious!" I said to Willy. 
"You go to Red's element!" 

Willy's meager features were 
perplexed, but Red caught the 
idea. She jumped excitedly back 
on her beau's lap. "Don't you 
see what he means, Willy? Draw 
yourself to my size!" 

That is a verbatim report of 
what led up to Willy propping a 



THE ANIM, 

full-length mirror in an easel and 
making a twelve-and-a-half inch 
full-length portrait of himself, 
with me drinking triple ryes while 
Red directed which of Willy's features should manifest the most 
prominence. It was a very good likeness of himself as he might have 
looked had he been the physical 
Adonis his mind pictured him as, 
which was only right, considering 
the element he was journeying to. 
Red insisted he wear a bathing 
suit that more or less matched her 
own. 

When he was finished, he stepped back, naturally, to admire it. 

"That's terrific!" I said, clapping him on the back. 

"Watch on whom you're spilling 
the rye," Red flared. I apologized, 
and in my philanthropic state 
stooped to kiss her. She backed 
away. 

"A kiss for the bride," I said, 
pouting. "That's all." 

She laughed. "You'd swallow 
me." But she approached and 
stood up on tip-toe and bussed my 
nose. 

"Break it up," Willy said, a new 
authority in his voice. "I've got 
to put my signature to the sketch." 
He tapped impatiently. "Red. Lie 
down beside the sketch." 

Red flushed and placed her 
hands on her hips". "Now look 
here, Willy. Don't you go getting 
too big for your boots!" 



rED PINUP ios 

I guffawed. "It's the other way 
'round! He'll be too small for his 
boots." 

This diverted the quarrel enough 
for Willy to give me final instructions, which he did from a prone 
position on the floor. "Is Red 
lying down beside the sketch, 
Jim?" 

"Yup," I said, squinting at the 
once-again two-dimensioned Redhead. 

"Now I'll transfer my mind to 
the sketch. I'll move an arm 
when I'm there." 

He closed his eyes, and a straining expression twisted his features. 

"Am I there yet?" 

"Nope," I said, bringing my 
eyes to focus three inches from the 
sketch. 

A few grunting moments passed. 
"Am I there yet?" 

"Nope," I said, stifling a yawn. 

"Something's wrong," he said. 
I turned to look down at him. His 
straining expression was now from 
thought. I turned back to the layout pad, and jumped. 

"What's taking him so long?" 
Red demanded, sitting up. 

"He can't transfer," I said. 

She gave me the schoolmarm expression, hands on hips. "Haven't 
you killed him yet?" 

"Mmm?" I asked. 

"You've got to kill him, silly!" 

I shook my head. "Unh-unh. 
Not me."

She started to cry. "I thought 
you wanted us to get together!" 

T^EELING like a louse, I turned 
" to look down at Willy. "She 
says I've got to kill you." 
"How?" 

Red had come to the edge of 
the drawing desk. "What does it 
matter, how?" she said sternly. 
"You know perfectly well that the 
only way to get rid of the body 
you're in is to die." She looked 
back at me. "What are you waiting for?" 

I rubbed my head. "Somehow it 
doesn't seem — " 

She sat back and wailed. Willy 
jumped from the floor and cupped her tenderly in his hands. 
"Don't cry, sweet. After all, it is 
asking a lot of Jim." 

"He gave us the solution," she 
cried, "and now he's backing out 
of his part in it!" 

"Well," said Willy, "he wasn't 
expected to know he'd have to kill 
me—" 

"How else can- you leave the 
body you're in?" she sobbed. 
"What did he expect you'd do? Occupy two bodies at the same 
time?" 

Willy looked at me. I shrugged. 
"Have to confess I hadn't thought 
of it," I muttered, only half aware 
that they had me over a barrel. I 
was half tempted to ask Willy to 
fill my rye glass with pastels again, 



but it seemed an imposition at the 
moment. 

"Oh, what the hell," I said committingly. "I'm not the kind of 
guy to let a friend down over a 
technicality! " 

Red leapt to my lap and clambered up my shirtfront. "I knew 
you wouldn't let us down!" she 
said happily, and bussed my chin. 
Before I could be modest about it 
she had bounded to the desk-top 
and was stretching herself out beside Willy's drawing of himself. 
Willy and I stared from her to 
each other. 

"Well," Willy said. "Let's get 
to it." 

I won't elaborate on the details 
on my act of friendship. I killed 
Willy in as gentle a manner as 
possible, and when I turned back 
to the layout, pad they were sitting there embracing. Willy-theFigment stood up proudly and extended his hand, the one Red wasn't clinging to. 

"Thanks, Jim," he said, when I 
had shaken it warmly with my 
finger-tip. "I knew when I phoned 
you tonight that you were just the 
one who would come up with an 
unselfish, practical solution to my 
dilemma. I'd like to say — " 

"Oh, come on, come on, Willy," 
Red said impatiently, pulling him 
back to the pad. "Jim knows 
how much we appreciate his help. 
Come on!" 



THE ANIM 

"Oh, very well," said Willy, 
winking at me. I winked back. 
"Lucky sti— " I began, but then 
remembered Willy's corpse. That 
brought a nagging thought to my 
mind, but Willy and Red were lying side-by side, half submerged in 
their second dimension, and Red 
was beckoning impatiently, pointing to the dough rubber beside her. 

"Hurry up," she said. "Rub us 
out." 

I rubbed them out. 

Willy's body vanished from the 
floor as I dropped the eraser. And 
just as suddenly I was sober. Cold, 
shaking sober. 

Where was Willy? I looked 
around the room. Nobody but me. 
Me and my delirium tremens. 

I got out of that apartment fast 
and headed for a long line of 
drinks. I had a big case of murder to wash away. Or did I? . . . 



TED PINUP 107 

... So you see, that's how it 
is. Willy's gone, and nobody knows 
where. Nobody but me. And I 
don't know either. I keep thinking of what Red said about her 
"fourth dimension" world. X think 
about it a lot. 

I've given up my job at the 
agency. My apartment too. I got 
a new one. Willy's. It's just as 
it was that night. Right down to 
the last pastel and brush. It's going to stay that way too. Everything just as it was. Every gadget 
that Willy used in his work. 

I've got a use for everything in 
that apartment. I've got to know 
what happened. And there's only 
one real way to find out. 

I spend my days thinking about 
my ideal woman. Each day she 
gets more vivid in my mind. 

My evenings are spent at Art 
School. I'm learning fast . . .

NATIVE SON 



Zl. 2). ~J4amm 

Tommy hated Earth, knowing his mother 
might go home to Mars without him. Worse, 
would a robot secretly take her place? ... 



TOMMY Benton, on -his first 
visit to Earth, found the 
long-anticipated wonders of 
twenty-first century New York 
thrilling the first week, boring and 
unhappy the second week, and at 



the end of the third he was definitely ready to go home. 

The never-ending racket of traffic was torture to his abnormally 
acute ears. Increased atmospheric 
pressure did funny things to his 



109 



no 



IMAGINATION 



chest and stomach. And quick 
and sure-footed on Mars, he struggled constantly against the heavy 
gravity that made all his movements clumsy and uncoordinated. 

The endless canyons of towering 
buildings, with their connecting 
skywalks, oppressed and smothered 
him. Remembering the endless 
vistas of rabbara fields beside a 
canal that was like an inland sea, 
homesickness flooded over him. 

He hated the people who stared 
at him with either open or hidden 
amusement. His Aunt Bee, for 
instance, who looked him up and 
down with frank disapproval and 
said loudly, "For Heavens sake, 
Helen! Take him to a good tailor 
and get those bones covered up!" 

Was it his fault he was six inches taller than Terran boys his age, 
and had long, thin arms and legs? 
Or that his chest was abnormally 
developed to compensate for an 
oxygen-thin atmosphere? I'd like 
to see her, he thought fiercely, 
out on the Flatlands; she'd be 
gasping like a canal-fish out of 
water. 

Even his parents, happily riding 
the social merry-go-round of Terra, after eleven years in the Martian flatlands, didn't seem to understand how he felt. 

"Don't you like Earth, Tommy?" queried his mother anxious
ly. 

"Oh . . . it's all right, I guess." 



"... 'A nice place to visit' . . ." 
said his father sardonically. 

"... 'but I wouldn't live here 
if they gave me the place!' . . ." 
said his mother, and they both 
burst out laughing for no reason 
that Tommy could see. Of course, 
they did that lots of times at 
home and Tommy laughed with 
them just for the warm, secure 
feeling of belonging. This time 
he didn't feel like laughing. 

"When are we going home?" he 
repeated stubbornly. 

His father pulled Tommy over 
in the crook of his arm and said 
gently, "Well, not right away, 
son. As a matter of fact, how 
would you like to stay here and 
go to school?" 

Tommy pulled away and looked 
at him incredulously. 

"I've been to school!" 

"Well, yes," admitted his father. 
"But only to the colony schools. 
You don't want to grow up and 
be* an ignorant Martian sandfoot 
all your life, do you?" 

"Yes, I do! I want to be a Martian sandfoot. And I want to go 
home where people don't look at 
me and say, 'So this is your little 
Martian!' " 

Benton, Sr., put his arm around 
Tommy's stiffly resistant shoulders. "Look here, old man," he 
said persuasively. "I thought you 
wanted to be a space engineer. 
You can't do that without an edu


NATIVE SON 



cation you know. And your Aunt 
Bee will take good care of you." 

Tommy faced him stubbornly. 
"I don't want to be any old spaceman. I want to be a sandfoot like 
old Pete. And I want to go 
home." 

Helen bit back a smile at the 
two earnest, stubborn faces so 
ridiculously alike, and hastened to 
avert the gathering storm. 

"Now look, fellows. Tommy's 
career doesn't have to be decided 
in the next five minutes . . . after 
all, he's only ten. He can make 
up his mind later on if he wants 
to be an engineer or a rabbara 
farmer. Right now, he's going to 
stay here and go to school . . . 
and I'm staying with him." 

Resolutely avoiding both crestfallen faces, Helen, having shepherded Tommy to bed, returned to 
the living room acutely conscious 
of Big Tom's bleak, hurt gaze at 
her back. 

"Helen, you're going to make 
a sissy out of the boy," he said at 
last. "There isn't any reason 
why he can't stay here at home 
with Bee." 

Helen turned to face him. 

"Earth isn't home to Tommy. 
And your sister Bee told him he 
ought to be out playing football 
with the boys instead of hanging 
around the house." 

"But she knows the doctor said 
he'd have to take it easy for a year 



till he was accustomed to the 
change in gravity and air-pressure," he answered incredulously. 

"Exactly. She also asked me," 
Helen went on grimly, "if I 
thought he'd be less of a freak as 
he got older." 

Tom Benton swore. "Bee always did have less sense than the 
average hen," he gritted. "My 
son a freak! Hell's-bells!" 

Tommy, arriving at the hall 
door in time to hear the tail-end 
of the sentence, crept back to bed 
feeling numb and dazed. So even 
his father thought he was a freak. 

'T'HE last few days before parting was one of strain for all of 
them. If Tommy was unnaturally 
subdued, no one noticed it; his 
parents were not feeling any great 
impulse toward gaiety either. 

They all went dutifully sightseeing as before; they saw the 
Zoo, and went shopping on the 
Skywalks, and on the last day 
wound up at the great showrooms 
of "Androids, Inc." 

Tommy had hated them on 
sight; they were at once too human and too inhuman for comfort. 
The hotel was full of them, and 
most private homes had at least 
one. Now they saw the great incubating vats, and the processing 
and finally the showroom where 
one of the finished products was 
on display as a maid, sweeping 



112 



IMAGINATION 



and dusting. 

"There's one that's a dead-ringer for you, Helen. If you were a 
little better looking, that is." Tommy's dad pretended to compare 
them judicially. Helen laughed, 
but Tommy looked at him with a 
resentfulness. Comparing his mother to an Android . . . 

"They say for a little extra you 
can get an exact resemblance. 
Maybe I'd better have one fixed 
up like you to take back with me," 
Big Tom added teasingly. Then 
as Helen's face clouded over, "Oh, 
hon, you know I was only kidding. 
Let's get out of here; this place 
gives me the collywobbles. Besides, 
I've got to pick up my watch." 

But his mother's face was still 
unhappy and Tommy glowered sullenly at his father's back all the 
way to the watch-shop. 

It was a small shop, with an 
inconspicuous sign down in one 
corner of the window that said 
only, "KRUMBEIN-watches", and 
was probably the most famous 
shop of its kind in the world. Every spaceman landing on Terra 
left his watch to be checked by 
the dusty, little old man who was 
the genius of the place. Tommy 
ranged wide-eyed about the clock 
and chronometer crammed interior. 
He stopped fascinated before the 
last case. In it was a watch . . . 
but, what a watch! Besides the 
regulation Terran dial, it had a 



second smaller dial that registered 
the corresponding time on Mars. 
Tommy's whole heart went out to 
it in an ecstasy of longing. He 
thought wistfully that if you could 
know what time it was there, you 
could imagine what everyone was 
doing and it wouldn't seem so far 
away. Haltingly, he tried to explain. 

"Look, Mom," he said breathlessly. "It's almost five o'clock 
at home. Douwie will be coming 
up to the barn to be fed. Gosh, do 
you suppose old Pete will remember about her?" 

His mother smiled at him reassuringly. "Of course he will, 
silly. Don't forget he was the one 
who caught and tamed her for 
you." 

Tommy gulped as he thought of 
Douwie. Scarcely as tall as himself; the big, rounded, mouselike 
ears, and the flat, cloven pads 
that could carry her so swiftly 
over the sandy Martian flatlands. 
One of the last dwindling herds of 
native Martian douwies, burdencarriers of a vanished race, she 
had been Tommy's particular pride 
and joy for the last three years. 

Behind him, Tommy heard his 
mother murmur under her breath, 
"Tom ... the watch; could we?" 

And his Dad regretfully, "It's 
a pretty expensive toy for a 
youngster, Helen. And even a 
rabbara raiser's bank account has 



NATIVE SON 



limits," 

"Of course, dear; it was silly of 
me." Helen smiled a little ruefully. "And if Mr. Krumbein has 
your watch ready, we must go. 
Bee and some of her friends are 
coming over, and it's only a few 
hours 'till you . . . leave." 

Big Tom squeezed her elbow 
gently, understanding^, as she 
blinked back quick tears. Trailing 
after them, Tommy saw the little 
by-play and his heart' ached. The 
guilt-complex building up in him 
grew and deepened. 

He knew he had only to say, 
"Look, I don't mind staying. Aunt 
Bee and I will get along swell," and 
everything would be all right again. 
Then the terror of this new and 
complex world ■ — as it would be 
without a familiar face — swept 
over him and kept him silent. 

His overwrought feelings expressed themselves in a nervously 
rebelling stomach, culminating in 
a disgraceful moment over the 
nearest gutter. The rest of the 
afternoon he spent in bed recuperating. 

In the living room Aunt Bee 
spoke her mind in her usual, highpitched voice. 

"It's disgraceful, Helen. A boy 
his age . . . None of the Bentons 
ever had nerves." 

His mother's reply was inaudible, but on the heels of his father's deeper tones, Aunt Bee's 



voice rose in rasping indignation. 

"Well! I never! And from my 
own brother, too. From now on 
don't come to me for "help with 
your spoiled brat. Good-^vcl" 

The door slammed indignantly, 
his mother chuckled, and there was 
a spontaneous burst of laughter. 
Tommy relaxed and lay back happily. Anyway, that was the last of 
Aunt Bee! 

npHE next hour or two passed in 
■*■ a flurry of ringing phones, people coming and going, and last 
minute words and reminders. Then 
suddenly it was time to leave. Dad 
burst in for a last quick hug and a 
promise to send him pictures of 
Douwie and her foal, due next 
month; Mother dropped a hasty 
kiss on his hair and promised to 
hurry back from the Spaceport. 
Then Tommy was alone, with a 
large, painful lump where his heart 
ought to be. 

The only activity was the almost noiseless buzzing as the lintel 
android ran the cleaner over .the 
living room. Presently even that 
ceased, and Tommy lay relaxed 
and inert, sleepily watching the 
curtains blow in and out at the 
open window. Thirty stories above 
the street the noises were pleasantly muffled and remote, and his 
senses drifted aimlessly to and fro 
on the tides of half-sleep. 

Drowsily his mind wandered 



IMAGINATION 



114 

from the hotel's android servants 
... to the strictly utilitarian mechanical monstrosity at home, 
known " affectionately as "Old 
John" ... to the android showroom where they had seen the one 
that Dad said looked like Mother 

He jolted suddenly, sickeningly awake. Suppose, his mind whispered treacherously, suppose that 
Dad had ordered one to take 
Mom's place . . . not on Mars, 
but here while she returned to 
Mars with him. Suppose that instead of Mom he discovered one 
of those Things ... or even worse, 
suppose he went on from day to 
day not even knowing . . . 

It was a bad five minutes; he 
was wet with perspiration when he 
lay back on his pillows, a shaky 
smile tugging at the corners of his 
mouth. He had a secret defense 
against the Terror. He giggled a 
little at the thought of what Aunt 
Bee would say if she knew. 

And what had brought him back 
from the edge of hysteria was the 
triumphant knowledge that with 
the abnormally acute hearing bred 
in the thin atmosphere of Mars, 
no robot ever created could hide 
from him the infinitesimal ticking 



of the electronic relays that gave 
it life. Secure at last, his overstrung nerves relaxed and he slid 
gratefully over the edge of sleep. 

He woke abruptly, groping after some vaguely remembered 
sound. A soft clicking of heels 
down the hall ... Of course, his 
mother back from the Spaceport! 
Now she would be stopping at his 
door to see if he were asleep. He 
lay silently; through his eyelashes 
he could see her outlined in the 
soft light from the hall. She was 
coming in to see if he was tucked 
in. In a moment he would jump 
up and startle her with a hug, as 
she leaned over him. In a moment . . . 

Screaming desperately, he was 
out of bed, backing heedlessly 
across the room. He was still 
screaming as the low sill of the 
open window caught him behind 
the knees and toppled him thirty 
stories to the street. 

Alone in the silent room, Helen 
Benton stood dazed, staring 
blindly at the empty window. 

Tommy's parting gift from his 
father slid from her hand and lay 
on the carpet, still ticking gently. 

It was 9:23 on Mars.

THE exciting forthcoming film 
H. G. Wells' "War of the 
Worlds", brings out a theme whose 
importance often isn't appreciated 
— the defense of the Earth against 
extra-terrestrial invaders. Wells' 
Martians invade the Earth and almost conquer it, a familiar, classic tale, but the invaders succumb 
to Earth's irresistible defenses — bacteria ! 

The idea of course isn't new — 
wasn't new, even when Wells wrote 
his classic — but it is actually an 
extremely important idea. Any possible extra-terrestrials who might 
invade Earth, regardless of the 
level of their technology, would 



likely find in our incredibly proliferous — and deadly — bacteria, 
more than their match. 

This idea of native bacteria being hostile to invaders is two-edged 
of course. Scientists theorize that 
when men reach the planets it is 
possible — even likely — that if they 
encounter no other life-form, they 
are almost certain to meet with 
Nature's lowest type, the bacterium. And so subtle and damaging 
can these be, that they may constitute a perfect barrier to colonization. It is comforting to think 
that similarly the Earth is protected !

Adharan space ships had no authority 
to prospect earth-controlled stellar systems. 
But what bothered the Galactic Patrol even 
more was the fact they were finding valuable 
treasure on worlds Earthmen had found barren! 




££TT7 HAT kind of ship is 
YY it?" Captain Shure 
demanded, staring fixedly at the viewscreen, his hands 
gripping the fine adjustment. 

Navigator Nelson peered over 
his shoulder. "Wait a minute." 
He swung the control camera over 
and snapped a photograph from 
the screen. The photograph disappeared down the message tube to 
the chart room. "Keep calm. 
We'll get a determination from 
Barnes." 

"What are they doing here? 
What are they after? They must 
know the Sirius system is closed." 




"Notice the balloon sides." Nelson traced the screen with his finger. "It's a freighter. Look at 
the bulge. It's a cargo carrier." 

"And while you're looking, notice that." Shure whirled the enlarger. The image of the ship 
bloated, expanding until it filled the 
screen. "See that row of projections?" 

"So?" 

"Heavy guns. Countersunk. For 
deep-space firing. It's a freighter, 
but it's also armed." 

"Pirates, maybe." 

"Maybe." Shure toyed with the 
communications mike. "I'm tempt

ed to put a call back to Terra." 
"Why?" 

"This may be a scout." 

Nelson's eyes flickered. "You 
think they're in the process of 
sounding us out? But if there are 
more, why don't our screens pick 
them up?" 

"The rest may be out of range." 

"More than two light years? I 
have the screens up to maximum. 
And they're the best screens available." 

The determination popped up 
the tube from the chart room, 
skidding out on the table. Shure 
broke it open and scanned it rapidly. He passed it to Nelson. 
"Here." 

The ship was Adharan design. 
First-class, from a recent freighter 
group. Barnes had noted in his 
own hand: "But not supposed to 
be armed. Must have added the 
cannon. Not standard equipment 
on Adharan freighters." 

"Then it's not bait," Shure murmured. "We can rule that out. 
What's the story on Adhara? Why 
would an Adharan ship be in the 
Sirius system? Terra has closed 
this whole region off for years. 
They must know they can't trade 
here." 

"No one knows much about Adharans. They participated in the 
All-galaxy Trade Conference, but 
that's all." 

"What race are they?" 



"Arachnid type. Typical of this 
area. Based on the Great Murzim 
Stem. They're a variant of the Murzim original. They keep mostly to 
themselves. Complex social structure, very rigid patterns. Organicstate grouping." 

"You mean they're insects." 

"I suppose. In the same sense 
we're lemurs." 

Shure turned his attention back 
to the viewscreen. He reduced 
magnification, watching intently. 
The screen followed the Adharan 
ship automatically, maintaining a 
direct alignment with it. 

'""pHE Adharan ship was heavy 
and black, awkward in comparison to the sleek Terran cruiser. It 
bulged like a well-fed worm, its 
somber sides swollen almost to a 
full sphere. An occasional guide 
light blinked on and off as the 
ship approached the outermost 
planet of the Sirius system. It moved slowly, cautiously, feeling its 
way along. It entered the orbit of 
the tenth planet and began maneuvering for descent. Brake jets 
burst on, flashing red. The bloated 
worm drifted down, lowering itself 
toward the surface of the planet. 

"They're landing," Nelson murmured. 

"That's fine. They'll be stationary. Good target for us." 

On the surface of the tenth planet the Adharan freighter lay rest


THE COSMIC POACHERS 



ing, its jets dying into silence. 
A cloud of exhaust particles rose 
from it. The freighter had landed between two mountain ranges, 
on a barren waste of gray sand. 
The surface of the tenth planet 
was utterly barren. No life, atmosphere or water existed. The 
planet was mostly rock, cold gray 
rock, with vast shadows and pits, 
a corroded sickly surface, hostile 
and bleak. 

Abruptly the Adharan ship came 
to life. Hatches popped open. 
Tiny black dots rushed from the 
ship. The dots increased in number, a flood of specks pouring out 
of the freighter, scurrying across 
the sand. Some of them reached 
the mountains and disappeared 
among the craters and peaks. Others gained the far side, where they 
were lost in the long shadows. 

"I'll be damned," Shure muttered. "It doesn't make sense. 
What are they after? We've gone 
over these planets with a fine tooth 
comb. There's nothing anyone 
would want, down there." 

"They may have different wants, 
Or different methods." 

Shure stiffened. "Look. Their 
cars are coming back to the ship.'-' 

The black dots had reappeared, 
emerging from the shadows and 
craters. They hurried back toward the mother worm, racing 
across the sand. The hatches 
opened. One by one the cars 



popped into the ship and disappeared. A few belated cars made 
their way to the ship and entered. 
The hatches clamped shut. 

"What in hell could they have 
found?" Shure said. 

Communications Officer Barnes 
entered the control room, craning 
his neck. "Still down there? Let 
me have a look. I've never seen 
an Adharan ship." 

On the surface of the planet the 
Adharan ship stirred. Suddenly it 
shuddered, quivering from stem to 
stern. It rose from the surface, 
gaining altitude rapidly. It headed 
for the ninth planet. For a time 
it circled the ninth planet, observing the pitted, eroded surface below. Empty basins of dried-up 
oceans stretched out like immense 
pie pans. 

The Adharan ship selected one 
of the basins and settled down to 
a landing, blowing clouds of exhaust up into the sky. 

"The same damn thing again," 
Shure murmured. 

Hatches opened. Black specks 
leaped out onto the surface and 
rushed off in all directions. 

Shure's jaw jutted out angrily. 
"We have to find out what they're 
after. Look at them go! They 
know exactly what they're doing." 
He grabbed up the communication 
mike. Then he dropped it. "We 
can handle this alone. We won't 
need Terra." 



120 



IMAGINATION 



"It's armed, don't forget." 

"We'll catch it as it lands. 
They're stopping at each planet 
in order. We'll go all the way in 
to the fourth planet." Shure moved rapidly, bringing the command 
chart into position. "When they 
land on the fourth planet we'll be 
there waiting for them." 

"They may put up a fight." 

"Maybe. But we have to find 
out what they're loading. They're 
finding something — and whatever 
it is, it belongs to us." 

npHE Fourth Planet of the Sirius System had an atmosphere, 
and some water. Shure landed his 
cruiser in the ruins of an ancient 
city, long deserted. 

The Adharan freighter had not 
appeared. Shure scanned the sky 
and then raised the main hatch. 
He and Barnes and Nelson stepped outside cautiously, armed with 
heavy-duty Slem rifles. Behind 
them the hatch slammed back in 
place and the cruiser took off, 
roaring up into the sky. 

They watched it go, standing 
together with their rifles ready. The 
air was cold and thin. They could 
feel it blowing around their pressure suits. 

Barnes turned up the temperature of his suit. "Too cold for 
me." 

"Makes you realize we're still 
Terrans, even though we're light 



years from home," Nelson said. 

"Here's the outline," Shure said. 
"We can't blast them. That's out. 
We're after their cargo. If we 
blast them we'll blast the cargo 
along with them." 

"What'll we use?" 

"We'll shoot a vapor cloud 
around them." 

"A vapor cloud? But — " 

"Captain," Nelson said, "We 
can't use a vapor cloud. We won't 
be able to get near them until the 
vapor has become inert." 

"There's a wind. The vapor will 
dissipate very quickly. Anyhow, it's 
all we can do. We'll have to take 
the chance. As soon as the Adharan 
is sighted, we must be ready to 
open fire." 

"What if the cloud misses?" 

"Then we're in for a fight." 
Shure studied the sky intently. "I 
think it's coming. Let's go." 

They hurried to a hill of piled 
up rocks, remains of columns and 
towers heaped in great mounds, 
mixed with debris and rubble. 

"This will do." Shure crouched 
down, his Slem rifle held tightly. 
"Here they come." 

The Adharan ship had appeared 
above them. It was preparing to 
land. Down it settled, its jets 
roaring, exhaust particles rising. 
With a crash it struck the ground, 
bouncing a little and finally coming to rest. 

Shure gripped his phone. "Okay." 



THE COSMIC POACHERS 



121 



Above them in the sky the cruiser appeared, sweeping down over 
the Adharan. From the cruiser a 
blue^white cloud shot, drilled out 
by pressure jets directly at the 
black Adharan ship. The cloud 
reached the parked freighter. It 
billowed around it, fusing into it. 

The surface of the Adharan hull 
glowed briefly. It began to fall 
in, eaten away. Corroded. The 
Terran cruiser swept past, completing its run. It disappeared into the sky. 

' From the Adharan ship figures 
were emerging, jumping out onto 
the ground. The figures sprang in 
all directions, long-legged, leaping 
wildly around. Most of the figures hopped excitedly up onto their 
ship, dragging hoses and equipment, working frantically, disappearing into the vapor cloud. 

"They're spraying." 

More Adharans appeared, leaping frantically up and down, onto their ship, onto the ground, some 
this way, others in no particular 
direction at all. 

"Like when you step on an ant 
hill," Barnes murmured. 

The hull of the Adharan ship 
was covered with clinging Adharans, spraying desperately, trying 
to halt the corrosive action of the 
vapor. Above them the Terran 
cruiser reappeared, entering a second run. It grew, swelling from a 
dot into a tear-shaped needle, 



flashing in the sunlight from Sirius. The freighter's bank of guns 
jutted up desperately, trying to 
align themselves with the swiftly 
moving cruiser. 

"Bomb close by," Shure ordered 
into his phone. "But no direct hits. 
I want to save the cargo." 

The cruiser's bomb racks opened. Two bombs fell, singing down 
in an expert arc. They straddled 
the inert freighter, bursting on 
both sides. Towering clouds of 
rock and debris rose up, billowing 
over the freighter. The black worm 
shuddered, Adharans sliding off 
the hull onto the ground. The 
bank of guns fired a few futile 
blasts as the cruiser swept past 
and disappeared. 

"They haven't got a chance," 
Nelson murmured. "They can't 
leave the ground until they've got 
their hull sprayed." 

Most of the Adharans were beginning to flee from their ship, 
scattering onto the ground. 

"It's almost over," Shure said. 
He got to his feet and stepped out 
from the ruins. "Let's go." 

Ai white flare burst up from the 
Adharan, showering sparks in the 
sky. The Adharans milled aimlessly around, confused by the attack. 
The cloud of vapor had virtually 
dissipated. The flare was the 
conventional signal of capitulation. The cruiser was circling again, 
above the freighter, waiting for 



122

orders from Shure. 

"Look at them," Barnes said. 
"Insects, big as people." 

"Come on!" Shure said impatiently. "Let's go. I'm anxious to 
see what's inside." 

"TPHE Adharan commander met 
them outside its ship. It 
moved toward them, apparently 
dazed from the attack. 

Nelson and Shure and Barnes 
gazed at it in revulsion. "Lord," 
Barnes muttered. "So that's what 
they're like." 

The Adharan stood almost five 
feet tall, enclosed in a black chitin 
shell. It stood on four slender 
legs, two more weaving uncertainly half-way up its body. It wore 
a loose belt, holding its gun and 
equipment. Its eyes were complex, 
multi-lensed. Its mouth was a 
narrow slit at the base of its elongated skull. It had no ears. 

Behind the Adharan commander a group of crew members stood 
uncertainly, some of them withweapon tubes partly raised. The 
Adharan commander made a series 
of sharp clicks with its mouth, 
waving its antennae. The other 
Adharans lowered their tubes. 

"How is communication with 
this race possible?" Barnes asked 
Nelson. 

Shure moved forward. "It 
doesn't matter. We have nothing 
to say to them. They know they 



are illegally here. It's the cargo 
we're interested in." 

He pushed past the Adharan 
commander. The group of Adharans made way for him. He entered the ship, Nelson and Barnes 
following after him. 

The interior of the Adharan ship reeked and dripped 
with slime. The passages were 
narrow and dark, like long tunnels. The floor was slippery underfoot. A few crew members 
scuttled around in the darkness, 
their claws and antennae waving 
nervously. Shure flashed his light 
down one of the corridors. 

"This way. It looks like the 
main passage." 

The Adharan commander followed close behind them. Shure 
ignored him. Outside, the cruiser 
had landed nearby. Nelson could 
see Terran soldiers standing around 
on the surface. 

Ahead of them a metal door 
closed off the corridor. Shure indicated the door, making an opening motion. 

"Open it." 

The Adharan commander retreated, making no move to open the 
door. A few more Adharans scuttled up, all of them with weapon 
tubes. 

"They may fight yet," Nelson 
said calmly. 

Shur raised his Slem rifle at 
the door. "I'll have to blast it." 



THE COSM] 

The Adharans clicked excitedly. 
None of them approached the door. 

"All right," Shure said grimly. 
He fired. The door dissolved, 
smoking into ruins. It sank down, 
leaving an opening wide enough to 
pass through. The Adharans 
rushed around wildly, clicking to 
each other. More of them left the 
hull and poured into the ship, flocking around the three Terrars. 

"Come on," Shure said, stepping 
through the gaping hole. Nelson 
and Barnes followed him, Slem 
rifles ready. 

The passage led down. The air 
was heavy and thick, and as they 
walked down the passage, Adharans pressed behind them. 

"Get back." Shure spun, his 
rifle up. The Adharans halted. 
"Stay back. Come on. Let's go." 

The Terrans turned a corner. 
They were in the hold. Shure advanced cautiously, moving with 
care. Several Adharan guards 
stood with drawn weapon tubes. 

"Get out of the way." Shure 
waved his Slem rifle. Reluctantly, 
the guards moved aside. "Come 
on!" 

The guards separated. Shure 
advanced. 
And stopped, amazed. 

T)EFORE them was the cargo of 
the ship. The hold was halffilled with carefully stacked orbs 
of milky fire, giant jewels like im


POACHERS 123 

mense pearls. Thousands of them. 
As far back as they could see. Disappearing back into the recesses of 
the ship, endless stacks of them. 
All glowing with a soft radiance, 
an inner illumination tljat lit up 
the vast hold of the ship. 

"Incredible!" Shure muttered. 

"No wonder they were willing to 
slip in here without permission." 
Barnes took a deep breath, his 
eyes wide. "I think I'd do the 
same. Look at them! " 

"Big, aren't they?" Nelson said. 

They glanced at each other. 

"I've never seen anything like 
it," Shure said, dazed. The Adharan guards were watching them 
warily, their weapon tubes ready. 
Shure advanced toward the first 
row of jewels, stacked neatly with 
mathematical precision. "It doesn't 
seem possible. Jewels piled up 
like— like a warehouse full of doorknobs." 

"They may have belonged to the 
Adharans at one time," Nelson 
said thoughtfully. "Maybe they 
were stolen by the city-builders of 
the Sirius system. Now they're 
getting them back." 

"Interesting," Barnes said. 
"Might explain why the Adharans 
found them so easily. Perhaps 
charts or maps existed." 

Shure grunted. "In any case 
they're ours, now. Everything in 
the Sirius system belongs to Terra. 
It's all been signed, sealed and 



124 



IMAGINATION 



agreed on." 

"But if these were originally 
stolen from the Adharans—" 

"They shouldn't have agreed to 
the closed-system treaties. They 
have their te own systems. This belongs to Terra." Shure reached up 
toward one of the jewels. "I wonder how it feels." 

"Careful, Captain. It may be 
radioactive." 

Shure touched one of the jewels. 

The Adharans grabbed him, 
throwing him back. Shure struggled. An Adharan caught hold of 
his Slem rifle and twisted it out 
of his hands. 

Barnes fired. A group of Adharans puffed out of existence. 
Nelson was down on one knee, firing at the passage entrance. The 
passage was choked with Adharans. 
Some were firing back. Thin heat 
beams cut over Nelson's head. 

"They can't get us," Barnes 
gasped. "They're afraid to fire. 
Because of the jewels." 

The Adharans were retreating 
into the passage, away from the 
hold. Those with weapons were 
being ordered back by the commander. 

Shure snatched Nelson's rifle 
and blasted a knot of Adharans 
into particles. The Adharans were 
closing the passage. They rolled 
heavy emergency plates into position and welded them rapidly in


to place. 

"Burn a hole," Shure barked. 
He turned his gun on the wall of 
the ship. "They're trying to seal 
us in here." 

Barnes turned his gun on the 
wall. The two Slem beams ate 
into the side of the ship. Abruptly 
the wall gave way, a circular hole 
falling out. 

/-AUTSIDE the ship Terran soldiers were fighting with the 
Adharans. The Adharans were retreating, making their way back 
as best they could, firing and hopping. Some of them hopped up 
onto their ship. Others turned 
and fled, throwing their guns down. 
They milled about in helpless confusion, running and leaping in all 
directions, clicking wildly. 

The parked cruiser glowed into 
life, its heavy guns lowering into 
position. 

"Don't fire," Shure ordered 
through his phone. "Leave their 
ship alone. It isn't necessary." 

"They're finished," Nelson gasped, jumping onto the ground. Shure 
and Barnes leaped after him, out 
of the Adharan ship onto the surface. "They don't have a chance. 
They don't know how to fight." 

Shure waved a group of Terran 
soldiers over to him. "Over here! 
Hurry up, damn it." 

Milky jewels were spilling out of 
the ship onto the ground, rolling 



THE COSMIC POACHERS 



and bouncing through the hole. 
Part of the containing struts had 
been blasted away. Stacks of jewels cascaded down and rolled 
iaround their feet, getting in their 
way. 

Barnes scooped one up. It 
burned his gloved hand faintly, 
tingling his fingers. He held it to 
the light. The globe was opaque. 
Vague shapes swam in the milky 
fire, drifting back and forth. The 
globe pulsed and glowed, as if it 
were alive. 

Nelson grinned at him. "Really 
something, isn't it?" 

"Lovely." Barnes picked up another. On the hull of the ship an 
Adharan fired down at him futilely. "Look at them all. There 
must be thousands of them." 

"We'll get one of our merchant 
ships here and have them loaded 
up," Shure said. "I won't feel 
safe until they're on their way 
back to Terra." 

Most of the fighting had ceased. 
The remaining Adharans were being rounded up by the Terran soldiers. 

"What about them?" Nelson 
said. 

Shure did not answer. He was 
examining one of the jewels, turning it over and over. "Look at it," 
he murmured. "Brings out different 
^colors each way you hold it. Did 
you ever see anything like it?" 



>~pHE big Terran freighter 
bumped to a landing. Its 
loading hatches dropped down. 
Jitney cars rumbled out, a fleet 
of stubby trucks. The jitney cars crossed to the Adharan ship. Ramps dropped into 
place, as robot scoops prepared 
to go to work. 

"Shovel them up," Silvanus Fry 
rumbled, crossing over to Captain 
Shure. The Manager of Terran 
Enterprises wiped his forehead 
with a red handkerchief. "Astonishing haul, Captain. Quite a find." 
He put out his moist palm and they 
shook. 

"I can't understand how we 
could have missed them," Shure 
said. "The Adharans walked in 
and picked them up. We watched them going from one planet to 
the next, like some sort of honey 
bee. I don't know why our own 
teams didn't find them." 

Fry shrugged. "What does it 
matter?" He examined one of 
the jewels, tossing it up in the 
air and catching it. "I imagine 
every woman on Terra will have 
one of these around her neck — 
or will want one of these around 
her neck. In six months they 
won't know how they ever lived 
without them. That's the way people are, Captain." He put the 
globe into his briefcase, snapping it 
shut. "I think I'll take one home 
to my own wife."

IMAGINATION 



The Adharan commander was 
brought over by a Terran soldier. 
He was silent, clicking nothing. 
The surviving Adharans had been 
stripped of their weapons and allowed to resume work on their 
ship. They had got the hull 
patched and most of the corrosion 
repaired. 

"We're letting you go," Shure 
said to the Adharan commander. 
"We could try you as pirates and 
shoot you, but there wouldn't be 
much point in it. Better tell your 
government to stay out of the Sirius system from now on." 

"He can't understand, you," 
Barnes said mildly. 

"I know. This is a formality. He 
gets the general idea, though." 

The Adharan commander stood 
silently waiting. 

"That's all." Shure waved impatiently toward the Adharan ship. 
"Go on. Take' off. Clear out of 
here. And don't come back." 

The soldier released the Adharan. The Adharan made his way 
slowly back to his ship. He disappeared through the hatch. The 
Adharans working on the hull of 
the ship gathered up their equipment and followed their commander inside. 

The hatches closed. The Adharan ship shuddered, as its jets 
roared into life. Awkwardly it lifted from the surface, rising up into 
the sky. It turned, heading toward 



outer space. 

Shure watched it until it was 
gone. 

"That's that." He and Fry 
walked rapidly toward the cruiser. 
"You think these jewels will attract 
some attention on Terra?" 

"Of course. Is there any doubt?" 

"No." Shure was deep in thought. 
"They got to only five of the ten 
planets. There should be more on 
the remaining inner planets. After 
this load gets back to Terra we can 
begin work on the inner planets. 
If the Adharans found them we 
should be able to." 

Fry's eyes glittered behind his 
glasses. "Fine. I didn't realize 
there would be more." 

"There are." Shure frowned, 
rubbing his jaw. "At least, there 
ought to be." 

"What's wrong?" 

"I can't understand why we 
never found them." 

Fry clapped him on the back. 
"Don't worry!" 

Shure nodded, still deep in 
thought. "But I can't understand 
why we never found them ourselves. Do you think it means 
anything?"

at his control screen, adjusting his communication circuits.

ed the sound cone to his neck. 

"Bad luck." 

"What occurred?" 

"Terrans attacked us and seized 
the balance of our cargo." 

"How much was still aboard?" 

"Half. We had been to only 
five of the planets." 

"That's unfortunate. They took 
the load to Terra?" 

"I presume." 

Silence for a time. "How warm 
is Terra?" 

"Fairly warm, I understand." 

"Maybe it will work out all 
right. We didn't contemplate any 
hatching on Terra, but if — " 



"I don't like the idea of Terrans 
having a good part of our next 
generation. I'm sorry we hadn't 
gotten farther in the distribution." 

"Don't worry. We'll petition 
the Mother to lay a whole new 
group to make up for it." 

"But what would the Terrans 
want with our eggs? Nothing but 
trouble will come, when hatching 
begins. I can't understand them. 
Terran minds are beyond comprehension. I shudder to think what 
it will be like when the eggs hatch. 
— And on a humid planet, hatching should begin fairly soon . . . "

What made the mass of this 
tiny asteroid fluctuate in defiance of all known physical 
laws? It was an impossible 
fact— but then, so was the girl 
who they knew couldn't exist! 

RED BREWER had plugged 
his electric razor into the lab 
circuit and he was running it 
over his pink jowls while I tried to 
discover what was haywire about 
the balance scales. 

"Have you noticed," Red said 
above the clatter of his shaver, 
"how much less you have to shave 
on an asteroid?" 



IMAGINATION 



"I still shave every day," I said. 
There was something definitely 
wrong with the scales. The ten 
gram weight didn't balance two 
five gram weights. Instead it 
weighed 7.5 grams. And then, 
suddenly, the cockeyed scales 
would get ornery and the two five 
gram weights would weigh 7.5 
grams and the ten gram slug 
would weigh what it should. 

"I don't," said Red. "I shave 
once a week. Back on terra I 
shaved every day, but not here. 
And I don't even have a beard 
to show for it." 

I didn't answer. There were 
tougher problems on my mind than 
whiskers, but of course Red Brew.er wouldn't understand them. He 
was good at machinery, and with 
a camera, and for company on a 
lonely asteroid which right now 
was 300,000,000 miles from the 
earth, but he certainly wasn't a 
brain. 

"What do you make of it, Jay?" 
he asked. "Oh, Mr. Hayling, I'm 
speaking to you." 

"Maybe it's your thyroid," I 
said. "Shut up." 

"I'm twenty-seven," said Red. 
"Too old to have thyroids." 

"You mean adenoids." 

Red growled and shut off the 
razor. He ran his hand over his 
face. "I've got a face like a 
school kid's," he said. "If there 
was only a girl on this god-for


saken piece of rock to see it." 

There were no girls on Asteroid 
57GM. This place didn't have 
anything excepting a lonely shack 
with paper-thin walls made of special heat insulating material. There 
wasn't a blade of grass; not a 
puff of wind; no soil for violets; 
not even a symmetrical shape, it 
was lopsided like a beaten-up baseball. Or at least that was what I 
thought until something happened 
to the balance scales. 

The idea of sending Jay Hayling, 
which is me, and ruddy Red Brewer to Asteroid 57GM, was simply 
to check up on some figures which 
said that this little 10-mile chunk 
of rock didn't have the right mass. 
Twice it had been clocked on near 
passages to Jupiter and twice it 
had behaved differently, as if it 
had suddenly lost some of its mass. 
So Red and I had been sentenced to 
fifteen months alone in space on 
an asteroid just to find out that 
somebody had made a mistake in 
arithmetic. 

The sonar equipment showed 
what kind of rock it was — iron and 
basalt. And I'd made borings 
which checked. We'd tested the 
speed of escape which was a good 
push so we had to be careful, and 
its force of gravity, which wasn't 
much. And then I'd discovered 
that the balance in the lab had a 
habit of being 25 per cent wrong 
one way or the other every time 



THE MINUS WOMAN 



I tried to use it. 

Red put away his razor and 
went through the little door leading to the living quarters. The 
partition was crystal clear plastic 
so I could see him pulling himself 
along by the hand rail toward the 
book case. I knew he would presently find himself something to 
read while I worked. 

T7E seldom walked in the lab" ™ oratory. Our muscles, conditioned by terrestrial gravity, 
were too strong for walking. We'd 
have bumped our heads on the 
ceiling at every step and possibly 
we might even have punched a hole 
in the roof, losing our air. So we 
sort of pulled ourselves along by 
a system of hand rails on all of 
the anchored desks, furniture and 
walls. It was like pulling yourself along the bottom of the ocean 
by hanging onto rocks, since the 
air in the lab w.as dense enough 
to support our almost weightless 
bodies. 

I checked the scales every- way 
I could and finally gave up. I'd 
tackle the problem again tomorrow. Maybe something on the asteroid, some magnetic rock or something, threw it off. I washed my 
hands in the laboratory sink and 
then, while I wiped them on a towel, 
glanced at Red, who was lying on 
his bunk reading. For the first 
time I noticed how skinny he was 



getting. Lack of exercise, I presumed. We were going to have to 
do something to build up our muscles again. I supposed I had lost 
weight just as much as he had. 
It would be tough to weigh ourselves here, since we had only the 
balance in the laboratory. Spring 
scales wouldn't work on the asteroid — we wouldn't have weighed 
enough to register, even though 
our mass was probably about the 
same as an average man's on earth. 

Red put the book aside, closed 
his eyes and smiled. My eyes 
fell on the book for some reason. 
Then suddenly I saw a page flip 
over. I didn't realize at first that 
this couldn't happen. 

There wasn't any draft in the 
place, I was sure of that. A draft 
would mean a leak in the laboratory and alarms would tell us 
when that happened. There was 
no motion, nothing to cause a page 
in the book to turn. 

Another page turned and I was 
sure I wasn't dreaming. I pulled 
myself over to the door, opened it 
a trifle. 

"Red!" I called softly. 

"Dollie!" He was dreaming. 
Dollie was one of the dozen or so 
girls he was always talking about 
in his sleep. 

I pulled myself to his side and 
punched him gently. Red woke 
up. "You're a hell of a guy," he 
said. 



132 



IMAGINATION 



"Yes," I said. "You were dreaming about Dollie. But I saw something happen here and I wanted 
you to see it too." I pointed at 
the book. The pages were still 
now. Suddenly one of them flipped over. 

"Somebody, or something is 
reading your book," I said. 

VI7E didn't figure it out then 
* ' and I wasn't even sure that 
I'd made the right diagnosis, but 
things went on every day afterwards that left me convinced there 
was something else living on this 
hunk of rock besides Red and me. 
It didn't have mass, apparently, 
because we tried our best to touch 
it. 

Once when it got to fooling 
around with the laboratory balance, Red and I encircled the balance with our arms and then 
squeezed together without feeling 
a thing. 

It wasn't energy, because we 
tried every instrument to detect 
electricity, heat, light, and radio. 
But it was alive, because it moved. 
It read books and monkeyed with 
the 'lab scales. 

And at last I decided that maybe it had something to do with the 
apparent discrepancy in the asteroid's change in mass. After that 
I had a great deal to work on. 

Red began behaving queerly 
too. He swore that he was getting 



toe small for his clothing. His shoes, 
he said, were almost a size too 
large. I was too busy to check, 
so I put it down as a loss in 
weight. 

We'd spent a year on the asteroid when we were due to pass 
Mars. So our first anniversary 
was spent in checking our movements with a telescope, a camera 
and a chronometer. We discovered our mass — or that of Asteroid 
57GM — had depreciated another 
25 per cent. It now had only half 
the mass it was supposed to have. 
This was too much of an error 
for even a grade school student. 

"I'll bet some astronomers back 
on earth will get redder than my 
hair when we get home," Red said. 

I shook my head. "It hasn't 
anything to do with their observations," I said. "It's what is 
happening now to you and me. 
We're losing mass someway." 

There was only one way to 
check it and that was to weigh 
ourselves. So I rigged up a rude 
sort of a balance by weighing out 
chunks of rock until we had a mass 
equal to what we should weigh, 
placing them on a teeter-totter arrangement I rigged up in the lab. 

"It'll be close enough to learn 
if we've lost half our mass," I 
said. 

Red showed a weight loss equal 
to about 20 pounds on earth. I 
had gained a little weight. These 



THE MINUS WOMAN 



figures were only relative, and dependent on whether or - not the 
rocks we'd used on the balance had 
lost mass also. But something was 
wrong with Red and I decided to 
watch him carefully. 

"Your scales are cockeyed," Red 
said. "I feel fine. Never felt 
better, in fact. Except that I'm 
lonesome . . . not that I don't enjoy your company, pal, ole pal, 
but I'd like Dollie's better." 

Something on the far side of the 
room caught my eye. It was along 
the glass partition between the lab 
and the living room. It might have 
been a reflection of some sort, because the sun was up and its beams 
were coming right through the 
transparent roof at that moment. 
But for a fleeting instant I thought 
I saw a figure there. A tall, 
shapely, black-haired girl, dressed 
in a flowing robe of orange. The 
next instant she was gone. 

I said I thought it might be a 
reflection, but I was pretty sure it 
wasn't. "Red," I said. "We've 
got company." 

"Huh?" 

"I'm sure of it, Red. There's 
somebody else here besides us." 

"There's no one else. You're 
crazy." Red looked around the 
room. Then he looked at me. 
His gaze was sharp and penetrating. 

"You can't see it now," I said. 
"But I'm sure I saw something. A 
woman. Over there." I pointed 



to where I'd seen the thing that 
might have been a reflection. 

"Maybe you'd better lie down, 
Jay. You've been working too 
hard. A year out on this rock 
could make a man see King Solomon's harem." 

"No, Red," I said. "Those funny things we saw, your book pages 
turning; the cockeyed balance; 
maybe your loss of weight. They 
aren't natural. Something is here 
and what I just saw makes me 
think it's human and it's trying 
to get in touch with us." 

Red's stomach muscles squeezed 
with laughter and he held onto 
a guard rail to keep from being 
sent across the room by the exertion. 

"What I saw was a woman, 
Red," I went on. 

Red laughed out loud and hung 
on again. "I could use a babe," 
he said. Suddenly he jerked. "Who 
hit me?" he asked. Across his 
face was a red- welt, the shape of 
a woman's hand. 

WE called them "manifestations" after that and Red 
called her his ghost sweetheart, although the slap had convinced him 
it wasn't a ghost. Red's getting 
slapped was the first indication 
that perhaps this thing did have 
matter of some sort, but its ability 
to remain invisible made it appear 
that the matter wasn't the ordin

IMAGINATION 



ary kind. 

Finally I came up with some 
sort of an answer. It was just a 
crazy idea and there was no way 
to prove that I was right. I tried 
to explain it to Red, who didn't 
know much about atomic physics, 
but he seemed to get the idea. 

"You see, Red, it could be 
negative matter," I explained. 

"What's that?" 

"Well, you know what an electron is, I suppose, a negatively 
charged sub-atomic particle?" 

Red nodded. 

"And a proton, which is positively charged?" 

Again he nodded. 

"Well, scientists have learned 
that there could be positive electrons, as well as negative, and negative protons. In other words 
each sub-atomic particle has a 
'minus quantity' counterpart." 

"You're saying it, I'm believing 
it," said Red. "A guy's gotta believe something." 

"Well, this leads to a great deal 
of speculation. If these minus 
quantities got together they might 
form a minus matter." 

"You've got me in a hole, so I'm 
minus too." 

"You don't have to understand 
it, but try to imagine that two 
universes could exist side by side, 
one minus, one plus, and that neither could be aware of the other. 
Every star, every planet and ev


ery speck of matter could have its 
counterpart, but neither would be 
aware of that counterpart's existence." 

Red grinned and shook his head. 
"Crazy,-" he said. 

"Yes, crazy. But dig this, supposing that some sixth sense made 
it possible for one of our minus 
counterparts to get in contact 
with us through extra-sensory perception." 

"How'd they do it?" Red asked. 

"I don't know. We don't know 
how to do it, but it may be that 
our scientific progress wouldn't keep 
abreast of each other. We might 
know more than our minus counterparts in some fields, and they 
might know more in others. But 
their special knowledge enabled 
them to bridge the gap briefly — 
long enough to see us, and watch 
us—" 

"And read our books." Red 
nodded. 

"And perhaps learn our language 
— remember you got slapped." 

"I'll watch it," said Red. 

"There's no reason why the gap 
couldn't be bridged. Science and 
minds have done a lot of things that 
looked impossible." 

We went to bed on that and 
all night long I dreamed of negative universes, with suns like old 
Sol except that they shone black 
in bright heavens and planets of 
space floating in vacuums of mat

ter. Red must have dreamed about 
it too, because he had a question 
over the dehydrated ham and eggs 
the next morning. 

"Does that explain the loss in 
mass for this asteroid?" 

"I think it does. Either the 
method our minus counterparts 
have in bridging the gap, or perhaps some sort of space warp that 
permits them to do it. At any 
rate enough of the minus world has 
been projected through to our side 
of the equation to displace the mass 
of this planet. Our lab scales being haywire might be the result of 
a being's nearness to it, or something." 

Red didn't digest it all, but I 
could see he was thinking. "I 
wonder what all this has to do with 
my whiskers," he mused. 

We were busy making some 
further checks on the planetoid's 
mass later in the day when Red got 
a glimpse of the vision I'd seen. 
Red didn't take it quietly. He 
yelled loud and pointed. 

I turned just in time to see her 
fade away. It was the same woman, dressed the same. But this 
time she had been a bit more than 
a vapor. 

Red forgot where be was and 
made a dive toward her. His body 
shot like a bullet across the room, 
skimming over laboratory equipment, and his head crashed solidly 
against the telescope. 



Red literally bounced back halfway again. Then a long thin arm 
seemed to reach out of nowhere 
and seize him by the jacket and 
hold him long enough to stop him. 

Red drifted down to the floor, 
knocked cold. 

TT had happened so swiftly that 
I hadn't had time to move. 
Now I pulled myself toward Red. 
The arm was still there in space, 
and it had added a shoulder, a 
rather pretty shoulder. Next there 
was a body, clothed in the flowing 
orange cape, and finally a woman's 
head. It was the same one — the 
minus woman. 

"It's true," I said. 

The woman seemed to understand. "Yes," she said. "All that 
you told Red Brewer is true, Jay 
Hayling. For you, I am a minus 
woman. For me, you are a minus 
man. But we have bridged the 
gap. For the first time in eternity, 
plus and minus, positive and negative, can meet on even terms." 

"Better not come too close," I 
said. 

"Nothing will happen," she replied. "We are now alike." She 
stooped toward the fallen figure 
on the floor. "Help me with this 
child. He's unconscious." 

"Child!" I said. "If he's a 
child, they grow 'em big in the 
minus world." 

But as I lifted Jay off the floor 



IMAGINATION 



I wondered if he was as big as 
I'd always thought. It wasn't his 
weight. Nothing weighed very 
much on this asteroid, but it was 
his frail body. He seemed to be 
a boy of sixteen, rather than a 
man stationed 300,000,000 miles 
in space. 

I carried him out of the laboratory into the living quarters and 
placed him on his bunk. I loosened his clothing, noting at the time 
that he had been right about his 
garments not fitting him. 

"You've made him lose weight," 
I said. 

"What makes you think so?" 
the woman asked. 

"Because every screwy thing 
that has happened since we came 
here a year ago must have an explanation." 

The woman smiled. "Don't 
think too harshly of me." She 
looked very solid now. Her body 



had lost that tenuous look. She 
was no longer nebulous and cloudlike. "Certain things were necessary in order for me to proceed 
safely through the gap between the 
positive and negative worlds," she 
explained. 

I looked at Red again. His face 
was smooth and I knew he hadn't 
shaved in more than a week. 
"You've made him younger," I 
said. "Well, he shouldn't kick at 
that." 

The woman nodded. "I turned 
the young man inside out. In a 
moment the transition will be complete. You will be our next entrance to this universe ..." 

From Red's bunk came a wail. 
A bawl, like a tiny baby. A dying baby. 

Some people die of age. Red 
died an infant. As for the minus 
woman— she was murdered on an 
asteroid.

THE greatest adventure — building Space Station No. 1 — isn't 
as far from reality as some might 
think, and to get a glimpse into 
the Top Secret files of the Army 
might be an interesting experience. 
Regardless of that however, engineers are already planning the tactics publicly which they will use 
when the order to go to work is 
given. 

Aside from the problems of rockets, fuels and so forth, . the construction of an artificial satellite 
around the Earth is going to involve men in the most unique experience of all — working without 
gravity! That this will pose some 
tricky problems no one doubts — 



but they've already been solved. 

Perhaps the neatest example of 
this is the idea of using a crossbow 
for a rope-thrower! Any building 
work requires cables and ropes, 
even in space and to get them from 
one point to another there is no 
better method than shooting them 
from a crossbow — just like spearing fish on Earth! The engineers 
have planned the blunt-headed arrows, decided on the type of thin 
flexible line, and they know that 
the use of the crossbow is as practical a method as can be suggested. 
Who knows what other ancient techniques will be used besides Bowmen 
of Space! 




DOGFIGHT- 1973 

Flying at 1600 m.p.h. you act with split 
second timing after you sight the enemy. And 
you're allowed only one mistake — your last! 



MY radar picked him up 
when he was about five 
hundred miles to my 
north-northeast and about fortyfive miles above me. I switched 
the velocity calculator on him as 
fast as I could reach it. 

The enemy ship was doing sixteen, possibly even sixteen and a 
half. I took the chance that it 
was most likely an Ivar Interceptor, at that speed, and punched 
out a temporary evasion pattern 
with my right hand while with 
my left I snapped an Ivar K-12 
card into my calculator along with 
his estimated speed, altitude and 
distance. It wasn't much to go 
on as yet but he couldn't have 
much more on me, if as much; 
inwardly I congratulated myself 
on the quick identification I'd 
managed. 

He was near enough now for 



my visor screen to pick him up. 
At least he was alone, that was 
something. My nearest squadron 
mate was a good minute and a 
half away. It might as well have 
been a century. 

Now, this is what is always 
hard to get over to a civilian; the 
time element. Understand, it will 
take me a while to tell this but 
it all took less than sixty seconds 
to happen. 

He had guessed my evasion pattern already — either guessed it or 
had some new calculator that was 
far and beyond anything our 
techs were turning out. I could 
tell he'd anticipated me by the 
Bong-Sonic roll he slipped into. 

I quickly punched up a new 
pattern based on the little material I had in the calculator. At least 
I'd caught the roll. I punched that 
up, hurriedly, slipped it into the 



138 



DOGFIGHT 1973

IBM, guessed that his next probability was a pass, took a chance 
on that and punched it in. 

I was wrong there. He didn't 
take his opportunity for a fronton pass. He was either newly out 
of their academy or insultingly 
confident. My lips felt tight as 
I canceled the frontal pass card, 
punched up two more to take its 
place. 

The base supervisor cut in on 
the phone. "It looks like old Dmitri himself, Jerry, and he's flying 
one of the new K-i 2a models. Go 
get him, boy!" 

I felt like snapping back. He 
knew better than to break in on 
me at a time like this. I opened 
my mouth, then shut it again. Did 
he say K-i2a? Did he- say K-xial 

I squinted at the visor screen. 
The high tail, the canopy, the oddly shaped wing tanks. 

I'd gone off on the identification! 

I slapped another evasion pattern into the controls, a standard 
set, I had no time to punch up 
an improvision. But he was on me 
like a wasp. I rejected it, threw in 
another set. Reject. Another! 

Even as I worked, I kicked the 
release on my own calculator, 
dumped it all, selected like a flash 
an Ivar K-i2a card, and what 
other estimations I could make 
while my mind was busy with the 
full time job of evasion. 



My hands were still making the 
motions, my fingers were flicking 
here, there, my feet touching here, 
there. But my heart wasn't in it. 

He already had such an advantage that it was all I could do to 
keep him in my visor screen. He 
was to the left, to the right. I 
got him for a full quarter-second 
in the wires, but the auto gunner was too far behind, much too " 
far. 

His own guns flicked red. 

I punched half a dozen buttons, 
slapped levers, tried to scoot for 
home. 

To the left of my cubicle two 
lights went yellowish and at the 
same time my visor screen went 
dead. I was blind. 

I sank back in my chair, helpless. 

HpHE speed indicator wavered, 
went slowly, deliberately to 
zero; the altimeter died; the fuel 
gauge. Finally, even the dozen or 
so trouble-indicators here, there, 
everywhere about the craft. Fifteen million dollars worth of warcraft was being shot into wreckage. 

I sat there for a long, long minute and took it. 

Then I got to my feet and 
wearily opened the door of my 
cubicle. Sergeant Walters and the 
rest of the maintenance crew were 
standing there. They could read 



140 



IMAGINATION 



in my face what had happened. 

The sergeant began, "Captain, 
I . 

I grunted at him. "Never mind, 
Sergeant. It had nothing to do 
with the ship's condition." I turned to head for the operations office. 

Bill Dickson strolled over from 
the direction of his own cubicle. 
"Somebody said you just had a 
scramble with old Dmitri himself." 

"I don't know," I said. "I don't 
know if it was him or not. Maybe 
some of you guys can tell a man's 
flying but I can't." 

He grinned at me. "Shot you 
down, eh?" 

I didn't answer. 

He said, "What happened?" 

"I thought it was an Ivar K-12, 
and I put that card in my calcul


ator. Turned out it was one of 
those new models, K-12 a. That 
was enough, of course." 

Bill grinned at me again. 
"That's two this week. That flak 
got you near that bridge and now 
you get . . ." 

"Shut up," I told him. 

He counted up on his fingers 
elaborately. "The way I figure it, 
you lose one more ship and you're 
an enemy ace." 

He was irrepressible. "Damn 
it," I said, "will you cut it out! 
I've got enough to worry about 
without you working me over. 
This means I'll have to spend another half an hour in operations 
going over the fight. And that 
means I'll be late for dinner again. 
And you know Molly." 

Bill sobered. "Gee," he said, 
"I'm sorry. War is hell, isn't it?" 




"Simmer down, fcabe, you're cracking my helmet!" 



THE dream of science has always been to turn energy directly into electricity, without the 
medium of rotating machinery, 
steam plants or water wheels. A 
thermo-couple will do this, so will 
a photocell. But the yield of energy is so small as to be impracticable. 

With the coming of atomic energy the same hope was held. Turn 
atomic energy directly into electricity — and recently this has been 
done — but again on a very feeble 
scale! But at least it is a beginning. 

The atomic battery consists of a 
pair of electrodes immersed in a 




gas, with the whole apparatus located near a source of radioactivity — a piece of material or even 
an atomic pile. The radiations 
from the radioactive source ionize 
the gas, that is, tear electrons from 
it, where they proceed to the electrodes — and presto, you have a battery! 

This atomic battery is feeble — a 
battery the size of a cubic yard will 
only light an electric light bulb. But 
the promise is there and the device is highly useful for instrumentation. The step is slight but 
it is in the right direction. Someday we will operate homes and 
cars from atomic batteries! 




- REVIEWING CURRENT SCIENCE FICTION BOOKS 


Conducted bu l/Ylarlt l^einsbercf 

Hard cover science fiction is booming and many fine novels 
and anthologies are available at all bookstores or by writing 
direct to the publishers. Bach month IMAGINATION will review 
selected books as a guide to your recommended reading list. 



WEST OF THE SUN 



by Edgar Pangborn. Doubleday. 
$2.75. 

First interstellar spaceship, containing Earth men and women, 
lands on the planets of an upspecified star, with the intention of 
setting up a colony. They find two 
primitive humanoid peoples — a 
race of pigmies and giants; they 
learn each other's languages and 
achieve peaceful relations. Even 
though the ship, with most of their 
tools, books and provisions, is lost 
the planet's environment is benevolent, children are born, and the colonists adjust to the situation. 

But in an attempt to unify and 
educate the indigenous stone-age 
population, there is a split among 
the Earthmen. So far, the story 
holds interest. Then follows a long 



and tedious exegesis on jungle 
warfare, relating more to Tarzan's 
Africa than to science-fiction. 
Eventually, a rational community 
of the three races comes about, and 
another colonizing ship arrives. 

The book ends with an appropriate and unusual symposium, somewhat in the style of a Platonic 
dialog, on the building of a Good 
Society. This brings forward some 
of the author's own social views. 
The result is a fine Utopia presentation, and a welcome example of 
how science-fiction can be turned 
into a vehicle for the expression of 
ideas. Elsewhere, the style is not 
always coherent, nor are the characters especially alive, but the 
book is nevertheless a worthwhile 
experience.

THE CURRENTS OF SPACE 



by Isaac Asimov. Doubleday. $2.75 
A spatio-analyst with a new theory that will upset the social and 
economic status quo in one " strategic corner of the galaxy, is shanghaied and administered a psychic 
probe which strips his brain of 
all post-natal impressions. Then 
he's dumped on Fiorina, a slave 
planet, and left to fight his way 
back, to partial mental recovery. 

Meanwhile he becomes the pivot in a power struggle between the 
rulers of Sark (who have Fiorina 
under their domination) and the 
imperialistic expansion of Trantor, 



largest political unit in the galaxy. 

The unfortunate spatio-analyst 
happens to be an Earthman, in a 
future period that no longer recalls that planet as man's starting 
point. He's very credibly portrayed, as is the economy and social 
organization of Fiorina. The Earthman's female companion is a little 
farcical, but all the other characterizations ring true — especially 
some of the minor ones such as 
Markis Genro and Lady Samia. 

Action is fast, and as a whole, 
pretty exciting. This book is in 
the "read-at-one-sitting" class. 



THE CONTINENT MAKERS 



by L. Spraffue de Camp. Twayne. 
$2.95. 

World War III has reduced the 
U. S. to a second-class power, eliminated the U.S.S.R. as a power altogether, and raised Brazil to a 
position of planetary leadership 
in the hundred-year period — 2054 
to 2153 — in which these stories are 
embedded. It's an era of peace 
and far-flung interstellar colonialism, with lurid cultural contact 
between Earthmen and aliens. 

This is a collection of seven short 
yarns and a novelette, all independent of one another, but sharing 
the same historical background: a 
government-owned space transport 
system called "Viagens Interplanetarias," and the legacy of Brazilian space pioneering, which has resulted in Portuguese nameplaces 
strewn throughout planets of neighboring stars. Some of the planets 
have environments and natives 
rather like those of the Amazonian 



jungle. There, Earth's entrepreneurs spend time furthering commerce and, when necessary, eluding 
native vengeance. 

De Camp's style is witty and entertaining as he develops amusing 
science-fiction take-offs on such 
themes as sea piracy, head-hunters, 
the wild west, and jousting knighthood. Spiced with glamorous 
otherworldly women, the stories 
usually feature some benign bounder attempting to exploit the natives, contrary to "Viagens" regulations. 

The title story in the collection 
loses momentum half-way through, 
but the shorts are consistently ingenious. Readers will especially enjoy meeting those interstellar 
swindlers, Darius Koshay and Felix Borel. These are real characters, in the creation of which de 
Camp has obviously taken — as he 
has certainly given — great pleasure. An enjoyable book. 




IT'S about seven in the morning 
when you leave Los Angeles 
and head out through the San 
Fernando Valley, Palmdale, Lancaster — the little desert towns that 
are now becoming aircraft industry centers. The traffic is quite 
heavy until you leave Lancaster 
behind, but from there on it's real 
desert country, with Joshua trees 
gnarled and ancient in the early 
morning sunlight. The little town 
of Mojave lies ahead, but you don't 
go that far. You turn off onto a 
side road, then off that onto a narrow rutted dirt road, more twists 
and turns — and finally you're 
there. 

The Pacific Rocket Society Test 
Area. 

You notice the launching tower 
first. It's red steel, latticed, forty 
feet tall, and if you're feeling adventurous you can climb all the 
way to the top and look down on 



Wari WJf 

the rest of the Test Area. It's quite 
a climb. The Quonset hut and the 
prefabricated house, which together house the members and their 
shop equipment, fall away beneath 
you, and when you're up there on 
top it gives you a start to realize that your average rocket will 
be free of the tower in less than 
a second. About half a second, 
really. 

Squatted down well below you is 
the concrete blockhouse, where the 
firing crew takes shelter when a 
rocket firing is actually under way. 
And outside the barbed wire fence 
of the area proper you might see 
the foxholes dug in the desert sand, 
for spectator use during firings. 
And the long bleached line of the 
air strip, which the Long Beach 
members have just finished clearing and leveling so that they can 
fly in and out of the area. (No, 
not rockets yet; they use old fash

FANDORA'S BOX 



ioned airplanes!) 

There probably won't be any 
firings the morning you're there. 
There's a lot of work going into 
every rocket that finally reaches 
the launching tower. Especially 
when the builders are an amateur 
group — although many of the members are engineers in allied fields 
in their professional life. 

First, once the design is completed, there's the rocket to build. 
If you were part of an Army program, that part of it would be simple. Lots of money, for one thing. 
Time, and equipment, for another. 
But a group like the PRS has to 
work with limited materials and 
limited funds— and the more you 
can improvise, the better. 

For instance, there's the woodburning rocket now under construction by some of the members. At 
first thought a wood-burning vehicle seems a little incongruous — 
more in the Stanley Steamer stage 
(although a Stanley Steamer can 
do a hundred miles an hour.) But 
then you realize that anything 
burns explosively in liquid oxygen. 
Even so, this rocket will never be 
an extremely high performance one 
— but it will be easy to build, relatively inexpensive, and once the 
bugs are ironed out it can be mass 
produced and fired over and over 
during tests of telemetering and 
other equipment. 

It doesn't do just to build a 
rocket' and fire it off and watch 
it climb out of sight and vanish 
into the troposphere. You'll want 
to be able to track it, to find out 
how high it goes, and how fast, and 
where it lands, so you'll be able 
to recover it. If you're lucky, and 



if your parachute recovery system 
works, you'll be able to recover it 
more or less intact. And above all 
you'll want to know how it performed — if it lived up to its theoretical expectations, and if not, 
why not. Then, when you build 
your next rocket, you can correct 
for the bugs. 

Of course, the- rockets here at the 
PRS firing range won't climb as 
high as the V-2's and similar 
types. They're smaller, for one 
thing. And far less expensive. 
But they'll travel about as fast as 
a V-2, over a shorter flight period. 

If you've ever watched movies of 
a V-2 firing you've probably noticed how slowly it rises from the 
ground, the way it seems to balance 
on its exhaust stream for a moment before deliberately and with 
increasing acceleration climbs to 
the top of the tower. Its initial acceleration isn't much over 1 G (and 
of course at 1 G it would remain 
at. rest.) 

A PRS rocket won't take off like 
that. It develops its velocity fast, 
and will be traveling at about 5 
G's acceleration by the time it is 
free of the tower. Because in a 
small relatively inexpensive rocket you can't have gyro stability, 
and you'll need speed and the resulting air drag to hold your 
course up through the atmosphere. 
(There's a big disadvantage, of 
course. The rocket expends much 
of its. precious fuel fighting the 
air drag, and by the time it is up 
where the air is thin it's near cutoff, with its fuel about exhausted.) 

AMATEUR rocket enthusiasts 
don't have illusions about their 



146 



IMAGINATION 



work. The first moon-rocket, for 
instance, obviously won't come 
from the PRS firing grounds. The 
days of inventors with ideas who 
whip up world shaking gadgets 
out in the back yard are doubtless 
well in the past. Building rockets 
now is even very unlike building 
them back in the thirties. They're 
accepted. They're no longer the 
visionary things they were when 
Willy Ley and the other pioneers 
of the German Rocket Society 
were struggling with the basic 
problems of fuel and mass ratio 
and combustion chambers — and the 
equally basic problem of finding an 
area in Germany where they could 
fire their "toys." 

Now we have White Sands and 
Point Mugu and many another 
center, their government sponsored 
programs working far in advance 
of anything amateur groups can do 
in the way of altitude flights, of 
increasing size, or of expensive 
precision equipment. 

And the main obstacle to space 
stations, and ultimately to space 
flight, right now is money. 

But there's a lot that amateurs 
can do — both as a hobby and as a 
means of learning more about rocketry and acquiring the skills that 
will undoubtedly become reduced 
to assembly line mechanicalness in 
the coming age of space flight. 

A club like the PRS has room 
for every type of rocket enthusiast. There are boys in their teens, 
designing their first rockets, maybe 
going over a lot of ground that has 
been previously covered, but adding 
their own touches, and working 
ultimately into a far broader grasp 
of astronautics than was possible 
to any but the most advanced theo


rists of yesterday. There are people working with small, relatively 
simple rockets in order to test and 
improve other equipment — electronic tracking systems for use in recording flight data, methods for 
opening and closing fuel valves 
during flight, variations in configuration or in fuel mixture, etc . . . 

Then there are the people working on the major rocket projects 
such as the current SRV, or Standard Research Vehicle. Here you 
are really working to close tolerances. And most of the parts have 
to be homemade. The designing, itself, has already taken a long 
time. The SRV is an unusual rocket in that it's solid-liquid fueled 
— thiakol rubber and liquid oxygen 
— in contrast to most rockets, which 
utilize the combustion of either 
two liquids or a mixed solid. The 
fuel and combustion chamber presented new problems . . . 

The SRV will have a booster, a 
short duration, high-thrust rocket 
from which the main rocket is fired. 
The booster will fire for about 
nine seconds, and then fall back 
to Earth as the SRV takes over, its 
velocity added to that already obtained from the booster, with the 
weight and drag of the empty 
booster left behind. 

This type of rocket is comparatively efficient. In fact, proposals 
for Earth satellite stations usually 
call for a multi-stage rocket, only 
the last stage of which ever reaches orbital velocity. But a rocket of 
this sort is also complicated to 
build and to synchronize so that 
its ignition system will fire the 
second stage at the proper time 
and cut the first stage free. 

So before the SRV is ever fired 



FANDORA'S BOX 



147 



there will be many tests. There 
will be static tests of the booster — 
tests in which the booster is held 
down when fired and its thrust 
and pressures calculated. There 
will be static tests of the main 
SRV. And there will probably be 
flight tests of the booster with a 
mock SRV — -a wooden mock-up of 
the same weight and shape as the 
final rocket. 

You don't want to wait until 
the actual firing to find out what's 
wrong. 

The firing time itself will be 
very short. The rocket will be in 
the launching tower, and the firing 
crew in the blockhouse, off to one 
side. The rocket will be counted 
down — three, two, one, and then 
someone will throw a switch. The 
rocket will be out of the tower in 
half a second; the booster will cut 
off after nine seconds and fall 
back to Earth, its parachute the 
only visible sign that a firing 
took place, for the SRV will be 
well out of sight, still firing, still 
climbing. 

In about forty seconds its fuel 
will be gone. It will still climb, 
coasting upward, slowed now by 
gravity, already reaching the area 
of thinner air and reduced drag. 
If you're lucky, and if the visual 
tracking system — the theodolites — 
function well, you may see it climb 
to the top of its trajectory. You 
probably won't. Probably its 
presence will be recorded only as 
blips on the electronic tracking devices. It will climb, slowing now, 
reach the top of its trajectory 
and fall over to coast back toward 
Earth. As it falls into the heavier layers of the atmosphere nearer 
the ground a switch will throw 



and the parachute open. You probably won't see that either. Again 
it will be the electronic trackers 
that will tell you where it is landing. 

It will be a bent, spent thing in 
the desert sand when you recover 
it. 

Months of work have gone toward those few minutes, and now 
they're over. Now there is more 
data to icorrelate, more factors to 
take into consideration for the 
next model, and if the test was successful there's a sense of shared 
creation. And the memory of the 
rocket in its swift climb away from 
the tower. 

And the feeling of tomorrow, 
when space ships to the planets 
will be commonplace, and amateur 
groups like the PRS will, perhaps, 
be looking to the stars . . . 

Now to the fan magazine reviews 
for this month. 

* * * 

PACIFIC ROCKET SOCIETY 
BULLETIN: 25c; monthly; Freddie Curtis, 428 S. Verdugo Rd., 
Glendale 5, Calif. The official publication of the PRS, the Bulletin 
details the technical work in progress on club-sponsored rockets, 
gives information on club meetings, 
field trips, and guest speakers, and 
also runs articles on astronautics 
of interest to serious rocket enthusiasts. 

Unless your interest in rocketry is comparatively technical you 
probably wouldn't care for the Bulletin, but if you're really interested you might like to write in for 
information about becoming a corresponding member of the Society.

Now before I go on to other

IMAGINATION 



fanzines, there's the important matter of the 1953 Convention. 

Over the Labor Day weekend the 
Eleventh World Science Fiction 
Convention will take place. You 
may have noticed in various fanzines and in fanzine reviews how 
many references are made to the last 
Convention at Chicago. Just about 
everyone who came and listened 
and talked and met other fans, just 
about everyone went home thinking, 
"and it's fifty-two whole weeks to 
Philadelphia ..." 

Well, it's not so long now. And 
if you haven't sent in your dollar 
for membership in the Convention Committee to Box 2019, Philadelphia 3, Penna., you had better 
do it right away. You'll get the 
Progress Reports on the Convention, what's going to happen on 
the program, hotel accommodations 
and rates. (The Convention hotel, 
the Bellevue - Stratford, is really 
going to do everything possible for 
the fans.) 

In short, it's going to be a 

wonderful sociable Convention, one 

you'd really be sorry to miss. Try 

to make it if you possibly can-. . . 
* * * 

OOPSLA!; 15c; monthly; Gregg 
Calkins, 1429 Talisman Drive, 
Salt Lake City 16, Utah. As his 
first year of publishing Oopsla 
comes to a close, Gregg celebrates 
with the Oopslannish!, or anniversary issue. It is just like the regular publication, only more so, both 
in number of pages and in lighthearted fun. 

Shelby Vick's feature, "Dear 
Alice," takes Alice on a train where 
she is looking for Chicago and the 
last Convention, and there's a paragraph of punning that's really 



something. It starts with Alice's 
train of thoughts that lead her to 
question the conductor — who is 
made of copper and shockingly uninformed — and continues with her 
wondering ohm, not knowing watt 
to do . . . 

That's only a sample. 

As for a story written as an exchange of letters, Bob Tucker's 
"The Iron Curtain Drops" is really tops. About Joe Fann in the 
U.S.A. who writes to Handel C. 
Hanker, Minister of Mimeographs 
in Prague, about his difficulties in 
obtaining Imovar Slobarish's fanzine . . . 

It ends with the best punch-paragraph of the fan year. 

The cover too — Bob Fultz's portrait of Mars, with, mounted frustratingly at the pole, the sign, "No 
Parking. R. Bradbury." 

DESTINY: 25c; quarterly; Earl 
Kemp, 3477 North Clark St., Chicago 13, 111., or Malcolm Willits, 
11848 S.E., Powell Blvd., Portland 
66, Oregon. 

With its No. 7 issue Destiny goes 
into a new format — one of the very 
best looking layouts in the entire 
field. The art work, both Somme's 
cover and the interiors, are exceptionally well done and well reproduced, and I especially liked the 
simple, unrelieved geometrical design that preceded the story "Ornod." 

The fiction is good, perhaps the 
best short being Pat Eaton's "Racial Prejudice." It's an old theme 
but well written, and very well 
characterized. Among the articles 
there are two short answers to the 
question "Why Conquer Space?"— 
answers given by men who certain


FANDORA'S BOX 



149 



ly should know. Willy Ley and 
Arthur C. Clarke. And Don Day 
tells of preparing his monumental 
Index to Science Fiction. 

I'm sure that Destiny will continue to live up to its endeavor 
to present only the best fan fiction, 
articles, artwork and poetry available. I'm also sure that if you 
like fan writing at all you'll consider a quarter spent on this zine 
a quarter well spent. It costs more 
than that to publish your copy — 
but the more people who buy and 
subscribe, the lower the cost per 
issue. 

So why not send in for your copy? 

* * * 

FANTASY-TIMES: 10c; twice a 
month; James V. Taurasi, 137-03 
32nd. Ave., Flushing 54, N.Y. Here 
in this news-sheet of the stf world, 
now in its twelfth year of publication, you'll be able to find all the 
news about fantasy people and 
publications. 

The style of Fantasy-Times has 
changed with the years. The controversial, feud-type articles are 
gone. The copy is tightened. And 
the news value has risen until F-T 
has become synonymous with everything worth finding out in the 
science fiction world. 

Certainly worth your dime if 

you're at all news minded. 

* * * 

SCIENCE - FICTION ADVERTISER: 20c; 1745 Kenneth Rd., Glendale 1, Calif. Published bi-monthly. 
Most amateur magazines that aspire to real quality of format quickly run up against the problem of 
costs. Many publish at a loss issue after issue — their editors willing to put so much time, effort 
and money into a publication of 



which they can be truly proud. 
But often the pressures eventually 
become too heavy and the magazine folds . . . 

The Advertiser is a quality publication. With its Morris Scott 
Dollens covers and its thoughtful, 
thought-provoking articles (such 
as Henry Kuttner's exploration of 
"Science in Fiction" in the issue 
I have here) it easily maintains its 
position as one of the best amateur productions in the field. But 
— it's primarily an advertising medium. Its ads support it. It can 
thus continue, month after month, 
year after year. 

If you're a serious collector of 
science fiction you doubtless already subscribe to the Advertiser. 
If you're not a collector, but a serious reader, interested in the background as well as the fiction of 
stf, then you too should read the 
Advertiser. You'll like it. 
* * * 

VEGA: 10c; monthly; Joel Nydahl; 
119 S. Front St., Marquette, Mich. 
Here's a fanzine that gets bigger 
and better with each issue. It 
started out as a rather thin, hectographed zine — but with some fine 
writing and Joel's special flair as 
a fanzine editor. Now it's mimeoed, over twenty pages long, with 
Joel seriously wondering if he 
shouldn't charge a little more and 
increase the contents. 

I hope he does. Vega's easily 
worth more than a dime now, and 
I for one would like to see more 
of it. (Though a big fanzine with 
a growing circulation can be awfully hard to handle month after 
month; it can end up running the 
editor, instead of vice versa.) 

A regular feature in Vega — and 



IMAGINATION 



one of the top fan features too — 
is Marion Bradley's "What Every 
Young Fan Should Know." In the 
current issue she has some advice 
for new fans contemplating joining 
a fan club. 

One thing about Vega — it keeps 
getting better all the time. You 
can't go wrong if you send for a 
copy. 

* * * 

SPACESHIP: 10c; quarterly; Bob 
Silverberg, 760 Montgomery St., 
Brooklyn 13, N.Y. From the vantage point of its fourth year in 
the fanzine field Spaceship looks 
over 1952, its prozines and its fans. 
It's a good review of the big boom 
in science fiction . . . 

Among the other articles of this 
primarily non-fiction zine there's 
the incomparable Robert Bloch, 
with "Who Played the Harp"— 
about Walt Willis, Irish fan. 

And Roger Dard reports from 
Australia. There's an interesting 
publishing field down there, from 
the sound of his review. A truly 

international flavor, this issue. 

* * * 

FANTASTIC WORLDS: 25c; Edward W. Ludwig, 1942 Telegraph 
Ave., Stockton, Calif. Here's the 
"little" magazine of the science 
fiction world — the magazine that 
publishes the off-trail stories of 
writers like Kris Neville and Wilson 
(Bob) Tucker. The magazine that 
maintains a really literary quality 
in its articles without being the 
least bit high-hat, and should certainly appeal to anyone who likes 
good artwork, good fiction, and 
good features of an imaginative, 
out of the ordinary style. 

Also, Fantastic Worlds gives 
background material on science 



fiction's big names, past and present. There was the article on August Derleth and Arkham House, 
and Sam Sackett's write-up of the 
Ackerman story. 

An excellent magazine, one you 
will be proud to show off if your 
friends want to know what fan 
publishing can accomplish. 

PENDULUM:* 15c; quarterly; Bill 
Venable, 610 Park Place, Pittsburgh 9, Pa. Editors Bill Venable 
and Donald Susan here present a 
good non-fiction fanzine with articles of special interest to those 
who like serious features on stf 
subjects. 

The issue I have here, for example, has a well-thought-out bit of 
information by Joe Gibson. Entitled "The Ridge," it's about the 
three-dimensional star constellations of space (not the two-dimensional ones that appear grouped 
together as seen from earth.) The 
Ridge is the constellation of which 
Sol is a member — and the old theme 
of getting lost in space fades into 
impossibility if you have an easily 
identifiable star cluster to home in 
on. 

That's just one example of what 
you'll find in Pendulum. 

* * * 

SCIENCE FICTION BULLETIN: 
15c; monthly; Harlan Ellison, 
12701 Shaker Blvd., Apt. 616, 
Cleveland 20, Ohio. Here's a wellbalanced fanzine where you'll find 
stories, columns, articles, and a 
fine book review section. 

I've always liked Raymond L. 
Clancy's humorous fantasies — and 
his "The Bar on Boulevard Jones" 
that I've just finished reading is 
one of his best. It's truly fantasy, 



FANDORA'S BOX 



casually told, logically developed 
within the framework of its illogical setting — the bar where you rub 
shoulders with dragons and pterodactyls, and the werewolves get 
thrown out when they begin to 
turn. 

The Bulletin's a well-varied, mimeod fanzine that makes a policy of 
rejecting inferior work and passing on the good material to you, 
the reader. 

* * * 

PAN-FARE: 15c; bimonthly; W. 
Paul Ganley, 119 Ward Road, North 
Tonawanda, N.Y. The all-fiction 
fanzine still consistently runs some 
of the best off-trail fantasy fiction 
you 11. find. (Witness Andrew Duane's story last summer, "Dread 
Huntress." That one deserves anthologizing somewhere.) 

As Editor Ganley himself says, 
Pan-Fare has changed in its more 
than three years of publication. 
Many of the same writers still 
write for it — Duane, Tom Covington, and Terry Carr — but they're 
writing better. Much better. The 
neophyte fan writer isn't in FanFare. To get published here you've 
got to be good. 

So if you send for a copy you can 
know you'll find well-written stories by young writers, some of 
whose names will probably be in 
the professional magazines any 
time now. 

* * * 

BREVZINE: 10c; monthly; Warren A. Freiberg, 5018 W. 18th. St., 
Cicero 50, 111. This erstwhile miniature sized fanzine is now going 
into a large format. In a way I'll 
be sorry to see it change — it was 
always so distinctive, and there 
was always so much reading matter 



packed into its small pages. 

But Editor Freiberg promises 
that there will be even more packed into the new large format. And 
the price for everything — fiction, 
Hank Moskowitz's column on "Spatial Relations" and all the rest — 
will still be only a dime. 

* * * 

THE SPACEWARPER: 25c; 
quarterly; Charles A. Nuetzel, 
16452 Moorpark St., Encino, Calif. 
The issue I have here is the second one put out by this group of 
young San Fernando Valley fans. 
Certainly the most striking thing 
about it is its cover — done multicolored by the silk-screen process, 
something you find very rarely. 
A most effective job, too. 

The fanzine itself is mimeoed 
and contains some short, rather 
light fiction, book reviews, and articles. Best of all, there's E. Everett Evan's account of how he produced and sold his first novel. It's 
called "Report on Man of Many 
Minds." 

And for all you Burroughs fans, 
the next issue of Spacewarper is 

an all ERB issue. 

* * * 

THE FEMZINE: 15c; quarterly; Marian Cox, 79th. A.B. Sqdn., 
Sioux City, Iowa. This is the allgirl fanzine. (Men can read it, but 
they can't write for it, nor belong 
to the sponsoring club, the Fanettes.) 

As Marian says, "The club was 
established to learn if women can 
accomplish anything without the 
aid of male fans." Well, the girls 
of the Panettes seem to think so. 
They're having a fine time, and 
they're putting out a fanzine that 
really has that feminine touch. 



IMAGINATION 



How about it girls? Care to join 
up? If you do, just get in touch 
with Marian . . . 

* * * 

KAYMAR- TRADER: 10c; K. 
Martin Carlson, 1028 3rd. Ave. So., 
Moorhead, Minn. This is the trading zine formerly known as STF 
Trader, and here, as before, you 
can buy advertising space very 
reasonably either to offer fantasy 
material for sale or to run a 
"Wanted" notice for books or magazines. 

Also, if you're a collector, you 
can probably find some items you'll 
want already listed. The Trader's 
the place for buying, selling, or 
swapping your science fiction material. 

* * * 

SOL: 10c; bimonthly; Dave Ish, 
914 Hammond Rd., Ridgewood, 
N. J. In the issue I have here Marion Bradley has a rather provocative article called "The Good in 
Fan Publishing." It's a rebuttal 
of sorts of Editor Ish's earlier 
article about the evils of fan publishing, which he wrote (he says) 
to try to discourage young fans 



from taking up fanzine editing. 

Here Marion lists among the 
benefits to be gained from publishing, "the familiarity one gains 
with one's own language." I agree, 
until she goes on to say, "You'd 
be surprised to discover how few 
persons really use their training 
in English after they leave high 
school." Marion, how many use it 
while they're in high school? 

Some people I know don't even 
dig Pogo . . . 

* * * 

Well, that's about all there's 
room for this time, so I'd better 
close up the Box until next month. 
I'm trying to review all the fanzines — if not this time, then the 
next issue — but sometimes it becomes rather difficult, especially 
if there are forty-plus in the Box 
at one time . . . 

Yes, the science fiction boom has 
hit fandom too . . . 

Keep sending them, all of you. 
I'll get to them. Just send them 
to me, Mari Wolf, Pandora's Box, 
IMAGINATION, P.O. Box 230, 
Evanston, 111. 

See you next month.

A great new science fiction, novel by the talented author of ARMAGEDDON. 
1970. BEWARE THE USURPERS! and other widely acclaimed stories. This 
is a novel of the far future and man's desperate attempt to gain the

WOW!— NO WORDS FOR IT . . . 

Dear Mr. Hamling: 

Allow me to extend my congratulations for putting out one of the 
best stf magazines on the market. 
I can't say it is the best because 
I rate my approval on the quality 
of over-all issues — but I can say 
that in the time I've been reading 
Madge it has rated very high with 
me. 

In the February issue EARTH 
ALERT by Kris Neville was a 
great story; but coming more up 
to date, in the May issue which I 
have just finished reading, THE 
FIST OF SHIVA was— Wow!— 
there are no words for it! I finished the story in one sitting. 

All of the stories in the issue 
were good except for EARTH CAN 
BE FUN by John W. Jakes. This 
left me disappointed since there 
was too little science fiction in it. 

For an over-all stf magazine, 
Madge has it over all competitors; 
I enjoy the editorials, features, and 
the little articles following stories. 

In closing, if THE FIST OF 



SHIVA is a sample of Dan Galouye's work, get more by him! 

Alan Miller 
590 Moody St. 
Waltham 54, Mass. 
Thanks for the kind words, Alan; 
rest assured we'll try and make 
Madge an even better magazine in 
coming issues . . . As to Dan Galouye, he's got many fine stories 
coming up soon wlh 

CHANGING OUR NAME? 

Dear Bill Hamling: 

THE FIST OF SHIVA in the 
May issue of Madge was one novel 
I couldn't stop reading from the 
moment I started it. I don't know 
if it is an original idea, but it's 
the first novel of its type, I've ever 
read. Why not have Daniel F. Galouye write a sequel? (If Dan" can 
keep writing stories of this caliber you've got a regular reader 
from here on!) 

A real surprise was finding pictures of the Chicago Science Fiction Convention on the 2nd cover. 
Why not publish more photos of

LETTERS FROM THE READERS 



the Chicon? Everybody who reads 
science fiction should be interested 
in seeing them. Also, keep using 
cartoons in every issue — they add 
variety to the magazine. 

I see in your letter column that 
you're thinking of changing the 
name of the magazine from IMAGINATION to MADGE. Here's a 
vote against it. Don't change the 
magazine's fine distinctive title 
one bit. 

The story DOOM SATELLITE 
struck me as rather old-fashioned. 
I've read about seven stories in the 
past year with the same idea. Let's 
keep Madge's yarns on the original 
side . . . Keep up the good work 
— hard too — of editing a fine stf 
magazine. 

John Truax 
1102 9th St. 
Rapid City, S. Dak. 
The Chicon is pretty much ancient 
history by now, John — but we'll 
publish pictures of the forthcoming Convention in Philadelphia. 
Which reminds us, now's the time 
to make reservations with the committee to attend that gala event. 
You'll find particulars below. . The 
important thing to remember is— 
be there! . . . Change our name? 
Not, likely! The item you refer to 
was simply a jesting remark by 
inference. Why should we change 



the best title in the field? . . wlh 
JUICY COMMENTS, TO WHIT: 

Dear Bill: 

I wish I could comment on THE 
FIST OF SHIVA in the May issue, 
but I have not had time to read it 
as yet. I'll let you know later. At 
the moment I do have some gripes 
against Madge & Company, so my 
juicy comments, to whit: 

The cover painting on the May 
issue, by H. W. McCauley, was 
ballyhooed by you as being the 
best cover that Madge has yet 
sported. That was the general 
thought you tried to put over, I 
think. — I think it's the worst cover 
Madge has ever had! And as for 
McCauley, a usually fine artist, 
I'm frankly disappointed with him. 
Some stinkweed should also go to 
Malcolm Smith, since he's Art Director; he should have known better. 

Speaking of covers, the best so 
far this year was Terry's for the 
February issue. McCauley's January cover was good but had a bit 
too much white around it. Terry's 
April cover was a bit better than 
his October one of last year. My 
all-time favorite is Smith's December cover for last year — which 
reposes over our television set!

IMAGINATION 



My other gripe concerns Kris 
Neville. Kris had his first published story in Madge's first issue 
— or should I say "first story" 9 
He did a novel around a flying 
saucer cover by Terry for January 
1952; he did another novel around 
another flying saucer cover by Terry for the February 1953 number. 
It has now come to my attention 
that he is doing another novel for 
Madge, again based on a flying 
saucer cover. (By Terry, no doubt!) 

If anything, this shows a bad 
slip in editorial judgment. I liked 
both of Neville's saucer stories. But 
how many times can an author repeat when he's so limited? 

I feel sorry for three people: Kris 
Neville, who, I think, is getting 
a raw deal; William L. Hamling, 
who, it appears, still has a long 
way to go before he becomes a 
really competent editor; and Madge 
herself, who will lose face accordingly. To stay monthly*she must 
maintain a high quality of material, 
much higher than her present average. 

The above words have probably 
condemned me in your eyes; if so, 
I'm truly sorry. I like Madge and 
a chap called wlh. 

I've tried to say what I think 
may be helpful criticism. I think 
Madge is good — but I think she ean 
be better too! 

Henry Moskowitz 
Three Bridges, N. J. 
An interesting letter, Hank, and 
while you're entitled to your opinions, as everyone is, there are a 
few facts that need clarification. 
First, the McCauley cover on the 
May issue. You didn't like it, so 
no question there. But we never 
stated ivc thought it was to be 



Madge's best cover so far — we said 
— and we think it's true, that it's 
the most striking cover Madge has 
featured. Frankly, we don't think 
it's the best — never did — but we 
feel it's a real eye-catcher, the 
type you'll have to look at more 
than casually — a striking cover. 
And don't pass the stinkiveed to 
Malcolm Smith; we .personally selected the cover so we'll take the 
bricks — and bouquets. Fair enough? 
. . . Now to Kris Neville. Yes, Kris 
is completing a new cover novel for 
Madge; but it is not for a "flying 
saucer" cover as you intimate. It 
is by Terry — and a fine job if we 
do say so, so look forward to it. 
Thus, your following comments re 
bad editorial judgment are not 
quite accurate; the novel has no 
"saucers" in it — but it is a terrific 
story. (Kris has sent us the first 
half already, and we think it's one 
of his best jobs.) Kris has one of 
the best styles — and talented imaginations of any writer in the field. 
His stories appear in all the leading stf magazines and nobody could 
call him a "typed" writer. (No 
pun intended!) A Neville story is 
something to watch for — so keep 
your eye on coming issues . . wlh 

NOTHING BUT THE BEST! 

Dear Mr. Hamling: 

Thought I would drop a line or 
two to a swell science fiction magazine — Madge! 

I have followed stf since the 
days of Hugo Gernsback — 1926; 
also, your career too, which to say 
the least has been quite phenomenal. 
Madge is. a bit of all right. 

For some reason or other I've 
never bothered to drop a line to 



LETTERS FROM THE READERS 



iS7 



any editor of science fiction in 
more than 25 years; but IMAGINATION has been so consistently 
good I had to break a long silence. 

The May issue being at hand, I'll 
give you my comments. 
COVER: Good eye-appeal — I know 
I'd hate to meet that face on a dark 
night ! 

STORIES: A short, EARTH CAN 
BE FUN by John W. Jakes takes 
first place with me. This was so 
refreshingly down-to-earth and simple; I never get tired of boy-andgirl themes with a good stf setting. THE FIST OF SHIVA was 
not a bad yarn at all. I purchase 
each and every stf magazine every 
month, and Madge is the only publication I read from cover to cover. 
The rest of them I'm lucky to get 
one or two good stories out of each 
issue. 

CARTOONS: The best I've seen 
in any stf magazine in a long time. 

Yes, Madge is my favorite because it's the best, and all I have 
to add is — keep it that way! 

Al Comfort 
2264 Chestnut Ave. 
Long Beach, Cal. 
A pleasure hearing from you, Al 
— but for goodness sake don't let 
another 25 years go by before you 
write another letter! The best? 
We'll certainly try and keep it that 
way wlh 

OUTSTANDING NOVEL 

Dear Bill: 

I've started to write you after 
every issue since ARMAGEDDON, 
1970 in the October 1952 issue, but 
somehow I just never got around to 
it. 

In the May issue of Madge THE 



FIST OF SHIVA far surpasses any 
lead novel in the last year. Its 
closest rival being EARTH 
ALERT! by Kris Neville, February issue. As to shorts, keep Locke, 
Knight, Dick, and Nydahl. From 
the example he gave (Nydahl) in 
the May issue, LESSON FOR TODAY, I believe he can become a 
writer of Dan Galouye's stature. 

Glad to know that Madge is 
now a monthly magazine. For one 
thing that means more fanzine reviews in FANDORA'S BOX. The 
fanzine angle is something new to 
me. I received my first one in 
the mail the other day, and since 
then have been shouting my praise 
for the whole movement. 

Now for a few requests. Put a 
little more life in the reader column. — I don't care what this guy 
Carey likes or doesn't like — because he seems to be one of those 
people nothing will please. You 
should not waste space on adverse 
letters like his. What I meant 
by "life in the reader column" was 
that you have no drawing card. 
Someone, that is, who'll put a little 
fun or brain food in the letters. 

I'd like a personal department 
and a better coming attraction setup. You can ditch those science 
briefs, but not FANTASY FILM 
FLASHES. Easy on the cartoons. 
Madge is a science fiction magazine not an abbreviated version of 
1000 Jokes! — But don't get me 
wrong. I'm not trying to complain — just feel that a few changes 
are in order. 

I'd like to compliment one of 
your artists, Bill Terry. His work 
is some of the best I've seen. And, 
your May editorial was quite the 
thing. That Russian should try

We don't plan the reader section, 
Burt; we feel that every letter is 
a "draw card" in itself. No single 
reader gets preference in having 
his letter published, and as to adverse comments, past experience 
shows you we're not using many 
such letters — there just aren't many 
to use! Hold down on the number 
of cartoons per issue? How about 
that, gang? So far they've been a 
big hit. And while we're on the 
subject of new features, do you 
like our new book review column?

SUBSCRIBER FOR LIFE . . . 

Dear Mr. Hamling: 

The May issue of Madge received, 
but I've only had time to read two 
stories thus far. All that can be 
said is that what has entered this 
thick skull of mine has met only 
approving brain cells. 

LESSON FOR TODAY, the first 
story I read, was a complete and 
delightful surprise. EARTH CAN 
BE FUN, the other story I had 
time for, was easily the better of 
the two, because it is such a fresh 
idea. If the author's name had 
been omitted I'd have asked if 
Robert A. Heinlein had written it! 

What really made me want to 
write before finishing the issue was 
your editorial. All I can say about 
that is if you continue to be so 
outspoken (and in the right at the 
same time) you have a subscriber 
for life.

Glad you liked the editorial, Jim. 
No doubt Madge is in the process 
of being blacklisted by the Kremlin 
right now — which to our way of 
thinking is something to cheer 
about . . . Robert A. Heinlein 
story? — Would you like to have us 
get a new Heinlein story for 
Madge? . . . Come on, coax us!

A TOP ISSUE 

Dear Bill Hamling : 

I just got the May issue of IMAGINATION today. I sat right 
down and started reading it — and 
didn't stop until I finished the entire issue. 

THE FIST OF SHIVA was excellent. Dan Galouye has such a 
good record it's a wonder that he 
hasn't seen hard covers yet. 

MILK RUN, very good — darned 
good ! But not quite up to the 
standard set by DEEPFREEZE in 
the January issue. 

EARTH CAN BE FUN, fair. I 
guess I wasn't very interested in 
it. 

DOOM SATELLITE, very good. 
A real hair-raiser! 

LESSON FOR TODAY, excellent! This is the kind of story 
that makes you think . . . 

The letter section was very interesting this issue. I'm glad that 
Madge is going monthly — for the 
second time! 

When are you going to publish 
the new Dwight V. Swain story 
you've talked about? And when is 
Geoff St. Reynard going to write 
a sequel to TOMORROW THE 
WORLD! . . . ? 



LETTERS FROM THE READERS 



159 



All in all, the May issue is one 
of the best Madge has ever published. 

John Walston 
Vashon, Wash. 
The "going monthly twice" business is due to a postal regulation. 
Madge ^started off as a bi-monthly 
and was so listed; then we went 
six-weekly, but were listed as 
monthly except for March, July and 
November ; now Madge is published every four weeks so the monthly 
listing is finally accurate . . . 
Dwight V. Swain will appear 
shortly, and Geoff St. Reynard has 
a great new novel coming up next 
month, THE BUTTONED SKY. 
Don't miss it! wlh 

AGE IS NO BARRIER . . . 

Dear Bill: 

In the letter section for the May 
issue of Madge you show that you 
are one of those kind editors who 
realize teen-agers have intelligence! 
Hope you can convince some of 
the stodgy Victorians who call themselves critics! Intelligent critics — 
as insult to injury. 

I've been reading science fiction 
for four years — since I was ten, 
and I not only enjoy what I read, 
but I thoroughly understand it.' I 
wonder if some of the "adult" 
critics can say the same? 

I'm glad Madge doesn't run serials. I always get mad when I see 
up to a hundred pages wasted when 
they could have been filled with a 
complete story ! 

In the May issue, Dan Galouye's 
THE FIST OF SHIVA was good. 
It also made sense — Which makes 
the yarn nearly perfect. 

How about more TOFFEE? And 



those cartoons are new, different, 
and nifty. Keep them by all means. 
In closing, I'd like to correspond 
with other stf fans. 

Virginia Poore 
6519 S. Emerald Ave. 
Chicago 21, 111. 
As we've gone on record saying 
many times in the past, age is no 
barrier to enjoying and understanding science fiction. In our 
opinion the mere fact that a person reads science fiction puts him 
in a higher intelligence bracket! 
TOFFEE? You'll be seeing the 
impish lass again soon, we'll bet.

McCAULEY'S NIGHTMARE . . . 

Dear Bill: 

Please send me right away one 
member of the SPITUF (Society 
for the Prevention of Inhuman 
Treatment to Unsuspecting Fen) 
so someone can read to me the May 
issue of Madge. I understand that 
THE FIST OF SHIVA is great, 
wonderful, superlative, and so 
forth — but I wouldn't know for 
sure. I've been blinded by that 
GHASTLY ewer, which my unsuspecting eyes automatically riveted 
upon first thing. It's a sad world.

IMAGINATION 



What a fate for such a loyal reader of Madge who has read (and 
carefully saved) every issue to 
date, that her eyes should behold 
that nemesis of sanity, McCauley's 
Nightmare . . . 

Ah, yes! I hear that all the 
stories in the May issue (except 
for MILK RUN) were way up 
there in readable enjoyment. 
That Madge is galloping to the top 
of the popularity list is a well 
known fact. 

But honestly, did anyone actually 
write in this time and say they 
liked the grimacing ghoul plastered all over the cover? Well? 

Aside from the above gripe, 
Madge is doing fine . . . 

Quite a thought-provoking editorial this time, although by now 
Stalin is beyond hating anyone . . . 

Now for a favor: I know there 
must be .many femme fen in this 
state, so will they please come out 
of hiding and make themselves 
known? Come on, you gals — write 
to me! 

Carol McKinney

Sure we got a letter liking the 
May cover — artist McCauley writes 
us every issue! So it really blinded you, huh? Guess it was a striking cover after all! .... wlh 

IT STARED BACK AT HIM! 

Dear Bill: 

As I write this letter I am staring intently at the cover of the 
May issue. Impassively, the face 
of that — that thing — stares back 
at me! 

The truth is, after your buildup 
about this particular cover I re


ceived quite a let-down when I first 
saw it. And to think you described it as the "most striking" 
cover Madge has ever had! Doubtless there are many readers who 
will agree with you, but my opinion is that it looks like a splash 
of bright colors against a background of blue paper . . . 

However, I was not disappointed 
by Daniel F. Galouye's cover novel, 
THE FIST OF SHIVA. It certainly lived up to expectations. 
Maybe because I like all stories 
about telepaths. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed it. No doubt you 
will be presenting more of Galouye's 
splendid work in the future. 

The rest of the stories were also 
very readable. The only one that 
made a negative impression on me 
was THE BIG CHEESE. 

All in all, Bill, at the risk of 
sounding like Madge's average contented reader, the magazine is 
holding its own in the race for supremacy in the science fiction 
world. 

I wonder if members of the Canadian Science Fiction Association 
would contact me . . . 

Say, about that cover again. 
Maybe it grows on you. I'll have to 
wet it and see . . . 

Daryl Sharp

Lots more of Dan Galouye coming 
up, Daryl. The cover? The guy 
depicted there should be a baseball pitcher. He's sure thrown a 
lot of strikes! wlh 

GOOD MAILING SERVICE 

Dear Mr. Hamling: 



LETTERS FROM THE READERS 



161 



The May .issue of Madge is the 
best yet with a 100% score. 

All the stories were good, especially the novel, THE FIST OF 
SHIVA. It is Dan Galouye's best 
story so far — and quite a record. 

In THE BIG CHEESE the 
popular "rat" idea was handled 
very well indeed. 

I'd like to compliment your 
subscription service; those heavy 



envelopes you send Madge in 
get my copies to me in perfect 
shape. 
Keep up the cartoons!

What Strange Powers 
Did The Ancients Possess? 




IIJVERY important discovery relating 
to mind power, sound thinking and 
cause and effect, as applied to selfadvancement, was known centuries ago, 
before the masses could read and write. 

Much has been written about the wise 
men of old. A popular fallacy has it that 
their secrets of personal power and successful living were lost to the world. 
Knowledge of nature's laws, accumulated through the ages, is never lost. At 
times the great truths possessed by the 
sages were hidden from unscrupulous 
men in high places, but never destroyed. 

Why Were Their Secrets 
Closely Guarded? 

Only recently, as time is measured; not 
more than twenty generations ago, less 
than l/100th of 1% of the earth's 
people were thought capable of receiving basic knowledge about the laws of 
life, for it is an elementary truism that 
knowledge is power and that power 
cannot be entrusted to the ignorant 
and the unworthy. 

Wisdom is not readily attainable by the 
general public; nor recognized when 
right within reach. The average person 
absorbs a multitude of details about 
things, but goes through life without 
ever knowing where and how to acquire 
mastery of the fundamentals of the inner 
mind — that mysterious silent something 
which "whispers" to you from within. 

Fundamental Laws of Nature 

Your habits, accomplishments and weaknesses are the effects of causes. Your 
thoughts and actions are governed by 
fundamental laws. Example: The law 



of compensation is as fundamental as 
the laws of breathing, eating and sleeping. All fixed laws of nature are as 
fascinating to study as they are vital to 
understand for success in life. 

You can learn to find and follow every 
basic law of life. You can begin at any 
time to discover a whole new world of 
interesting truths. You can start at once 
to awaken your inner powers of selfunderstanding and self-advancement. 
You can learn from one of the world's 
oldest institutions, first known in America in 1694. Enjoying the high regard 
cf hundreds of leaders, thinkers and 
teachers, the order is known as the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. Its complete name 
is the "Ancient and Mystical Order 
Rosae Crucis," abbreviated by the initials "AMORC." The teachings of the 
Order are not sold, for it is not a commercial organization, nor is it a religious 
sect. It is a non-profit fraternity, a 
brotherhood in the true sense. • 

Not For General Distribution 

Sincere men and women, in search of 
the truth — those who wish to fit in with 
the ways of the world — are invited to 
write for complimentary copy of the 
sealed booklet, "The Mastery of Life." 
It tells how to contact the librarian of 
L.ie archives of AMORC for this rare 
knowledge. This booklet is not intended 
for general distribution; nor is it sent 
without request. It is therefore suggested 
that you write for your copy to: Scribe
