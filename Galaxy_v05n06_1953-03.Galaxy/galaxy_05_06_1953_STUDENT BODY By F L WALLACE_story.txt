STUDENT BODY By F. L. WALLACE 

THE first morning that they 
were fillly committed to 
the planet, the executive 
officer stepped out of the ship. 
It was not quite dawn. Executive 
Hafner squinted in the early light ; 
his eyes opened wider, and he 
promptly went back inside. Three 
minutes later, he reappeared with 
the biologist in tow. 

"Last night you said there was 
nothing dangerous," said the executive. "Do you still think it's 
so?" 

Dario Marin stared. "I do." 
What his voice lacked in con


viction, it made up in embarrassment. He laughed uncertainly. 

"This is no laughing matter. 
I'll talk to you later." 

The biologist stood by the ship 
and watched as the executive 
walked to the row of sleeping 
colonists. 

"Mrs. Athyl," said the executive as he stopped beside the 
sleeping figure. 

She yawned, rubbed her eyes, 
rolled over, and stood up. The 
covering that should have been 
there, however, wasn't. Neither 
was the garment she had on when 



78 




 



she had gone to sleep. She assumed the conventional position 
of a woman who is astonished 
to find herself unclad without 
her knowledge or consent. 

"It's all right, Mrs. Athyl. 
I'm not a voyeur myself. Still, 
I think you should get some clothing on." Most of the colonists 
were awake now. Executive Hafner turned to them. "If you 
haven't any suitable clothing in 
the ship, the commissary will 
issue you some. Explanations will 
be given later." 

The colonists scattered. There 
was no compulsive modesty 
among them, for it couldn't have 
survived a year and a half in 
crowded spaceships. Nevertheless, it was a shock to awaken 
with no clothing on and not 
know who or what had removed 



it during the night. It was surprise more than anything else 
that disconcerted them. 

On his way back to the spaceship, Executive Hafner paused. 
"Any ideas about it?" 

Dano Marin shrugged. "How 
could I have? The planet is as 
new to me as it is to you." 

"Sure. But you're the biologist." 

As the only scientist in a crew 
of rough-and-ready colonists and 
builders, Marin was going to be 
called on to answer a lot of questions that weren't in his field. 

"Nocturnal insects, most likely," he suggested. That was pretty 
weak, though he knew that in 
ancient times locusts had stripped 
fields in a matter of hours. Could 
they do the same with the clothing of humans and not awaken

79 



them? "I'll look into the matter. 
As soon as I find anything, I'll 
let you know." 

"Good." Hafner nodded and 
went into the spaceship. 

"pvANO MARIN walked to the 
grove in which the colonists 
had been sleeping. It had been a 
mistake to let them bed down 
there, but at the time the request had been made, there had 
seemed no reason not to grant it. 
After eighteen months in crowded ships everyone naturally 
wanted fresh air and the rustle 
of leaves overhead. 

Marin looked out through the 
grove. It was empty now; the 
colonists, both men and women, 
had disappeared inside the ship, 
dressing, probably. 

The trees were not tall and 
the leaves were dark bottle-green. 
Occasional huge white flowers 
caught sunlight that made them 
seem larger than they were. It 
wasn't Earth and therefore the 
trees couldn't be magnolias. But 
they reminded Marin of magnolia 
trees and thereafter he always 
thought of them as that. 

The problem of the missing 
clothing was ironic. Biological 
Survey never made a mistake — 
yet obviously they had. They 
listed the planet as* the most suitable for Man of any so far 
discovered. Few insects, no dangerous animals, a most equitable 



climate. They had named it 
Glade because that was the word 
which fitted best. The whole land 
mass seemed to be one vast and 
pleasant meadow. 

Evidently there were things 
about the planet that Biological 
Survey had missed. 

Marin dropped to his knees and 
began to look for clues. If insects had been responsible, there 
ought to be a few dead ones, 
crushed, perhaps, as the colonists rolled over in their sleep. 
There were no insects, either live 
or dead. 

He stood up in disappointment 
and walked slowly through the 
grove. It might be the trees. At 
night they could exude a vapor 
which was capable of dissolving 
the material from which the 
clothing had been made. Farfetched, but not impossible. He 
crumbled a leaf in his hand and 
rubbed it against his sleeve. A 
pungent smell, but nothing happened. That didn't disprove the 
theory, of course. 

He looked out through the trees 
at the blue sun. It was bigger 
than Sol, but farther away. At 
Glade, it was about equal to 
the Sun on Earth. 

He almost missed the bright 
eyes that regarded him from the 
underbrush. Almost, but didn't 
— the domain of biology begins 
at the edge of the atmosphere; 
it includes the brush and the 



80 




 



small creatures that live in it. 

He swooped down on it. The 
creature fled squealing. He ran it 
down in the grass outside the 
grove. It collapsed into quaking 
flesh as he picked it up. He 
talked to it gently and the terror 
subsided. 

It nibbled contentedly on his 
jacket as he carried it back to the 
ship. 

EXECUTIVE Hafner stared' 
unhappily into the cage. It 
was an undistinguished animal, 



small and something like an undeveloped rodent. Its fur was 
sparse and stringy, unglamorous; 
it would never be an item in the 
fur export trade. 

"Can we exterminate it?" asked 
Hafner. "Locally, that is." 

"Hardly. It's ecologically 
basic." 

The executive looked blank. 
Dano Marin added the explanation: "You know how Biological 
Control works. As soon as a 
planet has been discovered that 
looks suitable, they send out a

81 



survey ship loaded with equipment. The ship flies low over a 
good part of the planet and the 
instruments in the ship record 
the neural currents of the animals 
below. The instruments can distinguish the characteristic neural 
patterns of anything that has a 
brain, including insects. 

"Anyway, they have a pretty 
good idea of the kinds of animals 
on the planet and their relative 
distribution. Naturally, the survey party takes a few specimens. 
They have to in order to correlate 
the pattern with the actual animal, otherwise the neural pattern 
would be merely a meaningless 
squiggle on a microfilm. 

"The survey shows that this 
animal is one of only four species 
of mammals on the planet. It is 
also the most numerous." 

Hafner grunted. "So if we kill 
them off here, others will swarm 
in from surrounding areas?" 

"That's about it. There are 
probably millions of them on 
this peninsula. Of course, if you 
want to put a barrier across the 
narrow connection to the mainland, you might be able to wipe 
them out locally." 

The executive scowled. A barrier was possible, but it would 
involve more work than he cared 
to expend. 

"What do they eat?" he asked 
truculently. 

"A little bit of everything, 



apparently. Insects, fruits, berries, nuts, succulents, and grain." 
Dano Marin smiled. "I guess it 
could be called an omnivore — 
now that our clothing is handy, it 
eats that, too." 

Hafner didn't smile. "I thought 
our clothing was supposed to be 
verminproof." 

Marin shrugged. "It is, on 
twenty-seven planets. On the 
twenty-eighth, we meet up with 
a little fella that has better digestive fluids, that's all." 

Hafner looked pained. "Are 
they likely to bother the crops i 
we plant?" 1 

"Offhand, I would say they 
aren't. But then I would have said 
the same about our clothing." 

Hafner made up his mind. "All | 
right. You worry about the crops. 
Find some way to keep them out 
of the fields. Meanwhile, everyone sleeps in the ship until we can f 
build dormitories." ■] 

Individual dwelling units would 
have been more appropriate in 
the colony at this stage, thought 
Marin. But it wasn't for him to 
decide. The executive was a man 
who regarded a schedule as some- J 
thing* to be exceeded. ' 

"The omnivore — " began Marin. | 

Hafner nodded impatiently. 
"Work on it," he said, and walked 
away. 

The biologist sighed. The omnivore really was a queer little 



82 




 



creature, but it was by no means 
the most important thing on 
Glade. For instance, why were 
there so few species of land animals on the planet? No reptiles, 
numerous birds, and only four 
kinds of mammals. 

Every comparable planet teemed with a wild variety of life. 
Glade, in spite of seemingly ideal 
conditions, hadn't developed. 
Why? 

He had asked Biological Controls for this assignment because 
it had seemed an interesting 
problem. Now, apparently, he 
was being pressed into service as 
an exterminator. 

He reached in the cage and 
picked up the omnivore. Mammals on Glade were not unexpected. Parallel development 
took care of that. Given roughly 
the same kind of environment, 
similar animals would usually 
evolve. 

In the Late Carboniferous forest on Earth, there had been 
creatures ^ike the omnivore, the 
primitive mammal from which 
all others had evolved. On Glade,' 
that kind of evolution just hadn't 
taken place. What had kept nature from exploiting its evolutionary potentialities? There was 
the real problem, not how to wipe 
them out. 

Marin stuck a needle in the 
omnivore. It squealed and then 
relaxed. He drew out the blood 



and set it back in the cage. He 
could learn a lot about the animal from trying to kill it. 

THE quartermaster was shouting, though his normal voice 
carried quite well. 

"How do you know it's mice?" 
the biologist asked him. 

"Look," said the quartermaster 
angrily. 

Marin looked. The evidence did 
indicate mice. 

Before he could speak, the 
quartermaster snapped, "Don't 
tell me they're only micelike 
creatures. I know that. The question is: how can I get rid of 
them?" 

"Have you tried poison?" 

"Tell me what poison to use 
and I'll use it." 

It wasn't the easiest question 
to answer. What was poisonous 
to an animal he had never seen 
and knew nothing about? According to Biological Survey, 
the animal didn't exist. . 

It was unexpectedly serious. 
The colony could live off the 
land, and was expected to. But 
another group of colonists was 
due in three years. The colony 
was supposed to accumulate a 
surplus of food to feed the increased numbers. If they couldn't 
store the food they grew any better than the concentrates, that 
surplus was going 'to be scanty. 

Marin went over the ware

83 



house thoroughly. It was the 
usual early construction on a 
colonial world. Not esthetic, it 
was sturdy enough. Fused dirt 
floor, reinforced foot-thick walls, 
a ceiling slab of the same. The 
whole was bound together with a 
molecular cement that made it 
practically airtight. It had no 
windows; there were two doors. 
Certainly it should keep out rodents. 

A closer examination revealed 
an unexpected flaw. The floor was 
as hard as glass; no animal could 
gnaw through it, but, like glass, 
it was also brittle. The crew that 
had built the warehouse had evidently been in such a hurry to 
get back to Earth that they hadn't 
been as careful as they should 
have been, for here and there the 
floor was thin. Somewhere under 
the heavy equipment piled on it, 
the floor had cracked. There a 
burrowing animal had means of 
entry. 

Short .of building another warehouse, it was too late to do 
anything about that. Micelike 
animals were inside and had to be 
controlled where they were. 

The biologist straightened up. 
"Catch me a few of them alive 
and I'll see what I can do." 

IN the morning, a dozen live 
specimens were delivered to 
the lab. They actually did resemble mice. 



Their reactions were puzzling. 
No two of them were affected by 
the same poison. A compound 
that stiffened one in a matter of 
minutes left the others hale and 
hearty, and the poison he had 
developed to control the omnivores was completely ineffective. 

The depredations in the warehouse went on. Black mice, white 
ones, gray and brown, shorttailed and long-eared, or the reverse, they continued to eat the 
concentrates and spoil what they 
didn't eat. 

Marin conferred with the executive, outlined the problem as 
he saw it and his ideas on what 
could be done to combat the 
nuisance. 

"But we can't build another 
warehouse," argued Hafner. "Not 
until the atomic generator is set 
up, at any rate. And then we'll 
have other uses for the power." 
The executive rested his head in 
his hands. "I like the other solution better. Build one and see how 
it works." 

"I was thinking of three," said 
the biologist. 

"One," Hafner insisted. "We 
can't spare the equipment until 
we know how it works." 

At that he was probably right. 
They had equipment, as much 
as three ships could bring. But 
the more they brought, the more 
was expected of the colony. The 



84 




 



net effect was that equipment 
was always in short supply. 

Marin took the authorization 
to the engineer. On the way, he 
privately revised his specifications 
upward. If he couldn't get as 
many as he wanted, he might as 
well get a better one. 

In two days, the machine was 
ready. 

It was delivered in a small 
crate to the warehouse. The crate 
was opened and the machine 
leaped out and stood there, 
poised. 

"A cat!" exclaimed the quartermaster, pleased. He stretched out 
his hand toward the black fuzzy 
robot. 

"If you've touched anything a 
mouse may have, get your hand 
away," warned the biologist. "It 
reacts to smell as well as sight 
and sound." 

Hastily, the quartermaster 
withdrew his hand. The robot disappeared silently into the maze 
of stored material. 

In one week, though there were 
still some mice in the warehouse, 
they were no longer a danger. 

THE executive called Marin into his office, a small sturdy 
building located in the center of 
the settlement. The colony was 
growing, assuming an aspect of 
permanency. Hafner sat in his 
ch^ir and looked out over that 
growth with satisfaction. 



"A good job on the mouse 
plague," he said. 

The biologist nodded. "Not 
bad, except there shouldn't be 
any mice here. Biological Survey — " 

"Forget it," said the exec. 
"Everybody makes mistakes, 
even B. S." He leaned back and 
looked seriously at the biologist. 
"I have a job I need done. Just 




now I'm short of men.. If you 
have no objections . . ." 

The exec was always short of 
men, would be until the planet 
was overcrowded, and he would 
try to find someone to do the 
work his own men should have 
done. Dano Marin was not directly responsible to Hafner; he was 
on loan to the expedition from 
Biological Controls. Still, it was 
a good idea to cooperate with the 
executive. He sighed. 

"It's not as bad as you think," 
said Hafner, interpreting the 



STUDENT BODY 



85 



sound correctly. He smiled. 
"We've got the digger together. I 
want you to run it." 

Since it tied right in with his 
investigations, Dano Martin looked relieved and showed it. 

"Except for food, we have to 
import most of our supplies," 
Hafner explained. "It's a long 
haul, and we've got to make use 
of everything on the planet we 
can. We need oil. There are going 
to be a lot of wheels turning, 
and everyone of them will have to 
have oil. In time we'll set up a 
synthetic plant, but if we can 
locate a productive field now, 
it's to our advantage." 

"You're assuming the geology 
of Glade is similar to Earth?" 

Hafner waggled his hand. 
"Why not? It's a nicer twin of 
Earth." 

Why not? Because you couldn't 
always tell from the surface, 
thought. Marin. It seemed like 
Earth, but was it? Here was a 
good chance to find out the history of Glade. 

Hafner stood up. "Any time 
you're ready, a technician will 
check you out on the digger. 
Let me know before you go." 

ACTUALLY, the digger wasn't 
a digger. It didn't move or 
otherwise displace' a gram of dirt 
or rock. It was a means of looking down below the surface, to 
any practical depth. A large 



crawler, it was big enough for a 
man to live in without discomfort for a week. 

It carried an outsize ultrasonic generator and a device for 
directing the beam into • the 
planet. That was the sending 
apparatus. The receiving end began with a large sonic lens which 
picked up sound beams reflected 
from any desired depth, converted 
it into electrical energy and 
thence into an image which was 
flashed onto a screen. 

At the depth of ten miles, the 
image was fuzzy, though good 
enough to distinguish the main 
features of the strata. At three 
miles, it was better. It could pick 
up the sound reflection of a 
buried coin and convert it into a 
picture on which the date could 
be seen. 

It was to a geologist as a microscope is to a biologist. Being 
a biologist, Dano Marin could 
appreciate the analogy. 

He started at the tip of the 
peninsula and zigzagged across, 
heading toward the isthmus. 
Methodically, he covered the 
territory, sleeping at night in th< 
digger. On the morning of thf 
third day, he discovered oil traces 
and by that afternoon he had located the main field. 

He should probably have turned back at once, but now that hf 
had found oil, he investigated 
more deliberately. Starting at the 



86 




 



top, he let the image range 
downward below the top strata. 

It was the reverse of what it 
should have been. In the top few 
feet, there were plentiful fossil 
remains, mostly of the four species of mammals. The squirrellike creature and the far larger 
grazing animal were the forest 
dwellers. Of the plains animals, 
there were only two, in size fitting 
neatly between the extremes of 
the forest dwellers. 

After the first few feet, which 
corresponded to approximately 
twenty thousand years, he found 
virtually no fossils. Not until he 
reached a depth which he could 
correlate to the Late Carboniferous age on Earth did fossils 
reappear. Then they were of animals appropriate to the epoch. 
At that depth and below, the 
history of Glade was quite similar to Earth's. 

Puzzled, he checked again in 
a dozen widely scattered localities. The results were always the 
same — fossil history for the first 
twenty thousand years, then none 
for roughly a hundred million. 
Beyond that, it was easy to trace 
the thread of biological development. 

In that period of approximately one hundred million years, 
something unique had happened 
to Glade. What was it? 

On the fifth day his investigations were interrupted by the 



sound of the keyed-on radio. 
"Marin." 

"Yes?" He flipped on the sending switch. 

"How soon can you get back?" . 

He looked at the photo-map. 
"Three hours. Two if I hurry." 

"Make it two. Never mind the 
oil." 

"I've found oil. But what's the 
matter?" 

"You can see it better than I 
can describe it. We'll discuss it 
when you get back." 




ELUCTANTLY, Marin re• tracted the instruments into 



the digger. He turned it around 
and, with not too much regard 
for the terrain, let it roar. The 
treads tossed dirt high in the air. 
Animals fled squealing from in 
front of him. If the grove was 
small e*nough, he went around it, 
otherwise he went through and 
left matchsticks behind. 

He skidded the crawler ponderously to halt near the edge of 
the settlement. The center of activity was the warehouse. Pickups 
wheeled in and out, transferring 
supplies to a cleared area outside. 
He found Hafner in a corner of 
the warehouse, talking to the engineer. 

Hafner turned around when he 
came up. "Your mice have grown, 
Marin." 

Marin looked down. The robot 
cat lay on the floor. He knelt 



STUDENT BODY 



87 



and examined it. The steel skeleton hadn't broken; it had been 
bent, badly. The tough plastic 
skin had been torn off and, inside, the delicate mechanism had 
been chewed into an unrecognizable mass. 

Around the cat were rats, 
twenty or thirty of them, huge 
by any standards. The cat had 
fought; the dead animals were 
headless or disembowled, unbelievably battered. But the robot 
had been outnumbered. 

Biological Survey had said 
there weren't any rats on Glade. 
They had also said that about 




mice. What was the key to their 
error? 

The biologist stood up. "What 
are you going to do about it?" 

"Build another warehouse, twofoot -thick fused dirt floors, monolithic construction. Transfer all 
perishables to it." 

Marin nodded. That would do 



it. It would take time, of course, 
and power, all they could draw 
out of the recently set up atomic 
generator. All other construction 
would have to be suspended. No 
wonder Hafner was disturbed. 

"Why not build more cats?" 
Marin suggested. 

The executive smiled nastily. 
"You weren't here when we 
opened the doors. The warehouse 
was swarming with rats. How 
many robot cats would we need 
— five, fifteen? I don't know. 
Anyway the engineer tells me we $ 
have enough parts to build three 1| 
more cats. The one lying there j 
can't be salvaged." 1 

It didn't take an engineer to 4 
see that, thought Marin. | 

Hafner continued, "If we need | 
more, we'll have to rob the com- | 
puter in the spaceship. I refuse f 
to permit that." 

Obviously he would. The spaceship was the only link with 
Earth until the next expedition 
brought more colonists. No exec 
in his right mind would permit 
the ship to be crippled. 

But why had Hafner called 
him back? Merely to keep him 
informed of the situation? 

HAFNER seemed to guess his 
thoughts. "At night we'll 
floodlight the supplies we remove 
from the warehouse. We'll post a 
guard armed with decharged 
rifles until we can move the food 



88 




 



into the new warehouse. That'll 
take about ten days. Meanwhile, 
our fast crops are ripening. It's 
my guess the rats will turn to 
them for food. In order to protect 
our future food supply, you'll 
have to activate your animals." 

The biologist started. "But it's 
against regulations to loose any 
animal on a planet until a complete investigation of the possible ill effects is made." 

"That takes ten or twenty 
years. This is an emergency and 
I'll be responsible — in writing, 
if you want." 

The biologist was effectively 
countermanded. Another , rabbitinfested Australia or the planet 
that the snails took over might 
be in the making, but there was 
nothing he could do about it. 

"I hardly think they'll be of 
any use against rats this size," 
he protested. 

"You've got hormones. Apply 
them." The executive turned and 
began discussing construction 
with the engineer. 

"ir/JARIN had the dead rats 
gathered up and placed in 
the freezer for further study. 

After that, he retired to the 
laboratory and worked out a 
course of treatment for the domesticated animals that the colonists had brought with them. 
He gave them the first injections 
and watched them carefully until 



they were safely through the initial shock phase of growth. As 
soon as he saw they were going 
to survive, he bred them. 

Next he turned to the rats. Of 
note was the wide variation in 
size. Internally, the same thing 
was true. They had the usual 
organs, but the proportions of 
each varied greatly, more than 
is normal. Nor were their teeth 
uniform. Some carried huge fangs 
set in delicate jaws; others had 
tiny teeth that didn't match the 
massive bone structure. As a species, they were the most scrambled the biologist had ever 
encountered. 

He turned the microscope on 
their tissues and tabulated the 
results. There was less difference 
here between individual specimens, but it was enough to set 
him pondering. The reproductive 
cells were especially baffling. 

Late in the day, he felt rather 
than heard the soundless whoosh 
of the construction machinery. He 
looked out of the laboratory and 
saw smoke rolling upward. As 
soon as the vegetation was charred, the smoke ceased and heat 
waves danced into the sky. 

They were building on a hill. 
The little creatures that crept and 
crawled in the brush attacked in 
the most vulnerable spot, the food 
supply. There was no brush, not 
a blade of grass, on the hill when 
the colonists finished.

TERRIERS. In the past, they 
were the hunting dogs of the 
agricultural era. What they lacked in size they made up in 
ferocity toward rodents. They 
had earned their keep originally 
in granaries and fields, and, for 
a brief time, they were doing it 
again on colonial worlds where 
conditions were repeated. 

The dogs the colonists brought 
had been terriers. They were still 
as fast, still with the same antirodent disposition, but they were 
no longer small. It had been a 
difficult job, yet Marin had done 
it well, for the dogs had lost 
none of their skill and speed in 
growing, to the size of a great 
dane. 

The rats moved in on the fields 
of fast crops. Fast crops were 
made to order for a colonial 
world. They could be planted, 
grown,-and- harvested in a matter 
of weeks. After four such plantings, the fertility of the soil was 
destroyed, but that meant nothing 
in the early years of a colonial 
planet, for land was plentiful. 

The rat tide grew in the fast 
crops, and' the dogs were loosed 
on the rats. They ranged through 
the fields, hunting. A rush, a snap 
of their jaws, the shake of a 
head, and the rat was tossed 
aside, its back broken. The dogs 
went on to the next. 

Until they could not see, the 
dogs prowled and slaughtered. 



At night they came in bloody, ; 
most of it not their own, and exhausted. Marin pumped them full 
of antibiotics, bandaged their 
wounds, fed them through their 
veins, and shot them into sleep. 
In the morning he awakened 
them with an injection of stimulant and sent them tingling into 
battle. 

It took the rats two days to 
learn they could not feed during 
the day. Not so numerous, they 
came at night. They climbed on 
the vines and nibbled the fruit. 
They gnawed growing grain and 
ravaged vegetables. 

The next day the colonists set 
up lights. The dogs were with 
them, discouraging the few rats 
who were still foolish enough to 
forage while the sun was overhead. 

An hour before dusk, Marin 
called the dogs in and gave them 
an enforced rest. He brought them 
out of it after dark and took them 
to the fields, staggering. T,he 
scent of rats revived them; they 
were as eager as ever, if not 
quite so fast. 

The rats came from the surrounding meadows, not singly, or 
in twos and threes, as they had 
before; this time they came together. Squealing and rustling 
the grass, they moved toward the 
fields. It was dark, and though 
he could not see them, Marin 
could hear them. He ordered the 



90 




 



great lights turned on in the area ' 
of the fields. 

The rats stopped under the 
glare, milling around uneasily. 
The dogs quivered and whined. 
Marin held them back. The rats 
resumed their march, and Marin 
released the dogs. 

The dogs charged in to attack, 
but didn't dare brave the main 
mass. They picked off the stragglers and forced the rats into a 
tighter formation. After that the 
rats were virtually unassailable. 

The colonists could have burned the bunched-up rats with the 
right equipment, but they didn't 
have it and couldn't get it for 
years. Even if they'd had it, the 
use of such equipment would endanger the crops, which they had 
to save if they could. It was 
up to the dogs. 

The rat formation came to the 
edge of the fields, and broke. 
They could face a common enemy and remain united, but in 
the presence of food, they forgot 
that unity and scattered — hunger 
was the great divisor. The dogs 
leaped joyously in pursuit. They 
hunted down the starved rodents, 
one by one, and killed them as 
they ate. 

When daylight came, the rat 
menace had ended. 

The next week the colonists 
harvested and processed the food 
for storage and immediately 
planted another crop. 




"jtflTARIN sat in the lab and 
J-'-l tried to analyze the situation. The colony was moving 
from crisis to crisis', all of them 
involving food. In itself, each 
critical situation was minor, but 
lumped together they could add 
up to failure. No matter how 
he looked at it, they just didn't 
have the equipment they needed 
to colonize Glade. 

The fault seemed to lie with 
Biological Survey; they hadn't 
reported the presence of pests 
that were endangering the food 
supply. Regardless of what the 



STUDENT BODY 



91 



exec thought about them, Survey knew their business. If they 
said there were no mice or rats on 
Glade, then there hadn't been 
any — when the survey was made. 

The question was: when did 
they come and how did they get 
here? 

Marin sat and stared at the 
wall, turning over hypotheses in 
his mind, discarding them when 
they failed to make sense. 

His gaze shifted from the wall 
to the cage of the omnivores, the 
squirrel-size forest creature. The 
most numerous animal on Glade, 
it was a commonplace sight to 
the colonists. 

And yet it was a remarkable 
animal, more than he had realized. Plain, insignificant in appearance, it might be the most 
important of any animal Man had 
encountered on the many worlds 
he had settled on. The longer he 
watched, the more Marin became 
convinced of it. 

He sat silent, observing the 
creature, not daring to move. He 
sat until it was dark and the 
omnivore resumed its normal activity. 

Normal? The word didn't apply on Glade. 

The interlude with the omnivore provided him with one 
answer. He needed another one; 
he thought he knew what it was, 
but he had to have more data, 
additional observations. 



He set up his equipment carefully on the fringes of the settlement. There and in no other place 
existed the information he wanted. 

He spent time in the digger, 
checking his original investigations. It added up to a complete 
picture. 

When he was certain of his 
facts, he called on Hafner. 

The executive was congenial; 
it was a reflection of the smoothness with which the objectives of 
the colony were being achieved. 

"Sit down," he said affably. 
"Smoke?" 

The biologist sat down and took 
a Cigarette. 

"I thought you'd like to know 
where the mice came from," he 
began. 

Hafner smiled. "They don't 
bother us any more." 

"I've also determined the origin of the rats." 

"They're under control. We're 
doing nicely." 

ON the contrary, thought Marin. He searched for the proper beginning. 

"Glade has an Earth-type 
climate and topography," he said. 
"Has had for the past twenty 
thousand years. Before that, 
about a hundred million years 
ago, it was also like Earth of 
the comparable period." 

He watched the look of polite

interest settle on the executive's 
face as he stated the obvious. 
Well, it was obvious, up to a 
point. The conclusions weren't, 
though. 

"Between a hundred million 
years and twenty thousand years 
ago, something happened to 
Glade," Marin went on. "I don't 
know the cause; it belongs to 
cosmic history and we may never 
find out. Anyway, whatever the 
cause — fluctuations in the sun, 
unstable equilibrium of forces 
within the planet, or perhaps an 
encounter with an interstellar, 
dust cloud of variable density — 
the climate on Glade changed. 

"It changed with inconceivable violence and it kept on 
changing. A hundred million 
years ago, plus or minus, there 
was carboniferous forest on 
Glade. Giant reptiles resembling 
dinosaurs and tiny mammals 
roamed through it. The first great 
change wiped out the dinosaurs, 
as it did on Earth. It didn't 
wipe out the still more primitive 
ancestor of the omnivore, because it could adapt to changing 
conditions. 

"Let me give you an idea how 
the conditions changed. For a 
few years a given area would be 
a desert; after that it would turn 
into a jungle. Still later a glacier 
would i>egin to form. And then 
the cycle would be repeated, with 
wild variations. All this might 



happen — did happen — within a 
span covered by the lifetime of a 
single omnivore. This occurred 
many times. For roughly a hundred million years' it was the 
norm of existence on Glade. This 
condition was hardly conducive 
to the preservation of fossils." 

Hafner saw the significance and 
was concerned. "You mean these 
climatic fluctuations suddenly 
stopped, twenty thousand years 
ago? Are they likely to begin 
again?" 

"I don't know," confessed the 
biologist. "We can probably determine it if we're interested." 

The exec nodded grimly. 
"We're interested, all right." 

Maybe we are, thought the biologist. He said, "The point is 
that survival was difficult. Birds 
could and did fly to more suitable climates; quite a few of them 
survived. Only one species of 
mammals managed to come 
through." 

"Your facts are not straight," 
observed Hafner. "There are four 
species, ranging in size from a 
squirrel to a water buffalo." 

"One species," Marin repeated 
doggedly. "They're the same. If 
the food supply for the largest 
animal increases, some of the 
smaller so-called species grow up. 
Conversely, if food becomes 
scarce in any category, the next 
generation, which apparently can 
be produced almost instantly, 



STUDENT BODY 



93 



switches to a form which does 
have an adequate food supply." 

"The mice," Hafner said slowly
"|t/|ARIN finished the thought 
for him. "The mice weren't 
here when we got here. They 
were born of the squirrel-size omnivore." 

Hafner nodded. "And the 
rats?" 

"Born of the next larger size. 
After all, we're environment, too 
— perhaps the harshest the beasts 
have yet faced." 

Hafner was a practical man, 
trained to administer a colony. 
Concepts were not his familiar 
ground. "Mutations, then? But I 
thought—" 

The biologist smiled. It was 
thin and cracked at the edges of 
his mouth. "On Earth, it would 
be mutation. Here it is merely 
normal evolutionary adaptation." 
He shook his head. "I never 
told you, but omnivores, though 
they could be mistaken for an 
animal from Earth, have no 
genes or chromosomes. Obviously they do have heredity, but 
how it is passed down, I don't 
know. However it functions, it 
responds to external conditions 
far faster than anything we've 
ever encountered." 

Hafner nodded to himself. 
"Then we'll never be free from 
pests." He clasped and unclasped 



his hands. "Unless, of course, we 
rid the planet of all animal life." 

"Radioactive dust?" asked the 
biologist. "They have survived 
worse." 

The exec considered alternatives. "Maybe we should leave 
the planet and leave it to the 
animals." 

"Too late," said the biologist. 
"They'll be on Earth, too, and 
all the planets we've settled on." 

Hafner looked at him. The 
same pictures formed in his mind 
that Marin had thought of. Three 
ships had been sent to colonize 
Glade. One had remained with 
the colonists, survival insurance 
in case anything unforeseen happened. Two had gone back to 
Earth to carry the report that 
all was well and that more supplies were needed. They had also 
carried specimens from the 
planet. 

The cages those creatures were 
kept in were secure. But a smaller 
species could get out, must already be free, inhabiting, undetected, the cargo spaces of the 
ships. 

There was nothing they could 
do to intercept those ships. And 
once they reached Earth, would 
the biologists suspect? Not for a 
long time. First a new kind of rat 
would appear. A mutation could 
account for that. Withoutspecific 
knowledge, there would be nothing to connect it with the speci

mens picked up from Glade. 

"We have to stay," said the 
biologist. "We have to study them 
and we can do it best here." 

He thought of the vast complex of buildings on Earth. There 
was too much invested to tear 
them down and make them verminproof. Billions of people 
could not be moved off the planet 
while the work was being done. 

They were committed to Glade 
not as a colony, but as a gigantic 
laboratory. They had gained one 
planet and lost the equivalent of 
ten, perhaps more when the destructive properties of the omnivores were finally assessed. 
A rasping animal cough interrupted the biologist's thoughts. 
Hafner jerked his head and 



glanced out the window. Lips 
tight, he grabbed a rifle off the 
wall and ran out. Marin followed 
him. 

HPHE EXEC headed toward the 
fields where the second fast 
crop was maturing. On top of a 
knoll, he stopped and knelt. He 
flipped the dial to extreme 
charge, aimed, and fired. It was 
high; he missed the animal in 
the field. A neat strip of smoking 
brown appeared in the green 
vegetation. 

He aimed more carefully and 
fired again. The charge screamed 
out of the muzzle. It struck the 
animal on the forepaw. The 
beast leaped high in the air and 
fell down, dead and broiled.

They stood over the animal 
Hafner had killed. Except for 
the lack of markings, it was a 
good imitation of a tiger. The 
exec prodded it with his toe. 

"We chase the rats out of the 
warehouse and they go to the 
fields," he muttered. "We hunt 
them down in the fields with 
dogs and they breed tigers." 

"Easier than rats," said Marin. 
"We can shoot tigers." He bent 
down over the slain dog near 
which they had surprised the big 
cat. 

The other dog came whining 
from the far corner of the field 
to which he had fled in terror. 
He was a courageous dog, but he 
could not face the great carnivore. He whimpered and licked 
the face of his mate. 

The biologist picked up the 
mangled dog and headed toward 
the laboratory. 

"You can't save her," said 
Hafner morosely. "She's dead." 

"But the pups aren't. We'll 
need them. The rats won't disappear merely because tigers have 
showed up." 

The head drooped limply over 
his arm and blood seeped into 
his clothing as Hafner followed 
him up the hill. 

"We've been here three 
months," the exec said suddenly. 
"The dogs have been ih the fields 
only two. And yet the tiger was 
mature. How do you account for 



something like that?" 

Marin bent under the weight 
of the dog. Hafner never would 
understand his bewilderment. As 
a biologist, all his categories were 
upset. What did evolution explain? It was a history of organic 
life on a particular world. Beyond 
that world, it might not apply. 

Even about himself there were 
many things Man didn't know, 
dark patches in his knowledge 
which theory simply had to pass 
over. About other creatures, his * 
ignorance was sometimes limitless. 

Birth was simple; it occurred 
on countless planets. Meek grazing creatures, fierce carnivores — 
the most unlikely animals gave 
birth to their young. It happened 
all the time. And the young grew 
up, became mature and mated. 

He remembered that evening 
in the laboratory. It was accidental — what if he had been elsewhere and not witnessed it? They 
would not know what little they 
did. 

He explained it carefully to 
Hafner. "If the survival factor 
is high and there's a great disparity in size, the young need not 
ever be young. They may be born 
as fully functioning adults!" 

k LTHOTJGH not at the rate 
it had initially set, the colony 
progressed. The fast crops were 
slowed down and a more diversi

fied selection was planted. New 
buildings were constructed and 
the supplies that were stored in 
them were spread out thin, for 
easy inspection. 

The pups survived and within 
a year shot up to maturity. After 
proper training, they were released to the fields where they 
joined the older dogs. The battle 
against the rats went on; they 
were held in check, though the 
damage they caused was considerable. 

The original animal, unchanged in form, developed an appetite for electrical insulation. There 
was no protection except to keep 
the power on at all times. Even 
then there were unwelcome interruptions until the short was located and the charred carcass 
was removed. Vehicles were kept 
tightly closed or parked only in 
verminproof buildings. While the 
plague didn't increase in numbers, 
it couldn't be eliminated, either. 

There was a flurry of tigers, 
but they were larger animals and 
were promptly shot down. They 
prowled at night, so the colonists were assigned to guard the 
settlement around the clock. 
Where lights failed to reach, the 
infra-red 'scope did. As fast as 
they came, the tigers died. Except for the first one, not a single 
dog was lost. 

The tigers changed, though not 
in form. Externally, they were 



all big and powerful killers. But 
as the slaughter went on, Marin 
noticed one astonishing fact — the 
internal organic structure became 
progressively more immature. 

The last one that was brought 
to him. for examination was the 
equivalent of a newly born cub. 
That tiny stomach was suited 
more for the digestion of milk 
than meat. How it had furnished 
energy to drive those great muscles was something of a miracle. 
But drive it had, for a murderous fifteen minutes before the 
animal wars brought down. No 
lives were lost, though sick bay 
was kept busy for a while. 

That was the last tiger they 
shot. After that, the attacks 
ceased. 

The seasons passed and nothing 
new occurred. A spaceship civilization or even that fragment of 
it represented by the colony was 
too much for the creature, which 
Marin by now had come to think 
of as the "Omnimal." It had 
evolved out of a cataclysmic 
past, but it could not meet the 
challenge of the harshest environment. 

Or so it seemed. 

rwiHREE months before the next 
-■- colonists were due, a new animal was detected. Food was missing from the fields. It was not 
another tiger: they were carnivorous. Nor rats, for vines were 



STUDENT BODY 



97 



stripped in a manner that no 
rodent could manage. 

The food was not important. 
The colony had enough in storage. But if the new animal signaled another plague, it was 
necessary to know how to meet it. 
The sooner they knew what the 
animal was, the better defense 
they could set up against it. 

Dogs were useless. The animal 
roamed the field they were loose 
in, and they did not attack nor 
even seem to know it was there. 

The colonists were called upon 
for guard duty again, but it evaded them. They patrolled for a 
week and they still did not catch 
sight of it. 

Hafner called them in and rigged up an alarm system in the 
field most frequented by the animal. It detected that, too, and 
moved its sphere of operations 
to a field in which the alarm system had not been installed. 

Hafner conferred with the engineer, who devised an alarm that 
would react to body radiation. 
It was buried in the original field 
and the old alarm was moved to 
another. 

Two nights later, just before 
dawn, the alarm rang. 

Marin met Hafner at the edge 
of the settlement.. Both carried 
rifles. They walked; the noise of 
any vehicle was likely to frighten 
the animal. They circled around 
and approached the field from 



the rear. The men in the camp 
had been alerted. If they needed 
help, it was ready. 

They crept silently through the 
underbrush. It was feeding in 
the field, not noisily, yet they 
could hear it. The dogs hadn't 
barked. 

They inched nearer. The blue 
sun of Glade came up and shone 
full on their quarry. The gun 
dropped in Hafner's hand. He 
clenched his teeth and raised it 
again. 

Marin put out a restraining 
arm. "Don't shoot," he whispered. 

"I'm the exec here. I say it's 
dangerous." 

"Dangerous," agreed Marin, 
still in a whisper. "That's why 
you can't shoot. It's more dan'gerous than you know." 

Hafner hesitated and Marin 
went on. "The omnimal couldn't 
compete in the changed environment and so it evolved mice. We 
stopped the mice and it countered with rats. We turned back the 
rat and it provided the tiger. 

"The tiger was easiest of all 
for us and so it was apparently 
stopped for a while. But it didn't 
really stop. Another anima^ was 
being formed, the one you see 
there. It took the omnimal two 
years to create it — how, I don't 
know. A million years were required to evolve it on Earth." 

Hafner hadn't lowered the rifle 
and he showed no signs of doing 



98 




 



so. He looked lovingly into the 
sights, 

"Can't you see?" urged Marin. 
"We can't destroy the omnimal. 
It's on Earth now, and on the 
other planets, down in the storage areas of our big cities, masquerading as rats. And we've 
never been able to root out even 
our own terrestral rats, so how 
can we exterminate the omnimal?" 

"All the more reason to start 
now." Hafner's voice was flat. 

Marin struck the rifle down. 
"Are their rats better than ours?" 
he asked wearily. "Will their 
pests win or ours be stronger? 
Or will the two make peace, 
unite and interbreed, make war 
on us? It's not impossible; the 
omnimal could do it if interbreeding had a high survival factor. 

"Don't you still see? There is 
a progression. After the tiger, it 
bred this. If this evolution fails, 
if we shoot it down, what will it 
create next? This creature I 
think we can compete with. It's 
the one alter this that I do not 
want to face." 

IT HEARD them. It raised its 
-*- head and looked around. Slowly it edged away and backed 
toward a nearby grove. 

The biologist stood up and called softly. The creature scurried 
to the trees and stopped just in


side the shadows among them. 

The two men laid down their 
rifles. Together they approached 
the grove, hands spread open to 
show they carried no weapons. 

It came out to meet them. 
Naked, it had had no time to 
learn about clothing. Neither did 
it have weapons. It plucked a 
large white flower from the tree 
and extended this mutely as a 
sign of peace. 

"I wonder what it's like," said 
Marin. "It seems adult, but can 
it be, all the way through? What's 
inside that body?" 

"I wonder what's in his head," 
Hafner said worriedly. 

It looked very much like a 
man.
