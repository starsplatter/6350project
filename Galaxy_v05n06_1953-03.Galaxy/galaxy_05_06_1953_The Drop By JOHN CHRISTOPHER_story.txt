The Drop By JOHN CHRISTOPHER 

WATER was always short 
between planets, even 
on a ship like the Ironrod, so my first goal in Forbeston 
on Mars was always the pool. I 
stripped down to trunks, ultraviolet checked, and plunged out 
into the green-tinted water. After 
blowing around a while, I lay 
back and floated. Above, beyond 
the almost invisible protective 
dome, there was the purple velvet 
of the Martian sky, flecked, now 



that the Sun was low on the horizon, with the larger stars. One of 
them, unwinking and tremendous, 
was green — Earth, of course. 

From the pool to the club; the 
usual routine. The Senior Officers' 
Club was on the corner of 49th 
and X, just across from the De- . 
partment of Commerce building. 
I had belonged to it two years 
now, and at 34 was no longer the 
youngest member. A prodigy of 
31 had got his master's ticket two

or three months before. 

I checked in, and from his little 
cubbyhole Steve recognized me, 
which was certainly an honor. He 
brought my mail down from its 
box : half a dozen bills, two vocoletters from a distant cousin, and 
a pile of advertising voco-flips. 

Steve said: "Where've you 
been, Captain Newsam?" 

The individual naming was another part of his technique. I had 
noticed that people he really had 



known for years he just called 
"Captain," "Commodore," or 
whatever it was. 

"Venus to Mercury run," I 
told him. "Clarke's Point, Karsville, Mordecai — the usual." 

"You get around," he said. "I 
stick here." 

I'd heard the complaint from, 
him before, and also from others 
in Forbeston and at other landfalls. They mostly looked contented enough, though. 



THE DROP

"One place is like another," I 
told him tiredly. 

"Yes," he said. "I've heard 
that. What you're used to, I figure. Going in to eat?" 

"Directly." I dropped the vocoflips in a disposal chute. "Do 
something for me, Steve." 

"Any old thing. What is it?" 

"Check me Captain Gains." 

He didn't hesitate long, but I'm 
used to observing small actions 
and probing them — I did a thesis 
on behavior for my diploma. I 
saw Steve's eyes flicker, and the 
involuntary movement of his 
hands. 

He said: "I'll check him, Captain. I haven't seen him around 
much lately." v 

"How lately?" I asked quietly. 

He was smooth again now. 
"Well, you know how it is. With 
serving officers, you don't always 
know whether they're here or 
away. Even when they're at Forbeston, they don't always come 
into the club. Hunting trips and 
such." 

"Your memory's not bad, 
Steve. Just when did you last see 
him?" 

He pretended to consider. 
"Might be two months. How long 
you been gone?" 

"Just over two months." 

"Yes, I'd say that's about it." 

"Thanks. Check him for me 
all the same. Check him all over. 
I'm going in to eat."

I FOUND an empty table by 
the window, and ordered. 
This part of the club overlooked 
the playground of the Forbeston 
Junior School. I sat eating and 
watching the generation that 
would be prepared to take over 
when I had completed my twenty 
years in space and was ready to 
retire to that plantation up in 
the hills. I didn't notice when 
someone came up to the table. 
He tapped the back of my chair. 
"Mind if I join you?" 
It was Matthews, from the 
Firelike. I had run into him at 
various times, in various places, 
and liked him well enough. I % 
nodded, and he sat down. 
"Just in?" 
"Three hours." 

He nodded. "Been in over a 
week myself. We're on the Uranus trip now. That's a rough ■' 
job I'll be glad to see the end of. j 
We lost the Steelback on our j 
last run. It's a God-forsaken j 
stretch of sky." 

"One place is like another," I 
said. It was the conventional 
phrase. < 

Matthews glanced at me. "Glad J 
you think so." I 

"What else?" | 

"People get ideas," he said ! 
vaguely. "Do you go near the ] 
Earth at all on your present run?" | 

"The Moon. Clarke's Point. 
Why?" 

"We used to hit Tycho. | 
iALAXY SCIENCE FICTION • 



They've got a telescope there 
that's pretty good. I used to get 
into the observatory. You can 
make out some small groups of 
buildings on Earth when the 
weather's right." 

The conversation was becoming embarrassing. To mention 
Earth at all was bad enough; to 
speak of "weather" was something worse. I looked at Matthews. He seemed normal, but I 
thought I detected a watchfulness behind the placidity of his 
expression. 

I said deliberately: "I've never 
given it a thought." 

"Sometimes people get to acting peculiar. We had a second officer with us three or four years 
back. He got an idea in his head 
that the Earth was raising a battle fleet. He used to spend his 
off-duty time at the lookout 
screen watching for the enemy 
cruisers approaching." 

I laughed. "What did they do 
with him?" 

"Gave him the drop. I guess 
he knows better by now." 

"If he's still alive." 

Matthews paused for a moment. "Have you ever wondered 
why we drop the misfits back to 
Earth?" 

I looked at him again. "What 
is there to think about? The reason's obvious enough. Since the 
ruling was made against prefrontal leucotomy, it's the only 

THE DROP 



alternative to snuffing them out, 
unless they are kept in institutions at our expense." 

He drained his coffee. "I've 
known some to say that we should 
never have abandoned Earth. 
It's richer in natural resources 
than all the planets together." 

I added: "And populated to the 
tune of around a billion savages. 
We couldn't dispose of that lot, 
and we couldn't avoid being contaminated if we had to live 
among them. The reason our kind 
came to the planets was to get 
away from them, to be able to 
develop our superior civilization 
in peace and without interruption. We've got the Sirius proje.ct 
under way. In a couple of centuries we may be in a different 
solar system altogether." 

"Or we may not," Matthews 
corrected. "There have been quite 
a few earlier projects, starting 
with the Proxima Centauri project. That was two hundred years 
ago." 

"You sound pessimistic." 

"It's the Uranus trip," he said. 
He grinned. "Forget it. One place 
is like another. Doing anything 
tonight?" 

"Nothing much. Looking a 
friend up." 

"Yes," he said. "I thought you 
might be." 

The remark was, I felt, an enigmatic one. He left without waiting for me to ask him to clarify it.

1 PASSED Steve on the way 
out. 

"Any luck with Captain 
Gains?" I asked him. 

He shook his head. 

"Forget it then. I'm going along 
to his place. There'll be a message, even if he isn't there." 

Steve nodded. As I went out, 
he nicked the vidiphone switch 
in front of him. 

Larry's bubble was seven or 
eight kilometers outside the city. 
I took my own car to the West 
Lock ' and picked up a sand 
tracker there. The Sun had set 
when I got outside the city bubble, but Phobos was up and I 
didn't need to use the main lights 
to see my way. I made a good 
twenty and in about a quarter 
hour was under the ridge on 
which the bubble that surrounded 
Larry's place was fixed. I could 
see it shimmering in the full 
moonlight, but there was no sign 
of a light within. 

I parked the tracker outside 
and went in. The lock was automatic ; as it closed behind me, the 
main lights inside went on. Larry's shack was in front of me. I 
pushed the door open. The living 
room looked reasonably tidy, but 
there was dust that showed no 
one had been in it for some weeks, 
at least. I went straight across 
to the vidiphone and pressed the 
message button. The screen 
stayed blank. 



-This was unusual. There should 
have been some kind of message. 
I set out to hunt through the 
shack for some kind of clue, but 
there was nothing. 

Larry Gains and I had gone 
through college at Tycho together, and we graduated together. Our first four years in space 
we were on the same boat — the 
Graylance on the Asteroid Circuit — and after the inevitable 
split came with my posting to the 
Ironrod, we still saw as much of 
each other as our wanderings 
permitted. Fortunately, both 
boats were based on Forbeston. 

Six months before, the old 
Graylance had made its last loop 





 



round the Belt; a chunk of rock 
weighing twenty tons or more 
had torn her open. Larry had 
been one of the survivors, but 
with injuries enough to ground 
him for at least a year. It was 
then he had had this shack put 
up. It was a handy base from 
which to hunt rocktrotters. I had 
stayed out there with him on a 
couple of leaves. Now the place 
was deserted. 

Might he have been seconded 
back into space on a special 
board? But there would have 
been a message, either at the club 
or here. An extended trip, up onto 
the Kayser Plateau? Then again 
there should have been a mes


sage; but he might not have expected to be away for long. That 
seemed the only possible solution. 

But there was the thick dust, 
and there had been that funny 
look in Steve's eye when I had 
mentioned Larry. 

I began hunting aimlessly 
around the hut again. A tape of 
the Forbeston edition of the 
Tychb Capsule. I clipped it into 
the screen. 24 — 7. That made it 
just over two months old. 

I heard the door open behind 
me and turned around, half expecting to see Larry himself 
there. But instead there were two 
men in Medical uniform. One of 
them stepped forward. 

"Captain Newsam?" He framed 
it as a question, but it was a 
statement. I knew that and 
nodded. 

"Just a checkup," he said. 

"I had a - checkup. This afternoon. When I got in with the 
Ironrod." 

"That's all right," the Medic 
said. "We won't keep you long." 

"You won't keep me at all, I've 
had my checkup. You can reach 
me through Venus Base, if you're 
interested." 

I moved to pass them. The one 
who had been talking didn't do 
anything. The other raised his 
left hand and shook it gently. 
Venusian arodate, of course, and 
they themselves immunized 



against it. I saw the golden dust 
shake out toward me and had 
time to run two or three paces 
before my muscles locked and 
everything went black. 

WHEN I awoke, I was in the 
Medical building, back in 
Forbeston. My muscles were still 
rigid. I was on a stretcher underneath the Verifier. The two 
Medics were there, and a Medic 
Captain. He was a little tubby 
man with ginger whiskers and a 
toothy grin. 

He said: "Sorry about the informality. Just a routine. We did 
have a warrant, incidentally, in 
case you should feel like registering a complaint against us." 

Being underneath the Verifier 
explained the arodate, but it 
didn't explain why. I thought of 
saying something and then decided to keep my mouth shut. 
The electrodes were clamped 
neatly behind my ears. The globe 
of the Verifier glowed its normal 
pink. 

The Captain said : "My name's 
Pinski. Now, Captain Newsam, 
you are Chief Navigator of the 
Ironrod, on the Venus-Mercury 
run?" 

"Yes." 

"Landfall five hours back?" 
"If I've been out half an hour, 
yes." 

The questions continued. For 
the most part, they were routine. 



118 




 



Pinski kept one eye on the Verifier globe, Then he started tossing in a few more unusual ones. 

"Ever been among the outer 
planets?" 

"Beyond the Asteroids? No." 

"Do you know Commander 
Leopold?" 

"No." % 

"Commander Stark?" 

"No." 

"What are your views on prefrontal leucotomy?" 

"Never thought about it. It's 
not used now, is it? They give 
them the drop." 

"What do you think of the 
Sirius project?" 

"Not much interested." 

"Do you ever dream of wide 
stretches of water?" 

"Not since I was a boy." 

I had no reason to fear anything from the Verifier, so it 
didn't make me nervous. The 
globe stayed pink as the questions went on. 

Pinski said: "What were you 
doing at the place where the 
Medics found you?" 

"I was looking for Captain 
Gains. Perhaps you'll tell me 
where I can get hold of him." 

Pinski grinned. "I'm not under 
the Verifier, Captain Newsam." 
He stepped back. "I think that's 
all okay. Sorry to have bothered, 
you. In two or three minutes 
you'll be able to get around 
again. Call in the Bar on your 



way out. Third on the right along 
the corridor. I'll be in there. The 
drinks are on Medical." 

I found him all right. He was 
sitting at a table with two drinks 
in front of him. Someone must 
have told him I drank sloe gin. 
I sat down at the empty chair, 

"Glad to make your acquaintance in a more formal manner, 
Captain Newsam," Pinski said. 
"Have a drink." 

I took it. "Now just why — " 

He lifted one hand. "To get 
things quite straight, I can give 
you no information as to the reason for your being picked up and 
verified." 

"Right," I said. "Then do you 
know where I can find Gains?" 

He hesitated briefly. "The answer must be no." 

I swallowed the drink. "Thank 
you very much for all the hospitality. Good night, Captain Pinski." 

"A piece of strictly medical advice," he said. "Go back to bed 
and have a good night's sleep." 

I called back, "Thanks!" I 
was halfway to the door. 

FORBESTON, like all landfalls 
on the interplanetary routes, 
has its less respectable side. I 
drove down to the East side and 
parked the car at the corner of 
90th and J. The Persepolis is a 
small club at the far end of 90th. 
I'm known there, but every time 



THE DROP

I go I feel less and less like boasting of it. I had a couple of sloe 
gins at the Bar and then went up 
to the Saturn Room. Cynthia 
came at me from behind. 

"Hello! Long time." 

"Seems longer," I said. "Tell 
me, when was Larry in last?" 

"Larry? I haven't seen him 
since you were both up here — 
nine, ten weeks ago. But I've been 
away on a trip up the Long Canal. Tell you what, I'll ask Sue." 

"That'll, be fine," I said. 

She was gone two or three minutes. When she came back, she 
said: "No. He doesn't seem to 
have been around since then." 

But she wasn't being spontaneous any longer; she was weighing her words. And she didn't 
seem at all curious as to what 
might have happened to him. 

"I thought we were friends, 
Cynth," I said. "Come on, what 
is it?" 

"What's what? I could do with, 
a drink." 

I dropped a note on the table. 
"Have this one on Larry. See 
you, Cynthia." 

She caught me before I reached 
the door. 

"I don't know, Jake. I honestly 
don't know. All I was told was 
that it was best not to inquire." 

She was telling the truth now. 

"Thanks," I said. "Good night, 
anyway." 

"Where are you going?" 

120 G 



"There's only one place where :J? 
I stand a chance of finding things $ 

out." " ,| 

I was thinking about that as 
I went outside. The Terminal Of- :' 
fice had tabs on all officers on 
the space routes. If Larry had 
not been reporting for his fortnightly medical boards, they 
would know, and they would certainly have checked to see what 
was happening. If there was 
something else wrong, they would 
know that, too. 

I jumped into the car without 
thinking and released power. 

Behind me, a familiar voice 
said: "You don't seem to have 
had any luck in rinding your 
friend, Captain Newsam." 

It was Matthews. His tall body 
was cramped into the back of the 
car. 

"Good of you to join me," I 
said. 

"I'd like you to drop in at my 
place. It's on 72nd." 

"Is there anything at the end 
of it? Information?" 

"A drink. Maybe information." 

"Suits me," I told him, and 
headed there. 

TT was a more luxurious apart ment than I thought Matthews 
could have afforded. Four rooms, 
all well furnished. He set me 
down in a long chair in front of 
a glow-fire and brought me the 
drink. He had it right, too — sloe 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



gin — but the fact that everyone 
knew my taste in liquor had 
ceased to worry me. 

"Now," I said, "I want to know 
where Larry Gains is." 

Matthews raised his eyebrows. 
"Gains? Ah, he must be this 
friend you didn't find." 

I said wearily : "What information do you think I came here 
for?" 

"I thought you came for the 
drink. No, don't go. If you try 
the Terminal Office at this time 
of night, you'll only get the clerk, 
who will tell you to come back 
in the morning. Finish your drink 
and have another. I understand 
you got picked up for verification 
earlier this evening." 

"Yes." 

"What sort of questions did 
they ask you?" I told him and 
he nodded. "Leopold . . . Stark 
. . . That's interesting." 

"Just what is it all about?" 

He paused. "That little talk 
we had this afternoon. Remember 
it?" 

"More or less. You were talking about misfits." 

Matthews looked straight at 
me. "Captain Larry Gains was 
classified as a misfij three weeks 
ago. He was dropped to Earth 
over a week ago. Is that what you 
wanted to know?" 

"You're off your rocker yourself. Larry was perfectly sane 
when I saw him just over two 



months ago. It takes two boards 
three months apart for misfit 
classification." 

"Not," Matthews said softly, 
"for classification 3-K." 

"3-K? What in hell is that?" 

"Organized activities against 
the State'" 

"Larry? Don't be funny!" 

"Tell me," Matthews said, 
"what do you know about the 
Earth?" 

"Ordinary general knowledge. 
That when the Third Atomic 
War broke out on Earth, the colonies on the Moon and here on 
Mars declared their neutrality. 
The technical staffs on the Earth 
bases for the most part pulled 
out to join them; those that didn't 
presumably got submerged in the 
holocaust. The state of the war 
was followed by wireless until the 
last transmitter went off the air, 
marking the breakdown. The colonies concentrated on their own 
expansion — first, on the Moon 
and Mars; later, on Venus and 
with the outposts in the Asteroids, and on the moons of Jupiter, 
Saturn and Uranus. There was 
no point in going back to an 
Earth poisoned with radioactive 
gases, with a savage population 
rotted by radiation diseases. The 
obvious thing was to expand outward, toward other solar systems." 

"And, of course," Matthews 
said, "there was the Protocol." 



THE DROP 



121 



THE Protocol, I suppose, could 
be called the basis of our 
education — that the old and outworn should be put behind; that 
Man should go on to greater 
things, never turning back to the 
world of misery and wretchedness 
to which he had for so long been 
confined. There was a lot more,but that was the gist of it. Children learned it by heart. 

"Yes, the Protocol," I said. 
"The Protocol rose naturally 
enough out of the circumstances." 

"Out of the circumstances," 
Matthews agreed. "But circumstances change. The Protocol remains the same." 
"Why shouldn't it?" 
"Well, grubbing around from 
one artificial environment to another — do you think that's the 
best existence men can have? 
Turning our backs on an unbelievably fruitful planet?" 

"It's only a temporary phase. 
The Sirius project-—" 

" — is a failure," Matthews cut 
in. "We won't be told about that 
officially until a new project has 
been got going — another carrot in 
front of the donkey. But it's a 
failure. Two planets, neither one 
habitable or capable of being 
made habitable." 

I said slowly: "Now perhaps 
you will tell me just what all this 
has to do with Larry Gains." " 

Matthews got up and walked 
across to the telescreen. He 



touched a small switch on the 
left-hand side, and the screen 
moved into patterns of whorls 
spreading out from the center. I 
recognized it for a watcheralarm: if anyone were tapping 
the room, the whorls would be 
irregular and broken. Matthews 
came back and sat down again. 

"Gains had a lot of time on 
his hands after his crackup. He 
-got to thinking things over. He 
happened to meet someone in 
our group. To put it shortly, he 
joined us." 

"Your group? Joined you? Who 
are you?" 

"We represent a party whose 
objective is to overthrow the Protocol. We want to get back to 
Earth, to recolonize it and reclaim it from savagery. Gains 
came in with us." 

"You're crazy! What makes 
you think you know better than 
the Directorate? We're improving 
conditions on the planets every 
year. Why, the new bubble up 
the Long Canal takes in over 
forty square kilometers!" 

"Bigger bubbles," Matthews 
said, "but always bubbles. Never 
the chance to live a natural life 
in natural surroundings." 

"And Larry? You let him get 
caught?" 

"It was bad luck." 

"Bad luck?" 

"He and another of our group 
had their conversation tapped. 



122 




 



They were both taken. Fortunately, neither of them knew 
more than a couple of other people in the group, and those two 
people got away. We couldn't do 
anything for Gains and Bessemer. 
They were held strictly incommunicado." 

"So he's really gone. You're 
sure they're not still holding him 
somewhere?" 

"On some points our information is definite. They've been 
dropped all right. On the North 
American continent — that's the 
usual place they drop misfits." 

SOMETHING had been worrying me all along, and suddenly I knew what it was. 

I said warily: "Well, I've got 
the information I came in search 
of. Now I'm beginning to wonder 
why I got it. I don't imagine you 
thought I would be a cinch for 
your organization just because 
Larry had been in it, did you? 
And yet you've told me a lot 
which you can't be in the habit 
of passing out casually. What's 
behind it?" 

"Well, we haven't told you anything the Directorate doesn't 
know," Matthews said evenly. 
"Except that I'm in it, and I 
have my means of getting away, 
in any case, I'm expendable. But 
you're correct in thinking there 
was a reason. Gains was a good 
friend of yours." 



"The best." 

"He was a good man. We didn't 
want to lose him, and we'd like 
to get him back." 

"Back? From Earth?" 

"We have a small cruiser at 
our disposal that is confidential and I've burned both your 
boats and ours by telling you — 
and we can get down to the Earth 
and back again. It isn't easy, and 
of course there can be no question 
of organizing search parties. But 
if someone else were dropped, 
with instructions for- Gains and 
Bessemer as to a spot to go to to 
•be picked up, all three could be 
taken off. We're lucky that misfits are always dropped in more 
or less the same area. It means 
finding them is made easier for 
us. It might be possible." 

"What's known about conditions in that part of the planet?" 

Matthews looked at me levelly. 
"Not a thing." 

I paused. "All right, I'll go. 
How?" 

Matthews smiled. "I thought 
you would. As for going — that's 
easy. You intended to drop in at 
the Terminal Office. Do that. If 
you are persistent, they'll inform 
you about Gains. After that, it's 
easy. You will be under automatic examination at the Office, 
and the shot of adrenalin you 
will take before you go over there 
will register. You will be pulled 
in on suspicion. Certain papers 



THE DROP 



will have been planted in your 
things at the Club. From that 
point on, things will be straightforward. All we have to do is just 
hope that when they verify you 
again, they keep a reasonable distance from suspicion of what's 
really happening. I think they 
will. Verifiers aren't very good 
nowadays." 

"Thanks," I said. "You seem 
to have everything well worked 
out. Just as a matter of interest, 
that remark about burning both 
my boats and yours — if I hadn't 
volunteered for this, what would 
you have done?" 

"We were fairly sure of you," 
Matthews said. "But if we had 
been wrong . . ." 

He turned his thumb down 
very regretfully. 

T WAS surprised how quickly 
■■■ the proceedings were rushed 
through. The papers Matthews 
had had planted in my gear must 
have been very incriminating. I 
was transferred to the Moon, to 
Archimedes Crater, for the final 
decision, but it was cut-and-dried 
beforehand. Within a week of my 
conversation with Matthews, I 
was standing in front of the 
Board, listening to myself being 
pronounced a misfit and condemned to the drop back to 
Earth. I was marched out. 

Someone was waiting for me 
in an anteroom. It was Pinski. 



I said: "I've been verified three 
times in a week. I'd never have 
thought you would have needed 
any more." 

Pinski smiled. "This time it's 
different. You have a compulsory 
total recall to go through." 

"You can't do that. Regulation 
75 states that no one can be put 
under a form of interrogation 
that his conscious mind cannot 
observe. The Verifier is the limit." 

"You know the regulation," 
Pinski said, "ex-Captain Newsam. Unfortunately, they don't 
apply to you any longer. The 
State has cast you out. This won't 
take very long." 

So much, I though grimly, for 
Matthews' sources of information. There was nothing I could 
do now. I could resist, but that 
would only mean being put into 
an arodate paralysis. 

"Sit down," Pinski said. 

The little silver balls began to 
revolve ; the mirrors gleamed with 
strange lights. I heard Pinski's 
voice, close at first, and then 
from greater and greater echoing 
distances. 

After an indefinite space of 
time, Pinski's voice again: 

"Wake up, Newsam. Wake up." 

I raised my head, my mind 
clear. Pinski was looking at me 
commiseratingly. 

"You've had tough luck," he 
observed. "They certainly roped 
you in." 



124 




 



I wasn't sure how much they 
had got from me, though I 
guessed it would be everything. 

"I'm not complaining," I said. 

"There's no provision for reclassifying misfits, I'm sorry to 
say. If there were, we might have 
saved you. As it is . . . you can 
take the drop in the satisfaction 
that you've done the Directorate 
a final service. We didn't know 
about that cruiser." He paused. 
"The boat's outside. Good luck, 
Newsam." 

We shook hands. The guards 
took me outside, through the lock 
to the Main Ramp. I had a last 
look at Archimedes, spread 
squatly around under its glistening bubble, and went through into 
the boat — a light coracle. 

During the takeoff and the 
three-hour journey toward Earth, 
I had time to consider things. 
Matthews' little scheme had been 
nicely blown up. When the cruiser 
arrived at the rendezvous that 
had been arranged, there would 
be a handy battle fleet waiting 
for it. What fools they were, anyway, to attempt to outwit the 
Directorate! As for resettling the 
Earth ... I had the job of doing 
it on my own now, with the aid 
of Larry and this fellow Bessemer — if I could find them at all. 

r|iHE coracle dropped into an 
-■- orbit, and they made the final 
arrangements for the drop. Mat


thews had been right, at least, in 
saying that they didn't drop misfits at random. The whole thing 
was meticulously calculated. 
When they finished, I was fitted 
up in the dropsuit. 

The captain of the coracle, a 
small, morose fellow, gave me instructions. 

"The five retard jets will fire 
"automatically. After the fifth, the 
first parachute comes into action, 
and ten seconds later the second." 
He grinned sadly. "If nothing has 
happened after fifteen seconds, 
you'll know something has gone 
wrong in the packing. You'll 
smash flat in that case, killed 
outright. You'll feel no pain whatever." 

"Thanks," I said. 

"We've never had any complaints before, but then I suppose 
we wouldn't. The spot you are to 
hit is the place we always send 
misfits. Out of the generosity of 
the Directorate, it's good hunting 
ground and, if you survive long 
enough, you can probably even 
farm it. Within easy reach of the 
ocean, too. Used to be called New 
Hampshire." 

"Any provisions?" 

"Concentrated food for a week. 
And a Klaberg pistol with a hundred rounds. I'd look after them 
if I were you — which I'm glad 
I'm not, incidentally." 

They eased me out of the lock 
with stopwatch timing. I didn't 



THE DROP

wait for the airblast to pvsh me 
clear; I sprang off myself. As I 
did so, the clearance jet pushed 
behind me. Tumbling over and 
over in space, I saw the coracle 
shrink behind me like a deflating 
balloon. I was on my own now 
with a vengeance. 

Just after the fifth retard jet, 
a thought struck me and sent a 
prickling apprehension down my 
spine. Matthews had failed to 
anticipate the compulsory total 
recall. What if he and his group 
were wrong in another minor detail? There might have been more 
than a gruesome jest in the Captain's remark about the second 
parachute not opening. 

Who would know if the drop 
ended in death? Might not the 
Directorate feel that so swift an 
end was only merciful? 

The first parachute opened with 
a jerk, and I began counting, 
slowly, in my head. 

At fifteen, I knew I was right. 
I was plunging down faster and 
faster through the thin air. Death 
was below me. 

At twenty, with a heaving jerk, 
the main parachute opened. The 
Captain's sense of humor had 
been even more gruesome than I 
imagined. 

Still, untrained as I was for this 
kind of thing, I hit the ground 
hard. Rolling over, I hit my head 
against something and I went out, 
thinking, just as I blanked, that 



I was getting tired of being unconscious. 

BEFORE my eyes opened 
again, I heard Larry's voice. 
I thought of it as a hallucination, 
but it was a remarkably persistent one. 

"Come on, Jake, you're all 
right now." 

I opened my eyes. It was Larry. 
Stranger yet, there were half a 
dozen people behind him. And 
two of them were women. 

"I was to have found you and 
taken you to a place up on the 
coast, for a cruiser to take us off," 
I told him miserably. "But the 
Directorate knows about it. The 
whole thing's a trap." 

Larry laughed. "It's a trap, 
sure enough, but the Directorate 
hasn't got it quite right." 

"I'm serious," I insisted. "They 
got it from me under total recall." 

"We knew that," Larry said. 
"Matthews couldn't warn you of 
it, of course, or the warning itself 
would have shown up. So there 
had to be another story — one that 
would convince you, and throw 
the Directorate off the scent at 
the same time." 

"How do you know all this?" 
"We haven't got a cruiser," 
Larry said. "We haven't even got 
a coracle. But we do have wireless communication. We were 
waiting for you. We always are 
waiting for misfits."

"We?" I asked. 

"We have a nice little colony 
here. Fifty-eight of us, and still 
growing." 

They had been helping me out 
of the dropsuit. I felt a breeze on 
my face, and the smell, the indescribable smell, of natural air 
laden with a dozen different 
scents of flowers and grass and 
trees. Larry was watching me. 

"It's really something, isn't it?" 

"What about the savages?" 

He shrugged. "There may be 
some to the west. We haven't had 
time to lopk properly. But this 
country's clear." 

There was soft turf beneath my 
feet. 

"But why?" I asked. "The Directorate must know what this 
planet is like. Why don't they* 
move back, instead of fumbling 
around with interstellar projects 
that never get anywhere?" 

"The Directorate is an organization designed to rule a set of 
neatly controlled artificial cities 
— a state spread out over nearly 
a dozen planets and satellites, but 
an entirely urban state. If men 
came back to Earth, came back 
to farm the land, living in villages as we do now, the Directorate's power would be broken. 
If you want any more reasons, 
you just don't know enough about 
human nature.'* 

"And can we beat them?" I 
asked him. "Can we defy them

under their very noses? With the 
Tycho telescope trained on the 
Earth, inspecting everything?" 

"We don't want to beat anybody," Larry said. "We're satisfied to escape notice. The village 
is made of small, scattered buildings, and even then they are camouflaged to make them harder to 
spot. We farm our land, and our 
agents on the planets pick our 
recruits." 

"Matthews," I exclaimed suddenly. "Poor devil,— he's still at 
Forbeston!" . 



"You'll see him shortly. He's 
due to be arrested within three 
months." 

He laughed and the rest of the 
small party with him. I saw the 
joke myself, and began laughing 
almost uncontrollably. Larry put 
an arm on my shoulder. 

"Take a look at that," he said. 
"Take a good look." 

I looked and saw the sunset. 
It was glowing through clean, 
pure air instead of a bubble or a 
viewport.
