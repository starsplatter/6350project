games By KATHERINE MacLEAN 


RONNY was playing by 
himself, which meant he 
was two tribes of Indians 
having a war. 

"Bang," he muttered, firing an 
imaginary rifle. He decided that 
it was a time in history before 
i he white people had sold the 
Indians any guns, and changed 
the rifle into a bow. "Wizz-. 
thunk," he substituted, mimicking from an Indian film on TV 
the graphic sound of an arrow 
striking flesh. 

"Oof." He folded down onto the 
t^rass, moaning, "Uhhhooh . . ."

and relaxing into defeat and 
death. 

"Want some chocolate milk, 
Ronny?" asked his mother's 
voice from the kitchen. 

"No, thanks," he called back, 
climbing to his feet to be another 
man. "Wizzthunk, wizzthunk," 
he added to the flights of arrows 
as the best archer in the tribe. 
"Last arrow. Wizzzz," he said, 
missing one enemy for realism. 
He addressed another battling 
brave. "Who has more arrows? 
They are coming too close. No 
time — I'll have to use my knife."

He drew the imaginary knife, 
ducking an arrow as it shot close. 

rriHEN he was the tribal chief 
standing somewhere else, and 
he saw that the warriors left 
alive were outnumbered. 

"We must retreat. We cannot 
leave our tribe without warriors 
to protect the women." 

Ronny decided that the chief 
was heroically wounded, his voice 
wavering from weakness. He had 
been propping himself against a 
tree to appear unharmed, but 
now he moved so that his braves 
could see he was pinned to the 
trunk by an arrow and could not 
walk. They cried out. 

He said, "Leave me and escape. 
But remember . . ." No words 
came, just the feeling of being 
what he was, a dying old eagle, 
a chief of warriors, speaking to 
young warriors who would need 
advice of seasoned humor and 
moderation to carry them through 
their young battles. He had to 
finish the sentence, tell them 
something wise. 

Ronny tried harder, pulling the 
feeling around him like a cloak 
of resignation and pride, leaning 
indifferently against the tree 
where the arrow had pinned him, 
hearing dimly in anticipation the 
sound of his aged voice conquering weakness to speak wisely of 
what they needed to be told. 
They had many battles ahead of 



them, and the battles would be 
against odds, with so many dead 
already. 

They must watch and wait, be 
flexible and tenacious, determined 
and persistent — but not too rash, 
subtle and indirect — not cowardly, and above all be patient with 
the triumph of the enemy and 
not maddened into suicidal direct attack. 

His stomach hurt with the arrow wound, and his braves waited to hear his words. He had to 
sum a part of his life's experience in words. Ronny tried harder , 
to build the scene realistically. 
Then suddenly it was real. He 
was the man. 

He was an old man, guide and 
adviser in an oblique battle 
against great odds. He was dying 
of something and his stomach j 
hurt with a knotted ache, like j 
hunger, and he was thirsty. He 
had refused to let the young men j 
make the sacrifice of trying to ! 
rescue him. He was hostage in 
the jail and dying, because he 
would not surrender to the enemy < 
nor cease ro fight them. He j 
smiled and said, "Remember to 1 
live like other men, but — remember to remember." 

And then he was saying things 
that could not be put into words, 
complex feelings that were ways 
of taking bad situations that 
made them easier to smile at, 
and then sentences that were not

entences, but single alphabet letters pushing each other " with 
igns, with a feeling of being coni iected like two halves of a swing, 
one side moving up when the 
other moved down, or like swings 
or like cogs and pendulums inside a clock, only without the 
i ogs, just with the push. 

It wasn't adding or multipication, and it used letters instead 
of numbers, but Ronny knew it 
was some kind of arithmetic. 

And he wasn't Ronny. 

He was an old man, teaching 
young men, and the old man did 
uot know about Ronny. He 
thought sadly how little he 
would be able to convey to the 
young men, and he remembered 
more, trying to sum long memories and much living into a few 
direct thoughts. And Ronny was 
the old man and himself, both at 
mce. 

TT was too intense. Part of 
Ronny wanted to escape and 
he alone, and that part withdrew 
and wanted to play something. 
Ronny sat in the grass and played with his toes like a much 
younger child. 

Part of Ronny that was Doctor Revert Purcell sat on the 
edge of a prison cot, concentrating on secret unpublished equations of biogenic stability which 
he wanted to pass on to the 
responsible hands of young re


searchers in the concealed-research chain. He was using the 
way of thinking which they had 
told him was the telepathic sending of ideas to anyone ready to 
receive. It was odd that he himself could never tell when he was 
sending. Probably a matter of 
age. They had started trying to 
teach him when he was already 
too old for anything so different. 

The water tap, four feet away, 
was dripping steadily, and it was 
hard for Purcell to concentrate, 
so intense was his thirst. He 
wondered if he could gather 
strength to walk that far. He was 
sitting up and that was good, but 
the struggle to raise himself that 
far had left him dizzy and trembling. If he tried to stand, the 
effort would surely interrupt his 
transmitting of equations and all 
the data he had not sent yet. 

Would the man with the keys ' 
who looked in the door twice a 
day care whether Purcell died 
with dignity? He was the only 
audience, and his expression 
never changed when Purcell asked him to point out to the authorities that he was not being 
given anything to eat. It was 
funny to Purcell to find that he 
wanted the respect of any audience to his dying, even of a man 
without response who treated 
him as if he were already a 
corpse. 

Perhaps the man would re

spond if Purcell said, "I have 
changed my mind. I will tell." 

But if he said that, he would 
lose his own respect. 

At the biochemists' and biophysicists' convention, the reporter had asked him if any, of 
his researches could be applied 
to warfare. 

He had answered with no feeling of danger, knowing that what 
he did was common practice 
among research men, sure that it 
was an unchallengeable right. 

"Some of them can, but those 
I keep to myself." 

The reporter remained deadpan. "For instance?" 

"Well, I have to choose something that won't reveal how ifs 
done now, but — ah — for example, 
a way of cheaply mass-producing 
specific antitoxins against any 
germ. It sounds harmless if you 
don't think* about it, but actually 
it would make germ warfare the 
most deadly and inexpensive 
weapon yet developed, for it 
would make it possible to prevent the backspread of contagion 
into a country's own troops, 
without much expense. There 
would be hell to pay if anyone 
ever let that out." Then he had 
added, trying to get the reporter 
to understand enough to change 
his cynical unimpressed expression, "You understand, germs 
are cheap — there would be a* new 
plague to spread everytime some 



pipsqueak biologist mutated a 
new germ. It isn't even expensive 
or difficult, as atom bombs are." 

The headline was: "Scientist 
Refuses to Give Secret of Weapon to Government." 

GOVERNMENT men came 
and asked him if this was 
correct, and on having it confirmed pointed out that he had 
an obligation. The research foundations where he had worked 
were subsidized by government 
money. He had been deferred 
from military service during his 
early years of study and work 
so he could become a scientist, 
instead of having to fight or die 
on the battlefield. 

"This might be so," he had 
said. "I am making an attempt to 
serve mankind by doing as much 
good and as little damage as pos 
sible. If you don't mind, I'd 
rather use my own judgment 
about what constitutes service." 

The statement seemed too 
blunt the minute he had said it, 
and he recognized that it had 
implications that his judgment 
was superior to that of the government. It probably was the 
most antagonizing thing that 
could have been said, but he 
could see no other possible statement, for it represented precisely 
what he thought. 

There were bigger headlines 
about that interview, and when

he stepped outside his building 
for lunch the next day, several 
small gangs of patriots arrived 
with the proclaimed purpose of 
pursuading him to tell. They 
fought each other for the privilege. 

The police had rescued him after he had lost several front teeth 
and had one eye badly gouged. 
They then left him to the care 
of the prison doctor in protective 
custody. Two days later, after 
having been questioned several 
times on his attitude toward revealing the parts of his research 
he had kept secret, he was transferred to a place that looked like 
a military jail, and left alone. He 
was not told what his status was. 

When someone came and asked 
him questions about his attitude, 
Purcell felt quite sure that what 
they were doing to him was illegal. He stated that he was going 
on a hunger strike until he was 
allowed to have visitors and see a 
lawyer. 

The next time the dinner hour 4 
arrived, they gave him nothing to 
eat. There had been no food in 
the cell since, and that was probably two weeks ago. He was not 
sure just how long, for during 
part of the second week his memory had become garbled. He dimly remembered "something that 
might have been delirium, which 
could have lasted more than one 
day. 



Perhaps the military who 
wanted the antitoxins for germ 
warfare were waiting quietly for 
him either to talk or die. 

T>ONNY got up from the grass 
and went into the kitchen, 
stumbling in his walk like a beginning toddler. 

"Choc -mil?" he said to his 
mother. 

She poured him some and 
teased gently, "What's the matter, Ronny — back to baby-talk?" 

He looked at her with big 
solemn eyes and drank slowly, 
not answering. 

In the cell somewhere distant. 
Dr. Purcell, famous biochemist, 
began waveringly trying fo rise j 
to his feet, unable to remember 
hunger as anything separate from 
him that could ever be ended, 
but weakly wanting a glass of 
water. Ronny could not feed him 
with the chocolate milk. Even 
though this was another himself, 
the body that was drinking was 
not the one that was thirsty. 

He wandered out into the back 
yard again, carrying the glass. 

"Bang," he said deceptively, 
pointing with his hand in case his -\ 
mother was looking. "Bang." i 
Everything had to seem usual; he 
was sure of that. This was too ■ 
big a thing, and too private, to 5 
tell a grownup. 

On the way back from the sink, 
Dr. Purcell slipped and fell and

 i 



lut his head against the edge of 
the iron cot. Ronny felt the edge 
Hashing through skin and into 
bane, and then a relaxing blanktiess inside his head, like falling 
^leep suddenly when they are 
Uing you a fairy story while 
vou want to stay awake to find 
out what happened next. 

"Bang," said Ronny vaguely, 
pointing at a tree. "Bang." He 
was ashamed because he had 
fallen down in the cell and hurt 
his head and become just Ronny 
;;ain before he had finished 
nding out his equations.- He 
ied to make believe he was alive 
gain, but it didn't work. 
You could never make-believe 
anything to a real good finish. 
They never ended neatly — there 
was always something unfinished, and something that would 
t;o right on after the end. 

It would have been nice if the 
i [tilers had come in and he had 
been able to say something noble 
i to them before dying, to show 
I that he was brave. 

"Bang," he said randomly, 
ointing his finger at his head, 
nd then jerked his hand away 
is if it had burned him. He had 
become the wrong person that 
time. The feel of a bullet jolting 
the side of his head was startling 
and unpleasant, even if not real, 
und the flash of someone's vindictive anger and self-pity while 
pulling a trigger . . , My wife 



will be sorry she ever . . . He 
didn't* like that kind of make-believe. It felt unsafe to do it without making up a story first. 

Ronny decided to be Indian 
braves again. They weren't very 
real, and when they were, they 
had simple straightforward emotions about courage and skill and 
pride and friendship that he 
would like. 

A MAN was leaning his arms 
on the fence, watching him. 
"Nice day." What's the matter, 
kid, are you an esper? 

"Hul-lo," Ronny stood on one 
foot and watched him. Just making believe. I only want to play. 
They make it too serious, having 
all these troubles. 

"Good countryside," The man 
gestured at the back yards, all 
opened in together with tangled 
bushes here and there to crouch 
behind, when other kids were 
there to play hide and seek, and 
with trees to climb. It can be the 
Universe if you pick and choose 
who to be, and don't let wrong 
choices make you shut off from 
it. You can make yourself learn 
from this if you are strong 
enough. Who have you been? 

Ronny stood on the other foot 
and scratched the back of his 
leg with his toes. He didn't want 
to remember. He always forgot 
right away, but this grownup 
was confident and young and

strong -looking, and meant something when he talked, not like 
most grownups. 

"I was playing Indian." J was 
an old chief, captured by enemies, trying to pass on to other 
warriors the wisdom of my life 
before I died. He made believe 
he^was the chief a little to show 
the young man what he was talking about. 

"Purcell!" The man drew in 
his breath between his teeth, and 
his face paled. He pulled back 
from reaching Ronny with his 
feelings, like holding his breath 
in. "Good game." You can learn 
from him. Don't leave him shut 
off, I beg you. You can let him 
influence you without being 
pulled off your own course. He 
was a good man. You were honored, and I envy the man you 
will be if you contacted him on 
resonant similarities. 

The grownup looked frightened. But you are too young. 
You'll block him out and lose 
him. Kids have to grow and learti 
at their own speed. 

Then he looked less afraid, but 
uncertain, and his thoughts struggled against each other. Their 
own speed. But there should be 
someone alive with PurcelFs 
pattern and memories. We loved 
him. Kids should grow at their 
own speed, but . . . How strong 
are you, Ronny? Can you move 
ahead of the normal growth pat


tern? 

Grownups always want you to 
do something. Ronny stared back, 
clenching his hands and moving 
his feet uneasily. 

The thoughts were open to him 
Do you want to be the old chit > 
again, Ronny? Be him often, so 
you can learn to know what he 
knew? {And feel as he felt. It 
would be a stiff dose tor a kid ) 
It will be rich and exciting, full of 
memories and skills. {But hard 
to chew. I'm doing this for Pur 
cell, Ronny, not for you. You 
have to make up your own mind ) 

"That was a good game. Aj e 
you going to play it any more?" 

HIS mother would not like it. 
She would feel the difference 
in him, as much as if he had; 
read one of the books she kept 
away from him, books that were 
supposed to be for adults only. 
The difference would hurt her. 
He was being bad, like eating 
between meals. But to know 
what grownups knew. . . 

He tightened his fists and; 
looked down at the grass. "I'll 
play it some more." 

The young man smiled, still 
pale and holding half his feelings 
back behind a dam. Then mesh 
with me a moment. Let me in. 

He was in with the thought, 
feeling Ronny's confused consent, reassuring him by not thinking or looking around inside while

ending out a single call, Purell, Doc, that found the combination key to Ronny's guarded 
yesterdays and last nights and 
lm minutes agos. Ronny, I'll set 
that door, PurcelVs memories, 
open tor you. You can't close it, 
hut teel like this about it — and 
lie planted in a strong set, quest toning, coot, open, a feeling of 
absorbing without words . . . it 
will give information when you 
need it, like a dictionary. 

The grownup straightened 
.iway from tke fence, preparing 
to walk off. Behind a dam 
pressed grief and anger for the 
leath of the man he called Purell. 

"And any time you want to be 
t he old chief, at any age he lived, 
rust make believe you are him." 

Grief and anger pressed more 
strongly against the dam, and 
the man turned and left rapidly, 
letting his thoughts flicker and 
scatter through private memories 
that Ronny did not share, that 
no one shared, breaking thought 
contact with everyone so that the 



man could be alone in his own 
mind to have his feelings in private. 

¥>ONNY picked up the empty 
glass that had held his 
chocolate milk from the back 
steps where he had left it and 
went inside. As he stepped into 
the kitchen, he knew what another kitchen had looked like for 
a five-year-old child who had 
been Purcell ninety years ago. 
There had been an iron sink, and 
a brown- and -green-spotted faucet, and the glass had been 
heavier and transparent, like 
real glass. 

Ronny reached up and put the 
colored plastic tumbler down. 

"That was a nice young man, 
dear. What did he say to you?" 

Ronny looked up at his mamma, comparing her with the 
remembered mamma of fifty 
years ago. He loved the other 
one, too. 

"He tol* me he's glad I play 
Indian."
