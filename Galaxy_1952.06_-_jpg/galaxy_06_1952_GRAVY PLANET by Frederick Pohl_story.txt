CRAVY PLANET by Frederick Pohl



AS I dressed that morning, 
I ran over in my mind 
/ m the long list of statistics, 
evasions and exaggerations that 
they would expect in my report. 
My section — Production — had 
been plagued with a long series 
of illnesses and resignations, and 
you can't get work done without 
people to do it. But the Board 
wasn't likely to take that as an 
excuse. 

I rubbed the depilatory soap 
.over my face and rinsed it with 
the trickle from the fresh-water 
tap. Wasteful, of course, but I 
could afford the cost, and salt 
water always leaves my face 
itchy. Before the last of the stubble was washed away, the trickle 
stopped and didn't start again. I 
swore a little and finished rinsing 
with salt. It had been happening 
lately; some people blamed Connie saboteurs. Loyalty raids were 
being held throughout the New 
York Water Supply Corporation, 
but so far they hadn't changed 
the damned water situation. Very 
annoying, considering the price 
of fresh water — you'd think the 
company would protect its customers. 

The morning newscast over the 
shaving mirror caught me for a 
moment . . . the President's lastnight speech, a brief glimpse of 
the Venus rocket, squat and silvery on the Arizona sand, rioting 
in Panama ... I switched it off 

I 



when the quarter-hour time signal chimed over the audio band. 

It looked as though I was going 
to be late again, which certainly 
would not help mollify the Board. 

I saved five minutes by wearing yesterday's shirt and by leaving my breakfast juice to grow 
warm and sticky on the table. 
But I lost the five minutes by 
trying to call Kathy. She didn't 
answer the phone. "And I was 
late getting into the office. 

FORTUNATELY — and unprecedented! y — Fowler 
Schocken was late too. 

In our office it was Fowler's 
custom to hold Board conferences 
fifteen minutes before the regular 
opening of the business day. It 
kept the clerks and stenos on 
their toes, and it was no hardship 
to Fowler. He spent every morning in the office anyway: "morning" to him began with the rising 
of the Sun. 

Today, though, I had time to 
get my secretary's summary off 
my desk before the meeting. 
When Fowler Schocken walked 
in with a courteous apology for 
his tardiness, I was sitting in my 
place at the foot of the table, 
reasonably relaxed and as sure 
of myself as a Fowler Schocken 
Associate was ever likely to be. 

"Good morai«g," Fowler said 
and the eleven of us made the 
proper murmur. He didn't sit 



down; he stood gazing fondly as 
a father at us for about a minute 
and a half. Then he looked carefully and delightedly about the 
room. 

"I've been thinking about our 
conference room," he said, and 
we all looked around at it. The 
room wasn't big, it wasn't small: 
say ten by twelve. But it was cool, 
well-lighted and most imposingly 
furnished. The air recirculators 
were cleverly hidden behind animated friezes; the carpeting was 
thick and soft; and every piece 
of furniture was constructed from 
top to bottom of authentic, expertized, genuine tree-grown 
wood. 

Fowler Schocken said : "We 
have a nice conference room here, 
men, as we should have — Fowler 
Schocken Associates is the largest 
advertising agency in the city. 
We bill a megabuck a year more 
than anybody else around. And 
— " he looked around at all of 
us — "I think you'll agree that 
we all find it worth while. I don't 
believe there's a person in this 
room who has less than a tworoom apartment." He twinkled at 
me. "Even the bachelors. Speaking for myself, I've done well. 
My summer place looks right 
over one of the largest paries on 
Long Island. I haven't tasted any 
protein but new rrfleat for years 
and when I go out for a spin I 
pedal a Cadillac. The wolf is a

long way from my door. And I 
think any one of you can say the 
same. Right?" The hand of our 
Director of Market Research shot 
up and Fowler nodded at him: 
"Yes, Matthew?" 

Matt Runstead knew which 
side his bread was oiled on. He 
glared belligerently around the 
table. "I just want to go on record as agreeing with Mr. 
Schocken one hundred per cent 
— all the way!" 

"Thank you, Matthew." It took 
Fowler Schocken a moment before he could go on. "Well, we 
all know what put us where wc 
are. We remember the Starrzelius 
Verily account, and how we put 
Indiastries on the map. The first 
spherical trust. Merging a whole 
subcontinent into a single manufacturing complex. Schocken Associates pioneered on both of 
them. Nobody can say we were 
floating with the tide. But that's 
behind us. 

"Men, I want to know something. You can tell me truthfully 
— are we getting soft?" He took 
time to look at ench of our faces 
searchingly, ignoring the forest 
of hands in the air. Mine was 
right up there, too. Then he 
waved to the man at his right. 
"You first, Ben." 

Ben Winston stood up and 
baritoned: "Speaking for Industrial Anthropology, no! Listen to 
today's progress report — you'll 



get it in the noon bulletin, but 
let me brief you now. According 
to the midnight indices, all primary schools east of the Mississippi are now using our 
packaging recommendation for 
the school lunch program. Soyaburgers and generated steak are 
shrewdly packed in containers 
the same shade of green as the 
Universal products, to transfer 
unconsciously the distaste to our 
competition. But the candy, ice 
cream and kiddiebutt cigarette 
ration are wrapped in colorful 
Starrzelius red. When those little 
consumers grow up . . ." He lifted 
his eyes exultantly from his notes. 
"According to our extrapolation, 
fifteen years from now Universal 
products will be bankrupt and off 
the market entirely!" 

He sat down in a wave of applause. Schocken clapped, too, 
and looked brightly at the rest of 
us. I leaned forward with Expression One — eagerness, intelligence, competence — all over my 
face. But I needn't have bothered. 
Fowler pointed to the lean man 
next to Winston. Harvey Bruner. 

"I don't have to tell you men 
that Point-of-Sale has its special 
problems," Harvey said, puffing 
his thin cheeks. "1 swear, the 
whole damned government must 
be infiltrated with Connies!" He 
was beginning to get hysterical. 
"You know what they've done. 
They outlawed compulsive sub

sonics in our auditory captiveaudience advertising — but we've 
bounced back with a list of semantic cue words that tie in with 
every basic trauma and neurosis 
in American life today. They 
listened to the safety cranks and 
stopped us from projecting our 
messages on aircar windows, but 
Lab tells me—" he nodded to our 
Director of Research across the 
table— "that soon we'll be testing 
a system that projects direct on 
the retina of the eye. 

"But we're not content with 
that. We're going forward. As an 
example I want to mention the 
Coffiest pro — " He broke off. "Excuse me, Mr. Schocken," he 
whispered. "Has Security checked 
this room?'* ** 

Fowler Schocken nodded. "Absolutely clean. Nothing but the 
usual State Department and 
House of Representatives spymikes. And of course we're feeding a canned playback into 
them." 

Harvey relaxed again. "Well, 
about this Coffiest." he said. 
"We're sampling it in fifteen key 
cities. It's the usual offer — a thirteen-week supply of Coffiest, ten 
thousand dollars in cash and a 
weekend vacation on the Ligurian 
Riviera to everybody who comes 
in. But — and here's what makes 
this campaign truly great, in my 
estimation — each sample of Coffiest contains three milligrams of a 



simple alkaloid. Nothing harmful, but definitely habit-forming. 
After ten weeks the customer is 
hooked for life. It would cost him 
at least fifty thousand dollars for 
a cure, so it's simpler for him to 
go right on drinking Cofliest — 
three cups with every meal and 
a pot beside his bed at night, just 
as it says on the jar." 

Fowler Schocken beamed and 
I braced myself into Expression 
One again. Next to Harvey sat 
Tildy Mathis, Chief of Personnel 
and hand-picked by Schocken 
himself. He didn't ask women to 
speak at Board sessions, and next 
to Tildy sat me. But Fowler 
let me down with a smile. 

He said : "I won't ask every 
section to report. We haven't the 
time. But you've given me your 
answer, gentlemen, It's the answer I like. You've met every 
challenge up to now. I wnnt to 
give you a new challenge." 

He pressed a button on his 
monitor panel and swiveled his 
chair around. The lights went 
down in the room ; the projected 
art calendar (executives only) 
that hung behind Schocken's 
chair faded and revealed the mottled surface of the screen. On it 
another picture began to form. 

T HAD seen that picture once 
■P- before, that same day, in the 
news screen over my shaving 
mirror. 




 



It was the Venus rocket, 
a thousand-foot monster, the 
bloated child of the slim V-2s 
and stubby Moon rockets of the 
past. Around it was a scaffolding 
of steel and aluminum, a-crawl 
with tiny figures that manipulated minute, blue-white welding 
flames. The picture was obviously 
recorded ; it showed the rocket 
as it had been weeks or months 
ago in an earlier stage of construction, not poised as if ready 
for takeoff, the way I had seen 
it earlier. 

A voice from the screen said 
triumphantly and inaccurately: 
"This is the ship that spans the 
stars!'* I recognized the voice as 
belonging to one of the organtoned commentators in Aural Effects and expertized the script 
without effort as emanating from 
one of Tildy's girl copywriters. 
The talented slovenliness that 
would confuse Venus with a star 
had to come from somebody on 
her staff. 

"This is the ship that a modern Columbus will drive through 
the void," said the voice. "Six 
and a half million tons of trapped 
lightning and steel — an ark for 
eighteen hundred men and 
women, and everything to make 
a new world for their home. Who 
will be in it? What fortunate pioneers will tear an empire from 
the rich, fresh soil of another 
world? 



"Let me introduce you to them 
—a man and his wife, two of the 
intrepid . . 

The voice kept going. On the 
screen, the picture dissolved to a 
spacious suburban roomette in 
early morning — the husband 
folding the bed into the wall and 
taking down the partition to the 
children's nook; the wife dialing 
breakfast and erecting the tr.ble. 
Over the breakfast juices and the 
children's pablum (with a steaming mug of Coftiest for each, of 
course) they spoke persuasively 
to each other about how wise and 
brave they had been to apply for 
passage in the Venus rocket. And 
the closing question of their 
youngest babbler ("Mommy, 
when I grow up kin I take my 
boys and girls to a place as nice 
as Venus?") cued the switch to 
a highly imaginative serits of 
shots of Venus as it would be 
when the child grew up — verdant 
valleys, crystal lakes, brilliant 
mountain vistas. 

THE commentary did not 
deny, and neither did it 
dwell on, the decades of hydroponics and life in hermetically 
sealed cabins that the pioneers 
would have to endure while working on Venus's unbreathable 
atmosphere and waterless chemistry. 

Instinctively I had set the 
timer button on my watch as the 



GRAVY PLANIT 



f 



picture started. When it was over, 
I read the dial: nine minutes, 
three times as long as any commercial could legally run! 

1 1 was only after the lights 
were on again, the cigarettes lit 
and Fowler Schocken well into 
his pep talk for the day that I 
saw the answer. He called our 
attention to the history of advertising — from the simple handmaiden task of selling already 
manufactured goods to its present role of creating industries and 
redesigning a world's folkways to 
meet the needs of. commerce. He 
touched once more on what we 
ourselves, Fowler Schocken Associates, had done with our own 
expansive career. And then he 
said: 

"There's an old saying, men, 
'The world is our oyster.' We've 
made it come true. But we've 
eaten that oyster. We've actually 
and literally conquered the world. 
Like Napoleon, we weep for new 
worlds to conquer. And there — " 
he waved at the screen behind 
him — "you have just seen the 
first of those worlds." 

I have never liked Matt Runstead, as you may have gathered. 
He is a Paul Pry whom I suspect 
of wiretapping even within the 
company. He must have spied 
out the Venus project well in advance, because not even the most 
talented reflexes could have 
brought out his little speech. 



While the rest of us were still 
busy assimilating what Fowler 
Schocken had told us, Runstead 
was leaping to his feet. 

"Gentlemen," he said with passion, "this is truly the work of 
genius. Not just India, not just 
a commodity, but a whole planet 
to sell ! I salute you, Fowler 
Schocken — the Clive, the Bolivar, 
the John Jacob Astor of a new 
world!" 

Matt was first, as I say, but 
every one of us got up and said 
in turn about the same thing. Including me. Kathy had never understood it and I'd tried to 
explain that it was a religious 
ritual — like the champagne bottle at a ship's launching, or the 
sacrifice of the virgin to the corn 
crop. I don't think any of us, 
except maybe Matt Runstead, 
would feed habit-forming narcotics to the world for money 
alone. There was a high ideal behind it — production for use and 
profit. With our enormously advanced technology, we could produce more coffee, to mention just 
one item out of the innumerable 
roster of foods and goods and 
services, than the world could 
normally consume. Our sacred 
task was to keep the demand 
right in step with the supply — 
not an easy one if you consider 
the flood of things produced on 
farms and in factories. 

But we did it! By Morgan, we 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



did it and we were proud to be 
able to! 

WHEN all of us had done, 
Fowler Schocken touched 
another button and showed us a 
chart. 

He explained it carefully item 
by item. He showed us tables and 
graphs and diagrams of the entire new Department of Fowler 
Schocken Associates which would 
be set up to handle the development and exploitation of the 
pi a net Venus. He cove red the 
tedious lobbying and friendmaking in Congress which had 
given us the exclusive right to build up and profit from the 
planet, and I began to see how 
he could safely use a nine-minute 
commercial. He explained how 
the Government naturally wanted 
Venus to be an American planet 
and how they had invoked our 
American supremacy in advertising to make it possible. 

As he spoke, we all caught 
some of his fire. I envied the man 
who would head the Venus Section; any one of us would have 
committed even a commercial offense to get the job. 

He spoke of trouble lining up 
the Senator from DuPont Chemicals with his 45 votes, and of an 
easy triumph over the Senator 
from Nash-Kelvinator with his 
six. He spoke proudly of a faked 
Connie demonstration against 



Fowler Schocken which had lined 
up the anti-Connie Secretary of 
the Interior. 

Visual Aids had done a beautiful job of briefing the information, but we were there nearly 
an hour looking at the charts and 
listening to Fowler's achievements and plans. 

But finally he clicked off the 
projector and said: "There you 
have it. That's our new campaign. And it starts right away 
— now. I have only one more announcement to make and then 
we can all get to work." 

Fowler Schocken is a good 
showman. He took the time to 
find a slip of paper and read from 
it a sentence that the lowest of 
our copyboys could deliver off 
the cuff. "The chairman of the 
Venus Section," he read, "will be 
Mitchell Courtenay." 

And that was the biggest surprise of all, because Mitchell 
Courtenay, five feet eleven inches 
tall, sandy -haired, modc-rntcly 
good-looking except for a nose 
that was pushed a little off center 
—is me. 

II 

I LINGERED with Fowler for 
three or four minutes while 
the rest of the Board went back 
to their offices, and the elevator 
ride down from the Board room 
to my own office on the cighty

XX 



sixth floor took a few seconds, 
so Hester was already clearing 
out my desk when I arrived. 

"Congratulations, Mr. Courtenay," she said. "You're moving 
to the eighty-ninth now. Isn't it 
wonderful? And I'll have a private office, too!" 

I thanked her and picked up 
the phone over the desk, staying 
out of her way. The first thing I 
had to do was get my staff in and 
turn over the reins of Production; 
Tom Gillespie was next in line. 
But the first thing I did do was 
to dial Kathy's apartment again. 
There was still no answer, so I 
called in the boys. 

They were properly sorry to 
see me go and properly delighted 
about everybody moving up a 
notch. 

And then it was lunch time, so 
I postponed the problem of the 
planet Venus until the afternoon. 

X made a phone call, ate 
quickly in the company cafeteria, 
took the elevator down to the 
shuttle and the shuttle south for 
sixteen blocks. Coming out. I 
found myself in the open air for 
the first time that day and 
reached for my anti-soot plugs, 
but didn't put them in. The light 
rain had temporarily washed the 
air clean. It was summer, hot and 
sticky ; the hordes of people 
crowding the sidewalks were as 
anxious as I to get back inside 
a building. I had to bulldoze my 



way across the street and into 
the lobby. 

The elevator took me up fourteen floors. It was an old building 
with imperfect air conditioning; 
I felt a chill in my damp suit. 
It occurred to me to use that instead of the story I had prepared, 
but I decided against it. 

A girl in a starched white uniform looked up as I walked into 
the office. I said: "My name is 
Silver. Walter P. Silver. I have 
an appointment." 

"Yes. Mr. Silver," she remembered. "Your heart. You said it 
was an emergency." 

"That's right. It's probably 
psychosomatic, but I felt — " 

"Of course." She waved me to 
a chair. "Dr. Nevin will see you 
in just a moment." 

It was ten minutes. A young 
woman came out of the doctor's 
office and a man who had been, 
waiting in the reception room before me went in; then he came 
out and the nurse said to me: 
"Will you go into Dr. Nevin's 
office now?" 

I went in. Kathy. very trim 
and handsome in her doctor's 
smock, was putting a case chart 
in her desk. When she straightened up, she said, "Oh, Mitch!" 
in a very annoyed tone. 

"I told only one lie," I said. "I 
gave the girl a phony name. But 
it is an emergency. And my heart 
is involved." 



la 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



There was a faint impulse toward a smile, but it didn't quite 
reach the surface. "Not medically," she said. 

"I told her it was probably psychosomatic. She said to come in 
anyhow." 

"I'll speak to her about that. 
Mitch, you know I can't see you 
during working hours. Now 
please — " 

I sat down next to her desk. 
"You won't see me any time, 
Kathy. What's the trouble?" 

"Nothing's the trouble. Please 
go away, Mitch. I'm a doctor; I 
have work to do." 

"Nothing as important as this. 
Kathy, I tried to call you all last 
night and all this morning." 

She struck a cigarette without 
looking at me. "I wasn't home." 

"No, you weren't. I don't suppose I have the right to ask my 
own wife where she spends her 
time, do I?" 

"Damn it, Mitch, you know — " 
Her phone rang. She screwed her 
eyes shut for a moment. Then she 
picked up the phone, leaning 
back in her chair, looking across 
the room, relaxed, a doctor soothing a patient. It took only a few 
moments. But when it was all 
over, she was entirely self-possessed. 

"Please go away," she said, 
stubbing out her cigarette. 

"Not until you tell me when 
you'll see me." 



"I . . . haven't time to see you. 
I'm not your wife. You have no 
right to bother me like this. I 
could have you enjoined or arrested." 

"My certificate's on file," I reminded her. 

"Mine isn't. It never will be. As 
soon as the year is up, we're 
through, Mitch." 

"There was something I wanted to tell you." Kathy had always been reachable through 
curiosity. 

Instead of saying again, 
"Please go away," she said. "Well, 
what is it?" 

"It's something big. It calls for 
a celebration. And I'm not above 
using it as an excuse to see you 
for just a little while tonight. 
Please. Kathy — I love you very 
much and I promise not to make 
a scene." 

"Well — " While she was thinking, her phone rang. "All right," 
she said. "Call me at home. Seven 
o'clock. Now let me take care of 
the sick people." 

She picked up the phone. I let 
myself out of her office while she 
was talking, and she didn't look 
after me. 

FOWLER SCHOCKEN was 
hunched over his desk as I 
walked in. He was staring at the 
latest issue of Taunton's Weekly. 
The magazine was blinking in 
full color as the triggered mole

cults of its inks collected photons 
by driblets and released them in 
bursts. He waved the brilliant 
pages at me and asked: "What 
do you think of this, Mitch?" 

"Sleazy advertising," I said 
promptly. "If we had to stoop 
so low as to sponsor a magazine 
like Taunton Associates, I think 
I'd resign. It's too cheap a trick." 

He put the magazine face 
down; the flashing inks gave one 
last burst and subsided as their 
light source was cut off. 

"Yes, it's cheap," he said 
thoughtfully. "But you have to 
give them credit for enterprise. 
Taunton gets sixteen and a half 
million readers for his ads every 
week. Nobody else's — just Taunton clients. And I hope you didn't 
mean that literally about resigning. I just gave Harvey the goahead on Schock. The first issue 
comes out in the fall, with a print 
order of twenty million." 

He mercifully held up his hand 
to cut off my stammering try at 
an explanation. "I understood 
what you meant, Mitch. You 
were against cheap advertising. 
So am I. Taunton is to me the 
epitome of everything that keeps 
advertising from finding its rightful place with the clergy, medicine and the bar in our way of 
life. There isn't a shoddy trick he 
wouldn't pull, from bribing a 
judge to stealing away an employee. And, Mitch, he's a man 



you'll have to watch." 

"Why? I mean, why particularly?" 

Schocken chuckled. "Because 
we stole Ven us from him. It 
wasn't easy to persuade the Government that it should be our 
baby." 

"I see," I said, and I did. Our 
representative government now is 
more representative than it has 
ever been before in history. It is 
not. of course, representative per 
capita, but it most surely is ad 
valorem, which is the only realistic way to govern a country. A 
citizen's vote must be weighed in 
the same way as a member of a 
family exerts influence — according to his wisdom and success. 
His power, in other words. Just 
as the head of a family makes its 
decisions because he bears the 
most responsibility and the ability to enforce his decisions, a 
nation must, obviously, be governed by its leaders. This has always been true in fact. Ours is 
the first civilization, however, 
which admits the reality of the 
situation and applies the correct 
solution with admirably logical 
practicality. 

One thing was bothering me. 
"Won't Taunton be likely to take 
— well, direct action?" 

"Oh. he'll try to steal it back,"* 
Fowler said mildly. 

"That's not what I mean. You 
remember what happened with 



14 




 



Antarctic Exploitation." 

"I was there. A hundred and 
forty casualities on our side. God 
knows what they lost." 

"And that was only one continent. Taunton takes these things 
pretty personally; If he filed a 
feud over that, won't he do it 
for a whole planet?" 

Fowler said patiently, "No, 
Mitch. He wouldn't dare. In the 
first place, industrial feuds are 
expensive. Preliminary hearings 
alone can tie up the whole legal 
staff for weeks, when we get 
through with our injunctions and 
counter-claims. In the second 
place, he doesn't have grounds — 
this is a legal, perfectly openand-aboveboard assignment by 
the Incorporated Government of 
the United States of America ; he 
can't question it. In the third 
place, we'd whip his tail off." 

"I guess you're right," I admitted. It was just as well, as far 
as I'm concerned. Believe me, I'm 
a loyal employee of Fowler 
Shocken Associates; ever since 
cadet days I have tried to live my 
life "for Company and for Sales." 
But industrial feuds can be pretty 
messy. Our profession has been 
comparatively free of them — 
reasonable men can talk these 
things out nine times out of ten. 
But it was only a few decades 
ago, back in 2039, that a small 
but highly effective advertising 
agency in London filed a feud 



against one of our bigger competitors, wiping out every executive 
on the. staff. And they say there 
are still bloodstains on the steps 
of the General Post Office where 
two delivery companies had 
fought it out for the Federal 
Postal Contract, which, like the 
Armed Services, national and 
local police forces and other 
former government agencies, are 
let to private enterprise as they 
should be. 

Schocken was speaking again; 
my attention whipped back. 
"There's one thing you'll have to 
watch for," he cautioned. "This 
is the kind of project that is 
bound to bring out the lunatic 
fringe. Every crackpot organization on the list, from the Connies 
themselves on down, is going to 
come out for or agin it. I don't 
care how you do it, but make sure 
they're all for. Butter them up. 
We don't want them to contend 
with as well as Taunton." 

"Even the Connies?" I asked, 
astonished. 

"Oh, no, Mitch. Don't bother 
with them; they're so discredited 
that they'd be more of a liability." His white hair glinted in the 
lamplight as he bobbed his head. 
"Maybe you could spread the 
word that space -travel is violently opposed to the principles 
of Conservationism. Uses up too 
many raw materials, hurts the 
general living standard — you 



GRAVY PLAN 61 



15 



know, the usual unrealistic line. 
Bring in the fact that rocket fuel 
uses organic material that the 
Connies think should be made 
into fertilizer . . 

I like to watch an expert at 
work. Fowler Schocken laid down 
a whole sub-campaign for me 
right there; I took it down and 
filled in the details. The Conservationists were fair game, those 
wild-eyed zealots who pretended 
that modern scientific method 
was not competent to meet with 
the demands of our expanding 
population and dwindling resources. I had been exposed to 
Connie sentiment in my time, and 
the arguments had always come 
down to one thing: Nature's way 
of living was the right way of 
living. If "Nature" had intended 
us to eat fresh vegetables, it 
wouldn't have given us niacin or 
thiamin chloride. 

I sat still for twenty minutes 
more of Fowler Schocken's inspirational talk, and came away 
with the discovery that I had 
often made before: briefly and 
effectively, he had given me every 
fact and instruction I needed. 
The details he left to me; but I 
knew my job. 

The government wanted Venus 
colonized by Americans. To accomplish this, three things were 
needed: colonists; a way of getting them to Venus: and something for them to do when they 

U 



got there in one piece. 

The first was direct advertising. Schocken's TV commercial 
had blueprinted that, and it 
would be easy. It is always easy 
to persuade men and women — 
particularly American men and 
women who have pioneer blood 
in their veins — that the grass is 
greener far away. I had already 
penciled in a tentative campaign 
with the budget well under a 
megabuck. More would have 
been extravagant. 

The second was only partly our 
problem. The ships had been designed — by Republic Aviation, 
Bell Telephone Labs and U. S. 
Steel, I believe, under Defense 
Corporation contract. Our job 
wasn't to make the transportation to Venus possible, but to 
make it palatable. When your 
wife found her burned-out toaster impossible to replace because 
its nichrome element was part of 
a Venus rocket's main drive jet, 
or when the inevitable disgruntled Congressman for a small and 
frozen-out firm waved an appropriations sheet around his head 
and talked about government 
waste on wildcat schemes, our 
job began: We had to convince 
your wife that rockets are more 
important than toasters; we had 
to convince the Congressman's 
constituent firm that its tactics 
were unpopular and would cost it 
profits. 


 



I thought briefly of an austerity 
campaign and vetoed it. Our 
other accounts would suffer. But 
I needed something that would 
offer vicarious gratification to the 
eight hundred million who would 
not ride the rockets themselves. 

1 tabled that ; Bruner could 
help me there. And I went on 
to point three. There had to be 
something to keep the colonists 
busy on Venus. 

This, I knew, was what Fowler 
Schocken had his eye on. The 
government money that would 
pay for the basic campaign was 
u nice addition to our year's billing, but Fowler Schocken was too 
big for pne-shot accounts. What 
we wanted was the year-afteryear reliability of a major industrial account. 

Fowler, ef course, hoped to 
repeat on an enormously magnified scale our smashing success 
with Indiastries. His boards and 
he had organized all of India into 
a single giant cartel, with every 
last woven basket and iridium ingot it produced sold through 
Fowler Schocken advertising. 
Now he could do the same with 
Venus. Potentially, it was worth 
as much as every dollar of value 
in existence put together! A whole 
new planet, almost the size of 
Earth, in prospect as rich as 
Earth — and every micron, every 
milligram of it ours. 

I looked at my watch. After 



four; my date with Kathy was 
for seven. I just had barely time. 
I dialed Hester and had her get 
me space on the Washington jet 
while I put through a call to the 
name Fowler had given me. The 
name was Jack O'Shea; he was 
the only human being who had 
been to Venus — so far. His voice 
was young and cocky as he made 
an appointment to see me. 

WE were five extra minutes in 
the landing pattern over 
Washington and then there was 
a hassel at the ramp. Brinks Express guards were swarming 
around our plane and their lieutenant demanded identification 
from each emerging passenger. 
When it was my turn, I asked 
what was going on. He looked 
at my low-number Social Security card thoughtfully and then 
saluted. 

"Sorry to bother you, Mr. 
Courtenay," he apologized. "It's 
the Connie bombing near Topeka. We got a tip that the man 
might be aboard the 4:05 New 
York jet. Seems to have been a 
lemon." 

"What Connie bombing was 
this?" 

"DuPont Raw Materials Division — we're under contract for 
their plant protection, you know 
—was opening up a new coal vein 
under some eorhland they own 
out there. They made a nice little

ceremony ©f it, and just as the 
hydraulic mining machine started 
ramming through the topsoil, 
somebody tossed a bomb from 
the crowd. Killed the machine 
operator, his helper and a vice 
president. He slipped away in 
the «:owd, but he was identified. 
We'll get him one of these days." 

"Good luck, Lieutenant," I 
said, and hurried on to the refreshment lounge. 

O'Shea was waiting at a window seat, visibly annoyed, but he 
grinned when 1 apologized. 

"It eould happen to anybody," 
he said, and shrilled at a waiter. 
When we had placed our orders, 
he leaned back and said: "Well?" 

I looked down at him across 
the table and looked away 
through the window. Off to the 
south, the gigantic pylon of the 
Hearst Memorial blinked its 
marker signal ; behind it lay the 
tiny, dulled dome of the old Capitol. I, an ad man, was embarrassed, and O'Shea was enjoying it. 

"Well?" he asked again, quite 
amusedly, and I knew he meant: 
"Now all of you have to come to 
me, and how do you like it for a 
change?" 

I plunged. "I came for information," I said. "For instance: 
what's on Venus?" 

"Sand and smoke," he said 
promptly. "Didn't you read my 
report?" 



"Certainly. I want to know 
more." 

"Everything's in the reptoftt 
Jesus, they kept me in the interrogation room for three solid 
days when I got back! If I left 
anything out, it's gone permanently." 

"That's not what I mean, Jack. 
Who wants to spend his life reading reports? I have fifteen men in 
Research doing nothing but digesting reports for me so I don't 
have to read them. I want to get 
the feel of the planet. There's 
only one place I can get it — because only one man's been there.** 

"And sometimes I wish I had 
not," O'Shea said wearily. "Well, 
where do I start? You know why 
they picked me — the only midget 
in the world with a pilot's license. 
And you know all about the ship. 
And you saw the assay reports on 
the samples 1 brought back. Not 
that they mean much. 1 only 
touched down once and five miles 
away the geology might be entirely different." 

"I know all that. Look, Jack, 
put it this way. Suppose you 
wanted a lot of people to go to 
Venus. What would you tell them 
about it?" 

He laughed. "I'd tell them a 
lot of damn big lies. Start from 
scratch, won't you? What's the 
deal?" 

I gave him a fill-in on what 
Schocken Associates was up to, 



18 




 



while his round little face stared 
at me through his round little 
eyes. There is an opaque quality, 
like porcelain, to the features of 
a midget: as though the destiny 
that had made them small at 
the same time made them more 
perfect and polished than ordinary men, as if to show that 
their lack of size did not mean 
lack of completion. He sipped his 
drink and I gulped mine between paragraphs. 

When my pitch was finished, I 
still didn't know whether he was 
on my side or not. Fowler had 
helped him to capitalize on his 
fame via testimonials, books and 
lectures, so he owed us a little 
gratitude and no more. 

He said: "I wish I could help,** 
and that made things easier. 

"You can/* I told him. "That's 
what I'm here for. Tell me what 
Venus has to offer." » 

"Damn little." A small frown 
chiseled across his lacquer forehead. "Where shall I start? Do 1 
have to tell you about the atmosphere? There's free formaldehyde, you know — embalming 
fluid. Or the heat? It averages 
above the boiling-point of water 
■ — if there was any water on 
Venus, which there isn't. Not accessible, anyhow. Or the winds. I 
clocked five hundred miles an 
hour.** 

"Honestly, Jack, there are answers for all those things. I want 



to get what you thought when 
you were there, how you reacted. 
Just start talking. I'll tell you 
when I've had what I wanted." 

He dented his rose-marble lip 
with his lower teeth. "Well, let's 
start at the beginning. Get us 
another drink, won't you?" 

The waiter took our order and 
came back with the liquor. Jack 
drummed on the table, sipped 
his rhine wine and seltzer, and 
began to talk. 

He started way back, which 
was good. I wanted to know the 
elusive, subjective mood that 
underlay his technical reports on 
the planet Venus, the basic feeling that would put compulsion 
and conviction into the project. 

He told me about his father, 
the six-foot chemical engineer, 
and his mother, the plump, strapping housewife. He made me feel 
their dismay and their ungrudging love for their thirty-five-inch 
son. He had been eleven years 
old when the subject of his adult 
life and work first came up. He 
remembered the unhappiness on 
their faces at his first, inevitable, 
off-hand suggestion about the 
circus. It was no minor tribute 
to them that the subject never 
came up again. It was a major 
tribute that Jack's settled desire 
to learn enough engineering and 
rocketry to be a test pilot had 
been granted, paid for and carried out in the face of every ob

stacle of ridicule and refusal from 
the schools. 

Of course Venus had made it 
all pay off. 

The Venus rocket designers ran 
into one major complication. It 
had been easy enough to get a 
rocket to the Moon, a quartermillion miles away; theoretically, 
it was not much harder to blast 
one across space to the nearest 
other world, Venus. The question 
was one of orbits and time, of 
controlling the ship and bringing 
it back again. 

They could blast the ship to 
Venus in days — at so squandersome a fuel expenditure that ten 
ships couldn't carry enough. Or 
they could ease it to Venus along 
its natural orbits as you might 
float a barge down a gentle river 
— which saved fuel, but lengthened the trip to months. A man 
in that length of time eats twice 
his own weight in food, breathes 
nine times his weight of air and 
drinks water enough to float a 
yawl. Closing the eyefe with 
waste products is the answer, of 
course — only the equipment 
weighs more than the food, air 
and water. So the human pilot 
was out. 

A team of designers went to 
work on an automatic pilot. 
When it was done it worked 
pretty well, and weighed four 
and one -half tons in spite of 
printed circuits and relays con


structed under a microscope. The 
project stopped right there until 
somebody thought of that most 
perfect servo-mechanism: a sixty 
pound midget. A third of a man 
in weight. Jack O'Shea ate a third 
of the food, breathed a third of 
the oxygen. With minimumweight, low -efficiency water- and 
air-purifiers. Jack came in just 
under the limit and thereby won 
himself undying fame. 

He said broodingly, a little 
drunk from the impact of two 
weak drinks on his small frame: 
"They put me into the rocket 
like a finger into a glove. I guess 
you know what the ship looked 
like. But did you know they zipped me into the pilot's seat? It 
wasn't a chair, more like a diver's 
suit; the only air on the ship 
was in that suit: the only water 
came in through a tube to my 
lips. Saved weight . . .** 

And the next eighty days were 
in that suit. It fed him, gave him 
water, removed his wastes. If 
necessary, it would have shot 
novocaine into a broken arm, 
tourniquetted a cut femoral artery or pumped air for a torn 
lung. It was a placenta, and a 
hideously uncomfortable one. 

In the suit thirty-three days 
going, forty-one coming back. 
The six days in between were 
the justification for the trip. 

Jack fought his ship down 
through absolute blindness: gas

clouds that closed his own eyes 
and confused the radar, down to 
the skin of an unknown world. 
He was within a thousand feet of 
the ground before he could see 
anything but swirling yellow. 
And then he landed and cut the 
rockets. 

"Well. I couldn't get out. of 
course," he went on. "For forty 
or fifty reasons, somebody else 
will have to be the first man to 
set foot on Venus. Somebody who 
doesn't care much about breathing, I guess. Anyway, there I was, 
looking at it." He shrugged his 
shoulders, looked baffled. "I've 
told it a dozen times at lectures, 
but I've never got it over. I tell 
'em the closest thing to it on 
Earth was the Painted Desert. 
Maybe it was; I haven't been 
there. 

"The wind blows hard on 
Venus and it tears up the rocks. 
Soft rocks blow away and make 
dust storms. The hard ones — 
well, they stick out in funny 
shapes and colors. Big monument things, some of them. And 
the most jagged hilts and crevasses you can imagine. It's something like the inside of a cave, 
sort of, only not dark. But the 
light is — funny. Nobody ever saw 
light like that on Earth. Orangybrownish light, brilliant, very 
brilliant, but sort of threatening. 
Like the way the sky is threatening in the summer around sun


set just before a smasher of a 
thunderstorm. Only there never 
is any thunderstorm because 
there isn't a drop of water 
around." 

He hesitated. "There is lightning. Plenty of it, but never any 
rain ... I don't know, Mitch," 
he said abruptly. "Am I being 
any help to you at all?" 

I looked at my watch and saw 
that the return jet was about to 
leave, so I bent down and turned 
off the recorder in my briefcase. 
(Turned, nor clicked. Mercury 
switches.) 

"You're being lots of help, 
Jack," I said. "But I'll need more. 
And I have to go now. Look, can 
you come up to New York and 
work with me for a while? I've 
got everything you said on tape, 
but I want visual stuff, too. Our 
artists can work from the pix 
you brought back, but there must 
be more. And you're a lot more 
use than the photographs for 
what we need." I didn't mention 
that the artists would be drawing impressions of what Venus 
would look like, if it were different from what it was. "How 
about it?" 

Jack leaned back and looked 
cherubic, but, though he made 
me sweat through a brief recap 
of the extensive plans his lecture 
agent had made for his next few 
weeks, he finally agreed. The 
Shriners' talk could be canceled.

he decided, and the appointments 
with his ghost writers could be 
kept as well in New York as in 
Washington. We made a date for 
the following day just as the PA 
system announced that my flight 
was ready. 

"I'll walk you to the plane," 
Jack offered. He slipped down 
from the chair and threw a bill 
on the table for the waiter. 

We walked together through 
the narrow aisles of the bar out 
into the field. Jack grinned and 
strutted a little at some exclamations that went up as he was 
recognized. The field was almost 
dark, and the glow of Washing

ton backlighted the silhouettes 
of hovering aircraft. Drifting toward us from the freight terminal 
was a huge cargo 'copter, a fiftytonner, its cargo nacelle gleaming 
in colors as it reflected the lights 
below. It was no more than a

bad to clutch my hat against the 
downdraft from its whirling 
vanes. 

"Damn-fool bus drivers. 1 ' Jack 
grunted, glaring up at the "copter. "They ought to put those 
things on G.C.A. Just because 
they're maneuverable, those fanjockies think they can take them

cartons of Starrzclius Verily food 
packets. One of the crimson 
cylinders rolled to my toes and 
I stupidly picked it up and 
looked at it. 

Overhead, the lightened 'copter 
fluttered up and away, but I 
didn't see it go. 

"For God's sake, get it off 
them!" Jack was shrilling, tugging at me. We had not been 
alone on the field. From under 
the buckled aluminum reached 
an arm holding a briefcase, and 
through the compound noises in 
my ears I could hear a bubbling 
sound of human pain. I let Jack 
pull me to the tangled metal and 
we tried to heave it. I got a 
scratched hand and tore my 
jacket, and then the airport people got there and brusquely ordered us away. 

I don't remember walking 
there, but by and by I found 
that I was sitting on someone's 
suitcase, back against the wall 
of the terminal, with Jack O'Shea 
talking excitedly to me. He was 
cursing all cargo 'copter pilots 
and blackguarding me for standing there like a fool when he'd 
seen the nacelle clamps opening, 
and a great deal more that I 
didn't get. I remember him 
knocking the red box of breakfast 
food from my hand impatiently. 
The company psychologists say 
I am not unusually sensitive or 
timorous, but I was in a state of 



shock that lasted until Jack was 
loading me into my plane. 

Later on, the hostess told me 
five people had been caught under 
the nacelle, and the whole affair 
seemed to come into focus. But 
not until we were halfway back 
to New York. At the time all I 
remembered, all that seemed important, was Jack saying over 
and over, bitterness and anger 
written on his porcelain face: 
"Too damn many people, Mitch. 
Too damn much crowding. I'm 
with you every inch of the way. 
We need Venus, Mitch, we need

I pressed the button over the

remembering that it had once

smiled at her as she opened the

She unsmilingly said two 
things: "You're late, Mitch," and, 
"I thought you were going to call 
first." 

I walked in and sat down. "I 
was late because I almost got 
killed and I didn't call because 
I was late. Does that square us?*'

She asked the question I 
wanted her to ask and I told her 
how close I had come to death 
that evening. 

Kathy is a beautiful woman 
with a warm, friendly face, her 
hair always immaculately done 
in two tones of blonde, her eyes 
usually smiling. I, have spent a 
great deal of time looking at her, 
but I never watched more attentively than when I told her 
about the cargo nacelle near-miss. 

It was, on the whole, disappointing. She was really concerned for me, beyond doubt. But 
Kathy's heart opens to all people 
and I saw nothing in her face 
to make me feel that she cared 
more for me than anyone else. 

So I told her my other big 
news, the Venus account and my 
stewardship of it. It was more 
successful; she was startled and 
excited and happy, and kissed me 
in a flurry of good feeling. But 
when I kissed her back, as I'd 
been wanting to do for months, 
she drew away and went to sit 
on the other side of the room, 
ostensibly to dial a drink. 

"You rate a toast," she said. 
"Champagne at the least. Mitch, 
it's wonderful news!" 

1 seized the chance. "Will you 
help me celebrate? Really celebrate?" 

Her brown eyes were wary. 
"Urn," she said. "Sure I wilt. 
We'll do the town together — my 



treat and no arguments about it. 
The only thing is, I'll have to 
leave you punctually at 2400. 
I'm spending the night in the 
hospital. I've a hysterectomy to 
do in the morning and I mustn't 
get to sleep too late. Or too 
drunk, either." 

But she smiled. 

Once again I decided not to 
push my luck too far. "Great," 
I said, and I wasn't faking. Kathy 
is a wonderful girl to do the town 
with. "Let me use your phone?" 

By the time wc had our drinks, 
I had arranged for tickets to a 
show, a dinner table and a reservation for a nightcap afterward. 

Kathy looked a little dubious. 
"It's a pretty crowded program 
for five hours, Mitch," she said. 
"My hysterectomy isn't going to 
like it if my hand shakes." But I 
talked her out of it. Kathy is 
more resilient than that. Once 
she did a complete trepan the 
morning after we'd spent the entire night screaming out our 
tempers at each other, and it 
had gone perfectly. 

^T*HE dinner, for me, was a 
failure. I don't pretend to be 
an epicure who can't stand anything but new protein. I definitely 
am, however, a guy who gets sore 
when he pays new-protein prices 
and gets generated protein instead. The texture of the shashlik we both ordered was all right.

but you can't hide the taste. I 
scratched the restaurant off my 
list and apologized to Kathy for 
it. But she laughed it off and the 
Show afterward was fine. Hypnotics often give me a headache, 
but I slipped right into the trance 
state this time as soon as the film 
began and was none the worse 
for it later. 

The night club was packed and 
the headwaiter had made a mistake in the time for our reservations. We had to wait five minutes 
in the anteroom, and Kathy 
shook her head very decisively 
when I pleaded for an extension 
on the curfew. But when the 



headwaiter showed us with the 
fanciest apologies and bows to 
our places at the bar and our 
drinks came, she leaned over and 
kissed me again. I felt just fine. 

"Thanks," she said. "That was 
a wonderful evening, Mitch. Get 
promoted often, please. I like it." 

I struck a cigarette for her and 
one for myself, and somebody 
behind us began to holler: "You 
fools! It's not too late I" 

We turned and gaped. It was a 
gaunt, wild-eyed youngster in the 
entrance of the night club, waving his arms and yelling: "Look 
at yourselves, you fools! The air 
is blue with your smoke! You're 




 




burning up and throwing away 
the product of land that should 
be growing food!" 

A flying squad of waiters 
headed his way suddenly stopped and disintegrated into very 
scared individuals. He had a pistol in his hand. 

"Don't stop .me!" he shouted 
hoarsely. "I don't want to hurt 
anybody, but I must bring you 



my message. It's not too late ! 
Stop your smoking! Stop your 
drinking! Don't you know there 
are starving children in this 
world? How dare you drink alcohol made from grain? Think 
of the evil and folly of it! Give 
up your wickedness! Turn Connie and learn what peace of mind 
is like! It's not too — " 

He hadn't guarded his back. 
Two or three bluecoats of the 
Metropolitan Protection Corporation were standing over his lank 
body. 

Kathy yelled: "Gangway! I'm 
a doctor!" put her head down and 
charged through the milling

crowd. When I reached her side, 
she was saying to the M.P.C. 
foreman: "Killed instantly." 

"Thanks, miss," the foreman 
said modestly. "It was just my 
duty. Any good protection man 
could have done as well." 

"I didn't — " she began, and 
tfu-n sighed. "Mitch, shall we 
get back to the bar? We must 
have time for another drink." 

We got our places back and 
ordered again. "What a hell of 
a thing to happen." I said, angry 
that the young lunatic had 
chosen to mess up our evening. 

"I absolutely do not want to 
talk or think about it," Kathy 
said. "Make me forget. What 
were we talking about?" 

"Well, I was going to say that 
we always have fun together." 

"And I was going to say that 
I knew what you were leading 
up to and that the answer still 
was no." 

"I know you "were," I said 
glumly. "Let's get out of here." 

She paid the tab and we left, 
inserting our anti-soot plugs as 
we hit the street. 

"Cab, sir?" asked the doorman. 

"Yes, please," Kathy answered. 
"A tande'm." 

He whistled up a two -man 
pedicab and Kathy gave the lead 
boy the hospital's address. "You 
can come if you like, Mitch," she 
said, and I climbed in beside her. 
The doorman gave us a starting 



push and the cabbies grunted 
getting up momentum. 

For a moment it was like our 
courtship again: the friendly 
dark, the slight, musty smell of 
the canvas top, the squeak of the 
springs. But for a moment only. 

"Watch what you're going to 
say, Mitch," she warned. 

"Please, Kathy, let me go 
through it anyhow. It won't take 
long. Wc were married eight 
months ago — all right," I said 
quickly as she started to object. 
"It wasn't an absolute marriage. 
But we took the interlocutory 
vows. Do you remember why we 
did that?" 

She said patiently after a moment: "We were in love." 

"I loved you and you loved 
me. And we both had our work 
to think about, and we knew that 
sometimes it made us a little 
hard to get along with. So we 
made it interim. It had a year 
to run before we had to decide 
whether to make it permanent." 
I touched her hand and she did 
not move it away. "Kathy dear, 
don't you think we knew what 
we were doing then? Can't we at 
least give it the year's trial? 
There are still four months to 
go". Let's try it. If the year ends 
and you don't want to file your 
certificate — well, I won't be able 
to ny you didn't give me a 
chance. As for me. I don't have 
to wait. My certificate's on file 




 



now and I won't change." 

We passed a street light and 
I saw her Hps twisted into an 
expression I couldn't quite read. 

"Oh, damn it all, Mitch," she 
said unhappily, "I know you 
won't change. Must I call you 
names to convince you that it's 
hopeless? I used to think you 
were a sweet guy, an idealist who 
cared for principles and ethics 
instead of money. You told me 
so yourself, very convincingly. 
You were very plausible about 
my work, too. You boned up on 
medicine, you came to watch me 
operate three times a week, you 
told all our friends how proud 
you were to be married to a surgeon. It took me three months to 
find out what you meant by that. 
Anybody could marry a girl 
who'd be a housewife. But it 
took a Mitchell Courtenay to 
marry a star class surgeon and 
make her a housewife." 

Her voice was tremulous. "I 
couldn't take it, Mitch. I never 
will be able to. Not the arguments, the sulkiness and the everand-ever fighting. I'm a doctor. 
Sometimes a life depends on me. 
If I'm all torn up inside from 
battling with my husband, that 
life isn't safe. Can't you see that?" 

I asked quietly: "Kathy, don't 
you still love me?" 

She was absolutely quiet for 
a long moment. Then she laughed 
wildly and very briefly. "Here's 



the hospital, Mitch. It's midnight." 

We climbed out. "Wait," I 
growled at the lead boy, and 
walked with her to the door. She 
wouldn't kiss me good night and 
she wouldn't make a date to see 
me again. I stood in the lobby 
for twenty minutes to make sure 
she was really staying there that 
night, and then got into the cab 
to go to the nearest shuttle station. I was in a vile mood. It 
wasn't helped any when the lead 
boy asked innocently after I paid 
him off : "Say, mister, what does 
idealist mean? Was the dame an 
eye doctor?" 

" 'Idealist' is Spanish for 'mind 
your own business,' " I told him 
evenly. On the shuttle I wondered 
sourly how rich I'd have to be 
before I could buy privacy. 

The slain Connie rankled, too. 
They seemed to be capable of 
anything you can name in the 
way of damn-foolishness, but this 
was the first time I'd heard that 
they were against smoking and 
drinking. Hell, there was no real 
grain used in whisky. Maybe he 
wasn't a real Connie, just a crackbrained kid who thought he was. 
There were such idiots. And there 
were other people who weren't 
Connies and who didn't think 
they were Connies, but who got 
scragged for being Connies anyway. And there were borderline 
cases where you could never be 



CtAVY PLANET 



a* 



sure. University teachers caught 
with a well -warn copy of Our 
Plundered Planet. They always 
satd they had only a scholarly 
interest in it, of course. Just what 
you'd expect them to say, Connie or not. And naturally the 
Connies would try to plant people in universities where they 
could influence the young and 
make recruits. Better be safe than 
sorry — or was it? 

I thought of old man Hollister. 
I was pretty sure he was a sound 
man, but a whispering campaign 
swept Schocken Associates, complete with all sorts of very circumstantial anecdotes, the kind 
of thing you couldn't make up. 
He resigned after about three 
months of it and died shortly 
afterward, Hollister didn't look 
as if he were capable of blowing 
up a DDT factory or garotting a 
hydraulic mine operator or burning down a penicillin warehouse. 
But somebody did these things. 
Presumably somebody as innocent-looking as Hollister. 

Damn them all! I might have 
gone home with Kathy if that kid 
hadn't got himself killed! 

Tl/TY temper was no better when 
L * " I arrived at the office next 
morning. It took all Hester's tact 
to keep me from biting her head 
off in the first few minutes, and 
it was by the grace of God that 
it was not a Board morning. After 



I'd got my mail and the overnight accumulation of inter-office 
memos, Hester intelligently disappeared for a while. When she 
came back, she brought me a cup 
of coffee — authentic plantationgrown coffee. 

"The matron in the ladies* 
room brews it on the sly," she 
explained. "Usually she won't let 
us take it out because she's afraid 
of the Coffiest team. But now 
that you're star class — " 

I thanked her and gave her 
Jack O'Shea's tape to put through 
channels. Then I went to work. 

First came the matter of the 
sampling area, and a headache 
with Matt Runstead. He's Market Research, so I had to work 
with and through him. But he 
didn't show any inclination to 
work with me. I put a map of 
Southern California in the projector while Matt and two of his 
helpers boredly sprinkled cigarette ashes on my floor. 

Witli the pointer, I outlined 
the test areas and controls: "San 
Diego through Tijuana; half the i 
communities around L. A. and 
the lower tip of Monterrey. Those 
will be controls. The rest of CalMexico, from L.A. down, we'll 
use for tests. You'll have to be 
on the scene, I guess, Matt; I'd 
recommend our Diego offices as 
headquarters. Harris is in charge 
there and he's a pretty good 
man." 



30 




 



Runstead grunted. "Not a flake 
of snow from year's end to year's 
end. Couldn't sell an overcoat 
there if you threw in a slave girl 
as a premium. Why don't you 
leave market research to somebody who knows something about 
it? Don't you see how climate 
nulls your sigma?" 

The younger of his stampedout-of-tin assistants started to 
back the boss up, but I cut him 
off . Runstead had to be consulted 
on test areas — it was his job — 
but Venus was my project and 
I was going to run it. 

I said, .sounding just a little 
nasty: "Regional and world income, age, density of population, 
health, psyche-friction, age-group 
distribution and mortality causes 
and rates are seven-place sigmas, 
Matt. Cal-Mex was designed personally by God Himself as a perfect testing area. In a tiny 
universe of less than a hundred 
million, it duplicates every important segment of North America. I 
will not change my project and 
we are going to stick to the area 
/ indicated." 

"It won't work. The temperature is the major factor. Anybody 
should be able to see that." 

"I'm not just anybody, Matt. 
I'm the guy in charge." 

Matt Runstead stubbed out his 
cigarette and got up. "Let's go 
talk to Fowler," he said and 
walked out. There wasn't any
GRAVY PLANET 



thing for me to do except follow 
him. 

As I left, I heard the older of 
his helpers picking up the phone 
to notify Fowler Schocken's secretary that we were coming. He 
had a team all right. I spent a 
little time wondering how I could 
build one like that myself before 
t got down to the business of 
planning how to put it to Fowler. 

But Fowler Schocken has a 
surefire technique of handling interstaff hassels. He worked it on 
us. When we came in, he said exuberantly: "The two men I want 
to see! Matt, can you put out a 
fire for me? It's the A.I.G. people. 
They claim our handling of the 
PregNot account is hurting their 
trade. They're talking about 
going over to Taunton unless we 
drop PregNot. Their billing isn't 
much, but a birdie told me that 
Taunton put the idea into their 
heads." 

He went on to explain the intricacies of our relationship with 
the American Institute of Gynecologists. I listened only halfheartedly ; our ''Babies without 
Maybes" campaign on their sexdetermination project had given 
them at least a twenty per cent 
plus on the normal birthrate. 
They should be solidly ours after 
that. 

Runstead said : "They don't 
have a case, Fowler. We sell 
liquor and hangover remedies 

31 



both. They've got no business 
yelling about any other account. 
Besides, what does this have to 
dc with Market Research?" 

Fowler chuckled happily. 
"They'll expect the account executives to give them the usual 
line — but instead we'll let you 
handle them yourself. Snow them 
under with a whole line of charts 
and statistics to prove that PregNot never prevents a couple from 
having a baby; it just permits 
them to postpone it until they 
can afford to do the job right. 
In other words, their unit of sale 
goes up and their volume stays 
the same. And it'll be one in the 
eye for Taunton. Lawyers get 
disbarred for representing conflicting interests; we've got to 
make sure that any attempt to 
foist the same principle on our 
profession is nipped in the bud. 
Think you can handle it for the 
old man. Matt?" 

"Sure," Runstead grumbled. 
"What about Venus?" 

Fowler twinkled at me. "What 
about it, Mitch? Can you spare 
Matt for a while?" 

"Forever," I said. "In fact, 
that's what I came to see you 
about. Matt's scared of Southern 
California." 

Runstead belligerently dropped 
his cigarette and let it lie, crisping the nylon pile of Fowler's 
rug. "What am I supposed to be 
scared of?" 



"Ensy." said Fowler. "Matt 
isn't scared. Let's hear him out." 

Runstead glowered at me. "All 
I said was that Southern California isn't the right test area. 
What's the big difference between 
Venus and here? Heat! We need 
a test area with continentalaverage climate. A New Englander might be attracted by the 
heat on Venus; a Tijuana man, 
never. It's too damn hot in CalMex already." 

"Urn," said Fowler Schocken. 
"Tell you what, Matt. This needs 
going into, and you'll want to 
get busy on the A.I.G. thing. Pick 
out a good man to vice you on 
the Venus section while you're 
out and we'll have it hashed over 
at the section meeting tomorrow 
afternoon. Meanwhile — " He 
glanced at his desk clock — "Senator Danton has been waiting for 
seven minutes. All right?" 

It was clearty not all right with 
Matt, and I felt cheered for the 
rest of the day. 

rpHINGS went well enough. 

Development came in with a 
report on what they'd gleaned 
from O'Shea's tape and all the 
other available material. The 
prospects for manufacture were 
there. Quick, temporary ones like 
little souvenir globes of Venus 
manufactured from the organics 
floating around in what we laughingly called the "air" of Venus. 




 



Long-term ones — an assay had 
indicated pure iron: not ninenines pure and not ninety-nine 
nines pure, but absolute iron that 
nobody would ever find or make 
on' an oxygen planet like Earth. 
The labs would pay well for it. 
And Development had not developed, but found a remarkable little thing called a high-speed 
Hilsch Tube. Using no power, it 
could refrigerate the pioneers' 
homes by using the hot tremendous winds of Venus themselves. 
It was a simple thing that had 
been lying around since 1943. 
Nobody had had any use for it, 
because nobody had had that 
kind of wind to play with before. 

Tracy Collier, the Development 
liaison man with Venus Section, 
tried also to tell me about nitrogen-fixing catalysts. I nodded 
from time to time and gathered 
that sponge-platinum "sown" on 
Venus would, in conjunction with 
the continuous, terrific lightning, 
cause it to "snow" nitrates and 
"rain" hydrocarbons, purging the 
atmosphere of formaldehyde and 
ammonia. 

"Expensive?" I asked cautiously. 

"As expensive as you want it 
fn he," he said. "The platinum 
doesn't get used up, you know. 
Use one gram and-take a million 
years or more. Use more platinum and take less time." 

I didn't really understand, but 



obviously it was good news. I 
patted him and sent him on his 
way. 

Industrial Anthropology gave 
me a setback. Ben Winston complained: "You can't make people 
want to live in a steam-heated 
sardine can. All our folkways are 
against it. Who's going to travel 
sixty million milts for a chance 
to spend the rest of his life cooped 
up in a tin shack — when he can 
stay right here on Earth and have 
corridors, elevators, streets, roofs, 
all the wide-open space a man 
could want? It's against human 
nature, Mitch!" 

He went on trlling me about 
the American way of life — walked 
to the window with me and 
pointed out at the hundreds of 
acres of rooftops where men and 
women could walk around in the 
open air, wea ri n g si mple soot extractor plugs in their nostrils 
instead of a bulky oxygen helmet. 

Finally I got mad. I said: 
"Somebody must want to go to 
Venus. Otherwise why would they 
buy Jack O'Shea's book the way 
they do? Why would the voters 
stand still for a billion-and-up 
appropriation to build the rocket ? 
God knows I shouldn't have to 
lead you by the nose this way, 
but here's what you are going to 
do: Survey the book-buyers, the 
repeat -viewers of O'Shea's TV 
shows, the ones who come early 
to his lectures and stand around 



CRAVY PLANET 



C'3 



talking in the lobby after. Find 
out about the Moon colony— 
what types they have there. And 
then we'll know who to aim our 
ads at. Any arguments?" 
There weren't. 

Hester had done wonders of 
scheduling that first day and I 
made progress with every section 
head involved. She couldn't read 
my paper work for me, though, 
and by quitting time I had six 
inches of it stacked by my right 
arm. Hester volunteered to stay 
with me, but there wasn't really 
anything for her to do. I let her 
bring me sandwiches and another 
cup of coffee, and chased her 
home. 

IT was after eleven by the time 
I was done. I stopped off in 
an all-night diner on the fifteenth 
floor before heading home. It was 
a wiadowless box of a place where 
the coffee smelled of the yeast it 
was made from and the ham in 
my sandwich bore the taint of 
soy. But it was only a minor annoyance and out of my mind 
when I got home. For as I opened 
the door to my apartment, there 
was a snick and an explosion, 
and something slammed into the 
door frame by my head. I ducked 
and yelled. Outside the window, 
a figure dangling from a rope 
ladder drifted away, a gun in its 
hand. 

I was stupid enough to run 



over to the window and gawk out 
at the helicopter- borne figure. I 
would have been a perfect target 
if it had been steady enough to 
shoot at me again, but it luckily 
wasn't. 

Surprised at my calm, I called 
the Metropolitan Protection Corporation. 

"Are you a subscriber, sir?" 
their operator asked. 

"Yes, dammit. For six years. 
Get a squad over here!" 

"One mo-ment, Mr. Courtenay. . . , Mr. Mitchell Courtenay? Copysmith, star class?" 

"Will you kindly get a man 
over here before the character 
who just took a shot at me comes 
back?" 

"I have your record before me, 
sir. I am sorry, but your account 
is canceled. We do not accept star 
class accounts at the general rate 
because of the risk of industrial 
feuds, sir." She named a figure 
that made each separate hair on 
my head stand on end. "There 
is," she said helpfully, "a rebate 
due you on the unexpired portion 
of your previous policy." 

"Thanks," I said heavily, and 
rang off. I put the ProgramPrinting to Quarry Machinery 
reel of the Telephone Red Book 
into the reader and spun it to 
Protective Agencies. I got turndowns from three or four and 
finally one sleepy -sounding private detective agreed to come on 



34 




 



over for a stiff fee. 

He showed up in half an hour 
and I paid him, and all he did 
was annoy me with unanswerable 
questions and look for nonexistent fingerprints. After a 
while he went away, saying he'd 
work on it. 

I got to bed and eventually to 
sleep with one of the unanswered 
questions chasing itself around 
and around in my head: 

Who would want to shoot a 
simple, harmless advertising man 
like me? 

IV 

¥ TOOK my courage in my 
■ hands and walked briskly 
down the hall to Fowler Schocken's office. He might throw me 
out of the office for asking, but 
I needed an answer and he might 
have it. ' 

Ahead of me, his door opened 
explosively and Tildy Mathie 
lurched out. She stared at me, 
but I'll take commercial oath 
she didn't know my name. 

"Rewrites," she said wildly. "I 
slave my heart out for that whitehaired old rat, and what does he 
give me? Rewrites. 'This is good 
copy, but I want better than good 
copy from you,' he says. 'Rewrite 
it/ he says. 'I want drive, and 
beauty, and humble, human 
warmth, and ecstasy and all the 
tender, sad emotion of your sweet 



womanly heart,' he says, 'and I 
want it in fifteen words.' I'll give 
him fifteen words!" she sobbed, 
and pushed past me down the 
hall. "But they won't be sweet or 
womanly!" 

I cleared my throat, knocked 
once and walked into Fowler's 
office. There was no hint of hia 
brush with Tildy in the smile he 
gave me. In fact, his pink, cleareyed face belied my suspicions, 
but — I had been shot at. 

'Til only be a minute, Fowler," I said. "I want to know 
whether you've been playing 
rough with Taunton Associates." 

"I always play rough," he 
twinkled. "Rough, but clean." 

"I mean very, very rough and 
very, very dirty. Have you, by 
any chance, tried to have any of 
their people shot?" 

"Mitch! Really r 

"I'm asking," I went on doggedly, "because last night a 
'copter-borne marksman tried to 
plug me when I came home. I 
can't think of any angle except 
retaliation from Taunton." 

"Scratch Taunton," he said 
positively. 

I took a deep breath. "Fowler,** 
I said, "man-to-man, you haven't 
been Notified? I may be out of 
line, but I've got to ask. It isn't 
just me. It's the Venus Project." 

There were no apples in Fowler's cheeks at that moment, and 
I could see in his eyes that my 



GRAVY PLANET 



3S 



Job and my sttft-class rating hung 
in the balance. 

He said: "Mitch, I made you 
star class because I thought you 
could handle the responsibilities 
that came with it. It isn't just the 
work. I know you can do that. 
I thought you could live up to 
the commercial code as well." 

I hung on. "Yes, sir," I said. 

He sat down and lit a Starr. 
After just exactly the right splitsecond of hesitation, he pushed 
the pack to me. "Mitch," he said. 
"You're a youngster, Mitch, only 
star class a short time. But you've 
got power. Five words from you, 
and in a matter of weeks or 
months, half a million consumers 
will find their lives completely 
changed. That's power, Mitch, 
absolute power. And you know 
the old saying. Power ennobles. 
Absolute power ennobles absolutely." 

"Yes, sir," I said. I knew all 
the old sayings. I also knew that 
he was going to answer my question eventually. 

"Ah, Mitch." he said dreamily, 
waving his cigarette, "we have 
our prerogatives and our duties 
and our particular hazards. You 
can't have one without the others. 
If we didn't have feuds, the whole 
system of checks and balances 
would be thrown out of gear." 

"Fowler," I said, greatly daring, "you know I have no complains about the system. It 



works; that's all you have to say 
for it. I know we need feuds. And 
it stands to reason that if Taunton files a feud against us, you've 
got to live up to the code. You 
can't broadcast the information; 
every executive in the shop would 
be diving for cover instead of getting work done. But — Venus 
Project is in my head, Fowler. I 
can handle it better that way. If 
I write everything down, it slows 
things up." 

"Of course," he said. 

"Suppose you were Notified 
and suppose I'm the first one 
Taunton knocks oft' — what happens to Venus Project?" 

"You may have a point." he 
admitted. "I'll level with you, 
Mitch. There has been no Notification." 

"Thanks, Fowler," I said sincerely. "I did get shot at. And 
that accident in Washington — 
maybe it wasn't an accident. You 
don't imagine Taunton would try 
anything without Notifying you, 
do you?" 

"I haven't provoked them to 
that extent, and they'd never do 
a thing like that anyhow. They're 
cheap, they're crooked, but they 
know the rules of the game. Killing in an industrial feud is a misdemeanor. Killing without Notification is a commercial offense. 
And that means — " 

I nodded. "Cerebrin." 

Fowler beamed. "What I like 



34 




 



about you, Mitch, is you can face 
facts. No pussy-footing; call a 
spade a spade. Well," he said 
cheerfully, "I'm sorry I can't help 
you out. You haven't been getting 
into any of the wrong beds, shall 
I say?" 

"No," I said. "My life's been 
very dull. The whole thing's 
crazy. It must have been a mistake. But I'm glad that whoeverit-was couldn't shoot." 

"So am I, Mitch, so am I! You 
saw O'Shea?" He had already 
dismissed the shooting from his 
mind. 

"I did. He's coming up here 
today. He'll be working closely 
With me." 

"Splendid! Some of that glory 
will rub off on Fowler Schocken 
Associates if we play our cards 
right. Dig into it, Mitch. I don't 
have to tell you how." 

It was a dismissal. 

/"VSHEA was waiting in the 
anteroom of my office. It 
wasn't an ordeal; most of the female personnel was clustered 
around him as he sat perched on 
a desk, talking gruffly and 
authoritatively. There was no 
mistaking the looks in their eyes. 
He was a thirty-five-inch midget, 
but he had money and fame, the 
two things we drill and drill into 
the population. O'Shea could 
have taken his pick of them. I 
wondered how many he had 

It A V Y PLANET 



picked since his return to fiarth 
in a blaze of glory. 

We run a taut office, but the 
girls didn't scatter until I cleared 
my throat. 

"Morning, Mitch," O'Shea said. 
"You over your shock?" 

"Sure. And I ran right into 
another one. Somebody tried to 
shoot me." I told the story and 
he grunted thoughtfully. 

"Have you considered getting 
a bodyguard?" he asked. 

"Of course. But I won't. It 
must have been a mistake." 

"Like that cargo nacelle?" 

I paused. "What's on your 
mind? I can't be down in anybody's little black book. Jack. 
The stakes are too high. Fowler's 
ruled out retaliation, and unprovoked murder for business advantage — " I lowered my voice — 
"means cerebrin for five seconds 
and gas." 

He made a soundless whistle 
and we went into my office. When 
the door closed, he said: "I never 
heard that. About you-know." 

"Well, keep it quiet. You can 
tell anyoody with good sense, 
somebody upstairs commercially, 
because they probably know it 
already. But the consumers 
wouldn't understand. It's been 
that way for years. The corporations got fed up with undercover 
business assassinations and put 
an amendment through Congress 
authorizing the use of several 

S7 



pharmaceutical preparations in 
connection with capital punishment. Cerebrin's in the list, buried 
under an obscure name. Everybody who ought to know about 
it knows. Result, no more killings." 

He nodded. "Five seconds is 
what?" 

"One quarter of the first phase. 
Roughly equivalent to being 
sandpapered all over your body, 
blinded with a million-power 
searchlight, deafened by a two 
hundred-decibel siren, and strangled by hydrogen sulfide continuously for fifteen years. Care to 
try some?" 

"Thanks very much, but no, 
thanks." 

"That's the way everybody 
feels. I fed your tape to — " 

His mind was still on the drug. 
"I've heard about the second 
phase," he said tentatively. 

"Classified information." 

O'Shca grinned. "You can't 
pull that on me, Mitch. What 
you should have said was : 
'Frankly, Jack, I don't know a 
thing about it.' Now give!" 

"You've got me, but all this 
strikes me as unnecessarily morbid. Well, people have come back 
from very light dosages of the 
first phase — most of them broken, 
some of them only very badly 
bent. Nobody's come back from 
the whole twenty seconds. Jack, 
can we please get off this sub


ject? It gives me the horrors." 
- "Permission granted," he 
beamed. "Now, let's go to work 
— but on what?" 

"First, words. We want words 
that are about Venus, words 
that'll tickle people. Make them 
sit up. Make them muse about 
change, and space, and distant 
planets. Words to make them a 
little discontented with what they 
are and a little hopeful about 
what they might be. Words to 
make them feel noble about feeling the way they do, and not 
foolish. Words that will do all 
these things and also make them 
happy about the existence of Indiastries and Starrzelius Verily 
and Fowler Schocken Associates. 
Words that will do all these 
things and also make them feel 
unhappy about the existence of 
Universal Products and Taunton 
Associates." 

He was staring at me with his 
mouth open. "You serious?" he 
finally exclaimed. 

"You're on the inside now. 
That's the way we work. That's 
the way we worked on you." 

"What are you talking about?" 
he demanded. 

"You're wearing Starrzelius 
Verily clothes and shoes, Jack. 
It means wc got you. Taunton 
and Universal worked on you, 
Starrzelius and Schocken worked 
on you, and you chose Starrzelius. Schocken reached you. 



36 




 



Smoothly, without ever bei ng 
aware that it was happening, you 
became persuaded that there was 
something rather nice about 
Starrzelius clothes and shoes, and 
that there was something rather 
not-nice about Universal clothes 
and shoes." 

"I never read the ads," he said 
defiantly. 

"Our ultimate triumph is 
wrapped up in that statement." 

"I solemnly promise," O'Shea 
said, "that as soon as I get back 
to my hotel room-, I'll send my 
clothes down the incinerator 
chute — " 

"Luggage, too?" I asked. 
"'Starrzelius luggage?" 

He looked startled for a moment and then regained his calm. 
"Starrzelius luggage, too," he 
said. "And then I'll pick up the 
phone and order a complete set 
of Universal luggage and apparel. 
And you can't stop me." 

"I wouldn't think of stopping 
you. It means more business for 
Starrzelius. Tell you what you're 
going to do: You'll get your complete set of Universal luggage 
and apparel. You'll wear it for 
a while with a vague, submerged 
discontent. It's going to work on 
your libido, because our ads for 
Starrzelius have convinced you 
that it isn't quite virile to buy 
from any other firm. Your selfesteem will suffer; deep down, 
you'll know that you're not wear


ing the best. Your subconscious 
won't stand up under much of 
that. You'll find yourself 'losing' 
bits of Universal apparel. You'll 
find yourself 'accidentally' putting your foot through the cuff of 
your Universal pants. You'll find 
yourself overpacking the Universal luggage and damning it for 
not being roomier. You'll walk 
into stores and in a fit of momentary amnesia about this conversation you'll buy Starrzelius, 
bless you." 

O'Shea laughed uncertainly. 
"And you did it with words?" 

"Words and pictures. Sight and 
sound and smell and taste and 
touch. And the greatest of these 
is words. Do you read poetry?" 

"My God, of course not! Who 
can?" 

"1 don't mean the contemporary stuff; you're quite right 
about that. I mean Keats. Swinburne — the great lyricists." 

"I used to, a little," he cautiously admitted. "What about 
it?" 

"I'm going to ask you to spend 
the morning and afternoon with 
one of the world's great poets: a 
girl named Tildy Mathis. She 
doesn't know she's a poet; she 
thinks she's a boss copywriter. 
Don't enlighten her. It might 
make her unhappy.

slow time, 

Sylvan historian — * 
That's the sort of thing she would 
have written before the rise of 
advertising. The correlation is 
perfectly clear. Advertising up, 
lyric poetry down. There are only 
so many people capable of putting together words that stir and 
move and sing. When it became 
possible to earn a very good living in advertising by exercising 
this capability, lyric poety was 
left to untalented screwballs who 
had to shriek for attention and 
compete by eccentricity." 

"You talk pretty damn funny 
yourself." 

"Words are my business, 
Jack." 

"Why are you telling me all 
this?" he wanted to know. 

"I said you're on the inside. 
There's a responsibility that goes 
with the power. In this profession, 
we reach into the souls of men 
end women. We do it by taking 
talent and — redirecting it. Nobody should play with lives the 
way we do unless he's, motivated 
by the highest ideals." 

"I get you," he said softly. 
"Don't worry about my motives. 
I*m not in this thing for money 
or fame. I'm in it so the human 
race can have some elbow room 
and dignity again." 

"That's it," I said, putting on 
Expression Number One. But inwardly I was startled. The "high


est ideal" I had been about to 
mention was Sales. 

I buzzed for Tildy. "Talk to 
her," I said. "Answer her questions. Ask her some. Make it a 
long, friendly chat. Make her 
share your experiences. And, 
without knowing it, she'll write 
lyric fragments of your experiences that will go right to the 
hearts and souls of the readers. 
Don't hold out on her." 

"Certainly not. Uh, Mitch, will 
she hold out on me?" His face 
was from a Tanagra figurine of 
11 hopeful young satyr. 

"That depends on you. I told 
you people are stirred by words. 
Women are people. Jack." 

But I wondered about Kathy. 
She hadn't stayed stirred. 

npHAT afternoon, for the first 
-* time in four months, Kathy 
called me. 

"Is anything wrong?" I asked 
worriedly. "Anything I can do?" 

She laughed. "Nothing wrong, 
Mitch. I just wanted to say hello 
and tell -you thanks for a lovely 
evening." 

"How about another one?" I 
promptly asked. 

"Dinner at my place tonight 
suit you?" 

"It certainly does. What color 
dress will you be wearing? I'm 
going to buy you a flower!" 

"Oh, Mitch, you needn't be 
that extravagant: we aren't court 



 



ing. But there is something I 
wish you'd bring." 

"Name it and it's yours." 

"Jack O'Shea. Can you manage it? I saw by the 'cast that 
he came into town this morning 
and I suppose he's working with 
you." 

Very dampened. I said : "Yes, 
be is. I'll check with him and call 
you back. Arc you over at the 
hospital?" 

"Yes. And thanks so much for 
trying. I'd love to meet him." 

I got in touch with O'Shea in 
Tildy's office. "You booked up 
for tonight?" I asked. 

"I don't seem to be," he said 
morosely. "My proposition didn't 
sell so good. What's yours?" 

"Quiet dinner at home with 
my wife and me. She happens to 
be beautiful and a good cook and 
a star class surgeon and excellent 
company." 

"You're on." 

So I called Kathy back and 
told her I'd bring the social lion 
about seven. 

He stalked into my office at 
six, grumbling: "I'd better get a 
good meal out of this, Mitch. 
Your Miss Mathis appeals to 
me. What a dope! Does she have 
sense enough to come in out of 
the smog?" 

"I don't believe so," I said. 
**But Keats was properly hooked 
by a designing wench, Byron 
didn't have sense enough to stay 



out of the V-D ward, and Swinburne made a tragic mess out of 
his life. Do I have to go on?" 

"No. What kind of marriage 
have you got?" 

"Interlocutory," I said, a little 
painfully. 

He raised his eyebrows a trifle. 
"My mother was an Kaster-duty 
Catholic," he said, "and I guess 
I'm a lapsed Catholic or worse. 
But still there's something about 
those arrangements that sets my 
teeth on edge." 

"Mine, too," I said, "at least 
where it involves me. In case 
Tildy missed telling you, my 
beautiful and talented wife does 
not want to finalize it, we don't 
live together, and unless I change 
her mind in four months, we'll 
be washed up." 

"Tildy did miss telling me," he 
said. "You're pretty sick about 
it, seems to me." 

I almost invited his sympathy. 
I almost started to tell him how 
rough it was, how much I loved 
her, how she wasn't giving me an 
even break, how I'd tried everything I could think of and nothing would convince her. And then 
I realized that I'd be telling it to 
a sixty-pound midget who, if he 
married, might become his wife's 
helpless plaything or butt of ridicule. 

"Middling sick," I said. "Let's 
go, Jack. Time for a drink and 
then the shut11 j ."

KATHY had never looked lovelier and I wished 1 hadn't let 
her talk me out of shooting a 
couple of days' pay on a flower 
from Tiffany's. 

She said hello to O'Shea and 
he announced loudly and immediately: "I like you. There's no 
gleam in your eye. No 'Isn't he 
cute?' gleam. No 'A girl's got a 
right to try anything once' gleam. 
No 'My, he must be rich and 
frustrated?' gleam. In short, you 
like me and I like you." 

As you may have gathered, he 
was a little drunk. 

"You are going to have some 
coffee, Mr. O'Shea," she said. "I 




 



rutned mysetf to provide real 
pork sausages and real apple 
sauce, and you're going to taste 
them.'* 

"Coffee?" he said. "Coffiest for 
me, ma'am. To drink coffee 
would be disloyal to the great 
firm of Fowler Schocken Associates, with which I am associated. Isn't that right, Mitch?" 

"I give indulgence this once," 
I said. "Besides, Kathy doesn't 
believe the harmless alkaloid in 
Coffiest is harmless.** 

Luckily, she was in the kitchen 
corner with her back turned when 
I said that, and cither missed it 
or could afford to pretend she 
did. We'd had a terrific four-hour 
battle over that very point, complete with epithets like "babypoisoner" and "crackpot -reformer" and a few others that 
were shorter and nastier. 

The coffee was served and 
quenched O'Shea's mild glow. 

Dinner was marvelous. The 
pork sausages turned out to be 
not patties, but crisp tittle cylinders; I'd never had them that 
way before and asked about 
them. 

"That's how they usually were 
made," Kathy explained. "The 
casing around the meat is organic, too. It's the small intestine 
of the hog." 

"Gah!" I said, astonished and 
disgusted. 

"Now, Mitch," she said evenly. 



"It tasted good. This nicy-nicy 
business about food isn't smart. 
Carry it to extremes and it becomes very foolish indeed. I hear 
that in India it's no use to ship 
rice into a Northern famine area 
or wheat into a Southern famine 
area. The people just won't eat 
it. They'll lie down on a sack of 
it and starve." 

"Interesting," O'Shea commented. "And it did taste good. 
If I may ask — where did you get 
it?" 

She smiled. "I'm afraid I 
couldn't give you the — supplier's 
name without his permission. I'm 
sure you understand." 

"Of course. Lord. I wish I'd 
lived in the old days! Don't you, 
Mitch?" 

"Not me,** I said promptly. 
"You can moon about the spacious four-room apartments, and 
about buying all the new meat 
you want at fifty dollars a pound. 
Things are a little more cramped 
now, but think of what we have 
in added convenience. In my 
trainee days we did some research 
for Stirrzelius depilatory and I 
was the goat. I had to shave, 
with a razor, for one whole week! 
Unless you've been through that 
yourself, you don't know what 
it's like. No, we're better off nowadays." 

Kathy mused : "Wouldn't the 
simplest way out be to grow a 
beard?"

I stared at her, decided she 
was joking, and laughed. "Surely, 
Kathy, you'll admit that medical 
progress means we're healthier 
now than we used to be?" 

She struck a cigarette and exhaled a long plume of smoke hefore she answered. 

"Who knows? The Black 
Plague came to an end in the 
Middle Ages without the discovery of penicillin. Medical historians are still arguing about the 
great influenza epidemic of 19171919. Some of them say it was 
e coal shortage — no, not even 
that, just a breakdown of coal 
distribution. Surgery? Well, 1 did 
the hysterectomy this morning 
end got all the metastases — 
maybe. We still don't know about 
mental illness. But we do have 
an immense variety of things to 
shoot into people when they complain that it hurts here. Mr. 
O'Shea, if you go around saying 
that Dr. Nevin was saying thusand-so about medical progress, 
I'll first deny it and second cut 
your throat." 

"Respectfully noted," O'Shea 
said. "To keep this seminar going, 
I state that I am an aeronautical 
engineer and a good one. I've 
been exposed to the history of 
aviation. You know how nerveracking a flight is — traffic pattern 
up, congested lanes, traffic pattern down. I can't point to any 
golden age when things were bet


ter, but I've sometimes thought 
the whole approach was wrong 
since Kittyhawk. The theme song 
has always been bigger and 
faster; bigger and faster. Why not 
smaller and smoother? Why not 
slower and pleasanter?" 

I found myself hotly defending 
things as they are: bigger because 
you can do more with them, 
faster because it means increased 
command of natuVe — in effect, 
lengthening your active life. 

"You can lengthen your active 
life in a manner of speaking with 
cerebri/!," O'Shea objected. 
"What's so good about that?" 

"That's not what I mean — ." 

"You've been to the Moon, I 
suppose?'' Kathy asked O'Shea. 

"Not yet. One of these clays." 

"There's nothing there," I said. 
"It's a waste of time. One of our 
dullest, deadest accounts. I suppose we only kept it for the experience we'd get, looking ahead 
to Venus. A few hundred people 
mining — that's the whole story." 

"Excuse me," O'Shea said, and 
retired. 

I grabbed the chance. "Kathy, 
darling," I said, "it was real fine 
of you to ask me over. Does it 
mean anything?" 

She rubbed her right thumb 
end index finger together and I 
knew that whatever she would 
say after that would be a lie. "It 
might, Mitch. You'll have to give 
me time."

T threw away my secret 
weapon. "You're lying," I an* swered disgustedly. "You always 
do this before you lie to me." I 
showed her, and she let out a 
short laugh. 

"Fair's fair," she said with bitter amusement. "You always 
catch your breath and look right 
into my eyes when you lie to 
me." 

O'Shea returned and felt the 
tension at once. "I ought to be 
going," he said. 

There were the usual politenesses at the door, and Kathy 
kissed me good night. It was a 
long, warm, clinging kiss; altogether the kind of kiss that should 
start the evening rather than end 
it. It set her own pulse going — I 
felt that — but she closed the door 
on us. 

"You been thinking about a 
bodyguard again?" O'Shea asked. 

I thought it was an inexcusable 
crack and started to say something unpleasant. His face was 
abstracted; he had missed the 
by-play or ignored it. 

"The shooting was a mistake,'* 
I stubbornly said. 

"Let's stop by your place for 
a drink," he suggested ingenuously. 

The situation was almost pathetic. Sixty-pound Jack O'Shea 
was guarding me! "Sure," I said. 
We got on the shuttle. 

He went into the room first 



and turned on the light, and 
nothing happened. While sipping 
a very weak whisky and soda, he 
drifted around the place checking window locks, hinges and the 
like. 

"This chair would look better 
over there," he said. Over there, 
of course, was out of the line of 
fire from the window. I moved it. 

"Take care of yourself, Mitch," 
he said when he left, "That lovely 
wife and your friends would miss 
you if anything happened." 

The only thing that happened 
was that I barked my shin setting up the bed, and that was 
happening all the time. Even 
Kathy, with a surgeon's neat, economical movements, bore the 
scars of life in a city apartment. 
You set up the bed at night, you 
took it down in the morning, you 
set up the table for breakfast, 
you took it down to get to the 
door. No wonder some shortsighted people sighed for the spacious old days. I thought, settling 
myself luxuriously for the night. 

V 

•TlHINGS were rolling within a 
week. With Runstc^d out of 
my hair and at work on the 
PregNot-A.I.G. hassel, I could 
really grip the reins. 

Tildy's girls and boys were putting out the copy — temperamental kids, sometimes doing a line

a day with anguish; sometimes 
rolling out page after page effortlessly, with shining eyes, as 
though possessed. She directed 
and edited their stuff and passed 
the best of the best to me: nineminute commercial scripts, pix 
cut-lines, articles for planting, 
news stories, page ads, whispering campaign cue-lines, endorsements, jokes, limericks and puns 
(clean and dirty) to float through 
the country. 

Visual was hot. The airbrush 
and camera people were having 
fun sculpturing a planet. It was 
the ultimate in "Before and 
After" advertising, and they were 
caught by the sense of history. 

Development kept pulling rabbits out of hats. Collier once explained to me when I hinted that 
he might be over-optimistic: "It's 
energy, Mr. Courtenay. The Sun 
pours all that energy into Venus 
in the form of heat and molecular 
bonds and fast particles. Here on 
Earth we don't have that level of 
available energy. We use windmills to tap the kinetic energy of 
the atmosphere. On Venus we'll 
just build an accumulator, put up 
a lightning rod and jump back. 
It's an entirely different /eve/." 

Market Research Industrial 
Anthropology was at work in 
San Diego sampling the Cal-Mex 
area, trying Tildy's copy, Visual's layouts and films and extrapolating and interpolating. I had 



a direct wire to the desk of Ham 
Harris, Runstead's vice, in San 
Diego. 

A typical day began with a 
Venus Section meeting: pep talks 
by me, reports of progress by all 
hands, critique and cross-department suggestions. Harris, on the 
wire, might advise Tildy that "serene atmosphere" wasn't going 
well as a cue phrase in his sampling and that she should submit 
a list of alternatives. Tildy might 
ask Collier whether it would be 
okay to say "topaz sands" in a 
planted article which would hint 
that Venus was crawling with 
uncut precious and semi-precious 
stones. Collier might tell Visual 
that they'd have to make the atmosphere redder in a "before" 
panorama. And I might tell Collier to lay off because it was permissible license. 

After adjournment, everybody 
would go into production and I'd 
spend my day breaking ties, coordinating, and interpreting my 
d irecti ves from a bo ve down to 
the operational level. Before close 
of day, we'd hold another meeting which I would keep to some 
specific topic, such as integration 
of Starrzelius products into the 
Venus economy, or income-level 
of prospective Venus colonists 
for optimum purchasing power 
twenty years after landing. 

And then came the best part of 
the day. Kathy and I were going 




 



steady again. We were still under 
separate cover, but I was buoyantly certain that it wouldn't be 
long now. Sometimes she dated 
me. sometimes I dated her. There 
wasn't much serious talk. She 
didn't encourage it and I didn't 
press it. I thought that time was 
on my side. Jack O'Shea made 
the rounds with us once before 
he had to leave for a lecture in 
Miami, and that made me feel 
good, too. A couple of welldressed, good-looking people who 
were so high up they could entertain the world's number one 
celebrity. 

After a week of solid, satisfying 
progress on the job, I told Kathy 
it was time for me to visit the 
outlying installations — the rocket 
site in Nevada and sampling 
headquarters in San Diego. 

"Fine," she said. "Can I go 
with you?" 

I was silly-happy about it; it 
wouldn't be long now. 

THE rocket visit was routine. 
I had a couple of people there 
as liaison with Armed Forces, 
Republic Aviation, Bell Telephone Labs and U. S. Steel. They 
showed Kathy and me through 
the monster ship, glib as tourist 
guides: "... vast steel shell 
, . . more cubage than the average 
New York office building . . . 
closed-cycle food and water and 
air regeneration . . . one-third 



drive, one-third freight, one-third 
living space - . . heroic pioneers 
. . - insulation . . . housekeeping 
power . . . sunside-darkside heat 
pumps . . . unprecedented industrial effort . . . national sacrifice 
. . . national security . . ." 

Oddly, the most impressive 
thing about it to me was not the 
rocket itself, but the wide area 
around it. For a full mile the 
land was cleared: no buildings, 
no greenhouse decks, no food 
tanks, no Sun traps. Partly security, partly radiation. The 
gleaming sand cut by irrigation 
pipes looked strange. There probably wasn't another sight like it 
in North America. It troubled my 
eyes. Not for years had I focused 
them more than a few yards in 
any direction except up. 

"How strange," Kathy said at 
my side. "Could we walk out 
there?" 

"Sorry. Dr. Nevin," said one 
of the liaison men. "It's our 
perimeter. The tower guards are 
ordered to shoot anybody out 
there." 

"Have contrary orders issued," 
I told him. "Dr. Nevin and I 
want to walk." 

"Of course, Mr. Courtenay,** 
the man said, very worried. "I'll 
do my best, but it'll take a little 
time. I'll have to clear it with 
C.I.C., Naval Intelligence, C.I.A., 
F.B.I., A.E.C., Security and Intelligence— * 



GRAVY PLANET 



I looked at Kathy and she 
shrugged with helpless amusement. 

"Never mind," I said. 

"Thank God!" breathed my liaison man. "It's never been done 
before, so there aren't any channels to do it through. You know 
what that means." 

"I do indeed. Tell me, has all 
the security paid off?" 

"There's been no sabotage or 
espionage, foreign or Connie, that 
we know of." He rapped a 
knuckle of his right hand solemnly on a genuine oak engagement ring he wore on the third 
finger of his left hand. I made a 
mental note to have his expense 
account checked up on. A man 
on his salary had no business 
wearing such expensive jewelry. 

"The Connies interested?" I 
asked. 

He shrugged. "Who knows?" 
Would you like to meet Commander MacDonald and find 
out? He's the O.N.I, chief here. A 
specialist in Connies." 

*'Like to meet a Connie specialist, Kathy?" I asked. 

"If we have time," she said. 

"I'll have them hold the jet for 
you if necessary," the liaison man 
offered eagerly, trying hard to 
undo his fiasco on the tower 
guards. He led us through the 
tangle of construction shacks and 
warehouses to the Administration 
Building and past seven security 



check points to the office of the 
commander. 

He was one of those career officers who make you feel good 
about being an American consumer — quiet, competent, strong. 
He wore the class insignia of 
the Pinkerton Graduate School 
of Detection and Military Intelligence, Inc. It's veneer pine 
with an open eye carved on it; 
no flashy inlay work. But it's like 
a brand name. It tells you that 
you're dealing with quality. 

"You want to hear about Connies?" he asked quietly. "I'm 
your man. I've devoted my life 
to running them down." 

"A personal grudge, Commander?" I asked, thinking we'd 
hear something melodramatic. 

"No. Old-fashioned pride of 
workmanship if anything. I like 
the thrill of the chase, too, but 
there isn't much chasing. You 
get Connies by laying traps. Did 
you hear about the Wichita 
bombing? Of-course-I-shouldn'tknock - the - competition - but — 
Wilson Detection bungled that 
one badly. They should have 
known it was a setup for a Connie demonstration." 

"Why, exactly, Commander?'* 
Kathy asked. 

He smiled wisely. "Feel. The 
Connies don't like hydraulic mining — ever. Give them a chance to 
pull some wrecking and they'll 
take it if they can." 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE F1CT1 O H 



"But why don't they like hydraulic mining?" she persisted. 
"We've got to have coal and iron, 
don't we?" 

"Now," he said with pretended, 
humorous weariness, "you're asking me to probe the mind of a 
Connie. I've had them questioned 
for up to six hours at a stretch 
and never yet have they talked 
sense. If I caught the Wichita 
Connie, he'd talk willingly — but 
it would be gibberish. He'd tell 
me the hydraulic miner was destroying top-soil. I'd say yes, 
what about it? He'd say the topsoil can never be replaced. I'd 
say yes, it ean, if it had to be 
and anyway tank farming's better. He'd say something like tank 
farming doesn't provide animal 
cover and so on. It always winds 
up with him telling me the 
world's going to hell and people 
have got to be made to realize it." 

Kathy laughed incredulously. 

"They're fools, but they're 
roug/i," the commander went on. 
"They have discipline. A cell 
system. If you get one Connie, 
you usually get the two or three 
others in his cell, but you hardly 
ever get any more. There's no 
lateral contact between cells, and 
vertical contact with higher-ups 
is by rendezvous with middlemen. And of course the picture 
is clouded by what you might call 
'small-c' connies: neurotic youngsters, mental cases, occasionally 



professional criminals who fake a 
Connie demonstration so they 
can loot." 

"I think we saw one of those 
neurotic youngsters," Kathy said. 
She described the incident in the 
bar that had loused up our < vening the week before. 

The commander nodded positively. "Small-c. They don't carry 
arms unless they're going to use 
them, and the smoking-anddrinking angle is just theontical 
to them. They say they know it's 
'anti-survival' — in their jargon — 
but they say the conditions that 
cause smoking and drinking must 
be corrected Hrst. Yes, I think I 
know them and that's why I'm 
not especially worried about sabotage or a demonstration here. 
It doesn't have the right ring to 
it." 

"You're very reassuring, Commander," Kathy smiled as we 
got up. "Thank you so much." 

At the door, MacDonald cautioned us: "We don't talk to just 
anybody about the small-c connies, as I called them. The public 
thinks every demonstration is by 
the true Connie organization 
which is good for our purposes, 
The worse they think of Connies 
and the more afraid of them they 
are, the closer they cooperate 
with Intelligence and Security. 
Understood?" 

"My lips are sealed, Commander. Thanks again."

KATHY and I lolled back, 
watching the commercials 
parade around the passenger 
compartment of the jet at eye 
level. There was the good old 
Kiddiebutt jingle I worked out 
when I was a cadet. I nudged 
Kathy and told her about it as 
it blinked and chimed at us. 

All the commercials went blank 
and a utility announcement came 
on: "In compliance with Federal 
law, passengers are advised that 
they are now passing over the 
San Andreas Fault into earthquake territory, and that earthquake loss and damage clauses 
in any insurance they may carry 
are now canceled and will remain 
canceled until passengers leave 
earthquake territory." Then the 
commercials resumed their parade. 

"And," said Kathy, "I suppose 
it says in the small print that 
yak-bite insurance is good anywhere except in Tibet." 

"Yak-bite insurance?" I asked, 
astonished. "What would anyone 
carry that for?" 

"A girl can never tell when 
she'll meet an unfriendly yak, can 
she?" 

"I conclude that you're kidding." I said with dignity. "We 
ought to land in a few minutes. 
Personally, I'd like to pop in on 
Ham Harris unexpectedly. He's 
a good kid, but Runstead may 
have infected him with defeatism. 



There's nothing wocnt in OUT

"I'll come along wild you if

our visit. There had been some

blame that on the old-style construction that fell hard and in 
jagged hunks. Eventually people 
got used to it and — as you'd expect in southern California — even 
proud of it. Natives could cite 
you reams of statistics to prove 
that you stood more chance of 
being struck by lightning or a 
meteorite than you did of getting 
killed in one of their quakes. 

We got a speedy three-man 
limousine to pedal us to the local 
branch of Fowler Schocken Associates. 

The receptionist gave me my 
first setback. She didn't recognize my face and she didn't 
r< cognize my name when I gave 
it to her. She said lazily: "I'll see 
if Mr. Harris is busy. Mr. Courtney." 

"Mr. Courtenay, young lady. 
And I'm Mr. Harris's boss." 

Kathy and I walked in on a 
scene of idleness and slackness 
that curled, my hair. 

Harris, with his coat off, was 
ploying cards with two young 
employees. Two more were gaping, glassy-eyed, before a hypnoteleset. Another man was lackadaisically punching a calculator, 
one-finger system. 

"Harris!" I thundered. 

Everybody except the two men 
in trance swiveled my way, open


mouthed. I walked to the hypnoteleset and snapped it off. The 
pair came to, groggily. 

"Mum - mum - Mister Courtenay," Harris stuttered. "We 
didn't expect — " 

"Obviously. Let's go into your 
office." 

Unobtrusively, Kathy followed 
us. 

"Harris," I said, "I'm disturbed, gravely disturbed, by the 
atmosphere here. But that can 
be corrected — " 

His phone rang and I picked 
it up. 

A voice said excitedly: "Ham? 
He's here. Make it snappy; he 
took a limousine." 

"Thanks." I hung up. "Your 
tipster at the airport," I told Harris. He went white. "Show me 
your tally sheets," I said. "Your 
interview forms. Your punchcard 
codes. Your masters. Your sigmaprogress charts. Everything, in 
short, that you wouldn't expect 
me to ask to see. Get them out." 

He stood there a long, long 
time and finally said : "There 
aren't any." 

"What have you got to show 
me?" 

"Finalizations," he muttered. 
"Composites." 

"Fakes, you mean? Fiction, 
like the stuff you've been feeding 
us over the wire?" 

He nodded. His face was sick. 

"How could you do it, Har* 



GRAVY PLANET 



SI 



ris?" I demanded. "How could 
you do it?" 

He poured out a confused torrent of words. He hadn't meant 
to.'*It was his first independent 
job. Maybe he was just no good 
and it was better this way. He'd 
tried to keep the lower personnel 
Up to snuff while he was dogging 
it himself, but it couldn't be 
done; they sensed it and took liberties and he didn't dare check 
them up. His self-pitying note 
changed; he became weakly belligerent. What difference did it 
make? It was just preliminary 
paperwork. One man's guess was 
as good as another's. And anyway the whole project might go 
down the drain. What if he had 
been taking it easy? He bet there 
were plenty of other people who 
took it easy and everything came 
out all right just the same. 

"No," I said. "You're wrong 
and you ought to know you're 
wrong. Advertising depends on 
the sciences of sampling, areatesting and customer research. 
You've knocked the props from 
under our program. We'll salvage 
what we can and start again." 

He took a feeble stand: "You're 
wasting your time if you do that, 
Mr. Courtenay. I've been working closely with Mr. Runstead 
for a long time. I know what he 
thinks, and he's as big a shot as 
you are. He thinks this paperwork is just a lot of nonsense," 



"What," I asked sharply, "have 
you got to .back that statement 
up with? Letters? Memos? Taped 
calls?" 

"I must have something like 
that," he said, and dived into his 
desk. He flipped through papers 
and played snatches of tape for 
minutes while the look of fear 
and frustration on his face deepened. At last he said in bewilderment: 

"I can't seem to find anything, _ 
but I'm sure — " 

Sure he was sure. The highest 
form of our art is to convince 
the customer without letting him 
know he's being convinced. This 
weak sister had been indoctrinated by Runstead with the unrealistic approach and then sent 
in on my project, to do a good 
job of crumming it up. 

"You're fired, Harris." I said, 
"I wouldn't advise you to try for 
a job in the advertising profession after this. It would be a 
waste of time." 

I went into the office and announced: "You're through. All of 
you. Collect your personal stuff 
and leave the office. You'll get 
your checks by mail." 

They gaped. Beside me, Kathy 
murmured : "Mitch, is that really 
necessary?" 

"You're damned right it's necessary. Did one of them tip off 
the home office on what was 
going on? No; they just relaxed 



It 




 



and drifted. I said it was an infection, didn't I? This is it." 

Ham Harris drifted past us 
toward the door, hurt bewilderment on his face. He had been so 
sure Runstead would back him 
up. He had his crammed briefcase in one hand and his raincoat 
in the other. He didn't look at 
me. 

I went into his vacated office 
and picked up the direct wire to 
New York. "Hester? This is Mr. 
Courtenay. I've just fired the entire San Diego branch. Notify 
Personnel and have them do 
whatever's necessary about pay. 
And get me Mr. Runstead on the 
line." 

I drummed my fingers impatiently for a long minute and then 
Hester said: "Mr. Courtenay, I'm 
sorry to keep you waiting. Mr. 
Runstead's secretary says he's 
left for Little America on one of 
those tours. She says he cleaned 
up the A.I.G. thing and felt like 
a rest." 

"Felt like a rest? Good God! 
Hester, get me a New York to 
Little America reservation. I'm 
shooting right back on the next 
jet. I want to just barely touch 
ground before I zip off to the 
Pole. Got it?" 

"Yes, Mr. Courtenay." 

I hung up and found that 
Kathy was staring at me, "You 
know, Mitch, I've been uncharitable to you in my time, kicking 



about your bad temper. I can see 
where you got it, if this is a typical situation." 

"It's not typical," I said. "It's 
the worst case of obstructionism 
I've ever seen. But there's a lot 
of it in our line — everybody trying to make everybody else look 
bad so they'll look better. Darling, I've got to get to the field 
now and bull my way onto the 
next Eastbound. Do you want 
to come, too?" 

She hesitated. "You won't mind 
if I stay and do a little tourist 
stuff by myself?" 

"No, of course not. You have 
a good time. When you get back 
to New York, I'll be there." 

We kissed and I raced out. 
The office was clear by then and 
I told the building, manager to 
lock it until further notice after 
Kathy left. 

I looked up from the street. 
She waved at me from the 
strange, flimsy building. 

VI 

I SWUNG off the ramp at New 
York; Hester was right there. 
"Good girl," I told her, "When 
does the Pole rocket shoot off? M 
"Twelve minutes, from Strip 
Six, Mr, Courtenay. Here are 
your ticket and the . reservation. 
And some lunch in case — " 

"Fine. I did miss a meal." We 
headed for Strip Six, with me

chewing a generated cheese sandwich as I walked. "What's up at 
the office?" 

"E13 excitement about you firing the San Diego people. Personnel sent up a complaint to 
Mr. Schocken and he upheld you 
—approximately Force Four." 

That wasn't so good. Force 
Twelve — hurricane — would have 
been a blast from his office on 
the order of : "How dare you 
question the decision of a Board 
man working on his own project? 
Never let me hear again — " And 
so on. Force Four — rising gale, 
small craft malic Tor harbor — was 
something like: "Gentlemen. I'm 
sure Mr. Court: nay had perfectly 
good reasons for doing what he 
did. Often the Big Picture is lost 
to the purely routine workers in 
our organization — " 

I asked Hester: "Is Runstead's 
secretary just a hired hand or one 
of his — " I was going to say 
"stooges, *' but smoothly reversed 
my field — "one of his confidants?" 

"She's pretty close to him." 
Hester said cautiously. 

"What was her reaction to the 
San Diego business?" 

"Somebody told me she laughed 
her head off. Mr. Courtcnay." 
I didn't push it any harder. Finding out where. I stood with respect 
to the big guns was legitimate. 
Asking about the help was asking 
her to rat on them. Not that there 



weren't girls who did. "I expect 
to be right back." I told Hester. 
"All I want to do is straighten 
out something with Runstcad." 

"Your wife won't be along?" 
she asked. 

"No. I'm going to tear Runstead into five or six pieces; if 
Dr. Nevin came along, she might 
try to put them back together 
again." 

Hester laughed politely and 
said: "Have a pleasant trip. Mr. 
Courtenay." We were at the ramp 
on Strip Six. 

TT was a miserable trip on a 
*- miserable, undersized tourist 
rocket. We flew low and there 
were prism windows at all seats, 
which never fail to make me airsick. You turn your head and 
look out and you're looking 
straight down. Worse, all the ads 
were Taunton Associates jobs. 
You look out the window and 
just as you convince your stomach that everything's all right 
and yourself that it's interesting 
country below, a sleazy, oversexed Taunton ad for some inferior product opaques the window and one of their nagging, 
stupid jingles drills shrilly into 
your ear. 

Over the Amazon Valley, for 
example, I was inspecting Electric Three, which happens to be 
the world's biggest power dam, 
when :

Bolster Bra, Bolster Bra, 
Bolsters all the way; 
Don't you crumple, 
Don't you slumple; 
Keep them up to stay! 

The accompanying before-andafter live pix were in the worst 
possible taste, and I found myself thanking God again that I 
worked for Fowler Schocken Associates. 

It was the same off Tierra del 
Fuego. We left the great circle 
course 'for a look at the whale 
fisheries, vast sea areas inclosed 
by booms that let the plankton in 
and didn't let the whales out. I 
was watching with fascination as 
a cow whale nursed her calf — it 
looked something like an aerial 
refueling operation — when the 
window opaqued again for another dose of Taunton shock 
treatment: 

Sister, do you smell like this 
to your mister? The olfactory 
went on, and_ I had to use my 
carton while the ad chirped: No 
wonder he's hard to getf Use 
Swett! 

My seatmate, a nondescript 
customer m Universal apparel, 
watched sympathetically as I 
retched. "Too much for you, 
friend?" he asked, showing the 
maddening superiority people 
who suffer from motion-sickness 
know too well. 

**Uh, H I said. 



"Some of those ads are enough 
to make anybody sick." 

"Exactly what do you mean 
by that remark?" I asked evenly. 

It frightened him. "I only 
meant that it smelled a little 
strong," he said hastily. "Just 
that particular ad. I didn't mean 
ads in general. There's nothing 
wrong with me!" 

"Good for you," I said, and 
turned away. 

Still worried, he told me: "I'm 
perfectly sound, friend. I come 
from a good family. I went to a 
good school. I'm in the production end myself — die-maker in 
Philly — but I know the stuff's 
got to be sold. Channels of distribution. Building markets. Vertical integration. $ee? I'm perfectly sound J" 

"Okay," I grunted. "Then 
watch your mouth." 

He shriveled into his half of the 
seat. I hadn't enjoyed squelching 
him, but it was a matter of principle. A kid overhearing that kind 
of talk could be turned into a 
pushover for a slick Connie. 

WE were held up over Little 
America while a couple of 
other tourist craft touched down. 
One of them was from India and 
I mellowed at the sight. That 
ship, from nose to tail, was Indiastry-built. The crewmen were 
Indiastry-trained and Indiastryemployed. The passengers, wak


GRAVY PLANIT 



ing and sleeping, paid tribute 
minute by minute to Indiastry. 
And Indiastry paid tribute to 
Fowler Schocken Associates. 

A tow truck hauled us into 
the great double-walled plastic 
doughnut that is Little America. 
There was only one check point. 
Little America is an invisible export — a dollar trap for the tourists of the world, with no 
military value. (There are Polar 
military bases, but they are small, 
scattered and far under the ice, 
run by Columbia Field Forces, 
Inc.) A small thorium reactor 
heats and powers the place. Even 
if some nation desperate for fissionable material were to try to 
get it, it wouldn't have anything 
worth fighting for. Windmills eke 
out the thorium reactor, and 
there's some "heat pump" arrangement that I don't underst ind which ekes out the windmills. 

At the check point I asked 
about Runstead. The officer 
looked him up and said: "He's 
on the two-day tour out of New 
York. Thomas Cook and Son. His 
quarters are III-C-2205." He 
pulled out a map of the place 
and showed me that this meant 
third ring in. third floor up. fifth 
sector, twenty-second room. "You 
can't miss it. I can accommodate 
you with a nearby room, Mr. 
Courtenay — " 

"Thanks. Later." I shoved oFf 



and elbowed my way through 

crowds chattering in a dozen 
languages to III-C-2205 and rang 
the bell. No answer. 

A pleasant young man said to 
me: "I'm the tour director. Can 
I help you?" 

"Where's Mr. Runstead? I 
want to see him on business." 

"Dear me. We try to get away 
from all that. I'll look in my 
register if you'll just wait a moment." 

He took me to his office-bedroom-bath up the sector a way 
and pawed through a register. 
"The Starrzelius Glacier climb* 
he said. "He went alone. Left at 
0700, checked out in electric suit 
with R.D.F. and rations. He 
should be back in five hours or 
so. Have you arranged for quarters yet, Mr. — ?" 

"Not yet. I want to go after 
Runstead. It's urgent." And it 
was. I was going to burst a blood 
vessel if I didn't get my hands 
on him. 

The slightly fluttery tour director spent five minutes convincing me that the best thing to 
do was sign on for his tour and 
he'd arrange everything. Otherwise I'd be shifted from pillar to 
post buying and renting necessary equipment from concessionaires and then, like as not, be 
turned back at checkout and not 
able to find the concessionaires 
again while my vacation was

ticking away. I signed on and he 
beamed. He gave me a room in 
the sector — plenty of luxury. It 
would have been, ten by fourteen 
if it hadn't been slightly wedgeshaped. 

In five minutes he was dealing 
out equipment to me. "Power 
pack — strap it on so. That's the 
only thing that can go wrong; if 
you have a power failure, take a 
sleepy pill and don't worry. 
You'll freeze, but we'll pick you 
up before there's tissue damage. 
Boots. Plug them in so. Gloves. 
Plug them in. Coveralls. Hood. 
Snowglasses. Radio direction 
finder. Just tell the checkout 
guard, 'Starrzelius Glacier,' and 
he'll set it. Two simple switches 
plainly labeled 'out* and 'in.* Outward bound, it goes 'beep-beep* 
— ascending. I nward bound, it 
goes 'beep -beep' — descending. 
Just remember, going up the glacier, the tone goes up. Going 
down the glacier, the tone goes 
down. 

"Distress signal — a big red 
handle. You just pull and immediately you start broadcasting. 
The planes will be out in fifteen 
minutes. You have to pay the 
expenses for the search and rescue, so I wouldn't yank the handle just for a ride back. It's 
always possible to rest, have a 
sip of Coffiest and keep on going. 
Route-marked map. Snowshoes. 
Gyro-compass. Rations. Mr. 



Courtenay, you are equipped. I'll 
lead you to checkout." 

The outfit wasn't as bad as it 
sounded. I've been more heavily 
bundled up against the lakeside 
winds in a Chicago winter. The 
lumpy items, like the power pack, 
the R.D.F. and the rations, were 
well distributed. The snowshoes 
folded into a pair of staffs with 
steel points for ice climbing, and 
went into something like an 
archery quiver on my back. 

We passed public rooms on the 
way to checkout. A lot of drinking and petting seemed to be 
going on. The tour director 
sighed: "It's nice to have some 
of my people going out after they 
get here. Most of them — " He 
gestured. "And I have to be deaf, 
dumb and blind about who winds 
up in whose room. It's so discouraging at times!" 

Checkout was very thorough. 
They started with my heart and 
worked through my equipment 
with particular emphasis on the 
power pack. I passed, and they 
set the R.D.F. for Starrzelius 
Glacier, with sharp warnings not 
to overdo it. 

It wasn't cold inside the suit. 
For a moment only, I opened the 
face flap. Wham! I closed it 
again. Forty below, they had told 
me — a meaningless figure until 
my nose felt it for a split-second. 
I didn't need the snowshoes at 
the base of the towering plastic

doughnut; it was crust ice that 
my spike-soled shoes bit into. I 
oriented the map with the little 
gyro-compass and trudged off 
into the vast whiteness along with 
the proper bearing. From time to 
time I pressed my left sleeve, 
squeezing the molded R.D.F. 
switch and heard inside my hood 
a cheerful, reassuring "Beep-beep. 
Beep-beep. Beep-beep." 

There were some people frolicking in one party I passed and 
waved cheerily at. They seemed 
to be Chinese or Indians. What 
an adventure it must be for them! 
But, like poor swimmers hugging 
a raft, they did their frolicking

almost under the shadow of Little 
America. Farther out, there were 
some people playing a game I 
didn't know. They had posts with 
bottomless baskets set up at 
either end of a marked-off rectangular field; the object was to 
toss a large silicone ball through 
the baskets. Still farther out, 
there, was a skiing class with instructors in red suits. 

I looked back after trudging 
for what seemed only a few minutes and couldn't see the red suits 
or Little America any more — just 
a gray-white shadow. "Beepbeep," my R.D.F. said, and I 
kept going. Runstead was going 
to hear from me. Soon. 



The aloneness was eerie, but 
not unpleasant. Gradually, I 
began to realize why Fowler 
Schbcken had unerringly "picked 
. me to head the Venus Section. 
That remarkable man had 
known, somehow, that I was the 
kind of guy who could stand and 
maybe even enjoy the Antarctic 
; — or another planet. 

Was this how Jack O'Shea had 
felt? Was this why he fumbled 
for words to describe Venus and 
was never satisfied with the words 
he found? 

My feet plunged into a drift 
and I unshipped and opened the 
snowshoes. After a little stumbling experiment, I began an 
easy, sliding shuffle that was a 
remarkably pleasant way of covering ground. It wasn't floating, 
yet neither was it the solid jar 
of a shoe against a paved surface. We'd been selling people 
the notion that they were basically pioneers, and here I was buying the notion myself — and finding pride in it! 

T marched the compass course 
* by picking landmarks and 
going to them: an oddly curved 
ice hummock, a blue shadow on 
a swale of snow, a puffball cloud 
hanging low. The R.D.F. continued to confirm me. I was elated 
at my mastery of the wild, and 
after two hours I became wildly 
hungry with an urgency I'd never

known before in my life. 

I had to squat and open a 
siliconc-tissue bell into which I 
fitted. Exposing my no^e cautiously fi'om time to time, 1 
judged the air warm enough in 
five minutes. I ravenously gulped 
the self-heated stew and tea and 
tried to strike a cigarette. It lit, 
but on the second puff I was 
blinded with smoke. Regretfully, 
I put it out against my shoe, 
closed my face mask, stowed the 
little tent and stretched happily. 

After another bearing, I started 
off again. I told myself: "This 
Runstead thing is just a difference of temperament. He can't 
see the wide-open spaces and you 
can. There's no malice involved, 
lie just thinks it's a crackpot 
idea because he doesn't realize 
that there are people who go for 
it. All you've got to do is explain 
it — " 

That argument, born of wellbeing, crumbled at one touch of 
reason. Runstead was out on the 
glacier, too. He most certainly 
could see the wide-open spaces if, 
of all the places on Earth he 
could be, he chose the Starrzelius 
Olacier. Well, a showdown was 
Hfad ahead. "Beep-beep." 

I sighted through the compass 
»nd picked a black object on my 
course. I couldn't quite make it 
out, but it was visible and it 
wasn't moving. I broke into a 
shuffling run that made me pant, 



and against my will I slowed 
down. It was a man. 

When I was twenty yards 
away, the man looked impatiently Fit his watch, and I broke into 
the clumsy run again. 

"Matt!" I yelled. "Matt Runstead !" 

"That's right, Mitch," he said, 
as nasty as ever. He had folded 
skis thrust into the snow beside 
him. "You're sharp today." 

"What's — what's — " I panted. 

"I have time to spare," he . 
said, "but you've wasted enough 
of it. Good-by, Mitch." Whije I 
stood there, helpless with exhaustion, he picked up his folded skis, 
swung them. I fell back with 
pain, bewilderment and shamed 
rage bursting my head. I felt him 
fumbling at my chest and then I 
didn't feel anything for a while. 

I woke thinking I had kicked 
the covers off and that it was 
cold for early autumn. Then the 
ice-blue Antarctic sky knifed into 
my eyes and I felt the crumbly 
snow beneath me. It had happened, then. My head ached horribly and I was ceild. Too cold. 
I felt and found that the power 
pack was missing. No heat to 
the suit, gloves and boots. Ml 
power to the R.D.F., coming or 
going. No use to pull the emergency signal. 

I tottered to my feet and felt 
the cold grip mc like a vise. There 
were footprints punched into the

snow leading — where? There was 
the trail of my snowshoes. Stiffly 
I took a step back along that 
trail, and then another, and then 
another. 

The rations. I could thrust 
them into the suit, break the 
heat seals and let them fill the 
suit with temporary warmth. 

Plodding step by step, I debated: "Stop and rest while you 
drink the ration's heat or keep 
moving? You need a rest. Something impossible happened. Your 
head is aching. You'll feel better 
if you sit for a moment, open a 
ration or two and then go on." 

I didn't sit. I knew what that 
would mean. I fumbled a Coffiest 
can from its pocket with ringers 



that would barely obey me, and 
got it into my suit. My thumb 
didn't seem strong enough to pop 
the seal and I told myself: "Sit 
down for a moment and gather 
your strength. You don't have to 
lie down." But I wanted to. 

My thumb drove through the 
seal and the tingling heat was 
painful. 

It became a blur. I opened cans 
until I couldn't work them out of 
their pockets any more. And then 
I sat down, telling myself I'd get 
up in one more second for Kathy, 
two more seconds for K a thy, 
three more seconds for Kathy. 

But I didn't.
