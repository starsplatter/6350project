the highest mountain By BRYCE WALTON 

BRUCE heard their feet on 
the gravel outside and 
got up reluctantly to 
open the door for them. He'd 
been reading some of Byron's 
poems he'd sneaked aboard the 
ship; after that he had been on 
the point of dozing off, and now 
one of those strangely realistic 
dreams would have to be postponed for a while. Funny, those 
dreams. There were faces in them 
of human beings, or of ghosts, 



and other forms that weren't human at all, but seemed real and 
alive — except that they were also 
just parts of a last unconscious 
desire to escape death. Maybe 
that was it. 

" 'Oh that my young life were 
a lasting dream, my spirit not 
awakening till the beam of an 
eternity should bring the morrow," Bruce said. He smiled 
without feeling much of anything 
and added, "Thanks, Mr. Poe." 




 



Jacobs and Anhauser stood outside. The icy wind cut through 
and into Bruce, but he didn't 
seem to notice. Anhauser's bulk 
loomed even larger in the special 
cold-resisting suiting. Jacobs' 
thin face frowned slyly at Bruce. 

"Come on in, boys, and get 
warm," Bruce invited. 

"Hey, poet, you're still here!" 
Anhauser said, looking astonished. 

"We thought you'd be running 
off somewhere," Jacobs said. 

Bruce reached for the suit on 
its hook, started climbing into it. 
"Where?" he asked. "Mars looks 
alike wherever you go. Where did 
you think I'd be running to?" 

"Any place just so it was away 
from here and us," Anhauser said. 

"I don't have to do that. You 
are going away from me. That 
takes care of that, doesn't it?" 

"Ah, come on, get the hell out 
of there," Jacobs said. He pulled 
the revolver from its holster and 
pointed it at Bruce. "We got to 
get some sleep. We're starting up 
that mountain at five in the morning." 

"I know," Bruce said. "I'll be 
glad to see you climb the mountain." 

Outside, in the weird light of 
the double moons, Bruce looked 
up at the gigantic overhang of the 
mountain. It was unbelievable. 
The mountain didn't seem to 
belong here. He'd thought so when 



they'd first hit Mars eight months 
back and discovered the other 
four rockets that had never got 
back to Earth — all lying side by 
side under the mountain's shadow, 
like little white chalk marks on 
a tallyboard. 

They'd estimated its height 
at over 45,000 feet, which was 
a lot higher than any mountain 
on Earth. Yet Mars was much 
older, geologically. The entire 
face of the planet was smoothed 
into soft, undulating red hills by 
erosion. And there in the middle 
of barren nothingness rose that 
one incredible mountain. On certain nights when the stars were 
right, it had seemed to Bruce as 
though it were pointing an accusing finger at Earth — or a 
warning one. 

WITH Jacobs and Anhauser 
and the remainder of the 
crew of the ship, Mars V, seven 
judges sat in a semi -circle and 
Bruce stood there in front of 
them for the inquest. 

In the middle of the half-moon 
of inquisition, with his long legs 
stretched out and his hands 
folded on his belly, sat Captain 
Terrence. His uniform was black. 
On his arm was the silver fist 
insignia of the Conqueror Corps. 
Marsha Rennels sat on the extreme right and now there was 
no emotion at all on her trim, 
neat face. 



THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN 



AS 



He remembered her as she had 
been years ago, but at the moment he wasn't looking very hard 
to see anything on her face. It 
was too late. They had gotten 
her young and it was too late. 

Terrence's big, square face 
frowned a little. Bruce was aware 
suddenly of the sound of the 
bltak. never-ending wind against 
the plastilcne shelter. He remembered the strange misty shapes 
that had come to him in his 
dreams, the voices that had called 
to him, and how disappointed he 
had been when he woke from 
them, 

"This is a mere formality,'* 
Terrence finally said, "since we 
all know you killed Lieutenant 
Doran a few hours ago. Marsha 
saw you kill him. Whatever you 
say goes on the record, of course." 

"For whom?" Bruce asked. 

"What kind of question is that? 
For the authorities on Earth when 
we get back." 

"When you get back? Like the 
crews of those other four ships 
out there?" Bruce laughed without much humor. 

Terrence rubbed a palm across 
his lips, dropped the hand quickly 
again to his belly. "You want to 
make a statement or not? You 
shot Doran in the head with a 
rifle. No provocation for the attack. You've wasted enough of 
my time with your damn arguments and anti-social behavior. 



This is a democratic group. Everyone has his say. But you've 
said too much, and done too 
much. Freedom doesn't allow you 
to go around killing fellow crewmembers!'* 

"Any idea that there was any 
democracy or freedom left died 
on Venus," Bruce said. 

"Now we get another lecture!" 
Terrence exploded. He leaned 
forward. "You're sick, Bruce. 
They did a bad psych job on 
you. They should never have sent 
you on this trip. We need 
strength, all the strength we can 
find. You don't belong here." 

"I know," Bruce agreed indifferently. "I was drafted for this 
trip. I told them I shouldn't be 
brought along. I said I didn't 
want any part of it." 

"Because you're afraid. You're 
not Conqueror material. That's 
why you backed down when we 
all voted to climb the mountain. 
And what the devil does . 
Venus — ?" 

Max Drexcl's freckles slipped 
into the creases across his high 
forehead. "Haven't you heard him 
expounding on the injustice done 
to the Venusian aborigines. Captain? If you haven't, you aren't 
thoroughly educated to the crackpot idealism still infecting certain people." 

"I haven't heard it," Terrence 
admitted. "What injustice?" 

Bruce said, "I guess it couldn't

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



really be considered an injustice 
any longer. Values have changed 
too much. Doran and I were part 
of the crew of that first ship to 
hit Venus, five years ago. Remember? One of the New Era's 
more infamous dates. Drexel says 
the Venusians were aborigines. 
No one ever got a chance to find 
out. We ran into this village. 
No one knows how old it was. 
There were intelligent beings 
there. One community left on the 
whole planet, maybe a few thousand inhabitants. They made 
their last mistake when they came 
out to greet us. Without even an 
attempt at communication, they 
were wiped out. The village was 
burned and everything alive in 
it was destroyed." 

Bruce felt the old weakness 
coming into his knees, the sweat 
beginning to run down his face. 
He took a deep breath and stood 
there before the cold nihilistic 
stares of fourteen eyes. 

"No," Bruce said. "I apologize. 
None of you know what I'm talking about." 

Terrence nodded. "You're 
psycho. It's as simple as that. 
They pick the most capable for 
these conquests. Even the flights 
are processes of elimination. 
Eventually we get the very best, 
the most resilient, the real conquering blood. You just don't 
pass, Bruce. Listen, what do you 
think gives you the right to stand 



here in judgment against the 
laws of the whole Solar System?" 

"There are plenty on Earth 
who agree with me," Bruce said. 
"I can say what I think now because you can't do more than 
kill me and you'll do that regardless ..." 

He stopped. This was ridiculous, a waste of his time. And 
theirs. They had established a 
kind of final totalitarianism since 
the New Era. The psychologists, 
the Pavlovian Reflex boys, had 
done that. If you didn't want to 
be reconditioned to fit into the 
social machine like a human 
vacuum tube, you kept your 
mouth shut. And for many, when 
the mouth was kept shut long 
enough, the mind pretty well forgot what it had wanted to open 
the mouth for in the first place. 

A minority in both segments of 
a world split into two factions. 
Both had been warring diplomatically and sometimes physically, 
for centuries, clung to old ideas 
of freedom, democracy, , selfdeterminism, individualism. To 
most, the words had no meaning 
now. It was a question of which 
set of conquering heroes could 
conquer the most space first. So 
far, only Venus had fallen. They 
had done a good, thorough job 
there. Four ships had come to 
Mars and their crews had disappeared. This was the fifth attempt — 



THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN

IERRENCE said, "why did 
you shoot Doran?" 



"I didn't like him enough to 
take the nonsense he was handing me, and when he shot the — * 
Bruce hesitated. 

"What? When he shot what:-'" 

Bruce felt an odd tingling in 
his stomach. The wind's voice 
seemed to sharpen and rise to 
a kind of wail. 

"All right, I'll tell you. I was 
sleeping, having a dream. Doran 
woke me up. Marsha was with 
him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we were supposed to 
be working on. I've had these 
dreams ever since we got here." 

"What kind of dreams?" 

Someone laughed. 

"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your 
Pavlovian there," Bruce said. 
"People talk to me, and there are 
other things in the dreams. Voices 
and some kind of shapes that 
aren't what you would call human at all." 

Someone coughed. There was 
obvious embarrassment in the 
room. 

"It's peculiar, but many faces 
and voices are those of crew members of some of the ships out 
there, the ones that never got 
back to Earth." 

Terrence grinned. "Ghosts, 
Bruce?" 

"Maybe. This planet may not 
be a dead b-sll of clay. I've had 
A feeling there's something real 



in the dreams, but I can't figure 
it out. You're still interested?" 

Terrence nodded and glanced 
to either side. 

"We've seen no indication of 
any kind of life whatsoever," 
Bruce pointed out. "Not even an 
insect, or any kind of plant life 
except some fungi and lichen 
down in the crevices. That never 
seemed logical to me from the 
start. We've covered the planet 
everywhere except one place — " 

"The mountain," Terrence said. 
"You've been afraid even to talk 
about scaling it." 

"Not afraid," Bruce objected. 
"I don't sec any need to climb it. 
Coming to Mars, conquering 
space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew of the first 
ship here decided to climb the 
mountain, and that set a precedent. Every ship that has come 
here lias had to climb it. Why? 
Because they had to accept the 
challenge, And what's happened 
to them? Like you, they all had 
the necessary equipment to make 
a successful climb, but no one's 
ever come back down. No contact with anything up there. 

"Captain, I'm not accepting a 
ridiculous challenge like that. 
Why should I? I didn't come here 
to conquer anything, even a 
mountain. The challenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where 
ever you guys intend going before something bigger than you 




 



arc stops you — it doesn't interest 
me." 

"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth I" Terrence said, 
sitting up straight and rigid. 

"I know," Bruce said. "Anyway. I got off the track. As I 
was saying, I woke up from this 
dream and Marsha and Doran 
were there. Doran was shaking 
me. But I didn't seem to have 
gotten entirely awake; either that 
or some part of the dream was 
real, because I looked out the 
window — something was out 
there, looking at me. It was late, 
and at first I thought it might 
be a shadow. But it wasn't. It 
was misty, almost translucent, 
but I think it was something alive. 
I bad a feeling it was intelligent, 
maybe very intelligent. I could 
feel something in my mind. A 
kind of beauty and softness and 
warmth. I kept looking — " 

His throat was getting tight. He 
had difficulty talking. "Doran 
asked me what I was looking at, 
and I told him. He laughed. But 
he looked. Then I realized that 
maybe I wasn't still dreaming. 
Doran saw it, too, or thought he 
did. He kept looking and finally 
he jumped and grabbed up his 
rifle and ran outside. I yelled 
at him. I kept on yelling and ran 
after him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do 
you know it means any harm?' 
But I heard Doran's rifle go off 



before I could get to him. And 
whatever it was we saw, I didn't 
see it any more. Neither did 
Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't 
know. He had to kill it. That's 
the way you think." 

"What? Explain that remark." 

"That's the philosophy of conquest — don't take any chances 
with aliens. They might hinder 
our advance across the Universe. 
So we kill everything. Doran 
acted without thinking at all. 
Conditioned to kill everything 
that doesn't look like us. So I 
hit Doran and took the gun away 
from him and killed him. I felt 
sick, crazy with rage. Maybe 
that's part of it. Ail I know is 
that I thought he deserved to die 
and that I had to kill him, so I 
did." 

"Is that all, Bruce?" 

"That's about all. Except that 
I'd like to kill all of you. And 
I would if I had the chance." 

"That's what I figured." Terrence turned to the psychologist, 
a small wiry man who sat there 
constantly fingering his ear. 
"Stromberg, what "do you think 
of this gobbledegook? We know 
he's crazy. But what hit him? 
You said his record was good up 
until a year ago." 

Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape. 
"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia is caused by inner con

flict — Indecision between the older 
values and our present ones which 
he hasn't been able to accept. A 
complete case history would tell 
why he can't accept our present 
attitudes. I would say that he 
has an incipient fear of personal 
inadequacy, which is why he fears 
our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense 
which he's structured with his 
idealism, foundationed with Old 
Era values. Retreat into the past, 
an escape from his own present 
feelings of inadequacy. Also, he 
escapes into these dream fantasies." 

"Yes," Terrence said. "But 
how does that account for Doran's 
action ? Doran must have seen 
something — " 

"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another 
weak personality eliminated. Let's 
regard it that way. He imagined 
he saw something." He glanced 
at Marsha. "Did you see anything?" 

She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's 
eyes. •Nothing at all. There 
wasn't anything out there to see, 
except the dust and rocks. That's 
all there is to see here. We could 
stay a million years and never 
see anything else. A shadow 
maybe — " 

"AH right," Terrence interrupted. "Now, Bruce, you know 
the law rcgulnting the treatment 
of serious psycho cases in space?" 



*'Yes. Execution.** 

"No facilities for handling such 
cases en route back to Earth." 

"I understand. No apologies 
necessary, Captain." 

Terrence shifted his position. 
"However, we've voted to grant 
you a kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service 
from you, you can remain here 
on Mars after we leave. Youll 
be left food -concent rates to last 
a long time." 

"What kind of service?" 

"Stay by the radio and take 
down what we report as we go 
up the mountain." 

i'Why not?" Bruce said. "You 
aren't certain you're coming back, 
then?" 

"We might not," Terrence admitted calmly. "Something's happened to the others. We're going 
to find out what and we want it 
recorded. None of us want to 
back down and stay here. You 
can take our reports as they 
come in." 

"I'll do that," Bruce said. "It 
should be interesting." 

TJRUCE watched them go, away 
and up and around the immediate face of the mountain in 
the bleak cold of the Martian 
morning. He watched them disappear behind a high ledge, tied 
together with plastic rope like 
convicts. 

He stayed by the radio. He lost 




 



track of time and didn't care 
much if he did. Sometimes he 
took a heavy sedative and slept. 
The sedative prevented the 
dreams. He had an idea that the 
dreams might be so pleasant that 
he wouldn't wake up. He wanted 
to listen to Terrence as long as 
the captain had anything to say. 
It was nothing but curiosity. 

At fifteen thousand feet, Terrence reported only that they 
were climbing. 

At twenty thousand feet, Terrence said, "We're still climbing, 
and that's all I can report, Bruce. 
It's worth coming to Mars for — 
to accept a challenge like this!" 

At twenty-five thousand feet, 
Terrence reported, "We've put 
on oxygen masks. Jacobs and 
Drexel have developed some kind 
of altitude sickness and we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I can imagine plenty of tourists coming to 
Mars one of these days, just to 
climb this mountain! Mt. Everest 
is a pimple compared with this! 
What a feeling of power, Bruce!** 

From forty thousand feet, Terrencesaid, "We gauged this mountain at forty -five thousand. But 
here we are at forty and there 
doesn't seem to be any top. We 
can see up and up and the mountain keeps on going. I don't understand how we could have made 
such an error in our computations. I talked with Burton. He 



doesn't see how a mountain this 
high could still be here when the 
rest of the planet has been worn 
so smooth." 

And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with 
a voice that seemed slightly 
strained : "No sign of any of the 
crew of the other four ships yet. 
Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. 
Not a sign of any of them so 
far, but then we seem to have a 
long way left to climfci — " 

Bruce listened and noted and 
took sedatives and opened cans 
of food concentrates. He smoked 
and ate and slept. He had plenty 
of time. He had only time and 
the dreams which he knew he 
could utilize later to take care 
of the time. 

From sixty thousand feet. Terrence reported, "I had to shoot 
Anhauser a few minutes ago! He 
was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? 
One of my most dependable men. 
We took a vote. A mere formality, 
of course, whether we should continue climbing or not. We knew 
we'd all vote to keep on climbing. 
And then Anhauser dissented. He 
was hysterical. He refused to accept the majority decision. 'I'm 
going back down!' he yelled. So 
I had to shoot him. Imagine a 
man of his apparent caPjer 
turning anti-democratic like t':at!

tester for us in the future. flVfl

who the weaklings are." 

Bruce listened to the wind. It 
seemed to rise higher and higher. 
Terrence, who had climbed still 
higher, was calling. "Think of it! 
What a conquest! No man's ever 
done a thing like this. Like 
Stromberg says, it's symbolic! We 
can build spaceships and reach 
other planets, but that's not actual physical conquest. We feel 
like gods up here. We can see 
what we are now. We can see 
how it's going to be — " 

Once in a while Terrence demanded that Bruce say something 
to prove he was still there taking 
down what Terrence said. Bruce 
obliged. A long time passed, the 
way time does when no one cares. 
Bruce stopped taking the sedatives finally. The dreams came 
back and became, somehow, more 
real each time. He needed the 
companionship of the dreams. 

It was very lonely sitting there 
without the dreams, with nothing 
but Terrence's voice ranting excitedly on and on. Terrence didn't 
seem real any more; certainly not 
as real as the dreams. 

problem of where to put 
the line between dream and 
reality began to worry Bruce. He 
would wake up and listen and 
take down what Terrence was 
saying, and then go to sleep again 
with increasing expectancy. His 
dream took on continuity. He 



could return to the point where 
he had left it, and it was the 
same — allowing even for the time 
difference necessitated by his periods of sleep. 

He met people in the dreams, 
two girls and a man. They had 
names: Pietro, Marlene, Helene. 

Helene he had seen from the 
beginning, but she became more 
real to him all the time, until he 
could talk with her. After that, 
he could also talk with Marlene 
and Pietro, and the conversations 
made sense. Consistently, they 
made sense. 

The Martian landscape was entirely different in the dreams. 
Green valleys and rivers, or actually wide canals, with odd trees 
trailing their branches on the 
slow, peacefully gliding currents. 
Here and there were pastel-colored 
cities and there were things drifting through them that were alive 
and intelligent and soft and warm 
and wonderful to know. 

' . . . dreams, in their vivid 
coloring of life*, as in that fleeting, 
shadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings 
to the delirious eye more lovely 
things of paradise and love — and 
all our own! — than young Hope 
in his sunniest hour hath known 

So sometimes he read poetry, 
but even that was hardly equal 
to the dreams. 

And then he v/ould wake up 




 



and listen to Terrence's voice. He 
would look out the window over 
the barren frigid land where there 
was nothing but seams of worn 
land, like scabs under the brazen 
sky. 

"If I had a choice," he thought, 
"I wouldn't ever wake up at all 
again. The dreams may not be 
more real, but they're preferable." 

Dreams were supposed to be 
wishful thinking, primarily, but 
he couldn't live in them very 
long. His body would dry up 
and he would die. He had to stay 
awake enough to put a little energy back into himself. Of course, 
if he died and lost the dreams, 
there would'be one compensation 
— he would also be free jof Terrence and the rest of them who 
had learned that the only value 
in life lay in killing one's way 
across the Cosmos. 

But then he had a feeling Terrence's voice wouldn't be annoying him much more anyway. The 
voice was unreal, coming out of 
some void. He could switch off 
Terrence any time now, but he 
was still curious. 

"Bruce— Bruce, you still there? 
Listen, we're up here at what we 
figure to be five hundred thousand feet! It iS impossible. We 
keep climbing and now we look 
up and we can see up and up 
and there the mountain is going 
up and up — " 

And some time later: "Bruce, 

THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN 



Marsha's dying! We don't know 
what's the matter. We can't find 
any reason for it. She's lying here 
and she keeps laughing and calling your name. She's a woman, 
so that's probably it. Women 
don't have real guts." 

Bruce bent toward the radio. 
Outside the shelter, the wind 
whistled softly at the door. 

"Marsha," he said. 

"Bruce — " 

She hadn't said his name that 
way for a long time. 

"Marsha, remember how we 
used to talk about human values? 
I remember how you seemed to 
have something maybe different 
from the others. I never thought 
you'd really buy this will to 
conquer, and now it doesn't 
matter ..." 

He listened to her voice, first 
the crazy laughter, and then a 
whisper. "Bruce, hello down 
there." Her voice was all mixed 
up with fear and hysteria and 
mockery. "Bruce darling, are you 
lonely down there? I wish I were 
with you, safe . . . free . . . warm. 
1 love you. Do you hear that? I 
really love you, after all. After 
all . . . M 

Her voice drifted away, c. < 
back to him. "We're climb^'-' t e 
highest mountain. What are yna 
doing there, relating where it's 
peaceful and warm and sane? 
You always were such a calm 
guy. I remember now. What are 

71 



you doing — reading poetry while 
we climb tiie mountain? What 
was that, Bruce — that one about 
the mountain you tried to quote 
to me last night before you . . . 
I can't remember it now. Darling, 
what ... ?" 

¥JE stared at the radio. He hesitateV, reached out and 
switched on the mike. He got 
through to her. 

"Hello, hello, darling," he whispered. "Marsha, can you hear 
me?" 

"Yes, yes. You down there, all 
warm and cozy, reading poetry, 
darling. Where you can see both 
ways instead of just up and down. 
Up and down." 

He tried to imagine where she 
was now as he spoke to her, how 
she looked. He thought of Earth 
and how.it had been there, years 
ago, with Marsha. Things had 
seemed so different then. There 
was something of that hope in his 
voice now as he spoke to her, yet 
not directly to her, as he looked 
out the window at the naked 
frigid sky and the barren rocks. 

*' ' . . . and there ii nowhere to go 
from the top of a mountain, 
But down, my dear; 
And the springs that flow on the 
floor of the valley 
Will never seem fresh or clear 
For think inR of the glitter of the 
mountain water 
In the feathery green of the 
year . . . ' " 



The wind stormed over the 
shelter in a burst of power, buried the sound of his own voice. 

"Marsha, are you still there?" 

"What the devil's the idea, 
poetry at a time like this, or any 
time?" Terrence demanded. "Listen, you taking this down? We 
haven't run into any signs of the 
others. Six hundred thousand feet, 
Bruce! We feel our destiny. We 
conquer the Solar System. And 
we'll go out and out, and we'll 
climb the highest mountain, 
the highest mountain anywhere. 
We're going up and up. We've 
voted on it. Unanimous. We go 
on. On to the* top, Bruce! Nothing can stop us. If it takes ten 
years, a hundred, a thousand 
years, we'll find it. We'll find 
the top ! Not the top of th is 
world — the top of everything. 
The top of the universe!" 

Later, Terrence's voice broke 
off in the middle of something 
or other — Bruce couldn't make 
any sense out of it at all — and 
turned into crazy yells that faded 
out and never came back. 

Bruce figured the others might 
still be climbing somewhere, or 
maybe they were dead. Either 
way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He knew they would 
never come back down. 

He was switching off the radio 
for good when he saw the coloration break over the window. It 
was the same as the dream, but 



THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN 



for an instant, dream and reality 
seemed fused like two superimposed film negatives. 

He went to the window and 
looked out. The comfortable little 
city was out there, and the canal 
flowing past through a pleasantly 
cool yet sunny afternoon. Purple 
mist blanketed the knees of low 
hills and there was a valley, green 
and rich with the trees high and 
full beside the softly flowing canal water. 

The filmy shapes that seemed 
alive, that were partly translucent, drifted along the water's 
edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass wavered down the 
wind. 

He opened the shelter door and 
went out. The shelter looked the 
same, but useless now. How did 
the shelter of that bleak world 
get into this one, where the air 
was warm and fragrant, where 
there was no cold, from that 
world into this one of his dreams? 

The girl — Helene — was standing there leaning against a tree, 
smoking a cigarette. 

He walked toward her, and 
stopped. In the dream it had been 
easy, but now he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy 
that had grown between them. 
She wore the same casual slacks 
and sandals. Her hair was brown. 
She was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to 
look at because she seemed so 



peaceful. Content, happy with 
what was and only what was. 

He turned quickly. The shelter 
was still there, and behind it the 
row of spaceships — not like chalk 
marks on a tallyboard now, but 
like odd relics that didn't belong 
there in the thick green grass. Five 
ships instead of four. 

There was his own idHividual 
shelter beyond the headquarters 
building, and the other buildings. He looked up. 

There was no mountain. 

TT^OR one shivery moment he 
knew fear. And then the fear 
went away, and he was ashamed 
of what he had felt. What he had 
feared was gone now, and he 
knew it was gone for good and 
he would never have to fear it 
again. 

"Look here, Bruce. T wpndered 
how long it would take to get 
it through that thick poetic head 
of yours!" 

""Get what?" He began to suspect what it was all about now, 
but he wasn't quite sure yet. 

"Smoke?" she said. 

He took one of the cigarettes 
and she lighted it for him and 
put the lighter back into her 
pocket. 

"It's real nice here," she said. 
"Isn't it?" 

"I guess it's about perfect." 

"It'll be easy. Staying here. I 
mean. We won't be going to

Earth ever again, you know.** 

"I didn't know that, but I 
didn't think we ever would 
again." 

"We wouldn't want to anyway, 
would we, Bruce?" 
"No." 

He kept on looking at the place 
where the mountain had been. Or 
maybe it still was; he couldn't 
make up his mind yet. Which was 
and which was not? That barren 
icy world without life, or this? 

'* */s atl that we see or seem,' " 
he whispered, half to himself, 
" 'but a dream within a dream?' " 

She laughed softly. "Poe was 
ahead of his time." she said. "You 
still don't get it. do you? You 
don't know what's been happening?" 

"Maybe I don't." 

She shrugged, and looked in 
the direction of the ships, "Poor 
guys. I can't feel much hatred 
toward them now. The Martians 
give you a lot of understanding 
of the human mind — after they've 
accepted you, and after you've 
lived with them awhile. But the 
mountain climbers — we can see 
now — it's just luck, chance, we 
weren't like them. A deviant is 
a child of chance." 

"Yes," Bruce said. "There's a 
lot of people like us on Earth, 
but they'll never get the chance 
—the chance we seem to have 
here, to live decently . . . '* 

"You're beginning to see now 



which was the dream," she said 
and smiled. "But don't be pessimistic. Those people on Earth 
will get their chance, too, one of 
these fine days. The Conquerors 
aren't getting far. Venus, and then 
Mars, and Mars is where they 
stop. They'll keep coming here 
and climbing the mountain and 
finally there won't be any more. 
It won't take so long." 

She rose to her toes and waved 
and yelled. Bruce saw Pietro and 
Marlcnc walking hand in hand 
up the other side of the canal. 
They waved back and called and 
then pushed off into the water in 
a small boat, and drifted away 
and out of sight around a gentle 
turn. 

She took his arm and they 
walked along the canal toward 
where the mountain had been, or 
still was — he didn't know. 

A quarter of a mile beyond the 
canal, he saw the high mound 
of red, naked hill, corroded and 
ugly, rising up like a scar of the 
surrounding green. 

She wasn't smiting now. There 
were shadows on her face as the 
pressure on his arm stopped him. 

"I was on the first ship and 
Marlene on the second. None like 
us on the third, and on the fourth 
ship was Pietro. All the others 
had to climb the mountain — ** 
She stopped talking for a moment, and then he felt the pressure of her fingers on his arm. 



THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN

"I'm very glad you came on the 
fifth," she whispered. "Are you 
glad now?" 

"I'm very glad," he said. 

"The Martians tested us," she 
explained. "They're masters of 
the mind. I guess they've been 
grinding along through the evolutionary mill a darn long time, 
longer than we could estimate 
now. They learned the horror 
we're capable of from the first 
ship — the Conquerors, the climbers. The Martians knew more 
like them would come and go on 
into Space, killing, destroying for 
no other reason than their own 
sickness. Being masters of the 
i.-'ind, the Martians are also capable of hypnosis — no, that's not 
really the word, only the closest 
our language comes to naming it. 
Suggestion so deep and strong 
that it seems real to one human 
or a million or a billion; there's 
no limit to the number that can 
be influenced. What the people 
who came off those ships saw 
wasn't real. It was partly what 
the Martians wanted them to see 
and feel — but most of it, like 
the desire to climb the mountain, 
was as much a part of the Conquerors' own psychic drive as it 
Was the suggestion of the Marti- T.." 

f3' c waved her arm slowly to 
e be a peak. "The Mirtians 
r-iride the mountain real. So real 
that it could be seen from space, 



measured by instruments . „ « 
even photographed and chipped 
for rock samples. But you'll see 
how that was done, Bruce, and 
realize that this and not the 
mountain of the Conquerors is 
the reality of Mars. This is the 
Mars no Conqueror will ever see." 

HpHEY walked toward the ugly 
red mound that jutted above 
the green. When they came close 
enough, he saw the bodies lying 
there . . . the remains, actually, 
of what had once been bodies. He 
felt too sickened to go on walking. 

"It may seem cruel now," she 
said, "but the Martians realized 
that there is no cure for the will 
to conquer. There is no safety 
from it, either, as the people of 
Earth and Venus discovered, unless it is given an impossible obstacle to overcome. So the Martians provided the Conquerors 
with a mountain. They themselves 
wanted to climb. They had to." 

He was hardly listening as he 
walked away from Helene toward the eroded hills. The crew 
members v of the first four ships 
were skeletons tied together with 
imperishably strong rope about 
their waists. Far beyond them 
were those from Mars V, too 
freshly dead to have decnyed 
much . . . Anhauser with his rope 
cut, a bullet in his head: Jacobs 
and Marsha and the others . . . 
Terrence much past them all. He

had managed to climb higher 
than anyone else and he lay with 
his arms stretched out, his fingers 
still clutching at rock outcroppings. 

The trail they left wound over 
the ground, chipped in places for 
holds, red elsewhere with blood 
from torn hands. Terrence was 
more than twelve miles from the 
ship — horizontally. 

Bruce lifted Marsha and carried her back over the rocky dust, 
into the fresh fragrance of the high 
grass, and across it to the shade 
and peace beside the canal. 

He put her down. She looked 
peaceful enough, more peaceful 
than that other time,, years ago, 
when the two of them seemed to 
have shared so much, when the 
future had not yet destroyed her. 
He saw the shadow of Helene 
bend across Marsha's face 
against the background of the 
silently flowing water of the cool, 
green canal. 

"You loved her?" 

"Once," Bruce said. "She might 
have been sane. They got her 
when she was young. Too young 
to fight. But she would have, I 
think, if she'd been older when 
they got her." 

He sat looking down at 
Marsha's face, and then at the 
water with the leaves floating 
down it. 

" ' . . . And the springs that 
flow on the floor of the valley 



will never seem fresh or clear 
for thinking of the glitter of the 
mountain water in the feathery 
green of the year ...'*' 

He stood up, walked back with 
Helene along the canal toward 
the calm city. He didn't look 
back. 

"They've all been dead quite 
a while," Bruce said wonderingly, 
"Yet I seemed to be hearing from 
Terrence until only a short time 
ago. Are — are the climbers still 
climbing — somewhere, Helene?" 

"Who knows?" Helene answered softly. "Maybe. I doubt 
if even the Martians have the 
answer to that." 

They entered the city.
