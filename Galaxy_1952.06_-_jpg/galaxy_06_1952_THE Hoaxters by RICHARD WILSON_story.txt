THE Hoaxters by RICHARD WILSON


YOU get yourself stuck off 
on a rock in space and 
after a while you begin to 
go nuts. Naturally. That's why 
Sam Black upset the chess board 



halfway through a game he certainly had not been losing to Ales 
Hurd. 

''Sorry, Alex," he said immediately, looking disgusted with 
himself. He picked the pieces 
from the floor of the research station's day room. 

" You've been out here too 
long," said Alex, putting the 
chessmen in their box. 

"Yeah," Sam agreed. "It's not 
the company — it's the year between supply ships. We're compatible enough; our pre-tests ran 
enough alike for us to have been 
twins, almost. But I get damned 
tired of seeing nothing but your 
ugly face and those four laboratory walls," 

"And the rolling pin," added 
Alex, whose pleasant face was 
long and high-boned, with a carefully tended mustache. "Rolling 
that hunk of steel over the rock 
specimens day after day. I've 
never really been convinced that 
it can't be done electrically, in a 
crusher. I think they want us to 
do it by hand so we'll earn our 
pay, maybe also to keep us too 
busy to think." 

"It's the hand and the eye, 
Alex. The hand is slower than the 
eye, no matter what magicians 
say. and we could spot the particles. If we mashed everything up 
in a crusher, the stuff we're after 
would get sluiced away with the 
rock powder and we'd never see 
it." 

"Assuming it's there to be 
seen." 

"They wouldn't have sent us 
and our fat salaries out to this 
asteroid if there weren't a damn 



good possibility of finding the 
stuff. So I guess we'll just have to 
go on pounding." 

"And sneezing at the dust," 
added Alex. 

"And going nuts," said Sam. 

Ninety-ninth Day 
^pHEY weren't entirely alone on 
-■- the asteroid. There was a native form of sub-life that the first 
explorers had discovered. But it 
was mostly dormant and didn't 
live on the surface. It consisted 
of si ate -colored, unicellular hunks 
of stuff, as Alex described them, 
which moved around at point 
zero one miles per hour. They 
lived deep down in what either 
were natural tunnels or passageways they dug for themselves. 

They seemed to live on something in the rock; it was possible 
that they dug the tunnels not so 
much to travel where it was they 
wanted to go as to get nourishment. The hunks of stuff — they 
were about the size of a thumbnail — were so close in color to the 
rocks they lived in, and on, that 
they were nearly invisible. 

Sam and Alex had been told 
about them, that they were harmless, and had named them vizzies, 
for invisibles. They were as much 
company on their dull world as 
microbes on Earth. 

"Check," said Alex Hurd. It 
was the inevitable chess game. 

"You fell into the trap." said 




 



Sam Black, without enthusiasm. 
"Check yourself. I take the knight 
with my bishop and it's mate in 
two moves.** 

Alex studied the board and 
shrugged indifferently. "All right, 
you win. I'm getting careless. I'm 
tired. I want to go home. I want 
to see grass again, and trees. I 
hate rocks. I don't think we're 
doing anything important. I want 
to go back where the Sun comes 
up only once a day instead of 
every hour." 

"Home is alwayc »ice when 
you're somewhere else," Sam said, 
his brown eyes far away. "But I 
wonder if it's home we miss as 
much as activity. If only something would happen here, the 
place wouldn't be so hard to take. 
But nothing ever happens. We 
crush rock. We test particles. We 
find nothing. We crush more 
rock. We don't even know what 
they'll use the stuff foY if we ever 
find it. 

"We send out the rocket. It 
takes pictures and beeps its way 
around this dead old watermelon 
and the pictures never show anything and the beep tone never 
discovers anything we didn't 
know was there in the first place. 
If only something would happen 
■ — anything! I don't give a damn 
if it's good or bad, just so it happens." 

Sam had put the chess pieces 
away and now he made out their 



report to Base. The message went 
out once a day — once every Earth 
day, that was; not every monotonous time the oblong asteroid 
that wai their temporary world 
made a wobbly revolution on its 
axis. 

Sam's leathery jaw tightened 
in distaste as he punched out the 
daily report. It consisted of four 
words, which hadn't varied in the 
three months, Earth reckoning, 
that they'd been at the station. 

The words were: "AH well. 
Progress nil." 

It was the "progress nil" which 
got them down as much as any 
of the other things, such as their 
work being so secret that they 
had no inkling of how their particular research fitted into the Big 
Picture. 

Their own work was the Little 
Picture, and it was a serial movie 
with interminable chapters. It 
was at this point in the dull 
drama that they began to wonder if they'd ever see the final 
installment, or whether they'd 
hand over their rock rollers to 
their successors at the end of 
their hitch without ever having 
known what it was all about. 

"Progress nil." If they had 
anything at all to report, or even 
if the wording were different so * 
k didn't sound so futile, their 
paid exile might have seemed less 
frustrating. 

"Let me have the report," said 



 



129 



Alex. "I'm going to do something." 

"What, for instance?" 

"You'll see." 

Alex took the blank. He crossed 
out the word "nil" with an angry 
motion of his pen, scratched his 
mustache reflectively, and then 
wrote busily for a minute. He 
handed the sheet back to Sam. 

It now read: 

"All well. Progress . . . Break 
for urgent. S.O.S. Research Station Nineteen. Attack on station 
by alien life-form from coordinates zero four eight x two 
seven. Request patrol craft blast 
spot as own armament ineffectual." 

Sam read the message. "You're 
nuts," he said. 

"I know it. Nuts from the monotony. Something's got to give 
and I don't want it to be me or 
you. We need a little excitement; 
you said so yourself." 

"I was only talking. A gripe 
is a gripe, but sending out a false 
alarm — " He crumpled the message and tossed it away. 

"Don't do that." Alex picked 
it up and smoothed it out. "We'll 
make it plausible. We'll blow up 
a couple of pieces of old junk 
near the station and send a few 
shells over. Set the stage, you 
know. The patrol will come and 
blast away and then the crew will 
come in and talk about it and 
we'll have a good story for them 



and they'll stick around a while 
and we'll have new faces for a 
change and — " 

Sam got up and paced around 
the small room. His serious face 
was pulled into a frown. 

"We can't do it, Alex. It 
wouldn't be right. They'd find 
out it was a fake and we'd be 
kicked out in disgrace. What kind 
of menace could we whip up that 
would fool them? Not that we're 
going to, but just for argument's 
sake." He grinned, his eyes lighting with interest for once. "At 
least we can talk about it. It's 
better than chess." 

"Good man," said Alex. "Of 
course, we won't do it if you don't 
think we can get away with it, 
or," he added hurriedly, "if you 
don't think it's right, Sam. But 
here's the way it could be. We 
could make the menace a stray 
explorer ship from Jupiter. Got 
off course, say, and landed here, 
thinking this was one of the 
asteroids in its own protectorate, 
instead of Earth's or Mars*. Mistaken identity, see? We send a 
message telling them to get off. 
Maybe the message is a little hot 
under the collar and they take 
offense — sling a shot at us. We 
fire back. Then they start shooting in earnest. We send the S.O.S. 
The patrol ship sends out one of 
its oblivion bombs. The patrol 
can't see the target, but it has the 
coordinates we gave them, and. 



130 




 



of course, after the explosion 
there's nothing left of the explorer from Jupiter." 

"It stinks," Sam grunted in disgust. "If that's the way your 
mind works, no wonder you're 
such a dud at chess. Look, we've 
got to work with what we have. 
You can't queen a pawn till you 
get it in the back row. No pirate 
ships or interplanetary monsters 
or any such baloney. We'll use 
the vizzies. All of a sudden, see, 
they come up out of the ground. 
It's a periodic migration or something of the sort; you know, like 
the birds going South, only not 
so often. They stop being just 
little hunks of stuff and join up 
into a real, plausible menace. Get 
it?" 

"Yeah," Alex replied, dazzled. 
"That's better than my idea any 
day." 

Hundredth Day 
rpHEY had sent out the fake 
distress signal, in a revised 
version, after twenty-four hours 
of preparation. 

"I must be crazy," said Sam. 
"How did I ever let you talk me 
into this ridiculous situation? 
Let's cancel it — say we were 
drunk or delirious." 

"We can't back out now, Sam.** 
Alex's eyes were alive with excitement. "Look, here comes an 
answer now. We're in business." 

Sam read it. "The patrol craft. 



Coming at full speed from — 
God, it's a long way off! I hope 
the vizzies don't get us first." 

"That's the spirit!" cried Alex. 
"Put yourself in the frame of 
mind and we'll be all right. Just 
picture it — the vizzies massed in 
tight Z formation, eating everything in their path, moving inexorably in our direction, as if 
they scent and resent us. The 
suspense is terrible. Will the patrol craft get here in time? Will 
the oblivion bomb have any effect? Will the brave researchers 
survive the creeping horde or will 
help arrive too late and find only 
human bones picked clean? Or 
will the bones, too, be consumed? 
Isn't it terrific? I feel like a kid 
at a football game again." 

"But you look like a mad 
scientist." Sam was smiling now, 
caught up in Alex's infectious enthusiasm. His broad face was 
aglow. "Maybe you are crazy." 

"Sure I'm crazy. So are you. 
But it's only temporary. This'll 
jjut us back on keel and we'll be 
able to stand it again for a while." 

"Wait a minute," Sam said. 
"We forgot something. If the vizzies were attacking, wouldn't we 
have the photo rocket out taking 
pictures? The investigators are 
going to want to see the films." 

"You're right," agreed Alex. 
"And we will show them a film, 
only they won't see a thing — just 
the landscape under infra-red. 



 



131 



The vizzies are invisible. Right? 
Well, they blend so well with the 
slate that no one could see them 
from that altitude. And I've 
faked some beeps on the electronic probe, so we're safe there, 
too." 

Another message came from 
the patrol craft. It had streaked 
a vast distance since its last communication and was urging the 
men on the asteroid to hold on 
if they could. 

Sam radioed back that time 
seemed to be favoring the defenders. They had lobbed a few 
shells, he said, but the old-fashioned explosives were having no 
effect. The vizzies were moving 
so slowly, however, that it would 
be several hours before they 
could reach the station. At Alex's 
suggestion, he explained that they 
were plotting the vizzies" position 
electronically and repeated the 
coordinates they had given earlier. 

Half an hour later, the patrol 
craft hove into missile range, although not into sight, and advised that it was ready to launch 
a rocket with an oblivion-bomb 
warhead. The hoaxters on the 
asteroid corrected the coordinates 
to move the mythical horde a 
few yards nearer the research station; then they radioed that it 
was okay to fire. 

The station shuddered and 
rocked on its deep foundations 



as the o-bomb exploded nearly 
twenty miles away. The plotters 
sent out the photo rocket to take 
pictures. It came back with a 
him that showed an o-bomb 
crater a quarter of a mile across 
and a collection of beep tones 
that recorded a lot of radioactivity, but no vizzies. 

Soon afterward, the patrol 
craft streaked across the starfilled sky and radioed for permission to land. 

"Break out the clean tablecloth !" said Alex. "Company's 
coming!'* 

Hundred and First Day 
" T\0 you think they suspect 
anything?" asked Sam. 
"They turn up their noses at our 
accommodations, they bunk and 
eat in their own ship, they roam 
around the rock as thick as berrypickers and they ask more questions than a five-year-old." 

"It's routine," said Alex unworriedly. "They have to make a 
report. Be thankful we don't have 
to. The skipper said we could 
have a copy of theirs to send on. 
to Base. Have you run into any 
of the re porters ? That's wh ere 
we'll have to watch our step." 

"I saw the press rocket land, 
but nobody's been around yet.** 

The buzzer sounded. A lean, 
tow-headed young man came in 
through the airlock, took off his 
gear and introduced himself as 



193 




 



Kirsten of Galactic News. 

"Gentlemen," he said, "I assume you are the outcasts. Two 
of the far-flung researchers of 
the Exploration and Assessment 
Commission. If you are, and you 
must be, I greet you cordially 
and invite you to share with mc 
this precious bottle. I offer it in 
the knowledge that if I were you, 
and if I had been here three 
months, I'd have drunk up every 
drop I npght have brought with 
me against the possibility of 
snake-bite — or, in this particular 
case, vizzie-bite. Do I hear anyone decline?" 

"You hear nothing of the sort," 
said Alex. "What you hear is me 
getting three glasses. I'm Alex 
Hurd; this is Sam Black." 

"Delighted, gentlemen," said 
Kirsten. "The beauty of vizziebite, as I understand it, is {hat 
the critter can't be seen with the 
naked eye and that you are therefore unable to be absolutely certain whether you have received 
the mortal sting. And so you go 
to the medicinal licker — I beg 
your pardon, locker — according 
to schedule, as a precaution 
against the dread possibility of 
being a vizzie victim. Am I correct?" 

"Do you always talk this 
way?" asked Sam. 

"I talk the way I write, and 1 
am a feature writer," said Kirsten. "For the other fellow, the 



dross of cold fact, the colorless 
statistic ; for me. the del k ate 
fabric of embroidery, the phrase 
which recreates the scene in vivid 
life, the sentence which tugs at 
the heartstring and calls forth the 
tear, or evokes the smile of true 
understanding." 

"Yeah, you do that, all right,** 
Alex admitted. 

The reporter sat down and 
poured three drinks from a halffull bottle. 

"I have already been at it,*" 
said Kirsten, "as y6u will observe. I drink; it is my curse and 
my sorrow. But it is also my need 
and my joy. My editor often has 
said to me, 'Randy, you are one 
of the few who give the press 
corps a bad name. You are a 
lush. Randy, and your habit undoes the good impression madeby the majority of the men of 
the press, who arc sober men and 
faithful to their wives. But you 
are a writer. Randy, who has a 
way with words,' said my editor, 
'and the way you have is such 
that you would be snapped up 
instanter by the opposition if I 
fired you, and that is why I have 
refrained from giving you the 
sack.' This is more or less what 
my editor often has said to me, 
and I repeat it to you by way of 
explanation should you think me 
unduly casual concerning what 
conceivably was a marrow-chilling experience." 



 



Sam and Alex left their drinks 
untasted as they listened in admiration. 

"This is as good as a floor 
show," said Alex. 

"Better," said the reporter, unperturbed. "And there's absolutely no charge. Now, would 
one of you be so good as to describe your sensations for my 
stenographic ear? I will take no 
notes, but the polished substance 
of what you relate soon will be 
broadcast throughout the Solar 
System." 

Kirsten tilted his chair back 
and looked expectantly from one 
to the other with his alert eyes. 

They drank and talked. Alex 
carried the burden of the conversation for the pair, although 
Sam occasionally put in a word 
of further explanation. He also 
gave Alex a kick once or twice 
when he thought his partner was 
embroidering the fabric of their 
yarn too much, instead of letting 
Kirsten devise his own ways to 
tug at the heartstring. 

They had barely killed the bottle when other reporters arrived. 
They dropped their gear on the 
floor and took out pocket-size 
stenotypers. Alex repeated their 
story for the latecomers' benefit 
and some fresh bottles were 
opened up. At intervals, reporters 
went out to file stories. Kirsten 
among them. But they came back 
and, their work finished, settled 



down to have a party. 

Crew members from the patrol 
ship joined the festivities in the 
researchers' dayroom, but the 
skipper remained aloof. 

**Chess, anyone?" asked Alex, 
but it was a deck of cards he 
produced. 

They played poker, drank, told 
stories and sang space ballads 
until the skipper came in to get 
Alex's and Sam's signatures on a 
statement and announce that his 
ship would be leaving in an hour. 

The mission was completed. 
The skipper and the head of his 
investigation unit apparently 
were satisfied that the vizzie menace was ended. 

The reporters had asked some 
astute questions, considering that 
they were laymen, but the plotters saw no hint of suspicion anywhere. They were jubilant. Their 
hoax had been a terrific success. 
They'd had their excitement. 
They'd had a lot of flattering 
attention. And they'd had a 
party. 

Hundred and Forty-third Day 




LEX said : "Let's have a 
party." 



"What?" said Sam. He was 
trimming a beard he had started 
to grow six weeks earlier. 

"A party," repeated Alex. "I'm 
getting bored again. 1 think it's 
time for another vizzie menace." 

"Nothing doing." 



134 




 



M Aw, please, Sam." 

"No." He snipped carefully at 
the short whiskers. 

**■ 'No' or 'not yet'?" asked Alex. 

"No," said Sam firmly. But 
then he added : "Well, not yet." 

Hundred and Seventy-sixth Day 
"V7"OU know," said Alex wistfully, "that was awfully good 
liquor Kirsten had." 

"Who?" Sam's beard was quite 
full now. He combed it luxuriously. 

"Kirsten, the reporter, that 
time we hoaxed them. Let's hoax 
them again, Sam. I could sure 
use some poker. I think if I play 
another game of chess, with you 
pulling away at that damn beaver 
you've worked up. I'll really go 
nuts. I feel like a pawn of fate, 
cast out into the void, left to be 
advanced one square at a time to 
my doom of ennui." 

"Doom of what?" asked Sam, 
halting the comb. 

"Ennui. Boredom." 

"Just because you liked Kirsten's liquor, you don't have to 
start talking like him." 

"I have a feeling I'm going to 
sound a, lot worse pretty soon, if 
something doesn't happen. Then 
you'll be cooped up on this piece 
of nothing with a raving lunatic 
— maybe one with a beard phobia. You'll have to lock me up 
and roll all those rocks by yourself, and it'll take you twice as 



long to get no place with this 
damn fool research as it doe* 
now. Sam, let's have a party. 
Let's make the vizzies march." 
Sam said : "Well . . " 

Hundred and Eightieth Day] 
rpHE little spaceport on the 
asteroid was chockful of official craft. The patrol ship was 
there, an all-white vessel from 
World Government, two press 
ships this time, and a cumbersome-looking craft with cranes 
poking out of it. 

The boys had cried wolf again, 
and this time they got more of a 
party than they had bargained 
for. The patrol ship had loosed 
another a- bomb. O- bombs were 
expensive. There was a second 
quarter-mile crater near the first 
and again there was no sign of a 
horde of vizzies. This was only 
natural, the hoaxters pointed out, 
because the o-bomb had obliterated them. But the skipper was 
not convinced. 

Not this time. 

He grilled Alex Hurd and Sam 
Black for two hours, then turned 
them over to his investigating officer, who grilled them some 
more. By then a World Government ship had arrived with a 
subcommissioner from the Exploration and Assessment Commission. The two researchers 
didn't dare back down now. and 
wearily they repeated their re


 



131 



hearsed story once more. 

W. G. summoned an explorer 
ship and it came and poked its 
bores deep into the bowels of the 
asteroid. It lumbered here and 
there, as night and day chased 
themselves hourly around the 
tiny world, beeping electronically 
into the o-bomb craters, scooping up monstrous shovelfuls of 
ilatc and assaying them for signs 
of vizzies alive, vizzies dead, or 
vizzies disintegrated. 

Then the reporters were allowed to see the two men. They 
came without liquor this time, 
but with broad grins and clever 
remarks. Sam and Alex squirmed 
through the interview. They stuck 
to their story, trying to pretend 
they didn't hear the cracks about 
the Moon hoax and the Cardiff 
giant, and repeating again and 
again their invented description 
of how the vizzies had attacked 
in Z formation, until they grew 
utterly sick of the ridiculous 
word vi2zies — the reporters loved 
it — and their once-plausible 
story. 

Kirstcn was the worst of them. 
With his mock sympathy and 
his feigned seriousness, he almost 
trapped them a few times, but 
they wriggled out somehow. 

The reporters finally left them 
alone and they collapsed on their 
bunks. 

"Sam — " began Alex tentatively. 



"Shut up." said Sam. 

Kirsten dictated a story to Galactic News: 

"By Randy Kirstcn, Staff Correspondent. 

"There is some doubt today 
whether a tiny creature of primitive life, known to the trade as a 
vizzie (repeat vizzie, spelled 
v-i-doublc z-i-e), is as man-eating in its mealtime habits as two 
young scientists seem to fear. The 
native habitat of the vizzie is a 
forlorn asteroid somewhere beyond Mars which also is populated, temporarily, by the two 
young men. 

"Their job is a secret one. It is 
also dull, and it was with great 
excitement that they fell heir to 
what they described as an imminent vizzie invasion of their own 
little half-acre nearly three 
months ago. The space patrol 
nipped that vizzie menace in the 
bud, according to the record, on 
which doubt has now been cast. 

"But yesterday the alarm again 
went out from Asteroid X that 
the vizzies once more were on the 
march . , ." 

And so on. from Kirsten, for 
three thousand words. 

Hundred and Ninety-fifth Day 
"Vf/E shouldn't have used that 
part about the Z formation." said Alex Hurd. "That's 
what sounded silliest of all." 
"I've just succeeded in push


 



ing the whole brainless stunt into 
my subconscious," S:iin Black 
said. "Til thank you to leave it 
there." 

"I didn't bring up the subject. 
Base did. This message just arrived." 

Sam took it. "Are wc fired?" 

"No. Just admonished. Pretty 
sarcastic, too, for an official document." 

The message, from their chief, 
pointed out the cost of two oblivion bombs, the cost of twice 
diverting a patrol ship from its 
normal course, the cost of sending an c x plor a t i on vessel to a 
remote asteroid which previously 
had been explored to everyone's 
satisfaction, the personal cost to 
him, the chief, in aggravation, 
and the cost to the Commission 
in prestige as a result of the sly 
news stories which had appeared 
after the second "problt "inatical" 
vizzie attack, as he termed it. 

It must be assumed, he went 
on, that there really was danger, 
inasmuch as there was no proof 
to the contrary. This assumption, 
hi said, must be the oflicuil vi rsion and, for its own sake, not 
theirs, the Commission must accept it and defend it wlu never 
the matter might be referred to 
in the future. 

But, the chief's message added, 
it was also true that there was no 
evidence to back up tire researchers* story and he privately felt 



that the vizzie menace was a 
myth. Any subsequent deviation 
from routine without factual 
foundation, he warned, would be 
dealt with most harshly. 

"Kile it," said Sam. "File it 
and remember it." 

Two Hundred and Seventeenth 
Day 

"HpHE rocket's back," announced Sain. 

"Let's skip it this time. Watching tli3t film always puts me to 
sleep, anyway." 

"Come on. It's got to be done." 

They got into their spacesuits 
and went out to the landing rack 
to see how the rocket had made 
out this time. 

"Missed again," said Alex. "I'll 
git the tractor." 

He lumbered out to the rocket 
in the lialf-track and hauled it 
back. He took out the film pack 
and th< y went indoors to run it 
on the projector. 

"Let it roll," said Alex. "I'm 
ready to hiss the villain." 

The projector reeled off the 
routine circumnavigation of the 
asteroid as it would have appeared to a pilot if there had 
been one aboard the guided 
rocket. It was dull, as usual, 
watching the unending vista of 
gray slate— punctuated now by 
two o-bomb craters — and listening to the accompanying electronic beeps. 



US 



CAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



But then, as the film was ending, the beep device went crazy. 
It began to chatter, to whine. 
Then it keened up into inaudibility. 

Alex, who had been curled in 
his seat, watching and listening 
automatically, shot upright. 

"Creeping beepers!" he shouted. 
"What's that?" 

Sam stopped the projector. 
Tensely, he spun it back a hundred feet and re-ran the film from 
there. 

As the beep tone began to chatter again, the film showed a flat 
plain which they recognized as 
being some miles west of them 
on the simulated compass. There 
was nothing visible on the plain — not from the height at which the 
photo rocket had taken the pictures — but the chatter became a 
whine as the flat land sped by. 

The beep tone began keening 
as the craft sped toward a sheer 
cliff. The cliff was the edge of a 
plateau atop which the research 
station was built. The beep device went into its silence of supersound just before the rocket 
passed over the cliff. The normal 
beep tone then returned and continued until the landing, when 
the film ended. 

A magnification qf the film 
strip showed nothing. The ground 
which had been photographed 
was flat, rocky and devoid of 
even plant life. 



Working backward, the men 
found that the beep tone started 
acting up at the point where the 
film showed a small crater, not 
one of those made by the 
o-bombs. The crater had showed 
up on previous films, but it never 
seemed to mean anything except 
possibly that a meteor had struck 
there long ago. That was what it 
still looked like. 

"This is a job for Buster," Sam 
decided. 

Buster was their mechanical 
brain. He wasn't very bright, as 
such brains went, because there 
was no point in exiling one of the 
super-brains to a remote research 
station at a time when they were 
in great demand by Earth and 
the other developed planets. 

Buster was fed the film. He 
chewed on it for a while, getting 
it into its proper channel, swallowed it and then digested it to 
the accompaniment of clicks and 
burps. 

"Buster sure is a sloppy eater,'* 
Alex said, trying to cover up a 
case of nerves. "I hope this does 
not give him indigestion." 

After a while Buster disgorged 
the film, together with a printed 
Strip of paper. Sam grabbed it 
and compared the symbols on it 
with some "on a chart hanging 
from one of Buster's buttons. 

"I'll be damned!" 

"What is it, Sam?" 

"It's impossible. It couldn't 



 * A J ■ * 3 1 39 



happen. Not to us." 

"What, for God's sake?" 

"Buster says — this isn't fair! — 
he says the vizzies arc on the 
march." 

Alex looked at his bearded 
partner without comprehension. 
"I don't get it. What makes him 
think so?" 

"Buster doesn't think; he 
knows. You can work it back 
yourself. When those beeps 
turned into a whine, it meant 
something unusual. Even a kid 
knows that. Buster listened to the 
whine— or checked the impulses 
that caused the whine — and compared them with the impulses 
made by things we have records 
of. If he didn't know what they 
were, he would have said so. He 
didn't, which means he knows. He 
has a record of the impulse a 
vi2zie causes when a beep hits it. 
And he says the whine was' caused 
by a lot of vizzies, on the surisce. The whine got worse — more 
vizzies. Then it got supersonic. 
More vizzies than could be recorded at the threshold of sound, 
obviously." 

"It's impossible," Alex objected. 

"That's what I said. But I was 
wrong." 

"They're a hoax. They don't 
march. We made all that up. It 
was a gag!" 

"Well." said Sam. "it's, backfired on us." 



Two Hundred and Eighteenth 
Day 

THEY'D sent the rocket out 
again, switched to film and 
telecast so they would have a 
permanent record as well as an 
instantaneous picture of what 
was going on now. And they adjusted it for radar- telecast, now 
that they knew what they were 
looking for. One half of the screen 
showed them the scene under 
infra-red in the brief night — a 
desolate plain of cindery slate, 
ending at a cliff. Apparently 

nothing moved. 

But there on the other half of 
the screen, glowing in a mass that 
stretched along the base of the 
cliff and for as far back as could 
be seen, was an undulating sea of 
vizzies. 

"At least they're not in Z formation," Sam pointed out. 

"Ha, ha," said Alex in a flat 
voice. 

"Can you make out whether 
any of them are on the face of 
the cliff itself? Climbing up it?" 

"Wait till the rocket circles 
again. No, I can't tell. Can you 
see anything. Sam?" 

"Look! There goes a piece of 
the cliff. Crashing down as if — 
I'll bet that's it. Alex. They're 
eating away the base of the cliff. 
They cari'l go up it, so they're 
eating their way under it. Millions of , them— - billions!" 
, "Call , the patrol ship." said 




 



Alex. "At the rate they're going, 
they'll be here in a couple of 
days. There won't be any more 
plateau and our statio#*U go 
crashing down just like th« eliff." 

"Take it easy." suggested Sam. 
"The patrol ship wouldn't be 
anxious to come sec us a third 
time. Remember, we're the boys 
who cried wolf." 

"Sure, but there's the wolf! 
This time it's for real." 

"Real, yes," Sam told him. 
"But is it dangerous? We're still 
keyed up to that make-believe 
menace we created. I don't think 
we're being entirely logical about 
this situation." 

"Okay. Ten minutes out for 
logic. I vote for calling the ship 
and an o-bomb and taking our 
chances with their ridicule. But 
maybe you can make me change 
my mind." 

"This gives us a chance to get 
out of the doghouse. It couldn't 
be more perfect. If we can wrap 
up this situation ourselves, we'll 
be the fair-haired boys again, instead of a couple of rock-happy 
bats.** 

They dug into old records at 
the station. They measured the 
length and width of the vizzie 
horde and its depth. They found 
that the creatures were eating 
vertically into the surface of the 
plain as well as forward. They 
sent the photo-rocket out on a 
shuttle basis, set to both telecast 



and film. They peered at the 
video screen and examined the 
film. They satisfied themselves 
that the plateau, with its sheer 
cliffs, was a natural, if temporary, 
barrier to the horde. They computed the rate at which the 
plateau was being eaten away 
and found that they had a comfortable span of time in which to 
make preparations. 

Night gave way to day. 

From the old records they 
learned that the vizzies had never 
been run through a laboratory. 
The early explorers had satisfied 
themselves that the creatures 
were subterranean dwellers and 
had sounded them out with oldfashioned oscilloscopes to get a 
few basic facts about them. Then, 
convinced that they were useless 
and harmless, they had ignored 
the vizzies. They hadn't even 
named them. 

There were some reports that 
the creatures made an occasional 
pilgrimage to the surface — "I 
must have half-remembered that 
when I was concocting our yarn," 
said Sam — but the reports had 
been undocumented and were 
put down to legend. There was 
no official record of such a visitation having occurred. 

Until now. 

ALEX attached a grapple to 
the pilotless rocket and sent 
it out to get some samples. They 



 



141 



watched on the screen as the craft 
dipped low and scooped up a 
bucketful at the end of a cable. 
When these were fetched to them, 
the researchers cautiously transferred the vizzies, by remote-control handlers, to a huge copper 
tank. Their slate color showed up 
well against the bright copper 
and the men watched as the creatures boiled around in the bottom of «h\ 

The short day of the asteroid 
waned. The fleeting dusk became 
night as successive tests showed 
that the tiny vizzies had no taste 
for copper, iron, steel, lead, zinc, 
or any other metal or alloy of 
metal. But when rock or slate 
was dropped into a container with 
the creatures, it was gobbled 'up 
in a twinkling. 

"At the rate they eat," said 
Alex, "you'd think they'd have 
gorged their way clear through 
the asteroid by now." 

"Unless," suggested Sam, "they 
have only a short feeding season 
—which is what this must be— 
and they spend the rest of the 
time back underground, digesting." 

But this question was academic. The problem was how to 
stop the horde from crunching 
into the Cliff face and causing avalanches which eventually 
would undermine their plateautop research station. It wasn't 
only a question of keeping the 



vizzies from overrunning the 
place; they had to be kept from 
collapsing it from underneath. 

The problem had answered itself, in part, the next time the 
unmanned rocket flew over the 
horde. Continuing rock falls had 
transformed the plateau edge 
from a sheer cliff to a slope — a 
slope the vizzies were capable 
of climbing. And up they were 
coming, clearly shown in the 
image on the radar screen. 

Sam tugged thoughtfully at 
his beard and Alex chewed on 
the end of a mustache which had 
become scraggly, while they 
watched the vizzies glitter their 
eerie way to the summit. 

"Look," said Alex, "couldn't 
we fence in the station with 
metal? It'd take a lot of fence, 
but we could do it. Then, even 
if they ate around us, we'd still 
be standing on solid ground." 

"If you're thinking of the cyclone fencing we have in the 
warehouse," Sam pointed out, 
"you're thinking the wrong think. 
Metal doesn't repel them; they 
just don't like the taste of it. And 
the holes in a cyclone fence are 
plenty big enough for them to 
crawl through to get to the rock 
on the other side. Then they'd 
eat the foundations right out 
from under us." 

"Yeah," said Alex. "That's a 
fact." 

He sat down and thought hard.

He got up and ran the latest films 
from the rocket through the projector. As he studied them, worrying his mustache with his teeth, 
he brightened. 

"Now I have got it!" 

A LEX snatched up a portable 
searchlight and his gear and 
dashed out into the airlock. 

Sam hammered on the door, 
then clambered into his own gear 
and went out through the second 
airlock. He chased after Alex 
through the starry night. 

"Wait, you crazy nut!" he 
yelled. 

He caught up with Alex near 
the edge of the plateau. By now 
the vizzies had reached the top 
and were moving forward with 
barely perceptible speed. 

Alex fingered the controls on 
his gravity belt and - soared a 
dozen feet into the airless sky, 
then nudged himself forward until he was above the horde. He 
played his searchlight down on 
the vizzies, first at one angle, then 
another. 

The creatures were brightly 
visible, now that the men were 
so close to them. They continued 
to move forward. Sam stepped 
back and shouted at Ale*. His 
voice was tinny in the transmitter. 

"Get down from there, you 
dope! What happens if you fall 
in?" 



"You might have to play solo 
chess," Alex replied placidly. 
"But don't worry. I think I've 
got them licked. Are they still 
moving?" 

"Helt, yes!" cried Sam. Involuntarily, he stepped back another 
couple of feet. "If anything, 
they're moving faster." 

"Good," said Alex from up in 
the air ''Now we'll see." 

He dipped into a shallow dive 
and landed neatly beside Sam. 

"Watch," he said. 

Ale* squatted, only inches 
from the vanguard of the vizzie 
plague, and shone bis torch directly at it. 

The creatures were stopping! 

Moreover, they were retreating y 
as the powerful light continued 
to play directly on them from 
the front. 

"Come on," said Alex. "That's 
the answer." 

The men went back to their 
station and turned on all the 
lights, letting them shine through 
the broad glass windows on the 
slate surrounding the buildings. 
A battery of searchlights set low 
at strategic spats completed their 
defenses. 

"It clicked all of a sudden," 
Alex said. "We're east of the 
horde and they moved so slowly 
it was hard to tell. But for a few 
minutes, when the Sun rose, it 
was shining directly in their eyes, 
so to speak. It stopped them — 



 



14J 



but only for as long as the Sun 
was on the horizon. After that, 
the shell of their backs gave them 
protection and they came on 
again. * 

"And remember when we had 
those test vizzies in the copper 
pot in the lab?" asked Alex. "You 
saw how they went boiling 
around in it. They not only don't 
like horizontal light — they can't 
stand it. The light above the pot 
reflected on them from the shiny 
copper inside at all angles. It was 
too much for them." 

When the time came for the 
men to send their daily report, the 
vizzies were swarming outside 
the station. It was entirely sur


rounded, but the creatures kept 
well beyond the shining circle of 
light. 

The message to Base consisted 
of only four words: 

"All well. Progress nil.'* 

Two Hundred and Nineteenth 
Day 

THEY don't like animal flesh 
or cloth or rubber, either," 
said Alex. "So even if my light 
hadn't stopped them, I'd have 
been perfectly safe among them, 
out there." 

"You didn't know that until 
today, though," Sam objected. 
"What else do the tests show?" 
"That's all so far, Sam. Except

Hi 



lines of Alex's palm to the pebble 
and wrapped itself around it. The 
pebble vanished. Alex put another bit of rock on the opposite 
side of his palm and the vizzie 
wriggled toward it. That, too, disappeared. 

Sam watched the performance 
with an expression of revulsion. 
But the expression changed. 

"Alex!" he yelled. "Look! It 
didn't eat all the pebble. See 
what's left?" 

"Where?" Alex examined his 
palm frowningly. "I don't see 
anything." 

"The light has to hit it just 
right, it's so tiny — just a speck!" 

Alex saw it now, too. But he 
said: "What of it? My vizzie's a 
fastidious eater. Likes to leave a 
little something on the plate." 

"Let me test it," said Sam. 
"Just on a hunch." , 

And., of course, that was it. 

THE appetite of a vizzie led 
them to what they had been 
looking for in the slate rock — 
the rock they'd pounded and 
rolled in vain for seven months. 
They'd been unable to see the 
rare earth because it was in so 
minute a ratio to the rock itself. 

"What dumb luck!" Sam exulted. "The stuff turns out to be 
the one part of the slate the vizzie doesn't like — an infinitesimal 
bit of mineral. So small we could 
have gone on pounding rock till 



Doomsday without seeing it. 
Think how many pounds of the 
stuff we must have sluiced away, 
never knowing it was there!" 

"Sweet little vizzie." Alex 
scratched the back of the creature 
in his palm. "I'm going to get 
you a whole boulder to nibble 
on to your heart's content." 

"It is kind of cute at that, isn't 
it?" remarked Sam. He grinned. 
"Do you know what this means, 
Alex? Do you get the whole picture?" 

"Sure," said Alex solemnly. "It 
means we'll have to catch a whole 
mess of vizzies and feed them 
rock, and then gather up their 
leavings. And I was afraid I'd 
have to do it all by myself because I thought you'd become a 
vizziephobe." 

"You blathering moron! It 
means that every bit of ground 
the vizzies have eaten their way 
across is already panned for us. 
The plain, the cliff, the plateau — 
even our front yard. All we have 
to do to get the mineral is go out 
and scoop it up." 

"Well, sure," Alex said. "That's 
fine, of course. But that means no 
more crushing and picking rock, 
which "means even more time to 
go batty." 

"What have you got in mind?" 
Sam asked suspiciously. 

Alex looked wistful. "I wish we 
could have another party."
