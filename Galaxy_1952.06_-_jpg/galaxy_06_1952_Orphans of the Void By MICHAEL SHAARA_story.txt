Orphans of the Void By MICHAEL SHAARA 

IN the region of the Coal Sack 
Nebula, on the dead fourth 
planet of a star called Tyban, Captain Stiffens of the Mapping Command stood counting 
buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He 
wondered if there was any significance in the number. He had no 
idea. 

"What do you make of it?" he 
asked. 



Lieutenant Ball, the executive 
officer of the ship, almost tried to 
scratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing, a 
spacesuit. 

"Looks like a temporary 
camp," Ball said. "Very few 
buildings, and all built out of 
native materials, the only stuff 
available. Castaways, maybe?" 
Steffens was silent as he walked 



 



up onto the rise. The flat weathered stone jutted out of the sand 
before him. 

"No inscriptions," he pointed 
out. 

"They would have been worn 
away. See the wind grooves? 
Anyway, there's not another 
building on the whole damn 
planet. You wouldn't call it much 
of a civilization," 

"You don't think these are native?" 

Ball said he didn't. Steffens 
nodded. 

Standing there and gazing at 
the stone, Steffens felt the awe 
of great age. He had a hunch, 
deep and intuitive, that this was 
old — too old. He reached out a 
gloved hand, ran it gently over 
the smooth stone ridges of the 
wall. Although the atmosphere 
was very thin, he noticed that 
the buildings had no airlocks. 

Ball's voice sounded in his 
helmet: "Want to set up shop, 
Skipper?" 

Steffens paused. "All right, if 
you think it will do any good." 

"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. 
These things are on a raised rock 
foundation, swept clean by the 
wind. And you can see that the 
rock itself is native — " he indicated the ledge beneath their feet 
— "and was cut out a long while 
back." 

"How long?** 



Ball toed the sand uncomfortably. "I wouldn't like to say offhand." 

"Make a rough estimate." 

Ball looked at the captain, 
knowing what was in his mind. 
He smiled wryly and said: "Five 
thousand years? Ten thousand? I 
don't know." 

Steffens whistled. 

Ball pointed again at the wall. 
"Look at the striations. You can 
tell from that atone. It would 
take even a brisk Earth wind at 
leant several thousand years to 
cut that deep, and fhe wind here 
has only a fraction of that force." 

The two men stood for a long 
moment in silence. Man had been 
in interstellar space for three 
hundred years and this was the 
first uncovered evidence of an 
advanced, space-crossing, alien 
race. It was an historic moment, 
but neither of them was thinking 
about history. 

Man had been in space for only 
three hundred years. Whateverhad built these had been in space 
for thousands of years. 

Which ought to give them, 
thought Steffens uncomfortably, 
one hell of a good head-start. 

WHILE the excav crew 
worked steadily, turning up 
nothing, Steffens remained alone 
among the buildings. Ball came 
out to him, looked dryly at the 
walls. 




 



"Well," he said, "whoever they 
were, we haven't heard from 
them since." 

*'No? How can you be sure?" 
Steffens grunted. "A space-borne 
race was roaming this part of the 
Galaxy while men were still 
pitching spears at each other, that 
long ago. And this planet is only 
a parsec from Variul It, a civilization as old as Earth's. Did whoever built these get to Varius? Or 
did they get to Earth? How can 
you know?" 

He kicked at the sand distractedly. "And most important, 
where are they now? A race with 
several thousand years . . ." 

"Fifteen thousand," Ball said. 
When Steffens looked up, he 
added: "That's what the geology 
boys say. Fifteen thousand, at the 
least." 

Steffens turned to stare unhappily at the buildings. When 
he realized now how really old 
they were, a sudden thought 
'struck him. 

"But why buildings? Why did 
they have to build in stone, to 
last? There's something wrong 
with that. They shouldn't have 
had a need to build, unless they 
were castaways. And castaways 
would have left something behind. The only reason they would 
need a camp would be — " 

"If the ship left and some of 
them stayed." 

Steffens nodded. "But then the 



ship must have come back. Where 
did it go?" He ceased kicking at 
the sand and looked up into the 
blue-black midday sky. "We'll 
never know." 

"How about the other planets?" Ball asked. 

"The report was negative Inner too hot, outer too heavy and 
cold. The third planet is the only 
one with a decent temperature 
range, but it has a CO- atmosphere." 

"How about moons?" 

Steffens shrugged. "We could 
try them and find out." • 

fpHE third planet was a blank, 
gleaming ball until they were 
in close, and then the blankness 
resolved into folds and piling 
clouds and dimly, in places, the 
surface showed through. The ship 
went down through the clouds, 
falling the last few miles on her 
brakers. They came into the misty gas below, leveled off and 
moved along the edge of the twilight zone. 

The moons of this solar system had yielded nothing. The 
third planet, a hot, heavy world 
which had no free oxygen and 
from which the monitors had detected nothing, was all that was 
left. Steffens expected nothing, 
but he had to try. 

At a height of several mites, 
the ship moved up the zone, 
scanning, moving in the familiar 



 



81 



slow spiral of the Mapping Command. «Faint dark outlines of bare 
rocks and hills moved by below. 

Steffens turned the screen to 
full magnification and watched 
silently. 

After a while he saw a city. 

The main screen being on, the 
whole crew saw it. Someone 
shouted and they stopped to 
stare, and Steffens was about to 
call for altitude when he saw 
that the city was dead. 

He looked down on splintered 
walls that were like cloudy glass 
pieces rising above^a plain, rising 
in a shattered circle. Near the 
center of the c;ty, there was a 
huge, charred hole at least three 
miles in diameter and very deep. 
In all the piled rubble, nothing 
moved. 

Steffens went down low to 
make sure, then brought the. ship 
around and headed out across the 
main continent into the bright 
area of the sun. The rocks rolled 
by below, there was no vegetation at all, and then there were 
more cities — all with the black 
depression, the circular stamp 
that blotted away and fused the 
buildings into nothing. 

No one on the ship had anything to say. None had ever seen 
a war, for there had not been 
war on Earth or near it for more 
than three hundred years. 

The ship circled around to the 
dark side of the planet. When 



they were down below a mile, the 
radiation counters began to react. It became apparent, from the 
dials, that there could be nothing 
alive. 

After a while Ball said: "Well, 
which do you figure? Did our 
friends from the fourth planet do 
this, or were they the same people 
as these?" 

Steffens did not take his eyes 
from the screen. They were coming around to the daylight side. 

"We'll go down and look for 
the answer," he said. "Break out 
the radiation suits." 

He paused, thinking. If the 
ones on the fourth planet were 
alien to this world, they were 
from outer space, could not have 
come from one of the other planets here. They had starships and 
were warlike. Then, thousands of 
years ago. He began to realize 
how important it really was that 
Ball's question be answered. 

When the ship had gone very 
low. looking for a landing site, 
Steffens was still by the screen. 
It was Steffens, then, who saw 
the thing move. 

Down far below, it had been 
a still black shadow, and then it 
moved. Steffens froze. And he 
knew, even at that distance, that 
it was a robot. 

Tiny and black, a mass of 
hanging arms and legs, the thing 
went gliding down the slope of a 
hill. Steffens saw it clearly for a 




 



full second, saw the dull ball of 
its head tilt upward as the ship 
came over, and then the hill was 
past. 

QUICKLY Steffens called for 
height. The ship bucked beneath him and blasted straight 
up; some of the crew went crashing to the deck. Steffens remained 
by the screen, increasing the magnification as the ship drew away. 
And he saw another, then two, 
then a black gliding group, all 
matched with bunches of hanging arms. 

Nothing alive but robots, he 
thought, robots. He adjusted to 
full close up as quickly as he 
could and the picture focused on 
the screen. Behind him he heard 
a crewman grunt in amazement. 

A band of clear, plasticlike stuff 
ran round the head — it would be 
the eye, a band of eye that saw 
all ways. On the top of the head 
was a single round spot of the 
plastic, and the rest was black 
metal, joined, he realized, with 
fantastic perfection. The angle of 
sight was now almost perpendicular. He could see very little of 
the branching arms of the trunk, 
but what had been on the screen 
was enough. They were the most 
perfect robots he had ever seen. 

The ship leveled off. Steffens 
had no idea what to do; the sudden sight of the moving things 
had unnerved him. He had al


ready sounded the alert, flicked 
out the defense screens. Now he 
had nothing to do. He tried to 
concentrate on what the League 
Law would have him do. 

The Law was no help. Contact with planet-bound races was 
forbidden under any circumstances. But could a bunch of 
robots be called a race? The Law 
said nothing about robots because 
Earthmen had none. The building of imaginative robots was expressly forbidden. But at any 
rate, Steffens thought, he had 
made contact already. 

While Steffens stood by the 
screen, completely bewildered for 
the first time in his space career. 
Lieutenant Ball came up, hobbling slightly. From the bright 
new bruise on his cheek, Steffens 
guessed that the sudden climb 
had caught him unaware. The 
exec was pale with surprise. 

"What were they?'* he said 
blankly. "Lord, they looked like 
robots!" 

"They were." 

Ball stared confoundedly at 
the screen. The things were now 
a confusion of dots in the mist. 

"Almost humanoid," Steffens 
said, "but not quite." 

Ball was slowly absorbing the 
situation. He turned to gaze inquiringly at Steffens. v 

"Well, what do we do now?" 

Steffens shrugged. "They saw 
us. We could leave now and let 



 



them quite possibly make a . . . 
a legend out of our visit, or we 
could go down and see if they tie 
in with the buildings on Tyban 
IV." 

"Can we go down?" 

''Legally? I don't know. If they 
are robots, yes, since robots cannot constitute a race. But there's 
another possibility." He tapped 
'lis fingers on the screen con*" Tusedly. *'They don't have to be 
robots at all. They could be the 
natives." 

Ball gulped. "I don't follow 
you." • 

"They could be the original inhabitants of this planet — the 
brains of them, at least, protected 
in radiation-proof metal. Anyway/' he added, "they're the most 
perfect mechanicals I've ever 
seen." 

Ball shook his head, sat down 
abruptly. Stefj'ens turned from the 
screen, strode nervously across 
the Main Deck, thinking. 

The Mapping Command, they 
called it. Theoretically, all he 
was supposed to do was make a 
closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking for the 
presence of life-forms as well as 
for the possibilities of human colonization. Make a check and 
nothing else. But he knew very 
clearly that if he returned to 
Sinus base without investigating 
this robot situation, he could very 
well be court-martialed one way 



or the other, either for breaking 
the Law of Contact or for dereliction of duty. 

And there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred 
to him, that the robots might well 
be prepared to blow his ship to 
hell and gone. 

, He stopped in the center of 
the deck. A whole new line of 
thought opened up. If the robots 
were armed and ready . . . could 
this be an outpost? 
An outpost! 

He turned and raced for the 
bridge. If he went in and landed 
and was lost, then the League 
might never know in time. If he 
went in and stirred up trouble . . . 

The thought in his mind was 
scattered suddenly, like a mist 
blown away. A voice was speaking in his mind, a deep calm voice 
that seemed to say: 

"Greetings. Do not be alarmed. 
We do not wish you to be 
alarmed. Our denire is only to 
serve . . ." 

GREETINGS, it s«id! Greetings!" Ball was mumbling 
incredulously through shocked 
lips. 

Everyone on the ship had heard 
the voice. When it ^poke again, 
Steffens was not sure whether it 
was just one voice or many voices. 

"We await your coming," it 
s«id gravely, and repeated: "Our 
desire is only to serve."

And then the robots sent a 
picture. 

As perfect and as clear as a 
tridim movie, a rectangular plate 
took shape in Steffen's mind. On 
the face of the plate, standing 
alone against a background of 
red-brown, bare rocks, was one 
of the robots. With slow, perfect 
movement, the robot carefully 
lifted one of the hanging arms of 
its side, of its right Side, and extended it toward Steffens. a graciously offered hand. 

Steffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, 
realized right away that the urge 
to take the hand was not entirely 
his. The robot mind had helped. 

When the picture vanished, he 
knew that the others had seen 
it He waited for a while; there 
was no further contact, but the 
feeling of the robot's urging was 
still strong within him. He had 
an idea that, if they wanted to, 
the robots could control his mind. 
So when nothing more happened, 
he began to lose his fear. 

While the crew watched in 
fascination, Steffens tried to talk 
back. He concentrated hard on 
what he was saying, said it aloud 
for good measure, then held his 
own hand extended in the robot 
manner of shaking hands. 

"Greetings," he s9W, because it 
was what they had said, and explained: "We have come from the 
stars." 



It was overly dramatic, but so 
was the whole situation. He wondered baffledly if he should have 
let the Alien Contact crew handle 
it. Order someone to stand there, 
feeling like a fool, and think a 
message? 

No. it was his responsibility; 
he had to go on: 

"We request — we respectfully 
request permission to land upon 
your planet." 

OTEFFENS had not realized 
*^ that there were so many. 

They had been gathering since 
his ship was first seen, and now 
there were hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were 
arriving even as the skiff landed; 
they glided in over the rocky hills 
with fantastic ease and power, so 
that Steffens felt a momentary 
anxiety. Most of the robots were 
standing with the silent immobility of metal. Others threaded 
their way to the fore and came 
near the skiff, but none touched 
it, and a circle was cleared for 
Steffens when he came out. 

One of the near robots came 
forward alone, moving, as Steffens now saw, on a number of 
short, incredibly strong and agile 
legs. The black thing paused before him, extended a hand as it 
had done in the picture. Steffens 
took it, he hoped, warmly; felt 
the power of the metal through 
the glove of his suit. 



 



"Welcome," the robot said, 
speaking again to his mind, and 
now Steffens detected a peculiar 
alteration in the robot's tone. It 
was less friendly now, less — Steffens could not understand — somehow less interested, as if the robot 
had been — expecting someone 
else. 

" Th ank you , ' ' Steff ens sa id. 
"We are deeply grateful for your 
permission to land." 

"Our desire," the robot repeated mechanically, "is only to 
serve." 

Suddenly, Steffens began to 
feel alone, surrounded by machines. He tried to push the 
thought out of his mind, because 
he knew that they should seem 
inhuman. But . . . 

"Will the others come down?" 
asked the robot, still mechanically. 

Steffens felt his embarrassment. 
The ship lay high in the mist 
above, jets throbbing gently. 

"They must remain with the 
ship," Steffens said aloud, trusting to the robot's formality not 
to ask him why. Although, if they 
could read his mind, there was no 
need to ask. 

For a long while, neither spoke, 
long enough for Steffens to grow 
tense and uncomfortable. He 
could not think of a thing to say, 
the robot was obviously waiting, 
and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men to come 



on out of the skiff. 

They came, wonderingly, and 
the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard the one robot speak 
again. The voice was now much 
more friendly. 

"We hope you will forgive us 
for intruding upon your thought. 
It is our— custom — not to communicate unless we are called 
upon. But when we observed 
that you were in ignorance of 
our real — nature — and were about 
to leave our planet, we decided 
to put aside our custom, so that 
you might base your decision 
upon sufficient data." 

Steffens replied haltingly that 
he appreciated their action. 

"We perceive," the robot went 
on, "that you are unaware of 
our complete access to your mind, 
and would perhaps be — dismayed 
— to learn that we have been 
gathering information from you. 
We must — apologize. Our only 
purpose was so that we could 
communicate with you, Only that 
information was taken which is 
necessary for communication and 
— understanding. We will enter 
your minds henceforth only at 
your request." 

Steffens did not react to the 
news that his mind w-as being 
probed as violently as he might 
have. Nevertheless it ww. a shock, 
and he retreated into observant 
silence as the Aliencon men went 
to work.

The robot which seemed to 
have been doing the spca ki rig 
was in no way different from any 
of the others in the group. Since 
each of the robots was immediately aware of all that was being 
said or thought, Steffens guessed 
that they had sent one forward 
just for appearance's sake, because they perceived that the 
Earthmen would feel more at 
home. The picture of the extended hand, the characteristic 
handshake of Earthmen, had 
probably been borrowed, too, for 
the same purpose of making him 
and the others feel at ease. The 
one jarring note was the robot's 
momentary lapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the 
things had seemed almost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to 
examine the first robot in detail. 

It was not very tall, being at 
least a foot shorter than the 
Earthmen. The most peculiar 
thing about it, except for the 
circling eye -band of the head , 
was a mass of symbols which 
were apparently engraved upon 
the metal chest. Symbols in row 
upon row — numbers, perhaps — 
were upon the chest, and repeated 
again below the level of the arms, 
and continued in orderly rows 
across the front of the robot, all 
the way down to the base of the 
trunk. If they were numbers, 
Steffens thought, then it was a 



remarkably complicated system. 
But he noticed the same pattern 
on the nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to 
conclude that the symbols were 
merely decoration and let it go 
tentatively at that, although the 
answer seemed illogical. 

It wasn't until he was on his 
way home that Steffens remembered the symbols again. And 
only then did he realized what 
they were. 

A FTER a while, convinced that 
there was no danger, Steffens 
had the ship brought down. When 
the crew came out of the airlock, 
they were met by the robots, and 
each man found himself with a 
robot at his side, humbly requesting to be of service. There 
were literally thousands of the ' 
robots now, come from all over 
the barren horizon. The mass of 
them stood apart, immobile on 
a plain near the ship, glinting in 
the sun like a vast, metallic field 
of black wheat. 

The robots had obviously been 
built to serve. Steffens began to 
feel their pleasure, to sense it in 
spite of the blank, expressionless 
faces. They were almost like 
"children in their eagerness, yet 
they were still reserved. Whoever had boilt them, Steffens 
thought in wonder, had built 
them well. 

Ball came to join Steffens, star

ing at the robots through the 
clear plastic of his helmet with 
taffledly widened eyes. A robot 
moved out from the mass in the 
field, allied itself to him. The 
first to speak had remained with 
Steffens. 

Realizing that the robot could 
hear every word he was saying. 
Ball was for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of 
standing and talking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead 
metal upon the bare rock of a 
dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died. It was impossible not to like the things. 
There was something in their 
very lines which was pleasant and 
relaxing. 

Their builders. Steffens thought, 
had probably thought of that, 
too. 

"There's no harm in them, 1 * 
raid Ball at last, openly, not 
minding if the robots heard. 
"They seem actually glad we're 
here. My God, whoever heard of 
a robot being glad?" 

Steffens, embarrassed, spoke 
quickly to the nearest mechanical : "I hope you will forgive us 
cur curiosity, but — yours is a remarkable race. We have never 
before made contact with a race 
like yours." It was said haltingly, 
but it was the best he could do. 

The robot made a singularly 
human nodding motion of its 
head. 



"I perceive that the nature of 

our construction is unfamiliar to 
you. Your question is whether or 
not we are entirely 'mechanical.' 
I am not exactly certain as to 
what the word 'mechanical' is 
intended to convey — I would 
have to examine your thought 
more fully — but I believe that 
there is fundamental similarity 
between our structures." 

The robot paused. Steffens had 
a distinct impression that it was 
disconcerted. 

"I must tell you," the thing 
went on, "that we ourselves arecurious." It stopped suddenly, 
struggling with a word it could 
not comprehend. Steffens waited, 
listening with absolute interest. 
It said at length: 

"We know of only two types 
of living structure. Ours, which 
is largely metallic, and that of the 
Makers, which would appear to 
be somewhat more like yours. I 
am not a— doctor — and therefore 
cannot acquaint you with the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you arc interested 
I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to be of 
assistance." 

It was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while Ball and the second 
robot looked on in silence. The 
Makers, obviously, were whoever 
or whatever h#d built the robots, 
and the "doctors," Steffens de



 



cided, were probably just that 
— doctor- robots, designed specifically to care for the apparently 
flesh-bodies of the Makers. 

The efficiency of the things 
continued to amaze him, but the 
question he had been waiting to 
ask came out now with a rush: 

"Can you tell us where the 
Makers are?" 

Both robots stood motionless. 
It occurred to Steffens that he 
couldn't really be sure which was 
speaking. The voice that came to 
him spoke with difficulty. 

"The Makers — are not here." 

Steffens stared in puzzlement. 
The robot detected his confusion 
and went on: 

"The Makers have gone away. 
They have been gone for a very 
long time." 

Could that be pain in its voice, 
Steffens wondered, and then the 
spectre of the ruined cities rose 
harsh in his mind. 

War. The Makers had all been 
killed in that war. And these had 
not been killed. 

He tried to grasp it, but he 
couldn't. There were robots here 
in the midst of a radiation so 
lethal that nothing, nothing could 
live; robots on a dead planet, 
living in an atmosphere of carbon 
dioxide. 

The carbon dioxide brought 
him up sharp. 

If there had been life here once, 
there would have been plant life 



as well, and therefore oxygen. If 
the war had been so long ago 
that the free oxygen had since 
gone out of the atmosphere — 
good God, how old were the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then 
at the silent robots, then out 
across the field to where the rest 
of them stood. The black wheat. 
Steffens felt a deep chill. 
Were they immortal? 

•'"TC70ULD you like to see a 
^» doctor?" 

Steffens jumped at the familiar 
words, then realized to what the 
robot was referring. 

"No, not yet," he said, "thank 
you." He swallowed hard as the 
robots continued waiting patient
ly. 

"Could you tell me," he said 
at last, "how old you are? Individually?" 

"By your reckoning," said his 
robot, and paused to make the 
calculation, "I am forty- four 
years, seven months, and eighteen 
days of age, with ten years and 
approximately nine months yet 
to be alive." 

Steffens tried to understand 
that. 

"It would perhaps simplify our 
conversations," said the robot, 
"if you were to refer to me by a 
name, as is your custom. Using 
the first — letters — of my designation, my name would translate as 
Elb."

"Glad to meet you," Steffens 
mumbled. 

"You are called 'Stef ,' " said 
the robot obligingly. Then it 
added, pointing an arm at the 
robot near Ball : "The age of — 
Peb — is seventeen years, one 
month and four days. Peb has 
therefore remaining some thirtyeight years." 



SteFfens was trying to keep up. 
Then the life span was obviously 
about fifty-five years. But the 
cities, and the carbon dioxide? 
The robot, Elb, had said that the 
Makers were similar to him, and 
therefore oxygen and plant life 
would have been needed. Unless — 

He remembered the buildings 
on Tyban IV. 





 



Unless the Makers had not 
come from this planet at all. 

His mind helplessly began to 
revolve. It was Ball who restored 
order. 

"Do you build yourselves?" the 
exec asked. 

Peb answered quickly, that 
faint note of happiness again apparent, as if the robot was glad 



for the opportunity of answering. 

"No, we do not build ourselves. 
We are made by the- — " another 
pause for a word — "by the Factory" 

"The Factory?" 

"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?" 

Both of the Earthmen nodded 
dumbly. 




ORPHANS OF TH VOID 



91 



"Would you prefer to use your 
— skiff? It is quite a long way 
from here." 

It was indeed a long way, even 
by skiff. Some of the Alicncon 
crew went along with them. And 
near the edge of the twilight zone, 
on the other side of the world, 
they saw the Factory outlined 
in the dim light of dusk. A huge, 
fantastic block, wrought of gray 
and cloudy metal, lay in a valley 
between two worn mountains. 
Steffens went down low, circling 
in the skiff, stared in awe at the 
size of the building. Robots 
moved outside the thing, little 
black bugs in the distance — moving around their birthplace. 

rriHE Earthmen remained for 
■ several weeks. During that 
time, Steffens was usually with 
Elb, talking now as often as he 
listened, and the Aliencon team 
roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the 
strangest culture in history. There 
was stilt the mystery of those 
buildings on Tyban IV; that, as 
well as the robots' origin, would 
have to be cleared up before they 
could leave. 

Surprisingly, Steffens did not 
think about the future. Whenever he came near a robot, he 
sensed such a general, comfortable air of good feeling that it 
warmed him, and he was so preoccupied with watching the ro


bots that he did little thinking. 

Something he had not realized 
at the beginning was that he was 
as unusual to the robots as they 
were to him. It came to him with 
a great shock that not one of the 
robots had ever seen a living 
thing. Not a bug, a worm, a leaf. 
They did not know what flesh 
was. Only the doctors knew that, 
and none of them could readily 
understand what was meant by 
the words "organic matter." It 
had taken them some time to 
recognize that the Earthmen wore 
suits which were not parts of their 
bodies, and it was even more difficult for them to understand why 
the suits were needed. 

But when they did under;! ind, 
the robots did a surprising thing. 

At first, because of the excessive radiation, none of the Earthmen could remain outside the 
ship for long, even in radiation 
suits. And one morning, when 
Steffens came out of- the ship, it 
was to discover that hundreds of 
the robots, working through the 
night, had effectively decontaminated the entire area. 

It was at this point that Steffens asked how many robots there 
were. He learned to his amazement that there were more th Ul 
nine million. The great mass of 
them had politely remained a 
great distance from the ship, 
spread out over the planet, since 
they were highly radioactive. 




 



Steffens, meanwhile, courteously allowed Elb to probe into his 
~ mind. The robot extracted all the 
knowledge of matter that Steffens held, pondered over the* 
knowledge and tried to digest it, 
and passed it on to the other 
robote. Steffens, in turn, had a 
difficult time picturing the mind 
of a thing that had never known 
life. 

He had a vague idea of the 
robot's history — more, perhaps, 
then they knew themselves — but 
he refrained from forming an 
opinion until Aliencon made its 
report. What fascinated him was 
Elb's amazing philosophy, the 
only outlook, really, that the 
robot could have had. 

"\S7 HAT do you do? Steffens 

»* asked. 

Elb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: "We can do 
very little. A certain amount of 
physical knowledge was imparted to us at birth by the Makers. We spend the main part of 
our time expanding that knowledge wherever possible. We have 
made some progress in the natural sciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you 
see, is to serve the Makers. Any 
ability we can acquire will make 
us that much more fit to serve 
when the Makers return." 

"When they return?" It had 
not occurred to Steffens until 



now that the robots expected the 
Makers to do so. 

Elb regarded him out of the 
band of the circling eye. "I see 
you had surmised that the Makers were not coming back." 

If the robot could have laughed, 
Steffens 4 thought it would have, 
then. But it just stood there, 
motionless, its tone politely emphatic. 

"It has always been our belief 
that the Makers would return. 
Why else would we have been 
built?" 

Steffens thought the robot 
would go on, but it didn't. The 
question, to Elb, was no question at all. 

Although Steffens knew already 
what the robot could not possibly 
have known — that the Makers 
were gone and would never come 
back — he was a long time understanding. What he did was push 
this speculation into the back of 
his mind, to keep it from Elb. 
He had no desire to destroy a 
faith. 

But it created a problem in 
him. He had begun to picture 
for Elb the structure of human 
society, and the robot — a machine 
which did not eat or sleep — listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens mentioned God. 

"God?" the robot repeated, 
without comprehension. "What 
is God?"

Steffens explained briefly, and 
the robot answered: 

"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that 
you were the Makers returning — " 
Steffens remembered the brief 
lapse , the seeming di sappoi nt ment he had sensed — "hut then 
we probed your minds and found, 
that you were not, that you were 
another kind of being, unlike 
either the Makers or ourselves. 
You were not even — " Elb caught 
himself — "you did not happen to 
be telepaths. Therefore we troubled over who made you. We did 
detect the word 'Maker' in your 
theology, but it seemed to have a 
peculiar — " Elb paused for a long 
while — "an untouchable, intangible meaning which varies among 
you." 

Steffens understood. He nodded. 

The Makers were the robots' 
God. were all the God they 
needed. The Makers had built 
them, the planet, the universe. If 
he were to ask them who made 
the Makers, it would be like their 
asking him who made God. 

It was an ironic parallel, and 
he smiled to himself. 

But on that planet, it was the 
last time he smiled. 

THE report from Aliencon was 
finished at the end of the fifth 
week. Lieutenant Ball brought it 
in to Steffens in his cabin, laid 



it on the desk before him. 

"Get set," Ball advised stiffly, 
indicating the paper. There was 
a strained, brittle expression on 
his face. "I sort of figured it, but 
I didn't know it was this bad." 

When Steffens looked up in 
surprise, Ball said: 

"You don't know. Read it. Go 
ahead." The exec turned tautly 
and left the room. 

Steffens stared after him, then 
looked down at the paper. The 
hint he had of the robots' history 
came back into his mind. Nervously, he picked up the report 
and started to read. 

The story unfolded objectively. 
It was clear and cold, the way 
formal reports must always be. 
Yet there was a great deal of emotion in it. Even Aliencon couldn't 
help that. 

• What it told was this: 

The Makers had been almost 
humanoid. Almost, but with certain notable exceptions. They 
were telepaths — no doubt an im* 
portant factor in their remarkable 
technological progress — and were 
equipped with a secondary pair 
of arms. The robot-doctors were 
able to give flawless accounts of 
their body chemistry, which was 
similar to Earth -type, and the 
rubble of the cities had given a 
certain amount of information 
concerning their society and habits. An attached paper described 
the sociology, but Steffens put it

aside until sometime later. 

There had been other Factories. 
The remains of them had been 
found in several places, on each 
of the other continents. They had 
been built sometime prior to the 
war, and all but one of the Factories had subsequently been destroyed. 

Yet the Makers were not, as 
Steffens had supposed, a warlike 
people. Telepathy had given them 
the power to know each others* 
minds and to interchange ideas, 
and their record of peace was 
favorable, especially when compared with Earth's. Nevertheless, 
a war had begun, for some reason 
Aliencon could not find, and it 
had obviously gotten out of hand. 

Radiation and bacteria eventually destroyed the Makers; the 
last abortive efforts created 
enough radiation to destroy life 
entirely. There were the germs 
and the bombs and the burning 
rays, and in the end everything 
was blasted and died — everything, that is, but the one lone 
Factory. By a pure, blind freak, 
it survived. 

And, naturally, it kept turning 
out robots. 

It was powered by an atomic 
pile, stocked with materials 
which, when combined with the 
returning, worn-out robots, enabled it to keep producing indefinitely. The process, even of 
repair, was entirely automatic. 



Year after year, the robots 
came out in a slow, steady stream. 
Un governed, un instructed, they 
gathered around the Factory and 
waited, communicated only rarely among themselves. Gradually 
the memory of war, of life — of 
everything but that which was 
imprisoned in their minds at 
birth — was lost. 

The robots kept coming, and 
they stood outside the Factory. 

The robot brain, by far the* 
finest thing the Makers had ever 
built, was variable. There was 
never a genius brain, and never a 
moron brain, yet the intelligence 
of the robots varied considerably 
in between. Slowly, over the long 
years, th,e more intelligent among 
them began to communicate with 
each other, to inquire, and then 
to move away from the Factory, 
searching. 

They looked for someone to 
serve and, of course, there was 
no one. The Makers were gone, 
but the crime was not in that 
alone. For when the robots were 
built, the Makers had done this: 

Along with the first successful 
robot brain, the Makers had 
realized the necessity of creating 
a machine which could never turn 
against them. The present robot 
brain was the result. As Steffens 
had already sensed, the robots 
could feel pain. Not the pain of 
physical injury, for there were no 
nerves in the metal bodies, but 



ORPHANS OF TKE V 01 D 



the pain of frustration, the pressure of thwarted emotion, mental 
pain. 

And so, into the robot brain, 
the Makers had placed this prime 
Directive: the robots could only 
feel content, free from the pain, 
as long as they were serving the 
Makers. The robots must act for 
the Makers, must be continually 
engaged in carrying out the 
wishes of the Makers, or else 
there was a slowly growing irritation, a restlessness and discontent which mounted as the unserving days went by. 

And there were no more Makers to serve. 

t'w *HE pain was not unbearable. 

The Makers themselves were 
not fully aware of the potentialities 
of the robot brain, and therefore 
did not risk deranging it. So the 
pressure reached a peak and leveled off, and for all of the days of 
the robots' lives, they felt it 
never-ending, awake and aware, 
each of them, for fifty-five years. 

And the robots never stopped 
coming. 

A millenium passed, during 
which the robots began to move 
and to think for themselves. Yet 
it was much longer before they 
found a way in which to serve. 

The atomic pile which powered 
the Factory, having gone on for 
almost five thousand years, eventually wore out. The power 



ceased. The Factory stopped. 

It was the first event in the 
robots' history. Never before had 
there been a time when they had 
known anything at all to alter 
the course of their lives, except 
the varying weather and the unvarying pain. There was one 
among them now that began to 
reason. 

It saw that no more robots were 
being produced, and although it 
could not be sure whether or not 
this was as the Makers had ordained, it formed an idea. If the 
purpose of the robots was to 
serve, then they would fail in 
that purpose if they were to die 
out. The robot thought this and 
communicated it to the others, 
and then, together, they began to 
rebuild the pile. 

It was not difficult. The necessary knowledge was already in 
their minds, implanted at birth. 
The significance lay in the fact 
that, for the first time in their 
existence, the robots had acted 
upon their own initiative, had begun to serve again. Thus the pain 
ceased. 

When the pile was finished, the 
robots felt the return of the pain 
and, having once begun, they 
continued to attempt to serve. A 
great many examined the Factory, found that they were able to 
improve upon the structure of 
their bodies, so that they might 
be better able to serve the Ma


GALAXY SClENCt FICTION 



kers when they returned. Accordingly, they worked in the Factory, 
perfecting themselves — although 
they could not improve the brains 
— and many others left the Factory and began to examine mathematics and the physical universe. 

It was not hard for them to 
build a primitive spaceship, for 
the Makers had been on the verge 
of interstellar flight, and they 
flew it hopefully throughout the 
solar system, looking to see if the 
Makers were there. Finding no 
one, they left the buildings on 
Tyban IV as a wistful monument, with a hope that the Makers would some day pass this 
way and be able to use them. 

Millenia passed. The pile broke 
down again, was rebuilt, and so 
the cycle was repeated. By infinitesimal steps, the robots 
learned and recorded their learning in the minds of new robots. 
Eventually they reached the limits of their capability. 

The pain returned and never 
left. 

STEFFENS left his desk, went 
over and leaned against the 
screen. For a long while he stood 
gazing through the mists of carbon air at the pitiful, loyal mechanicals who thronged outside 
the ship. He felt an almost overwhelming desire to break something, anything, but all he could 
do was swear to himself. 

tr 



Ball came back, looked at Steffens' eyes and into them. His own 
were sick. 

"Twenty-five thousand years," 
he said thickly, "that's how long 
it was. Twenty - five thousand 
years . . ." 

Steffens was pale and wordless. 
The mass of the robots outside 
stood immobile, ageless among 
rock which was the same, hurting, hurting. A fragment of an 
old poem came across Steffens' 
mind. "They also serve who only 
stand and wait ..." 

Not since he was very young 
had he been so deeply moved. He 
stood up rigidly and began to 
talk to himself, saying in his 
mind : 

It is all over now. To hell with 
what is past. We will take them 
away from this place and let them 
serve and, by God . „ . 

He faltered. But the knowledge 
of what could be done strengthened him. Earthmen would have 
to come in ships to take the robots away. It would be a little 
while, but after all those years a 
little while was nothing, less than 
nothing. He stood there thinking 
of the things the robots could do, 
of how. in the Mapping Command alone, they would be invaluable. Temperature and atmosphere meant nothing to them. 
They could land on almost any 
world, could mine and build and 
develop . . . 



And so it would be ended. The 
robots would serve Man. 

Steffens took one long, painful 
breath. Then he strode from the 
room without speaking to Ball, 
went forward to the lockers and 
pulled out a suit, and a moment 
later he w^is in the airlock. 

He had one more thing to do, 
and it would be at once the gladdest and most difficult job that 
he had ever attempted. He had 
to tell the robots. 

He had to go out into the sand 
and face them, tell them that all 
of the centuries of pain had been 
for nothing, that the Makers 
were dead and would never return, that every robot built for 
twenty-five thousand years had 
been just surplus, purposeless. 
And yet — and this was how he 
was able to do it — he was also 
coming to tell them that the 
wasted years were over, that the 
years of doing had begun. 

As he stepped from the airlock 
he saw Elb standing, immobile, 
waiting by the ship. In the last 
few seconds Steffens realized that 
it was not necessary to put this 
into words. 

When he reached the robot, he 
put forth a hand and touched 
Elb's arm, and said very softly: 

"Elb, my friend, you must look 
into my mind — " 

And the robot, as always, 
obeyed.
