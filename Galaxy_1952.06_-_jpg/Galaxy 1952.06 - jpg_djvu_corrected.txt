GRAVITY PLANET 



AS I dressed that morning, 
I ran over in my mind 
/ m the long list of statistics, 
evasions and exaggerations that 
they would expect in my report. 
My section — Production — had 
been plagued with a long series 
of illnesses and resignations, and 
you can't get work done without 
people to do it. But the Board 
wasn't likely to take that as an 
excuse. 

I rubbed the depilatory soap 
.over my face and rinsed it with 
the trickle from the fresh-water 
tap. Wasteful, of course, but I 
could afford the cost, and salt 
water always leaves my face 
itchy. Before the last of the stubble was washed away, the trickle 
stopped and didn't start again. I 
swore a little and finished rinsing 
with salt. It had been happening 
lately; some people blamed Connie saboteurs. Loyalty raids were 
being held throughout the New 
York Water Supply Corporation, 
but so far they hadn't changed 
the damned water situation. Very 
annoying, considering the price 
of fresh water — you'd think the 
company would protect its customers. 

The morning newscast over the 
shaving mirror caught me for a 
moment . . . the President's lastnight speech, a brief glimpse of 
the Venus rocket, squat and silvery on the Arizona sand, rioting 
in Panama ... I switched it off 

I 



when the quarter-hour time signal chimed over the audio band. 

It looked as though I was going 
to be late again, which certainly 
would not help mollify the Board. 

I saved five minutes by wearing yesterday's shirt and by leaving my breakfast juice to grow 
warm and sticky on the table. 
But I lost the five minutes by 
trying to call Kathy. She didn't 
answer the phone. "And I was 
late getting into the office. 

FORTUNATELY — and unprecedented! y — Fowler 
Schocken was late too. 

In our office it was Fowler's 
custom to hold Board conferences 
fifteen minutes before the regular 
opening of the business day. It 
kept the clerks and stenos on 
their toes, and it was no hardship 
to Fowler. He spent every morning in the office anyway: "morning" to him began with the rising 
of the Sun. 

Today, though, I had time to 
get my secretary's summary off 
my desk before the meeting. 
When Fowler Schocken walked 
in with a courteous apology for 
his tardiness, I was sitting in my 
place at the foot of the table, 
reasonably relaxed and as sure 
of myself as a Fowler Schocken 
Associate was ever likely to be. 

"Good morai«g," Fowler said 
and the eleven of us made the 
proper murmur. He didn't sit 



down; he stood gazing fondly as 
a father at us for about a minute 
and a half. Then he looked carefully and delightedly about the 
room. 

"I've been thinking about our 
conference room," he said, and 
we all looked around at it. The 
room wasn't big, it wasn't small: 
say ten by twelve. But it was cool, 
well-lighted and most imposingly 
furnished. The air recirculators 
were cleverly hidden behind animated friezes; the carpeting was 
thick and soft; and every piece 
of furniture was constructed from 
top to bottom of authentic, expertized, genuine tree-grown 
wood. 

Fowler Schocken said : "We 
have a nice conference room here, 
men, as we should have — Fowler 
Schocken Associates is the largest 
advertising agency in the city. 
We bill a megabuck a year more 
than anybody else around. And 
— " he looked around at all of 
us — "I think you'll agree that 
we all find it worth while. I don't 
believe there's a person in this 
room who has less than a tworoom apartment." He twinkled at 
me. "Even the bachelors. Speaking for myself, I've done well. 
My summer place looks right 
over one of the largest paries on 
Long Island. I haven't tasted any 
protein but new rrfleat for years 
and when I go out for a spin I 
pedal a Cadillac. The wolf is a

long way from my door. And I 
think any one of you can say the 
same. Right?" The hand of our 
Director of Market Research shot 
up and Fowler nodded at him: 
"Yes, Matthew?" 

Matt Runstead knew which 
side his bread was oiled on. He 
glared belligerently around the 
table. "I just want to go on record as agreeing with Mr. 
Schocken one hundred per cent 
— all the way!" 

"Thank you, Matthew." It took 
Fowler Schocken a moment before he could go on. "Well, we 
all know what put us where wc 
are. We remember the Starrzelius 
Verily account, and how we put 
Indiastries on the map. The first 
spherical trust. Merging a whole 
subcontinent into a single manufacturing complex. Schocken Associates pioneered on both of 
them. Nobody can say we were 
floating with the tide. But that's 
behind us. 

"Men, I want to know something. You can tell me truthfully 
— are we getting soft?" He took 
time to look at ench of our faces 
searchingly, ignoring the forest 
of hands in the air. Mine was 
right up there, too. Then he 
waved to the man at his right. 
"You first, Ben." 

Ben Winston stood up and 
baritoned: "Speaking for Industrial Anthropology, no! Listen to 
today's progress report — you'll 



get it in the noon bulletin, but 
let me brief you now. According 
to the midnight indices, all primary schools east of the Mississippi are now using our 
packaging recommendation for 
the school lunch program. Soyaburgers and generated steak are 
shrewdly packed in containers 
the same shade of green as the 
Universal products, to transfer 
unconsciously the distaste to our 
competition. But the candy, ice 
cream and kiddiebutt cigarette 
ration are wrapped in colorful 
Starrzelius red. When those little 
consumers grow up . . ." He lifted 
his eyes exultantly from his notes. 
"According to our extrapolation, 
fifteen years from now Universal 
products will be bankrupt and off 
the market entirely!" 

He sat down in a wave of applause. Schocken clapped, too, 
and looked brightly at the rest of 
us. I leaned forward with Expression One — eagerness, intelligence, competence — all over my 
face. But I needn't have bothered. 
Fowler pointed to the lean man 
next to Winston. Harvey Bruner. 

"I don't have to tell you men 
that Point-of-Sale has its special 
problems," Harvey said, puffing 
his thin cheeks. "1 swear, the 
whole damned government must 
be infiltrated with Connies!" He 
was beginning to get hysterical. 
"You know what they've done. 
They outlawed compulsive sub

sonics in our auditory captiveaudience advertising — but we've 
bounced back with a list of semantic cue words that tie in with 
every basic trauma and neurosis 
in American life today. They 
listened to the safety cranks and 
stopped us from projecting our 
messages on aircar windows, but 
Lab tells me—" he nodded to our 
Director of Research across the 
table— "that soon we'll be testing 
a system that projects direct on 
the retina of the eye. 

"But we're not content with 
that. We're going forward. As an 
example I want to mention the 
Coffiest pro — " He broke off. "Excuse me, Mr. Schocken," he 
whispered. "Has Security checked 
this room?'* ** 

Fowler Schocken nodded. "Absolutely clean. Nothing but the 
usual State Department and 
House of Representatives spymikes. And of course we're feeding a canned playback into 
them." 

Harvey relaxed again. "Well, 
about this Coffiest." he said. 
"We're sampling it in fifteen key 
cities. It's the usual offer — a thirteen-week supply of Coffiest, ten 
thousand dollars in cash and a 
weekend vacation on the Ligurian 
Riviera to everybody who comes 
in. But — and here's what makes 
this campaign truly great, in my 
estimation — each sample of Coffiest contains three milligrams of a 



simple alkaloid. Nothing harmful, but definitely habit-forming. 
After ten weeks the customer is 
hooked for life. It would cost him 
at least fifty thousand dollars for 
a cure, so it's simpler for him to 
go right on drinking Cofliest — 
three cups with every meal and 
a pot beside his bed at night, just 
as it says on the jar." 

Fowler Schocken beamed and 
I braced myself into Expression 
One again. Next to Harvey sat 
Tildy Mathis, Chief of Personnel 
and hand-picked by Schocken 
himself. He didn't ask women to 
speak at Board sessions, and next 
to Tildy sat me. But Fowler 
let me down with a smile. 

He said : "I won't ask every 
section to report. We haven't the 
time. But you've given me your 
answer, gentlemen, It's the answer I like. You've met every 
challenge up to now. I wnnt to 
give you a new challenge." 

He pressed a button on his 
monitor panel and swiveled his 
chair around. The lights went 
down in the room ; the projected 
art calendar (executives only) 
that hung behind Schocken's 
chair faded and revealed the mottled surface of the screen. On it 
another picture began to form. 

T HAD seen that picture once 
■P- before, that same day, in the 
news screen over my shaving 
mirror. 




 



It was the Venus rocket, 
a thousand-foot monster, the 
bloated child of the slim V-2s 
and stubby Moon rockets of the 
past. Around it was a scaffolding 
of steel and aluminum, a-crawl 
with tiny figures that manipulated minute, blue-white welding 
flames. The picture was obviously 
recorded ; it showed the rocket 
as it had been weeks or months 
ago in an earlier stage of construction, not poised as if ready 
for takeoff, the way I had seen 
it earlier. 

A voice from the screen said 
triumphantly and inaccurately: 
"This is the ship that spans the 
stars!'* I recognized the voice as 
belonging to one of the organtoned commentators in Aural Effects and expertized the script 
without effort as emanating from 
one of Tildy's girl copywriters. 
The talented slovenliness that 
would confuse Venus with a star 
had to come from somebody on 
her staff. 

"This is the ship that a modern Columbus will drive through 
the void," said the voice. "Six 
and a half million tons of trapped 
lightning and steel — an ark for 
eighteen hundred men and 
women, and everything to make 
a new world for their home. Who 
will be in it? What fortunate pioneers will tear an empire from 
the rich, fresh soil of another 
world? 



"Let me introduce you to them 
—a man and his wife, two of the 
intrepid . . 

The voice kept going. On the 
screen, the picture dissolved to a 
spacious suburban roomette in 
early morning — the husband 
folding the bed into the wall and 
taking down the partition to the 
children's nook; the wife dialing 
breakfast and erecting the tr.ble. 
Over the breakfast juices and the 
children's pablum (with a steaming mug of Coftiest for each, of 
course) they spoke persuasively 
to each other about how wise and 
brave they had been to apply for 
passage in the Venus rocket. And 
the closing question of their 
youngest babbler ("Mommy, 
when I grow up kin I take my 
boys and girls to a place as nice 
as Venus?") cued the switch to 
a highly imaginative serits of 
shots of Venus as it would be 
when the child grew up — verdant 
valleys, crystal lakes, brilliant 
mountain vistas. 

THE commentary did not 
deny, and neither did it 
dwell on, the decades of hydroponics and life in hermetically 
sealed cabins that the pioneers 
would have to endure while working on Venus's unbreathable 
atmosphere and waterless chemistry. 

Instinctively I had set the 
timer button on my watch as the 



GRAVY PLANIT 



f 



picture started. When it was over, 
I read the dial: nine minutes, 
three times as long as any commercial could legally run! 

1 1 was only after the lights 
were on again, the cigarettes lit 
and Fowler Schocken well into 
his pep talk for the day that I 
saw the answer. He called our 
attention to the history of advertising — from the simple handmaiden task of selling already 
manufactured goods to its present role of creating industries and 
redesigning a world's folkways to 
meet the needs of. commerce. He 
touched once more on what we 
ourselves, Fowler Schocken Associates, had done with our own 
expansive career. And then he 
said: 

"There's an old saying, men, 
'The world is our oyster.' We've 
made it come true. But we've 
eaten that oyster. We've actually 
and literally conquered the world. 
Like Napoleon, we weep for new 
worlds to conquer. And there — " 
he waved at the screen behind 
him — "you have just seen the 
first of those worlds." 

I have never liked Matt Runstead, as you may have gathered. 
He is a Paul Pry whom I suspect 
of wiretapping even within the 
company. He must have spied 
out the Venus project well in advance, because not even the most 
talented reflexes could have 
brought out his little speech. 



While the rest of us were still 
busy assimilating what Fowler 
Schocken had told us, Runstead 
was leaping to his feet. 

"Gentlemen," he said with passion, "this is truly the work of 
genius. Not just India, not just 
a commodity, but a whole planet 
to sell ! I salute you, Fowler 
Schocken — the Clive, the Bolivar, 
the John Jacob Astor of a new 
world!" 

Matt was first, as I say, but 
every one of us got up and said 
in turn about the same thing. Including me. Kathy had never understood it and I'd tried to 
explain that it was a religious 
ritual — like the champagne bottle at a ship's launching, or the 
sacrifice of the virgin to the corn 
crop. I don't think any of us, 
except maybe Matt Runstead, 
would feed habit-forming narcotics to the world for money 
alone. There was a high ideal behind it — production for use and 
profit. With our enormously advanced technology, we could produce more coffee, to mention just 
one item out of the innumerable 
roster of foods and goods and 
services, than the world could 
normally consume. Our sacred 
task was to keep the demand 
right in step with the supply — 
not an easy one if you consider 
the flood of things produced on 
farms and in factories. 

But we did it! By Morgan, we 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



did it and we were proud to be 
able to! 

WHEN all of us had done, 
Fowler Schocken touched 
another button and showed us a 
chart. 

He explained it carefully item 
by item. He showed us tables and 
graphs and diagrams of the entire new Department of Fowler 
Schocken Associates which would 
be set up to handle the development and exploitation of the 
pi a net Venus. He cove red the 
tedious lobbying and friendmaking in Congress which had 
given us the exclusive right to build up and profit from the 
planet, and I began to see how 
he could safely use a nine-minute 
commercial. He explained how 
the Government naturally wanted 
Venus to be an American planet 
and how they had invoked our 
American supremacy in advertising to make it possible. 

As he spoke, we all caught 
some of his fire. I envied the man 
who would head the Venus Section; any one of us would have 
committed even a commercial offense to get the job. 

He spoke of trouble lining up 
the Senator from DuPont Chemicals with his 45 votes, and of an 
easy triumph over the Senator 
from Nash-Kelvinator with his 
six. He spoke proudly of a faked 
Connie demonstration against 



Fowler Schocken which had lined 
up the anti-Connie Secretary of 
the Interior. 

Visual Aids had done a beautiful job of briefing the information, but we were there nearly 
an hour looking at the charts and 
listening to Fowler's achievements and plans. 

But finally he clicked off the 
projector and said: "There you 
have it. That's our new campaign. And it starts right away 
— now. I have only one more announcement to make and then 
we can all get to work." 

Fowler Schocken is a good 
showman. He took the time to 
find a slip of paper and read from 
it a sentence that the lowest of 
our copyboys could deliver off 
the cuff. "The chairman of the 
Venus Section," he read, "will be 
Mitchell Courtenay." 

And that was the biggest surprise of all, because Mitchell 
Courtenay, five feet eleven inches 
tall, sandy -haired, modc-rntcly 
good-looking except for a nose 
that was pushed a little off center 
—is me. 

II 

I LINGERED with Fowler for 
three or four minutes while 
the rest of the Board went back 
to their offices, and the elevator 
ride down from the Board room 
to my own office on the cighty

XX 



sixth floor took a few seconds, 
so Hester was already clearing 
out my desk when I arrived. 

"Congratulations, Mr. Courtenay," she said. "You're moving 
to the eighty-ninth now. Isn't it 
wonderful? And I'll have a private office, too!" 

I thanked her and picked up 
the phone over the desk, staying 
out of her way. The first thing I 
had to do was get my staff in and 
turn over the reins of Production; 
Tom Gillespie was next in line. 
But the first thing I did do was 
to dial Kathy's apartment again. 
There was still no answer, so I 
called in the boys. 

They were properly sorry to 
see me go and properly delighted 
about everybody moving up a 
notch. 

And then it was lunch time, so 
I postponed the problem of the 
planet Venus until the afternoon. 

X made a phone call, ate 
quickly in the company cafeteria, 
took the elevator down to the 
shuttle and the shuttle south for 
sixteen blocks. Coming out. I 
found myself in the open air for 
the first time that day and 
reached for my anti-soot plugs, 
but didn't put them in. The light 
rain had temporarily washed the 
air clean. It was summer, hot and 
sticky ; the hordes of people 
crowding the sidewalks were as 
anxious as I to get back inside 
a building. I had to bulldoze my 



way across the street and into 
the lobby. 

The elevator took me up fourteen floors. It was an old building 
with imperfect air conditioning; 
I felt a chill in my damp suit. 
It occurred to me to use that instead of the story I had prepared, 
but I decided against it. 

A girl in a starched white uniform looked up as I walked into 
the office. I said: "My name is 
Silver. Walter P. Silver. I have 
an appointment." 

"Yes. Mr. Silver," she remembered. "Your heart. You said it 
was an emergency." 

"That's right. It's probably 
psychosomatic, but I felt — " 

"Of course." She waved me to 
a chair. "Dr. Nevin will see you 
in just a moment." 

It was ten minutes. A young 
woman came out of the doctor's 
office and a man who had been, 
waiting in the reception room before me went in; then he came 
out and the nurse said to me: 
"Will you go into Dr. Nevin's 
office now?" 

I went in. Kathy. very trim 
and handsome in her doctor's 
smock, was putting a case chart 
in her desk. When she straightened up, she said, "Oh, Mitch!" 
in a very annoyed tone. 

"I told only one lie," I said. "I 
gave the girl a phony name. But 
it is an emergency. And my heart 
is involved." 



la 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



There was a faint impulse toward a smile, but it didn't quite 
reach the surface. "Not medically," she said. 

"I told her it was probably psychosomatic. She said to come in 
anyhow." 

"I'll speak to her about that. 
Mitch, you know I can't see you 
during working hours. Now 
please — " 

I sat down next to her desk. 
"You won't see me any time, 
Kathy. What's the trouble?" 

"Nothing's the trouble. Please 
go away, Mitch. I'm a doctor; I 
have work to do." 

"Nothing as important as this. 
Kathy, I tried to call you all last 
night and all this morning." 

She struck a cigarette without 
looking at me. "I wasn't home." 

"No, you weren't. I don't suppose I have the right to ask my 
own wife where she spends her 
time, do I?" 

"Damn it, Mitch, you know — " 
Her phone rang. She screwed her 
eyes shut for a moment. Then she 
picked up the phone, leaning 
back in her chair, looking across 
the room, relaxed, a doctor soothing a patient. It took only a few 
moments. But when it was all 
over, she was entirely self-possessed. 

"Please go away," she said, 
stubbing out her cigarette. 

"Not until you tell me when 
you'll see me." 



"I . . . haven't time to see you. 
I'm not your wife. You have no 
right to bother me like this. I 
could have you enjoined or arrested." 

"My certificate's on file," I reminded her. 

"Mine isn't. It never will be. As 
soon as the year is up, we're 
through, Mitch." 

"There was something I wanted to tell you." Kathy had always been reachable through 
curiosity. 

Instead of saying again, 
"Please go away," she said. "Well, 
what is it?" 

"It's something big. It calls for 
a celebration. And I'm not above 
using it as an excuse to see you 
for just a little while tonight. 
Please. Kathy — I love you very 
much and I promise not to make 
a scene." 

"Well — " While she was thinking, her phone rang. "All right," 
she said. "Call me at home. Seven 
o'clock. Now let me take care of 
the sick people." 

She picked up the phone. I let 
myself out of her office while she 
was talking, and she didn't look 
after me. 

FOWLER SCHOCKEN was 
hunched over his desk as I 
walked in. He was staring at the 
latest issue of Taunton's Weekly. 
The magazine was blinking in 
full color as the triggered mole

cults of its inks collected photons 
by driblets and released them in 
bursts. He waved the brilliant 
pages at me and asked: "What 
do you think of this, Mitch?" 

"Sleazy advertising," I said 
promptly. "If we had to stoop 
so low as to sponsor a magazine 
like Taunton Associates, I think 
I'd resign. It's too cheap a trick." 

He put the magazine face 
down; the flashing inks gave one 
last burst and subsided as their 
light source was cut off. 

"Yes, it's cheap," he said 
thoughtfully. "But you have to 
give them credit for enterprise. 
Taunton gets sixteen and a half 
million readers for his ads every 
week. Nobody else's — just Taunton clients. And I hope you didn't 
mean that literally about resigning. I just gave Harvey the goahead on Schock. The first issue 
comes out in the fall, with a print 
order of twenty million." 

He mercifully held up his hand 
to cut off my stammering try at 
an explanation. "I understood 
what you meant, Mitch. You 
were against cheap advertising. 
So am I. Taunton is to me the 
epitome of everything that keeps 
advertising from finding its rightful place with the clergy, medicine and the bar in our way of 
life. There isn't a shoddy trick he 
wouldn't pull, from bribing a 
judge to stealing away an employee. And, Mitch, he's a man 



you'll have to watch." 

"Why? I mean, why particularly?" 

Schocken chuckled. "Because 
we stole Ven us from him. It 
wasn't easy to persuade the Government that it should be our 
baby." 

"I see," I said, and I did. Our 
representative government now is 
more representative than it has 
ever been before in history. It is 
not. of course, representative per 
capita, but it most surely is ad 
valorem, which is the only realistic way to govern a country. A 
citizen's vote must be weighed in 
the same way as a member of a 
family exerts influence — according to his wisdom and success. 
His power, in other words. Just 
as the head of a family makes its 
decisions because he bears the 
most responsibility and the ability to enforce his decisions, a 
nation must, obviously, be governed by its leaders. This has always been true in fact. Ours is 
the first civilization, however, 
which admits the reality of the 
situation and applies the correct 
solution with admirably logical 
practicality. 

One thing was bothering me. 
"Won't Taunton be likely to take 
— well, direct action?" 

"Oh. he'll try to steal it back,"* 
Fowler said mildly. 

"That's not what I mean. You 
remember what happened with 



14 




 



Antarctic Exploitation." 

"I was there. A hundred and 
forty casualities on our side. God 
knows what they lost." 

"And that was only one continent. Taunton takes these things 
pretty personally; If he filed a 
feud over that, won't he do it 
for a whole planet?" 

Fowler said patiently, "No, 
Mitch. He wouldn't dare. In the 
first place, industrial feuds are 
expensive. Preliminary hearings 
alone can tie up the whole legal 
staff for weeks, when we get 
through with our injunctions and 
counter-claims. In the second 
place, he doesn't have grounds — 
this is a legal, perfectly openand-aboveboard assignment by 
the Incorporated Government of 
the United States of America ; he 
can't question it. In the third 
place, we'd whip his tail off." 

"I guess you're right," I admitted. It was just as well, as far 
as I'm concerned. Believe me, I'm 
a loyal employee of Fowler 
Shocken Associates; ever since 
cadet days I have tried to live my 
life "for Company and for Sales." 
But industrial feuds can be pretty 
messy. Our profession has been 
comparatively free of them — 
reasonable men can talk these 
things out nine times out of ten. 
But it was only a few decades 
ago, back in 2039, that a small 
but highly effective advertising 
agency in London filed a feud 



against one of our bigger competitors, wiping out every executive 
on the. staff. And they say there 
are still bloodstains on the steps 
of the General Post Office where 
two delivery companies had 
fought it out for the Federal 
Postal Contract, which, like the 
Armed Services, national and 
local police forces and other 
former government agencies, are 
let to private enterprise as they 
should be. 

Schocken was speaking again; 
my attention whipped back. 
"There's one thing you'll have to 
watch for," he cautioned. "This 
is the kind of project that is 
bound to bring out the lunatic 
fringe. Every crackpot organization on the list, from the Connies 
themselves on down, is going to 
come out for or agin it. I don't 
care how you do it, but make sure 
they're all for. Butter them up. 
We don't want them to contend 
with as well as Taunton." 

"Even the Connies?" I asked, 
astonished. 

"Oh, no, Mitch. Don't bother 
with them; they're so discredited 
that they'd be more of a liability." His white hair glinted in the 
lamplight as he bobbed his head. 
"Maybe you could spread the 
word that space -travel is violently opposed to the principles 
of Conservationism. Uses up too 
many raw materials, hurts the 
general living standard — you 



GRAVY PLAN 61 



15 



know, the usual unrealistic line. 
Bring in the fact that rocket fuel 
uses organic material that the 
Connies think should be made 
into fertilizer . . 

I like to watch an expert at 
work. Fowler Schocken laid down 
a whole sub-campaign for me 
right there; I took it down and 
filled in the details. The Conservationists were fair game, those 
wild-eyed zealots who pretended 
that modern scientific method 
was not competent to meet with 
the demands of our expanding 
population and dwindling resources. I had been exposed to 
Connie sentiment in my time, and 
the arguments had always come 
down to one thing: Nature's way 
of living was the right way of 
living. If "Nature" had intended 
us to eat fresh vegetables, it 
wouldn't have given us niacin or 
thiamin chloride. 

I sat still for twenty minutes 
more of Fowler Schocken's inspirational talk, and came away 
with the discovery that I had 
often made before: briefly and 
effectively, he had given me every 
fact and instruction I needed. 
The details he left to me; but I 
knew my job. 

The government wanted Venus 
colonized by Americans. To accomplish this, three things were 
needed: colonists; a way of getting them to Venus: and something for them to do when they 

U 



got there in one piece. 

The first was direct advertising. Schocken's TV commercial 
had blueprinted that, and it 
would be easy. It is always easy 
to persuade men and women — 
particularly American men and 
women who have pioneer blood 
in their veins — that the grass is 
greener far away. I had already 
penciled in a tentative campaign 
with the budget well under a 
megabuck. More would have 
been extravagant. 

The second was only partly our 
problem. The ships had been designed — by Republic Aviation, 
Bell Telephone Labs and U. S. 
Steel, I believe, under Defense 
Corporation contract. Our job 
wasn't to make the transportation to Venus possible, but to 
make it palatable. When your 
wife found her burned-out toaster impossible to replace because 
its nichrome element was part of 
a Venus rocket's main drive jet, 
or when the inevitable disgruntled Congressman for a small and 
frozen-out firm waved an appropriations sheet around his head 
and talked about government 
waste on wildcat schemes, our 
job began: We had to convince 
your wife that rockets are more 
important than toasters; we had 
to convince the Congressman's 
constituent firm that its tactics 
were unpopular and would cost it 
profits. 


 



I thought briefly of an austerity 
campaign and vetoed it. Our 
other accounts would suffer. But 
I needed something that would 
offer vicarious gratification to the 
eight hundred million who would 
not ride the rockets themselves. 

1 tabled that ; Bruner could 
help me there. And I went on 
to point three. There had to be 
something to keep the colonists 
busy on Venus. 

This, I knew, was what Fowler 
Schocken had his eye on. The 
government money that would 
pay for the basic campaign was 
u nice addition to our year's billing, but Fowler Schocken was too 
big for pne-shot accounts. What 
we wanted was the year-afteryear reliability of a major industrial account. 

Fowler, ef course, hoped to 
repeat on an enormously magnified scale our smashing success 
with Indiastries. His boards and 
he had organized all of India into 
a single giant cartel, with every 
last woven basket and iridium ingot it produced sold through 
Fowler Schocken advertising. 
Now he could do the same with 
Venus. Potentially, it was worth 
as much as every dollar of value 
in existence put together! A whole 
new planet, almost the size of 
Earth, in prospect as rich as 
Earth — and every micron, every 
milligram of it ours. 

I looked at my watch. After 



four; my date with Kathy was 
for seven. I just had barely time. 
I dialed Hester and had her get 
me space on the Washington jet 
while I put through a call to the 
name Fowler had given me. The 
name was Jack O'Shea; he was 
the only human being who had 
been to Venus — so far. His voice 
was young and cocky as he made 
an appointment to see me. 

WE were five extra minutes in 
the landing pattern over 
Washington and then there was 
a hassel at the ramp. Brinks Express guards were swarming 
around our plane and their lieutenant demanded identification 
from each emerging passenger. 
When it was my turn, I asked 
what was going on. He looked 
at my low-number Social Security card thoughtfully and then 
saluted. 

"Sorry to bother you, Mr. 
Courtenay," he apologized. "It's 
the Connie bombing near Topeka. We got a tip that the man 
might be aboard the 4:05 New 
York jet. Seems to have been a 
lemon." 

"What Connie bombing was 
this?" 

"DuPont Raw Materials Division — we're under contract for 
their plant protection, you know 
—was opening up a new coal vein 
under some eorhland they own 
out there. They made a nice little

ceremony ©f it, and just as the 
hydraulic mining machine started 
ramming through the topsoil, 
somebody tossed a bomb from 
the crowd. Killed the machine 
operator, his helper and a vice 
president. He slipped away in 
the «:owd, but he was identified. 
We'll get him one of these days." 

"Good luck, Lieutenant," I 
said, and hurried on to the refreshment lounge. 

O'Shea was waiting at a window seat, visibly annoyed, but he 
grinned when 1 apologized. 

"It eould happen to anybody," 
he said, and shrilled at a waiter. 
When we had placed our orders, 
he leaned back and said: "Well?" 

I looked down at him across 
the table and looked away 
through the window. Off to the 
south, the gigantic pylon of the 
Hearst Memorial blinked its 
marker signal ; behind it lay the 
tiny, dulled dome of the old Capitol. I, an ad man, was embarrassed, and O'Shea was enjoying it. 

"Well?" he asked again, quite 
amusedly, and I knew he meant: 
"Now all of you have to come to 
me, and how do you like it for a 
change?" 

I plunged. "I came for information," I said. "For instance: 
what's on Venus?" 

"Sand and smoke," he said 
promptly. "Didn't you read my 
report?" 



"Certainly. I want to know 
more." 

"Everything's in the reptoftt 
Jesus, they kept me in the interrogation room for three solid 
days when I got back! If I left 
anything out, it's gone permanently." 

"That's not what I mean, Jack. 
Who wants to spend his life reading reports? I have fifteen men in 
Research doing nothing but digesting reports for me so I don't 
have to read them. I want to get 
the feel of the planet. There's 
only one place I can get it — because only one man's been there.** 

"And sometimes I wish I had 
not," O'Shea said wearily. "Well, 
where do I start? You know why 
they picked me — the only midget 
in the world with a pilot's license. 
And you know all about the ship. 
And you saw the assay reports on 
the samples 1 brought back. Not 
that they mean much. 1 only 
touched down once and five miles 
away the geology might be entirely different." 

"I know all that. Look, Jack, 
put it this way. Suppose you 
wanted a lot of people to go to 
Venus. What would you tell them 
about it?" 

He laughed. "I'd tell them a 
lot of damn big lies. Start from 
scratch, won't you? What's the 
deal?" 

I gave him a fill-in on what 
Schocken Associates was up to, 



18 




 



while his round little face stared 
at me through his round little 
eyes. There is an opaque quality, 
like porcelain, to the features of 
a midget: as though the destiny 
that had made them small at 
the same time made them more 
perfect and polished than ordinary men, as if to show that 
their lack of size did not mean 
lack of completion. He sipped his 
drink and I gulped mine between paragraphs. 

When my pitch was finished, I 
still didn't know whether he was 
on my side or not. Fowler had 
helped him to capitalize on his 
fame via testimonials, books and 
lectures, so he owed us a little 
gratitude and no more. 

He said: "I wish I could help,** 
and that made things easier. 

"You can/* I told him. "That's 
what I'm here for. Tell me what 
Venus has to offer." » 

"Damn little." A small frown 
chiseled across his lacquer forehead. "Where shall I start? Do 1 
have to tell you about the atmosphere? There's free formaldehyde, you know — embalming 
fluid. Or the heat? It averages 
above the boiling-point of water 
■ — if there was any water on 
Venus, which there isn't. Not accessible, anyhow. Or the winds. I 
clocked five hundred miles an 
hour.** 

"Honestly, Jack, there are answers for all those things. I want 



to get what you thought when 
you were there, how you reacted. 
Just start talking. I'll tell you 
when I've had what I wanted." 

He dented his rose-marble lip 
with his lower teeth. "Well, let's 
start at the beginning. Get us 
another drink, won't you?" 

The waiter took our order and 
came back with the liquor. Jack 
drummed on the table, sipped 
his rhine wine and seltzer, and 
began to talk. 

He started way back, which 
was good. I wanted to know the 
elusive, subjective mood that 
underlay his technical reports on 
the planet Venus, the basic feeling that would put compulsion 
and conviction into the project. 

He told me about his father, 
the six-foot chemical engineer, 
and his mother, the plump, strapping housewife. He made me feel 
their dismay and their ungrudging love for their thirty-five-inch 
son. He had been eleven years 
old when the subject of his adult 
life and work first came up. He 
remembered the unhappiness on 
their faces at his first, inevitable, 
off-hand suggestion about the 
circus. It was no minor tribute 
to them that the subject never 
came up again. It was a major 
tribute that Jack's settled desire 
to learn enough engineering and 
rocketry to be a test pilot had 
been granted, paid for and carried out in the face of every ob

stacle of ridicule and refusal from 
the schools. 

Of course Venus had made it 
all pay off. 

The Venus rocket designers ran 
into one major complication. It 
had been easy enough to get a 
rocket to the Moon, a quartermillion miles away; theoretically, 
it was not much harder to blast 
one across space to the nearest 
other world, Venus. The question 
was one of orbits and time, of 
controlling the ship and bringing 
it back again. 

They could blast the ship to 
Venus in days — at so squandersome a fuel expenditure that ten 
ships couldn't carry enough. Or 
they could ease it to Venus along 
its natural orbits as you might 
float a barge down a gentle river 
— which saved fuel, but lengthened the trip to months. A man 
in that length of time eats twice 
his own weight in food, breathes 
nine times his weight of air and 
drinks water enough to float a 
yawl. Closing the eyefe with 
waste products is the answer, of 
course — only the equipment 
weighs more than the food, air 
and water. So the human pilot 
was out. 

A team of designers went to 
work on an automatic pilot. 
When it was done it worked 
pretty well, and weighed four 
and one -half tons in spite of 
printed circuits and relays con


structed under a microscope. The 
project stopped right there until 
somebody thought of that most 
perfect servo-mechanism: a sixty 
pound midget. A third of a man 
in weight. Jack O'Shea ate a third 
of the food, breathed a third of 
the oxygen. With minimumweight, low -efficiency water- and 
air-purifiers. Jack came in just 
under the limit and thereby won 
himself undying fame. 

He said broodingly, a little 
drunk from the impact of two 
weak drinks on his small frame: 
"They put me into the rocket 
like a finger into a glove. I guess 
you know what the ship looked 
like. But did you know they zipped me into the pilot's seat? It 
wasn't a chair, more like a diver's 
suit; the only air on the ship 
was in that suit: the only water 
came in through a tube to my 
lips. Saved weight . . .** 

And the next eighty days were 
in that suit. It fed him, gave him 
water, removed his wastes. If 
necessary, it would have shot 
novocaine into a broken arm, 
tourniquetted a cut femoral artery or pumped air for a torn 
lung. It was a placenta, and a 
hideously uncomfortable one. 

In the suit thirty-three days 
going, forty-one coming back. 
The six days in between were 
the justification for the trip. 

Jack fought his ship down 
through absolute blindness: gas

clouds that closed his own eyes 
and confused the radar, down to 
the skin of an unknown world. 
He was within a thousand feet of 
the ground before he could see 
anything but swirling yellow. 
And then he landed and cut the 
rockets. 

"Well. I couldn't get out. of 
course," he went on. "For forty 
or fifty reasons, somebody else 
will have to be the first man to 
set foot on Venus. Somebody who 
doesn't care much about breathing, I guess. Anyway, there I was, 
looking at it." He shrugged his 
shoulders, looked baffled. "I've 
told it a dozen times at lectures, 
but I've never got it over. I tell 
'em the closest thing to it on 
Earth was the Painted Desert. 
Maybe it was; I haven't been 
there. 

"The wind blows hard on 
Venus and it tears up the rocks. 
Soft rocks blow away and make 
dust storms. The hard ones — 
well, they stick out in funny 
shapes and colors. Big monument things, some of them. And 
the most jagged hilts and crevasses you can imagine. It's something like the inside of a cave, 
sort of, only not dark. But the 
light is — funny. Nobody ever saw 
light like that on Earth. Orangybrownish light, brilliant, very 
brilliant, but sort of threatening. 
Like the way the sky is threatening in the summer around sun


set just before a smasher of a 
thunderstorm. Only there never 
is any thunderstorm because 
there isn't a drop of water 
around." 

He hesitated. "There is lightning. Plenty of it, but never any 
rain ... I don't know, Mitch," 
he said abruptly. "Am I being 
any help to you at all?" 

I looked at my watch and saw 
that the return jet was about to 
leave, so I bent down and turned 
off the recorder in my briefcase. 
(Turned, nor clicked. Mercury 
switches.) 

"You're being lots of help, 
Jack," I said. "But I'll need more. 
And I have to go now. Look, can 
you come up to New York and 
work with me for a while? I've 
got everything you said on tape, 
but I want visual stuff, too. Our 
artists can work from the pix 
you brought back, but there must 
be more. And you're a lot more 
use than the photographs for 
what we need." I didn't mention 
that the artists would be drawing impressions of what Venus 
would look like, if it were different from what it was. "How 
about it?" 

Jack leaned back and looked 
cherubic, but, though he made 
me sweat through a brief recap 
of the extensive plans his lecture 
agent had made for his next few 
weeks, he finally agreed. The 
Shriners' talk could be canceled.

he decided, and the appointments 
with his ghost writers could be 
kept as well in New York as in 
Washington. We made a date for 
the following day just as the PA 
system announced that my flight 
was ready. 

"I'll walk you to the plane," 
Jack offered. He slipped down 
from the chair and threw a bill 
on the table for the waiter. 

We walked together through 
the narrow aisles of the bar out 
into the field. Jack grinned and 
strutted a little at some exclamations that went up as he was 
recognized. The field was almost 
dark, and the glow of Washing

ton backlighted the silhouettes 
of hovering aircraft. Drifting toward us from the freight terminal 
was a huge cargo 'copter, a fiftytonner, its cargo nacelle gleaming 
in colors as it reflected the lights 
below. It was no more than a

bad to clutch my hat against the 
downdraft from its whirling 
vanes. 

"Damn-fool bus drivers. 1 ' Jack 
grunted, glaring up at the "copter. "They ought to put those 
things on G.C.A. Just because 
they're maneuverable, those fanjockies think they can take them

cartons of Starrzclius Verily food 
packets. One of the crimson 
cylinders rolled to my toes and 
I stupidly picked it up and 
looked at it. 

Overhead, the lightened 'copter 
fluttered up and away, but I 
didn't see it go. 

"For God's sake, get it off 
them!" Jack was shrilling, tugging at me. We had not been 
alone on the field. From under 
the buckled aluminum reached 
an arm holding a briefcase, and 
through the compound noises in 
my ears I could hear a bubbling 
sound of human pain. I let Jack 
pull me to the tangled metal and 
we tried to heave it. I got a 
scratched hand and tore my 
jacket, and then the airport people got there and brusquely ordered us away. 

I don't remember walking 
there, but by and by I found 
that I was sitting on someone's 
suitcase, back against the wall 
of the terminal, with Jack O'Shea 
talking excitedly to me. He was 
cursing all cargo 'copter pilots 
and blackguarding me for standing there like a fool when he'd 
seen the nacelle clamps opening, 
and a great deal more that I 
didn't get. I remember him 
knocking the red box of breakfast 
food from my hand impatiently. 
The company psychologists say 
I am not unusually sensitive or 
timorous, but I was in a state of 



shock that lasted until Jack was 
loading me into my plane. 

Later on, the hostess told me 
five people had been caught under 
the nacelle, and the whole affair 
seemed to come into focus. But 
not until we were halfway back 
to New York. At the time all I 
remembered, all that seemed important, was Jack saying over 
and over, bitterness and anger 
written on his porcelain face: 
"Too damn many people, Mitch. 
Too damn much crowding. I'm 
with you every inch of the way. 
We need Venus, Mitch, we need

I pressed the button over the

remembering that it had once

smiled at her as she opened the

She unsmilingly said two 
things: "You're late, Mitch," and, 
"I thought you were going to call 
first." 

I walked in and sat down. "I 
was late because I almost got 
killed and I didn't call because 
I was late. Does that square us?*'

She asked the question I 
wanted her to ask and I told her 
how close I had come to death 
that evening. 

Kathy is a beautiful woman 
with a warm, friendly face, her 
hair always immaculately done 
in two tones of blonde, her eyes 
usually smiling. I, have spent a 
great deal of time looking at her, 
but I never watched more attentively than when I told her 
about the cargo nacelle near-miss. 

It was, on the whole, disappointing. She was really concerned for me, beyond doubt. But 
Kathy's heart opens to all people 
and I saw nothing in her face 
to make me feel that she cared 
more for me than anyone else. 

So I told her my other big 
news, the Venus account and my 
stewardship of it. It was more 
successful; she was startled and 
excited and happy, and kissed me 
in a flurry of good feeling. But 
when I kissed her back, as I'd 
been wanting to do for months, 
she drew away and went to sit 
on the other side of the room, 
ostensibly to dial a drink. 

"You rate a toast," she said. 
"Champagne at the least. Mitch, 
it's wonderful news!" 

1 seized the chance. "Will you 
help me celebrate? Really celebrate?" 

Her brown eyes were wary. 
"Urn," she said. "Sure I wilt. 
We'll do the town together — my 



treat and no arguments about it. 
The only thing is, I'll have to 
leave you punctually at 2400. 
I'm spending the night in the 
hospital. I've a hysterectomy to 
do in the morning and I mustn't 
get to sleep too late. Or too 
drunk, either." 

But she smiled. 

Once again I decided not to 
push my luck too far. "Great," 
I said, and I wasn't faking. Kathy 
is a wonderful girl to do the town 
with. "Let me use your phone?" 

By the time wc had our drinks, 
I had arranged for tickets to a 
show, a dinner table and a reservation for a nightcap afterward. 

Kathy looked a little dubious. 
"It's a pretty crowded program 
for five hours, Mitch," she said. 
"My hysterectomy isn't going to 
like it if my hand shakes." But I 
talked her out of it. Kathy is 
more resilient than that. Once 
she did a complete trepan the 
morning after we'd spent the entire night screaming out our 
tempers at each other, and it 
had gone perfectly. 

^T*HE dinner, for me, was a 
failure. I don't pretend to be 
an epicure who can't stand anything but new protein. I definitely 
am, however, a guy who gets sore 
when he pays new-protein prices 
and gets generated protein instead. The texture of the shashlik we both ordered was all right.

but you can't hide the taste. I 
scratched the restaurant off my 
list and apologized to Kathy for 
it. But she laughed it off and the 
Show afterward was fine. Hypnotics often give me a headache, 
but I slipped right into the trance 
state this time as soon as the film 
began and was none the worse 
for it later. 

The night club was packed and 
the headwaiter had made a mistake in the time for our reservations. We had to wait five minutes 
in the anteroom, and Kathy 
shook her head very decisively 
when I pleaded for an extension 
on the curfew. But when the 



headwaiter showed us with the 
fanciest apologies and bows to 
our places at the bar and our 
drinks came, she leaned over and 
kissed me again. I felt just fine. 

"Thanks," she said. "That was 
a wonderful evening, Mitch. Get 
promoted often, please. I like it." 

I struck a cigarette for her and 
one for myself, and somebody 
behind us began to holler: "You 
fools! It's not too late I" 

We turned and gaped. It was a 
gaunt, wild-eyed youngster in the 
entrance of the night club, waving his arms and yelling: "Look 
at yourselves, you fools! The air 
is blue with your smoke! You're 




 




burning up and throwing away 
the product of land that should 
be growing food!" 

A flying squad of waiters 
headed his way suddenly stopped and disintegrated into very 
scared individuals. He had a pistol in his hand. 

"Don't stop .me!" he shouted 
hoarsely. "I don't want to hurt 
anybody, but I must bring you 



my message. It's not too late ! 
Stop your smoking! Stop your 
drinking! Don't you know there 
are starving children in this 
world? How dare you drink alcohol made from grain? Think 
of the evil and folly of it! Give 
up your wickedness! Turn Connie and learn what peace of mind 
is like! It's not too — " 

He hadn't guarded his back. 
Two or three bluecoats of the 
Metropolitan Protection Corporation were standing over his lank 
body. 

Kathy yelled: "Gangway! I'm 
a doctor!" put her head down and 
charged through the milling

crowd. When I reached her side, 
she was saying to the M.P.C. 
foreman: "Killed instantly." 

"Thanks, miss," the foreman 
said modestly. "It was just my 
duty. Any good protection man 
could have done as well." 

"I didn't — " she began, and 
tfu-n sighed. "Mitch, shall we 
get back to the bar? We must 
have time for another drink." 

We got our places back and 
ordered again. "What a hell of 
a thing to happen." I said, angry 
that the young lunatic had 
chosen to mess up our evening. 

"I absolutely do not want to 
talk or think about it," Kathy 
said. "Make me forget. What 
were we talking about?" 

"Well, I was going to say that 
we always have fun together." 

"And I was going to say that 
I knew what you were leading 
up to and that the answer still 
was no." 

"I know you "were," I said 
glumly. "Let's get out of here." 

She paid the tab and we left, 
inserting our anti-soot plugs as 
we hit the street. 

"Cab, sir?" asked the doorman. 

"Yes, please," Kathy answered. 
"A tande'm." 

He whistled up a two -man 
pedicab and Kathy gave the lead 
boy the hospital's address. "You 
can come if you like, Mitch," she 
said, and I climbed in beside her. 
The doorman gave us a starting 



push and the cabbies grunted 
getting up momentum. 

For a moment it was like our 
courtship again: the friendly 
dark, the slight, musty smell of 
the canvas top, the squeak of the 
springs. But for a moment only. 

"Watch what you're going to 
say, Mitch," she warned. 

"Please, Kathy, let me go 
through it anyhow. It won't take 
long. Wc were married eight 
months ago — all right," I said 
quickly as she started to object. 
"It wasn't an absolute marriage. 
But we took the interlocutory 
vows. Do you remember why we 
did that?" 

She said patiently after a moment: "We were in love." 

"I loved you and you loved 
me. And we both had our work 
to think about, and we knew that 
sometimes it made us a little 
hard to get along with. So we 
made it interim. It had a year 
to run before we had to decide 
whether to make it permanent." 
I touched her hand and she did 
not move it away. "Kathy dear, 
don't you think we knew what 
we were doing then? Can't we at 
least give it the year's trial? 
There are still four months to 
go". Let's try it. If the year ends 
and you don't want to file your 
certificate — well, I won't be able 
to ny you didn't give me a 
chance. As for me. I don't have 
to wait. My certificate's on file 




 



now and I won't change." 

We passed a street light and 
I saw her Hps twisted into an 
expression I couldn't quite read. 

"Oh, damn it all, Mitch," she 
said unhappily, "I know you 
won't change. Must I call you 
names to convince you that it's 
hopeless? I used to think you 
were a sweet guy, an idealist who 
cared for principles and ethics 
instead of money. You told me 
so yourself, very convincingly. 
You were very plausible about 
my work, too. You boned up on 
medicine, you came to watch me 
operate three times a week, you 
told all our friends how proud 
you were to be married to a surgeon. It took me three months to 
find out what you meant by that. 
Anybody could marry a girl 
who'd be a housewife. But it 
took a Mitchell Courtenay to 
marry a star class surgeon and 
make her a housewife." 

Her voice was tremulous. "I 
couldn't take it, Mitch. I never 
will be able to. Not the arguments, the sulkiness and the everand-ever fighting. I'm a doctor. 
Sometimes a life depends on me. 
If I'm all torn up inside from 
battling with my husband, that 
life isn't safe. Can't you see that?" 

I asked quietly: "Kathy, don't 
you still love me?" 

She was absolutely quiet for 
a long moment. Then she laughed 
wildly and very briefly. "Here's 



the hospital, Mitch. It's midnight." 

We climbed out. "Wait," I 
growled at the lead boy, and 
walked with her to the door. She 
wouldn't kiss me good night and 
she wouldn't make a date to see 
me again. I stood in the lobby 
for twenty minutes to make sure 
she was really staying there that 
night, and then got into the cab 
to go to the nearest shuttle station. I was in a vile mood. It 
wasn't helped any when the lead 
boy asked innocently after I paid 
him off : "Say, mister, what does 
idealist mean? Was the dame an 
eye doctor?" 

" 'Idealist' is Spanish for 'mind 
your own business,' " I told him 
evenly. On the shuttle I wondered 
sourly how rich I'd have to be 
before I could buy privacy. 

The slain Connie rankled, too. 
They seemed to be capable of 
anything you can name in the 
way of damn-foolishness, but this 
was the first time I'd heard that 
they were against smoking and 
drinking. Hell, there was no real 
grain used in whisky. Maybe he 
wasn't a real Connie, just a crackbrained kid who thought he was. 
There were such idiots. And there 
were other people who weren't 
Connies and who didn't think 
they were Connies, but who got 
scragged for being Connies anyway. And there were borderline 
cases where you could never be 



CtAVY PLANET 



a* 



sure. University teachers caught 
with a well -warn copy of Our 
Plundered Planet. They always 
satd they had only a scholarly 
interest in it, of course. Just what 
you'd expect them to say, Connie or not. And naturally the 
Connies would try to plant people in universities where they 
could influence the young and 
make recruits. Better be safe than 
sorry — or was it? 

I thought of old man Hollister. 
I was pretty sure he was a sound 
man, but a whispering campaign 
swept Schocken Associates, complete with all sorts of very circumstantial anecdotes, the kind 
of thing you couldn't make up. 
He resigned after about three 
months of it and died shortly 
afterward, Hollister didn't look 
as if he were capable of blowing 
up a DDT factory or garotting a 
hydraulic mine operator or burning down a penicillin warehouse. 
But somebody did these things. 
Presumably somebody as innocent-looking as Hollister. 

Damn them all! I might have 
gone home with Kathy if that kid 
hadn't got himself killed! 

Tl/TY temper was no better when 
L * " I arrived at the office next 
morning. It took all Hester's tact 
to keep me from biting her head 
off in the first few minutes, and 
it was by the grace of God that 
it was not a Board morning. After 



I'd got my mail and the overnight accumulation of inter-office 
memos, Hester intelligently disappeared for a while. When she 
came back, she brought me a cup 
of coffee — authentic plantationgrown coffee. 

"The matron in the ladies* 
room brews it on the sly," she 
explained. "Usually she won't let 
us take it out because she's afraid 
of the Coffiest team. But now 
that you're star class — " 

I thanked her and gave her 
Jack O'Shea's tape to put through 
channels. Then I went to work. 

First came the matter of the 
sampling area, and a headache 
with Matt Runstead. He's Market Research, so I had to work 
with and through him. But he 
didn't show any inclination to 
work with me. I put a map of 
Southern California in the projector while Matt and two of his 
helpers boredly sprinkled cigarette ashes on my floor. 

Witli the pointer, I outlined 
the test areas and controls: "San 
Diego through Tijuana; half the i 
communities around L. A. and 
the lower tip of Monterrey. Those 
will be controls. The rest of CalMexico, from L.A. down, we'll 
use for tests. You'll have to be 
on the scene, I guess, Matt; I'd 
recommend our Diego offices as 
headquarters. Harris is in charge 
there and he's a pretty good 
man." 



30 




 



Runstead grunted. "Not a flake 
of snow from year's end to year's 
end. Couldn't sell an overcoat 
there if you threw in a slave girl 
as a premium. Why don't you 
leave market research to somebody who knows something about 
it? Don't you see how climate 
nulls your sigma?" 

The younger of his stampedout-of-tin assistants started to 
back the boss up, but I cut him 
off . Runstead had to be consulted 
on test areas — it was his job — 
but Venus was my project and 
I was going to run it. 

I said, .sounding just a little 
nasty: "Regional and world income, age, density of population, 
health, psyche-friction, age-group 
distribution and mortality causes 
and rates are seven-place sigmas, 
Matt. Cal-Mex was designed personally by God Himself as a perfect testing area. In a tiny 
universe of less than a hundred 
million, it duplicates every important segment of North America. I 
will not change my project and 
we are going to stick to the area 
/ indicated." 

"It won't work. The temperature is the major factor. Anybody 
should be able to see that." 

"I'm not just anybody, Matt. 
I'm the guy in charge." 

Matt Runstead stubbed out his 
cigarette and got up. "Let's go 
talk to Fowler," he said and 
walked out. There wasn't any
GRAVY PLANET 



thing for me to do except follow 
him. 

As I left, I heard the older of 
his helpers picking up the phone 
to notify Fowler Schocken's secretary that we were coming. He 
had a team all right. I spent a 
little time wondering how I could 
build one like that myself before 
t got down to the business of 
planning how to put it to Fowler. 

But Fowler Schocken has a 
surefire technique of handling interstaff hassels. He worked it on 
us. When we came in, he said exuberantly: "The two men I want 
to see! Matt, can you put out a 
fire for me? It's the A.I.G. people. 
They claim our handling of the 
PregNot account is hurting their 
trade. They're talking about 
going over to Taunton unless we 
drop PregNot. Their billing isn't 
much, but a birdie told me that 
Taunton put the idea into their 
heads." 

He went on to explain the intricacies of our relationship with 
the American Institute of Gynecologists. I listened only halfheartedly ; our ''Babies without 
Maybes" campaign on their sexdetermination project had given 
them at least a twenty per cent 
plus on the normal birthrate. 
They should be solidly ours after 
that. 

Runstead said : "They don't 
have a case, Fowler. We sell 
liquor and hangover remedies 

31 



both. They've got no business 
yelling about any other account. 
Besides, what does this have to 
dc with Market Research?" 

Fowler chuckled happily. 
"They'll expect the account executives to give them the usual 
line — but instead we'll let you 
handle them yourself. Snow them 
under with a whole line of charts 
and statistics to prove that PregNot never prevents a couple from 
having a baby; it just permits 
them to postpone it until they 
can afford to do the job right. 
In other words, their unit of sale 
goes up and their volume stays 
the same. And it'll be one in the 
eye for Taunton. Lawyers get 
disbarred for representing conflicting interests; we've got to 
make sure that any attempt to 
foist the same principle on our 
profession is nipped in the bud. 
Think you can handle it for the 
old man. Matt?" 

"Sure," Runstead grumbled. 
"What about Venus?" 

Fowler twinkled at me. "What 
about it, Mitch? Can you spare 
Matt for a while?" 

"Forever," I said. "In fact, 
that's what I came to see you 
about. Matt's scared of Southern 
California." 

Runstead belligerently dropped 
his cigarette and let it lie, crisping the nylon pile of Fowler's 
rug. "What am I supposed to be 
scared of?" 



"Ensy." said Fowler. "Matt 
isn't scared. Let's hear him out." 

Runstead glowered at me. "All 
I said was that Southern California isn't the right test area. 
What's the big difference between 
Venus and here? Heat! We need 
a test area with continentalaverage climate. A New Englander might be attracted by the 
heat on Venus; a Tijuana man, 
never. It's too damn hot in CalMex already." 

"Urn," said Fowler Schocken. 
"Tell you what, Matt. This needs 
going into, and you'll want to 
get busy on the A.I.G. thing. Pick 
out a good man to vice you on 
the Venus section while you're 
out and we'll have it hashed over 
at the section meeting tomorrow 
afternoon. Meanwhile — " He 
glanced at his desk clock — "Senator Danton has been waiting for 
seven minutes. All right?" 

It was clearty not all right with 
Matt, and I felt cheered for the 
rest of the day. 

rpHINGS went well enough. 

Development came in with a 
report on what they'd gleaned 
from O'Shea's tape and all the 
other available material. The 
prospects for manufacture were 
there. Quick, temporary ones like 
little souvenir globes of Venus 
manufactured from the organics 
floating around in what we laughingly called the "air" of Venus. 




 



Long-term ones — an assay had 
indicated pure iron: not ninenines pure and not ninety-nine 
nines pure, but absolute iron that 
nobody would ever find or make 
on' an oxygen planet like Earth. 
The labs would pay well for it. 
And Development had not developed, but found a remarkable little thing called a high-speed 
Hilsch Tube. Using no power, it 
could refrigerate the pioneers' 
homes by using the hot tremendous winds of Venus themselves. 
It was a simple thing that had 
been lying around since 1943. 
Nobody had had any use for it, 
because nobody had had that 
kind of wind to play with before. 

Tracy Collier, the Development 
liaison man with Venus Section, 
tried also to tell me about nitrogen-fixing catalysts. I nodded 
from time to time and gathered 
that sponge-platinum "sown" on 
Venus would, in conjunction with 
the continuous, terrific lightning, 
cause it to "snow" nitrates and 
"rain" hydrocarbons, purging the 
atmosphere of formaldehyde and 
ammonia. 

"Expensive?" I asked cautiously. 

"As expensive as you want it 
fn he," he said. "The platinum 
doesn't get used up, you know. 
Use one gram and-take a million 
years or more. Use more platinum and take less time." 

I didn't really understand, but 



obviously it was good news. I 
patted him and sent him on his 
way. 

Industrial Anthropology gave 
me a setback. Ben Winston complained: "You can't make people 
want to live in a steam-heated 
sardine can. All our folkways are 
against it. Who's going to travel 
sixty million milts for a chance 
to spend the rest of his life cooped 
up in a tin shack — when he can 
stay right here on Earth and have 
corridors, elevators, streets, roofs, 
all the wide-open space a man 
could want? It's against human 
nature, Mitch!" 

He went on trlling me about 
the American way of life — walked 
to the window with me and 
pointed out at the hundreds of 
acres of rooftops where men and 
women could walk around in the 
open air, wea ri n g si mple soot extractor plugs in their nostrils 
instead of a bulky oxygen helmet. 

Finally I got mad. I said: 
"Somebody must want to go to 
Venus. Otherwise why would they 
buy Jack O'Shea's book the way 
they do? Why would the voters 
stand still for a billion-and-up 
appropriation to build the rocket ? 
God knows I shouldn't have to 
lead you by the nose this way, 
but here's what you are going to 
do: Survey the book-buyers, the 
repeat -viewers of O'Shea's TV 
shows, the ones who come early 
to his lectures and stand around 



CRAVY PLANET 



C'3 



talking in the lobby after. Find 
out about the Moon colony— 
what types they have there. And 
then we'll know who to aim our 
ads at. Any arguments?" 
There weren't. 

Hester had done wonders of 
scheduling that first day and I 
made progress with every section 
head involved. She couldn't read 
my paper work for me, though, 
and by quitting time I had six 
inches of it stacked by my right 
arm. Hester volunteered to stay 
with me, but there wasn't really 
anything for her to do. I let her 
bring me sandwiches and another 
cup of coffee, and chased her 
home. 

IT was after eleven by the time 
I was done. I stopped off in 
an all-night diner on the fifteenth 
floor before heading home. It was 
a wiadowless box of a place where 
the coffee smelled of the yeast it 
was made from and the ham in 
my sandwich bore the taint of 
soy. But it was only a minor annoyance and out of my mind 
when I got home. For as I opened 
the door to my apartment, there 
was a snick and an explosion, 
and something slammed into the 
door frame by my head. I ducked 
and yelled. Outside the window, 
a figure dangling from a rope 
ladder drifted away, a gun in its 
hand. 

I was stupid enough to run 



over to the window and gawk out 
at the helicopter- borne figure. I 
would have been a perfect target 
if it had been steady enough to 
shoot at me again, but it luckily 
wasn't. 

Surprised at my calm, I called 
the Metropolitan Protection Corporation. 

"Are you a subscriber, sir?" 
their operator asked. 

"Yes, dammit. For six years. 
Get a squad over here!" 

"One mo-ment, Mr. Courtenay. . . , Mr. Mitchell Courtenay? Copysmith, star class?" 

"Will you kindly get a man 
over here before the character 
who just took a shot at me comes 
back?" 

"I have your record before me, 
sir. I am sorry, but your account 
is canceled. We do not accept star 
class accounts at the general rate 
because of the risk of industrial 
feuds, sir." She named a figure 
that made each separate hair on 
my head stand on end. "There 
is," she said helpfully, "a rebate 
due you on the unexpired portion 
of your previous policy." 

"Thanks," I said heavily, and 
rang off. I put the ProgramPrinting to Quarry Machinery 
reel of the Telephone Red Book 
into the reader and spun it to 
Protective Agencies. I got turndowns from three or four and 
finally one sleepy -sounding private detective agreed to come on 



34 




 



over for a stiff fee. 

He showed up in half an hour 
and I paid him, and all he did 
was annoy me with unanswerable 
questions and look for nonexistent fingerprints. After a 
while he went away, saying he'd 
work on it. 

I got to bed and eventually to 
sleep with one of the unanswered 
questions chasing itself around 
and around in my head: 

Who would want to shoot a 
simple, harmless advertising man 
like me? 

IV 

¥ TOOK my courage in my 
■ hands and walked briskly 
down the hall to Fowler Schocken's office. He might throw me 
out of the office for asking, but 
I needed an answer and he might 
have it. ' 

Ahead of me, his door opened 
explosively and Tildy Mathie 
lurched out. She stared at me, 
but I'll take commercial oath 
she didn't know my name. 

"Rewrites," she said wildly. "I 
slave my heart out for that whitehaired old rat, and what does he 
give me? Rewrites. 'This is good 
copy, but I want better than good 
copy from you,' he says. 'Rewrite 
it/ he says. 'I want drive, and 
beauty, and humble, human 
warmth, and ecstasy and all the 
tender, sad emotion of your sweet 



womanly heart,' he says, 'and I 
want it in fifteen words.' I'll give 
him fifteen words!" she sobbed, 
and pushed past me down the 
hall. "But they won't be sweet or 
womanly!" 

I cleared my throat, knocked 
once and walked into Fowler's 
office. There was no hint of hia 
brush with Tildy in the smile he 
gave me. In fact, his pink, cleareyed face belied my suspicions, 
but — I had been shot at. 

'Til only be a minute, Fowler," I said. "I want to know 
whether you've been playing 
rough with Taunton Associates." 

"I always play rough," he 
twinkled. "Rough, but clean." 

"I mean very, very rough and 
very, very dirty. Have you, by 
any chance, tried to have any of 
their people shot?" 

"Mitch! Really r 

"I'm asking," I went on doggedly, "because last night a 
'copter-borne marksman tried to 
plug me when I came home. I 
can't think of any angle except 
retaliation from Taunton." 

"Scratch Taunton," he said 
positively. 

I took a deep breath. "Fowler,** 
I said, "man-to-man, you haven't 
been Notified? I may be out of 
line, but I've got to ask. It isn't 
just me. It's the Venus Project." 

There were no apples in Fowler's cheeks at that moment, and 
I could see in his eyes that my 



GRAVY PLANET 



3S 



Job and my sttft-class rating hung 
in the balance. 

He said: "Mitch, I made you 
star class because I thought you 
could handle the responsibilities 
that came with it. It isn't just the 
work. I know you can do that. 
I thought you could live up to 
the commercial code as well." 

I hung on. "Yes, sir," I said. 

He sat down and lit a Starr. 
After just exactly the right splitsecond of hesitation, he pushed 
the pack to me. "Mitch," he said. 
"You're a youngster, Mitch, only 
star class a short time. But you've 
got power. Five words from you, 
and in a matter of weeks or 
months, half a million consumers 
will find their lives completely 
changed. That's power, Mitch, 
absolute power. And you know 
the old saying. Power ennobles. 
Absolute power ennobles absolutely." 

"Yes, sir," I said. I knew all 
the old sayings. I also knew that 
he was going to answer my question eventually. 

"Ah, Mitch." he said dreamily, 
waving his cigarette, "we have 
our prerogatives and our duties 
and our particular hazards. You 
can't have one without the others. 
If we didn't have feuds, the whole 
system of checks and balances 
would be thrown out of gear." 

"Fowler," I said, greatly daring, "you know I have no complains about the system. It 



works; that's all you have to say 
for it. I know we need feuds. And 
it stands to reason that if Taunton files a feud against us, you've 
got to live up to the code. You 
can't broadcast the information; 
every executive in the shop would 
be diving for cover instead of getting work done. But — Venus 
Project is in my head, Fowler. I 
can handle it better that way. If 
I write everything down, it slows 
things up." 

"Of course," he said. 

"Suppose you were Notified 
and suppose I'm the first one 
Taunton knocks oft' — what happens to Venus Project?" 

"You may have a point." he 
admitted. "I'll level with you, 
Mitch. There has been no Notification." 

"Thanks, Fowler," I said sincerely. "I did get shot at. And 
that accident in Washington — 
maybe it wasn't an accident. You 
don't imagine Taunton would try 
anything without Notifying you, 
do you?" 

"I haven't provoked them to 
that extent, and they'd never do 
a thing like that anyhow. They're 
cheap, they're crooked, but they 
know the rules of the game. Killing in an industrial feud is a misdemeanor. Killing without Notification is a commercial offense. 
And that means — " 

I nodded. "Cerebrin." 

Fowler beamed. "What I like 



34 




 



about you, Mitch, is you can face 
facts. No pussy-footing; call a 
spade a spade. Well," he said 
cheerfully, "I'm sorry I can't help 
you out. You haven't been getting 
into any of the wrong beds, shall 
I say?" 

"No," I said. "My life's been 
very dull. The whole thing's 
crazy. It must have been a mistake. But I'm glad that whoeverit-was couldn't shoot." 

"So am I, Mitch, so am I! You 
saw O'Shea?" He had already 
dismissed the shooting from his 
mind. 

"I did. He's coming up here 
today. He'll be working closely 
With me." 

"Splendid! Some of that glory 
will rub off on Fowler Schocken 
Associates if we play our cards 
right. Dig into it, Mitch. I don't 
have to tell you how." 

It was a dismissal. 

/"VSHEA was waiting in the 
anteroom of my office. It 
wasn't an ordeal; most of the female personnel was clustered 
around him as he sat perched on 
a desk, talking gruffly and 
authoritatively. There was no 
mistaking the looks in their eyes. 
He was a thirty-five-inch midget, 
but he had money and fame, the 
two things we drill and drill into 
the population. O'Shea could 
have taken his pick of them. I 
wondered how many he had 

It A V Y PLANET 



picked since his return to fiarth 
in a blaze of glory. 

We run a taut office, but the 
girls didn't scatter until I cleared 
my throat. 

"Morning, Mitch," O'Shea said. 
"You over your shock?" 

"Sure. And I ran right into 
another one. Somebody tried to 
shoot me." I told the story and 
he grunted thoughtfully. 

"Have you considered getting 
a bodyguard?" he asked. 

"Of course. But I won't. It 
must have been a mistake." 

"Like that cargo nacelle?" 

I paused. "What's on your 
mind? I can't be down in anybody's little black book. Jack. 
The stakes are too high. Fowler's 
ruled out retaliation, and unprovoked murder for business advantage — " I lowered my voice — 
"means cerebrin for five seconds 
and gas." 

He made a soundless whistle 
and we went into my office. When 
the door closed, he said: "I never 
heard that. About you-know." 

"Well, keep it quiet. You can 
tell anyoody with good sense, 
somebody upstairs commercially, 
because they probably know it 
already. But the consumers 
wouldn't understand. It's been 
that way for years. The corporations got fed up with undercover 
business assassinations and put 
an amendment through Congress 
authorizing the use of several 

S7 



pharmaceutical preparations in 
connection with capital punishment. Cerebrin's in the list, buried 
under an obscure name. Everybody who ought to know about 
it knows. Result, no more killings." 

He nodded. "Five seconds is 
what?" 

"One quarter of the first phase. 
Roughly equivalent to being 
sandpapered all over your body, 
blinded with a million-power 
searchlight, deafened by a two 
hundred-decibel siren, and strangled by hydrogen sulfide continuously for fifteen years. Care to 
try some?" 

"Thanks very much, but no, 
thanks." 

"That's the way everybody 
feels. I fed your tape to — " 

His mind was still on the drug. 
"I've heard about the second 
phase," he said tentatively. 

"Classified information." 

O'Shca grinned. "You can't 
pull that on me, Mitch. What 
you should have said was : 
'Frankly, Jack, I don't know a 
thing about it.' Now give!" 

"You've got me, but all this 
strikes me as unnecessarily morbid. Well, people have come back 
from very light dosages of the 
first phase — most of them broken, 
some of them only very badly 
bent. Nobody's come back from 
the whole twenty seconds. Jack, 
can we please get off this sub


ject? It gives me the horrors." 
- "Permission granted," he 
beamed. "Now, let's go to work 
— but on what?" 

"First, words. We want words 
that are about Venus, words 
that'll tickle people. Make them 
sit up. Make them muse about 
change, and space, and distant 
planets. Words to make them a 
little discontented with what they 
are and a little hopeful about 
what they might be. Words to 
make them feel noble about feeling the way they do, and not 
foolish. Words that will do all 
these things and also make them 
happy about the existence of Indiastries and Starrzelius Verily 
and Fowler Schocken Associates. 
Words that will do all these 
things and also make them feel 
unhappy about the existence of 
Universal Products and Taunton 
Associates." 

He was staring at me with his 
mouth open. "You serious?" he 
finally exclaimed. 

"You're on the inside now. 
That's the way we work. That's 
the way we worked on you." 

"What are you talking about?" 
he demanded. 

"You're wearing Starrzelius 
Verily clothes and shoes, Jack. 
It means wc got you. Taunton 
and Universal worked on you, 
Starrzelius and Schocken worked 
on you, and you chose Starrzelius. Schocken reached you. 



36 




 



Smoothly, without ever bei ng 
aware that it was happening, you 
became persuaded that there was 
something rather nice about 
Starrzelius clothes and shoes, and 
that there was something rather 
not-nice about Universal clothes 
and shoes." 

"I never read the ads," he said 
defiantly. 

"Our ultimate triumph is 
wrapped up in that statement." 

"I solemnly promise," O'Shea 
said, "that as soon as I get back 
to my hotel room-, I'll send my 
clothes down the incinerator 
chute — " 

"Luggage, too?" I asked. 
"'Starrzelius luggage?" 

He looked startled for a moment and then regained his calm. 
"Starrzelius luggage, too," he 
said. "And then I'll pick up the 
phone and order a complete set 
of Universal luggage and apparel. 
And you can't stop me." 

"I wouldn't think of stopping 
you. It means more business for 
Starrzelius. Tell you what you're 
going to do: You'll get your complete set of Universal luggage 
and apparel. You'll wear it for 
a while with a vague, submerged 
discontent. It's going to work on 
your libido, because our ads for 
Starrzelius have convinced you 
that it isn't quite virile to buy 
from any other firm. Your selfesteem will suffer; deep down, 
you'll know that you're not wear


ing the best. Your subconscious 
won't stand up under much of 
that. You'll find yourself 'losing' 
bits of Universal apparel. You'll 
find yourself 'accidentally' putting your foot through the cuff of 
your Universal pants. You'll find 
yourself overpacking the Universal luggage and damning it for 
not being roomier. You'll walk 
into stores and in a fit of momentary amnesia about this conversation you'll buy Starrzelius, 
bless you." 

O'Shea laughed uncertainly. 
"And you did it with words?" 

"Words and pictures. Sight and 
sound and smell and taste and 
touch. And the greatest of these 
is words. Do you read poetry?" 

"My God, of course not! Who 
can?" 

"1 don't mean the contemporary stuff; you're quite right 
about that. I mean Keats. Swinburne — the great lyricists." 

"I used to, a little," he cautiously admitted. "What about 
it?" 

"I'm going to ask you to spend 
the morning and afternoon with 
one of the world's great poets: a 
girl named Tildy Mathis. She 
doesn't know she's a poet; she 
thinks she's a boss copywriter. 
Don't enlighten her. It might 
make her unhappy.

slow time, 

Sylvan historian — * 
That's the sort of thing she would 
have written before the rise of 
advertising. The correlation is 
perfectly clear. Advertising up, 
lyric poetry down. There are only 
so many people capable of putting together words that stir and 
move and sing. When it became 
possible to earn a very good living in advertising by exercising 
this capability, lyric poety was 
left to untalented screwballs who 
had to shriek for attention and 
compete by eccentricity." 

"You talk pretty damn funny 
yourself." 

"Words are my business, 
Jack." 

"Why are you telling me all 
this?" he wanted to know. 

"I said you're on the inside. 
There's a responsibility that goes 
with the power. In this profession, 
we reach into the souls of men 
end women. We do it by taking 
talent and — redirecting it. Nobody should play with lives the 
way we do unless he's, motivated 
by the highest ideals." 

"I get you," he said softly. 
"Don't worry about my motives. 
I*m not in this thing for money 
or fame. I'm in it so the human 
race can have some elbow room 
and dignity again." 

"That's it," I said, putting on 
Expression Number One. But inwardly I was startled. The "high


est ideal" I had been about to 
mention was Sales. 

I buzzed for Tildy. "Talk to 
her," I said. "Answer her questions. Ask her some. Make it a 
long, friendly chat. Make her 
share your experiences. And, 
without knowing it, she'll write 
lyric fragments of your experiences that will go right to the 
hearts and souls of the readers. 
Don't hold out on her." 

"Certainly not. Uh, Mitch, will 
she hold out on me?" His face 
was from a Tanagra figurine of 
11 hopeful young satyr. 

"That depends on you. I told 
you people are stirred by words. 
Women are people. Jack." 

But I wondered about Kathy. 
She hadn't stayed stirred. 

npHAT afternoon, for the first 
-* time in four months, Kathy 
called me. 

"Is anything wrong?" I asked 
worriedly. "Anything I can do?" 

She laughed. "Nothing wrong, 
Mitch. I just wanted to say hello 
and tell -you thanks for a lovely 
evening." 

"How about another one?" I 
promptly asked. 

"Dinner at my place tonight 
suit you?" 

"It certainly does. What color 
dress will you be wearing? I'm 
going to buy you a flower!" 

"Oh, Mitch, you needn't be 
that extravagant: we aren't court 



 



ing. But there is something I 
wish you'd bring." 

"Name it and it's yours." 

"Jack O'Shea. Can you manage it? I saw by the 'cast that 
he came into town this morning 
and I suppose he's working with 
you." 

Very dampened. I said : "Yes, 
be is. I'll check with him and call 
you back. Arc you over at the 
hospital?" 

"Yes. And thanks so much for 
trying. I'd love to meet him." 

I got in touch with O'Shea in 
Tildy's office. "You booked up 
for tonight?" I asked. 

"I don't seem to be," he said 
morosely. "My proposition didn't 
sell so good. What's yours?" 

"Quiet dinner at home with 
my wife and me. She happens to 
be beautiful and a good cook and 
a star class surgeon and excellent 
company." 

"You're on." 

So I called Kathy back and 
told her I'd bring the social lion 
about seven. 

He stalked into my office at 
six, grumbling: "I'd better get a 
good meal out of this, Mitch. 
Your Miss Mathis appeals to 
me. What a dope! Does she have 
sense enough to come in out of 
the smog?" 

"I don't believe so," I said. 
**But Keats was properly hooked 
by a designing wench, Byron 
didn't have sense enough to stay 



out of the V-D ward, and Swinburne made a tragic mess out of 
his life. Do I have to go on?" 

"No. What kind of marriage 
have you got?" 

"Interlocutory," I said, a little 
painfully. 

He raised his eyebrows a trifle. 
"My mother was an Kaster-duty 
Catholic," he said, "and I guess 
I'm a lapsed Catholic or worse. 
But still there's something about 
those arrangements that sets my 
teeth on edge." 

"Mine, too," I said, "at least 
where it involves me. In case 
Tildy missed telling you, my 
beautiful and talented wife does 
not want to finalize it, we don't 
live together, and unless I change 
her mind in four months, we'll 
be washed up." 

"Tildy did miss telling me," he 
said. "You're pretty sick about 
it, seems to me." 

I almost invited his sympathy. 
I almost started to tell him how 
rough it was, how much I loved 
her, how she wasn't giving me an 
even break, how I'd tried everything I could think of and nothing would convince her. And then 
I realized that I'd be telling it to 
a sixty-pound midget who, if he 
married, might become his wife's 
helpless plaything or butt of ridicule. 

"Middling sick," I said. "Let's 
go, Jack. Time for a drink and 
then the shut11 j ."

KATHY had never looked lovelier and I wished 1 hadn't let 
her talk me out of shooting a 
couple of days' pay on a flower 
from Tiffany's. 

She said hello to O'Shea and 
he announced loudly and immediately: "I like you. There's no 
gleam in your eye. No 'Isn't he 
cute?' gleam. No 'A girl's got a 
right to try anything once' gleam. 
No 'My, he must be rich and 
frustrated?' gleam. In short, you 
like me and I like you." 

As you may have gathered, he 
was a little drunk. 

"You are going to have some 
coffee, Mr. O'Shea," she said. "I 




 



rutned mysetf to provide real 
pork sausages and real apple 
sauce, and you're going to taste 
them.'* 

"Coffee?" he said. "Coffiest for 
me, ma'am. To drink coffee 
would be disloyal to the great 
firm of Fowler Schocken Associates, with which I am associated. Isn't that right, Mitch?" 

"I give indulgence this once," 
I said. "Besides, Kathy doesn't 
believe the harmless alkaloid in 
Coffiest is harmless.** 

Luckily, she was in the kitchen 
corner with her back turned when 
I said that, and cither missed it 
or could afford to pretend she 
did. We'd had a terrific four-hour 
battle over that very point, complete with epithets like "babypoisoner" and "crackpot -reformer" and a few others that 
were shorter and nastier. 

The coffee was served and 
quenched O'Shea's mild glow. 

Dinner was marvelous. The 
pork sausages turned out to be 
not patties, but crisp tittle cylinders; I'd never had them that 
way before and asked about 
them. 

"That's how they usually were 
made," Kathy explained. "The 
casing around the meat is organic, too. It's the small intestine 
of the hog." 

"Gah!" I said, astonished and 
disgusted. 

"Now, Mitch," she said evenly. 



"It tasted good. This nicy-nicy 
business about food isn't smart. 
Carry it to extremes and it becomes very foolish indeed. I hear 
that in India it's no use to ship 
rice into a Northern famine area 
or wheat into a Southern famine 
area. The people just won't eat 
it. They'll lie down on a sack of 
it and starve." 

"Interesting," O'Shea commented. "And it did taste good. 
If I may ask — where did you get 
it?" 

She smiled. "I'm afraid I 
couldn't give you the — supplier's 
name without his permission. I'm 
sure you understand." 

"Of course. Lord. I wish I'd 
lived in the old days! Don't you, 
Mitch?" 

"Not me,** I said promptly. 
"You can moon about the spacious four-room apartments, and 
about buying all the new meat 
you want at fifty dollars a pound. 
Things are a little more cramped 
now, but think of what we have 
in added convenience. In my 
trainee days we did some research 
for Stirrzelius depilatory and I 
was the goat. I had to shave, 
with a razor, for one whole week! 
Unless you've been through that 
yourself, you don't know what 
it's like. No, we're better off nowadays." 

Kathy mused : "Wouldn't the 
simplest way out be to grow a 
beard?"

I stared at her, decided she 
was joking, and laughed. "Surely, 
Kathy, you'll admit that medical 
progress means we're healthier 
now than we used to be?" 

She struck a cigarette and exhaled a long plume of smoke hefore she answered. 

"Who knows? The Black 
Plague came to an end in the 
Middle Ages without the discovery of penicillin. Medical historians are still arguing about the 
great influenza epidemic of 19171919. Some of them say it was 
e coal shortage — no, not even 
that, just a breakdown of coal 
distribution. Surgery? Well, 1 did 
the hysterectomy this morning 
end got all the metastases — 
maybe. We still don't know about 
mental illness. But we do have 
an immense variety of things to 
shoot into people when they complain that it hurts here. Mr. 
O'Shea, if you go around saying 
that Dr. Nevin was saying thusand-so about medical progress, 
I'll first deny it and second cut 
your throat." 

"Respectfully noted," O'Shea 
said. "To keep this seminar going, 
I state that I am an aeronautical 
engineer and a good one. I've 
been exposed to the history of 
aviation. You know how nerveracking a flight is — traffic pattern 
up, congested lanes, traffic pattern down. I can't point to any 
golden age when things were bet


ter, but I've sometimes thought 
the whole approach was wrong 
since Kittyhawk. The theme song 
has always been bigger and 
faster; bigger and faster. Why not 
smaller and smoother? Why not 
slower and pleasanter?" 

I found myself hotly defending 
things as they are: bigger because 
you can do more with them, 
faster because it means increased 
command of natuVe — in effect, 
lengthening your active life. 

"You can lengthen your active 
life in a manner of speaking with 
cerebri/!," O'Shea objected. 
"What's so good about that?" 

"That's not what I mean — ." 

"You've been to the Moon, I 
suppose?'' Kathy asked O'Shea. 

"Not yet. One of these clays." 

"There's nothing there," I said. 
"It's a waste of time. One of our 
dullest, deadest accounts. I suppose we only kept it for the experience we'd get, looking ahead 
to Venus. A few hundred people 
mining — that's the whole story." 

"Excuse me," O'Shea said, and 
retired. 

I grabbed the chance. "Kathy, 
darling," I said, "it was real fine 
of you to ask me over. Does it 
mean anything?" 

She rubbed her right thumb 
end index finger together and I 
knew that whatever she would 
say after that would be a lie. "It 
might, Mitch. You'll have to give 
me time."

T threw away my secret 
weapon. "You're lying," I an* swered disgustedly. "You always 
do this before you lie to me." I 
showed her, and she let out a 
short laugh. 

"Fair's fair," she said with bitter amusement. "You always 
catch your breath and look right 
into my eyes when you lie to 
me." 

O'Shea returned and felt the 
tension at once. "I ought to be 
going," he said. 

There were the usual politenesses at the door, and Kathy 
kissed me good night. It was a 
long, warm, clinging kiss; altogether the kind of kiss that should 
start the evening rather than end 
it. It set her own pulse going — I 
felt that — but she closed the door 
on us. 

"You been thinking about a 
bodyguard again?" O'Shea asked. 

I thought it was an inexcusable 
crack and started to say something unpleasant. His face was 
abstracted; he had missed the 
by-play or ignored it. 

"The shooting was a mistake,'* 
I stubbornly said. 

"Let's stop by your place for 
a drink," he suggested ingenuously. 

The situation was almost pathetic. Sixty-pound Jack O'Shea 
was guarding me! "Sure," I said. 
We got on the shuttle. 

He went into the room first 



and turned on the light, and 
nothing happened. While sipping 
a very weak whisky and soda, he 
drifted around the place checking window locks, hinges and the 
like. 

"This chair would look better 
over there," he said. Over there, 
of course, was out of the line of 
fire from the window. I moved it. 

"Take care of yourself, Mitch," 
he said when he left, "That lovely 
wife and your friends would miss 
you if anything happened." 

The only thing that happened 
was that I barked my shin setting up the bed, and that was 
happening all the time. Even 
Kathy, with a surgeon's neat, economical movements, bore the 
scars of life in a city apartment. 
You set up the bed at night, you 
took it down in the morning, you 
set up the table for breakfast, 
you took it down to get to the 
door. No wonder some shortsighted people sighed for the spacious old days. I thought, settling 
myself luxuriously for the night. 

V 

•TlHINGS were rolling within a 
week. With Runstc^d out of 
my hair and at work on the 
PregNot-A.I.G. hassel, I could 
really grip the reins. 

Tildy's girls and boys were putting out the copy — temperamental kids, sometimes doing a line

a day with anguish; sometimes 
rolling out page after page effortlessly, with shining eyes, as 
though possessed. She directed 
and edited their stuff and passed 
the best of the best to me: nineminute commercial scripts, pix 
cut-lines, articles for planting, 
news stories, page ads, whispering campaign cue-lines, endorsements, jokes, limericks and puns 
(clean and dirty) to float through 
the country. 

Visual was hot. The airbrush 
and camera people were having 
fun sculpturing a planet. It was 
the ultimate in "Before and 
After" advertising, and they were 
caught by the sense of history. 

Development kept pulling rabbits out of hats. Collier once explained to me when I hinted that 
he might be over-optimistic: "It's 
energy, Mr. Courtenay. The Sun 
pours all that energy into Venus 
in the form of heat and molecular 
bonds and fast particles. Here on 
Earth we don't have that level of 
available energy. We use windmills to tap the kinetic energy of 
the atmosphere. On Venus we'll 
just build an accumulator, put up 
a lightning rod and jump back. 
It's an entirely different /eve/." 

Market Research Industrial 
Anthropology was at work in 
San Diego sampling the Cal-Mex 
area, trying Tildy's copy, Visual's layouts and films and extrapolating and interpolating. I had 



a direct wire to the desk of Ham 
Harris, Runstead's vice, in San 
Diego. 

A typical day began with a 
Venus Section meeting: pep talks 
by me, reports of progress by all 
hands, critique and cross-department suggestions. Harris, on the 
wire, might advise Tildy that "serene atmosphere" wasn't going 
well as a cue phrase in his sampling and that she should submit 
a list of alternatives. Tildy might 
ask Collier whether it would be 
okay to say "topaz sands" in a 
planted article which would hint 
that Venus was crawling with 
uncut precious and semi-precious 
stones. Collier might tell Visual 
that they'd have to make the atmosphere redder in a "before" 
panorama. And I might tell Collier to lay off because it was permissible license. 

After adjournment, everybody 
would go into production and I'd 
spend my day breaking ties, coordinating, and interpreting my 
d irecti ves from a bo ve down to 
the operational level. Before close 
of day, we'd hold another meeting which I would keep to some 
specific topic, such as integration 
of Starrzelius products into the 
Venus economy, or income-level 
of prospective Venus colonists 
for optimum purchasing power 
twenty years after landing. 

And then came the best part of 
the day. Kathy and I were going 




 



steady again. We were still under 
separate cover, but I was buoyantly certain that it wouldn't be 
long now. Sometimes she dated 
me. sometimes I dated her. There 
wasn't much serious talk. She 
didn't encourage it and I didn't 
press it. I thought that time was 
on my side. Jack O'Shea made 
the rounds with us once before 
he had to leave for a lecture in 
Miami, and that made me feel 
good, too. A couple of welldressed, good-looking people who 
were so high up they could entertain the world's number one 
celebrity. 

After a week of solid, satisfying 
progress on the job, I told Kathy 
it was time for me to visit the 
outlying installations — the rocket 
site in Nevada and sampling 
headquarters in San Diego. 

"Fine," she said. "Can I go 
with you?" 

I was silly-happy about it; it 
wouldn't be long now. 

THE rocket visit was routine. 
I had a couple of people there 
as liaison with Armed Forces, 
Republic Aviation, Bell Telephone Labs and U. S. Steel. They 
showed Kathy and me through 
the monster ship, glib as tourist 
guides: "... vast steel shell 
, . . more cubage than the average 
New York office building . . . 
closed-cycle food and water and 
air regeneration . . . one-third 



drive, one-third freight, one-third 
living space - . . heroic pioneers 
. . - insulation . . . housekeeping 
power . . . sunside-darkside heat 
pumps . . . unprecedented industrial effort . . . national sacrifice 
. . . national security . . ." 

Oddly, the most impressive 
thing about it to me was not the 
rocket itself, but the wide area 
around it. For a full mile the 
land was cleared: no buildings, 
no greenhouse decks, no food 
tanks, no Sun traps. Partly security, partly radiation. The 
gleaming sand cut by irrigation 
pipes looked strange. There probably wasn't another sight like it 
in North America. It troubled my 
eyes. Not for years had I focused 
them more than a few yards in 
any direction except up. 

"How strange," Kathy said at 
my side. "Could we walk out 
there?" 

"Sorry. Dr. Nevin," said one 
of the liaison men. "It's our 
perimeter. The tower guards are 
ordered to shoot anybody out 
there." 

"Have contrary orders issued," 
I told him. "Dr. Nevin and I 
want to walk." 

"Of course, Mr. Courtenay,** 
the man said, very worried. "I'll 
do my best, but it'll take a little 
time. I'll have to clear it with 
C.I.C., Naval Intelligence, C.I.A., 
F.B.I., A.E.C., Security and Intelligence— * 



GRAVY PLANET 



I looked at Kathy and she 
shrugged with helpless amusement. 

"Never mind," I said. 

"Thank God!" breathed my liaison man. "It's never been done 
before, so there aren't any channels to do it through. You know 
what that means." 

"I do indeed. Tell me, has all 
the security paid off?" 

"There's been no sabotage or 
espionage, foreign or Connie, that 
we know of." He rapped a 
knuckle of his right hand solemnly on a genuine oak engagement ring he wore on the third 
finger of his left hand. I made a 
mental note to have his expense 
account checked up on. A man 
on his salary had no business 
wearing such expensive jewelry. 

"The Connies interested?" I 
asked. 

He shrugged. "Who knows?" 
Would you like to meet Commander MacDonald and find 
out? He's the O.N.I, chief here. A 
specialist in Connies." 

*'Like to meet a Connie specialist, Kathy?" I asked. 

"If we have time," she said. 

"I'll have them hold the jet for 
you if necessary," the liaison man 
offered eagerly, trying hard to 
undo his fiasco on the tower 
guards. He led us through the 
tangle of construction shacks and 
warehouses to the Administration 
Building and past seven security 



check points to the office of the 
commander. 

He was one of those career officers who make you feel good 
about being an American consumer — quiet, competent, strong. 
He wore the class insignia of 
the Pinkerton Graduate School 
of Detection and Military Intelligence, Inc. It's veneer pine 
with an open eye carved on it; 
no flashy inlay work. But it's like 
a brand name. It tells you that 
you're dealing with quality. 

"You want to hear about Connies?" he asked quietly. "I'm 
your man. I've devoted my life 
to running them down." 

"A personal grudge, Commander?" I asked, thinking we'd 
hear something melodramatic. 

"No. Old-fashioned pride of 
workmanship if anything. I like 
the thrill of the chase, too, but 
there isn't much chasing. You 
get Connies by laying traps. Did 
you hear about the Wichita 
bombing? Of-course-I-shouldn'tknock - the - competition - but — 
Wilson Detection bungled that 
one badly. They should have 
known it was a setup for a Connie demonstration." 

"Why, exactly, Commander?'* 
Kathy asked. 

He smiled wisely. "Feel. The 
Connies don't like hydraulic mining — ever. Give them a chance to 
pull some wrecking and they'll 
take it if they can." 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE F1CT1 O H 



"But why don't they like hydraulic mining?" she persisted. 
"We've got to have coal and iron, 
don't we?" 

"Now," he said with pretended, 
humorous weariness, "you're asking me to probe the mind of a 
Connie. I've had them questioned 
for up to six hours at a stretch 
and never yet have they talked 
sense. If I caught the Wichita 
Connie, he'd talk willingly — but 
it would be gibberish. He'd tell 
me the hydraulic miner was destroying top-soil. I'd say yes, 
what about it? He'd say the topsoil can never be replaced. I'd 
say yes, it ean, if it had to be 
and anyway tank farming's better. He'd say something like tank 
farming doesn't provide animal 
cover and so on. It always winds 
up with him telling me the 
world's going to hell and people 
have got to be made to realize it." 

Kathy laughed incredulously. 

"They're fools, but they're 
roug/i," the commander went on. 
"They have discipline. A cell 
system. If you get one Connie, 
you usually get the two or three 
others in his cell, but you hardly 
ever get any more. There's no 
lateral contact between cells, and 
vertical contact with higher-ups 
is by rendezvous with middlemen. And of course the picture 
is clouded by what you might call 
'small-c' connies: neurotic youngsters, mental cases, occasionally 



professional criminals who fake a 
Connie demonstration so they 
can loot." 

"I think we saw one of those 
neurotic youngsters," Kathy said. 
She described the incident in the 
bar that had loused up our < vening the week before. 

The commander nodded positively. "Small-c. They don't carry 
arms unless they're going to use 
them, and the smoking-anddrinking angle is just theontical 
to them. They say they know it's 
'anti-survival' — in their jargon — 
but they say the conditions that 
cause smoking and drinking must 
be corrected Hrst. Yes, I think I 
know them and that's why I'm 
not especially worried about sabotage or a demonstration here. 
It doesn't have the right ring to 
it." 

"You're very reassuring, Commander," Kathy smiled as we 
got up. "Thank you so much." 

At the door, MacDonald cautioned us: "We don't talk to just 
anybody about the small-c connies, as I called them. The public 
thinks every demonstration is by 
the true Connie organization 
which is good for our purposes, 
The worse they think of Connies 
and the more afraid of them they 
are, the closer they cooperate 
with Intelligence and Security. 
Understood?" 

"My lips are sealed, Commander. Thanks again."

KATHY and I lolled back, 
watching the commercials 
parade around the passenger 
compartment of the jet at eye 
level. There was the good old 
Kiddiebutt jingle I worked out 
when I was a cadet. I nudged 
Kathy and told her about it as 
it blinked and chimed at us. 

All the commercials went blank 
and a utility announcement came 
on: "In compliance with Federal 
law, passengers are advised that 
they are now passing over the 
San Andreas Fault into earthquake territory, and that earthquake loss and damage clauses 
in any insurance they may carry 
are now canceled and will remain 
canceled until passengers leave 
earthquake territory." Then the 
commercials resumed their parade. 

"And," said Kathy, "I suppose 
it says in the small print that 
yak-bite insurance is good anywhere except in Tibet." 

"Yak-bite insurance?" I asked, 
astonished. "What would anyone 
carry that for?" 

"A girl can never tell when 
she'll meet an unfriendly yak, can 
she?" 

"I conclude that you're kidding." I said with dignity. "We 
ought to land in a few minutes. 
Personally, I'd like to pop in on 
Ham Harris unexpectedly. He's 
a good kid, but Runstead may 
have infected him with defeatism. 



There's nothing wocnt in OUT

"I'll come along wild you if

our visit. There had been some

blame that on the old-style construction that fell hard and in 
jagged hunks. Eventually people 
got used to it and — as you'd expect in southern California — even 
proud of it. Natives could cite 
you reams of statistics to prove 
that you stood more chance of 
being struck by lightning or a 
meteorite than you did of getting 
killed in one of their quakes. 

We got a speedy three-man 
limousine to pedal us to the local 
branch of Fowler Schocken Associates. 

The receptionist gave me my 
first setback. She didn't recognize my face and she didn't 
r< cognize my name when I gave 
it to her. She said lazily: "I'll see 
if Mr. Harris is busy. Mr. Courtney." 

"Mr. Courtenay, young lady. 
And I'm Mr. Harris's boss." 

Kathy and I walked in on a 
scene of idleness and slackness 
that curled, my hair. 

Harris, with his coat off, was 
ploying cards with two young 
employees. Two more were gaping, glassy-eyed, before a hypnoteleset. Another man was lackadaisically punching a calculator, 
one-finger system. 

"Harris!" I thundered. 

Everybody except the two men 
in trance swiveled my way, open


mouthed. I walked to the hypnoteleset and snapped it off. The 
pair came to, groggily. 

"Mum - mum - Mister Courtenay," Harris stuttered. "We 
didn't expect — " 

"Obviously. Let's go into your 
office." 

Unobtrusively, Kathy followed 
us. 

"Harris," I said, "I'm disturbed, gravely disturbed, by the 
atmosphere here. But that can 
be corrected — " 

His phone rang and I picked 
it up. 

A voice said excitedly: "Ham? 
He's here. Make it snappy; he 
took a limousine." 

"Thanks." I hung up. "Your 
tipster at the airport," I told Harris. He went white. "Show me 
your tally sheets," I said. "Your 
interview forms. Your punchcard 
codes. Your masters. Your sigmaprogress charts. Everything, in 
short, that you wouldn't expect 
me to ask to see. Get them out." 

He stood there a long, long 
time and finally said : "There 
aren't any." 

"What have you got to show 
me?" 

"Finalizations," he muttered. 
"Composites." 

"Fakes, you mean? Fiction, 
like the stuff you've been feeding 
us over the wire?" 

He nodded. His face was sick. 

"How could you do it, Har* 



GRAVY PLANET 



SI 



ris?" I demanded. "How could 
you do it?" 

He poured out a confused torrent of words. He hadn't meant 
to.'*It was his first independent 
job. Maybe he was just no good 
and it was better this way. He'd 
tried to keep the lower personnel 
Up to snuff while he was dogging 
it himself, but it couldn't be 
done; they sensed it and took liberties and he didn't dare check 
them up. His self-pitying note 
changed; he became weakly belligerent. What difference did it 
make? It was just preliminary 
paperwork. One man's guess was 
as good as another's. And anyway the whole project might go 
down the drain. What if he had 
been taking it easy? He bet there 
were plenty of other people who 
took it easy and everything came 
out all right just the same. 

"No," I said. "You're wrong 
and you ought to know you're 
wrong. Advertising depends on 
the sciences of sampling, areatesting and customer research. 
You've knocked the props from 
under our program. We'll salvage 
what we can and start again." 

He took a feeble stand: "You're 
wasting your time if you do that, 
Mr. Courtenay. I've been working closely with Mr. Runstead 
for a long time. I know what he 
thinks, and he's as big a shot as 
you are. He thinks this paperwork is just a lot of nonsense," 



"What," I asked sharply, "have 
you got to .back that statement 
up with? Letters? Memos? Taped 
calls?" 

"I must have something like 
that," he said, and dived into his 
desk. He flipped through papers 
and played snatches of tape for 
minutes while the look of fear 
and frustration on his face deepened. At last he said in bewilderment: 

"I can't seem to find anything, _ 
but I'm sure — " 

Sure he was sure. The highest 
form of our art is to convince 
the customer without letting him 
know he's being convinced. This 
weak sister had been indoctrinated by Runstead with the unrealistic approach and then sent 
in on my project, to do a good 
job of crumming it up. 

"You're fired, Harris." I said, 
"I wouldn't advise you to try for 
a job in the advertising profession after this. It would be a 
waste of time." 

I went into the office and announced: "You're through. All of 
you. Collect your personal stuff 
and leave the office. You'll get 
your checks by mail." 

They gaped. Beside me, Kathy 
murmured : "Mitch, is that really 
necessary?" 

"You're damned right it's necessary. Did one of them tip off 
the home office on what was 
going on? No; they just relaxed 



It 




 



and drifted. I said it was an infection, didn't I? This is it." 

Ham Harris drifted past us 
toward the door, hurt bewilderment on his face. He had been so 
sure Runstead would back him 
up. He had his crammed briefcase in one hand and his raincoat 
in the other. He didn't look at 
me. 

I went into his vacated office 
and picked up the direct wire to 
New York. "Hester? This is Mr. 
Courtenay. I've just fired the entire San Diego branch. Notify 
Personnel and have them do 
whatever's necessary about pay. 
And get me Mr. Runstead on the 
line." 

I drummed my fingers impatiently for a long minute and then 
Hester said: "Mr. Courtenay, I'm 
sorry to keep you waiting. Mr. 
Runstead's secretary says he's 
left for Little America on one of 
those tours. She says he cleaned 
up the A.I.G. thing and felt like 
a rest." 

"Felt like a rest? Good God! 
Hester, get me a New York to 
Little America reservation. I'm 
shooting right back on the next 
jet. I want to just barely touch 
ground before I zip off to the 
Pole. Got it?" 

"Yes, Mr. Courtenay." 

I hung up and found that 
Kathy was staring at me, "You 
know, Mitch, I've been uncharitable to you in my time, kicking 



about your bad temper. I can see 
where you got it, if this is a typical situation." 

"It's not typical," I said. "It's 
the worst case of obstructionism 
I've ever seen. But there's a lot 
of it in our line — everybody trying to make everybody else look 
bad so they'll look better. Darling, I've got to get to the field 
now and bull my way onto the 
next Eastbound. Do you want 
to come, too?" 

She hesitated. "You won't mind 
if I stay and do a little tourist 
stuff by myself?" 

"No, of course not. You have 
a good time. When you get back 
to New York, I'll be there." 

We kissed and I raced out. 
The office was clear by then and 
I told the building, manager to 
lock it until further notice after 
Kathy left. 

I looked up from the street. 
She waved at me from the 
strange, flimsy building. 

VI 

I SWUNG off the ramp at New 
York; Hester was right there. 
"Good girl," I told her, "When 
does the Pole rocket shoot off? M 
"Twelve minutes, from Strip 
Six, Mr, Courtenay. Here are 
your ticket and the . reservation. 
And some lunch in case — " 

"Fine. I did miss a meal." We 
headed for Strip Six, with me

chewing a generated cheese sandwich as I walked. "What's up at 
the office?" 

"E13 excitement about you firing the San Diego people. Personnel sent up a complaint to 
Mr. Schocken and he upheld you 
—approximately Force Four." 

That wasn't so good. Force 
Twelve — hurricane — would have 
been a blast from his office on 
the order of : "How dare you 
question the decision of a Board 
man working on his own project? 
Never let me hear again — " And 
so on. Force Four — rising gale, 
small craft malic Tor harbor — was 
something like: "Gentlemen. I'm 
sure Mr. Court: nay had perfectly 
good reasons for doing what he 
did. Often the Big Picture is lost 
to the purely routine workers in 
our organization — " 

I asked Hester: "Is Runstead's 
secretary just a hired hand or one 
of his — " I was going to say 
"stooges, *' but smoothly reversed 
my field — "one of his confidants?" 

"She's pretty close to him." 
Hester said cautiously. 

"What was her reaction to the 
San Diego business?" 

"Somebody told me she laughed 
her head off. Mr. Courtcnay." 
I didn't push it any harder. Finding out where. I stood with respect 
to the big guns was legitimate. 
Asking about the help was asking 
her to rat on them. Not that there 



weren't girls who did. "I expect 
to be right back." I told Hester. 
"All I want to do is straighten 
out something with Runstcad." 

"Your wife won't be along?" 
she asked. 

"No. I'm going to tear Runstead into five or six pieces; if 
Dr. Nevin came along, she might 
try to put them back together 
again." 

Hester laughed politely and 
said: "Have a pleasant trip. Mr. 
Courtenay." We were at the ramp 
on Strip Six. 

TT was a miserable trip on a 
*- miserable, undersized tourist 
rocket. We flew low and there 
were prism windows at all seats, 
which never fail to make me airsick. You turn your head and 
look out and you're looking 
straight down. Worse, all the ads 
were Taunton Associates jobs. 
You look out the window and 
just as you convince your stomach that everything's all right 
and yourself that it's interesting 
country below, a sleazy, oversexed Taunton ad for some inferior product opaques the window and one of their nagging, 
stupid jingles drills shrilly into 
your ear. 

Over the Amazon Valley, for 
example, I was inspecting Electric Three, which happens to be 
the world's biggest power dam, 
when :

CALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Bolster Bra, Bolster Bra, 
Bolsters all the way; 
Don't you crumple, 
Don't you slumple; 
Keep them up to stay! 

The accompanying before-andafter live pix were in the worst 
possible taste, and I found myself thanking God again that I 
worked for Fowler Schocken Associates. 

It was the same off Tierra del 
Fuego. We left the great circle 
course 'for a look at the whale 
fisheries, vast sea areas inclosed 
by booms that let the plankton in 
and didn't let the whales out. I 
was watching with fascination as 
a cow whale nursed her calf — it 
looked something like an aerial 
refueling operation — when the 
window opaqued again for another dose of Taunton shock 
treatment: 

Sister, do you smell like this 
to your mister? The olfactory 
went on, and_ I had to use my 
carton while the ad chirped: No 
wonder he's hard to getf Use 
Swett! 

My seatmate, a nondescript 
customer m Universal apparel, 
watched sympathetically as I 
retched. "Too much for you, 
friend?" he asked, showing the 
maddening superiority people 
who suffer from motion-sickness 
know too well. 

**Uh, H I said. 



"Some of those ads are enough 
to make anybody sick." 

"Exactly what do you mean 
by that remark?" I asked evenly. 

It frightened him. "I only 
meant that it smelled a little 
strong," he said hastily. "Just 
that particular ad. I didn't mean 
ads in general. There's nothing 
wrong with me!" 

"Good for you," I said, and 
turned away. 

Still worried, he told me: "I'm 
perfectly sound, friend. I come 
from a good family. I went to a 
good school. I'm in the production end myself — die-maker in 
Philly — but I know the stuff's 
got to be sold. Channels of distribution. Building markets. Vertical integration. $ee? I'm perfectly sound J" 

"Okay," I grunted. "Then 
watch your mouth." 

He shriveled into his half of the 
seat. I hadn't enjoyed squelching 
him, but it was a matter of principle. A kid overhearing that kind 
of talk could be turned into a 
pushover for a slick Connie. 

WE were held up over Little 
America while a couple of 
other tourist craft touched down. 
One of them was from India and 
I mellowed at the sight. That 
ship, from nose to tail, was Indiastry-built. The crewmen were 
Indiastry-trained and Indiastryemployed. The passengers, wak


GRAVY PLANIT 



ing and sleeping, paid tribute 
minute by minute to Indiastry. 
And Indiastry paid tribute to 
Fowler Schocken Associates. 

A tow truck hauled us into 
the great double-walled plastic 
doughnut that is Little America. 
There was only one check point. 
Little America is an invisible export — a dollar trap for the tourists of the world, with no 
military value. (There are Polar 
military bases, but they are small, 
scattered and far under the ice, 
run by Columbia Field Forces, 
Inc.) A small thorium reactor 
heats and powers the place. Even 
if some nation desperate for fissionable material were to try to 
get it, it wouldn't have anything 
worth fighting for. Windmills eke 
out the thorium reactor, and 
there's some "heat pump" arrangement that I don't underst ind which ekes out the windmills. 

At the check point I asked 
about Runstead. The officer 
looked him up and said: "He's 
on the two-day tour out of New 
York. Thomas Cook and Son. His 
quarters are III-C-2205." He 
pulled out a map of the place 
and showed me that this meant 
third ring in. third floor up. fifth 
sector, twenty-second room. "You 
can't miss it. I can accommodate 
you with a nearby room, Mr. 
Courtenay — " 

"Thanks. Later." I shoved oFf 



and elbowed my way through 

crowds chattering in a dozen 
languages to III-C-2205 and rang 
the bell. No answer. 

A pleasant young man said to 
me: "I'm the tour director. Can 
I help you?" 

"Where's Mr. Runstead? I 
want to see him on business." 

"Dear me. We try to get away 
from all that. I'll look in my 
register if you'll just wait a moment." 

He took me to his office-bedroom-bath up the sector a way 
and pawed through a register. 
"The Starrzelius Glacier climb* 
he said. "He went alone. Left at 
0700, checked out in electric suit 
with R.D.F. and rations. He 
should be back in five hours or 
so. Have you arranged for quarters yet, Mr. — ?" 

"Not yet. I want to go after 
Runstead. It's urgent." And it 
was. I was going to burst a blood 
vessel if I didn't get my hands 
on him. 

The slightly fluttery tour director spent five minutes convincing me that the best thing to 
do was sign on for his tour and 
he'd arrange everything. Otherwise I'd be shifted from pillar to 
post buying and renting necessary equipment from concessionaires and then, like as not, be 
turned back at checkout and not 
able to find the concessionaires 
again while my vacation was

ticking away. I signed on and he 
beamed. He gave me a room in 
the sector — plenty of luxury. It 
would have been, ten by fourteen 
if it hadn't been slightly wedgeshaped. 

In five minutes he was dealing 
out equipment to me. "Power 
pack — strap it on so. That's the 
only thing that can go wrong; if 
you have a power failure, take a 
sleepy pill and don't worry. 
You'll freeze, but we'll pick you 
up before there's tissue damage. 
Boots. Plug them in so. Gloves. 
Plug them in. Coveralls. Hood. 
Snowglasses. Radio direction 
finder. Just tell the checkout 
guard, 'Starrzelius Glacier,' and 
he'll set it. Two simple switches 
plainly labeled 'out* and 'in.* Outward bound, it goes 'beep-beep* 
— ascending. I nward bound, it 
goes 'beep -beep' — descending. 
Just remember, going up the glacier, the tone goes up. Going 
down the glacier, the tone goes 
down. 

"Distress signal — a big red 
handle. You just pull and immediately you start broadcasting. 
The planes will be out in fifteen 
minutes. You have to pay the 
expenses for the search and rescue, so I wouldn't yank the handle just for a ride back. It's 
always possible to rest, have a 
sip of Coffiest and keep on going. 
Route-marked map. Snowshoes. 
Gyro-compass. Rations. Mr. 



Courtenay, you are equipped. I'll 
lead you to checkout." 

The outfit wasn't as bad as it 
sounded. I've been more heavily 
bundled up against the lakeside 
winds in a Chicago winter. The 
lumpy items, like the power pack, 
the R.D.F. and the rations, were 
well distributed. The snowshoes 
folded into a pair of staffs with 
steel points for ice climbing, and 
went into something like an 
archery quiver on my back. 

We passed public rooms on the 
way to checkout. A lot of drinking and petting seemed to be 
going on. The tour director 
sighed: "It's nice to have some 
of my people going out after they 
get here. Most of them — " He 
gestured. "And I have to be deaf, 
dumb and blind about who winds 
up in whose room. It's so discouraging at times!" 

Checkout was very thorough. 
They started with my heart and 
worked through my equipment 
with particular emphasis on the 
power pack. I passed, and they 
set the R.D.F. for Starrzelius 
Glacier, with sharp warnings not 
to overdo it. 

It wasn't cold inside the suit. 
For a moment only, I opened the 
face flap. Wham! I closed it 
again. Forty below, they had told 
me — a meaningless figure until 
my nose felt it for a split-second. 
I didn't need the snowshoes at 
the base of the towering plastic

doughnut; it was crust ice that 
my spike-soled shoes bit into. I 
oriented the map with the little 
gyro-compass and trudged off 
into the vast whiteness along with 
the proper bearing. From time to 
time I pressed my left sleeve, 
squeezing the molded R.D.F. 
switch and heard inside my hood 
a cheerful, reassuring "Beep-beep. 
Beep-beep. Beep-beep." 

There were some people frolicking in one party I passed and 
waved cheerily at. They seemed 
to be Chinese or Indians. What 
an adventure it must be for them! 
But, like poor swimmers hugging 
a raft, they did their frolicking

almost under the shadow of Little 
America. Farther out, there were 
some people playing a game I 
didn't know. They had posts with 
bottomless baskets set up at 
either end of a marked-off rectangular field; the object was to 
toss a large silicone ball through 
the baskets. Still farther out, 
there, was a skiing class with instructors in red suits. 

I looked back after trudging 
for what seemed only a few minutes and couldn't see the red suits 
or Little America any more — just 
a gray-white shadow. "Beepbeep," my R.D.F. said, and I 
kept going. Runstead was going 
to hear from me. Soon. 



The aloneness was eerie, but 
not unpleasant. Gradually, I 
began to realize why Fowler 
Schbcken had unerringly "picked 
. me to head the Venus Section. 
That remarkable man had 
known, somehow, that I was the 
kind of guy who could stand and 
maybe even enjoy the Antarctic 
; — or another planet. 

Was this how Jack O'Shea had 
felt? Was this why he fumbled 
for words to describe Venus and 
was never satisfied with the words 
he found? 

My feet plunged into a drift 
and I unshipped and opened the 
snowshoes. After a little stumbling experiment, I began an 
easy, sliding shuffle that was a 
remarkably pleasant way of covering ground. It wasn't floating, 
yet neither was it the solid jar 
of a shoe against a paved surface. We'd been selling people 
the notion that they were basically pioneers, and here I was buying the notion myself — and finding pride in it! 

T marched the compass course 
* by picking landmarks and 
going to them: an oddly curved 
ice hummock, a blue shadow on 
a swale of snow, a puffball cloud 
hanging low. The R.D.F. continued to confirm me. I was elated 
at my mastery of the wild, and 
after two hours I became wildly 
hungry with an urgency I'd never 



GRAVY PLANET

known before in my life. 

I had to squat and open a 
siliconc-tissue bell into which I 
fitted. Exposing my no^e cautiously fi'om time to time, 1 
judged the air warm enough in 
five minutes. I ravenously gulped 
the self-heated stew and tea and 
tried to strike a cigarette. It lit, 
but on the second puff I was 
blinded with smoke. Regretfully, 
I put it out against my shoe, 
closed my face mask, stowed the 
little tent and stretched happily. 

After another bearing, I started 
off again. I told myself: "This 
Runstead thing is just a difference of temperament. He can't 
see the wide-open spaces and you 
can. There's no malice involved, 
lie just thinks it's a crackpot 
idea because he doesn't realize 
that there are people who go for 
it. All you've got to do is explain 
it — " 

That argument, born of wellbeing, crumbled at one touch of 
reason. Runstead was out on the 
glacier, too. He most certainly 
could see the wide-open spaces if, 
of all the places on Earth he 
could be, he chose the Starrzelius 
Olacier. Well, a showdown was 
Hfad ahead. "Beep-beep." 

I sighted through the compass 
»nd picked a black object on my 
course. I couldn't quite make it 
out, but it was visible and it 
wasn't moving. I broke into a 
shuffling run that made me pant, 



and against my will I slowed 
down. It was a man. 

When I was twenty yards 
away, the man looked impatiently Fit his watch, and I broke into 
the clumsy run again. 

"Matt!" I yelled. "Matt Runstead !" 

"That's right, Mitch," he said, 
as nasty as ever. He had folded 
skis thrust into the snow beside 
him. "You're sharp today." 

"What's — what's — " I panted. 

"I have time to spare," he . 
said, "but you've wasted enough 
of it. Good-by, Mitch." Whije I 
stood there, helpless with exhaustion, he picked up his folded skis, 
swung them. I fell back with 
pain, bewilderment and shamed 
rage bursting my head. I felt him 
fumbling at my chest and then I 
didn't feel anything for a while. 

I woke thinking I had kicked 
the covers off and that it was 
cold for early autumn. Then the 
ice-blue Antarctic sky knifed into 
my eyes and I felt the crumbly 
snow beneath me. It had happened, then. My head ached horribly and I was ceild. Too cold. 
I felt and found that the power 
pack was missing. No heat to 
the suit, gloves and boots. Ml 
power to the R.D.F., coming or 
going. No use to pull the emergency signal. 

I tottered to my feet and felt 
the cold grip mc like a vise. There 
were footprints punched into the

snow leading — where? There was 
the trail of my snowshoes. Stiffly 
I took a step back along that 
trail, and then another, and then 
another. 

The rations. I could thrust 
them into the suit, break the 
heat seals and let them fill the 
suit with temporary warmth. 

Plodding step by step, I debated: "Stop and rest while you 
drink the ration's heat or keep 
moving? You need a rest. Something impossible happened. Your 
head is aching. You'll feel better 
if you sit for a moment, open a 
ration or two and then go on." 

I didn't sit. I knew what that 
would mean. I fumbled a Coffiest 
can from its pocket with ringers 



that would barely obey me, and 
got it into my suit. My thumb 
didn't seem strong enough to pop 
the seal and I told myself: "Sit 
down for a moment and gather 
your strength. You don't have to 
lie down." But I wanted to. 

My thumb drove through the 
seal and the tingling heat was 
painful. 

It became a blur. I opened cans 
until I couldn't work them out of 
their pockets any more. And then 
I sat down, telling myself I'd get 
up in one more second for Kathy, 
two more seconds for K a thy, 
three more seconds for Kathy. 

But I didn't.

First one up this tallest summit in the Solar 
System was a rotten egg ... a very rotten egg! 

Illustrated by BOB HAYES 



BRUCE heard their feet on 
the gravel outside and 
got up reluctantly to 
open the door for them. He'd 
been reading some of Byron's 
poems he'd sneaked aboard the 
ship; after that he had been on 
the point of dozing off, and now 
one of those strangely realistic 
dreams would have to be postponed for a while. Funny, those 
dreams. There were faces in them 
of human beings, or of ghosts, 



and other forms that weren't human at all, but seemed real and 
alive — except that they were also 
just parts of a last unconscious 
desire to escape death. Maybe 
that was it. 

" 'Oh that my young life were 
a lasting dream, my spirit not 
awakening till the beam of an 
eternity should bring the morrow," Bruce said. He smiled 
without feeling much of anything 
and added, "Thanks, Mr. Poe." 




 



Jacobs and Anhauser stood outside. The icy wind cut through 
and into Bruce, but he didn't 
seem to notice. Anhauser's bulk 
loomed even larger in the special 
cold-resisting suiting. Jacobs' 
thin face frowned slyly at Bruce. 

"Come on in, boys, and get 
warm," Bruce invited. 

"Hey, poet, you're still here!" 
Anhauser said, looking astonished. 

"We thought you'd be running 
off somewhere," Jacobs said. 

Bruce reached for the suit on 
its hook, started climbing into it. 
"Where?" he asked. "Mars looks 
alike wherever you go. Where did 
you think I'd be running to?" 

"Any place just so it was away 
from here and us," Anhauser said. 

"I don't have to do that. You 
are going away from me. That 
takes care of that, doesn't it?" 

"Ah, come on, get the hell out 
of there," Jacobs said. He pulled 
the revolver from its holster and 
pointed it at Bruce. "We got to 
get some sleep. We're starting up 
that mountain at five in the morning." 

"I know," Bruce said. "I'll be 
glad to see you climb the mountain." 

Outside, in the weird light of 
the double moons, Bruce looked 
up at the gigantic overhang of the 
mountain. It was unbelievable. 
The mountain didn't seem to 
belong here. He'd thought so when 



they'd first hit Mars eight months 
back and discovered the other 
four rockets that had never got 
back to Earth — all lying side by 
side under the mountain's shadow, 
like little white chalk marks on 
a tallyboard. 

They'd estimated its height 
at over 45,000 feet, which was 
a lot higher than any mountain 
on Earth. Yet Mars was much 
older, geologically. The entire 
face of the planet was smoothed 
into soft, undulating red hills by 
erosion. And there in the middle 
of barren nothingness rose that 
one incredible mountain. On certain nights when the stars were 
right, it had seemed to Bruce as 
though it were pointing an accusing finger at Earth — or a 
warning one. 

WITH Jacobs and Anhauser 
and the remainder of the 
crew of the ship, Mars V, seven 
judges sat in a semi -circle and 
Bruce stood there in front of 
them for the inquest. 

In the middle of the half-moon 
of inquisition, with his long legs 
stretched out and his hands 
folded on his belly, sat Captain 
Terrence. His uniform was black. 
On his arm was the silver fist 
insignia of the Conqueror Corps. 
Marsha Rennels sat on the extreme right and now there was 
no emotion at all on her trim, 
neat face. 



THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN 



AS 



He remembered her as she had 
been years ago, but at the moment he wasn't looking very hard 
to see anything on her face. It 
was too late. They had gotten 
her young and it was too late. 

Terrence's big, square face 
frowned a little. Bruce was aware 
suddenly of the sound of the 
bltak. never-ending wind against 
the plastilcne shelter. He remembered the strange misty shapes 
that had come to him in his 
dreams, the voices that had called 
to him, and how disappointed he 
had been when he woke from 
them, 

"This is a mere formality,'* 
Terrence finally said, "since we 
all know you killed Lieutenant 
Doran a few hours ago. Marsha 
saw you kill him. Whatever you 
say goes on the record, of course." 

"For whom?" Bruce asked. 

"What kind of question is that? 
For the authorities on Earth when 
we get back." 

"When you get back? Like the 
crews of those other four ships 
out there?" Bruce laughed without much humor. 

Terrence rubbed a palm across 
his lips, dropped the hand quickly 
again to his belly. "You want to 
make a statement or not? You 
shot Doran in the head with a 
rifle. No provocation for the attack. You've wasted enough of 
my time with your damn arguments and anti-social behavior. 



This is a democratic group. Everyone has his say. But you've 
said too much, and done too 
much. Freedom doesn't allow you 
to go around killing fellow crewmembers!'* 

"Any idea that there was any 
democracy or freedom left died 
on Venus," Bruce said. 

"Now we get another lecture!" 
Terrence exploded. He leaned 
forward. "You're sick, Bruce. 
They did a bad psych job on 
you. They should never have sent 
you on this trip. We need 
strength, all the strength we can 
find. You don't belong here." 

"I know," Bruce agreed indifferently. "I was drafted for this 
trip. I told them I shouldn't be 
brought along. I said I didn't 
want any part of it." 

"Because you're afraid. You're 
not Conqueror material. That's 
why you backed down when we 
all voted to climb the mountain. 
And what the devil does . 
Venus — ?" 

Max Drexcl's freckles slipped 
into the creases across his high 
forehead. "Haven't you heard him 
expounding on the injustice done 
to the Venusian aborigines. Captain? If you haven't, you aren't 
thoroughly educated to the crackpot idealism still infecting certain people." 

"I haven't heard it," Terrence 
admitted. "What injustice?" 

Bruce said, "I guess it couldn't 



64 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



really be considered an injustice 
any longer. Values have changed 
too much. Doran and I were part 
of the crew of that first ship to 
hit Venus, five years ago. Remember? One of the New Era's 
more infamous dates. Drexel says 
the Venusians were aborigines. 
No one ever got a chance to find 
out. We ran into this village. 
No one knows how old it was. 
There were intelligent beings 
there. One community left on the 
whole planet, maybe a few thousand inhabitants. They made 
their last mistake when they came 
out to greet us. Without even an 
attempt at communication, they 
were wiped out. The village was 
burned and everything alive in 
it was destroyed." 

Bruce felt the old weakness 
coming into his knees, the sweat 
beginning to run down his face. 
He took a deep breath and stood 
there before the cold nihilistic 
stares of fourteen eyes. 

"No," Bruce said. "I apologize. 
None of you know what I'm talking about." 

Terrence nodded. "You're 
psycho. It's as simple as that. 
They pick the most capable for 
these conquests. Even the flights 
are processes of elimination. 
Eventually we get the very best, 
the most resilient, the real conquering blood. You just don't 
pass, Bruce. Listen, what do you 
think gives you the right to stand 



here in judgment against the 
laws of the whole Solar System?" 

"There are plenty on Earth 
who agree with me," Bruce said. 
"I can say what I think now because you can't do more than 
kill me and you'll do that regardless ..." 

He stopped. This was ridiculous, a waste of his time. And 
theirs. They had established a 
kind of final totalitarianism since 
the New Era. The psychologists, 
the Pavlovian Reflex boys, had 
done that. If you didn't want to 
be reconditioned to fit into the 
social machine like a human 
vacuum tube, you kept your 
mouth shut. And for many, when 
the mouth was kept shut long 
enough, the mind pretty well forgot what it had wanted to open 
the mouth for in the first place. 

A minority in both segments of 
a world split into two factions. 
Both had been warring diplomatically and sometimes physically, 
for centuries, clung to old ideas 
of freedom, democracy, , selfdeterminism, individualism. To 
most, the words had no meaning 
now. It was a question of which 
set of conquering heroes could 
conquer the most space first. So 
far, only Venus had fallen. They 
had done a good, thorough job 
there. Four ships had come to 
Mars and their crews had disappeared. This was the fifth attempt — 



THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN

IERRENCE said, "why did 
you shoot Doran?" 



"I didn't like him enough to 
take the nonsense he was handing me, and when he shot the — * 
Bruce hesitated. 

"What? When he shot what:-'" 

Bruce felt an odd tingling in 
his stomach. The wind's voice 
seemed to sharpen and rise to 
a kind of wail. 

"All right, I'll tell you. I was 
sleeping, having a dream. Doran 
woke me up. Marsha was with 
him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we were supposed to 
be working on. I've had these 
dreams ever since we got here." 

"What kind of dreams?" 

Someone laughed. 

"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your 
Pavlovian there," Bruce said. 
"People talk to me, and there are 
other things in the dreams. Voices 
and some kind of shapes that 
aren't what you would call human at all." 

Someone coughed. There was 
obvious embarrassment in the 
room. 

"It's peculiar, but many faces 
and voices are those of crew members of some of the ships out 
there, the ones that never got 
back to Earth." 

Terrence grinned. "Ghosts, 
Bruce?" 

"Maybe. This planet may not 
be a dead b-sll of clay. I've had 
A feeling there's something real 



in the dreams, but I can't figure 
it out. You're still interested?" 

Terrence nodded and glanced 
to either side. 

"We've seen no indication of 
any kind of life whatsoever," 
Bruce pointed out. "Not even an 
insect, or any kind of plant life 
except some fungi and lichen 
down in the crevices. That never 
seemed logical to me from the 
start. We've covered the planet 
everywhere except one place — " 

"The mountain," Terrence said. 
"You've been afraid even to talk 
about scaling it." 

"Not afraid," Bruce objected. 
"I don't sec any need to climb it. 
Coming to Mars, conquering 
space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew of the first 
ship here decided to climb the 
mountain, and that set a precedent. Every ship that has come 
here lias had to climb it. Why? 
Because they had to accept the 
challenge, And what's happened 
to them? Like you, they all had 
the necessary equipment to make 
a successful climb, but no one's 
ever come back down. No contact with anything up there. 

"Captain, I'm not accepting a 
ridiculous challenge like that. 
Why should I? I didn't come here 
to conquer anything, even a 
mountain. The challenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where 
ever you guys intend going before something bigger than you 




 



arc stops you — it doesn't interest 
me." 

"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth I" Terrence said, 
sitting up straight and rigid. 

"I know," Bruce said. "Anyway. I got off the track. As I 
was saying, I woke up from this 
dream and Marsha and Doran 
were there. Doran was shaking 
me. But I didn't seem to have 
gotten entirely awake; either that 
or some part of the dream was 
real, because I looked out the 
window — something was out 
there, looking at me. It was late, 
and at first I thought it might 
be a shadow. But it wasn't. It 
was misty, almost translucent, 
but I think it was something alive. 
I bad a feeling it was intelligent, 
maybe very intelligent. I could 
feel something in my mind. A 
kind of beauty and softness and 
warmth. I kept looking — " 

His throat was getting tight. He 
had difficulty talking. "Doran 
asked me what I was looking at, 
and I told him. He laughed. But 
he looked. Then I realized that 
maybe I wasn't still dreaming. 
Doran saw it, too, or thought he 
did. He kept looking and finally 
he jumped and grabbed up his 
rifle and ran outside. I yelled 
at him. I kept on yelling and ran 
after him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do 
you know it means any harm?' 
But I heard Doran's rifle go off 



before I could get to him. And 
whatever it was we saw, I didn't 
see it any more. Neither did 
Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't 
know. He had to kill it. That's 
the way you think." 

"What? Explain that remark." 

"That's the philosophy of conquest — don't take any chances 
with aliens. They might hinder 
our advance across the Universe. 
So we kill everything. Doran 
acted without thinking at all. 
Conditioned to kill everything 
that doesn't look like us. So I 
hit Doran and took the gun away 
from him and killed him. I felt 
sick, crazy with rage. Maybe 
that's part of it. Ail I know is 
that I thought he deserved to die 
and that I had to kill him, so I 
did." 

"Is that all, Bruce?" 

"That's about all. Except that 
I'd like to kill all of you. And 
I would if I had the chance." 

"That's what I figured." Terrence turned to the psychologist, 
a small wiry man who sat there 
constantly fingering his ear. 
"Stromberg, what "do you think 
of this gobbledegook? We know 
he's crazy. But what hit him? 
You said his record was good up 
until a year ago." 

Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape. 
"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia is caused by inner con

flict — Indecision between the older 
values and our present ones which 
he hasn't been able to accept. A 
complete case history would tell 
why he can't accept our present 
attitudes. I would say that he 
has an incipient fear of personal 
inadequacy, which is why he fears 
our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense 
which he's structured with his 
idealism, foundationed with Old 
Era values. Retreat into the past, 
an escape from his own present 
feelings of inadequacy. Also, he 
escapes into these dream fantasies." 

"Yes," Terrence said. "But 
how does that account for Doran's 
action ? Doran must have seen 
something — " 

"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another 
weak personality eliminated. Let's 
regard it that way. He imagined 
he saw something." He glanced 
at Marsha. "Did you see anything?" 

She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's 
eyes. •Nothing at all. There 
wasn't anything out there to see, 
except the dust and rocks. That's 
all there is to see here. We could 
stay a million years and never 
see anything else. A shadow 
maybe — " 

"AH right," Terrence interrupted. "Now, Bruce, you know 
the law rcgulnting the treatment 
of serious psycho cases in space?" 



*'Yes. Execution.** 

"No facilities for handling such 
cases en route back to Earth." 

"I understand. No apologies 
necessary, Captain." 

Terrence shifted his position. 
"However, we've voted to grant 
you a kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service 
from you, you can remain here 
on Mars after we leave. Youll 
be left food -concent rates to last 
a long time." 

"What kind of service?" 

"Stay by the radio and take 
down what we report as we go 
up the mountain." 

i'Why not?" Bruce said. "You 
aren't certain you're coming back, 
then?" 

"We might not," Terrence admitted calmly. "Something's happened to the others. We're going 
to find out what and we want it 
recorded. None of us want to 
back down and stay here. You 
can take our reports as they 
come in." 

"I'll do that," Bruce said. "It 
should be interesting." 

TJRUCE watched them go, away 
and up and around the immediate face of the mountain in 
the bleak cold of the Martian 
morning. He watched them disappear behind a high ledge, tied 
together with plastic rope like 
convicts. 

He stayed by the radio. He lost 




 



track of time and didn't care 
much if he did. Sometimes he 
took a heavy sedative and slept. 
The sedative prevented the 
dreams. He had an idea that the 
dreams might be so pleasant that 
he wouldn't wake up. He wanted 
to listen to Terrence as long as 
the captain had anything to say. 
It was nothing but curiosity. 

At fifteen thousand feet, Terrence reported only that they 
were climbing. 

At twenty thousand feet, Terrence said, "We're still climbing, 
and that's all I can report, Bruce. 
It's worth coming to Mars for — 
to accept a challenge like this!" 

At twenty-five thousand feet, 
Terrence reported, "We've put 
on oxygen masks. Jacobs and 
Drexel have developed some kind 
of altitude sickness and we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I can imagine plenty of tourists coming to 
Mars one of these days, just to 
climb this mountain! Mt. Everest 
is a pimple compared with this! 
What a feeling of power, Bruce!** 

From forty thousand feet, Terrencesaid, "We gauged this mountain at forty -five thousand. But 
here we are at forty and there 
doesn't seem to be any top. We 
can see up and up and the mountain keeps on going. I don't understand how we could have made 
such an error in our computations. I talked with Burton. He 



doesn't see how a mountain this 
high could still be here when the 
rest of the planet has been worn 
so smooth." 

And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with 
a voice that seemed slightly 
strained : "No sign of any of the 
crew of the other four ships yet. 
Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. 
Not a sign of any of them so 
far, but then we seem to have a 
long way left to climfci — " 

Bruce listened and noted and 
took sedatives and opened cans 
of food concentrates. He smoked 
and ate and slept. He had plenty 
of time. He had only time and 
the dreams which he knew he 
could utilize later to take care 
of the time. 

From sixty thousand feet. Terrence reported, "I had to shoot 
Anhauser a few minutes ago! He 
was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? 
One of my most dependable men. 
We took a vote. A mere formality, 
of course, whether we should continue climbing or not. We knew 
we'd all vote to keep on climbing. 
And then Anhauser dissented. He 
was hysterical. He refused to accept the majority decision. 'I'm 
going back down!' he yelled. So 
I had to shoot him. Imagine a 
man of his apparent caPjer 
turning anti-democratic like t':at! 
This mountain will be a £»/cat 
tester for us in the future. flVfl

who the weaklings are." 

Bruce listened to the wind. It 
seemed to rise higher and higher. 
Terrence, who had climbed still 
higher, was calling. "Think of it! 
What a conquest! No man's ever 
done a thing like this. Like 
Stromberg says, it's symbolic! We 
can build spaceships and reach 
other planets, but that's not actual physical conquest. We feel 
like gods up here. We can see 
what we are now. We can see 
how it's going to be — " 

Once in a while Terrence demanded that Bruce say something 
to prove he was still there taking 
down what Terrence said. Bruce 
obliged. A long time passed, the 
way time does when no one cares. 
Bruce stopped taking the sedatives finally. The dreams came 
back and became, somehow, more 
real each time. He needed the 
companionship of the dreams. 

It was very lonely sitting there 
without the dreams, with nothing 
but Terrence's voice ranting excitedly on and on. Terrence didn't 
seem real any more; certainly not 
as real as the dreams. 

problem of where to put 
the line between dream and 
reality began to worry Bruce. He 
would wake up and listen and 
take down what Terrence was 
saying, and then go to sleep again 
with increasing expectancy. His 
dream took on continuity. He 



could return to the point where 
he had left it, and it was the 
same — allowing even for the time 
difference necessitated by his periods of sleep. 

He met people in the dreams, 
two girls and a man. They had 
names: Pietro, Marlene, Helene. 

Helene he had seen from the 
beginning, but she became more 
real to him all the time, until he 
could talk with her. After that, 
he could also talk with Marlene 
and Pietro, and the conversations 
made sense. Consistently, they 
made sense. 

The Martian landscape was entirely different in the dreams. 
Green valleys and rivers, or actually wide canals, with odd trees 
trailing their branches on the 
slow, peacefully gliding currents. 
Here and there were pastel-colored 
cities and there were things drifting through them that were alive 
and intelligent and soft and warm 
and wonderful to know. 

' . . . dreams, in their vivid 
coloring of life*, as in that fleeting, 
shadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings 
to the delirious eye more lovely 
things of paradise and love — and 
all our own! — than young Hope 
in his sunniest hour hath known 

So sometimes he read poetry, 
but even that was hardly equal 
to the dreams. 

And then he v/ould wake up 




 



and listen to Terrence's voice. He 
would look out the window over 
the barren frigid land where there 
was nothing but seams of worn 
land, like scabs under the brazen 
sky. 

"If I had a choice," he thought, 
"I wouldn't ever wake up at all 
again. The dreams may not be 
more real, but they're preferable." 

Dreams were supposed to be 
wishful thinking, primarily, but 
he couldn't live in them very 
long. His body would dry up 
and he would die. He had to stay 
awake enough to put a little energy back into himself. Of course, 
if he died and lost the dreams, 
there would'be one compensation 
— he would also be free jof Terrence and the rest of them who 
had learned that the only value 
in life lay in killing one's way 
across the Cosmos. 

But then he had a feeling Terrence's voice wouldn't be annoying him much more anyway. The 
voice was unreal, coming out of 
some void. He could switch off 
Terrence any time now, but he 
was still curious. 

"Bruce— Bruce, you still there? 
Listen, we're up here at what we 
figure to be five hundred thousand feet! It iS impossible. We 
keep climbing and now we look 
up and we can see up and up 
and there the mountain is going 
up and up — " 

And some time later: "Bruce, 

THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN 



Marsha's dying! We don't know 
what's the matter. We can't find 
any reason for it. She's lying here 
and she keeps laughing and calling your name. She's a woman, 
so that's probably it. Women 
don't have real guts." 

Bruce bent toward the radio. 
Outside the shelter, the wind 
whistled softly at the door. 

"Marsha," he said. 

"Bruce — " 

She hadn't said his name that 
way for a long time. 

"Marsha, remember how we 
used to talk about human values? 
I remember how you seemed to 
have something maybe different 
from the others. I never thought 
you'd really buy this will to 
conquer, and now it doesn't 
matter ..." 

He listened to her voice, first 
the crazy laughter, and then a 
whisper. "Bruce, hello down 
there." Her voice was all mixed 
up with fear and hysteria and 
mockery. "Bruce darling, are you 
lonely down there? I wish I were 
with you, safe . . . free . . . warm. 
1 love you. Do you hear that? I 
really love you, after all. After 
all . . . M 

Her voice drifted away, c. < 
back to him. "We're climb^'-' t e 
highest mountain. What are yna 
doing there, relating where it's 
peaceful and warm and sane? 
You always were such a calm 
guy. I remember now. What are 

71 



you doing — reading poetry while 
we climb tiie mountain? What 
was that, Bruce — that one about 
the mountain you tried to quote 
to me last night before you . . . 
I can't remember it now. Darling, 
what ... ?" 

¥JE stared at the radio. He hesitateV, reached out and 
switched on the mike. He got 
through to her. 

"Hello, hello, darling," he whispered. "Marsha, can you hear 
me?" 

"Yes, yes. You down there, all 
warm and cozy, reading poetry, 
darling. Where you can see both 
ways instead of just up and down. 
Up and down." 

He tried to imagine where she 
was now as he spoke to her, how 
she looked. He thought of Earth 
and how.it had been there, years 
ago, with Marsha. Things had 
seemed so different then. There 
was something of that hope in his 
voice now as he spoke to her, yet 
not directly to her, as he looked 
out the window at the naked 
frigid sky and the barren rocks. 

*' ' . . . and there ii nowhere to go 
from the top of a mountain, 
But down, my dear; 
And the springs that flow on the 
floor of the valley 
Will never seem fresh or clear 
For think inR of the glitter of the 
mountain water 
In the feathery green of the 
year . . . ' " 



The wind stormed over the 
shelter in a burst of power, buried the sound of his own voice. 

"Marsha, are you still there?" 

"What the devil's the idea, 
poetry at a time like this, or any 
time?" Terrence demanded. "Listen, you taking this down? We 
haven't run into any signs of the 
others. Six hundred thousand feet, 
Bruce! We feel our destiny. We 
conquer the Solar System. And 
we'll go out and out, and we'll 
climb the highest mountain, 
the highest mountain anywhere. 
We're going up and up. We've 
voted on it. Unanimous. We go 
on. On to the* top, Bruce! Nothing can stop us. If it takes ten 
years, a hundred, a thousand 
years, we'll find it. We'll find 
the top ! Not the top of th is 
world — the top of everything. 
The top of the universe!" 

Later, Terrence's voice broke 
off in the middle of something 
or other — Bruce couldn't make 
any sense out of it at all — and 
turned into crazy yells that faded 
out and never came back. 

Bruce figured the others might 
still be climbing somewhere, or 
maybe they were dead. Either 
way it wouldn't make any difference to him. He knew they would 
never come back down. 

He was switching off the radio 
for good when he saw the coloration break over the window. It 
was the same as the dream, but 



THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN 



for an instant, dream and reality 
seemed fused like two superimposed film negatives. 

He went to the window and 
looked out. The comfortable little 
city was out there, and the canal 
flowing past through a pleasantly 
cool yet sunny afternoon. Purple 
mist blanketed the knees of low 
hills and there was a valley, green 
and rich with the trees high and 
full beside the softly flowing canal water. 

The filmy shapes that seemed 
alive, that were partly translucent, drifted along the water's 
edge, and birds as delicate as colored glass wavered down the 
wind. 

He opened the shelter door and 
went out. The shelter looked the 
same, but useless now. How did 
the shelter of that bleak world 
get into this one, where the air 
was warm and fragrant, where 
there was no cold, from that 
world into this one of his dreams? 

The girl — Helene — was standing there leaning against a tree, 
smoking a cigarette. 

He walked toward her, and 
stopped. In the dream it had been 
easy, but now he was embarrassed, in spite of the intimacy 
that had grown between them. 
She wore the same casual slacks 
and sandals. Her hair was brown. 
She was not particularly beautiful, but she was comfortable to 
look at because she seemed so 



peaceful. Content, happy with 
what was and only what was. 

He turned quickly. The shelter 
was still there, and behind it the 
row of spaceships — not like chalk 
marks on a tallyboard now, but 
like odd relics that didn't belong 
there in the thick green grass. Five 
ships instead of four. 

There was his own idHividual 
shelter beyond the headquarters 
building, and the other buildings. He looked up. 

There was no mountain. 

TT^OR one shivery moment he 
knew fear. And then the fear 
went away, and he was ashamed 
of what he had felt. What he had 
feared was gone now, and he 
knew it was gone for good and 
he would never have to fear it 
again. 

"Look here, Bruce. T wpndered 
how long it would take to get 
it through that thick poetic head 
of yours!" 

""Get what?" He began to suspect what it was all about now, 
but he wasn't quite sure yet. 

"Smoke?" she said. 

He took one of the cigarettes 
and she lighted it for him and 
put the lighter back into her 
pocket. 

"It's real nice here," she said. 
"Isn't it?" 

"I guess it's about perfect." 

"It'll be easy. Staying here. I 
mean. We won't be going to

Earth ever again, you know.** 

"I didn't know that, but I 
didn't think we ever would 
again." 

"We wouldn't want to anyway, 
would we, Bruce?" 
"No." 

He kept on looking at the place 
where the mountain had been. Or 
maybe it still was; he couldn't 
make up his mind yet. Which was 
and which was not? That barren 
icy world without life, or this? 

'* */s atl that we see or seem,' " 
he whispered, half to himself, 
" 'but a dream within a dream?' " 

She laughed softly. "Poe was 
ahead of his time." she said. "You 
still don't get it. do you? You 
don't know what's been happening?" 

"Maybe I don't." 

She shrugged, and looked in 
the direction of the ships, "Poor 
guys. I can't feel much hatred 
toward them now. The Martians 
give you a lot of understanding 
of the human mind — after they've 
accepted you, and after you've 
lived with them awhile. But the 
mountain climbers — we can see 
now — it's just luck, chance, we 
weren't like them. A deviant is 
a child of chance." 

"Yes," Bruce said. "There's a 
lot of people like us on Earth, 
but they'll never get the chance 
—the chance we seem to have 
here, to live decently . . . '* 

"You're beginning to see now 



which was the dream," she said 
and smiled. "But don't be pessimistic. Those people on Earth 
will get their chance, too, one of 
these fine days. The Conquerors 
aren't getting far. Venus, and then 
Mars, and Mars is where they 
stop. They'll keep coming here 
and climbing the mountain and 
finally there won't be any more. 
It won't take so long." 

She rose to her toes and waved 
and yelled. Bruce saw Pietro and 
Marlcnc walking hand in hand 
up the other side of the canal. 
They waved back and called and 
then pushed off into the water in 
a small boat, and drifted away 
and out of sight around a gentle 
turn. 

She took his arm and they 
walked along the canal toward 
where the mountain had been, or 
still was — he didn't know. 

A quarter of a mile beyond the 
canal, he saw the high mound 
of red, naked hill, corroded and 
ugly, rising up like a scar of the 
surrounding green. 

She wasn't smiting now. There 
were shadows on her face as the 
pressure on his arm stopped him. 

"I was on the first ship and 
Marlene on the second. None like 
us on the third, and on the fourth 
ship was Pietro. All the others 
had to climb the mountain — ** 
She stopped talking for a moment, and then he felt the pressure of her fingers on his arm. 



THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN

"I'm very glad you came on the 
fifth," she whispered. "Are you 
glad now?" 

"I'm very glad," he said. 

"The Martians tested us," she 
explained. "They're masters of 
the mind. I guess they've been 
grinding along through the evolutionary mill a darn long time, 
longer than we could estimate 
now. They learned the horror 
we're capable of from the first 
ship — the Conquerors, the climbers. The Martians knew more 
like them would come and go on 
into Space, killing, destroying for 
no other reason than their own 
sickness. Being masters of the 
i.-'ind, the Martians are also capable of hypnosis — no, that's not 
really the word, only the closest 
our language comes to naming it. 
Suggestion so deep and strong 
that it seems real to one human 
or a million or a billion; there's 
no limit to the number that can 
be influenced. What the people 
who came off those ships saw 
wasn't real. It was partly what 
the Martians wanted them to see 
and feel — but most of it, like 
the desire to climb the mountain, 
was as much a part of the Conquerors' own psychic drive as it 
Was the suggestion of the Marti- T.." 

f3' c waved her arm slowly to 
e be a peak. "The Mirtians 
r-iride the mountain real. So real 
that it could be seen from space, 



measured by instruments . „ « 
even photographed and chipped 
for rock samples. But you'll see 
how that was done, Bruce, and 
realize that this and not the 
mountain of the Conquerors is 
the reality of Mars. This is the 
Mars no Conqueror will ever see." 

HpHEY walked toward the ugly 
red mound that jutted above 
the green. When they came close 
enough, he saw the bodies lying 
there . . . the remains, actually, 
of what had once been bodies. He 
felt too sickened to go on walking. 

"It may seem cruel now," she 
said, "but the Martians realized 
that there is no cure for the will 
to conquer. There is no safety 
from it, either, as the people of 
Earth and Venus discovered, unless it is given an impossible obstacle to overcome. So the Martians provided the Conquerors 
with a mountain. They themselves 
wanted to climb. They had to." 

He was hardly listening as he 
walked away from Helene toward the eroded hills. The crew 
members v of the first four ships 
were skeletons tied together with 
imperishably strong rope about 
their waists. Far beyond them 
were those from Mars V, too 
freshly dead to have decnyed 
much . . . Anhauser with his rope 
cut, a bullet in his head: Jacobs 
and Marsha and the others . . . 
Terrence much past them all. He 



7* 




 



had managed to climb higher 
than anyone else and he lay with 
his arms stretched out, his fingers 
still clutching at rock outcroppings. 

The trail they left wound over 
the ground, chipped in places for 
holds, red elsewhere with blood 
from torn hands. Terrence was 
more than twelve miles from the 
ship — horizontally. 

Bruce lifted Marsha and carried her back over the rocky dust, 
into the fresh fragrance of the high 
grass, and across it to the shade 
and peace beside the canal. 

He put her down. She looked 
peaceful enough, more peaceful 
than that other time,, years ago, 
when the two of them seemed to 
have shared so much, when the 
future had not yet destroyed her. 
He saw the shadow of Helene 
bend across Marsha's face 
against the background of the 
silently flowing water of the cool, 
green canal. 

"You loved her?" 

"Once," Bruce said. "She might 
have been sane. They got her 
when she was young. Too young 
to fight. But she would have, I 
think, if she'd been older when 
they got her." 

He sat looking down at 
Marsha's face, and then at the 
water with the leaves floating 
down it. 

" ' . . . And the springs that 
flow on the floor of the valley 



will never seem fresh or clear 
for thinking of the glitter of the 
mountain water in the feathery 
green of the year ...'*' 

He stood up, walked back with 
Helene along the canal toward 
the calm city. He didn't look 
back. 

"They've all been dead quite 
a while," Bruce said wonderingly, 
"Yet I seemed to be hearing from 
Terrence until only a short time 
ago. Are — are the climbers still 
climbing — somewhere, Helene?" 

"Who knows?" Helene answered softly. "Maybe. I doubt 
if even the Martians have the 
answer to that." 

They entered the city.

of the Void 



By M1CHAEI SHAARA 




IN the region of the Coal Sack 
Nebula, on the dead fourth 
planet of a star called Tyban, Captain Stiffens of the Mapping Command stood counting 
buildings. Eleven. No, twelve. He 
wondered if there was any significance in the number. He had no 
idea. 

"What do you make of it?" he 
asked. 



Lieutenant Ball, the executive 
officer of the ship, almost tried to 
scratch his head before he remembered that he was wearing, a 
spacesuit. 

"Looks like a temporary 
camp," Ball said. "Very few 
buildings, and all built out of 
native materials, the only stuff 
available. Castaways, maybe?" 
Steffens was silent as he walked 



ORPHANS OF THE VOID 



up onto the rise. The flat weathered stone jutted out of the sand 
before him. 

"No inscriptions," he pointed 
out. 

"They would have been worn 
away. See the wind grooves? 
Anyway, there's not another 
building on the whole damn 
planet. You wouldn't call it much 
of a civilization," 

"You don't think these are native?" 

Ball said he didn't. Steffens 
nodded. 

Standing there and gazing at 
the stone, Steffens felt the awe 
of great age. He had a hunch, 
deep and intuitive, that this was 
old — too old. He reached out a 
gloved hand, ran it gently over 
the smooth stone ridges of the 
wall. Although the atmosphere 
was very thin, he noticed that 
the buildings had no airlocks. 

Ball's voice sounded in his 
helmet: "Want to set up shop, 
Skipper?" 

Steffens paused. "All right, if 
you think it will do any good." 

"You never can tell. Excavation probably won't be much use. 
These things are on a raised rock 
foundation, swept clean by the 
wind. And you can see that the 
rock itself is native — " he indicated the ledge beneath their feet 
— "and was cut out a long while 
back." 

"How long?** 



Ball toed the sand uncomfortably. "I wouldn't like to say offhand." 

"Make a rough estimate." 

Ball looked at the captain, 
knowing what was in his mind. 
He smiled wryly and said: "Five 
thousand years? Ten thousand? I 
don't know." 

Steffens whistled. 

Ball pointed again at the wall. 
"Look at the striations. You can 
tell from that atone. It would 
take even a brisk Earth wind at 
leant several thousand years to 
cut that deep, and fhe wind here 
has only a fraction of that force." 

The two men stood for a long 
moment in silence. Man had been 
in interstellar space for three 
hundred years and this was the 
first uncovered evidence of an 
advanced, space-crossing, alien 
race. It was an historic moment, 
but neither of them was thinking 
about history. 

Man had been in space for only 
three hundred years. Whateverhad built these had been in space 
for thousands of years. 

Which ought to give them, 
thought Steffens uncomfortably, 
one hell of a good head-start. 

WHILE the excav crew 
worked steadily, turning up 
nothing, Steffens remained alone 
among the buildings. Ball came 
out to him, looked dryly at the 
walls. 




 



"Well," he said, "whoever they 
were, we haven't heard from 
them since." 

*'No? How can you be sure?" 
Steffens grunted. "A space-borne 
race was roaming this part of the 
Galaxy while men were still 
pitching spears at each other, that 
long ago. And this planet is only 
a parsec from Variul It, a civilization as old as Earth's. Did whoever built these get to Varius? Or 
did they get to Earth? How can 
you know?" 

He kicked at the sand distractedly. "And most important, 
where are they now? A race with 
several thousand years . . ." 

"Fifteen thousand," Ball said. 
When Steffens looked up, he 
added: "That's what the geology 
boys say. Fifteen thousand, at the 
least." 

Steffens turned to stare unhappily at the buildings. When 
he realized now how really old 
they were, a sudden thought 
'struck him. 

"But why buildings? Why did 
they have to build in stone, to 
last? There's something wrong 
with that. They shouldn't have 
had a need to build, unless they 
were castaways. And castaways 
would have left something behind. The only reason they would 
need a camp would be — " 

"If the ship left and some of 
them stayed." 

Steffens nodded. "But then the 



ship must have come back. Where 
did it go?" He ceased kicking at 
the sand and looked up into the 
blue-black midday sky. "We'll 
never know." 

"How about the other planets?" Ball asked. 

"The report was negative Inner too hot, outer too heavy and 
cold. The third planet is the only 
one with a decent temperature 
range, but it has a CO- atmosphere." 

"How about moons?" 

Steffens shrugged. "We could 
try them and find out." • 

fpHE third planet was a blank, 
gleaming ball until they were 
in close, and then the blankness 
resolved into folds and piling 
clouds and dimly, in places, the 
surface showed through. The ship 
went down through the clouds, 
falling the last few miles on her 
brakers. They came into the misty gas below, leveled off and 
moved along the edge of the twilight zone. 

The moons of this solar system had yielded nothing. The 
third planet, a hot, heavy world 
which had no free oxygen and 
from which the monitors had detected nothing, was all that was 
left. Steffens expected nothing, 
but he had to try. 

At a height of several mites, 
the ship moved up the zone, 
scanning, moving in the familiar 



ORPHANS OF THE VOID 



81 



slow spiral of the Mapping Command. «Faint dark outlines of bare 
rocks and hills moved by below. 

Steffens turned the screen to 
full magnification and watched 
silently. 

After a while he saw a city. 

The main screen being on, the 
whole crew saw it. Someone 
shouted and they stopped to 
stare, and Steffens was about to 
call for altitude when he saw 
that the city was dead. 

He looked down on splintered 
walls that were like cloudy glass 
pieces rising above^a plain, rising 
in a shattered circle. Near the 
center of the c;ty, there was a 
huge, charred hole at least three 
miles in diameter and very deep. 
In all the piled rubble, nothing 
moved. 

Steffens went down low to 
make sure, then brought the. ship 
around and headed out across the 
main continent into the bright 
area of the sun. The rocks rolled 
by below, there was no vegetation at all, and then there were 
more cities — all with the black 
depression, the circular stamp 
that blotted away and fused the 
buildings into nothing. 

No one on the ship had anything to say. None had ever seen 
a war, for there had not been 
war on Earth or near it for more 
than three hundred years. 

The ship circled around to the 
dark side of the planet. When 



they were down below a mile, the 
radiation counters began to react. It became apparent, from the 
dials, that there could be nothing 
alive. 

After a while Ball said: "Well, 
which do you figure? Did our 
friends from the fourth planet do 
this, or were they the same people 
as these?" 

Steffens did not take his eyes 
from the screen. They were coming around to the daylight side. 

"We'll go down and look for 
the answer," he said. "Break out 
the radiation suits." 

He paused, thinking. If the 
ones on the fourth planet were 
alien to this world, they were 
from outer space, could not have 
come from one of the other planets here. They had starships and 
were warlike. Then, thousands of 
years ago. He began to realize 
how important it really was that 
Ball's question be answered. 

When the ship had gone very 
low. looking for a landing site, 
Steffens was still by the screen. 
It was Steffens, then, who saw 
the thing move. 

Down far below, it had been 
a still black shadow, and then it 
moved. Steffens froze. And he 
knew, even at that distance, that 
it was a robot. 

Tiny and black, a mass of 
hanging arms and legs, the thing 
went gliding down the slope of a 
hill. Steffens saw it clearly for a 




 



full second, saw the dull ball of 
its head tilt upward as the ship 
came over, and then the hill was 
past. 

QUICKLY Steffens called for 
height. The ship bucked beneath him and blasted straight 
up; some of the crew went crashing to the deck. Steffens remained 
by the screen, increasing the magnification as the ship drew away. 
And he saw another, then two, 
then a black gliding group, all 
matched with bunches of hanging arms. 

Nothing alive but robots, he 
thought, robots. He adjusted to 
full close up as quickly as he 
could and the picture focused on 
the screen. Behind him he heard 
a crewman grunt in amazement. 

A band of clear, plasticlike stuff 
ran round the head — it would be 
the eye, a band of eye that saw 
all ways. On the top of the head 
was a single round spot of the 
plastic, and the rest was black 
metal, joined, he realized, with 
fantastic perfection. The angle of 
sight was now almost perpendicular. He could see very little of 
the branching arms of the trunk, 
but what had been on the screen 
was enough. They were the most 
perfect robots he had ever seen. 

The ship leveled off. Steffens 
had no idea what to do; the sudden sight of the moving things 
had unnerved him. He had al


ready sounded the alert, flicked 
out the defense screens. Now he 
had nothing to do. He tried to 
concentrate on what the League 
Law would have him do. 

The Law was no help. Contact with planet-bound races was 
forbidden under any circumstances. But could a bunch of 
robots be called a race? The Law 
said nothing about robots because 
Earthmen had none. The building of imaginative robots was expressly forbidden. But at any 
rate, Steffens thought, he had 
made contact already. 

While Steffens stood by the 
screen, completely bewildered for 
the first time in his space career. 
Lieutenant Ball came up, hobbling slightly. From the bright 
new bruise on his cheek, Steffens 
guessed that the sudden climb 
had caught him unaware. The 
exec was pale with surprise. 

"What were they?'* he said 
blankly. "Lord, they looked like 
robots!" 

"They were." 

Ball stared confoundedly at 
the screen. The things were now 
a confusion of dots in the mist. 

"Almost humanoid," Steffens 
said, "but not quite." 

Ball was slowly absorbing the 
situation. He turned to gaze inquiringly at Steffens. v 

"Well, what do we do now?" 

Steffens shrugged. "They saw 
us. We could leave now and let 



ORPHANS OF THE VOID 



them quite possibly make a . . . 
a legend out of our visit, or we 
could go down and see if they tie 
in with the buildings on Tyban 
IV." 

"Can we go down?" 

''Legally? I don't know. If they 
are robots, yes, since robots cannot constitute a race. But there's 
another possibility." He tapped 
'lis fingers on the screen con*" Tusedly. *'They don't have to be 
robots at all. They could be the 
natives." 

Ball gulped. "I don't follow 
you." • 

"They could be the original inhabitants of this planet — the 
brains of them, at least, protected 
in radiation-proof metal. Anyway/' he added, "they're the most 
perfect mechanicals I've ever 
seen." 

Ball shook his head, sat down 
abruptly. Stefj'ens turned from the 
screen, strode nervously across 
the Main Deck, thinking. 

The Mapping Command, they 
called it. Theoretically, all he 
was supposed to do was make a 
closeup examination of unexplored systems, checking for the 
presence of life-forms as well as 
for the possibilities of human colonization. Make a check and 
nothing else. But he knew very 
clearly that if he returned to 
Sinus base without investigating 
this robot situation, he could very 
well be court-martialed one way 



or the other, either for breaking 
the Law of Contact or for dereliction of duty. 

And there was also the possibility, which abruptly occurred 
to him, that the robots might well 
be prepared to blow his ship to 
hell and gone. 

, He stopped in the center of 
the deck. A whole new line of 
thought opened up. If the robots 
were armed and ready . . . could 
this be an outpost? 
An outpost! 

He turned and raced for the 
bridge. If he went in and landed 
and was lost, then the League 
might never know in time. If he 
went in and stirred up trouble . . . 

The thought in his mind was 
scattered suddenly, like a mist 
blown away. A voice was speaking in his mind, a deep calm voice 
that seemed to say: 

"Greetings. Do not be alarmed. 
We do not wish you to be 
alarmed. Our denire is only to 
serve . . ." 

GREETINGS, it s«id! Greetings!" Ball was mumbling 
incredulously through shocked 
lips. 

Everyone on the ship had heard 
the voice. When it ^poke again, 
Steffens was not sure whether it 
was just one voice or many voices. 

"We await your coming," it 
s«id gravely, and repeated: "Our 
desire is only to serve." 



14 




 



And then the robots sent a 
picture. 

As perfect and as clear as a 
tridim movie, a rectangular plate 
took shape in Steffen's mind. On 
the face of the plate, standing 
alone against a background of 
red-brown, bare rocks, was one 
of the robots. With slow, perfect 
movement, the robot carefully 
lifted one of the hanging arms of 
its side, of its right Side, and extended it toward Steffens. a graciously offered hand. 

Steffens felt a peculiar, compelling urge to take the hand, 
realized right away that the urge 
to take the hand was not entirely 
his. The robot mind had helped. 

When the picture vanished, he 
knew that the others had seen 
it He waited for a while; there 
was no further contact, but the 
feeling of the robot's urging was 
still strong within him. He had 
an idea that, if they wanted to, 
the robots could control his mind. 
So when nothing more happened, 
he began to lose his fear. 

While the crew watched in 
fascination, Steffens tried to talk 
back. He concentrated hard on 
what he was saying, said it aloud 
for good measure, then held his 
own hand extended in the robot 
manner of shaking hands. 

"Greetings," he s9W, because it 
was what they had said, and explained: "We have come from the 
stars." 



It was overly dramatic, but so 
was the whole situation. He wondered baffledly if he should have 
let the Alien Contact crew handle 
it. Order someone to stand there, 
feeling like a fool, and think a 
message? 

No. it was his responsibility; 
he had to go on: 

"We request — we respectfully 
request permission to land upon 
your planet." 

OTEFFENS had not realized 
*^ that there were so many. 

They had been gathering since 
his ship was first seen, and now 
there were hundreds of them clustered upon the hill. Others were 
arriving even as the skiff landed; 
they glided in over the rocky hills 
with fantastic ease and power, so 
that Steffens felt a momentary 
anxiety. Most of the robots were 
standing with the silent immobility of metal. Others threaded 
their way to the fore and came 
near the skiff, but none touched 
it, and a circle was cleared for 
Steffens when he came out. 

One of the near robots came 
forward alone, moving, as Steffens now saw, on a number of 
short, incredibly strong and agile 
legs. The black thing paused before him, extended a hand as it 
had done in the picture. Steffens 
took it, he hoped, warmly; felt 
the power of the metal through 
the glove of his suit. 



ORPHANS OF THE VOID 



"Welcome," the robot said, 
speaking again to his mind, and 
now Steffens detected a peculiar 
alteration in the robot's tone. It 
was less friendly now, less — Steffens could not understand — somehow less interested, as if the robot 
had been — expecting someone 
else. 

" Th ank you , ' ' Steff ens sa id. 
"We are deeply grateful for your 
permission to land." 

"Our desire," the robot repeated mechanically, "is only to 
serve." 

Suddenly, Steffens began to 
feel alone, surrounded by machines. He tried to push the 
thought out of his mind, because 
he knew that they should seem 
inhuman. But . . . 

"Will the others come down?" 
asked the robot, still mechanically. 

Steffens felt his embarrassment. 
The ship lay high in the mist 
above, jets throbbing gently. 

"They must remain with the 
ship," Steffens said aloud, trusting to the robot's formality not 
to ask him why. Although, if they 
could read his mind, there was no 
need to ask. 

For a long while, neither spoke, 
long enough for Steffens to grow 
tense and uncomfortable. He 
could not think of a thing to say, 
the robot was obviously waiting, 
and so, in desperation, he signaled the Aliencon men to come 



on out of the skiff. 

They came, wonderingly, and 
the ring of robots widened. Steffens heard the one robot speak 
again. The voice was now much 
more friendly. 

"We hope you will forgive us 
for intruding upon your thought. 
It is our— custom — not to communicate unless we are called 
upon. But when we observed 
that you were in ignorance of 
our real — nature — and were about 
to leave our planet, we decided 
to put aside our custom, so that 
you might base your decision 
upon sufficient data." 

Steffens replied haltingly that 
he appreciated their action. 

"We perceive," the robot went 
on, "that you are unaware of 
our complete access to your mind, 
and would perhaps be — dismayed 
— to learn that we have been 
gathering information from you. 
We must — apologize. Our only 
purpose was so that we could 
communicate with you, Only that 
information was taken which is 
necessary for communication and 
— understanding. We will enter 
your minds henceforth only at 
your request." 

Steffens did not react to the 
news that his mind w-as being 
probed as violently as he might 
have. Nevertheless it ww. a shock, 
and he retreated into observant 
silence as the Aliencon men went 
to work. 



•4 




 



The robot which seemed to 
have been doing the spca ki rig 
was in no way different from any 
of the others in the group. Since 
each of the robots was immediately aware of all that was being 
said or thought, Steffens guessed 
that they had sent one forward 
just for appearance's sake, because they perceived that the 
Earthmen would feel more at 
home. The picture of the extended hand, the characteristic 
handshake of Earthmen, had 
probably been borrowed, too, for 
the same purpose of making him 
and the others feel at ease. The 
one jarring note was the robot's 
momentary lapse, those unexplainable few seconds when the 
things had seemed almost disappointed. Steffens gave up wondering about that and began to 
examine the first robot in detail. 

It was not very tall, being at 
least a foot shorter than the 
Earthmen. The most peculiar 
thing about it, except for the 
circling eye -band of the head , 
was a mass of symbols which 
were apparently engraved upon 
the metal chest. Symbols in row 
upon row — numbers, perhaps — 
were upon the chest, and repeated 
again below the level of the arms, 
and continued in orderly rows 
across the front of the robot, all 
the way down to the base of the 
trunk. If they were numbers, 
Steffens thought, then it was a 



remarkably complicated system. 
But he noticed the same pattern 
on the nearer robots, all apparently identical. He was forced to 
conclude that the symbols were 
merely decoration and let it go 
tentatively at that, although the 
answer seemed illogical. 

It wasn't until he was on his 
way home that Steffens remembered the symbols again. And 
only then did he realized what 
they were. 

A FTER a while, convinced that 
there was no danger, Steffens 
had the ship brought down. When 
the crew came out of the airlock, 
they were met by the robots, and 
each man found himself with a 
robot at his side, humbly requesting to be of service. There 
were literally thousands of the ' 
robots now, come from all over 
the barren horizon. The mass of 
them stood apart, immobile on 
a plain near the ship, glinting in 
the sun like a vast, metallic field 
of black wheat. 

The robots had obviously been 
built to serve. Steffens began to 
feel their pleasure, to sense it in 
spite of the blank, expressionless 
faces. They were almost like 
"children in their eagerness, yet 
they were still reserved. Whoever had boilt them, Steffens 
thought in wonder, had built 
them well. 

Ball came to join Steffens, star

ing at the robots through the 
clear plastic of his helmet with 
taffledly widened eyes. A robot 
moved out from the mass in the 
field, allied itself to him. The 
first to speak had remained with 
Steffens. 

Realizing that the robot could 
hear every word he was saying. 
Ball was for a while apprehensive. But the sheer unreality of 
standing and talking with a multi-limbed, intelligent hunk of dead 
metal upon the bare rock of a 
dead, ancient world, the unreality of it slowly died. It was impossible not to like the things. 
There was something in their 
very lines which was pleasant and 
relaxing. 

Their builders. Steffens thought, 
had probably thought of that, 
too. 

"There's no harm in them, 1 * 
raid Ball at last, openly, not 
minding if the robots heard. 
"They seem actually glad we're 
here. My God, whoever heard of 
a robot being glad?" 

Steffens, embarrassed, spoke 
quickly to the nearest mechanical : "I hope you will forgive us 
cur curiosity, but — yours is a remarkable race. We have never 
before made contact with a race 
like yours." It was said haltingly, 
but it was the best he could do. 

The robot made a singularly 
human nodding motion of its 
head. 



"I perceive that the nature of 

our construction is unfamiliar to 
you. Your question is whether or 
not we are entirely 'mechanical.' 
I am not exactly certain as to 
what the word 'mechanical' is 
intended to convey — I would 
have to examine your thought 
more fully — but I believe that 
there is fundamental similarity 
between our structures." 

The robot paused. Steffens had 
a distinct impression that it was 
disconcerted. 

"I must tell you," the thing 
went on, "that we ourselves arecurious." It stopped suddenly, 
struggling with a word it could 
not comprehend. Steffens waited, 
listening with absolute interest. 
It said at length: 

"We know of only two types 
of living structure. Ours, which 
is largely metallic, and that of the 
Makers, which would appear to 
be somewhat more like yours. I 
am not a— doctor — and therefore 
cannot acquaint you with the specific details of the Makers' composition, but if you arc interested 
I will have a doctor brought forward. It will be glad to be of 
assistance." 

It was Steffens' turn to struggle, and the robot waited patiently while Ball and the second 
robot looked on in silence. The 
Makers, obviously, were whoever 
or whatever h#d built the robots, 
and the "doctors," Steffens de



 



cided, were probably just that 
— doctor- robots, designed specifically to care for the apparently 
flesh-bodies of the Makers. 

The efficiency of the things 
continued to amaze him, but the 
question he had been waiting to 
ask came out now with a rush: 

"Can you tell us where the 
Makers are?" 

Both robots stood motionless. 
It occurred to Steffens that he 
couldn't really be sure which was 
speaking. The voice that came to 
him spoke with difficulty. 

"The Makers — are not here." 

Steffens stared in puzzlement. 
The robot detected his confusion 
and went on: 

"The Makers have gone away. 
They have been gone for a very 
long time." 

Could that be pain in its voice, 
Steffens wondered, and then the 
spectre of the ruined cities rose 
harsh in his mind. 

War. The Makers had all been 
killed in that war. And these had 
not been killed. 

He tried to grasp it, but he 
couldn't. There were robots here 
in the midst of a radiation so 
lethal that nothing, nothing could 
live; robots on a dead planet, 
living in an atmosphere of carbon 
dioxide. 

The carbon dioxide brought 
him up sharp. 

If there had been life here once, 
there would have been plant life 



as well, and therefore oxygen. If 
the war had been so long ago 
that the free oxygen had since 
gone out of the atmosphere — 
good God, how old were the robots? Steffens looked at Ball, then 
at the silent robots, then out 
across the field to where the rest 
of them stood. The black wheat. 
Steffens felt a deep chill. 
Were they immortal? 

•'"TC70ULD you like to see a 
^» doctor?" 

Steffens jumped at the familiar 
words, then realized to what the 
robot was referring. 

"No, not yet," he said, "thank 
you." He swallowed hard as the 
robots continued waiting patient
ly. 

"Could you tell me," he said 
at last, "how old you are? Individually?" 

"By your reckoning," said his 
robot, and paused to make the 
calculation, "I am forty- four 
years, seven months, and eighteen 
days of age, with ten years and 
approximately nine months yet 
to be alive." 

Steffens tried to understand 
that. 

"It would perhaps simplify our 
conversations," said the robot, 
"if you were to refer to me by a 
name, as is your custom. Using 
the first — letters — of my designation, my name would translate as 
Elb." 



ORPHANS OF THE VOID

"Glad to meet you," Steffens 
mumbled. 

"You are called 'Stef ,' " said 
the robot obligingly. Then it 
added, pointing an arm at the 
robot near Ball : "The age of — 
Peb — is seventeen years, one 
month and four days. Peb has 
therefore remaining some thirtyeight years." 



SteFfens was trying to keep up. 
Then the life span was obviously 
about fifty-five years. But the 
cities, and the carbon dioxide? 
The robot, Elb, had said that the 
Makers were similar to him, and 
therefore oxygen and plant life 
would have been needed. Unless — 

He remembered the buildings 
on Tyban IV. 





 



Unless the Makers had not 
come from this planet at all. 

His mind helplessly began to 
revolve. It was Ball who restored 
order. 

"Do you build yourselves?" the 
exec asked. 

Peb answered quickly, that 
faint note of happiness again apparent, as if the robot was glad 



for the opportunity of answering. 

"No, we do not build ourselves. 
We are made by the- — " another 
pause for a word — "by the Factory" 

"The Factory?" 

"Yes. It was built by the Makers. Would you care to see it?" 

Both of the Earthmen nodded 
dumbly.

"Would you prefer to use your 
— skiff? It is quite a long way 
from here." 

It was indeed a long way, even 
by skiff. Some of the Alicncon 
crew went along with them. And 
near the edge of the twilight zone, 
on the other side of the world, 
they saw the Factory outlined 
in the dim light of dusk. A huge, 
fantastic block, wrought of gray 
and cloudy metal, lay in a valley 
between two worn mountains. 
Steffens went down low, circling 
in the skiff, stared in awe at the 
size of the building. Robots 
moved outside the thing, little 
black bugs in the distance — moving around their birthplace. 

rriHE Earthmen remained for 
■ several weeks. During that 
time, Steffens was usually with 
Elb, talking now as often as he 
listened, and the Aliencon team 
roamed the planet freely, investigating what was certainly the 
strangest culture in history. There 
was stilt the mystery of those 
buildings on Tyban IV; that, as 
well as the robots' origin, would 
have to be cleared up before they 
could leave. 

Surprisingly, Steffens did not 
think about the future. Whenever he came near a robot, he 
sensed such a general, comfortable air of good feeling that it 
warmed him, and he was so preoccupied with watching the ro


bots that he did little thinking. 

Something he had not realized 
at the beginning was that he was 
as unusual to the robots as they 
were to him. It came to him with 
a great shock that not one of the 
robots had ever seen a living 
thing. Not a bug, a worm, a leaf. 
They did not know what flesh 
was. Only the doctors knew that, 
and none of them could readily 
understand what was meant by 
the words "organic matter." It 
had taken them some time to 
recognize that the Earthmen wore 
suits which were not parts of their 
bodies, and it was even more difficult for them to understand why 
the suits were needed. 

But when they did under;! ind, 
the robots did a surprising thing. 

At first, because of the excessive radiation, none of the Earthmen could remain outside the 
ship for long, even in radiation 
suits. And one morning, when 
Steffens came out of- the ship, it 
was to discover that hundreds of 
the robots, working through the 
night, had effectively decontaminated the entire area. 

It was at this point that Steffens asked how many robots there 
were. He learned to his amazement that there were more th Ul 
nine million. The great mass of 
them had politely remained a 
great distance from the ship, 
spread out over the planet, since 
they were highly radioactive. 




 



Steffens, meanwhile, courteously allowed Elb to probe into his 
~ mind. The robot extracted all the 
knowledge of matter that Steffens held, pondered over the* 
knowledge and tried to digest it, 
and passed it on to the other 
robote. Steffens, in turn, had a 
difficult time picturing the mind 
of a thing that had never known 
life. 

He had a vague idea of the 
robot's history — more, perhaps, 
then they knew themselves — but 
he refrained from forming an 
opinion until Aliencon made its 
report. What fascinated him was 
Elb's amazing philosophy, the 
only outlook, really, that the 
robot could have had. 

"\S7 HAT do you do? Steffens 

»* asked. 

Elb replied quickly, with characteristic simplicity: "We can do 
very little. A certain amount of 
physical knowledge was imparted to us at birth by the Makers. We spend the main part of 
our time expanding that knowledge wherever possible. We have 
made some progress in the natural sciences, and some in mathematics. Our purpose in being, you 
see, is to serve the Makers. Any 
ability we can acquire will make 
us that much more fit to serve 
when the Makers return." 

"When they return?" It had 
not occurred to Steffens until 



now that the robots expected the 
Makers to do so. 

Elb regarded him out of the 
band of the circling eye. "I see 
you had surmised that the Makers were not coming back." 

If the robot could have laughed, 
Steffens 4 thought it would have, 
then. But it just stood there, 
motionless, its tone politely emphatic. 

"It has always been our belief 
that the Makers would return. 
Why else would we have been 
built?" 

Steffens thought the robot 
would go on, but it didn't. The 
question, to Elb, was no question at all. 

Although Steffens knew already 
what the robot could not possibly 
have known — that the Makers 
were gone and would never come 
back — he was a long time understanding. What he did was push 
this speculation into the back of 
his mind, to keep it from Elb. 
He had no desire to destroy a 
faith. 

But it created a problem in 
him. He had begun to picture 
for Elb the structure of human 
society, and the robot — a machine 
which did not eat or sleep — listened gravely and tried to understand. One day Steffens mentioned God. 

"God?" the robot repeated, 
without comprehension. "What 
is God?" 



ORPHANS OF THE VOID 



93 



Steffens explained briefly, and 
the robot answered: 

"It is a matter which has troubled us. We thought at first that 
you were the Makers returning — " 
Steffens remembered the brief 
lapse , the seeming di sappoi nt ment he had sensed — "hut then 
we probed your minds and found, 
that you were not, that you were 
another kind of being, unlike 
either the Makers or ourselves. 
You were not even — " Elb caught 
himself — "you did not happen to 
be telepaths. Therefore we troubled over who made you. We did 
detect the word 'Maker' in your 
theology, but it seemed to have a 
peculiar — " Elb paused for a long 
while — "an untouchable, intangible meaning which varies among 
you." 

Steffens understood. He nodded. 

The Makers were the robots' 
God. were all the God they 
needed. The Makers had built 
them, the planet, the universe. If 
he were to ask them who made 
the Makers, it would be like their 
asking him who made God. 

It was an ironic parallel, and 
he smiled to himself. 

But on that planet, it was the 
last time he smiled. 

THE report from Aliencon was 
finished at the end of the fifth 
week. Lieutenant Ball brought it 
in to Steffens in his cabin, laid 



it on the desk before him. 

"Get set," Ball advised stiffly, 
indicating the paper. There was 
a strained, brittle expression on 
his face. "I sort of figured it, but 
I didn't know it was this bad." 

When Steffens looked up in 
surprise, Ball said: 

"You don't know. Read it. Go 
ahead." The exec turned tautly 
and left the room. 

Steffens stared after him, then 
looked down at the paper. The 
hint he had of the robots' history 
came back into his mind. Nervously, he picked up the report 
and started to read. 

The story unfolded objectively. 
It was clear and cold, the way 
formal reports must always be. 
Yet there was a great deal of emotion in it. Even Aliencon couldn't 
help that. 

• What it told was this: 

The Makers had been almost 
humanoid. Almost, but with certain notable exceptions. They 
were telepaths — no doubt an im* 
portant factor in their remarkable 
technological progress — and were 
equipped with a secondary pair 
of arms. The robot-doctors were 
able to give flawless accounts of 
their body chemistry, which was 
similar to Earth -type, and the 
rubble of the cities had given a 
certain amount of information 
concerning their society and habits. An attached paper described 
the sociology, but Steffens put it 



»4 




 



aside until sometime later. 

There had been other Factories. 
The remains of them had been 
found in several places, on each 
of the other continents. They had 
been built sometime prior to the 
war, and all but one of the Factories had subsequently been destroyed. 

Yet the Makers were not, as 
Steffens had supposed, a warlike 
people. Telepathy had given them 
the power to know each others* 
minds and to interchange ideas, 
and their record of peace was 
favorable, especially when compared with Earth's. Nevertheless, 
a war had begun, for some reason 
Aliencon could not find, and it 
had obviously gotten out of hand. 

Radiation and bacteria eventually destroyed the Makers; the 
last abortive efforts created 
enough radiation to destroy life 
entirely. There were the germs 
and the bombs and the burning 
rays, and in the end everything 
was blasted and died — everything, that is, but the one lone 
Factory. By a pure, blind freak, 
it survived. 

And, naturally, it kept turning 
out robots. 

It was powered by an atomic 
pile, stocked with materials 
which, when combined with the 
returning, worn-out robots, enabled it to keep producing indefinitely. The process, even of 
repair, was entirely automatic. 



Year after year, the robots 
came out in a slow, steady stream. 
Un governed, un instructed, they 
gathered around the Factory and 
waited, communicated only rarely among themselves. Gradually 
the memory of war, of life — of 
everything but that which was 
imprisoned in their minds at 
birth — was lost. 

The robots kept coming, and 
they stood outside the Factory. 

The robot brain, by far the* 
finest thing the Makers had ever 
built, was variable. There was 
never a genius brain, and never a 
moron brain, yet the intelligence 
of the robots varied considerably 
in between. Slowly, over the long 
years, th,e more intelligent among 
them began to communicate with 
each other, to inquire, and then 
to move away from the Factory, 
searching. 

They looked for someone to 
serve and, of course, there was 
no one. The Makers were gone, 
but the crime was not in that 
alone. For when the robots were 
built, the Makers had done this: 

Along with the first successful 
robot brain, the Makers had 
realized the necessity of creating 
a machine which could never turn 
against them. The present robot 
brain was the result. As Steffens 
had already sensed, the robots 
could feel pain. Not the pain of 
physical injury, for there were no 
nerves in the metal bodies, but 



ORPHANS OF TKE V 01 D 



the pain of frustration, the pressure of thwarted emotion, mental 
pain. 

And so, into the robot brain, 
the Makers had placed this prime 
Directive: the robots could only 
feel content, free from the pain, 
as long as they were serving the 
Makers. The robots must act for 
the Makers, must be continually 
engaged in carrying out the 
wishes of the Makers, or else 
there was a slowly growing irritation, a restlessness and discontent which mounted as the unserving days went by. 

And there were no more Makers to serve. 

t'w *HE pain was not unbearable. 

The Makers themselves were 
not fully aware of the potentialities 
of the robot brain, and therefore 
did not risk deranging it. So the 
pressure reached a peak and leveled off, and for all of the days of 
the robots' lives, they felt it 
never-ending, awake and aware, 
each of them, for fifty-five years. 

And the robots never stopped 
coming. 

A millenium passed, during 
which the robots began to move 
and to think for themselves. Yet 
it was much longer before they 
found a way in which to serve. 

The atomic pile which powered 
the Factory, having gone on for 
almost five thousand years, eventually wore out. The power 



ceased. The Factory stopped. 

It was the first event in the 
robots' history. Never before had 
there been a time when they had 
known anything at all to alter 
the course of their lives, except 
the varying weather and the unvarying pain. There was one 
among them now that began to 
reason. 

It saw that no more robots were 
being produced, and although it 
could not be sure whether or not 
this was as the Makers had ordained, it formed an idea. If the 
purpose of the robots was to 
serve, then they would fail in 
that purpose if they were to die 
out. The robot thought this and 
communicated it to the others, 
and then, together, they began to 
rebuild the pile. 

It was not difficult. The necessary knowledge was already in 
their minds, implanted at birth. 
The significance lay in the fact 
that, for the first time in their 
existence, the robots had acted 
upon their own initiative, had begun to serve again. Thus the pain 
ceased. 

When the pile was finished, the 
robots felt the return of the pain 
and, having once begun, they 
continued to attempt to serve. A 
great many examined the Factory, found that they were able to 
improve upon the structure of 
their bodies, so that they might 
be better able to serve the Ma


GALAXY SClENCt FICTION 



kers when they returned. Accordingly, they worked in the Factory, 
perfecting themselves — although 
they could not improve the brains 
— and many others left the Factory and began to examine mathematics and the physical universe. 

It was not hard for them to 
build a primitive spaceship, for 
the Makers had been on the verge 
of interstellar flight, and they 
flew it hopefully throughout the 
solar system, looking to see if the 
Makers were there. Finding no 
one, they left the buildings on 
Tyban IV as a wistful monument, with a hope that the Makers would some day pass this 
way and be able to use them. 

Millenia passed. The pile broke 
down again, was rebuilt, and so 
the cycle was repeated. By infinitesimal steps, the robots 
learned and recorded their learning in the minds of new robots. 
Eventually they reached the limits of their capability. 

The pain returned and never 
left. 

STEFFENS left his desk, went 
over and leaned against the 
screen. For a long while he stood 
gazing through the mists of carbon air at the pitiful, loyal mechanicals who thronged outside 
the ship. He felt an almost overwhelming desire to break something, anything, but all he could 
do was swear to himself. 

tr 



Ball came back, looked at Steffens' eyes and into them. His own 
were sick. 

"Twenty-five thousand years," 
he said thickly, "that's how long 
it was. Twenty - five thousand 
years . . ." 

Steffens was pale and wordless. 
The mass of the robots outside 
stood immobile, ageless among 
rock which was the same, hurting, hurting. A fragment of an 
old poem came across Steffens' 
mind. "They also serve who only 
stand and wait ..." 

Not since he was very young 
had he been so deeply moved. He 
stood up rigidly and began to 
talk to himself, saying in his 
mind : 

It is all over now. To hell with 
what is past. We will take them 
away from this place and let them 
serve and, by God . „ . 

He faltered. But the knowledge 
of what could be done strengthened him. Earthmen would have 
to come in ships to take the robots away. It would be a little 
while, but after all those years a 
little while was nothing, less than 
nothing. He stood there thinking 
of the things the robots could do, 
of how. in the Mapping Command alone, they would be invaluable. Temperature and atmosphere meant nothing to them. 
They could land on almost any 
world, could mine and build and 
develop . . . 



And so it would be ended. The 
robots would serve Man. 

Steffens took one long, painful 
breath. Then he strode from the 
room without speaking to Ball, 
went forward to the lockers and 
pulled out a suit, and a moment 
later he w^is in the airlock. 

He had one more thing to do, 
and it would be at once the gladdest and most difficult job that 
he had ever attempted. He had 
to tell the robots. 

He had to go out into the sand 
and face them, tell them that all 
of the centuries of pain had been 
for nothing, that the Makers 
were dead and would never return, that every robot built for 
twenty-five thousand years had 
been just surplus, purposeless. 
And yet — and this was how he 
was able to do it — he was also 
coming to tell them that the 
wasted years were over, that the 
years of doing had begun. 

As he stepped from the airlock 
he saw Elb standing, immobile, 
waiting by the ship. In the last 
few seconds Steffens realized that 
it was not necessary to put this 
into words. 

When he reached the robot, he 
put forth a hand and touched 
Elb's arm, and said very softly: 

"Elb, my friend, you must look 
into my mind — " 

And the robot, as always, 
obeyed.

AT the risk of being blamed for 
inventing a brand-new variety of nepotism, I'm going to begin this column with an answer to 
a question asked of me by my 
own eight-year-old daughter. One 
day, probably thinking back to a 



visit to the meteorite collection 
in the Hayden Planetarium, she 
asked : "Daddy, has anybody ever 
been hurt by a meteorite?" I happened to know that this had occurred more than once: naturally, 
such strange cases were always 




FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



99 



recorded, and so I could answer 
the question in the affirmative. 

Let's forget for a moment that 
there are such cases on record, 
however, and try to work up the 
statistical probabilities" instead. 
We all know that meteorites come 
in all sizes, from particles'as small 
as grains of fine sand, making a 
barely visible streak of light in 
the night sky, to hefty chunks 
Jike Ahnighito from Greenland, 
which weighs around 35 tons, and 
the one at Hoba West near Grootfontein in Southwest Africa, 
which is still in the ground and 
has been estimated by some to 
weigh 60 tons. Those which make 
impressive streaks of light in the 
sky and can almost be said to 
illuminate a night landscape momentarily are nevertheless tiny 
bits of cosmic matter. 

A bright meteor with a visual 
magnitude of "2ero" — like a very 
bright star — is caused by a meteorite with a mass of % gram. 
One with a visual magnitude of 
"minus three" — a newspaper 
probably would headline it 
"blinding meteor flashes across 
city; harmless, scientists say" 
—has a mass of 4 grams. And 
there are 28 grams to the ounce. 
Meteorites that small never even 
reach the ground. 

The next question in our statistical analysis would be how 
numerous meteorites are. The best 
available answer is that, count


ing only those of visual magnitude "zero" or brighter, there are 
450,000 per 24-hour day. Among 
them there are perhaps half a 
dozen large enough to reach the 
ground. Every day. Earth sweeps 
a small truck-load of fine sand, 
with a few pebbles in it, out of 
the sky. If that rate has been 
maintained for the last two billion years, which is doubtful, this 
accumulation of cosmic sand has 
increased Earth's diameter by 
ahout half an inch. 

All right, then, a few pebbles 
a day. The area of Earth's surface is 197 million square miles. 
The oceans cover 1 40 million 
square miles and, as*far as the 
endangered population is concerned, you can subtract another 
half million square miles for the 
combined area of all lakes and 
another 6 million square miles 
for Antarctica, where nobody 
lives. ■ This leaves 50 million 
square miles of area where somebody might be hit; in round figures, one-quarter of the total surface. 

If eight meteorites per 24-hour 
day are large enough to reach the 
ground, just two of them will hit 
inhabited or inhabitable hind. 
You don't have to go on and 
establish the average number of 
people per square mile and the 
percentage of a square mile covered by the area of the average 
number of inhabitants. From 



>00 



* A I A X Y SCIENCI FICTION 



statistics alone, you'd learn that 
it is virtually impossible for a 
person to be the accidental target 
of a metorite. 

The actual historical records 
tell a different tale. What may 
be taken as the oldest reported 
case is the one in the Bible (Joshua 10:11) ". . . as they fled from 
before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the 
Lord cast down great stones from 
heaven upon them unto Azakah, 
and they died. ..." The date, 
roughly, would be 1500 B. C. Of 
the meteorites mentioned in classical literature, only one is considered as "certain," a "stone the 
size of a chferiot" which fell on 
the Greek mainland — in Thrace— 
in 476 B. C. It was described by 
Pliny the Elder and was still extant in his time, but if it did any 
damage, that fact was not recorded. The second case of fatalities 
due to meteorites was located by 
the French scientist Biot almost 
a hundred and fifty years ago. 
In January, 616 A.D., according 
to Chinese chronicles, a large 
stone fell in China, crushing wagons and killing ten men. 

The next case is the most famous one for more than a few 
reasons. It happened in Crema. 
a city near Milan in Italy. It 
took place, by a strange coincidence, during an eclipse of the 
Sun. And Raffaelo Santi, or Raphael, painted the event. The date 



was the 14th of September, 1511, 
and it must have been a large 
meteorite which entered the 
Earth's atmosphere and exploded. 
About a thousand stones pelted 
the area, killed birds and sheep 
and a Franciscan friar. 

In 1569 — oddly enough, also on 
September 14 — several meteorites 
struck Venice, causing damage to 
buildings, but no loss of life. In 
1650. on September 4th, a smalt 
stone descended on the grounds of 
a Franciscan monastery in Milan, 
killing one of the monks. In 1654, 
a sailing ship returned to the 
Mediterranean from Japan and 
the captain reported that during 
the voyage, which lasted a number of years, a meteorite weighing some nine pounds had hit the 
bridge, killing two sailors. 

The more recent the reports, 
the more specific they are in detail. Lincoln LaPaz of the Institute of Meteorites (U. of New 
Mexico) recently compiled a list 
containing the following cases: 

1794, June 16, 7:00 PM: fall of chondrites (stony meteorite*) at Siena, 
Italy; one atone pierced the hat »' 
a child, no injuries 

1825, January 16: meteorite fall at 
Oriang (India) killed a man and 
seriously injured a woman 

1827, February 16, 2:00 PM: meteorite 
fall at Mhow (India) wounded a 
man in one arm 

1836, November 11, 5:00 AM: several 
cattle killed by fall of stony meteorites at Macao, Brazil 

1847, July 14, 3:45 AM: fall at Braunau, Austria, mass weighing 37*/$

sleeping children, covered them with 
debris without doing other harm 

I860, May 1, 12:45 PM: colt killed 
at New Concord, Ohio 

1870, January 23, 7:00 PM: a man 
was very narrowly missed by a meteorite at Nedagolla, India 

1911, June 28, 9:00 AM: a dog was 
killed at Nakhla, Egypt 

1927, April 28, 9:00 AM: at Aba, 
Japan, a meteorite (preserved, 
weighing only 0.9 grams) struck and 
slightly injured the five-year old 
daughter of Mr. Tahei Kuriyama 

1938, June 24, 6:05 PM: at Chicora. 
Pennsylvania, a cow was found with 
its hide torn as if by a falling stone. 
This was immediately after a recognized meteorite fall; meteorites were 
found in neighboring fields. 

To this list compiled by Prof. 
LaPaz, two cases can be added, 
one of them doubtful. The doubtful case occurred in 1915 in 
northern Germany (Pomerania or 
Mecklenburg), where several 
sheep burned to death in a fire 
in a hayloft alleged to have been 
caused by a meteorite. To the 
best of my knowledge, the meteorite was never found. 

The other case is the so-called 
Benld Meteorite to which the 
Chicago Natural History Museum 
has just devoted a special paper 
(Geological Series, vol. vii, No. 
110 It fell on September 29, 1938, 
between 9:00 and 9:10 AM at 
Benld, Macoupin County, Illinois. It was a rather large chondrite, weighing 1770.5 grams or 
3.9 lbs. The Benld meteorite did 
not injure anybody, but broke 



through the roof of a garage, the 
roof of the car parked inside, 
through the seat cushion and the 
car's floor. It struck the muffler 
next, denting it and then bounced 
back to come to rest entangled 
in the seat springs. 

Against all statistical probability, then, meteorites have hit 
and killed people. But it may be 
generations between now and the 
next instance. 

VISITORS to a planetarium 
often ask whether it is possible to produce a picture of the 
sky in, say, 23S2 A.D. or of the 
time of Shalmaneser I of Assyria, 
who began his rule probably in 
1276 B.C. Of course, that can be 
done: in December of every year, 
most planetariums set their instrument back to the time of 
Christ. (The director usually 
winces a bit when December rolls 
around, for that needs some 20 
hours running time, which wears 
out cog wheels and is hard on the 
bearings.) 

But when you go back to 2000 
B.C., you have to be several hours 
off if you want to reproduce a 
specific time — say, midnight The 
instrument is not corrected for the 
fact that the length of the day 
changes slightly. The best present estimate is that the day 
lengthens at the rate of 0.001 seconds per century. Over an interval of 4000 years, that makes the 



103 




 



day of Shalmaneser's time 0.04 
seconds shorter than it is now. 
Hardly . noticeable — but 4000 
years contain about 1,4.00,000 
days. The average discrepancy 
for every day would thus be 0.002 
seconds, which totals up to 
28,000 seconds, or eight hours. 

This, according to Prof. George 
Gamow, is the reason why the 
ancients observed eclipses which, 
if calculated without that correction factor, should have been below the horizon for them. 

LET'S talk about a yard of 
string now, to give a wonderful example of how "reasoning" can lead you astray. The 
circumference of the Earth along 
the equator is 24,902 miles or, 
since there are 1760 yards in a 
mile, 43,827,520 yards. Now we'll 
level all the mountains that happen to be along the equator and 
put a string around, at sea level, 
tight. And now we lengthen this 
string by precisely one yard. How 
high, provided that it is supported all around the equator at the 
same distance, would that string 
be above sea level? 

"Reasoning" will say, without 
a moment's hesitation, that it will 
be insignificant. Possibly a bacillus, if it really wanted to, could 
squeeze across the equator under 
that string. The truth is that a 
cat could do it, for the string 
would be about six inches above 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



the ground. 

Impossible? Let's see what the 
radius of the larger circle would 
be — we are all agreed that it 
must be larger; being one yard 
longer, the question is merely 
whether it would be visible. The 
original sea level circle was given 
by 2r x tt. the new circle is obviously 2 r x + 1 (if "r" has 
been expressed in yards) and the 
new radius R must be r -f- x. 
And x turns out to be I divided 
by 2 jr. If we take w as 3.1415, 
this gives 0.1592 of a yard, or 5.8 
inches. 

The point is here that the increase of the radius is independent of the originat radius. The 
increase of the radius must always 
be equal to the increase in the 
circumference divided by 2 w. 

Go ahead and try it with anything circular you have access 
to. You'll always find that an 
increase of the original circumference by one yard will increase 
the radius by slightly less than 
six inches. 

In case neither the formula nor 
the experiments fully convince 
you, you may imagine another 
example which might help. Here 
we have a board three yards long 
— but we imagine it to be so thin 
that its thickness is negligible — 
and we tie a string around lengthwise. Obviously the string will be 
six yards long. 

Now we lengthen the string 

103 



once more by one yard. The result will be two loops at both 
ends, each loop sticking out by 
one quarter of a yard or 9 inches. 
Here it is apparent that it would 
not matter whether the board is 
originally three yards long, or 
100 yards, or 77 miles. If you 
add a yard to the length of the 
tight string, you'll always get two 
loops at both ends, sticking out 
a full nine inches. 

Common sense, as you can see, 
is not always common, which has 
been noted by others in the past 
— but neither does it always make 
sense!

ANY QUESTIONS? 

A handbook stated the temperature of the high atmosphere as 
2500° Kelvin lor an altitude of 
650 kilometers and continues: 
"this would make space flight 
virtually impossible; this temperature is well above the melting 
point of most metals and above 
the vaporization point of many." 

Richard Hanna, 
83 Edgewood St. 
Hartford, Conn. 
These figures have proved 
enormously misleading to many 
people — they don't mean at all 
what they seem to mean. You 
know that the speed of air molecules increases willi temperature, so you could express a 



given temperature by mentioning the average speed of the 
air molecules. Conversely, yon 
can express the average speed 
of air molecules by temperalure. This is what such tables 
usually do, and some physicisls 
are careful to refer to them as 
''kinetic temperatures." But llie 
kinetic temperature of 2500° 
Kelvin all 650 Kilometers altitude does not mean that a 
rocket would acquire that temperature up there. The '''kinetic temperature" merely 
states how fast the air molecules 
move; it says nothing about 
whether there are enough air 
molecules up there lo matter. 
There aren't. 

For rockets large enough lo 
have the pay load capacity lo 
carry a pilot, air resistance virtually ceases as low as 20 miles 
above sea level. Beyond that, 
the air is loo thin lo influence 
either the movement or the 
temperature of a rocket.

There is no insulator known. 
For practical purposes, one ran

T have read that in some parts 
of the Milky Way there are interstellar whisps of gas, mostly 
hydrogen. Why doesn't this gaa 
diffuse in the vacuum of interstellar space? 

Is the mention of the planet 
Vulcan — supposed to be inside 
the orbit of Mercury — in a few 
science fiction stories based on 
any factual evidence? 

Joseph . Russo 
1941 62nd Street 



Brooklyn 4, N. Y. 

The whisps of gas would diffuse inio space if they were 
warm enough. Some of them 
are definitely black and visible 
only because^ they obscure portions of the Milky Way; others 
which are luminous do not glow 
with heat. In short, they are 
cold enough so that the mutual 
attraction of their particles 
holds them together. 

As for the planet Vulcan inside the orbit of Mercury, 
astronomical circles believed in 
its existence for some threequarters of a century. It was 
assumed to exist because the 
orbit of Mercury seemed to require another planet nearer the 
Sun. Observers, both professional astronomers and ania* 
teurs, set out to watch for it, 
especially at the occasion of solar eclipses. 

One observer (a German living in China) thought he had 
seen Vulcan puss across the 
disk of the Sun. Bui the Ohserv* 
atory in Madrid, having bigger 
instruments, recognized it as a 
roughly circular suuspot. Two 
observers (one American, one 
Englishman) thought they had 
discovered it during an eclipse, 
but it turned out to be a small 
reddish fixed star that happened to be in line of sight. 
A French country doctor named ' 
Lescarbault actually received

• A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



the Iriiion tVhonneur for "the 
discovery of Vulcan" in March 
1859. He had "seen" it crow* 
ihc disk of the Sun. 

But if Vulcan really existed, 
we should have found it hy now. 
What Lescarhault actually saw 
was probably one of the planetoids which approach the Sun 
more closely than the Earth on 
occasion. Since the existence of 
these planetoids was not known 
then, and since Vulcan was on 
the list of things to he found, 
his mistake is easily explained. 

Ronald Demovsky {no address 
given) wonders about the statement in my first column where I 
said that J-1V (Callisto) has been 
seen "perfectly black," since a 
"perfectly black" body would be 
invisible. Or did I mean that J -IV 
was in Jupiter's shadow? 

I did not mean the term 
"perfectly black" quite so rigorously. But even a perfectly 
black body can be seen— 
against a lighter background. 
This, of course, is what the obernrrs meant; they referred to 



a transit, not to an eclipse. 

In your book Rockets, Missiles 
and Space Travel, you state that 
the condition of apparent weightlessness occurs only rarely and for 
very short periods. 

I would like to know just when 
it takes place. 

S. Petinga 

4129 Winchester Avenue 
Atlantic City, N. J. 
It takes place when man is 
falling freely; for example, 
when jumping from a diving 
board, and during the early 
stages of a parachute jump before the parachute is opened, 
when air resistance has not yet 
slowed the person down. One 
other possibility is a carefully 
controlled power dive where 
the plane develops just enough 
power to overcome air resistance. Since this may prolong the state of weightlessness 
for many minutes, Dr. Haber of 
the USAF Department of Space 
Medicine has suggested using 
such controlled power dives for 
the study of the problem.

tf Oltie knew the work be wat 
doing, he would have resigned 
— if resigning were possible! 



Shipping Clerk 

By WILLIAM MORRISON 



IF there had ever been a time 
when Otlie Keith hadn't been 
hungry, it was so far in the 
past that he couldn't remember 
it. He was hungry now as he 
walked through the alley, his eyes 
shifti ng lusterlessly from one 
heap of rubbish to the next. He 
was hungry through and through, 
all one hundred and forty pounds 
of him, the flesh distributed so 
gauntly over his tall frame that 
in spots it seemed about to wear 
through, as his clothes had. That 
it hadn't done so in forty-two 



years sometimes struck Otlie as 
in the nature of a miracle. 

He worked for a junk collector 
and he was unsuccessful in his 
present job, as he had been at 
everything else. Oltie had followed the first part of the ragsto-riches formula with classic 
exactness. He had been born to 
rags, and then, as if that hadn't 
been enough, his parents had 
died, and he had been left an 
orphan. He should have gone to 
the big city, found a job in the 
rich merchant's counting house,

end saved the pretty daughter, 
acquiring her and her fortune in 
the process. , 

It hadn't worked out that way. 
In the orphanage where he had 
spent so many unhappy years, 
both his food and his education 
had been skimped. He had later 
been hired out to a farmer, but 
he hadn't been strong enough tor 
farm labor, and he had been sent 
back. 

His life since then had followed 
an unhappy pattern. Lacking 
strength and skill, he had been 
unable to find and hold a good 
job. Without a good job, he had 
been unable to pay for the food 
and medical care, and for the 
training he would have needed to 
acquire strength and skill. Once, 
in the search for food and training, he had offered himself to the 
Army, but the doctors who examined him had quickly turned 
thumbs down, and the Army had 
rejected him with contempt. 
They wanted better human material than that. 

How he had managed to survive at all to the present was another miracle. By this time, of 
course, he knew, as the radio 
comic put it, that he wasn't long 
for this world. And to make the 
passage to another world even 
easier, he had taken to drink. 
Rot gut stilled the pangs of 
hunger even more effectively than 
inadequate food did. And it gave 



him the first moments of happiness, spurious though they were, 
that he could remember. 

Now, as he sought through the 
heaps of rubbish for usable rags 
or redeemable milk bottles, his 
eyes lighted on something unexpected. Right at the edge of the 
curb lay a small nut. specie? indeterminate. If he had his usual 
luck, it would turn out to be 
withered inside, but at least he 
could hope for the best. 

HE picked up the nut, banged 
it futilely against the ground, 
and then looked around for a 
rock with which to crack it. None 
was in sight. Rather fearfully, he 
put it in his mouth and tried to 
crack it between his teeth. His 
teeth were in as poor condition 
as the rest of him. and the 
chances were that they would 
crack before the nut did. 

The nut slipped and Oil ie gurgled, threw his hands into the air 
and almost choked. Then he got 
it out of his wmdpipe and. a 
second later, breathed easily. The 
nut was in his stomach, still uncracked. And Ollie, it seemed to 
him, was hungrier than ever. 

The alley was a failure. His 
life had been a progression from 
rags to rags, and these last rags 
were inferior to the first. There ■ 
were no milk bottles, there was 
no junk worth salvaging. 

At the end of the alley was a

barber shop, and here Ollie had 
a great and unexpected stroke of 
luck. He found a bottle. The bottle was no container for milk and 
it wasn't empty. It was standing 
on a smalt table near an open 
window in the rear of the barber 
shop. Oltie found that he could 
get it by simply stretching out 
his long, gaunt arm for it. without climbing in through the window at all. 

He took a long swig, and then 
another. The liquor tasted far 
better than anything he had ever 
bought. " 

When he returned the bottle 
to its place, it was empty. 

Strangely enough, despite its 
excellent quality, or perhaps, he 
thought, because of it, the whiskey failed to have its usual effect 
on him. It left him completely 
sober and clear-eyed, but hungrier than ever. 

In his desperation, Ollie did 
something that he seldom dared 
to do. He went into a restaurant, 
not too good a restaurant or he 
would never have been allowed 
to take a seat, and ordered a 
meal he couldn't pay for. 

He knew what would happen, 
of course, after he had eaten. He 
would put on an act about having lost his money, but that 
wouldn't fool the manager for 
more than one second. If the 
man was feeling good and needed 
help, he'd let Ollie work the price 



out washing dishes. If he was a 
little grumpy and had all the 
dishwashers he needed, he'd have 
them boot the tar out of Ollie 
and then turn him over to the 
police. 

The soup was thick and tasty, 
although tasty in a way that no 
gourmet would have appreciated. 
The mess was food, however, and 
Ollie gulped it down gratefully. 
But it did nothing to satisfy his 
hunger. Likewise, the stew had 
every possible leftover thrown 
into it, and none of it gave Ollie 
any feeling of satisfaction. Even 
the dessert and the muddy coffee 
left him as empty as before. 

The waiter had been in the 
back room with the cook. Now 
Ollie saw him signal to the manager, and watched the manager 
hasten back. He closed his eyes. 
They were onto him; there was 
no doubt about it. For a moment 
he considered trying to get out 
of the front door before they 
closed in, but there was another 
waiter present, keeping an eye on 
the patrons, and he knew that he 
would never make it. He took a 
deep breath and waited for the 
roof to fall in on him. 

He heard the manager's footsteps and opened his eyes. The 
manager said, "Uh — look, bud, 
about that meal you ate — " 

"Not bad," observed Ollie 
brightly. 

"Glad you liked it." 



no 




 



He noticed little beads of sweat 
on the manager's forehead, and 
wondered what had put them 
there. He said, "Only trouble is, 
it ain't fillin'. I'm just as hungry 
as I was before." 

"It didn't fill you up, huh? 
That's too bad. I'll tell you what 
I'll do. Rather than see you go 
away dissatisfied, I won't charge 
you for the meal. Not a cent." 

Ollie blinked. This made no 
sense whatever. All the same, if 
not for the gnawing in his stomach, he would have picked himself up and run. As it was, he 
said, "Thanks. Guess in that case 
I'll have another order of stew. 
Maybe this time it'll stick to my 
ribs." 

"Not the stew," replied the 
manager nervously. "You had the 
last that was left. Try the roast 
beef." 

"Hmm, that's more than I was 
gonna spend." 

"No charge," said the manager. "For you, no charge at all." 

"Then gimme a double order. 
I feel starved." 

The double order went down 
the hatch, yet Ollie felt just as 
empty as ever. But he was afraid 
to press his luck too far, and 
after he had downed one more 
dessert — also without charge — he 
reluctantly picked himself up and 
walked out. He was too hungry 
to spend any more time wondering why he had got a free meal. 



In the back room of the restaurant, the manager sank weakly 
into a chair. "I was afraid he was 
going to insist on paying for it. 
Then we'd really have been on a 
«pot." 

"Guess he was too glad to get 
it for free," the cook said. 

"Well, if anything happens to 
him now, it'll happen away from 
here." 

"Suppose they take a look at 
what's in his stomach." 

"He still won't be able to sue 
us. What did you do with the rest 
of that stew?" 

"It's in the garbage." 

"Cover it up. We don't want 
dead cats and dogs all over the 
place. And next time you reach 
for the salt, make sure there isn't 
an insect powder label on it." 

"It was an- accident; it could 
happen to anybody," said the 
cook philosophically. "You know, 
maybe we shouldn't have let that 
guy go away.; Maybe we ought 
to have sent him to a doctor." 

"And pay his bills? Don't be 
a sap. From now on, he's on his 
own. Whatever happens to him, 
we df>n't know anything about it. 
We never saw him before." 

rpHE only thing that was bappening to Ollie was that he 
was getting hungrier and hungrier. He had, in fac>. never before been so ravenous. He felt as 
if he hadn't eaten in years.

in 



He had met with two strokes 
of luck — the accessible bottle and 
the incredibly generous manager. 
They had left him just as hungry 
and thirsty as before. Now he 
encountered a third gift of fortune. On the plate glass window 
of a restaurant was the flamboyant announcement: eating contest TONIGHT AT MONTE'S RESTAURANT! For the Championship 
of the World! Entries Being 
Taken now! No Charge if you 
Eat Enough for at Least 
Tmhi.k People. 

Ollie's face brightened. The 
way he felt, he could have eaten 
enough for a hundred. The fact 
that the contestants, as he saw 
upon reading further, would be 
limited to hard-boiled eggs mode 
no difference to him. For once he 
would have a chance to eat everything he could get down his 
yawning gullet. 

That night it was clear that 
neither the judges nor the audience thought much of Ollie as an 
eater. Hungry he undoubtedly 
was, but it was obvious that his 
stomach had shrunk from years 
of disuse, and besides, he didn't 
have the build of a born eater. 
He was long and skinny, whereas 
the other contestants seemed almost as broad and wide as they 
were tall. In gaining weight, as 
in so many other things, the 
motto seemed to be that those 
who already had would get more. 



Ollie had too little to start with. 

In order to keep the contest 
from developing an anticlimax, 
they started with Ollie, believing 
that he would be lucky if he ate 
ten eggs. 

Ollie was so ravenous that he 
found it difficult to control himself, and he made a bad impression by gulping the first egg as 
fast as he could. A real eater 
would have let the egg slide down 
rapidly yet gently, without making an obvious effort. This uncontrolled, amateur speed, 
thought the judges, could only 
lead 1 to a stomachache. 

Ollie devoured the second egg, 
the third, the fourth, and the rest 
of his allotted ten. At that point, 
one of the judges asked, "How 
do you feel?" 

"Hungry." 

"Stomach hurt?" 

"Only from hunger. It feels like 
it got nothin' in it. Somehow, 
them eggs don't fill me up." 

Somebody in the audience 
laughed. The judges exchanged 
glances and ordered more eggs 
brought on. From the crowd of 
watchers, cries of encouragement 
came to Ollie. At this stage, there 
was still nobody who thought 
that he had a chance. 

Ollie proceeded to go through 
twenty eggs, forty, sixty, a hundred. By that time, the judges 
and the'erowd were in a state of 
unprecedented excitement.

Again a judge demanded, 

"How do you feel?" 

"Still hungry. They don't fill 
me up at all." 

"But those are large eggs. Do 
you know how much a hundred 
of them weigh? Over fifteen 
pounds!" 

"I don't care how much they 
weigh. I'm still hungry." 

"Do you mind if we weigh 
you?" 

"So long as you don't stop 
givin' me eggs, okay." 

They brought out a scale and 
Ollie stepped on it. He weighed 
one hundred and thirty -nine 
pounds, on the nose. 

Then he started eating eggs 
again. At the end of his second 
hundred, they weighed him once 
more. Ollie weighed one hundred 
thirty-eight and three-quarters. 

The judges stared at each other 
and then at Ollie. For a moment 
trie entire audience sat in awed 
silence, as if watching a miracle. 
Then the mood of awe passed. 

One of the judges said wisely, 
"He palms them and slips them 
to a confederate." 

"Out here on the stage?" demanded another judge. "Where's 
his confederate? Besides, you can 
see for yourself that he eats them. 
You can watch them going down 
his throat," 

"But that's impossible. If they 
really went down his throat, he'd 
gain weight." 



"I don't know how he does it.* 
admitted the other. "But he 
does." 

"The man is a freak. Let's get 
some doctors over here." 

Ollie ate another hundred and 
forty-three eggs, and then had to 
stop because the restaurant ran 
out of them. The other contestants never even had a chance to 
get started. 

WHEN the doctor came and 
they told him the story, Ins 
firsl impulse seemed to be to grin. 
He knew a practical joke when 
he heard one. But they put Ollie 
on the scales — by this time he 
weighed only a hundred thirtyeight and a quarter pounds — and 
fed him a two pound loaf of 
bread. Then they weighed him 
again. 

He was an even one hundred 
and thirty-eight. 

"At' this rate, he'll starve to 
death," said the doctor, who 
opened his little black bag and 
proceeded to give Ollie a thorough examination. 

Ollie was very unhappy about 
it because it interfered with his 
eating, and he felt more hungry 
than ever. But they promised to 
feed him afterward and. more or 
less unwillingly, he submitted. 

"Bad teeth, enlarged heart, lesion on each lung, flat feet, hernia, 
displaced vertebrae — you name it 
and he has it." said the doctor.

"Where the devil did he come 
from?" 

OUie was working on an order 
of roast beef and was too busy to 
reply. 

Somebody said, "He's a ragpicker. I've seen him around." 

"When did he start this eating 
spree?" 

With stuffed mouth, OUie 
mumbled, "Today." 

"Today, eh? What happened 
today that makes you able to eat 
so much?" 

"I just feel hungry." 

"I can see that. Look, how 
about going over to the hospital 
m we can really examine you?" 

"No, sir," said Ollie. "You ain't 
pokin' no needles into me." 

"No needles," agreed the doctor hastily. If there was no other 
way to get blood samples, they 
could always drug him with morphine and he'd never know what 
bad happened. "We'll just look 
at you. And we'll feed you all 
you can eat." 

"All I can eat? It's a deal!" 

THE humor was crude, but it 
put the point across — the photographer assigned to the contest 
had snapped a picture of Ollie 
in the middle of gulping two eggs. 
One was traveling down his gullet, causing a lump in his throat, 
and the other was being stuffed 
into his mouth at the same time.

Zolto put the paper down. 
"This is the one," he said to his 
wife. "There can be no doubt that 
this person has found it." 

"I knew it was no longer in 
the alley," said Pojim. Ordinarily 
a comely female, she was now 
deep in thought, and succeeded 
in looking beautiful and pensive 
at the same time. "How are we 
to get it back without exciting 
unwelcome attention?" 

"Frankly," said Zolto, "1 don't 
know. But we'd better think of 
a way. He must have mistaken 
it for a nut and swallowed it. Undoubtedly the hospital attendants 
will take X-rays of him and discover it." 

"They won't know what it is.** 
"They will operate to remove 
it. and then they will find out." 

Pojim nodded. "What 1 don't 
understand," she said, "is why 
it had this effect. When we lost 
it. it was locked." 

"He must have opened it by 
accident. Some of these creatures. 
I have noticed, have a habit of 
trying to crack nuts with their 
teeth. He must have bitten on the 
proper switch." 

"The one for inanimate matter? 1 think. Zolto, that you're

right. The stomach contents are 
collapsed and passed into our 
universe through the transfer. 
But the stomach itself, being part 
of a living creature, cannot pass 
through the same switch. And the 
poor creature continually loses 
weight because of metabolism. 
Especially, of course, when he 
eats." 

"Poor creature, you call him? 
You're too soft-hearted, Pojim. 
What do you think we'll be if we 
don't get the transfer back?" 

He hunched up his shoulders 
and laughed. 

Pojim said. "Control yourself, 
Zolto. When you laugh, you don't 
look human, and you certainly 
don't sound il ." 

"What difference does it make? 
We're alone." 

"You can never tell when we'll 
be overheard." 

"Don't change the subject. 
What are we supposed to do 
about the transfer?" 

"We'll think of a way," said 
Pojim, but he could see she was 
worried. 

IN the hospital, they had put 
Ollie into a bed. They bad 
wanted a nurse to bathe him, 
hut he had objected violently fco 
this indignity, and finally they 
had sent in a male orderly to do 
the job. Now. bathed, shaven and 
wearing a silly little nightgown

at himself, he was lying in bed. 

slowly starving to death. 

A dozen empty plates, the remains of assorted specialties of 
the hospital, filled with vitamins 
and other good things, lay around 
him. Everything had tasted fine 
while going down, but nothing 
seemed to have stuck to him. 

All he could do was brood 
about the puzzled and anxious 
looks on the doctors' faces when 
they examined him. 

The attack came without warning. One moment Ollie was lying 
there unhappily, suffering hunger 
pangs, and the next moment 
somebody had punched him in 
the stomach. The shock made 
him start and ttien look down. 
But there was nobody near him. 
The doctors had left him alone 
while they looked up articles in 
textbooks and argued with each 
other. 

He felt another punch, and 
then another and another. He 
yelled in fright and pain. 

After five minutes, a nurse 
looked in and asked casually, 
"Did you call?" 

"My stomach!" groaned OUie. 
"Somebody's hittin* me in my 
stomach!" 

"It's a tummyache," she said 
with a cheerful smile. "It should 
teach you not to wolf your food." 

Then she caught a glimpse of 
his stomach, from which Olhc, in 
his agony, had cast off the sheet, 



SHIPPING CLfilK 



MS 



and she gulped. It was swollen 

like a watermelon — or, rather, 
like a watermelon with great 
warts. Lumps stuck out all over 
it. 

She rushed out, calling, "Doctor Iiunson! Doctor Manson!" 

When she returned with two 
doctors. Ollic was in such acute 
misery thai he didn't even notice 
them. One doctor said, "Well, I'll 
be damned!" and began tapping 
the swollen stomach. 

The other doctor demanded, 
"When did this happen?" 

"Right now. I guess," replied 
the nurse. "Just a few minutes 
•aejo his stomach was as flat as 
the wuy it was when you saw it." 

"We'd better give him a shot 
of morphine to put him out of 
his pain," said the first doctor, 
"arid then we'll X-ray him." 

Ollic was in a semi-coma as 
thty lifted him off his bed and 
wheeled him into the X-ray 
room. He didn't hear a word of 
the ensuing discussion about the 
photographs, although the doctors talked freely in front of him 
— freely and profanely. 

It was Dr. Manson who demanded, "What in God's name 
are those things, anyway?" 

"They look like pineapples and 
gMpefruit," replied the bewildered X-ray specialist. 

"Square -edged pineapples? 
Grapefruit with one end 
pointed?" . . 



"I didn't say that's what they 
an.," returned the other defensively. "I said that's what they 
look like. The grapefruit could 
be eggplant," he added in confusion. 

"Eggplant, my foot. How the 
devil did they get into his stomach, anyway? He's been eating 
like a pig. but even a pig couldn't 
have gotten those things down 
its throat." 

"Wake him up and ask him.** 

"He doesn't know any more 
than we do," said the nurse. "He 
told me that it felt as if somebody was hitting him in the 
stomach. That's all he'd be able 
to tell us." 

"He's got the damnedest stomach I ever heard of," marveled 
Dr. Manson. "Let's open it up 
and take a look at it from the 
inside." 

"We'll have to get his consent, 
said the specialist nervously. "I 
know it would be interesting, but 
we can't cut into him unless he's 
willing." 

"It would be for his own good. 
We'd get that unsliced fruit salad 
out of him." Dr. Manson stared 
at the X-ray plates again. "Pineapples, grapefruit, something that 
looks like a banana with a small 
bush on top. Assorted large round 
objects. And what looks like a 
nut. A small nut." 

If Ollie had been aware, he 
might have told Dr. Manson that 




 



the nut was the kernel of the 
trouble. As it was, all he could 
do was groan. 

"He's coming to," said the 
nurse. 

"Good," asserted Dr. Manson. 
"Get a release, Nurse, and the 
minute he's capable of following 
directions, have him sign it." 

TN the corridor outside, two 
white-clad interns stopped at 
the door of OUie's room and 
listened. They could not properly 
have been described as man and 
woman, but at any rate one was 
male and the other female. If 
you didn't look at them too 
closely, they seemed to be human, which, of course, was what 
they wanted you to think. » 

"Just as I said," observed 
Zolto. "They intend to operate. 
And their attention has already 
been drawn to the nut." 

"We can stop them by violence, 
if necessary. But I abhor violence." 

"I know, dear," Zolto said 
thoughtfully. "What has happened is clear enough. He kept 
sending all that food through, 
and our people analyzed it and 
discovered what it was. They 
must have been surprised to discover no message from us, but 
after a while they arrived at the 
conclusion that we needed some 
of our own food and they sent it 
to us. It's a good thing that they 



didn't send more of it at one 
time." 

"The poor man must be in 
agony as it is." 

"Never mind the poor man. 
Think of our own situation." 

"But don't you see, Zolto? His 
digestive juices can't dissolve 
such unfamiliar chemical constituents, and his stomach must 
be greatly irritated." 

She broke off for a moment as 
the nurse came past them, giving 
them only a casual glance. The 
X-ray specialist followed shortly, 
his face reflecting the bewilderment he felt as a result of studying the plate he was holding. 

"That leaves only Dr. Manson 
with him," said Zolto. "Pojim, I 
have a plan. Do you have any 
of those pandigestive tablets with 
you?" 

"I always carry them. I never 
know when in this world I'll run 
into something my stomach can't 
handle." 

"Fine." Zolto stepped back 
from the doorway, cleared his 
throat, and began to yell, "Calling Dr. Manson! Dr. Manson, 
report to surgery!" 

"You've been seeing too many 
of their movies," said Pojim. 

But Zolto's trick worked. They 
heard Dr. Manson mutter, 
"Damn!" and saw him rush into 
the corridor. He passed them 
without even noticing that they 
were there.

**We have him to ourselves," 
said Zolto. "Quick, the tablets." 

They stepped into the room, 
where Zolto passed a small inhalator back and forth under 
Ollie's nose. Ollie jerked away 
from it, and his eyes opened. 

"Take this," said Pojim, with 
a persuasive senile. "It will ease 
your pain." And she put two 
tablets into Ollie's surprised 
mouth. 

Automatically, Ollie swallowed 
and the tablets sped down to 
meet the collection in his stomach. Pojim gave him another 
smile, and then she and Zolto 
were out of the room. , 

To Ollie, things seemed to be 
happening in more and more bewildering fashion. No sooner had 
these strange doctors left than 
Dr. Manson came rushing back, 
cursing, in a way that would 
have shocked Hippocrates, the 
unknown idiot who had summoned him to surgery. Then the 
nurse came in, with a paper. Ollie 
gathered that he was being asked 
to sign something. 

He shook his head vigorously. 
"Not me. I don't sign nothiri, 
sister.** 

"It's a matter of life and death. 
Your own life and death. We 
have to get those things out of 
your stomach." 

"No, sir, you're not cuttin 1 me 
open." 

Dr. Manson gritted his teeth 



in frustration. "You don't feel so 
much pain now because of the 
morphine I gave you. But it's 
going to wear off in a few minutes and then you'll be in agony 
again. You'll have to let us operate." 

"No, sir," repeated Olltt" stubbornly. -You're not cuttin' me 
open." 

And then he almost leaped 
from his bed. His already distended stomach seemed to swell 
outward, and before the astonished eyes of doctor and nurse, a 
strange new bump appeared. 

"Help!" yelled Ollie. 

"That's exactly what we're trying to do," said Dr. Manson 
angrily. "Only you won't let us. 
Now sign that paper, man, and 
stop your nonsense." 

Ollie groaned and signed. The 
next moment he was being rushed 
into the operating room. 

HpHE morphine was wearing off 
rapidly, and he lay, still 
groaning, on the table. From the 
ceiling, bright lights beat down 
upon him. Near his head the 
anesthetist stood with his cone 
of sleep poised in readiness. At 
one side a happy Dr. Manson 
was slipping rubber gloves on his 
antiseptic hands, while the at' 
tentive nurses and assistants 
waited. 

Two interns were standing near 
the doorway. One of them, Zolto, 



118 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



said softly, "We may have to use 
violence after all. They must not 
find it." 

"I should have given him a 
third tablet," said Pojim, the 
other intern, regretfully. "Who 
would have suspected that the 
action would be so slow?" 

They fell silent. Zolto slipped 
s hand into his pocket and 
grasped the weapon, the one He 
had hoped he wouldn't have to 
use. 

Dr. Manson nodded curtly and 
said, "Anesthetic." 

And then, as the anesthetist 
bent forward, it happened. Ollie's 
uncovered stomach, lying there in 
wait for the knife, seemed to 
heave and boil. Ollie shrieked 
and, as the assembled medicos 
watched in dazed fascination, the 
knobs and bumps smoothed out. 
The whole stomach began to 
shrink, like a cake falling in 
when some one has slammed the 
oven door. The pandigestive tablets had finally acted. 

Ollie sat up. He forgot that he 
was wearing the skimpy and 
shameless nightgown, forgot, too, 
that he had a roomful of spectators. He pushed away the anesthetist who tried to stop him. 

"I feel fine," he said. 

"Lie down," ordered Dr. Manson sternly. "We're going to operate and find out what's wrong 
with you." 

"You're not cuttin* into me," 
•aid Ollie. He swung his feet to 



the floor and stood up. "There 
ain't nothin' wrong with me. I 
feel wonderful. For the first time 
in my life I ain't hungry, and I'm 
spoilin' for trouble. Don't nobody 
try to stop me." 

He started to march across the 
floor, pushing his way through 
the protesting doctors. 

"This way," said one of ■ the 
interns near the door. "We'll get 
your clothes." Ollie looked at her 
in suspicion, but she went on, 
' ' R emem ber ? I'm the one who 
gave you the tablets to make the 
pain go away." 

"They sure worked," said Ollie 
happily, and allowed himself to 
be led along. 

He heard the uproar behind 
him, but he paid no attention. 
Whatever they wanted, he was 
getting out of here, fast. There 
might have been trouble, but at 
a critical point the public address system swung into operation, thanks to the foresight of his 
intern friends, who had rigged up 
a special portable attachment to 
the microphone. It started calling 
Dr. Manson, calling Dr. Kolanyi, 
calling Dr. Pumber, and all the 
others. 

In the confusion, Ollie escaped 
and found himself, for the first 
time in his life, a passenger in a 
taxicab. With him were the two 
friendly interns, no longer in 
white. 

"Just in case any more of those 
lumps appear in your stomach," 



130 



GALAXY SCI I NCI FICTION 



said the female, "you'd better 
take another couple of tablets." 

She was so persuasive that 
Olile put up only token resistance. The tablets went down his 
stomach, and then he settled 
back to enjoy the cab ride. It 
was only later that he wondered 
where they were taking him. By 
that time, he was too sleepy to 
wonder very much. 

With the aid of the first two 
tablets, he had digested the 
equivalent of a tremendous meal. 
The blood coursed merrily in his 
veins and arteries, and he had a 
warm sensation of well-being. 

As the taxi sped along, his eyes 
closed. 

"Y"OU transmitted the message 
in one of the latter tablets?" 
asked Zolto in their native 
tongue. 

"I have explained all that has 
happened," replied his wife. 
"They will stop sending food and 
wait for other directives." 

"Good. Now we'll have to get 
the transfer out of him as soon 
as possible. We ourselves can operate and he will never be the 
wiser." 

"I wonder," said Pojim. "Once 
we have the transfer, it will only 
be a nuisance to us. We'll have 
to guard it carefully and be in 
continual fear of losing it. Perhaps it would be more sensible 
to leave it.inside him." , 

"Inside, hirn? Pojim, my sweet. 



have you taken leave of your 
senses?" 

"Not at all. It is easier to guard 
a man than a tiny object. I took 
a look at one of the X-ray plates, 
and it is clear that the transfer 
switch has adhered to his stomach. It will remain there indefinitely. Suppose we focus a transpositor on that stomach of his. 
Then, as the objects we want arrive from our own universe in 
their collapsed condition, we can 
transpose them into our laboratory, enlarge them, and send 
them off to Aldebaran, where 
they are needed." 

"But suppose that he and that 
stomach of his move around!" 

"He will stay in one place if 
we treat him well. Don't you see, 
Zolto? He is a creature who has 
always lacked food. We shall 
supply him such food as his own 
kind have never dreamed of, 
complete with pandigestion fluid. 
At the same time, we shall set 
him to doing light work in order 
to keep him busy. Much of his 
task will involve studying and 
improving himself. And at night 
we shall receive the things we 
need from our own universe." 

"And when we have enough to 
supply the colony on Aldebaran 
II?" 

"Then it will be time enough to 
remove the transfer switch." 

Zolto laughed. It was a laugh 
that would have been curiously 
out of place in a human being, 



SH I P P I N G CLERK 



and if the taxi driver hadn't been 
so busy steering his way through 
traffic, he would have turned 
around to look. Pojim sensed the 
danger, and held up a warning 
finger. 

Zolto subsided. "You have remarkable ideas, my wife. Still, I 
see no reason why this should 
not work. Let us try it." 

OLLIE awoke to a new life. He 
was feeling better than he 
had ever felt in his entire misera1 1< existence. The two interns 
who had come along with him 
had been transformed magically 
into a kindly lady and gentleman, who wished to hire him to 
do easy work at an excellent salary. Ollie let himself be hired. 

He had his choice of things to 
rat now, but. strangely enough, 
he no longer had his old hunger. 
It was as if he were being fed 
from some hidden source, and he 
ate, one might almost have said, 
for the looks of it. The little he 
did consume, however, seemed to 
go a long way. 

He gained weight, his muscles 
hardened, his old teeth fell out 
end new ones appeared. He himself was astonished at this latter 
phenomenon, but after his previous experience at the hospital, he 
kept his astonishment to himself. 
The spots on his lungs disappeared, his spine straightened. 
After a time he reached a weight 
of a hundred and ninety pounds, 



and his eyes were bright and 
clear. At night he slept the sleep 
of the just — or the drugged. 

At first he was happy. But 
after several months, there came 
a feeling of boredom. He sought 
out Mr. and Mrs. Zolto, and said, 
"I'm sorry, I can't stay here any 
longer." 

"Why?" asked the lady. 

"There's no room here, ma'am, 
for advancement," he said, almost apologetically. "I've been 
studyin' and I got ideas about 
things I can do. All sorts of 
ideas." 

Pojim and Zolto, who had 
planted the ideas, nodded solemnly. 

Pojim said, "We're glad to hear 
that, Ollie. The fact is that we 
ourselves had decided to move 
to — to a warmer climate, some 
distance away from here. We 
wer,e wondering how you'd get 
along without us." 

"Don't you worry about me. 
I'll do fine." 

"Well, that's splendid. But it 
would be convenient to us if you 
could wait till tomorrow. We'd 
like to give you something to remember us by." 

"I'll be glad to wait, ma'am." 

That night Ollie had a strange 
nightmare. He dreamed that he 
was on the operating table again, 
and that the doctors and nurses 
were once more closing in on him. 
He opened his mouth to scream, 
but no sound came out. And then 



112 




 



the two interns were there, once 
more wearing their uniforms. 

The female said, "It's all right. 
It's perfectly all right. We're just 
removing the transfer switch. In 
the morning you won't even remember what happened." 

And. in fact, in the morning 
he didn't. He had only a vague 
feeling that something had happened. 

They shook hands with him 
and they gave him a very fine letter of reference, in case he tried 
to get another job, and Mrs. 
Zolto presented him with an envelope in which there were several bills whose size later made 
his eyes almost pop out of his 
head. 




He walked down the street as 
if it belonged to him, or were 
going to. Gone was the slouch, 
gone the bleariness of the eyes, 
gone the hangdog look. 

Gone was all memory of the 
dismal past. 

And then Ollie had a strange 
feeling. At first it seemed so peculiar that he couldn't figure out 
what it was. It started in his 
stomach, which seemed to turn 
over and almost tie itself into a 
knot. He felt a twinge of pain 
and winced almost perceptibly. 

It took him several minutes to 
realize what it was. 

For the first time in months, 
he was hungry.

IT looks as though 1952 is going to be the Year of Anthologies — as if 1951 already hadn't 
been one. As of March, when this 
was written, a dozen collections 
have either appeared or been announced for Spring 1952 — of 
which the present one is among 
the best. This is only what one 
might expect, knowing Heinlein's 
own mature tastes. 

There are 8 A stories in the 
book out of a total of 14. The 
balance are all Bs — there is noth


ing poorer than B — . This is 
hot shooting when you remember 
that none of the tales has ever 
been anthologized before. 

The "A" items — "I'm Scared" 
by Jack Finney (superb time 
story). "The Silly Season" by C. 
M. Kornbluth (chilling), "The 
Report on the Barnhouse Effect" 
by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. (magnificent parapsychological tale), 
"Absalom" by Henry Kuttner 
(the mutant children) , "Betelgeuse Bridge" by William Tenn 
(ironical). "Keyhole" by Murray 
Leinster (I loved this one!), "Misbegotten Missionary" by Isaac 
Asimov (a beauty), and — best 
story in the book in many ways

■ — "Poor Superman" by Fritz 
Leiber (better known to GALLAXY readers as "Appointment 
in Tomorrow"). 

B — "Tourist Trade" by Bob 
Tucker, "Rainmaker" by John 
Reese, "The Monster" by Lester 
del Rey. "Jay Score" by Eric 
Frank Russell (a semi-classic) , 
"The Sack" by William Morrison, 
and "Survival Ship" by Judith 
Merril.

THE ASTOUNDING SCIENCE 
FICTION ANTHOLOGY. Edited by John W. Campbell, Jr. 
Simon & Schuster, Inc., New 
York, 1952. 583 pages, $3,95 

fT^HIS distinctively pergonal selection, by the Grand Old Man 
of science fiction editing, is a 
good indication of the historymaking qualities of the magazine 
that has been his lifework. It contains 23 stories, of which 15 are 
A or better, and only 3 are C— 
and John Campbell's A stories 
are among the finest that science 
fiction has turned out. 

Witness : Heinlein's "Blowups 
Happen," Asimov's "Nightfall," 
Padgett's "When the Bough 
Breaks," O'Donnell's "Clash by 
Night," Leinster's "First Contact," Dolton Edwards' very odd 
and non-fictional "Meihem in Ce 
Klasrum," Sherred's "E for Ef


fort" Tenn's "Child's Play," 
Sturgeon's "Thunder and Roses," 
Erie Russell's "Late Night Final," Kris Neville's "Cold War," 
Simak's "Eternity Lost," 
SchmiU's "The Witches of 
Karre," del Rey's "Over the 
Top," and Fyfe's "Protected 
Species" — any editor has a right 
to be proud of such a group of 
tales from his own magazine, 
There is only one thing wrong, 
and that is the editor's modesty. 
He included no story by himself 
— which leaves an empty spot 
right in the middle of the book. 

But speaking of modesty, I am 
reluctantly guilty of it myself, 
for the next item is a guest review 
by Villiers Gerson of the New 
York Times and lots of other 
places: 

INVADERS OF EARTH. Edited by Groff ConkHn. Vanguard 
Press, New York, 1952. xiii plus 
333 pa^es, $2.95 

j^ROFF CONKLIN'S newest 
anthology, whose theme, as its 
title suggests, is the invasion of 
Earth by everything from BEMs 
(although these are kept to a 
minimum) to energy forms, is an 
excellent collection of 22 tales, 
only one of which has ever been 
published between hard covers 
before. That one is Howard 
Koch's famous 1938 radio script 
for Orson Welles, "Invasion from 



★ ★ ★ * * SHELF

Mars," and it is certainly worthy 
of inclusion. Also included is a 
particularly notable "first," the 
initial appearance in English of 
Karl Grunert's 1907 story. "Enemies in Space," translated from 
the German by Willy Ley especially for this anthology. 

This reviewer's favorites were 
Edgar Pangborn's "Angel's Egg," 
Ted Sturgeon's "Tiny and the 
Monster," and Fredric Brown's 
"The Waveries." In fact, although horror and menace are 
well represented, the existence of 
an up-beat in a great many of the 
stories gives the book a strong — 
and welcome — tone of affirmation.

JACK OF EAGLES, by James 
Blish. Greenberg: Publisher, New 
York, 1952. 246 pages, $2.75 

HERE'S a queer one. James 
Blish's first novel deals with 
parapsychology, and therefore, 
according to the modern, smart, 
fashionable logical positivists who 
today rule much scientific thinking, it must be called fantasy, a 
fairy tale. 

On the other hand, Blish uses 
some of the very latest scientific 
ideas of outstanding men such as 
Heisenberg, B 1 a c k e 1 1 , Dirac, 
Planck, and many other Big 
Names, to give a queerly logical 
realism to his tale of Danny 



Caiden's struggle to develop his 
astonishing parapsy etiological 
powers. You may well leave the 
book considerably less skeptical 
about "the occult" (or parts of 
it) than you were when you 
started it. 

The story is located in New 
York. Danny starts off as a smalltime journalist; but before long 
his original talents have become 
literally useless, and his new 
ones have gotten him into hot 
water with the F.B.I., in contact with the true world of psimen, and in love with Maria, a 
provocative shill for a fake medium, who latches on to Danny 
on the theory that he must be a 
more successful fake than her 
previous boss. She changes this 
opinion, however, discovering 
eventually that she, too, has some 
parapsychological powers — and 
ethics. 

Blish's writing is good, though 
not distinguished; his approach 
to the world of ideas is positive 
and constructive; and his ability 
to interweave exciting story and 
abstruse scientific explanation is 
remarkable. Jack of Eagles is a 
real accomplishment. 

Approach it with an open mind, 
refuse to let your conventional 
disbeliefs in parapsychological 
matters get in your way, and you 
will have a very pleasant time 
reading it.

Ninety-second Day 

YOU get yourself stuck off 
on a rock in space and 
after a while you begin to 
go nuts. Naturally. That's why 
Sam Black upset the chess board 



halfway through a game he certainly had not been losing to Ales 
Hurd. 

''Sorry, Alex," he said immediately, looking disgusted with 
himself. He picked the pieces 



THE HOAXTERS 



I33> 



from the floor of the research station's day room. 

" You've been out here too 
long," said Alex, putting the 
chessmen in their box. 

"Yeah," Sam agreed. "It's not 
the company — it's the year between supply ships. We're compatible enough; our pre-tests ran 
enough alike for us to have been 
twins, almost. But I get damned 
tired of seeing nothing but your 
ugly face and those four laboratory walls," 

"And the rolling pin," added 
Alex, whose pleasant face was 
long and high-boned, with a carefully tended mustache. "Rolling 
that hunk of steel over the rock 
specimens day after day. I've 
never really been convinced that 
it can't be done electrically, in a 
crusher. I think they want us to 
do it by hand so we'll earn our 
pay, maybe also to keep us too 
busy to think." 

"It's the hand and the eye, 
Alex. The hand is slower than the 
eye, no matter what magicians 
say. and we could spot the particles. If we mashed everything up 
in a crusher, the stuff we're after 
would get sluiced away with the 
rock powder and we'd never see 
it." 

"Assuming it's there to be 
seen." 

"They wouldn't have sent us 
and our fat salaries out to this 
asteroid if there weren't a damn 



good possibility of finding the 
stuff. So I guess we'll just have to 
go on pounding." 

"And sneezing at the dust," 
added Alex. 

"And going nuts," said Sam. 

Ninety-ninth Day 
^pHEY weren't entirely alone on 
-■- the asteroid. There was a native form of sub-life that the first 
explorers had discovered. But it 
was mostly dormant and didn't 
live on the surface. It consisted 
of si ate -colored, unicellular hunks 
of stuff, as Alex described them, 
which moved around at point 
zero one miles per hour. They 
lived deep down in what either 
were natural tunnels or passageways they dug for themselves. 

They seemed to live on something in the rock; it was possible 
that they dug the tunnels not so 
much to travel where it was they 
wanted to go as to get nourishment. The hunks of stuff — they 
were about the size of a thumbnail — were so close in color to the 
rocks they lived in, and on, that 
they were nearly invisible. 

Sam and Alex had been told 
about them, that they were harmless, and had named them vizzies, 
for invisibles. They were as much 
company on their dull world as 
microbes on Earth. 

"Check," said Alex Hurd. It 
was the inevitable chess game. 

"You fell into the trap." said 




 



Sam Black, without enthusiasm. 
"Check yourself. I take the knight 
with my bishop and it's mate in 
two moves.** 

Alex studied the board and 
shrugged indifferently. "All right, 
you win. I'm getting careless. I'm 
tired. I want to go home. I want 
to see grass again, and trees. I 
hate rocks. I don't think we're 
doing anything important. I want 
to go back where the Sun comes 
up only once a day instead of 
every hour." 

"Home is alwayc »ice when 
you're somewhere else," Sam said, 
his brown eyes far away. "But I 
wonder if it's home we miss as 
much as activity. If only something would happen here, the 
place wouldn't be so hard to take. 
But nothing ever happens. We 
crush rock. We test particles. We 
find nothing. We crush more 
rock. We don't even know what 
they'll use the stuff foY if we ever 
find it. 

"We send out the rocket. It 
takes pictures and beeps its way 
around this dead old watermelon 
and the pictures never show anything and the beep tone never 
discovers anything we didn't 
know was there in the first place. 
If only something would happen 
■ — anything! I don't give a damn 
if it's good or bad, just so it happens." 

Sam had put the chess pieces 
away and now he made out their 



report to Base. The message went 
out once a day — once every Earth 
day, that was; not every monotonous time the oblong asteroid 
that wai their temporary world 
made a wobbly revolution on its 
axis. 

Sam's leathery jaw tightened 
in distaste as he punched out the 
daily report. It consisted of four 
words, which hadn't varied in the 
three months, Earth reckoning, 
that they'd been at the station. 

The words were: "AH well. 
Progress nil." 

It was the "progress nil" which 
got them down as much as any 
of the other things, such as their 
work being so secret that they 
had no inkling of how their particular research fitted into the Big 
Picture. 

Their own work was the Little 
Picture, and it was a serial movie 
with interminable chapters. It 
was at this point in the dull 
drama that they began to wonder if they'd ever see the final 
installment, or whether they'd 
hand over their rock rollers to 
their successors at the end of 
their hitch without ever having 
known what it was all about. 

"Progress nil." If they had 
anything at all to report, or even 
if the wording were different so * 
k didn't sound so futile, their 
paid exile might have seemed less 
frustrating. 

"Let me have the report," said 



THE HOAXTERS 



129 



Alex. "I'm going to do something." 

"What, for instance?" 

"You'll see." 

Alex took the blank. He crossed 
out the word "nil" with an angry 
motion of his pen, scratched his 
mustache reflectively, and then 
wrote busily for a minute. He 
handed the sheet back to Sam. 

It now read: 

"All well. Progress . . . Break 
for urgent. S.O.S. Research Station Nineteen. Attack on station 
by alien life-form from coordinates zero four eight x two 
seven. Request patrol craft blast 
spot as own armament ineffectual." 

Sam read the message. "You're 
nuts," he said. 

"I know it. Nuts from the monotony. Something's got to give 
and I don't want it to be me or 
you. We need a little excitement; 
you said so yourself." 

"I was only talking. A gripe 
is a gripe, but sending out a false 
alarm — " He crumpled the message and tossed it away. 

"Don't do that." Alex picked 
it up and smoothed it out. "We'll 
make it plausible. We'll blow up 
a couple of pieces of old junk 
near the station and send a few 
shells over. Set the stage, you 
know. The patrol will come and 
blast away and then the crew will 
come in and talk about it and 
we'll have a good story for them 



and they'll stick around a while 
and we'll have new faces for a 
change and — " 

Sam got up and paced around 
the small room. His serious face 
was pulled into a frown. 

"We can't do it, Alex. It 
wouldn't be right. They'd find 
out it was a fake and we'd be 
kicked out in disgrace. What kind 
of menace could we whip up that 
would fool them? Not that we're 
going to, but just for argument's 
sake." He grinned, his eyes lighting with interest for once. "At 
least we can talk about it. It's 
better than chess." 

"Good man," said Alex. "Of 
course, we won't do it if you don't 
think we can get away with it, 
or," he added hurriedly, "if you 
don't think it's right, Sam. But 
here's the way it could be. We 
could make the menace a stray 
explorer ship from Jupiter. Got 
off course, say, and landed here, 
thinking this was one of the 
asteroids in its own protectorate, 
instead of Earth's or Mars*. Mistaken identity, see? We send a 
message telling them to get off. 
Maybe the message is a little hot 
under the collar and they take 
offense — sling a shot at us. We 
fire back. Then they start shooting in earnest. We send the S.O.S. 
The patrol ship sends out one of 
its oblivion bombs. The patrol 
can't see the target, but it has the 
coordinates we gave them, and. 



130 




 



of course, after the explosion 
there's nothing left of the explorer from Jupiter." 

"It stinks," Sam grunted in disgust. "If that's the way your 
mind works, no wonder you're 
such a dud at chess. Look, we've 
got to work with what we have. 
You can't queen a pawn till you 
get it in the back row. No pirate 
ships or interplanetary monsters 
or any such baloney. We'll use 
the vizzies. All of a sudden, see, 
they come up out of the ground. 
It's a periodic migration or something of the sort; you know, like 
the birds going South, only not 
so often. They stop being just 
little hunks of stuff and join up 
into a real, plausible menace. Get 
it?" 

"Yeah," Alex replied, dazzled. 
"That's better than my idea any 
day." 

Hundredth Day 
rpHEY had sent out the fake 
distress signal, in a revised 
version, after twenty-four hours 
of preparation. 

"I must be crazy," said Sam. 
"How did I ever let you talk me 
into this ridiculous situation? 
Let's cancel it — say we were 
drunk or delirious." 

"We can't back out now, Sam.** 
Alex's eyes were alive with excitement. "Look, here comes an 
answer now. We're in business." 

Sam read it. "The patrol craft. 



Coming at full speed from — 
God, it's a long way off! I hope 
the vizzies don't get us first." 

"That's the spirit!" cried Alex. 
"Put yourself in the frame of 
mind and we'll be all right. Just 
picture it — the vizzies massed in 
tight Z formation, eating everything in their path, moving inexorably in our direction, as if 
they scent and resent us. The 
suspense is terrible. Will the patrol craft get here in time? Will 
the oblivion bomb have any effect? Will the brave researchers 
survive the creeping horde or will 
help arrive too late and find only 
human bones picked clean? Or 
will the bones, too, be consumed? 
Isn't it terrific? I feel like a kid 
at a football game again." 

"But you look like a mad 
scientist." Sam was smiling now, 
caught up in Alex's infectious enthusiasm. His broad face was 
aglow. "Maybe you are crazy." 

"Sure I'm crazy. So are you. 
But it's only temporary. This'll 
jjut us back on keel and we'll be 
able to stand it again for a while." 

"Wait a minute," Sam said. 
"We forgot something. If the vizzies were attacking, wouldn't we 
have the photo rocket out taking 
pictures? The investigators are 
going to want to see the films." 

"You're right," agreed Alex. 
"And we will show them a film, 
only they won't see a thing — just 
the landscape under infra-red. 



THE HOAXTERS 



131 



The vizzies are invisible. Right? 
Well, they blend so well with the 
slate that no one could see them 
from that altitude. And I've 
faked some beeps on the electronic probe, so we're safe there, 
too." 

Another message came from 
the patrol craft. It had streaked 
a vast distance since its last communication and was urging the 
men on the asteroid to hold on 
if they could. 

Sam radioed back that time 
seemed to be favoring the defenders. They had lobbed a few 
shells, he said, but the old-fashioned explosives were having no 
effect. The vizzies were moving 
so slowly, however, that it would 
be several hours before they 
could reach the station. At Alex's 
suggestion, he explained that they 
were plotting the vizzies" position 
electronically and repeated the 
coordinates they had given earlier. 

Half an hour later, the patrol 
craft hove into missile range, although not into sight, and advised that it was ready to launch 
a rocket with an oblivion-bomb 
warhead. The hoaxters on the 
asteroid corrected the coordinates 
to move the mythical horde a 
few yards nearer the research station; then they radioed that it 
was okay to fire. 

The station shuddered and 
rocked on its deep foundations 



as the o-bomb exploded nearly 
twenty miles away. The plotters 
sent out the photo rocket to take 
pictures. It came back with a 
him that showed an o-bomb 
crater a quarter of a mile across 
and a collection of beep tones 
that recorded a lot of radioactivity, but no vizzies. 

Soon afterward, the patrol 
craft streaked across the starfilled sky and radioed for permission to land. 

"Break out the clean tablecloth !" said Alex. "Company's 
coming!'* 

Hundred and First Day 
" T\0 you think they suspect 
anything?" asked Sam. 
"They turn up their noses at our 
accommodations, they bunk and 
eat in their own ship, they roam 
around the rock as thick as berrypickers and they ask more questions than a five-year-old." 

"It's routine," said Alex unworriedly. "They have to make a 
report. Be thankful we don't have 
to. The skipper said we could 
have a copy of theirs to send on. 
to Base. Have you run into any 
of the re porters ? That's wh ere 
we'll have to watch our step." 

"I saw the press rocket land, 
but nobody's been around yet.** 

The buzzer sounded. A lean, 
tow-headed young man came in 
through the airlock, took off his 
gear and introduced himself as 



193 




 



Kirsten of Galactic News. 

"Gentlemen," he said, "I assume you are the outcasts. Two 
of the far-flung researchers of 
the Exploration and Assessment 
Commission. If you are, and you 
must be, I greet you cordially 
and invite you to share with mc 
this precious bottle. I offer it in 
the knowledge that if I were you, 
and if I had been here three 
months, I'd have drunk up every 
drop I npght have brought with 
me against the possibility of 
snake-bite — or, in this particular 
case, vizzie-bite. Do I hear anyone decline?" 

"You hear nothing of the sort," 
said Alex. "What you hear is me 
getting three glasses. I'm Alex 
Hurd; this is Sam Black." 

"Delighted, gentlemen," said 
Kirsten. "The beauty of vizziebite, as I understand it, is {hat 
the critter can't be seen with the 
naked eye and that you are therefore unable to be absolutely certain whether you have received 
the mortal sting. And so you go 
to the medicinal licker — I beg 
your pardon, locker — according 
to schedule, as a precaution 
against the dread possibility of 
being a vizzie victim. Am I correct?" 

"Do you always talk this 
way?" asked Sam. 

"I talk the way I write, and 1 
am a feature writer," said Kirsten. "For the other fellow, the 



dross of cold fact, the colorless 
statistic ; for me. the del k ate 
fabric of embroidery, the phrase 
which recreates the scene in vivid 
life, the sentence which tugs at 
the heartstring and calls forth the 
tear, or evokes the smile of true 
understanding." 

"Yeah, you do that, all right,** 
Alex admitted. 

The reporter sat down and 
poured three drinks from a halffull bottle. 

"I have already been at it,*" 
said Kirsten, "as y6u will observe. I drink; it is my curse and 
my sorrow. But it is also my need 
and my joy. My editor often has 
said to me, 'Randy, you are one 
of the few who give the press 
corps a bad name. You are a 
lush. Randy, and your habit undoes the good impression madeby the majority of the men of 
the press, who arc sober men and 
faithful to their wives. But you 
are a writer. Randy, who has a 
way with words,' said my editor, 
'and the way you have is such 
that you would be snapped up 
instanter by the opposition if I 
fired you, and that is why I have 
refrained from giving you the 
sack.' This is more or less what 
my editor often has said to me, 
and I repeat it to you by way of 
explanation should you think me 
unduly casual concerning what 
conceivably was a marrow-chilling experience." 



THE HOAXTERS 



Sam and Alex left their drinks 
untasted as they listened in admiration. 

"This is as good as a floor 
show," said Alex. 

"Better," said the reporter, unperturbed. "And there's absolutely no charge. Now, would 
one of you be so good as to describe your sensations for my 
stenographic ear? I will take no 
notes, but the polished substance 
of what you relate soon will be 
broadcast throughout the Solar 
System." 

Kirsten tilted his chair back 
and looked expectantly from one 
to the other with his alert eyes. 

They drank and talked. Alex 
carried the burden of the conversation for the pair, although 
Sam occasionally put in a word 
of further explanation. He also 
gave Alex a kick once or twice 
when he thought his partner was 
embroidering the fabric of their 
yarn too much, instead of letting 
Kirsten devise his own ways to 
tug at the heartstring. 

They had barely killed the bottle when other reporters arrived. 
They dropped their gear on the 
floor and took out pocket-size 
stenotypers. Alex repeated their 
story for the latecomers' benefit 
and some fresh bottles were 
opened up. At intervals, reporters 
went out to file stories. Kirsten 
among them. But they came back 
and, their work finished, settled 



down to have a party. 

Crew members from the patrol 
ship joined the festivities in the 
researchers' dayroom, but the 
skipper remained aloof. 

**Chess, anyone?" asked Alex, 
but it was a deck of cards he 
produced. 

They played poker, drank, told 
stories and sang space ballads 
until the skipper came in to get 
Alex's and Sam's signatures on a 
statement and announce that his 
ship would be leaving in an hour. 

The mission was completed. 
The skipper and the head of his 
investigation unit apparently 
were satisfied that the vizzie menace was ended. 

The reporters had asked some 
astute questions, considering that 
they were laymen, but the plotters saw no hint of suspicion anywhere. They were jubilant. Their 
hoax had been a terrific success. 
They'd had their excitement. 
They'd had a lot of flattering 
attention. And they'd had a 
party. 

Hundred and Forty-third Day 




LEX said : "Let's have a 
party." 



"What?" said Sam. He was 
trimming a beard he had started 
to grow six weeks earlier. 

"A party," repeated Alex. "I'm 
getting bored again. 1 think it's 
time for another vizzie menace." 

"Nothing doing." 



134 




 



M Aw, please, Sam." 

"No." He snipped carefully at 
the short whiskers. 

**■ 'No' or 'not yet'?" asked Alex. 

"No," said Sam firmly. But 
then he added : "Well, not yet." 

Hundred and Seventy-sixth Day 
"V7"OU know," said Alex wistfully, "that was awfully good 
liquor Kirsten had." 

"Who?" Sam's beard was quite 
full now. He combed it luxuriously. 

"Kirsten, the reporter, that 
time we hoaxed them. Let's hoax 
them again, Sam. I could sure 
use some poker. I think if I play 
another game of chess, with you 
pulling away at that damn beaver 
you've worked up. I'll really go 
nuts. I feel like a pawn of fate, 
cast out into the void, left to be 
advanced one square at a time to 
my doom of ennui." 

"Doom of what?" asked Sam, 
halting the comb. 

"Ennui. Boredom." 

"Just because you liked Kirsten's liquor, you don't have to 
start talking like him." 

"I have a feeling I'm going to 
sound a, lot worse pretty soon, if 
something doesn't happen. Then 
you'll be cooped up on this piece 
of nothing with a raving lunatic 
— maybe one with a beard phobia. You'll have to lock me up 
and roll all those rocks by yourself, and it'll take you twice as 



long to get no place with this 
damn fool research as it doe* 
now. Sam, let's have a party. 
Let's make the vizzies march." 
Sam said : "Well . . " 

Hundred and Eightieth Day] 
rpHE little spaceport on the 
asteroid was chockful of official craft. The patrol ship was 
there, an all-white vessel from 
World Government, two press 
ships this time, and a cumbersome-looking craft with cranes 
poking out of it. 

The boys had cried wolf again, 
and this time they got more of a 
party than they had bargained 
for. The patrol ship had loosed 
another a- bomb. O- bombs were 
expensive. There was a second 
quarter-mile crater near the first 
and again there was no sign of a 
horde of vizzies. This was only 
natural, the hoaxters pointed out, 
because the o-bomb had obliterated them. But the skipper was 
not convinced. 

Not this time. 

He grilled Alex Hurd and Sam 
Black for two hours, then turned 
them over to his investigating officer, who grilled them some 
more. By then a World Government ship had arrived with a 
subcommissioner from the Exploration and Assessment Commission. The two researchers 
didn't dare back down now. and 
wearily they repeated their re

hearsed story once more. 

W. G. summoned an explorer 
ship and it came and poked its 
bores deep into the bowels of the 
asteroid. It lumbered here and 
there, as night and day chased 
themselves hourly around the 
tiny world, beeping electronically 
into the o-bomb craters, scooping up monstrous shovelfuls of 
ilatc and assaying them for signs 
of vizzies alive, vizzies dead, or 
vizzies disintegrated. 

Then the reporters were allowed to see the two men. They 
came without liquor this time, 
but with broad grins and clever 
remarks. Sam and Alex squirmed 
through the interview. They stuck 
to their story, trying to pretend 
they didn't hear the cracks about 
the Moon hoax and the Cardiff 
giant, and repeating again and 
again their invented description 
of how the vizzies had attacked 
in Z formation, until they grew 
utterly sick of the ridiculous 
word vi2zies — the reporters loved 
it — and their once-plausible 
story. 

Kirstcn was the worst of them. 
With his mock sympathy and 
his feigned seriousness, he almost 
trapped them a few times, but 
they wriggled out somehow. 

The reporters finally left them 
alone and they collapsed on their 
bunks. 

"Sam — " began Alex tentatively. 



"Shut up." said Sam. 

Kirsten dictated a story to Galactic News: 

"By Randy Kirstcn, Staff Correspondent. 

"There is some doubt today 
whether a tiny creature of primitive life, known to the trade as a 
vizzie (repeat vizzie, spelled 
v-i-doublc z-i-e), is as man-eating in its mealtime habits as two 
young scientists seem to fear. The 
native habitat of the vizzie is a 
forlorn asteroid somewhere beyond Mars which also is populated, temporarily, by the two 
young men. 

"Their job is a secret one. It is 
also dull, and it was with great 
excitement that they fell heir to 
what they described as an imminent vizzie invasion of their own 
little half-acre nearly three 
months ago. The space patrol 
nipped that vizzie menace in the 
bud, according to the record, on 
which doubt has now been cast. 

"But yesterday the alarm again 
went out from Asteroid X that 
the vizzies once more were on the 
march . , ." 

And so on. from Kirsten, for 
three thousand words. 

Hundred and Ninety-fifth Day 
"Vf/E shouldn't have used that 
part about the Z formation." said Alex Hurd. "That's 
what sounded silliest of all." 
"I've just succeeded in push


THE HOAXTERS 



ing the whole brainless stunt into 
my subconscious," S:iin Black 
said. "Til thank you to leave it 
there." 

"I didn't bring up the subject. 
Base did. This message just arrived." 

Sam took it. "Are wc fired?" 

"No. Just admonished. Pretty 
sarcastic, too, for an official document." 

The message, from their chief, 
pointed out the cost of two oblivion bombs, the cost of twice 
diverting a patrol ship from its 
normal course, the cost of sending an c x plor a t i on vessel to a 
remote asteroid which previously 
had been explored to everyone's 
satisfaction, the personal cost to 
him, the chief, in aggravation, 
and the cost to the Commission 
in prestige as a result of the sly 
news stories which had appeared 
after the second "problt "inatical" 
vizzie attack, as he termed it. 

It must be assumed, he went 
on, that there really was danger, 
inasmuch as there was no proof 
to the contrary. This assumption, 
hi said, must be the oflicuil vi rsion and, for its own sake, not 
theirs, the Commission must accept it and defend it wlu never 
the matter might be referred to 
in the future. 

But, the chief's message added, 
it was also true that there was no 
evidence to back up tire researchers* story and he privately felt 



that the vizzie menace was a 
myth. Any subsequent deviation 
from routine without factual 
foundation, he warned, would be 
dealt with most harshly. 

"Kile it," said Sam. "File it 
and remember it." 

Two Hundred and Seventeenth 
Day 

"HpHE rocket's back," announced Sain. 

"Let's skip it this time. Watching tli3t film always puts me to 
sleep, anyway." 

"Come on. It's got to be done." 

They got into their spacesuits 
and went out to the landing rack 
to see how the rocket had made 
out this time. 

"Missed again," said Alex. "I'll 
git the tractor." 

He lumbered out to the rocket 
in the lialf-track and hauled it 
back. He took out the film pack 
and th< y went indoors to run it 
on the projector. 

"Let it roll," said Alex. "I'm 
ready to hiss the villain." 

The projector reeled off the 
routine circumnavigation of the 
asteroid as it would have appeared to a pilot if there had 
been one aboard the guided 
rocket. It was dull, as usual, 
watching the unending vista of 
gray slate— punctuated now by 
two o-bomb craters — and listening to the accompanying electronic beeps. 



US 



CAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



But then, as the film was ending, the beep device went crazy. 
It began to chatter, to whine. 
Then it keened up into inaudibility. 

Alex, who had been curled in 
his seat, watching and listening 
automatically, shot upright. 

"Creeping beepers!" he shouted. 
"What's that?" 

Sam stopped the projector. 
Tensely, he spun it back a hundred feet and re-ran the film from 
there. 

As the beep tone began to chatter again, the film showed a flat 
plain which they recognized as 
being some miles west of them 
on the simulated compass. There 
was nothing visible on the plain — not from the height at which the 
photo rocket had taken the pictures — but the chatter became a 
whine as the flat land sped by. 

The beep tone began keening 
as the craft sped toward a sheer 
cliff. The cliff was the edge of a 
plateau atop which the research 
station was built. The beep device went into its silence of supersound just before the rocket 
passed over the cliff. The normal 
beep tone then returned and continued until the landing, when 
the film ended. 

A magnification qf the film 
strip showed nothing. The ground 
which had been photographed 
was flat, rocky and devoid of 
even plant life. 



Working backward, the men 
found that the beep tone started 
acting up at the point where the 
film showed a small crater, not 
one of those made by the 
o-bombs. The crater had showed 
up on previous films, but it never 
seemed to mean anything except 
possibly that a meteor had struck 
there long ago. That was what it 
still looked like. 

"This is a job for Buster," Sam 
decided. 

Buster was their mechanical 
brain. He wasn't very bright, as 
such brains went, because there 
was no point in exiling one of the 
super-brains to a remote research 
station at a time when they were 
in great demand by Earth and 
the other developed planets. 

Buster was fed the film. He 
chewed on it for a while, getting 
it into its proper channel, swallowed it and then digested it to 
the accompaniment of clicks and 
burps. 

"Buster sure is a sloppy eater,'* 
Alex said, trying to cover up a 
case of nerves. "I hope this does 
not give him indigestion." 

After a while Buster disgorged 
the film, together with a printed 
Strip of paper. Sam grabbed it 
and compared the symbols on it 
with some "on a chart hanging 
from one of Buster's buttons. 

"I'll be damned!" 

"What is it, Sam?" 

"It's impossible. It couldn't 



THE HOAXTERS * A J ■ * 3 1 39 



happen. Not to us." 

"What, for God's sake?" 

"Buster says — this isn't fair! — 
he says the vizzies arc on the 
march." 

Alex looked at his bearded 
partner without comprehension. 
"I don't get it. What makes him 
think so?" 

"Buster doesn't think; he 
knows. You can work it back 
yourself. When those beeps 
turned into a whine, it meant 
something unusual. Even a kid 
knows that. Buster listened to the 
whine— or checked the impulses 
that caused the whine — and compared them with the impulses 
made by things we have records 
of. If he didn't know what they 
were, he would have said so. He 
didn't, which means he knows. He 
has a record of the impulse a 
vi2zie causes when a beep hits it. 
And he says the whine was' caused 
by a lot of vizzies, on the surisce. The whine got worse — more 
vizzies. Then it got supersonic. 
More vizzies than could be recorded at the threshold of sound, 
obviously." 

"It's impossible," Alex objected. 

"That's what I said. But I was 
wrong." 

"They're a hoax. They don't 
march. We made all that up. It 
was a gag!" 

"Well." said Sam. "it's, backfired on us." 



Two Hundred and Eighteenth 
Day 

THEY'D sent the rocket out 
again, switched to film and 
telecast so they would have a 
permanent record as well as an 
instantaneous picture of what 
was going on now. And they adjusted it for radar- telecast, now 
that they knew what they were 
looking for. One half of the screen 
showed them the scene under 
infra-red in the brief night — a 
desolate plain of cindery slate, 
ending at a cliff. Apparently 

nothing moved. 

But there on the other half of 
the screen, glowing in a mass that 
stretched along the base of the 
cliff and for as far back as could 
be seen, was an undulating sea of 
vizzies. 

"At least they're not in Z formation," Sam pointed out. 

"Ha, ha," said Alex in a flat 
voice. 

"Can you make out whether 
any of them are on the face of 
the cliff itself? Climbing up it?" 

"Wait till the rocket circles 
again. No, I can't tell. Can you 
see anything. Sam?" 

"Look! There goes a piece of 
the cliff. Crashing down as if — 
I'll bet that's it. Alex. They're 
eating away the base of the cliff. 
They cari'l go up it, so they're 
eating their way under it. Millions of , them— - billions!" 
, "Call , the patrol ship." said 




 



Alex. "At the rate they're going, 
they'll be here in a couple of 
days. There won't be any more 
plateau and our statio#*U go 
crashing down just like th« eliff." 

"Take it easy." suggested Sam. 
"The patrol ship wouldn't be 
anxious to come sec us a third 
time. Remember, we're the boys 
who cried wolf." 

"Sure, but there's the wolf! 
This time it's for real." 

"Real, yes," Sam told him. 
"But is it dangerous? We're still 
keyed up to that make-believe 
menace we created. I don't think 
we're being entirely logical about 
this situation." 

"Okay. Ten minutes out for 
logic. I vote for calling the ship 
and an o-bomb and taking our 
chances with their ridicule. But 
maybe you can make me change 
my mind." 

"This gives us a chance to get 
out of the doghouse. It couldn't 
be more perfect. If we can wrap 
up this situation ourselves, we'll 
be the fair-haired boys again, instead of a couple of rock-happy 
bats.** 

They dug into old records at 
the station. They measured the 
length and width of the vizzie 
horde and its depth. They found 
that the creatures were eating 
vertically into the surface of the 
plain as well as forward. They 
sent the photo-rocket out on a 
shuttle basis, set to both telecast 



and film. They peered at the 
video screen and examined the 
film. They satisfied themselves 
that the plateau, with its sheer 
cliffs, was a natural, if temporary, 
barrier to the horde. They computed the rate at which the 
plateau was being eaten away 
and found that they had a comfortable span of time in which to 
make preparations. 

Night gave way to day. 

From the old records they 
learned that the vizzies had never 
been run through a laboratory. 
The early explorers had satisfied 
themselves that the creatures 
were subterranean dwellers and 
had sounded them out with oldfashioned oscilloscopes to get a 
few basic facts about them. Then, 
convinced that they were useless 
and harmless, they had ignored 
the vizzies. They hadn't even 
named them. 

There were some reports that 
the creatures made an occasional 
pilgrimage to the surface — "I 
must have half-remembered that 
when I was concocting our yarn," 
said Sam — but the reports had 
been undocumented and were 
put down to legend. There was 
no official record of such a visitation having occurred. 

Until now. 

ALEX attached a grapple to 
the pilotless rocket and sent 
it out to get some samples. They 



THE HOAXTERS 



141 



watched on the screen as the craft 
dipped low and scooped up a 
bucketful at the end of a cable. 
When these were fetched to them, 
the researchers cautiously transferred the vizzies, by remote-control handlers, to a huge copper 
tank. Their slate color showed up 
well against the bright copper 
and the men watched as the creatures boiled around in the bottom of «h\ 

The short day of the asteroid 
waned. The fleeting dusk became 
night as successive tests showed 
that the tiny vizzies had no taste 
for copper, iron, steel, lead, zinc, 
or any other metal or alloy of 
metal. But when rock or slate 
was dropped into a container with 
the creatures, it was gobbled 'up 
in a twinkling. 

"At the rate they eat," said 
Alex, "you'd think they'd have 
gorged their way clear through 
the asteroid by now." 

"Unless," suggested Sam, "they 
have only a short feeding season 
—which is what this must be— 
and they spend the rest of the 
time back underground, digesting." 

But this question was academic. The problem was how to 
stop the horde from crunching 
into the Cliff face and causing avalanches which eventually 
would undermine their plateautop research station. It wasn't 
only a question of keeping the 



vizzies from overrunning the 
place; they had to be kept from 
collapsing it from underneath. 

The problem had answered itself, in part, the next time the 
unmanned rocket flew over the 
horde. Continuing rock falls had 
transformed the plateau edge 
from a sheer cliff to a slope — a 
slope the vizzies were capable 
of climbing. And up they were 
coming, clearly shown in the 
image on the radar screen. 

Sam tugged thoughtfully at 
his beard and Alex chewed on 
the end of a mustache which had 
become scraggly, while they 
watched the vizzies glitter their 
eerie way to the summit. 

"Look," said Alex, "couldn't 
we fence in the station with 
metal? It'd take a lot of fence, 
but we could do it. Then, even 
if they ate around us, we'd still 
be standing on solid ground." 

"If you're thinking of the cyclone fencing we have in the 
warehouse," Sam pointed out, 
"you're thinking the wrong think. 
Metal doesn't repel them; they 
just don't like the taste of it. And 
the holes in a cyclone fence are 
plenty big enough for them to 
crawl through to get to the rock 
on the other side. Then they'd 
eat the foundations right out 
from under us." 

"Yeah," said Alex. "That's a 
fact." 

He sat down and thought hard. 



142 




 



He got up and ran the latest films 
from the rocket through the projector. As he studied them, worrying his mustache with his teeth, 
he brightened. 

"Now I have got it!" 

A LEX snatched up a portable 
searchlight and his gear and 
dashed out into the airlock. 

Sam hammered on the door, 
then clambered into his own gear 
and went out through the second 
airlock. He chased after Alex 
through the starry night. 

"Wait, you crazy nut!" he 
yelled. 

He caught up with Alex near 
the edge of the plateau. By now 
the vizzies had reached the top 
and were moving forward with 
barely perceptible speed. 

Alex fingered the controls on 
his gravity belt and - soared a 
dozen feet into the airless sky, 
then nudged himself forward until he was above the horde. He 
played his searchlight down on 
the vizzies, first at one angle, then 
another. 

The creatures were brightly 
visible, now that the men were 
so close to them. They continued 
to move forward. Sam stepped 
back and shouted at Ale*. His 
voice was tinny in the transmitter. 

"Get down from there, you 
dope! What happens if you fall 
in?" 



"You might have to play solo 
chess," Alex replied placidly. 
"But don't worry. I think I've 
got them licked. Are they still 
moving?" 

"Helt, yes!" cried Sam. Involuntarily, he stepped back another 
couple of feet. "If anything, 
they're moving faster." 

"Good," said Alex from up in 
the air ''Now we'll see." 

He dipped into a shallow dive 
and landed neatly beside Sam. 

"Watch," he said. 

Ale* squatted, only inches 
from the vanguard of the vizzie 
plague, and shone bis torch directly at it. 

The creatures were stopping! 

Moreover, they were retreating y 
as the powerful light continued 
to play directly on them from 
the front. 

"Come on," said Alex. "That's 
the answer." 

The men went back to their 
station and turned on all the 
lights, letting them shine through 
the broad glass windows on the 
slate surrounding the buildings. 
A battery of searchlights set low 
at strategic spats completed their 
defenses. 

"It clicked all of a sudden," 
Alex said. "We're east of the 
horde and they moved so slowly 
it was hard to tell. But for a few 
minutes, when the Sun rose, it 
was shining directly in their eyes, 
so to speak. It stopped them — 



THE HOAXTERS 



14J 



but only for as long as the Sun 
was on the horizon. After that, 
the shell of their backs gave them 
protection and they came on 
again. * 

"And remember when we had 
those test vizzies in the copper 
pot in the lab?" asked Alex. "You 
saw how they went boiling 
around in it. They not only don't 
like horizontal light — they can't 
stand it. The light above the pot 
reflected on them from the shiny 
copper inside at all angles. It was 
too much for them." 

When the time came for the 
men to send their daily report, the 
vizzies were swarming outside 
the station. It was entirely sur


rounded, but the creatures kept 
well beyond the shining circle of 
light. 

The message to Base consisted 
of only four words: 

"All well. Progress nil.'* 

Two Hundred and Nineteenth 
Day 

THEY don't like animal flesh 
or cloth or rubber, either," 
said Alex. "So even if my light 
hadn't stopped them, I'd have 
been perfectly safe among them, 
out there." 

"You didn't know that until 
today, though," Sam objected. 
"What else do the tests show?" 
"That's all so far, Sam. Except

lines of Alex's palm to the pebble 
and wrapped itself around it. The 
pebble vanished. Alex put another bit of rock on the opposite 
side of his palm and the vizzie 
wriggled toward it. That, too, disappeared. 

Sam watched the performance 
with an expression of revulsion. 
But the expression changed. 

"Alex!" he yelled. "Look! It 
didn't eat all the pebble. See 
what's left?" 

"Where?" Alex examined his 
palm frowningly. "I don't see 
anything." 

"The light has to hit it just 
right, it's so tiny — just a speck!" 

Alex saw it now, too. But he 
said: "What of it? My vizzie's a 
fastidious eater. Likes to leave a 
little something on the plate." 

"Let me test it," said Sam. 
"Just on a hunch." , 

And., of course, that was it. 

THE appetite of a vizzie led 
them to what they had been 
looking for in the slate rock — 
the rock they'd pounded and 
rolled in vain for seven months. 
They'd been unable to see the 
rare earth because it was in so 
minute a ratio to the rock itself. 

"What dumb luck!" Sam exulted. "The stuff turns out to be 
the one part of the slate the vizzie doesn't like — an infinitesimal 
bit of mineral. So small we could 
have gone on pounding rock till 



Doomsday without seeing it. 
Think how many pounds of the 
stuff we must have sluiced away, 
never knowing it was there!" 

"Sweet little vizzie." Alex 
scratched the back of the creature 
in his palm. "I'm going to get 
you a whole boulder to nibble 
on to your heart's content." 

"It is kind of cute at that, isn't 
it?" remarked Sam. He grinned. 
"Do you know what this means, 
Alex? Do you get the whole picture?" 

"Sure," said Alex solemnly. "It 
means we'll have to catch a whole 
mess of vizzies and feed them 
rock, and then gather up their 
leavings. And I was afraid I'd 
have to do it all by myself because I thought you'd become a 
vizziephobe." 

"You blathering moron! It 
means that every bit of ground 
the vizzies have eaten their way 
across is already panned for us. 
The plain, the cliff, the plateau — 
even our front yard. All we have 
to do to get the mineral is go out 
and scoop it up." 

"Well, sure," Alex said. "That's 
fine, of course. But that means no 
more crushing and picking rock, 
which "means even more time to 
go batty." 

"What have you got in mind?" 
Sam asked suspiciously. 

Alex looked wistful. "I wish we 
could have another party."

The Luckiest 
Man in Denv 

By SIMON EISNER 

To get the break of his Hie, 
all Reuben had to do was turn 
the death trap into a jackpot! 



MAY'S man Reuben, of the 
eighty-third level, Atomist, knew there was 
something wrong when the binoculars flashed and then went 
opaque. Inwardly lie cursed, hoping that he had not committed 
himself to anything. Outwardly 
he was unperturbed. He handed 
the binoculars back to Rudolph's 
man Almon. of the eighty-ninth 
level. Maintainer, with a smile. 

"They aren't very good," he 
said. 



Illustrated by EMSH 



Almon put them to his own 
eyes, glanced over the parapet 
and swore mildly. "Blacker than 
the heart of a crazy Angel, eh? 
Never mind; here's another pair." 

This pair was unremarkable. 
Through it, Reuben studied the 
thousand setbacks and penthouses, of Dcnv that ranged themselves below. He was too worried 
to enjoy his first sight of the 
vista from the eighty-ninth level, 
but he let out a murmur of appreciation. Now to get away from 



THE LUCKIEST MAN IN DENV 



147 



this suddenly sinister fellow and 
try to puzzle it out. 

"Could we — ?" he asked cryptically, with a little upward jerk 
of his chin. 

"It's better not to," Almon said 
hastily, taking the glasses from 
his hands. "What if somebody 
with stars happened to see, you 
know? How'd you like it if you 
saw some impudent fellow peering up at you?" 

"He wouldn't dare!" said Reuben, pretending to be stupid and 
indignant, and joined a moment 
later in Almon's sympathetic 
laughter. 

"Never mind," said Almon. 
"We are young. Some day, who 
knows? Perhaps we shall look 
from the ninety-fifth level, or the 
hundredth." 

Though Reuben knew that the 
Maintainer was no friend of his, 
the generous words sent blood 
hammering through his veins ; 
ambition for a moment. 

He pulled a long face and told 
Almon: "Let us hope so. Thank 
you for being my host. Now I 
must return to my quarters." 

He left the windy parapet 
for the serene luxury of an 
eighty-ninth -level corridor and 
descended slow moving stairs 
through gradually less luxurious 
levels to his own Spartan floor. 
Selene was waiting, smiling, as he 
stepped off the stairs. 

She was decked out nicely— 



too nicely. She wore a steely hued 
corselet and a touch of scent; 
her hair was dressed long. The 
combination appealed to him, 
and instantly he was on his 
guard. Why had she gone to the 
trouble of learning his tastes? 
What was she up to? After all, 
she was Griffin's woman. 

"Coming down?" she asked, 
awed. "Where have you been?" 

"The eighty-ninth, as a guest 
of that fellow Almon. The vista 
is immense." 

"I've never been . . ." she murmured, and then said decisively: 
"You belong up there. And 
higher. Griffin laughs at me, but 
he's a fool. Last night in chamber 
we got to talking about you, I 
don't know how, and he finally 
became quite angry and said he 
didn't want to hear another 
word." She smiled wickedly. "I 
was revenged, though." 

Blank-faced, he said: "You 
must be a good hand at revenge, 
Selene, and at stirring up the 
need for it." 

The slight hardening of her 
smile meant that he had scored 
and he hurried by with a rather 
formal salutation. 

Burn him for an Angelo, but 
she was easy enough to take! The 
contrast of the metallic garment 
with her soft, white skin was disturbing, and her long hair suggested things. It was hard to 
think of her as scheming some


148 




 



thing or other; scheming Selene 
was displaced in his mind by 
Selene in chamber. 

But what was she up to? Had 
she perhaps heard that he was 
to be elevated? Was Griffin going 
to be swooped on by the Maintainers? Was he to kill off Griffin 
so she could leech onto some rising third party? Was she perhaps 
merely giving her man a touch 
of the lash? 

He wished gloomily that the 
binoculars-problem and the Selene-problem had not come together. That trickster Almon had 
spoken of youth as though it 
were something for congratulation; he hated being young and 
stupid and unable to puzzle out 
the faulty binoculars and the 
warmth of Griffin's woman. 

THE attack ' alarm roared 
through the Spartan corridor. 
He ducked through the nearest 
door into a vacant bedroom and 
under the heavy steel table. 
Somebody else floundered under 
the table a moment later, and a 
third person tried to join them. 

The firstcomer roared: "Get 
out and find your own shelter! 
I don't propose to be crowded 
out by you or to crowd you out 
either and see your ugly blood 
and brains if there's a hit. Go, 
now!" 

"Forgive me. sir! At once, sir!" 
the latecomer wailed; and scram


bled away as the alarm continued 
to roar. 

. Reuben gasped at the "sirs" 
and looked at his neighbor. It 
was May! Trapped, no doubt, on 
an inspection tour of the level. 

"Sir," he said respectfully, "if 
you wish to be alone, I can find 
another room." 

"You may stay with me for 
company. Are you one of mine?" 
There was power in the general'! 
voice and on his craggy face. 

"Yes, sir. May's man Reuben, 
of the eighty-third level, Atomist." 

May surveyed him, and Reuben noted that there were 
pouches of skin depending from 
cheekbones and the jaw line— 
dead-looking, coarse-pored skin. 

"You're a well-made boy, Reuben. Do you have women?" 

"Yes, sir," said Reuben hastily. 
"One after another — I always 
have women. I'm making up at 
this time to a charming thing 
called Selene. Well-rounded, yet 
firm, soft but supple, with long 
red hair and long white legs — " 

"Spare me the details," muttered the general. "It takes all 
kinds. An Atomist, you said. 
That has a future, to be sure. I 
myself was a Controller long ago. 
The calling seems to have gone 
out of fashion — " 

Abruptly the alarm stopped. 
The silence was hard to bear. 

May swallowed and went on: 



THE LUCKIEST MAN IN DENV 



14V 



** — for some reason or other. Why 
don't youngsters elect for Controller any more? Why didn't 
you, for instance?" 

Reuben wished he could be 
saved by a direct hit. The binoculars, Selene, the raid, and now 
he was supposed to make intelligent conversation with a general. 

"I really don't know, sir," he 
said miserably. "At the time there 
seemed to be very little difference — Controller, Atomist, Missiler, Maintainer. We have a 
saying, 'The buttons are different.' which usually ends any conversation on the subject." 

"Indeed?" asked May distractedly. His face was thinly 
filmed with sweat. "Do you suppose Ellay intends to clobber us 
this time?" he asked almost 
hoarsely. "It's been some weeks 
since they made a maximum effort, hasn't it?" 

"Four," said Reuben. "I remember because one of my best 
Servers was killed by a falling 
corridor roof — the only fatality 
and it had to happen to my 
team!" 

He laughed nervously and 
realized that he was talking like 
a fool, but May seemed not to 
notice. 

Far below them, there was a 
Series of screaming whistles as 
the interceptors were loosed to 
begin their intricate, double basfcetwork wall of defense in a 

150 I 



towering cylinder about Denv. 

"Go on, Reuben," said May. 
"That was most interesting." His 
eyes were searching the underside of the steel table. 

Reuben averted his own eyes 
from the frightened face, feeling 
some awe drain out of him. Under a table with a general! It 
didn't seem so strange now. 

"Perhaps, sir, you can tell me 
what a puzzling thing, that happened this afternoon, means. A 
fellow — Rudolph's man Almon, 
of the eighty-ninth level — gave 
me a pair of binoculars that 
flashed in my eyes and then went 
opaque. Has your wide experience — " 

May laughed hoarsely and said 
in a shaky voice: "That old trick! 
He was photographing your re; tinas for the blood-vessel pattern. One of Rudolph's men, eh? 
I'm glad you spoke to me; I'm 
old enough to spot a revival like 
that. Perhaps my good friend 
; Rudolph plans — " 

There was a thudding volley in 
the air and then a faint jar. One 
had got through, exploding, from 
1 the feel of it, far down at the 
! foot of Denv. 

i The alarm roared again, in 
bursts that meant all clear; only 
i one flight of missiles and that 
i disposed of. 

i 

"HpHE Atomist and the general 
i climbed out from under the 


 



table; May's secretary popped 
through the door. The general 
waved him out again and leaned 
heavily on the table, his arms 
quivering. Reuben hastily brought 
a chair. 

"A glass of water," said May. 

The Atomist brought it. He 
saw the general wash down what 
looked like a triple dose of xxx 
— green capsules which it was 
better to leave alone. 

May said after a moment: 
"That's better. And don't look 
so shocked, youngster; you don't 
know the strain we're under. It's 
only a temporary measure which 
I shall discontinue as soon as 
things ease up a bit. I was saying 
that perhaps my good friend Rudolph plans to substitute one of 
his men for one of mine. Tell me, 
how long has this fellow Almon 
been a friend of yours?" 

"He struck up an acquaintance 
with me only last week. I should 
have realized — " 

"You certainly should have. 
One week. Time enough and 
more. By now you've been photographed, your fingerprints taken, 
your voice recorded and your 
gait studied without your knowledge. Only the retinascope is difficult, but one must risk it for a 
real double. Have you killed your 
man, Reuben?" 

He nodded; It had been a silly 
brawl two years ago over precedence at the refectory; he dis


liked being reminded of it. 

"Good," said May grimly. 
"The way these things are done, 
your double kills you in a secluded spot, disposes of your 
body and takes over your role. 
We shall reverse it. You will kill 
the double and take over his 
role." 

The powerful, methodical voice 
ticked off possibilities and contingencies, measures, and countermeasures. Reuben absorbed 
them and felt his awe return. Perhaps May had not really been 
frightened under the table; perhaps it had been he reading his 
own terror in the general's face. 
May was actually talking to him 
of backgrounds and policies. "Up 
from the eighty-third level!" he 
swore to himself as the great 
names were uttered. 

"My good friend Rudolph, of 
course, wants the five stars. You 
would not know this, but the 
man who wears the stars is now 
eighty years old and failing fast. 
I consider myself a likely candidate to replace him. So, evidently, must Rudolph. No doubt 
he plans to have your double perpetrate some horrible blunder on 
the eve of the election, and the 
discredit would reflect on me. 
Now what you and I must do — ** 

You and I — May's man Reuben and May — up from the 
eighty-third! Up from the bare 
corridors and cheerless bedrooms 



THE LUCKIEST MAN IN DENV 



151 



to marble halls and vaulted 
chambers! From the clatter of 
the crowded refectory to small 
and glowing restaurants where 
you had your own table and servant and where music came 
softly from the walls! Up from 
the scramble to win this woman 
or that, by wit or charm or the 
poor bribes you could afford, to 
the eminence from which you 
could calmly command your pick 
of the beauty of Denv! From the 
moiling intrigue of tripping your 
fellow Atomist and guarding 
against him tripping you to the 
heroic thrust and parry of generals! 

Up from the eighty-third! 

Then May dismissed htm with 
a speech whose implications were 
deliriously exciting. "I need an 
able man and a young one, Reuben. Perhaps I've waited too long 
looking for him. If you do well 
in this touchy business, I'll consider you very seriously for an 
important task I have in mind." 

T ATE that night, Selene came 
to his bedroom. 

"I know you don't like me," 
she said pettishly, "but Griffin's 
such a fool and I wanted somebody to talk to. Do you mind? 
What was it like up there today? 
Did you see carpets? I wish I had 
a carpet.** 

He tried to think about carpets 
and not the exciting contrast of 



metallic cloth and flesh. 

"I saw one through an open 
door," he remembered. "It looked 
odd, but I suppose a person gets 
used to them. Perhaps I didn't 
see a very good one. Aren't the 
good ones very thick?" 

"Yes," she said. "Your feet sink 
into them. I wish I had a good 
carpet and four chairs and a 
small table as high as my knees 
to put things on and as many 
pillows as I wanted. Griffin's such 
a fool. Do you think I'll ever get 
those things? I've never caught 
the eye of a general. Am I pretty 
enough to get one, do you think?" 

He said uneasily: "Of course 
you're a pretty thing, Selene. But 
carpets and chairs and pillows — " 
It made him uncomfortable, like 
the thought of peering up through 
binoculars from a parapet. 

"I want them," she said unhappily. "I like you very much, 
but I want so many things and 
soon I'll be too old even for the 
eighty-third level, before I've 
been Up higher, and I'll spend the 
rest of my life tending babies or 
cooking in the creche or the refectory." 

She stopped abruptly, pulled 
herself together and gave him a 
smile that was somehow ghastly 
in the half-light. 

"You bungler," he said, and 
she instantly looked at the door 
with the smile frozen on her face. 
Reuben took a pistol from undef 



IM 




 



his pillow and demanded, "When 
do you expect him?" 

"What do you mean?" she 
asked shrilly. "Who are you talking about?" 

"My double. Don't be a fool, 
Selene. May and I — " he savored 
it — "May and I know all about 
it. He warned me to beware of a 
diversion by a woman while the 
double slipped in and killed me. 
When do you expect him?" 

"I really do like you," Selene 
sobbed. "But Almon promist d to 
take me up there and I knew 
when I was where they'd see me 
that I'd meet somebody really 
important. I really do like you, 
but soon I'll be too old — " 

"Selene, listen to me. Listen 
to mc! You'll get your chance. 
Nobody but you and me will 
know that the substitution didn't 
succeed!" 

"Then I'll be spying for you 
on Almon. won't I?" she asked in 
a choked voice. "Al! I wanted 
was a few nice things before I got 
too old. All right, I was supposed 
to be in your arms at 2350 
hours." 

IT was 2349. Reuben sprang 
from bed and stood by the 
door, his pistol silenced and 
ready. At 2350 a naked man 
slipped swiftly into the room, 
heading for the bed as he raised 
a ten -centimeter poignard. He 
stopped in dismay when he 




realized that the bed was empty. 

Reuben killed him with a bullet 
through the throat. 

"But he doesn't look a bit like 
mc," he said in bewilderment, 
closely examining the face. "Just 
in a general way." 

Selene said dully: "Almon told 
me people always say that when 
they see their doubles. It's funny, 
isn't it? He looks just like you, 
really." 

"How was my body to be disposed of?" 

She produced a small flat box. 
"A shadow suit. You were to be 
left here and somebody would 
come tomorrow." 

"We won't disappoint him." 
Reuben pulled the web of the 
shadow suit over his double and 
turned on the power. In the half* 
lit room, it was a perfect disappearance; by daylight it would 
be less perfect. "They'll ask why 
the body was shot instead of 
knifed. Tell them you shot me 
with the gun from under the pillow. Just say I heard the double 
come in and you were afraid 
there might have been a struggle." 

She listlessly asked: "How do 
you know I won't betray you?" 

"You won't, Selene." His voice 
bit. "You're broken." 

She nodded vaguely, started to 
say something and then went out 
without saying it. 

Reuben luxuriously stretched 



THE LUCKIEST MAN IN DENV 



153 



in his narrow bed. Later, his beds 
would be wider and softer, he 
thought. He drifted into sleep on 
a half-formed thought that some 
day he might vote with other 
generals on the man to wear the 
five stars — or even wear them 
himself, Master of Denv. 

He slept healthily through the 
morning alarm and arrived late 
at his regular twentieth -level station. He saw his superior, May's 
man Oscar of the eighty-fifth 
level, Atomist, ostentatiously take 
his name. Let him! 

Oscar assembled his crew for 
a grim announcement: "We are 
going to even the score, and perhaps a little better, with Ellay. 
At sunset there will be three 



flights of missiles from Deck 
One.** 

There was a joyous murmur 
and Reuben trotted off on his 
task. 

All forenoon he was occupied 
with drawing plutonium slugs 
from hyper-suspicious storekeepers in the great rock-quarried 
vaults, and seeing them through 
countless audits and assays all 
the way to Weapons Assembly. 
Oscar supervised the scores there 
who assembled the curved slugs 
and the explosive lenses into 
sixty-kilogram warheads. 

In mid-afternoon there was an 
incident. Reuben saw Oscar step 
aside for a moment to speak to 
a Maintainer whose guard fell on 




 



one of the Assembly Servers, 
and dragged him away as he 
pleaded innocence. He had been 
detected in sabotage. When the 
warheads were in and the Missilers seated, waiting at their 
boards, the two Atomists rode up 
to the eighty -third's refectory. 

The news of a near-maximum 
effort was in the air; it was electric. Reuben heard on all sides 
in tones of self-congratulation : 
"We'll clobber them tonight!" 

"That Server you caught," he 
said to Oscar. "What was he up 
to?" 

His commander stared. "Are 
you trying to learn my job? Don't 
try it, I warn you. If my black 
marks against you aren't enough, 



I could always arrange for some 
fissionable material in your custody to go astray." 

"No, no! I was just wondering 
why people do something like 
that." 

Oscar sniffed doubtfully. "He's 
probably insane, like nil the Angelos. I've heard the climate does 
it to them. You're not a Maintainor or a Controller. Why worry 
about it?" 

"They'll brainburn him, I suppose?" 

"I suppose. Listen!" 

DECK One was firing. One, 
two, three, four, five, six. 
One, two, three, four, five, six. 
One, two, three, four, five, six. 



THE LUCKIEST MAN IN DENV 



155 



People turned to one another 
and shook hands, laughed and 
slapped shoulders heartily. Eighteen missiles were racing through 
the stratosphere, soon to tumble 
on Ellay. With any luck, one or 
two would slip through the first 
wall of interceptors and blast 
close enough to smash windows 
and topple walls in the crazy city 
by the ocean. It would serve the 
lunatics right. 

Five minutes later an exultant 
voice filled most of Denv. 

"Recon missile report," it said. 
"Eighteen launched, eighteen perfect trajectories. Fifteen shot 
down by Ellay first-line interceptors, three shot down by Ellay 
second-line interceptors. Extensive blast damage observed in 
Griffith Park area of Ellay!" 

There were cheers. 

And eight Full Maintainers 
marched into the refectory silently, and marched out with 
Reuben. 

He knew better than to struggle or ask futile questions. Any 
question you asked of a Maintainer was futile. But he goggled 
when they marched him onto an 
upward-bound stairway. 

They rode past the eighty ninth level and Reuben lost 
count, seeing only the marvels 
of the upper reaches of Denv. He 
saw carpets that ran the entire 
length of corridors, and intricate 
fountains, and mosaic walls, 



stained-glass windows, more wonders than he could recognize, 
things for which he had no name. 

He was marched at last into 
a wood-paneled room with a 
great polished desk and a map 
behind it. He saw May, and another man who must have been 
a general — Rudolph? — but sitting at the desk was a frail old 
man who wore a circlet of stars 
on each khaki shoulder. 

The old man said to Reuben: 
"You are an Ellay spy and saboteur." 

Reuben looked at May. Did 
one speak directly to the man 
who wore the stars, even in reply 
to such an accusation? 

"Answer him, Reuben," May 
said kindly. 

"I am May's man Reuben, of 
the eighty-third level, an Atomist." he said. 

"Explain," said the other general heavily, "if you can, why all 
eighteen of the warheads you 
procured today failed to fire." 

"But they did!" gasped Reuben. "The Recon missile report 
said there was blast damage from 
the three that got through and it 
didn't say anything about the 
others failing to fire." 

The other general suddenly 
looked sick and May looked even 
kindlier. The man who wore the 
stars turned inquiringly to the 
chief of the Maintainers, who 
nodded and said : "That was the 




 



Recon missile report, sir." 

The general snapped: "What I 
said was that he would attempt 
to sabotage the attack. Evidently 
he failed. I also said he is a faulty 
double, somehow slipped with 
great case into my good friend 
May's organization. You will find 
that his left thumb print is a 
clumsy forgery of the real Reuben's thumb print and that his 
4 hair has been artificially darkened." 

The old man nodded at the 
chief of the Maintainers, who 
said: "We have his card, sir." 

Reuben abruptly found himself being fingerprinted and deprived of some hair. 

"The f.p.s check, sir," one 
Maintainer said. "He's Reuben." 

"Hair's natural, sir," said another. 

The general began a rearguard action: "My information 
about his hair seems to have been 
inaccurate. But the fingerprint 
means only that Ellay spies substituted his prints for Reuben's 
prints in the files — " 

"Enough, sir," said the old 
man with the stars. "Dismissed. 
All of you. Rudolph. I am surprised. All of you. go." 

TJEUBEN found himself in a 
■**vast apartment with May. 
who was bubbling and chuckling 
uncontrollably until he popped 
.three of the green capsules into 



his mouth hurriedly. 

"This means the eclipse for 
years of my good friend Rudolph," he crowed. "His game 
was to have your double sabotage the attack warheads and so 
make it appear that my organization is rotten with spies. The 
double must have been under 
post -hypnotic, primed to admit 
everything. Rudolph was so sure 
of himself that he made his accusations before the attack, the 
fool !" 

He fumbled out the green capsules again. 

"Sir," said Reuben, alarmed. 

"Only temporary," May muttered, and swallowed a fourth. 
"But you're right. You leave 
them alone. There are big things 
to be done in your time, not in 
mine. I told you I needed a 
young man who could claw his 
way to the top. Rudolph's a fool. 
He doesn't need the capsules because he doesn't ask questions. 
Funny, I thought a coup like the 
double affair would hit me hard, 
but I don't feel a thing. It's not 
like the old days. I used to plan 
and plan, and when the trap 
went snap it was better than this 
stuff. But now I don't fed a 
thing." 

He leaned forward from his 
chair: the pupils of his eyes were 
black bullets. 

"Do you want to work?" he 
demanded. "Do you want your 



THE LUCKIEST MAN I N D EN V

world stood on its head and your 
brains to crack and do the only 
worthwhile job there is to do? 
Answer me!" 

*'Sir, I am a loyal May's man. 
I want to obey your orders and 
use my ability to the full." 

"Good enough," said the general. "You've got brains, you've 
got push. I'll do the spade work. 
I won't last long enough to push 
it through. You'll have to follow. 
Ever been outsidtrof Denv?" 

Reuben stiffened. 

"I'm not accusing you of being 
a spy. It's really all right to go 
outside of Denv. I've been outside. There isn't much to see at 
first — a lot of ground pocked and 
torn up by shorts and overs from 
Ellay and us. Farther out, especially east, it's different. Grass, 
trees, flowers. Places where you 
could grow food. 

"When I went outside, it 
troubled me. It made me ask 
questions. I wanted to know how 
we started. Yes — started. It 
wasn't always like this. Somebody built Denv. Am I getting 
the idea across to you? It wasn't 
always like this.' 

"Somebody set up the reactors 
to breed uranium and make plutonium. Somebody tooled us up 
for the missiles. Somebody wired 
the boards to control them. 
Somebody started the hydroponics tanks. 

"I've dug through the archives. 



Maybe I found something. I saw 
mountains of strength reports, ration reports, supply reports, and 
yet I never got back to the beginning. I found a piece of paper 
and maybe I understood it and 
maybe I didn't. It was about the 
water of the Colorado River and 
who should get how much of it. 
How can you divide water in a 
river? But it could have been the 
start of Denv. Ellay. and the 
missile attacks." 

The general shook his head, 
puzzled, and went on: "I don't 
see clearly what's ahead. I want 
to make peace between Denv and 
Ellay, but I don't know how to 
start or what it will be like. I 
think it must mean not firing, not 
even making any more weapons. 
Maybe it means that some of us, 
or a lot of us. will go out of Denv 
and live a different kind of life. 
That's why I've clawed my way 
up. That's why I need a young 
man who can claw with the best 
of them. Tell me what you think." 

"I think," said Reuben measuredly, "it's magnificent — the salvation of Denv. I'll back you to 
my dying breath if you'll let me." 

May smiled tiredly and leaned 
back in the chair as Reuben tiptoed out. 

WHAT luck, Reuben thought 
— what unbelievable luck to 
be at a fulcrum of history like 
this! 



158 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He searched the level for Rudolph's apartment and gained 
admission. 

To the general, he said: "Sir, 
I have to report that your friend 
IVlay is insane. He has just been 
raving to me, advocating the destruction of civilization as we 
know it, and urging me to follow 
in his footsteps. I pretended to 
agree — since I can be of greater 
service to you if I'm in May's 
confidence." 

"So?" said Rudolph thoughtfully. "Tell me about the .double. 
How did that go wrong?" 

"The bunglers were Selene and 
Almon. Selene because she 
alarmed me instead of distracting 
me. Almon because he failed to 
recognize her incompetence." 

"They shall be brainburned. 
That leaves an eighty-ninth-level 
vacancy in my organization, 
doesn't it?" 

"You're very kind, sir, but I 



think I should remain a May's 
man— outwardly. If I earn any 
rewards. I can wait for them. I 
presume that May will be elected 
to wear the five stars. He won't 
live more than two years nftrr 
that, at the rate he is taking 
drugs." 

"We can shorten it," grinned 
Rudolph. "I have pharmacists 
who can see that his drugs are 
more than normal strength." 

"That would be excellent, sir. 
When he is too enfeebled to discharge his duties, there may be 
an attempt to rake up the affair 
of the double to discredit you. 1 
could then testify that I was your 
man all along and that May 
coerced me." 

They put their heads together, 
the two saviors of civilization as 
they knew it, and conspired ingeniously long into the endless 
night.
