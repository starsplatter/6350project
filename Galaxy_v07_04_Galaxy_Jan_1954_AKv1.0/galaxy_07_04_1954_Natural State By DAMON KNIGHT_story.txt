Natural State By DAMON KNIGHT 
and his habitually sullen 
expression enabled him to dominate any stage not occupied by 
an unclothed woman at least as 
large as himself. At twenty-six, 
he had a very respectable following among the housewives of 
Manhattan, Queens, Jersey and 
the rest of the seven boroughs. 
The percentage of blown fuses 
resulting from subscribers' attempts to clutch his realized 
image was extraordinarily low — 
Alvah, his press agents explained 
with perfect accuracy, left them 
too numb. 

Young Gustad, who frequently 
made his first entrance waterbeaded as from the shower, with 
a towel girded chastely around 
his loins, was nevertheless in his 
private life a modest and slightly 
bewildered citizen, much given to 
solitary reading, and equipped 
with a perfect set of the conventional virtues. 

These included cheerful performance of all municipal duties 
and obligations — like every rightthinking citizen, Gustad held 
down two jobs in summer and 
three in winter. At the moment, 
for example, he was an actor by 
day and a metals-reclamation 
supervisor by night. 

Chief among his less tangible 
attributes, was that emotion 
which in some ages has been 
variously described as civic pride 
or patriotism. In A.D. 2064, as 



in B.C. 400, they amounted to 
the same thing. 

"OEHIND the Manager's desk, 
the wall was a single huge 
slab of black duroplast, with a 
map of the city picked out in 
pinpoints of brilliance. As Gustad 
entered with his manager and his 
porter, an unseen chorus of basso 
profundos broke into the strains 
of The Slidewalks of New York. 
After four bars, it segued to New 
York, New York, It's a Pip of a 
Town and slowly faded out. 

The Manager himself, the Hon. 
Boleslaw Wytak, broke the reverent hush by coming forward to 
take Alvah's hand and lead him 
toward the desk. "Mr. Gustad — 
and Mr. Diamond, isn't it? Great 
pleasure to have you here. I don't 
know if you've met all these gentlemen. Commissioner Laurence, 
of the Department of Extramural 
Relations — Director Ostertag, of 
the Bureau of Vital Statistics — 
Chairman Neddo, of the Research 
and Development Board." 

Wytak waited until everyone 
was comfortably settled in one of 
the reclining chairs which fitted 
into slots in the desk, with cigars, 
cigarettes, liquor capsules and 
cold snacks at each man's elbow. 
"Now, Mr. Gustad — and Mr. 
Diamond — I'm a plain blunt man 
and I know you're wondering 
why I asked you to come here 
today. I'm going to tell you. The 



8 




 



City needs a man with great talent and great courage to do a job 
that, I tell you frankly, I wouldn't 
undertake myself without great 
misgivings." He gazed at Gustad 
warmly, affectionately but sternly. "You're the man, Alvah." 

Little Jack Diamond cleared 
his throat nervously. "What kind 
of a job did you have in mind, 
Mr. Manager? Of course, anything we can do for our city . . ." 

Wytak's big face, without perceptibly moving a muscle, somehow achieved a total change of 
expression. "Alvah, I want you to 
go to the Sticks." 

Gustad blinked and tilted upright in his chair. He looked at 
Diamond. 

The little man suddenly seemed two sizes smaller inside his 
box-cut cloth-of-silver tunic. He 
gestured feebly and wheezed, 
"Wake-me-up!" The porter behind his chair stepped forward 
alertly, clanking, and flipped open 
one of the dozens of metal and 
plastic boxes that clung to him 
all over like barnacles. He popped 
a tiny capsule into his palm, 
rolled it expertly to thumb-andfinger position, broke it under 
Diamond's nose. 

A reeking-sweet green fluid 
dripped from it and ran stickily 
down the front of Diamond's 
tunic. 

"Dumbhead!" said Diamond. 
"Not cream de menthy, a wake


me-up!" He sat up as the abashed 
servant produced another capsule. "Never mind." Some color 
was beginning to come back into 
his face. "Blotter!" A wad of 
absorbent fibers. "Vacuum!" A 
lemon-sized globe with a flaring 
snout. "Gon-Stink! Presser!" 

Gustad looked back at the 
Manager. "Your Honor, you 
mean you want me to go into 
the Sticks? I mean," he said, 
groping for words, "you want me 
to play for the Muckfeet?" 

"That is just exactly what I 
want you to do." Wytak nodded 
toward the Commissioner, the 
Director, and the Chairman. 
"These gentlemen are here to 
tell you why. Suppose you start, 
Ozzie." 

|~VSTERTAG, the one with the 
fringe of yellowish white hair 
around his potato-colored pate, 
shifted heavily and stared at 
Gustad. "In my bureau, we have 
records of population and population density, imports and exports, ratio of births to deaths 
and so on that go back all the 
way to the time of the United 
States. Now this isn't known generally, Mr. Gustad, but although 
New York has been steadily 
growing ever since its founding in 
1646, our growth in the last 
thirty years has been entirely due 
to immigration from other less 
fortunate citjes.

"In a way, it's fortunate — I 
mean to say that we can't expand horizontally, because it has 
been found impossible to eradicate the soil organisms — " a delicate shudder ran around the 
group — "left by our late enemies. 
And as for continuing to build 
vertically — well, since Pittsburgh 
fell, we have been dependent almost entirely on salvaged scrap 
for our steel. To put it bluntly, 
unless something is done about 
this situation, the end is in sight. 
Not alone of this administration, 
but of the city as well. Now the 
reasons for this — ah — what shall 
I say . . ." 

With his head back, staring at 
the ceiling, Wytak began to speak 
so quietly that Ostertag blundered through another phrase and 
a half before he realized he had 
been superseded as interlocutor. 

"Thirty years ago, when I first 
came to this town, an immigrant 
kid with nothing in the whole 
world but the tunic on my back 
and the gleam in my eye, we had 
just got through with the last of 
the Muckfeet Wars. According to 
your history books, we won that 
war. I'll tell you something — we 
were licked!" 

Alvah squirmed uncomfortably 
as Wytak raised his head and 
glanced defiantly around the 
desk, looking for contradiction: 
The Manager said, "We drove 
them back to the Ohio, thirty 



years ago. And where are they 
now?" He turned to Laurence. 
"Phil?" 

Laurence rubbed his long nose 
with a bloodless forefinger. "Their 
closest settlement is twelve miles 
away. That's to the southwest, of 
course. In the west and north — " 

"Twelve miles," said Wytak reflectively. "But that isn't the reason I say they licked us. They 
licked us because there are twenty 
million of us today . . . and about 
one hundred fifty million of them. 
Right, Phil?" 

Laurence said, "Well, there 
aren't any accurate figures, you 
know, Boley. There hasn't been 
any census of the Muckfeet for 
almost a century, but — " 

"About one hundred fifty million," interrupted Wytak. "Even 
if we formed a league with every 
other city on this continent, the 
odds would be heavily against 
us — and they breed like flies." 
He slapped the desk with his 
open palm. "So do their filthy 
animals!" 

A SHUDDER rippled across 
the group. Diamond shut his 
eyes tight. 

"There it is," said Wytak. 
"Rome fell. Babylon fell. The 
same thing can happen to New 
York. Those illiterate savages 
will go on increasing year by 
year, getting more ignorant and 
more degraded with every genera


10 




 



tion . . . and a century from now 
— or two, or five — they'll be the 
human race. And New York . . ." 

Wytak turned to" look at the 
map behind him. His hand touched a button and the myriad tiny 
lights went out. 

Gustad was not an actor who 
wept readily, but he felt tears 
welling over his eyelids. At the 
same time, the thought crossed 
his mind that, competition being 
what it was in the realies, it was 
a good thing that Wytak had 
gone into politics instead of acting. 

"Sir," he said, "what can we 
do?" 

Wytak's eyes were focused far 
away. After a moment, his head 
turned heavily on his massive 
shoulders, like a gun turret. 
"Chairman Neddo has the answer 
to that. I want you to listen 
carefully to what he's going to 
tell you, Alvah." 

Neddo's crowded small face 
flickered through a complicated 
series of twitches, all centripetal 
and rapidly executed. "Over the 
past several years," he said jerkily, "under Manager Wytak's direction, we have been developing 
certain devices, certain articles of 
commerce, which are designed, 
especially designed, to have an 
attraction for the Muckfeet. 
Trade articles. Most of these, I 
should say all of — " 

"Trade articles," Wytak cut 



in softly. "Thank you, Ned. 
That's the. phrase that tells the 
story. Alvah, we're going to go 
back to the principles that made 
our ancestors great. Trade — expanding markets — expanding industries. Think about it. From 
the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of 
Mexico, there are some 150 million people who haven't got a cigarette lighter or a wristphone or 
a realie set among them. Alvah, 
we're going to civilize the Muckfeet. We've put together a grabbag of modern science, expressed 
in ways their primitive minds 
can understand — and you're the 
man who's going to sell it to 
them! What do you say to that?" 

This was a familiar cue to Gustad — it had turned up for the 
fiftieth or sixtieth time in his last 
week's script, when he had played 
the role of a kill-crazy sewer inspector, trapped by flood waters 
in the cloacae of Under Brooklyn. "I say — " he began, then 
realized that his usual response 
was totally inappropriate. "It 
sounds wonderful," he finished 
weakly. 

W7YTAK nodded in a businesslike way. "Now here's 
the program." He pressed a button, and a relief map of the 
North American continent appeared on the wall behind him. 
"Indicator." Wytak's porter put 
a metal tube with a shaped grip 



NATURAL STATE 



11 



into his hand — a tiny spot on the 
map fluoresced where he pointed 
it. 

"You'll swing down to the 
southwest until you cross the 
Tennessee, then head westward 
about to here, then up through 
the Plains, then back north of 
the Great Lakes and home again. 
You'll notice that this route keeps 
you well clear of both Chicago 
and Toronto. Remember that — 
it's important. We know that 
Frisco is working on a project 
similar to ours, although they're 
at least a year behind us. If we 
know that, the chances are that 
'the other Cities know it too, but 
we're pretty sure there's been 
no leak in our own security. 
There isn't going to be any." 

He handed the indicator back. 
"You'll be gone about three 
months . . . 

Diamond was having trouble 
with his breathing again. 

". . . You'll have to' rough it 
pretty much — there'll be room in 
your floater for you and your 
equipment, and that's all." 

Diamond gurgled despairingly 
and rolled up his eyes. Gustad 
himself felt an unpleasant sinking 
sensation. 

"You mean," he asked incredulously, "I'm supposed to go all 
by myself — without even a porter?" 

"That's right," said Wytak. 
"You see, Alvah, you and I are 



civilized human beings — we know 
there are so many indispensable 
time and labor saving devices 
that nobody could possibly carry 
them all himself. But could you 
explain that to a Muckfoot?" 
"I guess not." 

"That's why only a man with 
your superb talents can do this 
job for the City. Those people 
actually live the kind of sordid 
brutal existence you portray so 
well in the realies. Well, you 
can be as rough and tough as 
they are — you can talk their own 
language, and they'll respect 
you." 

Gustad flexed his muscles 
slightly, feeling pleased but not 
altogether certain. Then a new 
and even more revolting aspect of 
this problem occurred to him. 
"Your Honor, suppose I got along 
too well with the Muckfeet? I 
mean suppose they invited me 
into one of their houses to — " he 
gagged slightly — "eat?" 

Wytak's face went stony. "I 
am surprised that you feel it 
necessary to bring that subject 
up. All that will be covered very 
thoroughly in the briefing you 
will get from Commissioner Laurence and Chairman Neddo and 
their staffs. And I want you to 
understand, Gustad, that no pressure of any kind is being exerted 
on you to take this assignment. 
This is a job for a willing, cooperative volunteer, not a draftee. 



12 




 



If you feel you're not the man 
for it, just say so now." 

Gustad apologized profusely. 
Wytak interrupted him, with 
the warmest and friendliest smile 
imaginable. "That's all right, son, 
I understand. I understand perfectly. Well, gentlemen, I think 
that's all." 

A S soon as they were alone, 
Diamond clutched Gustad's 
sleeve and pulled him over to 
the side of the corridor. "Listen 
to me, Al boy. We can still pull 
you out of this. I know a doctor 
that will make you so sick you 
couldn't walk across the street. 
He wouldn't do it for everybody, 
but he owes me a couple of — " 
"No, wait a minute. I don't — " 
"I know, I know," said Diamond impatiently. "You'll get 
your contract busted with Seven 
Boroughs and you'll lose a couple 
months, maybe more, and you'll 
have to start all over again with 
one of the little studios, but what 
of it? In a year or two, you'll 
be as good as — " 
"Now wait, Jack. In the first — " 
"Al, I'm not just thinking about 
my twenty per cent of you. I 
don't even care about that — it's 
just money. What I want, I want 
you should still be alive next 
year, you understand what I 
mean?" 

"Look," said Gustad, "you 
don't understand, Jack. I want to 



go. I mean I don't exactly want 
to, but — " He pointed down the 
corridor to the window that 
framed a vista of gigantic columns, fiercely brilliant below, 
fading to massive darkness above, 
with a million tiny floater-lights 
drifting like a river of Stardust 
down the avenue. "Just look at 
that. It took thousands of years 
to build! I mean if I can keep it 
going just by spending three 
months . . . 

"And besides," he added practically, "think of the publicity." 

II 

HPHE foothill country turned 
out to be picturesque but not 
very rewarding. Alvah had bypassed the ancient states of Pennsylvania and Maryland as directed, since the tribes nearest the 
city were understood to be still 
somewhat rancorous. By the end 
of his first day, he was beginning 
to regard this as a serious understatement. 

He had brought his floater 
down, with flags flying, loudspeakers blaring, colored lights 
flashing and streamers flapping 
gaily behind him, just outside an 
untidy collection of two-story 
beehive huts well south of the 
former Pennsylvania border. He 
had seen numerous vaguely human shapes from the air, but 
when he extruded his platform 



NATURAL STATE 



13 



and stepped out, every visible 
door was shut, the streets were 
empty, and there was no moving 
thing in sight, except for a group 
of singularly unpleasant -looking 
animals in a field to his right. 

After a few moments, Gustad 
shut off the loudspeakers and 
listened. He thought he heard a 
hum of voices from the nearest 
building. Suppressing a momentary qualm, he lowered himself 
on the platform stair and walked 
over to the building. It had a 
single high window, a crude oval 
in shape, closed by a discolored 
pane. 

Standing under this window, 
Alvah called, "Hello in there!" 

The muffled voices died away 
for a moment, then buzzed as 
busily as ever. 

"Come on out — I want to talk 
to you!" 

Same result. 

"You don't have to be afraid! 
I come in peace!" 

The voices died away again, 
and Alvah thought he saw a dim 
face momentarily through the 
pane. A single voice rose on an 
interrogative note. 

"Peace!" Alvah shouted. 

The window slid abruptly back 
into the wall and, as Alvah gaped 
upward, a deluge of slops descended on him, followed by a 
gale of coarse laughter. 

Alvah's immediate reaction, 
after the first dazed and gasping 



instant, was a hot-water-andsoap tropism, carrying with it an 
ardent desire to get out of his 
drenched clothes and throw them 
away. His second, as imperious 
as the first, had the pure flame of 
artistic inspiration — he wanted to 
see how many esthetically satisfying small pieces one explosive 
charge would make out of that 
excrescence-shaped building. 

Under no conditions, said the 
handbook he had been required 
to memorize, will you commit 
any act which might be interpfeted by the Muckieet as aggressive, nor will you make use 
of your weapons at any time, unless such use becomes necessary 
for the preservation of your own 
life. 

Alvah wavered, grew chilly and 
retired. Restored in body, but 
shaken in spirit, he headed south. 

Then there had been his encounter with the old man and the 
animal. Somewhere in the triangle of land between the Mississippi and the Big Black, at a 
point which was not on his itinerary at all, but had the overwhelming attraction of being 
more than a thousand air-miles 
from New York, he had set 
the floater down near another 
sprawling settlement. 

A S usual, all signs of activity 
in and around the village 
promptly disappeared. With new


14 




 



ly acquired caution, Alvah sat 
tight. Normal human curiosity, 
he reasoned, would drive the 
Muckfeet to him sooner or later 
— and even if that failed, there 
was his nuisance value. How long 
could you ignore a strange object, a few hundred yards from 
your home, that was shouting, 
waving flags, flashing colored 
lights and sending up puffs of 
pink-and-green smoke? 

Nothing happened for a little 
over an hour. Then, half dozing 
in his control chair, Alvah saw 
two figures coming toward him 
across the field. 

Alvah's ego, which had been 
taking a beating all day, began 
to expand. He stepped out onto 
the platform and waited. 

The two figures kept coming, 
taking their time. The tall one 
was a skinny loose-jointed oldster with a conical hat on the 
back of his head. The little one 
ambling along in front of him 
was some sort of four-footed 
animal. 

In effect, an audience of one — 
at any rate, it was Alvah's best 
showing so far. He mentally rehearsed his opening lines. There 
was no point, he thought, in 
bothering with the magic tricks or 
the comic monologue. He might 
as well go straight into the sales' 
talk. 

The odd pair was now much 
closer, and Gustad recognized the 



animal half of it. It was a socalled watchdog, one of the incredibly destructive beasts the 
Muckfeet trained to do their 
fighting for them. It had a slender, supple body, a long feline tail 
and a head that looked something like a terrier's and something like a housecat's. However, 
it was not half as large or as 
frightening in appearance as the 
pictures Alvah had seen. It must, 
he decided, be a pup. 

fipWO yards from the platform, 
the oldster came to a halt. 
The watchdog sat down beside 
him, tongue lolling wetly. Alvah 
turned off the loudspeakers and 
the color displays. 

"Friend," he began, "I'm here 
to show you things that will 
astound you, marvels that you 
wouldn't believe unless you saw 
them with your own — " 

"You a Yazoo?" 

Thrown off stride, Alvah gaped. 
"What was that, friend ?" V 

"Ah said — you a Yazoo?" 

"No," said Alvah, feeling reasonably positive. 

"Any kin to a Yazoo?" 

"I don't think so." 

"Git," said the old man. 

Unlikely as it seemed, a Yazoo 
was apparently a good thing to 
be. "Wait a second," said Alvah. 
"Did you say Yazoo? I didn't 
understand you there at first. Am 
I a Yazoo! Why, man, my whole 



NATURAL STATE 



15 



family on both sides has been — " 
what was the plural of Yazoo? 

"Ah'll count to two," said the 
old man. "One." 

"Now wait a minute," said Alvah, feeling his ears getting hot. 
The watchdog, he noticed, had 
hoisted its rump a fraction of an 
inch and was staring at him in a 
marked manner. He flexed his 
right forearm slightly and felt the 
reassuring pressure of the pistol 
in its pop-out holster. "What 
makes you Muckfeet think you 
can—" 

"Two," said the oldster, and 
the watchdog was a spreadeagled blur in midair, seven feet 
straight up from the ground. 

Instinct took over. Instinct had 
nothing to do with pistols or 
holsters, or with the probable size 
of a full-grown Muckfoot watchdog. It launched Alvah's body 
into a backward standing broad 
jump through the open floater 
door, and followed that with an 
economical underhand punch at 
the control button inside. 

The door slammed shut. It 
then bulged visibly inward and 
rang like a gong. Sprawled on 
the floor, Gustad stared at it incredulously. There were further 
sounds — a thunderous growling 
and a series of hackle-raising 
skrieks, as of hard metal being 
gouged by something even harder. The whole floater shook. 

Alvah made the control chair 



in one leap, slammed on the 
power switch and yanked at the 
steering bar.. At an altitude of 
about a hundred feet, he saw the 
dark shape of the watchdog leap 
clear and fall, twisting. 

A few seconds later, he put 
the bar into neutral and looked 
down. Man and watchdog were 
moving slowly back across the 
field toward the settlement. As 
far as Alvah could tell, the beast 
was not even limping. 

A LVAH'S orders were reasonably elastic, but he had already stretched- them badly in 
covering the southward leg of his 
route in one day. Still, there 
seemed to be nothing else to do. 
Either there was an area somewhere on the circuit where he 
could get the Muckfeet to listen 
to him, or there wasn't. If there 
was, it would make more sense 
to hop around until he found it, 
and then work outward to its 
limits, than to blunder straight 
along, collecting bruises and insults. 

And if there wasn't — and this 
did not bear thinking about — 
then the whole trip was a bust. 

Alvah switched on his communicator and tapped out the 
coded clicks that meant, "Proceeding on schedule" — which was 
a lie — "no results yet" — which 
was true. Then he headed north. 

Nightfall overtook him as he 



16 




 



was crossing the Ozark Plateau. 
He set the floater's controls to 
hover at a thousand feet, went 
to bed and slept badly until just 
before dawn. With a cup of kaffin 
in his hand, he watched this phenomenon in surprised disapproval: The scattered lights 
winking out below, the first colorless hint of radiance, which illuminated nothing, but simply 
made the Universe seem more 
senselessly vast and formless than 
before; finally, after an interminable progression of insignificant 
changes, the rinds of orange and 
scarlet, and the dim Sun bulging 
up at the rim of the turning 
Earth. 

It was lousy theater. 

How, Alvah asked himself, 
could any human being keep 
himself from dying of sheer irrelevance and boredom against a 
background like that? He was 
aware that billions had done so, 
but his general impression of history was that people who didn't 
have a city always got busy improving themselves until they 
could build one or take one away 
from somebody else. All but the 
Muckfeet . . . 

Once their interest has been 
engaged, said the handbook at 
one point, you will lay principal 
stress upon the competitive advantages of each product. It will 
be your aim to create a situation 
in which ownership of one or 



more of our products will be not 
only an economic advantage, but 
a mark of social distinction. In 
this way, communities which 
have accepted the innovations 
will, in order to preserve and extend the recognition of their own 
status, be forced to convert members of neighboring communities. 

Well, maybe so. 

Alvah ate a Spartan breakfast 
of protein jelly and citron cakes, 
called in the coordinates and the 
time to the frog- voiced operator 
in New York, and headed the 
floater northward again. 

The landscape unrolled itself. 
If there were any major differences between this country and 
the districts he had seen yesterday, Alvah was unable to discern them. In the air, he saw an 
occasional huge flapping shape, 
ridden by human figures. He 
avoided them, and they ignored 
him. Below, tracts of dark-green 
forest alternated predictably with 
the pale green, red or violet of 
cultivated fields. Here and there 
across the whole visible expanse, 
isolated buildings stood. At intervals, these huddled closer and 
closer together and became a 
settlement. There were perhaps 
more roads as he moved northward, dustier ones. That was all. 

■T^HE dustiness of these roads, it 
occurred to Alvah, was a matter that required investigation. 



NATURAL STATE 



17 



The day was cloudless and clear; 
there was no wind at Alvah's 
level, and nothing in the behavior 
of the trees or cultivated plants 
to suggest that there was any 
farther down. 

He slowed the floater and lowered it toward the nearest road. 
As he approached, the thread of 
ocher resolved itself into an irregular series of expanding puffs, 
each preceded by a black dot, 
the overall effect being that of a 
line of black-and-tan exclamation points. They seemed to be 
moving barely perceptibly, but 
were actually, Alvah guessed, 
traveling at a fairly respectable 
clip. 

He transferred his attention to 
another road. It, too, was filled 
with hurrying dots, as was the 
next — and all the traffic was 
heading in approximately the 
same direction, westward of Alvah's course. 

He swung the control bar over. 
The movement below, he was 
able to determine after twenty 
minutes' flying, converged upon 
a settlement .larger than any he 
had yet seen. It sprawled for ten 
miles or more along the southern 
shore of a long and exceedingly 
narrow lake. Most of it looked 
normal enough — a haphazard arrangement of cone-roofed buildings — but bn the side away from 
the lake, there was a fairly extensive area filled with what seemed 



to be long, narrow sheds. This, 
in turn, was bounded on two sides 
by a strip of fenced-in plots in 
which, as nearly as Alvah could 
make out through the dust, animals of all sizes and shapes were 
penned. It was this area which 
appeared to be the goal of every 
Muckfoot in the central Plains. 

The din was tremendous as Alvah floated down. There were 
shouts, cries, animal bellowings, 
sounds of hammering, occasional 
blurts of something that might 
be intended to be music, explosions of laughter. The newcomers, 
he noted, were being herded with 
much confusion to one or another 
of the fenced areas, where they 
left their mounts. Afterward, they 
straggled across to join the sluggish river of bodies in the avenues 
between the sheds. 

No one looked up or noticed 
the dim shadow of the floater. 
Everyone was preoccupied, shouting, elbowing, blowing an instrument, climbing a pole. Alvah 
found a clear space at some distance from the sheds — as far as 
he could conveniently get from 
the penned animals — and landed. 

He had no idea what this gathering was about. For all he knew, 
it might be a war council or 
some kind of religious observance, in which case his presence 
might be distinctly unwelcome. 
But in any case, there were customers here.

He looked dubiously at the 
stud that controlled his attentioncatchers. If he used them, he 
would only be following directives, but he had a strong feeling 
that it would be a faux pas to 
do so in this situation. At the 
other extreme, the obvious thing 
to do was to get out and go look 
for someone in authority. This 
would involve abandoning the 
protection of the floater, however, and he might blunder into 
some taboo place or ceremony. 

Evidently his proper course 
was to wait unobtrusively until 
he was discovered. On the other 
hand, if he stayed inside the 
floater with the door shut, the 
Muckfeet might take more alarm 
than if he showed himself. Still, 
wasn't it possible that they would 
be merely puzzled by a floater, 
whereas they would be angered 
by a floater with a man on its 
platform? Or, taking it from another angle . . . 

The hell with it. 

A LVAH ran the platform out, 
**■ opened the door and stepped 
out. He was relieved when, as he 
was considering the delicate 
problem of whether or not to 
lower the stair, a small group 
of men and urchins came into 
view around the corner of the 
nearest shed, a dozen yards away 
from him. 

They stopped when they saw 



him, and two or three of the 
smallest children scuttled behind 
their elders. They exchanged 
looks and a few words that Alvah couldn't hear. Then a pudgy 
little man with a fussed expression crowded forward, and the 
rest followed him at a discreet 
distance. 

"Hello," said Alvah tentatively
The little man came to a halt 
a yard or so from the platform. 
He had a white badge of some 
kind pinned to his shapeless 
brown jacket, and carried a sheaf 
of papers in his hand. "Who 
might you be?" he asked irritably. 

"Alvah Gustad is my name. I 
hope I'm not putting you people 
out, parking in your area like 
this, Mr.—" 

"Well, I should hope to spit 
you is, though. Supposed to be 
a tent go up right there. Got to 
be one by noon. What did you 
say your name was, Gus what?" 

"Gustad. I don't believe I 
caught your name, Mr. — " 

"Don't signify what my name 
is. We're talking about you. 
What clan you belong to?" 

"Uh — Flatbush," said Alvah at 
random. "Look, as long as I'm 
in the way here, you just tell me 
where to move to and — " 

"Some little backwoods clan, I 
never even heard of it," said the 
pudgy man. "I'll tell you where 



NATURAL STATE 



19 



you can move to. You can just 
haul that thing back where you 
come from. Gustad — Flatbush! 
You ain't on my list, I know 
that." 

The other Muckfeet had moved 
up gradually to surround the 
little man. One of them, a lanky 
sad-faced youngster, nudged him 
with his elbow. "Might just check 
and see, Jake." 

"Well, I ought to know. My 
land, Artie, I got my work to do. 
I can't spend all day standing 
here." 

Artie's long face grew more 
mournful. "You thought them 
Keokuks wasn't on the list, 
either." 

"Well— all right then, rot it." 
To Alvah: "What's your marks?" 

Alvah blinked. "I don't—" 

"Come down offa there." Jake 
turned impatiently to a man behind him. "Give'm a stake." As 
Alvah came hesitantly down the 
stair, he found he was being 
offered a sharpened length of 
wood by a seamy-faced brown 
man, who carried a bundle of 
others like it under his arm. 

Alvah took it, without the least 
idea of what to do next. The 
brown man watched him alertly. 
"You c'n make your marks with 
that," he volunteered and pointed to the ground between them. 

The others closed in a little. 

"Marks?" said Alvah worriedly. 



fTiHE brown man hesitated, 
then took another stake from 
his bundle. "Like these here," he 
said. "These is mine." He drew 
a shaky circle and put a dot in 
the center of it. "George." A 
figure four. "Allister — that's me." 
A long rectangle with a loop at 
each end. "Coffin — that's m' 
clan." 

Jake burst out, "Well, crying 
in a bucket, he knows that! You 
know how to sign your name, 
don't you?" 

"Well," said Alvah, "yes." He 
wrote Alvah Gustad and, as an 
afterthought, added Flatbush. 

There were surprised whistles. 
"Wrote it just as slick as Doc!" 
said a ten-year-old tow-headed 
male, bug-eyed with awe. 

Jake stared at Alvah, then 
spun half around to wave his 
papers under Artie's nose. "Well, 
you satisfied now, Artie Brumbacher? I guess that ain't on my 
list, is it?" 

"No," Artie admitted, "I guess 
it ain't — not if you can read the 
list, that is." 

Everybody but Alvah laughed, 
Jake louder than anyone. "All 
right," he said, turning back to 
Alvah, "you just hitch up your 
brutes and get that thing our of 
here. If you ain't gone by the 
time I—" 

"Jake!" called a businesslike 
female voice, and a small figure 
came shouldering through the 



20 




 



crowd. "They need you over in 
the salamander shed — the Quincies are ready to move in, but 
there's some Sullivans ahead of 
them." She glanced at Alvah, 
then at the floater behind him. 
"You having any trouble here?" 

"All settled now" Jake told 
her. "This feller ain't on the list. 
I ' just give him his marching 
orders." 

"Look, if I can say something — " Alvah began. 

The girl interrupted him. "Did 
you want to exhibit something at 
the Fair?" 

"That's right," said Alvah 
gratefully. "I was just trying to 
explain — " 

"Well, you're late, but maybe 
we can squeeze you in. You won't 
sell anything, though, if it's what 
I think it is. Let me see that list, 
Jake." 

"Now wait a minute," said 
Jake indignantly. "You know we 
ain't got room for nobody that 
ain't on the list. We got enough 
trouble—" 

"The Earth-movers won't be 
here from Butler till tomorrow," 
said the girl, examining the papers. "We can put him in there 
and move him out again when 
they get here. You need any 
equipment besides what you 
brought?" 

"No," said Alvah. "That would 
be fine, thanks. All I need is a 
place — " 



"All right. Before you go, Jake, 
did you tell those Sullivans they 
could have red, green and yellow 
in the salamander shed?" 

"Well, sure I did. That what it 
says right there." 

CHE handed him back the pa^ pers and pointed to a line. 
"That's Quincy, see? Dot instead 
of a cross. Sullivans are supposed 
to have that corner in the garden 
truck shed, keep the place warm 
for the seedlings, but they won't 
budge till you tell them it was a 
mistake. Babbishes and Stranahans are fit to be tied. You get 
over there and straighten them 
out, will you? And don't worry 
too much about him." 

Jake snorted and moved away, 
still looking ruffled. The girl 
turned to Alvah. "All right, let's 
go." 

Unhappy but game, Alvah 
turned and climbed back into 
the floater with the girl close behind him. The conditioning he'd 
had just before he left helped 
when he was in the open air, but 
in the tiny closed cabin of the 
floater the girl's triply compounded stench was overpowering. 

How did they live with themselves? 

She leaned over the control 
chair, pointing. "Over there," she 
said. "See that empty space I'm 
pointing at?" 



NATURAL STATE

Alvah saw it and put the floater there as fast as the generator 
would push it. The space was 
not quite empty — there were a 
few very oddly assorted Muckfeet and animals in it, but they 
straggled out when they saw him 
hovering, and he set the floater 
down. 

To his immense relief, the girl 
got out immediately. Alvah followed her as far as the platform. 

Ill 

IN a tailor shop back in Middle 
Queens, the proprietors, two 
brothers named Wynn, whose 
sole livelihood was the shop, 
stared glumly at the bedplate 
where the two-hundred-gallon 
Klenomatic ought to have been. 

"He say anything when he 
took it away?" Clyde asked. 

Morton shrugged and made a 
sour face. 

"Yeah," said Clyde. He looked 
distastefully at a dead cigar and 
tossed it at the nearest oubliette. 
He missed. 

"He said a month, two 
months," Morton told him. "You 
know what that means." 

"Yeah." 

"So I'll call up the factory," 
Morton said violently. "But I 
know what they're gonna tell me. 
Give us a deposit and we'll put 
you on a waiting list. Waiting 
list!" 



"Yeah," said Clyde. 

In a factory in Under Bronnix, 
the vice president in charge of 
sales shoved a thick folder of 
coded plastic slips under the nose 
of the vice president in charge 
of production. "Look at those 
orders," he said. 

"Uh-huh," said Production. 

"You know how far back they 
go? Three years. You know how 
much money this company's lost 
in unfilled orders? Over two million—" 

"I know. What do you expect? 
Every fabricator in this place is 
too old. We're holding them together with spit and string. Don't 
bother me, will you, Harry. I 
got my own — " 

"Listen," said Sales. "This 
can't go on much longer. It's up 
to us to tell the Old Man that 
he's got to try a bigger bribe on 
the Metals people. Mortgage the 
plant if we have to — it's the only 
thing to do." 

"We have more mortgages now 
than the plant is worth." 

Sales reddened. "Nick, this is 
serious. Last fall, it looked like 
we might squeeze through another year, but now . . . You 
know what's going to happen in 
another eight, ten months?" He 
snapped his fingers. "Right down 
the drain." 

Production blinked at him 
wearily. "Bribes are no good any 
more, Harry. You know that as 



22 




 



well as I do. They're out." 

"Well, then what are we going 
to do?" 

Production shook his head. "I 
don't know. I swear to God, I 
don't know." 

|~VVER in Metals Reclamation 
Four, in Under and Middle 
Jersey, the night shift was just 
beginning. In the blue-lit cavern 
of Ferrous, this involved two 
men, one bald and flabby, the 
other gray and gnarled. They 
exchanged a silent look, then each 
in turn put his face into the time 
clock's retinoscope mask. The 
clock, which had been emitting a 
shrill irritating sound, gurgled 
its satisfaction and shut up. 

"Well, that's it," said the gray 
one. "I'll be your work gang and 
you be mine, huh?" 

The flabby one spat. "Wonder 
what happened to Turk." 

"Who cares? I never liked 
him." 

"Just wondering. Yesterday 
he's here, today where is he? 
Labor pool, army — " he spat 
again, with care — "repair, maintenance . . . He was fifteen years 
in this department. I was just 
wondering." 

"Scooping sewage, probably. 
That's about his speed." The 
gray man shambled over to the 
control bench opposite and looked at the indicators. Then he 
lighted a cigarette. 



"Nothing in the hoppers?" the 
flabby one asked. 

"Nah. They ought to put Turk 
in the hoppers. He had metal in 
his goddam teeth. Actual metal!" 

"Turk wasn't old," the flabby 
one said reproachfully. "No more 
than sixty." 

"I never liked him." 

"First it was the kid — you 
know, Pimples. Then, lessee, the 
next one was that big guy, the 
realie actor — " 

"Gustad. The hell with him." 

"Yeah, Gustad. What I mean 
is, where do they go to? It's 
the same thing on my three-toseven shift, over in Yeasts. Guys 
I knew for ten, fifteen, twenty 
years on the same job. All of a 
sudden, they're gone and you 
never see them. Must be a hell 
of a thing, starting all over again 
somewhere else — guys like that — 
I mean you get set in your ways, 
kind of." 

His eyes were patient and bewildered in their watery pouches. 
"Guys like me — no kids, nobody 
that gives a damn about 'em. 
Kind of gives you the jumps to 
think about it. You know what 
I mean?" 

The gray one looked embarrassed, then irritated, then defiant. "Aah," he said, and produced 
a deck of cards from his kit — 
the grimy coating on the creaseless, frayless plastic as lovingly 
built and preserved as the patina

in a meerschaum. "Cut for deal. 
Come on! Let's play." 

"¥'11 have to know what you 
going to exhibit," the girl 
said. "For the Fair records." 

"Labor-saving devices," Alvah 
told her, "the latest and best 
products of human ingenuity, 
designed to—" 

"Machines," she said, writing. 
She added, looking up, "There's 
a fee for the use of the fairground 
space. Since you're only going to 
have it for a day, we'll call it 
twenty twains." 

Alvah hesitated. He had no 
idea what a twain might be — it 
had sounded like "twain." Evidently it was some sort of crude 
Muckfoot coinage. 

"Afraid I haven't got any of 
your money," he said, producing 
a handful of steels from his belt 
change-meter. "I don't suppose 
these would do?" 

The girl looked at him steadily. 
"Gold?" she said. "Precious 
stones, platinum, anything of 
that kind?" Alvah shook his head. 
"Sure?" Alvah shrugged despairingly. "Well," she said after a 
moment, "maybe something can 
be arranged. I'll let you talk to 
Doc about it, anyhow. He'll have 
to decide. Come on." 

"Just a minute," Alvah said, 
and ducked back into the floater. 
He found what he was looking 
for and trotted outside again. 



"What's that?" asked the girl, 
looking at the bulky kit at his 
waist. 

"Just a few things I like to 
have with me." 

"Mind showing me?" 

"Well — no." He opened the kit. 
"Cigarette lighter, flashlight, 
shaver, raincoat, heater, a few 
medicines over here, jujubes, 
food concentrates, things like 
that. Uh, I don't know why I 
put this in here — it's a distress 
signal for people who get lost 
in the subway." 

"You never can tell," said the 
girl, "when a thing like that will 
come in handy." 

"That's true. Uh, this thing 
that looks like two dumbbells 
and a corkscrew . . ." 

"Never mind," said the girl. 
"Come along." 

The first shed they passed was 
occupied by things that looked 
like turtles with glittery four-foot 
shells. In the nearest stall, a man 
was peeling off from one of the 
beasts successive thin layers of 
this shell-stuff, which turned out 
to be colorless and transparent. 
He passed them to a woman, who 
dipped them into a basin and 
then laid them on a board to dry. 
The ones at the far end of the 
row, Alvah noticed, had flattened 
into discs. 

The girl apparently misread 
his expression as curiosity. "Glass 
tortoise," she told him. "For win


24 




 



dows and so on. The young ones 
have more hump to their shells — 
almost spherical to start with. 
Those are for bottles and bowls 
and things." 

Alvah blinked noncommittally. 

ripHEY passed a counter on 
which metal tools were displayed — knives, axes and the like. 
Similar objects, Alvah noted automatically, had only approximately similar outlines. There 
seemed to be no standardization 
at all. 

"These are local," the girl said. 
"The metal comes from Iron Pits, 
just a few miles south of here." 

In the next shed was a long 
row of upright rectangular 
frames, most of them empty. One 
near the end, however, was filled 
with some sort of insubstantial 
film or fabric. A tiny scarlet creature was crawling rapidly up and 
down this gossamer substance, 
working its way gradually from 
left to right. 

"Squareweb," the girl informed 
him. "This dress I'm wearing was 
made that way." 

Alvah verified his previous impression that the dress was 
opaque. Rather a pity, since it 
was also quite handsomely filled 
out. Not, he assured himself, that 
it made any difference — the girl 
was a Muckfoot, after all. 

Next came a large cleared 
space. In it were half a dozen 



animals that resembled nothing 
in nature or nightmare except 
each other. They were wide and 
squat and at least six feet high 
at the shoulder. They had vaguely reptilian heads, and their scaly 
hides were patterned in orange 
and blue, rust and vermilion, yellow and poppy-red. 

The oddest thing about them, 
barring the fact that each had 
three sets of legs, was the extraordinary series of protuberances 
that sprouted from their backs. 
First came an upright, slightly 
hollow shield sort of thing, set 
crossways. behind the first pair of 
shoulders. Behind that, something that looked preposterously 
like an armchair — it even had a 
bright-colored cushion — and then 
a double row of upright spines 
with a wide space between them. 

"Trucks," said the girl. 

Alvah cleared his throat. 
"Look, Miss—" 

"Betty Jane Hofmeyer. Call 
me B. J. Everybody does." 

"All right — uh — B. J. I wonder 
if you could explain something 
to me. What's wrong with metal? 
And plastic, and things like that. 
I mean why should you people 
want to go to so much trouble 
and — and mess, when there are 
easier ways to do things better?" 

"Each," she said, "to his own 
taste. We turn here." 

A few yards ahead, the Fair 
ended and the settlement proper 



NATURAL STATE 



25 




began with an unusually large 
building — large enough, Alvah 
estimated, to fill almost an entire 
wing of a third-class hotel in New 
York. Unlike the hovels he had 
seen farther south — which looked 
as if they had been excreted — it 
was built of some regular, 
smooth-surfaced material, seamless and fairly well shaped. 

Alvah was so engrossed in these 
and other considerations that it 
wasn't until the girl turned three 
steps inside the doorway, impatiently waiting, that he realized 
a minor crisis was at hand — he 
was being invited to enter a 
Muckfoot dwelling. 

"Well, come on," said B. J. 



T9EFUSE any offers of food, 
transportation, etc., said the 
handbook, firmly, but as diplomatically as possible. Employ 
whatever subterfuge the situation may suggest, such as, 
"Thank you, but my doctor has 
forbidden me to touch fur," or, 
"Pardon me, but I have a sore 
throat and am unable to eat." 

Alvah cleared his throat frantically. The situation did not 
suggest anything at all. Luckily, 
however, his stomach did. 

"Maybe I'd better not come 
in," he said. "I don't feel very 
well. Maybe if I just sit down 
here quietly — " 

"You can sit down inside," 



26 




 



said the girl briskly. "If there's 
anything wrong with you, Doc 
will look you over." 

"Well," Alvah asked desperately, "couldn't you bring him out 
here for a minute? I really don't 
think—" 

"Doc is a busy man. Are you 
coming or not?" 

Alvah hesitated. There were, 
he told himself, only two possibilities, after all: (a) he would 
somehow manage to keep his 
breakfast, and (b) he wouldn't. 

The nausea began as a faint, 
premonitory twinge when he 
stepped through the doorway. It 
increased steadily as he followed 
B. J. past cages rilled with things 
that chirruped, croaked, rumbled, 
rustled or simply stared at him. 
The girl didn't invite comment 
on any of them, for which Alvah 
was grateful. He was too busy 
concentrating on trying not to 
concentrate on his misery. . 

For the same reason, he did 
not notice at what precise point 
the cages gave way to long rows 
of potted green plants. Alvah was 
just beginning to wonder if he 
would live to see the end of them 
when, still following B. J., he 
turned a corner and came upon a 
cleared space with half a dozen 
people in it. 

One of them was the sad-faced 
youth, Artie. Another was a 
stocky man, all chest and paunch 
and no neck at all, who was talk


ing to Artie while the others 
stood and listened. B. J. stopped 
and waited quietly. Alvah, perforce, did the same. 

" — just a few seedlings and a 
couple of one-year-olds for now 
— we'll see how they go. If you 
have more room later on . . . 
What else was I going to tell 
you?" The stocky man rumpled^ 
his hair nervously. "Oh, look, 
Artie, I had a copy of the specifications for you, but the fool bird 
got into a fight with a mirror and 
broke his . . . Wait a second." 
He turned abruptly. "Hello, Beej. 
Come along to the library for a 
second, will you?" 

He turned again and strode off, 
with Artie, B. J. and Alvah in his 
wake. 

'T'HE room they entered was, 
from Alvah's point of view, 
the worst he had struck yet. It 
was a hundred feet long by fifty 
wide, and everywhere — perched 
on the walls and on multi-leveled 
racks that ran the length of the 
room, darting through the air in 
flutters of brilliance — were tiny 
raucous birds, feathered in every 
prismatic shade, green, electricblue, violet, screaming red. 

"Mark seven one-oh-three!" 
Bither shouted. The roomful of 
birds took it up in a hideous 
echoing chorus. An instant later, 
a sudden flapping sound turned 
itself into an explosion of color 



NATURAL STATE 



27 



and alighted on the stocky man's 
shoulder, preening its feathers 
with a blunt green beak. "Rrk," it 
said and then, quite clearly, 
"Mark seven one-oh-three." 

The stocky man made a perch 
of one forefinger and handed the 
thing across to Artie's shoulder. 
"I can't give you this one. It's 
the only copy I got. You'll have 
to listen to it and remember what 
you need." 

"I'll remember." Artie glanced 
at the bird on his shoulder and 
said, "Magnus utility tree." 

The stocky man looked around, 
saw B. J. "Now, Beej, is it important? Because — " 

"Magnus utility tree," the bird 
was saying. "Thrives in all soils, 
over ninety-one per cent resistant 
to most rusts, scales and other infestations. Edible from root to 
branch. Young shoots and leaves 
excellent for salads. Self-fertilizing. Sap can be drawn in second 
year for — " 

"Doc," said the girl clearly, 
"this is Alvah Gustad. From New 
York. Alvah, meet Doc Bither." 

" — golden orangoes in spring 
and early summer, Bither aperries in late summer and fall. Will 
crossbreed with — " 

"New York, huh?" said Bither. 
"You a long way from home, 
young — Excuse me. Artie?" 

" — series five to one hundred fifteen. Trunks guaranteed 
straight and rectilinear, two-by


four at end of second year, fourby-six at — " 

"I all set, Doc." 

" — mealie pods and winterberries — " 

"Fine, all right." He took B. 
J.'s arm. "Let's go someplace we 
can talk." 

^ — absorb fireproofing and 
stiffening solutions freely through 
roots . . ." 

TMTHER led the way into a 
small, crowded room. "Now," 
he said, peering intently at Alvah, 
"what's the problem?" 

B. J. explained briefly. Then 
they both stared at Alvah. Sweat 
was beaded coldly on his brow 
and his knees were tremblingrbut 
he seemed to have stabilized the 
nausea just below the critical 
point. The idea, he told himself, 
was to convince yourself that the 
whole building was a realie stage 
and .all the objects in it props. 
Wasn't there a lrne to that effect 
in one of the classics — The Manager of Copenhagen, or perhaps 
Have It Your Own Way? 

"What do you think?" Bither 
asked. 

"Might try him out." 

"Urn. Damn it, I wish we 
hadn't run out of birds. Can you 
take this down for me, Beej? 
I'll arrange for the Fair rental 
fee, Alvah, if you just answer a 
few questions." 

It sounded innocuous enough, 



28 




 



but Alvah felt a twinge of suspicion. "What kind of questions?" 

"Just personal questions, like 
how old, what you do for a living." 

"Twenty-six. I'm an actor." 
"Always been an actor?" 
"No." 

"What else you done?" 
"Labor." 

"What kind?" B. J. asked. 

"Worked with his hands, he 
means," Bither told her. "Parents 
laborers, too?" 

"Yes." 

B. J. and Bither exchanged 
glances. Alvah shifted uncomfortably. "If that's all . . ." 

"One or two more. I want you 
to tell me, near as you can, when 
was the first time you remember 
knowing that our clothes and our 
animals and us and all the things 
we make smelled bad?" 

It was too much. Alvah turned 
and lurched blindly out the door. 
He heard their voices behind him : 

"... minutes." 

"... alley door!" 

Then there were hands on him, 
steering him from behind as he 
stumbled forward at a half-run. 
They turned him right, then left 
and finally he was out in the cool 
air, not a moment too soon. 

When he straightened, wiping 
tears away, he was alone, but a 
moment later the girl appeared 
in the doorway. 

"That's all," she said distantly. 



"You can start your exhibition 
whenever you want." 

IV 

fXiHE magic tricks went over 
fairly well — at least nobody 
yawned. The comic monologue, 
however, was a flat failure, even 
though the piece had been expertly slanted for a rural audience and, by all the laws of psychostatics, should have rated at 
least half a dozen boffs. ("So the 
little boy came moseying back 
up the road, and his grandpa said 
to him, 'Why didn't you drive 
them hogs out of the corn like I 
told you?' And the little fellow 
piped up, 'Them ain't hogs — 
them's shoats!' ") 

Alvah launched hopefully into 
his sales talks and demonstrations. 

The all-purpose fireless lifetime cooker was received with 
blank stares. When Alvah fried 
up a savory batch of proteinpaste fritters and offered to hand 
them out, nobody responded but 
one small boy, and his mother 
hauled him down off the platform stair by the slack of his 
pants. 

Smiling doggedly, Alvah 
brought out the pocket-workshop 
power tools and accessories. This, 
it appeared, was more like it. An 
interested hum went up as he 
drilled three holes of various sizes

in a bar of duroplast, then sawed 
through it from end to end and 
finally cut a mortise in one piece, 
a tenon in the other, and fitted 
them together. A few more people drifted in. 

"And now, friends," said Alvah, "if you'll continue to give 
me your kind attention . . ." 

The next item was the little 
giant power-plant for the home, 
shop or office. Blank stares again. 
Alvah picked out one Muckfoot 
in the front row — a blear-eyed, 
open-mouthed fellow, with hair 
over his forehead and a basket 
under his arm, who seemed typical — and spoke directly to him. 
He outdid himself about the safety, economy, efficiency and unobtrusiveness of a little giant 
power-plant. He explained its 
operation in words a backward 
two-year-old could understand. 

"A little giant," he concluded, 
leaning over the platform rail to 
stare hypnotically into the Muckfoot's eyes, "is the power-plant 
for you!" 

The fellow blinked, slowly produced a dark-brown lump of 
something from his pocket, slowly put it into his inattentive 
mouth, and as slowly began to 
chew. 

Alvah breathed deeply and 
clutched the rail. "And now," he 
said, giving the clincher, "the 
marvel of the age — the superspeed runabout!" He pressed the 



button that popped open a segment of the floater's hull and 
lowered the gleaming little twowheeled car into view. 

"Now, friends," he said, "just 
to demonstrate the amazing qualities of this miracle of modern 
science — is there- any gentleman 
in the crowd who has an animal 
he fancies for speed?" 

"C'OR the first time, the Muck■■- feet reacted according to the 
charts. Shouts rocketed up: "Me, 
by damn!" "Me!" "Right here, 
mister!" "Yes, sir!" 

"Friends, friends!" said Alvah, 
spreading his hands. "There 
won't be time to accommodate 
you all. Choose one of you to 
represent the rest!" 

"Switty!" somebody yelped, 
and other voices took up the cry. 
A red-haired young man began 
working his way back out of the 
crowd, propelled by gleeful 
shouts and slaps on the back. 

Alvah took an indicator and 
began pointing out the salient 
features of the runabout. He had 
not got more than a quarter of 
the way through when the redhead reappeared, mounted astride 
an animal which, to Alvah's revolted gaze, looked to be part 
horse, part lynx, part camel and 
part pure horror. 

To the crowd, evidently, it was 
one of nature's finest efforts. Alvah swallowed bile and raised his 



30 




 



voice again. "Clear a space now, 
friends — all the way around!" 

It took time, but eventually 
self-appointed deputies began to 
get the crowd moving. Alvah descended, carrying two bright 
marker poles, and, followed by 
the inquisitive redhead, set one 
up at either side of the enclosure, 
a few yards short of the boundary. 

"This will be the course," he 




NATURAL STATE 



told Swifty. "Around these markers and the floater — that thing I 
was standing on. We'll do ten 
laps, starting and finishing here. 
Is that all right?" 

"All right with me," said the 
redhead, grinning more widely 
than before. 

There were self-appointed 
time-keepers and starters, too. 
When Alvah, in the runabout, 
and the redhead, on his monster, 
were satisfactorily lined up, one 
of them bellowed, "On y' marks 
— Git set . . ." and then cracked 
a short whip with a noise out of 
all proportion to its size. 

For a moment, Alvah thought 
Swifty and his horrid mount had 
simply disappeared. Then he 
spotted them, diminished by perspective, halfway down the 
course, and rapidly getting smaller. He slammed the power bar 
over and took off in pursuit. 

A ROUND the first turn, it was 
Swifty, with Alvah nowhere. 
In the stretch, Alvah was coming 
up fast on the outside. Around 
the far turn, he was two monster 
lengths behind and, in the stretch 
again, they were neck and neck. 
Alvah kept it that way for the 
next two laps and then gradually 
pulled ahead. The crowd became 
a multicolored streak, whirling 
past him. In the sixth lap, he 
passed Swifty again — in the 
eighth, again — in the tenth, still 

31 



again — and when he skidded to a 
halt beyond the finish post, fluttering its flags with the wind of 
his passage, poor old Swifty and 
his steaming beast were still lumbering halfway down the stretch. 

"Now, friends," said Alvah, triumphantly mounting the platform again, "in a moment, I'm 
going to tell you how you, yourselves, can own this wonderful 
runabout and many marvels more 
— but first, are there any questions you'd like to ask?" 

Swifty pushed forward, grinless, looking like a man smitten 
by lightning. "How many to a 
get?" he called. 

Alvah decided he must have 
misunderstood. "You can have 
any number you want," he said. 
"The price is so reasonable — but 
I'm going to come to that in a — " 

"I don't mean how many will 
you sell. How many to a get?" 
Alvah looked blank. "How many 
calves, or colts, or whatever, is 
what I want to know." 

There was a general murmur 
of agreement. This, it would 
seem, was what everybody wanted to know. 

Appalled, Alvah corrected the 
misapprehension as quickly and 
clearly as he could. 

"Mean to say," somebody called, "they don't breed?" 

"Certainly not. If one of them 
ever breaks down — and, friends, 
they're built to last — you get it 



repaired or buy another." 

"How much?" somebody in 
the crowd yelled. 

"Friends, I'm not here to take 
your money," Alvah said. "We 
just want — " 

"Then how we going to pay 
for your stuff?" 

"I'm coming to that. When two 
people want to trade, friends, 
there's usually a way. You want 
our products. We want metals — 
iron, aluminum, chromium — " 

"Suppose a man ain't got any 
metal?" 

"Well, sir, there are a lot of 
other things we can use besides 
metal. Natural fruits and vegetables, for instance." 

The slack-faced yokel in the 
first row, the one with the basket 
under his arm, roused himself for 
the first time. His mouth closed, 
then opened again. "What kind?" 

"Natural products, friend. You 
know, the kind your great-granddad ate. We use a lot every year 
for table delicacies, even — " 

The yokel came halfway up 
the platform stair. His gnarled 
fingers dipped into the basket 
and came up with a smooth redgold ovoid. He shoved it toward 
Alvah. "You mean," he said incredulously, "you wouldn' eat 
that?" 

ULPING, Alvah backed away 
a step. The Muckfoot came 
after him. "Raise 'em myself," 



32 




 



he said plaintively, holding out 
the red fruit. "I tell you, they're 
just the juiciest, goodest — Go 
ahead, try one." 

"I'm not hungry," Alvah said 
desperately. "I'm on a diet. Now 
if you'll just step down quietly, 
friend, till after the—" 

The Muckfoot stared at him, 
holding the fruit under Alvah's 
nose. "You mean you won't fry 
it?" 

"No," said Alvah, trying not 
to breathe. "Now go on back 
down there, friend— don't crowd 
me." 

"Well," said the Muckfoot, 
"then durn you!" And he shoved 
the disgusting thing squashily into Alvah's face. 

Alvah saw red. Blinking away 
a glutinous film of juice and pulp, 
he glimpsed the yokel's face, 
spread into a hideous grin. Waves 
of laughter beat about his ears. 
Retching, he brought up his right 
fist in an instinctive roundhouse 
swing that clapped the yokel's 
grin shut and toppled him over 
the platform rail, basket, flying 
fruit and all. 

The laughter rumbled away into expectant silence. Alvah fumbled in his kit for tissues, scrubbed a wad of them across his 
face and saw them come away 
daubed with streaky red. He 
hurled them convulsively into 
the crowd and, leaning over the 
rail, shouted thickly, "Lousy 

NATURAL STATE 



stinking filthy Muckfeet!" 

Muckfoot men in the front 
ranks turned and looked at each 
other solemnly. Then two of 
them marched up the platform 
stair and, behind them, another 
two. 

Still berserk, Alvah met the 
first couple with two violent kicks 
in the chest. This cleared the 
stair, but he turned to find three 
more candidates swarming over 
the rail. He swung at the nearest, 
who ducked. The next one seized 
Alvah's arm with both hands and 
toppled over backward. Alvah 
followed, head foremost, and 
landed with a jar that shook him 
to his toes. 

The next thing he knew, he was 
lying on the ground surrounded 
by upward of twenty thick seamless boots, choking on dust, and 
getting the daylights methodically kicked out of him. 

Alvah rolled over frantically, 
climbed the first leg that came 
to hand, got his back against the 
platform and, by flint of cracking 
skulls together, managed in two 
brisk minutes to clear a momentary space around him. Another 
dim figure lunged at him. Alvah 
clouted it under the ear, whirled 
and vaulted over the rail onto the 
platform. 

His gun popped out into his 
hand. 

For just a moment, he was 
standing alone, feeling the pistol 

33 



grip clenched hard in his dirtcaked palm and able to judge 
exactly how long he had before 
half a dozen Muckfeet would 
swarm up the stair and over the 
rail. The crowd's faces were sharp 
and clear. He saw Artie and Doc 
Bither and Jake, his mouth open 
to howl, and he saw the girl, B. J., 
in a curious posture — leaning forward, her right arm thrust out 
and down. She had just thrown 
something at him. 

A LVAH saw the gray-white 
blur wobbling toward him. 
He tried to dodge, but the thing 
struck his shoulder and exploded 
with a papery pop. For a bewildering instant, the air was full 
of dancing bright particles. Then 
they were gone. 

Alvah didn't have time to wonder about it. He thumbed the 
selector over to Explosive, pointed the gun straight up and 
squeezed the trigger. 

Nothing happened. 

There were two Muckfeet half 
over the rail and three more coming up the stair. Incredulous, still 
aiming at the air, Alvah tried 
again — and again. The gun didn't 
work. 

Three Muckfeet were on the 
platform, four more right behind 
them. Alvah spun through the 
open door and slapped at the 
control button. The door stayed 
open. 



The Muckfeet were massed in 
the doorway, staring in like visitors at an aquarium. Alvah dived 
at the power bar, shoved it over. 
The floater didn't lift. 

"Holly! Luke!" called a clear 
voice outside, and the Muckfeet 
turned. "Leave him alone. He's 
got enough troubles now." 

Alvah was pawing at the control board. 

The lights didn't work. 

The air - conditioner didn't 
work. 

The scent-organ didn't work. 

The musivox didn't work. 

One of the Muckfeet put his 
head in at the door. "Reckon he 
has," he said thoughtfully and 
went away again. Alvah heard 
his voice, more faintly. "You do 
something, B. J.?" 

"Yes," said the girl, "I did 
something." 

ll/|"OVING warily, Alvah went 
outside. The girl was standing just below the platform, 
watching as the Muckfoot men 
filed down the stair. 

"You!" he said to her. 

She paid him no attention. 
"Just one of those things, Luke," 
she said. 

Luke nodded solemnly. "Well, 
the Fair don't come but once a 
year." He and the other men 
moved past her into the crowd, 
each one acquiring a train of 
curiosity-seekers as he went. The 



34 




 



crowd began to drift away. 

A familiar voice yelped, 
"Ride'm out on a razorback is 
what / say!" 

A chorus of "Now, Jake!" went 
up. There were murmurs of dissent, of inquiry, of explanation. 
"Time for the poultry judging!" 
somebody called, and the crowd 
moved faster. 

Alvah went dazedly down and 
climbed into the runabout. He 
waggled its power bar. No response. 

He tore open his kit and began 
frantically hauling out one glittery object after another, holding 
each for an instant and then 
throwing it on the ground. The 
' razor, the heater, the vacuum 
cleaner, the sonotube, the vibromasseur. 

Swifty rode by, at ease atop 
his horse-lynx-camel-horror. He 
was whistling. 

The crowd was almost gone. 
Among the stragglers was Jake, 
fists on his pudgy hips, his choleric cheeks gleaming with sweat 
and satisfaction. 

"Well, Mister High-andMighty," he called, "what are 
you going to do now?" 

That was just what Alvah was 
wondering. He was about a thousand miles from home by air — 
probably more like fifteen hundred across-country. He had no 
transportation, no shelter, no 
power tools, no equipment. He 



had, he realized with horror, been 
cut off instantly from everything 
that made a man civilized. 
What was he going to do? 

V .. 

Tl/JANAGER Wytak had his 
feet on the glossy desktop. 
So did the Comptroller, narrowfaced old Mr. Creedy; the Director of Information, plump Mr. 
Kling; the Commissioner of Supply, blotched and pimpled Mr. 
Jackson; and the porcine Mr. 
McArdle, Commissioner of War. 
With chairs tilted back, they 
stared through a haze of cigar 
smoke at each others' stolid faces 
mirrored on the ceiling. 

Wytak's voice was as confident 
as ever, if a trifle muted, and 
when the others spoke, he listened. These were not the hired nonentities Alvah had seen; these 
were the men who had made 
Wytak, the electorate with whose 
consent he governed. 

"Jack," said Wytak, "I want 
you to look at it my way and 
see if you don't think I'm right. 
It isn't a question of how long 
we can hold out — when you get 
right down and look at it, it's a 
question of can we do anything." 

"In time," said Jackson expressionlessly. 

"In time. But if we can do 
anything, there'll be time enough. 
You say we've got troubles now 



NATURAL STATE 



35 



and you're right, but I tell you 
we can pull through a situation a 
thousand times worse than this — 
if we've got an answer. And have 
we got an answer? We have." 

Creedy grunted. "Like to see 
some results, Boley." 

"You'll see them. You can't 
skim a yeast tank the first day, 
Will." 

"You can see the bubbles, 
though," said Jackson sourly. 
"Any report from this Gustad 
today, while we're talking about 
it?" 

"Not yet. He was getting some 
response yesterday. He's following it up. I trust that boy — the 
analyzers picked his card out of 
five million. Wait and see. He'll 
deliver." 

"If you say so, Boley." 

"I say so." 

Jackson nodded. "That's good 
enough. Gentlemen?" 

TN another soundproof, spyproof office in Over Manhattan, Kling and McArdle met 
again twenty minutes later. 

"What do you think?" asked 
Kling with his meaningless smile. 

"Moderately good. I was hoping he would lie about Gustad's 
report, but of course there was 
very little chance of that. Wytak 
is an old hand." 

"You admire him?" Kling suggested. 

"As a specimen of his type. 



Wytak pulled us out of a very 
bad spot in '39." 
"Agreed." 

"And he has had his uses since 
then. There are times when brilliant improvisation is better than 
sound principles — and times 
when it is not. Wytak is an incurable romantic." 

"And you?" 

"We," said McArdle grimly, 
"are realists." 

"Oh, yes. But perhaps we are 
not anything just yet. Creedy is 
interested, but not convinced — 
and until he moves, Jackson will 
do nothing." 

"Wytak's project is a failure. 
You can't do business with the 
Muckfeet. But the fool was so 
confident that he didn't even interfere with Gustad's briefing." 

Kling leaned forward with interest. "You didn't . . .?" 

"No. It wasn't necessary. But 
it means that Gustad has no instructions to fake successful reports — and that means Wytak 
can't stall until he gets back. 
There was no report today. Suppose there's none tomorrow, or 
the next day, or the next." 

"In that case, of course . . . 
However, it's always as well to 
offer something positive. You said 
you might have something to 
show me today." 

"Yes. Follow me." 

In a sealed room at the end of 
a guarded corridor, five young 



36 




 



men were sitting. They leaped to 
attention when Kling and McArdle entered. 

"At ease," said McArdle. "This 
gentleman is going to ask you 
some questions. You may answer 
freely." He turned to Kling. "Go 
ahead — ask them anything." 

Kling's eyebrows went up delicately, but he looked the young 
men over, selected one and said, 
"Your name?" 

"Walter B. Limler, sir." 

Kling looked mildly pained. 
"Please don't call me sir. Where 
do you live?" 

"CFF Barracks, Tier Three, 
McCormick." 

"CFF?" said Kling with a 
frown. "McCormick? I don't 
place the district. Where is it?" 

The young man, who was 
blond and very earnest, allowed 
himself to show a slight surprise. 
"In the Loop," he said. 

"And where is the Loop?" 

The young man looked definitely startled. He glanced at 
McArdle, moistened his lips and 
said, "Well, right here, sir. In 
Chicago." 

Kling's eyebrows went up and 
then down. He smiled. "I begin 
to see," he murmured to McArdle. "Very clever." 

TT cost Alvah two hours' labor, 
using tools that had never 
been designed to be operated 
manually, to get the inspection 



plate off the motor housing in the 
floater. He compared the intricate mechanism with the diagrams and photographs in the 
maintenance handbook. He looked for dust and grime; he checked 
the moving parts for play; he 
probed for dislodged wiring plates 
and corrosion. He did everything 
the handbook suggested, even 
spun the flywheel and was positive he felt the floater lift a fraction of an inch beneath him. As 
far as he could tell, there was 
absolutely nothing wrong, unless 
the trouble was in the core of 
the motor itself — the force-field 
that rotated the axle that made 
everything go. 

The core casing had an "easily 
removable" segment, meaning to 
say that Alvah was able to get 
it off in three hours more. 

Inside, there was no resistance 
to his cautious finger. The spoolshaped hollow space was empty. 

Under Motor Force-field Inoperative the manual said simply: Remove and replace rhodopalladium nodules. 

Alvah looked. He found the 
tiny sockets where the nodules 
ought to be, one in the flanged 
axle-head, the other facing it at 
the opposite end of the chamber. 
The nodules were not there at 
all. 

Alvah went into the storage 
chamber. Ignoring the increasingly forceful protests of his emp


NATURAl STATE 



37 



ty stomach, he spent a furious 
twenty minutes locating the spare 
nodules. He stripped the seal off 
the box and lifted the lid with 
great care. 

There were the nodules. And 
there, appearing out of nowhere, 
was a whirling cloud of brightness that settled briefly in the 
box and then went back where it 
came from. And there the nodules 
were gone. 

Alva stared at the empty box. 
He poked his forefinger into the 
cushioned niches, one after the 
other. Then he set the box down 
with care, about-faced, walked 
outside to the platform and sat 
down on the top step with his 
chin on his fists. 

"You look peaked," said B. J.'s 
firm voice. 

Alvah looked up at her briefly. 
"Go away." 

"Had anything to eat today?" 
the girl asked. 

Alvah did not reply. 

"Don't sulk," she said. "You've 
got a problem. We feel responsible. Maybe there's something 
we can do to help." 

Alvah stood up slowly. He 
looked her over carefully, from 
top to bottom and back again. 
"There is one thing you could 
do for me," he said. "Smile." 

"Why?" she asked cagily. 

"I wanted to see your fangs." 
He turned wearily and went into 
the floater. 



TIE puttered around for a few 
minutes, then got cold rations out of the storage chamber 
and sat down in the control chair 
to eat them. But the place was 
odious to him with its gleaming, 
useless array of gadgetry, and 
he went outside again and sat 
down with his back to the hull 
near the doorway. The girl was 
still there, looking up at him. 

"Look," she said, "I'm sorry 
about this." 

The nutloaf went down his 
gullet in one solid lump and hit 
his stomach like a stone. "Please 
don't mention it," he said bitterly. "It was really nothing at 
all." 

"I had to do it. You might 
have killed somebody." 

Alvah tried another bite. Chewing the stuff, at any rate, gave 
him something to do. "What 
were those things?" he demanded. 

"Metallophage," she said. 
"They eat metals in the platinum 
family. Hard to get them that 
selective — we weren't exactly sure 
what would happen." 

Alvah put down the remnant 
of nutloaf slowly. "Who's 'we'? 
You and Bither?" 

"Mostly." 

"And you — you bred those 
things to eat rhodopalladium?" 
She nodded. 

"Then you must have some to 
feed them," said Alvah logically. 
He stood up and gripped the 



38 




 



railing. "Give it to me." 

She hesitated. "There might be 
some — " 

"Might be? There musr be!" 

"You don't understand. They 
don't actually eat the metal — not 
for nourishment, that is." 

"Then what do they do with 
it?" 

"They build nests," she told 
him. "But come on over to the 
lab and we'll see." 

At the laboratory door, they 
were still arguing. "For the last 
time," said Alvah, "I will not 
come in. I've just eaten half a 
nutcake and I haven't got food 
to waste. Get the stuff and bring 
it out." 

"For the last time," said B. J., 
"get it out of your head that what 
you want is all that counts. If 
you want me to look for the 
metal, you'll come in, and that's 
flat." 

They glared at each other. 
Well, he told himself resignedly, 
he hadn't wanted that nutloaf 
much in the first place. 

They followed the same route, 
past the things that chirruped, 
croaked, rumbled, rustled. The 
main thing, he recalled, was to 
keep your mind off it. 

"Tell me something," he said 
to her trim back. "If I hadn't 
got myself mixed up with that 
farmer and his market basket, 
do you still think I wouldn't have 
sold anything?" 



"That's right." 

"Well, why not? Why all this 
resistance to machinery? Is it 
a taboo of some kind?" 

SHE said nothing for a moment. 
"Is it because you're afraid 
the Cities will get a hold on you?" 
Alvah insisted. "Because that's 
foolish. Our interests are really 
the same as yours. We don't just 
want to sell you stuff — we want' 
to help you help yourselves. The 
more prosperous you get, the better for us." 

"It's not that," she said. 
"Well, what then? It's been 
bothering me. You've got all 
these raw materials, all this land. 
You wouldn't have to wait for 
us — you could have built your 
own factories, made your own 
machines. But you never have. 
I can't understand why." 

"It's not worth the trouble." 
He choked. "Anything is worth 
the trouble, if it helps you do the 
same work more efficiently, more 
intel— " 

"Wait a minute." She stopped 
a woman who was passing in the 
aisle between the cages. "Marge, 
where's Doc?" 

"Down in roundworms, I 
think." 

"Tell him I have to see him, 
will you? It's urgent. We'll wait 
in here." She led the way into a 
windowless room, as small and 
cluttered as any Alvah had seen. 



NATURAL STATE 



39 



"Now," she said. "We don't 
make a fuss about machines because most people simply haven't 
any need for them." 

"That's ridiculous," Alvah argued. "You may think — " 

"Be quiet and let me finish. 
We haven't got centralized industries or power installations. 
Why do you think the Cities have 
never beaten us in a war, as often 
as they've tried? Why do you 
think we've taken over the whole 
world, except for Wenty-two 
Cities? You've got to face this 
sooner or later — in every single 
respect, our plants and animals 
are more efficient than any machine you could build." 

Alvah inspected her closely. 
Her eyes were intent and brilliant. Her bosom indicated deep 
and steady breathing. To all appearance, she was perfectly serious. 

"Nuts," he replied with dignity. 

¥> ¥ shook her head impa•«! • tiently. "I know you've 
got a brain. Use it. What's the 
most expensive item that goes 
into a machine?" 

"Metal. We're a little short of 
it, to tell the truth." 

"Think again. What are all 
« your gadgets supposed to save?" 

"Well, labor." 

"Human labor. If metal is expensive, it's because it costs a lot 
of man-hours." 



"If you want to look at it that 
way — " 

"It's true, isn't it? Why is a 
complicated thing more expensive 
than a simple one? More manhours to make it. Why is a rare 
thing more expensive than a common one? More man-hours to 
find it. Why is a — " 

"All right, what's your point?" 

"Take your runabout. You saw 
that was the thing that interested 
people most, but I'll show you 
why you never could have sold 
one. How many man-hours went 
into manufacturing it?" 

Alvah shifted restlessly. "It 
isn't in production. It's a trade 
item." 

She sniffed. "Suppose it was 
in production. Make an honest 
guess. Figure in everything — 
amortization on the plant and 
equipment, materials, labor and 
so on. You can check your answer against wages and prices 
in your own money — you'll come 
pretty close." 

Alvah reflected. "Between seven-fifty and a thousand." 

"Compare that with Swifty's 
Morgan Gamma — the thing you 
raced against. Two man-hours — 
just two, and I'm being generous." 

"Interesting," said Alvah, "if 
true." He suppressed an uneasy 
belch. 

"Figure it out. An hour for the 
vet when he was foaled. Call it

another hour for amortization on 
the stable where it happened, but 
that's too much. It isn't hard to 
grow a stable and they last a 
long time." 

Alvah, who had been holding 
his own as long as machines were 
the topic, wasn't sure he could 
keep it up — or, more correctly, 
down. "All right, two hours," he 
said. "The animals feed themselves and water themselves, no 
doubt." 

"They do, but that comes under upkeep. Our animals forage, 
most of them — all the big ones. 
The rest are cheap and easy to 
feed. Your machines have to be 
fueled. Our animals repair themselves, like any living organism, 
only better and faster. Your machines have to be repaired and 
serviced. More man-hours. Incidentally, if you and Swifty took 
a ten-hour trip, you in your runabout, him on his Morgan, you'd 
spend just ten hours steering. 
Swifty would spend maybe fifteen minutes all told. And now 
we come to the payoff — " 

"Some other time," said Alvah irritably. 

"This is important. When your 
runabout — " 

"I'd rather not talk about it 
any more," said Alvah, raising 
his voice. "Do you mind?" 

"When your runabout breaks 
down and can't be fixed," she 
said firmly, "you have to buy 



another. Swifty's mare drops 
twins every year. There. Think 
about it." 

'T'HE door opened and Bither 
came in, looking more disheveled than ever. "Hello, Beej, Alvah. Beej, I think we shoulda 
used annelid stock for this job. 
These F 3 batches no good at — 
you two arguing?" 

Alvah recovered himself with 
an effort. "Rhodopalladium," he 
said thickly. "I need about a 
gram. Have you got it?" 

"Not a scrap," said Bither 
cheerfully. "Except in the nests, 
of course." 

"I told him I didn't think so," 
B. J. said. 

Alvah closed his eyes for a 
second. "Where," he asked carefully, "are the nests?" 

"Wish I knew," Bither admitted. "It's frustrating as hell. You 
see, we had to make them awful 
small and quick, the metallophage. Once you let them out of 
the sacs, there's no holding them. 
We did so good a job, we can't 
check to see how good a job we 
did." He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Of course, that's beside 
the point. Even if we had the 
metals, how would you get the 
alloy you need?" 

"Palladium," said the girl, 
"melts at fifteen fifty-three Centigrade. I asked the hand bird." 

"Best we can get out of a sala

mander is about six hundred," 
Bither added. "Isn't good for 
them, either — they get esophagitis." 

"And necrosis," the girl said, 
watching Alvah intently. 

His eyes were watering. It was 
hard to see. "Are you telling — " 

"We're trying to tell you," she 
said, "that you can't go back. 
You've got to start getting used 
to the idea. There isn't a thing 
you can do except settle down 
here and learn to live with us." 

Alvah could feel his jaw working, but no words were coming 
out. The bulge of nausea in his 
middle was squeezing its way inexorably upward. 

Somebody grabbed his arm. 
"In there!" said Bither urgently. 

A door opened and closed behind him, and he found himself 
facing a hideous white-porcelain 
antique with a pool of water in 
it. There was a roaring in his 



ears, but before the first spasm 
took him, he could hear the girl's 
and Bither's voices faintly from 
the other room: 

"Eight minutes that time." 

"Beej, I don't know." 

"We can do it!" 

"Well, I suppose we can, but 
can we do it before he starves?" 

There was a sink in the room, 
but Alvah would sooner have 
drunk poison. He fumbled in his 
disordered kit until he found the 
condenser canteen. He rinsed out 
his mouth, took a tonus capsule 
and a mint lozenge. He opened 
the door. 

"Feeling better?" asked the 
girl. 

Alvah stared at her, retched 
feebly and fled back into the 
washroom. 

WHEN he came out again, 
Bither said, "He's had 
enough, Beej. Let's take him out

in the courtyard till he gets his 
strength back." , 

They moved toward him. Alvah said weakly, but with feeling, 
"Keep your itchy hands off me." 
He walked unsteadily past them, 
turned when he reached the doorway. "I hate to urp and run, but 
I'll never forget your hospitality. 
If there's ever anything I can do 
for you — anything at all — please 
hesitate to call on me." 

He heard muttering voices and 
an odd scraping sound behind 
him, but he didn't look back. He 
was halfway down the aisle between the cages when something 
furry and gray scuttled into view 
and sat up, grinning at him. 

It looked like an ordinary capuchin monkey except for its 
head, which was grotesquely 
large. "Go away," said Alvah. He 
advanced with threatening gestures. The thing chattered at him 
and stayed where it was. 



The aisle behind him was deserted. Very well, there were other 
exits. Alvah followed his nose 
back into the plant section and 
turned right. 

There was the monkey-thing 
again. 

At the next intersection of 
aisles, there were two of them. 
Alvah turned left. 

And right. 

And left. 

And emerged into a large empty space enclosed by buildings. 

"This is the courtyard," said 
Bither, coming forward with the 
girl behind him. "Now be reasonable, Alvah. You want to get 
back to New York, don't you?" 

This did not seem to call for 
comment. Alvah stared at him in 
silence. 

"Well," said Bither, "there's 
just one way you can do it. It 
won't be easy — I don't even say 
you got more than a fighting

chance. One thing, though — it's 
up to you just how hard you 
make it for yourself." 

"Get to the point," Alvah said. 

"You got to let us decondition 
you so you can eat our food, ride 
on our animals. Now think about 
it, don't just — " 

Alvah swung around, looking 
for the fastest and most direct 
exit. Before he had time to find 
it, a dizzying thought struck him 
and he turned back. 

"Is that what this whole thing 
has been about?" he challenged. 
He glared at Bither, then at B. J. 
"Is that the reason you were so 
helpful? Did you engineer that 
fight?" 

"OITHER clucked unhappily. 
" "Would we admit it if we 
did? Alvah, I'll admit this much 
— of course we interested in you 
for our own reasons. This is the 
first time in thirty years we had 
a chance to study a City man. 
But what I just told you is true. 
If you want to get back home, 
this is your only chance." 

"Then I'm a dead man," said 
Alvah. 

"You is if you think you is," 
Bither told him. "Beej, you try." 

She looked at Alvah levelly. 
"You think what we suggesting 
isn't possible. Right?" 

"Discounting Doc's grammar," 
Alvah said sourly, "that's exactly 
what I'm thinking." 



She said, "Doc's grammar is all 
right — yours is sixty years out 
of date. But I guess you already 
realize that your people are backward compared to us." 

Half angry, half curious, Alvah 
demanded, "Just how do you figure that?" 

"Easy. You probably don't 
know much biology, but you 
must know this much. What's 
the one quality that makes human beings the dominant race on 
this planet?" 

Alvah snorted. "Are you trying 
to tell me I'm not as bright as a 
Muckfoot?" 

"Not intelligence. Try again. 
Something more general — intelligence is only a special phase of 
it." 

Alvah's patience was narrowing to a thin and brittle thread. 
"You tell me." 

"All right. We like to think 
intelligence is important, but you 
can't argue that way. It's special 
pleading — the way a whale might 
argue that size is the measuring 
stick, or a microbe might say 
numbers. But — " 

"Control of environment," Alvah said. 

"Right. Another name for it is 
adaptability. No other organism 
is so independent of environment, 
so adaptable as Man. And we 
could live in New York if we 
had to, just as we can live in the 
Arctic Circle or the tropics. And,

since you don't dare even try to 
live here . . ." 

"All right," Alvah said bitterly. 
"When do we start?" 

VI 

TIE refused to be hypnotized. 

"You promised to help," 
B. J. said in annoyance. "We 
can't break the conditioning till 
we find out how it was done, you 
big oaf!" 

"The whole thing is ridiculous 
anyhow," Alvah pointed out. "I 
said I'd let you try and I will — 
you can prod me around to your 
heart's content — but not that. 
I've put in a lot of Required 
Contribution time in restricted 
laboratories. Military secrets. 
How do I know you wouldn't ask 
me about those if you got me 
under?" 

"We're not interested in — " 
B. J. began furiously, but Bither 
cut her off. 

"We is, though, Beej. Might be 
important for us to know what 
kind of defenses New Yorjc has 
built up, and I going to ask him 
if I got the chance." He sighed. 
"Well, there other ways to skin 
a glovebeast. Lean back and relax, Alvah." 

"No tricks?" Alvah asked suspiciously. 

"No, we just going to try to 
improve your conscious recall. 
Relax now; close your eyes. Now 



think of a room, one that's familiar to you, and describe it to me. 
Take your time . . . Now we going 
further back — further back. You 
three years old and you just dropped something on the floor. What 
is it?" 

Bither seemed to know what he 
was doing, Alvah had to admit. 
Day after day they dredged up 
bits and scraps of memory from 
his childhood, events he had forgotten so completely that he 
would almost have sworn they 
had never happened. At first, all 
of them seemed trivial and irrelevant, but even so, Alvah 
found, there was an unexpected 
fascination in this search through 
the dusty attics of his mind. Once 
they hit something that made 
Bither sit up sharply — a dark 
figure holding something furry, 
and an accompanying remembered stench. 

Whether or not it had been as 
important as Bither seemed to 
think, they never got it back 
again. But they did get other 
things — an obscene couplet about 
the Muckfeet that had been popular in P. S. 9073 when Alvah was 
ten; a scene from a realie feature 
called Nix on the Stix; a whispered horror story; a frightening 
stereo picture in a magazine. 

"What we have to do," B. J. 
told him at one point, "is to make 
you realize that none of this was 
your own idea. They made you 



NATURAL STATE 



45 



feel this way. They did it to you." 

"Well, I know that," said Alvah. 

She stared at him in astonishment. "You knew it all along — 
and you don't care?" 

"No." Alvah felt puzzled and 
irritated. "Why should I?" 

"Don't you think they should 
have let you make up your own 
mind?" 

Alvah considered this. "You 
have to make your children see 
things the way you do, otherwise 
there wouldn't be any continuity 
from one generation to the next. 
You couldn't keep any kind of 
civilization going. Where would 
we be if we let people wander 
off into the Sticks and become 
Muckfeet?" 

TTE finished triumphantly, but 
she didn't react properly. She 
merely grinned with an exasperating air of satisfaction and said, 
"Why should they want to — unless we can give them a better 
life than the Cities can?" 

This was absurd, but Alvah 
couldn't find the one answer that 
would flatten her, no matter how 
long and often he mulled it over. 
Meanwhile, his tolerance of 
Muckfoot dwellings progressed 
from ten minutes to thirty, to an 
hour, to a full day. He didn't like 
it and nothing, he knew, could 
ever make him like it, but he 
could stand it. He was able to 



ride for short distances on Muckfoot animals, and he was even 
training himself to wear an animal-hide belt for longer and longer periods each day. But he still 
couldn't eat Muckfoot food — the 
bare thought of it still nauseated 
him — and his own supplies were 
running short. 

Oddly, he didn't feel as anxious 
about it as he should have. He 
could sense the resistance within 
him softening day by day. He 
was irrationally sure that that 
last obstacle would go, too, when 
the time came. Something else 
was bothering him, something he 
couldn't even name — but he 
dreamed of it at night and its 
symbol was the threatening vast 
arch of the sky. 

After the Fair was over, it 
seemed that B. J. had very little 
work to do. As far as Alvah could 
make out, the same was true of 
everybody. The settlement grew 
mortuary-still. For an hour or so 
every morning, lackadaisical 
trading went on in the central 
market place. In the evenings, 
sometimes, there was music of a 
sort and a species of complicated 
ungainly folk-dancing. The rest 
of the time, children raced 
through the streets and across the 
pastures, playing incomprehensible games. Their elders, when 
they were visible, sat — on doorsteps by ones and twos, grouped 
on porches and lawns — their 



46 




 



hands busy, oftener than not, 
with some trifle of carving or 
needlework, but their faces as 
blank and sleepy as a frog's in 
the Sun. 

"What do you do for excitement around here?" he asked B. 
J. in a dither of boredom. 

She looked at him oddly. "We 
work. We make things, or watch 
things grow. But maybe that's 
not the kind of excitement you 
mean." 

"It isn't, but let it go." 

"Our simple pleasures probably 
wouldn't interest you," she said 
reflectively. "They're pretty dull. 
We dance, go riding, swim in the 
lake . . ." 

So they swam. 

TT wasn't bad. It was unsettling 
to have no place to swim to — 
you had to head out from the 
shore, gauging your distance, and 
then turn around to go back — but 
the lake, to Alvah's considerable 
surprise, was clearer and bettertasting than any pool he'd ever 
been in. 

Lying on the grass afterward 
was a novel sensation, too. It was 
comfortable — no, it was nothing 
of the sort; the grass blades 
prickled and the ground was 
lumpy. Not comfortable, but — 
comforting. It was the weight, 
he thought lazily, the massive 
mother-weight of the whole Earth 
cradling you — the endless slow 



pendulum-swing you felt when 
you closed your eyes. 

He sat up, feeling cheerfully 
torpid. B. J. was lying on her 
back beside him, eyes shut, one 
arm flung back behind her head. 
It was a graceful pose. In a detached way, he admired it, first 
in general and then in particular 
— the fine texture of her skin, 
the firmness of her bosom under 
the halter that half -covered it, 
the delicate tint of her closed 
eyelids — the catalogue prolonged 
itself, and he realized that B. J., 
when you got a good look at her, 
was a uniquely lovely girl. He 
wondered, in passing, how he had 
missed noticing it before. 

She opened her eyes and looked at him. There was a groundswell of some sort and, without 
particular surprise, Alvah found 
himself leaning over and kissing 
her. 

"Beej," he said some time 
later, "when I go back to New 
York — I don't suppose you'd 
want to come with me? I mean 
— you're different from the 
others. You're educated, you can 
read; even your grammar is 
good." 

"I know you mean it as a compliment and I'm doing my best 
not to sound ungrateful or hurt 
your feelings, but . . ." She made 
a frustrated gesture. "Take the 
reading — that's a hobby of Doc's 
and I picked it up from him. It's 



NATURAL STATE 



47 



a primitive skill, Alvah, something like manuscript illuminating. We have better ways now. 
We don't need it any more. Then 
the grammar ■ — didn't it ever 
strike you that I might be using 
your kind just to make things 
easier for you?" 

She frowned. "I guess that was 
a mistake. As of now, I quit. No, 
listen a minute! The only difference between your grammar and 
ours is that yours is sixty years 
out of date. You still use 'I am, 
you are, he is' and all that archaic nonsense of tenses, case and 
gender. What for? If that's good, 
suppose we hunted up somebody 
who said 'I am, thou art, he is,' 
would his grammar be better 
than yours?" 

"Well—" said Alvah. 

"And about New York, I appreciate that. But the Cities are 
done for, Alvah. In ten years 
there won't be one left. They're 
finished." 

ALVAH stiffened. "That's the 
most ridiculous — " 
"Is it? Then why are you 
here?" 

"Well, we're in a crisis period 
now, but we've come through 
them before. You can't — " 

"This crisis of yours started a 
long while ago. J r i remember, it 
was around 1927 -flat Muller first 
changed the genes in fruit flies 
with X-ray bombardment. That 



was the first step — over a hundred years before you were even 
born. Then came colchicine and 
the electron microscope and microsurgery, all in the next thirty 
years. But the day biological engineering really grew up — 1962, 
Jenkins' and Scripture's gene 
charts and techniques — the Cities 
began to go. Little by little, people drifted out, to the land again, 
raising the new crops, growing 
the new animals. 

"The big Cities cannibalized 
the little ones, like an insect eating its own body when its food 
supply runs out. Now that's gone 
as far as it can, and you think it's 
just another crisis, but it isn't. 
It's the end." 

Alvah heard a chill echo of 
Wytak's words: "Rome fell. 
Babylon fell. The same thing can 
happen to New York . . ." 

He said, "What am I supposed 
to be, the rat that leaves the 
sinking ship?" 

She sighed. "Alvah, you got a 
better brain than that. 

"You don't have to think in 
metaphors or slogans, like a moron. I'm not asking you to join 
the winning side. That doesn't 
matter. In a few years there won't 
be but one side, no matter which 
way you jump." 

"What do you Want then?" he 
asked. 

She looked dispirited. "Nothing, I guess. Let's go home." 



48 




 



TT was a series of little things 
after that. There was the time 
he and Beej, out walking in the 
cool of the morning, stopped to 
rest at an isolated house that 
turned out to be occupied by 
George Allister of the Coffin clan, 
the shy little man who'd tried to 
show Alvah how to make his 
marks the day he landed. 

George, Alvah believed — and 
questioning of Beej afterward 
confirmed it — was about as low 
on the social scale as a Muckfoot 
could get. But he was his own 
master. He had a wife and three 
children and neat fields, with his 
own animals grazing in them. 
His house was big and cool and 
clean. He poured them lemonade 
— which Alvah wistfully had to 
decline — from a sweating peacock-blue pitcher, while sitting 
at his ease on the broad front 
porch. 

There were no servants among 
the Muckfeet. Alvah remembered an ancient fear of his, something that had cropped up in the 
old days every time he got seriously interested in a girl — that his 
children, if any, might relapse 
into the labor-pool category from 
which he had risen or — it was 
hard to say which would be worse* 
^-into the servants' estate. 

He went back fiom that outing 
very silent and thoughtful. 

There was the time, a few days 
later, when Beej was working, 



and Alvah, at loose ends, wandered into a room in the laboratory 
building where two of Bither's 
assistants, girls he knew by sight, 
were sitting with two large, leathery-woody, pod-shaped boxes 
open on the bench between them. 

Being hungry for company and 
preoccupied with himself at the 
same time, he didn't notice what 
should have been obvious, that 
the girls were busy at something 
private and personal. Even when 
they closed the boxes between 
them, he wasn't warned. "What's 
this?" he said cheerfully. "Can I 
see?" 

They glanced at each other 
uncertainly. "These is our bride 
boxes," said the brunette. "We 
don't usual show them to singletons — " 

They exchanged another 
glance. 

"He's spoke for anyhow," said 
the redhead, with an enigmatic 
look at Alvah. 

They opened the boxes. Inside 
each was a multitude of tiny compartments, each with a bit of 
something wrapped in cloth or 
paper tissue. The brunette chose 
one of the largest and unwrapped 
it with exaggerated care — an 
amorphous reddish-brown lump. 

"Houseplant," she said, and 
wrapped it up again. 

The redhead showed him a 
vial full of minuscule white 
spheres. "Weaver eggs. Two hun

49 



dred of them. That's a lot, but I 
like more curtains and things 
than most." 

"Wait a minute," said Alvah, 
perplexed. "What does a houseplant do?" 

"Grow a house, of course," the 
brunette said. She held up another vial full of eggs. "Scavengers." 

The redhead had a translucent 
sac with dark specks in it. "Utility trees." 

"Garbage converter." 

"This grows into a bed and 
these is chairbushes." 

And so on, interminably, while 
the girls' eyes glittered and their 
cheeks flushed with enthusiasm. 

'T'HE boxes, Alvah gathered, 
contained the germs of everything that would be needed to 
set up a Muckfoot household — 
beginning with the house itself. 
A thought struck him: "Does 
Beej have one of these outfits?" 

Wide-eyed stares from both 
girls. "Well, of course!" 

Alvah shifted uncomfortably. 
"Funny, she never mentioned it." 

The girls exchanged another of 
those enigmatic glances and said 
nothing. Alvah, for some reason, 
grew more uncomfortable still. 
He tried once more. "What about 
the man — doesn't he have to put 
up anything?" 

Yes, the man was expected to 
supply all the brutes and the 
seeds for outbuildings and all the 



crops except the bride's kitchengarden. Everything in and around 
the home was her province, everything outside was his. 

"Oh," said Alvah. 

"But if a young fellow don't 
have all that through no fault 
of his own, his clan put up for 
him and let him pay back when 
he able." 

"Ah," said Alvah and turned 
to make his escape. 

The redhead called after him, 
"You thought any about what 
clan you like to get adopted into, 
Alvah?" 

"Uh, no," said Alvah. "I don't 
think—" 

"You talk to Doc Bither. He a 
elder of the Steins. Mighty good 
clan!" 

Alvah bolted. 

Then there was the Shakespeare business. It began in his 
third week in the Sticks, when he 
was already carrying a fleshy 
Muckfoot vegetable around with 
him — a radnip, B. J. called it. 
He hadn't had the nerve yet to 
bite into it, but he knew the time 
was coming when he would. Beej 
came to him and said, "Alvah, 
the Rinaldos' drama group is 
doing Hamlet next Saturday, and 
they're short a Polonius. Do you 
think you could study it up by 
then?" 

"What's Hamlet? And who's 
Polonius?" 

She got the bird out of the li

brary for him and he listened 
to the play, which turned out to 
be an archaic version of The 
Manager of Copenhagen. The 
text was nothing like the modernized abridgment he was used to, 
or the Muckfeet's slovenly speech 
either. It was full of words like 
down-gyved and unkennel. It was 
three-quarters incomprehensible 
until he began to get the hang 
of it, but it had a curious power. 
For who would bear the whips 
and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, the pangs of despised 
love, and so on and so on. It 
rumbled, but it rumbled well. 

pOLONIUS, however, was the 
*■ character Alvah knew as Paul 
Arnson, an inconsequential old 
man who only existed in the play 
to foul up the love affair between 
the principals and got killed in 
the third act. Alvah ventured to 
suggest that he might be of more 
use as Hamlet, but the director, 
a dry little man with a surprising 
boom to his voice, stubbornly insisted that all he needed was a 
Polonius — and seemed to intimate, without actually saying so, 
that Alvah was a dim prospect 
even for that. 

Alvah, with blood in his eye, 
accepted the part. 

The rehearsals were a nightmare. The lines themselves gave 
him no trouble — Alvah was a 



quick study; in the realies, you 
had to be — and neither, at first, 
did the rustic crudity of the stage 
he was asked to perform on. Letter-perfect when the other actors 
were still stuttering and blowing 
their lines, he walked through the 
part with quiet competence and 
put the director's sour looks down 
to a witless hayseed hostility — 
until, three days before the performance, he suddenly awoke to 
the realization that everyone else 
in the cast was acting rings 
around him. 

This wasn't the realies. There 
were no microphones to amplify 
his voice, no cameras to record 
every change in his expression. 
And the audience, what there was 
of it, was going to be right — out 
— there. 

Alvah went to pieces. Trying 
to emulate the others' wide gestures and declamatory delivery 
only threw him further off his 
stride. He had never had stagefright in his life, but by curtain 
time on Saturday night, he was 
a pale and quivering wreck. 

Dead and dragged off the stage 
at the end of act three, he got 
listlessly back into his own 
clothes and headed for an inconspicuous exit, but the director 
waylaid him. "Gustad," he said 
abruptly, "you ever thought of 
yourself as a professional actor?" 

"I had some such idea at one 
time," Alvah said. "Why?" 



NATURAL STATE 



51 



"Well, I don't see why you 
shouldn't. If you work at it. I 
never see a man pick up so fast." 

"What?" cried Alvah, thunderstruck. 

"You wasn't bad," said the director. "A few rough edges, but 
a good performance. Now I happen to know some people in a 
few repertory companies — the 
Mondrillo Troupe, the Kalfoglou 
Repertory, one or two more. If 
you interested, I'll bird them and 
see if there's an opening. Don't 
thank me, don't thank me." He 
moved off a few steps, then turned. "Oh, and, Gustad — get back 
into your costume, will you?" 

"Uh," said Alvah. "But I'm 
dead. I mean — " 

"For the curtain calls," said the 
director. "You don't want to miss 
those." He waved and walked 
back into the wings. 

Alvah absently drew out his 
radnip and crunched off a bite 
of it. The taste was faintly unpleasant, like that of old protein 
paste or the wrong variety of 
culture -cheese, but he chewec? 
and swallowed 'it. 

ri^HAT was when he realized 
that he had to get out. He 
didn't put on his costume again. 
Instead, he rummaged through 
the property boxes until he found 
an old pair of moleskiri trousers 
and a stained squareweb shirt. 
He put them on, left by the rear 



door and headed south. 

South for two reasons. First, 
because, he hoped, no one would 
look for him in that direction. 
Second, because he remembered 
what Beej had said that first day 
when they passed the display of 
tools: "The metal comes from 
Iron Pits, just a few miles south 
of here." 

There might be some slender 
chance still that he could get the 
metal he needed, delouse the 
floater and go home in style — 
without the painful necessity of 
explaining to Wytak what had 
happened to the floater and all 
his goods and equipment. If not, 
he would simply keep on walking. 

He had to do it now. He had 
almost waited too long as it was. 

They had laid out the pattern 
of a life for him — to marry Beej, 
settle down in a house that would 
grow from a seed Beej kept in a 
pod-shaped box, be a rustic repertory actor, raise little Muckfeet. And the devil of it was, 
some unreasonable part of him 
wanted all of that! 

A good thing he hadn't stayed 
for the curtain calls . . . 

The Sun declined as he went, 
until he was walking down a 
ghost-dim road under the stars, 
with all the cool cricket-shrill 
world to himself. 

He spent the night uncomfortably huddled under a hedge. 
Birds woke him with a great 



52 




 



clamor in the tree-tops shortly 
after dawn. He washed himself 
and drank from a stream that 
crossed the fields, ate a purplishred fruit he found growing nearby, then moved on. 

Two hours later, he topped a 
ridge and found his way barred 
by a miles-long shallow depression in the Earth. Like the rest 
of the visible landscape, it was 
filled with an orderly checkerwork of growing plants. 

There was nothing for it but 
to go through if he could. But 
surely he had gone more than "a 
few miles" by now? 

The road slanted down the 
embankment to a gate in a high 
thorn hedge. Behind the gate was 
a kind of miniature domed kiosk 
and, in the kiosk, a sunburned 
man was dozing with a greenand-purple bird on his shoulder. 

Alvah inspected a signboard 
that was entangled somehow in 
the hedge next to the gate. He 
was familiar enough by now with 
the Muckfeet's picture-writing to 
be fairly sure of what it said. 
The first symbol was a nail with 
an ax-head attached to it. That 
was iron. The second was a few 
stylized things that resembled 
fruit seeds. Pits? 

TTE stared through the gate in 
mounting perplexity. You 
might call a place like this "Pits," 
all right, but imagination boggled 



at calling it a mine. Still . . . 

The kiosk, he noticed now, 
bore a scrawled symbol in orange 
pigment. He recognized that one,' 
too; it was one of the common 
name-signs. 

"Jerry!" he called. * 

"Rrk," remarked the bird on 
the sleeping man's shoulder. 
"Kerry brogue; but the degradation of speech that occurs in 
London, Glasgow — " 

"Oh, damn!" said Alvah. "You, 
there. Jerry!" 

"Rrk. Kerry brogue; but the — " 

"Jerry!" 

"Kerry brogue!" shrieked the 
bird. The sunburned man sat up 
with a start and seized it by the 
beak, choking it off in the middle 
of "degradation." 

"Oh, hello," he said. "Don't 
know what it is about a Shaw 
bird, but they all alike. Can't 
shut them up." 

"I'd like," said Alvah, "to look 
through the — uh — Pits. Would 
that be all right?" 

"Sure," the man said cheerfully. He opened the gate and 
led the way down a long avenue 
between foot-high rows of plants. 

"I Jerry Finch," he said. 
"Littleton clan. Don't believe you 
said your name." 

"Harris," Alvah supplied at 
random. "I visiting from up 
north." 

"Yukes?" the man inquired. 

Alvah nodded, hoping for the 



NATURAL STATE 



53 



best, and pointed at the plants 
they were passing. "What these?" 

"Hinge blanks. Let them to 
forage last month. Won't have 
another crop here till August, and 
a poor one then. I tell Angus — 
he's the Pit boss — I tell him this 
soil's wore out, but he a pincher 
— squeeze the last ton out and 
then go after the pounds and 
ounces. You should seen what 
come off the ringbushes in the 
east hundred this April. Pitiful. 
Had to sell them for eyelets." 

A cold feeling was running up 
Alvah's spine. He cleared his 
throat. "Got any knife blades?" 
he inquired with careful casualness. 

"Mean bowies? Well, sure — 
right over yonder." 

ALVAH followed him to the 
end of the field and down 
three steps into the next. The 
plants here were much taller and 
darker, with stems thick and 
gnarled out of all proportion to 
their height. Here and there 
among the glossy leaves were incongruous glints of silvery steel. 

Alvah stooped and peered into 
the foliage. 

The silvery glints were perfectly formed six-inch chromesteel knife blades. Each was 
attached to — growing from — the 
plant by way of a hard brown 
stem, exactly the right size and 
shape to serve as a handle. 



He straightened carefully. "We 
do things a little different up 
north. You mind explaining briefly how the Pits works?" 

Jerry looked surprised, but began readily enough. "These like 
any other ferropositors. They extract the metal from the ores and 
deposit it in the bowie shape, or 
whatever it might be. Work from 
the outside in, of course, so you 
don't have no wood core to weaken it. We get a year's crops, average, before the ore used up. Then 
we bring the Earth-movers in, 
deepen the Pit a few feet, reseed 
and start over. Ain't much more 
to it." 

Alvah stared at the fantastic 
growths. Well, why not? Plants 
that grew into knives or doorknobs or . . . 

"What about alloys?" he asked. 

"We got iron, lead and zinc. 
Carbon from the air. Other metals we got to import in granules. 
Like we get chrome from the 
Northwest Federation, mostly. 
They getting too big for their 
britches, though. Greedy. I think 
we going to switch over to you 
Yukes before long. Not that you 
fellows is any better, if you ask 
me, but at least — " 

"Rhodium," said Alvah. "Palladium. What about them?" 

"How that?" 

"Platinum group." 

"Oh, sure, I know what you 
mean. We never use them. No call 



54 




 



to. We could get you some, I 
guess — I think the Northwests 
got them. Take a few months, 
though." 

"Suppose you wanted to make 
something out of a rhodopalladium alloy. How long would it 
take after you got the metals?" 

"Well, you have to make a 
bush that would take and put 
them together, right proportions, 
right size, right shape. Depends. 
I guess if you was in a hurry — " 

"Never mind," said Alvah 
wearily. "Thanks for the information." He turned and started 
back toward the gate. 

When he was halfway there, he 
heard a hullabaloo break out 
somewhere behind him. 

"Waw!" the voices seemed to 
be shouting. "Waw! Waw!" 

TTE turned. A dozen paces behind him, Jerry and the bird 
on his shoulder were in identical 
neck-straining attitudes. Beyond 
them, on the near side of a group 
of low buildings three hundred 
yards away, three men were waving their arms madly and shoutting, "Waw! Waw!" 

"Wawnt to know what it is," 
the bird squawked. "I wawnt be 
a Mahn. Violet: you come along 
with me, to your own — " 

"Shut up," said Jerry, then 
cupped his hands and yelled, 
"Angus, what is it?" 

"Chicagos," the answer drifted 

NATURAL STATE 



back. "Just got word! They dusting Red Pits! Come on!" 

Jerry darted a glance over his 
shoulder. "Come on!" he repeated 
and broke into a loping run toward the buildings. 

Alvah hesitated an instant, then 
followed. With strenuous effort, 
he managed to catch up to the 
other man. "Where are we running to?" he panted. "Red Pits?" 

"Don't talk foolish," Jerry 
gasped. "We running to shelter." 
He glanced back the way they 
had come. "Red Pits over that 
way." 

Alvah risked a look and then 
another. The first time, he wasn't 
sure. The second time, the dusting of tiny particles over the 
horizon had grown to a cluster 
of visibly swelling black dots. 

Other running figures were converging on the buildings as Angus 
and Jerry approached. The dots 
were capsule shapes, perceptibly 
elongated, the size of a fingernail, a thumbnail, a thumb . . . 

And under them on the land 
was a hurtling streak of goldendun haze, like dust stirred by a 
huge invisible finger. 

Rounding the corner of the 
nearest building, Jerry popped 
through an open doorway. Alvah 
followed — 

And was promptly seized from 
either side, long enough for something heavy and hard to hit him 
savagely on the nape of the neck.

VII 

"OITHER was intent over a 
shallow vessel half full of a 
viscous clear liquid, with a great 
rounded veined - and - patterned 
glistening lump immersed in it, 
transparent in the phosphor-light 
that glowed from the sides of the 




container — a single living cell in 
mitosis, so grossly enlarged that 
every gene of every paired chromosome was visible. B. J. watched from the other side of the 
table, silent, breathing carefully, 
as the man's thick fingers dipped 
a hair -thin probe with minuscule 
precision, again and again, into 
the yeasty mass, exercising a particle, splitting another, delicately 
shaving a third. 

From time to time, she glanced 
at a sheet of horn intricately inscribed with numbers and genetic 
symbols. The chart was there for 
her benefit, not for Bither's — he 
never paused or faltered. 



Finally, he sat back and covered the pan. "Turn on the lights 
and put that in the reduction 
fluid, will you, Beej? I bushed." 

She whistled a clear note, and 
the dark globes fixed to the ceiling glowed to blue-white life? 
"You going to grow it right 
away?" * 

"Have to, I guess. Dammit, 
Beej, I hate making weapons." 

"Not our choice. When you 
think it be?" 

He shrugged. "War meeting 
this afternoon over at Council 
Flats. They let us know when it 
be." 

She was silent until she had 
transferred the living lump from 
one container to another and put 
it away. Then, "Hear anything 
more?" 

"They dusting every ore-bed 
from here to the Illinois, look like. 
Crystal, Butler's—" 

"Butler's! That worked out." 

"I know it. We let them land 
there. They find out." After another pause, Bither said, "No 
word about Alvah, Beej. I sorry." 

She nodded. "Wouldn't be, this 
early." 

He looked at her curiously. 
"You still think he be back?" 

"If the dust ain't got him. Lay 
you odds." 

"Well," said Bither, lifting the 
cover of another pan to peer into 
it, "I hope you — " 

"Ozark Lake nine-one-two


56 




 



five," said a reedy voice from 
the corner. "Ozark Lake nine — " 

"Get that, will you, Beej?" 

B. J. picked up the ocher spheroid from its shelf and said into 
its tympanum, "Bither Laboratories." 

"This Angus Littleton at Iron 
Pits," the thing said. "Let me 
talk to Bither." 

She passed it over, holding a 
loop of its rubbery cord — the beginning of a miles-long sheathed 
bundle of cultivated neurons that 
linked it, via a "switchboard" 
organism, with thousands like it 
in this area alone, and with millions more across the continent. 

"This Doc Bither. What is it, 
Angus?" 

"Something funny for you, 
Doc. We got a couple prisoners 
here, one a floater pilot, other a 
Chicago spy." 

"Well, what you want me to—" 

"Wait, can't you? This spy 
claim he know you, Doc. Say his 
name Custard. Alvah Custard." 

A LVAH stared out through the 
window, puzzled and angry. 
He had been in the room for 
about half an hour, while things 
were going on outside. He had 
tried to break the window. The 
pane had bent slightly. It was 
neither glass nor plastic, and it 
wasn't breakable. 

Outside, the last of the invading floaters was dipping down to


ward the horizon, pursued by a 
small darting black shape. Golden-dun haze obscured all the 
foreground except the first few 
rows of plants, which were drooping on their stems. The squadron 
had made one grand circle of the 
mine area, dusting as they went, 
before the Muckfeet on their 




incredibly swift flyers — birds or 
reptiles, Alvah couldn't tell which 
— had risen to engage them. Since 
then, a light breeze from the 
north had carried the stuff dropped over the Pits: radioactive 
dust with a gravitostatic charge 
to make it rebound and spread — 
and then, with its polarity reversed, cling like grim death where it 
fell. 

He turned and looked at the 
other man, sitting blank-faced 
and inattentive, wearing rumpled 
sky-blue uniform, on the bench 
against the inner wall. Most of 
the squadron had flown off to the 
west after that first pass, and had 



NATURAL STATE 



57 



either escaped or been forced 
down somewhere beyond the Pits. 
This fellow had crash-landed in 
the fields not five hundred yards 
from Alvah's window. Alvah had 
seen the Muckfeet walking out to 
the wreck — strolling fantastically 
through the deadly haze — and 
turkey - trotting their prisoner 
back again. A little later, someone 
had opened the door and shoved 
the man in, and there he had sat 
ever since. 

His skin-color was all right. 
He was breathing evenly and 
seemed in no discomfort. As far 
as Alvah could see, there was not 
a speck of the death -dust anywhere on his skin, hair or clothing. But mad as it was, this was 
not the most incongruous thing 
about him. 

His uniform was of a cut and 
pattern that Alvah had seen only 
in pictures. There was a C on 
each gleaming button and, on 
the bar of the epaulette, CHIcagoland. In short, he was evidently a Floater Force officer 
from Chicago. The only trouble 
was that Alvah recognized him. 
He was a grips by day at the 
Seven Boroughs studios, famous 
for his dirty jokes, which he acquired at his night job in the 
Under Queens Power Station. He 
was a lieutenant j.g. in the N. Y. 
F. F. Reserve, and his name was 
Joe "Dimples" Mundry. 

Alvah went over and sat down 



beside him again. Mundry's normally jovial face was set in wooden lines. His eyes focused on 
Alvah, but without recognition. 
"Joe—" 

"My name," said Mundry obstinately, "is Bertram Palmer, 
Float Lieutenant, Windy City 
Regulars. My serial number is 
79016935." 

T^HAT was the only tune he 
■■■ knew. Alvah hadn't been able 
to get another word out of him. 
Name, rank and serial number — 
that was normal. Members of 
the armed services were naturally conditioned to say nothing 
else if captured. But why throw 
in the name of his outfit? 

One, that was the way they did 
things in Chicago, and there just 
happened to be a Chicago soldier 
who looked and talked exactly 
like Joe Mundry, who had the 
same scars on his knuckles from 
brawls with the generator monkeys. Two, Alvah's mind had snapped. Three, this was a ringer 
foisted on Alvah for some incomprehensible purpose by the 
Muckfeet. And four — a wild and 
terrible suspicion . . . 

Alvah tried again. "Listen, Joe, 
I'm your friend. We're on the 
same side. I'm not a Muckfoot." 

"My name is Bertram Palmer, 
Float Lieutenant — " 

"Joe, I'm leveling with you. 
Listen — remember the Music 



58 




 



Hall story, the one about the 
man who could . . ." Alvah explained in detail what the man 
could do. It was obscenely improbable and very funny, if you 
liked that sort of thing, and it 
was a story Joe had told him two 
days before he left New York. 

A gleam of intelligence came 
into Joe's eyes. "What's the 
punchline?" he demanded. 

" 'What the hell did you want 
to change the key on me for?' " 
Alvah replied promptly. 

Joe looked at him speculatively. "That might be a old joke. 
Maybe they even know it in the 
Sticks. And my name isn't Joe." 

He really believed he was Bertram Palmer of the Windy City 
Regulars, that much seemed 
clear. Also, if it was possible that 
the Muckfeet knew that story, it 
was likelier still that the Chicagolanders knew it. 

"All right," said Alvah, "ask 
me a question — something I 
couldn't know if I were a Muckfoot. Go ahead, anything. A place, 
or something that happened recently, or whatever you want." 

A visible struggle was going on 
behind Joe's face. "Can't think 
of anything," he said at last. 
"Funny." 

Alvah had been watching him 
closely. "Let's try this. Did you 
see Manhattan Morons?" 

Joe looked blank. "What?" 

"The realie. You mean you 



missed it? Manhattan Morons? 
Till I saw that, I never really 
knew what a comical bunch of 
weak-minded, slobber-mouthed, 
monkey - faced drooling idiots 
those New Yorkers — " 

Joe's expression had not changed, but a dull red flush had crept 
up over his collar. He made an 
inarticulate sound and lunged for 
Alvah's throat. 

When Angus Littleton opened 
the door, with Jerry and B. J. 
behind him, the two men were 
rolling on the floor. 

"TVTHAT made you think he 

" was a spy?" B. J. demanded. They were a tight self-conscious group in the corridor. 
Alvah was nursing a split lip. 

"Said he a Yuke," Jerry offered, "but didn't seem too sure, so 
I said the Yukes greedy. He never 
turn a hair. And he act like he 
never see a mine before. Things 
like that." 

B. J. nodded. "It was a natural 
mistake, I guess. Well, thanks for 
calling us, Angus." 

"Easy," said Angus, looking 
glum. "We ain't out of the rough 
yet, Beej." 

"What do you mean? He didn't 
have anything to do with this 
attack — he's from New York." 

"He say he is, but how you 
know? What make you think he 
ain't from Chicago?" 

Alvah said, "While you're ask


NATURAL STATE 



59 



ing that, you might ask another 
question about him." He jerked a 
thumb toward the closed door. 
"What makes you think he is?" 

The other three stared at him 
thoughtfully. "Alvah," Beej began, "what are you aiming at? 
Do you think — " 

"I'm not sure," Alvah interrupted. "I mean I'm sure, but I'm 
not sure I want to tell you. 
Look," he said, turning to Angus, 
"let me talk to her alone for a 
few minutes, will you?" 

Angus hesitated, then walked 
away down the hall, followed by 
Jerry. 

"You've got to explain some 
things to me about this raid," 
said Alvah when they were out 
of hearing. "I saw those floaters 
dusting and it was the real thing. 
I can tell by the way the plants 
withered. But your people were 
walking around out there. Him, 
too — the prisoner. How come?" 

"Antirads," said the girl. 
"Little para-insects, like the metallophage — the metallophage was 
developed from them. When 
you've been exposed, the antirads 
pick the dust particles off you 
and . deposit them in radproof 
pots. They die in the pots, too, 
and We bury the whole — " 

"All right," Alvah said. "How 
long have you had those things? 
Is there any chance the Cities 
knew about it?" 

"The antirads were developed 



toward the end of the last City 
war. That was what ended it. At 
first we stopped the bombing, 
and then when they used dust — 
You never heard of any of this?" 

"No," Alvah told her. "Third 
question, what are you going to 
do about Chicago now, on account of this raid?" 

"T)ULL it down around their 
•■- ears," B. J. said gravely. 
"We never did before partly 
because it wasn't necessary. We 
knew for the last thirty years 
that the Cities could never be 
more than a nuisance to us again. 
But this isn't just a raid. They've 
attacked us all over this district 
— ruined the crops in every mine. 
We must put an end to it now — 
not that it makes much difference, this year or ten years from 
now. And it isn't as if we couldn't 
save the people . . ." 

"Never mind that," said Alvah 
abstractedly. Then her last words 
penetrated. "No, go ahead — 
what?" 

"I started to say, we think we'll 
be able to save the people, or 
most of them — partly thanks to 
what we learned from you. It's 
just Chicago we're going to destroy, not the — " 

"Learned from me?" Alvah repeated. "What do you mean?" 

"We learned that, when it's a 
question of survival, a City man 
can overcome his conditioning. 



60 




 



You proved that. Did you eat the 
radnip?" 
"Yes." 

"There, you see? And you'll eat 
another and, sooner or later, 
you'll realize they taste good. A 
human being can learn to like 
anything that's needful to him. 
We're adaptable — you can't condition that out of us without 
breaking us." 

Alvah stared at her. "But you 
spent over two weeks on me. How 
are you going to do that with 
fifteen or twenty million people 
all at once?" 

"We can do it. You were the 
pilot model — two weeks for you. 
But now that we know how, we're 
pretty sure we can do it in three 
days — the important part, getting 
them to eat the food. And it's a 
good thing the storehouses are 
full, all over this continent." 

They looked at each other silently for a moment. "But the 
Cities have to go," B. J. said. 

"Fourth and last question," he 
said. "If a City knew about your 
radiation defenses all along, what 
would be their reason for attacking you this way?" 

"Our first idea was that it was 
just plain desperation — they had 
to do something and there wasn't 
anything they could do that 
would work, so they just did 
something that wouldn't. Or 
maybe they hoped they'd be able 
to hold the mines long enough to 



get some metal out, even though 
they knew it was foolish to hope." 

"That was your first idea. 
What was your second?" 

She hesitated. "You remember 
what I told you, that the Cities 
cannibalized each other for a 
while, the big ones draining population away from the little ones 
and reclaiming their metals — and 
you remember I said that had 
gone as far as it could?" 

"Yes." 

"Well, when the big fish have 
eaten up all the little fish, they 
can eat each other till there's 
just one big fish left." 

"And?" asked Alvah tensely. 

"And maybe one City might 
think that, if they got us to make 
war on another, they could step 
in when the fighting was over and 
get all the metals they'd need to 
keep them going for years. So 
they might send raiding parties 
out in the other City's uniforms, 
and condition them to think they 
really were from that City. Was 
that what happened, Alvah?" 

ALVAH nodded reluctantly. 
"I don't understand it. They 
must have started planning this 
as soon as I stopped communicating. It doesn't make sense. 
They couldn't be that desperate 
— or maybe they could. Anyway, 
it's a dirty stunt. It isn't like 
New York." 

She said nothing — too polite 



NATURAL STATE 



61 



to contradict him, Alvah supposed. 

Down at the end of the hall, 
Angus was beginning to look impatient. Alvah said, "So now 
you'll pull New York down?" 

"Alvah, it may sound funny, 
b.ut I think you know this, really 
— you're doing your people a 
favor." 

"If that's so," he said wryly, 
"then New York was 'really' trying to do one for Chicago." 

"I was hoping you'd see that 
it doesn't matter. It might have 
been Chicago that went first, or 
Denver, or any of the others, 
but that isn't important — they 
all have to go. What's important 
is the people. This may be another thing that's hard for you to 
accept, but they're going to be 
happier, most of them." 

And maybe she was right, Alvah thought, if you counted in 
everybody, labor pool, porters 
and all. Why shouldn't you count 
them, he asked himself defiantly 
— they were people, weren't they? 
Maybe the index of civilization 
was not only how much you had, 
but how hard you had to work 
for it — incessantly, like the New 
Yorkers, holding down two or 
three jobs at once, because the 
City's demands were endless — 
or, like the Muckfeet, judiciously 
and with honest pleasure. 

"Alvah?" said the girl. She put 
her question no more explicitly 



than that, but he knew what she 
meant. 

"Yes, Beej," replied Alvah 
Gustad, Muckfoot. 

VIII 

|"VN the Jersey flats, hidden by 
a forest of traveler trees, a 
sprawling settlement took form 
— mile after mile of forcedgrowth dwellings, stables, administration buildings, instruction 
centers. It was one of five. There 
was another farther north in Jersey, two in the Poconos and one 
in the vestigial state of Connecticut. 

They lay empty, waiting, their 
roofs sprouting foliage that perfectly counterfeited the surrounding forests. Roads had been 
cleared, converging toward the 
City, ending just short of the 
half-mile strip of wasteland that 
girdled New York, and it was 
there that Alvah stood. 

He found it strange to feel 
himself ready to walk unprotected across that stretch of country, 
knowing it to be acrawl with tiny 
organisms that had been developed not to tolerate Man's artificial buildings, whether of stone, 
metal, cement or plastics, but 
crumbled them all to the ground. 
Stranger still to be able to visualize the crawling organisms without horror or disgust. 

But the strangest of all was 



62 




 



to be looking at the City from 
this viewpoint. The towers stared 
back at him across the surrounding wall, tall and shining and 
proud, the proudest human creation — a century ago. Pitifully 
outdated today, the gleaming 
Cities fought back, unaware that 
they had lost long ago, that their 
bright spires and elaborate gadgets were as antiquated as polished armor would have been against 
a dun-painted motorized army. 

"I wish I could go with you," 
said Beej from the breathing forest at his back. 

"You can't," Alvah said without turning. "They wouldn't let 
you through the gate alive. They 
know me, but even so, I'm not 
sure they'll let me in after all 
this time. Have to wait and see." 

"You know you don't have to 
go. I mean — " 

"I know what you mean," said 
Alvah unhappily, "and you're 
right. But all the same, I do have 
to go. Look, Beej, you've got that 
map I drew. It's a ten-to-one 
chance that, if I don't make the 
grade, they'll put me in the quarantine cells right inside the wall. 
So you're not to worry. Okay?" 

"Okay," she promised, worried. 

He kissed her and watched her 
fade back into the forest where 
the others were — Bither and Artie 
Brumbacher and a few others 
from home, the rest Jerseys and 
other clansmen from the Sea


board Federation — cheerful, matter-of-fact people who were 
going to bear most of the burdens of what was coming, and 
never tired of reminding the inlanders of the fact. 

He turned and walked out 
across the wasteland, crunching 
the dry weeds under his feet. 

npHERE was a naming moat 
around the City and, beyond 
the moat, high in the wall, a 
closed gateway — corroded tight, 
probably ; it was a very long time 
since the City had had any traffic 
except by air. But there was a 
spy tower above the gate. Alvah 
walked up directly opposite its 
bulbous idiot eyes, waved, and 
then waited. 

After a long time, an inconspicuous port in the tower squealed 
open and a fist-sized dark ovoid 
darted out across the flames. It 
came to rest in midair, two yards 
from Alvah, clicked and said 
crisply, "State your name and 
business." 

"Alvah Gustad. I just got back 
from a confidential mission for 
the City Manager. Floater broke 
down, communicator, everything. 
I had to walk back. Tell him I'm 
here." 

The ovoid hovered exactly 
where it was, as if pinned against 
the air. Alvah waited. When he 
got tired of standing, he dropped 
his improvised knapsack on the 



NATURAL STATE 



63 



ground and sat on it. Finally the 
ovoid said harshly, in another 
voice, "Who are you and what 
do you want?" 

Alvah patiently gave the same 
answer. 

"What do you mean, broke 
down?" 

"Broke down," said Alvah. 
"Wouldn't run any more." 

Silence. He settled himself for 
another long wait, but it was only 
five minutes or thereabouts before 
the ovoid said, "Strip." 

When he had done so, the gate 
opposite broke open with a 
scream of tortured metal and 
ground itself back into a recess 
in the wall. The drawbridge, a 
long rust-pitted tongue of metal, 
thrust out and down to span the 
moat, a wall of flame on either 
side of it. 

Alvah walked across nimbly, 
the metal already hot against his 
naked soles, and the drawbridge 
whipped back into its socket. The 
gate screamed shut. 

ITHE room was the same, the 
■■■ anthems were the same. Alvah, disinfected, shaved all over 
and clad in an airtight glassine 
overall with its own air supply, 
stopped short two paces inside 
the door. The man behind the 
Manager's desk was not Wytak. 
It was jowly, red-faced Ellery 
„ McArdle, Commissioner of the 
Department of War. 



One of the guards prodded Alvah and he kept going up to the 
desk. "Now I think I get it," 
he said, staring at McArdle. 
"When—" 

McArdle's cold gaze flickered. 
Then his heavy head dropped 
forward a trifle, and he said, 
"Finish what you were saying, 
Gustad." 

"I was about to remark," Alvah 
said, "that when Wytak's pet 
project flopped, he lost enough 
support to let you impeach him. 
Is that right?" 

McArdle nodded and seemed 
to lose interest. "Your feet are 
not swollen or blistered, Gustad. 
You didn't walk back from the 
Plains. How did you get here?" 

Alvah took a deep breath. "We 
flew— on a passenger roc — as far 
as the Adirondacks. We didn't 
want to alarm you by too much 
air traffic so near the City, so 
we joined a freight caravan 
there." 

McArdle's stony face did not 
alter, but all the meaning went 
suddenly out of it. It was as if 
the man himself had stepped 
back and shut a door. The porter 
behind his chair swayed and 
looked as if he were about to 
faint. Alvah heard one of the 
guards draw in his breath sharply. • 

"Fthuh!" said McArdle abruptly, his face contorting. "Let's get 
this over. What do you know 



64 




 



about the military plans of the 
Muckfeet? Answer me fully. If 
I'm not satisfied that you do, 
I'll have you worked over till I 
am satisfied." 

Alvah, who had been feeling 
something like St. George and 
something like a plucked chicken, discovered that anger could 
be a very comforting thing. 
"That's what I came here to do," 
he said tightly. "The Muckfeets' 
military plans are about what 
you might have expected, after 
that lousy trick of yours. They 
know it wasn't Chicago that raided them." 

McArdle started and made as 
if to rise. Then he sank back, 
staring fixedly at Alvah. 

"They've had a gutful. They're 
going to finish New York." 

"When?" said McArdle, biting 
the word off short. 

"That depends on you. If 
you're willing to be reasonable, 
they'll wait long enough for you 
to dicker with them. Otherwise, 
if I'm not back in about an 
hour, the fun starts." 

lt/|cARDLE touched a stud, 
IT J. "Green alert " pressed the 
stud again and laced his fingers 
together on the desk. "Hurry it 
up," he said to Alvah. "Let's 
have the rest." 

"I'm going to ask you to do 
something difficult," said Alvah. 
"It's this— think about what I'm 



telling you. You're not thinking 
now, you're just reacting — " 

He heard a slight movement 
behind him, saw McArdle's eyes 
flicker and his hand make a Not 
now gesture. 

"You're in the same room with 
a man who's turned Muckfoot 
and it disgusts you. You'll be 
cured of that eventually — you 
can be, I'm the proof — but all I 
want you to do now it put it aside 
and use your brains. Here are 
the facts. Your raiding parties 
got the shorts beat off them. I 
saw one of the fights — it lasted 
about twenty minutes. The 
Muckfeet could have polished off 
the Cities any time in the last 
thirty years. They haven't'done 
it till now, because — " 

McArdle was beating time with 
his fingertips on the polished ebonite. He wasn't really listening, 
Alvah saw, but there was nothing 
for it except to go ahead. 

" — they had the problem of deconditioning and re-educating 
more than twenty million innocent people, or else letting them 
starve to death, Now they have 
the knowledge they need. They 
can — " 

"The terms," said McArdle. 

"They're going to close down 
this — this reservation," Alvah 
said. "They'll satisfy you in any 
way you like that they can do it 
by force. If you help, it can be 
an orderly process in which no

body gets hurt and everybody 
gets the best possible break. And 
they'll keep the City intact as a 
museum. I talked them into that. 
Or, if they have to, they'll take 
the place apart slab by slab." 

McArdle's mouth was working 
violently. "Take him out and kill 
him, for City's sake! And, Morgan!" he called when Alvah and 
his guards were halfway to the 
door. . 

"Yes, Mr. Manager." 

"When you're through, dump 
him out the gate he came in." 

TT was a pity about Wytak, 
Alvah's brain was telling him 
frozenly. Wytak was a scoundrel 
or he* could never have got where 
he was — had been — but he wasn't 
afraid of a new idea. It might 
have been posssible to deal with 
Wytak. 

"Where we going to do it?" the 
younger one asked nervously. He 
had been pale and sweating in 
the floater all the way across 
Middle Jersey. 

"In the disinfecting chamber," 
Morgan said, gesturing with his 
pistol. "Then we haul him 
straight out. In there, you." 

"Well, let's get it over with," 
the younger one said. "I'm sick." 

"You think I'm not sick?" said 
Morgan in a strained voice. He 
gave Alvah a final shove into the 
middle of the room and stood 
back, adjusting his gun. 



Alvah found himself saying 
calmly, "Not that way. Morgan, 
unless you want to turn black 
and shrivel up a second after." 

"What's he talking about?" the 
boy whispered shakily. 

"Nothing," said Morgan. The 
hand with the gun moved indecisively. 

"To puncture me," Alvah 
warned, "you've got to puncture 
the suit. And I've been eating 
Muckfeet food for the last month 
and a half. I'm full of microorganisms — swarming with them. 
They'll bloop out of me straight 
at you, Morgan." 

Both men jerked back, as if 
they had been stung. "I'm getting outa here!" said the boy, 
grabbing for the door stud. 

Morgan blocked him. "Stay 
here!" 

"What're you going to do?" the 
younger one asked. 

He swore briefly. "We'll tell 
the O. D. Come on." 

The door closed and locked 
solidly behind them. Alvah looked to see if there was a way to 
double-lock it from his side, but 
there wasn't. He tried the opposite door to make sure it was 
locked, which it was. Then he 
examined the disinfectant nozzles, wondering if they could be 
used to squirt corrosive in on him. 
He decided they probably 
couldn't and, anyhow, he had no 
way to spike the nozzles. Then

there was nothing to do but sit 
in the middle of the bare room 
and wait, which he did. 

The next thing that happened 
was that he heard a faint far-off 
continuous noise through the almost soundproof door. He stood 
up and went over and put his 
ear against the door, and decided 
it was his imagination. 

Then there was a noise, and he 
jumped back, his skin tingling all 
over, just before the door slid 
open. The sudden maniacal clangor of a bell swept Morgan into 
the room with it, wild-eyed, his 
cap missing, drooling from a corner of his mouth, his gun high in 
one white-knuckled fist. 

"Glah!" said Morgan and pulled the trigger. 

ALVAH'S heart went bonk 
hard against his ribs, and the 
room blurred. Then he realized 
that there hadn't been any hiss 
of an ejected pellet. And he was 
still on his feet. And Morgan, 
with his mouth stretched open all 
the way back to the uvula, was 
standing there a yard away, staring at him and pulling the trigger repeatedly. 

Alvah stepped forward half a 
pace and put a straight left 
squarely on the point of Morgan's jaw. As the man fell, there 
were shrieks and running footsteps in the outer room. Somebody in Guard uniform plunged 



past the doorway, shouting incoherently, caromed off a wall, 
dwindled down a corridor. Then 
the room was full of leaping men 
in motley. 

The first of them was Artie 
Brumbacher, almost unrecognizable because he was grinning 
from ear to ear. He handed Alvah 
a four-foot knobkerrie and a 
bulging skin bag and said, "Le's 
go!" 

The streets were full of grounded floaters and stalled surface 
cars. The bells had fallen silent, 
and so had the faint omnipresent 
vibration that was like silence 
itself until it was gone. Not a 
motor was turning in the Borough of Jersey. Occasional chittering sounds floated on the air, 
and muffled buzzings and other 
odd sounds, all against the background chorus of faraway shrieks 
that rose and fell. 

At the corner of Middle Orange 
and Weehawken, opposite the Superior Court Building, they came 
upon a squad of Regulars who 
had throwrl away their useless 
guns and picked up an odd lot of 
assorted bludgeons — lengths of 
pipe, tripods and the like. 

"Now you'll see," said Artie. 

The Regulars set up a ragged 
yell and came running forward. 
The two Muckfeet on either side 
of Alvah, Artie and the bucktoothed one called Lafe, dipped 
heaping dark-brown handfuls out 



NATURAL STATE

of the bags they carried slung 
from their shoulders. Alvah followed suit, and recognized the 
stuff at last — bran meal, soaked 
in some fragrant syrup until it 
was mucilaginous and heavy. 

Artie swung first, then Lafe, 
and Alvah last — and the soggy 
lumps smacked the foremost 
faces. The squad broke, wiping 
frenziedly. But you couldn't wipe 
the stuff off. It clung coldly and 
grainily to the hair on the backs 
of your hands and your eyelashes 
and the nap of your clothing. All 
you could do was move it around. 

One berserker with a smeared 
face didn't stop, and Lafe dropped him with a knobkerrie between the eyes. One more, a 
white-faced youth, stood miraculously untouched, still hefting his 
club. He took a stride forward 
menacingly. 

Grinning, Artie raised another 
glob of the mash and ate it, 
smacking his lips. The youth 
spun around, walked drunkenly 
to the nearest wall and was rackingly sick. 

A N hour later, Knickerbocker 
Circle in Over Manhattan 
was littered with ameba-shaped 
puddles of clear plastic. Overhead, the stuff was hanging in 
festoons from the reticulated 
framework of the Roof and, for 
the first time in a century, an 
unfiltered wind was blowing into 



New York. Halfway up the sheer 
facade of the Old Movie House, 
the roc that had brought Alvah 
from Jersey was flapping along, 
a wingtip almost brushing the 
louvers, while its rider sprinkled 
pale dust from a sack. Farther 
down the street, a sickly green 
growth was already visible on 
cornices and window frames. 

The antique neon sign of the 
Old Movie dipped suddenly, its 
supports softened visibly. It 
swung, nodded and crashed to 
the pavement. 

Three hours later, a little group 
of whey-faced men in official 
dress was being loaded aboard a 
freight roc opposite the underpass to the Cauldwell Floatway 
in Over Bronnix. Alvah thought 
he saw McArdle among them, 
but he couldn't be sure. 

Twilight — all the streets that 
radiated from the heart of the 
City were afloat with long, slowly 
surging tides of humanity, dim 
in the weak glow from the lumen 
globes plastered haphazardly to 
the flanks of the buildings. At the 
end of every street, the Wall was 
crumbled down and the moat 
filled, its fire long gone out. And 
down the new railed walkways 
from all three levels came the 
men, women and children, stumbling out into the alien lumenlit night and the strange scents 
and the wide world. 

Watching from the hilltop,

with his arm around his wife's 
waist, Alvah saw them being 
herded into groups and led away, 
unprotesting — saw them in the 
wains, rolling off toward the temporary shelters where, likely as 
not, they would sleep the night 
through, too numbed to be afraid 
of the morrow. 

In the morning, their teaching 
would begin. 

Babylon, Alvah thought, 
Thebes, Angkor, Lagash, Agade, 
Tyre, Luxor, and now New York. 

A City grew out and then in — 
it was always the way, whether 
or not it had a Barrier around it. 



Growing, -it crippled itself and 
its people — and died. The weeds 
overgrew its felled stones. 

"Like an egg," B. J. said, although he had not spoken. 
"Omne ex ovum — but the eggshell has to break." 

"I know," said Alvah, discovering that the empty ache in his 
belly was not sentiment but 
hunger. "Speaking of eggs — " 

B. J. gave his arm a reassuring 
little pat. "Anything you want, 
dear. Radnip, orangoe, pearots, 
fleetmeat — you pick the menu." 

Alvah's mouth began to water.
