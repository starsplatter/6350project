LULUNGOMEENA By GORDON R. DICKSON 

BLAME Clay Harbank, if 
you will, for what happened at Station 563 of 
the Sirius Sector; or blame William Peterborough, whom we 
called the Kid. I blame no one. 
But I am a Dorsai man. 

The trouble began the day 
the kid joined the station, with 
his quick hands and his gambler's 
mind, and found that Clay, alone 
of all the men there, would 
not gamble with him — for all that 
he claimed to having been a gambling man himself. And so it ran 
on for four years of service together. 

But the beginning of the end 
was the day they came off shift 
together. 

They had been out on a duty 
circuit of the frontier station that 
housed the twenty of us — searching the outer bubble for signs of 
blows or leaks. It's a slow two 
hour tramp, that duty, even outside the station on the surface of 
the asteroid where there's no 
gravity to speak of. We, in the 
recreation room, off duty, could 
tell by the sound of their voices 
as the inner port sucked open 
and the clanging clash of them 
removing their spacesuits came 
echoing to us along the metal 
corridor, that the Kid had been 
needling Clay through the whole 
tour. 

"Another day," came the Kid's 
voice, "another fifty credits. And 

71 



how's the piggy bank coming 
along, Clay?" 

7T1HERE was a slight pause, and 
-■- I could see Clay carefully 
controlling his features and his 
voice. Then his pleasant baritone, 
softened by the burr of his Tarsusian accent, came smoothly to 
us. 

"Like a gentleman, Kid,'* he 
answered. "He never overeats and 
so he runs no danger of indigestion." 

It was a neat answer, based on 
the fact that the Kid's own service account was swollen with his 
winnings from the rest of the 
crew. But the Kid was too thickskinned for rapier thrusts. He 
laughed; and they finished removing their equipment and came 
on into the recreation room. 

They made a striking picture 
as they entered, for they were 
enough alike to be brothers — although father and son would have 
been a more likely relationship, 
considering the difference in their 
ages. Both were tall, dark, wideshouldered men with lean faces, 
but experience had weathered 
the softer lines from Clay's face 
and drawn thin parentheses about 
the corners of his mouth. There 
were other differences, too; but 
you could see in the Kid the 
youth that Clay had been, and in 
Clay the man that the Kid would 
some day be. 



"Hi, Clay," I said. 

"Hello, Mort," he said, sitting 
down beside me. 

"Hi, Mort," said the Kid. 

I ignored him; and for a moment he tensed. I could see the 
anger flame up in the ebony 
depths of his black pupils under 
the heavy eyebrows. He was a big 
man; but I come from the Dorsai 
Planets and a Dorsai man fights 
to the death, if he fights at all. 
And, in consequence, among ourselves, we of Dorsai are a polite 
people. 

But politeness was wasted on 
the Kid — as was Clay's delicate 
irony. With men like the Kid, 
you have to use a club. 

We were in bad shape. The 
twenty of us at Frontier Station 
563, on the periphery of the human area just beyond Sirius, had 
gone sour, and half the men had 
applications in for transfer. The 
trouble between Clay and the 
Kid was splitting the station wide 
open. 

We were all in the Frontier 
Service for money; that was the 
root of the trouble. Fifty credits 
a day is good pay — but you have 
to sign up for a ten year hitch. 
You can buy yourself out — but 
that costs a hundred thousand. 
Figure it out for yourself. Nearly 
six years if you saved every penny 
you got. So most go in with the 
idea of staying the full decade. 

That was Clay's idea. He had 



72 




 



gambled most of his life away. 
He had won and lost several 
fortunes. Now he was getting old 
and tired and he wanted to go 
back — to Lulungomeena, on the 
little planet of Tarsus, which was 
the place he had come from as a 
young man. 

But he was through with gambling. He said money made that 
way never stuck, but ran away 
again like quicksilver. So he drew 
his pay and banked it. 

But the Kid was out for a 
killing. Four years of play with 
the rest of the crew had given 
him more than enough to buy his 
way out and leave him a nice 
stake. And perhaps he would have 
done just that, if it hadn't been 
that the Service account of Clay's 
drew him like an El Dorado. He 
could not go off and leave it. So 
he stayed with the outfit, riding the older man unmercifully. 

TTE harped continually on two 
themes. He pretended to disbelieve that Clay had ever been 
a gambler; and he derided Lulungomeena, Clay's birthplace : 
the older man's goal and dream, 
and the one thing he could be 
drawn into talk about. For, to 
Clay, Lulungomeena was beautiful, the most wonderful spot in 
the Universe; and with an old 
man's sick longing for home, he 
could not help sayirfg so. 

"Mort," said the Kid, ignoring 



the rebuff and sitting down beside us, "what's a Hixabrod like?" 

My club had not worked so 
well, after all. Perhaps, I, too, 
was slipping. Next to Clay, I was 
the oldest man on the crew, which 
was why we were close friends. 
I scowled at the Kid. 

"Why?" I asked. 

"We're having one for a visi- tor," he said. 

Immediately, all talk around 
the recreation room ceased and 
all attention was focused on the 
Kid. All aliens had to clear 
through a station like ours when 
they crossed the frontier from 
one of the other great galactic 
power groups into human territory. But isolated as Station 563 
was, it was seldom an alien came 
our way, and when one did, it 
was an occasion. 

Even Clay succumbed to the 
general interest. "I didn't know 
that," he said. "How'd you find 
out?" 

"The notice came in over the 
receiver when you were down 
checking the atmosphere plant," 
answered the Kid with a careless 
wave of his hand. "I'd already 
filed it when you came up. 
What'U he be like, Mort?" 

I had knocked around more 
than any of them — even Clay. 
This was my second stretch in 
the Service. I remembered back 
about twenty years, to the Denebian Trouble. 



LULUNGOMEENA

"Stiff as a poker," I said. 
"Proud as Lucifer, honest as sunlight and tight as a camel on his 
way through the eye of a needle. 
Sort of a humanoid, but with a 
face like a collie dog. You know 
the Hixabrodian reputation, don't 
you?" 

Somebody at the back of the 
crowd said no, although they may 
have been doing it just to humor 
me. Like Clay with his Lulungomeena, old age was making me 
garrulous. 

"They're the first and only 
mercenary ambassadors in the 
known Universe," I said. "A 
Hixabrod can be hired, but he 
can't be influenced, bribed or 
forced to come up with anything 
but the cold truth — and, brother, 
it's cold the way a Hixabrod 
serves it up to you. That's why 
they're so much in demand. If 
any kind of political dispute 
comes up, from planetary to inter-alien power group levels, 
both sides have to hire a Hixabrod to represent them in the 
discussions. That way they know 
the other side is being honest with 
them. The opposing Hixabrod is 
a living guarantee of that." 

"He sounds good," said the 
Kid. "What say we get together 
and throw him a good dinner 
during his twenty-four hour stopover?" 

"You won't get much in the 
way of thanks from him," I 



grunted. "They aren't built that 
way." 

"Let's do it anyway," said the 
Kid. "Be a little excitement for 
a change." 

A MURMUR of approval ran 
through the room. I was outvoted. Even Clay liked the idea. 

"Hixabrods eat what we eat, 
don't they?" asked the Kid, making plans. "Okay, then, soups, 
salad, meats, champagne and 
brandy — " he ran on, ticking the 
items off on his fingers. For a 
moment, his enthusiasm had us 
all with him. But then, just at 
the end, he couldn't resist getting 
in one more dig at Clay. 

"Oh, yes," he finished, "and for 
entertainment, you can tell him 
about Lulungomeena, Clay." 

Clay winced — not obviously, 
but we all saw a shadow cross 
his face. Lulungomeena on Tarsus, his birthplace, held the same 
sort of obsession for him that his 
Service account held for the Kid; 
but he could not help being aware 
that he was prone to let his tongue 
run away on the subject of its 
beauty. For it was where he belonged, in the stomach-twisting, 
throat-aching way that sometimes only talk can relieve. 

I was a Dorsai man and older 
than the rest. I understood. No 
one should make fun of the bond 
tying a man to his home world. 
It is as real as it is intangible. 



74 




 



And to joke about it is cruel. 

But the Kid was too young to 
know that yet. He was fresh from 
Earth — Earth, where none of the 
rest of us had been, yet which, 
hundreds of years before, had 
been the origin of us all. He was 
eager and strong and contemptuous of emotion. He saw, as the 
rest of us recognized also, that 
Clay's tendency to let his talk 
wander ever to the wonder of 
Lulungomeena was the first slight 
crack in what had once been a 
man of unflawed steel. It was the 
first creeping decay of age. 

But, unlike the rest of us, who 
hid our boredom out of sympathy, the Kid saw here a chance 
to break Clay and his resolution 
to do no more gambling. So he 
struck out constantly at this one 
spot so deeply vital that Clay's 
self-possession was no defense. 

Now, at this last blow, the 
little fires of anger gathered in 
the older man's eyes. 

"That's enough," he said 
harshly. "Leave Lulungomeena 
out of the discussion." 

"I'm willing to," said the Kid. 
"But somehow you keep reminding me of it. That and the story 
that you once were a gambler. If 
you won't prove the last one, 
how can you expect me to believe all you say about the first?" 

The veins stood out on Clay's 
forehead; but he controlled himself. 



"I've told you a thousand 
times," he said between bis teeth. 
"Money made by gambling 
doesn't stick. YouH find that out 
for yourself one of these days." 

"Words," said the Kid airily. 
"Only words." 

For a second, Clay stood staring whitely at him, not even 
breathing. I don't know if the 
Kid realized his danger or cared, 
but I didn't breathe, either, until 
Clay's chest expanded and he 
turned abruptly and walked out 
of the recreation room. We heard 
his bootsteps die away down the 
corridor toward his room in the 
dormitory section. 

T ATER, I braced the Kid about 
it. It was his second shift 
time, when most of the men in 
the recreation room had to go on 
duty. I ran the Kid to the ground 
in the galley where he was fixing 
himself a sandwich. He looked 
up, a little startled, more than a 
little on the defensive, as I came 
in. 

"Oh, hi, Mort," he said, with a 
pretty good imitation of casualness. "What's up?" 

"You," I told him. "Are you 
looking for a fight with Clay?" 

"No," he drawled with his 
mouth full. "I wouldn't exactly 
say that." 

"Well, that's what you're liable 
to get." 

"Look, Mort," he said, and 



LULUNGOMEENA

then paused until he had swallowed. "Don't you think Clay's 
old enough to look after himself?" 

I felt a slight and not unpleasant shiver run down between my 
shoulder-blades and my eyes began to grow hot. It was my 
Dorsai blood again. It must have 
showed on my face, for the Kid, 
who had been sitting negligently 
on one edge of the galley table, 
got up in a hurry. 

"Hold on, Mort," he said. 
"Nothing personal." 

I fought the old feeling down 
and said as calmly as I could, 
"I just dropped by to tell you 
something. Clay has been around 
a lot longer than you have. I'd 
advise you to lay off him." 

"Afraid he'll get hurt?" 

"No," I answered. "I'm afraid 
you will." 

The Kid snorted with sudden 
laughter, half choking on his 
sandwich. "Now I get it. You 
think I'm too young to take care 
of myself." 

"Something like that, but not 
the way you think. I want to tell 
you something about yourself and 
you don't have to say whether 
I'm right or wrong — you'll let me 
know without words." 

"Hold it," he said, turning red. 
"I didn't come out here to get 
psyched." 

"You'll get it just the same. 
And it's not for you only — it's for 



all of us, because men thrown 
together as closely as we are 
choose up sides whenever there's 
conflict, and that's as dangerous 
for the rest of us as it is for you." 

"Then the rest of you can 
stay out of it." 

"We can't," I said. "What affects one of us affects us all. 
Now I'll tell you what you're 
doing. You came out here expecting to find glamor and excitement. You found monotony 
and boredom instead, not realizing that that's what space is like 
almost all the time." 

TIE picked up his coffee container. "And now you'll say 
I'm trying to create my own excitement at Clay's expense. Isn't 
that tire standard line?" 

"I wouldn't know; I'm not going to use it, because that's not 
how I see what you're doing. 
Clay is adult enough to stand the 
monotony and boredom if they'll 
get him what he wants. He's also 
learned how to live with others 
and with himself. He doesn't have 
to prove himself by beating down 
somebody either half or twice his 
age." 

He took a drink and set the 
container down on the table. "And 
I do?" 

"All youngsters do. It's their 
way of experimenting with their 
potentialities and relationships 
with other people. When they find 



76 




 



that out, they can give it up — 
they're mature then — although 
some never do. I think you will, 
eventually. The sooner you stop 
doing it here, though, the better 
it'll be for you and us." 

"And if I don't?" he challenged. 

"This isn't college back on 
Earth or some other nice, safe 
home planet, where hazing can 
be a nuisance, but where it's possible to escape it by going somewhere else. There isn't any 'somewhere else' here. Unless the one 
doing the hazing sees how reckless 
and dangerous it is, the one getting hazed takes it as long as he 
can — and then something happens." 

"So it's Clay you're really worried about, after all." 

"Look, get it through your 
skull. Clay's a man and he's been 
through worse than this before. 
You haven't. If anybody's going 
to get hurt, it'll be you." 

He laughed and headed for the 
corridor door. He was still laughing as it slammed behind him. I 
let him go. There's no use pushing a bluff after it's failed to 
work. 

PT^HE next day, the Hixabrod 
came. His name was Dor 
Lassos. He was typical of his 
race, taller than the tallest of us 
by half a head, with a light green 
skin and that impassive Hixa


brodian canine face. 

I missed his actual arrival, being up in the observation tower 
checking meteor paths. The station itself was well protected, but 
some of the ships coming in from 
time to time could have gotten in 
trouble with a few of the larger 
ones that slipped by us at intervals in that particular sector. 
When I did get free, Dor Lassos 
had already been assigned to his 
quarters and the time of official 
welcoming was over. 

I went down to see him anyhow on the off-chance that we 
had mutual acquaintances either 
among his race or mine. Both of 
our peoples are few enough in 
number, God knows, so the possibility wasn't too far-fetched. 
And, like Clay, I yearned for anything connected with my home. 

"Wet velt cThatchen, Hixabrod — " I began, walking into his 
apartment — and stopped short. 

The Kid was there. He looked 
at me with an odd expression 
on his face. 

"Do you speak Hixabrodian?" 
he asked incredulously. 

I nodded. I had learned it on 
extended duty during the Denebian Trouble. Then I remembered 
my manners and turned back to 
the Hixabrod; but he was already started on his answer. 

"En gles Ter, I tu, Dorsaiven," 
returned the collie face, expressionlessly. "Da Tr'amgen lang. 



LULUNGOMEEN A

Met zurres nebent?" 
. "Em getluc. Me mi Dorsai 
fene. Nono ne — ves luc Les Lassos?" 

He shook his head. 

Well, it had been a shot in the 
dark anyway. There was only the 
faintest chance that he had known 
our old interpreter at the time of 
the Denebian Trouble. The Hixabrods have no family system of 
nomenclature. They take their 
names from the names of older 
Hixabrods they admire or like. I 
bowed politely to him and left. 

It was not until later that it 
occurred to me to wonder what 
in the Universe the Kid could' 
find to talk about with a Hixabrod. 

T ACTUALLY was worried 
about Clay. Since my bluff 
with the Kid had failed, I 
thought I might perhaps try with 
Clay himself. At first I waited 
for an opportune moment to 
turn up; but following the last 
argument with the Kid, he'd been 
sticking to his quarters. I finally 
scrapped the casual approach and 
went to see him. 

I found him in his quarters, 
reading. It was a little shocking 
to find that tall, still athletic figure in a dressing gown like an old 
man, eyes shaded by the lean 
fingers of one long hand, poring 
over the little glow of a scanner 
with the lines unreeling before his 



eyes. But he looked up as I came 
in, and the smile on his face was 
the smile I had grown familiar 
with over four years of close 
living together. 

"What's that?" I asked, nodding at the book scanner. 

He set it down and the little 
light went out, the lines stopped 
unreeling. 

"A bad novel," he said, smiling, 
"by a poor author. But they're 
both Tarsusian." 

I took the chair he had indicated. "Mind if I speak straight 
out, Clay?" 

"Go ahead," he invited. 

"The Kid," I said bluntly. 
"And you. The two of you can't 
go on this way." 

"Well, old fire-eater," answered 
Clay lightly, "what've you got to 
suggest?" 

"Two things. And I want you 
to think both of them over carefully before answering. First, we 
see if we can't get up a ninetenths majority here in the station and petition him out as incompatible." 

CLAY slowly shook his head. 
"We can't do that, Mort." 
"I think I can get the signatures if I ask it," I said. "Everybody's pretty tired of him . . . 
They'd come across." 

"It's not that and you know 
it," said Clay. "Transfer by petition isn't supposed to be preju

dicial, but you and I know it is. 
He'd be switched to some hardcase station, get in worse trouble 
there, and end up in a penal post 
generally shot to hell. He'd know 
who to blame for it, and he'd 
hate us for the rest of his life." 

"What of it? Let him hate us." 

"I'm a Tarsusian. It'd bother 
me and I couldn't do it." 

"All right," I said. "Dropping 
that, "then, you've got nearly 
seven years in, total, and half the 
funds you need to buy out. I've 
got nearly enough saved, in spite 
of myself, to make up the rest. 
In addition, for your retirement, 
I'll sign over to you my pay for 
the three years I've got left. Take 
that and get out of the Service. 
It isn't what you figured on having, but half a loaf . . ." 

"And how about your homegoing?" he asked. 

"Look at me." 

He looked; and I knew what he 
was seeing — the broken nose, the 
scars, the lined face — the Dorsai 
face. 

"I'll never go home," I said. 

He sat looking at me for a long 
moment more, and I fancied I 
saw a little light burn deep in 
back of his eyes. But then the 
light went out and I knew that 
I'd lost with him, too. 

"Maybe not," he said quietly. 
"But I'm not going to be the one 
that keeps you from it." 

I left him to his book. 



OHIFTS are supposed to run 
^ continuously, with someone 
on duty all the time. However, 
for special occasions, like this 
dinner we had arranged for the 
Hixabrod, it was possible, by 
getting work done ahead of time 
and picking the one four hour 
stretch during the twenty-four 
when there were no messages or 
ships due in, to assemble everybody in the station on an offduty basis. 

So we were all there that evening, in the recreation room, 
which had been cleared and set 
up with a long table for the 
dinner. We finished our cocktails, 
sat down at the table and the 
meal began. 

As it will, the talk during the 
various courses turned to things 
outside the narrow limits of our 
present lives. Remembrances of 
places visited, memories of an 
earlier life, and the comparison 
of experiences, some of them 
pretty weird, were the materials 
of which our table talk was built. 

Unconsciously, all of us were 
trying to draw the Hixabrod out. 
But he sat in his place at the 
head of the table between Clay 
and myself, with the Kid a little 
farther down, preserving a frosty 
silence until the dessert had been 
disposed of and the subject of 
Media unepectedly came up. 

"—Media," said the Kid. "I've 
heard of Media. It's a little 



IUIUNGOMEEN A

planet, but it's supposed to have 
everything from soup to nuts on 
it in the way of life. There's 
one little life-form there that's 
claimed to contain something of 
value to every metabolism. It's 
called — let me see now — it's 
called—" 

"It is called nygti," supplied 
Dor Lassos, suddenly, in a metallic voice. "A small quadruped 
with a highly complex nervous 
system and a good deal of fatty 
tissue. I visited the planet over 
eighty years ago, before it was 
actually opened up to general 
travel. The food stores spoiled 
and we had the opportunity of 
testing out the theory that it will 
provide sustenance for almost any 
kind of known intelligent being." 

He stopped. 

"TfTELL?" demanded the Kid. 

"Since you're here to tell 
the story, I assume the animal 
kept you alive." 

"I and the humans aboard the 
ship found the nygti quite nourishing," said Dor Lassos. "Unfortunately, we had several Micrushni from Polaris also 
aboard." 

"And those?" asked someone. 

"A highly developed but inelastic life-form," said Dor 
Lassos, sipping from his brandy 
glass. "They went into convulsions and died." 

I had had some experience 



with Hixabrodian ways and I 
knew that it was not sadism, but 
a complete detachment that had 
prompted this little anecdote. 
But I could see a wave of distaste ripple down the room. No 
life-form is so universally well 
liked as the Micrushni, a delicate 
iridescent jellyfishlike race with 
a bent toward poetry and philosophy. 

The men at the table" drew 
away almost visibly from Dor 
Lassos. But that affected him no 
more than if they had applauded 
loudly. Only in very limited ways 
are the Hixabrod capable of empathy where other races are concerned. 

"That's too bad," said Clay 
slowly. "I have always liked the 
Micrushni." He had been drinking somewhat heavily and the 
seemingly innocuous statement 
came out like a half-challenge. 

Dor Lassos' cold brown eyes 
turned and rested on him. Whatever he saw, whatever conclusions he came to, however, were 
hidden behind his emotionless 
face. 

"In general," he said flatly, "a 
truthful race." 

That was the closest a Hixabrod could come to praise, and I 
expected the matter to drop there. 
But the Kid spoke up again. 

"Not like us humans," he said. 
"Eh, Dor Lassos?" 

I glared at him from behind 



80 




 



Dor Lassos' head. But he went 
recklessly on. 

"I said, 'Not like us humans, 
eh?'" he repeated loudly. The 
Kid had also apparently been 
drinking freely, and his voice 
grated on the sudden silence of 
the room. 

"The human race varies," 
stated the Hixabrod emotionlessly. "You have some individuals 
who approach truth. Otherwise, 
the human race is not notably 
truthful." 

It was a typical, deadly accurate Hixabrodian response. Dor 
Lassos would have answered in 
the same words if his throat was 
to have been cut for them the 
minute they left his mouth. 
Again, it should have shut the 
Kid up, and again it apparently 
failed. 

"Ah, yes," said the Kid. "Some 
approach truth, but in general 
we are untruthful. But you see, 
Dor Lassos, a certain amount of 
human humor is associated with 
lies. Some of us tell lies just for 
fun." 

r|OR Lassos drank from his 
brandy glass and said nothing. 

"Of course," the Kid went on, 
"sometimes a human thinks he's 
being funny with his lies when he 
isn't. Some lies are just boring, 
particularly when you're forced 
to hear them over and over again. 



But on the other hand, there are 
some champion liars who are so 
good that even you would find 
their untruths humorous." 

Clay sat upright suddenly, and 
the sudden start of his movement 
sent the brandy slopping out over 
the rim of his glass and onto the 
white tablecloth. He stared at the 
Kid. 

I looked at them all — at Clay, 
at the Kid and at Dor Lassos; 
and an ugly premonition began 
to form in my brain. 

"I do not believe I should," 
said Dor Lassos. 

"Ah, but you should listen to a 
real expert," said the Kid feverishly, "when he has a good subject to work on. Now, for example, take the matter of home 
worlds. What is your home world, 
Hixa, like?" 

I had heard enough and more 
than enough to confirm the suspicion forming within me. Without drawing any undue attention 
to myself, I rose and left the 
room. 

The alien made a dry sound in 
his throat and his voice followed 
me as I went swiftly down the 
empty corridor. 

"It is very beautiful," he said 
in his adding machine tones. 
"Hixa has a diameter of thirtyeight thousand universal meters. 
It possesses twenty-three great 
mountain ranges and seventeen 
large bodies of salt water . . ."

81 



The sound of his voice died 
away and I left it behind me. 

I went directly through the 
empty corridors and up the ladder to the communications shack. 
I went in the door without pausing, without — in neglect of all 
duty rules — glancing at the automatic printer to see if any fresh 
message out of routine had arrived, without bothering to check 
the transmitter to see that it was 
keyed into the automatic location signal for approaching spacecraft. 

All this I ignored and went 
directly to the file where the incoming messages are kept. 

I flicked the tab and went back 
to the file of two days previous, 
skimming through the thick sheaf 
of transcripts under that dateline. 
And there, beneath the heading 
"Notices of Arrivals," I found it, 
the message announcing the coming of Dor Lassos. I ran my finger 
down past the statistics on our 
guest to the line of type that told 
me where the Hixabrod's last 
stop had been. 

Tarsus. 

/^LAY was my friend. And 
^ there is a limit to what a 
man can take without breaking. 
On a wall of the communications 
shack was a roster of the men at 
our station. I drew the Dorsai 
sign against the name of William 
Peterborough, and checked my 



gun out of the arms locker. 

I examined the magazine. It 
was loaded. I replaced the magazine, put the gun inside my jacket, and went back to the dinner. 

Dor Lassos was still talking. 

". . . The flora and the fauna 
are maintained in such excellent 
natural balance that no local 
surplus has exceeded one per cent 
of the normal population for any 
species in the last sixty thousand 
years. Life on Hixa is regular and 
predictable. The weather is controlled within the greatest limits 
of feasibility." 

As I took my seat, the machine 
voice of the Hixabrod hesitated 
for just a moment, then gathered 
itself, and went on: "One day I 
shall return there." 

"A pretty picture," said the 
Kid. He was leaning forward over 
the table now, his eyes bright, his 
teeth bared in a smile. "A very 
attractive home world. But I regret to inform you, Dor Lassos, 
that I've been given to understand that it pales into insignificance when compared - to one 
other spot in the Galaxy." 

The Hixabrod are warriors, too. 
Dor Lassos' features remained expressionless, but his voice deepened and rang through the room. 

"Your planet?" 

"I wish it were," returned the 
Kid with the same wolfish smile. 
"I wish I could lay claim to it. 
But this place is so wonderful 



82 




 



that I doubt if I would be allowed there. In fact," the Kid went 
on, "I have never seen it. But I 
have been hearing about it for 
some years now. And either it is 
the most wonderful place in the 
Universe, or else the man who 
has been telling me about it — " 
I pushed my chair back and 
started to rise, but Clay's hand 
clamped on my arm and held me 
down. 

"You were saying — " he said to 
the Kid, who had been interrupted by my movement. 

" — The man who has been telling me about it," said the Kid, 
deliberately, "is one of those 
champion liars I was telling Dor 
Lassos about." 

Once more "I tried to get to my 
feet, but Clay was there before 
me. Tall and stiff, he stood at the 
end of the table. 

"My right — " he said out of 
the corner of his moUth to me. 

Slowly and with meaning, he 
picked up his brandy glass and 
threw the glass straight into the 
Kid's face. It bounced on the 
table in front of him and sent 
brandy flying over the front of 
the Kid's immaculate dress uniform. 

"Get your gun!" ordered Clay. 

TVTOW the Kid was on his feet. 
-"■^ In spite of the fact that I 
knew he had planned this, emotion had gotten the better of him 



at the end. His face was white 
with rage. He leaned on the edge 
of the table and fought with himself to carry it through as he had 
originally intended. 

"Why guns?" he said. His voice 
was thick with restraint, as he 
struggled to control himself. 

"You called me a liar." 

"Will guns tell me if you are?" 
The Kid straightened up, breathing more easily; and his laugh 
was harsh in the room. "Why use 
guns when it's possible to prove 
the thing one way or another with 
complete certainty?" His gaze 
swept the room and came back 
to Clay. 

"For years now you've been 
telling me all sorts of things," 
he said. "But two things you've 
told me more than all the rest. 
One was that you used to be a 
gambler. The other was that Lulungomeena — your precious Lulungomeena on Tarsus — was the 
most wonderful place in the Universe. Is either one of those the. 
truth?" 

Clay's breath came thick and 
slow. 

"They're both the truth," he 
said, fighting to keep his voice 
steady. 

"Will you back that up?" 

"With my life!" 

"Ah," said the Kid mockingly, 
holding up his forefinger, "but 
I'm not asking you to back those 
statements up with your life — 



LULUNGOMEEN A 



83 



but with that neat little hoard 
you've been accumulating these 
past years. You claimed you're a 
gambler. Will you bet that those 
statements are true?" 

Now, for the first time, Clay 
seemed to see the trap. 

"Bet with me," invited the Kid, 
almost lightly. "That will prove 
the first statement." 

"And what about the second?" 
demanded Clay. 

"Why—" the Kid gestured with 
his hand toward Dor Lassos — 
"what further judge do we need? 
We have here at our table a Hixabrod." Half-turning to the alien, 
the Kid made him a little bow. 
"Let him say whether your second statement is true or not." 

Once more I tried to rise from 
my seat and again Clay's hand 
shoved me down. He turned to 
Dor Lassos. 

"Do you think you could judge 
such a point, sir?" he asked. 

The brown inhuman eyes met 
pis and held for a long moment. 

"I have just come from Tarsus," said the Hixabrod. "I was 
there as a member of the Galactic Survey Team, mapping the 
planet. It was my duty to certify 
to the truth of the map." 

npHE choice was no choice. 

Clay stood staring at the Hixabrod as the room waited for his 
answer. Rage burning within me, 
I looked down the table for a 



sign in the faces of the others that 
this thing might be stopped. But 
where I expected to see sympathy, there was nothing. Instead, 
there was blankness, or cynicism, 
or even the wet-lipped interest of 
men who like their excitement 
written in blood or tears. 

And I realized with a sudden 
sinking of hopes that I stood 
alone, after all, as Clay's friend. 
In my own approaching age and 
garrulity I had not minded his 
talk of Lulungomeena, hour on 
repetitive hour. But these others 
had grown weary of it. Where I 
saw tragedy, they saw only retribution coming to a lying bore. 

And what Clay saw was what 
I saw. His eyes went dark and 
cold. 

"How much will you bet?" he 
asked. 

"All I've got," responded the 
Kid, leaning forward eagerly. 
"Enough and more than enough 
to match that bank roll of yours. 
• The equivalent of eight years' 
pay." 

Stiffly, without a word, Clay 
produced his savings book and a 
voucher pad. He wrote out a 
voucher for the whole amount 
and laid book and voucher on the 
table before Dor Lassos. The Kid, 
who had obviously come prepared, did the same, adding a 
thick pile of cash from his gambling of recent weeks. 

"That's all of it?" asked Clay. 



84 




 



"All of it," said the Kid. 
Clay nodded and stepped back. 
"Go ahead," he said. 
The Kid turned toward the 
alien. 

"Dor Lassos," he said. "We appreciate your cooperation in this 
matter." 

"I am glad to hear it," responded the Hixabrod, "since my cooperation will cost the winner of 
the bet a thousand credits." 

The abrupt injection of this 
commercial note threw the Kid 
momentarily off stride. I, alone 
in the room, who knew the Hixabrod people, had expected it. But 
the rest had not, and it struck a 
sour note, which reflected back 
on the Kid. Up until now, the bet 
had seemed to most of the others 
like a cruel but at least honest 
game, concerning ourselves only. 
Suddenly it had become a little 
like hiring a paid bully to beat up 
a stationmate. 

But it was too late now to stop ; 
the bet had been made. Nevertheless, there were murmurs from 
different parts of the room. 

fFlHE Kid hurried on, fearful of 
an interruption. Clay's savings 
were on his mind. 

"You were a member of the 
mapping survey team?" he asked 
Dor Lassos. 

"I was," said the Hixabrod. 

"Then you know the planet?" 

"I do." 



. "You know its geography?" insisted the Kid. 

"I do not repeat myself." The 
eyes of the Hixabrod were chill 
and withdrawn, almost a little 
baleful, as they met those of the 
Kid. 

"What kind of a planet is it?" 
The Kid licked his lips. He was 
beginning to recover his usual 
self-assurance. "Is it a large 
planet?" 

"No." 

"Is Tarsus a rich planet?" 
"No." 

"Is it a pretty planet?" 

"I did not find it so." 

"Get to the point.'" snapped 
Clay with strained harshness. 

The Kid glanced at him, savoring this moment. He turned back 
to the Hixabrod. 

"Very well, Dor Lassos," he 
said, "we get to the meat of the 
matter. Have you ever heard of 
Lulungomeena ?" 

"Yes." 

"Have you ever been to Lulungomeena?" 
"I have." 

"And do you truthfully — " for 
the first time, a fierce and burning anger flashed momentarily in 
the eyes of the Hixabrod; the insult the Kid had just unthinkingly given Dor Lassos was a deadly 
one — "truthfully say that in your 
considered opinion Lulungomeena is the most wonderful 
place in the Universe?" 



LULUNGOMEENA

Dor Lassos turned his gaze 
away from him and let it wander 
over the rest of the room. Now, 
at last, his contempt for all there 
was plain to be read on his face. 

"Yes, it is," said Dor Lassos. 

TTE rose to his feet at the head 
of the stunned group around 
the table. From the pile of cash 
he extracted a thousand credits, 
then passed the remainder, along 
with the two account books and 
the vouchers, to Clay. Then he 
took one step toward the Kid. 

He halted before him and offered his hands to the man — 
palms up, the tips of his fingers 
a scant couple of inches short of 
the Kid's face. 

"My hands are clean," he said. 

His fingers arced; and, suddenly, as we watched, stubby, gleaming claws shot smoothly from 
those fingertips to tremble lightly 
against the skin of the Kid's face. 

"Do you doubt the truthfulness 
of a Hixabrod?" his robot voice 
asked. 

The Kid's face was white and 
his cheeks hollowed in fear. The 
needle points of the claws were 
very close to his eyes. He swallowed once. 

"No — " he whispered. 

The claws retracted. The hands 
returned to their owner's sides. 
Once more completely withdrawn 
and impersonal, Dor Lassos turned and bowed to us all. 




"My appreciation of your 
courtesy," he said, the metallic 
tones of his voice loud in the silence. 

Then he turned and, marching 
like a metronome, disappeared 
through the doorway of the recreation room and off in the direction of his quarters. 

" A ND so we part," said Clay 
Harbank as we shook hands. 
"I hope you find the Dorsai Planets as welcome as I intend to find 
Lulungomeena." 



86 




 



I grumbled a little. "That was 
plain damn foolishness. You 
didn't have to buy me out as 
well." 

"There were more than enough 
credits for the both of us," said 
Clay. 

It was a month after the bet 
and the two of us were standing 
in the Deneb One spaceport. For 
miles in every direction, the great 
echoing building of this central 
terminal stretched around us. In 
ten minutes I was due to board 
my ship for the Dorsai Planets. 



Clay himself still had several 
days to wait before one of the 
infrequent ships to Tarsus would 
be ready to leave. 

"The bet itself was damn foolishness," I went on, determined 
to find something to complain 
about. We Dorsai do not enjoy 
these moments of emotion. But a 
Dorsai is a Dorsai. I am not apologizing. 

• "No foolishness," said Clay. 
For a moment a shadow crossed 
his face. "You forget that a real 
gambler bets only on a sure 



LULUNGOMEEN A 



87 



thing. When I looked into the 
Hixabrod's eyes, I was sure." 

"How can you say 'a sure 
thing?' " 

"The Hixabrod loved his 
home," Clay said. 

I stared at him, astounded. 
"But you weren't betting on 
Hixa. Of course he would prefer 
Hixa to any other place in the 
Universe. But you were betting 
on Tarsus — on Lulungomeena — 
remember?" 

The shadow was back for a 
moment on Clay's face. "The bet 
was certain. I feel a little guilty 
about the Kid, but I warned him 
that gambling money never 
stuck. Besides, he's young and 
I'm getting old. I couldn't afford 
to lose." 

"Will you come down out of 
the clouds," I demanded, "and 
explain this thing? Why was the 



bet certain? What was the trick, 
if there was one?" 

"The trick?" repeated Clay. 
He smiled at me. "The trick was 
that the Hixabrod could not be 
otherwise than truthful. It was 
all in the name of my birthplace 
— Lulungomeena." 

He looked at my puzzled face 
and put a hand on my shoulder. 

"You see, Mort," he said quietly, "it was the name that fooled 
everybody. Lulungomeena stands 
for something in my language. 
But not for any city or town or 
village. Everybody on Tarsus has 
his own Lulungomeena. Everybody in the Universe has." 

"How do you figure that, 
Clay?" 

"It's a word," he explained. 
"A word in the Tarsusian language. It means 'home.' "
