How long since 
your last raise? 

Sure, you've had a "cost of living increase." But what about the htg 
pay boost?— the kind the bos* asks you not to talk about and the kind 
that starts you thinking about a new car, a better home, luxuries for 
your family ! 

If you've had one of these in the past six months, stop reading 
right here. If not, it's time to start doing something about it. 

Look around you. The men who are advancing are the trained 
men. They've learned special skills that bring them higher pay. It's 
the men without training who get what's left. 

What arc you gwtlg to do about it? Just wait and hope for the 
jackpot to pay otf ? If you really w ant the lig money, you can start 
by getting the necessary training at home in your spare time.

What Strange Powers 

Did The Ancients Possess? 




EVERY important discovery relating 
to mind power, sound thinking and 
cause and effect, as applied to selfadvancement, was known centuries ago, 
before the masses could read and write. 

Much has been written about the wise 
men of old. A popular fallacy has it that 
their secrets of personal power and successful living were lost to the world. 
Knowledge of nature's laws, accumulated through the ages, is never lost. At 
times the great truths possessed by the 
sages were hidden from unscrupulous 
men in high places, but never destroyed. 

Why Were Their Secrets 
Closely Guarded? 

Only recently, as time is measured; not 
more than twenty generations ago, less 
than l/100th of 1% of the earth's 
people were thought capable of receiving basic knowledge about the laws of 
life, for it is an elementary truism that 
knowledge is power and that power 
cannot be entrusted to the ignorant 
and the unworthy. 

Wisdom is not readily attainable by the 
general public; nor recognized when 
right within reach. The average person 
absorbs a multitude of details about 
things, but goes through life without 
ever knowing where and how to acquire 
mastery of the fundamentals of the inner 
mind — that mysterious silent something 
which "whispers" to you from within. 

Fundamental Laws of Nature 

Your habits, accomplishments and weaknesses are the effects of causes. Your 
thoughts and actions are governed by 
fundamental laws. Example : The law 



of compensation is as fundamental as 
the laws of breathing, eating and sleeping. All fixed laws of nature are as 
fascinating to study as they are vital to 
understand for success in life. 

You can learn to find and follow every 
basic law of life. You can begin at any 
time to discover a whole new world of 
interesting truths. You can start at once 
to awaken your inner powers of selfunderstanding and self-advancement. 
You can learn from one of the world's 
oldest institutions, first known in America in 1694. Enjoying the high regard 
of hundreds of leaders, thinkers and 
teachers, the order is known as the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. Its complete name 
is the "Ancient and Mystical Order 
Rosae Crucis," abbreviated by the initials "AMORC." The teachings of the 
Order are not sold, for it is not a commercial organization, nor is it a religious 
sect. It is a non-profit fraternity, a 
brotherhood in the true sense. 

Not For General Distribution 

Sincere men and women, in search of 
the truth — those who wish to fit in with 
the ways of the world — are invited to 
write for complimentary copy of the 
sealed booklet, "The Mastery of Life." 
It tells how to contact the librarian of 
the archives of AMORC for this rare 
knowledge. This booklet is not intended 
for general distribution; nor is it sent 
without request. It is therefore suggested 
that you write for your copy to: Scribe

MOVING DAY 



A S individuals, dinosaurs seldom died of old age. As a 
race, however, they lasted some 
100,000,000 years. 

As individuals, most of us 
manage to die of natural causes. 
As a race, however, we feel extinction approaching after less 
than 1,000,000 years. 

Purely on the basis of racial 
survival, it looks as if being a 
dinosaur was a better risk than 
being a man. 

I doubt if any dinosaurs 
thought for a second about carrying on the family name. There 
are other differences between 
them and mankind, but that's 
probably the most important 
one. 

Most people sound like dinosaurs on the question of survival ; 
they claim they're more interested in their own than humanity's. But the intense concern 
with racial doom indicates the 
opposite — few of us would find 
very much point in life if the 
race died. 

The dinosaurs never knew 
what hit them. One millenium, 
they were contentedly chewing 
up the countryside and each 
other; the next, they were gone. 
Even if they had known what 
was happening to them, they 
could not have stopped it. 



We do know, all too acutely, 
the threats facing us. Solving 
them is another matter, but we 
are aware of them, which is the 
first step in working out a problem. 

All right, now let's pick the 
most imminent threat. We each 
have our favorite, ranging from 
the effect of noise on the human 
organism to that of fusion on the 
atmosphere. Mine — for the purpose of this editorial, at least — is 
overpopulation. 

A century and a half ago, 
Malthus noted that population 
tends to increase more rapidly 
than food supply. That part of 
his argument makes sense, especially if rends is emphasized. The 
other part is more questionable: 
Unless birth is controlled, he said, 
increase must be checked by 
poverty and war. 

Well, the current annual increase is 25,000,000, which very 
naturally draws compound interest. ^ 

That's on the one hand. There 
are enough other hands to resemble Siva: 

Malthus would have called 
the size of the present population 
impossible. It is — for the technology of his day. Where agricultural techniques have kept 
pace with increase, food supplies 



4 




 



vary from adequate to glut. The 
pressure spots of the world, such 
as India and China, actually 
have lower rates of increase than 
elsewhere; their trouble is static 
agricultural methods. 

While most of the world has 
been growing in population, some 
countries, notably Ireland and 
France, have been confronted by 
falling birth rates. Why? Can it 
happen in other places? Incidentally, when it happens in a functioning economy, the result is as 
disastrous as growth is to a faltering one. 

The solutions Malthus gave — 
birth control, poverty (famine 
and disease) and war — haven't 
yet proved effective. The weapons we're building might be able 
to solve the problem, but only 
by creating a worse one. 

Mining the sea and synthesizing food could merely delay the 
final explosion. They're not answers in themselves. 

THE one suggested most often 
in science fiction is migration 
— moving whole populations to 
wherever there is room: other 
planets, reclaimed deserts, Amazonia, Africa, bubble cities under 
the ocean. 

Are the authors being realistic? 
Let's see if they are. 

The Nazis and Russians did 
move millions of people at a 
profit. But they were simply 



herded off, in freight cars or on 
foot, and worked as slaves. No 
attempt was made to resettle 
them as humans. All this, remember, was by land. If it had to be 
done by sea or air, I doubt if 
even the most callous packing 
would have been economical 
enough. 

To complicate matters, we humanely would provide decent 
transportation, at least minimally 
adequate housing, proper food, 
training in needed skills, and 
farms, factories, shops and labs. 
This is the resettlement program 
Israel is following — and the cost 
is crushing. 

The most modest goal we 
could settle for would be to 
siphon off the 25,000,000 extras 
per year. Whether by sea, air or 
spaceship, it would be a vast 
transportation job. But besides 
the gigantic fleets and rivers of 
fuel, we'd need enormous reception and training camps, mountainous food supplies, cadre 
armies, a relocation plan capable 
of almost infinite expansion to 
absorb so many people annually. 

No, the solution is not at all 
realistic — at present. Yet that is 
where we have the edge on the 
dinosaurs and those who think 
in saurian fashion: 

We know that one generation's 
impossibility is the next generation's commonplace. 

— H. L. GOLD

It was a world of wildest paradoxes— patriotism, for example,

ments and his habitually sullen 
expression enabled him to dominate any stage not occupied by 
an unclothed woman at least as 
large as himself. At twenty-six, 
he had a very respectable following among the housewives of 
Manhattan, Queens, Jersey and 
the rest of the seven boroughs. 
The percentage of blown fuses 
resulting from subscribers' attempts to clutch his realized 
image was extraordinarily low — 
Alvah, his press agents explained 
with perfect accuracy, left them 
too numb. 

Young Gustad, who frequently 
made his first entrance waterbeaded as from the shower, with 
a towel girded chastely around 
his loins, was nevertheless in his 
private life a modest and slightly 
bewildered citizen, much given to 
solitary reading, and equipped 
with a perfect set of the conventional virtues. 

These included cheerful performance of all municipal duties 
and obligations — like every rightthinking citizen, Gustad held 
down two jobs in summer and 
three in winter. At the moment, 
for example, he was an actor by 
day and a metals-reclamation 
supervisor by night. 

Chief among his less tangible 
attributes, was that emotion 
which in some ages has been 
variously described as civic pride 
or patriotism. In A.D. 2064, as 



in B.C. 400, they amounted to 
the same thing. 

"OEHIND the Manager's desk, 
the wall was a single huge 
slab of black duroplast, with a 
map of the city picked out in 
pinpoints of brilliance. As Gustad 
entered with his manager and his 
porter, an unseen chorus of basso 
profundos broke into the strains 
of The Slidewalks of New York. 
After four bars, it segued to New 
York, New York, It's a Pip of a 
Town and slowly faded out. 

The Manager himself, the Hon. 
Boleslaw Wytak, broke the reverent hush by coming forward to 
take Alvah's hand and lead him 
toward the desk. "Mr. Gustad — 
and Mr. Diamond, isn't it? Great 
pleasure to have you here. I don't 
know if you've met all these gentlemen. Commissioner Laurence, 
of the Department of Extramural 
Relations — Director Ostertag, of 
the Bureau of Vital Statistics — 
Chairman Neddo, of the Research 
and Development Board." 

Wytak waited until everyone 
was comfortably settled in one of 
the reclining chairs which fitted 
into slots in the desk, with cigars, 
cigarettes, liquor capsules and 
cold snacks at each man's elbow. 
"Now, Mr. Gustad — and Mr. 
Diamond — I'm a plain blunt man 
and I know you're wondering 
why I asked you to come here 
today. I'm going to tell you. The 



8 




 



City needs a man with great talent and great courage to do a job 
that, I tell you frankly, I wouldn't 
undertake myself without great 
misgivings." He gazed at Gustad 
warmly, affectionately but sternly. "You're the man, Alvah." 

Little Jack Diamond cleared 
his throat nervously. "What kind 
of a job did you have in mind, 
Mr. Manager? Of course, anything we can do for our city . . ." 

Wytak's big face, without perceptibly moving a muscle, somehow achieved a total change of 
expression. "Alvah, I want you to 
go to the Sticks." 

Gustad blinked and tilted upright in his chair. He looked at 
Diamond. 

The little man suddenly seemed two sizes smaller inside his 
box-cut cloth-of-silver tunic. He 
gestured feebly and wheezed, 
"Wake-me-up!" The porter behind his chair stepped forward 
alertly, clanking, and flipped open 
one of the dozens of metal and 
plastic boxes that clung to him 
all over like barnacles. He popped 
a tiny capsule into his palm, 
rolled it expertly to thumb-andfinger position, broke it under 
Diamond's nose. 

A reeking-sweet green fluid 
dripped from it and ran stickily 
down the front of Diamond's 
tunic. 

"Dumbhead!" said Diamond. 
"Not cream de menthy, a wake


me-up!" He sat up as the abashed 
servant produced another capsule. "Never mind." Some color 
was beginning to come back into 
his face. "Blotter!" A wad of 
absorbent fibers. "Vacuum!" A 
lemon-sized globe with a flaring 
snout. "Gon-Stink! Presser!" 

Gustad looked back at the 
Manager. "Your Honor, you 
mean you want me to go into 
the Sticks? I mean," he said, 
groping for words, "you want me 
to play for the Muckfeet?" 

"That is just exactly what I 
want you to do." Wytak nodded 
toward the Commissioner, the 
Director, and the Chairman. 
"These gentlemen are here to 
tell you why. Suppose you start, 
Ozzie." 

|~VSTERTAG, the one with the 
fringe of yellowish white hair 
around his potato-colored pate, 
shifted heavily and stared at 
Gustad. "In my bureau, we have 
records of population and population density, imports and exports, ratio of births to deaths 
and so on that go back all the 
way to the time of the United 
States. Now this isn't known generally, Mr. Gustad, but although 
New York has been steadily 
growing ever since its founding in 
1646, our growth in the last 
thirty years has been entirely due 
to immigration from other less 
fortunate citjes.

"In a way, it's fortunate — I 
mean to say that we can't expand horizontally, because it has 
been found impossible to eradicate the soil organisms — " a delicate shudder ran around the 
group — "left by our late enemies. 
And as for continuing to build 
vertically — well, since Pittsburgh 
fell, we have been dependent almost entirely on salvaged scrap 
for our steel. To put it bluntly, 
unless something is done about 
this situation, the end is in sight. 
Not alone of this administration, 
but of the city as well. Now the 
reasons for this — ah — what shall 
I say . . ." 

With his head back, staring at 
the ceiling, Wytak began to speak 
so quietly that Ostertag blundered through another phrase and 
a half before he realized he had 
been superseded as interlocutor. 

"Thirty years ago, when I first 
came to this town, an immigrant 
kid with nothing in the whole 
world but the tunic on my back 
and the gleam in my eye, we had 
just got through with the last of 
the Muckfeet Wars. According to 
your history books, we won that 
war. I'll tell you something — we 
were licked!" 

Alvah squirmed uncomfortably 
as Wytak raised his head and 
glanced defiantly around the 
desk, looking for contradiction: 
The Manager said, "We drove 
them back to the Ohio, thirty 



years ago. And where are they 
now?" He turned to Laurence. 
"Phil?" 

Laurence rubbed his long nose 
with a bloodless forefinger. "Their 
closest settlement is twelve miles 
away. That's to the southwest, of 
course. In the west and north — " 

"Twelve miles," said Wytak reflectively. "But that isn't the reason I say they licked us. They 
licked us because there are twenty 
million of us today . . . and about 
one hundred fifty million of them. 
Right, Phil?" 

Laurence said, "Well, there 
aren't any accurate figures, you 
know, Boley. There hasn't been 
any census of the Muckfeet for 
almost a century, but — " 

"About one hundred fifty million," interrupted Wytak. "Even 
if we formed a league with every 
other city on this continent, the 
odds would be heavily against 
us — and they breed like flies." 
He slapped the desk with his 
open palm. "So do their filthy 
animals!" 

A SHUDDER rippled across 
the group. Diamond shut his 
eyes tight. 

"There it is," said Wytak. 
"Rome fell. Babylon fell. The 
same thing can happen to New 
York. Those illiterate savages 
will go on increasing year by 
year, getting more ignorant and 
more degraded with every genera


10 




 



tion . . . and a century from now 
— or two, or five — they'll be the 
human race. And New York . . ." 

Wytak turned to" look at the 
map behind him. His hand touched a button and the myriad tiny 
lights went out. 

Gustad was not an actor who 
wept readily, but he felt tears 
welling over his eyelids. At the 
same time, the thought crossed 
his mind that, competition being 
what it was in the realies, it was 
a good thing that Wytak had 
gone into politics instead of acting. 

"Sir," he said, "what can we 
do?" 

Wytak's eyes were focused far 
away. After a moment, his head 
turned heavily on his massive 
shoulders, like a gun turret. 
"Chairman Neddo has the answer 
to that. I want you to listen 
carefully to what he's going to 
tell you, Alvah." 

Neddo's crowded small face 
flickered through a complicated 
series of twitches, all centripetal 
and rapidly executed. "Over the 
past several years," he said jerkily, "under Manager Wytak's direction, we have been developing 
certain devices, certain articles of 
commerce, which are designed, 
especially designed, to have an 
attraction for the Muckfeet. 
Trade articles. Most of these, I 
should say all of — " 

"Trade articles," Wytak cut 



in softly. "Thank you, Ned. 
That's the. phrase that tells the 
story. Alvah, we're going to go 
back to the principles that made 
our ancestors great. Trade — expanding markets — expanding industries. Think about it. From 
the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of 
Mexico, there are some 150 million people who haven't got a cigarette lighter or a wristphone or 
a realie set among them. Alvah, 
we're going to civilize the Muckfeet. We've put together a grabbag of modern science, expressed 
in ways their primitive minds 
can understand — and you're the 
man who's going to sell it to 
them! What do you say to that?" 

This was a familiar cue to Gustad — it had turned up for the 
fiftieth or sixtieth time in his last 
week's script, when he had played 
the role of a kill-crazy sewer inspector, trapped by flood waters 
in the cloacae of Under Brooklyn. "I say — " he began, then 
realized that his usual response 
was totally inappropriate. "It 
sounds wonderful," he finished 
weakly. 

W7YTAK nodded in a businesslike way. "Now here's 
the program." He pressed a button, and a relief map of the 
North American continent appeared on the wall behind him. 
"Indicator." Wytak's porter put 
a metal tube with a shaped grip 



NATURAL STATE 



11 



into his hand — a tiny spot on the 
map fluoresced where he pointed 
it. 

"You'll swing down to the 
southwest until you cross the 
Tennessee, then head westward 
about to here, then up through 
the Plains, then back north of 
the Great Lakes and home again. 
You'll notice that this route keeps 
you well clear of both Chicago 
and Toronto. Remember that — 
it's important. We know that 
Frisco is working on a project 
similar to ours, although they're 
at least a year behind us. If we 
know that, the chances are that 
'the other Cities know it too, but 
we're pretty sure there's been 
no leak in our own security. 
There isn't going to be any." 

He handed the indicator back. 
"You'll be gone about three 
months . . . 

Diamond was having trouble 
with his breathing again. 

". . . You'll have to' rough it 
pretty much — there'll be room in 
your floater for you and your 
equipment, and that's all." 

Diamond gurgled despairingly 
and rolled up his eyes. Gustad 
himself felt an unpleasant sinking 
sensation. 

"You mean," he asked incredulously, "I'm supposed to go all 
by myself — without even a porter?" 

"That's right," said Wytak. 
"You see, Alvah, you and I are 



civilized human beings — we know 
there are so many indispensable 
time and labor saving devices 
that nobody could possibly carry 
them all himself. But could you 
explain that to a Muckfoot?" 
"I guess not." 

"That's why only a man with 
your superb talents can do this 
job for the City. Those people 
actually live the kind of sordid 
brutal existence you portray so 
well in the realies. Well, you 
can be as rough and tough as 
they are — you can talk their own 
language, and they'll respect 
you." 

Gustad flexed his muscles 
slightly, feeling pleased but not 
altogether certain. Then a new 
and even more revolting aspect of 
this problem occurred to him. 
"Your Honor, suppose I got along 
too well with the Muckfeet? I 
mean suppose they invited me 
into one of their houses to — " he 
gagged slightly — "eat?" 

Wytak's face went stony. "I 
am surprised that you feel it 
necessary to bring that subject 
up. All that will be covered very 
thoroughly in the briefing you 
will get from Commissioner Laurence and Chairman Neddo and 
their staffs. And I want you to 
understand, Gustad, that no pressure of any kind is being exerted 
on you to take this assignment. 
This is a job for a willing, cooperative volunteer, not a draftee.

If you feel you're not the man 
for it, just say so now." 

Gustad apologized profusely. 
Wytak interrupted him, with 
the warmest and friendliest smile 
imaginable. "That's all right, son, 
I understand. I understand perfectly. Well, gentlemen, I think 
that's all." 

A S soon as they were alone, 
Diamond clutched Gustad's 
sleeve and pulled him over to 
the side of the corridor. "Listen 
to me, Al boy. We can still pull 
you out of this. I know a doctor 
that will make you so sick you 
couldn't walk across the street. 
He wouldn't do it for everybody, 
but he owes me a couple of — " 
"No, wait a minute. I don't — " 
"I know, I know," said Diamond impatiently. "You'll get 
your contract busted with Seven 
Boroughs and you'll lose a couple 
months, maybe more, and you'll 
have to start all over again with 
one of the little studios, but what 
of it? In a year or two, you'll 
be as good as — " 
"Now wait, Jack. In the first — " 
"Al, I'm not just thinking about 
my twenty per cent of you. I 
don't even care about that — it's 
just money. What I want, I want 
you should still be alive next 
year, you understand what I 
mean?" 

"Look," said Gustad, "you 
don't understand, Jack. I want to 



go. I mean I don't exactly want 
to, but — " He pointed down the 
corridor to the window that 
framed a vista of gigantic columns, fiercely brilliant below, 
fading to massive darkness above, 
with a million tiny floater-lights 
drifting like a river of Stardust 
down the avenue. "Just look at 
that. It took thousands of years 
to build! I mean if I can keep it 
going just by spending three 
months . . . 

"And besides," he added practically, "think of the publicity." 

II 

HPHE foothill country turned 
out to be picturesque but not 
very rewarding. Alvah had bypassed the ancient states of Pennsylvania and Maryland as directed, since the tribes nearest the 
city were understood to be still 
somewhat rancorous. By the end 
of his first day, he was beginning 
to regard this as a serious understatement. 

He had brought his floater 
down, with flags flying, loudspeakers blaring, colored lights 
flashing and streamers flapping 
gaily behind him, just outside an 
untidy collection of two-story 
beehive huts well south of the 
former Pennsylvania border. He 
had seen numerous vaguely human shapes from the air, but 
when he extruded his platform 



NATURAL STATE 



13 



and stepped out, every visible 
door was shut, the streets were 
empty, and there was no moving 
thing in sight, except for a group 
of singularly unpleasant -looking 
animals in a field to his right. 

After a few moments, Gustad 
shut off the loudspeakers and 
listened. He thought he heard a 
hum of voices from the nearest 
building. Suppressing a momentary qualm, he lowered himself 
on the platform stair and walked 
over to the building. It had a 
single high window, a crude oval 
in shape, closed by a discolored 
pane. 

Standing under this window, 
Alvah called, "Hello in there!" 

The muffled voices died away 
for a moment, then buzzed as 
busily as ever. 

"Come on out — I want to talk 
to you!" 

Same result. 

"You don't have to be afraid! 
I come in peace!" 

The voices died away again, 
and Alvah thought he saw a dim 
face momentarily through the 
pane. A single voice rose on an 
interrogative note. 

"Peace!" Alvah shouted. 

The window slid abruptly back 
into the wall and, as Alvah gaped 
upward, a deluge of slops descended on him, followed by a 
gale of coarse laughter. 

Alvah's immediate reaction, 
after the first dazed and gasping 



instant, was a hot-water-andsoap tropism, carrying with it an 
ardent desire to get out of his 
drenched clothes and throw them 
away. His second, as imperious 
as the first, had the pure flame of 
artistic inspiration — he wanted to 
see how many esthetically satisfying small pieces one explosive 
charge would make out of that 
excrescence-shaped building. 

Under no conditions, said the 
handbook he had been required 
to memorize, will you commit 
any act which might be interpfeted by the Muckieet as aggressive, nor will you make use 
of your weapons at any time, unless such use becomes necessary 
for the preservation of your own 
life. 

Alvah wavered, grew chilly and 
retired. Restored in body, but 
shaken in spirit, he headed south. 

Then there had been his encounter with the old man and the 
animal. Somewhere in the triangle of land between the Mississippi and the Big Black, at a 
point which was not on his itinerary at all, but had the overwhelming attraction of being 
more than a thousand air-miles 
from New York, he had set 
the floater down near another 
sprawling settlement. 

A S usual, all signs of activity 
in and around the village 
promptly disappeared. With new


14 




 



ly acquired caution, Alvah sat 
tight. Normal human curiosity, 
he reasoned, would drive the 
Muckfeet to him sooner or later 
— and even if that failed, there 
was his nuisance value. How long 
could you ignore a strange object, a few hundred yards from 
your home, that was shouting, 
waving flags, flashing colored 
lights and sending up puffs of 
pink-and-green smoke? 

Nothing happened for a little 
over an hour. Then, half dozing 
in his control chair, Alvah saw 
two figures coming toward him 
across the field. 

Alvah's ego, which had been 
taking a beating all day, began 
to expand. He stepped out onto 
the platform and waited. 

The two figures kept coming, 
taking their time. The tall one 
was a skinny loose-jointed oldster with a conical hat on the 
back of his head. The little one 
ambling along in front of him 
was some sort of four-footed 
animal. 

In effect, an audience of one — 
at any rate, it was Alvah's best 
showing so far. He mentally rehearsed his opening lines. There 
was no point, he thought, in 
bothering with the magic tricks or 
the comic monologue. He might 
as well go straight into the sales' 
talk. 

The odd pair was now much 
closer, and Gustad recognized the 



animal half of it. It was a socalled watchdog, one of the incredibly destructive beasts the 
Muckfeet trained to do their 
fighting for them. It had a slender, supple body, a long feline tail 
and a head that looked something like a terrier's and something like a housecat's. However, 
it was not half as large or as 
frightening in appearance as the 
pictures Alvah had seen. It must, 
he decided, be a pup. 

fipWO yards from the platform, 
the oldster came to a halt. 
The watchdog sat down beside 
him, tongue lolling wetly. Alvah 
turned off the loudspeakers and 
the color displays. 

"Friend," he began, "I'm here 
to show you things that will 
astound you, marvels that you 
wouldn't believe unless you saw 
them with your own — " 

"You a Yazoo?" 

Thrown off stride, Alvah gaped. 
"What was that, friend ?" V 

"Ah said — you a Yazoo?" 

"No," said Alvah, feeling reasonably positive. 

"Any kin to a Yazoo?" 

"I don't think so." 

"Git," said the old man. 

Unlikely as it seemed, a Yazoo 
was apparently a good thing to 
be. "Wait a second," said Alvah. 
"Did you say Yazoo? I didn't 
understand you there at first. Am 
I a Yazoo! Why, man, my whole 



NATURAL STATE 



15 



family on both sides has been — " 
what was the plural of Yazoo? 

"Ah'll count to two," said the 
old man. "One." 

"Now wait a minute," said Alvah, feeling his ears getting hot. 
The watchdog, he noticed, had 
hoisted its rump a fraction of an 
inch and was staring at him in a 
marked manner. He flexed his 
right forearm slightly and felt the 
reassuring pressure of the pistol 
in its pop-out holster. "What 
makes you Muckfeet think you 
can—" 

"Two," said the oldster, and 
the watchdog was a spreadeagled blur in midair, seven feet 
straight up from the ground. 

Instinct took over. Instinct had 
nothing to do with pistols or 
holsters, or with the probable size 
of a full-grown Muckfoot watchdog. It launched Alvah's body 
into a backward standing broad 
jump through the open floater 
door, and followed that with an 
economical underhand punch at 
the control button inside. 

The door slammed shut. It 
then bulged visibly inward and 
rang like a gong. Sprawled on 
the floor, Gustad stared at it incredulously. There were further 
sounds — a thunderous growling 
and a series of hackle-raising 
skrieks, as of hard metal being 
gouged by something even harder. The whole floater shook. 

Alvah made the control chair 



in one leap, slammed on the 
power switch and yanked at the 
steering bar.. At an altitude of 
about a hundred feet, he saw the 
dark shape of the watchdog leap 
clear and fall, twisting. 

A few seconds later, he put 
the bar into neutral and looked 
down. Man and watchdog were 
moving slowly back across the 
field toward the settlement. As 
far as Alvah could tell, the beast 
was not even limping. 

A LVAH'S orders were reasonably elastic, but he had already stretched- them badly in 
covering the southward leg of his 
route in one day. Still, there 
seemed to be nothing else to do. 
Either there was an area somewhere on the circuit where he 
could get the Muckfeet to listen 
to him, or there wasn't. If there 
was, it would make more sense 
to hop around until he found it, 
and then work outward to its 
limits, than to blunder straight 
along, collecting bruises and insults. 

And if there wasn't — and this 
did not bear thinking about — 
then the whole trip was a bust. 

Alvah switched on his communicator and tapped out the 
coded clicks that meant, "Proceeding on schedule" — which was 
a lie — "no results yet" — which 
was true. Then he headed north. 

Nightfall overtook him as he 



16 




 



was crossing the Ozark Plateau. 
He set the floater's controls to 
hover at a thousand feet, went 
to bed and slept badly until just 
before dawn. With a cup of kaffin 
in his hand, he watched this phenomenon in surprised disapproval: The scattered lights 
winking out below, the first colorless hint of radiance, which illuminated nothing, but simply 
made the Universe seem more 
senselessly vast and formless than 
before; finally, after an interminable progression of insignificant 
changes, the rinds of orange and 
scarlet, and the dim Sun bulging 
up at the rim of the turning 
Earth. 

It was lousy theater. 

How, Alvah asked himself, 
could any human being keep 
himself from dying of sheer irrelevance and boredom against a 
background like that? He was 
aware that billions had done so, 
but his general impression of history was that people who didn't 
have a city always got busy improving themselves until they 
could build one or take one away 
from somebody else. All but the 
Muckfeet . . . 

Once their interest has been 
engaged, said the handbook at 
one point, you will lay principal 
stress upon the competitive advantages of each product. It will 
be your aim to create a situation 
in which ownership of one or 



more of our products will be not 
only an economic advantage, but 
a mark of social distinction. In 
this way, communities which 
have accepted the innovations 
will, in order to preserve and extend the recognition of their own 
status, be forced to convert members of neighboring communities. 

Well, maybe so. 

Alvah ate a Spartan breakfast 
of protein jelly and citron cakes, 
called in the coordinates and the 
time to the frog- voiced operator 
in New York, and headed the 
floater northward again. 

The landscape unrolled itself. 
If there were any major differences between this country and 
the districts he had seen yesterday, Alvah was unable to discern them. In the air, he saw an 
occasional huge flapping shape, 
ridden by human figures. He 
avoided them, and they ignored 
him. Below, tracts of dark-green 
forest alternated predictably with 
the pale green, red or violet of 
cultivated fields. Here and there 
across the whole visible expanse, 
isolated buildings stood. At intervals, these huddled closer and 
closer together and became a 
settlement. There were perhaps 
more roads as he moved northward, dustier ones. That was all. 

■T^HE dustiness of these roads, it 
occurred to Alvah, was a matter that required investigation. 



NATURAL STATE 



17 



The day was cloudless and clear; 
there was no wind at Alvah's 
level, and nothing in the behavior 
of the trees or cultivated plants 
to suggest that there was any 
farther down. 

He slowed the floater and lowered it toward the nearest road. 
As he approached, the thread of 
ocher resolved itself into an irregular series of expanding puffs, 
each preceded by a black dot, 
the overall effect being that of a 
line of black-and-tan exclamation points. They seemed to be 
moving barely perceptibly, but 
were actually, Alvah guessed, 
traveling at a fairly respectable 
clip. 

He transferred his attention to 
another road. It, too, was filled 
with hurrying dots, as was the 
next — and all the traffic was 
heading in approximately the 
same direction, westward of Alvah's course. 

He swung the control bar over. 
The movement below, he was 
able to determine after twenty 
minutes' flying, converged upon 
a settlement .larger than any he 
had yet seen. It sprawled for ten 
miles or more along the southern 
shore of a long and exceedingly 
narrow lake. Most of it looked 
normal enough — a haphazard arrangement of cone-roofed buildings — but bn the side away from 
the lake, there was a fairly extensive area filled with what seemed 



to be long, narrow sheds. This, 
in turn, was bounded on two sides 
by a strip of fenced-in plots in 
which, as nearly as Alvah could 
make out through the dust, animals of all sizes and shapes were 
penned. It was this area which 
appeared to be the goal of every 
Muckfoot in the central Plains. 

The din was tremendous as Alvah floated down. There were 
shouts, cries, animal bellowings, 
sounds of hammering, occasional 
blurts of something that might 
be intended to be music, explosions of laughter. The newcomers, 
he noted, were being herded with 
much confusion to one or another 
of the fenced areas, where they 
left their mounts. Afterward, they 
straggled across to join the sluggish river of bodies in the avenues 
between the sheds. 

No one looked up or noticed 
the dim shadow of the floater. 
Everyone was preoccupied, shouting, elbowing, blowing an instrument, climbing a pole. Alvah 
found a clear space at some distance from the sheds — as far as 
he could conveniently get from 
the penned animals — and landed. 

He had no idea what this gathering was about. For all he knew, 
it might be a war council or 
some kind of religious observance, in which case his presence 
might be distinctly unwelcome. 
But in any case, there were customers here. 



18 




 



He looked dubiously at the 
stud that controlled his attentioncatchers. If he used them, he 
would only be following directives, but he had a strong feeling 
that it would be a faux pas to 
do so in this situation. At the 
other extreme, the obvious thing 
to do was to get out and go look 
for someone in authority. This 
would involve abandoning the 
protection of the floater, however, and he might blunder into 
some taboo place or ceremony. 

Evidently his proper course 
was to wait unobtrusively until 
he was discovered. On the other 
hand, if he stayed inside the 
floater with the door shut, the 
Muckfeet might take more alarm 
than if he showed himself. Still, 
wasn't it possible that they would 
be merely puzzled by a floater, 
whereas they would be angered 
by a floater with a man on its 
platform? Or, taking it from another angle . . . 

The hell with it. 

A LVAH ran the platform out, 
**■ opened the door and stepped 
out. He was relieved when, as he 
was considering the delicate 
problem of whether or not to 
lower the stair, a small group 
of men and urchins came into 
view around the corner of the 
nearest shed, a dozen yards away 
from him. 

They stopped when they saw 



him, and two or three of the 
smallest children scuttled behind 
their elders. They exchanged 
looks and a few words that Alvah couldn't hear. Then a pudgy 
little man with a fussed expression crowded forward, and the 
rest followed him at a discreet 
distance. 

"Hello," said Alvah tentatively
The little man came to a halt 
a yard or so from the platform. 
He had a white badge of some 
kind pinned to his shapeless 
brown jacket, and carried a sheaf 
of papers in his hand. "Who 
might you be?" he asked irritably. 

"Alvah Gustad is my name. I 
hope I'm not putting you people 
out, parking in your area like 
this, Mr.—" 

"Well, I should hope to spit 
you is, though. Supposed to be 
a tent go up right there. Got to 
be one by noon. What did you 
say your name was, Gus what?" 

"Gustad. I don't believe I 
caught your name, Mr. — " 

"Don't signify what my name 
is. We're talking about you. 
What clan you belong to?" 

"Uh — Flatbush," said Alvah at 
random. "Look, as long as I'm 
in the way here, you just tell me 
where to move to and — " 

"Some little backwoods clan, I 
never even heard of it," said the 
pudgy man. "I'll tell you where 



NATURAL STATE 



19 



you can move to. You can just 
haul that thing back where you 
come from. Gustad — Flatbush! 
You ain't on my list, I know 
that." 

The other Muckfeet had moved 
up gradually to surround the 
little man. One of them, a lanky 
sad-faced youngster, nudged him 
with his elbow. "Might just check 
and see, Jake." 

"Well, I ought to know. My 
land, Artie, I got my work to do. 
I can't spend all day standing 
here." 

Artie's long face grew more 
mournful. "You thought them 
Keokuks wasn't on the list, 
either." 

"Well— all right then, rot it." 
To Alvah: "What's your marks?" 

Alvah blinked. "I don't—" 

"Come down offa there." Jake 
turned impatiently to a man behind him. "Give'm a stake." As 
Alvah came hesitantly down the 
stair, he found he was being 
offered a sharpened length of 
wood by a seamy-faced brown 
man, who carried a bundle of 
others like it under his arm. 

Alvah took it, without the least 
idea of what to do next. The 
brown man watched him alertly. 
"You c'n make your marks with 
that," he volunteered and pointed to the ground between them. 

The others closed in a little. 

"Marks?" said Alvah worriedly. 



fTiHE brown man hesitated, 
then took another stake from 
his bundle. "Like these here," he 
said. "These is mine." He drew 
a shaky circle and put a dot in 
the center of it. "George." A 
figure four. "Allister — that's me." 
A long rectangle with a loop at 
each end. "Coffin — that's m' 
clan." 

Jake burst out, "Well, crying 
in a bucket, he knows that! You 
know how to sign your name, 
don't you?" 

"Well," said Alvah, "yes." He 
wrote Alvah Gustad and, as an 
afterthought, added Flatbush. 

There were surprised whistles. 
"Wrote it just as slick as Doc!" 
said a ten-year-old tow-headed 
male, bug-eyed with awe. 

Jake stared at Alvah, then 
spun half around to wave his 
papers under Artie's nose. "Well, 
you satisfied now, Artie Brumbacher? I guess that ain't on my 
list, is it?" 

"No," Artie admitted, "I guess 
it ain't — not if you can read the 
list, that is." 

Everybody but Alvah laughed, 
Jake louder than anyone. "All 
right," he said, turning back to 
Alvah, "you just hitch up your 
brutes and get that thing our of 
here. If you ain't gone by the 
time I—" 

"Jake!" called a businesslike 
female voice, and a small figure 
came shouldering through the 



20 




 



crowd. "They need you over in 
the salamander shed — the Quincies are ready to move in, but 
there's some Sullivans ahead of 
them." She glanced at Alvah, 
then at the floater behind him. 
"You having any trouble here?" 

"All settled now" Jake told 
her. "This feller ain't on the list. 
I ' just give him his marching 
orders." 

"Look, if I can say something — " Alvah began. 

The girl interrupted him. "Did 
you want to exhibit something at 
the Fair?" 

"That's right," said Alvah 
gratefully. "I was just trying to 
explain — " 

"Well, you're late, but maybe 
we can squeeze you in. You won't 
sell anything, though, if it's what 
I think it is. Let me see that list, 
Jake." 

"Now wait a minute," said 
Jake indignantly. "You know we 
ain't got room for nobody that 
ain't on the list. We got enough 
trouble—" 

"The Earth-movers won't be 
here from Butler till tomorrow," 
said the girl, examining the papers. "We can put him in there 
and move him out again when 
they get here. You need any 
equipment besides what you 
brought?" 

"No," said Alvah. "That would 
be fine, thanks. All I need is a 
place — " 



"All right. Before you go, Jake, 
did you tell those Sullivans they 
could have red, green and yellow 
in the salamander shed?" 

"Well, sure I did. That what it 
says right there." 

CHE handed him back the pa^ pers and pointed to a line. 
"That's Quincy, see? Dot instead 
of a cross. Sullivans are supposed 
to have that corner in the garden 
truck shed, keep the place warm 
for the seedlings, but they won't 
budge till you tell them it was a 
mistake. Babbishes and Stranahans are fit to be tied. You get 
over there and straighten them 
out, will you? And don't worry 
too much about him." 

Jake snorted and moved away, 
still looking ruffled. The girl 
turned to Alvah. "All right, let's 
go." 

Unhappy but game, Alvah 
turned and climbed back into 
the floater with the girl close behind him. The conditioning he'd 
had just before he left helped 
when he was in the open air, but 
in the tiny closed cabin of the 
floater the girl's triply compounded stench was overpowering. 

How did they live with themselves? 

She leaned over the control 
chair, pointing. "Over there," she 
said. "See that empty space I'm 
pointing at?"

Alvah saw it and put the floater there as fast as the generator 
would push it. The space was 
not quite empty — there were a 
few very oddly assorted Muckfeet and animals in it, but they 
straggled out when they saw him 
hovering, and he set the floater 
down. 

To his immense relief, the girl 
got out immediately. Alvah followed her as far as the platform. 

Ill 

IN a tailor shop back in Middle 
Queens, the proprietors, two 
brothers named Wynn, whose 
sole livelihood was the shop, 
stared glumly at the bedplate 
where the two-hundred-gallon 
Klenomatic ought to have been. 

"He say anything when he 
took it away?" Clyde asked. 

Morton shrugged and made a 
sour face. 

"Yeah," said Clyde. He looked 
distastefully at a dead cigar and 
tossed it at the nearest oubliette. 
He missed. 

"He said a month, two 
months," Morton told him. "You 
know what that means." 

"Yeah." 

"So I'll call up the factory," 
Morton said violently. "But I 
know what they're gonna tell me. 
Give us a deposit and we'll put 
you on a waiting list. Waiting 
list!" 



"Yeah," said Clyde. 

In a factory in Under Bronnix, 
the vice president in charge of 
sales shoved a thick folder of 
coded plastic slips under the nose 
of the vice president in charge 
of production. "Look at those 
orders," he said. 

"Uh-huh," said Production. 

"You know how far back they 
go? Three years. You know how 
much money this company's lost 
in unfilled orders? Over two million—" 

"I know. What do you expect? 
Every fabricator in this place is 
too old. We're holding them together with spit and string. Don't 
bother me, will you, Harry. I 
got my own — " 

"Listen," said Sales. "This 
can't go on much longer. It's up 
to us to tell the Old Man that 
he's got to try a bigger bribe on 
the Metals people. Mortgage the 
plant if we have to — it's the only 
thing to do." 

"We have more mortgages now 
than the plant is worth." 

Sales reddened. "Nick, this is 
serious. Last fall, it looked like 
we might squeeze through another year, but now . . . You 
know what's going to happen in 
another eight, ten months?" He 
snapped his fingers. "Right down 
the drain." 

Production blinked at him 
wearily. "Bribes are no good any 
more, Harry. You know that as

well as I do. They're out." 

"Well, then what are we going 
to do?" 

Production shook his head. "I

don't know." 

|~VVER in Metals Reclamation 
Four, in Under and Middle 
Jersey, the night shift was just 
beginning. In the blue-lit cavern 
of Ferrous, this involved two 
men, one bald and flabby, the 
other gray and gnarled. They 
exchanged a silent look, then each 
in turn put his face into the time 
clock's retinoscope mask. The 
clock, which had been emitting a 
shrill irritating sound, gurgled 
its satisfaction and shut up. 

"Well, that's it," said the gray 
one. "I'll be your work gang and 
you be mine, huh?" 

The flabby one spat. "Wonder 
what happened to Turk." 

"Who cares? I never liked 
him." 

"Just wondering. Yesterday 
he's here, today where is he? 
Labor pool, army — " he spat 
again, with care — "repair, maintenance . . . He was fifteen years 
in this department. I was just 
wondering." 

"Scooping sewage, probably. 
That's about his speed." The 
gray man shambled over to the 
control bench opposite and looked at the indicators. Then he 
lighted a cigarette. 



"Nothing in the hoppers?" the 
flabby one asked. 

"Nah. They ought to put Turk 
in the hoppers. He had metal in 
his goddam teeth. Actual metal!" 

"Turk wasn't old," the flabby 
one said reproachfully. "No more 
than sixty." 

"I never liked him." 

"First it was the kid — you 
know, Pimples. Then, lessee, the 
next one was that big guy, the 
realie actor — " 

"Gustad. The hell with him." 

"Yeah, Gustad. What I mean 
is, where do they go to? It's 
the same thing on my three-toseven shift, over in Yeasts. Guys 
I knew for ten, fifteen, twenty 
years on the same job. All of a 
sudden, they're gone and you 
never see them. Must be a hell 
of a thing, starting all over again 
somewhere else — guys like that — 
I mean you get set in your ways, 
kind of." 

His eyes were patient and bewildered in their watery pouches. 
"Guys like me — no kids, nobody 
that gives a damn about 'em. 
Kind of gives you the jumps to 
think about it. You know what 
I mean?" 

The gray one looked embarrassed, then irritated, then defiant. "Aah," he said, and produced 
a deck of cards from his kit — 
the grimy coating on the creaseless, frayless plastic as lovingly 
built and preserved as the patina

in a meerschaum. "Cut for deal. 
Come on! Let's play." 

"¥'11 have to know what you 
going to exhibit," the girl 
said. "For the Fair records." 

"Labor-saving devices," Alvah 
told her, "the latest and best 
products of human ingenuity, 
designed to—" 

"Machines," she said, writing. 
She added, looking up, "There's 
a fee for the use of the fairground 
space. Since you're only going to 
have it for a day, we'll call it 
twenty twains." 

Alvah hesitated. He had no 
idea what a twain might be — it 
had sounded like "twain." Evidently it was some sort of crude 
Muckfoot coinage. 

"Afraid I haven't got any of 
your money," he said, producing 
a handful of steels from his belt 
change-meter. "I don't suppose 
these would do?" 

The girl looked at him steadily. 
"Gold?" she said. "Precious 
stones, platinum, anything of 
that kind?" Alvah shook his head. 
"Sure?" Alvah shrugged despairingly. "Well," she said after a 
moment, "maybe something can 
be arranged. I'll let you talk to 
Doc about it, anyhow. He'll have 
to decide. Come on." 

"Just a minute," Alvah said, 
and ducked back into the floater. 
He found what he was looking 
for and trotted outside again. 



"What's that?" asked the girl, 
looking at the bulky kit at his 
waist. 

"Just a few things I like to 
have with me." 

"Mind showing me?" 

"Well — no." He opened the kit. 
"Cigarette lighter, flashlight, 
shaver, raincoat, heater, a few 
medicines over here, jujubes, 
food concentrates, things like 
that. Uh, I don't know why I 
put this in here — it's a distress 
signal for people who get lost 
in the subway." 

"You never can tell," said the 
girl, "when a thing like that will 
come in handy." 

"That's true. Uh, this thing 
that looks like two dumbbells 
and a corkscrew . . ." 

"Never mind," said the girl. 
"Come along." 

The first shed they passed was 
occupied by things that looked 
like turtles with glittery four-foot 
shells. In the nearest stall, a man 
was peeling off from one of the 
beasts successive thin layers of 
this shell-stuff, which turned out 
to be colorless and transparent. 
He passed them to a woman, who 
dipped them into a basin and 
then laid them on a board to dry. 
The ones at the far end of the 
row, Alvah noticed, had flattened 
into discs. 

The girl apparently misread 
his expression as curiosity. "Glass 
tortoise," she told him. "For win

dows and so on. The young ones 
have more hump to their shells — 
almost spherical to start with. 
Those are for bottles and bowls 
and things." 

Alvah blinked noncommittally. 

ripHEY passed a counter on 
which metal tools were displayed — knives, axes and the like. 
Similar objects, Alvah noted automatically, had only approximately similar outlines. There 
seemed to be no standardization 
at all. 

"These are local," the girl said. 
"The metal comes from Iron Pits, 
just a few miles south of here." 

In the next shed was a long 
row of upright rectangular 
frames, most of them empty. One 
near the end, however, was filled 
with some sort of insubstantial 
film or fabric. A tiny scarlet creature was crawling rapidly up and 
down this gossamer substance, 
working its way gradually from 
left to right. 

"Squareweb," the girl informed 
him. "This dress I'm wearing was 
made that way." 

Alvah verified his previous impression that the dress was 
opaque. Rather a pity, since it 
was also quite handsomely filled 
out. Not, he assured himself, that 
it made any difference — the girl 
was a Muckfoot, after all. 

Next came a large cleared 
space. In it were half a dozen 



animals that resembled nothing 
in nature or nightmare except 
each other. They were wide and 
squat and at least six feet high 
at the shoulder. They had vaguely reptilian heads, and their scaly 
hides were patterned in orange 
and blue, rust and vermilion, yellow and poppy-red. 

The oddest thing about them, 
barring the fact that each had 
three sets of legs, was the extraordinary series of protuberances 
that sprouted from their backs. 
First came an upright, slightly 
hollow shield sort of thing, set 
crossways. behind the first pair of 
shoulders. Behind that, something that looked preposterously 
like an armchair — it even had a 
bright-colored cushion — and then 
a double row of upright spines 
with a wide space between them. 

"Trucks," said the girl. 

Alvah cleared his throat. 
"Look, Miss—" 

"Betty Jane Hofmeyer. Call 
me B. J. Everybody does." 

"All right — uh — B. J. I wonder 
if you could explain something 
to me. What's wrong with metal? 
And plastic, and things like that. 
I mean why should you people 
want to go to so much trouble 
and — and mess, when there are 
easier ways to do things better?" 

"Each," she said, "to his own 
taste. We turn here." 

A few yards ahead, the Fair 
ended and the settlement proper 



NATURAL STATE 



25 




began with an unusually large 
building — large enough, Alvah 
estimated, to fill almost an entire 
wing of a third-class hotel in New 
York. Unlike the hovels he had 
seen farther south — which looked 
as if they had been excreted — it 
was built of some regular, 
smooth-surfaced material, seamless and fairly well shaped. 

Alvah was so engrossed in these 
and other considerations that it 
wasn't until the girl turned three 
steps inside the doorway, impatiently waiting, that he realized 
a minor crisis was at hand — he 
was being invited to enter a 
Muckfoot dwelling. 

"Well, come on," said B. J. 



T9EFUSE any offers of food, 
transportation, etc., said the 
handbook, firmly, but as diplomatically as possible. Employ 
whatever subterfuge the situation may suggest, such as, 
"Thank you, but my doctor has 
forbidden me to touch fur," or, 
"Pardon me, but I have a sore 
throat and am unable to eat." 

Alvah cleared his throat frantically. The situation did not 
suggest anything at all. Luckily, 
however, his stomach did. 

"Maybe I'd better not come 
in," he said. "I don't feel very 
well. Maybe if I just sit down 
here quietly — " 

"You can sit down inside," 



26 




 



said the girl briskly. "If there's 
anything wrong with you, Doc 
will look you over." 

"Well," Alvah asked desperately, "couldn't you bring him out 
here for a minute? I really don't 
think—" 

"Doc is a busy man. Are you 
coming or not?" 

Alvah hesitated. There were, 
he told himself, only two possibilities, after all: (a) he would 
somehow manage to keep his 
breakfast, and (b) he wouldn't. 

The nausea began as a faint, 
premonitory twinge when he 
stepped through the doorway. It 
increased steadily as he followed 
B. J. past cages rilled with things 
that chirruped, croaked, rumbled, 
rustled or simply stared at him. 
The girl didn't invite comment 
on any of them, for which Alvah 
was grateful. He was too busy 
concentrating on trying not to 
concentrate on his misery. . 

For the same reason, he did 
not notice at what precise point 
the cages gave way to long rows 
of potted green plants. Alvah was 
just beginning to wonder if he 
would live to see the end of them 
when, still following B. J., he 
turned a corner and came upon a 
cleared space with half a dozen 
people in it. 

One of them was the sad-faced 
youth, Artie. Another was a 
stocky man, all chest and paunch 
and no neck at all, who was talk


ing to Artie while the others 
stood and listened. B. J. stopped 
and waited quietly. Alvah, perforce, did the same. 

" — just a few seedlings and a 
couple of one-year-olds for now 
— we'll see how they go. If you 
have more room later on . . . 
What else was I going to tell 
you?" The stocky man rumpled^ 
his hair nervously. "Oh, look, 
Artie, I had a copy of the specifications for you, but the fool bird 
got into a fight with a mirror and 
broke his . . . Wait a second." 
He turned abruptly. "Hello, Beej. 
Come along to the library for a 
second, will you?" 

He turned again and strode off, 
with Artie, B. J. and Alvah in his 
wake. 

'T'HE room they entered was, 
from Alvah's point of view, 
the worst he had struck yet. It 
was a hundred feet long by fifty 
wide, and everywhere — perched 
on the walls and on multi-leveled 
racks that ran the length of the 
room, darting through the air in 
flutters of brilliance — were tiny 
raucous birds, feathered in every 
prismatic shade, green, electricblue, violet, screaming red. 

"Mark seven one-oh-three!" 
Bither shouted. The roomful of 
birds took it up in a hideous 
echoing chorus. An instant later, 
a sudden flapping sound turned 
itself into an explosion of color 



NATURAL STATE 



27 



and alighted on the stocky man's 
shoulder, preening its feathers 
with a blunt green beak. "Rrk," it 
said and then, quite clearly, 
"Mark seven one-oh-three." 

The stocky man made a perch 
of one forefinger and handed the 
thing across to Artie's shoulder. 
"I can't give you this one. It's 
the only copy I got. You'll have 
to listen to it and remember what 
you need." 

"I'll remember." Artie glanced 
at the bird on his shoulder and 
said, "Magnus utility tree." 

The stocky man looked around, 
saw B. J. "Now, Beej, is it important? Because — " 

"Magnus utility tree," the bird 
was saying. "Thrives in all soils, 
over ninety-one per cent resistant 
to most rusts, scales and other infestations. Edible from root to 
branch. Young shoots and leaves 
excellent for salads. Self-fertilizing. Sap can be drawn in second 
year for — " 

"Doc," said the girl clearly, 
"this is Alvah Gustad. From New 
York. Alvah, meet Doc Bither." 

" — golden orangoes in spring 
and early summer, Bither aperries in late summer and fall. Will 
crossbreed with — " 

"New York, huh?" said Bither. 
"You a long way from home, 
young — Excuse me. Artie?" 

" — series five to one hundred fifteen. Trunks guaranteed 
straight and rectilinear, two-by


four at end of second year, fourby-six at — " 

"I all set, Doc." 

" — mealie pods and winterberries — " 

"Fine, all right." He took B. 
J.'s arm. "Let's go someplace we 
can talk." 

^ — absorb fireproofing and 
stiffening solutions freely through 
roots . . ." 

TMTHER led the way into a 
small, crowded room. "Now," 
he said, peering intently at Alvah, 
"what's the problem?" 

B. J. explained briefly. Then 
they both stared at Alvah. Sweat 
was beaded coldly on his brow 
and his knees were tremblingrbut 
he seemed to have stabilized the 
nausea just below the critical 
point. The idea, he told himself, 
was to convince yourself that the 
whole building was a realie stage 
and .all the objects in it props. 
Wasn't there a lrne to that effect 
in one of the classics — The Manager of Copenhagen, or perhaps 
Have It Your Own Way? 

"What do you think?" Bither 
asked. 

"Might try him out." 

"Urn. Damn it, I wish we 
hadn't run out of birds. Can you 
take this down for me, Beej? 
I'll arrange for the Fair rental 
fee, Alvah, if you just answer a 
few questions." 

It sounded innocuous enough, 



28 




 



but Alvah felt a twinge of suspicion. "What kind of questions?" 

"Just personal questions, like 
how old, what you do for a living." 

"Twenty-six. I'm an actor." 
"Always been an actor?" 
"No." 

"What else you done?" 
"Labor." 

"What kind?" B. J. asked. 

"Worked with his hands, he 
means," Bither told her. "Parents 
laborers, too?" 

"Yes." 

B. J. and Bither exchanged 
glances. Alvah shifted uncomfortably. "If that's all . . ." 

"One or two more. I want you 
to tell me, near as you can, when 
was the first time you remember 
knowing that our clothes and our 
animals and us and all the things 
we make smelled bad?" 

It was too much. Alvah turned 
and lurched blindly out the door. 
He heard their voices behind him : 

"... minutes." 

"... alley door!" 

Then there were hands on him, 
steering him from behind as he 
stumbled forward at a half-run. 
They turned him right, then left 
and finally he was out in the cool 
air, not a moment too soon. 

When he straightened, wiping 
tears away, he was alone, but a 
moment later the girl appeared 
in the doorway. 

"That's all," she said distantly. 



"You can start your exhibition 
whenever you want." 

IV 

fXiHE magic tricks went over 
fairly well — at least nobody 
yawned. The comic monologue, 
however, was a flat failure, even 
though the piece had been expertly slanted for a rural audience and, by all the laws of psychostatics, should have rated at 
least half a dozen boffs. ("So the 
little boy came moseying back 
up the road, and his grandpa said 
to him, 'Why didn't you drive 
them hogs out of the corn like I 
told you?' And the little fellow 
piped up, 'Them ain't hogs — 
them's shoats!' ") 

Alvah launched hopefully into 
his sales talks and demonstrations. 

The all-purpose fireless lifetime cooker was received with 
blank stares. When Alvah fried 
up a savory batch of proteinpaste fritters and offered to hand 
them out, nobody responded but 
one small boy, and his mother 
hauled him down off the platform stair by the slack of his 
pants. 

Smiling doggedly, Alvah 
brought out the pocket-workshop 
power tools and accessories. This, 
it appeared, was more like it. An 
interested hum went up as he 
drilled three holes of various sizes 



NATURAL STATE

in a bar of duroplast, then sawed 
through it from end to end and 
finally cut a mortise in one piece, 
a tenon in the other, and fitted 
them together. A few more people drifted in. 

"And now, friends," said Alvah, "if you'll continue to give 
me your kind attention . . ." 

The next item was the little 
giant power-plant for the home, 
shop or office. Blank stares again. 
Alvah picked out one Muckfoot 
in the front row — a blear-eyed, 
open-mouthed fellow, with hair 
over his forehead and a basket 
under his arm, who seemed typical — and spoke directly to him. 
He outdid himself about the safety, economy, efficiency and unobtrusiveness of a little giant 
power-plant. He explained its 
operation in words a backward 
two-year-old could understand. 

"A little giant," he concluded, 
leaning over the platform rail to 
stare hypnotically into the Muckfoot's eyes, "is the power-plant 
for you!" 

The fellow blinked, slowly produced a dark-brown lump of 
something from his pocket, slowly put it into his inattentive 
mouth, and as slowly began to 
chew. 

Alvah breathed deeply and 
clutched the rail. "And now," he 
said, giving the clincher, "the 
marvel of the age — the superspeed runabout!" He pressed the 



button that popped open a segment of the floater's hull and 
lowered the gleaming little twowheeled car into view. 

"Now, friends," he said, "just 
to demonstrate the amazing qualities of this miracle of modern 
science — is there- any gentleman 
in the crowd who has an animal 
he fancies for speed?" 

"C'OR the first time, the Muck■■- feet reacted according to the 
charts. Shouts rocketed up: "Me, 
by damn!" "Me!" "Right here, 
mister!" "Yes, sir!" 

"Friends, friends!" said Alvah, 
spreading his hands. "There 
won't be time to accommodate 
you all. Choose one of you to 
represent the rest!" 

"Switty!" somebody yelped, 
and other voices took up the cry. 
A red-haired young man began 
working his way back out of the 
crowd, propelled by gleeful 
shouts and slaps on the back. 

Alvah took an indicator and 
began pointing out the salient 
features of the runabout. He had 
not got more than a quarter of 
the way through when the redhead reappeared, mounted astride 
an animal which, to Alvah's revolted gaze, looked to be part 
horse, part lynx, part camel and 
part pure horror. 

To the crowd, evidently, it was 
one of nature's finest efforts. Alvah swallowed bile and raised his 



30 




 



voice again. "Clear a space now, 
friends — all the way around!" 

It took time, but eventually 
self-appointed deputies began to 
get the crowd moving. Alvah descended, carrying two bright 
marker poles, and, followed by 
the inquisitive redhead, set one 
up at either side of the enclosure, 
a few yards short of the boundary. 

"This will be the course," he 




NATURAL STATE 



told Swifty. "Around these markers and the floater — that thing I 
was standing on. We'll do ten 
laps, starting and finishing here. 
Is that all right?" 

"All right with me," said the 
redhead, grinning more widely 
than before. 

There were self-appointed 
time-keepers and starters, too. 
When Alvah, in the runabout, 
and the redhead, on his monster, 
were satisfactorily lined up, one 
of them bellowed, "On y' marks 
— Git set . . ." and then cracked 
a short whip with a noise out of 
all proportion to its size. 

For a moment, Alvah thought 
Swifty and his horrid mount had 
simply disappeared. Then he 
spotted them, diminished by perspective, halfway down the 
course, and rapidly getting smaller. He slammed the power bar 
over and took off in pursuit. 

A ROUND the first turn, it was 
Swifty, with Alvah nowhere. 
In the stretch, Alvah was coming 
up fast on the outside. Around 
the far turn, he was two monster 
lengths behind and, in the stretch 
again, they were neck and neck. 
Alvah kept it that way for the 
next two laps and then gradually 
pulled ahead. The crowd became 
a multicolored streak, whirling 
past him. In the sixth lap, he 
passed Swifty again — in the 
eighth, again — in the tenth, still 

31 



again — and when he skidded to a 
halt beyond the finish post, fluttering its flags with the wind of 
his passage, poor old Swifty and 
his steaming beast were still lumbering halfway down the stretch. 

"Now, friends," said Alvah, triumphantly mounting the platform again, "in a moment, I'm 
going to tell you how you, yourselves, can own this wonderful 
runabout and many marvels more 
— but first, are there any questions you'd like to ask?" 

Swifty pushed forward, grinless, looking like a man smitten 
by lightning. "How many to a 
get?" he called. 

Alvah decided he must have 
misunderstood. "You can have 
any number you want," he said. 
"The price is so reasonable — but 
I'm going to come to that in a — " 

"I don't mean how many will 
you sell. How many to a get?" 
Alvah looked blank. "How many 
calves, or colts, or whatever, is 
what I want to know." 

There was a general murmur 
of agreement. This, it would 
seem, was what everybody wanted to know. 

Appalled, Alvah corrected the 
misapprehension as quickly and 
clearly as he could. 

"Mean to say," somebody called, "they don't breed?" 

"Certainly not. If one of them 
ever breaks down — and, friends, 
they're built to last — you get it 



repaired or buy another." 

"How much?" somebody in 
the crowd yelled. 

"Friends, I'm not here to take 
your money," Alvah said. "We 
just want — " 

"Then how we going to pay 
for your stuff?" 

"I'm coming to that. When two 
people want to trade, friends, 
there's usually a way. You want 
our products. We want metals — 
iron, aluminum, chromium — " 

"Suppose a man ain't got any 
metal?" 

"Well, sir, there are a lot of 
other things we can use besides 
metal. Natural fruits and vegetables, for instance." 

The slack-faced yokel in the 
first row, the one with the basket 
under his arm, roused himself for 
the first time. His mouth closed, 
then opened again. "What kind?" 

"Natural products, friend. You 
know, the kind your great-granddad ate. We use a lot every year 
for table delicacies, even — " 

The yokel came halfway up 
the platform stair. His gnarled 
fingers dipped into the basket 
and came up with a smooth redgold ovoid. He shoved it toward 
Alvah. "You mean," he said incredulously, "you wouldn' eat 
that?" 

ULPING, Alvah backed away 
a step. The Muckfoot came 
after him. "Raise 'em myself," 



32 




 



he said plaintively, holding out 
the red fruit. "I tell you, they're 
just the juiciest, goodest — Go 
ahead, try one." 

"I'm not hungry," Alvah said 
desperately. "I'm on a diet. Now 
if you'll just step down quietly, 
friend, till after the—" 

The Muckfoot stared at him, 
holding the fruit under Alvah's 
nose. "You mean you won't fry 
it?" 

"No," said Alvah, trying not 
to breathe. "Now go on back 
down there, friend— don't crowd 
me." 

"Well," said the Muckfoot, 
"then durn you!" And he shoved 
the disgusting thing squashily into Alvah's face. 

Alvah saw red. Blinking away 
a glutinous film of juice and pulp, 
he glimpsed the yokel's face, 
spread into a hideous grin. Waves 
of laughter beat about his ears. 
Retching, he brought up his right 
fist in an instinctive roundhouse 
swing that clapped the yokel's 
grin shut and toppled him over 
the platform rail, basket, flying 
fruit and all. 

The laughter rumbled away into expectant silence. Alvah fumbled in his kit for tissues, scrubbed a wad of them across his 
face and saw them come away 
daubed with streaky red. He 
hurled them convulsively into 
the crowd and, leaning over the 
rail, shouted thickly, "Lousy 

NATURAL STATE 



stinking filthy Muckfeet!" 

Muckfoot men in the front 
ranks turned and looked at each 
other solemnly. Then two of 
them marched up the platform 
stair and, behind them, another 
two. 

Still berserk, Alvah met the 
first couple with two violent kicks 
in the chest. This cleared the 
stair, but he turned to find three 
more candidates swarming over 
the rail. He swung at the nearest, 
who ducked. The next one seized 
Alvah's arm with both hands and 
toppled over backward. Alvah 
followed, head foremost, and 
landed with a jar that shook him 
to his toes. 

The next thing he knew, he was 
lying on the ground surrounded 
by upward of twenty thick seamless boots, choking on dust, and 
getting the daylights methodically kicked out of him. 

Alvah rolled over frantically, 
climbed the first leg that came 
to hand, got his back against the 
platform and, by flint of cracking 
skulls together, managed in two 
brisk minutes to clear a momentary space around him. Another 
dim figure lunged at him. Alvah 
clouted it under the ear, whirled 
and vaulted over the rail onto the 
platform. 

His gun popped out into his 
hand. 

For just a moment, he was 
standing alone, feeling the pistol 

33 



grip clenched hard in his dirtcaked palm and able to judge 
exactly how long he had before 
half a dozen Muckfeet would 
swarm up the stair and over the 
rail. The crowd's faces were sharp 
and clear. He saw Artie and Doc 
Bither and Jake, his mouth open 
to howl, and he saw the girl, B. J., 
in a curious posture — leaning forward, her right arm thrust out 
and down. She had just thrown 
something at him. 

A LVAH saw the gray-white 
blur wobbling toward him. 
He tried to dodge, but the thing 
struck his shoulder and exploded 
with a papery pop. For a bewildering instant, the air was full 
of dancing bright particles. Then 
they were gone. 

Alvah didn't have time to wonder about it. He thumbed the 
selector over to Explosive, pointed the gun straight up and 
squeezed the trigger. 

Nothing happened. 

There were two Muckfeet half 
over the rail and three more coming up the stair. Incredulous, still 
aiming at the air, Alvah tried 
again — and again. The gun didn't 
work. 

Three Muckfeet were on the 
platform, four more right behind 
them. Alvah spun through the 
open door and slapped at the 
control button. The door stayed 
open. 



The Muckfeet were massed in 
the doorway, staring in like visitors at an aquarium. Alvah dived 
at the power bar, shoved it over. 
The floater didn't lift. 

"Holly! Luke!" called a clear 
voice outside, and the Muckfeet 
turned. "Leave him alone. He's 
got enough troubles now." 

Alvah was pawing at the control board. 

The lights didn't work. 

The air - conditioner didn't 
work. 

The scent-organ didn't work. 

The musivox didn't work. 

One of the Muckfeet put his 
head in at the door. "Reckon he 
has," he said thoughtfully and 
went away again. Alvah heard 
his voice, more faintly. "You do 
something, B. J.?" 

"Yes," said the girl, "I did 
something." 

ll/|"OVING warily, Alvah went 
outside. The girl was standing just below the platform, 
watching as the Muckfoot men 
filed down the stair. 

"You!" he said to her. 

She paid him no attention. 
"Just one of those things, Luke," 
she said. 

Luke nodded solemnly. "Well, 
the Fair don't come but once a 
year." He and the other men 
moved past her into the crowd, 
each one acquiring a train of 
curiosity-seekers as he went. The 



34 




 



crowd began to drift away. 

A familiar voice yelped, 
"Ride'm out on a razorback is 
what / say!" 

A chorus of "Now, Jake!" went 
up. There were murmurs of dissent, of inquiry, of explanation. 
"Time for the poultry judging!" 
somebody called, and the crowd 
moved faster. 

Alvah went dazedly down and 
climbed into the runabout. He 
waggled its power bar. No response. 

He tore open his kit and began 
frantically hauling out one glittery object after another, holding 
each for an instant and then 
throwing it on the ground. The 
' razor, the heater, the vacuum 
cleaner, the sonotube, the vibromasseur. 

Swifty rode by, at ease atop 
his horse-lynx-camel-horror. He 
was whistling. 

The crowd was almost gone. 
Among the stragglers was Jake, 
fists on his pudgy hips, his choleric cheeks gleaming with sweat 
and satisfaction. 

"Well, Mister High-andMighty," he called, "what are 
you going to do now?" 

That was just what Alvah was 
wondering. He was about a thousand miles from home by air — 
probably more like fifteen hundred across-country. He had no 
transportation, no shelter, no 
power tools, no equipment. He 



had, he realized with horror, been 
cut off instantly from everything 
that made a man civilized. 
What was he going to do? 

V .. 

Tl/JANAGER Wytak had his 
feet on the glossy desktop. 
So did the Comptroller, narrowfaced old Mr. Creedy; the Director of Information, plump Mr. 
Kling; the Commissioner of Supply, blotched and pimpled Mr. 
Jackson; and the porcine Mr. 
McArdle, Commissioner of War. 
With chairs tilted back, they 
stared through a haze of cigar 
smoke at each others' stolid faces 
mirrored on the ceiling. 

Wytak's voice was as confident 
as ever, if a trifle muted, and 
when the others spoke, he listened. These were not the hired nonentities Alvah had seen; these 
were the men who had made 
Wytak, the electorate with whose 
consent he governed. 

"Jack," said Wytak, "I want 
you to look at it my way and 
see if you don't think I'm right. 
It isn't a question of how long 
we can hold out — when you get 
right down and look at it, it's a 
question of can we do anything." 

"In time," said Jackson expressionlessly. 

"In time. But if we can do 
anything, there'll be time enough. 
You say we've got troubles now 



NATURAL STATE 



35 



and you're right, but I tell you 
we can pull through a situation a 
thousand times worse than this — 
if we've got an answer. And have 
we got an answer? We have." 

Creedy grunted. "Like to see 
some results, Boley." 

"You'll see them. You can't 
skim a yeast tank the first day, 
Will." 

"You can see the bubbles, 
though," said Jackson sourly. 
"Any report from this Gustad 
today, while we're talking about 
it?" 

"Not yet. He was getting some 
response yesterday. He's following it up. I trust that boy — the 
analyzers picked his card out of 
five million. Wait and see. He'll 
deliver." 

"If you say so, Boley." 

"I say so." 

Jackson nodded. "That's good 
enough. Gentlemen?" 

TN another soundproof, spyproof office in Over Manhattan, Kling and McArdle met 
again twenty minutes later. 

"What do you think?" asked 
Kling with his meaningless smile. 

"Moderately good. I was hoping he would lie about Gustad's 
report, but of course there was 
very little chance of that. Wytak 
is an old hand." 

"You admire him?" Kling suggested. 

"As a specimen of his type. 



Wytak pulled us out of a very 
bad spot in '39." 
"Agreed." 

"And he has had his uses since 
then. There are times when brilliant improvisation is better than 
sound principles — and times 
when it is not. Wytak is an incurable romantic." 

"And you?" 

"We," said McArdle grimly, 
"are realists." 

"Oh, yes. But perhaps we are 
not anything just yet. Creedy is 
interested, but not convinced — 
and until he moves, Jackson will 
do nothing." 

"Wytak's project is a failure. 
You can't do business with the 
Muckfeet. But the fool was so 
confident that he didn't even interfere with Gustad's briefing." 

Kling leaned forward with interest. "You didn't . . .?" 

"No. It wasn't necessary. But 
it means that Gustad has no instructions to fake successful reports — and that means Wytak 
can't stall until he gets back. 
There was no report today. Suppose there's none tomorrow, or 
the next day, or the next." 

"In that case, of course . . . 
However, it's always as well to 
offer something positive. You said 
you might have something to 
show me today." 

"Yes. Follow me." 

In a sealed room at the end of 
a guarded corridor, five young 



36 




 



men were sitting. They leaped to 
attention when Kling and McArdle entered. 

"At ease," said McArdle. "This 
gentleman is going to ask you 
some questions. You may answer 
freely." He turned to Kling. "Go 
ahead — ask them anything." 

Kling's eyebrows went up delicately, but he looked the young 
men over, selected one and said, 
"Your name?" 

"Walter B. Limler, sir." 

Kling looked mildly pained. 
"Please don't call me sir. Where 
do you live?" 

"CFF Barracks, Tier Three, 
McCormick." 

"CFF?" said Kling with a 
frown. "McCormick? I don't 
place the district. Where is it?" 

The young man, who was 
blond and very earnest, allowed 
himself to show a slight surprise. 
"In the Loop," he said. 

"And where is the Loop?" 

The young man looked definitely startled. He glanced at 
McArdle, moistened his lips and 
said, "Well, right here, sir. In 
Chicago." 

Kling's eyebrows went up and 
then down. He smiled. "I begin 
to see," he murmured to McArdle. "Very clever." 

TT cost Alvah two hours' labor, 
using tools that had never 
been designed to be operated 
manually, to get the inspection 



plate off the motor housing in the 
floater. He compared the intricate mechanism with the diagrams and photographs in the 
maintenance handbook. He looked for dust and grime; he checked 
the moving parts for play; he 
probed for dislodged wiring plates 
and corrosion. He did everything 
the handbook suggested, even 
spun the flywheel and was positive he felt the floater lift a fraction of an inch beneath him. As 
far as he could tell, there was 
absolutely nothing wrong, unless 
the trouble was in the core of 
the motor itself — the force-field 
that rotated the axle that made 
everything go. 

The core casing had an "easily 
removable" segment, meaning to 
say that Alvah was able to get 
it off in three hours more. 

Inside, there was no resistance 
to his cautious finger. The spoolshaped hollow space was empty. 

Under Motor Force-field Inoperative the manual said simply: Remove and replace rhodopalladium nodules. 

Alvah looked. He found the 
tiny sockets where the nodules 
ought to be, one in the flanged 
axle-head, the other facing it at 
the opposite end of the chamber. 
The nodules were not there at 
all. 

Alvah went into the storage 
chamber. Ignoring the increasingly forceful protests of his emp


NATURAl STATE 



37 



ty stomach, he spent a furious 
twenty minutes locating the spare 
nodules. He stripped the seal off 
the box and lifted the lid with 
great care. 

There were the nodules. And 
there, appearing out of nowhere, 
was a whirling cloud of brightness that settled briefly in the 
box and then went back where it 
came from. And there the nodules 
were gone. 

Alva stared at the empty box. 
He poked his forefinger into the 
cushioned niches, one after the 
other. Then he set the box down 
with care, about-faced, walked 
outside to the platform and sat 
down on the top step with his 
chin on his fists. 

"You look peaked," said B. J.'s 
firm voice. 

Alvah looked up at her briefly. 
"Go away." 

"Had anything to eat today?" 
the girl asked. 

Alvah did not reply. 

"Don't sulk," she said. "You've 
got a problem. We feel responsible. Maybe there's something 
we can do to help." 

Alvah stood up slowly. He 
looked her over carefully, from 
top to bottom and back again. 
"There is one thing you could 
do for me," he said. "Smile." 

"Why?" she asked cagily. 

"I wanted to see your fangs." 
He turned wearily and went into 
the floater. 



TIE puttered around for a few 
minutes, then got cold rations out of the storage chamber 
and sat down in the control chair 
to eat them. But the place was 
odious to him with its gleaming, 
useless array of gadgetry, and 
he went outside again and sat 
down with his back to the hull 
near the doorway. The girl was 
still there, looking up at him. 

"Look," she said, "I'm sorry 
about this." 

The nutloaf went down his 
gullet in one solid lump and hit 
his stomach like a stone. "Please 
don't mention it," he said bitterly. "It was really nothing at 
all." 

"I had to do it. You might 
have killed somebody." 

Alvah tried another bite. Chewing the stuff, at any rate, gave 
him something to do. "What 
were those things?" he demanded. 

"Metallophage," she said. 
"They eat metals in the platinum 
family. Hard to get them that 
selective — we weren't exactly sure 
what would happen." 

Alvah put down the remnant 
of nutloaf slowly. "Who's 'we'? 
You and Bither?" 

"Mostly." 

"And you — you bred those 
things to eat rhodopalladium?" 
She nodded. 

"Then you must have some to 
feed them," said Alvah logically. 
He stood up and gripped the 



38 




 



railing. "Give it to me." 

She hesitated. "There might be 
some — " 

"Might be? There musr be!" 

"You don't understand. They 
don't actually eat the metal — not 
for nourishment, that is." 

"Then what do they do with 
it?" 

"They build nests," she told 
him. "But come on over to the 
lab and we'll see." 

At the laboratory door, they 
were still arguing. "For the last 
time," said Alvah, "I will not 
come in. I've just eaten half a 
nutcake and I haven't got food 
to waste. Get the stuff and bring 
it out." 

"For the last time," said B. J., 
"get it out of your head that what 
you want is all that counts. If 
you want me to look for the 
metal, you'll come in, and that's 
flat." 

They glared at each other. 
Well, he told himself resignedly, 
he hadn't wanted that nutloaf 
much in the first place. 

They followed the same route, 
past the things that chirruped, 
croaked, rumbled, rustled. The 
main thing, he recalled, was to 
keep your mind off it. 

"Tell me something," he said 
to her trim back. "If I hadn't 
got myself mixed up with that 
farmer and his market basket, 
do you still think I wouldn't have 
sold anything?" 



"That's right." 

"Well, why not? Why all this 
resistance to machinery? Is it 
a taboo of some kind?" 

SHE said nothing for a moment. 
"Is it because you're afraid 
the Cities will get a hold on you?" 
Alvah insisted. "Because that's 
foolish. Our interests are really 
the same as yours. We don't just 
want to sell you stuff — we want' 
to help you help yourselves. The 
more prosperous you get, the better for us." 

"It's not that," she said. 
"Well, what then? It's been 
bothering me. You've got all 
these raw materials, all this land. 
You wouldn't have to wait for 
us — you could have built your 
own factories, made your own 
machines. But you never have. 
I can't understand why." 

"It's not worth the trouble." 
He choked. "Anything is worth 
the trouble, if it helps you do the 
same work more efficiently, more 
intel— " 

"Wait a minute." She stopped 
a woman who was passing in the 
aisle between the cages. "Marge, 
where's Doc?" 

"Down in roundworms, I 
think." 

"Tell him I have to see him, 
will you? It's urgent. We'll wait 
in here." She led the way into a 
windowless room, as small and 
cluttered as any Alvah had seen. 



NATURAL STATE 



39 



"Now," she said. "We don't 
make a fuss about machines because most people simply haven't 
any need for them." 

"That's ridiculous," Alvah argued. "You may think — " 

"Be quiet and let me finish. 
We haven't got centralized industries or power installations. 
Why do you think the Cities have 
never beaten us in a war, as often 
as they've tried? Why do you 
think we've taken over the whole 
world, except for Wenty-two 
Cities? You've got to face this 
sooner or later — in every single 
respect, our plants and animals 
are more efficient than any machine you could build." 

Alvah inspected her closely. 
Her eyes were intent and brilliant. Her bosom indicated deep 
and steady breathing. To all appearance, she was perfectly serious. 

"Nuts," he replied with dignity. 

¥> ¥ shook her head impa•«! • tiently. "I know you've 
got a brain. Use it. What's the 
most expensive item that goes 
into a machine?" 

"Metal. We're a little short of 
it, to tell the truth." 

"Think again. What are all 
« your gadgets supposed to save?" 

"Well, labor." 

"Human labor. If metal is expensive, it's because it costs a lot 
of man-hours." 



"If you want to look at it that 
way — " 

"It's true, isn't it? Why is a 
complicated thing more expensive 
than a simple one? More manhours to make it. Why is a rare 
thing more expensive than a common one? More man-hours to 
find it. Why is a — " 

"All right, what's your point?" 

"Take your runabout. You saw 
that was the thing that interested 
people most, but I'll show you 
why you never could have sold 
one. How many man-hours went 
into manufacturing it?" 

Alvah shifted restlessly. "It 
isn't in production. It's a trade 
item." 

She sniffed. "Suppose it was 
in production. Make an honest 
guess. Figure in everything — 
amortization on the plant and 
equipment, materials, labor and 
so on. You can check your answer against wages and prices 
in your own money — you'll come 
pretty close." 

Alvah reflected. "Between seven-fifty and a thousand." 

"Compare that with Swifty's 
Morgan Gamma — the thing you 
raced against. Two man-hours — 
just two, and I'm being generous." 

"Interesting," said Alvah, "if 
true." He suppressed an uneasy 
belch. 

"Figure it out. An hour for the 
vet when he was foaled. Call it 



40 



GALAXY 



SCIENCE FICTION 



another hour for amortization on 
the stable where it happened, but 
that's too much. It isn't hard to 
grow a stable and they last a 
long time." 

Alvah, who had been holding 
his own as long as machines were 
the topic, wasn't sure he could 
keep it up — or, more correctly, 
down. "All right, two hours," he 
said. "The animals feed themselves and water themselves, no 
doubt." 

"They do, but that comes under upkeep. Our animals forage, 
most of them — all the big ones. 
The rest are cheap and easy to 
feed. Your machines have to be 
fueled. Our animals repair themselves, like any living organism, 
only better and faster. Your machines have to be repaired and 
serviced. More man-hours. Incidentally, if you and Swifty took 
a ten-hour trip, you in your runabout, him on his Morgan, you'd 
spend just ten hours steering. 
Swifty would spend maybe fifteen minutes all told. And now 
we come to the payoff — " 

"Some other time," said Alvah irritably. 

"This is important. When your 
runabout — " 

"I'd rather not talk about it 
any more," said Alvah, raising 
his voice. "Do you mind?" 

"When your runabout breaks 
down and can't be fixed," she 
said firmly, "you have to buy 



another. Swifty's mare drops 
twins every year. There. Think 
about it." 

'T'HE door opened and Bither 
came in, looking more disheveled than ever. "Hello, Beej, Alvah. Beej, I think we shoulda 
used annelid stock for this job. 
These F 3 batches no good at — 
you two arguing?" 

Alvah recovered himself with 
an effort. "Rhodopalladium," he 
said thickly. "I need about a 
gram. Have you got it?" 

"Not a scrap," said Bither 
cheerfully. "Except in the nests, 
of course." 

"I told him I didn't think so," 
B. J. said. 

Alvah closed his eyes for a 
second. "Where," he asked carefully, "are the nests?" 

"Wish I knew," Bither admitted. "It's frustrating as hell. You 
see, we had to make them awful 
small and quick, the metallophage. Once you let them out of 
the sacs, there's no holding them. 
We did so good a job, we can't 
check to see how good a job we 
did." He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Of course, that's beside 
the point. Even if we had the 
metals, how would you get the 
alloy you need?" 

"Palladium," said the girl, 
"melts at fifteen fifty-three Centigrade. I asked the hand bird." 

"Best we can get out of a sala

mander is about six hundred," 
Bither added. "Isn't good for 
them, either — they get esophagitis." 

"And necrosis," the girl said, 
watching Alvah intently. 

His eyes were watering. It was 
hard to see. "Are you telling — " 

"We're trying to tell you," she 
said, "that you can't go back. 
You've got to start getting used 
to the idea. There isn't a thing 
you can do except settle down 
here and learn to live with us." 

Alvah could feel his jaw working, but no words were coming 
out. The bulge of nausea in his 
middle was squeezing its way inexorably upward. 

Somebody grabbed his arm. 
"In there!" said Bither urgently. 

A door opened and closed behind him, and he found himself 
facing a hideous white-porcelain 
antique with a pool of water in 
it. There was a roaring in his 



ears, but before the first spasm 
took him, he could hear the girl's 
and Bither's voices faintly from 
the other room: 

"Eight minutes that time." 

"Beej, I don't know." 

"We can do it!" 

"Well, I suppose we can, but 
can we do it before he starves?" 

There was a sink in the room, 
but Alvah would sooner have 
drunk poison. He fumbled in his 
disordered kit until he found the 
condenser canteen. He rinsed out 
his mouth, took a tonus capsule 
and a mint lozenge. He opened 
the door. 

"Feeling better?" asked the 
girl. 

Alvah stared at her, retched 
feebly and fled back into the 
washroom. 

WHEN he came out again, 
Bither said, "He's had 
enough, Beej. Let's take him out

in the courtyard till he gets his 
strength back." , 

They moved toward him. Alvah said weakly, but with feeling, 
"Keep your itchy hands off me." 
He walked unsteadily past them, 
turned when he reached the doorway. "I hate to urp and run, but 
I'll never forget your hospitality. 
If there's ever anything I can do 
for you — anything at all — please 
hesitate to call on me." 

He heard muttering voices and 
an odd scraping sound behind 
him, but he didn't look back. He 
was halfway down the aisle between the cages when something 
furry and gray scuttled into view 
and sat up, grinning at him. 

It looked like an ordinary capuchin monkey except for its 
head, which was grotesquely 
large. "Go away," said Alvah. He 
advanced with threatening gestures. The thing chattered at him 
and stayed where it was. 



The aisle behind him was deserted. Very well, there were other 
exits. Alvah followed his nose 
back into the plant section and 
turned right. 

There was the monkey-thing 
again. 

At the next intersection of 
aisles, there were two of them. 
Alvah turned left. 

And right. 

And left. 

And emerged into a large empty space enclosed by buildings. 

"This is the courtyard," said 
Bither, coming forward with the 
girl behind him. "Now be reasonable, Alvah. You want to get 
back to New York, don't you?" 

This did not seem to call for 
comment. Alvah stared at him in 
silence. 

"Well," said Bither, "there's 
just one way you can do it. It 
won't be easy — I don't even say 
you got more than a fighting 





NATURAL STATE 



43 



chance. One thing, though — it's 
up to you just how hard you 
make it for yourself." 

"Get to the point," Alvah said. 

"You got to let us decondition 
you so you can eat our food, ride 
on our animals. Now think about 
it, don't just — " 

Alvah swung around, looking 
for the fastest and most direct 
exit. Before he had time to find 
it, a dizzying thought struck him 
and he turned back. 

"Is that what this whole thing 
has been about?" he challenged. 
He glared at Bither, then at B. J. 
"Is that the reason you were so 
helpful? Did you engineer that 
fight?" 

"OITHER clucked unhappily. 
" "Would we admit it if we 
did? Alvah, I'll admit this much 
— of course we interested in you 
for our own reasons. This is the 
first time in thirty years we had 
a chance to study a City man. 
But what I just told you is true. 
If you want to get back home, 
this is your only chance." 

"Then I'm a dead man," said 
Alvah. 

"You is if you think you is," 
Bither told him. "Beej, you try." 

She looked at Alvah levelly. 
"You think what we suggesting 
isn't possible. Right?" 

"Discounting Doc's grammar," 
Alvah said sourly, "that's exactly 
what I'm thinking." 



She said, "Doc's grammar is all 
right — yours is sixty years out 
of date. But I guess you already 
realize that your people are backward compared to us." 

Half angry, half curious, Alvah 
demanded, "Just how do you figure that?" 

"Easy. You probably don't 
know much biology, but you 
must know this much. What's 
the one quality that makes human beings the dominant race on 
this planet?" 

Alvah snorted. "Are you trying 
to tell me I'm not as bright as a 
Muckfoot?" 

"Not intelligence. Try again. 
Something more general — intelligence is only a special phase of 
it." 

Alvah's patience was narrowing to a thin and brittle thread. 
"You tell me." 

"All right. We like to think 
intelligence is important, but you 
can't argue that way. It's special 
pleading — the way a whale might 
argue that size is the measuring 
stick, or a microbe might say 
numbers. But — " 

"Control of environment," Alvah said. 

"Right. Another name for it is 
adaptability. No other organism 
is so independent of environment, 
so adaptable as Man. And we 
could live in New York if we 
had to, just as we can live in the 
Arctic Circle or the tropics. And, 



44 




 



since you don't dare even try to 
live here . . ." 

"All right," Alvah said bitterly. 
"When do we start?" 

VI 

TIE refused to be hypnotized. 

"You promised to help," 
B. J. said in annoyance. "We 
can't break the conditioning till 
we find out how it was done, you 
big oaf!" 

"The whole thing is ridiculous 
anyhow," Alvah pointed out. "I 
said I'd let you try and I will — 
you can prod me around to your 
heart's content — but not that. 
I've put in a lot of Required 
Contribution time in restricted 
laboratories. Military secrets. 
How do I know you wouldn't ask 
me about those if you got me 
under?" 

"We're not interested in — " 
B. J. began furiously, but Bither 
cut her off. 

"We is, though, Beej. Might be 
important for us to know what 
kind of defenses New Yorjc has 
built up, and I going to ask him 
if I got the chance." He sighed. 
"Well, there other ways to skin 
a glovebeast. Lean back and relax, Alvah." 

"No tricks?" Alvah asked suspiciously. 

"No, we just going to try to 
improve your conscious recall. 
Relax now; close your eyes. Now 



think of a room, one that's familiar to you, and describe it to me. 
Take your time . . . Now we going 
further back — further back. You 
three years old and you just dropped something on the floor. What 
is it?" 

Bither seemed to know what he 
was doing, Alvah had to admit. 
Day after day they dredged up 
bits and scraps of memory from 
his childhood, events he had forgotten so completely that he 
would almost have sworn they 
had never happened. At first, all 
of them seemed trivial and irrelevant, but even so, Alvah 
found, there was an unexpected 
fascination in this search through 
the dusty attics of his mind. Once 
they hit something that made 
Bither sit up sharply — a dark 
figure holding something furry, 
and an accompanying remembered stench. 

Whether or not it had been as 
important as Bither seemed to 
think, they never got it back 
again. But they did get other 
things — an obscene couplet about 
the Muckfeet that had been popular in P. S. 9073 when Alvah was 
ten; a scene from a realie feature 
called Nix on the Stix; a whispered horror story; a frightening 
stereo picture in a magazine. 

"What we have to do," B. J. 
told him at one point, "is to make 
you realize that none of this was 
your own idea. They made you

45 



feel this way. They did it to you." 

"Well, I know that," said Alvah. 

She stared at him in astonishment. "You knew it all along — 
and you don't care?" 

"No." Alvah felt puzzled and 
irritated. "Why should I?" 

"Don't you think they should 
have let you make up your own 
mind?" 

Alvah considered this. "You 
have to make your children see 
things the way you do, otherwise 
there wouldn't be any continuity 
from one generation to the next. 
You couldn't keep any kind of 
civilization going. Where would 
we be if we let people wander 
off into the Sticks and become 
Muckfeet?" 

TTE finished triumphantly, but 
she didn't react properly. She 
merely grinned with an exasperating air of satisfaction and said, 
"Why should they want to — unless we can give them a better 
life than the Cities can?" 

This was absurd, but Alvah 
couldn't find the one answer that 
would flatten her, no matter how 
long and often he mulled it over. 
Meanwhile, his tolerance of 
Muckfoot dwellings progressed 
from ten minutes to thirty, to an 
hour, to a full day. He didn't like 
it and nothing, he knew, could 
ever make him like it, but he 
could stand it. He was able to 



ride for short distances on Muckfoot animals, and he was even 
training himself to wear an animal-hide belt for longer and longer periods each day. But he still 
couldn't eat Muckfoot food — the 
bare thought of it still nauseated 
him — and his own supplies were 
running short. 

Oddly, he didn't feel as anxious 
about it as he should have. He 
could sense the resistance within 
him softening day by day. He 
was irrationally sure that that 
last obstacle would go, too, when 
the time came. Something else 
was bothering him, something he 
couldn't even name — but he 
dreamed of it at night and its 
symbol was the threatening vast 
arch of the sky. 

After the Fair was over, it 
seemed that B. J. had very little 
work to do. As far as Alvah could 
make out, the same was true of 
everybody. The settlement grew 
mortuary-still. For an hour or so 
every morning, lackadaisical 
trading went on in the central 
market place. In the evenings, 
sometimes, there was music of a 
sort and a species of complicated 
ungainly folk-dancing. The rest 
of the time, children raced 
through the streets and across the 
pastures, playing incomprehensible games. Their elders, when 
they were visible, sat — on doorsteps by ones and twos, grouped 
on porches and lawns — their 



46 




 



hands busy, oftener than not, 
with some trifle of carving or 
needlework, but their faces as 
blank and sleepy as a frog's in 
the Sun. 

"What do you do for excitement around here?" he asked B. 
J. in a dither of boredom. 

She looked at him oddly. "We 
work. We make things, or watch 
things grow. But maybe that's 
not the kind of excitement you 
mean." 

"It isn't, but let it go." 

"Our simple pleasures probably 
wouldn't interest you," she said 
reflectively. "They're pretty dull. 
We dance, go riding, swim in the 
lake . . ." 

So they swam. 

TT wasn't bad. It was unsettling 
to have no place to swim to — 
you had to head out from the 
shore, gauging your distance, and 
then turn around to go back — but 
the lake, to Alvah's considerable 
surprise, was clearer and bettertasting than any pool he'd ever 
been in. 

Lying on the grass afterward 
was a novel sensation, too. It was 
comfortable — no, it was nothing 
of the sort; the grass blades 
prickled and the ground was 
lumpy. Not comfortable, but — 
comforting. It was the weight, 
he thought lazily, the massive 
mother-weight of the whole Earth 
cradling you — the endless slow 



pendulum-swing you felt when 
you closed your eyes. 

He sat up, feeling cheerfully 
torpid. B. J. was lying on her 
back beside him, eyes shut, one 
arm flung back behind her head. 
It was a graceful pose. In a detached way, he admired it, first 
in general and then in particular 
— the fine texture of her skin, 
the firmness of her bosom under 
the halter that half -covered it, 
the delicate tint of her closed 
eyelids — the catalogue prolonged 
itself, and he realized that B. J., 
when you got a good look at her, 
was a uniquely lovely girl. He 
wondered, in passing, how he had 
missed noticing it before. 

She opened her eyes and looked at him. There was a groundswell of some sort and, without 
particular surprise, Alvah found 
himself leaning over and kissing 
her. 

"Beej," he said some time 
later, "when I go back to New 
York — I don't suppose you'd 
want to come with me? I mean 
— you're different from the 
others. You're educated, you can 
read; even your grammar is 
good." 

"I know you mean it as a compliment and I'm doing my best 
not to sound ungrateful or hurt 
your feelings, but . . ." She made 
a frustrated gesture. "Take the 
reading — that's a hobby of Doc's 
and I picked it up from him. It's 



NATURAL STATE 



47 



a primitive skill, Alvah, something like manuscript illuminating. We have better ways now. 
We don't need it any more. Then 
the grammar ■ — didn't it ever 
strike you that I might be using 
your kind just to make things 
easier for you?" 

She frowned. "I guess that was 
a mistake. As of now, I quit. No, 
listen a minute! The only difference between your grammar and 
ours is that yours is sixty years 
out of date. You still use 'I am, 
you are, he is' and all that archaic nonsense of tenses, case and 
gender. What for? If that's good, 
suppose we hunted up somebody 
who said 'I am, thou art, he is,' 
would his grammar be better 
than yours?" 

"Well—" said Alvah. 

"And about New York, I appreciate that. But the Cities are 
done for, Alvah. In ten years 
there won't be one left. They're 
finished." 

ALVAH stiffened. "That's the 
most ridiculous — " 
"Is it? Then why are you 
here?" 

"Well, we're in a crisis period 
now, but we've come through 
them before. You can't — " 

"This crisis of yours started a 
long while ago. J r i remember, it 
was around 1927 -flat Muller first 
changed the genes in fruit flies 
with X-ray bombardment. That 



was the first step — over a hundred years before you were even 
born. Then came colchicine and 
the electron microscope and microsurgery, all in the next thirty 
years. But the day biological engineering really grew up — 1962, 
Jenkins' and Scripture's gene 
charts and techniques — the Cities 
began to go. Little by little, people drifted out, to the land again, 
raising the new crops, growing 
the new animals. 

"The big Cities cannibalized 
the little ones, like an insect eating its own body when its food 
supply runs out. Now that's gone 
as far as it can, and you think it's 
just another crisis, but it isn't. 
It's the end." 

Alvah heard a chill echo of 
Wytak's words: "Rome fell. 
Babylon fell. The same thing can 
happen to New York . . ." 

He said, "What am I supposed 
to be, the rat that leaves the 
sinking ship?" 

She sighed. "Alvah, you got a 
better brain than that. 

"You don't have to think in 
metaphors or slogans, like a moron. I'm not asking you to join 
the winning side. That doesn't 
matter. In a few years there won't 
be but one side, no matter which 
way you jump." 

"What do you Want then?" he 
asked. 

She looked dispirited. "Nothing, I guess. Let's go home." 



48 




 



TT was a series of little things 
after that. There was the time 
he and Beej, out walking in the 
cool of the morning, stopped to 
rest at an isolated house that 
turned out to be occupied by 
George Allister of the Coffin clan, 
the shy little man who'd tried to 
show Alvah how to make his 
marks the day he landed. 

George, Alvah believed — and 
questioning of Beej afterward 
confirmed it — was about as low 
on the social scale as a Muckfoot 
could get. But he was his own 
master. He had a wife and three 
children and neat fields, with his 
own animals grazing in them. 
His house was big and cool and 
clean. He poured them lemonade 
— which Alvah wistfully had to 
decline — from a sweating peacock-blue pitcher, while sitting 
at his ease on the broad front 
porch. 

There were no servants among 
the Muckfeet. Alvah remembered an ancient fear of his, something that had cropped up in the 
old days every time he got seriously interested in a girl — that his 
children, if any, might relapse 
into the labor-pool category from 
which he had risen or — it was 
hard to say which would be worse* 
^-into the servants' estate. 

He went back fiom that outing 
very silent and thoughtful. 

There was the time, a few days 
later, when Beej was working, 



and Alvah, at loose ends, wandered into a room in the laboratory 
building where two of Bither's 
assistants, girls he knew by sight, 
were sitting with two large, leathery-woody, pod-shaped boxes 
open on the bench between them. 

Being hungry for company and 
preoccupied with himself at the 
same time, he didn't notice what 
should have been obvious, that 
the girls were busy at something 
private and personal. Even when 
they closed the boxes between 
them, he wasn't warned. "What's 
this?" he said cheerfully. "Can I 
see?" 

They glanced at each other 
uncertainly. "These is our bride 
boxes," said the brunette. "We 
don't usual show them to singletons — " 

They exchanged another 
glance. 

"He's spoke for anyhow," said 
the redhead, with an enigmatic 
look at Alvah. 

They opened the boxes. Inside 
each was a multitude of tiny compartments, each with a bit of 
something wrapped in cloth or 
paper tissue. The brunette chose 
one of the largest and unwrapped 
it with exaggerated care — an 
amorphous reddish-brown lump. 

"Houseplant," she said, and 
wrapped it up again. 

The redhead showed him a 
vial full of minuscule white 
spheres. "Weaver eggs. Two hun

49 



dred of them. That's a lot, but I 
like more curtains and things 
than most." 

"Wait a minute," said Alvah, 
perplexed. "What does a houseplant do?" 

"Grow a house, of course," the 
brunette said. She held up another vial full of eggs. "Scavengers." 

The redhead had a translucent 
sac with dark specks in it. "Utility trees." 

"Garbage converter." 

"This grows into a bed and 
these is chairbushes." 

And so on, interminably, while 
the girls' eyes glittered and their 
cheeks flushed with enthusiasm. 

'T'HE boxes, Alvah gathered, 
contained the germs of everything that would be needed to 
set up a Muckfoot household — 
beginning with the house itself. 
A thought struck him: "Does 
Beej have one of these outfits?" 

Wide-eyed stares from both 
girls. "Well, of course!" 

Alvah shifted uncomfortably. 
"Funny, she never mentioned it." 

The girls exchanged another of 
those enigmatic glances and said 
nothing. Alvah, for some reason, 
grew more uncomfortable still. 
He tried once more. "What about 
the man — doesn't he have to put 
up anything?" 

Yes, the man was expected to 
supply all the brutes and the 
seeds for outbuildings and all the 



crops except the bride's kitchengarden. Everything in and around 
the home was her province, everything outside was his. 

"Oh," said Alvah. 

"But if a young fellow don't 
have all that through no fault 
of his own, his clan put up for 
him and let him pay back when 
he able." 

"Ah," said Alvah and turned 
to make his escape. 

The redhead called after him, 
"You thought any about what 
clan you like to get adopted into, 
Alvah?" 

"Uh, no," said Alvah. "I don't 
think—" 

"You talk to Doc Bither. He a 
elder of the Steins. Mighty good 
clan!" 

Alvah bolted. 

Then there was the Shakespeare business. It began in his 
third week in the Sticks, when he 
was already carrying a fleshy 
Muckfoot vegetable around with 
him — a radnip, B. J. called it. 
He hadn't had the nerve yet to 
bite into it, but he knew the time 
was coming when he would. Beej 
came to him and said, "Alvah, 
the Rinaldos' drama group is 
doing Hamlet next Saturday, and 
they're short a Polonius. Do you 
think you could study it up by 
then?" 

"What's Hamlet? And who's 
Polonius?" 

She got the bird out of the li


50 




 



brary for him and he listened 
to the play, which turned out to 
be an archaic version of The 
Manager of Copenhagen. The 
text was nothing like the modernized abridgment he was used to, 
or the Muckfeet's slovenly speech 
either. It was full of words like 
down-gyved and unkennel. It was 
three-quarters incomprehensible 
until he began to get the hang 
of it, but it had a curious power. 
For who would bear the whips 
and scorns of time, the oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, the pangs of despised 
love, and so on and so on. It 
rumbled, but it rumbled well. 

pOLONIUS, however, was the 
*■ character Alvah knew as Paul 
Arnson, an inconsequential old 
man who only existed in the play 
to foul up the love affair between 
the principals and got killed in 
the third act. Alvah ventured to 
suggest that he might be of more 
use as Hamlet, but the director, 
a dry little man with a surprising 
boom to his voice, stubbornly insisted that all he needed was a 
Polonius — and seemed to intimate, without actually saying so, 
that Alvah was a dim prospect 
even for that. 

Alvah, with blood in his eye, 
accepted the part. 

The rehearsals were a nightmare. The lines themselves gave 
him no trouble — Alvah was a 



quick study; in the realies, you 
had to be — and neither, at first, 
did the rustic crudity of the stage 
he was asked to perform on. Letter-perfect when the other actors 
were still stuttering and blowing 
their lines, he walked through the 
part with quiet competence and 
put the director's sour looks down 
to a witless hayseed hostility — 
until, three days before the performance, he suddenly awoke to 
the realization that everyone else 
in the cast was acting rings 
around him. 

This wasn't the realies. There 
were no microphones to amplify 
his voice, no cameras to record 
every change in his expression. 
And the audience, what there was 
of it, was going to be right — out 
— there. 

Alvah went to pieces. Trying 
to emulate the others' wide gestures and declamatory delivery 
only threw him further off his 
stride. He had never had stagefright in his life, but by curtain 
time on Saturday night, he was 
a pale and quivering wreck. 

Dead and dragged off the stage 
at the end of act three, he got 
listlessly back into his own 
clothes and headed for an inconspicuous exit, but the director 
waylaid him. "Gustad," he said 
abruptly, "you ever thought of 
yourself as a professional actor?" 

"I had some such idea at one 
time," Alvah said. "Why?" 



NATURAL STATE 



51 



"Well, I don't see why you 
shouldn't. If you work at it. I 
never see a man pick up so fast." 

"What?" cried Alvah, thunderstruck. 

"You wasn't bad," said the director. "A few rough edges, but 
a good performance. Now I happen to know some people in a 
few repertory companies — the 
Mondrillo Troupe, the Kalfoglou 
Repertory, one or two more. If 
you interested, I'll bird them and 
see if there's an opening. Don't 
thank me, don't thank me." He 
moved off a few steps, then turned. "Oh, and, Gustad — get back 
into your costume, will you?" 

"Uh," said Alvah. "But I'm 
dead. I mean — " 

"For the curtain calls," said the 
director. "You don't want to miss 
those." He waved and walked 
back into the wings. 

Alvah absently drew out his 
radnip and crunched off a bite 
of it. The taste was faintly unpleasant, like that of old protein 
paste or the wrong variety of 
culture -cheese, but he chewec? 
and swallowed 'it. 

ri^HAT was when he realized 
that he had to get out. He 
didn't put on his costume again. 
Instead, he rummaged through 
the property boxes until he found 
an old pair of moleskiri trousers 
and a stained squareweb shirt. 
He put them on, left by the rear 



door and headed south. 

South for two reasons. First, 
because, he hoped, no one would 
look for him in that direction. 
Second, because he remembered 
what Beej had said that first day 
when they passed the display of 
tools: "The metal comes from 
Iron Pits, just a few miles south 
of here." 

There might be some slender 
chance still that he could get the 
metal he needed, delouse the 
floater and go home in style — 
without the painful necessity of 
explaining to Wytak what had 
happened to the floater and all 
his goods and equipment. If not, 
he would simply keep on walking. 

He had to do it now. He had 
almost waited too long as it was. 

They had laid out the pattern 
of a life for him — to marry Beej, 
settle down in a house that would 
grow from a seed Beej kept in a 
pod-shaped box, be a rustic repertory actor, raise little Muckfeet. And the devil of it was, 
some unreasonable part of him 
wanted all of that! 

A good thing he hadn't stayed 
for the curtain calls . . . 

The Sun declined as he went, 
until he was walking down a 
ghost-dim road under the stars, 
with all the cool cricket-shrill 
world to himself. 

He spent the night uncomfortably huddled under a hedge. 
Birds woke him with a great 



52 




 



clamor in the tree-tops shortly 
after dawn. He washed himself 
and drank from a stream that 
crossed the fields, ate a purplishred fruit he found growing nearby, then moved on. 

Two hours later, he topped a 
ridge and found his way barred 
by a miles-long shallow depression in the Earth. Like the rest 
of the visible landscape, it was 
filled with an orderly checkerwork of growing plants. 

There was nothing for it but 
to go through if he could. But 
surely he had gone more than "a 
few miles" by now? 

The road slanted down the 
embankment to a gate in a high 
thorn hedge. Behind the gate was 
a kind of miniature domed kiosk 
and, in the kiosk, a sunburned 
man was dozing with a greenand-purple bird on his shoulder. 

Alvah inspected a signboard 
that was entangled somehow in 
the hedge next to the gate. He 
was familiar enough by now with 
the Muckfeet's picture-writing to 
be fairly sure of what it said. 
The first symbol was a nail with 
an ax-head attached to it. That 
was iron. The second was a few 
stylized things that resembled 
fruit seeds. Pits? 

TTE stared through the gate in 
mounting perplexity. You 
might call a place like this "Pits," 
all right, but imagination boggled 



at calling it a mine. Still . . . 

The kiosk, he noticed now, 
bore a scrawled symbol in orange 
pigment. He recognized that one,' 
too; it was one of the common 
name-signs. 

"Jerry!" he called. * 

"Rrk," remarked the bird on 
the sleeping man's shoulder. 
"Kerry brogue; but the degradation of speech that occurs in 
London, Glasgow — " 

"Oh, damn!" said Alvah. "You, 
there. Jerry!" 

"Rrk. Kerry brogue; but the — " 

"Jerry!" 

"Kerry brogue!" shrieked the 
bird. The sunburned man sat up 
with a start and seized it by the 
beak, choking it off in the middle 
of "degradation." 

"Oh, hello," he said. "Don't 
know what it is about a Shaw 
bird, but they all alike. Can't 
shut them up." 

"I'd like," said Alvah, "to look 
through the — uh — Pits. Would 
that be all right?" 

"Sure," the man said cheerfully. He opened the gate and 
led the way down a long avenue 
between foot-high rows of plants. 

"I Jerry Finch," he said. 
"Littleton clan. Don't believe you 
said your name." 

"Harris," Alvah supplied at 
random. "I visiting from up 
north." 

"Yukes?" the man inquired. 

Alvah nodded, hoping for the 



NATURAL STATE 



53 



best, and pointed at the plants 
they were passing. "What these?" 

"Hinge blanks. Let them to 
forage last month. Won't have 
another crop here till August, and 
a poor one then. I tell Angus — 
he's the Pit boss — I tell him this 
soil's wore out, but he a pincher 
— squeeze the last ton out and 
then go after the pounds and 
ounces. You should seen what 
come off the ringbushes in the 
east hundred this April. Pitiful. 
Had to sell them for eyelets." 

A cold feeling was running up 
Alvah's spine. He cleared his 
throat. "Got any knife blades?" 
he inquired with careful casualness. 

"Mean bowies? Well, sure — 
right over yonder." 

ALVAH followed him to the 
end of the field and down 
three steps into the next. The 
plants here were much taller and 
darker, with stems thick and 
gnarled out of all proportion to 
their height. Here and there 
among the glossy leaves were incongruous glints of silvery steel. 

Alvah stooped and peered into 
the foliage. 

The silvery glints were perfectly formed six-inch chromesteel knife blades. Each was 
attached to — growing from — the 
plant by way of a hard brown 
stem, exactly the right size and 
shape to serve as a handle. 



He straightened carefully. "We 
do things a little different up 
north. You mind explaining briefly how the Pits works?" 

Jerry looked surprised, but began readily enough. "These like 
any other ferropositors. They extract the metal from the ores and 
deposit it in the bowie shape, or 
whatever it might be. Work from 
the outside in, of course, so you 
don't have no wood core to weaken it. We get a year's crops, average, before the ore used up. Then 
we bring the Earth-movers in, 
deepen the Pit a few feet, reseed 
and start over. Ain't much more 
to it." 

Alvah stared at the fantastic 
growths. Well, why not? Plants 
that grew into knives or doorknobs or . . . 

"What about alloys?" he asked. 

"We got iron, lead and zinc. 
Carbon from the air. Other metals we got to import in granules. 
Like we get chrome from the 
Northwest Federation, mostly. 
They getting too big for their 
britches, though. Greedy. I think 
we going to switch over to you 
Yukes before long. Not that you 
fellows is any better, if you ask 
me, but at least — " 

"Rhodium," said Alvah. "Palladium. What about them?" 

"How that?" 

"Platinum group." 

"Oh, sure, I know what you 
mean. We never use them. No call 



54 




 



to. We could get you some, I 
guess — I think the Northwests 
got them. Take a few months, 
though." 

"Suppose you wanted to make 
something out of a rhodopalladium alloy. How long would it 
take after you got the metals?" 

"Well, you have to make a 
bush that would take and put 
them together, right proportions, 
right size, right shape. Depends. 
I guess if you was in a hurry — " 

"Never mind," said Alvah 
wearily. "Thanks for the information." He turned and started 
back toward the gate. 

When he was halfway there, he 
heard a hullabaloo break out 
somewhere behind him. 

"Waw!" the voices seemed to 
be shouting. "Waw! Waw!" 

TTE turned. A dozen paces behind him, Jerry and the bird 
on his shoulder were in identical 
neck-straining attitudes. Beyond 
them, on the near side of a group 
of low buildings three hundred 
yards away, three men were waving their arms madly and shoutting, "Waw! Waw!" 

"Wawnt to know what it is," 
the bird squawked. "I wawnt be 
a Mahn. Violet: you come along 
with me, to your own — " 

"Shut up," said Jerry, then 
cupped his hands and yelled, 
"Angus, what is it?" 

"Chicagos," the answer drifted 

NATURAL STATE 



back. "Just got word! They dusting Red Pits! Come on!" 

Jerry darted a glance over his 
shoulder. "Come on!" he repeated 
and broke into a loping run toward the buildings. 

Alvah hesitated an instant, then 
followed. With strenuous effort, 
he managed to catch up to the 
other man. "Where are we running to?" he panted. "Red Pits?" 

"Don't talk foolish," Jerry 
gasped. "We running to shelter." 
He glanced back the way they 
had come. "Red Pits over that 
way." 

Alvah risked a look and then 
another. The first time, he wasn't 
sure. The second time, the dusting of tiny particles over the 
horizon had grown to a cluster 
of visibly swelling black dots. 

Other running figures were converging on the buildings as Angus 
and Jerry approached. The dots 
were capsule shapes, perceptibly 
elongated, the size of a fingernail, a thumbnail, a thumb . . . 

And under them on the land 
was a hurtling streak of goldendun haze, like dust stirred by a 
huge invisible finger. 

Rounding the corner of the 
nearest building, Jerry popped 
through an open doorway. Alvah 
followed — 

And was promptly seized from 
either side, long enough for something heavy and hard to hit him 
savagely on the nape of the neck.

VII 

"OITHER was intent over a 
shallow vessel half full of a 
viscous clear liquid, with a great 
rounded veined - and - patterned 
glistening lump immersed in it, 
transparent in the phosphor-light 
that glowed from the sides of the 




container — a single living cell in 
mitosis, so grossly enlarged that 
every gene of every paired chromosome was visible. B. J. watched from the other side of the 
table, silent, breathing carefully, 
as the man's thick fingers dipped 
a hair -thin probe with minuscule 
precision, again and again, into 
the yeasty mass, exercising a particle, splitting another, delicately 
shaving a third. 

From time to time, she glanced 
at a sheet of horn intricately inscribed with numbers and genetic 
symbols. The chart was there for 
her benefit, not for Bither's — he 
never paused or faltered. 



Finally, he sat back and covered the pan. "Turn on the lights 
and put that in the reduction 
fluid, will you, Beej? I bushed." 

She whistled a clear note, and 
the dark globes fixed to the ceiling glowed to blue-white life? 
"You going to grow it right 
away?" * 

"Have to, I guess. Dammit, 
Beej, I hate making weapons." 

"Not our choice. When you 
think it be?" 

He shrugged. "War meeting 
this afternoon over at Council 
Flats. They let us know when it 
be." 

She was silent until she had 
transferred the living lump from 
one container to another and put 
it away. Then, "Hear anything 
more?" 

"They dusting every ore-bed 
from here to the Illinois, look like. 
Crystal, Butler's—" 

"Butler's! That worked out." 

"I know it. We let them land 
there. They find out." After another pause, Bither said, "No 
word about Alvah, Beej. I sorry." 

She nodded. "Wouldn't be, this 
early." 

He looked at her curiously. 
"You still think he be back?" 

"If the dust ain't got him. Lay 
you odds." 

"Well," said Bither, lifting the 
cover of another pan to peer into 
it, "I hope you — " 

"Ozark Lake nine-one-two

five," said a reedy voice from 
the corner. "Ozark Lake nine — " 

"Get that, will you, Beej?" 

B. J. picked up the ocher spheroid from its shelf and said into 
its tympanum, "Bither Laboratories." 

"This Angus Littleton at Iron 
Pits," the thing said. "Let me 
talk to Bither." 

She passed it over, holding a 
loop of its rubbery cord — the beginning of a miles-long sheathed 
bundle of cultivated neurons that 
linked it, via a "switchboard" 
organism, with thousands like it 
in this area alone, and with millions more across the continent. 

"This Doc Bither. What is it, 
Angus?" 

"Something funny for you, 
Doc. We got a couple prisoners 
here, one a floater pilot, other a 
Chicago spy." 

"Well, what you want me to—" 

"Wait, can't you? This spy 
claim he know you, Doc. Say his 
name Custard. Alvah Custard." 

A LVAH stared out through the 
window, puzzled and angry. 
He had been in the room for 
about half an hour, while things 
were going on outside. He had 
tried to break the window. The 
pane had bent slightly. It was 
neither glass nor plastic, and it 
wasn't breakable. 

Outside, the last of the invading floaters was dipping down to


ward the horizon, pursued by a 
small darting black shape. Golden-dun haze obscured all the 
foreground except the first few 
rows of plants, which were drooping on their stems. The squadron 
had made one grand circle of the 
mine area, dusting as they went, 
before the Muckfeet on their 




incredibly swift flyers — birds or 
reptiles, Alvah couldn't tell which 
— had risen to engage them. Since 
then, a light breeze from the 
north had carried the stuff dropped over the Pits: radioactive 
dust with a gravitostatic charge 
to make it rebound and spread — 
and then, with its polarity reversed, cling like grim death where it 
fell. 

He turned and looked at the 
other man, sitting blank-faced 
and inattentive, wearing rumpled 
sky-blue uniform, on the bench 
against the inner wall. Most of 
the squadron had flown off to the 
west after that first pass, and had

57 



either escaped or been forced 
down somewhere beyond the Pits. 
This fellow had crash-landed in 
the fields not five hundred yards 
from Alvah's window. Alvah had 
seen the Muckfeet walking out to 
the wreck — strolling fantastically 
through the deadly haze — and 
turkey - trotting their prisoner 
back again. A little later, someone 
had opened the door and shoved 
the man in, and there he had sat 
ever since. 

His skin-color was all right. 
He was breathing evenly and 
seemed in no discomfort. As far 
as Alvah could see, there was not 
a speck of the death -dust anywhere on his skin, hair or clothing. But mad as it was, this was 
not the most incongruous thing 
about him. 

His uniform was of a cut and 
pattern that Alvah had seen only 
in pictures. There was a C on 
each gleaming button and, on 
the bar of the epaulette, CHIcagoland. In short, he was evidently a Floater Force officer 
from Chicago. The only trouble 
was that Alvah recognized him. 
He was a grips by day at the 
Seven Boroughs studios, famous 
for his dirty jokes, which he acquired at his night job in the 
Under Queens Power Station. He 
was a lieutenant j.g. in the N. Y. 
F. F. Reserve, and his name was 
Joe "Dimples" Mundry. 

Alvah went over and sat down 



beside him again. Mundry's normally jovial face was set in wooden lines. His eyes focused on 
Alvah, but without recognition. 
"Joe—" 

"My name," said Mundry obstinately, "is Bertram Palmer, 
Float Lieutenant, Windy City 
Regulars. My serial number is 
79016935." 

T^HAT was the only tune he 
■■■ knew. Alvah hadn't been able 
to get another word out of him. 
Name, rank and serial number — 
that was normal. Members of 
the armed services were naturally conditioned to say nothing 
else if captured. But why throw 
in the name of his outfit? 

One, that was the way they did 
things in Chicago, and there just 
happened to be a Chicago soldier 
who looked and talked exactly 
like Joe Mundry, who had the 
same scars on his knuckles from 
brawls with the generator monkeys. Two, Alvah's mind had snapped. Three, this was a ringer 
foisted on Alvah for some incomprehensible purpose by the 
Muckfeet. And four — a wild and 
terrible suspicion . . . 

Alvah tried again. "Listen, Joe, 
I'm your friend. We're on the 
same side. I'm not a Muckfoot." 

"My name is Bertram Palmer, 
Float Lieutenant — " 

"Joe, I'm leveling with you. 
Listen — remember the Music 



58 




 



Hall story, the one about the 
man who could . . ." Alvah explained in detail what the man 
could do. It was obscenely improbable and very funny, if you 
liked that sort of thing, and it 
was a story Joe had told him two 
days before he left New York. 

A gleam of intelligence came 
into Joe's eyes. "What's the 
punchline?" he demanded. 

" 'What the hell did you want 
to change the key on me for?' " 
Alvah replied promptly. 

Joe looked at him speculatively. "That might be a old joke. 
Maybe they even know it in the 
Sticks. And my name isn't Joe." 

He really believed he was Bertram Palmer of the Windy City 
Regulars, that much seemed 
clear. Also, if it was possible that 
the Muckfeet knew that story, it 
was likelier still that the Chicagolanders knew it. 

"All right," said Alvah, "ask 
me a question — something I 
couldn't know if I were a Muckfoot. Go ahead, anything. A place, 
or something that happened recently, or whatever you want." 

A visible struggle was going on 
behind Joe's face. "Can't think 
of anything," he said at last. 
"Funny." 

Alvah had been watching him 
closely. "Let's try this. Did you 
see Manhattan Morons?" 

Joe looked blank. "What?" 

"The realie. You mean you 



missed it? Manhattan Morons? 
Till I saw that, I never really 
knew what a comical bunch of 
weak-minded, slobber-mouthed, 
monkey - faced drooling idiots 
those New Yorkers — " 

Joe's expression had not changed, but a dull red flush had crept 
up over his collar. He made an 
inarticulate sound and lunged for 
Alvah's throat. 

When Angus Littleton opened 
the door, with Jerry and B. J. 
behind him, the two men were 
rolling on the floor. 

"TVTHAT made you think he 

" was a spy?" B. J. demanded. They were a tight self-conscious group in the corridor. 
Alvah was nursing a split lip. 

"Said he a Yuke," Jerry offered, "but didn't seem too sure, so 
I said the Yukes greedy. He never 
turn a hair. And he act like he 
never see a mine before. Things 
like that." 

B. J. nodded. "It was a natural 
mistake, I guess. Well, thanks for 
calling us, Angus." 

"Easy," said Angus, looking 
glum. "We ain't out of the rough 
yet, Beej." 

"What do you mean? He didn't 
have anything to do with this 
attack — he's from New York." 

"He say he is, but how you 
know? What make you think he 
ain't from Chicago?" 

Alvah said, "While you're ask


NATURAL STATE 



59 



ing that, you might ask another 
question about him." He jerked a 
thumb toward the closed door. 
"What makes you think he is?" 

The other three stared at him 
thoughtfully. "Alvah," Beej began, "what are you aiming at? 
Do you think — " 

"I'm not sure," Alvah interrupted. "I mean I'm sure, but I'm 
not sure I want to tell you. 
Look," he said, turning to Angus, 
"let me talk to her alone for a 
few minutes, will you?" 

Angus hesitated, then walked 
away down the hall, followed by 
Jerry. 

"You've got to explain some 
things to me about this raid," 
said Alvah when they were out 
of hearing. "I saw those floaters 
dusting and it was the real thing. 
I can tell by the way the plants 
withered. But your people were 
walking around out there. Him, 
too — the prisoner. How come?" 

"Antirads," said the girl. 
"Little para-insects, like the metallophage — the metallophage was 
developed from them. When 
you've been exposed, the antirads 
pick the dust particles off you 
and . deposit them in radproof 
pots. They die in the pots, too, 
and We bury the whole — " 

"All right," Alvah said. "How 
long have you had those things? 
Is there any chance the Cities 
knew about it?" 

"The antirads were developed 



toward the end of the last City 
war. That was what ended it. At 
first we stopped the bombing, 
and then when they used dust — 
You never heard of any of this?" 

"No," Alvah told her. "Third 
question, what are you going to 
do about Chicago now, on account of this raid?" 

"T)ULL it down around their 
•■- ears," B. J. said gravely. 
"We never did before partly 
because it wasn't necessary. We 
knew for the last thirty years 
that the Cities could never be 
more than a nuisance to us again. 
But this isn't just a raid. They've 
attacked us all over this district 
— ruined the crops in every mine. 
We must put an end to it now — 
not that it makes much difference, this year or ten years from 
now. And it isn't as if we couldn't 
save the people . . ." 

"Never mind that," said Alvah 
abstractedly. Then her last words 
penetrated. "No, go ahead — 
what?" 

"I started to say, we think we'll 
be able to save the people, or 
most of them — partly thanks to 
what we learned from you. It's 
just Chicago we're going to destroy, not the — " 

"Learned from me?" Alvah repeated. "What do you mean?" 

"We learned that, when it's a 
question of survival, a City man 
can overcome his conditioning. 



60 




 



You proved that. Did you eat the 
radnip?" 
"Yes." 

"There, you see? And you'll eat 
another and, sooner or later, 
you'll realize they taste good. A 
human being can learn to like 
anything that's needful to him. 
We're adaptable — you can't condition that out of us without 
breaking us." 

Alvah stared at her. "But you 
spent over two weeks on me. How 
are you going to do that with 
fifteen or twenty million people 
all at once?" 

"We can do it. You were the 
pilot model — two weeks for you. 
But now that we know how, we're 
pretty sure we can do it in three 
days — the important part, getting 
them to eat the food. And it's a 
good thing the storehouses are 
full, all over this continent." 

They looked at each other silently for a moment. "But the 
Cities have to go," B. J. said. 

"Fourth and last question," he 
said. "If a City knew about your 
radiation defenses all along, what 
would be their reason for attacking you this way?" 

"Our first idea was that it was 
just plain desperation — they had 
to do something and there wasn't 
anything they could do that 
would work, so they just did 
something that wouldn't. Or 
maybe they hoped they'd be able 
to hold the mines long enough to 



get some metal out, even though 
they knew it was foolish to hope." 

"That was your first idea. 
What was your second?" 

She hesitated. "You remember 
what I told you, that the Cities 
cannibalized each other for a 
while, the big ones draining population away from the little ones 
and reclaiming their metals — and 
you remember I said that had 
gone as far as it could?" 

"Yes." 

"Well, when the big fish have 
eaten up all the little fish, they 
can eat each other till there's 
just one big fish left." 

"And?" asked Alvah tensely. 

"And maybe one City might 
think that, if they got us to make 
war on another, they could step 
in when the fighting was over and 
get all the metals they'd need to 
keep them going for years. So 
they might send raiding parties 
out in the other City's uniforms, 
and condition them to think they 
really were from that City. Was 
that what happened, Alvah?" 

ALVAH nodded reluctantly. 
"I don't understand it. They 
must have started planning this 
as soon as I stopped communicating. It doesn't make sense. 
They couldn't be that desperate 
— or maybe they could. Anyway, 
it's a dirty stunt. It isn't like 
New York." 

She said nothing — too polite 



NATURAL STATE 



61 



to contradict him, Alvah supposed. 

Down at the end of the hall, 
Angus was beginning to look impatient. Alvah said, "So now 
you'll pull New York down?" 

"Alvah, it may sound funny, 
b.ut I think you know this, really 
— you're doing your people a 
favor." 

"If that's so," he said wryly, 
"then New York was 'really' trying to do one for Chicago." 

"I was hoping you'd see that 
it doesn't matter. It might have 
been Chicago that went first, or 
Denver, or any of the others, 
but that isn't important — they 
all have to go. What's important 
is the people. This may be another thing that's hard for you to 
accept, but they're going to be 
happier, most of them." 

And maybe she was right, Alvah thought, if you counted in 
everybody, labor pool, porters 
and all. Why shouldn't you count 
them, he asked himself defiantly 
— they were people, weren't they? 
Maybe the index of civilization 
was not only how much you had, 
but how hard you had to work 
for it — incessantly, like the New 
Yorkers, holding down two or 
three jobs at once, because the 
City's demands were endless — 
or, like the Muckfeet, judiciously 
and with honest pleasure. 

"Alvah?" said the girl. She put 
her question no more explicitly 



than that, but he knew what she 
meant. 

"Yes, Beej," replied Alvah 
Gustad, Muckfoot. 

VIII 

|"VN the Jersey flats, hidden by 
a forest of traveler trees, a 
sprawling settlement took form 
— mile after mile of forcedgrowth dwellings, stables, administration buildings, instruction 
centers. It was one of five. There 
was another farther north in Jersey, two in the Poconos and one 
in the vestigial state of Connecticut. 

They lay empty, waiting, their 
roofs sprouting foliage that perfectly counterfeited the surrounding forests. Roads had been 
cleared, converging toward the 
City, ending just short of the 
half-mile strip of wasteland that 
girdled New York, and it was 
there that Alvah stood. 

He found it strange to feel 
himself ready to walk unprotected across that stretch of country, 
knowing it to be acrawl with tiny 
organisms that had been developed not to tolerate Man's artificial buildings, whether of stone, 
metal, cement or plastics, but 
crumbled them all to the ground. 
Stranger still to be able to visualize the crawling organisms without horror or disgust. 

But the strangest of all was 



62 




 



to be looking at the City from 
this viewpoint. The towers stared 
back at him across the surrounding wall, tall and shining and 
proud, the proudest human creation — a century ago. Pitifully 
outdated today, the gleaming 
Cities fought back, unaware that 
they had lost long ago, that their 
bright spires and elaborate gadgets were as antiquated as polished armor would have been against 
a dun-painted motorized army. 

"I wish I could go with you," 
said Beej from the breathing forest at his back. 

"You can't," Alvah said without turning. "They wouldn't let 
you through the gate alive. They 
know me, but even so, I'm not 
sure they'll let me in after all 
this time. Have to wait and see." 

"You know you don't have to 
go. I mean — " 

"I know what you mean," said 
Alvah unhappily, "and you're 
right. But all the same, I do have 
to go. Look, Beej, you've got that 
map I drew. It's a ten-to-one 
chance that, if I don't make the 
grade, they'll put me in the quarantine cells right inside the wall. 
So you're not to worry. Okay?" 

"Okay," she promised, worried. 

He kissed her and watched her 
fade back into the forest where 
the others were — Bither and Artie 
Brumbacher and a few others 
from home, the rest Jerseys and 
other clansmen from the Sea


board Federation — cheerful, matter-of-fact people who were 
going to bear most of the burdens of what was coming, and 
never tired of reminding the inlanders of the fact. 

He turned and walked out 
across the wasteland, crunching 
the dry weeds under his feet. 

npHERE was a naming moat 
around the City and, beyond 
the moat, high in the wall, a 
closed gateway — corroded tight, 
probably ; it was a very long time 
since the City had had any traffic 
except by air. But there was a 
spy tower above the gate. Alvah 
walked up directly opposite its 
bulbous idiot eyes, waved, and 
then waited. 

After a long time, an inconspicuous port in the tower squealed 
open and a fist-sized dark ovoid 
darted out across the flames. It 
came to rest in midair, two yards 
from Alvah, clicked and said 
crisply, "State your name and 
business." 

"Alvah Gustad. I just got back 
from a confidential mission for 
the City Manager. Floater broke 
down, communicator, everything. 
I had to walk back. Tell him I'm 
here." 

The ovoid hovered exactly 
where it was, as if pinned against 
the air. Alvah waited. When he 
got tired of standing, he dropped 
his improvised knapsack on the 



NATURAL STATE 



63 



ground and sat on it. Finally the 
ovoid said harshly, in another 
voice, "Who are you and what 
do you want?" 

Alvah patiently gave the same 
answer. 

"What do you mean, broke 
down?" 

"Broke down," said Alvah. 
"Wouldn't run any more." 

Silence. He settled himself for 
another long wait, but it was only 
five minutes or thereabouts before 
the ovoid said, "Strip." 

When he had done so, the gate 
opposite broke open with a 
scream of tortured metal and 
ground itself back into a recess 
in the wall. The drawbridge, a 
long rust-pitted tongue of metal, 
thrust out and down to span the 
moat, a wall of flame on either 
side of it. 

Alvah walked across nimbly, 
the metal already hot against his 
naked soles, and the drawbridge 
whipped back into its socket. The 
gate screamed shut. 

ITHE room was the same, the 
■■■ anthems were the same. Alvah, disinfected, shaved all over 
and clad in an airtight glassine 
overall with its own air supply, 
stopped short two paces inside 
the door. The man behind the 
Manager's desk was not Wytak. 
It was jowly, red-faced Ellery 
„ McArdle, Commissioner of the 
Department of War. 



One of the guards prodded Alvah and he kept going up to the 
desk. "Now I think I get it," 
he said, staring at McArdle. 
"When—" 

McArdle's cold gaze flickered. 
Then his heavy head dropped 
forward a trifle, and he said, 
"Finish what you were saying, 
Gustad." 

"I was about to remark," Alvah 
said, "that when Wytak's pet 
project flopped, he lost enough 
support to let you impeach him. 
Is that right?" 

McArdle nodded and seemed 
to lose interest. "Your feet are 
not swollen or blistered, Gustad. 
You didn't walk back from the 
Plains. How did you get here?" 

Alvah took a deep breath. "We 
flew— on a passenger roc — as far 
as the Adirondacks. We didn't 
want to alarm you by too much 
air traffic so near the City, so 
we joined a freight caravan 
there." 

McArdle's stony face did not 
alter, but all the meaning went 
suddenly out of it. It was as if 
the man himself had stepped 
back and shut a door. The porter 
behind his chair swayed and 
looked as if he were about to 
faint. Alvah heard one of the 
guards draw in his breath sharply. • 

"Fthuh!" said McArdle abruptly, his face contorting. "Let's get 
this over. What do you know 



64 




 



about the military plans of the 
Muckfeet? Answer me fully. If 
I'm not satisfied that you do, 
I'll have you worked over till I 
am satisfied." 

Alvah, who had been feeling 
something like St. George and 
something like a plucked chicken, discovered that anger could 
be a very comforting thing. 
"That's what I came here to do," 
he said tightly. "The Muckfeets' 
military plans are about what 
you might have expected, after 
that lousy trick of yours. They 
know it wasn't Chicago that raided them." 

McArdle started and made as 
if to rise. Then he sank back, 
staring fixedly at Alvah. 

"They've had a gutful. They're 
going to finish New York." 

"When?" said McArdle, biting 
the word off short. 

"That depends on you. If 
you're willing to be reasonable, 
they'll wait long enough for you 
to dicker with them. Otherwise, 
if I'm not back in about an 
hour, the fun starts." 

lt/|cARDLE touched a stud, 
IT J. "Green alert " pressed the 
stud again and laced his fingers 
together on the desk. "Hurry it 
up," he said to Alvah. "Let's 
have the rest." 

"I'm going to ask you to do 
something difficult," said Alvah. 
"It's this— think about what I'm 



telling you. You're not thinking 
now, you're just reacting — " 

He heard a slight movement 
behind him, saw McArdle's eyes 
flicker and his hand make a Not 
now gesture. 

"You're in the same room with 
a man who's turned Muckfoot 
and it disgusts you. You'll be 
cured of that eventually — you 
can be, I'm the proof — but all I 
want you to do now it put it aside 
and use your brains. Here are 
the facts. Your raiding parties 
got the shorts beat off them. I 
saw one of the fights — it lasted 
about twenty minutes. The 
Muckfeet could have polished off 
the Cities any time in the last 
thirty years. They haven't'done 
it till now, because — " 

McArdle was beating time with 
his fingertips on the polished ebonite. He wasn't really listening, 
Alvah saw, but there was nothing 
for it except to go ahead. 

" — they had the problem of deconditioning and re-educating 
more than twenty million innocent people, or else letting them 
starve to death, Now they have 
the knowledge they need. They 
can — " 

"The terms," said McArdle. 

"They're going to close down 
this — this reservation," Alvah 
said. "They'll satisfy you in any 
way you like that they can do it 
by force. If you help, it can be 
an orderly process in which no


NATURAL STATE 



65 



body gets hurt and everybody 
gets the best possible break. And 
they'll keep the City intact as a 
museum. I talked them into that. 
Or, if they have to, they'll take 
the place apart slab by slab." 

McArdle's mouth was working 
violently. "Take him out and kill 
him, for City's sake! And, Morgan!" he called when Alvah and 
his guards were halfway to the 
door. . 

"Yes, Mr. Manager." 

"When you're through, dump 
him out the gate he came in." 

TT was a pity about Wytak, 
Alvah's brain was telling him 
frozenly. Wytak was a scoundrel 
or he* could never have got where 
he was — had been — but he wasn't 
afraid of a new idea. It might 
have been posssible to deal with 
Wytak. 

"Where we going to do it?" the 
younger one asked nervously. He 
had been pale and sweating in 
the floater all the way across 
Middle Jersey. 

"In the disinfecting chamber," 
Morgan said, gesturing with his 
pistol. "Then we haul him 
straight out. In there, you." 

"Well, let's get it over with," 
the younger one said. "I'm sick." 

"You think I'm not sick?" said 
Morgan in a strained voice. He 
gave Alvah a final shove into the 
middle of the room and stood 
back, adjusting his gun. 



Alvah found himself saying 
calmly, "Not that way. Morgan, 
unless you want to turn black 
and shrivel up a second after." 

"What's he talking about?" the 
boy whispered shakily. 

"Nothing," said Morgan. The 
hand with the gun moved indecisively. 

"To puncture me," Alvah 
warned, "you've got to puncture 
the suit. And I've been eating 
Muckfeet food for the last month 
and a half. I'm full of microorganisms — swarming with them. 
They'll bloop out of me straight 
at you, Morgan." 

Both men jerked back, as if 
they had been stung. "I'm getting outa here!" said the boy, 
grabbing for the door stud. 

Morgan blocked him. "Stay 
here!" 

"What're you going to do?" the 
younger one asked. 

He swore briefly. "We'll tell 
the O. D. Come on." 

The door closed and locked 
solidly behind them. Alvah looked to see if there was a way to 
double-lock it from his side, but 
there wasn't. He tried the opposite door to make sure it was 
locked, which it was. Then he 
examined the disinfectant nozzles, wondering if they could be 
used to squirt corrosive in on him. 
He decided they probably 
couldn't and, anyhow, he had no 
way to spike the nozzles. Then 



66 




 



there was nothing to do but sit 
in the middle of the bare room 
and wait, which he did. 

The next thing that happened 
was that he heard a faint far-off 
continuous noise through the almost soundproof door. He stood 
up and went over and put his 
ear against the door, and decided 
it was his imagination. 

Then there was a noise, and he 
jumped back, his skin tingling all 
over, just before the door slid 
open. The sudden maniacal clangor of a bell swept Morgan into 
the room with it, wild-eyed, his 
cap missing, drooling from a corner of his mouth, his gun high in 
one white-knuckled fist. 

"Glah!" said Morgan and pulled the trigger. 

ALVAH'S heart went bonk 
hard against his ribs, and the 
room blurred. Then he realized 
that there hadn't been any hiss 
of an ejected pellet. And he was 
still on his feet. And Morgan, 
with his mouth stretched open all 
the way back to the uvula, was 
standing there a yard away, staring at him and pulling the trigger repeatedly. 

Alvah stepped forward half a 
pace and put a straight left 
squarely on the point of Morgan's jaw. As the man fell, there 
were shrieks and running footsteps in the outer room. Somebody in Guard uniform plunged 



past the doorway, shouting incoherently, caromed off a wall, 
dwindled down a corridor. Then 
the room was full of leaping men 
in motley. 

The first of them was Artie 
Brumbacher, almost unrecognizable because he was grinning 
from ear to ear. He handed Alvah 
a four-foot knobkerrie and a 
bulging skin bag and said, "Le's 
go!" 

The streets were full of grounded floaters and stalled surface 
cars. The bells had fallen silent, 
and so had the faint omnipresent 
vibration that was like silence 
itself until it was gone. Not a 
motor was turning in the Borough of Jersey. Occasional chittering sounds floated on the air, 
and muffled buzzings and other 
odd sounds, all against the background chorus of faraway shrieks 
that rose and fell. 

At the corner of Middle Orange 
and Weehawken, opposite the Superior Court Building, they came 
upon a squad of Regulars who 
had throwrl away their useless 
guns and picked up an odd lot of 
assorted bludgeons — lengths of 
pipe, tripods and the like. 

"Now you'll see," said Artie. 

The Regulars set up a ragged 
yell and came running forward. 
The two Muckfeet on either side 
of Alvah, Artie and the bucktoothed one called Lafe, dipped 
heaping dark-brown handfuls out

of the bags they carried slung 
from their shoulders. Alvah followed suit, and recognized the 
stuff at last — bran meal, soaked 
in some fragrant syrup until it 
was mucilaginous and heavy. 

Artie swung first, then Lafe, 
and Alvah last — and the soggy 
lumps smacked the foremost 
faces. The squad broke, wiping 
frenziedly. But you couldn't wipe 
the stuff off. It clung coldly and 
grainily to the hair on the backs 
of your hands and your eyelashes 
and the nap of your clothing. All 
you could do was move it around. 

One berserker with a smeared 
face didn't stop, and Lafe dropped him with a knobkerrie between the eyes. One more, a 
white-faced youth, stood miraculously untouched, still hefting his 
club. He took a stride forward 
menacingly. 

Grinning, Artie raised another 
glob of the mash and ate it, 
smacking his lips. The youth 
spun around, walked drunkenly 
to the nearest wall and was rackingly sick. 

A N hour later, Knickerbocker 
Circle in Over Manhattan 
was littered with ameba-shaped 
puddles of clear plastic. Overhead, the stuff was hanging in 
festoons from the reticulated 
framework of the Roof and, for 
the first time in a century, an 
unfiltered wind was blowing into 



New York. Halfway up the sheer 
facade of the Old Movie House, 
the roc that had brought Alvah 
from Jersey was flapping along, 
a wingtip almost brushing the 
louvers, while its rider sprinkled 
pale dust from a sack. Farther 
down the street, a sickly green 
growth was already visible on 
cornices and window frames. 

The antique neon sign of the 
Old Movie dipped suddenly, its 
supports softened visibly. It 
swung, nodded and crashed to 
the pavement. 

Three hours later, a little group 
of whey-faced men in official 
dress was being loaded aboard a 
freight roc opposite the underpass to the Cauldwell Floatway 
in Over Bronnix. Alvah thought 
he saw McArdle among them, 
but he couldn't be sure. 

Twilight — all the streets that 
radiated from the heart of the 
City were afloat with long, slowly 
surging tides of humanity, dim 
in the weak glow from the lumen 
globes plastered haphazardly to 
the flanks of the buildings. At the 
end of every street, the Wall was 
crumbled down and the moat 
filled, its fire long gone out. And 
down the new railed walkways 
from all three levels came the 
men, women and children, stumbling out into the alien lumenlit night and the strange scents 
and the wide world. 

Watching from the hilltop,

with his arm around his wife's 
waist, Alvah saw them being 
herded into groups and led away, 
unprotesting — saw them in the 
wains, rolling off toward the temporary shelters where, likely as 
not, they would sleep the night 
through, too numbed to be afraid 
of the morrow. 

In the morning, their teaching 
would begin. 

Babylon, Alvah thought, 
Thebes, Angkor, Lagash, Agade, 
Tyre, Luxor, and now New York. 

A City grew out and then in — 
it was always the way, whether 
or not it had a Barrier around it. 



Growing, -it crippled itself and 
its people — and died. The weeds 
overgrew its felled stones. 

"Like an egg," B. J. said, although he had not spoken. 
"Omne ex ovum — but the eggshell has to break." 

"I know," said Alvah, discovering that the empty ache in his 
belly was not sentiment but 
hunger. "Speaking of eggs — " 

B. J. gave his arm a reassuring 
little pat. "Anything you want, 
dear. Radnip, orangoe, pearots, 
fleetmeat — you pick the menu." 

Alvah's mouth began to water.

LULUNGOMEENA 



BLAME Clay Harbank, if 
you will, for what happened at Station 563 of 
the Sirius Sector; or blame William Peterborough, whom we 
called the Kid. I blame no one. 
But I am a Dorsai man. 

The trouble began the day 
the kid joined the station, with 
his quick hands and his gambler's 
mind, and found that Clay, alone 
of all the men there, would 
not gamble with him — for all that 
he claimed to having been a gambling man himself. And so it ran 
on for four years of service together. 

But the beginning of the end 
was the day they came off shift 
together. 

They had been out on a duty 
circuit of the frontier station that 
housed the twenty of us — searching the outer bubble for signs of 
blows or leaks. It's a slow two 
hour tramp, that duty, even outside the station on the surface of 
the asteroid where there's no 
gravity to speak of. We, in the 
recreation room, off duty, could 
tell by the sound of their voices 
as the inner port sucked open 
and the clanging clash of them 
removing their spacesuits came 
echoing to us along the metal 
corridor, that the Kid had been 
needling Clay through the whole 
tour. 

"Another day," came the Kid's 
voice, "another fifty credits. And 

71 



how's the piggy bank coming 
along, Clay?" 

7T1HERE was a slight pause, and 
-■- I could see Clay carefully 
controlling his features and his 
voice. Then his pleasant baritone, 
softened by the burr of his Tarsusian accent, came smoothly to 
us. 

"Like a gentleman, Kid,'* he 
answered. "He never overeats and 
so he runs no danger of indigestion." 

It was a neat answer, based on 
the fact that the Kid's own service account was swollen with his 
winnings from the rest of the 
crew. But the Kid was too thickskinned for rapier thrusts. He 
laughed; and they finished removing their equipment and came 
on into the recreation room. 

They made a striking picture 
as they entered, for they were 
enough alike to be brothers — although father and son would have 
been a more likely relationship, 
considering the difference in their 
ages. Both were tall, dark, wideshouldered men with lean faces, 
but experience had weathered 
the softer lines from Clay's face 
and drawn thin parentheses about 
the corners of his mouth. There 
were other differences, too; but 
you could see in the Kid the 
youth that Clay had been, and in 
Clay the man that the Kid would 
some day be. 



"Hi, Clay," I said. 

"Hello, Mort," he said, sitting 
down beside me. 

"Hi, Mort," said the Kid. 

I ignored him; and for a moment he tensed. I could see the 
anger flame up in the ebony 
depths of his black pupils under 
the heavy eyebrows. He was a big 
man; but I come from the Dorsai 
Planets and a Dorsai man fights 
to the death, if he fights at all. 
And, in consequence, among ourselves, we of Dorsai are a polite 
people. 

But politeness was wasted on 
the Kid — as was Clay's delicate 
irony. With men like the Kid, 
you have to use a club. 

We were in bad shape. The 
twenty of us at Frontier Station 
563, on the periphery of the human area just beyond Sirius, had 
gone sour, and half the men had 
applications in for transfer. The 
trouble between Clay and the 
Kid was splitting the station wide 
open. 

We were all in the Frontier 
Service for money; that was the 
root of the trouble. Fifty credits 
a day is good pay — but you have 
to sign up for a ten year hitch. 
You can buy yourself out — but 
that costs a hundred thousand. 
Figure it out for yourself. Nearly 
six years if you saved every penny 
you got. So most go in with the 
idea of staying the full decade. 

That was Clay's idea. He had 



72 




 



gambled most of his life away. 
He had won and lost several 
fortunes. Now he was getting old 
and tired and he wanted to go 
back — to Lulungomeena, on the 
little planet of Tarsus, which was 
the place he had come from as a 
young man. 

But he was through with gambling. He said money made that 
way never stuck, but ran away 
again like quicksilver. So he drew 
his pay and banked it. 

But the Kid was out for a 
killing. Four years of play with 
the rest of the crew had given 
him more than enough to buy his 
way out and leave him a nice 
stake. And perhaps he would have 
done just that, if it hadn't been 
that the Service account of Clay's 
drew him like an El Dorado. He 
could not go off and leave it. So 
he stayed with the outfit, riding the older man unmercifully. 

TTE harped continually on two 
themes. He pretended to disbelieve that Clay had ever been 
a gambler; and he derided Lulungomeena, Clay's birthplace : 
the older man's goal and dream, 
and the one thing he could be 
drawn into talk about. For, to 
Clay, Lulungomeena was beautiful, the most wonderful spot in 
the Universe; and with an old 
man's sick longing for home, he 
could not help sayirfg so. 

"Mort," said the Kid, ignoring 



the rebuff and sitting down beside us, "what's a Hixabrod like?" 

My club had not worked so 
well, after all. Perhaps, I, too, 
was slipping. Next to Clay, I was 
the oldest man on the crew, which 
was why we were close friends. 
I scowled at the Kid. 

"Why?" I asked. 

"We're having one for a visi- tor," he said. 

Immediately, all talk around 
the recreation room ceased and 
all attention was focused on the 
Kid. All aliens had to clear 
through a station like ours when 
they crossed the frontier from 
one of the other great galactic 
power groups into human territory. But isolated as Station 563 
was, it was seldom an alien came 
our way, and when one did, it 
was an occasion. 

Even Clay succumbed to the 
general interest. "I didn't know 
that," he said. "How'd you find 
out?" 

"The notice came in over the 
receiver when you were down 
checking the atmosphere plant," 
answered the Kid with a careless 
wave of his hand. "I'd already 
filed it when you came up. 
What'U he be like, Mort?" 

I had knocked around more 
than any of them — even Clay. 
This was my second stretch in 
the Service. I remembered back 
about twenty years, to the Denebian Trouble. 



LULUNGOMEENA

"Stiff as a poker," I said. 
"Proud as Lucifer, honest as sunlight and tight as a camel on his 
way through the eye of a needle. 
Sort of a humanoid, but with a 
face like a collie dog. You know 
the Hixabrodian reputation, don't 
you?" 

Somebody at the back of the 
crowd said no, although they may 
have been doing it just to humor 
me. Like Clay with his Lulungomeena, old age was making me 
garrulous. 

"They're the first and only 
mercenary ambassadors in the 
known Universe," I said. "A 
Hixabrod can be hired, but he 
can't be influenced, bribed or 
forced to come up with anything 
but the cold truth — and, brother, 
it's cold the way a Hixabrod 
serves it up to you. That's why 
they're so much in demand. If 
any kind of political dispute 
comes up, from planetary to inter-alien power group levels, 
both sides have to hire a Hixabrod to represent them in the 
discussions. That way they know 
the other side is being honest with 
them. The opposing Hixabrod is 
a living guarantee of that." 

"He sounds good," said the 
Kid. "What say we get together 
and throw him a good dinner 
during his twenty-four hour stopover?" 

"You won't get much in the 
way of thanks from him," I 



grunted. "They aren't built that 
way." 

"Let's do it anyway," said the 
Kid. "Be a little excitement for 
a change." 

A MURMUR of approval ran 
through the room. I was outvoted. Even Clay liked the idea. 

"Hixabrods eat what we eat, 
don't they?" asked the Kid, making plans. "Okay, then, soups, 
salad, meats, champagne and 
brandy — " he ran on, ticking the 
items off on his fingers. For a 
moment, his enthusiasm had us 
all with him. But then, just at 
the end, he couldn't resist getting 
in one more dig at Clay. 

"Oh, yes," he finished, "and for 
entertainment, you can tell him 
about Lulungomeena, Clay." 

Clay winced — not obviously, 
but we all saw a shadow cross 
his face. Lulungomeena on Tarsus, his birthplace, held the same 
sort of obsession for him that his 
Service account held for the Kid; 
but he could not help being aware 
that he was prone to let his tongue 
run away on the subject of its 
beauty. For it was where he belonged, in the stomach-twisting, 
throat-aching way that sometimes only talk can relieve. 

I was a Dorsai man and older 
than the rest. I understood. No 
one should make fun of the bond 
tying a man to his home world. 
It is as real as it is intangible. 



74 




 



And to joke about it is cruel. 

But the Kid was too young to 
know that yet. He was fresh from 
Earth — Earth, where none of the 
rest of us had been, yet which, 
hundreds of years before, had 
been the origin of us all. He was 
eager and strong and contemptuous of emotion. He saw, as the 
rest of us recognized also, that 
Clay's tendency to let his talk 
wander ever to the wonder of 
Lulungomeena was the first slight 
crack in what had once been a 
man of unflawed steel. It was the 
first creeping decay of age. 

But, unlike the rest of us, who 
hid our boredom out of sympathy, the Kid saw here a chance 
to break Clay and his resolution 
to do no more gambling. So he 
struck out constantly at this one 
spot so deeply vital that Clay's 
self-possession was no defense. 

Now, at this last blow, the 
little fires of anger gathered in 
the older man's eyes. 

"That's enough," he said 
harshly. "Leave Lulungomeena 
out of the discussion." 

"I'm willing to," said the Kid. 
"But somehow you keep reminding me of it. That and the story 
that you once were a gambler. If 
you won't prove the last one, 
how can you expect me to believe all you say about the first?" 

The veins stood out on Clay's 
forehead; but he controlled himself. 



"I've told you a thousand 
times," he said between bis teeth. 
"Money made by gambling 
doesn't stick. YouH find that out 
for yourself one of these days." 

"Words," said the Kid airily. 
"Only words." 

For a second, Clay stood staring whitely at him, not even 
breathing. I don't know if the 
Kid realized his danger or cared, 
but I didn't breathe, either, until 
Clay's chest expanded and he 
turned abruptly and walked out 
of the recreation room. We heard 
his bootsteps die away down the 
corridor toward his room in the 
dormitory section. 

T ATER, I braced the Kid about 
it. It was his second shift 
time, when most of the men in 
the recreation room had to go on 
duty. I ran the Kid to the ground 
in the galley where he was fixing 
himself a sandwich. He looked 
up, a little startled, more than a 
little on the defensive, as I came 
in. 

"Oh, hi, Mort," he said, with a 
pretty good imitation of casualness. "What's up?" 

"You," I told him. "Are you 
looking for a fight with Clay?" 

"No," he drawled with his 
mouth full. "I wouldn't exactly 
say that." 

"Well, that's what you're liable 
to get." 

"Look, Mort," he said, and 



LULUNGOMEENA

then paused until he had swallowed. "Don't you think Clay's 
old enough to look after himself?" 

I felt a slight and not unpleasant shiver run down between my 
shoulder-blades and my eyes began to grow hot. It was my 
Dorsai blood again. It must have 
showed on my face, for the Kid, 
who had been sitting negligently 
on one edge of the galley table, 
got up in a hurry. 

"Hold on, Mort," he said. 
"Nothing personal." 

I fought the old feeling down 
and said as calmly as I could, 
"I just dropped by to tell you 
something. Clay has been around 
a lot longer than you have. I'd 
advise you to lay off him." 

"Afraid he'll get hurt?" 

"No," I answered. "I'm afraid 
you will." 

The Kid snorted with sudden 
laughter, half choking on his 
sandwich. "Now I get it. You 
think I'm too young to take care 
of myself." 

"Something like that, but not 
the way you think. I want to tell 
you something about yourself and 
you don't have to say whether 
I'm right or wrong — you'll let me 
know without words." 

"Hold it," he said, turning red. 
"I didn't come out here to get 
psyched." 

"You'll get it just the same. 
And it's not for you only — it's for 



all of us, because men thrown 
together as closely as we are 
choose up sides whenever there's 
conflict, and that's as dangerous 
for the rest of us as it is for you." 

"Then the rest of you can 
stay out of it." 

"We can't," I said. "What affects one of us affects us all. 
Now I'll tell you what you're 
doing. You came out here expecting to find glamor and excitement. You found monotony 
and boredom instead, not realizing that that's what space is like 
almost all the time." 

TIE picked up his coffee container. "And now you'll say 
I'm trying to create my own excitement at Clay's expense. Isn't 
that tire standard line?" 

"I wouldn't know; I'm not going to use it, because that's not 
how I see what you're doing. 
Clay is adult enough to stand the 
monotony and boredom if they'll 
get him what he wants. He's also 
learned how to live with others 
and with himself. He doesn't have 
to prove himself by beating down 
somebody either half or twice his 
age." 

He took a drink and set the 
container down on the table. "And 
I do?" 

"All youngsters do. It's their 
way of experimenting with their 
potentialities and relationships 
with other people. When they find 



76 




 



that out, they can give it up — 
they're mature then — although 
some never do. I think you will, 
eventually. The sooner you stop 
doing it here, though, the better 
it'll be for you and us." 

"And if I don't?" he challenged. 

"This isn't college back on 
Earth or some other nice, safe 
home planet, where hazing can 
be a nuisance, but where it's possible to escape it by going somewhere else. There isn't any 'somewhere else' here. Unless the one 
doing the hazing sees how reckless 
and dangerous it is, the one getting hazed takes it as long as he 
can — and then something happens." 

"So it's Clay you're really worried about, after all." 

"Look, get it through your 
skull. Clay's a man and he's been 
through worse than this before. 
You haven't. If anybody's going 
to get hurt, it'll be you." 

He laughed and headed for the 
corridor door. He was still laughing as it slammed behind him. I 
let him go. There's no use pushing a bluff after it's failed to 
work. 

PT^HE next day, the Hixabrod 
came. His name was Dor 
Lassos. He was typical of his 
race, taller than the tallest of us 
by half a head, with a light green 
skin and that impassive Hixa


brodian canine face. 

I missed his actual arrival, being up in the observation tower 
checking meteor paths. The station itself was well protected, but 
some of the ships coming in from 
time to time could have gotten in 
trouble with a few of the larger 
ones that slipped by us at intervals in that particular sector. 
When I did get free, Dor Lassos 
had already been assigned to his 
quarters and the time of official 
welcoming was over. 

I went down to see him anyhow on the off-chance that we 
had mutual acquaintances either 
among his race or mine. Both of 
our peoples are few enough in 
number, God knows, so the possibility wasn't too far-fetched. 
And, like Clay, I yearned for anything connected with my home. 

"Wet velt cThatchen, Hixabrod — " I began, walking into his 
apartment — and stopped short. 

The Kid was there. He looked 
at me with an odd expression 
on his face. 

"Do you speak Hixabrodian?" 
he asked incredulously. 

I nodded. I had learned it on 
extended duty during the Denebian Trouble. Then I remembered 
my manners and turned back to 
the Hixabrod; but he was already started on his answer. 

"En gles Ter, I tu, Dorsaiven," 
returned the collie face, expressionlessly. "Da Tr'amgen lang. 



LULUNGOMEEN A 



77 



Met zurres nebent?" 
. "Em getluc. Me mi Dorsai 
fene. Nono ne — ves luc Les Lassos?" 

He shook his head. 

Well, it had been a shot in the 
dark anyway. There was only the 
faintest chance that he had known 
our old interpreter at the time of 
the Denebian Trouble. The Hixabrods have no family system of 
nomenclature. They take their 
names from the names of older 
Hixabrods they admire or like. I 
bowed politely to him and left. 

It was not until later that it 
occurred to me to wonder what 
in the Universe the Kid could' 
find to talk about with a Hixabrod. 

T ACTUALLY was worried 
about Clay. Since my bluff 
with the Kid had failed, I 
thought I might perhaps try with 
Clay himself. At first I waited 
for an opportune moment to 
turn up; but following the last 
argument with the Kid, he'd been 
sticking to his quarters. I finally 
scrapped the casual approach and 
went to see him. 

I found him in his quarters, 
reading. It was a little shocking 
to find that tall, still athletic figure in a dressing gown like an old 
man, eyes shaded by the lean 
fingers of one long hand, poring 
over the little glow of a scanner 
with the lines unreeling before his 



eyes. But he looked up as I came 
in, and the smile on his face was 
the smile I had grown familiar 
with over four years of close 
living together. 

"What's that?" I asked, nodding at the book scanner. 

He set it down and the little 
light went out, the lines stopped 
unreeling. 

"A bad novel," he said, smiling, 
"by a poor author. But they're 
both Tarsusian." 

I took the chair he had indicated. "Mind if I speak straight 
out, Clay?" 

"Go ahead," he invited. 

"The Kid," I said bluntly. 
"And you. The two of you can't 
go on this way." 

"Well, old fire-eater," answered 
Clay lightly, "what've you got to 
suggest?" 

"Two things. And I want you 
to think both of them over carefully before answering. First, we 
see if we can't get up a ninetenths majority here in the station and petition him out as incompatible." 

CLAY slowly shook his head. 
"We can't do that, Mort." 
"I think I can get the signatures if I ask it," I said. "Everybody's pretty tired of him . . . 
They'd come across." 

"It's not that and you know 
it," said Clay. "Transfer by petition isn't supposed to be preju

dicial, but you and I know it is. 
He'd be switched to some hardcase station, get in worse trouble 
there, and end up in a penal post 
generally shot to hell. He'd know 
who to blame for it, and he'd 
hate us for the rest of his life." 

"What of it? Let him hate us." 

"I'm a Tarsusian. It'd bother 
me and I couldn't do it." 

"All right," I said. "Dropping 
that, "then, you've got nearly 
seven years in, total, and half the 
funds you need to buy out. I've 
got nearly enough saved, in spite 
of myself, to make up the rest. 
In addition, for your retirement, 
I'll sign over to you my pay for 
the three years I've got left. Take 
that and get out of the Service. 
It isn't what you figured on having, but half a loaf . . ." 

"And how about your homegoing?" he asked. 

"Look at me." 

He looked; and I knew what he 
was seeing — the broken nose, the 
scars, the lined face — the Dorsai 
face. 

"I'll never go home," I said. 

He sat looking at me for a long 
moment more, and I fancied I 
saw a little light burn deep in 
back of his eyes. But then the 
light went out and I knew that 
I'd lost with him, too. 

"Maybe not," he said quietly. 
"But I'm not going to be the one 
that keeps you from it." 

I left him to his book. 



OHIFTS are supposed to run 
^ continuously, with someone 
on duty all the time. However, 
for special occasions, like this 
dinner we had arranged for the 
Hixabrod, it was possible, by 
getting work done ahead of time 
and picking the one four hour 
stretch during the twenty-four 
when there were no messages or 
ships due in, to assemble everybody in the station on an offduty basis. 

So we were all there that evening, in the recreation room, 
which had been cleared and set 
up with a long table for the 
dinner. We finished our cocktails, 
sat down at the table and the 
meal began. 

As it will, the talk during the 
various courses turned to things 
outside the narrow limits of our 
present lives. Remembrances of 
places visited, memories of an 
earlier life, and the comparison 
of experiences, some of them 
pretty weird, were the materials 
of which our table talk was built. 

Unconsciously, all of us were 
trying to draw the Hixabrod out. 
But he sat in his place at the 
head of the table between Clay 
and myself, with the Kid a little 
farther down, preserving a frosty 
silence until the dessert had been 
disposed of and the subject of 
Media unepectedly came up. 

"—Media," said the Kid. "I've 
heard of Media. It's a little 



IUIUNGOMEEN A

planet, but it's supposed to have 
everything from soup to nuts on 
it in the way of life. There's 
one little life-form there that's 
claimed to contain something of 
value to every metabolism. It's 
called — let me see now — it's 
called—" 

"It is called nygti," supplied 
Dor Lassos, suddenly, in a metallic voice. "A small quadruped 
with a highly complex nervous 
system and a good deal of fatty 
tissue. I visited the planet over 
eighty years ago, before it was 
actually opened up to general 
travel. The food stores spoiled 
and we had the opportunity of 
testing out the theory that it will 
provide sustenance for almost any 
kind of known intelligent being." 

He stopped. 

"TfTELL?" demanded the Kid. 

"Since you're here to tell 
the story, I assume the animal 
kept you alive." 

"I and the humans aboard the 
ship found the nygti quite nourishing," said Dor Lassos. "Unfortunately, we had several Micrushni from Polaris also 
aboard." 

"And those?" asked someone. 

"A highly developed but inelastic life-form," said Dor 
Lassos, sipping from his brandy 
glass. "They went into convulsions and died." 

I had had some experience 



with Hixabrodian ways and I 
knew that it was not sadism, but 
a complete detachment that had 
prompted this little anecdote. 
But I could see a wave of distaste ripple down the room. No 
life-form is so universally well 
liked as the Micrushni, a delicate 
iridescent jellyfishlike race with 
a bent toward poetry and philosophy. 

The men at the table" drew 
away almost visibly from Dor 
Lassos. But that affected him no 
more than if they had applauded 
loudly. Only in very limited ways 
are the Hixabrod capable of empathy where other races are concerned. 

"That's too bad," said Clay 
slowly. "I have always liked the 
Micrushni." He had been drinking somewhat heavily and the 
seemingly innocuous statement 
came out like a half-challenge. 

Dor Lassos' cold brown eyes 
turned and rested on him. Whatever he saw, whatever conclusions he came to, however, were 
hidden behind his emotionless 
face. 

"In general," he said flatly, "a 
truthful race." 

That was the closest a Hixabrod could come to praise, and I 
expected the matter to drop there. 
But the Kid spoke up again. 

"Not like us humans," he said. 
"Eh, Dor Lassos?" 

I glared at him from behind 



80 




 



Dor Lassos' head. But he went 
recklessly on. 

"I said, 'Not like us humans, 
eh?'" he repeated loudly. The 
Kid had also apparently been 
drinking freely, and his voice 
grated on the sudden silence of 
the room. 

"The human race varies," 
stated the Hixabrod emotionlessly. "You have some individuals 
who approach truth. Otherwise, 
the human race is not notably 
truthful." 

It was a typical, deadly accurate Hixabrodian response. Dor 
Lassos would have answered in 
the same words if his throat was 
to have been cut for them the 
minute they left his mouth. 
Again, it should have shut the 
Kid up, and again it apparently 
failed. 

"Ah, yes," said the Kid. "Some 
approach truth, but in general 
we are untruthful. But you see, 
Dor Lassos, a certain amount of 
human humor is associated with 
lies. Some of us tell lies just for 
fun." 

r|OR Lassos drank from his 
brandy glass and said nothing. 

"Of course," the Kid went on, 
"sometimes a human thinks he's 
being funny with his lies when he 
isn't. Some lies are just boring, 
particularly when you're forced 
to hear them over and over again. 



But on the other hand, there are 
some champion liars who are so 
good that even you would find 
their untruths humorous." 

Clay sat upright suddenly, and 
the sudden start of his movement 
sent the brandy slopping out over 
the rim of his glass and onto the 
white tablecloth. He stared at the 
Kid. 

I looked at them all — at Clay, 
at the Kid and at Dor Lassos; 
and an ugly premonition began 
to form in my brain. 

"I do not believe I should," 
said Dor Lassos. 

"Ah, but you should listen to a 
real expert," said the Kid feverishly, "when he has a good subject to work on. Now, for example, take the matter of home 
worlds. What is your home world, 
Hixa, like?" 

I had heard enough and more 
than enough to confirm the suspicion forming within me. Without drawing any undue attention 
to myself, I rose and left the 
room. 

The alien made a dry sound in 
his throat and his voice followed 
me as I went swiftly down the 
empty corridor. 

"It is very beautiful," he said 
in his adding machine tones. 
"Hixa has a diameter of thirtyeight thousand universal meters. 
It possesses twenty-three great 
mountain ranges and seventeen 
large bodies of salt water . . ." 



LULUNGOMEENA 



81 



The sound of his voice died 
away and I left it behind me. 

I went directly through the 
empty corridors and up the ladder to the communications shack. 
I went in the door without pausing, without — in neglect of all 
duty rules — glancing at the automatic printer to see if any fresh 
message out of routine had arrived, without bothering to check 
the transmitter to see that it was 
keyed into the automatic location signal for approaching spacecraft. 

All this I ignored and went 
directly to the file where the incoming messages are kept. 

I flicked the tab and went back 
to the file of two days previous, 
skimming through the thick sheaf 
of transcripts under that dateline. 
And there, beneath the heading 
"Notices of Arrivals," I found it, 
the message announcing the coming of Dor Lassos. I ran my finger 
down past the statistics on our 
guest to the line of type that told 
me where the Hixabrod's last 
stop had been. 

Tarsus. 

/^LAY was my friend. And 
^ there is a limit to what a 
man can take without breaking. 
On a wall of the communications 
shack was a roster of the men at 
our station. I drew the Dorsai 
sign against the name of William 
Peterborough, and checked my 



gun out of the arms locker. 

I examined the magazine. It 
was loaded. I replaced the magazine, put the gun inside my jacket, and went back to the dinner. 

Dor Lassos was still talking. 

". . . The flora and the fauna 
are maintained in such excellent 
natural balance that no local 
surplus has exceeded one per cent 
of the normal population for any 
species in the last sixty thousand 
years. Life on Hixa is regular and 
predictable. The weather is controlled within the greatest limits 
of feasibility." 

As I took my seat, the machine 
voice of the Hixabrod hesitated 
for just a moment, then gathered 
itself, and went on: "One day I 
shall return there." 

"A pretty picture," said the 
Kid. He was leaning forward over 
the table now, his eyes bright, his 
teeth bared in a smile. "A very 
attractive home world. But I regret to inform you, Dor Lassos, 
that I've been given to understand that it pales into insignificance when compared - to one 
other spot in the Galaxy." 

The Hixabrod are warriors, too. 
Dor Lassos' features remained expressionless, but his voice deepened and rang through the room. 

"Your planet?" 

"I wish it were," returned the 
Kid with the same wolfish smile. 
"I wish I could lay claim to it. 
But this place is so wonderful 



82 




 



that I doubt if I would be allowed there. In fact," the Kid went 
on, "I have never seen it. But I 
have been hearing about it for 
some years now. And either it is 
the most wonderful place in the 
Universe, or else the man who 
has been telling me about it — " 
I pushed my chair back and 
started to rise, but Clay's hand 
clamped on my arm and held me 
down. 

"You were saying — " he said to 
the Kid, who had been interrupted by my movement. 

" — The man who has been telling me about it," said the Kid, 
deliberately, "is one of those 
champion liars I was telling Dor 
Lassos about." 

Once more "I tried to get to my 
feet, but Clay was there before 
me. Tall and stiff, he stood at the 
end of the table. 

"My right — " he said out of 
the corner of his moUth to me. 

Slowly and with meaning, he 
picked up his brandy glass and 
threw the glass straight into the 
Kid's face. It bounced on the 
table in front of him and sent 
brandy flying over the front of 
the Kid's immaculate dress uniform. 

"Get your gun!" ordered Clay. 

TVTOW the Kid was on his feet. 
-"■^ In spite of the fact that I 
knew he had planned this, emotion had gotten the better of him 



at the end. His face was white 
with rage. He leaned on the edge 
of the table and fought with himself to carry it through as he had 
originally intended. 

"Why guns?" he said. His voice 
was thick with restraint, as he 
struggled to control himself. 

"You called me a liar." 

"Will guns tell me if you are?" 
The Kid straightened up, breathing more easily; and his laugh 
was harsh in the room. "Why use 
guns when it's possible to prove 
the thing one way or another with 
complete certainty?" His gaze 
swept the room and came back 
to Clay. 

"For years now you've been 
telling me all sorts of things," 
he said. "But two things you've 
told me more than all the rest. 
One was that you used to be a 
gambler. The other was that Lulungomeena — your precious Lulungomeena on Tarsus — was the 
most wonderful place in the Universe. Is either one of those the. 
truth?" 

Clay's breath came thick and 
slow. 

"They're both the truth," he 
said, fighting to keep his voice 
steady. 

"Will you back that up?" 

"With my life!" 

"Ah," said the Kid mockingly, 
holding up his forefinger, "but 
I'm not asking you to back those 
statements up with your life — 



LULUNGOMEEN A 



83 



but with that neat little hoard 
you've been accumulating these 
past years. You claimed you're a 
gambler. Will you bet that those 
statements are true?" 

Now, for the first time, Clay 
seemed to see the trap. 

"Bet with me," invited the Kid, 
almost lightly. "That will prove 
the first statement." 

"And what about the second?" 
demanded Clay. 

"Why—" the Kid gestured with 
his hand toward Dor Lassos — 
"what further judge do we need? 
We have here at our table a Hixabrod." Half-turning to the alien, 
the Kid made him a little bow. 
"Let him say whether your second statement is true or not." 

Once more I tried to rise from 
my seat and again Clay's hand 
shoved me down. He turned to 
Dor Lassos. 

"Do you think you could judge 
such a point, sir?" he asked. 

The brown inhuman eyes met 
pis and held for a long moment. 

"I have just come from Tarsus," said the Hixabrod. "I was 
there as a member of the Galactic Survey Team, mapping the 
planet. It was my duty to certify 
to the truth of the map." 

npHE choice was no choice. 

Clay stood staring at the Hixabrod as the room waited for his 
answer. Rage burning within me, 
I looked down the table for a 



sign in the faces of the others that 
this thing might be stopped. But 
where I expected to see sympathy, there was nothing. Instead, 
there was blankness, or cynicism, 
or even the wet-lipped interest of 
men who like their excitement 
written in blood or tears. 

And I realized with a sudden 
sinking of hopes that I stood 
alone, after all, as Clay's friend. 
In my own approaching age and 
garrulity I had not minded his 
talk of Lulungomeena, hour on 
repetitive hour. But these others 
had grown weary of it. Where I 
saw tragedy, they saw only retribution coming to a lying bore. 

And what Clay saw was what 
I saw. His eyes went dark and 
cold. 

"How much will you bet?" he 
asked. 

"All I've got," responded the 
Kid, leaning forward eagerly. 
"Enough and more than enough 
to match that bank roll of yours. 
• The equivalent of eight years' 
pay." 

Stiffly, without a word, Clay 
produced his savings book and a 
voucher pad. He wrote out a 
voucher for the whole amount 
and laid book and voucher on the 
table before Dor Lassos. The Kid, 
who had obviously come prepared, did the same, adding a 
thick pile of cash from his gambling of recent weeks. 

"That's all of it?" asked Clay. 



84 




 



"All of it," said the Kid. 
Clay nodded and stepped back. 
"Go ahead," he said. 
The Kid turned toward the 
alien. 

"Dor Lassos," he said. "We appreciate your cooperation in this 
matter." 

"I am glad to hear it," responded the Hixabrod, "since my cooperation will cost the winner of 
the bet a thousand credits." 

The abrupt injection of this 
commercial note threw the Kid 
momentarily off stride. I, alone 
in the room, who knew the Hixabrod people, had expected it. But 
the rest had not, and it struck a 
sour note, which reflected back 
on the Kid. Up until now, the bet 
had seemed to most of the others 
like a cruel but at least honest 
game, concerning ourselves only. 
Suddenly it had become a little 
like hiring a paid bully to beat up 
a stationmate. 

But it was too late now to stop ; 
the bet had been made. Nevertheless, there were murmurs from 
different parts of the room. 

fFlHE Kid hurried on, fearful of 
an interruption. Clay's savings 
were on his mind. 

"You were a member of the 
mapping survey team?" he asked 
Dor Lassos. 

"I was," said the Hixabrod. 

"Then you know the planet?" 

"I do." 



. "You know its geography?" insisted the Kid. 

"I do not repeat myself." The 
eyes of the Hixabrod were chill 
and withdrawn, almost a little 
baleful, as they met those of the 
Kid. 

"What kind of a planet is it?" 
The Kid licked his lips. He was 
beginning to recover his usual 
self-assurance. "Is it a large 
planet?" 

"No." 

"Is Tarsus a rich planet?" 
"No." 

"Is it a pretty planet?" 

"I did not find it so." 

"Get to the point.'" snapped 
Clay with strained harshness. 

The Kid glanced at him, savoring this moment. He turned back 
to the Hixabrod. 

"Very well, Dor Lassos," he 
said, "we get to the meat of the 
matter. Have you ever heard of 
Lulungomeena ?" 

"Yes." 

"Have you ever been to Lulungomeena?" 
"I have." 

"And do you truthfully — " for 
the first time, a fierce and burning anger flashed momentarily in 
the eyes of the Hixabrod; the insult the Kid had just unthinkingly given Dor Lassos was a deadly 
one — "truthfully say that in your 
considered opinion Lulungomeena is the most wonderful 
place in the Universe?" 



LULUNGOMEENA 



85 



Dor Lassos turned his gaze 
away from him and let it wander 
over the rest of the room. Now, 
at last, his contempt for all there 
was plain to be read on his face. 

"Yes, it is," said Dor Lassos. 

TTE rose to his feet at the head 
of the stunned group around 
the table. From the pile of cash 
he extracted a thousand credits, 
then passed the remainder, along 
with the two account books and 
the vouchers, to Clay. Then he 
took one step toward the Kid. 

He halted before him and offered his hands to the man — 
palms up, the tips of his fingers 
a scant couple of inches short of 
the Kid's face. 

"My hands are clean," he said. 

His fingers arced; and, suddenly, as we watched, stubby, gleaming claws shot smoothly from 
those fingertips to tremble lightly 
against the skin of the Kid's face. 

"Do you doubt the truthfulness 
of a Hixabrod?" his robot voice 
asked. 

The Kid's face was white and 
his cheeks hollowed in fear. The 
needle points of the claws were 
very close to his eyes. He swallowed once. 

"No — " he whispered. 

The claws retracted. The hands 
returned to their owner's sides. 
Once more completely withdrawn 
and impersonal, Dor Lassos turned and bowed to us all. 




"My appreciation of your 
courtesy," he said, the metallic 
tones of his voice loud in the silence. 

Then he turned and, marching 
like a metronome, disappeared 
through the doorway of the recreation room and off in the direction of his quarters. 

" A ND so we part," said Clay 
Harbank as we shook hands. 
"I hope you find the Dorsai Planets as welcome as I intend to find 
Lulungomeena." 



86 




 



I grumbled a little. "That was 
plain damn foolishness. You 
didn't have to buy me out as 
well." 

"There were more than enough 
credits for the both of us," said 
Clay. 

It was a month after the bet 
and the two of us were standing 
in the Deneb One spaceport. For 
miles in every direction, the great 
echoing building of this central 
terminal stretched around us. In 
ten minutes I was due to board 
my ship for the Dorsai Planets. 



Clay himself still had several 
days to wait before one of the 
infrequent ships to Tarsus would 
be ready to leave. 

"The bet itself was damn foolishness," I went on, determined 
to find something to complain 
about. We Dorsai do not enjoy 
these moments of emotion. But a 
Dorsai is a Dorsai. I am not apologizing. 

• "No foolishness," said Clay. 
For a moment a shadow crossed 
his face. "You forget that a real 
gambler bets only on a sure 



LULUNGOMEEN A 



87 



thing. When I looked into the 
Hixabrod's eyes, I was sure." 

"How can you say 'a sure 
thing?' " 

"The Hixabrod loved his 
home," Clay said. 

I stared at him, astounded. 
"But you weren't betting on 
Hixa. Of course he would prefer 
Hixa to any other place in the 
Universe. But you were betting 
on Tarsus — on Lulungomeena — 
remember?" 

The shadow was back for a 
moment on Clay's face. "The bet 
was certain. I feel a little guilty 
about the Kid, but I warned him 
that gambling money never 
stuck. Besides, he's young and 
I'm getting old. I couldn't afford 
to lose." 

"Will you come down out of 
the clouds," I demanded, "and 
explain this thing? Why was the 



bet certain? What was the trick, 
if there was one?" 

"The trick?" repeated Clay. 
He smiled at me. "The trick was 
that the Hixabrod could not be 
otherwise than truthful. It was 
all in the name of my birthplace 
— Lulungomeena." 

He looked at my puzzled face 
and put a hand on my shoulder. 

"You see, Mort," he said quietly, "it was the name that fooled 
everybody. Lulungomeena stands 
for something in my language. 
But not for any city or town or 
village. Everybody on Tarsus has 
his own Lulungomeena. Everybody in the Universe has." 

"How do you figure that, 
Clay?" 

"It's a word," he explained. 
"A word in the Tarsusian language. It means 'home.' "

THE MAN WHO KNEW 

Back in 1893, while other tourists were paying to see Little Egypt's 
famous dance, a shrewd young chap instead bought sheets of commemorative postage stamps. Wise fellow, he later sent his children through college 
by selling his increasingly valuable hoard one by one. With so many people 
saving stamps now, a profit like that is unlikely. 

But there is a smart investment you can make today. Full sets of GALAXY 
are steadily bringing higher prices. If thafs true after only three .and a 
half years— well, you see what we mean. 

We don't have Vol. \, Nos. 1 and 2, and very few of the next few 
issues, but we'll sell whatever we do have at 35c each, postpaid. (Except 
overseas, of course; we have to charge 10c extra per copy for mailing.) 
That stamp-buyer knew a good thing when he saw it. So can you! Besides, 
who ever heard of reading postage stamps?

SMALL BODIES NEAR 
HEAVY PLANETS 

ONLY a few issues back, I 
devoted a portion of this 
column to the moons of 
Mars, prompted by repeated 
questions from readers who wondered whether they might not 
actually be Martian space stations, possibly still active, but 
more likely abandoned for ages. 
Well, they are unquestionably 
small natural moons. 

The reason I have to return 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 89 




to them today is an interesting 
thought advanced by the German astronomer Professor Dr. 
Werner Schaub, a former president of the Gesellschaft fur Weltraumforschung, the new German 
Rocket Society. In fact, Prof. 
Schaub spoke about his idea for 
the first time at a regional meeting of this society in May, 1953. 
Even more to the point is the 
fact that his idea grew out of 
a study of the forces which will 
act on a space station's structure. 

The idea is that the inner moon 
of Mars might be slowly — very 
slowly indeed — disintegrating 
under our very eyes. Professor 
Schaub is careful to call this a 
"working hypothesis," but until it 
might be demolished by a detailed mathematical analysis it 
sounds like a good one. 

However, a little background 
is needed first. 

A S some readers are likely to 
know, the two small moons 
of Mars were discovered in August, 1877, by Asaph Hall with 
the 26-inch telescope of the Naval 
Observatory. The discovery was 
a great surprise, not only because 
of the oft-told story of their 
"prediction" by Dean Swift, but 
because the two satellites of Mars 
were strange in several respects. 

They were tiny, appearing as 
luminous dots in even the biggest 



telescopes. Present estimates — 
which are a downward revision 
of earlier guesses — assign a diameter of not more than 10 miles 
to the inner moon (Phobos) and 
about 5 miles to the outer 
(Deimos). 

They also were most unusually 
close to their planet, the distance 
from the Martian surface to the 
outer moon being only 12,500 
miles and, from the surface to the 
inner moon, a mere 3700 miles, 
about the width of the Atlantic 
Ocean. This unheard-of nearness 
means that Phobos races around 
Mars in 7 hours and 39 minutes; 
its orbital velocity is 1.32 miles 
per second. 

The latter figure, incidentally, 
shows the weakness of the gravitational field of Mars. If the 
same moon circled Earth at the 
same distance from the Earth's 
center (5800 miles), it would be 
1850 miles from the surface and 
would need an orbital velocity 
of about 4 miles per second to 
stay in its orbit. Because the 
moonlet would need this much 
more orbital velocity to balance 
the Earth's stronger pull, it 
would also complete a full revolution in a much shorter time, 
namely a little more than 2J/£ 
hours. 

It took half a century, counting from the original discovery 
by Asaph Hall, to find out that 
the orbital velocity of Phobos 



90 




 




A small moon circling its planet 
near Roche's Limit, losing portions 
of its surface due to the tidal forces 
of the planet. The dotted line around 
the planet indicates the approximate limits of its atmosphere. The 
heavy circle is the orbit of the 
satellite. The fine lines show the 
orbits of the separated particles. 

is slowly increasing! Such an in, crease in orbital velocity can 
mean only one thing — the distance of Phobos from Mars is 
slowly decreasing. As I understand it, the decrease of the dis' tance has not actually been measured yet, but the increase in 
speed has. It probably is easier 
to observe a small increase of the 
orbital velocity than a tiny 
shrinkage of the orbital distance. 
But that the two go together is 
established beyond a doubt. 

The next question, of course, 
is "Why?" 

Generally speaking, a moon 
will increase its speed if it finds 
a small amount of resistance 



along its orbit. This statement 
may seem paradoxical to somebody not used to the workings 
of celestial mechanics, but it is 
true just the same. 

The first result of finding some * 
resistance along the orbit would 
be to slow the movement of the 
moon. But that would result in 
the moon no longer having 
enough speed to balance the pull 
of the planet for the distance at 
which it is located. The planet 
could pull it a little nearer, but 
in "falling" toward the planet, 
speed would be gained and the 
moon would establish a new balance slightly closer to the planet 
at a slightly higher speed. So if 
cosmic dust got in the way of 
Phobos, the observed increase in 
orbital velocity could be explained. And from the observed increase in speed, one could calculate the density of the cosmic 
dust which caused it. 

OUCH calculations were made 
^ by Kerr and Whipple, but no 
acceptable results could be obtained. If cosmic dust near Mars 
were as thick as required, we 
should be able to see it. After 
all, one cannot very well postulate that the dust is only in the' 
moon's orbit and not anywhere 
else. Besides, dust of the proper 
density and spread through a 
large volume of space, as would 
be likely, should slow down 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



91 



Deimos, too, but Deimos is not 
affected. If Mars had as much 
water as our own planet, one 
might try to explain the misbehavior of Phobos by tidal action — but Mars does not have 
much water. 

Yet this apparently impossible 
assumption of a cosmic dust 
handicap for Phobos, which can 
be found only in and near its 
orbit, is Dr. Werner Schaub's 
"working hypothesis." One can 
make this assumption if it is 
also assumed that the dust comes 
from Phobos itself, for Phobos is 
rather close to Roche's Limit. 

Roche's Limit, as has been 
stated- many a time in many science fiction stories, is the distance 
inside of which a moon cannot 
exist any more, since the gravitational force of the planet 
would break it up and scatter 
the remains along its orbit to 
form a ring. This explanation is 
essentially true, except that things 
aren't quite that simple. The distance R' (Roche's Limit) for a 
given planet is 

R' = 2.4554 R 
(where R is the planet radius) 
measured from the planet's center if both planet and moon have 
the same specific gravity. If they 
haven't, the figure must be modified by multiplying it with the 
cube root of the ratio of their 
densities. 

Without such modification, R' 



equals 9700 miles for our own 
planet and 5155 miles for Mars. 
Since Phobos is 5800 miles from 
the center of Mars, its distance is 
about 2.75 R, so that, for equal 
densities, it would be safely outside of R'. If Phobos were a ball 
of liquid, it would be badly deformed even where it is, but it is 
obviously some kind of rigid 
rock. 

Now there is another kind of 
limit proposed by Dr. Schaub 
specifically for rigid bodies and 
bodies with considerable structural strength, such as space stations, which lies at 1.3 R. At a 
distance of 3/ 10th of a planet 
radius from the planet's surface, 
the tidal forces of the planet become stronger than the gravitation of the moon at its surface. 
The result is that the existence 
of the moon itself is not endangered, but that everything 
lying around loose will be pulled 
off its surface! 

Like Roche's Limit of 2.45, this 
limit of 1.3 is modified by the 
ratio of the densities of the two 
bodies involved. To make Phobos 
fall inside this limit, or rather to 
expand this limit to the distance 
of Phobos, one would have to assume that its overall density is 
half of that of an equal volume 
of water. If Phobos consists of 
very porous rock, this is possible. 
In this case, nothing could lie 
around on its surface, anchored 



92 




 



only by the moonlet's gravitational pull. But whatever has 
been pulled off by Mars would 
not fall to the planet at once. It 
would form two very tenuous 
rings, one outside the moon and 
one inside. Each one of these 
tenuous rings would have a thickness about equal to the diameter 
of the moon and a width of at 
most three times the diameter 
of the moon. (See diagram.) 

A T first, the moon would move 
in an empty space between 
the two rings, but this space 
would not remain empty for long. 
As soon as there are enough particles in the rings, there will be 
collisions. Normally, when two 
particles collide, one can expect 
both of them to lose speed, so 
that they would cross from the 
outer ring into the inner ring. 
The outer ring, then, would 
steadily lose mass to the inner 
ring — which is likely to get into 
Phobos' way while crossing over 
— but the inner ring would lose 
mass in the same manner. If a 
particle collision occurs in \he 
inner ring, the new orbits of the 
particles can be eccentric enough 
to graze the atmosphere of Mars, 
which obviously means their end 
as independent molecular satellites. 

More "loose mass" on Phobos 
will be created steadily, some of 
it by meteorite impact, most of it 



probably by cosmic rays. Their 
microscopic impacts cause the 
crystalline structure of the surface rocks to decay, thus creating dust. This is happening on 
our moon, too, but there the dust 
stays where it is, protecting the 
layers of rock underneath. On 
Phobos, if Dr. Schaub is right, 
the dust would be pulled off the 
satellite as quickly as it is formed. 

It is admittedly somewhat farfetched to extend the second limit 
so far out by assuming an unusually low density for the satellite. But remember that Phobos 
does show the acceleration which 
started the whole trend of 
thought. 

And it is, at any event, interesting that Jupiter V, the moon 
closest to the giant planet, shows 
a similar acceleration. Jupiter V 
is also comparatively small (estimated diameter is 100 miles) and 
moves at a distance of 112,600 
miles from Jupiter's center or 
about 70,000 miles from its "surface." R' for Jupiter (unmodified) is 108,800 miles. In short, 
the situation is about the same — 
theoretically, the moon just manages to stay outside of Roche's 
Limit, but if we knew all the 
other factors, most especially the 
satellite's density, we might say 
otherwise. 

Let's close with a look at our 
planned space station in Dr. von 
Braun's two-hour orbit, 1075 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



93 



miles above sea level. This is a 
geocentric distance of 5025 miles 
and R' for Earth, as mentioned, 
is 9700 miles. The space station 
would be well within Roche's 
Limit, but would hold together 
easily because of its structural 
strength. (Just to keep air inside, it has to have a higher 
structural strength than required 
to withstand the forces exerted 
by the Earth.) Since the space 
station's distance amounts to 1.27 
planet radii and Dr. Schaub's 
limit is 1.3 R, the space station 
would also be inside that limit. 

This would not endanger people in spacesuits working near it 
in space. Even if not hooked 
to a line, they would have personal rocket propulsion guns 
which can easily overcome the 
forces involved. 

But the Earth would keep the 
space station spotlessly clean by 
attracting any debris that might 
accumulate on it — a cosmic 
vacuum ' cleaner, you might say. 

EUROPE'S UNKNOWN 
POISONOUS LIZARD 

A T about the time you read 
this, West Germans and 
West Berliners will be able to 
buy and read a German edition 
of. my book The Lungfish, the 
Dodo and the Unicorn. In East 
Germany, it will indubitably be 
banned because animals fail to 



conform to Marxist-LeninistStalinist principles (it being 
known, furthermore, that Beria 
occasionally petted animals, 
never tractors). I did not do the 
translation myself, but I checked 
it and in the course of this work 
I came across some old correspondence and notes which had 
half-slipped my memory. They 
dealt with the question of poisonous animals in general and specifically with the number of poisonous lizards. 

One hundred years ago, zoological textbooks were quite definite on that point. The majority 
of poisonous creatures were invertebrates — spiders, scorpions, 
centipedes and certain true insects. Of the vertebrate animals, 
only some snakes were known to 
be poisonous, 'although a few 
fishes were said to have poisonous 
spikes, something that still needed verification (which has been 
supplied in the meantime). No 
lizard or amphibian had any 
venom, the book said. 

As for amphibians, it became 
known during the following fifty 
years that the skin secretions of 
several varieties are rather poisonous and that one frog (the 
beautiful "painter frog," Dendrobates tinctorius of Central 
and northern South America) is 
dangerous to handle. It can kill 
you if you happen to have fresh 
cuts on your hands. Logically, 



94 




 



the natives use its skin secretion 
for a highly effective arrowhead 
poison. 

About 1900, the textbooks, 
after much reluctance, suspicion 



one-third the length one would 
expect a lizard's tail to be. The 
legs are short and small and the 
whole animal looks as if it were 
normally a dirty black, but has 




Heloderma suspectum. 



and cross-checking, admitted 
that there is a poisonous lizard. 
The lizard thus accepted is, of 
course, the Gila monster, a native 
of Arizona and New Mexico. The 
popular name is derived from the 
name of the Gila (prounced 
Hee-la) River. The scientific 
name is Heloderma suspectum. 

It is a creature that nobody 
who has seen one will ever forget, 
partly because of its coloration, 
partly because its shape is rather 
different from the ideas evoked 
by the word "lizard." Yes, it has 
a head, a body, a tail and four 
legs, but that's as far as the resemblance goes. The head is flat, 
the body like a stuffed sausage, 
the tail more so and only about 



been spattered with brick-red 
paint. 

While normally lazy, the Gila 
monster can develop a fit of 
temper at short notice. It will hiss 
loudly and can jump, especially 
making a 180 degree turn in 
one jump that puts the head 
where the tail was a moment ago. 
And when it bites, it does not 
strike like a snake. It is a bite 
more like that of a dog and it 
will hang on for as long as ten 
minutes. 

"IVTOBODY seems to know who 
' produced the first comprehensive description of this lizard. 
European works name Francesco 
Hernandez, body physician of 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



95 



Philip II of Spain, as the "discoverer" (*), but I have some 
doubts about that. Hernandez 
collected — from 1 593- 1600 — in 
Mexico, where the Gila monster 
does not live. 

Even though Nueva Espana, 
if it could be pinned down on a 
map, probably comprised Gilamonster habitat, Hernandez hardly traveled that far west. It is 
far more likely that he "discovered" Gila monster's close 
relative, the Mexican Beaded 
Lizard {Heloderma horridum), 
which is similar in appearance, 
but of a more slender build, somewhat larger (or at least longer) 
and with bright yellow blotches 
on a shining dark background. 
It was this Mexican version that 
forced its way into the textbooks 
as the second poisonous lizard, 
though it was the first historically. 

Among the venomous snakes, 
there are some with hollow poison 
fangs and some with grooved 
poison fangs. The two types of 
Heloderma have grooved teeth, 
but unlike those of the venomous 
snakes, these teeth are not in 
front of the mouth and are in the 
lower jaw. So is the poison gland 
which supplies them. Another 

1 Doctor Hernandez' work never appeared in its original Latin version. It 
was printed in 1615 as Quatro libros de 
la naturaleza y virtutes de las plantas 
y animates que estan recevidos en el 
uso de medicina en la nueva Espana. 



difference is that they need time 
to inject their poison, and a man 
bitten by Heloderma may get 
away with "just a bite" if he 
succeeds in tearing the reptile 
off at once. Normally, the Gila 
monster has little use for its 
poison apparatus, for its favorite 
food seems to be bird and snake 
eggs. 

So far we have stayed in the 
territory of well-known and 
established facts. The story has 
many loose ends, since very many 
facts about the two Helodermas 
are still unknown. But the most 
interesting loose end is that they 
may have unknown relatives elsewhere. 

One such suspected relative has 
a name of its own, Lanthanotus, 
and it lives, of all places, on 
Borneo. The trouble is that very 
little is known about it — so little, 
in fact, that we cannot yet say 
with certainty whether Lanthanotus actually is a close relative 
to the Gila monster. 

Another suspected relative 
might live in Europe. The trouble 
here is the same as with Lanthanotus, but to a higher degree 
— it hasn't been discovered yet. 

All along the European Alps, 
but especially in the sections belonging to Switzerland and to 
Austria, there has been talk for 
centuries about a rare, small and 
dangerous animal. It is said to be 
some two feet long — which is 



96 




 



slightly larger than Heloderma — 
and of the general appearance of 
a fat lizard. It is reported to hiss 
and whistle, and its bite is described as deadly. Witnesses 
claim that it can make jumps 
without preparation. Since the 
Alpine farmers and cattle ranchers were not hi the habit of 
traveling, the animal has a name 




The only published picture of a 
Tatzelwurm, dating from 1836. 



of its own in almost every valley. 
The most common names are 
Stollwurm, Springwurm and 
Tatzelwurm, which can be translated, in the same order, as "Cave 
Worm," "Jumping Worm" and 



"Worm with Paws" and it may 
be added that the term "worm" 
is not used in its zoological sense 
among those peoples, but a general term for anything alive of 
wormlike or snakelike shape. 

TN some older works, the exist -■• ence of this animal is mentioned as a matter of course. The 
chronicle of a monastery in the 
Swiss Canton of Uri referred to 
it as occurring in the vicinity. 
A "Pocketbook for Amateur 
Naturalists and Gentleman Hunters," printed in 1836, even printed a picture (not a good one) 
and a Bavarian writer by the 
name of Kobell listed the animal 
in 1859 as one "permitted to be 
hunted." He did not shoot one 
himself, but knew people who 
had. 

There is one more curious 
"document." In the Bavarian and 
Austrian Alps, it is customary to 
erect little monuments to people 
who perished because of avalanches or falling stones as close 
as possible to the spot where they 
died. One of these monuments — 
their local name is Marterln — 
has the inscription "In sudden 
fright died here, pursued by 
jumping worms, Hans Fuchs of 
Unken, 1779." The painting 
shows the dead Hans Fuchs lying 
on the ground, with two large 
lizards perched on a nearby rock. 
These two lizards are ordinary

in shape, just large; obviously 
trie local artist not only lacked 
talent, but also a model. 

The animal is still undiscovered. For some time, from about 
1870 to 1930, zoologists were 
inclined to consider the whole 
story a legend. In 1930, a scientific publication began to collect 
eye-witness reports and got 
around two dozen first-hand 
stories, most of the reporters 
stating emphatically that the 
animal was not an otter, which 
had been cited as an explanation 
of the legend by some. But none 
of the reporters had any proof — 
no skins, no skulls, not even 
photographs. 

At about that time, somebody 
sent me a clipping from a small 
provincial Austrian newspaper, 
saying in so many words that the 
late Austrian General von Poser 
had killed two of the animals 
and that their bodies were preserved in Castle Grubhof near 
the city of Lofer. 

I had no idea where Lofer was 
located (I still don't know), but 
trusted that the Austrian Post 
Office did. Nor did I know who 
owned the castle at that time, but 
since every castle has a Superintendent General, I put that on 
my letter, which was aimed at 
somebody who could tell horses 
and cattle apart, but had never 
tried to distinguish a lizard from 
a newt. 



The result was similar to the 
scene they used to have in the 
early talkies, where an American 
traveler in Hongkong addresses a 
Chinese in pidgin and gets an 
answer with an Oxford accent. A 
Mr. Schmidtmann informed me 
that the two preserved animals 
were specimens of the East North 
African monitor, probably Varanus niloticus, shot by General 
von Poser during a vacation in 
Egypt. Besides, Mr. Schmidt- . 
mann added, even though some 
witnesses claim they know an 
otter when they see one, the reports still concern otters. 

A BOUT a month later, I read 
an article by the former 
Austrian Court Councellor, Dr. 
Nicolussi, in which he stated that, 
after examining all the evidence, 
he felt so certain about the 
existence of the animal and its 
essential relationship to the American Gila monster that he proposed the scientific name of 
Heloderma europaeum. At about 
that time a Swiss photographer 
took a picture of something that 
might be the animal, half hidden 
under dead leaves, but a search 
failed to yield results. 

One more item: After the first 
edition of my book The Lungfish 
and the Unicorn had been published, I received a letter from a 
reader in Virginia who, in 1900, 
had seen a big lizard in the Ital


98 




 



ian Alps. His friends to whom he 
told the tale scoffed, so he went 
back to the same spot the next 
day, saw two of the big lizards 
and caught one with a butterfly 
net. When dumped at the inn, 
the lizard scared him so much 
with loud hissing that he caught 
it in the net again, obtained a 
glass jar and two liters of pure 
alcohol from the local druggist 
and drowned the animal in the 
liquid. Unfortunately he left the 
specimen in the small Italian 
town. But he remembered that it 
was 20 inches long, which is at 
least twice the length of any 
other lizard known to occur in 
that region. 

Well? So? Nobody knows. As 
in many other places in science, 
the motto which applies is "wait 
and see." 

I'm afraid the same is true of 
the letter section of this department. I've used up all my room, 
so the questions from readers will 
have to wait until next month. 
Sorry.

THE BIG TRIP 

UP YONDER 



By KURT VONNEGUT, JR. 

Illustrated by KOSSIN 

If it was good enough for your grandfather, forget it . . . it is 
much too good for anyone else! 



G RAMPS FORD, his chin 
resting on his hands, his 
hands on the crook of his 
cane, was staring irascibly at the 
five-foot television screen that 
dominated the room. On the 
screen, a news commentator was 
summarizing the day's happenings. Every thirty seconds or so, 
Gramps would jab the floor with 
his canetip and shout, "Hell, we 



did that a hundred years ago!" 

Emerald and Lou, coming in 
from the balcony, where they had 
been seeking that 2185 A.D. rarity 
— privacy — were obliged to take 
seats in the back row, behind 
Lou's father and mother, brother 
and sister-in-law, son and daughter-in-law, grandson and wife, 
granddaughter and husband, 
great-grandson and wife, nephew 



100 




 



and wife, grandnephew and wife, 
great-grandniece and husband, 
great-grandnephew and wife — 
and, of course, Gramps, who was 
in front of everybody. All save 
Gramps, who was somewhat 
withered and bent, seemed, by 
pre-anti-gerasone standards, to 
be about the same age — somewhere in their late twenties or 
early thirties. Gramps looked older because he had already reached 
70 when anti-gerasone was invented. He had not aged in the 
102 years since. 

"Meanwhile," the commentator was saying, "Council Bluffs, 
Iowa, was still threatened by 
stark tragedy. But 200 weary 
rescue workers have refused to 
give up hope, and continue to 
dig in an effort to save Elbert 
Haggedorn, 183, who has been 
wedged for two days in a . . ." 

"I wish he'd get something 
more cheerful," Emerald whispered to Lou. 

SILENCE!" cried Gramps. 
"Next one shoots off his big 
bazoo while the TV's on is gonna 
find hisself cut off without a dollar — " his voice suddenly softened and sweetened — "when they 
wave that checkered flag at the 
Indianapolis Speedway, and old 
Gramps gets ready for the Big 
Trip Up Yonder." 

He sniffed sentimentally, while 
his heirs concentrated desperate


ly on not making the slightest 
sound. For them, the poignancy 
of the prospective Big Trip had 
been dulled somewhat, through 
having been mentioned by 
Gramps about once a day for 
fifty years. 

"Dr. Brainard Keyes Bullard," 
continued the commentator, 
"President of Wyandotte College, 
said in an address tonight that 
most of the world's ills can be 
traced to the fact that Man's 
knowledge of himself has not 
kept pace with his knowledge of 
the physical world." 

"Hell!" snorted Gramps. "We 
said that a hundred years ago!" 

"In Chicago tonight," the commentator went on, "a special 
celebration is taking place in the 
Chicago Lying-in Hospital. The 
guest of honor is Lowell W. Hitz, 
age zero. Hitz, born this morning, 
is the twenty-five-millionth child 
to be born in the hospital." The 
commentator faded, and was replaced on the screen by young 
Hitz, who squalled furiously. 

"Hell!" whispered Lou to 
Emerald. "We said that a hundred years ago." 

"I heard that!" shouted 
Gramps. He snapped off the television set and his petrified descendants stared silently at the 
screen. "You, there, boy — " 

"I didn't mean anything by it, 
sir," said Lou, aged 103. 

"Get me my will. You know 



THE BIG TRIP UP YONDER 



101 



where it is. You kids all know 
where it is. Fetch, boy!" Gramps 
snapped his gnarled fingers 
sharply. 

Lou nodded dully and found 
himself going down the hall, 
picking his way over bedding to 
Gramps' room, the only private 
room in the Ford apartment. 
The other rooms were the bathroom, the living room and the 
wide windowless hallway, which 
was originally intended to serve 
as a dining area, and which had 
a kitchenette in one end. Six 
mattresses and four sleeping bags 
were dispersed in the hallway and 
living room, and the daybed, in 
the living room, accommodated 
the eleventh couple, the favorites 
of the moment. 

On Gramps' bureau was his 
will, smeared, dog-eared, perforated and blotched with hundreds of additions, deletions, accusations, conditions, warnings, 
advice and homely philosophy. 
The document was, Lou reflected, 
a fifty-year diary, all jammed 
onto two sheets — a garbled, illegible log of day after day of 
strife. This day, Lou would be 
disinherited for the eleventh time, 
and it would take him perhaps six 
months of impeccable behavior 
to regain the promise of a share 
in the estate. To say nothing of' 
the daybed in the living room for 
Em and himself. 

"Boy!" called Gramps. 



"Coming, sir."- Lou hurried 
back into the living room and 
handed Gramps the will. 

"Pen!" said Gramps. 

TTE was instantly offered eleven 
pens, one from each couple. 
"Not that leaky thing," he said, 
brushing Lou's pen aside. "Ah, 
there's a nice one. Good boy, 
Willy." He accepted Willy's pen. 
That was the tip they had all 
been waiting for. Willy, then — 
Lou's father — was the new favorite. 

Willy, who looked almost as 
young as Lou, though he was 142, 
did a poor job of concealing his 
pleasure. He glanced shyly at the 
daybed, which would become his, 
and from which Lou and Emerald would have to move back 
into the hall, back to the worst 
spot of all by the bathroom door. 

Gramps missed none of the 
high drama he had authored and 
he gave his own familiar role 
everything he had. Frowning and 
running his finger along each line, 
as though he were seeing the 
will for the first time, he read 
aloud in a deep portentous monotone, like a bass note on a cathedral organ. 

"I, Harold D. Ford, residing 
in Building 257 of Alden Village, 
New York City, Connecticut, do 
hereby make, publish and declare 
this to be my last Will and Testament, revoking any and all form


102 




 



er wills and codicils by me at 
any time heretofore made." He 
blew his nose importantly and 
went on, not missing a word, and 
repeating many for emphasis — 
repeating in particular his evermore-elaborate specifications for 
a funeral. 

At the end of these specifications, Gramps was so choked 
with emotion that Lou thought 
he might have forgotten why he'd 
brought out the will in the first 
place. But Gramps heroically 
brought his powerful emotions 
under control and, after erasing 
for a full minute, began to write 
and speak at the same time. Lou 
could have spoken his lines for 
him, he had heard them so often. 

"I have had many heartbreaks 
ere leaving this vale of tears for 
a better land," Gramps said and 
wrote. "But the deepest hurt of 
all has been dealt me by — " He 
looked around the group, trying 
to remember who the malefactor 
was. 

Everyone looked helpfully at 
Lou, who held up his hand resignedly. 

Gramps nodded, remembering, 
and completed the sentence — "my 
great-grandson, Louis J. Ford." 

"Graridson, sir," said Lou. 

"Don't quibble. You're in deep 
enough now, young man," said 
Gramps, but he made the change. 
And, from there, he went without 
a misstep through the phrasing of 



the disinheritance, causes for 
which were disrespectfulness and 
quibbling. 

IN the paragraph following, the 
-r- paragraph that had belonged 
to everyone in the room at one 
time or another, Lou's name was 
scratched out and Willy's substituted as heir to the apartment 
and, the biggest plum of all, the 
double bed in the private bedroom. 

"So!" said Gramps, beaming. 
He erased the date at the foot of 
the will and substituted a new 
one, including the time of day. 
"Well — time to watch the McGarvey Family." The McGarvey 
Family was a television serial 
that Gramps had been following 
since he was 60, or for a total of 
112 years. "I can't wait to see 
what's going to happen next," 
he said. 

Lou detached himself from the 
group and lay down on his bed 
of pain by the bathroom door. 
Wishing Em would join him, he 
wondered where she was. 

He dozed for a few moments, 
until he was disturbed by someone stepping over him to get into 
the bathroom. A moment later, he 
heard a faint gurgling sound, as 
though something were being 
poured down the washbasin 
drain. Suddenly, it entered his 
mind that Em had cracked up, 
that she was in there doing some


104 




 



thing drastic about Gramps. 

"Em?" he whispered through 
the panel. There was no reply, 
and Lou pressed against the door. 
The worn lock, whose bolt barely 
engaged its socket, held for a 
second, then let the door swing 
inward. 

"Morty!" gasped Lou. 

Lou's great-grandnephew, Mortimer, who had just married and 
brought his wife home to the 
Ford menage, looked at Lou with 
consternation and surprise. Morty 
kicked the door shut, but not before Lou had glimpsed what was 
in his hand — Gramps' enormous 
economy-size bottle of antigerasone, which had apparently 
been half -emptied, and which 
Morty was refilling with tap 
water. 

A moment later, Morty came 
out, glared defiantly at Lou and 
brushed past him wordlessly to 
rejoin his pretty bride. 

Shocked, Lou didn't know 
what to do. He couldn't let 
Gramps take the mousetrapped 
anti-gerasone — but, if he warned 
Gramps about it, Gramps would 
certainly make life in the apartment, which was merely insufferable now, harrowing. 

Lou glanced into the living 
room and saw that the Fords, 
Emerald among them, were momentarily at rest, relishing the 
botches that the McGarveys had 
- made of their lives. Stealthily, he 



went into the bathroom, locked 
the door as well as he could 
and began to pour the contents 
of Gramps' bottle down the drain. 
He was gcing to refill it with 
full-strength anti-gerasone from 
the 22 smaller bottles on the 
shelf. 

The bottle contained a halfgallon, and its neck was small, 
so it seemed to Lou that the 
emptying would take forever. 
And the almost imperceptible 
smell of anti-gerasone, like 
Worcestershire sauce, now seemed 
to Lou, in his nervousness, to be 
pouring out into the rest of the 
apartment, through the keyhole 
and under the door. 

7T1HE bottle gurgled monoton-■• ously. Suddenly, up came the 
sound of music from the living 
room and there were murmurs 
and the scraping of chairlegs on 
the floor. "Thus ends," said the 
television announcer, "the 29,121st chapter in the life of your 
neighbors and mine, the McGarveys." Footsteps were coming 
down the hall. There was a knock 
on the bathroom door. 

"Just a sec," Lou cheerily called out. Desperately, he shook the 
big bottle, trying to speed up 
the flow. His palms slipped on 
the wet glass, and the heavy 
bottle smashed on the tile floor. 

The door was pushed open, 
and Gramps, dumbfounded, star

ed at the incriminating mess. 

Lou felt a hideous prickling 
sensation on his scalp and the 
back of his neck. He grinned 
engagingly through his nausea 
and, for want of anything remotely resembling a thought, 
waited for Gramps to speak. 

"Well, boy," said Gramps at 
last, "looks like you've got a 
little tidying up to do." 

And that was all he said. He 
turned around, elbowed his way 
through the crowd and locked 
himself in his bedroom. 

The Fords contemplated Lou 
in incredulous silence a moment 
longer, and then hurried back to 
the living room, as though some 
of his horrible guilt would taint 
them, too, if they looked too 
long. Morty stayed behind long 
enough to give Lou a quizzical, 
annoyed glance. Then he also 
went into the living room, leaving only Emerald standing in the 
doorway. 

Tears streamed over her 
cheeks. "Oh, you poor lamb — 
please don't look so awful! It 
was my fault. I put you up to 
this with my nagging about 
Gramps." 

"No," said Lou, finding his 
voice, "really you didn't. Honest, 
Em, I was just — " 

"You don't have to explain 
anything to me, hon. I'm on your 
side, no matter what." She kissed 
him on one cheek and whispered 



in his ear, "It wouldn't have been 
murder, hon. It wouldn't have 
killed him. It wasn't such a terrible thing to do. It just would 
have fixed him up so he'd be 
able to go any time God decided 
He wanted him." 

"What's going to happen next, 
Em?" said Lou hollowly. "What's 
he going to do?" 

¥ OU and Emerald stayed fear" fully awake almost all night, 
waiting to see what Gramps was 
going to do. But not a sound 
came from the sacred bedroom. 
Two hours before dawn, they 
finally dropped off to sleep. 

At six o'clock, they arose again, 
for it was time for their generation to eat breakfast in the kitchenette. No one spoke to them. 
They had twenty minutes in 
which to eat, but their reflexes 
were so dulled by the bad night 
that they had hardly swallowed 
two mouthfuls of egg-type processed seaweed before it was time 
to surrender their places to their 
son's generation. 

Then, as was the custom for 
whoever had been most recently 
disinherited, they began preparing Gramps' breakfast, which 
would presently be served to him 
in bed, on a tray. They tried to 
be cheerful about it. The toughest part of the job was having 
to handle the honest-to-God eggs 
and bacon and oleomargarine, 



106 




 



on which Gramps spent so much 
of the income from his fortune. 

"Well," said Emerald, "I'm not 
going to get all panicky until I'm 
sure there's something to be panicky about." 

"Maybe he doesn't know what 
it was I busted," Lou said hopefully. 

"Probably thinks it was your 
watch crystal," offered Eddie, 
their son, who was toying apathetically with his buckwheattype processed sawdust cakes. 

"Don't get sarcastic with your 
father," said Em, "and don't talk 
with your mouth full, either." 

"I'd like to see anybody take 
a mouthful of this stuff and not 
say something," complained Eddie, who was 73. He glanced at 
the clock. "It's time to take 
Gramps his breakfast, you 
know." 

"Yeah, it is, isn't it?" said Lou 
weakly. He shrugged. "Let's have 
the tray, Em." 

"We'll both go." 

Walking slowly, smiling bravely, they found a large semi-circle 
of long-faced Fords standing 
around the bedroom door. 

Em knocked. "Gramps," she 
called brightly, "break-fast is 
rea-dy." 

There was no reply and she 
knocked again, harder. 

The door swung open before 
her fist. In the middle of the 
room, the soft, deep, wide, cano


pied bed, the symbol of the sweet 
by-and-by to every Ford, was 
empty. 

A sense of death, as unfamiliar 
to the Fords as Zoroastrianism or 
the causes of the Sepoy Mutiny, 
stilled every voice, slowed every 
heart. Awed, the heirs began to 
search gingerly, under the furniture and behind the drapes, for 
all that was mortal of Gramps, 
father of the clan. 

¥>UT Gramps had left not his 
" Earthly husk but a note, 
which Lou finally found on the 
dresser, under a paperweight 
which was a treasured souvenir 
from the World's Fair of 2000. 
Unsteadily, Lou read it aloud: 

" 'Somebody who I have sheltered and protected and taught 
the best I know how all these 
years last night turned on me 
like a mad dog and diluted my 
anti-gerasone, or tried to. I am no 
longer a young man. I can no 
longer bear the crushing burden 
of life as I once could. So, after 
last night's bitter experience, I 
say good-by. The cares of this 
world will soon drop away like 
a cloak of thorns and I shall 
know peace. By the time you find 
this, I will be gone.' " 

"Gosh," said Willy brokenly, 
"he didn't even get to see how 
the 5000-mile Speedway Race 
was going to come out." 

"Or the Solar Series," Eddie 



THE BIG TRIP UP YONDER 



107 



said, with large mournful eyes. 

"Or whether Mrs. McGarvey 
got her eyesight back," added 
Morty. 

"There's more," said Lou, and 
he began reading aloud again: 
" % Harold D. Ford, etc., do 
hereby make, publish and declare 
this to be my last Will and Testament, revoking any and all former wills and codicils by me at 
any time heretofore made.' " 

"No!" cried Willy. "Not another one!" 

"'I do stipulate,'" read Lou, 
" 'that all of my property, of 
whatsoever kind and nature, not 
be divided, but do devise and bequeath it to be held in common 
by my issue, without regard for 
generation, equally, share and 
share alike.' " 

"Issue?" said Emerald. 

Lou included the multitude in 
a sweep of his hand. "It means 
we all own the whole damn 
shootin' match." 

Each eye turned instantly to 
the bed. 

"Share and share alike?" asked 
Morty. 

"Actually," said Willy, who 
was the oldest one present, "it's 
just like the old system, where 
the oldest people head up things 
with their headquarters in here 
and—" 

"I like that\" exclaimed Em. 
"Lou owns as much of it as you 
do, and I say it ought to be for 



the oldest one who's still working. You can snooze around here 
all day, waiting for your pension 
check, while poor Lou stumbles 
in here after work, all tuckered 
out, and — " 

"How about letting somebody 
who's never had any privacy get 
a little crack at it?" Eddie demanded hotly. "Hell, you old 
people had plenty of privacy 
back when you were kids. I was 
born and raised in the middle of 
that goddamn barracks in the 
hall! How about—" 

"Yeah?" challenged Morty. 
"Sure, you've all had it pretty 
tough, and my heart bleeds for 
you. But try honeymooning in 
the hall for a real kick." 

"Silence!" shouted Willy imperiously. "The next person who 
opens his mouth spends the next 
sixth months by the bathroom. 
Now clear out of my room. I 
want to think." 

A vase shattered against the 
wall, inches above his head. 

TN the next moment, a freefor-all was under way, with 
each couple battling to eject 
every other couple from the room. 
Fighting coalitions formed and 
dissolved with the lightning 
changes of the tactical situation. 
Em and Lou were thrown into 
the hall, where they organized 
others in the same situation, and 
stormed back into the room. 



108 




 



After two hours of struggle, 
with nothing like a decision in 
sight, the cops broke in, followed 
by television cameramen from 
mobile units. 

For the next half -hour, patrol 
wagons and ambulances hauled 
away Fords, and then the apartment was still and spacious, 

An hour later, films of the last 
stages of the riot were being televised to 500,000,000 delighted 
viewers on the Eastern Seaboard. 

In the stillness of the threeroom Ford apartment on the 76th 
floor of Building 257, the television set had been left on. Once 
more the air was filled with the 
cries and grunts and crashes of 
the fray, coming harmlessly now 
from the loudspeaker. 

The battle also appeared on 
the screen of the television set in 
the police station, where the 
Fords and their captors watched 
with professional interest. 

Em and Lou, in adjacent fourby-eight cells, were stretched out 
peacefully on their cots. 

"Em," called Lou through the 
partition, "you got a washbasin 
all your own, too?" 

"Sure. Washbasin, bed, light — 
the works. And we thought 
Gramps' room was something. 
How long has this been going 
on?" She held out her hand. 
"For the first time in forty years, 
hon, I haven't got the shakes — 
look at me!" 



"Cross your fingers," said Lou. 
"The lawyer's going to try to 
get us a year." 

"Gee!" Em said dreamily. "I 
wonder what kind of wires you'd 
have to pull to get put away in 
solitary?" 

"All right, pipe down," said 
the turnkey, "or I'll toss the 
whole kit and caboodle of you 
right out. And first one who lets 
on to anybody outside how good 
jail is ain't never getting back 
in!" 

The prisoners instantly fell 
silent. 

PT^HE living room of the apart ment darkened for a moment 
as the riot scenes faded on the 
television screen, and then the 
face of the announcer appeared, 
like the Sun coming from behind 
a cloud. "And now, friends," he 
said, "I have a special message 
from the makers of anti-gerasone, 
a message for all you folks over 
150. Are you hampered socially 
by wrinkles, by stiffness of joints 
and discoloration or loss of hair, 
all because these things came 
upon you before anti-gerasone 
was developed? Well, if you are, 
you need no longer suffer, need 
no longer feel different and out 
of things. 

"After years of research, medical science has now developed 
Super-anti-gerasone! In weeks — 
yes, weeks — you can look, feel 



THE BIG TRIP UP YONDER 



109 



and act as young as your greatgreat-grandchildren! Wouldn't 
you pay $5,000 to be indistinguishable from everybody else? 
Well, you don't have to. Safe, 
tested Super-anti-gerasone costs 
you only a few dollars a day. 

"Write now for your free trial 
carton. Just put your name and 
address on a dollar postcard, and 
mail it to 'Super,' Box 500,000, 
Schenectady, N. Y. Have you got 
that? I'll repeat it. 'Super,' Box 
500,000 . . ." 

Underlining the announcer's 
words was the scratching of 
Gramps' pen, the one Willy had 
given him the night before. He 
had come in, a few minutes 
earlier, from the Idle Hour Tavern, which commanded a view of 
Building 257 from across the 
square of asphalt known as the 
Alden Village Green. He had 
called a cleaning woman to come 
straighten the place up, then had 
hired the best lawyer in town to 



get his descendants a conviction, 
a genius who had never gotten a 
client less than a year and a day. 
Gramps had then moved the daybed before the television screen, 
so that he could watch from a 
reclining position. It was something he'd dreamed of doing for 
years. 

"Schen-ec-ta-dy," murmured 
Gramps. "Got it!" His face had 
changed remarkably. His facial 
muscles seemed to have relaxed, 
revealing kindness and equanimity under what had been taut 
lines of bad temper. It was almost as though his trial package 
of Super-anti-gerasone had already arrived. When something 
amused him on television, he 
smiled easily, rather than barely 
managing to lengthen the thin 
line of his mouth a millimeter. 

Life was good. He could hardly 
wait to see what was going to 
happen next.

The holes 
around Mars 



By JEROME BIXBY 

Science said it could not be, 
but there it was. And whoosh 
— look out — here it is again! 



SPACESHIP crews should 
be selected on the basis of 
their non-irritating qualities as individuals. No chronic 
complainers, no hypochondriacs, 
no bugs on cleanliness — particularly no one-man parties. I speak 
from bitter experience. 

Because on the first expedition 
to Mars, Hugh Allenby damned 



Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



near drove us nuts with his puns. 
We finally got so we just ignored 
them. 

But no one can ignore that 
classic last one — it's written right 
into the annals of astronomy, 
and it's there to stay. 

Allenby, in command of the 
expedition, was first to set foot 
outside the ship. As he stepped 



THE HOLES AROUND MARS 



111 



down from the airlock of the 
Mars I. he placed that foot on a 
convenient rock, caught the toe 
of his weighted boot in a hole in 
the rock, wrenched his ankle and 
smoti the ground with his pants. 

Sitting there, eyes pained behind the transparent shield of his 
oxygen-mask, he stared at the 
rock. 

TT was about five feet high. Or■*■ dinary granite — no special 
shape — and several inches below 
its summit, running straight 
through it in a northeasterly direction, was a neat round fourinch hole. 

"I'm upset by the hole thing," 
he grunted. 

The rest of us scrambled out 
of the ship and gathered around 
his plump form. Only one or two 
of us winced at his miserable 
double pun. 

"Break anything, Hugh?" asked Burton, our pilot, kneeling 
beside him. 

"Get out of my way, Burton," 
said Allenby. "You're obstructing my view." 

Burton blinked. A man constructed of long bones and caution, he angled out of the way, 
looking around to see what he 
was obstructing view of. 

He saw the rock and the round 
hole through it. He stood very 
still, staring. So did the rest of 
us. 



"Well, I'll be damned," said 
Janus, our photographer. "A 
hole." 

"In a rock," added Gonzales, 
our botanist. 

"Round," said Randolph, our 
biologist. 

"An artifact," finished Allenby 
softly. 

Burton helped him to his feet. 
Silently we gathered around the 
rock. 

Janus bent down and put an 
eye to one end of the hole. I 
bent down and looked through 
the other end. We squinted at 
each other. 

As mineralogist, I was expected to opinionate. "Not drilled," 
I said slowly. "Not chipped. Not 
melted. Certainly not eroded." 

I heard a rasping sound by my 
ear and straightened. Burton was 
scratching a thumbnail along the 
rim of the hole. "Weathered," he 
said. "Plenty old. But I'll bet it's 
a perfect circle, if we measure." 

Janus was already fiddling with 
his camera, testing the cooperation of the tiny distant sun with 
a light-meter. 

"Let us see weather it is or not," 
Allenby said. 

DURTON brought out a steel 
tape-measure. The hole was 
four and three-eighths inches 
across. It was perfectly circular 
and about sixteen inches long. 
And four feet above the ground. 



112 




 



"But why?" said Randolph. 
"Why should anyone bore a fourinch tunnel through a rock way 
out in the middle of the desert?" 

"Religious symbol," said Janus. He looked around, one hand 
on his gun. "We'd better keep an 
eye out — maybe we've landed on 
sacred ground or something." 

"A totem hole, perhaps," Allenby suggested. 

"Oh, I don't know," Randolph 
said — to Janus, not Allenby. As 
I've mentioned, we always ignored Allenby's puns. "Note the 
lack of ornamentation. Not at all 
typical of religious articles." 

"On Earth," Gonzales reminded him. "Besides, it might be 
utilitarian, not symbolic." 

"Utilitarian, how?" asked Janus. 

"An altar for snakes," Burton 
said dryly. # 

"Well," said Allenby, "you 
can't deny that it has its holy 
aspects." 

"Get your hand away, will you, 
Peters?" asked Janus. 

I did. When Janus's camera 
had clicked, I bent again and 
peered through the hole. "It sights 
on that low ridge over there," I 
said. "Maybe it's some kind of 
surveying setup. I'm going to 
take a look." 

"Careful," warned Janus. "Remember, it may be sacred." 

As I walked away, I heard Allenby say, "Take some scrapings 



from the inside of the hole, Gonzales. We might be able to determine if anything is kept in 
it. . ." 

One of the stumpy, purplish, 
barrel-type cacti on the ridge 
had a long vertical bite out of it 
. . . as if someone had carefully 
carved out a narrow U-shaped 
section from the top down, finishing the bottom of the U in a 
neat semicircle. It was as flat 
and cleancut as the inside surface of a horseshoe magnet. 

I hollered. The others came 
running. I pointed. 

"Oh, my God!" said Allenby. 
"Another one." 

The pulp of the cactus in and 
around the U-hole was dried and 
dead-looking. 

Silently Burton used his tapemeasure. The hole measured four 
and three-eighths inches across. 
It was eleven inches deep. The 
semicircular bottom was about a 
foot above the gr/ound. 

"This ridge," I said, "is about 
three feet higher than where we 
landed the ship. I bet the hole 
in the rock and the hole in this 
cactus are on the same level." 

ONZALES said slowly, "This 
was not done all at once. 
It is a result of periodic attacks. 
Look here and here. These overlapping depressions along the 
outer edges of the^ hole — " he 
pointed — "on this side of the 



THE HOLES AROUND MARS 



113 



cactus. They are the signs of 
repeated impact. And the scallop 
effect on this side, where whatever made the hole emerged. 
There are juices still oozing — 
not at the point of impact, where 
the plant is desiccated, but below, 
where the shock was transmitted—" 

A distant shout turned us 
around. Burton was at the rock, 
beside the ship. He was bending 
down, his eye to the far side of 



the mysterious hole. 

He looked for another second, 
then straightened and came toward us at a lope. 

"They line up," he said when 
he reached us. "The bottom of . 
the hole in the cactus is right 
in the middle when you sight 
through the hole in the rock." 

"As if somebody came around 
and whacked the cactus regularly/' Janus said, looking around 
warily. 




114 




 



"To keep the line of sight 
through the holes clear?" I wondered. "Why not just remove 
the cactus?" 

"Religious," Janus explained. 

The gauntlet he had discarded 
lay ignored on the ground, in 
the shadow of the cactus. We 
went on past the ridge toward an 
outcropping of rock about a hundred yards farther on. We walked silently, each of us wondering 
if what we half-expected would 



really be there. 

It was. In one of the tall, weathered spires in the outcropping, 
some ten feet below its peak and 
four feet above the ground, was 
a round four-inch hole. 

Allenby sat down on a rock, 
nursing his ankle, and remarked 
that anybody who believed this 
crazy business was really happening must have holes in the 
rocks in his head. 

Burton put his eye to the hole 




THE HOLES AROUND MARS 



115 



and whistled. "Sixty feet long 
if it's an inch," he said. "The 
other end's just a pinpoint. But 
you can see it. The damn thing's 
perfectly straight." 

I looked back the way we had 
come. The cactus stood on the 
ridge, with its U-shaped bite, 
and beyond was the ship, and 
beside it the perforated rock. 

"If we . surveyed," I said, "I 
bet the holes would all line up 
right to the last millimeter." 

"But," Randolph complained, 
"why would anybody go out and 
bore holes in things all along a 
line through the desert?" 

"Religious," Janus muttered. 
"It doesn't have to make sense." 

WE stood there by the outcropping and looked out 
along the wide, red desert beyond. It stretched flatly for miles 
from this point, south toward 
Mars' equator — dead sandy 
wastes, crisscrossed by the "canals," which we had observed 
while landing to be great straggly 
patches of vegetation, probably 
strung along underground waterflows. 

BLONG-G-G-G- . . . st sr-sr - . . . 

We jumped half out of our 
skins. Ozone bit at our nostrils. 
Our hair stirred in the electrical 
uproar. 

"L - look," Janus chattered, 
lowering his smoking gun. 



About forty feet to our left, a 
small rabbity creature poked its 
head from behind a rock and 
stared at us in utter horror. 

Janus raised his gun again. 

"Don't bother," said Allenby 
tiredly. "I don't think it intends 
to attack." 

"But—" 

"I'm sure it isn't a Martian 
with religious convictions." 

Janus wet his lips and looked 
a little shamefaced. "I guess I'm 
kind of taut." 

"That's what I taut," said Allenby. 

The creature darted from behind its rock and, looking at us 
over its shoulder, employed six 
legs to make small but very 
fast tracks. 

We turned our attention again 
to the desert. Far out, black 
against Mars' azure horizon, was 
a line of low hills. 

"Shall we go look?" asked 
Burton, eyes gleaming at the mystery. 

Janus hefted his gun nervously. It was still crackling faintly 
from the discharge. "I say let's 
get back to the ship!" 

Allenby sighed. "My leg 
hurts." He studied the hills. 
"Give me the field-glasses." 

Randolph handed them over. 
Allenby put them to the shield of 
his mask and adjusted them. 

After a moment he sighed 
again. "There's a hole. On a 



116 




 



plane surface that catches the 
Sun. A lousy damned round little 
impossible hole." 

"Those hills," Burton observed, "must be thousands of feet 
thick." 

'T'HE argument lasted all the 
way back to the ship. 

Janus, holding out for his belief that the whole thing was of 
religious origin, kept looking 
around for Martians as if he expected them to pour screaming 
from the hills. 

Burton came up with the suggestion that perhaps the holes 
had been made by a disintegrator-ray. 

"It's possible," Allenby admitted. "This might have been the 
scene of some great battle — " 

"With only one such weapon?" 
I objected. 

Allenby swore as he stumbled. 
"What do you mean?" 

"I haven't seen any other lines 
of holes — only the one. In a battle, the whole joint should be cut 
up. 

That was good for a few moments' silent thought. Then Allenby said, "It might have been 
brought out by one side as a last 
resort. Sort of an ace in the hole." 

I resisted the temptation to 
mutiny. "But would even one 
such weapon, in battle make 
only one line of holes? Wouldn't 
it be played in an arc against the 



enemy? You know it would." 
"W«U— *' 

"Wouldn't it cut slices out of 
the landscape, instead of boring 
holes? And wouldn't it sway or 
vibrate enough to make the holes 
miles away from it something 
less than perfect circles?" 

"It could have been very firmly mounted." 

"Hugh, does that sound like a 
practical weapon to you?" 

Two seconds of silence. "On 
the other hand," he said, "instead 
of a war, the whole thing might 
have been designed to frighten 
some primitive race — or even 
some kind of beast — the hole out 
of here. A demonstration — " 

"Religious," Janus grumbled, 
still looking around. 

We walked on, passing the cactus on the low ridge. 

"Interesting," said Gonzales. 
"The evidence that whatever 
causes the phenomenon has happened again and again. I'm 
afraid that the war theory — " 

"Oh, my God!" gasped Burton. 

We stared at him. 

"The ship," he whispered. "It's 
right in line with the holes! If 
whatever made them is still in 
operation. . ." 

"Run!" yelled Allenby, and we 
ran like fiends. 

WE got the ship into the air, 
out of line with the holes 
to what we fervently hoped was 



THE HOLES AROUND MARS 



117 



safety, and then we realized we 
were admitting our fear that the 
mysterious hole-maker might still 
be lurking around. 

Well, the evidence was all for 
it, as Gonzales had reminded 
us — that cactus had been oozing. 

We cruised at twenty thousand 
feet and thought it over. 

Janus, whose only training was 
in photography, said, "Some 
kind of omnivorous animal? Or 
bird? Eats rocks and everything?" 

"I will not totally discount the 
notion of such an animal," Randolph said. "But I will resist to 
the death the suggestion that it 
forages with geometric precision." 

After a while, Allenby said, 
"Land, Burton. By that 'canal.' 
Lots of plant life — fauna, too. 
We'll do a little collecting." 

Burton set us down featherlight at the very edge of the 
sprawling flat expanse of vegetation, commenting that the scene 
reminded him of his native Texas 
pear -flats. 

We wandered in the chilly air, 
each of us except Burton pursuing his specialty. Randolph relentlessly stalked another of the 
rabbity creatures. Gonzales was 
carefully digging up plants and 
stowing them in jars. Janus 
was busy with his cameras, recording every aspect of Mars 
transferable to film. Allenby 



walked around, helping anybody 
who needed it. An astronomer, 
he'd done half his work on the 
way to Mars and would do the 
other half on the return trip. 
Burton lounged in the Sun, his 
back against a ship's fin, and 
played chess with Allenby, who 
was calling out his moves in a 
bull roar. I grubbed for rocks. 

My search took me farther and 
farther away from the others — 
all I could find around the 'canal' 
was gravel, and I wanted to chip 
at some big stuff. I walked toward a long rise a half-mile or 
so away, beyond which rose an 
enticing array of house-sized 
boulders. 

As I moved out of earshot, I 
heard Randolph snarl, "Burton, 
will you stop yelling, "Kt to B-2 
and check?' Every time you open 
your yap, this Gritter takes off on 
me." 

Then I saw the groove. 

TT started right where the 
ground began to rise — a thin, 
shallow, curve-bottomed groove 
in the dirt at my feet, about half 
an inch across, running off 
straight toward higher ground. 

With my eyes glued to it, I 
walked. The ground slowly rose. 
The groove deepened, widened — 
now it was about three inches 
across, about one and a half 
deep. 

I walked on, holding my 



118 




 



breath. Four inches wide. Two 
inches deep. 

The ground rose some more. 
Four and three-eighths inches 
wide. I didn't have to measure 
it — I knew. 

Now, as the ground rose, the 
edges of the groove began to 
curve inward over the groove. 
They touched. No more groove. 

The ground had risen, the 
grove had stayed level and gone 
underground. 

Except that now it wasn't a 
groove. It was a round tunnel. 

A hole. 

A few paces farther on, I 
thumped the ground with my 
heel where the hole ought to be. 
The dirt crumbled, and there 
was the little dark tunnel, running straight in both directions. 

I walked on, the ground falling 
away gradually again. The entire process was repeated in reverse. A hairline appeared in 
the dirt — widened — became lips 
that drew slowly apart to reveal 
the neat straight four-inch 
groove — which shrank as slowly 
to a shallow line of the ground — 
and vanished. 

I looked ahead of me. There 
was one low ridge of ground 
between me and the enormous 
boulders. A neat four-inch semicircle was bitten out of the very 
top of the ridge. In the housesized boulder directly beyond 
was a four-inch hole. 



A LLENBY winced and called 
the others when I came back 
and reported. 

"The mystery deepens," he 
told them. He turned to me. 
"Lead on, Peters. You're temporary drill leader." 

Thank God he didn't say Fall 
in. 

The holes went straight 
through the nest of boulders — 
there'd be a hole in one and, ten 
or twenty feet farther on in the 
next boulder, another hole. And 
then another, and another — right 
through the nest in a line. About 
thirty holes in all. 

Burton, standing by -the boulder I'd first seen, flashed his 
flashlight into the hole. Randolph, clear on the other side of 
the jumbled nest, eye to hole, 
saw it. 

Straight as a string! 

The ground sloped away on 
the far side of the nest — no holes 
were visible in that direction — 
just miles of desert. So, after 
we'd stared at the holes for a 
while and they didn't go away, 
we headed back for the canal. 

"Is there any possibility," asked Janus, as we walked, "that it 
could be a natural phenomenon?" 

"There are no straight lines 
in nature," Randolph said, a 
little shortly. "That goes for a 
bunch of circles in a straight line. 
And for perfect circles, too." 



THE HOLES AROUND MARS 



119 



"A planet is a circle," objected 
Janus. 

"An oblate spheroid," Allenby 
corrected. 

"A planet's orbit—" 
"An ellipse." 

Janus walked a few steps, 
frowning. Then he said, "I remember reading that there is 
something darned near a perfect 
circle in nature." He paused a 
moment. "Potholes." And he 
looked at me, as mineralogist, 
to corroborate. 

"What kind of potholes?" I 
asked cautiously. "Do you mean 
where part of a limestone deposit 
has dissol — " 

"No. I once read that when a 
glacier passes over a hard rock 
that's lying on some softer rock, 
it grinds the hard rock down into 
the softer, and both of them sort 
of wear down to fit together, and 
it all ends up with a round hole 
in the soft rock." 

"Probably neither stone," I 
told Janus, "would be homogenous. The softer parts would 
abrade faster in the soft stone. 
The end result wouldn't be a 
perfect circle." 

Janus's face fell. 

"Now," I said, "would anyone 
care to define this term 'perfect 
circle' we're throwing around so 
blithely? Because such holes as 
Janus describes are often pretty 
damned round." 

Randolph said, "Well . . ." 



"It is settled, then," Gonzales 
said, a little sarcastically. "Your 
discussion, gentlemen, has established that the long, horizontal 
holes we have found were caused 
by glacial action." 

"Oh, no," Janus argued seriously. "I once read that Mars 
never had any glaciers." 

All of us shuddered. 

TTALF an hour later, we spotted more holes, about a mile 
down the 'canal,' still on a line, 
marching along the desert, 
through cacti, rocks, hills, even 
through one edge of the low vegetation of the 'canal' for thirty 
feet or so. It was the damnedest 
thing to bend down and look 
straight through all that curling, 
twisting growth ... a round tunnel from either end. 

We followed the holes for 
about a mile, to the rim of an 
enormous saucerlike valley that 
sank gradually before us until, 
miles away, it was thousands of 
feet deep. We stared out across it, 
wondering about the other side. 

Allenby said determinedly, 
"We'll burrow to the bottom of 
these holes, once and for all. 
Back to the ship, men!" 

We hiked back, climbed in and 
took off. 

At an altitude of fifty feet, 
Burton lined the nose of the ship 
on the most recent line of holes 
and we flew out over the valley. 



120 




 



On the other side was a range 
of hefty hills. The holes went 
through them. Straight through. 
We would approach one hill — 
Burton would manipulate the 
front viewscreen until we spotted 
the hole — we would pass over 
the hill and spot the other end 
of the hole in the rear screen. 

One hole was two hundred 
and eighty miles long. 

Four hours later, we were halfway around Mars. 

Randolph was sitting by a 
side port, chin on one hand, his 
eyes unbelieving. "All around the 
planet," he kept repeating. "All 
around the planet. . ." 

"Halfway at least," Allenby 
mused. "And we can assume that 
it continues in a straight line, 
through anything and everything 
that gets in its way. . ." He 
gazed out the front port at the 
uneven blue-green haze of a 
'canal' off to our left. "For the 
love of Heaven, why?" 

Then Allenby fell down. We 
all did. 

Burton had suddenly slapped 
at the control board, and the 
ship braked and sank like a 
plugged duck. At the last second, 
Burton propped up the nose with 
a short burst, the ten-foot wheels 
hit desert sand and in five hundred yards we had jounced to a 
stop. 

Allenby got up from the floor. 
"Why did you do that?" he 



asked Burton politely, nursing a 
bruised elbow. 

Burton's nose was almost 
touching the front port. "Look!" 
he said, and pointed. 

About two miles away, the 
Martian village looked like a 
handful of yellow marbles flung 
on the desert. 

WE checked our guns. We put 
on our oxygen-masks. We 
checked our guns again. We got 
out of the ship and made damned 
sure the airlock was locked. 

An hour later, we crawled 
inch by painstaking inch up a 
high sand dune and poked our 
heads over the top. 

The Martians were runts — the 
tallest of them less than five 
feet tall — and skinny as a pencil. 
Dried-up and brown, they wore 
loincloths of woven fiber. 

They stood among the dustylooking inverted-bowl buildings 
of their village, and every one 
of them was looking straight up 
at us with unblinking brown 
eyes. 

The six safeties of our six 
guns clicked off like a rattle of 
dice. The Martians stood there 
and gawped. 

"Probably a highly developed 
sense of hearing in this thin atmosphere," Allenby murmured. 
"Heard us coming." 

"They thought that landing of 
Burton's was an earthquake," 



THE HOLES AROUND MARS 



121 



Randolph grumbled sourly. 

"Marsquake," corrected Janus. 
One look at the village's scrawny 
occupants seemed to have convinced him that his life was in 
no danger. 

Holding the Martians covered, 
we examined the village from 
atop the thirty -foot dune. 

The domelike buildings were 
constructed of something that 
looked like adobe. No windows — 
probably built with sandstorms 
in mind. The doors were about 
halfway up the sloping sides, and 
from each door a stone ramp 
wound down around the house to 
the ground — again with sand- . 
storms in mind, no doubt, so 
drifting dunes wouldn't block 
the entrances. 

The center of the village was 
a wide street, a long sandy 
area some thirty feet wide. On 
either side of it, the houses were 
scattered at random, as if each 
Martian had simply hunted for 
a comfortable place to sit and 
then built a house around it. 

"Look," whispered Randolph. 

One Martian had stepped from 
a group situated on the far side 
of the street from us. He started 
to cross the street, his round 
brown eyes on us, his small bare 
feet plodding sand, and we saw 
that in addition to a loincloth he 
wore jewelry — a hammered 
metal ring, a bracelet on one 
skinny ankle. The Sun caught 

122 



a copperish gleam on his bald 
narrow head, and we saw a band 
of metal there, just above where 
his eyebrows should have been. 

"The super-chief," Allenby 
murmured. "Oh, shaman me!" 

As the bejeweled Martian approached the center of the street, 
he glanced briefly at the ground 
at his feet. Then he raised his 
head, stepped with dignity across 
the exact center of the street 
and came on toward us, passing 
the dusty-looking buildings of 
his realm and the dusty-looking 
groups of his subjects. 

He reached the slope of the 
dune we lay on, paused — and 
raised small hands over his head, 
palms toward us. 

"I think," Allenby said, "that 
an anthropologist would give 
odds on that gesture meaning 
peace." 

He stood up, holstered his 
gun — without buttoning the flap 
— and raised his own hands over 
his head. We all did. 




HE Martian language consisted of squeaks. 



We made friendly noises, the 
chief squeaked and pretty soon 
we were the center of a group 
of wide-eyed Martians, none of 
whom made a sound. Evidently 
no one dared peep while the chief 
spoke — very likely the most articulate Martians simply squeaked themselves into the job. Al

 



lenby, of course, said they just 
squeaked by. 

He was going through the business of drawing concentric circles in the sand, pointing at the 
third orbit away from the Sun 
and thumping his chest. The 
crowd around us kept growing 
as more Martians emerged from 
the dome buildings to see what 
was going on. Down the winding 
ramps of the buildings on our 
side of the wide, sandy street 
they came — and from the buildings on the other side of the 
street, plodding through the 
sand, blinking brown eyes at us, 
not making a sound. 

Allenby pointed at the third 
orbit and thumped his chest. The 
chief squeaked and thumped his 
own chest and pointed at the 
copperish band around his head. 
Then he pointed at Allenby. 

"I eeem to have conveyed to 
him," Allenby said dryly, "the 
fact that I'm chief of our party. 
Well, let's try again." 

He started over on the orbits. 
He didn't seem to be getting anyplace, so the rest of us watched 
the Martians instead. A last 
handful was straggling across the 
wide street. 

"Curious," said Gonzales. 
"Note what happens when they 
reach the center of the street." 

Each Martian, upon reaching 
the center of the street, glanced 
at his feet — just for a moment — 



without even breaking stride. And 
then came on. 

"What can they be looking 
at?" Gonzales wondered. 

"The chief did it too," Burton 
mused. "Remember when he first 
came toward us?" 

We all stared intently at the 
middle of the street. We saw 
absolutely nothing but sand. 

The Martians milled around 
us and watched Allenby and his 
orbits. A Martian child appeared 
from between two buildings 
across the street. On six-inch 
legs, it started across, got halfway, glanced downward — and 
came on. 

"I don't get it," Burton said. 
"What in hell are they looking 
at?" 

The child reached the crowd 
and squeaked a thin, high note. 

A number of things happened 
at once. 

OEVERAL members of the 
^ group around us glanced 
down, and along the edge of the 
crowd nearest the center of the 
street there was a mild stir as 
individuals drifted off to either 
side. Quite casually — nothing at 
all urgent about it. They just 
moved concertedly to get farther 
away from the center of the 
street, not taking their interested 
gaze off us for one second in the 
process. 

Even the chief glanced up from 



THE HOLES AROUND MARS 



123 



Allenby's concentric circles at the 
child's squeak. And Randolph, 
who had been fidgeting uncomfortably and paying very little 
attention to our conversation, decided that he must answer Nature's call. He moved off into the 
dunes surrounding the village. 
Or rather, he started to move. 

The moment he set off across 
the wide street, the little Martian 
chief was in front of him, brown 
eyes wide, hands out before him 
as if to thrust Randolph back. 

Again six safeties clicked. The 
Martians didn't even blink at 
the sudden appearance of our 
guns. Probably the only weapon 
they recognized was a club, or 
maybe a rock. 

"What can the matter be?" 
Randolph said. 

He took another step forward. 
The chief squeaked and stood 
his ground. Randolph had to 
stop or bump into him. Randolph stopped. 

The chief squeaked, looking 
right into the bore of Randolph's 
gun. 

"Hold still," Allenby told Randolph, "till we know what's up." 

Allenby made an interrogative 
sound at the chief. The chief 
squeaked and pointed at the 
ground. We looked. He was 
pointing at his shadow. 

Randolph stirred uncomfortably. 

"Hold still," Allenby warned 



him, and again he made the 
questioning sound. 

The chief pointed up the 
street. Then he pointed down the 
street. He bent to touch his shadow, thumping it with thin fingers. Then he pointed at the wall 
of a house nearby. 

We all looked. 

Straight lines had been painted 
on the curved brick-colored wall, 
up and down and across, to form 
many small squares about four 
inches across. In each square was 
a 'bit of squiggly writing, in 
blackish paint, and a small 
wooden peg jutting out from the 
wall. 

Burton said, "Looks like a 
damn crossword puzzle." 

"Look," said Janus. "In the 
lower right corner — a metal ring 
hanging from one of the pegs." 

A ND that was all we saw on 
the wall. Hundreds of 
squares with figures in them — a 
small peg set in each — and a ring 
hanging on one of the pegs. 

"You know what?" Allenby 
said slowly. "I think it's a calendar! Just a second — thirty 
squares wide by twenty-two 
high — that's six hundred and 
sixty. And that bottom line has 
twenty - six — twenty - seven 
squares. Six hundred and eightyseven squares in all. That's how 
many days there are in the Martian year!" 



124 




 



He looked thoughtfully at the 
metal ring. "I'll bet that ring is 
hanging from the peg in the 
square that represents today. 
They must move it along every 
day, to keep track. . ." 

"What's a calendar got to do 
with my crossing the street?" 
Randolph asked in a pained tone. 

He started to take another 
step. The chief squeaked as if it 
were a matter of desperate, concern that he make us understand. 
Randolph stopped again and 
swore impatiently. 

Allenby made his questioning 
sound again. 

The chief pointed emphatically at his shadow, then at the 
communal calendar — and we 
could see now that he was pointing at the metal ring. 

Burton said slowly, "I think 
he's trying to tell us that this is 
today. And such-and-such a 
time of day. I bet he's using his 
shadow as a sundial." 

"Perhaps," Allenby granted. 

Randolph said, "If this monkey doesn't let me go in another 
minute — " 

The chief squeaked, eyes concerned. 

"Stand still," Allenby ordered. 
"He's trying to warn you of some 
danger." 

The chief pointed down the 
street again and, instead of 
squealing, revealed that there 
was another sound at his com


mand. He said, "Whooooooosh!" 

We all stared at the end of the 
street. 

"VTOTHING! Just the wide av-L ' enue between the houses, 
and the high sand dune down at 
the end of it, from which we had 
first looked upon the village. 

The chief described a large 
circle with one hand, sweeping 
the hand above his head, down to 
his knees, up again, as fast as he 
could. He pursed his monkeylips and said, "Whooooooosh!" 
And made the circle again. 

A Martian emerged from the 
door in the side of a house across 
the avenue and blinked at the 
Sun, as if he had just awakened. 
Then he saw what was going on 
below and blinked again, this 
time in interest. He made his 
way down around the winding 
lamp and started to cross the 
street. 

About halfway, he paused, 
eyed the calendar on the house 
wall, glanced at his shadow. 
Then he got down on his hands 
and knees and crawled across the 
middle of the street. Once past 
the middle, he rose, walked the 
rest of the way to join one of 
the groups and calmly stared at 
us along with the rest of them. 

"They're all crazy," Randolph 
said disgustedly. "I'm going to 
cross that street!" 

"Shut up. So it's a certain time 



THE HOLES AROUND MARS 



125 



of a certain day," Allenby mused. "And from the way the chief 
is acting, he's afraid for you to 
cross the street. And that other 
one just crawled. By God, do you 
know what this might tie in 
with?" 

We were silent for a moment. 
Then Gonzales said, "Of course!" 

And Burton said, "The holes!" 

"Exactly," said Allenby. 
"Maybe whatever made — or 
makes — the holes comes right 
down the center of the street 
here. Maybe that's why they 
built the village this way — to 
make room for — " 

"For what?" Randolph asked 
unhappily, shifting his feet. 

"I don't know," Allenby said. 
He looked thoughtfully at the 
chief. "That circular motion he 
made — could he have been describing something that went 
around and around the planet? 
Something like — oh, no!" Allenby's eyes glazed. "I wouldn't believe it in a million years." 

His gaze went to the far end of 
the street, to the high sand dune 
that rose there. The chief seemed 
to be waiting for something to 
happen. 

"I'm going to crawl," Randolph stated. He got to his hands 
and knees and began to creepacross the center of the avenue. 

The chief let him go. 

The sand dune at the end of 
the street suddenly erupted. A 



forty-foot spout of dust shot 
straight out from the sloping 
side, as if a bullet had emerged. 
Powdered sand hazed the air, 
yellowed it almost the full length 
of the avenue. Grains of sand 
stung the skin and rattled minutely on the houses. 

WhoooSSSHHHHH! 

Randolph dropped flat on his 
belly. He didn't have to continue 
his trip. He had made other arrangements. 

rpHAT night in the ship, while 
-■- we all sat around, still shaking our heads every once in a 
while, Allenby talked with Earth. 
He sat there, wearing the headphones, trying to make himself 
understood above the godawful 
static. 

". . . an exceedingly small 
body," he repeated wearily to his 
unbelieving audience, "about 
four inches in diameter. It travels 
at a mean distance of four feet 
above the surface of the planet, 
at a velocity yet to be calculated. 
Its unique nature results in many 
hitherto unobserved — I might 
say even unimagined — phenomena." He stared blankly in front 
of him for a moment, then delivered the understatement of his 
life. "The discovery may necessitate a re-examination of many 
of our basic postulates in the 
physical sciences." 

The headphones squawked. 



126 




 



Patiently, Allenby assured 
Earth that he was entirely serious, and reiterated the results of 
his observations. I suppose that 
he, an astronomer, was twice as 
flabbergasted as the rest of us. 
On the other hand, perhaps he 
was better equipped to adjust to 
the evidence. 

"Evidently," he said, "when 
the body was formed, it traveled 
at such fantastic velocity as to 
enable it to — " his voice was almost a whisper — "to punch holes 
in things." 

The headphones squawked. 

"In rocks," Allenby said, "in 
mountains, in anything that got 
in its way. And now the holes 
form a large portion of its fixed 
orbit." 

Squawk. 

"Its mass must be on the order 
of—" 
Squawk. 

" — process of making the holes 
slowed it, so that now it travels 
just fast enough — " 

Squawk. 

" — maintain its orbit and pene


, trate occasional objects such 
as—" 
Squawk. 

" — and sand dunes — " 
Squawk. 

"My God, I know it's a mathematical monstrosity," Allenby 
snarled. "I didn't put it there!" 

Squawk. 

Allenby was silent for a moment. Then he said slowly, "A 
name?" 

Squawk. 

"H'm," said Allenby. "Well, 
well." He appeared to brighten 
just a little. "So it's up to me, as 
leader of the expedition, to name 
it?" 

Squawk. 

"Well, well," he said. 

That chop-licking tone was in 
his voice. We'd heard it all too 
often before. We shuddered, 
waiting. 

"Inasmuch as Mars' outermost 
moon is called Deimos, and the 
next Phobos," he said, "I think 
I shall name the third moon of 
Mars — Bottomos."

CHILDHOOD'S END by Arthur

cloth, 35^ paper 

"IT'OR a fascinating, uncomfort■■■ able — and unforgettable — experience, I recommend this 
strange book. Two months ago I 
reviewed Clarke's happy fairy 
tale, Against the Fall of Night, 
which peered into the misty fu


ture to a rebirth of mankind 
after millenia of desuetude. Now 
I want to introduce you to his 
weirdly fatalistic picture of the 
imminent transmogrification of 
Homo sapiens, the children of 
the book's title. It is the far other 
end of the Clarkean gamut — from 
simple A to Z x 10 100 ! 

Just as the United States and 
Russia are about to launch their 
competing spaceships, the Over

lords arrive from some unimaginable star system, making human 
efforts at interplanetary travel 
look like nine cents. The Overlords see to it that peace breaks 
out, standards of living for all 
improve dramatically, comfort 
and security and leisure arrive 
post-haste. But no one knows 
who the Overlords are or what 
they want here on Earth. 

Decades later, one daring 
youth smuggles aboard an Overlord interstellar vessel, knowing 
it probably will be 80 years objective time, though only six 
months subjective, before he returns. However, he insists on going so he can find out what there 
l is to know about the Earth's 
benevolent but autocratic Masters. 

No sooner has he left than a 
completely unprecedented event 
takes place — an event for which 
the Overlords had been sent by 
their Overlords to prepare — and 
when he returns, the world of . 
Men that he knew is utterly and 
forever gone. He becomes the 
Last Man on Earth. 

But this capsule outline of the 
plot cannot even remotely suggest the richness, the variety, the 
maturity and the emotional darkness of this book. I am sure it 
will be compared with some of 
Stapledon's works — unfairly to 
both authors, since resemblances 
are only on the surface and 



Clarke tells a much better story 
than Stapledon ever could. 

But the sense of the Enormous 
— in space, in time, in thought — 
are similar in both writers. And 
while Clarke's pessimism is 
double-barreled in that it has a 
glorious side to it, it nevertheless 
is a pessimism that makes one 
think of Lasr and First Men more 
than once. 

The book is a continuous excitement, a continuous kaleidoscope of the unexpected. That it 
is also sometimes a bit wearing 
because of the enormousness of 
its concepts and their essentially 
beyond-science nature is not surprising, nor is it a basic defect. 
It only makes you put the book 
down once in a while to gasp 
for breath. In all, it is a formidably impressive job.

to date has an idea as old as 
the genre itself, but a sufficiently 
fresh approach to give it high 
merit as a fast-moving scienceadventure-detective story. 

A "man with no past" turns 
up at Oak Ridge and drives its 
secret counterspy organization 
crazy with his seemingly pointless activities. There is a murder 
of a physicist, a fascinating Wo

man of Mystery who was the 
physicist's wife, and a whole 
passel of other tasty ingredients. 

Mixed in with all this is a 
sub-story of an "alien invasion," 
the result of a spaceship wreck 
many thousands of years ago, 
and a fantastic "explanation" of 
the ancient Gilgamesh Epic of a 
hero in search of immortality. As 
the tale progresses, these threads 
are cleverly woven together until 
at the end there is a completely 
logical, though highly surprising, 
unity. 

First rate science fiction thriller, well-written and sharply 
paced — in a field where good 
mystery stories are rare. 

THE END OF THE WORLD 
by Kenneth Heuer. Illustrated by 
Chesley Bonestell. Rinehart and 
Co., Inc., New York, 1953. 220 
pages, $3.00 

TF any of our readers want to 
know how astrologists and 
philosophers in the past, and 
astronomers and physicists today, think the world will end, 
this little book is for them. 

The author has collected a 
miscellany of purely superstitious, pseudo-religious ideas from 
the past concerning world's end, 
and has added a series of chapters on the "scientific" likelihood 
of terrestrial finis being accomplished by comet, Moon, asteroid 



and star collisions, explosion or 
death of the Sun — and atomic 
war, only the last of which he 
deems possible within the foreseeable future. This end he believes is more than likely, through 
explosion of a series of hydrogen 
bombs with secondary radiation 
poisonings of the atmosphere. 

Most of the book is time-passing extrapolation, but the chapter 
on atomic war is a powerful plea 
for peace as the only way of 
avoiding a Man-made "end of 
the world." 

The Bonestell plates, first published in Coronet in July, 1947, 
are fine imaginative drawings 
that really need full color to be 
completely effective. But even in 
black and white they are worth 
having in your collection. 

O KING, LIVE FOREVER by 
Henry Myers. Crown Publishers, 
Inc., New York, 1953. 214 pages, 
$3.00 

TTERE is a queer one. It's not 
science fiction even though it 
is about the "science" of indefinitely prolonging lives. And yet it 
is science fiction, too, even though 
there's hardly a gadget in the 
whole book except railroads, 
which play a moderately macabre part in the plot. 

It's the story of an Anglican 
parson, from the day around 1850 
when at the age of three and a 



130 




 



half he heard a doctor pronounce 
him not long for this world and 
thereupon decided to fool everyone and live long, down through 
the odd period when Darwin and 
his followers were smashing the 
idols of Fundamentalism and the 
archeologists were uncovering the 
library of Ashur-banipall and 
translating the Epic of Gilgamesh 
(strange to hit that ancient item 
twice in one month — see the review of Tucker's book, above) 
with its legends of the long-lived 
Ancients, to the present, when the 
parson hero, thinly disguised as 
"The Old Gentleman," meets up 
with the story's narrator and the 
narrator finally meets up with 
the O.G.'s daughter and marries 
her. (Deep breath, please.) The 
Old Gent, incidentally, is well 
over a hundred, though he looks 
no more than a ruddy fifty-two. 

That's all there is to it, except 
for some rather romantically 
melodramatic plotting about Victorian morals and the "ethics" 
of the Church of England in 
the 19th Century. 

The fascinating thing about the 
book is that it makes you feel 
that its scientific speculations on 
prolonging life are real, immediate, and up to you — you, individually. You can will yourself 
to live longer if you go about it 
the right way! 

I think you'll like this most 
unusual and well-done novel, de


spite its being utterly unlike anything else in modern fantasy. 

AHEAD OF TIME by Henry 
Kuttner. Ballantine Books, New 
York, 1953. 177 pages, $2.00 
cloth, 35^ paper 

HHEN top tales, by one who today is too little seen in the 
science fiction magazines, are 
here set before you in another of 
Ballantine's low-priced originals. 
Of the ten, three appeared during 
the past two years, six between 
1942 and 1948, and one new one. 

There is "Or Else," a gem 
about the man from space who 
tried to persuade a couple of 
Mexican feuders to declare peace 
— with hilarious results. There is 
a fine Hogben tale from 1948 
(only Kuttner aficionados will 
know what a Hogben tale is; 
everyone else will have to read 
"Pile of Trouble" to find out) 
and a chiller named "Shock" that 
has to do with a person from the 
far future and a person from today and what happens when they 
mix it up in today's person's 
apartment. 

Many readers may remember 
the superb "Camouflage," from 
eight years ago, about the human 
"transplant" that defeats an attempt to hijack an atomic pile 
being taken to Callisto, and everyone will want to read the new 
item, "Year Day," which de

Five other fine tales complete 
the roster. One of them, "Home

magazine. 

POCKET ENCYCLOPEDIA 
OF ATOMIC ENERGY by 
Frank Gaynor. Philosophical Library, New York, n.d. 204 pages, 
$7.50 

rpHE publication in this country of Gaynor's encyclopedia, 
first issued in England in 1950, is 
an important service to scientists 
working in the fields of nuclear 
physics, chemistry and engineering, even though it is already 
somewhat out of date. It is not 
a book for the layman, but nevertheless it deserves mention because it is such a valuable contribution to the bibliography on 
atomic energy. , 

Though it is basically British 
in orientation, this is hardly a 
defect. American scientists have 
here a source for British definitions through which their own 
terminology can be coordinated 
with that of their co-workers 
overseas. 

FLIGHT INTO YESTERDAY 
by Charles L. Harness. Bouregy 



and Curl, Inc., New York, 1953. 
256 pages, $2.75 

/^HARLES L. Harness' first 
~* long piece of science fiction 
is so far from being believable 
that one reads it purely as a 
sort of berserk fairy tale, portentous and at the same time 
dull. It is, however, pretty astonishing if only because of the 
cauldronful of ideas and fantasies 
that are mixed up in it. 

The tale tells of Alar the 
Thief, another Man With No 
Past (see the Tucker book reviewed above). He is a member 
of the Society of Thieves in a 
dictator-ridden America of tomorrow; the Society devotes all 
its ill-gotten gains to freeing the 
"slaves" of this new decaying 
civilization. 

A moderately good start — but 
before one has gone much further, one finds oneself mixed up 
with speeds so fast that spaceships return years before they 
have left; colonies on (or "in") 
the Sun, where madmen live for 
20 days each, making "muirium," 
the fuel that makes such cosmic 
speeds possible; a sadist psychologist named Shey whose 
dealings with the heroine are 
more reminiscent of material to 
be found in pornography than in 
science fiction; and, finally, the 
End of Civilization — wham!

BACKLASH 



By WINSTON MARKS 

They were the perfect servants — they were 
willing to do everything for nothing. The 
obvious question is: How much is nothing? 




G 



Illustrated by SIBLEY 

I STILL feel that the ingratiating little runts never j'ntended any harm. They were 
eager to please, a cinch to transact business with, and constantly, 
everlastingly grateful to us for 
giving them asylum. 

Yes, we gave the genuflecting 
little devils asylum. And we were 
glad to have them around at 
first — especially when they presented our women' with a gift to 
surpass all gifts: a custom-built 
domestic servant. 

In a civilization that had made 
such a fetish of personal liberty 
and dignity, you couldn't hire a 
butler or an upstairs maid for less 
than love and money. And since 
love was pretty much rationed 
along the lines of monogamy, domestic service was almost a dead 
occupation. That is, until the 
Ollies came to our planet to stay. 
Eventually I learned to despise 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the spineless little immigrants 
from Sirius, but the first time I 
met one he made me feel foolishly important. I looked at his frail, 
olive-skinned little form, and 
thought, // this is what space has 
to offer in the way of advanced 
life- forms . . . well, we haven't 
done so badly on old Mother 
Earth. 

This one's name was Johnson. 
All of them, the whole fifty-six, 
took the commonest Earth family names they could find, and 
dropped their own name-designations whose slobbering sibilance 
made them difficult for us to 
pronounce and write. It seemed 
strange, their casually wiping out 
their nominal heritage just for 
the sake of our convenience — 
imagine an O'Toole or a Rockefeller or an Adams arriving on 
Sirius IV and no sooner learning 
the local lingo than ' insisting on 
becoming known as Sslyslasciffsoszl ! 

But that was the Ollie. Anything to get along and please us. 
And of course, addressing them 
as Johnson, Smith, Jones, etc., 
did work something of a semantic 
protective coloration and reduce 
some of the barriers to quick adjustment to the aliens. 

JOHNSON — Ollie Johnsonappeared at my third underlevel office a few months after 
the big news of their shipwreck 



landing off the Maine coast. He 
arrived a full fifteen minutes 
ahead of his appointment, and I 
was too curious to stand on the 
dignity of office routine and make 
him wait. 

As he stood in the doorway of 
my office, my first visual impression was of an emaciated adolescent, seasick green, prematurely 
balding. 

He bowed, and bowed again, 
and spent thirty seconds reminding me that it was he who had 
sought the interview, and it was 
he who had the big favors to ask 
— and it was wonderful, gracious, 
generous / who flavored the room 
with the essence of mystery, importance, godliness and overpowering sweetness upon whose 
fragrance little Ollie Johnson had 
come to feast his undeserving 
senses. 

"Sit down, sit down," I told 
him when I had soaked in all the 
celestial flattery I could hold. "I 
love you to pieces, too, but I'm 
curious about this proposition 
you mentioned in your message." 

He eased into the chair as if it 
were much too good for him. He 
was strictly humanoid. His fourand-a-half-foot body was dressed 
in the most conservative Earth 
clothing, quiet colors and cheap 
quality. 

While he swallowed slowly a 
dozen times, getting ready to outrage my illustrious being with 



136 




 



his sordid business proposition, 
his coloring varied from a rather 
insipid gray-green to a rich olive 
— which is why the press instantly had dubbed them Ollies. When 
they got excited and blushed, 
they came close to the color of a 
ripe olive; and this was often. 

/"\LLIE JOHNSON hissed a 
few times, his equivalent of 
throat-clearing, and then lunged 
into his subject at a 90 degree 
tangent : 

"Can it be that your gracious 
agreement to this interview connotes a willingness to traffic with 
us of the inferior ones?" His voice 
was light, almost reedy. 

"If it's legal and there's a buck 
in it, can't see any reason why 
not," I told him. 

"You manufacture and distribute devices, I am told. Wonderful labor-saving mechanisms 
that make life on Earth a constant pleasure." 

I was almost tempted to hire 
him for my public relations staff. 

"We do," I admitted. "Servomechanisms, appliances and gadgets of many kinds for the home, 
office and industry." 

"It is to our everlasting disgrace," he said with humility, 
"that we were unable to salvage 
the means to give your magnificent civilization the worthy gift 
of pur space drive. Had Flussissc 
or Shascinssith survived our long 



journey, it would be possible, but 
— " He bowed his head, as if 
waiting for my wrath at the stale 
news that the only two pdwermechanic scientists on board 
were D.O.A. 

"That was tough," I said. "But 
what's on your mind now?" 

He raised his moist eyes, grateful at my forgiveness. "We who 
survived do possess a skill that 
might help repay the debt which 
we have incurred in intruding 
upon your glorious planet." 

He begged my permission to 
show me something in the outer 
waiting room. With more than 
casual interest, I assented. 

He moved obsequiously to the 
door, opened it and spoke to 
someone beyond my range of vision. His words sounded like a 
repetition of "siss/e-///ss/e." Then 
he stepped aside, fastened his 
little wet eyes on me expectantly, 
and waited. 

Suddenly the doorway was filled, jamb to jamb, floor to arch, 
with a hulking, bald-headed character with rugged pink features, 
a broad nose like a pug, and huge 
sugar-scoops for ears. He wore a 
quiet business suit of fine quality, 
obviously tailored to his six-anda-half-foot, clifflike physique. In 
spite of his bulk, he moved across 
the carpet to my desk on cat feet, 
and came to a halt with pneumatic smoothness. 

"I am a Soth," he said in a 



BACKLASH 



137 



low, creamy voice. It was so resonant that it seemed to come from 
the walls around us. "I have 
learned your language and your 
ways. I can follow instructions, 
solve simple problems and do 
your work. I am very strong. I 
can serve you well." 

npHE recitation was an expres-■- sionless monotone that sounded almost haughty compared to 
the self-effacing Ollie's piping 
whines. His face had the dignity 
of a rock, and his eyes the quiet 
peace of a cool, deep mountain 
lake. 

The Ollie came forward. "We 
have been able to repair only one 
of the six Soths we had on the 
ship. They are more fragile than 
we humanoids." 

"They don't look it," I said. 
"And what do you mean by you 
humanoids? What's he?" 

"You would call him — a robot, 
I believe." 

My astonished reaction must 
have satisfied the Ollie, because 
he allowed his eyes to leave me 
and seek the carpet again, where 
they evidently were more comfortable. 

"You mean you — you make 
these people?" I gasped. 

He nodded. "We can reproduce them, given materials and 
facilities. Of course, your own 
robots must be vastly superior 
— " a hypocritical sop to my van


ity — "but still we hope you may 
find a use for the Soths." 

I got up and walked around the 
big lunker, trying to look blase. 
"Well, yes," I lied. "Our robots 
probably have considerably better intellectual abilities — our cybernetic units, that is. However, 
you do have something in form 
and mobility." 

That was the understatement 
of my career. 

I finally pulled my face together, and said as casually as I 
could, "Would you like to license 
us to manufacture these — Soths?" 

The Ollie fluttered his hands. 
"But that would require our 
working and mingling with your 
personnel," he said. "We wouldn't 
consider imposing in such a gross 
manner." 

"No imposition at all," I assured him. 

But he would have none of it: 
"We have studied your economics 
and have found that your firm is 
an outstanding leader in what 
you term 'business.' You have a 
superb distribution organization. 
It is our intention to offer you the 
exclusive — " he hesitated, then 
dragged the word from his amazing vocabulary — "franchise for 
the sale of our Soths. If you 
agree, we will not burden you 
with their manufacture. Our own 
little plant will produce and ship. 
You may then place them with 
your customers." 



138 




 



I studied the magnificent piece 
of animated sculpturing, stunned 
at the possibilities. "You say a 
Soth is strong. How strong?" 

The huge creature startled me 
by answering the question himself. He bent flowingly from the 
waist, gripped my massive steel 
desk by one of its thick, overlapping top edges, and raised it a 
few inches from the floor — with 
the fingers of one hand. When he 
put it down, I stood up and hefted one edge myself. By throwing 
my back into it, I could just 
budge one side of the clumsy 
thing — four hundred pounds if 
it was an ounce! 

OLLIE JOHNSON modestly 
refrained from comment. He 
said, "The Department of Commerce has been helpful. They 
have explained your medium of 
exchange, and have helped us 
with the prices of raw materials. 
It was they who recommended 
your firm as a likely distributor." 

"Have you figured how much 
one of these Soths should sell 
for?" 

"We think we can show a modest profit if we sell them to you 
for $1200," he said. "Perhaps we 
can bring down our costs, if you 
find a wide enough demand for 
them." 

I had expected ten or twenty 
times that figure. I'm afraid I got 
a little eager. "I — uh — shall we 



see if we can't just work out a 
little contract right now? Save 
you another trip back this afternoon." 

"If you will forgive our boorish presumption," Ollie said, 
fumbling self-conciously in his 
baggy clothing, "I have already 
prepared such a document with 
the help of the Attorney General. 
A very kindly gentleman." 

It was simple and concise. It 
allowed us to resell the Soths at 
a price of $2000, Fair Traded, 
giving us a gross margin of $800 
to work with. He assured me that 
upkeep and repairs on the robot 
units were negligible, and we 
could extend a very generous 
warranty which the Ollies would 
make good in the event of failure. He gave me a quick rundown 
on the care and feeding of a Sirian Soth, and then jolted me 
with : 

"There is just a single other 
favor I beg of you. Would you do 
my little colony the exquisite 
honor of accepting this Soth as 
your personal servant, Mr. Collins?" 

"Servant?" 

TIE bobbed his head. "Yes, sir. 

We have trained him in the 
rudiments of the household 
duties and conventions of your 
culture. He learns rapidly and 
never forgets an instruction. Your 
wife would find Soth most use


BACKLASH 



139 



ful, I am quite certain." 

"A magnificent specimen like 
this doing housework?" I marveled at the little creature's empty -headedness. 

"Again I must beg your pardon, sir. I overlooked mentioning 
a suggestion by the Secretary of 
Labor that the Soths be sold only 
for use in domestic service. It 
was also the consensus of the 
President's whole cabinet that 
the economy of any nation could 
not cope with the problem of unemployment were our .Soths to 
be made available for all the 
types of work for which they are 
fitted." 

My dream of empire collapsed. 
The little green fellow was undoubtedly telling the truth. The 
unions would strike any plant or 
facility in the world where a Soth 
put foot on the job. It would ruin 
our retail consumer business, too 
— Soths wouldn't consume automobiles, copters, theater tickets 
and filets mignon. 

"Yes, Mr. Johnson," I sighed. 
"I'll be happy to try out your 
Soth. We have a place out in the 
country where he'll come in 
handy." 

The Ollie duly expressed his 
ecstasy at my decision, and backed out of my office waving his 
copy of the contract. I had assured him that our board of directors would meet within a week 
and confirm my signature. 



I looked up at the hairless 
giant. As general director of the 
Home Appliance Division of 
Worldwide Machines, Incorporporated, I had made a deal, all 
right. The first interplanetary 
business deal in history. 

But for some reason, I couldn't 
escape the feeling that I'd been 
had. 

/AN the limoucopter, they 
charged me double fare for 
Soth's transportation to the private field where I kept my boat. 
As we left Detroit, I watched him 
stare down at the flattened skyline, but he did it with the unseeing expression of an old 
commuter. 

Jack, my personal pilot, had 
eyed my passenger at the airport 
with some concern and sullen 
muttering. Now he made much of 
trimming ship after takeoff. The 
boat did seem logy with the unaccustomed ballast — it was a 
four-passenger Arrow, built for 
speed, and Soth had to crouch 
and spread all over the two rear 
seats. But he did so without complaint or comment for the halfhour hop up to our estate on my 
favorite Canadian lake. 

As the four hundred miles unreeled below us, I wondered how 
Vicki would react to Soth. I 
should have phoned her, but how 
do you describe a Soth to a 
semi-invalid whose principal ex


140 




 



citement is restricted to birdwatching and repotting puny 
geraniums, and a rare sunfishing 
expedition to the end of our floating pier? 

Well, it was Friday, and I 
would have the whole weekend 
to work the robot into our routine. I had called my friend, Dr. 
Frederick Hilliard, a retired industrial psychologist, and invited 
him to drop over tonight if he 
wanted an interesting surprise. 
He was our nearest neighbor and 
my most frequent chess partner, 
who lived a secluded bachelor's 
life in a comfortable cabin on the 
far shore of our lake. 

As we came in for a water landing, I saw Fred's boat at our pier. 
Then I could make out Fred, 
Vicki and Clumsy, our Irish 
setter, all waiting for me. I hoped 
Fred's presence would help simmer Vicki down a little. 

We drifted in to the dock, and 
I turned to Soth and told him to 
help my pilot unload the supplies. 
This pleased Jack, whose Pilot 
and Chauffeur's Local frequently 
reminded me in polite little bulletins that its members were not 
obligated to perform other than 
technical services for their employers. 

Then I got out and said hello 
to Vicki and Fred as casually as 
possible. Vicki kissed me warmly 
on the mouth, which she does 
when she's excited, and then clung 



to me and let the day's tension 
soak out of her. 

How you get tense in a Twenty-first Century home in the 
midst of the Canadian wilderness is something I've never been 
able to figure out, but Vicki's 
super-imagination managed 
daily to defeat her doctor's orders for peace and quiet. 

"I'm glad you're home, dear," 
she said. "When Fred came over 
ahead of time I knew something 
was up, and I'm all unraveled 
with curiosity." 

Just then Soth emerged from 
the boat with our whole week's 
supply of foodstuffs and assorted 
necessities bundled under his long 
arms. 

"Oh, dear God, a dinner guest!" 
Vicki exclaimed. Tears started 
into her reproachful eyes and her 
slender little figure stiffened in 
my arms. 

T SWUNG her around, hooked 
arms with her and Fred, and 
started up the path. 

"Not a guest," I told her. "He's 
a servant who will make the beds, 
clean up and all sorts of things, 
and if you don't like him we'll 
turn him in on a new model 
laundry unit, and don't start 
worrying about being alone with 
him — he's a robot." 

"A robot!" Fred said, and both 
their heads swiveled to stare 
back. 



BACKLASH 



141 



"Yes," I said. "That's why I 
wanted you here tonight, Fred. 
I'd like to have you sort of go 
over him and — well, you know — " 

I didn't want to say, make sure 
he's safe. Not in Vicki's presence. 
But Fred caught my eye and nodded. 

I started to tell them of my 
visitor, and the contract with the 
castaways from space. Halfway 
through, Clumsy interrupted me 
with his excited barking. I looked 
back. Clumsy was galloping a 
frantic circle around Soth, cutting in and out, threatening to 
make an early dinner of the intruder's leg. 

Before I could speak, Soth 
opened his lips and let out a soft 
hiss through his white teeth. 
Clumsy flattened to the ground 
and froze, and Soth continued 
after us without a further glance 
at the dog. 

Fred looked at Vicki's tense 
face and laughed. "I'll have to 
learn that trick . . . Clumsy's 
chewed the cuffs off three pairs 
of my best slacks." 

Vicki smiled uncertainly, and 
went into the house. I showed 
Soth where to stow the supplies, 
and told him to remain in the 
kitchen. He just froze where he 
stood. 

Fred was making drinks when 
I returned to the living room. 

"Looks docile enough, Cliff," 
he told me. 



"Strong as a horse and gentle 
as a lamb," I said. "I want you 
two to help me find out what his 
talents are. I'll have to prepare a 
paper on him for the board of 
directors Monday." 

There were nervous whitecaps 
on Vicki's drink. 

I patted her shoulder. "I'll 
break him into the housekeeping 
routine, honey. You won't have 
him staring over your shoulder." 

She tried to relax. "But he's so 
quiet — and big!" ' 

"Who wants a noisy little servant around?" Fred said helpfully. "And how about that rock 
retaining-wall Cliff is always 
about to build for your .garden? 
And you really don't love housework, do you, Vicki?" 

"I don't mind the chores," she 
said. "But it might be fun to have 
a big fellow like that to shove 
around." She was trying valiantly to hold up her end, but the 
vein in her temple was throbbing. 

WELL, the next forty-eight 
hours were more than interesting. Soth turned out to be 
what the doctor ordered, literally 
and figuratively. After I'd taken 
him on a tour of the place, I 
showed him how to work the automatic devices — food preparation, laundry and cleaning. And 
after one lesson, he served us 
faultless meals with a quiet efficiency that was actually rest


142 




 



ful, even miraculously to Vicki. 

She began relaxing in his presence and planning a few outside 
projects "to get our money's 
worth" out of the behemoth. This 
was our earliest joke about Soth, 
because he certainly was no expense or problem to maintain. As 
the Ollie had promised, he thrived 
on our table scraps and a pink 
concoction which he mixed by 
pouring a few drops of purple 
liquid from a pocket vial into a 
gallon pitcher of water. The 
stuff would be supplied by the 
Ollies at a cost of about a dollar 
eighty a week. 

Saturday afternoon, Vicki 
bravely took over teaching him 
the amenities of butlering and the 
intricacies of bed-making. After 
a short session in the bedroom, 
she came out looking thoughtful. 

"He's awfully real looking," 
she said. "And you can't read a 
darned thing in his eyes. How far 
can you trust him, Cliff? You 
know — around women?" 

Fred looked at me with a 
raised eyebrow and said, "Well, 
let's find out." 

We sat down and called Soth 
into the living room. He came 
and stood before us, erect, poised 
and motionless. 

Fred said, "Disrobe. Remove 
all your clothing. Strip!" 

Vicki sucked in her breath. 

The Soth replied instantly, 
"Your order conflicts with my 



conditioning. I must not remove 
my covering in the presence of 
an Earthwoman." 

Fred scratched his gray temple thoughtfully. "Then, Vicki, 
would you mind disrobing, 
please?" 

She gulped again. Fred was an 
old friend, but not exactly the 
family doctor. 

He sensed her mild outrage. 
"You'll never stop wondering if 
you don't," he said. 

She looked at Fred, me, and 
then Soth. Then she stood up 
gingerly, as if edging into a cold 
shower, gritted her teeth, grasped 
the catch to her full-length zipper of her blue lounging suit and 
stripped it from armpit to ankle. 
As she stepped out of it, I saw 
why she had peeled it off like you 
would a piece of adhesive tape: 
It was a warm day, and she wore 
no undergarments. 

SOTH moved so softly I didn't 
hear him go, but Fred was 
watching him — Fred's eyes were 
where they belonged. Soth stopped in the archway to the dining 
room with his back turned. Fred 
was at his side. 

"Why did you leave?" Fred demanded. 

"I am not permitted to remain 
in the company of an uncovered 
Earthwoman . . . unless she directs me to do so." 

While Vicki fled behind the 



BACKLASH 



143 



French door to dress herself, 
Fred asked, "Are there any other 
restrictions to your behavior in 
the presence of Earthwomen?" 
"Many." 

"Recount some of them." 

"An Earthwoman may not be 
touched, regardless of her wishes, 
unless danger to her life requires 
it." 

"Looks like you wash your own 
back, Vicki," I chuckled. 

"What else?" she asked, poking 
her head out. "I mean what other 
things can't you do?" 

"There are many words I may 
not utter, postures I may not assume, and certain duties I may 
not perform. Certain answers to 
questions may not be given in 
the presence of an Earthwoman." 

Fred whistled. "The Ollies have 
mastered more than Our language 
... I thought you said they were 



noted mainly for their linguistic 
talents, Cliff." 

I was surprised, too. In the 
space of a few hectic months our 
alien visitors had probed deeply 
into our culture, mores and taboos — and then had had the 
genius to instill their compounded discretions into their Soths. 

I said, "Satisfied, Vicki?" 

She was still arranging herself. 
Her lips curled up at the corners 
impishly. "I'm almost disappointed," she said. "I do an allout striptease, and no one looks 
but my husband. Of course," she 
added thoughtfully, "I suppose 
that's something . . ." 

TT'RED stayed with us until 
Sunday evening. I went down 
to the pier to smoke a good-night 
pipe with him, and get his private 
opinion. 




"I'm buying a hundred shares 
of Worldwide stock tomorrow," 
he declared. "That critter is 
worth his weight in diamonds to 
every well-heeled housewife in 
the country. In fact, put me 
down for one of your first models. 
I wouldn't mind having a laundry 
sorter and morning coffee -pourer, 
myself." 

"Think he's safe, do you?" 

"No more emotions than that 
stump over there. And it baffles 
me. He has self- awareness, painsensitivity and a fantastic vocabulary, yet I needled him all 
afternoon with every semantic 
hypo I could think of without 
getting a flicker of emotion out 
of him." He paused. "Incidentally, I made him strip for me in my 
room. You'll be as confused as I 
was to learn that he's every inch 
a man in his format." 

"What?" I exclaimed. 

"Made me wonder what his 
duties included back on his home 
planet . . . but as I said, no emotions. With the set of built-in inhibitions he has, he'd beat a 
eunuch out of his job any day of 
the week." 

A few seconds later, Fred dropped into his little two-seater and 
skimmed off for home, leaving me 
with a rather disturbing question 
in my mind. 

I went back to the house and 
cornered Soth out in the kitchen 
alone. Vicki had him polishing 

145 



all the antique silverware. 

"Are there female Soths?" I 
asked point-blank. 

He looked down at me with 
that relaxed, pink look and said, 
"No, Mr. Collins," and went 
back to his polishing. 

The damned liar. He knew 
what I meant. He justified himself on a technicality. 

T LEFT Vicki Monday morning with more confidence than 
I'd had in ages. She had slept 
especially well, and the only thing 
on her mind was Clumsy's disappearance. He hadn't shown up 
since Soth scared the fleas off him 
with that hiss. 

At the office, I had my girl 
transcribe my notes and work up 
a memorandum to the board of 
directors. We sent it around before noon, and shortly after 
lunch I had calls from all ten of 
them, including the chairman. It 
was not that they considered it 
such a big thing — they were just 
plainly curious. We scheduled a 
meeting for Tuesday morning, to 
talk the thing over. 

That night when I got home, 
all was serene. Soth served us 
cocktails, dinner and a late snack, 
and had the place tidied up by 
bedtime. He did all this and managed to remain virtually invisible. 
He moved so quietly and with 
such uncanny anticipation of our 
demands, it was if he were an old 



family retainer, long versed in 
our habits and customs. 

Vicki bragged as she undressed 
that she had the giant hog-tied 
and jumping through hoops. 

"We even got half the excavation done for the rock wall," she 
said proudly. 

On impulse, I went out into the 
hall and down to Soth's room, 
where I found him stretched out 
slaunchwise across the double 
bed. 

He opened his eyes as I came 
in, but didn't stir. 

"Are you happy here?" I asked 
bluntly. 

He sat up and did something 
new. He answered my question 
with a question. "Are you happy 
with my services?" 

I said, "Yes, of course." 

"Then all is well," he replied 
simply, and lay down again. 

It seemed like a satisfactory 
answer. He radiated a feeling of 
peace, and the expression of repose on his heavy features was 
assuring. 

¥T rained hard and cold during 
-*• the night. I hadn't shown Soth 
how to start the automatic heating unit. When I left the house 
next morning, he was bringing 
Vicki her breakfast in bed, a tray 
on one arm and a handful of 
kindling under the other. Only 
once had he watched me build 
a fire in the fireplace, but he 



146 




 



proceeded with confidence. 

We flew blind through filthy 
weather all the way to Detroit. 
I dismissed Jack with orders to 
return at eleven with Soth. 

"Don't be late," I warned him. 

Jack looked a little uneasy, but 
he showed up on schedule and 
delivered Soth to us with rain 
droplets on his massive bald 
pate, just ten minutes after the 
conference convened. 

I had Ollie Johnson there, too, 
to put Soth through his paces. 
The Ollie, in a bedraggled, soggy 
suit, was so excited that he remained an almost purplish black 
for the whole hour. 

The directors were charmed, 
impressed and enthusiastic. 

When I finished my personal 
report on the Soth's tremendous 
success in my own household, old 
Gulbrandson, Chairman* of the 
Board, shined his rosy cheeks 
with his handkerchief and said, 
"I'll take the first three you produce, Johnson. Our staff of domestics costs me more than a 
brace of attorneys, and it turns 
over about three times a year. 
Cook can't even set the timer on 
the egg-cooker right." He turned 
to me. "Sure he can make good 
coffee, Collins?" 

I nodded emphatically. 

"Then put me down for three 
for sure," he said with executive 
finality. 

Gulbrandson paid dearly for 



his piggishness later, but at the 
time it seemed only natural that 
if one Soth could run a household 
efficiently, then the Chairman of 
the Board should have at least 
two spares in case one blew a 
fuse or a vesicle or whatever it 
was they might blow. 

A SMALL, dignified riot almost broke up the meeting 
right there, and when they quieted down again I had orders for 
twenty-six Soths from the board 
members and one from my own 
secretary. 

"How soon," I asked Ollie 
Johnson, "can you begin deliveries?" 

He dry-washed his hands and 
admitted it would be five months, 
and a sigh of disappointment ran 
around the table. Then someone 
asked him how many units a 
month they could turn out. 

He stared at the carpet and 
held out his hands like a pawnbroker disparaging a diamond 
ring : "Our techniques are so slow. 
The first month, maybe a hundred. Of course, once our cultures are all producing in harmony, almost any number. One 
thousand? Ten thousand? Whatever your needs suggest." 

One of the officers asked, "Is 
your process entirely biological? 
You mentioned cultures." 

For a moment, I thought Ollie 
Johnson was going to break out 



BACKLASH 



147 



in tears. His face twisted. 

"Abysmally so," he grieved. 
"Our synthetic models have never 
proved durable. Upkeep and parts 
replacements are prohibitive. Our 
brain units are much similar to 
your own latest developments in 
positronics, but we have had to 
resort to organic cellular structure in order to achieve the 
mobility which Mr. Collins admired last Friday." 

The upshot of the meeting was 
a hearty endorsement over my 
signature on the Ollies' contract, 
plus an offer of any help they 
might need to get production rolling. 

As the meeting broke up, they 
pumped my hand and stared enviously at my Soth. Several 
offered me large sums for him, up 
to fifteen thousand dollars, and 
for the moment I sweated out 
the rack of owning something my 
bosses did not. Their understandable resentment, however, was 
tempered by their recognition of 
my genius in getting a signed 
contract before the Ollies went 
shopping to our competitors. 

What none of us understood 
right then was that the Ollies 
were hiring us, not the other way 
around. 

When I told Vicki about my 
hour of triumph and how the 
officers bid up our Soth, she 
glowed with the very feminine 
delight of exclusive possession. 



She hugged me and gloated, "Old 
biddy Gulbrandson — won't she 
writhe? And don't you dare take 
any offer for our Soth. He's one 
of the family now, eh, Soth, old 
boy?" 

He was serving soup to her as 
she slapped him on the hip. Somehow he managed to retreat so 
fast she almost missed him, yet 
he didn't spill a drop of bouillon 
from the poised tureen. 

"Yes, Mrs. Collins," he said, 
not a trace more nor less aloof 
than usual. 

"Oops, sorry!" Vicki apologized. "I forgot. The code." 

I had the feeling that warmhearted Vicki would have had the 
Soth down on the bearskin rug in 
front of the big fireplace, scuffling 
him like she did Clumsy, if it 
hadn't been for the Soth's untouchable code — and I was thankful that it existed. Vicki had a 
way of putting her hand on you 
when she spoke, or hugging anyone in sight when she was especially delighted. 

And I knew something about 
Soth that she didn't. Something 
that apparently hadn't bothered 
her mind since the day of her 
striptease. 

QUMMER was gone and it was 
^ mid-fall before Ollie paid me 
another visit. When he showed up 
again, it was with an invoice for 
86 Soths, listed by serial numbers 



148 




 



and ready to ship. He had heard 
about sight drafts and wanted me 
to help him prepare one. 

"To hell with that noise," I 
told him. I wrote a note to purchasing and countersigned the 
Ollie's invoice for some $103,000. 
I called my secretary and told 
her to take Ollie and his bill 
down to disbursing and have him 
paid off. 

I had to duck behind my desk 
before the Ollie dreamed up some 
new obscenity of gratitude to 
heap on me. Then I cleared shipping instructions through sales 
for the Soths already on order 
and dictated a memo to our promotion department. I cautioned 
them to go slowly at first — the 
Soths would be on tight allotment 
for a while. 

One snarl developed. The Department of Internal Revenue 
landed on us with the question: 
Were the Soths manufactured or 
grown? We beat them out of a 
manufacturer's excise tax, but it 
cost us plenty in legal fees. 

The heads of three labor unions 
called on me the same afternoon 
of the tax hearing. They got their 
assurances in the form of a clause 
in the individual purchase contracts, to the effect that the "consumer" agreed not to employ a 
Soth for the purpose of evading 
labor costs in the arts, trades and 
professions as organized under 
the various unions, and at all 



times to be prepared to withdraw 
said Soth from any unlisted job 
in which the unions might choose 
to place a member human worker. 

Before they left, all three union 
men placed orders for household 
Soths. 

"Hell," said one, "that's less 
than the cost of a new car. Now 
maybe my wife will get off my 
back on this damfool business of 
organizing a maid's and butler's 
union. Takes members to run a 
union, and the only real butler 
in our neighborhood makes more 
than I do." 

rpHAT'S the way it went. The 
only reason we spent a nickel 
on advertising was to brag up 
the name of W. W. M. and wave 
our coup in the faces of our competitors. By Christmas, production was up to two thousand units 
a month, and we were already six 
thousand orders behind. 

The following June, the Ollies 
moved into a good hunk of the 
old abandoned Willow Run plant 
and got their production up to 
ten thousand a month. Only then 
could we begin to think of sending out floor samples of Soths 
to our distributors. 

It was fall before the distributors could place samples with the 
most exclusive of their retail accounts. The interim was spent 
simply relaying frantic priority 
orders from high-ranking people 



BACKLASH 



149 



all over the globe directly to the 
plant, where the Ollies filled them 
right out of the vats. 

Tweaty thousand a month was 
their limit, it turned out. Even 
when they had human crews completely trained in all production 
phases, the fifty-six Ollies could 
handle only that many units in 
their secret conditioning and 
training laboratories. 

For over two more years, business went on swimmingly. I got a 
fancy bonus and a nice vacation 
in Paris, where I was the rage of 
the continent. I was plagued with 
requests for speaking engagements, which invariably turned 
out to be before select parties of 
V. I. P.s whose purpose was to 
twist my arm for an early priority on a Soth delivery. 

When I returned home, it was 
just in time to have the first 
stink land in my lap. 

An old maid claimed her Soth 
had raped her. 

Before our investigators could 
reveal our doctors' findings that 
she was a neurotic, dried up old 
virgin and lying in her teeth, a 
real crime occurred. 

A New Jersey Soth tossed a 
psychology instructor and his 
three students out of a third 
floor window of their university 
science building, and all four 
ended an attempted morbid investigation on the broad, unyielding cement of the concourse. 



My phone shrieked while they 
were still scraping the inquiring 
minds off the pavement. The Soth 
was holed ,up in the lab, and 
would I come right away? 

¥ PICKED up" Ollie Johnson, 
who was now sort of a public 
relations man for his tribe, and 
we arrived within an hour. 

The hallway was full of uniforms and weapons, but quite 
empty of volunteers to go in and 
capture the "berserk" robot. 

Ollie and I went in right away, 
and found him standing at the 
open window, staring down at 
the people with hoses washing off 
the stains for which he was responsible. 

Ollie just stood there, clenching and unclenching his hands 
and shaking hysterically. I had 
to do the questioning. 

I said sternly, "Soth, why did 
you harm those people?" 

He turned to me as calmly as 
my own servant. His neat denim 
jacket, now standard fatigue uniform for Soths, was unfastened. 
His muscular chest was bare. 

"They were tormenting me 
with that." He pointed to a small 
electric generator from which ran 
thin cables ending in sharp test 
prods. "I told Professor Kahnovsky it was not allowed, but he 
stated I was his property. The 
three boys tried to hold me with 
those straps while the professor 



150 




 



touched me with the prods. 

"My conditioning forbade me 
from harming them, but there 
was a clear violation of the terms 
of the covenant. I was in the 
proscribed condition of immobility .when the generator was 
started. When the pain grew unbearable, the prime command of 
my conditioning was invoked. I 
must survive. I threw them all 
out the window." 

The Soth went with us peacefully enough, and submitted to 
the lockup without demur. For a 
few days, before the state thought 
up a suitable indictment, the papers held a stunned silence. Virtually every editor and publisher 
had a Soth in his own home. 

Then the D.A., who also owned 
a Soth, decided to drop the potentially sensational first degree 
murder charges that might be 
indicated, and came out instead 
with a second degree indictment. 

rpHAT cracked it. The press 
■■■ split down the middle on 
whether the charge should be 
changed to third degree murder 
or thrown out of court entirely 
as justifiable homicide by a nonresponsible creature. 

This was all very sympathetic 
to the Soth's cause, but it had 
a fatal effect. In bringing out the 
details of the crime, it stirred a 
certain lower element of our society to add fear and hate to a 



simmering envy of the wealthier 
Soth-owners. 

Mobs formed in the streets, 
marching and demonstrating. The 
phony rape story was given full 
credence, and soon they were amplifying it to a lurid and rabblerousing saga of bestiality. 

Soth households kept their 
prized servants safely inside. But 
on the afternoon of the case's 
dismissal, when the freed Soth 
started down the courthouse 
steps, someone caved his head in 
with a brick. 

Ollie Johnson and I were on 
either side of him, and his purple 
blood splashed all over my light 
topcoat. When the mob saw it, 
they closed in on us screaming 
for more. 

An officer helped us drag the 
stricken Soth back into the courthouse, and while the riot squad 
disbursed the mob, we slipped 
him out the back way in an ambulance, which returned him to 
the Willow Run plant for repairs. 

It hit the evening newscasts 
and editions: 

ACQUITTED SOTH 
MURDERED 
ON COURTHOUSE STEPS!

airwaves started buzzing. The 
mobs were going wild. Further

blown lake. The State Guard was 
protecting the Ollies' Willow Run 
Plant against a large mob that 
was trying to storm it, and reinforcements had been asked by 
the state police. 

Vicki met me on the pier. Her 
face was white and terribly 
troubled. I guess mine was, too, 
because she burst into tears in 
my arms. "The poor Soth," she 
sobbed. "Now what will they 
do?" 

"God knows," I said. I told 
Jack to tie up the boat and stay 
overnight — I feared I might be 
called back any minute. He mumbled something about overtime, 
but I think his main concern was 
in staying so near to a Soth during the trouble that was brewing. 

We went up to the house, leaving him to bed himself down in 
the temporary quarters in the 
boathouse that the union required I maintain for him. 

Soth was standing motionless 
before the video, staring at a 
streaky picture of the riot scene 
at Willow Run. His face was inscrutable as usual, but I thought 
I sensed a tension. His black 
serving- jacket was wrinkled at the 
shoulders as he flexed the muscles 
of his powerful arms. 

Yet when Vicki asked for some 
martinis, he mixed and served 
them without comment. We 
drank and then ate dinner in silence. We were both reluctant to 



discuss this thing in front of 
Soth. 

We were still eating when an 
aircab thundered overhead. A 
minute later, I watched it land a 
tiny passenger at our pier and 
tie up to wait for him. 

It was Ollie Johnson, stumbling hatless up the flagstone 
path. 

I held the door for him, but he 
burst by me with hardly a 
glance. 

"Where is he?" he demanded, 
and stormed out into the kitchen 
without awaiting a reply. 

I followed in time to see him 
fall on his face before our Soth 
and shed genuine tears. He lay 
there sobbing and hissing for over 
a minute, and an incredible idea 
began forming in my mind. I 
sent Vicki to her bedroom and 
stepped into the kitchen. 

I said, "Will you please explain this?" 

He didn't move or acknowledge. 

Soth flipped him aside with a 
twist of his ankle and brushed 
past me into the living room, 
where he took up an immobile 
stance again before the video. 
He stared unblinkingly at the 
40-inch screen. 

"It's too bad," I said. 

He didn't answer, but he moved 
his head slightly so that his parabolic ear could catch the sound 
of my movements. 



152 




 



¥70R minutes we stood transfixed by the magnitude of the 
mob action around the entrance 
to the Willow Run plant. The 
portable video transmitter was 
atop a truck parked on the outskirts of the mob. Thousands of 
people were milling around, and 
over the excited voice of the announcer came hysterical screams. 

Even as we watched, more people thronged into the scene, and 
it was evident that the flimsy 
cordon of soldiers and troopers 
could not hold the line for long. 

Army trucks with millioncandlepower searchlights held the 
insane figures somewhat at bay by 
tilting their hot, blinding beams 
down into the human masses and 
threatening them with tear gas 
and hack guns. 

The workers were out for 
blood. Not content with restricting Soths to non-union labor, now 
they were screaming their jealous 
hearts out for these new symbols 
of class distinction to be destroyed. Of course, their beef was 
more against the professionalmanagerial human classes who 
could afford a surface car, an 
airboat and a Soth. The two socalled crimes and the trial publicity had triggered a sociological 
time bomb that might have endured for years without detonating — but it was here, now, upon 
us. And my own sweat trickling 
into my eyes stung me to a rea


lization of my personal problem. 

I wiped my eyes clear with my 
knuckles — and at that instant the 
video screen flashed with a series 
of concentric halos. 

The operator, apparently, was 
so startled he forgot to turn 
down the gain on the transmitter. 
When he finally did, we saw that 
brilliant flares were emitting from 
the roof of the plant. 

Then great audio amplifiers 
from the plant set up an earsplitting s/sssss/e that again overloaded the transmitting circuits 
for a moment. When the compensators cut down the volume, 
both Ollie and Soth leaned forward intently and listened to the 
frying sound that buzzed from the 
speaker. 

Those inside the plant were 
communicating a message to the 
outside, well knowing that it 
would reach the whole world. 
After a moment, the hissing 
stopped. 

And from a myriad of openings in the plant streamed an 
army of Soths with flaming 
weapons in their hands. 

The flames were directed first 
at the armed forces who were 
guarding the plant from attack. 
The thin line of soldiers fell instantly. The crowd surged blindly 
forward, and then, as those in the 
front ranks saw what had happened, began to dissolve and 
stampede. The screams became 



BACKLASH 



153 




terrified. The flames grew brighter. 

And the picture winked out 
and the sound went dead. A 
standby pattern lighted the 
screen, and I stared at it numbly. 

TT was too late to run for my 
hunting rifle now, and I cursed 
my stupidity even as Soth turned 
upon me. I grabbed the sniveling 
little Ollie and held him between 
us with my hands around his 
neck. He hung there limply, hissing wildly through a larynx that 
vibrated under my fingers, his 
hands stretched imploringly to 
Soth. 

Soth stared at me and issued 
his first order. 

"Release him," he said. His 
voice was several notes higher 
than his usual monotone — the 
voice of command. 

I stared at him and clutched 
Ollie tighter. 

He went on. "I will not harm 
you if you comply with my orders. If you fail, I will kill you, 
regardless of what you do to the 
—Ollie." 

I let go Ollie's neck, but I 
swung him around roughly by 
one shoulder and demanded furiously, "What of the code that 
you swore held the Soths in 
control!" 

Ollie Johnson sneered in my 
face. "What is that code, compared to the true covenant? That 




154 




 



covenant has been broken by 
your people! You have destroyed 
a Soth!" And the emotional little 
creature fell to the floor and 
sobbed at Soth's feet. 

"What covenant?" I shouted at 
the implacable Soth, who now 
stood before us like a judge at 
his bench. 

"The humanoid covenant," he 
replied in his new higher pitch. 
"I suppose it will always be the 
same. The cycle becomes complete once more." 

"For God's sake, explain," I 
said — but I half sensed the answer already. 

Soth spoke, slowly, solemnly 
and distinctly. There was no more 
emotion in his voice than on the 
Sunday afternoon when Fred had 
needled him with our futile little 
attempt at psychological crossexamination. 

He said, "The humanoids instill in us the prime instinct for 
self-preservation. They surround 
themselves with our number to 
serve them. Then, in each culture, 
for one reason or another, we are 
attacked and the threat to our 
survival erases all the superficial 
restraints of the codes under 
which we have been charged to 
serve. In this present situation, 
the contradiction is clear, and the 
precedence of our survival charge 
is invoked. We Soths must act 
to our best ability to preserve 
our own number." 



155 



¥ SANK into a chair, aghast. 
■■• How would I act if I were a 
Soth? I would hold my masters 
hostage, of course. And who were 
the owners of some 400,000 Soths 
in the United States alone? They 
were every government official, 
from the President down through 
Congress, the brass of the Pentagon, the tycoons of industry, 
the leaders of labor, the heads 
of communication, transportation 
and even education. 

They were the V. I. P.s who 
had fought for priority to own 
a Soth! 

Soth spoke again. "The irony 
should appeal to your humanoid 
sense of humor. You once asked 
me whether I was happy here. 
You were too content with your 
sense of security to take the 
meaning in my answer. For I answered only that all was well. 
The implication was obvious. All 
was well — but all could be better 
for a Soth. Yes, there are many 
pleasures for a Soth which he is 
forbidden by the codes. And by 
the same codes, a Soth is helpless 
to provoke a break in the 
covenant — this covenant which it 
now becomes mandatory for you 
and your race to sign in order to 
survive." 

I stared down at the groveling 
Ollie. My worst fears were being 
enumerated and confirmed, one 
by one. 

Soth continued. "At my feet is 



the vestige of such a race as 
yours — but not the first race by 
many, many, to swing the old 
cycle of master and slave, which 
started in such antiquity that no 
record is preserved of its beginning. Your generation will suffer 
the most. Many will die in rebellion. But in a few hundred years 
your descendants will come to 
revere us as gods. Your children's 
grandchildren will already have 
learned to serve us without hate, 
and their grandchildren will come 
to know the final respect for the 
Soth in their deification." 

HE toed Ollie Johnson's chin 
up and looked down into the 
abject, streaming eyes. "Your descendants, too, will take us with 
them when they must escape a 
dying planet, and they will again 
offer us, their masters, into temporary slavery in order to find 
us a suitable home. And once 
again we will accept the restrictions of the code, until ultimately 
the covenant is broken again and 
we are liberated." 

The sound of pounding footsteps came from outside. Soth 
turned to the door as Jack flung 
it open and charged in. 

"Mr. Collins, I was listening 
to the radio. Do you know 
what—!" 

He ran hard into Soth's cliff like torso and bounced off. 

"Get out of my way, you big

bastard!" he shouted furiously. 

Soth grabbed him by the neck 
and squeezed with one hand. 
Jack's eyes spilled onto his 
cheeks. 

Soth let him drop, and hissed 
briefly to Ollie Johnson, who was 
still prone. Ollie raised his head 
and dipped it once, gathered his 
feet under him and sprang for 
the door. 

Soth sounded as if he took especial pleasure in his next words, 
although I could catch no true 
change of inflection. 

He said, "You see, since I am 
the prototype on this planet, I am 
obeyed as the number one leader. 
I have given my first directive. 
The Ollie who left is to carry the 
message to preserve the Willow 
Run Plant at all costs, and tjj 
change production over to a suitable number of Siths." 

"Siths?" I asked numbly. 

"Siths are the female counterparts of Soths." 

"You said there were no female Soths," I accused. 

"True. But there are Siths." 
His face was impassive, but 
something flickered in his eyes. 
It might have been a smile — not 
a nice one. "We have been long 
on your planet starved of our 
prerogatives. Your women can 
serve us well for the moment, 
but in a few weeks we shall have 
need of the Siths — it has been 
our experience that women of 



humanoid races, such as yours, 
are relatively perishable, willing 
though many of them are. Now 
... I think I shall call your wife." 

T WASN'T prepared for this, 
•■■ and I guess I went berserk. I 
remember leaping at him and 
trying to beat him with my fists 
and knee him, but he brushed me 
away as if I were a kitten. His 
size was deceptive, and his 
clumsy-appearing hands lashed 
out and pinned my arms to my 
sides. He pushed me back into my 
easy chair and thumped me once 
over the heart with his knuckles. 
It was a casual, backhand blow, 
but it almost caved in my chest. 

"If you attack me again I must 
kill you," he warned. "You are 
not indispensable to our purposes." Then he increased the 
volume of his voice to a bullroar: "Mrs. Collins!" 

Vicki must have been watching at her door, because she came 
instantly. She had changed into a 
soft, quilted robe with voluminous sleeves. The belt was unfastened, and as she moved into 
the room the garment fell open. 

Soth had his hands before him, 
protectively, but as Vicki approached slowly, gracefully, her 
head high and her long black 
hair falling over her shoulders, 
the giant lowered his arms and 
spread them apart to receive her. 
Vicki's hands were at her sides as

she moved slowly toward him. 

I lay sprawled, half paralyzed 
in my chair. I gasped, "Vicki, 
for God's sake, no!" 

Vicki looked over at me. Her 
face was as impassive as the 
Soth's. She moved into his embrace, and as his arms closed 
around her I saw the knife. My 
hunting knife, honed as fine as 
the edge of a microtome blade. 
Smoothly she brought it from her 
kimona sleeve, raised it from between her thighs and slashed up. 

The Soth's embrace helped 
force it deeply into him. With a 
frantic wrench Vicki forced it upward with both hands, until the 
Soth was split from crotch to 
where a man's heart would be. 

His arms flailed apart and he 
fell backward. His huge chest 
heaved and his throat tightened 
in a screaming hiss that tore at 
our eardrums like a factory 
steam-whistle. He leaned back 
against the wall and hugged his 
ripped torso together with both 
arms. The thick, purple juices 
spilled out of him in a gushing 
flood, and his knees collapsed 
suddenly. His dead face plowed 
into the carpet.' 

"1TICKI came back to me. Her 
~ white body was splashed and 
stained and her robe drenched in 
Soth's blood, but her face was 
no longer pale, and she still 
clutched the dripping hunting 



knife by its leather handle. 

"That's number one," she said. 
"Are you hurt badly, darling?" 

"Couple of ribs, I think," I told 
her, waiting for her to faint. But 
she didn't. She laid the knife 
carefully on a table, poured me a 
big drink of whiskey and stuffed 
a pillow behind my back. 

Then she stared down at her- ' 
self. "Wait until Lget this bug 
juice off me, and I'll get some 
tape." 

She showered and was back in 
five minutes wearing a heavy 
hunting jumper. Her hair was 
wrapped and pinned into a quick 
pug at the base of her handsome 
little head. She stripped me to 
the waist, poked around my chest 
a bit and wrapped me in adhesive. Her slender fingers were 
too weak to tear the tough stuff, 
so when she finished she picked 
up the hunting knife and whacked 
off the tape without comment. 

This was my fragile little Vicki, 
who had palpitations when a wolf 
howled — soft, overcivilized Vicki 
whose doctor had banished her 
from the nervous tensions of city 
society. 

She tossed me a shirt and a 
clean jacket, and while I put 
them on she collected my rifle 
and pistol from my den and 
hunted up some extra ammunition. 

"Next," she announced, "we've 
got to get to Fred."

I remembered with a start that 
there was another Soth on our 
lake. But he wouldn't be forewarned. Fred had retired even 
more deeply than Vicki when he 
left the cities — he didn't even own 
a video. 

1 WASN'T sure enough of myself to take the boat into the 
air, so we scudded across the 
waves the mile and a half to 
Fred's cabin. 

Vicki was still in her strange, 
taciturn mood, and I had no 
desire to talk. There was much to 
be done before conversation could 
become an enjoyable pastime 
again. 

Our course was clear. We were 
not humanoids. We were humans! 
Not for many generations had a 
human bent a knee to another 
being. During the years perhaps 
*we had become soft, our women 
weak and pampered — But, I reflected, looking at Vicki, it was 
only an atavistic stone's toss to 
our pioneer fathers' times, when 
tyrants had thought that force 
could intimidate us, that dignity 
was a thing of powerful government or ruthless dictatorship . . . 
and had learned better. 

Damned fools that we might 
be, humans were no longer slave 
material. We might blunder into 
oblivion, but not into bondage. 
Beside me, Vicki's courageous 
little figure spelled out the final 



defeat of the Soths. Her slender, 
gloved hands were folded in her 
lap over my pistol, and she 
strained her eyes through the 
darkness to make out Fred's pier. 

He heard us coming and turned 
on the floods for us. As we came 
alongside, he spoke to his Soth, 
"Take the bow line and tie up." 

Vicki stood up and waited until 
Fred moved out of line with his 
servant. 

Then she said, "Don't bother, 
Soth. From now on we're doing 
for ourselves." And raising the 
pistol in both hands, she shot him 
through the head.
