XGITING REPORT by CIVILIAN SAUCER INTELLIGENCE 



ZENOBIA IS CARRIED OFF 



I was present when the "winded shape out of nightmare", as the 
Nemedian Chronicles call it, appeared suddenly over the park at 
Tarantia, and swooped down upon Conan's Queen and carried her off 
in its arms before any of us quite understood what was happening. 

I Ray it, because there was no way of telling, then or later, what 
Hell had spawned this strange and evil bird-thing which struck at us 
from the sky. It did not search. It did not waver in irresolution. Like 
the hawk so dearly loved by our nobles, it struck true and straight — 
as if instructed — at the woman our King loved. 

One moment Queen Zenobia, incredibly beautiful daughter of the old 
King of Aquilonia, walked there on the balcony, talking gaily with 
those of us who thronged around her hoping For the slightest glance 
of approval, flushing with pride whenever she would place one soft 
hand on our shoulder and tell us how much she, and "My Lord", appreciated our services. 

And still wo failed her. 

As the Gods would have it, Conan was not there when it happened. 
Had he been there no Thing from Hell would have triumphed, that was 
certain. But an unlucky chance had taken him outside the palace 
grounds. There was to be a Feast that evening to celebrate the year 
of peace since the discovery of the Great Conspiracy. 

Suddenly the Sun seemed to cloud over and a chill of doom fell upon 
US. The trees moaned like lost souls lamenting their fate in the outer 
darkness. The very air suddenly had an evil feel to it. 

Someone cried out, a short terror-stricken shout. One moment there 
was a black dot in the sky. The next moment it was larger and still 
larger. At first it looked like a bird or a bat, but soon we saw its 
frightful shape, manlike but winged. Some of the archers attempted to 
aim at it. They could not move, and watched helpless as it swooped down 
on us, straight and true, with a rush of vast leathery wings, its 
strangely evil eyes gleaming. 

And suddenly the sun was shining again. 

We stirred, as if an enchantment had been lifted from us, and milled 
around, shouting our grief. Finally someone thought to send a messenger to Conan, but Zenobia was gone by then, carried off by this Thing 
that had flown out of the sky and then returned into nothingness. 
And Conan, our King, was once more alone.

L. SPRAGUE de CAMP 

This was the first time he 
had met this man whom he'd 
fought as war-chief of the 
Zuagirs and pirate admiral. 



— "Know furthermore, O 
Prince, that Conan the barbarian thus won at last to great 
fame and high estate as king 
of Aquilonia, the starry gem 
of the green West with its 
gallant nobles, sturdy warriors, intrepid frontiersmen, 
and beauteous damsels. But 
dark and terrible forces were 
at work to rock his throne and 
wreck his fortune. For, on the 
night of the feast at Tarantia 
to celebrate the year of peace 
that followed the overthrow 
of the conspiracy of Valerius, 
Tarascus, and Amalric, and 
the destruction of the wizard 
Xaltotun, Conatfs lately-wedded queen Z e n o b i a was 
snatched from the balcony of 
the palace by a winged shape 
out of nightmare and borne 
off eastward. Thinking it better to travel swiftly, anonymously, and alone than to take 
an army with him, Conan set 
out in search of his stolen 
mate. . *

1. THE RING OF RAKHAMON. 

THE SCORCHING afternoon sun cast searing rays 



The late Robert E. Howard is best remembered for Ids novels and stones 
about the incredible Conan the Cimmerian, that fantastic adventurer who 
storms out of the pages of a mythical pre-history, slashing, loving, conquering. Swedish Air Force off icer Bjorn Nyberg and L. Sprague de Camp 
continue the story of Conan here, a Conan fighting against fantastic odds.

CONAN THE VICTORIOUS

oyer the desert like whiplashes of white fire. Distant 
groves of palm-trees shimmered; flocks of vultures 
hung like, clumps of ripe 
black grapes in the foliage. 

A solitary rider halted his 
horse in the shade of the 
palm-fronds that fringed an 
oasis. Though he wore the 
snowy khalat of the desertdwellers, his features belied 
any thought of Eastern origin. The hand that shaded his 
questing eyes was broad and 
powerful and ridged with 
scars. His skin was browned, 
not with the native duskyness 
of the Zuagir, but with the 
ruddy bronze of the sunbaked 
Westerner. The eyes were a 
volcanic blue, like twin pools 
of unplumbable depth. A glint 
at his sleeve betrayed the fact 
that the traveler wore a coat 
of mail under his flowing 
dress. At his side hung a long 
straight sword in a plain 
leather scabbard. 

Conan had ridden far and 
fast. Plunging across country 
with reckless speed, he had 
broken four horses on his way 
to Koth. Having reached the 
expanses of desert that 
formed the eastern end of the 
Kothian kingdom, he had 
paused to buy a khalat and 
some bread and meat at a 
dingy, dirty-white border village. Nobody had barred his 
way, though many an unkempt 
head was thrust through a 
door in wonder at the speed 
of this lonely rider.

the horizon. In the -shimmering distance he detected the 
faint outlines of domed buildings and towering walls. This, 
then, would be the town of 
Khanyria in the kingdom of 
Khoraja. Here he would seek 
the help of Pelias the sorcerer in recovering his stolen 
queen. Five years before, he 
had met and befriended Pelias when the Kothian wizard 
lay imprisoned in the vaults 
of the scarlet citadel of his 
foe Tsotha-lanti. 

Conan spurred the black 
stallion towards the distant 
towers. "Crom!" he muttered. 
"I hope Pelias is in his full 
senses. Like as not he's lying 
drunk on his golden divan, 
dead to the world. But, by 
Badb, I'll wake him!" 

In the narrow streets and 
cobbled market-place of Khanyria, a motley throng swirled 
and eddied. Zuagirs from the 
desert villages to the northeast, swaggering mercenaries 
with roving eyes and hands 
on hilts, hawkers crying 
their v/ares, harlots in red 
k i r 1 1 e s and painted faces 
milled together in a flamboyant tableau. Now and then 
the crowd was driven by the 
armored retainers of a 
wealthy noble, his perfumed 
sedan-chair bobbing on the 
shoulders of ebon-skinned, 
oxmusked Kushite slaves.

Gate. K* ■ -'— i • wrfgOw

ers often passed into the city, 
but seldom such curious 
strangers as today's arrivals. 
Early this afternoon, in a 
cloud of dust stirred up from 
the desert sands, had come a 
troop of seven. The rider in 
the lead was a lean fellow of 
vulture-look, his narrow mustache framing a thin line of 
mouth. He was armed like a 
Western knight, though his 
cuirass and helm were plain, 
without any device. By his 
side rode a huge Stygian on a 
black horse. A khalat enshrouded the Stygian's form, 
and his only visible weapon 
wap a massive war-bow. 

The other five were all well 
armored, wearing serviceable 
swords and daggers at the : r 
sides and holding lances in 
their hands. 

It was not the custom of the 
Khanyrian city guard to stop 
strangers without good reason, for here East and West 
met to mingle, haggle, and 
trade tall tales. Nevertheless, 
Crassides cast a searching 
glance at the seven as they 
jingled away towards the 
northern quarter. They disappeared into the profusion of 
smoky taverns with mongrels 
yapping about their horses' 
hooves. 

The rest of the day passed 
quietly, but now it seemed 
that the trickle of odd strangers must go on. As the sun 
flung its last rays across the 
darkening . heavens, a tall, 
burnoosed foreigner reined 
in before the closed gate and 



UNIVERSE 

demanded entrance loudly. 

Crassides, called to the gate 
by one of the guards on duty, 
arrived just as the remaining 
guard shouted down: "What 
seek you here, rogue? We let 
no outlanders in at night to 
cut our throats and debauch 
our women ! State your name 
and errand before I clap you 
in irons!" 

The stranger's glowing 
eyes, half hidden beneath his 
kaffia, regarded the trooper 
icily. "My friend," said the 
stranger in a barbarous accent, "for words less than 
those I have slit a hundred 
gullets. Let me in or, by 
Crom. I'll raise a horde to 
sack this bunch of hovels !" 

"Not so fast!" said Crassides, thrusting the guard 
as : de. "Get down, you young 
fool, and I'll teach you how to 
speak to strangers later. Now, 
you, sir!" He spoke to the 
horseman. "We want no quarrels in Khanyria, and as you 
see the gate is closed for the 
night. Ere we open it, you 
must account for yourself." 

"Call me Arus," growled 
the stranger. "I seek Pelias 
the sorcerer." 

"Let him in," said Crassides. The heavy bolts were 
drawn. Two watchmen 
strained at the bronze handles, 
and one of the door-valves 
swung slowly open. The 
stranger cantered through, 
not even glancing at those 
around the gate. He headed 
for the northern district, and 
the click of his horse'* hooves 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS

dwindled in the distance. 

The discomfited young 
guard spoke to his captain 
with restrained heat : "Why 
do we let this insolent lout 
ride in as if he were lord of 
the city? Why not put a shaft 
through his ribs?" 

Cnusides smiled through 
his beard. "Years may teach 
you wisdom, though I doubt 
it. Have you never heard how, 
years ago', a northern barbarian like this one was captured 
by the warlord of one of the 
little city-states of Shemto 
the south? And how he escaped, rounded up a band of 
outlaw Zuagirs, and came 
back for vengeance? And how 
the savage horde stormed the 
city, putting the people to the 
sword, flaying captives in the 
public square, and burning 
everything except the pole on 
which the warlord's head was 
stuck? This fellow might be 
one of that sort. 

"But alone he can do us little harm. And if he means us 
ill, Pelias will know it by his 
arcane arts and take measures. 
Now do you begin to see?" 

Conan knew that Pelias 
lurked in a tower of yellow 
stone at the northern end of 
the city. He planned to visit 
the wizard first and later to 
seek board and lodging. Anything would do. His body and 
tastes had not been softened 
by his years of civilized life. 
A loaf of bread, a hunk of 
meat, and a jack of foaming 
ale were all he v.-r-tr-'. For 



sleep, why, he could use the 
floor of a tavern if all else 
failed. 

There came a muffled oath 
and a cry of fear. A door to 
the right flew open, and a 
young girl flung herself into 
the street. 

Conan reined in. The girl 
was shaped like one of the 
mekhrani that people the 
pleasure-houses in the paradise of Erlik's true believers. 
This Conan could readily see, 
for her simple dress was torn 
to tatters, leaving her white 
rounded thighs but scantily 
covered. Brushing back the 
jet-black tangle of hair from 
her face, she cast a terrified 
glance towards the door, 
which had closed behind her. 
Then her large eyes turned 
to Conan, sitting his horse 
like a statue. Her hand flew 
to her mouth in terror. 

"Now, lass, what's eating 
you?" spoke the Cimmerian 
roughly, bending forward. "Is 
your lover cross with you, or 
what?" 

The girl rose with a lithe 
motion. "Two drunken soldiers tried to molest me. I 
came to buy wine for my father. They took my money, 
too!" 

Conan's eyes flashed as he 
jumped to the ground. His 
barbaric code of chivalry 
made him hate a man's inflicting wanton brutality on a 
woman. 

"Steady, lass. We'll pull 
their fesards yet. Inst open

FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



the door. Are they the only 
guests?" 

Nodding in terrified confirmation, she led him to the 
tavern. Af ter a moment's hesitation she opened the door. In 
two long strides Conan was 
inside. The door clicked shut 
behind him. 

But no such scene as he had 
expected confronted him. 
Here were no drunken soldiers to be quieted by a couple 
of buffets. Seven alert armed 
men ranged the walls, swords 
and daggers gleaming in their 
hands. The determination to 
kill was in their eyes as they 
instantly rufhed upon Conan. 

A civilized man would have 
been stunned by surprise one 
second and cut down in the 
next, but not the giant Cimmerian. His keen primitive 
instincts gave him a flash of 
warning as he crossed the 
threshhold, and his lightning 
reflexes went instantly into 
action. No time now to draw 
the great sword; before he 
had it out, they would be upon 
him like a pack of wolves. His 
only chance lay in instant attack, surprising his attackers 
by its very boldness before 
they could ring him and close 
with him. 

A mighty kick sent a bench 
whirling against the legs of 
three of his adversaries as 
they rushed forward. They 
fell in a clattering, cursing 
tangle. Conan ducked a whistling sword-stroke of one of 
the other four and smashed 
his right fist into the man's 
face before the latter could 



recover his balance. Conan 
felt the man's bones crack 
i.nder the blow, which cast 
him back against his advancing comrac'.es. 

Taking advantage of the 
confusion, the Cimmerian 
burst clean through the ring 
of foes, wheeled with the 
speed of a panther, grabbed a 
heavy oaken table and, with 
a muscle-wrenching heave, 
hurled it into the faces of his 
enemies. Weapons c 1 attered 
to the floor and oaths and 
cries of pain rent the air. The 
lull in the fight gave Conan 
time to rip the great sword 
from its sheath and snatch out 
his dagger with his left hand. 

He did not wait for a renewed attack. His barbarian 
blood was roused by this 
treacherous ambush. Rushing 
in to attack, single-handed 
against the six who were still 
in action, Conan with a furious kick caved in the ribs of 
one rascal still on hands and 
knees. As he parried a thrust 
with his dagger, a savage 
swipe of his heavy sword 
sheared off the sword-arm of 
another. Arm and sword fell 
to the floor, and the man 
crumpled up, glassy-eyed and 
screaming, with blood spurting. 

That left four, advancing 
warily in a half-circle. The 
tall wolfish leader feinted at 
Conan's legs but almost lost 
his head to the Cimmerian's 
whistling counter-cut. He escaped by throwing himself to 
the floor. Just before he did 
so, Conan recognized the man 



CONAN T: IE VICTORIOUS 



as Baraccus, an Aquilonian 
noble he had exiled for plotting with the Ophireans. 

At that instant the other 
three rushed in. One desperate sword-stroke caught Conan on the helmet, denting it 
and dizzying him. Stars swam 
before his eyes, but he rlpned 
viciously upward and was "rewarded by a hoarse, gurgling 
scream. A dagger-point broke 
on the stout links o£ mail covering his right side, but a 
sword gashed his left arm. 

When he hastily wiped the 
blood from his face he saw 
that he faced but one enemy, 
as the Stygian, his dagger 
broken, had stepped back to 
pick up a weapon from the 
floor. The tall leader was rising from his fall. 

Conan stepped forward to 
close with his foe but his foot 
slipped in a pool of blood. He 
fell heavily. 

The assassin confronting 
him shrieked in triumph and 
rushed forward lifting his 
sword. Conan's foot lashed 
out and knocked the man's leg 
from under him, so that his 
blow went awry and he fell on 
top of the Cimmerian, impaling himself on the dagger 
that Conan thrust up to meet 
his falling form. 

Conan fl ung the body aside 
and, with catlike speed, 
sprang again to his feet to 
meet the attack of the rearmed Stygian. The dusky giant rushed towards Conan, 
eyes blazing with dark fires 
and lips foaming with impas


sioned hatred. Ducking- the 
swipe of the Cimmerian's 
sword, he whipped his white 
cloak around the blade, imprisoning it in the h?avy 
folds. The knife that the Stygian, had picked up was driven 
against Conan's side with 
such force that mail-links 
snapped and the point pierced 
the Cimmerian's body. But 
Conan ripped into the brown 
torso with swift and murderous thrusts of his own dirk. 
The Stygian's mouth flew 
open in awful pain, his dagger 
clattered to the floor, and he 
doubled up and followed it. 

Conan tore his sword free 
from the folds of the Stygian's dress and advanced upon 
the unwounded leader. 
"You've forgotten your 
knightly oaths since I kicked 
you off your estate, eh, Baraccus?" he snarled. "I should 
have had your head when I 
found out your treason, but 
this time will do as well as 
any!" 

Conan presented a terrible 
aspect. From beneath his 
dented helmet, blood flowed 
down the side of his sweaty 
face. His right side was red 
with gore, and a bloody rent 
showed in his mailshirt. Baraccus, remembering the horrific legends of the Cimmerian's former deeds, lost his 
nerve and whirled to flee. 
With a grating laugh, Conan 
tossed up his sword, caught 
the hilt reversed, and hurled 
the weapon like a javelin. The 
point smashed through the 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



(0 

back-plate of Baraccus' corselet. Baraccus pitched forward 
at full length, the sword 
standing upright in his back 
and a stream of blood running 
from his mouth. 

Conan relaxed a little, surrounded by enemies dead or 
unconscious. Then a voice behind him aroused his barbarian senses. He wheeled in a 
flash. , , 

A fat man stood in the back 
door wringing his pudgy 
hands. "Oh, mercy, what has 
happened to my fine house?" 
he wailed, his face creased by 
worry. "Blood all over! Furniture ruined!" 

Two strides brought Conan 
to the taverner, under whose 
chin he poised the point of 
his dagger. "You had a hand 
in this, you yapping dog !" he 
roared. "They could not have 
set this ambush without your 
help." 

"Mercy, lord! They threatened to cut my throat otherwise! That would have been 
almost better than this ! They 
said it would be swift arid silent. . ." 

Conan slapped the man's 
face with such force that the 
taverner was thrown against 
the door-jamb. He reeled, and 
blood ran down his chin from 
a cut lip. 

"Silence!" rumbled Conan, 
his anger appeased a little. 
"Be glad I don't flay you an 
inch at a time !" 

"Y-yes, lord!" The man 
we p.': in abject terror. 

"Now fetch a jack of wine, 



before I split your head! 
And of the best! Also some 
clean cloths to bind up these 
scratches." 

As the terrified taverner 
hurried off, Conan kicked a 
corpse out of the way and 
sank down wearily upon a 
bench. A thought struck him. 
Where was the handsome 
wench who had started all 
this? 

The host returned on trembling legs, holding a flask and 
a pewter goblet. With an impatient curse, Conan tore the 
bottle from him and upended 
it over his parched gullet. 
When the whole of the contents had poured down without interruption, Conan set 
down the empty container 
with a crash, wiped his 
mouth on his bloody sleeve, 
and turned his blue eyes 
upon the man. 

"Killing dries a man's 
throat," he said. "Now tell 
me: Where is the girl who 
was here with these men before I entered?" 

The fat taverner, green with 
fear, shook his head. "Noble 
lord, I never saw her until she 
came here yesterday, dressed 
in outlandish garments. She 
changed her garb in her room 
on the upper floor. I know 
not her name or aught else 
about her." 

Conan heaved himself to his 
feet, only a little troubled by 
wounds that would have incaoacitr.ted an ordinary man 
for days. Tearing h's sword 
out of Baraccus' body, he 



CONAN TH1 

thundered: "Lead me to her 

room at once ! And should this 
' prove another trap, your soul 
will rot on the black floors of 
Hell within the instant !" 

Knees knocking, the flabby 
Khanyrian led the way up the 
narrow stair. The Cimmerian 
followed, his eyes scanning 
every cranny with wolfish 
wariness. On the upper floor, 
his guide paused before a 
door and chose a key from 
the great bunch at his girdle. 
He unlocked the door and 
opened it wide to reassure 
the edgy barbarian. 

Conan decided that there 
was no chance of another ambush in that narrow room. 
The only furniture was a bed 
and a small table. On the bed 
lay green silks, a golden sash, 
a turban strip with an emerald 
pin, and a filmy veil. This 
was the garb of a Hyrkanian 
noblewoman, from the great 
and growing eastern empire 
of Turan. 

Wheeling and retracing his 
steps, Conan pondered this 
new enigma with clouded 
brow. 

With nostrils flaring and 
sword in hand, Conan stepped 
alertly from the tavern door. 
His limbs had become a little 
stiffened from his wounds 
and his side ached from the 
dagger-thrust, but he still had 
vigor enough to spring into 
the saddle of his waiting 
horse. 

He was mystified by the assault. He well knew that many 



VICTORIOUS 1 1 

men of different creeds, races, 
and stations thirsted for his 
blood and would have loved to 
roast his guts over a slow fire. 
On this mission, however, he 
had ridden swiftly, silently, 
and anonymously. Yet armored foes had ambushed him 
with gleaming blades. Something or someone had brought 
Baraccus from the West and 
the Hyrkanian woman from 
the East together to try to 
trap him. 

Conan shrugged the puzzle 
from his mind with the fatalistic equanimity of the barbarian. As he could not now 
grasp the whole picture behind the recent incident, he 
was content to wait until further information came to 
light. 

He cantered leisurely 
through the streets with eyes 
darting into the shadows. His 
thoughts came back to the 
beautiful woman who had 
nearly led him to his death. 
The sight of her supple limbs 
had fired his blood, and he 
meant to take a hot kiss at the 
very least as a reward for 
helping her. But now she was 
gone as if by magic. 

Emerging upon a wide, deserted square, Conan, aided 
by the dim light of the clouded moon, saw the outline of a 
spired edifice, pointing like a 
finger to the heavens. In the 
deepening darkness it 
gleamed dull yellow like the 
reflex of a dying sun. This 
was the tower where Pelias 
secreted himself from the un


12 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



desired company of his fellow-men. 

A broad expanse of 
gardens and lawns surrounded 
the yellow tower. No walls, 
fences or forbidding gates 
ringed it. They were not 
needed. Horrid legends, whispered in the dark of evening, 
had taught the Khanyrians to 
keep away from sorcerers' 
abodes, into which an intruder 
might enter but from which 
he would probably never return. 

Conan's horse shied at the 
edge of the lawn, whinnying 
and stamping. It chewed its 
bit and blew foam from its 
lips. 

"Crom!" muttered the Cimmerian. "It seems as if Pelias has unholy company. W ell, 
I can walk." 

He dismounted and stode 
up the narrow flagstone walk, 
his eyes roving and his hand 
on his hilt. Necromantic rites 
often drew nameless monstrosities in the night, as 
the smell of carrion attracts 
vultures. Conan had met many 
kinds of beings spawned in 
other times and planes of existence. Many could be fought 
and slain only by magical 
weapons or by incantations 
read from dusty volumes or 
pieces of crumbling parchment. But Conan's taste had 
never run to spells and counter-spells. He trusted his keen 
edged sword more than all 
the magical mummery. Howr '•*, He reached the tower 
•; seeing a single sign 



of life among the shrubs and 
flowers. 

Just then the clouds slid 
away from the moon. By the 
bright moonlight Conan saw 
that the yellowish color of 
the tower was caused by an 
abundance of small golden 
coins set in plaster. Conan 
peered at those on a level 
with his eyes. None was 
familiar, and he suspected 
that it was the same with the 
rest. All had the look of great 
age. 

"Conan knew that gold was 
considered a valuable auxiliary in making magic, especially in the form of coins 
from the ancient kingdoms. 
Here, thought Conan, were tokens from the long-dead 
realms of forgotten legendry, 
when priests and wizards 
ruled with awful terror, dragging naked virgins screaming 
to dark caverns where ghastly rituals were performed, or 
beheading thousands of prisoners in the public squares 
until rivers of bubbling blood 
filled the gutters. 

Conan shivered. Much evil 
was concentrated here. Nevertheless, he tried t". e iron 
door. 

The heavy slab of metal 
swung silently inward. Sword 
in hand, the Cimmerian entered, senses fine-whetted 
like those of a prowling tiger. By the faint light coming through the open door he 
could see two flights of 
stairs, one circling upwards 
while the other lost itself in 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



13 



the underground darkness. 

Conan's keen nostrils 
picked up an alien smell 
from the stairs leading downwards. He suspected that this 
musky odor wafted up from 
a maze of caverns beneath 
the tower. 

Suddenly he was startled by 
words in a deep resonant 
voice: "Welcome, Conan! 
Mount the stairs leading upward and follow the light!" 

Glaring about, Conan could 
detect no clue to the origin 
of the voice. It seemed to 
come from everywhere, reverberating like the tines of a 
temple gong. 

A glowing ball sprang into 
view in front of Conan, so 
suddenly that he took an instinctive step backwards. It 
hung in the air without visible support, shining brightly. 
By its light Conan saw that 
he stood in a hall adorned 
with tapestries of ancient and 
curious design. 

The glowing globe moved 
slowly towards the stairs. 
Conan followed it without 
hesitation. One never knew 
the mind of a wizard, but Pelias at any rate seemed welldisposed towards the Cimmerian. 

Not a creak sounded from 
the steps as Conan glided upwards, sword still in hand. 
The steps ended on a landing 
barred by a copper-sheathed 
door with esoteric signs engraved in fanciful and involved patterns on its ruddy 
surface. Some of these Conan 



recognized from his wanderings as powerful magical symbols from the secret knowledge of ancient races. He 
scowled distrustfully. Then 
the door opened silently and 
the shimmering light went 
out. 

Now there was no need of 
it. The room Conan entered 
was large and well-lighted. It 
was furnished with a mixture 
of flamboyant wall-decorations and expensive works of 
art from many lands. A multitude of wall-brackets held 
flaming tapers; soft rugs 
covered the floor. 

In the center of the room 
stood an enormous pillowstrewn divan. On this lay Pelias a tall lean gray-haired man 
in scholar's robes. His eyes 
were dark and meditative, his 
head narrow and well-formed, 
his hands and feet small and 
trim. He had been studying, 
for several volumes were 
scattered about the floor. 
Close by the divan, a large 
table was littered with parchment scrolls. At least they 
looked like parchment, 
though Conan knew that wizards preferred their mightiest 
spells to be written on cured 
human skin. 

On the wall hung a mirror 
in a simple iron frame, contrasting with the luxury of 
the other furnishings. Conan 
was not surprised by the sybaritic atmosphere. Unlike 
most sorcerers, PeKas had 
never looked askance upon 
the pleasures of the flesh. 



14 FANTASTIC 

"Welcome, Conan t" cried 
the magician. "It has been 
five years — " Then Pelias 
sprang up with narrowed eyes 
as Conan walked heavily forward, sheathing his sword. 
"You are wounded! And lately! You need a stronger 
draught than this wine. 
Wait!" 

Pelias turned to an ornately-carved cupboard and 
opened one of its many small 
doors. From a recess he took 
a crystal flask, half full of a 
liquid of smoky violet hue. 
Into a wine-cup he poured a 
good measure of the liquid 
and proffered it, saying : 

"Drink this, my friend. It 
is made from the secret herbs 
of the Misty Isles and the 
lands beyond Kush. It will 
heal your wounds and ease 
your tired muscles." 

Conan downed the draught 
with one mighty gulp. For a 
moment he grimaced. His 
veins seemed afire and his 
brain whirled and reeled. 
Then these feelings were replaced by sensations of wellbeing and content. A vast 
weight of weariness seemed 
lifted from his shoulders; he 
had not realized how fatigued 
his v/ounds and exertions had 
left him. 

Pulling off his dented helmet, Conan felt his tingling 
scalp under the bandoge. His 
chair was still matted with 
dried blood, but no wound 
could he find, not even a scar. 
His side and other wounded 
jrv... '.:zd stopped aching. 



UNIVERSE 

"Truly this is a magical 
brew, Pelias!" he said. 

"It is potent indeed. Apart 
from the rare ingredients, 
many potent incantations 
have been read over it to 
bring out the full powers of 
the recipe." 

Conan grunted as he pulled 
off his mailshirt. "Would I 
had possessed it many a former time in my life !" 

"Let us move on to the 
question of your errand. What 
brings you alone and in 
haste? I have not heard of 
any strife or great wars in 
the northwest, in which you 
might need my aid." 

"Were it only straightforward war. I would never ask 
magical helo," growled Conan. "But I find mvself pitted 
against dark and unknown 
powers. I need clues to lead 
me to where I can smite my 
foe." 

In swift, short sentences he 
told of the fateful event in 
Tarantia. 

For a long time Pelias 
brooded with his chin in his 
hands. His eyes were closed, 
and some might have thought 
him asleep. Conan, however, 
knew, that the wizard's brain 
was working with abnormal 
speed and keenness behind 
that deceptive mask. Slowly 
Pelias' eyes opened. 

"A demon of the darkest 
realms beyond the Mountains 
of the Ni?ht has stolen your 
snouse. I know how to sum- | 
mon one, but I thought I 
Shared that knowledge with \ 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS

no one el=e in the West." 

"Then fetch this fiend and 
we'll wriag the truth out of 
him !" 

"Not so fast, my hot-headed 
friend! Do not rush headlong 
into unknown dangers ! It is 
clear tlr?.t this demon hss been 
summoned by a sorcerer with 
powers superior to those of 
ordinary magicians. Shou'd 
we drag the fiend hither with 
Spells and incantations, we 
should hi\e both him and his 
master to cope with, and that 
roVht be too much for us. No; 
I k"ow a better way. The 
Iu'.rrer of L?.-;bokri shall pive 
u--, the " "S'ver !" 

He rc«. Ajain opening the 
cuohon-d, he brought out a 
duily-gleapilng cup whose 
rim was inscribed with curious symbols. 

From a small jar the wizard poured a measure of red 
powder into the cup. Then he 
placed the cup on a low ebony table beneath the plain 
iron-framed mirror. He threw 
back the folds of silk from his 
arm and made a cryptic gesture. 

Blue smoke began to spiral 
up from the cup. It thickened 
until its billowing clouds 
filled the room. Conan could 
but dimly discern the motionless form of the wizard, petrified in trance during his 
concentration. 

For an age, it seemed, nothing happened. Conan began to 
shift his weight with impatience when he heard Pelias' 
whisper: • • — 



"The sorcerer's de'fenses 
are strong, Conan. I cannot 
pierce them. Who is ycur tutelary deity?". 

"It would be Crom, the 
grim god of the Cimmerians." 
muttered Conan, "though I 
have had nought to do with 
gods for many years. I leave 
them a 1 one and they leave me 
a'one." 

"Well, pray to your Crom 
for help. We need it." 

Conan closed his eyes and, 
for the first taime in decades, 
prayed : "O Father Crom, who 
b.--e;-th>> power to strive and 
slay into a man's soul at 
birth, help your son against 
the demon that has stolen his 
mve. ..»' 

And into his brain he 
thought he heard the cold 
words come: "Long have 
you forsaken me, O Conan. 
But you are my true son for 
all that, in your striving and 
enduring and conciuering. 
Lock!" 

Conan opened his eyes. The 
smoke had begun to thin. The 
Cimmerian saw that the mirror did not, as one might expect, show the reflection of 
Pelias; indeed, it showed no 
reflection at all. Its surface 
was deep gray, as if this were 
a window to forbidden dimensions. In a low monotone, Pelias chanted an incantation in 
a tongue that Conan recognized as the secret language 
used by the priests of Stygia 
in their clandestine rituals in 
dark-walled Khemi. 

Slowly, so slowly that it 



16 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



was not immediately noticeable, a picture took form in 
the mirror. At first it was 
blurred and uncertain ; then 
swiftly it cleared and sharpened. In a bare, stonewalled 
room a cowled and robed figure sat at a low table, a scroll 
in its hands. 

The picture grew as if the 
point of vantage of the watchers moved nearer and nearer 
the hooded one. Suddenly the 
figure in the mirror threw up 
its head and looked full into 
their faces. The hood fell 
back from the yellow, hairless pate; the slitted, oblique 
eyes gazed coldly into theirs. 
The yellow one's right hand 
plunged into the folds of his 
robe and came out again 
holding a shining ball. The 
man made a motion as if to 
throw it — and then Conan exploded into lightning action. 

A whistling slash of his 
heavy sword, held in readiness against the unknown perils of the mirror, sheared the 
frame in two and shattered 
the reflecting surface into 
thousands of tinkling splinters. 

Pelias gave a start and 
shook hiikisalf -ike a man 
awrkening. He said: 

"By I s h t a r, Conan, you 
saved us both! That shining 
t'vr ^ was as deadly as a nest 
t" r-'r.-as. Had he managed to 
- ' 't'tit this room, we 
n torn to bits 
that might 



have destroyed half the city. 
I was spell-bound by the nece s s a r y concentration and 
could do nothing." 

"The devil with that," 
grunted Conan, who had never 
learned to accept praise graciously. "Now, what did all 
this mean? I saw the man was 
a Khitan. What has he to do 
with my quest?" 

Pelias' somber eyes rested 
upon the huge Cimmerian as 
his answer came from stiff 
lips. "My friend, these matters are deeper than I 
thought. The fate of the 
world may rest upon you." 

The sorcerer paused, swilling a draught of wine. Leaning back on his cushions, he 
continued. 

"The magicians of the 
West have long been aware 
that the effects of certain 
spells have been weakened or 
nullified. This condition has 
been growing more marked in 
recent years. During the past 
few months I have buried myself in research, prying for 
the cause of this phenomenon. 
And I have found it. 

"We are entering a new era. 
Enlightenment and reason are 
spreading among the peoples 
of the West. Aquilonia stands 
as a bulwark among the nations, strengthening its imperial powers by the naked, 
elemental force of the healthy 
barbarian mind. You have rejuvenated the nation, and similar forces are at work in other 
realms. The bonds of black 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



17 



magic are strained and broken 
by new factors brought in by 
the changed conditions. 

"Some of the most evil 
spells would now hardly succeed at all in the Western 
realms. This resistance of civilization to the magic of dark, 
ness is concentrated in the 
barbarian king of Aquilonia. 
You have long been the center of mighty happenings, and 
the gods look favorably upon 
you. 

"I grow old, I who am already older than men reckon. 
Nowadays I use my vast 
knowledge only to furnish a 
life of ease and comfort and 
to pursue my scholarly researches. I do not live as an 
ascetic in ragged robes, summoning red-eyed beings with 
slavering jaws and dripping 
claws to wreak havoc among 
innocent human beings. 

"But there is one who has 
long thirsted for absolute 
power over the world and all 
that dwell therein. Years ago 
he began to lay the groundwork for the gigantic, cataclysmal acts of dark necromancy that should rock the 
earth to its core and enslave 
its inhabitants. 

"This I learned through 
my unearthly spies: When, 
one night, he cut out the living heart of a virgin on an altar in a deserted temple by 
moonlight and iiiumbled a 
terrible incantation over it, 
he failed to get the results he 
sought. He was dumbfound


ed; this was his first attempt 
upon the Western countries. 

"His failure roused him to 
insensate rage. For days and 
nights without end he labored 
to find who opposed him, and 
at last he succeeded. You are 
his main obstacle. 

"This dark plan, whose oatlines I now grasp, is worthy 
of his twisted genius. By 
stealing your spouse, he 
forces you to go after her. He 
is sure you will be slain by 
foes along the way or slaughtered by the strange and unknown peoples that dwell east 
of the Ilirnelian Mountains. 
Should you by some feat of 
prowess or stroke of luck 
reach his haunts, he counts on 
slaying you himself by his diabolical powers. 

"Af ter that, the road to conquest will be open to him, for 
the resistance forged here in 
the West is too young yet to 
stand without its backbone — 
Conan, the king of Aquilonia !" 

Dryness rasped Pelias' 
throat; he sipped the wine. 

"As you know, I am accounted one of the mightiest 
magicians of the West, even 
though I nowadays seldom 
use my full powers. But 
should I be pitted against him 
of whom I speak, I should not 
have the chance of a ewe in a 
pool of crocodiles. The sorcerers of the East are mightier than those of the West, 
and he is the mightiest of all. 
He is Yah Chieng of Paikang, 
in Xhifcv." 



\m FANTASTIC 

r Conan pondered this information with somber eyes and 
immobile features. "By Crom, 
Pelias, there rests more upon 
my shoulders than I could 
ever fathom, if What you've 
said is true. But I care not for 
the fate of the world, if I can 
only get my Zencbia back!"' 
"Ah, my friend, the fate of 
you, of your queen, and of the 
world are fast entwined. This 
is Yah Chieng's supreme bid 
for power. He is sure of success, or the crawling snake 
would riot have dared attempt it. This kidnapping is 
but 'a trick to lure you from 
the We-t, which you are 
g-.jarding against evil Eastern 
sorcery. Think, man. and compare! Which is the more important: a single woman or 
the face of millions?" 

"The devil with that, Pelias!" roared Conan. "D'you 
think I would let my woman 
be torn from my side and 
then stay at home because I 
am some sort of wizard's 
jinx? May the demons of 
Shaggali eat the marrow of 
my bones if I care one cor>per's worth for kingship, 
nower, lands, or riches! I 
want my woman back, and I'll 
have her if I must carve my 
way through a hundred thousand swordsmen to reach that 
bald-pated scoundrel!" 

Pelias shrugged. He realized that the savage promptings that guided the barbarian's actions would not be affected by his disclosure of the 
deeper causes of the recent 



events. The only v :>Y; Conan really cared abov •. ru the 
one tha t now surround-: d him 
with red-blooded life. Pelias 

said : 

"Alas, the Fates have already spun their web, and I 
cannot change it. Now listen. 
Paikar.g. in Khitai, is your 
goal. There Yah Chieng lives 
in his purple tower, puarded 
by twa hundred giant Ktiitan 
sabrem.en. the most skilled in 
the East. He has usurped the 
po'vev of the rightful rulers, 
and he governs with flail and

By a '.va/e of his hand he can 
blot an soy from th: earth. 
I kr.:.w net if I can help you, 
but I vA 11 try. Come with me." 

The lean wizard rose and 
went to a small, gold-inlaid 
sicretarv- table made of some 
strange wood. He pressed a 
projection hidden among the 
carvings of one leg of the table. A small drawer shot out, 
and the wizard picked an object from it. It was a ring. 
Strangelv wrought, it did not 
shine with the fire of gold, 
nor with the icy gleam of silver, nor yet with the rich red 
of copper. Its dull-blue lustre 
was not like that of any 
known metal. All along its 
band were hieroglyphs of ancient origin. 

The seal, also, was strangely fashioned. It was of rhombic shape with the upper and 
lower points long and sharp. 
A careless man could easily 
prick himself with it. 

Pelias gazed at the ring for 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



19 



a moment. Its strange blue 
gleam was like a sword of icy 
flame in the room. The Cimmerian, with his fine-whetted 
senses, could feel the power 
emanating' from the thing. 
Then the wizard straightened and brushed back a 
grizzled lock from bis forehead. 

"Many moons have passed 
since I won this ring," he intoned. "For days and nights 
without cease I fought its 
owner, a powerful sorcerer of 
Luxor. The fury of the dark 
powers we unleashed might 
have devastated the land had 
not our spells and counterspells canceled each other. 
With brain whirling and 
senses reeling, I strove with 
him through eons of black 
time. When I felt I could not 
continue much longer, he suddenly gave up. He changed 
his form to that of a hawk 
and tried to flee. My strength 
resurged within me: I transformed myself into an eagle, 
swooped upon him, and tore 
him to shreds. Ha! Those 
were the days when I was 
young and gloried in my powers! 

"Now, my friend, I want 
you to wear this ring. It will 
be a powerful aid on your 
journey. Have you heard of 
Rakhamon?" 

Conan nodded. The southern countries were rife with 
legends of the past, but still 
the name of that dread sorcerer were whispered with 
caution, though a full century 



and a half had passed since 
his end. 

Many adepts in magic had 
sought for his secret books, 
said to be written on the dried 
skins of virgins flayed alive, 
but none had found them. If 
this ring was a relic of Rakhamon's possessions, it must 
be powerful indeed. 

"Aye, this is the ring of 
Rakhamon," said Pelias gravely. "Some of the unnatural 
beings summoned from the 
darker realms could not, once 
called, be controlled by the 
usual protective spells. Therefore he fashioned this ring of 
a metal he found in the stone 
of a fallen star during his 
travels in the icy north. He 
invested the ring with unimaginable powers by secret and 
nameless rituals, in which 
blood was spilled in profusion 
and screaming souls were condemned to the deepest and 
darkest hell. The wearer of 
this ring can stand against 
any beast summoned by magical arts, that much I know. 

"As to its detailed use, 
there is no clue. Probably the 
knowledge perished with the 
secret manuscripts. Take it, 
Conan! This is all I can aid 
you with. No other spells I 
know can avail against the 
evil power of Yah Chieng." 

Conan took the proffered 
ornament. At first it seemed 
too small for his massive fingers, but as he tried it on the 
middle finger of his left hand 
it slid lightly on. It seemed 
to have a life of its own; it 



20 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



fitted as if made to order. The 
Cimmerian shrugged. Decades 
of experience had made him 
casual about the pretensions 
of nragical things. The bauble 
might work, and if not no 
harm would come of it. 

"To the devil with all this 
talk," said the barbarian. "I 
have a long journey before 
me. A loaf, a joint of meat, 
and a skin of wine, and I am 
for bed. Could you spare me a 
cot for the night?" 

"Any sort of bed you desire, 
my friend. My servants will 
fetch food and tend your 
horse." Pelias clapped his 
hands. 

"That reminds me," said 
Conan, yawning. "I must sacrifice a bullock to Crom ere 
I set forth tomorrow. Say 
nothing of it, for, if they 
knew, people would say : Conan grows old; he is getting 
religious in his dotage!" 

2. VENGEANCE FROM 
THE DESERT. 

The sun glinted on spired 
helmets and steel spearheads. 
Spurs jungled and colorful 
silks flashed as three armored 
riders breasted the long slope 
of a great sand-dune in the 
wide desert that formed the 
southwestern marches of Turan. Upright from the boots 
that hung from the saddles of 
two of them rose the ten-foot 
Turanian lances. The remaining carried, slung from his 
saddle, a thick double-curved 
bow in a bow-case and a score 



and a half of arrows in a lacquered leathern quiver. 

Accompanying them was a 
fourth figure, bound' by both 
wrists to a rope held by a 
bowman. Deep gashes in the 
sand told of this prisoner's 
inability to keep up with his 
mounted captors. He wore the 
white khn-at of the desert 
Zuagir, though the garment 
was dirty and torn to shreds. 
His lean dark visage was hollow-cheeked, but implacable 
hatred lurked in his redrimmed eyes. 

The Turanian soldiers, separated from the rest of their 
troop by a two-day sandstorm, 
were seeking their way back 
to Fort Wakla, a Turanian 
outpost deep in the Zuagir 
desert country. Yesterday 
they bad met the Zuagir. His 
horse had tumbled under him 
with an arrow through its 
heart, and he had been laid 
senseless on the sand by a 
blow from a spear-butt. The 
commander of Fort Wakla 
had lately begun an intense 
campaign against the desert 
tribes, which had harried Turanian caravans overly much 
of late. Having taken the Zuagir prisoner, the horsemen 
were bringing him back to the 
fort to be bled of knowledge 
before being hanged. 

At the top of the dune, the 
little troop paused to rest. 
Sand-dunes stretched as far 
as the eye could see. As practiced warriors, the Turanians 
used the pause to let their 
hawk-like eyes sweep the hor


CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



21 



izon and the suriace of the 
sands. 

The tallest of the three, the 
man with the bow and the 
prisoner's rope, suddenly 
stiffened. On the top of a 
dune a mile away he had 
sighted a lone horseman riding at a gallop. The dune had 
hidden him as they came to 
their point of vantage, but 
now the stranger was flying 
down the. near side in a flurry 
of sand. 

"By the alabaster hips of 
Yenagra!" he said. "We have 
caught another desert rat! Be 
ready; we will kill this one 
and take his head on a lancetip back to the fort." 

Knowing there would be no 
trouble to recover the, Zuagir 
after the fight, he dropped 
the rope. He spurred his 
mount down the slope towards 
the point in the wide valley of 
sand where he counted on intercepting the stranger, and 
in one smooth motion drew 
the powerful bow from its 
case and nocked an arrow. His 
fellow-troopers followed with 
spears poised. 

At three hundred paces, the 
bowman drew and loosed at 
full gallop with the effortless horsemanship of a Turanian cavalryman. But the 
shaft did not strike home. 
Like lightning his intended 
victim flung his horse aside 
with a mighty effort that almost threw the steed. With a 
swift gesture, the stranger 
shook off the folds of his 
khalat. 



The Hyrkanians. halted in 
consternation. There appeared 
before them not the halfstarved form of a desert man, 
armed only with knife and 
javelin, but a powerful Western warrior in sturdy mail and 
steel helmet, equipped with a 
long sword and dagger. The 
sword flashed like a flame in 
the sunlight as the rider 
whipped it out. The Turanian leader's narrow eyes widened with astonishment. 

"You dare return to Turan, 
barbarian scoundrel!" he 
cried. For the Turanian was 
Harnar Kur, who had been 
emir of a troop of horses 
that Conan, as a leader of the 
kozaki, had routed years before by an ambush on the Yelba River. Hamar Kur was demoted to common trooper in 
the frontier guards in consequence. Drawing his saber, he 
shouted : 

"At him, men! It is Conan 
the kozak! Slay him, and the 
king will fill your helmets 
v/ith gold!" 

The Turanian riders hesitated, awed by the memory 
of gory and terrible legends 
associated with that name. 
They told how he, with a 
band of Zuagir tribesmen, had 
harried the outflung Imperial 
posts in the south until the 
border had to be drawn back. 
They told how the savage 
kozak hordes under his command had stormed the walled 
city of Khorosun, slaying and 
burning. 

Conan made full use of his 



22 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



enemies' moment of indecision. Spurring his big horse, 
he thundered upon them like 
a one-man avalanche, his 
sword flashing in circles. 
Hamar Kur's mount reared 
wildly before this crashing 
charge and was cast to the 
ground. 

The two other soldiers 
couched their Ir.nces and 
spurred fiercely, but lacked 
time to gain enough speed to 
make their charge effective. 
With the fury of a thunderstorm Conan was upon them, 
smiting right and left. The 
head of one man leaped from 
its trunk on a fount of blood. 
The next instant, Conan's 
blade shattered the ether's 
lance. The Turanian caught 
the following blew on his 
shield but was hurled from 
his saddle bv sheer impact. 

Hamar Kur had regained 
his feet. Skilled in combat 
against horsemen, he ran to 
where the slain trooner had 
dropped his lance. Then he 
ran swift Jv up and thrust the 
shaft of the weapon between 
the legs of the Conan's horse. 
He cast himself aside at the 
last moment to avo'd the barbarian's terrible sword. 

The desert sands clouded 
the sky as Conan and his 
mount crashed to the ground 
together. With the practiced 
ease of the hardened mercenary, the Cimmerian threw 
himself clear. He rose, sword 
still in hand. With cold bhie 
eyes slitted- he watched his 
] two surviving enemies slink 



towards him, one from either 
side. 

With tigerish swiftness, he 
charged the soldier to the 
right. The Turanian tried to 
parry the crashing blow, but 
to no avail. Splintering the 
curved b^de with its terrible 
force, the Cimmerian's sword 
smashed helmet and skull 
like a ripe orange. 

Conan wheeled like a panther in the nick of time. He 
just managed to catch Hamar 
Kur's whistling blow on bis 
sword -hi It. There was a momentary exchange of cuts and 
parries as the straight blade 
of the West and the curved 
blade of the Eant whirled 
about each other in a coruscating dance of death. Then a 
quick thrust from Conan 
pierced his enemy's breast. 
The point drove through the 
fine Turanian mail and on 
through the €x -emir's body. 
Hamar gave a ghastly scream 
and fell heavily. 

The Cimmerian wiped his 
sword on his enemy's sash 
and looked swiftly around. 
He had heard a sound from 
behind, and his senses and 
temper were on edge. He 
waited warily as a tattered 
figure half slid and half 
rolled down the slope almost 
to his feet. It was the Zuagir. 
Rising on shaky legs, he spat 
upon the prostrate form of 
Hamar Kur. Then he turned 
his burning eyes on Conan. 
As he took in the gigantic 
figure in worn mail, the rage 
and fury in his eyes gave 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



23 



way to recognition and joy. 
Lifting his bound hands, he 
cried : 

"Praise be to Kemosh, for 
he has answered my prayers 
and sent these dogs to the 
floors of Hell! And more, he 
has brought back the great 
warlord who led us to plunder long ago! I greet you, 
Hawk of the Desert! The 
Turanian dogs v/ill cower in 
their towers as the cry goes 
forth from the desert: 'Yamad al-Aphta has returned !' " 

Conan shrugged his broad 
shoulders and thrust his 
sword back into the scabbard. His horse had risen 
from its fall, and Conan unslung his waterskin and pack 
from the saddle. 

"Here, wolf," he grunted, 
"you look a little the worse 
for wear. Have a draught, but 
take care you are not overfilled." Conan brought out 
bread and dried meat and 
shared them with the Zuagir. 
"Now tell me: What is afoot 
in the desert? How did you 
fall into the hands of the 
Hyrkanians?" 

The nomad answered between gulps and champings: 
"I am Yar Allal of the Dua'i 
tribe. I was riding in haste 
and alone for our camp when 
these doy;s caught me. They 
were bringing me back to 
Fort Wakla for questioning 
and death." 

"Whence your hurry?" 
asked Conan. "And wl.y 
alone? These hills swarm 
with Turanian patrols." 



The voice of the Zuagir 
took on a burning' edge as he 
answered. "A terrible misfortune has struck our tribe. 
Listen, my lord. For days we 
lay in wait in the ruins of the 
Gharat temple, fifty miles to 
the south. Word had come 
that a rich caravan was approaching from the west, 
bringing the wealth and person of the lady Thanara." 

"Who's that?" 

"A yedka of Maypur, 
famed for her beauty and 
riches. Furthermore she is 
high in the favor of King 
Yezdigerd. Could we but 
capture her, a fabulous ransom would be ours as well as 
the spoils from the cameltrain. 

"We lay there with knives 
whetted and bows newly 
strung until we thought the. 
dogs of traders would never 
come. And then, one day, we 
heard the camels' bells in the 
distance. 

"We v/aited until they 
were almost upon us. Uttering our warcry, we swept 
down upon them. We exoected an easy conquest of the 
merchants and their retainers. Then, suddenly, the 
merchants and servants threw 
aside their khaiats. Instead of 
timid civilians, mailed lancers 
in the white turbans of the 
Imperial Guard rushed 
against us! 

"There must- have been a 
hundred o F them hidden in 
the wains. They rode through 
our ranks like reapers mov


24 FANTASTIC 

ing down a field of wheat. 
Half of us perished in the 
first attack. We fought 
mightily against the odds, 
and many a Turanian plunged 
to earth with a Duali spear 
through his throat or a 
curved knife in his guts. 

"But our courage was of 
no avail as the steel-clad 
ranks closed in upon us. Then 
Yin Allal, my father, caught 
a blow on the head that 
knocked him stunned from 
the saddle. I spurred my 
horse; smiting and thrusting 
I won through and away. 
They pursued me for hours, 
but their horses were wearier 
than mine and they gave it 
up. I was on my way to raise 
the tribe as I was caught. By 
now the caravan is safely 
within the walls of Fort 
Wakla. There will be rejoicing among the Turanians tonight; not for decades have 
they captured a Zuagir chief 
alive ! M 

"How you know he is 
alive?" 

"In the last moment ere I 
raced off, I looked back and 
saw two of them carrying him 
back towards the carts. He 
was moving, though feebly." 

Conan digested his ta 1 e. He 
well remembered Yin Allal, 
one of his staunchest supporters of old, when he, as warchief of three united Zuagir 
tribes, had led them in daring 
raids against the Turanians. 
Confronted by this new problem, he did not wish to leave 
an old friend unaided in the 



UNIVERSE 

hands of his enemies. He 
sprang up, his blue eyes 
flashing with determination. ^ 

"Catch yourself a horse!" 
he snapped. "We ride for the 
Duali oasis at once. We shall 
be there by nightfall, and if 
my name is not forgotten I'll 
raise the tribes again. We'll 
pull these dogs' beards yet, 
by Crom!" 

With a laugh he flung himself into the saddle. Gesturing to his companion to follow, he spurred his horse 
into a fierce gallop. 

The oasis lay enfolded in 
the black arms of the desert 
night. Stars twinkled like 
gems on a dark mantle studded with diamonds; the 
fronds of the palms, now and 
then moving before the slight 
evening breeze, were silvered 
by the cold moonlight. In the 
shadow of the foliage were 
strewn a profusion of tents — 
a large Zuagir camp. 

Earlier in the day this had 
been a quiet place. The desert 
sun poured its golden rays upon the camel's-hair dwellings. 
Veiled women went about 
their primitive duties, fetching water from the well and 
broiling strips of meat over 
the camofires. Snores and 
snuffles founded from the 
nomadic abodes as the tribesmen took their siesta. _ 

Now the Duali oasis was 
a center of frantic activity. 
In the middle rose a tent 
whose size indicated its importance. From this tent, now 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



25 



and then, a lean desert hawk 
emerged. The Zuagir would 
hurry with flapping khalat to 
his horse, spring into the saddle, and urge the mount into 
a mad race out over the desert. O I hers returned from 
their missions, f linging themselves from f cam-flecked 
steeds to hasten towards the 
big central tent. Zuaglrs 
from the neighboring tribes 
of the Kharoya and Qirlata 
had been pouring in ail day. 
Now the area covered by duncolored tents was thrice as 
large as the day before. There 
was an orderly bustle such as 
is seldom seen in a desert 
camp. 

The hearts of the robed and 
bearded chiefs in the central 
tent swelled with pride and 
affection. The huge figure in 
worn mail, seated in the place 
of honor, had become the 
center of legendry and heroworship since the day long 
ago when he had arrived 
among them. He united their 
bickering clans and led them 
in raids so daring, bloody, 
and rewarding that tales of 
them were still told around 
the campfires. Their superstitious minds regarded the 
return of the big Cimmerian 
as a good omen. Petty intertribal quarrels were swept 
away by the return of the 
Hawk of the Desert. 

''The fort is impregnable 
to a straight assault," he said 
bluntly. "We have no ballistae or other siege-engines to 
reduce it by force. It is well 



provisioned, like all- these 
Turanian outposts, and might 
hold out for a year. Moreover, 
a determined sally by their 
seasoned squadrons would 
scatter our irregular ranks. 
Our chance is to come to 
grips with them inside the 
walls, where cavalry tactics 
cannot be used and we have 
the advantage of numbers. 
Trickery must be used. 

Let us equip a caravantrain from the loot stored 
here in this oasis. Fifty of 
us, garbed as merchants, 
slaves, retainers, and cameldrivers shall take the caravan 
to the fort, as if we were on 
the road to Khardpur. At the 
twelfth hour we shall cut 
down the guards at the gate, 
open up, and let in the horde. 
We shall. pillage, burn, sack, 
and slay until the streets run 
red with Turanian blood!" 

The Cimmerian rose, hitching at his scabbard. "To work, 
desert dogs! Before sunrise, I 
want such a camel-train as 
would make any Zuagir's 
mouth water!" 

Camel-bells tinkled. The 
feet of men and beasts raised 
clouds of dust as the long line 
passed through the gate of 
Fort Wakla. At the gate, the 
lean merchant in the lead declared: "Lord, I am Zebah, a 
Shemite of Anakia. I have 
come up from Yukkub to barter my goods in Khardpur." 

"Who is this?" asked" the 
gate-captain, pointing to one 
man in a capacious khalat. 



26 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



"This is my personal servant and bodyguard," declared the leader, "a Stygian. 
The others are hired guards, 
camel-drivers, and slaves. By 
Ashtoreth, it is good to be 
safely within walls again! I 
had feared attacks from the 
Zuagir bands. But the gods 
protected us, so none of those 
stinking vermin of the desert 
assailed us." 

The captain of the watch 
grinned. "Your precautions 
were wasted, my ma a. Just 
now a naked woman could 
ride alone and unmo^sted 
along the caravan-trail. Yesterday a squadron of the Imperial Guards smashed a host 
of the desert rats and captured their chieftain." 

"Ah!" said the Shemite. 
"That is indeed glorious 
news." 

"All in the day's work. But 
at least this show of force 
should stop the raids for a 
while. Veziz Shah has ordered 
us to slay any Zuagir, man, 
woman, or child, caught by 
our patrols. By the time you 
return to Yukkub, you will 
be able to travel the length 
and the breadth of the Zuagir 
desert without fear cf molestation." 

"I will burn an offering to 
Bel as a measure of my gratitude," said the merchant, as 
the last of the. camels shambled through the gate. Four 
guardsmen closed the gate; 
its ironclad valves swung 
creakingly shut on hinges as 
thick as a man's leg. 



The fort was really a small 
city. A high crenelated wall 
of stone girded the mass of 
buildings with parapets and 
battlements. The space within was roomy, and merchants 
and thieves found their 
means of support in the profusion of buildings. Isolated 
as it was, Fort VVakla must 
contain within itself the 
means of civilized living, 
with drinking-shops, brothels, 
and gambling-houses to keep 
the garrison happy. 

At the spacious marketplace in the center, mailed 
soldiers in spired helmets and 
robed merchants with exotic 
wares and veiled women 
milled about. To one side rose 
the mighty citadel where the 
governor lived, a fortress in 
itself with gray stone walls, 
narrow windows, and heavy 
copper doors. Those who had 
been inside, however, averred 
that the interior belied the 
grimness of the outside. It 
was heaped with art-treasures, 
fitted with comfortable furniture, and stocked with fine 
wine and viands. 

Evening had come. The sky 
darkened swiftly, and here 
and there candles and lamps 
illuminated the windows. 
Sweating taverners bore winecasks from their cellars for 
the evening rush of customers. The colorful night-life 
of a Iiyrkanian city was beginning. 

In the charters bv the 
western wall, reserved for 
vis-ling caravr.ns, arguments 


COHAN THE VICTORIOUS 



27 



raged around the campfires of 
Conan's band. Nearly all advocated staying there in safety, unsuspected, until the appointed hour had come. But 
Conan was of another mind. 
With a good two hours to 
spare, he meant to find out as 
much as he could about the 
disposition of the enemy. 
The quarters of the officers 
and common soldiers he had 
already located, close by the 
main gate, but he did not 
know the number of the 
troops quartered there. 

"May the fiends cut off 
your tongues!" he rumbled. "I 
will do as I have said. In the 
tavern district there will be 
scores of drunken soldiers 
off duty. From one of them I 
shall get the information I 
want if I have to wring; it 
from him like a sodden 
cloth!" 

The iron determination of 
the Cimmerian swept aside 
the objections of his followers. He wrapped his khalat 
about him and strode away, 
hiding his face under the kaffia. 

The fumes of sour wihe, 
stale beer, and sweat struck 
. Conan in the face as he en\ tered the first drinking-shop. 
\ The carousal was in full 
| swing. Wenches hurried to 
| and fro with jacks of foaming 
ale and flagons of wine, while 
painted hussies dawdled on 
the knees of half-drunken 
soldiers who emptied their 
jwine-cups, yelling for more. 



Seeking' out a small secluded table in a darker corner, 
the big barbarian sat down 
upon a creaking chair and ordered a tankard of beer. Suiting his thirst in gulps, he 
looked around. A pair of 
drunken lancers were wrestling on the f 1 oor amid shrieks 
and titters from the women. A 
game of dice was in progress 
at a neighboring table. The 
C : rrm;rian re 1 axed. 

"What about a drink, you 
si'ent dullard?'' 

With a crash of overturned 
chairs, a giant man-at-arms 
pushed thr-ugh the throng, 
leaving a train of furious 
curses in his wake. He flung 
himself down upon the unoccupied seat at Conan's table. His eyes were glassily 
betHgeremt, and his gilded 
mail and si'ken sash were 
splashed with wine from his 
cup. 

Conan's eyes narrowed. The 

man were the scarlet mantle 
and white turban oE the Imperial Giards, The turban 
sported a peacock-feather, 
the emblem of a captain of 
these elite troops. 

No doubt he belonged to 
that detachment that routed 
the Zuagirs and took Yin 
Alia! prisoner. 

With a show of bluff intimacy, the big Cimmerian leaned 
forward, his face still hidden 
in the shadow of his kaffia. 
"Do not wonder that I find 
this place dull. I came in 
only to slake my thirst." He 
gave the soldier a friendly 



i 



28 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



punch in the shoulder. "I'm 
on my way to a pleasure-house 
where the women are so fair 
and skilled as to rival the 
courtezans of Shadizar!" 

The captain hiccuped, shook 
his head, and focused his 
eyes with an effort. "Huh? 
Women? Good idea. Who are 
you, anyway?" 

"Hotep of Khemi, bodyguard to the merchant Zebah. 
Come along with me, man! A 
visit to this place will surfeit 
you for a month." 

Conan was not an expert 
dissembler. His performance 
would have aroused the suspicion of a shrewd and sober 
man. However, the drunken 
stupor of the Turanian left 
room for nothing but his most 
primitive instincts. Breathing hard, he leaned forward 
with a loud belch, staring 
blearily at Conan. 

"Lead me there, man! I 
have wandered too long over 
the cursed desert without a 
woman." 

"Were you with the party 
that ambushed the Zuagirs?" 

"With them? I commanded 
them !" 

"Good for you !" 

"Aye ; that was a noble 
fight. But the only wench in 
the caravan was the yedka 
Thanara, may the gods smite 
her haughty body with boils!" 

"She refused you?" 

"Worse! She slapped me 
when I tried-to kiss her in her 
tent!" 

"The insolence of her!" 
said Conan. 



"Nor was that all. Would 
you believe it, she threatened 
to have me flayed in the 
great square of Aghrapur if I 
did not behave? Me, Ardashir 
of Akif! Behave myself! As 
if any red-blooded man could 
control himself when casting 
his eyes upon her !" 

"It is shameful, how women 
treat us." 

"Enough of that. Lead me 
to your pleasure-house, Stygian. I need forgetfulness and 
surcease." 

Rising unsteadily, the Turanian pushed through the 
throng. Conan followed. In 
the street, the cool night air 
was like a slap in the face 
with a wet cloth. The captain sobered visibly as he 
walked. Suddenly curious, he 
peered at the half-hidden face 
of his companion, who hurried silently at his side. 

"Ho," he said, "wait a moment, my fleet-footed friend ! 
You have not described the 
whereabouts of this magical 
bouse of women, of which 
I have never heard though I 
know Wakla well. Let's have 
a look under your headsheet—" 

Ardashir's speech was cut 
short by a powerful hand on 
his throat. Normally accounted the strongest man 
in his company, he was, in 
his unsteady condition, helpless against the suddenness 
of the assault and the gorilla-like power of the Cimmerian. 

He was swiftly dragged

nara of Maypur lounged on a 
silken divan, nibbling fruit 
from a low table that stood 
on the thick rug in front of 
her couch. Her sheerly 
transparent gown revealed 
her seductive charms, but the 
man in the room paid scant 
attention to these. 

This man was a small 
bandy-legged and mud-co'ored 
fellow clad in skins and furs. 
His flat, wrinkled, monkeylike face was painted with 
stripes and circles of red and 
black. His long black hair 
was gathered in greasy 
braids, and a necklace of human teeth encircled his neck. 
A powerful stench of sweatsoaked leather and unwashed 
human hide rose from him. 
He was a Wigur, one of those 
fierce and barbarous nomads 
from the far northeast beyond the Sea of Vilayet. 

The little man sat crosslegged on the floor and 
stared at the thin curl of 
smoke that rose from a brazier on a tripod in front of 
him. The wavering blue column soared up from its source 
for two feet, then rippled and 
curled up on itself in interwoven arabesques. All the 
while the man kept up a 
swift tapping of his fingertips against a small drum, less 
than a foot across, which he 
held in his other hand. 

At least the staccato tapping stopped. 

"What see you, Tatur?" 
asked the yedka. 

"He comes," said the sha


man in a high singsong voice. 
"He whom you seek is near." 

"How can he be?" said the 
lady Thanara sharply. "Veziz Shah keeps a sharp watch, 
and no such conspicuous 
rogue could gain admittance." 

"N evert heless, he approaches," whined Tatur. 
"The spirits do not lie. Unless you flee, he will soon confront you." 

"He must have entered 
Wakla is disguise," mused 
Thanara. "If he comes upon 
me, what shall I do? Will 
your master, he who is not to 
be named, give me some 
means to cope with him?" 

"It is the will of him who 
shall not be named that you 
should succeed in your mission," intoned the Wigur. He 
fumbled inside his sheepskin 
coat and brought out a small 
purple phial. 

"A drop of this in his 
wine," he said, "will render 
him like one dead for three 
days." 

"That is good. But the barbarian is wary, as we learned 
at Khanyria. Suppose he detects the drug and refuses to 
drink?" 

Tatur brought out another 
object: a small pouch of soft 
leather. "In that case, this 
will lay him low if he 
breathe it." 

"What is it?" 

"Pollen of the yellow lotus of Khitai. Use it only as 
a last resort. For, should a 
breath of air blow it back 
upon you, you too will be 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



31 



cast into a swoon." 

"That is good, but not 
enough. If your master really 
expects me to confront the 
Cimmerian, he should furnish me with a Isst-minute 
means of escape if I am 
trapped. And your master can 
do it, and he owes it to me 
for prst services." 

A faint smile creased Tatur's wrinkled features. "He 
who is not to be named said 
tr^y you are a sharp bargainer. Here." He brought out an 
object like a translucent egg. 
"Break this in your hour of 
need, and help will come to 
you from other dimensions." 

Thanara examined the three 
objects. "Good," she said at 
last. "Ride to Aghrapur and 
tell the king I await Conan 
here. If all goes well, he shall 
have his enemy. If not, he 
will need a new agent. Haste 
and farewell!" 

A few minutes later, Tatur 
the shaman, astride a small 
shaggy Hyrkanian pony, 
jogged off into the night 
across the sands at a tireless 
canter. 

The night was cool and 
quiet. The captain cf the 
watch at the main gate 
stretched and yawned. From 
the small guard-house in the 
square before the gate he 
could see two bowmen patrolling the parapet over the big 
twin doors. The pair of spearmen at the pillars flanking 
the entrance stood erect and 
still, the moonlight reflected 



by their polished mail-shirts 
and spired helmets. No need 
to fear anything; a stroke on 
the gong at his side would 
bring a company on the double from the barracks. Nevertheless, the governor had ordered the guards doubled and 
their vigilance increased. 

The officer wondered. Did 
Veziz Shah really fear an attack on the fort on account 
of the captured Zuagir chief? 
Let the desert rats come! 
They would smash their 
heads against the walls while 
the archers riddled them with 
arrows. 

The moon was obscured 
by clouds. Akeb Man blinked 
and peered. What bad happened ? It seemed as if the two 
archers on the wall had sat 
down for a moment. Now, 
however, they had risen 
again and resumed their 
measured pacing. Better investigate these lazy devils. 

Rising, he gazed out again 
before the opening the 
door. At that instant the 
moonlight returned in full 
force. A shocking sight met 
his eyes. Instead of spired 
helmets and mantles, tr-e archers wore banded kaffias and 
khalats. 

Zuagirs ! 

How thev had "gotten in, 
only the devils knew. Akeb 
Man snatched at the hammer 
that hung beside the gong to 
Strike the alarm. 

The door of the guardhouse burst in with a crash 
and fell in a cloud of splin


FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



ters and dust. Akeb Man 
wheeled and snatched at his 
scimitar, but the sight of the 
man confronting him made 
him pause in astonishment. 
No white-clad desert raider 
was he, but a giant Western 
warrior in black mesh-mail, 
naked sword in hand. 

With a cry of fear and 
rage, the Turanian lashed 
out with a low disemboweling 
thrust. With the swiftness of 
lightning, the mailed giant 
avoided the blade and brought 
his own long straight sword 
down in a whistling blow. 
Blood spurted like a fountain as Akeb Man sank to the 
■floor, cloven to the breastbone. 

Conan wasted no time in 
gloating. The big ironsheathed doors were now 
opening, and through them 
poured a swift and silentfooted stream of white-robed 
nomads. 

Swiftly, Ccnan issued his 
orders. His tones were low, 
but the words carried to the 
ears of all. 

"Two men with torches, set 
the barracks afire. Three 
hundred archers with plenty 
of arrows place themselves to 
mow down the soldiers as 
they pour out. The rest of 
you, hit the fort with torch 
and sword. Do not break up 
into bands smaller than twenty. Thabit, bring your fifty 
with me. I am for the governor's palace." 

With an imperious gesture, 
Conan dismissed his sub


chiefs and beckoned his fifty, 
who followed his long strides 
at a dog-trot. Behind them, 
smoking torches lit the square 
as the arsonists slunk towards the guardsmen's lodgings. Other bands vanished 
in different directions. The 
lean reavers licked their lips 
in anticipation of plunder and 
vengeance as they stalked 
along the silent streets, arrows nocked and knives and 
spears gleaming in the moonlight. 

Conan led his men straight 
towards their goal. He intended to save Yin Allal 
first. Moreover, he was intrigued by the tale of the 
beautiful yedka. Here, he 
thought, he might find a 
prize precious enough to satisfy his own taste. He increased his speed, watching 
the dimmed doorways and 
n i g h t e d lane-mouths with 
smoldering eyes as he hurried past 

As they emerged upon the 
central square, Conan 
mouthed a barbaric oath. 
Four sentries paced in pairs 
before the copper door of the 
residence. He had counted on 
taking the governor by surprise, but that was no longer 
possible. Swinging his great 
sword, he raced across the 
flagstones of the marketplace. Such was his speed 
that one of the spearmen waa 
down with his side caved in 
before the others collected 
their shattered wits. 

Two spearmen thrust their 



COM AN THIP 

weapons against his broad 
breast, while the third put a 
horn to his lips and sent 
forth a bellowing signal. 
This was cut short by a wellaimed Zuagir arrow, which 
pierced the trumpeter's brain. 

Conan parried the spearthrusts with a fierce swipe of 
his sword that sheared off 
the heads of both weapons. 
With a vicious thrust he impaled one antagonist on his 
long blade. The Turanian 
fell sprawling against the 
other with a gurgle. The second man's sword-stroke at 
the Cimmerian's head went 
awry and struck sparks from 
the flagstones. In the next 
instant, the man was pincushioned with arrows. Witk a 
groan and a clatter of mail he 
fell. 

Conan sprang forward and 
tried the copper door. In answer to the ringing note of 
the horn, people thrust their 
heads out of casements around 
the square. Archers appeared 
on seme of the roofs; he 
must get into the tower before the foe had time to organize a defense. 

The door opened before his 
thrusting shoulder. Leaving 
ten of his men to guard 
against attack from the rear, 
Conan led the rest inside. 

With a clink of mall and a 
flash of sword-blades, ten 
soldiers in the white turbans 
of the Imperial Guard rushed 
against him out of a doorway. The Cimmerian's battlecry rang high as he and his 



'ICTORIOUS 33 

followers closed wlJn th-lr 
enemies. Many a curved 
knife or shortened spear 
found its mark in Turanian 
vitals, but the flashing scimitars also took a heavy toll. 
However, the bloodiest havoc 
wreaked was that of Conan's 
cross-hilled sword. In a couple of minutes, the ten Turanians lay in pools of blood, 
though eight silent figures hi 
bloodstained khalats bore witness to the ferocity of the 
defense. 

Conan swept up to the second floor, taking four steps 
at a stride. Pausing, he flung 
swift orders at his followers. 

"Ten of you, search for the 
keys to the dungeon and free 
Yin Allal. The rest, take all 
the plunder you can carry. 
I'll pay the governor a visit." 

As the Zuagirs, howling 
and laughing, stormed up and 
down the stairs, Conan broke 
the sandalwood door before 
him into splinters with a 
mighty kick. He found himself in the anteroom of the 
governor's apartments. Crossing the floor sv/iftly on 
s o u n d-deadening mats, he 
halted in mid-step. From the 
other side of the door before 
him he heard a woman's voice 
raised in angry expostulation. 

Conan's brows drew together in a vast frown. He 
picked up a heavy table and 
heaved it against the new obstacle. With a crashing impact the ungainly missile 
burst open the shattered 



34 FANTASTI" 

door. Ke tossed the remains 
of the table aside and strode 
through. 

At a table in the middle of 
the lamplit room stood a tall, 
powerful man of middle age. 
Conan knew him by description as Veziz Shah. Silken 
divans and tables laden with 
delicacies stood about on the 
rug-covered floor. On one 
table rested a flagon of wine 
with two filled goblets. 

A woman rested on the divan. Her sheer silken gown 
revealed her charms. Conan 
gave a start. Th ; s was the 
girl who had accosted him 
in Khanyria and almost led 
him to his death! 

No time now to mull over 
such matters. With a curse, 
the governor unsheathed his 
jeweled scimitar and advanced catliice upon the Cimmerian. 

"You dare invade my chambers, you red-handed rogue !" 
he snarled. "I have heard you 
are on the rove again, and I 
hoped for the pleasure of 
having your limbs torn off 
by wild horses. But as it is — " 

He whipped forward in a 
swift arching stroke. Most 
men would have been so dis-„ 
tracted by his words as to 
have their throats slit by that 
whistling edge, but the 
pantherish speed of barbarian 
muscles saved Conan. Parrying with his hilt, he lashed 
out in a vicious counter-cut. 
In the exchange of blows and 
thrusts he- soon found he 
faced one of the most skilled 



: UNIVERSE 

swordsmen he had ever met. 

But no civilized fencer 
could match the skill and 
speed of Conan, hardened in 
wars and battles since boyhood against foes from all 
over the world. The skill at 
arms he had won as a mercenary would by itse'f have 
mace him master of any ordinary swordsman, for his 
learn 'ng had been pounded 
into his brain in endless, 
bloody strife on far battlefields. 

As the duel continued, 
Veziz Shah began to tire and 
his eyes filled with an awful 
fear. With a sudden cry he 
flung his scimitar into Conan's face and raced for the 
far wall. There his questing 
fingers probed the surface as 
if seeking the spring to open 
a hidden exit. 

Conan avoided the missile 
with a jerk of his biackmaned head. The next second hb arm was around the 
neck and his knee in the back 
of the Turanian emir. His 
voice was a terrible whisper 
in Ye-iz Shah's ear. 

"Dog, remember when you 
caught ten of my Afghulis 
when you commanded a 
squadron in Secundcram? 
And now you sent me their 
pickled heads in jars with 
wishes for a hearty repast? 
Your time has come. Rot in 
he'.lT 

With a terrible heave, the 
blood-mad Cimmerian forced 
his enemy's body backwards 
against the thrust of his knee 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



35 



until the Turanian's spine 
snapped like a dry twig. A 
lifeless corpse flopped to the 
floor. Sweating and panting, 
Conan turned to the woman 
on the divan. 

Thanara had not moved 
during the fight. Now she 
rose, her supple body outlined through her silken 
nightgown. Eyes shining, she 
raised her arms and came 
fearlessly towards Conan, ignoring the bloody sword in 
his hand. 

"You are a real man !" she 
whispered, pressing herself 
against his rough mail and 
twining her arms around his 
corded neck. "None other 
could have slain Veziz Shah. 
I am glad you did. Ke forced 
me by threats to come in here 
to do his bidding. I have 
nothing against loving a man, 
but I wish to do it of my own 
accord. Share my couch, barbarian!" 

Conan felt the hot urge of 
his racing blood. In his 
younger days he would have 
swept the woman into his 
arms and damned the consequences. But now the caution of long experience asserted itself. 

"You were clad otherwise 
when we met in Khanyria," 
he said, taking both her 
wrists in one big paw and 
drawing her firmly down to 
the couch beside him. "Tell 
me the tale behind that ambush, and your part in it. No 
lies, now, if you know what's 
good for you!" 



The dark eyes -under the 
long lashes regarded him 
without fear. A well-formed 
hand gently drew itself from 
his grasp and took one of the 
goblets of wine from the table. She handed him this vessel and began sipping the 
other herself. 

"You must be thirsty after 
killing. Have a draught of 
this wine. Drink, and I will 
tell you the story you ask 
for." 

Conan stared into the 
depths of the cup as Thanara's 
musical voice began: "I am 
Thanara, a yedka or highborn lady of Maypur. King 
Yezdigerd has graciously appointed me one of his personal agents — the eyes and ears 
of the king, as we call them 
in Turan. When word came 
that you had embarked on 
your lonely journey, I v/as 
sent to supervise the work of 
the stupid mercenaries engaged by our agent in Tarantia. I suppose — " 

Conan hurled his cup to 
the floor and furiously 
turned upon the woman. He 
had sniffed the wine and let 
a little touch his tongue, and 
his keen barbarian senses 
told him of the threat that 
lurked in the cup. One huge 
hand fastened itself in her 
long black hair. 

"I'll supervise you, strumpet!" he snarled. "I 
thought — " 

Thanara's hand came up 
from behind her and flung 
into his face a pinch of the 



36 FANTASTI 

pollen of the yellow lotus. 
Conan jerked back, coughing 
End sneezing, and let go 
Thanara's hair. Holding her 
breath, she slipped out of his 
reach and stood up. 

Snoring heavily, Conan 
sprawled upon the couch. 

Thanara nodded in satisfaction. For the nc::t two or 
three days he would be like 
a man stone dead. 

A rising murmur from 
without attracted her attention. She stepped to a window overlooking the square 
and pulled back the curtains. 
At the sight she saw she 
jerked back. Houses flamed, 
fired by the ravaging Zuagir 
horde. Shrieks of captive 
women and curses of battling 
mm echoed. White ghostly 
shapes flitted here and there. 
Evidently Conan had entered 
the fort, not alone as she had 
thought, but in the company 
of the desert wolves. 

Swiftly s he collected her 
wits, She grabbed a white 
robe from one of the chests 
and donned it. She armed 
herself with a lonr^ goldhilted dagger. Thrusting 
aside the broken and staring 
corpse of the lp.te governor, 
she searched with swift 
hands for the spring activating the secret door. 

With a grating sound, a 
section of the wall swung inward, disclosing a spiral 
staircase le?ding downwards. 
She went back to the couch 



: UNIVERSE 

where the unconscious form 
of Conan rested. Grasping 
hirn beneath the armpits, she 
dragged him inside the secret 
door, straining her muscles to 
the utmost to move his great 
weight. She worked the 
spring from inside to close 
the door and laid the Cimmerian to rest on the steps. 

Thanara hurried down the 
steps. Light came faintly 
from several narrow windowslits. On the ground floor she 
found herself in a small circular chamber. The exit 
worked in the same way as 
the entrance to the hidden 
passage. She pressed the stud 
and slipped out, taking good 
no^e of the means of reentry. 

The fort was a hell. The 
Zuagirs had broken out the 
contents of the wine-cellars 
and gotten swiftly drunk. 
Their laughing torchmsn had 
set fire to every house. 
Bands of captive women 
were rounded up and herded, 
with whiplash**? and coarse 
jests, towards the main gate. 

At the barracks the slaughter had been awful. The cornered soldiers rushing out 
through the only exit, had 
run into a hail of arrows 
from the waiting Zuz^ir archers. Hundreds of pincushioned bodies lay in heaps 
about the ruins of the barracks, while charred bodies 
in the debris showed that 
many had been caught by the 
flames before they could win 
out the door to face the arrows. 



COM AM TIIG 

Among the inner buildings 
of the sort, bancs of bloodmad nomads were still cutting down the remnanto of 
the company of the Imperial 
Guard who, awakened by the 
noise, burst out of their scattered lodgings. 

Hardened to a life of ravr 
experience, Thetmra hurried 
through the dark streets. The 
way was lit only by the guttering flames of burning 
houses. Unfrightened by the 
corpses choking the gutters, 
she melted into dark doorways whenever a screaming 
Zuagir band shuffled by, 
swinging golden spoils and 
herding captive women. 
When passing the mouth of 
a. s:nall lane, she heard a gut* 
g 1 ;. She peered swiftly into 
the gloom and discerned a 
prostrate figure. She also saw 
that it wore the spired helmet and fine-meshed mail 
coif of a Turanian Imperial 
Guard. 

Hurrying into the narrow 
space, she bent and removed 
the gag from the man's 
mouth. She at once recognized 
Ardashir of Akif, half suffocated by the smoke of nearby 
fires but otherwise very much 
alive. 

She cut his bonds and motioned him to rise and follow 
her. With the habits of an old 
soldier, he accepted her leadership without argument. 

The journey back to the 
governor's palace was uneventful. The drunken bands 
seemed «a*»«l ft *e:d with their 



VICTORIOUS . 37 

spoils and were drawing back 
out of the fort. Once, however, the Turanians were 
confronted by a pair of leering drunken desert raiders, 
but the Zuagirs CQVid not 
match the swift strokes cf 
Aruacliir's scimitar by clumsy motions with their curved 
knives. Leaving their bloodied bodies behind, the couple 
won unscathed to the tower. 
They slipped into the secret 
entrance. Ardashir followed 
unwillingly as Thanara led 
the way up the stairs to 
where Conan lay. 

Recognizing his foe, Ardashir snatched at his scimitar with an oath. Thanara 
caught his arm. "Calm yourself ! Know you not that the 
king will shower us with 
gold if we bring the barbarian to him alive?" 

Ardashir made a pungent 
suggestion as to what King 
Yeziigerd could do with his 
gold. "The swine has 
smirched my honor !" lie 
shouted. "I will—" 

"Hold your tongue, fool! 
What will happen to you 
when the king learns ycu 
have lost a whole company of 
his precious Imperials but escaped without a scratch yourself?" 

"Htn," said Ardashir, h's 
fury abating and giving way 
to calculation. Thanara continued : 

"The king's most skilled 
executioners will have to 
meet in conclave to invent 
sufferings hellish enough to 



33 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



atone for the trouble he has 
given Turan. Take bold of 
your senses. Will you forsake wealth and a generalship for a moment of personal vengeance?" 

Growling but quieted, Ardashir sheathed his sword and 
helped the girl to tie the barbarian's hands and feet. She 
whispered : 

"We shall wait until dawn. 
By then the Zuagir bands 
will have left, and we shall 
take horses from some stable. 
The drunken raiders must 
have overlooked some. If we 
spur hard, we can be out of 
danger in half a day. We 
shall ride straight for the 
capital and drug our prisoner anew during the journey 
to keep him quiet. In five 
days he shall lie in the king's 
deepest dungeon in Aghrapur!" 

3. THE PALACE ON THE 
CLIFF. 

With head whirling, stomach knotted with nausea, and 
throat parched, Conan the 
Cimmerian slowly regained 
his senses. His last memory 
was of sitting on the sumptuous couch of Veziz Shah, 
governor of Fort Wakla. 
Now he found himself gazing 
at dank dripping walls, with 
the squeak of scuttling rats 
in his ears as he turned heavily over to sit up on a bed of 
moldy straw. As he moved, 
there was a jingle of heavy 
chains linking the fetters on 



his wrists and ankles with a 
massive bronze staple set in 
the wall. He was naked but 
for a loin-cloth. 

His head felt as if it were 
goin ; -< to split. His tongue 
stuck to his palate with 
thirst, and intense p?ngs of 
hunger assailed him. In spite 
of the shooting pains in his 
skull, he raised his voice in 
a mighty bellow. 

'Ho, guards! Would you 
let a man perish of hunger 
and thirst? Fetch food and 
drink ! What cursed nook of 
Hell is this?" 

With a patter of footsteps 
and jingle of keys, a paunchy 
bearded jailer appeared on 
the other side of the iron 
grille that barret the door of 
the cell. "So the Western dog 
has awakened! Know that 
these are the dungeons of 
King Yezdigerd's palace at 
Aghrapur. Here is food and 
water. You will need to fill 
your belly to appreciate the 
cordial reception the king 
has prepared for ycu." 

Thrusting a loaf and a 
small jug through the bars, 
the jailer went away, hi9 
cackling laughter resounding 
hollowly in the corridor. The 
famished Cimmerian flung 
himself on the food and 
drink. He munched great 
hunks of the stale loaf and 
washed them down with 
gulps of water. 

He pondered his predicament. He was in the hands 
of his most implacable enemy. In the oWen days King 



COHAN THE 

Yezdigerd had offered fabulous rewards for Conan's 
head. Many had been the attempts on Conan. But the 
tenacious hatred in Yezdigerd's heart had not slackened even when his foe had 
won power as king of far 
Aquilonia. Now, by a woman's devious schemes, Conan 
was at last at the mercy of 
his merciless antagonist. Any 
ordinary man would have 
been daunted by the terrible 
prospect. 

Not so Conan! Accepting 
things as they were, his fertile mind was already tryng 
and discarding plans of winning to freedom and turning 
the tables on his vengeful 
captor. His eyes narrowed as 
the clank of footsteps sounded in the corridor. 

At a harsh word of command the steps halted. 
Through the grille Conan 
could discern a half-score of 
guardsmen, gilt-worked mail 
a-shimmer in the torchlight, 
curved swords in their hands. 
Two bore heavy bows at the 
ready. A tall massive officer 
Stood forward. Conan recognized Ardashir, who spoke 
in a sharp cutting voice. 

"Shaptir and V a r d a n ! 
Truss the barbarian securely 
and sling a noose about his 
neck! Archers! Stand by to 
prevent any trick!" 

The two soldiers stepped 
forward to carry out the order. One bore a log of wood 
six feet long and several 
inches thick, while the other 



VICTORIOUS 39 

carried a stout rope. Ardashir 
addressed himself to the Cimmerian. His eyes glowed with 
malevolence and his fingers 
twitched with eagerness to 
attack Conan, but he himself 
in check with the iron selfcontrol of a well-trained officer. He hissed: 

"One false move, barbarian dog, and your heart shall 
know the marksmanship of 
my archers! I should dearly 
love to slay you myself, but 
you are the king's own 
meat." 

Conan's chill blue eyes regarded the maddened officer 
without emotion as the soldiers placed the log across 
his shoulders and bound his 
arms to it. Without apparent 
effort, Conan tensed his huge 
arm-muscles, so that the rope 
v/as stretched to its greatest 
tautness at the moment of tying. The jailer then unlocked 
Conan's fetters. Conan rumbled: 

"You Turanian dogs will 
get what you deserve sooner 
or later. You will see." 

Ardashu's face twitched in 
fury as he spat back: "And 
you will get yours, you redhanded rogue ! No torture devised by human brains will 
be too cruel when the royal 
executioners set to work 
upon you. But enough of this 
gabble. Follow me, your majesty of maggoty Aquilonia!" 

At a gesture to the guardsmen, the little company 
marched along the dark corridors. The bound barbarian 



40 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



walked in their midst, bearing the log across his shoulders. Conan was quite unruffled. He was like a trapped 
wolf, alert and constantly 
looking for a chance to reverse the situation. He did 
not waste thought on the terrible odds against him, or on 
futile recriminations against 
his foes, or on self-reproach 
for the moment's lapse in vigilance that resulted in his 
capture. His whole mind and 
nervous system were concentrated on what to do next. 

Winding stone staircases 
led upward. As nobody had 
blindfolded Conan, his keen 
eyes took in every detail. The 
dungeons of the royal palace 
were far below ground-level. 
There were several floors to 
passTwice Conan glimpsed the 
outside world as they passed 
window-slits. The darkling 
sky showed that the time was 
either dawn or dusk. Now he 
understood the mystifying 
murmur of surf which had 
reached his ears. The palace 
was built on the outskirts of 
Aghrapur, on a crag overlooking the Sea of Vilayet. 
The dungeons were carved 
out of the heart of the rock 
whose sheer face ended in 
the lapping waves below. 
That was why Conan could 
see the sky through the window-slits, though they had 
not yet reached the lower 
floors of the palace itself. 

The size of the palace was 
amazing. The party passed 



through endless roonns with 
fountains and jeweled vases. 
Now their steps echoed from 
arching walls ; now they were 
muffled by rich rugs and 
hangings. Corseleted soldiers 
stood like statues everywhere. 

The party halted before 
two gigantic gold-worked 
doors. Fully fifty feet high 
they towered, their upper 
parts disappearing in * the 
gloom. Mysterious arabesques 
curled their snaky course 
across the surfaces of the 
doors, on which the dragons, 
heroes, and wizards of Hyrkanian legend were depicted. 
Ardashir stepped forward and 
struck the golden plates a 
ringing blow with the hilt of 
his scimitar. 

In response, the immense 
doors opened slowly. The low 
murmur of a great a t ssemb 1 y 
of people reached Conan's 
ears. 

The throne-room was vaster than anything Conan had 
ever seen, fremthe sumptuous state chambers of ODliir 
and Nemedia to the smoky, 
timber-roofed halls of Aspard 
and Vanaheim. Giant pillars 
of marble reared lofty columns towards a roof that 
seemed as distant as the sky. 
The profusion of cressets, 
lamps, and candelabra illuminated costly drapes, paintings, and hangings. Behind 
the throne rose windows of 
stained glass, closed against 
the fall of night. 

A glittering host filled the 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



41 



hall. Fully a thousand must 
have assembled there. There 
were Nemedians in jupons, 
trunk-hose, and great leather 
boots; Ophireans in billowing 
cloaks; stocky black-bearded 
Shemites in silken robes; renegade Zuagirs from the desert; Vendhyans in bulging 
turbans and gauzy robes; 
barbarically-clad emissaries 
from the black kingdoms to 
the far southwest. Even a 
lone yellow-haired warrior 
from the Far North, clad in 
a somber black tunic, stared 
sullenly before him, his powerful hands gripping the hilt 
of a heavy longsword that 
rested before him with the 
chape of its scabbard on the 
floor. 

Some had come here to escape the wrath of their own 
rulers, some as informers and 
traitors against the lands of 
their birth, and some as envoys. 

The blare of golden trumpets rang across the huge 
hall. An avenue opened 
through the milling mass, and 
Conan's little group set itself 
again in motion. 

Conan was afire with curiosity. Though he had fought 
this Eastern despot many 
years ago on several occasions — as war-chief of the 
Zuagirs, as admiral of t" Vilayet pirates, as leader . . 
the Himelian hillmen, and as 
hetman of the kozaki — he had 
never yet seen his implacable 
foe in person. He kept his 
eyes full on the figure on 



the golden throne as he approached it. 

So it came about that he 
did not notice the widening 
of the blond giant's gray 
eyes in sudden recognition. 
The powerful knuckles whitened as the enigmatic gaze 
intently followed the towering figure of the Cimmerian 
on his way towards the dais. 

King Yezdigerd was a 
swarthy giant of a man with 
a short black beard and a thin 
cruel mouth. Although the 
debauchery of the Turanian 
court had wrought pouches 
under his glittering eyes, and 
lines criss-crossed his stern 
and gloomy features ten 
years too early, his hardmuscled, powerful body bore 
witness that self-indulgence 
had not sapped his immense 
vitality. 

A brilliant strategist and 
an insatiable plunderer, Yezdigerd had more than doubled 
the size of the kingom inherited from his weak predecessor Yildiz. He had 
wrung tribute from the citystates of Brythunia and eastern Shem. His gleaming 
horsemen had beaten the 
armies of such distant nations as Stygia and Hyperborea. The crafty king of 
Zamora, Mithridates, had 
been shorn of border provinces and had kept his throne 
only at the price of groveling 
before his conqueror. 

Arrayed i~< a splendor of 
silk and r loth-of-gold. the

FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



throne with the deceptive 
ease of a resting panther. 

At his right sat a woman. 
Conan felt his blood run hot 
with recognition. Thanara! 
A diamond-studded diadem 
glittered in her lustrous black 
hair. Her eyes fastened triumphantly on the trussed 
and weaponless figure of her 
captive. She joined in the 
laughter of the courtiers 
round the throne at some 
grim jest uttered by the 
king. 

The detail halted before 
the throne. Yezdigerd's eyes 
blazed with triumphant glee. 
At last he held in his power 
the man whq had slaughtered 
his soldiers, burnt his cities, 
and scuttled his ships. The 
lust for vengeance churned up 
within him, but he held himself in check while the 
guardsmen knelt and touched 
their foreheads to the marble 
floor. 

Conan made no obeisance. 
His blue eyes aflame with icy 
fire, he stood still and upright, clashing with the Turanian king in a battle of 
looks. Unclad, as he was, he 
still commanded the attsntion 
of all by the aura of power 
that radiated from him. The 
rumor of his fabulous exploits 
was whispered back and forth 
among the members of the 
glittering throng. 

Sensing the strain upon the 
rope he held, Ardashir looked 
up from his kneeling posture. 
Black ra<*e seethed in his face 
as he sew the disdain of the 



Cimmerian for court etiquette. He tugged viciously 
at the rope, tightening the 
noose about Conan's neck. 
Conan stood steady as a rock. 
The massive muscles of his 
bull-neck swelled in ridges 
against the pressure of the 
rope. Then he suddenly bent 
forward and straightened up 
again, pulling the rope backwards. Ardashir was jerked 
off his knees and sprawled 
with a clatter of gear on the 
marble. 

"I pay homage to no Hyrkanian dog!" Conan's roar was 
like a peal of thunder. "You 
wage your wars with the help 
of women. Can you handle a 
sword yourself? I'll show you 
how a real man fights!" 

During his short speech, 
Conan relaxed the taut muscles of his arms, so that the 
rope binding them went slack. 
By stretching, he got the tips 
of his left fingers around one 
end of the log on his back. 
With a quick jerk he slipped 
his right arm out of the loose 
coils of rope and brought the 
log around in front of him. 
Then he swiftly freed his left 
arm. 

Ardashir scrambled up and 
lunged towards him, drawing 
his scimitar. Conan whipped 
the end of the log around with 
a thud against the Turanian's 
helmet. The officer was 
hurled across the floor, his 
body spinning like that of a 
thrown doll. 

For a split second, everybody stood unmoving, struck 



COHAN THE VICTORIOUS 



A3 



still by this seemingly magical feat. With the fighting 
instinct of the barbarian, Conan took instant advantage of 
this pau:e. One end of the log 
shot out and caught a guardsman in the face. The man 
flew over backwards, his face 
a mere smear of blood and 
broken bones. Then Conan 
whirled and threw the log into 
the nearest group of guards 
on the other side of him, even 
as they started to rise and 
drew their weapons. The men 
were bowled over in a clattering heap. 

Lithe and quick as a leopard, Conan bounded forward, 
snatching up the scimitar 
that Ardashir had dropped 
when knocked unconscious. 
A couple of courtiers tried to 
bar the Cimmerian's way at 
the foot of King Yezdigerd's 
dais, but he easily cut his 
path through them, slashing 
and thrusting. He bounded up 
the steps of the dais. 

As he came, the king rose 
to meet him, sweeping cut his 
own scimitar. The jewels in 
its hilt flashed as Yezdigerd 
brought the blade up to parry 
a terrific downright cut that 
Conan aimed at his head. 
Such was the force of the blow 
that the king's sword snapped. 
Conan's blade cut through the 
many folds of the snowwhite turban, cleaving the 
spray of bird-of-paradise 
feathers that rose from the 
front of it and denting the 
steel cap that Yesdigerd wore 
beneath. 



Though the blow failed to 
split the king's skull as Conan intended, it threw the 
Turanian backwards, stunned. 
Yezdigerd fell back over the 
arm of his throne and overset 
the gleaming chair. King and 
throne rolled off the dais, 
down the steps on the other 
side, and into a knot of onrushing guardsmen, spoiling 
their charge. 

Conan, beside himself with 
battle-lust, would have bounded after the king to finish 
him off. But loyal arms 
dragged Yezdigerd out of the 
press, and from all sides 
sword-blades and spear-points 
pressed in upon the unprotected Cimmerian. 

Conan's scimitar wove a 
lethal net of steel around him. 
He surpassed himself in brilliant swordsmanship. Despite 
his stay in the dungeon and 
the after-effects of the drug 
he had inhaled, he was fired 
with vitality. 

A quick slash sent an antagonist tumbling backwards 
with his entrails spilling out; 
a lightning thrust burst 
through mail-links into a 
Turanian heart. For an instant, raging like a mad elephant about the dais, he 
cleared it of soldiers and 
courtiers except for those who 
lay in a tangle about his feet. 

Only the lady Thanara remained, sitting petrified in 
her chair. With a grating 
laugh, Conan tore the glittering diadem from her hair 
and flung her into the throng 



4t 



FANTASTIC UHIYERSE 



that milled about the platfo - m. 

So'diers now advanced 
grim'y from all sides, tliair 
spearheads and sword-blades 
forming a bristling hedge in 
front of an ordered line of 
shields. Behind them, archers 
nocked their shafls. 

Coaan. flexed his muse'es, 
swung his scimitar, and gave 
a booming laugh. Blood ran 
down his naked hide from 
superficial cuts in scalp, a on, 
chest, and leg. Surrounded 
and unarmored, not even his 
strength and speed ould 
save him from the thrust of 
many keen blades all at once. 
The prospect of death did 
rot trouble him; he only 
hoped to take as many foes 
a? he could into the darkness 
with him. 

Suddenly there came the 
clash of steel, the spurt of 
blood, and the icy gleam of a 
northern longsword. A giant 
figure hev/ed its way through 
the armored lines, leaving 
tar -ta blood-spattered corpses 
on the floor. With a mighty 
bound, the fair-haired Northerner leaped to the dais. In 
his left arm he crr^hd a couple of heavy round obiecti — 
bucklers of br.-.r>3e and h-ather picked up from the floor 
where the victims of Corvan's 
first outburst had dropoed 
them. 

"Catch this!" cried the newcome-, tossing one of the 
shields to Co nan. Their 
glances met and locked. Conan cried: 



"Rolf! What do you here, 
old polar bear?" 

"I will tell yea later," 
g r o v/ 1 e d the Northerner, 
grasping the handle of the 
other buckler. "If we live, 
that is. If not, I am prepared 
to fight and die with you." 

The unexpected advent of 
this formidable ally raised 
Conan's spirits even higher. 

"Rush in, jackals," he taunted, waving his blood-stained 
scimitar. "Who will be the 
next to consign his scul to 
Hell?" 

The steel-sheathed ranks of 
the Turanian soldiery had 
halted, forming a square 
about the dais. The two giant 
barbarians stood back to back, 
one black-haired and almost 
naked, the other blond and 
clad in somber black. 

"Archers!" cried an officer 
directing the Turanian troopers. "Spread out, so the 
shafts shall strike from all 
sides." 

"They have us," growled 
Rolf. ""Had we but stout 
coats of Asgardean mail... 
Ah, well, it was fun while it 

a -. :ea. 

"Not quite," said Confn. 
"Cee you that row of windows ? Here is my plan..." 

He whispered a few quick 
words to his comrade, who 
nodded. The two giants 
sr. rang forward, their blades 
flickering with the speed of 
striking snakes. Two guardsmen sank to the floor in their 
blood, and the others shrank 
back momentarily from the 



COHAN THE VICTORIOUS 



<5 



ivry of the mad onslaught. 

"Follow me, Rolf! We will 
foci these dogs yet!" barked 
the Cimmerian, striking right 
and left. 

The swords of the barbarians cleared a bloody avenue. 
The big northerner wheeled, 
thrusting and cutting, his 
sword cutting down the Turanians like wheat-stalks before the scythe as he guarded 
Conan's back. As Conan 
rushed forward, Rolf followed in his wake, his sword 
widening the bloody path 
opened by the Cimmerian. His 
booming bess was casting 
forth the ringing tones of old 
Northern battlesongs, and the 
gleam of the berserk was in 
his geze. 

Turanian swords and spears 
sought their blood, but 
glanced hsrm'ecs'y from the 
shields as the panlheri-h 
speed of the barbarians 
b'urred' the eyes of their adversaries. Conan bled from a 
score of wounds and Rolfs 
garb was in tatters, but the 
bodies heaped uuon the floor 
bespoke the violence of their 
attack. 

They put their backs to one 
of the large windows. For a 
few seconds both barbarians 
exploded into maniacal fury, 
laying about them with bloodcrusted blades and clearing a 
snace of several feet around 
them. The massed soldiers 
shrank back for a moment. It 
seemed to their superstitious 
Winds as if these were not 
men but invincible ogres, 



hard as steel, risen from the 
darker realms to wreak terrible vengeance. 

Conan utilized this moment 
with lightening-like speed. 
The stained glass of the window shattered into thousands 
of gleaming many-c o 1 o r e d 
shards under blows from his 
scimitar that tore a great gap 
in the leaded pane. Hurling 
their swords and shields into 
the faces of their foes, the 
Cimmerian and the Northerner sprang through in headlong dives towards the sea 
two hundred feet below. A 
taunting laugh lingered behind them in the air as the 
guardsmen closed in. 

"Archers! An archer, qu'ekly, to have at them!"' The commanding officer's' voice was 
shrill with desperation. Five 
men stood forward, each 
armed with the powerful double-curved Hyrkanian warbow. The window-niche was 
e'eared, and soon the twang 
of cords was heard. Then one 
of the bowmen shrugged his 
Shoulders and turned to the 
officer. 

"The range is too great in 
this treacherous moonlight. 
We cannot even discern their 
herds, and probably they are 
swimming under water most 
of the time. The task is beyond u?." 

Glaring;, the general swung 
about and hurried to the 
kind's chamber. Yezdiperd 
had recovered from his shock. 
The only sign of damage was 
a small bandage round his 



46 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



forehead, partly covered by 
his turban. The terse account 
of the incidents elapsed was 
interrupted by the crash of 
the king's fist on the table, 
spilling vases and wine-jugs 
to the floor. 

"You have dared to fail! 
Are my soldiers sucklings, 
that they cannot lay two men 
low? Every tenth man among 
the guards shall die in the 
morning, to bolster the courage of the rest!" 

He continued in a lower 
voice: "See that two wargalleys are outfitted at once. 
The barbarians will surely 
try to steal a boat and make 
their way across the sea. We 
shall overtake them. See that 
the ships are well-provisioned 
and manned by my best seamen and soldiers. When I 
have caught these dogs, they 
shall suffer the agonies of a 
thousand deaths in the torture-chambers of Aghrapur." 

He laughed, animated by 
the grisly prospect, and gestured imperiously to his 
general. The latter hurried 
out, threading his way 
through the throng in the 
courtroom to carry out his 
lord's commands. 

Khosru the fisherman sat 
patiently on the gunwale of 
his sloop, mending a net 
which had been broken by the 
thrashing of a giant sturgeon 
that afternoon. He cursed his 
misfortune, for this was a 
fine net. It had cost him two 
pieces of pold and the prom


ise of fifty pounds of fish 
to the Shemite merchant 
whom he had bought it from. 
But what could the poor starving fisherman do? He must 
have nets to get his living 
from the sea. 

Aye, if those were the only 
things necessary for him and 
his family! But he must also 
strain and work to meet the 
taxes imposed by the king. 
He looked up in venomous, 
furtive hatred at the palace, 
limned against the moonlit 
sky. The king's tax-gatherers 
had supple whips and no 
compunction about using 
them. Welts and old. scars on 
Khosru's back told of wrongs 
suffered when the shoals were 
empty of fish. 

Suddenly the sloop heaved, 
almost unseating him. Khosru 
sprang up, his eyes starting 
from their sockets in terror. 
A huge almost-naked man 
was climbing aboard, his 
black square-cut hair disordered and dripping. He 
seemed to Khosru like some 
demon of the sea, an evil merman, come up from unknown 
deeps to blast his soul and 
devour his body. 

For a moment the apparition simply sat on a thwart, 
breathing in deep gasps. Then 
it spoke in Hyrkanian, though 
with a barbarious accent. 
Khosru's terror increased as 
another figure, a huge blackclad golden-haired man with a 
broad-bladed dagger at his 
belt, followed the first ove£ 
the gunwale. 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



47 



"Fear not, sailor!" boomed 
the black-haired giant. "We 
don't want your blood, only 
your ship." He drew a glittering diadem from the waistband of his loin-cloth and 
held it out. "Here is payment 
enough and more. You can buy 
ten such craft as this one 
with it. Agreed — or — ?" 

He flexed his thick fingers 
suggestively. Khosru, his head 
whirling, nodded and 
snatched the diadem. With 
speed of a frightened mouse 
he scuttled into the dinghy 
moored to the stern of the 
sloop and rowed away at desperate speed. 

His strange customers lost 
no time. The sail went swiftly up and billowed in the 
freshening breeze. The trim 
craft gathered speed as it 
steered out towards the east. 

4, THE SEA OF BLOOD. 

The wind blew hard. Salty 
spray was tossed from the 
waves by the howling gusts. 
Conan the Cimmerian expanded his mighty chest in 
deep, joyous breathe, relishing 
the feel of freedom. Many 
memories crowded bis mind 
from the earlier days when he, 
as chief of the pirates of Vilayet, had swept the sea with 
dripping sword-b 1 ades and 
laid the Turanian seaports in 
smoking ruins. 

Vilayet was still a Hyrkanian sea, dominated by the Turanian navy's swift war-galleys. Trade was carried on to 



some extent by daring merchants from the smaller countries on the northeastern 
shore, but a merchantman's 
way across the turbulent 
waves was fraught with peril. 
No slate of war was needed 
for a Turanian captain to 
board, plunder, and scuttle a 
foreign vessel if it pleased 
him. The excuse was simply 
"infringement upon the interests of the Lord of the 
Turanian Empire." 

Besides the greedy Turanian navy, there lurked another 
danger quite as great: the pirates ! 

A motley horde of escaped 
slaves, criminals, freebooters, 
and wandering adventurers, 
all with a common lust for 
gold and a common disregard 
for human life, infested the 
waters of this huge inland 
sea, making even Turanian 
shipping a hazardous venture. 

Internal strife often crippled their power, to the satisfaction of the king of Turan, 
until there came along them a 
strange barbarian from the 
West, with blue eyes and 
raven hair. Conan swept aside 
their quarreling captains and 
took the reins of leadership 
in his own hands. He smiled 
in recollection of these days, 
when his name was a curse in 
Vilayet harbors, and prayers 
and incantations were chanted 
against him in the temples of 
the seaports. 

The sloop's sharp bow cut 
the water like a scimitar, and 
her single sail billowed taut


FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



ly before the wind. Aghrapur 
had been astern for neai Ly 
twenty hours. Conan guessed 
their speed to be greater than 
that of Turanian warships. 
Should the breeze die, however, they would have a problem. They could never hope 
to equal the speed of a galley, 
propelled by hard-driven slave 
rowers, by means of their 
own puny sweeps. But the 
wind showed no sign of 
slackening, and Rolf's capable 
hand guided the small vessel 
before it so as to extract the 
last ounce of sail-power from 
it. 

Rolf was telling the long 
tale of the wanderings and 
adventures that had led him 
to Aghrapur. "...so here I 
am, a fugitive from my native 
Asgard and from Turan both."' 

"Why did you join me?" 
asked Conan. "You were comfortably off at the Turanian 
court." 

Rolf looked offended. "Did 
you think I had forgotten the 
time you saved my life, in 
that battle with the Hyperboreans in the Graaskal 
Mountains ?" 

Conan grinned. "So I did, 
didn't I? After so many 
battles, I had forgotten myself." He shaded his eyes and 
looked at the unbroken blue 
line of the horizon. "I 
doubt not that at least a couple of Yezdigerd's war-galleys 
are on our heels," he said 
grimly. "The rascal must be 
hot for, vengeance. I doubt he 
will soon forget how thor


oughly we pulled his beaLd." 

'True," rumbled Rolf. "I 
hope this fine wind keeps up, 
or we shall soon be at gr'.ps 
with his galleys." 

Conan's active mind was already dwelling on another 
topic. "In my days with the 
Red Brotherhood," he mused, 
"this area was the surest one 
for a sweep to catch a fat 
merchantman from Sultanapur or Khawariztn. Some of 
the pirate ships should be 
nearby." 

He stiffened like a lion 
sighting its prey and out an 
arm to starboard. 

"Rolf, we ha^e company! 
Those yellow sails can mean 
but one thing: a pirate. We 
might as well drop our sail 
and await them; they could 
overtake us in a half -hour if 
they wished!" 

Eyes fixed on the oncoming 
vessels, he waited, outword'y 
stolid and unmoved. 

Conan drank in the measured thump of oars in their 
locks, the creak of spars, the 
shouts of boatswains, and 
the smell of tar with gusto. 
Half a cable's length away 
a slim sailing-galley, its yellow sail ablaze in the afternoon sun, hove to. Conan and 
Rolf rowed towards the pirate craft. 

The gunwale was lined v/ith 
faces. Many were swathed in 
colorful head-cloths. Some 
favored the eastern turban; 
others bore helmets of steel 
or bronze. A few had pates 



CONAM THE VICTORIOUS 



shaven and bare except for a 
scalp-lock. Cold cruel eyes 
scrutinized the two strangers 
in the sloop. 

The small craft bumped 
against the side of the bigger 
vessel. A rope was lowered. 
Hand over hand, Conan a<id 
Rolf climbed with the agility of practiced seamen. Clearing the gunwale, they found 
themselves in the center of 
a half-circle of curious pirates, all shouting queries at 
once. Among them Conan recognized several who had followed him in former days. 
He snarled : 

"Dogs, don't you know 
me? Is your memory so short 
that you you must be reminded of my name, or have your 
eyes grown dim with age?" 

Several men in the throng 
had drawn back, blanching 
from the shock of recognition. One, white-faced, 
rasped : 

"A ghost, by Tarim! Erlik 
preserve us! It is our old admiral, come back from his 
grave to haunt us!" Veteran 
though he was, the grizzled 
pirate was obviously terrified as he pointed at Conan. 
"You perished many years 
ago, when the vampires of 
the Colchian Mountains assailed your crew as they fled 
from the Turanians after 
taking vengeance on Artaban 
of Shahpur. Begone, spirit, 
or we shall all be doomed!" 

Conan gave a gusty laugh. 
He plucked Rolf's dagger 
from its sheath and hurled it 



4? 

to the deck so that tire poliit 
v/as driven inches deep into 
the planking. Then he pulled 
the weapon out. 

"Have you taken lea/e of 
your senses, Artus?" he 
roared. "Could a ghost make 
that nick in the deck? Come, 
man, I am as alive as the hot 
of you and, if you believe me 
not, I'll crack a few heads to 
prove it! I escaped both the 
vampires and the Turanians, 
and what befell me after that 
is no concern of yours. Do 
you know me now?" 

Conan's old followers now 
joyfully milled about the 
towering Cimmerian to shake 
his hand and clap his back. 
Men who had never seen him 
before crowded with the others, fired with curiosity 
about a man whose name was 
legendary and whose fantastic exploits were still told by 
the wine-kegs on still evenings. 

Suddenly a sharp voice 
sheared through the clamor: 
"Avast, there! What's going 
on? Who are they? I told 
you to fetch them to me as 
soon as they were picked 
up !" 

A tall man, wearing a light 
mailshirt, stood on the bridge, 
one first banging the rails. A 
badly-healed scar from eye to 
chin disfigured his long narrow face. 

"It is Conan, Captain!" 
cried old Artus, the shipmaster. "Our old admiral has returned !" 

The captain's close-set eyet 



50 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



narrowed as his own sight 
sought confirmation of the 
oldster's words. He opened 
his mouth to speak, but Conan beat him to it. 

"Are you not glad to see 
me, Yanak? Remember how I 
kicked you out of the fleet 
for hoarding spoils that belonged to all? How have you 
managed to trick your way to 
a captaincy? Ill days must 
have dawned for the Brotherhood!" 

Yanak spat back : "For that, 
barbarian, I will have you 
hung by the heels and 
roasted over the ship's fire! 
I am captain and give the orders here!" 

"That may be," retorted 
Conan. "But I am still a 
member of the Brotherhood." 
He looked challengingly 
around, and nobody chose to 
deny his assertion. "I claim a 
right according to the articles. The right of any member of the Brotherhood to 
fight the captain of a ship 
for the captaincy in a captain's duel." 

He tossed up the dagger 
he had borrowed from Rolf 
and caught it again. It was a 
formidable weapon with a 
broad foot-long blade, but 
still no sword. 

The crew murmured, for 
all that in such a duel Conan 
would have to fight with 
whatever weapon he had with 
him at the time, while Yanak 
could choose what weapon he pleased. 

"This is madness, Conan!" 



Artus plucked the Cimmerian's elbow. "Yanak will cut 
you to pieces. We'll depose 
him instead and choose you 
for captain. All your old followers are on your side." 

Conan shook his head and 
rumbled: "Half the crew 
don't know rne and would oppose such a move. The men 
would be split into factions 
and our strength would be 
weakened. No, it must be 
done the traditional way." 

Several crewmen were already clearing a space around 
the mast. Yanak approached, 
a gleeful smile on his scarred 
face as his hands tented the 
supple strength of a keen 
straight sword. 

Conan gripped his dagger 
firmly and strode towards 
the mast. A large circle six 
yards in diameter was already drawn in charcoal on 
the deck around the mast The 
rules of the fight were simple. The antagonists were to 
fight inside the circle. Any 
trick was allowed. The fight 
would be to the doath, or until one of the duellists was so 
badly hurt he could not go 
on. In that case he would 
simply be flung overboard 
anyway. If one of the fighters stepped out of the circle, 
the onlookers would at once 
thrust him back in. 

The instant Conan entered 
the circle, Yanak bounded 
forward, cleaving the air 
with a whistling stroke. But 
the barbarian was too old a 
hand to be surprised. He 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



51 



leaped sideways, and Yanak 
was saved from a daggerthrust in his side only by 
twisting his body aside at the 
last moment. After that, he 
moved more warily, although 
he was clearly at an advantage. Now and then he made a 
sudden attack, shouting and 
cursing, but the silent Cimmerian parried or evaded the 
blows with effortless ease 
and continued to circle around 
the mast. 

Then Yanak tried a trick. 
Conan and he were temporarily on the same side of the 
mast. With all the power of 
his knotted leg-muscles, the 
captain sprang upwards in a 
mighty leap, at the same time 
smiting downward at the 
Cimmerian's bare head. 

But Conan's instinct triggered his lightning-fast responses. Instead of retreating, he sprang forward. Yanak's blade whistled harmlessly down behind the barbarian's back as Conan buried 
his knife to the hilt in his 
foe's abdomen, shearing 
through the light mail-links 
with the immense force of 
his thrust. The pirate fell to 
the deck, cursing and gagging on blood. Conan 
stooped and lifted him up. 
With a mighty heave, he 
flung the corpse over the 
heads of the crew into the 
6ea. Picking up the fallen 
sword, he swept their ranks 
with a cold gaze. 

"Now who is captain, my 
lads?" 



The shouts of '.'Conan!" 
would have satisfied any 
doubter. Conan drank in the 
heavy satisfaction of his newwon power. Then his thunderous voice bellowed them to 
silence. 

"To the sails and oars, lubbers! A man to the masthead 
as lookout! I have Yezdigerd 
himself hot on my trail!" 

Taken aback by the announcement that their archenemy was abroad, the crew's 
idolatrous confidence in Co-, 
nan was yet so strong as to 
wash away all misgivings. 
Many remembered how the 
Cimmerian had fought and 
tricked his way out of seemingly impossible odds. 

Conan sprang to the bridge 
in one mighty leap, shouting: 
"Set sail! Course southeast!" 

Men hauled at lines, voicing lusty sea-songs. Yellow 
canvas spread before the 
breeze. The pirate at the 
helm strained with knotted 
muscles at the steering-oar, 
bringing the slim vessel 
about. She fled eastward before the wind, fleet as the 
deer of the moorlands. 

"So you think I'm mad, Artus? By Crom, I hope Yezdigerd thinks so too !" 

Conan's hearty laughter resounded in the well-appointed cabin as he sprawled 
in a chair, a tumber of wine 
in his hand. Conan had casually possessed himself of 
the wardrobe of his predecessor and clad himself in the 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



colorful garb of a Vilayet pirate : scarlet breeches, flaring 
sea-boots, a yellow shirt of 
fine Vendhyan silk with 
wide sleeves, and a wide varicolored sash around his waist. 
The costume was topped off 
by a red cloth around his 
head. 

Together with Rolf, Artus 
the shipmaster lounged in 
Conan"s company while 
the galley swiftly cleaved 
with waters of the inland sea. 
With clouded brow, he set his 
goblet on the table. 

"No, Conan, I know you 
too well. But this seems a 
hare-brained scheme, dashing 
straight into the jaws of the 
Turanian. The men are drunk 
with confidence and do not 
think of the fact that Yeziperd will bring at least two 
large war- galleys. I am old 
and sober enough to stop and 
ponder. What are your intentions?" 

With sudden gravity, Conan rose and went to a gilded 
wooden cupboard. Opening it, 
he brought out a roll of 
parchment. This he spread 
upon the table. It was a chart 
of the waters they were now 
sailing. 

"Here is our position. Yezdigerd has been four days on 
his way from Aghrapur. The 
Turanian ships are running 
free. With their mean speed, 
I compute them to be somewhere in this area." (He 
pointed to a spot on the 
chart.) "With our present 
t&urse and speed, we shall 



rendezvous with Yezdigerd 
somewhere off the Zhurazi 
Archipelago." 

"The Zhurazi, eh?" muttered Artus. "Thoee are 
dangerous waters. The charts 
show no soundings. That 
cursed cluster is shunned by 
sane men. Some say it is 
haunted by demons and monsters from the darker rea'ms 
and that you are lost if you 
set foot on its shores." 

"Lost, hell!" rumb'ed Conan. "I once lived on the north 
main island for a fortnight 
after shipwreck. There was a 
tribe of yellow savages 
dwelling among the crags, 
and I had the devil of a time 
stopping them from sacrificing me to their lizard-god !" 

Thus lightly he dismissed 
the hair-raising drams played 
out on these islands years before. The pantherish Cimmerian had not only stayed alive 
in a land of hostile people, 
but also had slain the monster 
out of forgotten ages that terrorized the inhabitants. 

He stood for a while in silence, regarding the chart. 
Then, with a sudden gesture, 
he swept it off the table and 
swung about to face his 
friends. 

"Right you are, Artus. 
There are no soundings on 
this chart. Turanian, isn't it? 
Drawn by the king's own surveyors in A g h r S p u r — the 
very type of map our bloodthirsty pursuer will have. 
That is our advantage." 

And however they pressed 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



him, lie would not explain 
further. 

Muscles played on the 
sweating backs of the slaves 
at the oars. The blades rose 
and fell in steady rhythm, 
speeding the huge war-vessel 
over the waves. The burly 
slave-master strode the catwalk with his braided whip, 
his skin gleaming with sweat 
and oil. Now and then the 
whiplash uncurled like a 
striking cobra, to hiss out 
and mark the back of a faltering oarsman. 

The king took his ease on a 
silken couch on the poop, 
shaded by an awning and sipping wine from a golden 
beaker. On a similar bed by 
his side lounged the lady 
Thanara. 

The king was sunk in one 
of his spells of gloom. His 
gaze was brooding and somber, as he slowly swirled the 
pale-yellow liquid in the 
golden bowl. He said: 

"Evil powers aid the Cimmerian cbvil! He must have 
stolen a boat immediately 
upon his escape. My cursed 
admirals need half a day to 
put my flagship to sea, and 
then the devils that ruin human patience have turned the 
wind against us. We move 
like snai's." 

"Better than he can do, 
though," said Thanara, looking lazily at the monarch 
from under long eyelashes. 
"His puny oars will avail 
him little in this wind. Every 
stroke of the club on the 



53 

block lessens his head-start. 
Be patient, my lord! Erlik 
will deliver the barbarian 
into our hands." 

"My henchmen have often 
thought so, yet that scoundrel has tricked his way out 
of every trap. Now for once 
I am the hunter! By the 
beard of my father Yildiz, 
there will be a reckoning!" 
Yezdigerd's voice became 
eager and his eyes filled with 
new energy. He shaded his 
face and looked out over the 
glittering waters. 

He made a quick gesture. 
The admiral hurried forward, 
the gilded scales of his mail 
winking in the sunlight. 

"I see land, Uthghiz. Have 
we veered from our course?" 
said the king. 

The admiral, knowing his 
sovreign's irascible temper, 
quickly unfolded a map and 
pointed. 

"That, my lord, is the 
Z h u r a z i Archipelago. The 
Cimmerian has probably 
landed there for food and water. I intend to scan the coast 
for signs of his boat." 

"You may be right. But 
keep every man alert. How 
close can you sail?" 

"These are unknown waters, my lord. The conditions 
of life on the islands are 
shrouded in superstition. 
Horrible tales are told of 
fiendish monsters haunting 
the crags. We dare not go too 
close lest we strike unseen 
rocks." 

The king sank back on his 



54 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



gilded couch, muttering, but 
the yedka continued to scan 
the ragged coastline. Had her 
eyes deceived her? Was that 
a sail she glimpsed before it 
disappeared behind a rocky 
islet on the fringe of the 
cluster? The Turanian shins 
drew closer with every carstroke. 

She stiffened and pointed. 
The sail had reappeared. 

"Look, my lord!" she cried. 
"Yonder is a prize for your 
ships! A pirate! We have 
surprised them!" 

The yedka was not the 
only one who spied the corsair. Swift orders were 
shouted. The crew prepared 
for battle, while signals were 
run up to warn the sister vessel to do likewise. 

The overseers moved 
among the benches to check 
the fetters chaining the rowers. Stacks of arms were 
readied by the mast, and the 
ship's soldiery ran to their 
stations. Archers climbed 
into the rigging to suitable 
points of vantage, while 
groups of burly seamen; 
armed with grapnels, stood 
by at the gunwales. 

Though Conan's sharp eyes 
could discern the details of 
these preparations, he knew 
that they began as soon as he 
let his ship be sighted. The 
pirate ship was long since 
ready for battle. Despite the 
heavy odds against the pirate 
crew, all trusted their barbaric captain implicity. Men who 



had sailed with Conan years 
ago told fantastic tales about 
former sea-fights and the ingenious ways the Cimmerian 
had turned the tables on his 
foes. 

"Prep-re to go about!" The 
sharp voice of their captain 
cut like steel through the 
din. 

The order was a shock to 
the crew. Here they were, 
ready for the attack, with the 
greatest captain in the world 
to lead them — and what did 
this captain do? Prepare to 
run like a rabbit! Bewildered, 
they went half-heartedly to 
their chores. Conan noticed 
their listlessness and 
snarled : 

"Be swift, you mangy rascals, or I'll have your backs 
raw under the lash! Do you 
think I'm fool enough to 
fight two war-galleys, each 
with twice my strength, on 
the open sea, when I have a 
better plan? Do not worry, 
lubbers, we shall have a 
feasting of swords that songs 
will be written about. Now 
go to it!" 

Fired with new enthusiasm, 
the men sprang into the rigging. Soon the ship was 
speeding towards the inner 
parts of the Zhurazi Archipelago. 

The Zhurazi Archipelago 
is made of two large islands 
surrounded by a great number of smaller isles. The 
strait between the two main 
islands is a long narrow 
channel, and for this Conan 



CONAN THE VICTORIOUS 



55 



guided his ship. There was 
grim expectation in his mien 
as he viewed the Turanian 
galleys following- astern, 
their oars laboring with all 
the power that could be 
wrung from the slaves. 

King Yezdigerd paced the 
poop, armed in silvered Turanian mail and a gold-spired 
helmet. He bore a round emblazoned shield on his left 
arm; a long scimitar hung bv 
his side. The cruel and 
gloomy Turanian monarch 
was also a fierce and intrepid 
warrior who loved to take 
part in a good fight in person. 

"See how the yellow hyenas flee!" he cried. "Will they 
play games with us? They 
will lose the wind among the 
islands, and then our oars 
will make them eary prey. 
Faster!" 

Meanwhile the admiral 
conferred in low tones with 
the shipmaster, who argued 
his point with many gestures 
and headnhakings. The admiral, looking dotibtfitl, ws«t 
back up to the poop. He said: 

"Your majesty, these waters are unsounded. We have 
no charts we can trust, and 
the shipmaster fears we shall 
ground. I suggest we circle 
the island and catch the corsair in open sea." 

Yezdigerd's voice swept 
aside the misgivings of his 
admiral with a sweeping gesture. 

"I told you the rascal will 



be an easy prey in the lee of 
the islands. Let the whips be 
plied to bring us every ounce 
of speed. We shall snap our 
jaws about the pirate soon 
enough !" 

The king seemed to have 
reason for his expectations. 
The slender corsair was now 
barely halfway through the 
strait, making laborious 
headway. The Turanians, seeing their victim as good as 
caught, shouted with glee. 

Dismay reigned among the 
pirate crew. Their progress 
was slow, and the Hyrkanian 
ships were closing in with 
every stroke. Rolf stood silent, with the taciturnity of 
the northern barbarian,' but 
Artus pleaded with his captain to make some move to 
evade the impending doom. 

"Captain, the Hyrkanians 
will reach us long before we 
emerge! We cannot maneuver in this narrow way, and 
their rams will splinter us 
like an eggshell. Could we 
not warp her ashore with the 
boats? We might put up a 
fight in the jungle. Tarim! 
We must do something!" 

Conan, his calm unruffled, 
pointed at the oncoming wargalleys. In the lead came the 
Scimitar with white water 
boiling up around her bow 
and her ten-foot bronze ram. 
She seemed a very angel of 
doom, descending in swift 
anger upon the wrongdoer. 
Close behind followed her 
sister. 



56 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



"A pretty sight, by Ishtar," 
said Conan calmly. "Good 
speed, too. The slave-drivers 
must be plying their whips 
with vigor." 

His voice changed its tone 
from light banter to stern efficiency. "What are our soundings now?" 

"Five fathoms, captain, and 
slowly increasing. We have 
passed the throat of the shallows. A wonder we did not 
scrape our bottom off !" 

"Good! I knew we should 
get through. Now look at our 
pursuers !" 

The Scimitar, bearing 
down upon her prey at full 
speed, suddenly stopped dead. 
A cracking of timbers and 
snapping of cordage resounded between the islands. Cries 
of dimay rent the air as the 
mast snapped off at the base 
and toppled, shrouding the 
decks in folds of canvas. The 
oars beean backing to get her 
off, but her speed at the time 
of grounding had been too 
great. The unseen sandbank 
held her fast like a clutching 
octopus. 

The other galley was a little more fortunate. When the 
leading vessel struck, her captain promptly ordered the 
oars to back water. But the 
oars were unevenly applied 
in the confusion and the galley veered to port towards 
the shore. She was saved 
from the cliffs only by another sandbank, into which 
she plowed deeply. Boats 
were launched and lines paid 



out to prepare for the arduous task of warping her afloat. 

The throng on the desk of 
the corsair howled, shook 
their weapons, and made uncomplimentary gestures at 
the Turanians. They cheered 
Conan, and even the pessimistic shipmaster voiced his 
frank esteem. 

"Those galleys will be days 
in getting afloat," said Artus. 
"I doubt the bigger one will 
ever sail again; her bottom 
must be half stove in. 

"So, captain, whither do we 
sail? Khoraf, where the slavers put in with the fairest 
women of the South? Rhamdan, where the great caravan 
road ends?'* 

Conan's voice was tinged 
with scorn as he swept the 
throng with his ice-blue 
glance. "We have Turanian 
ships here, my friends. We 
have not escaped Yezdigerd; 
we have caught him in a 
trap ! I promised you a feasting of swords. You shall have 
it." He paused, looking upward. "The wind freshens; 
we are coming out of lee. Set 
a course to round the larboard island!" 

Eager hands sprag to the 
lines as all realized the full 
genius of Conan's planning. 

King Yezdigerd paced the 
poop of his shattered flagship in blazing anger. Some 
of it he vented upon the seaman at the sounding-post and 
the steersman, by having both 



CON AN THE 

beheaded forthwith. There 
was no immediate danger of 
sinking, for the hull had settled firmly upon the reef. 
But the hold had quickly 
filled with water from many 
sprung seams, indicating that 
the ship could probably never 
be saved. And the trick 
played upon the king by the 
escaping pirate infuriated his 
always irascible temper. 

"I will hunt that dog to the 
ends of the earth !" he shouted. "The whole thing smacks 
of that devil Conan. I'll warrant he is aboard. Will Khogar never get his cursed tub 
afloat?" 

Thus he raged while work 
progressed on the Khoralian 
Star. As the Ion 5 day wore 
on, the c-2ws slowly coaxed 
the ship off the ssndhank by 
inches, by tUfr/rinT gpd h a ?.ving with the ships" bolts. The 
captain of the Star v.-as deeply preoccupied with directing 
this work when his attention 
was drawn bv the warning 
cry of the lookout. 

Rounding the point, her 
yellow sail billowing majestically, came the shin thev h?6 
expected to be in full flight. 
Her bulwarks and shrewds 
were hned with ea^er corsairs. Faintly, their mocking 
challenges reached the Turanians' ears, like the cries of 
faraway demons in Hell. 

Straight for the helpless 
KhorgUan Stp.r she bore like 
a striking ea<;le. She rammed 
a ship's boat, cuni'ijr it in two 
and sending splinters and 



VICTORIOUS 57 

bodies flying. Then she shortened her sail, made a quick 
turn, and in an instant lay 
board and board with her 
prey. Grappling hooks bit into 
Turanian wood, and a rain of 
arrows preceded the yelling, 
murderous host that surged 
over the gunwales. 

The corsairs swept the lower deck, littering the plank? 
with corpses. But they were 
checked by a blast of arrows 
from the poop, where the Turanian soldiery were drawn up 
behind a bristling hedp-e of 
spears. Only a moment they 
checked their attack. Their 
ti:ey swept on irresistibly. 

The Turanians could not 
stand against there hardened 
fighters, led by the ferocious 
Cimmerian. A. vicious swiri 
of Cc; nan's b r o a 6 s w o r d 
opened a breach in the ft. carhedge. 

Tlie captain, knowing that 
his only chance of saving his 
ship lay in slaying the pirate 
leader, sprang to meet Conan. 
Their blades clashed in a circular dance of steel. But the 
Turanian could not mas f er the 
sworc-craft of Conan. veteran 
from a Ihournnd bs' HeficTds. 
The sham ef'ge of the Turanian's ys>»aphan sbsved a 
raven lock from the Cimmerian's ducking head ; then the 
heavy broadsword smashed 
into the can tern's mailed side. 
Khogar sank down dying, his 
rib-cage ca v ed in. 

The fight went c,?t of the 
Turanian soldienr as their 
captain fell. Cries for quarter 



58 



FANTASTIC 



were heard. The men flung 
down their arms in heaps. 

Conan surveyed the scene 
with grim satisfaction. He 
had lost a score of men, but 
he had captured the only navigable ship at his enemy's 
disposal. Several of the pirate 
crew were already at work 
striking the fetters from the 
slaves' ankles. They shouted 
for joy as they found longlost friends among them. 
Others herded the captive 
Turanians into custody below. 

While a prize crew continued the labor of freeing the 
vessel, the pirate ship cast 
off. Her decks were jammed, 
for her own crew was augmented by scores of freed and 
hastily-armed galley-slaves. 
She headed straight for bigger prize. 

In a tavern in Onagrul, a 
secret stronghold of the Vilayet pirates, loud voices 
called for more wine. The 
cool clear liquid poured into 
old Artos' cup as the ears of 
the throng itched for more of 
his tales. The grizzled shipmaster washed down the 
draught in thirsty gulps. 
Satisfied, he wiped his lips 
upon the back of his hand and 
took in the crowd of listeners 
with a glance. 

"Aye, lads, you should have 
been there! Great and glorious was the fighting as we 
took, the first one. Then we 
swept down upon Yezdigerd's 
Scimitar. We must have 
eeemed like very devils out 



UNIVERSE 

of Hell, but they were ready. 
They severed the lines of our 
grapnels with swords and 
axes, until our archers blasted them back from the rail 
and we warped in to their 
side by mighty efforts. We 
laid her board and board, and 
every man among us was fired 
with killing-lust. 

"Conan was the first aboard 
her. The Turanians closed in 
about him in a circle of 
swords, but he slashed at 
them so savagely that they 
gave way. Then we all came 
in a rush. The Turanians 
were all well-trained and 
hardened fighters, Yezdigerd's household troops, fighting under the eye of their 
king. For a moment the outcome was precarious, in spite 
of the ferocity of Conan, who 
smashed Turanian mail and 
arms like rotten wood. They 
stood in perfect unity, and our 
attacks recoiled from their 
massed ranks like bloody 
waves. 

"Then came a cry of triumph, for some of us had 
jumped dov/n among the galley-slaves, slain the overseers, 
and struck the chains from 
the rowers' ankles. The slaves 
surged up on the deck like 
a horde of lost souls. They 
snatched whatever weapons 
they could find from the corpses. Heedless of their own 
lines, they drove into the Turanians, shouldering us aside. 

"The glittering ranks waverecl Conan yelled a weird 
Iv's.'r :.-r *rd thing himself 



COHAN THE VICTORIOUS

into the press. We followed, 
determined to win or die. 

"Conan was terrible as a 
tiger. He plunged in where 
the fighting was the thickest, 
and always his advent spelled 
doom for the Hyr Iranians. 
With all his savage passion, 
he moved towards the poop 
where Yezdigerd himself 
stood bellowing orders, surrounded by his picked men. 

"Conan smote their ranks 
like a charging elephant. 
Then a cry of rage came from 
Yezdigerd, and the king 
himself rushed to meet him. 
Savage curses streamed from 
his lips as they engaged. 

" 'I recognized your hand in 
this, Cimmerian cur!' he 
screamed. 'By Erlik, now you 
shall reap your deserts! Die, 
barbarian dog!' 

"He aimed a terrific stroke 
at Conan's head. No ordinary 
man could have avoided or 
stopped that swift and powerful blow, but Conan parried 
it in a flashing movement too 
quick for the eye to follow. 

" 'Die yourself, jackal of 
Turan!' he thundered. For an 
instant they struck and parried like lightening, while the 
rest of us stopped fighting to 
watch. Then a mighty blow 
shattered Yezidgerd's shield 
and made him drop his shieldarm. In one lightening sweep, 
Conan smote the bearded 
head from the king's giant 
body. 

"After that, the Turanians 
surrendered meekly enough. 



W e did not get many prisoners, for the swords had taken 
too heavy a toll. A bare half 
of our original two hundred 
were left standing, but we 
had captured or slain five 
hundred of the Hyrkanian 
dogs." 

He gulped down more wine 
and held out his cup for a refill. During the pause, a hearer asked: "What about the 
Turanian yedka? What became of her?" 

Artus' brows clouded and 
he gave a visible shudder. 
"That was the strangest event 
of that memorable day. We 
were binding up wounds and 
herding prisoners when the 
sun seemed to cloud over and 
a chill of doom fell upon us. 
The water swirled blackly 
about our ships. Wind 
moaned in the rigging like 
the lament of a lost soul, 
though we were under the lee 
of a cliff. 

"Someone cried and pointed 
up. In the sky appeared a 
black dot, growing swiftly 
larger. At first it looked like 
a bird or bat. Then it grew to 
a fantastic, horrible shape, 
manlike but winged. With a 
rush of vast leathery wings 
it swooped to the poop deck, 
uttering a shrill cry that 
smote our hearts like death. 

"At that cry, the woman of 
Maypur stepped from the 
oop cabin, which none of us 
ad yet entered. In the wink 
of an eye, the monster 
snatched her up and bore he* 
off, flapping heavily over iha 



i

oily waters of the channel. In 
a few seconds both were oiu 
of sight, and the su.i shone 
once again. 

"Wc stared at one another, 
whiie-faeed. Had the fiend 
stayed, I am sure we should 
have all leaped into the sea to 
escaoe it, though it was gone 
so" quickly that we had no 
tiny; for panic. Even Conan 
looked shaken and pa!e. 

" 'I have seen that thing before,' he muttered, but he 
would not explain. Some of 
us surmised that the devil had 
come to drag Thanara off to 
the hell of Erlik's worshipers. 
But others, who had been 
standing close to her when 
the creature swooped upon 
us, said that she showed no 
fear of it, but rather eagerness, as if she had summoned 
it herself. 

"At last Conan shook himself like one coming out of a 
da?:e and bellowed orders to 
strip the slain of valuables 
and pitch the corpses over the 
side, even the body of the 
king. All he would say of the 
abduction of Thanara was: 

" 'Let the damned husny escape with her bogey-man. I 
do not war upon women, 
though I would have striped 
her hide for her treachery.' 

"And that was the end of 
the matter. We burned the 
grounded galley and sailed 
the other one hither." 

"And where is Conan?" 
cried another listener. "Why 
is he' not here to tell us tales 
of his adventures himself? 



UNIVERSE 

Will he return as our leader 
to sweep the Turanians from 
the sea?' 

"Alas, no! The Cimmerian 
ordered the ships to make 
straight for the eastern shore. 
He said he was on a vital mission. One of the slaves we 
freed was a Khitan. Conan remained with him for hour:-., 
squatting in conversation. 
They talked of far lands beyond the Himelias. If Khitai 
be his goal, he must seek some 
really fabulous treasure." 

"Why took he not a score 
of sea-rovers with him?" 

"That is another mystery. 
He swore he had taken an oath 
to journey alone, and that his 
goal would be unattainable 
otherwise. 

"We landed him on the 
eastern shore, and the farewell between him and Rolf 
the Northerner was short and 
manly. The crew in their sorrow began chanting a seadirge, until he lifted his 
mighty voice to curse us to 
silence. We watched him disappear behind a sand-clune on 
his way to unknown perils. 

"Rolf is our captain now, 
and an abler one is not to be 
found barring Conan. For Conan will always remain the 
greatest captain of them all, 
even when Vilayet Sea has 
become a desert waste and 
the stars have fallen from the 
heavens. I drink his health. 
May his quest be successful!" 

The toast was drunk in a 
silence oddly out of place in 
a pirates' tavern.

They had coir.e to pa«s judgement on him. He had violated 
their law — wilfully, ignorantly, and very deliberately. 



"OUR people will be arriving to visit us today," the robot said. 

"Shut up!" snapped Rod 
Rankin. He jumped, wiry and 
quick, out of the chair on his 
verandah and stared eta cloud 
or dust in the distance. 

"Our people—" the len-foot, 
cylinder-bodied robot grated, 
when Rod Rankin interrupted 
him. 

"I don't care about your 
fool people," said Rankin. He 
squinted at the cloud of dust 
getting bigger and clorer beyond the wall of kesh trees 
that surrounded the rolling 
acres of his plantation. "That 
damned new neighbor of rnine 
is coming over here again." 

He gestured widely, taking 
in the dozens of robots with 
their shiny, cylindrical bodies 
and pipestem arms and legs 
laboring in his fields. "Get all 
your people together and go 
hide in the wood, fast." 

"It is not right," said the 
robot. "W e were made to serve

"Well there are only a bundled of you, and I'm not sharing you with anybody," said 
Rankin. 

"It is not right," the robot 
repeated.

"Don't talk to me about 
what's right," said Rankin. 
"You're built to follow orders, 
nothing else. I lthow a thing 
or two about how you robots 
work. You've got one law, to 
follow orders, and until that 
neighbor of mine sees you to 
give you orders, you work for 
me. Now get into those woods 
and hide till he goes away." 

"We will go to greet those 
who visit us today," said the 
Robot. 

"Alright, alright, scram," 
said Rankin. 

The robots in the fields and 
the one whom Rankin had 
been talking to formed a column and marched off into the 
trackless forests behind his 
plantation. 

A battered old ground-car 
drove up a few minutes later. 
A tall, broad-shouldered man 
with a deep tan got ov.t and 
walked up the path to Rankin's verandah. 

"Hi, Barrows," said Rankin. 
"Hello," said Barrows. "See 
your crop's coming along pretty well. Can't figure how you 
do it. You've got acres and 
acres to tend, far's I can see, 
and I'm having a hell of a 
time with one little piece of 
ground. I swear you must 
know something about this 
planet that I don't know." 

"Just scientific farming," 
said Rankin carelessly. "Look, 
you come over here for something, or just to gab? I got 
a lot of work to do." 

Barrows looked weary and 
worried. "Them brown beetles 



is at my crop again," he said. 
"Thought you might know 
some way of getting rid of 
them." 

"Sure," said Rankin. "Pick 
them off, one by one. That's 
how I get rid of them." 

"Why, man," said Barrows, 
"you can't walk all over these 
miles and miles of farm and 
pick off every one of them 
beetles. You must know another way." 

Rankin drew himself up and 
stared at Barrows. "I'm telling you all I feel like telling 
you. You going to stand here 
and jaw all day? Seems to me 
like you got work to do." 

"Rankin," said Barrows, "I 
know you were a crook back 
in the Terran Empire, and 
that you came out beyond the 
border to escape the law. 
Seems to me, though, that 
even a crook, any man, would 
be willing to help his only 
neighbor out on a lone planet 
like this. You might need help 
yourself, sometime." 

"You keep your thoughts 
about my past to yourself," 
said Rankin. "Remember, I 
keep a gun. And you've got a 
wife and a whole bunch of 
kids on that farm of yours. 
Be smart and let me alone." 

"I'm going," said Barrows. 
He walked off the verandah 
and turned and spat carefully 
into the dusty path. He 
climbed into his ground car 
and drove off. 

Rankin, angry, watched him 
go. Then he heard a humming 
noise from another direction. 
He turned. A huge, white 



THE HELPFUL ROBOTS

globe was descending across 
the sky. A space ship, thought 
Rank.in, startled. 

Police? This planet was 
outside the jurisdiction of the 
Terran Empire. When he'd 
cracked that safe and made off 
with a hundred thousand credits, he'd headed here, because 
the planet was part of something called the Clearchan 
Confederacy. No extradition 
treaties or anything. Perfectly safe, if the planet was safe. 

And the planet was more 
than safe. There bad been a 
hundred robots waiting when 
he landed. Where they came 
from he didn't know, but Rankin prided himself on knowing how to handle robots. He'd 
appropriated their services 
and started his farm. At the 
rate he was going, he'd be a 
plantation owner before long. 

That must be where the ship 
was from. The robot said 
they'd expected visitors. Must 
be the Clearchan Confederacy 
visiting this robot outpost. 
Was that good or bad? 

From everything he'd read, 
and from what the robots had 
told him, they were probably 
more robots. That was good, 
because he knew how to handle robots. 

The white globe disappeared into the jungle of kesji 
trees. Rankin waited. 

A half hour later the column of his robot laborers 
marched out of the forest. 
There were three more robots, 
painted grey, at the head. The 
new ones from the ship, 



thought Rankin. Well,, he'd 
better establish who was boss 
right from the start. 

"Stop right there !" he 
shouted. 

The shiny robot laborers 
halted. But the three grey 
ones came on. 

"Stop!'' shouted Rankin. 

They didn't stop, and by the 
time they reached the verandah, he cursed himself for 
having failed to get his gun. 

Two of the huge grey robots laid gentle hands on his 
arms. Gentle hands, but hands 
of superstrong metal. 

The third said, "We have 
come to pass judgement on 
you. You have violated our 
law." 

"What do you mean?" said 
Rankin. "The only law robots 
have is to obey orders." 

"It is true that the robots 
of your Terran Empire and 
these simple workers here 
must obey orders. But they 
are subject to a higher law, 
and you have forced them to 
break it. That is your crime." 

"What crime?" said Rankin. 

"We of the Clearchan Confederacy are a race of robots. 
Our makers implanted one 
law in us, and then passed on. 
We have carried our law Sto 
all the planets we have colonized. In obeying your orders, 
these workers were simply 
following that one law. You 
must be taken to our capital, 
and there be imprisoned and 
treated for your crime.'' 

"What law? What crime?" 

"Our law," said the giant 
j»bot, "is, Help *hy neighbor"

Longtree played. His features 
relaxed into a gentle smile 
of happiness and his body 
turned a bright red orange. 



LONGTREE sat before his 
hole in the ground and gazed 
thoughtfully among the 
sandy red hills that surrounded him. His skin at that 
moment was a v medium yellow, a shade between pride 
and happiness at having his 
brief symphony almost completed, with just a faint tinge 
of red to denote that uncertain, cautious approach to the 
last note which had eluded 
him thus far. 

He sat there unmoving for 
a while, and then he picked 
up his blowstring and fitted 
the mouthpiece between his 
thin lips. He blew into it 
softly and at the same time 
gently strummed the three 
strings stretching the length 
of the instrument. The note 
was a firm clear one which 
would have made any other 
musician proud. 

But Longtree frowned, and 
at the disappointment his 
body flushed a dark green 
and began taking on a purple 
cast of anger. Hastily, he put 
down the blowstring and 
tried to think of something 
else. Slowly his normal color 
returned.

There have been a number of interesting theories advanced about life on 
Mars, but few have equalled Charles Fritch'n intriguing picture of the 
world of Longtree and Channeljumper in its infinite variations, tonal 
and thematic. The Mars of these two is an old culture, old and finite.

came his friend Channeljumper, striding on the long 
thin ungainly legs that had 
given him his name. Kis skin 
radiated a blissful orange. 

"Longtree ! " Channeljumper exe'aimed enthusiastically, collapsing on the 
ground nearby a::d folding 
his legs around him. "How's 
the symphony coming?" 

"Not ro good," Longtree 
admitted sacly, and his skin 
turned green at the memory. 
"If I dent get that last note, 
I may be this color the rest 
of my lift." 

"Why don't you play what 
you've written so far. It's not 
very lon,i. and it might cheer 
ycu un a bit." 

You're a good friend, Channeliumper, Longtree thought, 
and when Eedsand and I arc 
married after the Music Festival we'll have you over to 
our hole for dinner. As he 
thought this, he felt his body 
take on an orange cast, and 
he felt better. 

"I can't seem to get that 
last note," h.2 said, picking up 
the b'owstring again and outting it into p'«ition. "The 
filial note must be conclusive, 
something complete in itself 
and yet be able to sum up the 
entire meaning of the S3'mphony preceding it." 

Channeljumper hummed 
sympathetically. "That's a big 
job for one note. It might be 
a sound no one has ever heard 
before." 

Longtree shrugged. "It rr.sy 



even sound alien," he admitted, "but it's got to be the 
right note." 

"Play, and we'll see," Channeljumper urged. 

Longtree played. And as he 
played, his features relaxed 
into a gentle smile of happiness and his body turned orange. Delicately, he strummed 
the three strings of the blowstring with his long-nailed 
fingers, softly he pursed his 
frail lips and Vew expertly 
into the mouthpiece. 

From the instrument came 
sounds the like of which 
Channeljumper had never before heard. The Martian sat 
and listened in evident rapture, his body radiating a 
golden glow of ecstacy. He 
sat and dreamed, and as the 
music played, his spine tingled with growing excitement. The music swelled, surrounding him, permeating 
him, picking him up in a 
great hand and sweeping 
him into new and strange and 
beautiful worlds — worlds of 
tell metal structures, of vast 
stretches of greenness and of 
water and of trees and of 
small pale creatures that flew 
gi?.nt metal insects He 
dreamed of the^e things which 
his planet Mars had not 
known for millions of years. 

After awhile, the music 
stopped, but for a moment 
neither of them said anything. 

At last Channeljumper 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



sighed. "It's beautiful," he 
said. 

"Yes," Longtree admitted. 

"But—" Channeljumper seemed puzzled — "but 
somehow it doesn't seem complete. Almost, but not quite. 
As though — as though — " 

Longtree sighed. "One 
more note would do it. One 
more note — no more, no less 
— at the end of the crescendo 
could tie the symphony together and end it. But which 
one? I've tried them all, and 
none of them fit I" 

His voice had risen higher 
in his excitement, and Channeljumper warned, "Careful, 
you're beginning to turn purple." 

"I know," Longtree said 
mournfully, and the purple 
tint changed to a more acceptable green. "But I've got 
to win first prize at the festival tomorrow; Redsand promised to marry me if I did." 

"You can't loss," Channeljumper told him, and then remembered, "if you can get 
that last note." 

"If," Longtree echoed despairingly, as though his 
friend had asked the impossible. "I wish I had your confidence, Chan; you're orange 
most of the time, while I'm a 
spectrum." 

"I haven't your artistic temperament," Channeljumper 
told him. "Besides, orange is 
such a homely color I feel 
ashamed to have it all the 
time." 

As he said this, he turned 



green with shame, and Longtree laughed at the paradox. 

Channeljumper laughed 
too, glad that he had diverted 
his friend3 attention from the 
elusive and perhaps non-existent note. "Did you know 
the space rocket is due pretty soon," he said, "perhaps 
even in time for the Music 
Festival." 

"Space rocket?" 

"Oh, I forgot you were 
busy composing and didn't 
get to hear about it," Channeljumper said. "Well, Bigwind who has a telescope in 
his hole told me a rocket is 
coming through space toward us, possibly from the 
third planet." 

"Oh?" Longtree said, not 
particularly interested. 

"I wonder if they'll look 
like us?" Channeljumoer 
wondered. 

"If they're intelligent, of 
course they will," Longtree 
said certainly, not caring. 
"Their culture will probably 
be alien, though, and their 
music — " He paused and 
turned a very deep yellow. 
"Of course! They might even 
be ab'e to furnish the note I 
need to complete my symphony!" 

Channeljumper shook his 
head. "You've got to compose it all yourself," he reminded, "or you don't qualify. And if you don't qualify, 
you^ can't win, and if you 
don't win, you can't marry 
Redsand."

"But just one little note—" 
Longtree said. 

Channeljumper shrugged 
helplessly and turned sympathetically green. "I don't 
make the rules," he said. 

"No. Well," Longtree went 
on in sudden determination, 
"I'll find that last note if I 
have to stay permanently 
purple." 

Channeljumper shuddered 
jestingly at this but remained 
pleasantly orange. "And I'll 
leave you alone so you can 
get to work," he said, unfolding himself. 

"Goodbye," Longtree said, 
but Channeljumper's long 
legs had already taken him 
over to the nearest sand dune 
and out of sight. 

Alone, Longtree picked up 
the blowstring once more, 
placed it against his stomach, 
and gave out with a clear, 
beautiful, experimental note 
which was again not the one 
he desired. 

He still had not found it an 
hour later, when the Sound 
came. The Sound was a low 
unpleasant rumble, a sound 
lower than any Longtree had 
ever heard, and he wondered 
what it was. Thinking of it, 
he remembered he had seen a 
large flash of fire in the sky 
a moment before the roar 
came. But since this last was 
clearly not likely at all, he 
dismissed the whole thing as 
imagination and tried again to 
coax some new note from the 
blowstring. 



A half hour later, Channeljumper came bounding excitedly over a sand dune. 
"They're here," he cried, 
screeching to a halt and emitting yellow flashes of color. 

"Who's here?" Longtree 
demanded, turning violet in 
annoyance at the interruption. 

"The visitors from 
space," Channeljumper explained. "They landed near 
my hole. They're little creatures, only half as big as we 
are, but thicker and grey 
colored." 

"Gray colored?" Longtree 
repeated incredulously, trying to picture the improbability. 

"But only on the outside," 
Channeljumper went on. 
"They have an outside shell 
that comes off, and inside 
they're sort of pink-orange." 

"Ah-ha," Longtree said, as 
though he'd suspected it all 
the time. "Evidently they 
wear grey suits of some kind, 
probably for protection." 

"They took them off anyway," Channeljumper said, 
eager to impart his knowledge, "and they were sort of 
pink-orange underneath. 
There are only two of them, 
and one has long hair." 

"Strange," Longtree mused, 
thinking of their own hairless 
bodies. "Wonder what they 
want." 

Channeljumper shrugged to 
indicate he didn't know. "The 
short-haired one followed 
me," 3ie said. 



63 FANTASTIC 

Longtree felt the chill blue 
of fear creep along his spine, 
but immediate anger at himself changed it conveniently 
to purple, and he was certain 
Channeljumper hadn't noticed. When he had controlled 
himself, he said, "Well, it 
doesn't matter I've got to get 
on with my symphony. That 
last note—" 

"He's here," Channeljumper announced. 

"What?" 

Channeljumper pointed 
eagerly, and Longtree's eyes 
followed the direction to 
where the alien stood at the 
top of a nearby dune staring 
at them. Longtree could feel 
his skin automatically turning red with caution, blending with the sand while the 
ever-trusting Channeljumper 
remained bright orange. 

"Good gosh," the alien exclaimed. "Not only do they 
look like modified grasshoppers, they change color 
too !" 

"What'd he say?" Longtree demanded. 

"How should I know?" 
Channeljumper said. "It's in 
another language." 

"And its voice," Longtree 
exclaimed, almost disbelieving it. "Low. Lower than 
even our drums' rumble." 

"And they talk in squeaks 
yet!" the alien told himself 
aloud. 

Longtree regarded the alien 
carefully. As Channeljumper 
had said, the creature was 
short and had close-cropped 



UNIVERSE 

hair on its head. The legs 
v/ere brief and pudgy, and 
Longtree felt a shade of pity 
for the creature who could 
obviously not get around as 
well as they. It was undoubtedly intelligent — the space 
rocket testified to that — and 
the fact that the creature's 
skin color stayed a peaceful 
pink-orange helped assure 
Longtree the alien's mission 
was friendly. 

The alien raised a short 
arm and stepped slowly forward. "I come in peace," he 
said in the language they 
could not understand. "My 
wife and I are probably the 
only humans left alive. When 
we left Earth, most of the 
population had been wiped out 
by atomics. I think we were 
the only ones to get away." 

Longtree felt his redness 
subside to orange, as he wondered idly what the alien had 
said. Except for a natural 
curiousity, he didn't really 
care, for he remembered suddenly the symphony he had 
to finish by tomorrow if he 
were to marry Redsand. But 
there was the element of politeness to consider, so he 
nudged Channeljumper, 

"Don't just stand there, 
say something !" 

Channeljumper flustered 
and turned several colors in 
rapid succession. He stammered, "Er — ah — welcome to 
our planet, o visitor from 
spa:.?." .- - 1 motioned the alien 
to sit -•• 1.

"That's not very creative," 
Longtree accused. 

"What's the difference," 
Channeljumper pointed out, 
"when he doesn't understand 
us anyway." 

"You guys don't really look 
like grasshoppers," the man 
from Earth apologised, coming forward; "it's Just the 
long legs that fooled me from 
up there. Boy, am I glad to 
find somebody intelligent on 
Mars; from the air we 
couldn't see any cities or anything, and we were afraid the 
planet didn't have any life. T 
wish we could understand 
each other, though." 

Longtree smiled pleasantly 
and wished the creature 
would go away so he could 
search for the last note to his 
symphony. Ke picked up his 
blow string so the alien 
wouldn't sit on it.

Longtree wondered, that the

incredible beauty of his composition might not translate 
acceptably to alien ears? He 
dismissed the thought as unlikely. 

"Er— that's a bit high, isn't 
it?" the creature said, shaking 
his head. 

Lost in the sweeping melodies, neither Longtree nor 
Channeljumper paid any attention to the meaningless 
syllables. Longtree played on, 
oblivious to all else, soaring 
toward the great screaming 
crescendo that would culminate with the missing note. 

Vaguely, he became aware 
that the creature had gotten 
up, and he turned a smaM part 
of his attention to the action. 
Longtree smiled inwardly, 
pleased, and turned yellow 
with pride to think even a 
man from another planet 
should so appreciate his symphony that he got up and 
danced a strange dance and 
even sang to the music. 

The alien held onto his 
ears and leaped erratically, 
singing, "rlo. no, ston it. 
It's t^o high. My head's bursting !" 

Channeljn.—ner too seemed 
pleased by 'his show of appreciation, though neither of

and Longtree swept into the 
final notes of the rising crescendo with a ?usto he had 
not previously displayed. Ke 
stopped where he had always 
stopped — and the final note 
ca*ne! 

It startled the Martians.

FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



Then the realization swept 
over them in glad tides of 
color. The symphony was 
complete now, with that final 
alien sound. Longtree could 
win both the festival prize 
and Redsand with it. The 
last note was a soft popping 
sound that had come from the 
creature from another planet. 
They looked to see him sagging to the ground, his head 
soft and pulpy. 

"My symphony's complete," Longtree exclaimed 
jubilantly, a brilliant yellow 
now. 

But Channeljumper's yellow happiness was tinged 
with green. "A pity," he said, 
"the creature had to give its 
life in exchange for the note." 

"I believe it really wanted 
to," Longtree said, turning 
solemn. "Did you see how it 
danced to the music, as 
though in the throes of ecstacy, and it didn't change color 
once ! It must have died happy to know it gave itself to a 
good cause." 

"You could probably get by 
with claiming to use the 
creature as an auxiliary instrument," mused Channeljumper, practical once more, 



"and eliminate any claim that 
he might have assisted you. 
But what about the Festival? 
This one looks as though he 
doesn't have another note in 
him." 

"There's the other one," 
Longtree reminded, "the one 
with long hair. We can save 
that one until tomorrow." 

"Of course," Channeljumper agreed, standing up. "I'll 
go get it, and you can keep it 
safe here in your hole until 
tomorrow night." 

"You're a good friend, 
Channel] umper," Longtree 
began, but the oth^r was already bounding out of sight 
over a sand dune. 

Blissfully he raised the 
blowstring into position and 
played the opening notes to 
his symphony. The alien lay 
unmoving with its head in a 
sticky puddle, but Longtree 
took no notice. He didn't even 
consider that after the Festival he would never be able to 
play his symphony again in 
all its glorious completeness. 
His spinal column tingled 
pleasantly, and his skin 
turned the golden yellow of 
unbearable happiness. 

The music was beautiful.

Angel Hair, Gossamer 
Showers and Flying Jellyfish 
— and what these have to do 
with UFO sightings today. 



ONE WEEKEND early 
this spring we were over in 
western New Jersey nosing 
out an unusual UFO observation. Ivan. Sanderson had 
heard from Chester Ehrie, of 
Belvidere, of an incident of a 
few years back that was said 
to involve that rare and mysterious stuff we call "angel 
hair." With the helpful assistance of Mr. Ehrie, we 
ended up in a hilltop home 
outside Easton, Pennsylvania, listening to pretty Mrs. 
Anna Eliason describe what 
she had seen on the morning 
of November 10, 1949. (This 
date gives the case the distinct'io n — u n t i 1 someone 
comes up with an earlier one 
— of being the first typical 
"angel hair" report on record.) 

The Eliasons were living 
then in a little house in Depue's Ferry, Pennsylvania, 
overlooking the Delaware 
River and directly opposite 
Foul Rift, New Jersey. It 
was a brilliant autumn day, 
with a cloudless blue sky, 
and not a breath of wind. One 
of two electricians' men installing the antenna for the 
Eliasons' new TV set came 



The Research Section of Civilian Saucer Intelligence continues to discuss 
angel hair and related phenomena in their fourth bi-monthly column on 
UFO sightings and reports, written specially for this magazine. CSI 
publishes a newsletter, has an extensive file of material on the subject.

into the kitchen to tell Mrs. 
Eiiason that there were some 
things in the sky that "must 
te what they call flying 
saucers." She went out and 
saw them too. High up in the 
southwestern sky, over the 
ridge that runs along the river, an indefinite number of 
bright, round objects were 
passing, "I could only compare the rn to electric light 
bulbs," she told us. They appeared to be not much smaller than the full moon in angular measurement. She could 
not be certain whether their 
brightness was due to luminosity, or was merely the reflection of the sun, which 
daczled the eye and interfered somewhat with observation. 

Apparently they were not 
disc-shaped, but spherical, as 
they did not flutter, and presented the same circular 
shape at all times. They were 
visible only briefly as they 
moved rapidly and horizontally along; whether all were 
moving in the same direction, 
or there was a coming or going, the witness cannot now 
, recall, but at any rate she did 
not observe the acrobatic behavior noted on such occasions. The display was gradually receding from her toward the southwest, and b»& 
evidently passed overhead a 
few minutes earlier. While 
they watched, something like 
cobwebs began to fall from 
the sky. Descending vertically in long strands and skeir-, 



UNIVERSE 

it festooned bushes and leafless trees with gleaming 
sheets of gossamer. In a surprisingly short time, according to Mrs. Eliason, "very 
heavy drapes of cobwebs" 
were spread over everything 
in sight. A dead tree near the 
house was "just covered with 
it." Though somewhat astonished by all this, Mrs. Eliason 
returned to the house to look 
after her children and prepare 
lunch. The "angel hair" was 
still falling when she went 
in, and she never did learn 
how long the shower lasted. 

Unlike real spiderweb, 
these silky fibres melted 
away like snow in sunshine. 
About 1 p.m., Mrs. Eliason's 
sister Helen drove up to visit her; enough was still in 
evidence at that time to 
cause her to remark on "those 
cobwebs all over the place." 
But by 5:30, when William 
Eliason (a plumbing contractor and former Air Force 
captain) returned home, there 
was no trace of them left. He 
was struck by his wife's 
story, and thought she might 
at least have touched some 
of the strange stuff. However, she had not done so, 
and whether it would have 
become gelatinous arsd evaporated when handled, or fis

It rvrrsnt that a very

SHAPES IN 

unknown substance must 
have fallen from the spherical objects as they passed 
slowly from Warren County, 
New Jersey west-southwestward toward Nazareth, Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, the 
only other observations we 
have heard of are by Mr. Eliason's father in Bridgeville, 
N.J. (six miles northeast of 
Depue's Ferry), who noticed 
the sky objects but not the 
"angel hair", and by Mrs. 
E 1 i a s o n ' s cousin Irene 
Thomas, in Hazen (four miles 
east-northeast of Depue's 
Ferry), whose "cleaning lady" 
remarked to her daughter, 
"Janet, I really ought to get 
up and clean off your television antenna — it's just covered with cobwebs!" And this 
is the sum total of our information on what took place in 
sight of many thousands of 
people, just sixty miles west 
of New York City, less than 
eight years ago. 

For the sake of comparison, here 2re two briefly-reported incidents that occurred 
five and seven years later: 

Late afternoon of October 
28, 1954: Three objects like 
"luminous silver coins" 
passed rapidly and silently 
over Rome in V formation; 
apparent size comparable to 
the moon; seen by U.S. Ambassador to Italy Clare Booth 
Luce, who said : "I saw something, but I don't know what 
it was." A few minutes after 
their passage, "cab drivers declared they saw fine cotton 
or wool particles falling 



THE SKY 73 

from the sky and hanging on 
telephone wires." (AP in 
N.Y. Journal-American, Oct. 
29, 1954.) 

Sept. 30, 1956, Cherry Valley, Illinois: Mr. and Mrs. 
L. L. Leonard noticed numerous round, white objects 
nearly overhead and travelling very fast; through 7X 
binoculars, they appeared 
half the size of a pea at arm's 
length. "The objects suddenly ejected long white streamers, which floated in the air, 
hanging absolutely perpendicular. These silver streamers 
must have been of an enormous length. In one part of 
the southwestern sky there 
was a concentration of them 
which looked like stationary 
silver rain, a most eerie sight. 
While we were watching 
these round white things explode, one of them came just 
below our tree tops, but I 
couldn't see where it landed. 
On one of our evergreens 
there was something that 
looked like spider webs, but 
had the consistency of spun 
glass; and next morning a 
long piece of "something" 
was plastered on the fender 
of my car." (CRIFO Orbit, 
III-9, Dec. 1956.) 

It seems incredible that a 
phenomenon of such wellmarked character, reported 
nearly a score of times since 
1949, should never have been 
observed prior to that time. 
But everyone who has looked 
into the data on unidentified 
flying objects knows how 



74 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



difficult it is to find unambiguous examples of the 
typical silvery-disk "flying 
saucer" earlier than the outbreak of June, 1947. The same 
is true of "angel hair." It 
may be that the phenomenon 
has really come into existence 
only within the last eight or 
ten years. 

However, we do find on 
record numerous examples 
of falls of cobwebby substance from the sky which in 
some ways so strikingly res e m b 1 e present-day "angelhair" falls that it seems not 
unreasonable to hazard the 
identification — even though 
sky objects are unmentioned. 
Here are several instances — 
mostly taken from Fort, but 
we quote in all cases from 
the original reference: 

September 21,1741, Selborne, England : Gilbert 
White, a renowned amateur 
naturalist, arose to find the 
countryside "matted all over 
with a thick coat of cobweb." 
About 9 a.m., "a second shower of cobwebs began to fall, 
and continued until the close 
of day." The material fell in 
"flakes or rags", "descending 
into sight on every side in a 
constant succession, and 
twinkling in the sun." It hung 
on trees and hedges "so 
thick, that a diligent person 
might have gathered baskets 
full." Though White was 
satisfied that it must have 
been "the production of small 
spiders" (significantly 
enough,- he makes no mention 
of having observed any such 



spiders), he remarks that 
"why their webs should all at 
once become so gross and 
material as to be consideruly 
more weighty than air, 
and to descend with precipitation, is past my skill." 
(Natural History of Selborne, 1789.) 

September 16, 1823, Bewdle3% England : Great quantities of webby substance, some 
in "branched filaments" up 
to 50 feet in length, some in 
"woolly films, or flocculi", 
fell from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
"The whole atmosphere 
seemed to be a tissue of cobwebs." Some of the material 
fell slowly, some more rapidly. (John Murray in Mem. 
Wernerian Nat. Hist. Soc, 5, 
388.) Although Murray's article is specifically concerned 
with gossamer spiders, he 
says nothing of having found 
any spiders in association 
with this "gossamer", whose 
fall he himself observed. 

October 1, 1826, vicinity of 
Liverpool, England : Fields 
covered for many miles with 
light, filmy substance, "mistaken by many persons for 
cotton", which fell thickly 
from the sky. Trees and 
lamp-posts festooned with 
the filaments, some many 
yards long. The "gossamer" 
was found to contain tiny 
flies, but no spiders. (London 
Times, Oct. 9, 1826.) 

Late October, 1881, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and 
places as much as 100 miles 
distant: A widespread fall of

"spiderwebs" in strands from 
two to sixty feet long, strong 
in texture and very white. 
"Curiously, there is no mention, in any of the reports 
that we have seen, of the 
presence of spiders." (Scientific American, 45 (1881), 
337.) 

November 21, 18<?3, Montgomery, Alabama : V/ eb-like 
substance in flakes and films 
up to 20 feet long "falling 
from trees and leaves to the 
ground." It was stated that 
the substance v/as not spiderweb, but resembed fine asbestos fibres; also that it 
"showed a phosphorescent effect." (Monthly Weather Review, 26 (1898), 566.) 

On the night of February 
20-21, 1955, a large quantity 
of "ragged sheets" and skeins 
of cobwebby grey fibres, 
some many feet in length, 
fell on an area half a mile 
square in Horseheads (near 
Elmira), New York. By the 
22nd, it was "disintegrating 
and disappearing." Because 
of the season (snow lay on 
the ground), it was not possible here to speak of "spider gossamer", and some fantastic explanations were put 
forward, accompanied by incredibly contradictory "analyses." Prof. Charles B. 
Rutenber of Elmira College's 
chemistry department, supported by Professor-Emeritus Francis Richmond, said 
his tests proved the material 
consisted of "extremely shortfibered cotton, heavily dam


aged in an explosion." He 
suggested that the stuff 
(which, contrary to newspaper headlines, was not radioactive) might have been 
carried in an atomic bombdebris cloud from Nevada, 
finally "knitting itself together" and falling out over 
this single quarter square 
mile in southern Horseheads! 
But the next day, John Diffenderfer, in charge of chemists at the nearby Westinghouse electronic-tube factory, 
said their analyses showed 
that the substance must 
have formed from powdered 
milk, presumably blown into 
the air from a flue at a nearby milk-processing plan t. 
Now, there is absolutely no 
chemical similarity between 
cotton (cellulose) and milk 
(a protein, like wool and 
spiderweb). 

The Atomic Energy Commission endorsed the milk 
theory, and conjured up an 
"explosion and fire in a local 
dairy" to account for it. To 
complete the comedy, two 
chemical technicians at the 
Dairylea milk plant flatly 
contradicted Diffenderfer and 
the AEC, asserting that the 
web consisted of a mixture of 
cotton and wool fibres — together with a few fragments 
of fine copper wire! Under 
the circumstances, it seems 
permissible to suppose that 
this web, as in some other instances, was partially or 
wholly of protein nature, and 
was called "milk" (or "wool") 
rather than "gossamer" sim

ply because gossamer spiders 
are not a thinkable explanation in February. (Elmira 
Star-Gazette, 2/22/55; N.Y. 
Journal-American, 2/22; N.Y. 
World-Telegram: 2/23, 3/8; 
FATE, Aug. 1955.) 

What regularities can we 
notice in these canes? Only 
two can be called invariable : 
the falling of the substance 
in rags, flakes, and skeins, 
rather than as isolated gossamer threads; and the complete absence of the multitude 
of spiders required to produce such a prodigious quantity of web. There is also an 
obvious concentration about 
the month of October, a circumstance which would harmonize with the spider theory 
if it were confined to the 
Northern Hemisphere; but it 
seems to be true also of the 
Southern Hemisphere, where 
October is a spring month. 
However, the Puente and 
Horseheads cases show that 
falls may also occur in midwinter. 

The volatility of "angel 
hair", e s p e c i a 1 ly when 
touched by human hands, is 
one of its most astonishing 
features, but it seems to be 
variable. Even in unquestionably "UFOgenic" cases, like 
that of Whitsett, N.C., it can 
go unremarked, and the fibres can be stable enough to 
handle and analyze; in others, as at Oloron, the material, is very fugitive. No odorless, volatile substance that 
could form silky filaments 



like this is known to chemistry; and one whose volatility 
is not always the same would 
be an even greater scientific 
anomaly. It is difficult to 
avoid lugging the spiritualists' "ectoplasm", and conjecturing that what happens 
may be not so much evaporation as "dematerialization" — 
whatever that may mean. 

Now, it seems that spherical objects of a similar "ectoplasmic" substance sometimes 
occur in the sky. One instance 
is the Philadelphia "purple 
sphere" of 1950 (FU, May 
issue), whose flimsy consistency and rapid dissolution 
on being touched irresistibly 
suggest that it was composed 
of "angel hair". A second is 
the Swedish 1803 observation 
of "gelatinous hat crowns" 
(ibid), whose rapid "drying 
up" was noted by the witnesses. (When "angel hair" disappears, according to witnesses, it first becomes gelatinous. This is probably not 
attributable simply to moisture picked up from the air, 
because touching the material 
causes almost immediate gelatinization.) A third example 
occurred shortly before the 
writing of this article: 

On March 20, 1957, in 
Charlotte, N.C., Mr. and 
Mrs. W. B. Brown were outdoors at 8:45 p.m. when five 
white objects "like bubbles— 
about the size of a basketball" came floating over the 
rooftops. They were nonluminous, and visible by re


SHAPES IN 

flection of the street lights. 
Four ' sailed off", but the 
fifth fell out of the group 
and dicpped to the street. It 
sounded like a thin sheet of 
ice slapping against the 
ground 1 ', said Brown. Where 
the object had splattered on 
the asphalt, they found a 
five-yard area wet with a 
serni-Iiquid substance that 
"felt slippery to the touch, 
like an alkaline solution" 
and was "cooling or numbing" 
to the touch. "It smelled sort 
of like burnt matches." (Charlotte Observer, March 22.) 

The similarity to the 
Swedish case is obvious, even 
to the "soapy" feeling. 

It is tempting to put all 
these incidents together, into 
some such speculative picture as this : 

In tits earth's stratosphere, 
there live large flocks of 
spherical entities or creatures, 
about six feet in diameter 
when fully grown, and of a 
very light, gelatinous composition, with a brightly silvery-white surface or skin. 
What keeps them aloft — 
whether a hydrogen bladder, 
or an actual antigravitic faculty — isn't known. These 
aerial "jellybirds", in contrast to marine jellyfish, are 
capable of great speed — 
though how they manage 
this is completely unknown. 
Astronomers occasionally catch sight of their migratory "hosts" crossing the sun. 
(We have no space here to 
cite the numerous recorded 



THE SKY 77 

descriptions of this phenomenon, which remind one of 
thai given by the Swedish 
ground observers of 1808. 

Ch;e astronomer, Eonitla, has 
photographed one of the objects, showing filray apoeridages.) Only rarely do they 
descend low enough to be 
seen from the ground. When 
(by mischance or illness) one 
falls to the ground and is 
killed, there is found a lump 
of soapy jelly, which soon 
disappears. Their migration 
and mating season, all over 
the world, is the months of 
September to November. At 
this period, they descend to 
lower altitudes (like marine 
fish returning to fresh water 
to spawn) and dance in 
groups, later in pairs; and 
they put forth webby tentacles like those photographed 
by Bonilla, which temporarily link their clusters together. These appendages 
are shed after mating, and 
descent to the ground as a 
fall of "angel hair." (It may 
be too that, as with many insects, the males die after 
mating.) Those that perish 
in mid-air, we may presume, 
usually burst open (cf. 1950 
Paradise, California case) 
and lose their moisture, leaving a cobwebby "skeleton" of 
angel hair, which evaporates 
before it reaches the ground 
(unless the death occurred at 
low altitude). The Philadelphia sphere may be regarded 
as the desiccated corpse of 
such a creature, which for

some reason had failed to 
burst, and had been "mummified" in its natural spherical 
form. Falls of angel hair outside of the autumn months 
are a sign of disasters among 
the denizens of the stratosphere. 

Such an hypothesis may be 
as far from the truth as the 
perversity of human wit can 
make it; it is unquestionably 
in conflict with present scientific view of what is possible. But it would account 
for a great many observations 
in a persuasively "natural" 
way. The behaviour of many 
UFOs, including those that 
have emitted angel hair, compellingly suggests that of living beings, rather than piloted machines. Such qualified 
students of the problem as

by WILLIAM GERKEN 



When he opened the door to 
the shed that day, and saw 
the axe suspended in mid-air, 
he understood what was wrong. 



HE HAD been living with 
us for a week before I found 
out he was a Lifter. Even the 
discovery was an accident. I 
had started for the store, but 
then remembered a chore I 
wanted him to do. I heard the 
sounds of wood-chopping 
coming from the shed, so I 
went behind the house to the 
small wooden structure. I 
must have gasped or something, because he turned 
around to look at me, dropping the axe he had poised 
over a block of wood as he 
turned. Only he hadn't been 
holding the axe; it had been 
hanging in mid-air without 
support. 

The first time I saw him 
v/as when he knocked on my 
door. I don't think I'll ever 
forget how he looked— tall 
and thin, old clothes and older shoes, an unruly mop of 
blond hair. It was only when I 
looked at his face that I realized that he was more than a 
mere boy of eighteen or ninetsen. The tired lines around 
his mouth, the sad, mature 
look in his eyes, the stoop already evident in his young 
shoulders; he had been forced 
to mature too quickly, and 
seemed to have knowledge a

boy his age had no right to be 
burdened with. 

"I — I was wondering if I 
might get a bite to eat, sir," 
he said. 

I grinned. No matter how 
he looked, he was no different from anyone else his age 
where food was concerned. 
"Sure; come on in and rest a 
spell," I told him. Marty, cz.n 
you fix a plate of something? 
We've got a guest." Marty — 
my wife — glanced through the 
kitchen doorway. After a cursory look at the boy, she 
smiled at him and went back 
to work. 

"Sit down, son, you leak 
pretty done-in. Come far today?" 

He nodded. "Guess it 
shows, huh?" he paid, brushing the read dust from his 
trousers. 

"Uh-huh. Where you from? 
Not around here. I know." 

"Far back as I can remember, Oregon has been home." 

It wasn't hard to guess why 
he was almost a thousand 
miles from home. During the 
war, over ten million American families had been separated, their way of life destroyed 
by the hell of atomic bombings. Ever since its end, people had been seeking their 
loved ones; many, only to 
find them dead or dying. 
Sometimes the searches 
stretched across continents or 
oceans. In that respect the 
boy sitting opposite me was 
no different from hundreds 
of others I've seen in the past 



ten years. The only difference 
was in his face. 

"Looking for your family," 
I said, making it a statement. 

"Yessir." He smiled, as 
though the sentence had double meaning. 

After he had eaten, he went 
down to the town store to 
look through its records. 
They all do. They turn the 
ppges of the big stopover 
book, hoping a relative or 
friend had parsed through the 
same town. Then they »?gn 
the book, pi-.t down the date 
and where they're headed, and 
set out oice more. Almost all 
towns have stopove r books 
nowadays, and- a good thing, 
too. They helped ne find 
Marty back in '63, when the 
truce was finally signed. In 
fpet, I found her'ripbt here in 
this town. We got married, 
settled down, and haven't 
hem more than a hundred 
miles a-"?_y smce then. 

Martha called me into the 
kitchen a'most as soon as he 
was gone. "He's a nice boy." 

"That be is," I agreed. "You 
know, I've been thinking: we 
could use a younr fe35a 
rround here to help with the 
work," 

"If he'll stay. There was 
something in his eyes; a sort 
of longing for someone very 
close to him. That kind usually takes off after a night's 
rest." 

"I know. Guess I'll drop by 
the store; see if I can talk 
him into staying."

By the time I reached the 
store, school was out, and a 
group of kids were gathered 
around him, listening to his 
description of the Rocky 
Mountains, which he had 
crossed during the summer. 
The kids weren't the only 
ones listening. Even the 
adults were standing around 
in the store, remembering the 
places they had once seen 
themselves, and getting such 
bits of news as he dropped 
about the other towns he had 
parsed through. The Searchers are, ne~t to the town radio 
stations, the only source of 
information we have now, so 
it's no wonder they're so 
warmly greeted wherever they 
stop. 

Soon as he'd finished tellimg about the Rockies, I said 
we'd appreciate it if he would 
stay for supper. He said he 
would, and later, while he and 
Tommy, my eight-year-old 
son, and I were walking home, 
I asked him if he'd stay with 
us for awhile. 

For a moment he looked 
v,.'3tful, as if wishing he 
c.r-'jld stay here, and forget 
v, soever he was trying to 
find. Then he smiled and said, 
thanks, he would stay for a 
week or so. 

He was real helpful, too, 
cutting stove and fireplace 
wood for the coming winter 
running errands, hunting for 
game animals, and teaching at 
the school. Almost all Searchers teach when they can be 
persuaded to stay in town for 



a spell. Since there are no 
more colleges to produce 
teachers, anyone who knows 
something uselul takes a turn 
at teaching. 'Fore the war, I 
was a mathematics major in 
college, so twice a week I 
teach all kinds of math at 
school, from numbers through 
calculus. Mostly, Searchers 
teach about what the places 
they had passed through are 
like. 

Then, when I opened the 
door to the shed that day, and 
saw the axe suspended in 
mid-air, I suddenly realized 
why he had that sad, tired 
look about him all the time. 

He picked up the axe from 
where it had fallen, and stood 
it against the wall. Reaching 
for his jacket, he said, "I — I 
guess I'd better be moving 
along, Mr Tranton. I'm really sorry if I've caused you 
any trouble." He started past 
me for the door. 

"Hold on, son." I grabbed 
his arm. "Why the rush?" 

"I don't want to cause you 
any trouble. Now that you 
know what I am — " he grit the 
'words out bitterly, "the word 
will get around. I wouldn't 
want the others in town to be 
angry with you because of 
me. You and Mrs. Tranton 
have been swell to me. Thanks 
for everything." He tried to 
pull his arm loose, but I held 
fast 

"Let's go inside and have a 
cup of coffee," I suggested. "I 
don't know about the other 
towns you've been through,

but here we don't hate a person because he might happen 
to have powers we don't." 

"Yesterday I was down at 
the store, and I heard one of 
the men sounding off about 
us," he said. "He didn't sound 
like he cared much for us." 

"Must have been John Atherson. He never could understand ESP, and he blames the 
war on it. We just let him 
talk; can't change a person 
like that." We went up the 
back steps and through the 
door into the kitchen. "Go on, 
show Marty," I said, taking 
off my jacket. 

He looked at me to make 
sure I meant it. Then he 
raised the coffee pot from the 
stove, and watched it move 
across the room under its own 
power to the table where I 
was sitting. Leaving the pot 
in mid-air, he made the cupboard open, and still standing 
in the middle of the room, 
floated three cups and saucers to the table. Then he got 
the cream, sugar and three 
spoons, put them on the table, and pr.tred the coffee. 
Marty waic'-sd the coffee pot 
move back to the stove, her 
mouth open in amazement, "I 
heard of it, but I don't think 
I'd have believed it if I hadn't 
seen it." I nodded, and she 
smiled at him. "Now that I 
know," she said, "I'm even 
gladder you chose to stay 
here for- awhile." 

He grinned. "Thanks." He 

sac form v?ith -U3 at the table, 



and stirred some sugar into 
his coffee. 

"It must be hard on you," 
Marty said quietly, in a knowing way. "Are you really looking for your family, or for 
others with ESP?" 

"My father was killed during the bombings. After that, 
Mom and I were alone. She 
only had a little talent; Dad 
and I were the ones who were 
really adept. Anyway, we 
stayed on the small farm we 
owned until last spring. Then 
mom married again, and I was 
free to leave. I think her new 
husband was sorry to see me 
go, because it meant a lot of 
manual work for him that I 
had been doing an easier way. 
I decided to see if I couldn't 
find any others like myself, 
so I left and started across 
the country." 

"Do you have any other 
powers, or can you just control things?" Marty asked. 

He grinned. "If you mean, 
am I an all-around superman, 
no. Dad wasn't either. I do 
have a scattering of other psi 
talents, though, but nothing 
as well-developed as my telekinesis. I'm still working on 
them." 

Tommy came in from 
school just then. "Could you 
teach him how to use his mind 
that way, or do you have to 
be born with it?" I said. 

He smiled again. "No, you 
don't have to be born with it. 
Everyone could do it if they 
started training themselves 
young enough to use their

minds to the fullest extent. 
All through history certain 
people have had strange powers. The trouble was, they 
were thought to be freaks instead of the better developed 
humans they actually were. 
Even now, we're only on the 
threshhold of learning the 
full power of the mind." He 
turned to Tommy. "Would 
you like to learn how to do 
things, Tommy?" 

"Sure. Like what?" 

He glanced at Marty and 
me. "Like making the world a 
better place to live." 

Two weeks later, at a meeting of the town council, I 
wasn!t too worried about getting the proposal accepted. 
We might have some trouble 
with Atherson, but I figured 
between the two of us we 
could handle him. When the 
new business came up, I stood 
up and led Tommy to the 
front of the hall. There were 
a few whispers as we went, as 
children under fifteen aren't 
allowed in the hall during a 
council meeting. 

"Tommy has something to 
say to you which, I think, will 
interest everyone here. Go on, 
son." 

Seconds afterwards, we all 
heard a clear "Hello," but not 
with our ears ; the word came 
from inside our heads. 

Someone said : "The kid's a 
telepath," and the silence was 
broken. 

Everybody was talking at 
the same time. 

"I suppose you think it's an 



honor to have one of them 
damn things for your son," 
Atherson yelled. "I'm glad 
you're the one who got stuck, 
and not me." 

"Tommy was not born a 
telepath, John," I told him. 
"He has been deliberately^ 
trained to make use of the latent power in his brain. And I 
don't think I'm 'stuck' either. 
We all know we've been slowly slipping into retrogression 
ever since '63. None of us 
like it, but there isn't anything we can do to halt it — 
yet. We don't want our children, or their children, to 
keep slipping backwards. If 
we don't stop it in our lifetime, we may not be able to 
stop it at all. 

"As I see it, the best chance 
we have to at least achieve a 
status quo is to accept the 
aid those among us with psi 
talents are willing to give. After all, it's their world, too. 
With their help, we may be 
able to build a better civilization, one without the sociopolitical diseases that led to 
the war. 

"The young man who has 
been staying at my house for 
the past three weeks taught 
Tommy to do what he just 
did. He says he thinks he can 
do it with any child under ten 
years old, and is even willing 
to try it with some teen-agers. 
Of course, Tommy's training 
has just begun. He will keep 
on learning for years. 

"Here's my idea. If some of 
the children get a grounding

in how to develop their dormant brain power, by the time 
they're twenty, they'll be able 
to mold a new society, one 
geared to the present culture 
instead of the past traditions. 
How about it?" 

I waited. For a minute there 
was silence. Finally one o£ 
the older men stood up. "Is 
he sure he can do it?" 

"All we know is it worked 
with Tommy," I replied. 

"I don't like it; it's unnatural," Atherson said. 

"No one asked you to like 
it," some one said. 

Another called: "Do you 
think three world wars in fifty years ;s natural? Let's take 
a vote." 

A vote was taken, and it 
was decided to add an extra 
class for those children whose 
parents wanted them to attend. After a month, the 
council would expect a report 
on what progress — or lack of 
it — had been made. 

A few weeks later, 
when my math class was over, 
I hung around to watch the 
new class. It was divided into 
small groups, each training on 
a different psi talent. One 
group was lifting pencils and 
gently returning them to 
desks by telekinesis. Another 
wss sitting quietly, once in a 
while breaking into shouts of 
laughter; probably telepathy. 
Tb:;re v/ere other groups, but 
I dli 't.know enough about 
f " t -'ents to identify their 



During the time he was 
teaching, he met a girl. They 
spent quite a bit of time together, and she joined the 
special class. By the time the 
report to the council came 
due, it wasn't hard to tell they 
were in love. 

Just about everyone in town 
turned out for that meeting. 
The boys and girls who were 
taking the class were seated 
at the front of the hall. The 
report was first on the agenda, so the kids could go home 
to bed. 

"When we started," he 
said, "I asked those children 
who weren't interested, or 
who were — urn — unsuited to 
the work, to leave. Then we 
ran through a general training exercise, and after a week, 
I split the class up into 
groups. Each group was to 
concentrate on one talent, but 
general sessions for the entire 
class give everyone practice 
in all talents. I think we've 
made fairly good progress. 
Some of the older teen-agers 
have shown an interest in the 
talents (he glanced at his 
girl), and although progress 
has not been as rapid as with 
the younger children, they are 
sufficiently developed to help 
instruct. Now your children 
are going to demonstrate 
what they have learned." 

For the next half hour we 
watched Tommy and fourteen 
other boys and girls work. 
Tommy and the others who 
had concentrated on telepathy 
read silently to us from 



STOPOVER 



85 



. books and talked .to each other, projecting their thoughts 
so we could also listen in. 
The telekinesis group all 
worked together to build a 
small table. All the necessary 
materials were stacked at the 
front of the room. The kids 
sat in a half circle, their 
brows furrowed in concentration as lumber, nails and 
hammers moved under the 
guidance of their minds. 
When they had finished, the 
table was complete, even to 
the sanding and a coat of varnish. 

Finally, the only one with 
precognition — a girl about six 
years old, with long blonde 
hair— gave the weather forecast for the next two weeks. 
Copies of her prediction were 
passed out to us, so we could 
check her accuracy. 

Once the kids were gone, he 
Stood up again. "I hope you 
are all convinced as to what 
can be accomplished through 
the use of psi. The talents can 
and should be used for the 
betterment of society, not for 
carnival side shows. Of 
course, there are more than 
those just demonstrated. Unfortunately, I couldn't find 
them present in this group. I 
was hoping for either a healer 
or a sensitive, but no one had 
the necessary ability. 
_ "If you want the class continued, the decision is yours. 
Thanks for having open 
minds, and for giving me a 
chance." He picked up his 
jacket and walked out. 



Atherson didn't bother to 
come to the meeting, so the 
vote to continue the class was 
unanimous. 

He stayed on, teaching part 
time, helping out with the 
work at my place, and seeing 
his girl. Then, one afternoon 
two weeks after the council 
meeting, she came to see me. 
"You've got to stop him, Mr. 
Tranton," she said. "He's going to leave. He told me he 
was going right after he finished the class today. He's 
probably down at the store 
right now, buying things to 
take with him. You've got to 
make him stay." 

"Why?" I asked quietly, 
watching the tears well up in 
her eyes. She hadn't lost" her 
composure yet, but she felt so 
strongly about him she was 
on the verge of breaking 
down. 

"Because I love him and he 
loves me," she retorted. 
"That's -why. Won't you talk 
to him? At least get him to 
take me with him. Please." 

"You said you love him. 
Would you rather he stayed 
here, and was never fully happy, or left to continue searching, maybe to return someday, 
ready to settle down? If you 
really love him there's no 
question." 

"Couldn't he take me with 
him?" 

I shook my head. "I don't 
think you should even ask 
him to take you. You'd be a 
burden that would slow him 
down. He'd worry about you, 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



have to get your food, find 
shelter for you. He might let 
you go with him, but don't ask 
him to. He's too young to be 
tied down. Now go on, and 
wish him good luck and kiss 
him goodbye. He's coming up 
the road now." 

She glanced out the open 
window, jumped up, and ran 
out into the sunlight, to wait 
at the side of the road. I 
picked up the book I had been 
reading, but the window was 
too close to the road for me 
to concentrate on the pages. 
She didn't say anything until 
he was standing before her. 

"I'll be waiting," she said. 
"Take care of yourself." 

He nodded. "I have to go," 
he told her. "Partly because it 
was Dad's last wish, partly because I need others of my 
own kind. Alone, we can't 
help the world much ; together, there's a good chance for 
result':.. I left a letter for the 
council saying you were going to take over the class, because you have the ability to 
carry on. Watch Cathy, and 
help her all you can. She's got 
it ; her weather forecast 
proved that much. You've got 
to drum that into her; never 
let her forget it. Maybe I'll 
be back — I hope so. But first, 
I have to find others. I need 



them, and they might need 
me. We're still not completely self-sufficient. 

"Give -the kids my love, and 
keep them at it. Just don't 
forget they are kids. Give 
them a chance to grow up as 
normally as possible. That's 
a chance I didn't have." 

He kissed her tenderly, then 
started off down the road. 
When he reached the crest of 
the hill, he turned and waved. 
Marty joined me at the doorway, and we waved too. Outlined against the bright blue 
afternoon sky, he stood immobile for a moment. To many, 
he would have been just a 
young man with a tired-out 
face; but to me, the symbol of 
a better life for Tommy and 
his children. ..a life unmarred by the threat of instant death as punishment for 
something he had little control over. 

He's gone now, but the 
work will go on, and the Athersons of the world will come 
to realize he is giving us 
another chance, a chance we 
don't really deserve. Somehow 
he reminds me of another 
man. A man who said: "Suffer the little children to come 
unto me, and forbid them not; 
for of such is the kingdom of 
God." 



the 
Tunrare 
earths 

by ISAAC ASIMOV 

What are these rare earth 
metals and what part can 
they play in our lives today 
and in the years to come? 



THE WORK that led to 
the atom bomb also helped 
liberate fourteen metals from 
useless slavery to an unjust 
name. 

The early chemists, it 
seems, called certain nonmetallic substances "earths." 
These "earths" showed little 
or no solubility in water and 
could be heated red-hot without melting or changing. The 
name was rather a good one, 
because the earth itself, or at 
least the outer crust of the 
earth, was made up mainly of 
five "earths". These were the 
oxides of silicon, aluminum, 
iron, calcium and magnesium. 
Singly and in combination, 
they make up 90 per cent of 
the earth's crust. 

Of these "earths", magnesium oxide ("magnesia") and 
calcium oxide ("lime") do 
dissolve a bit in water and the 
solutions show definite alkaline properties. These were 
therefore called "the alkaline 
earths". In 1808, the alkaline 
earths were broken down and 
the metals, magnesium and 
calcium, separated in reasonably pure form. Naturally, 
they were called "the alkaline 
earth metals". When other 



Dr. Isaac Asimov, prominent biochemist and science fiction writer, here 
discusses the group of fourteen metallic elements tlmt, until recently, 
were grouped together as "the rare earth metals", and what happened 
to these neglected metals in. these days of research on uranium fission. 



87 



83 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



elements chemically similar 
to magnesium and calcium 
were discovered (including 
beryllium, strontium, barium, 
and radium) they, too, were 
lumped under that classification. 

About 1800, certain minerals were discovered in Scandinavia which contained oxides that had the properties 
o£ "earth s". These new 
"earths", however, were much 
less common than were magnesium oxide and calcium oxide and so they were called 
"the rare earths" by way of 
comparison. By 1907, a series 
of fourteen metallic elements 
had been isolated from the 
rare earths. They were called 
"the rare earth metals." 

To begin with, how rare, 
really, are the rare earths? 
How just is this name? In 
Table I, I list the occurrence 
of each of the rare earth metils in the soil in parts per 
million (the number of 
pounds, that is, for every 
million pounds of the earth's 
crust). In Table II, I list for 
comparison the concentrat-on 
of some other elements which 
K13-" not be among the most 
common but are at least familiar and useful and used in 
fa*r Quantities. 

The total for all the ra-e 
earth metals comes to nearly 
120 parts per million. This is 
over 50 per cent more than 
the amount of copper in the 
woiU. .Cerium, the most com— ' " r?.ve earth metals, 



is just about as common as 
tin. It is two and a half times 
as common as lead. Neodyrnium and lanthanum are 
each more common than lead. 
Even the rarest rare earth 
metal, thulium, is almost as 
common as iodine and two 
hundred times as common as 
gold. 

Yet the rare earth metals, 
despite the fact that they are 
not so very rare after all, 
have been neglected by mankind. Their uses are very 
minor. 

For instance, a mixture of 
the rare earth metals is called 
"misch metal" which is German for "mixed metal". It is 
half cerium and the rest is 
mostly lanthanum and neodymium. It is alloyed with iron 
to form c i g a r e 1 1 e-lighter 
flints, because the alloy gives 
off particularly hot sparks 
when struck. 

Cerium oxide is added to 
glass to keep it colorless and 
to remove the green tinge 
that might result from the 
presence of iron. In powder 
form, it is used to polish 
glass. Neodymium oxide is 
added to glass to give a purple color which is useful in 
safety goggles, protecting 
against the glare of growing 
metnl or glass. Lanthanum 
oxide is used in arc ligliM 
and in the manufacture of 
special kinds of optical glass. 

That's about all of any importance. A pretty poor score 
for fourteen metals. 



THE UNRARE EARTHS 



89 



How much of this neglect 
is due to the unfortunate 
word "rare"? Certainly, the 
rare earth mstals are neglected in chemistry classes 
and hardly ever mentioned 
or discussed (except for the 
interesting electron structure 
of their atoms, but that is 
another story.) Chemistry 
students never think of them 
except as "rare"' elements 
with funny names, probably, 
and if they enter chemistry 
as a profession, they are not 
likely to think of working 
with the rare earth elements. 

Sometimes, it is said that 
the rare earth elements are 
really rare, even if considerable quantities are present in 
the soil. They are spread 
thin, you see, so that pockets 
of profitable ore are not easily found. This used to be 
said about uranium ores, too. 
However, once we decided 
that uranium was important 
and had to be found, we 
found more pockets of ore 
than we expected, and we 
learned how to make even 
poor ores worth-while. (Uranium, by the way, is less 
common than bs'f tbe rare 
e^rth elements. It is only 
-i-iih as common as cerium.") 

A more serious atH fiction is 
that once you get your ban Is 
on some of the rare earth elements, the trouble rea/Zy 
starts. You see. all tbe rare 
earth elements are .very similar chemically. As tbe earth's 
crur-t hardcBcd, tr>'«3 v?.'-'ous 



rare earth elements crystallized out in the same places 
and in the same wa3 r s. Rocks 
that contain compounds of 
any of the rare earth elements contain them all. 

Well, how do we separate 
elements that nature could 
not. Before World War II, it 
was done by a process known 
as "fractional crystallization." 

The mixture of rare earth 
metals in the form of a particular type of compound is 
dissolved in an appropriate 
liquid. This liquid is slowly 
boiled away and as this happens, the rare earth compounds begin to precipitate 
as crystals. The compounds 
of the various rare earth metals differ slightly from one 
another in solubility and the 
least soluble crystallize out 
first. The first batch of crystals is removed : another 
patch forms and is removed 
and so on. 

Each batch of crystals is 
far from pure, but if each 
batch is dissolved and the 
process is repeated, that 
helps. Each crystallization 
leaves behind some left-over 
solvent (called "mother-liquor") with a portion of the 
compounds still dissolved in 
it. Certai.n'motker-liq'.iors are 
coaibined with certain batches of crystals according to a 
definite system, and the process is repeated over an^ 
over. Eventual'.,', the reasonably ntire c ' — *! the 



90 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



various rare earth metals are 
separated. 

I say, eventually. Sometimes, 40,000 separate crystallizations are required. 

The time and patience required was unbelievable. Can 
you wonder that before 
World War II, hardly anything was known of the 
properties of the rare earth 
metals? That hardly any uses 
were found for them? That 
chemists kept thinking of 
them as "rare"? 

Then came the wartime research on uranium fission. 
It turned out that some of the 
products of fission were 
radioactive isotopes of at 
least six of the rare earth elements. It was very important to identify and study 
these. In order to be studied, 
they had to be separated 
from one another. What's 
more, the separation had to 
be fast, as the isotopes were 
breaking down continuously. 
There was no time for 40,000 
recrystallizations. 

Beginning in 1942, then, 
use was made of ion-exchange resins. These are brittle amber-like substances 
with large organic molecules. 
Each resin molecule contains 
a number of acid groups 
that can combine with atoms 
of the different rare earth 
metals to form salts. 

The ion-exchange resin, in 
the form of little pellets, is 
put into a long vertical glass 
tube and -a solution of rare 
earth compounds is allowed 



to trickle down through the 
resin. The resin captures the 
rare earth metals at once. The 
metals remain at the top of 
the column. The liquid that 
comes out at the bottom of 
the column (which is, of 
course, equipped with a stopcock) has no rare earth metals 
in it. 

The next step is to run a 
solution containing ammonium citrate and citric acid 
down the column. The citric 
acid will combine with the 
rare earth metals just as the 
resin will. There is a kind of 
a tug of war for the atoms of 
the rare earth metals. As the 
citric acid trickles downward, they are pulled along 
with it somewhat. 

Furthermore, the tug of 
war is differently balanced 
for each particular rare 
earth metal. Those with higher atomic numbers are more 
strongly attracted by the 
citric acid than the others and 
follow a little faster as the 
citric acid trickles downward. Each rare earth metal 
follows at its own particular 
rate. If the column is long 
enough, this means they 
gradually move away from 
one another and separate 
completely. (It is just like 
runners in a race, who start 
from the same position, but 
who separate more and more 
as the race progresses, the 
fastest runners forging out 
front.) 

By the time the rare earth 
metals trickle out the bottom 



THE UNRARE EARTHS 



91 



of the tube, each can be up to 
99.9 per cent pure. 

The rare earth metal situation has thus been revolutionized. At least two plants 
now exist which can supply 
sizable quantities of any rare 
earth metal you wish at a reasonable price and in a high 
state of purity. Chemists are 
beginning to discover that a 
bit of this rare earth metal or 
that added to certain alloys 
result in improved properties 
of one kind or another. 



It may not be long before 
we'll be using rare earth metals in every day objects of 
all sorts and wonder that 
they were ever considered 
rare or useless. 

As a matter of fact, the 
name "rare earth" is already 
completely out of fashion. 
Up-to-date chemists refer to 
the elements as the "lanthanides" after the name of the 
first metal of the series. 
They're "unrare earths" now, 
you see.

Robbie whined and acted like 
his eyes were burning, as if 
he'd gotten dust or.something 
even stranger into them .... 



ZACK STEWART r.tered 
sleepily into the bottom of 
his cracked coffee cup as his 
wife began to gather the 
breakfast dishes. 

Mrs. Stewart was a huge, 
methodical woman, seasoned 
to the drudgery of a farm 
wife. Quite methodically 
she'd arise every morning at 
4 :00 A.M. with her husband 
and each would do their respective chores until long 
cfter the sun had set on their 
forty acre farm. 

"You've jest got to find 
Junius today, Zack," Mrs. 
Stewart spoke worriedly, 
"Lord only knows her condition, not being milked since 
yesterday morning." 

"Yeah, I know, M?," Zack 
said wearily as he rose from 
the table, "I'll search for her 
a^ain in the north woods, but A 
if she ain't there this time, I 
give up." 

A dog suddenly howled 
outside. There was a brief instant when neither moved, 
then Z?.ck suddenly exclaimed, "It's Robbie!" and 
dashed outside. 

In the light from the open 
doorway Zack saw the dog 



This is NOT a story about sinister aliens from outer space. This is 
simply the story of what happened to poor Junius when she found herself much too close to a Flying Saucer, long enough so she could be analyzed and long enough to cause some stranrte happenings on that farm.

brightness extended down 
through the trees from the 
sky, on the other side of the 
woods. He approached cautiously as the light grew 
brighter, and came to the 
clearing where it was mor.t intense. A. thick bush obstructed his view, and Zack moved 
it aside then uttered a hoarse 
gasp, as he clutched at his 
eyes. 

For a moment he felt he 
was dreaming. He squinted 
between the slits of his fingers. The glow was still piercing, but he could see the 
brightly lit Junius, radiating 
blue-white light, nibbling at 
the sparse grass in the clearing. Zack stood transfixed, 
his eyes widening behind his 
fingers. He felt the tears and 
the burning sensation, and 
squinted tightly, turning his 
head from the unbelievable 
scene. 

Zack didn't remember his 
return to the farmhouse, or 
incoherently trying to explain to his wife the scene he 
had witnessed. A stiff jolt of 
elderberry wine drove off the 
jitters and reasoning returned. His wife sat patiently, eyeing him oddly, as Zack 
muttered over and over again, 
"It's unbelievable! It's unbelievable !" 

Mrs. Stewart rose. "I'm going out and see fer myself. 
And Zack, if yer lying to 
me—" 

Zack jumped from the 
chair, barring her way. 



"Believe me, maw, it's true. 
Don't go out there. It might 
be too much fer ya." 

"It's the craziest thing I 
ever heard." Mrs. Stewart 
scoffed, "A cow that shines 
like the sun!" 

"Look, maw, will ya. jest 
come with me as fer as the 
pasture, you can see the glow 
from there, and mebbe that 
might convince ya." 

"Yes, yes I will," Mrs. 
Stewart jerked off her apron, 
"I declare Zack, I think these 
chores are getting the best of 

ya." 

They walked to the pasture, 
their eyes on the tree tops of 
the north woods. A faint glow 
began to appear. 

"See! See!" Zack pointed, 
laughing crazily. 

"Let's get closer, looks like 
a fire." Mrs. Stewart said. 

"Ain't no fire," Zack's tone 
was angry, "It's Junius and 
she's all lit up like a Christmas tree." 

"Zack, now you stop that 
kinda crazy talk. There's a 
reason behind everything, 
and I'm sure there's one fer 
this." 

"There is a reason, maw. 
Junius. She's got the whole 
clearing lit up like the noon 
day sun. Lord only knows 
how she got that way, but 
she's shining out there like a 
great big light bulb, only 
brighter." 

Mrs. Stewart quickened her 
pace towards the clearing. 

"I'm going to see fer myself," she said determinedly, 



THE SHINING COW 



95 



"and put an end to this foolish nonsense." 

"Alright, maw," Zack spoke 
resignedly, "if yer mind's set. 
But I'm warning ya, ya better 
squint yer eyes tight. She's 
too bright to look at. Poor 
Robbie must have got too 
good a look at her." 

Mrs. Stewart approached 
the clearing ahead of her husband and moved the same bush 
aside, that had obstructed her 
husband's view. Ker gaze 
caught the brightly radiating 
figure of Junius, and Mrs. 
Stewart screamed, clasping 
her face with her hands. Zack 
had his head turned, but he 
groped for his wife, grasped 
her arm and led her from the 
clearing. 

It's too crazy to believe 
Zack," she whispered in awe; 
"What are we going to do? 
What has happened to poor 
Junius?" 

"I don't know what happened to her," Zack answered," but I know what 
I'm going to do about it. I'm 
going to call the University 
and git them scientist fellas 
down here." 

"You suppose they can git 
close enough to milk the poor 
thing?" Mrs. Stewart' clasped 
her hands in frustration, 
"she's probably in misery." 

f Zack shook his head. "Ain't 
no tellin' what they're liable 
to .do after they seen her. 
Most likely they'll want to 
ship her to the Univsrr.'iy to 



examine her and see how she 
got that way." 

"Why don't we call the 
Vet'nar'n?" Mrs. Stewart 
asked, "it might be some kind 
of new disease." 

"It ain't no disease, maw. 
It's something nobody in the 
whole world ever seen or 
heard of before. I jest hope I 
can convince them University 
fellas to come down here." 

"Don't you think you better tie Junius so she won't 
stray?" 

"Better wait and see what 
them scientists say. Besides, 
if she strays, all we gotta 
do is follow the light!" 

Zack did the most important chores and at eight A.M. 
on the dot he called the 
State University. 

The operator at the switchboard answered sleepily. 

"Good morning, State University." 

"Mornin' man. I'd like to 
talk to one of them scientist 
fellas." 

"To whom in particular did 
you wish to speak?" 

"Any of 'em that ain't busy. 
I got somethin' important to 
tell 'em." 

"If I knew what it was 
about," the operator was becoming irritated, "I'd connect you with the right 
party." 

Zack hesitated, reluctant to 
give his startling news to a 
mere operator. Instead, he 

hedged. "Wall, who would 



<J6 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



have charge of things that 
light up?" 

"Oh, you want the electrical engineering lab.. Just a 
moment sir." 

There was a series of clicks 
and buzzes in the earpiece 
then Zack heard a man's deep 
voice. 

"Hello." 

"Hello," Zack replied, "this 
the electrical engineering 
lab?" 

"Yessir, that's right." 

"Well, my name is Zack 
Stewart and I own a forty 
acre farm on the Canal Road 
just outside of Smithville." 

"I'm Professor Donnell, can 
I help you?" 

"Yeath," Zack took a deep 
breath then began, "my cow 
Junius was missing since 
yesterday morning and this 
morning when I went out to 
search for her again, I found 
her." 

"Mr. Stewart," Professor 
Donnell's voice was impatient, "I'm a very busy man 
with a heavy class schedule. 
Why in the world would I 
care if you found your cow 
or not?" 

"You'd c?"e if you knew 
how I found her." 

"Alright, Mr. Stewart, "how 
did you find your cow, with 
so*rte new k-'nd of radar?" 

"Nossir, I found her by 
following the bright light in 
the north wood and when I 
fot there, there was Junius 
lit up lik* a neon si^n." 

"Mr. Stewart, are you 
drunk?" 



"I knew you wouldn't believe me. All I can say is, 
come see for — " 

Zack heard a sudden click 
then an immediate buzzing. 
Professor Donnell had hung 
up. 

He had no sooner replaced 
the phone when there was a 
pounding on the door. He 
opened it and saw six state 
troopers and four important 
looking gentlemen in civilian 
dress. A trooper who looked 
as though he might be in 
charge, spoke to Zack. 

"Sir, we don't want you or 
your wife to get panicky, but 
we have reason to believe 
that something strange is going on in your woods. These 
men are from the atomic research laboratory at the University and they are convinced that a flying saucer 
has landed out there." 

"It ain't no flying saucer." 
Zack spoke wearily. 

"It isn't?" one of the gentlemen asked, disappointed, 
"then what is it?" 

"It's Junius, my cow." 

"Your — WHAT ?" the state 
trooper exclaimed incredulously, "are you nuts?" 

Angrily, Zack jerked his 
thumb in the direction of the 
north woods. 

"Jest go out there and see 
fer yourself and then tell me 
I'm nuts." 

They hurriedly left the 
house, looking back skeptically at Zack. 



THE SHINING COW 



97 



Zack and his v/ife stood in 
the doorway, watching them 
until they were out of sight 
in the wooes. 

"You w 3. t. c h 'em come 
busting back here in a 
minute, maw." 

In a few moments they saw 
the men scrambling out of 
the woods, rushing madly for 
the house, holding their eyes. 

"Now I don't have to convince any bod y." Zack 
smirked. 

By the time they reached 
the por:h, they were all talking excitedly and rubbing 
their eyes. The state trooper 
in charge Dulled Zack aside. 

"Mister," he asked ominously, "what the hell happened 
to that cow?" 

"I don't know," Zack spoke 
with sarcasm, "jest the way 
I found her." 

The important looking civilian bustled past the patrolman and confronted Zack. 

"I'd like to use your 
phone," his hands moved 
nervously, "where is it?" 

Zack showed him and the 
man rushed to it and hastily 
dialed, a number. 

"This is Professor Jonathon Simr-. Nuclear Physicist 
at State University. Put me 
through immediately to the 
Governor. It's very important." 

There was a rU'-ht pau=e 
as Sims drummed impatiently on the phone. 
- "Hello! Hello, Povernor? 
Professor Sim 5 !. I'd like a 
contingent of National 



Guardsmen around the farm 
of Zack Stewart on the old 
Canal Rd. A most astonding 
thing has happened out here. 
For the welfare of the Public, I urgently request 
this farm be placed under 
tight security check at once 
and the Federal Government 
notified immediately." 

"Hey now, wait a minute 
Mister — " Zack protested. 

Sims motioned him into 
silence, his ear glued to the 
phone. 

"Sir," he hesitated, glancing at the group sideways, 
"you won't believe this until 
you see it. But we have positive proof a saucer has landed 
here. Mr. Stewart's cow is 
radiating intense blue and 
white light, the kind that has 
been associated with the glow 
of flying saucers." 

Sims paused, listening to 
the Governor. Zack saw him 
fidsret and stick a forefinger 
in his collar. 

"Honestly Sir! I am not 
drunk! The cow is radiating 
light." 

"See?" Zack grinned at 
him. "now ya know how I 
felt." 

Sims ignored him, concentrating on the phone. 

"Yessir, there is a State 
Trooper, here." He turned 
to the one in charge. "He 
wants to speak to you." The 
Trooper took the receiver. 

"Hello Governor. Sgt. Les 
Johnson of the Highway Patrol." Pi*use. "That's right sir. 
There's jl number of people 



98 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



here who can swear to it. 
Yessir." This time the Trooper fidgeted. "I seen it too. 
Blue-white light, yessir. Nossir, we are not having a drinking party. The light was reported by the pilot of the 
Continental Airways early 
this morning and we investigated. Yessir/' He held the 
receiver towards Sims. "He 
wants to talk to you again." 

The Governor was finally 
convinced something indeed 
strange was happening at the 
Stewart place, but being a 
solid citizen and faithful servant of the people who elected him, he couldn't believe 
the fantastic story the Professor and the Trooper told 
him. He decided to see for 
himself and rang for his 
chauffeur after his telephone 
conversation with Professor 
Sims. 

Meanwhile, Mrs. Stewart 
turned to Sims. 

"Will you please tell us if 
Junius can be milked?" 

"I really don't know yet, 
Mrs. Stewart. I'll have to investigate the area for harmful radio-activity first, then 
I'll have to check the cow, 
herself. Pardon me." He 
turned to the phone again. 

Trying to keep his voice 
and emotion under control, 
Professor Sims called his 
laboratory at the University 
and ordered among other 
technical equipment, a geiger 
counter, a gamma ray detector, a portable lead shield, 



body and temperature thermometers, portable X-ray machine, and a dozen pairs of 
smoked glasses. 

The equipment arrived 
within the hour, and Professor Sims distributed it among 
his assistants with his instructions. It was understood that 
he alone would approach 
Junius wearing his smoked 
glasses and carrying the protective lead shield, to make 
the initial test. If his tests 
proved that Junius could be 
safely approached, he would 
go back for the others. 

"You look like one of them 
flying saucer fellas, yerself," 
Zack laughed, seeing Professor Sims donned in the lead 
shield and the dark glasses. 

Sims waved at the crowd in 
the farmyard and walked awkwardly toward the glow in 
the north wood, less pronounced now in the daylight. 
They watched until his retreating figure disappeared 
into the woods, and they were 
still watching the spot for 
what seemed a long time 
afterward. One of the assistants fidgeted and looked at 
his watch. 

"He's been in there twenty 
minutes. Wonder what he's 
doing?" 

"I hope he's milking her." 
Mrs. Stewart said hopefully. 

Zack chuckled as a thought 
struck him. 

"What's so funny, Zack?" 
His wife asked. 

"Junius," Zack's chuckle 



THE SHINING COW 



99 



bubbled into laughter, "will 
be the first cow to give radiated milk." 

Finally, after another fifteen minutes, they saw Professor Sims emerge from the 
woods. As he came across the 
pasture they could see that 
his smoked glasses were 
propped above his eyebrows 
and he was concentrating on 
a small notebook in his hand, 
shaking his head from time 
to time. 

When he finally joined the 
waiting group, he was flooded 
with questions. 

He gestured them into silence. 

"Please, I cannot answer 
any questions as yet until I 
have consulted with my assistant 1 ;. Sgt. Johnson, will 
you please have your men 
guard the clearing while we 
hold a conference ?" 

"Is it safe to get that c^ose 
to her?'' The trooper asked, 
unbelieving. 

"I can assure you that it is. 
There is just a negligible 
amount of radio-activity present, arid no more ultra violet 
rays then there are in an 
average sun lamp. But you 
must wear your glasses." 
Turning to his aides he said, 
"Come gentlemen," and they 
followed him into the farmhouse. 

"Can she be milked?" Mrs. 
Stewart wailed after them. 

"What a gadavrful situation." Zack muttesred, grab


bing a pitchfork and heading 
for the barn. 

The scientists seated themselves around the big dining 
room table and faced Professor Sims. 

"Gentlemen, it's the most 
amazing thing that ever happened. That cow is glowing 
out there like a miniature 
atomic pile, and under the 
circumstances as we know 
them, should be deader than 
a door nail, but there she 
stands, shining like the morning sun, chewing her cud and 
just mooing away as if nothing happened." 

"What is your theory, Professor?" One of the assistants asked. 

"I have one, but it's utterly fantastic." Sims answered. 

"So is that cow out there. 
Let's hear it !" 

"Do you remember how 
much more frequent saucer 
sightings were reported in 
this area alone?" Sims asked. 
All the assistants nodded 
their heads. 

"Well," Sims went on, "I 
am of the opinion that a saucer actually landed out there 
and they came across the cow 
by accident. They either shot 
her with some sort of radium 
ray gun, or some luminous 
substance unknown to us." 

"Why didn't Junius die?" 
One of the assistants asked. 

Sims shook his head. "They 
wished to examine her. You 
see, gentlemen, whatever it 
was, it served a threefold purpose. It made her luminous, 



100 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



immobile and — " Sims placed 
both hands on the table and 
leaned forv/ard for emphasis, 
"transparent." 

There was a gasp and exclamations. 

"Transparent? how? — " 

"I was within a foot of the 
cow, felt her hide, and 
through the glasses I could 
see the skeletal frame, the 
chest cavity, the heart beating within, the entire intestinal tract, much, much more 
clearly than could be seen by 
the best X-ray." 

As if on command, the assistants all rose simultaneously. 

"Sit down, gentlemen, the 
cow isn't going anywhere. 
We shall have to face this 
situation with sound scientific reasoning. There will be 
a closed van here soon to pick 
up Junius and haul her to the 
laboratory where we can examine her mere thoroughly. 
Now my belief is that the 
saucer took off in haste, such 
great haste that thev forgot 
to extinguish poor JimiusT I 
believe they will be back 
looking for h?r, therefore we 
shall have to return her tonight and conceal ourselves 
around the area and watch." 

"Snlendid ide^i, Professor 
Sims!" One of the assistants 
exclaimed. 

Yelling voices in the farmyard caught their attention. 
They saw S ,t. Johnson 
through the dining rorm window, coming across the yard, 
yelling and pointing to the 



sky. Sims rushed from the 
house, met Johnson, grasped 
him by the shoulders, shaking him. 

"What happened, man, 
what happened?" Sims asked. 

"Black light, black light!" 
Johnson shouted, pointing 
skyward. Sims looked up. 
Nothing but the serene blue 
of the summer sky and an 
occasional bird caught his 
eye. 

Sims shook him again, 
more roughly. 

"Speak, man, what happened?" 

"Black light flashed d own 
on the cow! Blackest light 
you ever saw!" 

The group gathered around 
him in the yard, trying to 
make sense out of what he 
said. So engrossed were they 
with his babblings, that none 
but Mrs. Stewart was aware 
of the fact that Junius had 
entered the farmyard and was 
eyeing them curiously. 

"Junius!" She exclaimed. 

"Moooo!" 

The crowd looked up to see 
the ordinary, unlit * Junius 
standing calmly by the gate. 

"Hurry and get the milk 
pail, Zack, Junius is all right 
now!" Mrs. Stewart yelled 
happily to her husband, as 
Professor Sims and his assistants led the hysterical trooper into the house. 

High over the horizon, a 
faint, silvery disc was disappearing at fantastic speed

KNOW HIM? 

Well you might say I practically grew up with him. He 
was my hero in those days. I 
thought few wiser or greater 
men ever lived. In my eyes he 
was greater than Babe Ruth, 
Lindy, or the President. 

Of course, time, and my 
growing up caused me to 
bring him into a perspective 
that I felt to be more consonant with his true position in 
his field of endeavor. When 
he died his friends mourned 
for fond remembrance of 
things past, but privately 
many of them felt that he had 
outlived his best days. Now 
with this glorious vindication, 
I wonder how many of them 
are still alive to feel the 
twinge of conscience... 

Oh we're delighted - of 
course, but it seems incredible 
even today to us elated oldsters. Although we were always his staunchest admirers, 
in retrospect we can see now 
that no one believed more 
than we that he did it strictly 
for the dollar. It is likely 
there was always a small 
corps of starry-eyed adolescents who found the whole 
improbable saga entirely believable, or at least half be

Heved it might be partly true. 
The attitude of the rest of us 
ranged from a patronizing 
disparagment that we thought 
was expected of us, through 
grudging admiration, to outand-out enthusiasm. 

Certainly if anybody had 
taken the 'trouble to consider 
it— and why should they 
have?— the landing of the 
first manned ship on our 
satellite seemed to render 
him as obsolete as a horde of 
other lesser and even greater 
lights. At any rate it was 
inevitable that the conquest 
of the moon would be merely 
a stepping-stone to more distant points. 

Oh no, I had nothing to do 
with the selection of the Red 
Planet. Coming in as head of 
Project P-4 in it's latter 
stages, as I did when Dr. 
Fredericks died, the selection 
had already been made. Yes, 
it's quite likely I may have 
been plugging for Mars below 
the conscious level. A combination of chance, expediency 
and popular demand made 
Mars the next target, rather 
than Venus, which was, in 
some ways, the more logical 
goal. I would have given anything to have gone, but the 
metaphorical stout heart that 
one reporter once credited me 
with is not the same as an old 
man's actual fatty heart. 

And there were heartbreak 
years ahead before the Goddard was finally ready. During this time he slipped further into obscurity while big, 



UNIVERSE 

important things were happening all around us. You're 
right, that one really big creation of his is bigger than 
ever. It has passed into the 
language, and meant employment for thousands of people. 
Too few of them have even 
heard of him. Of course he 
was still known and welcomed 
by a small circle of acquaintances, but to the world at 
large he was truly a "forgotten man". 

It is worthy of note that 
one of the oldest of -these acquaintances was present at 
biast-off time. He happened 
to be the grandfather of a certain competent young crewman. The old man was a proud 
figure during the brief ceremonies and his eyes filled 
with tears as the mighty 
rocket climbed straight up on 
it's fiery tail. He remained 
there gazing up at the sky 
long after it had vanished. 

He was heard to murmur, 
"I am glad the kid could go, 
but it is just a lark to him. He 
never had a "sense of wonder". How could he— nobody 
reads anymore". 

Afterward, his senile emotions betraying him, he broke 
down completely and had to 
be led from the field. It is rumored he did not live long after that. 

The Goddard drove on until 
Mars filled the viz-screen. It 
was planned to make at least 
a half-dozen braking passes 
around the planet for observational purposes before the 



IT'S A SMALL SOLAR SYSTEM 



103 



actual business of bringing 
the ship in for landfall began. As expected the atmosphere proved to be thin. The 
speculated dead-sea areas, 
oddly enough, turned out to 
be just that. To the surprise 
of some, it was soon evident 
that Mars possessed, or had 
possessed, a high civilization. 
The car.ali of Schiaparelli 
were indeed broad waterways 
stretching from pole to pole, 
too regular to be anything but 
the work of intelligence. But 
most wonderful of all were 
the scattered, but fairly numerous large, walled cities 
that dotted the world. Everybody was excited, eager to 
land and start exercising their 
specialties. 

One of the largest of these 
cities was selected more or 
less at random. It was decided to set down just outside, 
yet far enough from the walls 
to avoid any possibility of 
damage from the landing jets 
in the event the city was inhabited. Even if deserted, the 
entire scientific personnel 
would h?.ve raised a howl that 
would have been heard back 
on Earth if just a section of 
wall was scorched. When 
planet-fall was completed and 
observers had time to scan 
the surroundings it was seen 
that the city was very much 
alive. 

"What keeps them up!" 
marvelled Kopchainski, the 
aeronautics and rocketry authority. 

The sky swarmed with 



ships of strange design. The 
walls were crowded with inhabitants, too far away for detailed observation. Even as 
they looked an enormous gate 
opened and a procession of 
mounted figures emerged. In 
the event the place was deserted the Captain would have 
had the honor of being the 
first to touch Martian soil. 
While atmospheric and other 
checks were being run he 
gave orders for the previously 
decided alternative. Captain, 
semanticist and anthropologist would make the First 
Contact. 

With all checks agreeing 
that it was safe to open locks, 
soon the three representatives of Earth were walking 
shoulder to shoulder dowr. 
the ramp. It was apparent that 
the two scientists purposely, 
missed stride inches from the 
end, so that it was the Captain's foot that actually 
touched ground first. 

The c a v z 1 c a d e — though 
these beasties were certainly 
not horses — was now near 
enough to the ship for details 
to be seen. Surprise and wonderment filled the crew, for 
while the multi-legged steeds 
were as alien as anyone might 
expect to find on an alien 
world, the riders were very 
definitely humanoid. Briefly, 
brightly and barbarically 
trapped as they were by 
earthly standards, they 
seemed to be little distinguishable from homegrown 
homo saps. 



104 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



The approaching company 
appeared to be armed mainly 
with swords and lances, but 
also in evidence were some tubular affairs that could very 
well be some sort of projectile 
discharging device. The Captain suddenly felt unaccountably warm. It was a heavy responsibility — he hoped these 
Martians wouldn't be the 
type of madmen who believed 
in the "shoot first, inquire 
later" theory. 

Even as he stood there, outwardly calm but jittering internally the Martian riders 
pulled up ten feet from the 
Earthmen. Their leader, tall, 



dark haired, and subtly lighter in hue than his companions, 
dismounted and approached 
the Captain. With outstretched hand he took the 
Captain's in a firm grip. 

Let it be recorded here, to 
the shame of an Earth where 
reading for pleasure is virtually a lost pastime, that not 
one man on the Goddard realized the significance of what 
followed. 

"How do you do?" he said 
in perfect English, with an 
unmistakable trace of Southern accent. 

"Welcome to Barsoom! My 
name is John Carter."

and FREDRIC BROWN 



Sometimes Hie queeily shaped 
Veiuisian trees seemed to talk 
to him, but their voices were 
soft. They were loyal people. 



THERE were four men in 
the life boat that came down 
from the space cruiser. Three 
of them were still in the uniform of the Galactic Guards. 

The fourth sat in the prow 
of the small craft looking 
down at their goal, hunched 
and silent, bundled up in a 
greatcoat against the coolness 
of space — a greatcoat which 
he would never need again after this morning. The brim of 
his hat was pulled down far 
over his forehead, and he 
studied the nearing shore 
through dark lensed glasses. 
Bandages, as though for a 
broken jaw, covered most of 
the lower part of his face. 

He realized suddenly that 
the dark glasses, now that 
they had left the cruiser, were 
unnecessary. He slipped them 
off. After the cinematographic grays his eyes bad 
seen through these lenses for 
so long, the brilliance of the 
color below him was almost 
like a blow. He blinked, and 
looked again. 

They were rapidly settling 
toward a shoreline, a beach. 
The sand was a dazzling, unbelievable white such as had 
never been on his home planet. Blue the sky and water, 



A world had collapsed around this man — a world that would never shout 
kin praises again. The burned out cities were still and dead, the twisted 
bodies and twisted souls giving him their last salute in death. And now 
he ;<«s alone, ulone surrounded by memories, alone and wailing . . .

and green the edge of the 
fantastic jungle. There was a 
flash of red in the green, aa 
they came still closer, and he 
realized suddenly that it must 
be a maiigee, the semi-intelligent Venusian parrot once so 
popular as pets throughout 
the solar system. 

Throughout the system 
blood and steel had fallen 
from the sky and ravished the 
planets, but now it fell no 
more. 

And now this. Here in this 
forgotten portion of an almost completely destroyed 
world it had not fallen at ail. 

Only in some place like 
this, alone, was safety for 
him. Elsewhere — anywhere — 
imprisonment or, more likely, 
death. There was danger, even 
here. Three of the crew of the 
space cruiser knew. Perhaps, 
someday, one of them would 
talk. Then they would come 
fcr him, even here. 

But that was a chance he 
could not avoid. Nor were the 
odds bad, for three people 
out of a whole solar system 
knew where he was. And 
those three were loyal fools. 

The life boat came gently to 
rest. The hatch swung open 
and he stepped out and 
walked a few paces up the 
beach. He turned and waited 
while the two spacemen who 
had guided the craft brought 
his chest out and carried it 
across the beach and to the 
corrugated tin shack just at 
the edge of the trees. That 
shack had once been a space


radar relay station. Now the 
equipment it had held was 
long gone, the antenna mast 
taken down. But the shack 
still stood. It would be his 
home for a while. A long 
while. The two men returned 
to the lifeboat preparatory to 
leaving. 

And now the captain stood 
facing him, and the captain's 
face was a rigid mask. It 
seemed with an effort that 
the captain's right arm remained at his side, but that 
effort had been ordered. No 
sahite. 

The captain's voice, too, 
was rigid with unemotion. 
"Number One. 

"Silence !" And then, less 
bitterly. "Come further from 
the boat before you again let 
your tongue run loose. Here." 
They had reached the shack. 

"You are right, Number. . ." 

"No. I am no longer Number One. You must continue 
to think of me as Mister 
Smith, your cousin, whom you 
brought here for the reasons 
you explained to the underofficers. before you surrender 
your ship. If you think of me 
so, you will be less likely to 
slip in your speech." 

"There is nothing further I 
can do — Mister Smith?" 

"Nothing. Go now." 

"And I am ordered to surrender the — " 

"There are no orders. The 
war is over, lost. I would suggest thought as to what spaceport you put into. In some 



HAPPY 

you may receive humane 
treatment. In others — ." 

The captain nodded. "In 
others, there is great hatred. 
Yes. That is all?" 

"That is all. And Captain, 
your running of the blockade, 
your securing of fuel enroute, 
have constituted a deed of 
high valor. All I can give you 
in reward is my thanks. But 
now go. Goodbye." 

"Not goodbye," the captain 
blurted impulsively, "but hasta la vista, auf W iedersehen, 
until the day. . .you will permit me, or the last time to address you and salute?" 

The man in the greatcoat 
shrugged. "As you will." 

Click of heels and a salute 
that once greeted the Ceasars, 
and later the pseudo-aryan of 
the 20th Century, and, but 
yesterday, he who was now 
known as the last of the dictators. "Farewell, Number 
One!" 

"F a r e w e 1 1," he answered 
emotionlessly. 

Mr. Smith, a blacked dot 
on the dazzling white sand, 
watched the lifeboat disappear up into the blue, finally 
into the haze of the upper atmosphere of Venus. That 
eternal haze that would always be there to mock his 
failure and his bitter solitude. 

The slow days snarled by, 
and the sun shone dimly, and 
the marigees screamed in the 
early dawn and all day and at 
sunset, and sometimes there

were the six legged baroons, 
monkey-like in the trees, that 
g i b b e r e d at him. And the 
rams came and went away 
again. 

At nights there were drums 
in the distance. Not the martial roll of marching, nor yet 
a threatening note of savage 
hate. Just drums, many miles 
away, throbbing rhythm for 
native dances or exorcizinc 
perhaps, the forest-night demons. He assumed these Venusians had their superstitions, 
all other races had. There was 
no threat, for him, in that 
tnrobbing that was like the 
beating of the jungle's heart. 

Mr. Smith knew that, for 
although his choice of destinations had been a hasty 
choice, yet there had been 
time for him to read the 
available reports. The natives 
were harmless and friendly. A 
Terran missionary had lived 
among them some time ago— 
before the outbreak of the 
war. They were a simple 
weak race. They seldom went 
far from their villages; the 
space-radar operator who had 
once occupied the shack reported that he had never s^n 
one of them. 

So there would be no difficulty in avoiding the natives 
nor danger if he did encounter them. 

Nothing to worry about, except the bitterness. 

Not the bitterness of regret, but of defeat. Defeat at 
the hands of the defeated. 
The damned Martians who 



108 FANTASTIC 

came back after he had driven 
them halfway across their 
damned arid planet. The Jupiter Satellite Confederation 
landing endlessly on the home 
planet, sending their vast armadas of spacecraft daily and 
nightly to turn his mighty cities into dust. In spite of everything; in spite of his score 
of ultra vicious secret weapons and the last desperate 
efforts of his weakened armies most of whose men were 
under twenty or over forty. _ 

The treachery even in his 
own army, among his own 
generals and admirals. The 
turn of Luna, that had been 
the end. 

His people would rise 
again. But not, now after Armageddon, in his lifetime. 
Not under him, nor another 
like him. The last of the dictators. 

Hated by a solar system, 
and hating it. 

It would have been intolerable, save that he was alone. 
• He had foreseen that — the 
need for solitude. Alone, he 
was still Number One. The 
presence of others would have 
forced recognition of his miserably changed status. Alone, 
his pride was undamaged. His 
ego was intact. 

The long days, and the 
marigees' screams, the slithering swish of the surf, the 
ghost-quiet movements of the 
barodns in the trees and the 
raucousness of their shrill 
voices. Drums. 



UNIVERSE 

Those sounds, and those 
alone. But perhaps silence 
would have been worse. 

For the times of silence 
were louder. Times, he would 
pace the beach at night and 
overhead would be the roar of 
jets and rockets, the ships 
that had roared over New Albuquerque, his capitol, in 
those last days before he had 
fled. The crump of bombs and 
the screams and the blood, 
and the flat voices of his folding generals. 

Those were the days when 
the waves of hatred from the 
conquered peoples beat upon 
his country as the waves of a 
stormy sea beat upon crumbling cliffs. Leagues back of 
the battered lines, you could 
feel that hate and vengeance 
as a tangible thing, a thing 
that thickened the air, that 
made breathing difficult and 
talking futile. 

And the spacecraft, the jets., 
the rockets, the damnable 
rockets, more every day and 
every night, and ten coming 
for every one shot down. 
Rocket ships raining hell 
from the sky, havoc and chaos and the end of hope. 

And then he knew that he 
had been hearing another 
sound, hearing it often and 
long at a time. It was a voice 
that shouted invective and 
ranted hatred and glorified 
the steel might of his planet 
and the destiny of a man and 
a people. 

It was his own voice, and it 
beat back the waves from the 



HAPPY 

white shore, it stopped their 
v/et encroachment upon this, 
his domain. It screamed back 
at the haroons and they were 
silent. And at times he 
laughed, and the marigces 
laughed. Sometimes, the 
queerly shaped Venusian 
trees talked too, but their 
voices were quieter. The 
trees were submissive, they 
were good subjects. 

Sometimes, fantastic 
thoughts went through his 
head. The race of trees, the 
pure race of trees that never 
interbred, that stood firm always. Someday the trees — 

But that was just a dream, 
a fancy. More real were the 
marigess and the kits. They 
were the ones who persecuted 
him. There was the mar i gee 
who v/ould shriek "All is 
lost!" He had shot at it a 
hundred times with his needle gun, but always it flew 
away unharmed. Sometimes 
it did not even fly away. 

"All is lost'" 

At last he wanted no more 
needle darts. K: stacked it to 
strangle it with his bare 
hands. That wa-3 better. On 
what might have been the 
thousandth try, he caught it 
and killed it, and there was 
warm blood on his hands and 
feathers were flying. 

That should have ended it, 
but it didn't. Now there were 
a dozen marigees that 
screamed that all v/as lost. 
Perhaps there had been a dozen all along. Now he merely 



ENDING 109 

shook his fist at them' or 
threw stones. 

The kifs, the Venusian 
equivalent of the Terran ant, 
stole his food. Eut that did 
not matter; there v/as plenty 
of food. There had been a 
cache of it in the shack, 
meant to restock a spacecruiser, and never used. The 
kifs would not get at it until 
he opened a can, but then, unless he ate it all at once, they 
ate whatever he left. That did 
not matter. There were plenty of cans. And always fresh 
fruit from the jungle. Always in season, for there 
were no seasons here, except 
the rains. 

But the kits served a purpose for him. Thev kept him 
sane, by giving him something tangible, something inferior, to hate. 

Oh, it wasn't hatred, at 
first. Mere annoyance. He 
killed them in a routine sort 
of way at first. But they kept 
coming back. Always there 
were kifs. In his larder, 
wherever he did it. In his 
bed. He sat the legs of the 
cot in dishes of gasoline, but 
the k'fs still got in. Perhaps 
they dropped from the ceiling, although he never caught 
them doing it. 

They bothered his sleep. 
He'd feel them running over 
him, even when he'd spent an 
hour picking the bed clean of 
them by the light of the carbide lantern. They scurried 
with tickling little feet and 
he could not sleep. 



HO FANTASTIC 

He grew to hate them, and 
the very misery of his nights 
made his days more tolerable 
by giving them an Increasing 
purpose. A pogrom against 
the kifs. He sought out their 
holes by patiently following 
one bearing a bit of food, and 
he poured gasoline into the 
hole and the earth around it, 
taking satisfaction in the 
thought of the wri things in 
agony below. He went about 
hunting kifs, to step on them. 
To stamp them out. He must 
have killed millions of kifs. 

But always there were as 
many left. Never did their 
number seem to diminish in 
the slightest. Like the Martians — but unlike the Martians, they did not fight back. 

Theirs was the pisr.ive resistance of a vast productivity that bred kit's ceaselessly, 
overwhelmingly, billions to 
replace millions. Individual 
kifs could be killed, and he 
took savage satisfaction in 
their killing, but he knew his 
methods were useless save for 
the pleasure and the purpose 
they gave him. Somebmes the 
pleasure would pall in the 
shadow of its futility, and he 
would dream of mechanized 
means of killing them. 

He read carefully what litKe material there was in his 
tiny library about the kit. 
They were astonishingly like 
the ants of Terra. So much 
that there had been speculation about their relationship 
— that didn't interest him. 
How could they be killed, en 



UNIVERSE 

masse? Once a year, for a 
brief period, they took on the 
characteristics of the army 
ants of Terra. They came 
from their holes in endless 
numbers and swept everything before them in their devouring march. He wet his 
lips when he read that. Perhaps the opportunity would 
come then to destroy, to destroy, and destroy. 

Almost, Mr. Smith forgot 
people and the solar system 
and what had been. Here in 
this new world, there was 
only he and the kifs. The 
baroons and the marigees 
didn't fount. They had no 
order and no system. The 
kifs— 

In the intensity of his hatred there slowly filtered 
through a grudging admiration. The kifs were true totalitarins. They practiced what 
he had preached to a mightier race, practiced it with a 
thoroughness beyond the kind 
of roan to comprehend. 

Theirs the complete submergence or the individual to 
the state, theirs the complete 
ruthlessness of the true con- ■ 
queror, the perfect selfless 
bravery of the true soldier. 

But they got into his bed, 
into his clothes, into his food. 

They crawled with intolerable tickling feet. 

Nights he walked the 
beach, and that night was one 
of the noisy nights. There 
• were high-flying, high-whining jet-craft up there in the 
moonlight sky and their 



HAPPY ENDING 



shadows dappled the black 
water of the sea. The planes, 
the rockets, the jet-craft, they 
were what had ravaged his 
cities, had turned his railroads into twisted steel, had 
dropped their H-Bombs on 
his most vital factories. 

He shook his fist at them 
and shrieked imprecations at 
the sky. 

And when he had ceased 
shouting, there were voices 
on the beach. Conrad's voice 
in his ear, as it had sounded 
that day when Conrad had 
walked into the palace, whitefaced, and forgotten the salute. "There is a breakthrough at Denver, Number 
One! Toronto and Monterey 
are in danger. And in the other hemispheres — *' His voice 
cracked. " — the damned Martians and the traitors from 
Luna are driving over the 
Argentine. Others have landed near New Petrograd. It is 
a rout. All is lost !" 

Voices crying, "Number 
One, hail! Number One, 
hail!" 

A sea of hysterical voices. 
"Number One, hail! Number 
One— " 

A voice that was louder, 
higher, more frenetic than 
any of the others. His memory of his own voice, calculated but inspired, as he'd heard 
it on play-backs of his own 
speeches. 

The voices of children 
chanting, "To thee, O Number One — " He couldn't remember the rest of the words, 



but they had been beautiful 
words. That had been at the 
public school meet in the 
New Los Angeles. How 
strange that he should remember, here and now, the 
very tone of his voice and inflection, the shining wonder 
in their children's eyes. 
Children only, but they were 
willing to kill and die, for 
him, convinced that all that 
was needed to cure the ills of 
the race was a suitable leader to follow. 
"All is lost!" 

And suddenly the monster 
jet-craft were swooping 
downward and starkly he realized what a clear target he 
presented, here against the 
white moonlit beach. They 
must see him. 

The crescendo of motors as 
he ran, sobbing now in fear, 
for the cover of the jungle. 
Into the screening shadow of 
the giant trees, and the sheltering blackness. 

He stumbled and fell, was 
up and running again. And 
now his eyes could see in the 
dimmer moonlight that filtered through the branches 
overhead. Stirrings there, in 
the branches. Stirrings and 
voices in the night. Voices in 
and of the night. Whispers 
and shrieks of pain. Yes, he'd 
shov/n them pain, and now 
their tortured voices ran with 
him through the knee-deep 
night-wet grass among the 
trees. 

The night was hideous with 
noise. Red noises, an almost 



112 FANTASTIC 

tangible din that he could 
nearly feel as well as he 
could see and hear it. And after a while his breath came 
ranrjingly. and there was a 
thumping; sound that was the 
beating of his heart and the 
beating of the night. 

And then, he could run no 
longer, and he clutched a tree 
to keep from falling, his arms 
trembling about it, and his 
face pressed against the impersonal roughness of the 
bark. There was no wind, but 
tiie tree swayed back and 
forth and his body with it. 

Then, as abruptly as light 
goes on when a switch is 
thrown, the noise vanished. 
Utter silence, and at last he 
was strong enough to let go 
his grip on the tree and 
stand' erect again, to look 
ab'.ut to get his bearings. 

One tree was like another, 
and for a moment he thought 
he'd have to stay here until 
daylight. Then he remembered that the sound of the 
surf would give him his directions. He listened hard 
and heard it, faint and far 
3 way. 

And another sound — one 
that he had never heard before — faint, also, but seerr-ing 
to come from his right and 
quite near. 

He looked that way, and 
there was a patch of opening 
in the trees above. The grass 
was waving stran.gly in that 
area of' moonlight. It moved, 
although there was no breeze 
to move it. And there was an 



UNIVERSE 

almost sudden edge, beyond 
which the blades thinned out 
quickly to barrenness. 

And the sound — it wss like 
the sound of the surf, but it 
was continuous. It was more 
like the rustle of dry leaves, 
but there were no dry leaves 
to rustle. 

Mr. Smith took a step toward the sound and looked 
down. More grass bent, and 
fell, and vanished, even as he 
looked. Beyond the moving 
edge of devastation was a 
brown floor of the moving 
bodies of kits. 

Row after row, orderly 
rank after orderly rank, 
marching resistlessly onward. 
Eiilions of kits, an army of 
kiis, eating their way across 
the night. 

Fascinated, he stared down 
at them. There was no danger, 
for their progress was slow. 
He retreated a step to keep 
beyond their front rank. The 
sound, then, was the sound of 
chewing. 

He could see one edge of 
the column, and it was a neat, 
orderly edge. And there was 
discipline, for the ones on 
the outside were larger than 
those in the center. 

He retreated another step 
— and then, quite suddenly, 
his body was afire in several 
spreading places. The vanguard. Ahead of the rank that 
ate away the grass. 

His boots were brown with 
Mis. 

Screaming with pairi, he 
whirled about and ran, beat


HAPPY ENDING 



ing with his hands at the 
burning spots on his body. He 
ran head-on into a tree, bruising his face horribly, and the 
night was scarlet with pain 
and shooting fire. 

But he staggered on, almost 
blindly, running, writhing, 
tearing off his clothes as he 
ran. 

This, then, was pain. There 
was a shrill screaming in his 
ears that must have been the 
sound of his own voice. 

When he could no longer 
run, he crawled. Naked, now, 
and with only a few kifs still 
clinging to him. And the 
blind tangent of his flight 
had taken him well out of the 
path of the advancing army. 

But stark fear and the 
memory of unendurable pain 
drove him on. His knees raw 
now, he could no longer 
crawl. But he got himself 
erect again on trembling legs, 
and staggered on. Catching 
hold of a tree and pushing 
himself away from it to catch 
the next. 

Falling, rising, falling 
again. His throat raw from 
the screaming invective of 
his hate. Bushes and the 
rough bark of trees tore his 
flesh. 

Into the village compound 
just before dawn, staggered a 
man, a naked terrestrial. He 
looked about with dull eyes 
that seemed to see nothing 
and understand nothing. 

The females and young 
ran before him, even the 
males retreated. 



He stood there, swaying, 
and the incredulous eyes of 
the natives widened as they 
saw the condition of his body, 
and the b!ankness of his eyes. 

When he made no hostile 
move, they came closer again, 
formed a wondering, chattering circle about him, these 
Venusian humanoids. Some 
ran to bring the chief and 
the chief's son, who knew 
everything. 

The mad, naked human 
opened his Hps as though he 
were going to speak, but instead, he fell. He fell, as a 
dead man falls. But when 
they turned him over in the 
dust, they saw that his chest 
still rose and fell in labored 
breathing. 

And then came Aiwa, the 
aged chieftan, and Nrana, bis 
son. Aiwa gave quick, excited orders. Two of the men 
carried Mr. Smith into the 
chief's hut, and the wives of 
the chief and the chief's son 
took over the Earthling's 
care, and rubbed him with a 
soothing and healing salve. 

But for days and nights he 
lay without moving and without speaking or opening his 
eyes, and they did not know 
whether he would live or die. 

Then, at last, he opened 
his eyes. And he talked, although they could make out 
nothing of the things he said. 

Nrana came and listened, 
for Nrana of all of them spoke 
and understood best the 
Earthling's language, for he 



114 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



had been the special protege 
of the Terran missionary who 
had lived with them for a 
while. 

Nrana listened, but he 
shook his head. "The words," 
he said, "the words are of the 
Terran tongue, but I make 
nothing of them. His mind is 
not well." 

The aged Aiwa said, "Aie. 
Stay beside him. Perhaps as 
his body heals, his words will 
be beautiful words as were 
the words of the Father-ofUs who, in the Terran tongue, 
taught us of the gods and 
their good." 

So they cared for him well, 
and his wounds healed, and 
the day came when he opened 
his eyes and saw the handsome blue-complexioned face 
of Nrana sitting there beside 
him, and Nrana said softly. 
"Good day, Mr. Man of 
Earth. You feel better, no?" 

There was no answer, and 
the deep-sunken eyes of the 
man on the sleeping mat 
stared, glared at him. Nrana 
could see that those eyes 
were not yet sane, but he 
saw, too, that the madness in 
them was not the same that 
it had been. Nrana did not 
know the words for delirium 
and paranoia, but he could 
distinguish between them. 

No longer was the Earthling a raving maniac, and 
Nrana made a very common 
error, an error more civilized 
beings than he have often 
made. He thought the paranoia was an improvement 



over the wider madness. He 
talked on, hoping the Earthling would talk too, and he 
did not recognize the danger 
of his silence. 

"We welcome you, Earthling," he said, "and hope that 
you will live among us, as did 
the Father-of-Us, Mr. Gerhardt. He taught us to worship the true gods of the 
high heavens. Jehovah, and 
Jesus and their prophets the 
men from the skies. He taught 
us to pray and to love our enemies." 

And Nrana shook his head 
sadly, "But many of our 
tribe have gone back to the 
older gods, the cruel gods. 
They say there has been 
great strife among the outsiders, and no more remain 
upon all of Venus. My father, 
Aiwa, and I are glad another 
one has come. You will be 
able to help those of us who 
have gone back. You can 
teach us love and kindliness." 

The eyes of the dictator 
closed. Nrana did not know 
whether or not he slept, but 
Nrana stood up quietly to 
leave the hut. In the doorway, he turned and said, "We 
pray for you." 

And then, joyously, he ran 
out of the village to seek the 
others, who were gathering 
bela-berries for the feast of 
the fourth event. 

When, with several of 
them, he returned to the village, the Earthling was gone. 
The hut was empty. 

Outside the compound they 



HAPPY ENDING 



115 



found, at last, the trail of his 
passing. They followed and 
it led to a stream and along 
the stream until they came to 
the tabu of the green pool, 
and could go no farther. 

"He went downstream," 
said Aiwa gravely. "He 
sought the sea and the beach. 
He was well then, in his 
mind, for he knew that all 
streams go to the sea." 

"Perhaps he had a ship-ofthe-sky there at the beach," 
Nrana said worriedly. "All 
Earthiia gs come from the 
sky. The Father-of-Us told 
us that." 

"Perhaps he will come back 
to us," said Aiwa. His old 
eyes misted. 

Mr. Snrth was coming 
back fcH right, and sooner 
than they had dared to hope. 
As soon in fact, as he could 
make the trip to the shack 
and return. He came back 
dressed in clothing very different from the garb the other white man had worn. 
Shining leather boots and the 
uniforr. of the Galactic 
Guard, and a wide leather belt 
with a holster for his needle 
gun. 

But the gun was in his 
hand when, at dusk, he strode 
into the compound. 

He said, "I am Number 
One, the Lord of all the Solar System, and your ruler. 
Who was chief among you?" 

Aiwa had been in his hut, 
but he heard the words and 
came out. He understood the 



words, but not their meaning. 
He said, "Earthling, we welcome you back. I am the 
chief." 

"You were the chief. Now 
you will serve me. I am the 
chief." 

Alwa's old eyes were bewildered at the strangeness 
of this. He said. "I will serve 
you, yes. All of us. But it is 
not fitting that an Earthling 
should be chief among — " 

The whisper of the needle 
gun. Alwa's wrinkled hands 
went to his scrawny neck 
where, just off the center, 
was a sudden tiny pin prick 
of a hole. A faint trickle of 
red coursed over the dark 
blue of his skin. The old 
man's knees gave way under 
him as the rage of the poisoned needle dart struck him, 
and he fell. Others started 
toward him. 

"Back," said Mr. Smith. 
"Let him die slowly that you 
may all see what happens 
to—" 

But one of the chief's 
wives, one who did not understand the speech of Earth, 
was already lifting Alwa's 
head. The needle gun whispered again, and she fell forward across him. 

"I am Number One," said 
Mr. Smith, "and Lord of all 
the planets. All who oppose 
me, die by — " 

And then, suddenly all oi 
them were running toward 
him. His finger pressed the 
trigger and four e-f them 
died before the avalanche of 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



their bodies bore him down 
and overwhelmed hirn. Nrana 
had been first in that rush, 
and Nrana died. 

The others tied the Earthling- up and threw him into 
one of the huts. And then, 
while the women began wailing for the dead, the men 
made council. 

They elected K a 1 1 a n a 
chief and he stood before 
them and said, '"The Fatherof-Us, the Mister Gerhardt, 
deceived us." There was fear 
and worry in his voice and 
apprehension on his blue 
face. "If this be indeed the 
Lord of whom he told us — " 

"He is not a god," said another. "He is an Earthling, 
but there have been such before on Venus, many many of 
them who came long and 
long ago from the sines. Now 
they are all dead, killed in 
strife among themselves. It 
is well. This last one is one 
of them, but he is mad." 

And they talked long and 
the dunk grew into night 
while they talked of what 
they must do. The gleam of 
firelight upon their bodies, 
and the waiting drummer. 

The problem was difficult. 
To harm one who was mad 
we.3 tabu. If he was really a 
god, it would be worse. 
Thunder and lightning from 
the sky would destroy the 
village. Yet they dared not 
release him. Even if they 
took the evil weapon-thatwhispered-its-death and buried it, he might find other 



ways to harm them. He might 
have another where he had 
gone for the first. 

Yes, it was a difficult problem for them, but the eldest 
and wisest of them, one 
M'Ganne, gave them at last 
the answer. 

"O Kallana," he said, "Let 
us give him to the kits. If 
rAey harm him — " and old 
M'Ganne grinned a toothless, 
mirthless grin " — it would 
be their doing and not ours." 

Kallana shuddered. "It is 
the most horrible of all 
deaths. And if he is a god — " 

"If he is a god, they will 
not harm him. If he is mad 
and not a god, we will not 
have harmed him. It harms 
not a man to tie him to a 
tree." 

Kallana considered, well, 
for the safely of his people 
was at stake. Considering, he 
remembered how Aiwa and 
Nrana had died. 

He said, 'It is right." 

The waiting drummer began the rhythm of the council-end, and those of the men 
who were young and feet 
lighted torches in the fire 
and went out into the forest 
to seek the kifs, who were 
still in their season of marching. 

And after a while, having 
found what they sought, they 
returned. 

They took the Earthling 
out with them, then, and tied 
him to a tree. They left him 
there, and tr.ey left the gag 
over his lips because they did 



HAPPY ENDING 



117 



not wish to hear his screams 
when the kifs came. 

The cloth of the gag would 
be eaten, too, but by that 
time, there would be no flesh 
under it from which a scream 
might come. 

They left him, and went 
back to the compound, and 
the drums took up the rhythm 
of propitiation to the gods 
for what they had done. For 
they had, they knew, cut 
very close to the corner of a 
tabu — but the provocation had 
been great and they hoped 
they would not be punished. 

All night the drums would 
throb. 

The man tied to the tree 
struggled with his bonds, but 
they were strong and hiswrithings made the knots 
but tighten. 

His eyes became accustomed to the darkness. 

He tried to shout, 'T am 
Number One, Lord of — " 

And then, because he could 
not shout and because he 
could not loosen himself, 
there came a rift in his madness. He remembered who he 
was, and all the old hatreds 
and bitterness welled up in 
him. 

He remembered, too, what 
had happened in the com


pound, and wondered whj' the 
Venusian natives had not 
killed him. Why, instead, 
they had tied him here alone 
in the darkness of the jungle. 

Afar, he heard the throbbing of the drums, and they 
were like the beating of the 
heart of night, and there was 
a louder, nearer sound that 
was the pulse of blood in his 
ears as the fear came to him. 

The fear that he knew why 
they had tied him here. The 
horrible, gibbering fear that, 
for the last time, an army 
marched against him. 

He had time to savour that 
fear to the uttermost, to have 
it become a creeping certainty 
that crawled into the black 
corners of his soul as would 
the soldiers of the coming 
army crawl into his ears and 
nostrils while others would 
eat away his eyelids to get at 
the eyes behind them. 

And then, and only then, 
did he hear the sound that 
was like the rustle of dry 
leaves, in a dank, black jungle 
where there were no dry 
leaves to rustle nor breeze to 
rustle them. 

Horribly, Number One, the 
last of the dictators, did not 
go mad again; not exactly, 
but he laughed, and laughed 
and laughed

Then Lis hand caught an arm 
and he exerted his full 
strength. The entire arm tore 
away from its shoulder . . . 



HIS FINGERS moved over 
the modest packet of bills the 
invisible rockhound had handed to him. He smiled through 
the eternal night that was his 
own personal hell. Duggan's 
Hades. 

"Thanks, Pete," he said 
gratefully. "Here, have a box 
of Conmos." 

His sensitized fingers 
found the cigars, handed over 
a box, and he heard the nervous scuff of the other's 
shoes. 

"This eight thousand means 
I can see again — for a while 
•at least. Take 'em! It's little 
enough." 

"Look, Duggan. I get eight 
hundred for selling you the 
ticket on the breakthrough 
time. Keep the cigars. You 
need the dough." 

Feet pounded, thumping 
into swift inaudibility along 
the 10th Level's yielding 
walkway. His fingers caressed 
the crisp notes that his lucky 
guess on the 80th Level's tunnel juncture had won for him, 
plus the ten dollars, that this 
meager business could ill afford, it had cost to join the 
rockhounds' pool. . . 

But now he was free. His

own man. He was released 
from the calculated economies of his wife. Janith knew 
to within a few dollars what 
his newsstand on the 10th 
Level should make. He had 
never been able to save the 
necessary thousand dollar deposit, and ten dollars an hour, 
that a rented super mech 
cost. And she would never 
listen to his pleas that he 
must see again — if only for an 
hour. . . 

"Waste ten or twenty dollars for nothing," she would 
storm. "We have all your hospital bills to pay. I need new 
clothes. Your stock in the 
stands is too small." 

What she left unspoken 
was the fact that she must 
secretly have bated his engineering career in the deep 
levels under Appalachia, and 
that she was dedicated to preventing his possible return. . . 

After three years of blindness, under his wife's firm 
dominance, Duggan felt only 
hate for ber. With this sudden fortune he could be independent. He could divorce 
her. He could rent a super 
mech — even return to work in 
the ever-deepening levels of 
Appalachia City! 

First cf all he must see 
again. 

He closed up the news-and 
cigar stand. With his cane's 
sensitive radar button pulsating beneath his fingers he 
hurried along the walkway toward the nearest super mech 



showroom. It was less than 
three blocks. . . 

"Be sure that all the contacts are against the skull 
and neck," the salesman 
was saying, his voice muffled 
by the mentrol hood covering 
Duggan's head and shoulders. 

"Of course." Duggan's impatience made his voice 
shrill. "I've used mentrols before when inspecting caveins 
and such." 

"Very well, sir." The man's 
voice was relieved. Probably 
he hated his job as much as 
Duggan hated his cigars and 
news. 

Duggan tripped the switches and heard the building 
hum of power. An odd sort 
of vibration that his mind 
told him was purely emotional, seemed to be permeating 
his whole body. 

Abruptly the transition 
was complete. He was no 
longer lying on the padded 
bench beneath the mentrol 
hood. He was standing erect, 
conscious of the retaining 
clamps that held him upright. 

He gulped a deep draught 
of air into the artifical lungs 
that did not need oxygen and 
his mechanical pulse quickened. 

His eyes s 1 i 1 1 e d open, 
drinking in by decrees the 
mirrored mentrol booth and 
the pallid, fat, little man 
sitting beside his hooded 
body. He stepped out of the 
clamps, his sharpened senses 
aware of softness, and hard


120 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



ness, and scent, and color that 
human weakness so often 
blurs. 

This super mech that was 
linked directly with his brain 
by twin mentrols was tall, 
chunky and gray of eye and 
hair. In a general way it was 
a duplicate of his own body, 
but there was no facial resemblance. 

"How do you like it, sir?" 
The fat smile was empty, almost apologetic. "We have 
younger, more handsome 
models. . ." 

"Well enough." Duggan 
started donning the clothing 
that he had removed. "I'll 
v/ant the mech for five, possibly ten, hours." 

"I'll make out the slip for 
ten hours, sir. We'll refund 
any balance due you. But after t.^n hours ..." 

"I know. You miiat report 
the mech missing. But with 
my body here you can"t lose." 

The salesman smiled enigmatically. "We have" he said. 

Duggan shrugged. He was 
impatient to be outside, 
feasting his starved vision on 
the stores and parks of the 
various upper levels. He 
might even take a lift to the 
Outside. It had been fifteen 
years ago, while their youngest son was a baby, that they 
had taken a weekend motor 
trip to the great scar that had 
been Manhattan. He remembered the vastness and the 
rawness of the uncontrolled 
atmosphere. It had been beautiful but also a bit terrifying. 



It was a ten years delayed 
honeymoon . . . 

And now Merle was in the 
rocket corps and Janith and 
he were like strangers. 

Duggan zippered shut his 
gray-checked jacket and left 
the booth. He walked slowly, 
savoring every picture of the 
crowded passenger strips beyond the walkway, and of the 
fairy spans of moving walkways crossing the travel 
strips. The r.oft glow of the 
Level's ceiling, fifty feet 
above, illuminated the double 
rows of apartment and store 
fronts. 

It was good to see again. 

Every twelfth section of 
the Level was a park. The 
greenery was fresher and 
brighter than he remembered; 
the tree boles and the branches were marvels of grace and 
strength. He strolled along 
the paths, impatient to be 
moving on, but aching with 
the emerald beauty around 
him. . . 

He took the lifts to the upper levels. He rode the swiftest walkways and travel 
strips, his eyes drinking in 
the long-hidden sights. From 
an observation dome he 
looked out over the wooded 
mountain slopes of Outside, 
and saw the telltale ridging 
of rock and earth that 
marked the scores of hidden 
vehicular tubes linking Appalachia with its sister cities 
of Ondack and Smoky. 

His five hours stretched 
into seven, and then, eight. 



SECOND SIGHT 



121 



Slowly a determination to 
keep these eyes, at whatever 
cost, was building within him. 
Always before he had agreed 
when Janith decided. He had 
been so dependent on her 
those first terrible weeks. But 
now, with thrs money from 
the breakthrough pool, he 
could rent a super mech — live 
as a man should live ! 

Duggan left the employment booth on the 20th Level, 
a badge on his jacket and a 
half-grin on his full super 
mech's lips. 

On the records he was now 
Al Duggan, a second cousin 
from Montana. He knew that 
nothing in the world could 
bring Al further east than 
Ozarka. Just to be safe, however, he decided to drop Al 
a line to explain. 

As far as his wife was concerned Merle Duggan was 
gone. Dead and buried. She 
could get a divorce if she 
wanted and marry that poddy, 
pink-skulled boss of hers at 
the advertising agency. . . 

''Five hundred a month," 
Duggan told himself. "Twofifty for the rental, fifty for 
insurance — maybe fifty or so 
for spare parts — that leaves 
about a hunded and fifty for 
me." 

He was starting at the bottom as a rock hog, a mucker, 
a clean-up man in the newly 
opened 80th Level. And his 
wages were the minimum 
union scale. 

He took the lift down to 



the 79th Level, flashed his 
new badge at the guards, and 
took the gritty freight lift to 
the lowest level of the sprawling metropolis. . . 

"You Gaines Short?" he 
asked the lanky man bent 
over the littered desk in the 
rough plastic babble that 
served as an office. 

Sharp black eyes studied 
him — noted the bright new 
olive badge, and the creased, 
obviously new, coveralls. 

"You're the new rock hog?" 

"Yes sir. Al Duggan." 

"Any experience?" 

"Montana — m i n i n g. Had 
some engineering. Worked in 
Ozarka on tunnels." 

The lank man nodded, expressionless. 

"You'll hog for a while. 
Later we'll see... Any relation to the Duggan we lost 
a couple of years back?" 

"We're cousins." 

"Toush he couldn't see his 
way clear to try again." 
Short's lips thinned. "He maysnap out of it yet... We 
could use a few more like 
him." 

"I— I'll talk with him," 
promised Duggan. 

He fought back the words 
that wanted to pour out. 
Whether it was a strange 
sense of loyalty to his wife, 
or a stubborn sort of pride, 
he could not bring himself to 
speak ill of her. 

"A super mech is not so 
bad, Duggan." Short flexed a 
sMrs:sy arm, "I've worn this 



122 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



one since a rock slide crushed 
my back." 

"Yes sir," Duggan agreed. 

Short scribbled on a form, 
handed it to Duggan. 

"Take this down to Ted 
Rusche, he's the short, dark 
fellow bossing the rock hogs. 
He'll see you're issued your 
tools." 

Duggan nodded and turned 
away. 

In the Super Mech hostel, on the 79th Level, 
Duggan shared a compartment of six sleeping and 
mentrol plates. All of the 
others were rockhounds, and 
three of them worked in his 
own cleanup gang. His immediate pusher, Ted Rusche, 
was a legless, dark and hairy 
man, much like his working 
super mech. Waide and Myham, the first tall and oncebandsome, and the latter, 
bony and scarred, were both 
paralytics. 

Duggan's share of the attendants' salary amounted to 
another fifty dollars monthly. He was not growing too 
wealthy ! 

"And how do you like it 
after three weeks, Al?" 
Rusche demanded from where 
he balanced on the cushioned 
sleeping plate. 

Duggan stretched cramped 
limbs and turned his sightless face toward Rusche's 
voice. 

"Seems -good to be working 
again, Ted," he said. 



"This's your last day with 
us, Al. Orders from Short. 
He's transferring you. Office 
work I guess, or maybe he's 
making you a foreman." 

Rusche's voice was curious. 

"He musta found out something about you, Al. S'funny 
but you look awful familiar 
to me too. And you know 
more about tunnels than you 
let on. How about leveling 
with a guy?" 

"Not now." Duggan was 
thinking of the other listening men. "A Iter we've 
cleaned-up and eaten. See 
you in the park outside the 
hostek" 

"Right." 

Duggan's thoughts were 
muddled. Fingerprints probably; at every super mech 
hostel all guests were printed 
and taped, and possibly 
through his similar name. 
Short must have been suspicious from the first. And if 
he had come to the hostel to 
see Duggan's mcntrol-hocdc-d 
face, while Duggan worked, 
his identification must have 
been sure. 

Short knew that he was 
Merle Duggan, and before 
too long Janith, and all his 
friends — if he had any left 
now — would know he had 
been in hiding here. 

He hurried to eat and get 
ready for another period under the raentrol's hooded 
probes. 

Less than half an hour later he strode out of the hostel, his super mech gleaming 



SECOND SIGHT

and clean and his jacket and 
shorts newly pressed. He met 
Rusche in the park and they 
headed for the lift to the upper level. 

Enron te to the 10th Level 
he explained. 

"I thought you looked like 
somebody I should know." 
Rusche scrubbed at his 
p s e 11 d o beard's coarseness. 
"Accident left you sort of 
psychoed, huh? So you was 
scared of the Levels? Had to 
try coming back with a false 
name?" 

Duggan gulped. It made a 
believable sort of yarn. He 
hadn't taken time to concoct 
a story. . . Why not? 

"Something like that. I 
guess I was badly shook, 
Ted." 

"So now you go back to being engineer at a thousand or 
so, and I'm still a rock hog." 
Rusche shrugged. "Less 
headaches anyhow." 

They stepped off the lift 
at the 10th Level and took 
the high speed strip toward 
the business section. Durrgan 
had it in his mind to see Janith and tell her she had failed 
— that he was his own man 
again. She would be at the office. He would tell her off, 
and leave. And then he'd 
show Rusche some of the 
high spots of the low number 
levels of Appalachia. 

The darkness came about 
them swiftly. To Duggan it 
was like a return to the 
nightmare of sightlessness. 
Under their feet the racing 



strip faltered ami stalled. 
They were thrown off their 
feet and sprawled on the fiber-ribbed squares of the 
checkerboarded way's surface. 

"What is it?" demanded 
Rusche. 

He fought back the panic. 
This was not true blindness. 

"Criminals. They set off a 
few dozen 'midnight' bombs 
and try to rob banks or stores. 
We get these attacks quite often." 

"Last long?" 

"Emergency ventilation will clear it out in a 
couple of minutes. And the 
Squads will have them in 
half an hour. They never get 
very far." 

They sat close together, to 
wait. From the walkways and 
stalled strips shrieks and 
frightened cries sounded. The 
sounds seemed to increase 
from behind them. 

'This's my first time above 
the Twentieth Level," 
Rusche confided. "Thirtyfive years and I never saw 
the Outside. I don't think I 
like it up this high." 

"It will be over in a little 
while, Ted. Probably just a 
group of teen-agers looking 
for thrills." He laughed drily. 
"They'll end up with blanked 
memories and new faces like 
those who tried before them." 

"Listen," muttered Rusche. 

In the lightlessness, and 
above the wailing of the terrified people about them, 
they could hear the scuff of 



124 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



running feet. They were 
coming closer at a swift pace. 
In a moment the runners 
would collide with them! 

Duggan's years of blindness had given him the 
ability to judge and gauge 
distance from sound. At the 
proper instant he pounced, his 
hands clamping around a 
body, and a second body 
crashed into the leader. They 
went down in a tangle. 

He heard Rusche shouting 
and fists battering and the 
tinkle of metal or crystal on 
metal. He was fighting desperatefy, his super mech's 
strength overtaxed. The unseen man's hands tore at his 
neck and shoulder, ripping 
away the synthetic flesh and 
baring the complex framework beneath. 

Then his hand caught an 
arm and he exerted the full 
strength of his mech power, 
until now carefully subdued. 
The entire arm tore away 
from its shoulder. A.nd yet 
the wounded man continued 
to attack. 

It was only then that he 
realized this must be a super 
mech. The criminals must 
have stolen one or two super 
mechs and were using them 
in this robbery. 

He was ruthless, then. He 
wrenched away the other 
arm. He battered at the unseen torso. The feet of the 
desperate mech smashed at 
his knees and thighs, staggering him. Then he bore the 



armless torso of the mech 
backward and fell upon it. 

The mech went limp, its 
mentrols blanked by the distant crlrr.'nrJ who controlled 
it. 

Dug£".n came to his feet, 
listening for the sound of 
battle between Rusche and 
his cantive. It came from his 
right, "faintly. About ten feet 
distant, he judged it. And 
now the emergency vents 
were clearing the darkness 
from the travel strips. Twilight faded and vision replaced it. 

Rusche was sitting astride 
a prone body, and even as 
Duggan reached his side the 
struggling criminal's arms 
and legs went limp. Rusche 
grunted and started to stand. 

"A super mech!" he said. 
He rubbed thoughtfully at 
his disarranged nose and 
cheeks, smoothing them 
again into their normal contours. "What about yours?" 

"The same." 

"Here's their loot, anyhow," Rusche said, holding 
up a small gray plastine bag. 

"Drop it, Ted. We better 
fade out of here before the 
Squads arrive, too. They 
might think we're — " 

"Not on your life, Al. We 
should get a reward. Pics on 
the newswires and tapes." 

Duggan shrugged and 
smoothed at his own neck 
and face. Four red-uniformed 
men, their heads hidden by 
Ovoid gas helmets, came hissing toward them along the 



SECOND SIGHT 



125 



travel strip. They rode single-wheeled cycles and their 
rapid fire expoders - were 
trained on them. 

"Careful now, Ted. Let me 
do the talking. They like to 
use paralysis needles and 
question later." 

"But—" 

"I've lived up here." 
The unicycles braked to a 
halt. 

"Step over here, slow," ordered one of the squadmen. 

Duggan obeyed, careful to 
keep his arras rigid. Of 
course paralysis needles 
would cause this mech body 
no damage, but why make 
trouble? They had more destructive weapons. 

"Ran into us," he said 
mildly. "We figured something wrong — li o n e s t men 
would be standing where 
they were. We stopped 
them." 

The four members of the 
Squad were inspecting the 
damage. 

"I guess you did," one of 
them said, admiringly. "You 
must be super mechs too?" 

"That's right. I'm Duggan, 
Al — Merle Duggan, and this 
is my friend, Ted Rusche. 
We work on the 80th Level — 
rockhounds." 

"Duggan?" The man's voice 
was suddenly strained. "Maybe you're not so clear as you 
pretend. A woman got in the 
way by accident, supposedly, 
of their getaway from the 
bank. Her name was Duggan 
too." 



Duggan started forward, remembered the ugly expoder 
muzzles and backed away. 

"Was her name Janith?" he 
demanded. 

"Radio report didn't say. 
Contact them, Joe," he told 
one of the other faceless men. 

"Couldn't be you hired 
these two to kill her and pretend the robbery?" he inquired. 

"Of course not." 

One of the Squad mumbled 
something. Duggan's interregator dropped his weapon's 
muzzle. 

"Woman twisted her ankle 
trying to get out of the way, 
and fell. Received a cut on her 
temple and is being taken to 
the hospital. Accidental all 
right." 

"But her name." 

"Janith." 

Duggan felt a strange mingling of anger and of tenderness. The anger was directed 
toward the criminals. 

"Could I pr to her now? 
Rusche can fill you in on 'detail;-." 

"It's not — oh, all right. 
Regulations aren't too strict 
on these Levels. She your 
sister?" 

"Wife." He turned to 
Rusche. 

"See you at the lift in 
about an hour," he said and 
headed for the advertising 
agency where Janith was employed. 

"We haven't been informed 
as to her w hereabouts 



126 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



yet, Mr. Duggan," the receptionist at Duffey's offices 
said coldly. 

Duggan glared down into 
the carefully pretty face, the 
solar lamp tan and the knifesmoothed wrinkles. 

"Now see here, Blanche," he 
said, and spluttered impotent
"See here yourself, Merle 
Duggan," the woman spat 
back sharply. "After all! You 
come running back just because she's hurt. Why didn't 
you come back like this a 
year ago?" 

"I was with her a year ago." 

"That wasn't you. You 
didn't have guts enough to 
rent a super mech and go 
back to your old job." The 
woman laughed. "Janith tried 
to insult and needle you into 
being a man again. And you 
just crawled." 

"That's a lie," Duggan 
cried. "I begged her to let me 
go back. She wouldn't listen." 

"That's what you say now. 
You don't want to remember. 
I know. I was here all the 
time. Many a time Janith has 
come to the office, crying, 
and told me how hopeless it 
seemed." 

"You're — you're inventing 
fcll this Blanche," he accused. 

"I wish I were. Remember, 
Merle. Think. Be honest with 
yourself." Blanche put her 
nervous, blue-veined hand on 
his arm. A detached part of 
his brain noted how bony and 
brittle her hand was. 

"She's loved you all these 



years, Merle." The tiny hand 
dug into his jacket sleeve. "To 
make you well again she 
risked losing your love — and 
she lost." 

Blanche must be all of fifty, perhaps fifty-five, the analytical portion of his mind 
noted. Old maidish in many 
ways, despite her five exhusbands; yet so sentimental— 

"It's all part of her scheme. 
Pretend to be the patient, 
long-suffering wife and then 
secretly forbid me to go back 
to the deep levels again! You 
don't know !" 

The woman's tired eyes 
sparkled green. Her little 
fist cracked against his chest. 
She turned half away from 
him. 

"But I do know. I sat up 
with yoy many nights, while 
Janith got a few hours of 
rest. You were like a baby, 
slobbering and whimpering in 
your sleep. The days were 
worse. You were drunk and 
shouting and weeping. To 
you blindness was the end." 

Merle gulped. He could remember nothing of the sort. 
Only the accident and awakening in the hospital to darkness... But there was a 
strange blankness, a hiatus 
in his memories, that ended 
with his hated job in the cigar 
stand. He could not recall 
his first day there or — 

Could Blanche be telling 
the truth? 

"You— spiteful old hagt" 



SECOND SIGHT 



127 



he shouted at her, and rushed 
out of the offices. 

His feet pounded at the 
yielding softness of the walkway. The hospital was less 
than two blocks distant — no 
need to take a travel strip — 
and he needed the automatic 
motion of walking to steady 
his thoughts. 

The forgotten months. 
Four months, or was it five 
months, ago, he was in the 
cigar and news stand. That 
was the day when an old acquaintance from the lower 
levels sold him the chance on 
the 80th Level breakthrough. 

That night he had begged 
Janith to let him rent a super 
mech. And she had scoffed 
at his wastefulness. Yet, now 
that he remembered it again, 
there had been a wistful note 
of hope in her voice. 

Could she have been trying 
to fan his faint desire for 
sight into something more 
powerful and consuming — so 
he would become again the 
engineering Duggan he had 
been? 

He had surrendered then, as 
he did many times afterward. 
Sullenly, yes, but he had surrendered. Perhaps she knew 
he was not ready for sight. 
When he refused to obey her, 
when he insisted on hiring a 
super mech — then, perhaps, 
she would know the cure was 
Complete. 

But that was only theory. 
He remembered her clearly 
expressed hatred for the 
mucking, lower-level life of a 



rockhound. Always his hatred 
for her grew as she spoke of 
his work. . . 

She had never expressed 
herself in that way before the 
accident. She had gone with 
him on many exploratory 
trips into the caverns that the 
lower levels of Appalachia 
cu across. And she had enjoyed the experience — he was 
sure of that. 

Remember ! Think back. 
Back before the cigars and 
papers. Back to the days and 
months after the accident. It 
hurt to think. His temples, 
here on the mentrol-hooded 
sleeping plate, were pounding 
irregularly. 

Huddling in a bed, knees 
drawn up and head tucked in, 
trying to gain somehow the 
safety that an infant once 
knew. Janith's voice, soft and 
understanding, and the acid 
of panic that set his lips to 
mumbling meaningless jargon... 

Why had Janith not sent 
him to the medical centers for 
mental clearing and re-education as was done with all cases 
of psychoed abnormals? The 
answer was with him. She 
loved him as he was, Merle 
Duggan — not as a new personality in her husband's 
body. 

Artificially amnesia automatically dissolves all marriage partnerships. She had 
not wanted that. Instead she 
had three years of hell. . . 

Striking out at emptiness, 
his fists contacting soft flesh, 



128 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



and the pained cry, swiftly 
suppressed, of Janith. His 
voice, cursing and highpitched, as he fought the 
straps that now were restraining his sightless body. The 
bite of a needle and gradual 
dissolution of feeling... 

Memory was coming reluctantly back to Duggan. This 
was not the self-imagined visionings of an abused helpless 
man. These memories were 
true. He had fought against 
all mental therapy and turned 
from those who loved him. 

Now the hospital entrance 
was before him. He paused for 
a moment and then went inside. The automatic hush of 
the door shutting out the 
muted street sounds was alltoo familiar. 

"Mrs. Janith Duggan," he 
told the crisply white woman 
at the desk. 

"Koom 212, second floor." 

"Thank you." 

He used the steps in 
preference to the lift. He 
needed more time to think — 
would he ever find enough 
time? 

Undoubtedly, now, Janith's 
love for him was dead. His 
desertion of her must have 
finished the dissolution of 
their marriage. It had been 
cowardly — he should have 
faced her and declared what 
he was going to do and what 
she could do. 

These past weeks, working 
with the rock hogs, had been 
invaluable. They had restored 



something of his self esteem. 

The second floor. Pastel 
bare walls and soft voices.
