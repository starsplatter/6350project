CONSENSUS 



IT IS very doubtful if any science fiction magazine has ever 
received the volume of letters 
that 
 has 
drawn from readers. Just as remarkable is the breakdown, which is 
10% from active fans, 90% from 
non-letter writers, who, having been 
assured they had a concrete vote in 
Jhe planning of this magazine, 
wrote eagerly. 

This breaking of habitual reluctance to participate shows attitudes 
toward publishing policy that are 
commonly absent from science fiction letter departments, appearing 
only in individual letters that are 
usually attacked by the vocal 
minority, which, because of its activity, is often regarded as the 
majority. 

The fact is. that non- writing readers have very definite preferences 
that are not shared by active fans, 
yet it has been the active fans who 
have mainly influenced the policies 
of science fiction magazines. 

Let's take, first, the areas of 
agreement: 

• The physical makeup of GALAXY has been overwhelmingly 
approved, less than 10% arguing 
for either large or pulp format. The 
large size, 8V2"xll", allows better 
display, but at the expense of portability. The pulp format is a relic 
of the 1920s and should properly 



be displayed alongside illuminated 
manuscripts. 

• 87% vote in favor of general 
articles, written briefly and in nontechnical language. Almost the same 
percentage, 79%, favor an article 
every other issue or so, with the 
space thus saved devoted to fiction. 
The majority advises the minority 
to find its technical articles in science journals. 

• Our policy of challenging writers 
to present themes that could not be 
sold elsewhere . . . themes too adult, 
too profound or revolutionary in 
concept . . . has been endorsed by 
active fans and non-vocal readers 
alike. You've seen examples of this 
in previous issues; there will be 
more and more as writers accept 
our high standards. 

• Editorial balance has also been 
approved, although a turn in the 
vote on serials indicates that a 
compromise would be appreciated. 
Therefore, the next issue will not 
begin a serial, and future policy 
will be, wherever possible, to 
run an issue of complete stories 
between serials. And what will the 
next serial be? You'll get the announcement next month . . . 

It's a publishing coup! 

• Editorials, unfortunately, have 
the support of all but .03% and 
myself. Subject matter wanted, however, is a surprise, though it prob


2 




 



ably should not' be : readers are 
interested in science fiction and 
would like it discussed. Now that 
the styling and slant- of GALAXY 
have been decided for us by you, 
science fiction will be the main 
agenda of these editorials '. . . how 
its ideas come into being, who 
writes it, the new directions that 
GALAXY is exploring, etc. 

• There is no Five Star Shelf this 
month only because Groff Conklin 
is ill. The number who dislike his 
department is so small that it's not 
worth putting into percentage. 
More wanted the . column held 
down, however, than expanded, so 
it will continue at three' to four 
pages maximum. 

NOW we come to the divergences between active fan and 
non-participating reader: 

• Si7r of all letters state flatly that 
they want no letter department. In 
a vote of this size, amounting to a 
poll across the country and through 
almost all occupations and levels of 
education, the conclusion is inescapable: the enormous majority of 
readers would rather have stories 
than read the mail of an infinitesimal number of fans. This is not 
minimizing the value of fandom, 
which has been loyal to science fiction even when loyalty was undeserved, but a realization that it is 
tyranny to force the majority to 
submit to the will of a minority. 
GALAXY will therefore not have 
a letter department. As requested 



by many readers, though, letters of 
special interest will be discussed 
editorially. 

• Story ratings have been demanded mainly by fans — and writers, 
who, of course, have to be kept 
happy. Twice a year, as a result, 
stories will be rated in editorials, 
according to reader preference . . . 
with my opinions, either in agreement or disagreement, and the 
reasons therefor. The first listing 
should be in the May issue, if votes 
are in on all six previous issues. 

• Almost 1007? of the vote was 
against fan coverage of any kind. 
This, it is rightly pointed out, is 
handled elsewhere more adequately 
than it could be here. 

That brings us, finally, to a 
matter in which we of GALAXY 
disagree with some of our readers. 
The subject is art . . . 

Yes, we have been experimenting both in art and in technical 
processes, since we believe that a 
rebirth in science fiction should not 
be breeched by art of the forceps 
school. This month marks another 
experiment: halftone reproduction 
of photographs and wash drawings. 
This could not be done without 
trying out our technical processes. 
As we extend control, we will present other improvements that are 
now being worked on. 

You'll see them soon. The results, we think, will be far better — 
before too long — than present science fiction art.

The Wind 



Before man could visit the nearest planets, he 
was traveling to the most distant stars. Pure 
paradox, of course, and one with doom built in! 



IT WAS hot in the dome of the 
Bennington matter transmitter 
building. The metal shielding 
walls seemed to catch the rays of 
the sun and bring them to a focus 
there. Even the fan that was 
plugged in nearby didn't help 
much. Vic Peters shook his head, 
flipping the mop of yellow hair out 
of his eyes. He twisted about, so 
the fan could reach fresh territory, 
and cursed under his breath. 

Heat he could take. As a roving 
troubleshooter for Teleport Interstellar, he'd worked from Rangoon 
to Nairobi — but always with men. 
Pat Trevor was the first of the few 
women superintendents he'd met. 
And while he had no illusions of 
masculine supremacy, he'd have felt 
a lot better working in shorts or 
nothing right now. 

Besides, a figure Jike Par's 
couldn't be forgotten, even though 



denim coveralls were hardly supposed to be flattering. Qoth 
stretched tight across shapely hips 
had never helped a man concentrate on his work. 

She looked down at him, grinning easily. Her arm came up to 
toss her hair back, leaving a 
smudge on her forehead to match 
one on her nose. She wasn't exactly 
pretty, but the smile seemed to 
illumine her gray eyes, and even 
the metal shavings in her brown 
hair couldn't hide the red highlights. 

"One more bolt, Vic," she told 
him. "Pheooh, I'm melting ... So 
what happened to your wife?" 

He shrugged. "Married her lawyer right after the divorce. Last I 
knew, they were doing fine. Why 
not? It wasn't her fault. Between 
hopping all over the world and 
spending my spare time trying to 




 



Between the Worlds

THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



get on the moon rocket they were 
building, I wasn't much of a husband." 

Unconsciously, his lips twisted. 
He'd grown up before DuQuesne 
discovered the matter transmitter, 
when reaching the other planets of 
the Solar System had been the 
dream of most boys. Somehow, that 
no longer seemed important to people, now that the world was linked 
through Teleport Interstellar with 
races all across the Galaxy. 

MAN had always been a topsyturvy race. He'd discovered 
gunpowder before chemistry, and 
battled his way up to the atom bomb 
in a scant few thousand years of 
civilization, before he had a worldwide government. Other races, apparently, developed space travel 
long before the matter-transmitter, 
and long after they'd achieved a 
genuine science of sociology. 

DuQuesne had started it by investigating some obscure extensions 
of Dirac's esoteric mathematics. To 
check up on his work, he'd built a 
machine, only to find that it produced results beyond his expectations, matter in it simply seemed 
to disappear, releasing energy that 
was much less than it should have 
been, but still enough to destroy 
the machine. 

DuQuesne and his students had 
rechecked their math against the results and come up with an answer 
they didn't believe. This time they 
built two machines and experiment


ed with them until they worked 
together. When the machines were 
operating, anything within the 
small fields they generated simply 
changed places. At first it was just 
across a few yards, then miles — 
then half around the world. Matter 
was transmitted almost instantaneously from one machine to the other 
no matter how far apart they were. 

Such a secret couldn't be kept, of 
course. DuQuesne gave a demonstration to fellow scientists at which 
a few reporters were present. They 
garbled DuQuesne's explanation of 
electron waves covering the entire 
universe that were capable of 
identity shifts, but the accounts of 
the actual experiment were convincing enough. It meant incredibly fast 
shipping anywhere on the globe at 
an impossibly low cost. 

The second public demonstration 
played to a full house of newsmen 
and cold-headed businessmen. It 
worked properly — a hundred 
pounds of bricks on one machine 
changed place with a hundred 
pounds of coal on another. But 
then . . . 

Before their eyes, the coal disappeared and a round ball came 
into existence, suspended in midair. It turned around as if seeking 
something, an eyelike lens focused 
on the crowd. Then it darted down 
and knocked the power plug loose. 
Nothing could budge it, and no 
tricks to turn on power again 
worked. 

Even to the businessmen, it was 



6 




 



obvious that this object, whatever 
it was, had not been made on Earth. 
DuQuesne himself suggested that 
somewhere some other race must 
have matter transmittal, and that 
this was apparently some kind of 
observer. Man, unable to reach even 
his own moon yet, had apparently 
made contact with intelligence from 
some other world, perhaps some 
solar system, since there was no 
theoretical limit to the distance covered by matter transmittal. 

It was a week of wild attempts 
to crack open the "observer" and 
of futile attempts to learn something about it. Vic's mind had been 
filled with Martians, and he had 
tried to join the thousands who 
flocked to DuQuesne's laboratory 
to see the thing. But his father had 
been stubborn — no fare for such 
nonsense. And Vic had had to wait 
until the papers sprang the final 
surprise, a week later. 

THE ball had suddenly moved 
aside and made no effort to 
stop the machine from operating. 
When power was turned on, it had 
disappeared, and this time the Envoy had appeared. There was nothing outlandish about him — he 
seemed simply a "normal man, stepping out of the crude machine. 

In normal English, he had addressed the crowd with the casual 
statement that he was a robot, designed deliberately to serve as an 
ambassador to Earth from the 
Galactic Council. He was simply to 



be the observer and voice of the 
Council, which was made up of all 
worlds having the matter transmitter. They had detected the transmitter radiation, and, by Galactic 
Law, Earth had automatically 
earned provisional status. He was 
here to help set up transmitter 
arrangements. Engineers from Betz 
would build transports to six 
planets of culture similar to 
Earth's, to be owned by the Council, as a non-profit business, but 
manned by Earthmen as quickly as 
they could be trained. 

In return, nothing was demanded, and nothing more was offered. 
We were a primitive world by their 
standards, but we would have to 
work out our own advancement, 
since they would give no extra 
knowledge. 

He smiled pleasantly to the 
shocked crowd and moved off with 
DuQuesne to await results. There 
were enough, too, from a startled 
and doubting world. The months 
that followed were a chaos of news 
and half-news. The nations were 
suspicious. There was never something for nothing. The Envoy met 
the President and Cabinet; he met 
the United Nations. India walked 
out; India walked back quickly 
when plans went ahead blithely 
without her. Congress proposed 
tariffs and protested secret treaties. 
The Envoy met Congress, and 
somehow overcame enough opposition to get a bare majority. 

And the Betz II engineers came

on schedule. Man was linked to the 
stars, though his own planets were 
still outside his reach. It was a paradox that soon grew stale, but what, 
actually, would be the point in flying to Mars or Venus when we 
were in instant touch with the 
farthest parts of the Galaxy? 

There were major wrenches to 
the economy as our heavy industries suddenly found that other 
planets could beat them at their 
work. Plathgol could deliver a perfect Earth automobile, semi-assembled and advanced enough to avoid 
our patent laws, for twenty pounds 
of sugar. The heavy industries 
folded, while we were still experimenting with the business of finding what we had to offer and what 
we could receive from other 
worlds. Banks had crashed, men 
had been out of work. The governments had cushioned the shock, 
and the new wonders helped to 
still the voices that suddenly rose 
up against traffic with alien worlds. 
But it had been a bitter period, 
with many lasting scars. 

Now a measure of stability had 
been reached, with a higher standard of living than ever. But the 
hatreds were pretty deep on the 
part of those who had been hurt, 
and others who simply hated newness and change. Vic had done 
well enough, somehow making his 
way into the first engineering class 
out of a hundred thousand applicants. And twelve years had gone 



Pat's voice suddenly cut into his 
thoughts. "All tightened up here, 
Vic. Wipe the scowl off and let's 
go down to check." 

She collected her tools, wrapped 
her legs around a smooth pole, and 
went sliding down. He yanked the 
fan and followed her. Below was 
the crew. Pat lifted an eyebrow at 
the grizzled, cadaverous head operator. "Okay, Amos. Plathgol standing by?" 

AMOS pulled his six-feet-two up 
from his slump and indicated 
the yellow stand-by light. Inside the 
twin poles of the huge transmitter 
that was tuned to one on Plathgol, 
a big, twelve-foot diameter plastic 
-cylinder held a single rabbit. Matter transmitting was always a twoway affair, requiring that the same 
volume be exchanged. And between 
the worlds, where different atmospheres and pressures were involved, 
all sending was done in the big 
capsules. One-way handling was 
possible, of course, but involved 
the danger of something materialize 
ing to occupy the same space a% 
something else — even air molecules. 
It wasn't done except as rigidly 
controlled experiments. 

Amos whistled into the transportwave interworld phone in the code 
that was universal between worlds, 
got an answering whistle, and 
pressed a lever. The rabbit was 
gone, and the new capsule was 
faintly pink, with something -resembling a giant worm inside. 




 



Amos clucked in satis/action. 
"Tsiuna. Good eating, only real 
good we ever got from these 
things. I got friends on Plathgol 
that like rabbit. Want some of this, 
Pat?" 

Vic felt his stomach jerk at the 
colors that crawled over the tsiuna. 
The hot antiseptic spray was running over the capsule, to be 
followed by supersonics and ultraviolets to complete sterilization. 
Amos waited a moment, then 
pulled out the creature. Pat 
hefted it. 

"Big one. Bring it over to my 
place and I'll fry it for you and 
Vic. How does the Dirac meter 
read, Vic?" 

"On the button." The seven per 
cent power loss was gone now, 
after a week of hard work in locating it. "Guess you were right— the 
reflector was off angle. Should have 
tried it first, but it never happened 
before. How'd you figure it out?" 

SHE indicated the interworld 
phone. "I started out in anthropology, Vic. Got interested in other 
races, and then found I couldn't 
talk to the teleport engineers without being one, so I got sidetracked 
to this job. But I still talk a lot on 
anything Galactic policy won't forbid. When everything else failed, 
I complained to the Ecthinbal operator that the Betz II boys installed 
us wrong. I got sympathy instead 
of indignation, so I figured it could 
happen. Simple, wasn't it?" 



He snorted, and waited while she 
gave orders to start business. Then, 
as the loading cars began to hum, 
she fell behind him, moving out 
toward the office. "I suppose you'll 
be leaving tonight, Vic. I'll miss 
you. You're the only troubleshooter 
I've met who did more than make 
passes." 

"When I make passes at your 
kind of girl, it will be legal. And 
in my business, it's no life for a 
wife." 

But he stopped to look at the 
building, admiring it for the last 
time. It was the standard Betz II 
design, but designed to handle the 
farm crops around, and bigger than 
any earlier models on Earth. The 
Betz II engineers made Earth 
engineering look childish, even if 
they did look like big slugs with 
tentacles and had no sense of sight. 

The transmitters were in the circular center, surrounded by a shield 
wall, a wide hall all around, another 
shield, a circular hall again, and „ 
finally the big outside shield. The 
two opposite entranceways spiraled 
through the three shields, each rotating thirty degrees clockwise 
from the entrance portal through 
the next shield. Those shields were 
of inert matter that could be damaged by nothing less violent than a 
hydrogen bomb directly on them — 
they refused to soften at less than 
ten million degrees Kelvin. How 
the Betzians managed to form them 
in the first place, nobody knew. 

Beyond the transmitter building, 



THE WIND- BETWEEN THE WORLDS

however, the usual offices and local 
transmitters across Earth had not 
yet been built. That would be 
strictly Earth construction, and 
would have to wait for an off season. They were using the nearest 
building, an abandoned store a 
quarter mile away, as -a temporary 
office. 

Pat threw the door open and 
then stopped suddenly. "Ptheela!" 

APLATHGOLIAN native sat 
on a chair, with a bundle of 
personal belongings around her, her 
three arms making little marks on 
something that looked like a used 
pancake. The Plathgolians had 
been meat-eating plants once. They 
still smelled high to Earth noses, 
and their constantly shedding skin 
resembled shaggy bark, while their 
heads were vaguely flowerlike. 

Ptheela wriggled her arms. "The 
hotel found regretfully that it had 
to decorate my room," she whistled 
in Galactic Code. "No other room 
and all other hotels say they're full. 
Plathgolians stink, I guess. So I'll 
go home when the transmitter is 
fixed." 

"With your trade studies half 
done?" Pat protested. "Don't be 
silly, Ptheela. I've got a room for 
you m my apartment. How arc the 
studies, anyhow ?" 

For answer, the plant woman 
passed over a newspaper, folded to 
one item. "Trade? Your House of 
Representatives just passed a tariff 
on all traffic through Teleport." 



Pat scanned the news, scowling. 
"Damn them. A tariff! They can't 
tax interstellar traffic. The Galactic 
Council won't stand for it; we're 
still accepted only on approval. The 
Senate will never okay it!" 

Ptheela whistled doubtfully, and 
Vic nodded. "They will. I've been 
expecting this. A lot of people are 
afraid of Teleport." 

"But we're geared to it now. The 
old factories are torn down, the 
new ones are useless for us. We 
can't get by without the catalysts 
from Ecthinbal, the cancer-preventative from Plathgol, all the rest. And 
who'll buy all our sugar ? We're 
producing fifty times what we need, 
just because most planets don't 
have plants that separate the levo 
from the dextro forms. All hell will 
pop!" 

Ptheela wiggled her arms again. 
"You came too early. Your culture 
is 'unbalanced. All physics, no sociology. All eat well, little think 
well." 

Ail emotion, little reason, Vic 
added to himself. It had been the 
same when the industrial revolution came along. Old crafts were 
uprooted and some people were 
hurt. There were more jobs now, 
but they weren't the familiar ones. 
And the motorists who gloated at 
first over cheap Plathgol cars complained when Plathgol wasn't permitted to supply the improved, 
ever-powered models they made for 
themselves. 

Hardest of all had been the idea 



10 




 



of accepting the existence ot* superior races. A feeling of inferiority 
had crept in, turned to resentment, 
and then through misunderstanding of other races to an outright 
hatred of them. Ptheela had been 
kicked out of her hotel room; but 
it was only a minor incident in a 
world full of growing bitterness 
against the aliens. 

Maybe we can get j obs on 
Plathgol," Vic suggested harshly. 

Ptheela whistled. "Pat could, if 
she had three husbands— engineers 
must meet minimum Standards. You 
could be a husband, maybe." 

Vic kept forgetting that Plathgol 
was backward enough to have taboos and odd customs, even though 
Galactically higher than Earth, having had nearly ten thousand years 
of history behind her to develop 
progress and amity. 

THE televisor connecting them 
with the transmitter building 
buzzed, and Amos' dour face came 
on. "Screwball delivery with top 
priority, Pat. Professor named 
Douglas wants to ship a capsule of 
Heaviside layer air for a capsule 
of Ecthinbal deep-space vacuum. 
Common sense says we don't make 
much shipping vacuums ■ by the 
pound !" 

"Public service, no charge," Vic 
suggested, and Pat nodded. Douglas was a top man at Caitech, and 
a plug from him might be useful 
sometime. "Leave it on, Amos — 1 
want to watch this. Douglas has 



some idea that space fluctuates, 
somehow, and he can figure out 
where Ecthinbal is from a sample. 
Then he can figure how fast an 
exchange force works, whether it's 
instantaneous or not. We've got the 
biggest Earth transmitters, so he 
uses us." 

As they watched, a massive capsule was put in place by loading 
machines,' and the light changed 
From yellow to red. A slightly 
greenish capsule replaced the other. 
Amos signaled the disinfection crew 
and hot spray hit it, to be followed 
by the ultrasonics. Something 
crackled suddenly, and Amos made 
a wild lunge across the screen. 

The capsule popped, crashing inward and scattering glass in a thousand directions. Pressure-glass; it 
should have carried a standard Code 
warning for cold sterilization and 
no supersonics. Vic leaped toward 
the transmitter building. 

Pat's cry brought him back. 
There were shrieks coming from 
the televisor. Men in the building 
were clinging frantically to anything they could hold, but men 
and bundles ready for loading were 
being picked up violently and 
sucked toward the transmitter. As 
Vic watched, a man hit the edge 
of the field and seemed to be sliced 
into nothingness, his scream cut off, 
half-formed. 

A big chunk of glass had hit the 
control, shorting two bus-bars, 
holding them together by its 
weight. The transmitter was locked 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



11 



into continuous transmit. And air, 
with a pressure of fifteen pounds 
per square inch, was running in and 
being shipped to Ecthinbal, where 
the pressure was barely an ounce 
per square inch! With that difference, pressure on a single square 
foot of surface could lift over a 
ton. The poor devils in the transmitter building didn't have a 
chance. 

He snapped off the televisor as 
Pat turned away, gagging. "When 
was the accumulator charged?*' 

"It wasn't an accumulator," she 
told him weakly. "The whole plant 
uses an electron-pulse atomotor, 
good for twenty years of continuous operation." 

Vic swore and made for the 
door, with Pat and Ptheela after 
him. The transmitter opening took 



up about two hundred square feet, 
which meant somewhere between 
fifty and five hundred thousand 
cubic feet of air a second were being lost. Maybe worse. 

Ptheela nodded as she kept pace 
with him. "I think the tariff won't 
matter much now," she stated. 

II 

VIC'S action in charging out had 
been pure instinct to get where 
the trouble lay. His legs churned 
over the ground, while a wind at 
his back made the going easier. 

Then his brain clicked over, and 
he dug his heels into the ground, 
trying to stop. Pat crashed into him, 
but Ptheela's arms lashed out, keeping him from falling. As he turned 
to face them, the wind struck at his 




\2 




 



face, whipping up grit and dust 
from the dry ground. Getting to 
the transmitter building would be 
easy — but with the wind already 
rising, they'd never be able to light 
their way back. 

It had already reached this far, 
losing its force with distance, but 
still carrying a wallop. It was beginning to form a pattern, marked 
by the clouds of dust and debris it 
was picking up. The arrangement 
of the shields and entrances in the 
building formed a perfect suction 
device to set the air circling around 
it counter-clockwise, twisting into a 
tornado that funnclcd down to the 
portals. Men and women near the 
building were struggling frantically 
away from the center of the fury. 
As he watched, a woman was 
picked up bodily, whirled around, 



and gulped down one of the yawning entrances. The wind strangled 
her cries. 

Vic motioned Pat and Ptheela 
and began moving back, fast. Killing himself would do no good. He 
found one of the little hauling tractors and pulled them onto it with 
him, heading back until they were 
out of the worst of the rising wind. 
Then he' swung to face Ptheela. 

"Galactic rules be damned, this 
is an emergency, and we need help! 
What now?" 

The shaggy Plathgolian made an 
awkward gesture with all three 
arms, and a slit opened in her chest. 
"Unprecedented." The word came 
out in English, surprisingly, and 
Pat's look mirrored his; Plathgolians weren't supposed to be able to 
talk. "You're right. If I speak, I 




THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



13 



shall be banished by the Council 
from Plathgol. Ask, nevertheless. I 
may know more — we've had the 
teleport longer — but remember that 
your strange race has a higher ingenuity quotient." 

"Thanks." Vic knew what the 
seven husbands back on her home 
planet meant to her, if she were 
exiled, but he'd worry about that 
after he could stop worrying about 
the world. "What happens next?" 

She dropped back to the faster 
Galactic Code for that. As he knew, 
the accidental turning on of the 
transmitter had keyed in the one on 
Ecthinbal automatically to receive, 
but not to transmit; the air was 
moving between Earth and Ecthinbal in one-way traffic. The receiving 
circuit, which would have keyed in 
the Ecthinbal transmit circuit had 
not been shorted. Continuous transmittal had never been used, to her 
knowledge; there was no certainty 
about what would happen. Once 
started, no outside force could stop 
a transmitter; the send and stop 
controls were synchronous, both 
tapped from a single crystal, and 
only that proper complex waveform could cut it off. It now existed as a space-strain, and the 
Plathgolians . believed that this 
would spread, since the outer edges 
transmitted before matter could 
reach the center, setting up an unbalanced resonance that would make 
the force field grow larger and 
larger. Eventually, it might spread 
far beyond the whole building. 



And, of course, since the metal 
used by the Betz II engineers could 
not be cut or damaged, there was 
no way of tunneling in. 

"What about Ecthinbal?" Pat 
asked. 

PTHEELA spread her arms. 
"The same, in reverse. The air 
rushes in, builds up pressure to 
break the capsule, and then rushes 
out — in a balanced stream, fortunately, so there"s no danger of crowding two units of matter in one 
unit of space." 

"Then I guess we'd better call 
the Galactic Envoy," Vic decided. 
"All he*s ever done is to sit in an 
office and look smug. Now — " 

"He won't come. He is simply 
an observer. Galactic Law says you 
must solve your own problem or 
die." 

"Yeah." Vic looked at the cloud 
of dust being whirled into the transmitter building. "And all I need 
is something that weighs a couple 
tons per square foot — with a good 
crane attached." 

Pat looked up suddenly. "How 
about one of the small atom-powered army tanks, the streamlined 
ones? Flavin could probably get 
you one." 

Vic stamped down "on the pedal, 
swinging the little tractor around 
sharply toward the office. The wind 
was stronger there, but still buckable. He clicked the televisor on, 
noticing that the dust seemed to 
disappear just beyond the normal 



14 




 



field of the transmitter. It must already be starting to .spread out. 

"How about it?" he asked 
Ptheela. " If it spreads, won't it 
start etching into the transmitter 
and the station ?" 

"No. Betz II construction. 
Everything they built in has some 
way of grounding out the effect. 
We don't know how it works, but 
the field won't touch anything put 
in by the Betzians." 

'"What about the hunk of glass 
that's causing the trouble?" 

For a moment she looked as if 
she were trying to appear hopeful. 
Then the flowerlike head seemed 
to wilt. "It's inside the casing, protected from the field." 

Pat had been working on the 
private wire to Chicago, used for 
emergencies. She was obviously 
having trouble getting put through 
lo Flavin. The man was a sore spot 
in Teleport Interstellar, one of the 
few political appointees. Nominally, he was a go-between for the 
President and the Teleport group, 
but actually he was simply a jobholder. Finally Pat had him on the 
screen. 

He was jovial enough, as usual, 
with a red spot on each cheek which 
indicated too many drinks for 
lunch. A bottle stood on the desk 
in front of him. But his voice was 
clear enough. "Hi, Pat. What's 
up?" 

Pat disregarded the frown Vic 
threw her, and began outlining the 
situation. The panic in her voice 



didn't require much feigning. 
Flavin blustered at first, then 
pressed the hold button for long 
minutes. Finally, his face reappeared. 

"Peters, you'll have full authority, of course. I'll get a couple 
tanks for you, somehow, but I 
have to work indirectly." Then he 
shrugged and looked rueful. "I always knew this sinecure would end. 
I've got some slips here that make 
it look as if you had a national 
disaster." 

His hand reached for the bottle, 
just as his eyes met Vic's accusing 
look. He shook his head, grinned 
sourly, put the bottle away in a 
drawer, untouched. "I'm not a fool 
entirely, Peters. I can do a little 
more than chase girls and drink. 
Probably be no use to you, but the 
only reason I drink is I'm bored, 
and I'm not bored now. I'll be out 
shortly." 

F.AVIN apparently had influence. The tanks arrived just 
before he did. They were heavy, 
squat affairs, super-armored to 
stand up under a fairly close 
atomic bomb hit, but small enough 
to plunge through the portals of 
the transmitter building. Flavin 
came up as Vic and Pat were studying them. His suit was designed 
to hide most of his waistline, but 
the fat of his jowls shook as he 
hurried up, and there was sweat on 
his forehead, trickling down from 
under his toupee. 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



15 



"Two, eh? Figured that's what 
I'd get if I asked for a dozen. 
Think you can get in — and what'Il 
you do then?" 

Vic shrugged. He'd been wondering the same thing. "If we 
could somehow ram the huge piece 
of glass and crack it where it was 
wedged into the wiring inside the 
shielding, it might release the 
shorted wires. That should effect 
an automatic cut-off. That's why I'm 
going with the driver. I can extemporize if we get in." 

"Right," Pat agreed cjuickly. She 
hitched up her coveralls and headed for the other tank. "And that's 
why I'm going with the other." 

"Pat!" Vic swung toward her. 
But it wasn't a time for stupid 
chivalry. The man or woman who 
could do the job should do it. He 
gave her a hand into the compact 
I i rtl e tank. ' 'Good 1 uck, then . 
We'll need it." 

He climbed into his own vehicle, 
crowding past the driver and 
wriggling into the tiny observer's 
seat. The driver glanced back, 
reached for the controls. The motor hummed quietly under them, 
making itself felt by the vibration 
of the metal around them. They 
began moving forward, advancing 
in low gear. The driver didn't like 
it as he stared through his telescreen, and Vic liked it even less 
from the direct view through the 
gun slit. Beside them, the other 
tank got into motion, roughly 
paralleling them. 



At first it wasn't too bad. They 
headed toward the north portal, 
going cautiously, and the tank 
seemed snug and secure. Beside 
him, Vic saw a tree suddenly come 
up by its roots and head toward 
the transmitter. It struck the front 
of the tank, but the machine 
pushed it brutally aside. 

Then the going got rough. The 
driver swore at the controls, finding the machine hard to handle. It 
wanted to drift, and he set up a 
fixed correction, only to revise it a 
moment later. The tank began to 
list and pitch. The force of the 
wind increased geometrically as 
they cut the distance. At fifty feet, 
the driver's wrists were white from 
fighting to overcome each tilt of 
the wind. t 

VIC swallowed, wondering at 
the nerve of the man driving, 
until he saw blood running from 
a bitten lip. His own stomach was 
pitching wildly. 

"Try another ten feet ?" the 
driver asked. 
"Have to." 

They crawled by inches now. 
Every tiny bump threatened to let 
the force of the wind pitch them 
over. They had to work by feel. 
Vic wiped his forehead and wiped 
it again before he noticed that the 
palm of his hand was as damp as 
his brow. 

He wondered about Pat and 
looked for her. There was no sight 
of the other machine. Thank God, 




 



shed turned back. But there was 
bitterness in his relief; he'd figured 
Pat was one human he could count 
on completely. Then he looked at 
the driver's wider screen, and sick 
shock hit him. 

The other tank had turned turtle 
and was rolling over and over, 
straight toward the portal! As he 
looked, a freak accident bounced 
it up and it landed on its treads. 
The driver must have been conscious; only consummate skill accounted for the juggling that kept 
it upright then. But its forward momentum was still too strong, and it 
lurched for the portal, 

Vic jerked against his driver's 
ear, pointing frantically. "Hit it!" 

The driver tensed, but nodded. 
Though the shriek of the insane 
wind was too strong for even the 
sound of the motor, the tank 
leaped forward, pushing Vic down 
in his webbed and padded seat. 
The chances they were taking now 
were pure gamble, but the driver 
moved more smoothly with a definite goal. The man Jet the wind 
help him pick up speed, jockeying 
sidewise toward the other tank. 
They almost rolled over as they 
swung, bucking and rocking frantically, but the treads hit the 
ground firmly again. They were 
drifting across the wind now, 
straight toward the nose of the 
other tank. 

Vic strained forward; the shock 
of hitting the tank knocked his 
head against the gun slit. He hard


ly felt it as he stared out. The two 
tanks struggled, forcing against 
each other, while the portal gaped 
almost straight ahead. 

"Hit the west edge and we have 
a chance," Vic yelled in the driver's ear. The man nodded weakly, 
and his foot pressed down harder 
on the throttle. Against each other, 
the two tanks showed little tendency to turn over, but they seemed 
to be lifted off the ground half the 
time. 

Inch by slow inch, they were 
making it. Pat's tank was well beyond the portal, but Vic's driver 
was sweating it out, barely on the 
edge. He bumped an inch forward, 
reversed with no care for gears, and 
hitched forward and back again. 
They seemed to make little progress, but finally Vic could see the 
edge move past, and they were out 
of the direct gale into the portal. 

ANEW screen had lighted beside the driver, and Pat's 
face was in it, along with the other 
driver. The scouring of the wind 
made speech impossible over the 
speakers, but the man motioned. 
Vic shook his head, indicated a 
spiral counter-clockwise and outward, to avoid bucking against the 
wind, with the two tanks supporting each other. 

They passed the south portal 
somehow, though there were moments when it seemed they must 
be swung in, and managed to gain 
ten feet outward on the turn. The 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



17 



next time around, they had doubled 
that. It began to be smoother going. The battered tanks lumbered 
up to their starting point and a 
little beyond. 

Vic crawled out of the seat, surprised to find his legs stiff and 
weak; the ground seemed to reel 
under him. It was some comfort 
to see that the driver was in no 
better shape. The man leaned 
against the tank, letting the raw 
wind dry the perspiration on his 
uniform. "Bro-ther! Miracles! 
You're nervy, guy, but I wouldn't 
go in there again with the angel 
Michael." 

Vic looked at the' wind maelstrom. Nobody else would go in 
there, either. Getting within ten 
feet of the portal was begging for 
death, even in the tank — and it 
would get worse. Then he spotted 
Pat opening the tank hatch and 
stumbled over to help her out. She 
was bruised and more shaky than 
he, but the webbing over the seat 
had saved her from broken bones. 
He lifted her out in his arms, surprised at how light she was. His 
mind flicked over the picture of 
her tank twisting over, and his 
arms tightened around her. She 
seemed to snuggle into them, seeking comfort. 

Her eyes came up, just as he 
looked down at her. There was no 
other way than kissing her to show 
his relief. "You scared hell out of 
me, Pat." 

"Me, too." She was regaining 



some color, and wriggled to be 
pur down. "Do you know how I 
feel about what you did in there?" 

Flavin cut off any answer Vic 
could have made, waddling up 
with his handkerchief out, mopping his face. He stared at them, 
gulped, shook his head. "Lazarus 
twins,*' he growled. "Better get in 
the car — there's a drink in the 
right door pocket." 

Vic looked at Pat and she 
nodded. They could use it. They 
found the car and chauffeur waiting farther back. Vic poured her a 
small jigger, and took one for himself before putting the bottle back. 
But the moment's relaxation over 
cigarets was better than the drink. 

WHILE Flavin was talking to 
the tank drivers, a small 
roll of bills changed hands, bringing grins to their faces. Political 
opportunist or not, he knew the 
right thing to do at the right time. 
Now he came back and climbed in 
beside them. 

"I've had the office moved back 
to Bennington. The intercity teleport manager offered us space." 
The locally owned world branches 
of intercity teleport were independent of Teleport Interstellar, but 
usually, granted courtesy exchanges 
with the latter. "They'll be evacuating the city next, if I know the 
Governor. Just got a cease and desist order — came while you were 
trying to commit suicide. We're to 
stop transmitting at once!" 




 



He grunted at Vic's grimace, and 
motioned the chauffeur on, just as 
a radiophone call reached them. 
Vic shook his head at the driver 
and looked out to see Pthcela 
ploughing along against the wind, 
calling to.them. The plant woman's 
skin was peeling worse than ever. 

Flavin followed Vic's eyes. "You 
going to let that ride with us? The 
way Plathies stink? Damned plants, 
you can't trust 'em. Probably mixed 
up in this trouble. I heard . . ." 

"Plathgol rates higher in civilization than we do," Pat stated 
flatly. 

"Yeah. Ten thousand years 
stealing culture we had to scratch 
up for ourselves in a thousand. So 
the Galactic Council tells us we've 
got to rub our noses to a superior 
race. Superior plants! Nuts!" 

Vic opened the door and reached 
for Pat's hand. Flavin frowned, 
fidgeted, then reached out to pull 
them back. "Okay, okay. I told you 
that you were in charge here. If 
you want to ride with stinking 
Plathies — well, you're running 
things. But don't blame me if 
people start throwing mud." He 
had the grace to redden faintly as 
Ptheela came up finally, and 
changed the subject hastily. "Why 
can't we just snap a big hunk of 
metal over the entrances and seal 
them up?" 

"Too late," Ptheela answered, 
sliding down beside Pat, her English drawing a surprised start from 
Flavin. "I was inspecting the tanks; 

THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



they're field-etched where they 
touched. That means the field is 
already outside the building, though 
it will spread more slowly without 
the metal to resonate it. Anyhow, 
you couldn't get metal plates up." 

"How long will the air last?" 
Pat asked. 

Vic shrugged. "A month at 
breathing level, maybe. Fortunately 
the field doesn't spread downward 
much, with the Betzian design, so 
it won't start working on the Earth 
itself. Flavin, how about getting 
the experts here? I need help." 

"Already sent for them," Flavin 
grunted. They were heading toward the main part of Bennington 
now, ten miles from the station. 
His face was gray and he no longer 
seemed to notice the somewhat 
pervasive odor of Ptheela. 

THEY drew up to a converted 
warehouse finally, and he gotout, starting up the steps just as 
the excited cries of a newsboy 
reached his ears. He flipped a coin 
and spread the extra before them. 

It was all over the front page, 
with alarming statements from the 
scientists first interviewed and 
soothing statements from later 
ones. No Teleport Interstellar man 
had spoken, hut an interview with 
one of the local teleport engineers 
had given the basic facts, along 
with some surprisingly keen guesses 
as to what would happen next. 

But above everything was the 
black headline: 

19 



BOMB TRANSMITTER, 
SAYS PAN- ASIA 

The ultimatum issued by PanAsia was filled with high-sounding 
phrases and noble justification, but 
its basic message was clear enough. 
Unless the loss of air — air that belonged to everyone — was stopped 
and all future transmitting of all 
types halted, together with all dealings with "alien anti-terrestrials," 
Pan-Asia would be forced to bomb 
the transmitters, together with all 
other resistance. 

"Maybe . . ." Flavin began 
doubtfully, but Vic cut him off. 
His faith in mankind's right to its 
accidental niche in the Galactic 
Council wasn't increasing much. 

"No dice. The field is a spacestrain that is permanent, ■ unless 
canceled by the right wave-form. 
The canceling crystal is in the 
transmitter. Destroy that and the 
field never can be stopped. It'll 
keep growing until the whole Earth 
is gone. Flavin, you'd better get 
those experts here fast!" 

Ill 

VIC sat in the car the next morning, watching the black cloud 
that swirled around the station, 
reaching well beyond the old office. 
His eyes were red, his face was 
gray with fatigue, and his lanky 
body was slumped onto the seat. 
Pat looked almost as tired, though 
she had gotten some sleep. Now 



she took the empty coffee cup and 
thermos from him. She ran a hand 
through his hair, straightening it, 
then pulled his head down to her 
shoulder and began rubbing the 
back of his neck gently. 

Pthecla purred approvingly from 
the other side, and Pat snorted. 
"Get your mind off romance, 
Ptheela! Vic's practically out on 
his feet. If he weren't so darned 
stubborn, this should make him go 
to sleep." 

"Romance!" Ptheela chewed the 
idea and spat it out. "All spring 
budding and no seed. A female 
should have pride from strong husbands and proven seeding." 

Vic let them argue. At the moment, Pat's attention was soothing, 
but only superficially. His head 
went on fighting for some usable 
angle and finding none. He'd 
swiped all the knowledge he could 
from Ptheela, without an answer. 
Plathgol was more advanced than 
Earth, but far below the Betz II 
engineers, who were mere servants 
of the Council. 

No wonder man had resented 
the traffic with other worlds. For 
centuries he had been the center of 
his universe. Now, like the Tasmanians, he found himself only an 
isolated valley of savages in a universe that was united in a culture 
far beyond his understanding. He'd 
never even conquered his own 
planets; all he'd done was to build 
better ways of killing himself. 

Now he was reacting typically 



20 




 



enough, in urgent need of some 
race even lower, to put him on 
middle ground, at least. He was 
substituting hatred for his lost confidence in himself. 

Why. learn more about matter 
transmitting when other races knew 
the answers and were too selfish to 
share them? Vic grumbled, remembering the experts. He'd wasted 
hours with them, to find that they 
were useless. The names that had 
been towers of strength had proved 
no more than men as baffled as he 
was. With even the limited knowledge he'd pried from Ptheela, he 
was far ahead of them — and still 
further behind the needs of the 
problem. 

THE gun Flavin had insisted he 
wear was uncomfortable, and 
he pulled himself up, staring at 
the crew of men who were working as close to the center of wind 
as they could get. He hadn't been 
able to convince them that tunneling was hopeless. All they needed 
was a one-millimeter hole through 
the flooring, up which blasting 
powder could be forced to knock 
aside the glass fragment. They refused to accept the fact that the 
Betz II shielding could resist the 
best diamond drills under full 
power for centuries. He shrugged. 
At least it helped the general 
morale to see something being 
done; he'd given in finally and let 
them have their way. 

"We might as well go back," he 



decided. He'd hoped that the morning air and sight of the station 
might dear his head, but the weight 
of responsibility had ruined that. 
It was ridiculous, but he was still 
in charge. 

Flavin reached back and cut on 
the little television set. With no 
real understanding, he was trying 
to learn tolerance of Ptheela, but 
he felt more comfortable in front, 
beside the chauffeur. 

Pat caught her breath, and Vic 
looked at the screen, where a newscast was showing a crowd in Denver tearing down one of the Earthdesigned intercity teleports. Men 
were striking back at the menace 
blindly. A man stood up from his 
seat in Congress to demand an end 
to alien intercourse; Vic remembered the fortune in interstellar 
trading of levo-rotary crystals that 
had bought the man's seat and the 
transmitter-brought drugs that had 
saved him from death by cancer. 

There were riots in California, 
the crackpot Knights of Terra were 
recruiting madly, and murder was 
on the increase. Rain had fallen in 
Nevada. There were severe weather 
disturbances throughout the country, caused by the unprecedented 
and disastrously severe low over 
Bennington. People were complaining of the air, already claiming they could feel it growing 
thinner, though that was sheer hysterical nonsense. Also, the Galactic 
Envoy was missing. 

The editorial of the Bennington 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



21 



Times came on last, pointing a finger at Vic for changing the circuits, but blaming it on the aliens 
who hoarded their knowledge so 
callously. There was just enough 
truth in the charge to be dangerous. Bennington was close enough 
to the transmitter to explain the 
undertones of lynch law that permeated the editorial. 

"Ill put a stop to that," Flavin 
told Vic angrily. "I've got enough 
pull to make them pull a complete 
retraction. But it won't undo all 
the harm." 

VIC felt the automatic, and it 
seemed less of a nuisance now. 
"I notice no news on Pan-Asia's 
ultimatum." 

"Yeah. I hear the story was 
killed by Presidential emergency 
powers, and Pan-Asia has agreed 
to a three-day stay — no more. My 
information isn't the best, but I 
gather we'll bomb it ourselves if 
it isn't cleared up by then." 

Vic climbed out at the local station office, with the others trailing. 
In the waiting room, a vaguely 
catlike male from Sardax waited, 
clutching a few broken ornaments 
and a thin sheaf of Galactic credits. One of his four arms was 
obviously broken and yellow blood 
oozed from a score of wounds. 

But he only shrugged at Vic's 
whistled questions, and his answer 
in Code was unperturbed. "No 
matter. In a few moments I ship 
to Chicago, then home. My attack


ers smclled strongly of hate, but I 
escaped." His whistle caught at a 
signal from the routing office, and 
he hurried off, with a linal sentence. "They will survive, I am 
told." 

Remembering die talons on the 
Sardaxan's hands, Vic grinned wryly. They were a peaceful race, but 
pragmatic enough to see no advantage in being killed. 

Vic threw open the door to his 
little office and the four went in. 
It wasn't until he started toward 
his desk that he noticed his visitor. 

The Galactic Envoy might have 
been the robot he claimed, but 
there was no sign of it. He was 
dressed casually in expensive 
tweeds, lounging gracefully in a 
chair, with a touch of a smile on 
his face. Now he got up, holding 
out a hand to Vic. 

"I heard you were running 
things. Haven't seen you since I 
helped pick you for the first year 
class, but I keep informed. Thought 
I'd drop by to tell you the Council 
has given official approval to your 
full authority over the Earth 
Branch of Teleport Interstellar, and 
I've filed the information with the 
U. N. and your President." 

Vic lifted his head. "Why me?" 

"You've learned all the theory 
Earth has, you've had more practical experience with more stations 
than anyone else, and you've undoubtedly picked Ptheela's brains 
dry by now. You're the obvious 
man." ,

"I'd a lot rather see one of your 
high and mighty Galactic experts 
take over!" 

The Envoy shook his head gently. "We've found that the race 
causing the trouble usually is the 
race best fitted to solve it. The same 
ingenuity that maneuvered the sabotage — it was sabotage, by the way 
— will help you solve it, perhaps. 
The Council may not care much for 
your grab first rule in economics 
and politics, but it never doubted 
that you represent one of the most 
ingenious races we have met. You 
see, there really are no inferior 
races." 

"Sabotage?" Pat looked sick. 
"Who'd be that stupid and 
vicious?" 

THE Envoy smiled faintly. 
"Who'd give the Knights of 
Terra money for a recruiting drive? 
I can't play much part in things 
here — I've got limited abilities, a 
touch of telepathy, a little more 
knowledge than you, and a certain 
in-built skill at handling political 
situations. Your own government is 
busy examining the ramifications of 
the plot now. It had to be an inside job, as you call it." 

"Earth for Earth, and down with 
the transmitters," Vic summed it 

up- . 

The Envoy nodded. "They forget 
that the transmitters can't be removed without Council workers. 
And when the Council revokes approval, it destroys all equipment 



and most books, while seeing thai 
three generations are brought up 
without knowledge. You'd rever 
to semi-savagery and have to maku 
a fresh start up. Well, I'm lucky — 
your President J^ilkes is sympathetic, and your F. B. I. has been 
cooperative so far. If you sol\ . 
things, the sabotage shouldn\ 
prove too much of a problem. Goo I 
luck." 

Flavin had been eying him, anil 
his dislike flared up as the Envoy 
left. "A hell of a lot of nerve for 
guys who claim they don't interfere !" 

"It happened to us twice," 
Ptheela observed. "We were better 
for it eventually. The. Council's 
rules are from half a billion years 
of experience, with tremendous 
knowledge. We must submit." 
."Not without a fight!" 

"Without a fight," Vic said 
bluntly. "We're babes in arms to 
them. Anyhow, who cares? Congressional babble won't save us if 
we lose our atmosphere. But they 
can't see it." 

The old idea — something would 
turn up. Maybe they couldn't cut 
off the transmitter from outside, 
and had no way of getting past the 
wind to the inside. But something 
would turn up. 

He'd heard rumors of the Army 
taking over, and almost wished 
they would. As it stood, he had 
full responsibility and nothing 
more. Flavin and the Council had 
turned thiogs over to him, but the 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



23 



local cop on the beat had more 
power. It would be a relief to have 
someone around to shout even stupid orders, and get some of the 
weight off Vic's shoulders. 

SABOTAGE! It couldn't even be 
an accident;. the cockeyed race 
to which he belonged had to try to 
commit suicide and then expect 
him to save it. 

He shook his head, vaguely conscious of someone banging on the 
door, and reached for the knob. 
"Amos!" 

The sour face never changed expression as the corpselike figure of 
the man slouched in. Amos was 
dead — he'd been in the transmitter. They all realized it at once. 

But Amos shook off their remarks. "Nothing surprising, just 
common sense. When I saw the 
capsule start cracking, I jumped 
into a capsule headed for Plathgol, 
set the delay, and tripped the 
switch. Saw some glass shooting at 
me, but I was in Plathgol before 
it hit. Went out and got me a mess 
of Isiuna — they cook fair to middling, seeing they never tried it 
before they met us. Then I showed 
'em my pass, came through Chicago, 
here, and home. I figured the old 
woman would be worried. Nobody 
told me about the mess till I saw 
the papers. Common sense to report to you, so here I am." 

"How much did you see of the 
explosion?" Pat asked. 

"Not much. Just saw it was 



cracking — trick glass, no temperature tolerance. Looked like Earth 
capsule color." 

It didn't matter. It added to 
Vic's disgust to believe it was sabotage, but didn't change the picture 
otherwise. The Council wouldn't 
reverse its decision. They treated a 
race as a unit, making no exception 
for the behavior of a few individuals, whether good or bad. 

Another knock on the door cut 
off his vicious circle of hopelessness. "Old home week here, evidently. Come in!" 

The man who entered was the 
rare example of a fat man in the 
pink of physical condition, with no 
sign of softness. He shoved his bulk 
through the doorway as if he expected the two stars on his shoulders to light the way and awe all 
beholders. "Who is Victor Peters?" 

Vic wiggled a finger at himself, 
and the general came over. He 
drew out an envelope and dropped 
it on the desk, showing clearly that 
acting as a messenger was far beneath his dignity. "An official communication from the President of 
the United States," he said mechanically, and turned to make his exit 
back to the intercity transmitters. 

It was a plain envelope, without 
benefit of wax seals or ribbons. Vic 
ripped it open, looked at the signature and the simple letterhead, and 
checked the signature again. He 
read it aloud to the others. 

"To Mr. — damn it, officially I've 
got a doctor's degree — to Mr. Vic


24 




 



tor Peters, nominally — Hah ! — in 
charge of the Bennington Branch 
of Teleport Interstellar — I guess 
they didn't tell him it's nominally 
in charge of all Earth branches. 
Umm. You are hereby instructed to 
remove all personnel from a radius 
of five miles minimum of your 
Teleport Branch not later than 
noon, August 21, unless matters 
shall be satisfactorily culminated 
prior to that time. Signed, Homer 
Wilkes, President of the United 
States of America." 

"Bombs!" Pat shuddered, while 
Vic let the message fall to the 
floor, kicking it toward the wastebasket. "The fools! The damned 
fools! Couldn't they tell him what 
would happen? Couldn't they make 
him see that it'll only make turning 
off the transmitter impossible forever?" 

Flavin shrugged, dropping unaware onto the couch beside 
Ptheela. "Maybe he had no choice. 
Either he does it or some other 
power does it." t 

Then he came to his feet, staring at Vic. "My God, that's tomorrow noon!" 

IV 

VIC looked at the clock later, 
and was surprised to see that 
it was already well into the afternoon. The others had left him, 
Ptheela last when she found there 
was no more knowledge she could 
contribute. He had one of the elec


tronic calculators plugged in beside 
him, and a table of the so-called 
Dirac functions propped up on it; 
when the press had discovered that 
Dirac had predicted some of the 
characteristics that made telcportation possible, they'd named practically everything for him. 

The wastebasket was filled, the 
result of pure futility. He shoved 
the last sheet into it, and sat there, 
pondering. There had to be a solution!. 

Man's whole philosophy was 
built' on that idea. 

But it was a philosophy that included sabotage and suicide. What 
did it matter any — 

Vic jerked his head up, shaking 
it savagely, forcing the fatigue back 
by sheer will. There was a solution. 
All he had to do was find it — before the stupidity of war politics in 
a world connected to a Galaxy-wide 
union could prevent it. 

He pulled the calculator back, 
just as Flavin came into the room. 
The man was losing weight, or else 
fatigue was creating that illusion. 
He dropped into a chair as Vic 
looked up. 

"The men evacuated from 
around the station?" Vic asked. 

Flavin nodded. "Some of the 
bright boys finally convinced them 
that they were just wasting time, 
anyhow. Besides, the thing is still 
spreading, and getting too close to 
them. Vic, the news gets worse all 
the time. Can you take it?" 

"Now what? Don't tell me 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



25 



they've changed it to tomorrow 
morning." 

"Tomorrow, hell! In two hours 
they're sending over straight blockbusters, radar-controlled all the 
way. No atomics — yet — but they're 
jumping the gun, anyhow. Some 
nut convinced Wilkes that an ordinary eight-ton job might just 
shake things enough to fracture the 
glass that's holding the short. And 
Pan-Asia is going completely wild. 
I've been talking to Wilkes. The 
people are scared silly, and they're 
pressuring for quick war." 

Vic nodded reluctantly and 
reached for the benzedrine he'd 
hoped to save for the last possible 
moment, when it might carry him 
all the way through. What difference did it make? Even if he had 
an idea, he'd be unable to use it. 

"And yet . . ." He considered it 
more carefully, trying to figure percentages. There wasn't a chance in 
a million, but they had to take 
even that one chance. It was better 
than nothing. "It might just work 
- -if they hit the right spot. I know 
where the glass is, and the layout 
of the station. But I'll need authority to direct the bombs. Flavin, 
can you get me President Wilkes?" 

TTtl-AVIN shrugged, reached for 
JL the televisor. He managed to 
get quite a way up by some form 
of code, but then it began to be a 
game of nerves and brass. Along 
his own lines, he apparently knew 
his business. In less than fifteen 



minutes, Vic was talking to the 
President. For a further few minutes, the screen remained blank. 
Then another face came on, this 
time in military uniform, asking 
quick questions, while Vic pointed 
out the proper targets. 

Finally the officer nodded. "Good 
enough, Peters. We'll try it. If you 
care to watch, you can join the 
observers. Mr. Flavin already 
knows where they are. How are the 
chances?" 

"Not good. Worth trying." 

The screen darkened again, and 
Flavin got up. The thing was a 
wild gamble, but it was better to. 
jar the building than to melt its 
almost impregnable walls. Even 
Betz II metal couldn't take a series 
of hydrogen bombs, though nothing else could hurt it. And with 
that fury, the whole station would 
go
They picked up Pat, and moved 
out to Flavin's car. Vic knew better 
than to try to bring Ptheela along. 
As, an alien, she was definitely taboo around military affairs. The 
storm had reached the city now, 
and dense clouds were pouring 
down thick gouts of rain, leaving 
the day as black as night. The car 
slogged through it, until Flavin 
opened the door and motioned them 
out into a temporary metal shelter. 

Things were already started. Remote scanners were watching the 
guided missiles come down, and 
eyes were operating in the bombs, 
working on infra-red that cut 



26 




 



through the rain and darkness. It 
seemed to move slowly on the 
screen at first, but picked up apparent speed as it approached the 
transmitter buildings. The shielding 
grew dose, and Pat drew back 
with an involuntary jerk as it hit 
and the screen went black. Dead 
center. 

But the remote scanners showed 
no change. Hie abrupt break in the 
air-motion where the transmitter 
field began, outside the shielding, 
still showed. Another bomb came 
down, and others, each spaced so 
as to hit in time for others to be 
turned back, if it worked. Even 
through the impossible tornado of 
rotating fury, it was super-precision 
bombing. 

The field went on working just 
the same, far beyond the shielding, 
pulling an impossible number of 
cubic feet of air from Earth every 
second. They stopped watching the 
screen shown by the bomb-cyes at 
last, and even the Army gave up. 

"Funny," one observer commented. "No sound, no flash when 
the bombs hit. I've been watching 
the remote scanners every time instead of the eye, and nothing 
happens. The bombs just disappear." 

PAT shook herself. "They can't 
hit. They go right through the 
field, before they can hit. Vic, it 
won't matter if we do atom-bomb 
the station. It can't be reached." 
But he was already ahead of her. 



"The Ecthindar will love that. 
They've already been dosed with 
chemical bombs. Now guess what 
they'll do." 

"Simple." It was the observer 
who got that. "Start feeding atom 
bombs into their transmitters back 
to us." 

Then he shouted hoarsely, pointing through a window. From the 
direction of the station, a dazzle of 
light had lanced out sharply, and 
was now fading down. Vic snapped 
back to the remote scanner, and 
scowled. The field was still working; there was no sign of damage 
to the transmitter. If the Ecthindar had somehow snapped a bomb 
into the station, it must have been 
retransmitted before full damage. 

The Army men stared sickly at 
the station, but Vic was already 
moving toward the door. Pat 
grabbed his arm, and Flavin was 
with them by the time they reached 
the waiting car. 

"The Bennington office," Vic 
told the driver. "Fast! Somebody 
has to sec the Ecthindar in a hurry, 
if it'll do any good." 

"I'm going, too, Vic," Pat announced. He shook his head. "I'm 
going," she repeated stubbornly. 
"Nobody knows much about 
Ecthinbal or the Ecthindar. You 
call in Code messages, get routine 
Code back. We can't go there without fancy pressure suits, because we 
can't breathe their air. And they 
never leave. But I told you I was 
interested in races, and I have been 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



27 



trying to chit-chat with them. I 
know some things. You'll need 
me." 

He shook his head again. "It's 
enough for one of us to get killed. 
If I fail, Amos can try, or Flavin. 
If they both fail — well, suit yourself. It won't matter whether they 
kill me there or send through 
bombs to kill me here. But if one 
of us can get a chance to explain, 
it may make some difference. I 
don't know. But it may." 

Her eyes were hurt, but she gave 
in, going with him silently as he 
stepped into the local Bennington 
unit and stepped out in Chicago, 
heading toward the Chicago Interstellar branch. She waited patiently 
while the controlmen scouted out a 
pressure suit for him. Then she began helping him fasten it and 
checking his oxygen equipment. 
"Come back, Vic," she said 
finally. 

HE CHUCKED a fist under her 
chin and kissed her quickly, 
keeping it casual with a sureness 
he couldn't feel. "You're a good 
kid, Pat. I'll sure try." 

He pulled the helmet down and 
clicked it shut before stepping into 
the capsule and letting the seal 
snap shut. He could see her swing 
to the interstellar phone, her lips 
pursed in whistled code. The sound 
was muffled, but the lights changed 
abruptly, and her hand hit the 
switch. 

There was no apparent time in


volved. He was on Ecthinbal, looking at a faintly greenish atmosphere, noticeable only because of 
the sudden change, and fifty pounds 
seemed to have been added to his 
weight. The transmitter was the 
usual Betz II design, and everything else was familiar except for 
the creature standing beside the 
capsule. 

The Ecthindar might have been 
a creation out of green glass, coated 
with a soft fur, and blown by a 
bottlemaker who enjoyed novelty. 
There were two thin, long legs, 
multijointed, and something that 
faintly resembled the pelvis of a. 
skeleton. Above that, two other thin 
rods ran up, with a double bulb 
where lungs might have been, and 
shoulders like the collar pads of a 
football player, joined together and 
topped by four hard knobs, each 
with a single eye and orifice. Double arms ran from each shoulder, 
almost to the ground. 

He expected to hear a tinkle 
when the creature moved, and was 
surprised when he did hear it, until 
he realized the sound was carried 
through the metal floor, not 
through the thin air. 

The creature swung open the 
capsule door after some incomprehensible process that probably 
served to sterilize it. Its Galactic 
Code whistle came through Vic's 
shoes from the floor. "We greet 
you, Earthman. Our mansions are 
poor, but they are yours. Our lives 
are at your disposal." Then the 



28 




 



formal speecli ended in a sharp 
whistle. "Literally, it would seem. 
We die." 

It didn't fit with Vic's expectations, but he tried to take his cue 
from it. "That's why I'm here. Do 
you have some kind of ruler? Umm, 
good. How do I get to see this 
ruler?" He had few hopes of getting there, but it never did any 
harm to try. 

The Ecthindar seemed unsurprised. "I shall take you at once. 
For what other purpose is a ruler 
but to serve those who wish to see 
it? But — I trespass on your kindness in the delay. But may I question whether a strange light came 
forth from your defective transmitter?" 

VIC snapped a look at it, and 
nodded slowly. 
"It did." 

Now the ax would fall. He 
braced himself for it, but the creature ceremoniously elaborated on 
his nod. 

' ' I was on e who beli eved i t 
might. It is most comforting to 
know my science was true. When 
the bombs came through, we held 
them in a shield, but, in our error, 
we believed them radioactive. We 
tried a negative aspect of space to 
counteract them. Of course, it 
failed, since they were only chemical. But I had postulated that some 
might have escaped from receiver 
to transmitter, being negative. You 
are kind. And now, if vou will 



honor my shoulder with the touch 
of your hand, so that my portableunit will transport us both . . 

Vic reached out and the scene 
shifted at once. There was no apparent transmitter, and the trick 
beat anything he had heard from 
other planets. Perhaps it was -totally unrelated to the teleport machine. 

But he had no time to ask. 

A door in the little room opened, 
and another creature came in, this 
time single from pelvis to shoulders, but otherwise the same. "The 
ruler has been requested," it whistled. "That which the ruler is is 
yours, and that which the ruler has 
is nothing. May the ruler somehow 
serve?" 

It was either the most cockeyed 
bit of naivete or the fanciest runaround Vic had found, but totally 
unlike anything he'd been prepared 
for. He gulped, and began whistling out the general situation on 
Earth. 

The Ecthindar interrupted politely. "That we know. And the converse is true— we too are dying. We 
are a planet of a thin air, and that 
little is chlorine. Now from a matter transmitter comes a great rush 
of oxygen, which we consider 
poison. Our homes around are 
burned in it, our plant life is dying 
of it, and we are forced to remain 
inside and seal ourselves off. Like 
you, we can do nothing — the wind 
from your world is beyond our 
strength." 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



"But your science . . ." 

"Is beyond yours, true. But your 
race is adaptable, and we are too 
leisurely for that virtue." 

Vic shook his head, though perhaps it made good sense. "But the 
bombs ..." 

A series of graceful gestures 
took place between the two creatures, and the ruler turned back to 
Vic. 

"The ruler had not known, of 
course. It was not important. We 
lost a few thousand people whom 
we love. We understood, however. 
There is no anger, though it 
pleases us to sec that your courtesy 
extends across the spaces to us. 
May your dead pass well." 

That was at least one good break 
in the situation. Vic felt some of 
his worry slide aside to make room 
for the rest. "And I don't suppose 
you have any ideas on how we can 
take care of this . . ." 

There was a shocked moment, 
with abrupt movements from the 
two creatures. Then something 
came up in the ruler's hands, vibrating sharply. Vic jumped back 
— and froze in mid-stride, to fall 
awkwardly onto the floor. A chunk 
of ice seemed to form in his backbone and creep along his spine, 
until it touched his brain. Death 
dr paralysis? It was all the same; 
he had air for only an hour more. 
The two creatures were fluttering 
at each other and moving toward 
him when he abruptly and painlessly blacked out. 



V 

HIS first feeling was the familiar, deadening pull of fatigue 
as his senses began to come back. 
Then he saw that he was in a tiny 
room — and that Pat lay stretched 
out beside him ! 

He threw himself up to a sitting 
position, surprised to find that there 
were no after-effects to whatever 
the ruler had used. The damned 
little fool, coming through after 
him. And now they had her, too. 

Her eyes snapped open, and she 
sat up beside him. "Darn it, I almost fell asleep waiting for you to 
revive. It's a good thing I brought 
extra oxygen flasks. Your hour is 
about up. How'd you manage to 
insult them?" 

He puzzled over it while she 
changed his oxygen flask and he 
did the same for her. "I didn't. I 
just asked whether they didn't know 
of some way we could take care of 
this trouble." 

"Which meant to them that you 
suspected they weren't giving all 
the help they could, after their formal offer when you came over. I 
convinced them it was just that you 
were still learning Code, whatever 
you said. They're nice, Vic. I never 
really believed other races were 
better than we are, but I do now — 
and it doesn't bother me at all." 

,"It'd bother Flavin. He'd have 
to prove they were sissies or something. How do we get out?" 
She pushed the door open, and 



30 




 



they stepped back into the room of 
the ruler, who was waiting for 
them. It made no reference to the 
misunderstanding, but inspected 
Vic, whistled approval of his condition, and plunged straight to 
business. 

"We have found part of a solution, Earthman. We die, but it 
will be two weeks before our end. 
First, we shall set up a transmitter 
in permanent transmit, equipped 
with a precipitator to remove our 
chlorine, and key it to another of 
your ' transmitters. Whichever one 
you wish. Ecthinbal is heavy, but 
small, and a balance will be struck 
between the air going from you and 
the air returning. The winds between stations may disturb your 
weather, but not seriously, we hope. 
That which the ruler is is yours. A 
lovely passing." 

It touched their shoulders, and 
they were back briefly in the transmitter, to be almost instantly in the 
Chicago Branch. Vic was still shaking his head. 

"It won't work. The ruler didn't 
allow for the way our gravity falls 
off faster and our air thins out 
higher up. We'd end up with maybe four pounds pressure, which 
isn't enough. So both planets die — 
two worlds on my shoulders instead of one. Hell, we couldn't take 
that offer from them, anyhow. Pat, 
how'd you convince them to let me 
go?" 

She had shucked out of the pressure suit and stood combing her 



hair. "Common sense, as Amos 
says. I figured engineers consider 
each other engineers first, and 
aliens second, so I went to the head 
engineer instead of the ruler. He 
fixed it up somehow. I guess I must 
have sounded pretty desperate, at 
that, knowing your air would give 
out after an hour." 

They went through the, local intercity teleport to Bennington and 
on into Vic's office, where Flavin 
met them with open rehef and a 
load of questions. Vic let Pat answer, while he mulled over her 
words. Somewhere, there was an 
idea — let the rulers alone and go 
to the engineers. Some obvious solution that the administrators would 
try and be unable to use? He 
shoved it around in his floating 
memory, but it refused to trigger 
any chain of thought. 

PAT was finishing the account of 
the Ecthindar offer, but Flavin 
was not impressed. Ptheela came 
in, and it had to be repeated for 
her, with much more enthusiastic 
response. 

"So what?" Flavin asked. "They 
have to die, anyhow. Sure, it's a 
shame, but we have our own problems. Hey — wait ! Maybe there's 
something to it. It'd take some guts 
and a little risk, but it would 
work." 

Flavin considered it while Vic 
sat fidgeting, willing to listen to 
any scheme. The politician took a 
cigar out and lit it carefully, his 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



31 



first since the accident; he'd felt 
that smoking somehow used up 
•air. "Look, if they work their transmitter, we end up with a quarter 
of what we need. But suppose we 
had four sources. We connect with 
several oxygen -atmosphere worlds. 
Okay, we load our transmitters with 
atom bombs, and send one capsule 
to each jvorld. After that, they 
either open a transmitter to us with 
air, or we let them have it. They 
can live — a little poorer, maybe, 
but still live. And we're fixed for 
good. Congress and the President 
would jump at it." 
"That all?" Vic asked. 

F.AVIN nodded. Vic's fist 
caught him in the mouth, 
spilling him onto the floor. The 
politician lay there, feeling his jaw 
and staring up at Vic. Then the 
anger was gone, and Vic reached 
down to -help him up. 

"You're half a decent guy and 
half a fouse," Vic told him. "You 
had that coming, but I should have 
used it on some of the real lice 
around. Besides, maybe you have 
part of an idea." 

"All right, no teeth lost — just 
the first cigar I've enjoyed in 
days." Flavin rubbed his jaw, then 
grinned ruefully. "I should have 
known how you feel. I just happen 
to believe in Earth first. What's 
this big idea of yours?" 

"Getting our air through other 
planets. Our air. It's a routing job. 
If we can set up a chain so the air 



going out of one transmitter in a 
station is balanced by air coming 
from another in the same station, 
there'd be a terrific draft. But most 
of it would be confined in the station, and there wouldn't be the 
outside whirlwind to keep us from 
getting near. Instead of a mad rush 
of air in or out of the building, 
there'd be only eddy currents outside of the inner chamber. We'd 
keep our air, and maybe have time 
to figure out some way of getting 
at that hunk of glass." 

"Won't work," Flavin ' said 
gloomily. "Suppose Wilkes was 
asked to route through for another 
planet. He'd have to turn it down. 
Too much risk." 

"That's where Pat gave me the 
tip. Engineers get used to thinking 
of each other as engineers instead 
of competing races — they have to 
work together. They have the same 
problems and develop the same 
working habits. If I were running 
a station and the idea was put to 
me, I'd hate to turn it down, and 
I might not think of the political 
end. I've always wanted to see what 
happened in continuous transmittal; 
I'll be tickled pink to get at the 
instrument rolls in the station. And 
a lot of the other engineers will 
feel the same." 

"We're already keyed to Plathgol on a second transmitter," Pat 
added. "And the Ecthindar indicated they had full operation when 
it happened, so they're keyed to 
five other planets." 



32 




 



"Bomb-dropping starts in about 
four hours," Flavin commented. 
"After that, what?" 

"No chance. They'll go straight 
through, and the Ecthindar can 
neutralize them — but one is pretty 
* sure to start blasting here and carry 
through in full action. Then there'll 
be no other transmitter in their station, just a big field on permanent 
receive." 

THE two engineers at the Chicago Branch were busy shooting dice when the four came 
through the intercity transmitter. 
There was no one else in the place, 
and no sign of activity. Word of 
the proposed bombing had leaked 
out, and the engineers had figured 
that answering bombs would come 
blasting back through Earth tcleports. They knew what they'd have 
done, and didn't know of the 
Ecthindar philosophy. The engineers had passed the word to other 
employees, and only these two 
were left, finishing a feud of long 
standing in the time left. 

"Know anything about routing?" Vic asked. When they indicated no knowledge, he chased 
them out on his Teleport Interstellar authority and took over. He 
had no need of more engineers, 
and they were cynical enough about 
the eventual chances there to leave 
gladly. Vic had never had any use 
for Chicago's manager and the 
brash young crew he'd built up; 
word shouldn't have gone beyond 



the top level. If it leaked out to 
the general public, there'd be a 
panic for miles around. 

But Chicago's routing setup was 
the best in the country; he needed 
it. Now how did he go about getting a staff trained to use it? 

"Know how to find things 
here?" Flavin asked Pat. He accepted her nod, and looked surprised at Ptheela's equally quick 
assent. Then he grinned at Vic and 
began shucking off his coat. "Okay, 
you see before you one of the best 
traffic managers that ever helped 
pull a two-bit railroad out of the 
red, before I got better offers in 
politics. I'm good. You get me the 
dope, Vic can haggle on the transmitter phones, and I'll route it." 

He was good. Vic watched him 
take over with surprise, and a 
sudden growing liking for the man. 
Flavin had probably been a lot more 
of a man, before he'd been shoved 
into politics. Maybe he'd have done 
less of drinking and picking up 
prejudices if he'd been working 
where he knew he was Joing a 
good job. Certainly he had adapted 
well enough to the present situation, and he looked happier now 
as he took over. 

Flavin's mind seemed to soak up 
all routing data at once, from a 
single look at- the complicated 
blocks of transmitter groups and 
key-ins. He jumped from step to 
step without apparent thought, and 
he had to have information only 
once before engraving it on his 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



33 



mind. It was a tough nut, since the 
stations housed six transmitters 
each, keyed to six planets — but in 
highly varied combinations; every 
world had its own group of tie-ins 
with planets, also. Routing was the 
most complicated job in the wholeproblem. 

PLATHGOL was handled by 
Ptheela, who was still in good 
standing until the Council would 
learn of her breaking the law by 
talking to Vic. There was no trouble there. But trouble soon developed. Ecthinbal had been keyed to 
only two other planets, it turned 
out. Vromatchk was completely 
cold on the idea, and flatly refused. 
Ee, the other planet, seemed difficult. 

It surprised him, because it 
didn't fit with Pat's theories of 
engineers at all. He scowled at the 
phone, then whistled again. '-'Your 
zeal is commendable. Now put an 
engineer on !" 

The answering whistle carried a 
fumbling uncertainty of obvious 
surprise. "I — how did you know? I 
gave all the right answers." 

"Sure. Right off the Engineer 
Rule Sheet posted over the transmitter. No real engineer worries 
that much about them; he has more 
things to think of. Put the engineer on." 

The answer was still obstinate. 
"My father's asleep. He's tired. Call 
later." 

The connection went dead at 



once. Vic called Ecthinbal while 
clambering into the big pressure 
suit. He threw the delay switch and 
climbed into the right capsule. A 
moment later, an Ecthindar was 
moving the capsule on a delicatelooking machine to another transmitter. Something that looked like 
a small tyrannosaurus with about 
twenty tentacles instead of forelegs 
was staring in at him a second later, 
and he knew he was on Ee. 

"Take me to the engineer!" he 
ordered. "At once!" 

The great ridges of horn over 
the eyes came down in a surprisingly human scowl, but the stubbornness was less certain in person. The 
creature turned and led Vic out to 
a huge shack outside. In answer 
to a whooping cry, a head the size 
of a medium-sized freight car came 
out of the door, to be followed by 
a titanic body. The full-grown 
adult was covered with a thick coat 
of ropy hair. 

"Where from?" the Ee engineer 
whistled. "Wait — I saw a picture 
once. Earth.. Come in. I hear you 
have quite a problem there." 

Vic nodded. It came as a shock 
to him that the creature could probably handle the whole station by 
itself, as it obviously did, and quite 
efficiently, with that size and all 
those tentacles. He stated his problem quickly. 

The Looech, as it called itself, 
scratched its stomach with a row 
of tentacles and pondered. "I'd 
like to help you. Oh, the empress 



34 




 



would have Jits, but I could call it 
an accident. We engineers aren't 
really responsible to governments, 
after all, are we? But it's the busy 
season. I'm already behind, since 
my other engineer got in a duel. 
That's why the pup was tending 
while I slept. You say the field 
spreads out on continuous transmit?.'* 

"It does, but it wouldn't much 
more if there isn't too long a period." 

"Strange. I've thought of continuous transmittal, of course, but 
I didn't suspect that. Why, I wonder?" 

VIC started to give Ptheela's explanation of unbalanced resonance between the vacuum of the 
center and the edges in contact 
with matter, but dropped it quickly. "I'll probably know better when 
I can read the results from the instruments." 

The Looech grumbled to itself. 
"You suppose you could send me 
the readings? We're about on a 
Galactic level, so it wouldn't strain 
the law too much." 

Vic shook his head. "If I can't 
complete the chain, there won't be 
any readings. I imagine you could 
install remote cut-offs fairly easily." 

"No trouble, though nobody ever 
seemed to think they might be 
needed. I suppose it would be covered under our emergency powers, 
if we stretch them a little. Oh, 
blast you, now I won't sleep for 



worrying abou t why the field 
spreads. When will you begin?" 

Vic grinned tightly as they arranged the approximate time and 
let the Looech carry him back to 
the capsule. He flashed through 
Ecthinbal, and climbed out of the 
Chicago transmitter to find Pat 
looking worriedly at the capsule, 
summoned by the untended call 
announcer. 

"You're right, Pat," he told her. 
Engjn eers run pretty much to 
form. Tell Flavin we've got Ee." 

But there were a lot of steps to 
be taken still. He ran into a -Stumbling block at Norag, and had to 
wait for a change of shift, before 
a sympathetic engineer cut the red 
tape to clear him. And negative 
decisions here and there kept Flavin 
jumping to find new routes. 

They almost made it, to find a 
decision had just been reversed on 
Seloo by some authority who had 
gotten word of the deal. That meant 
that other authorities would probably be called in, with more reverses, in time. Once operating, the 
engineers could laugh at authority, 
since the remote cut-off could be 
easily hidden. But time was running out. There were only twentyseven minutes left before the bombs 
dropped, and it would take fifteen to countermand their being 
dropped. 

"Give me that," Flavin ordered, 
grabbing the phone. "There are 
times when it takes executives instead of engineers. We're broken at 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



35 



Scloo. Okay, we don't know where 
Scloo ships." His Galactic Code was 
halting, but fairly effective. The 
mechanical chirps from the Seloo 
operator leaped to sudden haste. A 
short pause was followed by an 
argument Vic was too tired to 
catch, until the final sentence. 
"Enad to Brjd to Teeni clear." 

"Never heard of Brjd," he commented. 

Flavin managed a ghost of a 
swagger. "Figured our lists were 
only partial, and wc could stfr up 
another link. Here's the list. I'll 
get Wilkes. Now that we've got it, 
he'll hold off until we see how it 
works." 

It was a maze, but the list was 
complete, from Earth to Ecthinbal, 
Ee, Petzby, Norag, Szpendrknopalavotschel, Seloo, Enad, Brjd, Teeni, 
and finally through Plathgol to 
Earth. Vic w histled the given signal, 
and the acknowledgments came 
through. It was in operation. 
Flavin's nod indicated Wilkes had 
confirmed it and held off the bombs. 

Nothing was certain, still; it 
might or might not do the trick. 
But the tension dropped somewhat. 
Flavin was completely exhausted. 
He hadn't had decent exercise for 
years, and running from communications to routing had been almost 
continual. He flopped over on a 
shipping table. Ptheela bent over 
him and began massaging him deftly. He grumbled, but gave in, then 
sighed gratefully. 

"Where'd you learn that?" 



She managed an Earthly giggle. 
"Instinct. My ancestors were plants 
that caught animals for food. We 
had all manner of ways to entice 
them— not just odor and looks. I 
can sense exactly how your body 
feels in the back of my head. Mm, 
delicious!" 

HE STRUGGLED at that, his 
face changing color. Her arms 
moved slowly, and he relaxed. 
Finally he reached for a cigar. "I'll 
have nightmares, I'll bet, but it's 
worth it. Oh, oh! Trouble!" 

The communicators were chirping busily. 

"Some of the rulers must be 
catching on and don't like it," 
Ptheela guessed. 

To Vic's surprise, though, several 
did like it, and were simply sending along hopes for success. Etchinbal's message was short, but it tingled along Vic's nerves: "It is good 
to have friends." 

Bennington was reporting by 
normal televisor contact, but while 
things seemed to be improving, they 
still couldn't get near enough to be 
sure. The field was apparently collapsing as the air was fed inside 
it, though very slowly. 

Ptheela needed no sleep, while 
Flavin was already snoring. Pat 
shook her head as Vic started to 
pull himself up on a table. She 
led him outside to the back of one 
of the sheds, where a blanket covered a cot, apparently used by one 
of the supervisors. She pushed him 



36 




 



toward it, As he started to struggle 
at the idea of using the only soft 
bed, she dropped onto it herself and 
pulled him down. 

"Don't be silly, Vic. It's big 
enough for both, and it's better 
than those tables." 

It felt like pure heaven, narrow 
though it was. Beside him, Pat 
stirred restlessly. He rolled over, 
pulling himself closer to her, off the 
hard edge of the cot, his arm over 
and around her. 

For a moment, he thought she 
was protesting, but she merely 
turned oyer to face him, settling his 
arm back. In the half-light, her 
eyes met his, wide and serious. Her 
lips trembled briefly under his, then 
clung firmly. His own responded, 
reaching for the comfort and end 
of tension hers could bring. 

"I'm glad it's you, Vic," she told 
him softly. Then her eyes closed as 
he started to answer, and his own 
words disappeared into a soft fog 
of sleep. 

The harsh rasp of a buzzer woke 
him, while a light blinked on and 
off near his head. He shook some 
of the sleep confusion out of his 
thoughts, and made out an intercom box. Flavin's voice came over 
It harshly and he flipped the switch. 

"Vic, where the hell are you? 
Never mind. Wilkes just woke me 
up with a call. Vic, it*s helped, but 
not enough. The field is about even 
with the building now. It's stopped 
shrinking, but we're still losing air. 
There's too much loss at Ecthinbal 



and at Ee — the engineer there 
didn't get the portals capped right, 
and Ecthinbal can't do anything. 
We're getting about one-third of 
our air back. And Wilkes can't hold 
the pressure for bombing much 
longer! Get over here." 

VI 

"TT7HERFS Ptheela?" Vic 
V V asked as he came into the 
transmitter room. She needed no 
sleep, and should have taken care 
of things. 

"Gone. Back to Plathgol, I 
guess, ' ' Flavin said bitterly, ' 'She 
was flicking out as 1 woke up. Rats 
deserting the sinking ship — though 
I was starting to figure her different. It just shows you can't trust a 
plant." 

Vic swept his attention to the 
communicator panel. The phones 
were still busy. They were still 
patient. Even the doubtful ones 
were now accepting things; but it 
couldn't last forever. Even without 
the risk, the transmitter banks were 
needed for regular use. Many did 
not have inexhaustible power 
sources, either. 

A new note cut in over the whistling now, and he turned to the 
Plathgol phone, wondering whether 
it was Ptheela and what she wanted. The words were English, but 
the voice was strange. 

"Plathgol calling. This is 
Thlegaa, Wife of Twelve Husbands, Supreme Plathgol Teleport 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



Engineer, Ruler of the Council of 
United Plathgol, and hereditary 
goddess, if you want the whole 
letterhead. Pthcela just gave me the 
bad news. Why didn't you call on 
us before — or isn't our air good 
enough for you?" 

"Hell, do you all. speak English?" Vic asked, too surprised to 
care whether he censored his 
thoughts. "Your air always smelled 
good to me. Are you serious?" 

The chuckle this time wasn't a 
mere imitation. Thlegaa had her 
intonation down exactly. "Sonny, 
up here we speak whatever our cultural neighbors do. You should 
hear my French nasals and Vro* 
matchkan rough-breathings. And 
I'm absolutely serious about the 
offer. We're pulling the stops off 
the transmitter housing. We run a 
trifle higher pressure than you, so 
we'll probably make up the whole 
loss. But I'm not an absolute ruler, 
so it might be a good idea to speed 
things up. You can thank me later. 
Oh — Pthcela's j ust been banned 
for giving you illegal data. She 
con f essed . When you get your 
Bennington plant working, she'll 
probably be your first load from us. 
She's packing up now." 

Flavin's face held too much relief. Vic hated to disillusion the 
politician as he babbled happily 
about always knowing the PlathgoIians were swell people. But Vic 
knew the job was a long way from 
solved. With Plathgol supplying 
air, the field would collapse back 



to the inside of the single transmitter housing, and there should be 
an even balance of ingoing and 
outcoming air, which would end 
the rush of air into the station, and 
make the circular halls passable, except for eddy currents. But getting 
into the inner chamber, where the 
air formed a gale between the two 
transmitters, was another matter. 

TTTLAVIN'S chauffeur was asleep 
A at the wheel of the car as they 
came out of the Bennington local 
office, yet instinct seemed to rouse 
him, and the car cut off wildly for 
the station. Vic had noticed that 
the cloud around it was gone, and 
a mass of people was grouped nearby. The wind that had been sucked 
in and around it to prevent even a 
tank getting through was gone now, 
though the atmosphere would 
probably show signs of it in freak 
weather reports for weeks after. 

Pat had obviously figured out the 
trouble remaining. And didn't look 
too surprised at the gloomy faces 
of the transmitter crew who were 
grouped near the north entrance. 
But she began swearing under her 
breath, as methodically and levelly 
as a man. Vic was ripping his shirt 
off as they drew up. 

"This time you stay out," he told 
her. "It's strictly a matter of muscle 
power against wind resistance, and 
a man has a woman beat there." 

"Why do you think I was curs-' 
ing?" she asked. "Take it easy, 
though." 



33 




 



The men opened a way for him. 
He stripped to his briefs, and let 
them smear him with oil to cut 
down air resistance a final fraction. 
Eddy currents caught at him before 
he went in, but not too strongly. 
Getting past the first shielding 
wasn't too bad. He found the second entrance . port through the 
middle shield, and snapped a chain 
around his waist. 

Then the full picture of what 
must have happened on Plathgol 
hit him. Chains wouldn't hav*e 
helped when they pulled off the 
coverings from the entrances, the 
su d d en rush of ai r must have 
crushed their lungs and broken 
their bones, no matter what was 
done. Imagine volunteering for sure 
death to help another world ! He 
had to make good on his part. 

He got to the inner portal, but 
the eddies there were too strong 
to go farther. Even sticking his 
eyes beyond the edge almost caught 
him into the blast between the two 
transmitters. Then he was clawing 
his way out again. 

Amos met him, shaking a 
gloomy head. "Never make it, 
Vic. Common sense. I've been 
there three times with no luck. And 
the way that draft blows, it'd knock 
even a tractor plumb out of the 
way before it could reach that hunk 
of glass." 

Vic nodded. The tanks would 
take too long to arrive, anyhow, 
though it would be a good idea to 
have them called. He yelled to 



Flavin, who came over on the run, 
while Vic was making sure that the 
little regular office building still 
stood. 

' 'Order the tanks, if we need 
them," he suggested. "Get me a 
rifle, some hard-nosed bullets, an 
all-angle vise big enough to clamp 
on a three-inch edge, and two of 
those midget telesets for use between house and field. Quick I" 

Amos stared at him, puzzled, but 
Flavin's car was already roaring toward Bennington, with a couple of 
cops leading the way with open 
sirens. Flavin was back with everything in twenty minutes, and Vic 
selected two of the strongest, leanest-looking men to come with him, 
while Pat went down to set the 
midget pickup in front of the stilloperating televisor between the 
transmitter chamber and the little 
office. Vic picked up the receiver 
and handed the rest of the equipment to the other two. 

IT WAS sheer torture fighting 
back to the inner entrance port, 
but they made it, and the other 
two helped to brace him with the 
chain while he clamped the vise to 
the edge of the portal, and locked 
the rifle into it, somehow fighting 
it into place. In the rather ill-defined picture on the tiny set's 
screen, he could see the huge fragment of glass, out of line from 
either entrance, between two covering uprights. He could just see 
the rifle barrel also. The picture 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



lost detail in being transmitted to 
the little office and picked up from 
the screen for rctransmittal bade 
to him, but it would have to do. 

The rifle was loaded to capacity 
with fourteen cartridges. He lined 
it up as best he could and tightened 
the vise, before pulling the trigger. 
The bullet ricocheted from the 
inner shield and headed toward the 
glass — but it missed by a good 
three feet. 

He was close on the fifth try, 
not over four inches off. But clinging to the edge while he pulled 
the trigger was getting harder, and 
the wind velocity inside was tossing the bullets off course. 

He left the setting, fired four 
more shots in succession before he 
had to stop to rest. They were all 
close, but scattered. That could 
keep up all day, seemingly. 

He pulled himself up again and 
squeezed the trigger. There was no 
sound over the roar of the wind — 



i 




 




and then there was suddenly a 
sound, as if the gale in there had 
stopped to cough. 

A blast of air struck, picking all 
three men up and tossing them 
against the wall. He'd forgotten the 
lag before the incoming air could 
be cut! It could be as fatal as the 
inrush alone. 

But the gale was dying as he hit 
the wall. His flesh was bruised 
from the shock, but it wasn't serious. Plathgol had managed to 
make their remote control cut out 
almost to the micro-second of the 
time when the flow to them had 
stopped, or the first pressure released — and transmitter waves were 
supposed to be instantaneous. 

He tasted the feeling of triumph 
as he crawled painfully back. With 
this transmitter off and the others 
remote controlled, the whole battle 
was over. Ecthinbal had keyed out 
automatically when Earth stopped 
sending. From now on, every transmitter would have a full set of remote controls, so the trouble could 
never happen again. 

He staggered out, unhooking the 
chain, while workmen went rushing in. Pat came through the 
crowd, with a towel and a pair of 
pants, and began wiping the oil 
off him while he tried to dress. 
Her grin was a bit shaky. He knew 
it must have looked bad when the 
final counterblast whipped out. 

Amos looked up glumly, and Vic 
grinned at him. "All over, Amos." 

The man nodded, staring at the 



THE WIND BETWEEN THE WORLDS 



41 



workmen who were dragging out 
the great pieces of glass from the 
building. His voice was strained, 
unnatural. "Yeah. Common sense 
solution, Vic." 

THEN his eyes swung aside and 
his face hardened. Vic saw the 
Envoy shoving through, with two 
wiry men behind him. The Envoy 
nodded at Vic, but his words were 
addressed to Amos. "And it shouldhave been common sense that 
you'd be caught, Amos. These men 
arc from your F. B. I. They have 
the men who paid you, and I suppose the glass will prove that it 
was a normal capsule, simply 
shocked with superhot spray and 
overdosed with supersonics. Didn't 
you realize that your easy escape to 
Plamgol was suspicious?" 

Pat had come up; her voice was 
unbelieving. "Amos!" 

Amos swung back then. "Yeah, 
Pat. I'd do it agai n , an d maybe 
even without the money. You think 
I like these God damned animals 
and plants acting so uppity? I liked 
it good enough before they came. 
Maybe I didn't get rid of them, but 
I sure came close." 

The two men were leading him 
away as he finished, and Pat stared 
after him, tears in her eyes. 

The Envoy broke in. "He'll get 
a regular trial in your country. It 
looks better for (he local governments to handle these things. But 
I'll see if he can't get a lighter sentence than the men who hired him. 



You did a good job, Vic — you 
and Pat and Flavin. You proved 
that Earth can cooperate with other 
worlds. That is the part that impresses the Council as no other solution could have. Your world and 
Plathgol have already been accepted 
officially as full members of the 
Council now, under Ecthinbal's 
tutelage. We're a little easier about 
passing information and knowledge 
to planets that have passed the test. 
But you'll hear all that in the announcement over the network tonight. I'll see you again. I'm sure 
of that." 

He was gone, barely in time to 
dear space for Ptheela, as she 
came trooping up with eight thin, 
wispy versions of herself in tow. 
She chuckled. "They promoted me 
before they banished me, Pat. Meet 
my eight strong husbands. Now I'll 
have the strongest seed on all 
Earth. Oh, I almost forgot. A present for you and Vic." 

Then she was gone, leading her 
husbands toward Flavin's car, while 
Vic stared down at a particularly 
ugly tsiuna in Pat's hands. He 
twisted his mouth resignedly. 

"All right, I'll learn to eat the 
stuff," he told her. "I suppose I'll 
have to get used to it. Pat, will you 
marry me?" 

She dropped the tsiuna as she 
came to him, her lips reaching up 
for his. It wasn't until a month 
later that he found tsiuna tasted 
better than chicken.

primary purpose of entertainment. 
This, of course, will appeal to a 
few million people who would not 
look at a documentary film — on 
missiles or other things — even if 
admission were free. In this case, 
the fact that it is not principally a 
documentary tilm carries an almost 
unsuspected advantage. Being "fiction," it does not have to stick 
strictly to the things which have 
been done, but, like a science fiction story, it can look ahead a bit 
toward possible application. 

Though the underlying problem 
js a military one, the film story is 
devoted partly to a human problem, 
partly to what might be called 
"story line." The latter consists of 
the efforts of a submarine skipper 
and his crew to get around, and 
especially ahead of, the guided 
missiles instruction courses they are 
subjected to at Point Mugu. They 
thought they could pick up a few 
missiles and experiment with them, 
preferably aboard their own submarine. Instead, they have to learn 
about the various types of missiles, 
how they arc tested, how they work, 
the theory behind guiding, etc., etc. 
So they "obtain" without being detected — they think — the parts which 
make a launching rack for a 
missile, and put it together, only 
to discover in the end that no 
missiles happen to be available and 
that one cannot get around Navy 
Channels but has to go through 
them. 

The other story, the human prob


lem, is hinged around an accident 
which kills one of the crew and 
injures the skipper, paralyzing his 
legs. He does not recover because 
he does not want to recover; it 
needs the combined efforts of his 
superiors, his girl and, most important, the sight of his ship to make 
him capable of going back to the 
job he started. 

PERSONALLY, I was, needless 
to say, mostly interested in the 
underlying military problem, which 
is an actual one. Also an acute one, 
created not so much by the "guided" missile, which, to the untrained 
mind, is particularly dangerous because it can be aimed — but the sheer 
existence of any long-range missile, 
at all. 

Only ten years ago, there was 
still some simplicity left in naval 
warfare. Unless an enemy aircraft 
carrier was around, a shore installation was safe from attack as long 
as the enemy warships were more 
than 10 miles away — 20 miles in 
the case of a heavy battlewagon. 
The safety was, actually, far greater 
than that because the number of 
both heavy battleships and large 
aircraft carriers of any enemy is 
restricted and their movements are 
carefully checked and known. 

Here a factor came in which is 
rarely mentioned except, maybe, in 
courses at the War College. That 
is the relationship between striking 
range on the one side and detecting range on the other. For some 




 



With four jato takeoff units, the Loon, improved version of 
V-l, needs a launching ramp only slightly longer than Itself 



time a battleship had a longer 
striking range than its intended victim had detecting range. In other 
words, the ship could shoot over a 
longer distance than it could be 
seen. 

In reality, that fact may never 
have made a difference, but it is 
important now. 

Striking range in both naval and 
land warfare fell far below detecting range in the First World War, 
when aircraft was employed for 
observation purposes. But visual 
detection, whether from the lookout of a ship or from the cockpit 
of an airplane, is still hampered by 
weather. Much could go on under 
the cover of fog or rain which 
would not have gone undetected in 
fine weather. 

This is one of the reasons why 
the submarine, although a highly 
vulnerable type of vessel, became 
so important through two wars. 
The striking range of a submarine 
is short; its guns carry, on the average, hardly more than six miles. 
That is also the maximum range of 



a naval torpedo, but you rarely hit 
anything which is more than 2,000 
yards away. But the submarine had 
the enormous advantage of being 
able to approach unseen. Long and 
sad statistics prove that the striking 
range of a submarine, though short, 
was still longer than the victim's 
detection range. 

That changed decisively during 
the latter part of World War II. 
Just how it was done is still undisclosed, but it is no secret that the 
detecting devices work. I may add 
that, in theory, a submarine should 
not go undetected at all, even 
though radar waves are stopped by 
the water's surface. In theory the 
case is that we have a large body of 
a homogeneous liquid (sea water) 
with a n on -homogeneous foreign 
body (the submarine) in it. There 
should be a physical principle 
which betrays both existence and 
location of that body, even if no 
engine makes a sound, no detectable amount of heat is radiated and 
every member of the crew holds 
his breath. 



MISSILES OVER THE SEA

THE basic idea of the movie is 
built on this complex of facts. 
An "enemy" carrier, equipped with 
V-2 type long range rockets with 
atomic warheads, is approaching 
the coast. The carrier is far below 
the horizon, hence far out of radar 
range, since radar waves, naturally, 
do not follow the curvature of the 
earth. But the coast is within range 
of the carrier's missiles. (Actual 
range for a V-2 is 190 miles; 
missiles for twice that range can 
no doubt be built.) The only possible defense consists of sinking or 
at least seriously crippling the 
carrier before it can fire the rockets. 
That job is entrusted to submarines 
which arc- to torpedo the carrier. 
But the detection range of the 



carrier with its accompanying destroyers is far greater than the 
striking range of the subs. None of 
them can come close enough to 
strike. Which makes a frustrated 
submarine skipper wish he could 
fire missiles, too, so that he can 
strike from outside the detecting 
range. 

Of course the missile suited for 
submarines as they now exist is not 
the V-2 type of liquid fuel rockets, 
but the V-l type of flying bomb. 

To keep the facts straight, I 
have to mention here that the 
U. S. Navy has actually test-fired a 
V-2 rocket from the flight deck of 
a carrier (the Midway) and that 
numerous small Aerobee high altitude rockets and one large Viking 




Loon, prior to test firing at Navy's Guided Missile Center 
at Point Mugu, Cal.; the four Jato takeoff units show here 


 



rocket were fired from the converted former seaplane tender U.S.S. 
Norton Sound. The V-2 happened 
to explode soon after takeoff, but 
the Viking reached a peak altitude 
of 106 miles. If it had been fired 
for range, it would have been 
around 210 miles. The Navy has 
also fired a V-l type missile, the 
£00*j from the deck of a submarine. 

Now the difference between a 
V-2 type long range rocket and a 
V-l type Loon goes far deeper than 
the fact that one is rocket-propelled 
while the other has a simple pulscjet engine. It also goes deeper than 
the otherwise very important fact 
that a V-2 takes around 18,000 
man hours to make and a V-l only 
about 1,000 man hours. 

The essential difference between 
the two is that the V-2 rocket 
travels along a trajectory like an 
artillery projectile, while the V-l 
type has a flight path like an airplane. One may say that the V-l 
type relies on the existence of the 
atmosphere for motion, whereas 
the rocket moves in spite of the existence of the atmosphere. Those 
missiles which rely on the atmosphere have come to be called 
"cruising missiles." The V-2 
rockets should logically be referred to as "trajectory missiles." 

THE trajectory missiles are more 
expensive by far. They require 
the use of fuels that are not easy 
to handle. But once they have lifted 



off the firing table, there is nothing 
the victim can do but watch them 
in his radar screen and wonder 
where they'll hit. It is, by the use 
of counter-missiles, not completely 
impossible to knock a trajectory 
missile off its trajectory, but it is, 
even in theory, an exceedingly difficult procedure. 

The cruising missile, on the 
other hand, is interceptible. It can 
be shot down like an airplane by 
anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft 
rockets. It can be intercepted by 
fighter planes, which some British 
Spitfire pilots did on occasion without firing a shot. They flew alongside, got their wingtip under the 
wingtip of the missile, and flipped 
it over. The piloted plane could 
easily recover from that maneuver, 
but the missile crashed. Finally, the 
cruising missile can be caught by 
the steel cables of barrage balloons. 

Just how interceptible a cruising 
missile is can be shown with a few 
figures from the report which the 
commanding officer of London's air 
defense, Air Marshal Sir Roderic 
Hill, drew up after the Second 
World War, and which was published as a supplement of the 
official London Gazette (Oct. 19, 
1948). All in all, it is known from 
German records, the Germans fired 
8,070 flying bombs (V-l) against 
London. Of these, a number 
crashed soon after takeoff or strayed 
off course. A total of 7,488 was reported over England: 3,957 of 
them were brought down (1,847 by 



MISSILES OVER THE SEA 



47 




Actual takeoff of a Loon from the deck of a U. S. submarine; 
the dense white smoke is that of the solid fuel Jato units 



fighters, 1,878 by guns, 232 by 
balloons); 1,111 fell outside the 
London target area, which was 
reached by 2,420 missiles. 

But these figures are very misleading in one respect. They are 
overall figures, which include the 
early period when defending guns 
and defending fighters got into each 
other's territory and hair, and when 
the anti-aircraft equipment on the 
ground was not the best available. 
(No VT fuzes and M-9 gun directors at first.) 

The statistics make more sense 
when drawn up for the various 
phases of attack and defense during the "Robot Blitz." During the 
first phase, 42.3 per cent of the 
flying bombs reported were brought 
down; then, after reorganization of 
defense, 58.6 per cent. During the 



second phase of the attack, the percentage of bombs brought down 
climbed to 63.2, and, during the 
third phase, to 72.8. 

Quite bad from the point of view 
of the attacker. 

BUT this represented the use of 
cruising missiles in land warfare, with a fixed target (London), 
which did not move, and fixed 
launching installations, the location 
of which was reasonably well 
known and the direction of which 
was precisely known. And when 
you fire a cruising missile over 
land, there may be defending antiaircraft batteries, airports for interceptor squadrons, installations for 
counter-missiles, and whatever else 
may be developed, on every square 
mile. 



43 




 



When you fire a cruising missile 
over water, there has to be a ship 
first to do some intercepting. Furthermore, since the ship-mounted 
firing platform is not fixed, it will 
be at an uncertain (and changing) 
distance and direction. If mounted 
on a submarine, the firing platform 
can even appear and disappear. 

All of which shows why the 
Army is especially interested in 
trajectory missiles, while the Navy 
is paying much' attention to cruising missiles. And ever since the 
V-l was "naturalized," given its 
American citizenship papers, so to 
speak, it has been improved, too. 

The original German type 
needed a launching platform about 
150 feet long; the pilots of the 
RAF called them "ski sites" because of their appearance. The 
reason was that the pulse-jet engine 
can work when at rest, but does 
not deliver any useful thrust. In 
order to deliver useful thrust, it 
has to move with a speed of at 
least 150 miles per hour. 

The Germans accomplished that 
by furnishing the takeoff ramp with 
a slotted tube. Inside the tube there 
was a piston with a projection 
reaching through the slot and hooking into the belly of the missile. 
The piston was pushed by the rapid 
decomposition of concentrated 
hydrogen peroxide, producing 
steam. The original V-l, after it 
had lifted off, accelerated to around 
360 miles per hour and carried fuel 
for an average trip of 150 miles. 



Overall length of the missile was 
25 Vz feet, wing span about 17 Vz 
feet. 

An installation like one of the 
original "ski sites" would be terribly cumbersome on shipboard and 
would also need a large ship to 
accommodate it. But the Navy has 
learned to do without such a long 
takeoff ramp. As a matter of fact, 
it uses ramps only slightly longer 
than the missiles themselves! 

THE necessary acceleration is now 
supplied by four Jato solidfuel takeoff units, attached to the 
cross bar of a T-shaped structure 
on which the missile rests. When 
the Jato units have supplied the 
initial impetus and the Loon moves 
under its own power, the attachment simply drops off. 

The dimensions of the Loon are 
still roughly the same as those of 
the original V-l, but the range has 
been somewhat increased. And the 
speed seems to be higher by about 
10 per cent, which makes hitting a 
missile in flight somewhat more 
difficult when you fire from below. 
At the film's combat test in the 
Pacific, a submarine-launched Loon 
flew through the flak thrown up 
by a long string of assorted war 
vessels. Accident, of course, but 
one which tends to point out the 
difference between a missile over 
land and a missile over the sea. 

Suddenly, as a result, the submarine has a striking range of over 
150 miles. But the radar detection 



MISSILES OVER THE SEA 



49 



range is still the horizon, even 
though it is the horizon as seen 
from the height of the radar antenna. And the range of the most 
highly developed submarine detector is riot apt to be longer than 
that; most likely, it will be shorter. 
The submarine, therefore, can fire 
some 15 times as far as its detection range, unless aerial reconnaissance is complete and effective. 
Likewise, the striking range of a 
big ship, equipped for trajectory 
missiles, has gone up to 15 or 20 
times the probable detection range 
— reliable radar detection, I mean, 
which is not influenced by fog, 
storm, sleet, rain or moonless night. 

Of course this, too, works both 
ways. 

The film shows this by repeating the war-game setup of the 
opening scenes. Again there is an 
"enemy" carrier with trajectory 
missiles approaching the coast. 
Again the defending (and 
submerged) submarines are handicapped by the discrepancy between 
their striking range and the carrier's 
detection range. 

But now there is another group 
of missile-carrying submarines. Being merely converted for this purpose and not designed as missile 
subs in the first place, they cannot 
submerge as long as they have their 
missiles on deck, or, at least, not 
without ruining the missiles. But 
they are far out of detection range 
and their presence is, so far, unsuspected by the carrier. 



And the carrier is well within 
striking range of the missiles . . . 

DURING the Second World 
War, the Gernttns had a 
small missile, the Hcnschel Hs-293, 
resembling, more or less, a goodsized model airplane. It was carried 
under the wing of a fighter plane 
and launched against Allied merchantmen. It was propelled by a 
rocket unit and guided by radio 
from the launching plane. 

Of course, everybody was well 
inside everybody else's detection 
range, and the striking ranges were 
almost evenly matched. For that 
reason, the planes had to operate 
from a distance which was at the 
ext reme limit of eff ec t i veness. 
Hence they missed as often as not, 
yet they did account for a number 
of our ships. (We had a quite 
similar missile, the Bat, in the Pacific.) As became known from captured plans, the Germans were 
about to improve the performance 
of this missile by putting a television receiver into the nose. 

The end of the war prevented 
them from finishing that logical 
development, and the missile may 
have been too .small to be really 
effective, in any case. 

But a missile like the Loon definitely is not, and we have both the 
time and the technology to perfect 
it. The ingenuity, too, as The Flying Missile amply demonstrates. 

When I watched the film in a 
private showing, it was, naturally, 




 



Difficult to hit, a Loon flies through heavy flak thrown up by 
U. S. warships during naval war games held in the Pacific 



with the eyes of an engineer who 
his worked with rockets, both in 
theory and in practice, for almost 
two and a half decades. There is, 
in other words, little of novelty in 
them for me, though The Flying 
Missile did reveal certain facts that 
had been restricted until now and 
in which I found considerable professional interest. 

But if I had seen it 25 years 
ago, when rocketry still existed only 
irt arid equations on paper, when 
its supporters were regarded as 
mental defectives and the moon 
seemed centuries away . . . 



I think I would have seen it 
every day for a month. 

The middle-aged taxpayer, seeing The Flying Missile, is likely to 
reflect that there is very positively 
something being done with his 
money at Point Mugu. Others who 
are still far from being middleaged, no matter what their years 
total, will feel the thrill of seeing 
a dream of science fiction that is 
solid reality now. And I suspect 
the film may initiate careers that 
might have been different. 

Mine would not have been.

THE OTHER NOW 




By MURRAY LEINSTER 



He knew his wife was dead, because he'd seen her buried. 
But it was only one possibility out of infinitely many! 



IT WAS self-evident nonsense. 
If Jimmy Patterson had told 
anybody but Hayncs, calm men 
in white jackets would have taken 
him away for psychiatric treatment 
which undoubtedly would have 
been effective. He'd have been restored to sanity and common sense, 
and he'd probably have died of it. 
So to anyone who liked Jimmy and 
Jane, it is good that things worked 
out as they did. The facts are patently impossible, but they are satisfying. 

Haynes, though, would like 
very much to know exactly why it 



happened in the case of Jimmy and 
Jane and nobody else. There must 
have been some specific reason, but 
there's absolutely no clue to it. 

It began about three months 
after Jane was killed in that freak 
accident. Jimmy had faken her death 
hard. This night .seemed no different from any other. He came home 
just as usual and his throat tightened a little, just as usual, as he 
went up to the door. It was still 
intolerable to know that Jane 
wouldn't be waiting for him. 

The hurt in his throat was a 
familiar sensation which he was

THE OTHER NOW

doggedly hoping would go away. 
But it was extra strong tonight and 
lie wondered rather desperately if 
he'd sleep, or, if he did, whether 
lie would dream. Sometimes he had 
dreams of Jane and was happy un;il he woke up, and then he wanted 
to cut his throat. But he wasn't at 
that point tonight. Not yet. 

As he explained it to Haynes 
later, he simply put his key in the 
door and opened it and started to 
walk in. But he kicked the door 
instead, so he absently put his key 
in the door and opened it and started to walk in — 

Yes, that is what happened. He 
was half-way through before he 
realized. He stared blankly. The 
J.oor looked perfectly normal. He 
closed it behind him, feeling queer. 
He tried to reason out what had 
happened. 

Then he felt a slight draught. 
The door wasn't shut. It was wide 
open. He had to close it again. 

That was all that happened to 
mark this night off from any other, 
and there is no explanation why 
it happened — began, rather — this 
night instead of another. Jimmy 
went to bed with a taut feeling. 
He'd had the conviction that he 
opened the door twice. The same 
door. Then he'd had the conviction 
.hat he had had to close it twice. 
He'd heard of that feeling. Queer, 
but no doubt commonplace. 

He slept, blessedly without 
dreams. He woke next morning and 
found his muscles tense. That was 



an acquired habit. Before he opened 
his eyes, every morning, he reminded himself that Jane wasn't beside 
him. It was necessary. If he forgot 
and turned contentedly— to emptiness — the ache of being alive, when 
Jane wasn't, was unbearable. 

THIS morning he lay with his 
eyes closed to remind himself, 
and instead found himself thinking about that business of the door. 
He'd kicked the door between the 
two openings, so it wasn't only an 
illusion of repetition. He was 
puzzling over that repetition after 
closing the door, when he found 
he had to close it again. That 
proved to him it wasn't a standard 
mental vagary. It looked like a delusion. But his memory insisted that 
it had happened that way, whether 
it was possible or not. 

Frowning, he went out and got 
his breakfast at a restaurant and 
rode to work. Work was blessed, 
because he had to think about it. 
The main trouble was that sometimes something turned up which 
Jane would have been amused to 
hear, and he had to remind himself that there was no use making 
a mental note to tell her. Jane was 
dead. 

Today he thought a good deal 
about the door, but when he went 
home he knew that he was going 
to have a black night. He wouldn't 
sleep, and oblivion would seem infinitely tempting, because the ache 
of being alive, when Jane wasn't, 



54 




 



was horribly tedious and he could 
not imagine an end to it. Tonight 
would be a very bad one, indeed. 

He opened the door and started 
in. He went crashing into the door. 
He stood still for an instant, and 
then fumbled for the lock. But the 
door was open. He'd opened it. 
There hadn't been anything for him 
to run into. Yet his forehead hurt 
where he'd bumped into the door 
which wasn't closed at all. 

There was nothing he could do 
about it, though. He went in. He 
hung up his coat. He sat down 
wearily. He filled his pipe and grimly faced a night that was going to 
be one of the worst. He struck a 
match and lighted his pipe, and 
put the match in an ashtray. And 
he glanced in the tray. There were 
the stubs of cigarets in it. Jane's 
brand. Freshly smoked. 

He touched them with his fingers. They were real. Then a furious 
anger filled him. Maybe the cleaning woman had had the intolerable 
insolence to smoke Jane's cigarets. 
He got up and stormed through 
the house, raging as he searched 
for signs of further impertinence. 
He found none. He came back, 
seething, to his chair. The ashtray 
was empty. And there'd been nobody around to empty it. 

It was logical to question his own 
sanity, and the question gave him 
a sort of grim cheer. The matter of 
the recurrent oddities could be used 
to fight the abysmal depression 
ahead. He tried to reason them out, 



and always they added up to delusions only. 

But he kept his mind resolutely 
on the problem. Work, during the 
day, was a godsend. Sometimes hewas able to thrust aside for whole 
half-hours the fact that Jane was 
dead. Now he grappled relicvedly 
with the question of his sanity or 
lunacy. He went to the desk whercJane had kept her household accounts. He'd set the whole thing 
down on paper and examine it 
methodically, checking this item 
against that. 

JANE'S diary lay on the deskblotter, with a pencil between 
two of its pages. He picked it up 
with a tug of dread. Some day hemight read it — an absurd chronicleJane had never offered him — but 
not now. Not now! 

That was when he realized that it 
shouldn't be here. His hands 
jumped, and it fell open. He saw 
Jane's angular writing and it hurt. 
He closed it quickly, aching all 
over. But the printed date at the 
top of the page registered on his 
brain even as he snapped the cover 
shut.
He sat still for minutes, every 
muscle taut. 

It was a long time before he 
opened the book again, and by that 
time he had a perfectly reasonable 
explanation. It must be that Jane 
hadn't restricted herself to assigned spaces. When she had something extra to write, she wrote it 



THE OTHER NOW 



55 



on past the page allotted for a 
given date. 
Of course! 

Jimmy fumbled back to the last 
written page, where the pencil had 
been, with a tense matter-of-factness. It was, as he'd noticed, today's 
date. The page was filled. The 
writing was fresh. It was Jane's 
handwriting. 

"Went to the cemetery," said the 
sprawling letters. "// was very bad. 
Three months since the accident and 
it doesn't get any easier. I'm developing a personal enmity to 
chance. It doesn't seem like an abstraction any more. It was chance 
that killed Jimmy. It could have 
been me instead, or neither of us. I 
wish — " 

Jimmy went quietly mad for a 
moment or two. When he came to 
himself he was staring at an empty 
desk-blotter. There wasn't any 
book before him. There wasn't any 
pencil between his fingers. He remembered picking up the pencil 
and writing desperately under 
Jane's entry, "fane.'" he'd written 
— and he could remember the look 
of his scrawled script under Jane's 
— "where are yon? I'm not dead! 
I thought you were! In God's name, 
where are you?" 

But certainly nothing of the sort 
could have happened. It was delusion. 

That night was particularly bad, 
but curiously not as bad as some 
other nights had been. Jimmy had 
a normal man's horror of insanity, 



yet this wasn't, so to speak, normal 
insanity. A lunatic has always an 
explanation for his delusions. 
Jimmy had none. He noted the fact. 
Next morning he bought a small 
camera with a flash-bulb attachment 
and carefully memorized the directions for its use. This was the thing 
that would tell the story. And that 
night, when he got home, as usual 
after dark, he had the camera 
ready. He unlocked the door and 
opened it. He put his hand out 
tentatively. The door was still 
closed. 

He stepped back and quickly 
snapped the camera. There was a 
sharp flash of the bulb. The glare 
blinded him. But when he put out 
his hand again, the door was open. 
He stepped into the living-room 
without having to unlock and open 
it a second time. 

HE LOOKED at the desk as he 
turned the film and put in a 
new flash-bulb. It was as empty as 
he'd left it in the morning. He 
hung up his coat and settled down 
tensely with his pipe. Presently he 
knocked out the ashes. There were 
cigarct butts in the tray. 

He qujvered a little. He smoked 
again, carefully not looking at the 
desk. It was not until he knocked 
out the second pipeful of ashes 
that he let himself look where 
Jane's diary had been. 

It was there again. The book was 
open. There was a ruler laid across 
it to keep it open. 



56 




 



Jimmy wasn't frightened, and he 
wasn't hopeful. There was absolutely no reason why this should 
happen to him. He was simply desperate and grim when he went 
across the room. He saw yesterday's entry, and his own hysterical 
message. And there was more writing beyond that. 

In Jane's hand. 

"Darling, maybe I'm going 
crazy. But I think you wrote me as 
if you were alive. Maybe I'm crazy 
to answer you. But please, darling, 
if you are alive somewhere and 
somehow — " 

There was a tear-blot here. The 
rest was frightened, and tender, and 
as desperate as Jimmy's own sensations. 

He wrote, with trembling fingers, 
before he put the camera into position and pressed the shutter-control 
for the second time. 

When his eyes recovered from 
the flash, there was nothing on the 
desk. 

He did not sleep at all that night, 
nor did he work the next day. He 
went to a photographer with the 
film and paid an extravagant fee 
to have the film developed and enlarged at once. He got back two 
prints, quite distinct. Even very 
clear, considering everything. One 
looked like a trick shot, showing 
a door twice, once open and once 
closed, in the same photograph. 
The other was a picture of an open 
book and he could read every word 
on its pages. It was inconceivable 



that such a picture should have 
come out. 

He walked around practically at 
random for a couple of hours, looking at the pictures from time to 
time. Pictures or no pictures, the 
thing was nonsense. The facts were 
preposterous. It must be that he 
only imagined seeing these prints. 
But there was a quick way to find 
out. 

He went to Haynes. Haynes was 
his friend and reluctantly a lawyer 
— reluctantly because law practice 
interfered with a large number of 
unlikely hobbies. 

"Haynes," said Jimmy quietly, "I 
want you to look at a couple of 
pictures and see if you see what I 
do. I may have gone out of my 
head." 

HE PASSED over the picture of 
the door. It looked to Jimmy 
like two doors, nearly at righ. 
angles, in the same door-frame and 
hung from the same hinges. 

Haynes looked at it and said tolerantly, "Didn't know you went in 
for trick photography." He picked 
up a reading glass and examined it 
in detail. "A futile but highly competent job. You covered half the 
film and exposed with the door 
closed, and then exposed for the 
other half of the film with the door 
open. A neat job of matching, 
though. You've a good tripod." 

"I held the camera in my hand," 
said Jimmy, with restraint. 

"You couldn't do it that way, 



THE OTHER NOW 



57 



Jimmy," objected Haynes. "Don't 
I ry to kid me." 

"I'm trying not to fool myself," 
said Jimmy. He was very pale. He 
handed over the other enlargement. 
What do you see in this?" 

Haynes looked. Then he jumped. 
He read through what was so plainly photographed on the pages of a 
diary that hadn't been before the 
camera. Then he looked at Jimmy' 
in palpable uneasiness. 

"Got any explanation?" asked 
Jimmy. He swallowed. "I — haven't 
any." 

He told what had happened to 
date, baldly and without any attempt to make it reasonable. 
Haynes gaped at him. But before 
long the lawyer's eyes grew shrewd 
and compassionate. As noted hitherto, he had a number of unlikely 
hobbies, among which was a loud 
insistence on a belief in a fourth 
dimension and other esoteric ideas, 
because it was good fun to talk authoritatively about them. But he 
had common sense, had Haynes, 
and a good and varied law practice. 

Presently he said gently, "If you 
want it straight, Jimmy ... I had 
a client once. She accused- a chap of 
beating her up. It was very pathetic. 
She was absolutely sincere. She 
real ly bel i e ved it. But her own 
family admitted that she'd made 
the marks on herself — and the doctors agreed that she'd unconsciously blotted it out of her mind 
afterward." 



"You suggest," said Jimmy 
composedly, "that I might have 
forged all that to comfort myself 
with, as soon as I could forget the 
forging. I don't think that's the 
case, Haynes. What possibilities 
does that leave?" 

Haynes hesitated a long time. He 
looked at the pictures again, scrutinizing especially the one that 
looked like a trick shot. 

TIi is is an amazingly good job 
of matching," he said wrily.' "I 
can't pick the place where the two 
exposures join. Some people might 
manage to swallow this, and the 
theoretic explanation is a lot better. 
The only trouble is that it couldn't 
happen." 

Jimmy waited. 

HAYNES went on awkwardly, 
"The accident in which Jane 
was killed. You were in your car. 
You came up behind a truck carrying structural steel. There was a 
long slim girder sticking way out 
behind, with a red rag on it. The 
truck had airbrakes. The driver 
jammed them on just after he'd 
passed over a bit of wet pavement. 
The truck stopped. Your car slid, 
even with the brakes locked. — It's 
nonsense, Jimmy!" 

"I'd rather you continued," said 
Jimmy, white. 

"You — ran into the truck, your 
car swinging a little as it slid. The 
girder came through the windshield. It could have hit you. It 
could have missed both of you. By 



53 




 



puce chance, it happened to hit 
Jane." 

"And killed her," said Jimmy 
very quietly. "Yes. But it might 
have been me. That diary entry is 
written as if it had been me. Did 
you notice?" 

There was a long pause in 
Haynes' office. The world outside 
the windows was highly prosaic 
and commonplace and normal. 
Haynes wriggled in his chair. 

"I think," he said unhappily, 
"you did the same as my girl client 
— forged that writing and then forgot it. Have you seen a doctor yet?" 

"I will," said Jimmy. "Systematize my lunacy for me first, Haynes. 
If it can be done." 

"It's not accepted science," said 
Haynes. "In fact, it's considered 
eyewash. But there have been speculations . . ." He grimaced. "First 
point is that it was pure chance 
that Jane was hit. It was just as 
likely to be you instead, or neither 
of you. If it had been you — " 

"Jane," said Jimmy, "would be 
living in our house alone, and she 
might very well have written that 
entry in the diary." 

"Yes," agreed Haynes uncomfortably. "I shouldn't suggest this, 
but — there are a lot of possible futures. We don't know which one 
will come about for us. Nobody 
except fatalists can argue with that 
statement. When today was in the 
future, there were a lot of possible 
todays. The present moment — now 
— is only one of any number of 



nows that might have been. So it's 
been suggested — mind you, this 
isn't accepted science, but pure charlatanry — it's been suggested that 
there may be more than one actual 
now. Before the girder actually hit, 
there were three nows in the possible future. One in which neither 
of you was hit, one in which you 
were hit, and one — " 

He paused, embarrassed. "So 
some people would say, how do we 
know that the one in which Jane 
was hit is the only now? They'd 
say that the others could have happened and that maybe they did." 

JIMMY nodded. 
"If that were true," he said 
detachedly, "Jane would be in a 
present moment, a now, where it 
was me who was killed. As I'm in 
a now where she was killed. Is that 
it?" 

Haynes shrugged. 

Jimmy thought, and said gravely, 
"Thanks. Queer, isn't it?" 

He picked up the two pictures 
and went out. 

Haynes was the only one who 
knew about the affair, and he worried. But it is not easy to denounce 
someone as insane, when there is 
no evidence that he is apt to be 
dangerous. He did go to the trouble 
to find out that Jimmy acted in a 
reasonably normal manner, working industriously and talking quite 
sanely in the daytime. Orffy Haynes 
suspected that of nights he went 
home and experienced the impossi


THE OTHER NOW

ble. Sometimes, Haynes suspected 
that the impossible might be the 
fact — that had been an amazingly 
good bit of trick photography — but 
it was too preposterous! Also, there 
was no reason for such a tiling to 
happen to Jimmy. 

FR a week after Haynes' 
pseudo-scientific explanation, 
however, Jimmy was almost lighthearted. He no longer had to remind himself that Jane was dead. 
He had evidence that she wasn't. 
She wrote to him in the diary which 
he found on her desk, and he read 
her messages and wrote in return. 
For a full week the sheer joy of 
simply being able to communicate 
with each other was enough. 

The second week was not so 
good. To know that Jane was alive 
was good, but to be separated from 
her without hope was not. There 
was no meaning in a cosmos in 
which one could only write loveletters to one's wife or husband in 
anotlicr now which only might have 
been. But for a while both Jimmy 
and Jane tried to hide this new 
hopelessness from each other. 

Jimmy explained this carefully to 
Haynes before it was all over. Their 
letters were tender and very natural, and presently there was even 
time for gossip and actual bits of 
choice scandal . . . 

Haynes met Jimmy on the street 
one day, Hiftcr about two weeks. 
Jimmy looked better, but he was 
drawn very fine. Though he greeted 



Haynes without constraint, Haynes 
felt awkward. After a little he said, 
"Er — Jimmy. That matter we were 
talking about the other day — 
Those photographs — " 

"Yes. You were right," said 
Jimmy casually. "Jane agrees. There 
is more than one now. In the now 
I'm in, Jane was killed. In the now 
she's in, I was killed." 

Haynes fidgeted. "Would you let 
me see that picture of the door 
again?" he asked. "A trick film 
like that simply can't be perfect! 
I'd like to enlarge that picture a 
little more. May I?" 

"You can have the film," said 
Jimmy. "I don't need it any more." 

Haynes hesitated. Jimmy, quite 
matter-of-factly, told him most of 
what had happened to date. But he 
had no idea what had started it. 
Haynes almost wrung his hands. 

"The thing can't be!" he said 
desperately. "You have to be crazy, 
Jimmy!" 

But he would not have said that 
to a man whose sanity he really suspected. 

Jimmy nodded. "Jane told me 
something, by the way. Did you 
have a near-accident night before 
last? Somebody almost ran into you 
out on the Saw Mill Road?" ' 

Haynes started and went pale. "I 
went around a curve and a car 
plunged out of nowhere on the 
wrong side of the road. We both 
swung hard. He smashed my fender 
and almost went off the road himself. But he went racing off with


60 




 



out stopping to see if I'd gone in 
the ditch and killed myself. If I'd 
been live feet nearer the curve when 
he came out of it — " 

"Where Jane is," said Jimmy, 
"you were. Just about five feet 
nearer the curve. It was a bad 
smash. Tony Shields was in the 
other car. It killed him — where 
Jane is." 

Haynes licked his lips. It was 
absurd, but he said, "How about 
me?" 

"Where Jane is," Jimmy told 
him, "you're in the hospital." 

Haynes swore in unreasonable 
irritation. There wasn't any way 
for Jimmy to know about that nearaccident. He hadn't mentioned it, 
because he'd no idea who'd been in 
the other car. 

"I don't believe it!" But he said 
pleadingly, "Jimmy, it isn't so, is 
it? How in hell could you account 
for it?" 

Jimmy shrugged. "Jane and I — 
we're rather fond of each other." 
The understatement was so patent 
that he smiled faintly. "Chance 
separated us. The feeling we have 
for each other draws us together. 
There's a saying about two people 
becoming one flesh. If such a thing 
could happen, it would be Jane and 
me. After all, maybe only a tiny 
pebble or a single extra drop of 
water made my car swerve enough 
to get her killed — where I am, that 
is. That's a very little thing. So 
with such a trifle separating us, and 
so much pulling us together — why, 



sometimes the barrier wears thin. 
She leaves a door closed in the 
house where she is. I open that same 
door where I am. Sometimes I have 
to open the door she left closed, too. 
That's all." 

HAYNES didn't say a word, but 
the question he wouldn't ask 
was so self-evident that Jimmy answered it. 

"We're hoping," he said. "It's 
pretty bad being separated, but the 
— phenomena keep up. So we hope. 
Her diary is sometimes in the now 
where she is, and sometimes in this 
now of mine. Cigaret butts, too. 
Maybe — " That was the only time 
he showed any sign of emotion. He 
spoke as if his mouth were dry. "If 
ever I'm in her now or she's in 
mine, even for an instant, all the 
devils in hell couldn't separate us 
again! — We hope." 

Which was insanity. In fact, it 
was the third week of insanity. 
He'd told Haynes quite calmly that 
Jane's diary was on her desk every; 
night, and there was a letter to him 
in it, and he wrote one to her. He 
said quite calmly that the barrier 
between them seemed to be growing thinner. That at least once, when 
he went to bed, he was sure that' 
there was one more cigaret stub in 
the ashtray than had been there 
earlier in the evening. 

They were very near indeed. They 
were separated only by the difference between what was and what 
might have been. In one sense the 



THE OTHER NOW 



41 



difference was a pebble or a drop 
of water. In another, the difference 
was that between life and death. 
But they hoped. They convinced 
themselves that the barrier grew 
thinner. Once, it seemed to Jimmy 
that they touched hands. But he was 
not sure. He was still sane enough 
not to be sure. And he told all this 
to Haynes in a matter-of-fact fashion, and speculated mildly on what 
had started it all . . . 

Then, one night, Haynes called 
Jimmy on the telephone. Jimmy answered. 

He sounded impatient. 

"Jimmy!" said Haynes. He was 
almost hysterical. "I think I'm insane ! You know you said Tony 
.Shields was in the car that hit me?" 

"Yes," said Jimmy politely. 
"What's the matter?" 

"It's been driving me crazy," 
wailed Haynes feverishly. "You 
said he was killed — there. But I 
hadn't told a soul about the incident. So — so just now I broke 
down and phoned him. And it was 
Tony Shields ! That near -crash 
scared him to death, and I gave him 
hell and — he's paying for my 
fender! I didn't tell him he was 
killed." 

Jimmy didn't answer. It didn't 
seem to matter to him. 

"I'm coming over!" said Haynes 
feverishly. "I've got to talk!" 

"No," said Jimmy. "Jane and I 
are pretty close to each other. We've 
touched each other again. We're 
hoping. The barrier's wearing 



through. We hope it's going to 
break." 

"But it can't!" protested Haynes, 
shocked at the idea of improbabilities in the preposterous. "It — it 
can't! What'd happen if you turned 
up where she is, or — or if she 
turned up here?" 

"I don't know," said Jimmy, 
"but we'd be together." 

"You're crazy ! You mustn't — " 

"Goodbye," said Jimmy politely. 
"I'm hoping, Haynes. Something 
has to happen. It has to!" 

His voice stopped. There was a 
noise in the room behind him; 
Haynes heard it. Only two words, 
and those faintly, and over a telephone, but he swore to himself that 
it was Jane's voice, throbbing with 
happiness. The two words Haynes 
thought he heard were, "Jimmy! 
Darling!" 

Then the telephone crashed to 
the floor and Haynes heard no 
more. Even though he called back 
frantically again, Jimmy didn't answer. 

HAYNES sat up all that night, 
practically gibbering, and he 
tried to call Jimmy again next 
morning, and then tried his office, 
and at last went to the police. He 
explained to them that Jimmy had 
been in a highly nervous state since 
the death of his wife. 

So finally the police broke into 
the house. They had to break in 
because every door and window was 
carefully fastened from the inside, 



f.2 




 



as if Jimmy had been very careful 
to make sure nobody could interrupt what he and Jane hoped would 
occur. But Jimmy wasn't in the 
house. There was no trace of him. 
It was exactly as if he had vanished 
into the air. 

Ultimately the police dragged 
ponds and such things for his body, 
but they never found any clues. 
Nobody ever saw Jimmy again. It 
was recorded that Jimmy simply 
left town, and everybody accepted 
that obvious explanation. 

THE thing that really bothered 
Haynes was the fact that 
Jimmy had told him who'd almost 
crashed into him on the Saw Mill 
Road, and it was true. That was, to 
understate, hard to take. And there 
was the double-exposure picture of 
Jimmy's f ront door, which was 
much more convincing than any 
other trick picture Haynes had ever 
seen. But on the other hand, if it 
did happen, why did it happen only 
to Jimmy and jane? What set it 
off? What started it? Why, in 
effect, did those oddities start at 
that particular time, , to those particular people, in that particular 
fashion? In fact, did anything happen at all? 

Now, after Jimmy's disappearance, Haynes wished he could talk 
with him once more — talk sensibly, 



quietly, without fear and hysteria 
and this naggingly demanding wonderment. 

For he had sketched to Jimmy, 
and Jimmy had accepted (hadn't 
he?) the possibility of the other 
now — but with that acceptance came 
still others. In one, Jane was dead. 
In one, Jimmy was dead. It was 
between these two that the barrier 
had grown so thin . . . 

If he could talk to Jimmy about 

it! 

There was also a now in which 
both had died, and another in 
which neither had died! And if it 
was togetherness that each wanted 
so desperately . . . which was it? 

These were things that Haynes 
would have liked very much to 
know, but he kept his mouth shut, 
or calm men in white coats would 
have come and taken him away for 
treatment. As they would have 
taken jimmy. 

The only thing really sure was 
that it was all impossible. But to 
someone who liked Jimmy and Jane 
— and doubtless to Jimmy and to 
Jane themselves — no matter which 
barrier had been broken, it was a 
rather satisfying impossibility. 

Haynes' car had been repaired. 
He could easily have driven out to 
the cemetery. For some reason, he 
never did.

Mr. James 



By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 

Surprise endings in science fiction are not easy to attain 
successfully. This story has four internal plot surprises! 



HE CAME alive from nothing. He became aware from 
unawareness. He smelled the air of the night 
and heard the trees whispering on 
the embankment above him and 
the breeze that had set the trees to 



whispering came down- to him and 
felt him over with soft and tender 
fingers, for all the world as if it 
were examining him for broken 
bones or contusions and abrasions. 

He sat up and put both his 
palms down upon the ground be

side him to help him sit erect and 
stared into the darkness. Memorycame slowly and when it came it 
was incomplete and an swered 
nothing. 

His name was Henderson James 
and he was a human being and he 
was sitting somewhere on a planet 
that was called the Earth. He was 
thirty-six years old and he was, in 
his own way, famous, and comfortably well-off. He lived in an old 
ancestral home on Summit avenue, 
which was a respectable address 
even if it had lost some of its 
smartness in the last twenty years 
or so. 

On the road above the slope of 
the embankment a car went past 
with its tires whining on the pavement and for a moment its headlights made the trectops glow. Far 
away, muted by the distance, a 
whistle cried out. And somewhere 
else a dog was barking with a flat 
viciousness. 

His name was Henderson James 
and if that were true, why was he 
here? Why should Henderson 
James be sitting on the slope of an 
embankment, listening to the wind 
in the trees and to a wailing 
whistle and a barking dog? Something had gone wrong, some incident that, if he could but remember 
tt, might answer all his questions. 

There was a job to do. 

He sat and stared into the night 
and found that he was shivering, 
although there was no reason why 
he should, for the night was not 



that cold. Beyond the embankment 
he heard the sounds of a city late 
at night, the distant whine of the 
speeding car and the far-off windbroken screaming of a siren. Once 
a man walked along a street close 
by and James sat listening to his 
footsteps until they faded out of 
hearing. 

Something had happened and 
there was a job to do, a job that 
he had been doing, a job that somehow had been strangely interrupted 
by the inexplicable incident which 
had left him lying here on this 
embankment. 

H e checked hi msel f . Clothing 
. . . shorts and shirt, strong shoes, 
his wristwatch and the gun in the 
holster at his side. 

A gun? 

The job involved a gun. 

He had been hunting in the city, 
hunting something that required a 
gun. Something that was prowling 
in the night and a thing that must 
be killed' 

THEN he knew the answer, but 
even as he knew it he sat for 
a moment wondering at the 
strange, methodical, step-by-step 
progression of reasoning that had 
brought him to the memory. First 
his name and the basic facts pertaining to himself, then the realization of where he was and the 
problem of why he happened to be 
there and finally the realization that 
he had a gun and that it was meant 
to be used. It was a logical way to 




 



think, a primer schoolbook way to 
work it out: 

I am a man named Henderson 
James. 

I live in a house on Summit avenue. 

Am I in the house on Summit 
avenue ? 

No, I am not in the house on 
Summit avenue. 

I am on an # embankment somewhere. 

Why am I on the embankment? 

But it wasn't the way a man 
thought, at least not the normal 
way a normal man would think. 
Man thought in shortcuts. He cut 
across the block and did not go all 
the way around. 

It was a frightening thing, he 
told himself, this clear-around- theblock thinking. It wasn't normal 
and it wasn't right and it made no 
sense at all . . . no more sense than 
did the fact that he should find 
himself in a place with no memory 
of getting there. 

HE ROSE to his feet and ran his 
hands up and down his 
body. His clothes were neat, not 
rumpled. He hadn't been beaten 
up and he hadn't been thrown from 
a speeding car. There were no sore 
places on his body and his face was 
unbloody and whole and he felt 
all right. 

He hooked his fingers in the 
holster belt and shucked it up so 
that it rode tightly on his hips. He 
pulled out the gun and checked it 



with expert and familiar fingers and 
the gun was ready. 

He walked up the embankment 
and reached the road, went across it 
with a swinging stride to reach the 
sidewalk that fronted the row of 
new bungalows. He heard a cat 
coming and stepped off the sidewalk to crouch in a clump of evergreens that landscaped one corner 
of a lawn. The move was instinctive and he crouched there, feeling 
just a little foolish at the thing 
he'd done. 

The car went past and no one 
saw him. They would not, he now 
realized, have noticed him even if 
he had remained out on the sidewalk. 

He was unsure of himself; that 
must be the reason for his fear. 
There was a blank spot in his life, 
some mysterious incident that he 
did not know and the unknowing 
of it had undermined the sure and 
solid foundation of his own existence, had wrecked the basis of his 
motive and had turned him, momentarily, into a furtive animal that 
darted and hid at the approach of 
his fellow men. 

That and something that had 
happened to him that made him 
think clear around the block. 

He remained crouching in the 
evergreens, watching the street and 
the stretch of sidewalk, conscious of 
the white-painted, ghostly bungalows squatting back in their landscaped lots. 

A word came into his mind. 



GOOD NIGHT. MR. JAMES 



67 



Puudly. An odd word, unearthly, 
jet it held terror. 

The puudly had escaped and that 
was why he was here, hiding on 
the front lawn of some unsuspecting and sleeping citizen, equipped 
with a gun and a determination to 
use it, ready to match his wits and 
the quickness of brain and muscle 
against the most bloodthirsty, hatefilled thing yet found in the Galaxy. 

The puudly was dangerous. It 
was not a thing to harbor. In fact, 
there was a law against harboring 
not only a puudly, but certain other 
alien beasties even less lethal than a 
puudly. There was good reason for 
such a law, reason which no one, 
much less himself, would ever think 
to question. 

And now the puudly was loose 
and somewhere in the city. 

JAMES grew cold at the thought 
of it, his brain forming images 
of the things that might come to 
pass if he did not hunt down the 
alien beast and put an end to it. 

Although beast was not quite 
the word to use. The puudly was 
more than a beast . . . just how 
much more than a beast he once 
had hoped to learn. He had not 
learned a lot, he now admitted to 
himself, not nearly all there was 
to learn, but he had learned 
enough. More than enough to 
frighten him. 

For one thing, he had learned 
what hate could be and how shallow an emotion human hate turned 



out when measured against the 
depth and intensity and the ravening horror of the puudly '$ hate. 
Not unreasoning hate, for unreasoning hate defeats itself, but a rational, calculating, driving hate 
that motivated a clever and deadly 
killing machine which directed its 
rapacity and its cunning against 
every living thing that was not a 
puudly. 

For the beast had a mind and a 
personality that operated upon the 
basic law of self-preservation 
against all comers, whoever they 
might be, extending that law to the 
interpretation that safety lay in 
one direction only ... the death of 
every other living being. No other 
reason was needed for a puud/y's 
killing. The fact that anything else 
lived and moved and was thus posing a threat, no matter how remote, 
against a puudly, was sufficient 
reason in itself. 

It was psychotic, of course, some 
murderous instinct planted far back 
in time and deep in the creature's 
racial consciousness, but no more 
psychotic, perhaps, than many human instincts. 

The puudly had been, and still 
was for that matter, a unique opportunity for a study in alien behaviorism. Given a permit, one 
could have studied them on their 
native planet. Refused a permit, 
one sometimes did a foolish thing, 
as James had. 

And foolish acts backfire, as tills 
one did. 



63 




 



James put down a hand and patted the gun at his side, as if by 
doing so he might derive some assurance that he was equal to the 
task. There was no question in his 
mind as to the thing that must be 
done. He must rind the puudiy and 
kill it and he must do that before 
the break of dawn. Anything less 
than that would be abject and horrifying failure. 

For the puudiy would bud. It 
was long past its time for the reproductive act and there were bare 
hours left to 'find it before it had 
loosed upon the Earth dozens of 
baby puudl'ies. They would not remain babies for long. A few hours 
after budding they would strike 
out on their own. To find one 
puudiy, lost in the vastness of a 
sleeping city, seemed bad enough; 
to track down some dozens of them 
would be impossible. 

So it was tonight or never. 

Tonight there would be no killing on the puudiy' s part. Tonight 
the beast would be intent on one 
thing only, to find a place where 
it could rest in quiet, where it 
could give itself over, wholeheartedly and with no interference, to 
the business of bringing other 
puudlies into being. 

It was clever. It would have 
known where it was going before 
it had escaped. There would be, 
on its part, no time wasted in seeking or in doubling back. It would 
have known where it was going 
and already it was there, already 



the buds would be rising on its 
body, bursting forth and growing. 

There was one place, and one 
place only, in the entire city where 
an alien beast would be safe from 
prying eyes. A man could figure 
that one out and so could a puudiy. 
The question was: Would the 
puudiy know that a man could 
figure it out? Would the puudiy 
underestimate a man ? Or, knowing 
that the man would know it, too, 
would it find another place of hiding? 

James rose from the evergreens 
and went down the sidewalk. The 
street marker at the corner, standing underneath a swinging street 
light, told him where he was and 
it was closer to the place where he 
was going than he might have 
hoped. 

II 

THE zoo was quiet for a while, 
and then something sent up a 
howl that raised James' hackles and 
made his blood stop in his veins. 

James, having scaled the fence, 
stood tensely at its foot, trying to 
identify the howling animal. He 
was unable to place it. More than 
likely, he told himself, it was a new 
one. A person simply couldn't keep 
track of all the zoo's occupants. 
New ones were coming in all the 
time, strange, unheard of creatures 
from the distant stars. 

Straight ahead lay the unoccupied moat cage that up until a day 



GOOD NIGHT. MR. JAMES 



69 



or two before had held an unbelievable monstrosity from the jungles of one of the Arctian worlds. 
James grimaced in the dark, remembering the thing. They had 
finally had to kill it. 

And now the puudly was there 
. . . well, maybe not there, but one 
place that it could be, the one place 
in the entire city where it might be 
seen and arouse no comment, for 
the 200 was filled with animals that 
were seldom seen and another 
strange one would arouse only momentary wonder. One animal more 
would go unnoticed unless some 
zoo attendant should think to check 
the records. 

There, in that unoccupied cage 
area, the puudly would be undisturbed, could quietly go about its 
business of budding out more 
pundlies. No one would bother it, 
for things like pundlies were the 
normal occupants of this place set 
aside for the strangers brought to 
Earth to be stared at and studied by 
that ferocious race, the humans. 

James stood quietly beside the 
fence. 

Henderson James. Thirty-six. Unmarried. Alien psychologist. An 
official of this i:oo. And an offender 



against the law for having secured 
and harbored an alien being that 
was barred from Earth. 

Why, he asked himself, did he 
think of himself in this way? Why, 
standing here, did he catalogue 
himself? It was instinctive to know 
one's self . . . there was no need, 
no sense of setting up a mental outline of one's self. 

It had been foolish to go ahead 
with this puudly business. He recalled how he had spent days fighting it out with himself, reviewing 
all the disastrous possibilities which 
might arise from it. If the old 
renegade spaceman had not come 
to him and had not said, over a 
bottle of most delicious Lupan 
wine, that he could deliver, for a 
certain, rather staggering sum, one 
live puudly, in good condition, it 
never would have happened. 

JAMES was sure that of himself 
he never would have thought 
of it. But the old space captain was 
a man he knew and admired from 
former dealings. He was a man who 
was not averse to turning either an 
honest or a dishonest dollar, and 
yet he was a man, for all of that, 
that you could depend upon. He 




 




would do what you paid him for 
and keep his lip buttoned tight 
once the deed was done. 

James had wanted a puudly, for 
it was a most engaging beast with 
certain little tricks that, once understood, might open up new avenues of speculation and approach, 
might write new chapters in the 
tortuous study of alien minds and 
manners. 

But for all of that, it had been a 
terrifying thing to do and now that 
the beast was loose, the terror was 
compounded. For it was not wholly 
.beyond speculation that the descendants of this one brood that the 
escaped puudly would spawn might 
wipe out the population of the 
Earth, or at the best, make the 
Earth untenable for its rightful 
dwellers. 

A place like the Earth, with its 
teeming millions, would provide a 
field day for the fangs of the 
puudlies, and the minds that drove 
the fangs. They would not hunt for 
hunger, nor for the sheer madness 
of the kill, but because of the compelling conviction that no puudly 



GOOD NIGHT. MR. JAMES 



would be safe until Earth was 
wiped clean of life. They would be 
killing for survival, as a cornered 
rat would kill . . . except that they 
would be cornered nowhere but in 
the murderous insecurity of their 
minds. 

If the posses scoured the Earth to 
hunt them down, they would be 
found in all directions, for they 
would be shrewd enough to scatter. 
They would know the ways of guns 
and traps and poisons and there 
would be more and more of them 
as time went on. Each of them 
would accelerating their budding to 
replace with a dozen or a hundred 
the ones that might be killed. 

James moved quietly forward to 
the edge of the moat and let himself down into the mud that covered the bottom. -When the monstrosity had been killed, the moat 
had been drained and should long 
since have been cleaned, but the 
press of work, James thought, must 
have prevented its getting done. 

Slowly he waded out into the 
mud, feeling his way, his feet making sucking noises as he pulled 
them through the slime. Finally he 
reached the rocky incline that led 
out of the moat to the island cage. 

He stood 'for a moment, his 
hands on the great, wet boulders, 
listening, trying to hold his breath 
so the sound of it would not interfere with hearing. The thing that 
howled had quieted and the night 
was deathly quiet. Or seemed, at 
first, to be. Then he heard the little 



insect noises that ran through the 
grass and bushes and the whisper 
of the leaves in the trees across the 
moat and the far-off sound that was 
the hoarse breathing of a sleeping 
city. 

NOW, for the first time, he felt 
fear. Felt it in the silence that 
was not a silence, in the mud beneath his feet, in the upthrust 
boulders that rose out of the moat. 

The puudly was a dangerous 
thing, not only because it was 
strong and quick, but because it was 
intelligent. Just how intelligent, he 
did not know. It reasoned and it 
planned and schemed. It could talk, 
though not as a human talks . . . 
probably better than a human ever 
could. For it not only could talk 
words, but it could talk emotions. 
It lured its victims to it by the 
thoughts it put into their minds; it 
held them entranced with dreams 
and illusion until it slit their 
throats. It could purr a man to 
sleep, could lull him to suicidal inaction. It could drive him crazy 
with a single flicking thought, 
hurling a perception so foul and 
alien that the mind ' recoiled deep 
inside itself and stayed there, 
coiled tight, like a watch that has 
been overwound and will not run. 

It should have budded long ago, 
but it had fought off its budding, 
holding back against the day when 
it might escape, planning, he realized now, its fight to stay on Earth, 
which meant its conquest of Earth. 



72 




 



It had planned, and planned well, 
against this very moment, and it 
would feel or show no mercy to 
anyone who interfered with it. 

His hand went down and 
touched the gun and he felt the 
muscles in his jaw involuntarily 
tightening and suddenly there was 
at once a lightness and a hardness 
in him that had not been there before. He pulled himself up the 
boulder face, seeking cautious handand toeholds, breathing shallowly, 
body pressed against the rock. 
Quickly, and surely, and no noise, 
for he must reach the top and be 
there before the piiudly knew there 
was anyone around. 

The pnudly would be relaxed 
and intent upon its. business, engrossed in the budding forth of that 
numerous family that in days to 
come would begin the grim and relentless crusade to make an alien 
planet safe for puudlies . . . and 
for puudlies alone. 

That is, if the pnudly were here 
and not somewhere else. James 
was only a human trying to think 
like a pnudly and that was not an 
easy or a pleasant job and he had 
no way of knowing if he succeeded. 
He could only hope that his reasoning was vicious and crafty enough. 

His clawing hand found grass 
and earth and he sank his fingers 
deep into the soil, hauling his body 
up the last few feet of the rock face 
above the pit. 

He lay flat upon the gently sloping ground, listening, tensed for 



any danger. He studied the ground 
in front of him, probing every 
foot. Distant street lamps lighting 
the zoo walks threw back the total 
blackness that had engulfed him as 
he climbed out of the moat, but 
there still were areas of shadow that 
he had to study closely. 

INCH by inch, he squirmed his 
way along, making sure of the 
terrain immediately ahead before 
he moved a muscle. He held the 
gun in a rock-hard fist, ready for 
instant action, watching for the 
faintest hint of motion, alert for 
any hump or irregularity that was 
not rock or bush or grass. 

Minutes magnified themselves 
into hours, his eyes ached with staring and the lightness that had been 
in him drained away, leaving only 
the hardness, which was as tense 
as a drawn bowstring. A sense of 
failure began to seep into his mind 
and with it came the full-fledged, 
until now unadmitted, realization 
of what failure meant, not only for 
the world, but for the dignity and 
the pride that was Henderson 
James. 

Now, faced with the possibility, 
he admitted to himself the action he 
must take if the puudly were not 
here, if he did not find it here and 
kill it. He would have to notify the 
authorities, would have to attempt 
to alert the police, must plead with 
newspapers and radio to warn the 
citizenry, must reveal himself as a 
man who, through pride and self


GOOD NIGHT. MR. JAMES 



73 



conceit, had exposed the people of 
the Earth to this threat against their 
hold upon their native planet. 

They would not believe him. 
They would laugh at him until the 
laughter died in their torn throats, 
choked off with their blood. He 
sweated, thinking of it, thinking of 
the price this city, and the world, 
would pay be f ore it learned th e 
truth. 

There was a whisper of sound, a 
movement of black against deeper 
black. 

The puudly rose in front of him, 
not more than six feet away, from 
its bed beside a bush. He jerked 
the pistol up and his finger tightened on the trigger. 

"Don't," the puudly sa/d inside 
his mind. "I'll go along with you." 

His finger strained with the careful slowness of the squeeze and the 
gun leaped in his hand, but even as 
it did he felt the whiplash of terror 
slash at his brain, caught for just a 
second the terrible import, the 
mind-shattering obscenity that 
glanced off his mind and riccocheted away. 

"Too late," he told the puudly, 
with his voice and his mind and his 
body shaking. "You should have 
tried that first. You wasted precious 
seconds. You would have got me if 
you had done it first." 

It had been easy, he assured himself, much easier than he had 
thought. The puudly was dead or 
dying and the Earth and its millions of unsuspecting citizens were 



safe and, best of all, Henderson 
James was safe . . . safe from indignity, safe from being stripped 
naked of the little defenses he had 
built up through the years to shield 
him against the public stare. He 
felt relief flood over him and it left 
him pulseless and breathless and 
feeling clean, but weak. 

"You fool," the dying puudly 
said, death clouding its words as 
they built up in his mind. "You 
fool, you half-thing, you duplicate . . ." 

It died then and he felt it die, 
felt the life go out of it and leave 
it empty. 

TTE ROSE softly to his feet and 
-I- J- he seemed stunned and at 
first he thought it was from knowing death, from having touched 
hands with death within the 
puudly $ mind. 

The puudly had tried to fool 
him. Faced with the pistol, it had 
tried to throw him off his balance 
to give it the second that it needed 
to hurl the mind-blasting thought 
that had caught at the edge of his 
brain. If he had hesitated for a 
moment, he knew, it would have 
been all over with him. If his finger 
had slackened for a moment, it 
would have been too late. 

The puudly must have known 
that he would think of the zoo as 
the first logical place to look and, 
even knowing that, it had held him 
in enough contempt to come here, 
had not even bothered to try to 



74 




 



watch for him, had not tried to 
stalk him, had waited until he was 
almost on top of it before it moved. 

And that was queer, for the 
puudly must have known, with its 
uncanny mental powers, every move 
that he had made. It must have 
maintained a casual contact with 
his mind every second of the time 
since it had escaped. He had known 
that and . . . wait a minute, he 
hadn't known it until this very moment, although, knowing it now, it 
seemed as if he had always known 
it. 

What is the matter with me, he 
thought. There's something wrong 
with me. I should have known I 
could not surprise the puudly, and 
yet I didn't know it. I must have 
surprised it, for otherwise it would 
have finished me off quite leisurely 
at any moment after I climbed out 
of the moat. 

You fool, the puudly hid said. 
You fool, you half-tliing. you duplicate . . . 

You duplicate! 

He felt the strength and the 
personality and the hard, unquestioned identity of himself as Henderson James, human being, drain 
out of him, as if someone had cut 
the puppet string and he, the puppet, had slumped supine upon the 
stage. 

So that was why he had been able 
to surprise the puudly! 

There were two Henderson 
Jameses. The puudly had been in 
contact with one of them, the orig


inal, the real Henderson James, 
had known every move he made, 
had known that it was safe so far 
as that Henderson James might be 
concerned. It had not known of 
the second Henderson Junes that 
had stalked it through the night. 

Henderson James, duplicate. 

Henderson James, temporary. 

Henderson James, here tonight, 
gone tomorrow. 

FOR they would not let him live. 
The original Henderson James 
would not allow him to continue 
living, and even if he did. the world 
would not allow it. Duplicates were 
made only for very temporary and 
very special reasons and it was always understood that once their 
purpose was accomplished they 
would be done away with. 

Done away with . . . those were 
the words exactly. Gotten out of 
the way. Swept out of sight and 
mind. Killed as unconcernedly and 
emotionlessly as one chops off a 
chicken's head. 

He walked forward and dropped 
on one knee beside the puudly, 
running his hand over its body in 
the darkness. Lumps stood out all 
over it, the swelling buds that now 
would never break to spew forth in 
a loathsome birth a brood of 
puudly pups. 

He rose to his feet. 
The job was done. The puudly 
had been killed — killed before it 
had given birth to a horde of 
horrors. 



GOOD NIGHT, MR. JAMES 



The job was done and he could 
go home. 
Home ? 

Of course, that was the thing 
that had been planted in his mind, 
the thing they wanted him to do. 
To go home, to go back to the 
house on Summit avenue, where his 
executioners would wait, to walk 
back deliberately and unsuspectingly to the death that waited. 

The job was done and his usefulness was over. He had been created to perform a certain task and 
the task was now performed and 
while an hour ago he had been a 
factor in the plans of men, he was 
no longer wanted. He was an embarrassment and superfluous. 

Now wait a minute, he told himself. You may not be a duplicate. 
You do not feel like one. 

That was true. He felt like Henderson James. He was Henderson 
James. He lived on Summit avenue 
and had illegally brought to Earth 
a beast known as a puudly in order 
that he might study it and talk to it 
and test its alien reactions, attempt 
to measure its intelligence and guess 
at the strength and depth and the 
direction of its non-humanity. He 
had been a fool, of course, to do it, 
and yet at the time it had seemed 
important to understand the deadly, alien mentality. 

I am human, he said, and that 
was right, but even so the fact 
meant nothing. Of course he was 
human. Henderson James was human and his duplicate would be ex
76 



actly as human as the original. For 
the duplicate, processed from the 
pattern that held every trait and 
characteristic of the man he was to 
become a copy of, would differ in 
not a single basic factor. 

In not a single basic factor, perhaps, but in certain other things. 
For no matter how much the duplicate might be like his pattern, no 
matter how full-limbed he might 
spring from his creation, he still 
would be a new man. He would 
have the capacity for knowledge 
and for thought and in a little time 
he would have and know and be 
all the things that his original 
was . . . 

BUT it would take some time, 
some short while to come to a 
full realization of all he knew and 
was, some time to coordinate and 
recognize all the knowledge and 
experience that lay within his mind. 
At first he'd grope and search until 
he came upon the things that he 
must know. Until he became acquainted with himself, with the sort 
of man he was, he could not reach 
out blindly in the dark and put his 
hand exactly and unerringly upon 
the thing he wished. 

That had been exactly what he'd 
done. He had groped and searched. 
He had been compelled to think, at 
first, in simple basic truths and 
facts. 

I am a man. 

I am on a planet called Earth. 
I am Henderson James. 


 



I live on Summit avenue. 

There is a job to do. 

It had been quite a while, lie remembered now, before he had been 
able to dig out of his mind the nature of the job. 

There is a puudly to hunt down 
and destroy. 

Even now he could not find in 
the hidden, still-veiled recesses of 
his mind the many valid reasons 
why a man should run so grave a 
risk to study a thing so vicious as 
a puudly. There were reasons, he 
knew there were, and in a little 
time he would know them quite 
specifically. 

The point was that if he were 
Henderson James, original, he 
would know them now, know them 
as a part of himself and his life, 
without laboriously searching for 
them. 

The puudly had known, of 
course. It had known, beyond any 
chance of error, that there were 
two Henderson Jameses. It had 
been keeping tab on one when another one showed up. A mentality 
far less astute than the puudly' s 
would have had no trouble in figuring that one out. 

If the puudly had not talked, he 
told himself, I never would have 
known. If it had died at once and 
not had a chance to taunt me, I 
would not have known. I would 
even now be walking to the house 
on Summit avenue. 

He stood lonely and naked of 
soul in the wind that swept across 



the moated island. There was a sour 
bitterness in his mouth. 

He moved a foot and touched 
the dead puudly, 

"I'm sorry," he told the stiffening body. "I'm sorry now I did it. 
If I had known, I never would have 
killed you." 

Stiffly erect, he moved away. 

Ill 

HE STOPPED at the street corner, keeping well in the 
shadow. Halfway down the block, 
and on the other side, was the 
house. A light burned in one of the 
rooms upstairs and another on the 
post beside the gate that opened 
into the yard, lighting the walk up 
to the door. 

Just as if, he told himself, the 
house were waiting for the master 
to come home. And that, of course, 
was exactly what it was doing. An 
old lady of a house, waiting, hands 
folded in its lap, rocking very gently in a squeaky chair . . . and with 
a gun beneath the folded shawl. 

His lip lifted in half a snarl as 
he stood there, looking at the house. 
What do they take me for, he 
thought, putting out a trap in plain 
sight and one that's not even baited? Then he remembered. They 
would not know, of course, that he 
knew he was a duplicate. They 
would think that he would think 
that he was Henderson James, the 
one and only. They would expect 
him to come walking home, quite 



GOOD NIGHT. MR. JAMES 



77 



naturally, believing he belonged 
there. So far as they would know, 
there would be no possibility of his 
finding out the truth. 

And now that he had? Now that 
he was here, across the street from 
the waiting house? 

He had been brought into being, 
had been given life, to do a job 
that his original had not dared to 
do, or had not wanted to do. He 
had carried out a killing his original didn't want to dirty his hands 
with, or risk his neck in doing. 

Or had it not been that at all, but 
the necessity of two men working 
on the job, the original serving as 
a focus for the puudly's watchful 
mind while the other man sneaked 
up to kill it while it watched ? 

No matter what, he had been 
created, at a good stiff price, from 
the pattern of the man that was 
Henderson James. The wizardry of 
man's knowledge, the magic of machines, a deep understanding of organic chemistry, of human physiology, of the mystery of life, had 
made a second Henderson James. It 
was legal, of course, under certain 
circumstances . . , for example, in 
the case of public policy, and his 
own creation, he knew, might have 
been validated under such a heading. But there were conditions and 
one of these was that a duplicate 
not be allowed to continue living 
once it had served the specific purpose for which it had been created. 

Usually such a condition was a 
simple one to carry out, for the 



duplicate was not meant to know he 
was a duplicate. So far as he was 
concerned, he was the original. 
There was no suspicion in him, no 
foreknowledge of the doom that 
was invariably ordered for him, no 
reason for him to be on guard 
against the death that waited. 

The duplicate knitted his brow, 
trying to puzzle it out. 

There was a strange set of ethics 
here. 

HE WAS alive and he wanted 
to stay alive. Life, once it had 
been tasted, was too sweet, too 
good, to go back to the nothingness from which he had come . . . 
or would it be nothingness? Now 
that he had known life, now that 
he .was alive, might he not hope 
for a life after death, the same as 
any other human being? Might not 
he, too, have the same human right 
as any other human to grasp at the 
shadowy and glorious promises and 
assurances held out by religion and 
by faith? 

He tried to marshal what he 
knew about those promises and assurances, but his knowledge was 
illusive. A little later he would remember more about it. A little later, 
when the neural bookkeeper in his 
mind had been able to coordinate 
and activate the knowledge that he 
had inherited from the pattern, he 
would know. 

He felt a trace of anger stir deep 
inside of him, anger at the- unfairness of allowing him only a few 



78 




 



short hours of life, of allowing him 
to learn how wonderful a thing life 
was, only to snatch it from him. It 
was a cruelty that went beyond 
mere human cruelty. It was something that had been fashioned out 
of the distorted perspective of a 
machine society that measured existence only in terms of mechanical 
and physical worth, that discarded 
with a ruthless hand whatever part 
of that society had no specific purpose. 

The cruelty, he told himself, was 
in ever giving life, not in taking it 
away. 

His original, of course, was the 
one to blame. He was the one who 
had obtained the pnudly and allowed it to escape. It was his fumbling and his inability to correct his 
error without help which had created the necessity of fashioning a 
duplicate. 

And yet, could he blame him? 

Perhaps, rather, he owed him 
gratitude for a few hours of life at 
least, gratitude for the privilege of 
knowing what life was like. Although he could not quite decide 
whether or not it was something 
which called for gratitude. 

He stood there, staring at the 
house. That light in the upstairs 
room was in the study off the master bedroom. Up there Henderson 
James, original, was waiting for the 
word that the duplicate had come 
home to death. It was an easy thing 
to sit there and wait, to sit and 
wait for the word that was sure to 



come. An easy thing to sentence to 
death a man one had never seen, 
even if that man be the walking 
image of one's self. 

It would be a harder decision to 
kill him if you stood face to face 
with him . . . harder to kill someone who would be, of necessity, 
closer than a brother, someone who 
would be, even literally, flesh of 
your flesh, blood of your blood, 
brain of your brain. 

THERE would be a practical side 
as well, a great advantage to be 
able to work with a man who 
thought as you did, who would be 
almost a second self. It would be 
almost as if there were two of you. 

A thing like that could be arranged. Plastic surgery and a price 
for secrecy could make your duplicate into an unrecognizable other 
person. A little red tape, some 
finagling . . . but it could be done. 
It was a proposition that Henderson James, duplicate, thought would 
interest Henderson James, original. 
Or at least he hoped it would. 

The room with the light could 
be reached with a little luck, with 
strength and agility and determination. The brick expanse of a chimney, its base cloaked by shrubs, its 
length masked by a closely growing 
tree, ran up the wall. A man could 
climb its rough brick face, could 
reach out and swing himself 
through the open window into the 
lighted room. 

And once Henderson James, orig


GOOD NIGHT, MR. JAMES 



79 



inal, stood face to face with Henderson Jarrics, duplicate . . . well, 
it would be less of a gamble. The 
duplicate then would no longer be 
an impersonal factor. He would be 
a man and one that was very close 
to his original. 

There would be watchers, but 
they would be watching the front 
door. If he were quiet, if he could 
reach and climb the chimney without making any noise, he'd be in 
the room before anyone would notice. 

He drew back deeper in the 
shadows and considered. It was 
either get into the room and face 
his original, hope to be able to 
strike a compromise with him, or 
simply to light out ... to run and 
hide and wait, watching his chance 
to get completely away, perhaps to 
some far planet in some other part 
of the Galaxy. 

Both ways were a gamble, but 
one was quick, would either succeed or fail within the hour; the 
other might drag on for months 



with a man never knowing whether 
he was safe, never being sure. 

Something nagged at him, a persistent little fact that skittered 
through his brain and eluded his 
efforts to pin it down. It might be 
important and then, again, it might 
be a random thing, simply a floating piece of information that was 
looking for its pigeonhole. 

His mind shrugged it off. 

The quick way or the long way? 

He stood thinking for a moment 
and then moved swiftly down the 
street, seeking a place where he 
could cross in shadow. 

He had chosen the short way. 




SO 




 



IV 

THE. room was empty. 
He stood beside the window, 
quietly, only his eyes moving, 
searching every corner, checking 
against a situation that couldn't 
seem quite true . . . that Henderson 
James was not here, waiting for 
the word. 

Then he strode swiftly to the 
bedroom door and swung it open. 
His finger found the switch and the 
lights went on. The bedroom was 
empty and so was the bath. He 
went back into the study. 

He stood with his back against 
the wall, facing the door that led 
into the hallway, but his eyes went 
over the room, foot by foot, orienting himself, feeling himself flow 
into the shape and form of it, feeling familiarity creep in upon him 



and enfold him in its comfort of 
belonging. 

Here were the books, the fireplace with its mantel loaded with 
souvenirs, the easy chairs, the 
liquor cabinet . . . and all were a 
part of him, a background that was 
as much a part of Henderson James 
as his body and his inner thoughts 
were a part of him. 

This, he thought, is what I 
would have missed, the experience 
I never would have had if the 
ptiudly had not taunted me. I 
would have died an empty and unrelated body that had no actual 
place in the universe. 

The phone purred at him and he 
stood there startled by it, as if 
some intruder from the outside had 
pushed its way into the room, shattering the sense of belonging that 
had come to him. 




GOOD NIGHT, MR. JAMES 



81 



The phone rang again and he 
went across the room and picked 
it up. 

"James speaking," he said. 

"That you, Mr. James?" 

The voice was that of Anderson, 
the gardener. 

"Why, yes," said the duplicate. 
"Who did you think it w^s?" 

"We got a fellow here who says 
he's you." 

Henderson James, duplicate, 
stiffened with fright and his hand, 
suddenly, was grasping the phone 
so hard that he found the time to 
wonder why it did not pulverize to 
bits beneath his fingers. 

"He's dressed like you," the 
gardener said, "and I knew you 
went out. Talked to you, remember? Told you that you shouldn't? 
Not with us waiting for that . . . 
that thing." 

"Yes," said the duplicate, his 
voice so even that he could not believe it was he who spoke. "Yes, 
certainly I remember talking with 
you." 

"But, sir, how did you get 
back?" 

"I came in the back way," the 
even voice said into the phone. 
"Now what's holding you back?" 

"He's dressed like you." 

"Naturally. Of course he would 
be, Anderson." 

AND that, to be sure, didn't 
quite follow, but Anderson 
wasn't too bright to start with and 
now he was somewhat upset. 



"You remember," the duplicate 
said, "that we talked about it." 

"I guess I was excited and forgot," admitted Anderson. "You 
told me to call you, to make sure 
you were in your study, though. 
That's right, isn't it, sir?" 

"You've called me," the duplicate said, "and I am here." 

"Then the other one out here is 
him ?" 

"Of course," said the duplicate. 
"Who else could it be?" 

He put the phone back into the 
cradle and stood waiting. It came a 
moment after, the dull, throaty 
cough of a gun. 

He walked to a chair and sank 
into it, spent with the knowledge 
of how events had so been ordered 
that now, finally, he was safe, safe 
beyond all question. 

Soon he would have to change 
into other clothes, hide the gun and 
the clothes that he was wearing. 
The staff would ask no questions, 
most likely, but it was best to let 
nothing arouse suspicion in their 
minds. 

He felt his nerves quieting and 
he allowed himself to glance about 
the room, take in die books and 
furnishings, the soft and easy . . . 
and earned . . . comfort of a man 
solidly and unshakably established 
in the world. 

He smiled softly. 

"It will be nice," he said. 

It had been easy. Now that it 
was over, it seemed ridiculously 
easy. Easy because he had never 



82 




 



seen the man who had walked up 
to the door. It was easy to kill a 
man you have never seen. 

With each passing hour he 
would slip deeper and deeper into 
the personality that was his by 
right of heritage. There would be 
no one to question, after a time not 
even himself, that he was Henderson James. 

The phone rang again and he 
got up to answer it. 

A pleasant voice told him, "This 
is Allen, over at the duplication 
lab. We've been waiting for a report from you." 

"Well," said James, "I . . ." 

"I just called," interrupted 
Allen, "to tell you not to worry. It 
slipped my mind before." 



"I see," said James, though he 
didn't. 

"We did this one a little differently," Allen explained. "An experiment that we thought we'd try 
out. Slow poison in his bloodstream. Just another precaution. 
Probably not necessary, but we like 
to be positive. In case he fails to 
show up, you needn't worry any." 

"I am sure he will show up." 

Allen chuckled. "Twenty-four 
hours. Like a time bomb. No antidote for it even if he found out 
somehow." 

"It was good of you to let me 
know," said James. 

"Glad to," said Allen. "Good 
night, Mr. James."

GOOD NIGHT, MR. JAMES 



S3 



Socrates 

By JOHN CHRISTOPHER 



I HAD closed the lab for the Jennings, the caretaker, was 

afternoon and was walking holding a young puppy in his hand 

down toward the front gate, and beating its head against the 

meaning to take a bus into town, stone wall. At his feet were three 

when I heard the squeals from the dead puppies, and as I came 

direction of the caretaker's cottage, through the gate he tossed a fourth 

I'm fond of animals and hate to among them, and picked up the last 

hear them in pain, so I walked squirming remnant of the litter. I 

through the gate into the cottage called out sharply: 
yard. What I saw horrified me. "Jennings! What's going on?" 





 



A man's best friend may be his dog . . . but a dog's is not 
necessarily his master. A dog like Socrates, especially. 



Illustrated by PETER BURCHARO 



He turned to face me, sti/l holding the puppy in his hand. He is a 
surly-looking fellow at best, but 
now he looked thunderous. 

"What the hell do you think I'm 
doing?" he demanded. "Killing off 
a useless litter — that's what I'm doing." 

He held the pup out for me to 
observe. 



"Here," he went on, "have a look 
at this and you'll see why." 

I looked closely. It was the queerest pup I had ever seen. It had a 
dirty, tan coat and abnormally thick 
legs. But it was the head that drew 
attention. It must have been fully 
four times the size of any ordinarypup of its breed; so big thr.t, although its neck was sturdy, the 



SOCRATES 



85 



head seemed to dangle on it like an 
apple on a stalk.
"It's a queer one, all right," I 
admitted. 

"Queer?"' he exclaimed. "It's a 
monster, that's what it is." He 
looked at me angrily. "And I know 
the cause of it. I'm not a fool. There 
was a bit in the Sunday papers a 
couple of weeks back about it. It's 
them electrical X-ray machines you 
have up at the House. It said in the 
paper about X-rays being able to 
influence what's to be born and 
make monsters of them. And look 
at this for a litter of pedigree airedales ; not one that would make 
even a respectable mongrel. Thirty 
quid the price of this litter at the 
very least." 

"It's a pity," I said, "but I'm 
pretty sure the company won't accept responsibility. You must have 
let your bitch run loose beyond the 
inner gate and there's no excuse for 
that It's too bad you didn't see that 
bit in the Sunday paper a few 
weeks earlier; you might have kept 
her chained up more. You know 
you've been warned about going 
near the plant." 

"Yes," he snarled, "I know what 
chance I've got of getting money 
out of those crooks. But at least I 
can get some pleasure out of braining this lot." 

He prepared to swing the pup 
against the wall. It had been quiet 
while we were talking, but now it 
gave one low howl and open ed 
large eyes in a way that seemed 



fantastically to suggest that it had 
been listening to our conversation, 
and knew its fate was sealed. I 
grabbed hold of Jennings' arm 
pretty roughly. 

"Hold on," I said. "When did 
you say those pups were born?" 

"This morning," he growled. 

I said, "But its eyes are open. 
And look at the color! Have you 
ever seen an airedale with blue eyes 
before?" 

He laughed unpleasantly. "Has 
anybody ever seen an airedale with 
a head like that before, or a coat 
like that? It's no more an airedale 
than I am. It's a cur. And I know 
how to deal with it." 

THE pup was whining to itself, 
as though realizing the futility of making louder noises. I 
pulled my wallet out. 

"I'll give you a quid for it," I 
said. 

He whistled. "You must be 
mad," he said. "But why should 
that worry me? It's yours for the 
money. Taking it now?" 

"I can't," I said. "My landlady 
wouldn't let me. But I'll pay you 
ten bob a week if you will look 
after it till I can find it a place. Is 
it a deal?" 

He put his hand out again. "In 
advance?" 

I paid him. 

"I'll look after it, guv'nor, even 
though it goes against the grain. At 
any rate it'll give Glory something 
to mother." 



86 




 



AT LEAST once a day, sometimes twice, I used to call in 
to see how the pup was getting 
along. It was progressing amazingly. At the end of the second week 
Jennings asked for an increase of 
2/6d. in the charge for keeping it, 
and I had to agree. It had fed from 
the mother for less than a week, 
after which it had begun to eat its 
own food, and with a tremendous 
appetite. 

Jennings scratched his unkempt 
head when he looked at it. "I don't 
know. I've never seen a dog like it. 
Glory didn't give it no lessons in 
eating or drinking. It just watched 
her from the corner and one day, 
when I brought fresh stuff down, 
it set on it like a wolf. It ain't natural." 

Watching the pup eat, I was 
amazed myself. It seemed to have 
more capacity for food than its 
mother, and you could almost see 
it putting on weight and size. And 
its cleverness! It was hardly more 
than a fortnight old when I surprised it carefully pawing the latch 
of the kennel door open, to get at 
some food that Jennings had left 
outside while going out to open the 
gates. But even at that stage I don't 
think it was such superficial tricks 
that impressed me, so much as the 
way I would catch it watching 
Jennings and me as we leaned over 
the kennel fence discussing it. 
There was such an air of attentiveness about the way it sat, with one 
ear cocked, a puzzled frown on that 



broad-browed, most uncanine face. 

Jennings said one day, "Thought 
of a name for him yet?" 

"Yes," I said. "I'm going to call 
him Socrates." 

"Socrates?" repeated Jennings. 
"Something to do with football?" 

I smiled. "There was another 
great thinker with that name several thousand years ago. A Greek." 

"Oh," Jennings said scornfully, 
"a Greek . . .'* 

One Friday evening I brought a 
friend down to see Socrates — a man 
who had made a study of dogs. 
Jennings wasn't in. This didn't surprise me because he habitually got 
drunk at least one evening a week 
and Friday was his favorite. I took 
my friend around to the kennels. 

He didn't say anything when he 
saw the pup, which was now, after 
three weeks, the size of a large foxterrier. He examined it carefully, 
as though he were judging a prize 
winner at Cruft's. Then he put it 
down and turned to me. 

"How old did you say this dog 
is?" he asked. 

I told him. 

He shook his head. "If it were 
anyone but you who told me, I 
would call him a liar," he said. 
"Man, I've never seen anything 
like it. And that head . . . You say 
the rest of the litter were the 
same?" 

"The bodies looked identical," I 
told him. "That's what impressed 
me. You are liable to get queer 
freak mutations round these new 



SOCRATES 



27 



labs of ours — double-headed rats 
and that sort of thing — but five the 
same in one litter ! That looked 
like a true mutation to me." 

He said, "Mutations I'm a bit 
shaky about, but five alike in one 
litter look like a true breed to me. 
What a tragedy that fool killed 
them." 

"He killed a goose that might 
have laid him some very golden 
eggs," I said. "Quite apart from 
the scientific importance of it — I 
should imagine a biologist would 
go crazy at the thought — a new 
mutated breed like this would have 
been worth a packet. Even this one 
dog might have all sorts of possibilities. Look!" 

Socrates had pushed an old tin 
against the wall of the kennel and 
was using it in an attempt to scale 
the fence barring the way to the 
outer world. His paws scrabbled in 
vain a few inches from the top. 

"Good God!" my friend said. "If 
it can do that after a month . . ." 

WE TURNED and left the 
kennels. As we came out I 
collided with Jennings. He reeled 
drunkenly past us. 

"Come to feed little Shocratesh," 
he said thickly. 

I held his shoulder. "That's all 
right," I said. "We've seen to 
them." 

When I dropped in the following day, I was surprised to see a 
huge, roughly painted sign hanging 
over the kennel door. It read : 



PRIVATE. NO ADMITTANCE. 

I tried the door, but it was 
locked. I looked around. Jennings 
was watching me. 

"Hello, Professor," he said. 
"Can't you read?" 

I said, "Jennings, I've come for 
the pup. My friend is going to look 
after him at his" kennels." 

Jennings grinned. "Sorry," he 
said, "the dog's not for sale." 

"What do you mean?" I exclaimed. "I bought him four weeks 
ago. And I've been paying you for 
his keep." 

"You got any writing that says 
that, Professor?" he asked. "You 
got a bill of sale?" 

"Don't be ridiculous, Jennings," 
I said. "Open the door up." 

"You even got any witnesses?" 
he asked. He came over to me confidentially. 

"Look," he said, "you're a fair 
man. I heard you telling your 
friend last night that dog's a gold 
mine. You know I own him by 
rights. Here, I'm a fair man myself. Here's three pounds rive; the 
money I've had from you in the 
last four weeks. You know he's my 
gold mine by rights. You wouldn't 
try to do a man like me. You know 
I paid live cjuid stud fee for that 
litter." 

"It was a bargain," I said. "You 
were going to throw the pup at the 
wall— don't forget that. You 
wouldn't even know the dog was 
anything out of the ordinary now, 



88 




 



except for listening to a private conversation last night." I found my 
wallet "Here's ten pounds. That 
will make good the stud fee and a 
little extra profit for yourself into 
the bargain." 

He shook his head. "I'm not 
selling, Professor. And I know my 
rights in the law. You've got no 
proof; I've got possession." 

I said, "You idiot! What can 
you do with him? He will have to 
be examined by scientists, tested, 
trained. You don't know anything 
about it." 

Jennings spat on the ground. 
"Scientists!" he exclaimed. "No, 
I'm not taking him to no scientists. 
I've got a bit of money saved up. 
I'm off away from here tomorrow. 
VU do the training. And you watch 
the theaters for the big bill boards 
in a few months' time — George 
Jennings and his Wonder Dog, 
Socrates ! I'll be up at the West End 
inside a year." 

IT WAS only three months later 
that I saw the name on the bills 
outside the Empire Theater in Barcaster. There had been no word 
from Jennings during that time. 
As he had said he would, he had 
gone with the dog, vanishing completely. Now he was back, and the 
bill read as he had told me it 
would: 

GEORGE JENNINGS 
AND HIS WONDER DOG, 
SOCRATES 



I went in and bought a seat in 
the front row. There were some 
knockabout comedians fooling together on the stage; and after them 
a team of rather tired-looking acrobats. Jennings was the third in appearance. He strode on to a fanfare 
of trumpets, and behind him loped 
Socrates. 

He was bigger and his rough, tan 
coat was shaggier than ever. His 
head was more in proportion to his 
body, too, but it was still huge. He 
looked nearer to a St. Bernard than 
any breed I could think of, but he 
was very little like a St. Bernard. 
He was just Socrates, with the same 
blue eyes blazing that had surprised 
me that afternoon four months before. 

Jennings had taught him tricks, 
all right. As they reached the center 
of the stage, Socrates staggered up 
on to his hind legs, waddled to the 
footlights and saluted the audience. 
He swung effortlessly from the 
trapezes the acrobats had left, 
spelled out words in reply to 
Jennings' questions, pulling alphabet blocks forward with his teeth. 
He went through all the repertoire 
that trick dogs usually follow, capping them with an assurance that 
made the audience watch in respectful silence. But when he left, walking stiffly off the stage, the ovation 
was tremendous. They came back 
half a dozen times for encores, 
Socrates saluting gravely each time 
the mob of hysterical humans before him. When they had left for 



SOCRATES 



the last time, I walked out, too. 

I bribed the doorman to let me 
know the name of Jennings' hotel. 
He wasn't staying with the rest of 
the music-hall people but by himself in the Grand. I walked over 
there late in the evening, and had 
my name sent up. The small, 
grubby page boy came back in a few 
minutes. 

"Mr. Jennings says you're to go 
right up," he told me, and added 
the floor and room number. 

T KNOCKED and heard JenJ- nings' voice answer, "Come in !" 

He seemed more prosperous than 
the Jennings I had known, but 
there was the same shifty look about 
him. He was sitting in front of the 
fire wearing an expensive blue-andgold dressing gown, and as I entered the room he poured himself 
whisky from a decanter. I noticed 
that his hand shook slightly. 

"Why," he said thickly, "if it 
isn't the professor! Always a 
pleasure to see old friends. Have a 
drink, Professor." 

He helped me to whisky. 

"Here's to you. Professor," he 
said, "and to Socrates, the Wonder 
Dog!" 

I said, "Can I see him?" 

He grinned. "Any time you like. 
Socrates !" 

A door pushed open and Socrates 
walked in, magnificent in his bearing and in the broad, intelligent 
face from which those blue eyes 
looked out. He advanced to Jen


nings' chair and dropped into 
immobility, head couched between 
powerful paws. 

"You seen our show?" Jennings 
asked. 

I nodded. 

"Great, isn't it? But it's only the 
beginning. We're going to show 
them! Socrates, do the new trick." 

Socrates jumped up and left the 
room, returning a moment later 
pulling a small wooden go-cart, 
gripping a rope attached to it in 
his teeth. I noticed that the cart had 
a primitive pedal arrangement near 
the front, fixed to the front wheels. 
Socrates suddenly leaped into the 
cart, and, moving the pedals with 
his paws, propelled himself along 
the room. As he reached the wall, 
the cart swerved and I noticed that 
his tail worked a rudderlike arrangement for steering. He went 
the reverse length of the room and 
turned again, but this time failed 
to allow enough clearance. The cart 
hit the side wall and Socrates 
toppled off. 

Jennings rose to his feet in an instant. He snatched a whip from the 
wall, and, while Socrates cowered, 
thrashed him viciously, cursing him 
all the time for his failure. 

I jumped forward and grappled 
with Jennings. At last I got the 
whip away from him and he fell 
back exhausted in the chair and 
reached for the whisky decanter. 

I said angrily, "You madman ! Is 
this how you train the dog?" 

He looked up at me over his 



90 




 



whisky glass. "Yes," he said, "this 
is my way of training him! A dog's 
got to learn respect for his master. He doesn't understand anything but the whip. Socrates!" 

He lifted his whip hand, and 
the dog cowered down. 

"I've trained him," he went on. 
"'He's going to be the finest performing dog in the world before 
I'm through." 

I said, "Look, Jennings, I'm not 
a rich man, but I've got friends 
who will advance me money. I'll 
get you a thousand pounds for 
Socrates." 

HE SNEERED. "So you want to 
cash in on the theaters, too?" 
"I promise that if you sell 
Socrates to me, he will never be 
used for profit by anyone." 

He laughed. "A hell of a lot I 
care what would happen to him if 
I sold him. But I'm not selling; 
not for a penny under £20,000. 
Why, the dog's a gold mine." 

"You are determined about 
that?" I asked. 

He got up again. "I'll get you 
the advance bills for our next engagement," he said. "Top billing 
already! Hang on; they-'re only next 
door." 

He walked out unsteadily. I 
looked down to where Socrates lay, 
watching everything in the way 
that had fascinated me when he 
was a pup. I called to him softly: 

"Socrates." 

He pricked up his ears. I felt 



crazy, but I had to do it. I whispered to him: 

"Socrates, follow me back as 
soon as you can get away. Here, 
take the scent from my coat." 

I held my sleeve out to him, and 
he sniffed it. He wagged his huge, 
bushy tail slowly. Then Jennings 
was back with his billheads, and I 
made my excuses and left. 

I walked back — a matter of two 
or three miles. The more I 
thought, the more insane did it 
seem that the dog could have heeded and understood my message. It 
had been an irrational impulse. 

I had found new accommodation 
in the months since Jennings' disappearance; in a cottage with a 
friendly, old couple. I had brought 
Tess, my own golden retriever, 
from home, and they both adored 
her. She was sitting on the inside 
window ledge as I walked slowly 
up the garden path, and her barks 
brought old Mrs. Dobby to the 
door to let me in. Tess came bouncing to meet me and her silky paws 
were flung up toward my chest. I 
patted and stroked her into cjuietness and, after washing, settled 
down to a pleasant tea. 

Two or three hours later, the 
Dobbys having gone to bed, I was 
sitting reading by the fire when I 
heard a voice at the door. 

I called, "Who's there?" 

This time it was a little more 
distinct, though still garbled, as 
though by a person with a faulty 
palate. I heard, "Socrates." 



SOCRATES 



91 



I threw the door open quickly. 
Socrates stood there, eyes gleaming, 
tail alert. I looked beyond him into 
the shadows. 

"Who's brought you, old chap?" 
I asked. 

Socrates looked up. His powerful 
jaws opened. I could see teeth 
gleaming whitely. 

Socrates said, slurring the words, 
but intelligible, "Me. Can speak." 

I BROUGHT him in, shelving 
my incredulity. Sitting in the 
Dobbys' cosy room in front of a 
glowing fire, it seemed more fantastic than ever. Half to myself, I 
said, "I can't believe it." 

Socrates had sat down on the 
rug. "True, though," he said. 
I asked, "Does Jennings know?" 
Socrates replied, "No. Have told 
no one else. Would only make into 
tricks." 

"But Jennings knows you can 
hear and understand things?" 

"Yes. Could not hide. Jennings 
whips until I learn. Easier to learn 
at once." 

His voice, a kind of low, articulate growling, became more readily 
understandable as I listened to it. 
After a few minutes it did not 
seem at all strange that I was sitting by the lire talking to a halfgrown but large mongrel dog. He 
told me how he had practiced human speech by himself, forcing his 
throat to adapt itself to the complexities, succeeding through a 
long process of trial and error. 



I said, in amazement, "But, 
Socrates, you are barely four 
months old!" 

His brow wrinkled. "Yes. 
Strange. Everything goes so fast for 
me. Big . . . old . . ." 

"Maturity," I supplied. "Of 
course there have been 'talking 
dogs' before, but they were just 
stunts, no real intelligence. Do you 
realize what a phenomenon you are, 
Socrates?" 

The vast canine face seemed to 
smile. "How- not realize?" he 
asked. "All other dogs — such fools. 
Why that, Professor?" 

I told him of his birth. He 
seemed to grasp the idea of X-ray 
mutation very easily. I suppose one 
can always swallow the facts of 
one's own existence. He remembered very little of that first month 
of infancy. When I told him of the 
fate of the rest of his litter, he was 
saddened. 

"Perhaps best not to know that," 
he said. "Sad to think I might have 
had brothers and sisters like me. 
Not to be always a trick dog." 

"You don't need to be a trick 
dog, Socrates," I said. "Look, 
we'll go away. I've got friends who 
will help. You need never see 
Jennings again." 

Socrates said, "No. Not possible. 
Jennings the master. I must go 
back." 

"But he beats you! He may beat 
you for going out now." 

"He will," Socrates said. "But 
worth it to come see you." 



92 




 



"Look, Socrates," I said. "Jennings isn't your master. No free 
intelligence should be a slave to 
another. Your intelligence is much 
more advanced than Jennings'." 

The big head shook. "For men, 
all right. Dogs different." 

"But you aren't even Jennings' 
dog," I said. I told him the story 
of Jennings' trickery; how he had 
sold Socrates to me and then refused to acknowledge the sale. 
Socrates was not impressed. 

"Always Jennings' dog," he 
said. "Not remember anything else. 
Must go back. You not dog — not 
understand." 

I said half-heartedly, "We 
would have a fine time, Socrates. 
You could learn all sorts of things. 
And be free, completely free." 

But I knew it was no use. 
Socrates, as he said, was still a 
dog, even though an intelligent 
one, and the thousands of years of 
instinctive slavery to a human master had not been quenched by the 
light that brought intelligence and 
reasoning to his brain. 

He said, "Will come here to 
learn. Will get away often." 

"And be beaten by Jennings 
every time you go back?" 

Socrates shivered convulsively. 
"Yes," he said. "Worth it. Worth 
it to learn things. You teach?" 

"I'll teach you anything I can, 
Socrates," I promised. 

"Can mutate more dogs like 
me?" 

I hated to say it. "No, Socrates. 



You were a fluke, an accident. 
X-rays make monsters; once in a 
million, million times, perhaps, 
something like you happens." 

The bushy tail drooped disconsolately. The huge head rested a 
moment between his paws. Then he 
stood up, four-legged, an outcast. 

"Must go now. Will come again 
soon." 

I let him out and saw him lope 
away into the night. I turned back 
into the warm firelit room. I 
thought of Socrates, running back 
through the night to Jennings' whip 
and I knew what anger and despair 
were. 

SOCRATES came quite frequently after that. He would sit in 
front of me while I read to him 
from books. At first he wanted to 
be taught to read for himself, but 
the difficulty of turning pages with 
his clumsy paws discouraged him. 
I read to him from all the books he 
wanted. 

His appetite was voracious, but 
lay chiefly along non-technical 
lines; naturally enough, in view of 
the impossibility of his ever being 
able to do even the simplest manual 
experiments. Philosophy interested 
him, and I found my own education improving with Socrates' as he 
led me deeper and deeper into 
mazes of idealism, epistemology and 
sublincation. He enjoyed poetry, 
too, and composed a few rough 
poems, which had the merit of a 
strange non-human approach. But 



SOCRATES 



he would not let me write them 
down; now I can remember only a 
few isolated lines. 

His most intense interest was in 
an unexpected field. I mentioned 
casually one day some new development in psychical research, and his 
mind fastened on the subject immediately. He told me he could see 
all sorts of queer things which he 
knew humans could at the best sense 
only vaguely. He spent nearly an 
hour one evening describing to me 
the movements of a strange spiralshaped thing that, he said, was 
spinning around slowly in one corner of my room, now and then increasing and decreasing in size and 
making sudden jumps. I walked 
over to the place he indicated and 
put my hand through vacancy. 

"Can hear it, too,'* Socrates said. 
"High, sweet noise." 

"Some people have unusual 
senses and report similar things," I 
told him. 

He made me read through every 
book I could find on paranormal 
phenomena, in search of explanations of the oddities that surrounded him, but they annoyed him. 

"So many fools," he said wearily, 
when we put down one book that 
had painstakingly linked up poltergeists with angels. "They did not 
see. They only wanted to. They 
thought they did." 

The Dobbys were a little curious 
at my new habit of reading aloud 
in my room, and once I saw them 
glancing suspiciously at Socrates 



when lie changed his speech into a 
growl as they came into the house 
from the garden. But they accepted 
his strange appearances and disappearances quite easily, and always 
made a fuss of him when he happened to turn up during my absence. 

WE DID not always read. At 
times we would go out into 
the fields, and he and Tess would 
disappear in search of rabbits and 
birds and all the other things that 
fascinate dogs in the country. I 
would see them a field away, breasting the wind together. Socrates badly needed such outings. Jennings 
rarely took him out, and, as Socrates spent all the time he could 
filch from Jennings' training activities with me, he saw no other dogs 
and had no other exercise. Tess was 
very fond of him and sometimes 
whined when we shut her out from 
ray room, in order to read and talk 
undisturbed. I asked Socrates about 
her once. 

He said, "Imagine all dogs intelligent; all men fools. You the 
only intelligent man. You talk to 
dogs, but you not like pretty women, even though they are fools?" 

Then, for months, Socrates disappeared, and I learned that Jennings was touring the nojth of 
England, having a sensational success. I saw also the announcement 
that he was to return to Barcaster 
for a fortnight early in November. 
I waited patiently. On the morn



 



ing before he was due to open, 
Socrates returned. 

He was looking as fit as ever 
physically, but mentally the tour 
had been a strain for him. In 
philosophy he had always inclined 
to defeatism, but it had been defeat 
with a sense of glory. He had reveled in Stapledon's works, and 
drawn interesting comparisons between himself and Stapledon's wonder sheepdog. Now, however, there 
was a listlessncss about him that 
made his defeatism a drab and unhappy thing. He would not read 
philosophy, but lay silent while I 
read poetry to him. 

JENNINGS, I discovered, had 
steadily increased his bouts of 
drunkenness. Socrates told me that 
he had to carry the act by himself 
now; Jennings was generally too 
drunk to give even the most elementary instructions on the stage. 

And, of course, with the drunkenness came the whippings. There 
were nasty scars on the dog's back. 
I treated them as well as I could, 
but increasingly I hated and dreaded the time when he would say, 
"Must go now," and I would sec 
him lope off, tail low, to face 
Jennings' drunken fury. 

I remonstrated with him again, 
begging him to come away with me, 
but it was beyond reason. The centuries of slavery could not be eradicated. He afways went back to 
Jennings. 

Then he came one afternoon. It 



had been raining for' days, and he 
was wet through. He would not 
stay in front of the lire to dry. The 
rain was slackening a little. I took 
my raincoat, and, with Tess frisking 
beside us, we set out. We walked 
on in silence. Even Tess grew subdued. 

At last, Socrates said, "Can't go 
on for long. Whipped me again 
last night. Felt something burn my 
mind. Almost tore his throat out. 
I will do it soon and they will shoot 
me." 

"They won't shoot you," I said. 
"You come to me. You will be all 
right. Come now, Socrates. Surely 
you don't want to go on serving 
Jennings when you know you may 
have to kill him?" 

He shivered, and the raindrops 
ran off his shaggy back. 

"Talking no good," he said. "I 
must go back. And if he whips me 
too much, I must kill him. I will 
be shot. Best that way." 

We had reached the river. I 
paused on the bridge that spanned 
it a few inches above the swirling 
currents of the flood, and looked 
out. The river was high after the 
rain, running even more swiftly 
than it usually did. Less than a 
quarter of a mile away was the fall, 
where the water cascaded over the 
brink into a raging turmoil below. 
I was looking at it abstractedly 
when I heard Jennings' voice. 

He stood at the other end of the 
bridge. He was raging drunk. 

He called, "So there you are! 



SOCRATES 



■J5 



And that's what you've been up 
to — sneaking off to visit the professor. I thought I might catch you 
here." 

He advanced menacingly up the 
bridge. "What you need, my lad, 
is a taste of the whip." 

He was bran d i sh ing it as he 
walked. I waited until he had al


away, staggered, fell — and disappeared into the violently flowing 

river. 

I saw his face appear a few 
yards down. He screamed and went 
under again. I turned to Socrates. 

"It's all over," I said. "You are 
free. Come home, Socrates." 

The head appeared again, and 




most reached the place where Socrates was cowering on the boards, 
waiting for the blow, and then I 
charged him savagely. He fought 
for a moment, but I was sober and 
he was not. I caught one of his legs 
and twisted. He pulled viciously 



screamed more faintly. Socrates 
stirred. He called to Jennings for 
the first and last time: 
"Master!" 

Then he was over the bridge and 
swimming down frantically toward 
the drowning man. I called after 




 



him, but he took no notice. I 
thought of jumping in myself, but 
I knew I could not last even to 
reach him. With Tess at my heels, 
I raced round the bank to the place 
where the water roared over the 
fall. 

I saw them just as they reached 
the fall. Socrates had reached him, 
and was gripping the coat in his 
teeth. He tried to make for the 
bank, but there was no chance. 
They swept over the edge and into 
the fury below. I watched for their 
reappearance for some time, but 
they did not come up. 

They never came up. 

I think sometimes of the things 
Socrates might have done if he had 
been given the chance. If only for 
those queer things he saw that we 



cannot see, his contribution to 
knowledge would have been tremendous. And when I think that he 
was less than a year old when he 
died, the lost possibilities awe and 
sadden me. 

I cannot escape the conclusion 
that at his full maturity he would 
have outstripped all the specialists 
in the strange fields he might have 
chosen to work in. 

There is just one thing that worries me still. His was a true mutation; the identical litter showed 
that. But was it a dominant one? 
Could the strength and vigor of his 
intelligence rise above the ordinary 
traits of an ordinary dog? It's a 
point that means a great deal. 

Tess is going to have pups.

Conclusion of a 3'Pcrt Serial 




Illustrated by JOHN BUNCH 



SYNOPSIS 

TJIRON FARRILL, having es-O aped a death trap on Earth, 
where he was completing bis college education, learns from Sander 
jonti, who, like Biron, is a native 
of the Nebular Kingdoms of the 
Galaxy, that the elder Farrill, Biron's father, has been captured and 
probably executed by the Tyranni. 
The Tyranni are natives of the planet Tyrann, and, fifty years earlier, 
had conquered nil the Nebular 
Kingdoms. 

Biron leaves Earth under an assumed identity, but the attempted 



imposture fails, and upon arrival on 
Rhodia, the largest planet of the 
Nebular Kingdoms, is delivered to 
the wily Simok Aralap, Tyrannian 
Commissioner of the Region. 

Meanwhile, Sander Jonti has 
been searching for a mysterious document said to date back to the preatomic age on Earth, for which Biron had earlier been searching on 
behalf of his father, and the possession of which is supposed to be 
vital for the success of the conspiracy against Tyrann. He finds 
that the document has been stolen 
from the Earth's archives twenty 
years before.. 



TYRANN 



99 



On Rhodia. Aratap releases Biton, although aware of his identity, 
in order to trace, through him, the 
larger threads of the conspiracy. 
Biron approaches Hinrik. Director 
of Rhodia, who is a tool of the Tyranni, and who, instead of responding to Biron's plea for help, decides 
that he has been sent merely as a 
test of his own loyalty to Tyrann, 
and therefore orders Biron's arrest 
and re-delivery to Aratap. 

Biron escapes from the palace 
with the help of Gillbret, Hinrik's 
cousin, who hales the Tyranni, and 
Artemisia, Hinrik's daughter, who 
is faced with a possible marriage 
of state with an elderly Tyrannian 
nobleman and can't abide the 
thought. The three steal Aratap's 
own space-yacht and escape into 
space. They are not aware of the 
fact that Tyranni ships are equipped 
with devices which enable them to 
maintain contact with one another 
through cosmic distances. Aratap, 
still intent on giving Biron enough 
rope, follows, without making any 
immediate attempt to capture them. 

On the space-yacht, meanwhile, 
Gillbret tells Biron and Artemisia 
that twenty years earlier, he had 
been stranded in space through an 
accident and come across a hidden 
world secretly organizing a military 
power for use against the Tyranni. 
He believes the organizer of this 
"Rebellion World" to be the Autarch of Lingane, an outlying world 
of the Nebular Kingdoms, never 
fully conquered by the Tyranni. 



They head for Lingane. During the 
trip. Biron and Artemisia find themselves falling in love. 

At Lingane, they contact the Autarch, who boards their ship. The 
Autarch turns out to be Sander 
Jonti. Biron is furious. He has reason to suspect that the original 
death trap on Earth was set by Jonti 
himself, rather than by J he Tyranni. 
Jonti admits this and explains that 
he did so in order to send Biron to 
the Nebular Kingdoms as a decoy 
in order to divert suspicion from 
the real conspiracy. He asks for custody of Artemisia, and, when Biron 
refuses, tells him that Biron's father was executed as a result of information given the Tyranni by 
Hinrik of Rfjodia. 

Jonti also informs them that he 
is not the organizer of the "Rebellion World," but that he, too, is 
anxious to find it. From Gillbret' s 
story, he has deduced that it can 
exist only near one of five possible 
stars within the Horsehead Nebula 
itself. 

He proposes that they enter the 
Nebula in order to investigate the 
five stars, one by one. 

Meanwhile, Biron and Artemisia 
have been estranged because of Jonti' s information that her father bad 
betrayed Biron's father to execution by the 'Tyranni. 

Closely behind them, and unknown to them, the Tyranni fleet, 
under Aratap and Hinrik, are in 
pursuit. 

The story concludes:

CHAPTER XV 

The Hole in Space 

TEDOR RIZZETT turned as 
Biron entered the pilot room 
again. His hair was gray, but 
his body was still vigorous and his 
face was broad, red, and smiling. 

He covered the distance between 
himself and Biron in a stride and 
seized the young man's hand heart
%■ 

"By the stars," he said, "I'd need 
no word from you to tell me that 
you are your father's son. It is the 
old Rancher alive again." 

"I wish it were," said Biron, 
somberly. 

Rizzett's smile faltered. "So do 
we all. Every one of us. I'm Tedor 
Rizzett, by the way. I'm a colonel in 
the regular Linganian forces, but 
we don't use titles in our own little 
game. We even say merely 'sir' to 
the Autarch. That reminds me." He 
looked grave. "We don't have 
Lords and Ladies or even Ranchers 
on Lingane. I hope I won't offend 
if I forget to throw in the proper 
title sometimes." 

Biron shrugged. "As you said, 
no titles in our little game. But 
what about the trailer? I'm to make 
arrangements with you, I take it." 

For a flickering moment, he 
looked across the room. Gillbret 
was seated, quietly listening. Artenisia had her back to him. Her slim, 
pale fingers wove an abstracted 
pattern on the photo-contacts of the 

TYRANN 



computer. Rizzett's voice brought 
him back. 

The Linganian had cast an allinclusive glance about the room. 
"First time I've ever seen a Tyrannian vessel from the inside. Don't 
care much for it. Now you've got 
the emergency airlock due astern, 
haven't you? It seems to me the 
power- thrusters girdle the mid-section." 

"That's right." 

"Good. Then there won't be any 
trouble. Some of the old model 
ships have power- thrusters due 
astern, so that trailers had to be set 
off at an angle. This makes the 
gravity adjustment difficult and the 
maneuverability in atmospheres just 
about nil." 

"How long will it take, Rizzett?" 

"Not long. How big would you 
want it?" 

"How big could you get it?" 

"Super-de-luxe? Sure. If the Autarch says so, there's no higher priority. We can get one that's 
practically a spaceship in itself. It 
would even have its own auxiliary 
motors." 

"It would have living quarters, 
I suppose." 

"For Miss Hinriad? It would be 
considerably better than you have 
here." 

At the mention of her name, Artemisia had drifted past coldly and 
slowly, moving out of the pilot 
room. Biron's eyes followed her. 

Rizzett said, "I guess I shouldn't 
have said Miss Hinriad." 

101 



"It's nothing. Pay no attention. 
You were saying?" 

"Oh, about the rooms. At least 
two sizable ones, with a communicating shower. It's got the usual 
closet room and plumbing arrangements of the big liners. She would 
be comfortable." 

"Good. We'll need food and water." 

"Sure. Water tank will hold a 
two months' supply; a little less if 
you want to arrange for a swimming pool aboard ship. And you 
would have frozen whole meats. 
You're eating Tyranni concentrate 
now, aren't you?" 

Biron nodded and Rizzett grimaced. "It tastes like chopped sawdust, doesn't it ? Want anything 
else?" 

"A supply of clothes for the 
lady," said -Biron. 

Rizzett wrinkled his forehead. 
"Yes, of course. Well, that will be 
her job." 

"It won't. We'll supply you with 
all necessary measurements, and you 
can supply us with whatever we ask 
for in whatever the current styles 
happen to be." 

Rizzett laughed shortly and shook 
his head. "Rancher, she won't like 
that. She wouldn't be satisfied with 
any clothes she didn't pick. Not 
even if they were the identical items 
she would have picked if she had 
been given- the chance. This isn't 
a guess, now. I've had experience 
with the creatures." 

Biron said, "I'm sure you're 



right, Rizzett, but that's the way it 
will have to be." 

"Well, don't say I didn't warn 
you. It will be your argument. 
What else?" 

"Little things. A supply of detergents. Oh, yes, and cosmetics, 
perfume, the things women need. 
We'll make the arrangements in 
time. Let's get the trailer started." 

And now Gillbret was leaving 
without speaking. Biron's eyes followed him, too, and he felt his jawmuscles tighten. Hinriads! Gillbret 
was one and she was another. 

He said, "And, of course, there'll 
be clothes for Mr. Hinriad and 
myself. They're not important." 

"Right! Mind if I use your 
radio? I'd" better stay on this ship 
till the adjustments are made." 

BIRON waited, while the orders went out. Then Rizzett 
turned on the seat and said, "I 
can't get used to seeing you here, 
moving, talking, alive. You're so 
like him. The Rancher used to 
speak about you every once in a 
while. You went to school on 
Earth, didn't you?" 

"I did. I would have graduated 
a little over a week ago, if things 
hadn't been interrupted." 

Rizzett looked uncomfortable. 
"Look, about your being sent to 
Rhodia the way you were. You 
mustn't hold it against us. We 
didn't like it. I mean, this is strictly between us, but some of the 
boys didn't like it at all. The Au


102 




 



tarch didn't consult us, of course. 
You couldn't expect him to. Frankly, it was a risk on his part. Some 
of us — I'm not mentioning names 
— even wondered if we shouldn't 
stop the liner you were on and 
take you off. Naturally, that would 
have been the worst thing we could 
possibly do. Still, we might have 
done it, excejjt that in the last 
analysis we knew the Autarch must 
know what he was doing." 

<<TT'S nice to be able to inspire 

X that kind of confidence." 

"We know him. There's no 
denying it, he's got it here." He 
slowly tapped his forehead. "Nobody knows exactly what makes 
him take a certain course sometimes, yet it always seems the right 
one. At least he's outsmarted the 
Tyranni so far and others don't." 

"Like my father, for instance." 

"I wasn't thinking of him, exactly, but, in a sense, you're right. 
Even the Rancher was caught. 
Well, he was a different kind of 
man. His way of thinking was 
straight. He would never allow for 
crookedness. He would always underestimate the worthlessness of 
the next man. But then again, that 
was what we liked best, somehow. 
He was the same to everyone. 

"I'm a commoner, for all I'm a 
colonel. My father was a metalworker, you see. It didn't make any 
difference to the Rancher. And it 
wasn't that I was a colonel, either. 
If he met the engineer's apprentice 



walking down the corridor, he'd 
step aside, and say a pleasant word 
or two, and, for the rest of the 
day, the apprentice would feel like 
a Master Engineman. It was the 
way the Rancher had. 

"Not that he was soft. If you 
needed disciplining, you got it, but 
no more than your share. What 
you got, you deserved, and you 
knew it. When he was through, he 
was through. He didn't keep throwing it at you at odd moments for 
a week or so. That was the 
Rancher. 

"Now the Autarch, he's different. He's pure brains. You can't 
get next to him, no matter who 
you are. For instance, he doesn't 
really have a sense of humor. I 
can't speak to him the way I'm 
speaking to you. Right now I'm 
just talking. I'm relaxed. It's almost free association. With him, 
you say exactly what's on your 
mind with no spare words. And 
you use formal phraseology, or 
he'll tell you you're slovenly. But 
then, the Autarch's the Autarch, 
and that's that." 

Biron said, "I'll have to agree 
with you as far as the Autarch's 
brains are concerned. Did you 
know that he had deduced my presence aboard this ship, before he 
ever got on?" 

"He did? We didn't know that. 
Now, there, that's what I mean. 
He was going to go aboard the 
Tyrannian cruiser alone. To us, it 
seemed suicide. We didn't like it. 



TYIANN 



103 



But we assumed he knew what he 
was doing, and he did. He could 
have told us you were probably 
aboard ship. He must have known 
it would be great news that the 
Rancher's son had escaped. But it's 
typical. He wouldn't." 

ARTEMISIA sat on one of the 
lower bunks in the cabin. She 
had to bend into an uncomfortable 
position to avoid having the frame 
of the second bunk pry into her 
first thoracic vertebra, but that was 
a small annoyance to her at the 
moment. 

Almost automatically, she kept 
passing the palms of her hand 
down the side of her dress. She 
felt frayed and dirty, and very 
tired. She was tired of dabbing at 
her hands and face with damp 
cloths. She was tired of wearing the 
same clothes for a week. She was 
tired of hair which felt dank and 
stringy by now. 

And then she was almost on her 
feet again, ready^ to turn about 
sharply. She wasn't going to see 
him. She wouldn't look at him. 

But it was only Gillbret. She 
sank down again. "Hello, Uncle 
Gil." 

Gillbret sat down opposite her. 
For a moment, his thin face 
seemed anxious and then it started 
wrinkling into a smile. "I think a 
week of this ship is very unamusing, too. I was hoping you could 
cheer me up." 

But she said, "Now, Uncle Gil, 



don't start using psychology on me. 
If you think you're going to cajole 
me into feeling a responsibility for 
you, you're wrong. I'm much more 
likely to hit you." 

"If it will make you feel 
better — " 

"I warn you again. If you hold 
out your face for me to hit, I'll do 
it, and if you say 'Does that make 
you feel better?' tu do it again." 

"In any case, it's obvious you've 
quarreled with Biron. What 
about?" 

"I don't see why there's any 
necessity for discussion. Just leave 
me alone. " Then, after a pause, 
"He thinks father did what the 
Autarch said he did. I hate him 
for that." 

"Your father?" 

"No! That stupid, childish, sanctimonious fool!" 

"Presumably Biron. Good. You 
hate him. You couldn't put a knifeedge between what you say is hate 
and what would seem to my 
bachelor mind to be a rather ridiculous excess of love." 

"Uncle Gil," she said, "could he 
really have done it?" 

"Biron? Done what?" 

"No! Father. Could father have 
informed against the Rancher?" 

Gillbret looked thoughtful and 
very sober. "I don't know." He 
looked at her out of the corner of 
his eyes. "He did give up Biron to 
the Tyranni." 

"Because he knew it was a 
trap," she said, vehemently. "And 



104 




 



it was. That horrible Autarch meant 
it as such. He said so. The Tyranni 
knew who Biron was and sent him 
to father on purpose. Father did 
the only thing he could do. That 
should be obvious to anybody." 

"Even if we accept that, he did 
try to argue you into a rather unamusing kind of marriage." 

She interrupted, "He had no 
way out there, either." 

"My dear, if you're going to excuse all that, how can you be sure 
he didn't betray the Rancher?" 

"Because I'm sure, that's why. 
You don't know father the way I 
do. He hates the Tyranni. He does. 
I admit that he's afraid of them 
and doesn't dare oppose them openly, but if he could avoid it somehow, he would never help them." 

"How do you know he could 
avoid it?" 

But she shook her head violently, so that her hair tumbled about 
and hid her eyes. It hid the tears 
a bit, too. 

Gillbret watched a moment, then 
spread his hands helplessly and 
left. 

THE trailer was joined to the 
Remorseless by a wasp-waist 
corridor attached to the emergency 
airlock in the rear of the ship. It 
was several dozen times larger than 
the Tyrannian vessel, almost humorously outsized. 

The Autarch joined Biron in a 
last inspection. He said, "Do you 
find anything lacking?" 



Biron said, "No. I think we'll 
be quite comfortable." 

"Good. And, by the way, Rizzett tells me the lady Artemisia is 
not well; or at least that she looks 
unwell. If she requires medical attention, it might be wise to send 
her to my ship." 

"She is quite well," said Biron, 
curtly. 

"If you say so. Would you be 
ready to leave in twelve hours?" 

"In two hours, if you wish." 

Biron passed through the connecting corridor — he had to stoop 
a little — into the Remorseless 
proper. 

He said with a careful lack of 
tone, "You've got a private suite 
back there, Artemisia. I won't 
bother you. I'll stay here most of 
the time." 

She replied coldly, "You don't 
bother me, Rancher. It doesn't matter to me where you are." 

And then the ships blasted off 
and after a single Jump found 
themselves at the edge of the Nebula. They waited for a few hours 
while the final calculations were 
made on Jonti's ship. Inside the 
Nebula, it would be almost blind 
navigation. 

Biron stared glumly at the visiplate. There was nothing there ! 
One entire half of the celestial 
sphere was taken up with blackness, unrelieved by a spark of light. 
For the first time, Biron realized 
how warm and friendly the stars 
were, how they filled space. 



TYRANN 



105 



"It's like dropping through a 
hole in space," he muttered to Gillbret. 

And then they Jumped again, 
this time into the Nebula. 

Almost simultaneously, Simok 
Aratap, Commissioner of the Great 
Khan, at the head of ten armed 
cruisers, listened to his navigator 
and said, "That doesn't matter. 
Follow them anyway." 

And not one light year from the 
point at which the Remorseless entered the Nebula, ten Tyranni 
vessels did likewise. 

CHAPTER XVI 

Hounds! 

SIMOK ARATAP was a little 
uncomfortable in his uniform. 
Tyranni uniforms are made of moderately coarse materials and fit only 
indifferently well. It is not soldierlike to complain of such inconveniences. In fact, it is part of the 
Tyranni military tradition that a 
little discomfort on the part of the 
soldier is good for discipline. 

But still Aratap could bring himself to rebel against that tradition 
to the extent of saying, ruefully, 
"The tight collar irritates my 
neck." 

Major Andros, whose collar was 
as tight and who had been seen in 
no other than military dress in the 
memory of living man, said, 
"When alone, it would be quite 
within regulations to open it. Be


fore any of the officers or men, 
any deviation from regulation dress 
would be a disturbing influence." 

Aratap sniffed. It wis the second 
change induced by the quasi-military nature of the expedition. In 
addition to being forced into uniform, he had to listen to an increasingly self-assertive military aide. 
That had begun even before they 
left Rhodia. 

Andros had put it to him baldly. 
He had said, "Commissioner, we 
will need ten ships." 

Aratap had looked up, definitely 
annoyed. At the moment, he was 
deciding to follow the young 
Widemos in a single vessel. He 
laid aside the capsules in which he 
was preparing his report for the 
Khan's Colonial Bureau, to be forwarded in the unhappy case that 
he did not return from the expedition. 

"Ten ships, Major?" 

"Yes, sir. Less will not do." 

"Why not?" 

"I intend to maintain a reasonable security. The young man is 
going somewhere. You say there 
is a well-developed conspiracy in 
existence. Presumably, the two fit 
together." 

"And therefore?" 

"We must be prepared for a * 
possibly well-developed conspiracy. 
One that might be able to overcome a single ship." 

"Or ten. Or a hundred. Where 
docs security cease?" 

"One must make a decision. In 



106 




 



cases of military action, it is my 
responsibility. I suggest ten." 

Aratap's contact lenses gleamed 
unnaturally in the wall-light as he 
raised his eyebrows. The military 
carried weight. Theoretically, in 
times of peace, the civilian made 
the decisions, but, here again, military tradition was a difficult tiling 
to set aside. 

HE SAID, cautiously, "I will 
consider the matter." 
"Thank you. If you do not 
choose to accept my recommendations, and my suggestions have only 
been advanced as such, I assure you, 
that would be your privilege. You 
would leave me, however, no choice 
but to resign my commission." 

It was up to Aratap to retrieve 
what he could from that position. 
He said, "It is not my intention to 
hamper you in any decision you 
may make on a purely military 
question. Major. I wonder if you 
might be as amenable to my decisions in matters of purely political importance." 

"What matters are these?" 
"There is the problem of Hinrik. You objected yesterday to my 
suggestion that he accompany us." 

The Major said, dryly, "I consider it unnecessary. With our 
forces in action, the presence of 
outlanders would be bad for morale." 

Aratap sighed softly, just below 
the limits of hearing. Yet Andros 
was a competent man in his way. 



There would be no use in displaying impatience. 

He said, "Again, I agree with 
you. I merely ask you to consider 
the political aspects of the situation. 
As you know, the execution of the 
old Rancher of Widemos was politically uncomfortable. It stirred 
up the Kingdoms unnecessarily. 
However necessary the execution 
was, it makes it desirable to refrain 
from having the death of the son 
attributed to us. As far as the people of Rhodia know, the young 
Widemos has kidnaped the daughter of the Director— the girl, by 
the way, being a popular and much 
publicized member of the Hinriads. It would be quite fitting, 
quite understandable, to have the 
Director head the punitive expedition. 

"It would be a dramatic move, 
very gratifying to Rhodian patriotism. Naturally, he would ask for 
Tyranni assistance, and receive it, 
but that can be played down. It 
would be easy, and necessary, to 
fix this expedition in the popular 
mind as a Rhodian one. If the 
inner workings of the conspiracy 
are uncovered, it will have been a 
Rhodian discovery. If the young 
Widemos is executed, it would be 
a Rhodian execution, as far as the 
other Kingdoms are concerned." 

The Major said, "It would still 
be a bad precedent to allow Rhodian vessels to accompany a Tyranni military expedition. They 
would hamper us in a fight. In 



TYRANN 



107 



that way, the question becomes a 
military one." 

"I did .lot say, my dear Major, 
that Hinrik would command a 
ship. Surely, you know him better 
than to think him capable of commanding or even anxious to try. He 
will stay with us. There will be no 
other Rhodian aboard ship." 

"In that case, I waive my objection, Commissioner," said the 
Major. 

THE Tyranni fleet had maintained their position two light 
years off Lingane for the better part 
of a week and the situation was 
becoming increasingly unstable. 

Major Andros advocated an immediate landing on Lingane. "The 
Autarch of Lingane," he said, "has 
gone to considerable lengths to 
have us think him a friend of the 
Khan, but I do not trust these men 
who travel abroad. They gain unsettling notions. It is strange that 
just as he returns, the young Widemos travels to meet him." 

"He has not tried to hide cither 
his travels or his return, Major. 
And we do not know that Widemos 
goes to meet him. He maintains an 
orbit about Lingane. Why does he 
not land?" 

"Why. docs he maintain an orbit? Let us question what he does 
and not what he does not do." 

"I can propose something which 
will fit the pattern." 

"I would be glad to hear it." 
Aratap placed a .finger inside his 




collar and tried futilely to stretch 
it. He said, "Since the young man 
is waiting, we can presume he is 
waiting for something or somebody. It would be ridiculous to 
think that, having gone to Lingane 
by so direct and rapid a route — a 
single Jump, in fact — that he is 
merely waiting out of indecision. I 
say, then, that he is waiting for a 
friend or friends to reach him. Thus 
reinforced, he will proceed elsewhere. The fact that he is not landing on Lingane directly would 
indicate that he does not consider 
such an action safe. That .would 
indicate that Lingane in general

and the Autarch in particular are 
not concerned in the conspiracy, 
although individual Linganians may 
be." 

"I don't know if we can always 
trust the obvious solution to be the 
correct one." 

"My dear Major, this is not an 
obvious solution, merely. It is a 
logical one. It fits a pattern." 

"Maybe it does. But just the 
same, if there are no further developments in twenty-four hours, I 
will have no choice but to order 
an advance on Lingane." 

Aratap frowned at the door 
through which the Major had left. 

TYRANN 



It was disturbing to have to control at once the restless conquered 
and the short-sighted conquerors. 
Twenty-four hours. Something 
must happen; otherwise he might 
have to find some way of stopping 
Andros. 

The door signal sounded, and 
Aratap looked up with irritation. 
Surely it could not be Andros returning. It wasn't. The tall, stooped 
form of Hinrik of Rhodia was in 
the doorway, behind him a glimpse 
of the guard who accompanied him 
everywhere on the ship. Theoretically, Hinrik had complete freedom of movement. He himself 
probably thought he had. At least, 
lie never paid any attention to the 
guard at his elbow. 

Hinrik smiled mistily. "Am I 
disturbing you, Commissioner?" 

"Not at all. Take a seat, Director." Aratap remained standing. 
Hinrik seemed not to notice that. 

Hinrik said, "I have something 
of importance to discuss with you." 
He paused, and some of the intentness passed out of his eyes. He 
added in quite a different tone, 
"What a large, fine ship this is." 

"Thank you, Director." Aratap 
smiled tightly. The nine accompanying ships were typically minute 
in size, but the flagship on which 
they stood was an outsize model 
adapted from the designs of the 
defunct Rhodian navy. It was perhaps the first sign of the gradual 
softening of the Tyranni military 
spirit that more and more of such 

109 



ships were being added to the 
navy. The fighting unit was still 
the tiny two to three man cruiser, 
but, increasingly, the top brass 
found reasons for requiring large 
ships for their own headquarters. 

It did not bother Aratap. To 
some of the older soldiers this softness appeared to be degeneration; 
to himself it seemed increasing civilization. In the end, in centuries 
perhaps, it might even happen that 
the Tyranni would nielt away as a 
single people, fusing with the present conquered societies of the Nebular Kingdoms — and perhaps even 
that might be a good thing. 

Naturally, Aratap never expressed such an opinion aloud. 

"I came to tell you something," 
said Hinrik. He puzzled over it a 
while, then added, "I have sent a 
message home today to my people. 
I have told them I am well and 
that the criminal will be shortly 
seized and my daughter returned 
to safety." 

"Good," said Aratap. It was not 
news to him. He himself had written the message, though it was 
not impossible that Hinrik by now 
had persuaded himself that he was 
the writer, or even that he actually 
headed the expedition. Aratap felt 
a twinge of pity. The man was disintegrating visibly. 

Hinrik said, "My people, I am 
sure, are quite disturbed over this 
daring raid upon the Palace by these 
well -organized bandits. I think they 
will be proud of their Director now 



that I have taken such rapid action 
in response. Eh, Commissioner? 
They will see that there is still 
force among the Hinriads." He 
seemed filled with a feeble triumph. 

"I think they will," said Aratap. 

"Are we within range of the enemy yet?" 

"No, Director. The enemy remains where he is, just off Lingane." 

"Still? I remember what I came 
to tell you." He grew excited so 
that the words tumbled out. "It is 
very important, Commissioner. I 
have discovered it. We must take 
quick action. Treachery — " He was 
whispering. 

ARATAP felt impatient. It was 
necessary to humor the poor 
idiot, of cou rse, but thi s was a 
waste of time. At this rate, he 
would become so obviously mad 
that he would be useless even as 
a puppet, which would be a nuisance. 

He said, "No treachery, Director. 
Our men are staunch and true. 
Someone has been misleading you. 
You are tired." 

"No, no." Hinrik put aside Aratap's arm which, for a moment, had 
rested upon his shoulder. "Where 
are we?" 

"Why, here!" 

"The ship^I mean. I have watched the visiplate. We are near no 
star. We are in deep space. Did 
you know that?" 

"Why, certainly." 



no 




 



"Lingane is nowhere near. Did 
you know that?" 

"It is two light years off." 

"Ah ! Commissioner, no one is 
listening? Are you sure?" He 
leaned closely, while Aratap allowed his ear to be approached. 
"Then how do we know the enemy 
is near Lingane? He is too far to 
detect. We are being misinformed, 
and this signifies treachery." 

WELL, the man might be mad, 
but the point was a good one. 
Aratap said, "This is something 
for technical men, Director; and not 
for men of rank to concern themselves with." 

"But as head of the expedition I 
should know. I am head, am I 
not?" He looked about carefully. 
"Actually, I have a feeling that Major Andros does not always carry 
out my orders. Is he trustworthy? 
Of course, I rarely give him orders. 
It would seem strange to order a 
Tyrannian officer. But then, I must 
find my daughter. My daughter's 
name is Artemisia. She has been 
stolen from mc, and I am taking all 
this fleet to get her back. So you 
see, I must know. I mean, I must 
know how it is known the enemy 
is at Lingane. My daughter would 
be there, too. Do you know my 
daughter? Her name is Artemisia." 

His eyes looked up at the Tyrannian Commissioner in appeal. Then 
he covered them with his hand and 
mumbled something that sounded 
like, "I'm sorry." 



Aratap felt his jaw-muscles 
clench. It was difficult to remember 
that the man bef ore him was a 
bereaved father and that even the 
idiot Director of Rhodia might 
have a father's feelings. He could 
not let the man suffer. 

He said, gently, "I will try to 
explain. You know there is such a 
thing as a massometer which will 
detect ships in space." 

"Yes, yes." 

"It is sensitive to gravitational 
effects. You know what I mean ?" 

"Oh, yes. Everything has gravity." Hinrik was leaning toward 
Aratap, his hands gripping each 
other nervously. 

"That's good enough. Now naturally the massometer can only be 
used when the ship is close. Less 
than a million miles away or so. 
Also it has to be a reasonable distance from any planet, because if 
it isn't, all you can detect is the 
planet, which is much bigger." 

"And has much more gravity." 

"Exactly," said Aratap, and Hinrik looked pleased. "We Tyranni 
have another device. It is a transmitter which radiates through hypcrspace in all directions, and what 
it radiates is a particular type of 
distortion of the space fabric which 
is not electromagnetic in character. 
In other words, it isn't like light or 
radio or even sub-ctheric radio. Do 
you see?" 

Hinrik didn't answer. He looked 
confused. 

Aratap proceeded quickly. "Well, 



TYRANN 



111 



it's different; it doesn't matter how. 
We can detect that something is 
radiated so that we can always know 
where any Tyrannian ship is, even 
if it's halfway across the Galaxy, or 
on the other side of a star." 

Hinrik nodded solemnly, looking 
vaguely impressed. 

"Now," said Aratap, "if the 
young Widemos had escaped in an 
ordinary ship, it would have been 
very difficult to locate him. As it is, 
since he took a Tyrannian cruiser, 
we know where he is at all times, 
although he doesn't realize that. 
That is how we know he is near 
Lingane, you see. And what's more, 
he can't get away, so that we will 
certainly rescue your daughter." 

HINRIK smiled. "Why, that is 
wonderful, Commissioner. A 
very clever ruse." 

Aratap did not delude himself. 
Hinrik understood very little of 
what he had said, but that did not 
matter. It had ended with the assurance of his daughter's rescue, 
and somewhere in Hinrik's dim understanding there must be the realization that this, somehow, was made 
possible by Tyranni science. 

He told himself that he had not 
gone to this trouble entirely because 
the Rhodian appealed to his sense 
of the pathetic. He had to keep the 
man from breaking down altogether 
for obvious political reasons. Perhaps the return of his daughter 
would improve matters. He hoped 
so. 



There was a sharp door signal 
again and this time it was Major 
Andros who entered. Hinrik's arm 
stiffened on the arm-rest of his chair 
and his face assumed a hunted expression. He lifted himself and began, "Major Andros — " 

But Andros was already speaking 
quickly, disregarding the Rhodian. 
"Commissioner, the. Remorse/ess has 
changed position." 

"Surely he has not landed on 
Lingane," said Aratap, sharply. 

"No," said the Major. "He has 
Jumped away from Lingane." 

"Good. He has been joined by 
another ship, perhaps?" 

"By many ships, perhaps. We can 
detect only his, as you are quite 
aware.'.' 

"In any case, we follow again." 

"The order has already been 
given. I would merely like to point 
out that his Jump has taken him 
to the edge of the Horsehead Nebula." 

"What?" 

"No major planetary system 
exists in the ind icated di rection . 
There is only one logical conclusion." 

Aratap moistened his lips and 
left hurriedly for the pilot room, 
the Major with him. 

Hinrik remained standing in the 
middle of the suddenly empty room, 
looking at the door for a minute or 
so. Then, with a little shrug of the 
shoulders, he sat down again. His 
expression was blank. For a long 
while, he simply sat. 



112 




 



THE navigator said, "The space 
coordinates of the Remorseless 
have been checked, sir. They are 
definitely inside the Nebula." 

"That doesn't matter," said Aratap. 1 ' Fol low them an yway. ' ' He 
turned to Major Andros. "So you 
see the virtues of waiting. There is 
a good deal that is obvious now. 
Where else could the conspirator's 
headquarters be but in the Nebula 
itself? Where else could we have 
failed to locate them? A very pretty 
pattern." 

And so the squadron entered the 
Nebula. 

For the twentieth time, Aratap 
glanced automatically at the visiplate. Actually, the glances were 
useless since the visiplatc remained 
quite black. There was no star in 
sight. 

Andros said, "That's their third 
stop without landing. I don't understand it. What is their purpose? 
What are they after? Each stop of 
theirs is several days long. Yet they 
do not land." 

"It may take them so long," said 
Aratap, "to calculate their next 
Jump. Visibility is non-existent." 

"You think so?" 

"No. Their Jumps are too good. 
Each time they land very near a 
star. They couldn't do as well by 
massometcr data alone, unless they 
actually knew the locations of the 
stars in advance." 

"Then why don't they land?" 

"I think," said Aratap, "they 
must be looking for habitable plan


ets. Maybe they, themselves, do not 
know the location of the center of 
conspiraq 1 . Or, at least, not entirely." He smiled. "We need only follow." 




IHE navigator clicked heels. 
"Sir!" 



"Yes?" Aratap looked up. 
"The enemy has landed on a 
planet." 

Aratap signaled for Major Andros. 

"Andros," said Aratap, as the 
Major entered, "have you been 
told?" 

"Yes. I've ordered a descent and 
pursuit." 

"Wait. You may be again premature, as when you wanted a 
lunge toward Lingane. I think only 
this ship ought to go." 

"Your reasoning?" 

"If we need reinforcements, you 
will be there, in command of the 
cruisers. If it is indeed a powerful 
rebel center, they may think only 
one ship has stumbled upon them. 
I will get word to you somehow 
and you can retire to Tyrann." 

"Retire !" 

"And return with a full fleet." 

Andros considered. "Very well. 
This is our least useful ship in any 
case. Too large." 

The planet filled the visiplate as 
they spiraled down. 

"The surface seems quite barren, 
sir," said the navigator. 

"Have you determined the exact 
location of the Remorseless?" 



TYRANN 



113 



"Yes, sir." 

"Then land as closely as you can 
without being sighted." 

They were entering the atmosphere now. The sky, as they flashed 
along the day-half of the planet, 
was tinged with a brightening purple. Aratap watched the nearing 
surface. The long chase was almost 
over I 

CHAPTER XVII 
And Hares! 

TO THOSE who have not actually been in space, the investigation of a stellar system and the 
search for habitable planets may 
seem rather exciting; at the least, 
interesting. To the spaceman, it is 
the most boring of jobs. 

The location of a star, which is 
a huge glowing mass of hydrogen 
fusing into helium, is almost unavoidable. It advertises itself. Even 
in the blackness of the Nebula, it 
is only a question of distance. Approach within five billion miles and 
it will still advertise itself. 

But a planet, a relatively small 
mass of rock, shining only by reflected light, is another matter. One 
could pass through a stellar system 
a hundred thousand times at all 
sorts of odd angles without" ever 
coming close enough to a planet to 
see it for what it is, barring the 
oddest of coincidences. 

Hence, one adopts a system. A 
position is taken up in space, at a 



distance from the star being investigated, of some ten thousand times 
the star's diameter. From Galactic 
statistics it is known that not one 
time in fifty thousand is a planet 
located farther from its primary 
than that. Furthermore, practically 
never is a habitable planet removed 
from its primary more than one 
thousand times its sun's diameter. 

This means that from the position in space assumed by the ship, 
any habitable planet must be located within six degrees of the 
star. This, represents an area only 
1/ 3600th of the entire sky. That 
area can be handled in detail with 
relatively few observations. 

The movement of the tele-camera 
can be so adjusted as to counteract 
the motion of the ship in its orbit. 
Under those conditions, a time exposure will pinpoint the constellations in the star's neighborhood; 
provided, of course, that the blaze 
of the sun itself is blocked out, 
which is easily done. Planets, however, will have perceptible proper 
motions and therefore show up as 
tiny streaks on the film. 

When no streaks appear, there is 
always the possibility that the 
planets are behind their primary. 
The maneuver is therefore repeated 
from another position in space and, 
usually, at a point closer to the star. 

It is a very dull procedure indeed, and when it has been repeated three times for three different stars, each time with completely negative results, a certain 



114 




 



depression of morale is bound to 
occur. 

GILLBRET'S morale, for instance, had been suffering for 
quite a while. Longer and longer 
intervals took place between the 
moments when he found something "amusing." 

They were readying for the 
Jump to the fourth star on the 
Autarch's list, and Biron said, "We 
hit a star each time, anyway. At 
least, Jonti's figures arc correct." 

Gillbret said, "Statistics show 
that one out of three stars have 
planetary systems." 

Biron nodded. It was a wellworn statistic. Every child was 
taught that in elementary Galactography. 

Gillbret went on, "That means 
that the chances of finding three 
stars at random without a single 
planet — without one single planet 
— is two-thirds cubed, which is 
eight twenty-sevenths, or less than 
one in three." 

"So?" 

"And we haven't found any. 
There must be a mistake." 

"You saw the plates yourself. 
And besides, what price statistics? 
For all we know, conditions are 
different inside a Nebula. Maybe 
the particle-fog prevents planets 
from forming, or maybe the fog is 
the result of planets that didn't 
coalesce." 

"You mean that?" said Gillbret, 
stricken. 



"You're right. I'm just talking 
to hear myself. I don't know anything about cosmogony. Why the 
hell are planets formed anyway? 
Never heard of one that wasn't 
filled with trouble." Biron looked 
haggard himself. He w r as still printing and pasting up little stickers on 
the control panels. 

He said, "Anyway, we've got the 
blasters all worked out; range-finders, power-control, all that." 

It was very difficult not to look 
at the visiplate. They'd be Jumping 
again soon, through that ink. 

Biron said, absently, "You know 
why they call it the Horsehead Nebula, Gil?" 

"The first man to enter it was 
Horace Hedd. Are you going to 
tell me that's wrong?" 

"It may be. They have a different explanation on Earth." 

"Oh?" 

"They claim it's called that because it looks like a horse's head." 

"What's a horse?" 

"It's an extinct animal on 
Earth." 

"It's an amusing thought, but 
the Nebula doesn't look like any 
animal to me, Biron." 

"It depends on the angle you 
look at it. Now from Nephelos, it 
looks like a man's arm with three 
fingers, but I looked at it once from 
the observatory at the University 
of Earth. It does look a little like 
some creature's head. Maybe that is 
how the name started. Maybe there 
never was any Horace Hedd. Who 



TYRANN 



115 



knows?*" Biron felt bored with the 
matter, already. He was still talking simply to hear himself talk. 

THERE was a pause; that lasted 
too long, because it gave Gillbret a chance to bring up a subject 
which Biron did not wish to discuss and could not force himself 
to stop thinking about. 

Gillbret said f "Where's Arta?" 
Biron looked at him quickly, and 
said, "Somewhere in the trailer. I 
don't follow her about." 

"The Autarch does. He might as 
well be living here." 
"Lucky for her." 
Gillbret's wrinkles became more 
pronounced and his small features 
seemed to screw together. "Oh, 
don't be a fool, Biron. Arfemisia 
is a Hinriad. She can't take what 
you've been giving her." 
Biron said, "Drop it." 
"I won't. I've been spoiling to 
say this. Why are you doing this 
to her? Because Hinrik might have 
been responsible for your father's 
death ? Hinrik is my cousin ! You 
haven't changed toward me." 

"All right," Biron said, "I 
haven't changed toward you. I speak 
to you as I always have. I speak to 
Artemisia as well." 
"As you always have?" 
Biron was silent. 
Gillbret said, "You're throwing 
her at the Autarch." 
"It's her choice." 
"It isn't. It's your choice. Listen, 
Biron." Gillbret put a hand on 



Biron's knee. "This isn't a thing I 
like to interfere with, you understand. It's just that she's the only 
good thing in the Hinriad family 
just now. Would you be amused if 
I said I loved her? I have no children of my own." 

"I don't question your love." 

"Then I advise you for her good. 
Stop the Autarch, Biron." 

"I thought you trusted him." 

"As the Autarch, yes. As an antiTyranni leader, yes. But as a man 
for a woman, as a man for Artemisia, no." 

"Tell her that." 

"She wouldn't listen." 

"Do you think she would if I 
told her?" 

"If you told her properly," 

For a moment, Biron seemed to 
hesitate, his tongue dabbing slightly at dry lips. Then he turned 
away, saying harshly, "I don't want 
to talk about it." 

Gillbret said, sadly, "You'll regret this." 

Biron said nothing. Why didn't 
Gillbret leave him alone? It had 
occurred to him many times that 
he might regret all this. But what 
could he do? There was no easy 
way of backing out. 

BIRON had set the controls in 
accordance with the instructions from the Autarch's pilot, and 
left the manuals to Gillbret. He 
was going to sleep through this 
Jump. And then Gillbret was shaking his shoulder. 




 



"Biron! Biron!" 

Biron rolled over in his bunk, 
and out, landing in a crouch, fists 
balled. "What is it?" 

Gillbret stepped back hastily. 
"Now, take it easy. We've got an 
F-2 this time." 

It sank in. Biron drew a deep 
breath, and relaxed. "Don't ever 
wake me that way, Gillbret. An 
F-2, you say? I suppose you're referring to the new star." 

"I surely am. It looks most 
amusing, I think." 

In a way, it did. Approximately 
95% of habitable planets in the 
Galaxy circled stars of spectral 
types F or G; diameter from 750 to 
1500 thousand miles, surface temperature from rive to ten thousand 
centigrade. Earth's sun was G-0, 
Rhodia's F-8, Lingane's G-2, as was 
that of Nephelos. F-2 was a little 
warm, but not too warm. 

The first three stars they had 
stopped at were of spectral type K, 
rather small and ruddy. Planets 
would probably not have been noteworthy even if they had had any. 

A good star is a good star ! In 
the first day of photography, five 
planets were located, the nearest 
being one hundred fifty millions 
of miles from the primary. 

Tedor Rizzett brought the news 
personally. He visited the Remorseless as frequently as the Autarch, 
lighting the ship with his heartiness. He was whoofing and panting 
this time from the hand-over-hand 
exercise along the metal line. 



He said, "I don't know how the 
Autarch does it. He never seems 
to mind. Comes from being younger, I guess." He added, abruptly, 
"Five planets!" 

Gillbret said, "For this star ? 
You're sure?" 

"It's definite. Four of them are 
J-type, though." 

"And the fifth?"' 

"The fifth may be all right. Oxygen in the atmosphere, anyway." 

GILLBRET set up a thin yell of 
triumph, but Biron said, "Four 
are J-type. Oh, well, we only need 
one." 

He realized it was a reasonable 
distribution. The large majority of 
sizable planets in the Galaxy possessed hydrogenated atmospheres. 
After all, stars are mostly hydrogen and they are the source material of planetary building blocks. 
J-type planets had atmospheres of 
methane or ammonia with molecular hydrogen in addition sometimes, 
also considerable helium. Such atmospheres were usually deep and 
extremely dense. The planets themselves were almost invariably thirty 
thousand miles in diameter and up, 
with a mean temperature of rarely 
more than fifty below zero, centigrade. They were cjuite uninhabitable. 

Back on Earth, they used to tell 
him that these planets were called 
J-type because the J stood for Jupiter, the planet in Earth's solar system which was the best example of 



TYRANN 



117 



the type. Maybe they were right. 
Certainly, the other planet-classification was the E-type, and E did 
stand for Earth. E- types were usually small, comparatively, and their 
weaker gravity could not retain 
hydrogen or the hydrogen-containing gases, particularly since they 
were usually closer to the sun and 
warmer. Their atmospheres were 
thin and contained oxygen and 
nitrogen usually, with, occasionally, 
an admixture of chlorine. 

"How well have they gone over 
the atmosphere?" asked Biron. 

Rizzett shrugged, "We can only 
judge the upper reaches from out 
in space. If there were any chlorine, it would concentrate toward 
ground-level. We'll see." 

He clapped a hand on Biron's 
large shoulder. "How about inviting me to a small drink in your 
room, boy?" 

Gillbret looked after them uneasily. With the Autarch courting 
Artemisia, and his right-hand man 
becoming a drinking companion of 
Biron's, the Remorseless was becoming more Linganian than not. He 
wondered if Biron knew what he 
was doing, then thought of the 
new planet and let the rest go. 

ARTEMISIA was in the pilot 
room when they penetrated 
the atmosphere. There was a little 
smile on her face and she seemed 
quite contented. Biron looked in 
her direction occasionally. He had 
said, "Good day, Artemisia," when 



she came in — she hardly ever did 
come in; he had been caught by 
surprise — but she hadn't answered. 

She had merely said, "Uncle 
Gil," very brightly; then, "Is it 
true we're landing?" 

Gil had rubbed his hands. "It 
seems so, my dear. We may be getting out of the ship in a few hours, 
walking on solid surface. How's 
that for an amusing thought?" 

"I hope it's the right planet. If 
it isn't, it won't be so amusing." 

"There's still another star," said 
Gil, but his brow furrowed. 

And then Artemisia turned to 
Biron and said, frigidly, "Did you 
speak, Mr. Farrill?" 

Biron, caught by surprise again, 
started and said, "No, not really." 

"I beg your pardon, then. I 
thought you had." 

She passed by him so closely that 
the plastic flair of her dress brushed 
his knee and her perfume, momentarily, surrounded him. 

Rizzett was still with them; one 
of the advantages of the trailer was 
that they could put a guest up overnight. He said, "They're getting 
details on the atmosphere now. 
Lots of oxygen, almost 30^, and 
nitrogen and inert gases. It's quite 
normal. No chlorine." Then he 
stopped and went "Hmm." 

Gillbret said, "What's the matter?" 

"No carbon dioxide. That's not 
so good." 

"Why not?" demanded Artemisia from her vantage-point near 




 



the visiplate, where she watched 
the distant surface of the planet 
blur past at two thousand miles an 
hour. 

Biron said, curtly, "No carbon 
dioxide, no plant life." 

"Oh?" She looked at him, and 
smiled warmly. 

Biron, against his will, smiled 
back, and somehow, with scarcely 
a visible change in her countenance, 
she was smiling through him, past 
him, obviously unaware of his existence; and he was left there, 
caught in a foolish smile. He let it 
fade. 

It was just as well he avoided 
her. Certainly, when he was with 
her, he couldn't keep it up. When 
he could actually see her, the anesthetic of his will didn't work. It 
began hurting. 

GILLBRET was doleful. They 
were coasting now. In the 
thick lower reaches of the atmosphere, the Remorseless with its 
aerodynamically undesirable addition of a trailer was difficult to 
handle. 

Biron fought the bucking controls stubbornly. 

He said, "Cheer up, Gil!" 

He felt not exactly jubilant himself. Radio signals had brought no 
response as yet, and if this were not 
the "rebellion world," there would 
be no point in waiting longer. His 
line of action was set. 

Gillbret said, "It's rocky and 
dead, and not much water, either."' 



He turned. "Did they try for carbon dioxide again, Rizzett?" 

Rizzett's ruddy face was long. 
"Yes. Just a trace. About a thousandth of a per cent or so." 

Biron said, "You can't tell. They 
might pick a world like this, just 
because it would look so hopeless." 

"But I saw farms," said Gillbret. 

"How much do you suppose we 
can see of a planet this size by 
circling it a few times? You know 
damn well, Gil, that whoever they 
are, they can't have enough people 
to fill a whole planet. They may 
have picked themselves a valley 
somewhere where the carbon dioxide of the air has been built up, 
say, by volcanic action and where 
there's plenty of nearby water. We 
could whizz within twenty miles of 
them, and never know it. Naturally, they wouldn't be ready to 
answer radio calls without considerable investigation." 

"You can't build up a concentration of carbon dioxide that easily," 
muttered Gillbret. But he watched 
the visiplate intently. 

Biron suddenly hoped that it 
was the wrong world. He decided 
that he could wait no longer. It 
would have to be settled, now! 

IT WAS a queer feeling. 
The artificial lights had been 
turned off and sunlight was coming 
in unhindered at the ports. Actually, it was the less efficient method 
of lighting the ship, but there was 
a sudden desirable novelty to it. 



TYRANN 



119 



The ports were open, in fact, and 
the native atmosphere could be 
breathed. 

Rizzett advised against it on the 
grounds that lack of carbon dioxide would upset the respiratory 
regulation of the body, but Biron 
thought it might be bearable for a 
short time. 

GiUbret had come upon them, 
heads together. They looked up, 
and leaned away from one another. 

Gillbret laughed. Then he looked 
out of the open port, sighed, and 
said, "Rocks!" 

Biron said, mildly, "We're going to set up a radio transmitter at 
the top of the high ground. We'll 
get more range that way. We ought 
to be able to contact all of this 
hemisphere at any rate. And if it's 
negative, we can try the other side 
of the planet." 

"Is that what you and Rizzett 
were discussing?" 

"Exactly. The Autarch and I 
will do the job. It's his suggestion, 
which is fortunate, since otherwise 
I would have had to make the same 
suggestion myself." He looked 
fleetingly at Rizzett as he spoke. 
Rizzett was expressionless. 

Biron stood up. "J think it would 
be best if I unzipped my spacesuit lining and wore that." 

Rizzett was in agreement. It was 
sunny on this planet; little water vapor in the air, no clouds; but it 
was briskly cold. 

The Autarch was at the main 
lock of the Remorseless,. His over


coat was of thin foamite that 
weighed a fraction of an ounce, yet 
did a near-perfect job of insulation. 
A small carbon dioxide cylinder 
was strapped to his chest, adjusted 
to a slow leak that would maintain 
a perceptible. C0 2 vapor tension in 
his immediate vicinity. 

He said, "Would you care to 
search me, Farrill?" He raised his 
hands and waited, his lean face 
quietly amused. 

"No," said Biron. "Do you want 
to check me for weapons?" 

"I wouldn't think of it." 

The courtesies were as frigid as 
the weather. 

BIRON stepped out into the sunlight and tugged at his handle 
of the two-handled suitcase in 
which the radio equipment was 
stowed. The Autarch caught the 
other. 

"Not too heavy," said Biron. He 
turned, and Artemisia was standing 
just within the ship, silent. 

Her dress was a smooth, unfigured white which folded in a 
smooth drape that fled before the 
wind. The semi-transparent sleeves 
whipped back against her arms, 
turning them to silver. 

For a moment, Biron melted dangerously. He wanted to return 
quickly; to run, leap into the ship, 
grasp her so that his fingers would 
leave bruises on her shoulders; feel 
his lips meet hers — 

But he n od d ed bri efly i n s tea d ; 
her returning smile and the light 



120 




 



flutter of her fingers were for the 
Autarch. 

Five minutes later he turned and 
there was still that glimmer of 
white at the open door, and then 
the rise in the ground cut off the 
view of the ship. The horizon was 
free of anything but broken and 
bare rock now. 

Biron thought of what lay ahead, 
and wondered if he would ever see 
Artemisia again — and if she would 
care if he never returned. 

CHAPTER XVIII 

Out of the Jaws 

ARTEMISIA watched them as 
they became tiny figures trudging up the bare granite, then dipping below and out of sight. For 
8 moment, just before they disappeared, one of them had turned. 
She couldn't be sure which one, and, 
for a moment, her heart hardened. 

She said, peevishly, "Uncle Gil, 
why don't you close the ports? It's 
enough to freeze a person to death," 
The thermometer dial read plus 
seven Centigrade with the ship's 
heaters on high. 

"My dear Arta," said Gillbret, 
mildly, "if you will persist in your 
ridiculous habit of wearing nothing 
but a little fog here and there, you 
must expect to be cold." But he 
closed contacts, and, with little 
clicks, the airlock slid shut, the 
ports swung inward and molded 
themselves into the smooth, gleam


ing hull. As they did so, the thick 
glass polarized and became nontransparent. The lights of the ship 
went on and the shadows disappeared. 

Artemisia sat down in the heavily 
padded pilot's seat and fingered the 
arms aimlessly. His hands had often 
rested there and the slight warmth 
that flooded her as she thought that 
— she told herself — was only the 
result of the heaters making themselves felt decently, now that the 
outer winds were excluded. 

The long minutes passed, and it 
became impossible to sit quietly. 
She might have gone with him! She 
corrected the rebellious thought instantly to the plural "them." 

She said, "Why do they have to 
set up a radio transmitter anyway, 
Uncle Gil?" 

He looked up from the visiplate, 
the controls of which he was fingering delicately, and said, "Eh?" 

"We've been trying to contact 
them from out in space," she said, 
"and we haven't reached anyone. 
What special good would a transmitter on the planet's surface do?" 

Gillbret was troubled. "Why, we 
must keep trying, my dear. We 
must find the 'rebellion world'." 
And, between his teeth, he added to 
himself, "We must!" -A moment 
passed, and he said, "I can't find 
them." 

"Find whom?" 

"Biron and the Autarch. The 
ridge cuts me off no matter how I 
arrange the external mirrors. See?" 



TYRANN 



121 



She saw nothing but the sunny 
rock flashing past. 

Then Gillbret brought the little 
gears to rest and said, "Anyway, 
that's the Autarch's ship." 

Artemisia accorded it the briefest 
of glances. It lay deeper in the valley, perhaps a mile away. It glistened unbearably in the sun. It 
seemed to her, at the moment, to 
be the real enemy. // was, not the 
Tyranni. She wished suddenly, 
sharply, and very strongly that they 
had never gone to Lingane; that 
they had remained in space, the 
three of them only. Those had been 
funny days; so uncomfortable and 
yet so warm, somehow. And now 
she could only try to hurt him. 
Something made her hurt him, 
though she would have liked — 

Gillbret said, "Now what does he 
want?" 

ARTEMISIA looked up at him, 
seeing him through a watery 
mist, so that she had to blink rapidly to put him into normal focus. 
"Who?" 

"Rizzett. I think that's Rizzett. 
But he's certainly not coming this 
way." 

Artemisia was at the visiplate. 
"Make it larger," she ordered. 

"At this, short distance?" objected Gillbret. "You won't see anything. It will be impossible to keep 
it centered." 

"Larger, Uncle Gil." 

Muttering, he threw in the telescopic attachment and searched the 



bloated nubbles of rock that resulted. They jumped faster than the 
eye could follow at the lightest 
touch on the controls. For one moment Rizzett, a large, hazy figure, 
flashed past, and in that moment 
his identity was unmistakable. Gillbret backtracked wildly, caught him 
again, hung on for a moment, and 
Artemisia said, "He's armed. Did 
you see that?" 
"No." 

"He's got a long-range blasting 
rifle." 

She was up, tearing at the locker. 

"Arta! What are you doing?" 

She was unzipping the lining 
from another spacesuit. "I'm going 
out there. Rizzett's following them. 
Don't you understand ? The Autarch hasn't gone out to set up a 
radio. It's a trap for Biron." She 
was gasping as she forced herself 
into the thick, coarse lining. 

"Stop it ! You' re imagining 
things." 

But she was staring at Gillbret 
without seeing him, her face 
pinched and white. She should have 
realized it before; the way Rizzett 
had been coddling that fool. That 
emotional fool ! Rizzett had praised 
his father; told him what a great 
man the Rancher of Widemos had 
been and Biron had melted immediately. His every action was dictated by the thought of his father. 
How could a man let himself be 
rided by a monomania? 

She said, "I don't know what 
controls the airlock. Open it." 




 



"Arta, you're not leaving the 
ship. You don't know where they 
are." 

"I'll find them. Open the airlock." Gillbret shook his head. But 
the spacesuit she had stripped had 
borne a holster. She said, "Uncle 
Gil, I'll use this. I swear I will." 

Gillbret found himself staring at 
the wicked muzzle of a neuronic 
whip. He forced a smile. "Don"t 
now!" 

"Open the lock!" 

He did and she was out, running 
into the wind, slipping across the 
rocks and up the ridge. The blood 
pounded in her ears. She had been 
as bad as Biron, dangling the Autarch before him for no other purpose than her silly pride. The Autarch's personality sharpened in her 
mind; a man so studiedly cold as to 
be bloodless and tasteless. She 
quivered with repulsion. 

She had topped the ridge, and 
there was nothing ahead of her. 
Stolidly, she walked onward, holding the neuronic whip before her. 

BIRON and Autarch had not exchanged a word during their 
walk, and now they came to a halt 
where the ground leveled off. The 
rock was fissured by the action of 
sun and wind through the millenia. 
Ahead of them, there was an ancient fault, the farther lip of which 
had crurnbled downward, leaving a 
sheer precipice of a hundred feet. 

Biron approached cautiously and 
looked over it. It slanted outward 



past the drop, the ground riddled 
with craggy boulders which, with 
time and infrequent rains, had scattered out as far as he could see. 

"It looks," he said, "like a hopeless world, Jonti." 

The Autarch displayed none of 
Biron's curiosity in his surroundings. He did not approach the drop. 
He said, "This is the place we 
found before landing. It's ideal for 
our purposes." 

"It's ideal for your purposes, at 
least," thought Biron. He stepped 
away from the edge and sat down. 
He listened to the tiny hiss from 
his carbon dioxide cylinder, and 
waited a moment. Then he said, 
very quietly, "What will you tell 
them when you get back to your 
ship, Jonti? Or shall I guess?" 

The Autarch paused in the act 
of opening the two-handled suitcase they had carried. He straightened and said, "What are you talking about?" 

Biron felt the wind numb his 
face and rubbed his nose with his 
gloved hand. Yet he unbuttoned the 
foamile lining that wrapped him, 
so that it flapped wide as the gusts 
hit it. He said, "I'm talking about 
your purpose in coming here." 

"I would like to set up the radio 
rather than waste my time discussing the matter, Farrill." 

"You won't set up a radio. Why 
should you ? We tried reaching * 
them from space, without a response. There's no reason to expect 
more of a transmitter on the sur


TYRANN 



123 



face. It's not a question of ionized 
radio-opaque layers in the upper 
atmosphere, either, because we tried 
the sub-ether as well and drew a 
blank. Nor are we particularly the 
radio experts in our party. So why 
did you really come up here, 
Jonti?" 

The Autarch sat down opposite 
Biron. His hand patted the suitcase idly. "If you are troubled by 
these doubts, why did you come?" 

"To find out. Your man, Rizzett, 
told me you were planning this trip, 
and advised me to join you. I believe that your instructions to him 
were to tell me that, by joining you, 
I might make certain you received 
no messages that I remained unaware of. It was a reasonable point, 
except that I don't think you will 
receive any messages. But I allowed it to persuade me, and I've 
come with you." 

"To find my motive?" said Jonti, 
mockingly. 

"Exactly. 1 can guess already." 

"Tell me then. Let me learn my 
motive, too." 

"You came to kill me. I am here 
alone with you, and there is a cliff 
before us over which it would be 
certain death to fall. There would 
be no signs of deliberate violence. 
There would be no blasted limbs 
or any thought of weapon-play. It 
would make a nice, sad story to take 
back to your ship. I had slipped 
and fallen. You might even bring 
back a party to gather me up and 
give me a decent burial. It would 



all be very touching and I would 
be out of your way." 

"You believe this and yet you 
came." 

"1 expect it, so you won't catch 
me by surprise. We are unarmed 
and I doubt that you could force 
me over by muscle power alone." 

JONTI laughed. "Shall we concern ourselves with our radio 
transmitter then, since vour death is 
now impossible?" 

"Not yet. I want your admission 
that you were going to try to kill 
me." 

"Oh? Do you intend to beat a 
confession out of me? Now understand, Farrill, you are a young man 
and I am disposed to make allowances because of that and because 
of the convenience of your name 
and rank. However, I must admit 
you have until now been more 
trouble than help to me." 

"By keeping alive, despite you?" 

"If you refer to the risks you 
ran on Rhodia, I have explained 
it. I will not explain it again." 

Biron rose. "Your explanation 
was not accurate. It has a flaw in it 
which was obvious from the beginning." 

"Really?" 

"Really! Stand up and listen to 
me, or I'll drag you to your feet." 

The Autarch's eyes narrowed to 
slits as he rose. "I would not advise you to attempt violence, youngster." 

"Listen." Biron's voice was loud 



124 




 



and his cloak still bellied open in 
the breeze, disregarded. "You said 
that you sent me to a possible death 
on Rhodia only to implicate the Director in an anti-Tyranni plot." 

"That remains true." 

"That remains a lie. Your prime 
object was to have me killed. You 
informed the captain of the Rhodian ship of my identity at the very 
beginning. You had no real reason 
for believing that I would ever be 
allowed to reach Hinrik." 

"If I had wanted to kill you, Farrill, I might have planted a real 
radiation bomb in your room on 
Earth." 

"It would have been obviously 
more convenient to have the Tyranni maneuvered into doing the killing for you." 

"I might have killed you in space 
when I first boarded the Remorseless." 

"So you might. You came equipped with a blaster and you had it 
leveled at me at one point. You 
had expected me on board, but 
you hadn't told your crew that. 
When Rizzett called and saw me, 
it was no longer possible to blast 
me. You made a mistake then. You 
told me you had told your men I 
was probably on board, and a while 
later Rizzett told me you had not. 
Don't you brief your men concerning your exact lies as you tell them, 
Jonti?" 

Jonti's face had been white in 
the cold, but it seemed to whiten 
further. "I should kill you now for 



that, certainly. But what held back 
my trigger finger before Rizzett got 
on the visiplate and saw you?" 

"Politics, Jonti. Artemisia oth 
Hinriad was aboard, and for the 
moment she was a more important 
object than myself. I'll give you 
credit for a quick change of plans. 
To have killed me in her presence 
would have ruined a bigger game.'' 

<<T HAD fallen in love so rapid1 ly,then?"" 

"When the girl concerned is a 
Hinriad, why not? You lost no 
time. You tried first to have her 
transferred to your ship and when 
that failed, you told me that Hinrik had betrayed my father. So I 
lost her and left you the field undisputed. Now, I presume, she is 
no longer a factor. She is firmly on 
your side and you may proceed 
with your plan to kill me without 
losing the Hinriad succession." 

Jonti sighed and said, "Farrill, 
it is cold and getting colder. I believe the sun is heading downward. 
You are unutterably foolish and you 
weary me. Before we end this nonsense, will you tell me why I should 
be in the least interested in killing 
you? That is, if your obvious paranoia needs any reason." 

"There is the same reason that 
caused you to kill my father." 

"What?" 

"Did you think I believed you 
for an instant when you said Hinrik had been the traitor? He might 
have been, were it not for the fact 



TYRANN 



125 



that his reputation as a wretched 
weakling is so well established. Do 
you suppose that my father was a 
complete fool? Could he possibly 
have mistaken Hinrik for anything 
but what he was? If he had not 
known his reputation, would not 
live minutes in Hinrik's presence 
have revealed him as a hopeless 
puppet ? Would my father have 
babbled foolishly to Hinrik anything that might have been used to 
support a charge of treason against 
him? No, Jonti. The man who betrayed my father must have been 
one who was trusted by him." 

Jonti took a step backward and 
kicked the suitcase aside. He poised 
himself to withstand a charge and 
said, "I see your vile implication. 
My only explanation for it is that 
you are psychotic." 

Biron was trembling, and not 
with cold. "My father was popular 
with your men, Jonti. Too popular. 
An Autarch cannot allow a competitor in the business of ruling. 
You saw to it that he did not remain a competitor. And it was your 
next job to see to it that I did not 
remain alive either to replace or to 
avenge him." His voice raised to a 
shout, which whipped away on the 
cold air. "Isn't this true?" 

"No!" Jonti bent to the suitcase. 
"I can prove you are wrong!" He 
flung it open. "Radio equipment. 
Inspect it carefully. Take a good 
look at it." 

He tossed the items to the 
ground at Biron 's feet. Birbn stared 



at them. "How does that prove anything?" 

"It doesn't. But now take a good 
look at this." He had a blaster in 
his hand, and the coolness had left 
his voice. He said, "I am tired of 
you. But I won't have to be tired 
much longer." 

BIRON said, tonelessly, "You 
hid a blaster in the suitcase 
with (he equipment?" 

"You honestly came here expecting to be thrown off a cliff and you 
thought I would try to do it with 
my hands as though I were a stevedore or a coal-miner. I am Autarch 
of Lingane." 

His face worked and his left 
hand made a flat, cutting gesture 
before him. "I am tired of the fatuous idealism of the Ranchers of 
Widemos." He whispered, "Move 
on. Toward the cliff." He stepped 
forward. 

Biron", hands raised, eyes on the 
blaster, stepped back. "You killed 
my father, then." 

"I killed your father!" said the 
Autarch. "The same man who saw 
to it that your father was blasted 
to bits in a disintegration chamber 
will see to it that you follow him — 
and keep the Hinriad girl for himself thereafter, along with all that 
goes with her. I will give you an 
extra minute to think of that ! But 
keep your hands steady, or I will 
blast you and risk any questions my 
men may care to ask." It was as 
though his cold veneer, having 



125 




 



cracked, left nothing but a burning passion exposed. 

"You tried to kill me before 
this," Biron said stubbornly. 

"I did. Your guesses were in 
every way correct. Does that help 
you now? Back." 

"No," said Biron. He brought 
his- hands down. "If you're going 
to shoot, do so." 

The Autarch said, "You think I 
will not dare? You're calling my 
bluff?" 

"I've asked you to shoot." 

"And I will." The Autarch aimed 
deliberately at Biron's head at a 
distance of four feet. 

CHAPTER XIX 

Defeat! 

TEDOR RIZZETT circled the little piece of tableland warily. 
He was not yet ready to be seen, 
but to remain hidden was difficult 
in this world of bare rock. In the 
patch of tumbled boulders he felt 
safer. He threaded his way through 
them. Occasionally, he paused to 
pass the soft back of the spongy 
gloves he wore over his face. The 
dry cold was deceptive. 

He saw them now from between 
two granite monoliths that met in 
a V and rested his blaster in the 
crotch. The sun was on his back. 
He felt its feeble warmth soak 
through, and he was satisfied. If 
they happened to look in his direction, the sun would be in their eyes 



and he himself would be that much 
less visible. 

Their voices were sharp in his 
ear. Radio communication was in 
operation and he smiled at that. So 
far, according to plan. His own 
presence, of course, was not according to plan, but it would be better 
so. The plan was a rather overconfident one and the victim was not a 
complete fool, after all. Rizzett's 
own blaster might yet be needed lo 
decide the issue. 

He waited. Stolidly, he watched 
the Autarch lift his blaster as Biron 
stood there, unflinching. 

ARTEMISIA did not see the 
blaster lift. She did not see 
the two figures on the flat rock surface. Five minutes earlier, she had 
seen Rizzett silhouetted for a moment against the sky and since then 
she had followed him. 

He was moving too fast for her 
somehow. Things dimmed and wavered before her and twice she found 
herself stretched on the ground. 
She did not recall falling. The second time, she staggered to her feet 
with one wrist oozing blood where 
a sharp edge had scraped her. 

Rizzett had gained again and she 
had to reel after him. When he 
vanished in the glistening boulderforest, she sobbed in despair. She 
leaned against one of them, completely wear)-. Its beautiful fleshpink tint, the glassy smoothness of 
its surface, the fact that it stood as 
an ancient reminder of a primeval 



TYRANN 



127 



volcanic age were all lost upon her. 

She could only try to tight the 
sensation of choking that pervaded 
her. 

And then she saw him, dwarfed 
at the forked rock formation, his 
back to her. She held the neuronic 
whip before her as she ran unevenly 
over the hard ground. He was sighting along the barrel of his rifle, intent upon the process; taking aim; 
getting ready. 

She wouldn't make it in time. 

She would have to distract his 
attention. She called, "Rizzctt!" 
And again, "Rizzctt, don't shoot!" 
• She stumbled again. The sun was 



blotting out, but consciousness lingered. It lingered long enough for 
her to feel the ground jar thuddingly against her; long enough to 
press her finger upon the whip's 
contact; and long enough for her 
to know that she was well out of 
range, even if her aim w r as accurate. 

She felt arms about her, lifting. 
She tried to see, but her eyelids 
would not open. 

"Biron?" It was a weak whisper. 

The answer was a rough blur of 
words, but it was Rizzett's voice. 
She tried to speak further, then abruptly gave up. She had failed! 

Everything was blotted out. 



128 




 



THE AUTARCH remained motionless for the space it would 
take a man to count to ten slowly. 
Biron faced him as motionlessly, 
watching the barrel of the blaster 
that had just been fired point-blank 
at him. The barrel sank slowly as 
he watched. 

Biron said, "Your blaster seems 
not to be in firing order. Examine 
it." 

The Autarch's bloodless face 
turned alternately to Biron and to 
his weapon. He had fired at a distance of four feet. It should have 
been all over. The congealed astonishment that held him broke suddenly and he disjointed the blaster 
in a quick movement. 

The energy capsule was missing; 
where it should have been, there 
was a useless cavity. The Autarch 
with rage hurled the lump of dead 
metal aside. It turned over and 
over, a black blot against the sun, 
smashing into the rock with a ringing sound. 

Biron took a slow step forward. 
"There are many ways I could kill 
you, but most of them are too 
quick. I think the most satisfying 
would be to let you fight for your 
life — knowing you can't win. Being 
a stevedore would be more helpful 
right now than being Autarch of 
Lingane." 

His thigh muscles tensed, but the 
lunge they prepared was never completed. 

The cry that interrupted was thin 
and high, packed with panic. 

TYRANN 



"Rizzett !" it came. "Rizzett, 
don't shoot !" 

Biron whirled in time to see the 
motion behind the rocks a hundred 
yards away and the glint of sun 
off metal. And then the hurled 
weight of a human body was upon 
his back. He bent under it, dropping to his knees. 

The Autarch had landed fairly, 
his knees clasped hard about Biron 's 
waist, his fist thudding at the nape 
of the neck. Biron's breath 
whooshed out. He fought off the 
gathering blackness long enough to 
throw himself to one side. The Autarch jumped free, gaining clear 
footing while Biron sprawled on his 
back. 

He had just time to double his 
legs up against himself as the Autarch lunged down upon him again. 
The Autarch bounced off. They 
were up together this time, perspiration turning icy upon their 
cheeks. 

Slowly, they circled. Biron tossed 
his carbon dioxide cylinder to one 
side. The Autarch unstrapped his 
likewise, held it suspended a moment by its mesh-metal hose, then 
stepped in rapidly and swung it. 
Biron dropped, heard and felt it 
whistle above his head. 

He was up again, leaping before 
the Autarch could regain his balance. One large fist clamped down 
on a wrist, while the other exploded 
in the Autarch's face. He let the 
Autarch drop and stepped back. 

Biron said, "Stand up. I'll wait 

129 



for you with more of the same. 
There's no hurry." 

The Autarch touched his gloved 
hand to his face, then stared sickly 
at the blood that smeared off upon 
it. His mouth twisted and his hand 
snaked out for the metal cylinder 
he had dropped. Biron's foot came 
heavily down upon it, and the Autarch yelled in agony. 

Biron said, "You're too close to 
the edge of the cliff, Jonti. I'll 
throw you the other way now." 

But Rizzett's voice rang out, 
"Wait!" 

The Autarch screamed, "Shoot 
this man, Rizzett! His arms first, 
then his legs, and we'll leave him." 

Rizzett brought his weapon up 
slowly against his shoulder. 

Biron said, "Who saw lo it that 
your own blaster was unloaded, 
Jonti?" 

"What?" The Autarch stared 
blankly. 

"It was not I who had access to 
your blaster, Jonti. Who did have? 
Who is pointing a blaster at you 
right now? Not at me, Jonti, but 
at yon!" 

The Autarch turned to Rizzett 
and screamed, "Traitor!" 

Rizzett said, in a low voice, "Not 
I, sir. That man is the traitor who 
betrayed the loyal Rancher of Widemos to his death." 

"That is not I," cried the Autarch. "If he has told you I have, 
he lies." 

"It is you yourself who have told 
us. I not only emptied your wea


pon; I also shorted your communicator switch so that every word you 
said today was received by myself 
and by every member of the crew. 
We all know what you are." 

"I am your Autarch." 

"And also the foulest traitor 
alive." 

FDR a moment, the Autarch said 
nothing but looked from one 
to the other as they watched him 
with somber, angry faces. Then he 
wrenched to his feet, pulled together the parted seams of his selfcontrol and held them tightly by 
sheer nervous force. 

His voice was almost cool as he 
said, "And if it were all true, what 
would it matter? You have no 
choice but to let matters stand as 
they are. One last intra-nebular 
planet remains to be visited. It 
must be the 'Rebellion World' and 
only I know the co-ordinates." 

He retained dignity somehow. 
One hand hung uselessly from a 
broken wrist; his upper lip had 
swollen ludicrously and blood was 
caking his cheek, but he radiated 
the hauteur of one born to rule. 
"You'll tell us," said Biron. 
"Don't delude yourself that I 
will under any circumstances. And 
I have warned you already that 
there is an average of seventy cubic 
light years per star. If you work 
by trial and error, without me, the 
odds are 250 quadrillion to one 
against your coming within a billion 
miles of any star. Any star!" 



130 




 



Something went click in Biron's 
mind. He said, "Take him back to 
the Remorseless!'* 

Rizzett said in a low voice, "The 
Lady Artemisia — " 

And Biron interrupted. "Then 
it was she. Where is she?" 

"She's safe. She came out without a carbon dioxide cylinder. Naturally as the C0 2 washed out of her 
blood stream, the automatic breathing mechanism of the body slowed. 
She was trying to run, didn't realize 
she had to breath voluntarily, and 
fainted." 

Biron frowned. "Why was she 
trying to interfere with you, anyway? Making sure her boy-friend 
didn't get hurt?" 

Rizzett said, "She thought I was 
the Autarch's man and was going 
to shoot you. I'll take back this rat 
now, and, Biron — " 

"Yes?" 

"Get back as soon as you can. 
He's still the Autarch, and the crew 
may need talking to. It's hard to 
break a lifetime habit of obedience. 
She's behind that rock. Get to her 
before she freezes to death, will 
you? She won't leave." 

HER face was almost buried in 
the hood that covered her 
head, and her body was formless 
in the thick, enveloping folds of 
the spacesuit lining, but his steps 
quickened as he approached her. 
He said, "How are you?" 
She said, "Better, thank you. I 
am sorry if I caused any trouble." 



They stood looking at each other, 
and the conversation seemed to have 
burned itself out in two lines. 

Then Biron said, "I know we 
can't turn time backward, undo 
things that have been done, unsay 
things that have been said. But I 
do want you to understand." 

"Why this stress on understanding?" Her eyes flashed. "I have 
done nothing but understand for 
weeks now. Will you tell me again 
about my father?" 

"No. I knew your father was innocent. I suspected the Autarch almost from the start, but I had to 
find out definitely. I could only 
prove it, Arta, by forcing him to 
confess. I thought I could get him 
to confess by trapping him into attempting to kill me and there was 
only one way of doing that." 

He felt w-retched. He went on. 
"It was a rotten thing to do. As 
rotten, almost, as what he did to 
my father. I don't expect you to 
forgive me." 

She said, "I don't understand a 
word you're saying." 

"I knew he wanted you, Arta. 
Politically, you would be a perfect 
matrimonial object. The name of 
Hinriad would be more useful for 
his purposes than that of Widcmos. 
So once he had you, he would need 
me no longer. I deliberately forced 
you on him, Arta. I acted as I did. 
hoping you would turn to him. 
When you did, he thought he was 
ready to rid himself of me, and 
Rizzett and I laid our trap." 



TYRANN 



131 



"And you loved me all the 
time?" 

Biron said, "Can't you bring 
yourself to believe that, Arta?" 

"And, of course, you were ready 
to sacrifice your love to the memory 
of your father and the fconor of 
your family. How does the old doggerel go? You could not love me 
half so much, loved you not honor 
more!" 

Biron said, miserably, ' 'Please, 
Arta ! 1 am not proud of myself but 
I could think of no other way," 

"You might have told me your 
plan, made me your confederate 
rather than your tool." 

"It was not your fight. If I had 
failed — and I might have — you 
would have remained out of it. If 
the Autarch had killed me, and you 
were no longer on my side, you 
would be less hurt. You might have 
married him; even been happy." 

"Since you' have won, it might 
be that I would be hurt at bis loss." 

"But yoq aren't." 

"How do you know?" 

Biron said, desperately, "At 
least, try to see my motives. Granted 
that I was foolish, criminally foolish, can't you understand? Can't 
you try not to hate me?" 

She said, softly, "I have tried 
not to love you and, as you see, I 
have failed." 

"Then you forgive me," he said. 

"Why? Because I understand? 
No! If it were a matter of simply 
understanding, of seeing your motives, I would not forgive you your 



actions for anything I might have 
in life. If it were only that and 
nothing more! But I will forgive 
you, Biron, because I couldn't bear 
not to. How could I ask you to 
come back to me, unless I forgave 
you?" 

And she was in his arms, her 
weather-cold lips turning up to 
his. The two were held apart by a 
double layer of thick garments. His 
gloved hands could not feel the 
body they embraced, but it didn't 
seem to lessen his ardor. 

At last he said in concern, "The 
sun is going down. It's going to 
get colder." 

But she said, softly, "It's strange 
then that I seem to be getting 
warmer." 

Together they walked back to the 
ship. 

BIRON faced the crew with an 
appearance of easy confidence 
which he did not feel. The Linganian ship was large, and there were 
fifty in the crew. They sat facing 
him. Fifty faces! Fifty Linganian 
faces bred to unquestioning obedience to their Autarch. 

Some had been convinced by Kizzett; others had been convinced by 
the arranged eavesdropping on the 
Autarch's statements to Biron earlier that day. But how many others 
were still uncertain or even definitely hostile? 

So far Biron's talking had done 
little good. He leaned forward, let 
his voice grow confidential. "And 



132 




 



what are you fighting for, men? 
What are you risking your lives 
for? A free Galaxy, I think. A Galaxy in which each world can decide what is best in its own way, 
produce its own wealth for its own 
good, be slave to none and master 
of none. Am I right?" 

There was a low murmur of what 
might have been agreement, but it 
lacked enthusiasm. 

Biron went on, "And what is the 
Autarch righting for? For himself. 
He is the Autarch of Lingane. If he 
won, he would be Autarch of the 
Nebular Kingdoms. You would replace a Khan by an Autarch. Where 
would be the benefit of that? Is that 
worth dying for?" 

One in the audience cried out, 
"He would be one of us, not a 
filthy Tyrannian." 

Another shouted, "The Autarch 
was looking for the 'Rebellion 
World' to offer his sen-ices. Was 
that ambition?" 

"Ambition should be made of 
sterner stuff, eh ?" Biron shouted 
back, ironically. "But he would 
come to the 'Rebellion World' with 
an organization at his back. He 
could offer them all of Lingane; he 
could offer them, he thought, the 
prestige of an alliance with the 
Hinriads. In the end, he was pretty 
sure, the 'Rebellion World' would 
be his to do with what he pleased. 
Yes, that was ambition. 

"And when the safety of the 
movement ran counter to his own 
plans, did he hesitate to risk your 



lives for the sake of his ambition ? 
My father was a danger to him. 
My father was honest and a friend 
of liberty. But he was too popular, 
so he was betrayed. In that betrayal, 
the Autarch might have brought to 
ruins the entire cause and all of 
you with it. Which one of you is 
safe under a man who will deal 
with the Tyranni whenever it suits 
his purposes ? Who can be safe serving a cowardly traitor?" 

"Better," whispered Rizzctt. 
"Stick to that. Give it to them." 

AGAIN the voice called from 
the back rows, "The Autarch 
knows where the 'Rebellion World* 
is. Do you know?" 

"We will discuss that later. 
Meanwhile, consider instead that 
under the Autarch we were all 
headed for complete ruin; that thereis still time to save ourselves by 
turning from his guidance to a better and nobler way; that it is still 
possible from the jaws of defeat to 
snatch — " 

"Only defeat, my dear young 
man," came a soft, interrupting 
voice, and Biron turned in horror. 

The fifty crew-men came babbling to their feet and, for a moment, it seemed as though they 
might surge forward, but they had 
come to council unarmed; Rizzett 
had seen to that. And now a squad 
of Tyranni guardsmen were filing 
through the various doors, weapons 
ready. 

And Simok Aratap, himself, a 



TYRANN 



133 



blaster in each hand, stood behind 
Biron and Rizzett. 

CHAPTER XX 

Where? 

SIMOK ARATAP weighed carefully the personalities of each 
of the four who faced him and felt 
the stirring of a certain excitement 
within him. This would be the big 
gamble. The threads of the pattern 
were weaving toward a close. He 
was thankful that Major Andros 
was no longer with him; that the 
Tyranni cruisers had gone as well. 

He was left with his flagship, his 
crew and himself. They would be 
sufficient. He hated any kind of unwieldiness. 

He spoke mildly. "Let me bring 
you up to date, my Lady and gentlemen. The Autarch's ship has 
been boarded by a prize crew and 
is now being escorted back to Tyrann by Major Andros. The Autarch's men will be tried according 
to law and, if convicted, will receive the punishment for treason. 
They are routine conspirators and 
will be treated routinely. But what 
shall I do with you?" 

Hinrik of Rhodia sat beside him, 
his face crumpled in utter misery. 
He said, "Consider that my daughter is a young girl. She was led into 
this unwittingly. Artemisia, tell 
them that you were — " 

"Your daughter," interposed Aratap, "'will probably be released. 



She is, I believe, the matrimonial 
object of a highly placed Tyranni 
nobleman. Obviously, that will be 
kept in mind." 

Artemisia said, "I'll marry him, 
if you let the rest go." 

Biron half-rose, but Aratap 
waved him down. The Tyrannian 
Commissioner smiled and said, "My 
Lady, please! I can strike bargains, 
I admit. However, I am not the 
Khan, but merely one of his servants. Therefore, any bargain I do 
make will have to be justified thoroughly at home. So what is it exactly that you offer?" 

"My agreement to the marriage." 

"That is not yours to offer. Your 
father has already agreed and that 
is sufficient. Do you have anything 
else ?" 

Aratap was waiting for the slow 
erosion of their wills-to-resist. The 
fact that he did not enjoy his roledid not prevent him from rilling it 
efficiently. The girl, for instance, 
might at this moment burst into 
tears and that would have a salutary 
effect on the young man. They were 
obviously in love. He wondered if 
old Pohang would want her under 
the circumstances, and decided that 
he probably would. The bargain 
would still be all in the ancient's 
favor. For a moment, Aratap 
thought distantly that the girl was 
very attractive. 

And she was maintaining equilibrium. She was not breaking 
down. Very good, thought Aratap. 
She was strong-willed as well. Po


134 




 



hang would not have joy of his 
bargain after all. 

He said to Hinrik, "Do you wish 
to plead lor your cousin, too?' 1 

Hinrik's lips moved soundlessly. 

Gillbret cried, "No one pleads 
for me. 1 don't want anything of 
any Tyrannian. Go ahead, order me 
shot." 

"You are hysterical," said Aratap. "You know that I cannot order 
you shot without trial." 

"He is my cousin," whispered 
Hinrik. 

"That will be considered too. 
You noblemen will someday have 
to learn that you cannot presume 
too far on your usefulness to us. I 
wonder if your cousin has learned 
that lesson yet." 

HE WAS satisfied with Gillbret's 
reactions. That fellow, at least, 
sincerely wanted death. The frustration of life was too much for him. 
Keep him alive, then, and that 
alone would break him. 

He paused thoughtfully before 
Rizzett. This was one of the Autarch's men. The thought made him 
feel a faint embarrassment. At the 
start of the chase, he had dismissed 
the Autarch as a factor on the basis 
of what seemed iron logic. Well, 
it was healthy to miss occasionally. 
It kept self-confidence balanced at 
a point safely short of arrogance. 

He said, "You're the fool who 
served a traitor. You would have 
been better off with us." 
Rizzett flushed. 

TYRANN 



Aratap went on, "If you ever had 
any military reputation, I am afraid 
this would destroy it. You are not 
a nobleman and so considerations of 
state will play no part in your case. 
Your trial will be public and it will 
become known that you were a tool 
of a tool. Too bad." 

Rizzett said, "But you were about 
to suggest a bargain, I suppose?" 

"A bargain?" 

"Khan's evidence, for instance? 
You have only a shipload. Wouldn't you want to know the rest of 
the machinery of revolt?" 

Aratap shook his head slightly. 
"No. We have the Autarch. He 
will do as a source of information. 
Even without it, we need only make 
war on Lingane. There would be 
little left of revolt thereafter, I'm 
sure. There will be no bargain of 
that sort." 

And this brought him to the 
young man. Aratap had left him 
for last because he was the cleverest 
of the lot. But he was young, and 
young people were usually not dangerous. They lacked patience. 

Biron spoke first, saying, "How 
did you follow us? Was he working with you?" 

"The Autarch? Not in this case. 
The poor fellow was trying to play 
both sides of the game." 

Hinrik interrupted, with an incongruously childish eagerness. 
"The Tyranni have an invention 
that follows ships through hyperspace." 

Aratap turned sharply. "If your 
135 



Excellency will refrain from interrupting, I would be obliged." Hinrik cringed. 

It really didn't matter. None of" 
these four would be dangerous hereafter, but Aratap had no desire to 
decrease by even one any of the uncertainties in the young^ man's mind. 

Biron said, "Now, look, let's 
have facts or nothing. You don't 
have us here because you love us.. 
Why aren't we on the way back to 
Tyrann with the others? It's that 
you don't know how to go about 
killing us. Two of us are Hinriads. 
I am a Widemos. Rizzett is a wellknown officer of the Linganian fleet. 
And that fifth one you have, your 
own pet coward and traitor, is still 
Autarch of Lingane. You can't kill 
any of us without stinking up the 
Kingdoms from Tyrann to the edge 
of the Nebula itself. You've got 
to try to make some sort of bargain 
with us because there's nothing else 
you can do." 

Aratap said, "You are not altogether wrong. Let me weave a pattern for you. We followed you; how 
is not important. You may disregard, I think, the Director's overactive imagination. You paused near 
three stars without landing on any 
planet. You came to a fourth and 
found a planet to land on. There 
we landed with you, watched, waited. We thought there might be 
something to wait for and we were 
right. You quarreled with the Autarch and both of you broadcast 
without limitation. That had been 



arranged by you for your own purposes, I know, but it suited our 
purpose as well. We overheard. 

"The Autarch said that only one 
last intra-nebular planet remained 
to be visited and that it must be 
the 'Rebellion World." This is interesting, you see. A 'Rebellion 
World.' You know, my curiosity is 
aroused. Where would that fifth 
and last planet be located?" 

HE let the silence last. He took 
a seat and watched them dispassionately; first one, then another. 

Biron said, "There is no 'Rebellion World.' " 

"You were looking for nothing 
then?" 

"We were looking for nothing." 

"You are being ridiculous." 

Biron shrugged wearily. "You 
are yourself ridiculous if you expect 
more of an answer." 

Aratap said, "Observe that this 
'Rebellion World' must be the center of the octopus of conspiracy. 
To find it is my only purpose in 
keeping you alive. You each have 
something to gain. My Lady, I 
might free you of your marriage. 
My Lord Gillbret, we might establish a laboratory for you; let you 
work undisturbed. Yes, we know 
more of you than you think." Aratap turned away hastily. The man's 
face was working. He might weep 
and that would be unpleasant. 
"Colonel Rizzett, you will be saved 
the humiliation of court-martial and 
the loss of reputation that would 



136 




 



go with it. You, Biron Farrill, 
would be Rancher of Widemos 
again. In your case, we might even 
reverse the conviction of your father." 

"And bring him back tr life?" 

"And restore his honor." 

"His honor," said Biron, "rests 
in the very actions that led to his 
conviction and death. It is beyond 
your power to add to or detract 
from it." 

Aratap said, "One of you four 
will tell me where to find this world 
you seek. One of you will be sensible. He will gain, whichever one it 
is, what I have promised. The rest 
of you will be married, imprisoned, 
executed, whatever will be worst 
for you. I warn you, I can be sadistic if I must be." He waited a moment. "Which one will it be? If 
you don't speak, the one next to 
you will. You will have lost everything and I will still have the information I want." 

Biron said, "It's no use. You're 
setting this up so carefully, and 
yet it won't help you. There is no 
'Rebellion World.' " 

"The Autarch says there is." 

"Then ask the Autarch your question." 

Aratap frowned. The young man 
was carrying the bluff past the point 
of reason. 

He said, "My own inclination is 
to deal with one of you." 

"Yet you have dealt with the 
Autarch in the past. Do so again. 
There is nothing you can sell to us 



that we are willing to buy from 
you." Biron looked about him. 

"Right?" 

Artemisia crept closer to him and 
her hand went slowly about his elbow. Rizzctt nodded curtly and 
Gillbret muttered, "Right!" in a 
breathless manner. 

"You have decided," said Aratap, 
and put his finger on the correct 
knob. 

THE Autarch's right wrist was 
immobilized in a light metal 
sheath, which was held magnetically 
tight to the metal band about his 
abdomen. The left side of his face 
was swollen and blue with bruises 
except for a ragged, force-healed 
scar /hat seamed it redly. He stood 
before them without moving after 
that first wrench which had freed 
his good arm from the grip of the 
armed guard at his side. 

"What do you want?" the Autarch demanded. 

"I will tell you in a moment," 
said Aratap. "First, I want you to 
consider your audience. See whom 
we have here. There is the young 
man, for instance, whom you 
planned death for, yet who lived 
long enough to cripple you and 
destroy your plans, although you 
were an Autarch and he was an 
exile." 

It was difficult to tell whether 
a flush had entered the Autarch's 
mangled face. There was no single 
muscle-motion upon it. 

Aratap did not look for one. He 



TYRANN 



137 



went on, quietly, almost indifferently. "This is Gillbret oth Hmriad, who saved the young man's 
life and brought him to you. This is 
the lady Artemisia, whom, I ara 
told, you courted in your most 
charming manner and who betrayed you, nevertheless, for the 
love of the youngster. This is Colonel Rizzett, your most trusted military aide, who also ended by betraying you. What do you owe these 
people, Autarch ?", 

The Autarch said again, "What 
do you want?" 

"Information. Give it to me and 
you will be Autarch again. Your 
earlier dealings with us would be 
held in your favor at the Khan's 
court. Otherwise — " 

"Otherwise?" 

"I will get it from these, you 
see. They will be saved and you 
will be executed. That is why I ask 
whether you owe them anything, 
that you should give them the opportunity of saving their lives by 
yourself being mistakenly stubborn." 

The Autarch's face twisted painfully into a smile. "They cannot 
save their lives at my expense. They 
do not know the location of the 
world you seek. I do." 

"I have not said what the information I want is, Autarch." 

"There is only one thing you can 
want." His voice was hoarse, all 
but unrecognizable. "If my decision 
is to speak, then my Autarchy will 
be as before, you say." 

138 



"More closely guarded, of 
course," amended Aratap, politely. 

Rizzett cried out, "Believe him, 
and you'll but add treason to treason and be killed for it in the end." 

The ^uard stepped forward, but 
Biron anticipated him. He flung 





 



himself upon Rizzett, struggling 
backward with him. 

"Don't be a fool," he warned. 
"There's nothing you can do." 

The Autarch said, "I don't care 
about my Autarchy, or myself, Rizzett." He turned to Aratap. "Will 



these be killed? That, at least, you 
must promise." His horridly discolored face twisted savagely. "That 
one, above all." His finger stabbed 
toward Biron. 

"If that is your price, it is met." 

"If I could be his executioner, I 




TYRANN 



139 



would relieve you of all further obligation to me. If my finder could 
control the execution-blast, it would 
be partial repayment. But if not 
that, at least I will tell you what 
he would have you not know. I 
give you rho, theta, and phi in parsees and radians: 7352.43, 1.7836, 
5.2112. Those three points will determine the position of the world 
you seek. You have them now." 

"So I have," said Aratap, writing 
them down. 

And Rizzett broke away. "Traitor!" 

B;ron, caught off-balance, lost his 
grip on the Linganian and was 
thrown to one knee. "Rizzett," he 
yelled, futilely. 

Rizzett, face distorted, struggled 
briefly with the guard. Other guards 
were swarming in, but Rizzett had 
the blaster now. With hands and 
knees, he struggled against the Tyranni soldiers. Hurling himself 
through the huddle of bodies, Biron 
joined the fight. He caught Rizzett's 
throat, choking, pulling back. 

"Traitor," Rizzett gasped, struggling to maintain aim as the Autarch tried desperately to squirm 
aside. He fired. And then they disarmed him and threw him on his 
back. 

BUT the Autarch's right shoulder 
and half his chest had been 
blasted away. Grotesquely, the forearm dangled freely from its magnetized sheath. Fingers, wrist and 
elbow ended in black ruin. For a 



long moment, it seemed that the 
Autarch's eyes flickered as his body 
remained in crazy balance, and then 
they were gla2ed and he dropped 
and was a charred remnant upon 
the floor. 

Artemisia buried her face against 
Biron's chest. Biron forced himself 
to look once, iirmly and without 
flinching, at the body of his father's murderer, then turned his 
eyes away. Hinrik, from a distant 
corner of the room, mumbled and 
giggled to himself. 

Only Aratap was calm. He said, 
"Remove the body." 

They did so, flaring the floor 
with a soft heat-ray for a few moments to remove the blood. Only 
a few scattered char-marks were 
left. 

The guards helped Rizzett to his 
feet. He brushed at himself with 
both hands, then whirled fiercely 
toward Biron. '"What were you doing? I almost missed the bastard." 

Biron said, wearily, "You fell 
into Aratap's trap, Rizzett" 

"Trap? I killed the traitor, didn't 
I?" • 

"That was the trap. You did Aratap a favor." 

Rizzett made no answer, and Aratap did not interfere. He listened 
with a certain pleasure. The young 
fellow's mind worked smoothly. 

Biron said, "If Aratap overheard 
what he claimed to have overheard, 
he would have known that only 
Jonti had the information he 
wanted. Jonti said that, with em



 



phasis, when he faced us after the 
fight. It was obvious that Aratap 
was questioning us only to rattle 
us, to get us to act brainlessly at 
the proper time. I was ready for 
the irrational impulse he counted 
upon. You were not." 

"I had thought," interposed Aratap softly, "that you would have 
done the job." 

"I," said Biron, "would have 
aimed at you." He turned to Rizzett again. "Don't you see that he 
didn't want the Autarch alive? The 
Tyranni are snakes. He wanted the 
Autarch's information; he didn't 
want to pay for it; he couldn't risk 
killing him. You very obligingly did 
it for him." 

"Correct," said Aratap, "and I 
have my information." 

Somewhere there was the sudden 
clamor of bells. 

Rizzett began, "All right. If I 
did him a favor, I did myself one 
at the same time." 

"Not quite," said the Commissioner, "since our young friend has 
not carried the analysis far enough. 
You see, a new crime has been committed. Where the only crime is 
treason against Tyrann, your disposal would be a delicate matter 
politically. But now that you have 
murdered the Autarch of Lingane, 
you may be tried, convicted, and executed by Linganian law and Tyrann need play no part in it. This 
will be convenient for — " 

And then he frowned and interrupted himself. He heard the clang


ing, stepped to the door and kicked 
the release. 

"What is happening?" 

A soldier saluted. "General 
alarm, sir. Storage compartments." 

"Fire ?" 

"It is not yet known, sir." 

Aratap thought to himself, 
"Great Galaxy!" and stepped back 
into the room. "Where is Gillbret?" 

It was the first anyone knew of 
his absence. 

THEY found him in the engine 
room, cowering amid the giant 
structures, and half-dragged, halfcarried him back to the Commissioner's room. 

The Commissioner said, dryly. 
"There is no escape on a ship, my 
Lord. It did you no good to sound 
the general alarm. The time of 
confusion is bound to be limited." 

He went on, "I think it is 
enough. We have kept the cruiser 
you stole, Farrill, my own cruiser, 
on board ship. It will be used to 
explore the 'Rebellion World." We 
will make for the lamented Autarch's reference points as soon as 
the Jump can be calculated. This 
will be an adventure of a sort 
usually missing in this comfortable 
generation of ours." 

There was the sudden thought 
in his mind of his father in command of a squadron, conquering 
worlds. He was glad Andros was 
gone. This adventure would be his 
aione. 



TYRANN 



141 



THEY were separated after that. 
Artemisia was placed with her 
father, and Rizzett and Biron were 
marched off in opposite directions. 

Gillbret struggled and screamed. 
"I won't be left alone. I won't be 
in solitary." 

Aratap sighed. This man's grandfather had been a great ruler, the 
history books said. It was degrading 
to have to watch such a scene. He 
said, with distaste, "Put my Lord 
with one of the others." 

And so Gillbret was put with 
Biron. There was no speech between them till the coming of spaceship "night" when the lights turned 
a dim purple. It was bright enough 
to allow them to be watched 
through the televiewing system by 
the guards, shift and shift about, 
yet dim enough to allow sleep. 

But Gillbret did not sleep. "Biron," he whispered. "Biron." 

Biron, roused from a dull semidrowse, said, "What do you want?" 

"Biron, I have done it. It is all 
right, Biron." 

Biron said, "Try to sleep, Gil." 
But Gillbret insisted. "But I've 
done it, Biron. Aratap may be 
smart, but I'm smarter. Isn't that 
amusing? You don't have to worry, 
Biron. Biron, don't worry. I've fixed 
it." 

He was shaking Biron again, feverishly. 

Biron sat up. "What's the matter with you?" 

"Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
It's all right. But I was the one 



who fixed it." Gillbret was smiling. 
It was a sly smile, the smile of a 
little boy who had done something 
clever. 

"What have you fixed?" Biron 
was on his feet. He seized the other 
by the shoulders and dragged him 
upright. "Answer me!" 

"They found me in the engine 
room." The words were jerked out. 
"They thought I was hiding. I 
wasn't. I sounded the general alarm 
for the storage room, because I had 
to be alone, but for just a few minutes. I shorted the hyperatomics." 

"You what?" 

"It was easy. It took a minute. 
And they won't know. I did it 
cleverly. They won't know until 
they try to Jump, and then all the 
fuel will be energy in one chain reaction and die ship and us and 
Aratap and all knowledge of the 
'Rebellion World' will be a thin 
expansion of iron vapor." 

Biron was backing away, eyes 
wide. "You did that?" 

"Yes." Gillbret buried his head 
in his hands and rocked to and fro. 
"Well be dead, Biron. I'm not 
afraid to die, but not alone. I had 
to be with someone. I'm glad I'm 
with you. I want to be with someone when I die. But it won't hurt; 
it will be so quick." 

Biron said, "You're mad. We 
might still have won out!" 

Gillbret didn't hear him. His ears 
were filled with his own moans. 

Biron could only dash to the 
door. "Guard," he yelled. "Guard!" 



142 




 



Were there hours or merely minutes left? 

CHAPTER XXI 

Here? 

THE soldier came clattering 
down the corridor. "Get back 
in there!" His voice was sharp. 

They stood facing one another. 
There were no doors to the small 
bottom-level rooms which doubled 
as prison cells, but a force-field 
stretched from side to side, top to 
bottom. Biron could feel it with 
his hand. There was a resilience to 
it, like rubber stretched nearly to 
its extreme, and then it stopped 
giving as though the first initial 
pressure turned it to steel. 

•It tingled Biron's hand, and he 
knew that though it would stop 
matter completely, it would be as 
transparent as space to the energy 
beam of a neuronic whip. And there 
was a whip in the guard's hand. 

Biron said, "I've got to see Commissioner Aratap." 

"Is that what you're making a 
noise about?" The guard was not 
in the best of humor; the night 
watch was unpopular and he was 
losing at cards. "I'll mention it after 
lights-on." 

"It won't wait." Biron felt desperate. "It's important." 

"It will have to wait. Will you 
get back, or do you want a bit of 
the whip?" 

"Look," said Biron, "the man 



with me is Gillbret oth Hinriad. He 
is sick. He may be dying. If a 
Hinriad dies on a Tyrannian ship 
because you will not let me speak 
to the man in authority, you will 
not have -i good time of it." 

"What's wrong with him?" 

"I don't know. Will you be 
quick or are you tired of life?" 

The guard mumbled something 
and went off. 

Biron watched him as far as he 
could see in the dim purple. He 
strained his ears in an attempt to 
catch the heightened throbbing of 
the engines as energy concentration 
climbed to a pre-Jump peak, but he 
heard nothing at all. 

He strode to Gillbret, seized the 
man's hair and pulled the head back 
gently. Eyes stared into his own out 
of a contorted face. There was no 
recognition in them; only fear. 

"Who are you?" 

"It's only me, Biron. How do 
you feel?" 

It took time for the words to 
penetrate. Gillbret said, blankly, 
"Biron?" Then, with a cjuivcr of 
life, "Biron! Are they Jumping? 
Death won't hurt, Biron." 

Biron let the head drop. No point 
in anger against Gillbret. But he 
was writhing in frustration. Why 
wouldn't they let him speak to Aratap? Why wouldn't they let him 
out? He found himself at a wall 
and beat upon it with his fists. If 
there were a door, he could break 
it down; if there were bars, he could 
pull them apart, or drag them out 



TYRANN 



143 



of their sockets, by the Galaxy. 

But there was a force-field which 
nothing could damage. He would 
yell again! 

There were footsteps once more 
He rushed to the open-yet-not-opci 
door. He could not look out to see 
who was coming down the corridor. 
He could only wait. 

IT WAS the guard again. "Get 
back from the field," he barked. 
"Step back with your hands in front 
of you." There was an officer with 
him. 

Biron retreated. The other's neuronic whip was on him, unwaveringly. Biron said, "The other man 
with you is not Aratap. I want to 
speak to the Commissioner." 

The officer said, "If Gillbrct oth 
Hinriad is ill, you don't want to 
see the Commissioner. You want to 
see a doctor." 

The force-field was down, with 
a dim blue spark showing as contact 
broke. The officer entered and Biron could see the Medical Group 
insignia on his uniform, 

Biron stepped in front of him. 
"All right, now listen to me. This 
ship mustn't Jump. The Commissioner is the only one who can see 
to that, and I must speak to him. 
Do you understand that? You're 
an officer. Have him awakened." 

The doctor put out an arm to 
brush Biron aside, and Biron batted 
it away. The doctor cried out sharply and called, "Guard, get this man 
out of here." 



THE guard stepped forward and 
Biron dived. They went thumping down together, and Biron 
swarmed up along the guard's body, 
seizing first the shoulder and then 
the wrist of the arm that was trying to bring its whip down upon 
him. 

For a moment, they remained 
frozen, straining against one another, and then Biron caught motion at the corner of his eye. The 
medical officer was rushing past 
them to sound the alarm. 

Biron's hand, the one not holding the other's whip-wrist, shot out 
and seized the officer's ankle. The 
guard writhed nearly free, and the 
officer kicked out wildly at him, 
but, with the veins standing out 
on his neck and temples, Biron 
pulled desperately with each hand. 

The officer went down, shouting 
hoarsely. The guard's whip clattered to the floor with a harsh 
sound. Biron fell upon it, rolled 
with it, and came up on his knees 
and one hand. In his other was the 
whip, 

"Not a sound," he gasped. "Not 
one sound. Drop anything else 
you've got." 

The guard, staggering to his 
feet, his tunic ripped, glared hatred 
and tossed a short, metal -weighted, 
plastic club away from himself. The 
doctor was unarmed. 

Biron gathered up the club. He 
said, "Sorry. I have nothing to tie 
and gag you with and no time anyway." 




 



The whip flashed dimly once, 
twice. .First the guard and then the 
doctor stiffened in agonized immobility and dropped solidly, in 
one piece, legs and arms bent 
grotesquely out from their bodies 
in the attitude they had last assumed before the whip struck. 

BIRON turned to Gillbret, who 
was watching with dull, soundless vacuity. 

"Sorry," said Biron, "but you, 
too, Gillbret," and the whip flashed 
a third time. 

The vacuous expression was 
frozen solid as Gillbret lay there 
on his side. 

The force-field was still down 
an d B i ron s tepped out into th e 
corridor. It was empty. Only the 
watch and the night-details would 
be up. There would be no time to 
try to locate Aratap. It would have 
to be straight for the engine room. 
He set off toward the bow. 
A man in engineer's workclothes hurried past him. 

"When's the next Jump?" called 
out Biron. 

"About half an hour," the engineer returned over his shoulder. 
"Engine room straight ahead?" 
"And up the ramp." The man 
turned suddenly. "Who are you?" 

Biron did not bother to answer. 
The whip flared a fourth time. He 
stepped over the body and went 
on. Half an hour left 

He heard the noise of men as he 
sped up the steep ramp. The light 

TYRANN 



.ahead was white, not purple. He 
hesitated. Then he put the whip 
into his pocket. They would be 
busy. There would be no reason for 
them to suspect him. 

He stepped in quickly. The men 
were pigmies scurrying about the 
huge matter-energy converters. The 
room glared with dials; a hundred 
thousand eyes staring their information out to all who would look. 
A ship this size, one almost in the 
class of a large passenger liner, 
was considerably different from the 
tiny Tyrannian cruiser he had been 
used to. There the engines had 
been all but automatic. Here they 
were large enough to power a city, 
and required considerable supervision. 

He was on a railed balcony that 
circled the engine room. In one 
corner there was a small room in 
which two men handled computers 
with flying fingers. He hurried in 
that direction, while engineers 
passed him without looking at him. 

He stepped through the door. 
The two at the computers looked 
at him. 

"What's up?" one, a lieutenant, 
said. "What are you doing here? 
Get back to your post." 

Biron said, "The hyperatomics 
have been shorted. They've got to 
be repaired." 

"Hold on," said the second. "I've 
seen this man. He's one of the 
prisoners. Hold him, Lancy." 

He jumped up and was making 
his way out the other door. Biron 

145 



hurdled the desk and the computer, 
seized the belt of the controlman's 
tunic and pulled him backward. 

"Correct," he said. "I'm one of 
the prisoners. I'm Biron of Widemos. But what I say is true. The 
hypcratomics are shorted. Have 
them inspected, if you don't believe me." 

The lieutenant found himself 
staring at a neuronic whip. He said, 
carefully, "It can't be done, sir, 
without orders from the Otticer of 
the Day. or from the Commissioner. 
It would mean changing the Jump 
calculations and delaying us for 
hours." 

"Get the authority then. Get the 
Commissioner." 

"May I use the communicator?" 
"Hurry." 

The lieutenant's arm reached out 
for the flaring mouthpiece of the 
communicator, and, halfway there, 
plummeted down hard upon the 
row of knobs at one end of his 
desk. Bells clamored in every corner of the ship. 

Biron's club was too late. It 
came down hard upon the lieutenant's wrist. The lieutenant snatched 
it away, moaning over it, but the 
warning signals were sounding. 

GUARDS were rocketing in 
upon the balcony through 
every entrance. Biron slammed out 
of the control room, looked in 
either direction, then hopped the 
railing. 

He plummeted down, landing 



with knees bent, and rolled. He 
rolled as rapidly as he could to prevent setting himself up as a target. 
He heard the soft hissing of a 
needle-gun near his ear, and then 
he was in the shadow of one of 
the engines. 

He stood up in a crouch, huddling beneath its curve. His right 
leg was a stabbing pain. Gravity 
was high near the ship's hull and 
the drop had been a long one; he 
had sprained his knee badly. It 
meant that there would be no more 
chase. If he won out, it was to be 
from where he stood. 

He shouted, "Hold your fire! I 
am unarmed." First the club and 
then the whip he had taken from 
the guard went spinning toward the 
center of the engine room. They 
lay there in hard impotence and 
plain view. "The hyper atomics are 
shorted. A Jump will mean the 
death of us all. I ask only that you 
check the motors. You will lose a 
few hours, perhaps, if I am wrong. 
You will save your lives if I am 
right." 

Someone called, "Go down there 
and get him." 

Biron yelled, "Will you sell your 
lives rather than listen?" 

He heard the cautious sound of 
many feet, and shrank back. Then 
there was a frictional sound above. 
A soldier was sliding down the 
engine toward him, hugging its 
faintly warm skin as though it were 
a b rid e. B i ron wa i ted . He coul d 
still use his arms. 




 



And then the voice came, from 
above, unnaturally loud, penetrating every corner of the huge room. 
It said, "Back to your places. Halt 
preparations for the Jump. Check 
the hyperatomics." 

It was Aratap, speaking through 
the public address system. The order then came, "Bring the young 
man to me." 

Biron allowed himself to be 
taken. There were two soldiers on 
each side, holding him as thosgh 
they expected him to explode. He 
tried to force himself to walk naturally, but he was limping in pain. 

ARATAP was only in semi-dress. 
His eyes seemed different; 
faded, peering, unfocused. It occurred to Biron that the man wore 
contact lenses. 

Aratap said, "You have created 
quite a stir, Farrill." 

"It was necessary to save our 
lives. Send these guards away. As 
long as the engines are being investigated, there's nothing more I 
intend doing." 

"They will stay just a while. At 
least, until I hear from my enginemen." 

They waited, silently, as the minutes dragged on, and then there 
was the flash of red upon the frosted-glass circle above the glowing 
lettering that read "Engine Room." 

Aratap opened contact. "Make 
your report!" 

The words that came were crisp 
and hurried. "Hyperatomics on the 



C Bank completely shorted. Repairs under way." 

Aratap said, "Have Jump recalculated for plus six hours." He 
turned to Biron coolly. "You were 
right." 

He gestured. The guards saluted, turned on their heels, and left 
one by one with a smooth precision. 

Aratap said, "The details, 
please." 

"Gillbret oth Hinriad, during his 
stay in the engine room, thought 
the shorting to be a good idea. The 
man is not responsible for his actions and must not be punished 
for it." 

Aratap nodded. "He has not been 
considered responsible for years. 
That portion of the events will remain between you and me only. 
However, my interest and curiosity 
are aroused by your reasons for 
preventing the destruction of the 
ship. You are surely not afraid to 
die in a good cause." 

"There is no cause," said Biron. 
"There is no 'Rebellion World.' I 
have told you so already and I repeat it. Lingane was the center of 
revolt and that has been checked. 
I was interested only in tracking 
down my father's ' murderer, the 
lady Artemisia only in escaping an 
utiwanted marriage. As for Gillbret, he is mad." 

"Yet the Autarch believed in the 
existence of this mysterious planet. 
Surely, he gave me the co-ordinates 
of something." 

"His belief is based on a mad


TVRANN 



147 



man's dream. Gillbrct dreamed 
something twenty years ago. Using 
that as a basis, the Autarch calculated five possible planets as the 
site of this dream-world. It is all 
nonsense." 

The Commissioner said, "And 
vet something disturbs me." 

"What?" 

"You are working so hard to persuade me. Surely, I will find all 
this out tor myself once I have 
made the Jump. It is not impossible 
that, in desperation, one of you 
might endanger the ship and the 
other save it as a complicated 
method for convincing me that I 
need look no farther for the 'Rebellion World.' I would say to myself: If there were really such a 
world, young Farrill would have let 
the ship vaporize, for he is a young 
man and romantically capable of 
dying what he would consider a 
hero's death. Since he has risked 
his life to prevent that happening 
Gillbret is mad, there is no 'Rebellion World' and I will return 
without further searching. Am I 
too complicated for you?" 

"No. I understand you." 

"And since you have saved our 
lives, you will receive appropriate 
consideration in the Khan's Court. 
You will have saved your life and 
your cause. No, young sir, I am 
not quite so ready to believe the 
obvious. We will still make the 
Jump." 

"I have no objections," said 
Biron. 



"You are cool," said Aratap. 
"It is a pity you were not born 
one of us." He meant it as ;i compliment. "We'll take you back to 
your cell now, and replace the 
force-field. A simple precaution." 

rpHE guard that Biron had 
J- knocked out was no longer 





 



there when they returned to the 
prison room, but the doctor was. 
He was bending over the still unconsci ous form of G i 1 1 bre t . 

Aratap said, "Is he still under?" 

At his voice, the doctor jumped 
up. "The effects of the whip have 
worn off, Commissioner, but the 
man is not young and has been 
under a strain. I don't know if he 
wHl recover." 

Biron felt horror fill him. He 
dropped to his knees, disregarding the wrenching pain, and 
reached out a hand to touch Gillbret*s shoulder gently. 

"Gil," he whispered. He 
watched the other's damp, white 
face anxiously. 



"Out of the way, man." The 
Medical Officer was scowling at 
him. He removed the black medical wallet from an inner pocket. 

"At least the hypodermics aren't 
broken," he grumbled. He leaned 
over Gillbrer, the hypodermic, 
filled with its colorless fluid, 
poised. It sank deep, and the 
plunger pressed inward automatically. The doctor tossed it aside 
and they waited. 

Gillbret's eyes flickered, then 
opened. For a while, they stared 
unseeingly. When he spoke 
finally, his voice was a whisper. 
"I can't see, Biron. I can't see." 

Biron leaned close again. "It's 
all right, Gil. Just rest." 

"I don't want to." He tried to 



TYRANN 



1-19 



struggle upright. "Biron, when are 
they Jumping?" 
"Soon, soon!" 

. "Stay with me, then. I don't 
want to die alone." His fingers 
clutched feebly, and then relaxed. 
His head lolled backward. 

The doctor stooped, then 
straightened, "We were too late." 

Tears stung at Biron's eyelids. 
"I'm sorry, Gil," he said. "You 
didn't know. You didn't understand." 

THEY were hard hours for 
Biron. Aratap had refused to 
allow him to attend the ceremonies 
involved in the burial of a body at 
space. Somewhere in the ship, he 
knew, Gillbret's body would be 
blasted in an atomic furnace and 
then exhausted into space, where 
its atoms might mingle forever 
with the thin wisps of interstellar 
matter. 

Artemisia and Hinrik would be 
there. Would they understand? 
Would she understand that he had 
done only what he had to do? 

The doctor had injected the 
cartilaginous extract that would 
hasten the healing of Biron's torn 
ligaments and already the pain in 
his knee were barely noticeable, 
but, then, that was only physical 
pain, anyway. Given a strong will, 
it could be ignored. 

He felt the inner disturbance 
that meant the ship had lumped 
and then the worst time came. 



Earlier he had thought his own 
analysis to be correct. It bad to be. 
But what if he were wrong? What 
if they were now at the very heart 
of rebellion? Trie information 
would go streaking back to Tyrann 
and the armada would gather. And 
he himself would die knowing that 
he might have saved the rebellion; 
but had risked death to ruin it. 

It was during that dark time that 
he thought of the document again. 
The document he had once failed 
to get. 

Strange the way the notion of 
the document came and went. It 
would be mentioned and then forgotten. There was a mad, intensive 
search for a "Rebellion World" and 
yet no search at all for the mysterious vanished document. 

Was the emphasis being misplaced ? 

It occurred to Biron then that 
Aratap was willing to come upon 
the "Rebellion World" with a 
single ship. What was that confidence he had? Could he dare a 
planet with a ship? 

The Autarch had said the document had vanished years before, 
but then who had it? The Tyranni? 
Did they have a document the 
secret of which would allow one 
ship to destroy a world? 

If that were true, it would no 
longer matter where the "Rebellion 
World" was, or if it existed at all. 

Time passed and finally Aratap 
entered. Biron got to his feet.

Aratap said, "We have reached 
the star in question. There is a star 
there. The co-ordinates given us by 
the Autarch were correct." 

"Well ?" 

"But there is no need to inspect 
it for planets. The star, I am told 
by my astrogators, was a nova less 
than a million years ago. If it had 
planets then, they were destroyed. 
It is a white dwarf now. It can 
have no planets." 

Biron stared. "Then — " 

Aratap said, "So you are right. 
There is no 'Rebellion World.' " 

CHAPTER XXII 

There! 

ALL of Aratap's philosophy 
could not completely wipe out 
the feeling of regret within him. 
For a while, he had not been himself, but his father over again. He, 
too, these last weeks had been 
leading a squadron of ships against 
the enemies of the Khan. 

But these were degenerate days 
and where there might have been a 
"Rebellion World," there was 
none. There were no enemies of 
the Khan after all; no worlds to 
gain. He remained only a Commissioner, a politician, still condemned 
to the soothing of little troubles. 
No more. 

Yet regret was a useless emotion. 
It accomplished nothing. 

He sat down and motioned Biron 



into a seat as well. "I want to talk 
to you."
The young man was staring 
solemnly at him, and Aratap found 
himself somewhat amazed that 
they had met first less than a month 
ago. The boy was older now, far 
more than a month older, and he 
had lost his fear. Aratap thought 
to himself, "I am growing completely decadent. How many of us 
are beginning to like individuals 
among our subjects? How many 
of us wish them well?" 

He said, "I am going to release 
the Director and his daughter. 
Naturally, it is the politically intelligent thing to do. In fact, it is 
politically inevitable. I think, 
though, that I will release them 
now and send them back, on the 
Remorseless. Would you care to 
pilot them?" 

Biron said, "Are you freeing 
me?" 

"Yes." 

"Why?" 

"You saved my ship; and my 
life as well." 

'T doubt that personal gratitude 
would influence your actions in 
matters of state." 

Aratap was within a hair of 
laughing outright. He did like the 
boy. "Then I'll give you another 
reason. As long as I was tracking 
a giant conspiracy against the 
Khan, you were dangerous. When 
that giant conspiracy failed to materialize; when all I had was a Lin


TYRANN 



ganian cabal of which the leader 
is dead; you were no longer dangerous. In fact, it would be dangerous to try either you or the 
Linganian captives. 

"The trials would be in Linganian courts and therefore not under 
our full control. They would inevitably involve discussion of the 
so-called 'Rebellion World.' And 
though there is none, half the subjects of Tyrann would have a concept to rally round, a reason for 
revolt, a hope for the future. The 
Tyranni realm would not be free 
of rebellion this side of a century." 

"rpHEN you free us all?" 

J- "It will not be exactly 
freedom since none of you are exactly loyal. We will deal with Lingane in our own way, and the next 
Autarch will find himself bound 
by closer ties to the Khan. It will 
be no longer an 'Associated 
Power' and trials involving Liaganians will not necessarily be 
tried in Linganian courts hereafter. Those involved in the conspiracy, including those in our 
hands now, will be exiled to 
worlds nearer Tyrann where they 
will be fairly harmless. You, for 
example, cannot return to Nephelos and need not expect to be restored to your Ranchy. You will 
stay on Rhodia, along with 
Colonel Riz2ett." 

"Good enough," said Biron, 
"but what of the lady Artemisia's 



marriage to that — nobleman ?" 

"You wish it stopped?" 

"You know that we would like 
to marry each other. You said 
once there might be some way of 
stopping the Tyranni affair." 

"At the time I said that I was 
trying to accomplish something. 
What is the old saying? 'The lies 
of lovers and diplomats shall be 
forgiven them.' " 

"But there is a way. Commissioner. It need only be pointed 
out to the Khan that when a powerf ul court ier would marry into 
an important subject family, it 
may be motives of ambition that 
lead him on. A revolt may be led 
by an ambitious Tyrannian as easily 
as by an ambitious Linganian." 

Aratap did laugh this time. 
"You reason like one of us. But 
it wouldn't work. Would you 
want my advice?" 

"What would it be?" 

"Marry her yourself, quickly. 
A thing once done would be 
difficult to undo under the circumstances. We would have to find 
another woman for Pohang." 

Biron hesitated. Then he put 
out a hand. "Thank you, sir." 

Aratap took it. "I don't like 
Pohang particularly, anyway. Still, 
there is one thing .further for you 
to remember. Don't let ambition 
mislead you. Though you marry 
the Director's daughter, you will 
never yourself be Director. You 
are not the type." 



152 




 



ARATAP watched the shrinking Remorseless in the visiplate and was glad the decision 
had been made. The young man 
was free; a message was already 
on its way to Tyrann through the 
sub-ether. Major Andros would 
undoubtedly swell into apoplexy, 
and there would undoubtedly be 
men at court to demand his recall 
as Commissioner. 

If necessary, he would travel to 
Tyrann. Somehow he would see the 
Khan and make him listen. Given 
all the facts, the King of Kings 
would see plainly that no other 
course of action was possible, and 
thereafter Aratap could defy any 
possible combination of enemies. 



The Remorseless was only a 
gleaming dot now, scarcely distinguishable from the stars that were 
beginning to surround it now that 
they were- emerging from the Nebula. 

Rizzett watched the shrinking 
Tyrannian flagship in the visiplate. 

He said, "So the man let us go! 
You know, if the Tyranni were all 
like him, damned if I wouldn't join 
their fleet. It upsets me in a way. I 
have definite notions of what Tyranni are like, and he doesn't fit. 
Do you suppose he can hear what 
we say?" 

Biron set the automatic controls 
and swiveled in the pilot's seat. "Of 
course not. He can follow us

through hyper-space as he did before, but I don't think he can put a 
spy beam on us. You remember 
that when he first captured us, all 
he knew about us was what he 
overheard on the fourth planet. No 
more." 

Artemisia stepped into the pilot 
room, her finger on her lips. "Not 
too loudly," she said. "I think he's 
sleeping now. It won't be long before we reach Rhodia, will it, 
Biron?" 

"We can do it in one Jump, Arta. 
Aratap had it calculated for us." 

Rizzett said, "I've got to wash 
my hands." 

They watched him leave, and 
then she was in Biron's* arms. He 
kissed her on forehead and eyes, 
then found her lips as his arms 
tensed about her. The kiss came to 
a lingering and breathless end. She 
said, "I love you very much," and 
he said, "I love you more than I 
can say." The conversation that 
followed was both as unoriginal as 
that and as satisfying. 

Biron said after a while, "Will 
he marry us before we land?" 

Artemisia frowned a little. "I 
tried to explain that he's Director 
and captain of the ship and that 
there are no Tyranni here. I don't 
know, though; he's quite upset. 
After he's rested, I'll try again." 

Biron laughed softly. "Don't 
worry. He'll be persuaded." 

Rizzett's footsteps were noisy as 
he returned. He said, "I wish we 
still had the trailer." 



Biron said, "We'll be on Rhodia 
in a matter of hours. We'll be 
Jumping soon." 

"I know." Rizzett scowled. 
"And we'll stay on Rhodia till we 
die. Not that I'm complaining overloud; I'm glad I'm alive. But it's 
a silly end to it all." 

"rpHERE hasn't been any endX ing," said Biron, softly. 
Rizzett looked up. "You mean 
we can start all over? No, I don't 
think so. You can, perhaps, but 
not I. I'm too old and there's nothing left for me. Lingane will be 
dragged into line and I'll never see 
it again. That bothers me most of 
all, I think. I was born there and 
lived there all my life. I won't be 
but half a man anywhere else. 
You're young; you'll forget Nephelos." 

"There's more to life than a 
home planet, Tedor. It's been our 
great shortcoming in the past centuries that we've been unable to 
recognize that fact. All planets are 
our home planets." 

"Maybe. I don't know. If there 
bad been a 'Rebellion World,' why, 
then, it might have been so." 

"There is a 'Rebellion World,' 
Tedor." 

Rizzett said, sharply, "I'm in no 
mood for that, Biron." 

"It's the truth. There is such a 
world and I know its location. I 
might have known it weeks ago, 
and so might anyone in our party. 
The facts were all there. They were

knocking at my mind without being 
able to get in until that moment on 
the fourth planet when you and I 
had beaten down Jonti. Do you remember him standing there, saying 
that we would never find the fifth 
planet, without -his help? Do you 
remember his words?" 
"Exactly? No." 

"I think I do. He said, 'There is 
an average of seventy cubic light 
years per star. If you work by trial 
and error, without me, the odds are 
two hundred fifty quadrillion to 
one against your coming within a 
billion miles of any star. Any star!' 
It was at that moment, I think, that 
the facts got into my mind. I could 
feel the click." 

"Nothing clicks in my mind," 
objected Rizzett. "Suppose you explain a bit." 

Artemisia said, "I don't know 
what you mean, Biron.' 

"Don't you see that it is exactly 
those odds which Gillbret is supposed to have defeated ? You 
remember his story. The meteor 
hit, deflected his ship's course, and 
at the end of its Jumps, it was actually uithin a stellar system. That 
could have happened only by an 
incredible coincidence." 

( <rpH£N it uas a madman's story 
J- and there is no 'Rebellion 
World'.'" 

"Unless there is a condition under which the odds against landing 
within a stellar system are less incredible," said Biron, "and there is

such a condition. In fact, there is 
one set of circumstances, and only 
one, under which he must have 
reached a system. It would have 
been inevitable." 
"Well?" 

"You remember the Autarch's 
reasoning. The engines of Gillbret's 
ship were not interfered with, so 
the power of the hyperatomic 
thrusts — or, in other words, the 
length of the Jumps — remained unchanged. Only their direction was 
changed in such a way that one of 
five stars in a cosmically vast area 
of the Nebula was reached. It was 
an interpretation which, on the 
very face of it, was improbable." 

"But the alternative?" 

"Why, that neither -power nor 
direction was altered. There is no 
real reason to suppose the direction of drive to have been interfered with. That was only assumption. What if the ship had simply 
followed its original course? It had 
been aimed at a stellar system; 
therefore it ended in a stellar system. The matter of odds doesn't 
enter." 

"But the stellar system it was 
aimed at — " 

"Was that of Rhodia. So he went 
to Rhodia. It's so obvious that it's 
difficult to grasp." 

Artemisia said, "But then the 
'Rebellion World' must be at home. 
That's impossible." 

"Why impossible? It is somewhere in the Rhodian system. There 
are two ways of hiding an object. 



You can put it where no one can 
find it, as, for instance, within the 
Horsehead Nebula. Or else you can 
put it where no one would ever 
think of looking, right in front of 
their eyes. 

"Consider what happened to 
Gillbret after landing on the 'Rebellion World.' He was returned 
to Rhodia alive. His theory was 
that this was in order to prevent a 
Tyranni search for the ship which 
might come dangerously close to 
the 'World' itself. But then why 
was he kept alive? If the ship had 
been returned with Gillbret dead, 
the same purpose would have been 
accomplished and there would have 
been no chance of Gillbret's talking, as, eventually, he did. 

"Again that can only be explained by supposing the 'Rebellion World' to be within the Rhodian system. Gillbret was a Hinriad and where else would there 
be such respect for the life of a 
Hinriad but in Rhodia?" 

ARTEMISIA'S hands clenched 
spasmodically. "But if what 
you say is true* Biron, then father 
is in terrible danger." 

"And has been for twenty years," 
agreed Biron. "But perhaps not in 
the manner you think. Gillbret 
once told me how difficult it was 
to pretend to be a dilletante, to 
pretend so hard that one had to live 
the part even with friends and even 
when alone. Of course, with him, 
poor fellow, it was largely self



 



dramatization. He didn't really act. 
His real self came out easily 
enough with you, Arta. It showed 
to the Autarch. He even found it 
necessary to show it to me on fairly short acquaintance. 

"But it is possible, I suppose, to 
really live such a life completely, 
if your reasons are sufficiently important. A man might live a lie 
even to his daughter; be willing to 
see her miserably married rather 
than risk a lite-work that depended 
on complete Tyranni trust; be willing to seem half a madman — " 

Artemisia said, huskily, "You 
can't mean what you're saying." 

"There is no other meaning possible, Arta. He has been Director 



over twenty years. In that time, 
Rhodia has been continually 
strengthened by territory granted it 
by the Tyranni, because they felt it 
would be safe with him. For 
twenty years, he has organized rebellion without interference from 
them, because he was so obviously 
harmless." 

"You're guessing, Biron," said 
Rizzett, "and this kind of guess is 
as dangerous as the ones we've 
made before." 

Biron said, "This is no guess. I 
told Jonti in that last discussion of 
ours that he, not the Director, must 
have been the traitor who murdered 
my father — because my father 
would never have been foolish

enough to trust the Director with 
any incriminating information. But 
the point is — and I knew it at the 
time — that this was just what my 
father did. GiUbret learned of 
Jonti's conspiratorial role through 
what he overheard in the discussions between my father and the 
Director. There is no other way in 
which he could have learned it 

"But a stick points both ways. 
Wc thought my father was working with Jonti and trying to enlist 
the support of the Director. Why is 
it not equally probable, or even 
more probable, that he was working with the Director— and that his 
role within Jonti's organization was 
as an agent of the 'Rebellion 
World,' attempting to prevent a 
premature explosion on Linganc 
that would ruin two decades of 
careful planning? 

"Why do you suppose it seemed 
so important to me to save Aratap's 
ship, when Gillbret shorted the motors? It wasn't for myself. I didn't, 
at the time, think Aratap would 
free me, no matter what. It wasn't 
even for you, Arta. It was to save 
the Director. He was the important 
man among us. Poor Gillbret 
didn't understand that." 

RIZZETT shook his head. "I'm 
sorry. I just can't make myself 
believe all that." 

It was a new voice that spoke. 
"You may as well. It is true." The 
Director was standing just outside 
the door, tall and somber-eyed. It 



was his voice and yet not quite his 
voice, for it was crisp and sure of 
itself. 

Artemisia ran to him. "Father! 
Biron says — " 

"I heard what Biron said." He 
was stroking her hair. "And it is 
true. I would even have let your 
marriage take place." 

She stepped back from him, almost in embarrassment. "You 
sound so different. You sound almost as if — " 

-"As if I weren't your father." 
He said it sadly. "It will not be 
for long, Arta. When we are back 
on Rhodia, I will be as you knew 
me and you must accept me so." 

Rizzett stared at him, his usually 
ruddy complexion as gray as his 
hair. Biron was holding his breath. 

Hinrik said, "Come here, Biron." 
He placed a hand on Biron's shoulder. "There was a time, young man, 
when I was ready to sacrifice your 
life. The time may come again in 
the future. Until a certain day, I 
can protect neither of you. I can 
be nothing but what I have always 
seemed. Do you understand that?" 

Each nodded. 

"Unfortunately," said Hinrik, 
"damage has been done. Twenty 
years ago, I was not as hardened 
to my role as I am today. I should 
have ordered Gillbret killed, but 
I could not. Because I did not, it is 
now known that there is a 'Rebellion World' and I am its leader." 

"Only wc know that," said 
Biron. 



153 




 



Hinrik smiled bitterly. "You 
think that because you are young. 
Do you think Aratap is less intelligent than yourself? The reasoning 
by which you determined the location and leadership of the 'Rebellion World' is based on facts known 
to him, and he can reason as well 
as you. It is merely that he is 
older, more cautious, that he has 
grave responsibilities. He must be 
certain. 

"Do you think he released you 
out of sentiment ? I believe that 
you have been freed now for the 
same reason you were freed once 
before; simply that you might lead 
him farther along the path that 
leads to me." 



I'll give him credit; he recognized 
its significance. But if he had consulted me, I would have told him 
it was no longer on Earth." 

"That's exactly it, sir. I am certain the Tyranni have it." 

"Certainly not. / have it. I've 
had it for twenty years. It was 
what started the 'Rebellion World,' 
for it was only when I had it that 
I knew we could hold our winnings 
once we had won." 

"It is a weapon, then." 

"It is the strongest weapon in 
the universe. It will destroy the 
Tyranni and us alike, but will save 
the Nebular Kingdoms. Without 
it, we could defeat the Tyranni perhaps, but we would only have exchanged one feudal despotism for 
another and, as the Tyranni are 
plotted against, we would be 
plotted against. We and they must 
both be delivered into the ashcan 
of outmoded political systems. The 
time for maturity has come as it 
once came on the planet Earth, and 
there will be a new kind of government, a kind that has never yet 
been tried in the Galaxy. There 
will be no Khans, nor Autarchs, 
Directors, nor Ranchers." 

"In the name of Space," roared 
Rizzett, "what will there be?" 

"People." 

"People? How can they govern? 
There must be some one person to 
make decisions." 

"There is a way. The blueprint 
I have dealt with a small section of 
one planet, but it can be adapted to 



BIRON was pale. "Then I must 
leave Rhodia?" 
"No. That would be fatal. There 
would seem no reason for you to 
leave, save the true one. Stay with 
me and they will remain uncertain. 
My plans are nearly completed. 
One more year, perhaps less." 

"But, Director, there are factors 
you may not be aware of. There is 
the matter of the document — " 
"For which your father was 
j searching?" 
ft "Yes." 

"Your father, my boy, did not 
jj know all there was to know. It is 
not safe to have anyone in possession of all the facts. The old 
Rancher discovered the existence of 
the document independently in the 
references to it in my old library.

all the Galaxy." The Director 
smiled. "Come, children, I may as 
well marry you. It can do little 
more harm now." 

Biron's hand tightly enclosed 
Artemisia's and she was smiling at 
him. They felt the queer, inward 
twinge as the Remorseless made 
its single pre-calculated Jump. 

Biron said, "Before you start, 
sir, will you tell me something 
about the blueprint you mention, 
so that my curiosity will be satisfied and I can keep my mind on 
Arta?" 

Artemisia laughed and said, 
"You had better do it, father. I 
couldn't bear an abstracted groom." 

Hinrik smiled. "I know the 



document by heart. Listen to me." 

And with Rhodia's sun bright on 
the visiplate, Hinrik began with 
those words that were older, far 
older, than the civilization of any 
of the planets in the Galaxy save 
one: 

" 'We, the people of the United 
States' — but substitute the United 
Galaxy — 'in order to form a more 
perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide 
for the common defense, promote 
the general welfare, and secure the 
blessings of liberty to ourselves and 
our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the 
United States of America

The Current 
 Novel... 

PRELUDE TO SPACE 

by 

Arthur C. Clarke 



Br Written by one of England's foremost scientistauthors, this is perhaps the most humanly convincing, 
scientifically valid account of how interplanetary flight 
will be achieved that has ever been published. 

Mr You'll find here no wicked wenches seducing 
secrets from innocent engineers ... no enemy sabotage 
attempts ... no gadgeteers putting together items from 
the corner hardware store to be the first to conquer 
space... or any of the other machine-made devices of 
juvenile science fiction. 

Br It's real because it uses no phony melodrama to 
heighten the enormous drama of the concerted effort 
to win humanity's greatest victory. If you don't live this 
book, you're just not living. 

Mr And... it has never been published before in any 
form! An ORIGINAL complete book-length novel and 
the price remains . . .
