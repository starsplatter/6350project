Socrates By JOHN CHRISTOPHER 



I HAD closed the lab for the Jennings, the caretaker, was 
afternoon and was walking holding a young puppy in his hand 
down toward the front gate, and beating its head against the 
meaning to take a bus into town, stone wall. At his feet were three 
when I heard the squeals from the dead puppies, and as I came 
direction of the caretaker's cottage, through the gate he tossed a fourth 
I'm fond of animals and hate to among them, and picked up the last 
hear them in pain, so I walked squirming remnant of the litter. I 
through the gate into the cottage called out sharply: 
yard. What I saw horrified me. "Jennings! What's going on?" 
He turned to face me, sti/l holding the puppy in his hand. He is a 
surly-looking fellow at best, but 
now he looked thunderous. 

"What the hell do you think I'm 
doing?" he demanded. "Killing off 
a useless litter — that's what I'm doing." 

He held the pup out for me to 
observe. 



"Here," he went on, "have a look 
at this and you'll see why." 

I looked closely. It was the queerest pup I had ever seen. It had a 
dirty, tan coat and abnormally thick 
legs. But it was the head that drew 
attention. It must have been fully 
four times the size of any ordinarypup of its breed; so big thr.t, although its neck was sturdy, the 



SOCRATES 



85 



head seemed to dangle on it like an 
apple on a stalk.
"It's a queer one, all right," I 
admitted. 

"Queer?"' he exclaimed. "It's a 
monster, that's what it is." He 
looked at me angrily. "And I know 
the cause of it. I'm not a fool. There 
was a bit in the Sunday papers a 
couple of weeks back about it. It's 
them electrical X-ray machines you 
have up at the House. It said in the 
paper about X-rays being able to 
influence what's to be born and 
make monsters of them. And look 
at this for a litter of pedigree airedales ; not one that would make 
even a respectable mongrel. Thirty 
quid the price of this litter at the 
very least." 

"It's a pity," I said, "but I'm 
pretty sure the company won't accept responsibility. You must have 
let your bitch run loose beyond the 
inner gate and there's no excuse for 
that It's too bad you didn't see that 
bit in the Sunday paper a few 
weeks earlier; you might have kept 
her chained up more. You know 
you've been warned about going 
near the plant." 

"Yes," he snarled, "I know what 
chance I've got of getting money 
out of those crooks. But at least I 
can get some pleasure out of braining this lot." 

He prepared to swing the pup 
against the wall. It had been quiet 
while we were talking, but now it 
gave one low howl and open ed 
large eyes in a way that seemed 



fantastically to suggest that it had 
been listening to our conversation, 
and knew its fate was sealed. I 
grabbed hold of Jennings' arm 
pretty roughly. 

"Hold on," I said. "When did 
you say those pups were born?" 

"This morning," he growled. 

I said, "But its eyes are open. 
And look at the color! Have you 
ever seen an airedale with blue eyes 
before?" 

He laughed unpleasantly. "Has 
anybody ever seen an airedale with 
a head like that before, or a coat 
like that? It's no more an airedale 
than I am. It's a cur. And I know 
how to deal with it." 

THE pup was whining to itself, 
as though realizing the futility of making louder noises. I 
pulled my wallet out. 

"I'll give you a quid for it," I 
said. 

He whistled. "You must be 
mad," he said. "But why should 
that worry me? It's yours for the 
money. Taking it now?" 

"I can't," I said. "My landlady 
wouldn't let me. But I'll pay you 
ten bob a week if you will look 
after it till I can find it a place. Is 
it a deal?" 

He put his hand out again. "In 
advance?" 

I paid him. 

"I'll look after it, guv'nor, even 
though it goes against the grain. At 
any rate it'll give Glory something 
to mother." 



86 




 



AT LEAST once a day, sometimes twice, I used to call in 
to see how the pup was getting 
along. It was progressing amazingly. At the end of the second week 
Jennings asked for an increase of 
2/6d. in the charge for keeping it, 
and I had to agree. It had fed from 
the mother for less than a week, 
after which it had begun to eat its 
own food, and with a tremendous 
appetite. 

Jennings scratched his unkempt 
head when he looked at it. "I don't 
know. I've never seen a dog like it. 
Glory didn't give it no lessons in 
eating or drinking. It just watched 
her from the corner and one day, 
when I brought fresh stuff down, 
it set on it like a wolf. It ain't natural." 

Watching the pup eat, I was 
amazed myself. It seemed to have 
more capacity for food than its 
mother, and you could almost see 
it putting on weight and size. And 
its cleverness! It was hardly more 
than a fortnight old when I surprised it carefully pawing the latch 
of the kennel door open, to get at 
some food that Jennings had left 
outside while going out to open the 
gates. But even at that stage I don't 
think it was such superficial tricks 
that impressed me, so much as the 
way I would catch it watching 
Jennings and me as we leaned over 
the kennel fence discussing it. 
There was such an air of attentiveness about the way it sat, with one 
ear cocked, a puzzled frown on that 



broad-browed, most uncanine face. 

Jennings said one day, "Thought 
of a name for him yet?" 

"Yes," I said. "I'm going to call 
him Socrates." 

"Socrates?" repeated Jennings. 
"Something to do with football?" 

I smiled. "There was another 
great thinker with that name several thousand years ago. A Greek." 

"Oh," Jennings said scornfully, 
"a Greek . . .'* 

One Friday evening I brought a 
friend down to see Socrates — a man 
who had made a study of dogs. 
Jennings wasn't in. This didn't surprise me because he habitually got 
drunk at least one evening a week 
and Friday was his favorite. I took 
my friend around to the kennels. 

He didn't say anything when he 
saw the pup, which was now, after 
three weeks, the size of a large foxterrier. He examined it carefully, 
as though he were judging a prize 
winner at Cruft's. Then he put it 
down and turned to me. 

"How old did you say this dog 
is?" he asked. 

I told him. 

He shook his head. "If it were 
anyone but you who told me, I 
would call him a liar," he said. 
"Man, I've never seen anything 
like it. And that head . . . You say 
the rest of the litter were the 
same?" 

"The bodies looked identical," I 
told him. "That's what impressed 
me. You are liable to get queer 
freak mutations round these new 



SOCRATES 



27 



labs of ours — double-headed rats 
and that sort of thing — but five the 
same in one litter ! That looked 
like a true mutation to me." 

He said, "Mutations I'm a bit 
shaky about, but five alike in one 
litter look like a true breed to me. 
What a tragedy that fool killed 
them." 

"He killed a goose that might 
have laid him some very golden 
eggs," I said. "Quite apart from 
the scientific importance of it — I 
should imagine a biologist would 
go crazy at the thought — a new 
mutated breed like this would have 
been worth a packet. Even this one 
dog might have all sorts of possibilities. Look!" 

Socrates had pushed an old tin 
against the wall of the kennel and 
was using it in an attempt to scale 
the fence barring the way to the 
outer world. His paws scrabbled in 
vain a few inches from the top. 

"Good God!" my friend said. "If 
it can do that after a month . . ." 

WE TURNED and left the 
kennels. As we came out I 
collided with Jennings. He reeled 
drunkenly past us. 

"Come to feed little Shocratesh," 
he said thickly. 

I held his shoulder. "That's all 
right," I said. "We've seen to 
them." 

When I dropped in the following day, I was surprised to see a 
huge, roughly painted sign hanging 
over the kennel door. It read : 



PRIVATE. NO ADMITTANCE. 

I tried the door, but it was 
locked. I looked around. Jennings 
was watching me. 

"Hello, Professor," he said. 
"Can't you read?" 

I said, "Jennings, I've come for 
the pup. My friend is going to look 
after him at his" kennels." 

Jennings grinned. "Sorry," he 
said, "the dog's not for sale." 

"What do you mean?" I exclaimed. "I bought him four weeks 
ago. And I've been paying you for 
his keep." 

"You got any writing that says 
that, Professor?" he asked. "You 
got a bill of sale?" 

"Don't be ridiculous, Jennings," 
I said. "Open the door up." 

"You even got any witnesses?" 
he asked. He came over to me confidentially. 

"Look," he said, "you're a fair 
man. I heard you telling your 
friend last night that dog's a gold 
mine. You know I own him by 
rights. Here, I'm a fair man myself. Here's three pounds rive; the 
money I've had from you in the 
last four weeks. You know he's my 
gold mine by rights. You wouldn't 
try to do a man like me. You know 
I paid live cjuid stud fee for that 
litter." 

"It was a bargain," I said. "You 
were going to throw the pup at the 
wall— don't forget that. You 
wouldn't even know the dog was 
anything out of the ordinary now, 



88 




 



except for listening to a private conversation last night." I found my 
wallet "Here's ten pounds. That 
will make good the stud fee and a 
little extra profit for yourself into 
the bargain." 

He shook his head. "I'm not 
selling, Professor. And I know my 
rights in the law. You've got no 
proof; I've got possession." 

I said, "You idiot! What can 
you do with him? He will have to 
be examined by scientists, tested, 
trained. You don't know anything 
about it." 

Jennings spat on the ground. 
"Scientists!" he exclaimed. "No, 
I'm not taking him to no scientists. 
I've got a bit of money saved up. 
I'm off away from here tomorrow. 
VU do the training. And you watch 
the theaters for the big bill boards 
in a few months' time — George 
Jennings and his Wonder Dog, 
Socrates ! I'll be up at the West End 
inside a year." 

IT WAS only three months later 
that I saw the name on the bills 
outside the Empire Theater in Barcaster. There had been no word 
from Jennings during that time. 
As he had said he would, he had 
gone with the dog, vanishing completely. Now he was back, and the 
bill read as he had told me it 
would: 

GEORGE JENNINGS 
AND HIS WONDER DOG, 
SOCRATES 



I went in and bought a seat in 
the front row. There were some 
knockabout comedians fooling together on the stage; and after them 
a team of rather tired-looking acrobats. Jennings was the third in appearance. He strode on to a fanfare 
of trumpets, and behind him loped 
Socrates. 

He was bigger and his rough, tan 
coat was shaggier than ever. His 
head was more in proportion to his 
body, too, but it was still huge. He 
looked nearer to a St. Bernard than 
any breed I could think of, but he 
was very little like a St. Bernard. 
He was just Socrates, with the same 
blue eyes blazing that had surprised 
me that afternoon four months before. 

Jennings had taught him tricks, 
all right. As they reached the center 
of the stage, Socrates staggered up 
on to his hind legs, waddled to the 
footlights and saluted the audience. 
He swung effortlessly from the 
trapezes the acrobats had left, 
spelled out words in reply to 
Jennings' questions, pulling alphabet blocks forward with his teeth. 
He went through all the repertoire 
that trick dogs usually follow, capping them with an assurance that 
made the audience watch in respectful silence. But when he left, walking stiffly off the stage, the ovation 
was tremendous. They came back 
half a dozen times for encores, 
Socrates saluting gravely each time 
the mob of hysterical humans before him. When they had left for 



SOCRATES 



the last time, I walked out, too. 

I bribed the doorman to let me 
know the name of Jennings' hotel. 
He wasn't staying with the rest of 
the music-hall people but by himself in the Grand. I walked over 
there late in the evening, and had 
my name sent up. The small, 
grubby page boy came back in a few 
minutes. 

"Mr. Jennings says you're to go 
right up," he told me, and added 
the floor and room number. 

T KNOCKED and heard JenJ- nings' voice answer, "Come in !" 

He seemed more prosperous than 
the Jennings I had known, but 
there was the same shifty look about 
him. He was sitting in front of the 
fire wearing an expensive blue-andgold dressing gown, and as I entered the room he poured himself 
whisky from a decanter. I noticed 
that his hand shook slightly. 

"Why," he said thickly, "if it 
isn't the professor! Always a 
pleasure to see old friends. Have a 
drink, Professor." 

He helped me to whisky. 

"Here's to you. Professor," he 
said, "and to Socrates, the Wonder 
Dog!" 

I said, "Can I see him?" 

He grinned. "Any time you like. 
Socrates !" 

A door pushed open and Socrates 
walked in, magnificent in his bearing and in the broad, intelligent 
face from which those blue eyes 
looked out. He advanced to Jen


nings' chair and dropped into 
immobility, head couched between 
powerful paws. 

"You seen our show?" Jennings 
asked. 

I nodded. 

"Great, isn't it? But it's only the 
beginning. We're going to show 
them! Socrates, do the new trick." 

Socrates jumped up and left the 
room, returning a moment later 
pulling a small wooden go-cart, 
gripping a rope attached to it in 
his teeth. I noticed that the cart had 
a primitive pedal arrangement near 
the front, fixed to the front wheels. 
Socrates suddenly leaped into the 
cart, and, moving the pedals with 
his paws, propelled himself along 
the room. As he reached the wall, 
the cart swerved and I noticed that 
his tail worked a rudderlike arrangement for steering. He went 
the reverse length of the room and 
turned again, but this time failed 
to allow enough clearance. The cart 
hit the side wall and Socrates 
toppled off. 

Jennings rose to his feet in an instant. He snatched a whip from the 
wall, and, while Socrates cowered, 
thrashed him viciously, cursing him 
all the time for his failure. 

I jumped forward and grappled 
with Jennings. At last I got the 
whip away from him and he fell 
back exhausted in the chair and 
reached for the whisky decanter. 

I said angrily, "You madman ! Is 
this how you train the dog?" 

He looked up at me over his 



90 




 



whisky glass. "Yes," he said, "this 
is my way of training him! A dog's 
got to learn respect for his master. He doesn't understand anything but the whip. Socrates!" 

He lifted his whip hand, and 
the dog cowered down. 

"I've trained him," he went on. 
"'He's going to be the finest performing dog in the world before 
I'm through." 

I said, "Look, Jennings, I'm not 
a rich man, but I've got friends 
who will advance me money. I'll 
get you a thousand pounds for 
Socrates." 

HE SNEERED. "So you want to 
cash in on the theaters, too?" 
"I promise that if you sell 
Socrates to me, he will never be 
used for profit by anyone." 

He laughed. "A hell of a lot I 
care what would happen to him if 
I sold him. But I'm not selling; 
not for a penny under £20,000. 
Why, the dog's a gold mine." 

"You are determined about 
that?" I asked. 

He got up again. "I'll get you 
the advance bills for our next engagement," he said. "Top billing 
already! Hang on; they-'re only next 
door." 

He walked out unsteadily. I 
looked down to where Socrates lay, 
watching everything in the way 
that had fascinated me when he 
was a pup. I called to him softly: 

"Socrates." 

He pricked up his ears. I felt 



crazy, but I had to do it. I whispered to him: 

"Socrates, follow me back as 
soon as you can get away. Here, 
take the scent from my coat." 

I held my sleeve out to him, and 
he sniffed it. He wagged his huge, 
bushy tail slowly. Then Jennings 
was back with his billheads, and I 
made my excuses and left. 

I walked back — a matter of two 
or three miles. The more I 
thought, the more insane did it 
seem that the dog could have heeded and understood my message. It 
had been an irrational impulse. 

I had found new accommodation 
in the months since Jennings' disappearance; in a cottage with a 
friendly, old couple. I had brought 
Tess, my own golden retriever, 
from home, and they both adored 
her. She was sitting on the inside 
window ledge as I walked slowly 
up the garden path, and her barks 
brought old Mrs. Dobby to the 
door to let me in. Tess came bouncing to meet me and her silky paws 
were flung up toward my chest. I 
patted and stroked her into cjuietness and, after washing, settled 
down to a pleasant tea. 

Two or three hours later, the 
Dobbys having gone to bed, I was 
sitting reading by the fire when I 
heard a voice at the door. 

I called, "Who's there?" 

This time it was a little more 
distinct, though still garbled, as 
though by a person with a faulty 
palate. I heard, "Socrates." 



SOCRATES 



91 



I threw the door open quickly. 
Socrates stood there, eyes gleaming, 
tail alert. I looked beyond him into 
the shadows. 

"Who's brought you, old chap?" 
I asked. 

Socrates looked up. His powerful 
jaws opened. I could see teeth 
gleaming whitely. 

Socrates said, slurring the words, 
but intelligible, "Me. Can speak." 

I BROUGHT him in, shelving 
my incredulity. Sitting in the 
Dobbys' cosy room in front of a 
glowing fire, it seemed more fantastic than ever. Half to myself, I 
said, "I can't believe it." 

Socrates had sat down on the 
rug. "True, though," he said. 
I asked, "Does Jennings know?" 
Socrates replied, "No. Have told 
no one else. Would only make into 
tricks." 

"But Jennings knows you can 
hear and understand things?" 

"Yes. Could not hide. Jennings 
whips until I learn. Easier to learn 
at once." 

His voice, a kind of low, articulate growling, became more readily 
understandable as I listened to it. 
After a few minutes it did not 
seem at all strange that I was sitting by the lire talking to a halfgrown but large mongrel dog. He 
told me how he had practiced human speech by himself, forcing his 
throat to adapt itself to the complexities, succeeding through a 
long process of trial and error. 



I said, in amazement, "But, 
Socrates, you are barely four 
months old!" 

His brow wrinkled. "Yes. 
Strange. Everything goes so fast for 
me. Big . . . old . . ." 

"Maturity," I supplied. "Of 
course there have been 'talking 
dogs' before, but they were just 
stunts, no real intelligence. Do you 
realize what a phenomenon you are, 
Socrates?" 

The vast canine face seemed to 
smile. "How- not realize?" he 
asked. "All other dogs — such fools. 
Why that, Professor?" 

I told him of his birth. He 
seemed to grasp the idea of X-ray 
mutation very easily. I suppose one 
can always swallow the facts of 
one's own existence. He remembered very little of that first month 
of infancy. When I told him of the 
fate of the rest of his litter, he was 
saddened. 

"Perhaps best not to know that," 
he said. "Sad to think I might have 
had brothers and sisters like me. 
Not to be always a trick dog." 

"You don't need to be a trick 
dog, Socrates," I said. "Look, 
we'll go away. I've got friends who 
will help. You need never see 
Jennings again." 

Socrates said, "No. Not possible. 
Jennings the master. I must go 
back." 

"But he beats you! He may beat 
you for going out now." 

"He will," Socrates said. "But 
worth it to come see you." 



92 




 



"Look, Socrates," I said. "Jennings isn't your master. No free 
intelligence should be a slave to 
another. Your intelligence is much 
more advanced than Jennings'." 

The big head shook. "For men, 
all right. Dogs different." 

"But you aren't even Jennings' 
dog," I said. I told him the story 
of Jennings' trickery; how he had 
sold Socrates to me and then refused to acknowledge the sale. 
Socrates was not impressed. 

"Always Jennings' dog," he 
said. "Not remember anything else. 
Must go back. You not dog — not 
understand." 

I said half-heartedly, "We 
would have a fine time, Socrates. 
You could learn all sorts of things. 
And be free, completely free." 

But I knew it was no use. 
Socrates, as he said, was still a 
dog, even though an intelligent 
one, and the thousands of years of 
instinctive slavery to a human master had not been quenched by the 
light that brought intelligence and 
reasoning to his brain. 

He said, "Will come here to 
learn. Will get away often." 

"And be beaten by Jennings 
every time you go back?" 

Socrates shivered convulsively. 
"Yes," he said. "Worth it. Worth 
it to learn things. You teach?" 

"I'll teach you anything I can, 
Socrates," I promised. 

"Can mutate more dogs like 
me?" 

I hated to say it. "No, Socrates. 



You were a fluke, an accident. 
X-rays make monsters; once in a 
million, million times, perhaps, 
something like you happens." 

The bushy tail drooped disconsolately. The huge head rested a 
moment between his paws. Then he 
stood up, four-legged, an outcast. 

"Must go now. Will come again 
soon." 

I let him out and saw him lope 
away into the night. I turned back 
into the warm firelit room. I 
thought of Socrates, running back 
through the night to Jennings' whip 
and I knew what anger and despair 
were. 

SOCRATES came quite frequently after that. He would sit in 
front of me while I read to him 
from books. At first he wanted to 
be taught to read for himself, but 
the difficulty of turning pages with 
his clumsy paws discouraged him. 
I read to him from all the books he 
wanted. 

His appetite was voracious, but 
lay chiefly along non-technical 
lines; naturally enough, in view of 
the impossibility of his ever being 
able to do even the simplest manual 
experiments. Philosophy interested 
him, and I found my own education improving with Socrates' as he 
led me deeper and deeper into 
mazes of idealism, epistemology and 
sublincation. He enjoyed poetry, 
too, and composed a few rough 
poems, which had the merit of a 
strange non-human approach. But 



SOCRATES 



he would not let me write them 
down; now I can remember only a 
few isolated lines. 

His most intense interest was in 
an unexpected field. I mentioned 
casually one day some new development in psychical research, and his 
mind fastened on the subject immediately. He told me he could see 
all sorts of queer things which he 
knew humans could at the best sense 
only vaguely. He spent nearly an 
hour one evening describing to me 
the movements of a strange spiralshaped thing that, he said, was 
spinning around slowly in one corner of my room, now and then increasing and decreasing in size and 
making sudden jumps. I walked 
over to the place he indicated and 
put my hand through vacancy. 

"Can hear it, too,'* Socrates said. 
"High, sweet noise." 

"Some people have unusual 
senses and report similar things," I 
told him. 

He made me read through every 
book I could find on paranormal 
phenomena, in search of explanations of the oddities that surrounded him, but they annoyed him. 

"So many fools," he said wearily, 
when we put down one book that 
had painstakingly linked up poltergeists with angels. "They did not 
see. They only wanted to. They 
thought they did." 

The Dobbys were a little curious 
at my new habit of reading aloud 
in my room, and once I saw them 
glancing suspiciously at Socrates 



when lie changed his speech into a 
growl as they came into the house 
from the garden. But they accepted 
his strange appearances and disappearances quite easily, and always 
made a fuss of him when he happened to turn up during my absence. 

WE DID not always read. At 
times we would go out into 
the fields, and he and Tess would 
disappear in search of rabbits and 
birds and all the other things that 
fascinate dogs in the country. I 
would see them a field away, breasting the wind together. Socrates badly needed such outings. Jennings 
rarely took him out, and, as Socrates spent all the time he could 
filch from Jennings' training activities with me, he saw no other dogs 
and had no other exercise. Tess was 
very fond of him and sometimes 
whined when we shut her out from 
ray room, in order to read and talk 
undisturbed. I asked Socrates about 
her once. 

He said, "Imagine all dogs intelligent; all men fools. You the 
only intelligent man. You talk to 
dogs, but you not like pretty women, even though they are fools?" 

Then, for months, Socrates disappeared, and I learned that Jennings was touring the nojth of 
England, having a sensational success. I saw also the announcement 
that he was to return to Barcaster 
for a fortnight early in November. 
I waited patiently. On the morn



 



ing before he was due to open, 
Socrates returned. 

He was looking as fit as ever 
physically, but mentally the tour 
had been a strain for him. In 
philosophy he had always inclined 
to defeatism, but it had been defeat 
with a sense of glory. He had reveled in Stapledon's works, and 
drawn interesting comparisons between himself and Stapledon's wonder sheepdog. Now, however, there 
was a listlessncss about him that 
made his defeatism a drab and unhappy thing. He would not read 
philosophy, but lay silent while I 
read poetry to him. 

JENNINGS, I discovered, had 
steadily increased his bouts of 
drunkenness. Socrates told me that 
he had to carry the act by himself 
now; Jennings was generally too 
drunk to give even the most elementary instructions on the stage. 

And, of course, with the drunkenness came the whippings. There 
were nasty scars on the dog's back. 
I treated them as well as I could, 
but increasingly I hated and dreaded the time when he would say, 
"Must go now," and I would sec 
him lope off, tail low, to face 
Jennings' drunken fury. 

I remonstrated with him again, 
begging him to come away with me, 
but it was beyond reason. The centuries of slavery could not be eradicated. He afways went back to 
Jennings. 

Then he came one afternoon. It 



had been raining for' days, and he 
was wet through. He would not 
stay in front of the lire to dry. The 
rain was slackening a little. I took 
my raincoat, and, with Tess frisking 
beside us, we set out. We walked 
on in silence. Even Tess grew subdued. 

At last, Socrates said, "Can't go 
on for long. Whipped me again 
last night. Felt something burn my 
mind. Almost tore his throat out. 
I will do it soon and they will shoot 
me." 

"They won't shoot you," I said. 
"You come to me. You will be all 
right. Come now, Socrates. Surely 
you don't want to go on serving 
Jennings when you know you may 
have to kill him?" 

He shivered, and the raindrops 
ran off his shaggy back. 

"Talking no good," he said. "I 
must go back. And if he whips me 
too much, I must kill him. I will 
be shot. Best that way." 

We had reached the river. I 
paused on the bridge that spanned 
it a few inches above the swirling 
currents of the flood, and looked 
out. The river was high after the 
rain, running even more swiftly 
than it usually did. Less than a 
quarter of a mile away was the fall, 
where the water cascaded over the 
brink into a raging turmoil below. 
I was looking at it abstractedly 
when I heard Jennings' voice. 

He stood at the other end of the 
bridge. He was raging drunk. 

He called, "So there you are! 



SOCRATES 



■J5 



And that's what you've been up 
to — sneaking off to visit the professor. I thought I might catch you 
here." 

He advanced menacingly up the 
bridge. "What you need, my lad, 
is a taste of the whip." 

He was bran d i sh ing it as he 
walked. I waited until he had al


away, staggered, fell — and disappeared into the violently flowing 

river. 

I saw his face appear a few 
yards down. He screamed and went 
under again. I turned to Socrates. 

"It's all over," I said. "You are 
free. Come home, Socrates." 

The head appeared again, and 




most reached the place where Socrates was cowering on the boards, 
waiting for the blow, and then I 
charged him savagely. He fought 
for a moment, but I was sober and 
he was not. I caught one of his legs 
and twisted. He pulled viciously 



screamed more faintly. Socrates 
stirred. He called to Jennings for 
the first and last time: 
"Master!" 

Then he was over the bridge and 
swimming down frantically toward 
the drowning man. I called after 




 



him, but he took no notice. I 
thought of jumping in myself, but 
I knew I could not last even to 
reach him. With Tess at my heels, 
I raced round the bank to the place 
where the water roared over the 
fall. 

I saw them just as they reached 
the fall. Socrates had reached him, 
and was gripping the coat in his 
teeth. He tried to make for the 
bank, but there was no chance. 
They swept over the edge and into 
the fury below. I watched for their 
reappearance for some time, but 
they did not come up. 

They never came up. 

I think sometimes of the things 
Socrates might have done if he had 
been given the chance. If only for 
those queer things he saw that we 



cannot see, his contribution to 
knowledge would have been tremendous. And when I think that he 
was less than a year old when he 
died, the lost possibilities awe and 
sadden me. 

I cannot escape the conclusion 
that at his full maturity he would 
have outstripped all the specialists 
in the strange fields he might have 
chosen to work in. 

There is just one thing that worries me still. His was a true mutation; the identical litter showed 
that. But was it a dominant one? 
Could the strength and vigor of his 
intelligence rise above the ordinary 
traits of an ordinary dog? It's a 
point that means a great deal. 

Tess is going to have pups.
