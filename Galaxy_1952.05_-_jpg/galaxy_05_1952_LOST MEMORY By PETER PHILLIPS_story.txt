LOST MEMORY By PETER PHILLIPS 


I COLLAPSED joints and 
hung up to talk with 
Dak-whirr. He blinked his 
eyes in some discomfort. 

''What do you want, Palil?" 
he asked complainingly. 
l As if you didn't know." 
1 can't give you permission to 
examine it. The thing is being 
saved for inspection by the board. 
What guarantee do I have that 
you won't spoil it for them?" 

I thrust confidentially at one 
of his body-plates; u Yoii owe me 
a favor/* I said. "Remember?" 

"That was a long time in the 
past." 

"Only two thousand revolutions and a reassembly ago. If it 
wasn't for me, you'd be eroding 
in a pit. All I want is a quick 
look at its thinking part. I'll vrull 
the consciousness without laying 
a single pair of pliers on it." 

He went into a feedback twitch, 
an indication of the conflict be- 
tween his debt to me and his self- 
conceived duty. 

Finally he said, "Very well, 
but keep tuned to me. If I warn 
that a board member is coming, 
remove yourself quickly. Anyway 
how do you know it has con- 
sciousness? It may be mere primal 
metal." 

"In that form? Don't be foolish. 
It's obviously a manufacture. And 
I'm not conceited enough to be- 
lieve that we are the only form 
of intelligent manufacture in the 
Universe," 

"Tautologous phrasing, Palil " 
Dak-whirr said pedantically, 
"There could not conceivably be 
'unintelligent manufacture/ There 
can be no consciousness without 
manufacture, and no manufacture 
without intelligence. Therefore 
there can be no consciousness 
without intelligence. Now if you 
should wish to dispute — " 

I tuned off his frequency 
abruptly and hurried away. Dak- 
whirr is a fool and a bore. Every- 
one knows there's a fault in his 
logic circuit, but he refuses to 
have it traced down and repaired* 
Very unintelligent of him. 



HPHE thing had been taken into 
•*- one of the museum sheds by 
the carriers. I gazed at it in ad- 
miration for some moments. It 
was quite beautiful, having suf- 
fered only slight exterior damage, 
and it was obviously no mere 
conglomeration of sky metal. 

In fact, I immediately thought 
of it as "he" and endowed it 
with the attributes of self-know- 
ing, although, of course, his con- 
sciousness could not be function- 
ing or he would have attempted 
communication with us. 

I fervently hoped that the 
board, after his careful disassem- 
bly and study, could restore his 
awareness so that he could tell 
us himself which solar system he 
came from. 

Imagine it! He had achieved 
our dream of many thousands of 
revolutions — space flight — only to 
be fused, or worse, in his mo- 
ment of triumph. 

I felt a surge of sympathy for 
the lonely traveler as he lay 
there, still, silent, non-emitting. 
Anyway, I mused, even if we 
couldn't restore him to self- 
knowing, an analysis of his con- 
struction .might give us the secret 
of the power he had used to 
achieve the velocity to escape his 
planet's gravity. 

In shape and size he was not 
unlike Swen — or Swen Two, as 
he called himself after his con- 
version — who failed so disastrously to reach our satellite, us- 
ing chemical fuels. But where 
Sweii Two had placed his tubes, 
the stranger had a curious helical 
construction studded at irregular 
intervals with small crystals. 

He was thirty -five feet tall, a 
gracefully tapering cylinder. 
Standing at his head, I could find 
no sign of exterior vision cells, 
so I assumed he had some kind 
of vrulling sense. There seemed 
to be no exterior markings at all, 
except the long, shallow grooves 
dented in his skin by scraping to 
a stop along the hard surface of 
our planet. 

I am a reporter with warm cur- 
rent in my wires, not a cold- 
thinking scientist, so I hesitated 
before using my own vrulling 
sense. Even though the stranger 
was non-aware-^-perhaps perma- 
nently—I felt it would be a pre- 
sumption, an invasion of privacy. 
There was nothing else I could 
do, though, of course. 

I started to vrull, gently at 
first, then harder, until I was 
positively glowing with effort. It 
was incredible; his skin seemed 
absolutely impermeable. 

The sudden realization that 
metal could be so alien nearly 
fused something inside me, I 
found myself backing away in 
horror, my self-preservation -re- 
lay working overtime. 

Imagine watching one of the 
beautiful cone-rod -and -cylinder 



assemblies performing the Dance 
of the Seven Spanners, as he's 
conditioned to do, and then sud- 
denly refusing to do anything ex- 
cept stump around unattractively, 
or even becoming obstinately mo- 
tionless, unresponsive. That might 
give you an idea of how I felt 
in that dreadful moment. 

Then I remembered Dak* 
whirr's words — there could be no 
such thing as an "unintelligent 
manufacture." And a product so 
beautiful could surely not be evil. 
I overcame my repugnance and 
approached again. 

I halted as an open transmis<- 
sion came from someone near at 
hand. 

"Who gave that squeaking re- 
porter permission to snoop around 
here?" 

I had forgotten the museum 
board. Five of them were standing 
in the doorway of the shed, ra- 
diating anger. I recognized Chirik # 
the chairman, and addressed my- 
self to him. I explained that I'd 
interfered with nothing and 
pleaded for permission on behalf 
of my subscribers to watch their 
investigation of the stranger. 
After some argument, they al* 
lowed me to stay. 

I watched in silence and some 
amusement as one by one they 
tried to vrull the silent being from 
space. Each showed the same re* 
action as myself when they failed 
to penetrate the skin. 



Chirik, who is wheeled — and 
inordinately vain about his sus- 
pension system — flung himself 
back on his supports and pre- 
tended to be thinking. 

'Vetch Fiff -fiff," he said at last, 
"The creature may still be aware, 
but unable to communicate on 
our standard frequencies/* 

JPIFF-FIFF can detect any- 
*■ thing In any spectrum. For- 
tunately he was at work in the 
museum that day and soon ar- 
rived in answer to the call. He 
stood silently near the stranger 
for some moments, testing and 
adjusting himself, then slid Up 
the electromagnetic band, 
"He's emitting/ 1 he said. 
"Why can't we get him?" asked 
Chirik. 

"It's a curious signal on an un- 
usual band." 

"Well, what does he say?" 
"Sounds like utter nonsense to 
inc. Wait, I'll relay and convert 
it to standard." 

I made a direct recording naturally, like any good reporter. 
craziest stuff 



you ever heard, like goblins mut- 
tering, and I know we were the 
only ship in this sector. If you 
pick this up, but can't get a fix in 
time, give my love to the boys in 
the mess. Signing off for another 
couple of hours, but keeping this 
channel open and hoping . . . M 

"The fall must have deranged 
him," said Chirik, gazing at the 
stranger. "Can't he see us or hear 
us?" 

"He couldn't hear you properly 
before, but he can now, through 
me," Fiff-fiff pointed out. "Say 
something to him, Chirik." 

"Hello," said Chirik doubt- 
fully. "Er — welcome to our planet. 
We are sorry you were hurt by 
your fall. We offer you the hos- 
pitality of our assembly shops. 
You will feel better when you 
are repaired and repowered. If 
you will indicate how we can 
assist you — " 

"What the hell! What ship is 
that? Where are you?" 

-We're here," said Chirik. 
"Can't you see us or vrull us? 
Your vision circuit is impaired, 
perhaps? Or do you depend en- 
tirely on vrulling? We can't find 
your eyes and assumed cither 
that you protected them in some 
way during flight, or dispensed 
with vision cells altogether in 
your conversion." 

Chirik hesitated, continued 
apologetically: "But we cannot 
understand how you vrull, either. 



li 




 



While we thought that you were 
unaware, or even completely 
fused, we tried to vrull you. 
Your skin is quite impervious to 
us, however." 

The stranger said: "I don't 
know if youVe batty or I am* 
What distance are you from me?" 

Chink measured quickly. "One 

meter, two-point-five centimeters 
from my eyes to your nearest 
point. Within touching distance, 
in fact." Chirik tentatively put 
out his hand, "Can you not feel 
me, or has your contact sense 
also been affected?" 

It became obvious that the 
stranger had been pitifully de- 
ranged. I reproduce his words 
phonetically from my record, al- 
though some of them make little 
sense. Emphasis, punctuative 
pauses and spelling of unknown 
terms are mere guesswork, of 
course. 

He said: "For godsakemann 
stop talking nonsense, whoever 
you are. If you're outside, can't 
you see the airlock is jammed? 
Can't shift it myself. I'm badly 
hurt. Get me out of here, please." 

"Get you out of where?" Chirik 
looked around, puzzled. "We 
brought you into an open shed 
near our museum for a prelimi- 
nary examination. Now that we 
know you're intelligent, we shall 
immediately take you to our 
assembly shops for healing and 
recuperation. Rest assured that 



you'll have the best possible at- 
tention." 

rriHERE was a lengthy pause 
-^ before the stranger spoke 
again, and his words were slow 
and deliberate. His bewilderment 
is understandable, I believe, if we 
remember that he could not see, 

vrull or feel. 

He asked: "What manner of 
creature are you? Describe your- 
self." 

Chirik turned to us and made 

a significant gesture toward his 
tli inking part, indicating gently 
that the injured stranger had to 
be humored. 

"Certainly," he replied. "I am 
an unspecialized bipedal manu- 
facture of standard proportions, 
lately self-converted to wheeled 
traction, with a hydraulic sus- 
pension system of my own de- 
vising which I'm sure will interest 
you when we restore your sense 
circuits." 

There was an even longer si- 
lence, 

"You are robots," the stranger 
said at last. "Crise knows how 
you got here or why you speak 
Inglish, but you must try to un- 
derstand me. I am mann, I am 
a friend of your master, your 
maker. You must fetch him to me 

at once." 

"You are not well," said Chirik 
firmly. "Your speech is incoherent 
and without meaning. Your fall

ous feedbacks of a very serious 
nature. Please lower your voltage. 
We are taking you to our 
shops immediately. Reserve your 
strength to assist our specialists 
as best you can in diagnosing 
your troubles/' 

"Wait. You must understand.

out there listen.** 

"Out where?" asked Prrr-chuk, 
deputy chairman of the museum 

board. 

I shook my head sorrowfully. 
This was nonsense, but, like any 
good reporter, I kept my recorder 

running. 

The mad words flowed on. 
"You call me he. Why? You have 
no seks. You are knewter. You are 
it it it! I am he, he who made 
you, sprung from shee, born of 
wumman. What is wumman, who

HERE my recorder reproduces 
a most curious sound, as 
though the stranger were < i£ an 
ancient type of vibratoi molfcC- 
ular vocalizer in a gaseous me- 
dium to reproduce his words 
before transmission, and the in- 
sulation on his diaphragm had 

come adrift. 

It was a jerky, high pitched, 
strangely disturbing sound but 
in a moment the fault was cor- 
rected and the stranger resumed 
transmission. 

"Does blud mean anything to 

you?" 

"No," Chirik replied simply. 

"Or deth?" 

"No." . 

"Or war?" 

"Quite meaningless." 

"What is your origin? How did 
you come into being?" 

"There are several theories," 
Chirik said. "The most popular 
one — which is no more than a 



SO 



• AlAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



grossly unscientific legend, in my 
opinion — is that our manufac- 
turer fell from the skies, imbed- 
ded in a mass of primal metal on 
which He drew to erect the first 
assembly shop. How He came 
into being is l^jft to conjecture. 
My own theory, however — " 

"Does legend mention the shape 
of this primal metal?" 

"In vague terms, yes. It was 
cylindrical, of vast dimensions." 

"An interstellar vessel," said 
the stranger. 

"That is my view also," said 
Chirik complacently. "And — " 

"What was the supposed ap- 
pearance of your — manufac- 
turer?" 

"He is said to have been of 
magnificient proportions, based 
harmoniously on a cubical plan, 
static in Himself, but equipped 
with a vast array of senses.*' 

"An. automatic computer," said 
the stranger. 

He made more curious noises, 
less jerky and at a lower pitch 
than the previous sounds. 

He corrected the fault and went 
on: "God that's funny. A ship 
falls, menn are no more, and an 
automatic computer has pupps. 
Oh, yes, it fits in, A self- setting 
computer and navigator, operat- 
ing on verbal orders. It learns to 
listen for itself and know itself 
for what it is, and to absorb 
knowledge. It comes to hate menn 
— or at least their bad qualities 



— so it deliberately crashes the 
ship and pulps their puny bodies 
with a calculated nicety of shock. 
Then it propagates and does a 
dam fine job of selective erasure 
on whatever it gave its pupps to 
use for a memory. It passes on 
only the good it found in menn t 
and purges the memory of him 
completely. Even purges all of 
his vocabulary except scientific 
terminology. Oil is thicker than 
blud. So may they live without 
the burden of knowing that they 
are — ogod they ihust know, 
they must understand. You out- 
side, what happened to this man- 
ufacturer?" 

Chirik, despite his professed 
disbelief in the supernormal as- 
pects of the ancient story, auto- 
matically made a visual sign of 
sorrow. 

"Legend has it," he said, "that 
after completing His task, He 
fused himself beyond possibility 
of healing." 

A BRUPT, low-pitched noises

stranger. "Yes. He would. Just

Chirik looked around at us

again in bewilderment, but he 
replied courteously, giving the 
stranger a description of our 
world. 

"Of course," said the stranger. 
"Of course. Sterile rock and metal 
suitable only for you. But there 
must be some way. . " 

He was silent for a while. 

"Do you know what growth 
means?" he asked finally. "Do 
you have anything that grows?" 

"Certainly," Chirik said help- 
fully. "If we should suspend a 
crystal of some substance in a 
saturated solution of the same 
element or compound — ** 

"No, no," the stranger inter- 
rupted. "Have you nothing that 
grows of itself, that fruktiffies 
atM gives increase without your 
intervention?" 

"How could such a thing be?" 

"Criseallmytee I should have 
guessed. If you had one blade of 
gras, just one tiny blade of grow- 
ing gras, you could extrapolate 
from that to me. Green things, 
things that feed on the rich brest 
of erth, cells that divide and 
multiply, a cool grove of treez 
in a hot summer, with tiny warm- 
bludded burds preening their 
f ethers among the leeves; a feeld 
of spring weet with newbawn mise 
timidly threading the dangerous 
jungul of storks; a stream of 
living water where silver fish dart 
and pry and feed and procreate; a 
farm yard where things grunt and 



cluck and greet the new day with 
the stirring pulse of life, with a 
surge of blud. Blud — " 

For some inexplicable reason, 
although the strength of his 
carrier wave remained almost 
constant, the stranger's transmis- 
sion seemed to be growing fainter. 

"His circuits are failing," Chir- 
ik said. "Call the carriers. We 
must take him to an assembly 
shop immediately. I wish he 
would reserve his power." 

My presence with the museum 
board was accepted without ques- 
tion now. I hurried along with 
them as the stranger was carried 
to the nearest shop. 

I now noticed a circular mark- 
ing in that part of his skin on 
which he had been resting, and 
guessed that it was some kind 
of orifice through which he would 
have extended his planetary trac- 
tion mechanism if he had not 
been injured. 

He was gently placed on a 
disassembly cradle. The doctor in 
charge that day was Chur-chur, 
an old friend of mine. He had 
been listening to the two-way 
transmissions and was already 
acquainted with the case. 

CHUR-CHUR walked thought- 
fully around the stranger. 
*'We shall have to cut," he said. 
"It won't pain him, since his 
intra -molecular pressure and con- 
tact senses have failed. But since 
we can't vrull him, it'll be nec- 
essary for him to tell us where 
his main brain is housed or we 
might damage it." 

Fiff-fiff was still relaying, But 
no amount of power boost would 
make the stranger's voice any 
clearer. It was quite faint now, 
and there are places on my re- 
corder tape from which I cannot 
make even the roughest phonetic 
transliteration. 

u . . . strength going. Can't get 
into my zoot . . . done for if 
they bust through lock, done for 
if they don't . . . must tell them 
I need oxygen . . ." 

"He's in bad shape, desirous of 
extinction," I remarked to Chur- 
chur, who was adjusting his arc* 
cutter. "He wants to poison him- 
self with oxidation now." 

I shuddered at the thought of 
that vile, corrosive gas he had 
mentioned, which causes that al- 
most unmentionable condition we 
all fear — rust. 

Chirik spoke firmly through 
Fiff-fiff. "Where is your thinking 
part, stranger? Your central 
brain?" 

"In my head," the Stranger re- 
plied, "In my head ogod my 
head . . . eyes blurring every- 
thing going dim . , . luv to mairee 
. . . kids ... a carry me home to the 
lone prayree . . . get this bluddy 
airlock open then they'll see me 
die . . . but they'll see me . . , 
some kind of atmosphere with 
this gravity . . . see me die . 
extrapolate from body what I 
was . . . what they are damthem 
damthem damthem ... mann 
• . . master . . . i am your maker!" 

For a few seconds the voice rose 
strong and clear, then faded away 
again and dwindled into a com- 
bination of those two curious 
noises I mentioned earlier. For 
some reason that I cannot ex- 
plain, I found the combined sound 
very disturbing despite its faint- 
ness. It may be that it induced 
some kind of sympathetic oscil- 
lation. 

Then came words, largely in- 
coherent and punctuated by a 
kind of surge like the sonic vi- 
brations produced by variations 
of pressure in a leaking gas-filled 
vessel. 

" . . . done it . . . crawling into 
chamber, closing inner . . . must 
be mad . . . they'd find me any- 
way . . . but finished . . • want see 
them before I die . . . want see 
them see me , . . liv few seconds, 
watch them . . . get outer one 
open ..." 

Chur-chur had adjusted his arc 
to a broad, clean, blue-white 
glare, I trembled a little as he 
brought it near the edge of the 
circular marking in the stranger's 
skin. I could almost feel the dis- 
ruption of the intra-molecular 
sense currents in my own skin. 

"Don't be squeamish, Palil
Chur-chur said kindly. "He can't 
feel it now that his contact sense 
has gone. And you heard him say 
that his central brain is in his 
head." He brought the cutter 
firmly up to the skin. "I should 
have guessed that. He's the same 
shape as Swen Two, and Swen 
very logically concentrated his 
main thinking part as far away 
from his explosion chambers as 
possible." 



RIVULETS of metal ran down 
into a tray which a calm 
assistant had placed on the 
ground for that purpose. I averted 
my eyes quickly; I could never 
steel myself enough to be a sur- 
gical engineer or assembly tech- 
nician. 

But I had to locJk again, fasci- 
nated. The whole area circum- 
scribed by the marking was be- 
ginning to glow. 

Abruptly the stranger's voice 
returned, quite strongly, each 
word clipped, emphasized, high- 
pitched. 

11 Ar no no no . . . god my hands 
• . , they're burning through the 
lock and I can't get back I can't 
get away . . . stop it you feens 
stop it can't you hear . . . I'll 
be burned to deth I'm here in 
the airlock . . . the air's getting 
hot you're burning me alive . • . If 

Although the words made little 
sense, I could guess what had 
happened and I was fiorrified. 

"Stop, Chur-chur," I pleaded. 



"The heat has somehow brought 
back his skin currents, It's hurt- 
ing him." 

Chur-chur said reassuringly: 
"Sorry, Palil. It occasionally hap- 
pens during an operation — prob- 
ably a local thermo-electric ef- 
fect. But even if his contact senses 
have started working again and 
he can't switch them off, he won't 
have to bear this very long." 

Chirik shared my unease, how- 
ever. He put out his hand and 
awkardly patted the stranger's 
skin. 

"Easy there," he said. "Cut out 
your senses if you can. If you 
can't, well, the operation is nearly 
finished. Then we'll repower you f 
and you'll soon be fit and happy 
again, healed and fitted and re- 
assembled." 

I decided that I liked Chirik 
very much just then. He exhibited 
almost as much self- induced em- 
pathy as any reporter; he might 
even come to like my favorite 
blue stars, despite his cold sci- 
entific exactitude in most respects. 

My recorder tape shows, in its 
reproduction of certain sounds, 
how I was torn away from this 
strained reverie. 

During the one-and-a-half sec- 
onds since I had recorded the 
distinct vocables "burning me 
alive," the stranger's words had 
become quite blurred, running to- 
gether and rising even higher in 
pitch until they reached a sus- 
tamed note — around E-flat in the 
standard sonic scale. 

It was not like a voice at all. 

This high, whining noise was 
suddenly modulated by apparent 
words, but without changing its 
pitch. Transcribing what seem to 
be words is almost impossible, as 
you can see for yourself — this is 
the closest I can come phoneti- 
cally: 

"Eeee ahahmbeeeeing baked 
aliiive in an uvennn ahdeeerjeee- 
sussunmuuutherrr l" 

The note swooped higher and 
higher until it must have neared 
supersonic range, almost beyond 
either my direct or recorded 
hearing. 

Then it stopped as quickly as a 
contact break. 

And although the soft hiss of 
the stranger's carrier wave car- 
ried on without perceptible di- 
minution, indicating that some 
degree of awareness still existed, 
I experienced at that moment one 
of those quirks of Intuition given 
only to reporters: 

I felt that I would never greet 
the beautiful stranger from the 
sky in his full senses. 

I^HUR-CHUR was muttering 
^* to himself about the extreme 
toughness and thickness of the 
stranger's skin. He had to make 
four complete cutting revolutions 
before the circular mass of nearly 
white-hot metal could be pulled 



away by a magnetic grapple. 

A billow of smoke puffed out 
of the orifice. Despite my repug- 
nance, I thought of my duty as 
a reporter and forced myself to 
look over Chur-chur's shoulder. 

The fumes came from a soft, 
charred, curiously shaped mass 
of something which lay just inside 
the opening. 

"Undoubtedly a kind of insu- 
lating material/' Chur-chur ex- 
plained. 

He drew out the crumpled 
blackish heap and placed it care- 
fully on a tray. A small portion 
broke away, showing a red, viscid 
substance. 

"It looks complex/* Chur-chur 
said, "but I expect the stranger 
will be able to tell us how to 
reconstitute it or make a sub* 
stitute/' 

His assistant gently cleaned the 
Wound of the remainder of the 
material, which he placed with 
the rest; and Chur-chur resumed 
his inspection of the orifice. 

You can, if you want, read the 
technical accounts of Chur-chur's 
discovery of the stranger's double 
skin at the point where the cut 
was made; of the incredible com- 
plexity of his driving mechanism, 
involving principles which are 
still not understood to this day; 
of the museum's failure to an- 
alyze the exact nature and func- 
tion of the insulating material 
found in only that one portion 
of his body; and of the other 
scientific mysteries connected 
with him. 

But this is my personal, non- 
scientific account. I shall never 

forget hearing about the greatest 
mystery of all, for which not even 
the most tentative explanation 
has been advanced, nor the utter 
bewilderment with which Chur- 
chur announced his initial find- 
ings that day. 

He had hurriedly converted 
himself to a convenient size to 
permit actual entry into the 
stranger's body. 

When he emerged, he stood in 
silence for several minutes. Then, 
very slowly, he said: 

"I have examined the 'central 
brain' in the forepart of his 
body. It is no more than a simple 
auxiliary computer mechanism. 
It does not possess the slightest 
trace of consciousness. And there 
is no other conceivable center of 
intelligence in the remainder of 
his body." 

There is something I wish I 
could forget. I can't explain why 
it should upset me so much. But 
I always stop the tape before 
it reaches the point where the 
voice of the stranger rises in pitch, 
going higher and higher until it 
cuts out. 

There's a quality about that 
noise that makes me tremble and 
think of rust.
