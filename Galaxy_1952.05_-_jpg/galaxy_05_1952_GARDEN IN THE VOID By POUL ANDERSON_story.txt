GARDEN IN THE VOID By POUL ANDERSON 



AN asteroid. A green 
asteroid." 

His voice oddly res- onant in the metal stillness of the 
spaceship, he looked through the 
forward port with an uncertain 
wonder in him. 

There was darkness outside, the 
great hollow night of space, and 
a thousand stars flamed cold in 
the brass frame of the port. The 



asteroid showed as a tiny pale- 
green spark that only a trained 
eye would have seen among those 
•warming bitter-bright suns. The 
quality of it was different, a 
muted reflection of the Belt's 
weak light instead of naked fire 
leaping across a universe, and it 
flickered a little as the irregular 
stone spun on its axis. 

"Green." said Hardesty again. 
the note of puzzlement grown 
stronger. "I never saw that be- 
fore.' 

His wife shoved off from one 
wall of the cabin, her tall form 
weigh tlessly drifting past the glit- 
ter of control board to the in- 
struments mounted on the- farther 
side. 

"Shall we have a look?" she 
asked practically. 

Hardesty glanced at the meters 
and performed a mental calcula^ 
tion ; one had to be sparing of fuel 
on a voyage like this. 

"Yes, if the velocity isn't too 
different from ours.' he said. 

Marian's dark head bent over 
the telescope and her long, strong 
fingers spun a wheel, sighting o£ 
th? speck that flitted out among 
the constellations. There was *■ 
faint sighing of gears above the 
murmur of air blown through *■ 
ventilator. It was quiet out it* 
space — so quiet. Hardesty's pulse 
Was loud in his own ears. 

He undipped a pencil from ft 
pocket of his coverall and scrib- 
bled the figures she announced 
on a pad clamped to the control 
board. When her readings were 
done, he took the slide rule froin 
its rack and manipulated it with 
the easy speed of long practice 
His gaunt frame hung In mid-aif * 
one foot hooked through the and 
of a recoil chair to keep him ix 
place. 

The Gold Rash was moving 



outward from the Sun with a 
velocity known closely enough 
from his last astrogational read- 
ings. It was a fair approximation 
to assume that the asteroid's mo- 
tion was at forty-five degrees to 
the ship's path and its speed that 
to be expected of a body orbiting 
at this distance. Thus, from the 
observed transverse angular ve- 
locity, the separation could be 
estimated. It would take so much 
fuel to kill the ship's outward 
vector — a deceleration of two- 
point-five Gs should do it in the 
allowed distance — and then you 
added ten per cent for maneuver- 
ing and landing. 

"Uh-huh," he nodded. "It's all 
right, honey.** 

Marian swam into her chair, 
adjusted the webbing, and 
plugged in her throat mike. She'd 
be taking the reading while Har- 
desty piloted the ship, but you 
needed a comcircuit to talk and 
hear when the rockets were go- 
ing. 

His mind quit gnawing at the 
problem of a green asteroid and 
concentrated on the delicate job 
of working the ship in. Slowly, 
his whickering gyros swung the 
hull around. When the rockets 
started to roar, it was a thunder 
voice booming and crashing be- 
tween the vibrant walls, shivering 
the teeth in his skull, and weight 
dragged cruelly at a body grown 
used to free fall. For a moment 
his eyes hazed, the constellations 
danced insanely through a sud- 
denly reddened sky, and then his 
trained reflexes took over and he 
watched the asteroid swelling in 
the rearview telescreen. 

They shot past it at a distance 
of ten miles, splashing the great 
dark with livid flame. Now it 
rolled in the forward port, and 
he notched the main switch 
ahead and felt his tissues groan- 
ing. Marian snapped out a string 
of instrument readings, and gyros 
whined as Hardesty brought the 
ship about, changing course, bear- 
ing down on the rock. They swung 
past it in a long curve. When it 
was centered on the cross-hairs 
of the rearview screen and could 
be held there, Hardesty backed 
down upon it. 

A typical piece of space debris, 
he thought. It was roughly cylin- 
drical, perhaps ten miles long and 
five thick, but the crags and 
gashes that scarred its surfaces 
made it a jumble of blackened 
stone. Here and there a patch of 
quartz or mica caught the thin 
•unlight in a swiftly harsh blink. 
The greenness was in patches, 
clustered on such hills and slopes 
as offered most Sun, but there 
seemed to be a delicate webbing 
—of veins?— connecting all those 
bunches. There were brown and 
gray and yellow mixed in. Like 
lichen, he decided, and his mind 
hearkened back to the cool, mossy 



rocks of a New England forest 
and suddenly, almost bitterly, he 
wished he were there. 

The radar screen flickered and 
danced. Not much level ground, 
but he had landed on worse places 
without toppling his ship. Even 
if he did fail now, it would mean 
only the nuisance of rigging the 
derrick to lift her — a bump in 
that feeble gravity couldn't hurt 
vessel or crew. 

A motor sang above the dull 
thutter of rockets and the landing 
tripod slid out around the tubes. 
Electronic valves glowed, radar- 
controlled servos adjusting the 
lengths of the three legs to 
the sloping, pitted surface. In 

the sudden ringing stillness, as the 
rockets went dead, the hull 
boomed and sagged. Shale gave 
way beneath one leg, but the 
servo lengthened it till its foot 
rested on solidity, and then the 
whole ship was quiet. 

Hardesty shook his head to 
clear it and looked across at his 
wife. Her thinly strong features 
smiled back at him, congratu- 
lating him, but no words were 
needed ; they knew each other too 
well. He unbuckled the webbing 
and stood erect. 

THE vision of the sky was like 
a blow in the face when they 
stepped out. He could spend 
a hundred years in the- Belt, 
thought Hardesty, and its eerie 
unhuman magnificence would be 
as cold in his heart as the first 
day he left Earth. 

The Gold Rush was not a large 
spaceship — a two -passenger Belt- 
boat with extraction and refining 
equipment, fuel and supplies 
enough for a year of cruising — 
but she loomed over their heads, 
a squat metal tower against the 
stars, dully ashine in the pale, 
chill light. Before them, a harsh 
raggedness of knife-edged rock 
swept to ,a horizon that seemed 
near enough to touch, the edge of 
forever lying beyond that wolf- 
jawed rim of hills. The ground 
was black, pits and craters and 
twisted frozen magma, dully lit, 
sl^dows like holes of blindness 
creeping over the rough slope. A 
tiny Sun, three hundred million 
miles away, glittered and threw 
a wash of dim, heatless lumi- 
nance. 

It was quiet, the blank quiet 
of airlessness and emptiness, the 
only noise that of the muted 
scrunch of footsteps carried 
through the spacesuits, only that 
and the hot, rapid thud of heart 
and breath. The sound of his own 
life was almost deafening in Har- 
desty f s skull, and yet it was the 
dimmest flicker in a room of 
night, a tiny frantic fist beating 
on iron gates of silence. 

And overhead wheeled the 
stars, the million suns of space, 
fire and ice and the giant sprawl 



of constellations, the Milky Way 
a rush of curdled silver, the far, 
mysterious glow of nebulae, huge- 
ness and loneliness to break a 
human heart. There went the 
Great Bear, swinging light-years 
overhead, and it was not the 
friendly neighbor of Earth's 
heaven, but a god striding in 
flame and darkness, scorning the 
watchers, enormous and beautiful 
and cruel. The others followed, 
and the stars that Earth never 
sees threw their signals flashing 
and flashing across the years and 
the unthinkable distances, and 
no man knew what they were 
calling, 

Hardesty drew a deep breath 
and looked over to Marian. The 
declining Sun flared off her space 
armor; a sheen on the helmet 
veiled her face from him. The 
armor depersonalized her and the 
voice over the radio was a me- 
tallic rattle. It was as if a robot 
stood at his side. 

He threw off the oppression of 
solitude and forced a calm into 
his voice: "Come on, let's take a 
look at one of those green patches 
before sunset.* 

"I think there's one over that 
way," She pointed north with a 
gauntleted hand, 

Hardesty had already located 
the asteroid's pole star. He noted 
the position of the other constel- 
lations and set off after her. Ten 
years' experience had taught him 


how easy it was to get lost in 
much a jungle of stone, and their 
tanks only held air for a few 

hours. 

It was ghostly, bounding along 
in utter s^ence, almost weight- 
less, between the high, dead crags 
and under the sharp stars. In all 
his time out here, Hardesty had 
not lost the eeriness of it. And 
yet Earth was blurring in his 
memory, green fields and tall 
trees and the feel of an actual 
wind, a low old house among a 
thousand shouting autumn colors, 
beat of wings across heaven — he 
couldn't always conjure up the 
images. A blaze of naked stars 
would rise between. 

Well, maybe here, maybe some* 
where else, this trip or next, well 
make the big strike. Then well 
go home. 

It was the great chimera. For 
every man who reached it, a hun- 
dred broke their hearts or left 
their withered corpses on some 
unknown frozen rock. 

Hardesty had been one of the 
luckiest. He'd made enough once 
to buy his own ship, and since 
that time enough to pay his costs 
and even save a little money. And 
he'd met one of the Belt's few 
wo^n in an office on Ceres, and 
married her and made her his 
partner. ,- 

How would Marian look at 
Earth? She'd never seen it. She'd 
been born on Mars. 



The Sun sloped low as the as- 
teroid spun on its hurried, time- 
less way. Wan light glimmered 
off Marian's armor as she topped 
a high ridge, pinning her against 
darkness and the scornful stars. 
Her voice was a sudden excited 
gasp in his earphones: 

"Jim! Jim, come quick?" 

He bunched his muscles and 
reached her side in a soaring 
bound, floating down and twirling 
a little like a dead autumn leaf. 
{Autumn, a maple scarlet against 
October smoke, and a leaf scritf- 
tling across the sidewalk!) To- 
gether they looked down the 
ciazily tilted sheet of basalt to 
the seamed ledge jutting out 
against Orion. 

The green was there. In the 
airlessness, it was as sharp and 
clear as if it touched his helmet. 
Leathery domes, coiling vines, 
thick strong leaves — 

He breathed the word as if it 
were something holy: "Life." 

"Life? But it's not possible, 
Jim. No asteroid has life." 

His answer was flat, and a sud- 
den coldness tingled in his hands. 
"This one does." 

HE strode across the black 
slabs in the seven-league 
boots of Belt gravity. The Sun 
hung between two pinnacles, 
throwing a horned shadow across 
the acre of green. Hardesty knelt 
at the boundary of the patch- and 
grasped one of the cactuslike 
leaves. 

It seemed almost to shrink, and 
in the vague tricky light he 
thought that a pulse ran from it t 
through the webbing of vines, and 
out of sight along the filaments 
that reached from this ledge. He 
drew back his hand and squatted 
there, staring. Marian came up 
and stood against his side. 

"I — " Her voice was low now, 
trembling faintly. "I don't know 
whether to — to be glad or inter- 
ested or — frightened, Jim.* 

His long -jawed face slid into 
the expressionlessness of uncer- 
tainty. "I know. We've gotten so 
used to thinking of the Belt as 
inorganic that — well, our enemies 



have been cold and vacuum and 
distance, impersonal forces. We 
really don't know how to face « 
something that could be actively 
hostile. And yet, that life could 
exist and evolve here ]p a wonder- 
ful feeling. * He looked up to the 
stars as if throwing them a chal- 
lenge. 

"This can't hurt us. Plants. 
You don't think there could be 
—monsters here?** 

"I wouldn't mind a good hot- 
breathed dragon. But germs? I 
suppose I'm being an old woman. 
But you know what they say 
about bold spacemen never be- 
coming old spacemen. They don't 
live that long.** 

"How can any life exist here? 

No water, no air, nothing — * 
"I don't know. It's obviously 
not terrestrial-type life, though 
I'm pretty sure it's protoplasmic- 
It's adapted to these conditions, 
that's all," 

Decision brought him erect 
again. "I suppose we should try 
to study this out, make analyses 
and so on, but we have neither 
the training nor the equipment to 
do so. We'll take some pictures, 
and get an accurate orbit for this 
pebble, and report the whole mat- 
ter to Ceres. And we'll scout 
around for minerals as usual, 
avoiding these green patches. Our 
work is risky enough without tak- 
ing even a tiny extra chance.* 
"You're rigJi£." Marian stood 




looking at the plants. They were 
small and grotesquely ugly, but— 
"A garden," she whispered. "A 
little garden, blooming out here 
on the edge of nothing.* 

"Come on," said Hardesty. 
"Let's get back to the ship." 

rwiHE Sun sank under the farther 

-* rocks and night was abruptly 
on them. Their flashlights cast 
dull puddles of yellow haze on 
the ground, where elsewhere 
there was a sea of black under 
the streaming stars. The sky's 
light picked out the higher crags* 
etching them frost-gray against 
the dark, but the humans stum- 
bled in shadow, floating to the 
ground to continue their careful 
low-gravity shuffle back toward 

the ship. 

"I can't forget it." said Marian. 
"Those plants, blooming out here 
without air or heat or water — do 
you think that comets hover 
above them, Jim? Do you think 
their pollen is Stardust?" 

"Don't get poetic.' he grunted. 

In spite of their stellar obser- 
vations, they had trouble locat- 
ing the ship, approaching it 
finally from the other side. Thus 
they had walked around the mas- 
sive tripod before they saw the 
figure waiting in front of the 
gangway. 

3ardesty thought with a flash 
of disappointment that some 
Other prospector had beaten them 
to it. He had come far out of 
the usual lanes, without revealing 
his course to anyone, to avoid 
just that; matching velocities and 
landing was so expensive that, by 
law, the first man to set down on 
a new rock held all mining rights. 
Then, as he looked closer — 

The space armor was awkward 
and bulky, a model which had 
been obsolete long before Har- 
desty left Earth, and its metal 
was patched and battered. There 
was no air-tank. A thick-leafed 
vine coiled around the square old- 
fashioned helmet, across the 
shoulders and down the back, 
like ivy on an ancient university 
building, Hardesty saw with a 
jolting shock that a tendril ran 
into the helmet, sealed by a 
clutnsy weld, and that tiny root- 
lets veined the face inside and 
was tangled in among the man's 
beard. 

The — man? 

Marian's stifled scream was 
loud in his earphones; she 
clutched at Hardesty's arm and 
they skipped back together. A 
dead man, a corpse, a revenant 
puppet of plants which grew 
where no life could be — 

"Who are you? What are you?* 

The other took a floating stride 
toward them. His face was hooded 
in darkness; they could barely 
see the glitter of starlight in his 
sunken eyes- Hardesty stood 
.waiting, braced to meet the thing 



that neared him* The ship be- 
hind seemed infinitely remote. 

Metal hands clasped Har- 
desty's shoulders and the square 
helmet leaned forward to ring 
faintly against his own. That 
close, the miner could see the 
shaggy head inside, still veiled 
with shadow — a shattered grave- 
stone of a face with ivy creeping 
over it and reaching into the 
cracks. He fought down an im- 
pulse to retch. 

The voice that came was dim 
and slow: "You — from Earth?** 

"Yes and no. Who are you, 
man? What is that you're wear- 
ing?" Hardesty 's mouth was dry. 

"My name? It's — I am the 
gardener." The stranger shook his 
big head, and the cactus leaves 
on his helmet rustled where there 
was never a wind to stir thetiu 
"No, wait. Yes, they called me, 
my name, yes . . , Hans Gron- 
auer." A throbbing chuckle. "But 
that was long ago. Now I am the 
gardener." 

"You mean you were ship- 
wrecked?" 

"Yes. How long ago? There are 
not years here. I think it was 
twenty Earth years ago. That is 
a guess. It could be more." The 
newcomer brushed a gauntleted 
hand over his faceplate, a 
strangely human gesture, as if he 
were trying to rub his weary eyes. 
"You will excuse. It is long since 
I talked. And my — my talker?— 


Yes, radio. My radio was broken 
in the crash. I must talk this 
way.* 

"By helmet conduction? Yeah, 
sure. But — my God, man? That 
plant growing — growing on you 
like that—" 

The tiny gleam of teeth in the 
beard, the downcast eyes, it was a 
shy smile. "The plant gives air. 
So." 

"So — oft." Marian had heard 
the words over her husband's set. 
"Jim, of course, the plants re- 
lease oxygen and he's used them 
— Twenty years, Jim!" 

Turning his face, he saw the 
cold starlight gleam on her tear- 
streaked cheeks, and there was 
a sudden wrench of pity in his 
own heart. 

Twenty years! Twenty years 
alone in naked space! 

"Come into the ship," he said 
urgently. He .didn't think he could 
stand out here on twisted black 
stone with a million frozen suns 
jeering at him. "Come into the 
ship, man, and get some food. 
Twenty years! My God!" 

"No." Gronauer didn't shake 
his head, for that human gesture 
seemed forgotten, but he lowered 
his eyes. "No. Not yet, please.** 

"But—" 

"The garden would not like it. 
Not" yet." 

"The garden?" 

"World. We— don't dare. Not 
till we know. It has been so long. 



-1 think I see." It was Marian 
again; Hardesty had never 
stopped wondering at the cool 
quickness of her mind. She wasn't 
pretty f he supposed, but even on 
Earth he couldn't have had a 
better wife. "He's adapted in 
some odd way, or thinks he may 
have. He's not sure he can stand 
conditions inside our ship." 

"Yes. The plant might die." 
Gronauer's faded voice held a 
sudden eagerness. His vocabulary 
was coming back to him in a rush, 
"I must think this out. Come with 
me and let us investigate the 
problem." 

"Come where?" 

"My home. It is safe for you. 
But — yes, bring food." 

"You haven't eaten?" 

"The garden feeds me. But for 
you it may not be safe — be safe 
for you yet. Come quick. Pleased 

"All right, if it isn't far. 
We have to watch our air supply, 
you know," 

"The plants give air." 

At the thought of tendrils 
around his head and roots going 
into him, Hardesty shivered. 


"I mean air is in my house. 
You can breathe there. It is not 
far from here," 

"Very well." Hardesty disen- 
gaged himself from Gronauer and 
thus from auditory contact. 
Marian, fetch some canned 

jiff. And put my gun iNto a 


pocket. It's in the tool box. 

"Gun, Jim?" 

"Yeah." His voice was a little 
ragged. "Never thought I'd need 
it, but let's not take chances. I'm 
not leaving you alone with him, 
either. I'm pretty sure he's harm- 
less, but you can't tell. Twenty 
years! He's not acting like a nor- 
mal human being. But who the 
hell would after living here like 
that for so long? Yes, I want the 
gun." 

Wordlessly, she stepped up the 
gangway and disappeared into 
the airlock. Gronauer stood wait- 
ing, making no further attempt at 
conversation, and Hardesty wai 
tatisfied to keep it that way. 

The wonder of his discovery 
was lost in worried calculation. 
They could certainly not refuse 
to take Gronauer with them when 
they left, but his extra mass and 
the supplies he would need could 
upset the whole cruise. There 
wasn't any outpost to take hira 
to within some scores of mega- 
miles. So unless a decent lode of 
fissionable ores was found soon, 
he represented a heavy financial 
loss. Briefly, Hardesty wondered 
if he could leave Gronauer to be 
picked up by a government rescue 
ship. After all, scientists would 
want to investigate this place . . . 
But it'd make Hardesty an out- 
cast, being known to have aban- 
doned a shipwrecked spaceman. 
And he'd have to live with him- 



self. No, he'd have to take Gron- 
auer back, whatever it cost. 

All he could do was hope that 
there was a lode on this asteroid, 
Gronauer would know about that. 

Marian came back, loaded witli 
a sack of cans which Hardesty 
slung over one shoulder. Gron- 
auer set off at once. 

The path was dark, there un- 
der the ghostly arch of the Milky 
Way, but he picked his way with 
effortless speed. It didn't seem to 
occur to him that the others were 
having trouble keeping up, Har- 
desty cursed and stumbled. He 
noticed that there was * leathery 
bladder on the castaway's back, 
apparently part of the vine sys- 
tem. It glowed with the dimmest 
of red light Heat? 

After a mile or two of bare 
stone, they entered a patch of 
growth that seemed to stretch in- 
definitely far on every side. The 
frailer vines and leaves shrank 
aside from the human feet, and 
subliminally faint pulses rippled 
through the garden and over the 
edge of the little world, Hardesty 
estimated that they came, in all, 
some five miles from the Gold 
Rush before reaching the other 
spaceship. 

It was a smashed ruin. Only 
the central part of the hull seemed 
intact, and that had been patched 
and welded. It lay in a small box 
canyon, against the low bluff at 
the farther end. The metal rib
and the great broken tubes were 
scattered around it like raven- 
picked bones. And everywhere 
the steel was covered by green 
growth. 

Here the plants had become a 
thicket, vines swarming over the 
cliffs and wrapped about the 
gaunt crags, leaves and tendrils 
and looming fluted columns hid- 
ing the rock in a ghost-gray sea, 
stirring without wind and rustling 
without sound under the chill 
stars. Gronauer's cabin was 
smothered mn the dripping life. 
Hardesty could not suppress a 
shudder as the leaves framing the 
airlock brushed him. 

Within the chamber there was 
a stifling darkness until Gronauer 
opened the inner door, and then 
feeble light shone. It was lost 
again as frost condensed on the 
space-chilled helmets. Hardesty 
and Marian helped each other 
out of their armor, careful not to 
touch it with bare hands, and 
followed Gronauer into the room 
beyond. 

The miner's first glance was 
for the castaway, now that he had 
removed his ivy -covered, battered 
old armor. His hair and beard 
were streaked with gray, and he 
smelled unwashed, though there 
was no grime on him. It was the 
face that held Hardesty 's gaze, 
the cruelly smashed face which 
had healed into lumps of scar 
tissue. It was pockmarked 



cheeks and forehead, where he 
had gently pulled out the rooti 
of the plant that still clung to hii 
spacesuit. But the eyes were 
gentle, the mutilated lips curved 
in a timid smile, and he stood 
aside for his guests. 

The cabin was small, almost 
unfurnished, yet crowded. It was 
cold and the air had a musty 
reek. Plants covered walls and 
ceiling, made a springy carpeting 
underfoot, rustled and shivered 
as the humans walked across 
them. There were a lot of the 
red bladders twined into the 
leafage, and light came from 
countless tiny — berries? — things 
which glowed a dull amber in 
the gray-green tangle. 

"It is strange to you, I sup- 
pose," said Gronauer apologetic- 
ally. "But it keeps me alive.'* 

Hardesty touched a bladder. It 
was warm under his hand. Yes, 
the plants heated the room and 
aired it and illuminated it and 
fed the owner. He had a sudden 
dark wonder as to just who owned 
whom. 

"It's like a dream," whispered 
Marian. The unspoken thought 
ran on: A nightmare. A so.- 
realist's delirium. "Have you had 

this long, Mr. Gronauer?" 

"Yes. At first I ate the garden, 
but then I saw that, that way, 
one of us must kill the other, and 
if I killed it there would be no 
food for me. So I made friends 
instead, and bit by bit the gar- 
den learned my needs and gave 
them to me." 

As if exhausted by speech, Gro- 
nauer's rusty voice faded out and 
he answered no more questions. 
Hardesty repressed a revulsion. 
After all, this was a wonder- 
ful example of human ingen- 
uity, the greatest Robinson Cru- 
soe story in the universe, and 
certainly the plants were harm- 
less. But he took out cans and 
can opener with the eagerness of 
a man clutching at familiarity in 
a strange land. 

"Shall we eat?" he suggested. 

Gronauer shook his head, smil- 
ing, when they offered him Bio- 
nate and one of their few, 
cherished cans of beer. "I — have 
no taste for it," he said. "It might 
even be dangerous. I will feed.' 

Carefully, he broke off one of 
the fleshy cactuslike leaves and 
chewed on it. He held a trailing 
vine to his face, and Marian 
looked away as the tendrils 
stirred hungrily and slid into the 
pocks. At least, thought Hardesty 
a little sickly, the plants did 
everything for him. Everything 
except furnish human companion- 
ship — and it didn't seem as if 
Gronauer needed that any more. 

Not after twenty years. 

IT was surprising how much 
difference a full stomach made. 
Hardesty hadn't really been 



aware of his own hunger till it 
was gone and strength was flow- 
ing back into his bloodstream. He 
sat down almost casually on a 
vine-begrown chair — there was a 
mossy plant intertwined, making 
a faintly warm cushion — and be- 
gan to draw Gronauer out in talk. 
That wasn't easy; the castaway 
was too shy to do more than 
mumble answers while staring at 
his feet, but piece by piece the 
story was revealed. It was, in 
reality, quite simple. 

Gronauer had been only twenty 
or so when he left his native 
Germany for the Asteroid Belt™ 
That was thirty years ago, when 
the mineral riches of the flying 
mountains had just lately come 
to the attention of an Earth in- 
creasingly starved for fissionable 
ores, and the great companies 
were outfitting expeditions. A 
ship which cruised among the 
scattered worldlets, refining the 
substances it located, could re- 
turn in a year or two to one of 
the asteroid cities with a cargo 
worth a gootl many millions of 

dollars. 

Hard, dangerous, and profita- 
ble work has always commanded 
high wages, and no few of the 
prospectors, Gronauer among 
them, had soon been able to buy 
their own ships and go out as 
independent operators. 

He'd had a partner — he 
couldn't remember the -man's
name now — and they'd traveled 
and dug together for about five 
years. As the most accessible as- 
teroids became worked out, the 
custom of not revealing one's des- 
tination grew up. That way, if 
you found a rich group of plan- 
etoids, you could make several 
trips without competition — but, 
of course, if you met with an ac- 
cident there could be no rescue. 
Without more powerful radio 
equipment than a Beltboat could 
carry, there was no way to get 
help. 

Gronauer had gone north of the 
ecliptic plane, looking for one of 
the many groups which traveled 
in crazily tiltpd orbits. He'd 
found this green world and come 
wo^deringly in for a landing. But 
the asteroid had a satellite, a 
meteor which had suddenly 
flashed over the horizon and 
crashed through the ship's en- 
gines and sent it hurtling to its 
death. 

The other man was killed. 
Gronauer had escaped with brok- 
en bones and a smashed face. 
He*d lain near extinction for a 
timeless age; only the fact that 
the weak gravity made no de- 
mands on his body had saved 
him. After that, the only thing 
to do was to survive somehow 
and hope that another prospector 
would happen by. That could be 
within a year or never. It was 
safest to assume that he would 



leave his bones here. 

One man could live off the 
ship's food stores perhaps two 
years. But there was life, the 
plants, food. Gronauer had had 
no means of testing for poison ex- 
cept his own metabolism. A few 
times he got sick but he learned 
what he could safely eat. Certain 
of the fleshy cactus growths were 
nourishing. 

He harvested all of them within 
five miles or so of his ship. After 
a few days — or weeks, or months ; 
he lost track — he'd gone out after 
more, and found that everything 
was dead in the area which he 
had exploited. And when* he cut 
some plants elsewhere and ate 
♦them, he nearly died again. 

GRONAUER was no biologist, 
but a spaceman generally 
picked up a good knowledge of 
science and so he had heard of 
symbiosis. It was clear that the 
plants were in some way inter- 
dependent, that each species was 
necessary to the survival of the 
whole. And in some dim way they 
had sensed the enemy among 
them and reacted with deadly 
swiftness.. Any type he tried to eat 
would soon become poisonous to 
him. Perhaps the garden would 
try something still more devastat- 
ing. An unnoticed root, growing 
between two plates of the 
wrecked ship that housed him, 
could split it open and let out

the air in a great and fatal rush. 

With a quiet, methodical 
courage that Hardesty had to 
admire, he had given himself the 
urgent job of studying the sym- 
biosis. He had no formal educa- 
tion in biology and almost no 
scientific instruments; most of his 
conclusions were guesswork from 
the sketchiest data. But given a 
year or two of patient slogging, 
and a good mind driven by a 
peasant's deep, strong will to live, 
one could accomplish more than 
Earth's cold intellectuals would 
ever admit. 

He puzzled it out, observing 
and thinking in the huge loneli- 
ness of his world. The life here 
was protoplasmic, chemically 
similar to his own. It even seemed 
to involve photosynthesis of some 
kind. 

The tough skin of the "cac- 
toids" admitted ultraviolet light 
—intense in airless space, even 
this far from the Sun — while pre- 
venting the loss of water by 
evaporation. Instead, the water 
circulated through vine -systems to 
other species that used it in their 
own life -processes, and carried 
organic compounds manufactured 
by various types of plants to 
the symbiotic whole. The water 
was obtained from gypsum and 
other minerals by certain roots 
which added alcohol to prevent 
its freezing. Even so, the bitter 
temperatures would long ag» 



have turned it to ice, except that 
it circulated through the red 
bladders and these heated it with 
energy derived from fermentation 
or very slow combustion. The 
oxygen for that could also be 
cracked from mineral compounds 
beneath the surface. 

Cross- fertilization and the sub- 
sequent spread of life over the 
whole asteroid depended on spe- 
cialized vines. There even seemed 
to be hearts for this vascular sys- 
tem, slowly pulsing lumps of 
tissue scattered through the gar- 
den. A vast and unimaginably 
intricate network, each type ful- 
filling one of the many function* 
needed to maintain the whole in 
existence — 

A trained biologist might well 
have needed as much time as 
Gronauer to puzzle out the life 
cycle. 

"I still wonder if solar energy 
is enough to keep such a system 
going," said Hardesty. "It takes 
a lot to break up minerals, you 
know, even if the symbiosis man- 
ufactures catalysts. 5 * 

"We are as far from the Sum 
as we ever get," answered Gro- 
nauer patiently, "The orbit k 
very — yes, very eccentric. I think 
the period is about sevea years. 
At least we have three times 
come, I think, within the orbit 
of Venus while I was here. It gets 
hot then, special plants grow up 
to protect the others, and energy

is stored chemically against the 
long cold which follows." 

"I see. And with this highly 
tilted orbit, the asteroid hasn't 
been discovered even when it 
was that close to Earth.' 

The poor guy! Think of him 
Bitting here, watching the Sun 
grow and blaze, w&tching Earth 
swell to a blue brilliance and 
her moon visible beside her, and 
ttill alone, still forever alone. 

"How did life evolve here?" 
wondered Marian. "You need air 
and oceans for that, and this 
©steroid has been dead rock since 
the beginning of time." 

Hard e sty shrugged. "We'll 
probably never know, but I can 
make a guess. On some other 
world, maybe the world of an- 
othe? star, air and water disap- 
peared slowly enough for life to 
adapt. Certain spores of that life 
were lifted on the last wisps of 
atmosphere up to where light 
pressure could drive them from 
that solar system. The old Arrhe- 
nius theory. They survived the 
trip. There were a lot of spore- 
clumps landing on many worlds, 
but this might be the only one 
mi our system that had the con- 
ditions they needed for growth. 
Maybe not — the spores could 
be the ancestors of all life on our 
planets, but I doubt it Too com- 
pletely alien. * 

It was an eldritch thought, that 
the garden had been seeded from 



across that gulf of space, that it 
was the child of a world millions 
of years in its grave, and that— 
perhaps, in the remote future, 
when all the planets were airless 
husks, gardens like this would 
bloom as the last defiance of the 
sunless night. He shivered in the 
chill must of the room. 

"Go on," he said. "Tell us what 
you did.' 

Gronauer looked at him with 
gentle, frightened eyes. 

"Don't be shy," said Marian 
aoftly. "It is a great and won- 
derful thing you've done. You 
make me proud to be human." 

"Human?" The short laugh was 
jarring. A vague rustling went 
among the leaves. "I am — hu- 
man?" After a moment, looking 
away: "Please to excuse. I have 
not been used to talking so much. 
I will try." 

JXtHE words stumbled out, awk- 
-*- ward, toneless, the words of a 
man who had begun by speaking 
German, changed to the English 
of the spaceways, and then not 
spoken at all except for the 
shadowy half-language of the 
garden. Hardesty had to fill in 
gaps; the Castaway could only 
hint at a reality too far from hu- 
man experience for communica- 
tion — but the outline grew. 

It had been plain that the sym- 
biosis was highly adaptable. It 
probably had to be, to survive 



142 



• ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the extremes of the asteroid's 
wildly swooping orbit. Gronauer 
thought, too, that the impact of 
cosmic rays, unshielded by at- 
mosphere, induced a hugh muta- 
tion rate; somehow, the garden 
weeded out unfavorable muta- 
tions and took those it could use. 
The pattern was not a rigid thing. 
It was constantly evolving. 

There even seemed to be a 
primitive brain somewhere. Not 
a human-type brain — there prob- 
ably wasn't a nervous system as 
Earth knew it — but something 
had to control that change. Some- 
thing had altered the garden's 
metabolism and poisoned those 
leaves that the stranger ate. 

Probably it had tried various 
compounds from the beginning of 
Gronauer *s attacks, until it hit on 
this one. The man had harvested 
the deadly leaves and disposed 
of them with a terrible feeling of 
being watched. But that was ri- 
diculous — or was it? Was not the 
whole impossibly living world 
against him, ringing him in and 
waiting for him to die? 

After a few weeks he ate again, 
experimentally, and was not sick. 
He'd foolAi the garden. Only it 
would keep on trying to kill him, 
and he would never know when 
it had made a successful attempt 
until too late. His one long-range 
chance of survival lay in making 
peace with the garden; and that 
could only be done by proving his 



potential usefulness to it* 

Digging around a patch of 
growth, he discovered that cer- 
tain thick roots went deep into 
the hard rock. Those must be for 
extracting buried minerals. Pro- 
toplasm required carbon and oxy- 
gen, among other things, and 
most likely the source of the form- 
er element was the various car- 
bonates. 

Gronauer went to an area 
where the plants had not yet pen- 
etrated and began to dig. His 
miner's eye and brain were more 
effective than the chance grop- 
ings of the blind roots, and it was 
slow work for them, forcing their 
way into solid rock. 

Before long, he had a small 
heap of assorted carbonates. He 
macerated them and laid them 
beside one of the big roots. A few 
hours later, tendrils had grown 
around his offering and most of 
it was being absorbed. Limestone 
was a favorite, he saw, while iron 
compounds were hardly touched. 
He went after more limestone. 
And there were other elements 
they must need — sulfates would 
be especially valuable — and with 
the tiny atomic heater that re- 
mained to him, he could concen- 
trate nitrates. 

It took time for the garden to 
understand. There probably waa 
no conscious mind reasoning out 
what Gronauer wanted ; there was 
simply a high mutation rate and

143 



a completely integrated ecology. 
By supplying minerals, by loosen- 
ing rock about new roots, by 
guiding tendrils in their direction 
of growth, the man performed a 
service, and the energy saved the 
whole system could go into pro- 
liferation — some of which would 
be new, "experimental" forms. 

WITHIN a few months, there 
were pale leaves which 
seemed to be mostly protein. 
Gronauer harvested and ate them. 
Presently there were no more such 
leaves. They had apparently not 
fulfilled a real function, and the 
symbiosis had cut them off. Gro- 
nauer stopped working for the 
garden. He waited f and the slow 
weeks passed, and his supplies 
from Earth got horribly short. If 
he had guessed wrong — 

No. The flesh-leaves budded 
out again. Gronauer rewarded the 
garden with a heap of limestone 
and copperas. Thereafter the 
leaves stayed. Whether it was 
blind natural selection within the 
framework of symbiosis, or 
whether there really was some 
dim brain capable of learned re- 
flexes, the garden adapted to the 
new fact that flesh-leaves meant 
free minerals. 

"After that," said Gronauer 
simply, "we were friends. The 
problem was only to com — com- 
municate our needs to each 
other." 



He needed green food to pre- 
vent scurvy. An experimental 
taste made him ill, and again he 
withheld his services. Thereafter 
the garden produced more edible 
green leaves than it needed for it- 
self, and he gathered the surplus. 

It was to his advantage to have 
the garden change rapidly, so 
that new possibilities would arise* 
He rewarded each discovered mu- 
tation with an extra mineral ra- 
tion; if it turned out to be useful, 
he was lavish in his payments. 
Thus, over the years, he attained 
a remarkably balanced diet. 

Meanwhile, the plants had 
grown back around his ship, and 
he transplanted vines inside. They 
died, and he tried again, and still 
again, until he struck a variety 
that would endure the conditions 
he needed. They gave light and 
heat to replace his failing gener- 
ator, and proved to be much more 
efficient producers of free oxygen 
than the tanks of Martian sword- 
grass which was standard on 
spaceships. 

He had been recovering water 
by the usual condensing meth- 
ods, replacing losses by baking 
gypsum, but his nlw plants 
"learned" to give him as much 
alcohol -free water as he wanted. 
He could have had the alcohol, 
too, but he didn't like to drink 
alone. And surely few men had 
ever been as lonely as he. 

"And all the time," said Gro-

nauer, "I was trying other things, 
learning more about the symbi- 
osis. After a few years I got the 
— the feel of it. I have not the 
scientific words to describe, but 
I can understand in my own way 
what goes on. I can look at a 
patch of growth and tell what it 
needs. I can look at a mutant 
form and after a while know what 
it may do. By selecting new 
strains for several generations, I 
can create a species which will 
fit well into the symbiosis. It was 
thus I made the light-berries, for 
my own use, and roots which can 
use ferric carbonate — the symbi- 
osis could not handle that before, 
and limestone was getting short. 
And other things." 

"The — well, your spacesuit? 
The air plant on it?" Hardesty 
felt embarassed at mentioning 
that. 

"My air compressing pump was 
going to wear out soon, I knew 
that, and by then it was more 
natural for me to work with the 
plants rather than dead machin- 
ery. The plants growing on my 
helmet, they give heat and light 
and free the oxygen out of my 
own breath. They live from my 
bloodstream. It is not tftuch they 
need and they give me vitamins 
in return. Their rootlets entered 
my skin quite painlessly. 

"I have many kinds of food- 
plants now, with new tastes. You 
would like them, I think, but they 



are probably different from what 
you are used to. Go slow at first, 
eat only a little of the native 
food for a year, or however long 
your supplies last." 

Hardesty and Marian did not 
stop then to consider Gronauer** 
odd phrasing of the invitation. It 
wouldn't have meant much to 
them; in twenty years of solitude, 
anyone would develop a curious 
turn of speeth. 

Gronauer shuffled over to a 
desk, opened a drawer and took 
out an old logbook. Routine en- 
tries stopped with the shipwreck; 
what followed was page after 
page of fine script and painstak- 
ingly drawn illustrations. 

"Here are my notes.' he said 

with a humble pride. "I have de- 
scribed and pictured everything. 
It is all that you need to know." 

Marian skimmed through it, 
and her thin intense features lit 
with a genuine glow. 

"It's wonderful, Mr. Gronauer .* 
she said after a moment. "This 
marks some kind of epoch in bi- 
ology, you know. Your name will 
go down in history." 

"Urn, yes." Hardesty forced 
himself back to the practical side 
of things. "Tell me, though, how's 
this world for radioactives? Any 
good deposits?" 

"A few deposits, but not worth 
working unless they have changed 
refining machinery a lot since my 
time."

w They haven't.' The spaceman 
sighed. "Well, it was just a 
thought. We might as well blast 
off, then. Our ship's quarters are 
rather cramped, Gronauer, but 
well fix up the best we can for 
you.' 

"For me?" The soft eyes wid- 
ened. 

"Of course. Did you think we'd 
leave you behind?" 

Gronauer shook his gray-maned 
head. "But I cannot go. I have 
to stay here. I am the gardener, 
you see." 

TTARDESTY took a restless 
-***- turn about the cabin. His feet 
fell so lightly in the low gravity 
that it was soundless; he drifted 
ghftst-fashion between the clut- 
tered instruments and controls of 
the Beltboat.. 

"I don't know what to do," he 
said. "We can't take him along. 
Imagine having a raving lunatic 
crowded in here with us for 
months. But, damn it, we can't 
abandon him either." 

"We won't be abandoning him,** 
said Marian. "No one can say 
the situation is our fault. We'll 
let the government know, and 
he'll be all right till they send a 
ship for him.' 

"Even so, it's the principle of 
the thing." He stared out the 
port, at the hugeness of night and 
frosty stars beyond, barren rock 
and mute loneliness, and the pri- 



mal terror of it struck deep into 
him. "Leaving a man alone in 

thai'" 

"He's done all right for twenty 
years, dear. He can last one more. 
After that, it'll be up to the offi- 
cial rescue party. We can suggest 
that they take a psychiatrist 
along," 

"You had no luck persuading 
him?" 

"None at all. I tried every day. 
I went over to his place while 
you were exploring the asteroid 
and talked to him." Wistfulness 
tinged her voice. "I told him 
about mankind and about Earth 
and summer moons and smoky 
hills in autumn, the way we've 
always dreamed it — I've never 
seen Earth, Jim, except in pic- 
tures, but somehow it's more real 
to me than all this empty uni- 
verse. He isn't interested. I had 
to quit when he started getting 
angry," 

Hardesty went over and kissed 
her. "You're a good kid," he mur- 
mured, "Some day, some day 
soon, we're going home to Earth. 
No more space for us. It'll be 
roses growing over a house by the 
seaside.". His fists clenched im- 
potently. "If only there'd been a 
strike right here on this damned 
lump! But I hunted everywhere. 
Not a thing worth digging out. 
Gronauer told the truth." 

"Why should he have lied to 
us?" 






146 




 



"I don't know, except that he 
isn't normal any more. He doesn't 
react like a human being, even 
like a human who's been alone 
that long. Those plants have done 
•omething to him.* Decision har- 
dened Hardesty's lean face. 
"Well, he doesn't get many more 
chances to come along. We're not 
hanging around here another 
twenty -four hours. The sooner 
off, the sooner we'll find that lode 
and go home to Earth." 

"Yes, I suppose so." Marian 
turned back toward the micro- 
scopic galley. "He's coming over 
for dinner, you know. I talked 
him into that much, at least." 

"Well, I suppose there's no 
harm in it. Any special motive 

other than hospitality?" 

"Oh, we'll make it as bright and 
cheerful as we can. Homelike. It 
may change his mind." 

"I doubt that. But well have 
done our best," 

Hardesty glanced out the port 
again. The Sun was rising, a tiny 
brilliant disc winged with the zo- 
diacal light. Its thin radiance 
crept over blackened lava and 
tumbled granite, seeming only to 
add to the ruinous desolation. 

MARIAN busied herself, get- 
ting the small luxuries they 
had saved for festive occasions 
out of the freezer, filling the ship 
with an aroma that made her hus- 
band lick his lips and grin- She 



hummed as she worked, and 
somehow the table she set was 
like a bit of Earth — the gleam of 
plate and silver, a centerpiece 
of flame^red swordgrass blooms, 
even the tiny porcelain dachs- 
hund that was their mascot. 

"We're putting on the dog," she 
explained solemnly. "Now you go 
dress, Jim." 

He put on clean dungarees, 
knotted his one and atrocious tie, 
and slicked back his sandy hair. 
Marian had put on a print dress 
and dainty slippers ; she suddenly 
looked pathetically young. Har- 
desty wished with irritation that 
there was no guest coming, that 
this might be for the two of them 
alone. Briefly, he knew that 
they'd never really fit in on Earth, 
for something of the high, cold 
solitude had entered them and 
they were too self-sufficient and 
aloof. 

But that was a well-known psy- 
chological phenomenon. It was 
one reason why few prospectors 
went back till they'd made their 
pile and could live independently 
of society. Another was the diffi- 
culty, these days, of getting any 
kind of decent job on Earth. 

Ifs not mankind we're going 
back to. We 9 11 have neighbors, 
but our intimacy has become 
something that will never really 
let anyone else know us. It*s 
Earth we want, Earth and jelean 
winds and the tall trees abovm 9

Sun and sea and sky. We want 
an environment that is home in- 
stead of deadly foe. We want the 
heritage of our race's evolution. 

The stars wheeled overhead, 
grand and lonely — he'd niiss the 
sky of space now and then; he'd 
wonder at the dimness of con- 
stellations — but there'd be sum- 
mer around him, a whisper of 
leaves, the chirp of crickets and a 
firefly bobbing through the warm 
and sleepy dark. No more metal, 
no more tanked air and canned 
food and armored life — they 
would have come to their king- 
dom. 

Harsh sunlight gleamed off the 
figure that approached. Gronauer. 
Hardesty sighed, pumped out the 
airtock and opened its outer 
valve. When he closed that again 
and opened the inner one, a 
breath of searing cold eddied from 
the figure which stood there. 

Gronauer climbed out of his 
suit and looked timidly around 
him. He had dressed in an old 
coverall given him by Marian. 
It didn't fit well and he was ob- 
viously uncomfortable in it. For 
a moment, he shrank from his 
host's welcome. 

"It is — warm in here.' he 
mumbled. 

"Sorry. Want me to lower the 
thermostat?" 

"No, please not to bother, I 
will get used to it. You were good 
to ask me.' Gronauer edged ner- 



vously into the cabin. 

"Sit down. Dinner will be ready 
in a minute. " 

"I cannot stay too long.* The 
stooped gray form placed itself 
on the edge of a recoil chair, as 
if ready to leap from sudden 
menace, "In here I am cut off. 
The garden might need me and 
I would not know." 

"Isn't that the case in your 
own cabin?" 

"No, no. There are roots grow- 
ing through the plates. My chil- 
dren inside are part of the whole 
system. I have sealed around the 
roots so air does not get out, but 
the garden can still call me." The 
words were jerky, stammering a 

■ 

little, and the eyes were never 
still. 

"I noticed that every disturb- 
ance seemed to set up vibrations 
in the plants. Is that how they — 
communicate?" 

"Yes. Formerly, before I came, 
those were just special stimuli 
causing certain stereotyped re- 
actions. Like if a plant was hurt 
or killed by a rockfall, the vibra- 
tions triggered a reaction else- 
where, seeds were carried to the 
spot, a new plant was started. 
But after all these years, I can 
— read? understand? — more. Of- 
ten I know just what is wrong 
even before I go there. By sending 
my own pulses out, I can usually 
cause to be done whatever must 
be done, even without going

there to do the work myself.* 
"A sort of nervous system, 
then." Hardesty rubbed his chin. 
"And now you've become its 
brain." The thought was un- 
pleasant, somehow! 

Gronauer leaned forward ea- 
gerly. "And the eyes and hands* 
too. Many of the old functions 
have died out because I do it 
quicker and better, so the garden 
needs me. It would probably die 
without me. That is why I cannot 
go with you." 

"Soup's on," called Marian 
gaily. 

IT was mostly synthetics and 
dehydrates, but you wouldn't 
have known it, for she was an in- 
spired cook. Hardesty dug in 
eagerly. Gronauer, though, only 
picked unhappily at his share. 

"I hope you like it, Mr. Gro- 
nauer," said Marian, a little 

stiffly. 

His twisted face tried to smile 
an apology. "I am not used to 
such fare for a long time. Garden 
food tastes different. It feels dif- 
ferent," He waved a hand inar- 
ticulately. "How shall I make 
clear? It is that you eat things 
you have no kinship with; you 
kill them and devour them with- 
out any emotion. But . am nour- 
ished by something of which I 
am a part." 

Wryly, Hardesty's mind wan- 
dered off on the subject of au- 



tophagy. Given perfect surgical 
tools, shockless and bloodless am* 
putation, how long could a man 
survive by eating parts of him- 
self? 

"At first I wanted to go back." 
Gronauer's tongue seemed loos- 
ened all at once. Perhaps the beer 
he was not used to had taken 
hold already. "It is strange to 
remember how lonely I was — oh, 
for years I wept because there 
was no one and nothing else. But 
now I see that it is you who are 
lonely, each of you alone in a 
world of dead metal, shouting 
at someone else you cannot even 
be sure exists, cannot be sure 
what he is thinking of you or 
even if he is thinking at all." 

His grin was rather terrible. 
"How do you know you are not 
the only consciousness in a world 
of robots? Alone, alone, and you 
go to your grave and that is the 
end. But I belong. I feel the other 
life. It is part of me and I am part 
of it. My life has meaning and 
beauty — my life, married to other 
sensitive life, all of us together 
against the void. No, no, I can- 
not go back to Earth!" 

He lapsed into stillness, sat 
looking out of the port at the 
cruel brilliance of stars, and did 
not answer their remarks. Har- 
desty traded an exasperated look 
with Marian. 

"We're leaving, you know, ^Gro- 
nauer,** he said after they had

finished and were sitting in the 
recoil chairs again, "This is your 
last chance to come with us." 

The gray, scarred head shook 
violently, so that the long hair 
swirled about the eyes. 

"I suppose you'll make out all 
right.' said Hardesty. "Well plot 
an orbit that'll get us to the 
nearest radio station — I think 
that's Pallas right now — as soon 
as possible, and from there we 
can relay word to Ceres. It won't 
be many months before a gov- 
ernment ship comes for you. 1 

Gronauer shrank back and 
breath hissed between his teeth. 

"What then?" he gasped. 
"What will they do?" 

Despite himself, Hardesty was 
surprised at the violence of the 
reaction* 

"Why, you have a legal right 
to stay here if you want, of 
course." Unless the psychiatrists 
decide you're insane, his mind 
added grimly, "But there'll be 
scientists to study your garden 
and your discoveries. There'll be 
supplies and companionship — M 

"I do not want it! " Gronauer 
stood up, trembling. "I have all 
I want. I am the gardener. Is 
that not enough? Do not tell them 
I am here. They would come and 
hurt the garden." 

"Under the law, I can't aban- 
don you. It's all right to leave 
you, I guess, seeing thdtt that** 
what you want, but not reporting 



a shipwrecked spaceman? I could 
get in trouble for that." 

"Who would know?" inter- 
jected Marian. She threw a wink 
at her husband over Gronauer's 
shoulder. Soothe him, humor him 
till we* re away from here. "If you 
wish, of course we'll keep your 
secret. It's your right to stay here 
alone if you really want to," 

"I want. I want!" 

"But think, Mr. Gronauer." 

She smiled at him warmly. 
"Think of what that will mean. 
You're getting old. You can't live 
forever. You'll die here and per- 
haps no one will discover this 
asteroid for centuries, or perhaps 
never. The garden will die with- 
out a human to attend it. If you 
let the scientists come, they'd 
preserve it as a natural wonder 
even when you were gone." 

"They would not understand.* 
His voice was harsh and hostile. 
"The gardener must be part of 
the garden. He must grow into 
it, make it his life. Their scientific 
tending would not be enough," 

I think, said Hardesty's mind, 
that the old man is right* This is 
more than a mechanical set of 
duties to*be performed. You can't 
replace a human brain with an 
electronic computer, even the best 
and latest model, even one which 
actually thinks. You cant replace 
the gardener with a paid atten- 
dant. Even if anyone would con- 
sent to live here alone, two ot

three years at a time, for any 
wages. Could you be hired to let 
roots tap your bloodstream? 

"Then that's that," he said 
aloud, coldly- "The garden will 
last your lifetime, undisturbed." 

ORION wheeled mightily 
overhead, a glitter of frozen 
fire against an infinite clear dark. 
Gronauer sat still. There were 
trickles of sweat on his face, and 
he was breathing heavily. 

Marian tried to break the em- 
barrassed silence: "It has been a 
great privilege to know you, Mr. 
Gronauer. And the garden. Was 
there anybody you once knew? 
Any message, perhaps?" 

"No," he said abstractedly. "No 
one. Not any more." 

After another minute, his eyes 
lifted to theirs with a kind of 
entreaty. 

"I have thought of this be- 
fore.' he blurted. "I am, as you 
say, old. There should be a race 
of human gardeners here, to carry 
on. The garden is still growing, 
still evolving. It needs men, and 
it gives them rewards you cannot 
now imagine. Would — would you 
think of staying here yourselves, 
having children here, too?" 

The thought was so grotesque 
that Hardesty had to laugh, a 
harsh sound jarring against the 
drumhead of tense silence. It 
seemed to strike Marian differ- 
ently. 



"Children," she repeated, <- Yes t 
Jim, we have to get back to Earth 
soon, while we can still be young 
with our kids." 

"You could have them now," 
said Gronauer. "Here." 

"No. It isn't fair to a child to 
raise it anywhere but on Earth. 
It isn't right to grow up in metal." 
There was something haunted in 
her voice. "I know. It happened 
to me.*

"A child growing up here 
The castaway's words trailed off. 
He drew a long breath. "Would 
you come with me?" he asked. 
"There is something I would like 
to show you. It will change your 
outlook on all this. You will at 
least see why I want to stay here 
alone.* 

"What's that?" Despite him* 
self, Hardesty felt a resurgence 
of interest. 

Damn it, the asteroid was 
unique. 

"I cannot explain in words. 
You will have to see. It is not so 
far to go 

"Well— 

"It is the last gift I can give 
you." 

"Certainly well come," said 
Marian. "Well be glad to, won't 
we, Jim?" 

"Sure," he said worriedly. He 
went to the spacesuit locker and 
opened it. "We'd better hurry, 
then. It'll be sunset again pretty 
quick. 

"We will be following the Sun," 
said Gronauer. He lumbered over 
to his own suit where it stood in 
the airlock. Briefly, his gnarled 
hands stroked the gray-green 
vines that draped it — an odd* 
wistful caress. 

Hardesty peeled off shirt and 
pants, revealing the insulated 
one-piece undergarment which 
served as padding below his ar- 
mor. Marian exchanged her dress 
for a similar outfit. It looked well 
on her slim figure. Hardesty 
smiled as he helped her into her 
suit. 

Gronauer donned his own ar- 
mor. He was still breathing hard. 
Something very odd here. When 
he was looking away, Hardesty 
afhbled quietly over to the tool 
chest, palmed his gun, and clipped 
it onto his spacesuit. Marian saw 
the gesture, started to say some- 
thing, and throttled her words. 
Maybe he was right. There was 
at least no harm in it* 

Or in Gronauer. He might have 
been a little crazy by normal 
Earth standards, but what did 
those mean out here, three hun- 
dred million miles frpm the Sun? 
But he was not violent; he par- 
took of the serene, timeless 
strength of the garden, A couple 
of hours* jaunt was not too much 
to please an old man trapped in 
a loneliness he himself no longer 
recognized. 

THEY came out under a sky 
that was flashing ice and bitter 
dark, with a wan little sun low 
above ragged black stone. Gro- 
nauer led the way, a bounding 
figure of shadow and dazzling 
metal, now lost in a gully of 
night and now outlined gro- 
tesquely against the sprawl of 
stars. Hardesty swore at his 
speed, lengthened his own flat 
leaps, and felt rock and scree 
rattle beneath his boots. 

They were moving into the far 

bleak eye of the Sun, faster than 
the planetoid's axial spin. As the 
stars reeled insanely backward 
and the Sun began to climb again, 
Hardesty had a sudden weird 
feeling that he was moving back 
in time. He choked it down and 
concentrated on picking his way 
through the jumbled, looming, 
crazily tilted stones, down riven 
gulches and up hillsides that were 
heaped slabs of igneous rock, a 
nightmare landscape of ruin and 
murk. 

It was a zigzag path, he no- 
ticed dimly, leading into an area 
he had only skimmed through 
in his search, but he was too busy 
keeping up with Gronauer and 
Watching Marian to think more 
deeply about it. His breath was 
harsh and loud in a suddenly hot 
spacesuit. 

The Sun was halfway down to 
the ppposite horupp. when Gro- 
nauer went into another ravine 


and out of sight. Hardest y fol- 
lowed him, scrambled awkwardly 
down its steep sides, the undif- 
fused glow of his flash picking 
boulders out like distorted faces. 
The crack was long and deep; he 
had to fumble in shadow for sev- 
eral minutes before he came out 
at the other end* Then he looked 
around. 

He stood on a gigantic basalt 
block sloping off to the edge of 
the world, overhead and around 
him the stars and the rime-frost 
arch of the Milky Way, and he 
was alone. 

"Gronauer!" His voice echoed 
rattling in his helmet. * "Where the 
hell are you?" 

Useless, of course. Gronauer 
didn't have a suit radio. But how 
the devil could he have gotten 
lost? 

Marian came leaping out of the 
ravine and over to stand by him* 
Her breathing was as hard as his. 

"What became of the old 
man?" she asked anxiously 

"That's what I'd like to know. 
First he takes off like a bat out 
of Mars, and then he manages to 
lose us. Just went too fast? No, 
I was keeping up all right. He 
must have climbed the canyon 
wall ahead of me — I wouldn't 
have seen him — and taken off in 
some other direction.* 
'But why, Jim?" 
I don't know. He's mad, com- 
pletely cracked, of course. Needs 

psychiatry in the worst way. But 
let the government worry about 
him. I'm fed up." Hardesty took 
a long stride forward. "Come on, 
let's get back to the ship." 

"But he may just have made 
a mistake — " 

"Then he can catch up with us 
and lead us properly. The hell 
with him." 

14 Well, he does seem a pretty 
hopeless case at that, doesn't he? 
The poor old man! I hope we sec 
him again before we blast off." 

Hardesty shrugged. "Person* 
ally, I don't give a hang. Now 
let's see, which way is the Gold 
Rush?" 

"Why, I suppose — that way. 
Toward the Sun." 

"We zigzagged quite a bit, re- 
member." Hardesty's hand rang 
against his metal leg in a slap 
of exasperation. "Nuts! We're 
lost !" 

"There's the asteroid's pole 
star, up there, dear, and the Sun 
was west of it at setting, so our 
general direction should be that 
way." 

"Yeah. I hope it's not too gen- 
eral. Let's go." 

They set off along the sloping 
hillside toward a razor-backed 
spine of rock, black against the 
Milky Way. Neither one said 
anything. 

It was hard to orient yourself, 
if you didn't know every inch of 
the path. You had to twist and 
turn, picking a slow way across 
a narrow landscape of crags and 
gullies and craters, sometimes lost 
in darkness that was like a flow- 
ing liquid, sometimes blinded by 
the thin yet vicious sunlight di- 
rectly in your eyes. There were 
no broad outlooks. Vision was 
bounded on every hand. Only the 
turning sky had depth. 

Men had gotten lost on aster- 
oids and wandered within a few 
miles of their ships till their oxy- 
gen gave out. It was not a 
comforting reflection. Hardesty 
shoved it resolutely out of his 
mind, 

AFTER an hour or so, they 
passed a region of plant 
growth. Hardesty looked at the 
stretch of garden with a rising 
bitterness in him. 

Low, silvery shrubs, lichenous 
growth spotting naked rock with 
red and brown and yellow, high, 
gaunt, yuccalike boles and gal- 
lows branches, sullen blood- crim- 
son glow of heat bladders, huge, 
muscular roots plunging deep 
into the little world's iron heart, 
delicate faery tracing of vines 
looped and coiled between the 
shrubs, the throb and pulse of the 
garden's beating hearts — a reach 
of growth over the hills and out 
of sight, a frigid world made 
alive where no life should be f 
supreme triumph of organism 
over the chaotic waste of the 



frozen and hostile Universe — 

But it was too alien. Xhe 
eldritch forms only added to the 
strangeness and loneliness, and he 
h,ated them. He kicked viciously 
and saw the pulse of alarm ripple 
out through the garden and over 
the near horizon, leaves rustling 
and whispering in the windless 
vacuum of space, the garden 
talking to itself. 

"Go ahead," he muttered. "Call 
your brain. That's all he is now, 
your brain and your hands. 
You've taken his soul away.'* 

"Don't, Jim.' said Marian. 
"Please don't." 

"Oh, all right." He trudged in 
silence for a while before adding 
shamefacedly: "I'm being silly, 
I know. This is nothing but an* 
other instance of adaptation. Life 
on Earth is interdependent, too, 
a balance of nature. But I still 
don't like it." 

The Sun crossed the sky again 
and lowered behind them. Har- 
desty glanced worriedly at his 
wrist chrono. They'd been out for 
a good two hours; their tanks 
didn't hold very much more air. 

Don't get excited. That speeds 
up your metabolism, makes you 
burn oxygen all the faster, blunts 
the cool judgment you need. Take 
it easy. Slow and easy. Lots of 
time. 

Sunset, and darkness like a 
steel shutter slammed tight. 
Nothing around them looked fa- 

miliar yet. Rather, everything 
looked the same- All these lean- 
ing spires and tumbled boulders 
and gnarled old crater* looked 
alike and there was no way home. 

Marian's hand crept into his 
and he squeezed it, grateful for 
the touch of human nearness. 

"According to the stars, we're 
in the neighborhood noto," he said 
as unemotionally as possible* 



"We'd better follow a spiral 
path— H 

Out of the corner of an eye, 
he saw the blue -white sheet of 
flame that- spurted up over the 
horizon, saw it rising and spread- 
ing in a terrible brilliance that 
veiled the stars, and flung an arm 
across his eyes with a shout. The 
next moment the ground heaved 
acid buckled under him, flung him 
spinning upward in the light 
gravity and bounced him against 
a lurching granite cliff, then 
tossed him back to the shaking, 
sundering rock below. 

"Marian!" he cried. "Marian!" 
The fire was gone, but half the 
sky was blotted from sight by a 
column of smoke and dust, climb- 
ing and climbing like a monster 
spirit let out of Solomon's flask, 
and the ground shivered and rum- 
bled and boulders danced on its 
surface. Hardtsty clung to the 
rocks, clawing himself into naked 
stone, and his own screaming was 
loud and mad in his ears. 

"Jim! Are you all right, Jim?" 
They stumbled toward each 
other, falling and struggling as 
earthquake waves raced around 
and around the tiny world. They 
locked arms and lay on the crack- 
ing ground together and looked 
wildly at the nightmare scenery. 

fTiHE seasick roll died away. A 
■* miniature landslide came 
down a hill slope, slowly in the 
acceleration of feeble gravity, the 
slowness of fleeing through cling- 
ing mud. 

Hardesty and Marian got up 
and stumbled toward the black 
j.inni which rose against the £tars. 

He felt drained of emotion, a 
machine moving wearily toward 
some destined end. He topped a 
ridge arid ""looked" with blank eyes 
at the ruin of his gfife Tt *Wfts 
scattered to the horizon and be- 
yond, and the molten slag was 
still aglow beneath its resting 
place. 

"Gronauer," he said, just that 
one word, but it held loathing for 
the castaway and for himsllf, 
the time and anxiety he had 
wasted trying to help someone 
who didn't want to be helped, but 
mostly for his stupidity. 

Marian stared around. 
"Where?" 

"Gronauer? I don't know. He 
gave us the slip and came back, 
wrecked the safety controls and 
blew up the nuclear pile of the 

ship.

"No," she said. "He wouldn't. 
It must have been a meteor." 

Not where I landed. A meteor 
would have had to come straight 
down to hit the ship. Even then, 
it wouldn't blow up the pile.** 
He kicked savagely at a boulder, 
which flew off like a bird winging 
south. "Gronauer did it. You 
know that yourself." 

"Why?" Marian's whisper, like 
a dim voice from across that gulf 
of space that winked and jeered 
at him with a million hostile eyes, 
was so faint that even in hi* 
earphones he could scarcely hear 
it. "WTiy?" 

They saw the figure lurching 
up the slope toward them, hands 
dangling empty, the helmeted 
head overgrown with vines like 
an ancient Greek nature god. 



Hardesty drew his gun and rested 
it on his free elbow for steadiness. 

"Jim! No!" 

"Calm down," he said. "After 
what he did, I'm not taking any 

chances." 

"Are you going to — kill hirn?" 

"It's not a bad idea. He's in- 
sane, probably homicidal. We 
can't watch him all the time. . . ." 

Gronauer must have seen the 
gun, but his slow pace did not 
slacken. One hand came up, ten- 
derly caressing the vine that 
trailed off his shoulder. 

Hardesty kept the gun level, 
but he did not fire, merely tensed 
his finger on the trigger when 
Gronauer suddenly broke into a 
staggering run toward them. Mar- 
ian gripped Hardesty's arm. 

The old man fell over a rock 
and tried to get up. 

"First time I've seen him stum- 
ble," Hardesty said puzzledly, and 
lowered the gun. "Come on. The 
worst he can do is heave some- 
thing at us. He's unarmed." 

Gronauer was still trying to 
crawl toward them when they 
reached him. He stopped and 
rolled over on one side to look 
up at them. Blood and foam and 
twisted Vines and tangled beard 
could not hide the smile on his 
battered lips. 

Tears glistened on Marian's 
face in the keen starlight. Har- 
desty heard a sob in the radio 
and wanted to hold her close and 
tell it wasn't real, that it had 
never been real, and that the 
flame -colored woods of Earth's 
October lay just beyond the 
jagged, airless pinnacles. But he 
couldn't. Instead, he knelt when 
Gronauer motioned him closer, 
and put his helmet against the 
c n way's. 

Now you will have to stay," 
said Gronauer with feeble tri- 
umph. "I could not get away from 
the ship in time, but that does not 
matter. I am old and would have 
died soon. Then the garden would 
not have anyone to take care of 
it. Now it will.' 

" Killing yourself and maroon- 
ing us for the sake of some lousy 
vegetation," Hardesty said bit- 
terly. "I should have known you 
were crazy and taken off right 
away and sent help back to you." 

Gronauer tried to shake his 
head. "Not crazy* You will gather 
the supplies that were not de- 
stroyed in the explosion and move 
into my cabin. You will read my 
notes and tend my plants . . . 
and become part of the symbiosis* 
as I was.' 


"No, you will hope to be found 
by someone else. That hope will 
keep you from committing sui- 
cide. When you are ready to give 
up hoping, you will be — adjusted* 
You will like it here. This will be 
the home you were searching for; 
this will be your Earth. And you 
will have children — " 

""So your damned garden can 
go on!" 

Gronauer nodded and his smile 
grew wider even while his eyes 
lost their focus, 

"The garden will go on," he 
•aid, just before his breath ceased 
altogether. 

Hardesty stood up. Marian was 
clinging to him and her voice was 
insistent in his earphones, but he 
didn't hear her. He w*s looking 
at the stars, the bright stars which 
neither comforted nor mocked f 
being too remote to care, and the 
green of the plants in the distance, 
and he thought with a chill de- 
spair that even now it looked like 
New England in October.
