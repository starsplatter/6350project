Freudian Slip By FRANKLIN ABEL 

ON the day the Earth van- 
ished, Herman Raye was 
earnestly fishing for trout, 
hip deep in a mountain stream in 
upstate New York, Herman was a tall, serious, sen- 
sitive, healthy, well-muscled 
young man with an outsize jaw 
and a brush of red -brown hair* 
He wore spectacles to correct a 
slight hyperopia, and they had 
heavy black rims because he knew 
his patients expected it. In his 
off hours, he was fond of books 
with titles like Personality and 
the Behavior Disorders, Self- 
esteem and Sexuality in Women, 
Juvenile Totem and Taboo: A 
study of adolescent culture- 
groups, and A New Theory of 
Economic Cycles; but he also 
liked baseball, beer and bebop. 

This day, the last of Herman's 
vacation, was a perfect specimen: 
sunny and still, the sky dotted 
with antiseptic tufts of cloud. The 
trout were biting. Herman had 
two in his creel, and was casting 
into the shallow pool across the 
stream in the confident hope of 
getting another^ when the Uni- 
verse gave one horrible sliding 
lurch, 

Herman braced himself instinc- 
tively, shock pounding through 
his body, and looked down at the 
pebbly stream-bed under his feet. 

It wasn't there. 

He was standing, to all appear- 
ances, in three feet of clear water 
with sheer, black nothing under 
it: nothing, the abysmal color of 
a moonless night, pierced by the 
diamond points of a half-dozen 
incredible stars. 

He had only that single 
glimpse; then he found himself 
gazing across at the pool under 
the far bank, whose waters re- 
flected the tranquil imagery of 



trees. He raised his casting rod, 
swung it back over his snoulder, 
brought it forward again with a 
practiced flick of his wrist, and 
watched the lure drop. 

Within the range of his vision 
now, everything was entirely 
normal; nevertheless, Herman 
wanted very much to stop fishing 
and look down to see if that hor- 
rifying void was still there. He 
couldn't do it. 

Doggedly, he tried again and 
again. The result was always the 
same. It was exactly as if he were 
a man who had made up his mind 
to fling himself over a cliff, or 
break a window and snatch a 
loaf of bread, or say in a loud 
voice to an important person at 
a party, "I think you stink." De- 
termination was followed by ef- 
fort, by ghastly, sweating, heart- 
stopping fear, by relief as he gave 
up and did something else. 

All right, he thought finally, 
there's no point going on with it. 
Data established : hallucination, 
compulsion, inhibition. Where do 
we go from here? 

The obvious first hypothesis 
was that he was insane. Herman 
considered that briefly, and left 
the question open. Three or four 
selected psychoanalyst jokes pa- 
raded through his mind, led by 
the classic, "You're fine, how am 
I?" 

There was this much truth, he 
thought, in the popular belief

that all analysts were a little 
cracked themselves: a good pro- 
portion of the people who get all 
the way through the man-killing 
course that makes an orthodox 
analyst — a course in which an 
M. D. degree is only a beginning 
— -arc impelled to do so in the 
first place by a consuming in- 
terest in their own neuroses. Her- 
man, for example, from the age of 
fifteen up until the completion 
of his own analysis at twenty-six, 
had been so claustrophobic that 
he couldn't force himself into a 
subway car or an elevator. 

But was he now insane? 

Can a foot-rule measure itself? 

Herman finished. At an appro- 
priate hour he waded ashore, 
cleaned his catch, cooked it and 
ate it Where the ground had 
been bare around his cooking 
spot, he saw empty darkness, 
star-studded, rimmed by a tan- 
gled webwork of bare rootlets. He 
tried to go on looking at it when 
he had finished eating the fish. 
He couldn't. 

After the meal, he tried to take 
out his notebook and pen. He 
couldn't. 

In fact, it occurred to him, he 
was helpless to do anything that 
he wouldn't normally have done. 

Pondering that discovery, after 
he had cleaned his utensils and 
finished his other chores, Herman 
crawled into his tent and went to 
sleep. 



Burying the garbage had been 
an unsettling experience. Like a 
lunatic building a machine no- 
body else can see, he had lifted 
successive shovels- full of nothing, 
dropped the empty cans and rub* 
bisK ten inches into nothing, and 
shoveled nothing carefully over 
them again ... 

THE light woke him, long before dawn. From where he lay 
on his back, he could see an in- 
credible pale radiance streaming 
upward all around him, outlining 
the shadow of his body at the 
ridge of the tent, picking out the 
under-surfaces of the trees against 
the night sky. He strained, until 
he was weak and dizzy, to roll 
over so that he could see its 
source; but he had to give up and 
wait another ten minutes until 
his body turned "naturally," just 
as if he had still been asleep. 

Then he was looking straight 
down into a milky transparency 
that started under his nose 
and continued into unguessable 
depths. First came the matted 
clumps of grass, black against the 
light, every blade and root as 
clear as if they had been set in 
transparent plastic. Then longer, 
writhing roots of trees and shrubs, 
sprouting thickets of hair-thin 
rootlets. Between these, and con- 
tinuing downward level by level, 
was spread an infinity of tiny 
specks, seed -shapes, spores. Some 
of them moved, Herman realized 
with a shock. Insects burrowing 
in the emptiness where the Earth 
should be? 

In the morning, when he 
crawled out of the tent and went 
to the bottomless stream to wash, 
he noticed something he had 
missed the day before. The net* 
work of grasses gave springily 
under his feet — not like turf, but 
like stretched rubber. Herman 
conceived an instant dislike for 
walking, especially when he had 
to cross bare ground, because 
when that happened, he felt ex- 
actly what he saw: nothing what- 
ever underfoot. "Walking on air," 
he realized, was not as pleasant 
an experience as the popular songs 
would lead you to expect, 

Herman shaved, cooked and ate 
breakfast, washed the dishes, did 
the chores, and packed up his 
belongings. With a mighty effort. 
he pried out the tent stakes, which 
were bedded in nothing but a 
loose network of roots. He shoul- 
dered the load and carried it a 
quarter of a mile through pine 
woods to his car. 

The car stood at ground level, 
but the ground was not there any 
more. The road was now nothing 
more than a long, irregular trough 
formed by the spreading roots of 
the pines on either side. Shudder- 
ing, Herman stowed his gear in 
the trunk and got in behind the 
wheel. 



When he put the motor into 
gear, the sedan moved sedately 
and normally forward. But the 
motor raced madly, and there was 
no feeling that it was taking hold. 
With screaming engine, Herman 
drove homeward over a nonex- 
istent road. Inwardly and silently, 

he gibbered. 

Six miles down the mountain, 

he pulled up beside a white- 
painted fence enclosing a neat 
yard and a fussy little blue-shut- 
tered house. On the opposite side 
of the fence stood a middle-aged 
woman with a floppy hat awry on 
her head and a gardening trowel 
in one of her gloved hands. She 
looked up with an air of vague 
dismay when he got out of the 
car. 

"Some more eggs today, Dr. 
Raye?" she asked, and smiled. 
The smile was like painted china. 
Her eyes, lost in her fleshy face, 
were clearly trying not to look 
downward. 

"Not today, Mrs. Richards," 
Herman said, "I just stopped to 
say good-by. I'm on my way 
home." 

"Isn't that a -shame?" she said 
mechanically. "Well, come again 
next year." 

Herman wanted to say, "Next 
year I'll probably be in a strait- 
jacket." He tried to say it. He 
stuttered, "N-n-n-n — "and ended, 
glancing at the ground at her feet, 
Transplanting some petunias? 


The woman's mouth worked. 
She said, "Yes. I thought I 
might's well put them along here, 
where they'd get more sun. Aren't 
they pretty?" 

"Very pretty," said Herman 
helplessly. 

The petunias, roots as naked as 
if they had been scrubbed, were 
nesting in a bed of stars. Mrs.' 
Richards' gloves and trowel were 
spotlessly clean. 

ON Fourth Avenue, below 
Fourteenth Street, Herman 
met two frightful little men. 

He had expected the city to be 
better, but it was worse; it was 
a nightmare. The avenues be- 
tween the buildings were bottom- 
less troughs of darkness. The bed- 
rock was gone; the concrete was 

gone; the asphalt was gone. 

The buildings themselves were 
hardly recognizable unless you 
knew what they were. New York 
had been a city of stone — built 
on stone, built of stone, as cold 
as stone. 

Uptown, the city looked half- 
built, but insanely occupied, a 
forest of orange-painted girders. 
In the Village the old brick 
houses were worse. No brick; no 
mortar; nothing but the grotesque 
shells of rooms in lath and a 
paper-thickness of paint. 

The wrought-iron railings were 
gone, too. 

On Fourth Avenue, bookseller's 
row, you could almost persuade 
yourself that nothing had hap- 
pened, provided you did not look 
down. The buildings had been 
made of wood, and wood they re- 
mained. The second-hand books 
in their wooden racks would have 
been comforting except that they 
were so clean. There was not a 
spot of dirt anywhere ; the air wai 
more than country-pure. 

There was an insane selective 
principle at work here, Herman 

realized. Everything from bedrock 

to loam that belonged to the 
Earth itself had disappeared. So 
had everything that had a min- 
eral origin and been changed by 
refinement and mixture : concrete, 
wrought iron, brick, but steel and 
glass, porcelain and paint remained. It looked as if the planet 
had been the joint property of 
two children, one of whom didn't 
want to play any more, so they 
had split up their possessions — 
this is yours, this is yours, thi« 
is mine . . . 

The two little men popped into 
view not six feet in front of 
Herman as he was passing a side* 
walk bookstall. Both were dressed 
in what looked like workmen's 
overalls made of lucite chain- 
mail, or knitted glow-worms. One 
of them had four eyes, two brown, 
two blue, with spectacles for the 
middle pair. Ears grew like cab- 
bages all over his bald head. The 
other had two eyes, the pupils 
of which were cross -shaped, and 
no other discernible features ex- 
cept when he opened his gap- 
toothed mouth: the rest of his 
head, face and all, was completely- 
covered by a dense forest of red 
hair. 

As they came forward, Herman's control of his body suddenly returned. He was trying his 
best to turn around and go away 
from there, and that was what 
his body started to do. Moreover, 
certain sounds of a prayerful 
character, namely "Oh dear sweet 
Jesus/' which Herman was form- 
ing in his mind, involuntarily is- 
sued from his lips. 

Before he had taken the first 
step in a rearward direction, how- 
ever, the hairy little man curved 
around him in a blur of motion, 
barring the way with two long, 
muscular, red -furred arms. Her- 
man turned. The four-eyed little 
man had closed in. Herman, gasp- 
ing, backed up against the book- 
stall. 

People who were headed di- 
rectly for them, although showing 
no recognition that Herman and 
the little men were there, moved 
stiffly aside -like dancing automa- 
tons, strode past, then made an- 
other stiff sidewise motion to 
bring them back to the original 
line of march before they went on 
their way. 

"Olaph dzenn Harm Rai gjo 
glerr-dregnarr?"" demanded Hairy. 



Herman gulped, half-stunned, 

"Huh?" he said. 

Hairy turned to Four-Eyes. 
"Grinnr alaz harisi nuya." 

"Izzred alph! Meggi erdhalaza 
riggbord els kamma gredyik. 
Lukhhal!" 

Hairy turned back to Herman. 
Blinking his eyes rapidly, for they 
closed like the shutter of a cam- 
era, he made a placating gesture 
with both huge furry hands, 
"Kelagg ikri odrum faz," he said, 
and, reaching out to the book- 
stall, he plucked out a handful of 
volumes, fanned them like play- 
ing cards and displayed them to 
Four-Eyes. A heated discussion 
ensued, at the end of which Hairy 
kept For Whom the Bell Tolls, 
Four-Eyes took The Blonde in the 
Bathtub, and Hairy threw the 
rest away. 

Then, while Herman gaped and 
made retching sounds, the two 
disgusting little men tore pages 
out of the books and stuffed them 
in their mouths. When they fin- 
ished the pages, they ate the 
bindings. Then there was a rather 
sick pause while they seemed to 
digest the contents of the books 
they had literally devoured, Her- 
man' had the wild thought that 
they were blurb writers whose 
jobs had gone to their heads. 

The one with the four eyes 
rolled three of them horribly, 
"That's more like it," he said in 
nasal but recognizable English. 

"Let's start over. Are you Her- 
man Raye, the skull doc?" 

Herman produced a series of 
incoherent sounds. 

"My brother expresses himself 
crudely,** said Hairy in a rich, 
fruity baritone. "Please forgive 
him. He is a man of much heart.* 

"Uh?" said Herman. 

"Truly" said Hairy. "And of 
much ears," he added with a 
glance at his companion, "But 
again, as to this affair — tell me 
true, are you Herman Raye, the 
analyst of minds ?" 

"Suppose I am?** Herman 
asked cautiously. 

Hairy turned to Four- eyes, 
"Arghraz iktri 'Suppose I am/ 
Gurh? Olaph iktri err ogromat, 
lekh— " 

"Talk English, can't you?" 
Four -eyes broke in. "You know 
he don't understand, that cave- 
man jabber. Anyhow, yeah, yeah, 
it's him. He just don't want to 
say so/ 1 He reached out and took 
Herman by the collar. "Come on, 
boy, the boss n waitin'." 

There were two circular hair- 
lines of glowing crimson where 
Hairy and Four-eyes had origi- 
nally appeared. They reached the 
spot in one jump, Hairy bringing 
up the rear. 

"But tell me truly," he said 
anxiously. "You are that same 
Herman Raye?" 

Herman paid no attention. Be- 
low, under the two glowing circles* 



was the terrifying gulf that had 
replaced the Earth ; and this time, 
Herman was somehow convinced, 
it was not going to hold him up. 
"Let go!" he shouted, strug- 
gling. "Ouch!" He had struck 
Four-eyes squarely on the flat 
nose, and it felt as if he had 
slugged an anvil. 

Paying no attention, Four -eyes 
turned Herman over, pinned his 
arms to his sides, and dropped 
him neatly through the larger of 
the two circles. 

Herman shut his eyes tightly 
and despairingly repeated the 
multiplication table up to 14 x 14. 
When he opened them again, he 
was apparently hanging in mid- 
space, with Hairy to his left and 
Four- eyes to his right. The visible 
globe around them was so curi- 
ously tinted and mottled that it 
took Herman a long time to 
puzzle it out. Ahead of them was 
the darkest area — the void he had 
seren before. This was oval in 
shape, and in places the stars 
shone through it clearly. In 
others, they were blocked off en- 
tirely or dimmed by a sort of 
haze. 

Surrounding this, and forming 
the rest of the sphere, was an area 
that shaded from gold shot with 
violet at the borders, to an un- 
bearable blaze of glory at the 
center, back the tfay they had 
come and a little to the right. 
Within this lighted section were 

other amorphous areas which 
were much darker, almost opaque; 
and still others where the light 
ahone through diluted to a ruddy 
ghost of itself, like candlelight 
through parchment 

Gradually Herman realized 
that the shapes and colors he saw 
were the lighted and dark hemi- 
spheres of Earth. The dark areas 
were the oceans, deep enough in 
most places to shut out the light 
jaltogether, and those parts of the 
continents, North and South 
America behind him, Europe and 
Asia ahead, Africa down to the 
fight, which were heavily for- 
ested. 

Herman's earlier conviction re- 
turned. Things like this just did 
h pot happen. Physician, heal thy- 

0*1 f! 

"You're not real,* lie said bit- 
terly to Four-eyes, 
i "Not very," Four-eyes agreed. 
►I'm twice as real as that jerk, 
Ihough," he insisted, pointing to 

Hairy. 

Ahead of them, or # *bdow," a 
point of orange light was slowly 
•welling, Herman watched it 
Without much interest. 

Hairy broke out into a torrent 
of cursing. "**I this and that in 
fche milk of your this!" he said* 
►I this, that and the other in the 
this of your that. Your sisterl 
Your cousin! Your grandmother's 
uncle!" 

Four- eyes listened with awed 



approval. #f Them was good books, 
hah?" he asked happily. 

•^Better than those scratching* 
ka the caves,** Hairy said. 

"Something to think about till 
they haul us out again. Well," 
said Four-eyea philosophically, 
Tiere we arc ." 

THE orange spot had enlarged 
into the semblance of a 
lighted room, rather like a stage 
setting. Inside were two enormous 
Persons, one sitting, one standing. 
Otherwise, and except for three 
upholstered chairs, the room was 
bare. No — as they swooped down 

toward it, Herman blinked and 
looked again. A leather couch had 
appeared against the far wall. 

At the last moment, there was 
m flicker of motion off to Her- 
man's left. Something that looked 
Ike a short, pudgy human being 
accompanied by two little men 
the size of Hairy and Four-eyes 
whooshed off into the distance, 
back toward the surface of the 
planet. 

Herman landed. Hairy and 
Four-eyes, after bowing low to 
the standing Person, turned and 
leaped out of the room. When 
Herman, feeling abandoned, 
turned to see where they had 
gone, he discovered that the room 
now had four walls and no win- 
dows or doors. 

The Person said, "How do you 
do, Doctor Raye?" 


Herman looked at htm. Al- 
though his figure had a disquiet- 
ing tendency to quiver and flow, 
so that it was hard to judge, he 
seemed to be about eight feet 
tall. He was dressed in what 
would have seemed an ordinary 
dark-blue business suit, with an 
equally ordinary white shirt and 
blue tie, except that all three 
garments had the sheen of pol- 
ished metal. His face was bony 
and severe, but not repellently 
so; he looked absent-minded 
rather than stern. 

The other Person, whose suit 
was brown, had a broad, kindly 
and rather stupid face; his hair 
was white. He sat quietly, not 
looking at Herman, or, appar- 
ently, at anything else. 

Herman sat down in one of the 
upholstered chairs, "All right/' he 
said with helpless defiance, 
"What's it all about?" 

"I'm glad we can ccpie to the 
point at once," said the Person- 
He paused, moving his lips si- 
lently. "Ah, excuse me. I'm 
sorry/* A second head, with iden- 
tical features, popped into view 
next to the first. His eyes were 
closed. "It's necessary, I'm 
afraid," said head humber one 
apologetically. "I have so much 
to remember, you know " 

Herman took a deep breath and 
said nothing. 

"You may call me Secundus, 
if you like/' resumed the Person, 



"and this gentleman Primus,, 
since it is with him that you will 
have principally to deal. Now, 
our problem here is one of am- 
nesia, and I will confess to you 
frankly that we ourselves are to- 
tally inadequate to cope with it. 
In theory, we are not subject to 
disorders of the mind, and that's 
what makes us so vulnerable now 
that it has happened. Do you 
see?" 

A fantastic sui picion crept into 
Herman's mind. "Just a mo- 
ment," he said carefully. "If you 
don't mind telling me, what is it 
that you have to remember?" 

"Well, Doctor, my field is hu- 
man beings ; that's why it became 
my duty to search you out and 
consult with you. And there is a 
great deal for me to carry in my 
mind, you know, especially under 
these abnormal conditions. I 
don't think I'm exaggerating 
when I say it is a full-time job." 

"Are you going to tell me," 
asked Herman, more carefully 
still, "that this — gentleman — is 
the one who is supposed to re- 
member the Earth itself? The 
rocks and minerals and so on?* 

"Yes, exactly. I was about t* 
tell you—" 

"And that the planet has dis- 
appeared because he has am- 
nesia?" Herman demanded on a 
rising note. 

Secundus beamed, "Concisely 
expressed. I myself, being. 
to speak, saturated with the 
thoughts and habits of human 
beings, who are, you must admit, 
fi garrulous race, could not — " 

"Oh, no!" said Herman. 

"Oh, yes,'* Secundus corrected. 
"I can understand that the idea 
is difficult for you to accept, since 
you naturally believe that you 
yourself have a real existence, or, 
to be more precise, that you be- 
long to the world of phenomena 
»s opposed to that of noumena." 
He beamed. "Now I will be si- 
lent, a considerable task for me, 
and let you ask questions." 

Herman fought a successful 
battle with his impulse to stand 
vtp and shout "To hell with it!" 
He had been through a great deal, 
bu£he was a serious and realistic 
young man, He set himself to 
think the problem through logi- 
cally. If, as seemed more 
than probable, Secundus, Primus, 
Hairy, Four-eyes, and this whole 
Alice - in - Wonderland situation 
existed only as his hallucinations, 
then it did not matter much 
whether he took them seriously or 
not. If they were real, then he 
wasn't, and vice versa. It didn't 
make any difference which was 
which. 

He relaxed deliberately and 
folded his hands against his ab- 
domen. "Let me see if I can get 
this clear," he said. "I'm a nou- 
^tienon, not a phenomenon. Ill 
cruder terms, I exist only in your 



mind. Is that true?" 

Secundus beamed, "Correct." 
, "If you got amnesia, I and the 
rest of the human race would 
disappear." 

Secundus looked worried, "That 
is also correct, and if that should 
happen, you will readily under- 
stand that we would be in diffi- 
culty. The situation is extremely 
— But pardon me, I had prom- 
ised to be silent except when an- 
swering questions." 

"This is the part I fail to un- 
derstand, Mr, Secundus. I gather 
that you brought me here to treat 
Mr. Primus. Now, if I exist as a 
thought in your mind, you neces- 
sarily know everything I know. 
Why don't you treat him your- 
self?" 

Secundus shook his head disap- 
provingly. "Oh, no, Dr. Raye, 
that is not the case at all. It 
cannot be said that I know ev- 
erything that you know; rather 
we should say that I remember 
you. In other words, that I main- 
tain your existence by an act of 
memory. The two functions, 
knowledge and memory, are not 
identical, although, of course, the 
second cannot be considered to 
exist without the first. But before 
we become entangled in our own 
terms, I should perhaps remind 
you that when I employ the word 
'memory* I am only making use 
of a convenient approximation. 
Perhaps it would be helpful to 
say that my memory is compa- 
rable to the structure -memory of 
a living organism, although that, 
too, has certain semantic disad- 
vantages. Were you about to 
make a remark, Doctor?" 

"It still seems to me/' Herman 
Said stubbornly, "that if you re- 
member me, structurally or other- 
wise, that includes everything I 
remember. If you're going to tell 
me that you remember human 
knowledge, including Freudian 
theory and practice, but are un- 
able to manipulate it f that seems 
to me to be contradicted by in- 
ternal evidence in what you've al- 
ready said. For example, it's clear 
that in the field of epistemology — 
the knowledge of knowledge, you 
might say — you have the knowl- 
edge and manipulate it,* 

"Ah/' said Secundus, smiling 
shyly, "but, you see, that hap- 
pens to be my line. Psychoanal- 
ysis and psychotherapy, being 

specializations, are not. As I men- 
tioned previously, persons of our 
order are theoretically not cap- 
able of psychic deterioration. 
That is why we come to you, 
Dr. Raye. We are unable to help 
ourselves; we ask your help. We 
place ourselves unreservedly in 
your hands." 

The question, "How was I 
chosen?" occurred to Herman, but 
he left it unasked. He knew that 
the answer was much likelier to 
be, "At random/* thaat, "Because 



we wanted the most brilliant and 
talented psychoanalyst on the 
planet" 

"I gather that I'm not the first 
person you've tried," he said. 

"Oh, you saw Dr. Buddolphson 
departing? Yes, it is true that in 
our ignorance of the subject we 
did not immediately turn to prac- 
titioners of yotir psychological 
orientation. In fact, if you will 
not be offended, I may say that 
you are practically our last hope. 
We have already had one eminent 
gentleman whose method was 
simply to talk over Mr. Primus's 
problems with him and endeavor 
to help him reach an adjustment; 
he failed because Mr. Primus 
so far as he is aware, has no prob- 
lems except that he has lost his 
memory. Then we had another 
whose system, as he explained it 
to me, was simply to repeat, in a 
sympathetic manner, everything 
that the patient said to him; Mr, 
Primus was not sufficiently prolix 
for this method to be of avail. 

"Then there was another who 
wished to treat Mr. Primus by 
encouraging him to relive his past 
experiences: 'taking him back 
along the time-track/ as he called 
it; but — * Secundus looked 
mournful — "Mr. Primus has ac- 
tually had no experiences in the 
usual sense of the term, though 
he very obligingly made up a num- 
ber of them: Our ontogeny, Dr- 
Raye, is so simple that it cam 

carcely be said to exist at all. 
£ach of us normally has only one 
unction, the one I have already 
ncntioned, and, until this occur- 
ence, it has always been fulfilled 
successfully. m 
"We also had a man who pro- 
ofed to reawaken Mr* Primus's 
icmory by electric shock, but 
Tr. Primus is quite impervious 
o currents of electricity and we 
ere unable to hit upon an ac- 
^ptable substitute. In short, Dr. 
!aye, if you should prove unable 
o help us, we will have no one 
ft to fall back upon except, pos- 
ibly, the Yogi." 

"They might do you more good, 
it that," Herman said, looking 
it Mr. Primus. "Well, Til do what 
I can, though the function of 
analysis is to get the patient to 
accept reality, and this is the op- 
posite. What can you tell me, 
to begin with, about Mr. Primus's 
personality, the onset of the dis- 
turbance, and so on — and, in par- 
ticular, what are you two? Who's 
/our boss? What's it all for and 
iiow does it work?" 

Secundus said, "I can give 
you very little assistance, I am 
afraid. I would characterize 
Primus as a very steady person, 
extremely accurate in his work, 
but not very imaginative. His 
memory loss occurred abruptly, 
mi you yourself witnessed yes- 
terday afternoon. As to your other 
questions — forgive me, Dr. Rayc, 



but it is to your own advantage 
if I fail to answer them. I am, 
of course, the merest amateur in 
psychology, but I sincerely feel 
that your own psyche might be 
damaged if you were to learn the 
fragment of the truth which I 
could give you." 

He paused. A sheaf of papers, 
which Herman had not noticed 
before, lay on a small table that 
he had not noticed, either. Secun- 
dus picked them up and handed 
them over. 

"Here are testing materials," 
he said. "If you need anything 
else, you have only to call on me. 
But I trust you will find these 
complete." 

He turned to go. "And one 
more thing, Dr. Raye," he said 
with an apologetic smile. "Hurry, 
if you possibly can." 

PRIMUS, looking rather like 
a sarcophagus ornament, lay 
limply supine mi the ten-foot 
couch, arms at his sides, eyes 
closed. When Herman had first 
told him to relax, Primus had had 
to have the word carefully ex- 
plained to him; from then on he 
had done it — or seemed to do it 
— perfectly: 

In his preliminary tests, the 
Binet, the Minnesota Multiphasic 
Personality Index and the Ber- 
neuter P. I., he had drawn almost 
a complete blank. Standard test- 
ing methods did not work on Mr Primus, and the reason was ob- 
vious enough. Mr. Primus simply 
was not a human being. 

This room, no doubt, was an 
illusion, and so was Mr. Primus's 
anthropomorphic appearance . . . 
Herman felt like a surgeon try- 
ing to operate blindfolded while 
wearing a catcher's mitt on each 
hand. But he kept trying; he was 
getting results, though whether or 
not they meant anything, he was 
unable to guess. 

On the Rorschach they had 
done a little better, at least in vol- 
ume of response. "That looks like 
a cliff/* Primus would say eag- 
erly. "That looks like a — piece 
of sandstone. This part looks like 
two volcanoes and a cave." Of 
course, Herman realized, the poor 
old gentleman was only trying to 
please him. He had no more idea 
than a goldfish what a volcano 
or a rock looked like, but he 
wanted desperately to help. 

Even so, it was possible to score 
the results. According to Her- 
man's interpretation, Primus was 
a case of arrested infantile sex- 
ualism, with traces of conversion 
hysteria and a strong Oedipus 
complex. Herman entered the pro- 
tocol solemnly in his notes and 
kept going. 

Next came free association, 
and, after that, recounting of 
dreams. Feeling that he might as 
well be hanged for a sheep as 
a lamb, Herman carefully ex- 



plained to Primus what "sleep** 
and "dreams'* were. 

Primus had promised to do his 
best; he had been lying there now, 
without moving, for — how long? 
Startled, Herman looked at his 
watch. It had stopped. 

Scoring the Rorschach alone, 
Herman realized suddenly, should 
have taken him nearly a full day, 
even considering the fact that lie 
hadn't eaten anything, or taken 
time out to rest, or — Herman 
bewilderedly felt his jaw. There 
was only the slightest stubble. 
He didn't feel hungry or tired, or 
cramped from sitting . . . 

"Secundus ! M he called. 

A door opened in the wall to 
his right, and Secundus stepped 
through. The door disappeared. 

"Yes, Dr. Raye? Is anything 
wrong?" 

"How long have I been here?*' 

Secundus' right-hand head 
looked embarrassed. "Well, Doc- 
tor, without bringing in the diffi- 
cult questions of absolute versus* 
relative duration, and the defini- 
tion of an arbitrary position — H 

"Don't stall. How long have I 
been here in my own subjective 
time?" 

"Well, I was about to say, with- 
out being unnecessarily inclusive, 
the question is still very difficult. 
However, bearing in mind that 
the answer is only a rough ap- 
proximation — about one hundred 
hours." 
Herman rubbed his chin, "I 
don't like your tampering with 
me/' he said slowly. "You've 
speeded me up — 4s that it? And 
at the same time inhibited my 
fatigue reactions, and God knows 
what else, so that I didn't even 
notice I'd been working longer 
than I normally could until just 
now?" 

Secundus looked distressed, 
"Fm afraid I have made rather 
a botch of it, Dr. Raye. I should 
not have allowed you to notice 
at all, but it is growing increas- 
ingly difficult to restrain your 
fellow- creatures to their ordinary 
routines. My attention strayed, 
I am sorry to say.' He glanced 
at the recumbent form of Primus. 
"My word! What is Mr. Primus 
doing, Dr. Raye?" 

"Sleeping," Herman answered 
curtly. 

"Remarkable! I hope he does 
not make a habit of it. Will he 
awaken soon, do you think, Doc- 
tor?" 

"I have no idea," said Herman 
helplessly; but at that moment 
Primus stirred, opened his eyes, 
and sat up with his usual vague, 
kindly smile* 

"Did you dream?" Herman 
asked him. 

Primus blinked slowly, "Yes. 
Yes, I did," he said in his pro- 
foundly heavy voice. 

"Tell me all you can remember 

about it," 



"Well, said Primus, sinking 
back onto the couch, "I dreamed 
I was in a room with a large bed. 
It had heavy wooden posts and a 
big bolster. I wanted to lie down 
and rest in the bed, but the bolster 
made me uncomfortable. It was 
too dark to see, to rearrange the 
bed, so I tried to light a candle, 
but the matches kept going 
out . . .* 

Herman took it all down, word 
for word, with growing excite- 
ment and growing dismay. The 
dream was too good. It might have 
come out of Dr. Freud's original 
case histories. When Primus had 
finished, Herman searched back 
through his notes. Did Primus 
know what a bed was, or what 
a bolster was, or a candle? How 
much had Herman told him? 

"Bed" was there, of course. 
Primus: "What are 'dreams?'" 
Herman: "Well, when a human 
being goes to bed, and sleeps . . . " 
"Bolster" was there, too, but not 
in the same sense. Herman: "To 
bolster its argument, the uncon- 
scious — what we call the id— 
frequently alters the person's likes 
and dislikes on what seem to be 
petty and commonplace subjects 
..." And "candle?" Herman: "1 
want you to understand that I 
don't know all about this subject 
myself, Mr. Primus. Nobody 
does; our knowledge is just a 
candle in the darkness ..." 

Herman gave up. He glanced 
At Secundus, who was watching 
him expectantly. "May I talk to 
you privately?" 

"Of course." Secundus nodded 
to Primus p who stood up awk- 
wardly and *then vanished with 
a. pop. Secundus tut-tutted regret- 
fully. 

Herman took a firm grip on 
himself. "Look/* he said, "the 
data I have now suggest that 
Primus had some traumatic ex- 
perience in his infancy which ar- 
rested his development in various 
ways and also strengthened his 
Oedipus complex — that is, inten- 
sified his feelings of fear, hatred 
and rivalry toward his father. 
Now, that may sound to you as 
if we're making some progress. 
I would feel that way myself — 
if I had the slightest reason for 
believing that Primus ever had 
a father/' 

Secundus started to speak; but 
Herman cut him off. "Wait, let 
me finish. I can go ahead on that 
basis, but as far as I'm concerned 
I might just as well be counting 
the angels on the head of a pin. 
You've got to give me more in- 
formation, Secundus. I want to 
know who you are, and who 
Primus is, and whether there's 
any other being with whom 
Primus could possibly have a 
filial relationship. And if you 
can't tell me all that without giv- 
ing me the Secret of the Uni- 
verse, then you'd better give it to 



me whether it's good for me or 
not. I can't work in the dark." 
Secundus pursed his lips. 
"There is justice in what you say, 
Dpctor. Very well, I shall be en- 
tirely frank v with you — in so far 
as it is possible for me to do so, 
of course. Let's see, where can 
I- begin?" 

"First question," retorted Her- 
man. "Who are you?" 

"We are—" Secundus thought 
a moment, then spread his hands 
with a helpless smile. "There are 
no words, Doctor. To put the case 
in negatives, we are not evolved 
organisms, we are not mortal, 
we are not, speaking in the usual 
sense, alive, although, of course — 
I hope you will not be offended — 
neither are you." 

Herman's brow wrinkled. "Are 
you real? 9 * he demanded finally. 

Secundus looked embarrassed. 
"You have found me out, Dr. 
Raye. I endeavored to give you 
that impression — through vanity, 
I am ashamed to say — but, un- 
happily, it is not true. I, too, be- 
long to the realm of noumena," 

"Then, blast it all, what is 
real? This planet isn't. You're 
not. What's it all for?" He paused 
a moment reflectively. "We're get- 
ting on to my second question, 
about Primus's attitude toward 
his 'father.' Perhaps I should have 
asked just now, 'Who is real?* 
Who remembers you, Secundus?" 

"This question, unfortunately, 
Is the one I cannot answer with 
complete frankness, Doctor, I 
assure you that it is not because 
I do not wish to; I have no option 
in the matter, I can tell you only 
that there is a Person of whom 
it might be said that He stands 
in the parental relationship to 
Primus, to me, and all the rest 
of our order." 

"God?" Herman inquired, "Jah- 
weh? Allah?" 

"Please, no names, Doctor.* 
Secundus looked apprehensive, 

"Then, damn it, tell me the 
rest!" Herman realized vaguely 
that he was soothing his own hurt 
vanity at Secundus's expense, but 
he was enjoying himself too much 
to stop. "You're afraid of some- 
thing; that's been obvious right 
along. And there must be a time 
limit on it, or you wouldn't be 
rushing me. Why? Are you afraid 
that if this unnamable Person 
finds out you've botched your 
job, He'll wipe you out of ex- 
istence and start over with a new 
bunch?" 

A cold wind blew down Her- 
man's back. "Not us alone, Dr. 
Raye," said Secundus gravely. "If 
the Inspector discovers this blun- 
der — and the time is coming soon 
when He must — no corrections 
will be attempted. When a mis- 
take occurs, it is — painted out." 

"Oh," aaid Herman after a 
moment. He rat down again, 
weakly. "How long have wc got?" 



"Approximately one and a 
quarter days have gone by at the 
Earth's normal rate since Primus 
lost his memory," Secundus said. 
"I have not been able to 'speed 
you up/ as you termed it, by more 
than a twenty-to-one ratio. The 
deadline will have arrived, by my 
calculation, in fifteen minutes of 
normal time, or five hours at 
your present accelerated rate." 

Primus stepped into the room, 
crossed to the couch and lay 
down placidly. Secundus turned 
to go, then paused. 

"As for your final question. 
Doctor — you might think of the 
Universe as a Pointillist paint- 
ing, in which this planet is one 
infinitesimally small dot of color. 
The work is wholly imaginary, of 
course, since neither the canvas 
nor the pigment has what you 
would term an independent exist- 
ence. Nevertheless, the artist 
takes it seriously. He would not 
care to find, so to speak, mus- 
taches daubed on it." 

Herman sat limply, staring 
after him as he moved to the 
door. Secundus turned once more. 

"I hope you will not think that 
I am displeased with you, Doc* 
tor," he said. "On the contrary, 
I feel that you are accomplish- 
ing more than anyone else has. 
However, should you succeed, as 
I devoutly hope, there may not 
be sufficient time to congratulate 
you as you deserve, I shall have 
to replace you . immediately in 
your normal world-line, for your 
absence would constitute as no- 
ticeable a flaw as that of the 
planet. In that event, my present 
thanks and congratulations will 
have to serve." 

With a friendly smile, he dis- 
appeared. 

Herman wound his watch. 

Two hours later, Primus's an- 
swers to his questions began to 
show a touch of resentment and 
surly defiance. Transference, Her- 
man thought, with a constriction 
of his throat, and kept working 
desperately, / 

Three hours. "What does the 
bolster remind you of?" 

"I seem to see a big cylinder 
rolling through space, sweeping 
the stars out of its way . . . " 

Four hours. Only three minutes 
left now, in the normal world. 
I can't wait to get any deeper, 
Herman thought. Ifs got to be 
now or never: 

"You must understand that 
these feelings of resentment and 
hatred are normal/ 1 he said, try- 
ing to keep the strain out of his 
voice, "but, at the same time, you 
have outgrown them — -you can 
rise above them now. You are an 
individual in your own right, 
Primus. You have a job to do that 
only you can fill, and it's an im- 
portant job. That's what matters, 
not all this infantile emotional 
clutter , . . " 



He talked on, not daring to 
look at his watch. 

Primus looked up, and a huge 
smile broke over his face. He be- 
gan, "Why, of— " 

TTERMAN found himself walk- 
-"-*• ing along Forty-second 
Street, heading toward the Hud- 
son. The pavement was solid un- 
der his feet; the canyon betv/een 
the buildings was filled with the 
soft violet-orange glow of a sum- 
mer evening in New York. In the 
eyes of the people he passed, he 
saw the same incredulous relief 
he felt. It was over. He'd done 
it. 

He'tjl broken all the rules, but, 
incredibly, he'd got results. 

Then he looked up and a chill 
spread over him. No one who 
knew the city would accept 
tb&t ithy phallic parody as the 
Empire State Building, or those 
huge fleshy curves, as wanton as 
the mountains in which Mr. 
Maugham's "Sadie Thompson* 
had her lusty existence, as the 
prosaic hills* of New Jersey. 

Psychoanalysis had certainly 
removed Mr. Primus's inhibitions. 
The world was like a fence 
scrawled on by a naughty little 
boy. Mr. Primus would outgrow 
it in time, but life until then 
might be somewhat disconcerting. 

Those two clouds, for in- 
stance ...
