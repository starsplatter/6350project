Lover when you're near me By RICHARD MATHESON 

THE silvery ship came rush- 
ing in backward through 
the veils of broken cloud, 
tobogganing down the atmos- 
phere of Station Four. Fires of 
deceleration jetted red from the 
reactor ports, roaring their hur- 
ricane thrust against the clutch of 
gravity. 

Air thickened; the glittering 
rocket speck slid easier, settling 
down like a parachuting missile. 
Sunlight splashed its metal sides 
with light and the blue ocean 
waters billowed wide to swallow 
it. The ship dipped in a wide arc 
and backed down toward the 
reddish-green-clad land. 

Inside its tiny cabin, the three 
men lay strapped and waiting for 
the shock of contact. Their eyes 
were closed, their hands tight and 
blood-drained. 

Muscle blocks struggled against 
the drag. 

The ground swept up. The ship 
settled hard on its rear braces, 
trembling. Then, finally, it stood 
motionless and silent, success- 
fully navigated through scores of 
light years of vacuum night. 

A quarter mile away were the 
 warehouse, village and house. 

CRITICAL. That was official 
record. Station Four, the 
Three-Moon Psycho Ward, 
David Lin dell knew it; all the 
Wentner men knew and won- 
dered. 

Wentner's Interstellar Trading 
Company put a man on other 
stations, for two years at a clip. 
Here on Four it was only for six 
months. Why? Because it was 
critical. Why? Nobody could 
stand the place longer than six 
months. Why? It always came to 
"why " ? 

"But like I always say," Lindell 
said, "it's no use worrying my- 
self." 

JJe said it to Martin, the ship's 
co-pilot, as the two of them 
trudged across the wide meadow 
toward the distant compound, 
carrying LindeH's luggage, 

"You have the right idea," 
said Martin. "Don't worry your- 
self." 

"That's what I always say " 
said Lindell. "They're paying me 
enough and they have to take 
care of me if anything happens. 
Its their headache." 

They passed the silent gargan- 
tuan warehouse. The sliding 
doors were half open and, inside, 
Lindell could see the concrete 
floor empty and sunlight filter- 
ing bright ribbons through the 
skylight. Martin told him the 
cargo ship had emptied it out 
a few weeks before. Lindell grunt- 
ed and shifted his luggage. 

"Where are the workers?" he 
asked, 

Martin gestured toward the 
native village about three hun- 
dred yards away. There was no 
sound from the low-slung white 
dwellings methodically arranged 
to form three sides of a rectangle. 
The windows blinked fiercely in 
the sunlight. 

"Guess they're sacked down," 
Martin judged. "They sleep a lot 
when work is done. You'll see 
them tomorrow when shipments 
start coming in again." 

"Got their families with them?" 
Lindell asked. 
'Nope.' 

Thought it was company pol- 
icy." 

"Not here. The Gnees don't 
have much family life. Too few 
men and practically all of them 
pretty dumb." 

"Great," Lindell said, "Dandy." 
He shrugged. "Well, it's no use 
worrying myself about it." 

While they were on the stairs 
to the hallway of the house, he 
asked Martin where Corrigan 
was. 

"He went home with the cargo 
ship," Martin said. "The com- 
pany allows that once in a while. 
There's nothing to do here any- 
way after the goods are picked 
up." 


Oh, said Lindell. "What's 
this door?" He kicked it open and 
looked in at the combination 
living room-library. 

E A11 the comforts of," he said. 
More," said Martin, looking 
over LindeH's shoulder. "Over 
there you have a movie projector 
and a tape recorder." 

"Swell." Lindell said. "I can 
talk to myself legal." Then he 
grimaced, "Let's dump these 
bags. My arms are falling off." 

They shuffled down the hall 
and Lindell glanced into the 
srinall kitchen as they passed. It 
was porcelain-paneled and well 
kept, 

"Can this Gnee woman cook?" 
he asked. 

"From what I hear," said Mar- 
tin, "you'll be packing it in like 
a king." 

"Glad to hear it. Incidentally, 
you got any idea why they call 
this joint the Three- Moon Psycho 
Ward?" 

Who calls it?" 
The boys back on Earth." 
The boys are all wet You'll 
like it here." 

"But why is it only a six month 
stint?" 

"I don't know — maybe the 
company doesn't want its help to 
stay here for good." said Martin. 
"Here's your bedroom." 


AS they entered, the Gnee 
woman was making the bed, 
her back to the door. They
thumped down the bags and she 
turned slowly, unalarmed or 
startled. Lindell's hands twitched 
Oh, well, he thought, I've seen 
worse in my day. 

She wore a heavy robe fastened 
at the neck and falling to the 
floor like a truncated cone of 
cloth. All he could see was her 
head. 

It was a squat coarsejy grained 
head, pink and hairless — like the 
mottled belly of an expecting 
chihuahua, he decided. For ears, 
there were cavities on the sides 
of her flat chinless face. Her nose 

was a stub, singlc-nostriled. Hex 
lips were thick and monkeylike 
outlining a small circle of mouth 

Hello, Lover, Lindell decided 
not to say. 

She came across the room 
quietly and he blinked at her 
eyes. Then she placed a moist, 
spongy hand in his. 
Hya," he said. 

She can't hear," Martin said. 
Telepathic." 

"That's right, I forgot." 

Hello, he thought, and Hello 
came back the answering wel- 
come. It is good to have you. 

"Thanks," he said. She seems 
like a decent kid, he thought to 
himself; weird but homy. A ques- 
tion touched his brain like a 
timid hand. 

"Yeah, sure," he said. Fes, he 
added in his mind. 



"What's that?" Martin asked. 

"She asked if she should un- 
pack. I think." Lindell slumped 
down on the bed. "Ah," he said, 
"this I like." He pushed exploring 
fingers into the mattress. 

"Say, how do you know it's a 
she?" he asked when he and Mar- 
tin were walking back down the 
hill while the Gnee woman un- 
packed. 

"The robe. The males don't 
wear robes." 

"That's all?" 

Martin looked away. "A few 
other things of absolutely no in- 
terest to you." 

They moved into the living 
room and Lindell tried out the 
easy chair for size. He leaned 
ba$J" and stroked the arms with 
satisfied fingers. 

"Critical of not," he said, "this 
station has 'em all beat for com- 
fort." 

He sat there, momentarily re- 
membering the woman's eyes" 
Thfcy had seemed huge, covering 
a full third of her face, like 
feig glass saucers with dark cup 
rings for pupils. And they were 
moist; bowls of liquid. He 
shrugged and let it go. So what, 
he thought, it's nothing. 

"Hah? What?" he asked, hear- 
ing Martin's voice, 

"I said be careful." Martin was 
hfclding up a shiny gas pistoL 
"This is loaded," he warned, 

"Who needs it?" 

'You won't. Just standard 
equipment." Martin dropped it 
back in the desk drawer and 
shoved the drawer back in. "And 
you know where all your books 
are," he said. "The warehouse 
office is set up like all the other 
station offices." 
Lindell nodded. "I won't get 

lost." 

Martin glanced at his watch. 
"Well, I have to be going. Let's 
see," he continued, as he and 
Lindell started for the door, "any- 
thing else to tell you? You know 
the rule about not harming the 
people, of course." 

"Who's gonna harm them? 
Whoops!" 

They'd almost knocked her 
over as they exited from the 
room. She jumped back one more 
bouncy step and stared at them, 
eyes wide and frightened. 

"Take it easy, kiddo," Lindell 
soothed. "What's up?" 

Eat? The thought cringed before 
him like a beggar at the back 
door of his mind. 

He pursed his lips and nodded. 
"You took the words right out of 
my head." 

He looked at her and concentrated. Vll be back as soon as I 
walk the co-pilot to his ship. 
Make something good. 

She nodded violently and rush- 
ed toward the kitchen. " / 

"Where's she off to like a bat?" 
Martin asked curiously, as they

turned for the stairs, 

"She's going to rustle me a 
snack," Lindell chuckled as they 
descended. "That's what I call 
service de luxe. This telepathy 
is okay, you know? At other 
stations it was either learn half 
the language to get a ham sand- 
wich or try and teach 'em Eng- 
lish so I wouldn't starve. Either 
way I really had to sweat for my 
supper until things got settled/" 

He looked pleased. 

"This is real hot," he said. 

Their heavy boots crushed 
down the tall crisp blue grass as 
they approached the upright ship. 

Martin held out his hand. 
"Take it easy, Lindell. See you in 
six months." 

"Right enough. Give old man 
Wentner a kick in the pants for me. 

"Will do." 

He watched the co-pilot dwin- 
dle in size, ascending the metal 
ladder to the hatchway. A mid- 
get Martin pulled himself into the 
ship and clanged the metal port 
shut. Lindell waved back at the 
tiny figure at the port and then 
turned and walked away to es- 
cape the blast. 

He stood on a hill underneath 
the heavy scarlet foliage of a tree. 
Inside the ship's belly there was 
a liquid cough, a rush of explod- 
ing gases. He watched the ship 
hang for a moment on its flaming 
exhaust and then flash up into the 
green-blue sky, leaving scorched 
ground in its wake. The next in- 
stant it was gone. 

He walked in lazy strides back 
toward the house, gazing ap- 
preciatively at the profusion of 
livid plants and flowers in the 
meadow around him, bulbous in- 
sects hanging over them. 

He took off his jacket and let it 
hang from one hand as he walked. 
The sun felt good on his lean 
back. 

"Boys,"" he said to the fragrant 
air, "you're all wet." 

- 

^T^HE great blazing sun was al- 
-■- most gone, spraying the sky 
red with the blood of its cyclic 
dying. Soon the three moons 
would rise — guaranteed to drive 
insane a man looking for a shad" 
ow he could call his own. 

Lindell sat at the living room 
window, gazing out over the 
countryside. You couldnt beat it, 
he thought; for air or climate or 
all the things that grew in Earth- 
paling technicolor. Nature outdid 
herself in this tucked-away cor- 
ner of the Galaxy. 

He sighed and stretched, won- 
dering about supper. 

Drink? 

He started, chopping a yawn in 
half, and drew his fingers togeth- 
er so fast that the knuckle bones 
crackled. 

He saw her standing at his 
side offering a tray with a glass 
on it. He reached for it, feeling 
his heart placate itself after the 
initial jolt 

"I'd knock or something," he 
suggested. 

The big eyes were elliptical 
now. They stared at him without 
comprehension. 

"Well, let it go." he said, after 
a sip of the warm, tangy liquid. 
He smacked his lips and took 
another sip, a long one. 

"Damn good," he said. 
"Thanks, Lover." 

He blinked at himself. That 
brings a guy up short, he decided. 
Lover? Of all the unlikely names 
in the Universe. . . . 

He glanced at her with a 
chuckle bubbling up in his throat. 
, She hadn't moved. Her face 
was screwed up into what he as- 
sumed was a smile. But her 
mouth wasn't designed for smil- 
ing. 

"Hey, when are we eating?" he 
asked, feeling an edge uncomfort- 
able under the unmoving gaze of 
her watery eye globes. 

She turned and hurried to the 
door. 

There she turned. 

All ready already, he got the 
the message" 

He grinned, downed the drink, 
got up and followed her eager 
shuffle down the dim hallway. 

Some time later he pushed 
©way the plate with a sigh and 
leaned back in the chair. 



"That's what I call good," he 
said. 

Like a hidden spring, he felt 
her pleasure well up in his mind. 
Lover thanks you. 

She certainly picked up the 
name fast, he thought 

She looked at him, eyes wide. 

Was she, trying to smile again? 
he wondered. To him the ex- 
pression looked like all her others 
— the facial poses of an idiot. 
He thought she was smiling, 
though, because of the thoughts 
that accompanied the expression. 

Then he found his eyes invol- 
untarily watering in empathy and 
he turned his head, blinking, A 
trifle nervously, he dumped a tea- 
spoon of sugar in his coffee and 
stirred. He could still feel her 
gaze on him. A twinge of dis- 
pleasure marred his thoughts and 
she turned away abruptly. That's 
better, he thought, and felt all 
right again. 

"Hey, tell me, Lover," he start- 
ed to say. Well, might as well 
get used to it, he figured. 

You have a husband? 

Her returned thoughts were 
confused. 

A mate? he re -worded. 

Oh, yes. 

In the worker's village? 

They have no mates, she said, 
and he thought he sensed a note 
of hauteur in her reply. 

He shrugged and took a sip of 
coffee. "Well," he said, "one satisfied worker would drive the rest 
of 'era crazy anyway. They'd be 
biting their nails if they have 
nails. And on that note — good 
night." 

In bed he sat writing in his 
much ^used diary. Between its 
battered covers were inscribed the 
sparse comments he had made on 
half a dozen different planets. 
This was his seventh station. 

"My lucky number,"' he para- 
graphed in blue ink. 

Again no sound. To sleep? His 
pen skiddled and spat out three 
fat blots. He looked up and saw 
her with the tray again. 

"Yeah," he said. Yeah. Thanks, 
Lover. But, look, will you just 
let me know when you. . . . He 
stopped, seeing that it was hope- 
less. 

"This will make me sleep?" he 
asked. 

Oh, yes, was the reply. 

He took a sip, looking down at 
the ink -blotted page. Just started 
it anyway, he thought; no loss oi 
priceless literature. He ripped out 
the page and crumpled it in one 

hand. 

"This is good stuff," he said, 
nodding his head toward the glass. 
He held up the paper. 

Throw it away, hah? Throw 
away? she asked. 

"That's right," he said. "Now 
clear out. What in hell are you 

doing in a man's boudoir any- 
way?" 



She scuttled across the floor 
and he grinned as she closed the 
door quietly behind herself. 

Finishing the drink, he set it 
down on the bedside table and 
turned off the lamp, tie settled 
back on the soft pillow with a 
sigh. Critical, he thought in drow" 
sy satisfaction. Nuts. 

Good night. 

He opened his heavy-lidded 
eyes and looked around. There 
was no one in the room. He sank 
back. 

Good night. 

He raised up on one elbow« 
squinting into the darkness. 

Good night. 

"Oh," he said. "Good night, 
yourself." The thoughts abated. 
He fell back again and made his 
mouth a tooth-edged cave with 
yawning. 

•■How about that?" he mutter- 
ed thickly, turning on his side. 
"Absolutely no mirrors. See? 
Nothin' up my sleeves. Howbou- 
that." 

He had a dream. The dream 
covered him with sweat. 

AFTER breakfast, he left the house with her farewells tugging at his brain, and headed 
across the grounds for the ware- 
house. Already, he saw, the Gnee 
men were formed in a moving 
line, carrying bundles on their 
heads. They marched into the 
warehouse, deposited their burden on the concrete and had it 
checked off by a Gnee foreman 
who stood in the center of the 
floor, holding a clipboard thick 
with paper-thin vouchers. 

As Lindell approached, the 
men all bowed and looked more 
cowed as they hastened on their 
rounds. He noticed that their 
heads were flatter than Lover's, 
a little more darkly tinted, and 
with smaller eyes. Their bodies 
were broad and thick-muscled. 

They do look stupid, he 
thought. 

As he came up to the man who 
was doing the checking and sent 
out an unanswered thought, he 
saw that they weren't telepathic 
either. Or maybe didn't want to 

be. 

"How doody," said the man in 
a squeaky voice. "I check. You 
check?" 

"That's okay," Lindell said, 
pushing back the clipboard. "Just 
bring it into the office when the 
first batch is all in." 

"What, hah?" said the man. 

Jeez, are you a case, Lindell 
thought: "Bring this," he said, 
tapping the clipped sheaf of pap- 
ers, "Bring to office." He pointed 
again. "Bring to me . . . me! When 
goods are all in." 

The man's splotchy face lit up 
with a look of eager stupidity and 
he nodded brightly. Lindell pat- 
ted his shoulder. Good boy, rasp- 
ed his mind. I bet you're dyna- 



mite in a crisis. 

He headed for the office, grit- 
ting his teeth. 

Inside, he shut the plastiglass 
door behind him and looked 
around the office. It was all the 
same as he remembered from 
other stations, except for the cot 
in one corner. 

Don't tell me I have to sleep 
out here nights, he thought with 
a groan. 

He moved closer. On the flat 
soil-cased pillow was the imprint 
of a head. He picked up a light 
brown hair. And what in the hell 
is this? he wondered. Under the 
cot he found a belt without a 
buckle. On the wall by the cot 
there were violent scratches, as 
though a man in fever had tried 
to get out of the office the hard 
way. He stared at them. 

The joint is haunted, he con- 
cluded with a vague shake of his 
head. Then he turned away with 
a shrug. No use worrying myself, 
he thought. I got six months to 
go and nothing's going to get me 
down. 

He sat down quickly before the 
desk and dragged the heavy sta- 
tion log before himself. He flipped 
open, the heavy cover and started 
reading from the beginning. 

The first entries were twenty 
years dry. They were signed Jef- 
ferson Winters or, a little later, 
a hasty Jeff. At the end of six 
months and fifty-two closely 



82 




 



packed pages, Lindell found page 
53 covered with a floridly penned 
message, "Station Four, good -by 
forever V 9 Jeff didn't seem to have 
had any difficulties adjusting to 
the life there. 

Lindell shifted back in the 
creaking chair and pulled the 
heavy book on his lap with a sigh 
of boredom. 

It was after the first replace- 
ment's second month that the 
entries started to get ragged. 
There were blurred words, hur- 
ried scrawling, mistakes deleted 
and re-done. Some of the errors 
apparently had been corrected 
much later by still another re- 
placement. 

It was that way through the 
next four hundred or so sleep - 
inducing pages: a sorry chain of 
flaws and eventual correction. 
Lindell flipped through them 
wearily without the slightest in- 
terest in their content. 

Then he reached the entries 
signed Bill Corrigan and, with a 
blinking yawn, he straightened 
himself up, propped the book on 
the desk and paid closer atten- 
tion. 

i 

They were the same as in every 
case before, excluding the first 
one — efficient beginnings declin- 
ing markedly to, increased wild- 
ness, the penmanship erring more 
extravagantly with each month 
until, at last, it became almost 
illegible. He found a few blat- 



antly miscalculated additions 
which he corrected in his careful 
hand. 

Corrigan's writing, he noted, 
broke off in the middle of a word 
one afternoon. And for the last 
month and a half of Corrigan's 
stay, there were nothing but 
blank pages. He thumbed through 
them carelessly, shaking his head 
slowly^ 

Have to admit it, he thought. 
i don't get it. 

SITTING in the living room 
through twilight and, later, 
at supper, he began to get the 
sensation that Lover's thoughts 
were somehow alive, like micro- 
scopic insects crawling in and out 
among the fissures of his brain. 
Sometimes they barely moved; 
other times they leaped excitedly. 
Once, when he became a little ir- 
ritated with her staring, the 
thoughts were like invisible sup- 
pliants pawing weepily at his 
mind. 

What was worse, he realized 
while reading in bed, the sensa- 
tion occurred even when she 
wasn't in the same room with 
him. It was disconcerting enough 
to feel an endless stream of 
thoughts flowing into him white 
she was close; this remote con- 
trol business was just a little too 
much for his taste. 

Hey, how abo&t it? he tried to 
reason her away good-naturedly. 



LOVEft WHEN YOU'RE 



EAR ME 



n 



But all he got back was the pic- 
ture of her looking at him wide- 
eyed and uncomprehending. 

"Ah, nuts/" he muttered and 

tossed his book on the bedside 

table. Maybe that's it, he thought, 

settling down for the night; this 

telepathy gimick. Maybe that 

vas what got the other men. Weil, 

tot me, he vowed. J just won't 

/orry myself about it. And he 

Aimed out the lamp, said good 

light to the air and went to 

leep. 

"Sleep," he muttered, unaware, 
only partly conscious. It wasn't 
sleep. Not deep enough by half. 
A cloudy haze submerged his 
mind and filled it with the same 
detailed scene. It telescoped and 
sank away in a burst. It magni- 
fied, welling up and swallowing 
him and everything. 

Lover, Lover. The echo of a 
shriek in a long black corridor. 
The robe fluttering close by. He 
saw her pale features. "No," he 
said, "stay away. Far, close, be- 
yond, upon." He cried out. "No. 
No. NO!" 

He jolted up in the darkness 
with a choking grunt, eyes full 
open. He stared groggily around 
the empty bedroom, his thoughts 
broiling. 

He reached out in the darkness 
and flicked on the lamp. Hur- 
riedly, he stuck a cigarette be- 
tween his lips and lay slumped 
against the headboard, blowing 



out clouds of curling smoke. He 
raised his hand and saw that it 
shook. He muttered words with- 
out sense. 

Then his nostrils twitched and 
his lips drew back in revulsion. 
What the hell died? he thought. 
There was a heavy saccharine 
odor in the air, getting worse 
every second. He tossed off the 
covers. 

At the foot of the bed he 
found them — a thick pile of livid 
purple flowers arranged as an 
offering. 

He looked at them a moment 
and then bent over to pick them 
up and throw them away. He 
drew back, gasping, as a thorn 
punctured his right thumb. 

He pressed out bright blood 
drops and sucked the wound, his 
brain assailed by the thickening 
smell of the ugly blooms. 

jr'S very nice oi you, he sent 
her the message, but no more 
flowers. 

She looked at him. She doesn't 
get it, he knew. 

"Do you understand?" he 
asked. 

Floods of affection gurgled over 
the layers of his brain like syrup. 
He stirred his coffee restlessly 
and the transfer eased as though 
she were determined not to offend 
him" The kitchen was silent ex- 
cept for the clink of his silver on 
the breakfast dishes and the slight

whispering rustle of her robe. 

He gulped down coffee and 
stood up to leave, 

Fll eat lunch around . . . 

/ know. Her thought cut into 
his, mildly commanding. He 
grinned a little to himself as he 
headed down the hall. Her tele- 
pathed message had come with 
an almost motherlike chiding. 

Then, crossing the grounds, he 
recalled the dream again and the 
departing grin emptied his fea- 
tures of amusement. 

All morning he wondered ir- 
ritably what made the Gnee men 
so stupid. If they dropped a bun- 
dle, it was a project to pick it up 
again. They're like brainless 
cows , he thought, watching them 
through the office windows as 
they plodded through their tasks, 
eyes dull and unblinking, their 
thick shoulders sloping inward. 

He knew definitely now that 
they weren't telepathic. He'd tried 
several times to give them orders 
with his mind alone and there 
was no receipt of message. They 
reacted only to loudly repeated 
words of two syllables or, pref- 
erably, less. And they reacted 
moronieally at that. 

In the middle of the morning 
he looked up from the backlog 
of paper work that Corrigan had 
left and realized, with some 
shock, that her thoughts were 
reaching him all the way from 
the house. 



And yet they weren't thoughts 
he could translate into words. 
They were just sensations, amor" 
phously present. He got the feel- 
ing that she was checking, send- 
ing out exploratory beams now 
and again to see if all was well 
with him. 

The first few times it did no 
more than amuse him: he 
chuckled softly and went back to 
his work,. 

But then the proddings as- 
sumed an annoyingly regular 
time pattern and he began to 
squirm in his chair. He found 
himself becoming rigidly erect 
and anticipating them seconds be- 
fore they came. 

By late morning he was repuls- 
ing them consciously, tossing his 
pen on the desk and ordering her 
angrily to leave him alone when 
he worked. Her thoughts would 
break off contritely — and soon 
come back agairt, like creeping 
things that stole upon him, in- 
sinuating and beyond insult. 

His nerves began to fray a 
little. He left the office and 
prowled the warehouse floor, tear- 
ing open bundles and checking 
goods with impatient fingers. The 
thoughts followed him around 
faithfully, 

"How doody," said the Gnee 
foreman every time Lindell 
passed, making him angrier yet. 

Once he straightened up sud- 
denly over a bundle and said 
loudly, "Go away!" 

The foreman jumped a foot in 
the air. His pencil and clipboard 
went flying, and he hid behind a 
pillar and looked fearfully at 
LindelL 

Lindell pretended not to notice. 

LATER, back in the office, he 
sat thinking, the open log 
book before him. 

No wonder the Gnee men didn't 
telepath, he thought. They knew 
what was good for them. 

Then he looked out the window 
at the plodding line of workers. 

What if they weren't just 
avoiding telepathy? What if they 
were incapable of it; had once 
held the ability and, because of 
it, hqfi been broken to their pres- 
ent state of witless stolidity? 

He thought of what Martin had 
said about the women outnum- 
bering the men. And a phrase en- 
tered his brain — matriarchy by 
mind. The phrase offended him, 
but he was suddenly afraid that 
it might be true. It would explain 
why the other men had cracked. 
For if the women were in con- 
trol, it might well be that, in their 
inherent lust for dominance, they 
made no distinction between their 
own men and the men from 
Earth. A man is a man is a man. 
He twisted angrily at the idea of 
possibly being considered on a 
level with the dolts who lived in 
the village. 



He stood up abruptly. I'm not 
hungry, he thought, not at all. 
But Vm going back to the house 
and order her to make me lunch 
and let her know Vm not hungry 
either. 111 make her used to be- 
ing dominated herself and then 
shell get no chance to pick at 
me. No hug-eyed female Gnee, 
by God, is going to get me down! 

Then he blinked and turned 
away quickly when he realized 
that he was staring at the wild 
pattern of scratches on the far 
office wall, and the belt without 
a buckle that still curled limply 
underneath the cot. 

^FHE dream again. It tore at 
■" his brain tissues with claws 
of razor. Sweat covering him, he 
tossed on the bed with a groan 
and was suddenly awake, star- 
ing into the darkness. 

He thought he saw something 
at the foot of the bed. He closed 
his eyes and shook his head and 
looked again. The room was 
empty. He felt mind -drenching 
thoughts recede like some alien 
fog. 

His fists contracted angrily. 
She's been at me while I slept, 
he thought. Goddam her hide, 

she's been at me. 

He pushed back the covers and 
crawled to the foot of the bed 
nervously. 

He couldn't see them, but the 
cloying fumes Undulated up from

the floor like erected serpents 
slithering into his nostrils. Gag- 
ging, he slumped down on the 
mattress, his stomach wrenched. 

Why? His brain mumbled over 
and over. My God, why? 

Angrily, he threw the flowers 
away in her sight and the 
thoughts pleaded and showered 
over him like raindrops, 

"I said no, didn't I?" he yelled 
at her. 

Then he sat down at the table 
and controlled himself as well as 
he could. I We got a long way to 
go, he told his will. Ease off, ease 
off. 

Now he was sure he knew why 
it was only six months; that 
would be more than enough. But 
I won't crack, . he commanded 
himself. It's a cinch she isn't go- 
ing to crack, so conserve your- 
self. She's too stupid to crack, he 
thought deliberately, hoping she'd 
pick it up. 

She apparently did, for her 
shoulders slumped dejectedly all 
at once. And, during breakfast, 
she circled him like a timorous 
wraith, keeping her face averted 
and her thoughts aloof. He found 
himself almost sorry for her then. 
It probably wasn't her fault. It 
was just an inborn trait among 
the Gnee women. 

Then he realized that her 
thoughts were at him again, ten- 
der and gratefully maudlin. He 
tried to neutralize himself and ig- 



nore them as they sought to break 
through his apathy like honeyed 
picks. 

All day he worked hard and 
made payments in spices and 
grain to the Gnee foreman. He 
wondered if the payments would 
go eventually to the women — 
wherever they were. 

"Tm taping my voice," he dic- 
tated later that night. "I want 
to hear myself talking so I c%n 
forget her. There's no one else 
here to talk to: I have to talk to 
myself. A sad case. Well, here 
goes. 

"Here I am on Station Four, 
folks, having a wonderful time 
and wish you were here instead 
of me. Oh, it's not that bad" 
Don't get me wrong. But I guess 
I know what knocked out Corri- 
gan and the poor bastards before 
him. It was Lover and her can- 
nibal mind eating them up. But 
I'll tell you .this, cousins; it's 
not going to eat me up. That 
much you can put bets on. Lover 
isn't going to . . . 

"No, I didn't call you! Come 
on, get out of my life, will you? 
Go to a movie or something. 
Yeah, yeah, I know. Well, go 
to bed then. Just leave me alone. 

Alone. 

"There. That for her. She'll 
have to go some to get me claw- 
ing at the wallpaper." 

But he carefully locked the 
door to his room when he went 



LOVER WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 



87 



to bed. And he groaned in his 
sleep because of the same night- 
mare and his limbs thrashed and 
all peace and rest were crowded 
out. 

He twisted into wakefulness in 
mid-morning and stumbled up 
to check the door. He fumbled at 
the lock with heavy fingers. 
Finally his thickened centers di- 
vined the fact that the door was 
still locked and he went back to 
bed in a weaving line and fell on 
it into a stupored sleep. 

When he woke up in the morn- 
ing, there were flowers at the foot 
of his bed, luxuriantly purple and 

foul-smelling. 

The door was still locked. 

TJE couldn't ask her about it 
-"■-"- because he left the kitchen 
in revulsion when she called him 
dear. 

No more flowers. I promise, 
cried her pursuing thoughts. He 
locked himself in the living room 
and sat at the desk, feeling sick. 
Get hold of yourself! he ordered 
his system, clasping his hands 
tightly and holding his teeth 
firmly clenched. 

Eat? She was outside the door; 
he knew it. 

He closed his eyes. Go away, 
leave me alone, he told her" 

I'm sony, dear, she said. 

"Stop calling me dear!" he 
ghouted, slamming his fist on the 
desk surface. As he twisted in the 



chair, his belt buckle caught on 
the drawer handle and it jerked 
out. He found himself staring 
down at the shiny gas pistol. Al- 
most unconsciously he reached 
down and touched its slick barrel. 

He shoved in the drawer with 
a convulsive movement. None of 
that! 

He looked around suddenly, 
feeling alone and free. He got up 
and hurried to the window. Down 
below, he saw her hurrying across 
the grounds with a basket on her 
arm. She's going for vegetables, 
he thought. But what made her 
leave so suddenly? 

Of course. The pistol. She must 
have gotten his thoughts of vio- 
lent intent. 

He sighed and calmed down a 
little. Vve still got cards in my 
hand, he soothed himself. 

While she was out, he decided 
to look in her room and see if 
he could find the shifting panel 
that enabled her to enter his room 
with the flowers. He hurried down 
the hall and pushed open the door 
to her barely furnished little 
chamber. 

His brain was immediately at- 
tacked by the odor of a reeking 
pile of the purple flowers in one 
corner. He held a hand over his 
mouth and nose as he looked 
down in distaste at the living and 
dead blossoms. 

What did they represent? An 

offering of thought fulness? His 



IB 




 



throat contracted. Or was it more 
than thoughtfulness? He grim- 
aced at the thought and remem- 
bered that first evening when he'd 
dubbed her Lover. What had pos- 
sessed him to choose that name 
from the infinity of possible 
names? He hoped he didn't know. 
He hoped he'd never know" 

On her couch he found a small 
pile of odds and ends. There 
was a button, a pair of broken 
shoe laces, the piece of crumpled 
paper he had told her to throw 
away. And a belt buckle with the 
initials W. C, stamped on it. 

There were no secret panels. 

He sat in the kitchen staring 
into an untouched cup of coffee" 
No way she could get in his 
room. W. C. — William Corrigan. 
He had to fight it, keep fight- 
ing it. 

Time passed. Suddenly he re- 
alized that she was back in the 
house again. There was no sound; 
it was like the return of a ghost. 
But he knew it. A cloud of feel- 
ing preceded her, came plunging 
through the rooms like an ex- 
cited puppy searching. Thoughts 
swirled. 

You are well? You are not 
angry? Lover is hack — all hastily 
and eagerly clutching at him. 

She swept into the room so 
quickly that his hands twitched 
and he upset the cup. The hot 
liquid splashed over his shirt and 
trousers as he jumped back. 



knocking over the chain 

She put down the basket and 
got a towel. He stood there, lips 
drained of color as she patted 
the stains dry. She'd never been 
so close to him. She'd never actu- 
ally touched him before except 
for that first revolting handshake. 

There was an aroma about her; 
it made his chest heave painfully. 
And all the time, her thoughts 
caressed his mind as her hands 
seemed to be caressing his body. 

There, there. I am here with 
you, David dear. 

Almost in horror, he stared at 
her spongy pink skin, her huge 
eyes, her tiny wound of a mouth. 

And, in the office that morning, 
he made three straight mistakes 
in the log book and tore out the 
whole page and hurled it across 
the room with a choking cry of 
rage. 

A VOID her. No point in argu- 
■""■ ing or threatening. He tried 
to raze his mental ground so that 
her thoughts could not find do- 
micile there. If he relaxed his 
mind enough, her thoughts flowed 
through and out, perhaps taking 
part of his will as they left, but 
he had to risk that. 

And if he worked hard and 
crowded his head with stodgy 
banks of figures, it kept her at a 
distance and his hands did not 
tremble so badly. 

Maybe I should sleep in the 



LOVER WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 



Z9 



office, he thought. 

Then he found Corrigan's note. 
It was on a slip of paper stuck 
away in the log book, hidden 
white on white. He only found it 
because he was going through the 
pages one at a time, reciting the 
dates in a loud voice to keep his 
mind filled. 

"God help me," read the note, 
black and jagged-lettered. "Lover 
comes through the walls!" 

Lindell stared. 

"I saw it myself/ 1 attested the 
words. "I'm going out of my 
mind. Always that damn animal 
mind tugging and tearing at me. 
And now I can't even shut away 
her body. I slept out here, but 
she came anyway." 

Lindell read it again and it was 
a wind fanning the fires of terror. 
Through the walls. The words 
agonized him. Was it possible? 

It was Corrigan, then, who had 
named her Lover. From the very 
start, the relationship had been 
on her terms. Lindell had had 
nothing to say about it. 

"Lover," he muttered, and her 
thoughts enveloped him suddenly 
like a bat's wings swooping down 
from the sky. He flung up his 
arms and cried out, "Leave me 
alone!" 

And, as her phantom mind 
slipped off, he had the sense that 
it was with less timidity, with 
the patience such as a man know- 
ing his own great strength can 



afford to display. i 

He sank back on the chair, ex" 
hausted suddenly, depleted with 
fighting it. He crumpled the note 
in his right hand, thinking of 
the scratches on the wall behind 
him. And he saw in his mind Cor- 
rigan tossing on the cot, burning 
with fever, rearing up with a 
shriek of horror to see her stand- 
ing before him. 

But then? The scene was dark. 

He rubbed a shaking hand over 
his face. Don't crack, he said to 
himself. But it was more a fright- 
ened entreaty than a command. 
Wasting fogs of premonition 
flooded over him in chilling 
waves. 

She comes through the walls. 

That night again, he poured 
down the bathroom sink the po- 
tion she had made. He locked the 
door and, in the lightless room, 
he squatted in one corner, peering 
and waiting, lungs bellowing only 
because he forced himself to re- 
member to breathe. 

The thermostat lowered the 
heat. The floorboards got icy and 
his teeth started chattering. I'm 
not going to bed, he vowed 
angrily. He didn't know why it 
was suddenly the bed that 
frightened him. / don't know, he 
forced the words through his 
brain, because he felt vaguely, 
that he did know and he didn't 
want to admit it, even for a 
second. 



But, after hours of futile wait- 
ing, he had to straighten up with 
m snapping of joints and stumble 
back to bed. There he crawled 
under the blankets and lay trem- 
bling, trying to stay awake. 

She'll come while I'm asleep, 
he thought. 

I mustn't Bleep. 

When he woke up in the morn- 
ing, there were flowers on the 
floor for him. And that was an- 
other day before a mass of days 
that sank crushed into the lump 
of months. 

1 kTOU can get used to horror," he thought, when it has lost 
immediacy and is no longer pun- 
gent and has become a steady 
diet. When it has degraded to a 
chain of mind-numbing events. 
When shocks are like scalpels 
picking and jabbing at delicate 
ganglia until they have lost all 
feeling. 

Yet, though it was no longer 
terror, it was worse. For his 
nerves were raw and bleeding a 
hemophilia of rage. He fought his 
battles to the dregs of seconds, 
gaunt-willed, shouting her off, 
firing lances of hate from his 
despairing mind, tortured by her 
surrenders that were her victories. 
She always came back; like an 
enraging cat, rubbing endless 
sycophantic sides against him, 
filling him with thoughts of . . . 
yes, admit it! he screamed 



to himself through midnight 
struggles. 

Thoughts of love. 

And there was the undercur- 
rent, the promise of new shock 
that would topple his already 
shaking edifice. It needed only 
that; an added push, another stab 
of the blade, one more drop of 
the shattering hammer. 

The shapeless threat hung over 
him. He waited for it, poised for 
it a hundred times an hour, es- 
pecially at night. Wait. Waiting, j 
And sometimes, when he thought I 
he knew what it was he was wait- 
ing for, the shock of admission 
made him shudder and made him 
want to claw at walls and break 
things and run until the blackness 
swallowed him. 

If he could only forget her 
for a while, just a little while, 
it would be all right. He mumbled 
it to himself as he set up the 
friovie projector. 

She begged from the kitchen, 
Can I see? 

"No!" 

Now all his replies, worded or 
thought, were like the snapping 
retorts of a jangled old man. If 
only the six months would end. 
That was the problem. The 
months were not moving fast 
enough. And time was like her — 
not to be reasoned with or in- 
timidated. 

There were many reels of film 
on the wall shelf, but his hand 
reached up without hesitation 
and picked out one. He didn't 
notice it; his mind was calloused 
to suggestion. He adjusted the 
reel on the spindle and turned out 
the lights. He sat down with a 
tired groan as the flickering milky 
light cone shot out from the lens, 
throwing pictures on the screen. 
A lean dark-bearded man was 
posing, arms crossed, white 
teeth showing in an artificial 
smile. He came closer to the 
camera. The sun flashed, blurring 
the film a second. Black screen. 
Title: "Picture of Me." 

The man, high-checkboned, 
bright-eyed, stood laughing 
soundlessly out from the screen. 
He pointed to his side and the 
capiera swung around. Lindell 
sat up sharply. 

It was the station. 

Apparently it was fall, for, as 
the camera swept past the house, 
the village, jerking a moment as 
though changing hands, he saw 
the trees surrounded by heaps of 
dead leaves. He sat there shiver- 
ing, waiting for something, he 
didn't know what. 

The screen blacked. Another 
title roughly etched in white. 
"Jeff in the Office." 

The man peered at the camera, 
an idiotic smile on his face. 
White skin accentuated by the 
immaculate black outline of his 
beard. 

Fadeout, in. The man doing a 



jig around the empty warehouse 
floor, hands poised delicately in 
the air, his dark hair bouncing 
wildly on his skull. 

Another title flashing on the 
screen. Lindell stiffened in his 
seat, his breath cut off abruptly. 

"Lover." 

ff^HERE was her face, horribly 
-■- repellent in black and white. 
She was standing by his bedroom 
window, her face a mask of de- 
light. He could tell it was de- 
light now. Once he would have 
said she looked like a maniac, 
her mouth twisted like a living 
scar, her grotesque eyes staring. 

She spun and her robe swirled 
out. He saw her puffy ankles and 
his stomach muscles grew rock 
taut. 

She approached the camera. 
He saw filmy eyelids slide down 
over her eyes. His hands began 
to tremble violently. It was his 
dream. It made him sick. It was 
his dream to the detail. Then it 
had never been a dream; not from 
his own mind. 

A sob tore at his throat. She 
was undoing the robe. Here it is! 
gibbered his mind in a panic. 
He whimpered and reached out 
shakily to turn off the projector. 

No! It was a cold command in 
the darkness. Watch me, she or- 
dered. 

He sat bound in a vise of ter- 
ror, staring in sick fascination as 
the robe slid from her neck, pulled 
down over her round shoulders. 
She twisted sensuously. The robe 
sank into a heavy swirling heap 
on the floor. 

He screamed, flung out an arm 
that swept into the burning pro- 
jector. It crashed down on the 
floor. The room was night. He 
struggled up and lurched across 

the room. 

Nice? Nice? The word dug at 
him mercilessly as he fumbled 
for the door. 

He found it, rushed into the 
hall. Her door opened and she 
stood in the half light, the robe 
hanging from one spongy shoul- 
der. 

He jolted to a halt. "Get out of 
here!" he yelled. 

No. 

He made a convulsive move for 
her, hands out like rigid claws. 
The sight of her pink, moist flesh 
spun him away. 

Yes? her mind suggested. It 
seemed as if he heard it spoken 
in a sly rising voice. 

"Listen!'" he cried, reaching out 
for the door to his room. "Listen, 
you have to go, do you under- 
stand? Go to your mate/" 

He twisted back in utter horror. 

I am with him now, her mes- 
sage had said. 

The thought paralyzed him. He 
stared, open-mouthed, heart 
pounding in slow, gigantic beats 
as the robe slipped over her 



shoulders and started down her 
arms. 

He whirled with a cry and 
slammed the door behind him. 
His fingers shook on the lock. 
Her thoughts were a wailing in 
his mind. He shook in fright and 
sickness and knew it was no good 
because he couldn't lock her out. 

TT"HERE were monkeys chatter - 
-" ing in his brain. They lay on 
their backs in a circle and kicked 
at the inside of his skull. They 
grabbed juicy blobs of gray in 
their dirty paws and they 
squeezed. 

He rolled on his side with a 
groan, Vll go crazy, he said. Like 
Corrigan, tike all of them but the 
first one — that slimy one who 
started it all; who added % new 
and hideous warp to the corru- 
gation of her dominating mind-— 
who had named her Lover be- 
cause he meant it. 

Suddenly he sat up with a gasp 
of terror, staring at the foot of 
the bed. She comes through the 
walls, howled his brain. Nothing 
there, his eyes saw. His fingers 
clutched at the sheets. He felt 
sweat dripping off his brow and 
rolling down the embankment of 
his nose. 

He lay back. Up again! He 
whimpered like a frightened child, 
A cloud of blackness was falling 
over him. He groaned, "No/ in 
the blackness. 

No use. 

He whined. Sleep. Sleep. The 
word throbbed, swelled and de- 
pressed in his brain. This was 
the time. He knew it, knew it f 
knew . . . 

The blade falling, sanity de- 
capitated and twitching bloody in 
the basket. 

No! 

He tried to push himself up, 
but he couldn't. Sleep. A black 
tide of night hovering, tracking. 
Sleep. 

He fell on the pillow, pushed 
up weakly on one elbow. 

"No." His lungs were crusted. 
"No." 

He struggled. It was too much- 
He screamed a thick bubbling 
scream. She threw his will aside, 
snapped and futile. She was using 
all her strength now and he was 
de-enervated, beaten. He thudded 
back on the pillow, glassy-eyed 
and limp. He moaned weakly and 
his eyes shut, opened, shut, 
opened, shut . . . 

The dream again. Insane. Not 

a dream. 

When he woke up, there were 
no flowers. The courtship was 
ended. He gaped blankly and un- 
believingly at the imprint of a 
body beside him on the bed. 

It was still warm and moist. 

HE laughed out loud. He wrote 
curse words in his diary. He 
wrote them in tall black letters, 



holding the pencil like a knife. 
He wrote them in the log book 
too, He tore up vouchers if they 
were not the right color. His 

entries were crooked, lines of fig" 
ures like wavy-numbered tendrils. 
Sometimes he didn't care about 
that. Mostly he didn't notice. 

He prowled the filled ware- 
house behind locked doors, red- 
eyed and muttering. He clamb- 
ered up on the bundles and stared 
out through the skylight at the 
empty sky, He was lighter by 
fifteen pounds, unwashed- His 
face was black with wiry growth. 
He was going to have an immacu- 
late beard. She wanted it. She 
didn't want him to wash or shave 
or be healthy. She called him 
Jeff dear. 

You can't fight that, he told 
himself, You can't win because 
yQM lose. // you advance you 
are retreating because, when you 
are too tired to fight, she comes 
back and she takes your bodjr 
and your souL 

That was why he whispered to 
the warehouse so no one would 
hear, "There is a thing to do." 

And that was why, at night, he 
sneaked to the living room and 
put the gas pistol in his pocket. 
Never harm the Gnees. Well, that 
was wrong. It was kill or be 
killed. " 

That's why I'm taking the 
pistol to bed with me. That's why 
I'm stroking it as I stare up at 
the ceiling. Yes, this is it. This is 
my rock to rest on through the 
day -nights. 

And he turned over plans as 
an animal snuffles over flat stones 
to find bugs for supper. 

Days. Days. Days. 

He whispered, "Kill her/" 

He nodded and smiled to him- 
self and patted the cool metal. 

"You're my friend." he said, 
"You're my only friend. She has 
to die. We all know that." 

He made lots of plans and they 
were all the same one. He killed 
her a million times in his mind, 
in secret chambers of his mind 
that he had discovered and 
opened; where he could crouch 
clever and undisturbed while he 
mack his plans. 

He walked and looked at the 
worker's village. 

Animals. Frn not going to end 
Up like you. Vm not going to 
I'm not going to and when I do 
I'm not I am

TINDELL lurched up from his 
office desk, eyes wide, slaver 
jrunning over his lips. He held the 
pistol tight in his palsied hand. 
He flung open the office door 
and staggered over the concrete, 
through the lanes between roof- 
high stacks. His mouth was so 
tight that his clamped jaws hurt. 
He held the pistol pointing- 
He kicked up the catch and 
dragged back one heavy door" He 
plunged out into the hot sun- 
light and broke into a run. Wisps 
of terror licked out from the 
house. He thought of murder with 
harder, more savage joy. He ran 
faster. He fell down because his 
legs had no feeling. The pistol 
went flying. He crawled to it and 
tenderly brushed off the dust. 

He stood up dizzily and started 
to hobble. He was hearing things 
— not Lover's thoughts, for once. 

He looked up and blinked and 
knew he was going insane . . • 

It was a cargo ship. The cargo 
ship. Only, of course, it couldn't 
be. 

He dropped the pistol and 
slumped down beside it, plucking 
at blue grass with an idiot in- 
tensity that he knew was like 
the Gnee men's. He was careful 
not to watch the ship as it seemed 
to come down and the hatches 
made an impossibly convincing 
clang and men appeared to climb 
out. 

"Go away," he said to the illu- 
sion of a man standing beside 
him. "You f re not here. The six 
months aren't over." 

His voice was quite normal, ex- 
cept that it broke into giggles 
and sobs while he had a fist fight 
with the air. 

"You'll be all right," the man 
apparently said, and he felt some- 
thing that might have been an 
insect bite, though he thought it 
was the man pricking him with a 
hypo of sedative. 

Two other men came with a 
stretcher and a sheet that they 
wrapped him tightly in, and they 
began carrying him, shrieking and 
battling, toward the mirage ship. 

"You can't take me away!" 
he shouted, "I've got to kill 
Lover first!"" 

"It wouldn't do any good." the 
first man said. "There are a lot 
more where she came from — 
one at a time for every guy we 
station here, it looks like." 

"She comes through the walls!" 
Lindell screamed. 

"That's what you get to be- 
lieve," said the man soothingly. 
"It must be pretty fierce. But 



that's all over now. You're going 
back home." 

Lindell tried to fight free of 
the sheet. "Let me at least warn 
the next guy!" 

"It wouldn't do any good. He 
wouldn't believe you. That's why 
you didn't see us take away the 
poor character you relieved." 

And then the sedative took hold 
and Lindell fell asleep. The 
dreams came, but with them was 
the sound of rockets blasting off, 
and the spongy image of the Gnee 
woman grew smaller and smaller
