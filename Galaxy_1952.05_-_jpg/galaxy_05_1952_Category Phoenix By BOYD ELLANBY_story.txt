THE door-knob turned, then 
rattled. 
Dr. David Wong stepped 
out from behind the large book- 
case, listening. He pressed the 
brass handle of the top shelf and 
the case silently pivoted back to 
become part of the wall, obliter- 
ating the dark passage behind it. 
An imperative knockirig began 
at the door; David walked softly 
to his desk and picked up his 
notebook. He tried to remain re- 
laxed, but he could feel the tight- 
ening of his shoulder muscles. 
With his right hand, he shut his 
notebook and concealed it under 
a mass of papers, while his left 
hand pressed the desk button to 



release the lock of the door. 

The door burst open and two 
men strode in, a black-uniformed 
Ruler followed by a watchguard. 
Black -visored cap still on his 
head, the first man marched to 
the desk and spoke without cere- 
monial greeting. 

"The door was locked, Dr. 
Wong?" 

"Correct, Dr. Lanza. The door 
was locked/* 

"I shall have to instruct the 
guard to report it. Have you for- 
gotten Leader Marley's Maxim : 
Constructive science does not 
skulk behind locked doors?" 

Wong leaned back in his chair 
and smiled at his visitors.

"The wisdom of Leader Marley 
is a constant help to us all, but 
his generosity is also a byword. 
Surely you remember that on the 
tenth anniversary of his acces- 
sion, he honored me by the grant 
of occasional hours of Privacy, 
as a reward for my work on Blue 
Martian Fever?" 

*'I remember now," said Dr. 
Lanza. 

"But what for?" asked Officer 
Blagun. "It's anti-social!" 

"Evidently you have forgotten, 
Officer Blagun, another Maxim 
of Leader Marley: Nature has 
not equipped one Category to 
judge the needs of another; only 
the Leader understands all. Now, 
Dr. Lanza, will you tell me the 
reason for this visit? Since your 
promotion from Research to 
Ruler, I have rarely been honored 
by your attention." 

"I am here with a message," 
said Lanza. "Leader Marley's 
compliments, and he requests 
your presence at a conference on 
next Wednesday at ten in the 
morning." 

"Why did you have to deliver 
that in person? What's wrong 
with using Communications?" 

"It's not my province to ask 
questions, Dr. Wong. I was told 
to come here, and I was told to 
wait for a reply." 

"Next Wednesday at ten? Let's 
see, this is Friday." David Wong 
pressed the key of his electronic 



calendar, but he had no need to 
study the dull green and red 
lights that flashed on to indicate 
the pattern of his day. He did 
not delude himself that he had 
any real choice, but he had 
learned in the past fifteen years 
that it kept up his courage to 
preserve at least the forms of in- 
dependence. He allowed a decent 
thirty seconds to ponder the 
coded lights, then blanked the 
board and looked up with an easy 
smile. 

"Dr. Wong's compliments to 
Leader Marley, and he will be 
honored to attend a conference 
on Wednesday at ten." 

Nodding his head, Dr. Lanza 

glanced briefly around the office. 
"Queer, old-fashioned place you 
have here." 

"Yes. It was built many years 
ago by a slippery old politician 
who wanted to be safe from his 
enemies. Makes a good place for 
Research, don't you think?" 

Lanza did not answer. He 
strode to the door, then paused 
to look back. 

"You understand, Dr. Wong, 
that I shall have to report the 
locked door? I have no choice,** 

"Has anyone?" 

Officer Blagun followed his 
superior, leaving the door wide 
open behind them. Wong re- 
mained rigid in his chair until 
the clack of heels on marble floor 
bad become a mere echo in his

brain, then stretched out his hand 
to the intercom. He observed with 
pride that his hand did not trem- 
ble as he pressed the dial. 

"Get me Dr. Karl Haslam . . . 
Karl? Can you meet me in the 
lab right away? I've thought of 
a new approach that might help 
us crack the White Martian prob- 
lem. Yes, I know we planned on 
conferring tomorrow, but it's get- 
ting later than you* think." 

Again he pressed the dial. "Get 
me Leah Hachovnik. Leah? I've 
got some new stuff to dictate. Be 
a good girl and come along right 
away. ,f 

Breaking the connection, he 
diew out his notebook and 
opened it. 
*David Wong was a big man, 
tall, well-muscled, compact, and 
he might have been handsome 
but for a vague something in his 
appearance. His lean face and 
upcurving mouth were those of 
a young man; his hair was a 
glossy black, too thick to be dis- 
ciplined into neatness; and he 
was well-dressed, except for the 
unfashionable bulging of his 
jacket pocket, where he carried 
a bulky leather case of everfeed 
pens and notebooks. But it was 
his eyes that were disconcerting 
— an intense blue, brilliant and 
direct, they had a wisdom and a 
comprehension that seemed in- 
congruous in so young a face. 

A worried frown creased his 



forehead as he turned back to one 
of the first pages, studying the 
symbols he had recorded there, 
but he looked up without expres- 
sion on hearing the tapping of 
slender heels. 

"Quick work, Leah. How are 
you this morning?" 

"As if anybody cared!" Leah 
Hachovnik settled down before 
the compact stenograph machine, 
her shoulders slumped, her thin 
mouth drooping at the corners. 

"Feel like working?" said 
David. 

"As much as I ever do, I guess. 
Sometimes I wonder if the trai- 
tors in the granite quarries have 
it any worse than I do. Some- 
times I wish Fd been born into 
some other Category. Other peo- 
ple have all the luck, I don't 
know what it is, Dr. Wong, but I 
just don't seem to have the pep 
I used to have. Do you think it 
could be the climate here in New 
York?" 

"People do grow older, Leah," 
he reminded her gently. 

"I know. But Tanya — you re- 
member my twin sister Tanya, 
the one that got so sick that time, 
ten years ago, when you did that 
experiment with Blue Martian 
Fever, and she had to be sent out 
to Arizona? Of course I haven't 
ever seen her since then — people 
in Office Category never get per- 
mission for that kind of travel- 
but she writes me that ever since 




 



she got well again she feels just 
like a kid, and works as hard as 
she ever did, and she still seems 
to enjoy life. Why, she's had three 
proposals of marriage this past 
year alone, she says, and yet she's 
thirty-five, just the same age as I 
am — being twins, you know? — 
arifi nobody's proposed to me in 
ages. Well, I'm certainly going 
to try to find out what her 
method is. She's coming back 
tomorrow/* 

"She's what?" 

"Coming back. BureauMed is 
sending her back here to the In- 
stitute to take up her old job in 
Intercom. Funny they haven't 
told you, her being an old em- 
ployee and all." 

Dr. Wong was gripping his 
notebook iiy stiff fingers, but he 
replied easily, "Oh, well, Bureau- 
Med is a complex organization. 
With all they have to do, it's not 
surprising they get things mixed 
up sometimes." 

"Don't I know!" she sighed, 
and droned on in a dreary mono- 
tone. "This one institute alone 
would turn your hair gray before 
your time. I don't know how 
some people seem to keep so 
young. I was just 'thinking to 
myself this morning when I 
watched you walking through the 
office, 'Why, Dr. Wong doesn't 
seem to age a bit! He looks just 
as young as he ever did, and look 
at me!'" 



Looking at her, David admit- 
ted to himself, was not the pleas- 
ure it had once been. Ten years 
ago, she and her twin sister 
Tanya had been plump, delecta- 
ble, kittenish girls, their mental 
equipment no more than standard 
for Office Category, of course, 
but their physical appearance had 
been outstanding, almost beauti- 
ful enough for Theater Category, 
Creamy ivory skin, gray eyes, 
and soft red hair dramatized by 
a freakish streak of white that 
shot abruptly back from the cen- 
ter of the forehead, Tanya's 
swirling to the left, and Leah's to 
the right, one girl the mirror im- 
age of the other. 

But the Leah sitting before him 
now was thin and tired-looking, 
her sallow skin was lined, and 
her soft voice had become vine- 
gary with disappointments. Her 
red hair had faded to a common- 
place brown, and the white streak 
in the center was yellowed. An 
unwanted, souring old maid. But 
there was only one response to 
make. 

"You look fine to me, Leah," 
he said. "What time did you say 
your sister is coming?" 

"Tomorrow evenings' Play* 
ground Jet. Why?" 

"We'll have to think of a way 

to celebrate. But right now. I'd 
like to get started on my new 
paper. I've got to meet Dr. Has- 
m before long."

"I know." She raised her faded 
gray eyes. "That was a funny 
thinjj you said to him just now 
over the intercom. You said to 
him it was getting late. But it 
isn't late. It's only eleven o'clock 
in the morning." 

David stared. "Do you mean 
to say you were listening to our 
conversation? Why did you do 
that?" 

She fidgeted and turned away 
from him. "Oh, I just happened 
to be at Comdesk and I guess 
the circuit wasn't closed. Does it 
matter? But it seemed a funny 
thing for you to say/ 1 

"People in Office Category are 
not supposed to understand Re- 
search/' he said severely. "If they 
were capable of Research* Leader 
B/fSrley's planners would have 
placed them there. As for its be- 
ing late, it is, as far as White 
Martian Fever is concerned. 
Which is the subject of my paper. 
Prepare to take dictation/' 

Shrugging her shoulders, she 
poised her bony fingers over the 
keys of the little machine. 

"Paper for delivery at the Sum- 
mer Seminar," he began* 

"But, Dr. Wong, that doesn't 
have to be ready for three months 
yet!" 

"Miss Hachovnik! Please re- 
member Leader Marley's Maxim : 
Individuals born into Office Cate- 
gory are the bone and muscle of

them to act, not to think/' 

! Yes, Dr. Wong. I'm sorry." 
Don't worry, Leah. We're old 
friends, so I won't report you. 
All set?" 

He took a pencil from his 
leather case and tapped it against 
his notebook as he ruffled the 
pages, wondering how to begin. 
It was hard to think logically 
when a part of his mind was in 
such confusion. Had Leah been 
listening in to all of his phone 
conversations? If so, it was for- 
tunate that he had long ago de- 
vised an emergency code. Was it 
only idle curiosity that had 
prompted her or was she acting 
under orders? Was anyone else 
watching him, he wondered, 
listening to his talk, perhaps even 
checking the routine of his ex- 
perimental work? There was 
Lanza this morning — why had he 
come unannounced, in person, 
when a Communications call 
would have served the purpose 
equally well? 

Leah's voice broke in. u I*m 
ready, Dr. Wong/' 

He cleared his throat. ". . . the 
Summer Seminar. Title: The 
Propogation of White Martian 
virus. Paragraph. It will be re- 
membered that the early at- 
tempts to establish Earth colonies 
on Mars were frustrated by the 
extreme susceptibility of our peo- 
ple to two viruses native to the 
foreign planet, viruses which we 









t 




 



designate as Blue Martian and 
White Martian, according to the 
two distinct types of fever which 
they cause. Blue Martian Fever 
in the early days caused a mor- 
tality among our colonists of 
nearly eighty-five per cent, and 
made the establishment of per- 
manent colonies a virtual impos- 
sibility. 

"Under the inspired leadership 
of Leader Marley and with the 
advice of his deputy Dr. Lanza, 
this laboratory in Research 
worked out a method of growing 
the virus and producing an im- 
munizing agent which is effective 
in nearly all human beings. Only 
the cooperation of several Cate- 
gories made possible such a feat. 
It will not be forgotten that even 
the humblest helpers in the In- 
stitute had their share in the 
project, that some of them acted 
as human volunteers in the ex- 
periments, well knowing the risks 
they ran, and were afterward re- 
warded by a Free Choice, 

"One person in Office Category, 
for instance, was given the privi- 
lege of learning to play the flute, 
although nobody in his family 
had ever belonged to Music, and 
another person in Menial Cate- 
gory was permitted a month's 
study of elementary algebra, a 
nearly unheard of indulgence for 
a person in his position. But as 
Leader Marley so graciously re- 
marked in conferring the awards: 



To the individual who risks 
much, the State gives much." 

"Like me and Tanya?" the 
girl asked, stopping her typing. 

"Yes, like you and Tanya. You 
were allowed to act a part in an 
amateur Theater group, I re- 
member, and since Tanya was 
made too ill to be able to use a 
Free Choice, she was sent out 
west to the Playground, just as 
though she had belonged to Ruler 
Category. Now where was I?" 

41 'The State gives much/ " 

"Oh, yes. Paragraph. Since the 
discovery of the immunizing 
mechanism to Blue Martian, per- 
manent colonies have been estab- 
lished on Mars. But there remains 
the more elusive problem of 
White Martian Fever, which, 
though its mortality is only thirty 
per cent, is still so crippling to 
those victims who survive that 
the Martian colonies cannot be- 
gin to expand, and the resources 
of the planet cannot be fully 
developed, until an immunizing 
agent is found. 

"For the past eight years this 
laboratory has been working at 
the problem, among others, and 
we are now in a position to report 
a small degree of progress. Since 
it proved to be impossible to 
grow the virus in the usual media, 
it occurred to us — " 

The intercom buzzed, and Dr» 
Wong turned away to open the 
dial.

"David? What's happened to 
you? I've been waiting here in 
the lab a quarter of an hour." 

"Sorry, Karl. I thought I had 
more time. Be right down." 

He reached for his white lab 
coat and shoved his long arms 
into the starched sleeves. "That's 
all we have time for now, Leah. 
Can you get an early lunch and 
be back here this afternoon at 
two?" 

But she was- not listening. She 
was leaning over to look at the 
desk, staring avidly at the open 
pages of Dr. Wong's notebook. 
Without comment he picked up 
the book, closed it, put it in the 
top drawer and locked the drawer. 
She watched him with curious 
eyes, 

**What funny marks those were, 
Dr. Wong! Do you keep your 
notes in a private system of short- 
hand?" 

"No. I write them in Coptic. 
For the sake of privacy." 

"What's Coptic?" 

"A dead language, spoken by 
the ancient Egyptians thirty or 
forty centuries ago." 

"But you're Research, not Lin- 
guistics! It's against the law for 
you to know other languages. 
Are you a traitor?" 

"My dear Leah," he said, "I'm 
far too sensible a man to go in 
for bootleg study, to learn any- 
thing without permission. I have 
no wish to end up with a pick-ax 



in my hands. But you shouldn't 
tax your little mind with think- 
ing. It's not your job. You're not 
equipped for it, and it's danger- 



ous.

DAVID passed the watchguard 
stationed in the basement 
corridor, walked through the 
open door of the laboratory, past 
the bench where a row of pretty 
technicians sat making serial dilu- 
tions of bacterial and virus sus- 
pensions, through the glow of the 
sterilizing room, and on into the 
small inner 4ab where flasks of 
culture media and developing 
hens* eggs sat in a transparent in- 
cubator, and petri dishes flecked 
with spots of color awaited his 
inspection. 

Dr. Karl Haslam was standing 
at the work bench, with a pair 
of silver forceps which held a 
small egg under the psi light. 
Gently he lowered the egg into 
its warm observation chamber, 
covered the container, and sat 
down. 

"Well, here I am. What'.s gone 
wrong? Explain yourself, my 
boy." 

"Just a minute." Grinning ma- 
liciously, David took down a bot- 
tle from the shelf of chemicals, 
poured a colorless liquid into a 
beaker, and walked casually to- 
ward the doorway as he agitated 
the mixture of hydrogen sulphide 
and mercaptans. He held his 



10 




 



breath, then coughed, when the 
fumes of putrescence filled the 
room and drifted out the door. 
He looked into the technician's 



room. 



Sorry for the aroma, girls, but 
this is a vital experiment," 

"Can't you at least shut the 
door?" one called pleadingly. 

"Explain to the watchguard out 
there, will you?" Closing the 
door, he turned on the ventilator 
and sat down beside Dr. Haslam. 

"Why all the melodrama?" 
Karl asked, baffled, "First you 
call me by emergency code, then 
you hole in like a conspirator. 
I'm beginning to think you're a 
great loss to Theater, What's hap- 
pened? Why is it later than I 
think?" 

"Do you take everything as a 
joke, Karl?" 

"Certainly, until I'm forced to 
do otherwise. What's worrying 
you?" 

"I'm afraid of being arrested 
for treason. Don't laugh! This 
morning I received a message, 
delivered in person by our old 
schoolmate Lanza, to report to 
Leader Marley on Wednesday, 
and Marley hasn't paid any at- 
tention to me since he last in- 
spected our lab, years ago. For 
another thing, Leah Hachovnik is 
making a nuisance of herself with 
her curiosity about my affairs. If 
she weren't so clumsy about her 
prying, I'd almost believe she was 



under orders to spy on me." 

Karl moved impatiently, "I 
hope you're not turning psy- 
chotic. You have a clean record 
of continuous production and 
you've never mixed in politics* 
You've -never expressed what you 
may really think of our Leader 
even to me, although we've been 
friends since we were in Med- 
school, and I hope you never will. 
And you're making progress with 
White Martian. Why, my boy, 
you're all set! What's treasonable 
about that?" 

Someone knocked at the door. 
Hastily David uncovered the 
fragrant beaker and waved it 
about as he called, "Come in!" 

The watchguard looked in for 
an instant, wrinkled his nose, and 
quickly shut the door. Laughing, 
David covered the beaker, and 
began walking about with long 
nervous strides, snapping his 
fingers as be tried to explain. 

"I'm in trouble, Karl. I've run 
into something I don't know how 
to deal with, and I need help, I 
need advice, I need cooperation, 
I've lived alone with this thing 
for ten long years, hoping month 
after month that something 
would turn up so I could evade 
the issue. But nothing has. And 
now there's going to be a show- 
down." 

Karl touched his arm sympa- 
thetically. "My dear boy — " 

"That's it!" shouted David.

"What's what?" 

"That's what I'm trying to tell 
you. Why do you always call me 
your 'dear boy?* You know I'm 
a year older than you are/* 

"It's just habit, I suppose. You 
look so young — your hair is 
black, while mine is nearly white. 
You're full of vigor, while I be- 
gin to creak with middle age, I 
didn't realize that I irritated you 
with my little phrase. I should 
think you'd be pleased that you 
have somehow managed to sip at 
the fountain of youth/* 

David sank down on a stool. 
"I'm not pleased. I'm terrified/ 1 

"What do you mean?" 

"I mean that's exactly what's 
happened. I have sipped at the 
fountain of youth. I've discov- 
ered how to keep people from 
growing old, I myself have not 
aged a bit in the last ten years/' 

There was a long silence. Karl 
sat unmoving, his face like stone. 

"I don't believe you/* he said 
at last. 

"It's no longer a question of 
belief. In a few days everybody 
will know, the proof will stare 
you in the face. And what will 
happen then?'* 

"Evidence?" Karl asked. "I 
can't accept a statement as a 
fact/* 

"Would you like to sec my 
mice? Come with me.'* 

David Wong hurried into the 
small animal room and paused 



before a stack of wire cages in 
which furry creatures darted and 
squeaked. 

"You remember when we were 
working on Blue Martian, those 
peculiar mutants we found in our 
mice, and how I used six of them 
in trying to make antibodies to 
the virus?'\ 

"I remember/' said Karl, 
"They were spotted with tufts 
of white hair on the right fore- 
legs/' 

David took down a cage, thrust 
in his hand, and brought out two 
of the tiny black mice which 
crawled over his trembling hand, 
Their right forelegs bore tufts of 
long white hair. 

"These/* he said, "are the same 

mice/* 

"Their descendants, you mean. 
Mice don't live that long/' 

"These mice do. And they'll 
go on living. For years I've lived 
in fear that someone would notice 
and suspect the truth. Just as for 
years, every time someone has 
laughed and told me I never 
seemed to age a day, I've been 
terrified that he might guess the 
truth. I'm not aging/' 

Karl looked dazed. "Well, my 
boy, you've got a bear by the 
tail- How did you find the elixir 
or whatever it is?" 

"You remember the early work 
with radioactive tracers, a couple 
of hundred years ago, that proved 
that all our body cells are in a 



12 




 



continuous state of flux? There's 
a dynamic equilibrium between 
the disintegration and the resyn- 
th< l of the essential factors such 
as proteins* fats and amino 
groups, but the cell directs all 
the incoming material into the 
right chemical structures, under 
the influence of some organizing 
power which resides in the cell. 

"Foreign influences like viruses 
may disrupt this order and cause 
cancer. The cells are continu- 
ally in a state of change, but al- 
ways replace their characteristic 
molecules, and it is only as they 
grow older that they gradually 
become 'worn out/ Then the body 
grows old, becomes less resistant 
to infection, and eventually suc- 
cumbs to one disease or another. 
And you know, of course, that 
viruses also have this self-dupli- 
cating ability. 

"I reasoned that at birth a 
man had a definite, finite amount 
of this essential self-duplicating 
entity — SDE — in his body cells, 
.a kind of directing factor which 
reproduces itself, but more slowly 
than do the body cells. In that 
case, with the normal multipli- 
cation of the cells, the amount of 
SDE per cell would slowly but 
surely grow smaller with the 
years. Eventually the time would 
come when the percentage would 
be below the critical level — the 
cells would be less resistant, 
would function with less effi- 



ciency, and the man would 'grow 
old/ " 

Karl nodded soberly. "Reason- 
able hypothesis/* 

"But one day, by pure chance, 
I isolated a component which I 
recognized as being the factor es- 
sential to the normal functioning 
of body cells. It hit me like a 
toothache. I found that I could 
synthesize the SDE in the lab, 
and the only problem then was 
to get it into a man's cells. If I 
could do that, keep the SDE level 
up to that of youth, a man would 
stop aging! Since viruses pene- 
trate our cells when they infect 
us, it was no trick at all to effect 
a chemical coupling of the SDE 
to the virus. I used Martian Blue, 
since it was handy, and its effects 
are usually brief. 

"Presto! Old age is held at bay 
for another twenty or thirty years 
— I really don't know how long. 
These mice were my first experi- 
ment, and as you see, they're still 
alive. Next, I tried it on myself." 

David put the mice back in 
their cage, locked it, and returned 
to the lab. 

"Tomorrow, the whole thing is 
bound to come out because 
Tanya Hachovnik is coming 
back. You know her sister Leah 
— gray, dried- up, soured on life. 
Well, I've had ways of checking, 
and when Tanya Hachovnik 
walks into the Institute, everyone 
will see her as the same luscious

redhead of twenty-five we knew 
ten years ago, I realize that what 
I did was a criminal act. I didn't 
think the thing through or I 
wouldn't have been such a fool. 
But when I made those final ex- 
periments, I used the Hachovnik 
twins for a controlled pair.** 
"You must have been crazy!" 



* "Perhaps I was. I'd tried it on 
myself, of course, with no bad 
effects except a few days' fever, 
but I realized that without a con- 
trol I never could be sure the 
SDE was actually working. It 
might be just that my particular 
genetic constitution caused me to 
age more slowly than the average.

So I chose the twins. To Leah I 

gave the attenuated Martian 
Blue, but to Tanya I gave the 
simple Blue coupled with SDE. 
The experiment worked. Identi- 
cal twins — one grows old like 
other people; the other remains 
young. I know now, Karl, how to 
prolong youth indefinitely. But 
what in the name of Leader Mar- 
ley shall I do with my knowl- 
edge?" 

Karl Haslam absently twisted 
his white hair and spoke slowly, 
as though he found trouble in 
choosing his words. 

"You realize, of course, that it 
is your duty to acquaint Leader 
M arley with all the details of 
your discovery?" 

"Is it? Can you imagine what 
this will do to our society? What 
about the generations of children 
coming into a world where no 
places have been vacated for them 
by death? What about the strug- 
gles for power? Who will decide, 
and on what basis, whether to 
confer or to withhold this gift? 
There'll be riots, civil wars. I 
know that I'm only a scientist; 
all I ever wanted from life was 
to be left alone, in a peaceful 
laboratory, and let other people 
worry about the world and its 
troubles. But now — don't you see 
that by the mere fafct that I made 
this discovery, I've lost the right 
to sit by quietly and let other 
people make the decisions?" 



"But, David, you and I aren't 
able to handle such a problem! 
We're only Research!" 

"I know. We're inadequate, yet 
we have the responsibility. The 
men who created atomic power 
probably felt inadequate, too, but 
could they have made as bad a 
mess of handling it as others did? 
Suppose I did turn this over to 
Marley — he'd use it to become 
the most absolute tyrant in the 
history of the race." 

Karl ran his fingers through 
his hair and smiled crookedly. 
"Well, you could always start a 
revolution, I suppose, and start 
by assassinating the Leader." 

"With what kind of weapon? 
Men like you and me are not al- 
lowed to own so much as an old- 
fashioned pistol. Except for the 
Military, Marley's the only man 
allowed to wear a Needier. And, 
besides, I'm a Research, not a 
Military. I hate violence and I'm 
naturally conditioned against kill- 
ing." 

"Then you shouldn't have got 
into this mess. It would have been 
far better never to have discov- 
ered this SDE- I presume your 
notes are safely locked up, by the 
way?" 

David grinned. "Don't worry 
about my notes; they're written 
in Coptic. You remember when I 
was still in Medschobl and made 
my first important discovery, how 
to prevent the development of

hereditary baldness by the injec- 
tion of certain parahormones? 
Leader Marley rewarded me with 
a Free Choice, and I chose to 
learn a dead language. Not half 
a dozen men in the world could 
read my notes," 

"If your notes are safe, why 
don't you just destroy your mice 
and get rid of your proof that 
way?" 

"And the Hachovnik twins?" 

"You could at least keep Tanya 
out of sight." 

"Don't be a fool. That would 
only be a temporary measure and 
has nothing to do with the real 
problem, Lanza and Marley may 
suspect the truth right now, for 
all I know; they keep such close 
watch on my work. Anyway, the 
secret is bound to come out sooner 
or later." 

Dr. Haslam clasped his hands 
and stared at them for a long 
while. His lined face looked 
grayer than ever. 

He looked up at last with a 
faint smile. "Well, my boy, I 
never asked you to discover this 
stuff, but since you have — I 
hereby burn my bridges! You're 
right, we can't give it to Marley. 
But you can't handle it alone. 
What we need is time, and we 
haven't got it. We shall both be 
liquidated before this is over, 
there's no doubt of that, but we 
must do what we can. When is 
Tanya arriving?" 



"Tomorrow night, on the Play- 
ground Jet.'* 

"And you see Leader Marley 
when?" 

"Next Wednesday." 

"Five days yet. Then this is 
what we'll do. Too bad Lanza is 
in the other camp, but there's 

you and me, and I think Hudson 
and Faure from Serology will 
come in with us. We'll need others 
— sociologists, anthropologists, 
psychologists — the most promis- 
ing material from all Categories 
if we're to create a new society 
based on the prospect of im- 
mortality. But I'll see the first 
two and bring them to your 
apartment tomorrow night for 
Tanya's welcome-home party. I 
leave it to you to muzzle Leah." 

"That won't do," said David. 
"I 'don't have a current Free 
Choice/' 

"But I have. Two, as a matter 
of fact, a reward for curing the 
insomnia of Leader Marley's 
wife. I choose to give a party, I 
choose tomorrow night, and I 
choose your apartment." 

A knock rattled the door, and % 
the watchguard thrust in his 
head. "How much longer is this 
here experiment going to take? 
Do you guys N want to be re* 
ported?" 

"Just finishing, Officer/' called 
Karl. "You can leave the door

open now, 

"What a stink!" said the guard.

"Thank God I'm in Military! 



I 



T hardly seemed like a party, 

David thought. His guests 
were ill at ease, and their con- 
versation labored, then stopped 
altogether when the Menial came 
into the library with a tray of 
glasses and niblets. 

"Put them on the liquor cab- 
inet, James/ 1 said David. "And 
that will be all. Enjoy yourself 
tonight." 

The Menial put down the tray 
and then stooped to fumble with 
the lock. 

"Let that alone! I've told you 
a thousand times not to monkey 
with my liquor cabinet!" 

"Don't you want me to get out 
the ice cubes, Doctor?" 

"Til do it. You can go now." 

"But are you sure you won't 
want me later in the evening. 
Doctor? Who's to serve the sup- 
per? Who's going to clear up 
afterward?" 

"We'll manage. Don't worry 
about us." 

James shuffled out of the room, 

"I suppose that means 77/ 
manage," said Leah, with a self- 
pitying sigh. "I've noticed that 
whenever people decide to rough 
it and do without a Menial, they 
take it for granted the women 
will do the work, never the men 
— unless the women are still 
young and pretty. Well, at any 
rate, 1*11 have Tanya to help me. 



I still don't see why you wouldn't 
let me go to the Port to meet her, 
Dr. Wong/' 

"I just thought it would be 
more of a celebration if we had a 
surprise party all waiting for her 
to walk into. Dr. Haslam will 
bring her here directly from the 
Port, and here we all are, her old 
friends from the Institute, wait- 
ing to welcome her home," 

"I'd hardly say all," said Leah. 
"I'm the only person from Office 
that's here. And why have a party 
in your Library, Dr. Wong? 
Nothing here but books , books, 
books/' 

"Because I keep my liquor 
here, in the only room I have a 
right to lock up. My Menial is a 
good man, but he can't resist an 
opened bottle." 

"Well, it's still a gloomy party." 

David turned appealingly to 
his other guests, Hudson and 
Faure, but they only looked un- 
comfortable. 

"Perhaps we need a drink." 
David unlocked the cupboard 
and picked up a bottle which he 
set down hastily when he heard 
voices in the hall. He hurried to 
the outer door and opened it a 
few inches to reveal the sturdy 
shoulders of the watchguard of 
the floor and, beyond him, Karl 
Haslam. 

"Everything in order. Officer?" 
asked Karl. 

"Your permit is in order, Dr. 



CATEGORY PHOENIJ 



\t 



Haslam. A private party. Let mc 
just check — yes, three guests have 
arrived, and you two make five. 
That all? You have until mid- 
night. But it beats me why you 
people in Research prefer a- party 
without a watchguard, or why 
Leader Marley ever gives per- 
mission. Why, in all my years in 
Military, I've never been to an 
unwatched party, and I must say 
it never held us down any." 

Karl laughed a little too 
forcedly. 'Til bet it didn't! But 
all Research people are a little 
peculiar. You must have noticed 
that yourself." 

-Well—" 

"And you know how generous 
Leader Marley is, and how kind 
he is to loyal citizens. He wants 
u *to be happy, so he pampers us 
now and then." 

"I guess he knows what he's 
doing, all right. Well, I'll check 
you out at twelve, then." 

"Go on in, Tanya," said Karl. 

They stepped into the apart- 
ment and David quietly closed 
the door. 

"Hi, Sis," drawled Leah. "You 
made us wait long enough!" She 
walked toward the girl, hand out- 
stretched, then stopped with a 
gasp of disbelief. 

Tanya's red hair was still bril- 
liant and gleaming, her creamy 
skin unlined* and her full red lips 
curved up into a friendly smile as 
she leaned forward for a sisterly 



kiss. But Leah jerked away and 
glared with anger. 

A puzzled frown creased Tan- 
ya's lovely white forehead. 

"What's the matter, Leah? 
Aren't you glad to see me? You 
look so strange, as though you'd 
been terribly ill!" 

Leah shook her head, tears of 
rage gathering in her pale eyes. 
"I'm okay," she whispered. "It's 
you. You haven't changed. I 
have. You're still young, you're 

pretty, you're just the way I used 
to be/" She whirled to face David, 
her voice choking. 

"What have you done to her, 
Dr. Wong?" 

The four men in the room were 
all staring at the sisters, scarcely 
believing what they saw, although 
they had all bctn prepared for 
the contrast. The twin sisters were 
no longer twins. One had retained 
her youth; the other was faded, 
aging. 

"This is awful," Haslam mut- 
tered. "Absolutely ghastly." He 
put a comforting hand on Leah's 
shoulder, and with a deep sob she 
hid her face against him and 
cried. 

Hudson and Faure could not 
take their eyes from Tanya, and 
David leaned against the wall to 
stop his trembling. 

"Sit down, all of you," he said. 
"First we'll have a drink. I'm 
sure we all need it. Then we'll 
face — what has to be faced."

AN hour later, they had 
achieved a calmness, of sorts. 
They had given up some of their 
normal sobriety to achieve the 
calm, but they were grateful to 
the drug for cushioning the shock. 

David paced the floor, glass in 
hand, talking rapidly as he fin- 
ished his long explanation. 

"So you see what happened," 
he said, "When I began the ex- 
periment, I had no idea how stag- 
gering the results might be. That 
is, I knew in my mind, but I 
never imagined the realness of 
what would happen. I thought 
of it as just an experiment* 

Leah sniffed, her resentment 
somewhat dulled by drink. "So I 
was just an experiment! Don't 
you ever think about people's 

feelings? I know I'm not as good 

as you are; I'm only Office, but 
I'm human." 

Karl patted her hand. "Of 
course you are, Leah. But that 
is one of the defects of people in 
Research — they forget about hu- 
man emotions/' He looked up 
sternly at David. "They go ahead 
with their experiments, and hang 
the consequences. If Dr. Wong 
had had any sense, he would 
never have kept this a secret for 
ten years, and we might have 
had ten years to prepare ourselves 
for such a responsibility. Instead, 
we have only a few days or, at 
most, weeks. Hudson! Faure! 
How do you feel about this thing 



now? Are you still game?'* 

Both men seemed a little dazed, 
but Faure pulled himself to- 
gether, speaking slowly; like a 
man in a dream, 

"We're with you. It's still hard 
to believe: we*ve got immortal- 
ity r 

"I'd hardly call it immortal- 
ity," said Hudson drily, "since, 
as I understand it, SDE does not 
kill disease entities, nor ward off 
bullets or the disintegrating nuc- 
lear shaft of the needier — as we 
will very likely find out before 
very long. But what do we do 
now? When people see these two 
girls together, it won't be an, hour 
before Marley hears about it." 

David spoke up with a new 
authority. "He must not hear 
about it. I know how poorly 
equipped I am to handle this 
situation, but since I created it, I 
must assume responsibility, and 
I have made my plans. 

"First, you, Tanya. Try to 
realize that if the Leader finds 
out that I have this secret of 
keeping youth, he will want it for 
himself. Nobody in Menial, no- 
body in Office, nobody in Re- 
search — almost nobody at all— 
will be allowed to benefit from it. 
Marley will use it as a special 
reward for certain Rulers, and he 
will try to keep its very existence 
a secret so that people in general 
will not be envious or rebellious. 
That means that he will have to

If 



get rid of you.*' 

"Get rid of me? But I haven't 
done any harm!" 

"Just by existing and letting 
people look at your unchanging 
youth, you will be a threat to 
him, for you will give away his 
secret. How he'll deal with you, 
I don't know. Concentration 
camp, exile, or more probably, 
simple execution on grounds of 
treason, such as unauthorized 
choices of activity or study. It 
doesn't matter, he'll find a way. 
The only safety for you is in 
keeping hidden. You must stay 
quietly in Leah's apartment un- 
til we can find a refuge for you. 
Do you see that?" 

She looked around in bewilder* 
meat. "Is that right, Dr, Ha&lam? 
And what will they think at the 
Institute? I'm supposed to go 
back to my job in Intercom/' 

"Dr. Wong is right," he said 
kindly. "Please believe us. it's 
hard for you to understand that 
we are asking you to do some* 
thing secret, but just try to re- 
member that you are, after all, 
an Office Category and are not 
equipped by training or constitu- 
tion to think out problems like 
this. We'll tell you what is the 
right thing to do. You just do as 
we tell you, and you'll be per- 
fectly safe," 

Leah snickered, "Oh, shell be 
safe enough, being as pretty as 
she is! What are you going to do 



about me? Don't I count?" 

"We'll come to that in a few 
minutes. Right now, we need food. 
Leah, you and Tanya be good 
girls and go out to the kitchen 
and heat up some supper for us. 
After we've eaten, we'll talk about 
you/' . 

AS soon as the girls were out 
of the room, the four men 
drew together at the table. 

"No use burdening them with 
too much knowledge," Karl re- 
marked. "Even as it is, they are 
a great danger to us, and the 
less they know the better. David, 
will you proceed?" 

"I have little to add to the 
plans we made last night at the 
lab. The thing we need most is 
time; and next to that, a hiding 
place. We may very soon be 
classed as traitors, with every 
watchguard on the continent 
hunting for us. We will take care 
that they don't find us. Now, you 
said last night that each one of 
you has accumulated a Free 
Choice during the past year f 
which hasn't yet been used." 

"That's right," said Faur£. "I 
intended to use mine next winter 
to live among the Australian ab- 
origines for a week, I've been 
wanting that for years, but the 
planners always refused me; it 
was a project without practical 
purpose/* 

"And I intended to use mine

to attempt a water-color paint- 
ing," added Hudson. "In my boy- 
hood I hoped to be put in Arts 
Category, but the Planners 
laughed at me. I suppose it's 
wrong, yet I still have the yen. 

"You have my sympathy,' 
said Karl. "I was going to take 
an Aimless Tramp. Just shed my 
identity and wander on foot 
through the great north area of 
woods and Jakes/' 

David sighed; "Well, if we are 
successful in hiding and in chang- 
ing the world as we'd like, you 
can all three be free to do as you 
like without asking permission. 
But at present that's only the 
wildest of dreams. And, first, we 
must find our refuge. Today is 
Saturday. Tomorrow morning, 
each of you will go to BureauMed 
and claim your Free Choice. And * 
each of you will choose an Aim- 
less Tramp/' 

"But I don't like hiking," ob- 
jected Hudson. 

"You won't be hiking. You'll 
take off in your roboplanes and 
then disappear. You will be with- 
out supervision. You will then 
proceed, disguised as you think 
suitable, to find a place for our 
new colony — somewhere in South 
America? — and make preliminary 
arrangements to receive us. You 
must be back by Tuesday after^ 
noon at the latest. On Tuesday, 
as soon as you have reported 
back to BureauMed, get to the 



Institute as fast as you can.** 

"Why the deadline?" 

"Because by Tuesday after- 
noon, sometime before evening, 
probably, I expect all three of 
you to be suffering from an attack 
of Blue Martian Fever, and I 
want you to get expert hospital 
care. You will be the nucleus of 
the new regime/' 

Karl laughed. "I wish you 
could have picked a base for 
your SDE that was less unpleas- 
ant than Blue Martian." 

"Who's got Blue Martian?'* 
asked Tanya, as the girls came in 
from the kitchen with their trays 
of food. "I'll never forget how 
sick it made me/ 

"You should worry," said Leah. 
"It kept you young and beauti- 
ful, didn't it?" 

"You won't have to envy her, 
Leah/ f said David going to the 
liquor cabinet- "I'm going to give 
you and the others a shot of the 
SDE-Martian Blue. Sometime 
Tuesday afternoon you should 
feel the first symptoms. But after 
forty-eight hours in the hospital, 
you'll be good as new. And yon 
will all stop growing older." 

They watched, fascinated, as 
he opened the cooling compart- 
ment of the liquor cupboard, 

"I always like plenty of ice in 
my drinks/* he remarked, draw- 
ing out a tray of cubes and open- 
ing a small door behind the tray. 
He removed several small bottle*

filled with a milky liquid, and a 
copper box of sterile needles and 
syringes, 

"Who'll be first?" 

There was a knock at the door, 
and David stopped. 

"What is it?" he called. 

"Me," came the watchguard's 
voice. "Just thought I'd do you 
a favor and tell you it's only ten 
minutes till checkout time. Time 
to get yourselves decent!" 

They could hear the rumble of 
his laugh as he moved on down 
the hall. Trembling, David picked 
up a bottle, poured alcohol onto 
the rubber cap, and deftly filled 
the sterile syringe. He reached for 
a piece of cotton, dipped it in 
iodine, and looked up, waiting, 
Klfrl Haslam had already bared 
his left arm. David swabbed the

spot on the upper deltoid, 

Karl laughed. *'Here I come, 

Methuselah!* 1 

"All set?" asked David. 

He plunged the needle home. 

TTVAVID ran up the steps of the 
U Institute, two at a time, and 
hurried toward his office through 
the echoing corridors, where the 
usual watchguard sauntered on 
patrol. 

"Morning, Jones." 

"Good morning, Doctor, Pretty 
early, aren't you?" 

"Wednesday's my busy day." 
He settled at his desk, miserably 
conscious of the open door and 
curious eyes behind him, opened 
his briefcase, then glanced at his 
wristwatch. More than an hour 
before his interview with Leader 
Marley. 

Spreading some data sheets be- 
fore him, he looked at them 
blankly as he tried to order his 
thoughts. His eyes were ringed 
with dark depressions, for he had 
had no sleep. There had been so 
many things to plan for t so many 
arrangements to make. 

It was possible, of course, that 
this morning's talk would turn 
out to be mere routine. There 
might remain several weeks of 
freedom — but there might be only 
a few hours. He shrank from the 
complexity of the problem before 
him; he was a Research man, de- 
voted to his test tubes and 



culture growths, and would have 
been happy never to face any 
problem beyond them. 

He had a moment's revulsion 
at the unfairness of the fact that 
a simple experiment in the lab, 

i 

an addition to man's knowledge 
of the Universe, should have 
plunged him against his will into 
a situation far beyond his ability 
to handle. There had been, as 
Karl pointed out, the alternative 
of turning the SDE over to the 
Leader. That would have ab- 
solved him of all responsibility. 
But that was the trouble, he 
thought. Responsibility could not 
be confined to squiggles in his 
notebook, when those squiggles 
might affect the whole of society. 

"Dr. Wong!" 

He jumped and turned around 
hastily. 

"Leah! What in the world?" 

She stood in the doorway, glar- 
ing at him, breathing heavily as 
though she were trying to hold 
back sobs. Slowly she tottered 
to the desk and sank down into 
her chair By the stenograph. 

"You doublecrosser!" she whis- 
pered. 

He looked quickly at the door- 
way, but the guard had not come 
back. Leaning forward, he ques- 
tioned her fiercely. 

"What are you doing here? 
They told me yesterday that sev- 
eral people had come down with 
attacks of Blue Martian. Why

aren't you in the hospital with 
the others?" 

"Because I wasn't sick!" 

"But I gave you — " 

"Imagine how I felt,** she raced 
on, "watching Dr. Haslarn start 
having a chill, hearing Dr. Faure 
complain about his awful head- 
ache, and listening to Dr. Hudson 
dial Intercom and call for a doc- 
tor. And all that time I was wait- 
ing, waiting for something to 
happen to me. And nothing did! 
What have you got against me, 
Dr. Wong, that you infect all the 
others and only pretend to do it 
to me? I don't want to grow old 
any more than they do!" 

"But I wasn't pretending. 
Quiet, now, and let me think," 

ye waited until the watchguard 
had passed by the door, then 
raised his head. 

"Look here, Leah. Evidently 
the infection didn't take. This is 
what must have happened. That 
treatment I gave you ten years 
ago must have made you perma- 
nently immune to Blue Martian, 
and the antibodies it formed in 
your cells simply protected you 
against this new invasion of the 
virus. It never occurred to me 
that the immunity would last so 



long. But don't worry, I'll find a 

way." 

She looked suspicious. "What 
do you mean?" 

"I mean that there's no reason 
why Blue Martian should be the 



only vehicle for giving you the 
SDE. There must be other viruses 
that will work equally well. It's 
only a question of finding one." 

"And how long will that take 
you?" 

"How long does anything take 
in Research? Maybe a week, 
maybe a year." 

"And maybe ten! I can't wait, 
Dr. Wong. I'm thirty-five now; 
I'm growing older. What good 
will a long life do me, if it only 
preserves me as the middle-aged 
woman I'll be by then? And all 
those years that I'll be getting 
older and older, there'll be Tanya, 
lively and pretty, to remind me 
that I was once like that, too. I 
can't face it!" 

"The watchguard will hear 
you!" Haggard-faced, he watched 
her shaking shoulders, hearing her 
muffled sobs. 

"You're a criminal, Dr. Wong! 
It was a crime, what you did to 
Tanya and me." 

"I didn't realize in the begin- 
ning or I'd never have touched 
the thing. I know it now, even 
better than you do, but what can 
I do?" 

She looked up and wiped her 
eyes, her mouth set hard. "I know 
what I can do. I can report you 
to the Leader." 

"What good will that do? You 
know how terrible you feel now 
about being left out — though I 
swear I never meant it to be like

this. But just try to imagine. If 
you report me so that Leader 
Marley gets the secret of SDE, 
then thousands of people will be 
put in just the same situation you 
are in. You're only one person 
suffering. But then there'd be 
hundreds of thousands, millions! 
Surely you wouldn't want to 
have that on your conscience?" 
Do you think I'd care?" 

You would when you felt 
calmer. You're wrought up, ill. 
Let me send you home. Promise 
me you'll go home quietly, talk 
it over with Tanya, and not say 
anything to anyone else. I'll think 
of a way out for you. Just be 
patient." 

"Patient!" 

He thought of calling Karl 
Haslam. Karl would know best 
how to deal with her, how to 
bring her back to reason. He 
reached toward the intercom, 
then dropped his hand in despair. 
Karl was in the hospital, with 
Fauree and Hudson, shivering 
with the cold of Blue Martian 
fever. But he had to get her away. 

He pressed the intercom dial, 
•*Dr. Wong speaking. Miss Hach- 
ovnik is ill and is being sent home. 
Please send an aircab for her at 
once." 

He helped Leah to her feet, 
and spoke pleadingly. 

"Promise you'll be good, 
Leah?" 

The fury in her eyes nearly 



knocked him down. Without a 
word, without a gesture, she 
walked out. 

DAVID felt as though he'd 
been put through a wringer 
as he followed Officer Magnun 
into the Leader's suite at State 
House. Several nights of sleep- 
lessness, the worries of planning 
for a refuge, and the scene with 
Leah had left him limp and spirit- 
less. The girl was a danger, he 
knew, but she was only one of 

many. 

He nodded at Dr. Lanza, who 
was busy reading reports from 
BureauMed, and saluted Leader 
Marley, who was talking with a 
watchguard. 

Marley looked up briefly. "Sit 
down, Wong." 

David folded himself into a 
chair, grateful for a few moments 
in which to collect himself, while 
Marley gave the last of his orders. 

"Put them in the Vermont 
granite quarries, and keep them 
at work for the next year." 

"As you say, Leader. With the 
usual secrecy, of course?" 

"No, you blockhead! These are 
a bunch of nobodies. Use all the , 
publicity you can get. Keep a 
punishment a secret and how can 
it have any effect on other peo- 
ple? No, I want full radio and 
news coverage and telecast show- 
ings as they swing the first pick

got to realize that the Leader 
knows best, that treason doesn't 
pay. No matter how clever they 
think they are, they'll always get 
caught. Understand?" 

"As you say, Leader/* 

"Then get going. 1 ' As the guard 
left the room, Leader ^Marley 
turned to David. "What fools 
people are!" 

He ran his beefy hands through 
a shock of black hair, blinked his 
eyes, and wrinkled the heavy 
black brows that met over his 
nose. Wonderingly, he shook 
his massive head as he drew his 
gleaming needier from his breast 
pocket and played with it, tossing 
it from hand to hand while he 
talked, * 

"I'm probably the most gener- 
ous Leader the State has had 
since the Atomic Wars, Wong, 
and I never withhold a privilege 
from someone who has deserved 
it. But people mistake me when 
they think that I am weak and 
will overlook treason." 

"Your generosity is a byword, 
Leader Marley/' said Wong. "But 
some people are incapable of act- 
ing for their best interests even 
when you have defined it for 
them. Who are these latest trai- 
tors?" 

"Oh, nobody really important, 
of course, except as they waste 
time which they owe to the State. 
Just attempts at illegal study. An 
Office Category who had found 



a basement room in a deserted 
building and was spending all his 
evening hours there practicing 
the violin, A Theater man who 
was illegally trying to learn car- 
pentry. And a teacher of mathe- 
matics who had forged a key to 
the Linguistics library, and had 
been getting in every night to 
study a dead language — Cunei- 
form, Latin, something like that, 
utterly without practical value. 
This last one is an old man, too, 
and ought to have known better- 
People must be made to realize 
that if they want the privilege 
of useless study, they will have 
to earn it. And I am very broad- 
minded in such cases. 

"Nobody has better reason to 
know that than I, Leader Marley, 
and I am always grateful to you." 

Marley coughed and straight- 
ened the jacket over his bearlike 
chest as he put back his needier, 

"Now to business. Where*s that 
memorandum, Lanza?'* 

Dr. Lanza handed him the 
paper, then sat down beside the 
Leader. 

"First. When Dr. Lanza called 
on you last week, he found the 
door to your office locked. What 
explanation do you have?** 

David smiled and spread his 
hands. "My explanation- is the 
generosity of Leader Marley. You 
have so many affairs to occupy 
your attention that it is not sur- 
prising that you do not remember 



v

rewarding me with a Free Choice 
some years ago, for my work on 
Martian Blue, I chose, as I am 
sure you remember now, an oc- 
casional hour of Privacy." 

The Leader blinked. "That's 
right I had forgotten. Well, the 
Leader never goes back on his 
word. Though why in the name 
of Marley you fellows want a 
crazy thing like that is beyond 
me. What do you do, behind a 
locked door, that you don't want 
anyone to see?'* 

"Do you doubt my loyalty, 
Leader Marley?" 

"I doubt everything. What do 
you want with Privacy?" 

Lanza broke in amiably. "I'm 
afraid we just have to accept 
such wishes as one of the harm- 
less abnormalities of the Re- 
search mind, Leader. Since I grew 
up in that Category, I understand 
it to some extent." 

"You're right in calling it ab- 
normal. I think perhaps I'd bet- 
ter remove that from the possible 
Choices in the future. It could 
easily be misused, and it never 
did make any sense to me. 

"Well, second. It's been more 
than three years since you re- 
ported any progress with the 
problem of White Martian Fever, 
Wong. What is your explana- 
tion?" 

"Research is not always swift. 
Leader/* 

"But I distinctly ordered you 



to find an immunizing agent 
within three years. Our colonies 
on Mars cannot wait forever. I've 
been patient with you, but you've 
had more than enough time." 

"I am very sorry, Leader Mar- 
ley, I have done my best and so 
have my colleagues. But the 
problem is complex. If I may 
explain, we had to find a suitable 
culture medium for growing the 
virus, and then we had to work 
at the problem of coupling it 
with suitable haptens — " 

Impatiently, Marley waved his 
hand. "You know I don't under- 
stand your jargon. That's not my 
business, what troubles you've 
had- I want results- You got re- 
sults on Blue Martian quickly 
enough." 

"We were fortunate. But when 
we storm the citadel of knowl- 
edge, Leader Marley, no one can 
predict how long it will take for 
the citadel to fall." 

"Nonsense! I'm warning you, 
Wong, you're failing in your duty 
to the State, and you can't escape 
the consequences with poetic 
doubletalk. I allow special privi- 
leges to you people in Research 
and I expect a proper apprecia- 
tion in return. When I order you 
to produce a protection for White 
Martian, I want results!" 

"But you can't get a thing like 
that just by asking for it. Such 
things are simply not under your 
control."

"Watch yourself, Wong! Your 
remarks are dangerously close* to 
treason!" 

"Is it treason to tell you a 
plain fact?" 

Stony-faced, David stared de- 
fiantly at Marley, trying to con- 
trol the trembling of his 'body. If 
he had had a needier at that in- 
stant, he realized incredulously, 
he would have shot the Leader 
and thought his own life a small 
price to pay for such a pleasure- 
Lanza coughed. "Fm afraid Dr. 
Wong is not well, Leader. Worry- 
ing over the slowness of his work 
has distorted his reactions. But I 
am sure that you will understand, 
as you always do, and be indul- 
gent." 

"<£11 overlook your remarks, 
Wong/* said Marley, relaxing. 
"But you'd better change your 
attitude. You Research people 
cause me more trouble than any 
other three Categories put to- 
gether* Sometimes I wonder if a 
spell in the granite quarries 
mightn't—" 

A light flashed on his desk. He 
watched the blinking code for a 
second, then ro^e abruptly and 
left the room. 

The two men sat in silence. 
David glanced at Lanza, and 
Lan^a shifted in his chair, 

"Thanks for the good word," 
said David wcnily. "How do you 
like being a 7?u1er f by the way? 
When we were at Med school to- 



gether, I thought you were a man 
with ideas." 

"When I was at Medschool I 
didn't know what was good for 
me," Lanza replied stiffly. 

"And you think you do now?" 

A slow flush crept over Lanza's 
face. "Look Here, Wong! Each 
man has to make his own terms 
with himself. Don't act so smug! 
You shut yourself away inside the 
nice white walls of your labora- 
tory and ignore all the conflicts 
of life. You shut your ears and 
your eyes, live in perfect har- 
mony with your test tubes, and 
let the world go hang. Well, that 
isn't my way." 

"Your way, apparently, is to 
worm yourself into the confidence 
of that steel-hearted imbecile who 
rules our lives and our thoughts, 
and spend twenty-four hours a 
day saying, 'Yes, Yes/ and wait- 
ing for him to die so you can step 
into his shoes!" 

"We're alone/' Said Lanza. "I 
won't report you. But I have no 
intention of justifying myself. 
Have you any idea why you've 
been let alone for so long? You 
haven't produced anything tangi- 
ble in several years. Haven't you 
ever wondered why no one put on 
the pressure? Haven't — " 

He broke off as Marley lum- 
bered back into the room and 
fell into a chair. The Leader's 
manner had altered. He stared at 
David with grim inquiry, the 



28 




 



'^ 



beady eyes traveling slowly over 
him, taking in his rumpled hair, 
his strained face, the rigid set of 
his shoulders. 

At last Marley spoke, his voice 
soft with menace. 

*'You*re looking well, Dr. 
Wong. Remarkably well. In fact, 
it occurs to me that you don't 
seem to have aged a bit since my 
last visit to your laboratory. Tell 
me, how do you keep your 
youth?" 

DAVID could feel the rush of 
blood through his body, feel 
the thud of his racing heart. He 
kept his voice low so that it would 
not tremble. 

"Thank you, Leader Marley, 

for your kindness in noticing my 
appearance. I suppose I chose my 
parents well. They both lived to 
be over ninety, you know." 

"This is no joking matter. I've 
just had a report. An epidemic 
of Blue Martian fever has broken 
out among the people of your 
Institute. Why have you not 
mentioned it?" 

"If you will forgive me, Leader 
Marley, I've had no chance. I 
reported it in the usual manner 
to the health authorities, and 
have here in my briefcase a mem- 
orandum which I hoped to bring 
to your attention, among several 
other matters, when you had fin- 
ished giving your instructions to 



me. 



** 



Marley continued implacably, 
"And how did this epidemic be- 
gin? It was my understanding 
that ho insect existed here on 
Earth that could transmit the 
virus. Yet several people from 
your lab came down with the 
disease on the same day. What 
is your explanation?" 

"It*s very simple. To prepare 
the vaccine, as I am sure you 
will remember from your last 
visit to us, we have to keep in the 
lab a limited number of the Faili, 
the Martian insects which act as 
hosts at one stage of the virus s 
life. Last week a Menial care- 

■ 

lessly knocked over one of the 
cages and several Faili escaped. 
The Menial was discharged , of 
course, and put in Punishment, 
but the damage had already been 
done." 

"You have a very ready ex- 
planation." 

"Would you rather I had none 
at all, Leader Marley?" 

"Well, let that go." Marley 
drummed his plump fingers on 
the desk as he continued. "There 
was another report for me just 
now. A report so wild, so incredi- 
ble, so staggering that I can 
scarcely bring myself to take it 
seriously. From an Office Cate- 
gory at the Institute." 

David's heart beat wildly, but 
he forced a smile to his lips. "Oh, 
yes. You must mean Miss Hach- 
ovnik. I've been worried about

that poor girl for some time,** 

"What do you mean, 'poor 
girl'?" 

"It's very distressing to me, be- 
cause she has been a good and 
loyal worker for many years. But 
she is becoming unstable. She has 
a tendency to burst into tears 
over nothing, is sometimes hys- 
terical, seems to have secret 
grievances, and is extremely jeal- 
ous of all women whom she con- 
siders more attractive. She was 
never too bright, to be sure, but 
until recently she has done her 
work well, so I've hated to take 
any action. Just this morning I 
had to send her home because she 
was ill." 

"Do you mean to say," asked 
Myley, "that none of her story 
is true?" 

"I don't know- What is her 
story?" 

"She reports that you have 
been working on a private project 
of your own, instead of on White 
Martian, That you have discov- 
ered a way to make people im- 
tnortal, by infecting them with 
Blue Martian. What is your ex- 
planation?*' 

David only stared, his mind so 
blurred with panic that he could 
not speak. His stunned silence 
was broken by a laugh. It was 
Dr. Lanza, leaning backward in 
his chair, holding himself over 
the stomach as he shook his head. 

"These hysterical women!" His 



laughter trailed off to a com- 
miserating chuckle. "You're too 
forbearing, Wong. You shouldn't 
keep a worker who's so far gone- 
Take a leaf from Leader Marley's 
book and remember: Kindness is 
often weakness; when it is neces- 
sary for the good of the State, be 
harsh!" 

"I hardly know what to say," 
said David, "I had no idea she'd 
gone so far/' 

"Then there's no truth in it?" 
Marley persisted, "What she says 
is impossible?" 

"Well," said David judiciously, 
"we people in Research have 
learned not to call anything im- 
possible, but this dream of im- 
mortality is as old as the human 
race. We have a thousand legends 
about it, including the story of 
the Phoenix, that fabulous bird 
which, when consumed by fire, 
rose triumphant from its own 
ashes to begin life anew. A pretty 
story, of course. But I need only 
put it to a mind as logical as 
yours, Leader Marley. Through- 
out all the millenia of msyi's ex- 
istence, the Sun has always risen 
each morning in the east, and 
thus we kaow that it always will. 
That is the order of nature. Like- 
wise, from the earliest generations 
of man, no individual has ever 
lived longer than a hundred and 
some years, and thus we know 
that he never will. That is the 
order of Nature and we can't alter

n 



it to the best of my knowledge. 

Leader Marley was thoughtful. 
He touched the intercom, 

"Send in Officer Magnun." 

David held his breath. 

"Magnun, Office Category 
Hachovnik is to be taken from 
her home at once and put in in- 
definite Psycho-detention." 

Marley stood up. "Very well, 
Dr. Wong, You may go. But I 
shall suspend your privilege of 
Privacy, at least until after you 
have devised a protection against 
White Martian. It is -not wise to 
disregard the wishes of the 
Leader. Lanza, show him out/* 

At the street door, they paused. 
Lanza looked at David specula- 
tively. 

"You do keep your youth well, 
David." 

"Some people do," 

4< I remember that legend of the 
Phoenix. What do you suppose 
the Phoenix did with his new 
life, once he'd risen from the 
ashes of his old self?" 
I'm no philosopher." 
'Neither am I. But you and I 
both know that the principle of 
induction was exploded centuries 
ago. It's true that the Sun has 
always risen in the east. But is 
there anything to keep it, some- 
day, from rising in the west?" 

rpHAT night David sat late at 

-* his desk. Through the open 

door behind him, he could hear 



* * t * . 



i* 



the watchguard slowly pacing the 
dimly lit corridor. He could feel 
time pressing at his back. He 
was reprieved, he knew, but for 
how long? 

He got up, at one point, when 
the corridor behind him was 
quiet, and went to the bookcase. 
He pressed the brass handle, saw 
the shelves silently swing away 
from the wall, then set it back 
again. The mechanism, installed 
a century ago by a cautious poli- 
tician, was still in good order. 

Back at his desk, he thought of 
Leah and her lost youth, lost be- 
cause of his own impersonal at- 
titude. He felt sorry for her, but 
there was nothing he could do 
for her now. It was a relief to 
know that Tanya, at least, re- 
mained hidden and secure in her 

sister's apartment. 

It was after midnight before he 
closed his notebook and locked it 
away in the top drawer. His plans 
were completed. There would not 
be time given him, he knew, to 
finish his work on White Mar- 
tian. That would have to be 
dropped, and resumed at some 
more favorable time in the future 
— if there was a future for him. 
But he would begin at once to 
produce in quantity a supply of 
the SDE-Blue Martian, for he 
was sure that the untrained 
guards who watched his move- 
ments would never realize that 
he had shifted to another project,

With a brief good night to the 
guard, he left the building to 
walk home. His shoulders were 
straight, his stride confident, and 
he disdained looking behind him 
to see if anyone was following. 
He had made his terms with him- 
self, and only death, which he 
would certainly try to prevent, 
could alter his plans. 

Going into his apartment he 
wearily turned on the light. Then 
he froze, feeling as though he 
had been clubbed. Leah Hachov- 
nik was huddled at one end of 
the sofa, her face dripping tears. 

"1 thought you'd never come," 
she whispered. 

He slumped down beside her. 
"How did you get here, Leah? I 
thought you were — " 

**T hid in your hallway until 
the watch guard was at the other 
end. When his back was turned, 
I just took off my shoes and 
slipped in. I've been waiting for 
hours." Her voice was almost in- 
audible, spent beyond emotion. 

"They got Tanya," she said 
dully. "They took her away/* 
'What happened? Quick!" 
'After I reported to Bureau- 
Med — I'm sorry I did that, Dr. 
Wong, but I just couldn't help 
myself. I didn't tell them about 
Tanya and the others, just about 
you. Then I walked around for 
hours, hating you, hating Tanya, 
hating everybody. Finally I got 
so tired that I went home. Just as

I got into the hall, I heard a 
loud knock and I saw Officer 
Magnun at my door. When 
Tanya opened it, he simply said, 
'Office Category Hachovnik?' 
When she nodded her head, he 
said, 'You're under detention/ 
She screamed and she fought, but 
he took her away. Since then, 
I've been hiding. I'm afraid/* 

David tried to think. He re- 
membered that he had said only 
"Miss Hachovnik" in his talk 
with the Leader. Had Marley 
never known that there was more 
than one? But Lanza surely knew. 
Or had he merely assumed that 
Magnun would ask for Leah? 
Would they realize, at Psycho- 
detention, that they had the 
wrong woman? Probably not, for 
she would be hysterical with ter- 
ror, and her very youth and 
beauty taken in connection with 
the "jealousy and envy of 
younger women" which was noted 
in her commitment order, would 
seem to confirm her madness. He 
was still safe, for a while — if he 
could keep Leah away from the 
Institute. 

"I'm afraid," she whimpered. 
"Don't let them put me away/* 

"Then you'll have to do exactly 
as I tell you. Can you follow 
orders exactly?" 
Yes, yes!"

Whatever happens, Leah — no 
matter what happens — keep

life depends on that/* 

WHEN the three Qonvaleseents 
returned from the hospital, 
pale and shaky, David sum- 
moned them to his office. At the 
door, Watchguard Jones looked 
them over. 

"Say, that Blue Martian fever 
sure does take it out of you. You 
fellows look like you've been 
plenty sick!" 

"They have been," said David, 
"Let them by so they can sit 
down and rest," 

Jones moved aside, but he 
lounged in the doorway, listen- 
ing. 

David ignored him. "Glad to 
see you back, gentlemen. Til 
make this brief. You have been 
the victims of a laboratory acci- 
dent just as much as if you'd 
been contaminated with radia- 
tion. Our Leader Marley, who 
understands the problems of all 
Categories, has very generously 
consented to grant you a two 
weeks' convalescence, in addition 
to a Free Choice. Take a few 
minutes to think over your de- 
cision." 

He strolled over to the window 
and looked out at the green of 
the trees just bursting into leaf. 



Then, as if on impulse, he turned 
back, 

"While you're thinking it over, 
will you look at these protocols? 
We discussed them before you 
got sick, you remember — a plan, 
to prevent an epidemic of Blue 
Martian. Do you approve of the 
final form? I'd like to carry on, 
and after all," he added with an 
ironic smile, "it's getting later 
than we might think." 

He handed each man a sheet 
of paper whose contents were 
identical. They studied them. 
Karl Haslam was the first to 
speak. 

"You think, then, that other 
cases of Blue Martian may de- 
velop?" 

"It is certainly probable. Those 
Fafli insects were never caught/* 

Karl looked back at his paper. 
It contained a list of names, some 
of which were well known to all 
the country, some of them ob- 
scure. Thoughtfully, he nodded 
as he ran down the list. 

Hudson glanced up, frowning, 
his finger pointed at one name, 

"I don't know," he said slowly, 
"that this particular experiment 
would prove useful. Surely the 
Lanza method has not proved to 
be as effective as we once hoped/' 

"You may be right. But there's 
the bare possibility that the 
modified Lanza method might be 
of enormous benefit to us/* 

"It is uncertain. Too much of

a risk. Tat's my opinion/' 

"Then Til reconsider. The rest 
has your approval? Very well. 
And now what choice have you 
made for your holiday?" 

"I think we are all agreed," 
said Karl soberly. "We'll have an 
Aimless Tramp." 

"An excellent idea," approved 
David. "Oh, Jones, will you get 
an aircab to take the doctors to 
BureauMed, and then arrange for 
their Roboplanes to be serviced 
and ready in an hour?" 

"I don't know as I ought to 
leave my post," said Jones. 

"You'd rather stay with us and 
perhaps be exposed to the Fever? 11 

'\>kay, okay!" 

When his footsteps had died 
away, David leaned forward. 

**We've done our best. Another 
month or so and we should be 
completely ready for our retire- 
ment act." 

"If we have a month," said 
Faure. 

David grinned. "Well, if our 
time runs out, at least we'll go 
down fighting. You know all your 
lines, your props are ready, the 
plot is worked out, and we can 
slip into our makeup in an in- 
stant — provided the audience 
shows up." 

"You're getting to be quite a 
joker, David," said Karl. "What 

if the audience comes around to 
the stage door?" 

*Then we'll try to receive him 



properly. Our Leader is a man of 

iron, but I doubt that he's im- 
mortal." 

They heard the approaching 
guard. 

"I'm sure you'll benefit from 
your holiday/' David went on. 
"That last .checkup showed an 
antibody titer entirely too high 
for safety." 

"In other words, it's time for 
us to get going?" asked Karl, 
smiling. 

"That's right. Only the next 
time the antibody curve rises, it 
will be for keeps." 

FOUR days later it was re- 
ported that Judge Brinton, the 
well-known champion of Cate- 
gory rights, was ill with Blue 
Martian fever* Three little-known 
nuclear physicists living in the 
same apartment in Oak Ridge 
developed symptoms on the same 
day. Sporadic cases of Blue Mar- 
tian flared up all over the conti- 
nent. Occasionally a whole family 
was affected — husband, wife, and 
all the children. There was a 
mild epidemic at MIT, a more 
serious one at the School of So- 
cial Structure, and at Harvard 
Medical School nearly a third 
of the senior class, and they the 
most brilliant; were hospitalized 
at the same time. 

Rumors blanketed the country 
like a fog, and people everywhere 
became uneasy. There were no 



34 




 



deaths from the illness, but the 
very idea that an infectious dis- 
ease could flare up unpredictably 
all over the nation, put of con- 
trol, was frightening. It was said 
that the disease had been beamed 
to Earth by alien enemies from 
space; that all its victims became 
sterile; or that their minds were 
permanently damaged. 

It was also said, though people 
laughed even as they repeated the 
rumor, that if you once had Blue 
Martian Fever you'd become im- 
mortal. This particular theory 
had been clearly traced to the 
ravings of a red-haired mad- 
woman who was confined to 
Psychodetention, but still it was 
too ridiculous not to repeat. For 
a week, comedians rang a hun- 
dred changes on the basic joke: 

Wife: Drop dead! 

Husband: I can't. Fve had 
Blue Martian, 

The unrest became so great 
that Leader Marley himself ap- 
peared on the telecaster to reas- 
sure the nation. 

He was an impressive figure on 
the lighted screen, resting solid 
and at ease in a leather chair, 
raising his massive black head, 
lifting his big hand to gesture as 
his rich voice rolled out. 

"You have nothing to fear," 
he said. "Under your beneficent 
Leaders, infectious disease has 
been wiped out many years ago. 
BureauMed informs me that 



these scattered cases of Blue 
Martian fever have been caused 
by the escape of a few Fafli in- 
sects, which have, since then, 
been isolated and destroyed. The 
illness has no serious after-effects. 
And as for the rumors that it 
confers immortality — " 

He allowed his face to break 
into a pitying smile as he slowly 
shook his head, looking regretful 
and fet somehow amused. 

"Those who continue to spread 
gossip about the fever will only 
reveal themselves as either psy- 
chotics or traitors. Whichever 
they are, they will be isolated 
for the good of our society." 

The effect of his words was 
somewhat diminished by the 
brief glimpse people had of Dr. 
Larlza, who reached a hand to 
help the Leader rise. For Dr. 
Lanza wore an anxious frown, 
and his face was thin with worry. 

In spite of numerous arrests, 
the rurtiors continued. For two 
weeks sporadic outbreaks of the 
fever occurred, and then, abrupt' 
ly, they ceased. 

TT was more than a week after 
*■ the last case had been reported 
that David sat in his basement 
laboratory beside the opened 
mouse cage, watching with wry 
affection as the furry creatures 
crawled over his hand. These 
were historic mice, he reflected, 
whose reactions to SDE had

opened up a new world, a world 
which he must somehow help to 
make better than the present one. 

His three colleagues had re- 
turned a few days ago from their 
holiday. They had calmly come 
back to work, and apparently 
nobody had thought to put two 
and two together, and thus con- 
nect the epidemic with the vaca- 
tioners. It had been unfortunate 
that Tanya should have been put 
under arrest; it was difficult try- 
ing to find amusement for Leah 
so that she would keep out of 
sight, but still, on the whole, 
thejr luck had been good. 

But it was time for David to 
go back to work in his office. 
Gently he detached the mice 
from his hand, dropped them 
into* their cage, and closed the 
wire trap. He took his leather 
pencil case and the keys to his 
desk from the pocket of his lab 
coat and laid them on the desk, 
below the nail on which his 
wristwatch hung. Carelessly he 
dropped his lab coat onto the 
desk and reached for his jacket, 
then paused, listening. 

The chatter in the technicians* 
room suddenly died. In the un- 
natural quiet sounded a steady 
march of feet. 

David turned to meet the prob- 
ing black eyes of Leader Marley. 
Just behind him were Dr. Lanza 
and Officer Magnun. 

There was no time to conceal 



his mice, David realized. Shrug- 
ging into his jacket, he strode 
forward without hesitation, a 
smile on his face, and stretched 

out his hand. 

"Leader Marley! This is in- 
deed an honor. If you had only 
notified us of your visit, we 
should have been prepared." 

"Young as ever, I see, Wong," 

"Thank you. Leader." There 
was no banter in Marley's eyes, 
he noted, but he continued amia* 
bly. "It has been some years 
since you have honored us by a 
visit in person. I'm afraid a lab- 
oratory is not a very exciting 
place, but I'd be honored to show 
you anything that may be of in- 
terest to you." 

A faint contempt curled Mar- 
ley's mouth as he glanced around 
the room. "Nothing to see that 
I haven't seen before, is there? 
A lot of test tubes, a bunch of 
flasks, a mess of apparatus you'd 
think had been dreamed up by 
an idiot, and a bad smell. You 
still keep animals*- I notice." 

He sauntered over to the 
bench, picked up the cage and 
looked at the scurrying rodents. 

David scarcely breathed. 

Marley only nodded. "Well, 
mice are mice." He put down the 
cage and turned away, "These 
look just like the ones I saw 
when I was here eight or ten 
years ago. Same white patch on 
the forelimbs. I never knew mice 



3* 




 



could live that long." 

"But — " began Lanza, bending 
over to study the mice. 

"What an amazing memory 
you have, Leader/' said David. 
"Just as you guessed, these mice 
are the direct descendants of the 
ones you saw on your former 
visit, a special mutant strain. The 
chief difference is that these are 
marked with white patches on 
the right forelimbs, while, as I 
am sure you recall, the original 
specimens were marked on the 
left forelimbs. Odd how these 
marks run in families, isn't it?" 

Lanza put down the cage and 
strolled toward the door as Mar* 
ley took a last bored look around. 

"Nothing new here that I ought 
to see, Lanza?" 

"No. Nothing new." 

"Well, I've no time to waste. 
I've come here for two reasons, 
Dr. Wong. We both want a 
booster shot for Blue Martian. 
Ten years is a long time, and 
there's been this epidemic." 

"Which is now under control." 

"That may be, but I still want 
a booster. You Research people 
don't always know as much as 
you think you do. When that's 
done, I want a detailed report of 
your progress on White Mar- 
tian." 

"I shall be hapy to give it>" 
said David. "If you will go di- 
rectly to my office, I'll pick up 
the vaccine and syringes, and be 



with you in a few minutes,** 

Marley and Officer Magnun 
marched to the door, and David 
followed, standing aside to let 
Lanza precede him. Lanza hesi- 
tated there, staring at the floor. 
Then he smiled and looked di- 
rectly at David* 

"Beautiful spring weather we 
are having, I'm wondering about 
the marvelous order of nature. 
Did you happen to notice, this 
morning, whether the Sun did 
actually rise in the east?" 

David stared at the retreating 
back. There was no longer any 
doubt m his mind. Lanza knew. 
What was he going to do? 

"Hurry up, Doctor," said Offi- 
cer Magnun from the doorway. 

"Right away." He opened the 
refrigerator and inspected the 
two groups of red-capped vials 
sitting on the shelf. He had no 
time to think, no time to weigh 
pros and cons; he could only act. 
Choosing two vials, he added 
them to the sterile kit from the 
autoclave, and took a last look 
around. 

He noticed his watch still hang- 
ing on the wall, and the lab coat 
which covered his leather pen- 
cil case. He started to take them, 
then slowly dropped his hand 
and touched the intercom. 

"Get me Dr. Karl Haslam." 

"You're keeping the Leader 
waiting," said Magnun, but 
David paid no attention.

"Dr. Haslam? Dr. Wong 
speaking, I may be a little late 
getting up to see those precipi- 
tates of yours. But you keep 
them simmering, just in case. It's 
very probable that the antibody 
curve will rise, . . . Yes, I'll let 
you know if I can." 

Magnun followed him to the 
office, then strolled away for a 
chat with Watchguard Jones. 

David put his things on his 
desk and made his preparations 
in businesslike fashion while 
Marley and Lanza glanced curi- 
ously around the office. He 
watched apprehensively as Mar- 
ley inspected the bookcase, then 
turned away. 

"I never could understand why 
Research needs so many books," 
he remarked. 

"Please roll up your sleeve, 
Leader Marley. I'm ready for 
you now." 

Deftly he assembled the syr- 
inge, filled it to the two centi- 
meter mark, and scrubbed the 
arm presented to him, 

"Ready?" He ihserted the 
needle and slowly expelled the 
fluid. Then, taking a fresh syr- 
inge, he repeated the operation, 
filling from the second vial, 

"Why do those bottles have 
different numbers?" asked Mar- 
ley. "Aren't we getting the same 
thing?" 

"Certainly. Just lab routine, 
io we can keep track of how 



many writs have been used from 
our stock. There, that does it, 
Lanza. Both of you will" be per* 
fectly safe for a good many years 
to come." 

He was washing his hands at 
the sink when he heard a strug- 
gle at the door. Turning, he saw 
Leah, thin, gaunt and terrified, 
held fast in the grip of Officer 
Magnun, who forced her inside 
and slammed the door behind 
them. 

"What's the meaning of this 
intrusion?" demanded Marley. 

"There's some funny business 
going on, Leader," said Magnun. 
"I caught this woman trying to 
sneak in here. She says she's 
Miss Hachovnik and she works 

i 

here. Only she ain't, I arrested 
Miss Hachovnik myself, and I 
remember well enough what she 
looked like. She was a cute chick, 
not a bit like this dame." 

Marley was staring at the sob- 
bing girl, eyes blinking as he 
thought, looked back, remem- 
bered. Slowly his eyes shifted to 
David, and David felt like a man 
impaled, 

"You may leave, Magnun," 
said the Leader. 

"You don't want me to arrest 
this woman?" 

"Let go of her! I said you may 
leave!" 

"As you say, Leader." 

When the door closed, the 
room throbbed to Leah's sobs.

"I couldn't help it, Dr. Wong," 
she cried. "I got so bored, sitting 
and looking at those books, day 
after day, with nothing to do! I 
thought I'd just slip down here 
for an hour and say hello to 
people, and — " 

"Quiet, Hachovnik!" roared 
Marley. He quieted his voice. "I 
understand now, Wong. I remem- 
ber. There were two girls. Twins. 
The one in Psycho- detention, ac- 
cording to Officer Magnun, is still 
beautiful and young. It's no use, 
Wong. You do know the secret 
of immortality. And you told me 
the Phoenix was only a fairy 
tale!" 

DAVID felt entirely calm. 
Whatever might happen now, 
at least the suspense was over* 
He had done all he could, and it 
was a relief to have things in the 
open. He thought fleetingly of 
his colleagues, alerted by his 
message, frantically putting their 
plans into operation, but he 
leaned back against the sink with 
every appearance of ease. 

"You're not quite right, Leader 
Marley. I cannot confer immor- 
tality. All I am able to do is 
stave off the aging process." 

"That will do me nicely. And 
it's connected somehow with the 
Blue Martian virus?" 

"Yes. The disease serves as the 
vehicle." 

With a brisk motion, Marley 



drew his needier from his breast 
pocket and aimed it steadily at 
David. "Give it to me/" 

"You're rather ambiguous," 
said David. How were his friends 
getting along? Were they ready 
yet? Had Karl visited the base- 
ment lab? "Do you mean you 
want me to give you the injection 
to prolong your life, or the secret 
of how to do it, or what?" 

"Don't quibble! First you'll 
give me the injection to make 
me immortal. Then you'll turn 
over to me all your notes on pro- 
cedure. Then my friend here will 
needle you with a shaft of elec- 
trons and end your interest in 
the problem." 

"Surely you won't keep such 
a good thing all for yourself /* 
said David. "What about Dr. 
Lanza? He's your right-hand 
man. Don't you want him to 
live forever, too? What about 
Officer Magnun? He's a faithful 
servant." 

"You're stalling, Wong. Do 
you want me to kill you now?" 

"It won't be wise to needle 
me yet, Leader Marley. The se- 
cret would be lost forever." 

"I'll have your notes!" 

"Yes? Try to read them* 
They're written in Coptic, a dead 
language that you consider it a 
waste pf time to learn, because 
such knowledge is impractical* 
There aren't half a dozen men 
on Earth who could make head

or tail of my notebook. 1 

"Then I'll find that half-dozen! 
I want the injection." He ges- 
tured with the gleaming weapon. 

"This is once when I have no 
Free Choice," said David. "Very 
well." He started toward the 
door, but halted at the roar of 
command. 

"Stop! Do you think I'm fool 
enough to let you out of my 
sight?" 

"But I have to get the inocu* 
lant" 

"Use the intercom. Send for 



it. 



t» 



David slumped into the chair 
and opened the intercom. He 
could almost feel the electronic 
shaft of the needier ripping into 
his body. His heart beat wildly, 
aitS the tension of adrenalin ran 
through his body. His lips felt 
cold, but he held them steady as 
he spoke into the dial. 

"Get me Dr. Haslam. . . • 
Karl? David Wong speaking. 
Will you send someone up with 
a vial of phoenix special? 
The precipitates? I should say 
the antibody titer has reached the 
danger point. Don't delay treat- 
ment any longer," 

Silently th^y waited. Marley's 
grim face did not relax; his eyes 
were alight. Leah lay back in her 
chair with closed eyes, and Lanza 
stared intently at the floor. 

A soft knock came at the door, 
and a female technician hurried 



in, carrying a tray. 

"I'm sorry to be so slow, Dr. 
Wong, Dr. Haslam had a little 
trouble locating the right vial. 
Oh, and he said to tell you not 
to worry about those precipitates. 
They're taken care of." 

"Just a minute," said David. 
"Leader Marley, Miss Hachov- 
nik here is very ill. Won't you let 
this girl help her to the rest 
room? She'll be safe there until 
you're ready for her." 

Marley looked at the half- 
fainting woman. "All right. You 
take her there, Lanza, and this 
girl too. Lock them in. And she's 
not to talk. Do you understand? 
She's not to talk!" 

"As you say, Leader Marley," 
the technician whispered. She 
helped Leah to her feet, and 
Lanza followed them from the 
room. 

Marley closed the door and 
locked it. "Now, then, Wong, 
give me that shot, and heaven 
help you if you try any tricks!" 

"Will you bare your arm whil 
I prepare the syringe?" 

Awkwardly hanging onto the 
needier, Marley tugged at his 
sleeve while David calmly picked 
up a bottle of colorless liquid and 
filled his syringe. He turned to 
the Leader, swabbed his arm, 
then picked up the syringe. 

"There you are," said David. 

Jerking the syringe upward, he 
forced a thin jet of pure alcohol 



40 




 



into the man's eyes. Marley 
screamed. Agonizing pain blinded 
him, and as he clutched at his 
eyes, David snatched the needier 
from the writhing fingers, and 
flashed the electronic dagger 
straight to the heart. 

He stared at the twitching 
body for only an instant. People 
were pounding on the door, 
shouting. He tugged at the desk 
drawer to get his notebook, then 
remembered sickly that he had 
left his keys in the lab. He would 
have to leave his notes. 

The shouts were growing 
louder, people were battering the 
door. Swiftly he moved to the 
bookcase, swung it away from 
the wall, and dropped into dark- 
ness. 

He brought the bookcase back, 
then turned and ran along the 
black passageway, 

1EADER Lanza sat in hts suite 
at State House, conferring 
with his subordinates. 

"It hardly seems possible, 
Magnun, that so many people 
could have slipped through your 
fingers without help from the 
Military. You say both the Ha* 
chovnik twins have disappeared?" 

"Yes, Leader." 

"And how many people from 
the Institute?" 

'Six, Leader, But it didn't do 
them any good. We got them, all 
right." 



"But you found no bodies ! M 
"They wouldn't have bodies 

after we got through with them, 

Leader." 

"You're quite certain, Officer 
Magnun, that all the fugitives 
were destroyed?*' 

Lanza looked tired, and his 
officers noticed in him a lack of 
firmness, an indecision, to which 
they were not accustomed in a 
Leader. 

"Say, those babies never had 
a chance, Leader. We picked up 
their roboplanes somewhere over 
Kansas, and we shot them out 
of the air like ducks. They didn't 
even fire back. They just crashed, 
burned* disintegrated. They won't 
give you any more , trouble. Why, 
we even picked up the remains 
of Doc Wong's wristwatch and 
that old beat-up pencil case of 
his." He flung them on the desk. 

Lanza fingered the charred and 
molten relics. 

"That will do, Magnun. Ill 
call you when I need you." 

"Say, ain't you feeling well, 
Leader? You look kind of green. tf 

"That will be all, Magnun V 

"As you say, Leader." 

Lanza shoved aside the charred 
remnants and spread out the 
papers waiting for him. the un- 
important, miscellaneous notes 
accumulated over the years by 
Hudson. Faure, and Haslam. 
And the unreadable notebook of 
David Wong. He sighed and

looked up as his secretary en- 
tered. 

"I'm sorry to disturb you, 
Leader. You look tired/* 

"The funeral this morning was 
quite an ordeal, and so much has 
happened the last three days!" 

"Wtfll, I thought you ought to 



know that strange reports arc 
coming in. Some of our most 
prominent citizens have disap- 
peared. We're trying to trace 
them, of course, but — " 

"Anything more?" 

"Those rumors about Blue 
Martian are cropping up again/*

GAl AX" SCIENCE FICTIO 



u Yes? And—?" 

"That old man you asked me 
to bring from the Vermont quar- 
ries, the one who was detained 
for illegal study of the Coptic 
language? Well, I guess the ex- 
citement of his release was too 
much for him. He died of a heart 
attack when he was being taken 
to the plane/* 

Lanza sighed. "Very well, that 
will be all." 

Alone at last, he looked sadly 
through the pages of David's 
notebook, at the tantalizing curls 
and angles of the Coptic letters, 
cryptic symbols of a discovery 
which prevented a man from 
growing old. Well, no one could 
read them now. That secret was 
dead, along with its discoverer, 
because, in this world, no study 
was permitted without a practical 
end in view. And perhaps it was 
just as well. Could any man be 
trusted, he wondered, to deal 
wisely with a power so great? 

After closing the notebook, he 
dropped his head into his hands. 

How his head ached! He felt 
cold, suddenly, and his whole 
body began to shake with a hard 
chill. He lifted his head, his vi- 
sion blurred, and suddenly he* 
knew. 

He had Blue Martian fever! 

Teeth chattering, he paced 
wildly about the room, puzzling 
things out, trying to remember. 
That booster shot! And then he 
realized the amazing truth; 
David Wong had given him a 
chance! He had inoculated him 
with the seeds of immortality, 
giving him a chance to help right 
the wrongs of this Categorized 
world. And now he was left alone 
in a World of mortals. David and 
the others had been annihilated, 
and he was left to live on and 
on, alone. 

He staggered toward his pri- 
vate apartments, then sank into 
his chair as his secretary once 
again ran into the room. With a 
supreme effort he controlled his 
trembling. 

"Yes?* 3 

"Leader Lanza. Another re- 
port/* 

**(Just a minute/' said Lanza, 
trying to bring his eyes into focus 
on the excited girl. "I am in need 
of a rest. As soon as you have 
gone, I shall retire into seclusion 
for a few days. There are to be 
no interruptions. Is that clear? 
Now, proceed/* 

"There's a new epidemic of 
Martian Fever reported where 
one never was before/* 

He stirred tiredly. "Where 
now?" 

"South America. Somewhere in 
the Andes/* 

"I think we'll have just one 
Category after this/' said Lanza 



dreamily. "Category Phoenix/* 
"What did you say, Leader?" 
His thoughts wandered. No 
wonder Magnun's men found no 
bodies. The planes they shot 
down were roboplanes, after all, 
and it was easy to plant in an 
empty seat a man's wristwatch 
and his bulky leather pencil case. 
David and the others were safe 
now. They were free and had 
enough time to plan for the new 
free world. 

"What did you say, Leader?" 
the girl repeated, bewildered. 

"Nothing. It doesn't matter." 
He frowned painfully, and then 
shrugged. "On second thought, I 
may be away longer than a week. 
If anyone asks for me, say I'm 
on an Aimless Tramp. I've al- 
ways hoped that some day I 
might earn the right to a Free 
Choice." 

"But you're the Leader," the 
girl said in astonishment, "You're 
entitled to all the Free Choices 
you want!" 

He lifted his twitching head, 
smiling wanly, "It would seem 
that way, wouldn't it? Well, 
whether I am or not, I think I've 
really earned a Free Choice. I 
wonder," he said in a wistful 
voice, "whether the climate in 
the Andes is hospitable."
