Wheels Within By CHARLES DE VET 


WHEN did the headaches first start?" 
asked the neurologist, Dr. Hall. 

"About six months ago," Bennett replied. 

"What is your occupation, Mr. 
Bennett?" 

"I am a contractor.' 

"Are you happy in your work ?" 

"Very. I prefer it to any other 
occupation I know of." 

"When your headaches become 
sufficiently severe, you say that 
you have hallucinations," Hall 
said. "Can you describe what 
you see during those hallucina- 
tions?" 

"At first I had only the im- 
pression that I was in a place 
completely unlike anything I had 
ever known,' Bennett answered. 
"But each time my impressions 
became sharper, and I carried 
a fairly clear picture when my 
mind returned to normal the last 
time. I felt then that I had been 
in a room in a tall building that 
towered thousands of feet over a 
great city. I even remembered 
that the name of the city was 
Thone. There were other people 
in the room with me — one person 
especially. I remembered her very 
clearly," 

"Her?" Hall asked. 

"Yes." 

"Was there anything unusual 
about this woman?" 

"Well, yes, there was," Bennett 
said, after a brief and almost 
embarrassed pause. "This will 

sound pretty adolescent, but — n 

Hall leaned forward attentively. 
"It may be relevant, You're not 
here to be judged, you know; I'm 
trying to help you." 

Bennett nodded and spoke 
rapidly, as though trying to fin- 
ish before he could stop himself. 
"She was a woman who exactly 
fitted an image I've had in mind 
for as long as I can remember. 
She was tall, fair — though bru- 
nette — very beautiful, very vivid, 
very well poised. I seem to have 
known her all my life, but only 
in my dreams, from my very 
earliest ones to the present. She's 
never changed in all that time." 

He halted as suddenly as he 
had begun to talk, either having 
nothing more to say, or unwilling 
to say it. 

"Have you ever married, Mr. 
Bennett?" Hall prodded gently. 

"No, I never have/' Again, 
Bennett stopped, adding nothing 
more to his blunt answer. 

"May I ask why not?" 

Bennett turned his face away. 
I was hoping you wouldn't ask 
that. It makes me sound like a 
romantic kid." He looked at the 
doctor almost in defiance. "I've 
always felt that some day I would 
meet this girl, or at least someone 
very much like her. I know it's 
not a rational feeling — maybe I've 
even used it as an excuse not 
to get married — but it's like spill- 
ing salt and throwing a pinch 
over our shoulder; we aren't 
superstitious, yet we don't take 
any chances." 

Dr. Hall didn't comment. He 
ended the questioning period and 
put Bennett through a series of 
tests. Then they sat down again 
and Hall offered his diagnosis. 

"The neurological examination 
is essentially negative, Mr. Ben- 
nett. In other words, there is no 
organic reason that I can find 
for your headaches. That leaves 
only one other possibility — an 
emotional disturbance. I'm a 
neurologist, remember, not a psy- 
choanalyst. I can only give an 
opinion about the cause of your 
complaint." 

Bennett waited expectantly. 

"Headaches without organic 
causes are generally the result of 
repressed anger," Hall went on. 
"That anger can stem from any 
number of traumatic situations 
or attitudes, all deeply buried in 
the unconscious, of course, or 
they would not have the power 

to hurt us. From what we know 
of you, however, it seems to be 
the result of frustration. In other 
words, you have created a fantasy 
image of a completely unattain- 
able woman, and therefore none 
of the women you meet can ful- 
fil! your expectations. Since she 
is unattainable, you naturally feel 
a sense of frustration." 

"But who could she be?" Bennett asked anxiously. 

"Someone you knew in childhood, perhaps. A composite of 
real and imaginary women. Usu- 
ally, it is an idealized image of 
your own mother." 

Bennett sat frowning. "All 
right, let's say that's so. But 
where do the hallucinations of 
the city of Thone fit in?" 

"This is something that has 
to be tracked down in a series of 
analytical sessions, so all I can 
do is guess. If one is unable to 
reach a goal in a real environ- 
ment, the obvious answer is to 
create a fantasy world. That's 
what you appear to be doing. It's 
a dangerous situation. Mr. Ben- 
nett. Potentially, at least." 

"How so?" Bennett asked, 
alarmed. 

"The general tendency is to- 
ward greater and greater divorce- 
ment from reality. I suggest 
immediate treatment by a com- 
petent analyst. If you don't know 
of one, I can recommend several.' 
"i'd like to think it over."" 


"Do that," Hall said. "And 
call me when you've decided,** 

THE third day after he con- 
sulted the neurologist, Ben- 
nett's headache returned. As be- 
fore, drugs were of no help. When 
the pain became blinding, he lay 
back on his bed, placed a cold 

* 

cloth on his forehead, and closed 
his eyes. 

Suddenly the realities he knew 
were gone and he was back in 
the dream-city of Thone. 

Persons and objects were much 
clearer now. Bennett saw that he 
lay in a receptacle shaped like a 
rectangular metal box. It was 
padded, reminding him unpleas- 
antly of a coffin. The woman he 
had seen before was again with 
him, but now he knew that her 
name was Lima. Behind her 
stood a man; a tall, dark man 
whose eyebrows joined over the 
bridge of his nose, and whose 
forehead was creased in a per- 
manent frown. The woman held 
out her arms to Bennett. Her lips 
moved, but no sound came from 
them. 

Bennett's spirit seemed to rise 
from the flesh — he could see his 
body still lying there — and he 
followed the woman. As he ap- 
proached she retreated and, try 
as he would to reach her, she re- 
mained just beyond fyis grasp. 

After what seemed hours of 
futile pursuit, a cloud formed be- 



60 




 



tween him and the woman. When 
it dissipated, he had left the 
world of Thone. He was in a 
trolley-bus, in his own world* and 
vaguely he recalled having left 
his room, gone down to the street, 
and boarded the trolley — during 
the time he had followed Lima, 
in his hallucination. It seemed 

that he had a definite destination 
then, but now he could not recall 
what it had been. 

His attention was drawn to the 
outside by the flickering of lights 
that flashed in through the bus 
windows. Bennett looked out and 
saw that he was in the Pleasure 
Section of the city, traveling 
through the Street of Carnivals. 
He watched the fronts of the 
amusement buildings pass before 
him and he read their advertise- 
ments listlessly. 

Suddenly one sign seemed to 
spring out from all the others: 

LIMA 
MYSTIC OF THE MIND 

He left the trolley at the next 
corner and made his way through 
the crowd to the brightly lit car- 
nival building. 

Inside, he found a chair and 
seated himself. The show's act 
appeared about half over. It was 
pretty evidently charlatan stuff, 
Bennett decided, but the black- 
hooded mystic on the stage held 
his attention. She was a tall 



woman, with a slender figure and 
fair flesh. She was poised, or per- 
haps it was indifference to the 
crowd. 

A runner went through the au- 
dience touching articles of cloth- 
ing or ornaments, and the woman 
without hesitation named each 
one he touched. The act was 
slightly different from most Ben- 
nett had seen in that the runner 
said nothing, merely touching the 
articles to be named. 

The next portion of the show 
consisted of a mind -reading act. 
Bennett expected the usual rou- 
tine of writing a question on 
paper, which would be sealed in 
an envelope and placed in a con- 
tainer on the stage. 

He was surprised when the 
runner returned to the crowd and 
asked for volunteers for thought- 
reading. 

A short!* man with a bright 
yellow necktie raised his hand. 
The runner made his way through 
the crowd to the man and touched 
him on the shoulder before turn- 
ing back to the mystic. He still 
said nothing, 

"This man is thinking that he 
should have stayed at home to- 
night," the mystic said. "There 
are wrestling matches on the tele- 
tone, and he would have enjoyed 
them more than this show. Be- 
sides, he would have spent less 
money that way than he has 
tonight. And he does not like to 
spend money unless he must. 

A titter of amusement went 
through the crowd as the man 
blushed a dull crimson. 

The runner touched a second 
man. 

"This man wishes to know the 
winner in the eighth race at the 
horse tracks tomorrow," she said, 
"I am sorry, but, because of Pub- 
lic Law one thousand thirty-two, 
Section five-A, I am prohibited 
from answering a question of 
that nature.'

The third person contacted was 
a woman. She raised her hand, 
then half changed her mind when 
she saw that the runner was 
turning toward her. But then she 
defiantly tossed her brown hair 
ba#k from her face and allowed 
him to touch her shoulder. 

"This woman is wondering if 
her lover is true to her — and if 
her husband will find out about 
them." 

This time the crowd laughed 
when the embarrassed woman 
turned pale and rushed up the 
aisle toward the exit. 

No further hands were raised 
and the show ended with a short 
address by the runner: "I hope 
you have enjoyed these truly mar- 
velous and mysterious demon- 
strations. Now the mystic, Lima, 
is available for a short time for 
personal interviews. The fee is 
very reasonable — one dollar a 
minute. Anyone wislyng an inter- 



view please step forward.** 

The mystic pulled the hood 

from her head, smiled, bowed at 

the crowd, and left the stage. 
Bennett gasped. 
"The -woman of the city of 

Thone!" 

"VOU have paid in advance for 
-*- twenty-five minutes of my 
time/' Lima said, as she smiled in 
amusement. "Perhaps you had 
better begin your questions, in- 
stead of merely staring at me.** 

Bennett brought his thoughts 
back with an effort. "Your 
performance was exceptionally 
good," he said very soberly. "I 
enjoyed it. And so, apparently 
did the other customers. It is a 
clever routine. 1*11 admit I an*t 
figure out how you do it* 

"Remember what Barnum said,** 
Lima replied lightly. 

"At least you do not take your- 
self too seriously/* Bennett ob- 
served. 

"On the contrary," Lima coun- 
tered, "I take myself very seri- 
ously. You, however, do not. You 
are paying for my time and the 
customer is always right.** 

"Tell me," Bennett asked 
abruptly, "have we ever met be- 
fore?" 

m 

"Not to my knowledge.** 
"Have you any objections to 
telling me about yourself during 
our interview? Who are you? 
What is your background?"

"I will be glad to tell you about 
myself, if you think it will be 
interesting," she replied, after a 
barely perceptible pause. "How I 
came by this exceptional ability 
of mine, I have no slightest con- 
ception. I only remember that 
when I was young, and still with- 
out the intellect to evaluate social 
mores and customs, I was often 
placed in positions of awkward- 
ness by my ability to read minds. 
At an early age, however, through 
the council of my parents, I 
learned to keep this knowledge to 
myself. 

"By the time I reached my 
twentieth birthday, my parents 
were both dead and I was alone 
in the world. I had never learned 
any occupation. I made some at- 
tempts to use my mind -reading 
to some advantage to myself, but 
soon found that I encountered 
the opposition of the medical as- 
sociations as well as the law. As 
a consequence, I turned to show 
business as the one means of 
earning a legitimate livelihood. 
There is not much more to tell." 

"Can you actually read 
minds?" Bennett asked insistently. 

"I can." 

"Then what am I thinking 
now?" 

"You are thinking," Lima said, 
with no semblance of a trance 
or any of the other usual antics 
of professional mystics, "that I 
look exactly like a woman you 



have never seen, but whose image 
you have carried in your mind 
since your childhood." 

For just a moment, the star- 
tling accuracy disconcerted Ben- 
nett, 

"I have a problem which is 
quite annoying," he pushed on 
almost frantically. "Can you tell 
me what my problem is?" 

"You have been subject to ex- 
tremely severe headaches, which 
you have been unable to remedy, 
either by sedatives or with the 
help of a neurologist. Am I cor- 
rect?" 

"More than you could possibly 
know! Look, I came here believ- 
ing you were a fake. That didn't 
matter — it was the fact that you 
looked like this other woman that 
counted. I'm convinced now- I 
want your help. Can you help me, 
or at least tell me whether the 
neurologist is right about the 
cause of my headaches?" 

"He is wrong," Lima said. "I 
can tell you what causes them, 
but I am afraid that I will have 
to ask for another hundred dol- 
lars for that extra service." 

Bennett was momentarily irri- 
tated at this evidence that theif 
relationship, at least as far as she 
was concerned, was strictly busi- 
ness. But he shrugged off the 
feeling. He drew five twenty- 
dollar bills from his pocketbook 
and placed them on the table be- 
fore her.

"If you remember/' Lima said, 
folding the money carefully and 
tucking it into the neck of her 
dress, "five months ago a build- 
ing which you had contracted to 
build fell, when it was nearly 
completed, and two workmen 

were killed," 

"I remember very well/* 

"You found that the collapse 
of the building was caused by 
faulty material which you had 
bought through a subcontractor. 
You are still investigating to de- 
termine where to place the blame, 
and are on the point of doing so." 

"Go on," Bennett breathed 
softly. 

"You are quite certain that the 
person responsible is John Tour- 
na* ostensibly a reputable 
contractor, but actually an un- 
scrupulous scoundrel. You have 
a choice of exposing him, with 
great personal danger to yourself 
— Tournay is a dangerous and 
ruthless man — or remaining silent 
and knowing that you are a 
coward. The difficulty of that 
choice is causing your head* 
aches.** 

"You may be right," Bennett 
admitted without hesitation. **I 
haven't had time to think the 
matter through quite that far. 
What would you advise me to 
do?" 

"That is something which can- 
not be advised. The answer lies 
within yourself. You are either 



a big enough man to do the right 
thing — which you yourself rec- 
ognize — or you are a small man 
and will take the safer, less hon- 
orable course. The decision and 
the integrity lie within yourself." 

BENNETT slumped. "I see 
that. Then there's nothing 
more that you can do for me?" 
"But there is," Lima replied. "I 
can cure your headaches, if you 

wish — for an additional hundred 
dollars." 

"That would be a cheap price." 
Bt nett drew his wallet from his 
pocket. "My cash is rather low. 
Would you accept a personal 
check?" 

"Certainly," Lima said. "But, 
first, let me explain about my 
cure. There is some mental un- 
pleasantness involved which you 
may consider worse than the ail- 
ment," 

"I doubt that. L can't imagine 
anything worse than this agony." 

"Your mind will be placed un- 
der my control and led through 
a dream sequence. I will follow 
a logical progression of events, 
using your actual past as back- 
ground. While you are under my 
control, your experiences will be 
far from pleasant. I will allow 
your mind to follow its own an- 
ticipated course of events, influ- 
encing your thoughts only slightly 
— directing them into as un- 
pleasant channels as possible. In

fact, to make the cure certain, 
at least the culmination must be 
quite devastating. Do you agree 
to undergo such rigorous mental 
punishment?" 

"But why do I have to?" Ben- 
nett 'asked, astonished and wor- 
ried. 

"That pattern will act in the 
manner of a counter-irritant. 
Your mind is like a spoiled child, 
rejecting anticipated unpleasant- 
ness. Under my influence it is 
rubjected to possible alternative 
experiences, which are so much 
worse than the one it originally 
feared that it will gratefully ac- 
cept the lesser evil," 

"That sounds reasonable," 
Bennett agreed- "When could we 
begin this treatment?" 

"Immediately, if you are will-

ing. 

"I see no reason for waiting." 
"Then, if you are ready," Lima 
told him, "lie on this couch. Keep 
your eyes on mine." She spoke 
slowly, evenly. "Remember that 
you are doing this of your own 
free will, that you trust me. I 
am your friend and would do you 
no harm." 

Her voice droned on as Bennett 
looked into her eyes. They 
merged until they became one 
large, placid pool of restfulness, 
and he found himself drawn into 
them. 

He sank peacefully, quietly— 
completely. 



WHEN the telephone rang, 
Bennett knew it was the dis- 
trict attorney returning his call, 
and that the die was cast. Until 
this ugly business was brought to 
a conclusion, his life would be ill 
constant danger. 

"Leroy Bennett speaking," he 
said. "I have had collected some 
information that I think will be 
of very great interest to your 
office." 

"Information about what?" the 
voice at the other end asked 
briskly. 

"I have proof that John Tour- 
nay is responsible for the death 
of two men, in an action involv- 
ing criminal collusion." 

"If what you say is true, I 
will be glad to see your evidence, 11 
the district attorney said. "Could 
you deliver it in person? There 
may be some questions I would 
like to ask you about it." 

"Certainly," Bennett replied, 
"When would be the most con- 
venient time?" 

"Later in the day. I have a 
case going on. How would four- 
thirty this afternoon suit you?" 

"That would be fine," 

The rest of the day dragged 
slowly. At four o'clock Bennett 
left his office and took the ele- 
vator to the ground floor. Under 
his arm he clutched the briefcase 
which might spell death for him. 

A moment after he left his of- 
fice building, he knew he had

made a mistake — a fatal one! 

Idly, at first, his mind's eye 
watched the driver of a long gray 
sedan, parked at the curb, start 
up its motor as he approached. 
The car pulled away from the 
curb when he came alongside it. 

Through an open rear window, 
Bennett saw a man with a dark, 
brooding face — with black eye- 
brows that joined over the bridge 
of the nose — glowering at him. At 
the same instant he saw the blunt 
nose of an automatic resting on 
the lowered glass of the window, 
just below the chin of the frown- 
ing man. 

Incredibly, even as he realized 
that he was about to die, Ben- 
nett's first thought was not one 
of Tear, but rather that this dark 
man was the other person he had 
seen in his hallucinations of the 
city of Thone! 

Then, as one part of his mind 
drew back in terror at what it 
knew was about to happen, an- 
other part wondered at the mys- 
tery of Thone and the people in 
it. Where did that hallucination 
fit in this mist of life which was 
about to ecid? 

He felt three hard, solid blows 
punch shockingly into his body. 
There was pain, but greater than 
that was the terror that whipped 
his panicked mind. 

"Lima/* Bennett whispered 
with his last stark thought as he 
dropped to his knees. 



He groped for the sidewalk 

with one hand, to steady himself, 
and never reached it. 

"IT'S over now/* Bennett heard 
■■■ the mystic say, "Please try 
to relax." 

He found himself fighting with 
awful exertion to raise himself 
from the sidewalk — which had 
turned into a couch. His clothes 
clung to him with a clammy wet- 
ness that chilled him. 

He flung his arms out in a 
frantic gesture that knocked a 
lamp from an end-table and sent 
it crashing to the floor. 

Not until then did he feel the 
mystic's firmly gentle hands on 
his shoulders, urging him down, 
and know that he was not actu- 
ally dying. He lay back for a 
moment, gasping great gulps of 
welcome air into his lungs, 

"I think you will be all right 
now," Lima said. 

"You were right when you said 
the experience would not be 
pleasant," Bennett said, still bat- 
tling for breath. "I hope the re- 
sults will be worth it.'* 

"I believe you will find that 
they are/* Lima told him reassur- 
ingly. "Also, it can be of assist- 
ance to you in still another way* 
The sequence your dream fol- 
lowed— ^being a natural, perhaps 
even a probable, aftermath of 
your past decisions and move- 
ments — could actually happen. 



*i 




 



Therefore it would be wise to it turned to the mystic for help, 
avoid such decisions in real life.** •'Lima!*' he called desperately. 



A T the end erf two weeks, Ren- 
-*^ nett had collected all the 
information he needed on Tour- 
nay's illegal activities. The inves- 
tigator he hired was very 
thorough, and unearthed several 
other incriminating schemes in 
Tournay's past. With the'evidenee 
he had on hand, Bennett was cer- 
tain that Tournay would be con- 
victed in any court. 

This time he intended to evade 
the fate he had suffered in the 
dream by acting differently. He 
hired a shrewd lawyer — the best 
obtainable — had him draw up 
the evidence in legal form, and 
presented it to the district at- 
torney, with the demand for 
Tournay's immediate arrest. He 
knew that immediate action 

■ 

would be his best protection. 

That evening, when he left his 
office building, he felt the peace 
of a man whose task has been 
well done. 

It took almost a full second be- 
fore the sight of the long gray 
car jerked his thoughts from their 
pleasant introspection and back 
to dread reality. Tournay's black- 
browed face leered at him as it 
had in the dream and he felt 
his body tense as it waited for 
the pistol slugs to strike. 

His mind scurried in its trap 
within his head and, strangely, 



A GAIN Bennett felt himself 
■**• struggling with that awful 
exertion to drag his body from 
the couch on which it lay. 

"It's all over now/' he heard 
Lima say. 

He sat up. "What happened ? H 

"This will be hard to believe," 
Lima said, "and I will not try to 
prove it to you, but it is true. The 
mind has many powers which 
cannot even be imagined by any- 
one*who has not lived with those 
powers as I have. When you 
called me, your mind attuned it- 
self with mine, and its need and 
its demand were so powerful that 
together we turned time back- 
ward. You are now back in my 
dressing room, and it is the exact 
time at which you originally 
came out of your dream. n 

"That's impossible !" Bennett 
protested. 

"Nevertheless, it happened. I 
only ask you to keep in mind one 
thing. Someday, when your mind 
has been made more facile, you 
will understand how I am able 
to do this. It will even appear 
logical to you. Now, however, 
the only thing I can tell you is 
believe it! 9 * 

"DENNETT had no intention of

After he had collected the infor-

mation about Toumay f s criminal 
activities, he also dug into his 
past for a man who had cause to 
hate the contractor. He found the 
man he sought, a man as ruth- 
less and unscrupulous as Tour nay 
himself, one who could light him 
on his own ground. 

Roger Clarkson had been the 
controller of a string of bookie 
joints, before he had been framed 
by Tournay, and convicted, to 
serve ten years in prison. 

Clarkson had been released 
from prison six days before. He 
found that Tournay had gained 
control of his former criminal em- 
pire. Everyone, including Tour- 
nay, knew that the only thing 
preventing Clarkson from taking 
re^fenge was the opportunity. 

Bennett sent his information to 
Clarkson and sat back to await 
the results. That evening, as he 
was about to leave his office 
building, some inner caution 
warned him to take no chances. 
He stepped cautiously out into 
the street, looked both ways for 
the gray sedan, and saw that the 
street was empty, before he 
walked to the corner. 

He arrived there just in time 
to meet the long gray sedan as it 
drove up. 

ONCE more he fought the aw- 
ful exertion on the mystic's 
couch. This time he came out of 
the blackness with his mind clear. 



"You've saved me again/' he said 
to Lima. "Have you turned time 
backward again?" 

"Yes," she replied. "But I have 
given you all the help I can. The 
next attempt you make, you will 
have nothing on which to lean 
except your own strength." 

"But why do I always arrive 
at the point where I'm being shot 
by Tournay, regardless of what 
course I choose? Is there no way 
I can beat him?" 

"If you believe in fate as 
strongly as I do, you will accept 
that conclusion as inevitable. The 
long gray sedan is the symbol of 
your death. You cannot avoid it 
— at least not as long as you per- 
sist in passive action." 

"What do you mean by that?" 

"Just this. You wish to see 
Tournay punished — your sense of 
justice demands it. But each time 
you try to have someone else ad- 
minister that punishment. It 
appears to me that the only 
possibility of your breaking this 
fateful progression of events is 
for you to administer the punish- 
ment yourself. You probably re- 
alize the danger of trying that* 
But I can't see where you have 
any other choice." 

"In other words, you feel that 
the only chance I have of pre- 
venting Tournay from killing me 
—is to kill him first?" 

"Yes," Lima said. "Are you 
strong and hard enough to do it?"

Bennett thought for only a 
brief moment before he nodded. 
m Ym desperate enough, at any 
rate/ ' 

This time he did not leave im- 
mediately. He had to find out 
something first. He put his arms 
around Lima's shoulders and 
drew her toward him. She put 
her face up and he kissed her 
waiting lips. They were sweet 
and, if she did not return the ar- 
dor of his kiss, he did not no- 
tice it.

R. Tournay is not in," the 
girl at the desk told Ben- 
nett. "You might try his home." 

At a pay booth in the lobby, 
Bennett called Tournay's home. 
The voice that answered was that 
of a tired woman, one who has 
given up hope. "Mr. Tournay 
called me a short time ago and 
said that he would be in the 
office of a Mr. Leroy Bennett, in 
the Lowry building, if anyone 
called," the tired voice said. 

Bennett hung up and caught 
a cab. His Quarry had walked 
into an ideal place for their meet- 
ing. For better or for worse, he 
would soon bring this conflict to 
an end. 

In his office, Bennett found that 
Tournay had been there and gone. 
He had left a message: "Tell 
Mr. Bennett that Lima sent me!" 

So that was it — Lima had used 
Bennett as a dupe! He could not 



figure out her purpose, but he 
knew that he could never trust 
her again. She had been against 
him from the first. Perhaps even 
she, rather than Tournay, was the 
prime menace. He decided that 
he must kill them both, before 
they had the chance to kill him. 
Touching the small flat pistol 
snuggling in its shoulder holster, 
he knew the pursuit must con- 
tinue immediately. 

He rode the elevator to the 
ground floor, and he felt his mind 
working with a clarity and a 
precision which he had seldom 
experienced before. This time he 
knew he would win. 

Shrewdly, before leaving the 
building, Bennett looked out 
through the glass pane in the 
door first. He waited only a mo- 
ment before he saw the long 
gray sedan as he had expected. 
They would not trap him again. 
Ducking back, he walked rapidly 
toward a side exit. 

Night had fallen by the time 
he reached the carnival building. 
He did not ring the bell. In- 
stead, he walked to the rear, 
climbed the stairs of a fire-escape, 
and softly opened the window of 
a bedroom. 

He stepped inside just as softly 
and stood listening for breathing. 
He heard none. This was prob- 
ably too early for Lima to be in 
bed. 

The bedroom door was open.

Bennett could see a light coming 
from another part of the apart- 
ment — probably the living room- 
He paused to steel himself for 
what he must do. The time had 
come when he would have to be 
savagely ruthless. 

He found Lima sitting on a 
couch, reading a book. He sus- 
pected that she still had some 
control over his mind and he had 
no intention of letting her influ- 
ence him. She must be killed be- 
fore she could read his intention. 

"It didn't work." Bennett spoke 
just loudly enough to startle 
Lima into raising her head. 

As she looked up, he shot her 
squarely between the eyes. 

In an agony of frustration, 
Bemett saw the flesh of her fore- 
head remain clear and undis- 
turbed. He knew he could not 
miss at this range, yet she was 
unhurt. He lowered his sights and 
shot at the white neck beneath 
the fair head. She still sat there, 
returning his gaze, unperturbed, 
unmarked by the bullets. 

He pumped the four remaining 
bullets into her body. The only 
part of her that moved was her 
lips. 

"It's no use, Leroy," she said. 
"Haven't you guessed? You are 
still in your dream. You can't 
kill me there." 

Suddenly the implication struck 
him with its awful simplicity. 

"Good God!" His voice rose. 



a 



Do you mean I've never been 
out of my dream?" He hesitated 
while the thought sank in. "My 
remembrance of coming out of 
it was only part of the dream it- 
self/* he murmured. "That was 
why you were able to turn time 
backward at will." 

A cold calmness returned to 
him. 

"Tell me," he said, "am I still 
in the dream?" 

"Yes," Lima replied. 

"Then I demand that you free 
me now!" 

"As you wish," Lima said 
sadly. "And may God help you." 

Bennett wrenched his body 
from the couch on which it lay 
and struggled to his feet. Though 
the dream had seemed real 
enough, he could look back on 
it now and see it as any other 
dream. 

He breathed easier, and then 
stopped abruptly when he heard 
a voice behind him say, "You 
are still a dead man!" 

Bennett whirled and found 
himself facing Tournay. And 
Tournay held a pistol aimed at 
his heart. 

Bennettturned desperately back 
to Lima. His lips formed her 
name, but the sound died almost 
before it was uttered. This time, 
he saw, she would not help him. 
Her features had hardened and 
no mercy or compassion regis- 
tered on them.

"There is no escape,** she said, 

A fleeting thought went through 
his mind of springing at Tour- 
nay and trying to reach him be- 
fore the gun could be fired. But 
one glance at Toumay's face 
made him realize how futile — -and 
fatal — that would be, 

Tournay's finger tightened on 
the trigger of his gun and Bennett 
thought ahead in despair to what 
was to come. One thing he knew: 
He did not want to die! Was 
there no way out? 

The answer came like a cry of 
relief. There was a way — Thone! 
The city of his enigma. Tournay 
av 1 Lima could not harm him 
there. 

FOR just an instant, Bennett's 
vision blurred. Time paused, 
and the next moment he knew 
he had returned to Thone. The 
sounds of the alien city floated 
up to him and he stirred. 

He grasped the sides of his 
coffinlike bed with fingers that 
had lost their sense of touch. He 
pulled himself up to a sitting po- 
sition and looked about him. On 
one side stood Lima, though now 
her features were not those of 
the implacable, merciless mystic, 
but rather those of a woman in 
love. 

She smiled happily and said, 
**At last you have returned." 

Bennett strove to move his 
tongue and lips to ask questions, 



n 



but they refused, as though 
numbed by long inaction. He 
turned to his other side and gazed 
questioningly at the replica of 
Tournay who stood there. 

Tournay's image spoke. "We 
had quite a time bringing you 
back, Sire. But now it has been 
accomplished — for good," 

Striving to move his throat 
muscles, Bennett finally forced 
a sound, and then words, through 

his lips. 

"Tell me," he pleaded, "Who 
are you? And, more important, 

who am I?" 

He turned to Lima for an an- 
swer, realizing that now she 
would help him if anyone would. 

"Doctor Tournay will explain 
it to you," Lima replied, indi- 
cating the dark man. 

Imploringly, Bennett turned 

back to face Tournay. 

"I see that very little of your 
memory has returned yet," Tour- 
nay said. "In a short while, ev- 
erything — all your past — witt 
come back to you. Until then, 
perhaps I had better explain to 
you who you are. My words will 
help trigger your returning mem- 
ory, and speed up the process." 

"Please * do," Bennett begged. 

"You are Benn Ett, Le Roy of 
the city-state of Thone, in the 
year 4526 A. D. Six months ago, 
the strain of governing the city 
began to undermine your health. 
Acting under my advice, you de- 


 









cided to take a somno -rest cure. 

"This rest cure," the doctor 
continued, "is quite standard 
practice in our time. We had a 
little difficulty bringing you out 
of it at the end of six months. 
Evidently your somno- existence 
must have been very pleasant/* 

"Do you mean that the exist- 
ence I remember was merely an 
induced figment of my imagina- 
tion?" 

"Yes. You see, the best rest 
that can be given a mind is to 
give it not sleep, but pleasant 
work. Therefore, under my ma- 
nipulation, you were given a 
pseudo-existence in a past era of 
history. You were led to conceive 
yourself as occupying a posi- 
tion, which, after close study, I 
deduced would be the most suit- 
able and relaxing for you/' 

"But if that is true, why did 
my dream have to end so un- 
pleasantly — I might say, so 
nearly fatally ?" Bennett de- 
manded. 

"The more successful I am in 
choosing a pleasant existence for 
a patient in the somno, the more 
difficult it is to bring him out of 
it/' the doctor replied. "Your un- 
conscious mind, realizing how 
happy you were in your simu- 
lated existence, and how it would 
have to return to the rigor and 



stress which unnerved it before, 
fought with all its strength to re- 
main where the somno had placed 
it 

"The usual practice in bring- 
ing a patient back to reality is 
for the doctor to enter the dream 
and convince him, by whatever 
means may be necessary, to re- 
turn. Sometimes, however, the 
patient is so firmly tied to 
his somno-existence that drastic 
measures must be used. This is 
usually done by means of making 
the somno-existence so anxiety- 
producing that the patient is glad 
to return. 

"Your particular release was 
one of the most difficult that I 
have ever encountered. In fact, I 
was unable to bring you back 
myself, and asked your wife, 
Lima, to enter the somno with me 
and help force you to return.* 

Bits of recollection, which had 
been edging into Bennett's mem- 
ory, burst through in full force, 
and he remembered. It was true. 
He was Benn Ett, Le Roy of the 
city-state of Thone. 

He turned to Lima and, as he 
read the glad light in her eyes, 
he knew that she had witnessed 
the return of his complete mem- 
ory. 

"Welcome home," she said.
