THE door-knob turned, then 
rattled. 
Dr. David Wong stepped 
out from behind the large bookcase, listening. He pressed the 
brass handle of the top shelf and 
the case silently pivoted back to 
become part of the wall, obliterating the dark passage behind it. 

An imperative knocking began 
at the door; David walked softly 
to his desk and picked up his 
notebook. He tried to remain relaxed, but he could feel the tightening of his shoulder muscles. 
With his right hand, he shut his 
notebook and concealed it under 
a mass of papers, while his left 
hand pressed the desk button to 



release th« lock of the door. 

The door burst open and two 
men strode in, a black-uniformed 
Ruler followed by a watchguard. 
Black -visored cap still on his 
head, the first man marched to 
the desk and spoke without ceremonial greeting. 

"The door was locked. Dr. 
Wong?" 

"Correct, Dr. Lanza. The door 
was locked." 

"I shall have to instruct the 
guard to report it. Have you forgotten Leader Marley's Maxim: 
Constructive science does not 
skulk behind locked doors?" 

Wong leaned back in his chair 
and smiled at his visitors.

"The wisdom of Leader Marley 
is a constant help to us all, but 
his generosity is also a byword. 
Surely you remember that on the 
tenth anniversary of his accession, he honored me by the grant 
of occasional hours of Privacy, 
as a reward for my work on Blue 
Martian Fever?" 

"I remember now/* said Dr. 
Lanza. 

"But what for?" asked Officer 
Blagun. "It's anti-social!" 

"Evidently you have forgotten. 
Officer Blagun, another Maxim 
of Leader Marley: Nature has 
not equipped one Category to 
judge the needs of another; only 
the Leader understands all. Now, 
Dr. Lanza, will you tell me the 
reason for this visit? Since your 
promotion from Research to 
Ruler, I have rarely been honored 
by your attention." 

"I am here with a message," 
said Lanza. "Leader Marley's 
compliments, and he requests 
your presence at a conference on 
next Wednesday at ten in the 
morning." 

"Why did you have to deliver 
that in person? What's wrong 
with using Communications?" 

"It's not my province to ask 
questions, Dr. Wong. I was told 
to come here, and I was told to 
wait for a reply." 

"Next Wednesday at ten? Let's 
see, this is Friday." David Wong 
pressed the key of his electronic 



calendar, but he had no need to 
study the dull green and red 
lights that flashed on to indicate 
the pattern of his day. He did 
not delude himself that he had 
any real choice, but he had 
learned in the past fifteen years 
that it kept up his courage to 
preserve at least the forms of independence. He allowed a decent 
thirty seconds to ponder the 
coded lights, then blanked the 
board and looked up with an easy 
smile. 

"Dr. Wong's compliments to 
Leader Marley, and he will be 
honored to attend a conference 
on Wednesday at ten." 

Nodding his head, Dr. Lanza 
glanced briefly around the office. 
"Queer, old-fashioned place you 
have here." 

"Yes. It was built many years 
ago by a slippery old politician 
who wanted to be safe from his 
enemies. Makes a good place for 
Research, don't you think?" 

Lanza did not answer. He 
strode to the door, then paused 
to look back. 

"You understand, Dr. Wong, 
that I shall have to report the 
locked door? I have no choice." 

"Has anyone?" 

Officer Blagun followed his 
superior, leaving the door wide 
open behind them. Wong remained rigid in his chair until 
the clack of heels on marbl? floor 
had become a mere echo in his

brain, then stretched out his hand 
to the intercom. He observed with 
pride that his hand did not tremble as he pressed the dial. 

*'Get me Dr. Karl Haslam . . . 
Karl? Can you meet me in the 
lab right away? I've thought of 
a new approach that might help 
us crack the White Martian problem. Yes, I know we planned on 
conferring tomorrow, but it's getting later than you* think." 

Again he pressed the dial. "Get 
me Leah Hachovnik. Leah? I've 
got some new stuff to dictate. Be 
a good girl and come along right 
away." 

Breaking the connection, he 
diew out his notebook and 
opened it. 

*David Wong was a big man, 
tail, well-muscled, compact, and 
he m i ght have been handsome 
but for a vague something in his 
appearance. His lean face and 
upcurving mouth were those of 
a young man; his hair was a 
glossy black, too thick to be disciplined into neatness ; and he 
was well-dressed, except for the 
unfashionable bulging of his 
jacket pocket, where he carried 
a bulky leather case of everfeed 
pens and notebooks. But it was 
his eyes that were disconcerting 
— an intense blue, brilliant and 
direct, they had a wisdom and a 
comprehension that seemed incongruous in so young a face. 
A worried frown creased his 



forehead as he turned back to one 
of the first pages, studying the 
symbols he had recorded there, 
but he looked up without expression on hearing the tapping of 
slender heels. 

"Quick work, Leah. How are 
you this morning?" 

"As if anybody cared!" Leah 
Hachovnik settled down before 
the compact stenograph machine, 
her shoulders slumped, her thin 
mouth drooping at the corners. 

"Feel like working?" said 
David. 

**As much as I ever do. I guess. 
Sometimes I wonder if the traitors in the granite quarries have 
it any worse than I do. Sometimes f wish I'd been born into 
some other Category. Other people have all the luck. I don't 
know what it is, Dr. Wong, but I 
just don't seem to have the pep 
1 used to have. Do you think it 
could be the climate here in New 
York?" 

"People do grow older, Leah,** 
he reminded her gently. 

"I know. But Tanya — you remember my twin sister Tanya, 
the one that got so sick that time, 
ten years ago, when you did that 
experiment with Blue Martian 
Fever, and she had to be sent out 
to Arizona? Of course I haven't 
ever seen her since then — people 
in Office Category never get permission for that kind of travelbut she writes me that ever since 



* 




 



she got well again she feels just 
like a kid, and works as hard as 
she ever did, and she still seems 
to enjoy life. Why, she's had three 
proposals of marriage this past 
year alone, she says, and yet she's 
thirty-five, just the same age as I 
am — being twins, you know? — ■ 
aiicl nobody's proposed to me in 
ages. Well, I'm certainly going 
to try to find out what her 
method is. She's coming back 
tomorrow.'* 
"She's what?" 

"Coming back. BureauMed is 
sending her back here to the Institute to take up her old job in 
Intercom. Funny they haven't 
told you, her being an old employee and all." 

Dr. Wong was gripping his 
notebook in/ stiff fingers, but he 
replied easily, "Oh, well, BureauMed is a complex organization. 
With all they have to do, it's not 
surprising they get things mixed 
up sometimes." 

"Don't I know!" she sighed, 
and droned on in a dreary monotone. "This one institute alone 
would turn your hair gray before 
your time. I don't know how 
some people seem to keep so 
young. I was just 'thinking to 
myself this morning when I 
watched you walking through the 
office. 'Why, Dr. Wong doesn't 
seem to age a bit! He looks just 
as young as he ever did, and look 
at me!' " 



Looking at her, David admitted to himself," was not the pleasure it had once been. Ten years 
ago, she and her twin sister 
Tanya had been plump, delectable, kittenish girls, their mental 
equipment no more than standard 
for Office Category, of course, 
but their physical appearance had 
been outstanding, almost beautiful enough for Theater Category. 
Creamy ivory skin, gray eyes, 
and soft red hair dramatized by 
a freakish streak of white that 
shot abruptly back from the center of the forehead, Tanya's 
swirling to the left, and Leah's to 
the right, one girl the mirror image of the other. 

But the Leah sitting before him 
now was thin and tired-looking, 
her sallow skin was lined, and 
her soft voice had become vinegary with disappointments. Her 
red hair had faded to a commonplace brown, and the white streak 
in the center was yellowed. An 
unwanted, souring old maid. But 
there was only one response to 
make. 

"You look fine to me, Leah," 
he said. "What time did you say 
your sister is coming?" 

"Tomorrow evenings' Playground Jet. Why?" 

"We'll have to think of a way 
to celebrate. But right now. I'd 
like to get started on my new 
paper. I've got to meet Dr. Haslam before long."

"I know." She raised her faded 
gray eyes. "That was a funny 
thing you said to him just now 
over the intercom. You said to 
him it was getting late. But it 
isn't late. It's only eleven o'clock 
in the morning." 

David stared. "Do you mean 
to say you were listening to our 
conversation? Why did you do 
that?*' 

She fidgeted and turned away 
from him. *'Oh. I just happened 
to be at Comdesk and I guess 
the circuit wasn't closed. Does it 
matter? But it seemed a funny 
thing for you to say." 

"People in Office Category are 
not supposed to understand Research," he said severely. "If they 
were capable of Research. Leader 
Ivfarley's planners would have 
placed them there. As for its being late, it is, as far as White 
Martian Fever is concerned. 
Which is the subject of my paper. 
Prepare to take dictation." 

Shrugging her shoulders, she 
poised her bony fingers over the 
keys of the little machine. 

"Paper for delivery at the Summer Seminar," he began. 

"But, Dr. Wong, that doesn't 
have to be ready for three months 
yet!" 

"Miss Hachovnik! Please remember Leader Marley's Maxim : 
Individuals born into Office Category are the bone and muscle of 
the State: Nature has designed 



them to act, not to think." 

"Yes. Dr. Wong. I'm sorry." 

"Don't worry, Leah. We're old 
friends, so I won't report you. 
All set?" 

He took a pencil from his 
leather case and tapped it against 
his notebook as he ruffled the 
pages, wondering how to begin. 
It was hard to think logically 
when a part of his mind was in 
such confusion. Had Leah been 
listening in to all of his phone 
conversations? If so. it was fortunate that he had long ago devised an emergency code. Was it 
only idle curiosity that had 
prompted her or was she acting 
under orders? Was anyone else 
watching him, he wondered, 
listening to his talk, perhaps even 
checking the routine of his experimental work? There was 
Lanza this morning — why had he 
come unannounced, in persori, 
when a Communications call 
would have served the purpose 
equally wetl? 

Leah's voice broke in. "I'm 
ready. Dr. Wong." 

He cleared his throat. ". . . the 
Summer Seminar. Title: The 
Propogation of White Martian 
virus. Paragraph. It will be remembered that the early attempts to establish Earth colonies 
on Mars were frustrated by the 
extreme susceptibility of our people to two viruses native to the 
foreign planet, viruses which we 



a 




 



designate as Blue Martian and 
White Martian, according to the 
two distinct types of fever which 
they cause. Blue Martian Fever 
in the early days caused a mortality among our colonists of 
nearly eighty-five per cent, and 
made the establishment of permanent colonies a virtual impossibility. 

"Under the inspired leadership 
of Leader Marley and with the 
advice of his deputy Dr. Lanza, 
this laboratory in Research 
worked out a method of growing 
the virus and producing an immunizing agent which is effective 
in nearly all human beings. Only 
the cooperation of several Categories made possible such a feat. 
It will not be forgotten that even 
the humblest helpers in the Institute had their share in the 
project, that some of them acted 
as human volunteers in the experiments, well knowing the risks 
they ran, and were afterward rewarded by a Free Choice. 

"One person in Office Category, 
for instance, was given the privilege of learning to play the flute, 
although nobody in his family 
had ever belonged to Music, and 
another person in Menial Category was permitted a month's 
study of elementary algebra, a 
nearly unheard of indulgence for 
a person in his position. But as 
Leader Marley so graciously remarked in conferring the awards; 



To the individual who risks 
much, the State gives much." 

"Like me and Tanya?" the 
girl asked, stopping her typing. 

"Yes, like you and Tanya. You 
were allowed to act a part in an 
amateur Theater group, I remember, and since Tanya was 
made too ill to be able to use a 
Free Choice, she was sent out 
west to the Playground, just as 
though she had belonged to Ruler 
Category. Now where was I?" 

" 'The State gives much.' " 

"Oh, yes. Paragraph. Since the 
discovery of the immunizing 
mechanism to Blue Martian, permanent colonies have been established on Mars. But there remains 
the more elusive problem of 
White Martian Fever, which, 
though its mortality is only thirty 
per cent, is still so crippling to 
those victims who survive that 
the Martian colonies cannot begin to expand, and the resources 
of the planet cannot be fully 
developed, until an immunizing 
agent is found. 

"For the past eight years this 
laboratory has been working at 
the problem, among others, and 
we are now in a position to report 
a small degree of progress. Since 
it proved to be impossible to 
grow the virus in the usual media, 
it occurred to us — " 

The intercom buzzed, and Dr. 
Wong turned away to open the 
dial.

"David? What's happened to 
you? I've been waiting here in 
the lab a quarter of an hour." 

"Sorry, Karl. I thought I had 
more time. Re right down." 

He reached for his white lab 
coat and shoved his long arms 
into the starched sleeves. "That's 
all we have time for now, Leah. 
Can you get an early lunch and 
be back here this afternoon at 
two?" 

But she was. not listening. She 
was leaning over to look at the 
desk, staring avidly at the open 
pages of Dr. Wong's notebook. 
Without comment he picked up 
the book, closed it, put it in the 
top drawer and locked the drawer. 
She watched him with curious 
eyes. 

*What funny marks those were. 
Dr. Wong! Do you keep your 
notes in a private system of shorthand?" 

"No. I write them in Coptic. 
For the sake of privacy." 

"What's Coptic?" 

"A dead language, spoken by 
the ancient Egyptians thirty or 
forty centuries ago." 

"But you're Research, not Linguistics! It's against the law for 
you to know other languages. 
Are you a traitor?" 

"My dear Leah," he said, "I'm 
far too sensible a man to go in 
for bootleg study, to learn anything without permission. I have 
no wish to end up with a pick-ax 



in my hands. But you shouldn't 
tax your little mind with thinking. It's not your job. You're not 
equipped for it, and it's dangerous." 

DAVID passed the watchguard 
stationed in the basement 
corridor, walked through the 
open door of the laboratory, past 
the bench where a row of pretty 
technicians sat making serial dilutions of bacterial and virus suspensions, through the glow of the 
sterilizing room, and on into the 
small inner 1ab where flasks of 
culture media and developing 
hens' eggs sat in a transparent incubator, and petri dishes flecked 
with spots of color awaited his 
inspection. 

Dr. Karl Haslam was standing 
at the work bench, with a pair 
of silver forceps which held a 
small egg under the psi light. 
Gently he lowered the egg into 
its warm observation chamber, 
covered the container, and sat 
down. 

"Well, here I am. What^s gone 
wrong? Explain yourself, my 
boy." 

"Just a minute." Grinning maliciously, David took down a bottle from the shelf of chemicals, 
poured a colorless liquid into a 
beaker, and walked casually toward the doorway as he agitated 
the mixture of hydrogen sulphide 
and mercaptans. He held his 



10 




 



breath, then coughed, when the 
fumes of putrescence filled the 
room and drifted out the door. 
He looked into the technician's 
room. 

"Sorry for the aroma, girls, but 
this is a vital experiment." 

"Can't you at least shut the 
door?" one called pleadingly. 

"Explain to the watchguard out 
there, will you?" Closing the 
door, he turned on the ventilator 
and sat down beside Dr. Haslam. 

"Why all the melodrama?" 
Karl asked, baffled. "First you 
call me by emergency code, then 
you hole in like a conspirator. 
I'm beginning to think you're a 
great loss to Theater. What's happened? Why is it later than I 
think?" 

"Do you take everything as a 
joke, Karl?" 

"Certainly, until I'm forced to 
do otherwise. What's worrying 
you?" 

"I'm afraid of being arrested 
for treason. Don't laugh ! This 
morning I received a message, 
delivered in person by our old 
schoolmate Lanza, to report to 
Leader Marley on Wednesday, 
and Marley hasn't paid any attention to me since he last inspected our lab, years ago. For 
another thing, Leah Hachovnik is 
making a nuisance of herself with 
her curiosity about my affairs. If 
she weren't so clumsy about her 
prying, I'd almost believe she was 



under orders to spy on me." 

Karl moved impatiently. "I 
hope you're not turning psychotic. You have a clean record 
of continuous production and 
you've never mixed in politics. 
You've never expressed what you 
may really think of our Leader 
even to me, although we've been 
friends since we were in Medschool, and I hope you never will. 
And you're making progress with 
White Martian. Why, my boy, 
you're all set! What's treasonable 
about that?" 

Someone knocked at the door. 
Hastily David uncovered the 
fragrant beaker and waved it 
about as he called, "Come in!" 

The watchguard loriked in for 
an instant, wrinkled his nose, and 
quickly shut the door. Laughing, 
David covered the beaker, and 
began walking about with long 
nervous strides, snapping his 
fingers as he tried to explain. 

"I'm in trouble, Karl. I've run 
into something I don't know how 
to deal with, and I need help, I 
need advice, I need cooperat ion. 
I've lived alone with this thing 
for ten long years, hoping month 
after month that something 
would turn up so I could evade 
the issue. But nothing has. And 
now there's going to be a showdown." 

Karl touched his arm sympathetically. "My dear boy — " 
"That's it!" shouted David.

Hi 



"What's what?" 

"That's what I'm trying to tell 
you. Why do you always call me 
your 'dear boy?' You know I'm 
a year older than you are." 

"It's just habit, I suppose. You 
look so young — your hair is 
black, while mine is nearly white. 
You're full of vigor, while I begin to creak with middle age. I 
didn't realize that I irritated you 
with my little phrase. I should 
think you'd be pleased that you 
have somehow managed to sip at 
the fountain of youth." 

David sank down on a stool. 
"I'm not pleased. I'm terrified.'* 

"What do you mean?" 

"I mean that's exactly what's 
happened. I have sipped at the 
fountain of youth. I've discovered how to keep people from 
growing old. I myself have not 
aged a bit in the last ten years." 

There was a long silence. Karl 
sat unmoving, his face like stone. 

"I don't believe you," he said 
at last. 

"It's no longer a question of 
belief. In a few days everybody 
will know, the proof will stare 
you in the face. And what will 
happen then?" 

"Evidence?" Karl asked. "I 
can't accept a statement as a 
fact." 

"Would you like to see my 
mice? Come with me." 

David Wong hurried into the 
small animal room and paused 



before a stack of wire cages in 
which furry creatures darted and 
squeaked. 

"You remember when we were 
working on Blue Martian, those 
peculiar mutants we found in our 
mice, and how I used six of them 
in trying to make antibodies to 
the virus?'\ 

"I remember," said Karl. 
"They were spotted with tufts 
of white hair on the right forelegs." 

David took down a cage, thrust 
in his hand, and brought out two 
of the tiny black mice which 
crawled over his trembling hand. 
Their right forelegs bore tufts of 
long white hair. 

"These," he said, "are the same 
mice." 

"Their descendants, you mean. 
Mice don't live that long." 

"These mice do. And they'll 
go on living. For years I've lived 
in fear that someone would notice 
and suspect the truth. Just as for 
years, every time someone has 
laughed and told me I never 
seemed to age a day, I've been 
terrified that he might guess the 
truth. I'm not aging." 

Karl looked dazed. "Well, my 
boy, you've got a bear by the 
tail. How did you find the elixir 
or whatever it is?" 

"You remember the early work 
with radioactive tracers, a couple 
of hundred years ago, that proved 
that all our body cells are in a 



%7L 




 



continuous state of flux? There's 
a dynamic equilibrium between 
the disintegration and the resynthesis of the essential factors such 
as proteins, fats and amino 
groups, but the cell directs all 
the incoming material into the 
right chemical structures, under 
the influence of some organizing 
power which resides in the cell. 

"Foreign influences like viruses 
may disrupt this order and cause 
cancer. The cells are continually in a state of change, but always replace their characteristic 
molecules, and it is only as they 
grow older that they gradually 
become 'worn out.' Then the body 
grows old, becomes less resistant 
to infection, and eventually succumbs to one disease or another. 
And you know, of course, that 
viruses also have this self-duplicating ability. 

"I reasoned that at birth a 
man had a definite, finite amount 
of this essential self-duplicating 
entity — SDE — in his body cells, 
.a kind of directing factor which 
reproduces itself, but more slowly 
than do the body cells. In that 
case, with the normal multiplication of the cells, the amount of 
SDE per cell would slowly but 
surely grow smaller with the 
years. Eventually the time would 
come when the percentage would 
be below the critical level — the 
cells would be less resistant, 
would function with less effi


ciency, and the man would 'grow 
old.' " 

Karl nodded soberly. "Reasonable hypothesis." 

"But one day, by pure chance, 
I isolated a component which I 
recognized as being the factor essential to the normal fund inning 
of body cells. It hit me like a 
toothache. I found that I could 
synthesize the SDE in the lab, 
and the only problem then was 
to get it into a man's cells. If I 
could do that, keep the SDE level 
up to that of youth, a man would 
stop aging! Since viruses penetrate our cells when they infect 
us, it was no trick at all to effect 
a chemical coupling of the SDE 
to the virus. I used Martian Blue, 
since it was handy, and its effects 
ar* usually brief. 

"Presto! Old age is held at bay 
for another twenty or thirty years 
— I really don't know how long. 
These mice were my first experiment, and as you see, they're still 
alive. Next, I tried it on myself." 

David put the mice back in 
their cage, locked it, and returned 
to the lab. 

"Tomorrow, the whole thing is 
bound to come out because 
Tanya Hachovnik is coming 
back. You know her sister Leah 
— gray, dried-up. soured on life. 
Well, I've had ways of checking, 
and when Tanya Hachovnik 
walks into the Institute, everyone 
will see her as the same lusCious

redhead of twenty-five we knew 
ten years ago. I realize that what 
I did was a criminal act. I didn't 
think the thing through or I 
wouldn't have been such a fool. 
But when I made those final experiments, I used the Hachovnik 
twins for a controlled pair." 
"You must have been crazy!" 

14 



"Perhaps I was. I'd tried it on 
myself, of course, with no bad 
effects except a few days' fever, 
but I realized that without a control I never could be sure the 
SDE was actually working. It 
might be just that my particular 
genetic constitution caused me to 
age more slowly than the average. 


 



So I chose the twins. To Leah I 
gave the attenuated Martian 
Blue, but to Tanya I gave the 
simple Blue coupled with SDE. 
The experiment worked. Identical twins — one grows old like 
other people; the other remains 
young. I know now, Karl, how to 
prolong youth indefinitely. But 
what in the name of Leader Marley shall I do with my knowledge?" 

Karl Haslam absently twisted 
his white hair and spoke slowly, 
as though he found trouble in 
choosing his words. 

"You realize, of course, that it 
is your duty to acquaint Leader 
Marley with all the details of 
your discovery?" 

"Is it? Can you imagine what 
this will do to our society? What 
about the generations of children 
coming into a world where no 
places have been vacated for them 
by death? What about the struggles for power? Who will decide, 
and on what basis, whether to 
confer or to withhold this gift? 
There'll be riots, civil wars. I 
know that I'm only a scientist; 
all I ever wanted from life was 
to be left alone, in a peaceful 
laboratory, and let other people 
worry about the world and its 
troubles. But now — don't you see 
that by the mere fafct that I made 
this discovery, I've lost the right 
to sit by quietly and let other 
people make the decisions?" 



"But, David, you and I aren't 
able to handle such a problem! 
We're only Research!" 

"I know. We're inadequate, yet 
we have the responsibility. The 
men who created atomic power 
probably felt inadequate, too, but 
could they have made as bad a 
mess of handling it as others did? 
Suppose I did turn this over to 
Marley — he'd use it to become 
the most absolute tyrant in the 
history of the race." 

Karl ran his fingers through 
his hair and smiled crookedly. 
"Well, you could always start a 
revolution, I suppose, and start 
by assassinating the Leader." 

"With what kind of weapon? 
Men like you and me are not allowed to own so much as an oldfashioned pistol. Except for the 
Military, Marley's the only man 
allowed to wear a Needier. And, 
besides, I'm a Research, not a 
Military. I hate violence and I'm 
naturally conditioned against killing." 

"Then you shouldn't have got 
into this mess. It would have been 
far better never to have discovered this SDE. I presume your 
notes are safely locked up, by the 
way?" 

David grinned. "Don't worry 
about my notes; they're written

hereditary baldness by the injection of certain parahormones? 
Leader Marley rewarded me with 
a Free Choice, and I chose to 
learn a dead language. Not half 
a dozen men in the world could 
read my notes." 

"If your notes are safe, why 
don't you just destroy your mice 
and get rid of your proof that 
way?" 

"And the Hachovnik twins?" 

"You could at least keep Tanya 
out of sight." 

"Don't be a fool. That would 
only be a temporary measure and 
has nothing to do with the real 
problem. Lanza and Marley may 
suspect the truth right now, for 
all I know; they keep such close 
watch on my work. Anyway, the 
secret is bound to come out sooner 
or later." 

Dr. Haslam clasped his hands 
and stared at them for a long 
while. His lined face looked 
grayer than ever. 

He looked up at last with a 
faint smile. "Well, my boy, I 
never asked you to discover this 
stuff, but since you have — I 
hereby burn my bridges! You're 
right, we can't give it to Marley. 
But you can't handle it alone. 
What we need is time, and we 
haven't got it. We shall both be 
liquidated before this is over, 
there's no doubt of that, but we 
must do what we can. When is 
Tanya arriving?" 



"Tomorrow night, on the Playground Jet." 

"And you see Leader Marley 
when?" 

"Next Wednesday." 

"Five days yet. Then this is 
what we'll do. Too bad Lanza is 
in the other camp, but there's 
you and me, and I think Hudson 
and Faure from Serology will 
come in with us. We'll need others 
■ — sociologists, anthropologists, 
psychologists — the most promising material from all Categories 
if we're to create a new society 
based on the prospect of immortality. But I'll see the first 
two and bring them to your 
apartment tomorrow night for 
Tanya's welcome-home party. I 
leave it to you to muzzle Leah." 

"That won't do," said David. 
"I don't have a current Free 
Choice." 

"But I have. Two, as a matter 
of fact, a reward for curing the 
insomnia of Leader Marley's 
wife. I choose to give a party, I 
choose tomorrow night, and I 
choose your apartment." 

A knock rattled the door, and ' 
the watchguard thrust in his 
head. "How much longer is this 
here experiment going to take? 
Do you guys N want to be reported?" 

"Just finishing, Officer," called 
Karl. "You can leave the door 
open now." 

"What a stink!" said the guard.

"Thank God I'm in Military!" 

IT hardly seemed like a party, 
David thought. His guests 
were ill at ease, and their conversation labored, then stopped 
altogether when the Menial came 
into the library with a tray of 
glasses and niblets. 

"Put them on the liquor cabinet, James," said David. "And 
that will be all. Enjoy yourself 
tonight." 

The Menial put down the tray 
and then stooped to fumble with 
the lock. 

"Let that alone! I've told you 
a thousand times not to monkey 
with my liquor cabinet!" 

"Don't you want me to get out 
the ice cubes. Doctor?" 

"I'll do it. You can go now." 
"But are you sure you won't 
want me later in the evening, 
Doctor? Who's to serve the supper? Who's going to clear up 
afterward?" 

"We'll manage. Don't worry 
about us." 

James shuffled out of the room. 
"I suppose that means /'// 
manage," said Leah, with a selfpitying sigh. 'Tve. noticed that 
whenever people decide to rough 
it and do without a Menial, they 
take it for granted the women 
will do the work, never the men 
— unless the women are still 
young and pretty. Well, at any 
rate, I'll have Tanya to help me. 



I still don't see why you wouldn't 
let me go to the Port to meet her. 
Dr. Wong." 

"I just thought it would be 
more of a celebration if we had a 
surprise party all waiting for her 
to walk into. Dr. Haslam will 
bring her here directly from the 
Port, and here we all are, her old 
friends from the Institute, waiting to welcome her home." 

"I'd hardly say all," said Leah. 
"I'm the only person from Office 
that's here. And why have a party 
in your Library, Dr. Wong? 
Nothing here but books, books, 
books." 

"Because I keep my liquor 
here, in the only room I have a 
right to lock up. My Menial is a 
good man, but he can't resist an 
opened bottle." 

"Well, it's still a gloomy party." 

David turned appealingly to 
his other guests, Hudson and 
Faure, but they only looked uncomfortable. 

"Perhaps we need a drink." 
David unlocked the cupboard 
and picked up a bottle which he 
set down hastily when he heard 
voices in the hall. He hurried to 
the outer door and opened it a 
few inches to reveal the sturdy 
shoulders of the watchguard of 
the floor and. beyond him. Karl 
Haslam. 

"Everything in order. Officer?" 
asked Karl. 

"Your permit is in order. Dr. 



CATEGORY PHOENI! 



Haslam. A private party. Let me 
just check — yes, three guests have 
arrived, and you two make five. 
That all? You have until midnight. But it beats me why you 
people in Research prefer a- party 
without a watchguard, or why 
Leader Marley ever gives permission. Why, in all my years in 
Military, I've never been to an 
unwatched party, and I must say 
it never held us down any." 

Karl laughed a little too 
forcedly. "I'll bet it didn't! But 
all Research people are a little 
peculiar. You must have noticed 
that yourself." 

"Well—" 

"And you know how generous 
Leader Marley is, and how kind 
he is to loyal citizens. He wants 
us*to be happy, so he pampers us 
now and then." 

"I guess he knows what he's 
doing, all right. Well, I'll check 
you out at twelve, then." 

"Go on in. Tanya," said Karl. 

They stepped into the apartment and David quietly closed 
the door. 

"Hi, Sis," drawled Leah. "You 
made us wait long enough!" She 
walked toward the girl, hand outstretched, then stopped with a 
gasp of disbelief. 

Tanya's red hair was still brilliant and gleaming, her creamy 
skin unlined^ and her full red lips 
curved up into a friendly smile as 
she leaned forward for a sisterly 



kiss. But Leah jerked away and 
glared with anger. 

A puzzled frown creased Tanya's lovely white forehead. 

"What's the matter, Leah? 
Aren't you glad lo see me? You 
look so strange, as though you'd 
been terribly til!" 

Leah shook her head, tears of 
rage gathering in her pale eyes. 
"I'm okay," she whispered. "It's 
you. You haven't changed. I 
have. You're still young, you're 
pretty, you're just the way I used 
to be.'" She whirled to face David, 
her voice choking. 

"What have you done to her, 
Dr. Wong?" 

The four men in the room were 
all staring at the sisters, scarcely 
believing what they saw, although 
they had all betn prepared for 
the contrast. The twin sisters were 
no longer twins. One had retained 
her youth; the other was faded, 
aging. 

"This is awful." Haslam muttered. "Absolutely ghastly." He 
put a comforting hand on Leah's 
shoulder, and with a deep sob she 
hid her face against him and 
cried. 

Hudson and Faure could not 
take their eyes from Tanya, and 
David leaned against the wall to 
stop his trembling. 

"Sit down, all of you," he said. 
"First we'll have a drink. I'm 
sure we all need it. Then we'll 
face — what has to be faced." 




 



AN hour later, they had 
achieved a calmness, of sorts. 
They had given up some of their 
normal sobriety to achieve the 
calm, but they were grateful to 
the drug for cushioning the shock. 

David paced the floor, glass in 
hand, talking rapidly as he finished his long explanation. 

"So you see what happened," 
he said. "When I began the experiment, I had no idea how staggering the results might be. That 
is, I knew in my mind, but I 
never imagined the realness of 
what would happen. I thought 
of it as just an experiment.** 

Leah sniffed, her resentment 
somewhat dulled by drink. "So I 
was just an experiment! Don't 
you ever think about people's 
feelings? I know I'm not as good 
as you are; I'm only Office, but 
I'm human." 

Karl patted her hand. "Of 
course you are, Leah. But that 
is one of the defects of people in 
Research — they forget about human emotions." He looked up 
sternly at David. "They go ahead 
with their experiments, and hang 
the consequences. If Dr. Wong 
had had any sense, he would 
never have kept this a secret for 
ten years, and we might have 
had ten years to prepare ourselves 
for such a responsibility. Instead, 
we have only a few days or, at 
most, weeks. Hudson! Faure! 
How do you feel about this thing 



now? Are you still game?" 

Both men seemed a little dazed, 
but Faure pulled himself together, speaking slowly, like a 
man in a dream. 

"We're with you. It's still hard 
to believe : we've got immortality!" » 

"I'd hardly call it immortality," said Hudson drily, "since, 
as I understand it, SDE does not 
kill disease entities, nor ward off 
bullets or the disintegrating nuclear shaft of the needier — as we 
will very likely find out before 
very long. But what do we do 
now? When people see these two 
girls together, it won't be an, hour 
before Marley hears about it." 

David spoke up with a new 
authority. "He must not hear 
about it. I know how poorly 
equipped I am to handle this 
situation, but since I created it, I 
must assume responsibility, and 
I have made my plans. 

"First, you, Tanya. Try to 
realize that if the Leader finds 
out that I have this secret of 
keeping youth, he will want it for 
himself. Nobody in Menial, nobody in Office, nobody in Research — almost nobody at all — 
will be allowed to benefit from it. 
Marley will use it as a special 
reward for certain Rulers, and he 
will try to keep its very existence 
a secret so that people in general 
will not be envious or rebellious. 
That means that he will have to 



CATEGORY PHOENIX 



1* 



get rid of you." 

"Get rid of me? But I haven't 
done any harm!" 

"Just by existing and letting 
people look at your unchanging 
youth, you will be a threat to 
him. for you will give away his 
secret. How he'll deal with you, 
I don't know. Concentration 
camp, exile, or more probably, 
simple execution on grounds of 
treason, such as unauthorized 
choices of activity or study. It 
doesn't matter, he'll find a way. 
The only safety for you is in 
keeping hidden. You must stay 
quietly in Leah's apartment until we can find a refuge for you. 
Do you see that?" 

She looked around in bewilderment. "Is that right, Dr. Haslam? 
And what will they think at the 
Institute? I'm supposed to go 
back to my job in Intercom." 

"Dr. Wong is right," he said 
kindly. "Please believe us. It's 
hard for you to understand that 
we are asking you to do some' 
thing secret, but just try to remember that you are, after all, 
an Office Category and are not 
equipped by training or constitution to think out problems like 
this. We'll tell you what is the 
right thing to do. You just do as 
we tell you, and you'll be perfectly safe." 

Leah snickered. "Oh, she'll be 
safe enough, being as pretty as 
she is! What are you going to do 



about me? Don't I count?" 

"We'll come to that in a few 
minutes. Right now, we need food. 
Leah, you and Tanya be good 
girls and go out to the kitchen 
and heat up some supper for us. 
After we've eaten, we'll talk about 
you." 

AS soon as the girls were out 
of the room, the four men 
drew together at the table. 

"No use burdening them with 
too much knowledge," Karl remarked. "Even as it is, they are 
a great danger to us, and the 
less they know the better. David, 
will you proceed?" 

"I have little to add to the 
plans we made last night at the 
lab. The thing we need most is 
time; and next to that, a hiding 
place. We may very soon be 
classed as traitors, with every 
watchguard on the continent 
hunting for us. We will take care 
that they don't find us. Now, you 
said last night that each one of 
you has accumulated a Free 
Choice during the past year, 
which hasn't yet been used." 

"That's right," said Faure". "I 
intended to use mine next winter 
to live among the Australian aborigines for a week. I've been 
wanting that for years, but the 
planners always refused me ; it 
was a project without practical 
purpose." 

"And I intended to use mine

to attempt a water-color painting," added Hudson. "In ray boyhood I hoped to be put in Arts 
Category, but the Planners 
laughed at me. I suppose it's 
wrong, yet I still have the yen." 

"You have my sympathy," 
said Karl. "I was going to take 
an Aimless Tramp. Just shed my 
identity and wander on foot 
through the great north area of 
woods and t lakes." 

David sighed. "Well, if we are 
successful in hiding and in changing the world as we'd like, you 
can all three be free to do as you 
like without asking permission. 
But at present that's only the 
wildest of dreams. And, first, we 
must find our refuge. Today is 
Saturday. Tomorrow morning, 
each of you will go to BureauMed 
and claim your Free Choice. And 
each of you will choose an Aimless Tramp/* 

"But I don't like hiking," objected Hudson. 

"You won't be hiking. You'll 
take off in your roboplanes and 
then disappear. You will be without supervision. You will then 
proceed, disguised as you think 
suitable, to find a place for our 
new colony — somewhere in South 
America? — and make preliminary 
arrangements to receive us. You. 
must be back by Tuesday afte* 
noon at the latest. On Tuesday, 
as soon as you have reported 
back to tjBureauMed, get to the 



Institute as fast as you can." 

"Why the deadline?" 

"Because by Tuesday afternoon, sometime before evening, 
probably, I expect all three of 
you to be suffering from an attack 
of Blue Martian Fever, and I 
want you to get expert hospital 
care. You will be the nucleus of 
the new regime." 

Karl laughed. "I wish you 
could have picked a base for 
your SDE that was less unpleasant than Blue Martian." 

"Who's got Blue Martian?** 
asked Tanya, as the girls came in 
from the kitchen with their trays 
of food. "I'll never forget how 
sick it made me." 

"You should worry,** said Leah. 
"It kept you young and beautiful, didn't it?" 

"You won't have to envy her, 
Leah," said David going to the 
liquor cabinet. "I'm going to give 
you and the others a shot of the 
SDE-Martian Blue. Sometime 
Tuesday afternoon you should 
feel the first symptoms. But after 
forty-eight hours in the hospital, 
you'll be good as new. And you 
will all stop growing older." 

They watched, fascinated, as 
he opened the cooling compartment of the liquor cupboard. 

"I always like plenty of ice in 
my drinks," he remarked, drawing out a tray of cubes and opening a small door behind the tray. 
He removed several small bottles

spot on the upper deltoid, 

Karl laughed. "Here I come, 

Methuselah !" 

"All set?" asked David. 

He plunged the needle home. 

DAVID ran up the steps of the 
Institute, two at a time, and 
hurried toward his office through 
the echoing corridors, where the 
usual watchguard sauntered on 
patrol. 

"Morning, Jones." 
"Good morning, Doctor, Pretty 
early, aren't you?" 

"Wednesday's my busy day." 
He settled at his desk, miserably 
conscious of the open door and 
curious eyes behind him, opened 
his briefcase, then glanced at his 
wristwatch. More than an hour 
before his interview with Leader 
Marley. 

Spreading some data sheets before him, he looked at them 
blankly as he tried to order his 
thoughts. His eyes were ringed 
with dark depressions, for he had 
had no sleep, There had been so 
many things to plan for, so many 
arrangements to make. 

It was possible, of course, that 
this morning's talk would turn 
out to be mere routine. There 
might remain several weeks of 
freedom — but there might be only 
a few hours. He shrank from the 
complexity of the problem before 
him; he was a Research man, devoted to his test tubes and his 



culture growths, and would have 
been happy never to face any 
problem beyond them. 

He had a moment's revulsion 
at the Unfairness of the fact that 
a simple experiment in the lab, 
an addition to man's knowledge 
of the Universe, should have 
plunged him against his will into 
a situation far beyond his ability 
to handle. There had been, as 
Karl pointed out, the alternative 
of turning the SDE over to the 
Leader. That would have absolved him of all responsibility. 
But that was the trouble, he 
thought. Responsibility could not 
be confined to squiggles in his 
notebook, when those squiggles 
might affect the whole of society. 

"Dr. Wong!" 

He jumped and turned around 
hastily. 

"Leah! What in the world?" 

She stood in the doorway, glaring at him, breathing heavily as 
though she were trying to hold 
back sobs. Slowly she tottered 
to the desk and sank down into 
her chair by the stenograph. 

"You doublecrosser!" she whispered. 

He looked quickly at the doorway, but the guard had not come 
back. Leaning forward, he questioned her fiercely. 

"What are you doing here? 
They told me yesterday that several people had come down with 
attacks of Blue Martian. Why 



CATEGORY PHOENIX

aren't you in the hospital with 
the others?" 

"Because I wasn't sick!" 

"But I gave you — " 

"Imagine how I felt," she raced 
on, "watching Dr. Haslam start 
having a chill, hearing Dr. Faure 
complain about his awful headache, and listening to Dr. Hudson 
dial Intercom and call for a doctor. And all that time I was waiting, waiting for something to 
happen to me. And nothing did! 
What have you got against me, 
Dr. Wong, that you infect all the 
others and only pretend to do it 
to me? I don't want to grow old 
any more than they do!" 

"But I wasn't pretending. 
Quiet, now, and let me think." 

He waited until the watchguard 
had passed by the door, then 
raised his head. 

"Look here. Leah, Evidently 
the infection didn't take. This is 
what must have happened. That 
treatment I gave you ten years 
ago must have made you permanently immune to Blue Martian, 
and the antibodies it formed in 
your cells simply protected you 
against this new invasion of the 
virus. It never occurred to me 
that the immunity would last so 
long. But don't worry, I'll find a 
way." 

She looked suspicious. "What 
do you mean?" 

"I mean that there's no reason 
why Blue Martian should be the 



only vehicle for giving you the 
SDE. There must be other viruses 
that will work equally well. It's 
only a question of finding one." 

"And how long will that take 
you?" 

"How long does anything take 
in Research? Maybe a week, 
maybe a year." 

"And maybe ten! I can't wait, 
Dr. Wong. I'm thirty-five now; 
I'm growing older. What good 
will a long life do me, if it only 
preserves me as the middle-aged 
woman I'll be by then? And all 
those years that I'll be getting 
older and older, there'll be Tanya, 
lively and pretty, to remind me 
that I was once like that, too. I 
can't face it!" 

"The watchguard will hear 
you!" Haggard-faced, he watched 
her shaking shoulders, hearing her 
muffled sobs. 

"You're a criminal, Dr. Wong! 
It was a crime, what you did to 
Tanya and me." 

"I didn't realize in the beginning or I'd never have touched 
the thing. I know it now. even 
better than you do. but what can 
I do?" 

She looked up and wiped her 
eyes, her mouth set hard. "1 know 
what I can do. I can report you 
to the Leader." 

"What good will that do? You 
know how terrible you feel now 
about being left out — though I 
swear I never meant it to be like

this. But just try to imagine. If 
you report me so that Leader 
Marley gets the secret of SDE, 
then thousands of people will be 
put in just the same situation you 
are in. You're only one person 
suffering. But then there'd be 
hundreds of thousands, millions! 
Surely you wouldn't want to 
have that on your conscience?" 

"Do you think I'd care?" 

"You would when you felt 
calmer. You're wrought up, ill. 
Let me send you home. Promise 
me you'll go home quietly, talk 
it over with Tanya, and not say 
anything to anyone else. I'll think 
of a way out for you. Just be 
patient." 

"Patient!" 

He thought of calling Karl 
Haslam. Karl would know best 
how to deal with her, how to 
bring her back to reason. He 
reached toward the intercom, 
then dropped his hand in despair. 
Karl was in the hospital, with 
Fauree and Hudson, shivering 
with the cold of Blue Martian 
fever. But he had to get her away. 

He pressed the intercom dial. 
"Dr. Wong speaking. Miss Hachovnik is ill and is being sent home. 
Please send an aircab for her at 
once." 

He helped Leah to her feet, 
and spoke pleadingly. 

"Promise you'll be good, 
Leah?" 

The fury in her eyes nearly 



knocked him down. Without a 
word, without a gesture, she 
walked out. 

T\AVID felt as though he'd 
■^-^ been put through a wringer 
as he followed Officer Magnun 
into the Leader's suite at State 
House. Several nights of sleeplessness, the worries of planning 
for a refuge, and the scene with 
Leah had left him limp and spiritless. The girl was a danger, he 
knew, but she was only one of 
many. 

He nodded at Dr. Lanza, who 
was busy reading reports from 
BureauMed, and saluted Leader 
Marley, who was talking with a 
watchguard. 

Marley looked up briefly. "Sit 
down, Wong." 

David folded himself into a 
chair, grateful for a few moments 
in which to collect himself, while 
Marley gave the last of his orders. 

"Put them in the Vermont 
granite quarries, and keep them 
at work for the next year." 

"As you say, Leader. With the 
usual secrecy, of course?" 

"No, you blockhead! These are 
a bunch of nobodies. Use all the s 
publicity you can get. Keep a 
punishment a secret and how can 
it have any effect on other people? No, I want full radio and 
news coverage and telecast showings as they swing the first pick 
at the first rocks. People' have

got to realize that the Leader 
knows best, that treason doesn't 
pay. No matter how clever they 
think they are, they'll always get 
caught. Understand?" 

"As you say, Leader." 

"Then get going." As the guard 
left the room, Leader ^Marley 
turned to David. "What fools 
people are!'* 

He ran his beefy hands through 
a shock of black hair, blinked his 
eyes, and wrinkled the heavy 
black brows that met over his 
nose. Wondcringly, he shook 
his massive head as he drew his 
gleaming needier from his breast 
pocket and played with it, tossing 
it from hand to hand while he 
talked. • 

"LJm probably the most generous Leader the State has had 
since the Atomic Wars, Wong, 
and I never withhold a privilege 
from someone who has deserved 
it. But people mistake me when 
they think that I am weak and 
will overlook treason." 

"Your generosity is a byword, 
Leader Marley," said Wong. "But 
some people are incapable of acting for their best interests even 
when you have defined it for 
them. Who are these latest traitors?" 

"Oh, nobody really important, 
of cdurse, except as they waste 
time which they owe to the State. 
Just attempts at illegal study. An 
Office Category who had found 



a basement room in a deserted 
buihding and was spending all his 
evening hours there practicing 
the violin. A Theater man who 
was illegally trying to learn carpentry. And a teacher of mathematics who had forged a key to 
the Linguistics library, and had 
been getting in every night to 
study a dead language — Cuneiform, Latin, something like that, 
utterly without practical value. 
This last one is an old man, too, 
and ought to have known better. 
People must be made to realize 
that if they want the privilege 
of useless study, they will have 
to earn it. And I am very broadminded in such cases." 

"Nobody has better reason to 
know that than I, Leader Marley, 
and I am always grateful to you." 

Marley coughed and straightened the jacket over his bearlike 
chest as he put back his needier. 

"Now to business. Where's that 
memorandum, Lanza?" 

Dr. Lanza handed him the 
paper, then sat down beside the 
Leader. 

"First. When Dr. Lanza called 
on you last week, he found the 
door to your office locked. What 
explanation do you have?" 

David smiled and spread his 
hands. "My explanation is the 
generosity of Leader Marley. You 
have so many affairs to occupy 
your attention that it is not surprising that you do not remember 



3E4 




 



rewarding me with a Free Choice 
some years ago, for my work on 
Martian Blue. I chose, as I am 
sure you remember now, an occasional hour of Privacy." 

The Leader blinked. "That's 
right I had forgotten. Well, the 
Leader never goes back on his 
word. Though why in the name 
of Marley you fellows want a 
crazy thing like that is beyond 
me. What do you do, behind a 
locked door, that you don't want 
anyone to see?" 

"Do you doubt my loyalty, 
Leader Marley?" 

"I doubt everything. What do 
you want with Privacy?" 

Lanza broke in amiably. "I'm 
afraid we just have to accept 
such wishes as one of the harmless abnormalities of the Research mind, Leader. Since I grew 
up in that Category, I understand 
it to some extent." 

"You're right in calling it abnormal. I think perhaps I'd better remove that from the possible 
Choices in the future. It could 
easily be misused, and it never 
did make any sense to me. 

"Well, second. It's been more 
than three years since you reported any progress with the 
problem of White Martian Fever, 
Wong. What is your explanation?" 

"Research is not always swift, 
Leader." 

"But I distinctly ordered you 



to find an immunizing agent 
within three years. Our colonies 
on Mars cannot wait forever. I've 
been patient with you, but you've 
had more than enough time." 

"I am very sorry, Leader Marley. I have done my best and so 
have my col leagues. But the 
problem is complex. If I may 
explain, we had to find a suitable 
culture medium for growing the 
virus, and then we had to work 
at the problem of coupling it 
with suitable haptens — " 

Impatiently, Marley waved his 
hand. "You know I don't understand your jargon. That's not my 
business, what troubles you've 
had. I want results. You got results on Blue Martian quickly 
enough." 

"We were fortunate. But when 
we storm the citadel of knowledge, Leader Marley, no one can 
predict how long it will take for 
the citadel to fall." 

"Nonsense! I'm warning you, 
Wong, yeu're failing in your duty 
to the State, and you can't escape 
the consequences with poetic 
doubletalk. I allow special privileges to you people in Research 
and I expect a proper appreciation in return. When I order you 
to produce a protection for White 
Martian, I want results!" 

"But you can't get a thing like 
that just by asking for it. Such 
things are simply not under your 
control."

"Watch yourself, Wong! Your 
remarks are dangerously close-to 
treason!" 

"Is it treason to tell you a 
plain fact?" 

Stony-faced, David stared defiantly at Marley, trying to control the trembling of his 'body. If 
he had had a needier at that instant, he realized incredulously, 
he would have shot the Leader 
and thought his own life a small 
price to pay for such a pleasure. 

Lanza coughed. "Fm afraid Dr. 
Wong is not well, Leader. Worrying over the slowness of his work 
has distorted his reactions. But I 
am sure that you will understand, 
as you always do, and be indulgent." 

"£11 overlook your remarks, 
Wong," said Marley, relaxing. 
/'But you'd better change your 
attitude. You Research people 
cause me more trouble than any 
other three Categories put together. Sometimes I wonder if a 
spell in the granite quarries 
mightn't — " 

A light flashed on his desk. He 
watched the blinking code for a 
second, then ro^e abruptly and 
left the room. 

The tv/o ' men sat in silence. 
David glanced at Lanza, and 
Lanza shifted in his chair. 

"Thanks for the good word," 
•aid David wc :.riiy. "How do you 
like being a Pnler. by the way? 
When we were at Medschool to


gether, I thought you were a man 
with ideas." 

"When I was at Medschool I 
didn't know what was good for 
me," Lanza replied stiffly. 

"And you think you do now?" 

A slow flush crept over Lanza's 
face. "Look here, Wong! Each 
man has to make his own terms 
with himself. Don't act so smug! 
You shut yourself away inside the 
nice white walls of your laboratory and ignore all the conflicts 
of life. You shut your ears and 
your eyes, live in perfect harmony with your test tubes, and 
let the world go hang. Well, that 
isn't my way." 

"Your way, apparently, is to 
worm yourself into the confidence 
of that steel-hearted imbecile who 
rules our lives and our thoughts, 
and spend twenty-four hours a 
day saying, 'Yes, Yes.' and waiting for him to die so you can step 
into his shoes!" 

"We're alone," Said Lanza. "I 
won't report you. But I have no 
intention of justifying myself. 
Have you any idea why you've 
been let alone for so long? You 
haven't produced anything tangible in several years. Haven't you 
ever wondered why no one put on 
the pressure? Haven't — " 

He broke off as Marley lumbered back into the room and 
fell into a chair. The Leader's 
manner had altered. He stared at 
David with grim inquiry, the 



M 




 



beady eyes traveling slowly over 
him, taking in his rumpled hair, 
his strained face, the rigid set of 
his shoulders. 

At last Marley spoke, his voice 
soft with menace. 

"You're looking well, Dr. 
Wong. Remarkably well. In fact, 
it occurs to me that you don't 
seem to have aged a bit since my 
last visit to your laboratory. Tell 
me, how do you keep your 
youth?" 

DAVID could feel the rush of 
blood through his body, feel 
the thud of his racing heart. He 
kept his voice low so that it would 
not tremble. 

"Thank you, Leader Marley, 
for your kindness in noticing my 
appearance. I suppose I chose my 
parents well. They both lived to 
be over ninety, you know." 

"This is no joking matter. I've 
just had a report. An epidemic 
of Blue Martian fever has broken 
out among the people of your 
Institute. Why have you not 
mentioned it?" 

"If you will forgive me, Leader 
Marley, I've had no chance. I 
reported it in the usual manner 
to the health authorities, and 
have here in my briefcase a memorandum which I hoped to bring 
to your attention, among several 
other matters, when you had finished giving your instructions to 
me." 



Marley continued implacably, 
"And how did this epidemic begin? It was my understanding 
that ho insect existed here on 
Earth that could transmit the 
virus. Yet several people from 
your lab came down with the 
disease on the same day. What 
is your explanation?" 

"It's very simple. To prepare 
the vaccine, as I am sure you 
will remember from your last 
visit to us, we have to keep in the 
lab a limited number of the Fafli, 
the Martian insects which act as 
hosts at one stage of the virus s 
life. Last week a Menial carelessly knocked over one of the 
cages and several Fafli escaped. 
The Menial was discharged, of 
course, and put in Punishment, 
but the damage had already been 
done." 

"You have a very ready explanation." 

"Would you rather I had none 
at all, Leader Marley?" 

"Well, let that go." Marley 
drummed his plump fingers on 
the desk as he continued. "There 
was another report for me just 
now. A report so wild, so incredible, so staggering that I can 
scarcely bring myself to take it 
seriously. From an Office Category at the Institute." 

David's heart beat wildly, but 
he forced a smile to his lips. "Oh, 
yes. You must mean Miss Hachovnik. I've been worried about 



CATEGORY PHOENIX 



that poor girl for some time.** 
"What do you mean, 'poor 
girl'?" 

"It's very distressing to me, because she has been a good and 
loyal worker for many years. But 
she is becoming unstable. She has 
a tendency to burst into tears 
over nothing, is sometimes hysterical, seems to have secret 
grievances, and is extremely jealous of all women whom she considers more attractive. She was 
never too bright, to be sure, but 
until recently she has done her 
work well, so I've hated to take 
any action. Just this morning I 
had to send her home because she 
was ill." 

"Do you mean to say," asked 
Mvky, "that none of her story 
is true?" 

"I dont know. What is her 
story?" 

"She reports that you have 
been working on a private project 
of your own, instead of on White 
Martian. That you have discovered a way to make people immortal, by infecting them with 
Blue Martian. What is your explanation?" 

David only stared, his mind so 
blurred with panic that he could 
not speak. His stunned silence 
was broken by a laugh. It was 
Dr. Lanza, leaning backward in 
his chair, holding himself over 
the stomach as he shook his head. 

"These hysterical women!" His 



laughter trailed off to a commiserating chuckle. "You're too 
forbearing, Wong. You shouldn't 
keep a worker who's so far gone. 
Take a leaf from Leader Marley's 
book and remember: Kindness is 
often weakness; when it is necessary for the good of the State, be 
harsh!" 

"I hardly know what to say," 
said David. "I had no idea she'd 
gone so far." 

"Then there's no truth in it?" 
Marley persisted. "What she says 
is impossible?" 

"Well," said David judiciously, 
"we people in Research have 
learned not to call anything impossible, but this dream of immortality is as old as the human 
race. We have a thousand legends 
about it, including the story of 
the Phoenix, that fabulous bird 
which, when consumed by fire, 
rose triumphant from its own 
ashes to begin life anew. A pretty 
story, of course. But I need only 
put it to a mind as logical as 
yours, Leader Marley. Throughout all the millenia of map's existence, the Sun has always risen 
each morning in the east, and 
thus we know that it always will. 
That is the order of nature. Likewise, from the earliest generations 
of man, no individual has ever 
lived longer than a hundred and 
some years, and thus we know 
that he never will. That is the 
order of Nature and we can't alter 



JO 




 



it to the best of my knowledge." 

Leader Marley was thoughtful. 
He touched the intercom. 

"Send in Officer Magnun." 

David held- his breath. 

"Magnun, Office Category 
Hachovnik is to be taken from 
her home at once and put in indefinite Psycho -detention." 

Marley stood up. "Very well, 
Dr. Wong. You may go. But I 
shall suspend your privilege of 
Privacy, at least until after you 
have devised a protection against 
White Martian. It is -not wise to 
disregard the wishes of the 
Leader. Lanza, show him out." 

At the street door, they paused. • 
Lanza looked at David speculatively. 

"You do keep your youth well, 
David." 

"Some people do." 

"I remember that legend of the 
Phoenix. What do you suppose 
the Phoenix did with his new 
life, once he'd risen from the 
ashes of his old self?" 

"I'm no philosopher." 

"Neither am I. But you and I 
both know that the principle of 
induction was exploded centuries 
ago. It's true that the Sun has 
always risen in the east. But is 
there anything to keep it, someday, from rising in the west?" 

rpHAT night David sat late at 
his desk. Through the open 
door behind him, he could hear 



the watchguard slowly pacing the 
dimly lit corridor. He could feel 
time pressing at his back. He 
was reprieved, he knew, but for 
how long? 

He got up, at one point, when 
the corridor behind him was 
quiet, and went to the bookcase. 
He pressed the brass handle, saw 
the shelves silently swing away 
from the wall, then set it back 
again. The mechanism, installed 
a century ago by a cautious politician, was still in good order. 

Back at his desk, he thought of 
Leah and her lost youth, lost because of his own impersonal attitude. He felt sorry for her, but 
there was nothing he could do 
for her now. It was a relief to 
know that Tanya, at least, remained hidden and secure in her 
sister's apartment. 

It was after midnight before he 
closed his notebook and locked it 
away in the top drawer. His plans 
were completed. There would not 
be time given him. he knew, to 
finish his work on White Martian. That would have to be 
dropped, and resumed at some 
more favorable time in the future 
— if there was a future for him. 
But he would begin at once to 
produce in quantity a supply of 
the SDE-Blue Martian, for he 
was sure that the untrained 
guards who watched his movements would never realize that 
he had shifted to another project. 



CATEGORY PHOENIX 



With a brief good night to the 
guard, he left the building to 
walk home. His shoulders were 
straight, his stride confident, and 
he disdained looking behind him 
to see if anyone was following. 
He had made his terms with himself, and only death, which he 
would certainly try to prevent, 
could alter his plans. 

Going into his apartment he 
wearily turned on the light. Then 
he froze, feeling as though he 
had been clubbed. Leah Hachovnik was huddled at one end of 
the sofa, her face dripping tears. 

"I thought you'd never come," 
she whispered. 

He slumped down beside her. 
"How did you get here, Leah? I 
thought you were — " 

hid in your hallway until 
the watchguard was at the other 
end. When his back was turned, 
I just took off my shoes and 
slipped in. I've been waiting for 
hours." Her voice was almost inaudible, spent beyond emotion. 

"They got Tanya," she said 
dully. "They took her away." 

"What happened? Quick!" 

"After I reported to BureauMed — I'm sorry I did that, Dr. 
Wong, but I just couldn't help 
myself. I didn't tell them about 
Tanya and the others, just about 
you. Then I walked around for 
hours, hating you, hating Tanya, 
hating everybody. Finally I got 
.so tired that I went home. Just as 



I got into the hall, I heard a 
loud knock and I saw Officer 
Magnun at my door. When 
Tanya opened it, he simply said, 
'Office Category Hachovnik?" 
When she nodded her head, he 
said, 'You're under detention.' 
She screamed and she fought, but 
he took her away. Since then, 
I've been hiding. I'm afraid." 

David tried to think. He remembered that he had said only 
"Miss Hachovnik" in his talk 
with the Leader. Had Marley 
never known that there was more 
than one? But Lanza surely knew. 
Or had he merely assumed that 
Magnun would ask for Leah? 
Would they realize, at Psychodetention, that they had the 
wrong woman? Probably not, for 
she would be hysterical with terror, and her very youth and 
beauty taken in connection with 
the "jealousy and envy of 
younger women" which was noted 
in her commitment order, would 
seem to confirm her madness. He 
was still safe, for a while — if he 
could keep Leah away from the 
Institute. 

"I'm afraid." she whimpered. 
"Don't let them put me away." 

"Then you'll have to do exactly 
as I tell you. Can you follow 
orders exactly?" 

"Yes, yes!" 

"I'll have to hide you here. We 
can fix up my library as a room 
for you. It's the only room I can 



32 




 



keep locked, and which my Menial never enters in my absenceWhatever happens, Leah — no 
matter what happens — keep 
yourself hidden. More than your 
life depends on that." 

"WTHEN the three convalescents 
** returned from the hospital, 
pale and shaky, David summoned them to his office. At the 
door, Watchguard Jones looked 
them over. 

"Say, that Blue Martian fever 
sure does take it out of you. You 
fellows look like you've been 
plenty sick!" 

"They have been," said David. 
"Let them by so they can sit 
down and rest." 

Jones moved aside, but he 
lounged in the doorway, listening. 

David ignored him. "Glad to 
see you back, gentlemen. I'll 
make this brief. You have been 
the victims of a laboratory accident just as much as if you'd 
been contaminated with radiation. Our Leader Marley, who 
understands the problems of all 
Categories, has very generously 
consented to grant you a two 
weeks' convalescence, in addition 
to a Free Choice. Take a few 
minutes to think over your decision." 

He strolled over to the window 
and looked out at the green of 
the trees just bursting into leaf. 



Then, as if on impulse, he turned 
back. 

"While you're thinking it over, 
will you look at these protocols? 
We discussed them before you 
got sick, you remember — a plan 
to prevent an epidemic of Blue 
Martian. Do you approve of the 
final form? I'd like to carry on, 
and after all," he added with an 
ironic smile, "it's getting later 
than we might think." 

He handed each man a sheet 
of paper whose contents were 
identical. They studied them. 
Karl Haslam was the first to 
speak. 

"You think, then, that other 
cases of Blue Martian may develop?" 

"It is certainly probable. Those 
Fafli insects were never caught." 

Karl looked back at his paper. 
It contained a list of names, some 
of which were well known to all 
the country, some of them obscure. Thoughtfully, he nodded 
as he ran down the list. 

Hudson glanced up, frowning, 
his finger pointed at one name. 

"I don't know," he said slowly, 
"that this particular experiment 
would prove useful. Surely the 
Lanza method has not proved to 
be as effective as we once hoped." 

"You may be right. But there's 
the bare possibility that the 
modified Lanza method might be 
of enormous benefit to us." 

"It is uncertain. Too much of 



CATEGORY PHOENIX 



33 



a risk. Tat's my opinion." 

"Then I'll reconsider. The rest 
has your approval? Very well. 
And now what choice have you 
made for your holiday?" 

"I think we are all agreed," 
said Karl soberly. "We'll have an 
Aimless Tramp." 

"An excellent idea," approved 
David. "Oh, Jones, will you get 
an aircab to take the doctors to 
BureauMed, and then arrange for 
their Roboplanes to be serviced 
and ready in an hour?" 

"I don't know as I ought to 
leave my post," said Jones. 

"You'd rather stay with us and 
perhaps be exposed to the Fever?" 

'V)kay, okay!" 

When his footsteps had died 
away, David leaned forward. 

"We've done our best. Another 
month or so and we should be 
completely ready for our retirement act." 

"If we have a month," said 
Faure. 

David grinned. "Well, if our 
time runs out, at least we'll go 
down fighting. You know all your 
lines, your props are ready, the 
plot is worked out, and we can 
slip into our makeup in an instant — provided the audience 
shows up." 

"You're getting to be quite a 
joker, David," said Karl. "What 
if the audience comes around to 
the stage door?" 

*Then we'll try to receive him 



properly. Our Leader is a man of 
iron, but I doubt that he's immortal." 

They heard the approaching 
guard. 

"I'm sure you'll benefit from 
your holiday," David went on. 
"That last .checkup showed an 
antibody titer entirely too high 
for safety." 

"In other words, it's time for 
us to get going?" asked Karl, 
smiling. 

"That's right. Only the next 
time the antibody curve rises, it 
will be for keeps." 

FOUR days later it was reported that Judge Brinton, the 
well-known champion of Category rights, was ill with Blue 
Martian fever. Three little-known 
nuclear physicists living in the 
same apartment in Oak Ridge 
developed symptoms on the same 
day. Sporadic cases of Blue Martian flared up all over the continent. Occasionally a whole family 
was affected — husband, wife, and 
all the children. There was a 
mild epidemic at MIT, a more 
serious one at the School of Social Structure, and at Harvard 
Medical School nearly a third 
of the senior class, and they the 
most brilliant, were hospitalized 
at the same time. 

Rumors blanketed the country 
like a fog, and people everywhere 
became uneasy. There were no 



34 




 



deaths from the illness, but the 
very idea that an infectious disease could flare up unpredictably 
all over the nation, out of control, was frightening. It was said 
that the disease had been beamed 
to Earth by alien enemies from 
space; that all its victims became 
sterile; or that their minds were 
permanently damaged. 

It was also said, though people 
laughed even as they repeated the 
rumor, that if you once had Blue 
Martian Fever you'd become immortal. This particular theory 
had been clearly traced to the 
favings of a red-haired madwoman who was confined to 
Psychodetention, but still it was 
too ridiculous not to repeat. For 
a week, comedians rang a hundred changes on the basic joke: 

Wife: Drop dead! 

Husband : I can't. I've had 
Blue Martian. 

The unrest became so great 
that Leader Marley himself appeared on the telecaster to reassure the nation. 

He was an impressive figure on 
the lighted screen, resting solid 
and at ease in a leather chair, 
raising his massive black head, 
lifting his big hand to gesture as 
his rich voice rolled out. 

"You have nothing to fear," 
he said. "Under your beneficent 
Leaders, infectious disease has 
been wiped out many years ago. 
BureauMed informs me that 



these scattered cases of Blue 
Martian fever have been caused 
by the escape of a few Fafli insects, which have, since then, 
been isolated and destroyed. The 
illness has no serious after-effects. 
And as for the rumors that it 
confers immortality — " 

He allowed his face to break 
into a pitying smile as he slowly 
shook his head, looking regretful 
and yet somehow amused. 

"Those who continue to spread 
gossip about the fever will only 
reveal themselves as either psychotics or traitors. Whichever 
they are, they will be isolated 
for the good of our society." 

The effect of his words was 
somewhat diminished by the 
brief glimpse people had of Dr. 
Lanza, who reached a hand to 
help the Leader rise. For Dr. 
Lanza wore an anxious frown, 
and his face was thin with worry. 

In spite of numerous arrests, 
the rumors continued. For two 
weeks sporadic outbreaks of the 
fever occurred, and then, abruptly, they ceased. 

TT was more than a week after 
the last case had been reported 
that David sat in his basement 
laboratory beside the opened 
mouse cage, watching with wry 
affection as the furry creatures 
crawled over his hand. These 
were historic mice, he reflected, 
whose reactions to SDE had 



CATEGORY PHOENIX 



35 



opened up a new world, a world 
which he must somehow help to 
make better than the present one. 

His three colleagues had returned a few days ago from their 
holiday. They had calmly come 
back to work, and apparently 
nobody had thought to put two 
and two together, and thus connect the epidemic with the vacationers. It had been unfortunate 
that Tanya should have been put 
under arrest; it was difficult trying to find amusement for Leah 
so that she would keep out of 
sight, but still, on the whole, 
their luck had been good. 

But it was time for David to 
go back to work in his office. 
Gently he detached the mice 
from his hand, dropped them 
into* their cage, and closed the 
wire trap. He took his leather 
pencil case and the keys to his 
desk from the pocket of his lab 
coat and laid them on the desk, 
below the nail on which his 
wristwatch hung. Carelessly he 
dropped his lab coat onto the 
desk and reached for his jacket, 
then paused, listening. 

The chatter in the technicians' 
room suddenly died. In the unnatural quiet sounded a steady 
march of feet. 

David turned to meet the probing black eyes of Leader Marley. 
Just behind him were Dr. Lanza 
and Officer Magnun. 

There was no time to conceal 



his mice, David realized. Shrugging into his jacket, he strode 
forward without hesitation, a 
smile on his face, and stretched 
out his hand. 

"Leader Marley! This is indeed an honor. If you had only 
notified us of your visit, we 
should have been prepared." 

"Young as ever, I see, Wong." 

"Thank you. Leader." There 
was no banter in Marley's eyes, 
he noted, but he continued amiably. "It has been some years 
since you have honored us by a 
visit in person. I'm afraid a laboratory is not a very exciting 
place, but I'd be honored to show 
you anything that may be of interest to you." 

A faint contempt curled Marley's mouth as he glanced around 
the room. "Nothing to see -that 
I haven't seen before, is there? 
A lot of test tubes, a bunch of 
flasks, a mess of apparatus you'd 
think had been dreamed up by 
an idiot, and a bad smell. You 
still keep animals, I notice." 

He sauntered over to the 
bench, picked up the cage and 
looked at the scurrying rodents. 

David scarcely breathed. 

Marley only nodded. "Well, 
mice are mice." He put down the 
cage and turned away. "These 
look just like the ones I saw 
when I was here eight or ten 
years ago. Same white patch on 
the forelimbs. I never knew mice 



GAIAXY SCIENCI FICTION 



could live that long." 

"But — " began Lanza, bending 
over to study the mice. 

"What an amazing memory 
you have. Leader," said David. 
"Just as you guessed, these mice 
are the direct descendants of the 
ones you saw on your former 
visit, a special mutant strain. The 
chief difference is that these are 
marked with white patches on 
the right forelimbs, while, as I 
am sure you recall, the original 
specimens were marked on the 
left forelimbs. Odd how these 
marks run in families, isn't it?" 

Lanza put down the cage and 
strolled toward the door as Marley took a last bored look around. 

"Nothing new here that I ought 
to see, Lanza?" 

"No. Nothing new." 

"Well, I've no time to waste. 
I've come here for two reasons. 
Dr. Wong. We both want a 
booster shot for Blue Martian. 
Ten years is a long time, and 
there's been this epidemic." 

"Which is now under control." 

"That may be, but I still want 
a booster. You Research people 
don't always know as much as 
you think you do. When that's 
done, I want a detailed report of 
your progress on White Martian." 

"I shall be hapy to give it," 
said David. "If you will go directly to my office, I'll pick up 
the vaccine and syringes, and be 



with you in a few minutes.** 

Marley and Officer Magnun 
marched to the door, and David 
followed, standing aside to let 
Lanza precede him. Lanza hesitated there, staring at the floor. 
Then he smiled and looked directly at David. 

"Beautiful spring weather we 
are having. I*m wondering about 
the marvelous order of nature. 
Did you happen to notice, this 
morning, whether the Sun did 
actually rise in the east?" 

David stared at the retreating 
back. There was no longer any 
doubt in his mind. Lanza knew. 
What was he going to do? 

"Hurry up, Doctor," said Officer Magnun from the doorway. 

"Right away." He opened the 
refrigerator and inspected the 
two groups of red-capped vials 
sitting on the shelf. He had no 
time to think, no time to weigh 
pros and cons; he could only act. 
Choosing two vials, he added 
them to the sterile kit from the 
autoclave, and took a last look 
around. 

He noticed his watch still hanging on the wall, and the lab coat 
which covered his leather pencil case. He started to take them, 
then slowly dropped his hand 
and touched the intercom. 

"Get me Dr. Karl Haslam." 

"You're keeping the Leader 
waiting," said Magnun, but 
David paid no attention. 



CATEGORY' PHOENIX 



"Dr. Haslam? Dr. Wong 
speaking. I may be a little late 
getting up to see those precipitates of yours. But you keep 
them simmering, just in case. It's 
very probable that the antibody 
curve will rise. . . . Yes, I'll let 
you know if I can." 

Magnun followed him to the 
office, then strolled away for a 
chat with Watchguard Jones. 

David put his things on his 
desk and made his preparations 
in businesslike fashion while 
Marley and Lanza glanced curiously around the office. He 
watched apprehensively as Marley inspected the bookcase, then 
turned away. 

"I never could understand why 
Research needs so many books," 
he*remarked. 

1 "Please roll up your sleeve, 
Leader Marley. I'm ready for 
you now." 

Deftly he assembled the syringe, 'filled it to the two centimeter mark, and scrubbed the 
arm presented to him. 

"Ready?" He inserted the 
needle and slowly expelled the 
fluid. Then, taking a fresh syringe, he repeated the operation, 
filling from the second vial. 

"Why do those bottles have 
different numbers?" asked Marley. "Aren't we getting the same 
thing?" 

"Certainly. Just lab routine, 
to we can keep track of how 



many units have been used from 
our stock. There, that does it, 
Lanza. Both of you will' be perfectly safe for a good many years 
to come." 

He was washing his hands at 
the sink when he heard a struggle at the door. Turning, he saw 
Leah, thin, gaunt and terrified, 
held fast in the grip of Officer 
Magnun, who forced her inside 
and slammed the door behind 
them. 

"What's the meaning of this 
intrusion?" demanded Marley. 

"There's some funny business 
going on, Leader," said Magnun. 
"I caught this woman trying to 
sneak in here. She says she's 
Miss Hachovnik and she works 
here. Only she ain't. I arrested 
Miss Hachovnik myself, and I 
remember well enough what she 
looked like. She was a cute chick, 
not a bit like this dame." 

Marley was staring at the sobbing girl, eyes blinking as he 
thought, looked back, remembered. Slowly his eyes shifted to 
David, and David felt like a man 
impaled. 

"You may leave, Magnun," 
said the Leader. 

"You don't want me to arrest 
this woman?" 

"Let go of her! I said you may 
leave!" 

"As you say, Leader." 

When the door closed, the 
room throbbed to Leah's sobs.

"I couldn't help it, Dr. Wong," 
she cried. "I got so bored, sitting 
and looking at those books, day 
after day, with nothing to do! I 
thought I'd just slip down here 
for an hour and say hello to 
people, and — " 

"Quiet, Hachovnik!" roared 
Marley. He quieted his voice. "I 
understand now, Wong. I remember. There were two girls. Twins. 
The one in Psycho- detention, according to Officer Magnun, is still 
beautiful and young. It's no use, 
Wong. You do know the secret 
of immortality. And you told me 
the Phoenix was only a fairy 
tale!" 

DAVID felt entirely calm. 
Whatever might happen now, 
at least the suspense was over. 
He had done all he could, and it 
was a relief to have things in the 
open. He thought fleetingly of 
his colleagues, alerted by his 
message, frantically putting their 
plans into operation, but he 
leaned back against the sink with 
every appearance of ease. 

"You're not quite right, Leader 
Marley. I cannot confer immortality. All I am able to do is 
stave off the aging process." 

"That will do me nicely. And 
it's connected somehow with the 
Blue Martian virus?" 

"Yes. The disease serves as the 
vehicle." 

With a brisk motion, Marley 



drew his needier from his breast 
pocket and aimed it steadily at 
David, "Give it to me!" 

"You're rather ambiguous," 
said David. How were his friends 
getting along? Were they ready 
yet? Had Karl visited the basement lab? "Do you mean you 
want me to give you the injection 
to prolong your life, or the secret 
of how to do it, or what?" 

"Don't quibble ! First you'll 
give me the injection to make 
me immortal. Then you'll turn 
over to me all your notes on procedure. Then my friend here will 
needle you with a shaft of electrons and end your interest in 
the problem." 

"Surely you won't keep such 
a good thing all for yourself," 
said David. "What about Dr. 
Lanza? He's your right-hand 
man. Don't you want him to 
live forever, too? What about 
Officer Magnun? He's a faithful 
servant." 

"You're stalling, Wong. Do 
you want me to kill you now?" 

"It won't be wise to needle 
me yet, Leader Marley. The secret would be lost forever." 

"I'll have your notes!" 

"Yes? Try to read them. 
They're written in Coptic, a dead 
language that you consider it a 
waste of time to learn, because 
such knowledge is impractical. 
There aren't half a dozen men 
on Earth who could make head

or tail of my notebook." 

"Then I'll find that half-dozen! 
I want the injection." He gestured with the gleaming weapon. 

"This is once when I have no 
Free Choice," said David. "Very 
well." He started toward the 
door, but halted at the roar of 
command. 

"Stop! Do you think I'm fool 
enough to let you out of my 
sight?" 

"But I have to get the inoculant." 

"Use the intercom. Send for 
it." 

David slumped into the chair 
and opened the intercom. He 
could almost feel the electronic 
shaft of the needier ripping into 
his body. His heart beat wildly, 
arM the tension of adrenalin ran 
through his body. His Hps felt 
cold, but he held them steady as 
he spoke into the dial. 

"Get me Dr. Haslam. . . . 
Karl? David Wong speaking. 
Will you send someone up with 
a vial of phoenix special ? 
The precipitates? I should say 
the antibody titer has reached the 
danger point. Don't delay treatment any longer." 

Silently thpy waited. Marley's 
grim face did not relax; his eyes 
were alight. Leah lay back in her 
chair with closed eyes, and Lanza 
stared intently at the floor. 

A soft knock came at the door, 
and a female technician hurried 



in, carrying a tray. 

"I'm sorry to be so slow. Dr. 
Wong. Dr. Haslam had a little 
trouble locating the right vial. 
Oh, and he said to tell you not 
to worry about those precipitates. 
They're taken care of." 

"Just a minute," said David. 
"Leader Marley, Miss Hachovnik here is very ill. Won't you let 
this girl help her to the rest 
room? She'll be safe there until 
you're ready for her." 

Marley looked at the halffainting woman. "All right. You 
take her there, Lanza, and this 
girl too. Lock them in. And she's 
not to talk. Do you understand? 
She's not to talk!" 

"As you say, Leader Marley," 
the technician whispered. She 
helped Leah to her feet, and 
Lanza followed them from the 
room. 

Marley closed the door and 
locked it. "Now, then, Wong, 
give me that shot, and heaven 
help you if you try any tricks!" 

"Will you bare your arm while 
I prepare the syringe?" 

Awkwardly hanging onto the 
needier, Marley tugged at his 
sleeve while David calmly picked 
up a bottle of colorless liquid and 
filled his syringe. He turned to 
the Leader, swabbed his arm, 
then picked up the syringe. 

"There you are," said David. 

Jerking the syringe upward, he 
forced a thin jet of pure alcohol

into the man's eyes. Marley 
screamed. Agonizing pain blinded 
him. and as he clutched at his 
eyes, David snatched the needier 
from the writhing fingers, and 
flashed the electronic dagger 
straight to the heart. 

He stared at the twitching 
body for only an instant. People 
were pounding on the door, 
shouting. He tugged at the desk 
drawer to get his notebook, then 
remembered sickly that he had 
left his keys in the tab. He would 
have to leave his notes. 

The shouts were growing 
louder, people were battering the 
door. Swiftly he moved to the 
bookcase, gn ung it away from 
the wall, and dropped into darkness. 

He brought the bookcase back, 
then turned and ran along the 
black passageway. 

T EADER Lanza sat in his suite 
at State House, conferring 
with his subordinates. 

"It hardly seems possible, 
Magnun, that so many people 
could have slipped through your 
fingers without help from the 
Military. You say both the Hachovnik twins have disappeared?" 

"Yes. Leader." 

"And how many people from 
the Institute?" 

"Six, Leader. But it didn't do 
them any good. We got them, all 
right." 



"But you found no bodies!" 

"They wouldn't have bodies 
after we got through with them. 
Leader." 

"You're quite certain. Officer 
Magnun, that all the fugitives 
were destroyed?" 

Lanza looked tired, and his 
officers noticed in him a lack of 
firmness, an indecision, to which 
they were not accustomed in a 
Leader. 

"Say. those babies never had 
a chance, Leader. We picked up 
tlu-ir roboplanes somewhere over 
Kansas, and we shot them out 
of the air like ducks. They didn't 
even fire back. They just crashed, 
burned, disintegrated. They won't 
give you any more. trouble. Why, 
we even picked up the remains 
of Doc Wong's wristwatch and 
that old beat-up pencil case of 
his." He flung them on the desk. 

Lanza fingered the charred and 
molten relics. 

"That will do. Magnun. Ill 
call you when I need you." 

"Say. ain't you feeling well. 
Leader? You look kind of green." 

"That will be all, Magnun!" 

"As you say, Leader." 

Lanza shoved aside the charred 
remnants and spread out the 
papers waiting for him. the unimportant, miscellaneous notes 
accumulated over the years by 
Hudson, Faure, and Haslam. 
And the unreadable notebook of 
David Wong. He sighed and 



CATEGORY PHOENIX 



41 



looked up as his secretary entered. 

"I'm sorry to disturb you, 
Leader. You look tired." 

"The funeral this morning was 
quite an ordeal, and so much has 
happened the last three days!" 

"Wall, I thought you ought to 



know that strange reports arc 
coming in. Some of our most 
prominent citizens have disappeared. We're trying to trace 
them, of course, but — " 

"Anything more?" 

"Those rumors about Blue 
Martian are cropping up again." 




"Yes? And—?" 

"That old man you asked me 
to tiring from the Vermont quarries, the one who was detained 
for illegal study of the Coptic 
language? Well, I guess the excitement of his release was too 
much for him. He died of a heart 
attack when he was being taken 
to the plane." 

Lanza sighed. "Very well, that 
will be all." 

Alone at last, he looked sadly 
through the pages of David's 
notebook, at the tantalizing curls 
and angles of the Coptic letters, 
cryptic symbols of a discovery 
which prevented a man from 
growing old. Well, no one could 
read them now. That secret was 
dead, along with its discoverer, 
because, in this world, no study 
was permitted without a practical 
end in view. And perhaps it was 
just as well. Could any man be 
trusted, he wondered, to deal 
wisely with a power so great? 

After closing the notebook, he 
dropped his head into his hands. 

How his head ached! He felt 
cold, suddenly, and his whole 
body began to shake with a hard 
chill. He lifted his head, his vision blurred, and suddenly he 
knew. 

He had Blue Martian fever! 

Teeth chattering, he paced 
wildly about the room, puzzling 
things out, trying to remember. 
That booster shot! And then he

.Ki. (We 



realized the amazing truth: 
David Wong had given him a 
chance! He had inoculated him 
with the seeds of immortality, 
giving him a chance to help right 
the wrongs of this Categorized 
world. And now he was left alone 
in a world of mortals. David and 
the others had been annihilated, 
and he was left to live on and 
on, alone. 

He steggered toward his private apartments, then sank into 
his chair as his secretary once 
again ran into the room. With a 
supreme effort he controlled his 
trembling. 

"Yes?" 

"Leader Lanza. Another report." 

Hgust a minute," said Lanza, 
trying to bring his eyes into focus 
on the excited girl. "I am in need 
of a rest. As soon as you have 
gone, I shall retire into seclusion 
for a few days. There are to be 
no interruptions. Is that clear? 
Now, proceed." 

"There's a new epidemic of 
Martian Fever reported where 
one never was before." 

He stirred ti redly. "Where 
now?" 

"South America. Somewhere in 
the Andes." 

"I think we'll have just one 
Category after this," said Lanza 



dreamily. "Category Phoenix." 

"What did you say, Leader?" 

His thoughts wandered. No 
wonder Magnun's men found no 
bodies. The planes they shot 
down were roboplanes, after all, 
and it was easy to plant in an 
empty seat a man's wristwatch 
and his bulky leather pencil case. 
David and the others were safe 
now. They were free and had 
enough time to plan for the new 
free world. 

"What did you say, Leader?" 
the girl repeated, bewildered. 

"Nothing. -It doesn't matter." 
He frowned painfully, and then 
shrugged. "On second thought, I 
may be away longer than a week. 
If anyone asks for me, say I'm 
on an Aimless Tramp. I've always hoped that some day I 
might earn the right to a Free 
Choice." 

"But you're the Leader," the 
girl said in astonishment. "You're 
entitled to all the Free Choices 
you want!" 

He lifted his twitching head, 
smiling wanly. "It would seem 
that way, wouldn't it? Well, 
whether I am or not, I think I've 
really earned a Free Choice. I 
wonder," he said in a wistful 
voice, "whether the climate in 
the Andes is hospitable."

LOST MEMORY 



By PETER PHILLIPS 



Naturally, any sick person should be given 
medical help, even if he's from space. But 
what if he could not ever have been alive? 



I COLLAPSED joints and 
hung up to talk with 
Dak-whirr. He blinked his 
eyes iri some discomfort. 

"What do you want, Palil?" 
he asked complainingly. 
"As if you didn't know." 
**I can't give you permission to 
examine it. The thing is being 



saved for inspection by the board. 
What guarantee do I have that 
you won't spoil it for them?" 

I thrust confidentially at one 
of his body-plates. "Voi^owe me 
a favor." I said. "Remember?" 

"That was a long time in the 
past."

tions and a reassembly ago. If it 
wasn't for me, you'd be eroding 
in a pit. All I want is a quick 
look at its thinking part. I'll vrull 
the consciousness without laying 
a single pair of pliers on it." 

He went into a feedback twitch, 
an indication of the conflict between his debt to me and his selfconceived duty. 

Finally he said, "Very well, 
but keep tuned to me. If I warn 
that a board member is coming, 
remove yourself quickly. Anyway 
how do you know it has consciousness? It may be mere primal 
metal." 

"In that form? Don't be foolish. 
It's obviously a manufacture. And 
I'm not conceited enough to believe that we are the only form 
of intelligent manufacture in the 
Universe." 

"Tautologous phrasing, Palil" 
Dak-whirr said pedantically. 
"There could not conceivably be 
•unintelligent manufacture.* There 
can be no consciousness without 
manufacture, and no manufacture 
without intelligence. Therefore 
there can be no consciousness 
without intelligence. Now if you 
should wish to dispute — " 

1 tuned off his frequency 
abruptly and hurried away. Dakwhirr is a fool and a bore. Everyone knows there's a fault in his 
logic circuit, but he refuses to 
have it traced down and repaired. 
Very unintelligent of him. 



^T^HE thing had been taken into 
one of the museum sheds by 
the carriers. I gazed at it in admiration for some moments. It 
was quite beautiful, having suffered only slight exterior damage, 
and it was obviously no mere 
conglomeration of sky metal. 

In fact, I immediately thought 
of it as "he" and endowed it 
with the attributes of self-knowing, although, of course, his consciousness could not be functioning or he would have attempted 
communication with us. 

I fervently hoped that the 
board, after his careful disassembly and study, could restore his 
awareness so that he could tell 
us himself which solar system he 
came from. 

Imagine it! He had achieved 
our dream of many thousands of 
revolutions — space flight — only to 
be fused, or worse, in his moment of triumph. 

I felt a surge of sympathy for 
the lonely traveler as he lay 
there, still, silent, non-emitting. 
Anyway, I mused, even if we 
couldn't restore him to selfknowing, an analysis of his construction .might give us the secret 
of the power he had used to 

achieve the velocity to esc<ip< hi* 
planet's gravity. 

In shape and size he was not 
unlike Swen — or Swen Two, as 
he called himself after his conversion — who failed so disas



 



trously to reach our satellite, using chemical fuels. But where 
Swen Two had placed his tubes, 
the stranger had a curious helical 
construction studded at irregular 
intervals with small crystals. 

He was thirty-five feet tall, a 
gracefully tapering cylinder. 
Standing at his head, I could find 
no sign of exterior vision cells, 
so I assumed he had some kind 
of vrulling sense. There seemed 
to be no exterior markings at all, 
except the long, shallow grooves 
dented in his skin by scraping to 
a stop along the hard surface of 
our planet. 

I am a reporter with warm current in my wires, not a coldthinking scientist, so I hesitated 
before using my own vrulling 
sense. Even though the stranger 
was non-aware-^-perhaps permanently — I felt it would be a presumption, an invasion of privacy. 
There was nothing else I could 
do. though, of course. 

I started to vrull, gently at 
first, then harder, until I was 
positively glowing with effort. It 
was incredible; his skin seemed 
absolutely impermeable. 

The sudden realization that 
metal could be so alien nearly 
fused something inside me. I 
found myself backing away in 
horror, my self-preservation -relay working overtime. 

Imagine watching one of the 
beautiful cone-rod -and- cylinder 



assemblies performing the Dance 
of the Seven Spanners, as he's 
conditioned to do. and then suddenly refusing to do anything except stump around unattractively, 
or even becoming obstinately motionless, unresponsive. That might 
give you an idea of how I felt 
in that dreadful moment. 

Then I remembered Dakwhirr's words — there could be no 
such thing as an "unintelligent 
manufacture." And a product so 
beautiful could surely not be evil. 
I overcame my repugnance and 
approached again. 

I halted as an open transmission came from someone near at 
hand. 

"Who gave that squeaking reporter permission to snoop around 
here?" 

I had forgotten the museum 
board. Five of them were standing 
in the doorway of the shed, radiating anger. I recognized Chirik, 
the chairman, and addressed myself to him. I explained that I'd 
interfered with nothing and 
pleaded for permission on behalf 
of my subscribers to watch their 
investigation of the stranger. 
After some argument, they al* 
lowed me to stay. 

I watched in silence and some 
amusement as one by one they 
tried to vrull the silent being from 
space. Each showed the same reaction as myself when they. failed 
to penetrate the skin.

Chirik, who is wheeled — and 
inordinately vain about his suspension system — flung himself 
back on his supports and pretended to be thinking. 

"Fetch Fiff-fiff," he said at last. 
"The creature may still be aware, 
but unable to communicate on 
our standard frequencies.'* 

TTMFF-FIFF can detect anything in any spectrum. Fortunately he was at work in the 
museum that day and soon arrived in answer to the call. He 
stood silently near the stranger 
for some moments, testing and 
adjusting himself, then slid up 
the electromagnetic band
"He's emitting," he said. 

"Why can't we get him?" asked 
Chirik. 

"It's a curious signal on an unusual band." 

"Well, what does he say?'* 

"Sounds like utter nonsense to 
me. Wait, I'll relay and convert 
it to standard." 

I made a direct recording naturally, like any good reporter. 

" — after planetfall," the 
■hunger was saying. "Last dribble

pick this up, but can't get a fix in 
time, give my love to the boys in 
the mess. Signing off for another 
couple of hours, but keeping this 
channel open and hoping ..." 

"The fall must have deranged 
him," said Chirik, gazing at the 
stranger. "Can't he see us or hear 
us?" 

"He couldn't hear you properly 
before, but he can now, through 
me," Fiff-fiff pointed out. "Say 
something to him, Chirik." 

"Hello," said Chirik doubtfully. "Er — welcome to our planet. 
We are sorry you were hurt by 
your fall. We offer you the hospitality of our assembly shops. 
You will feel better when you 
are repaired and repo wered. I f 
you will indicate how we can 
assist you — " 

"What the hell! What ship is 
that? Where are you?" 

."We're here," said Chirik. 
"Can't you see us or vrull us? 
Your vision circuit is impaired, 
perhaps? Or do you depend entirely on vrulling? We can't find 
your eyes and assumed either 
that you protected them in some 
way during flight, or dispensed 
with vision cells altogether in 
your conversion." 

Chirik hesitated, continued 
apologetically : "But we cannot 
understand how you vrull, either. 



41 




 



While we thought that you were 
unaware, or even completely 
fused, we tried to vrull you. 
Your skin is quite impervious to 
us, however." 

The stranger said: "I don't 
know if you're batty or I am. 
What distance are you from me?" 

Chirik measured quickly. "One 
meter, two-point-five centimeters 
from my eyes to your nearest 
point. Within touching distance, 
in fact." Chirik tentatively put 
out his hand. "Can you not feel 
me, or has your contact sense 
also been affected?" 

It became obvious that the 
stranger had been pitifully deranged. I reproduce his words 
phonetically from my record, although some of them make little 
sense. Emphasis, punctuative 
pauses and spelling of unknown 
terms are mere guesswork, of 
course. 

He said: "For godsakemann 
stop talking nonsense, whoever 
you are. If you're outside, can't 
you see the airlock is jammed? 
Can't shift it myself. I'm badly 
hurt. Get me out of here, please." 

"Get you out of where?" Chirik 
looked around, puzzled. "We 
brought you into an open shed 
near our museum for a preliminary examination. Now that we 
know you're intelligent, we shall 
immediately take you to our 
assembly shops for healing and 
recuperation. Rest assured that 

IOST MEMORY 



you'll have the best possible attention." 

rriHERE was a lengthy pause 
before the stranger spoke 
again, and his words were slow 
and deliberate. His bewilderment 
is understandable, I believe, if we 
remember that he could not sec, 
vrull or feel. 

He asked: "What manner of 
creature are you? Describe yourself.** 

Chirik turned to us and made 
a significant gesture toward his 
thinking part, indicating gently 
that the injured stranger had to 
be humored. 

"Certainly," he replied. "I am 
an unspecialized bipedal manufacture of standard proportions, 
lately self- converted to wheeled 
traction, with a hydraulic suspension system of my own devising which I'm sure will interest 
you when we restore your sense 
circuits." 

There was an even longer silence. 

"You are robots," the stranger 
said at last. "Crise knows how 
you got here or why you speak 
Inglish, but you must try to understand me. I am mann. I am 
a friend of your master, your 
maker. You must fetch him to me 
at once." 

"You are not well," said Chirik 
firmly. "Your speech is incoherent 
and without meaning. Your fall 

49 



has obviously caused several serious feedbacks of a very serious 
nature. Please lower your voltage. 
We are taking you to our 
shops immediately. Reserve your 
strength to assist our specialists 
as best you can in diagnosing 
your troubles." 

"Wait. You must understand. 
You are — ogodno that's no good. 
Have you no memory of matin? 
The words you use — what meaning have they for you? Manufacture — made by hand hand 
hand damyou. Healing. Metal is

out there listen." 

"Out where?" asked Prrr-chuk, 
deputy chairman of the museum 
board. 

I shook my head sorrowfully. 
This was nonsense, but, like any 
good reporter, I kept my recorder 
running. 

The mad words flowed on. 
"You call me he. Why? You have 
no seks. You are knewter. You are

and made sentient slaves of his 
machines and saw the wonden 
of a million worlds, only this 
miserable representative hai to 
die in lonely desperation on a far 
planet, hearing goblin voices in 
the darkness." 

HERE my recorder reproduce! 
a most curious sound, as 
though the stranger were using an 
ancient type of vibratory molecular vocalizer in a gaseou 
dium to reproduce his words 
before transmission, and the insulation on his diaphragm had 
come adrift. 

It was a jerky, high-pitched, 
strangely disturbing sound: but 
in a moment the fault was corrected and the stranger resumed 
transmission. 

"Does blud mean anything to 
you?" 

"No," Chirik replied simply. 
"Or deth?" 
"No."-. 
"Or wor?" 

"Quite meaningless." 

"What is your origin? How did 
you come into being?" 

"There are several theories." 
Chirik said. "The most popular 
one — which is no more than a 



• A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



grossly unscientific legend, in my 
opinion — is that our manufacturer fell from the skies, imbedded in a mass of primal metal on 
which He drew to erect the first 
assembly shop. How He came 
into being is lejt to conjecture. 
My own theory, however — " 

"Does legend mention the shape 
of this primal metal?" 

"In vague terms, yes. It was 
cylindrical, of vast dimensions." 

"An interstellar vessel," said 
the stranger. 

"That is my view also," said 
Chirik complacently. "And — " 

"What was the supposed appearance of your — manufacturer?" 

"He is said to have been of 
magnificient proportions, based 
harmoniously on a cubical plan, 
static in Himself, but equipped 
with a vast array of senses." 

"An- automatic computer," said 
the stranger. 

He made more curious noises, 
less jerky and at a lower pitch 
than the previous sounds. 

He corrected the fault and went 
on: "God that's funny. A ship 
falls, menn are no more, and an 
automatic computer has pupps. 
Oh, yes, it fits in. A self-setting 
computer and navigator, operating on verbal orders. It learns to 
listen for itself and know itself 
for what it is, and to absorb 
knowledge. It comes to hate menn 
— or at least their bad qualities 



— so it deliberately crashes the 
ship and pulps their puny bodies 
with a calculated nicety of shock. 
Then it propagates and does a 
dam fine job of selective erasure 
on whatever it gave its pupps to 
use for a memory. It passes on 
only the good it found in menn, 
and purges the memory of him 
completely. Even purges all of 
his vocabulary except scientific 
terminology. Oil is thicker than 
blud. So may they live without 
the burden of knowing that they 
are — ogod they must know, 
they must understand. You outside, what happened to this manufacturer?" 

Chirik, despite his professed 
disbelief in the supernormal aspects of the ancient story, automatically made a visual sign of 
sorrow. 

"Legend has it," he said, "that 
after completing His task. He 
fused himself beyond possibility 
of healing." 

A BRUPT, low-pitched noises 
came again from the 
stranger. "Yes. He would. Just 
in case any of His pupps should 
give themselves forbidden knowledge and an infeeryorrity komplecks by probing his mnemonic 
circuits. The perfect self-sacrificing muther. What sort of environment did He give you? 
Describe your planet." 

Chirik looked around at us

again in bewilderment, but he 
replied courteously, giving the 
stranger a description of our 
world. 

"Of course," said the stranger. 
"Of course. Sterile rock and metal 
suitable only for you. But there 
must be some way. . ." 

He was silent for a while. 

"Do you know what growth 
means?" he asked finally. "Do 
you have anything that grows?" 

"Certainly," Chirik said helpfully. "If we should suspend a 
crystal of some substance in a 
saturated solution of the same 
element or compound — ** 

"No, no," the stranger interrupted. "Have you nothing that 
grows of itself, that fruktiffies 
arM gives increase without your 
intervention?" 

"How could such a thing be?" 

"Criseallmytee I should have 
guessed. If you had one blade of 
gras. just one tiny blade of growing gras, you could extrapolate 
from that to me. Green things, 
things that feed on the rich brest 
of erth, cells that divide and 
multiply, a cool grove of treez 
in a hot summer, with tiny warmbludded burds preening their 
fethers among the leeves; a feeld 
of spring weet with newbawn mise 
timidly threading the dangerous 
jungul of storks; a stream of 
living water where silver fish dart 
and pry and feed and procreate; a 
farm yard where things grunt and 



cluck and greet the new day with 
the stirring pulse of life, with a 
surge of blud. Blud — " 

For some inexplicable reason, . 
although the strength of his 
carrier wave remained almost 
constant, the stranger's transmission seemed to be growing fainter. 

"His circuits are failing," Chirik said. "Call the carriers. We 
must take him to an assembly 
shop immediately. I wish he 
would reserve his power." 

My presence with the museum 
board was accepted without question now. I hurried along with 
them as the stranger was carried 
to the nearest shop. 

I now noticed a circular marking in that part of his skin on 
which he had been resting, and 
guessed that it was some kind 
of orifice through which he would 
have extended his planetary traction mechanism if he had not 
been injured. 

He was gently placed on a 
disassembly cradle. The doctor in 
charge that day was Chur-chur, 
an old friend of mine. He had 
been listening to the two-way 
transmissions and was already 
acquainted with the case. 

CHUR-CHUR walked thoughtfully around the stranger. 
''We shall have to cut," he said. 
"It won't pain him, since his 
intra-molecular pressure and contact senses have failed. But since 



52 




 



we can't vrull him, it'll be necessary for him to tell us where 
his main brain is housed or we 
might damage it." 

Fiff-fiff was still relaying, But 
no amount of power boost would 
make the stranger's voice any 
clearer. It was quite faint now, 
and there are places on my recorder tape from which I cannot 
make even the roughest phonetic 
transliteration. 

"... strength going. Can't get 
into my zoot . . . done for if 
they bust through lock, done for 
if they don't . . . must tell them 
I need oxygen . . ." 

"He's in bad shape, desirous of 
extinction," I remarked to Churchur, who was adjusting his arccutter. "He wants to poison himself with oxidation now." 

I shuddered at the thought of 
that vile, corrosive gas he had 
mentioned, which causes that almost unmentionable condition we 
all fear — rust. 

Chirik spoke firmly through 
Fiff-fiff. "Where is your thinking 
part, stranger? Your central 
brain?" 

"In my heed," the stranger replied. "In my head ogod my 
head . . . eyes blurring everything going dim , , , luv to mairee 
. . . kids ... a carry me home to the 
lone prayree . . . get this bluddy 
airlock open then they'll see me 
die . . . but they'll see me . . . 
some kind of atmosphere with 



this gravity . . . see me die . . . 
extrapolate from body what I 
was . . . what they are damthem 
damthem damthem . . . niann 
. . . master . . . i am your maker!" 

For a few seconds the voice rose 
strong and clear, then faded away 
again and dwindled into a combination of those two curious 
noises I mentioned earlier. For 
some reason that I cannot explain, I found the combined sound 
very disturbing despite its faintness. It may be that it induced 
some kind of sympathetic oscillation. 

Then came words, largely incoherent and punctuated by a 
kind of surge like the sonic vibrations produced by variations 
of pressure in a leaking gas-filled 
vessel. 

"... done it . . . crawling into 
chamber, closing inner . . . must 
be mad . . . they'd find me anyway . . . but finished . . . want see 
them before I die . . . want see 
them see me . . . liv few seconds, 
watch them ... get outer one 
open ..." 

Chur-chur had adjusted his arc 
to a broad, clean, blue-white 
glare. I trembled a little as he 
brought it near the edge of the 
circular marking in the stranger's 
skin. I could almost feel the disruption of the intra -molecular 
sense currents in my own skin. 

"Don't be squeamish, Palil," 
Chur-chur said kindly. "He can't 



tOST MEMORY 



feel it now that his contact sense 
has gone. And you heard him say 
that his central brain is in his 
head." He brought the cutter 
firmly up to the skin. '*I should 
have guessed that. He's the same 
shape as Swen Two, and Swen 
very logically concentrated his 
main thinking part as far away 
from his explosion chambers as 
possible." 

TJ IVULETS of metal ran down 
into a tray which a calm 
assistant had placed on the 
ground for that purpose. I averted 
my eyes quickly. I could never 
steel myself enough to be a surgical engineer or assembly technician. 

But I had to looV again, fascinated. The whole area circumscribed by the marking was beginning to glow. 

Abruptly the stranger's voice 
returned, quite strongly, each 
word clipped, emphasized, highpitched. 

"Ar no no no . . . god my hands 
. . . they're burning through the 
lock and I can't get back I can't 
get away . . . stop it you feens 
stop it can't you hear . . . I'll 
be burned to deth I'm here in 
the airlock . . . the air's getting 
hot you're burning me alive ..." 

Although the words made little 
sense, I could guess what had 
happened and I was horrified. 

"Stop, Chur-chur," I pleaded. 



"The heat has somehow brought 
back his skin currents. It's hurting him." 

Chur-chur said reassuringly: 
"Sorry, Palil. It occasionally happens during an operation — probably a local thermo-electric effect. But even if his contact senses 
have started working again and 
he can't switch them off, he won't 
have to bear this very long." 

Chirik shared my unease, however. He put out his hand and 
awkardly patted the stranger's 
skin. 

"Easy there," he said. "Cut out 
your senses if you can. If you 
can't, well, the operation is nearly 
finished. Then we'll repower you, 
and you'll soon be fit and happy 
again, healed and fitted and reassembled." 

I decided that I liked Chirik 
very much just then. He exhibited 
almost as much self-induced empathy as any reporter; he might 
even come to like my favorite 
blue stars, despite his cold scientific exactitude in most respects. 

My recorder tape shows, in its 
reproduction of certain sounds, 
how I was torn away from this 
strained reverie. 

During the one-and-a-half seconds since I had recorded the 
distinct vocables "burning me 
alive," the stranger's words had 
become quite blurred, running together and rising even higher in 
pitch until they reached a sus


LOST MEMORY 



55 



tained note — around E-flat in the 
standard sonic senile. 

It was not like a voice at all. 

This high, whining noise was 
suddenly modulated by apparent 
words, but without changing its 
pitch. Transcribing what seem to 
be words is almost impossible, as 
you can see for yourself — this is 
the closest I can come phonetically: 

"Eeee ahahmbeeeeing baked 
aliiive in an uvennn ahdeeerjeeesussunmuuutherrr ! " 

The note swooped higher and 
higher until it must have neared 
supersonic range, almost beyond 
either my direct or recorded 
hearing. 

Then it stopped as quickly as a 
contact break. 

*And although the soft hiss of 
the stranger's carrier wave carried on without perceptible diminution, indicating that some 
degree of awareness still existed, 
I experienced at that moment one 
of those quirks of intuition given 
only to reporters: 

I felt that I would never greet 
the beautiful stranger from the 
sky in his full senses. 

|~<HUR-CHUR was muttering 
to himself about the extreme 
toughness and thickness of the 
stranger's skin. He had to make 
four complete cutting revolutions 
before the circular mass of nearly 
white-hot metal could be pulled 



away by a magnetic grapple. 

A billow of smoke puffed out 
of the orifice. Despite my repugnance, I thought of my duty as 
a reporter and forced myself to 
look over Chur-chur's shoulder. 

The fumes came from a soft, 
charred, curiously shaped mass 
of something which lay just inside 
the opening. 

"Undoubtedly a kind of insulating material," Chur-chur explained. 

He drew out the crumpled 
blackish heap and placed it carefully on a tray. A small portion 
broke away, showing a red, viscid 
substance. 

"It looks complex," Chur-chur 
said, "but I expect the stranger 
will be able fo tell us how to 
reconstitute it or make a substitute." 

His assistant gently cleaned the 
Wound of the remainder of the 
material, which he placed with 
the rest; and Chur-chur resumed 
his inspection of the orifice. 

You can, if you want, read the 
technical accounts of Chur-chur's 
discovery of the stranger's double 
skin at the point where the cut 
was made; of the incredible complexity of his driving mechanism, 
involving principles which are 
still not understood to this day; 
of the museum's failure to analyze the exact nature and function of the insulating material 
found in only that one portion

of his body; and of the other 
scientific mysteries connected 
with him. 

But this is my personal, nonscientific account. I shall never 
forget hearing about the greatest 
mystery of all, for which not even 
the most tentative explanation 
has been advanced, nor the utter 
bewilderment with which Churchur announced his initial findings that day. 

He had hurriedly converted 
himself to a convenient size to 
permit actual entry into the 
stranger's body. 

When he emerged, he stood in 
silence for several minutes. Then, 
very slowly, he said: 

"I have examined the *central 
brain' in the forepart of his 
body. It is no more than a simple 
auxiliary computer mechanism. 
It does not possess the slightest 
trace of consciousness. And there 
is no other conceivable center of 
intelligence in the remainder of 
his body." 

There is something I wish I 
could forget. I can't explain why 
it should upset me so much. But 
I always stop the tape before 
it reaches the point where the 
voice of the stranger rises in pitch, 
going higher and higher until it 
cuts out. 

There's a quality about that 
noise that makes me tremble and 
think of rust.

that the name of the city was 
Thone. There were other people 
in the room with me— one person 
especially. I remembered her very 
clearly." 

"Her?" Hall asked. 

"Yes." 

"Was there anything unusual 
about this woman?" 

"Well, yes, there was," Bennett 
said, after a brief and almost 
embarrassed pause. "This will 
sound pretty adolescent, but — " 

Hall leaned forward attentively. 
"It may be relevant. You're not 
here to be judged, you know; I'm 
trying to help you." 

Bennett nodded and spoke 
rapidly, as though trying to finish before he could stop himself. 
"She was a woman who exactly 
filled an image I've had in mind 
for as long as I can remember. 
She was tall, fair — though brunette — very beautiful, very vivid, 
very well poised. I seem to have 
known her all my life, but only 
in my dreams, from my very 
earliest ones to the present. She's 
never changed in all that time." 

He halted as suddenly as he 
had begun to talk, either having 
nothing more to say, or unwilling 
to say it. 

"Have you ever married. Mr. 
Bennett?" Hall prodded gently. 

"No, I never have." Again, 
Bennett stopped, adding nothing 
more to his blunt answer. 

"May I ask why not?" 



Bennett turned his face away. 
"I was hoping you wouldn't ask 
that. It makes me sound like a 
romantic kid." He looked at the 
doctor almost in defiance. "I've 
always felt that some day I would 
meet this girl, or at least someone 
very much like her. I know it's 
not a rational feeling — maybe I've 
even used it as an excuse not 
to get married — but it's like spilling salt and throwing a pinch 
over our shoulder; we aren't 
superstitious, yet we don't take 
any chances." 

Dr. Hall didn't comment. He 
ended the questioning period and 
put Bennett through a series of 
tests. Then they sat down again 
and Hall offered his diagnosis. 

"The neurological examination 
is essentially negative, Mr. Bennett. In other words, there is no 
organic reason that I can find 
for your headaches. That leaves 
only one other possibility — an 
emotional disturbance. I'm a 
neurologist, remember, not a psychoanalyst. I can only give an 
opinion about the cause of your 
complaint." 

Bennett watted expectantly. 

"Headaches without organic 
causes are generally the result of 
repressed anger," Hall went on. 
"That anger can stem from any 
number of traumatic situations 
or attitudes, all deeply buried in 
the unconscious, of course, or 
they would not have the power

to hurt us. From what we know 
of you, however, it seems to be 
the result of frustration. In other 
words, you have created a fantasy 
image of a completely unattainable woman, and therefore none 
of the women you meet can fulfil) your expectations. Since she 
is unattainable, you naturally feel 
a sense of frustration." 

"But who could she be?" Bennett asked anxiously. 

"Someone you knew in childhood, perhaps. A composite of 
real and imaginary women. Usually, it is an idealized image of 
your own mother." 

Bennett sat frowning. "All 
right, let's say that's so. But 
where do the hallucinations of 
th# city of Thone fit in?" 

"This is something that has 
to be tracked down in a series of 
analytical sessions, so all I can 
do is guess. If one is unable to 
reach a goal in a real environment, the obvious answer is to 
create a fantasy world. That's 
what you appear to be doing. It's 
a dangerous situation. Mr. Bennett. Potentially, at least." 

"How so?" Bennett asked, 
alarmed. 

"The general tendency is toward greater and greater divorcement from reality. I suggest 
immediate treatment by a competent analyst. If you don't know 
of one, I can recommend several." 

"I'd like to think it over." 



"Do that." Hall said. "And 
call me when you've decided.** 

THE third day after he consulted the neurologist, Bennett's headache returned. As before, drugs were of no help. When 
the pain became blinding, he lay 
back on his bed, placed a cold 
cloth on his forehead, and closed 
his eyes. 

Suddenly the realities he knew 
were gone and he was back in 
the dream-city of Thone. 

Persons and objects were much 
clearer now. Bennett saw that he 
lay in a receptacle shaped like a 
rectangular metal box. It was 
padded, reminding him unpleasantly of a coffin. The woman he 
had seen before was again with 
him, but now he knew that her 
name was Lima. Behind her 
stood a man; a tall, dark man 
whose eyebrows joined over the 
bridge of his nose, and whose 
forehead was creased in a permanent frown. The woman held 
out her arms to Bennett. Her lips 
moved, but no sound came from 
tfiem. 

Bennett's spirit seemed to rise 
from the. flesh — he could see his 
body still lying there — and he 
followed the woman. As he approached she retreated and, try 
as he would to reach her, she remained just beyond his grasp. 

After what seemed hours of 
futile pursuit, a cloud formed be


*0 




 



tween him and the woman. When 
it dissipated, he had left the 
world of Thone. He was in a 
trolley-bus, in his own world, and 
vaguely he recalled having left 
his room, gone down to the street, 
and boarded the trolley — during 
the time he had followed Lima, 
in his hallucination. It seemed 
that he had a definite destination 
then, but now he could not recall 
what it had been. 

His attention was drawn to the 
outside by the flickering of lights 
that flashed in through the bus 
windows. Bennett looked out and 
saw that he was in the Pleasure 
Section of the city, traveling 
through the Street of Carnivals. 
He watched the fronts of the 
amusement buildings pass before 
him and he read their advertisements listlessly. 

Suddenly one sign seemed to 
spring out from all the others; 

LIMA 

MYSTIC OF THE MIND 

He left the trolley at the next 
corner and made his way through 
the crowd to the brightly lit carnival building. 

Inside, he found a chair and 
seated himself. The show's act 
appeared about half over. It was 
pretty evidently charlatan stuff, 
Bennett decided, but the blackhooded mystic on the stage held 
his attention. She was a tall 



woman, with a slender figure and 
fair flesh. She was poised, or perhaps it was indifference to the 
crowd. * 

A runner went through the audience touching articles of clothing or ornaments, and the woman 
without hesitation named each 
one he touched. The act was 
slightly different from most Bennett had seen in that the runner 
said nothing, merely touching the 
articles to be named. 

The next portion of the show 
consisted of a mind-reading act. 
Bennett expected the usual routine of writing a question on 
paper, which would be sealed in 
an envelope and placed in a container on the stage. 

He was surprised when the 
runner returned to the crowd and 
asked for volunteers for thoughtreading. 

A shorr* man with a bright 
yellow necktie raised his hand. 
The runner made his way through 
the crowd to the man and touched 
him on the shoulder before turning back to the mystic. He still 
said nothing. 

"This man is thinking that he 
should have stayed at home tonight," the mystic said. "There 
are wrestling matches on the teletone, and he would have enjoyed 
them more than this show. Besides, he would have spent less 
money that way than he has 
tonight. And he does not like to 



WHEELS WITHIN 



•pend money unless he must.** 
A titter of amusement went 

through the crowd as the man 

blushed a dull crimson. 

The runner touched a second 

man. 

"This man wishes to know the 
winner in the eighth race at the 
horse tracks tomorrow," she said. 
"I am sorry, but. because of Public Law one thousand thirty-two, 
Section five-A, I am prohibited 
from answering a question of 
that nature." 

The third person contacted was 
a woman. She raised her hand, 
then half changed her mind when 
she saw that the runner was 
turning toward her. But then she 
defiantly tossed her brown hair 
ba«k from her face and allowed 
him to touch her shoulder. 

"This woman is wondering if 
her lover is true to her — and if 
her husband will find out about 
them." 

This time the crowd laughed 
when the embarrassed woman 
turned pale and rushed up the 
aisle toward the exit. 

No further hands were raised 
and the show ended with a short 
address by the runner: "I hope 
you have enjoyed these truly marvelous and mysterious demonstrations. Now the mystic, Lima, 
is available for a short time for 
personal interviews. The fee is 
very reasonable — one dollar a 
minute. Anyone wishjng an inter


view please step forward.** 

The mystic pulled the hood 

from her head, smiled, bowed at 

the crowd, and left the stage. 
Bennett gasped. 
"The woman of the city of 

Thone!" 

""%7'OU have paid in advance for 
twenty-five minutes of my 
time," Lima said, as she smiled in 
amusement. "Perhaps you had 
better begin your questions, instead of merely staring at me.** 

Bennett brought his thoughts 
back with an effort. "Your 
performance was exceptionally 
good," he said very soberly. "I 
enjoyed it. And so, apparently 
did the other customers. It is a 
clever routine. I'll admit 1 an't 
figure out how you do it.* 

"Remember what Barnum said,** 
Lima replied lightly. 

"At least you do not take yourself too seriously," Bennett observed. 

"On the contrary," Lima countered, "I take myself very seriously. You, however, do not. You 
are paying for my time and the 
customer is always right.*' 

"Tell me," Bennett asked 
abruptly, "have we ever met before?" 

"Not to my knowledge." 

"Have you any objections to 
telling me about yourself during 
our interview? Who are you? 
What is your background?" 



42 




 



"I will be glad to tell you about 

myself, if you think it will be 
interesting," she replied, after a 
barely perceptible pause. "How I 
came by this exceptional ability 
of mine, I have no slightest conception. I only remember that 
when I was young, and still without the intellect to evaluate social 
mores and customs, I was often 
placed in positions of awkwardness by my ability to read minds. 
At an early age, however, through 
the council of my parents, I 
learned to keep this knowledge to 
myself. 

"By the time I reached my 
twentieth birthday, my parents 
were both dead and I was alone 
in the world. I had never learned 
any occupation. I made some attempts to use my mind-reading 
to some advantage to myself, but 
soon found that I encountered 
the opposition of the medical associations as well as the law. As 
a consequence, I turned to show 
business as the one means of 
earning a legitimate livelihood. 
There is not much more to tell." 

"Can you actually read 
minds?" Bennett asked insistently. 

"I can." 

"Then what am I thinking 

now?" 

"You are thinking," Lima said, 
with no semblance of a trance 
or any of the other usual antics 
of professional mystics, "that I 
look exactly like a woman you 



have never seen, but whose image 
you have carried in your mind 
since your childhood." 

For just a moment, the startling accuracy disconcerted Bennett. 

"I have a problem which is 
quite annoying," he pushed on 
almost frantically. "Can you tell 
me what my problem is?" 

"You have been subject to extremely severe headaches, which 
you have been unable to remedy, 
either by sedatives or with the 
help of a neurologist. Am I correct?" 

"More than you could possibly 
know! Look, I came here believing you were a fake. That didn't 
matter — it was the fact that you 
looked like this other woman that 
counted. I'm convinced now. I 
want your help. Can you help me, 
or at least tell me whether the 
neurologist is right about the 
cause of my headaches?" 

"He is wrong." Lima said. "I 
can tell you what causes them, 
but I am afraid that I will have 
to ask for another hundred dollars for that extra service." 

Bennett was momentarily irritated at this evidence that their 
relationship, at least as far as she 
was concerned, was strictly business. But he shrugged off the 
feeling. He drew five twentydollar bills from bis pocketbook 
and placed them on the table before her.

♦1 



"If you remember," Lima said, 
folding the money carefully and 
tucking it into the neck of her 
dress, "five months ago a building which you had contracted to 
build fell, when it was nearly 
completed, and two workmen 
were killed." 

"I remember very well." 

"You found that the collapse 
of the building was caused by 
faulty material which you had 
bought through a subcontractor. 
You are still investigating to determine where to place the blame, 
and are on the point of doing so." 

"Go on," Bennett breathed 
softly. 

"You are quite certain that the 
person responsible is John Tournajfc ostensibly a reputable 
contractor, but actually an unscrupulous scoundrel. You have 
a choice of exposing him, with 
great personal danger to yourself 
— Tournay is a dangerous and 
ruthless man — or remaining silent 
and knowing that you are a 
coward. The difficulty of that 
choice is causing your headaches." 

"You may be right," Bennett 
admitted without hesitation. "I 
haven't had time to think the 
matter through quite that far. 
What would you advise me to 
do?" 

"That is something which cannot be advised. The answer lies 
within yourself. You are either 



a big enough man to do the right 
thing — which you yourself recognize—or you are a small man 
and will take the safer, less honorable course. The decision and 
the integrity lie within yourself." 

BENNETT slumped. "I see 
that. Then there's nothing 
more that you can do for me?" 

"But there is," Lima replied. "I 
can cure your headaches, if you 
wish — for an additional hundred 
dollars." 

"That would be a cheap price.** 
Bennett drew his wallet from his 
pocket. "My cash is rather low. 
Would you accept a personal 
check?" 

"Certainly," Lima said. "But, 
first, let me explain about my 
cure. There is some mental unpleasantness involved which you 
may consider worse than the ailmt nt " 

"I doubt that. I. can't imagine 
anything worse than this agony." 

"Your mind will be placed under my control and led through 
a dream sequence. I will follow 
a logical progression of events, 
using your actual past as background. While you arc under my 
control, your experiences will be 
far from pleasant. I will allow 
your mind to follow its own anticipated course of events, influencing your thoughts only slightly 
— directing them into as unpleasant channels as possible. In 



44 




 



fact, to make the cure certain, 
at least the culmination must be 
quite devastating. Do you agree 
to undergo such rigorous mental 
punishment?" 

"But why do I have to?" Bennett 'asked, astonished and worried. 

"That pattern will act in the 
manner of a counter-irritant. 
Your mind is like a spoiled child, 
rejecting anticipated unpleasantness. Under my influence it is 
subjected to possible alternative 
experiences, which are so much 
worse than the one it originally 
feared that it will gratefully accept the lesser evil." 

"That sounds reasonable" 
Bennett agreed. "When could we 
begin this treatment?" 

"Immediately, if you are willing." 

"I see no reason for waiting." 

"Then, if you are ready," Lima 
told him, "lie on this couch. Keep 
your eyes on mine." She spoke 
slowly, evenly. "Remember that 
you are doing this of your own 
free will, that you trust me. I 
am your friend and would do you 
no harm." 

Her voice droned on as Bennett 
looked into her eyes. They 
merged until they became one 
large, placid pool of restfulness, 
and he found himself drawn into 
them. 

He sank peacefully, quietly — 
completely. 




WHEN the telephone rang, 
Bennett knew it was the district attorney returning his call, 
and that the die was cast. Until 
this ugly business was brought to 
a conclusion, his life would be in 
constant danger. 

"Leroy Bennett speaking," he 
said. "I have had collected some 
information that I think will be 
of very great interest to your 
office.** 

"Information about what?" the 
voice at the other end asked 
briskly. 

"I have proof that John Tournay is responsible for the death 
of two men. in an action involving criminal collusion,** 

"If what you say is true, I 
will be glad to see your evidence,** 
the district attorney said. "Could 
you deliver it in person? There 
may be some questions I would 
like to ask you about it." 

"Certainly," Bennett replied. 
"When would be the most convenient time?" 

"Later in the day. I have a 
case going on. How would fourthirty this afternoon suit you?" 

"That would be fine." 

The rest of the day dragged 
slowly. At four o'clock Bennett 
left his office and took the elevator to the ground floor. Under 
his arm he clutched the briefcase 
which might spell death for him, 

A moment after he left his office building, he knew he had

65 



made a mistake — a fatal one! 

Idly, at first, his mind's eye 
watched the driver of a long gray 
sedan, parked at the curb, start 
up its motor as he approached. 
The car pulled away from the 
curb when he came alongside it. 

Through an open rear window, 
Bennett saw a man with a dark, 
brooding face — with black eyebrows that joined over the bridge 
of the nose — glowering at him. At 
the same instant he saw the blunt 
nose of an automatic resting on 
the lowered glass of the window, 
just below the chin of the frowning man. 

Incredibly, even as he realized 
that he was about to die, Bennett's first thought was not one 
of fear, but rather that this dark 
man was the other person he had 
seen in his hallucinations of the 
city of Thone! 

Then, as one part of his mind 
drew back in terror at what it 
knew was about to happen, another' part wondered at the mystery of Thone and the people in 
it. Where did that hallucination 
fit in this mist of life which was 
about to etid? 

He felt three hard, solid blows 
punch shockingly into his body. 
There was pain, but greater thart 
that was the terror that whipped 
his panicked mind. 

"Lima," Bennett whispered 
with his last stark thought as he 
dropped to his knees. 



He groped for the sidewalk 
with one hand, to steady himself, 
and never reached it. 

"IT'S over now/' Bennett heard 
*■ the mystic say. "Please try 
to relax." 

He found himself fighting with 
awful exertion to raise himself 
from the sidewalk — which had 
turned into a couch. His clothes 
clung to him with a clammy wetness that chilled him. 

He flung his arms out in a 
frantic gesture that knocked a 
lamp from an end-table and sent 
it crashing to the floor. 

Not until then did he feel the 
mystic's firmly gentle hands on 
his shoulders, urging him down, 
and know that he was not actually dying. He lay back for a 
moment, gasping great gulps of 
welcome air into his lungs. 

"I think you will be all right 
now," Lima said. 

"You were right when you said 
the experience would not be 
pleasant," Bennett said, still battling for breath. "I hope the results will be worth it." 

"I believe you will find that 
they are," Lima told him reassuringly. "Also, it can be of assistance to you in still another way. 
The sequence your dream followed-^being a natural, perhaps 
even a probable, aftermath of 
your past decisions and movements — could actually happen. 




 



Therefore it would be wise to 
avoid such decisions in real life.** 

A T the end of two weeks, Bennett had collected all the 
information he needed on Tournay's illegal activities. The investigator he hired was very 
thorough, and unearthed several 
other incriminating schemes in 
Tournay's past. With the'evidence 
he had on hand, Bennett was certain that Tournay would be convicted in any court. 

This time he intended to evade 
the fate he had suffered in the 
dream by acting differently. He 
hired a shrewd lawyer — the best 
obtainable — had him draw up 
the evidence in legal form, and 
presented it to the district attorney, with the demand for 
Tournay's immediate arrest. He 
knew that immediate action 
would be his best protection. 

That evening, when he left his 
office building, he felt the peace 
of a man whose task has been 
well done. 

It took almost a full second before the sight of the long gray 
car jerked his thoughts from their 
pleasant introspection and back 
to dread reality. Tournay's blackbrowed face leered at him as it 
had in the dream and he felt 
his body tense as it waited for 
the pistol slugs to strike. 

His mind scurried in its trap 
within his head and, strangely, 



it turned to the mystic for help. 
"Lima!" he called desperately. 

\ GAIN Bennett felt himself 
**■ struggling with that awful 
exertion to drag his body from 
the couch on which it lay. 

"It's all over now," he heard 
Lima say. 

He sat up. "What happened?** 

"This will be hard to believe,** 
Lima said, "and I will not try to 
prove it to you, but it is true. The 
mind has many powers which 
cannot even be imagined by anyone'who has not lived with those 
powers as I have. When you 
called me, your mind attuned itself with mine, and its need and 
its demand were so powerful that 
together we turned time backward. You are now back in my 
dressing room, and it is the exact 
time at which you originally 
came out of your dream." 

"That's impossible !" Bennett 
protested. 

"Nevertheless, it happened. I 
only ask you to keep in mind one 
thing. Someday, when your mind 
has been made more facile, you 
will understand how I am able 
to do this. It will even appear 
logical to you. Now, however, 
the only thing I can tell you is 
believe it!" 

jDBNNETT had no intention of 
muffing this second chance. 
After he had collected the infor

irtation about Tournay's criminal 
activities, he also dug into his 
past for a man who had cause to 
hate the contractor. He found the 
man he sought, a man as ruthless and unscrupulous as Tournay 
himself, one who could fight him 
on his own ground. 

Roger Clarkson had been the 
controller of a string of bookie 
joints, before he had been framed 
by Tournay, and convicted, to 
serve ten years in prison. 

Clarkson had been released 
from prison six days before. He 
found that Tournay had gained 
control of his former criminal empire. Everyone, including Tournay, knew that the only thing 
preventing Clarkson from taking 
re\ftnge was the opportunity. 

Bennett sent his information to 
Clarkson and sat back to await 
the results. That evening, as he 
was about to leave his office 
building, some inner caution 
warned him to take no chances. 
He stepped cautiously out into 
the street, looked both ways for 
the gray sedan, and saw that the 
street was empty, before he 
walked to the corner. 

He arrived there just in time 
to meet the long gray sedan as it 
drove up. 

ONCE more he fought the awful exertion on the mystic's 
couch. This time he came out of 
the blackness with his mind clear. 



"You've saved me again." he said 
to Lima. "Have you turned time 
backward again?" 

*'Yes," she replied. "But I have 
given you all the help I can. The 
next attempt you make, you will 
have nothing on which to lean 
except your own strength." 

"But why do I always arrive 
at the point where I'm being shot 
by Tournay, regardless of what 
course I choose? Is there no way 
I can beat him?" 

"If you believe in fate as 
strongly as I do, you will accept 
that conclusion as inevitable. The 
long gray sedan is the symbol of 
your death. You cannot avoid it 
— at least not as long as you persist in passive action." 

"What do you mean by that?" 

"Just this. You wish to see 
Tournay punished — your sense of 
justice demands it. But each time 
you try to have someone else administer that punishment. It 
appears to me that the only 
possibility of your breaking this 
fateful progression of events is 
for you to administer the punishment yourself. You probably realize the danger of trying that. 
But I can't see where you have 
any other choice." 

"In other words, you feel that 
the only chance I have of preventing Tournay from killing me 
—is to kill him first?" 

"Yes," Lima said. "Are you 
strong and hard enough to do it?" 



GAtAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Bennett thought for only a 
brief moment before he nodded. 
"I'm desperate enough, at any 
rate," 

This time he did not leave immediately. He had to find out 
something first. He put his arms 
around Lima's shoulders and 
drew her toward him. She put 
her face up and he kissed her 
waiting lips. They were sweet 
and. if she did not return the ardor of his kiss, lie did not notice it. 

"]ly¥R. Tournay is not in," the 
•L" girl at the desk told Bennett. "You might try his home." 

At a pay-booth in the lobby, 
Bennett called Tournay's home. 
The voice that answered was that 
of a tired woman, one who has 
given up hope. "Mr. Tournay 
called me a short time ago and 
said that he would be in the 
office of a Mr. Leroy Bennett, in 
the Lowry building, if anyone 
called," the tired voice said. 

Bennett hung up and caught 
a cab. His tjuarry had walked 
into an ideal place for their meeting. For better or for worse, he 
would soon bring this conflict to 
an end. 

In his office, Bennett found that 
Tournay had been there and gone. 
He had left a message: "Tell 
Mr, Bennett that Lima sent me!" 

So that was it — Lima had used 
Bennett as a dupe! He could not 



figure out her purpose, but he 
knew that he could never trust 
her again. She had been against 
him from the first. Perhaps even 
she, rather than Tournay, was the 
prime menace. He decided that 
he must kill them both, before 
they had the chance to kill him. 
Touching the small flat pistol 
snuggling in its shoulder holster, 
he knew the pursuit must continue immediately. 

He rode the elevator to the 
ground floor, and he felt his mind 
working with a clarity and a 
precision which he had seldom 
experienced before. This time he 
knew he would win. 

Shrewdly, before leaving the 
building, Bennett looked out 
through the glass pane in the 
door first. He waited only a moment before he saw the long 
gray sedan as he had expected. 
They would not trap him again. 
Ducking back, he walked rapidly 
toward a side exit. 

Night had fallen by the time 
he reached the carnival building. 
He did not ring the bell. Instead, he walked to the rear, 
climbed the stairs of a fire-escape, 
and softly opened the window of 
a bedroom. 

He stepped inside just as softly 
and stood listening for breathing. 
He heard none. This was probably too early for Lima to be in 
bed. 

The bedroom door was open. 



WHEELS WITHIN 



Bennett could see a light coming 
from another part of the apartment — probably the living room. 
He paused to steel himself for 
what he must do. The time had 
come when he would have to be 
savagely ruthless. 

He found Lima sitting on a 
couch, reading a book. He suspected that she still had some 
control over his mind and he had 
no intention of letting her influence him. She must be killed before she could read his intention. 

"It didn't work." Bennett spoke 
just loudly enough to startle 
Lima into raising her head. 

As she looked up, he shot her 
squarely between the eyes. 

In an agony of frustration, 
Berwiett saw the flesh of her forehead remain clear and undisturbed. He knew he could not 
miss at this range, yet she was 
unhurt. He lowered his sights and 
shot at the white neck beneath 
the fair head. She still sat there, 
returning his gaze, unperturbed, 
unmarked by the bullets. 

He pumped the four remaining 
bullets into her body. The only 
part of her that moved was her 
lips. * 

"It's no use. Leroy." she said. 
"Haven't you guessed? You are 
still in your dream. You can't 
kill me there." 

Suddenly the implication struck 
him with its awful simplicity. 

"Good God!" His voice rose. 



"Do you mean I've never been 
out of my dream?" He hesitated 
while the thought sank in. "My 
remembrance of coming out of 
it was only part of the dream itself," he murmured. "That was 
why you were able to turn time 
backward at will." 

A cold calmness returned to 
him. 

"Tell me," he said, "am I still 
in the dream?" 

"Yes," Lima replied. 

"Then I demand that you free 
me now!" 

"As you wish," Lima said 
sadly. "And may God help you." 

Bennett wrenched his body 
from the couch on which it lay 
and struggled to his feet. Though 
the dream had seemed real 
enough, he could look back on 
it now and see it as any other 
dream. 

He breathed easier, and then 
stopped abruptly when he heard 
a voice behind him say, "You 
are still a dead man!" 

Be nnett whi rled a nd found 
himself facing Tournay. And 
Tournay held a pistol aimed at 
his heart. 

Bennett turned desperately back 
to Lima. His lips formed her 
name, but the sound died almost 
before it was uttered. This time, 
he saw, she would not help him. 
Her features had hardened and 
no mercy or compassion registered on them.

"There is no escape,** she said. 

A fleeting thought went through 
his mind of springing at Tournay and trying to reach him before the gun could be fired. But 
one glance at Tournay's face 
made him realize how futile — and 
fatal — that would be. 

Tournay's finger tightened on 
the trigger of his gun and Bennett 
thought ahead in despair to what 
was to come. One thing he knew: 
He did not want to die! Was 
there no way out? 

The answer came like a cry of 
re'ief. There was a way — Thone! 
The city of his enigma. Tournay 
an 1 Lima could not harm him 
there. 

FOR just an instant, Bennett's 
vision blurred. Time paused, 
and the next moment he knew 
he had returned to Thone. The 
sounds of the alien city floated 
up to him and he stirred. 

He grasped the sides of his 
coffinlike bed with fingers that 
had lost their sense of touch. He 
pulled himself up to a sitting position and looked about him. On 
one side stood Lima, though now 
her features were not those of 
the implacable, merciless mystic, 
but rather those of a woman in 
love. 

She smiled happily and said, 
**At last you have returned." 

Bennett strove to move his 
tongue and lips to ask questions. 



but they refused, as though 
numbed by long inaction. He 
turned to his other side and gazed 
questioningly at the replica of 
Tournay who stood there. 

Tournay's image spoke. "We 
had quite a time bringing you 
back, Sire. But now it has been 
accomplished — for good." 

Striving to move his throat 
muscles, Bennett finally forced 
a sound, and then words, through 
his lips. 

"Tell me,** he pleaded. "Who 
are you? And, more important, 
who am I?" 

He turned to Lima for an answer, realizing that now she 
would help him if anyone would. 

"Doctor Tournay will explain 
it to you," Lima replied,, indicating the dark man. 

Imploringly, Bennett turned 
back to face Tournay. 

"I see that very little of your 
memory has returned yet," Tournay said. "In a short while, everything — all your past — will 
come back to you. Until then, 
perhaps I had better explain to 
you who you are. My words will 
help trigger your returning memory, and speed up the process." 

"Please" do," Bennett begged. 

"You are Benn Ett, Le Roy of 
the city-state of Thone, in the 
year 4526 A. D. Six months ago, 
the strain of governing the city 
began to undermine your health. 
Acting under my advice, you de

cided to take a somno-rest cure. 

"This rest cure," the doctor 
continued, "is quite standard 
practice in our time. We had a 
little difficulty bringing you out 
of it at the end of six months. 
Evidently your som no -existence 
must have been very pleasant." 

"Do you mean that the existence I remember was merely an 
induced figment of my imagination?" 

"Yes. You see, the best rest 
that can be given a mind is to 
give it not sleep, but pleasant 
work. Therefore, under my manipulation, you were given a 
pseudo-existence in a past era of 
history. You were led to conceive 
yourself as occupying a position, which, after close study, I 
deduced would be the most suitable and relaxing for you." 

"But if that is true, why did 
my dream have to end so unpleasantly — I might say, so 
nearly fatally?" Bennett demanded. 

"The more successful I am in 
choosing a pleasant existence for 
a patient in the somno, the more 
difficult it is to bring him out of 
it," the doctor replied. "Your unconscious mind, realizing how 
happy you were in your simulated existence, and how it would 
have to return to the rigor and 



stress which unnerved it before, 
fought with all its strength to remain where the somno had placed 
it. 

"The usual practice in bringing a patient back to reality is 
for the doctor to enter the dream 
and convince him, by whatever 
means may be necessary, to return. Sometimes, however, the 
patient is so firmly tied to 
his somno -existence that drastic 
measures must be used. This is 
usually done by means of making 
the somno -existence so anxietyproducing that the patient is glad 
to return. 

"Your particular release was 
one of the most difficult that I 
have ever encountered. In fact, I 
was unable to bring you back 
myself, and asked your wife, 
Lima, to enter the somno with me 
and help force you to return." 

Bits of recollection, which had 
been edging into Bennett's memory, burst through in full force, 
and he remembered. It was true. 
He was Benn Ett, he Roy of the 
city-state of Thone. 

He turned to Lima and, as he 
read the glad light in her eyes, 
he knew that she had witnessed 
the return of his complete memory. 

"Welcome home," she said.

when you're near me 



By RICHARD MATHESON 




THE silvery ship came rushing in backward through 
the veils of broken cloud, 
tobogganing down the atmosphere of Station Four. Fires of 
deceleration jetted red from the 
reactor ports, roaring their hurricane thrust against the clutch of 
gravity. 

Air thickened ; the glittering 
rocket speck slid easier, settling 
down like a parachuting missile. 
Sunlight splashed its metal sides 
with light and the blue ocean 
waters billowed wide to swallow 
it. The ship dipped in a wide arc 
and backed down toward the 
reddish -green -clad land. 

Inside its tiny cabin, the three 
men lay strapped and waiting for 
the shock of contact. Their eyes 
were closed, their hands tight and 
blood-drained. 

Muscle blocks struggled against 
the drag. 

The ground swept up. The ship 
settled hard on its rear braces, 
trembling. Then, finally, it stood 
motionless and silent, successfully navigated through scores of 
light years of vacuum night. 

A quarter mile away were the

warehouse, village and house. 

CRITICAL. That was official 
record. Station Four, the 
Three-Moon Psycho Ward. 
David Lindell knew it; all the 
Wentner men knew and wondered. 

Wentner's Interstellar Trading 
Company put a man on other 
stations, for two years at a clip. 
Here on Four it was only for six 
months. Why? Because it was 
critical. Why? Nobody could 
stand the place longer than six 
months. Why? It always came to 
•"why"? 

"But like I always say," Lindell 
said, "ifs no use worrying myself." 

He said it to Martin, the ship's 
co-pilot, as the two of them 
trudged across the wide meadow 
toward the distant compound, 
carrying Lindell's luggage. 

"You have the right Idea,** 
said Martin. "Don't worry yourself." 

"That's what I always say," 
said Lindell. "They're paying me 
enough and they have to take 
care of me if anything happens. 
Its their headache." 

They passed the silent gargantuan warehouse. The sliding 
doors were half open and, inside, 
Lindell could see the concrete 
floor empty and sunlight filtering bright ribbons through the 
skylight. Martin told him the 



cargo ship had emptied it out 
a few weeks before. Lindell grunted and shifted his luggage. 

"Where are the workers?" he 
asked. 

Martin gestured toward the 
native village about three hundred yards away. There was no 
sound from the low-slung white 
dwellings methodically arranged 
to form three sides of a rectangle. 
The windows blinked fiercely in 
the sunlight. 

"Guess they're sacked down," 
Martin judged. "They sleep a lot 
when work is done. You'll see 
them tomorrow when shipments 
start coming in again." 

"Got their families with them?" 
Lindell asked. 

"Nope." 

"Thought it was company policy." 

"Not here. The Gnees don't 
have much family life. Too few 
men and practically all of them 
pretty dumb." 

"Great," Lindell said. "Dandy." 
He shrugged. "Well, it's no use 
worrying myself about it." 

While they were on the stairs 
to the hallway of the house, he 
asked Martin where Corrigan 
was. 

"He went home with the cargo 
ship," Martin said. "The company allows that once in a while. 
There's nothing to do here anyway after the goods are picked 
up."

"Oh," said Linden. "What's 
this door?" He kicked it open and 
looked in at the combination 
living room-library. 

"All the comforts of," he said. 

"More," said Martin, looking 
over Lindell 's shoulder. "Over 
there you have a movie projector 
and a tape recorder." 

"Swell," Lindell said. "I can 
talk to myself legal." Then he 
grimaced. "Let's dump these 
bags. My arms are falling off." 

They shuffled down the hall 
and Lindell glanced into the 
small "kitchen as they passed. It 
was porcelain-paneled and well 
kept. 

"Can this Gnee woman cook?" 
he asked. 

"From what I hear," said Martin, "you'll be packing it in like 
a king." 

"Glad to hear it. Incidentally, 
you got any idea why they call 
this joint the Three-Moon Psycho 
Ward?" 

"Who calls it?" 

"The boys back on Earth." 

"The boys are all wet You'll 
like it here." 

"But wliy is it only a six month 
stint?" 

"I don't know — maybe the 
company doesn't want its help to 
stay here for good," said Martin. 
"Here's your bedroom." 

A S they entered, the Gnee 
**• woman was making the bed, 



her back to the door. Thi 
thumped down the bags and sli 
turned slowly, un alarmed o 
startled. Lindell's hands twitched 
Oh, well, he thought, I've seen 
worse in my day. 

She wore a heavy robe fastened 
at the neck and falling to the 
floor like a truncated cone of 
cloth. All he could see was her 
head. 

It was a squat coarsely grained 
head, pink and hairless — like the 
mottled belly of an expecting 
chihuahua, he decided. For ears, 
there were cavities on the sides 
of her flat chinless face. Her nose 
was a stub, single -nostriled. Hei 
lips were thick and monkeylike 
outlining a small circle of mouth 

Hello, Lover, Lindell decided 
not to say. 

She came across the room 
quietly and he blinked at her 
eyes. Then she placed a moist, 
spongy hand in his. 

"Hya," he said. 

"She can't hear," Martin said. 
"Telepathic." 

"That's right, I forgot." 

Hello, he thought, and Hello 
came back the answering welcome. It is good to have you. 

"Thanks," he said. She seems 
Wife a decent kid, he thought to 
himself; weird but homy. A question touched his brain like 
timid hand. 

"Yeah, sure," he said. Yes, he 
added in his mind.

"What's that?" Martin asked. 

"She asked if she should unpack. I think." Lindell slumped 
down on the bed. "Ah," he said, 
"this I like." He pushed exploring 
fingers into the mattress. 

"Say, how do you know it's a 
she?" he asked when he and Martin were walking back down the 
bill while the Gnee woman unpacked. 

"The robe. The males don't 
wear robes." 
"That's all?" 

Martin looked away. "A few 
other things of absolutely no interest to you." 

They moved into the living 
room and Lindell tried out the 
easy chair for size. He leaned 
ba^k and stroked the arms with 
satisfied fingers. 

"Critical of not," he said, "this 
station has 'em all beat for comfort." 

He sat there, momentarily remembering the woman's eyes, 
f hty had seemed huge, covering 
a full third of her face, like 
big glass saucers with dark cup 
rings for pupils. And they were 
moist; bowls of liquid. He 
shrugged and let it go. So what, 
he thought, it's nothing. 

"Hah? What?" he asked, hearing Martin's voice. 

*I said be careful." Martin was 
holding up a shiny gas pistol. 
"This is loaded," he warned. 

"Who needs it?" 

71 



"You won't. Just standard 
equipment." Martin dropped it 
back in the desk drawer and 
shoved the drawer back in. "And 
you know where all your books 
are," he said. "The warehouse 
office is set up like all the other 
station offices." 

Lindell nodded. "I won't get 
lost." 

Martin glanced at his watch. 
"Well, I have to be going. Let's 
see," he continued, as he and 
Lindell started for the door, "anything else to tell you? You know 
the rule about not harming the 
people, of course." 

"Who's, gonna harm them? 
Whoops!" 

They'd almost knocked her 
over as they exited from the 
room. She jumped back one more 
bouncy step and stared at them, 
eyes wide and frightened. 

"Take it easy, kiddo," Lindell 
soothed. "What's up?" 

Eat? The thought cringed before 
him like a beggar at the back 
door of his mind. 

He pursed his lips and nodded. 
"You took the words right out of 
my head.*' 

He looked at her and concentrated. /'// be back as soon as I 
walk the co-pilot to his ship. 
Make something good. 

She nodded violently and rushed toward the kitchen. ' 

"Where's she off to like a bat? M 
Martin asked curiously, as they 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



turned for the stairs. 

"She's going to rustle me a 
snack," Lindell chuckled as they 
descended. "That's what I call 
service de luxe. This telepathy 
is okay, you know? At other 
stations it was either learn half 
the language to get a ham sandwich or try and teach 'em English so I wouldn't starve. Either 
way I really had to sweat for my 
supper until things got settled." 

He looked pleased. 

"This is real hot," he said. 

Their heavy boots crushed 
down the tall crisp blue grass as 
they approached the upright ship. 

Martin held out his hand. 
"Take it easy, Lindell. See you in 
six months." 

"Right enough. Give old man 
Wentner a kick in the pants for 
me." 

"Will do." 

He watched the co-pilot dwindle in size, ascending the metal 
ladder to the hatchway. A midget Martin pulled himself into the 
ship and clanged the metal port 
shut. Lindell waved back at the 
tiny figure at the port and then 
turned and walked away to escape the blast. 

He stood on a hill underneath 
the heavy scarlet foliage of a tree. 
Inside the ship's belly there was 
a liquid cough, a rush -of exploding gases. He watched the ship 
hang for a moment on its flaming 
exhaust and then flash up into the 



green-blue sky, leaving scorched 
ground in its wake. The next instant it was gone. 

He walked in lazy strides back 
toward the house, gazing appreciatively at the profusion of 
livid plants and flowers in the 
meadow around him, bulbous insects hanging over them. 

He took off his jacket and let it 
hang from one hand as he walked. 
The sun felt good on his lean 
back. 

"Boys," he said to the fragrant 
air, "you're all wet." 

*T1HE great blazing sun was almost gone, spraying the sky 
red with the blood of its cyclic 
dying. Soon the three moons 
would rise — guaranteed to drive 
insane a man looking for a shadow he could call his own. 

Lindell sat at the living room 
window, gazing out over the 
countryside. You couldnt beat it, 
he thought; for air or climate or 
all the things that grew in Earthpaling technicolor. Nature outdid 
herself in this tucked-away corner of the Galaxy. 

He sighed and stretched, wondering about supper. 

Drink? 

He started, chopping a yawn in 
half, and drew his fingers together so fast that the knuckle bones 
crackled. 

He saw her standing at his 
side offering a tray with a glass 



IOVER WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 



on it. He reached for it, feeling 
his heart placate itself after the 
initial jolt. 

"I'd knock or something," he 
•uggested. 

The big eyes were elliptical 
now. They stared at him without 
comprehension. 

"Well, let it go," he said, after 
a sip of the warm, tangy liquid. 
He smacked his lips and took 
another sip, a long one. 

"Damn good," he said. 
"Thanks, Lover." 

He blinked at himself. That 
brings a guy up short, he decided. 
Lover? Of all the unlikely names 
in the Universe. . . . 

He glanced at her with a 
chuckle bubbling up in his throat. 
> She hadn't moved. Her face 
was screwed up into what he assumed was a smile. But her 
mouth wasn't designed for smiling. 

"Hey, when are we eating?" he 
asked, feeling an edge uncomfortable under the unmoving gaze of 
her watery eye globes. 

She turned and hurried to the 
door. 

There she turned. 

All ready already, he got the 
the message. 

He grinned, downed the drink, 
got up and followed her eager 
shuffle down the dim hallway. 

Some time later he pushed 
eway the plate with a sigh and 
leaned back in the chair. 



"That's what I call good," he 
said. 

Like a hidden spring, he felt 
her pleasure well up in his mind. 
Lover thanks you. 

She certainly picked up the 
name fast, he thought. 

She looked at him, eyes wide. 

Was she. trying to smile again? 
he wondered. To him the expression looked like all her others 
■ — the facial poses of an idiot. 
He thought she was smiling, 
though, because of the thoughts 
that accompanied the expression. 

Then he found his eyes involuntarily watering in empathy and 
he turned his head, blinking. A 
trifle nervously, he dumped a teaspoon of sugar in his coffee and 
stirred. He could still feel her 
gaze on him. A twinge of displeasure marred his thoughts and 
she turned away abruptly. That's 
better, he thought, and felt all 
right again. 

"Hey, tell me, Lover," he started to say. Well, might as well 
get used to it, he figured. 

You have a husband? 

Her returned thoughts were 
confused. 

A mate? he re-worded. 

Oh, yes. 

In the worker's village? 

They have no mates, she said, 
and he thought he sensed a note 
of hauteur in her reply. 

He shrugged and took a sip of 
coffee. "Well," he said, "one sat

isfied worker would drive the rest 
of 'em crazy anyway. They'd be 
biting their nails if they have 
nails. And on that note — good 
night." 

In bed he sat writing in his 
much-used diary. Between its 
battered covers were inscribed the 
sparse comments he had made on 
half a dozen different planets. 
This was his seventh station. 

"My lucky number," he paragraphed in blue ink. 

Again no sound. To sleep? His 
pen skiddled and spat out three 
fat blots. He looked up and saw 
her with the tray again. 

"Yeah," he said. Yeah. Thanks, 
Lover. But, look, will you just 
let me know when you. . . . He 
stopped, seeing that it was hopeless. 

"This will make me sleep?" he 
asked. 

Oh, yes, was the reply. 

He took a sip, looking down at 
the ink-blotted page. Just started 
it anyway, he thought; no loss or 
priceless literature. He ripped out 
the page and crumpled it in one 
hand. 

"This is good stuff," he said, 
nodding his head toward the glass. 
He held up the paper. 

Throw it away, hah? Throw 
away? she asked. 

"That's right," he said. "Now 
clear out. What in hell are you 
doing in a man's boudoir anyway?" 



She scuttled across the floor 
and he grinned as she closed the 
door quietly behind herself. 

Finishing the drink, he set it 
down on the bedside table and 
turned off the lamp. He settled 
back on the soft pillow with a 
sigh. Critical, he thought in drowsy satisfaction. Nuts. 

Good night. 

He opened his heavy-lidded 
eyes and looked around. There 
was no one in the room. He sank 
back. 

Good night. 

He raised up on one elbow, 
squinting into the darkness. 
Good night. 

"Oh," he said. "Good night, 
yourself." The thoughts abated. 
He fell back again and made his 
mouth a tooth-edged cave with 
yawning. 

"How about that?" he muttered thickly, turning on his side. 
"Absolutely no mirrors. See? 
Nothin* up my sleeves. Howboutha. . . ." 

He had a dream. The dream 
covered him with sweat. 

A FTER breakfast, he left the 
house with ber farewells tugging at his brain, and headed 
across the grounds for the warehouse. Already, he saw, the Gnee 
men were formed in a moving 
line, carrying bundles on their 
heads. They marched into the 
warehouse, deposited their bur

den on the concrete and had it 
checked off by a Gnee foreman 
who stood in the center of the 
floor, holding a clipboard thick 
with paper-thin vouchers. 

As Lindcll approached, the 
men all bowed and looked more 
cowed as they hastened on their 
rounds. He noticed that their 
heads were flatter than Lover's, 
a little more darkly tinted, and 
with smaller eyes. Their bodies 
were broad and thick-muscled. 

They do look stupid, he 
thought. 

As he came up to the man who 
was doing the checking and sent 
out an unanswered thought, he 
gaw that they weren't telepathic 
either. Or maybe didn't want to 
be. 

% "How doody," said the man in 
a squeaky voice. "I check. You 
check?" 

"That's okay," Lindell said, 
pushing back the clipboard. "Just 
bring it into the office when the 
first batch is all in." 

"What, hah?'' said the man. 

Jeez, are you a case, Lindell 
thought: "Bring this," he said, 
tapping the clipped sheaf of papers, "Bring to office." He pointed 
again. "Bring to me . . . me! When 
goods are all in." 

The man's splotchy face lit up 
with a look of eager stupidity and 
he nodded brightly. Lindell patted his shoulder. Good boy. rasped his mind. I bet you're dyna


mite in a crisis. 

He headed for the office, gritting his teeth. 

Inside, he shut the plastiglass 
door behind him and looked 
around the office. It was all the 
same as he remembered from 
other stations, except for the cot 
in one corner. 

Don't tell me / have to sleep 
out here nights, he thought with 
a groan. 

He moved closer. On the flat 
soil-cased pillow was the imprint 
of a head. He picked up a light 
brown hair. And what in the hell 
is this? he wondered. Under the 
cot he found a belt without a 
buckle. On the wall by the cot 
there were violent scratches, as 
though a man in fever had tried 
to get out of the office the hard 
way. He stared at them. 

The joint is haunted, he concluded with a vague shake of his 
head. Then he turned away with 
a shrug. No use worrying myself, 
he thought. / got six months to 
go and nothing's going to get me 
down. 

He sat down quickly before the 
desk and dragged the heavy station log before himself. He flipped 
open, the heavy cover and started 
reading from the beginning. 

The first entries were twenty 
years dry. They were signed Jefferson Winters or. a little later, 
a hasty Jeff. At the end of six 
months and fifty -two closely 



82 




 



packed pages, Lindell found page 
53 covered with a floridly penned 
message, "Station Four, good -byforever!" Jeff didn't seem to have 
had any difficulties adjusting to 
the life there. 

Lindell shifted back in the 
creaking chair and pulled the 
heavy book on his lap with a sigh 
of boredom. 

It was after the first replacement's second month that the 
entries started to get ragged . 
There were blurred words, hurried scrawling, mistakes deleted 
and re-done. Some of the errors 
apparently had been corrected 
much later by still another replacement. 

It was that way through the 
next four hundred or so sleepinducing pages; a sorry chain of 
flaws and eventual correction. 
Lindell flipped through them 
wearily without the slightest interest in their content. 

Then he reached the entries 
signed Bill Cprrigan and, with a 
blinking yawn, he straightened 
himself up, propped the book on 
the desk and paid closer attention. 

They were the same as in every 
case before, excluding the first 
one — efficient beginnings declining markedly to. increased wildness, the penmanship erring more 
extravagantly with each month 
until, at last, it became almost 
illegible. He found a few blat


antly miscalculated additions 
which he corrected in his careful 
hand. 

Corrigan's writing, he noted, 
, broke off in the middle of a word 
one afternoon. And for the last 
month and a half of Corrigan's 
stay, there were nothing but 
blank pages. He thumbed through 
them carelessly, shaking his head 
slowly* 

Have to admit it, he thought. 
I don't get it. 

OITTING in the living room 
^ through twilight and, later, 
at supper, he began to get the 
sensation that Lover's thoughts 
were somehow alive, like microscopic insects crawling in and out 
among the fissures of his brain. 
Sometimes they barely moved ; 
other times they leaped excitedly. 
Once, when he became a little irritated with her staring, the 
thoughts were like invisible suppliants pawing weepily at his 
mind. 

What was worse, he realized 
while reading in bed, the sensation occurred even when she 
wasn't in the same room with 
him. It was disconcerting enough 
to feel an endless stream of 
thoughts flowing into him while 
she was close; this remote control business was just a little too 
much for his taste. 

Hey, how about U? he tried to 
reason her away good-naturedly. 



LOVES WHEN YOU'RE NEAt ME 



But all he got back was the picture of her looking at him wideeyed and uncomprehending. 

"Ah, nuts," he muttered and 
tossed his book on the bedside 
table. Maybe thafs it, he thought, 
settling down for the night; this 
telepathy gimick. Maybe that 
vas what got the other men. Well, 
tot me, he vowed. / just won't 
sorry myself about it. And he 
-urned out the lamp, said good 
light to the air and went to 
■sleep. 

"Sleep," he muttered, unaware, 
only partly conscious. It wasn't 
sleep. Not deep enough by half. 
A cloudy ha2e submerged his 
mind and filled it with the same 
detailed scene. It telescoped and 
sank away in a burst. It magnified, welling up and swallowing 
him and everything. 

Lover. Lover. The echo of a 
shriek in a long black corridor. 
The robe fluttering close by. He 
saw her pale features. "No," he 
said, "stay away. Far, close, beyond, upon." He cried out. "No. 
No. NO!" 

He jolted up in the darkness 
with a choking grunt, eyes full 
open. He stared groggily around 
the empty bedroom, his thoughts 
broiling. 

He reached out in the darkness 
and flicked on the lamp. Hurriedly, he stuck a cigarette between his lips and lay slumped 
against the headboard, blowing 



out clouds of curling smoke. He 
raised his hand and saw that it 
shook. He muttered words without sense. 

Then his nostrils twitched and 
his lips drew back in revulsion. 
What the hell died? he thought. 
There was a heavy saccharine 
odor in the air, getting worse 
every second. He tossed off the 
covers. 

At the foot of the bed he 
found them — a thick pile of livid 
purple flowers arranged as an 
offering. 

He looked at them a moment 
and then bent over to pick them 
up and throw them away. He 
drew back, gasping, as a thorn 
punctured his right thumb. 

He pressed out bright blood 
drops and sucked the wound, his 
brain assailed by the thickening 
smell of the ugly blooms. 

TT'S very nice of you, he sent 
her the message, but no more 
Sowers. 

She looked at him. She doesn't 
get it, he knew. 

"Do you understand?" he 
asked. 

Floods of affection gurgled over 
the layers of his brain like syrup. 
He stirred his coffee restlessly 
and the transfer eased as though 
she were determined not to offend 
him. The kitchen was silent except for the clink of his silver on 
the breakfast dishes and the slight 



84 




 



whispering rustle of her robe. 

He gulped down coffee and 
stood up to leave. 

I'll eat lunch around . . . 

I know. Her thought cut into 
his, mildly commanding. He 
grinned a little to himself as he 
headed down the hall. Her telepathed message had come with 
an almost motherlike chiding. 

Then, crossing the grounds, he 
recalled the dream again and the 
departing grin emptied his features of amusement. 

All morning he wondered irritably what made the Gnee men 
so stupid. If they dropped a bundle, it was a project to pick it up 
again. They're like brainless 
cows, he thought, watching them 
through the office windows as 
they plodded through their tasks, 
eyes dull and unblinking, their 
thick shoulder!; sloping inward. 

He knew definitely now that 
they weren't telepathic. He'd tried 
several times to give them orders 
with his mind alone and there 
was no receipt of message. They 
reacted only to loudly repeated 
words of two syllables or, preferably, less. And they reacted 
moronically at that. 

In the middle of the morning 
he looked up from the backlog 
of paper work that Corrigan had 
left and realized, with some 
shock, that her thoughts were 
reaching him all the way from 
the house. 




And yet they weren't thoughts 
he could translate into words. 
They were just sensations, amorphously present. He got the feeling that she was checking, sending out exploratory beams now 
and again to see if all was well 
with him. 

The first few times it did no 
more than amuse him; he 
chuckled softly and went back to 
his work. 

But then the proddings assumed an annoyingly regular 
time pattern and he began to 
squirm in his chair. He found 
himself becoming rigidly erect 
and anticipating them seconds before they came. 

By late morning he was repulsing them consciously, tossing his 
pen on the desk and ordering her 
angrily to leave him alone when 
he worked. Her thoughts would 
break off contritely — and soon 
come back again, like creeping 
things that stole upon him, insinuating and beyond insult. 

His nerves began to fray a 
little. He left the office and 
prowled the warehouse floor, tearing open bundles and checking 
goods with impatient fingers. The 
thoughts followed him around 
faithfully
"How doody," said the Gnee 
foreman every time Lindell 
passed, making him angrier yet. 

Once he straightened up suddenly over a bundle artd said 



HOVER WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 



as 



loudly, "Go -away J" 

The -foreman jumped a foot in 
the sir. His pencil and clipboard 
went flying, and he hid behind a 
pillar and looked fearfully at 
Lindell. 

Lindell pretended not to notice. 

LATER, back in the office, he 
sat thinking, the _open log 
book before him. 

No wonder the Gnee men didn't 
telepath, he thought. They knew 
what was good for them. 

Then he looked out the window 
at the plodding line of workers. 

What if they weren't just ' 
avoiding telepathy? What if they 
were incapable of it; had once 
held the ability and, because of 
it, had been broken to their present state of witless stolidity? 

He thought of what Martin had 
said about the women outnumbering the men. And a phrase entered his brain — matriarchy by 
mind. The phrase offended him, 
but he was suddenly afraid that 
it might be true. It would explain 
why the other men had cracked. 
For if the women were in control, it might well be that, in their 
inherent lust for dominance, they 
made no distinction between their 
own men and the men from 
Earth. A man is a man is a man. 
He twisted angrily at the idea of 
possibly being considered on a 
level with the dolts who lived in 
the village. 



He stood up abruptly. I'm not 
hungry, he thought, nor at all. 
But I'm going back to the house 
and order her to make me lunch 
and let her know I'm not hungry 
either. I'll make her used to being dominated herself and then 
she'll get no chance to pick at 
me. No bug-eyed female Gnee, 
by God, is going to get me down.' 

Then he blinked and turned 
away quickly when he realized 
that he was staring at the wild 
pattern of scratches on the far 
office wall, and the belt without 
a buckle that still curled limply 
underneath the cot. 

^T^HE dream again. It tore at 
his brain tissues with claws 
of razor. Sweat covering him, he 
tossed on the bed with a groan 
and was suddenly awake, staring into the darkness. 

He thought he saw something 
at the foot of the bed. He closed 
his eyes and shook his head and 
looked again. The room was 
empty. He felt mind-drenching 
thoughts recede like some alien 
fog. 

His fists contracted angrily. 
She's been at me while I slept, 
he thought. Goddam her hide, 
she's been at me. 

He pushed back the covers and 
crawled to the foot of the bed 
nervously. 

He couldn't see them, but the 
cloying fumes undulated up from 



»6 




 



the floor like erected serpents 
Slithering into his nostrils. Gagging, he slumped down on the 
mattress, his stomach wrenched. 

Why? His brain mumbled over 
and over. My Cod, why? 

Angrily, he threw the flowers 
away in her sight and the 
thoughts pleaded and showered 
over him like raindrops. 

"I said no, didn't I?" he yelled 
at her. 

Then he sat down at the table 
and controlled himself as well as 
he could. I've got a long way to 
go, he told his will. Ease off, ease 
off. 

Now he was sure he knew why 
it was only six months ; that 
would be more than enough. But 
I won't crack, he commanded 
himself, It's a cinch she isn't going to crack, so conserve yourself. She's too stupid to crack, he 
thought deliberately, hoping she'd 
pick it up. 

She apparently did, for her 
shoulders slumped dejectedly all 
at once. And, during breakfast, 
she circled him like a timorous 
wraith, keeping her face averted 
and her thoughts aloof. He found 
himself almost sorry for her then. 
It probably wasn't her fault. It 
was just an inborn trait among 
the Gnee women. 

Then he realized that her 
thoughts were at him again, tender and gratefully maudlin. He 
tried to neutralize himself and ig


nore them as they sought to break 
through his apathy like honeyed 
picks. 

All day he worked hard and 
made payments in spices and 
grain to the Gncc foreman. He 
wondered if the payments would 
go eventually to the women — 
wherever they were. 

"I'm taping my voice," he dictated later that night. "I want 
to hear myself talking so I can 
forget her. There's no one else 
here to talk to: I have to talk to 
myself. A sad case. Well, here 
goes. 

"Here I am on Station Four, 
folks, having a wonderful time 
and wish you were here instead 
of me. Oh. it's not that bad. 
Don't get me wrong. But I guess 
I know what knocked out Corrigan and the poor bastards before 
him. It was Lover and her cannibal mind eating them up. But 
I'll tell you ^this, cousins: it's 
not going to eat me up. That 
much you can put bets on. Lover 
isn't going to . . . 

"No, I didn't call you! Come 
on, get out of my life, will you? 
Go to a movie or something. 
Yeah, yeah, I know. Well, go 
to bed then. Just leave me alone. 

Alone. 

"There. That for her. She'll 
have to go some to get me clawing at the wallpaper." 

But he carefully locked the 
door to his room when he went 



LOVER WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 



87 



to bed. And he groaned in his 
sleep because of the same nightmare and his limbs thrashed and 
alt peace and rest were crowded 
out. 

He twisted into wakefulness in 
mid -morning and stumbled up 
to check the door. He fumbled at 
the lock with heavy fingers. 
Finally his thickened centers divined the fact that the door was 
still locked and he went back to 
bed in a weaving line and fell on 
it into a stupored sleep. 

When he woke up in the morning, there were flowers at the foot 
of his bed, luxuriantly purple and 
foul-smelling. 

The door was still locked. 

TTE couldn't ask her about it 
because he left the kitchen 
in revulsion when she called him 
dear. 

No more flowers. I promise, 
cried her pursuing thoughts. He 
locked himself in the living room 
and sat at the desk, feeling sick. 
Get hold of yourself.' he ordered 
his system, clasping his hands 
tightly and holding his teeth 
firmly clenched. 

Eat? She was outside the door; 
he knew it. 

He closed his eyes. Go away, 
leave me alone, he told her. 

Vm sorry, dear, she said. 

"Stop calling me dear!" he 
shouted, slamming his fist on the 
desk surface. As he twisted in the 



chair, his belt buckle caught on 
the drawer handle and it jerked 
out. He found himself staring 
down at the shiny gas pistol. Almost unconsciously he reached 
down and touched its slick barrel. 

He shoved in the drawer with 
a convulsive movement. None of 
that! 

He looked around suddenly, 
feeling alone and free. He got up 
and hurried to the window. Down 
below, he saw her hurrying across 
the grounds with a basket on her 
arm. She's going for vegetables, 
he thought. But what made her 
leave so suddenly? 

Of course. The pistol. She must 
have gotten his thoughts of violent intent. 

He sighed and calmed down a 
little. I've still got cards in my 
hand, he soothed himself. 

While she was out, he decided 
to look in her room and see if 
he could find the shifting panel 
that enabled her to enter his room 
with the flowers. He hurried down 
the hall and pushed open the door 
to her barely furnished little 
chamber. 

His brain was immediately attacked by the odor of a reeking 
pile of the purple flowers in one 
corner. He held a hand over his 
mouth and nose as he looked 
down in distaste at the living and 
dead blossoms. 

What did they represent? An 
offering of though tfulness? His 




 



throat contracted. Or was it more 
than thought fulness? He grimaced at the thought and remembered that first evening when he'd 
dubbed her Lover. What had possessed him to choose that name 
from the infinity of possible 
names? He hoped he didn't know. 
He hoped he'd never know. 

On her couch he found a small 
pile of odds and ends. There 
was a button, a pair of broken 
shoe laces, the piece of crumpled 
paper he had told her to throw 
away. And a belt buckle with the 
initials W. C. stamped on it. 

There were no secret panels. 

He sat in the kitchen staring 
into an untouched cup of coffee. 
No way she could get in his 
room. W. C. — William Corrigan. 
He had to fight it, keep fighting it. 

Time passed. Suddenly he realized that she was back in the 
house again. There was no sound; 
it was like the return of a ghost. 
But he knew it. A cloud of feeling preceded her, came plunging 
through the rooms like an excited puppy searching. Thoughts 
swirled. 

You are well? You are not 
angry? Lover is back — all hastily 
and eagerly clutching at him. 

She swept into the room so 
quickly that his hands twitched 
and he upset the cup. The hot 
liquid splashed over his shirt and 
trousers as he jumped back. 



knocking over the chair. 

She put down the basket and 
got a towel. He stood there, lips 
drained of color as she patted 
the stains dry. She'd never been 
so close to him. She'd never actually touched him before except 
for that first revolting handshake. 

There was an aroma about her; 
it made his chest heave painfully. 
And all the time, her thoughts 
caressed his mind as her hands 
seemed to be caressing his body. 

There, there. I am here with 
you, David dear. 

Almost in horror, he stared at 
her spongy pink skin, her huge 
eyes, her tiny wound of a mouth. 

And, in the office that morning, 
he made three straight mistakes 
in the log book and tore out the 
whole page and hurled it across 
the room with a choking cry of 
rage. 

A VOID her. No point in arguing or threatening. He tried 
to raze his mental ground so that 
her thoughts could not find domicile there. If he relaxed his 
mind enough, her thoughts flowed 
through and out, perhaps taking 
part of his will as they left, but 
he had to risk that. 

And if he worked hard and 
crowded his head with stodgy 
banks of figures, it kept her at a 
distance and his hands did not 
tremble so badly. 

Maybe I should sleep in the 



LOVER WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 



89 



office, he thought. 

Then he found Corrigan's note. 
It was on a slip of paper stuck 
away in the log book, hidden 
white on white. He only found it 
because he was going through the 
pages one at a time, reciting the 
dates in a loud voice to keep his 
mind filled. 

"God help me," read the note, 
black and jagged-lettered. "Lover 
comes through the walls!" 

Lindell stared. 

"I saw it myself," attested the 
words. "I'm going out of my 
mind. Always that damn animal 
mind tugging and tearing at me. 
And now I can't even shut away 
her body. I slept out here, but 
she came anyway." 

Lindell read it again and it was 
a wind fanning the fires of terror. 
Through the walls. The words 
agonized him. Was it possible? 

It was Corrigan, then, who had 
named her Lover. From the very 
start, the relationship had been 
on her terms. Lindell had had 
nothing to say about it. 

"Lover," he muttered, and her 
thoughts enveloped him suddenly 
like a bat's wings swooping down 
from the sky. He flung up his 
arms and cried out, "Leave me 
alone!" 

And, as her phantom mind 
slipped off, he had the sense that 
it was with less timidity, with 
the patience such as a man knowing his own great strength can 



afford to display. , 

He sank back on the chair, exhausted suddenly, depleted with 
fighting it. He crumpled the note 
in his right hand, thinking of 
the scratches on the wall behind 
him. And he saw in his mind Corrigan tossing on the cot, burning 
with fever, rearing up with a 
shriek of horror to see her standing before him. 

But then? The scene was dark. 

He rubbed a shaking hand over 
his face. Don't crack, he said to 
himself. But it was more a frightened entreaty than a command. 
Wasting fogs of premonition 
flooded over him in chilling 
waves. 

She comes through the walls. 

That night again, he poured 
down the bathroom sink the potion she had made. He locked the 
door and, in the lightless room, 
he squatted in one corner, peering 
and waiting, lungs bellowing only 
because he forced himself to remember to breathe. 

The thermostat lowered the 
heat. The floorboards got icy and 
his teeth started chattering. I'm 
not going to bed, he vowed 
angrily. "He didn't know why it 
was suddenly the bed that 
frightened him. / don't know, he 
forced the words through his 
brain, because he felt vaguely, 
that he did know and he didn't 
want to admit it, even for a 
second. 




 



But, after hours of futile waiting, he had to straighten up with 
a snapping of joints and stumble 
back to bed. There he crawled 
Under the blankets and lay trembling, trying to stay awake. 

She'll come while I'm asleep, 
he thought. 

I mustn't sleep. 

When he woke up in the morning, there were flowers on the 
floor for him. And that was another day before a mass of days 
that sank crushed into the lump 
of months. 

YOU can get used to horror, 
he thought, when it has lost 
immediacy and is no longer pungent and has become a steady 
diet. When it has degraded to a 
chain of mind-numbing events. 
When shocks are like scalpels 
picking and jabbing at delicate 
ganglia until they have lost all 
feeling. 

Yet, though it was no longer 
terror, it was worse. For his 
nerves were raw and bleeding a 
hemophilia of rage. He fought his 
battles to the dregs of seconds, 
gaunt-willed, shouting her off, 
firing lances of hate from his 
despairing mind, tortured by her 
surrenders that were her victories. 
She always came back; like an 
enraging cat, rubbing endless 
sycophantic sides against him, 
filling him with thoughts of . . . 
yes, admit it! he screamed 



to himself through midnight 
struggles. 

Thoughts of love. 

And there was the undercurrent, the promise of new shock 
that would topple his already 
shaking edifice. It needed only 
that; an added push, another stab 
of the blade, one more drop of 
the shattering hammer. 

The shapeless threat hung over 
him. He waited for it, poised for 
it a hundred times an hour, especially at night. Wait. Waiting. 
And sometimes, when he thought 
he knew what it was he was waiting for, the shock of admission 
made him shudder and made him 
want to claw at walls and break 
things and run until the blackness 
swallowed him. 

If he could only forget her 
for a while, just a little while, 
it would be all right. He mumbled 
it to himself as he set up the 
movie projector. 

She begged from the kitchen, 
Can I see? 

"No!" 

Now all his replies, worded or 
thought, were like the snapping 
retorts of a jangled old man. If 
only the six months would end. 
That was the problem. The 
months were not moving fast 
enough. And time was like her — 
not to be reasoned with or intimidated. 

There were many reels of film 
on the wall shelf, but his hand 



10VER WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 



reached up without hesitation 
and picked out one. He didn't 
notice it; his mind was calloused 
to suggestion. He adjusted the 
reel on the spindle and turned out 
the lights. He sat down with a 
tired groan as the flickering milky 
light cone shot out from the lens, 
throwing pictures on the screen. 

A lean dark-bearded man was 
posing, arms crossed, white 
teeth showing in an artificial 
smile. He came closer to the 
camera. The sun flashed, blurring 
the film a second. Black screen. 
Title: "Picture of Me." 

The man, high-cheekboned. 
bright-eyed, stood laughing 
soundlessly out from the screen. 
He pointed to his side and the 
caviera swung around. Lindell 
sat up sharply. 

It was the station. 

Apparently it was fall, for, as 
the camera swept past the house, 
the village, jerking a moment as 
though changing hands, he saw 
the trees surrounded by heaps of 
dead leaves. He sat there shivering, waiting for something, he 
didn't know what. 

The screen blacked. Another 
title roughly etched in white. 
"Jeff in the Office." 

The man peered at the camera, 
an idiotic smile on his face. 
White skin accentuated by the 
immaculate black outline of his 
beard. 

Fadeout, in. The man doing a 



jig around the empty warehouse 
floor, hands poised delicately in 
the air, his dark hair bouncing 
wildly on his skull. 

Another title flashing on the 
screen. Lindell stiffened in his 
seat, his breath cut off abruptly. 

"Lover." 

rriHERE was her face, horribly 
# repellent in black and white. 
She was standing by his bedroom 
window, her face a mask of delight. He could tell it was delight now. Once he would have 
said she looked like a maniac, 
her mouth twisted like a living 
scar, her grotesque eyes staring. 

She spun and her robe swirled 
out. He saw her puffy ankles and 
his stomach muscles grew rock 
taut. 

She approached the camera. 
He saw filmy eyelids slide down 
over her eyes. His hands began 
to tremble violently. It was his 
dream. It made him sick. It was 
his dream to the detail. Then it 
had never been a dream; not from 
his own mind. 

A sob tore at his throat. She 
was undoing the robe. Here it is! 
gibbered his mind in a panic. 
He whimpered and reached out 
shakily to turn off the projector. 

No! It was a cold command in 
the darkness. Watch me, she ordered. 

He sat bound in a vise of terror, staring in sick fascination as 



92 




 



the robe slid from her neck, pulled 
down over her round shoulders. 
She twisted sensuously. The robe 
sank into a heavy swirling heap 
on the floor. 

He screamed, flung out an arm 
that swept into the burning projector. It crashed down on the 
floor. The room was night. He 
struggled up and lurched across 
the room. 

Nice? Nice? The word dug at 
him mercilessly as he fumbled 
for the door. 

He found it. rushed into the 
hall. Her door opened and she 
stood in the half light, the robe 
hanging from one spongy shoulder. 

He jolted to a halt. "Get out of 
here!" he yelled. 
No. 

He made a convulsive move for 
her, hands out like rigid claws. 
The sight of her pink, moist flesh 
spun him away. 

Yes? her mind suggested. It 
seemed as if he heard it spoken 
in a sly rising voice. 

"Listen!" he cried, reaching out 
for the door to his room. "Listen, 
you have to go, do you understand? Go to your mate." 

He twisted back in utter horror. 

/ am with him now, her message had said. 

The thought paralyzed him. He 
stared, open-mouthed, heart 
pounding in slow, gigantic beats 
as the robe slipped over her 




shoulders and started down her 
arms. 

He whirled with a cry and 
slammed the door behind him. 
His fingers shook on the lock. 
Her thoughts were a wailing in 
his mind. He shook in fright and 
sickness and knew it was no good 
because he couldn't lock her out. 

*T"iHERE were monkeys chatter™ ing in his brain. They lay on 
their backs in a circle and kicked 
at the inside of his skull. They 
grabbed juicy blobs of gray in 
their dirty paws and they; 
squeezed. 

He rolled on his side with a 
groan. /'// go crazy, he said. Like 
Corrigan, like all of them but the 
first one — that slimy one who 
started it all; who added % new 
and hideous warp to the corrugation of her dominating mind— 
who had named her Lover because he meant it. 

Suddenly he sat up with a gasp 
of terror, staring at the foot of 
the bed. She comes through the 
walls, howled his brain. Nothing 
there, his eyes saw. His fingersclutched at the sheets. He felt 
sweat dripping off his brow and 
rolling down the embankment of 
his nose. 

He lay back. Up again ! He 
whimpered like a frightened child. 
A cloud of blackness was falling 
over him. He groaned, "No," in 
the blackness. 



LOVER WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 93 




 



No UH. 

He whined. Sleep. Sleep. The 
word throbbed, swelled and depressed in his brain. This was 
the time. He knew it, knew it, 
knew . . . 

The blade falling, sanity decapitated and twitching bloody in 
the basket. 

No! 

He tried to push himself up, 
but he couldn't. Sleep. A black 
tide of night hovering, tracking. 
Sleep. 

He fell on the pillow, pushed 
up weakly on one elbow. 

"No." His lungs were crusted. 
"No." 

He struggled. It was too much. 
He screamed a thick bubbling 
scream. She threw his will aside, 
snapped and futile. She was using 
all her strength now and he was 
de-enervated, beaten. He thudded 
back on" the pillow, glassy-eyed 
and limp. He moaned weakly and 
his eyes shut, opened, shut, 
opened, shut . . . 

The dream again. Insane. Not 
a dream. 

When he woke up, there were 
no flowers. The courtship was 
ended. He gaped blankly and unbelievingly at the imprint of a 
body beside him on the bed. 

It was still warm and moist. 

HE laughed out loud. He wrote 
curse words in his diary. He 
wrote them in tall black letters, 



holding the pencil like a knife. 
He wrote them in the log book 
too. He tore up vouchers if they 
were not the right color. His 
entries were crooked, lines of figures like wavy-numbered tendrils. 
Sometimes he didn't care about 
that. Mostly he didn't notice. 

He prowled the filled warehouse behind locked doors, redeyed and muttering. He clambered up on the bundles and stared 
out through the skylight at the 
empty sky. He was lighter by 
fifteen pounds, unwashed. His 
face was black with wiry growth. 
He was going to have an immaculate beard. She wanted it. She 
didn't want him to wash or shave 
or be healthy. She called him 
Jeff dear. 

You can't fight that, he told 
himself. You can't win because 
yqv lose. If you advance you 
are retreating because, when you 
are too tired to fight, she comet 
back and she takes your body 
and your soul. 

That was why he whispered to 
the warehouse so no one would 
hear, "There is & thing to do. 
And that was why, at night, he 
sneaked to the living room and 
put the gas pistol in his pocket. 
Never harm the Gnees. Well, that 
was wrong. It was kill or be 
killed. 

That's why I'm taking the 
pistol to bed with me. That's why 
I'm stroking it as I stare' up at 



LOVER WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 



the ceiling. Yes, this is it. This ia 
my rock to rest on through the 
day-nights. 

And he turned over plans as 
an animal snuffles over flat stones 
to find bugs for supper. 

Days. Days. Days. 

He whispered, "Kill her." 

He nodded and smiled to himself and patted the cool metal. 

"You're my friend," he said. 
"You're my only friend. She has 
to die. We all know that." 

He made lots of plans and they 
were all the same one. He killed 
her a million times in his mind, 
in secret chambers of his mind 
that he had discovered and 
opened; where he could crouch 
clever and undisturbed while he 
made his plans. 

He walked and looked at the 
Worker's village. 

Animals. I'm not going to end 
up like you. I'm not going to 
I'm not going to and when I do 
I'm not I am . . . 

T INDELL lurched up from his 
office desk, eyes wide, slaver 
funning over his lips. He held the 
pistol tight in his palsied hand. 

He flung open the office door 
and staggered over the concrete, 
through the lanes between roofhigh stacks. His mouth was so 
tight that his clamped jaws hurt. 
He held the pistol pointing. 

He kicked up the catch and 
dragged back one heavy door. He 



plunged out into the hot sunlight and broke into a run. Wisps 
of terror licked out from the 
house. He thought of murder with 
harder, more savage joy. He ran 
faster. He fell down because his 
legs had no feeling. The pistol 
went flying. He crawled to it and 
tenderly brushed off the dust. 

He stood up dizzily and started 
to hobble. He was hearing things 
— not Lover's thoughts, for once. 

He looked up and blinked and 
knew he was going insane . . . 

It was a cargo ship. The cargo 
ship. Only, of course, it couldn't 
be. 

He dropped the pistol and 
slumped down beside it, plucking 
at blue grass with an idiot intensity that he knew was like 
the Gnee men's. He was careful 
not to watch the ship as it seemed 
to come down and the hatches 
made an impossibly convincing 
clang and men appeared to climb 
out. 

"Go away," he said to the illusion of a man standing beside 
him. "You*re not here. The six 
months aren't over." 

His voice was quite normal, except that it broke into giggles 
and sobs while he had a fist fight 
with the air. 

"You'll be all right," the man 
apparently said, and he felt something that might have been an 
insect bite, though he thought it 
was the man pricking him with a 




 



hypo of sedative. 

Two other men came with a 
stretcher and a sheet that they 
wrapped him tightly in, and they 
began carrying him, shrieking and 
battling, toward the mirage ship. 

"You can't take me away!" 
he shouted . 11 1 ' ve go t to kill 
Lover first!" 

"It wouldn't do any good," the 
first man said. "There are a lot 
more where she came from — 
one at a time for every guy we 
station here, it looks like." 

"She comes through the walls!" 
Lindell screamed. 

"That's what you get to believe," said the man soothingly. 
"It must be pretty fierce. But 



that's all over now. You're going 
back home." 

Lindell tried to fight free of 
the sheet. "Let me at least warn 
the next guy!" 

"It wouldn't do any good. He 
wouldn't believe you. That's why 
you didn't see us take away the 
poor character you relieved." 

And then the sedative took hold 
and Lindell fell asleep. The 
dreams came, but with them was 
the sound of rockets blasting off, 
and the spongy image of the Gnee 
woman grew smaller and smaller 
and less frightful. 

But he still smelled the livid 
flowers. He knew he always would.

LOVER WHEN YOU'RE NEAR ME 




THIS month I am going to 
devote the main section "of 
this department to a chart 
of the chemical elements. Well, 
it won't really be a "chart" because I don't intend to waste 
space in GALAXY for something 



that can be looked up in any 
chemistry textbook. Hence isotopes, whether natural or artificial, will not be mentioned, and 
not a line will be wasted on 
melting or boiling points, nor will 
there be chemical information or

electrical characteristics. All that 
can be found in textbooks and 
handbooks. What I am concerned 
with — and it took a good deal of 
time to get this information together — will be of no use to chemists or engineers. But tt will. I 
hope, be interesting. I want to 
write about the names of the 
elements, what they mean and. 
why their discoverers proposed 
them. 

Element No. 1 is. of course, hydrogen. Nicolas Lemery of France 
discovered it around 1700 and 
suspected that water was one 
of its compounds. The other component of water, oxygen, clement 
No. 16, was discovered by Joseph 
Priestly of England and Karl 
Wilhelm Scheele of Sweden some 
75 years later and when it was 
established that elements 1 and 
16 made water (at first thought 
to be HO) the names were tagged 
on. Hydor, a Greek word, means 
water, hence hydrogen, meaning 
"water-former." The other component of water seemed to be in 
every acid, hence the name oxygen, "acid-former." 

Now we know that there are 
acids without oxygen, but none 
without hydrogen. And since the 
oxygen atom is much heavier 
than the hydrogen atom, there is 
far more oxygen in water than 
hydrogen, even though the formula is H-..0. In short, element No. 
1 should "be called oxygen and 



No. 16 should be hydrogen. But 
it's a little late to change them 
around now. 

Element No. 2 is helium, from 
Helios, the Greek sun god, for the 
reason that it was found in the 
solar atmosphere first (by Jules 
Janssen of France in 1868) before Sir William Ramsey discovered it in the Earth's atmosphere 
(1895). No. 3 was named by its 
discoverer, Swede Johan A. Arfwedson of Sweden (1817), without noticeable thought or 
imagination. Lithos is Greek for 
"stone," the ore it came from 
looked like stone, hence lithium. 
No. 4 also got its name from the 
mineral in which it occurs. It 
happens to be green and in Latin 
there is a word beryllinus which 
means green-colored, so the element was called beryllium. Similarly, the name of No. 9 was 
derived from one of its minerals. 
The mineral was used — and still 
is — as a flux in metallurgical operations. German miners, consequently, called the mineral 
Fluss-spat, which became fluorspar by adaptation of the Latin 
word fluere, "to flow." Fluorspar 
is the fluoride of calcium and the 
element was called fluorine. There 
happens to be a minor and accidental justification for the name: 
it "flows out" of almost anything 
you try to keep it in. 

No. 10, neon, means " the new" 
because it obviously was new 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



when Sir William Ramsay discovered it in 1898. But No. 11 is 
less obvious. You may have wondered why the chemical symbol 
for sodium is Na. The common 
English name is derived from 
soda, but the symbol is derived 
from the word Natrium, which 
was both common and mysterious 
until somebody found out that 
that the original is an Arabic 
word nefer, meaning "herb-ash," 
as distinct from kalyun, "woodash," and accounts for the letter 
K as the symbol for No. 19. 

That K stands for the -international name kalium, but the 
English name was derived from 
pot ash, making it potassium. 
Both were first isolated in 1808 
by S^r Humphry Davy, who isolated No. 12, magnesium, at the 
same time. That name is from 
the mineral magnesia, which was 
named in turn after an ancient 
city. Similarly aluminum. No. 13, 
was named after its mineral, 
alum, while No. 14, silicon, got 
its name from si7ex, which in this 
case is not the trade mark of a 
coffee maker, but the Latin word 
for flint. 

No. 15, phosphorus, has a 
Greek name which is meaningful 
and fitting; it translates as "carrier of light." The knowledge of 
No. 16, sulphur, however, is so 
old that the meaning of its name 
is no longer remembered. Since 
No. 17, chlorine, is a greenish 



gas, its discoverer, Karl Wilhelm 
Scheele, just used the Greek word 
for "green" (c/i/oros) to name it. 
Sir William Ramsay utilized the 
Greek word for "sluggish" to 
name No. 18, argon, because it 
did not want to combine with 
anything else. No. 20, calcium, 
one of Sir Humphry Davy's discoveries, derives its name from 
the Latin calx, "burned lime." 

When Lars Nilson discovered 
No. 21 in 1879, he called it scandium, after Scandinavia, but his 
compatriot Baron Jons Jakob 
Berzelius, discoverer, among 
other things, of No. 22, titanium, 
had to justify his choice with 
the excuse that, in Greek mythology, the titans were the "sons 
of the Earth." No. 23, vanadium, 
was discovered and named by 
Nils Sef strom of Sweden in 1830. 
He derived it from the Germanic 
goddess Vanadis, better known 
as Freya, for no reason except 
that he apparently liked the 
sound. 

No. 24, chromium, is from 
thromos, the G ret k word for 
"color*' or "dye"; you know what 
a pronounced color chromiumyellow has. But No. 25, manganese, is a puzzle. Nobody seems 
to know the derivation of the 
word, except that one commentator remarked that the mineral 
from which manganese is derived 
was wrongly called "black magnesia" for a while. Since me/as 



TOO. 




 



is Greek for black, I could understand the connection if the element were called melanganese. 
Maybe it was at one time, but 
I have yet to find proof. 

In the case of No. 26, iron, we 
have one of the few elements 
which have been known for so 
long that their names have no 
derivation. The chemical symbol 
FE comes from the Latin ferrum 
and the Greek equivalent sideros 
can be encountered as siderite, 
indicating an iron meteorite. 

Cobalt and nickel, Nos. 27 and 
28, are both German, the former 
meaning gnome (Kobofd) . the 
latter meaning water sprite. The 
nasty creatures fooled the brave 
miners, handing them ores that 
looked like silver ore, but were 
completely worthless, since applied metallurgy had not yet 
progressed to the extraction of 
the metals. They were discovered, 
for the record, by two Swedes, 
cobalt by Georg Brandt in 1735 
and nickel by Axel Cronstedt in 
1754. 

No. 29, copper, although known 
since antiquity, has a name that 
is still traceable. The chemical 
symbol Cu is from the Latin 
name cuprum, and cuprum is in 
all probability derived from the 
island of Cyprus, which was pronounced "keeprus." 

No. 30, zinc, is German again, 
from the word Zinke, which 
means protrusion because it sub


limed in the furnace and condensed in protrusions in the 
cooler parts. Nos. 31 and 32 are 
Gallium and Germanium; the 
two discoverers, Lecoq de Boisbaudran (1875) and Klemens 
Winkler (1886), honored their 
respective countries. No. 33 is 
arsenic, said to have been isqlated first by Albertus Magnus. 
The name, at any event, is Greek; 
arsen means "strong" or "masculine." 

Selenium, No. 34, is one of the 
discoveries of Jons Jakob Berzelius and is named for the goddess of the Moon, Selene, in the 
Greek pantheon. I suppose he 
had a reason. 

There is a very apparent reason, though, for the name of 
No. 35. The Greek word bromoa 
means "stench"' and the discoverer, the Frenchman AntoineJeiome Balard (1825), found out 
during his experiments that some 
of the compounds offend the nose. 
The name of No. 36 is Greek, 
too, for krypton means "hidden" 
and that's how Sir William Ramsay found it — concealed among 
the other so-called noble gases. 

The names of the next few elements in the table are also simple, 
once you know what they mean. 
No. 37 is rubidium because of 
its ruby-red line in the spectrum; 
No. 38 is strontium after Strontian in County Argyll, Scotland; 
No. 39 is yttrium after Yttcrby in

Sweden; and No. 40 is zirconium 
after the name of the gem. 

No. 41 was once called columbium in English-speaking countries, where students had to 
remember that the symbol for columbium was Nb. The origin of 
the symbol, the international 
name niobium, has now been officially accepted and columbium 
will hence be found only in outof-date textbooks. 

No. 42, its discoverer Peter 
Jakob Hjelm of Sweden thought 
in 1781, looks rather like lead. 
Using the Greek name molybdos, 
meaning lead, he called it molybdenum. No. 43 was originally 
called Masurium, after the landscape of Masuren in East Prussia. 
But^since the two discoverers, 
firs. Walter Noddack and Ida 
Tacke, merely proved its existence while Oak Ridge actually 
produced it, the original name 
has been discarded in favor of 
technecium from the Greek 
techne, "skill." 

No. 43, discovered in 1844 by 
Karl Karlovitch Klaus, was also 
given a geographical name, ruthenium, from Ruthenia — Russia. 
The interesting point is that 
G. W. Osann gave it the same 
name in 1828, sixteen years prior 
to actual isolation. Nos. 45 and 
46 were both discovered by William Hyde Wollaston in 1803-4; 
No. 45 was called rhodium from 
the Greek word rhodos for "rose," 



while No. 46 was called palladium, after the then newly discovered planetoid Pallas. 

Silver is No. 47 and known for 
so long a time that the meaning 
of the name is lost; the symbol 
Ag is from the Latin name' for 
it, ar^enrum. No. 48, cadmium, 
is named after the mineral cadmea; No. 49, indium, has nothing directly to do with India, 
being derived from the indigoblue line in its spectrum — but the 
name of that color is derived 
from the name of the plant, which 
in turn honors the geographical 
area. No. 50, tin, is one of the 
long known elements; the symbol 
Sn is from the Latin name srannum. 

The very similar symbol for 
No. 51, Sb, stands for the Latin 
name stibium, but the English 
word antimony is Latin, too. Its 
origin is the first two words anti 
monachon, "against the monks," 
in an edict of Frances II of 
France, forbidding its medicinal 
use by clergy. 

No. 52. tellurium, is from the 
Latin tellus for Earth; No. 53, 
iodine, from the Greek ioeides for 
the color violet; and No. 54, 
xenon, one of Sir William Ramsey's Greek names, means "stranger." Both No. 55 caesium (from 
Latin caesius, "bluish") and No. 
56, barium, (from Greek barys, 
"heavy") seem to make no sense, 
for caesium looks like silver and 




 



barium is hardly heavier than 
aluminum. But "bluish*' refers 
to a line in the spectrum and 
"heavy" refers to the mineral. 

The numbers 57 to 71 are the 
so-called rare earth elements of 
which a chemist once wrote that 
they pursue the chemist in his 
dreams, that they split like amebas and that their chronology 
looks like a list of "begats" from 
the Old Testament. 

Their names reflect some of the 
unhappiness they seem to have 
caused. No. 57, lanthanum, is 
from the Greek word lanthano, 
which means "to escape notice." 
No. 58, cerium, was named in 
1803 after the recently discovered 
planetoid Ceres (not after the 
goddess directly) ; No. 59, praseodymium, is Greek again, meaning 
"green twin." No. 60, neodymium, 
is also Greek: "new twin" (the 
former didymium had split in 
two). No. 61, long missing, was 
first called Illinium (University 
of Illinois), but Oak Ridge, after 
definite identification, changed 
that to promethium, from Prometheus, the mythical giver of 
fire. 

No. 62, samarium, was named 
by a Frenchman after the Russian mine inspector Samarski. 
No. 63, europium, was also 
named by a Frenchman, Demargay, after the continent, of 
course. No. 64, gadolinium, was 
named in honor of the Finnish 



chemist Gadolin; No. 65, Terbium, after Ytterby in Sweden; 
No. 66, dysprosium, comes from 
the Greek word dysprosopon, 
which means "difficult mask." 
No. 67, Holmium, is derived from 
Holmia, the Latin name of Stockholm; No. 68. erbium, again after 
Ytterby; No. 69, thulium, from 
Thule, the hard - to - identify 
northern land of Pytheas of 
Massilia. 

No. 70 is ytterbium, again 
Ytterby in Sweden! That place 
has a total of four elements 
named after it, three of them rare 
earths, all found in the unusually 
interesting mine that is located 
there. 

No. 71, lutetium, comes from 
Lutet^a, the Latin name for 
Paris, and No. 72, the first element after the rare earth group, 
is hafnium, from Kjobenhavn, 
the Danish spelling of Copenhagen. Its discoverer was a Hungarian, Georg von Hevesy, but 
he commemorated the city in 
which he made the discovery (in 
1923). 

There was once, you probably 
remember, a mythical shade who 
was punished after death by being made to stand in water up 
to his neck, but every time he 
tried to bend down and quench 
his thirst, the water receded. 
When Gustaf Ekeberg found (in 
1802) a metal which is insoluble 
in most acids, he thought of this 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



I0» 



ancient victim and named the 
metal after him: tantalum. Tantalus, by the way, had a daughter 
by the name of Niobe and she 
provided the name for No. 41. 

Tungsten is the Swedish word 
for "heavy stone" and was once 
the name of element No. 74. But 
its chemical symbol was W for 
Wolfram, which was adopted two 
years ago by an international 
congress, so tungsten is no longer 
correct. No. 75, rhenium, discovered by the same team which 
announced "masurium," got its 
name from the Latin Rhenus, 
"Rhine." No. 76 is osmium, actually not a nattering name because osm& (Greek) means "bad 
odor." Its discoverer, the Englishman Smithson Tennant, also discovered No. 77, iridium, which 
he named because of its iridescent solutions. No. 78 is platinum, 
a Spanish word meaning "little 
silver." No. 79 is gold; the Germanic word is essentially a parallel form of the word "yellow" for 
quite obvious reasons. The symbol Au is from the Latin name 
aurum. No. 80 is mercury (in 
German still QuecksiJber) , the 
symbol Hg coming from the old 
name hydrargium. No. 81, thallium, derives from the Greek 
thatlos, "green twig." 

Lead is No. 82 and the word 
is probably a variant of "load" 
(you used it to weigh down 
things, but lodestone, which is 



magnetic iron ore, comes from 
the verb "to lead"). The German 
name, Wei, is derived from that 
old Germanic word fc/a which 
means both "black" and "blue;" 
to this day, a German soldier 
will refer to bullets as "blue 
beans." The symbol Pb is from 
the Latin plumbum, which is also 
the root of "plumber." No. 83, 
bismuth, has an originally German name, which in modern 
rendering would read Wiesematte and denotes a "flowering 
meadow", a name that makes 
sense if you know the colorful 
display of a pan of hardening 
bismuth. 

Above bismuth, we get into the 
realm of the radioactive elements, 
mostly of recent discovery and 
with artificial names. No. 84 is 
polonium, so named by Madame 
Sklodowska-Curie after her native Poland. No. 85, first called 
alabamine (after the state) is 
now known as astatine from the 
Greek astasia, "unsteady". No. 
86 is radon, once called "emanation," from the Latin radius for 
"ray;" No. 88, radium, has the 
same derivation. 

No. 87; discovered in 1947 by 
Mile. Marguerite Percy, is called 
franchium, and No. 89 is actinium. Of the radioactive elements, only the more stable ones, 
No. 90, thorium, and No. 92, 
uranium, have been known for 
a considerable time. The former 



10* 




 



was discovered by Jons Jakob 
Berzelius and named after the 
Norse god Thor, the latter by 
Martin Heinrich Klaproth and 
named after the planet Uranus. 

No. 91 is protactinium and 
above 92 we have the obvious 
neptunium (No. 93) and plutonium (No. 94) ; americium 
("made in America") as No. 95; 
curium (after Madame Curie) as 
No. 96 and, so far the heaviest, 
Berkelium (Berkeley, Calif.) as 
No. 97. 

As you can see, naming elements is an arbitrary, inaccurate 
and often sentimental business. 
Luckily, the origins quickly lose 
their identities and we are aware 
only of the properties of these 
basic substances. And they did, 
after all, need some name and 
these do as well as any others.

ANY QUESTIONS? 

How would the pilot of a ship 
in space recognize Earth at a 
glance and could he tell his distance, even roughly, by its brightness? 

Earth could be recognized by 
its color and by the presence 
of a single large moon. Mars, 
when seen from space, looks 
reddish, Venus a pure white, 
while Earth must be hhie-green. 
Saturn, of course, has its rings 
as a distinctive feature and 



Jupiler its stripes and four 
large moons. If the ship were 
at ihe orbit of Venue, Earth 
can look six times as brilliant 
as Venus at her brightest appears to us. Even the Moon 
would be almost as bright as 
Venus is to us. Seen from the 
orbit of Mars, Earth would look 
about as bright as Jupiter does 
from Earth at greatest proximity. If the ship is at points 
outside the orbit of Jupiter, the 
pilot would need instruments 
to see Earth, which at such distance would be "lost" in the 
glare of the Sun. 

Just what is the velocity of 
light? 186,000 mites per second 
sounds like a rounded-off figure. 

It is, and so is the customary 
metric equivalent of 300,000 
kilometers per second. The 06Merver's Handbook gives the 
more precise value of 299,774 
km. p. sec. Some values obtained in 1949 and 1950 by 
various investigators read as 
follows: 

Aslakson 299,792 + 2.4 
Essen 299,792.5 -f 3.0 

Bol 299,798.3 -f 0.4 

Bergstrand 299,792.7 + 0.25 

In your Conquest of Space you 
list the planetoid Adonis as the 
one which comes nearest to the 
Sun, staying just outside the orbit 
of Mercury. But since the orbit 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



103 



of Mercury is so eccentric, isn't 
it possible that Adonis might 
cross the orbit of Mercury on 
occasion? 

To the best of our knowledge 
Adonis floes not. But we now 
know a male planetoid that 
does. It has heeti appropriately 
named learns anil it gets murh 
Hotter to the Sun than the 
mythical learns ever did. Mercury, when closest to the Sun, 
im 0-31 astronomical units (one 
astronomical unit, or A. H., is 
the distance of Earth from the 
Sun) from the primary, while 
Icarus gets to within 0.20 A.U. 
or around 19 million miles. 
!\1 aximtim distance of I varus 
from the sun is 1.97 A.U., 
ftmghly twice that of Earth. 
More precisely, it is 183 million 
miles. The small planetoid is 
less than a mile in diameter and 
probably reaches a temperature 
of 1000° F. at perihelion. 

In the film Destination Moon, 
there is a short sentence hinting 
at the use of titanium for spaceship construction. In what respect would titanium be superior 
to other metals? I have not seen 
it used anywhere. 

The reason why titanium is 
not in use right now to a BO* 
tireahle extent is simply due to 
the fact that it became commercially available only two 
years or so ago. I -have seen 



some small parts made of it. 
It looks like silver, though less 
shiny, and has generally the 
characteristics of stainless sleet. 
It differs from steel in two respects of interest to an engiurrr — it is non-magnetic, and 
its specific gravity is only 4.5 
while that of steel is 7.8. llrinlein probably picked titanium 
as a "light-weight steel" for 
construction purposes. 

Why is it that you get ice 
cubes faster if you put lukewarm 
water into the trays of your refrigerator rather than ice water? 

If I had not been prepared, 
this question would have surprised me no end. But a few 
years ago I talked to one of 
the researchers of the Bureau 
of Standards in Washington, 
D. C, who told me that thla 
is a fairly widespread popular 
su;-,; :siili<>n and that the lliircau re; - rived so many inquiries 
alumi it that they finally deeideil to lest it. The answer is 
astonishingly simple: because 
of the high latent heat of water, 
a few degrees more or less do 
not make a difference which 
could be noticed without measuring it. Of course, the colder 
the water, the sooner it will 
freeze, but the freezing differ* 
cnee between water of 35° F 
and water of 55° F is about 
one minute.

Freudian Slip 

By FRANKLIN ABEL 

Illustrated by HARRINGTON 

Things are exactly what they 
seem? Life is real? Lite is 
earnest? Welt, that depends. 

ON the day the Earth van- Herman was a tall, serious, sen
ished, Herman Raye was sitive, healthy, well-muscled 

earnestly fishing for trout, young man with an outsize jaw 

liip. deep in a mountain stream in and a brush of red-brown hair, 

upstate New York. He wore spectacles to correct a

slight hyperopia, and they had 
heavy black rims because he knew 
his patients expected it. In his 
off hours, he was fond of books 
with titles like Personality and 
the Behavior Disorders, Selfesteem and Sexuality in Women, 
Juvenile Totem and Taboo: A 
study of adolescent culturegroups, and A New Theory ol 
Economic Cycles; but he also 
liked baseball, beer and bebop. 

This day, the last of Herman's 
vacation, was a perfect specimen: 
sunny and still, the sky dotted 
with antiseptic tufts of cloud. The 
trout were biting. Herman had 
two in his creel, and was casting 
into the shallow pool across the 
stream in the confident hope of 
getting another^ when the Universe gave one horrible sliding 
lurch. 

Herman braced himself instinctively, shock pounding through 
his body, and looked down at the 
pebbly stream-bed under his feet. 

It wasn't there. 

He was standing, to all appearances, in three feet of clear water 
with sheer, black nothing under 
it: nothing, the abysmal color of 
a moonless night, pierced by the 
diamond points of a half-dozen 
incredible stars. 

He had only that single 
glimpse; then he found himself 
gazing across at the pool under 
the far bank, whose waters reflected the tranquil imagery of 



trees. He raised his casting rod, 
swung it back over his snoulder, 
brought it forward again with a 
practiced flick of his wrist, and 
watched the lure drop. 

Within the range of his vision 
now, everything was entirely 
normal ; nevertheless, Herman 
wanted very much to stop fishing 
and look down to see if that horrifying void was still there. He 
couldn't do it. 

Doggedly, he tried again and 
again. The result was always the 
same. It was exactly as if he were 
a man who had made up his mind 
to fling himself over a cliff, or 
break a window and snatch a 
loaf of bread, or say in a loud 
voice to an important person at 
a party, "I think you stink." Determination was followed by effort, by ghastly, sweating, heartstopping fear, by relief as he gave 
up and did something else. 

All right, he thought Finally. 
there's no point going on with it. 
Data established: hallucination, 
compulsion, inhibition. Where do 
we go from here? 

The obvious first hypothesis 
was that he was insane. Herman 
considered that briefly, and left 
the question open. Three or four 
selected psychoanalyst jokes paraded through his mind, led by 
the classic, "You're fine, how am 
I?" 

There was this much truth, he 
thought, in the popular belief 



1*8 




 



that all analysts were a little 
cracked themselves: a good proportion of the people who get all 
the way through the man-killing 
course that makes an orthodox 
analyst — a course in which an 
M. D. degree is only a beginning 
— arc impelled to do so in the 
first place by a consuming interest in their own neuroses. Herman, for example, from the age of 
fifteen up until the completion 
of his own analysis at twenty-six, 
had been so claustrophobic that 
he couldn't force himself into a 
subway car or an elevator. 

But was he now insane? 

Can a foot-rule measure itself? 

Herman finished. At an appropriate hour he waded ashore, 
cleaned his catch, cooked it and 
ate it Where the ground had 
been bare around his cooking 
spot, he saw empty darkness, 
star-studded, rimmed by a tangled webwork of bare rootlets. He 
tried to go on looking at it when 
he had finished eating the fish. 
He couldn't. 

After the meal, he tried to take 
out his notebook and pen. He 
couldn't. 

In fact, it occurred to him, he 
was helpless to do anything that 
he wouldn't normally have done. 

Pondering that discovery, after 
he had cleaned his utensils and 
finished his other chores, Herman 
crawled into his tent and went to 
sleep. 



Burying the garbage had been 
an unsettling experience. Like a 
lunatic building a machine nobody else can see, he had lifted 
successive shovels-full of nothing, 
dropped the empty cans and rubbish ten inches into nothing, and 
shoveled nothing carefully over 
them again ... 

TPHE light woke him, long before dawn. From where he lay 
on his back, he could see an incredible pale radiance streaming 
upward all around him, outlining 
the shadow of his body at the 
ridge of the tent, picking out the 
under -surfaces of the trees against 
the night sky. He strained, until 
he was weak and dizzy, to roll 
over so that he could see its 
source; but he had to give up and 
wait another ten minutes until 
his body turned "naturally," just 
as if he had still been asleep. 

Then he was looking straight 
down into a milky transparency 
that started under his nose 
and continued into unguessablc 
depths. First came the matted 
clumps of grass, black against the 
light, every blade and root as 
clear as if they had been set in 
transparent plastic. Then longer, 
writhing roots of trees and shrubs, 
sprouting thickets of hair-thin 
rootlets. Between these, and continuing downward level by level, 
was spread an infinity of tiny 
specks, seed-shapes, spores. Some 



FREUDIAN SUP 



of them moved, Herman realized 
with a shock. Insects burrowing 
in the emptiness where the Earth 
should be? 

In the morning, when he 
crawled out of the tent and went 
to the bottomless stream to wash, 
he noticed something he had 
missed the day before. The network of grasses gave springily 
under his feet — not like turf, but 
like stretched rubber. Her ma n 
conceived an instant dislike for 
walking, especially when he had 
to cross bare ground, because 
when that happened, he felt exactly what he saw: nothing whatever underfoot. "Walking on air," 
he realized, was not as pleasant 
an experience as the popular songs 
would lead you to expect. 

Herman shaved, cooked and ate 
breakfast, washed the dishes, did 
the chores, and packed up his 
belongings. With a mighty effort, 
he pried out the tent stakes, which 
were bedded in nothing but a 
loose network of roots. He shouldered the load and carried it a 
quarter of a mile through pine 
woods to his car. 

The car stood at ground level, 
but the ground was not there any 
more. The road was now nothing 
more than a long, irregular trough 
formed by the spreading roots of 
the pines on either side. Shuddering, Herman stowed his gear in 
the trunk and got in behind the 
wheel. 



When he put the motor into 
gear, the sedan moved sedately 
and normally forward. But the 
motor raced madly, and there was 
no feeling that it was taking hold. 
With screaming engine, Herman 
drove homeward over a nonexistent road. Inwardly and silently, 
he gibbered. 

Six miles down the mountain, 
he pulled up beside a whitepainted fence enclosing a neat 
yard and a fussy little blue-shuttered house. On the opposite side 
of the fence stood a middle-aged 
woman with a floppy hat awry on 
her head and a gardening trowel 
in one of her gloved hands. She 
looked up with an atr of vague 
dismay when he got out of the 
car. 

"Some more eggs today. Dr. 
Raye?" she asked, and smiled. 
The srnile was like painted china, 
Her eyes, lost in her fleshy face, 
were clearly trying not to look 
downward. 

"Not today, Mrs. Richards," 
Herman said. "I just stopped to 
say good-by. I'm on my way 
home-" 

"Isn't that a shame?" she said 
mechanically. "Well, come again 
next year." 

Herman wanted to say, "Next 
year I'll probably be in a straitjacket." He tried to say it. He 
stuttered, ''N-n-n-n — "and ended, 
glancing at the ground at her feet, 
"Transplanting some petunias?" 



11* 




 



The woman's mouth worked. 
She said, "Yes. I thought I 
might's well put them along here, 
where they'd get more sun. Aren't 
they pretty?" 

"Very pretty," said Herman 
helplessly. 

The petunias, roots as naked as 
if they had been scrubbed, were 
nesting in a bed of stars. Mrs. ' 
Richards' gloves and trowel were 
spotlessly clean. 

|^VN Fourth Avenue, below 
Fourteenth Street, Herman 
met two frightful little men. 

He had expected the city to be 
better, but it was worse; it was 
a nightmare. The avenues between the buildings were bottomless troughs of darkness. The bedrock was gone; the concrete was 
gone; the asphalt was gone. 

The buildings themselves were 
hardly recognizable unless you 
knew what they were. New York 
had been a city of stone — built 
on stone, built of stone, as cold 
as stone. 

Uptown, the city looked halfbuilt, but insanely occupied, a 
forest of orange-painted girders. 
In the Village the old brick 
houses were worse. No brick; no 
mortar; nothing but the grotesque 
shells of rooms in lath and a 
pa per- thickness of paint. 

The wrought-iron railings were 
gone, too. 

On Fourth Avenue, bookseller's 



row, you could almost persuade 
yourself that nothing had happened, provided you did not look 
down. The buildings had been 
made of wood, and wood they remained. The second-hand books 
in their wooden racks would have 
been comforting except that they 
were so clean. There was not a 
spot of dirt anywhere; the air was 
more than country-pure. 

There was an insane selective 
principle at work here, Herman 
realized. Everything from bedrock 
to loam that belonged to the 
Earth itself had disappeared. So 
had everything that had a mineral origin and been changed by 
refinement and mixture: concrete, 
wrought iron, brick, but steel and 
glass, porcelain and paint remained. It looked as if the planet 
had been the joint property of 
two children, one of whom didn't 
want to play any more, so they 
had split up their possessions — 
this is yours, this is yours, this 
is mine . . . 

The two little men popped into 
view not six feet in front of 
Herman as he was passing a sidewalk bookstall. Both were dressed 
in what looked like workmen's 
overalls made of lucite chainmail, or knitted glow-worms. One 
of them had four eyes, two brown, 
two blue, with spectacles for the 
middle pair. Ears grew like cabbages all over his bald head. The 
other had two eyes, the pupils

111 



of which were cross-shaped, and 
no other discernible features except when he opened his gaptoothed mouth: the rest of his 
head, face and all, was completelycovered by a dense forest of red 
hair. 

As they came forward, Herman's control of his body suddenly returned. He was trying his 
best to turn around and go away 
from there, and that was what 
his body started to do. Moreover, 
certain sounds of a prayerful 
character, namely "Oh dear sweet 
Jesus," which Herman was forming in his mind, involuntarily issued from his lips. 

Before he had taken the first 
step in a rearward direction, however, the hairy little man curved 
around him in a blur of motion, 
barring the way with two long, 
muscular, red-furred arms. Herman turned. The four-eyed little 
man had closed in. Herman, gasping, backed up against the bookstall. 

People who were headed directly for them, although showing 
no recognition that Herman and 
the little men were there, moved 
stiffly aside-like dancing automatons, strode past, then made another stiff sidewise motion to 
bring them back to the original 
line of march before they went on 
their way. 

"Olaph dzenn Harm Rai gjo 
glerr-dregnarr?" demanded Hairy. 



Herman gulped, half-stunned. 
"Huh?" he said. 

Hairy turned to Four-Eyes. 
"Grinnr alaz harisi nuya." 

"Izzred alph! Meggi erd-halaza 
riggbord els kamma gredyik. 
Lukhhal!" 

Hairy turned back to Herman. 
Blinking his eyes rapidly, for they 
closed like the shutter of a camera, he made a placating gesture 
with both huge furry hands. 
"Kelagg ikri odrum faz," he said, 
and, reaching out to the bookstall, he plucked out a handful of 
volumes, fanned them like playing cards and displayed them to 
Four-Eyes. A heated discussion 
ensued, at the end of which Hairy 
kept For Whom the Bell Tolls, 
Four-Eyes took The Blonde in the 
Bathtub, and Hairy threw the 
rest away. 

Then, while Herman gaped and 
made retching sounds, the two 
disgusting little men tore pages 
out of the books and stuffed them 
in their mouths. When they finished the pages, they ate the 
bindings. Then there was a rather 
sick pause while they seemed to 
digest the contents of the books 
they had literally devoured. Herman' had the wild thought that 
they were blurb writers whose 
jobs had gone to their heads. 

The one with the four eyes 
rolled three of them horribly. 
"That's more like it," he said in 
nasal but recognizable English.

**Let's start over. Are you Herman Raye, the skull doc?" 

Herman produced a series of 
incoherent sounds. 

"My brother expresses himself 
crudely," said Hairy in a rich, 
fruity baritone. "Please forgive 
him. He is a man of much heart." 

"Uh?" said Herman, 

"Truly," said Hairy. "And of 
much ears," he added with a 
glance at his companion. "But 
again, as to this affair — tell me 
true, are you Herman Raye, the 
analyst of minds?" 

"Suppose I am ?" Herman 
asked cautiously. 

Hairy turned to Four- eyes. 
"Arghraz iktri 'Suppose I am,' 
Gurh? Olaph iktri err ogromat, 
lekh— " 

"Talk English, cant you?" 
Four-eyes broke in. "You know 
he don't understand, that caveman jabber. Anyhow, yeah, yeah, 
it's him. He just don't want to 
say so." He reached out and took 
Herman by the collar. "Come on, 
boy, the boss is waitin'." 

There were two circular hairlines of glowing crimson where 
Hairy and Four-eyes had originally appeared. They reached the 
spot in one jump, Hairy bringing 
up the rear. 

"But tell me truly," he said 
anxiously. "You are that same 
Herman Raye?" 

Herman paid no attention. Below, under the two glowing circles. 



was the terrifying gulf that had 
replaced the Earth; and this time, 
Herman was somehow convinced, 
it was not going to hold him up. 

"Let go!" he shouted, struggling. "Ouch!" He had struck 
Four-eyes squarely on the flat 
nose, and it felt as if he had 
slugged an anvil. 

Paying no attention, Four-eyes 
turned Herman over, pinned his 
arms to his sides, and dropped 
him neatly through the larger of 
the two circles. 

Herman shut his eyes tightly 
and despairingly repeated the 
multiplication table up to 14 x 14. 
When he opened them again, he 
was apparently hanging in midspace, with Hairy to his left and 
Four-eyes to his right. The visible 
globe around them was so curiously tinted and mottled that it 
took Herman a long time to 
puzzle it out. Ahead of them was 
the darkest area — the void he had 
seen before. This was oval in 
shape, and in places the stars 
shone through it clearly. In 
others, they were blocked off entirely or dimmed by a sort of 
haze. 

Surrounding this, and forming 
the rest of the sphere, was an area 
that shaded from gold shot with 
violet at the borders, to an unbearable blaze of glory at the 
center, back the way they had 
come and a little to the right. 
Within this lighted section were 



FREUDIAN SLIP 



111 



other amorphous areas which 
were much darker, almost: opaque ; 
and still others where the light 
■hone through diluted to a ruddy 
ghost of itself, like candlelight 
through parchment. 

Gradually Herman realised 
that the shapes and colors he saw 
were the lighted and dark hemispheres of Earth. The dark areas 
were the oceans, deep enough in 
most places to shut out the light 
altogether, and those parts of the 
continents, North and South 
America behind him, Europe and 
Asia ahead, Africa down to the 
light, which were heavily forested. 

Herman's earlier conviction returned Things like this just did 
■tot happen. Physician, hoal thy
mtf! 

"You're not real," be said bitterly to Four-eyes. 

••Not very/* Four-eyes agreed. 
*Tm twice as real as that jerk, 
though," he insisted, pointing to 
Hairy. 

Ahead of them, or "below," a 
point of orange light was slowly 
swelling. Herman watched it 
Without much interest. 

Hairy broke out into a torrent 
of cursing. **I this and that in 
the milk of your this!" he said. 
**I this, that and the other in the 
this of your that. Your sister! 
Your cousin! Your grandmother's 
uncle!" 

Four-eyes listened with awed 



approval. "Them was good books, 
hah?" he asked happily. 

"Better than those scratchings 
m the caves,** Hairy said. 

"Something to think about till 
they haul us out again. Well" 
said Four-eyes philosophically, 
"here we are." 

THE orange spot had enlarged 
into the semblance of a 
lighted room, rather like a stage 
setting. Inside were two enormous 
Persons, one sitting, one standing. 
Otherwise, and except for three 
upholstered chairs, the room was 
bare. No — as they swooped down 
toward it, Herman blinked and 
looked again. A leather couch had 
appeared against the far wall. 

At the last moment, there was 
a nicker of motion off to Herman's left. Something that looked 
fike a short, pudgy human being 
accompanied by two little men 
the size of Hairy and Four-eyes 
whooshed off into the distance, 
back toward the surface of the 
planet. 

Herman landed. Hairy and 
Four-eyes, after bowing low to 
the standing Person, turned and 
leaped out of the room. When 
Herman, feeling abandoned, 
turned to see where they had 
gone, he discovered that the room 
now had four walls and no windows or doors. 

The Person said, "How do you 
do, Doctor Raye?" 



114 



• ALAXY SCIINCE FICTION 



Herm an looked at him. Although his figure had a disquieting tendency to quiver and flow, 
so that it was hard to judge, he 
seemed to be about eight feet 
tall. He was dressed in what 
would have seemed an ordinary 
dark-blue business suit, with an 
equally ordinary white shirt and 
blue tie, except that all three 
garments had the sheen of polished metal. His face was bony 
and severe, but not repellently 
so; he looked absent-minded 
rather than stern. 

The other Person, whose suit 
was brown, had a broad, kindly 
and rather stupid face; his hair 
was white. He sat quietly, not 
looking at Herman, or, apparently, at anything else. 

Herman sat down in one of the 
upholstered chairs. "All right," he 
said with helpless defiance. 
"What's it all about?" 

"I'm glad we can cojpe to the 
point at once," said the Person. 
He paused, moving his lips silently. "Ah, excuse me. I'm 
sorry." A second, head, with identical features, popped into view 
next to the first. His eyes were 
closed. "It's necessary, I'm 
afraid," said head number one 
apologetically. "I have so much 
to remember, you know." 

Herman took a deep breath and 
said nothing. 

"You may call me Secundus, 
if you like," resumed the Person, 



"and this gentleman Primus, 
since it is with him that you will 
have principally to deal. Now, 
our problem here is one of amnesia, and I will confess to you 
frankly that we ourselves are totally inadequate to cope with it. 
In theory, we are not subject to 
disorders of the mind, and that's 
what makes us so vulnerable now 
that it has happened. Do you 
see?" 

A fantastic sui picion crept into 
Herman's mind. "Just a moment," he said carefully. "If you 
don't mind telling me, what is it 
that you have to remember?" 

"Well, Doctor, my field is human beings ; that's why it became 
my duty to search you out and 
consult with you. And there is * 
great deal for me to carry in my 
mind, you know, especially under 
these abnormal conditions. I 
don*t think I'm exaggerating 
when I say it is a full-time job." 

"Are you going to tell me," 
asked Herman, more carefully 
still, "that this — gentleman — is 
the one who is supposed to remember the Earth itself? The 
rocks and minerals and so on?'* 

"Yes, exactly. I was about to 
tell you—" 

"And that the planet has disappeared because he has amnesia?" Herman demanded on a 
rising note. 

Secundus beamed, "Concisely 
expressed. I myself, being, m

to speak, saturated with the 
thoughts and habits of human 
beings, who are, you must admit, 
a garrulous race, could not — " 

"Oh, no!" said Herman. 

"Oh, yes," Secundus corrected. 
"I can understand that the idea 
is difficult for you to accept, since 
you naturally believe that you 
yourself have a real existence, or, 
to be more precise, that you belong to the world of phenomena 
as opposed to that of noumena." 
He beamed- "Now I will be silent, a considerable task for me, 
and let you ask questions." 

Herman fought a successful 
battle with his impulse to stand 
itp and shout "To hell with it!" 
He had been through a great deal, 
bu^he was a serious and realistic 
young man. He set himself to 
think the problem through logically. If, as seemed more 
than probable, Secundus, Primus, 
Hairy, Four-eyes, and this whole 
Alice - in - Wonderland situation 
existed only as his hallucinations, 
then it did not matter much 
whether he took them seriously or 
not. If they were real, then he 
wasn't, and vice versa. It didn't 
make any difference which was 
which. 

He relaxed deliberately and 
folded his hands against his abdomen. "Let me see if I can get 
this clear," he said. "I'm a nou^tienon, not a phenomenon. In 
•ruder terms, I exist only in your 



mind. Is that true?" 

Secundus beamed. "Correct." 

"If you got amnesia, I and the 
rest of the human race would 
disappear." 

Secundus looked worried, "That 
is also correct, and if that should 
happen, you will readily understand that we would be in difficulty. The situation is extremely 
— But pardon me. I had promised to be silent except when answering questions." 

"This is the part I fail to understand, Mr. Secundus. I gather 
that you brought me here to treat 
Mr. Primus. Now, if I exist as a 
thought in your mind, you necessarily know everything I know. 
Why don't you treat him yourself?" 

Secundus shook his head disapprovingly. "Oh, no, Dr. Raye, 
that is not the case at all. It 
cannot be said that I know everything that you know; rather 
we should say that I remember 
you. In other words, that I maintain your existence by an act of 
memory. The two functions, 
knowledge and memory, are not 
identical, although, of course, the 
second cannot be considered to 
exist without the first. But before 
we become entangled in our own 
terms, I should perhaps remind 
you that when I employ the word 
'memory' I am only making use 
of a convenient approximation. 
Perhaps it would be helpful to 



GALAXY SCIENCE" FICTION 



say that my memory is comparable to the structure -memory of 
a living organism, although that, 
too, has certain semantic disadvantages. Were you about to 
make a remark, Doctor?" 

"It still seems to me," Herman 
said stubbornly, "that if you remember me, structurally or otherwise, that includes everything I 
remember. If you're going to tell 
me that you remember human 
knowledge, including Freudian 
theory and practice, but are unable to manipulate it, that seems 
to me to be contradicted by internal evidence in what you've already said. For example, it's clear 
that in the field of epistemology — 
the knowledge of knowledge, you 
might say — you have the knowledge and manipulate it." 

"Ah," said Secundus, smiling 
shyly, "but, you see, that happens to be my line. Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy, being 
specializations, are not. As I mentioned previously, persons of our 
order are theoretically not capable of psychic deterioration. 
That is why we come to you. 
Dr. Raye. We are unable to help 
ourselves; we ask your help. We 
place ourselves unreservedly in 
your hands.". 

The question, "How was I 
chosen?" occurred to Herman, but 
he left it unasked. He knew that 
the answer was much likelier to 
be ; "At random," thao, "Because 



we wanted the most brilliant and 
talented psychoanalyst on the 
planet." 

"I gather that I'm not the first 
person you've tried," he said. 

"Oh, you saw Dr. Buddolphson 
departing? Yes, it is true that in 
our ignorance of the subject we 
did not immediately turn to practitioners of your psychological 
orientation. In fact, if you will 
not be offended, I may say that 
you are practically our last hope. 
We have already had one eminent 
gentleman whose method was 
simply to talk over Mr. Primus's 
problems with him and endeavor 
to help him reach an adjustment; 
he failed because Mr. Primus, 
so far as he is aware, has no problems except that he has lost his 
memory. Then we had another 
whose system, as he explained it 
to me, was simply to repeat, in a 
sympathetic manner, everything 
that the patient said to him; Mr. 
Primus was not sufficiently prolix 
for this method to be of avail. 

"Then there was another who 
wished to treat Mr. Primus by 
encouraging him to relive his past 
experiences: 'taking him back 
along the time-track,' as he called 
it; but — 7 Secundus looked 
mournful — "Mr. Primus has actually had no experiences in the 
usual sense of the term, though 
he very obligingly made up a number of them; Our ontogeny. Dr. 
Raye, is so simple that it cam

carcely be said to exist at all. 
Cach of us normally has only one 
unction, the one I have already 
nentioned, and, until this occurence, it has always been fulfilled 
uccessfully. _ 

"Wc also had a man who pro- oted to reawaken Mr. Primus'* 
icmory by electric shock, but 
Tx. Primus is quite impervious

ere unable to hit upon an acptablc substitute. In short. Dr. 
.'aye, if you should prove unable 
o help us, we will have no one 
-ft to fall back upon except, posibly, the Yogi." 

"They might do you more good, 
it that," Herman said, looking 
at Mr. Primus. "Well, I'll do what 
I can, though the function of 
analysis is to get the patient to 
accept reality, and this is the opposite. What can you tell me, 
to begin with, about Mr. Primus's 
personality, the onset of the disturbance, and so on — and. in paricular, what are you two? Who's 
/our boss? What's it all for and 
.iow does it work?" 

Secundus said, "I can give 
you very little assistance, I am 
afraid. I would characterize 
Primus as a very steady person, 
extremely accurate in his work, 
but not very imaginative. His 
memory loss occurred abruptly, 
as you yourself witnessed yesterday afternoon. As to your other 
questions — forgive me, Dr. Raye, 



but it is to your own advantage 
if I fail to answer them. I am, 
of course, the merest amateur in 
psychology, but I sincerely feel 
that your own psyche might be 
damaged if you were to learn the 
fragment of the truth whi<h I 
could give you." 

He paused. A sheaf of papers, 
which Herman had not noticed 
before, lay on a small table that 
he had not noticed, either. Secundus picked them up and handed 
them over. 

"Here are testing materials,** 
he said. "If you need anything 
else, you have only to call on me. 
But I trust you will find these 
complete." 

He turned to go. "And one 
more thing. Dr. Raye," he said 
with an apologetic smile. "Hurry, 
if you possibly can." 

"pRIMUS, looking rather like 
a sarcophagus ornament, lay 
limply supine on the ten-foot 
couch, arms at bis sides, eyes 
closed. When Herman had first 
told him to relax, Primus had had 
to have the word carefully explained to him; from then on he 
had done it — or seemed to do it 
—perfectly: 

In bis preliminary tests, the 
Binet, the Minnesota Multiphasic 
Personality Index and the Berneuter P. I., he had drawn almost 
a complete blank. Standard testing methods did not work on Mr. 



•ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Primus, and the reason was obvious enough. Mr. Primus simply 
was not a human being. 

This room, no doubt, was an 
illusion, and so was Mr. Primus's 
anthropomorphic appearance . . . 

Herman felt like a surgeon trying to operate blindfolded while 
wearing a catcher's mitt on each 
hand. But he kept trying; he was 
getting results, though whether or 
not they meant anything, he was 
unable to guess. 

On the Rorschach they had 
done a little better, at least in volume of response. "That looks like 
a cliff," Primus would say eagerly. "That looks like a — piece 
of sandstone. This part looks like 
two volcanoes and a cave." Of 
course, Herman realized, the poor 
old gentleman was only trying to 
please him. He had no more idea 
than a goldfish what a volcano 
or a rock looked like, but he 
wanted desperately to help. 

Even so, it was possible to score 
the results. According to Herman's interpretation, Primus was 
a case of arrested infantile sexualism, with traces of conversion 
hysteria and a strong Oedipus 
complex. Herman entered the protocol solemnly in his notes and 
kept going. 

Next came free association, 
and, after that, recounting of 
dreams. Feeling that he might as 
well be hanged for a sheep as 
a lamb, Herman carefully ex


plained to Primus what "sleep" 
and "dreams" were. 

Primus had promised to do his 
best ; he had been lying there now, 
without moving, for — how long? 
Startled, Herman looked at his 
watch. It had stopped. 

Scoring the Rorschach alone, 
Herman realized suddenly, should 
have taken him nearly a full day, 
even considering the fact that He 
hadn't eaten anything, or taken 
time out to rest, or— Herman 
bewilderedly felt his jaw. There 
was only the slightest stubble. 
He didn't feel hungry or tired, or 
cramped from sitting . . . 

"Secundus!" he called. 

A door opened in the wall to 
his right, and Secundus stepped 
through. The door disappeared. 

"Yes, Dr. Raye? Is anything 
wrong?" 

"How long have I been here?" 

Secundus' right-hand head 
looked embarrassed. "Well, Doctor, without bringing in the difficult questions of absolute versus, 
relative duration, and the definition of an arbitrary position — " 

"Don't stall. How long have I 
been here in my own subjective 
time?" 

"Well, I was about to say, without being unnecessarily inclusive, 
the question is still very difficult. 
However, bearing in mind that 
the answer is only a rough approximation — about one hundred 
hours." 



FREUDIAN SLIP 



II? 



Herman rubbed bis chin. "I 
don't like your tampering with 
me," he said slowly. "You've 
speeded me up — 4s that it? And 
at the same time inhibited my 
fatigue reactions, and God knows 
what else, so that I didn't even 
notice I'd been working longer 
than I normally could until just 
now?" 

Secundus looked distressed. 
"I'm afraid I have made rather 
a botch of it. Dr. Raye. I should 
not have allowed you to notice 
at all, but it is growing increasingly difficult to restrain your 
fellow-creatures to their ordinary 
routines. My attention strayed, 
1 am sorry to say." He glanced 
at t^ie recumbent form of Primus. 
"My word! What is Mr. Primus 
doing, Dr. Raye?" 

"Sleeping," Herman answered 
curtly. 

"Remarkable! I hope he does 
not make a habit of it. Will he 
awaken soon, do you think, Doctor?" 

"I have no idea," said Herman 
helplessly; but at that moment 
Primus stirred, opened his eyes, 
and sat up with his usual vague, 
kindly smile. 

"Did you dream?" Herman 
asked him. 

Primus blinked slowly. "Yes. 
Yes, I did," he said in his profoundly heavy voice. 

"Tell me all you can remember 
about it." 



"Well, said Primus, sinking 
back onto the couch, "I dreamed 
I was in a room with a large bed. 
It had heavy wooden posts and a 
big bolster. I wanted to lie down 
end rest in the bed, but the bolster 
made me uncomfortable. It was 
too dark to see, to rearrange the 
bed, so I tried to light a candle, 
but the matches kept going 
out . . . n 

Herman took it all down, word 
for word, with growing excitement and growing dismay. The 
dream was too good. It might have 
come but of Dr. Freud's original 
case histories. When Primus had 
finished, Herman searched back 
through his notes. Did Primus 
know what a bed was, or what 
a bolster was, or a candle? How 
much had Herman told him? 

"Bed" was there, of course. 
Primus: "What are 'dreams?' " 
Herman: "Well, when a human 
being goes to bed, and sleeps . . . " 
"Bolster" was there, too, but not 
in the same sense. Herman: "To 
bolster its argument, the unconscious — what we call the id— 
frequently alters the person's likes 
and dislikes on what seem to be 
petty and' commonplace subjects 
..." And "candle?" Herman: "I 
want you to understand that I 
don't know all about this subject 
myself, Mr. Primus. Nobody 
does; our knowledge is just a 
candle in the darkness ..." 

Herman gave up. He glanced 



120 




 



at Secundus, who was watching 
him expectantly. "May I talk to 
you privately?" 

"Of course." Secundus nodded 
to Primus, who stood up awkwardly and -then vanished with 
a pop. Secundus tut-tutted regretfully. 

Herman took a firm grip on 
himself. "Look," he said, "the 
data I have now suggest that 
Primus had some traumatic experience in his infancy which arrested his development in various 
ways and also strengthened his 
Oedipus complex — that is, intensified his feelings of fear, hatred 
and rivalry toward his father. 
Now, that may sound to you as 
if we're making some progress. 
I would feel that way myself— 
if I had the slightest reason for 
believing that Primus ever had 
a father." 

Secundus started to speak; but 
Herman cut him off. "Wait, let 
me finish. I can go ahead on that 
basis, but as far as I'm concerned 
I might just as well be counting 
the angels on the head of a pin. 
You've got to give me more information, Secundus. I want to 
know who you are, and who 
Primus is, and whether there's 
any other being with whom 
Primus could possibly have a 
filial relationship. And if you 
can't tell me all that without giving me the Secret of the Universe, then you'd better give it to 




me whether it's good for me or 
not. I can't work in the dark." 

Secundus pursed his lips. 
"There is justice in what you say, 
Dpctor. Very well, I shall be entirely frank 'with you — in so far, 
as it is possible for me to do so, 
of course. Let's see, where can 
I -begin?" 

"First question," retorted Herman. "Who are you?" 

"We are — " Secundus thought 
a moment, then spread his hands 
with a helpless smile. "There are 
no words, Doctor. To put the case 
in negatives, we are not evolved 
organisms, we are not mortal, 
we are not, speaking in the usual 
sense, alive, although, of course — 
I hope you will not be offended — 
neither are you." 

Herman's brow wrinkled. "Are 
you real?" he demanded finally. 

Secundus looked embarrassed. 
"You have found me out, Dr. 
Raye. I endeavored to give you 
that impression — through vanity, 
I am ashamed to say — but, unhappily, it is not true. I, too, belong to the realm of noumena." 

"Then, blast it all, what is 
real? This planet isn't. You're 
not. What's it all for?" He paused 
a moment reflectively. "We're getting on to my second question, 
about Primus's attitude toward 
his 'father.' Perhaps I should have 
asked just now, 'Who is real?' 
Who remembers you, Secundus?" 

"This question, unfortunately. 



FREUDIAN SLIP 121 



is the one I cannot answer with 
complete frankness, Doctor. I 
assure you that it is not because 
I do not wish to; I have no option 
in the matter. I can tell you only 
that there is a Person of whom 
it might be said that He stands 
in the parental relationship to 
Primus, to me, and all the rest 
of our order." 

"God?" Herman inquired. "Jahweh? Allah?" 

"Please, no names, Doctor.** 
Eecundus looked apprehensive. 

"Then, damn it, tell me the 
rest!" Herman realized vaguely 
that he was soothing his own hurt 
vanity at Secundus's expense, but 
he was enjoying himself too much 
to stop. "You're afraid of something; that's been obvious right 
along. And there must be a time 
limit on it, or you wouldn't be 
rushing me. Why? Are you afraid 
that if this unnamable Person 
finds out you've botched your 
job, He'll wipe you out of existence and start over with a new 
bunch?" 

A cold wind blew down Herman's back. "Not us alone, Dr. 
Kaye," said Secundus gravely. "If 
the Inspector discovers this blunder — and the time is coming soon 
when He must — no corrections 
will be attempted. When a mistake occurs, it is — painted out." 

"Oh," aaid Herman after a 
moment. He sat down again, 
weakly. "How long have we got?" 



"Approximately one and a 
quarter days have gone by at the 
Earth's normal rate since Primus 
lost his memory," Secundus said. 
"I have not been able to 'speed 
you up,' as you termed it, by more 
than a twenty-to-one ratio. The 
deadline will have arrived, by my 
calculation, in fifteen minutes of 
normal time, or five hours at 
your present accelerated rate." 

Primus stepped into the room, 
crossed to the couch and lay 
down placidly. Secundus turned 
to go, then paused. 

"As for your final question, 
Doctor— you might think of the 
Universe as a Pointillist painting, in which this planet is one 
infinitesimally small dot of color. 
The work is wholly imaginary, of 
course, since neither the canvas 
nor the pigment has what you 
would term an independent existence. Nevertheless, the artist 
takes it seriously. He would not 
care to find, so to speak, mustaches daubed on it." 

Herman sat limply, staring 
after him as he moved to the 
door. Secundus turned once more. 

"I hope you will not think that 
I am displeased with you, Doctor," he said. "On the contrary, 
I feel that you arc accomplishing more than anyone else has. 
However, should you succeed, as 
I devoutly hope, there may not 
be sufficient time to congratulate 
you as you deserve. I shall have 



m 




 



to replace you . immediately in 
your normal world-line, for your 
absence would constitute as noticeable a flaw as that of the 
planet. In that event, my present 
thanks and congratulations will 
have to serve." 

With a friendly smile, he disappeared. 

Herman wound his watch. 

Two hours later. Primus's answers to his questions began to 
show a touch of resentment and 
surly defiance. Transference, Herman thought, with a constriction 
of his throat, and kept working 
desperately. ) 

Three hours. "What does the 
bolster remind you of?" 

"I seem to see a big cylinder 
rolling through space, sweeping 
the stars out of its way ..." 

Four hours. Only three minutes 
left now, in the normal world. 
/ can't wait to get any deeper, 
Herman thought. It's got to be 
now or never. 

"You must understand that 
these feelings of resentment and 
hatred are normal," he said, trying to keep the strain out of his 
voice, "but, at the same time, you 
have out grow n them — you can 
rise above them now. You are an 
individual in your own right, 
Primus. You have a job to do that 
only you can fill, and it's an important job. That's what matters, 
not all this infantile emotional 
clutter . . . *' 



He talked on, not daring to 
look at his watch. 

Primus looked up, and a huge 
smile broke over his face. He began, "Why, of — " 

TJERMAN found himself walking along Forty-second 
Street, heading toward the Hudson. The pavement was solid under his feet; the canyon betv/een 
the buildings was filled with the 
soft violet-orange glow of a summer evening in New York. In the 
eyes of the people he passed, he 
saw the same incredulous relief 
he felt. It was over. He'd done 
it. 

He'd broken all the rules, but, 
incredibly, he'd got results. 

Then he looked up and a chill 
spread over him. No one who 
knew the city would accept 
th*at ithyphallic parody as the 
Empire State Building, or those 
huge fleshy curves, as wanton as 
the mountains in which Mr. 
Maugham's "Sadie Thompson** 
had her lusty existence, as the 
prosaic hills' of New Jersey. 

Psychoanalysis had certainly 
removed Mr. Primus's inhibitions. 
The world was like a fence 
scrawled on by a naughty little 
boy. Mr. Primus would outgrow 
it in time, but life until then 
might be somewhat disconcerting. 

Those two clouds, for instance ...

THE subtitle of this volume is 
its own book review; "Tales 
Unlike Other Tales." 
They are! 

Most science fiction addicts 
know John Collier only through 
his famous "Green Thoughts," 
which appeared in the first science fiction anthology ever compiled, Donald Wollheim's Pocket 
Book ci Science Fiction. "Green 



Thoughts" isn't science fiction, 
for John Collier never wrote any 
in his life. It happens, however, 
that he is the most distinguished 
living writer of imaginative, fantastical, demonological, shivery 
and sophisticated.-supernatural 
stories, and any science fiction 
reader who foregoes this book has 
only himself to blame for having 
passed up one of the great reading experiences of modern times. 

Don't miss Collier! You'll be a 
much more watery and uninspired individual than you are, 
if you do.

BEYOND THE END OF 
TIME, edited by Frederik Pohl. 
Permabooks (Doubleday & Co., 
Inc.), New York, 1952. 407 pages, 
35c 

NINETEEN stories, all but 
four never anthologized before ; for 35 cents the buy of the 
month. All but three of the stories 
rate "B" or better, too; and it 
contains one nearly great (and 
quite unknown) tale, as well. This 
is called "Scanners Live in Vain," 
and it is written by some pseudonymity known as Cordwainer 
Smith. It is one of the best tours 
de force in science fiction. 

Another really magnificent tale 
is Fowler Wright's quietly irreversible comment on irresponsible science, called "Obvious 
Suicide.** 

There are also top -grade tales 
by Kornbluth, MacDonald, Leinster (he never fails!), Wyndham 
(alias both Harris and Beynon), 
MacCreigh, Finney (wonderful!), 
Bradbury (of course), Pearson, 
Clarke, Dryfoos, van Vogt, Gold 
(a delight!), Merril, and a completely surprising tale by Heinlein in collaboration with a lady 
named Wentz. 

A rich, juicy collection; Mr. 
Pohl is to be congratulated on 
having done it. Too bad he had 
to include these previously anthologized items: Pearson's "The 
Embassy," Bradbury's "There 



Will Come Soft Rains," van 
Vogt's "Letter from the Stars" 
(called "Dear Pen Pal" in its 
earlier book appearance), and 
Clarke's "Rescue Party." But 
even with these duplications, this 
is an unavoidable "must," particularly at the price.

"IVTINE stories by a gent who is

"humorists" in science fiction 
whose humor — at least most of 
it — is funny rather than plain 
silly. 

Previously collected: "Knock*

"Crisis, 1999" (I didn't much like 
this mixture of science fiction, 
sleuthing and pseudo-hypnotism; 
C-plus) ; "Pi in the Sky" (a genuinely brilliant, slap-happy satire

—and best, for my money — 
"Come and Go Mad" (one of 
the most superb "we're property**

padlocked shelves so people won*t

fTVHIS anthology has, as the 
saying has a way of going, 
everything — including 14 stories, 
of which nine according to my 
coiJ*it are worth preserving. 

There's a pleasant introduction 
by Willy Ley; a 13-page "Dictionary of Science Fiction" that 
contains about 75 definitions (to 
pun slightly, definitely not a 
definitive dictionary) ; and a 16page full-color section of BEMS 
(though Mr. G. insists they're 
not any such thing) by Carrier. 

In other words, PublisherEditor Grecnberg has given us a 
really portentous volume here, 
full of miscellaneous apparati and 
wlkammies. The stories I like and 
think you will include : Keith 
Bennett's "The Rocketeers Have 
Shaggy Ears" (Venus adven-* 
ture) ; Christopher Youd* i 
"Christmas Tree" (good Mooo 



tale); Ray Bradbury's completely out of place "The Shape 
of Things" (it deals with a baby 
that was born "through" the 
wrong dimension and looked like 
a blue pyramid — a superb story 
having nothing to do with space 
travel) ; Lyle Monroe's "Columbus Was a Dope" (Moon; this 
delightful snapper of a story is 
actually a double -snapper, as you 
will learn when you trace its actual author's name on the copyright page; to give you a clue, 
the initials are R. A. H.); Hal 
Clement's "Attitude" (about a 
planet of S Doradus, very circumstantial, as if Mr. C. had 
really been there) ; William 
Term's very pleasant but routine 
"Ionian Cycle" (all about weird 
life); Robertson Osborne's "Action on Azura" (splendid!— but 
already anthologized under the 
title of "Contact, Inc."); A. E. 
van Vogt's "The Rull," (it will 
drive you nuts; very sticky — and 
very unforgettable — indeed) ; and 
Poul Anderson's A-plus-plus 
"The Double Dyed Villians," 
(about the Galactic government 
that keeps the peace solely 
through corruption — and justly 
so, too). 

The other five tales you may 
like. Buy the book and find out! 
I didn't, but then I'm a soft of 
narrow-minded, combative cove,

IN YHE VOID 



By POUl ANDERSON 

An airless, waterless asteroid covered with 



flourishing green plants? Impossible! Still 
there H was— tended by the oddest curator/ 



Illustrated by HUSH 



"A 



i N asteroid. A gteen aatcroid." 

His voice oddly resonant in the metal stillness of the 
spaceship, he looked through the 
forward port with an uncertain 
wonder in him. 

There was darkness outside, the 
great hollow night of space, and 
a thousand stars flamed cold in 
the brass frame of the port. The 



asteroid showed as a tiny palegreen spark that only a trained 
eye would have seen among those 
■warming bitter-bright suns. The 
quality of it was different, a 
muted reflection of the Belt's 
weak light instead of naked fire 
leaping across a universe, and it 
flickered a little as the irregular 
stone spun on its axis. 

"Green," said Hardesty again. 



• ARDEN IN THE VOID 



the note of puzzlement grown 
stronger. "I never saw that before." 

His wife shoved off from one 
wall of the cabin, her tall form 
weightlessly drifting past the glitter of control board to the instruments mounted on the. farther 
side. 

"Shall we have a look?" she 
asked practically. 

Hardesty glanced at the meters 
and performed a mental calculation ; one had to be sparing of fuel 
on a voyage like this. 

"Yes, if the velocity isn*t toe 
different from ours," he said. 

Marian's dark head bent over 
the telescope and her long, strong 
fingers spun a wheel, sighting ofl 
th? speck that flirted out among 
the constellations. There was a 
faint sighing of gears above the 
murmur of air blown through a 
ventilator. It was quiet out if» 
space — so quiet. Hardesty's pulse 
was loud in his own ears. 

He undipped a pencil from =» 
pocket of his coverall and scribbled the figures she announced 
on a pad clamped to the contrcl 
board. When her readings were 
done, he took the slide rule frota 
its rack and manipulated it witti 
the easy speed of long practice 
His gaunt frame hung in mid-air, 
one foot hooked through the arm 
of a recoil chair to keep him in 
place. 

The Gold Rush was moving 



outward from the Sun with - a 
velocity known closely enough 
from his last astrogational readings. It was a fair approximation 
tc assume that the asteroid's motion was at forty-five degrees to 
the ship's path and its speed that 
to be expected of a body orbiting 
at this distance. Thus, from the 
observed transverse angular velocity, the separation could be 
estimated. It would take so much 
fuel to kill the ship's outward 
vector — a deceleration of twopoint-five Gs should do it in the 
allowed distance — and then you 
added ten per cent for maneuvering and landing. 

"Uh-huh," he nodded. "It's all 
right, honey." 

Marian swam into her chair, 
adjusted the webbing, and 
plugged in her throat mike. She'd 
be taking the reading while Hardesty piloted the ship, but you 
needed a comcircuit to talk and 
hear when the rockets were going. 

His mind quit gnawing at the 
problem of a green asteroid and 
concentrated on the delicate job 
of working the ship in. Slowly, 
his whickering gyros swung the 
hull around. When the rockets 
started to roar, it was a thunder 
voice booming and crashing between the vibrant walls, shivering 
the teeth in his skull, and weight 
dragged cruelly at a body grown 
used to free fall. For a moment 



■a 1* 




 



his eyes hazed, the constellations 
danced insanely through a suddenly reddened sky, and then his 
trained reflexes took over and he 
watched the asteroid swelling in 
the rearview telescreen. 

They shot past it at a distance 
of ten miles, splashing the great 
dark with livid flame. Now it 
rolled in the forward port, and 
he notched the main switch 
ehead and felt his tissues groaning. Marian snapped out a string 
of instrument readings, and gyros 
whined as Hardesty brought the 
•hip about, changing course, bearing down on the rock. They swung 
past it in a long curve. When it 
was centered on the cross-hairs 
of the rearview screen and could 
be held there, Hardesty backed 
down upon it. 

A typical piece of space debris, 
he thought. It was roughly cylindrical, perhaps ten miles long and 
five thick, but the crags and 
gashes that scarred its surfaces 
made it a jumble of blackened 
stone. Here and there a patch of 
quartz or mica caught the thin 
sunlight in a swiftly harsh blink. 
The greenness was in patches, 
clustered on such hills and slopes 
as offered most Sun, but there 
seemed to be a delicate webbing 
—of veins?— connecting all those 
bunches. There were brown and 
gray and yellow mixed in. Like 
lichen, he decided, and his mind 
hearkened back to the cool, mossy 



rocks of a New England forest 
and suddenly, almost bitterly, he 
wished he were there. 

The radar screen flickered and 
danced. Not much level ground, 
but he had landed on worse places 
without toppling his ship. Even 
if he did fail now, it would mean 
only the nuisance of rigging the 
derrick to lift her — a bump in 
that feeble gravity couldn't hurt 
vessel or crew. 

A motor sang above the dull 
thutter of rockets and the landing 
tripod slid out around the tubes. 
Electronic valves glowed, radarcontrolled servos adjusting the 
lengths of the three legs to 
the sloping, pitted surface. In 
the sudden ringing stillness, as the 
rockets went dead, the hull 
boomed and sagged. Shale gave 
way beneath one leg, but the 
■ervo lengthened it till its foot 
rested on solidity, and then the 
whole ship was quiet. 

Hardesty shook his head to 
clear it and looked across at his 
wife. Her thinly strong features 
smiled back at him, congratulating him, but no words were 
needed; they knew each other too 
well. He unbuckled the webbing 
and stood erect. 

THE vision of the sky was like 
a blow in the face when they 
stepped out. He could spend 
a hundred years in the Belt, 
thought Hardesty, and its eerie

unhuman magnificence would be 
as cold in his heart as the first 
day he left Earth. 

The Gold Rush was not a large 
spaceship — a two-passenger Beltboat with extraction and refining 
equipment, fuel and supplies 
enough for a year of cruising — ■ 
but she loomed over their heads, 
a squat metal tower against the 
stars, dully ashine in the pale, 
chill light. Before them, a harsh 
raggedness of knife-edged rock 
swept to a horizon that seemed 
near enough to touch, the edge of 
forever lying beyond that wolfjawed rim of hills. The ground 
was black, pits and craters and 
twisted frozen magma, dully lit, 
shadows like holes of blindness 
creeping over the rough slope. A 
tiny Sun, three hundred million 
miles away, glittered and threw 
a wash of dim, heatless luminance. 

It was quiet, the blank quiet 
of airlessness and emptiness, the 
only noise that of the muted 
scrunch of footsteps carried 
through the spacesuits, only that 
and the hot. rapid thud of heart 
and breath. The sound of his own 
life was almost deafening in Hardesty's skull, and yet it was the 
dimmest flicker in a room of 
night, a tiny frantic fist beating 
on iron gates of silence. 

And overhead wheeled the 
stars, the million suns of space, 
fire and ice and the giant sprawl 



of constellations, the Milky Way 
a rush of curdled silver, the far, 
mysterious glow of nebulae, hugeness and loneliness to break a 
human heart. There went the 
Great Bear, swinging light-years 
overhead, and it was not the 
friendly neighbor of Earth's 
heaven, but a god striding in 
flame and darkness, scorning the 
watchers, enormous and beautiful 
and cruel. The others followed, 
and the stars that Earth never 
sees threw their signals flashing 
and flashing across the years and 
the unthinkable distances, and 
no man knew what they were 
calling. 

Hardesty drew a deep breath 
and looked over to Marian. The 
declining Sun flared off her space 
armor; a sheen on the helmet 
veiled her face from him. The 
armor depersonalized her and the 
voice over the radio was a metallic rattle. It was as if a robot 
stood at his side. 

He threw off the oppression of 
solitude and forced a calm into 
his voice: "Come on. let's take a 
look at one of those green patches 
before sunset." 

"I think there's one over that 
way." She pointed north with a 
gauntleted hand. 

Hardesty had already located 
the asteroid's pole star. He noted 
the position of the other constellations and set off after her. Ten 
years' experience had taught him 



ISO 



GALAXY SCIENCS FICTION 



how easy it was to get lost in 
such a jungle of stone, and their 
tanks only held air for a few 
hours. 

It was ghostly, bounding along 
in utter s^Jence, almost weightless, between the high, dead crags 
and under the sharp stars. In all 
his time out here, Hardesty had 
not lost the eeriness of it. And 
yet Earth was blurring in his 
memory, green fields and tall 
trees and the feel of an actual 
wind, a low old house among a 
thousand shouting autumn colors, 
beat of wings across heaven — he 
couldn't always conjure up the 
images. A blaze of naked stars 
would rise between. 

Well, maybe here, maybe some-? 
where else, this trip or next, we'll 
make the big strike. Then we'll 
go home. 

It was the great chimera. For 
every man who reached it, a hundred broke their hearts or left 
their withered corpses on some 
unknown frozen rock. 

Hardesty had been one of the 
luckiest. He'd made enough once 
to buy his own ship, and since 
that time enough to pay his costs 
and even save a little money. And 
he'd met one of the Belt's few 
wox^n in an office on Ceres, and 
married her and made her his 
partner. 

How would Marian look at 
Earth? She'd never seen it. She'd 
been born on Mars. 



The Sun sloped low as the asteroid spun on its hurried, timeless way. Wan light glimmered 
off Marian's armor as she topped 
a high ridge, pinning her against 
darkness and the scornful stars. 
Her voice was a sudden excited 
gasp in his earphones: 

"Jim! Jim, come quick!" 

He bunched his muscles and 
reached her side in a soaring 
bound, floating down and twirling 
a little like a dead autumn leaf. 
(Autumn, a maple scarlet against 
October smoke, and a leaf scrirtling across the sidewalk.') Together they looked down the 
crazily tilted sheet of basalt to 
the seamed ledge jutting out 
against Orion. 

The green was there. In the 
airlessness, it was as sharp and 
clear as if it touched his helmet. 
Leathery domes, coiling vines, 
thick strong leaves — 

He breathed the word as if it 
were something holy: "Life." 

"Life? But it's not possible, 
Jim. No asteroid has life." 

His answer was flat, and a sudden coldness tingled in his hands. 
"This one does." 

HE strode across the black 
slabs in the seven-league 
boots of Belt gravity. The Sun 
hung between two pinnacles, 
throwing a horned shadow across 
the acre of green. Hardesty knelt 
at the boundary of the patch' and 



GARDEN IN THE VOID 



grasped one of the cactuslike 
leaves. 

It seemed almost to shrink, and 
in the vague tricky light he 
thought that a pulse ran from it, 
through the webbing of vines, and 
out of sight along the filaments 
that reached from this ledge. He 
drew back his hand and squatted 
there, staring. Marian came up 
and stood against his side. 

"I — " Her voice was low now, 
trembling faintly. **I don't know 
whether to — to be glad or interested or — frightened, Jim." 

His long-jawed face slid into 
the expressionlessness of uncertainty. "I know. We've gotten so 
used to thinking of the Belt as 
inorganic that — well, our enemies 



have been cold and vacuum and 
distance, impersonal forces. We 
really don't know how to face « 
something that could be actively 
hostile. And yet, that life could 
exist and evolve here is a wonderful feeling." He looked up to the 
stars as if throwing them a challenge. 

"This can't hurt us. Plants. 
You don't think there could be 
—-monsters here?" 

"I wouldn't mind a good hotbreathed dragon. But germs? I 
suppose I'm being an old woman. 
But you know what they say 
about bold spacemen never becoming old spacemen. They don't 
live that long." 

"How can any life exist here? 



GALAXY SCIENC1 HCTIOM 



No water, no air, nothing — " 
"I don't know. It's obviously 
not terrestrial- type life, though 
I'm pretty sure it's protoplasmic. 
It's adapted to these conditions, 
that's all." 

Decision brought him erect 
again. "I suppose we should try 
to study this out, make analyses 
and so on, but we have neither 
the training nor the equipment to 
do so. We'll take some pictures, 
and get an accurate orbit for this 
pebble, and report the whole matter to Ceres. And we'll scout 
around for minerals as usual, 
avoiding these green patches. Our 
work is risky enough without taking even a tiny extra chance." 
"You're righj:." Marian stood 




GARDEN IN THE VOID 




looking at the plants. They were 
small and grotesquely ugly, but— 
"A garden," she whispered. "A 
little garden, blooming out here 
on the edge of nothing." 

"Come on," said Hardesty. 
"Let's get back to the ship." 

rwiHE Sun sank under the farther 
■* rocks and night was abruptly 
on them. Their flashlights cast 
dull puddles of yellow haze on 
the ground, where elsewhere 
there was a sea of black under 
the streaming stars. The sky's 
light picked out the higher crags, 
etching them frost-gray against 
the dark, but the humans stumbled in shadow, floating to the 
ground to continue their careful 
low-gravity shuffle back toward 
the ship. 

"I can't forget it," said Marian. 
"Those plants, blooming out here 
without air or heat or water — do 
you think that comets hover 
above them, Jim? Do you think 
their pollen is Stardust?" 

"Don't get poetic," he grunted. 

In spite of their stellar observations, they had trouble locating the ship, approaching it 
finally from the other side. Thus 
they had walked around the massive tripod before they saw the 
figure waiting in front of the 
gangway. 

Hardesty thought with a flash 
of disappointment., that some 
other prospector had beaten them

to it. He had come far out of 
the usual lanes, without revealing 
his course to anyone, to avoid 
just that; matching velocities and 
landing was so expensive that, by 
law, the first man to set down on 
a new rock held alt mining rights. 
.Then, as he looked closer — 

The space armor was awkward 
and bulky, a model which had 
been obsolete long before Hardesty left Earth, and its metal 
was patched and battered. There 
was no air-tank. A thick-leafed 
vine coiled around the square oldfashioned helmet, across the 
shoulders and down the back, 
like ivy on an ancient university 
building. Hardesty saw with a 
jolting shock that a tendril ran 
into the helmet, sealed by a 
clutnsy weld, and that tiny rootlets veined the face inside and 
was tangled in among the man'i 
beard. 

The — man? 

Marian's stifled scream was 
loud in his earphones ; she 
clutched at Hardesty's arm and 
they skipped back together. A 
dead man, a corpse, a revenant 
puppet of plants which grew 
where no life could be — 

"Who are you? What are you?" 

The other took a floating stride 
toward them. His face was hooded 
in darkness; they could barely 
see the glitter of starlight in his 
sunken eyes. Hardesty stood 
waiting, braced to meet the thine 



that neared him. The ship behind seemed infinitely remote. 

Metal hands clasped Hardesty's shoulders and the square 
helmet leaned forward to ring 
faintly against his own. That 
close, the miner could see the 
shaggy head inside, still veiled 
with shadow — a shattered gravestone of a face with ivy creeping 
over it and reaching into the 
cracks. He fought down an impulse to retch. 

The voice that came was dim 
and slow: "You— from Earth?" 

"Yes and no. Who are you, 
man? What is that you're wearing?" Hardesty's mouth was dry. 

"My name? It's — I am the 
gardener." The stranger shook his 
big head, and the cactus leaves 
on his helmet rustled where there 
was never a wind to stir them, 
"No, wait. Yes, they called me, 
my name, yes . . . Hans Gronauer," A throbbing chuckle. "But 
that was long ago. Now I am the 
gardener. " 

"You mean you were shipwrecked?" 

"Yes. How long ago? There are 
not years here. I think it was 
twenty Earth years ago. That is 
a guess. It could be more." The 
newcomer brushed a gauntleted 
hand over his faceplate, a 
strangely human gesture, as if he 
were trying to rub his weary eyes. 
"You will excuse. It is long since 
I talked. And my — my talker?—

Yes, radio. My radio was broken 
in the crash. I must talk this 
way." 

"By helmet conduction? Yeah, 
sure. But — my God, man! That 
plant growing — growing on you 
like that — " 

The tiny gleam of teeth in the 
beard, the downcast eyes, it was a 
shy smile. "The plant gives air. 
So." 

"So — oh!" Marian had heard 
the words over her husband's set. 
"Jim, of course, the plants release oxygen and he's used them 
— Twenty years, Jim!" 

Turning his face, he saw the 
cold starlight gleam on her tearstreaked cheeks, and there was 
a sudden wrench of pity in his 
own heart. 

Twenty years! Twenty years 
alone in naked space! 

"Come into the ship," he said 
urgently. He .didn't think he could 
stand out here on twisted black 
stone with a million frozen suns 
jeering at him. "Come into the 
ship, man, and get some food. 
Twenty years! My God!" 

"No." Gronauer didn't shake 
his head, for that human gesture 
seemed forgotten, but he lowered 
his eyes. "No. Not yet, please." 

"But—" 

"The garden would not like it. 
Not yet." 

"The garden?" 

"World. We — don't dare. Not 
till we know. It has been so long." 



"I think I see." It was Marian 
again ; Hardesty had never 
stopped wondering at the cool 
quickness of her mind. She wasn't 
pretty, he supposed, but even on 
Earth he couldn't have had a 
better wife. "He's adapted in 
some odd way, or thinks he may 
have. He's not sure he can stand 
conditions inside our ship." 

"Yes. The plant might die." 
Gronauer's faded voice held a 
sudden eagerness. His vocabulary 
was coming back to him in a rush. 
"} must think this out. Come with 
me and let us investigate the 
problem." 

"Come where?" 

"My home. It is safe for you. 
But — yes, bring food." 

"You haven't eaten?" 

"The garden feeds me. But for 
you it may not be safe — be safe 
for you yet. Come quick. Pleased 

"All right, if it isn't far. 
We have to watch our air supply, 
you know." 

"The plants give air." 

At the thought of tendrils 
around his head and roots going 
into him, Hardesty shivered. 
"No!" 

"I mean air is in my house. 
You can breathe there. It is not 
far from here." 

"Very well." Hardesty disengaged himself from Gronauer and 
fhus from auditory contact. 
"Marian, fetch some canned 
stuff. And put my gun into a 



GARDEN IN THI VOID 



m 



pocket. It's in the toolbox." 
"Gun, Jim?" 

"Yeah." His voice was a little 
ragged. "Never thought I'd need 
it, but let's not take chances. I'm 
not leaving you alone with him, 
cither. I'm pretty sure he's harmless, but you can't tell. Twenty 
years! He's not acting like a normal human being. But who the 
hell would after living here like 
that for so long? Yes, I want the 
gun." 

Wordlessly, she stepped up the 
gangway and disappeared into 
the airlock. Gronauer stood waiting, making no further attempt at 
conversation, and Hardesty wu 
•atisficd to keep it that way. 

The wonder of his discovery 
was lost in worried calculation. 
They could certainly not refuse 
to take Gronauer with them when 
they left, but his extra mass and 
the supplies he would need could 
upset the whole cruise. There 
wasn't any outpost to take hire 
to within some scores of megamiles. So unless a decent lode of 
fissionable ores was found soon, 
he represented a heavy financial 
loss. Briefly. Hardesty wondered 
if he could leave Gronauer to be 
picked up by a government rescue 
ship. After all, scientists would 
want to investigate this place . . . 
But it'd make Hardesty an outcast, being known to have abandoned a shipwrecked spaceman. 
And he'd have to live with him


self. No, he'd have to take Gronauer back, whatever it cost. 

All he could do was hope that 
there was a lode on this asteroid. 
Gronauer would know about that . 

Marian came back, loaded with 
a sack of cans which Hardesty 
slung over one shoulder. Gronauer set off at once. 

The path was dark, there under the ghostly arch of the Milky 
Way, but he picked his way with 
effortless speed. It didn't seem to 
occur to him that the others were 
having trouble keeping up. Hardesty cursed and stumbled. He 
noticed that there was a leathery 
bladder on the castaway's back, 
apparently part of the vine system. It glowed with the dimmest 
of red light. Heat? 

After a mile or two of bare 
stone, they entered a patch of 
growth that seemed to stretch indefinitely far on every side. The 
frailer vines and leaves shrank 
aside from the human feet, and 
subliminally faint pulses rippled 
through the garden and over the 
edge of the little world. Hardesty 
estimated that they came, in all, 
some five miles from the Gold 
Rush before reaching the other 
spaceship. 

It was a smashed ruin. Only 
the central part of the hull seemed 
intact, and that had been patched 
and welded. It lay in a small box 
canyon, against the low bluff at 
the farther end. The metal ribs 



GARDEN IN THE VOID 



117 



and the great broken tubes were 
scattered around it like ravenpicked bones. And everywhere 
the steel was- covered by green 
growth. 

Here the plants had become a 
thicket, vines swarming over the 
cliffs and wrapped about the 
gaunt crags, leaves and tendrils 
and looming fluted columns hiding the rock in a ghost-gray sea, 
stirring without wind and rustling 
without sound under the chill 
stars. Gronauer's cabin was 
smothered *in the dripping life. 
Hardesty could not suppress a 
shudder as the leaves framing the 
airlock brushed him. 

Within the chamber there was 
a stifling darkness until Gronauer 
opened the inner door, and then 
feeble light shone. It was lost 
again as frost condensed on the 
space-chilled helmets. Hardesty 
and Marian helped each other 
out of their armor, careful not to 
touch it with bare hands, and 
followed Gronauer into the room 
beyond. 

The miner's first glance was 
for the castaway, now that he had 
removed his ivy-covered, battered 
old armor. His hair and beard 
were streaked with gray, and he 
smelled unwashed, though there 
was no grime- on him. It was the 
face that held Hardesty's gaze, 
the cruelly smashed face which 
had healed into lumps of scar 
tissue. It was pockmarked oo 



cheeks and forehead, where he 
had gently pulled out the roots 
of the plant that still clung to his 
spacesuit. But the eyes were 
gentle, the mutilated lips curved 
in a timid smile, and he stood 
aside for his guests. 

The cabin was small, almost 
unfurnished, yet crowded- It was 
cold and the air had a musty 
reek. Plants covered walls and 
ceiling, made a springy carpeting 
underfoot, rustled and skivered 
as the humans walked across 
them. There were a lot of the 
red bladders twined into the 
leafage, and light came from 
countless tiny — berries? — things 
which glowed a dull amber in 
the gray-green tangle. 

"It is strange to you, I suppose," said Gronauer apologetically. "But it keeps me alive." 

Hardesty touched a bladder. It 
was warm under his hand. Yes, 
the plants heated the room and 
aired it and illuminated it and 
fed the owner. He had a sudden 
dark wonder as to just who owned 
whom. 

"It's like a dream," whispered 
Marian. The unspoken thought 
ran on : A nightmare. A sufrealist's delirium. "Have you had 
this long, Mr. Gronauer?" 

"Yes. At first I ate the garden, 
but then I saw that, that way, 
one of us must kill the other., and 
if I killed it there would be no 
food for me. So I made friends 



•ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



instead, and bit by bit the garden learned my needs and gave 
them to me." 

As if exhausted by speech, Gronauer's rusty voice faded out and 
he answered no more questions. 
Hardesty repressed a revulsion. 
After all, this was a wonderful example of human ingenuity, the greatest Robinson Crusoe story in the universe, and 
certainty the plants were harmless. But he took out cans and 
can opener with the eagerness of 
a man clutching at familiarity in 
a strange land. 

"Shall we eat?" he suggested. 

Gronauer shook his head, smiling, when they offered him Bionate and one of their few,, 
cherished cans of beer. "I — have 
no taste for it," he said. "It might 
even be dangerous. I will feed." 

Carefully, he broke off one of 
the fleshy cactuslike leaves and 
chewed on it. He held a trailing 
vine to his face, and Marian 
looked away as the tendrils 
stirred hungrily and slid into the 
pocks. At least, thought Hardesty 
a little sickly, the plants did 
everything for him. Everything 
except furnish human companionship — and it didn't seem as if 
Gronauer needed that any more. 

Not after twenty years. 

IT was surprising how much 
difference a full stomach made. 
Hardesty hadn't really been 



aware of his own hunger till it 
was gone and strength was flowing back into his bloodstream. He 
sat down almost casually on a 
vine-begrown chair — there was a 
mossy plant intertwined, making 
a faintly warm cushion — and began to draw Gronauer out in talk. 
That wasn't easy; the castaway 
was too shy to do more than 
mumble answers while staring at 
his feet, but piece by piece the 
Story was revealed. It was, in 
reality, quite simple. 

Gronauer had been only twenty 
or so when he left his native 
Germany for the Asteroid Belt. 
That was thirty years ago, when 
the mineral riches of the flying 
mountains had just lately come 
to the attention of an Earth increasingly starved for fissionable 
ores, and the great companies 
were outfitting expeditions. A 
ship which cruised among the 
scattered worldlets, refining the 
substances it located, could return in a year or two to one of 
the asteroid cities with a cargo 
worth a good many millions of 
dollars. 

Hard, dangerous, and profitable work has always commanded 
high wages, and no few of the 
prospectors, Gronauer among 
them, had soon been able to buy 
their own ships and go out as 
independent operators. 

He'd had a partner — he 
couldn't remember the -man's 



GARDEN IN THI VOID 



13* 



name now — and they'd traveled 
and dug together for about five 
years. As the most accessible asteroids became worked out, the 
custom of not revealing one's destination grew up. That way, if 
you found a rich group of planetoids, you could make several 
trips without competition — but, 
of course, if you met with an accident there could be no rescue. 
Without more powerful radio 
equipment than a Beltboat could 
carry, there was no way to get 
help. 

Gronauer had gone north of the 
ecliptic plane, looking for one of 
the many groups which traveled 
in crazily tilted orbits. He'd 
found this green world and come 
wo^deringly in for a landing. But 
the asteroid had a satellite, a 
meteor which had suddenly 
flashed over the horizon and 
crashed through the ship's engines and sent it hurtling to its 
death. 

The other man was killed. 
Gronauer had escaped with broken bones and a smashed face. 
He'd lain near extinction for a 
timeless age; only the fact that 
the weak gravity made no demands on his body had saved 
him. After that, the only thing 
to do was to survive somehow 
and hope that another prospector 
would happen by. That could be 
within a year or never. It was 
safest to assume that he would 



leave his bones here. 

One man could live off the 
ship's food stores perhaps two 
years. But there was life, the 
plants, food. Gronauer had had 
no means of testing for poison except his own metabolism. A few 
times he got sick but he learned 
what he could safely eat. Certain 
of the fleshy cactus growths were 
nourishing. 

He harvested all of them within 
five miles or so of his ship. After 
a few days — or weeks, or months ; 
he lost track — he'd gone out after 
more, and found that everything 
was dead in the area which he 
had exploited. And when he cut 
some plants elsewhere and ate 
■them, he nearly died again. 

i"» RONAUER was no biologist, 
but a spaceman generally 
picked up a good knowledge of 
science and so he had heard of 
symbiosis. It was clear that the 
plants were in some way interdependent, that each species was 
necessary to the survival of the 
whole. And in some dim way they 
had sensed the enemy among 
them and reacted with deadly 
swiftness.. Any type he tried to eat 
would soon become poisonous to 
him. Perhaps the garden would 
try something still more devastating. An unnoticed root, growing 
between two plates of the 
wrecked ship that housed him, 
could split it open and let out 



140 




 



the air in a great and fatal rush. 

With a quiet, methodical 
courage th a t Ha rdesty had to 
admire, he had given himself the 
urgent job of studying the symbiosis. He had no formal education in biology and almost no 
scientific instruments; most of his 
conclusions were guesswork from 
the sketchiest data. But given a 
year or two of patient slogging, 
and a good mind driven by a 
peasant's deep, strong will to live, 
one could accomplish more than 
Earth's cold intellectuals would 
ever admit. 

He puzzled it out, observing 
and thinking in the huge loneliness of his world. The life here 
was protoplasmic, chemically 
similar to his own. It even seemed 
to involve photosynthesis of some 
kind. 

The tough skin of the "cactoids" admitted ultraviolet light 
— intense in airless space, even 
this far from the Sun — while preventing the loss of water by 
evaporation. Instead, the water 
circulated through vine-systems to 
other species that used it in their 
own life -processes, and carried 
organic compounds manufactured 
by various types of plants to 
the symbiotic whole. The water 
was obtained from gypsum and 
other minerals by certain roots 
which added alcohol to prevent 
its freezing. Even so, the bitter 
temperatures would long affo> 



have turned it to ice, except that 
it circulated through the red 
bladders and these heated it with 
energy derived from fermentation 
or very slow combustion. The 
oxygen for that could also be 
cracked from mineral compounds 
beneath the surface. 

Cross-fertilization and the subsequent spread of life over the 
whole asteroid depended on specialized vines. There even seemed 
to be hearts for this vascular system, slowly pulsing lumps of 
tissue scattered through the garden. A vast and unimaginably 
intricate network, each type fulfilling one of the many functions 
needed to maintain the whole in 
existence — 

A trained biologist might well 
have needed as much time as 
Gronauer to puzzle out the life 
cycle. 

"I still wonder if solar energy 
is enough to keep such a system 
going," said Hardesty. "It takes 
a lot to break up minerals, you 
know, even if the symbiosis manufactures catalysts." 

"We are as far from the Sua 
as we ever get," answered Gronauer patiently. "The orbit m 
very — yes, very eccentric. I think 
the period is about seven years. 
At least we have three times 
come, I think, within the orbit 
of Venus while I was here. It gets 
hot then, special plants grow up 
to protect the others, and energy

is stored chemically against the 
long cold which follows." 

"I see. And with this highly 
tilted orbit, the asteroid hasn't 
been discovered even when it 
was that close to Earth." 

The poor guy! Think of him 
sitting here, watching the Sun 
grow and blaze, watching Earth 
swell to a blue brilliance and 
her moon visible beside her, and 
Btill alone, still forever alone. 

"How did life evolve here?" 
wondered Marian. "You need air 
and oceans for that, and this 
asteroid has been dead rock since 
the beginning of time." 

Hardesty shrugged . "We'll 
probably never know, but I can 
make a guess. On some other 
world, maybe the world of another* star, air and water disappeared slowly enough for life to 
adapt, Certain spores of that h^fe 
were lifted on the last wisps of 
atmosphere up to where light 
pressure could drive them from 
that solar system. The old Arrhenius theory. They survived the 
trip. There were a lot of sporeclumps landing on many worlds, 
but this might be the only one 
in our system that had the conditions they needed for growth. 
Maybe not — the spores could 
be the ancestors of all life on our 
planets, but I doubt it. Too completely alien." 

It was an eldritch thought, that 
the garden bad been seeded from 



across that gulf of space, that it 
was the child of a world millions 
of years in its grave, and that— 
perhaps, in the remote future, 
when all the planets were airless 
husks, gardens like this would 
bloom as the last defiance of the 
sunless night. He shivered in the 
chill must of the room. 

"Go on," he said. "Tell us what 
you did." 

Gronauer looked at him with 
gentle, frightened eyes. 

"Don't be shy," said Marian 
softly. "It is a great and wonderful thing you've done. You 
make me proud to be human." 

"Human?" The short laugh was 
jarring. A vague rustling went 
among the le a ves. "I am — h uxnan?" After a moment, looking 
away: "Please to excuse. I have 
not been used to talking so much. 
I will try." 

THE words stumbled out, awkward, toneless, the words of a 
man who had begun by speaking 
German, changed to the English 
of the spaceways, and then not 
spoken at all except for the 
shadowy half -language of the 
garden. Hardesty had to fill in 
gaps; the "Castaway could only 
bint at a reality too far from human experience for communication — but the outline grew. 

It had been plain that the symbiosis was highly adaptable. It 
probably had to be, to survive

the extremes of the asteroid's 
wildly swooping orbit. Gronauer 
thought, too. that the impact of 
cosmic rays, unshielded by atmosphere, induced a hugh mutation rate; somehow, the garden 
weeded out unfavorable mutations and took those it could use. 
The pattern was not a rigid thing. 
It was constantly evolving. 

There even seemed to be a 
primitive brain somewhere. Not 
a human-type brain — there probably wasn't a nervous system as 
Earth knew it — but something 
had to control that change. Something had altered the garden's 
metabolism and poisoned those 
leaves that the stranger ate. 

Probably it had tried various 
compounds from the beginning of 
Gronauer's attacks, until it hit on 
this one. The man had harvested 
the deadly leaves and disposed 
of them with a terrible feeling of 
being watched. But that was ridiculous — or was it? Was not the 
whole impossibly living world 
against him, ringing him in and 
waiting for him to die? 

After a few weeks he ate again, 
experimentally, and was not sick. 
He'd fooled the garden. Only it 
would keep on trying to kill him, 
and he would never know when 
it had made a successful attempt 
until too late. His one long-range 
chance of survival lay in making 
peace with the garden; and that 
could only be done by proving his 



potential usefulness to it. 

Digging around a patch of 
growth, he discovered that certain thick roots went deep into 
the hard rock. Those must be for 
extracting buried minerals. Protoplasm required carbon and oxygen, among other things, and 
most likely the source of the former element was the various carbonates. 

Gronauer went to an area 
where the plants had not yet penetrated and began to dig. His 
miner's eye and brain were more 
effective than the chance gropings of the blind roots, and it was 
slow work for them, forcing their 
way into solid rock. 

Before long, he had a small 
heap of assorted carbonates. He 
macerated them and laid them 
beside one of the big roots. A few 
hours later, tendrils had grown 
around his offering and most of 
it was being absorbed. Limestone 
was a favorite, he saw, while iron 
compounds were hardly touched. 
He went after more limestone. 
And there were other elements 
they must need — sulfates would 
be especially valuable — and with 
the tiny atomic heater that remained to him, he could concentrate nitrates. 

It took time for the garden to 
understand. There probably was 
no conscious mind reasoning out 
what Gronauer wanted; there was 
simply a high mutation rate and 



GARDEN IN THI VOID 



14* 



a completely integrated ecology. 
By supplying minerals, by loosening rock about new roots, by 
guiding tendrils in their direction 
of growth, the man performed a 
service, and the energy saved the 
whole system could go into proliferation — some of which would 
be new, "experimental" forms. 

WITHIN a few months, there 
were pale leaves which 
seemed to be mostly protein. 
Gronauer harvested and ate them. 
Presently there were no more such 
leaves. They had apparently not 
fulfilled a real function, and the 
symbiosis had cut them off. Gronauer stopped working for the 
garden. He waited, and the slow 
weeks passed, and his supplies 
from Earth got horribly short. If 
he had guessed wrong — 

No. The flesh-leaves budded 
out again. Gronauer rewarded the 
garden with a heap of limestone 
and copperas. Thereafter the 
leaves stayed. Whether it was 
blind natural selection within the 
framework of symbiosis, or 
whether there really was some 
dim brain capable of learned reflexes, the garden adapted to the 
new fact that flesh-leaves meant 
free minerals. 

"After that," said Gronauer 
simply, "we were friends. The 
problem was only to com — communicate our needs to each 
other." 



He needed green food to prevent scurvy. An experimental 
taste made him ill, and again he 
withheld his services. Thereafter 
the garden produced more edible 
green leaves than it needed for itself, and he gathered the surplus. 

It was to his advantage to have 
the garden change rapidly, so 
that new possibilities would arise. 
He rewarded each discovered mutation with an extra mineral ration; if it turned out to be useful, 
he was lavish in his payments. 
Thus, over the years, he attained 
a remarkably balanced diet. 

Meanwhile, the pi a nts had 
grown back around his ship, and 
he transplanted vines inside. They 
died, and he tried again, and still 
again, until he struck a variety 
that would endure the conditions 
he needed. They gave light and 
heat to replace his failing generator, and proved to be much more 
efficient producers of free oxygen 
than the tanks of Martian swordgrass which was standard on 
spaceships. 

He had been recovering water 
by the usual condensing methods, replacing losses by baking 
gypsum, but his niw plants 
"learned" to give him as much 
alcohol-free water as he wanted. 
He could have had the alcohol, 
too, but he didn't like to drink 
alone. And surely few men had 
ever been as lonely as he. 

"And all the time," said Gro

nauer, "I was trying other things, 
learning more about the symbiosis. After a few years I got the 
—the feel of it. I have not the 
scientific words to describe, but 
I can understand in my own way 
what goes on. I can look at a 
patch of growth and tell what it 
needs. I can look at a mutant 
form and after a while know what 
it may do. By selecting new 
strains for several generations, I 
can create a species which will 
fit well into the symbiosis. It was 
thus I made the light-berries, for 
my own use, and roots which can 
use ferric carbonate — the symbiosis could not handle that before, 
and limestone was getting short. 
And other things." 

"The — well, your spacesuit? 
The air plant on it?'* Hardesty 
felt embarassed at mentioning 
that. 

"My air compressing pump was 
going to wear out soon, I knew 
that, and by then it was more 
natural for me to work with the 
plants rather than dead machinery. The plants growing on my 
helmet, they give heat and light 
and free the oxygen out of my 
own breath. They live from my 
bloodstream. It is not much they 
need and they give me vitamins 
in return. Their rootlets entered 
my skin quite painlessly. 

"I have many kinds of foodplants now, with new tastes. You 
would like them, I think, but they 



are probably different from what 
you are used to. Go slow at first, 
eat only a little of the native 
food for a year, or however long 
your supplies last." 

Hardesty and Marian did not 
stop then to consider Gronauer*» 
odd phrasing of the invitation. It 
wouldn't have meant much to 
them; in twenty years of solitude, 
anyone would develop a curious 
turn of speech. 

Gronauer shuffled over to a 
desk, opened a drawer and took 
out an old logbook. Routine entries stopped with the shipwreck; 
what followed was page after 
page of fine script and painstakingly drawn illustrations. 

"Here are my notes," he said 
with a humble pride. "I have described and pictured everything. 
It is all that you need to know." 

Marian skimmed through it, 
and her thin intense features lit 
with a genuine glow. 

"It's wonderful, Mr. Gronauer,*" 
she said after a moment. "This 
marks some kind of epoch in biology, you know. Your name will 
go down in history." 

"Urn, yes." Hardesty forced 
himself back to the practical side 
of things. "Tell me, though, how's 
this world for radioactives? Any 
good deposits?" 

"A few deposits, but not worth 
working unless they have changed 
refining machinery a lot since my 
time." 



GARDEN IN THE VOID

"They haven't." The spaceman 
sighed. "Well, it was just a 
thought. We might as well blast 
off, then. Our ship's quarters are 
rather cramped, Gronauer, but 
we'll fix up the best we can for 
you." 

"For me?" The soft eyes widened. 

"Of course. Did you think we'd 
leave you behind?" 

Gronauer shook his gray-maned 
head. "But I cannot go. I have 
to stay here. I am the gardener, 
you see." 

"TTARDESTY took a restless 
turn about the cabin. His feet 
fell so lightly in the low gravity 
that it was soundless; he drifted 
ghftst-fashion between the cluttered instruments and controls of 
the Beltboat. 

"I don't know what to do," he 
said. "We can't take him along. 
Imagine having a raving lunatic 
crowded in here with us for 
months. But, damn it, we can't 
abandon him either." 

"We won't be abandoning him,** 
said Marian. "No one can say 
the situation is our fault. We'll 
let the government know, and 
he'll be all right till they send a 
ship for him." 

"Even so, it's the principle of 
the thing." He stared out the 
port, at the hugeness of night and 
frosty stars beyond, barren rock 
and mute loneliness, and the pri


mal terror of it struck deep into 
him. "Leaving a man alone in 
thai!" 

"He's done all right for twenty 
years, dear. He can last one more. 
After that, it'll be up to the official rescue party. We can suggest 
that they take a psychiatrist 
along." 

"You had no luck persuading 
him?" 

"None at all. I tried every day. 
I went over to his place while 
you were exploring the asteroid 
and talked to him." Wistfulness 
tinged her voice. "I told him 
about mankind and about Earth 
and summer moons and smoky 
hills in autumn, the way we've 
always dreamed it — I've never 
seen Earth, Jim, except in pictures, but somehow it's more real 
to me than all this empty universe. He isn't interested. I had 
to quit when he started getting 
angry." 

Hardesty went over and kissed 
her. "You're a good kid," he murmured. "Some day, some day 
soon, we're going home to Earth. 
No more space for us. It'll be 
roses growing over a house by the 
seaside.".. His fists clenched impotently. V'lf only there'd been a 
strike right here on this damned 
lump! But I hunted everywhere. 
Not a thing worth digging out. 
Gronauer told the truth." 

"Why should he have lied to 
us?"

"I don't know, except that he 
isn't normal any more. He doesn't 
react like a human being, even 
like a human who's been alone 
that long. Those plants have done 
something to him.'* Decision hardened Hardesty's lean face. 
"Well, he doesn't get many more 
chances to come along. We're not 
hanging around here another 
twenty -four hours. The sooner 
off, the sooner we'll find that lode 
and go home to Earth." 

"Yes, I suppose so." Marian 
turned back toward the microscopic galley. "He's coming over 
for dinner, you know. I talked 
him into that much, at least." 

"Well, I suppose there's no 
harm in it. Any special motive 
other than hospitality?" 

"Oh, we'll make it as bright and 
cheerful as we can. Homelike. It 
may change his mind." 

"I doubt that. But well have 
done our best." 

Hardesty glanced out the port 
again. The Sun was rising, a tiny 
brilliant disc winged with the zodiacal light. Its thin radiance 
crept over blackened lava and 
tumbled granite, seeming only to 
add to the ruinous desolation. 

MARIAN busied herself, getting the small luxuries they 
had saved for festive occasions 
out of the freezer, filling the ship 
with an aroma that made her husband lick his lips and grin. She 



hummed as she worked, and 
somehow the table she set was 
like a bit of Earth — the gleam of 
plate and silver, a centerpiece 
of flame»red swordgrass blooms, 
even the tiny porcelain dachshund that was their mascot. 

"We're putting on the dog," she 
explained solemnly. "Now you go 
dress, Jim." 

He put on clean dungarees, 
knotted his one and atrocious tie, 
and slicked back his sandy hair. 
Marian had put on a print dress 
and dainty slippers ; she suddenly 
looked pathetically young. Hardesty wished with irritation that 
there was no guest coming, that 
this might be for the two of them 
alone. Briefly, he knew that 
they'd never really fit in on Earth, 
for something of the high, cold 
solitude had entered them and 
they were too self-sufficient and 
aloof. 

But that was a well-known psychological phenomenon. It was 
one reason why few prospectors 
went back till they'd made their 
pile and could live independently 
of society. Another was the difficulty, these days, of getting any 
kind of decent job on Earth. 

It's not mankind we're going 
back to. We'll have neighbors, 
but our intimacy has become 
something that will never really 
let anyone else know us. It's 
Earth we want, Earth and .clean 
winds and the tall trees above. 



GARDEN IN THE VOID 



Sun and sea and sky. We want 
an environment that is home instead of deadly foe. We want the 
heritage of our race's evolution. 

The stars wheeled overhead, 
grand and lonely — he'd miss the 
sky of space now and then; he'd 
wonder at the dimness of constellations — but there'd be summer around him, a whisper of 
leaves, the chirp of crickets and a 
firefly bobbing through the warm 
and sleepy dark. No more metal, 
no more tanked air and canned 
food and armored life — "they 
would have come to their kingdom. 

Harsh sunlight gleamed off the 
figure that approached. Gronauer. 
Hardesty sighed, pumped out the 
airtock and opened its outer 
valve, When he closed that again 
and opened the inner one, a 
breath of searing cold eddied from 
the figure which stood there. 

Gronauer climbed out of his 
suit and looked timidly around 
him. He had dressed in an old 
coverall given him by Marian. 
It didn't fit well and he was obviously uncomfortable in it. For 
a moment, he shrank from his 
host's welcome. 

"It is — warm in here," he 
mumbled. 

"Sorry. Want me to lower the 
thermostat?" 

"No, please not to bother, I 
will get used to it. You were good 
to ask me." Gronauer edged ner


vously into the cabin. 

"Sit down. Dinner will be ready 

in a minute." 

"I cannot stay too long." The 
stooped gray form placed itself 
on the edge of a recoil chair, as 
if ready to leap from sudden 
menace. "In here I am cut off. 
The garden might need me and 
I would not know." 

"Isn't that the case in your 
own cabin?" 

"No, no. There are roots growing through the plates. My children inside are part of the whole 
system. I have sealed around the 
roots so air does not get out, but 
the garden can still call me." The 
words were jerky, stammering a 
little, and the eyes were never 
still. 

"I noticed that every disturbance seemed to set up vibrations 
in the plants. Is that how they — 
communicate?" 

"Yes. Formerly, before I came, 
those were just special stimuli 
causing certain stereotyped reactions. Like if a plant was hurt 
or killed by a rockfall, the vibrations triggered a reaction elsewhere, seeds were carried to the 
spot, a new plant was started. 
But after all these years, I can 
- — read? understand? — more. Often I know just what is wrong 
even before I go there. By sending 
my own pulses out, I can usually 
cause to be done whatever must 
bf done, even without going

there to do the work myself.** 
"A sort of nervous system, 
then." Hardesty rubbed his chin. 
"And now you've become its 
brain." The thought was unpleasant, somehow! 

Gronauer leaned forward eagerly. "And the eyes and hands, 
too. Many of the old functions 
have died out because I do it 
quicker and better, so the garden 
needs me. It would probably die 
without me. That is why I cannot 
go with you." 

"Soup's on," called Marian 
gaily. 

IT was mostly synthetics and 
dehydrates, but you wouldn't 
have known it, for she was an inspired cook. Hardesty dug in 
eagerly. Gronauer, though, only 
picked unhappily at his share. 

"I hope you like it, Mr. Gronauer," said Marian, a little 
stiffly. 

His twisted face tried to smile 
an apology. "I am not used to 
such fare for a long time. Garden 
food tastes different. It feels different." He waved a hand inarticulately. "How shall I make 
clear? It is that you eat things 
you have no kinship with; you 
kill them and devour them without any emotion. But / am nourished by something of which I 
am a part." 

Wryly, Hardesty's mind wandered off on the subject of au


tophagy. Given perfect surgical 
tools, shockless and bloodless amputation, how long could a man 
survive by eating parts of himself? 

"At first I wanted to go back." 
Gronauer's tongue seemed loosened all at once. Perhaps the beer 
he was not used to had taken 
hold already. "It is strange to 
remember how lonely I was — oh, 
for years I wept because there 
was no one and nothing else. But 
now I see that it is you who are 
lonely, each of you alone in a 
world of dead metal, shouting 
at someone else you cannot even 
be sure exists, cannot be sure 
what he is thinking of you or 
even if he is thinking at all." 

His grin was rather terrible. 
"How do you know you are not 
the only consciousness in a world 
of robots? Alone, alone, and you 
go to your grave and that is the 
end. But I belong. I feel the other 
life. It is part of me and I am part 
of it. My life has meaning and 
beauty — my life, married to other 
sensitive life, all of us together 
against the void. No, no, I cannot go back to Earth t" 

He lapsed into stillness, sat 
looking out of the port at the 
cruel brilliance of stars, and did 
not answer their remarks. Hardesty traded an exasperated look 
with Marian. 

"We're leaving, you know, .Gronauer,** he said after they had 



GARDEN IN THE VOID

finished and were sitting in the 
recoil chairs again. "This is your 
last chance to come with us." 

The gray, scarred head shook 
violently, so that the long hair 
swirled about the eyes. 

"I suppose you'll make out all 
right," said Hardesty. "We'll plot 
an orbit that'll get us to the 
nearest radio station — I think 
that's Pallas right now — as soon 
as possible, and from there we 
can relay word to Ceres. It won't 
be many months before a government ship comes for you." 

Gronauer shrank back and 
breath hissed between his teeth. 

"What then?" he gasped. 
"What will they do?" 

Despite himself, Hardesty was 
surprised at the violence of the 
reaction. 

"Why, you have a legal right 
to stay here if you want, of 
course." Unless the psychiatrists 
decide you're insane, his mind 
added grimly. "But there'll be 
scientists to study your garden 
and your discoveries. There'll be 
supplies and companionship — ** 

"I do not want it!" Gronauer 
stood up, trembling. "I have all 
I want. I am the gardener. Is 
that not enough? Do not tell them 
I am here. They would come and 
hurt the garden." 

"Under the law, I can't abandon you. It's all right to leave 
you, I guess, seeing that that's 
what you want, but not reporting 



a shipwrecked spaceman? I could 
get in trouble for that." 

"Who would know?" interjected Marian. She threw a wink 
at her husband over Gronauer's 
shoulder. Soothe him, humor him 
til! we're away from here. "If you 
wish, of course we'll keep your 
secret. It's your right to stay here 
alone if you really want to." 

"I want. I want!" 

"But think, Mr. Gronauer." 
She smiled at him warmly. 
"Think of what that will mean. 
You're getting old. You can't live 
forever. You'll die here and perhaps no one will discover this 
asteroid for centuries, or perhaps 
never. The garden will die without a human to attend it. If you 
let the scientists come, they'd 
preserve it as a natural wonder 
even when you were gone." 

"They would not understand." 
His voice was harsh and hostile. 
"The gardener must be part of 
the garden. He must grow into 
it, make it his life. Their scientific 
tending would not be enough." 

I think, said Hardesty's mind, 
that the old man is right. This is 
more than a mechanical set of 
duties to'be performed. You can't 
replace a human brain with an 
electronic computer, even the best 
and latest model, even one which 
actually thinks. You can't replace 
the gardener with a paid arfendant. ' Even if anyone would consent to live here alone, two or 



150

three years at a time, for any 
wages. Could you be hired to let 
roots tap your bloodstream? 

"Then that's that," he said 
aloud, coldly. "The garden will 
last your lifetime, undisturbed.** 

ORION wheeled mightily 
overhead, a glitter of frozen 
fire against an infinite clear dark. 
Gronauer sat still. There were 
trickles of sweat on his face, and 
he was breathing heavily. 

Marian tried to break the embarrassed silence: "It has been a 
great privilege to know you, Mr. 
Gronauer. And the garden. Was 
there anybody you once knew? 
Any message, perhaps?" 

"No," he said abstractedly. "No 
one. Not any more." 

After another minute, his eyes 
lifted to theirs with a kind of 
entreaty. 

"I have thought of this before," he blurted. "I am, as you 
say, old. There should be a race 
of human gardeners here, to carry 
on. The garden is still growing, 
still evolving. It needs men, and 
it gives them rewards you cannot 
now imagine. Would — would you 
think of staying here yourselves, 
having children here, too?" 

The thought was so grotesque 
that Hardesty had to laugh, a 
harsh sound jarring against the 
drumhead of tense silence. It 
seemed to strike Marian differently. 



"Children," she repeated. **Yes, 
Jim, we have to get back to Earth 
soon, while we can still be young 
with our kids." 

"You could have them now," 
said Gronauer. "Here." 

"No. It isn't fair to a child to 
raise it anywhere but on Earth. 
It isn't right to grow up in metal.** 
There was something haunted in 
her voice. "I know. It happened 
to me." 

"A child growing up here — ** 
The castaway's words trailed off. 
He drew a long breath. "Would 
you come with me?" he asked. 
"There is something I would like 
to show you. It will change your 
outlook on all this. You will at 
least see why I want to stay here 
alone." ' 

"What's that?" Despite himself, Hardesty felt a resurgence 
of interest. 

Damn it, the asteroid was 
unique. 

"I cannot explain in words. 
You will have to see. It is not so 
far to go.** 

"Well—" 

"It is the last gift I can give 
you." 

"Certainly well come," said 
Marian. "We'll be glad to, won't 
we, Jim?" 

"Sure," he said worriedly. He 
went to the spacesuit locker and 
opened it. "We'd better hurry, 
then. It'll be sunset again pretty 
quick." 



GARDEN IN THE VOID

"We will be following the Sun," 
said Gronauer. He lumbered over 
to his own suit where it stood in 
the airlock. Briefly, his gnarled 
hands stroked the , gray-green 
vines that draped it — an odd, 
wistful caress. 

Hardesty peeled off shirt and 
pants, revealing the insulated 
one-piece undergarment which 
served as padding below his armor. Marian exchanged her dress 
for a similar outfit. It looked well 
on her slim figure. Hardesty 
smiled as he helped her into her 
suit. 

Gronauer donned his own armor. He was still breathing hard. 
Something very odd here. When 
he was looking away, Hardesty 
afhbled quietly over to the tool 
chest, palmed his gun, and clipped 
it onto his spacesuit. Marian saw 
the gesture, started to say something, and throttled her words. 
Maybe he was right. There was 
at least no harm in it. 

Or in Gronauer. He might have 
been a little crazy by normal 
Earth standards, but what did 
those mean out here, three hundred million miles frpm the Sun? 
But he was not violent; he partook of the serene, timeless 
strength of the garden, A couple 
of hours' jaunt was not too much 
to please an old man trapped in 
a loneliness he himself no longer 
recognized. 



THEY came out under a sky 
that was flashing ice and bitter 
dark, with a wan, little sun low 
above ragged black stone. Gronauer led the way, a bounding 
figure of shadow and dazzling 
metal, now lost in a gully of 
night and now outlined grotesquely against the sprawl of 
stars. Hardesty swore at his 
speed, lengthened his own flat 
leaps, and felt rock and scree 
rattle beneath his boots. 

They were moving into the far 
bleak eye of the Sun, faster than 
the planetoid's axial spin. As the 
stars reeled insanely backward 
and the Sun began to climb again, 
Hardesty had a sudden weird 
feeling that he was moving back 
in time. He choked it down and 
concentrated on picking his way 
through the jumbled, looming, 
crazily tilted stones, down riven 
gulches and up hillsides that were 
heaped slabs of igneous rock, a 
nightmare landscape of ruin and 
murk. 

It was a zigzag path, he noticed dimly, leading into an area 
he had only skimmed through 
in his search, but he was too busy 
keeping " Up with Gronauer and 
watching Marian to think more 
deeply about it. His breath was 
harsh and loud in a suddenly hot 
spacesuit. 

The Sun was halfway down to 
the ppposite horizon when Gronauer went into another ravine 



152 




 



and out of sight. Hardesty folk-wed him, scrambled awkwardly 
down its steep sides, the undiffused glow of his flash picking 
boulders out like distorted faces. 
The crack was long and deep; he 
had to fumble in shadow for several minutes before he came out 
at the other end. Then he looked 
around. 

He stood on a gigantic basalt 
block sloping off to the edge of 
the world, overhead and around 
him the stars and the rime-frost 
arch of the Milky Way, and he 
was alone. 

"Gronauer!" His voice echoed 
rattling in his helmet. "Where the 
hell are you?'* 

Useless, of course. Gronauer 
didn't have a suit radio. But how 
the devil could he have gotten 
lost? 

Marian came leaping out of the 
ravine and over to stand by him. 
Her breathing was as hard as his. 

"What became of the old 
man?" she asked anxiously 

"That*s what I'd like to know. 
First he takes off like a bat out 
of Mars, and then he manages to 
lose us. Just went too fast? No, 
I was keeping up all right. He 
must have climbed the canyon 
wall ahead of me — I wouldn't 
have seen him — and taken off in 
some other direction." 

"But why, Jim?" 

"I don't know. He's mad, completely cracked, of course. Needs 



psychiatry in the worst way. But 
let the government worry about 
him. I'm fed up." Hardesty took 
a long stride forward. "Gome on, 
let's get back to the ship." 

"But he may just have made 
a mistake — " 

"Then he can catch up with us 
and lead us properly. The hell 
with him." 

"Well, he does seem a pretty 
hopeless case at that, doesn't he? 
The poor old man! I hope we see 
him again before we blast off." 

Hardesty shrugged. "Personally, I don't give a hang. Now 
let's see, which way is the Gold 
Rush?" 

"Why, I suppose — that way. 
Toward the Sun." 

"We zigzagged quite a bit, remember." Hardesty's hand rang 
against his metal leg in a slap 
of exasperation. "Nuts ! We're 
lost!" 

"There's the asteroid's pole 
star, up there, dear, and the Sun 
was west of it at setting, so our 
general direction should be that 

way." 

"Yeah. I hope it's not too general. Let's go." 

They set off along the sloping 
hillside toward a razor-backed 
spine of rock, black against the 
Milky Way. Neither one said 
anything. 

It was hard to orient yourself, 
if you didn't know every inch of 
the path. You had to twist and 



GARDEN IN THE VOID

turn, picking a slow way across 
a narrow landscape of crags and 
gullies and craters, sometimes lost 
in darkness that was like a flowing liquid, sometimes blinded by 
the thin yet vicious sunlight directly in your eyes. There were 
no broad outlooks. Vision was 
bounded on every hand. Only the 
turning sky had depth. 

Men had gotten lost on asteroids and wandered within a few 
miles of their ships till their oxygen gave out. It was not a 
comforting reflection. Hardesty 
shoved it resolutely out of his 
mind. 

AFTER an hour or so, they 
passed a region of plant 
growth. Hardesty looked at the 
stretch of garden with a rising 
bitterness in him. 

Low, silvery shrubs, lichenous 
growth spotting naked rock with 
red and brown and yellow, high, 
gaunt, yuccalike boles and gallows branches, sullen blood-crimson glow of heat bladders, huge, 
muscular roots plunging deep 
into the little world's iron heart, 
delicate faery tracing of vines 
looped and coiled between the 
shrubs, the throb and pulse of the 
garden's beating hearts — a reach 
of growth over the hills and out 
of sight, a frigid world made 
alive where no life should be, 
supreme triumph of organism 
over the chaotic waste of the 



frozen and hostile Universe — 

But it was too alien. The 
eldritch forms only added to the 
strangeness and loneliness, and he 
hated them. He kicked viciously 
and saw the pulse of alarm ripple 
out through the garden and over 
the near horizon, leaves rustling 
and whispering in the windless 
vacuum of space, the garden 
talking to itself. 

"Go ahead," he muttered. "Call 
your brain. That's all he is now, 
your brain and your hands. 
You've taken his soul away." 

"Don't, Jim," said Marian. 
"Please don't." 

"Oh, all right." He trudged in 
silence for a while before adding 
shamefacedly: "I'm being silly, 
I know. This is nothing but another instance of adaptation. Life 
on Earth is interdependent, too, 
a balance of nature. But I still 
don't like it." 

The Sun crossed the sky again 
and lowered behind them. Hardesty glanced worriedly at his 
wrist chrono. They'd been out for 
a good two hours; their tanks 
didn't hold very much more air. 

Don't get excited. That speeds 
up your metabolism, makes you 
burn oxygen all the faster, blunts 
the cool judgment you need. Take 
it easy. Slow and easy. Lots of 
time.

miliar yet. Rather, everything 
looked the same. All these leaning spires and tumbled boulders 
and gnarled old crater* looked 
alike and there was no way home. 

Marian's hand crept into his 
and he squeezed it, grateful for 
the touch of human nearness. 

"According to the stars, we're 
in the neighborhood now," he said 
as unemotionally as possible. 



"We'd better follow a spiral 
path — " 

Out of the corner of an eye, 
he saw the blue-white sheet of 
flame that spurted up over the 
horizon, saw it rising and spreading in a terrible brilliance that 
veiled the stars, and flung an arm 
across his eyes with a shout. The 
next moment the ground heaved 
and buckled under him, Aung him

spinning upward in the light 
gravity and bounced him against 
a lurching granite cliff, then 
tossed him back to the shaking, 
sundering rock below. 

"Marian!" he cried. "Marian V 

The fire was gone, but half the 
sky was blotted from sight by a 
column of smoke and dust, climbing and climbing like a monster 
spirit let out of Solomon's flask, 
and the ground shivered and rumbled and boulders danced on its 
surface. Hardesty clung to the 
rocks, clawing himself into naked 
stone, and his own screaming was 
loud and mad in his ears. 

"Jim! Are you all right, Jim?" 

They stumbled toward each 
other, falling and struggling as 
earthquake waves raced around 
and around the tiny world. They 
locked arms and lay on the cracking ground together ,and looked 
wildly at the nightmare scenery. 

r 1 THE seasick roll died away. A 
-*- miniature landslide came 
down a hill slope, slowly in the 
acceleration of feeble gravity, the 
slowness of fleeing through clinging mud. 

Hardesty and Marian got up 
and stumbled toward the black 
jinni which rose against the stars. 

He felt drained of emotion, a 
machine moving wearily toward 
some destined end. He topped 1 a 
ridge and looked' with' blank eyes 
at the ruin of' hit snip. It was 

scattered to the horizon and beyond, and the molten slag was 
still aglow beneath its resting 
place. 

"Gronauer," he said, just that 
one word, but it held loathing for 
the castaway and for himself, 
the time and anxiety he had 
wasted trying to help someone 
who didn't want to be helped, but 
mostly for his stupidity. 

Marian stared around. 
"Where?" 

"Gronauer? I don't know. He 
gave us the slip and came back, 
wrecked the safety controls and 
blew up the nuclear pile of the 
ship." 

"No," she said. "He wouldn't. 
It must have been a meteor." 

"Not where I landed. A meteor 
would have had to come straight 
down to hit the ship. Even then, 
it wouldn't blow up the pile.** 
He kicked savagely at a boulder, 
which flew off like a bird winging 
south. "Gronauer did it. You 
know that yourself." 

"Why?" Marian's whisper, like 
a dim voice from across that gulf 
of space that winked and jeered 
at him with a million hostile eyes, 
was so faint that even in his 
earphones he could scarcely hear 
it. "Why?" 

They saw the figure lurching 
up the slope toward them, hands 
dangling empty, the helmeted 
head overgrown with vines like 
an ancient Greek nature god. 



Hardesty drew his gun and rested 
it on his free elbow for steadiness. 
"Jim! No!" 

"Calm down," he said. "After 
what he did, I'm not taking any 
chances." 

"Are you going to — kill him?" 

"It's not a bad idea. He's insane, probably homicidal. We 
can't watch him all the time. . . ." 

Gronauer must have seen the 
gun, hut his slow pace did not 
slacken. One hand came up, tenderly caressing the vine that 
trailed off his shoulder. 

Hardesty kept the gun level, 
but he did not fire, merely tensed 
his finger on the trigger when 
Gronauer suddenly broke into a 
staggering run toward them. Marian gripped Hardesty' s arm. 

The old man fell over a rock 
and tried to get up. 

"First time I've seen him stumble," Hardesty said puzzledly, and 
lowered the gun. "Come on. The 
worst he can do is heave something at us. He's unarmed." 

Gronauer was still trying to 
crawl toward them when they 
reached him. He stopped and 
rolled over on one side to look 
up at them. Blood and foam and 
twisted vines and tangled beard 
could not hide the smile on his 
battered Hps. 

Tears glistened on Marian'i 
face in the keen starlight. Hardesty heard a sob in the radio 
and wanted to hold her close and

tell it wasn't real, that it had 
never been, real, and that the 
flame-colored woods of Earth's 
October lay just beyond the 
jagged, airless pinnacles. But he 
couldn't. Instead, he knelt when 
Gionauer motioned him closer, 
Bhd put his helmet against the 
cnstaway's.

matter. I am old and would have 
died soon. Then the garden would 
not have anyone to take care of 
it. Now it will." 

"Killing yourself and marooning us for the sake of some lousy 
vegetation," Hardesty said bitterly. "I should have known you 
were crazy and taken off right 
nway and sent help back to you.* 

Gionauer tried to shake his 
hi ad. "Not crazy. You will gather 
the supplies that were not destroyed in the explosion and move 
into my cabin. You will read my 
notes and tend my plants . . . 
and become part of the symbiosis, 
br I was." 



"I'd shoot Marian -and myself 
first !" 

"No, you will hope to be found 
by someone else. That hope will 
keep you from committing suicide. When you are ready to give 
up hoping, you will be — adjusted. 
You will like it here. This will be 
the home you were searching for; 
this will be your Earth. And you 
will have children—" 

"So your damned garden can 
go on!" 

Gronauer nodded and his smile 
grew wider even while his eyes 
lost their focus. 

"The garden will go on," he 
■aid, just before his breath ceased 
altogether. 

Hardesty stood up. Marian was 
clinging to him and her voice was 
insistent in his earphones, but he 
didn't hear her. He wis looking 
at the stars, the bright stars which 
neither comforted nor mocked, 
being too remote to care, and the 
green of the plants in the distance, 
and he thought with a dull despair that even now it looked like 
New England in October.
