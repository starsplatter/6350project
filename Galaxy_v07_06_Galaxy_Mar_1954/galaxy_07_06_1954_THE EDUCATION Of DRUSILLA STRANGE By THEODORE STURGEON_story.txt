THE EDUCATION Of DRUSILLA STRANGE By THEODORE STURGEON 

THE prison ship, under full 
shields, slipped down toward the cove, and made 
no shadow on the moonlit water, 
and no splash as it slid beneath 
the surface. They put her out 
and she swam clear, and the ship 
nosed up and silently fled. Two 
wavelets clapped hands softly, 
once, and that was the total 
mark the ship made on the prison 
wall. 

For killing the Preceptor, she 
had been sentenced to life inr 
prisonment. 

With torture. 

She swam toward the beach un
The grass invariably is greener on your own" 
planet-even if there is no grass there and 
would not be that color if there were anyl 


 



til smooth fluid sand touched her 
knee. She stood up, flung her long 
hair back with a single swift motion, and waded up the steep 
shingle, one hand lightly touching the bulging shoulder of the 
rocks which held the cove in their 
arms. 

Ahead she heard the slightest 
indrawn breath, then a cough. She 
stopped, tall in the moonlight. 
The man took a half-step forward, then turned his head sidewise and a little upward away 
from her, into the moon. 

"I'm — I beg your — sorry," he 
floundered. 

She sensed his turmoil, extracted its source, delved for alternative acts, and chose the one about 
which he showed the most curious 
conflict. She crouched back into 
the shadows by the rock. 

J didn't see you there. 

"I didn't see you until you . . . 
I'm sorry. Why am I standing 
here like this when you . . . I'll 
move on down the . . . I'm sorry." 

SHE took and fanned out 
his impressions, sorted them, 
chose one. My clothes — 

He started away from the 
rocks, looking about him, as if 
he might have been leaning 
against something hot, or something holy. "Where are they? Am 
I in the way? Shall I put them 
near the . . . I'll just move on 
down." 



No ... no clothes. Directly from 
him she took Where are they? 

"I don't see any. Somebody 
must've — are you sure you 
put them — where did you put 
them?" He was floundering again. 

She caught and used the phrase 
Why, who would . . . what a 
lowdown trick! 

"Is your — do you have a car 
up there?" he asked, peering up 
at the grassy rim of the beach. 
He added immediately, "But even 
if you got to the car . . ." 

/ have no car. 

"My God!" he said indignantly. "Anybody that would . . . 
here, what am I standing here 
yapping for? You must be chilled 
to the bone." 

He was wearing a battered 
trench coat. He whipped it off 
and approached her, three-quarters backward, the coat dangling 
from his blindly extended arm 
like a torn jib on a bowsprit. She 
took it, shook it out, turned it 
over curiously, then slipped into 
it so that it fell around her the 
way it had covered him. 

Thank you. 

She stepped out of the shadows, and the huge relief he felt, 
and the admixture of guilty regret that went with it made her 
smile. 

"Well !" he said, rubbing his 
hands briskly. "That's better, 
now, isn't it?" He looked up the 
lonely beach, and down. "Live

around here somewhere?" 
No. 

"Oh." He said it again, then, 
"Friends bring you down?" he 
asked diffidently. 

She hesitated. Yes. 

"Then they'll be back for you!" 

She shook her head. He scratched his. Suddenly he stepped away 
from her and demanded, "Look, 
you don't think I had anything 
to do with stealing your clothes, 
do you?" 

Oh, no! 

"Well, all right, because I 
didn't, I mean I couldn't do a 
thing like that, even in fun. What 
I was going to say, I mean, now 
I don't want you to think 
anyth . . ." He ground to a stop, 
took a breath and tried again. 
"What I mean is, I have a 
little shack over the rise there. 
You'd be perfectly safe. I have 
no phone, but there's one a mile 
down the beach. I could go and 
call your friends. I mean I'm not 
one of those . . . well, look, you 
do just what you think is best." 

She searched. She felt it 
emerged correctly : / really 
mustn't put you to that trouble. 
But you're very kind. 

"I'm not kind. You'd do exactly the same thing for me, 
now wouldn't . . ." 

He stopped because she was 
laughing silently, her eyes turned 
deep into the corners to look 
at him. She laughed because she 



had sensed his startled laughter 
at what he was saying even before it had uncurled. 

"I — can't say you would at 
that," he faltered, and then his 
laughter surfaced. By the time it 
had run its course, she was striding lithely beside him. 

npHEY walked for a while in 
silence, until he said, "I do 
the same thing myself, go swimming in the — I mean without . . . 
at night. But generally not this 
late in the year." 

She found this unremarkable 
and made no reply. 

"Uh," he began, and then faltered and fell silent again. 

She wondered why he felt it 
so necessary to talk. She probed, 
and discovered that it was because he was excited and frightened and guilty and happy all 
at once, full of little half-finished 
plans concerning cold odds and 
ends of food and the contents of 
a clothes closet, the breathless 
flash of a mental picture of her 
emerging from the water with 
certain details oddly highlighted, 
the quick blanking of the picture 
and the stern frown that did it, 
the timid hope that she did not 
suspect feelings that he could not 
control . . . Oh, yes, he must talk. 

"You have a — do you mind if 
I say something personal?" 

She looked up attentively. 

"You have a funny sort of way 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



125 



of talking. I mean — " he leaned 
close — "you hardly move your 
lips when you talk." 

She turned her head slightly 
and flexed her lips. She made the 
effort and said aloud, "Oh?" 

"Maybe it's the moonlight," he 
informed himself. Inwardly he 
pictured her still face and said 
Strange, strange, strange. "What's 
your name?" 

"Dru. Drusilla," she said carefully. It was not her name, but 
she had probed and discovered 
that he liked it. "Drusilla 
Strange." 

"Beautiful," he breathed. "Say, 
that's a beautiful name, did you 
know that? Drusilla Strange. 
That's just . . . just exactly right." 
He looked about at the cool white 
blaze of the beach, at the black 
grass under the moon. "Oh!" he 
said abruptly, "I'm Chan. Chandler Behringer. It's a clumsy sort 
of name, hard to say, not like — " 

"Chandler Behringer," she said. 
"It sounus like a little wind 
catching its tail around a — " 
she dipped into him swiftly — 
"palm frond." 

"Huh!" he shouted. It was one 
syllable of a laugh, and it was 
sheer delight. Then he found the 
rest of the laugh. 

He put his hand on her arm 
just above the elbow and steered 
her off the beach. The feel of her 
flesh under the flat close fabric 
caused a shock that ran up his 



arm and straight through his 
defenses. 

"Here's my place," he said, 
with all the wind and none of 
the cordal vibration necessary to 
make a voice. He moved away 
from her and marched up the 
slope, frowning, leading the way. 
He ducked into a lean-to porch 
and fumbled too busily with a 
latch. "You'd better wait for a 
moment while I light the lamp. 
It's sort of cluttered." 

She waited. The doorway swallowed him, and there was a fumbling, and a scratching, and 
suddenly the cabin had an interior. She moved inside. 

"You needn't be afraid to look 
around," he said presently, watching her. 

SHE did, immediately. She had 
been looking straight at him, 
following his critical inventory of 
the entire place, and she now 
knew it every bit as well as he. 
But, "Oh," she said, "this is — " 
she hesitated — "cosy." 

"A small place," he said, "but 
it's dismal." He laughed, and explained apologetically, "I got that 
line from a movie." 

She sorted out the remark, 
wondered detachedly why he had 
made it, half-heartedly probed 
for the reason, then dropped it as 
unessential effort. 

"A nice soft blanket," he said, 
lifting it. Her hands went reflex

ively to the top button of the 
trench coat and fell away at his 
next words. "When I go out, you 
just wrap yourself up nice and 
snug. I won't be long. Now give 
me the number." 

His mental code for "number" 
was so brief and so puzzling — 
a disk with holes in it superimposed on ruled paper — that she 
was quite at a loss. "Number?" 

"Your friends. I'll phone them. 
They can bring you some clothes, 
take you home." He laughed selfconsciously. "1*11 try to say it so 
that ... I mean, make it sound 
. . . Do you know, I haven't the 
first idea of "just what I'll tell 
them?" 

"Oh," she said. "My friends . . . 
have no phone." 

"No — oh. What, no phone?" 
He looked at her, around at the 
walls, and inevitably at the bed. 
It was a very small bed. He 
gestured weakly at the door. "A 
. . . telegram, maybe, but that 
would take a long time, and . . . 
Oh, I know. I have clothes, dungarees and things. A lumberjack 
shirt. Why didn't I think of it? 
Girls wear all that kind of — but 
shoes, I don't know . . . And then 
I'll get you a taxi!" he finished 
triumphantly, and the chaos 
within him was, to misuse the 
term, deafening. 

She considered very, very 
carefully and then said, "No taxi 
could take me back. It's much 



too far for a taxi to travel." 
"Isn't there anyone that — " 
"There isn't anyone," she said 

firmly. 

After a long, complicated pause, 
he asked gently, "What happened?" 

She averted her face. 

"It was something sad," he halfwhispered, and although he was 
quite still, she could feel the 
tendrils of his sympathy reaching 
out toward her. "That's all right, 
don't worry. Don't," he said loudly, as if it were the first word 
of a very important pronouncement; but it would not form. He 
said at last, inanely, "I'll make 
coffee." 

He crossed the room, raising 
Jiis hand to pat her shoulder as 
he passed, checking it, not touching her at all, while the echo of 
that first shock bounded and rebounded within him. He bent 
over the stove, and in a moment 
the evil smell of the lamp, which 
had been pressing closer and 
closer upon her consciousness, 
was eclipsed completely by what 
was to her a completely overpowering, classic, catastrophic 
and symphonic stench. Her eyelids flickered and closed as she 
made a tremendous nervous effort 
and at last succeeded in the 
necessary realignment of her carbon-oxygen dynamic. And in a 
moment she could ignore the 
fumes and open her eyes again.

Chan was looking at her. 

"You'll have to stay." 

"Yes," she said. She looked at 
his eyes. "You don*t want me to." 

"I want you to," he said hurriedly, "I want . . ." He thought 
She's in trouble and she's afraid 
Vm going to take advantage of it. 

"I'm in trouble," she said, "but 
I'm not afraid you'll take advantage of it." 

¥TE flashed a startling white 
grin. She trusts me. Then the 
grin faded and the internal frown 
clamped down. But it could not 
hide the thought: She's . . . she 
expects . . . she's maybe the kind 
who . . . 

"I'm not the kind," she said 
levelty, "who — " 

"Oh, I know I know I know!" 
he interrupted rapidly, and with 
it he thought Why is she so 
damned sure of herself? 

"I just don't know what to do I" 
she said. 

He smiled again. "You just 
leave everything to me. We'll 
make out fine, I mean you're 
quite safe, you know. And in the 
morning everything will look a 
lot brighter. Oh, that coat, that 
wet old coat. Here," he bustled, 
"here — here." 

From curtained clothes -pole 
and paper-lined orange crate came 
blue denims, a spectral holocaust 
in woolen plaid, a pair of socks 
of a red that did not belong 




within four miles of any color 
in the shirt. She looked at the 
clothes and at him. He turned his 
back. 

"I'll go on with the . . . cookcook-coffee and you know," he 
said nervously. 

She took off the trench coat 



128 




 




and while her fingers solved the thought whimsically, or it must 

logical problem called buttons die from nervous exhaustion in 

and the topological one whereby four. The dungarees gouged and 

a foot enters a sock, she pondered rasped her skin until she damped 

Chandler Behringer's extraor- its sensitivity, but the feel of the 

dinary sensitivities. Either this heavy, washed wool of the shirt

planet in nine generations, she He set out plates and in a

129 



moment slid a handsome orangeand-white edible onto them. She 
looked at it with interest, and 
then her eyes traveled to the 
small table by the stove, and she 
saw the shells. By the Fountain 
Itself, she said silently, eggs! 
They eat EGGS! 

She forced her feelings into a 
desensitized compartment of her 
mind and corked it. Then she sat 
opposite Chandler and ate heartily. The coffee was bitter and, to 
her palate, gritty, but she drank 
her second cup with composure. 
He's so very pleased that I eat 
with him, she thought. They 
probably do everything gregariously, even where cooperation is 
not involved. She was conscious 
of no disgust, for that, too, was 
insulated — and so it must stay 
for the rest of her imprisonment, 
which is to say the rest of her 
life. 

The food seemed to have relaxed him; a sphygmomanetic 
allocation, she deduced. And involuntary. How very confining. 
His chatter had eased and he was 
taking a silent pleasure in watching her. When she met his eyes 
finally, he leaped up nervously 
and scraped and washed the 
plates energetically. He thought, 
/ wonder if she liked it. And : 
She knows how to be a guest, 
and how to keep herself from 
plunging into the dish-washing, 
putting them back in the wrong 



place and all. And: / like doing 
things for her. I wish I could do 
everything for . . . And then the 
frown. 

Suddenly in a rush of embarrassment and self -accusation, he 
spun around and said, "I haven't 
even asked you, I mean told you, 
if you, I mean, well, this is just 
a shack and we haven't all the 
fixtures." 

She looked at him blankly, 
then probed. 

Oh. This is loaded, too. But 
not eating. Amazing. 

She made it as easy for him as 
she could. She rose and gave him 
the quick nervous smile that was 
correct. 

"It's outside," he said. "To 
your left. That little path." 

She slipped outside, stalked 
directly down to the water's edge 
and with as little effort and even 
less distress than a polite cough 
might have cost her, she vomited 
up the eggs and the coffee. She 
had eaten, after all, only two 
days ago. 

HE had the bed made up when 
she came in, the pillow 
smooth, crisp sheets flat and 
diagonally folded at the head end. 

"I bet you're as tired as I am," 
he said. "And that's a whole 
lot." 

"Oh," she said, looking at the 
bed. For sleeping! What would 
she want sleep for? Because of a 




 



phylic habit unbroken in these 
savages since they were forced 
to spend the dark hours immobile in a rocky hole to save themselves from nocturnal carnivores? 
But she said, "Oh, how neat. But 
I can't take your bed. I'll sit 
up." 

"You'll do no such thing," he 
said severely, and her eyes widened. He busied himself with a 
blanket roll and sleeping bag, 
which he put on the floor just 
as far — four feet or so — as it 
could possibly go from the bed. 
"I love this old bag. Look, nylon 
and down — the only expensive 
thing I own. Except my guitar." 

She visualized "guitar" and immediately put it down as something to investigate. The flash she 
got in his coding was brief, but 
sufficient for her to recognize 
its size, shape and purpose, and 
to conclude that although its 
resonant volumes were gross and 
its vents inaccurately placed, it 
was closer to the engineering she 
knew and understood than most 
things she had glimpsed here so 
far. 

"You didn't tell me you played 
the guitar," she said politely. 

"I get paid for it," he said, 
yawning, and she knew that this 
yawn belonged to this remark and 
not to the circumstance of somnolence. "Ready for bed?" 

Patiently she bowed to his 
formalities. "You're very kind." 



He went to the lamp and turned 
it out. The low moon streamed 

in. 

HE hesitated, slid into his 
sleeping bag after removing 
only his shoes. There ensued a 
considerable amount of floundering, ducking, and thumping on 
the floor, and at last he brought 
his trousers out, folded as small 
as possible. He wadded them between the corner of the sleeping 
bag and the wall as if they were 
a secret. Then he sat up and took 
off his shirt. He hung it on the 
corner of the window sill, lay 
down, 2ipped the bag up to his 
neck, and ostentatiously turned 
on his side with his face to the 
wall. "Good night." 

"Good night," she said. Resignedly she got between the 
sheets, as indicated by the foldeddown corner, pulled up the blanket, porpoised out of her trousers, 
folded them, brought them out 
and hid them; removed her shirt, 
reached out a long arm and hung 
it on the other corner of the 
window sill. Did he still have 
his socks on? He did. She wriggled her toes and slightly desensitized her ankles where the 
weave pressed them. 

"You're perfectly safe. Don't 
worry about a thing." 

"Thank you, Chan. I feel safe. 
I'm not worried. Good night." 
"Good night. Dru," he said 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



131 



suddenly, lifting himself on one 
elbow. 

"What is it?" 

He lay down again. "Good 
night." 

She watched with deep interest 
the downward spiralings of his 
thoughts into the uprising tides of 
sleep. It happened to him suddenly, and the "noise" factor of 
his conscious presence slumped 
away out of the room. 

And the torture began. 

SHE had known it was there, 
but Chandler Behringer was 
a fine foil for it. He alleviated 
nothing, but he set up a constant distraction purely by the 
bumbling, burrowing busyness of 
his mind. Now it had faded to 
a whisper, to an effective nothing, 
and her torture poured down on 
her. From the warp-shielded, indetectible satellites which guarded the prison planet and 
administered the punishment, agony poured down to her. 

Thus it will be tonight, and 
the next and next nights, and 
every night for all of my own 
forever. Hushed in the day and 
hungry and sweet at night, it 
will rain down on me. And I can 
lie and relax, and I can harbor 
my anger and anchor my anguish, 
but the tide will rise, the currents will tug until they break 
me, if it takes two hundred years. 
And when I'm broken by it, the 




132 




 



torture will go on and on — and on. 

Most of the torture was music. 

Some of the torture was singing. 

And a little of the torture was 
a thing hardly describable in 
Earthly terms, which made pictures — not on a screen, not on 
the mind like memories, however 
poignant — but pictures so clear 
and true that the sudden whip of 
a pennant brought, a second later, 
spent wind to buffet the eyelids, 
pictures wherein one walked 
barefoot on turf and knew a 
mottling of heat and coolth in the 
arches, with the moisture of the 
grass its broken green bleeding. 
These were pictures where to 
loose a sling was to know 
the draw of the pectorals and the 
particled bite of soil under the 
downdriven toenails, and to picture a leap was to kick away a 
very planet, to have that priceless quarter-second of absolute 
float, and to come back to a cushioning of one's own litheness. 

This was music of an ancient 
planet peopled by a race far older. 
This was music with the softness and substance of weathered 
granite, and the unwinding intricacies of a fern. It was ferocious music with a thick-wristed 
control of its furies so sure that 
it could be used for laughter. 
And altogether it was music that 
rose and cycled and bubbled and 
built like the Fountain Itself. 

This was the high singing of 



birds beauty-lost in altitude, and 
the heavier, upward voices expressed by the reaching of trees. 
It was the voice of the tendon 
burst for being less strong than 
the will, and the heart of the 
sea, and its base was the bass of 
pulsations of growth (for even a 
shouldering tree trunk has a note, 
if listened to for years enough) 
and altogether these were the 
voices that made and were made 
by the Fountain Itself. 

And these were the pictures of 
the Fountain Itself . . . 

And such were the tortures of 
those who were exiled, imprisoned 
and damned. 

She lay there and hated the 
moonlight; the moon she regarded 
as ugly and vulgar and new. It 
seemed to her an added lash, as 
were all things similar and all 
things contrasting to the world 
she had lost. She turned eyes 
grown cold on the sleeping man, 
and curled her Up; the creature 
was a clever counterpart, a subtle 
caricature, of the worst of the 
men of her race, in no way perfect, in no way magnificent, but 
in no way so crude an artifact 
as to permit her to forget what 
was surely its original. 

By comparison and by contrast, 
Earth, this muddy, uncouth ball 
of offal, pinioned her soul to her 
home. Earth had everything that 
could be found on her world — 
after a fashion — racecourses com


134 




 



paratively an armspan wide, racing dun rats ridden by newts in 
Bleazy silks . . . men whose eyes 
sparkled in the sun not quite as 
much as her racial brother's 
might when he, with only his 
shaded hand to help him, sought 
and found a ghostly nebula. 

CELL by interlocking cell, ion 
by osmotic particle, she belonged elsewhere. And Earth, 
which was her world falsified ; 
and the endless music, which was 
her world in truth — these would 
never let her forget it. 

So she cursed the moonbeams 
and the music sliding down them, 
and swore that she would not be 
broken. She could soak herself 
in this petty planet, zip it up 
to her neck to conceal anything 
of her real self in her pettiest 
acts; she could don the bearing 
and the thoughts themselves of 
Earth's too-fine, too-empty puppets — and still inwardly she 
would be herself, a citizen of her 
world, part of the Fountain Itself. 
As long as she was that, in any 
fiber, she could not be completely 
an exile. Excommunicated she 
might be; bodily removed, wingless and crawling, trembling under the dear constant breath of 
her home; but until she broke, 
her jailers had failed for all their 
might and righteousness. 

The sun rose and turned her 
away from her bitterness, a little. 



Chan's sleeping consciousness 
came close and roared around 
her, fell back into blacknesses. 
She rose and went to the door. 
The sea was rose-gold and 
breathing and the sun was aloft, 
a shade too near, too yellow, and 
too small. She damned it heartily 
with a swift thought that spouted 
and spread and hung in the air 
like the mist from a fountain, 
and went and dressed. 

She glanced at the percolator, 
understood it, and deftly made 
coffee. At its first whisper in the 
tube. Chan sighed and his consciousness came upward with a 
rush. Drusilla slipped outside. 
Patience she had in full measure, 
but she felt it unworthy to tap 
it for such unwieldy formalities 
as she knew she must witness 
if she stayed in the room during 
the cracking of his nylon chrysalis. 

There was a hoarse shout from 
inside, a violent floundering, and 
then Chandler Behringer appeared. He was tousled and 
frightened. His panic, she noted, 
had been sufficient to drive him 
outdoors without his shirt, but 
not without his trousers. He 
squeezed his eyelids so tight shut 
that his cheekbones seemed to 
rise,- then opened them and saw 
her standing by the beach margin. The radiance that came from 
his face competed for a moment 
with the early tilting sunlight. 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



135 



"I thought you'd gone." 

She smiled. "No." 

She came to him. His eyes devoured her. He raised both hands 
together and placed them, one 
on the other, on his left collarbone. She understood that he was 
concealing the vestigial nipples 
(which were absent in males of 
her race) with his wrists. She examined this reflex with some curiosity, and filed away for future 
puzzlement the fact that he did 
this because he wore trousers; 
had they been bathing trunks, the 
reflex would not have appeared. 
He took a breath so deep that 
she empathized his pain. 

"You are the most beautiful 
woman I have ever seen," he said. 

She did not doubt it, and had 
no comment. 

"The most beautiful woman 
who ever lived," he murmured. 

Abruptly she turned her back, 
and now it was her eyes which 
squeezed shut. "I am not\" she 
said in a tone so saturated with 
hatred and violence that he 
stepped back almost into the 
doorway. 

Without another word she 
strode off, down the beach, her 
direction chosen solely by the 
way she happened to be facing 
at the time. In a moment she was 
conscious of his feet padding after 
her. 

"Dru, Dru, don't go!" he panted. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean, 



hah! to do anything that hah! 
oh, I was only — " 

She stopped and turned so 
abruptly that had he taken two 
more steps they would have collided. Far from taking steps, however, he had all he could do to 
stay upright. 

SHE stood looking at him, unmoving. On her face was no 
particular expression ; but there 
was that in the high -held head, 
the slightly distended nostrils, 
the splendid balance of her stance, 
and her gracefully held, powerful hands that made approach 
impossible. His eyes were quite 
round and his lips slightly parted. 
He extended one hand and moved 
his mouth silently, then let the 
hand fall. His knees began to 
tremble visibly. 

She turned again and walked 
away. He stood there for a long 
time watching her go. When she 
was simply a brilliant fleck on the 
brightening dunes, the purposeless hand came forward again. 

"Dru?" he said, in a voice softened to soprano inaudibility by 
all the cautions of awe. And she 
was gone, and he turned slowly, 
as if he had a tall and heavy 
weight on his rounded shoulders, 
and plodded back to the cabin. 

She found a road which paralleled the beach and climbed to it. 
Fools cluster about the Universe, 
she thought, like bubbles about

the fountain pool, shifting and 
pulsing at random, without design, purpose or function. She 
had left such a fool and she was 
such a fool. There was far more 
culpability in her folly than in 
that of the man. He had little 
control over what he might say, 
and less understanding, because 
of his nature and his limitations. 
Neither his faculties nor his conditioning could enable him to understand why she felt such fury. 

She stabbed her heels into the 
sandy roadbed as she walked. She 
ground her teeth. The most beautiful woman who ever lived . . . 

Her beauty! 

Where, exile — where, criminal, 
has your beauty brought you? 

She strode on, her mood so 
black it all but eclipsed the torture music. 

Perhaps fifteen minutes later, 
she became conscious of a shrill 
ultrasonic, a rapidly pulsing, 
urgent, growing thing that would 
be a silence to all but her. She 
slowed, stopped finally. The 
sound came from behind her, but 
she would not confuse her analysis by looking back. She listened 
as an intervening wind carried 
the vibrations away and then let 
them come back again, nearer, 
stronger. She sensitized her bare 
feet; she raised an arm and took 
the vibrations on the back of her 
hand. She became conscious of 
synchronous sounds. 

ORUSILLA STRANGE < 



Something rotated at approximately thirty-eight hundred and 
forty rpm. Something was chaindriven and the chain was not a 
metal. Something pounded . . . 
no, paced — something rolled endless soft cleats on the earth. She 
heard the straining of coil springs, 
the labored slide of heavy transverse leaf-springs, the make-andbreak in the meniscus of the oil 
guarding busy pistons. 

The utter stupidity of so complex a thing as an automobile 
was, to her, more wondrous than 
a rainbow. 

At last she turned to look, 
and in a moment she saw it climb 
a rise some two mijes away. The 
piercing ultrasonic was beyond 
bearing, and she adjusted her 
hearing to eliminate everything 
between eighty-six and eightyeight thousand cycles. 

"|t*ORE comfortable now, she 
waited patiently. The car 
slid down a straight and gentle 
grade toward her, spitting sunlight through its chromium teeth, 
palming aside the morning air 
and pressing it back and down 
its sleek flanks, while underneath, 
where there was no hint of fairing, air shocked and roiled and 
shuddered and troubled what dust 
it could find in the sandy road. 
It was a very large and very new 
car. Drustlla watched it, wideeyed. She^ came to wonder what 
. M 

v •• 137 



conclusions one would have regarding these — these savages, if 
one knew nothing of them but 
such a vehicle. What manner of 
man streamlines only where he 
can see? 

The lovely thought, then: It's 
a world of clowns. 

She smiled; the driver saw it 
and his foot came down on the 
brake pedal. The car threw down 
its glittering baroque nose, slid a 
hand's breadth, and lowered itself sitzwise into its warm bath 
of springs. 

The driver's eyes were long and 
flat and his nose and chin were 
sharp. Drusilla watched what he 
was doing, which was watching 
himself watch her. 

Suddenly he said, "How far is 
it to — " and before the first word 
was spoken, she knew he was 
completely familiar with these 
roads. 

She said, "Your — " and raised 
her hand to point accurately at 
the hood, while she searched him 
for the term. "Your rocker-arm's 
not getting oil. The third one 
from the front." Even while the 
motor idled, the soundless shriek 
of that dry friction would have 
been unbearable had she let it. 

"Sounds all right to me," he 
shrugged. He looked — he journeyed, rather — down from her 
eyes, down until he saw that her 
feet were bare. He left his gaze 
where it was and said, "Let me 



give you a lift." He half turned 
then, reached one thin spidery 
arm back and across without 
looking, and the rear door swung 
open. 

Drusilla took one step forward 
and only then saw that the man 
was not alone in the car. She 
stopped, amazed — not at the 
woman who sat there, but at the 
fact that perceptions such as hers 
had missed so much. She glanced 
at the man, and realized that it 
was his feeling, or lack of it. that 
had numbed and blinded her to 
everything about the woman who 
sat beside him. She was companion reduced to presence, minified to fixture, reduced to a very 
limbo of familiarity. Drusilla 
stared at her, and the woman 
stared back. 

She was a small woman, compact, so coiffed and clad that 
she was only a blandness. What 
kept her from being featureless 
as an egg was a pair of achingly 
blue eyes large enough for a being half again her size, and 
a perfect mouth painted such a 
transcendental, pupil - shrinking 
red that surely it would melt 
fuse-wire. Her wide eyes were 
blank. 

To Drusilla's horror, a growth 
like an iridescent liver sprang 
into being between the flaming 
lips, grew to the size of a fist and 
collapsed limply. The lips parted, 
a pink tongue deftly caught, 



138 




 



cleared, and drew the limp matter 
back between an even flicker of 
paper-white teeth. And again the 
face was molded and smooth and 
motionless. 

"My wife," said the man, "so 
you're chaperoned. My God, Lu, 
you got bubble gum again." The 
woman took her gaze away from 
Drusilla and placed it on the 
driver, but there was otherwise no 
change. "Get in." 

DRUSILLA'S mind played 
back a fleeting inner sensation she had taken from him 
when he had said "My wife." It 
was . . . pride? No. Admiration? 
Hardly! Compliment; that was it. 
This woman was a compliment he 
paid himself. He had no tiny 
fleck of doubt that he was admired for her careful finish. 

The big blue eyes swung to 
her again and she probed. 

For a ghastly micro-second, 
she had all the sensations of 
walking into a snakepit with 
chloroform on her scarf. She recoiled violently, moved far back 
to the low bank; and she shuddered. 

"Come on, uh, hey, what's the 
matter?" the driver called. 

Drusilla shook her head twice, 
not so much in refusal as in an 
attempt to escape from something 
that was laying clammy strands 
of silk on her face and hair. Without another word, she turned and 



walked away down the road, behind the car. 
"Hey!" 

Drusilla did not look back. 

He started the car and drove 
off slowly. In a moment, the 
woman leaned forward and 
tugged hard on the wheel. The 
car heeled back on the road, 
and at last he took his eyes from 
the rear view minor. 

"Now what's with her?" he demanded of the windshield wiper. 

Lu blew another bubble. 

When the car was gone, Drusilla went slowly back and past 
the place she had met it, and on 
toward the town. From her marrow she swore a mighty oath that 
never again would she be trapped 
into sending her probes into such 
a revolting mess. The driver 
hadn't been like that; Chan 
Behringer hadn't. Yet she knew 
with a terrible certainty that 
there must be thousands like that 
creature here on the prison planet. 

So as she walked she devised 
something, a hair-triggered synaptic structure, a reaction pattern that could, even without her 
conscious knowledge, detect the 
faintest beginnings of a presence 
such as this; and it would snap 
down her shields, isolate her, protect her, keep her clean. 

She was badly shaken. The 
presence of that woman had 
shaken her, but the most devastating thing of all was the 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



knowledge that she could be 
shaken. It was a realization most 
difficult for her to absorb; it had 
little precedent in her cosmos. 
Walking, she shuddered again. 

DRUSILLA came to the town 
and wandered until she found 
a restaurant which needed a 
waitress. She borrowed the price 
of a pair of beach sandals from 
the weary cashier and went to 
work. She found a little room 
and at the end of the second day 
she had the price of a cotton 
dress. 

In the second week she was a 
stenographer and, in the second 
month, secretary to the head of 
a firm which made boat-sails and 
awnings. She invested quietly, 
sold some poems, a song, two articles and a short story. In terms 
of her environment, she did very 
well indeed, very fast. In her own 
estimate, she did nothing but 
force her attention randomly 
away from her torture. 

For the torture, of course, continued. She bore it with outward 
composure, shucked it off as casually as, from time to time, she 
changed her name, her job, her 
hair-styling and her accent. But 
like the lessons she learned, like 
the knowledge of the people she 
met and worked with, the torture 
accumulated. She could estimate 
her capacity for it. It was large, 
but not infinite. She could get rid 



of none of it, any more than she 
could get rid of knowledge. It 
could be compacted and stored. 
As long as she could do this with 
the torture, she was undefeated. 
But she was quite capable of calculating intake against capacity 
and she had not much time. A 
year and a half, two . . . 

She would stand at the window, absorbing her punishment, 
staring up into the night sky with 
her bright wise eyes. She could 
not see the guardian ships, of 
course, but she knew they were 
there. She knew of their killerboats which could, if necessary, 
slip down in moments and blast 
a potential escapee, or one about 
to violate the few simple rules 
of a prisoner's conduct. 

Sometimes, objectively, she 
marveled at the cruel skill of the 
torture. Music alone, with its ineffable spectrum of sadness and 
longing and wild nostalgic joy, 
could have been enough and 
more than enough for a prisoner 
to bear; but the sensory pictures, 
the stimulative and restimulative 
flow and change of taste and motion and all the subtleties of the 
kinetic senses — these, mixed 
and mingled with music, charging 
in where music lulled, marching 
in the footprints of the music's 
rhythmic stride — these were the 
things which laughed at her barriers, sparred with her, giggling; 
met her fists with a breeze, her 



140 




 



rapier with a gas, her advances 
with a disappearance. 

There was no fighting attacks 
like these. Ignorance would have 
been a defense, but was of no 
use to her who was so nervealive to all the torture's sense and 
symbolism. All she could do was 
to absorb, compact, and hope that 
she could find a defense before 
she broke. 

SO she lived and outwardly 
prospered. She met some humans who amused her briefly, 
and others she avoided after one 
or two meetings because they reminded her so painfully of her 
own people — a smile, a stride, a 
matching of colors. If she met 
any others with the terrifying 
quality of the woman in the car, 
she was not aware of it ; that part 
of her defense, at least, was secure. 

But the torture still poured 
down upon her, and after half a 
year she knew she must take some 
steps to counteract it. At base, 
the solution was simple. If she 
did nothing, the torture would 
crush her, and there was no surcease in that, for having broken, 
she would go on suffering it. She 
could kill herself, but that in itself would fulfill the terms of her 
sentence — "life imprisonment — 
with torture." There was only one 
way — to be killed, and to be 
killed by the guardians. She was 
not under a death sentence. If 



she forced one, they would have 
to violate their own penalty, and 
she would be able to die unbroken, as befits a Citizen of the Fountain Itself. 

More and more she studied the 
sky f knowing of the undetectable 
presence of the guardians and 
their killer-boats, knowing that 
if she could think of it, there 
must be a way to bring one of 
them careening silently down on 
her to snuff her out. She made 
sendings of many kinds — even 
of the kind she had used to extinguish the life-force of the Preceptor — without altering the 
quality or degree of torture in 
the slightest. 

Perhaps the guardians sent, but 
did not receive; perhaps nothing 
could touch them. Geared to the 
pattern of a Citizen's mind and 
conditioning, they patiently produced that which must, in time, 
destroy it. The destruction would 
be because of the weakness of 
the attacked. Drusilla wanted to 
be destroyed through the strength 
of the attacker. The distinction 
was, to her, clear and vital. 

There had to be a way, if only 
she could think of it. 

There was, and she did. 

TTE came onstage grinning like 
a boy, swinging his guitar 
carelessly. The set was a living 
room. He plumped down on a 
one-armed easychair and hooked 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



141 



a brown -and -white hassock toward him with his heel. There 
was applause. 

"Thank you, Mother," said 
Chan Behringer. He slipped the 
plectrum from under the first and 
second strings. Dru thought Four 
low D is one one-hundred-twentyeighth tone sharp. 

Deftly, out of sight of the audience, he plugged in the pickup 
cable. Dru watched attentively. 
She had never seen a twelvestring guitar before. 

He began to play. He played 
competently, with neither mistakes nor imagination. There was 
a five-stage amplifier built into 
his chair and a foot-pedal tone 
control and electronic vibrato in 



the hassock. A rough cutoff at 
twenty-seven thousand cycles, 
she realized, and then remembered that, to most humans, response 
flat to eight thousand is high 
fidelity. 

She was immensely pleased 
with the electrical pickups; she 
had not noticed them at first, 
which was a compliment to him. 
One was magnetic, sunk into the 
fingerboard at the fourteenth fret. 
The other was a contact microphone, obviously inside the box, 
directly under the bridge. The 
either-or-both switch was audible 
when he moved it, which she 
thought disgraceful. 

He finished his number, drawled a few lines of patter, asked for 




142 




 



and played a couple of requests 
and an encore, by which time 
Drusilla had left the theater and 
was talking to the stage doorman. 
He took the paper parcel she 
handed him and sent it to the 
dressing rooms via the callboy. 

In a matter of seconds, there 
was a wild whoop from backstage 
and Chan Behringer came bounding down the iron steps, clutching a wild flannel shirt, a pair of 
blue dungarees, and some tatters 
of paper and string. 

"Dru! Dru!" he gasped. He ran 
to her, his arms out. 'Then he 
stopped, faltered, put his head 
very slightly to one side. "Dru," 
he said again, softly. 

"Hello, Chan." 

"I never thought I'd see you 
again." 

"I had to return your things." 

"Too good to be true," he murmured. "I — we — " Suddenly 
he turned to the goggling doorman 
and tossed the clothes to him. 
"Hang on to these for me, will 
you, George?" To Drusilla he 
said, "I should take 'em backstage, but I'm afraid to let you 
out of my sight." 

"I won't run away again." 

"Let's get out of here," he said. 
He took her arm, and again there 
was the old echo of a shock he 
had once felt at the touch of her 
flesh through fabric. 

They went to a place, all soft 
lights and leather, and they talk


ed about the beach and the city 
and show business and guitar 
music, but not about her strange 
fury with him the morning she 
had stalked out of his life. 

"You've changed," he said at 
length. 

"Have I?" 

"You were like — like a queen 
before. Now you're like a princess." 

"That's sweet." 

"More . .' . human." 

She laughed. "I wasn't exactly 
human when you first met me. 
I'd had a bad time. I'm all right 
now, Chan. I — didn't want to 
see you until I was all right." 

They talked until it was time 
for his next act, and after that 
they had dinner. 

She saw him the next day, and 
the next. 

^T^HE chubby man with a face 
like a cobbler and hands like 
a surgeon made the most beautiful guitars in the world. He 
sprang to his feet when the tall 
girl came in. It was the first time 
he had paid such a courtesy in 
fourteen years. 

"Can you cut an F-slot that 
looks like this?" she demanded. 

He looked at the drawing she 
laid on the counter, grunted, then 
said, "Sure, lady. But why?" 

She launched into a discussion 
which, at first, he did not hear, 
for it was in his field and in his 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



143 



language and he was too astonished to think. But once into it, 
he very rapidly learned things 
about resonance, harmonic reinforcement, woods, varnishes and 
reverse-cantilever designs that 
were in no book he had ever 
heard about. 

When she left a few minutes 
later, he hung gasping to the 
counter. In front of him was a 
check for work ordered. In his 
hand was a twenty-dollar bill for 
silence. In his mind was a flame 
and a great wonderment. 

She spilled a bottle of nailpolish remover on Chan's guitar. 
He was kind and she was pathetically contrite. It was all right, he 
said; he knew a place that could 
retouch it before evening. They 
went there together. The little 
man with the cobbler's face handed over the new instrument, a 
guitar with startling slots, an 
ultra -precision bridge, a fingerboard that crept into his hand as 
if it were alive and loved him. He 
chorded it once, and at the tone 
he put it reverently down and 
stared. His eyes were wet. 

"It's yours," Drusilla twinkled. 
"Look — your name inlaid on the 
neck-back." 

"I know your guitars," said 
Chan to the chubby man, "but 
I never heard of anything like 
this." 

"Tricks to every trade," said 
the man, and winked. 



Drusilla slipped him another 
twenty as they left. 

rwiHE electronics engineer stared 
at the schematic diagram. "It 
won't work." 

"Yes, it will," said Drusilla. 
"Can you build it?" 

"Well, gosh, yes, but who ever 
heard of voltage control like 
this? Where's the juice supposed 
to go from . . ." He leaned closer. 
"Well, I'll be damned. Who designed this?" 

"Build it," she said. 

He did. It worked. Drusilla 
wired it into the prop armchair 
and Chan never knew anything 
had been changed. He attributed 
everything to the new instrument 
as he became more familiar with 
it and began to exploit its possibilities. Suddenly there were no 
more layoffs. No more road trips, 
either. The clubs began to take 
important notice of the shy young 
man with the tear -your- heart- out 
guitar. 

She stole his vitamin pills and 
replaced them with something 
else. She invited him to dinner at 
her apartment and he fainted in 
the middle of the fish course. 

He came to seven hours later 
on the couch, long after the 
strange induction baker and the 
rack of impulse hypodermics had 
been hidden away. He remembered absolutely nothing. He was 
lying on his left arm and it ached. 



144 




 




ORUSILLA STRANGE

Dru told him he had fallen 
asleep and she had just let him 
sleep it out. 

"Poor dear, you've been working too hard." 

He told her somewhat harshly 
that she must never let him sleep 
like that, cutting off the circulation in his fingering arm. 

The next day, the arm was 
worse and he had to cancel a 
date. On the third day, it was 
back to normal, one hundred per 
cent, and on the fourth, fifth, and 
sixth days it continued to improve. And what it could do on 
the fingerboard was past description. Which was hardly surprising: there was not another arm on 
Earth like it, with its heavier 
nerve-fibers, the quadrupling of 
the relay-nodes on the medullary 
sheaths, the low-resistance, superreactive axones, and the isotopic 
potassium and sodium which 
drenched them. 

"I don't play this damn thing 
any more," he said. "I just think 
the stuff and that left hand reads 
my mind." 

IIE made three records in three 
months, and the income from 
them increased cubically each 
time. Then the record company 
decided to save money and put 
him under a long-term contract 
at a higher rate than anyone had 
ever been paid before. 

Chan, without consulting Dru


silla, bought one of a cluster of 
very exclusive houses just over 
the city line. The neighbors on 
the left were the Kerslers, whose 
grandfather had made their money in off-the-floor sanitary fixtures. The neighbors on the right 
were the Mullings — you know, 
Osprey Mullings, the writer, two 
books a year, year in and year 
out, three out of four of them 
making Hollywood. 

Chan invited the Kerslers and 
the Mullings to his housewarming, and took Drusilla out there 
to surprise her. 

She was surprised, all right. 
Kersler had a huge model railroad in his cellar and his mind 
likewise contained a great many 
precise minutiae, only one of 
which was permitted to operate 
at a time. Grace Kersler's mind 
was like an empty barn solidly 
lined with pink frosting. Osprey 
Mullings* head contained a set 
of baby's blocks of limited number, with which he constructed his 
novels by a ritualistic process of 
rearrangement. But Luellen 
Mullings was the bland-faced 
confection who secretly chewed 
bubble gum and who had so jolted Drusilla that day on the 
beach road. 

It was a chatty and charming 
party, and it was the very first 
time that humans had been capable of irritating Drusilla so much 
that she had to absorb the an


146 




 



noyance rather than ignore it. 
She bore this attack on her waning capacities with extreme graciousness, and at parting, the 
Kerslers and the Mullings pressed 
Chan's hand and wished him luck 
with that beautiful Drusilla 
Strange, you lucky fellow you. 

And late at night, full to bursting with success and security and 
a fine salting of ambition, Chan 
drove her back to town and at 
her apartment, he proposed to 
her. 

She held both his hands and 
cried a little, and promised to 
work with him and to help him 
even more in the future — but, 
"Please, please, Chan, never ask 
me that again." 

He was hurt and baffled, but 
he kept his promise. 

^^HAN studied music seriously 
now — he never had before. He 
had to. He was giving concerts 
rather than performances, and he 
played every showcase piece ever 
composed by one virtuoso to 
madden and frustrate the others. 
He played all of the famous violin cadenzi on his guitar as well. 
He made arrangements of the 
arrangements. He did all this 
with the light contempt of a 
Rubinstein examining a two dollar lesson in chord-vamping. So 
at length he had no recourse but 
to compose. Some of his stuff was 
pretty advanced. All of it took 

DRUSILLA STRANGE 



you by the throat and held you. 

One Sunday afternoon, "Try 
this," said Drusilla. She hummed 
a tone or two, then burst into a 
cascade of notes that brought 
Chan up standing. 

"God, Dru!" 

"Try it," she said. 

He got his guitar. His left hand 
ran over the fingerboard like a 
perplexed little animal, and he 
struck a note or two. 

"No," she said, "this." She 
sang. 

"Oh," he whispered. Watching 
her, he played. When she seemed 
not pleased, he stopped. 

"No," she said. "Chan, I can 
only sing one note at a time. You 
have twelve strings." She paused, 
thoughtfully, listening. "Chan, if 
I asked you to play that theme, 
and then to — to paint pictures on 
it with your guitar, would that 
make sense?" 

"You usually make sense." 

She smiled at him. "All right. 
Play that theme, and with it, play 
the way a tree grows. Play the 
way the bud leads the twig and 
the twig cuts up into space to 
make a hole for the branch. No," 
she said quickly, as his eyes 
brightened and his right thumb 
and forefinger tightened on the 
plectrum, "not yet. There's more." 

He waited. 

She closed her eyes. Almost inaudibly, she hummed something. 
Then she said, "At the same time, 

147 



put in all the detail of a tree that 
has already grown." She opened 
her eyes and looked straight at 
him. "That will consolidate," she 
said factually, "because a tree is 
only the graphic trajectory of its 
buds." 

He looked at her strangely. 
"You're quite a girl." 

"Never mind that," she said 
quickly. "Now put those three 
things together with a fountain. 
And that's all." 

"What kind of a fountain?" 

She paled, but her voice was 
easy. "Silly. The only kind of 
fountain that could be with that 
theme, the tree growing, and the 
tree grown." 

He struck a chord. "I'll try." 

She hummed for him, then 
brought one long forefinger down. 
He picked up the theme from her 
voice. He closed his eyes. The 
guitar, of all instruments the most 
intimately expressive, given a 
magic sostenuto by its electronic 
graft, began to speak. 

The theme, the tree growing, 
the tree grown. 

Suddenly, the fountain, too. 

What happened then left them 
both breathless. Music of this 
nature should never be heard in 
a cubic volume smaller than its 
subject. 

When the pressured stridency 
of the music was quite gone, 
Chan looked at a cracked window pane and then turned to 



watch a talc-fine trickle of plaster 
dust stream down from the lintel 
of the french window. 

"Where," he said, shaken, "did 
you get that little jangle?" 

"Thin air, darling," said Drusilla blithely. "All the time, everywhere, whenever you like. 
Listen." 

TJE cocked his head. There was 
an intense silence. His left 
hand crept up to the frets and 
spattered over them. In spite of 
the fact that he had not touched 
the strings with his right hand, 
a structure of sound hung in the 
room, reinforcing itself, holding, 
holding . . . finally dying. 

"That it?" he asked, awed. 

She held up a thumb and forefinger very close together. "About 
so much of it." 

"How come I never heard it 
before?" 

"You weren't ready." 

His eyes suddenly filled with 
tears. "Damn it, Drusilla . . . 
you're — you've done . . . Oh, hell, 
I don't know, I love you so 
much." 

She touched his face. "Shh. 
Play for me, Chan." 

He breathed hard, thickly. 
"Not in here." 

He put down his guitar and 
went to get the portable amplifier. They set it upon the rolling 
lawn and plugged in the guitar. 
Chan held the instrument for a 



148 




 



silent moment, sliding his hand 
over its polished flank. He looked 
up suddenly and met Drusilla's 
eyes. Chan's face twisted, for her 
ecstasy and gaiety and triumph 
added up to something very like 
despair, and he did not understand. 

He would have thrown down 
the guitar then, for his heart was 
full of her, but she backed away, 
shaking her head lightly, and bent 
to the amplifier to switch it on. 
Her fingers pulled at the rotary 
switch as she turned it, and only 
she knew the nature of the mighty 
little transmitter that began to 
warm up along with the audio. 
She moved back still further; 
she did not want to be close to 
him when it — happened. 

He watched her for a moment, 
then looked down at the guitar. 
He watched his four enchanted 
left fingers hook and hover over 
the fingerboard ; he looked at 
them with a vast puzzlement that 
slowly turned to raptness. He 
began to sway gently. 

Drusilla stood tall and taut, 
looking past him to the trees, to 
the scudding clouds and beyond. 
She dropped her shields and let 
the music pour in. And from the 
guitar came a note, another, two 
together, a strange chord. For this 
I sha// be killed, she thought. To 
bring to the mighty scorn her 
people had of Earth and all 
things Earthly, this molded sav


age who could commune like a 
Citizen . . . this was the greatest 
affront. 

A foam of music fell and 
feathered and rushed inward to 
the Fountainhead Itself, and every voice of it smashed and 
hurtled upward. The paired sixth 
strings of the guitar flung up with 
them in a bullroar gltssando that 
broke and spread glistening all 
over the keyboard, falling and 
falling away from a brittle high 
spatter of doubled first strings 
struck just barely below the 
bridge, metallic and nccdly; and 
if those taut strings were tied to 
a listener's teeth, they could not 
be more intimate and shocking. 

The unique sound box found 
itself in sudden shrill resonance, 
and it woke the dark strings, the 
deep and mighty ones. They 
thrummed and sang without being touched; and Chan's inhuman fingers found a figure in the 
middle register, folded it in on 
itself, broke it in two, and the 
broken pieces danced . . . and 
still the untouched strings hummed and droned, first one loud 
and then another as the resonances altered and responded. 

And all at once the air was 
filled with the sharp and dusty 
smell of ozone. 

WITH it all, the music, hers 
and Chan's, settled itself 
down and down like some dark 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



giant, pressing and sweeping and 
gathering in its drapes and folds 
as it descended to rest, to collect 
its roaring and crooning and tittering belongings all together 
that they may be piecea and 
piled and understood; until at 
last the monster was settled and 
neat, leaving a looming bulk of 
silence and an undertone of 
pumping life and multi-level 
quiet stripes of contemplation. 
The whole structure breathed, 
slowly and more slowly, held its 
breath, let a tension develop, rising, painful, agonizing, intolerable . . . 

"Play Red River Valley, hey, 
Chan?" 

Drusilla gasped, and the ozone 
rasped her throat. Chan's fingers 
faltered, stopped. He half-turned, 
with a small, interrogative whimper. 

Standing on the other side of 
the far hedge, near her house, was 
Luellen Mullings, her doll-figure 
foiled like a glass diamond in a 
negligible playsuit, her golden 
hair free, her perfect jaw busy on 
her sticky cud. 

There was born in Drusilla a 
fury more feral, more concentrated, than any power of muscle or 
mind she had ever conceived of. 
Luellen Mullings, essence of all 
the degradation Earth was known 
for, all the cheapness, shallowness, ignorance and stupidity. She 
was the belch in the cathedral; 



150 



she would befoul the Fountain 
Itself. 

"Hi, Dm, honey. Didn't see 
you. Hey, I saw a feller at the 
Palace could play guitar holding 
it behind his back." She sniffed. 
"What's that funny smell? Like 
lightning or something." 

"Get back in your house, you 
cheap little slut," Drusilla hissed. 

"Hey, who you calling-—" Luellen dipped down and picked up a 
smooth white stone twice the 
size of her fist. She raised it. Even 
Drusilla's advanced reflexes were 
not fast enough to anticipate what 
she did. The stone left her hand 
like a bullet. Drusilla braced herself — but the stone did not come 
to her. It struck Chan just behind the ear. He pivoted on his 
heel three-quarters of a revolution, and quietly collapsed on the 
grass, the guitar nestling down 
against him like a loving cat. 

"Now look at what you made 
me do!" Luellen cried shrilly. 

Drusilla uttered a harpy's 
scream and bounded across the 
lawn, her long hands spread out 
like talons. Luellen watched her 
come, round-eyed. 

There is a force in steady eyes 
by which a tiger may be made to 
turn away. It can make a strong 
man turn and run. There is a 
way to gather this force into a 
deadly nubbin and hurl it like a 
grenade. Drusilla knew how to 
do this, for she had done it be


fore; she had killed with it. But 
the force she hurled at Luellen 
Mullings now was ten times what 
she had dealt the Preceptor. 

T7*OR a moment, the Universe 
went black, and then Drusilla 
became aware of a pressure on 
her face. There was another sensation, systemic, pervasive. Her 
legs, her arms, were weighted and 
tingly, and she seemed to have no 
torso at all. 

She gradually understood the 
sensation on her face. Moist 
earth and grass. She was lying 
on her stomach on the lawn. She 
absorbed this knowledge as if it 
were a complicated matrix of 
ideas which, if comprehended, 
might lead to hitherto unheard-of 
information. At last she realized 
what was wrong with her body. 
Oxygen starvation. She began to 
breathe again, hard, painful 
gasps, inflations that threatened 
to burst the pulmonary capillaries, exhalations that brought 
her diaphragm upward until it 
crushed in panic against the 
pounding cardium. 

She moved feebly, pulled a 
limp hand toward her, rested a 
moment with it flat on the grass 
near her shoulder. She began to 
press herself upward weakly, failed, rested a moment, and tried 
again. At last she raised herself 
to a sitting position. 

Chan lay where he had fallen.

still as death, guitar nearby. 
Pop! 

Drusilla looked up. Over the 
hedge, like an artificial flower, 
nodded Luellen's bright head. 
The quick deft tongue was retrieving the detritus of a broken 
bubble. 

Drusilla snarled and formed 
another bolt, and as it left her 
something like a huge soft mallet 
seemed to descend on her shoulder-blades. Seated as she was, it 
folded her down until her chest 
struck the ground. Her hip joints 
crackled noisily. She writhed, 
straightened out, lay on her side 
gasping. 

Pop! 

Drusilla did not look up. 

Presently she heard Luellen's 
light footsteps retreating down 
the gravel path. She gave herself 
over to a wave of weakness, and 
relaxed completely to let the 
strength flow back. 

Shh . . . shh . . . approaching 
footsteps. 

Drusilla rolled over and sat up 
again. Her head felt simultaneously pressured and fragile, as if 
any sudden move would make it 
burst like a faulty boiler. She 
turned pain-blinded eyes to the 
footsteps. When the jagged ache 
receded, she saw Luellen sauntering toward her on this side of the 
hedge, swinging her hips, humming tunelessly. 

"Feeling better, honey?" 



Drusilla glared at her. The 
killer-bolt began to form again. 
Luellen sank gracefully to the 
grass, near but not too near, and 
chose a grass-stem to pull up. 

"I wouldn't if I were you, hon," 
she said pleasantly. "I can keep 
this up all day. You*re just knocking yourself out." 

She regarded the grass stem 
thoughtfully from her wide vacant eyes, poked out a membrane 
of gum, hesitated a moment, and 
drew it back in without blowing 
a bubble. The gum clicked wetly 
twice as she worked it. 

"Damn you," said Drusilla devoutly. 

¥ UELLEN giggled. Drusilla 
struggled upward, leaned 
heavily on one arm, and glared. 
Luellen said, without looking at 
her, "That's far enough, sweetie." 

"Who are you?" Drusilla whispered. 

"Home makuh," said Luellen, 
with a trace of Bronx accent. 
"Leisure class type home makuh." 

"You know what I mean," Drusilla growled. 

"Whyn't you look and see?" 

Drusilla curled her lip. 

"Don't want to get your pretty 
probes dirty, huh? Know what 
you are? You're a snob." 

"A — a what?" 

"Snob," said Luellen. She 
stretched prettily. "Just too good 
for anybody. Too good for him." 



DRUSILLA STRANGE 



153 



She pointed to Chan with a gesture of her head. "Or me." She 
shrugged. "Anybody." 

Drusilla glanced at Chan and 
probed anxiously. 

"He's all right," said Luellen. 
"Just unplugged." 

Drusilla swung her attention 
back to the other girl. Reluctantly she dropped her automatic 
shield and reached out with her 
mind. What are you? 

Luellen put her hands out, 
palms forward. "Not that way. I 
don't do that any more. Look if 
you want to, but if you want to 
talk to me, talk out loud." 

Drusilla probed. "A criminal!" 
she said finally, in profound disgust. 

"Sisters under the skin," said 
Luellen. She popped her gum. 
Drusilla shuddered. Luellen said, 
"Tell you what I did." 

"I'm not interested." 

"Tell you, anyway. Listen," 
Luellen said suddenly, "you 
know if you try to do anything 
to me, you'll go flat on your 
bustle. Well, the same thing applies if you don't listen to me. 
Hear?" 

Drusilla dropped her eyes and 
was furiously silent. Reluctantly 
she realized that this creature 
could do exactly as she said. 

"I'm not asking you to like it," 
Luellen said more gently. "Just 
listen, that's all." 

She waited a moment, and 



when Drusilla offered nothing, 
she said, "What I did, I climbed 
over the wall at school." 

Drusilla gasped. "You went 
outside?" 

Luellen rolled over onto her 
stomach and propped herself on 
her elbows. She pulled another 
blade of grass and broke it. 
"Something funny happened to 
me. You know the feeling-picture 
about jumping?" 

Drusilla recognized it instantly, the sweet, strong, breathless 
sensation of being strong and 
leaping from soft grass, floating, 
landing lithely. 

"You do," said Luellen, glancing at Drusilla's face. "Well, I 
was having that picture one fine 
morning when it — srucA. J mean 
like one of the phonograph records here when it gets stuck. 
There I was feeling a jump. Just 
off the ground, and it all froze." 

SHE laughed a little. "I was 
real scared. After a while, it 
started again. I went and asked 
my tutor about it. She got all 
upset and went to the Preceptor. 
He called me in and there was no 
end of hassel about it." Again she 
laughed. "I'd have forgotten the 
whole thing if he hadn't made 
such a fuss. He wanted me to forget it in the worst way. Tried to 
make me think it happened because there was something wrong 
with me. 



154 




 



"So I got to thinking about it. 
When you do that, you start looking pretty carefully at all the 
pictures. And you know, they're 
full of scratches and flaws, if 
you look. 

"But all the time they were 
teaching us that this was the 
world over the Wall — perfect 
green grass, beautiful men, the 
fountain and the falls and all the 
rest of it, that we were supposed 
to graduate to when the time 
came. I wondered so much that 
I wouldn't wait any more. So I 
went over the wall. They caught 
me and sent me here." 

"I don't wonder," said Drusilla 
primly. 

Luellen put pink fingers to her 
lips, hauled the gum out almost 
to arm's length, and chewed it 
back in as she talked. "And all 
you did was knock off the Preceptor!" 

Drusilla winced and said nothing. 

Luellen said, "You been here 
about two years, right? How 
many of us prisoners have you 
run into?" 

"Nonet" said Drusilla, with 
something like indignation. "I 
wouldn't have anything to do 
with — " She clamped her lips 
tight and snorted through her 
nostrils. "Will you srop that giggling?" 

"I can't help it," said Luellen. 
"It's part of the pattern for home 



makuhs. All home makuhs giggle." 

". . . And that voice!" 

"That's part of the pattern too, 
hon," said Luellen. "How do you 
think I'd go over at the canasta 
table if I weren't a-flutter and atwitter, all coos and sighs and 
gentle breathings? My God, the 
girls'd be scared right out of their 
home permanents!" She tittered 
violently. 

"Again!" Drusilla winced. 

"You might as well get used to 
it, hon. I had to. You'll be doing 
something equally atrocious yourself, pretty soon. It goes under 
the head of camouflage . . . Look, 
I'll stop fooling around. There's 
a couple of hard truths you have 
to get next to. I know what you 
did. You set up a reflex to blank 
out any ex-Citizen you might 
meet. Right?" 

"One must keep oneself decent," insisted Drusilla. 

T UELLEN shook her head 
wonderingly. "You're just 
dumb, girl. I don't like you, but 
I have to be sorry for you." 

"I don't need your pity!" 

"Yes, you do. You've been 
asleep for a whole lot of years 
and you just have to snap out of 
it." Luellen knelt and sat back 
on her heels. "Tell me — up to 
the time they shipped you here, 
where did you go?" 

"You know perfectly well. The 



DRUSILLA STRANGE

Great Hall. My garden. My dormitory. That's all." 

"Um-hmm. That's all. And every minute since you were born, 
you've been conditioned: a Citizen is the finest flower of creation. 
Be a good obedient girl and you'll 
gambol on the green for the rest 
of your life. Meanwhile there are 
criminals who get sent to prison, 
and the prison is the lowest cesspool in the Universe where you 
live out your life being reminded 
of the glory of the world you 
lost." 

"Of course, but you make it 
sound — " 

"Did you ever see any of those 
big muscular beautiful men the 
pictures told you about? Did you 
ever see that old-granite and newgrass landscape, or get warm 
under that nice big sun?" 

"No, I was sent here before I 
had—" 

Luellen demonstrated her ties 
to Earth by uttering a syllable 
which was, above all else, Earthy. 
"You're the dumbest blind kitten 
I ever saw. And tell me, when 
they took you to the ship, did 
you get a chance to look around?" 

"I wasn't . . . worthy," said 
Drusilla miserably. "If a — a 
criminal was privileged to see 
outside the Wall — " 

"They blindfolded you. Yes, 
and you never got a chance to 
look out of the ship when it left, 
either. Look, Citizen," she said 



scornfully, "if you hadn't had 
the good sense to get yourself sent 
here, you never would have gotten over the Wall!" 

"I had only six more years before I — " 

"Before you'd be quietly moved 
to another Walled Place with 
your age group. And maybe 
you'd have been bred, and maybe not, and by the time you realized there was no release for 
you, you'd be so old you wouldn't 
care any more. And they call that 
a world and this a prison!" 

Drusilla suddenly put her 
hands over her ears. "I won't 
listen to this! I won't!" 

Luellen grasped her wrist in a 
remarkably powerful little hand. 
"Yes, by God, you will," she 
said between her perfect teeth. 
"Our race is old and dying, rotten to the core. Know why you 
never saw any men ? Because 
there are only a few hundred of 
them left. They lie in their cubicles and get fat and breed. And 
most of their children are girls, 
because that's the way it was arranged so long ago that we've 
forgotten how it was done or how 
to change it. You know what's 
over the Wall? Nothing! It's an 
ice-world, with a dying sun and 
thinning air, and a little cluster 
of Walled Places to breed women 
for the men to breed with, and a 
few old, old, worn transmitters 
for music and pictures to condi

tion the blindworms who live and 
die there!" 

■"JRUSILLA began to cry. Luellen sat back and watched 
her, a great softness coming into 
her eyes. 

"Cry, that's good, sweetie," she 
said huskily. "Ah, you poor brat. 
You could've gotten straightened 
out the day you arrived. But no. 
Criminals were the lowest of the 
low, and you wouldn't associate 
with them. Earth and humans 
were insects and savages, because 
that's what you were taught. To 
be a Citizen was to be a god 
among gods, and to hear the 
music was your torture, for what 
you'd lost." 

"What about the torture?" 

"Transmitters in the^ guardian 
ships. You know about that." 

"But the Citizens on board 
them — " 

"What? Oh, for Pete's sake, 
hon ! They're machines, that's 
all." 

"They're not! The killer-boats 
are — " 

"The killer-boats home on any 
human mind that begins to operate near the music bands. You 
had a close call, kitten." 

"I wish one had come," Drusilla said miserably. "That's what 
I wanted." 

"One did come, silly. But I 
don't get you. What did you 
want?" 

DRUSILLA STRANGE 



"I wanted it to kill me. That's 
why I taught Chan to—" 

Luellen clapped her hands to 
her face. "I thought that, but I 
couldn't really believe it! Sweetie, 
I got news for you. That boat 
wouldn't have killed you. It was 
after your boy-friend there." 

Drusilla's face went almost as 
white as her teeth. She put her 
fist to her mouth and bit it, her 
eyes round, full of horror. 

"It's all right," Luellen murmured. "It's gone. It was homing 
on him, and when he stopped radiating, it stopped coming. It's 
just a machine." 

"You stopped it," Drusilla 
breathed. Slowly she sat up 
straight, staring at the little 
blonde as if she had never seen 
her before. 

"Pity if one of us couldn't outthink a machine," said Luellen 
deprecatingly. Then, "What is it, 
Dru? What's the matter?" 

"He might have been . . . 
killed." 

"You only just thought of that. 
Really thought of it." 

Drusilla nodded. 

"I'll bet this is the first time 
you ever thought of someone 
else. See what snobbery can do?" 

"I feel awful." 

T UELLEN laughed at her. 
* J "You feel fine. Or you will. 
What you've got is an attack of 
something called humility. It 



rushes in to fill the hole when the 
snobbery is snatched out. You'll 
be all right now." 

"Will I?" She licked her lips. 
She tried to speak and could not. 
She pointed a wavering finger at 
the unconscious man. 

"Him?" Luellen answered the 
unspoken question. "Just you 
keep him asleep for a while. Give 
him more music, but keep him 
away from that." She pointed to 
the sky. "He won't know the difference." 

"Humility," said Drusilla, 
thoughtfully. "That's when you 
feel . . . not good enough. Is that 
it?" 

"Something like that." 

"Then I don't ... I don't think 
I understand. Lu, do you know 
why I killed the Preceptor?" 

Luellen shook her head. "It 
was a good idea, whatever." 

Drusilla said with difficulty, 
"My group went to be chosen for 
breeding. There's a — custom that 
the . . . ugliest girl must be sent 
back to her garden. H-he pointed 
me out. I was the ugliest one 
there. He said I was the ugliest 
woman in the world. I went . . . 
kind of . . . crazy, I guess. I 
killed him." 

Suddenly she was in Luellen's 
strong small arms. "Oh, for God's 
sake," said Luellen with a roughness that made Drusilla cry 
again. "You're the sorriest most 
mixed-up little chicken ever. 



Don't you know that a perfect 
necklace has to have an ugliest 
diamond in it somewhere?" She 
thumped Drusilla's heaving 
shoulder. "We've been bred for 
beauty for more generations than 
this Earth has years, Dru. On 
Earth you're one of the most 
beautiful women alive." 

"He told me that once, and I 
could have . . . killed him," Drusilla squeaked. She swallowed 
hard, moved back to peer piteously into Luellen's face. "Is 
that humility? To feel you're not 
good enough?" 

"That's humiliation," said Luellen. She paused thoughtfully. 
"And here's the difference: Humility is knowing something is 
finer and better than you can ever 
be, so it's, worth putting everything you have behind that something. Everything! Like . . ." 

She laughed. "Like me and 
that ham novelist of mine. Bit by 
bit, year by year, he gets better. 
I give him exactly what he needs, 
in his own time. Right now what 
he wants is an irresponsible little 
piece of candy he can pick up or 
put down, and meantime get envied all over the neighborhood 
for. He's got it in him to do some 
really important work some day, 
and when he does he'll need 
something else from me, and I'll 
be here to give it to him. If, fifty 
years from now, he comes doddering up to me and tells me I've 



158 




 



grown with him through the 
years. I'll know I did the thing 
right." 

Drusilla worried at the statement, turning it over, shaking it. 
She parted her lips, closed them 
again. 

Luellen said, "Go ahead. Ask 
me." 

TAR US ILL A looked to her timidly, dropped her eyes. "Is 
he really finer and better?" 

"Snob!" said Luellen, and this 
time it was all kindliness. "Of 
course! He's an Earthman, Dru. 
Earth is young and crude and 
raw, but it's strong and it's good. 
Do you call an infant stupid because it can't talk, or is a child 
bad because it hasn't learned 
reason? We have nothing but decadence to bring to Earth. So instead we help Earth with the best 
it has. You keep your eyes open 
from now on, Dru. Nine women 
out of ten who truly help their 
men to realize themselves are 



what you've been calling criminals. 

"You'll find them all over, up 
and down the social scale, through 
and through the history of this 
culture. Put up your shields 
again — for fun — and watch the 
women you meet. See how some 
seem to understand one another 
on sight — how they pass a glance 
that seems to be full of secrets. 
They're the hope of the world, 
Dru darling, and this world is 
the hope of the Galaxy." She followed Drusilla's gaze and smiled. 
"Now that you come to think of 
it, you love him. don't you?" 

"Now that I come to think of 
it . . ." 

She raised her head and looked 
at the sky. Gradually a smile was 
born on her trembling lips. She 
shook herself and took a deep 
breath of the warm evening air. 

"Listen," she said. She laughed 
unevenly. It is sort of scratchy, 
isn't it?"
