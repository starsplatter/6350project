IRONCLAD By ALGIS BUDRYS 


COTTRELL Slade Garvin 
was twenty-six and had 
been, technically at any 
rate, a sex criminal for three 
years, when his mother called 
him into her parlor and explained why she could not introduce 
him to the girl on whom he'd 
been spying. 

"Cottrell, darling," she said, 
laying her delicately veined hand 
on his sun-darkened fist, "you 
understand I think Barbara is 
a fine girl — one whom any young 
man of your class and station 
would ordinarily be honored to 
meet and, in due course of time, 
betroth. But surely you will admit that her family — " there was 
the faintest inhalation through 
the fragile nose — "particularly 
on the male side, is not one which 
could be accepted into our own." 
Her expression was genuinely regretful. 

"More explicitly, her father's 
opinion on the proper conduct of 
a domicile . . ." The sniff was 
more audible. "Then too, his behavior in accord with that opinion is such that our entire family 
would be embroiled in an endless 
series of affairs of Integrity. You, 
yourself, would be forced to bear 
the brunt of these encounters, as 
well as the responsibility of defending the notoriously untenable 
properties which Mr. Holland 
pleases to designate as Barbara's 
dowry. 

"No, Cottrell, I fear that, much 
as this match may appeal to you 
superficially, you must realize 
that the responsibilities entailed 
would more than offset any possible benefits." Her hand patted 
his lightly. "I'm sorry." A tear 
sparkled in each eye, and it was 
obvious that the discussion had 
been a great strain upon her, for 
she genuinely loved her son. 

Cottrell sighed. "All right, 
Mother," he said. There was 
nothing more he could do at 
this time. "But should circum


stances change you will reconsider, won't you?" he asked. 

HIS mother smiled and nodded, as she said, "Of course, 
Cottrell." But then the smile faded. "However, it does seem rather 
unlikely, doesn't it? Are there 
no other young ladies . . .?" At 
his expression, the smile returned, 
and her voice became reassuring. 
"Well, we'll see, we'll see." 

"Thank you, Mother." At 
least, he had that much. He rose 
from his chair and kissed her 
cheek. "I have to make sure the 
cows have all been stalled." 

With a final smile he left her, 
hurrying across the yard to the 
barn. The cows were all attended 
to, of course, but he stayed in 
the barn, driving his work-hardened fist into a grain sack again 
and again, while sweat beaded 
his forehead. 

Feeling slightly ill, he gently 
closed the barn door behind him 
and sensed from the hues of the 
sunset and the feel of the wind 
that it would be a clear night. 
The realization filled him with 
equal parts of guilt and anticipation. 

rw^HE temperature was just 
right and the dew had left a 
perfect leavening of dampness in 
the darkness. Cott let the false 
door close quietly behind him 
and slipped noiselessly across the 



78 




 



moist lawn at an angle that 
brought him out on the clay 
road, precisely at the point where 
his property ended and Mr. Holland's began. 

He walked through the darkness with gravel shifting under 
his moccasins, his bandoleer 
bumping gently against his body, 
with the occasional feel of oily 
metal against his cheek as the 
carbine, slung from his shoulder, 
touched him with its curved 
magazine. It was a comforting 
sensation — his father had felt it 
before him, and his father's father. It had been the mark of a 
free man for each of them. 

When he had come as close to 
Mr. Holland's house as he could 
without disturbing the dog, he 
slid into the ditch that ran beside 
the road. Cradling his carbine in 
the crooks of his bent arms, he 
belly-crawled silently and rapidly as close to the house as the 
ditch would take him. 

He raised his head from behind 
a clump of weeds he had planted 
during a spring rainstorm and, 
using this as cover, scanned the 
front of the house. For any of 
this to be possible without the 
dog's winding him, the breeze had 
to be just right. On this night, it 
was. 

The parlor window — perhaps 
the only surface-level parlor window in this area, he thought — 
was lighted, and she was in the 



room. Cott checked the sharp 
sound of his breath and sank his 
teeth against his lower lip. He 
kept his hands carefully away 
from the metalwork of his carbine, for his palms were sweaty. 

He waited until, finally, she 
put out the light and went downstairs to bed. Then he dropped his 
head on his folded arms for a 
moment, eyes closed and breath 
irregular, before he twisted 
around and began to crawl back 
up the ditch. 

Tonight, so soon after what his 
mother had said, he was shocked, 
but not truly surprised, to discover that his vision was badly 
blurred. 

He reached the point where it 
was safe to leave the ditch and 
stood up quietly. He put one foot 
on the road and sprang up to the 
clay surface with the agility of 
young muscles. There was no 
warning of a darker shadow 
among the dappled splotches 
thrown by roadside weeds and 
bushes. 

Mr. Holland calmly said, "Hi, 
boy." 

T OWERING his shoulder, Cott 
" was ready to let the carbine 
he had just reslung slide down 
his arm into his hand. He stood 
motionless, peering at Holland, 
who had stepped up silently. 

"Mr. Holland!" 

The old man chuckled. 



IRONCLAD 



"Weren't expecting me, huh?" 

Cott took a measure of relief 
from the man's obvious lack of 
righteous anger. "Good — uh — 
good evening, sir," he mumbled. 
Apparently he was not going to 
die immediately, but there was 
no telling what was going on in 
his neighbor's mind. 

"Guess I was right about that 
patch of weeds springing up kind 
of sudden." Holland said. 

Cott felt the heat rush into 
his ears, but he said, "Weeds, 
sir?" 

"Pretty slick. You got the 
makings of a damn good combat 
man." 

Cott was thankful for the darkness, as one embarrassment was 
replaced by another. The lack 
of light, however, did not keep 
his voice from betraying more 
than it should. Holland's implication had been clear. "My 
family, sir, prefers not to acknowledge former members who 
have sunk below their station. 
You will understand that under 
differing circumstances, I might 
thus consider your remark to be 
not flattering." 

Holland chuckled. "No insult 
intended, son. There was a time 
when a guy like you wouldn't 
have stopped strutting for a 
week, after a pat on the back like 
that." 

Cott could still feel the heat in 
his cheeks, and its cause over



 



rode his sharp sense of the incongruity of this midnight debate, 
a completely illogical circumstance which any other two men 
would have settled in a normai 
and civilized manner. 

"Fortunately, sir," his voice 
was now at its normal pitch, "we 
no longer live in such times." 

"You don't, maybe." Holland's 
voice was somewhat testy. 

"I sincerely hope not, sir." 

Holland made an impatient 
sound. "Boy, your Uncle Jim 
was the best damned rifleman 
that ever took out a patrol. Any 
family that gets snotty notions 
about being better than him . . . 
Oh, mercy/" 

Cott recoiled from the curse. 
"Sir/" 

"Excuse me," Holland said 
sarcastically. "I forgot we're living in refined times. Not too refined, though, for a man to go 
crawling through ditches to sneak 
a look at a gal reading a book!" 
he added with contempt. 

|"<OTT felt adrenalin sweep 
^ through his bloodstream. At 
any moment, Mr. Holland was 
obviously going to exercise his 
right to call an affair of Integrity. 
Even while he formulated the 
various points for and against a 
right on his part to defend himself, even if surprised in so palpably immoral an action, his 
reflexes let the carbine slip down 



his shoulder and hang precariously from the sling which, 
despite careful oiling, now gave 
a perverse creak. Cott set his 
teeth in annoyance. 

"I haven't got a gun on you, 
boy," Mr. Holland said placidly. 
"There's better ways of protecting your Integrity than shooting 
people." 

Cott had long since decided 
that his neighbor — like all the 
old people who had been born 
in the Wild Sixties and grown 
up through the Dirty Years — 
was, to put it politely, unconventional. But the sheer lack of 
common sense about going unarmed into a situation where 
one's Integrity might be molested was more than unconventionality. 

But that was neither here nor 
there. In such a case, the greater 
responsibility in carrying out the 
proprieties was obviously his to 
assume. "Allow me to state the 
situation clearly, sir," he said, 
"in order that there be no misunderstanding." 

"No misunderstanding, son. 
Not about this situation, anyway. 
Hell, when I was your — " 

"Nevertheless," Cott interposed, determined not to let Mr. 
Holland trap himself into a genuine social blunder, "the fact 
remains that I have trespassed 
on your property for a number 
of years — " 



IRONCLAD 



"—for the purpose of peeping 
at Barbara." Holland finished for 
him. "Do me a favor, son?" Holland's voice was slightly touched 
by amusement. 

"Certainly, sir." 

"Lay off the — "Holland caught 
himself. "I mean show a little 
less concern for the social amenities. Ease up on this business of 
doing the right thing, come hell 
or high water. Here — let's sit 
down and let's talk over a few 
things." 

He was neither hung nor pardoned. Cott's nerves had edged 
to the breaking point. 

This final gaucherie was too 
much for him. 

"I'm sorry, sir," he said, his 
voice harsher than he intended, 
"but that's out of the question. 
I suggest you either do your duty 
as head of your family, or else 
acknowledge your unwillingness 
to do so," 

"Why?" 

The question was not as surprising as it might have been, had 
it come at the beginning of this 
fantastic scene. But it served to 
crystalize one point. It was not 
meant as a defiant insult, Cott 
realized. It was a genuine, sincere inquiry. The fact that Holland was incapable of appreciating the answer was proof that 
his mother's advice had been 
correct. Holland was not a gentleman. 



QUITE obviously, there was 
only one course open to him 
now, if he were not to abandon 
all hope for Barbara's hand. Incredible as it might seem, it was 
to answer the question in all 
seriousness, in an attempt to 
force some understanding through 
the long-set habits of Mr. Holland's thinking. 

"I should think it hardly necessary to remind you that a person's Integrity is his most prized 
moral possession. In this particular case, I have violated your 
daughter's Integrity and, as a 
result, that of your family, as 
well." Cott shook his head in the 
darkness. Explain he might, but 
his voice was sign enough of his 
outrage. 

"What's that?" Holland's own 
voice was wearing thin. 
"I beg your pardon, sir?" 
"Integrity, damn it! Give me 
the definition." 

"Everyone knows what Integrity is, sir! That is, everyone 
should know." Cott's temper was 
foaming. 

Holland swore in frustration. 
"Can't verbalize it, but you'll 
cut another man down for it. Or 
expect to be cut down. All right! 
Go ahead, but don't expect me to 
help you make a damned fool 
of yourself." He sighed. "Go on 
home, son. Maybe, in about 
twenty years or so, you'll get up 
enough guts to come and knock 



82 




 



on the door like a man, if you 
want to see Barbara." 

Through the occlusion of his 
almost overwhelming rage, Cott 
realized that now he could not 
say anything further which might 
offend Holland. "I'm certain 
that, if I were to do so, Miss 
Barbara would not receive me," 
he finally managed to say in an 
even voice, gratified at his ability 
to do so. 

"No, she probably wouldn't," 
Holland said bitterly. "She's too 
damn well brought up — thanks 
to those merciful aunts of hers!" 

He turned his back like a 
coward and strode off down the 
road. 

Cott stood alone in the night, 
his hands clenching his bandoleer, grinding the looped cartridges together. Then he turned 
on his heel and loped home. 

II 

^T^HE shadow coming events 
cast before them is pale compared to the umbra they leave 
behind them. It was a full generation since Berendtsen had 
marched his men across the face 
of North America, like a harrow 
that broke the hard root-clumps 
of isolated and fiercely independent survivors, and left the systematized ground ready and 
fertile for civilization's replanting. 



It was two generations since 
men had fought from house to 
house in New York, while snipers 
waited patiently at apartment 
windows for the rich target of 
a man — any man whose knapsack might contain priceless ammunition and perhaps, if the 
hunter was lucky, food looted 
from the canned-goods shelves of 
some not-quite-completely-gutted store. 

It was a full three generations 
since the war nobody won, when 
the grime of Manhattan was replaced by a deadlier dust that 
glowed softly in the night, that 
lurked avidly outside the few 
populated caves which remained 
in the agonized cliffs of Manhattan. 

So Cott, as he ran for the only 
place where there was peace for 
him — toward the Integrity of his 
home — was only four generations 
removed from civilization, from 
the warm glow of light through 
farmhouse windows on soft nights 
in the summertime. But he was 
only three generations removed 
from a frightened, snarling, hunting and looting organism that 
crouched in a corner of its parquet-floored cave and fingered 
the bolt of its ever-present weapon. 

He left his rifle on the family 
arms-rack in the front parlor 
and padded about the surface 
floor, resetting the alarms, inter

83 



rupting himself occasionally, 
muscles tensed as he thought of 
what had happened. The incredible complexity of the problem 
overwhelmed him, presenting no 
clear face which he could attack 
and rationalize logically. 

Primarily, of course, the fault 
was his. He had committed a premeditated breach of Integrity. It 
was in its various ramifications 
that the question lost its clarity. 

He had spied on Barbara Holland repeatedly. Her father had 
become aware of the fact. Tonight, instead of issuing a direct 
challenge, Mr. Holland had lain 
in wait for him. Then, having informed Cott that he was aware of 
his guilt, Mr. Holland not only 
had not done the gentlemanly 
thing, but had ridiculed his expectation of it. Parenthetically, 
the man had insulted Cott and 
his family, and had derided his 
own daughter. He had referred 
to his sisters-in-law in an unbecoming manner which, if made 
public, would have called for a 
bandoleer-flogging at the hands 
of the male members of the female line. 

Nevertheless, whether Mr. Holland was a gentleman or not, 
Cott had been guilty of a serious 
offense. And in Cott's mind, as 
in that of every other human 
being, what had been a twinging 
secret shame shone disastrous 
and disgusting as a public horror. 



Since Holland had refused to 
solve the problem for him in the 
conventional manner, Cott was 
left with his shame. 

Finally, Cott walked noiselessly down to the living quarters, 
uncertain of the degree of his 
guilt and, therefore, the extent 
of his disgrace. Knowing he 
would not be able to sleep no 
matter how long he lay on his 
bed, he fought down that part 
of his mind which recalled glowingly the image of Barbara Holland. 

THOUGHT— but lost. The remembered picture was as 
strong as the others he had placed beside it, beginning with the 
first one five years ago when 
Cott had first passed her window, 
on his return from Graduate 
training. And, though he saw her 
almost daily at the post office or 
store, these special images were 
not obscured by the cold and 
proper aloofness with which she 
surrounded herself when she was 
not — he winced — alone. 

Again, there was the appalling 
problem of Barbara's father. The 
man had been raised in the wild 
immorality and casual circumstances of the Dirty Years. Obviously, he could see nothing 
wrong with what Cott had been 
doing. He had had enough sense 
not to tell anyone else about it — 
thank the good Lord — but, in 



84 




 



some blundering attempt to 
"Get you two kids together," or 
whatever he might call it, what 
would he tell Barbara? 

Dawn came, and Cott welcomed the night's end. 

As head of the family since his 
father's death in an affair of 
Integrity two years before — he 
had, of course, been the Party 
at Grievance — it was Cott's duty 
to plan each day's activities when 
they varied from normal farm 
routine. Today, with all the 
spring work done and the summer chores so light as to be insignificant, he was at loose ends 
— yet he was grateful for this 
opportunity to bury himself in a 
problem with which he had been 
trained to cope. 

He devoted an hour's thinking 
to it and finally fell back on 
what, in retrospect, had been a 
device his father had used. If 
there was nothing else, there was 
always Drill. 

Out of consideration for his 
grandmother's age, he waited until 07:58 before he touched the 
alarm stud. But not even the 
heavy slam of shutters being 
hurled into their places in the 
armor plate of the outer walls, 
the screech of the generator as 
the radar antennae came out of 
their nocturnal half -sleep into 
whirling life, or the clatter of 
the household children firing test 
bursts from their machine guns 



was enough to disturb his brooding. 

The Drill lasted until 10:00. 
By then, it was obvious that the 
household defenses were doing 
everything they were designed for 
and that the members of the 
household knew their assignments perfectly. Even his grandmother's legendary skill with her 
range finder had not grown dull. 
There was a distinct possibility 
that she had memomed the 
range of every likely target in 
the area. That, if true, was not an 
evasion of her duties, but a valuable accomplishment. 

"Very good," Cott said over 
the intercommunications system. 
"All members of the household 
are now free to return to their 
normal duties, except the children, who will report to me for 
training." 

His mother, whose battle station was at the radarscope a few 
feet away from him, smiled her 
approval as she returned the 
switches to Auto Survey. She put 
her hand gently on his forearm 
as he rose from the fire control 
chair. 

"I'm glad, Cottrell — very 
glad," she said, smiling. 

He did not, at first, understand 
what she meant and looked at her 
blankly. 

"I was afraid you might be 
growing neglectful of your duties, 
as so many of our neighbors are 



IRONCLAD 



85 



doing," she explained. "But I 
should not have doubted you." 
Her voice was strongly underlaid 
with pride in him. "Your fiber 
is stronger than that. Why, I 
was even afraid that your disappointment after our little talk 
yesterday might distract you. 
But I was wrong, and you'll 
never know how happy I am that 
you didn't permit it." 

He bent to kiss her, then hurried to the parlor, where the 
children had already assembled 
and taken their weapons out of 
the arms-rack. 

T> Y mid -afternoon, the younger 
children had been excused, 
and only his two oldest brothers 
were out on the practice terrain 
with him. 

"Stay down!" Cott shouted at 
Alister. "You'll never live to 
graduate if you won't learn to 
flatten out at the crest of a rise!" 
He flung his carbine up to his 
cheek and snapped a branch beside his brother's rump to prove 
his point. 

"Now, you." He whirled on 
Geoffrey. "How'd I estimate my 
windage? Quick!" 

"Grass," Geoffrey said laconically. 

"Wrong! You haven't been 
over that ground in two weeks. 
You have no accurate idea -how 
much wind will move that grass 
as much as it's doing." 



"Asked me how you did it," 
Geoffrey pointed out. 

"All right," Cott snapped, 
"score one for you. Now, how 
would you do it?" 

"Feel. Watch me." Geoffrey's 
lighter weapon cracked with a 
noise uncannily like that of the 
branch, which now split at a 
point two inches below where 
Cott's heavy slug had broken it 
off. 

"Have an instinct for it, do 
you?" Cott was perversely glad 
to find an outlet for his annoyance. "Do it again." 

Geoffrey shrugged. He fired 
twice. The branch splintered, and 
there was a shout from Alister. 
Cott blinked at Geoffrey. "You 
put it next to his hand. Guess he 
got some dirt in his face too." 

Cott looked at the point where 
the grass was undulating wildly, 
as Alister tried to roll away under 
its cover. He found time to note 
his brother's clumsiness before 
he said, "You couldn't have seen 
his hand — or anything except the 
top of his rump, for that matter." 

Geoffrey's seventeen -year- old 
face was secretly amused. "I just 
figured, if I was Alis, where 
would I keep my hands? Simple." 

Cott could feel the challenge to 
his pre-eminence as the family's 
fighting man gathering thickly 
about him. "Very good," he said 
coldly. "You have an instinct 
for combat. Now, suppose that 



86 




 



had been a defective cartridge — 
bad enough to tumble to the 
right and kill your brother. What 
then?" 

"I hand-loaded those cases 
myself. Think I'm fool enough 
to trust that ham-handed gunsmith at the store?" Geoffrey 
was impregnable. Cott felt the 
strain of controlling his temper. 

"If you're so good, why don't 
you go off and join the Militia?" 

J"* EOFFREY took the insult 
without expression. "Think 
I'll stick around. You're going to 
need help — if old man Holland 
ever catches you on those little 
moonlight strolls of yours." 

Cott's anger was mounting. 
"What — did — you- — say?" The 
words emerged from his throat 
like bullets. 

"You heard me." Geoffrey put 
a bullet to either side of the 
thrashing Alister, then one above 
and one below. Alister's training 
broke completely and he sprang 
out of the grass and began to 
run, shouts choking his throat. 
"A rabbit," Geoffrey said contemptuously. "Just pure rabbit. 
Me, I've got Uncle Jim's blood, 
but that AHs, he's genuine Mother." He fired again and snapped 
the heel from Alister's shoe. As 
Alister stumbled into the ground, 
Cott's open palm smashed against 
the side of Geoffrey's face. 

Geoff rey took two sideward 



steps and stopped, his eyes wide 
with shock. The gun hung limply 
from his hands. It would still 
be several years before he would 
have raised it. 

"You'll never mention that relative's name again!" Cott said 
thickly. "Not to me, not to anyone else. What's more, you'll 
consider it a breach of Integrity 
if anyone speaks of him in your 
presence. That understood? As 
for your fantasies about myself 
and Mr. Holland, if you mention 
that again, you'll learn there is 
such a thing as a breach of 
Integrity between brothers!" But 
he knew that everything he said 
was as much an admission as a 
shouted confession. He could 
feel the night's sickness seeping 
through his system again, turning his muscles into limp rags 
and sending the blood pounding 
through his ears. 

Geoffrey narrowed his eyes. 
"For a guy that hates armies and 
soldiers, you sure act like a top 
sergeant," he said. He turned 
around and began to stride away, 
then stopped and looked back. 
"And I'd drop you before you 
got the lead out of your pants," 
he added. 

Geoffrey knows, echoed through 
Cott's mind. Geoffrey knows, 
and Mr. Holland found me out. 
How many others? Like a sickening refrain, the thoughts tumbled over and over in his skull. 



IRONCLAD 



87 



while he swung down the road 
with rapid and clumsy strides. 
The coordination of all the muscles of his usually lithe body was 
non-functioning, thanks to the 
shock of what he had learned on 
the practice terrain. 

He pictured Geoffrey, watching 
from a window and snickering as 
Cott crawled along the ditch. 
He seemed to hear Mr. Holland's 
dry chuckle. How many other 
neighbors had, over the last three 
years, seen him? When he 
thought of it, it seemed incredible 
that pure chance had not made 
the entire countryside aware of 
his disgraceful actions. 

But he could not run from it. 
It was not the way a man faced 
situations. He should go to the 
club and watch the faces of the 
men. As they would greet him, 
they'd hide a little hidden 
demon of scorn in their eyes. 

The carbine's butt slapped his 
thigh as he climbed the club 
steps. 

Ill 

TTE could not be sure he had 
found it. Looking down at 
the newly refilled mug of rum, 
he understood this. He could not 
deny that a strange perverse desire to see what was not really 
there might have put an imagined edge on the twinkle in 
Winter's eye, or the undercur


rent of mirth that always accented Olsen's voice. If Hollis 
sneered more than usual, it probably meant nothing more than 
that the man had discovered 
some new quality about himself 
that made him better than his 
fellows. Just probably, probably 
— with nothing certain. Neither 
affirmation nor denial. 

Cott's hand closed around the 
mug, and he scalded his throat 
with the drink. The remembered 
visions of Barbara were attaining 
a greater precision with every 
swallow. 

"Hello, boy." 

Oh, my God! he thought. He 
had forgotten that Holland was 
a member of the club. He watched Mr. Holland slip into the seat 
opposite his and wondered how 
many dry chuckles had accompanied the old man's relating 
last night's events. 

"How do you do, sir," he managed to say, remembering to 
maintain the necessary civilities. 

"Don't mind if I work on my 
liquor at the same table with 
you, do you?" 

Cott shook his head. "Pleasure, 
sir." 

The chuckle came that Cott 
had been expecting. "Say, boy, 
if you'd pour a few slugs into 
you, you'd forget to tack on some 
of that fancy speech." Mr. Holland chuckled again. 

"Guess I got a little sore at 



88 




 



you last night," he went on. 
"Sorry about that. Everybody's 
got a right to live the way they 
want to." 

Cott stared silently into his 
mug. The clarity that had begun to emerge from its depths 
was now unaccountably gone, as 
though Holland's presence was 
enough to plunge him headlong 
back into the mental chaos that 
had strangled his thinking 
through the night and most of 
the day. He was no longer sure 
that Mr. Holland had not kept 
the story to himself. He was no 
longer sure that Geoffrey had 
done more than make a shrewd 
guess ... he was no longer sure 
of anything. 

"Look, boy . . ." 

And the thought came that, 
for the first time since he had 
known him, Mr. Holland was as 
unsure as he. He looked up. saw 
the slow light of uncertainty in 
the man's glance. "Yes, sir?" 

"Boy — I don't know. 1 tried to 
talk to you last night, but I 
guess we were both kind of 
steamed up. Think you'll feel 
more like listening tonight? Particularly if I choose my words 
a little carefully?" 

"Certainly, sir." That, at least, 
was common courtesy. 

"Well, look — I was a friend of 
your Uncle Jim's." 

Cott bristled. "Sir, I . . ." He 
stopped. In a sense, he was obli


gated to Mr. Holland. If he 

didn't say it now, it would have 
to be said later. "Sorry, sir, 
please go on." 

Tt/IR. Holland nodded. "We 
campaigned with Berendtsen 
together, sure. That doesn't sit 
too well with some people around 
here. But it's true, and there're 
lots of people who remember it, 
so there's nothing wrong with my 
saying it. 

"Jim was Matt Garvin's oldest 
son," Mr. Holland went on. "You 
can be proud of your grandfather, boy. He held half of New 
York's East Side together, after 
the war. You've been taught 
about that. How they were killing 
each other for the sake of their 
ammunition, and how the women 
either had to stick close to their 
men everywhere they went, or 
else learn to fight as well as the 
men. It was Matt Garvin who 
changed all that, from Twentythird Street down to the Battery, 
all along the east side of Broadway. By the time some of those 
women had yearling kids, they 
could walk around outside in the 
daytime. 

"One of those kids was Jim, 
I was another, and Ted Berendtsen was a third. When Ted 
started forming the Army of Unification, Jim and I went along 
with him." 

Something that was half-reflex 



IRONCLAD

twisted Cott's mouth at the mention of the A.U. 

"It had to be done the way it 
was, Cott," Mr. Holland said. 
"How else was Ted going to get 
a central government started 
among a bunch of forted-up 
farmers and lone-wolf nomads? 
Beat 'em individually at checkers? We needed a government — 
and fast, before we ran out of 
cartridges for the guns and went 
back to spears and arrows." 

"They didn't have to do it 
their way," Cott said bitterly. 

Mr. Holland sighed. "Devil 
they didn't. Besides, do you know 
exactly how it was done? Were 
you there?" 

"My mother and father were. 
My mother remembers very 
well," Cott answered. Strange, 
how his fingers could wrap 
around the mug so tightly, yet 
no warning of the strain on bone 
and muscle got through to his 
brain. 

"Yeah," Mr. Holland said dryly, "your mother was always good 
at remembering. Does she remember Jim's passing the land 
on to your father after Berendtsen gave it to him?" 

Cott nodded. "Yes, sir, she 
does. She also remembers my 
uncle leading the group that wiped out her family, so that Berendtsen would have the land to 
give." 

"I wasn't there, son, but the 



way I heard it, her folks were 
from Pennsylvania. What were 
they doing, holding down Jersey 
land?" He paused. 

"Look, boy, it wasn't anybody's land. Her folks could 
have kept it, if they'd had any 
sense. They should' ve realized 
that all Ted wanted was for them 
to agree to take orders from him 
for a while, until there could be 
an election. And none of that 
kept her from marrying Bob Garvin." 

COTT took a deep breath. "My 
father, sir, never fought with 
Berendtsen. He was the youngest 
of Matt Garvin's children, and 
he struck out for himself after 
his father died. He was a free 
man, with a sense of Integrity 
that did not permit him to take 
someone else's orders." 

"He was also pretty good with 
that carbine. Might have had 
something to do with it." 

"It might have, sir," Cott 
agreed, welcoming the feeling of 
pride that forced out some of 
his uncertainty, 

Holland nodded. "He was the 
one who started this household 
defense business around here, 
wasn't he? Figured if a carbine 
could keep him free, an armored 
bunker could fence off his land 
and protect his whole family. 
Which wasn't a bad idea," he 
added. "Berendtsen unified this 



90 




 



country, but he didn't exactly 
clean it up. That was more of a 
job than a man could do in one 
lifetime." 

Holland drained his mug, put 
it down and wiped his mouth. 
"But, boy, don't you think those 
days are the past? Don't you 
think it's time we came out of the 
hedgehog houses and out of this 
hedgehog Integrity business?" 

Mr. Holland put his palms on 
the table and caught Cott's eyes 
with his own. "Don't you think 
it's time we finished the unifying 
job and got us a community 
where a boy can walk up to his 
neighbor's house in broad daylight, knock on the door and say 
hello to a girl if he wants to?" 

Cott had been listening with 
tangled emotions. But Holland's 
last words stung him and, once 
again, the thought of what had 
happened the previous night was 
laid bare, and all of his self-disgust with it. 

"I'm sorry, sir," he said, "but 
I fear we have differing views on 
the subject. A man's home is his 
defense, and his Integrity and 
that of his family is what keeps 
that defense strong and inviolate. 
The code by which we live is 
one which has evolved for the 
fulfillment of the vital requisites 
for freedom. If we abandon it, 
we go back to the Dirty Years, 
And I'm afraid, sir—" he shuddered at remembrance of the out


rage he had felt the previous 
night — "that despite your best 
efforts, I will still marry your 
daughter honorably or not at 
all." 

Holland shook his head and 
smiled faintly. Cott realized how 
foolish that last sentence had 
sounded. Nevertheless, while he 
could not stem his impulses, he 
felt perfectly aware of the difference between right and wrong. 

Holland stood up. "All right, 
boy. You stick to your system. 
Only — it doesn't seem to work so 
well for you, docs it?" 

Once again, Mr. Holland turned around and walked away, 
leaving Cott with nothing to say 
or do, with no foundation of assurance. It was worse than any 
insult. 

TTIS footsteps were unsteady as 
he crossed the club floor. 
The rum, combined with his 
sleepless night, had settled into 
a weight at the base of his skull. 
He was about to open the door 
when Chuck Kittredge laid a 
hand on his arm. 

' 'How do you do, Garvin ?" 
Kittredge said. 

Cott smiled. Chuck was his 
neighbor on the side away from 
Mr. Holland. "How do you do?" 

"You look a little tired," 
Chuck remarked. 

"I am, Kittredge." 

"Shouldn't wonder — with you 



IRONCLAD 



91 



holding Drill right at dawn." 

Cott shrugged. "Have to keep 
the defenses in shape, you know." 

Kittredge laughed. "Why, for 
Pete's sake? Or were you just rehearsing for the Fourth?" 

Cott frowned. "Why — no, of 
course not. I've heard you holding Drill often enough." 

His neighbor nodded. "Sure — 
whenever one of the kids has a 
birthday. But you don't really 
mean you were holding a genuine, dead-serious affair?" 

Cott was having a little trouble 
concentrating. He squinted and 
shook his head slightly. "What's 
the matter with that?" 

Kittredge's voice and manner 
became more serious. "Oh, now 
look, Garvin, there's been nothing for us to defend against in 
fifteen years. Matter of fact, I'm 
thinking of dismounting my artillery entirely." 

Cott looked at him uncomprehendingly. "You can't be serious!" 

Kittredge returned the look. 
"Sure." 

"But you can'r. They'd be out 
of machinegun range, and they'd 
shell you to fragments with mortars and fieldpieces. They'd 
knock out your machinegun turrets, close in under their rifle 
cover and lob grenades into your 
living quarters." 

Kittredge laughed. He slapped 
his hand against his thigh while 



his shoulders shook. "Who the 
devil is 'they?' he gasped. "Berendtsen?" 

Cott felt the first touch of 
anger as it penetrated the deadening blanket that had wrapped 
itself around his thoughts. 

Kittredge was still chuckling. 
"Come off it, will you, Cott? As 
a matter of fact, while I wasn't 
going to mention it, all that 
banging at your place this morning practically ruined one of my 
cows. Ran head-on into a fence. 
It's not the first time it's happened, either. The only reason 
I've never said anything before 
is because your own livestock 
probably has just as bad a time 
of it. 

"Look, Cott, we're farmers. 
Farmers can't afford to unnerve 
their livestock and poison their 
land. It was fine while it was the 
only way we could operate at all, 
but the most hostile thing seen 
around here since Berendtsen's 
death was a chicken hawk." 

The anger turned into genuine 
rage. Cott could feel it settling 
into the pit of his stomach and 
vibrating at his fingertips. "So 
you're asking me to stop holding 
Drill, is that it?" 

ITTREDGE recognized the 
rasping note, and frowned. 
"Not a/together, Cott. Not if you 
don't want to. But I wish you'd 
save it for celebrations."

"The weapons of my household aren't firecrackers !" 

"Aw, come on, Cott!" 

For almost twenty-four hours, 
Cott had been encountering situations to which there were no 
solutions in his experience. He 
was baffled, frustrated, angry. 
The carbine was off his shoulder 
and in his hands with the speed 
and smoothness of motion that 
his father had drilled into him 
until it was beyond impediment 
by exhaustion or alcohol. 

"Charles Kittredge, I charge 
you with attempt to breach the 
Integrity of my household. Load 
and fire." 

The formula, too, was as ingrained in Cott as was his whole 
way of life. Chuck Kittredge 
knew it as well as he did. He 
blanched. 

"You gone crazy?" It was a 
new voice, from slightly beyond 
and beside Chuck. Cott's surprised glance flicked over and saw 
Chuck's younger brother, Michael. 

"Do you stand with him?" 
Cott's voice rapped out. 

"Aw, now look, Cott," Chuck 
Kittredge said, "you're not serious about this?" 

"Stand or turn your back." 

"Cott! All I said was — " 

"Am I to understand that you 
are attempting to explain yourself?" 

Michael Kittredge moved for


ward. "What's the matter with 
you, Garvin? You living in the 
Dirty Years or something?" 

The knot of fury in Cott's 
stomach twisted itself tighter. 
"That'll be far enough. I asked 
you — do you stand with him?" 

"No, he doesn't!" Chuck Kittredge said violently. "And I 
don't stand either. What kind of 
damned foolishness is this, anyway? People don't just pull challenges at the drop of a hat like 
that any more!" 

"That's for each man to decide 
for himself," Cott answered. "Do 
you turn your back?" 

A N ugly flush flamed in Chuck 
Kittredge's cheekbones. 
"Damned if I will." His mouth 
clamped into an etched white 
line. "All right, Cott, who goes 
through the door first, you or 
me?" 

"Nobody will go anywhere. 
You'll stand or turn where you 
are." 

"Right here, in the club? You 
are crazy!" 

"You chose the place, not I. 
Load and fire." 

Chuck Kittredge put his hand 
on his rifle sling. "On the count 
then," he said hopelessly. 

Cott reslung his carbine. 
"One," he said. 

"Two." He and Chuck picked 
up the count together. 

"Three," in unison, again. 



IRONCLAD 



93 



"Four." 
"Fi— " 

Cott had not bothered to count 
five aloud. The carbine fell into 
his hooked and waiting hands 
and jumped once. Kittredge, interrupted in the middle of his 
last word, collapsed to the club 
floor. 

Cott looked down at him and 
then back to Michael, who was 
looking at Cott incredulously. 

"Do you stand with him?" 
Cott repeated the formula once 
more. 

Michael shook his head dumbly. 

"Then turn!" 

Michael nodded. "I'll turn. 
Sure, I'll be a coward." There 
was a peculiar quality to his 
voice. Cott had seen men turn 
before, but never as though by 
free choice. Except for Holland, 
of course, the thought came. 

Cott looked at the width of 
Michael's back, and reslung his 
carbine. "All right, Michael. 
Take your dead home to your 
household." He stood where he 
was while Chuck's body was 
hoisted over his brother's shoulder. "He was a good friend of 
mine, Michael. I'm sorry he 
forced me to do it." 

As he walked home, past Mr. 
Holland's house, Cott did not 
turn his head to see if there were 
lights in any of the windows. He 
had kept his Integrity unbreach


ed. He had forced another man 
to turn. But he didn't dare tell 
himself he hoped Barbara would 
understand that, in a sense, he 
had done it for her. 

IV 

rriWO days later, at dinnertime, 
Geoffrey and Alister came in 
five minutes late. Geoffrey's face 
was wide and numb with shock, 
and Alister's was glowing with a 
rampant inner joy. It was only 
when Geoffrey turned that Cott 
saw his left sleeve was soaked 
in blood. 

"Geoffrey!" Cott's mother 
pushed her chair back and ran 
to him. She pulled a med kit off 
its wall bracket and began cutting the sleeve away. 

"What happened?" Cott asked. 

"I got my man today," Geoffrey said, his voice as numb as 
his features. "He rightfully belongs to Alis, though." A grin 
broke through the numbness, 
and a babble of words came out 
as the shock of the wound passed 
from numbness to hysteria. 

"That crazy Michael Kittredge 
climbed up a tree at the edge of 
the practice terrain. Had a 
'scope -mounted T-4 and six extra clips. Must have figured on 
an all-out war. First thing I 
knew, it felt like somebody hit 
my shoulder with a bat and I was 
down. Slugs plowed the ground 



94 




 



in circles around me. I tried to 
do something with my rifle, but 
no go. Kittredge must have had 
cross-eyes or something — couldn't 
hit the side of a cliff with a 
howitzer, after that first shot. 
Damn fool stunt, 'scope-mounting an automatic — somebody 
should have taught him better — 
and there I was, passing out from 
the recoil every time / squeezed. 
You never saw such a blind 
man's shooting match in your 
life, Cott! 

"Then, out of this gully that 
he'd been imitating an elephant 
wallowing through, up pops Alis! 
Slaps the old M-l to his scrawny 
little shoulder, stands up like the 
man atop a skeet-shoot trophy 
and starts blasting away at Kittredge's tree as if nothing was up 
there but pigeons! Tell you, the 
sight of that came nearer killing 
me than Kittredge's best out of 
thirty. 

"Well, Kittredge might have 
been crazy, but he wasn't up to 
ignoring eight 30s. He swings 
that lunatic T-4 of his for Alis, 
here, and this gives me a chance 
to steady up and put a lucky 
shot through a leaf he happened 
to be in back of at the time. He's 
still out there." 

Cott felt his teeth go into his 
lower lip. Michael Kittredge! 

"He shot you from ambush?" 

"He wasn't carrying any banners!" 



"But that's disgraceful!" Cott's 
mother exclaimed. She finished 
wrapping gauze over the patch 
bandage on Geoffrey's bicep. 

|~»OTT looked at Alister, who 
^ was standing beside Geoffrey, his face still shining. "Was 
that what happened, Alister?" he 
asked. 

Alister nodded. 

"Sure, that's what happened!" 
Geoff re y said indignantly. 
"Think this is a mosquito btte?" 

"You know what this means, 
don't you?" Cott asked gravely. 

Geoffrey began a shrug and 
winced. "Fool kid with a bug." 

Cott shook his head. "The Kittredges may be lax in their training, but Michael knew better. In 
a sense, that was a declaration of 
war. f Michael was out there, 
the rest of his household may not 
have known about it, but they'll 
be forced to support his action 
when they find out." 

"So it's a declaration of war." 
Alister finally found his voice, 
his tones a conscious imitation 
of Geoffrey's. "What have we 
been drilling for?" 

Geoffrey's eyes opened wide, 
and the secretive laughter returned to his expression as he 
looked at his younger brother. 

"Not to start a war — or get 
involved in one," Cott said. 
"Their gunnery will be sloppier 
than ours, but I know that their 



IRONCLAD 



95 



armor plate's just as thick." 

"What do you want to do, Cottrell?" his mother asked. Her 
delicate face was anxious, and 
her hands seemed to be poised for 
the express purpose of underscoring the question. 

"We've got to stop this thing 
before it snowballs," Geoffrey 
said. "I didn't get it before, but 
Cott's right." 

Cott nodded. "We'll have to 
call everybody to a meeting. I 
don't know what can be done 
about the Kittredges. Maybe we'll 
all be able to think of something." He beat the side of his 
fist lightly against his thigh. "I 
don't know. It's never been done 
before. But these aren't Berendtsen's Militia. We can't handle 
the problem by simply dropping 
our shutters and fighting it out 
as independent units. The whole 
community would wind up firing 
on each other. We've got to have 
concerted action. Perhaps, if the 
comunity lines up in a solid block 
against the Kittredges, we'll be 
able to block them." 

"Unite the community I" His 
mother's eyes were wide. "Do you 
think you can do it?" 

Cott sighed. "I don't know, 
Mother. I couldn't guess." He 
turned to Alister. "We're going 
up to the club. It's the only 
natural meeting place we've got. 
I think you'd better break out 
the car. The Kittredges might 



have more snipers out." 

He picked his carbine from the 
arms-rack and moved to follow Alister down to the garage. 

"I'll go with you," Geoffrey 
said. "Only takes one arm to 
work the turret guns." 

Cott looked at him indecisively. Finally, he said, "All right. 
There's no telling what the Kittredges might be up to along 
the road." He turned back toward his mother. "I think it 
might be advisable to put the 
household on action stations." 
She nodded, and he went down 
into the garage. 

rriHE road was open and glaring white in the sunlight of 
early afternoon. The armored 
car's tires jounced over the latitudinal ruts that freight wagons 
had worn into the surface. One 
part of his mind was worried 
about the effect on Geoffrey, battened down in the turret. He 
looked up through the overhead 
slits and saw the twin muzzles 
of the 35mm cannon tracking 
steadily counterclockwise. 

When did it begin? he thought. 
The chain of recent events was 
clear. From the moment Mr. 
Holland had discovered him, 
four nights ago, event had followed event as plainly and inevitably as though each had been 
planned. 

If he had not been upset by 



96 




 



his meeting with Mr. Holland, 
he would not have called Drill 
the following morning. If he had 
never seen Barbara at her window at all, there would have 
been nothing for Geoffrey to taunt 
him with and no fear of exposure 
to drive him to the club. If he 
had not been drinking, Mr. Holland's references to Uncle James 
would not have cut so deep. Had 
there been no Drill, there would 
have been no quarrel with Chuck 
Kittredge. And even if there had 
been Drill, Chuck's remarks 
would not have seemed so objectionable had there been no 
smoldering resentment from his 
talk with Mr. Holland. 

For he had been angry. Had 
he not been. Chuck and Michael 
would not be dead, and the Garvins would not now be in the 
car, trying to stop an upheaval 
of violence that would involve 
the entire community. But his 
anger had not been only his responsibility. A breach of Integrity remained a breach of 
Integrity, no matter what the 
subjective state of the Party at 
Grievance. 

But where had it really begun? 
If his mother had introduced him 
to Barbara, would any of this 
have happened? 

He rejected that possibility. 
His mother had been acting in 
accordance with the code that 
his father and the other free 



men who had settled in this area 
had evolved. And the code was 
a good code. It had kept the 
farmlands free and in peace, with 
no man wearing another's collar 
—until Michael "Kittredge broke 
the code. 

And, so thinking, he turned the 
car off the road and stopped in 
front of the club. 

^T^HE porch was already cTOwd■■■ ed with men. As he climbed 
out of the car's hatch, he saw 
that all the families of the community, with the exception of 
the Kittredges, were represented. 
Olsen, Hollis, Winter, Jones, Cadell, Rome, Lynn, Williams, 
Bridges, Van Dall — all of them. 
Even Mr. Holland stood near the 
center of the porch, his lined 
face graver than Cott had ever 
seen it. 

He walked toward them. The 
news had spread rapidly. He remembered that a lot of the 
households had radios now. He 
had never seen any use for them 
before. 

We ought to get one, now, 
though. As long as we're uniting, 
a fast communications channel 
is a good idea. 

"That's far enough, Garvin!" 
He stopped and stared up at the 
men on the porch. Hollis had 
lifted his rifle. 

Cott frowned. One or two other 
guns in the crowd were being 



IRONCLAD 



97 



raised in his direction. 

"I don't understand," he said. 

Hollis snorted. He looked past 
Cott at the car. "Anybody in that 
buggy tries something, we've got 
a present for him." 

The men on the porch drew off 
to either side. Two men were 
crouched in the club's doorway. 
One held a steady antitank rocket launcher on his shoulder and 
the other, having fed the rocket 
into the chamber, stood ready 
to slap the top of his head for 
the signal to fire. 

"I'm afraid I don't — " 

"Looks like you've united the 
community, boy," Mr. Holland 
said. "Against you." 

Cott felt the familiar surge of 
anger ripple through his body. 
"Against me! What for?" 

There was a scattered chorus 
of harsh laughs. 

"What about Chuck Kittredge?" Hollis asked. 

"Chuck Kittredge! That was 
an affair of Integrity," Cott exploded. 

"Yeah? Whose — yours or his?" 
Hollis said. 

"Seems like the day of Integrity has come and gone, son," 
Mr. Holland said gently. 

"Yeah, and what about Michael Kittredge?" somebody shouted from the back of the crowd. 
"Was that an affair of Integrity 
too?" 

"What about those two broth


ers of yours shooting him out of 
that tree?" someone else demanded. 

"Geoffrey's in the car with a 
wounded arm right now!" Cott 
yelled. 

"And Michael Kittredge is 
dead I" 

There was a babble of voices. 
The burst of sound struck Cott's 
ears. "All right!" he shouted. "All 
right! I came up here to ask you 
to stop the Kittredges with me. I 
see they got to you first. All 
right! Then we'll take them on 
alone, and the devil can have all 
of you!" 

COMEHOW, in the storm of an*^ swers that came from the 
porch, Mr. Holland's quiet voice 
came through. 

"No good, boy. When I said 
'against you,* I meant it. It's not 
a case of them not helping you — 
it means they're going to start 
shelling your place in two hours, 
whether you're in it or not." 

"No!" The word was torn out 
of him, and even he had to analyze its expression. It was not a 
command nor a request nor a 
statement of fact or wonder. It 
was simply a word and he knew 
better than anyone else who 
heard it how ineffectual it was. 

"So you'd better get your family out of there, son." The other 
men on the porch had fallen 
silent, all of them watching ex


98 




 



cept for the two men with the 
rocket launcher, who ignored 
everything but the armored car. 

Mr. Holland came off the porch 
and walked toward him. He put 
his hand on his shoulder. "Let's 
be getting back, son. Lots of room 
at my place for your family." 

Cott looked up at the men on 
the porch again. They were completely silent, all staring back at 
him as though he were some 
strange form of man they had 
never seen before. 

He muttered, "All right." 

Mr. Holland climbed through 
the hatch, and Cott followed him, 
slamming it shut and settling into 



the driver's seat. He gunned the 
idling engine, locked his left rear 
wheel, spun the car around. With 
the motor at full gun and the 
dust billowing behind it, the 
armored car roared back down 
the road. 

"I heard most of it, Cott." 
Geoffrey's tight and bitter voice 
came over the intercom. "Let's 
get back to the house in a hurry. 
We can dump a ton of frag on 
that porch before those birds find 
out what's hitting them." 

Cott shook his head before 
he remembered that Geoffrey 
couldn't see him. "They'll be 
gone, Jeff. Scattered to their 




IRONCLAD 



99 




houses, getting ready." 

"Well, let's hit their houses, 
then," Alister said from behind 
the machine gun at the car's 
turtledeck. 

"Wouldn't stand a chance, 
son," Mr. Holland said. 

"He's right.. They've got us 
cold," Cott agreed. 

What had happened to the 
code? His father had lived by 
it — all the people in the community had lived by it. He himself had lived by it — he caught 
himself. Had tried to live by it, 
and failed. 

V 

COTT stood in the yard in 
front of Mr. Holland's house. 
It had taken an hour and a half 
of the time Hollis had given him 
to get back to his house and move 



his family and a few belongings 
into Mr. Holland's house. He had 
kissed his mother and raised his 
hand as she turned back at the 
doorway. "I'll be all right, Mother," he said. "There are a few 
things that I'd like to attend to." 

"All right, son. Don't be long." 

He nodded, though she was already inside the house. 

Geoffrey and Alister were deep 
inside Mr. Holland's house, taking care of their grandmother and 
the younger children. Cott smiled 
crookedly. Alister would be all 
right. He hoped Geoffrey wasn't 
too old to adapt. 

Mr. 1 Holland came out. "Coming in. son?" He chuckled. "I'll 
introduce you to my daughter." 

Barbara. He looked at the Sun. 
No, not enough time. Well, 
there'd be plenty afterward. 

"I'll be back, Mr. Holland. Got 
a few loose ends to tie up." 

Holland looked over the low, 
barely visible roof of Cott's 
house. 

A small dustcloud was approaching it from the other side. 
He nodded. "Yeah, I see what 
you mean. Well, hurry up. You 
haven't got more than about 
twenty minutes." 

Cott nodded. "I'll see you." He 
dropped the carbine into his hand 
and loped out of the yard, not 
having to worry about the dog

100 




 



the crest of a rise that overlooked 
his house. He flattened himself in 
the high grass and inched forward, until his head and shoulders were over the crest, but still 
hidden in the grass. 

He had been right. There were 
three men just climbing out of a 
light guncarrier. 

Looters, he thought. Welt, 
that's what our grandparents 
were. He slipped the safety. And 
our parents had a code. And now, 
his brothers had a united community. But I've lived in the past 
all my life, and I guess I've got 
Integrity. 

He fired, and one of the men 
slapped at his stomach and fell. 

HHHE other two dived apart, 
their own rifles in their hands. 
Cott laughed and threw dirt into 
their faces with a pair of shots. 
One of them bucked his shoulders up involuntarily as the dirt 
flew into his eyes. Cott fired 
again, and the shoulders slumped. Thanks for a trick, Geoffrey. 

The other man fired back — 
using half a clip to cut the grass 
a foot to Cott's right. He dropped back below the crest, rolled 
and came up again, ten feet from 
where he had been. 

Down by the house, the remaining man moved. Cott put a 
bullet an inch above his head. 

He had about ten minutes. 
Well, if he kept that man pinned 



down, the first salvo would do 
as thorough a job as any carbine 
shot. 

The man moved again — a little 
desperately this time — and Cott 
tugged at his pants leg with a 
snap shot. 

Five minutes, and the man 
moved again. He was shouting 
something. Cott turned his ear 
toward him to cut the hum from 
the breeze, but couldn't make out 
the words. He pinned the man 
down again. 

When he had a minute of life 
left, the man tried to run for it. 
He sprang up suddenly, running 
away from the guncarrier, and 
Cott missed him for that reason. 
When the man cut back, he shot 
him through the leg. 

Damn! Jeff could have done 
better than that! 

The man was crawling for the 
carrier. 

Over at the Kittredge's, the 
first muzzle-flashes flared, and 
the thud of the guns rolled over 
the hills. 

Cott put a bullet through the 
crawling man's head. 

He had been right about the 
Kittredges' poor gunnery, as he 
had been about the looters. The 
first salvo landed a hundred 
yards over — on the very crest of 
the ridge where Cott was standing, his carbine in his hand. Poor 
shooting, but just as fatal.
