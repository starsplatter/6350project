The MERCHANTS Of Venus By A. H. PHELPS, Jr. 

THE telephone rang. Reluctantly, Rod Workham 
picked it up. Nothing good 
had come from that phone in six 
years, and his sour expression 
was almost an automatic reflex. 
"Workham here," he said. 
He held the phone an inch 
away from his ear, but the tirade 
exceeded his expectations — it 
would have been audible a foot 
away: 

"Workham! How long do you 
think we're going to stand for 
this! At the rate you're going, 
there won't be a man left on 



Venus or a dollar in the budget! 
What kind of a personnel director 
are you? Don't you know this 
project is vital to every person 
on Earth? Thirty more resignations came in on this last mail 
flight." 

Rod put the receiver gently on 
his desk. General Carlson raved 
and ranted this way every time 
a colonist quit, and Rod knew he 
was not expected to answer, even 
if given the chance. The general 
would carry on for about five 
minutes and then would slam 
down the phone himself.

He dialed another number on 
the other phone. 

"This is Rod, Dave," he said 
when he got an answer. "Carlson 
is on the other phone, yelling at 
my desk blotter. He says thirty 
more resignations came in just 
now. That right?" 

"Close enough, Rod — twentythree pulled out. That makes 
seventy-eight per cent resigned 
in less than — " 

"Spare me the statistics — Carlson's probably blatting them right 
now. How do they break down? 
Are they mostly farmers or technicians?" 

"There were only nine technicians left, and all of them quit 
with this bunch. The rest were 
farmers." Dave Newson must be 
smoking his pipe, Rod decided — 
grinding sounds were coming over 
the phone. "That doesn't leave 
very much on Venus to start a 
colony with — a few farmers, some 
trappers. And the scientific personnel — damn it, they seem to 
stick it out all right — " 

"Their contracts are different," 
Rod reminded him. "They go on 
a two year hitch and then come 
back to Earth if they want to. 
The ones who are there are the 
ones who can take it and are 
signed up again." 

*T*HERE was a speculative 
pause on the other end of the 
line. "Say, Rod," Newson said 



slowly. "Why not leave this last 
batch of quitters right where they 
are? Every one of them. They 
signed up for the project with 
their eyes open. Why don't you 
just refuse to bring them home? 
. . . they'd have to make a go 
of the colony to save their filthy 
necks!" 

Rod grinned nastily. "I'd like 
to do it — but even General Carlson wouldn't dare. We'd never 
get another colonist off Earth, 
once it got out. They wouldn't 
trust us. Our first problem is to 
get a self- supporting society on 
Venus — and that might do it, all 
right. But our main job is to relieve the crowding on Earth, and 
that means large numbers of people will have to go willingly later 
on. If we get tough with these 
babies, who will take a chance 
later on that we won't repeat 
the trick?" 

"But we lose a hundred potential colonists every time one of 
these quitters starts talking about 
why he left! More harm is done 
by letting them come back than 
would result from leaving them 
where they are." Again the speculative pause. "Maybe you could 
shoot them on arrival?" 

"I'll suggest it to the general 
when I see him," Rod said, "if 
he doesn't shoot me first. Now, 
can you get me the files on this 
latest group? And I'd like to see 
the staff psychologist here, along 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



103 



with all the interviewers who 
handled and passed the group. 
We'll see what we can salvage 
out of this. And if you see 
Jaimie, send him along too, will 
you? Maybe our gambling historian can find us something useful in the Project Record." 

"The files are already on the 
way. And I told Biddington you'd 
probably want to see him — he 
said he'd be along in about ten 
minutes. I haven't located all the 
interviewers yet. Jaimie's been 
right here, trying to talk me into 
a game of Nim and protesting 
he never heard of binary numbers. I'll send him up, but keep 
your hand on your wallet. If you 
need anything else, I'll be right 
here." 

DOD thanked him and hung 
up, shaking his head. Dave 
Newsom was too good a man to 
be stuck on a government project 
— he ought to get out before the 
trouble started. Anyone who 
worked for Rod Workham on 
Project Venus was likely to end 
up with a bad name. They lived 
under the ax. The only person 
who could be sure of his job was 
Rod himself. He'd been recommended by a committee of top 
men in his field, and no other 
personnel man would accept the 
job if he were removed. Also, 
most of his men would leave 
the project if General Carlson 



bounced him, for they had been 
telling him so ever since the job 
had gotten hot. 

But there was the danger that 
the general might decide to bypass Personnel in selecting colonists — or, what was more probable, might try to tame the planet 
with a military outpost. 

Rod could hardly blame the 
man for his feelings. The job wa. 
vital, and everyone was intensely 
interested in making a go of it. 
Scientific agriculture had gone 
about as far as it could; hydroponics had already begun to 
shoulder the load required by an 
overpopulated planet. But the 
fact known to most intelligent 
people on Earth was that either 
new room was found in this kind 
of emergency, some place where 
people could go and live under 
nearly the same standards, or 
else some drastic changes in living standards would be required 
of all. And absolute and rigidly 
enforced birth control would have 
to go into effect. And all the 
attendant causes for race wars, 
nationalist wars, and have-not 
wars would crop up. 

But the majority of the people 
wouldn't move to an undeveloped 
planet. You couldn't send ordinary citizens as pioneers. For 
one thing, they wouldn't want to 
go. For another, the new community wouldn't last long if you 
forced them to go — the average 




 



person had neither the attitudes 
nor the physique needed to make 
over a wilderness. 

The problem was to find people 
who would create a community 
on a new planet and develop an 
integrated society there. This had 
meant rigid selection, careful 
psychological preparation and a 
terrifically expensive transportation system to get the people 
there and keep them supplied. 
And the job had to be done soon. 
Economists predicted that thirty 
years were left on Earth under 
present standards, maybe fifty. 
If the population couldn't be 
thinned out one way by then, 
it would have to be done by another. 

T70R six years, now. Rod had 
worked on the job of establishing a self-supporting colony 
on Venus. Three different colonies had been started, and each 
had died out in less than two 
years. Resignations would come 
in slowly at first, and then in a 
rush, until only twenty or thirty 
people would be left, of which the 
majority would be short-term 
scientific teams. By the terms of 
the colonists' contracts no man 
could be left on Venus more than 
a month after his resignation; so 
the bulk of two colonies had 
simply had to be shipped back 
to Earth, and plans made for 
another try. 



And now the third colony was 
quitting, rushing home, leaving 
nothing on the jungle planet but 
a few small clearings soon to be 
taken over by the vegetation. 

Several times in the last year 
Rod had thought of volunteering himself; but he knew it for a 
futile gesture. He wasn't five hundred men. He didn't even have 
the special skills or physique that 
were needed. 

His gloomy thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of the 
men. 

Biddington was first. Then in 
twos and threes came the interviewers, all looking like the home 
team at the half, three touchdowns behind and just waiting 
for their coach. 

If psychologists made good 
colonists. Rod thought, here 
would be a dozen more volunteers. 

The arrival of Homer Jaimison 
brought the only cheerful face 
in the group. The project historian was a young man, just 
over thirty, and considerably over 
six feet. He wore the expression 
of a man who is itching to do 
something. Jaimie had never 
really been busy yet on the 
project — the colonies had died out 
so quickly that his work had 
been mostly clerical, and he'd 
had to fill in time as best he 
could. So far he had done it 
making up improbable contests 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



105 



of skill for drinks, with such a 
weird assortment of shifting rules 
and scoring that he hadn't paid 
for a drink since his arrival. 
He made a valuable contribution 
to the project, however, since 
he helped to keep the group's 
minds off their troubles a part 
of the time. 

Rod genuinely liked Jaimie, 
and expected to miss him strongly when Venus became self-supporting to the point where the 
historian would have to complete 
his work in residence. 

TTTHEN they were all seated, 
" Rod leaned against his desk 
and said, "I can see you all 
know why we're here. To begin 
with, I'm not going to accuse 
anyone of mistakes. Each of you 
is the best possible man in the 
country* for his job. If you 
weren't, you wouldn't be here. I 
wouldn't have asked for you ; 
and General Carlson wouldn't 
have kept you. So there's nothing 
to feel bad about. If you can't 
do this work, no one can. Selfrecrimination is foolish when 
you've been put on an impossible problem. I didn't call you 
in to bawl you out, but to ask 
you if we should continue spending project funds for nothing." 

Jaimie raised his eyebrows at 
this speech, but said nothing. 

"What do you mean, impossible problem?" one of the inter


viewers objected. "We know what 
we need — it's just that we're still 
making some mistake in selection 
that we haven't corrected." 

"That's right, Rod." Biddington, the project psychologist, took 
up the dissension. "We know 
something is wrong with the selection techniques, or in the personality patterns we consider 
necessary. But it's only a problem of finding out what it is. The 
problem is by no means insoluble." 

"As long as you're not ready 
to give us up," another interviewer said, "we aren't going to 
quit." 

"You can't afford to get defeatist about this. Rod," Biddington 
went on. "This project is too 
important to fail. Whether you 
like it or not, your experience is 
too valuable for you to back out." 

Rod grinned and held up his 
hands. "All right. That's the reaction I wanted. If you all still 
think we can get somewhere, we 
may as well try to analyze this 
last group." He sat down at his 
desk. "I have the files here, along 
with the tapes of the interviews. 
Let's see what difference we can 
find between those who hung on 
this long, and the ones that quit 
after the first three months." 

HPHE group settled down to try■■■ ing to differentiate between 
a man who couldn't do a job 



106 




 



but could try for six months 
longer than the next. They took 
the colonists carefully apart, trait 
by trait, and put them all back. 
They reviewed the colonists' records from birth, and compared 
them in endless combinations. 
Jaimie came into the discussion 
to show what the status of the 
colonies had been at the time 
each colonist had resigned : what 
diseases had been encountered 
when one man quit; how much 
jungle had been cleared before 
another did. 

Files came and went in a continuous flux; coffee and sandwiches came and grew cold and 
stale. The air became gray with 
smoke. 

Nothing. 

The same results had come out 
of every investigation: You needed a man who was unstable to 
get him to leave Earth. You needed a man who was stable to have 
him stay on Venus. You needed 
initiative and resourcefulness to 
survive on a new planet. You 
needed a man who had so little 
initiative and resourcefulness that 
the competition on Earth wouldn't 
be profitable. You needed a 
young, healthy, vigorous specimen. You needed an older, experienced, more mature person. 

You needed A and you needed 
non-A. 

And even if you found people 
with the factors balanced just 



right, assuming you knew what 
the balance should be, where did 
you find five hundred of them? 

The discussion went on. The 
solutions got wilder and more 
absurd. Take whole orphan asylums and bring them up on Venus 
under military guard. Build a 
development in the steamiest, 
nastiest jungle, and test recruits 
for the colony there. Send African 
natives. 

The men were beginning to 
make the whole thing look impossible again, so Rod decided to 
call a halt until they could get a 
better perspective. Tired himself, 
he dismissed them. They left 
quietly, not arguing in little 
groups or mumbling half-formed 
ideas to themselves, the way a 
team that has been progressing 
will do. 

i~kNLY Jaimie stayed. He re^-^ mained sitting hunched up 
near the desk, in the same position he'd held for the last hour. 
When the others had all left, 
he grinned at Rod. 

"You know, for a group of 
practicing psychologists, this is 
the softest bunch of suckers I've 
seen." 

"You've proved that to your 
own profit several times so far," 
Rod answered, rubbing his face 
as though smoothing the wrinkles 
could remove the tension. "Who 
have you robbed lately?" 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



107 



"I'm talking about your performance just now. Here comes 
the whole crew, walking in with 
their heads hanging to the floor. 
Every last man was ready to tell 
you he was quitting — that the 
problem was insoluble. And before anyone can say a word, 
you tell them that the whole 
thing is impossible and imply 
that you want to quit. Even Biddington fell for it. You can't back 
out now, Rod, they say. Let's 
not have defeatist talk out of 
you, of all people — " 

"I did feel that way," Rod 
said. "I'm just about ready to 
quit. I think that whatever our 
mistake has been, we can't do 
any better than we have. We 
just don't know enough." 

Jaimie wasn't grinning now. 
"What will happen if you quit?" 

"My guess is that Carlson will 
set up a military outpost there. 
Make a clearing, build a fort, 
maybe a town. Then he'll try 
to get people to come and live 
in it." Rod sighed. "It won't 
work. They'll want to know why 
the planet had to be colonized 
that way — why wouldn't the first 
colonists stay?" 

"I agree. The military outpost 
is a fine method for spreading 
a culture to an existing civilization. Rome did much for Europe 
that way; the most powerful cities 
sprang up near the Roman forts 
and roads. But as a method for 



inducing the populace to a new 
place, it doesn't work. A free 
people will not willingly move 
into a military township." Jaimie 
looked sharply at Rod. "So what 
do you intend to do — run out 
and turn it all over to Carlson?" 

"I don't know, Jaimie. I just 
don't know. Six years is a long 
time." 

"Damn it. Rod, you had much 
worse jobs than this one in industry! How did you select a 
computer man, a communications man, an engineering physicist, out of a group of men with 
similar backgrounds? It seems to 
me a harder problem than this." 

"We don't really know much, 
as I said," Rod said. "Ours has 
often been an imitation science. 
When we had to select a computer man, we just gave a battery of tests to successful computer men — structural vision, 
vocabulary, tri-dimensional memory, ink-blots, syllogisms, practically everything. Then we 
weeded out the tests whose scores 
appeared to have no statistical 
relevance. Any future computer 
man had to duplicate those results, whatever they were. If we 
had a recently pioneered civilization around, Jaimie, you'd find 
this whole staff running through 
it like pollsters before an election." 

"What was all this talk about 
balance, instability, initiative and 



108 




 



all the rest?" asked Jamie. 

"That's what we do when we 
don't know, Jaimie. We try to 
predict what we need; then we 
try to find ways of finding it in 
people." 

JAIMIE made an explosive 
sound. "But I thought you 
must have progressed from empirical methods ! I would have 
said something long ago, if I 
hadn't thought you knew what 
you were doing all the time !" 
The historian was on his feet, 
stalking about the room. "Why 
didn't you tell me about this before?" 

"Why? What difference would 
it have made?" Rod frowned, 
failing to understand the other's 
excitement. "Sure, we've progressed from the older methods, in 
that we now have pretty complete data for all present job descriptions. And we can synthesize 
data for a new job, if it's not too 
different. But there isn't any information on the kind of person 
needed in a new world. What the 
devil are you getting so upset 
about?" 

The historian threw himself 
into a chair and glared at Rod. 
"If you couldn't find the kind 
of people you needed to test, you 
could have asked a historian if 
he knew anything about them!" 

Rod shook his head puzzledly. 
"Subjective data, such as that — " 



"Don't bring subjectivity into 
this, damn it! We get enough of 
that from physical scientists." 
Jaimie held himself in the chair, 
almost shaking with the intensity 
of his feeling. "Look, Rod, you 
know I want to see the project 
succeed. And you admit that you 
haven't got an answer. Well, 
baby, I think I have ! It's an 
idea that has about a fifty-fifty 
chance of being right in this case 
. . . would you be willing to try 
it?" 

"If I had been betting on your 
side for the last few months, I'd 
be several dollars richer," Rod 
smiled. "Yes, I think I might go 
along with your idea, if you can 
convince me it has an even chance 
for success. Three failures out of 
three tries makes for poorer odds 
than that. What do you have in 
mind?" 

"H'm," Jaimie said. "I imagine 
your stock isn't so high with old 
scabbard and blade right now, 
is it?" 

Rod laughed. "I don't think 
he'll shoot on sight, but I'm 
not positive enough to stand in 
front of a lighted window." 

"Well, then — if I had an idea 
you agreed with, the surest way 
to kill it would be to have you 
present it to him, right? And if 
you fight it, that's sure to convince Carlson!" Jaimie thought 
hard for a moment, tapping the 
chair-arm. "Rod, I have to do 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



109 




no 




 



something you aren't going to 
like. Do you trust me?" 

"You mean you're going to try 
this without even discussing it 
with the personnel group?" 

"That's right. If I don't tell 
you what I'm doing, I know 
you'll fight it. And I'll need that 
kind of help from you to push 
Carlson into doing it. 

"But I have to do something 
far worse than that, Rod. I'm 
going to tell the general that you 
knew my plan from the start, and 
have been sitting on it because 
I'm not a psychologist. I'm going 
to ruin your reputation with the 
worst set of lies since the Red 
purges. I'll say you're fighting 
me, because you can't accept an 
idea that came from a man outside of your own group. If the 
scheme doesn't work you'll be 
ruined, because there'll be no way 
to retract the lies. If it does 
work, we can announce that we 
put on an act to sell the plan to 
Carlson. Can you take it?" 

Rod was thoughtful for a few 
minutes. He liked and trusted 
Jaimie, but the man had no experience in this field — and this 
sounded like an all-or-nothing 
shot. 

Then he remembered his despair over the latest set of resignations. He'd been ready to quit 
— he had nothing to offer, and 
neither did his men. Even a wild 
idea was worth a try, he thought 



grimly — he would be risking 
nothing but a plan that had already failed. 

"Go to it, boy," he said. "And 
if you need a fight, you'll get a 
damn good one." 

HpHE fight with Carlson was 
short, and Rod was abruptly 
overruled. After that Jaimie 
moved fast. The new colonists 
flocked in. Three months after 
Rod's talk with him, the compounds started to fill. A shipload 
was a hundred men, and each 
new man had to wait in a group 
until it was filled. But there was 
no waiting now except for processing; the compounds were full 
before the ships were ready. 

Rod had paid no attention 
to Jaimie's recruiting methods, 
thinking that the historian's idea 
differed mainly in control over 
the colonists. 

Until he saw the crowds. 

Even from a distance, they/ 
didn't have the young look of 
the previous groups. Up close, 
they looked like the sweepings of 
the slums. 

He and Biddington talked to a 
few before they fully realized 
what Jaimie had done. All the 
men were sure that Venus was a 
mineral paradise — gold in the 
streams, uranium lodes so pure 
you had to wear a shield to get 
near them, diamonds, silver — 
every treasure that had ever ex


THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



111 



cited men on Earth was scattered around the new world waiting to be picked up. That was 
what Jaimie had told them. 

Rod got to a phone, fast. 

"Jaimie, you fool! I know what 
you're doing, and I won't put up 
with it! You've told these dupes 
they can get rich on Venus! You 
intended to attract large numbers of recruits, in the hope that 
some of them will be what we 
need — but look at what you attracted! Crooks, gangsters, bums, 
hoboes, sharecroppers and I don't 
know what. You got recruits all 
right . . . but what the hell kind 
of a society are you going to start 
with them! And who will go and 
live there among them later?" 

"What's the matter. Workham?" Jaimie asked coldly. "Are 
you a racial purist? Want only 
your kind of people to get to 
Venus?" 

"I don't care who goes, as long 
as they fit some standards. But 
to make a decent place, you need 
decent people — morally clean and 
healthy. Not this collection of 
mental cripples, alcoholics and 
thieves. Probably half of them 
are wanted men!" 

He argued further, unable to 
believe that this was Jaimison's 
great fifty-fifty chance. He said 
many things . . . and regretted 
every one ; for that night the 
telecasts carried a recorded version of his outburst. Jaimie had 



maneuvered him into saying 
things he didn't quite mean, so 
that it looked as if he was trying 
to hide the all good things on 
Venus and save them for his own 
friends. One commentator said 
outright that if you weren't a 
college graduate recommended by 
one of Workham's friends, it 
would cost you a thousand dollars to get on an outgoing ship. 
By the next morning, half the 
papers in the world were after 
Workham's scalp. 

ROD could only take the abuse 
and grind his teeth. How did 
you fight a thing like that? You 
were condemned if you kept 
silent, and if you answered, people nodded their heads and said, 
"See — he's still trying to deny it." 

The failures from the old colonies were Rod's only allies. They 
tried to tell people what Venus 
was like, and what lies Carlson 
and his stooge Jaimison were 
using for bait. But it was pointed 
out that these men naturally had 
a stake in the secret . . . and, after 
all, everyone knew how well off 
the returning colonists were ! This 
was actually due to the high 
premium paid to get men to go 
to the planet, but no one believed. 

Days passed. Weeks. The compounds filled, and emptied, and 
filled again. People stood in lines 
to apply. They walked miles to 




 



appear at a recruiting center. 
They fought for a place on the 
next ship, or the one after that. 
Farmers, clerks, ragged families, 
hoboes, armed men, teen-age 
boys and old men. Four thousand 
people applied in the first few 
months and were shipped out. 
Then the crowds thinned,, even 
though the Get Rich propaganda 
continued. Soon, only a few hundred appeared where there had 
been thousands; then twos and 
threes; at last only a dozen or 
so a day, many of whom changed 
their minds before the full shipload had been assembled. 

Rod clung to his job throughout. He had little to do, though 
his department had never been 
formally discontinued. Sooner or 
later, he knew, their services 
would be needed — when this 
cheap trick had failed. So he 
and his staff remained. Studying 
old files, making up test batteries, 
discussing survival factors, they 
readied themselves for the project 
again. From time to time they 
interviewed and tested a few of 
those waiting in the compounds. 
There was too much time to just 
sit around — even this activity was 
a welcome diversion. 

As the year passed, the number 
of prospective colonists stopped 
decreasing and held steady at 
about five a day. But slowly 
something else changed. Among 
the new arrivals there began to 



appear engineers who had tossed 
up good jobs to emigrate, farmers with their families, schoolteachers, storekeepers, lawyers, 
even doctors. All of them young. 
Not in any great number; but 
their appearance was a surprise 
still. Then there came two former 
colonists who had resigned on 
one of the earlier attempts, now 
trying to get back to Venus without inducement of bonus, high 
pay or guaranteed return. 

That was the day Rod decided 
to call on Jaimie. 

"T HAVE here a bottle of eightyear-old rye, Jaimie," he 
began. "I think you're entitled 
to a drink, and I'm entitled to an 
explanation. Want to swap?" 

"Rod!" Jaimie's bony face lit 
up. "It's good to see you. I've 
been afraid to call you until we 
could admit to the hoax. Come 
in, come in." 

"Well, you did it," Rod said, 
after they had settled down. "I 
met two former colonists in the 
compound today. They know 
there isn't gold on Venus, and 
still they want to go out for free. 
No contract. And lately we've 
been getting professional people. 
There was even a kid fresh out 
of journalism school who wants 
to start up a paper. Jaimie, how 
did you do it? Were we so far 
wrong as that?" 

"You did it yourself, Rod. You 



THE MERCHANTS OF VENUS 



told me how — but you wouldn't 
have believed, then. Or if you 
had, we never would have sold it 
to Carlson. Remember, you said 
if there were only a recent pioneer civilization around, you'd 
run to them with ink-blots and 
vocabulary tests? All you needed to do was duplicate the kind 
of person who settled America 
or Australia or California. 

"Well, as a historian I knew 
those people. And I knew what 
brought them. So I merely put 
out the same kind of bait." 

"The same kind of bait!" Rod 
exclaimed. "What about freedom 
of religion and freedom from oppression? Isn't that what brought 
people to this country? There's 
no oppression to flee from these 
days! And even if it was the same 
bait, why weren't the same kind 
of people attracted? You saw 
that first compound full — where 
in that cesspool was Thomas 
Paine, or Franklin, or Miles 
Standish?" 

"Franklin was born here," 
Jaimie grinned. "Paine didn't 
come over in the first wave. And 
I suppose General Carlson was 
Miles Standish. Maybe that kid 
journalist you saw was Paine's 
counterpart. No, Rod — the bait I 
held out attracted the same kind 
of people initially as it always 
has. You have been compromising all along on the factors you 
really wanted in order to get 



young, healthy, moral people to 
Venus. The answer is simply this: 
Pioneers are not necessarily 
young, healthy, or moral. So you 
didn't get what you wanted. 

"You see, America wasn't only 
founded by pilgrims. They were 
actually a minority here. We were 
settled by promoters, trappers, 
bonded servants, exiled British deportees, pickpockets and 
thieves. We were explored by 
French and Spanish pirates. The 
better element in Europe didn't 
come here at first — why should 
they? It was dangerous. Pioneering was to the advantage of the 
worst elements. They came by 
court order, out of necessity, for 
adventure. They came for gold 
more than for freedom; for a new 
chance more than for a new religion. 

"Australia was set up as a 
penal colony. Others went there 
for gold, or to start over where 
they weren't known. That's the 
kind of person who settles a new 
land — the misfits: too impulsive, 
drunkards, weaklings, convicts, 
and fugitives from justice. Too 
sick in mind and body to make 
a go of it where they are. 

"So we announced that there 
was a brand new world with a 
new chance for everyone on it. 
We implied that there was 
wealth. We told them everything 
about Venus that brought the 
English to America, the Spanish

to South America, the Easterners 
to the West, and the Middlewesterners to California. We didn't 
hunt for pioneers. They came to 
us." 

ROD refilled his glass thoughtfully. "But what kind of a 
society will men like that create? 
A fighting, lawless structure . . ." 

"That's right. And the lawless 
will eliminate themselves by their 
very activities. Like the early 
West. While the doctors come in 
to treat wounds, and the lawyers 
to plead their cases; while their 
wives and the other wives will 
start schools and bring in schoolteachers. That society will purge 
itself, Rod — many of the worst 
will become good citizens out of 
meeting the challenge of a new 
planet, and the rest will disappear." 

"Well, then, what about the 
gold story?" Rod asked. "Won't 
they be angry with everyone connected with the project because 
of the hoax?" 

"That was a little raw, but no 
worse than other gold rushes — 
few of the stampeders ever found 
the gold they went after. The 
captain of one of the rockets told 
me that the first few months the 
colonists were trying to stow 
away on the returning ships. Now 
they send messages to friends and 



relatives to come before the opportunity is gone — that's why 
you've seen this better element. 
Our lies will soon be forgotten, 
and crops and foods and minerals will be coming from Venus, 
and better people will go to meet 
the diminished challenge on our 
brave new world." 

Rod stood up. "Well, my compliments for a job well done, 
Jaimie. When do you expect to 
go and live there yourself? You'll 
have to soon, won't you, to complete the Project Record in residence?" 

Jaimie nodded. "About six 
months from now, I think. 
Why?" 

"Good," Rod exclaimed. "We 
can all go together." 

"What are you planning to do? 
Volunteer?" 

"The whole personnel staff will 
be going. Here's just what we 
need — a young pioneer society! 
We can get adequate data for 
future selection, a better idea of 
what kind of person a colony 
needs at different stages of 
growth." Rod grinned. "After all, 
your method was pretty sloppy, 
even if it did work. And you sent 
far too many wrong people. 
Once we have some good data 
. . . anything you can do, we can 
do better!"
