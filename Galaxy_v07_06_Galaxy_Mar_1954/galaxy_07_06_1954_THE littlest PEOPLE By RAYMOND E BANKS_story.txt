THE littlest PEOPLE By RAYMOND E. BANKS 

WHENEVER Old Mott 
came to the asteroid 
with his little people, I 
always made Dad take me with 
him. I was fascinated with the 
little people. I was too fascinated. 
It finally made trouble. 

My father was Personnel Director of the local Asteroid 
Mines, Inc. diggings on our tiny 
planet. He was one of the most 



important persons under the 
Dome. The workers and families 
of Point Montana always lifted 
their hats and smiled to him, and 
it was fun to be walking beside 
him and see the respect he got. 
Only the General Manager got 
more, and he was bald and they 
kidded about "Old Hat." But no 
one ever kidded with my father. 
We climbed up the steps of 



50 




 



Mott's space-burned old craft 
with a feeling of importance, at 
least on my part, because no one 
was allowed aboard an Employment rocket except the Personnel Director of the asteroid and 
one or two other high officials. 

Old Mott met us at the entrance and bowed and grinned, 
his funny, old-fashioned glasses 
glittering and his almost toothless mouth shapeless in the smile. 
Then there was a long waste of 
talk while they had a glass of 
wine together. Meanwhile I was 
anxiously waiting, watching the 
door that burned so bright in my 
imagination. On the other side of 
its prosaic gray metal the little 
people rested. 

"No technicians," apologized 
Mott. "I can give you some 
cooks, and some helpers and some 
housewife - hopefuls this trip. 
Many fine ones." 

My father shook his head. 
"Unskilled labor is a drug here, 
Mott. Like everywhere. I feel 
sorry for the poor devils, but I 
can't take any, especially the 
housewife-hopefuls." 

Old Mott looked disappointed. 
"Some of these people have been 
in space for many years," he 
muttered. "Too many. It ain't 
fair, Chet." 

"Send them back to Earth." 

Old Mott shook his head and 
sighed. Finally he and my father 
rose, and we went into the heav


ily locked room where the little 

people were. 

|"kLD Mott had them arranged 
by profession. It was a 
small room, not over ten by ten. 
and three walls were filled with 
shelves. The little people were 
propped up along the shelves, 
with tiny name-plates beneath 
each one. They were about seven 
inches high and stood rigid like 
so many dolls. Only they weren't 
dolls; they were real people. 

They were the poor, the unskilled, the have-not hopefuls. 
They couldn't get jobs on Earth. 
They couldn't pay their way to 
the planets. So they signed contracts with Greater New York 
Employment or one of those outfits and traveled from planet to 
planet and out through the asteroids looking for work. In one 
of these Employment ships, when 
they were reduced in size, you 
could get a couple of hundred; 
and as little people they needed 
very little food or oxygen. Fullsized in life, the ship wouldn't 
take two dozen. And so they 
traveled, in a fitful sleep, reduced 
in size, reduced in hope, trying 
to find a place to work and settle down and make a home. 

Old Mott covered his stocks of 
little people with cellophane. 
That was so when Father or anybody picked one up, it wouldn't 
get dirty from handling. Some

times you almost thought their 
tiny eyes watched you. Other 
times, you couldn't be sure. In 
reduction they were supposed to 
sleep, with the agent doing all 
of the interviewing for them. 

I wandered down the aisles, 
staring at the little people from 
Earth, while my father and Old 
Mott argued about a handful of 
laborers — all that Dad was going 
to buy this trip. 

I was never allowed to touch 
the stock. It was a very important rule. Everybody felt a little ashamed about the little 
people and was sorry because 
they couldn't find a place to live. 
You were very careful not to handle them unnecessarily. 

But down on the end one of 
them had fallen on the floor. I 
picked it up. It was a woman, 
maybe a girl. She was staring 
right at me with bold blue eyes 
and a smile. I would swear that 
she looked at me and winked. 
Hands trembling to feel that unspeakable warm life in my hand, 
I hastened to put her back on 
the shelf. 

There was no place for her. 
Old Mott was getting pretty old 
at the time, and, I guess, careless. All the spots were filled and 
he must have let her fall to the 
floor and his weak old eyes didn't 
see her. 

I wondered how long she'd been 
there. 



¥ WALKED back to where my 
father and Old Mott were. 
My father and the old man had 
selected three laborers and were 
studying them through magnifying glasses, my father telling Old 
Mott how defective they were, 
and Old Mott insisting that they 
were real good merchandise. Just 
as I came up to them there was 
a commotion outside the ship. 
Some men yelled. I was curious; 
but I wanted to tell Old Mott 
about the tiny woman first. 
"Father—" 

"Please, son," said my father. 
"Don't interrupt." 

He was always touchy in the 
little room. It was, I think, the 
aura of failure and hopelessness. 
It was the embarrassment of having to touch and handle and scan 
the tiny bodies of other people 
less fortunate than him, and deciding their fates in dollars and 
cents. 

"Mr. Mott—" 

"Go see who's climbing the 
ship, son," he ordered without 
looking. "I haven't got much 
time left. I'm due back on Mars 
Friday — " 

I should have put the tiny figure on the table. But there was 
an unholy fascination in holding 
that hot little figure in my hand 
— a person born before me, an 
adult, and here she was a tiny 
foot-ruler of life in my hand. So 
I went out to see what the trou


52 




 



ble was about, still holding her. 

It was the Sheriff. He was 
herding along two men who 
hadn't worked out well on the 
asteroid. He had them in handcuffs, and they were fighting and 
cursing as he prodded them into 
the ship. My father and Old 
Mott came out and set down on 
the table the three tiny figures 
my father had chosen. 

Then Old Mott and the Sheriff 
and my father dragged the two 
men into the Converter and shut 
the door. I could hear the explosive cries of the rejected men 
who had gotten into trouble on 
our asteroid. Then the machinery cut over them, whining with 
a scary sound that made me 
shake all over. Once I heard a 
scream. 

Pretty soon they all came out 
again. The Sheriff went away, 
saying, "I hope you pick better 
ones this time, Mr. Blake." 

Old Mott had two tiny figures 
in his hands. He wrapped them 
in cellophane and put them in 
his pocket. 

"It'll be a cold day in January before I sell them two again," 
he said. "They been getting into 
trouble everywhere I take 'em. 
Let 'em cool for a while." 

Then he and my father took 
the three new little figures and 
went back in the Converter. The 
machinery whined again, but this 
time it sounded different. Pretty 



soon they came out, and I blinked. I always blinked when I saw 
those tiny figures go into the 
Converter and come out twice as 
big as me, full-sized and smiling 
and being real deferential to 
Father. 

"This is wonderful, Mr. Blake," 
said one. "We'll sure work hard, 
Mr. Mott." 

"It was real kind of you to 
take us on, Mr. Blake," said another. "We ain't never had a 
chance before." 

rpHEY looked at my father with 
smiles that tried too hard, and 
held their hats in their hands 
and bobbed their heads. You 
could see the whites of their 
eyes like a dog's. They wore the 
faded blues and reds of workers, 
and they were clumsy on their 
feet after so many months of 
being little. They were young, 
but they looked old and tired, 
and I had to swallow in my 
throat when they looked out of 
the window and saw how small 
and gray our little asteroid was, 
and how they kept on smiling 
and bowing, and swallowing their 
disappointment at their new 
home. 

Father smiled back at them, 
but he'd heard it all before. Some 
of them would start drinking. 
Some of them would get in trouble with women. Some of them 
would get bored and make trou

ble. Not one in ten ever really 
liked our asteroid and really became one of us. 

Maybe it was partly our fault, 
because it made a big difference 
how you came to the asteroid. 
If you came in a regular rocket, 
full-sized and with luggage, it 
was easier. Those were the engineers and doctors and scientists, and they were important in 
the Dome. But the little people 
made big lived on the sides of 
the Dome, where there was less 
oxygen, and they didn't ever 
make much or have much. 

My father and I said good-by 
to Mr. Mott and climbed down 
the loading ladder. Old Mott 
peered after us through his glasses 
and smiled and waved, and my 
father waved the contracts up at 
him — the contracts that said that 
Father would deduct Old Mott's 
money from the laborers' wages 
every month, and also pay the 
Greater New York Employment 
its fee. 

Then we started back for Point 
Montana, the new workers unsteady on their legs and still 
trying to be nice. My father 
-walked between them, bracing 
them with his arms, and answered their questions. I brought up 
the rear. 

And that- night, nearly eight 
years ago, when I got home, I 
found Gleam in my pocket. I 
had forgotten to give her back to 



Old Mott. I had stolen one of the 
little people. 

NATURALLY, I didn't know 
what to do with her — until 
I went in my sister's playroom 
and saw her dolls. Then I gave 
her to my sister Kate and told 
her that it was a new kind of 
doll, a used-up little person that 
Old Mott had given me on the 
promise that I wouldn't tell the 
folks. I swore her to secrecy. 

Kate jumped up and down, 
hugging the little figure in cellophane. "She gleams," she cried, 
"I'll call her Gleam." 

For a while she played with 
Gleam like her other dolls, and 
our folks didn't notice because 
on Point Montana there was less 
power and fewer appliances and 
we all had to work — even my 
mother had to do her own washing by hand — and so we kids were 
left pretty much to entertain ourselves. 

I figured Kate would get tired 
of Gleam and I could return her 
to Old Mott on his next trip. I 
worried quite a lot in the meantime, because I knew they had 
rigid laws about handling the 
little people. 

The very day Old Mott came 
back, Kate brought Gleam to me. 

"Look," she said. "I was dumping my stuff in the toy box, and 
your dump-truck fell on her." 

There was something wrong 



54 




 



with one of the legs. Gleam had 
straight, slim legs — but now one 
of them was oddly crooked. I 
ran to Dad's library and got the 
magnifying glass. 

Gleam was good-looking, with 
a curved generous mouth that 
smiled and blue eyes that always 
had a far-off look of waking 
sleep. But now she was turning 
the lips in, and the cheek hollows 
stood out in pain, and there was 
sweat on her forehead. The blue 
eyes were closed. I got scared. 
I knew she was going to die. 

"I'm going to tell Mother," 
said Kate, looking at my face 
and beginning to whimper. "I 
didn't bring her here, and I don't 
like her any more." 

"All right, stupid, tell her," I 
said in misery. I was thinking 
what it would be like to go to 
prison — but Kate wouldn't understand that. 

"Mom will probably stop our 
going to the videopix for three 
months," I said. That was something she could understand. 

Kate stopped whimpering. 
"You can have her," she said. 
"You can do whatever you want. 
I won't say anything." 

T DIDN'T plan to give her back 
to Old Mott before I asked 
some questions. I casually asked 
him about the whole process, 
and then about injuries to the 
little people. He'd been reduced 



once himself, a long time ago. 

"Don't feel a thing," he said. 
"The Converter goes on, and you 
go to sleep while your molecules 
close up and a lot of water is 
taken out of you. Then you just 
drift and dream, slow, lazy, easylike, until you get your full size 
again." 

"What if they got hurt?" 

"It might wake 'em up," he 
chuckled. "But ain't nobody 
gonna buy damaged goods, so 
they just better not get hurt." 

That scared me more. If I gave 
her back to him, he couldn't get 
her a job now. 

"Say, Chet," he asked my father, "I didn't leave a girl with 
you last time, did I? I got one 
missin'. Cute little blonde, she 
was." 

My father smiled and shook 
his head. "You know I never take 
the cute ones. They only get the 
men to fighting, and make trouble. You probably bootlegged her 
to some slave-trader." 

Old Mott laughed and winked 
and said he'd filled out a missing 
persons report, but, for all of 
him, one missing was just one 
less to worry about. 

"Won't they- — won't they send 
you to prison for that?" I asked, 
round-eyed. 

Old Mott roared. "Prison? 
Naw, son, who cares about the 
little people?" 

After that, I was determined 



THE LITTLEST PEOPLE 



55 



not to give her back to him. 

I got a first aid book and set 
Gleam's leg, using some of 
Mom's nailboards for splints. 
Then I put her in a pigeon-hole 
in my desk in my room, so I 
could check up on her. I even 
fed her with an eye-dropper like 
I'd seen Old Mott do once. 

"Sugar and water once every 
month," he had once said. "God, 
ain't it a shame us reliable folk 
got to eat so much expensive 
stuff when they get by on sugar 
and water?" 

TT was about two weeks after 
that when I got my next 
shock. I had checked on Gleam 
and found her eyes open and 
her face back to normal. Since 
she didn't move at all, I figured 
her leg was healing. 

Then one night I sat down to 
do my homework and found a 
scrap of paper on my desk in 
front of the pigeon-hole. I could 
see some tiny scratches on it — 
some writing. I got the magnifying glass, my heart thumping. 

"An injury might wake 'em 
up," Old Mott had said. 

I read the note: 

LittI boy. You brok my 

leg. Give me bak to the 

Mployment. 

With trembling hands, I pulled 
her out of the pigeon-hole. I 
could feel the warmth of her 
body, and felt that I could even 



see her breathe. She was awake! 
I looked at her through the magnifying glass and tried to talk 
to her, but I could see the tiny 
head shake. She kept trying to 
raise her hand, and at last I saw 
she wanted the pencil. 

Littl boy, she wrote in tiny, 
tiny script. / cant heer you. Rite 
me note. Reel small note. 

I guessed then that my voice 
must sound like roaring in her 
ears. 

I wrote her: / can't give you 
back till the next employment 
rocket. Are you all right? 

She wrote: I hurt. Im lonly. J 
want to go home. 

At that point I felt very sorry 
for her, and I felt guilty too. I 
held my breath while she took 
off the splint and tried her leg. 

She moved slowly and with a 
limp. She walked the whole 
length of the desk, but the limp 
didn't go away. She put her 
hands to her tiny blonde head 
and shook as if in terror. 

Wide-eyed, I pushed the writing pad to her. 

I'm rooned, she wrote in 
panic. / limp. Littl boy youve 
rooned my life. 

Maybe it'll get better, I told 
her, sick myself. 

/ was beetiful, she wrote, but 
whos gone marry a crippld girl? 

I was utterly miserable. Her 
leg looked all right, but the limp 
wouldn't go away. In my child

like reasoning. I had ruined her 
life, and in my guilt I didn't 
know what to do. I couldn't tell 
Old Mott; I couldn't tell my 
father. Through damaging her 
leg, I had deprived her of a 
chance to get hired through Employment, and my father was 
the kind of man who took grim 
satisfaction in his principles. 

"We are leaders," he would say, 
"and we must have principles. 
I would as soon send my own 
son to prison as allow injustice 
to pass." 

It was this shuddery thought 
of his detached anger that imprisoned me with my problem. 
The only thing I could think of 
was to make Gleam into a 
schoolteacher. Miss Griswold, our 
teacher, had a withered arm and 
was very old. She was saving up 
to return to Earth. I figured that 
when I got to be a little older 
and understudied my father in 
his job as Personnel Director, I 
could take care of Gleam, and it 
wouldn't matter if she limped. 
Such is the selfish judgment of 
tender years. 

I told Gleam of my idea. 

No, she wrote. / was waittres. 
I dont want scool. I will kill you 
if you dont let me go. 

I thought her threat was idle. 

T ATE at night, there is a 
change of machinery in the 
asteroid Dome. All the lights go 



off, and the oxygen goes up, and 
they blow the scent of mountain 
pine trees through the ventilators. I remember waking in the 
middle of the night with a weight 
on my chest, and drawing the 
pure air into my lungs and feeling that something was horribly 
wrong. 

Gleam stood on my chest. Her 
figure was silhouetted against the 
dim starlight outside my window. 
She had my pocketknife. She 
was throwing her whole weight 
on it to stab me with the open 
blade, and before I could stop 
her, it plunged into my chest. 

I screamed. Stupid, ignorant, 
revengeful Gleam — she had 
meant her threat of killing me! 

When my parents came running, I clutched her hot body in 
my hand under the covers. I 
could feel my own blood on my 
pajamas and I was scared and 
sick and angry. But the act of 
pulling up the covers had dislodged the knife, and I realized 
that I was not seriously hurt. 

I told my parents I'd had a 
nightmare. 

"Dreaming of the little people," my mother said to my fa-' 
ther. "You see, I told you he 
was too young to go on the Employment Rocket!" 

My father shrugged and insisted that a son of his should be 
strong-minded, and they went 
back to bed. 



THE LITTLEST PEOPLE

I got up on the edge of my 
bed and leaned over and vomited, 
feeling hatred and an underlying 
abysmal guilt toward , the soft, 
squirming thing I held in my 
hands. 

From the moment she plunged 
the knife blade in me, I was 
filled with anger and determination that she would not ruin my 
life, even by revealing her existence to my parents, who, I 
thought, would send me to 
prison. My idea of making her 
into a schoolteacher and hiring 
her to replace Miss Griswold, 
when I should have the power in 
a few years, grew from a promise 
snatched out of the air into real 
purpose. 

She objected violently, first 
crying and then cursing me so 
loudly that I could faintly hear 
the words. As I heard the squeaking vileness pour from her tiny 
lips, my hate toward her deepened into an almost holy reverence for my mission. She had 
been a poor girl ; she had not 
had much education ; she only 
wanted to marry and settle down, 
or at least get a job as a waitress, which was the only thing 
she knew. 

My feeling of pity for all the ' 
little folk, embarrassment at their 
poor possessions and awkward 
ways and helplessness, centered 
on her — her shallow and vile being. As I chained her to the desk 



with a solid gold-plated watchchain that night, I had accepted 
the problem of her existence. 

Next evening I went to work. 

You are still good-looking, I 
wrote her, bur you are stupid. 
I will make you less stupid. I will 
teach you how to be as smart and 
polite as Mrs. Ellensberg, the 
Chief Chemist's wife. 

Thus stirred by my emotions 
of fear, anger and pity, I laid out 
her schedule. When she refused to 
cooperate, I took the tiny arm 
and twisted it until she screamed. 
After that, she did what I wanted. 

The period of childhood has a 
prisonlike quality of "do"s and 
"don'f's, and my own discipline 
had been no less severe than that 
which I passed on to her. I made 
her do my homework with me; 
I made her take exercise ; and 
every night promptly at nine, I 
shut her in my bureau drawer. 

In no other home on Point 
Montana could I have gotten 
away with it. But my parents 
were very busy people, and they 
left their children to amuse themselves, seldom even coming into 
our rooms. My sister Kate, of 
course, knew all about Gleam; 
but she was under my control, as 
younger sisters often are, and the 
secret was kept. 

i"VF course, there were crises. 

One time my parents found 
the cat with its throat slit. I had 



58 




 



to talk fast to get out of that one. 
I was going to put Gleam on 
bread and water for that sin, 
but when I saw the long, deep 
scratches that the cat had given 
her in its playful way, I said 
nothing. 

Then there was the time that 
she got loose and filled her thimble with Father's wine. I usually fed her with scraps from 
the table, for sugar and water 
wouldn't do for Gleam now that 
she moved around and was 
awake. I kept the thimble in her 
drawer for her to have her milk 
in. 

She came weaving into the 
study, slopping wine out of her 
thimble and singing a song that 
astounded my unsophisticated 
ears. 

"Little boy," she said in her 
tiny voice, "I'm going to spit in 
your eye." She stood on her tiptoes, her blonde hair hanging 
loose, laughing. "Wow, what a 
party," she cried enthusiastically. 
"What a crime!" 

I barely had time to scoop her 
up and hide her in the bureau 
before my father came snooping 
suspiciously into the room. 

He smiled when he saw me 
with a thimbleful of wine. 

"The young must learn by imitation," he said, "but you'll never 
get in much trouble if you only 
take a thimbleful at a time, 
John." 



Then he gave me my first real 
wineglass full of wine, and I knew 
I was growing up. 

We had a man-to-man talk in 
his study that night, about my 
future and my relations with 
Lucy Ellensberg, whom I had 
dated at school, and how I would 
go to work in Employment after 
I had been to school on Ceres. I 
almost told him about Gleam 
then, but when I started to talk 
about the little people, he got a 
pained look in his eye. 

"I'm sorry, John," he said, "but 
you mustn't go overboard for 
them. They're people — but they're 
ignorant, superstitious and undisciplined. They must be treated 
differently." 

Afterward, back in my room, I 
found Gleam crying in the bureau drawer. She was still drunk. 

"I am going to kill myself, 
little boy," she wept. "Nobody 
loves me." 

"You have a home here," I 
told her. "You are being trained 
for a good job. Soon you'll be 
able to teach school and marry 
someone who doesn't mind your 
limp." 

She shook her head. "Someday 
you'll pay for this, little boy," 
she said, and then hiccupped and 
fell over and went to sleep. I 
couldn't help grinning. I reached 
in and brushed back her hair and 
eased her tiny figure into a more 
comfortable position. 



THE LITTLEST PEOPLE

TT was when I went to school 
on Ceres that the change took 
place. Up until that time Gleam 
was like a pet, very little more to 
me than a frog or dog. But on 
Ceres, I had my first real drunk 
and my first real date; on Ceres 
it was / who didn't want to work, 
feeling the freedom of a real city, 
strange people, exciting things. 

Gleam became my conscience. 
And I didn't particularly like it. 

I had taken her to Ceres with 
many misgivings, not because I 
wanted to but because I was 
afraid to leave her behind. There 
were ~many other little people 
there, kept by the people of Ceres 
as pets just as I kept Gleam. 
Most of them were alcoholics or 
the demented who did not wish 
to become big again. So I was 
able to keep Gleam openly. 

And now, at last, I began to 
think of getting rid of her. 

The second day, I was walking 
down the astonishingly wide 
street with its gash of neon red 
and blue and green signs. Gleam, 
as usual, was standing in my 
pocket and leaning her elbows on 
the edge as she looked out. We 
came to the Ceres office of the 
Greater New York Employment. 
Suddenly, I stopped. 

"Gleam," I said, speaking softly and a little high-pitched, the 
way I'd found she could best 
understand me. "Maybe it's time 
for you to be big again." 



"No! Not now, little boy, it 
isn't time." 

The tiny voice was almost a 
cry of terror. Something about it 
puzzled me. 

When I asked her what was 
wrong, she wouldn't talk to me. 

That night, I told my roommate, Rand, about it. 

He shrugged. "They get afraid. 
They get used to being taken care 
of. She won't ever want to be big 
again." 

Now, for the first time, I was 
eager to get rid of Gleam; and 
she wouldn't go. She put on airs 
on Ceres. She acted very strangely, insisting on complete privacy 
for dressing and undressing, and 
when we traveled she preferred 
to ride on my neck, holding onto 
my ear and shouting wry comments at me. 

"That Alice you been eying," 
she said one day. "She's a common slut. You've got a future at 
Point Montana; she's after you. 
Better watch out, little boy." 

"I can take care of myself." 

"Those clothes!" she laughed, 
pointing to another girl that I 
had been trying to be introduced 
to. "She dresses like a waitress. 
And listen to her language! Split 
infinitives and dangling participles all over the place. One would 
do well to ignore these street women, little boy!" 

After that, I didn't dare ask 
the girl for a date.

GLEAM helped me with my 
lessons. She goaded me into 
doing them. She criticized my 
clothes and my manners and, 
since she knew cities and I did 
not, even told me where to go 
around the town. This was annoying to me — but with her help 
I did well in school, and, due to 
her knowledge of the seamier side 
of life, achieved a certain fame 
among my contemporaries as a 
man of the world. 

She became increasingly meddlesome, and we had arguments 
often. Especially when I had 
dates and left her behind. I would 
come home to find her pacing my 
desk. "Well," she would sneer, 
"did the little darling find out 
how much you wilj^rgake and 
how big a home ypu own and hc^ 1

the bank?" 
"Never mind.'* 

"You're an idiot, little boy. 
You have apples for brains." 

We finally had it out on my 
last week at school. 

"Gleam," I said, "when I go 
back, I'll have to get married, 
you know. That is, I can't hold 
a job in Employment unless I'm 
married. And Lucy Ellensberg is 
sort of — " 

"What happens to me?" she 
cried. 

"You'll have to get big and get 
a job. I kept you because I 
ruined your life. But in our house 
you've learned enough to get by 
as a schoolteacher or a governess. You've learned how the other 
half lives. I've paid for my sin in 
stealing you and breaking your 
leg." 

"You could do better than 
Lucy Ellensberg!" 

"I don't want to do better." 

She picked up her thimble and 
tossed off the spate of beer I'd 
poured for her. 

"There's me, for instance," she 
said. "After all, I know your 
habits — " 

I burst into laughter. "You! 
Marry you! Why, Gleam, I think 
of you as a sister, with your bad 
leg and — " 

Then I stopped laughing. Because she was staring at me with 
something in her tiny eyes that 



I'd never seen before. All the 
years, we'd fought every step of 
the way. I had found her vile and 
obscene. She had found me childishly cruel. I had made her life 
hell at home, and she had made 
mine hell on Ceres. Always it had 
been with a veiled contempt on 
both sides. 

But this time her look was 
different. 

"I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry 
you said that." 

Before, I had always been 
"Little Boy." And I had always 
called her Gleam, because I knew 
her real name was impossibly 
corny. 

My chest felt hot. I was embarrassed. "I'm sorry too, Millicent," I said. "But this is as far 
as we can go together." 

rpHE next day I took her to 
Employment, and she didn't 
complain. A thick distance lay 
between us. 

They accepted her. The last 
time I ever saw tiny Gleam was 
as she strode importantly up and 
down the Director's desk, limping but waving her hands in 
earnest and giving them complete 
instructions on the important job 
she wanted. Somewhere far away. 

"As far away as possible from 
provincial bumpkins like John 
Blake!" she cried to the Director. 
"You will make a good deal of 
money from me, my good man!"

His jaw dropped, and the others 
in the room gathered around the 
self-important, strutting little figure as I slipped out to freedom. 

I was oddly disturbed at the 
parting, yet oddly pleased. The 
years of discipline had paid off 
for Gleam. She'd always had a 
good brain, just an undeveloped 
one; now she was fast, capable, 
bursting with confidence. I knew 
she'd get along. 

The next months were exceedingly enjoyable. For the first time 
in more than seven years, I didn't 
have to worry about Gleam. At 
first, I missed the business of 
feeding her and taking care of 
her wants ; but far more than that 
I enjoyed being able to exercise 
privacy. I read what I wanted, kept the hours that I wanted, 
and dated the girls I wanted. 

Finally I returned to start my 
new job in Employment on Point 
Montana. 

"I won't ask too many questions about Ceres," smiled my 
father, who was noticeably older. 
"You seem to have matured 
astonishingly for your age. Ceres 
was good for you, John. By the 
way, Lucy Ellensberg is coming 
over for supper tonight." 

I had anticipated that night 
for a long time. Lucy seemed 
lovely; she had charm and manners; I was only a little disappointed to see how much her 
thoughts revolved around petty 



matters of the Point, and how 
soft and selfish she seemed. 

It was all very routine. We 
were alone; the night lights of 
Point Montana gleamed in fuzzy 
softness; we stood in my parents' 
tiny garden and smelled the pine 
scent of the ventilators, and I 
proposed and was accepted. 

"We'll live in a small house by 
the edge of the Dome at first," 
I told her. "I want to get the feel 
of the workmen's lives, since I'll 
be hiring them." 

"Well," she said dubiously. 
"Only for a very short time, John. 
After all, there's our part of the 
social calendar to keep up!" 

"And then we'll have to get 
started on a family." 

She laughed: "Later, John. It's 
all right for you — you've been 
out to see the world and had 
your fling. But for me it's the 
first time away from home. I 
want parties! I want to learn to 
get drunk and have some real 
fun — " 

It went on that way, and suddenly I saw Lucy as she really 
was. Suddenly I realized that 
Gleam had left her mark on me, 
despite her ignorance of social 
ways. In day-to-day close contact with Gleam's adult mind, I 
had gone a long way past the 
kids of my own age on the Point. 

Lucy would be fine when she 
grew up a little more. 

After she left, I noted that we

had been standing near the spot 
where I had buried the cat Gleam 
had killed many years before. 
Alone in the garden, smoking a 
cigarette, I stared up through the 
Dome at the stars and wondered 
what Gleam was doing that night. 
It was certain that she wasn't 
worrying about the size of house 
she lived in — Gleam hungered for 
any sort of a shack of her own. 

What would I do if Gleam 
should come this way again? I 
didn't know. Up until tonight, 
I'd thought I had planned my 
life with Lucy. 

I remembered then that the 
Greater New York Employment 
rocket was due next week, and I 
put out my cigarette and went in, 
a sort of expectant fear surging 
inside. 

ll/|Y father and I were there 
when the rocket landed. Old 
Mott was dead, of course, but 
young Billy Stanger grinned and 
poured the wine, and we sat and 
talked while I leafed through the 
list of names and occupations on 
the printed sheets. Trying to look 
casual, I turned to the "Schoolteachers" section. 

MMicent Hamm leaped out of 
the page at me. 

I kept my voice steady, hut I 
couldn't keep excitement out of it. 

"I need a schoolteacher," I said. 
I thrust the paper at him. "Try 
this one. I'm sure she'll be all 



right. I won't go in the room if 
you don't mind. Just put her 
through the Converter." 

Employment people see much, 
say little. Stanger nodded and 
went out. Presently he came out 
of the stock room, carrying something in his hand, and went into 
the Converter. I heard the machinery squeal and slowly got to 
my feet. The door opened. 

For comfort she was wearing 
brienes of pleasing black and 
white, bootlets, and a ribbon in 
her hair. The eyes were hard and 
suspicious, stuffed with a knowledge of me. The legs were youthful and graceful, but there was a 
slight limp. She was tall, a walking dream from my memories, 
barely three inches shorter than 
I, moving with assurance and 
poise. 

The Gleam I had made stood 
and stared at the John Blake 
she had made. 

"Well, little boy," she said in a 
voice that sounded loud because 
I'd always heard it thinner, "I 
see you got trapped in this forlorn dump for the rest of your 
life." 

"So have you," I said, walking 
toward her. My father and 
Stanger were staring. 

She raised her arms. Her eyes 
got wet. 

"So have I," said the new 
Gleam.
