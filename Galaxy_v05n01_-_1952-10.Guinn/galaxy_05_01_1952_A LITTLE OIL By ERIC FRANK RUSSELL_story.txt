A LITTLE OIL By ERIC FRANK RUSSELL 


Isn't it strange that princes and 
kings 

And clowns that caper in sawdust 
rings 

And ordinary folk like you and 
me 

Are builders of eternity. 

To each is given a bag of tools, 
An hour-glass and a book of 



And each must burfd ere his time 
has flown 

A stumbling-block or a steppingstone. 

Anon. 



THE SHIP hummed and 
thrummed and drummed. 
It was a low-cycle note,

sonorous and penetrating like 
that produced by the big-pipe 
octave of a mighty organ. It 
moaned through hull-plates, 
groaned out of girders, throbbed 
along nerves and bones, -beat 
upon tired ears and could not be 
ignored. Not after a week, a 
month or a year. Certainly not 
after most of four years. 

There was no effective cure for 
the noise. It was the inevitable, 
unavoidable result of bottling an 
atomic propulsor within a cylinder of highly conductive metal. 
The first ship had screeched one 
hundred cycles higher, minute 
after minute, hour after hour, and 
had never returned. Somewhere 
amid the waste spaces of the infinite, it might still be howling, 
unheard, unheeded, after thirty 
years. 

Ship number two had started 
out with a slag-wool padded engine room and silicone-lined Venturis. The low note. The drone of 
a burdened bee amplified twenty 
thousand times. And the bee had 
not come back to the hive. 
Eighteen years into the star field 
and blindly heading onward for 
another hundred, thousand or ten 
thousand years. 

The vessel now thundering 
along was number three, not going outward, but on its way back, 
heading for home. Nosing toward

fumbling for salvation, it was determined not to be damned as 
others -had been damned. Ship 
number three — that meant something. 

Sea sailors cherish sea superstitions. Space sailors coddle 
space superstjtions. In the captain's cabin where Kinrade 
sat writing the log, a superstition was pinned to the wall and 
functioned as a morale booster. 

THIRD TIME DOES IT! 

They had believed it at the 
start when the crew had numbered nine. They would believe it at 
the finish, though reduced to six. 
But in between times there had 
been and might again be bad 
moments of shaken faith when 
men wanted out at any cost, even 
the cost of death, and to hell 
with the ultimate purpose of the 
flight. Moments when men fought 
other men in effort to break loose 
from audiophobia, claustrophobia, half a dozen other phobias. 

KINRADE wrote with the pen 
in his right hand, a bluedsteel automatic within easy reach 
of his left. His eyes concentrated 
on the log, his ears on the ship 
and its everlasting drumming. 
The noise might hesitate, falter 
or cease, and the blessing of its 
cessation would be equally a 
curse. Or other sounds might rise

above this persistent background, 
an oath, a shout, a shot. It had 
happened once before, when 
Weygarth cracked. It could happen again. 

Kinrade was somewhat edgy 
himself, for he jerked in his seat 
and slid his left hand sidewise 
when Bertelli came in unexpectedly. Recovering, he swung his 
chair round on its socket, gazed 
into the other's sad gray eyes. 

"Well, have they marked it 
yet?" 

The question startled Bertelli. 
His long, lugubrious, hollowcheeked face grew longer. His 
great gash of a mouth drooped at 
the corners. The sad eyes took 
on an expression of hopeless bafflement. He was clumsily embarrassed. 

Recognizing these familiar 
symptoms, Kinrade became more 
explicit. "Is Sol visible on the 
screen?" 

"Sol?" Bertelli's hands tangled 
together, the fingers like carrots. 

"Our own sun, you imbecile!" 

"Oh, that!" The eyes widened 
in delighted comprehension. "I 
haven't asked." 

"I thought maybe you'd come 
to tell me they've got it spotted 
at last." 

"No, Captain. It's just that I 
wondered whether you need any 
help." His expression switched 
from its accustomed glumness to 
the eager smile of a fool more 



than willing to serve. The mouth 
lifted, widened so much that it 
made the ears stick out and reminded the onlooker of a slice 
of melon. 

"Thanks," said Kinrade, more 
kindly. "Not right now." 

Bertelli's embarrassment came 
back in painful strength. His face 
was humbly apologetic for having asked. After shifting around 
on his big, ugly feet, he went out. 
As always, he skidded violently 
on the steel-floored catwalk, regained balance with a clatter of 
heavy boots. Nobody else slipped 
at that spot, but he invariably 
did. 

Kinrade suddenly realized that 
he was smiling and changed it to 
a troubled frown. For the hundredth time he consulted the 
ship's register, found it no more 
informative than on the ninetynine other occasions. There was 
the little roster with three names 
of the nine crossed out. And the 
same entry halfway down: En~ 
rico Bertelli, thirty-two, psychologist. 

It was the bunk. If Bertelli 
were a psychologist or anything 
remotely connected with scientific expertness, then he, Robert 
Kinrade, was a bright blue giraffe. For almost four years 
they'd been locked together in 
this groaning cylinder, six men 
carefully chosen from the great 
mass of humanity, six men sup

posed to be the salt of the Earth, 
the cream of their kind. But the 
six were five men and a fool. 

There was a puzzle here. It intrigued him in spare moments 
when he had time to think with 
a mind untrammeled by serious 
matters. It dangled before him 
tantalizingly, making him repeatedly picture its subject all the 
way down from sad eyes to flat 
feet. During rare moments of. 
meditation, he found himself 
vainly trying to analyze Bertelli 
and deduce the real reason for his 
being, concentrating upon him to 
the temporary exclusion of the 
others. 

As opportunity occurred, Kinrade watched him, too, marveling that any so-called expert 
could be so thoroughly and unfailingly nit-witt'ed. He studied 
Bertelli with such intentness that 
he failed to notice whether the 
others might be doing the same 
for similar reasons born of similar thoughts. 

Yet this concentration was his 
answer — and he did not know it. 

MARSDEN was duty navigator and Vail stood guard in 
the engine room when Kinrade 
went to lunch. The other three 
already were at the table in the 
tiny galley. He nodded briefly 
and took his place. 

Big blond Nilsen, atomic engineer by choice, plus botanist by 



official coercion, eyed Kinrade 
skeptically and said, "No sun." 
"I know."' 

"There ought to be." 
Kinrade shrugged. 
"But there isn't," Nilsen persisted. 

"I know." 
"Do you care?'' 

"Don't be a sap." Breaking 
open a packaged meal, Kinrade 
tossed it into his compartmented 
plastic plate. 

Thrum-thrum went the ship 
from floor, walls and ceiling. 

"So you think I'm a sap, do 
you?" Nilsen leaned forward, 
stared with aggressive expectancy. 

"Let's eat," suggested Aram, 
the thin, dark and nervous cosmogeologist at his side. "One 
bellyache's enough without hunting another." 

"That's not the point," declared Nilsen. "I want to know 
^ j> 
He shut up as Bertelli mumbled, "Pardon me," and reached 
across him for salt in a container 
fastened to the other end of the 
table. 

Unscrewing it, Bertelli brought 
it to his end, sat down, found 
himself on the extreme edge of 
his seat. His eyes popped very 
slightly in mild surprise. He 
stood, slid the seat forward on its 
runners, sat again, knocked the 
salt off the table. Radiating 




 



shame and self- consciousness, he 
picked it up, used it in the manner of one emptying a large 
bucket, practically lay full length 
on the table to screw it in its 
original position. That task performed, he squirmed backward 
with his behind in the air, gained 
the seat again. 

It was the edge and so near 
that he began to slide off it. The 
eyes bulged a fraction more widely than before and once again he 
went through the seat-sliding performance. Finally he sat down, 
smoothed out an invisible napkin, favored everyone with a look 
of abject apology. 

Taking in a deep breath, Nilsen said to him, "Sure you 
wouldn't care for a little more 
salt?" 

Bertelli's eyes dulled under the 
impact of the problem, sought 
his plate, examined it with idiotic care. "No, I don't think so, 
thank you." 

Surveying his own plate a moment, Nilsen looked up, met Kinrade's eyes, asked, "What's this 
guy got that others haven't got?" 

Grinning at him, Kinrade replied, "That problem is a corker. 
I've been trying to figure it out 
and I can't." 

A half -smile came into Nilsen's 
features as he confessed, "Neither 
can I." 

Bertelli said nothing. He went 
on with his meal, eating in char


acteristic manner with elbows 
held high and his hand uncertainly seeking a mouth it could not 
miss. 

PUTTING a pencil-tip to the 
screen, Marsden said, "That 
one looks pink to me. But it may 
be my imagination." 

Kinrade bent close and had a 
look. "Too small to be sure. A 
mere pinpoint." 

"Then I've been kidding myself." 

"Not necessarily. Your eyes 
may be more color-sensitive than 
mine." 

"Ask Goofy here," suggested 
Marsden. 

Bertelli examined the brilliant 
dot from ten different distances 
and as many angles. Finally he 
squinted at it. 

"That can't be it," he announced, triumphant with discovery, "because our sun is orangered." 

"The fluorescent coating of the 
Screen would make it look pink," 
informed Marsden with a touch 
of impatience. "Does that dot 
look pink?" 

"I don't know," Bertelli admitted miserably. 

"You're a great help." 

"It's too far away for more 
than mere guesswork," said Kinrade. "Resolution isn't good 
enough to cope with such a distance. We'll have to wait until 



A LITTLE OIL 



141 



we get a good deal closer." 

"I'm fed up waiting," .said 
Marsden, scowling at the screen. 

"But we're going home," Bertelli reminded him. 

"I know. That's what's" killing 
me." 

"Don't you want to go home?" 
Bertelli puzzledly asked. 

"I want to too much." Irritatedly, Marsden rammed the 
pencil back into his pocket. "I 
thought I'd stand the inward trip 
better than the outward one just 
because it would be homeward. 
I was wrong. I want gr5en grass, 
blue skies and plenty of room to 
move around. I can't wait." 

"I can," said Bertelli, virtuously. "Because I've got to. If I were 
unable to wait, I'd go nuts." 

"Would you?" Marsden looked 
him over, the grouch slowly fading from his face. The change 
went as far as a chuckle. "How 
much of a trip would that be?" 

Leaving the navigation room, 
he headed toward the galley, still 
chuckling as he went. Rounding 
the farther corner, he let out a 
low guffaw. 

"What's funny?" asked Bertelli, vacantly mystified. 

Straightening up from the 
screen, Kinrade eyed him with 
eare. "How is it that whenever 
somebody starts blowing his — " 
Changing his mind, he let the 
sentence die out. 

"Yes, Captain?" 



"Oh, forget it." 

The ship plunged onward, 
moaning at every plate. 

Vail appeared presently, coming off duty and on his way to -j 
eat. He was a short man of great 4 
width, with long arms and power- J

"Any luck?"

screen Kinrade was pointing to. 

"We will in due time. It's a bit 
early yet." 

"Changing your tune, aren't 
you?" 

"What do you mean?" Kinrade's tone was sharp. 

"Three days ago you told us 
that Sol should become visible 
in the screen almost any time. 
That gave us a lift. We needed 
it. I'm no sniveling babe myself, 
but I must admit I wanted that 
boost." He surveyed the other 
with a touch of resentment. "The 
higher hopes go, the lower they 
fall when they drop." 

"I'm not dropping mine," Kinrade said. "Three days plus or 
minus is a tiny margin of error 
in a return trip taking two years." 

"That would be true if we're 
on correct course. Maybe we 
aren't." 

"Are you suggesting that I'm 
not competent to work out the 
proper coordinates?" 

"I'm suggesting that even the 
best of us can blunder," Vail gave 
back stubbornly. "In proof of 
which, two ships have gone to 
Pot." 

"Not because of navigational 
errors," put in Bertelli, looking 
unconvincingly profound. 

Pursing his lips, Vail stared at 
him and inquired, "What the hell 
do you know about space navigation?" 

"Nothing," Bertelli confessed 



with the air of one surrendering 
a back tooth. He nodded toward 
Kinrade. "But he knows enough." 
"I wonder!" 

"npHE route for return was 
worked out in full detail by 
Captain Sanderson before he 
died," said Kinrade, his color a 
little heightened. "I've checked 
and rechecked at least a dozen 
times. So has Marsden. If you're 
not satisfied, you can have the 
calculations and go through them 
yourself." 

"I'm not a trained navigator." 

"Then shut your trap and 
leave other — " 

Bertelli broke in with a note of 
protest. "But I didn't have it 
open!" 

Shifting attention to him, Kinrade asked, "You didn't have 
what open?" » 

"My mouth," said Bertelli. He 
registered personal injury. "Don't 
know why you have to pick on 
me. Everyone picks on me." 

"You're wrong," Vail told him. 
"He—" 

"There you are. I'm wrong. 
I'm always wrong. I'm never 
right." Emitting a deep sigh, Bertelli wandered out, dragging big 
feet. His face was a picture of 
misery. > 

Vail watched him in faint 
amazement, then said, "That 
looks to me like a persecution 
complex. And he's supposed to 



144 




 



be a psychologist. What a 
laugh!" \ * 

"Yes," agreed Kinrade, without humor. "What a laugh!" 

Going to the screen, Vail examined it. "Which one does 
Marsden think is Sol?" 

"That one." Kinrade pointed it 
out for him. 

Staring at it hungrily for quite 
a time, Vail finished, "Oh, well, 
let's hope he's right." Then he 
departed. 

Left alone, Kinrade sat in the 
navigator's chair and looked at 
the screen without seeing it. His 
mind was on a problem that 
might be real or might be imaginary. 

When does science become an 
art? Or should it be: when does 
art become a science? 

A RAM cracked next day. He 
got a dose of "Charlie," the 
same psychotic behavior pattern 
that had put an end to Weygarth. 
There was a technical name for 
it, but few knew it and fewer 
could pronounce it. The slang 
term came from an ancient, almost forgotten war in which the 
rear-gunner of a big aircraftTail End Charlie— would think 
too long of the heavy bomb-load 
and the thousands of gallons of 
high octane spirit right behind 
his perspex parrot-cage, and all 
of a sudden he'd batter upon the 
walls of his prison, screaming, 



The way Aram broke was 
characteristic of this space affliction. He sat next to Nilsen, quietly downing his meal, but picking 
at the compartmented plastic 
tray as though completely indifferent to food or drink. Then, 
without a word or the slightest 
change of expression, he pushed 
away the tray, got up and ran 
like hell. Nilsen tried to trip him 
and failed. Aram shot through the 
door like a bolting rabbit, raced 
headlong down the passage toward the airlock. 

Slamming his own chair back 
to the limit of its holding rails, 
Nilsen went after him with Kinrade one jump behind. Bertelli 
stayed in his seat, a forkful of 
food halfway to his mouth, his 
gaze fixed blankly on the facing 
wall while his big ears remained 
perked for outer sounds. 

They caught Aram frantically 
struggling with the airlock wheel 
and trying to force it the wrong 
way around. Even if he had rotated it the right way, he 
wouldn't have had time to open 
it. His thin features were pale 
and he was snuffling with exertion. 

Reaching him, Nilsen jerked 
him around by One shoulder, 
smacked him in the jaw. There 
was plenty of force behind that 
blow. Aram, a small, lightly 
built man, caromed along the 
passage and ended up as an un


A LITTLE OIL 



145 



conscious bundle by the forward 
door. Rubbing his knuckles, Nilsen grunted to himself, checked 
the airlock wheel to make sure 
it was holding good and tight. 

Then he grasped 'the -victim's 
feet while Kinrade lifted the 
shoulders and between them they 
bore the sagging Aram to his tiny 
cabin, laid him in his bunk. Nilsen remained on watch while 
Kinrade went for the hypodermic 
needle and a shot of dope. They 
put Aram out of the running for 
the next twelve hours. This was 
the only known countermeasure : 
an enforced sleep during which 
an overactive brain could rest 
and strained nerves recuperate. 

Returning to the galley, Nilsen 
resumed his interrupted meal, 
said to Kinrade, "Good thing he 
didn't think to swipe a gun." 

Kinrade nodded without answering. He knew what the other 
meant. Weygarth had tried to 
hold them off with a gun .while 
he prepared his dash to false 
freedom on a blast of air. They 
could not rush him without risking serious loss. They'd had to 
shoot him down quickly, ruthlessly, before it was too late. 
Weygarth had been their first 
bitter casualty only twenty 
months out. 

And now they dared not suffer 
another loss. Five men could run 
the ship, control it, steer it, land 
it. Five represented the absolute 



minimum. Four would be damned forever to a great metal coffin 
thundering blindly amid the host 
of stars. 

It brought up yet another of 
the problems that Kinrade had 
not been able to resolve, at least 
to his own satisfaction. Should 
an airlock be fastened with a real 
lock to which only the captain 
held the key? Or might that cost 
them dear in a sudden and grave 
emergency? Which was the greater risk, lunatic escape for one or 
balked escape for all? •• 

Oh, well, they were homeward 
bound, and when they got back 
he'd hand over the log and the 
detailed reports and leave the 
big brains to work it out for 
themselves. That was their job; 
his to make landfall safely. 

KINRADE glanced at Nilsen, 
noted the introspective frown 
on his face and knew that he was 
thinking of Weygarth. Scientists 
and top-grade technicians are 
people with highly trained minds, 
but that does not make them less 
or more than other men. Their 
status does not keep them in 
splendid isolation from humanity. 
Outside of their especial interests, 
they are plain, ordinary folk subject to the strains and tensions of 
every man. Their minds are not 
and cannot be solely and .everlastingly occug/ed with one subject. Sbmetimfcs 5 they think of 



146 




 



other men and sometimes of 
themselves. Nilsen's was a trained mind, intelligent and sensitive, 
therefore so much the more liable 
to crack. Kinrade knew instinctively that if and when Nilsen 
made a break for the lock, he 
would not forget the gun. 

It took less intelligent, less 
imaginative types — the cow-mind 
—to endure long incarceration in 
a huge steel boiler oh which a 
dozen devils hammered hour after 
hour, day after day, without cease 
or let-up. There was another 
problem for Earth's bigbrains to 
mull a' while : dull-witted people 
were tops for endurance, but useless functionally. Bright minds 
were essential to run the ship, 
yet somewhat more likely to go 
phur, even though only temporarily. 

What did this add up^to? Answer: the ideal space crew should 
be composed of hopeless ^3opes 
with high I. Q. A contradiction 
in terms. 

Now that he came to consider 
it, the thought struck him that 
here might be the solution to the 
mystery of Bertelli. Those who 
had designed and built the ship 
and hand-picked the crew were 
people of formidable craftiness. 
It was incredible that they'd dig , 
up a gormless character like Bertelli in a spirit of not giving a 
damn. The selection had been 
deliberate and carefully calcu


lated, of that Kinrade was certain. Perhaps the loss of two ships 
had convinced them that they'd 
have to be more modest in theii 
choice of crews. Maybe Bertelli 
had been planted to test how a 
dope made out. 

If so, they had something — but 
it wasn't enough. Without a 
doubt, Bertelli would be the last 
to crack, the last to race for the 
airlock Beyond that, nothing 
could be said in his favor purely 
from the technical viewpoint. He 
knew little worth knowing and 
that he had learned from the 
others. Any responsibility with 
which he was entrusted invariably got bollixed in masterly 
style. Indeed, with his big, clumsy 
mitts on any of the controls, he 
would be a major menace. 

He was liked, all right. In fact, 
he was popular in a way. Bertelli had other accomplishments 
about as genuinely useful on a 
.spaceship as a skunk's smell-gun 
at a convention. He*- could play 
several musical instruments, sing 
in a cracked voice, mime in really funny manner, tap-dance with 
a peculiar sort of loose-jointed 
clumsiness. After they'd got over 
their initial irritation with him, 
they had found him amusing and 
pathetic — a bumbler they were 
sorry to feel superior to, because 
they couldn't think of anyont 
who wouldn't be superior to him. 

The schemers back home

would learn that a spaceship is 
better without non-technical 
thickheads, Kinrade decided 
rather uncertainly. They had 
made their test and it hadn't 
come off. It hadn't come off. It 
hadn't come off. The "mofe he repeated it to himself, the less sure 
he felt about it. 

Vail came in, paused at the 
sight of them. "I thought you'd 
finished ten minutes ago." 

"It's all right." Nilsen stood up, 
brushed away crumbs, gestured 
toward his chair. "I'll go watch 
the engines." 

Getting his tray and meal, Vail 
seated himself, eyed the others. 
"What's up?" 

"Aram's in bed with Charlie," 
Kinrade told him. 

Not the nicker of emotion 
crossed Vail's face. He made a 
vicious stab at his food, said, 
"The Sun would bring him out of 
that condition. That's what we 
all want, a sight of the Sun." 

"There are millions of suns," 
informed Bertelli, tagerty offering 
the lot. 

Leaning his elbows on the 
table, Vail said in a harsh voice 
and with great significance, "That 
is precisely the point!" 

Bertelli's eyes dulled into complete confusion. He fidgeted with 
his tray, knocked his fork around 
without noticing it. Still looking 
at Vail, he felt for the fork, picked it up by the prongs, absently 



poked at the tray with the handle. 
Then he lifted the handle toward 
his mouth. 

"I'd try the other end," advised 
Vail, watching with interest. "It's 
sharper." 

The eyes lowered, studied the 
fork while gradually they took 
on an expression of vacant surprise. He made a childish motion 
indicative of helplessness. Finally 
he bestowed on both his usuai 
apologetic grin and at the same 
time gave a casual twitch of 
finger and thumb that landed the 
handle smack in his palm. 

Kinrade noticed that flip. Vail 
didn't, but he did — and for once 
he got a strange, uncanny feeling 
that Bertelli had made a very 
small mistake, a tiny «rror that 
might have passed unseen. 

WHEN Kinrade was in his 
cabi», the intercom called 
on the desk and Marsden's voice 
said, "Aram's just come out of it. 
He's got a sore jaw, but he seems 
cooled down. I don't think he 
needs another shot — yet." 

"We'll let him run loose, but 
keep an eye on him for a while," 
Kinrade decided. "Tell Bertelli 
to stick close. He has nothing 
better to do." 

"All right." Marsden paused, 
added in lower tones, "Vail is 
pretty surly lately. Have you 
noticed?" 

"He's okay. Just gets jumpy 



148 




 



now and again. Don't we all?" 

"I suppose so." Marsden 
sounded as if he'd like to say 
more, but he didn't. He cut off 
and the intercom went silent. 

Finishing the day's entry on 
the log, Kinrade examined himself at the mirror, decided he'd 
put off a shave a little longer. 
This was his idea of petty luxury; he disliked the chore, but 
lacked the courage to grow a 
beard. Other men, other notions. 

He lay back in his chair and 
enjoyed a quiet think, first about 
the planet called home, then the 
men who had sent this ship into 
space, then the men who were 
flying it with him. They'd been 
trained for the job, these six who, 
for the first time, had reached 
another, star, and their training 
had incorporated a certain 
amount of useful flexibility. The 
three spacemen among them had 
been given superswift education 
in some branch of science. The 
scientists had undergone courses 
in space navigation or atomic engineering. Two aptitudes per 
man. Then he thought again and 
eliminated Bertelh. 

Pre-flight education had gone 
further than that. A baldheaded 
old coot who bossed a lunatic 
asylum had lectured them on 
space etiquette with every air of 
knowing what he was talking 
about. Each man, he had explained, would know only three things 



about his fellows, to wit: name, 
age and qualification. No man 
must ask for more nor seek to 
pry into another's private life. 
Unknown lives provide no basis 
for irrational prejudices, antagonisms or insults, he had said. 
Empty personalities don't clash 
so readily. So it was established 
that none might urge another to 
reveal what made him tick. 

Thus Kinrade could not probe 
the reasons why Vail was irritable above the average or what 
made Marsden more impatient 
than others. He could not determine from past data why Nilsen 
potentially was the most dangerous or Aram the least stable. 
Neither could he insist that Bertelli explain his presence in understandable terms. Pending successful completion of the flight, each 
man's history remained hidden 
behind a curtain through which, 
from time to time only insignificant items had been glimpsed. 

After most of four years existing cheek by jowl with these 
people, he had * come to know 
them as never before — but not 
as he would know them some 
day in the green fields of Earth 
when the flight was a bygone 
event, the tabu was broken and 
they had memories for free discussion. 

He liked to muse on these 
matters because he had developed a theory that he intended

"Sol is the nearest star." 

"It is if we're heading right," 
Nilsen retorted. 

Sliding open a drawer in his 
desk, Kinrade took out a large 
roll of paper, spread it across the 
top. Its multitude of tiny squares 
bore a large number of dots and 
crosses amid which a thick, black 
line ran in a steady curve. 

"This is the return course." 
His fingers indicated several 
crosses and dots. "We can tell 
by direct observation of these 
bodies whether or not we are on 
course. There's only one thing we 
can't check with absolute accuracy." 

"What's that?" inquired Vail, 
frowning at the chart. 

"Our velocity. It can be estimated only with a five per cent 
margin of error, plus or minus. 
I know we're on course, but not 
precisely how far along it. Hence 
the four-day lag. I warn you that 
it can extend to as much as ten." 

Nilsen said, heavily, "They 
took photos of the star formation on the way out. We've just 
been putting the transparencies 
over the screen. They don't 
match." 

"Of course they don't." Kinrade displayed impatience. 
"We're not at the same point. 
The star field will have circumferential displacement." 

"We aren't without brains despite not being trained naviga

tors," Nilsen gave back. "There 
is displacement. It progresses 
radially from a focal point that 
is not the pink spot you claim is 
Sol. The point is about halfway 
between that and the left edge of 
the screen." He gave, a loud sniff, 
invited, "Can you talk yourself 
out of that one?" 

Kinrade sighed, put a finger on 
the chart. "This line is a curve, 
as you can see. The outward 
course was a similar curve bending the reverse way. The tail 
camera focused along the line 
of the ship's axis. A few thousand miles out, it was pointing 
sunward, but the farther the ship 
got, the more its axis pointed to 
one side. By the time we crossed 
the orbit of Pluto, it was aiming 
to hell and away." 

Peering at the chart, Nilsen 
thought a while, asked shrewdly, 
"If you are sincere, what's the 
absolute margin of error?" 

"I told you — ten days." 

"Nearly half of those have 
gone. We'll give you the other 
half." 

"Thanks!" said Kinrade, faint' 
ly sarcastic. 

"After which we'll either see 
Sol and identify it beyond doubt 
or we'll have a new captain and 
be heading for the nearest light." 

"We'll draw lots for captain,*' 
suggested Bertelli from the back. 
"I'd like the chance to boss a 
ship." 

1S\ 



"Heaven help us!" exclaimed 
Marsden. 

"We'll pick the man best qualified," said Nilsen. 

"That's why ypu chose Kinrade" in the first placer Bertelli 
reminded him. 

"Maybe. But we'll find someone else." 

"Then I insist on being considered. One dope is as good as 
another for making a mess of 
things." 

"When it comes to that, we're 
not in the same class," replied 
Nilsen, feeling that his efforts 
were being subtly sabotaged. 
"You can out -boob me with your 
big hands pinned to your big 
ears." He looked over the others. 
"Isn't that so?" 

They grinned assent. 

It wasn't Nilsen's triumph. It 
was somebody else's. 

Merely because they did grin. 

BERTELLI organized another 
party that night. For once his 
birthday was not the pretext. 
Somehow he'd managed to celebrate seven birthdays in four 
years without anyone seeing fit to 
count them all. But an excuse 
can be overdone, so he announced 
his candidacy for the post of 
captain, explaining that he wished 
to curry favor with voters. It was 
as good as any. 

They cleared the galley as 
they'd .done a score of times be


fore. They broke a bottle of gin, 
shared it between them, sipped with introspective gtumness. 
Aram did his party-piece by birdcalling between two fingers, received the usual polite applause. 
Marsden recited something about 
the brown eye of the little yellow 
dog. By that time Nilsen had 
warmed up sufficiently to sing 
two songs in a deep, rich bass. 
He gained louder applause for 
having varied his~repertoire. 

Weygarth, of course, wasn't 
there to do his sleight-of-hand 
tricks. Sanderson and Dawkins 
were also missing from the bill. 
Temporarily, their absence was 
forgotten as the tiny audience 
awaited the star turn. 

Bertelli, of course. This was th. 
sort of thing at which he excelled and the chief reason why 
a major nuisance had become 
tolerated, liked, perhaps loved. 

When they'd held the alien 
landfall spree, he'd played an 
oboe for most of an hour, doing 
more things with the instrument 
than they had believed possible. 
He had ended with a sonic impression of an automobile collision, the agitated toot of horns, 
the crash, the heated argument 
between oboe-voiced drivers tha> 
finished with decidedly rud 
noises. Nilsen had almost rolle i 
out of his seat.

ranged for no reason other than 
the hell of it. Bertelli had mimed 
for those, his dental plates removed, his features rubbery, his 
arms like snakes. First the eager 
sailor leaping ashore and seeking 
a chance to play his own strumpet. The search for talent, the discovery, pursuit, encounter, rebuff, 
the persuasion, the going to a 
show, the strolling home, the pass 
on the doorstep rewarded with a 
blackeye. 

Another time he'd reversed the 
role, become a plump blonde followed by a hungry sailor. Wordlessly, but with motions, gestures, 
posturings and facial expressions 
equal to if not better than speech, 
he had taken them on the night's 
prowl ending with the fight on 
the doorstep. 

This time he pretended to be a 
bashful sculptor shaping a statue 
of Venus de Milo with invisible 
clay. Piling up a column of what 
wasn't there, he hesitantly stroked it, nervously patted it, embarrassedly smoothed it into 
near-visible form. He rolled two 
cannon-balls, plonked them on 
her chest while covering his eyes, 
rolled two pills and shyly put 
them on top, delicately molded 
them into shape, glanced fright enedly around, then bestowed a 
hurried kiss on his own handiwork. 

It took him twenty hilarious 
minutes to make her almost, but 



not quite, complete, at which 
point he took idiotic alarm. He 
scanned the horizon, looked out 
the door, peered under the table 
,to insure that they two were 
alone. Satisfied yet full of embarrassment, he made a faltering 
approach, withdrew, plucked up 
fresh courage, lost it again, had 
a spasm of daring that failed at 
the critical moment. 

Vail offered pungent advice 
while Nilsen sprawled in the next 
seat and held art aching diaphragm. Summoning up everything he had in an effort to finish 
the job, Bertelli made a mad rush 
at it, fell over his own feet, slid 
on his face along the steel floorplates. Nilsen made choking 
sounds. Stupidly enraged with 
himself, Bertelli shot to his feet, 
drew his bottom lip over the tip 
of his nose, waggled his bat-ears, 
closed his eyes, made one violent 
stab with a forefinger — and provided Venus with a navel. 

For days afterward, they 
chuckled over that performance, 
making curvaceous motions with 
their hands or prodding each 
other in the paunch at odd moments. The ghostly Venus stayed 
good for a laugh until , . . the 
Sun came up. 

T1/|AKING another of his frequent checks late in the 
eighth day, Marsden found that

ineided dot for dot with focal 
point two inches leftward of an 
enlarged pink glow. He let go 
a howl that brought the rest of 
the crew racing to the bow. 

Sol was identified. They looked 
at it, licked lips over it, looked 
again. Four years in a bottle is 
like forty years in the star fields 
— and they had been bottled too 
long. One by one they visited 
Kinrade's cabin and exulted over 
the superstition on the wall.

came feebly through the radio

day by day, week by week, until 
finally it bawled from the speaker 
while the fore observation-por^,

"From where I'm standing, I

how much — "

shakes, speeches, the posing for 
press photographers, newsreels, 
television scanners, the cameras 
of countless frantic amateurs. 

It ended at last. Kinrade said 
farewell to his crew? felt the beartrap grip of Nilsen's hand, the 
soft, frank clasp of Aram, the shy, 
self-conscious touch of Bertelli. 

Looking into the latter's 
mournful eyes, he said, "The authorities will now start howling 
for all the data we've got. I 
suppose you've finished your 
book." 

"What book?" 

"Now, now, don't kid me." 
He offered a knowing wink. 
"You're the official psychologist, 
aren't you?" 

He didn't wait for an answer. 
While the others busied themselves collecting personal belongings, he got the log and the file 
pf reports, took them to the Administration Building. 

LOOKING no different for the 
passage of time, Bancroft sat 
paunchily behind his desk, said 
with satirical satisfaction, "You 
are now looking at a fat man wallowing in the joys of promotion 
and higher salary." 

"Congratulations.** Kinrade 
dumped the books and sat down, 
*T would swap both for youth 
and adventure." Casting an anticipatory glance at what the 
Other had brought, Bancroft went 



on, "There are questions I'm 
bursting to ask. But the answers 
are hidden somewhere in that pile 
and I guess you're in a hurry to 
go home." 

"A 'copter will pick me up 
when it can get through the overcrowded air. I have twenty minutes to spare." 

"In that case I'll use them." 
Bancroft leaned forward, eyes intent. "What about the first two 
ships?" 

"We searched seven planets 
Not a sign." 

"They hadn't landed or crashed?" 

"No." 

"So they must have gone on?"* 

"Evidently." 

"Any idea why?** 

Kinrade hesitated, said, "It's s 
hunch and nothing more. I think 
their numbers were reduced by, 
accident, sickness or whatever. 
They became too few to retain 
control of the ship." He paused, 
added, "We lost three men ourselves." 

"Tough luck." Bancroft looked 
unhappy. "Who were they?" 

"Weygarth, Dawkins and Sanderson. The first died on the way 
out. He never saw the new sun, 
much less his own. The story is 
there." He gestured toward the 
reports. "The other two were 
killed on the fourth planet, which 
I've established as unsafe for human habitation.'* "What's wrong with it?" 

"A big and hungry life-form 
exists under the surface, sitting 
with traps held open beneath a 
six-inch crust of soil. Sanderson 
walked around, fell 'into a red, 
sloppy mouth four feet wide by 
ten long. He was gulped from 
sight. Dawkins rushed to his rescue, but dropped into another." 
His fingers fumbled with each 
other as he finished, "There was 
nothing we could do, not a 
damned thing." 

"A pity, a great pity." Bancroft 
shook his head slowly from side 
to side. "How about the other 
planets?" 

"Four are useless. Two are 
made to measure for us." 

"Hah, that's something!" He 
glanced at the small clock on his 
desk, continued hurriedly, "And 
now the ship. Doubtless your reports are full of criticisms. Nothing is perfect, not even the best 
we've produced. What do you 
consider its most outstanding 
fault?" 

"The noise. It could drive you 
out of your mind. It needs cutting 
out." 

"Not completely," Bancroft 
contradicted. "There is psychic 
terror in absolute silence." 

"All right. Then it needs cutting down to more endurable 
level. Try it yourself for a week 
and see how you like it." 

"I wouldn't. The problem is 



being beaten, although slowly. 
We have a new and quieter typ« 
of engine already on the testbench. Four years' progress, you 
know." 

"We need it," said Kinrade, 

BANCROFT went on, "And 
what do you think of the 

crew?" 

"Best ever." 

"They ought to be. We skimmed the world for the cream — 
nothing less was good enough, 
Each man was tops in his own 
particular line." 

"Including Bertelli?" 

"I knew you'd ask about him.'* 
Bancroft smiled as if at a secret 
thought. "You want me to explain him, eh?" 

"I've no right to insist, but I'd 
certainly like to know why you 
included such a dead weight." 

"We lost two ships," said 
Bancroft, looking serious. "One 
could be an accident. Two were 
not. It's hard to believe that an 
exceptional kind of breakdown 
or a collision with a lump of rock 
or some other million-to-one 
chance would occur twice running." 

"I don't believe it myself." 

"We spent years studying the 
problem," Bancroft continued. 
"Every time we got the same 
answer: it wasn't due to any 
defect in the vessels. The cause 
lay somewhere in the human ele

ment. Short of a four-year test 
on living men, we could do no 
more than speculate. Then one 
day the likely solution popped 
up by sheer chance." 
'•How?" 

"We were in this very room, 
beating our brains for the hundredth or two-hundredth time, 
when that clock stopped." He indicated the timepiece facing him. 
"A fellow named Whittaker from 
the Space Medicine Research Station wound it up, shook it, got it 
going. Immediately afterward a 
brainwave hit him, kerplonk!" 

Picking up the clock, Bancroft 
opened its back, turned it toward his listener. 

"What do you see?" 

"Cogs and wheels." 

"Nothing else?" 

"Couple of coiled springs." 

"Are you sure that is all?" 

"All that matters," declared 
Kinrade, having no doubt. 

"Wrong, dead wrong," said 
Bancroft, positively, "You have 
made precisely the mistake we 
made with ships number one arid 
two. We built giant metal clocks, 
fitted them with human cogs and 
wheels accurately designed for 
their purpose. Cogs and wheels 
of flesh and blood, chosen with 
.the same care as one would 
choose parts for a, fine watch. 
But the clocks stopped. We had 
overlooked something that Whittaker suddenly thought of." 



"Well, what was it?" 

Bancroft smiled and said, "A 
little oil." 

"Oil?" exclaimed Kinrade, sitting up. 

"Our error was natural. In a 
technological age, we technicians 
tend to think we're the whole 
cheese. We aren't. Maybe we're 
a very considerable slice, but we 
are not the lot. Civilization is 
composed of others also, the 
housewife, the taxi driver, the 
dime store salesgirl, the postman, 
the hospital nurse, the corner cop. 
It would be a hell of a civilization 
built solely on boys pushing studs 
of computor-machines and without the butcher, the baker, the 
candlestick-maker. That's a lesson some of us needed to learn." 

"You've got something," Kinrade agreed, "but I don't know 
what." 

"We had another problem in 
our laps," said Bancroft. "What 
sort of oil must you use for 
human cogs and wheels? Answer: 
human oil. What kind of individual specializes in being oil?" 

"And you dug up Bertelli?" 

"We did. His family has been 
oil for twenty generations. He is 
the present holder of a great 
tradition — and internationally 
famous." 

"Never heard of him. I suppose 
he traveled with us under a false 
name?" 

"He went under his own." 



A LITTLE OIL 



"I didn't recognize him," Kinrade persisted. "Neither did anyone else. So how can he be 
famous? Or did he have his face 
altered by plastic surgery?" 

"He changed it completely ki 
One minute fiat." Getting up, 
Bancroft lumbered to a filing 
cabinet, opened it, sought through 
several folders. Extracting a fullplate glossy photography, he slid 
it across the desk. "All he did to 
his face was wash it." 

Picking up the picture, Kinrade 
stared at the chalk-white features, 
the cone-shaped hat set rakishly 
On a high, false skull, the huge 
eyebrows arched in perpetual surprise, the red diamonds painted 
around the mournful eyes, the 
grotesque, bulbous nose, the crimson ear-to-ear mouth, the thick 
ruff of lace around the neck. 

"Coco!" 

"The twentieth Coco with 
which this world has been blessed," Bancroft confirmed. 

Kinrade had another long look. 
"May I keep this?" 

"Certainly. I can get a thousand more copies any time I 
* want." 

T7"INRADE emerged from the 
Administration Building just 
in time to see the subject of his 
thoughts in hot pursuit of a 
ground-taxi. 

With a shapeless and hurriedly 
packed bag swinging wildly from 



one hand, Bertelli went along in 
exaggerated, loose.-jointed bounds 
with big boots rising waist-high, 
while his long neck protruded 
forward and his face bore a 
ludicrous expression of woe. 

Many a time the onlooker had 
been puzzled by the fleeting 
familiarity of one of Bertelli's 
poses or gestures. Now, knowing 
what he did know, he recognized 
instantly the circus jester's classic 
anxiety -gallop across a sawdust 
ring. To make it complete, Bertelli should have been casting 
frightened glances over one shoulder at a floating skeleton attached 
to him by a long cord. 

Bertelli caught up with the taxi, 
bestowed an inane smile, slung 
his bag inside and clambered after 
it. The taxi whirled away with 
twin spurts of vapor from its 
underbody jets. 

For a long minute, Kinrade 
stood looking absently at the 
poised spaceships and the sky. 
His mind was viewing the world 
as a gigantic stage on which every 
man, woman and child played a 
wonderful and necessary part. 

And holding the whole show together with laughter, exaggerating temper and hostility and con-< 
flict into absurdity, was the clown. 

If he'd had to assemble the 
crew, he couldn't have picked 
a better psychologist than Bertelli.
