Game for Blondes By JOHN D MacDONALD 

MARTIN GREYNOR was 
very very drunk, not 
gayly drunk, not freshly 
six-quick-ones drunk, but drunk 
in varying degrees since December tenth at ten P.M. Two big 
red 10s in his mind? always with 
him — zeroes like a pair of headlights. Ruth beside him, sweetscented, fur-clad. And one of his 
fits of stupid, vicious, reckless 
anger. December 10. 10 P.M. 
Hitting the slick black curves 
hard, motor droning, forcing her 
to tell him he was going too fast. 
Once she said it, he could slow 
down and that would be a little 
victory. 

"Too fast, Marty!" she said. 
They were the last words she 
ever spoke. 

Fat headlights and the long 
whining skid, and the crash, and 
the jangle that went on forever. 
Ripped fur and blood and gone 
the sweet scent. 

Now it was New Year's Eve. 
Ruth was gone. His job was gone,

the car gone. Money was left, 
though, money a-plenty. Funny 
about drinking. The wobbling, 
falling down, sick stage lasts 
about twelve days, he. discovered. 
Important discovery. Boon to 
science. Then you're armorplated. Liquor drops into a pit, 
clunk. Walk steady, talk steady. 
Put in come the illusions on little 
soft pink feet. 

Ruth ahead of you, hurrying 
down a dark street. "Ruth! 
Wait!" 

Hurriedly she puts on a wattled mask, turns and grimaces at 
you, rasps in a mocking ginhusky voice. "Ya wan' something, 
sweetie?" 

SHE has slipped around the 
next corner. Run, now, and 
see her in the next block. Cake 
the wet December slush on the 
shrinking, stiffening leather of 
the shoes that came out of that, 
store window. 

"Marty, let's buy you a pair 
of those. I like those shoes." . 

Suit she liked. Now a bit dribbled, a shade rancid. Apartment 
the way they had left it that 
night. Never gone back. Beds not 
made, no doubt. 

Walk through the night streets, 
looking for punishment. Looking 
for a way to release the load of 
guilt. Now the old places dont 
want you. "Sorry, Mr. Greynor. 
you've begun to stink." The lit


tle bars don't care. 

"HAP-PEEE NEW YEAR!" 
The bar mirrors are enchanted. 
Ruth stands behind you. She 
said, "Never run away from me, 
darling. You'd be too easy to 
find. Wanted — a red-headed man 
with one blue eye and one brown 
eye. See? You couldn't get away 
with it." 

The face that looks tiack has 
been gaunted, because you stopped eating. 

He bent low over- the bar until 
his lips almost touched the shot 
glass, then lifted it in a hard arc, 
tossing his head back. It burned 
«ts way down into the nothingness. The bartender slapped the 
change down. M.artin Greynor 
fumbled with it, pushed a quarter over to the far edge. The bartender slipped it off the bar with 
a surly grunt' and clinked it into 
a glass on the back bar. 

Martin turned around and saw 
the three girls again. He wondered if it was, again, or if he was 
seeing them for the first time. 
The mind performs such odd little hop, skip, jumps. He debated 
it solemnly, got nowhere. 

They were at a table. They 
were all looking at him with an 
air of watchfulness. That could 
be imagined, too. Three lovelies 
like that are not going to make 
the weary, ginmill rounds with 
you and keep watching you. You 
ain't that purty, Martin.

When in doubt, you write it 
down on top of your mind and 
underline it very firmly and hope 
that when the situation occurs 
again, you can find the place 
where you wrote it down. 

He walked out steadily and 
stood on the sidewalk. He had the 
strong impression that Ruth was 
stretched flat on the roof,, her 
head over the edge of the building, grinning down at him. He 
turned sharply and looked up. 
The Moon hung misty over Manhattan, debauched by neon. 

TVEXT block. Don't turn right. 

' That will take you toward 
midtown, toward the higher 
prices, toward the places where 
they let you get three steps inside the door, then turn you firmly and walk you back out. Stay 
over here, buster. 

They'd rolled him a few times 
that first week. Made a nuisance 
to go to the bank and get more 
"cash each time. Now they'd stopped bothering. One of the times 
they'd left him sitting, spitting 
out a tooth. His tongue kept finding the hole. 

Neon in the middle of the next 
block. Two couples sitting on the 
curb. 

"Down by-ee the old mill 
streeeeeeem ..." 

Spotted by the prowl car. 

"Break it up! Move along 
there!" 



TIE looked back. Three female 
silhouettes, arm in arm, step 
in step, tick-tock-tick of the pretty stilt heels avoiding the gray 
smears of slush. 

He ducked into the door under 
the neon. This was a dark one. 
Dancing was going on back there 
somewhere to the cat-fence yowl 
of a clarinet and pulse-thump of 
piano. He edged in at the bar. 
The bartender came over fast, 
with that trouble-look on his face. 
Martin shoved the five out fast. 
"Rye straight," he said. 
The bartender paused for a 
count of three, then turned back 
to the rye department. 

Martin looked over and saw 
them come in. He hunted on top 
of his mind and found the heavily underlined place. He read it 
off. Three blondes. Three arrogant, damp-mouthed, hot-eyed, 
overdressed blondes — sugary in 
the gloom. Same ones. 
• It brought him up out of himself, hand clutching the rim of 
his soul, for a quick look over 
the edge. One lone blonde in this 
place would have pivoted heads 
in tennis-match style. Two would 
bring hot arid heart-felt exhalations. Three, he saw, seemed to 
stun the joint. It put a crimp in 
the rumble of bar- talk. It ran 
furry fingers down male spines. 

They were watching him. He 
stared back until he was certain. 
Okay. Fact confirmed. Three 



GAME FOR BLONDES

blondes following him from joint 
to joint. Watching him. Next 
step — watch real close, see if anybody walks through them. 

They got a table along the wall. 
He watched. A hefty young man 
strutted over to their table, hiking up his pants, making with the 
bold smile. He bent over the 
table. They all gave him cold 
looks. One shook her shining 
head. He persisted. 

The young man turned fast 
and hard and went high and rigid 
into the air. Martin saw him go 
up in that jet-leap of spasmed 
muscles, head thrown back, agony-masked face. He fell like 
something pushed out of a window. People gathered around 
him. They blocked Martin's 
view. 

He* looked at the blondes. They 
were watching him. In an empty 
lot in the back of his mind, a 
rabbit bounded for cover, where 
there was no cover, and the dogs, 
sat watching, tongues lolling. 
Cold started at a spot at the base 
of his spine. It crept nuzzling 
into his armpits. 

He drank and scooped up his 
change and left. 

He ran to the corner and stood, 
and the trembling went away. 
The ^slush was beginning to 
freeze. It crunched a bit under 
his shoes. That was another 
tiling. You didn't have to eat, 
and you didn't get cold. Ergo, 



one should be beyond fear. Go 
around being afraid of blondes 
and people will begin to point at 
you. 

He snickered. The sound was 
as rigid as the rind of freeze atop 
the sidewalk slush. We have 
nothing to fear but fear itself. 

Problem for the class : You got a guy, see. He's dying of cancer 
or something, see. He's in agony 
and somebody comes into his 
room and stands by his bed and 
lifts a big club to hammer him 
one. Is the guy afraid? If so, 
why? If he is, it means that fear 
is something divorced from an 
objective and intellectual appraisal of the total situation. It 
means fear is spawned in the guts, 
down there where the animal 
lives, down where the rabbit 
blood is. 

APIECE of paper scuttered 
around the corner and embraced his leg. He bent over, pick ed it loose and sent it on its way, 
"Hell of a big hurry, aren't 
you?" he said. 

Tick, tack, tick, tack. By God , 
perfect marching. ~Ex-WACs? AH 
blonde and all coming along. S 
what can blondes do to you? He 
stood his ground for a slow count 
of ten. 

Tick, tack. 

Fear rocketed into his throat 
and burst out his ears and he ran 
like hell.

cruiser nailed him in the 
spotlight/ tracking him like 



a floorshow, making him feel as 
though he were running, running, 
running in one spot. He stopped 
and leaned against a building, 
panting. The spot still held him. 
It nailed his eyes to the wall behind him. Big shoulders blocked 
it. Creak of leather and brass 
gleam. 

"What you running for, chief?" 
"It's ... a cold night. Keeping 
warm." 

The cuff, slid him along the 
wall and the hand on his rancid 
suit yanked him back upright. 
"What you running for, I said?" 

"Those three blondes coming. 
They're after me." He could hear 
them coming. The spot went 
away. He was blind. But he, 
could hear them. 

"After you, you creep?" 

"Yes, I . . ." 

"Johnny, we better dump the 
chief here off at the ward. Come 
on, Mr. Irresistable." 

Tick, tack, tock, tick. Silence. 

"What do you girls want?" 

Brass buttons took a high, 
hard, stiff -legged, stiff -armed 
leap. Martin fell into slush and 
rolled. Inside the cruiser, the 
driver stiffened, his head going 
bong on the metal roof. 

T|/|ARTIN ran, bleating. An 
empty field and no cover. 
The wise eyes of the hunting 



dogs. Wait until he comes around 
again, fellows. 

He turned, skidding in the 
freezing slush, and ran int. an 
alley, tangling his legs in a bunch 
of trash, sprawling, clawing his 
way up again, running into a 
wall, stinging his hands. He turned. Three female silhouettes in 
the alley mouth. High-wa.Ved, 
long-legged, stilt-heeled, creamheaded. 

He made little pounds in his 
throat and pawed his way along 
the wall. An alley like a shoe box 
with one end missing — the end 
they were at. 

He sat down and covered his 
eyes. Count to ten and they'll go 
away. One-a-larry, two-a-larry, 
three-a-larry, four. 

New spotlight. This was a diferent one. It came at him from a 
lot of little directions, like one of 
those trick showers with a dozen 
spray heads. 

"Got um," a blonde voice said. 

"Up to spec, no?" 

They stood outside the radiance. 

"Color and out," one said. 
"Take um." 

Something grew in front of 
him, a red happy-new-year balloon. So it was a gag, maybe. It 
lobbed through the air toward 
him, turning in iridescence. He 
caught it. It was red jelly with a 
cellophane skin. It kept trying to 
slide down between his fingers. 



GAME FOR BLONDES

"Yah-hah!" one of the blondes 
said. 

It broke in his hands, showered 
green needles up to his nose to 
sizzle in his brain fat. 

The sky broke in half and he 
went over backward and down, 
heels up and over, sizzling. 

MARTIN slid naked across a 
mirrored floor. H« was bugsized and it was the mirror on 
his mother's dressing table a million years ago. He stopped sliding and tried to sit up. The 
bracing hand skidded and he hit 
his head. 

He tried more cautiously. He 
could sit up by carefully shifting 
his weight, but he couldn't stand. 
The surface was frictionless. 
Compared to it, glare ice was like 
sandpaper. 

He lay down* and looked up. 
Overhead was nothing. He 
thought about that for quite a 
while. Nothing. No thing. Nothing with a flaw in it. A little 
flaw. He peered at it. It was in 
the shape of a tiny naked man. 
He moved a leg. The tiny naked 
man moved a leg. Everything 
clicked into focus. A mirror 
under him and, at an incredible 
height above him, another. 

Now, he thought, I'm a germ 
on a big microscope. His body 
felt odd. He managed to sit up 
again. He looked at himself. 
Clean. Impossibly, incredibly 



clean. His fingernails were snowy. 
His toenails were like white paper. His skin was clean and pink 
with a glow of health, but the old 
heart went thudding slowly and 
sickly along. 

Silence. All he could hear was 
the roar of his blood in his ears. 
Like listening to a sea shell. 
There had been a big pink conch 
in his grandfather's house. 

"Hear the sea, Marty?" 

The mirror tilted and he slid 
into a hole that wasn't there before. He came out into a square 
blue room. 

His three blondes were there, 
watching him. We don't get pink 
elephants. We don't get snakes 
and bugs. We get blondes. 

He stood up, too aware of his 
nudity. They watched him calmly, ignoring it. 

"Now, look," he said, "can't 
we be friends?" 

They had changed. Their 
mouths were different — vivid 
green paint in a perfect rectangle. 
They looked at him with that 
calm pride of ownership. Nice 
doggy. 

"Now, look," Re began again, 
and stopped when he noticed 
their strange dresses. He looked 
closer. Ladies, please, you can't 
dress with a paint spray. But 
they had. 

"This," he said, "is a nightmare by Petty, out of Varga " 

The paint job was nicely 



130 




 



shaded at the edges, but just "a 
paint job. One of them stepped 
to him, grabbed him by the hair 
and tilted his head back. She 
looked into his eyes and made a 
little satisfied clucking sound. 
She turned and pointed to the 
corner. 

"Yup now," she said. 

"How does one go about yupping?" he asked vacantly. « 

She looked at one of the other 
blondes, who said slowly and 
precisely, "Hurry — up — now. 
late." 

There was a pile of clothes in 
the corner.^ He went over, glad 
for a chance of regaining pants, 
even in a dream world. The 
garments were recognizable, the 
material wasn't. A sartorial cartoon of the American male, 
mid-twentieth century. Every incongruity of the clothing exaggerated. Sleeve buttons like saucers. 
Shoulders padded out a foot on 
each side. No buttons, no snaps, 
no zippers. You just got inside 
them and they were on, somehow. * 
The buttons on the suit were 
fakes. The suit was bright blue 
with a harsh red stripe. 

Dressed, he felt like a straight 
man in a burlesque. 

From a distance he heard a 
great shout. It sounded like 
"Yah-hah!" from ten thousand 
throats. He suddenly had the 
strong hunch that he was going 
On display. 

GAME FOR BLONDES 



The nearest blonde- confirmed 
that hunch. She stepped over and 
clamped a metal circlet around 
his forehead. 

Three golden chains dangled 
from his headpiece. Each blonde 
took one chain. The nearest one 
to one of the blue walls touched 
it. A slit appeared and folded 
back. They went through. The 
blondes began to strut. A midway strut. A stripper stomp. 

"Here comes Martin," he said 
feebly. 

TTE was in the middle of a garden. The clipped turf underfoot was springy. Tailored 
terraces rose on three sides. A fat 
sun and a billion flowers and 
several thousand exceptionally 
handsome people wearing paint 
jobs and nothing else. 

The center arena had some 
people in it, people fastened to 
chains as he was, each one held 
by three blondes. The spectators 
were all on the terraces. There 
was a picnic atmosphere. 

They went into the middle of 
the arena. The other captives 
were being fcd in an endless 
circle. 

"Yah-hah!" the multitude 
yelled. "Yah-hah-hah!" 

They posed in the center and 
then began the circling. Martin 
stared at his fellow captives. 
Some were men and some were 
women. One wore animal skins; 

131 



another wore armor. One was 
dressed like the pictures of George 
Washington. Some wore clothing 
he'd never seen before. 

He was led .around and around. 
More performers took "their center ring bow. Something was 
bothering him, some silly small 
thing. He couldn't fit his mind 
over it. Too much was going on 
in this delirium. 

Then he got it — all the captives 
had red hair. 

He turned and looked at the 
scared woman who walked behind him. She had red hair, one 
blue eye and one brown eye. She 
wore gingham and a sunbonnet. 

He sneaked looks at the 
others. One blue eye. One brown 
eye. Red hair. 

Everyone stopped walking. 
There was a great and final, 
"Yah-hah." Three sets of blondes 
stood in the center ring without 
captives. Their heads were bowed. 

His blondes trotted him over, 
took off the circlet and flipped 
him back into the blue room. 
The slit was closed. He pinched 
his leg. . 

"Hell," he said softly. 

The slit opened after what he 
imagined to be an hour had 
passed. One of his blondes came 
back. She had a man with her, a 
chesty citizen dressed in cerise 
paint. 

"Talkit ya tempo," she said, 
pointing at the chesty man.

He beamed at Martin. "Blessings," he said. 

"Blessings yourself." 

"Indebted. Thanking very 
much." 

"Your welcoming very much, 
bud." ; 

"Knowing all?" the man asked 
with a wide arm sweep. 

"Knowing nothing. Not a 
damnfd thing! What's this all 
about?" 

The chesty man beamed some 
more. He scratched his paint job 
lightly. He frowned. "Hard to 
say. You past. I future. Is party. 
My party. My house. My garden. Having game. Sending ladies 
your tempo, lot of tempos. All 
same thing. Bringing only with 
red on hair, eye brown, eye blue." 
Hard to find. For game." 

Martin goggled at him. "You 
mean a scavenger hunt through 
time?" 

"Not knowing. Is only game. 
Some ladies failing. Too bad." 

"What happens to them?" 

The man grinned. "No present 
for them. Now, present for you. 
Returning. Any place in tempo 
yours. To place taken. To other 
place. Sooner, later. Your 
choice." 

"Return me to any . . . moment 
in my life?" 

"All tempo function. You say 
► — how? — resonance." 

"Send me to December 10th, 
eight P.M." , 



MARTIN GREYNOR was sit 
ting on the edge of his bed. 
He had just yanked his shoelaces 
tight in the left shoe. The tipped 
laces were still in his hands. He 
let go of them. He heard a shower pouring. The sound stopped 
suddenly. 

His throat was full of rusty 
wire. "Ruth?" 

She opened the bathroom dooi. 
She was wrapped in a big yellow 
towel. 

"What is it now, Marty? My 
goodness, you've been needling 
me all evening. You're in a perfectly foul humor. I'm hurrying 
just as fast as I can." 

"Ruth, I . . ." He tried to 
smile. His lips felt split. 

She came to him, quick with 
concern. "Marty! Are you all 
right, darling? You look so odd.'' 

"Me? I've never been more all 
right." He pulled her down beside him. 

"Hey, you! I'm soaking wet." 

"Baby, do we have to drive 
way out there tonight? Do we?" 

She stared at him. "Good Lord, 
it was your idea. I detest both of 
them.' You know that." 

"Let's stay home. Just the two 
of us. Bust open that brandy, 
maybe. Use up some of those 
birch logs." 

"But we accepted and ..." 

He held her tightly. He would 
never let her go. 

She whispered, "I like you bet


134 




 



ter this way, instead of all snarly 
and grouchy." She giggled. "I 
think we could phone and tell 
them you have a fever, darling. 
It wouldn't really be a lie." 

SHE made the call, winking at 
him as she gave worried 
noises about his symptoms. She 
hung up and said, "She was huffy and painfully sweet. Tonight 
the Grey nor s are at home. Darling, it would have been a crummy evening." 



"A . . . disastrous evening." 

"They play kid games all the 
time. That's what irks me. Remember in the summer? They 
had a scavenger hunt. If that 
isn't the height of silliness!" 

He looked at the fire glow reflected in her hair. 

"It isn't a bad game, baby." 

"What do you mean?" 

He shrugged. "Guess it depends, 
on who's playing it and what the 
prize is.""
