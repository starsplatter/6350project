ZEN By JEROME BIXBY 

ITS difficult, when you're on 
one of the asteroids, to keep 
from tripping, because it's 
almost impossible to keep your 
eyes on the ground. They never 
got around to putting portholes 
in spaceships, you know — unnecessary when you're flying by GB, 
and psychologically inadvisable, 




besides — so an asteroid is about 
the only place, apart from Luna, 
where you can really see the stars. 

There are so many stars in aa 
asteroid sky that they look like 
clouds; like massive, heaped-up 
silver clouds floating slowly 
around the inner surface of the 
vast ebony sphere that surrounds 


you and your tiny foothold. They 
are near enough to touch, and 
you want to touch them, but they 
are so frighteningly far away . . . 
and so beautiful: there's nothing 
in creation half so beautiful as 
an asteroid sky. 

You don't want to look down,, 
naturally. 

I HAD left the Lucky Pierre to 
search for fossils (I'm David 
Koontz, the Lucky Pierre's paleontologist). Somewhere off in 
the darkness on either side of me 
were Joe Hargraves, gadgeting 
for mineral deposits, and Ed 
Reiss, hopefully on the lookout 
for anything alive. The Lucky 
Pierre was back of us, her body 
out of sight behind a low black 
ridge, only her gleaming nose 
poking above like a porpoise 
coming up for air. When I looked 
back, I could see, along the jagged rim of the ridge, the busy 
reflected flickerings of the bubblecamp the techs were throwing 
together. Otherwise all was black,except for our blue-white torch 
beams that darted here and there 
over the gritty, rocky surface. 
. The twenty-nine of us were 
E. T. I. Team 17, whose assignment was the asteroids. We were 
four years and three months out 
,of Terra* and we'd reached Vesta 
right on schedule. Ten minutes 
after landing, we had known that 
the clod was part of the crust of 



Planet X — or Sorn, to give it its 
right name — one of the few such 
parts that hadn't been blown 
clean out of the Solar System. 

That made Vesta extra-special. 
It meant settling "down for a 
while. It meant a careful, monthslong scrutiny of Vesta's every 
square inch and a lot of her cubic 
ones, especially by the life-scientists. Fossils, artifacts, animate 
-life . . . a surface chunk of Sorn 
might harbor any of these, or all. 
Some we'd tackled already had 
a few. 

In a day or so, of course, we'd 
have the one-man beetles and 
crewboats out, and the floodlights 
orbiting overhead, and Vesta 
would be as exposed to us as a 
molecule on a microscreen. Then 
work would start in earnest. But 
in the meantime — and as usual — 
Hargraves, Reiss and I were out 
prowling, our weighted boots | 
clomping along in darkness. Captain Feldman had long ago given 
up trying to keep his scienceminded charges from galloping 
off alone like this. In spite of 
being a military man, Feld's * 
nice guy ; he just shrugs and says, 
"Scientists!" when we appear 
brightly at the airlock, waiting to 
be let out.

hardest for animate life, naturally. 

But I found it. 

¥ HAD crossed a long, rounded 
expanse of rock — lava, wonderfully colored — and was descending into a boulder-cluttered 
pocket. I was nearing the "bottom" of the chunk, the part that 
had been the deepest beneath 
Sorn's surface before the blow-up. 
It was the likeliest place to look 
for fossils. 

But instead of looking for fossils, my eyes kept rising to those 
incredible stars. You get that way 
particularly after several weeks 
of living in steel; and it was 
lucky that I got that way this 
time, or I might have missed the 
Zen. 

My feet tangled with a rock. 
1 started a slow, light-gravity fall, 
»nd looked down to catch my 
balance. My torch beam nickered 
across a small, red-furred teddybear shape. The light passed on. 
I brought it sharply back to 
target. 

My hair did not stand on end, 
regardless of what you've heard 
me quoted as saying. Why should 
it have, when I already knew 
Yurt so well — considered him,, in 
fact, one of my closest friends? 

The Zen was standing by a 
rock, one paw resting on it, ears 
cocked forward, its stubby hind 
legs braced ready to launch it 



into flight. Big yellow eyes 
blinked unemotionally" at the 
glare of the torch, and I cut down 
its brilliance with a twist of the 
polarizer lens. 

The creature stared at me, 
looking ready to jump halfway 
to Mars or straight at me if I 
made a wrong move. 

I addressed it in its own language, clucking my tongue and 
whistling through my teeth: 
"Suh, Zen—" 

In the blue-white light of the 
torch,' the Zen shivered. It didn't 
say anything. I thought I knew 
why. Three thousand years of 
darkness and silence . . . 

I said, "I won't hurt you,** 
again speaking in its own language. 

The Zen moved away from the 
rock, but not away from me. It 
came a little closer, actually, and 
peered up at my helmeted, mirror-glassed head — unmistakably 
the seat of intelligence, it appears, 
of any race anywhere. Its mouth, 
almost human-shaped, worked; 
finally words came. It hadn't 
spoken, except to itself, for three 
thousand years. 

"You . . . are not Zen," it said. 
"Why — how do you speak Zennacai?" 

It took me a couple of seconds 
to untangle the squeaking syllables and get any sense out of 
them. What I had already said 
to it were stock phrases that Yurt 



ZEN 



*5

had taught me; I knewstiil more, 
but I couldn't speak Zennacai 
fluently by any means. Keep this 
in mind, by the way: I barely 
knew the language, and the Zen 
could barely remember it. To 
save space, the following dialogue 
is reproduced without bumblings, 
blank stares and What-did-yousays? In reality, our talk lasted 
over an hour. 

"I am an Earthman," 1^ said. 
Through my earphones, when I 
spoke, I could faintly hear my 
own voice as the Zen must have 
heard it in Vesta's all but nonexistent atmosphere : tiny, metallic, 
cricketlike. 

"Eert . . . mn?" 
I pointed 'at the sky, the incredible sky. "From out there. 
From another .world." 

It thought about that for a 
while. I waited. We already knew 
that the Zens had been better astronomers at their peak than we 
*rere right now, even though 
they'd never mastered space 
travel; so I didn't expect this one 
to boggle at the notion of creatures from another world. It 
didn't. Finally it nodded, and I 
thought, as I had often before, 
how curious it was that this gesture should be common to Earthmen ancLZen. 

"So. Eert-mn," it said. "And 
you know what I am?" 

When I understood, I nodded, 
too. Then I said, "Yes," realizing 

66 



that the nod wasn't visible 
through the one-way glass of my 
helmet. 

"I am — last of Zen," it said. 

I said nothing. I was studying 
it closely, looking for the features 
which Yurt had described to us: 
the lighter red fur of arms and 
neck, the peculiar formation of 
flesh and horn on the lower abdomen. They were there. From 
the coloring, I knew this Zen was 
a female. 

The mouth worked again — not 
with emotion, I knew, but with 
the unfamiliar act of speaking. 
"I have been here for — for — ** 
she hesitated— "I don't know 
For five hundred of my years.' 

"For about three thousand of 
mine," I told her. 

AND then blank astonishmen* 
sank home in me — astonish 
ment at the last two words of her 
remark. I was already familia 
with the Zens' enormous intelligence, knowing Yuft as I did . . , 
but imagine thinking to qualify 
years with my when just out of 
nowhere a visitor from another 
planetary orbit pops up! And, 
there had been no special stress 
■ given the distinction, just clear, 
precise thinking, like Yurt's. 

I added, still a little awed: 
"We know how long ago your 
world died." 

"I was child then," she said. 
"I don't know—what happened.

I have wondered." She looked up 
at my steel-and-glass face; I 
must have seemed like a giant. 
Well, I suppose I was. "This— 
what we are on — was part of 
Sorn, I know. Was it — " She 
fumbled for a word— "was it 
atom explosion?" f 

I told her how Sorn had gotten 
careless with its hydrogen atoms 
and had blown itself over half of 
creation. (This the E. T. I. Teams 
had surmised from scientific records found on Eros, as well as 
from geophysical evidence scattered throughout the other bodies.) 

"I was child," she said again 
after a moment. "But I remember — I remember things different 
from this. Air . . . heat . . . light 
. . . how do I live here?" 

Again I felt amazement at its 
intelligence; (and it suddenly occurred to me that astronomy and 
nuclear physics must have been 
taught in Sorn's "elementary 
schools" — else that my years and 
atom explosion would have been 
all but impossible). And now this 
old, old creature, remembering 
back three thousand years to 
childhood — probably to those 
"elementary schools" — remembering, and defining the differences in environment between 
then and now; and more, wondering at its existence in the 
different now — 
And then I got my own think


ing straightened out. I recalled 
some of the things we had 
learned about the Zen. 

Their average lifespan had been 
12,000 years or a little over. So 
the Zen before me was, by our 
standards, about twenty - five 
years old. Nothing at all strange 
about remembering, when you 
are twenty-five, the things that 
happened to you when you were 
seven ... 

But the Zen's question, even 
my rationalization of my reaction to it,- had given me a chill. 
Here was no cuddly teddy bear. 

This creature had been born 
before Christ! 

She had been alone for three 
thousand years, on a chip of bone 
from her dead world beneath a 
sepulchre of stars. The last and 
greatest Martian civilization, the 
L'hrai, had risen and fallen in 
her lifetime. And she was twentyfive years old. 

"How do I live here?" she 
asked again. 

I got back into my own framework of temporal reference, so 
to speak, and began explaining 
to a Zen what a Zen was. (I 
found out later from Yurt that 
biology, for the reasons which 
follow, was one of the most difficult studies; so difficult that 
nuclear physics actually preceded 
it!) I told her that the Zen had 
been, all evidence indicated, the 
toughest, hardest, longest-lived 



ZEN 



creatures God had ever cooked 
up: practically independent of 
their environment, no special 
ecological niche; just raw, stubborn, tenacious life, developed to 
a fantastic extreme — a greater 
force of life than any other 
known, one that could exist almost anywhere under practically 
any conditions — even floating in 
midspace, which, asteroid or no, 
this Zen was doing right now. 

The Zens breathed, all right, 
but it was nothing they'd had 
to do in order to live. It gave 
them nothing their incredible metabolism couldn't scrounge up 
out of rock or cosmic rays or 
interstellar gas or simply do without for a few thousand years. If 
the human body is a furnace, 
then the Zen body is a feeder 
pile. Maybe that, I thought, was 
what evolution always worked 
toward. 

"Please, will you kill me?-' the 
Zen said. 

I'D been expecting that. Two 
years ago, on the bleak surface 
of Eros, Yurt had asked Engstrom 
to do the same thing. But I asked, 
"Why?" although I knew what 
the answer would be, too. 

The Zen looked up at me. She 
was exhibiting every ounce of 
emotion a Zen is capable of, which 
is a lot; and I could recognize 
it, but not in any familiar terms. 
A tiny motion hens, a quiver 



there, but very quiet and still for 
the most part. And that was the 
violent expression:" restraint., 
Yurt, after two years of living 
with us, still couldn't understand 
why we found this confusing. 
Difficult, aliens — or being alien. 
"I've tried so often to do it 
myself," the Zen said softly. "But 
I can't. I can't even hurt myself. 
Why do I want you to kill me?" 
She was even quieter. Maybe she 
was crying. "I'm alone. Five hundred years, Eert-mn — not too 
long. I'm still young. But what 
good is it — life — when there are 
no other Zen?" 

"How do you know there are 
no other Zen?" 

"There are no others," she said 
almost inaudibly. I suppose a human girl might have shrieked it. 

A child, I thought, when your 
world blew up. And you survived. 
Now you're a young three-thousand-year-old woman . . . uneducated, afraid, probably crawling 
with neuroses. Even so, in your 
thousand-year terms, young lady, 
you're not too old to change. 

"Will you kill me?" she asked 
again. 

And suddenly I was having one 
of those eye -popping third-row center views of the whole scene : 
the enormous, beautiful sky; the 
dead clod, Vesta; the little creature who stood there staring at me 
—the brilliant-ignorant, humanlike-alien, old-young creature who 



M 




 



was asking me to kill her. 

For a moment the human quality of her thinking terrified me 
. . . the feeling you might have 
waking up some night and finding your pet puppy sitting oh 
your chest, looking at you with 
wise eyes and white fangs gleaming .. . 

Then I thought of Yurt — 
smart, friendly Yurt, who had 
learned to laugh and wisecrack — 
and I came out of the jeebies. I 
realized that here was only a sick 
girl, no tiny monster. And if she 
were as resilient as Yurt . . . well, 
it was his problem. He'd probably 
pull her through. 

But I didn't pick her up. I 
made no attempt to take her back 
to the ship. Her tiny white teeth 
and tiny yellow claws were 
harder than steel; and she was, , 
I knew, unbelievably strong for 
her size. If she got suspicious or 
decided to throw a phobic tizzy, 
she could scatter shreds of me 
over a square acre of Vesta in 
less time than it would take me 
to yelp. 

"Will you — " she began again. 
I tried shakily, "Hell, no. Wait 
here." Then I had to translate it. 

T WENT back to the Lucky 
*- Pierre and got Yurt. We could 
do without him, even though he 
had beeh a big help. We'd taught 
him a lot— he'd been a child at 
the blow-up, too — and he'd 



taught us a lot. But this was 
more important, of course. 

When I told him what had 
happened, he was very quiet; crying, perhaps, just like a human 
being, with happiness. 

Cap Feldman asked me what 
was up, and I told him, and he 
said, "Well, I'll be blessed!" 

I said, "Yurt, are you sure you 
want us to keep hands off . . » 
just go off and leave you?" 

"Yes, please." 

Feldman said, "Well, I'll be 
blessed." 

Yurt, who spoke excellent English, said, "Bless you all." 

I took him back to where the 
female waited. From the ridge, I 
knew, the entire crew was watching through binocs. I set him 
down, and he fell to studying her 
intently. 

"I am not a Zen," I told her, 
giving my torch full brilliance 
for the crew's sake, "but Yurt 
here is. Do you see ... I mean, 
do you knew what you look 
like?" 

She said, "I can see enough of 
my own body to — and— yes . . ." 

"Yurt," I said, "here's the female we thought we might find. 
Take over." 

Yurt's eyes were fastened on 
the girl. 

"What— do I do now?" she 
whispered worriedly. 

"I'm afraid that's something 
only a Zen would know," I told 



ZEN

her, smiling inside my helmet. 
"I'm not a Zen. Yurt is." 

She turned to him. "You will 
tell me?" 

"If it becomes necessary." He 
moved closer to her, not even 
looking back to talk to me. "Give 
us some time to get acquainted, 
will you, Dave? And you might 
leave some supplies and a bubble 
at the camp when you move on, 
just to make things pleasanter." 

By this time he had reached 
the female. They were as still as 
space, not a sound, not a motion. 
I wanted to hang around, but I 
knew how I'd feel if a Zen, say, 
wouldn't go away if I were the 
last man alive and had just met 
the last woman. 

I moved my torch off them 
and headed back for the Lucky 
Pierre. We all had a drink to the 
saving of a great race that might 
have become extinct. Ed Reiss, 
though, had to do some worrying 
before he could down his drink. 

"What if they don't like each 
other?" he asked anxiously. 

"They don't have much 
choice," Captain Feldman said, 
always the realist. "Why do 
homely women fight for jobs on 
the most isolated space outposts?" 



Reiss grinned. "That's right 
They look awful good after < 
year or two in space." 

"Make that twenty-five by Zen 
standards or three thousand by 
ours," said Joe Hargraves, "and 
I'll bet they look beautiful to 
each other." 

We decided to drop our investigation of Vesta for the time 
being, and come back to it after 
the honeymoon. * 

Six months later, when we returned, there were twelve hundred Zen on Vesta! 

Captain Feldman was a realist 
but he was also a deeply moral 
man. He went to Yurt and said, 
"It's indecent! Couldn't the two 
of you control yourselves at least 
a little? Twelve hundred kids!" 

"We were rather surprised ourselves," Yurt said complacently. 
"But this seems to be how Zen 
reproduce. Can you have only 
half a child?" 

Naturally, Feld got the authorities to quarantine Vesta. Good 
God, the Zen could push us clear 
out of the Solar System in a couple of generations! 

I don't think they would, but 
you can't take such chances, can 
you?
