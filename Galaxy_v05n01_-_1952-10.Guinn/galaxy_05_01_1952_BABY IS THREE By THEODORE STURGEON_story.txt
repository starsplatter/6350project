BABY IS THREE By THEODORE STURGEON 

I FINALLY got in to see this 
Stern. He wasn't an old man 
at all. He looked up from his 
desk, flicked his eyes over me 
once, and picked up a pencil. "Sit 
over there, Sonny." 

I stood where I was until he 
looked up again. Then I said, 
"Look, if a midget walks in here. 
What do you say — sit over there, 
Shorty?" 

He put the pencil down again 
and stood up. He smiled. His 
smile was as quick and sharp as 
his eyes. "I was wrong," he said, 
"but how am I supposed to know 
you don't want to be called 
Sonny?" 

That was better, but I was still 
mad. "I'm fifteen and I don't 
have to like it. Don't rub my nose 
in it." 

He smiled again and said okay, 
and I went and sat down. 
"What's your name?" 
"Gerard." 
"First or last?" 
"Both," I said.

"Is that the truth?" • 

I said, "No. And don't ask me 

where I live either." 

He put down his pencil, "We're 

not going to get very far this 

way." 

"That's up to> you. What are 
you worried about? I got feelings 
of hostility? Well, sure I have. I 
got lots more things than that 
wrong with me or I wouldn't be» 
here. Are you going to let that 
stop you?" 

"Well, no, but— " 

"So what else is bothering you? 
How .you're going to get paid?" 
I took, out a thousand-dollar bill 
and laid it on the desk. "That's 
so you won't have to bill me. You 
keep track of it. Tell me when it's 
used up and I'll give you more. 
So you don't need my address. 
Wait," I said, when he reached 
toward the money. "Let it lay 
there. I want to be sure you and I 
are going to get along." 

TTE folded his hands. "I don't 
do business this way, Son — I 
mean, Gerard." \ 

"Gerry," I told him. "You do, 
if you do business with me." 

"You make things difficult, 
don't you? Where did you get a 
thousand dollars?" 

"I won a contest. Twenty-five 
words or less about how much 
fun it is to do my daintier underthingswith Sudso." I leaned forward. "This time it's the truth." 



"All right," he said. 

I was surprised. I think he 
knew it, but he didn't say anything more. Just waited for me 
to go ahead. 

"Before we start — if we start," 
I said, "I got to know something. 
The things I say to you — what 
comes out while you're working 
on me — is that just between us, 
like a priest or a lawyer?" 

"Absolutely," he said. 

"No matter what?" 

"No matter what." 

I watched him when he said 
it. I believed him. 

"Pick up your mpney," I said. 
"You're on." 

He didn't do it. He said, 
"As you remarked a minute ago, 
that is up to me. You can't buy 
these treatments like a candy bar. 
We have to work together. If 
either one of us can't do that, 
it's useless. You can't walk in 
on the first psychotherapist you 
find in the phone book and make 
any demand that occurs to you 
just because you can pay for it." 

I said tiredly, "I didn't get you 
out of the phone book and I'm 
not just guessing that you can 
help me. I winnowed through a 
dozen or more head-shrinkers before I decided on you." 

"Thanks," he said, and it looked as if he was going to laugh at 
me, which I never like. "Winnowed, did you say? Just how?" 

"Things you hear, things you 



GALAXY* SCIENCE FICTION 



reach You know. I'm not saying, 
so just file that with my street 
address." 

He looked at me for a long 
time. It was the first time he'd 
used those eyes on me for anything but a flash glance. Then he 
picked up the bill. ' 

"What do I do first?" I demanded. 

"What do you mean?" 

"How do we start?" 

"We started when you walked 
in here." 

So then I had to laugh. "All 
right, you got me. All I had was 
an opening. I didn't know where 
you would go from there, so I 
couldn't be there ahead of you." 

"That's very interesting," Stern 
said. "Do you usually figure everything out in advance?" 

"Always." 

"How often are you right?" 

"All the time. Except— but I 
don't have to tell you about no 
exceptions." 

He really grinned this time. "I 
see. One of my patients has been 
talking." 

"One of your ex-patients. Your 
patients don't talk." 

~"I ask them not to. That applies to you, too. What did you 
hear?" 

"That you know from what 
people say and do what they're 
about to say - and do, and that 
sometimes you let'm do it and 
Sometimes you don't. How did 



you learn to do that?" 

He thought a minute; "I guess 
I was born with an eye for details* 
and then let myself make enough 1 
mistakes ^ith enough people un^ 
til I learned not to make too 
many more. How did you learn 
to do it?" 

I said, "You answer that andI won't have to come back here." 

"You really don't know?" 

"I wish I did. Look, this isn't 
getting us anywhere, is it?" 

He shrugged. "Depends on 
where you want to go." He 
paused, and I got the eyes full 
strength again. "Which thumbnail description of psychiatry do 
you believe at the moment?" 

"I don't get you." 

STERN slid open a desk drawer and took out a blackened 
pipe. He smelled it, turned it over 
while looking at me. "Psychiatry, 
attacks the onion of the self, removing layer after layer until 
it gets down to the little sliver of 
unsullied ego. Or: psychiatry 
drills like an oil well, down and 
sidewise and down again, through: 
all the muck and rock, until it 
strikes a layer that yields. Or: 
psychiatry grabs a handful of 
sexual motivations and throws 
them on the pinball-maehine of 
your life, so they bounce on down 
against episodes. Want more?" 

I had to laugh. "That last one 
was pretty good."

"That last one was pretty bad. . 
They are all bad. They all try to 
simplify something which is complex by its very nature. The only 
thumbnail you'll get from me is 
this: no one knows what's really 
wrong with you but you ; no one 
can find a cure for it but you; no 
one but you can identify it as a 
cure; and once you find it, no one 
but you can do anything about 
it." 

"What are you here for?" 
"To listen." 

"I don't have to pay somebody 
no day's wage every hour just to 
listen." 

"True. But you're convinced 
that I listen selectively." 

"Am I?" I wondered about it. 
"I guess I am. Well, don't you?" 

"No, but you'lf never believe 
that." 

I laughed. He asked me what 
that was for. I said, "You're not 
calling me Sonny." 

"Not you." He shook his head 
slowly. He was watching me while 
he did it, so his eyes slid in their 
sockets as his head moved. "Whatis it you want to know about 
yourself, that made you worried 
I might tell people?" 

"I want to find out why I killed 
somebody," I said right away. 

It didn't faze him a bit. "Lie 
down over there." 
T got up. "On that couch?" 

He nodded. 

As I stretched out self-con


sciously, I said, 'T feel like I'm 
in some damn cartoon." 

"What cartoon?" 

"Guy's built like a bunch of 
grapes," I said, looking at the 
ceiling. It was pale gray. 

"What's the caption?" 

" 'I got trunks full of 'em'." 

"Very good," he said quietly. 

I looked at him carefully. I 
knew then he was the kind of guy 
who laughs way down deep when 
he laughs at all. 

He said, "I'll use that in a 
book of case histories some time. 
But it won't include yours» What 
made you throw that in?" When 
I didn't answer, he got up and 
moved to a chair behind me 
where I couldn't see him. "You 
can quit testing, Sonny. I'm good 
enough for your purposes." 

I clenched my jaw so hard, my 
back teeth hurt. Then I relaxed. 
I relaxed all over. It was wonderful. "All right," I said, "I'm sorry." He didn't say anything, but 
I had that feeling again that he 
was laughing. Not at me, though. 

"How old are you?" he asked 
me suddenly.' 

"Uh— fifteen." 

"Uh — fifteen," he repeated. 
"What does the 'uh' mean?" 

"Nothing. I'm fifteen." 

"When I asked your age, you 
hesitated because some other 
number popped up. You discarded that and substituted 'fifteen.' " 



* 




 



"The hell I did! I am fifteen!"* 

"I didn't say you weren't." His 
voice came patiently. "Now what 
was the other number?" 

I got mad again. "There wasn't 
any other number! What do you 
want to go pryin' my grunts 
apart for, trying to plant this and 
that and make it mean what you 
think it ought to mean?" 

He was silent. 

"I'm fifteen," I said defiantly, 
and then, "I don't like being only 
fifteen. You know that. I'm not 
trying to insist I'm fifteen." 

He just waited, still not saying 
anything. 

I felt defeated. "The number 
was eight." 

"So you're eight. And your 
name?" 

"Gerry." I got up on one elbow, twisting my neck around so 
I could see him. He had his pipe 
apart and was sighting through 
the stem at the desk lamp. "Gerry, without no 'uh!' " 

"All right," he said mildly, 
making me feel real foolish. 

I leaned back and closed my 
eyes. 

Eight,! thought. Eight. 

"It's cold in here," I complained. 

Eight. Eight, plate, state, hate. 
I ate from the plate of the state 
and I nate. I didn't like any of 
that and I snapped my eyes open. 
The ceiling was still gray. It was 
all right. Stern was somewhere 



behind me with his pipe, and he 
was all right. I took two deep 
breaths, three, and then let my 
eyes close. Eight. Eight years old. 
Eight, hate. Years, fears. Old, 
cold. Damn it! I twisted and 
twitched on the couch, trying to 
find a way to keep the cold out. 
I ate from the plate of the — 

1 GRUNTED and with my 
mind I took all the eights 
and all the rhymes and everything they stood for, and made it 
all black. But it wouldn't stay 
black. I had to put something 
there, so I made a great big luminous figure eight and just let 
it hang there. But it turned on 
its side and inside the loops it 
began to shimmer. It was like one 
of those movie shots through binoculars. I was going to have to 
look through whether I liked it 
or not. 

Suddenly I q"uit fighting it and 
let it wash over me. The binoculars came close, closer, and then 
I was there. 

Eight. Eight years old, cold. 
Cold as a bitch in the ditch. The 
ditch was by a railroad. Last 
year's weeds were scratchy straw. 
The ground was red, and when 
it wasn't slippery, clingy mud, it 
was frozen hard like a flowerpot. 
It was hard like that now, dusted 
with hoar-frost, cold as the winter light that pushed up over the 
hills. At night the lights were 



BABY IS THREE 



9 



warm, and they were all in other 
people's houses. In the daytime 
the sun was in somebody else's 
house too, for all the good it did 
me. 

I was dying in that ditch. Last 
night it was as good a place as 
any to sleep, and this morning it 
was as good a place as any to die. 
Just as well. Eight years old, the 
sick -sweet taste of pork-fat and 
wet bread from somebody's garbage, the thrill of terror when 
you're stealing a gunnysack and 
you hear a footstep. 

- And I heard a footstep. 

I'd been curled up on my side. 
I whipped over on my stomach 
because sometimes they kick your 
belly. I covered my head with my 
arms and that was as far as I 
could get. 

After a while I rolled my eyes 
up and looked without moving. 
There was a big shoe there. There 
was an ankle in the shoe, and another shoe close by. I lay there 
waiting to get tromped. Not that 
I cared much any more, but it 
was such a damn shame. All these 
months on my own, and they'd 
never caught up with me, never 
even come close, and now this. 
It was such a shame I started to 
cry. 

- The shoe took me under the 
armpit, but it was not a kick. It 
rolled me over. I was so stiff 
from the cold, 1 went over like 
a plank. I just kept my arms over 



my face and head and .lay there 
with my eyes closed. For some 
reason I stopped crying. I think 
people only cry when there's a 
chance of getting help from 
somewhere. 

When nothing happened, I 
opened my eyes and shifted my 
-forearms a little so I could see up. 
There was a man standing over 
me and he was a mile high. He 
had on faded dungarees and an 
old Eisenhower jacket with deep 
sweat-stains under the arms. His 
face was shaggy, like the guys 
who can't grow what you could 
call a beard, but still don't shave. 

He said, "Get up." 

I looked down at his shoe, but 
he wasn't going to kick me. I 
pushed up a little and almost fell 
down again, except he put his big 
hand where my back would hit 
it. I lay against it for a second 
because I had to, and then got up 
to where I had one knee on the 
ground. 

■ "Come on," he said. "Let's go." 

I swear I felt my bones creak, 
but I made it. I brought a round 
white stone up with me as I stood. 
I hefted the stone. -T had to look 
at it to see if I was really holding 
it, my fingers were that cold. I 
told him, "Stay away from me or 
I'll bust you in the teeth with this 
rock." 

His hand came out and down 
so fast, I never saw the way he 
got one finger between my palm

and the rock, and flicked it out of 
my grasp. I started to cuss at 
him, but he just turned his back" 
and walked up the embankment 
toward the tracks. He put his 
chin, on his shoulder and said, 
"Come on, will you?" 

HE didn't chase me, so I didn't 
run. He didn't talk to me, so 
I didn't argue. He didn't hit me, 
so I didn't get mad. I went along 
after him. He waited for me. He 
puF out his hand to me arid I 
spit at it. So he went on, up to 
the tracks, o«t of my sight. I 
clawed my way up. The blood 
was beginning to move in my 
hands and feet and they felt like 
four point-down porcupines. 
When I got up to the roadbed, 
the man was standing there waiting for me. 

The track was level just there, 
but as I turned my head to look 
along it, it seemed to be a hill 
that was steeper and steeper and 
turned over above me. And next 
thing you know, I was lying flat 
en my back looking up at the 
cold sky. 

The man came over and sat 
down on the rail near me. He 
didn't try to touch me. I gasped 
for breath a couple of times, .and 
suddenly felt I'd be all right if 
I could sleep for a minute — just 
a little minute. I closed' my eyes. 
The man stuck his finger m my 
. ribs, hard. It hurt. 



"Don't sleep," he said. 

I looked at him. 

He said, "You're frozen stiff 
and weak with hunger. I want to 
take you home and get you warmed up and fed. But it's a long 
haul up that way, and you won't 
make it by yourself. If I carry 
you, will that be the same to you 
as if you walked it?" 

"What are you going to do 
when you get me home?" 

"I told you." 

"All right," I said. 

He picked me up and carried 
me down the track. If he'd said 
anything else in the world, I'd 
of laid right down where I was 
until I froze to death. Anyway, 
what did he want to ask me for, 
one way or the other? I couldn't 
of done anything. 

f stopped thinking about it 
and dozed off. 

I woke up once when he turned off the right o£ way. He dove 
into the woods. There was no 
path, but he seemed to know 
where he was going. The fiext 
time I woke from a crackling 
noise. He was carrying me over 
a frozen pond and the ice was 
giving under his feet. He didn't 
hurry. I looked down and saw 
the white cracks raying out under 
his feet, and it didn't seem to 
matter a bit. I bleared off again. 

He put me down at last. We 
were there. "There" was inside a 
room. It was very warm. He put 



IAIY IS THREE 



ft 



me on my feet and I snapped out 
of it in a hurry. The first thing I 
looked for was the door. I saw it 
and jumped over there and put 
my back against the wall beside 
it, in case I wanted to lea ve v Then 
I looked around. 

It was a big room. One wall 
was rough rock and the rest was 
logs with stuff shoved between 
them. There was a big fire going 
in the rock wall, not in a fireplace, 
exactly; it was a sort of hollow 
place. There was an old auto 
battery on a shelf opposite, with 
two yellowing electric light bulbs 
dangling by wires from it. There 
was a table, some boxes and a 
couple of three-legged stools. The 
air had a haze of smoke and such 
a wonderful, heartbreaking, candy-and-crackling smell of food 
that a little hose squirted inside 
my mouth. 

' The man said. "What have I 
got here, Baby?" 

And the room was full of kids. 
Well, three of them, but somehow 
they seemed to be more than 
three kids. There was a girl about 
my age — eight, I mean — with 
blue paint on the side of her face. 
She had an easel and a palette 
with lots of paints and a fistful of 
brushes, but she. wasn't using the 
brushes. She was smearing the 
paint on with her hands. Then 
there was a little Negro girl 
about five with great big eyes 
who stood gaping at me. And in 



a wooden crate, set up on two 
sawhorses to make a kind of 
bassinet, was a baby. I guess 
about three or four months old. 
Ijt did what babies do, drooling 
some, making small bubbles, 
waving its hands around very 
aimless, and kicking. 

WHEN the man spoke, the girl 
at the easel looked at me 
and then at the baby. The baby 
just kicked and drooled. 
The girl said, "His name's 
Gerry. He's mad." 

"What's he mad at?" the man 
asked. He was looking at the" 
baby. 

"Everything," said the girl, 
"Everything and everybody." 

"Where'd he come from?" 

I said, "Hey, what is this?" but 
nobody paid any attention. The 
man kept asking questions at the 
baby and the girl kept answering. 
Craziest thing I ever saw. 

"He ran away from a state 
school," the girl- said. "They fed 
him enough, but no one bleshed 
with him." 

That's what she said — ■ 
"bleshed." 

I opened the door then and 
cold air hooted in. "You louse," 
I said to the man, "you're from 
the school." 

"Close the door, Janie," said 
the man. The girl at the easel 
didn't move, but the door banged 
shut behind me. I tried to open 



12 




 



it and it wouldn't move. I let out 
a howl, yanking at it. 

"I think you ought to stand in 
the corner," said the man. "Stand 
him in the corner, Janie." 

Janie looked at me. One of the 
three-legged stools sailed across 
to me. It hung in midair and 
turned on its side. It nudged me 
with its flat seat. I jumped back 
and it came after me. I dodged 
to the side, and that was the corner. The stool came on. I tried 
to bat it down and just hurt my 
hand. I ducked and it went lower 
than I did. I put one hand on it 
and tried to vault over it, but it 
just fell and so did I. I got up 
again and stood in the corner, 
trembling. The stool turned right 
side up and sank to the floor in 
front of me. 

The man said, "Thank you, 
Janie." He turned to me. "Stand 
there and be quiet, you. I'll get 
to you later. You shouldn'ta 
kicked up all that fuss." And 
then, to the baby, he said, "He 
got anything we need?" 

And again it was the little girl 
who answered. She said, "Sure. 
He's the One." 

"Well," said the man. "What 
do you know!" He came over. 
"Gerry, you can live here. I don't 
come from the school. I'll never 
turn you in." 

"Yeah, huh?" 

"He hates you," said Janie. 
"What am I supposed ' to do 



about that?" he wanted to know. 

Janie turned her head to look 
into the. bassinet. "Feed him." 
The man nodded and began fiddling around the fire. 

Meanwhile, the little Negro 
girl had been standing in the one 
spot with her big eyes right out 
on her cheekbones, looking at me. 
Janie went back to her painting 
and the baby just lay there same 
as always, so I stared right back 
at the little Negro girl. I snapped, 
"What the devil are you gawking 
at?" 

She grinned at me. "Gerry hoho," she said, and disappeared. I 
mean she really disappeared, went 
out like a light, leaving hqr 
clothes where she "had been. Her 
little dress billowed in the air 
and fell in a heap where she had 
been, and that was that. She was 
gone. 

"Gerry hee-hee," I heard. I 
looked up, and there she was, 
stark naked, wedged in a space 
where a little outcropping on the 
rock wall stuck out just below 
the ceiling. The second I saw her 
she disappeared again. 

"Gerry ho-ho," she said. Now 
she was on top of the row of 
boxes they used as storage 
shelves, over on the other side of 
the room. 

"Gerry hee-hee!" Now she was 
under the table. "Gerry ho-ho!" 
This time she was right in the 
corner with me, crowding me. 



I ABY IS THREE

I yelped and tried to get out 
of the way and bumped the stooL 
I was afraid of it, so I shrank 
back again and the little girl was 
gone. 

The man glanced over his 
shoulder from where he was 



working at the fire. "Cut it out, 
you kids," he said. 

THERE was a silence, and 
then the girl came slowly out 
from the bottom row of shelves. 
She walked across to her dress 




14 




 



and put it on. 

"How did you do that?" I 
wanted to know. 

"Ho-ho," she said. 

Janie said, "It's easy. She's 
really twins." 

"Oh," I said. Then another girl, 
exactly the same, came from 
somewhere in the shadows and 
stood beside the first. They were 
identical. They stood side by 
side and stared at me. This time 
I let them stare. 

"That's Bonnie and Beanie,** 
said the painter. "This is Baby 
and that — " she indicated the 
man— "that's Lone. And I'm 
Janie." 

I couldn't think of what to say, 
so I said, "Yeah." 

Lone said, "Water, Janie." He 
held up a pot. I heard water 
trickling, but didn't see anything. 
"That's enough," he said, and 
hung the pot on a crane. He picked up a cracked china plate and 
brought it over to me. It was full 
of stew with great big lumps of 
meat in it, and thick gravy and 
dumplings and carrots. "Here, 
Gerry. Sit down:" 

I looked at the stool. "On 
that?" 

"Sure." 

"Not me," I said. I took the 
plate and hunkered down against 
the wall. 

"Hey," he said after a time. 
"Take it easy. We've all had 
chow. No one's going to snatch it 



away from you. Slow down!" 

I ate even faster than before. 
I was almost finished when I 
threw it all up. Then for some 
reason my head hit the edge of 
the stool. I dropped the plate and 
spoon and slumped there. I felt 
real bad. 

Lone came over and looked at 
me. "Sorry, kid," he said. "Clean 
up, will you, Janie?" 

Right in front of my eyes, the 
mess on the floor disappeared. I 
didn't care about that or anything else just then. I felt the 
man's hand on the side of my 
neck. Then he tousled my hair. 

"Beanie, get him a blanket. 
Let's all go to sleep. He ought to 
rest a while." 

I felt the blanket go around 
me, and I think I was asleep before he put me down. 

I don't know how much later 
it was when I woke up. I didn't 
know where I was and that scared 
me. I raised my head and saw the 
dull glow of the embers in the 
fireplace. Lone was stretched out 
on it in his clothes. Janie's easel 
stood in the reddish blackness 
like some great preying insect. I 
saw the baby's head pop" up out 
of the bassinet, but I couldn't 
tell whether he was looking 
straight at me or away. Janie 
was lying on the floor near the 
door and the twins were on the 
©Id table. Nothing moved except 
the baby's head, bobbing a little. 



I got to my feet and looked 
around the room. Just a room, 
only the one door. I tiptoed toward it. When I passed Janie, she 
opened her eyes. 

"What's the matter?" she 
whispered. 

"None of your business," I told 
her. I went to the door as if I 
didn't care, but I watched her. 
She didn't do anything. The door 
was as solid tight closed as when 
I'd tried it before. 

JL went back to Janie. She just 
looked up at me. She wasn't 
scared. I told her, "I got to go to 
the john." 

. "Oh," she said. "Why'n't you 
say so?" 

Suddenly I grunted and grabbed my guts. The feeling I had 
I can't begin to talk abput. I 
acted as if it was a pain, but it 
wasn't. It was like nothing else 
that ever happened to me before. 

"Okay," Janie said. "Go on 
back to bed." 

"But I got to—" 

"You got to what?" 

"Nothing." It was true. I didn't 
have to go no place. 

"Next time tell me right away. 
I don't mind." 

I didn't say anything. I went 
back to my blanket. 

THAT'S all?" said Stern. I 
lay on the couch and looked 
up at the gray ceiling. He asked, 
"How old are you?" 




 



"Fifteen," I said dreamily. He 
Waited until, for me, the gray 
ceiling acquired walls and a floor, 
a rug and lamps and a desk and 
a chair with Stern in it. I sat 
up and held my head a second, 
and then I looked at him. He was 
fooling with his pipe and looking 
at me. "What did you do to me?" 

"I told you. I don't do anything here. You do it." 

"You hypnotized me." 

"I did not." His voice was 
quiet, but he really meant it. 

"What was all that, then? It 
was . . ..it was like it was happening for real all over again." 

"Feel anything?" 

"Everything." I shuddered. 
"Every damn thing. What was 
it?" 

"Anyone doing it feels better 
afterward. You can go over it all 
again now any time you want to, 
and every time you do, the hurt 
in it will be less. You'll see." 

It was the first thing to amaze 
me in years. I chewed on it and 
then asked, "If I did it by myself, 
how come it never happened before?" 

"It needs someone to listen." 

"Listen? Was I talking?" 

"A blue streak." 

"Everything that happened?" 

"How can I know? I wasn't 
there. You were." 

"You don't-believe it happened, 
do you? Xhose disappearing kids 
and the footstool and all?" 

I AIT IS T H-R EE 



He shrugged. "I'm not in the 
business of believing or not believing. Was it real to you?" 

"Oh, hell, yes!" 

"Well, then, that's all that matters. Is that where you live, with 
those people?" 

I bit off a fingernail that had 
been bothering me. "Not for a 
long time. Not since Baby was 
three." I looked at him. "You remind me of Lone." 

"Why?" 

"I don't know. No, you don't," 
I added suddenly. "I don't know 
what made me say that." I lay 
down abruptly. 

The ceiling was gray and the 
lamps weft dim. I heard the pipestem click against his teeth. I lay 
there for a long time. 

"Nothing happens," I told him. 

"What did you expect to happen?" 

"Like before." 

"There's something there that 
wants out. Just let it come." 

It was as if there was a revolving drum in my head, and on 
it were photographed the places 
and things and people I was after. 
And it was as if the drum was • 
spinning very fast, so fast I 
couldn't tell one picture from 
another. I made it stop, and it 
stopped at a blank segment. I 
spun it again, and stopped- it 
again. 

"Nothing happens,"-. I said.*. 
"Baby is three;" he repeated. 

\r 



"Oh," I said. "That." I closed 
my eyes. • 

That might be it. Might, sight, 
night, light. I might have the 
sight of a light in the night. Maybe the baby. Maybe the sight of 
the baby at night because of the 
light ... 

THERE was night after night 
when I lay on that blanket, 
and a lot of nights I didn't. Something* was going on all the time 
in Lone's house. Sometimes I 
slept in the daytime. I guess the 
only time everybody slept at once 
was when someone was sick, like 
me. the first time I arriyed there. 
It was always sort of dalk in the 
room, the same night and day, 
the fire going, the two old bulbs 
hanging yellow by their wires 
from the battery. When they got 
too dim, Janie fixed the battery 
and they got bright againr 

Janie did everything that needed doing, whatever no one else 
felt like doing. Everybody else 
did things, too. Lone was out a 
lot. Sometimes he used the twins 
to help him, but you never- missed 
them, because they'd be here and 
gone and back again bing! like 
that. And Baby, he just stayed in 
his bassinet. 

I did things myself. I cut wood 
for the fire and I put up more 
shelves, and then I'd go swimming with Janie and the twins 
sometimes. And I talked to Lone. 



I didn't do a thing that the others 
couldn't do, but they all did 
things I couldn't do. I was mad, 
mad all the time about that. But 
I wouldn't of known what to do 
with myself if I wasn't mad all 
the time about something or 
other. It didn't keep us from 
Meshing, Bleshing, that was Janie's word. She said Baby told it 
to her. She said it meant everyone 
all together being something, even 
if they all did different things. 
Two arms, two legs, one body, 
one head, all working together, 
although a head can't walk and 
arms can't think. Lone said maybe it was a mixture of "blending" 
and "meshing," but I don't think 
he believed that himself. It was 
a lot more than that. 

Baby talked all the time. He 
was like a broadcasting station 
that runs twenty-four hours a 
day, and you can get what it's 
sending any time you" tune in, but 
it'll keep sending whether you 
tune in or not. When I say he 
talked, I don't mea*n exactly that. 
He semaphored mostly. You'd 
think those wandering, vague 
movements of his hands and arms 
and legs and head were meaningless, but they weren't. It was 
semaphore, only instead of a symbol for a sound, or such like, the 
movements were whole thoughts. 

I mean spread the left hand 
and shake the right high up, and 
thump with the left heel, and it 



ie 




 



means, "Anyone who thinks a 
starling is a pest just don't knO& 
anything about how a starling 
thinks" or something like that. 

Lone couldn't read the stuff 
and neither could I. The twins 
could, but they didn't give a 
damn. 'Janie used to watch him 
all the time. He always knew 
what you meant if you wanted 
to ask him something, and he'd 
tell Janie and she'd say what it 
was. Part of it, anyway. Nobody 
could get it all, not even Janie. 
Lone once told me that all babies 
know that semaphore. But when 
nobody receives it, they quit doing it and pretty soon they forget. They almost forget. There's 
always some left. That's why certain gestures are funny the world 
over, and certain others make 
you mad. But like everything 
else Lone said, I don't know 
whether he believed it or not. 

All I know is Janie would sit 
there and paint her pictures and 
watch Baby, and sometimes she'd 
bust out laughing, and sometimes 
she'd get the twins and make 
them watch and they'd laugh, 
too, or they'd wait till he was 
finished what he was saying and 
then they'd creep off to a corner 
and whisper to each other about 
it. Baby never grew any. Janie 
did, and the twins, and so did I, 
but not Baby. He just lay there. 

Janie kept his stomach full and 
cleaned him up every two or three 



days. He didn't cry and he didn't 
make any trouble. No one ever 
went near him. 

JANIE showed every picture 
she painted to Baby, before 
she cleaned the boards and painted new ones. She had to clean 
them because she only had three 
of them. It was x a good thing, too, 
because I'd hate to think what 
that place would of been like if 
she'd kept them all; she did four 
or five a day. Lone and the twins 
were kept hopping getting turpentine for her. She could shift 
the paints back into the little 
pots on her easel without any 
trouble, just by looking at the 
picture one color at a time, but 
turps was something else again'. 
She told me that Baby remembered all her pictures and that's 
why she didn't have to keep 
them. They were all pictures of 
machines and gear-trains and 
mechanical linkages and what 
lcfcked like electric circuits and 
things like that. I never thought 
too much about them. 

I went out with Lone to get 
some turpentine and a couple of 
picnic hams, one time. We went 
through the woods to the railroad 
track and down a couple of miles 
to where we could see the glow of 
a town. Then the woods again, 
and some alleys, and a back 
street. 

Lone was like always, walking 



BABY IS THREE

along, thinking, thinking. 
• We came to a hardware store 
and he went up and looked at the 
lock and came back to where I 
was waiting, shaking his head. 
Then we found a general store. 
Lone grunted and we went and 
stood in the shadows by the door. 
I' looked in. 

All of a sudden, Beanie was in 
there, naked like she always was 
wherj she traveled like that. She 
came and opened the door from 
the inside. We went in and Lone 
closed it and locked it. 

"Get along home, Beanie," he 
said, "before you catch' your 
death." 

She grinned at me and said, 
**Ho-ho," and disappeared. 

We found a pair of fine hams 
and a two-gallon can of -turpentine. I took a bright yellow ballpoint pen and Lone cuffed me 
and made me put it back. 

"We only take what we need," 
he told me. 

After we left, Beanie came back 
and Rocked the door and went 
home again. I only went with 
Lone a few times, when he had 
more to- get than he could carry 
easily. 

I was there about three years. 
That's all I can remember about 
it. Lone was there or he was out* 
and you could hardly tell the 
difference. The twins were with 
each other most of the time. I 
got to like Janie a lot, but we 



never talked much. Barby talked 
-*11 the time, only I don't know 
what about. 

We were all busy, and we 
bleshed. * 

T SAT up on the couch sud-*• denly. 

Stern said, "What's the matter?" 

"Nothing's the matter. This 
isn't getting me any place." 

"You said that when you'd 
barely started. Do you think 
you've accomplished anything 
since then?'' 

"Oh, yeah, but — " 

"Then how can you be sure 
you're right this time?" When I 
didn't say anything^ he asked 
me, "Didn't you like this last 
stretch?" 

I said angrily, "I didn't like or 
not like. It didn't mean nothing. 
It was just — ju«t talk." 

"So what was the difference between this last session and what 
happened before?" 

"My gosh, plenty! The first 
one, I felt everything. It was all 
really happening tcv me. But this 
time — nothing." 

"Why do you suppose that 
was?" 

"I don't know. You tell me." 

"Suppose," he said thoughtfufly, "that there was some episode 
so unpleasant to you that you 
wouldn't dare relive it." 

"Unpleasant? You think freez


90 




 



4ng to. death : isn't unpleasant?" 

"There are all kinds of unpleasantness. Sometimes the very thing 
you're looking for — the . thing 
that'll clear up your trouble- — is 
so revolting to you that you won't 
go near it. Or you try to hide it. 
Wait," he said suddenly, "maybe 'revolting' and 'unpleasant' are 
inaccurate words to use. It might 
be something very desirable to 
you. It's just that you don't want 
to get straightened out." 

"I want to get straightened 
out." 

He waited as if he had to clear 
something up in his mind, and 
then said, "There's something in 
that 'Baby is three' phrase that 
bounces you away. Why is that?" 

"Damn if I know." 

"Who said it?" 

"I dunno . . .uh ..." 

He grinned. "Uh?" 

I grinned back at him-- "I said 
it." 

"Okay. When?" 

I quit grinning. He leaned forward, then got up. 

"What's the matter?" I asked. 

"I didn't think anyone could 
be that mad." I didn't say anything. He went over to his desk. 
"You don't want to go on any 
more, do you?" 

"No." 

"Suppose I told you you want 
to quit because you're right on 
the very edge of finding out what 
you want to know?" 

BABY IS THREE 



"Why don't you tell me and 
see what I do?" 

He just shook his head. "I'm 
not telling you anything. Go on, 
leave if you want to. I'll give you 
back your change." 

"How many people quit just 
when they're on top of the an-* 
swer?" 

"Quite a few." 

"Well, I ain't going to." I lay 
down. 

.He didn't laugh and he, didn't 
say, "Good," and he didn't make 
any fuss about it: He just picked 
up his phone and said, "Cancel 
everything for this afternoon," 
and went back to his chair, 'up 
there out of my sight. 

IT was very quiet in there. He 

had the place soundproofed. 

I said, "Why do you suppose 
Lone let me live there so long 
when I couldn't do any of the 
things that the other kids could?" 

"Maybe you could." 

"Oh, no," I said positively. "I 
used to try. I was strong for a 
kid my age and I knew how to 
keep my mouth shut, but aside 
from those two things I don't 
think I was any different from 
any kid. I don't think I'm any 
different right now, except what 
difference there might be from 
living with Lone and his bunch." 

"Has this anything to do with 
'Baby is three'?" 

I looked up at the gray ceiling. 

21 



•*'Baby is three. Baby is three. I 
went up to a big house with a 
winding drive that ran under a 
sort of theater- marquee thing. 
Baby is three. Baby . . ." 

"How old are you?" 

"Thirty-three," I said, and the 
next thing you know I was up 
off that couch like it was hot, and 
heading for the door. 

"Don't be foolish," Stern said. 
"Want me to waste a whole afternoon?" 

"What's that to me? I'm paying for it." 

"All right, it's up to you." 

I went back. "I don't like any 
part of this," I said. 

"Good. We're getting warm 
then." 

"What made me say 'Thirtythree?' I ain't thirty-three. I'm 
fifteen. And another thing . . ." 

"Yes?" 

"It's about that . 'Baby is 
three." It's me saying it, all right. 
But when I think about it — it's 
not my voice." 

"Like thirty-three's not your 
age?" 

"Yeah," I whispered. 

"Gervy," he said warmly, 
v "there's nothing to be afraid of." 

T REALIZED I was breathing 
-■- too hard. I pulled myself together. I said, "I don't like remembering saying things in 
somebody else's voice." 

"Look," he told me. "This 



head-shrinking business, as you 
called it a while back, isn't what 
most people think. When I go with 
you into the world of your mind 
— or when you go yourself, for 
that matter — what we find isn't 
so very different from the socalled real world. It seems so at 
first, because the patient comes 
out with all sorts of fantasies and 
irrationalities and weird experiences. But everyone lives in that 
kind of world. When one of the 
ancients coined the phrase 'truth 
is stranger than fiction,' he was 
talking about that. 

"Everywhere we go, everything 
we do, we're surrounded by symbols, by things so familiar we 
don't ever look at them or don't 
see them if we do look. If anyone 
ever could report to you exactly 
what he saw and thought while 
walking ten feet down the street, 
you'd get the most twisted, clouded, partial picture you ever ran 
across. And nobody ever looks at 
what's around him with any kind 
of attention until he gets into a 
place like this. The fact that he's 
looking at past events doesn't 
matter; what counts is that he's 
seeing clearer than he ever could 
before, just because, for once, he's 
trying. 

"Now — about this 'thirty -three' 
business. I don't think a man 
could get a nastier shock than to 
find he has someone else's memories. The ego is too important to

let slide that way. But consider: 
all your thinking is done in code 
and you have the key to only 
about a tenth of it. So you run 
into a stretch of code which is 
abhorrent to you. Can't you see 
that the only way you'll find the 
key to it is to stop avoiding it?" 

"You mean I'd started to remember with . . . with somebody 
else's mind?" 

"It looked like that to you for 
a while, which means something. 
Let's try to find out what." 

"All right." I felt sick. I felt 
tired. And I suddenly realized 
that being sick and being tired 
was a way of trying to get out of 
it. 

"Baby is three," he said. 

Baby is maybe. Me, three, 
thirty-three, me, you Kew you. 

"Kew!" I yelled. Stern didn't 
say anything. "Look, I don't 
know why, but I think I know 
how to get to this, and this isn't 
the way. Do you mind if I try 
something else?". 

"You're the doctor," he said. 
■ . I had to laugh. Then I closed 
my eyes. 

fpHERE, through the edges of 
the hedges, the ledges and 
wedges of windows were shouldering up to the sky. The lawns 
were sprayed-on green, neat and 
clean, and all the flowers looked 
as if they were afraid to let their 
petals break and be untidy. 

BABY IS THREE 



I walked up the drive' in my 
shoes. I'd had to wear shoes and 
my feet couldn't breathe. I didn't 
want to go to the house, but I had 
to. 

I went up the steps between the 
big white columns and looked at 
the doer. I wished I could sec 
through it, but it was too white 
and thick. There was a window 
the shape of a- fan over it, too 
high up, though, and a window on 
each side of it, but they were all 
crudded up with colored glass. 
I hit on the door with my hand 
and left dirt on it. 

Nothing happened, so I hit it 
again. It got snatched open and 
a tall, thin colored, woman stood 
there. "What you waat?" 

I said I had to see Miss Kew. 

"Well, Miss Kew don't want to 
see the likes of you," she said. 
She talked too loud. "You got a 
dirty face." "* 

I started to get mad then. I 
was already pretty sore about 
having "to come here, walking 
around near people in the daytime and all. I said, "My face 
ain't got nothin' to do with it. 
Where's Miss Kew? Go on, find 
her for me." 

She gasped. "You can't speak 
to me like that!" 

I said, "I didn't want to speak 
to you like any way. Let me in." 
I started wishing for Janie. Jahie 
could of moved her. But I had to 
handle it by myself. I wasn't do
* 23 



ing so hot, either. She slammed 
the door before I could so much 
as curse at her. 

So I started kicking on the 
door. For that, shoes are great. 
After a while, she snatched the 
door open agai%so sudden I almost went on my can. She had a 
broom with her. She screamed at 
me, "You get away from here, 
you trash, or I'll call the police!" 
She pushed me and I fell. 

I got up off the porch floor and 
went for her. She stepped back 
and whupped me one with the 
broom as I went past, but anyhow I was inside now. The woman was making little shrieking 
noises and coming for me. I took 
the broom away from her and 
then somebody said, "Miriam!" 
in a voice like a grown goose. 

I froze and the woman went 
into hysterics. "Oh, Miss Kew, 
look out! He'lLkill us all. Get the 
police. Get the — " 

"Miriam!" came the honk, and 
Miriam dried up. 

There at the top of the stairs 
was this prune-faced woman with 
a dress on that had lace on it. 
She looked a lot older than she 
was, maybe because she held her 
mouth so tight. I guess she was 
about thirty-three — thirty-three. 
She had mean eyes and a small 
nose. 

I asked, "Are you Miss Kew?" 
"I am. What is the meaning of 
this invasion?" 



"I got to talk to you, Miss 
Kew." 

"Don't say 'got to.' Stand up 
straight and speak out." 

The maid said, "I'll get the 
police." 

Miss Kew turned on her. 
"There's time enough for that, 
Miriam. Now, you dirty little 
boy, what do you want?" 

"I got to speak to you by yourself," I told her. 

"Don't you let him do it, Miss 
Kew," cried the maid. 

"Be quiet, Miriam. Little boy, 
I told you not to say 'Got to.' 
You may say whatever you have 
to say in front of Miriam." 

"Like hell." They both gasped. 
I said, "Lone told me not to." 

"Miss Kew, are you goin' to 
let him — " 

"Be quiet, Miriam! Young 
man, you will keep a civil — " 
Then her eyes popped up real 
round. "Who did you say . . ." 

"Lone said so." 

"Lone." She stood there on the 
stairs looking at hef hands. Then 
she said, "Miriam, that will be 
all." And you wouldn't know it 
was the same woman, the way 
she said it. 

The maid opened her mouth, 
but Miss Kew stuck out a finger 
that might as well of had a riflesight on the end of it. The maid 
beat it. 

"Hey," I said, "here's your 
broom." I was just going to

"5MAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



throw it, but Miss Kew got to me 
and took it out of my hand. 
• "In there," she said. 

SHE made me go ahead of her 
into a room as big as our 
Swimming hole. It had books all 
over and leather on top of the 
tables, with gold flowers drawn 
into the corners. 

She pointed to a chair. "Sit 
there. No, wait a moment." She 
Went to the fireplace and got a 
newspaper out of a box and 
brought it over and unfolded it 
on the seat of the chair. "Now sit 
down." 

I sat on the paper and she 
dragged up another chair, but 
didn't put no paper on it. 
' "What is it? Where is Lone?" 

"He died," I said. 

She pulled in her breath and 
went white. She stared at me 
until her eyes started to water. 

"You sick?" I asked her. "Go 
ahead, throw up. It'll make you* 
feel better." 

"Dead? Lone is dead?" 

"Yeah. There was a flash flood 
last week and when he went out 
the next night in that big wind, 
he walked under a old oak tree 
that got gullied under by the 
flood. The tree come down on 
him." 

"Came down on him," she 
whispered. "Oh, no . . . it's not 
true." 

"It's true, all right. We planted 



him this morning. We couldnt 
keep him around no more. He 
•was beginning to st — " 

"Stop!" She covered her face 
with her hands. 

"What's the matter?" 

"I'll be all right in a moment," 
she said in a low voice. She went 
and stood in front of the fireplace 
with her back to me. I took off 
one of my shoes while I was 
waiting for her to CQme back. 
But instead she talked from 
where she was. "Are you Lone's 
little boy?" 

"Yeah. He told me to come to 
you." 

"Oh, my dear child!" She came 
running back and I thought for 
a second she was going to pick 
me up or something, but she 
stopped short and wrinkled up 
her nose a little bit. "Wh-what's 
your name?" 

"Gerry," I told her. 

"Well, Gerry, how would you 
like to live with me in this nice 
big house and — and have new 
clean clothes — and everything?" 

"Well, that's the whole idea. 
Lone told me to come to you. He 
said you got more dough than 
you know what to do with, and 
he said you owed him a favor." 

"A favor?" That seemed to 
bother her. 

"Well," I tried to tell her, "he 
said he done something for you 
once and you said some day 
you'd pay him back for it if you 



BABY IS THREE 



ever could. This is it." 

"What did he tell you about 
that?" She'd got her honk back 
by then. 

"Not a damn thing." 

"Please don't use that ward," 
she said, with her eyes closed. 
Then she opened them and nodded her head. "I promised and 
I'll do it. You can live here from 



now on. If — if you want to.** 

"That's got nothin' to do with 
it. Lone told me to." 

"You'll be happy here," she 
said. She gave me an up-anddown. "I'll see to that." 

"Okay. Shall I go get the other 
kids?" 

"Other kids — children?" 

"Yeah. This ain't for just me. 




For all of us — the whole gang." 

"Don't say 'ain't.' " She leaned 
back in her chair, took out a 
silly little handkerchief and dabbed her lips with it, looking at 
me the whole time. "Now tell me 
about these — these other children." v 

"Well, there's Janie, she's elev- j 
en like me. And Bonnie and 




Beanie are eight, they're twins, 
and Baby. Baby is three." 
"Baby is three," she said. 

T SCREAMED. Stern was kneeling beside the couch in a flash, 
holding bis palms against my 
cheeks to hold my head still; I'd 
been whipping it back and forth. 

"Good boy," he said. "You 
found it. You haven't found out 
what it is, but now you know 
wher'e it is." 

"But for sure," I said hoarsely. 
"Got water?" 

He poured me some water out 
of a thermos flask. It was so cold 
it hurt. I lay back and rested, 
like I'd climbed a cliff. I said, "I 
can't take anything like that 
again." 

"You want to call it quits for 
today?" 

"What about you?" 

"I'll go on as long as you want 
me to." 

I thought about it. "I'd like to 
go on, but I don't want no thumping around. Not for a while yet." 

"If you want another of those 
inaccurate analogies," Stern said, 
"psychiatry is like a road map. 
There are always a lot of different 
ways to get from one place to 
another place." 

"I'll go around by the long 
way," I told him. "The eight-lane 
highway. Not that track over th<T 
hill. My clutch is slipping. Where 
do I turn off?" 



BABY IS THREE 



He chuckled. I liked the sound 
of it. "Just past that gravel driveway." 

"I been there. There's a bridge 
washed out." 

"You've been on this whole 
road before," he told me. "Start 
at the other side of the bridge." 

"I never thought ef that. I 
figured I had to do the whole 
thing, every inch." 

"Maybe you won't have to, 
maybe you will, but the bridge 
will be easy to cross when you've 
covered everything else. Maybe 
there's nothing of value on the 
bridge and maybe there is, but 
you can't get near it till you've 
looked everywhere else." 

"Let's go." I was real eager, 
somehow. 

"Mind a suggestion?" 

"No." 

"Just talk," he said. "Don't try 
to get too far into what you're 
saying. That first stretch, when 
you were eight — you really lived 
it. The second one, all about the 
kids, you just talked about. Then, 
the visit when you were eleven, 
you felt that. Now just talk 
again." 

a All right." 

He waited, then said quietly, 
"In the library. You told her 
about the other kids." 

1TOLD her about . . . and 
.then she said . . . and something happened, and I screamed. 



She comforted me and I cussed 
at her. ,* • 

But we're not thinking about 
that now. We're going on. 

In the library. The leather, the 
table, and whether I'm able to do 
with Miss Kew what Lone said. 

What Lone said was, "There's 
a woman lives up on the top of 
the hill in the Heights section, 
name of Kew. She'll have to take 
care of you. You got to get her 
to do that. Do everything she 
tells you, only stay together. 
Don't you ever let any one of 
you get away from the others, 
hear? Aside from that, just you 
keep Miss Kew happy and she'll 
keep you happy. Now you do 
what I say." That's what Lone 
said. Between every word there 
was a link like steel cable, and 
the whole thing made something 
that couldn't be broken. Not by 
me it couldn't. 

Miss Kew said, "Where are 
your sisters and the baby?" 

"I'll bring 'em." 

"Is it near here?" 

"Near enough." She didn't say 
anything to that, so I. got up. "I'll 
be back soon." 

"Wait," she said. "I — really, I 
haven't had time to think. I 
mean — I've got to get things 
ready, you know." 

I said, "You don't need to 
think and you are ready. Solong." 

From the door I heard • her 



M 




 



laying, louder and louder as I 
walked away, "Young man, if 
you're to live in this house, you'll 
learn to be a good deal bettermannered — " and a lot more of 
the same. 

I yelled back at her, "Okay, 
okay!'' and went out. 

The sun was warm and the sky 
was good, and pretty soon I got 
back to Lone's house. The fire 
was out and Baby stunk. Janie 
had knocked over her easel and 
was sitting on the floor by the 
door with her head in her hands. 
Bonnie and Beanie were on a 
stool with their arms around each 
other, pulled up together as close 
as they could get, as if it was cold 
in there, although it wasn't. 

I hit Janie in the arm to snap 
her out of it. She raised her head. 
She had gray eyes — or maybe it 
was more a kind of green — but 
now they had a funny look about 
them, like water in a glass that 
had some milk left in the bottom 
of it. 

I saidf "What's the matter 
around here?" 

"What's the matter with 
what?" she wanted to know. 

"All of yez," I said. 

She said, "We don't give a 
damn, that's all." 

"Well, all right," I said, "but 
ijte got to do what Lone said. 
Come on." 

"No." I looked at the twins. 
They turned their backs on me. 



Janie said, "They're hungry." 

"Well, why not give 'em something?" 

She just shrugged. I sat down. 
What did Lone have to go get 
himself squashed for? 

"We^can't blesh no more," said 
Janie. It seemed to explain everything. 

"Look," I said, "I've got to be 
Lone now." 

Janie thought about that, and 
Baby kicked his feet. Janie looked at him. "You can't," she said. 

"I know where to get the heavy 
food, and the turpentine," I said. 
"I can find that springy moss to 
stuff in the logs, and cut wood, 
and all." 

But I couldn't call Bonnie and 
Beanie from miles away to unlock 
doors. I couldn't just say a word 
to Janie and make her get water 
and blow up the fire and fix the 
battery. I couldn't make us blesh. 

We all stayed like that for a 
long time. Then I heard the bassinet creak. I looked up. Janie 
was staring into it. 

"All right," she said. "Let's go." 

"Who says so?" 

"Baby." 

"Who's running things now?" 
I said, mad. "Me or Baby?" 

"Baby," Janie said. 

I got up and went over to bust 
her one in the mouth, and then I 
stopped. If Baby could make 
them do what Lone wanted, then 
it would get done. If I started

pushing them all around, it 
wouldn't. So I didn't say anything. Janie got up and walked 
out the door. The twins watched 
her go. Then Bonnie disappeared. 
Beanie picked up Bonnie's clothes 
and walked out. I got Baby out 
of the bassinet and draped him 
over my shoulders. 

IT was better when we were all 
outside. It was getting late in 
•the day and the air was warm. 
The twins flitted in and out of 
the trees like a couple of flying 
squirrels, and Janie and I walked 
along like we were going swimming or something. Baby started 
to kick, and Janie looked at him 
a while and got him fed, and he 
was quiet again. 

When we came close to town. 
I wanted to get everybody close 
together, but I was afraid to say 
anything. Baby must of said it 
instead. The twins came back to 
us and Janie gave them their 
clothes and they walked ahead 
of us, good as you please. I don't 
know how Baby did it. They sure 
hated to travel that way. 

We didn't have no trouble except one guy we met on the street 
near Miss Kew's place. He stopped in his tracks and gaped at 
its, and Janie looked at him and 
made his hat go so far down over 
his eyes that he like to pull his 
neck apart getting it back up 
Again. 



What do you know, when we 
got to the house somebody had 
washed off all the dirt I'd put on 
the door. I had one hand on 
Baby's arm and one on his ankle 
and him draped over my neck, 
so I kicked the door and left some 
more, dirt. 

"There's a woman here name 
of Miriam," I told Janie. "She 
says anything, tell her to go to 
hell." 

The door opened and there was 
Miriam. She took one look and 
jumped back six feet. We all 
trailed insidet Miriam got her 
wind and screamed, "Miss Kew! 
Miss Kew!" 

"Go to hell," said Janie, and 
looked'at me. I didn't know what 
to do. It was the first time Janie 
ever did anything I told her to. 

Miss Kew came down the 
stairs. She was wearing a different 
dress, but it was just as stupid 
and had just as much lace. She 
opened her mouth and nothing 
came out, so she just left it open 
until something happened. Finally she said, "Dear gentle Lord 
preserve us!" 

The twins lined up and gawked 
at her. Miriam sidled over to the 
wall and sort of slid along it, 
keeping away from us, until she 
could get to the door and close it. 
She said, "Miss Kew, if those are 
the children you said were going 
to live here, I quit." 

Janie said, "Go to hell."

Just then, Bonnie squatted 
down on the rug. Miriam squawked and jumped at her. She. grabbed hold ©f Bonnie's arm and 
went to snatch her up. Bonnie 
disappeared, leaving Miriam with 
One small dress and the damnedest expression on her face. Beanie 
grinned enough to split her head 
in two and started to wave like 
mad. I looked "where she was 
waving, and there was Bonnie, 
naked as a jaybird, up on the 
banister at the top of the stairs. 

Miss Kew turned around and 
saw .her and sat down plump on 
the steps. Miriam went down, 
too, like she'd been slugged. 
Beanie picked up Bonnie's dress 
and walked up the steps past 
Miss Kew and handed it over. 
Bonnie put it on. Miss Kew sort 
of lolled around and looked up. 
Bonnie and Beanie came back 
down the stairs hand in hand to 
where I was. Then they lined up 
and gaped at Miss Kew. 

"What's the matter with her?" 
Janie asked me. 

"She gets sick every once in a 
While." 

"Let's go back home." 

"No," I told her. 

"jll'ISS KEW grabbed the bannister and pulled herself up. 
SJbe stood there hanging on to it 
|or a while with her eyes closed. 
All of a sudden she stiffened herself. She looked about four inches 



taller. She came marching oyer to 
us. 

"Gerard," she honked. 

I think she was going to say 
something different. But she sort 
of checked herself and pointed. 
"What in heaven's name is that?" 
And she aimed her finger at me. 

I didn't get it right away, so I 
turned around to look behind 
me. "What?" 

"That! That!" 

"Oh!" I said. "That's Baby." 

I slung him down off my back 
and held him up for her to look 
at. She made a sort of moaning 
noise and jumped over and took 
him away from me. She held him 
out in front of her and moaned 
again and called him a poor little 
thing, and ran and put him down 
on a long bench thing with 
cushions under the colored-glass 
window. She bent over him and 
put her knuckle in her mouth and 
bit on it and moaned some more. 
Then she turned to me. 

"How long has he been like 
this?" 

I looked at Jane and she looked 
at me. I said, "He's always been 
like he is." 

She made a sort of cough and 
ran to where Miriam was lying 
flaked on the floor. She slapped 
Miriam's face a couple of times 
back and forth. Miriam sat up 
and looked us over. She closed 
her eyes and shivered and sort of 
climbed up Miss Kew hand over 



BABY IS THREE

hand until she was on her feet. 

"Pull yourself together," said 
Miss Kew between her teeth. 
"Get a basin with some hot water 
and soap. Washcloth. Towels. 
Hurry!" She gave Miriam a big 
push.. Miriam staggeVed and grabbed at the wall, and then ran out. 

Miss Kew went back to Baby 
and hung over him, titch-titching 
with her lips all tight. 

"Don't mess with him," I said. 
"There's nothin' wrong with him. 
.We're hungry." 

She gave me a look like I'd 
punched her. "Don't speak to 
me!" 

"Look," I said." "we don't like 
this any more'n you do. If Lone 
hadn't told us to, we wouldn't 
never have come. We were doing 
all right where we were." ' 

"Don't say 'wouldn't never,' " 
said Miss Kew. She looked at all 
of us, one by one. Then she took 
that silly little hunk of handkerchief and pushed it against her 
mouth. 

"See?" I said to Janie. "All the 
time gettin' sick." 

"Ho-ho," said Bonnie. 

Miss Kew gave her a long look. 
"Gerard," she said in a choked 
sort of voice, "I understood you 
to say that these children were 
your sisters." 
, "Well?" 

She looked at me as if I was 
seal stupid. "We don't have little 
colored girls for sisters, Gerard." 



Janie said, "We do." 

Miss Kew walked up and back, 
real fast. "We have a great deal 
to do," she said, talking to herself. 

Miriam came in with a big oval 
pan and towels and stuff on her 
arm. She put it down on the 
bench thing and Miss Kew stuck 
the back of her hand in the water, 
then picked up Baby and dunked 
him right in it. Baby started to 
kick. - j 

I stepped forward and said 
"Wait a minute. Hold on now. 
What do you think you're 
doing?" 

Janie said, "Shut up, Gerry. He 
says it's all right." 

"All right? She'll drowned 
him." 

"No, she won't. Just shut up." 

WORKING up a froth with 
the soap, Miss Kew smeared it on Baby and turned him 
over a couple of times and scrubbed at his head and like to 
smothered him in a big white 
towel. Miriam stood gawking 
while Miss Kew lashed up a 
dishcloth around him so it corne 
out pants. When she was done, 
you wouldn't of known it was the 
same baby. And by the time Miss 
Kew finished with the job, she 
seemed to have a better hold on 
herself. She was breathing hard 
arid her mouth was even tighter. 
She held out the baby to Miriam. 




 



"Take this poor thing," she 
said, "and put him — " 

But Miriam backed away. "I'm 
sorry, Miss Kew, but I am leaving here and I don't care." 

Miss Kew got her honk out. 
"You can't leave me in a predicament like this! These children 
need help. Can't you see that for 
yourself?" 

Miriam looked me and Janie 
over. She was trembling. "You 
ain't safe. Miss Kew. They ain't, 
just dirty. They're crazy!" 

"They're victims of neglect, 
and probably no worse than you 
or I would be if we'd been neglected. And don't say 'ain't.' 
Gerard!" 

"What?" 

"Don't say — oh, dear, we have 
so. much to do. Gerard, if 
you and your — these other children are going to live here, you 
shall have to make a great many 
changes. You cannot live under 
this roof and behave as you have 
so far. Do you understand that?" 

"Oh, sure. Lone said we was to 
do whatever you say and keep 
you happy." 

"Will you do whatever I 
say?" 

"That's what I just said, isn't 
it?" 

"Gerard, you shall have to 
learn not to speak to me in that 
tone. Now, young man, if I told 
you to do what Miriam says, too, 
would you do it?" 



I said to Jane, "What about 
that?" 

"I'll ask Baby." Janie looked 
at Baby and Baby wobbled his 
hands and drooled some. She 
said, "It's okay." 

Miss Kew said, "Gerard, I 
asked you a question." 

"Keep your pants on," I said. 
"I got to find out, don't I? Yes, 
if that's what you want, we'll 
listen to Miriam, too." 

Miss Kew turned to Miriam. 
"You hear that, Miriam?" 

Miriam looked at Miss Kew 
and at us and shook her head. 
Then she held out her hands a bit 
to Bonnie and Beanie. 

They went right to her. Each 
one took hold of a hand. They 
looted up at her and grinned. 
They were probably planning 
some sort of hellishness, but I 
guess they looked sort of cute. 
Miriam's mouth twitched -and I 
thought for a second she was 
going to look human. She said, 
"All right, Miss Kew." 

Miss Kew walked over and 
handed her the baby and she 
started upstairs with him. Miss 
Kew herded us along after Miriam. We all went upstairs. 

They went to work on us then 
and for three years they never 
stopped. 

THAT was hell," I said to 
Stern. 

"They had their work cut out," 



IAIY IS THREE 



33 



"Yeah, I s'pose they did. So 
did we. Look, we were going to do 
exactly what Lone said. Nothing 
on earth could of stopped us 
from doing it. We were tied and 
bound to doing every last little 
thing Miss Kew said to do. But 
she and Miriam never seemed to 
understand that. I guess they felt 
they had to push every inch of 
the way. All they had to do was 
make us understand what they 
wanted, and we'd of done it. 
That's okay when it's something 
like telling me not to climb into 
bed with Janie. 

"Miss Kew raised holy hell over 
that. You'd of thought I'd robbed 
the Crown Jewels, the way she 
acted. But when it's something 
like, 'You must behave like little 
ladies and gentlemen,' it just 
doesn't mean a thing. And two 
out of three orders she gave us 
were like that. 'Ah-ah!' she'd 
say. 'Language, language !' For 
the longest time I didn't dig that 
at all. I finally asked her what 
the hell she meant, and then she 
finally came out with it. But you 
see what I mean." 

"I certainly do," Stern said. 
"Did it get easier as time went 
on?" 

"We only had real trouble 
twict, once about the twins and 
once about Baby. That one was 
real bad." 

"What happened?" 

"About the twins? Well, when 



we'd been there about a week or 
so we began to notice something 
that sort of stunk. Janie and me, 
I mean. We began to notice 
that we almost never got to see 
Bonnie and Beanie. It was like 
that house was two houses, one 
part for Miss Kew and Jariie and 
me, and the other part for Miriam 
and the twins. I guess we'd have 
noticed it sooner if things hadn't 
been such a hassel at first, getting 
us into new clothes and making 
us sleep all the time at night, and 
all that. But here was the thing: 
We'd all get turned out in the 
side yard to play, and then along 
comes lunch, and the twins got 
herded off to eat with Miriam 
while we ate with Miss Kew. So 
Janie said, 'Why don't the twins 
eat with us?' 

" 'Miriam's taking care of 
them, dear,' Miss Kew says. 

"Janie looked at her with those 
eyes. 'I know that. Let 'em eat 
here and I'll take care of 'em.' 

"Miss Kew's mouth got all 
tight again and she said, 'They're 
little colored girls, Jane. Now 
eat your lunch.' 

"But that didn't explain anything to Jane or me, either. I said, 
'I want 'em to eat with us. Lone 
said we should stay together.' 

" 'But you are together,' she 
says. 'We all live in the same 
house. We all eat the same food. 
Now let us ndt discuss the matter.' 



34 




 



"I looked at Janie and she 
Iboked at me, and she said, 'So 
why can't we all do this livin' 
and eatin' right here?" 

"Miss" Kew put down her fork 
and looked hard. 'I have explained it to you and I have said that 
there .will be no further discussion.' 

"Well, I thought that was real 
nowhere. So I just rocked back 
my head and bellowed, "Bonnie! 
Beanie!" And bing, there they 
were. 

"So all hell broke loose. Miss 
Kew ordered them out and they 
wouldn't go, and Miriam come 
steaming in with their clothes, 
and she couldn't catch them, and 
Miss Kew got to honking at them 
and finally at me. She said this 
w&s too much. Well, maybe she 
had had a hard week, but so had 
we. So Miss Kew ordered us to 
leave. 

"I went and got Baby and started out, and along came Janie 
and the twins. Miss Kew waited 
till we were all out the door and 
next thing you know she ran out 
after us. She passed us and got in 
front of me and made me stop. 
So we all stopped. 

"'Is this how you follow 
Lone's wishes?' she asked. 

*3 told her yes. She said she 
Understood Lone wanted us to 
Stay with her. And I said, 'Yeah, 
but he wanted us to stay together 
more.' 



"She said come back in, we'd 
have a talk. Jane asked Baby and 
Baby said okay, so we went bactt. 
We had a compromise. We didn't 
eat in the dining room no more. 
There was a side porch, a soft 
of verandah thing with glass 
windows, with a door to the dining room and «r*door to the kitchen, and we all ate out there 
after that. Miss Kew ate by herself. 

"But something funny happened because of that whole cock* 
eyed hassel." 

"W/-HAT was that?" Stern 
*» asked me. 

I laughed. "Miriam. She looked 
and sounded like always, but she 
started slipping us cookies between meals. You know, it took 
me years to figure out what all 
that was about. I mean it. From 
what I've learned about people, 
there seems to be two armies 
fightin' about race. One's fightin 
to keep 'em apart, and one's 
fightin' to get 'em together. But 
I don't see why both sides are so 
worried about it! Why don't they 
just forget it?" 

"They can't You see, Gerry, 
it's necessary for people to believe 
they are superior in some fashion. 
You and Lone and the kids— • 
you were a pretty tight uni£ 
Didn't you feel you were a little 
better than all of the rest of the 
world?" 



IAIY IS THREE 



35 



■"Better? How could we be 
better?" 

"Different, then." 

"Well, I suppose so, but we 
didn't think about it. Different, 
yes. Better, no." 

"You're a unique case," Stern 
said. "Now go on and tell me 
about the other trouble you had. 
About Baby." 

"Baby. Yeah. Well, that was a 
couple of months after we moved 
to Miss Kew's. Things were already getting real smooth, even 
then. We'd learned all the 'yes, 
ma'am, no, ma'am' routines by 
then and she'd got us catching up 
with school — regular periods 
morning and afternoon, five days 
a week. Jane had long ago quit 
taking care of Baby, and the 
twins walked to wherever they 
went. That was funny. They 
could pop from one place to another right in front of Miss Kew's 
eyes and she wouldn't believe 
what she saw. She was too upset 
about them suddenly showing up 
bare. They quit doing it and she 
was happy about it. She was 
happy about a lot of things. It 
had been years since she'd seen 
anybody — years. She'd even had 
the meters put outside the house 
so no one would ever have to 
come in. But with us there, she 
began to liven up. She quit wearing those old-Jady dresses and began to look halfway human. She 
ate with us sometimes, even. 



"But one fine day I woke up 
feeling real weird. It was like 
somebody had stolen something 
from me when I was asleep, only 
I didn't know what. I crawled 
out of my window and along the 
ledge into Janie's room, which I 
wasn't supposad to do. She was in 
bed. I went and woke her up. I 
can still see her eyes, the way 
they opened a little slit, still 
asleep, and then popped up wide. 
I didn't have to tell her something was wrong. She knew, and 
she knew what it was. 

" 'Baby's gone!' she said. 

"We didn't care then who woke 
up. We pounded out of her room 
and down the hall and into the 
little room at the end where Baby 
slept. You wouldn't believe it. 
The fancy crib he had, and the 
white chest of drawers, and all 
that mess of rattles and so on, 
they were gone, and there was 
just a writing desk there. I mean 
it was as if Baby had never been 
there at all. 

"We didn't say anything. We 
just spun around and busted into 
Miss Kew's bedroom. I'd never 
been in there but once and Jane 
only a few times. But forbidden 
or not, this was different. Miss 
Kew was in bed, with her hair 
braided. She was wide awake 
before we could get across the 
room. She pushed herself back 
and up until she was sitting 
against the headboard. She gave 




 



the two of us the cold eye. 

" 'What is the meaning of 
this?' she wanted to know. 

"'Where's Baby?' I yelled at 
her. 

" 'Gerard,' she says, 'there is 
no need to shout.' 

"Jane was a real quiet kid, but 
she said, 'You better tell us where 
he is, Miss Kew,' and it would of 
scared you to look at her when 
she said it. 

"So all of a sudden Miss Kew 
took off the stone face and held 
out her hands to us. 'Children,' 
she said, 'I'm sorry. I really am 
sorry. But I've just done what is 
best. I've sent Baby away. He's 
gone to live with some children 
like him. We could never make 
him really happy here. You know 
that.' 

"Jane said, 'He never told us he 
wasn't happy.' 

"Miss Kew brought out a hollow kind of laugh. 'As if he could 
talk, the poor little thing.!' 

" 'You better get him back 
here,' I said. 'You don't know 
What you're fooling with. I told 
you we wasn't ever to break up.' 

"She was getting mad, but she 
held on to herself. 'I '11. try to explain it to you, dear,' she said. 
'You and Jane here and even the 
twins are all normal, healthy 
children and you'll grow up to 
be fine men and women. But 
poor Baby's — different. He's not 
going to grow very much more, 



and he'll never walk and play like 
other children.' 

"'That doesn't matter,' Jane 
said. 'You had no call to send 
him away.' 

"And I said, 'Yeah. You better 
bring him back, but quick.' 

"Then she started to jump 
salty. 'Among the many things I 
have taught you is, I am sure, not 
to dictate to your elders. Now, 
then, you run along and get 
dressed for breakfast, and we'll 
say no more about this.' 

"I told her, nice as I could, 
'Miss Kew, you're going to wish 
you brought him back right now. 
But you're going to bring him 
back soon. Or else.' 

"So then she got up out of 
her bed and ran us out of the 
room." 

1WAS quiet a while, and Stern 
asked, "What happened?" 
"Oh," I said, "she brought him 
back." I laughed suddenly. "I 
guess it's funny now, when you 
come to think of it. Nearly three 
"months of us getting bossed 
around, and her ruling the roost, 
and then all of a sudden we lay 
down the law. We'd tried our 
best to be good according to her 
ideas, but, by God, that time she 
went too far. She got the treatment from the second she slam« 
med her door on us. She had a 
big china pot under her bed, and 
it rose up in the air and smashed

through her dresser mirror. Then 
one of the drawers in the dresser 
slid open and a glove come out of 
it and smacked her face. 

"She went to jump back on the 
bed and a whole section of plaster 
fell off the ceiling onto the bed. 
The water turned on in her little 
bathroom and the plug went in, 
and just about the time it began 
to overflow, all her clothes fell 
off their hooks. She went to run 
out of the room, but the door 
was stuck, and when she yanked 
on the handle it opened real 
quick and she spread out on the 
floor. The door slammed shut 
again and more plaster come 
down on her. Then we went back 
in and stood looking at her. She 
was crying. I hadn't known till 
then that she could. 

" 'You going to get Baby back 
here?' I asked her. 

"She just lay there and cried. 
After a while she looked up at 
us. It was real pathetic. We 
helped her up and got her to a 
chair. She just looked at us for 
a while, and at the mirror, and 
at the busted ceiling, and then 
she whispered, 'What happened? 
What happened?' 

" 'You took Baby away,' I said. 
'That's what.' 

"So she jumped up and said 
real low, real ■ scared, but real 
strong: 'Something struck the 
house. An airplane. Perhaps there 
was an earthquake. We'll talk

iibbut Baby after breakfast." 
"I said, 'Give her more, Jahie.* 
"A big gob of water hit her on 
the face and chest and made her 
nightgown stick to her, which 
was the kind of thing that upset 
her most. Her braids stood 
straight up in the air, more and 
more, till they dragged her standing straight up. She opened her 
mouth to yell and the powder 
puff off the dresser rammed into 
it. She clawed it out. 

" 'What are you doing? What 
are you doing?' she says, crying 
again. 

"Janie just looked at her, and 
put her hands behind her, real 
smug. 'We haven't done anything,' she said. 

"And I said, 'Not yet we 
haven't. You going to get Baby 
back?" 

"And she screamed at us, 'Stop 
it! Stop it! Stop talking about 
that mongoloid idiot! It's no good 
to anyone, not even itself! How 
could I ever make believe it's 
mine?' 

"I said, 'Get rats, Janie.' 

"There was a scuttling sound 
along the baseboard. Miss Kew 
covered her face with her hands 
and sank down on the chair. 'Not 
rats,' she said. 'There are no 
rats here.' Then something 
squeaked and she went all to 
pieces. Did you ever see anyone 
really go to pieces?" 

*'Yes," Stern said. 



"I was about as mad as I 
could get," I said, "but that was 
almost too much for me. Still, 
she shouldn't have sent Baby 
away. It took a couple of hours 
for her to get straightened out 
enough' so she could use the 
phone, but we had Baby back 
before lunch time." I laughed. 

"What's funny?" 

"She never seemed able to 
rightly remember what had happened to her. About three weeks 
later I heard her talking to Miriam about it. She said it was the 
house settling suddenly. She said 
it was a good thing she'd sent 
Baby out for that medical checkup — the poor little thing might 
have been hurt. She really believed it, I think." 

"She probably did. That's fairly common. We don't believe 
anything we don't want to believe." 

"How much of this do you believe?" I asked him suddenly. 

"I told you before — it doesn't 
matter. I don't want to believe 
or disbelieve it." 

"You haven't asked me how 
much of it I believe." 

"I don't have to. You'll make 
up your own mind about that.'' 

"Are you a good psychotherapist?" 

"I think so," he said! "Whom 
did you kill?" 

The question caught me absolutely off guard. "Miss Kew," I

said. Then. I started to cuss and, 
swear. "I didn't mean to tell you 
that." 

"Don't worry about it," he 
said. "What did you do it for?" 

"That's what I came here to 
find out." 

"You must have really hated 
her." 

I started to cry. Fifteen years 
old and crying like that! 

TTE gave me time to get it all 
out. The first part of it came 
out in noises, grunts and squeaks 
that hurt my throat. Much more 
than you'd think came out when 
my nose started to run. And 
finally — words. 

"Do you know where I came 
from? The earliest thing I can 
remember is a punch in the 
: *nouth. I can still see it coming, 
a fist as big as my head. Because 
I was crying. I been afraid to 
cry ever since. I was crying because I was hungry. Cold, maybe. Both. After that, big dormitories, and whoever could steal 
the most got the most. Get the 
hell kicked out of you if you're 
bad, get a big reward if you're 
food. Big reward: they let you 
alone. Try to live like that. Try 
fo live so the biggest, most wonderful thing in the whole damn 
|World is just to have 'em let you 
alone! 

• "So a spell with Lone and the 
kids. - Something /wonderful : you 



belong. It never happened before. 
Two yellow bulbs and a fireplace 
and they light up the world. It's 
all there is and all there ever has 
to be. 

"Theri the big change: clean 
clothes, cooked food, five hours 
a day school; Columbus and 
King Arthur and a 1925 book on 
Civics that explains about septic 
tanks. Over it all a great big 
square -cut lump of ice, and you 
watch it melting and the corners 
curve, and you know it's because 
of you, Miss Kew . . . hell, she 
had too much control over herself ever to slobber over us, but 
it was there, that feeling. Lone 
took care of us because it was 
part of the way he lived. Miss 
Kew took care of us, and none 
of it was the way she lived. It 
was something she wanted to do. 

"She had a weird idea of 
'right' and a wrong idea of 
'wrong,' but she stuck to them, 
tried to make her ideas do us 
good. When she couldn't understand, she figured it was her own 
failure . . . and there was an almighty lot she didn't understand 
and never could. What went 
right was our success. What went 
wrong was her mistake. That last 
year, that was . . . oh, good." 

"So?" 

"So I killed her. Listen," I 
said. I felt I had to talk fast. I 
wasn't short of time, but I had 
to get rid bf it. "I'll tell you all

I know about it. The one day before I killed her. I woke up in the 
morning and the sheets crackly 
clean under me, the sunlight 
coming in through white curtains 
and bright red-and-blue drapes. 
There's a closet full of my clothes 
: — ■mine, you see; I never had anything 'that was really mine before 
— .and downstairs Miriam clinking around with breakfast and 
the twins laughing. Laughing 
with Iter, mind you, not just with 
each other like they always did 
before. 

"In the next room, Janie moving around, singing, and when t 
see her, I know her face will 
shine inside and out. I get up. 
There's hot hot water and the 
toothpaste bites my tongue. The 
cloJhes fit me and I go downstairs and they're all there and 
I'm glad to see them and they're 
glad to see me, and we no sooner 
get set around the table when 
Miss Kew comes down and everyone calls out to her at once. 

"And the morning goes by like 
that, school with a recess, there 
in the big long living room. The 
twins with the ends of their 
tongues stuck out, drawing the 
alphabet instead of writing it, 
and then Jane, when it's time, 
painting a picture, a real picture 
of a cow with trees and a yellow 
fence that goes off into the distance. Here I am lost between the 
two parts of a quadratic equa


tion, and Miss Kew bending close 
to help me, and I smell the sachet 
she has on her clothes. I hold up 
my head to smell it better, and 
far away I hear the -shuffle and 
klunk of filled pots going on the 
stove. back in the kitchen. ^ 

"And the afternoon goes by 
like that, more school and some 
study and boiling out into the 
yard, laughing. The twins chasing each other,, running on their 
two feet to get where they want 
to go; Jane dappling the leaves 
in her picture, trying to get it 
just the way Miss Kew says it 
ought* to be. And Baby, he's got 
a big play-pen. He don't move 
around much any more, he just 
watches and dribbles some, and 
gets packed full of food and kept 
as clean as a new sheet of tinfoil. 

"And supper, and the evening, 
and Miss Kew reading to us, 
changing her voice every time 
someone else talks in the story, 
reading fast and whispery when 
it embarrasses her, but reading 
every word all the same. 

"And I had to go and kill her. 
And that's all." 

YOU haven't said why," Stern 
said. 

"What are you — stupid?" I 
yelled. 

Stern didn't say anything. I 
turned on my belly on the couch 
and propped up my chin in my 
hands and looked at him. You 




 



never could tell what was going 
On with him, but I got the idea 
that he was puzzled. 

"I said why," I told him. 

"Not to me." 

I suddenly understood that I 
was asking too much of him. I 
said slowly, "We all woke up at 
the same time. We all did what 
somebody else wanted. We lived 
through a day someone else's 
way, thinking someone else's 
thoughts, saying other people's 
words. Jane painted someone 
else's pictures, Baby didn't talk 
to anyone, and we were all happy 
with it. Now do you see?" 

"Not yet." 

"God!" I said. I thought for a 
while. "We didn't blesh." 

"Blesh? Oh. But you didn't 
after Lone died, either." 

"That was different. That was 
like a car running out of gas, but 
the car's there — there's nothing 
wrong with it. It's just waiting. 
But after Miss Kew got done 
with us, the car was taken all to 
pieces, see?" 

It was his turn to think a 
While. Finally he said, "The mind 
makes us do funny things. Some 
of them seem completely reasonless, wrong, insane. But the cornerstone of the work we're doing 
it this: there's a chain of solid, 
unassailable logic in the things 
We do. Dig deep enough and you 
find cause and effect as clearly 
Iftv this field a*s you do in any 

1ABY IS THREE 



other. I said logic, mind; I didn't 
say 'correctness.' or 'rightness' or 
'justice' or anything of the sort. 
Logic and truth are two very 
different things, but they often 
look the same to the mind that's 
performing the logic. 

"When that "mind is submerged, working at cross-pm> 
poses with the surface mind, then 
you're all confused. Now in your 
case, I can see the thing you're 
pointing at — that in order to preserve or to rebuild that peculiar 
bond between you kids, you had 
to get rid of Miss Kew. But I 
don't see the logic. I don't see 
that regaining that 'Meshing' was 
worth destroying this new-found 
security which you admit was 
enjoyable." 

I said, desperately, "Maybe it 
wasn't worth destroying it." 

Stern leaned forward and 
pointed his pipe at me. "It was 
because it made you do what you 
did. After the fact, maybe things 
look different. But, when you 
were moved to do it, the important thing was to destroy Miss 
Kew and regain this thing you'd 
had before. I don't see why and 
neither do you." 

"How are we going to find 
out?" 

"Well, let's get right to the 
most unpleasant part, if you're 
up to it." 

I lay down. "I'm ready." 

"All right. Tell me everything

that happened just before you 
killed her." 

1 FUMBLED through that last 
day, trying to taste the food, 
hear the voices. A thing came 
and went and came again : it was 
the crisp feeling of the sheets. I 
thrust it away because it was at 
the beginning of that day, but it 
came back again, and I realized 
it was at the end, instead. 

I said, "What I just told you, 
all that about the children doing 
things other people's way instead 
of their own, and Baby not talking, and everyone happy about it, 
and finally that I had to kill Miss 
Ke'w. It took a long time to get 
to that, and a long time to start 
doing it. I guess I lay in bed and 
thought for four hours before I 
got up again. It was dark and 
quiet. I went - out of the room 
and down the hall and into Miss 
Kew's bedroom and killed her." 
"How?" 

"That's all there is!" I shouted, 
as loud as I could. Then I quieted down. "It was awful dark . . . 
it still is. I don't know. I don't 
want to know. She did love us. 
I know she did. But I had to kill 
her." 

"All right, all right," Stern 
said. "I guess there's no need to 
get too gruesome about this. 
You're—" 

"What?" 

"You're quite strong for your 



age, aren't you, Gerard?" 

"i guess so. Strong enough, 
anyway." 

"Yes," he said. 

'T still don't see that logic you 
were talking about." I began to 
hammer on the couch with my 
fist, "hard, once for each word: 
"Why — did — I — have — to 
— go — and — do — that?" 

"Cut that out," he said. "You'll 
hurt yourself." 

"I ought to get hurt," I said. 
"Ah?" said Stern. 
I got up and went to the desk 
and got some water. "What am I 
going to do?" 

"Tell me what you did after 
you killed her, right up until the 
time you came here." 

"Not much," I said. "It was 
only last night. I went back to 
my room, sort of numb. I put 
all my clothes on except my 
shoes. I carried them. I went out. 
Walked a long time, trying to 
think, went to the post office 
when it opened. Miss Kew used 
to let me go for the mail sometimes. Found this check waiting 
for me for the contest. Cashed it 
at the bank, opened an account, 
took eleven hundred bucks. Got 
the idea of getting some help 
from a psychiatrist, spent most 
of the day looking for one, came 
here. That's all." 

"Didn't you have any trouble 
cashing the check?" 

"I never have any trouble

making people do what I want 
them to do." 

He gave a surprised grunt. 

"I know what you're thinking 
—I couldn't make Miss Kew do 
what I wanted." 

"That's part of it," he admitted. 

"If I had of done that," I told 
him, "she wouldn't of been Miss 
Kew any more. Now the banker 
—all I made him do was be a 
banker." 

I LOOKED at him and suddenly realized why he fooled 
With that pipe all the time. It 
Was so he could look down at it 
•nd you wouldn't be able to see 
Bis eyes-. 

"You killed her," he said— and 
1 knew he was changing the subfeet — "and destroyed something 
'that was valuable to you. It must 
futve been less valuable to you 
Khan the chance to rebuild this 
thing you used to have with the 
Jither kids. And you're not sure 
MNf the value of that." He looked 
lip. "Does that describe your 
main trouble?" 
1 "Just about." 

| "You know the single thing 
■tat makes people kill?" When 
■ didn't answer, he said, "Survival. To save the self or something which identifies with the 
■tlf. And in this case that doesn't 
ppply, because your setup with 
Miss Kew had far more survival 



value for you, singly and as a 
group, than the other." 

"So maybe I just-didn't have 
a good enough reason to kill her." 

"You had, because you did it. 
We just haven't located it yet. 
I mean we have the reason, but 
we don't know why it was important enough. The answer is 
somewhere in you." 

"Where?" 

He got up and walked some. 
"We have a pretty consecutive 
life-story here. There's fantasy 
mixed with the fact, of course, 
and there are areas in which we 
have no detailed information, but 
we have a beginning and a middle and an end. Now, I can't say 
for sure, but the answer may be 
in that bridge you refused to 
cross a while back. Remember?" 

I remembered, all right. I said, 
"Why that? Why can't we try 
something else?" 

He quietly pointed out, "Because you just said it. Why are 
you shying away from it?" 

"Don't go making big ones out 
of little ones," I said. Sometimes 
the guy annoyed me. "That bothers me. I don't know why, but it 
does." 

"Something's lying hidden in 
there, and you're bothering if so 
it's fighting back. Anything that 
fights to stay concealed is very 
possibly the thing we're after. 
Your trouble is concealed, isn't 
it?"

"Well, yes," I said, and I felt 
that sickness and faintness again, 
and again I pushed it away. Suddenly I wasn't going to be stopped any more. "Let's go get it." 
I lay down. 

He let me watch the ceiling and 
listen to silence for a while, and 
then he said, "You're in the library. You've just met Miss Kew. 
She's talking to you; you're telling her about the children." 

I lay very still. Nothing happened. Yes, it did; I got tense 
inside, all over, from the bones 
out, more and more. When it got 
as bad as it could, still nothing 
happened. 

I heard him get up and cross 
the room to the desk. He fumbled 
there for a while; things clicked 
and hummed. Suddenly I heard 
my own voice: 

"Well, there's Jane, she's eleven like me. And Bonnie and 
Beanie are eight, they're twins, 
and Baby. Baby is three." 

And the sound of my own 
scream — 

And nothingness. 

SPUTTERING up out of the 
darkness, I came flailing out 
with my fists. Strong hands 
caught my wrists. -They didn't 
check my arms; they just grabbed and rode. I opened my eyes. 
I was soaking wet. The thermos 
lay on its side on the rug. Stern 
was crouched beside me, holding 



my wrists. I quit struggling. 

"What happened?" 

He let me go and stood back 
watchfully. "Lord," he said, 
"what a charge.'" 

I held my head and moaned. 
He threw me a hand-towel and 
I used it. "What hit me?" 

"I've had you on tape the i 
whole time," he explained. "When , 
you wouldn't get into that recol- S 
lection, I tried to nudge you into | 
it by using your own voice as ' 
you recounted it before. It works 
wonders sometimes." 

"It worked wonders this time," 
I growled. "I think I blew a fuse." 

"In effect, you did. You were 
on the trembling verge of going 
into the thing you don't want to 
remember, and you let yourself j 
go unconscious rather than do it." 

"What are you so pleased 
about?" 

"Last-ditch defense," he said 
tersely. "We've got it now. Just | 
one more try." 

"Now hold on. The last-ditch 
defense is that I drop dead." 

"You won't. You've contained 
this episode in your subconscious 
mind for a long time and it hasn't 
hurt you." 

"Hasn't it?" 

"Not in terms of killing you." 
"How do you know it won't 
when we drag it out?" 
"You'll see." 

I looked up at him sideways. 
Somehow he struck me as know


i 46 




 



ing what he was doing. 

"You know a lot more about 
yourself now than you did at the 
time," he explained softly. "You 
Can apply insight. You can evaluate it as it comes up. Maybe not 
completely, but enough to protect yourself. Don't worry. Trust 
me. I can stop it if it gets too 
tad. Now just relax. Look at the 
Ceiling. Be aware of your toes. 
Don't look at your toes. Look 
■traight up. Your toes, your big 
toes. Don't move your toes, but 
leel them. Count outward from 
jrour big toes, one count for each 

tloe. One, two, three. Feel that 
Ihird toe. Feel the toe, feel it,

™*he toe next to it on both sides 
its limp. So limp because your 
«s are limp, all of your toes are

"What are you doing?" I 
shouted at him. 

He said in the same silky voice, 
''You trust me and so do your 
■toes trust me. They're all limp 
because you trust me. You — " 

"You're trying to hypnotize 
me. I'm not going to let you do 
that." 

"You're going to hypnotize 
yourself. You do everything yourself. I just point the way. I point 
your toes to the path. Just point 
your toes. No one can make you 
go anywhere you don't want to 
go* but you want to go where 
your toes are pointed where your 



toes are limp where your . . .** 

On and on and on. And where 
was the dangling gold ornament, 
the light in the eyes, the mystic 
passes? He wasn't even sitting 
where I could see him. Where 
was the talk about how sleepy I 
was supposed to be? Well, he 
knew I wasn't sleepy and didn't 
want to be sleepy. I just wanted 
to be toes. I just wanted to be 
limp, just a limp toe. No brains 
in a toe, a toe to go, go, go eleven 
times, eleven, I'm eleven , . . 

I split in two, and it was all 
right, the part that watched the 
part that went back to the library, and Miss Kew leaning toward me, but not too near, me 
with the newspaper crackling 
under me on the library chair, 
me with one shoe off and my limp 
toes dangling . . . and I felt a 
mild surprise at this. For this was 
hypndsis» but I was quite conscious? quite altogether there on 
the couch with Stern droning 
away at me, quite able to roll 
over and sit up and talk to him 
and walk out if I wanted to, but 
I just didn't want to. Oh, if this 
was what hypnosis was like, I 
was all for it. I'd work at this. 
This was all right. 

There on the table I'm able to 
see that the gold will unfold on 
the leather, and whether I'm able 
to stay by the table with you, 
with Miss Kew, with Miss 
Kew ...

*. . . and Bonnie and Beanie 
are eight, they're twins, and 
Baby. Baby is three." 

"Baby is three," she said. 

There was a pressure, a stretching apart, and a ... a breakage. 
And with a tearing agony and a 
burst of triumph that drowned 
the pain, it was done. 

And this is what was inside. 
All 442 one flash, but all this. 

BABY is three? My baby 
would be three if there were 
a baby, which there never was. . . 

Lone, I'm open to you. Open, 
is this open enough? 

His irises like wheels. I'm sure 
they spin, but I never catch them 
at it. The probe that passes invisibly from his brain, through 
his eyes, into mine. Does he 
know what it means to me? Does 
he care? He doesn't care, he 
doesn't know; he empties me and 
I fill as he directs me to; he 
drinks and waits and drinks again 
and never looks at the cup. 

•When I saw him first, I was 
dancing in the wind, in the wood, 
in the wild, and I spun about and 
he stood there in the leafy shadows, watching me. I hated him 
for it. It was not my wood, not 
my gold-spangled fern-tangled 
glen. But it was my dancing that 
he took, freezing it forever by 
being there." I hated him for it, 
hated the way he looked, the way 
he stood, ankle -deep in the kind 



wet ferns, looking like a "tree with 
roots for feet and clothes the 
color of earth. As I stopped he 
moved, and then he was just a 
man, a great ape-shouldered, 
dirty animal of a man, and all 
my hate was fear suddenly and I 
was just as frozen. 

He knew what he had done 
and he didn't care. Dancing . . « 
never to dance again, because 
never would I know the woods 
were free of eyes, free of tall, 
uncaring, dirty animal men. Summer days with the clothes chok* 
ing me, winter nights with the 
precious decencies round . and 
about me like a shroud, and 
never to dance again, never to 
remember dancing without remembering the shock of knowing 
he had seen me. How I hated 
him! Oh, how I hated him! 

To dance alone where no one 
knew, that was the single thing 
I hid to myself when I was 
known as Miss Kew, that Victorian, older than her years, later 
than her time; correct and 
starched, lace and linen and 
lonely. Now indeed I would be 
all they said, through and 
through, forever and ever, because he had robbed me of the 
one thing I dared to keep secret. 

He Came out 'into the sun and 
walked to me, holding his great 
head a little on one side. I stood 
where I was, frozen inwardly and 
outwardly and altogether by the 



48 




 



iffcre of anger and the layer of 
fear. My arm was still out, my 
Waist still bent from my dance, 
and when he stopped, I breathed 
again because by then I had to. 

He said, "You read books?" 

I couldn't bear to have him 
near me, but I couldn't move. He 
put out his hard hand and touched my jaw, turned my head up 
until I had to look into his face. 
I cringed away from him, but 
my face would not leave his 
hand, though he was not holding 
it, just lifting it. "You got to 
read some books for me. I got 
no time to find them." 

I asked him, "Who are you?" 

"Lone," he said. "You going to 
read books for me?" 

"No. Let me go, let me go!" 

He laughed at me. He wasn't 
holding me. 

"What books?" I cried. 

HE thumped my face, not very 
hard. It made me look up a 
bit more. He dropped his hand 
away. His eyes, the irises were 
going to spin . . . 

"Open up in there," he said. 
-"Open way up and let me see." 

There were books in my head, 
and he was looking at the titles 
* . . he was not looking at the 
titles, for he couldn't read. He 
was looking at what I knew of 
the books. I suddenly felt terribly useless, because I had only 
a fraction of what he wanted. 



"What's that?" he barked. 

I knew what he meant. He'd 
gotten it from inside my head. I 
didn't know it was in there, even, 
but he found it. 

"Telekinesis," I said. 

"How is it done?" 

"Nobody knows if it can be 
done. Moving physical objects 
with the mind!" 

"It can be done," he said. "This 
one?" 

"Teleportation. That's the 
same thing — well, almost. Moving your own body with mind 
power." 

"Yeah, yeah, I see it," he said 
gruffly. 

"Molecular interpenetration. 
Telepathy and clairvoyance. I 
don't know anything about them. 
I think they're silly." 

"Read about 'em. It don't matter if you understand or not. 
What's this?" 

It was there in my brain, on 
my lips. "Gesialt." 

"What's that?" 

"Group. Like a cure for a lot 
of diseases with one kind ; of 
treatment. Like a lot of thoughts 
expressed in one phrase. The 
whole is greater than the sum of 
the parts." 

"Read about that, too. Read a 
whole lot about that. That's the 
most you got to read about. 
That's important." 

He turned away, and when his 
eyes came away from mine it was

like something breaking, so that 
I staggered and fell to one knee. 
He went off into the woods without looking back. I got my things 
and ran home. There was anger, 
and it struck me like a storm. 
There was fear, and it struck me 
like a wind. I knew I would read 
the books, I knew I would come 
back, I knew I would never 
dance again. 

So I read the books and I came 
back. Sometimes it was every day 
for three or four days, and sometimes, because I couldn't find a 
certain book, I might not come 
back for ten. He was always there 
in the little glen, waiting, standing in the shadows, and he took 
what he wanted of the books and 
nothing of me. He never mentioned the next meeting. If he 
came there every day to wait for 
me, or if he only came when I 
did, I have no way of knowing. 

He made me read books that 
contained nothing for me, books 
on evolution, on social and cultural organization, on mythology, 
and ever so much on symbiosis. 
What I had with him were not 
conversations; sometimes nothing audible would pass between 
us but his grunt of surprise or 
small, short hum of interest. 

He tore the books out of me the 
Way he would tear berries from 
a bush, all at once; hesmelled of 
sweat and earth and the green 
Juices his heavy body crushed 



when he moved through the 
wood. 

If he learned anything from 
the books, it made no difference 
in him. 

' ■ ''HERE came a day when he 
sat by me and puzzled something out. 

He said, "What book has something like this?" Then he waited 
for a long time, thinking. "The 
way a termite can't digest wood, 
you know, and microbes in the 
termite's belly can, and what the 
termite eats is what the microbe 
leaves behind. What's that?" 

"Symbiosis," I remembered. I 
remembered the words. Lone tore 
the content from words and threw 
the words away. "Two kinds pf 
life depending upon one another 
for existence." 

"Yeah. Well, is there a book 
about four-five kinds doing 
that?" 

"I don't know." 

Then he asked, "What about 
this? You got a radio station, you 
got four-five receivers, each receiver is fixed up to make something different happen, like one 
digs and one flies and one makes 
noise, but each one takes orders 
from the one place. And each one 
has its own power and its own 
thing to do, but they are all apart. 
Now: is there life like that, instead of radio?" 

"Where each organism is a part

itime, looking off to the blue-onjblue line of the hilly horizon. 
Then he drove those about-to•pin irises at me and searched. 
[■■;."■ "You learn, but you don't

rat the hills. 

WV "This all happens with hu

happens piece by piece right

"I'm one," he finished suddenly. Then he sat still for so long, 
I thought he had forgotten me. 

"Lone," I said, "what do you 
do here in the woods?" 

"I wait," he said. "I ain't finished yet." He looked at my eyes 
and snorted in irritation. "I don't 
mean 'finished' like you're thinking. I mean I ain't — completed

that is me when I'm finished." 

"I don't know of such a book. 
Can you tell me more? Maybe 
if you could, I'd think of the 
right book or a place to find it." 

He broke a stick between his 
huge . hands, put the two pieces

4jether with one strong twist. 

"All I know is I got to do what 
I'm doing like a bird's got*to nest 
when it's time< And I know that 
when I'm done I won't be anything to brag about. I'll be like a 
body stronger and faster than 
anything there ever was, without 
the right kind of head on it. But 
maybe that's because I'm one of 
the first. That picture you had, 
the caveman . . ." 

"Neanderthal." 

"Yeah. Come to think of it, he 
was no great shakes. An early try 
at something new. That's what 
I'm going to be. But maybe the 
right kind of head'll come along 
after I'm all organized. Then it'll 
be something." 

He grunted with satisfaction 
and went* away. 

T TRIED, for days I tried, but 
-■- I couldn't find what he wanted. I found' a magazine which 
stated that the next important 
evolutionary step in man would 
be a psychic rather than a physical direction, but it said nothing 
about a — shall I call it a gestalt 
organism? There was something 
about slime molds, but they seem 
to be more a hive activity of 
amoebae than even a symbiosis. 

To my own unscientific, personally uninterested mind, there 
was nothing like what he wanted 
except possibly a band marching 
together, everyone playing differ


ent kinds of instruments with different techniques and different 
notes, to make a single thing 
move along together. But he 
hadn't meant anything like that. 

So I went back to him in the 
cool of an early fall evening, and 
he took what little I had in my 
eyes, and turned from me angrily 
with a gross word I shall not permit myself to remember. • 

"You can't find it," he told me. 
"Don't come back." 

He got up and went to a tattered birch and leaned against it, 
looking out and down into the 
wind -tossed crackling shadows. I 
think he had forgotten me already. I know he leaped like a 
frightened animal when 1 spoke 
to him from so near. He must 
have been completely immersed 
in whatever strange thoughts he 
was having, for I'm sure he 
didn't hear me coming. 

I said "Lone, don't blame me 
for not finding it. I tried." 

He controlled his startlement 
and brought those eyes down to 
me. "Blame? Who's blamiri* anybody?" 

"I failed you," I told him, "and 
you're angry." 

He looked at me so long I became uncomfortable. 

"I don't know what you're 
talkin' about," he said. 

I wouldn't let him turn away 
from me. He would have. He 
would have left me forever with

L t another thought; he didn't 
etaref It wasn't cruelty or 
thoughtlessness as I have been 
taught to know those things. He 
was as uncaring as a cat is of the 
bursting of a tulip bud. 

I took him by the upper arms 
and shook him, it was like trying 
to shake the front of my house. 
"You can know!" I screamed at 
him. "You know what I read. 
You must know what I think!" 
He shook his head. 
"I'm a person, a woman," I 
raved at him. "You've used me 
and used me and you've given 
me nothing. You've made me 
break a lifetime of habits — reading until all hours, coming to you 
in the rain and on Sunday — you 
don't talk to me, you don't look 
at me, you don't know anything 
about me and you don't care. 
You put some sort of a spell on 
me that I couldn't break. And 
when you're finished, you say, 
'Don't come back.' " 

"Do I have to give something 
back because I took something?" 
"People do." 

He gave that short, interested 
hum. "What do you want me to 
give you? I ain't got anything." 

I moved away from him. I 
felt ... I don't know what I felt. 
. After a time I said, "I don't 
• know." 

He shrugged and turned. I 
'fairly leaped at him, dragging 
him back. "I want you to — " 



"Well, damn it, what??' 

I couldn't look at him; I could 
hardly speak. "I don't know. 
There's something, but I don't 
know what it is. It's something 
that — I couldn't say if I knew 
it." When he began to shake his 
head, I took his arms again. 
"You've read the books out of 
me; can't you read the • . - the 
me out of me?" „ 

"I ain't never tried." He held 
my face up, and stepped close. 
"Here," he said. 

HIS eyes projected their 
strange probe at me and' I 
screamed. I tried to twist away. 
I hadn't wanted this, I was sure 
I hadn't. I struggled terribly. I ( 
think he lifted me right off the 
ground with his big hands. He 
held me until he was finished, 
and then let me drop. I huddled 
to the ground, sobbing. He sat 
down beside me. He didn't try 
to touch me. He didn't try to go 
away. I quieted at last and 
crouched there, waiting. 

He said, "I ain't going to do 
much of that no more." 

I sat up and tucked my skirt 
close around me and laid my 
cheek on my updrawn knees so I 
could see his face. "What happened?" 

He cursed. "Damn mishmash 
inside you. Thirty-three years eM 
— what you want to live like that 
for?"

"I live very comfortably," I 
said with some pique. 

"Yeah," he said. "All by yourself for ten years now 'cept for 
someone to do your work. Nobody else." 

"Men are animals, and women ..." 

"You really hate women. They 
all know something you don't." 

"I don't want to know. I'm 
quite happy the way I am. 

"Hell you are." 

I said nothing to that. I despise 
that kind of language. 

"Two things you want from 
me. Neither makes no sense." He 
looked at me with the first real 
expression I have ever seen in his 
face: a profound wonderment. 
"You want to know all about me, 
where I came from, how I got to 
be what I am." 

"Yes, I do want that. What's 
the other thing I want that you 
know and I don't?" 
■ "I was born some place' and 
growed like a weed somehow," 
he said, 'ignoring me. "Folks who 
didn't give even enough of a 
damn to try the orphanage routine. I lived with some other folks 
for a while, tried school, didn't 
like it. Too small a town for them 
special schools for my kind, retarded, y'know. So I just ran 
loose, sort of in training to be the 
village idiot. I' da made it if I'd 
stayed there, but I took to the 
woods instead." 



"Why?" 

He wondered why, and finally 
said, "I guess because the way 
people lived didn't make no sense 
to me. I saw enough up and down, 
back and forth, to know that they 
live a lot of different ways, but 
none of 'em was for me. Out here 
I can grow like I want." 

"How is that?" I asked over 
one of those vast distances that 
built and receded between him 
and me so constantly. 

"What I wanted to get from 
your books." 

"You never told me." 

TT7 , OjR the second time he said, 
"You learn, but-' you don't 
think. There's a kind of- := well, 
person. It's all made of separate 
parts, but it's all one person. It 
has like hands, it has like legs, 
it has like a talking mouth, and 
it has like a brain. That's me, a 
brain for that person. Damn 
feeble, too, but the best I know 
of.", 

"You're mad." 

"No, I ain't," he said, unoffended and completely certain. "I 
already got the part that's like 
hands. I can move 'em anywhere 
and they do what I want, though 
they're too young yet to do much 
good. I got the part, that talks, 
that one's real good." 

"I don't think you talk very 
well at all," I said. I cannot stand 
incorrect English.

s* My own head was swimming.

He considered me gravely. 
•What made you start growing 
ir in your armpits?" he asked 
jdttt-' "You don't figure a thing 
ke that. It just happens." 

What is that ... that thing 
' ou do when you 1 look in my

"You Want a name for it? I

do it. I know I can get anyone

I said in a choked voice, "I

•d want to forget "You'll hate

ful that you'll be glad to do it. 
But you'll forget, all right, everything but a sort of . . . feeling. 

And my name, maybe." 

I don't know what moved me 
to ask him, but I did, forlornly. 
"And no one will ever know about 
you and me?" 

"Can't," he said. "Unless . . . 
well, unless it was the head of 
the animal, like me, or a better 
one." He heaved himself up. . 

"Oh, wait, wait!" I cried. He 
mustn't go yet, he mustn't. He 
was a tall, dirty beast of a man, 
yet he had enthralled me in some 
dreadful way. "You haven't given 
me the other ... whatever it 
was." 

"Oh," he said. "Yeah, that." 

He moved like a flash. There 
was a pressure, a stretching apart, 
and a ... a breakage. And with 
a tearing agony and a burst of 
triumph that drowned the pain, 
it was done. 

1CAME up out of it, through 
two distinct levels : 
I am eleven, breathless from 
shock from a transferred agony 
of that incredible entrance into 
the ego of another. And: 

I am fifteen, lying on the couch 
while Stern drones on, ". . . quietly, quietly limp, your ankles and 
legs as limp as your toes, your 
belly goes soft, the back of your 
neck is as limp as your belly, it's 
quiet and easy and all gone soft 



A BY IS THREE 



and . limper than limp , . . " 

• I sat up and swung my legs to 
the floor. "Okay," I said. 

Stern looked a little annoyed. 
"This is going to work," he said, 
"but it can only work if you cooperate. Just lie — " 

"It did work," I said. 

* "What?" 

"The whole thing. A to Z." I 
snapped my fingers. "Like that." 

He looked at me piercingly. 
"What do you mean?" 

"It was right there, where you 
said. In the library. When I was 
eleven. When she said, 'Baby is 
three.' It knocked loose something that had been boiling 
around in her for three years, and 
it all came blasting out. I got it, 
full force; just a kid, no warning, 
no defenses. It had such a — a 
pain in it, like I never knew could 
be." 

"Go on," said Stern. ■ 

"That's really all. I mean that's 
not what was in it; it's what it 
did to me. What it was, a sort of 
hunk of her own self. A whole lot 
of things that happened over 
about four months, every bit of 
it. She knew Lone." 

"You mean a whole series of 
episodes?" 

"That's it." 

"You g<?t a series all at once? 
In a split second?" 

"That's right. Look, for that 
split second I was her, don't you 
see? I was her, everything she'd 



ever done, everything she'd ever 
thought and heard and felt. Everything, everything, all in the 
right order if I wanted to bring 
it out like that. Any part of it 
if I wanted it by itself. If I'm 
going to tell you about what I 
had for lunch, do I have to tell 
you everything else I've ever 
done since I was born? No. I tell 
you I was her, and then and forever after I can remember anything she could remember up to 
that point. In just that one 
flash." 

"A gestalt," he murmured. 

"Aha!" I said, and thought 
about that. I thought about a 
whole lot of things. I put them 
aside for a moment and said, 
"Why didn't I know all this before?" 

"You had a powerful block 
against recalling it." 

1GOT up excitedly. "I don't 
see why. I don't see that at 
all." 

"Just natural revulsion," he 
guessed. "How about this? You 
had a distaste for assuming a female ego, even for a second." 

"You told me yourself, right 
at the beginning, that I didn't 
have that kind of a problem." 

"Well, how does this sound to 
you? You say you felt pain in 
that episode. So — you wouldn't 
go back into it for fear of reexperiencing the pain." 




 



• ? "Let me think, let me think. 
Veah, yeah, that's part of it — that 
thing of going into someone's 
mind. She opened up to me because I reminded her of Lone. I 
went in. I wasn't ready; I'd never 
done it before, except maybe a 
little, against resistance. I went 
all the way in and it was too 
much; it frightened me away 
from trying it for years. And 
there it lay, wrapped up, locked 
away. But as I grew older, the 
power to do that with my mind 
got stronger and stronger, and 
still I was afraid to use it. And 
the more I grew, the more I felt, 
down deep, that Miss Kew had 
to be killed before she killed the 
,, . . what I am. My God!" I 
Shouted. "Do you know what I 
am?" 

"No," he said. "Like to tell me 
about it?" 

"I'd like to," I said. "Oh, yes, 
I'd like that." 

. He had that professional openminded expression on his face, 
not believing or disbelieving, just 
taking it all in. I had to tell him, 
and I suddenly realized that I 
didn't have enough words. I 
knew the things, but not the 
names for them. 

Lone took the meanings , and 
, threw the words away. 

Further back : " You read 
books. Read books for me." 

The look of his eyes. That — 
"opening up" thing. 



I went over to Stern. He looked up at me. I bent close. First 
he was startled, then he controlled it, then he came even closer to 
me. 

"My God," he murmured. "I 
didn't look at those eyes before. 
I could have sworn those irises 
spun like wheels . . ." 

STERN read books. He'd read 
more books than I ever imagined had been written. I slipped 
in there, looking for what I 
wanted. 

I can't say exactly what it was 
like. It was like walking in a tunnel, and in this tunnel, all over 
the roof and walls, wooden arms 
stuck out at you, like the thing 
at the carnival, the merry-goround, the thing you snatch the 
brass rings from. There's a brass 
ring on the end of each of these 
arms, and you can take any one 
of them you want to. 

Now imagine you make up 
your mind which rings you want, 
and the arms hold only those. 
Now. picture yourself with a thou sand hands to grab the rings off 
with. Now just suppose the tunnel is a zillion miles long, and 
you can go from one end of it to 
the other, grabbing rings, in just 
the time it takes you to blink 
once. Well, it was like that, only 
easier. 

It was easier for me to do than 
it had been for Lone.

STRAIGHTENING up, I got 
away from Stern. He looked 
sick and frightened. 
"It's all right," I said. 
"What did you do to me?" 
"I needed some words. Come 
on, come on. Get professional." 

I had to admire him. He put 
his pipe in his pocket and gouged 
the tips of his fingers hard against 
his forehead and cheeks. Then 
he sat up and he was okay again. 

"I know," I said. "That's how 
Miss Kew felt when Lone did it 
to her." 

"What are you?" 
"I'll tell you. I'm the central 
ganglion of a complex organism 
which is composed of Baby, a 
computer; Bonnie and Beanie, 
teleports; Jane, telekineticist ; 
and myself, telepath and central 
control. There isn't a single thing 
about any of us that hasn't been 
documented: the teleportation of 
the Yogi, the telekinetics of some 
gamblers, the idio-savant mathematicians, and most of all, the 
so-called poltergeist, the moving 
about of household goods 
through the instrumentation of a 
young girl. Only in this case 
every one of my parts delivers at 
peak performance. 

"Lone organized it, or it formed 
around him; it doesn't matter 
which. I replaced Lone, but I 
Was too underdeveloped when he 
died, and on top of that I got an 
Occlusion from that blast from 



Miss Kew„ To that extent you 
were right when you said the 
blast made me subconsciously 
afraid to discover what . was in 
it. But there was another good 
reason for my not being able to 
get in under that 'Baby is three' 
barrier. 

"We rah into the problem of 
what it was I valued more than 
the security Miss Kew gave us. 
Can't you see now what it was? 
My gestalt organism was at the 
point of death from that security. 
I figured she had to be killed or 
it — / — would be. Oh, the parts 
would live on: two little colored 
girls with a speech impediment, 
one introspective girl with an artistic bent, one mongoloid idiot, 
and me — ninety per cent shortcircuited potentials and ten per 
cent juvenile delinquent." I 
laughed. "Sure, she had to be 
killed. It was self-preservation 
for the gestalt." 

Stern bobbled around with his 
mouth and finally got out: "I 
don't—" 

"You don't need to," I laughed. 
"This is wonderful. You're fine, 
hey, fine. Now I want to tell you 
this, because you can appreciate 
a fine point in your specialty. 
You talk about occlusions! I 
couldn't get past the 'Baby is 
three' thing because in it lay the 
clues to what I really am. I 
couldn't find that out because I 
was afraid to remember that I

failed in the thing I had to 
to save the gestalt. Ain't that 
purty?" 

"Failed? Failed how?" 
"Look. I came to love Miss 
Kew, and I'd never loved anything before. Yet I had reason to 
kill her. She had to be killed; I 
couldn't kill her. What does a human mind do when presented 
with imperative, mutually exclu»ive alternatives?" 

"It — it might simply quit. As 
you phrased it earlier, it might 
blow a fuse, retreat, refuse to 
function in that area." 

"Well, I didn't do that. What 
else?" 

"It might slip into a delusion 
that it had already taken one of 
the courses of action." 

T NODDED happily. "I didn't 
■*■ kill her. I decided I must; I 
got up, got dressed — and the next 
thing I knew I was outside, wandering, very confused. I got my 
money — and I understand now, 
• with super- empathy, how I can 
win anyone's prize contest — and 
I went looking for a head-shrink er. I found a good one." 

"Thanks," he said dazedly. He 
looked at me with a strangeness 
in his eyes. "And now that you 
know, what's solved? What are 
you going to do?" 

"Go back home," I said happily. "Reactivate the super-organism, exercise it secretly in 



ways that won't make Miss Kew 
unhappy, and we'll stay with her 
as long as we know it pleases 
her. And we'll please her. She'll 
be happy in ways she's never 
dreamed about until now. She 
rates it, bless her strait-laced, 
hungry heart." 

"And she can't kill your — £estalt organism?" 

"Not a chance. Not now." 

"How do you know it isn't 
dead already?" 

"How?" I echoed. "How does 
your head know your arm 
works?" 

He wet his lips. "You're going 
home to make a spinster happy. 
And after that?" 

I shrugged. "After that?" I 
mocked. "Did the Pekin man 
look 'at Homo Sap walking erect 
and say, 'What will he do after 
that?' We'll live, that's all, like 
a man, like a tree, like anything 
else that lives. We'll feed and 
grow and experiment and breed. 
We'll defend ourselves." I spread 
my hands. "We'll just do what 
comes naturally." 

"But what can you do?." 

"What can an electric motor 
do? It depends on where we apply ourselves." 

Stern was very pale. "But 
you're the only such organism . . .** 

"Are we? I don't know. I don't 
think so. I've told you the parts 
have been around for ages — the 
telepaths, the poltergeists. What

was lacking was the ones to organize, to be heads to the scattered bodies. Lone was one, I'm one; 
there must be more. We'll find 
out as we mature." 

"You— aren't mature yet?" 

"Lord, no!" I laughed. "We're 
an infant. We're the equivalent 
of about a three-year-old child. 
So you see, there it is again, and 
this time I'm not afraid of it: 
Baby is three." I looked at my 
hands. "Baby is .three," I said 
again, because the realization 
tasted good. "And when this particular group-baby is five, it 
might want to be a fireman. At 
eight, maybe a cowboy or maybe 
an FBI man. And when it grows 
up, maybe it'll build a city, or 
perhaps it'll be President." 

"Oh, God!" he said. "God!" 

I looked down at him. "You're 
afraid," I said. "You're afraid of 
Homo Gestalt." 

He made a wonderful effort 
and smiled. "That's bastard terminology." 

"We're a bastard breed," I 
said. I pointed. "Sit over there." 

HE crossed the quiet room and 
sat at the desk. I leaned close 
to him and he went to sleep with 
his eyes open. I straightened lip 
and looked around the room. 
Then I got the thermos flask and 
filled it and put it on the desk. I 
fixed the corner of the rug and 
put a clean towel at the head of

the couch. I went to the side of 
the- desk and opened it and looked at the tape recorder. 

Like reaching out a hand, I 
got Beanie. She stood by the desk, 
wide-eyed. 

"Look here," I told her. "Look 
good, now. What I want to do is 
erase all this tape. Go ask Baby 
how." 

She blinked at me and sort of 
shook herself, and then leaned 
over the recorder. She was there 
— and gone — and back, just like 
that. She pushed past me and 
turned two knobs, moved a pointer until it clicked twice. The tape 
raced backward past the head 
swiftly, whining. 

"All right," I said, "beat it." 

She vanished. 

I got my jacket and went to 
the door. Stern was still sitting at 
the desk, staring. 

"A good head-shrinker," I 
murmured. I felt fine. 

Outside I waited, then turned 
and went back in again. 

Stern looked up at me. "Sit 
over there, Sonny." 

"Gee," I said. "Sorry, sir. I got 
in the wrong office." 

"That's all right," he said. 

I went out and closed the door. 
All the way down to -the store to 
buy Miss Kew some flowers, I 
was grinning about how he'd account for the loss of an afternoon 
and the gain of a thousand bucks.
