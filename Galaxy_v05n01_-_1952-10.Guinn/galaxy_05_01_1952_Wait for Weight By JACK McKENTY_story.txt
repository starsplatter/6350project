Wait for Weight By JACK McKENTY 

It was very clever; it not only 
rang chimes of amazing penetrating power, it turned on all 
the lights in the room, closed the 
window, and started his bath water running. But this morning it 
was not appreciated. In fact, as 
Dr. Brinton gpt out of bed, he 
silently called down evil on the 
technician who had built it for 
him. 

The "off" switch was on the 
wall farthest away from his bed 
«nd was controlled by a hairtrigger combination dial that couldn't

be operated by anyone not fully 
awake. Dr. Brinton fumbled for 
a while, then gave up and started 
looking for his bedroom slippers. 
They had apparently crawled 
away during the night. 

He padded into his bathroom 
barefoot. He was about to see 
what a hot bath would do for 
what he had already diagnosed as 
a histamine headache when the 
alarm clock, having decided that 
anyone who could sleep through 
ten minutes of chiming was unwakable, stopped chiming, turned 
off the lights, opened the window, and let all the water out. 

Dr. Brinton was walking back 
toward the light switch when he 
tripped on his bedroom slippers 
and fell back into bed. No further 
invitation was necessary; he slept 
till noon. 

Dr. Brinton unmistakably had 
a hangover. Considering the party 
be had attended the night before, 
it was not surprising. Actually, it 
was remarkable that he had been 
able to get out of bed at all. During the fourteen years that the 
Rocket Research Station had 
been in operation, the parties that 
were held every time another test 
flight resulted in failure had 
grown from a few drinks in somebody's room to a mammoth bustup that left the whole place 
partially paralyzed for days afterward. 

First as thief chemist, and later 



as director of the Station, Dr. 
Brinton had attended every one 
of the scores of parties durin.every one of the fourteen years 
It spoke well for his endurance t«« 
say that he was back at his office 
at one o'clock. Some people didn' t 
make it until the next day. 

HIS secretary, who didn't 
drink, was one of very few 
who were at work on time. She 
walked into his office and stood 
in front of his desk, tapping her 
foot. Her facial expression showed 
that she thought people who got 
drunk at parties were amoral, degenerate, and entirely unfit for 
administrative positions. Dr. 
Brinton, who had been, mentally 
comparing the relative merits of 
Prussic acid and hanging as pain 
relievers, sat up straight to prove 
that he was moral, alert, and 
ready for any problem that might 
come up. His secretary sniffed to 
indicate that she didn't believe 
him. Dr. Brinton dropped his eyes 
to admit that maybe he wasn't at 
his best at the moment, but it was 
only a temporary condition, and 
by tomorrow he would be okay 
"In two minutes you'll wish 
you were dead," said his secre 
tary. "Read this." 

She handed him a letter. He 
read it and his knuckles cracked 
as he gripped the arms of his 
chair. 

"Senator MacNeill coming to

GALAXY SCIENCE FtCTIOM 



visit here?" he cried in alarm. 
Though his voice was squeaky, 
he was surprised to hear it at all. 
"Get me a line to Washington, 
our top priority, Audrey at the 
Naval Department." 

The call was put through. 
"Commander Audrey? This is 
Brinton at the Station. Joe 
MacNeill is coming to visit us. 
Can you head him off? ... 

"Yes, I know, but he's on one 
of his economy drives. We just 
did a test yesterday and if he 
inspects this place now, we won't 
get enough money to build a pinball machine. Delay him a week, 
anyway ... 

"Well, try. I'll arrange a tour 
for him as best I can, but if he 
doesn't come, I'll be much happier. Let me know as soon as 
possible. Fine. Good-by." 

He scribbled a memo and carried it out .to his secretary. -'Copy 
of this to all department heads, 
right away. Phone the commissary and have them get all the 
decorations taken down in the 
dining room. Tell them to lay in 
some steaks for tomorrow. Phone 
Harry Sparling in Public Relations — alert him V.V.I. P. tomorrow, extra-special tour including 
all our movies on the subject. 
I'm going over to the Fuels Department."* 

Dr. Ferber, head of Fuels, met 
Dr. Brinton at the door of his lab. 
"I just got your memo," he 



said. "Is that budget-butcher 
really coming down here?" 

Dr. Brinton nodded his head 
gently. "I'm afraid so. I came 
over to see what kind of show we 
can put on for him." 

"We have some samples to ruj 
on the indoor motors. There are 
a couple of loads left for the 
acceleration sled. And I suppose 
if we work all night we could get 
a sergeant-major ready, but if 
he's on an economy drive that 
might be, too elaborate. Just a 
view of everybody pouring stuff 
from one test-tube to another 
might be best." 

"Do the samples and run the 
sled once," Dr. Brinton said. 
"That should provide enough fire 
and noise. The rest of it will have 
to be fast talk. I think I'll go 
home to bed." 

T\R. BRINTON considered 
himself a methodical man. 
He had bacon and eggs every 
morning for breakfast. He always 
took a vitamin pill with his afternoon coffee. And he was used 
to exactly eight hours sleep. It 
was this last habit that caused 
him to wake up that night at 
midnight; he had gone to bed at 
four that afternoon and habit is 
a hard thing to break. At first he 
thought it was morning, but a 
glance at his watch hanging on 
its illuminated pedestal corrected 
that

He grunted, rolled over, and 
waited for sleep to overtake him 
again. Nothing happened. He 
turned and stared at the ceiling 
for a while. Still nothing; he had 
not felt so wide awake for a long 
time. Then he was struck by one 
of the flashes of inspiration that 
had made him famous — he would 
raid the refrigerator. 

DOWNSTAIRS, he found that 
his son Eric had anticipated 
him by two minutes, and was 
busy setting the table with cheese, 
pickles, ice cream, peanut butter, 
and everything else necessary to 
keep a sixteen-year-old boy operating at peak efficiency. A pile 
of books on the table indicated 
that he had just finished his 
homework. Dr. Brinton was 
pleased that his son had worked 
so late, but the choice of food 
made him shudder. He rummaged 
In the refrigerator himself, found 
a cold pork chop that Eric had 
somehow overlooked, and bore 
it to the table in triumph. 

"We were dealt a blow today," 
he said, between mouthfuls. 

"Oh?" said Eric, on guard in 
case it was about his school work. 

"Received word that Senator 
MacNeill is coming here tomorrow. No, today — it's after midnight." 

"Oh" It was an "Oh" of relief. A senator couldn't be nearly 
as troublesome as a teacher. 



"Don't say 'oh' like that. He'll 
probably close the Station tight 
and we'll all be out of work. You 
don't realize, it, but money has 
been getting harder and harder 
to cadge for this place. We're 
practically running only the 
Fuels department now." 

He got up, threw the bone from 
his pork chop into a garbage pail, 
washed his hands at the sink, and 
sat down again. 

He continued, "Wait till he 
finds out about those four reactor rockets that are cooling off 
on the Moon, waiting for us to 
get there. I can hear him scream, 
'Five million dollars each! Each 
full of precious equipment, to say 
nothing of invaluable fissionable 
material!' And then this place 
gets shut down." 

Eric had a suggestion. "Give 
him the old routine about how 
we have to get men to the Moon 
or the Russians will do it first 
and use all the equipmeat we've 
sent there without even thanking 
us." 

"Umm," said his father, considering. He shook his head finally. "His answer to that is why 
send good money after bad. No. 
I just hope he feels better after 
a steak dinner. Either that or the 
wings fall* off his plane." He 
smiled wistfully at the thought. 
"Oh, well," he said, "let's go to 
bed." * 

They went their separate ways, 



74

but only Eric went to bed. His 
father entered the library, sat 
down, got his pipe going, and 
began to reread How to Win 
Friends, and Influence People. 

HPHE next day saw Dr. Brinton 
contemplate suicide, homicide, and voting Republican, 
though riot necessarily in that 
order. The Senator had viewed 
their most inspiring onward-andupward movies and merely asked 
how much they cost to make. He 
had eaten a huge steak at the 
commissary, and then inspected 
the garbage cans for waste. His 
visits to various departments had 
been marred by his lack of interest in anything except the 
number of men employed by each 
and their average salaries, though 
he did comment that they all 
looked hung-over. In the Fuels 
Department, he had walked out 
on the demonstrations, interrupting some actual experiments that 
were going on outside the test 
room. 

Dr. Brinton was now riding in 
the back of a jeep, explaining to 
the Senator that nuclear rockets 
were not too efficient, and the 
shielding necessary to make them 
safe for men weighed more than 
their payload. The Senator noted 
down the word "inefficient." 

"A loudspeaker on a pole a little 
farther down the road interrupted 
the explanation. "Twenty-five, 



twenty-five, twenty-five,"" it 
shouted. "Five-nine, eighteen. 
Five r nine, eighteen. Seventy three, ten-eight." It began to repeat the message. 

The driver, who had slowed 
while they listened to the message, turned the jeep around and 
sped them back the other way 

"What in Heaven's name was 
that?" asked the Senator, who 
was busy hanging on. 

"Twenty-five means emergency," shouted Dr. Brinton. "Five 
and nine is fire and explosion in 
the Fuels Department, which is 
eighteen. Seventy-three is my call 
number and ten -eight means they 
want me to get there in a hurry." 

For the first time, the Senator 
looked impressed. Then he grew 
angry again when his hat blew off 
and the driver wouldn't stop to 
go back and get it. The jeep took 
a shortcut across the concrete 
fence, and left tire marks in the 
grass in front of the Fuels Department. Dr. Brinton jumped 
out and ran into the building, 
leaving the Senator to argue with 
the driver about going back for 
the hat. 

The lab outside the test room 
was dusty and littered with 
broken glass. Two technicians 
were receiving first aid for minor 
cuts, but everyone else seemed 
to be in an almost holiday mood. 

Dr. Ferber saw Dr. Brinton 
standing in the doorway and 



WAIT FOR WEIGHT 



75 



came over to him immediately. 

"That telephone operator gets 
too excited," he said. "There's 
no fire, and I think it was an 
implosion, not an explosion. 
Wrecked our new pressure catalyzer. Harrison's gone to hospital and the two you see are hurt, 
but none of it's very serious. I 
suppose Butcher Boy is going to 
put this down in his little notebook, too." 

"If you are referring to me," 
said the Senator's voice behind 
them, "I most certainly am going 
to make a note of it. And I 
suggest you both start advertising for other jobs." 

I^RINTON had been indulging 
in a pleasant little fantasy in 
which he had cut Senator MacTJeill up into twenty-eight pieces, 
placed them in aluminum cans, 
and made them radioactive in 
the Station pile. He was smiling 
at the newsreel cameras, about to 
fire the first Senator-powered 
spaceship in the history of mankind, when his alarm clock, which 
had maliciously been waiting for 
just such an opportunity, spoiled 
his dream by waking him up. 

That was how the next day 
started. It continued in the same 
vein when, in a fit of petulance, 
he strode into his clothes closet 
and kicked the alarm control box, 
barefoot. He was working the 
combination dial for the third or 



fourth time when he noticed that 
his feet were getting wet. His 
kick must have jammed some relays in the control box; the bath 
water was overflowing. Since the 
box was sealed to prevent him 
from fooling with it, he had had 
to prevent a flood by limping 
downstairs and pulling the master switch. 

With no electricity, his breakfast consisted of cold fruit juke, 
cold cereal, and cold milk. When 
he got to his office, he ordered a 
pot of coffee and made out a 
requisition for a pipe wrench. If 
it ever happened again, he was 
going to shut the water off in- r 
stead. 

His secretary came in with the 
coffee and poured him a cup. 

"I have some letters for you to 
sign," she said brightly, to cheer 
him up. Dr. Brinton drank his 
coffee. "Our new filing system is 
working very well," she added, 
pouring him another cup. The 
doctor's face relaxed a little, but 
it was because the snow bank in 
his stomach was beginning to 
melt. His secretary played her 
trump. "And somebody from the 
Fuels Department phoned and 
said something was passing the 
yellow line and might make the 
blue." 

She was never sure afterward 
whether Dr. Brinton had gone 
around his desk, or over it. She 
had blinked and by the time her 



76 




 



eyes were open again, he was 
gone. 

Dr. Brinton found a crowd in 
the indoor test lab, chuckling 
over the line being drawn by a 
differential analyzer. He elbowed 
his way to the front, looked himself, and began a little dance of 
impatience. The . analyzer was 
connected with linkages to the 
test stand where a tiny rocket 
motor was thrusting out a hot 
blue pencil of flame. The results 
from the analyzer were plotted 
as range capability against time 
on a piece of graph paper which 
had four curved colored lines 
overprinted on it. The curved 
lines were marked in succession: 
"Earth," "Moon," "Moon" and 
"Earth." 

If the first Earth line, colored 
red, was passed, the fuel under 
test could power a rocket to leave 
Earth, carrying men with it. If 
the yellow line— the first Moon 
line — was reached, the rocket 
could theoretically land men on 
the Moon. Several rockets, carrying dummy loads, had already 
tried and failed: their fuels, 
though the best available, barely 
reached the yellow line when 
under test. 

The blue — second — Moon line 
was calculated to indicate an escape from, the Moon without refueling, and the last line, in green, 
was. a theoretical powered landing back on Earth. 



The pen of the analyzer had 
already passed the blue line and 
was more than halfway to the 
green! 

"rphis is the stuff that was left 
in the catalyzer after the explosion yesterday!" Dr. Ferber 
shouted to Dr. Brinton over the 
roar from the little engine. "It 
looked as if it would burn, so 
I tested it. Jackpot!" 

"What is it?" asked Dr. Brinton. 

"Supposed to be an artificial 
base for a perfume!" 

The last word seemed louder 
because the test rocket just then 
ran out of fuel and grew silent. 
The tracing of the pen stopped 
a fraction short of the green line. 

Dr. Ferber continued in his 
normal voice while he busied 
himself with the connections of 
the engine : "We didn't have anything to do to put on a show for 
MacNeill yesterday, so I told 
the lads to carry on with experiments of their own. It was 
Harrison who made this stuff. 
He was cut by flying glass and 
landed in the hospital. I phoned 
there this morning and found the 
damn fool doctor took his appendix out. Said he figured he might 
as well while Harrison was ki 
there. He's still under the anesthetic and we won't be able to 
ask him anything for several 
hours."

"Doesn't matter," said Dr. 
Biinton. "We know it works; we 
have to find out why it works. 
Got any left? We'll analyze it." 

The next few hours saw Dr. 
Brinton rapidly become a bitter 
and disillusioned man. 

When a qualitative test informed them that the presence of 
nitrogen meant they were going 
to have to use an even longer and 
more laborious process than the 
ordinary one, he uttered a few 
sentences that made a couple of 
nearby German exchange students wonder if perhaps they 
hadn't a portion missed in the 
English language learning. 

When he found that he had 
forgotten his pipe at home, and 
the analysis required too much 
of their attention to allow him 
to go home and get it, he quoted 
s paragraph or two that earned 
him the undivided attention of 
everyone in the lab. 

But when he took the results 
©ver to a calculator and worked 
them out to carbon 281.6% he 
had barely started the prologue 
when frustration overtook him 
and he subsided, speechless. He 
was at a loss to say or do anything except mumble that 281.6% 
was impossible. 

DR. FERBER came over and 
took the paper with the results from him. Everyone in the 
lab watched while he checked the 



calculations patiently. 

A delegation minutely checked 
the apparatus the two doctors 
had used; it was faultless. One 
person even went so far as to cast 
a suspicious look at the big automatic micro-balance standing on 
its pedestal in the center of the 
room. He weighed a piece of 
paper, wrote his name on it in 
pencil and reweighed it. The 
difference was satisfactory. For 
a few moments, they all just 
stood and looked at each other. 
Then the whole lot of them set 
to work. 

A junior technician headed for 
the spectrograph, came back in 
three minutes with a freshly developed spectral photograph and 
a puzzled look. He spent some 
time comparing both of them 
with the illustrations in a manual 
entitled Structural Formulae as 
Indicated by Spectral Groupings. 

The two German exchange 
students made a few tries at 
finding the class of compound. 
They soon were deep in a technical discussion in their own language, the only recognizable words 
being "biuret," "dumkopf," and 
"damn." 

A senior research chemist tried 
crystalizing some and invented 
an entirely new swear word. 

With four helpers, Dr. Brinton 
and Dr. Ferber redid the combustion analysis in slightly less 
than twice the time it would have 



78 



GALAXY SCISNCE FICTION 



taken only one of them. Of course 
they were assured of accuracy; 
each ' step was checked at least 
twice by everyone. 

The result was still carbon 
281.6%. 

Dr. Brinton escaped - the ensuing mental paralysis since he 
had already been through the experience once. He went over and 
began to study the figures written in on the side of the spectral 
photograph. Out of little more 
than idle curiosity,- he compared 
the ratios of the rough quantitative estimate found spectrographically with the more 
accurate but impossible answer of 
the combustion micro-analysis. 

While he was doing the necessary figuring, he listened sympathetically to the technician. The 
young man was complaining bitterly about things in general, and 
chemistry in particular. Chemical reference books came in for 
a special roasting, because: 
"either that lousy book is incomplete, or this structural formula is out of this world." 

That did it. 

Brinton got out a scratch pad 
and drew a little diagram. 

Then he went to talk to Dr. 
Ferber. 

"Would it be possible that 
Harrison started with a multiringed phenol?" he asked. Dr. 
Ferber nodded. Dr. Brinton showed him the drawing. "Does that 



remind you of any ; >m i i.-nl 
figure?" 

Dr. Ferber looked. There was 
a pause, then his eyes lit up. 

"Of course," he said. "Since 
formulae are usually drawn in 
one plane, I doubt if anyone 
ever noticed that before. And 
when it comes under stress by 
compression, it's only natural 
that it should fold." He paused 
and looked at the calendar, 
"Four weeks?" he asked. 

"That'll do fine," said Dr. Brinton. "I'll arrange the details. You 
look after the fuel. Harrison can 
give us the details of this one, 
but there are probably any number of fuels based on this principal. Some will be even more 
efficient, too." 

He excused himself, went to a 
phone, and asked for a Washington number. The call was answered. 

"Hello, Senator MacNeill?" he 
said. "How would you like to be 
guest of honor at a party ?" 

"DRINTON peered through the 
ring of reporters over to the 
head table where Senator MacNeill was speaking, and speaking, 
and speaking. 

"He's on his home state," Dr. 
Brinton said. "About half an 
hour to go. Now, gentlemen, you 
were asking about the new fuel. 
You all received press handouts 
containing the information. You 



WAIT FOR WEIGHT 



79 



will probably receive copies of 
the Senator's speech. And the 
broadcast from our first men on 
the Moon went out over several 
networks hours ago. It seems to 
me that you have enough for several stories." 

One of the reporters asked bewilderedly, "What is a tesseract? 
I read the handout twice and I 
still don't understand." 

"A mathematician would be 
better qualified to explain," said 
Dr. Brinton, "but I'll try. A tesseract is a fourth dimensional 
cube. A line has one dimension, 
a square has two, a cube has 
three, and a tesseract has four. A 
cube can be unfolded into six 
squares, and a tesseract unfolds 
to eight cubes. The new fuel had 
a molecular structure resembling an unfolded tesseract. When 
pressure is applied,' it folds up 
into a tesseract so that it takes up 
less room and relieves the pressure. 

4 'The practical application is 
that we can get eight pounds of it 
into a one pound can. The other 
seven pounds of it are riding 
around in the fourth dimension. 
As soon as it starts to burn, the 
structure is destroyed, so that it 
comes back out of the fourth dimension. Several people have assured me that it can't work. 



They're probably right, excej i 
that it does. Oh, I'll be back ?> 
a minute." 

He went over to another group 
and spoke to one of its member?. 
The man addressed nodded his 
head and left. Dr. Brinton returned. 

"If there are no more questions, 
I suggest we do some serious 
drinking. I am now out of a job 
and I want to celebrate." 

PROMPTLY at seven-thirty, a 
relay clicked and the alarm 
clock went into its usual daily 
routine with the chimes, window, 
lights, and bath water. 

Dr. Brinton woke up enough to 
reach out a lazy arm and flip a 
newly installed toggle switch beside his bed. Everything returned 
to normal. The light and the 
chimes both faded away, the window reopened, and a soft gurgling 
came from the bathroom. 

A slight gurgling also came 
from the bed, where Dr. Brinton, 
with a happy little smile on his 
face, had gone peacefully back 
to sleep, perfectly satisfied that 
he had worked himself into unemployment by finding the fuel 
that would power spaceships to 
— and from — any part of the Solar System.
