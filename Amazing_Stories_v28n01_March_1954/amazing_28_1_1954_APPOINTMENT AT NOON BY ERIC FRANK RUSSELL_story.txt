APPOINTMENT AT NOON BY ERIC FRANK RUSSELL 

He had no calling card, no references, nor any ap- 
parent reason for coming. But he would not be put off. 



Henry curran was big, busy 
and impatient of triflers. He 
had the build of a wrestler, the 
soul of a tiger, and his time was 
worth a thousand bucks and hour. 
He knew of nobody who rated 
more. 

And crime did not pay? Bah! 

Jungle tactics paid off. The 
entire opposition had been con- 
ditioned out of men by what 
is called civilisation. 

Entering his spacious office with 
the swift, heavy tread of a large 
man in fighting trim, Henry slung 
his hat onto a hook, glanced at 
the wall-clock, noted that it regis- 
tered ten minutes to twelve. 

Planting himself in the seat 
behind his desk, he kept his 
expectant gaze upon the door 
through which he had entered. 
His wait lasted about ten seconds. 
Scowling at the thought of it, 
Curran reached over and thumbed 



a red stud on his big desk. 

"What's wrong with you?" he 
snapped when Miss Reed came in. 
"You get worse every day. Old 
age creeping over you or some- 
thing?" 

She posed, tall, neat and pre- 
cise, facing him cross the desk, 
her eyes wearing a touch of 
humility born of fear. Curran 
employed only those about whom 
he knew too much. 

"I'm sorry, Mr. Curran, I 
was — " 

"Never mind the alibi. Be 
faster — or else! Speed's what I 
like. Speed — see?" 

"Yes, Mr. Curran." 

"Has Lolordo phoned in yet?" 

"No, Mr. Curran." 

"He should be through by 
now if everything went all right." 
He viewed the clock again, tapped 
irritably on his desk. "If he's 
made a mess of it and the mouth-

piece comes on, tell him to let 
Lolordo stew. He's in no position 
to talk, anyway. A spell in jail 
will teach him not to be stupid." 

"Yes, Mr. Curran. There's an 
old—" 

"Shut up till I've finished. 
If Michaelson calls up and says 
the Firefly got through, ring 
Voss and tell him without delay. 
And I mean without delay! That's 
important!" He mused a moment, 
finished, "There's that meeting 
downtown at twelve-twenty. God 
knows how long it will go on but 
if they want trouble they can 
have it aplenty. If anyone asks, 
you don't know where I am and 
you don't expect me back before 
four." 

"But, Mr. Curran—" 

"You heard what I said. No- 
bodv sees me before four." 

"There's a man already here," 
she got out with a sort of apologe- 
tic breathlessness. "He said you 
have an appointment with him at 
two minutes to twelve." 

"And you fell for a gag like 
that?" He studied her with open 
contempt. 

"I can only repeat what he 
said. He seemed quite sincere." 

"That's a change," scoffed 
Curran. "Sincerity in the outer 
office. He's got the wrong address. 
Go tell him to spread himself 
across the tracks." 

" I said you were out and didn't 
know when you would return. 
He took a seat and said he'd 



wait because you would be back 
at ten to twelve." 

Involuntarily, both stared at 
the clock. Curran bent an arm, 
eyed his wristwatch by way of 
checking the accuracy of the in- 
strument on the wall. 

"That's what the scientific 
bigbrains would call precognition. 
I call it a lucky guess. One minute 
either way would have made him 
wrong. He ought to back horses." 
He made a gesture of dismissal. 
"Push him out — or do I have 
to get the boys to do it for you?" 

"That wouldn't be necessary. 
He is old and blind." 

"I don't give a damn if he's 
armless and legless — that's his 
tough luck. Give him the rush." 

Obediently she left. A few mo- 
ments later she was back with 
the martyred air of one compelled 
to face his wrath. 

"I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Cur- 
ran, but he insists that he has 
a date with you for two minutes 
to twelve. He is to see you about 
a personal matter of major im- 
portance." 

Curran scowled at the wall. 
The clock said four minutes to 
twelve. He spoke with sardonic 
emphasis. 

"I know no blind man and I 
don't forget appointments. Throw 
him down the stairs." 

She hesitated, standing there 
wide-eyed. " I 'm wondering 
whether — "

"Out with it!" 

"Whether he's been sent to 
you by someone who'd rather 
he couldn't identify you by sight." 

He thought it over, said 
"Could be. You use your brains 
once in a while. What's his 
name?" 

"He won't say." 

"Nor state his business?" 

"No." 

"H'm! I'll give him two min- 
utes. If he's panhandling for 
some charity he'll go out through 
the window. Tell him time is 
precious and show him in." 

She went away, brought back 
the visitor, gave him a chair. 
The door closed quietly behind 
her. The clock said three minutes 
before the hour. 

Curran lounged back and sur- 
veyed his caller, finding him tall, 
gaunt and white-haired. The old- 
ster's clothes were uniformly 
black, a deep, somber, solemn 
black that accentuated the bril- 
liance of the blue, unseeing eyes 
staring from his colorless face. 

Those strange eyes were the 
other's most noteworthy feature. 
They held a most curious quality 
of blank penetration as if some- 
how they could look into the 
things they could not look at. 
And they were sorry — sorry for 
what they saw. 

For the first time in his life 
feeling a faint note of alarm, 



Curran said, "What can I do for 
you?" 

"Nothing," responded the 
other. "Nothing at all." 

His low, organlike voice was 
pitched at no more than a whisper 
and with its sounding a queer 
coldness came over the room. He 
sat there unmoving and staring 
at whatever a blind man can see. 
The coldness increased, became 
bitter. Curran shivered despite 
himself. He scowled and got a 
hold on himself. 

"Don't take up my time," 
advised Curran. "State your busi- 
ness or get to hell out." 

"People don't take up time. 
Time takes up people." 

"What the blazes do you 
mean? Who are you?" 

"You know who I am. Every 
man is a shining sun unto himself 
until dimmed by his dark com- 
panion." 

"You're not funny," said Cur- 
ran, freezing. 

"I am never funny." 

The tiger light blazed in Cur- 
ran's eyes as he stood up, placed 
a thick, firm finger near his desk- 
stud. 

"Enough of this tomfoolery! 
What d'you want?" 

Suddenly extending a length- 
less, dimensionless arm, Death 
whispered sadly, "You!" 

And took him. 

At exactly two minutes to 
twelve.
