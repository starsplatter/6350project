SORRY: Wrong Dimension BY ROSS ROCKLYNNE 



Baby didn't cry all day, because 
he had a monster for a play- 
mate. But I didn't know he had a 
playmate, and much less did I 
know it was a monster. The hon- 
est truth is that for the first time 
since baby was born, I had my 
nerves under control, and I didn't 
dare investigate why he wasn't 
crying. I got all the ironing done 
— all of it, mind you — and I got 
Harry's work-clothes mended and 
I also read three installments of 
a Saturday Evening Post serial I'd 
been saving. And besides this 
Mabel, my neighbor, and I had a 
couple or three cups of coffee. We 
also had a giggling fit. I remember 
once we went off into hysterics at 
the picture of ourselves we had — • 
two haggard old wrecks of women, 
worn out at twenty-three from too 
much work around the house. 
"But thank Heavens baby hasn't 
cried all day!" I gurgled when we 
came out of it. 

"Neither has mine," said Mabel, 
who isn't due for six months. 



"Mabel, honest, you kill me," 
I said, "and excuse me while I 
comb my messy hair — because 
I'm not a wreck. Harry said so. 
He says I'm still the best hunk of 
female pulchritude he's met since 
high school — and we've been 
married two years!" 

I went into the bathroom leav- 
ing Mabel choking hysterically 
behind me. When I came out of 
the bathroom, she was hysterical 
but in a different way. She'd dis- 
covered why Harry, Jr., wasn't 
crying. She'd been in the nursery. 
Her face was white as an egg-shell. 

"He's playing with something," 
she chattered. "It's alive. I heard 
it cooing back." 

I ran three steps to baby's crib 
. . . one on the corner of Little 
Jack Horner, one on the sheep of 
Little Bo Peep, one on the cup- 
board of Old Mother Hubbard. 
"Baby!" I almost screamed. But 
baby cooed and gurgled and 
laughed and rocked back and

forth on his diapers. He was play- 
ing with his teething ring, but 
something was trying to jerk the 
teething ring out of his hands. 
And baby liked it. 

Baby lost his hold on the teeth- 
ing ring, and fell on his back. The 
teething ring stayed up in the air 
and then by itself moved toward 
baby's waving hands and let him 
get a hold of it. 

Mabel screeched through her 
teeth, "Baby's got it, the mon- 
ster's got it, now baby's got it!" 
She began to collapse. 

"Don't faint," 1 snapped, "and 
don't let's play tennis." I was 
shaking. I reached into the crib. 
My hands closed around some- 
thing that put ice-water in my 
vertebrae. It was a monster. 

"It's got fur!" I whispered. I 
felt some more. "And clammy 
scales!" I lifted it out of the crib. 
"And a trunk!" I was determined 
to save baby. Baby cried ! 

We got some chairs and sat 
there for ten minutes close to- 
gether while baby played with the 
invisible monster. "I don't know 
what to do!" I said. "It's alive. 
Maybe it's poisonous. But it's 
friendly. Maybe it's another baby!" 

" From another dimension," said 
Mabel. 

"Rot," I said; I think I picked 
that up from the detective in the 
Saturday Evening Post serial. 
"Let's keep our heads." 

"If baby keeps his," said my 

84 



friend Mabel. That got me. "I've 
got to call Harry," I chattered. 
"They don't like him to be called 
at work, but I've got to call him." 

"You'll just worry him," said 
Mabel. ' 4 Call the police." 

"No!" I said. I felt like crying 
myself. Baby was so happy. Maybe 
the baby monster was happy, too. 
The police would do something 
awful to it. But what about my 
maternal instinct? Something told 
me I simply had to save my baby ! 
"I've got to call Harry," I insisted, 
and I went to the 'phone. 

The dial tone sounded peculiar, 
■I remember, but I called Harry's 
place of employment. A brisk fe- 
male voice cut in: 

"What number are you calling, 
please? " 

"CHarlemont 7-890," I whis- 
pered. 

"Sorry. You must have the 
wrong dimension." There was a 
click as she disconnected. I sat 
like a statue. A haggard statue 
with a greasy housedress on. A 
statue that hadn't plucked its eye- 
brows in two months. I had a lot of 
nerve. I was a bad mother, and a 
poor mistress. And I had a swell 
husband, who could lie like a 
trooper. I wasn't any good, I was 
ugly, I was greasy. I cried. 
"Mabel," I choked. 

It took her awhile to get it out 
of me, and then her blue eyes 
flashed. "I told you!" she cried. 
"From another dimension!" In 
her broken-down green wedgies 

 



she clattered toward the door. I 
heard her fighting it. She couldn't 
get it open. Then she tried a win- 
dow. It opened, but she couldn't 
stick her hand out. She flung her- 
self around. 

"Stella," she said, with a quiver 
of that good-looking short upper 
lip of hers, "we're trapped in. 
We're in the middle of some kind 
of fantasy. It's a crazy world we're 
living in, Stella. A-bombs and H- 
bombs and flying saucers and 
space-flight — it's all the fiction 
stuff coming true. Now we're lost 
in some other dimension, and I 
have to get dinner in the oven." 

"Please," I mumbled. "Let's 
don't get desperate about the 
wrong things." I tried all the 
doors and windows in the house, 
and it was true. We were trapped 
in. There was some barrier sur- 
rounding the house. There wasn't 
anything to see outside except a 
kind of grey steam. 

We went back to check on baby. 
He was still playing with the mon- 
ster. I bent over the crib and held 
a fluffy, fifty-cent toy bear out. 
The baby monster took it in- 
visibly out of my hand. He shoved 
it at baby. Baby squealed so 
darned happily. And I began to 
get some perspective. 

"Suspicion is wrong," I told 
Mabel. "All the time. That's what 
that article we read a couple 
months ago in Your World said. 
Remember yo.u and I decided 
we'd never be suspicious. Maybe 



that's the reason we're happy — ■ 
if dirty. We don't suspect any- 
body of anything if we can help it 
— and now's no time to start. The 
monster is baby's friend." 

Mabel shuddered. "Okay," she 
said. "But I'm still worried about 
getting dinner in the oven. Bill's 
liable to — " 

"Hah, now you're being sus- 
picious," I said, lousy with virtue. 
"Quit worrying. I'm going to call 
Harry again." This time I was a 
lot calmer. I decided to trust the 
universe a little more. I dialed 
Harry's number again. A scratchy 
male voice answered : 

"Sorry, dis dimension is in use. 
Would ya please get off da line?" 

I dug a few trenches and estab- 
lished a line of fire. 

"Listen," I said. "I'm in trou- 
ble." 

" Adame," he said wonderingly. 

"Yeah, a dame," I cried. 
"What's so unusual about a 
dame? Why does every male in 
Kingdom Come get that note in 
his voice when he talks with a 
dame? Sure I'm a dame, a good- 
looking dame! I'd like to punch 
you in the eye to prove it!" 

He laughed. He must have 
turned away from the 'phone. 
"It's a dame." 

"Okay, find out what she 
wants." 

"Spill it," he said into the 
'phone. I spilled it. "What's that 
address again?" he asked. I told 



SORRY, WRONG DIMENSION 



85 



him. "Naw, naw," he said impa- 
tiently. "The planet. The planet. 
And the year." I told him. 

He must have turned away 
from the 'phone again, because I 
heard him say off-stage, "They're 
only ten years away." I was numb. 
He came back on the line. "And 
what's dis about a baby monster? 
Fur? Scales? A trunk? The size of 
Harry, Jr.? Ma'am, we'll be there 
in a jiff," and he hung up. 

Mabel was nervously hanging 
on my ear, but I didn't get a 
chance to answer her questions. 
The door in the living room 
opened and they walked in. 

For a second I saw a ship that 
looked like a cake-pan, hanging in 
the grey steam. Then they closed 
the door and grinned at us. In- 
stinctively, Mabel and I tried to 
shrink our bust-lines. 

"Hello," said the tall one. He 
scratched at his hairy chest and 
grinned wider. He was carrying a 
piece of machinery that looked 
like a camera on a tripod. "Lemme 
introduce myself," he said. "Jake 
Comstock. We come over to do 
you dames a favor. We'll kick you 
back where vou belong." 

"Yeah," I said, "I'll bet." 

"And this here is Beany Rocine. 
He's my partner. We — uh — 
work together." 

"Hi dere," said Beany. "Where's 
da monster?" 

"Introductions," said Jake, cast- 
ing him a hard look. "Manners." 

So I introduced us. "I'm Mrs. 



Weaver," I said. "And this is my 
neighbor, Mrs. Aspectia." 

"Pleased ta meetcha, girls," 
grinned Jake. "You, Blondie," he 
was looking at me, "you must be 
the one talked on the 'phone. I 
liked the way you handled Beany. 
Real cute." He dropped the tripod 
thing in a corner, and sidled to- 
ward me. "Now where's this mon- 
ster?" he asked, slipping his hand 
around my bare arm and grinning 
down at me. 

I knew better than to play 
rough, so I just looked down at his 
hand, and didn't stop looking at it 
until he took it away. He lost a 
lot of his grin. "So where is it?" 
he said, his voice turning hard and 
unpleasant. 

"Don't worry about that," I 
said. "Matter of fact, I'm getting 
so the monster doesn't worry me. 
He's been playing with baby all 
day and baby hasn't objected. 
The main thing I'd like you 
gentlemen to do for us is to get 
busy moving us back to our own 
dimension." 

"That's right," said Mabel, her 
hands on her hips. "And let us 
know right now what the charges 
are going to be, if any." 

"No charge," said the runt 
Beany, staring fascinated at her 
legs. "'Cept we're taking da mon- 
ster wit' us. Real expensive, them 
monsters. Drinkos, they're called. 
Dey get lost in da dimensions now 
and then. Picked one up on Pluto

fifty years or so acome — or ago." 

"Ago?" I said. 

"Acome," he corrected. 

"Listen," I said, making up my 
mind. "You can't have the mon- 
ster. He's kept baby happy all 
day. But I'll tell you what I'll do. 
Tell me what he eats and what to 
do for him and I'll keep him. I've 
got twenty-five dollars in poker 
winnings you can have. Okay — • 
Jake?" 

Jake broke out laughing. "You 
kids are terrific," he said. "You 
don't know what the score is. 
You're cute!" 

"Thanks," I said bitterly. "You 
restore my confidence. I feel my- 
self blooming under your hungry 
gaze." 

"Those Drinkos are worth a 
couple million credits, is what I'm 
getting at, and you offer us a 
stinkin' twenty-five dollars. Tell 
you what, Blondie." He winked 
at me. "You kids are over-worked. 
One look and you can tell that. 
Well, Beany and me have got a 
little cabin up on Dimension-L, 
cut off from everything. The four 
of us can go there and have a fine 
old time. We could stay there a 
month, and still get you back 
here in time to kiss your husbands 
when they get in from work. 
Whaddya say, Blondie? And you 
can keep the Drinko ! " 

"We are accepting no proposi- 
tions this week," said Mabel with 
dignity. 

"Ah-h, a coupla kill-joys," 



growled Beany, wandering off to- 1 
ward the hall. 

Mabel looked at me and then 
picked up a vase off the mantle 
over the fire-place. I gave her the 
nod. "Stay away from that 
Drinko," she warned Beany, "or 
I'll let you have it." 

Beany was annoyed. He stopped, 
looking imploringly at Jake. Jake 
giggled as if the whole thing 
tickled his sense of humor, and 
walked cat-footed toward Mabel. 
She let go the vase with a right- 
handed swing. He had his right 
arm out stiff in front of him, 
though, and the vase shied off and 
smashed against the television set. 
Then he grabbed Mabel in a bear- 
hug. 

That set me off. I had a yearn- 
ing for Harry, then. He would 
have laid these mugs out. And 
that's all they were — mugs, cheap 
crooks. I hopped on one leg, yank- 
ing off one of my oxfords. I 
brought the heel down on Jake's 
curly head. But it didn't do a 
thing for him, except make him 
mad. He brought his arm back, 
cursing at me. It caught me on my 
lipstick. I remember being sur- 
prised that he was actually knock- 
ing me out. But that's what he 
did. 

When I woke up, the first thing 
I knew was that Harry, Jr., was 
screaming. I groggily stood up, 
and stepped over Mabel, who was 
just beginning to moan. I went to

the nursery and grabbed up my 
baby. "Don't cry," I begged him. 
"Don't be mad. I'll get your 
Drinko back. Those dirty thieves, 
I'll get it back." I held him under 
one arm, his pants dripping. I 
think I looked like a Pekinese, 
with my hair over my eyes. I went 
to the 'phone, dialed Harry's num- 
ber, and got the same routine. 

' ' I don't have the wrong dimen- 
sion," I cried before the operator 
could hang up. "This is an emer- 
gency. A couple of crooks stole my 
Drinko. Please get me the dimen- 
sion-police." 

"You have a Drinko?" the op- 
erator asked cautiously. "There 
must be some mistake. You are 
calling from Earth? From 1954? I 
am sorry. Congress ruled Earth 
1954 could not be connected with 
the dimension-system. It would be 
impossible for you to own a 
Drinko." 

"Some crooks from 1964 stole 
my Drinko!" I insisted. 

"One moment, please. The Su- 
pervisor informs me this is an un- 
authorized call. It will be necessary 
to conduct a police investigation." 
There were clickings, there were 
buzzings, there were groups of 
fuzzy, far-off voices, and finally 
the police came in. 

"A couple of crooks stole my 
baby's Drinko!" I repeated loudly. 
"I demand my rights as a dimen- 
sion-citizen!" 

"Two thieves confiscated your 
Drinko," a dry voice said. "Very 



well. Describe them, please. De- 
scribe characteristic phrases, ex- 
pressions, and voice-intonations 
also." I described them. "Very 
good. Did you say Earth 1954? 
Excellent. Only a matter of six 
dimensions and thirty years. We 
shall investigate immediately." 
He hung up. 

"Hi, Stella," said Mabel, up on 
one elbow and looking fuzzily at 
me. "You think I'll get out of this 
in time to get Bill's dinner in the 
oven? Bill's so darned touchy 
about dinner." 

"Teach him a lesson, then," I 
snapped, disgusted with her, and 
running to the door, because some- 
body was knocking there. "Train 
him. Disappoint him. Break his 
pattern. Don't have dinner. Good 
evening, gentlemen," I said as I 
opened the door. The police came 
in. They had Beany. They had 
Jake. 

There were three police. The 
one in front, a young, nice-looking 
one, touched his cap and smiled 
quietly. "Here's your Drinko, 
ma'am," he said, but I already 
knew the Drinko was back. Harry, 
Jr., stopped crying. He gurgled 
happily. Somehow, I was willing 
to bet, he could see the Drinko. I 
put him on the floor and the po- 
liceman put the Drinko on the 
floor. It was beautiful, those 
squeals that came from my baby. 
The young policeman smiled again, 
a quiet, tanned smile.

"We want to thank you, ma'am. 
These two are the worst criminals 
in the dimension-system. I want 
you to know you may have the 
Drinko as a reward for your part 
in apprehending them. Also, I 
wish to say that I admire you for 
your trippo in pretending to be a 
dimension-citizen, when, of course, 
you are not." 

"Trippo?" 

"Spunk, if you prefer." 

"Well, I had to get my baby's 
Drinko back," I said. 

"Naturally," he smiled. 
"Drinko's make wonderful pets. 
The day may come when Earth 
1954 will be connected with di- 
mension-system — and then more 
Drinkos will be available." 

"Can't we," I asked, "just stay 
alone in our quiet nook of space? " 

"My thought, too," said Mabel, 
getting to her feet at last and 
throwing her hair back. "And is 
there any chance of getting out of 
here? It's exciting, thrilling, and 
romantic, but Bill still has to eat." 

"Immediately, Madam! It is 
merely a matter of disengaging 
the chrono-beam, which happened 
to become tangled, in space-time, 
with the gravitonic structure of 
the neutronic chrono-field." 

"Well!" said Mabel. "That ex- 
plains it! And so clearly!" 

They set up an instrument that 
looked like the one Jake and Beany 
had. They sighted along the diag- 
onals of the room and pressed but- 
tons. Then they opened the door. 

SORRY, WRONG DIMENSION 



"In two minutes, ma'am," the 
smiling cop said. "Good day. It is 
my hope that we shall meet 
again." They disappeared out the 
door. Sure enough, there was a 
cake-pan ship hanging in the grey 
steam. They piled into it and the 
ship moved off, wobbling, until I 
couldn't see it any more. 

A minute later, the grey steam 
melted away and so did Mabel. 

Harry came home on schedule. 
"Baby has hardly cried all day!" 
I told him happily. "What a re- 
lief! I got a lot of your old clothes 
mended and I read three install- 
ments of the Saturday Evening 
Post serial." 

"Fine!" said Harry, looking 
around. "What else happened?" 

' ' Not much , " I said , deciding to 
break it to him gradually. "Except 
we've got a Drinko." I took him 
into the nursery. Baby was sound 
asleep. I supposed the Drinko was, 
too. "There he is," I said, point- 
ing to the depression at the foot of 
the crib. "That's the Drinko." I 
told Harry the whole story. He 
listened with a straight face. 

"Well!" he said. "What thrill- 
ing adventures you have. Tell me, 
isn't this sort of thing sometimes 
too exciting?" 

"Not at all," I said, deciding to 
feed his stomach before I really 
tried to convince him. "It all 
comes under the heading of the 
drab, routine duties of a house- 
wife. Come on now, dinner's 
ready."
