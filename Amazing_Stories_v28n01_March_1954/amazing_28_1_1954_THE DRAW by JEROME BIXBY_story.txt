THE DRAW by JEROME BIXBY




Joe doolin's my name. Cowhand 
— work for old Farrel over at 
Lazy F beyond the Pass. Never 
had much of anything exciting 
happen to me — just punched 
cows and lit up on payday — 
until the day I happened to ride 
through the Pass on my way to 
town and saw young Buck Tar- 
rant's draw. 

Now, Buck'd always been a 
damn good shot. Once he got 
his gun in his hand he could 
put a bullet right where he 
wanted it up to twenty paces, 
and within an inch of his aim up 
to a hundred feet. But Lord God, 
he couldn't draw to save his life — 
I'd seen him a couple of times 
before in the Pass, trying to. 
He'd face a tree and go into a 
crouch, and' I'd know he was 
pretending the tree was Billy 
the Kid or somebody, and then 
he'd slap leather — and his clumsy 
hand would wallop his gunbutt, 
he'd yank like hell, his old Peace- 
maker would come staggering out 
of his holster like a bear in heat, 
and finally he'd line on his target 
and plug it dead center. But the 
whole business took about a sec- 
ond and a half, and by the time 
he'd ever finished his fumbling 
in a real fight, Billy the Kid 
or Sheriff Ben Randolph over in 
town or even me, Joe Doolin, 
could have cut him in half. 

So this time, when I was riding 
along through the Pass, I saw 
Buck upslope from me under 
the trees, and I just grinned and 
didn't pay too much attention. 

He stood facing an old elm 
tree, and I could see he'd tacked 
a playing card about four feet 



51 



up the trunk, about where a 
man's heart would be. 

Out of the corner of my eye 
I saw him go into his gunman's 
crouch. He was about sixty feet 
away from me, and, like I said, 
I wasn't paying much mind to 
him. 

I heard the shot, flat down the 
rocky slope that separated us. 
I grinned again, picturing that 
fumbly draw of his, the wild slap 
at leather, the gun coming out 
drunklike, maybe even him drop- 
ping it — I'd seen him do that 
once or twice. 

It got me to thinking about 
him, as I rode closer. 

He was a bad one. Nobody said 
any different than that. Just bad. 
He was a bony runt of about 
eighteen, with bulging eyes and 
a wide mouth that was always 
turned down at the corners. He 
got his nickname Buck because 
he had buck teeth, not because 
he was heap man. He was some 
handy with his fists, and he liked 
to pick ruckuses with kids he 
was sure he could lick. But the 
tipoff on Buck is that he'd blat 
like a two-day calf to get out of 
mixing with somebody he was 
scared of — which meant some- 
body his own size or bigger. He'd 
jaw his way out of it, or just turn 
and slink away with his tail 
along his belly. His dad had died 
a couple years before, and he 
lived with his ma on a small 



ranch out near the Pass. The 
place was falling to pieces, be- 
cause Buck wouldn't lift a hand 
to do any work around — his ma 
just couldn't handle him at all. 
Fences were down, and the yard 
was all weedgrown, and the house 
needed some repairs — but all 
Buck ever did was hang around 
town, trying to rub up against 
some of the tough customers who 
drank in the Once Again Saloon, 
or else he'd ride up and lie around 
under the trees along the top 
of the Pass and just think — or, 
like he was today, he'd practise 
drawing and throwing down on 
trees and rocks. 

Guess he always wanted to 
be tough. Really tough. He tried 
to walk with tough men, and, 
as we found out later, just about' 
all he ever thought about while 
he was lying around was how he 
could be tougher than the next 
two guys. Maybe you've known 
characters like that — for gome 
damfool reason they just got to 
be able to whup anybody who 
comes along, and they feel low 
and mean when they can't, as 
if the size of a man's fist was the 
size of the man. 

So that's Buck Tarrant — a 
halfsized, poisonous, no-good kid 
who wanted to be a hardcase. 

But he'd never be, not in a 
million years. That's what made 
it funny — and kind of pitiful 
too. There wasn't no real strength 
in him, only a scared hate. It 



52 



takes guts as well as speed to be 
tough with a gun, and Buck was 
just a nasty little rat of a kid 
who'd probably always counter- 
punch his way through life when 
he punched at all. He'd kite for 
cover if you lifted a lip. 

1 heard another shot, and 
looked up the slope. I was near 
enough now to see that the card 
he was shooting at was a ten of 
diamonds — and that he was 
plugging the pips one by one. 
Always could shoot, like I said. 

Then he heard me coming, 
and whirled away from the tree, 
his gun holstered, his hand held 
out in front of him like he must 
have imagined Hickock or some- 
body held it when he was ready to 
draw. 

I stopped my horse about ten 
feet away and just stared at 
him. He looked real funny in his 
baggy old levis and dirty check- 
ered shirt and that big gun low 
on his hip, and me knowing he 
couldn't handle it worth a damn. 

"Who you trying to scare, 
Buck?" I said. I looked him up 
and down and snickered. "You 
look about as dangerous as a 
sheepherder's wife." 

"And you're a son of a bitch," 
he said. 

I stiffened and shoved out my 
jaw. "Watch that, runt, or I'll get 
off and put my foot in your 
mouth and pull you on like a 
boot!" 



"Will you now," he said nastily, 
"you son of a bitch?" 

And he drew on me . . . and 
I goddam near fell backwards off 
my saddle! 

I swear, I hadn't even seen 
his hand' move, he'd drawn so 
fast! That gun just practically 
appeared in his hand! 

"Will you now?" he said again, 
and the bore of his gun looked 
like a greased gate to hell. 

I sat in my saddle scared spitless. 
wondering if this was w 7 hen I 
was going to die. I moved ray 
hands out away from my body, 
and tried to look friendlylike — 
actually, I'd never tangled with 
Buck, just razzed him a little 
now and then like everybody did : 
and I couldn't see much reason 
why he'd want to kill me. 

But the expression on his face 
was full of gloating, full of wild- 
ness, full of damn-you recklessness 
— exactly the expression you'd 
look to find on a kid like Buck 
who suddenly found out he was 
the deadliest gunman alive. 

And that's just what he was, 
believe me. 

Once I saw Bat Masterson 
draw and he was right up 
there with the very best. Could 
draw and shoot accurately in 
maybe half a second or so — you 
could hardly see his hand move; 
you just heard the slap of hand 
on gunbutt, and a split-second 
later the shot. It takes a lot of 
practise to be able to get a gun 



54 



 



out and on target in that space 
of time, and that's what makes 
gunmen. Practise, and a knack to 
begin with. And, I guess, the yen 
to be a gunman, like Buck Tar- 
rant'd always had. 

When I saw Masterson draw 
against Jeff Steward in Abilene, 
it was that way — slap, crash, 
and Steward was three-eyed. Just 
a blur of motion. 

But when Buck Tarrant drew 
on me, right now in the Pass, 
I didn't see any motion atall. 
He just crouched, and then his 
gun was on me. Must have done 
it in a millionth of a second, if a 
second has millionths. 

It was the fastest draw I'd 
ever seen. It was, I reckoned, 
the fastest draw anybody's ever 
seen. It was an impossibly fast 
draw — a man's hand just 
couldn't move to his holster that 
fast, and grab and drag a heavy 
Peacemaker up in a two foot arc 
that fast. 

It was plain damn impossible 
— but there it was. 

And there I was. 

I didn't say a word. I just sat 
and thought about things, and 
my horse wandered a little farther 
up the slope and then stopped 
to chomp grass. All the time, 
Buck Tarrant was standing there, 
poised, that wild gloating look in 
his eyes, knowing he could kill me 
anytime and knowing I knew it. 

When he spoke, his voice was 

THE DRAW 



shaky — it sounded like he 
wanted to bust out laughing, and 
not a nice laugh either. 

"Nothing to say, Doolin?" he 
said. "Pretty fast, huh?" 

I said, "Yeah, Buck. Pretty 
fast." And my voice was shaky 
too, but not because I felt like 
laughing any. 

He spat, eying me arrogantly. 
The ground rose to where he 
stood, and our heads were about 
on a level. But I felt he was 
looking down. 

"Pretty fast!" he sneered. 
"Faster'n anybody!" 

"I reckon it is, at that," I said. 

"Know how I do it?" 

"No." 

"I think, Doolin. I think my 
gun into my hand. How d'you 
like that?" 

"It's awful fast, Buck." 

"I just think, and my gun is 
there in my hand. Some draw, 
huh!" 

"Sure is." 

"You're damn right it is, Doo- 
lin. Faster'n anybody!" 

I didn't know what his gabbling 
about "thinking his gun into his 
hand" meant — at least not 
then, I didn't — but I sure wasn't 
minded to question him on it. 
He looked wild-eyed enough right 
now to start taking bites out of 
the nearest tree. 

He spat again and looked me 
up and down. "You know, you 
can go to hell, Joe Doolin. You're 
a lousy, God damn, white-livered 

55 



son of a bitch." He grinned coldly. 

Not an insult, I knew now, 
but a deliberate taunt. I'd broken 
jaws for a lot less — I'm no runt, 
and I'm quick enough to hand 
back crap if some lands on me. 
But now I wasn't interested. 

He saw I was mad, though, 
and stood waiting. 

"You're fast enough, Buck," 
I said, "so I got no idea of trying 
you. You want to murder me, 
I guess I can't stop you — but 
I ain't drawing. No, sir, that's 
for sure." 

"And a coward to boot," he 
jeered. 

"Maybe," I said. "Put your- 
self in my place, and ask yourself 
why in hell I should kill myself?" 

"Yellow!" he snarled, looking 
at me with his bulging eyes full 
of meanness and confidence. 

My shoulders got tight, and 
it ran down along my gun arm. 
I never took that from a man 
before. 

"I won't draw," I said. "Reck- 
on I'll move on instead, if you'll 
let me." 

And I picked up my reins, 
moving my hands real careful- 
like, and turned my horse around 
and started down the slope. I 
could feel his eyes on me, and 
I was half-waiting for a bullet in 
the back. But it didn't come. 
Instead Buck Tarrant called, 
"Doolin!" 

I turned my head. "Yeah?" 

He was standing there in the 



same position. Somehow he re- 
minded me of a crazy, runt 
wolf — his eyes were almost yel- 
lowish, and when he talked he 
moved his lips too much, mouth- 
ing his words, and his big crooked 
teeth flashed in the sun. I guess 
all the hankering for toughness 
in him was coming out — he was 
acting now like he'd always 
wanted to — cocky, unafraid, 
mean — because now he wore a 
bigger gun than anybody. It 
showed all over him, like poison 
coming out of his skin. 

"Doolin," he called. "I'll be 
in town around three this after- 
noon. Tell Ben Randolph for me 
that he's a son of a bitch. Tell 
him he's a dunghead sheriff. Tell 
him he'd better look me up when 
I get there, or else get outa town 
and stay out. You got that?" 

"I got it, Buck." 

"Call me Mr. Tarrant, you 
Irish bastard." 

"Okay . . . Mr. Tarrant," I 
said, and reached the bottom of 
the slope and turned my horse 
along the road through the Pass. 
About a hundred yards farther 
on, I hipped around in the saddle 
and looked back. He was practis- 
ing again — the crouch, the fan- 
tastic draw, the shot. 

I rode on toward town, to 
tell Ben Randolph he'd either 
have to run or die. 

Ben was a lanky, slab-sided 
Texan who'd come up north on a 



56 



" 



drive ten years before and liked 
the Arizona climate and stayed. 
He was a good sheriff — tough 
enough to handle most men, and 
smart enough to handle the rest. 
Fourteen years of it had kept him 
lean and fast. 

When I told him about Buck, I 
could see he didn't know whether 
he was tough or smart or fast 
enough to get out of this one. 

He leaned back in his chair 
and started to light his pipe, and 
then stared at the match until 
it burned his ringers without 
touching it to the tobacco. 
"You sure, Joe?" he said. 
"Ben, I saw it four times. 
At first I just couldn't believe 
my eyes — but I tell you, he's 
fast. He's faster'n you or me or 
Hickock or anybody. God knows 
where he got it, but he's got the 
speed." 

"But," Ben Randolph said, 
lighting another match, "it just 
don't happen that way." His 
voice was almost mildly com- 
plaining. "Not overnight. Gun- 
speed's something you work on — 
it comes slow, mighty slow. You 
know that. How in hell could 
Buck Tarrant turn into a fire- 
eating gunslinger in a few days?" 
He paused and puffed. "You 
sure, Joe?" he asked again, 
through a cloud of smoke. 
"Yes." 

"And he wants me." 
"That's what he said." 
Ben Randolph sighed. "He's 

THE DRAW 



a bad kid, Joe — just a bad 
kid. If his father hadn't died, I 
reckon he might have turned out 
better. But his mother ain't big 
enough to wallop his butt the 
way it needs." 

"You took his gun away from 
him a couple times, didn't you 
Ben?" 

" Yeah. And ran him outa town 
too, when he got too pestiferous. 
Told him to get the hell home 
and help his ma." 

"Guess that's why he wants 
you." 

_ "That. And because I'm sheriff. 
I'm the biggest gun around here, 
and he don't want to start at the 
bottom, not him. He's gonna show 
the world right away." 
"He can do it, Ben." 
He sighed again. "I know. If 
what you say's true, he can sure 
show me anyhow. Still, I got to 
take him up on it. You know 
that. I can't leave town." 

I looked at his hand lying on' 
his leg — the fingers were trem- 
bling. He curled them into a 
fist, and the fist trembled. 
"You ought to, Ben," I said. 
"Of course I ought to," he 
said, a little savagely. "But I 
can't. Why, what'd happen to 
this town if I was to cut and 
run? Is there anyone else who 
could handle him? Hell, no." 

"A crazy galoot like that," 
I said slowly, "if he gets too 
damn nasty, is bound to get 
kilt." I hesitated. "Even in the 

57 



back, if he's too good to take from 
the front." 

"Sure," Ben Randolph said. 
"Sooner or later. But what about 
meantime? . . . how many peo- 
ple will he have to kill before 
somebody gets angry or nervy 
enough to kill him? That's my 
job, Joe — to take care of this 
kind of thing. Those people he'd 
kill are depending on me to get 
between him and them. Don't 
you see?" 

I got up. "Sure, Ben, I see. 
I just wish you didn't." 

He let out another mouthful 
of smoke. "You got any idea 
what he meant about thinking 
his gun into his hand?" 

"Not the slightest. Some crazy 
explanation he made up to ac- 
count for his sudden speed, I 
reckon." 

Another puff. "You figure I'm 
a dead man, Joe, huh?" 

"It looks kind of that way." 

"Yeah, it kind of does, don't 
it?" 

At four that afternoon Buck 
Tarrant came riding into town 
like he owned it. He sat his 
battered old saddle like a rajah 
on an elephant, and he held his 
right hand low beside his hip in 
an exaggerated gunman's stance. 
With his floppy hat over at a 
cocky angle, and his big eyes 
and scrawny frame, he'd have 
looked funny as hell trying to 
look like a tough hombre — ex- 



cept that he was tough now, and 
everybody in town knew it be- 
cause I'd warned them. Otherwise 
somebody might have jibed him, 
and the way things were now, 
that could lead to a sudden 
grave. 

Nobody said a word all along 
the street as he rode to the 
hitchrail in front of the Once 
Again and dismounted. There 
wasn't many people around to 
say anything — most everybody 
was inside, and all you could 
see of them was a shadow of 
movement behind a window there, 
the flutter of a curtain there. 

Only a few men sat in chairs 
along the boardwalks under the 
porches, or leaned against the 
porchposts, and they just sort 
of stared around, looking at Buck 
for a second and then looking 
off again if he turned toward 
them. 

I was standing near to where 
Buck hitched up. He swaggered 
up the steps of the saloon, his 
right hand poised, his bulging 
eyes full of hell. 

"You tell him?" he asked. 

I nodded. "He'll look you up, 
like you said." 

Buck laughed shortly. "I'll be 
waiting. I don't like that lanky 
bastard. I reckon I got some 
scores to settle with him." He 
looked at me, and his face twisted 
into what he thought was a tough 
snarl. Funny — you could see 
he really wasn't tough down in- 



58 



 



side. There wasn't any hard core 
of confidence and strength. His 
toughness was in his holster, 
and all the rest of him was acting 
to match up to it. 

"You know," he said, "I don't 
like you either, Irish. Maybe I 
oughta kill you. Hell, why not?" 

Now, the only reason I'd stayed 
out of doors that afternoon was 
I figured Buck had already had 
one chance to kill me and hadn't 
done it, so I must be safe. That's 
what I figured — he had nothing 
against me, so I was safe. And 
I had an idea that maybe, when 
the showdown came, I might be 
able to help out Ben Randolph 
somehow — if anything on God's 
Earth could help him. 

Now, though, I wished to hell 
I hadn't stayed outside. I wished 
I was behind one of them win- 
dows, looking out at somebody 
else get told by Buck Tarrant 
that niaybe he oughta kill him. 

"But I won't," Buck said, 
grinning nastily. "Because you 
done me a favor. You run off 
and told the sheriff just like I 
told you — just like the goddam 
white-livered Irish sheepherder 
you are. Ain't that so?" 

I nodded, my jaw set so hard 
with anger that the flesh felt 
stretched. 

He waited for me to move 
against him. When I didn't, he 
laughed and swaggered to the door 
of the saloon. "Come on, Irish," 
he said over his shoulder. "I'll 



buy you a drink of the best." 

I followed him in, and he went 
over to the bar, walking heavy, 
and looked old Menner right in 
the eye and said, "Give me a 
bottle of the best stuff you got 
in the house." 

Menner looked at the kid he'd 
kicked out of his place a dozen 
times, and his face was white. 
He reached behind him and got 
a bottle and put it on the bar. 

"Two glasses," said Buck Tar- 
rant. 

Menner carefully put two 
glasses on the bar. 

"Clean glasses." 

Menner polished two other 
glasses on his apron and set 
them down. 

"You don't want no money 
for this likker, do you, Menner?" 
Buck asked. 

"No, sir." 

"You'd just take it home and 
spend it on that fat heifer of a 
wife you got, and on them two 
little halfwit brats, wouldn't 
you?" 

Menner nodded. 

"Hell, they really ain't worth 
the trouble, are they?" 

"No, sir." 

Buck snickered and poured two 
shots and handed me one He 
looked around the saloon and 
saw that it was almost empty — 
just Menner behind the bar, and 
a drunk asleep with his head on 
his arms at a table near the back, 



THE DRAW 



59 



and a little gent in fancy town 
clothes fingering his drink at a 
table near the front window and 
not even looking at us. 

"Where is everybody?" he 
asked Menner. 

"Why, sir, I reckon they're 
home, most of them," Menner 
said. "It being a hot day and 
all — " 

"Bet it'll get hotter," Buck 
said, hard. 
"Yes, sir." 

"I guess they didn't want to 
really feel the heat, huh?" 
"Yes, sir." 

"Well, it's going to get so hot, 
you old bastard, that everybody '11 
feel it. You know that?" 

"If you say so, sir." 

"It might even get hot for 
you. Right now even. What do 
you think of that, huh?" 

"I — I—" 

"You thrun me outa here a 
couple times, remember?" 
"Y-yes ... but I — " 
"Look at this!" Buck said — 
and his gun was in his hand, 
and he didn't seem to have moved 
at all, not an inch. I was looking 
right at him when he did it — 
his hand was on the bar, resting 
beside his shotglass, and then 
suddenly his gun was in it and 
pointing right at old Menner's 
belly. 

"You know," Buck said, grin- 
ning at how Menner's fear was 
crawling all over his face, "I 
can put a bullet right where I 



want to. Wanta see me do it?" 

His gun crashed, and flame 
leaped across the bar, and the 
mirror behind the bar had a 
spiderweb of cracks radiating from 
a round black hole. 

Menner stood there, blood leak- 
ing down his neck from a split 
earlobe. 

Buck's gun went off again, and 
the other earlobe was a red tatter. 

And Buck's gun was back in its 
holster with the same speed it had 
come out — I just couldn't see 
his hand move. 

"That's enough for now," he 
told Menner. "This is right good 
likker, and I guess I got to have 
somebody around to push it across 
the bar for me, and you're as good 
as anybody to do jackass jobs like 
that." 

He didn't ever look at Menner 
again. The old man leaned back 
against the shelf behind the bar, 
trembling, two trickles of red 
running down his neck and stain- 
ing his shirt collar — I could see 
he wanted to touch the places 
where he'd been shot, to see how 
bad they were or just to rub at 
the pain, but he was afraid to 
raise a hand. He just stood there, 
looking sick. 

Buck was staring at the little 
man in town clothes, over by the 
window. The little man had reared 
back at the shots, and now he was 
sitting up in his chair, his eyes 
straight on Buck. The table in 



60 



 



front of him was wet where he'd 
spilled his drink when he'd 
jumped. 

Buck looked at the little guy's 
fancy clothes and small mustache 
and grinned. "Come on," he said 
to me, and picked up his drink 
and started across the floor. "Find 
out who the dude is." 

He pulled out a chair and sat 
down — and I saw he was careful 
to sit facing the front door, and 
also where he could see out the 
window. 

I pulled out another chair and 
sat. 

"Good shooting, huh?" Buck 
asked the little guy. 

"Yes," said the little guy. 
"Very fine shooting. I confess, it 
quite startled me." 

Buck laughed harshly. "Startled 
the old guy too . . ." He raised 
his voice. "Ain't that right, Mea- 
ner? Wasn't you startled?" 

"Yes, sir," came Menner's pain- 
filled voice from the bar. 

Buck looked back at the little 
man — let his insolent gaze travel 
up and down the fancy waistcoat, 
the string tie, the sharp face with 
its mustache and narrow mouth 
and black eyes. He looked longest 
at the eyes, because they didn't 
seem to be scared. 

He looked at the little guy, and 
the little guy looked at Buck, and 
finally Buck looked away. He 
tried to look wary as he did it, as 
if he was just fixing to make sure 
that nobody was around to sneak- 

THE DRAW 



shoot him — but you could see 
he'd been stared down. 

When he looked back at the 
little guy, he was scowling. 
"Who're you, mister?" he said. 
"I never seen you before." 

"My name is Jacob Pratt, sir. 
I'm just traveling through to San 
Francisco. I'm waiting for the 
evening stage." 

"Drummer?" 

"Excuse me? " 

For a second Buck's face got 
ugly. "You heard me, mister. 
You a drummer?" 

" I heard you, young man, but I 
don't quite understand. Do you 
mean, am I a musician? A per- 
former upon the drums?" 

"No, you goddam fool — I 
mean, what're you selling? Snake- 
bite medicine? Likker? Soap?" 

"Why— I'm not selling any- 
thing. I'm a professor, sir." 

"Well, I'll be damned." Buck 
looked at him a little more care- 
fullv. "A perfessor, huh? Of 
what?" 

"Of psychology, sir." 

"What's that?" 

"It's the study of man's be- 
havior—of the reasons why we 
act as we do." 

Buck laughed again, and it was 
more of a snarl. "Well, perfessor, 
you just stick around here then, 
and I'll show you some real rea- 
sons for people acting as they do! 
From now on, I'm the big reason 
in this town . . . they'll jump 
when I yell frog, or else!"

His hand was flat on the table 
in front of him — and suddenly 
his Peacemaker was in it, pointing 
at the professor's fourth vest but- 
ton. "See what I mean huh?" 

The little man blinked. " Indeed 
I do," he said, and stared at the 
gun as if hypnotized. Funny, 
though — he still didn't seem 
scared — just a lot interested. 

Sitting there and just listening, 
I thought about something else 
funny — how they were both just 
about of a size, Buck and the pro- 
fessor, and so strong in different 
ways: with the professor, you felt 
he was strong inside — a man who 
knew a lot, about things and 
about himself — while with Buck 
it was all on the outside, on the 
surface: he was just a milksop kid 
with a deadly sting. 

Buck was still looking at the 
professor, as carefully as he had 
before. He seemed to hesitate for 
a second, his mouth twisting. 
Then he said, "You're an eddi- 
cated man, ain't you? I mean, you 
studied a lot. Ain't that right?" 

"Yes, I suppose it is." 

"Well . . ." Again Buck seemed 
to hesitate. The gun in his hand 
lowered until the end of the barrel 
rested on the table. "Look," he 
said slowly, "maybe you can tell 
me how in hell . . ." 

When he didn't go on, the pro- 
fessor said, "Yes?" 

"Nothing." 

"You were going to say — ?" 



Buck looked at him, his bulging 
eyes narrowed, the gunman's 
smirk on his lips again. "Are you 
telling me what's true and what 
ain't," he said softly, "with my 
gun on you?" 

' ' Does ' the gun change any- 
thing?" 

Buck tapped the heavy barrel 
on the table. "I say it changes a 
hell of a lot of things." Tap went 
the barrel. "You wanta argue?" 

"Not with the gun," the pro- 
fessor said calmly. "It always 
wins. I'll talk with you, however, 
if you'll talk with your mouth 
instead of with the gun." 

By this time I was filled with 
admiration for the professor's 
guts, and fear that he'd get a bul- 
let in them ... I was all set to 
duck, in case Buck should lose his 
temper and start throwing lead. 

But suddenly Buck's gun was 
back in his holster. I saw the pro- 
fessor blink again in astonish- 
ment. 

"You know," Buck said, grin- 
ning loosely, "you got a lotta 
nerve, professor. Maybe you can 
tell me what I wanta know." 

He didn't look at the little man 
while he talked — he was glanc- 
ing around, being "wary" again. 
And grinning that grin at the same 
time. You could see he was off- 
balance — he was acting like 
everything was going on just like 
he wanted it; but actually the 
professor had beaten him again,

words against the gun, eyes against 
eyes. 

The professor's dark eyes were 
level on Buck's right now. "What 
is it you want to know?" 

"This — " Buck said, and his 
gun was in his hand again, and it 
was the first time when he did it 
that his face stayed sober and 
kind of stupid-looking, his normal 
expression, instead of getting wild 
and dangerous. "How — do you 
know how do I do it?" 



"Well," the professor said, 
"suppose you give me your an- 
swer first, if you have one. It 
might be the right one." 

" r — " Buck shook his head — 
"Well, it's like I think the gun 
into my hand. It happened the 
first time this morning. I was 
standing out in the Pass where I 
always practise drawing, and I 
was wishing I could draw faster'n 
anybody who ever lived — 1 was 





"Trinkets, beads — beads, trinkets! How about a bottle of gin once in awhile?" 



63 



wishing I could just get my gun 
outa leather in no time atall. 
And — " the gun was back in his 
holster in the blink of an eye — 
"that's how it happened. My gun 
was in my hand. Just like that. I 
didn't even reach for it — I was 
just getting set to draw, and had 
my hand out in front of me . . . 
and my gun was in my hand be- 
fore I knew what'd happened. 
God, I was so surprised I almost 
fell over!" 

"I see," said the professor 
slowly. "You think it into your 
hand?" 

"Yeah, kind of." • 

"Would you do it now, please? " 
And the professor leaned forward 
so he could Buck's holster, 
eyes intent. 

Buck's gun appeared in his 
hand. 

The professor let out a long 
breath. "Now think it back into 
its holster." 

It was there. 

"You did not move your arm 
either time," said the professor. 

"That's right," said Buck. 

"The gun was just suddenly in 
your hand instead of in your 
holster. And then it was back in 
the holster." 

"Right." 

"Telekinesis," said the pro- 
fessor, almost reverently. 
"Telewhat?" 

' ' Telekinesis — the moving of 
material objects by mental force." 
The professor leaned back and 

64 



studied the holstered gun. "It 
must be that. I hardly dared think 
it at first — the first time you did 
it. But the thought did occur to 
me. And now I'm virtually cer- 
tain!" 

"How do you say it?" 

' ' T-e-l-e-k-i-n-e-s-i-s. ' ' 

"Well, how do I do it?" 

"I can't answer that. Nobody 
knows. It's been the subject of 
many experiments, and there are 
many reported happenings - — but 
I've never heard of any instance 
even remotely as impressive as 
this." The professor leaned across 
the table again. "Can you do it 
with other things, young man?" 

"What other things?" 

"That bottle on the bar, for 
example." 

"Never tried." 

"Try." 

Buck stared at the bottle. 

It wavered. Just a little. Rocked, 
and settled back. 

Buck stared harder, eyes bulg- 
ing. 

The bottle shivered. That was 
all. 

"Hell," Buck said. "I can't 
seem to — to get ahold of it with 
my mind, like I can with my gun." 

"Try moving this glass on the 
table," the professor said. "It's 
smaller, and closer." 

Buck stared at the glass. It 
moved a fraction of an inch across 
the tabletop. No more. 

Buck snarled like a dog and 

 



swatted the glass with his hand, 
knocking it halfway across the 
room. 

"Possibly," the professor said, 
after a moment, "you can do it 
with your gun because you want 
to so very badly. The strength of 
your desire releases — or creates 
— whatever psychic forces are 
necessary to perform the act." 
He paused, looking thoughtful. 
"Young man, suppose you try to 
transport your gun to — say, to 
the top of the bar." 

"Why?" Buck asked suspi- 
ciously. 

" I want to see whether distance 
is a factor where the gun is con- 
cerned. Whether you can place 
the gun that far away from you, or 
whether the power operates only 
when you want your gun in your 
hand." 

"No," Buck said in an ugly 
voice. "Damn if I will. I'd maybe 
get my gun over there and not be 
able to get it back, and then 
you'd jump me — the two of you. 
I ain't minded to experiment 
around too much, thank you." 

"All right," the professor said, 
as if he didn't care. "The sugges- 
tion was purely in the scientific 
spirit — " 

"Sure," said Buck. "Sure. Just 
don't get any more scientific, or 
I'll experiment on how many holes 
you can get in you beTore you 
die." 

The professor sat back in his 
chair and looked Buck right in 



the eye. After a second, Buck 
looked away, scowling. 

Me, I hadn't said a word the 
whole while, and I wasn't talking 
now. 

"Wonder where that goddam 
yellow-bellied sheriff is?" Buck 
said. He looked out the window, 
then glanced sharply at me. "He 
said he'd come, huh?" 

"Yeah." When I was asked, I'd 
talk. 

We sat in silence for a few mo- 
ments. 

The professor said, "Young 
man, you wouldn't care to come 
with me to San Francisco, would 
you? I and my colleagues would 
be very grateful for the opportu- 
nity to investigate this strange gift 
of yours — we would even be 
willing to pay you for your time 
and -" 

Buck laughed. "Why, hell, I 
reckon I got bigger ideas'n that, 
mister! Real big ideas. There's no 
man alive I can't beat with a gun ! 
I'm going to take Billy the Kid 
. . . Hickock ... all of them! 
I'm going to get myself a rep 
bigger'n all theirs put together. 
Why, when I walk into a saloon, 
they'll hand me likker. I walk 
into a bank, they'll give me the 
place. No lawman from Canada 
to Mexico will even stay in the 
same town with me! Hell, what 
could you give me, you goddam 
little dude?" 

The professor shrugged. "Noth- 
ing that would satisfy you." 



THE DRAW 



65 



"That's right." Suddenly Buck 
stiffened, looking out the window. 
He got up, his bulging blue eyes 
staring down at us. "Randolph's 
coming down the street! You two 
just stay put, and maybe — just 
maybe — I'll let you live. Pro- 
fessor, I wanta talk to you some 
more about this telekinesis stuff. 
Maybe I can get even faster than I 
am, or control my bullets better at 
long range. So you be here, get 
that?" 

He turned and walked out the 
door. 

The professor said, "He's not 
sane." 

"Nutty as a locoed steer," I 
said. "Been that way for a long 
time. An ugly shrimp who hates 



everything — and now he's in the 
saddle holding the reins, and some 
people are due to get rode down." 
I looked curiously at him. "Look, 
professor — this telekinesis stuff 
— is all that on the level? " 
"Absolutely." 

"He just thinks his gun into 
his hand?" 
"Exactly." 

' 1 Faster than anyone could ever 
draw it?" 

"Inconceivably faster. The time 
element is almost non-existent." 

I got up, feeling worse than I'd 
ever felt in my life. "Come on," I 
said. "Let's see what happens." 

As if there was any doubt about 
what was bound to happen. 

We stepped out onto the porch 
and over to the rail. Behind us, I 





r Jilt

heard Menner come out too. I 
looked over my shoulder. He'd 
wrapped a towel around his head. 
Blood was leaking through it. He 
was looking at Buck, hating him 
clear through. 

The street was deserted except 
for Buck standing about twenty 
feet away, and, at the far end, 
Sheriff Ben Randolph coming 
slowly toward him, putting one 
foot ahead of the other in the 
dust. 

A few men were standing on 
porches, pressed back against the 
walls, mostly near doors. Nobody 
was sitting now — -they were 
ready to groundhog if lead started 
flying wild. 

"God damn it," I said in a low, 
savage voice. "Ben's too good a 
man to get kilt this way. By a 
punk kid with some crazy psy- 
chowhosis way of handling a 
gun." 

I felt the professor's level eyes 
on me, and turned to look at him. 

"Why," he said, "doesn't a 
group of you get together and 
face him down? Ten guns against 
his one. He'd have to surrender." 

"No, he wouldn't," I said. 
"That ain't the way it works. 
He'd just dare any of us to be the 
first to try and stop him — and 
none of us would take him up on 
it. A group like that don't mean 
anything — it'd be each man 
against Buck Tarrant, and none 
of us good enough." 



"I see," the professor said 
softly. 

"God ..." I clenched my 
fists so hard they hurt. "I wish 
we could think his gun right back 
into the holster or something!" 

Ben and Buck were about forty 
feet apart now. Ben was coming 
on steadily, his hand over his 
gunbutt. He was a good man with 
a gun, Ben — nobody around 
these parts had dared tackle him 
for a long time. But he was out- 
classed now, and he knew it. I 
guess he was just hoping that 
Buck's first shot or two wouldn't 
kill him, and that he could place a 
good one himself before Buck let 
loose any more. 

But Buck was a damn good 
shot. He just wouldn't miss. 

The professor was staring at 
Buck with a strange look in his 
eyes. 

"He should be stopped," he 
said. 

"Stop him, then," I said sourly. 

"After all," he mused, "if the 
ability to perform telekinesis lies 
dormant in all of us, and is re- 
leased by strong faith and desire 
to accomplish something that can 
be accomplished only by that 
means — then our desire to stop 
him might be able to counter his 
desire to — " 

"Damn you and your big 
words," f said bitterly. 

"It was your idea," the pro- 
fessor said, still looking at Buck. 
"What you said about thinking 



67 



his gun back into its holster — 
after all, we are two to his one — " 

I turned around and stared at 
him, really hearing him for the 
first time. "Yeah, that's right — 
I said that! My God ... do you 
think we could do it?" 

"We can try," he said. "We 
know it can be done, and evidently 
that is nine-tenths of the battle. 
He can do it, so we should be able 
to. We must want him not to 
more than he wants to." 

"Lord," I said, "I want him 
not to, all right . . ." 

Ben and Buck were about 
twenty feet apart now, and Ben 
stopped. 

His voice was tired when he 
said, "Any time, Buck." 

"You're a hell of a sheriff," 
Buck sneered. "You're a no-good 




"And now, Mr. Mafoogle, would you 
mind telling the court where you were 
— er, hatched?" 



bastard." \ 

"Cuss me out," Ben said. 
"Don't hurt me none. I'll be 
ready when you start talking with 
guns." 

"I'm ready now, beanpole," 
Buck grinned. "You draw first, 
huh?" 

" Think of his gun!" the profes- 
sor said in a fierce whisper. "Try 
to grab it with your mind — 
break his aim — pull it away from 
him — you know it can be done! 
Think, think — " 

Ben Randolph had never in 
anyone's knowledge drawn first 
against a man. But now he did, 
and I guess nobody could blame 
him. 

He slapped leather, his face 
already dead — and Buck's Peace- 
maker was in his hand — 

And me and the professor were 
standing like statues on the porch 
of the Once Again, thinking at 
that gun, glaring at it, fists 
clenched, our breath rasping in 
our throats. 

The gun appeared in Buck's 
hand, and wobbled just as he 
slipped hammer. The bullet 
sprayed dust at Ben's feet. 

Ben's gun was halfway out. 

Buck's gunbarrel pointed down 
at the ground, and he was trying 
to lift it so hard his hand got 
white. He drove a bullet into the 
dust at his own feet, and stared to 
whine. 

Ben's gun was up and aiming. 
Buck shot himself in the foot. 



68 



 



Then Ben shot him once in the 
right elbow, once in the right 
shoulder. Buck screamed and 
dropped his gun and threw out his 
arms, and Ben, who was a thor- 
ough man, put a bullet through 
his right hand, and another one on 
top of it. 

Buck sat in the dust and flapped 
blood all around, and bawled 
when we came to get him. 

The professor and I told Ben 
Randolph what had happened, 
and nobody else. I think he be- 
lieved us. 

Buck spent two weeks in the 
town jail, and then a year in the 
state pen for pulling on Randolph, 
and nobody's seen him now for 
six years. Don't know what hap- 
pened to him, or care much. I 
reckon he's working as a cowhand 
someplace — anyway, he sends 
his mother money now and then, 
so he must have tamed down 
some and growed up some too. 

While he was in the town jail, 
the professor talked to him a lot 
— the professor delayed his trip 
just to do it. 

One night he told me, "Tarrant 
can't do anything like that again. 
Not at all, even with his left hand. 
The gunfight destroyed his faith 
in his ability to do it — or most of 
it, anyway. And I finished the 
job, I guess, asking all my ques- 



tions. I guess you can't think too 
much about that sort of thing." 

The professor went on to San 
Francisco, where he's doing some 
interesting experiments. Or trying 
to. Because he has the memory of 
what happened that day — but, 
like Buck Tarrant, not the abil- 
ity to do anything like that any 
more. He wrote me a couple times, 
and it seems that ever since that 
time he's been absolutely unable 
to do any telekinesis. He's tried a 
thousand times and can't even 
move a feather. 

So he figures it was really me 
alone who saved Ben's life and 
stopped Buck in his tracks. 

I wonder. Maybe the professor 
just knows too much not to be 
some skeptical, even with what he 
saw. Maybe the way he looks at 
things and tries to find reasons for 
them gets in the way of his faith. 

Anyway, he wants me to come 
to San Francisco and get experi- 
mented on. Maybe someday I 
will. Might be fun, if I can find 
time off from my job. 

I got a lot of faith, you see. 
What I see, I believe. And when 
Ben retired last year, I took over 
his job as sheriff — because I'm 
the fastest man with a gun in 
these parts. Or, actually, in the 
world. Probably if I wasn't the 
peaceable type, I'd be famous or 
something.
