THE DOUBLE SPY By Dan T. Moore 

DEAR excellency: 

The communicating time will 
be here soon. I have started this 
letter early to be sure it will be 
ready. This is the first time I have 
felt safe when communicating 
with you. Our enemies at home 
can solve such extraordinarily 
complex ciphers that I have al- 
ways been uneasy before. They 
cannot possibly solve an entirely 
new language like this one; a 
language based on an utterly 
different theory from our own; 
with new symbols; and even set 
down with a different writing 
instrument. Our long periods of 
study together have brought their 
reward. Your Excellency, I ap- 
preciate the rare privilege of 
knowing a language that only 
one other person at home knows, 
and that one person, yourself. 

I am having many dangers and 
horrors in America. As we both 
realized, it is impossible to carry 
out my mission without lots of 



their money. I could not even 
begin my work, nor buy the 
expensive equipment needed for 
my experiments without finding 
a way to make money. 

In only a few weeks I dis- 
covered the quickest and easiest 
way to do it was to become an 
entertainer. The people here like 
to be shocked and astonished. 
Naturally I am well equipped to 
do both. I was an immediate 
sensation. I got into what New 
Yorkers call "The Big Time." 
. Each night at 8:30 I went to a 
theatre in a place called Times 
Square and put on my act. 
Thousands of people paid to see 
me. I was very well paid. There 
is a newspaper here called "Vari- 
ety." It carried an article about 
me. The headline said: STRONG 
MAN TERRIF WOW SOCK- 
EROO 100G 3D. The numbers 
at the end mean the theatre 
took in $100,000 during my third 
week. After the article appeared 
every seat was sold weeks in 
advance. 

You will be amused, Excellency, 
when you hear what I did in this 
show. I came out on the stage 
practically nude except for an ab- 
breviated leopard skin. I walked 
over to a pile of iron rods. They 
were half-inch concrete reinforc- 
ing bars about six feet long. I 
picked one out and dropped it 
on the floor. It made a terrible 
crash. This was to prove to the 
audience that it was real. Then 



I wrapped it around my neck and 
tied it in a regular four-in-hand 
necktie knot. It was a little hard 
to get the ends to come out even. 
I had to pull and haul to arrange 
them just right. This caused 
tremendous laughter. They knew 
no one could do this with an iron 
reinforcing bar. They were sure 
it was a trick. 

I chose the man in the audience 
who was laughing the loudest 
and asked him to come up on the 
stage. With a little persuasion he 
did so. I selected another iron 
bar and wrapped it around his 
neck. Then I tied it in a four-in- 
hand knot and adjusted the ends 
until they were perfect. I asked 
him to take the necktie off. He 
grabbed it with both hands and 
tried. His face turned purple with 
effort, but of course he could not 
even budge it. Everyone laughed 
loudly. Finally twenty men from 
the audience volunteered to help. 
They all started pulling and haul- 
ing. They couldn't get the iron 
necktie off. Then the audience 
became silent. They looked at 
each other uneasily. There were 
frightened whispers. 

That was the time to break 
the tension. I would spit on the 
floor. As my saliva hit the stage 
it burst into flames and a smell 
of perfume drifted through the 
theatre. It was my turn to look 
surprised and scared. Everyone 
howled with laughter, and the 



24 



 



tension was broken for all but 
the man with the iron necktie 
who remained forlorn and miser- 
able. Finally I removed his neck- 
tie and let it drop to the floor. 
It made a tremendous crash. 
Everyone was impressed all over 
again. 

Next I grasped a horizontal 
bar and chinned myself fifty 
times with one hand. Again every- 
one became silent. They all knew 
no one has ever done that before. 
In many ways they are like us. 
For example, when they get scared 
their body heat rises like ours. 
As the heat came up to me from 
the audience I could feel the 
change in my sensors. It made my 
chin warm. I found that when my 
chin got warm it was time to 
break the tension. I did it by 
demonstrating magic tricks. 

You will smile, Excellency, 
when you hear what they call 
magic here. I was tightly blind- 
folded. Some people came up 
on the stage, and I announced 
exactly how many there were. 
I pointed to exactly where each 
one was standing, and indicated 
which were males and which 
were females. This made a most 
tremendous impression. I could 
hear gasps in the audience. I 
was told that the people rubbed 
their eyes as if they could not 
believe what they were seeing. 
You will understand, Excellency, 
that I accomplished this by turn- 
ing on the male principle. The 

THE DOUBLE SPY 



women here are so exquisitely 
receptive to it that ' when it 
is on their excitement causes 
changes in their body heat. It 
was simple for me to sense those 
fluctuations in temperature and 
to know which of the people 
before me were female. 

Next I put a piece of paper 
on a metal rack across the stage. 
I concentrated heat waves on it 
from my cupped hand. The paper 
burst into flames. As they say 
here on the street they call Broad- 
way, that "brought down the 
house." They clapped and whis- 
tled and made me do it again 
and again. Luckily they con- 
ceived of it only as a wonderful 
trick. 

I ended the act by choosing a 
very unusual looking man from 
the audience. He came up on 
stage and we went behind a 
screen together. When we re- 
appeared a few seconds later the 
audience screamed because I had 
twisted my face around to look 
exactly like his. Believe me, the 
reaction was terrific. Slowly I 
let my face slip back to "normal." 
If they realized there is no normal 
and that I could leave my face 
that way permanently, that would 
have been too much of a shock. 
They would have become silent 
and terrified and suspicious. I 
might have been in danger. 

I had to calculate carefully how 
much these people could take 
without realizing there was some- 

25 



thing alarmingly different about 
me. I learned my lesson one 
night. I turned on the male 
principle too strongly and some 
of the women in the audience 
became very agitated. Everyone 
was embarrassed. After the show 
the theatre manager came to my 
dressing room and asked me to 
have a drink with him at a little 
bar across the street. 

When we sat down he stared 
at me in a queer manner. "Just 
exactly what happened tonight?" 
he demanded. 

I looked surprised. "Weren't 
you satisfied with the act?" I 
asked. "The audience seemed to 
like me." 

"They liked you too much." 

I laughed. "You mean those 
silly females who tried to drag me 
off the stage?" 

He narrowed his eyes and thrust 
his face close to mine. "If I 
hadn't had the best-trained ushers 
in New York there'd have been 
a panic and a riot in there. How 
come?" 

I shrugged. "The women in 
your town seem remarkably ex- 
citable." 

"And in your town?" 

"Not so," I declared truthfully. 
How truthfully Your Excellency 
well knows. 

"There's something peculiar 
about you," he said, "something 
very peculiar." He leaned back 
in his chair and his glance swept 



over me. "Suppose you cut out 
the leopard skin," he said, "and 
wear a jersey and trousers." 

I laughed to myself. He thought 
my bare body, my bulging muscles 
had been the cause of the trouble. 
What a fool! Is Your Excellency 
laughing too? However, I dared 
not disagree with him. By that 
time he had had many drinks. He 
was looking mean. He reached 
over and grabbed the lapel of my 
coat in his fist. 

"What the hell kind of a guy 
are you?" he snarled at me. 

My hands twitched. I wished 
I could have picked him up and 
tied him in a four-in-hand knot 
around his own neck. 

"Who the hell are you?" he 
repeated. 

I yawned and stretched and 
got to my feet. "Not even a strong 
man now," I said casually, "just 
a tired man." 

I left the bar. 

After that incident I was care- 
ful with the male principle. When 
the audience left each night I 
turned it on very slightly — only 
enough to be sure that the women 
would do their best to get back 
to see me again. 

But before I go any further in 
this account of my adventures, 
Your Excellency, let me tell you 
about the women here. The great- 
est difference between the Ameri- 
cans and ourselves is in the 
women. They are extraordinary. 
Some of them are beautiful be- 



26 



 



yond belief. My researches com- 
pletely confirm your much-cri- 
ticized hypotheses concerning our 
own women. If our enemies who 
object so strongly to Your Excel- 
lency's statements could be here 
for only one hour they would 
become your devoted supporters. 
American women are the proof 
that your theories are correct. 
Your famous attempt to explain 
some of the incongruous and 
apparently ridiculous passages in 
our ancient manuscripts by as- 
suming the existence of a now- 
vanished female principle is irre- 
futably demonstrated by these 
women, Your Excellency. 

Here, the female principle ex- 
ists, and as you predicted, most 
of the women are therefore en- 
tirely different from ours. The 
term used in this language is 
" femininity." It is a devastatingly 
attractive thing — but almost im- 
possible to explain. I will make an 
attempt. 

Senseless, reasonless, even fool^ 
ish motions of the body and the 
hands, the expressions of the eyes 
and the mouth, the way the head 
is moved and tilted are a part of 
it. So are unusual tones of the 
voice and special ways in which 
things are said. Laughter, a whis- 
per, the direction of the glance, 
the fingers' pressure — these, too, 
are parts of it. 

There are infinitely various 
types of adornment which hang 
on the body, fabrics in delicate 



or brilliant colors which cling 
and flow, gleaming stones at 
throat and wrists. The faces are 
enchantingly painted, the hair 
shining and arranged in numerous 
wonderful designs. There is an 
aura of the scent of flowers and 
fruits. 

I tell you, Excellency, every- 
thing about this femininity assails 
the senses. It is so potent that 
once having experienced it the 
mere recollection causes the pulses 
to pound and throb. My hand 
trembles as I write these words 
to you. I am confused and dis- 
turbed and wild with a longing 
I never knew at home. I wish 
to meet Your Excellency's high 
standards in preparing this re- 
port, and yet I am unable to be 
scientific. The logic of the labora- 
tory cannot be employed. 

As soon as I could I began to 
hunt desperately for the secret 
of the female principle. I analyzed 
the soil, the food, the water, 
and the air by our own most 
refined methods. I found nothing 
to help us. I went to the risky 
extreme of killing two of their 
women. One possessed an unusual 
amount of this femininity. The 
other, who seemed to have very 
little of it, was essentially like 
one of our own women. There 
was not the slightest chemical dif- 
ference in their bodies. Dead, they 
were precisely the same. But 
alive, Your Excellency, they were 
overwhelmingly dissimilar. 



THE DOUBLE SPY 



27 



I was able to kill the unfeminine 
one scientifically without emotion 
or regret. But, although it was 
clearly my duty, I could hardly 
bring myself to kill the other one. 
I had known her for several days. 
Her femininity almost prevented 
my continuing with the experi- 
ment. She told me that she loved 
me. 

I don't know if I have the 
skill to explain to you what this 
"love" is. Briefly, it means that 
the woman was in a mental state 
— a receptive mental state, Excel- 
lency, infinitely more violent than 
the peak our women reach after 
intensive application of the male 
principle. Your Excellency, she 
was that way all of the time. 

This brings me to another ex- 
traordinary difference between 
them and us. The men here lack 
the male principle. They obviously 
don't need it because of the 
existence of the female principle 
in the women. If the men had it, 
as we have, I leave it to Your 
Excellency's vivid imagination as 
to what would be happening here. 

In general the men are enough 
like us to be called humanoids in 
our sense of the word. They 
have about the same intelligence 
quotient that we have, and are 
physically almost identical except 
for our induced modifications. 
As Your Excellency predicted 
they do not have these since 
they have not yet discovered the 



methods of inducing them. As a 
result, while they have the same 
muscular potential as we do, 
they are far weaker, and their 
life span is not more than 70 
or 80 years by their calendar. 

They do not have heat sensors, 
so they stumble around in the 
dark and trip over things like 
children. They squander more 
energy on electric lights than on 
anything else in the economy. 
Also, their hearing and eyesight 
cannot be compared to ours. 
I am always hearing and seeing 
things without their suspecting 
it. A low conversation across the 
room is perfectly audible to me. 
Much of my best information 
comes this way. Naturally, since 
they completely lack heat genera- 
tors, they cannot set things on 
fire. 

To get back to the account of 
my activities, Excellency; my 
biggest mistake was in killing the 
two women for the femininity 
research. This got me into terrible 
trouble. They feel strongly about 
killing women here. Now that I 
appreciate their women, I can 
see why. 

The local police were not hard 
to handle, but they have a central 
police system called the F.B.I. 
It is comparable to Your Excel- 
lency's organization in techniques 
and training, and in some ways 
even superior to it. When the 
F.B.I, started investigating me, 
things got serious immediately. 



28 



 



One day my heat sensor de- 
tected a man standing outside 
my front door. He was a huge 
bulky man. I sensed a mass under 
his left arm pit. My heat sensor 
analyzed it. It reflected heat like 
iron, but there seemed to be some 
small pieces of lead there too. 

The man was polite and apolo- 
getic when I opened the door. He 
tipped his hat. He said that he 
had come to the wrong apartment. 
Then he asked, "How did you 
know I was standing outside the 
door?" 

Without thinking, I uttered 
the first thing that came into 
my head. "I saw your shadow." 

His eyes widened only slightly. 
He had good control of himself. 
"How could you see a shadow 
through a wooden door?" he 
asked softly. 

I was exasperated at my mis- 
take but I smiled the way people 
here do when they are at a dis- 
advantage. "I do not explain my 
tricks," I told him. "I earn my 
living by performing them at the 
theatre." 

I closed the door. 

The next night I was experi- 
menting with the male principle. 
I sat on a bench in a place called 
Central Park and practiced on 
the women as they went by. I 
discovered that the more feminine 
the women the greater the effect 
the wave has on them. Some 
would hesitate and look around 
as they walked by me. Some 



would stop and stare at me in a 
puzzled fashion. I was growing 
tired and ravenously hungry. I 
decided that when the next at- 
tractive woman passed me I 
would generate one last powerful 
wave, and then go on to a res- 
taurant. 

I allowed a few unfeminine 
ones to go by. Then I saw her, a 
lovely blonde girl about twenty- 
five years old. Her hair was a 
mass of short curls that covered 
her head with a uniform thickness 
like the styles in our Second 
Renaissance Period. She had on 
a black dress and was carrying a 
black bag in her hand. I sensed 
small pieces of different types 
of metals in her bag. She was 
walking slowly and weeping. Oc- 
casionally she dabbed at her nose 
with a piece of white cloth. 

She was so beautiful, Excel- 
lency. Her warmth started flowing 
over my chin when she was at 
least sixty feet away. I decided 
to wait until she was quite close 
and then to engulf her with the 
full force of the male principle. 
I was shaken and impatient. 
Even at the highest point of 
excitement, though, Your Excel- 
lency should know that the im- 
portance of my mission was in 
my mind. When she was on the 
sidewalk directly in front of me I 
did as I had planned. She stopped. 
Her handkerchief dropped to the 
ground, and then her bag. She 



THE DOUBLE SPY 



29 



looked at me wildly. She ran over 
and sat on the bench beside me. 
She put her arms around my neck 
and kissed me. 

"Why were you crying?" I 
asked. 

"I don't remember," she said. 
"I don't care." 

I closed my eyes. My senses 
were responding to her warmth 
and her scent. Suddenly there 
was a blast of male heat on my 
chin. I started and stared. There 
standing above us was the huge 
heavy man of the night before. 
The mass of metal was still under 
his left arm pit. He had an odd 
expression on his face. He was 
watching the girl as if her condi- 
tion was answering a question for 
him. 

In a sudden flash of intuition 
everything was clear to me. The 
girl was a decoy. I had fallen 
neatly into a trap. I had thought- 
lessly demonstrated my power to 
the F.B.I, man — a power I could 
not explain by saying it was a 
trick. 

I pushed the girl away and 
stood up. The man's eyes were 
fixed upon me with horror. I 
saw that he knew there was 
something monstrous and menac- 
ing about me. Something he did 
not understand. Something that 
meant terrible danger to him and 
his kind. His right hand started to 
creep towards the mass of metal 
under his arm. I cupped my 
hand towards him and started 



accumulating a heat charge. His 
glance dropped fearfully. It fell 
to my hand, and his temperature 
went up. He had undoubtedly 
seen me burn pieces of paper in 
the theatre. 

His right hand fumbled in his 
pocket and he drew out a little 
package. "Have a cigarette?" 

I shook my head. He put one 
in his own mouth and lighted 
a match. In spite of the strongest 
effort of my will I jumped back. 
I jerked my hand up over my 
chin. A little stick of wood with 
a flaring flame on the end of at 
least 600 degrees Centigrade, right 
in front of my heat sensors, took 
my breath away. The searing 
heat burned right into my brain. 
It was like some of the tortures 
in Your Excellency's Force Num- 
ber Five. 

The heavy man observed all of 
this, but he did not understand 
it. He looked at the girl, who 
had risen and was leaning against 
me, oblivious of everything. 

"You've got quite a way with 
women, haven't you?" he said. 
He dragged on his cigarette. The 
tip flamed up painfully. I shrank 
back and again brought my hand 
up to protect my chin. 

"What's the matter with you?" 
the man asked sharply. 

I did not know how to answer. 
I stood mute and waiting. 

"I want to go now, and I 
want to take that girl with me. 
Do you understand?" The man's 



30 



 



voice was harsh with anger. 

I shut the principle off. The 
girl lifted her head, but she 
appeared to be in a trance. The 
man took her arm and they 
walked off through the park. 
A murderous rage against the 
heavy man filled me. I cupped 
my hand. He was well within 
range ■ — but then I thought of 
my mission, Excellency, and let 
him go. For hours afterwards 
that lovely girl who was taken 
from me was in my thoughts. 

Your Excellency, two sugges- 
tions come out of this experience. 
They both concern our induced 
modifications. Any of us who 
come to America should be able 
to shut off the heat sensor at 
will. With everyone here smoking 
and lighting cigarettes and turn- 
ing on 300-watt light bulbs in 
one's face, with automobiles ap- 
proaching at night shooting out 
two searing heat beams in front 
of them, the environment is too 
full of shocks. It is too easy for 
us to be spotted because of this 
weakness. 

Also, Your Excellency, a change 
must be made in the connection 
between all of the induced modi- 
fications. When I accumulate a 
heat charge, that means that the 
male principle is automatically 
on. When I was accumulating a 
charge to kill the heavy man, 
the principle was affecting the 
woman, and she was reacting to 



it. The combination , was not 
desirable at that time. When I 
light the paper at the theatre, 
the male principle is also on, and 
affects the women in the audience. 
We can use the male principle 
without using the heat ray. Why 
can't we use the heat ray without 
using the male principle? This 
modification should be induced. 

The next afternoon there was 
a matinee performance at the 
theatre. It was crowded. The 
management had even provided 
for standing room at the back 
of the theatre. I started, as usual, 
by selecting an iron reinforcing 
bar and tying it into a four-in- 
hand around my neck. 

To my surprise, although it 
looked exactly the same, it was 
much harder to bend. I never did 
get the ends quite even. 

I had just put the second bar 
around the neck of the stooge 
from the audience when I noticed 
something queer. Although this 
was usually the place for hilarious 
laughter, everyone was silent. I 
looked out over the audience. A 
man was standing in the aisle, 
just a few feet from the stage. 
He was pointing a gun right at 
me. It was the heavy man. 

As I turned around he said, 
"Put up your hands." 

I put them up. 

He spoke in a loud, deep voice, 
"This is no gag, ladies and gentle- 
men. This man on the stage is 
the most dangerous and cold- 



THE DOUBLE SPY 



31 



blooded murderer in America. 
He is the murderer of Lydia 
Davis and Genevieve Scott." 

Several other men stood up. 
They all had masses of metal 
under their left arm pits. The 
heavy man gave them an order. 
"Go up on the stage and hand- 
cuff him. Use five pairs of hand- 
cuffs." 

Then he spoke to the audience. 
"Ladies and gentlemen, today 
we substituted tempered steel 
bars for the reinforcing bars. 
Twenty ordinary men couldn't 
have bent one of those bars. 
What you have witnessed was 
no trick. The man you see on 
the stage is not like us. He has 
the strength of at least forty 
men. Please remain in your seats. 
We can handle this situation." 

The audience gasped and mur- 
mured. A woman screamed. 

The group of men started walk- 
ing towards the stage. My hands 
were up. I cupped my right one 
and gave the heavy man a full 
charge of heat. His hair went up 
in a bright orange flame. He 
dropped the red hot gun from 
his smoking hand, and fell to the 
floor. He frantically rolled around 
the aisle trying to put out his 
flaming clothes. 

One of the other men shot at 
me. The little piece of lead came 
toward me, flew over my shoulder. 
It was going at about 900 feet 
per second. This was enough to 
kill me, Excellency. I became 



panic-stricken. I fled into the I 
wings. I was followed by a storm 
of little whistling lead pellets. 

The stagehands scattered hys- j 
terically before me as I ran down i 
the steps and out the stage door 
entrance. The street in front of 
the theatre was packed with police 
cruisers and athletic-looking men [ 
in blue uniforms. 

Before anyone saw me, I cupped I 
my hand, and fired the gas tank 
of the nearest police cruiser. The | 
ray of the male principle went j 
out with the heat ray. As I 
ran by the flaming car, all of the j 
women in the street felt some- 
thing important. They all turned 
and looked at me. 

Policemen started shooting. 
They piled out of their cars. 
The street was echoing with yells 
and shouts. I was terrified. I 
exerted an enormous effort of 
will and mustered every atom 
of energy at my command. I 
sent a full-power heat blast up 
the street. I have never mar- 
shalled a bigger blast, even in 
the contests at our training school 
in Area Twelve. 

Fifteen automobiles burst into 
flames. Twenty or thirty men and 
women fell screaming to the side- 
walk, their clothes burning. A 
flock of roasted pigeons fell smok- 
ing out of the sky. A black cloud 
condensed over the street, and 
a forked tongue of lightning 
flashed from it. Every woman 



32 



 



within a quarter of a mile felt 
the hot electrical force of the 
male principle. I dived into the 
Times Square subway entrance 
and sprinted down the stairs. 
There was a men's washroom at 
the end of the platform. 

I heard the wild tumult of 
pursuit behind me. I pushed open 
the door. A man was there wash- 
ing his hands. I strangled him, 
tore off his clothes, and put them 
on myself. Hastily, I twisted my 
face about so that I looked like 
an entirely different person. I 
opened the door and started walk- 
ing slowly back down the plat- 
form. 

A platoon of policemen with 
drawn guns was sprinting down 
the platform towards me. They 
were followed by a yelling mob 
of civilians which included hun- 
dreds of women. They swept by 
me. I was safe, but shivering 
with fear, Excellency. I was spent. 
I couldn't have mustered up a 
heat ray strong enough to warm 
the end of my nose. 

I stumbled around the corner 
and away from that neighbor- 
hood. Then I went into the first 
restaurant I saw, and gorged. 
After a five dollar plank steak, 
three glasses of milk, one glass 
of beer, and apple pie a la mode 
I was still ravenous; still energy- 
minus. 

I went a block up the street, 
into another restaurant, and 
bolted down exactly the same 



meal again. Strength started to 
flow slowly through my veins. 
After one more meal in still 
another restaurant, my confidence 
returned. 

The newspapers handled the 
affair with amazing restraint. The 
facts brought in by their reporters 
naturally sounded fantastic to 
the editors, so they rearranged 
them to "make sense." The reti- 
cence of the authorities, par- 
ticularly the F.B.I., helped to 
convert what might have caused 
a national panic into just an 
unusually spectacular chase after 
an escaped murderer. The burn- 
ing cars were laid to hooliganism 
on the part of the bystanders. 
The people who got burned, so 
the stories explained, were hurt 
by the gasoline explosions of 
the burning cars. The mass hys- 
teria of the women was caused 
by the excitement. The papers 
said that the steel necktie worn 
by my stooge at the theatre had 
to be cut off by a water-cooled 
electric saw. They said that how- 
ever I did it, it was a clever trick. 

The next few days, Your Ex- 
cellency, were the most difficult 
of my stay here. I knew that the 
full power of not only the F.B.I., 
but of the whole national govern- 
ment, would be concentrated to 
destroy me. I had to hide — hide, 
and get a new start. 

The money in the pockets of 
my borrowed suit didn't last long. 
I couldn't possibly risk presenting 



THE DOUBLE SPY

myself as a strong man or a 
magician again. I became a ditch 
digger and a day laborer, and 
finally drifted into the professional 
wrestling racket. Many of the 
top wrestling promoters live in 
Washington, D. C. I rented a 
little white clapboard house with 
green shutters, out in the country 
beyond Silver Springs, Maryland. 

I was careful to keep myself 
a second-rate wrestler. This was 
exasperating, Your Excellency. 
At any time I could have beaten 
three or four of their best wrestlers 
simultaneously. Everything was 
fixed so I won and lost when they 
told me to. We even practiced 
how we were going to win or 
lose before each match. I was very 
obedient and very scared. 

I did everything not to attract 
attention. I started to use the 
male principle again, but so spar- 
ingly that everything looked nat- 
ural. 

I tried to fit into the life of the 
community and become an Ameri- 
can. I joined a Bowling League. 
I learned to play a game called 
"Canasta." 

I got to be great friends with 
a man named Nat Brown, an 
automobile mechanic. He lived 
with his extraordinarily beautiful 
wife, Helene, in a house about 
a half mile away. 

The Browns used to ask me to 
dinner, and I would meet their 
friends. I grew very fond of them. 



We would sit around and drink 
beer and play cards and talk 
until late at night about politics 
and philosophy and love and 
everything else on earth. It was 
by far the swiftest part of my 
education in America, living with 
these lighthearted, charming peo- 
ple who obviously liked me. 

The only disadvantage was the 
problem raised by my increasing 
fondness for Helene Brown. She 
was a vivid incarnation of the 
female principle, and yet I knew 
I must not touch her. I had a 
constant battle with myself to 
maintain the disinterested rela- 
tionship necessary to continuing 
with these people without com- 
plication. 

Both Nat and Helene Brown 
used to come to see me wrestle 
whenever I had a match in Wash- 
ington. Whether I won or lost 
we would go out and drink beer 
together. I would sometimes bring 
another girl along. More and more 
I started to feel like a real 
native American. A couple of 
close friends, Excellency, did a 
lot for your humble servant. 

Three days ago I was riding 
along Connecticut Avenue in my 
new car. When I stopped for a 
light, I saw a familiar face in the 
crowd crossing the street. It was 
the tall heavy man, the F.B.I, 
agent who had tracked me down 
and tried to capture me in the 
theatre the night of the big 
battle. I could sense the mass of 



34 



 



metal carried under his left arm. 

He was hurrying along with 
another man. When I saw who 
it was my blood froze in my 
veins. It was my neighbor, Nat 
Brown. He also had a mass of 
metal under his left arm. 

It was clear to me then that, 
in spite of my precautions, the 
F.B.I, had spotted me weeks ago. 
How, I do not know. Nat Brown 
was their surveillance agent. 

I drove home immediately to 
finish this letter and get it off to 
you. I may not be alive tomorrow. 
The launching apparatus is con- 
cealed in a tool shed about a 
half a mile behind the house. I 
am going to put down my recom- 
mendations and get this off im- 
mediately — before it's too late. 

As I see it, Excellency, there 
are only four courses available 
to us: 

(1) A chemical or other isolation 
of the female principle, fol- 
lowed by an attempt to syn- 
thesize it at home to see 
what its effect would be on 
our women. This might save 
us. Unfortunately I have yet 
been able to isolate what 
causes the female principle 
here; so this is not a possibil- 
ity yet. 

(2) Kidnap some of their women. 
This would be delightful fun 
for Your Excellency and a 
few others; but it would 
not solve the main problem. 



Transportation difficulties 
would make it impossible to 
get enough of them. Also, 
if the basic element which 
creates the "female principle" 
is lacking because of some 
soil or other deficiency at 
home, their women would 
soon become like ours. All 
of our trouble would go for 
nothing, and our doom would 
continue to approach. 
(3) Conquer them, kill the men, 
take their women, and live 
with the women here. This, 
in my opinion, should not 
' be attempted for the follow- 
ing reasons. Americans are ex- 
traordinarily efficient in war- 
fare. They have atomic and 
hydrogen weapons, and they 
know how to use them. They 
are very warlike, although 
they constantly deny it. Some 
of their other weapons are 
fully equal to ours, in some 
respects, superior. Our com- 
munications would be far too 
long to enable us to prevail. 
This should be attempted 
only if the fourth alternative 
fails; and even then only after 
long expensive preparation. 
Also, there is distinct danger 
if we disclose ourselves by 
attacking them. They may 
find a way to attack us, and 
cause considerable damage. 
As things are now, with our 
vanishing birth rate, we can't 
afford to lose people in a war. 



THE DOUBLE SPY

(4) The fourth alternative is to 
breed ' their race out of ex- 
istence by planting our blood 
here — in other words, an 
invasion from within. This 
will depend upon our two 
races being inter-fertile. I am 
almost certain that they are. 
If I can stay alive for seven 
months longer I will give you 
a definite report. I will carry 
on the experiment as swiftly 
as possible. 
Since these people have such 
a short life span our descendants 
will live hundreds of years longer 
than theirs. The present race 
will slowly be bred out due to 
the infirmities of its men. Our 
men and their women will create 
a race superior to both. 

If I can find a way to escape 
from the F.B.I., and establish 
myself once more in safety I will 
try to justify Your Excellency's 
confidence in your humble serv- 
ant. 

I put the letter down on my 
desk. It certainly told most of 
the story. It needed only a final 
paragraph. Then I sat down at the 
typewriter and added it: 

I am closing now, Your Excel- 
lency. Tomorrow will be the 
transmission date for this letter. 
I may not communicate with 
you again for some time, but 
please understand, Excellency, 
that I am your humble and 
devoted servant and have tried 

36 



to carry on in strict accordance 
with your wishes. 

I put the letter into an envelope 
and put it in my pocket. Then I 
got into my car and drove down 
through the city to the northwest 
wing of the Department of Justice 
Building. The elevator girl smiled. 
"Haven't seen you for a long 
time, Nat. Don't you work for 
the F.B.I, any more?" 

I smiled back at her, "The 
Chief has had me up to a lot of 
out-of-town devilment." 

I passed Jack and Tex in the 
hall, and we waved to each other. 
They wanted to talk, but I was 
in too much of a hurry. "The 
Chief wants me," I said, without 
slowing down. 

When I reached the Chief's 
office Mrs. Sperling gave me a 
broad grin. "Hello, Nat. The 
Chief's been waiting for you." 

I went down the little corridor 
into the Chief's room. He was 
sitting at his desk looking grim 
and tense. On the wall behind 
him was a huge map of the 
United States. It had clumps of 
vari-colored pins all over it. His 
deep voice boomed across the 
room. 

"Hello, Nat. How is the Chief 
of the Venusian Desk?" 

"Well, if you want to know 
the truth, Chief, I'm pretty god 
damned relieved. Some jobs are 
fun. But my hair has been stand- 
ing on end so much since you 
gave me this job that it's going 

 



to need about a year's rest. No 
man wants his hair to have a 
nervous breakdown." 

The Chief looked at me fondly. 
"Well, I can't say you carried 
your mission out quietly. It prac- 
tically blew me out of bed, and 
I live at least ten miles away." 

"Joe did a hell of a good job 
with the TNT," I said. "How 
the hell he ever got twenty tons 
of it down in the basement in 
three hours I'll never find out." 

A slight frown came over the 
Chief's face. "Are you sure our 
Venusian friend was there?" 

"Absolutely." 

"How — absolutely?" 

"I called him on the telephone. 
When he answered I pressed the 
button. I heard the explosion 
over the wire, half a second before 
it practically tore down my own 
house. When I got over there a 
big crowd was collecting." I took 
a deep breath. "Not much for 
them to look at, though — just a 
big black smoking hole in the 
ground." 

"And our inter-planetary 
friend?" 

"Well, I don't know about his 
soul, Chief, but his body isn't 
around anywhere. I guess it just 
turned into steam with the rest 
of the house. A lot of women 
are going to be sad as hell." 

I saw the Chief's fists clenched 
on the desk. He was still taut 
from the strain of the last few 
hours. Finalry he reached for the 



silver cigarette box on his desk. 
His fingers jerked crazily as he 
put a cigarette in his mouth. 
He passed the box to me. I took 
one and started fumbling in my 
pockets for a match. The Chief 
snapped open the top of his big 
desk lighter, and held it over to 
me. I put the cigarette into the 
flame and drew deeply. The flame 
was at least three inches high. 
The Chief leaned forward, his 
eyes riveted on me. There was 
a queer, expectant look on his 
face. I stared back at him, puz- 
zled. Finally he snapped the 
lighter shut, and turned to the 
wall. "It's all right, boys," he 
said. 

A door with grillework along 
the front opened up. I saw Joe 
Evans and Tom Hardy and Jim 
Reid standing there with tommy 
guns, pointed right at my head. 

The Chief laughed at my ex- 
pression of bewilderment. 

"I wasn't taking any chances, 
Nat. You can't afford to in a situa- 
tion like this. No matter how 
sure you are, you can't gamble 
the whole future of your own 
world. I wanted to be damned 
certain that you really were Nat 
Brown, and not His Excellency's 
humble servant from the planet 
Venus. If you had flinched so 
much as one eyelash, Nat, when 
I held that lighter up to your 
face, three tommy guns would 
have opened up on you — all at 



THE DOUBLE SPY

one and the same time." 

I felt suddenly limp. I uttered 
a long audible whistle of relief. 

The Chief's voice was low and 
solemn. "Think what we've es- 
caped, Nat — think how close he 
came to getting loose on our 
world!" 

I took the letter out and threw 
it on his desk. "After you read 
this, Chief, you'll appreciate it a 
little more. The last paragraph is 
mine. I picked up the letter while 
the boys were loading the TNT 
down in the basement." 

While the Chief was reading 
the letter I got up and looked 
at the map of the United States 
behind him. Each of the colored 
pinheads had names printed on 
them. Grouped around Silver 
Springs, Maryland, were two pins. 
One was labeled "Chief." The 
other was labeled "Nat Brown." 
I turned to the Chief. "I wish 
you would do one thing for me." 

"I'll do anything for you." 

"Instead of calling us 'Chief 
and 'Nat Brown,' call us 'Excel- 
lency' and 'Your Humble Serv- 
ant.'" 

The Chief chuckled. "There 
has never been any humor on 
that board, and by God, it's 
high time there was." He rang 
the buzzer. "Mrs. Sperling, 
change the 'Chief and 'Nat 
Brown' pins to 'Excellency' and 
'Your Humble Servant.' " 

Her eyes widened a bit, but 



the labels were changed on the 
spot. 

When the Chief got to that 
part about the recommendations 
he read them out loud. Then he 
began to pace the room. 

"Nat," he said, "I'm going 
to see that you get some very 
special recognition for the job 
you have done. 1 mean recogni- 
tion from the White House itself. 
Of course we can't give it any 
publicity — at least not yet — 
but it will mean a lot more money 
for you." 

"Thanks, Chief, I can use it." 
"In your opinion, what should 
we do now, as our next step?" 
He paused. "Or should we just do 
nothing?" 

" I think we've got to be careful 
that they don't send anyone else 
down here. Or maybe it is 'up' 
here. We've got to get messages 
back to his 'Excellency' every 
once in a while from 'Your Hum- 
ble Servant.' 1 know how to do 
it now. The launching tube is 
still intact in its shed. There 
are ten rockets, so we can send 
at least ten messages. Time plays 
in our favor — since they have 
apparently lost the ability to 
reproduce themselves, they are 
dying out. If we can hold them 
off for a long enough period, 
we'll be safe forever. The most 
important thing, Chief, is to be 
sure we know it if they land any 
more 'humble servants' on the 
earth." 



38 



 



The Chief nodded approval. 
"How can we make sure we'll 
know it?" 

"It's hard to make absolutely 
sure, but why not send me out 
on a roving mission to set up an 
international organization to de- 
tect such a creature? What we 
want is information about any- 
one, anywhere, who is unusually 
strong or unusually attractive to 
women, or eats six or eights meals 
a day, or who has the other 
queer powers they have. I could 
get all the information coming 
in from all over the world, process 
it here, and only bother you when 
we found something suspicious." 

The Chief was enthusiastic. 
"You've thought yourself up a 
job, Nat. Take three weeks vaca- 
tion to get yourself rested up, 
and then get started." 

I walked down the long marble 
corridors away from the Chief's 
office, and went down in the 
elevator and out into the street. 
As I walked along in the crowds 
I felt the warmth of bodies as 
they passed me. I suddenly real- 
ized the novacaine was beginning 
to wear off. I didn't get out any 
too soon. My chin ached and 
throbbed. That hot searing flame 
had come so close . . . from now 
on my nightmares would be of 
that moment when the Chief 
was holding the lighter to my 
cigarette. But one thing sang 
through my being; the battle 



was won. In a month my world 
travels for the F.B.I, would start. 

Like a phoenix, I, the new Nat 
Brown, had risen re-born from 
the ashes of the Nat Brown 
vaporized by the explosion. What 
could his thoughts have been, 
lying tied up on the living room 
floor waiting for twenty tons of 
TNT to go off? Waiting, while 
I held the mirror in front of me 
and slowly made my face into an 
exact replica of his. He must 
have known then that I would 
get his job, and get his wife, 
Helene, and finally get his world. 
He realized then that His Excel- 
lency would send down hundreds 
more like me and that I would 
be the screen between them and 
the F.B.I., that I would instruct 
them and encourage them and 
give them aid and safety for their 
missions. 

As I neared the Cathedral I 
looked west on Massachusetts 
Avenue. The sun had just set 
and the Evening Star was hang- 
ing like a lantern in the sky — my 
homeland, the radiant planet 
which men on earth call Venus. 
Venus, they have told me, means 
love. What a superb and cosmic 
joke that is! I looked at the 
beautiful orb on the horizon and 
was filled with the triumphant 
excitement of being the earth- 
man, Nat Brown, of going home 
to my wife, Helene, one of the 
thousands who would breed thou- 
sands who would breed thousands.
