THE CUCKOO CLOCK BY WESLEY BAREFOOT 

Death wore the seeming of a 
battered Chevrolet. 
The child's scream and the 
screech of rubber on concrete 
knifed through two seconds of 
time before snapping, like a celery 
stalk of sound, into aching silence. 
The silence of limbo, called into 
being for the space of a slow 
heartbeat. Then the thud of run- 
ning feet, the rising hubbub of 
many voices. 
"Give her air!" 

"Keep back. Don't try to move 
her." 

"Somebody call an ambulance." 

"Yeah, and somebody call a 
cop, too." 

"1 couldn't help it." It was the 
driver of the ramshackle Chevvie. 
"She fell off the curb right in 
front of me. Honest to God, it 
wasn't my fault." 

"Got to report these things 
right away," said the grey haired 
man beside him. "No cause to 



worry if you ain't to blame." 

"Probably no brakes," said a 
heavily accented voice, and an- 
other spoke as if on cue, "Prob- 
ably no insurance, neither." 

"Let me through ! Oh, please — " 
The woman's voice was on the 
edge of hysteria. She came through 
the crowd like an automaton, not 
seeing the people she shoved and 
elbowed aside. 

"D.O.A.," said the woman 
heavily. Her face was no longer 
twisted with shock, and she was 
almost pretty again. "D.O.A. 
Dead on arrival, it means. Oh 
Jim, I never knew they said that." 
Suddenly there were tears in her 
blue eyes. There had been many 
tears, now. 

"Take it easy, Jean honey." 
Jim Blair hoisted his lank six feet 
out of the old rocker, and crossed 
the room, running a nervous hand 
through his cornshock hair. She's

only thirty, he thought, and I'm 
three years older. That's awfully 
young to have bred three kids and 
lost them. He took her in his arms. 
"I know how tough it is. It's bad 
enough for me, and probably 
worse for you. But at least we're 
sure they'll never be bomb fodder. 
And we still have Joanna." 

She twisted away from him, her 
voice suddenly bitter. "Don't 
give me that Pollyanna stuff, Jim. 
'Goody, goody, only a broken leg. 
It might have been your back.' 
There's no use trying to white- 
wash it. Our kids, our own kids, 
all gone. Dead." She began to sob. 
"I wish I were, too." 
"Jean, Jean — " 
"I don't care. I mean it. Every- 
thing bad has happened since 
Joanna came to live with us." 

"Darling, you can't blame the 
child for a series of accidents." 

"I know." She raised her tear- 
stained face. "But after all — 
Michael, drowned. Then Steve, 
falling off the water tower. Now 
it's Marian." Her fingers gripped 
his arm tightly. "Jim, each of 
them was playing alone with 
Joanna when it happened." 

"Accidents, just accidents," he 
said. It wasn't like Jean, this talk. 
Almost — His mind shied away 
from the word, and circled back. 
Almost paranoid. But Jean was 
stable, rational, always had been. 
Still, maybe a little chat with 
Doctor Holland would be a good 

120 



idea. Breakdowns do happen." 

They both turned at the slam- 
ming of the screen door. Then 
came the patter of childish feet on 
the kitchen linoleum, and Joanna 
burst into the room. 

"Mommy, I want to play with 
Marian. Why can't I play with 
Marian?" 

Jean put her arm around the 
girl's thin shoulder. "Darling, 
you won't be able to play with 
Marian for — quite a while. You 
mustn't worry about it now." 

"Mommy, she looked just like 
she was asleep, then they came and 
took her away." Her lips trem- 
bled. "I'm frightened, Mommy." 

Jim looked down at the dark 
eyes, misted now, the straight 
brown hair, and the little snub 
nose with its dusting of freckles. 
She's all we have left, poor kid, and 
riot even ours, really. Helen's baby. 

He looked up as the battered 
cuckoo clock on the mantel clicked 
warningly. "Time for little girls 
to be in bed, Joanna. Run along 
now like a good girl, and get 
washed." Even as he spoke .the 
miniature doors flew open and the 
caricature of a bird popped out, 
shrilly announcing the hour. It 
cuckooed eight times, then bounced 
back inside. Joanna watched en- 
tranced. 

"Bed time, darling," said Jean 
gently. "School tomorrow, re- 
member? And don't forget to 
brush your teeth." 

 



"I won't. Goodnight mommy, 
goodnight daddy." She turned up 
her face to be kissed, smiled at 
them, and was gone. They listened 
to her footsteps on the stairs. 

"Jim, I'm sorry about the 
things I said." Jean's voice was 
hesitant, a little ashamed. "It is 
hard, though, you know it is — 
Jim, aren't you listening? After 
all, you don't have to watch the 
clock now." Her smile was as 
. labored as the joke. 

He smiled back. "I think I'll 
take a walk, honey. Some fresh 
air would do me good." 

"Jim, don't go. I'd rather not 
be alone just now." 

"Well." He looked at her, keep- 
ing his expression blank. "All 
right, dear. How about some cof- 
fee? I could stand another cup." 
And he thought: Tomorrow I'll go. 
I'll talk to Holland tomorrow. 

"Let me get this straight, Jim." 
Holland's pudgy face was sober, 
his eyes serious. "You started out 
by thinking Jean was showing 
paranoid tendencies, and offhand 
I'm inclined to agree with you. 
Overnight you changed your mind 
and began thinking that maybe, 
just maybe, she might be right. 
Honestly, don't you suspect your 
own reasons for such a quick 
switch?" 

"Sure I do, Bob," Blair said 
worriedly. "Do you think I 
haven't beaten out my brains 
over it? I know the idea's mon- 

THE CUCKOO CLOCK 



strous. But just suppose there was 
a branch of humanity — if you 
could call it human — living off us 
unsuspected. A branch that knows 
how to eliminate — competition 
— almost by instinct." 

"Now hold on a minute, Jim. 
You've taken Jean's reaction to 
this last death, plus a random as- 
sociation with a cuckoo clock, and 
here you are with a perfectly wild 
hypothesis. You've always been 
rational and analytical, old man. 
Surely you can realize that a per- 
fectly normal urge to rationalize 
Jean's conclusions is making you 
concur with them against your 
better judgment." 
"Bob — " 

"I'm not through, Jim. Just 
consider how fantastic the whole 
idea is. Because of a series of acci- 
dents you can't accuse a child of 
planned murder. Nor can you fur- 
ther hypothesize that all orphans 
are changelings, imbued with an 
instinct to polish off their foster- 
siblings." 

"Not all orphans, Bob. Not 
planned murder, either. Take it 
easy. Just some of them. A few of 
them — different.- Growing up. 
Placing their young with well to 
do families somehow, and then 
dropping unobtrusively out of the 
picture. And the young growing 
up, and always the natural chil- 
dren dying off in one way or an- 
other. The changeling inherits, 
and the process is repeated, step 
by step. Can )'ou say it's impos- 

121 



sible? Do you know it's impos- 
sible?" 

"I wouldn't say impossible, 
Jim. But I would say that your 
thesis has a remarkably low index 
of probability. Why don't others 
suspect, besides you?" 

Jim spread his hands hope- 
lessly. "I don't know. Maybe 
they do. Maybe these creatures — 
if they do exist — have some 
means of protection we don't 
know about." 

"You need more than maybes, 
Jim. What about Joanna Sim- 
mons' mother? According to your 
theories she should have been 
well off. Was she?" 

"No, she wasn't," Jim admitted 
reluctantly. "She came here and 
took a job with my outfit. Said 
she was divorced, and had lived 
in New York. Then she quit to 
take a position in California, and 
we agreed to board Joanna until 
she got settled. Warrenburg was 
the town. She was killed there 
quite horribly, in a terrible auto 
accident." 

"Have you any reason for sus- 
pecting skulduggery? Honestly, 
Jim? Or for labelling her one of 
your human — er — cuckoos? " 

"Only my hunch. We had a 
newspaper clipping, and a letter 
from the coroner. We even sent 
the money for her funeral. But 
those things could be faked, Bob." 

"Give me some evidence that 
they were faked, and I'll be happy 
to reinspect your views." Holland 



levered his avoirdupois out of his 
chair. "In the meantime, relax. 
Take a trip if you can. Try not to 
worry." 

Jim grinned humorlessly. 
"Mustn^t let myself get excited, 
eh? Okay, Bob. But if I get hold 
of any evidence that I think you 
might accept, I'll be back. The 
last laugh and all that. Pending 
developments you take it easy, 
too. Don't let yourself get over- 
worked. Stay out of the sun. So 
long now." 

"So long, Jim." 

It was cool in the Warrenburg 
city hall, though outside the 
streets were sizzling. 

"Sorry, Mr. Blair," said the 
stout, motherly woman with the 
horn-rimmed glasses. "We've no 
record of a Helen Simmons. Noth- 
ing whatever." She closed the file 
with resolute finality. 

Jim stared at her. "Are you 
sure? There must be something. 
Mightn't there be a special file for 
accident cases? She was here in 
Warrenburg. She died here." 

The woman thinned her lips, 
shook her head. "If we had any 
information, it'd be right where 
I looked. There isn't a thing. 
Have you tried her last address? 
Maybe they could tell you some- 
thing. We can't." 

"I'll try that next. Thanks a 
lot." 

"Sorry we couldn't help you." 
He went out slowly. 



122 



 



872 Maple was a rambling 
frame house dozing on a wide 
flower bordered lot. There was 
nothing sleepy about the diminu- 
tive woman who opened the door 
to Jim's knock. Snapping black 
eyes peered at him from a maze of 
wrinkles. A veined hand moved 
swiftly to smooth down the white 
hair that framed her face. 

"Looking for someone, young 
man?" 

"Just information, Mrs. — " 

"Collins, and it's Miss. Don't 
give out information about guests. 
You a bill collector? " 

"No, Miss Collins. As a matter 
of fact, I'm trying to check up on 
an old friend I lost track of. Helen 
Simmons. She lived at this address 
for a while." 

"Sure did. Well, come on in.. 
Mind you, I don't usually do this, 
Mr.—" 

"Blair." Without any fanfare a 
bill changed hands. 

"Mr. Blair. Well, I can't tell 
you much. Try that green chair 
for size. What do you want to 
know?" 

Jim studied the toe of his right 
shoe. His eyes were veiled. "I 
heard she was hurt, and hard up, 
and I was worried. My wife and I 
were friends of hers back east." 

"Hurt, hard up? Humph! Not 
likely, spendin' all her time drivin' 
that English car around. Takin' 
trips. I'm not sayin' she didn't 
mind her manners, though." 



"Did she have any close 
friends?" 

"She was chummy with Edith 
Walton, the girl that works for 
Doc Mendel. He's county coroner 
in his spare time. No men. Didn't 
fool around at all. I'd a known." 

Behind Jim's stony eyes the 
pattern took clearer form, as if a 
mosaic approached completion. A 
mosaic of carefully planned events 
that totalled horror. He shivered 
as the outlines of his hunch filled 
in. Helen — what creatures were 
these? Helen — not dead, not 
poor, — carefully planting osten- 
sible proof of her death and going 
on to a new role, a new life, in 
London or Paris or Rome. A free, 
untrammelled life. And her child 

— if child was the word — in his 
home, repeating the pattern. 
Eliminating competition as her 
mother undoubtedly had done. 
The competition — his and Jean's 
children! Changeling, changeling 

— No, not that. Incubus! He 
shivered again. 

"Rabbits on your grave, Mr. 
Blair?" 

He looked up slowly. "Sorry. I 
was just wondering. Did Miss 
Simmons have a job while she was 
here?" 

"No, she didn't. One thing she 
did do was rent a place. Used to 
be Blands Hardware. Paid a 
month's rent, too. Said some 
friends of hers were plannin' to 
open a mortuary. Seemed like a

funny way for people to do busi- 
ness, but then, no affair of mine." 

Funny? No, not funny at all, 
but icily, eerily logical. There had 
to be an undertaking parlor where 
he could send the funeral ex- 
penses. He wondered if Helen had 
laughed when she opened the let- 
ter. Everyone his, or her, own 
undertaker. And the carefully 
cultivated friend in the coroner's 
office. For stationery. 

He got to his feet. "Thanks a 
lot, Miss Collins. You've been a 
great deal of help." He almost 
smiled as he asked, "I don't sup- 
pose she left a forwarding ad- 
dress?" 

The old head shook decisively. 
"Not a thing. Just packed and 
left, one Monday morning." 

All the loose ends tied up tight 
on a Monday morning. Nothing 
to cause suspicion. Nothing to 
worry about. Only a woman's al- 
most paranoid hysteria, — and a 
glance at a clock. Not very much 
to unmask — incubus. And what 
could he do? What could he do? 
Start talking and land in an insti- 
tution? Well, there was one thing. 

"Thanks again, Miss Collins." 

He went out. 

Swanson didn't look like the 
general conception of a small town 
newspaperman. One knew instinc- 
tively that his beard wouldn't 
have been tobacco-stained even if 
he'd cared to grow one. And he 
didn't have a bottle of bourbon in 



the file marked Miscellaneous, or 
if he did he didn't bring it out. 

"That never came from my 
paper," he said precisely. He 
handed the clipping back to Jim. 
"We don't use that type, for one 
thing. For another, Miss Sim- 
mons, so far as I know, wasn't 
killed here or anywhere else." 

"You knew her?" 

"I knew of her. I never met 
her." 

"What about this report of her 
death?" 

Swanson shrugged ; tented mani- 
cured fingers. "It's a hoax. Any 
job printing shop with a linotype 
could do it. In all likelihood it was 
some place in San Francisco. 
That's closest. It would be very 
difficult to check." His curiosity 
was showing. 

"I see. Well, thanks for your 
time and trouble, Mr. Swanson." 

"Not at all. Sorry I couldn't be 
of more help." 

One thing to do. One thing that 
must be done. 

Motors over the mountains. 
And riding with them, the numb 
resolve. Motors over the salt pans, 
the wheat lands, the corn belt. 

The stewardess stops again. 
"Coffee, sir? A sandwich, per- 
haps?" 

"I beg your — Oh no. No 
thanks." 

She watches him covertly, un- 
easily, longing for the end of the 
run. 

Motors in the night.

And the dull determination 
growing, strengthening. 

The airport, baggage, the an- 
cient taxi with the piston slap, 
and at last the dark, familiar 
street. 

"Jim, you're back! Oh Jim, 
darling. Next time they send you 
west I'm going too. I am!" 

"Okay Jean, sure. Why not?" 

"What's the matter, dear? Oh, 
you're tired, of course. I should 
have known. Sit down, Jim. Let 
me get you a drink." 

"In a minute, Jean." Do it 
now now NOW! "Where's Jo- 
anna?" 

"She's in bed. Hours ago. Jim, 
has something — ?" 

"Nothing, dear. I just want to 
look in on her. And freshen up a 
bit, of course." 

"Jim — " 

He smoothed away the worried 
frown with his forefinger. 

"In a minute, dear." 

She smiled uncertainly. "Hurry 
back, Jim." 

The stairs unwind irrevocably, 
slow motion in a nightmare. The 
bedroom door opens, the hall light 
dim on the bed and the child's 
face. Incubus in the half dark. 

For a moment Jim remembered 
wondering somewhere, sometime, 
what strange powers of protection 
might be implicit in such a crea- 
ture. As the thought came into his 
mind, Joanna stirred. She opened 
her eyes and looked at him. 



He took one step toward the 
bed. 

The little girl eyes over their 
dusting of freckles slitted. Then 
they opened wide, became two 
glowing golden lakes that grew, 
and grew — 

There was the feeling of a great 
soundless explosion in his mind. 
Waves of cool burning in his 
brain, churning and bubbling in 
every unknown corner, every 
cranny. Here and there a cell, or 
a group of cells, blanked out, the 
complex molecules reverting, be- 
coming new again. Ready for fresh 
punch marks. Synapses shorted 
with soundless cold fire, and 
waited in timeless stasis for re- 
channelling. The waves frothed, 
became ripples, were gone. He 
stood unmoving. 

What was it he was supposed 
to do? Let's see — Tuck Joanna's 
blanket around her. But she was 
covered up snugly. Sleeping soundly, 
too, and for a few seconds he'd 
thought she was awake. And Jean 
was waiting downstairs, Jean and 
a cool drink. 

Oh yes, stop in the bathroom. 
The stairs wind up again. It is 
good to be with one's family, re- 
laxed in the well known chair. Not 
a worry in the world. 

He sat there, his mind at ease, 
not caring much about anything. 
He didn't even look up when the 
clock on the mantel whirred, and 
the ridiculous bird popped out of 
its nest to herald a new day.
