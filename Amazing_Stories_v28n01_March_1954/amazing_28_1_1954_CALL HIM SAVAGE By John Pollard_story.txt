CALL HIM SAVAGE By John Pollard

Soft lips brushed the back of 
my neck and she said something. 
"That's fine," I said. 
"Sam!" 

I heard that, all right. I looked 
up from the typewriter. "Hey, 
that's a nice nightgown!" 

"I said I think I'm getting a 
cold." 

"Well — with a nightgown like 
that ..." 

"Silly!" Her smile would have 
corrupted a bishop. "You coming 
to bed? It's almost midnight." 

"Soon's I finish writing this 
chapter. Best thing I've ever 
done." 

"More Indians?" 

I reached for a cigarette. "Sure, 
more Indians. What else would 
one of the country's leading au- 
thorities on the original Ameri- 
cans be writing about? I hate to 
keep harping on the same subject, 
my sweet, but the dough from 
my last book bought you that 
mink stole you keep dangling in 
front of your girl friends." 

"If you make so much money 
at it, why are you still a re- 
porter?" 

"I like being a reporter." 

"What about me? Between re- 
porting and Indians my love life 
is beginning to wither on the 
vine. You should have married a 
squaw." 

"Who says I didn't?" I gave 
her my best leer and reached out 
an exploring hand. She blushed 
and backed away, laughing. "Noth- 



ing doing, Sam Quinlan! You 
want me I'll be in bed." 
"Hey-hey!" 

She gave me a quick kiss, 
evaded my grasp and disappeared 
into the bedroom. I finished light- 
ing the cigarette, typed a few 
more lines. But my working mood 
was gone, a casualty of a black 
lace nightgown. Finally I got up 
up from the desk and snapped on 
the radio and, while it warmed 
up, strolled over to the living 
room window. 

At this hour Washington was 
largely in bed. Away over to the 
east I could see the dim glow of 
lights marking the Mall, with the 
Capitol dome beyond that. Now 
that communism was dead, buried 
and unmourned in Russia and her 
satellites, with peace and pros- 
perity booming from Iowa to 
Iran, even the President would 
be sleeping like a baby. Any day 
now I would be down to covering 
PTA meetings for the Herald- 
Telegram^ That was okay with 
me; my big interest was "Saga 
of the Sioux" — the third in the 
series of books I was writing on 
the history of the American 
Indian. 

An early autumn breeze crawled 
in at the open window and moved 
the line of smoke from my ciga- 
rette. A quiet serene night, with 
the faint smell of burned leaves 
in the air and the promise of a 
cool, sunny, peaceful tomorrow.

A lovely night, made far lovelier 
by the thought of the beautiful 
blonde waiting for me in the next 
room. After twelve years of mar- 
riage I still found her to be the 
most exciting and rewarding 
woman I had ever known. 

"... most of eastern Colo- 
rado," the radio said suddenly, 
"as well as the western fringes of 
Nebraska and Kansas." 

I turned the volume down. 
Weather report, probably, except 
that the announcer was making it 
sound like a declaration of war or 
a "sincere" commercial. 

"We repeat," the voice con- 
tinued, " since 8:10 this evening, 
Eastern Standard Time, literally 
nothing has come out of that 
section of the country. All com- 
munication has ceased, outbound 
trains and planes are long over- 
due, highway traffic out of the 
area has stalled." 

"Sam?" 

"Yeah?" 

"You coming to bed?" 

"... tuned to this station for 
further bulletins con — " 

I clicked the set off. "Could I 
have three minutes for a fast 
shower?" 

"Umm ... I guess so." 

"I," I told her, "am coming to 
bed." 

Lois rattled the handle of the 
stall-shower door, and I shut off 
the water. "Yeah?" 

"Telephone, darling." 



"At this hour? Who is it?" 

"Sounds like Purcell." 

"For Crisake!" I came out and 
grabbed a towel. "This is worse 
than one of those Hollywood 
farces about honeymooners. What's 
he want?" 

"I didn't dare ask him, he 
sounded so grumpy." 

I kissed her. "About that night- 
gown . . ." 

"You're getting me all wet!" 

Purcell was night Editor at the 
Herald-Telegram, a small, intense, 
middle-aged, highly literate man. 
Years before, his wife had run off 
with a reporter, leaving Purcell 
with an undying hatred for all 
members of the profession. 

His voice, over the wire, cracked 
like a whip. "Sam?" 

"Listen, I'm off duty. You got 
any idea what time — " 

"You're wanted at the White 
House. Now." 

"The White House? You 
mean — ?" 

"The White House. The Presi- 
dent wants to see you." 

"The President! Cut out the 
gags, will you? I'm in no — " 

"I don't kid with reporters, 
Sam. On your way." 

The phone went dead. I stood 
there staring stupidly at the re- 
ceiver. Lois had to shake my arm 
to get my attention. "What did 
he want?" 

"The President wants to see 
me."

"You're joking!" 

"Hunh-uh. Anybody but Pete 
Purcell, I'd agree." I put back the 
receiver and went over to the 
dresser for clean underwear. "Get 
back to bed, honey. I'll be home 
as soon as I get through running 
the Government. Can you imag- 
ine! The President wants to see 
me!" 

She yawned and stretched, look- 
ing like the June page on an 
Esquire calendar. "Well, so much 
for my sheerest nightgown." 

"Believe me, darling, if it 
wasn't the President — " 

"I know. It would be an In- 
dian." 

I finished dressing while she sat 
on the bed with her knees drawn 
up to her chin, watching me. I 
kissed her thoroughly and patted 
her here and there and went 
downstairs. The night man in the 
garage under the building put 
down his Racing Form and dug 
my Plymouth out of a welter of 
chrome and glass. 

I drove much too fast all the way. 

A guard at the gate looked at 
my press pass and used a hidden 
telephone. Within not much more 
than seconds 1 was ushered into 
the Press Secretary's office. The 
Secretary, a badly shaken man if 
ever I'd seen one, had evidently 
been pacing the floor. He looked 
at me sharply out of pale, blood- 
shot eyes. "Your name Quin- 
lan?" 



"Yes, sir." 

" May I see your identification? " 

I handed him my wallet. He 
flipped through the panels holding 
my press pass, social security 
card, driver's license and a picture 
of Lois in a bathing suit. When he 
failed to do more than give the 
latter a casual glance I knew this 
was a man with a troubled mind. 

I said, "Maybe you could give 
me kind of a hint on what's going 
on." 

"Going on?" he repeated ab- 
sently. 

"You know — -going on." I got 
off a nonchalant-type laugh that 
would have fooled anybody who 
was deaf. "I even heard that the 
President wanted to see me!" 

He gave me back the wallet. 
"Ah — yes. Come with me, please." 

We left the office and went 
down a hall, around some corners 
and down more halls, past a lot 
of doors, all of them closed. Fi- 
nally he stopped in front of a 
pair of doors with shiny brass 
doorknobs, knocked twice, then 
turned the knob, said, "Mr. 
Quinlan, gentlemen," shoved me 
through with a jerk of his chin, 
and closed the door behind me. 

I never saw him again. 

There was a long table down 
the center of a long narrow room. 
The woodwork was white and the 
walls papered a dark green, with 
walnut-framed pictures here and 
there of the kind of men you see 
in albums of Civil War vintage. 



94 



 



But the men around the table 
were as modern as a jet bomber. 
There were five of them, three of 
whom I recognized on sight: 
Army Chief of Staff General Lu- 
cius Ohlmsted, Secretary of War 
Franklin McClave, and, seated at 
the far end of the table and look- 
ing even younger than his forty- 
nine years, the President of the 
United States. 

The remaining two were just a 
couple of men to me: dark busi- 
ness suits, clean collars, mani- 
cured fingernails and the type of 
faces you see twenty of on any 
city block. 

I walked on down the room, 
feeling as conspicuous as a cheer 
leader at a wake, while five pairs 
of eyes sorted me over molecule 
by molecule. When I reached 
the near end of the table, I stopped, 
resisted an impulse to salute, and 
stood there at attention. 

The President managed to keep 
from smiling, although you could 
see he wasn't far from it. "Thanks 
for coming here so promptly, Mr. 
Quinlan. I'd like you to meet my 
associates." 

He reeled off names and titles. 
The two strangers were a Mr. 
Proudfit and a Mr. Kramer, 
occupations not disclosed. Kramer 
was small and ageless, with a 
weather-beaten face and a mouth 
like a steel trap; while Mr. 
Proudfit had the look of a benign 
monk, until you saw the tempered 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



steel glint in his piercing eyes. 

When introductions were com- 
pleted, I said, "How do you do?" 
once, including them all, and 
went on waiting. Nobody sug- 
gested I sit down, probably be- 
cause there were only five chairs 
around the table to begin with 
and the room's two couches were 
too far away to keep me in the 
group. The President gave me 
the same winning smile that had 
pulled a couple million extra 
votes his way in the last election, 
and said, "Let me start off, Mr. 
Quinlan, by telling you that 
we've got a problem on our hands 

— one that may very well involve 
the peace and well-being of the 
entire country. The details are 
going to strain your credulity 
beyond human limits, I'm afraid 

— just as they have ours. But 
there is enough supporting evi- 
dence to what we've heard for us 
to do something about it. And 
that's where you come in." 

He paused, evidently waiting 
for a response from me. There was 
only one response I could make 

— even though I hadn't the slight- 
est idea what he was talking 
about. "I'm at your service, Mr. 
President." 

His smile was a medal for my 
chest. "Thank you. At this point 
I'd better let Mr. Kramer take 
over." 

Kramer leaned back in his 
chair, placed the tips of his fin- 
gers together and stared search- 

95 



ingly at me over them. His voice, 
when he spoke, was as dry as his 
skin. "Mr. — ah — Quinlan, I 
understand you were born thirty- 
one years ago on a Potawatomi 
Indian reservation in the state of 
Michigan." 

I blinked. "That's right. Not 
many people know it." 

"You are part Indian, I be- 
lieve?" 

"One quarter Potawatomi." 

"Also, I'm told that you are 
something of an authority on the 
history of the American Indian." 

"I've written books on the sub- 
ject and expect to write a good 
many more." 

"You speak the language?" 

"What language?" 

He floundered a little. "Why — 
ah — the — ■ ah — > Indian lan- 
guage." 

"Look, Mr. Kramer," I said, 
"there are scores of Indian lan- 
guages. Nobody in history, red 
man or white, could ever speak 
all of them. Fortunately most 
Indians belonged to one of sev- 
eral great families, and the lan- 
guage of each family was close 
enough for the tribes in that 
family to understand each other. 
I can handle the language of the 
Algonkin like a native, being part 
Potawatomi myself. I can get by 
in the tongue of the Iroquois, the 
Caddoan, the Siouan, and the 
Muskhogean. The Dene and Uto- 
Aztecan would give me consider- 



able trouble, while the Penutian 
would be just about a blank." 

I stopped there, and shrugged. 
"Sorry. I didn't mean to turn 
this into a lecture." 

Kramer[s weathered face stayed 
expressionless. "Are you familiar 
with the customs of Indians of, 
say, two hundred years ago?" 

"With their customs, clothing, 
religions, food, taboos, cultures, 
weapons, or anything else you can 
think of." 

Franklin McClave, the Secre- 
tary of War, cut in on us at this 
point. "I think, Bob," he said to 
Kramer, "that Mr. Quinlan quali- 
fies for the job." His glanced 
turned to me. "I'd like for you to 
meet a man waiting in the next 
room, Quinlan. I want you to 
hear his story, talk to him, ask 
him questions, then give us your 
opinion of the results. Do you 
mind?" 

I spread my hands. "Whatever 
you say." 

Kramer got to his feet and went 
over to a side door. He pushed it 
open, said something I didn't 
hear, then stepped rather quickly 
out of the way. 

A moment later young Daniel 
Boone came out! 

Of course, it wasn't really Dan- 
iel Boon at all. Leaving out the 
fact that the "dark and bloody 
ground" frontiersman had been 
dead nearly a hundred and fifty 
years, this man was a lot hand- 



96 



 



somer, with entirely different 
features. But he was wearing the 
fringed buckskin trousers and 
shirt, the beaded moccasins, the 
coonskin cap, and his coarse 
black hair hung almost to his 
shoulders. A powderhorn swung 
from his neck by a greasy cord, 
and he was holding on to a six- 
foot muzzle-loader as though it 
were his only contact with reality. 

I stood there with my chin two 
inches from the rug and gawked 
at him. He was scared to death. 
His deep-set brown eyes rolled 
fearfully from side to side, with 
too much white showing around 
the irises. His clutch on the gun 
grew even tighter, whitening the 
knuckles of his hand. 

Muscles crawled on my scalp. 
A strange tension seemed to fill 
the room. Kramer cleared his 
throat. "This man's name is 
Enoch Wetzel, Mr. Quinlan. I 
want him to tell you exactly what 
he told us earlier tonight." 

I felt the tendons in my legs 
tighten, pulling me into a slight 
crouch. I was back a hundred and 
seventy years in the past, with a 
dull anger starting to move around 
in me. "Wetzel," I said, making 
it sound like a dirty word. "Any 
relation to Lewis Wetzel?" 

The young man's eye.s widened 
with astonishment and obvious 
relief. "Well, now, I reckon so! 
Lew's my uncle." 

"Lew Wetzel," I said between 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



my teeth, "is a low, stinking, 
murdering skunk!" 

I ducked just in time to keep 
from being brained by the swing- 
ing stock of the long gun. I came 
up under it quicker than I'd ever 
moved before in my life and 
nailed him on the jaw with a solid 
right, getting my shoulder behind 
it. It was like hitting the Hall of 
Justice. He grunted and up came 
the rifle butt for another try. 

Suddenly the room was bulging 
with strangers. A dozen arms 
folded around the young man, the 
gun was ripped from his fingers 
and he hit the rug with a thump 
that shook the room. The buck- 
skin-covered legs threshed briefly, 
then were still. 

I moistened my lips and backed 
away as sanity returned. I looked 
at the frozen faces around the 
table. "My fault, Mr. President. 
I can't blame you for thinking I'm 
as crazy as he is. But, as Mr. 
Kramer mentioned, I'm part In- 
dian. Back in the seventeen hun- 
dreds a frontiersman named Lewis 
Wetzel murdered a lot of Indians 
— men, women and children. I 
suppose you might say I went ata- 
vistic, or something, at hearing 
this fellow claim he was Wetzel's 
nephew. He's a screwball, of 
course, and I owe you a good 
solid apology for starting a ruckus." 

The President wasn't smiling 
now. "Perhaps I should have told 
you before, Mr. Quinlan, we may 
desperately need this young man's 

97 



assistance in the near future." 

I almost blurted out the wrong 
thing, but bit my lip instead and 
remained silent. The President's 
eyes swung to the heap of hu- 
manity on the floor. "Let him up, 
boys. I'll call you if I need you 
again." 

The six Secret Service men rose 
and stood Enoch Wetzel on his 
feet, then returned to the adjoin- 
ing office, not looking too happy 
about leaving a madman with the 
Chief Executive. Wetzel pushed 
the long hair off his forehead 
and stood there glowering at me, 
spots of angry color in his dark 
cheeks. 

I said, "Forget it, Mac. I made 
a small mistake." 

His thin lips peeled back in a 
snarl. "Half breed!" 

I took it, although nothing was 
ever harder for me to do. Kramer 
hurriedly stepped into the breach. 
"Mr. — ah — Wetzel, we're wait- 
ing for you to repeat what you 
told us before." 

The tall, broad-shouldered 
young man turned from me to face 
the long table. There was a grace- 
ful dignity about him, in his 
posture, in the way he held his 
head, that you don't see often. 
Again I felt the hair move along 
my scalp. For a guy who was as 
nutty as peanut brittle, he was 
certainly convincing in his role 
of frontiersman. Turn back the 
clock far enough and this could 
have been one of General An- 



thony Wayne's scouts at the bat- 
tle of Fallen Timbers. He even 
swelled the part. 

"My father got hisself put on 
by General Harmer as a scout a 
fortnight back. The General, on 
orders from President Washing- 
ton, was to lead his sojers to the 
north after the Injuns up there. 
Pop allowed as I was ready to 
try my luck agin the abbregynes, 
so he took me along. 

"Three-four nights after we 
set out ahead the rest, Pop an' 
me come onto fresh Injun signs. 
We move powerful careful through 
the woods an' right soon we catch 
sight of camp fires. There's a 
whole grist of them red devils 
prancin' around, all fixed out in 
war paint — more of 'em as I 
ever see'd afore. Even Pop allows 
as how it bugs out his eyes — and 
Pop's a man to do an amount of 
travelin'." 

It was a page torn out of techni- 
color nightmare: three of the 
world's most important men hang- 
ing onto the words of a madman 
who claimed to be an Eighteenth 
Century Indian scout in the em- 
ploy of one of George Washing- 
ton's generals. Yet the man's 
every word, every gesture, every- 
thing he wore, was as authentic to 
that period as the powder horn 
around his neck. 

"We draw back in the woods 
aways an' wait. It's gettin' along 
to'ard sun-up, an' Pop says he 



98 



 



aims to get a better idea how 
many Injuns they is, an' what 
tribes. Most of the braves got nice 
new British guns an' General 
Harmer'll want to know about 
that." 

Wetzel's voice began to shake 
a little, remembering. "Pop an' 
me are hidin' in a clump of sumac 
when this here sudden racket 
starts up, equal to a hundred 
waterfalls goin' all at oncet. We 
look up in the air where it's 
comin' from, and holy hokey if 
fallin' right out of the sky ain't 
this round iron thing! Flat as a 
hoe-cake an' big around as an 
acre of land, with the fires of Hell 
breathin' at its edges! 

"Well sir, them Injuns lit a 
shuck out of there like the spirits 
was after them. My legs were 
tryin' to run, too. But Pop takes 
a holt on my arm an' says, 'By 
Janey, I aim to see this if'en I 
swing for it!' 

"It drops down," Wetzel con- 
tinued, demonstrating with a slow 
graceful movement of his hand, 
"lookin' no less than a big shiny 
stove-lid, an' settles in the clearin' 
as light an' easy as the feather 
off'en a duck's back. It stands 
high as a Pennsylvany school 
house an' twicet the size around, 
an' no sound from it at all." 

He stood slim and straight as a 
Shawnee arrow, smooth-faced and 
solemn, obviously not much past 
his twentieth birthday, yet by 



his own account born before the 
Declaration of Independence was 
on paper. He went on talking, 
sounding like a character out of 
James Fenimore Cooper. His story, 
boiled down and translated, came 
out something like this: 

The sudden arrival of the strange 
object had literally paralyzed the 
Indian encampment. The war- 
riors dropped their weapons and 
called on the spirits to protect 
them, while a hole opened in the 
side of what couldn't be anything 
else but a spaceship. Then out 
of the opening came huge steel 
caricatures of men. There were 
over a dozen of these robots, each 
the height of two men, and their 
eyes were strange round circles of 
faceted glass. In single file they 
moved down the ramp and stalked 
through the ranks of fear-frozen 
Indians, disappearing into the 
forest. 

Enoch's father ordered his son 
to crawl up into a tree out of 
sight, then shouldered his rifle 
and slipped away through the 
bushes to get a better look at 
what was going on. Enoch "al- 
lowed" that his Pop was a 
"moughty" brave man, and none 
of his audience gave him an 
argument on that score. 

From his place among the 
leaves, Enoch watched his father 
melt into the trees. The sun was 
above the horizon by this time 
and the young frontiersman dis- 
covered that his present position 



CALL HIM SAVAGE 



99 



was the equivalent of a box seat 
on the fifty-yard line. 

The next figure to emerge from 
the spaceship brought an amazed 
murmur from hundreds of throats. 
No twelve-foot robot this time, 
no alien monster beyond descrip- 
tion. Very simply,' this was an 
Indian. 

Yet what an Indian! He stood 
on the ramp, wearing only leather 
breeches and unadorned mocca- 
sins, muscles rippling across a 
powerful sun-tanned chest, his 
head thrown back in a posture of 
arrogant dignity. He wore a single 
crimson feather in his black top- 
knot, and at his belt was a toma- 
hawk only slightly less deadly 
looking than a howitzer. 

Arms folded across his chest, 
he swept his stunned audience 
with an eye like an eagle's, then 
began to speak. His voice, deep 
and ringing, carried beyond the 
edges of the crowd, so that Enoch 
was able to catch a portion of 
what he was saying. 

Wetzel admitted he understood 
very little of any of the Indian 
tongues. He thought the one he 
was hearing had its roots in the 
Delaware tribe, but admitted this 
was no more than a guess. How- 
ever, it appeared that the visitor 
was summoning the chiefs of the 
assembled tribes to a meeting 
within the spaceship. 

Evidently it took some doing. 
Faced with a familiar danger, 

100 



there is no human more coura- 
geous than an Indian. But the 
thought of entering the yawning 
maw of that steel cavern would 
have shaken the nerves of Mana- 
bus himself. 

Finally the visiting Indian's 
oratory paid off, and nine or ten 
of the tribal leaders reluctantly 
entered the spaceship. Two robots 
took up positions on the ramp to 
discourage kibitzers, and after 
an hour or so in which nothing 
more happened, the rest of the 
camp returned pretty much to 
normal. 

Mid-afternoon came and passed, 
and still the meeting inside the 
ship went on. Enoch was finding 
the tree branch not the most 
comfortable place to spend a 
weekend, and he was growing 
steadily more uneasy by his fa- 
ther's continued absence. 

More hours passed. The sun 
was gone now and campfires be- 
gan to dot the night. Orders or no 
orders, Enoch decided, he was 
going to find his Pop. With a 
stealth equal to that of any In- 
dian, he dropped to the ground 
and began a cautious advance in 
the direction his father had taken 
hours before. 

Suddenly the bushes crashed 
apart directly in front of him, and 
his father came bounding through. 
Only a few yards back, its giant 
strides rapidly closing the gap, 
came one of the huge steel men. 
Enoch's gun flashed up and he 

 



fired without aiming. The bullet 
struck one of the robot's huge 
eyes, shattering the glass and 
sending the towering figure crash- 
ing headlong into a tree. At the 
same instant, an ear-shattering 
wail came from the fallen robot, 
and powerful rays of light flashed 
from the rim of the spaceship to 
bathe the spot where the two 
Wetzels stood. 

Mixed with the siren wail from 
the fallen man of steel came a 
chorus of blood-curdling warhoops 
as the Indians made out the fig- 
ures of the two men, and a hun- 
dred braves came pouring across 
the clearing toward them. In- 
stantly the two scouts took to 
their heels, darting through the 
inky blackness of the forest with 
the sure-footed celerity of long 
practice. 

They would have escaped easily 
under ordinary circumstances. But 
suddenly the blast of another 
siren sounded directly ahead and 
a lance of light impaled them. 
Blinded, they stumbled aside, 
only to be caught by still another 
beam. 

The two men split apart and 
dived for cover. Enoch, finding 
himself shielded from the rays by 
the thick bole of a tree, scrambled 
into its branches. A moment later 
the first wave of Indians passed 
below him. 

For fully ten minutes he crouched 
there among the leaves. The bar- 
rage of light, he discovered, had 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



come from the towering robots, 
and he recalled the dozen or so 
steel monsters that had left the 
camp soon after the spaceship 
landed. Evidently they had been 
sent out to encircle the camp so 
that no one might leave or enter 
until the visitors permitted it. 

Finally Enoch heard the Indi- 
ans returning toward camp. He 
knew they would search every 
tree hunting for him. Reloading 
his rifle, he dropped to the ground 
and adopting the only maneuver 
they would- not expect, made his 
way cautiously back toward the 
camp. 

He had hoped to skirt the camp 
itself and find an avenue to free- 
dom in the opposite direction. 
But his hopes were almost im- 
mediately dashed, for he soon 
made out the darting rays of 
light marking more of the robots. 

Enoch was trapped. Taking ad- 
vantage of every possible means 
of cover, he inched ahead, chang- 
ing his direction a dozen times, 
until he suddenly stopped short, 
his path barred by the towering 
spaceship itself. Staying within 
the dense shadows at its base, 
he began to skirt the ship, hoping 
to find a place where he could 
hide out until the enemy gave up 
the search. 

But again his luck failed to hold. 
This time he was stopped by a 
wall of metal fully ten feet high, 
which turned out to be one side 

101 



of the entrance ramp to the space- 
ship. Circling it would bring him 
right into the camp, to climb over 
it was impossible; to turn back, 
useless. This was the end of the 
line! 

As he stood there trying to 
figure out his next move, he 
caught the sound of a guarded 
movement some distance behind 
him. Instantly he dropped to the 
grass, his long rifle ready to take 
at least one of his enemies with 
him. And that was when he learned 
that the bottom of the ramp was 
nearly two feet above the ground. 

Even Macy's shopping service 
couldn't have furnished him with 
a better hiding place. Enoch wrig- 
gled himself under the edge and 
lay there breathing quietly, while, 
a moment later, three pairs of 
moccasined feet moved over the 
spot where he had been hiding. 

Some time passed. He could 
hear voices very near and the 
rustle of feet moving through the 
grass. Then came the dull thud of 
metal against metal over his head 
in a rhythmic tempo like the 
tread of marching soldiers. Hardly 
had this ceased before he heard 
another sound which he could not 
identify, and the ramp itself began 
to move! 

It was drawing in toward the 
ship, very slowly. To stay where 
he was would mean the loss of his 
hiding place; to try to run away 
would almost certainly be fatal. 



And so Enoch acted in the only 
way left to him. 

By hooking his arms and legs 
around the girders forming the 
underside of the ramp, he was 
able to lift himself clear of the 
ground. It meant being carried 
into the ship, but even that, he 
decided, -was better than falling 
into the hands of Indians. 

He clung there like a sloth to a 
branch. Fortunately the beams 
were recessed enough to prevent 
his being scraped off when he 
reached the opening into the hull. 
When the ramp finally ground to a 
halt he found himself in darkness 
beyond anything in his experi- 
ence. There was cold metal under 
him now and he lowered himself 
gingerly onto it. When he tried 
to crawl into the open, he discov- 
ered that the edges of the ramp 
were now flush with the floor. 

Suddenly a deep humming note 
tore at his ears, became a shrill 
whine, then passed into silence. 
The floor seemed to press harder 
and harder into his back, his 
lungs fought for air, a sharp burst 
of light seemed to explode sound- 
lessly before his bulging eyes and 
consciousness left him. . . . 

The rasp of metal against metal 
aroused him. The ramp was mov- 
ing again. Once more he attached 
himself to its girders and was 
slowly carried from the spaceship. 
Sunlight on the grass told him the 
night had passed, and the mo- 
ment the ramp came to a halt, he 



102 



 



dropped to the ground and squirmed 
into the open. He was close 
enough to the ship to keep from 
being seen by those aboard, and 
he slipped quickly around one 
side before making a break for the 
shelter of a clump of trees border- 
ing the clearing. 

"And that, Mr. Quinlan," Kra- 
mer said, "just about brings you 
up to date. At 4:07 this afternoon 
Mr. Wetzel was found by the 
crew of an Army tank twelve 
miles west of Burdette, Colorado. 
He told his story to the colonel in 
charge of that perimeter of opera- 
tions, and was then flown directly 
to Washington." He paused and 
allowed himself a humorless smile. 
"I assume you have some ques- 
tions?" 

I said, "I'm not going to ask if 
you take this man's story seri- 
ously. Considering the positions 
of the men in this room you obvi- 
. ously do. What I'd like to know 
is why?" 

Kramer hesitated. "Let me ask 
you this, Quinlan," he said, choos- 
ing his words carefully. "Based 
solely on this man's costume and 
speech, would you say he is an 
impostor? " 

"No," I told him promptly. 
"Frontiersmen dressed exactly 
that way, the long gun is authen- 
tic and his pronunciation, phrases 
and idiom comes straight out of 
pre-Revolutionary times. But I 
still fail to see why you give a 

CALt, HIM SAV/ GE 



second thought to his story." 
"You don't think it true?" 
"My God, man, how can it be? 
Unless you're trying to tell me 
that this character was brought 
here by a time machine!" 

"One moment, Mr. Quinlan." 
Secretary of War McClave was 
back in the picture. "Let me tell 
you why we do not regard Mr. 
Wetzel as a mental case. Shortly 
after one o'clock this afternoon, 
Rocky Mountain Time, a section 
of Washington County, Colorado, 
roughly thirty miles in circum- 
ference was suddenly cut off from 
the rest of the country — cut off 
as completely as though it never 
existed. Telephone lines ceased to 
function, a radio station in the 
same area went off the air in the 
middle of a soap commercial. All 
traffic, vehicular and foot, ceased 
to come out of it. The Governor 
of Colorado sent in a detachment 
of the National Guard; nothing 
has been heard from it since. Air 
observers report all cars and trains 
appear to have stalled. Two planes 
trying a bit of hedge-hopping ap- 
parently conked out and were 
forced to land. No radio contact 
with them." 

I said, "I heard some of this on 
a news broadcast shortly before 
midnight tonight. According to 
the announcer the area involved 
was larger than thirty miles." 

McClave nodded soberly. "The 
affected area is expanding stead- 
ily. It now reaches as far west as 

103 



Strasburg, Colorado, and as far 
east as the Nebraska state line. 
The north and south limits seem 
to be somewhat narrower." 

I looked at him and at the other 
men around the table. Their faces 
held a quiet tautness, and General 
Ohlmsted's hand, holding a cigar, 
was shaking a little. "And," I 
said, "you feel that this space- 
ship holds the answer. Is that it? " 

"It's all we have to go on," 
the President said softly. 

"One more question," I said. 
"Where do I fit into this?" 

There was a moment's awkward 
silence, broken by the creak of 
the chair holding the man who 
had been introduced to me as a 
Mr. Proudfit. His round face 
smiled at me almost jovially. 

"I expect I'm the one to explain 
that, Mr. Quinlan. Wetzel tells 
us the man in charge of the space- 
ship appeared to be an Indian. It 
seems our best move is to send 
an emissary into the blacked-out 
section to learn the reason for this 
• — well — this attack. Such a rep- 
resentative should be qualified to 
deal intelligently with this — this 
Indian. Somebody able to under- 
stand the Indian temperament. 
In short, Mr. Quinlan, you!" 

I rubbed a hand along the back 
of my neck and smiled. "You 
know, this whole thing is utterly 
mad! Indians, time machines, ro- 
bots, spaceships! But then these 
days the most fertile imaginations 



can't seem to keep up with reality. 
If you gentlemen want me to try 
to get to this Indian and ask him 
what's the big idea, I'll do my 
best. Not because I want to, but 
because I wouldn't know how to 
go about -refusing the President 
of my country." 

Some of the tension seemed to 
go out of the room. The President 
said, "You won't find me or your 
country ungrateful, Mr. Quin- 
lan," and the Secretary of War 
nodded approvingly, and General 
Ohlmsted's cigar stopped shaking. 
Proudfit took out a sheaf of pa- 
pers from an inner pocket of his 
coat, leafed through them quickly 
and handed one to me. "This au- 
thorizes you as a representative of 
the United States Government, 
answerable only to the President, 
and with full authority to act 
accordingly." 

"Fine," I said, putting it away. 
"Maybe I can use it on these ro- 
bots Wetzel mentioned!" 

Proudfit looked at his strap- 
watch. "An Army jet bomber will 
take you and Mr. Wetzel to a 
point as close to Burdette, Colo- 
rado, as can be managed. Wetzel 
tells us he can locate the spaceship 
from that point. We don't know, 
of course, how closely guarded 
the ship is — or even if it's 
guarded at all. But Wetzel is con- 
fident his training and back- 
ground as a frontiersman and In- 
dian fighter can get you there un- 
der cover of darkness. Once you 



104 



 



reach the spaceship, the rest is 
up to you." 

"And if I don't make it?" 

Proudfit spread his hands. "Two 
companies of Army regulars en- 
tered that area at 6:30 tonight. 
They were fully armed, with or- 
ders to use those arms if neces- 
sary. Nothing has been heard 
from them since. We're sending 
you on the theory that where 
many can't get through perhaps 
one or two can. You have until 
noon — slightly more than eleven 
hours from now — to get word to 
us. If we don't hear from you by 
then or if the 'dead' area con- 
tinues to expand after that time, 
then we throw our Sunday punch!" 

Enoch Wetzel was still stand- 
ing exactly as he had while telling 
his story. I walked over to him. 
"Let's get one thing straight, mis- 
ter. If you and I are going to work 
together, we leave personal feel- 
ings out of it. A few minutes ago 
I passed a remark" or two about 
one of your relatives and you 
tried to knock my head off. I'm 
willing to forget it if you are. But 
I don't want any more cracks out 
of you about my being a half- 
breed. Is that clear?" 

He eyed me stonily, then with- 
out change of expression spat on 
the rug within a quarter-inch of 
my left shoe. I felt the muscles 
in my arms twang like plucked 
wires as I resisted the impulse to 
swing on him. "Is that your an- 
swer, Wetzel?" 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



"I'll git you thar," he said 
tonelessly. ' ' I promised these yere 
gennelmen I'd do thet much. But it 
don't hold I gotta cotton to you." 

We stood there staring into 
each other's eyes. There was a 
wall of hatred between us that 
could never be destroyed, a wall 
not fashioned by us but by our 
forefathers generations before. Yet 
a chain of incredible events had 
made us allies against an alien 
foe. In spite of our mutual dislike 
we must work together. 

I turned back to Proudfit. "I'll 
need a pair of heavy black basket- 
ball shoes, dark coveralls, a good 
heavy sweater, a .38 Colt auto- 
matic with plenty of ammunition, 
and a compass." 

The bomber pilot was a fresh- 
faced youngster who chewed gum 
and claimed to have been the 
second -ranking tennis player in 
Des Moines, Iowa. He shook 
hands gravely with me, eyed Wet- 
zel and his strange garb and out- 
size rifle with blank-faced wonder, 
and mentioned that it was a nice 
night for flving. 

The plane took off at 1:27. We 
were due over our target by 4:00 
o'clock Eastern Standard Time, 
or 2 :00 Mountain Time. The plans 
called for the bomber to fly at a 
high altitude, then come in on 
Burdette with jets off and drop us 
by 'chute. Wetzel had balked for 
a while at the idea of stepping 

105 



off into space, but a brief but pa- 
tient explanation of how a para- 
chute worked finally brought him 
grudgingly around. 

The trip seemed to take for- 
ever. I was torn by a thousand 
doubts, saddened by not being al- 
lowed to say goodbye to Lois, not 
a little afraid of what I would 
likely run into in Colorado. And 
all the while, my companion, out 
of his normal world and time, sur- 
rounded by wonders beyond his 
wildest nightmares, slept sound as 
an infant. . . . 

A hand shook me awake. In the 
faint glow of a flashlight I made 
out the face of the co-pilot. 
"Twenty minutes, Mr. Quinlan." 

Wetzel was already on his feet. 
The co-pilot helped us don the 
'chutes, and five minutes before 
arrival opened the heavy side 
door. A rush of wind tore in, but 
there was no other sound. The 
jets had already cut off and the 
plane was gradually losing alti- 
tude in a shallow dive. As this was 
not a plane used for parachute 
troops there was no wire to hook 
the 'chute cord to. It meant we 
would have to pull our own, but 
both of us had been thoroughly 
versed in what to do. 

"Get ready," shouted the co- 
pilot. 

I grasped the door frame and 
waited, my heart pounding in my 
ears. Wetzel stood directly behind 
me, the muzzle-loader in his hand, 
the tail of his coonskin cap bounc- 



ing in the wind, his eyes narrowed. 

"Five," the co-pilot said sud- 
denly. "And a four, and a three, 
and a two, and a one — target!" 

I dived headfirst into blackness. 
I spun madly earthward, but in 
the back'of my mind a calm voice 
counted off the seconds. Then I 
yanked at the ring-cord, black 
folds of nylon rustled above me, 
I heard a sharp report like the 
crack of a giant whip, the straps 
at my shoulders yanked painfully, 
and I was floating gently down 
toward the night-shrouded sur- 
face of Colorado. 

I landed in a meadow, if that 
was what they called it this far 
west. I came down hard but in the 
way they had told me would pre- 
vent injury. There was no wind to 
yank me about before I could un- 
ship the parachute, and within 
seconds I was on my feet and 
searching for some sign of Enoch 
Wetzel. 

Unexpectedly a hand struck me 
lightly on the back. I was jumping 
aside and reaching for my gun 
when the frontiersman's quiet 
voice reached me. "You scare 
mighty easy for an Injun." 

I said, "We should be about a 
mile, two at the most, south of the 
road where that Army tank picked 
you up yesterday afternoon. Let's 
find it." 

"Aye." 

The land was by no means as 
flat as I had expected. Fortunately 



106 



 



most of it was relatively open, 
with only scattered clumps of 
trees and bushes. There were too 
many small unexplained night 
sounds, but none of these appeared 
to alarm Wetzel in the slightest, 
so I managed to ignore them. 
Once we flushed a long-eared rab- 
bit, and it was five minutes before 
I could get my heart out of my 
throat. 

A barbed -wire fence, the first 
we had encountered, told me we 
had reached a road. It wasn't 
paved or even graveled — just a 
ribbon of dirt pointing east and 
west as straight as an Apache 
lance. Nothing moved along it in 
either direction as far as 1 could 
see. A line of telephone poles 
bordered one side. 

"Recognize any landmarks?" 
I asked. 

Wetzel shook his head. 

"We're probably east of where 
you were found," I said. "We 
might as well start walking." 

He grunted in agreement and 
we started out. It was a lovely 
starlit night, no moon at this hour, 
and a lot warmer than I had ex- 
pected for October in Colorado. 
Now and then the road dipped 
and climbed, and as we reached 
the crest of the third hill, I saw 
a good -sized farmhouse set well 
back from the road among a group 
of out-buildings. 

I pointed to the house. "Maybe 
they can tell us what's been hap- 
pening around here." 



Wetzel nodded and we turned 
in at a fieldstone path leading 
across the large yard to the front 
door. There were no lights visible 
from within, no dog barked, no 
rustle of livestock in the barns or 
pens. 

I saw him just before I stepped 
on his head. He was lying across 
the path in the shadow cast by a 
gnarled tree, a stocky man in 
overalls arid a blue work shirt. A 
double-barrelled twelve-gauge shot- 
gun lay on the ground near his 
right hand. One side of his chest 
was black with a sticky substance 
that could have been only one 
thing, and the top of his head was 
black in the same way, except that 
no hair was there anymore. . . . 

"Scalped!" I whispered hoarsely. 

Enoch Wetzel stooped sud- 
denly and picked up the shotgun 
and wordlessly held it out to me. 
My jaw fell in astonishment. The 
twin barrels were bent into a rude 
V. 

I licked my lips and backed 
away. "Let's get out of here, 
Wetzel." 

He tossed the gun aside and we 
turned back to the road. Neither 
of us said anything for fully a 
mile. "No human hands could 
have done that to a gun," I said. 
"I'm beginning to believe what 
you said about robots. Robots 
that take scalps!" 

Another hill, another valley 
» . . and Wetzel caught hold of 



CALL HIM SAVAGE 



107/ 



my arm. "I come across them so- 
jers about here," he said. 

"Okay. From now on you act 
as guide." 

We went on. Several times 
Wetzel's long, swinging, tireless 
stride left me behind and he was 
forced to wait until I caught up 
with him again. I had the feeling 
that I was holding him back, and 
there was something faintly con- 
temptuous in his obvious patience. 
But the life of a book-writing 
newspaper man hadn't prepared 
me for cross-country marathons, 
and there was nothing to be done 
about it now. 

The fairly level, open ground 
was giving place to a heavily 
wooded countryside. After an- 
other mile of winding roadway, 
Wetzel suddenly turned aside and 
plunged into the forest. It was as 
dark as the inside of an under- 
taker's hat, and after I had 
banged into a few dozen trees and 
tripped over a few dead branches, 
making enough racket to alert 
half the state, Wetzel slowed his 
pace to a crawl. 

Finally I grabbed one of the 
fringed sleeves of his buckskin 
shirt to stop him and sank down 
on a fallen log. "How much far- 
ther?" 

He leaned his folded arms on 
the muzzle of his long gun and I 
could feel his deep-set eyes study- 
ing me without approval. '"Nother 
hour; p'rhaps more. Dependin' 
on you." 

108 



"Sure," I said with understand- 
able bitterness. "I'm not the man 
my granddaddy was. Nobody is. 
When I take a walk it's down to 
the corner for a pack of cigarettes. 
Anything farther than that I use 
a horseless carriage. We don't 
need steel muscles and superior 
woodcraft these days, brother. 
Just enough eyesight to read the 
directions on the can, ears sharp 
enough to hear the boss bawling 
you out, enough nose to smell 
the whiskey on your neighboring 
straphanger's breath, reflexes quick 
enough to avoid being run down 
by some politician's Cadillac. If 
I 'd have known I was going to be 
called on to go batting around a 
jungle, I'd have been down to the 
Y five days a we — " 

He moved like a striking snake. 
A hand was clapped over my 
mouth and a knee forced me to 
the ground. Before I could make 
an effort to fight back, he placed 
his mouth close to my ear. "Dan- 
ger! Tis death for so much as a 
broken twig!" 

He removed his hand and I 
could breathe again. We lay there 
side by side close to a huge tree, 
deep in the shadows. And then 
faintly as from far off I heard the 
crackle of disturbed undergrowth 
and, slowly louder and louder, an 
evenly spaced thumping sound 
that seemed to shake the earth. 

Through the trees it came, di- 
rectly toward the spot where Wet- 
zel and I hugged the ground. It 

 



loomed against the night, a tower 
of steel on jointed legs, a horrible 
travesty of the human figure, a 
head like King Arthur's helmet. 
Starlight picked out two round 
faceted eyes of glass. 

My suddenly dry mouth puck- 
ered with the taste of terror. I did 
not breathe; even my heart seemed 
to beat no more. I wanted to close 
my eyes, but even the lids seemed 
paralyzed. 

_ For almost a full minute the 
giant robot remained standing less 
than ten feet from where Wetzel 
and I were lying. It seemed to 
sense the presence of something 
of flesh and blood nearby. Its 
head turned slowly from side to 
side in little uneven jerks that 
put ice cubes in my veins. Finally 
the mammoth feet began their 
rhythmic thumping and a moment 
later it disappeared among the 
trees. 

After what seemed a long time 
Wetzel rose to his feet. I got up 
slowly and leaned against the 
tree. "In a little while," I said 
softly, "I'll wake up. I'll be in 
bed with my wife, under the nice 
clean white sheets, and I'll know 
all this was a nightmare brought 
on by that canned salmon we had 
for dinner." 

This, I told myself sharply, 
wasn't getting me anywhere ex- 
cept next door to hysteria. I 
ground my teeth together, shud- 
dered uncontrollably for a second 



or two, then was all right again. 
Or nearly so. 

"Let's go," I said. 
An hour or so later, after taking 
a twisting route through what 
seemed to be the Belgian Congo, 
Wetzel halted under the spreading 
branches of a towering cotton- 
wood. With his lips close to my 
ear, he whispered, "It's a-settin' 
out thar midst open ground." He 
gestured at the wall of blackness 
hemming us in — blackness you 
could have cut into hunks with an 
ax. "I'm thinkin' thar's plenty 'o 
them iron critters roamin' 'round 
twixt us an' it. You aimin' to 
await the dawn?" 

"You," I said, "said it!" 

The dawn came up nice and 
quiet. Blackness turned gray and 
then a pearl pink — and there she 
was: a hundred yards from us, of 
some gleaming metal resembling 
aluminum, twenty feet high and 
covering about as much ground 
as a caretaker's cottage. It re- 
sembled nothing more than a soup 
plate turned bottom up to dry. 

A tall, semi-circular opening 
showed black in one side, with a 
sloping metallic ramp reaching 
from it to the ground. Two robots 
guarded the entrance, stiff and 
towering and without movement, 
the early light glistening along 
their jointed bodies. 

In sharp contrast to this scene 
from the distant future was the 
anachronistic spectacle of six In- 



CALL HIM SAVAGE 



109 



dians, in war paint, fringed buck- 
skin and stripped to the waist, 
squatting around a small cooking 
fire near the ship. Within easy 
reach of each was a long bow and 
a quiver of arrows. 

Nothing about them gave me 
a certain clue as to which Indian 
family they belonged to. The sin- 
gle feather in each scalp lock was 
pure white with a vivid red tip. 
Two of them wore the black paint 
of untried warriors, and all were 
gnawing on strips of meat' grilled 
over the fire. 

Wetzel, placid and silent, leaned 
on his rifle and calmly stuffed a 
cheek with a twist of black to- 
bacco. "Reckon they be a little 
hard to talk to?" he asked in a 
soft voice. 

I shrugged. "Only one way I 
know of to find out." 

"Thet fancy pistol you got 
could kill 'em all afore they get 
them bows unlimbered." 

"Are you suggesting I shoot 
them down without warning?" 

It was his turn to shrug. "They 
be Indians." 

The complete lack of feeling in 
his tone infuriated, me "You 
cold-blooded bastard! I happen 
to be a good part Indian myself." 

He eyed me without expression 
but with a chill glitter to his eyes. 
"Aye. I ain't forgettin' thet," he 
said, and spat. 

I took a slow breath and waited 
until I could trust my voice. "I'm 
going out there," I said quietly. 



"Cover me with your gun. But 
don't use it unless it's the only 
thing left to do. I don't want that 
trigger pulled until the last pos- 
sible second. They may grab me, 
they may even knock me around 
a little.- That I can take. But 
don't try to interfere until there's 
no other way out. Is that clear?" 
"Aye." 

I turned away from him. All I 
had to do now was step out from 
behind that tree and walk across 
the open ground. Each of my feet 
suddenly weighed a ton. Two 
steps into that clearing and the 
funeral could be Monday. In- 
stinctively my hand crawled to- 
ward the .38 automatic hidden in 
my coveralls. It never got that 
far. Suicide was so final. 

Wetzel's firm young mouth 
held an almost invisible sneer. 
Deliberately I took out a ciga- 
rette, lighted it with an airy 
gesture and a match, dragged 
deeply on it twice and threw it 
away. I said, "Lay off that gun 
like I told you," and walked 
slowly out into the clearing. 

It got a rise out of them, all 
right. They were on their feet, 
arrows notched, before I had 
traveled three feet. I never even 
hesitated. Once I had gone this 
far, the bluff had to be carried all 
the way out. I kept my spine stiff, 
my head erect, my hands con- 
spicuously empty at my sides. If 
my nerves were jumping I was 



110 



 



the only one who knew about it. 

It caught them just a shade off- 
balance, which was all I had 
hoped for. The one-sidedness of 
six drawn bows against one un- 
impressive and unarmed man 
eventually registered and the 
flint tips wavered, then turned 
aside. 

The tallest of the braves — a 
lean number the color of an old 
penny — ■ tossed his bow aside and 
deliberately stepped squarely in 
my path. There was an insolent 
arrogance in every line of his 
body — a body that topped my 
six feet a full three inches. 

I said, "Hi-yo, Silver," and put 
my hip into his naked belly and 
grabbed his arm and threw him 
over my shoulder. He hit face 
first two yards away and plowed 
up a furrow of grass, flopped 
around a little, then lay still. 

Nobody else moved, except me. 
I started for the spaceship again, 
not hurrying and not crawling, 
head still up, spine still stiff, eyes 
straight ahead. Feet slithered in 
the grass behind me and the sound 
made the skin between my shoul- 
der blades twitch like an aching 
tooth. Every instinct that had 
anything to do with self-preserva- 
tion was fighting to make me turn 
around. 

That was when the robots 
moved. They seemed to come 
alive at the same instant, metal 
clanged on metal as they strode 
stiffly down the ramp to meet 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



me. Violence hung over them as it 
hangs over a Patton tank. 

Every step toward them was 
like pulling my foot out of quick- 
sand. Only twelve kinds of a 
cretin would have gone on when 
faced with anything like this. I 
went on. I couldn't do anything 
else. Once you show an Indian a 
molecule of cowardice, you're 
twelve lines on the obituary page. 

The space between us was down 
to a narrow ribbon of grass by 
this time. Four — three more 
steps and I would have to stop. 
Nobody could push aside a couple 
of tons of animated steel. Metal 
arms were lifting slowly, prepar- 
ing to close on me. Inside me a 
silent voice screamed a prayer 
for Wetzel to pull that trigger 
and pump a bullet into one of 
those round, staring, faceted 
eyes. . . . 

The robots seemed to go dead. 
They hung there motionless, arms 
lifted, each with a massive foot 
caught in midstride. 

What had stopped them at the 
last possible second I had no way 
of telling. All I did know was a 
sudden release of tension that 
left me with just enough strength 
to keep my feet moving. 

I went on. 

The edge of the ramp was get- 
ting uncomfortably close. I was 
here to see the head man, but I 
would prefer to see him out in the 
open. The thought of walking 

111 



into that black hole left me as 
cold as a barefoot Eskimo. 

The ramp. It was a good six 
feet wide, made of what seemed 
to be some form of an aluminum 
alloy, and was waiting to be 
walked on. I started up its shallow 
slope, the rubber soles of my 
basketball shoes soundless on the 
smooth surface. 

He appeared suddenly, without 
warning, in the doorway. He was 
quite tall, si im in the hips, and 
his naked shoulders seemed al- 
most as wide as the opening. 
Elaborate beadwork designs had 
been worked into the buckskin 
breeches, and his headdress re- 
sembled a Sioux warbonnet, its 
twin rows of red-tipped feathers 
hanging almost to his moccasins. 
A hunting knife hung in a snake- 
skin sheath at his right hip. He 
was as gauntly handsome as a 
Blackfoot — and they don't come 
any better-looking than that. 

He stood there, arms folded 
across his chest, looking as im- 
movable as Pike's Peak. This time 
I stopped. My back was as stiff 
as his, my head as erect, my 
shoulders as square if not as 
wide. For a long time we stood 
that way staring straight into 
each other's eyes, our expressions 
blank, our tongues locked. 

When enough time had passed 
for me to open the conversation 
without being accused of impetu- 
ousness, I said, "I am Long 
Rock, of the Potawatomi. I have 



come in peace, to hold counsel 
with you." 

My words, in the language of 
the Delaware because of Wetzel's 
earlier remark, had no immediate 
effect, which was par for the 
course with any Indian. Not even 
his eyelids moved. The silence 
went on, building into tension. 
Anyone unfamiliar with the ways 
of the Indian would have taken 
another stab at it. I knew better. 
I had made my pitch; now it was 
strictly up to him. 

Finally his strong lips came un- 
stuck. "I am Lo-as-ro, War Chief 
of the Kornesh." It was the 
Delaware tongue, all right, but 
with inflexions and nuances 
strange to me. "How is it that 
your skin is white but you speak 
in the way of the Orbiwah?" 

That last word, I judged, was 
what the Indian in general was 
called wherever this speciman 
had come from. I said, "In my 
blood is the blood of the Orbiwah. 
That is why I am here, sent by 
the Great Chief of all white 
men." 

We squatted down facing each 
other on the ramp. At once a 
young brave brought out a long, 
elaborately carved peace-pipe. 
Lo-as-ro put the bit to his mouth 
and puffed smoke toward the four 
cardinal points of the compass, 
then passed the pipe to me. The 
tobacco was far more aromatic 
than any I had come across be- 
fore.

With the amenities out of the 
way, the Chief said, "Why has 
the White Chief sent you to me?" 

"To welcome you to the land of 
the white man." 

"1 come not to the land of the 
white man in peace." 

My eyes were as cold as his 
own. "This we do not under- 
stand. The white man has no 
quarrel with the tribe of Kor- 
nesh." 

"The white man," Lo-as-ro 
said sonorously, "has taken from 
the Orbiwah his land and his 
home. He has driven the Orbiwah 
into small areas. He has killed 
buffalo and the bison and the 
deer, leaving the Orbiwah to eat 
the meat of the horse or to starve. 
The Orbiwah has been made foul 
with the diseases of the white 
man." 

"All this," I said, "was long, 
long ago. Perhaps it was not 
right, but it is the way of life that 
the strong prevail and the weak 
perish." 

His expression darkened. "You 
say this — you with the blood of 
the Orbiwah in your veins?" 

"I speak only true words, noble 
Lo -as-ro. The white men are in 
number as the leaves of the 
forest, the Orbiwah few and help- 
less." 

One of his hands made a grace- 
ful motion. "I have come to re- 
turn the land to the Orbiwah, to 
restore him to. the greatness of his 
fathers. Once more the land shall 



be alive with game, the rivers 
filled with fish. Once more shall 
the Orbiwah hunt with the weap- 
ons of his fathers. I have spoken." 

"From whence do you come?" 
I asked. 

He pointed dramatically to- 
ward the sky. "From a great 
distance. Up there are many 
worlds." 

"Tell me of your world," I said. 

The telling took a long time but 
not a word of it was dull. Accord- 
ing to Lo-as-ro, his world was a 
planet revolving about one of the 
stars in the Big Dipper. It was 
slightly smaller than Earth, with 
about the same climates and de- 
velopment of life. It was peopled 
with only one race, the Orbiwah, 
who lived much as the Indians in 
America did before the arrival of 
the white man. Recently space- 
ships from another planet in the 
same solar system had landed on 
the Orbiwah world. These new- 
comers were friendly, had no 
thought of conquest, and pos- 
sessed a science and culture of 
amazing proportions. 

From them the Orbiwah learned 
of a planet on which were men of 
their own kind. Lo-as-ro, fired by 
the thought of establishing con- 
tact with people like himself, had 
borrowed spaceships manned by 
robots and crossed the void to 
Earth. For weeks they had hov- 
ered in our atmosphere, at first 
saddened, then angered, by the 



CALL HIM SAVAGE 



113 



fate meted out to the Indians. 

Since the spaceships were able 
to move through Time into the 
past, Lo-as-ro hit on the idea of 
going back to the days when the 
Indian was still in control of most 
of America. With the power at 
his control he could force the 
white man from the continent 
and restore the land to those who 
owned it. 

Arriving near the close of the 
Eighteenth Century, he found a 
sizeable encampment of Indians, 
brought the ship down among 
them, and summoned the chiefs 
to a Council of War, where he 
outlined to them his plan. To 
his astonishment he found the 
chiefs suspicious of outside help 
and confident that they could 
defeat the white man alone. In 
vain did Lo-as-ro explain that 
they were doomed; they could 
not, or would not, believe that he 
had visited the future. He offered 
to take them ahead and let them 
see for themselves — an offer that 
was quickly refused. 

Whereupon Lo-as-ro decided to 
return to the Present and wrest 
the land from the white man and 
hand it over to the downtrodden 
remnants of a once-powerful race. 
It was on that return trip that 
Wetzel had arrived in the present 
century. 

When Lo-as-ro finished, I leaned 
back against the side of the ship 
and lit a cigarette, bringing a 
startled grunt from the chief. I 

114 



said, "You cannot defeat the 
white man, Lo-as-ro. He has 
weapons such as you have never 
dreamed : machines that can throw 
things that explode and kill hun- 
dreds of braves at one time, 
machines that travel through the 
air as does the one you came in, 
things that can wipe out all life 
within a circle as wide as a brave 
can ride around in one day on a 
fast horse. 

"No, noble Lo-as-ro. Return to 
your world and leave this one to 
the white man. He took it long 
ago and he will never give it up. 
I have spoken." 

The chief of the Orbiwah smiled 
grimly. "In the ship in which I 
arrived on your world is a small 
machine. It is working for me 
now. Within its reach no weapon 
is useful, no explosion can take 
place, no signal can be sent. Only 
Man is not touched by this 
machine, but when it works he 
has no weapons with which to 
fight. Each hour the influence of 
this machine widens. Soon all 
this land will be helpless. Then 
the robots will take charge and 
those who oppose them will be 
slain." 

I thought of the "dead spot" 
I had first heard about on the 
newscast the night before, and 
how it was steadily growing. I 
remembered the slain farmer with 
the missing scalp, the two com- 
panies of soldiers helpless without 
radio, guns and transportation. 

 



I thought of a mechanized Amer- 
ica helpless before a few score of 
these spaceships . . . and I knew 
that counter-violence would be 
useless. 

"Give the country back to the 
Indians!" The cry of the over- 
burdened citizen. It seemed it was 
about to come to that ! 

For a long time I sat there, 
thinking, trying to hit on an 
answer that would save my coun- 
try. And when the answer finally 
stirred at the back of my mind, it 
was so completely bizarre that I 
almost missed it entirely. . . . 

"Noble Lo-as-ro," I said, "I 
must return to the Great White 
Father and tell him what I have 
learned. I will tell him that there 
is nothing to be done to oppose the 
Chief of the Kornesh. Within a few 
hours I will return with his reply." 

Lo-as-ro inclined his fine head 
in assent. "Let it be so." 

"Until my return," I said, "let 
the influence of the machine draw 
back until it holds helpless only 
a small section of land about your 
ship. Only in this way will I be 
able to return quickly to the 
White Chief." 

Again Lo-as-ro agreed. I took 
my leave of him ceremoniously, 
and a few minutes later Wetzel 
and I were hurrying back toward 
the highway. 

Four hours later I was on my 
way back, this time with four 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



companions. The plane landed us 
at the edge of the newly set 
"dead spot" and the five of us 
forced our way through the for- 
est until we reached the clear- 
ing where the spaceship still 
crouched. 

A silent group of Indians 
watched us as we crossed the open 
ground. This time the two robots 
flanking the doorway did not 
leave their posts. As I came up 
the ramp with my companions, 
Lo-as-ro appeared in the doorway 
of the ship. 

He eyed me and the others 
without expression. I said, "Noble 
Lo-as-ro, I have brought with me 
four of my world's Orbiwah. They 
have come to hear your plan for 
them and their people. I have told 
them nothing of what you said to 
me, only that you have come 
from another world and are of 
their blood." 

One by one I presented my 
companions. Yellow Arm was 
Johnny Armin, an old school 
friend Of mine; Iron Eagle, with 
whom I had spent a year in 
Korea, had his telephone listed 
under the name of Luke Riegel; 
Strong Wind was Sidney Storm, 
whom I had met while spending 
a year in Southern California; and 
Lone Pine, known as Lionel Pat- 
terson, lived a few doors down the 
street from me in Washington 
and shot eighteen holes any day 
in the low seventies. 

The color of their skins, the 

115 



unmistakable cast of their fea- 
tures, made up the only passport 
they needed. At the chief's invi- 
tation we squatted in a rude 
circle at the top of the ramp, and 
the peace-pipe was brought out 
and passed around. 

Presently Lo-as-ro began to 
speak. The magnificent voice 
rolled out in tones like a cathedral 
organ, explaining how the Ameri- 
can Indian was to assume his 
rightful place in a world of his 
own. It was a vivid picture, 
painted by an orator equal to any 
of the almost legendary Indian 
speakers, and they don't come 
any better. 

Unfortunately I was the only 
one present who could understand 
him. 

When it was over and Lo-as-ro 
was smiling in confident expec- 
tation of their gratified excite- 
ment, Johnny Armin gave me a 
baffled glance. "What the hell 
was that all about, Sam?" 

I said, "You guys don't know 
how lucky you are. The chief, here, 
is going to fix it up for you to go 
back to the good old days. Be 
noble red men. No more taxes, 
no more taxis. Live out in the 
fresh air, sleep under the star- 
studded sky, drink the unchlori- 
nated spring water." 

" What!" 

' ' You heard me. And he can do 
it, too. He's got the tools to 
flatten the country." 



They stared at me and at each 
other, horror and anger hardening 
their faces. Lo-as-ro had stopped 
smiling and was glancing about 
the circle in obvious bewilder- 
ment. 

"You mean he's doing all that 
for us?" Storm demanded. 

"For all Indians," I said. "Free 
them from the iron heel of the 
oppressor, and all that." 

"Nuts, brother!" Iron Eagle 
snapped. "Tell him I'm a gradu- 
ate of Carnegie Tech, make 
twenty-five grand a year with 
Standard Oil, and vote the Re- 
publican ticket. If he thinks for 
a goddam minute I'm going to 
chasing around on a pinto pony 
hunting buffalo, he's got rocks in 
his head!" 

"And that goes for me — dou- 
ble!" Lone Pine growled. "I 
never heard anything so screwy!" 

I repeated what they had said, 
putting it into words Lo-as-ro 
could understand. He had the 
look of a man who couldn't believe 
his ears. "They speak with stupid 
tongues," he cried. "Do they 
deny the blood of their fathers?" 

"They live as they want to 
live, noble chief," I said. "They 
are grateful for your wish to help 
but they ask me to decline the 
offer." 

He came to his feet with a 
bound, his lean face hardening 
into a copper mask of anger. 
"These are not true Orbiwah!" 
he thundered. "These are as 



116 



 



women, soft with idleness and 
pleasure, weakened by their white 
conquerors. The land is not for 
them ; it is for those forced to live 
in degradation and squalor, dying 
of hunger and disease, ignored by 
the white chiefs. It is they who 
shall be given back the ways of 
their fathers, that they may 
become a great Orbiwah nation 
once more. I have spoken!" 

"Look at these braves," I said. 
All of us were standing now. "Of 
all the Orbiwah in this world it is 
such as these who could hope to 
survive under the conditions you 
wish to establish. The Orbiwah 
you describe would starve amid a 
thousand buffalo, they would fall 
from their horses, they would flee 
in battle. Take away the protec- 
tion of the white chiefs and they 
would die." 

The chief of the tribe of Kor- 
nesh curled his lips in a sneer. 
"The protection given by the 
white chiefs is the protection of 
death. They do not care what 
happens to the Orbiwah. I have 
seen it with my own eyes." 

"You're right," I said promptly. 
"The Orbiwah has been badly 
treated too long. I shall return to 
the Great White Chief and tell 
him this: unless the life of the 
Orbiwah is made good, unless he 
has fine shelter, plenty of food, 
warm clothes for his back and the 
right to be as other men, you will 
return and force the white man 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



from this land. It will take much 
time, but it shall come to pass. / 
have spoken." 

Doubt flickered in his eyes. 
"Perhaps your words are empty. 
How do I know they are true?" 

"When twenty summers have 
passed," I said, "come back 
again. Look upon the Orbiwah 
and learn if they still suffer want 
and privation. If their life is not 
better for what has happened 
today, then you need never trust 
the white man again." 

For a long moment he stood 
stiff as steel, staring into my eyes. 
Then his hand shot up, palm out, 
in a gesture of farewell, and he 
turned and disappeared into the 
spaceship. 

I got a barrage of questions 
then. I held up a hand to quiet 
my friends. "Some other time, 
gentlemen. I've got to get to 
Washington just as fast as a jet 
plane can get me there." 

"If it's that urgent," Luke 
said, "call him on the phone and 
reverse the charges." 

I scowled at him. "Call who?" 

"The President. Isn't he the 
reason you're in such a hurry?" 

"No! I've got to get to bed." 

"Bed? If you're that tired—" 

"Who said anything about be- 
ing tired?" I demanded. "Being 
tired has nothing to do with it." 

"Then what — " 

"It seems," I said, "there's a 
black dace nightgown . . ."
