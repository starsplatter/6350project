DEATH 

OF A 

SPACEMAN 

BY WALTER M. MILLER, JR. 

The manner in which a man has lived is often the 
key to the way he will die. Take old man Donegal, 
for example. Most of his adult life was spent in 
digging a hole through space to learn what was on 
the other side. Would he go out the same way? 



Old Donegal was dying. They 
had all known it was coming, 
and they watched it come — his 
haggard wife, his daughter, and 
now his grandson, home on emer- 
gency leave from the pre-astro- 
nautics academy. Old Donegal 
knew it too, and had known it 
from the beginning, when he had 
begun to lose control of his legs 
and was forced to walk with a 
cane. But most of the time, he 
pretended to let them keep the 
secret they shared with the doc- 
tors — that the operations had all 
been failures, and that the cancer 
that fed at his spine would gnaw 
its way brainward until the pa- 
ralysis engulfed vital organs, and 
then Old Donegal would cease to 
be. It would be cruel to let them 
know that he knew. Once, weeks 
ago, he had joked about the ap- 
proaching shadows. 



"Buy the plot back where peo- 
ple won't walk over it, Martha," 
he said. "Get it way back under 
the cedars — next to the fence. 
There aren't many graves back 
there yet. I want to be alone." 

"Don't talk that way, Donny!" 
his wife had choked. "You're not 
dying." 

His eyes twinkled maliciously. 
"Listen, Martha, I want to be 
buried face-down. I want to be 
buried with my back to space, 
understand? Don't let them lay 
me out like a lily." 

"Donny, please!" 

"They oughta face a man the 
way he's headed," Donegal 
grunted. "I been up — way up. 
Now I'm going straight down." 

Martha had fled from the room 
in tears. He had never done it 
again, except to the interns and 
nurses, who, while they insisted 



7 



that he was going to get well, 
didn't mind joking with him about 
it. 

Martha can bear my death, he 
thought, can bear pre-knowledge 
of it. But she couldn't bear think- 
ing that he might take it calmly. 
If he accepted death gracefully, it 
would be like deliberately leaving 
her, and Old Donegal had decided 
to help her believe whatever 
would be comforting to her in such 
a troublesome moment. 

"When '11 they let me out of 
this bed again?" he complained. 

"Be patient, Donny, "she 
sighed. "It won't be long. You'll 
be up and around before you 
know it." 

"Back on the moon-run, 
maybe?" he offered. "Listen, 
Martha, I been planet-bound too 
long. I'm not too old for the moon- 
run, am I? Sixty- three's not so 
old." 

That had been carrying things 
too far. She knew he was hoaxing, 
and dabbed at her eyes again. 
The dead must humor the mourn- 
ers, he thought, and the sick must 
comfort the visitors. It was always 
so. 

But it was harder, now that the 
end was near. His eyes were 
hazy, and his thoughts unclear. 
He could move his arms a little, 
clumsily, but feeling was gone 
from them. The rest of his body 
was lost to him. Sometimes he 
seemed to feel his stomach and 
his hips, but the sensation was 



mostly an illusion offered by j 

higher nervous centers, like the I 

"ghost-arm" that an amputee j 
continues to feel. The wires were 
down, and he was cut off from 

himself. \ 

He lay wheezing on the hospital j 
bed, in his own room, in his own j 
rented flat. Gaunt and unshaven, ; 
gray as winter twilight, he lay 
staring at the white net curtains 
that billowed gently in the breeze 
from the open window. There was 
no sound in the room but the 
sound of breathing and the loud 
ticking of an alarm clock. Occa- 
sionally he heard a chair scraping 
on the stone terrace next door, 
and the low mutter of voices, 
sometimes laughter, as the serv- 
ants of the Keith mansion ar- 
ranged the terrace for late after- 
noon guests. 

With considerable effort, he 
rolled his head toward Martha 
who sat beside the bed, pinch- 
faced and weary. 

"You ought to get some sleep," 
he said. 

"I slept yesterday. Don't talk, 
Donny. It tires you." 

"You ought to get more sleep. 
You never sleep enough. Are you 
afraid I'll get up and run away if 
you go to sleep for awhile?" 

She managed a brittle smile. 
"There'll be plenty of time for 
sleep when . . . when you're well 
again." The brittle smile fled and 
she swallowed hard, like swallow-

ing a fish-bone. He glanced down, 
and noticed that she was squeez- 
ing his hand spasmodically. 

There wasn't much left of the 
hand, he thought. Bones and ugly 
tight-stretched hide spotted with 
brown. Bulging knuckles with 
yellow cigaret stains. My hand. 
He tried to tighten it, tried to 
squeeze Martha's thin one in 
return. He watched it open and 
contract a little, but it was like 
operating a remote-control mech- 
anism. Goodbye, hand, you're 
leaving me the way my legs did, 
he told it. I'll see you again in 
hell. How hammy can you get, 
Old Donegal? You maudlin ass. 

" Requiescat," he muttered 
over the hand, and let it lie in 
peace. 

Perhaps she heard him. 
"Donny," she whispered, leaning 
closer, "won't you let me call the 
priest now? Please." 

He rattled a sigh and rolled his 
head toward the window again. 
"Are the Keiths having a party 
today?" he asked. "Sounds like 
they're moving chairs out on the 
terrace." 

"Please, Donny, the priest?" 

He let his head roll aside and 
closed his eyes, as if asleep. The 
bed shook slightly as she quickly 
caught at his wrist to feel for a 
pulse. 

"If I'm not dying, I don't need 
a priest," he said sleepily. 

"That's not right," she scolded 
softly. "You know that's not 



right, Donny. You know better." 

Maybe I'm being too'rough on 
her? he wondered. He hadn't 
minded getting baptized her way, 
and married her way, and occa- 
sionally priest-handled the way 
she wanted him to when he was 
home from a space-run, but when 
it came to dying, Old Donegal 
wanted to do it his own way. 

He opened his eyes at the sound 
of a bench being dragged across 
the stone terrace. "Martha, what 
kind of a party are the Keith's 
having today?" 

"I wouldn't know," she said 
stiffly. "You'd think they'd have 
a little more respect. You'd think 
they'd put it off a few days." 

"Until—?" 

" Until you feel better." 

"I feel fine, Martha. I like 
parties. I'm glad they're having 
one. Pour me a drink, will you? 
I can't reach the bottle anymore." 

"It's empty." 

"No it isn't, Martha, it's still a 
quarter full. I know. I've been 
watching it." 

"You shouldn't have it, Donny. 
Please don't." 

"But this is a party, Martha. 
Besides, the doctor says I can 
have whatever I want. Whatever 
I want, you hear? That means 
I'm getting well, doesn't it?" 

"Sure, Donny, sure. Getting 
well." 

"The whiskey, Martha. Just a 
finger in a tumbler, no more. I

want to feel like it's a party." 

Her throat was rigid as she 
poured it. She helped him get the 
tumbler to his mouth. The liquor 
seared his throat, and he gagged 
a little as the fumes clogged his 
nose. Good whiskey, the best — 
but he couldn't take it any more. 
He eyed the green stamp on the 
neck of the bottle on the bed- 
table and grinned. He hadn't had 
whiskey like that since his space- 
days. Couldn't afford it now, not 
on a blastman's pension. 

He remembered how he and 
Caid used to smuggle a couple of 
fifth saboard for the moon-run. 
If they caught you, it meant sus- 
pension, , but there was no harm 
in it, not for the blastroom men 
who had nothing much to do from 
the time the ship acquired enough 
velocity for the long, long coaster 
ride until they started the rockets 
again for Lunar landing. You 
could drink a fifth, jettison the 
bottle through the trash lock, and 
sober up before you were needed 
again. It was the only way to pass 
the time in the cramped cubicle, 
unless you ruined your eyes trying 
to read by the glow-lamps. Old 
Donegal chuckled. If he and Caid 
had stayed on the run, Earth 
would have a ring by now, like 
Saturn — a ring of Old Granddad 
bottles. 

"You said it, D6nny-boy," said 
the misty man by the billowing 
curtains. "Who else knows the 

10 



Gegenschein is broken glass?" 

Donegal laughed. Then he won- 
dered what the man was doing 
there. The man was lounging 
against the window, and his un- 
zipped space rig draped about him 
in an old familiar way. Loose 
plug-in connections and hose-ends 
dangled about his lean body. He 
was freckled and grinning. 

"Caid," Old Donegal breathed 
softly. 

"What did you say, Donny?" 
Martha answered. 

Old Donegal blinked hard and 
shook his head. Something let go 
with a soggy snap, and the misty 
man was gone. I'd better take it 
easy on the whiskey, he thought. 
You got to wait, Donegal, old 
lush, until Nora and Ken get here. 
You can't get drunk until they're 
gone, or you might get them 
mixed up with memories like 
Caid's. 

Car doors slammed in the street 
below. Martha glanced toward the 
window. 

"Think it's them? I wish they'd 
get here. I wish they'd hurry." 

Martha arose and tiptoed to 
the window. She peered down 
toward the sidewalk, put on a 
sharp frown. He heard a distant 
mutter of voices and occasional 
laughter, with group-footsteps 
milling about on the sidewalk. 
Martha murmured her disap- 
proval and closed the window. 

"Leave it open," he said. 

"But the Keith's guests are 

 



starting to come. There'll be such 
a racket." She looked at him 
hopefully, the way she did when 
she prompted his manners before 
company came. 

Maybe it wasn't decent to lis- 
ten in on a party when you were 
dying, he thought. But that 
wasn't the reason. Donegal, your 
chamber-pressure's dropping off. 
Your brains are in your butt-end, 
where a spacers brains belong, but 
your butt-end died last month. 
She wants the window closed for 
her own sake, not yours. 

"Leave it closed," he grunted. 
"But open it again before the 
moon-run blasts off. I want to 
listen." 

She smiled and nodded, glanc- 
ing at the clock. "It'll be an hour 
and a half yet. I'll watch the 
time." 

"I hate that clock. I wish you'd 
throw it out. It's loud." 

"It's your medicine-clock, 
Donny." She came back to sit 
down at his bedside again. She 
sat in silence. The clock filled the 
room with its clicking pulse. 

"What time are they coming?" 
he asked. 

"Nora and Ken? They'll be 
here soon. Don't fret." 

"Why should I fret?" He 
chuckled. "That boy — he'll be a 
good spacer, won't he, Martha?" 

Martha said nothing, fanned at 
a fly that crawled across his pil- 
low. The fly buzzed up in an an- 
gry spiral and alighted on the 



ceiling. Donegal watched it for a 
time. The fly had natural-born 
space-legs. I know your tricks, he 
told it with a smile, and I learned 
to walk on the bottomside of 
things before you were a maggot. 
You stand there with your mag- 
nasoles hanging to the hull, and 
the rest of you's in free fall. You 
jerk a sole loose, and your knee 
flies up to your belly, and reaction 
spins you half-around and near 
throws your other hip out of 
joint if you don't jam the foot 
down fast and jerk up the other. 
It's worse'n trying to run through 
knee-deep mud with snow-shoes, 
and a man'll go nuts trying to 
keep his arms and legs from taking 
off in odd directions. I know your 
tricks, fly. But the fly was born 
with his magnasoles, and he 
trotted across the ceiling like 
Donegal never could. 

"That boy Ken — he ought to 
make a damn good space-engi- 
neer," wheezed the old man. 

Her silence was long, and he 
rolled his head toward her again. 
Her lips tight, she stared down at 
the palm of his hand, unfolded his 
bony fingers, felt the cracked 
calluses that still welted the 
shrunken skin, calluses worn there 
by the linings of space gauntlets 
and the handles of fuel valves, and 
the rungs of get-about ladders 
during free fall. 

"I don't know if I should tell 
you," she said. 

"Tell me what, Martha?"

She looked up slowly, scruti- 
nizing his face. "Ken's changed 
his mind, Nora says. Ken doesn't 
like the academy. She says he 
wants to go to medical school." 

Old Donegal thought it over, 
nodded absently. "That's fine. 
Space medics get good pay." He 
watched her carefully. 

She lowered her eyes, rubbed 
at his calluses again. She shook 
her head slowly. "He doesn't 
want to go to space." 

The clock clicked loudly in the 
closed room. 

"I thought I ought to tell you, 
so you won't say anything to him 
about it," she added. 

Old Donegal looked grayer than 
before. After a long silence, he 
rolled his head away and looked 
toward the limp curtains. 

"Open the window, Martha," 
he said. 

Her tongue clucked faintly as 
she started to protest, but she 
said nothing. After frozen seconds, 
she sighed and went to open it. 
The curtains billowed, and a 
babble of conversation blew in 
from the terrace of the Keith 
mansion. With the sound came 
the occasional brassy discord of a 
musician tuning his instrument. 
She clutched the window-sash as 
if she wished to slam it closed 
again. 

"Well! Music!" grunted Old 
Donegal. "That's good. This is 
some shebang. Good whiskey and 
good music and you." He chuckled, 



but it choked off into a fit of 
coughing. i 

"Donny, about Ken — " j 

"No matter, Martha," he said 
hastily. "Space-medic's pay is 
good." | 

"But Donny—" She turned j 
from the window, stared at him 
briefly, then said, "Sure, Donny, 
sure," and came back to sit down | 
by his bed. 1 

He smiled at her affectionately. 
She was a man's woman, was 
Martha — always had been, still 
was. He had married her the year 
he had gone to space — a lissome, 
wistful, old fashioned lass, with 
big violet eyes and gentle hands 
and gentle thoughts — and she 
had never complained about the 
long and lonely weeks between 
blast-off and glide-down, when 
most spacer's wives listened to the 
psychiatrists and soap-operas and 
soon developed the symptoms 
that were expected of them, either 
because the symptoms were chic, 
or because they felt they should 
do something to earn the pity 
that was extended to them. "It's 
not so bad," Martha had assured 
him. "The house keeps me busy 
till Nora's home from school, and 
then there's a flock of kids around 
till dinner. Nights are a little 
empty, but if there's a moon, I 
can always go out on the porch 
and look at it and know where 
you are. And Nora gets out the 
telescope you built her, and we 
make a game of it. 'Seeing if 



12 



 



Daddy's still at the office ' she calls 
it." 

"Those "were the days," he 
muttered. 

"What, Donny?" 

"Do you remember that Steve 
Farran song? " 

She paused, frowning thought- 
fully. There were a lot of Steve 
Farran songs, but after a moment 
she picked the right one, and sang 
it softly . . . 

"O moon whereo'er the clouds fly, 
Beyond the willow tree, 
There is a ramblin' space guy 
I wish you'd save for me." 

"Mare Tranquilitatis, 
O dark and tranquil sea, 
Until he drops from heaven, 
Rest him there with thee ..." 

Her voice cracked, and she 
laughed. Old Donegal chuckled 
weakly. 

"Fried mush," he said. "That 
one made the cats wilt their ears 
and wail at the moon." 

"I feel real crazy," he added. 
"Hand me the king kong, fluff- 
muff." 

"Keep cool, Daddy-O, you've 
had enough." Martha reddened 
and patted his arm, looking 
pleased. Neither of them had 
talked that way, even in the old 
days, but the out-dated slang 
brought back memories — school 
parties, dances at the Rocketport 



Club, the early years of the war 
when Donegal had jockeyed an 
R-43 fighter in the close-space 
assaults against the Soviet satel- 
lite project. The memories were 
good. 

A brassy blare of modern 
"slide" arose suddenly from the 
Keith terrace as the small or- 
chestra launched into its first 
number. Martha caught an angry 
breath and started toward the 
window. 

"Leave it," he said. "It's a 
party. Whiskey, Martha. Please 
— just a small one." 

She gave him a hurtful glance. 

"Whiskey. Then you can call 
the priest." 

"Donny, it's not right. You 
know it's not right — to bargain 
for such as that." 

"All right. Whiskey. Forget 
the priest." 

She poured it for him, and 
helped him get it down, and then 
went out to make the phone-call. 
Old Donegal lay shuddering over 
the whiskey taste and savoring 
the burn in his throat. Jesus, but 
it was good. 

You old bastard, he thought, 
you got no right to enjoy life 
when nine-tenths of you is dead 
already, and the rest is foggy as a 
thermal dust-rise on the lunar 
maria at hell-dawn. But it wasn't 
a bad way to die. It ate your 
consciousness away from the feet 
up; it gnawed away the Present, 
but it let you keep the Past, until 



DEATH OF A SPACEMAN

everything faded and blended. 
Maybe that's what Eternity was, 
he thought — one man's subjec- 
tive Past, all wrapped up and 
packaged for shipment, a single 
space-time entity, a one-man mi- 
crocosm of memories, when noth- 
ing else remains. 

"If I've got a soul, I made it 
myself," he told the gray nun at 
the foot of his bed. 

The nun held out a pie pan, 
rattled a few coins in it. "Con- 
tribute to the Radiation Victims' 
Relief?" the nun purred softly. 

"I know you," he said. "You're 
my conscience. You hang around 
the officer's mess, and when we 
get back from a sortie, you make 
us pay for the damage we did. 
But that was forty years ago." 

The nun smiled, and her lumi- 
nous eyes were on him softly. 
"Mother of God!" he breathed, 
and reached for the whiskey. His 
arm obeyed. The last drink had 
done him good. He had to watch 
his hand to see where it was going, 
and squeezed the neck until his 
fingers whitened so that he knew 
that he had it, but he got it off the 
table and onto his chest, and he 
got the cork out with his teeth. 
He had a long pull at the bottle, 
and it made his eyes water and his 
hands grow weak. But he got it 
back to the table without spilling 
a bit, and he was proud of him- 
self. 

The room was spinning like the 
cabin of a gyro-grawed ship. By 



] 

the time he wrestled it to a stand- 
still, the nun was gone. The blare 
of music from the Keith terrace 
was louder, and laughing voices 
blended with it. Chairs scraping 
and glasses rattling. A fine party, 
Keith, I'm glad you picked today. 
This shebang would be the younger 
Keith's affair. Ronald Tonwyler 
Keith, HI, scion of Orbital Engi- 
neering and Construction Com- 
pany — builders of the moon- 
shuttle ships that made the run 
from the satellite station to Luna 
and back. 

It's good to have such impor- 
tant neighbors, he thought. He 
wished he had been able to meet 
them while he was still up and 
about. But the Keith's place was 
walled-in, and when a Keith came 
out, he charged out in a limousine 
with a chauffeur at the wheel, and 
the iron gate closed again. The 
Keiths built the wall when the 
surrounding neighborhood began 
to grow shabby with age. It had 
once been the best of neighbor- 
hoods, but that was before Old 
Donegal lived in it. Now it con- 
sisted of sooty old houses and 
rented flats, and the Keith place 
was really not a part of it any- 
more. Nevertheless, it was really 
something when a pensioned blast- 
man could say, "I live out close 
to the Keiths — you know, the 
Ronald Keiths." At least, that's 
what Martha always told him. 

The music was so loud that he 
never heard the doorbell ring, but 



14 



 



when a lull came, he heard Nora's 
voice downstairs, and listened 
hopefully for Ken's. But when 
they came up, the boy was not 
with them. 

"Hello, skinny-britches," he 
greeted his daughter. 

Nora grinned and came over to 
kiss him. Her hair dangled about 
his face, and he noticed that it 
was blacker than usual, with the 
gray streaks gone from it again. 

"You smell good," he said. 

"You don't, Pops. You smell 
like a sot. Naughty!" 

"Where's Ken?" 

She moistened her lips nerv- 
ously and looked away. "He 
couldn't come. He had to take a 
driver's lesson. He really couldn't 
help it. If he didn't go, he'd lose 
his turn, and then he wouldn't 
finish before he goes back to the 
academy." She looked at him 
apologetically. 

"It's all right, Nora." 

"If he missed it, he wouldn't 
get his copter license until sum- 
mer." 

"It's okay. Copters! Hell, the 
boy should be in jets by now!" 

Several breaths passed in si- 
lence. She gazed absently toward 
the window and shook her head. 
"No jets, Pop. Not for Ken." 

He glowered at her. "Listen! 
How'll he get into space? He's 
got to get his jet licenses first. 
Can't get in rockets without 'em." 

Nora shot a quick glance at her 
mother. Martha rolled her eyes 

DEATH OF A SPACEMAN 



as if sighing patiently. Nora went 
to the window to stare down to- 
ward the Keith terrace. She 
tucked a cigaret between scarlet 
lips, lit it, blew nervous smoke 
against the pane. 

"Mom, can't you call them 
and have that racket stopped?" 

"Donny says he likes it." 

Nora's eyes flitted over the 
scene below. "Female butterflies 
and puppy-dogs in sport jackets. 
And the cadets." She snorted. 
"Cadets! Imagine Ron Keith the 
Third ever going to space. The 
old man buys his way into the 
academy, and they throw a brawl 
as if Ronny passed the Compets." 

"Maybe he did," growled Old 
Donegal. 

"Hah!" 

"They live in a different world, 
I guess," Martha sighed. 

"If it weren't for men like 
Pops, they'd never' ve made their 
fortune." 

"I like the music, I tell you," 
grumbled the old man. 

"I'm half-a-mind to go over 
there and tell them off," Nora 
murmured. 

"Let them alone. Just so they'll 
stop the racket for blast-away." 

"Look at them! — polite little 
pattern-cuts, all alike. They take 
pre-space, because it's the thing to 
do. Then they quit before the 
pay-off comes." 

"How do you know they'll 
quit?" 

"That party — I bet it cost 

15 



six months' pay, spacer's pay," 
she went on, ignoring him. "And 
what do real spacer's get? Oley 
gets killed, and Pop's pension 
wouldn't feed the Keith's cat." 

"You don't understand, girl." 

"I lost Oley. I understand 
enough." 

He watched her silently for a 
moment, then closed his eyes. It 
was no good trying to explain, no 
good trying to tell her the dough 
didn't mean a damn thing. She'd 
been a spacer's wife, and that was 
bad enough, but now she was a 
spacer's widow. And Oley? Oley's 
tomb revolved around the sun in 
an eccentric orbit that spun-in 
close to Mercury, then reached 
out into the asteroid belt, once 
every 725 days. When it came 
within rocket radius of Earth, it 
whizzed past at close to fifteen 
miles a second. 

You don't rescue a ship like 
that, skinny-britches, my darling 
daughter. Nor do you salvage it 
after the crew stops screaming for 
help. If you use enough fuel to 
catch it, you won't get back. You 
just leave such a ship there for- 
ever, like an asteroid, and it's a 
damn shame about the men 
trapped aboard. Heroes all, no 
doubt — but the smallness of the 
widow's monthly check failed to 
confirm the heroism, and Nora 
was bitter about the price of 
Oley's memory, perhaps. 
Ouch! Old Donegal, you know 

16 



she's not like that. It's just that 
she can't understand about space. 
You ought to make her under- 
stand. 

But did he really understand 
himself? You ride hot in a roaring 
blast-room, hands tense on the 
mixer controls and the pumps, 
eyes glued to instruments, body 
sucked down in a four-gravity 
thrust, and wait for the command 
to choke it off. Then you float free 
and weightless in a long nightmare 
as the beast coasts moon ward, a 
flung javelin. 

The "romance" of space — 
drivel written in the old days. 
When you're not blasting, you 
float in a cramped hotbox, crawl 
through dirty mazes of greasy 
pipe and cable to tighten a lug, 
scratch your arms and bark your 
shins, get sick and choked up be- 
cause no gravity helps your gullet 
get the food down. Liquid is 
worse, but you gag your whiskey 
down because you have to. 

Stars? — you see stars by 
squinting through a viewing lens, 
and it's like a photo-transparency, 
and if you aren't careful, you'll 
get an eyeful of Old Blinder and 
back off with a punch-drunk 
retina. 

Adventure? — unless the skip- 
per calls for course-correction, 
you float around in the blast- 
cubicle with damn little to do be- 
tween blast-away and moon-down, 
except sweat out the omniscient 
accident statistics. If the beast 

 



blows up or gets gutted in space, a 
statistic had your name on it, 
that's all, and there's no fighting 
back. You stay outwardly sane 
because you're a hog for punish- 
ment; if you weren't, you'd never 
get past the psychologists. 

"Did you like horror movies 
when you were a kid?" asked the 
psych. And you'd damn well bet- 
ter answer "yes," if you want to 
go to space. 

Tell her, old man, you're her 
pop. Tell her why it's worth it, 
if you know. You jail yourself in a 
coffin-size cubicle, and a crazy 
beast thunders berserk for un- 
controllable seconds, and then 
you soar in ominous silence for the 
long long hours. Grow sweaty, 
filthy, sick, miserable, idle — • 
somewhere out in Big Empty, 
where Man's got no business 
except the trouble he always 
makes for himself wherever he 
goes. Tell her why it's worth it, 
for pay less than a good brick- 
layer's. Tell her why Oley would 
do it again. 

"It's a sucker's run, Nora," he 
said. "You go looking for kicks, 
but the only kicks you get to keep 
is what Oley got. God knows why 
— but it's worth it." 

Nora said nothing. He opened 
his eyes slowly. Nora was gone. 
Had she been there at all? 

He blinked around at the fuzzy 
room, and dissolved the shifting 
shadows that sometimes emerged 



as old friendly faces, grinning at 
him. He found Martha. 

"You went to sleep," said Martha. 
"She had to go. Kennie called. 
He'll be over later, if you're not 
too tired." 

"I'm not tired. I'm all head. 
There's nothing much to get tired." 

"I love you, Old Donegal." 

"Hold my hand again." 

"I'm holding it, old man." 

"Then hold me where I can feel 
it." 

She slid a thin arm under his 
neck, and bent over his face to 
kiss him. She was crying a little, 
and he was glad she could do it 
now without fleeing the room. 

"Can I talk about dying now? " 
he wondered aloud. 

She pinched her lips together 
and shook her head. 

"I lie to myself, Martha. You 
know how much I lie to myself?" 

She nodded slowly and stroked 
his gray temples. 

"I lie to myself about Ken, and 
about dying. If Ken turned spacer, 
I wouldn't die — that's what I 
told myself. You know?" 

She shook her head. "Don't 
talk, Donny, please." 

"A man makes his own soul, 
Martha." 

"That's not true. You shouldn't 
say things like that." 

"A man makes his own soul, 
but it dies with him, unless he can 
pour it into his kids and his grand- 
children before he goes. I lied to 
myself. Ken's a yellow-belly. Nora

made him one, and the boots 
won't fit." 

"Don't, Donny. You'll excite 
yourself again." 

"I was going to give him the 
boots — the over-boots with mag- 
nasoles. But they won't fit him. 
They won't ever fit him. He's a 
lily-livered lap-dog, and he whines. 
Bring me my boots, woman." 

"Donny!" 

"The boots, they're in my locker 
in the attic. I want them." 

"What on earth!" 

"Bring me my goddam space 
boots and put them on my feet. 
I'm going to wear them." 

"You can't; the priest's com- 
ing." 

"Well, get them anyway. What 
time is it? You didn't let me sleep 
through the moon-run blast, did 
you?" 

She shook her head. "It's half 
an hour yet . . . I'll get the 
boots if you promise not to make 
me put them on you." 

"I want them on." 

"You can't, until Father Paul's 
finished." 

"Do I have to get my feet 
buttered?" 

She sighed. "I wish you wouldn't 
say things like that. I wish you 
wouldn't, Donny. It's sacrilege, 
you know it is." 

"All right — 'annointed'," he 
corrected wearily. 

"Yes, you do." 

"The boots, woman, the boots." 
She wejnt to get them. While she 



was gone, the doorbell rang, and 
he heard her quick footsteps on 
the stairs, and then Father Paul's 
voice asking about the patient. 
Old Donegal groaned inwardly. 
After the priest, the doctor would 
come, at the usual time, to see if 
he were dead yet. The doctor had 
let him come home from the hospi- 
tal to die, and the doctor was 
getting impatient. Why don't they 
let me alone? he growled. Why 
don't they let me handle it in my 
own way, and stop making a fuss 
over it? I can die and do a good 
job of it without a lot of outside 
interference, and I wish they'd 
quit picking at me with syringes 
and sacraments and enemas. All 
he wanted was a chance to listen 
to the orchestra on the Keith ter- 
race, to drink the rest of his 
whiskey, and to hear the beast 
blast-away for the satellite on the 
first lap of the run to Luna. 

It's going to be my last day, he 
thought. My eyes are going fuzzy, 
and I can't breathe right, and the 
throbbing's hurting my head. 
Whether he lived through the 
night wouldn't matter, because 
delirium was coming over him, 
and then there would be the coma, 
and the symbolic fight to keep him 
pumping and panting. I'd rather 
die tonight and get it over with, 
he thought, but they probably 
won't let me go. 

He heard their voices coming up 
the stairs . . . 



18 



 



"Nora tried to get them to stop 
it, Father, but she couldn't get in 
to see anybody but the butler. He 
told her he'd tell Mrs. Keith, but 
nothing happened. It's just as 
loud as before." 

"Well, as long as Donny doesn't 
mind—" 

"He just says that. You know 
how he is." 

"What're they celebrating, 
Martha?" 

"Young Ronald's leaving — for 
pre-space training. It's a going- 
away affair." They paused in the 
doorway. The small priest smiled 
in at Donegal and nodded. He set 
his black bag on the floor inside, 
winked solemnly at the patient. 

"I'll leave you two alone," said 
Martha. She closed the door and 
her footsteps wandered off down 
the hall. 

Donegal and the young priest 
eyed each other warily. 

"You look like hell, Donegal," 
the padre offered jovially. "Feel- 
ing nasty?" 

"Skip the small talk. Let's get 
this routine over with." 

The priest humphed thought- 
fully, sauntered across to the bed, 
gazed down at the old man disin- 
terestedly. "What's the matter? 
Don't want the 'routine'? Rather 
play it tough?" 

"What's the difference?" he 
growled. "Hurry up and get out. I 
want to hear the beast blast off." 

"You won't be able to," said 
the priest, glancing at the window, 



now closed again. "That's quite a 
racket next door." 

"They'd better stop for it. 
They'd better quiet down for it. 
They'll have to turn it off for five 
minutes or so." 

"Maybe they won't." 

It was a new idea, and it fright- 
ened him. He liked the music, and 
the party's gaiety, the nearness of 
youth and good times — but it 
hadn't occurred to him that it 
wouldn't stop so he could hear the 
beast. 

"Don't get upset, Donegal. You 
know what a blast-off sounds 
like." 

"But it's the last one. The last 
time. I want to hear." 

How do you know it's the last 
time?" 

"Hell, don't I know when I'm 
kicking off?" 

"Maybe, maybe not. It's hardly 
your decision." 

"It's not, eh?" Old Donegal 
fumed. "Well, bigawd you'd think 
it wasn't. You'd think it was 
Martha's and yours and that 
damfool medic's. You'd think I 
got no say-so. Who's doing it any- 
way?" 

"I would guess," Father Paul 
grunted sourly, "that Providence 
might appreciate His fair share of 
the credit." 

Old Donegal made a surly noise 
and hunched his head back into 
the pillow to glower. 

"You want me?" the priest 
asked. "Or is this just a case of 



DEATH OF A SPACEMAN 



19 



wifely conscience?" 

"What's the difference? Give 
me the business and scram." 

"No soap. Do you want the 
sacrament, or are you just being 
kind to your wife? If it's for 
Martha, I'll go now." 

Old Donegal glared at him for a 
time, then wilted. The priest 
brought his bag to the bedside. 

"Bless me, father, for I have 
sinned." 

"Bless you, son." 

"I accuse myself ..." 

Tension, anger, helplessness — 
they had piled up on him, and now 
he was feeling the after-effects. 
Vertigo, nausea, and the black 
confetti — a bad spell. The whis- 
key — if he could only reach the 
whiskey. Then he remembered he 
was receiving a Sacrament, and 
struggled to get on with it. Tell 
him, old man, tell him of your 
various rottennesses and vile trans- 
gressions, if you can remember 
some. A sin is whatever you're 
sorry for, maybe. But Old Done- 
gal, you're sorry for the wrong 
things, and this young Jesuitical 
gadget wouldn't like listening to 
it. I'm sorry I didn't get it instead 
of Oley, and I'm sorry I fought in 
the war, and I'm sorry I can't get 
out of this bed and take a belt to 
my daughter's backside for mak- 
ing a puny whelp out of Ken, and 
I'm sorry I gave Martha such a 
rough time all these years — and 
wound up dying in a cheap flat, 



instead of giving her things like 
the Keith's had. I wish I had been 
a sharpster, contractor, or thief 
. . . instead of a common labor- 
ing spacer, whose species lost its 
glamor after the war. 

Listen, old man, you made your 
soul yourself, and it's yours. This 
young dispenser of oils, Substances, 
and mysteries wishes only to help 
you scrape off the rough edges and 
gouge out the bad spots. He will 
not steal it, nor distort it with his 
supernatural chisels, nor make 
fun of it. He can take nothing 
away, but only cauterize and neu- 
tralize, he says, so, why not let 
him try? Tell him the rotten 
messes. 

"Are you finished, my son?" 

Old Donegal nodded wearily, 
and said what he was asked to 
say, and heard the soft mutter of 
Latin that washed him inside and 
behind his ghostly ears . . . ego 
te absolvo in Nomine Patris . . . 
and he accepted the rest of it ly- 
ing quietly in the candlelight and 
the red glow of the sunset through 
the window, while the priest an- 
nointed him and gave him Bread, 
and read the words of the soul in 
greeting its Spouse : " I was asleep, 
but my heart waked; it is the 
voice of my beloved calling: come 
to me my love, my dove, my un- 
defiled . . ." and from beyond 
the closed window came the sar- 
castic wail of a clarinet painting 
hot slides against a rythmic back- 
ground. 



20 



 



It wasn't so bad, Old Donegal 
thought when the priest was done. 
He felt like a schoolboy in a 
starched shirt on Sunday morning, 
and it wasn't a bad feeling, though 
it left him weak. 

The priest opened the window 
for him again, and repacked his 
bag. "Ten minutes till blast- 
off," he said. "I'll see what I can 
do about the racket next door." 

When he was gone, Martha 
came back in, and he looked at 
her face and was glad. She was 
smiling when she kissed him, and 
she looked less tired. 

"Is it all right for me to die 
now?" he grunted. 

"Donny, don't start that 
again." 

"Where's the boots? You prom- 
iscd to bring them?" 



"They're in the hall. Donny, 
you don't want them." 

"I want them, and I want a 
drink of whiskey, and I want to 
hear them fire the beast." He said 
it slow and hard, and he left 
no room for argument. 

When she had got the huge 
boots over his shrunken feet, the 
magnasoles clanged against the 
iron bed-frame and clung there, 
and she rolled him up so that he 
could look at them, and Old 
Donegal chuckled inside. He felt 
warm and clean and pleasantly 
dizzy. 

"The whiskey, Martha, and for 
God's sake, make them stop the 
noise till after the firing. Please!" 

She went to the window and 
looked out for a long time. Then

THE 

DOUBLE 
SPY 

By Dan T. Moore 



Meet the man with no name. Noth- 
ing cool about this cat. He was built 
along the lines -of a necktie rack, 
weighed slightly more than a used 
napkin, and was as shy as the ante 
in a crooked poker game. 

No sex appeal there, you'd say. 
Yet within the space of a few days 
every woman in the country melted 
into quivering protoplasm at the 
very thought of this mystery man! 



22 



 



DEAR excellency: 

The communicating time will 
be here soon. I have started this 
letter early to be sure it will be 
ready. This is the first time I have 
felt safe when communicating 
with you. Our enemies at home 
can solve such extraordinarily 
complex ciphers that I have al- 
ways been uneasy before. They 
cannot possibly solve an entirely 
new language like this one; a 
language based on an utterly 
different theory from our own; 
with new symbols; and even set 
down with a different writing 
instrument. Our long periods of 
study together have brought their 
reward. Your Excellency, I ap- 
preciate the rare privilege of 
knowing a language that only 
one other person at home knows, 
and that one person, yourself. 

I am having many dangers and 
horrors in America. As we both 
realized, it is impossible to carry 
out my mission without lots of 



their money. I could not even 
begin my work, nor buy the 
expensive equipment needed for 
my experiments without finding 
a way to make money. 

In only a few weeks I dis- 
covered the quickest and easiest 
way to do it was to become an 
entertainer. The people here like 
to be shocked and astonished. 
Naturally I am well equipped to 
do both. I was an immediate 
sensation. I got into what New 
Yorkers call "The Big Time." 
. Each night at 8:30 I went to a 
theatre in a place called Times 
Square and put on my act. 
Thousands of people paid to see 
me. I was very well paid. There 
is a newspaper here called "Vari- 
ety." It carried an article about 
me. The headline said: STRONG 
MAN TERRIF WOW SOCK- 
EROO 100G 3D. The numbers 
at the end mean the theatre 
took in $100,000 during my third 
week. After the article appeared 
every seat was sold weeks in 
advance. 

You will be amused, Excellency, 
when you hear what I did in this 
show. I came out on the stage 
practically nude except for an ab- 
breviated leopard skin. I walked 
over to a pile of iron rods. They 
were half-inch concrete reinforc- 
ing bars about six feet long. I 
picked one out and dropped it 
on the floor. It made a terrible 
crash. This was to prove to the 
audience that it was real. Then 



I wrapped it around my neck and 
tied it in a regular four-in-hand 
necktie knot. It was a little hard 
to get the ends to come out even. 
I had to pull and haul to arrange 
them just right. This caused 
tremendous laughter. They knew 
no one could do this with an iron 
reinforcing bar. They were sure 
it was a trick. 

I chose the man in the audience 
who was laughing the loudest 
and asked him to come up on the 
stage. With a little persuasion he 
did so. I selected another iron 
bar and wrapped it around his 
neck. Then I tied it in a four-in- 
hand knot and adjusted the ends 
until they were perfect. I asked 
him to take the necktie off. He 
grabbed it with both hands and 
tried. His face turned purple with 
effort, but of course he could not 
even budge it. Everyone laughed 
loudly. Finally twenty men from 
the audience volunteered to help. 
They all started pulling and haul- 
ing. They couldn't get the iron 
necktie off. Then the audience 
became silent. They looked at 
each other uneasily. There were 
frightened whispers. 

That was the time to break 
the tension. I would spit on the 
floor. As my saliva hit the stage 
it burst into flames and a smell 
of perfume drifted through the 
theatre. It was my turn to look 
surprised and scared. Everyone 
howled with laughter, and the 



24 



 



tension was broken for all but 
the man with the iron necktie 
who remained forlorn and miser- 
able. Finally I removed his neck- 
tie and let it drop to the floor. 
It made a tremendous crash. 
Everyone was impressed all over 
again. 

Next I grasped a horizontal 
bar and chinned myself fifty 
times with one hand. Again every- 
one became silent. They all knew 
no one has ever done that before. 
In many ways they are like us. 
For example, when they get scared 
their body heat rises like ours. 
As the heat came up to me from 
the audience I could feel the 
change in my sensors. It made my 
chin warm. I found that when my 
chin got warm it was time to 
break the tension. I did it by 
demonstrating magic tricks. 

You will smile, Excellency, 
when you hear what they call 
magic here. I was tightly blind- 
folded. Some people came up 
on the stage, and I announced 
exactly how many there were. 
I pointed to exactly where each 
one was standing, and indicated 
which were males and which 
were females. This made a most 
tremendous impression. I could 
hear gasps in the audience. I 
was told that the people rubbed 
their eyes as if they could not 
believe what they were seeing. 
You will understand, Excellency, 
that I accomplished this by turn- 
ing on the male principle. The 

THE DOUBLE SPY 



women here are so exquisitely 
receptive to it that ' when it 
is on their excitement causes 
changes in their body heat. It 
was simple for me to sense those 
fluctuations in temperature and 
to know which of the people 
before me were female. 

Next I put a piece of paper 
on a metal rack across the stage. 
I concentrated heat waves on it 
from my cupped hand. The paper 
burst into flames. As they say 
here on the street they call Broad- 
way, that "brought down the 
house." They clapped and whis- 
tled and made me do it again 
and again. Luckily they con- 
ceived of it only as a wonderful 
trick. 

I ended the act by choosing a 
very unusual looking man from 
the audience. He came up on 
stage and we went behind a 
screen together. When we re- 
appeared a few seconds later the 
audience screamed because I had 
twisted my face around to look 
exactly like his. Believe me, the 
reaction was terrific. Slowly I 
let my face slip back to "normal." 
If they realized there is no normal 
and that I could leave my face 
that way permanently, that would 
have been too much of a shock. 
They would have become silent 
and terrified and suspicious. I 
might have been in danger. 

I had to calculate carefully how 
much these people could take 
without realizing there was some- 

25 



thing alarmingly different about 
me. I learned my lesson one 
night. I turned on the male 
principle too strongly and some 
of the women in the audience 
became very agitated. Everyone 
was embarrassed. After the show 
the theatre manager came to my 
dressing room and asked me to 
have a drink with him at a little 
bar across the street. 

When we sat down he stared 
at me in a queer manner. "Just 
exactly what happened tonight?" 
he demanded. 

I looked surprised. "Weren't 
you satisfied with the act?" I 
asked. "The audience seemed to 
like me." 

"They liked you too much." 

I laughed. "You mean those 
silly females who tried to drag me 
off the stage?" 

He narrowed his eyes and thrust 
his face close to mine. "If I 
hadn't had the best-trained ushers 
in New York there'd have been 
a panic and a riot in there. How 
come?" 

I shrugged. "The women in 
your town seem remarkably ex- 
citable." 

"And in your town?" 

"Not so," I declared truthfully. 
How truthfully Your Excellency 
well knows. 

"There's something peculiar 
about you," he said, "something 
very peculiar." He leaned back 
in his chair and his glance swept 



over me. "Suppose you cut out 
the leopard skin," he said, "and 
wear a jersey and trousers." 

I laughed to myself. He thought 
my bare body, my bulging muscles 
had been the cause of the trouble. 
What a fool! Is Your Excellency 
laughing too? However, I dared 
not disagree with him. By that 
time he had had many drinks. He 
was looking mean. He reached 
over and grabbed the lapel of my 
coat in his fist. 

"What the hell kind of a guy 
are you?" he snarled at me. 

My hands twitched. I wished 
I could have picked him up and 
tied him in a four-in-hand knot 
around his own neck. 

"Who the hell are you?" he 
repeated. 

I yawned and stretched and 
got to my feet. "Not even a strong 
man now," I said casually, "just 
a tired man." 

I left the bar. 

After that incident I was care- 
ful with the male principle. When 
the audience left each night I 
turned it on very slightly — only 
enough to be sure that the women 
would do their best to get back 
to see me again. 

But before I go any further in 
this account of my adventures, 
Your Excellency, let me tell you 
about the women here. The great- 
est difference between the Ameri- 
cans and ourselves is in the 
women. They are extraordinary. 
Some of them are beautiful be- 



26 



 



yond belief. My researches com- 
pletely confirm your much-cri- 
ticized hypotheses concerning our 
own women. If our enemies who 
object so strongly to Your Excel- 
lency's statements could be here 
for only one hour they would 
become your devoted supporters. 
American women are the proof 
that your theories are correct. 
Your famous attempt to explain 
some of the incongruous and 
apparently ridiculous passages in 
our ancient manuscripts by as- 
suming the existence of a now- 
vanished female principle is irre- 
futably demonstrated by these 
women, Your Excellency. 

Here, the female principle ex- 
ists, and as you predicted, most 
of the women are therefore en- 
tirely different from ours. The 
term used in this language is 
" femininity." It is a devastatingly 
attractive thing — but almost im- 
possible to explain. I will make an 
attempt. 

Senseless, reasonless, even fool^ 
ish motions of the body and the 
hands, the expressions of the eyes 
and the mouth, the way the head 
is moved and tilted are a part of 
it. So are unusual tones of the 
voice and special ways in which 
things are said. Laughter, a whis- 
per, the direction of the glance, 
the fingers' pressure — these, too, 
are parts of it. 

There are infinitely various 
types of adornment which hang 
on the body, fabrics in delicate 



or brilliant colors which cling 
and flow, gleaming stones at 
throat and wrists. The faces are 
enchantingly painted, the hair 
shining and arranged in numerous 
wonderful designs. There is an 
aura of the scent of flowers and 
fruits. 

I tell you, Excellency, every- 
thing about this femininity assails 
the senses. It is so potent that 
once having experienced it the 
mere recollection causes the pulses 
to pound and throb. My hand 
trembles as I write these words 
to you. I am confused and dis- 
turbed and wild with a longing 
I never knew at home. I wish 
to meet Your Excellency's high 
standards in preparing this re- 
port, and yet I am unable to be 
scientific. The logic of the labora- 
tory cannot be employed. 

As soon as I could I began to 
hunt desperately for the secret 
of the female principle. I analyzed 
the soil, the food, the water, 
and the air by our own most 
refined methods. I found nothing 
to help us. I went to the risky 
extreme of killing two of their 
women. One possessed an unusual 
amount of this femininity. The 
other, who seemed to have very 
little of it, was essentially like 
one of our own women. There 
was not the slightest chemical dif- 
ference in their bodies. Dead, they 
were precisely the same. But 
alive, Your Excellency, they were 
overwhelmingly dissimilar. 



THE DOUBLE SPY 



27 



I was able to kill the unfeminine 
one scientifically without emotion 
or regret. But, although it was 
clearly my duty, I could hardly 
bring myself to kill the other one. 
I had known her for several days. 
Her femininity almost prevented 
my continuing with the experi- 
ment. She told me that she loved 
me. 

I don't know if I have the 
skill to explain to you what this 
"love" is. Briefly, it means that 
the woman was in a mental state 
— a receptive mental state, Excel- 
lency, infinitely more violent than 
the peak our women reach after 
intensive application of the male 
principle. Your Excellency, she 
was that way all of the time. 

This brings me to another ex- 
traordinary difference between 
them and us. The men here lack 
the male principle. They obviously 
don't need it because of the 
existence of the female principle 
in the women. If the men had it, 
as we have, I leave it to Your 
Excellency's vivid imagination as 
to what would be happening here. 

In general the men are enough 
like us to be called humanoids in 
our sense of the word. They 
have about the same intelligence 
quotient that we have, and are 
physically almost identical except 
for our induced modifications. 
As Your Excellency predicted 
they do not have these since 
they have not yet discovered the 



methods of inducing them. As a 
result, while they have the same 
muscular potential as we do, 
they are far weaker, and their 
life span is not more than 70 
or 80 years by their calendar. 

They do not have heat sensors, 
so they stumble around in the 
dark and trip over things like 
children. They squander more 
energy on electric lights than on 
anything else in the economy. 
Also, their hearing and eyesight 
cannot be compared to ours. 
I am always hearing and seeing 
things without their suspecting 
it. A low conversation across the 
room is perfectly audible to me. 
Much of my best information 
comes this way. Naturally, since 
they completely lack heat genera- 
tors, they cannot set things on 
fire. 

To get back to the account of 
my activities, Excellency; my 
biggest mistake was in killing the 
two women for the femininity 
research. This got me into terrible 
trouble. They feel strongly about 
killing women here. Now that I 
appreciate their women, I can 
see why. 

The local police were not hard 
to handle, but they have a central 
police system called the F.B.I. 
It is comparable to Your Excel- 
lency's organization in techniques 
and training, and in some ways 
even superior to it. When the 
F.B.I, started investigating me, 
things got serious immediately.

One day my heat sensor de- 
tected a man standing outside 
my front door. He was a huge 
bulky man. I sensed a mass under 
his left arm pit. My heat sensor 
analyzed it. It reflected heat like 
iron, but there seemed to be some 
small pieces of lead there too. 

The man was polite and apolo- 
getic when I opened the door. He 
tipped his hat. He said that he 
had come to the wrong apartment. 
Then he asked, "How did you 
know I was standing outside the 
door?" 

Without thinking, I uttered 
the first thing that came into 
my head. "I saw your shadow." 

His eyes widened only slightly. 
He had good control of himself. 
"How could you see a shadow 
through a wooden door?" he 
asked softly. 

I was exasperated at my mis- 
take but I smiled the way people 
here do when they are at a dis- 
advantage. "I do not explain my 
tricks," I told him. "I earn my 
living by performing them at the 
theatre." 

I closed the door. 

The next night I was experi- 
menting with the male principle. 
I sat on a bench in a place called 
Central Park and practiced on 
the women as they went by. I 
discovered that the more feminine 
the women the greater the effect 
the wave has on them. Some 
would hesitate and look around 
as they walked by me. Some 



would stop and stare at me in a 
puzzled fashion. I was growing 
tired and ravenously hungry. I 
decided that when the next at- 
tractive woman passed me I 
would generate one last powerful 
wave, and then go on to a res- 
taurant. 

I allowed a few unfeminine 
ones to go by. Then I saw her, a 
lovely blonde girl about twenty- 
five years old. Her hair was a 
mass of short curls that covered 
her head with a uniform thickness 
like the styles in our Second 
Renaissance Period. She had on 
a black dress and was carrying a 
black bag in her hand. I sensed 
small pieces of different types 
of metals in her bag. She was 
walking slowly and weeping. Oc- 
casionally she dabbed at her nose 
with a piece of white cloth. 

She was so beautiful, Excel- 
lency. Her warmth started flowing 
over my chin when she was at 
least sixty feet away. I decided 
to wait until she was quite close 
and then to engulf her with the 
full force of the male principle. 
I was shaken and impatient. 
Even at the highest point of 
excitement, though, Your Excel- 
lency should know that the im- 
portance of my mission was in 
my mind. When she was on the 
sidewalk directly in front of me I 
did as I had planned. She stopped. 
Her handkerchief dropped to the 
ground, and then her bag. She 



THE DOUBLE SPY 



29 



looked at me wildly. She ran over 
and sat on the bench beside me. 
She put her arms around my neck 
and kissed me. 

"Why were you crying?" I 
asked. 

"I don't remember," she said. 
"I don't care." 

I closed my eyes. My senses 
were responding to her warmth 
and her scent. Suddenly there 
was a blast of male heat on my 
chin. I started and stared. There 
standing above us was the huge 
heavy man of the night before. 
The mass of metal was still under 
his left arm pit. He had an odd 
expression on his face. He was 
watching the girl as if her condi- 
tion was answering a question for 
him. 

In a sudden flash of intuition 
everything was clear to me. The 
girl was a decoy. I had fallen 
neatly into a trap. I had thought- 
lessly demonstrated my power to 
the F.B.I, man — a power I could 
not explain by saying it was a 
trick. 

I pushed the girl away and 
stood up. The man's eyes were 
fixed upon me with horror. I 
saw that he knew there was 
something monstrous and menac- 
ing about me. Something he did 
not understand. Something that 
meant terrible danger to him and 
his kind. His right hand started to 
creep towards the mass of metal 
under his arm. I cupped my 
hand towards him and started 



accumulating a heat charge. His 
glance dropped fearfully. It fell 
to my hand, and his temperature 
went up. He had undoubtedly 
seen me burn pieces of paper in 
the theatre. 

His right hand fumbled in his 
pocket and he drew out a little 
package. "Have a cigarette?" 

I shook my head. He put one 
in his own mouth and lighted 
a match. In spite of the strongest 
effort of my will I jumped back. 
I jerked my hand up over my 
chin. A little stick of wood with 
a flaring flame on the end of at 
least 600 degrees Centigrade, right 
in front of my heat sensors, took 
my breath away. The searing 
heat burned right into my brain. 
It was like some of the tortures 
in Your Excellency's Force Num- 
ber Five. 

The heavy man observed all of 
this, but he did not understand 
it. He looked at the girl, who 
had risen and was leaning against 
me, oblivious of everything. 

"You've got quite a way with 
women, haven't you?" he said. 
He dragged on his cigarette. The 
tip flamed up painfully. I shrank 
back and again brought my hand 
up to protect my chin. 

"What's the matter with you?" 
the man asked sharply. 

I did not know how to answer. 
I stood mute and waiting. 

"I want to go now, and I 
want to take that girl with me. 
Do you understand?" The man's 



30 



 



voice was harsh with anger. 

I shut the principle off. The 
girl lifted her head, but she 
appeared to be in a trance. The 
man took her arm and they 
walked off through the park. 
A murderous rage against the 
heavy man filled me. I cupped 
my hand. He was well within 
range ■ — but then I thought of 
my mission, Excellency, and let 
him go. For hours afterwards 
that lovely girl who was taken 
from me was in my thoughts. 

Your Excellency, two sugges- 
tions come out of this experience. 
They both concern our induced 
modifications. Any of us who 
come to America should be able 
to shut off the heat sensor at 
will. With everyone here smoking 
and lighting cigarettes and turn- 
ing on 300-watt light bulbs in 
one's face, with automobiles ap- 
proaching at night shooting out 
two searing heat beams in front 
of them, the environment is too 
full of shocks. It is too easy for 
us to be spotted because of this 
weakness. 

Also, Your Excellency, a change 
must be made in the connection 
between all of the induced modi- 
fications. When I accumulate a 
heat charge, that means that the 
male principle is automatically 
on. When I was accumulating a 
charge to kill the heavy man, 
the principle was affecting the 
woman, and she was reacting to 



it. The combination , was not 
desirable at that time. When I 
light the paper at the theatre, 
the male principle is also on, and 
affects the women in the audience. 
We can use the male principle 
without using the heat ray. Why 
can't we use the heat ray without 
using the male principle? This 
modification should be induced. 

The next afternoon there was 
a matinee performance at the 
theatre. It was crowded. The 
management had even provided 
for standing room at the back 
of the theatre. I started, as usual, 
by selecting an iron reinforcing 
bar and tying it into a four-in- 
hand around my neck. 

To my surprise, although it 
looked exactly the same, it was 
much harder to bend. I never did 
get the ends quite even. 

I had just put the second bar 
around the neck of the stooge 
from the audience when I noticed 
something queer. Although this 
was usually the place for hilarious 
laughter, everyone was silent. I 
looked out over the audience. A 
man was standing in the aisle, 
just a few feet from the stage. 
He was pointing a gun right at 
me. It was the heavy man. 

As I turned around he said, 
"Put up your hands." 

I put them up. 

He spoke in a loud, deep voice, 
"This is no gag, ladies and gentle- 
men. This man on the stage is 
the most dangerous and cold- 



THE DOUBLE SPY 



31 



blooded murderer in America. 
He is the murderer of Lydia 
Davis and Genevieve Scott." 

Several other men stood up. 
They all had masses of metal 
under their left arm pits. The 
heavy man gave them an order. 
"Go up on the stage and hand- 
cuff him. Use five pairs of hand- 
cuffs." 

Then he spoke to the audience. 
"Ladies and gentlemen, today 
we substituted tempered steel 
bars for the reinforcing bars. 
Twenty ordinary men couldn't 
have bent one of those bars. 
What you have witnessed was 
no trick. The man you see on 
the stage is not like us. He has 
the strength of at least forty 
men. Please remain in your seats. 
We can handle this situation." 

The audience gasped and mur- 
mured. A woman screamed. 

The group of men started walk- 
ing towards the stage. My hands 
were up. I cupped my right one 
and gave the heavy man a full 
charge of heat. His hair went up 
in a bright orange flame. He 
dropped the red hot gun from 
his smoking hand, and fell to the 
floor. He frantically rolled around 
the aisle trying to put out his 
flaming clothes. 

One of the other men shot at 
me. The little piece of lead came 
toward me, flew over my shoulder. 
It was going at about 900 feet 
per second. This was enough to 
kill me, Excellency. I became 



panic-stricken. I fled into the I 
wings. I was followed by a storm 
of little whistling lead pellets. 

The stagehands scattered hys- j 
terically before me as I ran down i 
the steps and out the stage door 
entrance. The street in front of 
the theatre was packed with police 
cruisers and athletic-looking men [ 
in blue uniforms. 

Before anyone saw me, I cupped I 
my hand, and fired the gas tank 
of the nearest police cruiser. The | 
ray of the male principle went j 
out with the heat ray. As I 
ran by the flaming car, all of the j 
women in the street felt some- 
thing important. They all turned 
and looked at me. 

Policemen started shooting. 
They piled out of their cars. 
The street was echoing with yells 
and shouts. I was terrified. I 
exerted an enormous effort of 
will and mustered every atom 
of energy at my command. I 
sent a full-power heat blast up 
the street. I have never mar- 
shalled a bigger blast, even in 
the contests at our training school 
in Area Twelve. 

Fifteen automobiles burst into 
flames. Twenty or thirty men and 
women fell screaming to the side- 
walk, their clothes burning. A 
flock of roasted pigeons fell smok- 
ing out of the sky. A black cloud 
condensed over the street, and 
a forked tongue of lightning 
flashed from it. Every woman 



32 



 



within a quarter of a mile felt 
the hot electrical force of the 
male principle. I dived into the 
Times Square subway entrance 
and sprinted down the stairs. 
There was a men's washroom at 
the end of the platform. 

I heard the wild tumult of 
pursuit behind me. I pushed open 
the door. A man was there wash- 
ing his hands. I strangled him, 
tore off his clothes, and put them 
on myself. Hastily, I twisted my 
face about so that I looked like 
an entirely different person. I 
opened the door and started walk- 
ing slowly back down the plat- 
form. 

A platoon of policemen with 
drawn guns was sprinting down 
the platform towards me. They 
were followed by a yelling mob 
of civilians which included hun- 
dreds of women. They swept by 
me. I was safe, but shivering 
with fear, Excellency. I was spent. 
I couldn't have mustered up a 
heat ray strong enough to warm 
the end of my nose. 

I stumbled around the corner 
and away from that neighbor- 
hood. Then I went into the first 
restaurant I saw, and gorged. 
After a five dollar plank steak, 
three glasses of milk, one glass 
of beer, and apple pie a la mode 
I was still ravenous; still energy- 
minus. 

I went a block up the street, 
into another restaurant, and 
bolted down exactly the same 



meal again. Strength started to 
flow slowly through my veins. 
After one more meal in still 
another restaurant, my confidence 
returned. 

The newspapers handled the 
affair with amazing restraint. The 
facts brought in by their reporters 
naturally sounded fantastic to 
the editors, so they rearranged 
them to "make sense." The reti- 
cence of the authorities, par- 
ticularly the F.B.I., helped to 
convert what might have caused 
a national panic into just an 
unusually spectacular chase after 
an escaped murderer. The burn- 
ing cars were laid to hooliganism 
on the part of the bystanders. 
The people who got burned, so 
the stories explained, were hurt 
by the gasoline explosions of 
the burning cars. The mass hys- 
teria of the women was caused 
by the excitement. The papers 
said that the steel necktie worn 
by my stooge at the theatre had 
to be cut off by a water-cooled 
electric saw. They said that how- 
ever I did it, it was a clever trick. 

The next few days, Your Ex- 
cellency, were the most difficult 
of my stay here. I knew that the 
full power of not only the F.B.I., 
but of the whole national govern- 
ment, would be concentrated to 
destroy me. I had to hide — hide, 
and get a new start. 

The money in the pockets of 
my borrowed suit didn't last long. 
I couldn't possibly risk presenting 



THE DOUBLE SPY 



33 



myself as a strong man or a 
magician again. I became a ditch 
digger and a day laborer, and 
finally drifted into the professional 
wrestling racket. Many of the 
top wrestling promoters live in 
Washington, D. C. I rented a 
little white clapboard house with 
green shutters, out in the country 
beyond Silver Springs, Maryland. 

I was careful to keep myself 
a second-rate wrestler. This was 
exasperating, Your Excellency. 
At any time I could have beaten 
three or four of their best wrestlers 
simultaneously. Everything was 
fixed so I won and lost when they 
told me to. We even practiced 
how we were going to win or 
lose before each match. I was very 
obedient and very scared. 

I did everything not to attract 
attention. I started to use the 
male principle again, but so spar- 
ingly that everything looked nat- 
ural. 

I tried to fit into the life of the 
community and become an Ameri- 
can. I joined a Bowling League. 
I learned to play a game called 
"Canasta." 

I got to be great friends with 
a man named Nat Brown, an 
automobile mechanic. He lived 
with his extraordinarily beautiful 
wife, Helene, in a house about 
a half mile away. 

The Browns used to ask me to 
dinner, and I would meet their 
friends. I grew very fond of them. 



We would sit around and drink 
beer and play cards and talk 
until late at night about politics 
and philosophy and love and 
everything else on earth. It was 
by far the swiftest part of my 
education in America, living with 
these lighthearted, charming peo- 
ple who obviously liked me. 

The only disadvantage was the 
problem raised by my increasing 
fondness for Helene Brown. She 
was a vivid incarnation of the 
female principle, and yet I knew 
I must not touch her. I had a 
constant battle with myself to 
maintain the disinterested rela- 
tionship necessary to continuing 
with these people without com- 
plication. 

Both Nat and Helene Brown 
used to come to see me wrestle 
whenever I had a match in Wash- 
ington. Whether I won or lost 
we would go out and drink beer 
together. I would sometimes bring 
another girl along. More and more 
I started to feel like a real 
native American. A couple of 
close friends, Excellency, did a 
lot for your humble servant. 

Three days ago I was riding 
along Connecticut Avenue in my 
new car. When I stopped for a 
light, I saw a familiar face in the 
crowd crossing the street. It was 
the tall heavy man, the F.B.I, 
agent who had tracked me down 
and tried to capture me in the 
theatre the night of the big 
battle. I could sense the mass of 



34 



 



metal carried under his left arm. 

He was hurrying along with 
another man. When I saw who 
it was my blood froze in my 
veins. It was my neighbor, Nat 
Brown. He also had a mass of 
metal under his left arm. 

It was clear to me then that, 
in spite of my precautions, the 
F.B.I, had spotted me weeks ago. 
How, I do not know. Nat Brown 
was their surveillance agent. 

I drove home immediately to 
finish this letter and get it off to 
you. I may not be alive tomorrow. 
The launching apparatus is con- 
cealed in a tool shed about a 
half a mile behind the house. I 
am going to put down my recom- 
mendations and get this off im- 
mediately — before it's too late. 

As I see it, Excellency, there 
are only four courses available 
to us: 

(1) A chemical or other isolation 
of the female principle, fol- 
lowed by an attempt to syn- 
thesize it at home to see 
what its effect would be on 
our women. This might save 
us. Unfortunately I have yet 
been able to isolate what 
causes the female principle 
here; so this is not a possibil- 
ity yet. 

(2) Kidnap some of their women. 
This would be delightful fun 
for Your Excellency and a 
few others; but it would 
not solve the main problem. 



Transportation difficulties 
would make it impossible to 
get enough of them. Also, 
if the basic element which 
creates the "female principle" 
is lacking because of some 
soil or other deficiency at 
home, their women would 
soon become like ours. All 
of our trouble would go for 
nothing, and our doom would 
continue to approach. 
(3) Conquer them, kill the men, 
take their women, and live 
with the women here. This, 
in my opinion, should not 
' be attempted for the follow- 
ing reasons. Americans are ex- 
traordinarily efficient in war- 
fare. They have atomic and 
hydrogen weapons, and they 
know how to use them. They 
are very warlike, although 
they constantly deny it. Some 
of their other weapons are 
fully equal to ours, in some 
respects, superior. Our com- 
munications would be far too 
long to enable us to prevail. 
This should be attempted 
only if the fourth alternative 
fails; and even then only after 
long expensive preparation. 
Also, there is distinct danger 
if we disclose ourselves by 
attacking them. They may 
find a way to attack us, and 
cause considerable damage. 
As things are now, with our 
vanishing birth rate, we can't 
afford to lose people in a war. 



THE DOUBLE SPY 



35 



(4) The fourth alternative is to 
breed ' their race out of ex- 
istence by planting our blood 
here — in other words, an 
invasion from within. This 
will depend upon our two 
races being inter-fertile. I am 
almost certain that they are. 
If I can stay alive for seven 
months longer I will give you 
a definite report. I will carry 
on the experiment as swiftly 
as possible. 
Since these people have such 
a short life span our descendants 
will live hundreds of years longer 
than theirs. The present race 
will slowly be bred out due to 
the infirmities of its men. Our 
men and their women will create 
a race superior to both. 

If I can find a way to escape 
from the F.B.I., and establish 
myself once more in safety I will 
try to justify Your Excellency's 
confidence in your humble serv- 
ant. 

I put the letter down on my 
desk. It certainly told most of 
the story. It needed only a final 
paragraph. Then I sat down at the 
typewriter and added it: 

I am closing now, Your Excel- 
lency. Tomorrow will be the 
transmission date for this letter. 
I may not communicate with 
you again for some time, but 
please understand, Excellency, 
that I am your humble and 
devoted servant and have tried 

36 



to carry on in strict accordance 
with your wishes. 

I put the letter into an envelope 
and put it in my pocket. Then I 
got into my car and drove down 
through the city to the northwest 
wing of the Department of Justice 
Building. The elevator girl smiled. 
"Haven't seen you for a long 
time, Nat. Don't you work for 
the F.B.I, any more?" 

I smiled back at her, "The 
Chief has had me up to a lot of 
out-of-town devilment." 

I passed Jack and Tex in the 
hall, and we waved to each other. 
They wanted to talk, but I was 
in too much of a hurry. "The 
Chief wants me," I said, without 
slowing down. 

When I reached the Chief's 
office Mrs. Sperling gave me a 
broad grin. "Hello, Nat. The 
Chief's been waiting for you." 

I went down the little corridor 
into the Chief's room. He was 
sitting at his desk looking grim 
and tense. On the wall behind 
him was a huge map of the 
United States. It had clumps of 
vari-colored pins all over it. His 
deep voice boomed across the 
room. 

"Hello, Nat. How is the Chief 
of the Venusian Desk?" 

"Well, if you want to know 
the truth, Chief, I'm pretty god 
damned relieved. Some jobs are 
fun. But my hair has been stand- 
ing on end so much since you 
gave me this job that it's going 

 



to need about a year's rest. No 
man wants his hair to have a 
nervous breakdown." 

The Chief looked at me fondly. 
"Well, I can't say you carried 
your mission out quietly. It prac- 
tically blew me out of bed, and 
I live at least ten miles away." 

"Joe did a hell of a good job 
with the TNT," I said. "How 
the hell he ever got twenty tons 
of it down in the basement in 
three hours I'll never find out." 

A slight frown came over the 
Chief's face. "Are you sure our 
Venusian friend was there?" 

"Absolutely." 

"How — absolutely?" 

"I called him on the telephone. 
When he answered I pressed the 
button. I heard the explosion 
over the wire, half a second before 
it practically tore down my own 
house. When I got over there a 
big crowd was collecting." I took 
a deep breath. "Not much for 
them to look at, though — just a 
big black smoking hole in the 
ground." 

"And our inter-planetary 
friend?" 

"Well, I don't know about his 
soul, Chief, but his body isn't 
around anywhere. I guess it just 
turned into steam with the rest 
of the house. A lot of women 
are going to be sad as hell." 

I saw the Chief's fists clenched 
on the desk. He was still taut 
from the strain of the last few 
hours. Finalry he reached for the 



silver cigarette box on his desk. 
His fingers jerked crazily as he 
put a cigarette in his mouth. 
He passed the box to me. I took 
one and started fumbling in my 
pockets for a match. The Chief 
snapped open the top of his big 
desk lighter, and held it over to 
me. I put the cigarette into the 
flame and drew deeply. The flame 
was at least three inches high. 
The Chief leaned forward, his 
eyes riveted on me. There was 
a queer, expectant look on his 
face. I stared back at him, puz- 
zled. Finally he snapped the 
lighter shut, and turned to the 
wall. "It's all right, boys," he 
said. 

A door with grillework along 
the front opened up. I saw Joe 
Evans and Tom Hardy and Jim 
Reid standing there with tommy 
guns, pointed right at my head. 

The Chief laughed at my ex- 
pression of bewilderment. 

"I wasn't taking any chances, 
Nat. You can't afford to in a situa- 
tion like this. No matter how 
sure you are, you can't gamble 
the whole future of your own 
world. I wanted to be damned 
certain that you really were Nat 
Brown, and not His Excellency's 
humble servant from the planet 
Venus. If you had flinched so 
much as one eyelash, Nat, when 
I held that lighter up to your 
face, three tommy guns would 
have opened up on you — all at 



THE DOUBLE SPY 



37 



one and the same time." 

I felt suddenly limp. I uttered 
a long audible whistle of relief. 

The Chief's voice was low and 
solemn. "Think what we've es- 
caped, Nat — think how close he 
came to getting loose on our 
world!" 

I took the letter out and threw 
it on his desk. "After you read 
this, Chief, you'll appreciate it a 
little more. The last paragraph is 
mine. I picked up the letter while 
the boys were loading the TNT 
down in the basement." 

While the Chief was reading 
the letter I got up and looked 
at the map of the United States 
behind him. Each of the colored 
pinheads had names printed on 
them. Grouped around Silver 
Springs, Maryland, were two pins. 
One was labeled "Chief." The 
other was labeled "Nat Brown." 
I turned to the Chief. "I wish 
you would do one thing for me." 

"I'll do anything for you." 

"Instead of calling us 'Chief 
and 'Nat Brown,' call us 'Excel- 
lency' and 'Your Humble Serv- 
ant.'" 

The Chief chuckled. "There 
has never been any humor on 
that board, and by God, it's 
high time there was." He rang 
the buzzer. "Mrs. Sperling, 
change the 'Chief and 'Nat 
Brown' pins to 'Excellency' and 
'Your Humble Servant.' " 

Her eyes widened a bit, but 



the labels were changed on the 
spot. 

When the Chief got to that 
part about the recommendations 
he read them out loud. Then he 
began to pace the room. 

"Nat," he said, "I'm going 
to see that you get some very 
special recognition for the job 
you have done. 1 mean recogni- 
tion from the White House itself. 
Of course we can't give it any 
publicity — at least not yet — 
but it will mean a lot more money 
for you." 

"Thanks, Chief, I can use it." 
"In your opinion, what should 
we do now, as our next step?" 
He paused. "Or should we just do 
nothing?" 

" I think we've got to be careful 
that they don't send anyone else 
down here. Or maybe it is 'up' 
here. We've got to get messages 
back to his 'Excellency' every 
once in a while from 'Your Hum- 
ble Servant.' 1 know how to do 
it now. The launching tube is 
still intact in its shed. There 
are ten rockets, so we can send 
at least ten messages. Time plays 
in our favor — since they have 
apparently lost the ability to 
reproduce themselves, they are 
dying out. If we can hold them 
off for a long enough period, 
we'll be safe forever. The most 
important thing, Chief, is to be 
sure we know it if they land any 
more 'humble servants' on the 
earth."

The Chief nodded approval. 
"How can we make sure we'll 
know it?" 

"It's hard to make absolutely 
sure, but why not send me out 
on a roving mission to set up an 
international organization to de- 
tect such a creature? What we 
want is information about any- 
one, anywhere, who is unusually 
strong or unusually attractive to 
women, or eats six or eights meals 
a day, or who has the other 
queer powers they have. I could 
get all the information coming 
in from all over the world, process 
it here, and only bother you when 
we found something suspicious." 

The Chief was enthusiastic. 
"You've thought yourself up a 
job, Nat. Take three weeks vaca- 
tion to get yourself rested up, 
and then get started." 

I walked down the long marble 
corridors away from the Chief's 
office, and went down in the 
elevator and out into the street. 
As I walked along in the crowds 
I felt the warmth of bodies as 
they passed me. I suddenly real- 
ized the novacaine was beginning 
to wear off. I didn't get out any 
too soon. My chin ached and 
throbbed. That hot searing flame 
had come so close . . . from now 
on my nightmares would be of 
that moment when the Chief 
was holding the lighter to my 
cigarette. But one thing sang 
through my being; the battle 



was won. In a month my world 
travels for the F.B.I, would start. 

Like a phoenix, I, the new Nat 
Brown, had risen re-born from 
the ashes of the Nat Brown 
vaporized by the explosion. What 
could his thoughts have been, 
lying tied up on the living room 
floor waiting for twenty tons of 
TNT to go off? Waiting, while 
I held the mirror in front of me 
and slowly made my face into an 
exact replica of his. He must 
have known then that I would 
get his job, and get his wife, 
Helene, and finally get his world. 
He realized then that His Excel- 
lency would send down hundreds 
more like me and that I would 
be the screen between them and 
the F.B.I., that I would instruct 
them and encourage them and 
give them aid and safety for their 
missions. 

As I neared the Cathedral I 
looked west on Massachusetts 
Avenue. The sun had just set 
and the Evening Star was hang- 
ing like a lantern in the sky — my 
homeland, the radiant planet 
which men on earth call Venus. 
Venus, they have told me, means 
love. What a superb and cosmic 
joke that is! I looked at the 
beautiful orb on the horizon and 
was filled with the triumphant 
excitement of being the earth- 
man, Nat Brown, of going home 
to my wife, Helene, one of the 
thousands who would breed thou- 
sands who would breed thousands. 



THE DOUBLE SPY

RING ONCE 
FOR DEATH 




BY ROBERT ARTHUR 

The power of the old gods was certainly nothing for Mark 
and Edith — a modern, twentieth-century couple — to 
worry about. After all — everybody dies! 



Twenty years had left no trace 
inside Sam Kee's little shop on 
Mott Street. There were the same 
dusty jars of ginseng root and 
tigers' whiskers, the same little 
bronze Buddahs, the same gim- 
cracks mixed with fine jade. Edith 
Williams gave a little murmur of 
pleasure as the door shut behind 
them. 

"Mark," she said, "it hasn't 
changed! It doesn't look as if a 
thing had been sold since we were 

40 



here on our honeymoon." 

"It certainly doesn't," Dr. 
Mark Williams agreed, moving 
down the narrow aisle behind her. 
"If someone hadn't told us Sam 
Kee was dead, I'd believe we'd 
stepped back twenty years in 
time, like they do in those scien- 
tific stories young David reads." 

"We must buy something," his 
wife said. "For a twentieth anni- 
versary present for me. Perhaps a 
bell?"

From the shadowy depths of 
the shop a young man emerged, 
American in dress and manner de- 
spite the Oriental contours of his 
face and eyes. 

1 ' Good evening, ' ' he said . " May 
I show you something?" 

"We think we want a bell," Dr. 
Williams chuckled. "But we aren't 
quite sure. You're Sam Kee's 
son?" 

"Sam Kee, junior. My honored 
father passed to the halls of his 
ancestors five years ago. I could 
just say that he died — " black 
eyes twinkled — "but customers 
like the more flowery mode of 
speech. They think it's quaint." 

"I think it's just nice, and not 
quaint at all," Edith Williams de- 
clared. "We're sorry your father 
is dead. We'd hoped to see him 
again. Twenty years ago when 
we were a very broke young 
couple on a honeymoon he sold 
us a wonderful rose-crystal neck- 
lace for half price." 

"I'm sure he still made a 
profit." The black eyes twinkled 
again. "But if you'd like a bell, 
here are small temple bells, camel 
bells, dinner bells. ..." 

But even as he spoke, Edith 
Williams' hand darted to some- 
thing at the back of the shelf. 

"A bell carved out of crystal! " 
she exclaimed. "And rose-crystal 
at that. What could be more per- 
fect? A rose-crystal wedding pres- 
ent and a rose-crystal anniversary 
present!" 

42 



The young man half stretched 
out his hand. 

"I don't think you want that," 
he said. "It's broken." 

"Broken?" Edith Williams 
rubbed off the dust and held the 
lovely bell-shape of crystal, the 
size of a pear, to the light. "It 
looks perfect to me." 

"I mean it is not complete." 
Something of the American had 
vanished from the young man. 
"It has no clapper. It will not 
ring." 

"Why, that's right." Mark 
Williams took the bell. "The clap- 
per's missing." 

"We can have another clapper 
made," his wife declared. "That 
is, if the original can't be found? " 

The young Chinese shook his 
head. 

"The bell and the clapper were 
deliberately separated by my fa- 
ther twenty years ago." He hesi- 
tated, then added: "My father 
was afraid of this bell." 

"Afraid of it?" Mark Williams 
raised his eyebrows. 

The other hesitated again. 

"It will probably sound like a 
story for tourists," he said. "But 
my father believed it. This bell 
was supposedly stolen from the 
temple of a sect of Buddhists 
somewhere in the mountains of 
China's interior. Just as many 
Occidentals believe that the Chris- 
tian Judgement Day will be her- 
alded by a blast on St. Peter's 
trumpet, so this small sect is said 

 



to believe that when a bell like 
this one is rung, a bell carved 
from a single piece of rose crystal, 
and consecrated by ceremonies 
lasting ten years, any dead within 
sound of it will rise and live 
again." 

"Heavenly!" Edith Williams 
cried. "And no pun intended. 
Mark, think what a help this bell 
will be in your practise when we 
make it ring again!" To the 
Chinese she added, smiling: "I'm 
just teasing him. My husband is 
really a very fine surgeon." 

The other bqwed his head. 

"I must tell you," he said, 
"you will not be able to make it 
ring. Only the original clapper, 
carved from the same block of rose 
crystal, will ring it. That is why 
my father separated them." 

Again he hesitated. 

"I have told you only half of 
what my father told me. He said 
that, though it defeats death, 
Death can not be defeated. Robbed 
of his chosen victim, he takes an- 
other in his place. Thus when the 
bell was used in the temple of its 
origin — let us say when a high 
priest or a chief had died — a 
slave or servant was placed handy 
for Death to take when he had 
been forced to relinquish his grasp 
upon the important one." 

He smiled, shook his head. 

"There," he said. "A prepos- 
terous story. Now if you wish it, 
the bell is ten dollars. Plus, of 
course, sales tax." 



"The story alone is worth 
more," Dr. Williams declared. "I 
think we'd better have it sent, 
hadn't we, Edith? It'll be safer in 
the mail than in our suitcase." 

"Sent?" His wife seemed to 
come out of some deep feminine 
meditation. "Oh, of course. And 
as for its not ringing — I shall 
make it ring. I know I shall." 

"If the story is true," Mark 
Williams murmured, "I hope 
not. ..." 

The package came on a Satur- 
day morning, when Mark Wil- 
liams was catching up on the lat- 
est medical publications in his 
untidy, book-lined study. He heard 
Edith unwrapping paper in the 
hall outside. Then she came in 
with the rose-crystal bell in her 
hands. 

"Mark, it's here!" she said. 
"Now to make it ring'." 

She plumped herself down be- 
side his desk. He took the bell and 
reached for a silver pencil. 

"Just for the sake of curiosity," 
he remarked, "and not because I 
believe that delightful sales talk 
we were given, let's see if it will 
ring when I tap. It should, you 
know." 

He tapped the lip of the bell. A 
muted thunk was the only re- 
sponse. Then he tried with a coin, 
a paper knife, and the bottom of a 
glass. In each instance the result- 
ing sound was nothing like a bell 
ringing. 



RING ONCE FOR DEATH 



43 



"If you've finished, Mark," 
Edith said then, with feminine 
tolerance, "let me show you how 
it's done." 

"Gladly," her husband agreed. 
She took the bell and turned 
away for a moment. Then she 
shook the bell vigorously. A clear, 
sweet ringing shivered through 
the room — so thin and etherial 
that small involuntary shivers 
crawled up his spine. 

"Good Lord!" he exclaimed. 
"How did you do that?" 

"I just put the clapper back in 
place with some thread," Edith 
told him. 

"The clapper?" He struck his 
forehead with his palm. "Don't 
tell me — the crystal necklace we 
bought twenty years ago!" 

"Of course." Her tone was com- 
posed. "As soon as young Sam 
Kee told us about his father's 
separating the clapper and the 
bell, I remembered the central 
crystal pendant on my necklace. 
It is shaped like a bell clapper — 
we mentioned it once. 

"I guessed right away we had 
the missing clapper. But I didn't 
say so. I wanted to score on you, 
Mark — " she smiled affection- 
ately at him — "and because, 
you know, I had a queer feeling 
Sam Kee, junior, wouldn't let us 
have the bell if he guessed we had 
the clapper." 

"I don't think he would." 
Mark Williams picked up his pipe 
and rubbed the bowl with his 



thumb. "Yet he didn't really be- 
lieve that story he told us any 
more than we do." 

"No, but his father did. And if 
old Sam Kee had told it to us — 
remember how wrinkled and wise 
he seemed? — I do believe we'd 
have believed the story." 

"You're probably right." Dr. 
Williams rang the bell and waited. 
The thin, sweet sound seemed to 
hang in the air a long moment, 
then was gone. 

"Nope," he said. "Nothing 
happened. Although, of course, 
that may be because there was no 
deceased around to respond." 

"I'm not sure I feel like joking 
about the story." A small frown 
gathered on Edith's forehead. "I 
had planned to use the bell as a 
dinner bell and to tell the story 
to our guests. But now — I'm not 
sure." 

Frowning, she stared at the bell 
until the ringing of the telephone 
in the hall brought her out of her 
abstraction. 

"Sit still, I'll answer." She hur- 
ried out. Dr. Williams, turning the 
rose crystal bell over in his hand, 
could hear the sudden tension in 
her voice as she answered. He was 
on his feet when she reentered. 

"An emergency operation at 
the hospital," she sighed. "Nice 
young man — automobile acci- 
dent. Fracture of the skull, Dr. 
Amos says. He wouldn't have dis- 
turbed you but you're the only 
brain man in town, with Dr. 



44 



 



Hendryx away on vacation." 

"I know." He was already in 
the hall, reaching for his hat. 
"Man's work is from sun to sun, 
but a doctor's work is never done," 
he misquoted. 

"I'll drive you." Edith followed 
him out. "You sit back and relax 
for another ten minutes. ..." 

Two hours later, as they drove 
homeward, the traffic was light, 
which was fortunate. More than 
once Mark, in a frowning abstrac- 
tion, found himself on the left of 
the center line and had to pull 
back into his own lane. 

He had lost patients before, but 
never without a feeling of personal 
defeat. Edith said he put too much 
of himself into every operation. 
Perhaps he did. And yet — No, 
there was every reason why the 
young man should have lived. 
Yet, just as Mark Williams had 
felt that he had been successful, 
the patient had died. 

In twenty years of marriage, 
Edith Williams had learned to 
read his thoughts at times. Now 
she put a hand comfortingly on 
his arm. 

"These things happen, dar- 
ling," she szfid. "You know that. 
A doctor can only do so much. 
Some of the job always remains in 
the hands of Nature. And she 
does play tricks at times." 

"Yes, confound it, I know it," 
her husband growled. "But I 
resent losing that lad. There was 

RING ONCE FOR DEATH 



no valid reason for it — unless 
there was some complication I 
overlooked." He shook his head, 
scowling. "I ordered an autopsy 
but — Yes, I'm going to do that 
autopsy myself. I'm going to turn 
back and do it now. I have to 
know!" 

He pulled abruptly to the left 
to swing into a side road and 
turn. Edith Williams never saw 
the car that hit them. She heard 
the frantic blare of a horn and a 
scream of brakes, and in a frozen 
instant realized that there had 
been someone behind them, about 
to pass. Then the impact came, 
throwing her forward into the 
windshield and unconsciousness. 

Edith Williams opened her eyes. 
Even before she realized that she 
was lying on the ground and that 
the figure bending over her was a 
State Trooper, she remembered 
the crash. Her head hurt but 
there was no confusion in her 
mind. Automatically, even as she 
tried to sit up, she accepted the 
fact that there had been a crash, 
help had come, and she must have 
been unconscious for several min- 
utes at least. 

"Hey, lady, take it easy!" the 
Trooper protested. "You had a 
bad bump. You got to lie still until 
the ambulance gets here. It'll be 
along in five minutes." 

"Mark," Edith said, paying no 
attention. "My husband! Is he 
all right?" 

45 



"Now lady, please. He's being 
taken care of. You — " 

But she was not listening. Hold- 
ing to his arm she pulled herself 
to a sitting position. She saw their 
car on its side some yards away, 
other cars pulled up around them, 
a little knot of staring people. Saw 
them and dismissed them. Her 
gaze found her husband, lying on 
the ground a few feet away, a coat 
folded beneath his head. 

Mark was dead. She had been a 
doctor's wife for twenty years, 
and before that a nurse. She knew 
death when she saw it. 

"Mark." The word was spoken 
to herself, but the Trooper took it 
for a question. 

"Yes, lady," he said. "He's 
dead. He was still breathing when 
I got here, but he died two, three 
minutes ago." 

She got to her knees. Her only 
thought was to reach his side. She 
scrambled across the few feet of 
ground to him still on her knees 
and crouched beside him, fum- 
bling for his pulse. There was 
none. There was nothing. Just a 
man who had been alive and now 
was dead. 

Behind her she heard a voice 
raised. She turned. A large, di- 
sheveled man was standing beside 
the Trooper, talking loudly. 

"Now listen, officer," he was 
saying, "I'm telling you again, it 
wasn't my fault. The guy pulled 
sharp left right in front of me. Not 
a thing I could do. It's a wonder 



we weren't all three of us killed. 
You can see by the marks on their 
car it wasn't my fault — " 

Edith Williams closed her mind 
to the voice. She let Mark's hand 
lie in her lap as she fumbled in 
her bag, which was somehow still 
clutched in her fingers. She groped 
for a handkerchief to stem the 
tears which would not be held 
back. Something was in the way 
— something smooth and hard 
and cold. She drew it out and 
heard the thin, sweet tinkle of the 
crystal bell. She must have dropped 
it automatically into her bag as 
they were preparing to leave the 
house. 

The hand in her lap moved. She 
gasped and bent forward as her 
husband's eyes opened. 

" M ark ! " she whispered . " M ark , 
darling!" 

"Edith," Mark Williams said 
with an effort. "Sorry — damned 
careless of me. Thinking of the 
hospital ..." 

' ' You're alive ! "she said." You're 
alive! Oh, darling, darling, lie still, 
the ambulance will be here any 
second." 

"Ambulance?" he protested. 
"I'm all right now. Help me — 
sit up." 

"But Mark " 

"Just a bump on the head." 
He struggled to sit up. The State 
Trooper came over. 

"Easy, buddy, easy," he said, 
his voice awed. "We thought you 
were gone. Now let's not lose you a 



46 



 



second time." His mouth was tight. 

"Hey, I'm sure glad you're all 
right!" the red-faced man said in 
a rush of words. "Whew, fellow, 
you had me all upset, even though 
it wasn't my fault. I mean, how's 
a guy gonna keep from hitting 
you when — when " 

"Catch him!" Mark Williams 
cried, but the Trooper was too 
late. The other man plunged for- 
ward to the ground and lay where 
he had fallen without quivering. 

The clock in the hall struck two 
with muted . strokes. Cautiously 
Edith Williams rose on her elbow 
and looked down at her husband's 
face. His eyes opened and looked 
back at her. 

"You're awake," she said, un- 
necessarily. 

" I woke up a few minutes ago," 
he answered. "I've been lying 
here — thinking." 

"I'll get you another pheno- 
barbital. Dr. Amos said for you to 
take them and sleep until to- 
morrow." 

"I know. I'll take one presently. 
You know — hearing that clock 
just now reminded me of some- 
thing." 

"Yes?" 

"Just before I came to this 
afternoon, after the crash, I had a 
strange impression of hearing a 
bell ring. It sounded so loud in my 
ears I opened my eyes to see where 
it was." 

"A — bell?" 

RING ONCE FOR DEATH 



"Yes. Just auditory hallucina- 
tion, of course." 
"But Mark — " 
"Yes?" 

"A — a bell did ring. I mean, I 
had the crystal bell in my bag and 
it tinkled a little. Do you sup- 
pose — " 

"Of course not." But though he 
spoke swiftly he did not sound 
convincing. "This was a loud bell. 
Like a great gong." 

"But — I mean, Mark darling 
— a moment earlier you — had 
no pulse." 

"No pulse?" 

"And you weren't — breath- 
ing. Then the crystal bell tinkled 
and you — you . . ." 

"Nonsense! I know what you're 
thinking and believe me — it's 
nonsense! " 

"But Mark." She spoke care- 
fully. "The driver of the other car. 
You had no sooner regained con- 
sciousness than he — " 

"He had a fractured skull!" 
Dr. Williams interrupted sharply. 
"The ambulance intern diagnosed 
it. Skull fractures often fail to 
show themselves and then — 
bingo, you keel over. That's what 
happened. Now let's say no more 
about it." 

"Of course." In the hall, the 
clock struck the quarter hour. 
"Shall I fix the phenobarbital 
now? " 

"Yes — no. Is David home?" 
She hesitated. "No, he hasn't 
got back yet." 

47 



"Has he phoned? He knows 
he's supposed to be in by midnight 
at the latest." 

"No, he — hasn't phoned. But 
there's a school dance tonight." 

"That's no excuse for not phon- 
ing. He has the old car, hasn't 
he?" 

"Yes. You gave him the keys 
this morning, remember? " 

"All the more reason he should 
phone." Dr. Williams lay silent a 
moment. "Two o'clock is too late 
for a 17-year-old boy to be out." 

"I'll speak to him. He won't do 
it again. Now please, Mark, let 
me get you the phenobarbital. I'll 
stay up until David — " 

The ringing phone, a clamor in 
the darkness, interrupted her. 
Mark Williams reached for it. The 
extension was beside his bed. 

"Hello," he said. And then, al- 
though she could not hear the 
answering voice, she felt him 
stiffen. And she knew. As well as 
if she could hear the words she 
knew, with a mother's instinct for 
ciis3.stcr» 

"Yes," Dr. Williams said. "Yes 
... I see ... I understand . . . 
I'll come at once . . . Thank you 
for calling." 

He slid out of bed before she 
could stop him. 

"An emergency call." He spoke 
quietly. "I have to go." He began 
to throw on his clothes. 

"It's David," she said. "Isn't 
it?" She sat up. "Don't try to 



keep me from knowing. It's about 
David." 

"Yes," he said. His voice was 
very tired. "David is hurt. I have 
to go to him. An accident." 

"He's dead." She said it stead- 
ily. "David's dead, isn't he, 
Mark?" 

He came over and sat beside 
her and put his arms around her. 

"Edith," he said. "Edith — 
Yes, he's dead. Forty minutes ago. 
The car — went over a curve. 
They have him — at the County 
morgue. They want me to — 
identify him. Identify him. Edith! 
You see, the car caught fire!" 

"I'm coming with you," she 
said. "I'm coming with you!" 

The taxi waited in a pool of 
darkness between two street lights. 
The long, low building which was 
the County morgue, a blue lamp 
over its door, stood below the 
street level. A flight of concrete 
steps went down to it from the 
sidewalk. Ten minutes before, Dr. 
Mark Williams had gone down 
those steps. Now he climbed back 
up them, stiffly, wearily, like an 
old man. 

Edith was waiting in the taxi, 
sitting forward on the edge of the 
seat, hands clenched. As he reached 
the last step she opened the door 
and stepped out. 

"Mark," she asked shakily, 
"was it — " 

"Yes, it's David." His voice 
was a monotone. "Our son. I've 



48 



 



completed the formalities. For 
now the only thing we can do is 
go home." 

"I'm going to him!" She tried 
to pass. He caught her wrist. Dis- 
cretely the taxi driver pretended 
to doze. 

"No, Edith! There's no need. 
You mustn't — see him ! " 

"He's my son!" she cried. 
"Let me go!" 

"No!" What have you got 
under your coat?" 

"It's the bell, the rose-crystal 
bell!" she cried. "I'm going to 
ring it where David can hear!" 

Defiantly she brought forth her 
hand, clutching the little bell. "It 
brought you back, Mark! Now it's 
going to bring back David!" 

"Edith!" he said in horror. 
"You mustn't believe that's possi- 
ble. You can't. Those were coinci- 
dences. Now let me have it." 

"No! I'm going to ring it." 
Violently she tried to break out of 
his grip. "I want David back! 
I'm going to ring the bell!" 

She got her hand free. The 
crystal bell rang in the quiet of the 
early morning with an eerie thin- 
ness, penetrating the silence like a 
silver knife. 

' ' There !" Edith Williams panted . 
"I've rung it. I know you don't 
believe, but I do. It'll bring David 
back." She raised her voice. 
"David!" she called. "David, 
son! Can you hear me?" 

"Edith,". Dr. Williams groaned. 
"You're just tormenting yourself. 

\ 

RING ONCE FOR DEATH 



Come home. Please come home." 

"Not until David has come 
back . . . David, David, can you 
hear me? " She rang the bell again, 
rang it until Dr. Williams seized 
it, then she let him take it. 
( "Edith, Edith," he groaned. 
"If only you had let me come 
alone ..." 

"Mark, listen!" 

"What?" 

"Listen!" she whispered with 
fierce urgency. 

He was silent. And then fingers 
of horror drew themselves down 
his spine at the clear, youthful 
voice that came up to them from 
the darkness below. 

"Mother? . . . Dad? . . . 
Where are you? " 

"David!" Edith Williams 
breathed. "It's David! Let me 




"Lately I've been feel- 
ing only half there — " 

49 



go! I must go to him." 

"No, Edith!" her husband whis- 
pered frantically, as the voice be- 
low called again. 

"Dad? . . . Mother? ... Are 
you up there? Wait for me." 

"Let me go!" she sobbed. 
"David, we're here! We're up 
here, son!" 

"Edith ! " Mark Williams gasped. 
" If you've ever loved me, listen 
to me. You mustn't go down 
there. David — I had to identify 
him by his class ring and his 
wallet. He was burned — terribly 
burned!" 

"I'm going to him!" She 
wrenched herself free and sped 
for the steps, up which now was 
coming a tall form, a shadow 
shrouded in the darkness. 

Dr. Williams, horror knotting 
his stomach, leaped to stop her. 
But he slipped and fell headlong 
on the pavement, so that she was 
able to pant down the stairs to 
meet the upcoming figure. 

"Oh, David," she sobbed, 
"David!" 

"Hey, Mom!" The boy held 
her steady. "I'm sorry. I'm terri- 
bly sorry. But I didn't know what 
had happened until I got home 
and you weren't there and then 
one of the fellows from the fra- 
ternity called me. I realized they 
must have made a mistake, and 
you'd come here, and I called for 
a taxi and came out here. My taxi 
let me off at the entrance around 
the block, and I've been looking 



for you down there . . . Poor 
Pete!" 

"Pete?" she asked. 

"Pete Friedburg. He was driv- 
ing the old car. I lent him the keys 
and my driver's license. I shouldn't 
have — but he's older and he kept 
begging me. ..." 

"Then — then it's Pete who 
was killed?" she gasped. "Pete 
who was — burned? " 

"Yes, Pete. I feel terrible about 
lending him the car. But he was 
supposed to be a good driver. And 
then them calling you, you and 
Dad thinking it was me — " 

"Then Mark was right. Of 
course he was right." She was 
laughing and sobbing now. "It's 
just a bell, a pretty little bell, 
that's all." 

"Bell? I don't follow you, 
Mom." 

"Never mind," Edith Williams 
gasped. "It's just a bell. It hasn't 
any powers over life and death. 
It doesn't bring back and it 
doesn't take away. But let's get 
back up to your father. He may be 
thinking that the bell — that the 
bell really worked." 

They climbed the rest of the 
steps. Dr. Mark Williams still 
lay where he had fallen headlong 
on the pavement. The cab driver 
was bending over him, but there 
was nothing to be done. The 
crystal bell had been beneath him 
when he fell, and it had broken. 
One long, fine splinter of crystal 
was embedded in his heart.

THE 

DRAW 




Joe doolin's my name. Cowhand 
— work for old Farrel over at 
Lazy F beyond the Pass. Never 
had much of anything exciting 
happen to me — just punched 
cows and lit up on payday — 
until the day I happened to ride 
through the Pass on my way to 
town and saw young Buck Tar- 
rant's draw. 

Now, Buck'd always been a 
damn good shot. Once he got 
his gun in his hand he could 
put a bullet right where he 
wanted it up to twenty paces, 
and within an inch of his aim up 
to a hundred feet. But Lord God, 
he couldn't draw to save his life — 
I'd seen him a couple of times 
before in the Pass, trying to. 
He'd face a tree and go into a 
crouch, and' I'd know he was 
pretending the tree was Billy 



BY JEROME BIXBY 



Stories of the old West were filled 
with bad men who lived by the speed 
of their gun hand. Well, meet Buck 
Tarrant, who could outdraw them 
all. His secret: he didn't even have 
to reach for his weapon. . . . 



the Kid or somebody, and then 
he'd slap leather — and his clumsy 
hand would wallop his gunbutt, 
he'd yank like hell, his old Peace- 
maker would come staggering out 
of his holster like a bear in heat, 
and finally he'd line on his target 
and plug it dead center. But the 
whole business took about a sec- 
ond and a half, and by the time 
he'd ever finished his fumbling 
in a real fight, Billy the Kid 
or Sheriff Ben Randolph over in 
town or even me, Joe Doolin, 
could have cut him in half. 

So this time, when I was riding 
along through the Pass, I saw 
Buck upslope from me under 
the trees, and I just grinned and 
didn't pay too much attention. 

He stood facing an old elm 
tree, and I could see he'd tacked 
a playing card about four feet 



51 



up the trunk, about where a 
man's heart would be. 

Out of the corner of my eye 
I saw him go into his gunman's 
crouch. He was about sixty feet 
away from me, and, like I said, 
I wasn't paying much mind to 
him. 

I heard the shot, flat down the 
rocky slope that separated us. 
I grinned again, picturing that 
fumbly draw of his, the wild slap 
at leather, the gun coming out 
drunklike, maybe even him drop- 
ping it — I'd seen him do that 
once or twice. 

It got me to thinking about 
him, as I rode closer. 

He was a bad one. Nobody said 
any different than that. Just bad. 
He was a bony runt of about 
eighteen, with bulging eyes and 
a wide mouth that was always 
turned down at the corners. He 
got his nickname Buck because 
he had buck teeth, not because 
he was heap man. He was some 
handy with his fists, and he liked 
to pick ruckuses with kids he 
was sure he could lick. But the 
tipoff on Buck is that he'd blat 
like a two-day calf to get out of 
mixing with somebody he was 
scared of — which meant some- 
body his own size or bigger. He'd 
jaw his way out of it, or just turn 
and slink away with his tail 
along his belly. His dad had died 
a couple years before, and he 
lived with his ma on a small 



ranch out near the Pass. The 
place was falling to pieces, be- 
cause Buck wouldn't lift a hand 
to do any work around — his ma 
just couldn't handle him at all. 
Fences were down, and the yard 
was all weedgrown, and the house 
needed some repairs — but all 
Buck ever did was hang around 
town, trying to rub up against 
some of the tough customers who 
drank in the Once Again Saloon, 
or else he'd ride up and lie around 
under the trees along the top 
of the Pass and just think — or, 
like he was today, he'd practise 
drawing and throwing down on 
trees and rocks. 

Guess he always wanted to 
be tough. Really tough. He tried 
to walk with tough men, and, 
as we found out later, just about' 
all he ever thought about while 
he was lying around was how he 
could be tougher than the next 
two guys. Maybe you've known 
characters like that — for gome 
damfool reason they just got to 
be able to whup anybody who 
comes along, and they feel low 
and mean when they can't, as 
if the size of a man's fist was the 
size of the man. 

So that's Buck Tarrant — a 
halfsized, poisonous, no-good kid 
who wanted to be a hardcase. 

But he'd never be, not in a 
million years. That's what made 
it funny — and kind of pitiful 
too. There wasn't no real strength 
in him, only a scared hate. It 



52 



takes guts as well as speed to be 
tough with a gun, and Buck was 
just a nasty little rat of a kid 
who'd probably always counter- 
punch his way through life when 
he punched at all. He'd kite for 
cover if you lifted a lip. 

1 heard another shot, and 
looked up the slope. I was near 
enough now to see that the card 
he was shooting at was a ten of 
diamonds — and that he was 
plugging the pips one by one. 
Always could shoot, like I said. 

Then he heard me coming, 
and whirled away from the tree, 
his gun holstered, his hand held 
out in front of him like he must 
have imagined Hickock or some- 
body held it when he was ready to 
draw. 

I stopped my horse about ten 
feet away and just stared at 
him. He looked real funny in his 
baggy old levis and dirty check- 
ered shirt and that big gun low 
on his hip, and me knowing he 
couldn't handle it worth a damn. 

"Who you trying to scare, 
Buck?" I said. I looked him up 
and down and snickered. "You 
look about as dangerous as a 
sheepherder's wife." 

"And you're a son of a bitch," 
he said. 

I stiffened and shoved out my 
jaw. "Watch that, runt, or I'll get 
off and put my foot in your 
mouth and pull you on like a 
boot!" 



"Will you now," he said nastily, 
"you son of a bitch?" 

And he drew on me . . . and 
I goddam near fell backwards off 
my saddle! 

I swear, I hadn't even seen 
his hand' move, he'd drawn so 
fast! That gun just practically 
appeared in his hand! 

"Will you now?" he said again, 
and the bore of his gun looked 
like a greased gate to hell. 

I sat in my saddle scared spitless. 
wondering if this was w 7 hen I 
was going to die. I moved ray 
hands out away from my body, 
and tried to look friendlylike — 
actually, I'd never tangled with 
Buck, just razzed him a little 
now and then like everybody did : 
and I couldn't see much reason 
why he'd want to kill me. 

But the expression on his face 
was full of gloating, full of wild- 
ness, full of damn-you recklessness 
— exactly the expression you'd 
look to find on a kid like Buck 
who suddenly found out he was 
the deadliest gunman alive. 

And that's just what he was, 
believe me. 

Once I saw Bat Masterson 
draw and he was right up 
there with the very best. Could 
draw and shoot accurately in 
maybe half a second or so — you 
could hardly see his hand move; 
you just heard the slap of hand 
on gunbutt, and a split-second 
later the shot. It takes a lot of 
practise to be able to get a gun 



54 



 



out and on target in that space 
of time, and that's what makes 
gunmen. Practise, and a knack to 
begin with. And, I guess, the yen 
to be a gunman, like Buck Tar- 
rant'd always had. 

When I saw Masterson draw 
against Jeff Steward in Abilene, 
it was that way — slap, crash, 
and Steward was three-eyed. Just 
a blur of motion. 

But when Buck Tarrant drew 
on me, right now in the Pass, 
I didn't see any motion atall. 
He just crouched, and then his 
gun was on me. Must have done 
it in a millionth of a second, if a 
second has millionths. 

It was the fastest draw I'd 
ever seen. It was, I reckoned, 
the fastest draw anybody's ever 
seen. It was an impossibly fast 
draw — a man's hand just 
couldn't move to his holster that 
fast, and grab and drag a heavy 
Peacemaker up in a two foot arc 
that fast. 

It was plain damn impossible 
— but there it was. 

And there I was. 

I didn't say a word. I just sat 
and thought about things, and 
my horse wandered a little farther 
up the slope and then stopped 
to chomp grass. All the time, 
Buck Tarrant was standing there, 
poised, that wild gloating look in 
his eyes, knowing he could kill me 
anytime and knowing I knew it. 

When he spoke, his voice was 

THE DRAW 



shaky — it sounded like he 
wanted to bust out laughing, and 
not a nice laugh either. 

"Nothing to say, Doolin?" he 
said. "Pretty fast, huh?" 

I said, "Yeah, Buck. Pretty 
fast." And my voice was shaky 
too, but not because I felt like 
laughing any. 

He spat, eying me arrogantly. 
The ground rose to where he 
stood, and our heads were about 
on a level. But I felt he was 
looking down. 

"Pretty fast!" he sneered. 
"Faster'n anybody!" 

"I reckon it is, at that," I said. 

"Know how I do it?" 

"No." 

"I think, Doolin. I think my 
gun into my hand. How d'you 
like that?" 

"It's awful fast, Buck." 

"I just think, and my gun is 
there in my hand. Some draw, 
huh!" 

"Sure is." 

"You're damn right it is, Doo- 
lin. Faster'n anybody!" 

I didn't know what his gabbling 
about "thinking his gun into his 
hand" meant — at least not 
then, I didn't — but I sure wasn't 
minded to question him on it. 
He looked wild-eyed enough right 
now to start taking bites out of 
the nearest tree. 

He spat again and looked me 
up and down. "You know, you 
can go to hell, Joe Doolin. You're 
a lousy, God damn, white-livered 

55 



son of a bitch." He grinned coldly. 

Not an insult, I knew now, 
but a deliberate taunt. I'd broken 
jaws for a lot less — I'm no runt, 
and I'm quick enough to hand 
back crap if some lands on me. 
But now I wasn't interested. 

He saw I was mad, though, 
and stood waiting. 

"You're fast enough, Buck," 
I said, "so I got no idea of trying 
you. You want to murder me, 
I guess I can't stop you — but 
I ain't drawing. No, sir, that's 
for sure." 

"And a coward to boot," he 
jeered. 

"Maybe," I said. "Put your- 
self in my place, and ask yourself 
why in hell I should kill myself?" 

"Yellow!" he snarled, looking 
at me with his bulging eyes full 
of meanness and confidence. 

My shoulders got tight, and 
it ran down along my gun arm. 
I never took that from a man 
before. 

"I won't draw," I said. "Reck- 
on I'll move on instead, if you'll 
let me." 

And I picked up my reins, 
moving my hands real careful- 
like, and turned my horse around 
and started down the slope. I 
could feel his eyes on me, and 
I was half-waiting for a bullet in 
the back. But it didn't come. 
Instead Buck Tarrant called, 
"Doolin!" 

I turned my head. "Yeah?" 

He was standing there in the 



same position. Somehow he re- 
minded me of a crazy, runt 
wolf — his eyes were almost yel- 
lowish, and when he talked he 
moved his lips too much, mouth- 
ing his words, and his big crooked 
teeth flashed in the sun. I guess 
all the hankering for toughness 
in him was coming out — he was 
acting now like he'd always 
wanted to — cocky, unafraid, 
mean — because now he wore a 
bigger gun than anybody. It 
showed all over him, like poison 
coming out of his skin. 

"Doolin," he called. "I'll be 
in town around three this after- 
noon. Tell Ben Randolph for me 
that he's a son of a bitch. Tell 
him he's a dunghead sheriff. Tell 
him he'd better look me up when 
I get there, or else get outa town 
and stay out. You got that?" 

"I got it, Buck." 

"Call me Mr. Tarrant, you 
Irish bastard." 

"Okay . . . Mr. Tarrant," I 
said, and reached the bottom of 
the slope and turned my horse 
along the road through the Pass. 
About a hundred yards farther 
on, I hipped around in the saddle 
and looked back. He was practis- 
ing again — the crouch, the fan- 
tastic draw, the shot. 

I rode on toward town, to 
tell Ben Randolph he'd either 
have to run or die. 

Ben was a lanky, slab-sided 
Texan who'd come up north on a 



56 



" 



drive ten years before and liked 
the Arizona climate and stayed. 
He was a good sheriff — tough 
enough to handle most men, and 
smart enough to handle the rest. 
Fourteen years of it had kept him 
lean and fast. 

When I told him about Buck, I 
could see he didn't know whether 
he was tough or smart or fast 
enough to get out of this one. 

He leaned back in his chair 
and started to light his pipe, and 
then stared at the match until 
it burned his ringers without 
touching it to the tobacco. 
"You sure, Joe?" he said. 
"Ben, I saw it four times. 
At first I just couldn't believe 
my eyes — but I tell you, he's 
fast. He's faster'n you or me or 
Hickock or anybody. God knows 
where he got it, but he's got the 
speed." 

"But," Ben Randolph said, 
lighting another match, "it just 
don't happen that way." His 
voice was almost mildly com- 
plaining. "Not overnight. Gun- 
speed's something you work on — 
it comes slow, mighty slow. You 
know that. How in hell could 
Buck Tarrant turn into a fire- 
eating gunslinger in a few days?" 
He paused and puffed. "You 
sure, Joe?" he asked again, 
through a cloud of smoke. 
"Yes." 

"And he wants me." 
"That's what he said." 
Ben Randolph sighed. "He's 

THE DRAW 



a bad kid, Joe — just a bad 
kid. If his father hadn't died, I 
reckon he might have turned out 
better. But his mother ain't big 
enough to wallop his butt the 
way it needs." 

"You took his gun away from 
him a couple times, didn't you 
Ben?" 

" Yeah. And ran him outa town 
too, when he got too pestiferous. 
Told him to get the hell home 
and help his ma." 

"Guess that's why he wants 
you." 

_ "That. And because I'm sheriff. 
I'm the biggest gun around here, 
and he don't want to start at the 
bottom, not him. He's gonna show 
the world right away." 
"He can do it, Ben." 
He sighed again. "I know. If 
what you say's true, he can sure 
show me anyhow. Still, I got to 
take him up on it. You know 
that. I can't leave town." 

I looked at his hand lying on' 
his leg — the fingers were trem- 
bling. He curled them into a 
fist, and the fist trembled. 
"You ought to, Ben," I said. 
"Of course I ought to," he 
said, a little savagely. "But I 
can't. Why, what'd happen to 
this town if I was to cut and 
run? Is there anyone else who 
could handle him? Hell, no." 

"A crazy galoot like that," 
I said slowly, "if he gets too 
damn nasty, is bound to get 
kilt." I hesitated. "Even in the 

57 



back, if he's too good to take from 
the front." 

"Sure," Ben Randolph said. 
"Sooner or later. But what about 
meantime? . . . how many peo- 
ple will he have to kill before 
somebody gets angry or nervy 
enough to kill him? That's my 
job, Joe — to take care of this 
kind of thing. Those people he'd 
kill are depending on me to get 
between him and them. Don't 
you see?" 

I got up. "Sure, Ben, I see. 
I just wish you didn't." 

He let out another mouthful 
of smoke. "You got any idea 
what he meant about thinking 
his gun into his hand?" 

"Not the slightest. Some crazy 
explanation he made up to ac- 
count for his sudden speed, I 
reckon." 

Another puff. "You figure I'm 
a dead man, Joe, huh?" 

"It looks kind of that way." 

"Yeah, it kind of does, don't 
it?" 

At four that afternoon Buck 
Tarrant came riding into town 
like he owned it. He sat his 
battered old saddle like a rajah 
on an elephant, and he held his 
right hand low beside his hip in 
an exaggerated gunman's stance. 
With his floppy hat over at a 
cocky angle, and his big eyes 
and scrawny frame, he'd have 
looked funny as hell trying to 
look like a tough hombre — ex- 



cept that he was tough now, and 
everybody in town knew it be- 
cause I'd warned them. Otherwise 
somebody might have jibed him, 
and the way things were now, 
that could lead to a sudden 
grave. 

Nobody said a word all along 
the street as he rode to the 
hitchrail in front of the Once 
Again and dismounted. There 
wasn't many people around to 
say anything — most everybody 
was inside, and all you could 
see of them was a shadow of 
movement behind a window there, 
the flutter of a curtain there. 

Only a few men sat in chairs 
along the boardwalks under the 
porches, or leaned against the 
porchposts, and they just sort 
of stared around, looking at Buck 
for a second and then looking 
off again if he turned toward 
them. 

I was standing near to where 
Buck hitched up. He swaggered 
up the steps of the saloon, his 
right hand poised, his bulging 
eyes full of hell. 

"You tell him?" he asked. 

I nodded. "He'll look you up, 
like you said." 

Buck laughed shortly. "I'll be 
waiting. I don't like that lanky 
bastard. I reckon I got some 
scores to settle with him." He 
looked at me, and his face twisted 
into what he thought was a tough 
snarl. Funny — you could see 
he really wasn't tough down in- 



58 



 



side. There wasn't any hard core 
of confidence and strength. His 
toughness was in his holster, 
and all the rest of him was acting 
to match up to it. 

"You know," he said, "I don't 
like you either, Irish. Maybe I 
oughta kill you. Hell, why not?" 

Now, the only reason I'd stayed 
out of doors that afternoon was 
I figured Buck had already had 
one chance to kill me and hadn't 
done it, so I must be safe. That's 
what I figured — he had nothing 
against me, so I was safe. And 
I had an idea that maybe, when 
the showdown came, I might be 
able to help out Ben Randolph 
somehow — if anything on God's 
Earth could help him. 

Now, though, I wished to hell 
I hadn't stayed outside. I wished 
I was behind one of them win- 
dows, looking out at somebody 
else get told by Buck Tarrant 
that niaybe he oughta kill him. 

"But I won't," Buck said, 
grinning nastily. "Because you 
done me a favor. You run off 
and told the sheriff just like I 
told you — just like the goddam 
white-livered Irish sheepherder 
you are. Ain't that so?" 

I nodded, my jaw set so hard 
with anger that the flesh felt 
stretched. 

He waited for me to move 
against him. When I didn't, he 
laughed and swaggered to the door 
of the saloon. "Come on, Irish," 
he said over his shoulder. "I'll 



buy you a drink of the best." 

I followed him in, and he went 
over to the bar, walking heavy, 
and looked old Menner right in 
the eye and said, "Give me a 
bottle of the best stuff you got 
in the house." 

Menner looked at the kid he'd 
kicked out of his place a dozen 
times, and his face was white. 
He reached behind him and got 
a bottle and put it on the bar. 

"Two glasses," said Buck Tar- 
rant. 

Menner carefully put two 
glasses on the bar. 

"Clean glasses." 

Menner polished two other 
glasses on his apron and set 
them down. 

"You don't want no money 
for this likker, do you, Menner?" 
Buck asked. 

"No, sir." 

"You'd just take it home and 
spend it on that fat heifer of a 
wife you got, and on them two 
little halfwit brats, wouldn't 
you?" 

Menner nodded. 

"Hell, they really ain't worth 
the trouble, are they?" 

"No, sir." 

Buck snickered and poured two 
shots and handed me one He 
looked around the saloon and 
saw that it was almost empty — 
just Menner behind the bar, and 
a drunk asleep with his head on 
his arms at a table near the back, 



THE DRAW 



59 



and a little gent in fancy town 
clothes fingering his drink at a 
table near the front window and 
not even looking at us. 

"Where is everybody?" he 
asked Menner. 

"Why, sir, I reckon they're 
home, most of them," Menner 
said. "It being a hot day and 
all — " 

"Bet it'll get hotter," Buck 
said, hard. 
"Yes, sir." 

"I guess they didn't want to 
really feel the heat, huh?" 
"Yes, sir." 

"Well, it's going to get so hot, 
you old bastard, that everybody '11 
feel it. You know that?" 

"If you say so, sir." 

"It might even get hot for 
you. Right now even. What do 
you think of that, huh?" 

"I — I—" 

"You thrun me outa here a 
couple times, remember?" 
"Y-yes ... but I — " 
"Look at this!" Buck said — 
and his gun was in his hand, 
and he didn't seem to have moved 
at all, not an inch. I was looking 
right at him when he did it — 
his hand was on the bar, resting 
beside his shotglass, and then 
suddenly his gun was in it and 
pointing right at old Menner's 
belly. 

"You know," Buck said, grin- 
ning at how Menner's fear was 
crawling all over his face, "I 
can put a bullet right where I 



want to. Wanta see me do it?" 

His gun crashed, and flame 
leaped across the bar, and the 
mirror behind the bar had a 
spiderweb of cracks radiating from 
a round black hole. 

Menner stood there, blood leak- 
ing down his neck from a split 
earlobe. 

Buck's gun went off again, and 
the other earlobe was a red tatter. 

And Buck's gun was back in its 
holster with the same speed it had 
come out — I just couldn't see 
his hand move. 

"That's enough for now," he 
told Menner. "This is right good 
likker, and I guess I got to have 
somebody around to push it across 
the bar for me, and you're as good 
as anybody to do jackass jobs like 
that." 

He didn't ever look at Menner 
again. The old man leaned back 
against the shelf behind the bar, 
trembling, two trickles of red 
running down his neck and stain- 
ing his shirt collar — I could see 
he wanted to touch the places 
where he'd been shot, to see how 
bad they were or just to rub at 
the pain, but he was afraid to 
raise a hand. He just stood there, 
looking sick. 

Buck was staring at the little 
man in town clothes, over by the 
window. The little man had reared 
back at the shots, and now he was 
sitting up in his chair, his eyes 
straight on Buck. The table in 



60 



 



front of him was wet where he'd 
spilled his drink when he'd 
jumped. 

Buck looked at the little guy's 
fancy clothes and small mustache 
and grinned. "Come on," he said 
to me, and picked up his drink 
and started across the floor. "Find 
out who the dude is." 

He pulled out a chair and sat 
down — and I saw he was careful 
to sit facing the front door, and 
also where he could see out the 
window. 

I pulled out another chair and 
sat. 

"Good shooting, huh?" Buck 
asked the little guy. 

"Yes," said the little guy. 
"Very fine shooting. I confess, it 
quite startled me." 

Buck laughed harshly. "Startled 
the old guy too . . ." He raised 
his voice. "Ain't that right, Mea- 
ner? Wasn't you startled?" 

"Yes, sir," came Menner's pain- 
filled voice from the bar. 

Buck looked back at the little 
man — let his insolent gaze travel 
up and down the fancy waistcoat, 
the string tie, the sharp face with 
its mustache and narrow mouth 
and black eyes. He looked longest 
at the eyes, because they didn't 
seem to be scared. 

He looked at the little guy, and 
the little guy looked at Buck, and 
finally Buck looked away. He 
tried to look wary as he did it, as 
if he was just fixing to make sure 
that nobody was around to sneak-

shoot him — but you could see 
he'd been stared down. 

When he looked back at the 
little guy, he was scowling. 
"Who're you, mister?" he said. 
"I never seen you before." 

"My name is Jacob Pratt, sir. 
I'm just traveling through to San 
Francisco. I'm waiting for the 
evening stage." 

"Drummer?" 

"Excuse me? " 

For a second Buck's face got 
ugly. "You heard me, mister. 
You a drummer?" 

" I heard you, young man, but I 
don't quite understand. Do you 
mean, am I a musician? A per- 
former upon the drums?" 

"No, you goddam fool — I 
mean, what're you selling? Snake- 
bite medicine? Likker? Soap?" 

"Why— I'm not selling any- 
thing. I'm a professor, sir." 

"Well, I'll be damned." Buck 
looked at him a little more care- 
fullv. "A perfessor, huh? Of 
what?" 

"Of psychology, sir." 

"What's that?" 

"It's the study of man's be- 
havior—of the reasons why we 
act as we do." 

Buck laughed again, and it was 
more of a snarl. "Well, perfessor, 
you just stick around here then, 
and I'll show you some real rea- 
sons for people acting as they do! 
From now on, I'm the big reason 
in this town . . . they'll jump 
when I yell frog, or else!"

His hand was flat on the table 
in front of him — and suddenly 
his Peacemaker was in it, pointing 
at the professor's fourth vest but- 
ton. "See what I mean huh?" 

The little man blinked. " Indeed 
I do," he said, and stared at the 
gun as if hypnotized. Funny, 
though — he still didn't seem 
scared — just a lot interested. 

Sitting there and just listening, 
I thought about something else 
funny — how they were both just 
about of a size, Buck and the pro- 
fessor, and so strong in different 
ways: with the professor, you felt 
he was strong inside — a man who 
knew a lot, about things and 
about himself — while with Buck 
it was all on the outside, on the 
surface: he was just a milksop kid 
with a deadly sting. 

Buck was still looking at the 
professor, as carefully as he had 
before. He seemed to hesitate for 
a second, his mouth twisting. 
Then he said, "You're an eddi- 
cated man, ain't you? I mean, you 
studied a lot. Ain't that right?" 

"Yes, I suppose it is." 

"Well . . ." Again Buck seemed 
to hesitate. The gun in his hand 
lowered until the end of the barrel 
rested on the table. "Look," he 
said slowly, "maybe you can tell 
me how in hell . . ." 

When he didn't go on, the pro- 
fessor said, "Yes?" 

"Nothing." 

"You were going to say — ?" 



Buck looked at him, his bulging 
eyes narrowed, the gunman's 
smirk on his lips again. "Are you 
telling me what's true and what 
ain't," he said softly, "with my 
gun on you?" 

' ' Does ' the gun change any- 
thing?" 

Buck tapped the heavy barrel 
on the table. "I say it changes a 
hell of a lot of things." Tap went 
the barrel. "You wanta argue?" 

"Not with the gun," the pro- 
fessor said calmly. "It always 
wins. I'll talk with you, however, 
if you'll talk with your mouth 
instead of with the gun." 

By this time I was filled with 
admiration for the professor's 
guts, and fear that he'd get a bul- 
let in them ... I was all set to 
duck, in case Buck should lose his 
temper and start throwing lead. 

But suddenly Buck's gun was 
back in his holster. I saw the pro- 
fessor blink again in astonish- 
ment. 

"You know," Buck said, grin- 
ning loosely, "you got a lotta 
nerve, professor. Maybe you can 
tell me what I wanta know." 

He didn't look at the little man 
while he talked — he was glanc- 
ing around, being "wary" again. 
And grinning that grin at the same 
time. You could see he was off- 
balance — he was acting like 
everything was going on just like 
he wanted it; but actually the 
professor had beaten him again,

words against the gun, eyes against 
eyes. 

The professor's dark eyes were 
level on Buck's right now. "What 
is it you want to know?" 

"This — " Buck said, and his 
gun was in his hand again, and it 
was the first time when he did it 
that his face stayed sober and 
kind of stupid-looking, his normal 
expression, instead of getting wild 
and dangerous. "How — do you 
know how do I do it?" 



"Well," the professor said, 
"suppose you give me your an- 
swer first, if you have one. It 
might be the right one." 

" r — " Buck shook his head — 
"Well, it's like I think the gun 
into my hand. It happened the 
first time this morning. I was 
standing out in the Pass where I 
always practise drawing, and I 
was wishing I could draw faster'n 
anybody who ever lived — 1 was 





"Trinkets, beads — beads, trinkets! How about a bottle of gin once in awhile?" 



63 



wishing I could just get my gun 
outa leather in no time atall. 
And — " the gun was back in his 
holster in the blink of an eye — 
"that's how it happened. My gun 
was in my hand. Just like that. I 
didn't even reach for it — I was 
just getting set to draw, and had 
my hand out in front of me . . . 
and my gun was in my hand be- 
fore I knew what'd happened. 
God, I was so surprised I almost 
fell over!" 

"I see," said the professor 
slowly. "You think it into your 
hand?" 

"Yeah, kind of." • 

"Would you do it now, please? " 
And the professor leaned forward 
so he could Buck's holster, 
eyes intent. 

Buck's gun appeared in his 
hand. 

The professor let out a long 
breath. "Now think it back into 
its holster." 

It was there. 

"You did not move your arm 
either time," said the professor. 

"That's right," said Buck. 

"The gun was just suddenly in 
your hand instead of in your 
holster. And then it was back in 
the holster." 

"Right." 

"Telekinesis," said the pro- 
fessor, almost reverently. 
"Telewhat?" 

' ' Telekinesis — the moving of 
material objects by mental force." 
The professor leaned back and 

64 



studied the holstered gun. "It 
must be that. I hardly dared think 
it at first — the first time you did 
it. But the thought did occur to 
me. And now I'm virtually cer- 
tain!" 

"How do you say it?" 

' ' T-e-l-e-k-i-n-e-s-i-s. ' ' 

"Well, how do I do it?" 

"I can't answer that. Nobody 
knows. It's been the subject of 
many experiments, and there are 
many reported happenings - — but 
I've never heard of any instance 
even remotely as impressive as 
this." The professor leaned across 
the table again. "Can you do it 
with other things, young man?" 

"What other things?" 

"That bottle on the bar, for 
example." 

"Never tried." 

"Try." 

Buck stared at the bottle. 

It wavered. Just a little. Rocked, 
and settled back. 

Buck stared harder, eyes bulg- 
ing. 

The bottle shivered. That was 
all. 

"Hell," Buck said. "I can't 
seem to — to get ahold of it with 
my mind, like I can with my gun." 

"Try moving this glass on the 
table," the professor said. "It's 
smaller, and closer." 

Buck stared at the glass. It 
moved a fraction of an inch across 
the tabletop. No more. 

Buck snarled like a dog and 

 



swatted the glass with his hand, 
knocking it halfway across the 
room. 

"Possibly," the professor said, 
after a moment, "you can do it 
with your gun because you want 
to so very badly. The strength of 
your desire releases — or creates 
— whatever psychic forces are 
necessary to perform the act." 
He paused, looking thoughtful. 
"Young man, suppose you try to 
transport your gun to — say, to 
the top of the bar." 

"Why?" Buck asked suspi- 
ciously. 

" I want to see whether distance 
is a factor where the gun is con- 
cerned. Whether you can place 
the gun that far away from you, or 
whether the power operates only 
when you want your gun in your 
hand." 

"No," Buck said in an ugly 
voice. "Damn if I will. I'd maybe 
get my gun over there and not be 
able to get it back, and then 
you'd jump me — the two of you. 
I ain't minded to experiment 
around too much, thank you." 

"All right," the professor said, 
as if he didn't care. "The sugges- 
tion was purely in the scientific 
spirit — " 

"Sure," said Buck. "Sure. Just 
don't get any more scientific, or 
I'll experiment on how many holes 
you can get in you beTore you 
die." 

The professor sat back in his 
chair and looked Buck right in 



the eye. After a second, Buck 
looked away, scowling. 

Me, I hadn't said a word the 
whole while, and I wasn't talking 
now. 

"Wonder where that goddam 
yellow-bellied sheriff is?" Buck 
said. He looked out the window, 
then glanced sharply at me. "He 
said he'd come, huh?" 

"Yeah." When I was asked, I'd 
talk. 

We sat in silence for a few mo- 
ments. 

The professor said, "Young 
man, you wouldn't care to come 
with me to San Francisco, would 
you? I and my colleagues would 
be very grateful for the opportu- 
nity to investigate this strange gift 
of yours — we would even be 
willing to pay you for your time 
and -" 

Buck laughed. "Why, hell, I 
reckon I got bigger ideas'n that, 
mister! Real big ideas. There's no 
man alive I can't beat with a gun ! 
I'm going to take Billy the Kid 
. . . Hickock ... all of them! 
I'm going to get myself a rep 
bigger'n all theirs put together. 
Why, when I walk into a saloon, 
they'll hand me likker. I walk 
into a bank, they'll give me the 
place. No lawman from Canada 
to Mexico will even stay in the 
same town with me! Hell, what 
could you give me, you goddam 
little dude?" 

The professor shrugged. "Noth- 
ing that would satisfy you." 



THE DRAW 



65 



"That's right." Suddenly Buck 
stiffened, looking out the window. 
He got up, his bulging blue eyes 
staring down at us. "Randolph's 
coming down the street! You two 
just stay put, and maybe — just 
maybe — I'll let you live. Pro- 
fessor, I wanta talk to you some 
more about this telekinesis stuff. 
Maybe I can get even faster than I 
am, or control my bullets better at 
long range. So you be here, get 
that?" 

He turned and walked out the 
door. 

The professor said, "He's not 
sane." 

"Nutty as a locoed steer," I 
said. "Been that way for a long 
time. An ugly shrimp who hates 



everything — and now he's in the 
saddle holding the reins, and some 
people are due to get rode down." 
I looked curiously at him. "Look, 
professor — this telekinesis stuff 
— is all that on the level? " 
"Absolutely." 

"He just thinks his gun into 
his hand?" 
"Exactly." 

' 1 Faster than anyone could ever 
draw it?" 

"Inconceivably faster. The time 
element is almost non-existent." 

I got up, feeling worse than I'd 
ever felt in my life. "Come on," I 
said. "Let's see what happens." 

As if there was any doubt about 
what was bound to happen. 

We stepped out onto the porch 
and over to the rail. Behind us, I

heard Menner come out too. I 
looked over my shoulder. He'd 
wrapped a towel around his head. 
Blood was leaking through it. He 
was looking at Buck, hating him 
clear through. 

The street was deserted except 
for Buck standing about twenty 
feet away, and, at the far end, 
Sheriff Ben Randolph coming 
slowly toward him, putting one 
foot ahead of the other in the 
dust. 

A few men were standing on 
porches, pressed back against the 
walls, mostly near doors. Nobody 
was sitting now — -they were 
ready to groundhog if lead started 
flying wild. 

"God damn it," I said in a low, 
savage voice. "Ben's too good a 
man to get kilt this way. By a 
punk kid with some crazy psy- 
chowhosis way of handling a 
gun." 

I felt the professor's level eyes 
on me, and turned to look at him. 

"Why," he said, "doesn't a 
group of you get together and 
face him down? Ten guns against 
his one. He'd have to surrender." 

"No, he wouldn't," I said. 
"That ain't the way it works. 
He'd just dare any of us to be the 
first to try and stop him — and 
none of us would take him up on 
it. A group like that don't mean 
anything — it'd be each man 
against Buck Tarrant, and none 
of us good enough." 



"I see," the professor said 
softly. 

"God ..." I clenched my 
fists so hard they hurt. "I wish 
we could think his gun right back 
into the holster or something!" 

Ben and Buck were about forty 
feet apart now. Ben was coming 
on steadily, his hand over his 
gunbutt. He was a good man with 
a gun, Ben — nobody around 
these parts had dared tackle him 
for a long time. But he was out- 
classed now, and he knew it. I 
guess he was just hoping that 
Buck's first shot or two wouldn't 
kill him, and that he could place a 
good one himself before Buck let 
loose any more. 

But Buck was a damn good 
shot. He just wouldn't miss. 

The professor was staring at 
Buck with a strange look in his 
eyes. 

"He should be stopped," he 
said. 

"Stop him, then," I said sourly. 

"After all," he mused, "if the 
ability to perform telekinesis lies 
dormant in all of us, and is re- 
leased by strong faith and desire 
to accomplish something that can 
be accomplished only by that 
means — then our desire to stop 
him might be able to counter his 
desire to — " 

"Damn you and your big 
words," f said bitterly. 

"It was your idea," the pro- 
fessor said, still looking at Buck. 
"What you said about thinking 



67 



his gun back into its holster — 
after all, we are two to his one — " 

I turned around and stared at 
him, really hearing him for the 
first time. "Yeah, that's right — 
I said that! My God ... do you 
think we could do it?" 

"We can try," he said. "We 
know it can be done, and evidently 
that is nine-tenths of the battle. 
He can do it, so we should be able 
to. We must want him not to 
more than he wants to." 

"Lord," I said, "I want him 
not to, all right . . ." 

Ben and Buck were about 
twenty feet apart now, and Ben 
stopped. 

His voice was tired when he 
said, "Any time, Buck." 

"You're a hell of a sheriff," 
Buck sneered. "You're a no-good 




"And now, Mr. Mafoogle, would you 
mind telling the court where you were 
— er, hatched?" 



bastard." \ 

"Cuss me out," Ben said. 
"Don't hurt me none. I'll be 
ready when you start talking with 
guns." 

"I'm ready now, beanpole," 
Buck grinned. "You draw first, 
huh?" 

" Think of his gun!" the profes- 
sor said in a fierce whisper. "Try 
to grab it with your mind — 
break his aim — pull it away from 
him — you know it can be done! 
Think, think — " 

Ben Randolph had never in 
anyone's knowledge drawn first 
against a man. But now he did, 
and I guess nobody could blame 
him. 

He slapped leather, his face 
already dead — and Buck's Peace- 
maker was in his hand — 

And me and the professor were 
standing like statues on the porch 
of the Once Again, thinking at 
that gun, glaring at it, fists 
clenched, our breath rasping in 
our throats. 

The gun appeared in Buck's 
hand, and wobbled just as he 
slipped hammer. The bullet 
sprayed dust at Ben's feet. 

Ben's gun was halfway out. 

Buck's gunbarrel pointed down 
at the ground, and he was trying 
to lift it so hard his hand got 
white. He drove a bullet into the 
dust at his own feet, and stared to 
whine. 

Ben's gun was up and aiming. 
Buck shot himself in the foot. 



68 



 



Then Ben shot him once in the 
right elbow, once in the right 
shoulder. Buck screamed and 
dropped his gun and threw out his 
arms, and Ben, who was a thor- 
ough man, put a bullet through 
his right hand, and another one on 
top of it. 

Buck sat in the dust and flapped 
blood all around, and bawled 
when we came to get him. 

The professor and I told Ben 
Randolph what had happened, 
and nobody else. I think he be- 
lieved us. 

Buck spent two weeks in the 
town jail, and then a year in the 
state pen for pulling on Randolph, 
and nobody's seen him now for 
six years. Don't know what hap- 
pened to him, or care much. I 
reckon he's working as a cowhand 
someplace — anyway, he sends 
his mother money now and then, 
so he must have tamed down 
some and growed up some too. 

While he was in the town jail, 
the professor talked to him a lot 
— the professor delayed his trip 
just to do it. 

One night he told me, "Tarrant 
can't do anything like that again. 
Not at all, even with his left hand. 
The gunfight destroyed his faith 
in his ability to do it — or most of 
it, anyway. And I finished the 
job, I guess, asking all my ques- 



tions. I guess you can't think too 
much about that sort of thing." 

The professor went on to San 
Francisco, where he's doing some 
interesting experiments. Or trying 
to. Because he has the memory of 
what happened that day — but, 
like Buck Tarrant, not the abil- 
ity to do anything like that any 
more. He wrote me a couple times, 
and it seems that ever since that 
time he's been absolutely unable 
to do any telekinesis. He's tried a 
thousand times and can't even 
move a feather. 

So he figures it was really me 
alone who saved Ben's life and 
stopped Buck in his tracks. 

I wonder. Maybe the professor 
just knows too much not to be 
some skeptical, even with what he 
saw. Maybe the way he looks at 
things and tries to find reasons for 
them gets in the way of his faith. 

Anyway, he wants me to come 
to San Francisco and get experi- 
mented on. Maybe someday I 
will. Might be fun, if I can find 
time off from my job. 

I got a lot of faith, you see. 
What I see, I believe. And when 
Ben retired last year, I took over 
his job as sheriff — because I'm 
the fastest man with a gun in 
these parts. Or, actually, in the 
world. Probably if I wasn't the 
peaceable type, I'd be famous or 
something.

OPERATION LORELIE 



BY WILLIAM P. SALTON 



It was a new time and a vast new war of complete and 
awful annihilation. Yet, some things never change, 
and, as in ancient times, Ulysses walked again — 
brave and unconquerable — and again, the sirens wove 
their deadly spell with a smile and a song. 



blurred footsteps in the dust and 
the two men, clumsy in their 
bulky suits, found the going dif- 
ficult. 

They stopped, and one of them 
held out an instrument. He stud- 
ied the dial. "All clear," and both 
men removed their helmets. They 
wiped sweat from their faces and 
glanced at each other. 




75 



They came like monsters, rather 
than men, into the vast ruin 
of what had once been a great 
city. They walked carefully, side 
by side, speaking to each other by 
radio as though they were in deep 
space rather than upon solid 
ground. 

The winding way they followed 
through the ruins was marked by 



The blonde man said, "The 
air's okay, Jarvis. Everything 
seems all right. I don't get it." 

Jarvis, his dark eyes wary, 
scowled as he looked about. "It 
seems all right. But we know it 
isn't. It can't be." 

"I'm shucking this suit." 

"Don't be a fool, Mark!" 

"But the dial read clear, man! 
And we know nobody is going 
to shoot us. All life had to be 
wiped out." 

"How about minor power in- 
stallations?" 

Jarvis took a chocolate bar 
from his pocket, sat down on a 
piece of broken rubble and began 
to eat. "You're too careless — 
far too careless, Mark." 

Mark laughed. "You've always 
been cautious enough for both of 
us. Got me out of plenty of scrapes 
back in school, too. Don't think 
I've forgotten." Affection warmed 
his blue eyes as they rested on the 
face of his friend. 

"Okay! Okay! But what hap- 
pened to them? Where did they 
go?" Jarvis took nervous bites 
from his second chocolate bar. 
Then he, too, peeled off his suit. 
He sniffed the air distrustfully, as 
he wiggled his shoulders to free 
them from the clinging, damp 
shirt. Then he took a few experi- 
mental steps forward. 

"Seems all right, Mark. But 
how do you explain about Hank 
and Garland? Never were two 
more careful guys." 



"Probably a simple miscalcula- 
tion. Or an accident. We know it 
couldn't have been enemy action. 
Tests prove conclusively that we 
wiped them out — to a man." 
He took deep gulps of air into his 
lungs, and* stretched like a cat. 
"We'll find out soon enough. Boy, 
I feel great!" 

They deflated and folded their 
safety suits and added the bundles 
to the other equipment on their 
backs. Then, with their instru- 
ments held before them, they 
probed their way into the twisted 
wreckage, still following the faint, 
dust-filled footprints. 

Bent and rusted girders rose on 
all sides like the bones of prehis- 
toric monsters. Nothing stirred. 
The dust lay ages-thick on every- 
thing. 

"Gives you the spooks, doesn't 
it?" Jarvis was still tense, poised 
to respond to the first signal of 
danger. ' ' Feels like we're the last 
men alive!" 

"Funny about Hank and Gar- 
land. There's nothing here to 
harm anyone." 

Jarvis looked at his watch. 
"Better contact HQ for instruc- 
tions." 

The two stepped off the path, 
into the shade of a grotesque 
chunk of broken masonry. Mark 
set up the radio and twirled the 
dials. "Team Four, calling HQ. 
Team Four, reporting!" 

"HQ here." The voice from the 



76 



 



radio blared loud in the stillness. 
"Give your report, Team Four." 

"Looks like nothing's moved 
here in a thousand years. Safe as 
a baby's dream. Rock-solid, air 
morning-pure. But — " He hesi- 
tated, trying not to sound like a 
scared school boy. "No sign of 
Team Three. Or of Teams One 
and Two, either. Over." 

"Look here., Team Four. It's 
your job to find out. The earth 
didn't just swallow them. Final 
report from each team placed 
them well within the city. It's 
been ten days since the last con- 
tact. Probe every inch of the 
place." 

"Right!" 

"But be careful. We can't af- 
ford to lose any more men! 
Roger!" 

"Roger!" 

There was only one way now — 
ahead. It lay clearly marked. The 
dim footsteps never strayed or 
faltered. Three hours of search 
revealed no pitfalls, no dangers, 
and no trace of the missing men. 
Then night was upon them and 
they bedded down gratefully. 

"Strange, isn't it? The war 
over. The invaders blasted from 
the earth. All peril gone. And yet 
— men disappear." 

Jarvis stared at the ruins 
around them. "I can't take much 
more, Mark. Twelve years of war 
is enough. Are we never to have 
a life — have our home and 
women back, and — peace?" 



"Sure it's been tough. But 
think of the women and children 
isolated on that sub-satellite. It's 
tougher for them — just waiting." 
Stretched on his back, Mark 
stared at the cloudless, evening 
sky. "But pretty soon we'll get 
this planet cleaned up and bring 
them in. Christ! Four years with- 
out even seeing a woman. I re- 
member the last time — " 

"Okay!" Jarvis interrupted im- 
patiently. "Let's get to sleep." 

"Sure, pal. Goodnight." 

They fell asleep to dream of 
green hills, corn ripening, apples 
roasting over an open fire. Peace, 
and home, and girls, their firm 
legs flashing in the sun. 

Soldierlike, Mark was suddenly 
awake. He lay without motion, 
sensitive to some subtle change 
in the surroundings. From the 
corner of his eye he could see 
Jarvis wrapped in sleep. The si- 
lence seemed eternal. 

Then, whisper-soft, came a 
murmur, a sound, a voice. A girl's 
voice, sighing and singing, from 
deep in that devasted spot. 

A woman! 

Instantly, Mark was on his 
feet. No need to wake Jarvis. 
Plenty of time for Jarvis to find 
out — afterwards. But not yet! 
A miracle that a girl had survived 
in all that wreckage. But a miracle 
he wanted to savour alone! 

Ahead, the path turned and 
Mark followed it as it went for- 



OPERATION LORELIE 



77 



ward again, downhill, between 
the massed walls of rubble. Now 
the voice swelled, a melancholy 
song. Well, she won't be melan- 
choly for long, Mark thought. Her 
solitary ordeal was over. 

"Mark!" Jarvis stood on an 
upturned lintel, ten feet above 
Mark's head. As Mark jerked to 
a stop at the cry, Jarvis jumped 
into his path. "You fool! Don't 
you know it's a trap?" 

"So that's how you want to 
play it? The noble friend, pro- 
tecting me from myself!" He 
slammed a fist into the side of 
Jarvis' head. "Well, I won't bite! 
She's mine! I found her!" 

In silence, in the narrow passage 
between the rocks, the two fought. 
Suddenly, above the sound of fist 
on flesh, came the voice of the 
girl again, clear, young. "She is 
there," thought Jarvis. He could 
almost taste her lips on his. The 
sensation came as a shock. How 
did he know? He'd never had a 
woman. That's what came from 
listening to the tales of Mark's 
exploits with women. Now he had 
to have that girl ! 

The mounting tension of the 
fighting snapped something in 
Jarvis' seething mind. Danger, 
friendship, duty, all meant noth- 
ing. Only one thing mattered. 
The girl! Mark had had more 
than his share of girls. He Jarvis, 
was the one who should have her! 
He'd been deprived of his man- 

78 



hood long enough! His frenzied 
brain hunted a trick to gain his 
ends. 

Mark's superior strength be- 
gan to force Jarvis to give ground. 
Then a final blow sent him reeling, 
he reached out to break his fall, 
his hand closed on a rock. He 
threw it. Mark crashed to the 
ground, his knee smashed, his leg 
useless. Then the tomb stillness 
of the dead city took over. The 
dust settled slowly. Mark came to 
his feet. 
Jarvis was gone. 
Dragging his useless leg, Mark 
forced himself to crawl forward. 
Jarvis had to be stopped. 

Ahead, a shadow moved, and 
for a moment the moon threw the 
silhouette of a man against a 
cavernous opening in the debris. 
"Jarvis!" 

An electric flash shattered the 
darkness. The jagged teeth of the 
bolt spit tongues of fire. Cordite 
mingled with the raw, nauseant, 
revolting smell of scorched flesh 
and hair. The figure tottered and 
fell into the black mouth of the 
cave. Then, as the flame faded, it 
lit up small bundles of charred 
bones near the fallen body. 

There was a whir and a click 
of a mechanism. Fifteen feet 
away, Mark watched as the arm 
of a phonograph rose, moved 
slowly back to the starting point. 
Then the record began once more 
to grind out its death-trap melody. 

 



KEEP OUT 



BY FREDERIC BROWN 

With no more room left on Earth, and with Mars hang- 
ing up there empty of life, somebody hit on the plan of 
starting a colony on the Red Planet. It meant changing 
the habits and physical structure of the immigrants, but 
that worked out fine. In fact, every possible factor was cov- 
ered _ gxcept one of the flaws of human nature. . . . 



-pvAPTiNE is the secret of it. 
i_) Adaptine, they called it first; 
then it got shortened to daptine. 
It let us adapt. 

They explained it all to us when 
we were ten years old ; I guess they 
thought- we were too young to 
understand before then, although 



we knew a lot of it already. They 
told us just after we landed on 
Mars. 

"You're home, children, the 
Head Teacher told us after we had 
gone into the glassite dome they'd 
built for us there. And he told us 
there'd be a special lecture for us 

79 



that evening, an important one 
that we must all attend. 

And that evening he told us the 
whole story and the whys and 
wherefores. He stood up before us. 
He had to wear a heated space 
suit and helmet, of course, be- 
cause the temperature in the dome 
was comfortable for us but already 
freezing cold for him and the air 
was already too thin for him to 
breathe. His voice came to us by 
radio from inside his helmet. 

"Children," he said, "you are 
home. This is Mars, the planet on 
which you will spend the rest of 
your lives. You are Martians, the 
first Martians. You have lived 
five years on Earth and another 
five in space. Now you will spend 
ten years, until you are adults, 
in this dome, although toward the 
end of that time you will be al- 
lowed to spend increasingly long 
periods outdoors. 

"Then you will go forth and 
make your own homes, live your 
own lives, as Martians. You will 
intermarry and your children will 
breed true. They too will be 
Martians. 

"It is time you were told the 
history of this great experiment of 
which each of you is a part." 

Then he told us. 

Man, he said, had first reached 
Mars in 1985. It had been unin- 
habited by intelligent life (there is 
plenty of plant life and a few 
varieties of non-flying insects) and 
he had found it by terrestrial 



standards uninhabitable. Man 
could survive on Mars only by 
living inside glassite domes and 
wearing space suits when he went 
outside of them. Except by day 
in the warmer seasons it was too 
cold for him. The air was too thin 
for him to breathe and long ex- 
posure to sunlight — less filtered 
of rays harmful to him than on 
Earth because of the lesser at- 
mosphere — could kill him. The 
plants were chemically alien to 
him and he could not eat them; 
he had to bring all his food from 
Earth or grow it in hydroponic 
tanks. 

For fifty years he had tried to 
colonize Mars and all his efforts 
had failed. Besides this dome 
which had been built for us there 
was only one other outpost, an- 
other glassite dome much smaller 
and less than a mile away. 

It had looked as though man- 
kind could never spread to the 
other planets of the solar system 
besides Earth for of all of them 
Mars was the least inhospitable; 
if he couldn't live here there was 
no use even trying to colonize the 
others. 

And then, in 2034, thirty years 
ago, a brilliant biochemist named 
Waymoth had discovered daptine. 
A miracle drug that worked not 
on the animal or person to whom 
it was given but on the progeny he 
conceived during a limited period 
of time after inoculation. 



80 



 



It gave his progeny almost 
limitless adaptability to changing 
conditions, provided the changes 
were made gradually. 

Dr. Waymoth had innoculated 
and then mated a pair of guinea 
pigs; they had borne a litter of 
five and by placing each member 
of the litter under different and 
gradually changing conditions, he 
had obtained amazing results. 
When they attained maturity one 
of those guinea pigs was living 
comfortably at a temperature of 
forty below zero Fahrenheit, an- 
other was quite happy at a hun- 
dred and fifty above. A third was 
thriving on a diet that would have 
been deadly poison for an ordinary 
animal and a fourth was contented 
under a constant X-ray bombard- 
ment that would have killed one 
of its parents within minutes. 

Subsequent experiments with 
many litters showed that animals 
who had been adapted to similar 
conditions bred true and their 
progeny was conditioned from 
birth to live under those condi- 
tions. 

"Ten years later, ten years 
ago," the Head Teacher told us, 
"you children were born. Born of 
parents carefully selected from 
those who volunteered for the ex- 
periment. And from birth you 
have been brought up under care- 
fully controlled and gradually 
changing conditions. 

"From' the time you were born 
the air you have breathed has 

KEEP OUT 



been very gradually thinned and 
its oxygen content reduced. Your 
lungs have compensated by be- 
coming much greater in capacity, 
which is why your chests are so 
much larger than those of your 
teachers and attendants; when 
you are fully mature and are 
breathing air like that of Mars, 
the difference will be even greater. 

"Your bodies are growing fur to 
enable you to stand the increasing 
cold. You are comfortable now 
under conditions which would kill 
ordinary people quickly. Since you 
were four years old your nurses 
and teachers have had to wear 
special protection to survive con- 
ditions that seem normal to you.

SORRY: 

Wrong Dimension 

BY ROSS ROCKLYNNE 

So the baby had a pet monster. And so nobody but 
baby coidd see it. And so a couple of men dropped 
out of thin air to check and see if the monster 
was licensed or not. So what's strange about that? 



Fby didn't cry all day, because 
he had a monster for a play- 
mate. But I didn't know he had a 
playmate, and much less did I 
know it was a monster. The hon- 
est truth is that for the first time 
since baby was born, I had my 
nerves under control, and I didn't 
dare investigate why he wasn't 
crying. I got all the ironing done 
— all of it, mind you — and I got 
Harry's work-clothes mended and 
I also read three installments of 
a Saturday Evening Post serial I'd 
been saving. And besides this 
Mabel, my neighbor, and I had a 
couple or three cups of coffee. We 
also had a giggling fit. I remember 
once we went off into hysterics at 
the picture of ourselves we had — • 
two haggard old wrecks of women, 
worn out at twenty-three from too 
much work around the house. 
"But thank Heavens baby hasn't 
cried all day!" I gurgled when we 
came out of it. 

"Neither has mine," said Mabel, 
who isn't due for six months. 



"Mabel, honest, you kill me," 
I said, "and excuse me while I 
comb my messy hair — because 
I'm not a wreck. Harry said so. 
He says I'm still the best hunk of 
female pulchritude he's met since 
high school — and we've been 
married two years!" 

I went into the bathroom leav- 
ing Mabel choking hysterically 
behind me. When I came out of 
the bathroom, she was hysterical 
but in a different way. She'd dis- 
covered why Harry, Jr., wasn't 
crying. She'd been in the nursery. 
Her face was white as an egg-shell. 

"He's playing with something," 
she chattered. "It's alive. I heard 
it cooing back." 

I ran three steps to baby's crib 
. . . one on the corner of Little 
Jack Horner, one on the sheep of 
Little Bo Peep, one on the cup- 
board of Old Mother Hubbard. 
"Baby!" I almost screamed. But 
baby cooed and gurgled and 
laughed and rocked back and 



82 




83 



forth on his diapers. He was play- 
ing with his teething ring, but 
something was trying to jerk the 
teething ring out of his hands. 
And baby liked it. 

Baby lost his hold on the teeth- 
ing ring, and fell on his back. The 
teething ring stayed up in the air 
and then by itself moved toward 
baby's waving hands and let him 
get a hold of it. 

Mabel screeched through her 
teeth, "Baby's got it, the mon- 
ster's got it, now baby's got it!" 
She began to collapse. 

"Don't faint," 1 snapped, "and 
don't let's play tennis." I was 
shaking. I reached into the crib. 
My hands closed around some- 
thing that put ice-water in my 
vertebrae. It was a monster. 

"It's got fur!" I whispered. I 
felt some more. "And clammy 
scales!" I lifted it out of the crib. 
"And a trunk!" I was determined 
to save baby. Baby cried ! 

We got some chairs and sat 
there for ten minutes close to- 
gether while baby played with the 
invisible monster. "I don't know 
what to do!" I said. "It's alive. 
Maybe it's poisonous. But it's 
friendly. Maybe it's another baby!" 

" From another dimension," said 
Mabel. 

"Rot," I said; I think I picked 
that up from the detective in the 
Saturday Evening Post serial. 
"Let's keep our heads." 

"If baby keeps his," said my 

84 



friend Mabel. That got me. "I've 
got to call Harry," I chattered. 
"They don't like him to be called 
at work, but I've got to call him." 

"You'll just worry him," said 
Mabel. ' 4 Call the police." 

"No!" I said. I felt like crying 
myself. Baby was so happy. Maybe 
the baby monster was happy, too. 
The police would do something 
awful to it. But what about my 
maternal instinct? Something told 
me I simply had to save my baby ! 
"I've got to call Harry," I insisted, 
and I went to the 'phone. 

The dial tone sounded peculiar, 
■I remember, but I called Harry's 
place of employment. A brisk fe- 
male voice cut in: 

"What number are you calling, 
please? " 

"CHarlemont 7-890," I whis- 
pered. 

"Sorry. You must have the 
wrong dimension." There was a 
click as she disconnected. I sat 
like a statue. A haggard statue 
with a greasy housedress on. A 
statue that hadn't plucked its eye- 
brows in two months. I had a lot of 
nerve. I was a bad mother, and a 
poor mistress. And I had a swell 
husband, who could lie like a 
trooper. I wasn't any good, I was 
ugly, I was greasy. I cried. 
"Mabel," I choked. 

It took her awhile to get it out 
of me, and then her blue eyes 
flashed. "I told you!" she cried. 
"From another dimension!" In 
her broken-down green wedgies 

 



she clattered toward the door. I 
heard her fighting it. She couldn't 
get it open. Then she tried a win- 
dow. It opened, but she couldn't 
stick her hand out. She flung her- 
self around. 

"Stella," she said, with a quiver 
of that good-looking short upper 
lip of hers, "we're trapped in. 
We're in the middle of some kind 
of fantasy. It's a crazy world we're 
living in, Stella. A-bombs and H- 
bombs and flying saucers and 
space-flight — it's all the fiction 
stuff coming true. Now we're lost 
in some other dimension, and I 
have to get dinner in the oven." 

"Please," I mumbled. "Let's 
don't get desperate about the 
wrong things." I tried all the 
doors and windows in the house, 
and it was true. We were trapped 
in. There was some barrier sur- 
rounding the house. There wasn't 
anything to see outside except a 
kind of grey steam. 

We went back to check on baby. 
He was still playing with the mon- 
ster. I bent over the crib and held 
a fluffy, fifty-cent toy bear out. 
The baby monster took it in- 
visibly out of my hand. He shoved 
it at baby. Baby squealed so 
darned happily. And I began to 
get some perspective. 

"Suspicion is wrong," I told 
Mabel. "All the time. That's what 
that article we read a couple 
months ago in Your World said. 
Remember yo.u and I decided 
we'd never be suspicious. Maybe 



that's the reason we're happy — ■ 
if dirty. We don't suspect any- 
body of anything if we can help it 
— and now's no time to start. The 
monster is baby's friend." 

Mabel shuddered. "Okay," she 
said. "But I'm still worried about 
getting dinner in the oven. Bill's 
liable to — " 

"Hah, now you're being sus- 
picious," I said, lousy with virtue. 
"Quit worrying. I'm going to call 
Harry again." This time I was a 
lot calmer. I decided to trust the 
universe a little more. I dialed 
Harry's number again. A scratchy 
male voice answered : 

"Sorry, dis dimension is in use. 
Would ya please get off da line?" 

I dug a few trenches and estab- 
lished a line of fire. 

"Listen," I said. "I'm in trou- 
ble." 

" Adame," he said wonderingly. 

"Yeah, a dame," I cried. 
"What's so unusual about a 
dame? Why does every male in 
Kingdom Come get that note in 
his voice when he talks with a 
dame? Sure I'm a dame, a good- 
looking dame! I'd like to punch 
you in the eye to prove it!" 

He laughed. He must have 
turned away from the 'phone. 
"It's a dame." 

"Okay, find out what she 
wants." 

"Spill it," he said into the 
'phone. I spilled it. "What's that 
address again?" he asked. I told 



SORRY, WRONG DIMENSION 



85 



him. "Naw, naw," he said impa- 
tiently. "The planet. The planet. 
And the year." I told him. 

He must have turned away 
from the 'phone again, because I 
heard him say off-stage, "They're 
only ten years away." I was numb. 
He came back on the line. "And 
what's dis about a baby monster? 
Fur? Scales? A trunk? The size of 
Harry, Jr.? Ma'am, we'll be there 
in a jiff," and he hung up. 

Mabel was nervously hanging 
on my ear, but I didn't get a 
chance to answer her questions. 
The door in the living room 
opened and they walked in. 

For a second I saw a ship that 
looked like a cake-pan, hanging in 
the grey steam. Then they closed 
the door and grinned at us. In- 
stinctively, Mabel and I tried to 
shrink our bust-lines. 

"Hello," said the tall one. He 
scratched at his hairy chest and 
grinned wider. He was carrying a 
piece of machinery that looked 
like a camera on a tripod. "Lemme 
introduce myself," he said. "Jake 
Comstock. We come over to do 
you dames a favor. We'll kick you 
back where vou belong." 

"Yeah," I said, "I'll bet." 

"And this here is Beany Rocine. 
He's my partner. We — uh — 
work together." 

"Hi dere," said Beany. "Where's 
da monster?" 

"Introductions," said Jake, cast- 
ing him a hard look. "Manners." 

So I introduced us. "I'm Mrs. 



Weaver," I said. "And this is my 
neighbor, Mrs. Aspectia." 

"Pleased ta meetcha, girls," 
grinned Jake. "You, Blondie," he 
was looking at me, "you must be 
the one talked on the 'phone. I 
liked the way you handled Beany. 
Real cute." He dropped the tripod 
thing in a corner, and sidled to- 
ward me. "Now where's this mon- 
ster?" he asked, slipping his hand 
around my bare arm and grinning 
down at me. 

I knew better than to play 
rough, so I just looked down at his 
hand, and didn't stop looking at it 
until he took it away. He lost a 
lot of his grin. "So where is it?" 
he said, his voice turning hard and 
unpleasant. 

"Don't worry about that," I 
said. "Matter of fact, I'm getting 
so the monster doesn't worry me. 
He's been playing with baby all 
day and baby hasn't objected. 
The main thing I'd like you 
gentlemen to do for us is to get 
busy moving us back to our own 
dimension." 

"That's right," said Mabel, her 
hands on her hips. "And let us 
know right now what the charges 
are going to be, if any." 

"No charge," said the runt 
Beany, staring fascinated at her 
legs. "'Cept we're taking da mon- 
ster wit' us. Real expensive, them 
monsters. Drinkos, they're called. 
Dey get lost in da dimensions now 
and then. Picked one up on Pluto

fifty years or so acome — or ago." 

"Ago?" I said. 

"Acome," he corrected. 

"Listen," I said, making up my 
mind. "You can't have the mon- 
ster. He's kept baby happy all 
day. But I'll tell you what I'll do. 
Tell me what he eats and what to 
do for him and I'll keep him. I've 
got twenty-five dollars in poker 
winnings you can have. Okay — • 
Jake?" 

Jake broke out laughing. "You 
kids are terrific," he said. "You 
don't know what the score is. 
You're cute!" 

"Thanks," I said bitterly. "You 
restore my confidence. I feel my- 
self blooming under your hungry 
gaze." 

"Those Drinkos are worth a 
couple million credits, is what I'm 
getting at, and you offer us a 
stinkin' twenty-five dollars. Tell 
you what, Blondie." He winked 
at me. "You kids are over-worked. 
One look and you can tell that. 
Well, Beany and me have got a 
little cabin up on Dimension-L, 
cut off from everything. The four 
of us can go there and have a fine 
old time. We could stay there a 
month, and still get you back 
here in time to kiss your husbands 
when they get in from work. 
Whaddya say, Blondie? And you 
can keep the Drinko ! " 

"We are accepting no proposi- 
tions this week," said Mabel with 
dignity. 

"Ah-h, a coupla kill-joys," 



growled Beany, wandering off to- 1 
ward the hall. 

Mabel looked at me and then 
picked up a vase off the mantle 
over the fire-place. I gave her the 
nod. "Stay away from that 
Drinko," she warned Beany, "or 
I'll let you have it." 

Beany was annoyed. He stopped, 
looking imploringly at Jake. Jake 
giggled as if the whole thing 
tickled his sense of humor, and 
walked cat-footed toward Mabel. 
She let go the vase with a right- 
handed swing. He had his right 
arm out stiff in front of him, 
though, and the vase shied off and 
smashed against the television set. 
Then he grabbed Mabel in a bear- 
hug. 

That set me off. I had a yearn- 
ing for Harry, then. He would 
have laid these mugs out. And 
that's all they were — mugs, cheap 
crooks. I hopped on one leg, yank- 
ing off one of my oxfords. I 
brought the heel down on Jake's 
curly head. But it didn't do a 
thing for him, except make him 
mad. He brought his arm back, 
cursing at me. It caught me on my 
lipstick. I remember being sur- 
prised that he was actually knock- 
ing me out. But that's what he 
did. 

When I woke up, the first thing 
I knew was that Harry, Jr., was 
screaming. I groggily stood up, 
and stepped over Mabel, who was 
just beginning to moan. I went to 



SORRY, WRONG DIMENSION 



87 



the nursery and grabbed up my 
baby. "Don't cry," I begged him. 
"Don't be mad. I'll get your 
Drinko back. Those dirty thieves, 
I'll get it back." I held him under 
one arm, his pants dripping. I 
think I looked like a Pekinese, 
with my hair over my eyes. I went 
to the 'phone, dialed Harry's num- 
ber, and got the same routine. 

' ' I don't have the wrong dimen- 
sion," I cried before the operator 
could hang up. "This is an emer- 
gency. A couple of crooks stole my 
Drinko. Please get me the dimen- 
sion-police." 

"You have a Drinko?" the op- 
erator asked cautiously. "There 
must be some mistake. You are 
calling from Earth? From 1954? I 
am sorry. Congress ruled Earth 
1954 could not be connected with 
the dimension-system. It would be 
impossible for you to own a 
Drinko." 

"Some crooks from 1964 stole 
my Drinko!" I insisted. 

"One moment, please. The Su- 
pervisor informs me this is an un- 
authorized call. It will be necessary 
to conduct a police investigation." 
There were clickings, there were 
buzzings, there were groups of 
fuzzy, far-off voices, and finally 
the police came in. 

"A couple of crooks stole my 
baby's Drinko!" I repeated loudly. 
"I demand my rights as a dimen- 
sion-citizen!" 

"Two thieves confiscated your 
Drinko," a dry voice said. "Very 



well. Describe them, please. De- 
scribe characteristic phrases, ex- 
pressions, and voice-intonations 
also." I described them. "Very 
good. Did you say Earth 1954? 
Excellent. Only a matter of six 
dimensions and thirty years. We 
shall investigate immediately." 
He hung up. 

"Hi, Stella," said Mabel, up on 
one elbow and looking fuzzily at 
me. "You think I'll get out of this 
in time to get Bill's dinner in the 
oven? Bill's so darned touchy 
about dinner." 

"Teach him a lesson, then," I 
snapped, disgusted with her, and 
running to the door, because some- 
body was knocking there. "Train 
him. Disappoint him. Break his 
pattern. Don't have dinner. Good 
evening, gentlemen," I said as I 
opened the door. The police came 
in. They had Beany. They had 
Jake. 

There were three police. The 
one in front, a young, nice-looking 
one, touched his cap and smiled 
quietly. "Here's your Drinko, 
ma'am," he said, but I already 
knew the Drinko was back. Harry, 
Jr., stopped crying. He gurgled 
happily. Somehow, I was willing 
to bet, he could see the Drinko. I 
put him on the floor and the po- 
liceman put the Drinko on the 
floor. It was beautiful, those 
squeals that came from my baby. 
The young policeman smiled again, 
a quiet, tanned smile. 



88 



 



"We want to thank you, ma'am. 
These two are the worst criminals 
in the dimension-system. I want 
you to know you may have the 
Drinko as a reward for your part 
in apprehending them. Also, I 
wish to say that I admire you for 
your trippo in pretending to be a 
dimension-citizen, when, of course, 
you are not." 

"Trippo?" 

"Spunk, if you prefer." 

"Well, I had to get my baby's 
Drinko back," I said. 

"Naturally," he smiled. 
"Drinko's make wonderful pets. 
The day may come when Earth 
1954 will be connected with di- 
mension-system — and then more 
Drinkos will be available." 

"Can't we," I asked, "just stay 
alone in our quiet nook of space? " 

"My thought, too," said Mabel, 
getting to her feet at last and 
throwing her hair back. "And is 
there any chance of getting out of 
here? It's exciting, thrilling, and 
romantic, but Bill still has to eat." 

"Immediately, Madam! It is 
merely a matter of disengaging 
the chrono-beam, which happened 
to become tangled, in space-time, 
with the gravitonic structure of 
the neutronic chrono-field." 

"Well!" said Mabel. "That ex- 
plains it! And so clearly!" 

They set up an instrument that 
looked like the one Jake and Beany 
had. They sighted along the diag- 
onals of the room and pressed but- 
tons. Then they opened the door. 

SORRY, WRONG DIMENSION 



"In two minutes, ma'am," the 
smiling cop said. "Good day. It is 
my hope that we shall meet 
again." They disappeared out the 
door. Sure enough, there was a 
cake-pan ship hanging in the grey 
steam. They piled into it and the 
ship moved off, wobbling, until I 
couldn't see it any more. 

A minute later, the grey steam 
melted away and so did Mabel. 

Harry came home on schedule. 
"Baby has hardly cried all day!" 
I told him happily. "What a re- 
lief! I got a lot of your old clothes 
mended and I read three install- 
ments of the Saturday Evening 
Post serial." 

"Fine!" said Harry, looking 
around. "What else happened?" 

' ' Not much , " I said , deciding to 
break it to him gradually. "Except 
we've got a Drinko." I took him 
into the nursery. Baby was sound 
asleep. I supposed the Drinko was, 
too. "There he is," I said, point- 
ing to the depression at the foot of 
the crib. "That's the Drinko." I 
told Harry the whole story. He 
listened with a straight face. 

"Well!" he said. "What thrill- 
ing adventures you have. Tell me, 
isn't this sort of thing sometimes 
too exciting?" 

"Not at all," I said, deciding to 
feed his stomach before I really 
tried to convince him. "It all 
comes under the heading of the 
drab, routine duties of a house- 
wife. Come on now, dinner's 
ready."

Soft lips brushed the back of 
my neck and she said something. 
"That's fine," I said. 
"Sam!" 

I heard that, all right. I looked 
up from the typewriter. "Hey, 
that's a nice nightgown!" 

"I said I think I'm getting a 
cold." 

"Well — with a nightgown like 
that ..." 

"Silly!" Her smile would have 
corrupted a bishop. "You coming 
to bed? It's almost midnight." 

"Soon's I finish writing this 
chapter. Best thing I've ever 
done." 

"More Indians?" 

I reached for a cigarette. "Sure, 
more Indians. What else would 
one of the country's leading au- 
thorities on the original Ameri- 
cans be writing about? I hate to 
keep harping on the same subject, 
my sweet, but the dough from 
my last book bought you that 
mink stole you keep dangling in 
front of your girl friends." 

"If you make so much money 
at it, why are you still a re- 
porter?" 

"I like being a reporter." 

"What about me? Between re- 
porting and Indians my love life 
is beginning to wither on the 
vine. You should have married a 
squaw." 

"Who says I didn't?" I gave 
her my best leer and reached out 
an exploring hand. She blushed 
and backed away, laughing. "Noth- 



ing doing, Sam Quinlan! You 
want me I'll be in bed." 
"Hey-hey!" 

She gave me a quick kiss, 
evaded my grasp and disappeared 
into the bedroom. I finished light- 
ing the cigarette, typed a few 
more lines. But my working mood 
was gone, a casualty of a black 
lace nightgown. Finally I got up 
up from the desk and snapped on 
the radio and, while it warmed 
up, strolled over to the living 
room window. 

At this hour Washington was 
largely in bed. Away over to the 
east I could see the dim glow of 
lights marking the Mall, with the 
Capitol dome beyond that. Now 
that communism was dead, buried 
and unmourned in Russia and her 
satellites, with peace and pros- 
perity booming from Iowa to 
Iran, even the President would 
be sleeping like a baby. Any day 
now I would be down to covering 
PTA meetings for the Herald- 
Telegram^ That was okay with 
me; my big interest was "Saga 
of the Sioux" — the third in the 
series of books I was writing on 
the history of the American 
Indian. 

An early autumn breeze crawled 
in at the open window and moved 
the line of smoke from my ciga- 
rette. A quiet serene night, with 
the faint smell of burned leaves 
in the air and the promise of a 
cool, sunny, peaceful tomorrow.

A lovely night, made far lovelier 
by the thought of the beautiful 
blonde waiting for me in the next 
room. After twelve years of mar- 
riage I still found her to be the 
most exciting and rewarding 
woman I had ever known. 

"... most of eastern Colo- 
rado," the radio said suddenly, 
"as well as the western fringes of 
Nebraska and Kansas." 

I turned the volume down. 
Weather report, probably, except 
that the announcer was making it 
sound like a declaration of war or 
a "sincere" commercial. 

"We repeat," the voice con- 
tinued, " since 8:10 this evening, 
Eastern Standard Time, literally 
nothing has come out of that 
section of the country. All com- 
munication has ceased, outbound 
trains and planes are long over- 
due, highway traffic out of the 
area has stalled." 

"Sam?" 

"Yeah?" 

"You coming to bed?" 

"... tuned to this station for 
further bulletins con — " 

I clicked the set off. "Could I 
have three minutes for a fast 
shower?" 

"Umm ... I guess so." 

"I," I told her, "am coming to 
bed." 

Lois rattled the handle of the 
stall-shower door, and I shut off 
the water. "Yeah?" 

"Telephone, darling." 



"At this hour? Who is it?" 

"Sounds like Purcell." 

"For Crisake!" I came out and 
grabbed a towel. "This is worse 
than one of those Hollywood 
farces about honeymooners. What's 
he want?" 

"I didn't dare ask him, he 
sounded so grumpy." 

I kissed her. "About that night- 
gown . . ." 

"You're getting me all wet!" 

Purcell was night Editor at the 
Herald-Telegram, a small, intense, 
middle-aged, highly literate man. 
Years before, his wife had run off 
with a reporter, leaving Purcell 
with an undying hatred for all 
members of the profession. 

His voice, over the wire, cracked 
like a whip. "Sam?" 

"Listen, I'm off duty. You got 
any idea what time — " 

"You're wanted at the White 
House. Now." 

"The White House? You 
mean — ?" 

"The White House. The Presi- 
dent wants to see you." 

"The President! Cut out the 
gags, will you? I'm in no — " 

"I don't kid with reporters, 
Sam. On your way." 

The phone went dead. I stood 
there staring stupidly at the re- 
ceiver. Lois had to shake my arm 
to get my attention. "What did 
he want?" 

"The President wants to see 
me."

"You're joking!" 

"Hunh-uh. Anybody but Pete 
Purcell, I'd agree." I put back the 
receiver and went over to the 
dresser for clean underwear. "Get 
back to bed, honey. I'll be home 
as soon as I get through running 
the Government. Can you imag- 
ine! The President wants to see 
me!" 

She yawned and stretched, look- 
ing like the June page on an 
Esquire calendar. "Well, so much 
for my sheerest nightgown." 

"Believe me, darling, if it 
wasn't the President — " 

"I know. It would be an In- 
dian." 

I finished dressing while she sat 
on the bed with her knees drawn 
up to her chin, watching me. I 
kissed her thoroughly and patted 
her here and there and went 
downstairs. The night man in the 
garage under the building put 
down his Racing Form and dug 
my Plymouth out of a welter of 
chrome and glass. 

I drove much too fast all the way. 

A guard at the gate looked at 
my press pass and used a hidden 
telephone. Within not much more 
than seconds 1 was ushered into 
the Press Secretary's office. The 
Secretary, a badly shaken man if 
ever I'd seen one, had evidently 
been pacing the floor. He looked 
at me sharply out of pale, blood- 
shot eyes. "Your name Quin- 
lan?" 



"Yes, sir." 

" May I see your identification? " 

I handed him my wallet. He 
flipped through the panels holding 
my press pass, social security 
card, driver's license and a picture 
of Lois in a bathing suit. When he 
failed to do more than give the 
latter a casual glance I knew this 
was a man with a troubled mind. 

I said, "Maybe you could give 
me kind of a hint on what's going 
on." 

"Going on?" he repeated ab- 
sently. 

"You know — -going on." I got 
off a nonchalant-type laugh that 
would have fooled anybody who 
was deaf. "I even heard that the 
President wanted to see me!" 

He gave me back the wallet. 
"Ah — yes. Come with me, please." 

We left the office and went 
down a hall, around some corners 
and down more halls, past a lot 
of doors, all of them closed. Fi- 
nally he stopped in front of a 
pair of doors with shiny brass 
doorknobs, knocked twice, then 
turned the knob, said, "Mr. 
Quinlan, gentlemen," shoved me 
through with a jerk of his chin, 
and closed the door behind me. 

I never saw him again. 

There was a long table down 
the center of a long narrow room. 
The woodwork was white and the 
walls papered a dark green, with 
walnut-framed pictures here and 
there of the kind of men you see 
in albums of Civil War vintage. 



94 



 



But the men around the table 
were as modern as a jet bomber. 
There were five of them, three of 
whom I recognized on sight: 
Army Chief of Staff General Lu- 
cius Ohlmsted, Secretary of War 
Franklin McClave, and, seated at 
the far end of the table and look- 
ing even younger than his forty- 
nine years, the President of the 
United States. 

The remaining two were just a 
couple of men to me: dark busi- 
ness suits, clean collars, mani- 
cured fingernails and the type of 
faces you see twenty of on any 
city block. 

I walked on down the room, 
feeling as conspicuous as a cheer 
leader at a wake, while five pairs 
of eyes sorted me over molecule 
by molecule. When I reached 
the near end of the table, I stopped, 
resisted an impulse to salute, and 
stood there at attention. 

The President managed to keep 
from smiling, although you could 
see he wasn't far from it. "Thanks 
for coming here so promptly, Mr. 
Quinlan. I'd like you to meet my 
associates." 

He reeled off names and titles. 
The two strangers were a Mr. 
Proudfit and a Mr. Kramer, 
occupations not disclosed. Kramer 
was small and ageless, with a 
weather-beaten face and a mouth 
like a steel trap; while Mr. 
Proudfit had the look of a benign 
monk, until you saw the tempered 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



steel glint in his piercing eyes. 

When introductions were com- 
pleted, I said, "How do you do?" 
once, including them all, and 
went on waiting. Nobody sug- 
gested I sit down, probably be- 
cause there were only five chairs 
around the table to begin with 
and the room's two couches were 
too far away to keep me in the 
group. The President gave me 
the same winning smile that had 
pulled a couple million extra 
votes his way in the last election, 
and said, "Let me start off, Mr. 
Quinlan, by telling you that 
we've got a problem on our hands 

— one that may very well involve 
the peace and well-being of the 
entire country. The details are 
going to strain your credulity 
beyond human limits, I'm afraid 

— just as they have ours. But 
there is enough supporting evi- 
dence to what we've heard for us 
to do something about it. And 
that's where you come in." 

He paused, evidently waiting 
for a response from me. There was 
only one response I could make 

— even though I hadn't the slight- 
est idea what he was talking 
about. "I'm at your service, Mr. 
President." 

His smile was a medal for my 
chest. "Thank you. At this point 
I'd better let Mr. Kramer take 
over." 

Kramer leaned back in his 
chair, placed the tips of his fin- 
gers together and stared search- 

95 



ingly at me over them. His voice, 
when he spoke, was as dry as his 
skin. "Mr. — ah — Quinlan, I 
understand you were born thirty- 
one years ago on a Potawatomi 
Indian reservation in the state of 
Michigan." 

I blinked. "That's right. Not 
many people know it." 

"You are part Indian, I be- 
lieve?" 

"One quarter Potawatomi." 

"Also, I'm told that you are 
something of an authority on the 
history of the American Indian." 

"I've written books on the sub- 
ject and expect to write a good 
many more." 

"You speak the language?" 

"What language?" 

He floundered a little. "Why — 
ah — the — ■ ah — > Indian lan- 
guage." 

"Look, Mr. Kramer," I said, 
"there are scores of Indian lan- 
guages. Nobody in history, red 
man or white, could ever speak 
all of them. Fortunately most 
Indians belonged to one of sev- 
eral great families, and the lan- 
guage of each family was close 
enough for the tribes in that 
family to understand each other. 
I can handle the language of the 
Algonkin like a native, being part 
Potawatomi myself. I can get by 
in the tongue of the Iroquois, the 
Caddoan, the Siouan, and the 
Muskhogean. The Dene and Uto- 
Aztecan would give me consider- 



able trouble, while the Penutian 
would be just about a blank." 

I stopped there, and shrugged. 
"Sorry. I didn't mean to turn 
this into a lecture." 

Kramer[s weathered face stayed 
expressionless. "Are you familiar 
with the customs of Indians of, 
say, two hundred years ago?" 

"With their customs, clothing, 
religions, food, taboos, cultures, 
weapons, or anything else you can 
think of." 

Franklin McClave, the Secre- 
tary of War, cut in on us at this 
point. "I think, Bob," he said to 
Kramer, "that Mr. Quinlan quali- 
fies for the job." His glanced 
turned to me. "I'd like for you to 
meet a man waiting in the next 
room, Quinlan. I want you to 
hear his story, talk to him, ask 
him questions, then give us your 
opinion of the results. Do you 
mind?" 

I spread my hands. "Whatever 
you say." 

Kramer got to his feet and went 
over to a side door. He pushed it 
open, said something I didn't 
hear, then stepped rather quickly 
out of the way. 

A moment later young Daniel 
Boone came out! 

Of course, it wasn't really Dan- 
iel Boon at all. Leaving out the 
fact that the "dark and bloody 
ground" frontiersman had been 
dead nearly a hundred and fifty 
years, this man was a lot hand- 



96 



 



somer, with entirely different 
features. But he was wearing the 
fringed buckskin trousers and 
shirt, the beaded moccasins, the 
coonskin cap, and his coarse 
black hair hung almost to his 
shoulders. A powderhorn swung 
from his neck by a greasy cord, 
and he was holding on to a six- 
foot muzzle-loader as though it 
were his only contact with reality. 

I stood there with my chin two 
inches from the rug and gawked 
at him. He was scared to death. 
His deep-set brown eyes rolled 
fearfully from side to side, with 
too much white showing around 
the irises. His clutch on the gun 
grew even tighter, whitening the 
knuckles of his hand. 

Muscles crawled on my scalp. 
A strange tension seemed to fill 
the room. Kramer cleared his 
throat. "This man's name is 
Enoch Wetzel, Mr. Quinlan. I 
want him to tell you exactly what 
he told us earlier tonight." 

I felt the tendons in my legs 
tighten, pulling me into a slight 
crouch. I was back a hundred and 
seventy years in the past, with a 
dull anger starting to move around 
in me. "Wetzel," I said, making 
it sound like a dirty word. "Any 
relation to Lewis Wetzel?" 

The young man's eye.s widened 
with astonishment and obvious 
relief. "Well, now, I reckon so! 
Lew's my uncle." 

"Lew Wetzel," I said between 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



my teeth, "is a low, stinking, 
murdering skunk!" 

I ducked just in time to keep 
from being brained by the swing- 
ing stock of the long gun. I came 
up under it quicker than I'd ever 
moved before in my life and 
nailed him on the jaw with a solid 
right, getting my shoulder behind 
it. It was like hitting the Hall of 
Justice. He grunted and up came 
the rifle butt for another try. 

Suddenly the room was bulging 
with strangers. A dozen arms 
folded around the young man, the 
gun was ripped from his fingers 
and he hit the rug with a thump 
that shook the room. The buck- 
skin-covered legs threshed briefly, 
then were still. 

I moistened my lips and backed 
away as sanity returned. I looked 
at the frozen faces around the 
table. "My fault, Mr. President. 
I can't blame you for thinking I'm 
as crazy as he is. But, as Mr. 
Kramer mentioned, I'm part In- 
dian. Back in the seventeen hun- 
dreds a frontiersman named Lewis 
Wetzel murdered a lot of Indians 
— men, women and children. I 
suppose you might say I went ata- 
vistic, or something, at hearing 
this fellow claim he was Wetzel's 
nephew. He's a screwball, of 
course, and I owe you a good 
solid apology for starting a ruckus." 

The President wasn't smiling 
now. "Perhaps I should have told 
you before, Mr. Quinlan, we may 
desperately need this young man's 

97 



assistance in the near future." 

I almost blurted out the wrong 
thing, but bit my lip instead and 
remained silent. The President's 
eyes swung to the heap of hu- 
manity on the floor. "Let him up, 
boys. I'll call you if I need you 
again." 

The six Secret Service men rose 
and stood Enoch Wetzel on his 
feet, then returned to the adjoin- 
ing office, not looking too happy 
about leaving a madman with the 
Chief Executive. Wetzel pushed 
the long hair off his forehead 
and stood there glowering at me, 
spots of angry color in his dark 
cheeks. 

I said, "Forget it, Mac. I made 
a small mistake." 

His thin lips peeled back in a 
snarl. "Half breed!" 

I took it, although nothing was 
ever harder for me to do. Kramer 
hurriedly stepped into the breach. 
"Mr. — ah — Wetzel, we're wait- 
ing for you to repeat what you 
told us before." 

The tall, broad-shouldered 
young man turned from me to face 
the long table. There was a grace- 
ful dignity about him, in his 
posture, in the way he held his 
head, that you don't see often. 
Again I felt the hair move along 
my scalp. For a guy who was as 
nutty as peanut brittle, he was 
certainly convincing in his role 
of frontiersman. Turn back the 
clock far enough and this could 
have been one of General An- 



thony Wayne's scouts at the bat- 
tle of Fallen Timbers. He even 
swelled the part. 

"My father got hisself put on 
by General Harmer as a scout a 
fortnight back. The General, on 
orders from President Washing- 
ton, was to lead his sojers to the 
north after the Injuns up there. 
Pop allowed as I was ready to 
try my luck agin the abbregynes, 
so he took me along. 

"Three-four nights after we 
set out ahead the rest, Pop an' 
me come onto fresh Injun signs. 
We move powerful careful through 
the woods an' right soon we catch 
sight of camp fires. There's a 
whole grist of them red devils 
prancin' around, all fixed out in 
war paint — more of 'em as I 
ever see'd afore. Even Pop allows 
as how it bugs out his eyes — and 
Pop's a man to do an amount of 
travelin'." 

It was a page torn out of techni- 
color nightmare: three of the 
world's most important men hang- 
ing onto the words of a madman 
who claimed to be an Eighteenth 
Century Indian scout in the em- 
ploy of one of George Washing- 
ton's generals. Yet the man's 
every word, every gesture, every- 
thing he wore, was as authentic to 
that period as the powder horn 
around his neck. 

"We draw back in the woods 
aways an' wait. It's gettin' along 
to'ard sun-up, an' Pop says he 



98 



 



aims to get a better idea how 
many Injuns they is, an' what 
tribes. Most of the braves got nice 
new British guns an' General 
Harmer'll want to know about 
that." 

Wetzel's voice began to shake 
a little, remembering. "Pop an' 
me are hidin' in a clump of sumac 
when this here sudden racket 
starts up, equal to a hundred 
waterfalls goin' all at oncet. We 
look up in the air where it's 
comin' from, and holy hokey if 
fallin' right out of the sky ain't 
this round iron thing! Flat as a 
hoe-cake an' big around as an 
acre of land, with the fires of Hell 
breathin' at its edges! 

"Well sir, them Injuns lit a 
shuck out of there like the spirits 
was after them. My legs were 
tryin' to run, too. But Pop takes 
a holt on my arm an' says, 'By 
Janey, I aim to see this if'en I 
swing for it!' 

"It drops down," Wetzel con- 
tinued, demonstrating with a slow 
graceful movement of his hand, 
"lookin' no less than a big shiny 
stove-lid, an' settles in the clearin' 
as light an' easy as the feather 
off'en a duck's back. It stands 
high as a Pennsylvany school 
house an' twicet the size around, 
an' no sound from it at all." 

He stood slim and straight as a 
Shawnee arrow, smooth-faced and 
solemn, obviously not much past 
his twentieth birthday, yet by 



his own account born before the 
Declaration of Independence was 
on paper. He went on talking, 
sounding like a character out of 
James Fenimore Cooper. His story, 
boiled down and translated, came 
out something like this: 

The sudden arrival of the strange 
object had literally paralyzed the 
Indian encampment. The war- 
riors dropped their weapons and 
called on the spirits to protect 
them, while a hole opened in the 
side of what couldn't be anything 
else but a spaceship. Then out 
of the opening came huge steel 
caricatures of men. There were 
over a dozen of these robots, each 
the height of two men, and their 
eyes were strange round circles of 
faceted glass. In single file they 
moved down the ramp and stalked 
through the ranks of fear-frozen 
Indians, disappearing into the 
forest. 

Enoch's father ordered his son 
to crawl up into a tree out of 
sight, then shouldered his rifle 
and slipped away through the 
bushes to get a better look at 
what was going on. Enoch "al- 
lowed" that his Pop was a 
"moughty" brave man, and none 
of his audience gave him an 
argument on that score. 

From his place among the 
leaves, Enoch watched his father 
melt into the trees. The sun was 
above the horizon by this time 
and the young frontiersman dis- 
covered that his present position 



CALL HIM SAVAGE 



99 



was the equivalent of a box seat 
on the fifty-yard line. 

The next figure to emerge from 
the spaceship brought an amazed 
murmur from hundreds of throats. 
No twelve-foot robot this time, 
no alien monster beyond descrip- 
tion. Very simply,' this was an 
Indian. 

Yet what an Indian! He stood 
on the ramp, wearing only leather 
breeches and unadorned mocca- 
sins, muscles rippling across a 
powerful sun-tanned chest, his 
head thrown back in a posture of 
arrogant dignity. He wore a single 
crimson feather in his black top- 
knot, and at his belt was a toma- 
hawk only slightly less deadly 
looking than a howitzer. 

Arms folded across his chest, 
he swept his stunned audience 
with an eye like an eagle's, then 
began to speak. His voice, deep 
and ringing, carried beyond the 
edges of the crowd, so that Enoch 
was able to catch a portion of 
what he was saying. 

Wetzel admitted he understood 
very little of any of the Indian 
tongues. He thought the one he 
was hearing had its roots in the 
Delaware tribe, but admitted this 
was no more than a guess. How- 
ever, it appeared that the visitor 
was summoning the chiefs of the 
assembled tribes to a meeting 
within the spaceship. 

Evidently it took some doing. 
Faced with a familiar danger, 

100 



there is no human more coura- 
geous than an Indian. But the 
thought of entering the yawning 
maw of that steel cavern would 
have shaken the nerves of Mana- 
bus himself. 

Finally the visiting Indian's 
oratory paid off, and nine or ten 
of the tribal leaders reluctantly 
entered the spaceship. Two robots 
took up positions on the ramp to 
discourage kibitzers, and after 
an hour or so in which nothing 
more happened, the rest of the 
camp returned pretty much to 
normal. 

Mid-afternoon came and passed, 
and still the meeting inside the 
ship went on. Enoch was finding 
the tree branch not the most 
comfortable place to spend a 
weekend, and he was growing 
steadily more uneasy by his fa- 
ther's continued absence. 

More hours passed. The sun 
was gone now and campfires be- 
gan to dot the night. Orders or no 
orders, Enoch decided, he was 
going to find his Pop. With a 
stealth equal to that of any In- 
dian, he dropped to the ground 
and began a cautious advance in 
the direction his father had taken 
hours before. 

Suddenly the bushes crashed 
apart directly in front of him, and 
his father came bounding through. 
Only a few yards back, its giant 
strides rapidly closing the gap, 
came one of the huge steel men. 
Enoch's gun flashed up and he 

 



fired without aiming. The bullet 
struck one of the robot's huge 
eyes, shattering the glass and 
sending the towering figure crash- 
ing headlong into a tree. At the 
same instant, an ear-shattering 
wail came from the fallen robot, 
and powerful rays of light flashed 
from the rim of the spaceship to 
bathe the spot where the two 
Wetzels stood. 

Mixed with the siren wail from 
the fallen man of steel came a 
chorus of blood-curdling warhoops 
as the Indians made out the fig- 
ures of the two men, and a hun- 
dred braves came pouring across 
the clearing toward them. In- 
stantly the two scouts took to 
their heels, darting through the 
inky blackness of the forest with 
the sure-footed celerity of long 
practice. 

They would have escaped easily 
under ordinary circumstances. But 
suddenly the blast of another 
siren sounded directly ahead and 
a lance of light impaled them. 
Blinded, they stumbled aside, 
only to be caught by still another 
beam. 

The two men split apart and 
dived for cover. Enoch, finding 
himself shielded from the rays by 
the thick bole of a tree, scrambled 
into its branches. A moment later 
the first wave of Indians passed 
below him. 

For fully ten minutes he crouched 
there among the leaves. The bar- 
rage of light, he discovered, had 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



come from the towering robots, 
and he recalled the dozen or so 
steel monsters that had left the 
camp soon after the spaceship 
landed. Evidently they had been 
sent out to encircle the camp so 
that no one might leave or enter 
until the visitors permitted it. 

Finally Enoch heard the Indi- 
ans returning toward camp. He 
knew they would search every 
tree hunting for him. Reloading 
his rifle, he dropped to the ground 
and adopting the only maneuver 
they would- not expect, made his 
way cautiously back toward the 
camp. 

He had hoped to skirt the camp 
itself and find an avenue to free- 
dom in the opposite direction. 
But his hopes were almost im- 
mediately dashed, for he soon 
made out the darting rays of 
light marking more of the robots. 

Enoch was trapped. Taking ad- 
vantage of every possible means 
of cover, he inched ahead, chang- 
ing his direction a dozen times, 
until he suddenly stopped short, 
his path barred by the towering 
spaceship itself. Staying within 
the dense shadows at its base, 
he began to skirt the ship, hoping 
to find a place where he could 
hide out until the enemy gave up 
the search. 

But again his luck failed to hold. 
This time he was stopped by a 
wall of metal fully ten feet high, 
which turned out to be one side 

101 



of the entrance ramp to the space- 
ship. Circling it would bring him 
right into the camp, to climb over 
it was impossible; to turn back, 
useless. This was the end of the 
line! 

As he stood there trying to 
figure out his next move, he 
caught the sound of a guarded 
movement some distance behind 
him. Instantly he dropped to the 
grass, his long rifle ready to take 
at least one of his enemies with 
him. And that was when he learned 
that the bottom of the ramp was 
nearly two feet above the ground. 

Even Macy's shopping service 
couldn't have furnished him with 
a better hiding place. Enoch wrig- 
gled himself under the edge and 
lay there breathing quietly, while, 
a moment later, three pairs of 
moccasined feet moved over the 
spot where he had been hiding. 

Some time passed. He could 
hear voices very near and the 
rustle of feet moving through the 
grass. Then came the dull thud of 
metal against metal over his head 
in a rhythmic tempo like the 
tread of marching soldiers. Hardly 
had this ceased before he heard 
another sound which he could not 
identify, and the ramp itself began 
to move! 

It was drawing in toward the 
ship, very slowly. To stay where 
he was would mean the loss of his 
hiding place; to try to run away 
would almost certainly be fatal. 



And so Enoch acted in the only 
way left to him. 

By hooking his arms and legs 
around the girders forming the 
underside of the ramp, he was 
able to lift himself clear of the 
ground. It meant being carried 
into the ship, but even that, he 
decided, -was better than falling 
into the hands of Indians. 

He clung there like a sloth to a 
branch. Fortunately the beams 
were recessed enough to prevent 
his being scraped off when he 
reached the opening into the hull. 
When the ramp finally ground to a 
halt he found himself in darkness 
beyond anything in his experi- 
ence. There was cold metal under 
him now and he lowered himself 
gingerly onto it. When he tried 
to crawl into the open, he discov- 
ered that the edges of the ramp 
were now flush with the floor. 

Suddenly a deep humming note 
tore at his ears, became a shrill 
whine, then passed into silence. 
The floor seemed to press harder 
and harder into his back, his 
lungs fought for air, a sharp burst 
of light seemed to explode sound- 
lessly before his bulging eyes and 
consciousness left him. . . . 

The rasp of metal against metal 
aroused him. The ramp was mov- 
ing again. Once more he attached 
himself to its girders and was 
slowly carried from the spaceship. 
Sunlight on the grass told him the 
night had passed, and the mo- 
ment the ramp came to a halt, he 



102 



 



dropped to the ground and squirmed 
into the open. He was close 
enough to the ship to keep from 
being seen by those aboard, and 
he slipped quickly around one 
side before making a break for the 
shelter of a clump of trees border- 
ing the clearing. 

"And that, Mr. Quinlan," Kra- 
mer said, "just about brings you 
up to date. At 4:07 this afternoon 
Mr. Wetzel was found by the 
crew of an Army tank twelve 
miles west of Burdette, Colorado. 
He told his story to the colonel in 
charge of that perimeter of opera- 
tions, and was then flown directly 
to Washington." He paused and 
allowed himself a humorless smile. 
"I assume you have some ques- 
tions?" 

I said, "I'm not going to ask if 
you take this man's story seri- 
ously. Considering the positions 
of the men in this room you obvi- 
. ously do. What I'd like to know 
is why?" 

Kramer hesitated. "Let me ask 
you this, Quinlan," he said, choos- 
ing his words carefully. "Based 
solely on this man's costume and 
speech, would you say he is an 
impostor? " 

"No," I told him promptly. 
"Frontiersmen dressed exactly 
that way, the long gun is authen- 
tic and his pronunciation, phrases 
and idiom comes straight out of 
pre-Revolutionary times. But I 
still fail to see why you give a 

CALt, HIM SAV/ GE 



second thought to his story." 
"You don't think it true?" 
"My God, man, how can it be? 
Unless you're trying to tell me 
that this character was brought 
here by a time machine!" 

"One moment, Mr. Quinlan." 
Secretary of War McClave was 
back in the picture. "Let me tell 
you why we do not regard Mr. 
Wetzel as a mental case. Shortly 
after one o'clock this afternoon, 
Rocky Mountain Time, a section 
of Washington County, Colorado, 
roughly thirty miles in circum- 
ference was suddenly cut off from 
the rest of the country — cut off 
as completely as though it never 
existed. Telephone lines ceased to 
function, a radio station in the 
same area went off the air in the 
middle of a soap commercial. All 
traffic, vehicular and foot, ceased 
to come out of it. The Governor 
of Colorado sent in a detachment 
of the National Guard; nothing 
has been heard from it since. Air 
observers report all cars and trains 
appear to have stalled. Two planes 
trying a bit of hedge-hopping ap- 
parently conked out and were 
forced to land. No radio contact 
with them." 

I said, "I heard some of this on 
a news broadcast shortly before 
midnight tonight. According to 
the announcer the area involved 
was larger than thirty miles." 

McClave nodded soberly. "The 
affected area is expanding stead- 
ily. It now reaches as far west as 

103 



Strasburg, Colorado, and as far 
east as the Nebraska state line. 
The north and south limits seem 
to be somewhat narrower." 

I looked at him and at the other 
men around the table. Their faces 
held a quiet tautness, and General 
Ohlmsted's hand, holding a cigar, 
was shaking a little. "And," I 
said, "you feel that this space- 
ship holds the answer. Is that it? " 

"It's all we have to go on," 
the President said softly. 

"One more question," I said. 
"Where do I fit into this?" 

There was a moment's awkward 
silence, broken by the creak of 
the chair holding the man who 
had been introduced to me as a 
Mr. Proudfit. His round face 
smiled at me almost jovially. 

"I expect I'm the one to explain 
that, Mr. Quinlan. Wetzel tells 
us the man in charge of the space- 
ship appeared to be an Indian. It 
seems our best move is to send 
an emissary into the blacked-out 
section to learn the reason for this 
• — well — this attack. Such a rep- 
resentative should be qualified to 
deal intelligently with this — this 
Indian. Somebody able to under- 
stand the Indian temperament. 
In short, Mr. Quinlan, you!" 

I rubbed a hand along the back 
of my neck and smiled. "You 
know, this whole thing is utterly 
mad! Indians, time machines, ro- 
bots, spaceships! But then these 
days the most fertile imaginations 



can't seem to keep up with reality. 
If you gentlemen want me to try 
to get to this Indian and ask him 
what's the big idea, I'll do my 
best. Not because I want to, but 
because I wouldn't know how to 
go about -refusing the President 
of my country." 

Some of the tension seemed to 
go out of the room. The President 
said, "You won't find me or your 
country ungrateful, Mr. Quin- 
lan," and the Secretary of War 
nodded approvingly, and General 
Ohlmsted's cigar stopped shaking. 
Proudfit took out a sheaf of pa- 
pers from an inner pocket of his 
coat, leafed through them quickly 
and handed one to me. "This au- 
thorizes you as a representative of 
the United States Government, 
answerable only to the President, 
and with full authority to act 
accordingly." 

"Fine," I said, putting it away. 
"Maybe I can use it on these ro- 
bots Wetzel mentioned!" 

Proudfit looked at his strap- 
watch. "An Army jet bomber will 
take you and Mr. Wetzel to a 
point as close to Burdette, Colo- 
rado, as can be managed. Wetzel 
tells us he can locate the spaceship 
from that point. We don't know, 
of course, how closely guarded 
the ship is — or even if it's 
guarded at all. But Wetzel is con- 
fident his training and back- 
ground as a frontiersman and In- 
dian fighter can get you there un- 
der cover of darkness. Once you 



104 



 



reach the spaceship, the rest is 
up to you." 

"And if I don't make it?" 

Proudfit spread his hands. "Two 
companies of Army regulars en- 
tered that area at 6:30 tonight. 
They were fully armed, with or- 
ders to use those arms if neces- 
sary. Nothing has been heard 
from them since. We're sending 
you on the theory that where 
many can't get through perhaps 
one or two can. You have until 
noon — slightly more than eleven 
hours from now — to get word to 
us. If we don't hear from you by 
then or if the 'dead' area con- 
tinues to expand after that time, 
then we throw our Sunday punch!" 

Enoch Wetzel was still stand- 
ing exactly as he had while telling 
his story. I walked over to him. 
"Let's get one thing straight, mis- 
ter. If you and I are going to work 
together, we leave personal feel- 
ings out of it. A few minutes ago 
I passed a remark" or two about 
one of your relatives and you 
tried to knock my head off. I'm 
willing to forget it if you are. But 
I don't want any more cracks out 
of you about my being a half- 
breed. Is that clear?" 

He eyed me stonily, then with- 
out change of expression spat on 
the rug within a quarter-inch of 
my left shoe. I felt the muscles 
in my arms twang like plucked 
wires as I resisted the impulse to 
swing on him. "Is that your an- 
swer, Wetzel?" 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



"I'll git you thar," he said 
tonelessly. ' ' I promised these yere 
gennelmen I'd do thet much. But it 
don't hold I gotta cotton to you." 

We stood there staring into 
each other's eyes. There was a 
wall of hatred between us that 
could never be destroyed, a wall 
not fashioned by us but by our 
forefathers generations before. Yet 
a chain of incredible events had 
made us allies against an alien 
foe. In spite of our mutual dislike 
we must work together. 

I turned back to Proudfit. "I'll 
need a pair of heavy black basket- 
ball shoes, dark coveralls, a good 
heavy sweater, a .38 Colt auto- 
matic with plenty of ammunition, 
and a compass." 

The bomber pilot was a fresh- 
faced youngster who chewed gum 
and claimed to have been the 
second -ranking tennis player in 
Des Moines, Iowa. He shook 
hands gravely with me, eyed Wet- 
zel and his strange garb and out- 
size rifle with blank-faced wonder, 
and mentioned that it was a nice 
night for flving. 

The plane took off at 1:27. We 
were due over our target by 4:00 
o'clock Eastern Standard Time, 
or 2 :00 Mountain Time. The plans 
called for the bomber to fly at a 
high altitude, then come in on 
Burdette with jets off and drop us 
by 'chute. Wetzel had balked for 
a while at the idea of stepping 

105 



off into space, but a brief but pa- 
tient explanation of how a para- 
chute worked finally brought him 
grudgingly around. 

The trip seemed to take for- 
ever. I was torn by a thousand 
doubts, saddened by not being al- 
lowed to say goodbye to Lois, not 
a little afraid of what I would 
likely run into in Colorado. And 
all the while, my companion, out 
of his normal world and time, sur- 
rounded by wonders beyond his 
wildest nightmares, slept sound as 
an infant. . . . 

A hand shook me awake. In the 
faint glow of a flashlight I made 
out the face of the co-pilot. 
"Twenty minutes, Mr. Quinlan." 

Wetzel was already on his feet. 
The co-pilot helped us don the 
'chutes, and five minutes before 
arrival opened the heavy side 
door. A rush of wind tore in, but 
there was no other sound. The 
jets had already cut off and the 
plane was gradually losing alti- 
tude in a shallow dive. As this was 
not a plane used for parachute 
troops there was no wire to hook 
the 'chute cord to. It meant we 
would have to pull our own, but 
both of us had been thoroughly 
versed in what to do. 

"Get ready," shouted the co- 
pilot. 

I grasped the door frame and 
waited, my heart pounding in my 
ears. Wetzel stood directly behind 
me, the muzzle-loader in his hand, 
the tail of his coonskin cap bounc- 



ing in the wind, his eyes narrowed. 

"Five," the co-pilot said sud- 
denly. "And a four, and a three, 
and a two, and a one — target!" 

I dived headfirst into blackness. 
I spun madly earthward, but in 
the back'of my mind a calm voice 
counted off the seconds. Then I 
yanked at the ring-cord, black 
folds of nylon rustled above me, 
I heard a sharp report like the 
crack of a giant whip, the straps 
at my shoulders yanked painfully, 
and I was floating gently down 
toward the night-shrouded sur- 
face of Colorado. 

I landed in a meadow, if that 
was what they called it this far 
west. I came down hard but in the 
way they had told me would pre- 
vent injury. There was no wind to 
yank me about before I could un- 
ship the parachute, and within 
seconds I was on my feet and 
searching for some sign of Enoch 
Wetzel. 

Unexpectedly a hand struck me 
lightly on the back. I was jumping 
aside and reaching for my gun 
when the frontiersman's quiet 
voice reached me. "You scare 
mighty easy for an Injun." 

I said, "We should be about a 
mile, two at the most, south of the 
road where that Army tank picked 
you up yesterday afternoon. Let's 
find it." 

"Aye." 

The land was by no means as 
flat as I had expected. Fortunately 



106 



 



most of it was relatively open, 
with only scattered clumps of 
trees and bushes. There were too 
many small unexplained night 
sounds, but none of these appeared 
to alarm Wetzel in the slightest, 
so I managed to ignore them. 
Once we flushed a long-eared rab- 
bit, and it was five minutes before 
I could get my heart out of my 
throat. 

A barbed -wire fence, the first 
we had encountered, told me we 
had reached a road. It wasn't 
paved or even graveled — just a 
ribbon of dirt pointing east and 
west as straight as an Apache 
lance. Nothing moved along it in 
either direction as far as 1 could 
see. A line of telephone poles 
bordered one side. 

"Recognize any landmarks?" 
I asked. 

Wetzel shook his head. 

"We're probably east of where 
you were found," I said. "We 
might as well start walking." 

He grunted in agreement and 
we started out. It was a lovely 
starlit night, no moon at this hour, 
and a lot warmer than I had ex- 
pected for October in Colorado. 
Now and then the road dipped 
and climbed, and as we reached 
the crest of the third hill, I saw 
a good -sized farmhouse set well 
back from the road among a group 
of out-buildings. 

I pointed to the house. "Maybe 
they can tell us what's been hap- 
pening around here." 



Wetzel nodded and we turned 
in at a fieldstone path leading 
across the large yard to the front 
door. There were no lights visible 
from within, no dog barked, no 
rustle of livestock in the barns or 
pens. 

I saw him just before I stepped 
on his head. He was lying across 
the path in the shadow cast by a 
gnarled tree, a stocky man in 
overalls arid a blue work shirt. A 
double-barrelled twelve-gauge shot- 
gun lay on the ground near his 
right hand. One side of his chest 
was black with a sticky substance 
that could have been only one 
thing, and the top of his head was 
black in the same way, except that 
no hair was there anymore. . . . 

"Scalped!" I whispered hoarsely. 

Enoch Wetzel stooped sud- 
denly and picked up the shotgun 
and wordlessly held it out to me. 
My jaw fell in astonishment. The 
twin barrels were bent into a rude 
V. 

I licked my lips and backed 
away. "Let's get out of here, 
Wetzel." 

He tossed the gun aside and we 
turned back to the road. Neither 
of us said anything for fully a 
mile. "No human hands could 
have done that to a gun," I said. 
"I'm beginning to believe what 
you said about robots. Robots 
that take scalps!" 

Another hill, another valley 
» . . and Wetzel caught hold of 



CALL HIM SAVAGE 



107/ 



my arm. "I come across them so- 
jers about here," he said. 

"Okay. From now on you act 
as guide." 

We went on. Several times 
Wetzel's long, swinging, tireless 
stride left me behind and he was 
forced to wait until I caught up 
with him again. I had the feeling 
that I was holding him back, and 
there was something faintly con- 
temptuous in his obvious patience. 
But the life of a book-writing 
newspaper man hadn't prepared 
me for cross-country marathons, 
and there was nothing to be done 
about it now. 

The fairly level, open ground 
was giving place to a heavily 
wooded countryside. After an- 
other mile of winding roadway, 
Wetzel suddenly turned aside and 
plunged into the forest. It was as 
dark as the inside of an under- 
taker's hat, and after I had 
banged into a few dozen trees and 
tripped over a few dead branches, 
making enough racket to alert 
half the state, Wetzel slowed his 
pace to a crawl. 

Finally I grabbed one of the 
fringed sleeves of his buckskin 
shirt to stop him and sank down 
on a fallen log. "How much far- 
ther?" 

He leaned his folded arms on 
the muzzle of his long gun and I 
could feel his deep-set eyes study- 
ing me without approval. '"Nother 
hour; p'rhaps more. Dependin' 
on you." 

108 



"Sure," I said with understand- 
able bitterness. "I'm not the man 
my granddaddy was. Nobody is. 
When I take a walk it's down to 
the corner for a pack of cigarettes. 
Anything farther than that I use 
a horseless carriage. We don't 
need steel muscles and superior 
woodcraft these days, brother. 
Just enough eyesight to read the 
directions on the can, ears sharp 
enough to hear the boss bawling 
you out, enough nose to smell 
the whiskey on your neighboring 
straphanger's breath, reflexes quick 
enough to avoid being run down 
by some politician's Cadillac. If 
I 'd have known I was going to be 
called on to go batting around a 
jungle, I'd have been down to the 
Y five days a we — " 

He moved like a striking snake. 
A hand was clapped over my 
mouth and a knee forced me to 
the ground. Before I could make 
an effort to fight back, he placed 
his mouth close to my ear. "Dan- 
ger! Tis death for so much as a 
broken twig!" 

He removed his hand and I 
could breathe again. We lay there 
side by side close to a huge tree, 
deep in the shadows. And then 
faintly as from far off I heard the 
crackle of disturbed undergrowth 
and, slowly louder and louder, an 
evenly spaced thumping sound 
that seemed to shake the earth. 

Through the trees it came, di- 
rectly toward the spot where Wet- 
zel and I hugged the ground. It 

 



loomed against the night, a tower 
of steel on jointed legs, a horrible 
travesty of the human figure, a 
head like King Arthur's helmet. 
Starlight picked out two round 
faceted eyes of glass. 

My suddenly dry mouth puck- 
ered with the taste of terror. I did 
not breathe; even my heart seemed 
to beat no more. I wanted to close 
my eyes, but even the lids seemed 
paralyzed. 

_ For almost a full minute the 
giant robot remained standing less 
than ten feet from where Wetzel 
and I were lying. It seemed to 
sense the presence of something 
of flesh and blood nearby. Its 
head turned slowly from side to 
side in little uneven jerks that 
put ice cubes in my veins. Finally 
the mammoth feet began their 
rhythmic thumping and a moment 
later it disappeared among the 
trees. 

After what seemed a long time 
Wetzel rose to his feet. I got up 
slowly and leaned against the 
tree. "In a little while," I said 
softly, "I'll wake up. I'll be in 
bed with my wife, under the nice 
clean white sheets, and I'll know 
all this was a nightmare brought 
on by that canned salmon we had 
for dinner." 

This, I told myself sharply, 
wasn't getting me anywhere ex- 
cept next door to hysteria. I 
ground my teeth together, shud- 
dered uncontrollably for a second 



or two, then was all right again. 
Or nearly so. 

"Let's go," I said. 
An hour or so later, after taking 
a twisting route through what 
seemed to be the Belgian Congo, 
Wetzel halted under the spreading 
branches of a towering cotton- 
wood. With his lips close to my 
ear, he whispered, "It's a-settin' 
out thar midst open ground." He 
gestured at the wall of blackness 
hemming us in — blackness you 
could have cut into hunks with an 
ax. "I'm thinkin' thar's plenty 'o 
them iron critters roamin' 'round 
twixt us an' it. You aimin' to 
await the dawn?" 

"You," I said, "said it!" 

The dawn came up nice and 
quiet. Blackness turned gray and 
then a pearl pink — and there she 
was: a hundred yards from us, of 
some gleaming metal resembling 
aluminum, twenty feet high and 
covering about as much ground 
as a caretaker's cottage. It re- 
sembled nothing more than a soup 
plate turned bottom up to dry. 

A tall, semi-circular opening 
showed black in one side, with a 
sloping metallic ramp reaching 
from it to the ground. Two robots 
guarded the entrance, stiff and 
towering and without movement, 
the early light glistening along 
their jointed bodies. 

In sharp contrast to this scene 
from the distant future was the 
anachronistic spectacle of six In- 



CALL HIM SAVAGE 



109 



dians, in war paint, fringed buck- 
skin and stripped to the waist, 
squatting around a small cooking 
fire near the ship. Within easy 
reach of each was a long bow and 
a quiver of arrows. 

Nothing about them gave me 
a certain clue as to which Indian 
family they belonged to. The sin- 
gle feather in each scalp lock was 
pure white with a vivid red tip. 
Two of them wore the black paint 
of untried warriors, and all were 
gnawing on strips of meat' grilled 
over the fire. 

Wetzel, placid and silent, leaned 
on his rifle and calmly stuffed a 
cheek with a twist of black to- 
bacco. "Reckon they be a little 
hard to talk to?" he asked in a 
soft voice. 

I shrugged. "Only one way I 
know of to find out." 

"Thet fancy pistol you got 
could kill 'em all afore they get 
them bows unlimbered." 

"Are you suggesting I shoot 
them down without warning?" 

It was his turn to shrug. "They 
be Indians." 

The complete lack of feeling in 
his tone infuriated, me "You 
cold-blooded bastard! I happen 
to be a good part Indian myself." 

He eyed me without expression 
but with a chill glitter to his eyes. 
"Aye. I ain't forgettin' thet," he 
said, and spat. 

I took a slow breath and waited 
until I could trust my voice. "I'm 
going out there," I said quietly. 



"Cover me with your gun. But 
don't use it unless it's the only 
thing left to do. I don't want that 
trigger pulled until the last pos- 
sible second. They may grab me, 
they may even knock me around 
a little.- That I can take. But 
don't try to interfere until there's 
no other way out. Is that clear?" 
"Aye." 

I turned away from him. All I 
had to do now was step out from 
behind that tree and walk across 
the open ground. Each of my feet 
suddenly weighed a ton. Two 
steps into that clearing and the 
funeral could be Monday. In- 
stinctively my hand crawled to- 
ward the .38 automatic hidden in 
my coveralls. It never got that 
far. Suicide was so final. 

Wetzel's firm young mouth 
held an almost invisible sneer. 
Deliberately I took out a ciga- 
rette, lighted it with an airy 
gesture and a match, dragged 
deeply on it twice and threw it 
away. I said, "Lay off that gun 
like I told you," and walked 
slowly out into the clearing. 

It got a rise out of them, all 
right. They were on their feet, 
arrows notched, before I had 
traveled three feet. I never even 
hesitated. Once I had gone this 
far, the bluff had to be carried all 
the way out. I kept my spine stiff, 
my head erect, my hands con- 
spicuously empty at my sides. If 
my nerves were jumping I was 



110 



 



the only one who knew about it. 

It caught them just a shade off- 
balance, which was all I had 
hoped for. The one-sidedness of 
six drawn bows against one un- 
impressive and unarmed man 
eventually registered and the 
flint tips wavered, then turned 
aside. 

The tallest of the braves — a 
lean number the color of an old 
penny — ■ tossed his bow aside and 
deliberately stepped squarely in 
my path. There was an insolent 
arrogance in every line of his 
body — a body that topped my 
six feet a full three inches. 

I said, "Hi-yo, Silver," and put 
my hip into his naked belly and 
grabbed his arm and threw him 
over my shoulder. He hit face 
first two yards away and plowed 
up a furrow of grass, flopped 
around a little, then lay still. 

Nobody else moved, except me. 
I started for the spaceship again, 
not hurrying and not crawling, 
head still up, spine still stiff, eyes 
straight ahead. Feet slithered in 
the grass behind me and the sound 
made the skin between my shoul- 
der blades twitch like an aching 
tooth. Every instinct that had 
anything to do with self-preserva- 
tion was fighting to make me turn 
around. 

That was when the robots 
moved. They seemed to come 
alive at the same instant, metal 
clanged on metal as they strode 
stiffly down the ramp to meet 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



me. Violence hung over them as it 
hangs over a Patton tank. 

Every step toward them was 
like pulling my foot out of quick- 
sand. Only twelve kinds of a 
cretin would have gone on when 
faced with anything like this. I 
went on. I couldn't do anything 
else. Once you show an Indian a 
molecule of cowardice, you're 
twelve lines on the obituary page. 

The space between us was down 
to a narrow ribbon of grass by 
this time. Four — three more 
steps and I would have to stop. 
Nobody could push aside a couple 
of tons of animated steel. Metal 
arms were lifting slowly, prepar- 
ing to close on me. Inside me a 
silent voice screamed a prayer 
for Wetzel to pull that trigger 
and pump a bullet into one of 
those round, staring, faceted 
eyes. . . . 

The robots seemed to go dead. 
They hung there motionless, arms 
lifted, each with a massive foot 
caught in midstride. 

What had stopped them at the 
last possible second I had no way 
of telling. All I did know was a 
sudden release of tension that 
left me with just enough strength 
to keep my feet moving. 

I went on. 

The edge of the ramp was get- 
ting uncomfortably close. I was 
here to see the head man, but I 
would prefer to see him out in the 
open. The thought of walking 

111 



into that black hole left me as 
cold as a barefoot Eskimo. 

The ramp. It was a good six 
feet wide, made of what seemed 
to be some form of an aluminum 
alloy, and was waiting to be 
walked on. I started up its shallow 
slope, the rubber soles of my 
basketball shoes soundless on the 
smooth surface. 

He appeared suddenly, without 
warning, in the doorway. He was 
quite tall, si im in the hips, and 
his naked shoulders seemed al- 
most as wide as the opening. 
Elaborate beadwork designs had 
been worked into the buckskin 
breeches, and his headdress re- 
sembled a Sioux warbonnet, its 
twin rows of red-tipped feathers 
hanging almost to his moccasins. 
A hunting knife hung in a snake- 
skin sheath at his right hip. He 
was as gauntly handsome as a 
Blackfoot — and they don't come 
any better-looking than that. 

He stood there, arms folded 
across his chest, looking as im- 
movable as Pike's Peak. This time 
I stopped. My back was as stiff 
as his, my head as erect, my 
shoulders as square if not as 
wide. For a long time we stood 
that way staring straight into 
each other's eyes, our expressions 
blank, our tongues locked. 

When enough time had passed 
for me to open the conversation 
without being accused of impetu- 
ousness, I said, "I am Long 
Rock, of the Potawatomi. I have 



come in peace, to hold counsel 
with you." 

My words, in the language of 
the Delaware because of Wetzel's 
earlier remark, had no immediate 
effect, which was par for the 
course with any Indian. Not even 
his eyelids moved. The silence 
went on, building into tension. 
Anyone unfamiliar with the ways 
of the Indian would have taken 
another stab at it. I knew better. 
I had made my pitch; now it was 
strictly up to him. 

Finally his strong lips came un- 
stuck. "I am Lo-as-ro, War Chief 
of the Kornesh." It was the 
Delaware tongue, all right, but 
with inflexions and nuances 
strange to me. "How is it that 
your skin is white but you speak 
in the way of the Orbiwah?" 

That last word, I judged, was 
what the Indian in general was 
called wherever this speciman 
had come from. I said, "In my 
blood is the blood of the Orbiwah. 
That is why I am here, sent by 
the Great Chief of all white 
men." 

We squatted down facing each 
other on the ramp. At once a 
young brave brought out a long, 
elaborately carved peace-pipe. 
Lo-as-ro put the bit to his mouth 
and puffed smoke toward the four 
cardinal points of the compass, 
then passed the pipe to me. The 
tobacco was far more aromatic 
than any I had come across be- 
fore. 



112 



 



With the amenities out of the 
way, the Chief said, "Why has 
the White Chief sent you to me?" 

"To welcome you to the land of 
the white man." 

"1 come not to the land of the 
white man in peace." 

My eyes were as cold as his 
own. "This we do not under- 
stand. The white man has no 
quarrel with the tribe of Kor- 
nesh." 

"The white man," Lo-as-ro 
said sonorously, "has taken from 
the Orbiwah his land and his 
home. He has driven the Orbiwah 
into small areas. He has killed 
buffalo and the bison and the 
deer, leaving the Orbiwah to eat 
the meat of the horse or to starve. 
The Orbiwah has been made foul 
with the diseases of the white 
man." 

"All this," I said, "was long, 
long ago. Perhaps it was not 
right, but it is the way of life that 
the strong prevail and the weak 
perish." 

His expression darkened. "You 
say this — you with the blood of 
the Orbiwah in your veins?" 

"I speak only true words, noble 
Lo -as-ro. The white men are in 
number as the leaves of the 
forest, the Orbiwah few and help- 
less." 

One of his hands made a grace- 
ful motion. "I have come to re- 
turn the land to the Orbiwah, to 
restore him to. the greatness of his 
fathers. Once more the land shall 



be alive with game, the rivers 
filled with fish. Once more shall 
the Orbiwah hunt with the weap- 
ons of his fathers. I have spoken." 

"From whence do you come?" 
I asked. 

He pointed dramatically to- 
ward the sky. "From a great 
distance. Up there are many 
worlds." 

"Tell me of your world," I said. 

The telling took a long time but 
not a word of it was dull. Accord- 
ing to Lo-as-ro, his world was a 
planet revolving about one of the 
stars in the Big Dipper. It was 
slightly smaller than Earth, with 
about the same climates and de- 
velopment of life. It was peopled 
with only one race, the Orbiwah, 
who lived much as the Indians in 
America did before the arrival of 
the white man. Recently space- 
ships from another planet in the 
same solar system had landed on 
the Orbiwah world. These new- 
comers were friendly, had no 
thought of conquest, and pos- 
sessed a science and culture of 
amazing proportions. 

From them the Orbiwah learned 
of a planet on which were men of 
their own kind. Lo-as-ro, fired by 
the thought of establishing con- 
tact with people like himself, had 
borrowed spaceships manned by 
robots and crossed the void to 
Earth. For weeks they had hov- 
ered in our atmosphere, at first 
saddened, then angered, by the 



CALL HIM SAVAGE 



113 



fate meted out to the Indians. 

Since the spaceships were able 
to move through Time into the 
past, Lo-as-ro hit on the idea of 
going back to the days when the 
Indian was still in control of most 
of America. With the power at 
his control he could force the 
white man from the continent 
and restore the land to those who 
owned it. 

Arriving near the close of the 
Eighteenth Century, he found a 
sizeable encampment of Indians, 
brought the ship down among 
them, and summoned the chiefs 
to a Council of War, where he 
outlined to them his plan. To 
his astonishment he found the 
chiefs suspicious of outside help 
and confident that they could 
defeat the white man alone. In 
vain did Lo-as-ro explain that 
they were doomed; they could 
not, or would not, believe that he 
had visited the future. He offered 
to take them ahead and let them 
see for themselves — an offer that 
was quickly refused. 

Whereupon Lo-as-ro decided to 
return to the Present and wrest 
the land from the white man and 
hand it over to the downtrodden 
remnants of a once-powerful race. 
It was on that return trip that 
Wetzel had arrived in the present 
century. 

When Lo-as-ro finished, I leaned 
back against the side of the ship 
and lit a cigarette, bringing a 
startled grunt from the chief. I 

114 



said, "You cannot defeat the 
white man, Lo-as-ro. He has 
weapons such as you have never 
dreamed : machines that can throw 
things that explode and kill hun- 
dreds of braves at one time, 
machines that travel through the 
air as does the one you came in, 
things that can wipe out all life 
within a circle as wide as a brave 
can ride around in one day on a 
fast horse. 

"No, noble Lo-as-ro. Return to 
your world and leave this one to 
the white man. He took it long 
ago and he will never give it up. 
I have spoken." 

The chief of the Orbiwah smiled 
grimly. "In the ship in which I 
arrived on your world is a small 
machine. It is working for me 
now. Within its reach no weapon 
is useful, no explosion can take 
place, no signal can be sent. Only 
Man is not touched by this 
machine, but when it works he 
has no weapons with which to 
fight. Each hour the influence of 
this machine widens. Soon all 
this land will be helpless. Then 
the robots will take charge and 
those who oppose them will be 
slain." 

I thought of the "dead spot" 
I had first heard about on the 
newscast the night before, and 
how it was steadily growing. I 
remembered the slain farmer with 
the missing scalp, the two com- 
panies of soldiers helpless without 
radio, guns and transportation. 

 



I thought of a mechanized Amer- 
ica helpless before a few score of 
these spaceships . . . and I knew 
that counter-violence would be 
useless. 

"Give the country back to the 
Indians!" The cry of the over- 
burdened citizen. It seemed it was 
about to come to that ! 

For a long time I sat there, 
thinking, trying to hit on an 
answer that would save my coun- 
try. And when the answer finally 
stirred at the back of my mind, it 
was so completely bizarre that I 
almost missed it entirely. . . . 

"Noble Lo-as-ro," I said, "I 
must return to the Great White 
Father and tell him what I have 
learned. I will tell him that there 
is nothing to be done to oppose the 
Chief of the Kornesh. Within a few 
hours I will return with his reply." 

Lo-as-ro inclined his fine head 
in assent. "Let it be so." 

"Until my return," I said, "let 
the influence of the machine draw 
back until it holds helpless only 
a small section of land about your 
ship. Only in this way will I be 
able to return quickly to the 
White Chief." 

Again Lo-as-ro agreed. I took 
my leave of him ceremoniously, 
and a few minutes later Wetzel 
and I were hurrying back toward 
the highway. 

Four hours later I was on my 
way back, this time with four 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



companions. The plane landed us 
at the edge of the newly set 
"dead spot" and the five of us 
forced our way through the for- 
est until we reached the clear- 
ing where the spaceship still 
crouched. 

A silent group of Indians 
watched us as we crossed the open 
ground. This time the two robots 
flanking the doorway did not 
leave their posts. As I came up 
the ramp with my companions, 
Lo-as-ro appeared in the doorway 
of the ship. 

He eyed me and the others 
without expression. I said, "Noble 
Lo-as-ro, I have brought with me 
four of my world's Orbiwah. They 
have come to hear your plan for 
them and their people. I have told 
them nothing of what you said to 
me, only that you have come 
from another world and are of 
their blood." 

One by one I presented my 
companions. Yellow Arm was 
Johnny Armin, an old school 
friend Of mine; Iron Eagle, with 
whom I had spent a year in 
Korea, had his telephone listed 
under the name of Luke Riegel; 
Strong Wind was Sidney Storm, 
whom I had met while spending 
a year in Southern California; and 
Lone Pine, known as Lionel Pat- 
terson, lived a few doors down the 
street from me in Washington 
and shot eighteen holes any day 
in the low seventies. 

The color of their skins, the 

115 



unmistakable cast of their fea- 
tures, made up the only passport 
they needed. At the chief's invi- 
tation we squatted in a rude 
circle at the top of the ramp, and 
the peace-pipe was brought out 
and passed around. 

Presently Lo-as-ro began to 
speak. The magnificent voice 
rolled out in tones like a cathedral 
organ, explaining how the Ameri- 
can Indian was to assume his 
rightful place in a world of his 
own. It was a vivid picture, 
painted by an orator equal to any 
of the almost legendary Indian 
speakers, and they don't come 
any better. 

Unfortunately I was the only 
one present who could understand 
him. 

When it was over and Lo-as-ro 
was smiling in confident expec- 
tation of their gratified excite- 
ment, Johnny Armin gave me a 
baffled glance. "What the hell 
was that all about, Sam?" 

I said, "You guys don't know 
how lucky you are. The chief, here, 
is going to fix it up for you to go 
back to the good old days. Be 
noble red men. No more taxes, 
no more taxis. Live out in the 
fresh air, sleep under the star- 
studded sky, drink the unchlori- 
nated spring water." 

" What!" 

' ' You heard me. And he can do 
it, too. He's got the tools to 
flatten the country." 



They stared at me and at each 
other, horror and anger hardening 
their faces. Lo-as-ro had stopped 
smiling and was glancing about 
the circle in obvious bewilder- 
ment. 

"You mean he's doing all that 
for us?" Storm demanded. 

"For all Indians," I said. "Free 
them from the iron heel of the 
oppressor, and all that." 

"Nuts, brother!" Iron Eagle 
snapped. "Tell him I'm a gradu- 
ate of Carnegie Tech, make 
twenty-five grand a year with 
Standard Oil, and vote the Re- 
publican ticket. If he thinks for 
a goddam minute I'm going to 
chasing around on a pinto pony 
hunting buffalo, he's got rocks in 
his head!" 

"And that goes for me — dou- 
ble!" Lone Pine growled. "I 
never heard anything so screwy!" 

I repeated what they had said, 
putting it into words Lo-as-ro 
could understand. He had the 
look of a man who couldn't believe 
his ears. "They speak with stupid 
tongues," he cried. "Do they 
deny the blood of their fathers?" 

"They live as they want to 
live, noble chief," I said. "They 
are grateful for your wish to help 
but they ask me to decline the 
offer." 

He came to his feet with a 
bound, his lean face hardening 
into a copper mask of anger. 
"These are not true Orbiwah!" 
he thundered. "These are as 



116 



 



women, soft with idleness and 
pleasure, weakened by their white 
conquerors. The land is not for 
them ; it is for those forced to live 
in degradation and squalor, dying 
of hunger and disease, ignored by 
the white chiefs. It is they who 
shall be given back the ways of 
their fathers, that they may 
become a great Orbiwah nation 
once more. I have spoken!" 

"Look at these braves," I said. 
All of us were standing now. "Of 
all the Orbiwah in this world it is 
such as these who could hope to 
survive under the conditions you 
wish to establish. The Orbiwah 
you describe would starve amid a 
thousand buffalo, they would fall 
from their horses, they would flee 
in battle. Take away the protec- 
tion of the white chiefs and they 
would die." 

The chief of the tribe of Kor- 
nesh curled his lips in a sneer. 
"The protection given by the 
white chiefs is the protection of 
death. They do not care what 
happens to the Orbiwah. I have 
seen it with my own eyes." 

"You're right," I said promptly. 
"The Orbiwah has been badly 
treated too long. I shall return to 
the Great White Chief and tell 
him this: unless the life of the 
Orbiwah is made good, unless he 
has fine shelter, plenty of food, 
warm clothes for his back and the 
right to be as other men, you will 
return and force the white man 

CALL HIM SAVAGE 



from this land. It will take much 
time, but it shall come to pass. / 
have spoken." 

Doubt flickered in his eyes. 
"Perhaps your words are empty. 
How do I know they are true?" 

"When twenty summers have 
passed," I said, "come back 
again. Look upon the Orbiwah 
and learn if they still suffer want 
and privation. If their life is not 
better for what has happened 
today, then you need never trust 
the white man again." 

For a long moment he stood 
stiff as steel, staring into my eyes. 
Then his hand shot up, palm out, 
in a gesture of farewell, and he 
turned and disappeared into the 
spaceship. 

I got a barrage of questions 
then. I held up a hand to quiet 
my friends. "Some other time, 
gentlemen. I've got to get to 
Washington just as fast as a jet 
plane can get me there." 

"If it's that urgent," Luke 
said, "call him on the phone and 
reverse the charges." 

I scowled at him. "Call who?" 

"The President. Isn't he the 
reason you're in such a hurry?" 

"No! I've got to get to bed." 

"Bed? If you're that tired—" 

"Who said anything about be- 
ing tired?" I demanded. "Being 
tired has nothing to do with it." 

"Then what — " 

"It seems," I said, "there's a 
black dace nightgown . . ."

THE 



CUCKOO 
CLOCK 



BY WESLEY BAREFOOT 



You know a murderer prays on your household — lives 
•with you — depends on you — and you have no defence! 



Death wore the seeming of a 
battered Chevrolet. 
The child's scream and the 
screech of rubber on concrete 
knifed through two seconds of 
time before snapping, like a celery 
stalk of sound, into aching silence. 
The silence of limbo, called into 
being for the space of a slow 
heartbeat. Then the thud of run- 
ning feet, the rising hubbub of 
many voices. 
"Give her air!" 

"Keep back. Don't try to move 
her." 

"Somebody call an ambulance." 

"Yeah, and somebody call a 
cop, too." 

"1 couldn't help it." It was the 
driver of the ramshackle Chevvie. 
"She fell off the curb right in 
front of me. Honest to God, it 
wasn't my fault." 

"Got to report these things 
right away," said the grey haired 
man beside him. "No cause to 



worry if you ain't to blame." 

"Probably no brakes," said a 
heavily accented voice, and an- 
other spoke as if on cue, "Prob- 
ably no insurance, neither." 

"Let me through ! Oh, please — " 
The woman's voice was on the 
edge of hysteria. She came through 
the crowd like an automaton, not 
seeing the people she shoved and 
elbowed aside. 

"D.O.A.," said the woman 
heavily. Her face was no longer 
twisted with shock, and she was 
almost pretty again. "D.O.A. 
Dead on arrival, it means. Oh 
Jim, I never knew they said that." 
Suddenly there were tears in her 
blue eyes. There had been many 
tears, now. 

"Take it easy, Jean honey." 
Jim Blair hoisted his lank six feet 
out of the old rocker, and crossed 
the room, running a nervous hand 
through his cornshock hair. She's 



118 



only thirty, he thought, and I'm 
three years older. That's awfully 
young to have bred three kids and 
lost them. He took her in his arms. 
"I know how tough it is. It's bad 
enough for me, and probably 
worse for you. But at least we're 
sure they'll never be bomb fodder. 
And we still have Joanna." 

She twisted away from him, her 
voice suddenly bitter. "Don't 
give me that Pollyanna stuff, Jim. 
'Goody, goody, only a broken leg. 
It might have been your back.' 
There's no use trying to white- 
wash it. Our kids, our own kids, 
all gone. Dead." She began to sob. 
"I wish I were, too." 
"Jean, Jean — " 
"I don't care. I mean it. Every- 
thing bad has happened since 
Joanna came to live with us." 

"Darling, you can't blame the 
child for a series of accidents." 

"I know." She raised her tear- 
stained face. "But after all — 
Michael, drowned. Then Steve, 
falling off the water tower. Now 
it's Marian." Her fingers gripped 
his arm tightly. "Jim, each of 
them was playing alone with 
Joanna when it happened." 

"Accidents, just accidents," he 
said. It wasn't like Jean, this talk. 
Almost — His mind shied away 
from the word, and circled back. 
Almost paranoid. But Jean was 
stable, rational, always had been. 
Still, maybe a little chat with 
Doctor Holland would be a good 

120 



idea. Breakdowns do happen." 

They both turned at the slam- 
ming of the screen door. Then 
came the patter of childish feet on 
the kitchen linoleum, and Joanna 
burst into the room. 

"Mommy, I want to play with 
Marian. Why can't I play with 
Marian?" 

Jean put her arm around the 
girl's thin shoulder. "Darling, 
you won't be able to play with 
Marian for — quite a while. You 
mustn't worry about it now." 

"Mommy, she looked just like 
she was asleep, then they came and 
took her away." Her lips trem- 
bled. "I'm frightened, Mommy." 

Jim looked down at the dark 
eyes, misted now, the straight 
brown hair, and the little snub 
nose with its dusting of freckles. 
She's all we have left, poor kid, and 
riot even ours, really. Helen's baby. 

He looked up as the battered 
cuckoo clock on the mantel clicked 
warningly. "Time for little girls 
to be in bed, Joanna. Run along 
now like a good girl, and get 
washed." Even as he spoke .the 
miniature doors flew open and the 
caricature of a bird popped out, 
shrilly announcing the hour. It 
cuckooed eight times, then bounced 
back inside. Joanna watched en- 
tranced. 

"Bed time, darling," said Jean 
gently. "School tomorrow, re- 
member? And don't forget to 
brush your teeth." 

 



"I won't. Goodnight mommy, 
goodnight daddy." She turned up 
her face to be kissed, smiled at 
them, and was gone. They listened 
to her footsteps on the stairs. 

"Jim, I'm sorry about the 
things I said." Jean's voice was 
hesitant, a little ashamed. "It is 
hard, though, you know it is — 
Jim, aren't you listening? After 
all, you don't have to watch the 
clock now." Her smile was as 
. labored as the joke. 

He smiled back. "I think I'll 
take a walk, honey. Some fresh 
air would do me good." 

"Jim, don't go. I'd rather not 
be alone just now." 

"Well." He looked at her, keep- 
ing his expression blank. "All 
right, dear. How about some cof- 
fee? I could stand another cup." 
And he thought: Tomorrow I'll go. 
I'll talk to Holland tomorrow. 

"Let me get this straight, Jim." 
Holland's pudgy face was sober, 
his eyes serious. "You started out 
by thinking Jean was showing 
paranoid tendencies, and offhand 
I'm inclined to agree with you. 
Overnight you changed your mind 
and began thinking that maybe, 
just maybe, she might be right. 
Honestly, don't you suspect your 
own reasons for such a quick 
switch?" 

"Sure I do, Bob," Blair said 
worriedly. "Do you think I 
haven't beaten out my brains 
over it? I know the idea's mon- 

THE CUCKOO CLOCK 



strous. But just suppose there was 
a branch of humanity — if you 
could call it human — living off us 
unsuspected. A branch that knows 
how to eliminate — competition 
— almost by instinct." 

"Now hold on a minute, Jim. 
You've taken Jean's reaction to 
this last death, plus a random as- 
sociation with a cuckoo clock, and 
here you are with a perfectly wild 
hypothesis. You've always been 
rational and analytical, old man. 
Surely you can realize that a per- 
fectly normal urge to rationalize 
Jean's conclusions is making you 
concur with them against your 
better judgment." 
"Bob — " 

"I'm not through, Jim. Just 
consider how fantastic the whole 
idea is. Because of a series of acci- 
dents you can't accuse a child of 
planned murder. Nor can you fur- 
ther hypothesize that all orphans 
are changelings, imbued with an 
instinct to polish off their foster- 
siblings." 

"Not all orphans, Bob. Not 
planned murder, either. Take it 
easy. Just some of them. A few of 
them — different.- Growing up. 
Placing their young with well to 
do families somehow, and then 
dropping unobtrusively out of the 
picture. And the young growing 
up, and always the natural chil- 
dren dying off in one way or an- 
other. The changeling inherits, 
and the process is repeated, step 
by step. Can )'ou say it's impos- 

121 



sible? Do you know it's impos- 
sible?" 

"I wouldn't say impossible, 
Jim. But I would say that your 
thesis has a remarkably low index 
of probability. Why don't others 
suspect, besides you?" 

Jim spread his hands hope- 
lessly. "I don't know. Maybe 
they do. Maybe these creatures — 
if they do exist — have some 
means of protection we don't 
know about." 

"You need more than maybes, 
Jim. What about Joanna Sim- 
mons' mother? According to your 
theories she should have been 
well off. Was she?" 

"No, she wasn't," Jim admitted 
reluctantly. "She came here and 
took a job with my outfit. Said 
she was divorced, and had lived 
in New York. Then she quit to 
take a position in California, and 
we agreed to board Joanna until 
she got settled. Warrenburg was 
the town. She was killed there 
quite horribly, in a terrible auto 
accident." 

"Have you any reason for sus- 
pecting skulduggery? Honestly, 
Jim? Or for labelling her one of 
your human — er — cuckoos? " 

"Only my hunch. We had a 
newspaper clipping, and a letter 
from the coroner. We even sent 
the money for her funeral. But 
those things could be faked, Bob." 

"Give me some evidence that 
they were faked, and I'll be happy 
to reinspect your views." Holland 



levered his avoirdupois out of his 
chair. "In the meantime, relax. 
Take a trip if you can. Try not to 
worry." 

Jim grinned humorlessly. 
"Mustn^t let myself get excited, 
eh? Okay, Bob. But if I get hold 
of any evidence that I think you 
might accept, I'll be back. The 
last laugh and all that. Pending 
developments you take it easy, 
too. Don't let yourself get over- 
worked. Stay out of the sun. So 
long now." 

"So long, Jim." 

It was cool in the Warrenburg 
city hall, though outside the 
streets were sizzling. 

"Sorry, Mr. Blair," said the 
stout, motherly woman with the 
horn-rimmed glasses. "We've no 
record of a Helen Simmons. Noth- 
ing whatever." She closed the file 
with resolute finality. 

Jim stared at her. "Are you 
sure? There must be something. 
Mightn't there be a special file for 
accident cases? She was here in 
Warrenburg. She died here." 

The woman thinned her lips, 
shook her head. "If we had any 
information, it'd be right where 
I looked. There isn't a thing. 
Have you tried her last address? 
Maybe they could tell you some- 
thing. We can't." 

"I'll try that next. Thanks a 
lot." 

"Sorry we couldn't help you." 
He went out slowly. 



122 



 



872 Maple was a rambling 
frame house dozing on a wide 
flower bordered lot. There was 
nothing sleepy about the diminu- 
tive woman who opened the door 
to Jim's knock. Snapping black 
eyes peered at him from a maze of 
wrinkles. A veined hand moved 
swiftly to smooth down the white 
hair that framed her face. 

"Looking for someone, young 
man?" 

"Just information, Mrs. — " 

"Collins, and it's Miss. Don't 
give out information about guests. 
You a bill collector? " 

"No, Miss Collins. As a matter 
of fact, I'm trying to check up on 
an old friend I lost track of. Helen 
Simmons. She lived at this address 
for a while." 

"Sure did. Well, come on in.. 
Mind you, I don't usually do this, 
Mr.—" 

"Blair." Without any fanfare a 
bill changed hands. 

"Mr. Blair. Well, I can't tell 
you much. Try that green chair 
for size. What do you want to 
know?" 

Jim studied the toe of his right 
shoe. His eyes were veiled. "I 
heard she was hurt, and hard up, 
and I was worried. My wife and I 
were friends of hers back east." 

"Hurt, hard up? Humph! Not 
likely, spendin' all her time drivin' 
that English car around. Takin' 
trips. I'm not sayin' she didn't 
mind her manners, though." 



"Did she have any close 
friends?" 

"She was chummy with Edith 
Walton, the girl that works for 
Doc Mendel. He's county coroner 
in his spare time. No men. Didn't 
fool around at all. I'd a known." 

Behind Jim's stony eyes the 
pattern took clearer form, as if a 
mosaic approached completion. A 
mosaic of carefully planned events 
that totalled horror. He shivered 
as the outlines of his hunch filled 
in. Helen — what creatures were 
these? Helen — not dead, not 
poor, — carefully planting osten- 
sible proof of her death and going 
on to a new role, a new life, in 
London or Paris or Rome. A free, 
untrammelled life. And her child 

— if child was the word — in his 
home, repeating the pattern. 
Eliminating competition as her 
mother undoubtedly had done. 
The competition — his and Jean's 
children! Changeling, changeling 

— No, not that. Incubus! He 
shivered again. 

"Rabbits on your grave, Mr. 
Blair?" 

He looked up slowly. "Sorry. I 
was just wondering. Did Miss 
Simmons have a job while she was 
here?" 

"No, she didn't. One thing she 
did do was rent a place. Used to 
be Blands Hardware. Paid a 
month's rent, too. Said some 
friends of hers were plannin' to 
open a mortuary. Seemed like a 



THE CUCKOO CLOCK 



123 



funny way for people to do busi- 
ness, but then, no affair of mine." 

Funny? No, not funny at all, 
but icily, eerily logical. There had 
to be an undertaking parlor where 
he could send the funeral ex- 
penses. He wondered if Helen had 
laughed when she opened the let- 
ter. Everyone his, or her, own 
undertaker. And the carefully 
cultivated friend in the coroner's 
office. For stationery. 

He got to his feet. "Thanks a 
lot, Miss Collins. You've been a 
great deal of help." He almost 
smiled as he asked, "I don't sup- 
pose she left a forwarding ad- 
dress?" 

The old head shook decisively. 
"Not a thing. Just packed and 
left, one Monday morning." 

All the loose ends tied up tight 
on a Monday morning. Nothing 
to cause suspicion. Nothing to 
worry about. Only a woman's al- 
most paranoid hysteria, — and a 
glance at a clock. Not very much 
to unmask — incubus. And what 
could he do? What could he do? 
Start talking and land in an insti- 
tution? Well, there was one thing. 

"Thanks again, Miss Collins." 

He went out. 

Swanson didn't look like the 
general conception of a small town 
newspaperman. One knew instinc- 
tively that his beard wouldn't 
have been tobacco-stained even if 
he'd cared to grow one. And he 
didn't have a bottle of bourbon in 



the file marked Miscellaneous, or 
if he did he didn't bring it out. 

"That never came from my 
paper," he said precisely. He 
handed the clipping back to Jim. 
"We don't use that type, for one 
thing. For another, Miss Sim- 
mons, so far as I know, wasn't 
killed here or anywhere else." 

"You knew her?" 

"I knew of her. I never met 
her." 

"What about this report of her 
death?" 

Swanson shrugged ; tented mani- 
cured fingers. "It's a hoax. Any 
job printing shop with a linotype 
could do it. In all likelihood it was 
some place in San Francisco. 
That's closest. It would be very 
difficult to check." His curiosity 
was showing. 

"I see. Well, thanks for your 
time and trouble, Mr. Swanson." 

"Not at all. Sorry I couldn't be 
of more help." 

One thing to do. One thing that 
must be done. 

Motors over the mountains. 
And riding with them, the numb 
resolve. Motors over the salt pans, 
the wheat lands, the corn belt. 

The stewardess stops again. 
"Coffee, sir? A sandwich, per- 
haps?" 

"I beg your — Oh no. No 
thanks." 

She watches him covertly, un- 
easily, longing for the end of the 
run. 

Motors in the night. 



124 



 



And the dull determination 
growing, strengthening. 

The airport, baggage, the an- 
cient taxi with the piston slap, 
and at last the dark, familiar 
street. 

"Jim, you're back! Oh Jim, 
darling. Next time they send you 
west I'm going too. I am!" 

"Okay Jean, sure. Why not?" 

"What's the matter, dear? Oh, 
you're tired, of course. I should 
have known. Sit down, Jim. Let 
me get you a drink." 

"In a minute, Jean." Do it 
now now NOW! "Where's Jo- 
anna?" 

"She's in bed. Hours ago. Jim, 
has something — ?" 

"Nothing, dear. I just want to 
look in on her. And freshen up a 
bit, of course." 

"Jim — " 

He smoothed away the worried 
frown with his forefinger. 

"In a minute, dear." 

She smiled uncertainly. "Hurry 
back, Jim." 

The stairs unwind irrevocably, 
slow motion in a nightmare. The 
bedroom door opens, the hall light 
dim on the bed and the child's 
face. Incubus in the half dark. 

For a moment Jim remembered 
wondering somewhere, sometime, 
what strange powers of protection 
might be implicit in such a crea- 
ture. As the thought came into his 
mind, Joanna stirred. She opened 
her eyes and looked at him. 



He took one step toward the 
bed. 

The little girl eyes over their 
dusting of freckles slitted. Then 
they opened wide, became two 
glowing golden lakes that grew, 
and grew — 

There was the feeling of a great 
soundless explosion in his mind. 
Waves of cool burning in his 
brain, churning and bubbling in 
every unknown corner, every 
cranny. Here and there a cell, or 
a group of cells, blanked out, the 
complex molecules reverting, be- 
coming new again. Ready for fresh 
punch marks. Synapses shorted 
with soundless cold fire, and 
waited in timeless stasis for re- 
channelling. The waves frothed, 
became ripples, were gone. He 
stood unmoving. 

What was it he was supposed 
to do? Let's see — Tuck Joanna's 
blanket around her. But she was 
covered up snugly. Sleeping soundly, 
too, and for a few seconds he'd 
thought she was awake. And Jean 
was waiting downstairs, Jean and 
a cool drink. 

Oh yes, stop in the bathroom. 
The stairs wind up again. It is 
good to be with one's family, re- 
laxed in the well known chair. Not 
a worry in the world. 

He sat there, his mind at ease, 
not caring much about anything. 
He didn't even look up when the 
clock on the mantel whirred, and 
the ridiculous bird popped out of 
its nest to herald a new day. 



THE CUCKOO CLOCK 



125 



APPOINTMENT AT NOON 

BY ERIC FRANK RUSSELL 

He had no calling card, no references, nor any ap- 
parent reason for coming. But he would not be put off. 



Henry curran was big, busy 
and impatient of triflers. He 
had the build of a wrestler, the 
soul of a tiger, and his time was 
worth a thousand bucks and hour. 
He knew of nobody who rated 
more. 

And crime did not pay? Bah! 

Jungle tactics paid off. The 
entire opposition had been con- 
ditioned out of men by what 
is called civilisation. 

Entering his spacious office with 
the swift, heavy tread of a large 
man in fighting trim, Henry slung 
his hat onto a hook, glanced at 
the wall-clock, noted that it regis- 
tered ten minutes to twelve. 

Planting himself in the seat 
behind his desk, he kept his 
expectant gaze upon the door 
through which he had entered. 
His wait lasted about ten seconds. 
Scowling at the thought of it, 
Curran reached over and thumbed 



a red stud on his big desk. 

"What's wrong with you?" he 
snapped when Miss Reed came in. 
"You get worse every day. Old 
age creeping over you or some- 
thing?" 

She posed, tall, neat and pre- 
cise, facing him cross the desk, 
her eyes wearing a touch of 
humility born of fear. Curran 
employed only those about whom 
he knew too much. 

"I'm sorry, Mr. Curran, I 
was — " 

"Never mind the alibi. Be 
faster — or else! Speed's what I 
like. Speed — see?" 

"Yes, Mr. Curran." 

"Has Lolordo phoned in yet?" 

"No, Mr. Curran." 

"He should be through by 
now if everything went all right." 
He viewed the clock again, tapped 
irritably on his desk. "If he's 
made a mess of it and the mouth- 



126 



piece comes on, tell him to let 
Lolordo stew. He's in no position 
to talk, anyway. A spell in jail 
will teach him not to be stupid." 

"Yes, Mr. Curran. There's an 
old—" 

"Shut up till I've finished. 
If Michaelson calls up and says 
the Firefly got through, ring 
Voss and tell him without delay. 
And I mean without delay! That's 
important!" He mused a moment, 
finished, "There's that meeting 
downtown at twelve-twenty. God 
knows how long it will go on but 
if they want trouble they can 
have it aplenty. If anyone asks, 
you don't know where I am and 
you don't expect me back before 
four." 

"But, Mr. Curran—" 

"You heard what I said. No- 
bodv sees me before four." 

"There's a man already here," 
she got out with a sort of apologe- 
tic breathlessness. "He said you 
have an appointment with him at 
two minutes to twelve." 

"And you fell for a gag like 
that?" He studied her with open 
contempt. 

"I can only repeat what he 
said. He seemed quite sincere." 

"That's a change," scoffed 
Curran. "Sincerity in the outer 
office. He's got the wrong address. 
Go tell him to spread himself 
across the tracks." 

" I said you were out and didn't 
know when you would return. 
He took a seat and said he'd 



wait because you would be back 
at ten to twelve." 

Involuntarily, both stared at 
the clock. Curran bent an arm, 
eyed his wristwatch by way of 
checking the accuracy of the in- 
strument on the wall. 

"That's what the scientific 
bigbrains would call precognition. 
I call it a lucky guess. One minute 
either way would have made him 
wrong. He ought to back horses." 
He made a gesture of dismissal. 
"Push him out — or do I have 
to get the boys to do it for you?" 

"That wouldn't be necessary. 
He is old and blind." 

"I don't give a damn if he's 
armless and legless — that's his 
tough luck. Give him the rush." 

Obediently she left. A few mo- 
ments later she was back with 
the martyred air of one compelled 
to face his wrath. 

"I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Cur- 
ran, but he insists that he has 
a date with you for two minutes 
to twelve. He is to see you about 
a personal matter of major im- 
portance." 

Curran scowled at the wall. 
The clock said four minutes to 
twelve. He spoke with sardonic 
emphasis. 

"I know no blind man and I 
don't forget appointments. Throw 
him down the stairs." 

She hesitated, standing there 
wide-eyed. " I 'm wondering 
whether — " 



127 



"Out with it!" 

"Whether he's been sent to 
you by someone who'd rather 
he couldn't identify you by sight." 

He thought it over, said 
"Could be. You use your brains 
once in a while. What's his 
name?" 

"He won't say." 

"Nor state his business?" 

"No." 

"H'm! I'll give him two min- 
utes. If he's panhandling for 
some charity he'll go out through 
the window. Tell him time is 
precious and show him in." 

She went away, brought back 
the visitor, gave him a chair. 
The door closed quietly behind 
her. The clock said three minutes 
before the hour. 

Curran lounged back and sur- 
veyed his caller, finding him tall, 
gaunt and white-haired. The old- 
ster's clothes were uniformly 
black, a deep, somber, solemn 
black that accentuated the bril- 
liance of the blue, unseeing eyes 
staring from his colorless face. 

Those strange eyes were the 
other's most noteworthy feature. 
They held a most curious quality 
of blank penetration as if some- 
how they could look into the 
things they could not look at. 
And they were sorry — sorry for 
what they saw. 

For the first time in his life 
feeling a faint note of alarm, 



Curran said, "What can I do for 
you?" 

"Nothing," responded the 
other. "Nothing at all." 

His low, organlike voice was 
pitched at no more than a whisper 
and with its sounding a queer 
coldness came over the room. He 
sat there unmoving and staring 
at whatever a blind man can see. 
The coldness increased, became 
bitter. Curran shivered despite 
himself. He scowled and got a 
hold on himself. 

"Don't take up my time," 
advised Curran. "State your busi- 
ness or get to hell out." 

"People don't take up time. 
Time takes up people." 

"What the blazes do you 
mean? Who are you?" 

"You know who I am. Every 
man is a shining sun unto himself 
until dimmed by his dark com- 
panion." 

"You're not funny," said Cur- 
ran, freezing. 

"I am never funny." 

The tiger light blazed in Cur- 
ran's eyes as he stood up, placed 
a thick, firm finger near his desk- 
stud. 

"Enough of this tomfoolery! 
What d'you want?" 

Suddenly extending a length- 
less, dimensionless arm, Death 
whispered sadly, "You!" 

And took him. 

At exactly two minutes to 
twelve.

"In another ten years, at ma- 
turity, you will be completely ac- 
climated to Mars. Its air will be 
your air; its food plants your food. 
Its extremes of temperature will 
be easy for you to endure and its 
median temperatures pleasant to 
you. Already, because of the five 
years we spent in space under 
gradually decreased gravitational 
pull, the gravity of Mars seems 
normal to you. 

"It will be your planet, to live 
on and to populate. You are the 
children of Earth but you are the 
first Martians." 

Of course we had known a lot 
of those things already. 

The last year was the best. By 
then the air inside the dome — 
except for the pressurized parts 
where our teachers and attendants 
live — was almost like that out- 
side, and we were allowed out for 
increasingly long periods. It is 
good to be in the open. 

The last few months they re- 
laxed segregation of the sexes so 
we could begin choosing mates, 
although they told us there is to 
be no marriage until after the 
final day, after our full clearance. 
Choosing was not difficult in my 
case. I had made my choice long 
since and I'd felt sure that she felt 
the same way; I was right. 

Tomorrow is the day of our 



rom page 81) 

freedom. Tomorrow we will be 
Martians, the Martians. Tomor- 
row we shall take over the planet. 

Some among us are impatient, 
have been impatient for weeks 
now, but wiser counsel prevailed 
and we are waiting. We have 
waited twenty years and we can 
wait until the final day. 

And tomorrow is the final day. 

Tomorrow, at a signal, we will 
kill the teachers and the other 
Earthmen among us before we go 
forth. They do not suspect, so it 
will be easy. 

We have dissimilated for years 
now, and they do not know how 
we hate them. They do not know 
how disgusting and hideous we 
find them, with their ugly mis- 
shapen bodies, so narrow shoul- 
dered and tiny chested, their 
weak sibilant voices that need 
amplification to carry in our Mar- 
tian air, and above all their white 
pasty hairless skins. 

We shall kill them and then we 
shall go and smash the other 
dome so all the Earthmen there 
will die too. 

If more Earthmen ever come to 
punish us, we can live and hide 
in the hills where they'll never find 
us. And if they try to build more 
domes here we'll smash them. We 
want no more to do with Earth. 

This is our planet and we want 
no aliens. Keep off!

Death of a Spaceman 
(Continued from page 2J) 

she came back and poured him 
an insignificant drink. 
"Well?" 

"I don't know," she said. "I 
saw Father Paul on the terrace, 
talking to somebody." 

"Is it time?" 

She glanced at the clock, looked 
at him doubtfully, and nodded. 
"Nearly time." 

The orchestra finished a num- 
ber, but the babble of laughing 
voices continued. Old Donegal 
sagged. " They won't do it. They're 
the Keiths, Martha. Why should 
1 ruin their party?" 

She turned to stare at him, 
slowly shook her head. He heard 
someone shouting, but then a 
trumpet started softly, introduc- 
ing a new number. Martha sucked 
in a hurt breath, pressed her 
hands together, and hurried from 
the room. 

" It's too late," he said after her. 

Her footsteps stopped on the 
stairs. The trumpet was alone. 
Donegal listened; and there was 
no babble of voices, and the rest 
of the orchestra was silent. Only 
the trumpet sang — and it puz- 
zled him, hearing the same slow 
Jpugle-notes of the call played at 
the lowering of the colors. 

The trumpet stopped suddenly. 
Then he knew it had been for 
him. 

A brief hush — then thunder 
came from the blast-station two 



miles to the west. First the low 
reverberation, rattling the win- 
dows, then the rising growl as 
the sleek beast knifed skyward 
on a column of bluewhite hell. 
It grew and grew until it drowned 
the distant traffic sounds and 
dominated the silence outside. 

Quit crying, you old fool, you 
maudlin ass . . . 

"My boots," he whispered, 
"my boots . . . please . . ." 

"You've got them on, Donny." 

He sank quietly then. He closed 
his eyes and let his heart go up 
with the beast, and he sank into 
the gravity padding of the blast- 
room, and Caid was with him, 
and Oley. And when Ronald 
Keith, III, instructed the orches- 
tra to play Blastroom Man, after 
the beast's rumble had waned, 
Old Donegal was on his last 
moon-run, and he was grinning. 
He'd had a good day. 

Martha went to the window to 
stare out at the thin black trail 
that curled starward above the 
blast station through the twilight 
sky. Guests on the terrace were 
watching it too. 

The doorbell rang. That would 
be Ken, too late. She closed the 
window against the chill breeze, 
and went back to the bed. The 
boots, the heavy, clumsy boots — 
they clung to the bedframe, with 
his feet half out of them. She 
took them off gently and set them 
out of company's sight. Then she 
went to answer the door.
