Dumb Martian by John Wyndham




it assured him six or seven hundred would be a fair price. But 
when he got up-country, it hadn't 
turned out quite as simple as the 
Port Clarkers seemed to think. 

The first three Martian families 
he had tackled hadn't shown any 
disposition to part with their 
daughters at all. The next wanted 
$1500, and wouldn't budge. Leilie's parents had started at $1500, 
too, but they came down to $1000 
after he'd made it plain that he 
wasn't going to stand for extortion. 

On the way back to Port Clarke 
with her, when he came to work 
it out, he found himself not so 
badly pleased with the deal, after 
all. Over the five-year term of his 
appointment, it would cost him 
only $200 a year at the worst — 
that is to say, if he were not able 
to sell her for $400, maybe even 
$500, when he got back. Looked 
at that way, it wasn't really at 
all unreasonable. 

In town once more, he went to 
explain the situation and get 
things all set with the Company's 
agent. 

"Look," he said, "you know 
the way I'm fixed with this fiveyear contract as wayload station 
superintendent on Jupiter IV/II? 
Well, the ship that takes me 
there will be traveling light to 
pick up cargo. So how about 
another reservation on her?" He 
had already taken the precau


tionary step of finding out that 
the Company was accustomed to 
grant an extra passage in such 
circumstances, though not compelled to. 

The Company's agent was not 
surprised. After consulting some 
lists, he said that he saw no objection to an extra passenger. He 
explained that the Company was 
also prepared in such cases to 
supply the extra ration of food 
for one person at the nominal 
charge of $200 per annum, payable by deduction from salary. 

"What? A thousand bucks?" 
Duncan exclaimed. 

"Well worth it," said the agent. 
"It is nominal for the rations, 
because it's worth the Company's 
while to lay out the rest for something that helps to keep an employee from going nuts. That's 
pretty easy to do when you're 
fixed alone on a wayload station, 
they tell me — and I believe them. 
A thousand's not high if it helps 
you avoid a crackup." 

Duncan argued a bit, on principle, but the agent had the thing 
cut and dried. It meant that Lellie's price went up to $2000 — 
$400 a year. Still, with his own 
salary at $5000 a year, tax-free, 
unspendable during his term on 
Jupiter IV/II, and piling up 
nicely, it wouldn't come to such 
a big slice. So he agreed. 

"Fine," said the agent. "I'll 
fix it, then. All you'll need is an

embarkation permit for her,, and 
they'll grant that automatically 
on production of your marriage 
certificate." 

Duncan stared. '-'Marriage-certificate? Me marry a Mart?" The 
agent shook his head reprovingly. 
"No embarkation permit without 
it. Anti-slavery regulation. They'd 
think you meant to sell her— 
might even think you'd bought 
her." 

"What me?" Duncan said indignantly. 

"Even you," said the agent. "A 
marriage license will only cost 
you another ten dollars — unless 
you've got a wife back home, in 
which case it'll likely cost you a 
bit more later on." 

Duncan shook his head. "I've 
got no wife." 

"Uh-huh," said the agent, 
neither believing nor disbelieving. 
"Then what's the difference?" 

Duncan came back a couple of 
days later, with the certificate 
and the permit. The agent looked 
them over. 

"That's okay," he agreed. "I'll 
confirm the booking. My fee will 
be one hundred dollars." 

"Your fee?" 

"Call it safeguarding your investment," suggested the agent. 

The man who had issued the 
embarkation permit had required 
one hundred dollars, too. Duncan 
did not mention that now, but he 
said, with bitterness: "One dumb 



Mart's costing me plenty." 

"Dumb?" asked the agent, 
looking at him. 

"Speechless plus. These hick 
Marts don't know they're born." 

"H'm," said the agent. "Never 
lived here, have you?" 

"No, but I've laid-over here 
a few times." t 

The agent nodded. "They act 
dumb, and the way their faces 
are makes them look dumb. But 
they were a mighty clever people, 
once." 

"Once could be a long time 
ago." 

"Long before we got here, 
they'd given up bothering to 
think a lot. Their planet was 
dying and they were kind of content to die with it." 

"Well, I call that dumb. Aren't 
all planets dying, anyway?" 

"Ever see an old man just sitting in the Sun, taking it easy? 
It doesn't have to mean he's senile. It may, sure, but very likely 
he can snap out of it, and put his 
mind to work again if it really 
becomes necessary. But mostly 
he finds it not worth the bother. 
Less trouble just to let things 
happen." 

"Well, this one's only about 
twenty — say ten and a half of 
your Martian years — and she certainly lets 'em happen. And I'd 
say it's a kind of acid test for 
dumbness when a girl doesn't 
know what goes on at her own

wedding ceremony.** 

And then, on top of that, it 
turned out'to be necessary to lay 
out yet another hundred, dollars 
on clothing and other things for 
her, bringing the whole investment up to $2310. It was a sum 
which might possibly have been 
justified on 'a really smart girl, 
though on Lellie . . . 

But there it was. Once you 
made the first payment, you 
either lost on it, or were stuck for 
the rest. And, anyway, on a lonely wayload station, even she 
would be company — of a sort. 

THE First Officer called Duncan into the navigating room 
to take a look at his future home. 

"There it is," he said, waving 
his hand at a little world shown 
on the watch-screen. 

Duncan looked at the jaggedsurfaced crescent. There was no 
scale to it. It could have been 
the size of Luna or of a basketball. Whatever size the place 
proved to be, it was still just a 
lump of rock, turning slowly over. 
"How big?" he asked. 
Around forty miles mean 
diameter." 

"What'd that be in gravity?'* 
"Haven't worked it out. Call it 
slight, figure there isn't any, and 
you'll be near enough." 
"Uh-huh,** said Duncan, 
On the way back to the messroom, he paused to put his head 



into the cabin. Lellie was lying 
on her bunk, with the springcover fastened over her to give 
some illusion of weight. At the 
sight of him she raised herself 
on one elbow. 

She was small, not much over 
five foot. Her face and hands 
were delicate ; they had a fragility 
which was not simply a matter of 
frail bone-structure. To an Earthman, her eyes looked unnaturally 
round, seeming to give her a permanent expression of innocence 
surprised. The lobes of her ears 
hung unusually low out of a 
mass of brown hair that glinted 
with red among its waves. The 
paleness of her skin was emphasized by the color on her cheeks 
and the vivid red on her lips. 

"Hey," said Duncan, "you can 
start packing up the stuff now." 

"Packing up?" she repeated 
doubtfully, in a curiously resonant voice. 

"Sure, pack," Duncan told her. 
He demonstrated by opening a 
box, cramming some clothes into 
it, and waving a hand to include 
the rest. Her expression did not 
change, but the idea got across,, 

"We are come?" she asked. 

"We are nearly come, so get 
busy on this lot." 

"Yith — okay," she said, and 
began to unhook the cover. 

Duncan shut the door, and 
gave a shove which sent him 
floating down the passage lead


n 




 



ing to the general mess and living room. 

Inside the cabin, Lellie pushed 
away the cover. She reached 
down cautiously for a pair of 
metal soles, and attached them to 
her slippers by their clips. Still 
cautiously holding on to the 
bunk, she swung her feet over the 
side and lowered them until 
the magnetic soles clicked into 
contact with the floor. She stood 
up more confidently. 

The blown overall suit she 
wore revealed proportions that 
might be admired among Martians, but, by Earth standards, 
they were not classic. Because of 
the thinner air of Mars, her chest 
was big. But only her chest. That, 
of course, was to accommodate 
her greater lung capacity. The 
rest of her was almost childishly 
slender. 

Still ill at ease with weightlessness, she slid her feet to keep 
magnetic contact with the metal 
floor as she crossed the room. For 
some moments she paused in 
front of a wall mirror, contemplating her reflection. Then she 
turned away and began packing. 

"f~WNE hell of a place to take 
a woman to," Wishart, the 
ship's cook, was saying as Duncan came in. 

Duncan did not care a lot for 
Wishart, chiefly because, when it 
had occurred to him that Lellie 



ought to have some lessons m 
weightless cooking, Wishart had 
refused to give the tuition for lesa 
than fifty dollars, and thus increased the investment cost to 
$2360. Nevertheless, it was not 
Duncan's way to pretend to have 
misheard. 

"One hell of a place to be given 
a job," he amended grimly. 

No one replied to that. They 
knew how men came to be offered 
wayload jobs. 

It was not necessary, as the 
Company frequently pointed out, 
for superannuation at the age of 
forty to come as a hardship to 
anyone. Salaries were good, and 
the Company could cite plenty 
of cases where men had founded' 
brilliant subsequent careers on 
the savings of their space-service 
days. That was all right for the 
men who had not been obsessively interested in the fact that one 
four-legged animal can run faster 
than another. But this was not 
even an enterprising way to have 
lost one's money, so when it came 
to Duncan's time to leave crew 
work, they made him no more 
than the routine offer. 

H» had never been to Jupiter 
IV/II, but he knew just what it 
would be like — it was the second 
moon of Callisto, which was the 
fourth moon, in order of discovery, of Jupiter, and would inevitably be one of the grimmer kinds 
of cosmic pebble. 



 



53 



The Company had offered no 
alternative, so he signed up at 
the usual terms: $5000 a year for 
five years, and board and lodging, plus five months waiting time 
on half-pay before he could get 
there, plus six months afterward, 
also on half-pay. during "readjustment to gravity." 

It meant the next six years 
taken care of; five of them entirely without expenses, and a 
nice little sum at the end. 

The problem was: could you 
get through five years of isolation 
without cracking up? Even when 
the psychologists had okayed 
you, you couldn't be sure. Some 
could: others went to pieces in 
a few months and had to be 
taken off, gibbering. If you got 
through two years, they said, 
you'd be okay for five. But the 
only way to find out was to try. 

"What about my putting in the 
waiting time on Mars? I could 
live cheaper there," Duncan had 
suggested. 

They had consulted planetary 
tables and ship schedules, and 
discovered that it would be 
cheaper for them. too. They had 
declined to split the difference on 
the saving thus made, but they 
had booked him a passage for the 
following week, and arranged for 
him to draw, on credit, from the 
Company's agent there. 

The Martian colony in and 
around Port Clarke was rich in 



ex -spacemen who found it more 
comfortable to spend their rearguard years in the lesser gravity, 
broader morality, and greater 
economy there. They were great 
advisers. Duncan listened, but 
discarded most of it. Such methods of occupying oneself as learning the Bible or the works of 
Shakespeare by heart, or copying 
out three pages of the Encyclopaedia every day, or building 
model spaceships in botttes, struck 
him not only as tedious, but 
probably would drive him insane 
more quickly. The only one with 
sound practical advantages, in 
his opinion, had led him to picking Lellie to share his exile, and 
he still thought it was a sound 
one, in spite of its costing $2360. 

'He was well enough aware of 
the general opinion about it to 
refrain from adding a sharp retort to Wtshart. Instead, he conceded: "Maybe nobody ought to 
take a real woman to a place 
like that. But a Mart's different." 

"Even a Mart — *' Wishart began, but he was cut short by finding himself drift across the room 
as the arrestor tubes began to 
fire. 

Conversation ceased as everybody turned to on securing all 
loose objects. 

JUPITER IV/II was, by dofini«J tion. a sub-moon, probably a 
captured asteroid. The surface 



14 




 



was not cratered, like Luna's; it 
was simply a waste of jagged, 
riven rocks. The satellite as a 
whole had the form of an irregular ovoid, a bleak, cheerless 
lump of stone splintered off some 
vanished planet, with nothing 
whatever to commend it but its 
situation. 

There had to be wayload stations, for it would be hopelessly 
uneconomic to build big ships 
capable of landing on the major 
planets. A few of the older and 
smaller ships had actually been 
built on Earth, and so had to be 
launched from there, but the very 
first large, Moon -assembled ship 
established a new practice. Ships 
became truly spaceships and 
were no longer built to stand the 
strains of high gravitational pull. 
They began to make their voyages, carrying fuel, stores, freight, 
and changes of personnel, exclusively between satellites. The 
newer types did not put in even 
at Luna, but used the artificial 
satellite, Pseudos, exclusively as 
their Earth terminal. 

Freight between the wayload 
stations and their primaries was 
customarily consigned in powered 
cylinders known as crates; passengers were ferried back and 
forth in small rocket ships. Stations such as Pseudos, or Deimos, 
the main wayload for Mars, handled enough work to keep a crew 
busy, but in the outlying, little 



developed posts one man who was 
part handler, part watchman was 
enough. Ships visited them infrequently. On Jupiter IV/II one 
might, according to Duncan's information, expect an average of 
one every eight or nine Earth 
months. 

The ship continued to brake* 
coming in on a spiral, adjusting 
her speed to that of the satellite. 
The gyros started up to give stability. The small, jagged world 
grew until it overflowed the 
watch - screens. The ship was 
maneuvered into a close orbit. 
Miles of featureless, formidable 
rocks slid monotonously beneath 
her. 

The station site came onto the 
screen from the left — a roughly 
leveled area of a few acres, the 
first and only sign of order in the 
stony chaos. At the far end was 
a pair of hemispherical huts, one 
much larger than the other. At 
the near end, a few cylindrical 
crates were lined up beside a 
launching ramp hewn from the 
rock. Down each side of the area 
stood rows of canvas bins, some 
stuffed full to a conical shape, 
others slack, partly or entirely 
empty. A huge parabolic mirror 
was perched on a crag behind the 
station, looking like a monstrous, 
formalized flower. 

In the whole scene, there was 
only one sign of movement — a 
small space-suited figure pranc

ing madly about on a metal apron 
in front of the larger dome, waving its arms in a wild welcome. 

Duncan left the screen and 
went to the cabin. He found Lellie fighting off a large case which, 
under the influence of deceleration, seemed determined to pin 
her against the wall. He shoved 
the case aside and pulled her out. 

"We're there," he told her. "Put 
on your spacesuit." 

Her round eyes ceased watching the case and turned toward 
him. There was no telling from 
them how she felt, what she 
thought. She said, simply: 

"Thpacethuit. Yith — okay." 

STANDING in the airlock of 
the dome, the outgoing superintendent paid more attention to 
Lellie than to the pressure dial. 
He knew from experience exactly 
how long equalizing took, and 
opened his faceplate without even 
a glance at the pointer. 

"Wish I'd had the sense to 
bring one," he observed. "Could 
have been mighty useful on the 
chores, too." 

He opened the inner door, and 
led through. 

"Here it is — and welcome to 
it." he said. 

The main living room was oddly shaped by reason of the dome's 
architecture, but it was spacious. 
It was also exceedingly, sordidly 
untidy. 



"Meant to clean up. never got 
around to it," he added. He 
looked at Lellie. There was no 
visible sign of what she thought 
of the place. "Never can tell with 
Marts," he said uneasily. "They 
kind of non -register." 

Duncan agreed: "I figured this 
one was astonished at being born, 
and never got over it." 

The other man went on looking at Lellie. His eyes strayed 
from her to a gallery of pinnedup terrestrial beauties, and back 
again. 

"Sort of funny shape Marts 
have." he said, musingly. 

"This one's considered a good 
enough looker where she comes 
from," Duncan told him. a trifle 
shortly. 

"Sure. No offense, bud. I guess 
they'll all seem a funny shape to 
me after this spell." He changed 
the subject. "I'd better show you 
the ropes around here." 

Duncan signed to Lellie to 
open her faceplate so she could 
hear him, and then told her to 
get out of her suit. 

The dome was the usual type: 
double - floored, double - walled, 
with an insulated and evacuated 
space between the two, constructed as a unit and held down 
by metal bars let into the rock. 
In the living quarters there were 
three more sizable rooms, able 
to cope with increased personnel 
if trade should expand.

**The rest," the outgoing man 
explained, "is the regular station 
stores, mostly food, air-cylinders, 
spares of one kind and another, 
and water. I guess you'll have 
to watch her on water ; most 
women seem to think it grows 
naturally in pipes." 

Duncan shook his head. "Not 
Marts. Living in deserts gives 'em 
• natural respect for water." 

The other picked up a clip of 
■tore -sheets. 

"We'll check and sign these 
later. It's a nice soft job here. 
The only freight now is rare metalliferous earths. Callisto hasn't 
been opened up a lot yet. Handling's easy. They tell you when 
a crate's on the way; you switch 
on the radio beacon to bring it in. 
On dispatch, you can't go wrong 
if you follow the tables." 

He looked around the .room. 
•"All home comforts. You like to 
read? Plenty of books." He waved 
a hand at the packed rows which 
covered half the inner partition 
wall. 

Duncan said he'd never been 
much of a reader. 

"Well, it helps," said the other. 
"Find pretty well anything that's 
known somewhere in that lot. 
Records there. Fond of music?" 

Duncan said he liked a good 
tune. 

"Better try the other stuff — 
tunes get to squirreling inside 
your head. Play chess?" He 



pointed to a board, with the men 
pegged into it. 

Duncan shook his head. 

"Pity. There's a fellow over on 
Callisto who plays a pretty hot 
game. He'll be disappointed not 
to finish this one. Still, if 1 was 
fixed up the way you are, maybe 
I wouldn't have been interested 
in chess myself." His eyes strayed 
to Lellie again. "What do you 
think she's going to do here, besides doing the cooking and 
amusing you?" 

It was not a question that had 
occurred to Duncan. He shrugged. 
"She'll be okay, I guess. There's 
a natural dumbness about Marts 
— they'll sit for hours on end. doing nothing at all. It's a gift they 
got." 

"Well, it certainly should come 
in handy here," said the other. 

THE regular ship's-call work 
went on. Cases were unloaded, 
the metalliferous earth hosed from 
the bins into the holds. A small 
ferry rocket came up from Callisto carrying a couple of timeexpired prospectors, and left 
again with their two replacements. The ship's engineers 
checked over the station's machinery, made renewals, topped 
up the water tanks, charged the 
spent air-cylinders, tested, tinkered, and tested again before giving their final okay. 

Duncan stood outside on the 




 



metal apron where, not long ago, 
his predecessor had performed 
his fantastic dance of welcome, 
to watch the ship take off. She 
rose straight up, with her under 
jets pushing her gently. The curve 
of her hull became an elongated 
crescent shining against the black 
sky. The main driving jets started 
to gush white flame edged with 
pink. Quickly she picked up 
speed. Before long she had dwindled to a speck which sank behind 
the ragged skyline. 

Quite suddenly Duncan felt as 
if he, too, had dwindled. He had 
become a speck upon a barren 
mass of rock which was itself a 
speck in the immensity. The indifferent sky about him had no 
scale. It was an utterly black void 
wherein suns flared perpetually, 
without reason or purpose. 

The rocks of the satellite, rising 
up in their harsh crests and 
ridges, were without scale, too. 
He could not tell which were 
near and which were far away: 
he could not, in the jumble of 
hard-lit planes and inky shadows, even make out their true 
form. There was nothing like 
them to be seen on Earth or Mars. 
Their unweathered edges were 
sharp as blades; they had been 
just as sharp as that for millions, 
upon millions of years, and would 
be for as long as the satellite 
existed. 

The unchanging eons seemed 



to stretch out before and behind 
him. All life was a speck, a briefly 
transitory accident, utterly unimportant to the universe, a queer 
little note dancing for a short 
moment in the light of the eternal 
suns. Reality was just globes of 
fire and balls of stone senselessly 
rolling along through emptiness, 
through time unimaginable. 

Within his heated suit, Duncan 
shivered 'a little. Never before 
had he been so alone, never so 
much aware of the vast, callous, 
futile loneliness of space. Looking 
out into the blackness, with light 
that had left a star a million 
years ago shining into his eyes, 
he wondered: "What the heck's 
it all about, anyway?" 

The sound of his own unanswerable question broke up the 
mood. He shook his head to clear 
it of speculative nonsense. He 
turned his back on the Universe, 
reducing it again to its proper 
status as a background for life 
in general and human life in particular, and stepped into the airlock. 

AS his predecessor had told 
him, the job was soft. Duncan 
made his radio contacts with Callisto at pre-arranged times. Usually it was little more than a 
formal check on one another's 
continued existence, with perhaps 
an exchange of comment on the 
radio news. Only occasionally did 



 



they announce a dispatch and 
tell him when to switch on his 
beacon. Then, in due course, the 
cylinder crete would make its appearance and float slowly down. 
It was quite a simple matter to 
couple it up to a bin to transfer 
the load. 

The satellite's day was too 
short for convenience, and its 
night, lit by Callisto, and sometimes by Jupiter as well, was 
almost as bright; so they disregarded it and lived by the calendar clock which kept Earth time 
on the Greenwich Meridian setting. At first, much of the time 
had been occupied in ^disposing of 
the freight that the ship had left. 
Some of it went into the main 
dome — necessities for themselves, 
and other items that would store 
better where there was warmth 
and air, some into the small, airless, unheated dome. The greater 
part was stowed and padded carefully into cylinders and launched 
off to the Callisto base. But once 
that work had been cleared, the 
job was certainly soft, too 
soft . . . 

Duncan drew up a program. At 
regular intervals he would inspect 
this and that, he would leap almost weightlessly up to the crag, 
check on the Sun motor there, 
and so forth. But keeping to an 
unnecessary program requires 
resolution. 

Sun motors, for instance, were 



built to run for a long time without attention. The only action 
one could take if theirs stopped 
would be to call Callisto for a 
ferry rocket to come and take 
Lellie and himself off until a ship 
arrived to repair it. A breakdown 
there, the Company had explained 
very clearly, was the only thing 
that would justify him in leaving 
his station, with the stores of precious earths, unmanned (and it 
was also indicated that to contrive a breakdown for the sake 
of a change was unlikely to prove 
worthwhile). 

One way and another, the program did not last very long. 

There were times when Duncan 
found himself wondering whether 
bringing Lellie had been such a 
good idea, after all. On the purely practical side, he would not 
have cooked as well as she did, 
and probably have pigged it quite 
as badly as his predecessor had, 
but if she had not been there, the 
necessity of looking after himself 
would have given him something 
to do. And even from the standpoint of company — well, she was 
that, of a sort, but she was alien, 
queer; kind of like a half -robot, 
and dumb at that; certainly no 
fun. 

There were times — increasingly 
frequent times — when the very 
look of her irritated him intensely. So did the way she moved, 
and her gestures, and her silly 



40 




 



pidgin-talk when she talked, and 
her self-contained silence when 
she didn't, and her remoteness, 
and all her differentness, and the 
fact that he would have been 
$2360 better off without her. 

Nor did she make a serious attempt to remedy her shortcomings, even where she had the 
means. Her face, for instance. 
You'd think any girl would try to 
make her best of that — but did 
she? There -was that left eyebrow 
again; it made her look like a 
drunken clown, but a lot she 
cared . . . 

"For heaven's sake," he told 
her once more, "put the cockeyed 
thing straight. Don't you know 
how to fix 'em yet? And you've 
got your color on wrong, too. 
Look at that picture — now look at 
yourself in the mirror: a smear 
of red all in the wrong place. And 
your hair, too, getting like seaweed again. You've got the things 
to wave it, so stop looking like a 
damned mermaid. I know you 
can't help being a dumb Mart, 
but you can at least try to look 
like a real woman," 

Lellie studied the colored picture, and then compared her reflection with it, critically. 

"Yith — okay," she said with 
compliant . detachment. 

Duncan snorted. "And that's 
another thing. It's not 'yith,' it's 
*yes.' Y-E-S, yes. Say 'yes.' " 

"Yith," said Lellie, obligingly. 



**Oh, for — Can't you ftear the 
difference? S-s-s, not th-th-th. 
Ye-sss." 

"Yith," she said. 

"No. Put your tongue further 
back like this — " 

The lesson went on for some 
time. Finally he grew angry. 

"Just making a monkey out of 
me, huh? You'd better be careful! Now, say 'y es -' *' 

She hesitated, looking at his 
wrathful face. 

"Go on, say it P* 

"Y-yeth," she tried, nervously. 

His hand slapped across her 
face harder than he had intended. 
The jolt broke her magnetic contact with the floor and sent her 
sailing across the room in a spin 
of arms and legs. She struck the 
opposite wall and rebounded, to 
float helplessly, out of reach of 
any hold. He strode after her, 
turned her right way up, and set 
her on her feet. His left hand 
clutched her overall in a bunch, 
just below her throat, his right 
fist raised. 

** Again!" he told her. 

Her eyes looked helplessly this 
way and that. He shook her. She 
tried. At the sixth attempt she 
managed: "Yeths." 

He accepted that for the time 
being. 

"You can do it, you see, when 
you try! Well, you're damn well 
going to try!" 

He let her go. She tottered

across the room, holding her 
hands to her bruised face. 

A number of times, while the 
weeks stretched so slowly into 
months, Duncan found himself 
wondering whether he was going 
to hold out. He lingered over 
what work there was as long as 
he could, but it left still too much 
time hanging on his hands. 

A middle-aged man who had 
read nothing longer than an occasional magazine article, Duncan 
did not take to books. He tired 
very quickly of the popular records, as his predecessor had 
prophesied, and could make nothing of the others. He taught himself the moves in chess from a 
book, and instructed Lellie in 
them, intending after a little 
practice with her to challenge the 
man on Callisto. Lellie, however, 
managed to win so consistently 
that he suspected he did not have 
the right kind of mind for the 
game. Instead, he taught her a 
kind of double- solitaire, but that 
didn't last long, either — the cards 
always seemed to run for Lellie. 

Occasionally, some news and 
entertainment were to be had 
from the radio. But with Earth 
somewhere around the other side 
of the Sun just then, Mars 
screened off half the time by Callisto, and the rotation of the satellite itself, reception was either 
impossible or badly distorted. 



So mostly he sat and fretted, 
hating the satellite, angry with 
himself, and irritated by Lellie. 

Just the phlegmatic way she 
went on with her tasks infuriated 
him. It seemed unfair that she 
could take it all better than he 
could simply because she was a 
dumb Mart. When his ill-temper 
became vocal, the look of her as 
she listened exasperated him still 
more. 

"For God's sake," he told her 
one time, "can't you make that 
silly face of yours mean something? Can't you laugh, or cry, or 
get mad — anything? It's enough 
to drive a guy nuts, looking at a 
face like a doll that just heard 
its first dirty story. I know you 
can't help being dumb, but get 
some expression into it." 

She went on looking at him 
without a shadow of a change. 

"Go on, you heard me! Smile, 
damn you! Smile!" 

Her mouth twitched very 
slightly. 

"Call that a smile? Now, there's 
a smile!" He pointed to a pin-up 
with a, smile like a piano keyboard. "Like that! Like this!" He 
grinned widely. 

"No," she said. "My face cannot wriggle like Earth faces." 

"Wriggle?" he repeated incensed. "Wriggle, you call it?" 
He freed himself from the chair's 
spring- cover and came toward 
her. She backed away until she 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTIOM 



was pressed against the wall. "I'll 
make yours wriggle. Go on, now 
—smile !" 

He lifted his fist. 

Lellie put her hands up to her 
face. 

"No!" she protested. "No — no 
— no!" 

TT was on the day Duncan 
marked off the eighth completed month that Callisto relayed news of a ship on the way. 
A couple of days later, he was 
able to make contact with her 
himself and confirm her arrival 
in about a week. 

He felt as if he had been given 
several stiff drinks. There were 
preparations to make, stores to 
check, deficiencies to note, a 
string of nil-nil-nil entries to be 
made in the log to bring it up to 
date. 

He bustled around as he got 
on with the job. He hummed to 
himself while he worked, and 
even ceased to be annoyed with 
Lellie. The effect of the news 
upon her was imperceptible — but, 
then, what else could you expect? 

Sharp on her estimated time, 
the ship hung above them, growing slowly larger as her upper 
jets pressed her down. The moment she was berthed, Duncan 
went aboard, with the feeling that 
everyone in sight was an old 
friend. 

The captain received him 



warmly and brought out the 
drinks. It was all routine — even 
Duncan's babbling and slightly 
inebriated manner was regular 
procedure in the circumstances. 
The only departure from pattern 
came when the captain introduced a man beside him. 

"We've brought a surprise for 
you, Superintendent. This is Doctor Whint. He'll be sharing your 
exile for a bit." 

Duncan shook hands with the 
man. "Doctor?" he said, surprised. 

"Not medicine — science," Alan 
Whint told him. "The Company's 
pushed me out here to do a geological survey — never can tell 
when you'll strike something important. I'll be here about a year. 
Hope you don't mind." 

Duncan said conventionally 
that he'd be glad to have some 
company. Later, he took Whint 
over to the dome. The geologist 
was surprised to find Lellie there; 
clearly, nobody had told him 
about her. He interrupted Duncan's explanations of the surroundings to say: 

"Won't you introduce me to 
your wife?" 

Duncan did so, without grace. 
He resented the reproving tone in 
Whint's voice; nor did he care for 
the way the geologist greeted Lellie just as if she were an Earthwoman. He was also aware that 
Whint had noticed the bruise on 



 




her cheek, which her makeup did 
not altogether cover. 

In his mind, he classified Alan 
Whint as one of the smooth, 
snooty type, and hoped that there 
was not going to be trouble with 
him. 

On the other hand, he reflected, 
trouble was better than boredom. 

IT was a matter of opinion who 
made the trouble when it 
boiled up some three months 
later. There had already been 
several occasions when it had 
lurked uneasily near. Very likely 
it would have come into the open 
long before, had Whint's work 



not taken him out of the dome 
so much. The moment of touchoff came when Lellie lifted her 
eyes from the book she was reading to ask: 

"What does 'female emancipation* mean?" 

Alan started to explain. He was 
only halfway through the first 
sentence when Duncan broke in: 

"Listen, pal, who told you to 
go putting ideas into her head?" 

Alan shrugged his shoulders 
slightly. "Why shouldn't she have 
ideas? Why shouldn't anyone?" 

"You know what I mean." 

"I never understand you guys 
who apparently can't say what 



44 



• ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you mean. Try again.** 

"All right, then. Right from the 
start, you began shoving your 
nose into things that aren't your 
business. Treating her, for instance, as if she was some classy 
dame back home." 

"I'm glad you noticed it." 

"And you think I didn't see 
why?" 

"I'm quite sure you didn't. You 
think, in your simple way, that 
I'm out to get your girl, and you 
resent that with all the weight of 
$2360. But you're wrong; I'm 
not." 

"My lvi'/e," he corrected. "She 
may be only a dumb Mart, but 



she's legally my wife and what I 
say goes." 

"Yes, Lellte is a Mart, as you 
call it. She may even be your 
wife, for all I know to the contrary. But dumb, she certainly is 
not. For one example, look at the 
speed with which she's learned 
to read — once someone took the 
trouble to show her how. I don't 
think you'd show up any too 
bright yourself in a language 
where you only knew a few words, 
and which you couldn't read." 

"It was none of your business 
to teach her. She didn't need to 
read. She was all right the v-ay 
she was. And why? So you'll get 



 



her thinking you're a better man 
than I am." 

"I talk to her the way I'd 
talk to any woman anywhereonly more simply, since she hasn't 
had the chance of an education. 
If she does think I'm a better 
man, then I agree with her. I'd 
be sorry if I couldn't." 

"I'll show you who's the better 
man — " Duncan began savagely. 

"You don't need to. I knew 
when I came here that you'd be 
a waster or you wouldn't be on 
this job— and it didn't take long 
for me to find out that you were 
a lousy bully, too. Do you suppose I haven't noticed the bruises? 
Do you think I've enjoyed having to listen to you bawling out a 
girl whom you've deliberately 
kept ignorant and defenseless 
when she has potentially ten 
times the sense you have? Having 
to watch a clod like you lording 
it over your 'dumb Mart'? You 
emetic!" 

In the heat of the moment, 
Duncan could not remember 
what an emetic was. Trying to 
remember gave him a chance to 
realize that he was older, less 
agile, not as fit as the geologist 
. . . that he'd probably get hurt 
more than he could hurt. Besides, 
Lellie was his wife. What was he 
getting so angry about? 

Both of them simmered, but 
nothing happened. Somehow the 
occasion was patched up and 



smoothed over. 

Alan continued to make his 
expeditions in the small craft 
which he had brought with him. 
He examined and explored other 
parts of the satellite, returning 
with specimen pieces of rock 
which he tested and arranged, 
carefully labeled, in cases. In his 
spare time he occupied himself, 
as before, with teaching Lellie. 

That he did it largely for his 
own occupation, as well as from 
a feeling that it should be done, 
Duncan did not altogether deny. 
But he was equally sure that, in 
continued close association, one 
thing leads to another, sooner or 
later. 

So far, there had been nothing 
between them that he could complain about — but Alan's term 
still had some nine months to go, 
even if he were relieved in time. 
Lellie was already hero-worshipping. And he was spoiling her 
more every day by this fool business of treating her as if she were 
an Earthwoman. One day they'd 
come alive to it — and then they 
would see him as an obstacle that 
would have to be removed. Prevention being better than cure, 
the sensible course was to see that 
the situation should never develop. There need not be any fuss 
about it . . . 

There was not. 

One day Alan Whint took off 
on a routine flight to prospect 




 



somewhere on the other side of 
the satellite. He never came back. 
That was all. 

rwiHERE was no telling what 
Lellie thought about it, but 
something seemed to happen to 
her. 

For several days, she spent almost all her time standing by the 
main window of the living room, 
looking out into the blackness at 
the flaring pinpoints of light. It 
was not that she was waiting or 
hoping for Alan's return — she 
knew as well as Duncan himself 
that, when thirty-six hours had 
gone by, there was no chance of 
that. She said nothing. Her expression maintained its unchanged 
exasperating look of slight surprise. Only in her eyes was there 
any perceptible difference: they 
looked as if she had withdrawn 
herself still further behind them. 

Duncan could not tell whether 
she knew or guessed anything. 
There seemed to be no way of 
finding out without planting the 
idea in her mind — if it were not 
already there. He was, without 
admitting it fully to himself, too 
nervous to turn on her viciously 
for the time she spent vacantly 
mooning out of the window. He 
had an uncomfortable awareness 
of how many ways there were for 
even a dimwit to contrive a fatal 
accident in such a place. 

As a precaution, he took to 



fitting new air-bottles to his suit 
every time he went out, and 
checking to see that they were at 
full pressure. He also took to 
placing a piece of rock so that 
the outer door of the airlock 
could not close behind him. He 
made a point of noticing that his 
food and hers came straight out 
of the same pot, and watched her 
closely while she worked. 

He still could not decide whether she knew, or suspected. After 
they were sure that Alan was 
gone, she never once mentioned 
his name . . , 

The mood stayed on her for 
perhaps a week. Then it changed 
abruptly. She paid no more attention to the bleakness outside. 
Instead, she began to read, voraciously and indiscriminately. 

Duncan found it hard to understand her absorption in the 
books, nor did he like it, but he 
decided for the moment not to 
interfere. It did, at least, have 
the advantage of keeping her 
mind off other things. 

Gradually he began to feel 
easier. The crisis was over. Either 
she had not guessed, or, if she 
had, she had decided to do nothing about it. Her addiction to 
books, however, did not abate. In 
spite of several reminders by 
Duncan that it was for company 
that he had laid out the not inconsiderable sum of $2,360, she 
continued, as if determined to 



work her way through the station's library, 

By degrees, the situation retreated into the background. 
When the next ship came, Duncan watched her anxiously in case 
she had been biding her time to 
hand on her suspicions to the 
crew. It turned out to be unnecessary. She showed no tendency to refer to the matter. 

When the ship pulled out, taking the opportunity with it, he 
was relievedly able to tell himself that he had really been right 
all along — she was just a dumb 
Mart. She had simply forgotten 
the Alan Whint incident, as a 
child might. 

AS the months of his term 
ticked steadily away, he 
found that he had, bit by bit, to 
revise that estimate of dumbness. 
She was learning from books 
tilings that he did not know himself. It even had some advantages, though it put him in a 
position he did not care for. When 
she asked, as she sometimes did 
now, for explanations, he found 
it unpleasant to be stumped by a 
Mart. 

Having the practical man's suspicion of book-acquired knowledge, he felt it necessary to explain to her how much of the 
stuff in them was a lot of nonsense, how they never really came 
to grips with the problems of life 



as he had lived it. He cited examples from his experience. 

In fact, he found himself teaching her. 

She learned quickly, too — the 
practical as well as the book 
stuff. Of necessity, he had to 
change his opinion of Marts even 
more. It wasn't that they were 
altogether dumb, as he had 
thought, just that they were normally too dumb to start using the 
brains they had. 

Once started, Lellie was a regular vacuum -cleaner for knowledge of all sorts. It didn't seem 
long before she knew as much 
about the wayload station as he 
did himself. Teaching her was 
not at all what he had intended, 
but it did provide more occupation than the boredom of the 
early days. Besides, it had occurred to him that she was an 
appreciating asset . . . 

Funny thing, that. He had 
never before thought of education as anything but a waste of 
time, but now it seriously began 
to look as if, when he got her 
back to Mars, he might recover 
quite a bit more of that $2,360 
than he had expected. Maybe 
she'd make quite a useful secretary to someone. 

He started to instruct her in 
elementary bookkeeping and finance — as much, at least, as he 
^ knew about it, which wasn't a 
great deal. 



it 




 



The months of service kept on 

piling up, going fastefr now. During the later stretch, when one 
had acquired confidence in his 
ability to get through without 
cracking up, there was a comfortable feeling about sitting 
quietly out there with the knowledge of the dollars gradually piling up at home. 

A new find opened up on Callisto, bringing a slight increase in 
deliveries to the satellite. Otherwise, the routine continued unchanged. The infrequent ships 
trailed in, loaded up, and went 
jjgain. And then, surprisingly 
moon, it was possible for Duncan 
to say to himself: 

"The ship after the next and 
I'll be through!" 

Even more surprisingly, there 
soon came the day when he stood 
on the metal apron outside the 
dome, watching a ship lifting herself off on her under jets and 
dwindling upward into the black 
sky, and was able to tell himself: 

"That's the last time I'll see 
that! When the next ship lifts off 
this dump, I'll be aboard her!" 

He stood watching her, one 
bright spark among the others, 
until the turn of the satellite carried her below his horizon. Then 
he turned back to the airlock — 
and found the door shut. 

Once he had seen that there 
was going to be no repercussion 
from the Alan Whint affair, he 



had dropped his habit of wedging 
it open with a piece, of rock. 
Whenever he emerged to do a 
job, he left it ajar, and it stayed 
that way until he came back. 
There was no wind or anything 
else on the satellite to move it. 

He laid hold of the latch-lever 
irritably and pushed. It did not 
move. 

Duncan swore at it for sticking. 
He walked to the edge of the 
metal apron, and then around the 
side of the dome so that he could 
see in at the window. Lellie was 
sitting in a chair with the springcover fixed across it, apparently 
lost in thought. The inner door 
of the airlock was standing open, 
so, of course, the outer could not 
be moved. Besides the safety 
locking device, there was all the 
dome's air-pressure to hold it 
shut. 

Forgetful for the moment, 
Duncan rapped on the thick glass 
of the double window to attract 
hec attention. She could not have 
heard a sound through there, so 
it must have been the movement 
that caught her eye and caused 
her to look up. She turned her 
head and gazed at him, without 
moving. 

Duncan stared back at her. 
Her hair was still waved, but the 
eyebrows, the color — all the other 
touches that he had insisted upon 
to make her look as much like an 
Earth woman as possible — were 



 



t9 



gone. Her eyes looked back at 
him, set as hard as stones in that 
fixed expression of mild astonishment. 

Sudden comprehension struck 
Duncan like a physical shock. He 
tried to pretend to both of them 
that he had not understood. He 
made gestures to her to close the 
inner door of the airlock. She 
went on staring back at him, 
without moving. Then he noticed 
the book she was holding in her 
hand, and recognized it. It was 
not one of the books which the 
Company had supplied for the 
station's library. It was a book of 
verse, bound in blue. 

It had once belonged to Alan 
Whint. 

¥]>A.NIC suddenly jumped out 
■■- at Duncan as he looked down 
at the row of small dials across 
his chest. At least she had not 
tampered with his air supply; 
there was pressure enough for 
thirty hours or so. A touch on 
the jet sent him floating back to 
the metal apron, where he could 
anchor his magnetic boots and 
think it over. 

The dirty Mart! Letting him 
think all this time that she had 
forgotten all about it. Nursing it 
up for him. Letting him work 
out his time while she planned. 
Waiting until he was on the very 
last stretch before she tried her 
game. 



Some minutes passed before his 
mixed anger and panic settled 
down and allowed him to think. 

Thirty hours! Time to do quite 
a lot. And even if he did not succeed in getting back into the 
dome in twenty hours or so, 
there would still be the last, desperate resort of shooting himself 
off to Callisto in one of the cylinder crates. 

Even if Lellie were to spill over 
later about the Whint business, 
what of it? He was sure enough 
that she did not know how it had 
been done. It would only be the 
word of a Mart against his own. 
Very likely they'd put her down 
as space-crazed. 

All the same, some of the mud 
might stick. It would be better to 
settle with her here and now. Besides, the cylinder idea was risky, 
to be considered only in the last 
extremity. 

Duncan jetted himself over to 
the smaller dome. In there, he 
threw out the switches on the 
lines which brought power down 
from the main batteries charged 
by the Sun motor, then sat down 
to wait. The insulated dome 
would take some time to lose all 
its heat, but not very long for a 
drop in the temperature to become perceptible, and visible on 
the thermometers, once the heat 
was off. The small -capacity lowvoltage batteries that were in the 
place wouldn't be much good to 



her, even if she did think of Jin-' 
ing them up. 

He waited an hour, while the 
faraway Sun set, and the bright 
arc of Callisto began to show over 
the horizon. Then he went back 
to the dome's window to observe 
results. He arrived just in time to 
see Lellie fastening herself into 
her spacesuit by the light of a 
couple of emergency lamps. 

He swore. A simple freezing 
out process wasn't going to work, 
then. Not only would the heated 
suit protect her, but her air supply would last longer than his — 
and there were plenty of spare 
bottles in there, even if the free 
air in the dome froze solid. 

He waited until she had put on 
the helmet, and then switched on 
the radio in his own. He saw her 
pause at the sound of his voice, 
but she deliberately switched off 
her receiver. He did not; he kept 
his open, to be ready for the moment when she would come to her 
senses. 

T\UNCAN returned to the 
apron and reconsidered. It 
had been his intention to force 
his way into the dome without 
damaging it, if he could. But if 
she wasn't to be frozen out, that 
looked difficult. She had the advantage in air, and though it was 
true that in her spacesuit she 
-could neither eat nor drink, the 
same, unfortunately, was true for 



him. The only way seemed to be 
to tackle the dome itself. 

Reluctantly, he went back to 
the small dome again and connected up the electrical cutter. 
Its cable looped behind him as he 
jetted across to the main dome 
once more. Beside the curving 
metal wall, he paused to think 
out the job — and the consequences. 

Once he was through the outer 
shell there would be a space, then 
the insulating material— that was 
all right; it would melt away like 
butter, and without oxygen it 
could not catch fire. The more 
awkward part was going to come 
with the inner metal skin. It 
would be wisest to start with a 
few small cuts to let the airpressure down — and stand clear 
of it. If it were all to come out 
with a whoosh, he would stand 
a good chance, in his weightless 
state, of being blown a considerable distance by it. 

And what would she do? She*d 
very likely try covering up the 
holes as he made them — a bit 
awkward if she had the sense to 
use asbestos packing. It'll have to 
be the whoosh then. 

Both shells could be welded 
up again before he re-aerated 
the, place from cylinders. The 
small loss of insulating material 
wouldn't matter. Okay, better get 
down to it, then . . . 

He made his connections and 


contrived to anchor himself 
enough to give some purchase. 
He brought the cutter up and 
pressed the trigger - switch. He 
pressed again and then swore, 
remembering that he had shut 
off the power. 

Pulling himself back along the 
cable, he pushed the switches in, 
again. Light from the dome's windows suddenly illuminated the 
rocks. He wondered if the restoration of power would let Lellie 
know what he was doing. Hell 
with it. She'd know soon enough. 

He settled himself down beside 
the dome once more. This time 
the cutter worked. It took only a 
few minutes to slice out a rough 
two -foot circle. He pulled the 
piece out of the way and inspected the opening. Then, as he 
leveled the cutter again, there 
came a click in his receiver. 

"Better not try to break in," 
Lellie said. "I'm ready for that." 

He hesitated, checking himself 
with his finger on the switch, 
wondering what counter - move 
she could have thought up. The 
threat in her voice made him uneasy. He decided to go around to 
the window and see what her 
game was, if she had one. 

She was standing by the table, 
still dressed in her spacesuit, fiddling with some apparatus she 
had set up there. For a moment 
or two he did not grasp the purpose of it. 



There was a plastic food bag, 
half - inflated, and attached in 
some way to the table top. She 
was adjusting a metal plate over 
it to a small clearance. There was 
a wire taped to the upper side of 
the bag. Duncan's eye ran back 
along the wire to a battery, a 
coil, and on to a detonator attached to a bundle of half a dozen 
blasting-sticks. 

He was uncomfortably enlightened. If the air-pressure in the 
room fell, the bag would expand; 
the wire would make contact with 
the plate; up would go the 
dome . . . 

T ELLIE finished her adjustment and connected the second wire to the battery. She 
turned to look at him through the 
window. Duncan found it was infuriatingly difficult to believe 
that, behind that silly-surprise 
frozen on her face, she could be 
aware of what she was doing. 

He tried to speak to her, but 
she had switched off and made no 
attempt to switch on again. She 
simply stood looking steadily 
back at him as he blustered and 
raged. After some minutes, she 
moved across to a chair, fastened 
the spring-cover across herself, 
and sat waiting. 

"All right, then,** Duncan 
shouted inside his helmet. "But 
you'll go up with it, damn you!** 
Which was, of course, nonsense. 


since he had no intention whatever of destroying either the dome 
or himself. 

He had never learned to tell 
what went on behind that absurd 
face. She might be coldly determined, or she might not. If it 
had been a matter of a switch 
that she had to press to destroy 
the place, he might have risked 
lier nerve failing her. But this 
way, it would be he who operated the switch, just as soon as 
he made a hole to let the air out. 

Once more he retreated to anchor himself on the apron. There 
must be some way of getting into 
the dome without letting the 
pressure down . . . 

No, there was no way that he 
could think of. It would have to 
be the cylinder crate to Callisto. 

He looked up at Callisto. hanging huge in the sky now, with 
Jupiter smaller, but brighter, beyond. It wasn't so much the 
flight, it was the landing there. 
Perhaps if he were to cram it with 
all the padding he could find . . . 
Later on, he could get the Callisto crew to ferry him back, and 
they'd find some way to get into 
the dome, and Lellie would be a 
mighty sorry girl — mighty sorry. 

Across the clearing there were 
three cylinders lined up. charged 
and ready for use. He didn't mind 
admitting he was scared of that 
landing; but, scared or not, if she 
wouldn't even turn on her radio 



to listen to him, that would be hit 

only chance. 

He made up his mind and step- ped off the metal apron. A touch 
on the jets sent him floating 
across the clearing toward the 
cylinders. Practice made it easy 
to maneuver the nearest one onto 
the ramp. Another glance at Callisto's inclination helped to reassure him; at least he would reach 
it all right. If their beacon was 
not switched on to bring him in, 
he ought to be able to call them 
on the communication radio in 
his suit when he got closer. 

He fetched more padding from 
the other cylinders, and packed 
the stuff in. While he paused to 
figure out a way of triggering the 
thing off with himself inside, he 
realized he was beginning to feel 
cold. As he turned the knob up a 
notch, he glanced down at the 
meter on his chest. The cold became a chill of horror. 

Lellie hadn't tampered with the 
flasks of air — she'd known, damn 
her, that he would check them. 
Instead, she must have shorted 
the battery or the heating circuit 
in the suit. The voltage was down 
so low that the needle barely 
kicked. Another few minutes and 
he might as well be naked in the 
cold of space, for the suit, without its heating unit, would be no 
protection whatever. 

After its first stab, the fear 
abruptly left him, giving way to

fury. She'd tricked him out of his 
last chance, but, by God, he could 
make sure she didn't get away 
with it! One small hole in the 
dome and he wouldn't die alone... 

The cold was lapping at him 
icily through the suit. He pressed 
the jet control and sent himself 
scudding back toward the dome. 

His feet and fingers were going 
first. Only by an immense effort 
was he able to operate the jet 
which stopped him by the dome. 

He struggled to press the control that would jet him down to 
it, but his fingers would no longer 
move. He wept and panted with 
the attempt to make them work. 

There was an agonizing, searing pain in his chest. He gasped 
- — and the unheated air rushed 
into his lungs and froze them. 

IN the dome's living room, Lellie stood waiting. She had seen 
the spacesuited figure come 
sweeping across the clearing at an 
abnormal speed. She understood 
what it meant. Her explosive device was already disconnected; 
now she stood alert, with a thick 
rubber mat in her hand, ready to 
clap it over any hole that might 
appear. She waited one minute, 
two minutes . . . 

When five minutes had passed, 
she went to the window. By putting her face close to the pane 
and looking sideways, she was 
able to see the whole of one 



armorclad leg and part of another. They hung there, horizontally, a few feet off the 
ground. She watched them for 
several minutes. 

She left the window, pushing 
the mat out of her hand so that it 
floated away across the room. For 
a moment or two she stood thinking. Then she went to the bookshelves and pulled out the last 
volume of the encyclopedia. She 
read long enough to satisfy herself on the exact status and 
claims which were connoted by 
the word "widow." 

She found a pad of paper and 
a pencil. She hesitated, trying to 
remember the method she had 
been taught. Then she started to 
write down figures, and became 
absorbed in them. 

At last she lifted her head and 
contemplated the result: $5,000 a 
year for five years, at 6% compound interest. 

But then she paused again. 
Very likely, a face that was not 
set forever in a look of surprised 
innocence would have frowned, 
because, naturally, there was a 
debit of $2,360. 

Being incapable of both, Lellie 
neither smiled nor frowned. She 
gravely 'entered the $2,360 as a 
capital investment and the balance as profit. 

It was quite a fortune for a 
dumb Mart.
