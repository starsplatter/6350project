THAT janitor gives me 
the creeps," Ruth said 
when she came in that 

afternoon. 

I looked up from the typewriter 
as she put the bags on the table 
and faced me. I was killing a 
second draft of a story. 

"The creeps," I repeated. 

"Yes, he does," she said. "That 
way he has of slinking around, 
like Peter Lorre." 

"Peter Lorre," I said, still concentrating on my plotting. 

"Babe," she implored, "I'm 
serious. The man is a creep." 

I snapped out of the creative 
fog with a blink. 

"Hon, what can the poor guy 
do about his face?" I said. "Heredity. Give him a break." 

She plopped down in a chair 
by the table and started to take 
out groceries, stacking cans on 
the table. 

"Listen," she said. 

I could smell it coming; that 
dead serious tone of hers which 
she isn't even aware of any more, 
but which comes every time she's 
about to make one of her "revelations" to me. 

"Yes, dear," I said. I leaned 
one elbow on the typewriter and 
gazed at her patiently. 

"You get that expression off 
your face," she said. "You always 
look at me as if I were an idiot 
child." 

I smiled. Wanly. 

"You'll be sorry," she said, 
"some night when that man 
creeps in with an axe and dismembers us." 

"He's just a poor guy earning 
a living. He mops the halls, he 
stokes the furnaces, he — " 

"We have oil heat," she said. 

"If we had furnaces, he would 
atoke them. Let us have charity. 
He labors like ourselves. I write 
stories; he mops floors. Who can 
•ay which is the greater contribution to civilization?" 

"Okay," she said with a surrendering gesture. "Okay, if you 
don't want to face facts.** 

"Which are?" I prodded. I de


cided it was best to get it out of 
her before it burned a hole in 
her mind. 

Her eyes narrowed. "You listen 
to me. That man has some reason for being here. He's no janitor. I wouldn't be surprised if . . .** 

"If this apartment house were 
just a front for a gambling establishment. A hideout for public 
enemies numbered one through 
fifteen. An abortion mill. A counterfeiter's lair. A murderer's rendezvous.** 

She was already in the kitchen 
thumping cans and boxes into the 
cupboard. 

"Okay," she said, "oJfcay," in 
that patient if-you- get-murdered don't - come - to - me - for- sympathy 
voice. "Don't say I didn't try. 
If I'm married to a wall, I can't 
help it." 

I came in and slid arms around 
her waist. I kissed her neck. 

"Stop that," she said, turning 
around. "You can't change the 
subject this easily. The janitor 
is . . ." 

"You're serious," I interrupted, 
startled. 

Her face darkened. "I am, The 
man looks at me in a funny way.** 

"What way?" I asked. 

She searched. "In ... in anticipation." 

I chuckled. "Can't blame him. 
Who wouldn't?" 

"I don't mean that way." 

"Remember the time you

thought the milkman was a knife 
killer for the Mafia?" 
"I don't care." 

I kissed her neck again. "Let's 
eat." 

.She groaned. "Why do I try to 
tell you anything?" 

"Because you love me.** 

She closed her eyes. "I give 
up," she said quietly, with the 
patience of a saint under fire. 

"Come on, hon. We have 
enough troubles." 

She shrugged. "Oh, all right." 

"Good," I said. "When are 
Phil and Marge coming?" 

"Six," she said. "I got pork." 

"Roast?" 

"Mmm-m." 

"I'll buy' that." 

"You already did." 

"I must get down to the typewriter again so we can afford it." 

While I squeezed out another 
page, I heard her muttering to 
herself in the kitchen. All that 
came through was a grim: "Murdered in our beds or something." 

**TVTO, it's fiuky," Ruth analyzed 
-L * as we sat having dinner 
that night. 

I grinned at Phil and he grinned 

back. 

"I think so, too," Marge agreed. 
"Whoever heard of charging only 
sixty-five a month for a five-roonf 
apartment, furnished? Stove, refrigerator, washer — it's fantastic!" 

"Girls," I said, "let's not quib


ble. Let's take advantage." 

"Oh\" Ruth tossed her pretty 
blonde head. "If a man said, 
'Here's a million dollars for you, 
old man,' you' d proba bly take 
it" 

"I most definitely would take 
it," I admitted. "I would then 
run like hell." 

"You're naive," she said. "You 
think everybody is Santa Claus." 

"It is a little funny," Phil said. 
"Think about it, Rick." 

I thought about it. A five-room 
apartment, brand-new, furnished 
in even better than good taste 
right down to a couple of sets of 
expensive dishes . . . 

I pursed my lips. A guy can 
get lost writing about the bars 
on Mars. Maybe it was true. I 
could see their point. Of course, 
I wouldn't show it, though. And 
spoil Ruth's and my little game 
of war? Never. 

"I think they charge too much," 
I said. 

"Oh, Lord!" Ruth was taking it 
straight, as she usually did. "Too 
much? Five rooms yet! Furniture, 
dishes, linens, a television set! 
What do you want, a swimming 
pool?" 

"A small one would be good 
enough." 

She looked at Marge and Phil. 
"Let us discuss this thing quietly. 
Let us pretend that, the fourth 
voice we hear is nothing but the 
wind in the eaves."

"1 am the wind in the eaves,* I 
•aid. 

"Listen,** Ruth restated her 
forebodings, "what if the place 
were a fluke? I mean, what if they 
just want people here for a coverup? That would explain the rent. 
You remember the rush on this 
place when they started renting?" 

I remember as well as Phil and 
Ruth and Marge. The only reason we'd got apartments was we 
all happened to be walking past 
the place when the janitor put 
out the renting sign. The four of 
us had gone right in. I remember 
our amazement, our delight, at 
the rental. Why, we'd been paying more than double for half 
the size and ratty furniture, besides. 

Phil and Marge and Ruth and 
I were the first tenants. The next 
day was like the Alamo under 
attack. It's a little hard to get an 
apartment these days. 

"I say there's something funny 
about it," Ruth finished. "And 
did you ever notice that janitor?" 

"He's a creep," I contributed. 

"He is," Marge laughed. "My 
God, he's something out of a B 
picture. Those eyes! He looks like 
Peter Lorre." 

"See!" Ruth was triumphant. 

"Kids,** I said, raising a hand 
•f weary concilation, "if there's 
something foul going on behind 
•ur backs, let's allow ft to go 
on. We aren't being asked to help 



out or suffer by it. We are living 

in a nice spot for a nice rent. 
What are we going to do — look 
into it and maybe spoil it?" 

"What if there are designs on 
us?" Ruth demanded. 

"What designs, hon?" I asked. 

"I don't know," she said. "But 
I sense something." 

"Remember the time you sensed 
the bathroom was haunted? It 
was a mouse. I told you ghosts 
don't haunt bathrooms. Well, 
anybody who wants to make a 
career out of being sinister doesn't 
go in for janitoring. Limits his 
scope too much." 

She started clearing off the 
dishes. "Are you married to a 
blind man too?" she asked Marge. 

"Men are all blind," Marge 
said, accompanying my poor 
man's seer into the kitchen. "We 
must face it and be brave." 

Phil and I lit cigarettes. 

"No kidding now," I said, so 
the girls couldn't hear, "do you 
think there's anything wrong?" 

He shrugged. "I don't know, 
Rick," he admitted. "I will say 
this — it's pretty strange to rent a 
furnished place for so little." 

Yeah, I thought, awake at last. 

Strange was the word. 

I stopped for a chat with our 
strolling cop the next morning. Johnson walks around the 
neighborhood, afternoons. There 
are vicious gangs in the vicinity. 



GALAXY SCtlNCE FICTION 



he told me, traffic is heavy and, 
besides, the kids need watching 
after three in the afternoon. 

He's a good Joe, lots of fun. I 
chat with him every day when 
I go out for anything. 

"My wife suspects foul doings 
in our apartment house," I told 
him. 

"This is my suspicion," Johnson said, dead sober. "It is my 
unwilling conclusion that, within 
those walls, six-year-olds are being forced to weave baskets by 
candle light." 

"Under the whip hand of a 
gaunt old hag," I added. 

He nodded sadly. Then he 
looked around, plotter-like. 

"You won't tell anyone will 
you?" he begged. "I want to crack 
the case all by myself." 

I patted his shoulder. "Johnton," I said, "your secret is locked 
behind these iron lips." 

"I am grateful," he said. 

We laughed. 
, "How's the wife?" he asked. 

"Suspicious," I said. "Investigating. Curious." 

"Everything normal, then.** 

"Right. I guess I'll really start 
worrying when she stops acting 
like this." 

"What is it she really suspects?" 

I grinned. "She thinks the rent 
is too cheap. Everybody around 
here, she claims, pays a lot more 
for a lot less.** 



"Is that right?" Johnson said. 

"Yeah," I said, punching his 
arm. "Don't you tell anybody. I 
don't want to lose a good deal." 

Then I went to the store. 

pJUTH said, "1 knew it. I knew 

She gazed intently at me over a 
pan of soggy clothes. 

"You knew what, hon?" I 
wanted to know, putting down the 
package of second sheets I'd gone 
out to buy. 

"This place is a fluke." She 
raised her hand warningly. "Don't 
you say a word. You just listen 
to me." 

I sat down. "Yes, dear. Not a 
word." 

"I found engines in the basement," she said, and then waited 
for a reaction. 

"What kind of engines, dear? 
Fire engines?" 

Her lips tightened. "Come on, 
now," she said, getting a little 
burned up. "I saw the things." 

She meant it. 

"I've been down there too, 
hon," I said. "How come I never 
saw any engines?" 

She looked around. I didn't like 
the way she did it. She looked 
as if she really thought someone 
might be lurking at the window, 
listening. 

"This is under the basement," 
she said. 

I looked very dubious. 



 



She stood up. "Damn it! You 
come on and I'll show you!" 

She held my hand as we went 
through the hall and into the elevator. She stood grimly by me as 
we descended, my hand tight in 
her grip. 

"When did you see them?" I 
asked, trying to make conversation. 

"When I was washing in the 
laundry down there," she said. 
"In the hallway, I mean, when I 
was bringing the clothes back. I 
was coining to the elevator and 
I saw a doorway. It was a little 
open." 

"Did you go in?" I asked. 
She looked irritably at me. 
"You went in," I said. 
"I went down the steps there 
an i it was light and . . .** 
"And you saw engines." 
"That's right." 
"Big ones?" 

The elevator stopped and the 
doors slid open. We went out. 

"I'll show you how big," she 
said. It was a blank wall. "It's 
here." 

I looked at her. I tapped the 
wall. "Honey," I said. 

"Don't you dare say it f* she 
■napped. "Have you ever heard 
•f doors in a wall?" 

"Was this door in the wall?" 

**The wall probably slides over 
st," she scud, starting to tap. It 
sounded solid to me. "Darn it! 
I saw it, I tdl you. I ean just hear 



what you're going to say." 

I didn't say it. I just stood there 
watching her. 

"Lose something?" 

The janitor's voice behind us 
was sort of like Lorre's, low and 
insinuating. 

Ruth gasped, caught way off 
guard. I jumped a bit myself. 

"My wife thinks there's a — ** 

"I was showing him the right 
way to hang a picture," Ruth 
interrupted hastily. "That's the 
way, babe." She turned toward 
me. "You put the nail in at an 
angle, not straight in. Now do 
you understand?" 

The janitor smiled. 

"See you," I said awkwardly. I 
felt his eyes on us as we walked 
back to the elevator. 

When the doors shut, Ruth 
turned quickly. 

"Good night !" she stormed. 
"What are you tryin to do, get 
him on us?" 

"What . . . ?" 

"Never mind," she said. "There 
are engines down there. Huge 
engines. I saw them. And he 
knows about them." 

"Baby," I said, "why don't . . 

"Look at me," she said quickly. 

I looked. 

"Do you think I'm crazy?" she 
asked. "Come on, now. Never 
mind the hesitation." 

I sighed. "I think you're hnaginative." 

She looked disgusted. "You're 



• MAX Y SCIINCI FICTION 



as bad as . . /* 

"You and Galileo," I added. 
"It's tough being ahead of your 
generation. Happens, though, to 
every genius." 

"I'll show you those things," 
she said. "We're going down there 
again tonight, when that janitor 
is asleep. If he's ever asleep." 

I got worried. "Honey, cut it 
out. You'll get me started, too." 

"Good," she said. "Good. I 
thought it would take a hurricane." 

I sat staring at my typewriter 
all afternoon, nothing coining out. 
But concern. 

I didn't get it. Was she actually 
serious? All right, I thought, I'll 
take it seriously. She saw a door 
that was left open. Accidentally. 
That was obvious. If there really 
were huge engines under the 
apartment house, as she said, then 
the people who built them damn 
well wouldn't want anyone to 
know about them. 

East 7 th Street. An apartment 
house. And huge engines underneath it. 

Now where's the sense in that? 

SHE was shaking: Her face was 
white. She stared at me like 
a kid who's read her first horror 
story. 

"The janitor has three eyes.'" 
"Honey," I said. I put my arms 

around her. She was really scared. 

I felt sort of scared myself. And 

 



not about the janitor having an 
extra eye, either. 

I didn't say anything at first. 
What can you say when your 
wife comes up with something 
like that? 

She shook a long time. Then 
she spoke in a quiet voice, a timid 
voice: "You don't believe me." 

I swallowed. "Baby," I said 
helplessly. 

"We're going down tonight,** 
she stated. "This is really important now. It's nothing to joke 
about." 

"I don't think we should . . .** 
I started to say. 

"I'm going down there." She 
sounded edgy now, a little hysterical. "I tell you there are engines down there. Goddam it, 
there are engines!" 

She started crying now. I patted her head, rested it against my 
shoulder. 

"AH right, baby," I said. "All 
right." 

She tried to tell me through her 
tears, but it wouldn't work. Later, 
when she'd calmed down, I listened. I didn't want to get her 
upset. 1 figured the safest way 
was just to listen. 

"I was walking through the hall 
downstairs," she said. "I thought 
maybe there was some afternoon 
mail. You know, once in a while 
our mailman will . . ." 

"I know, hon," I soothed. "He 
comes around with another mail

when the deliveries are heavy." 

She stopped. "Never mind that. 
What matters is that 1 walked 
past the janitor." 

"And?" I asked, afraid of what 
was coming. 

"He smiled," she said. "You 
know the way he does. Sweet and 
murderous." 

I didn't argue the point. I still 
didn't think the janitor was anything but a harmless guy who had 
the misfortune to be born with a 
face that was strictly from 
Charles Addams. 

4 'So?" I said. '*Then what?'' 

"I walked pas^t him. I felt myself shivering, because he looked 
at me as if he knew something 
about me I didn't even know. I 
don't care what you say, that's 
the feeling I got. And then . . ." 

She shuddered. I took her hand. 

"Then?" 

**I felt him looking at me." 

I'd felt that, too, when he had 
found us in the basement. I knew 
what she meant. You actually 
felt the guy looking at you. 

"All right," I said, "I'll buy 
that." 

"You won't buy this," she went 
on grimly. "When I turned 
around to took, lie was walking 
away from me." 

"Oh, you both turned at the 
same time?" 

She slapped the table. "I 
turned. He didn't." 

"But you just said — " 



"He was looking at me. He was 
walking away and his head was to 
the front and he was looking at 
me." 

I sat there numbly. I patted 
her hand without even knowing I 
was doing it. 

"How , hon ? " I hea rd m y self 
asking her. 

"There was an eye in the back 
of his head." 

"Hon!" I said. 

She closed her eyes. She clasped 
her hands after drawing away the 
one I was holding. She pressed 
her Hps together. I saw a tear 
wriggle out from under her left 
eyelid and roll dowp her cheek. 
She was white. 

"I saw it," she said quietly. 
"So help me, I saw that eye." 

I don't know why I went on 
with it. Self-torture, I guess. I 
really wanted to forget the whole 
thing, pretend it never even happened, but I couldn't leave it at 
that. 

"Why haven't we noticed it 
before, Ruth?" I asked. "We've 
seen the back of the man's head 
before." 

"Have we?" she said. "Have 
we?" 

"Sweetheart, somebody must 
have seen it. Do you think there's 
never anybody behind him?" 

"His hair parted. Rick, and before I ran away, I saw the hair 
going back over it. So you 
couldn't see it."

What could a guy possibly say 
to his wife when she talks to him 
like that? You're nuts? You're 
batty? Or the old, tired, "You've 
been working too hard"? She 
hadn't been working too hard. I 
make a living on my writing. 
Then, again, maybe she had been 
working overtime. 

With her imagination. 

"Are you going down with me 
tonight?" she asked. 

"All right," I said quietly. "All 
right, sweetheart. Now will you 
go and lie down for a while?" 

"But it's nothing like that." 

"Sweetheart, go and lie- down,*' 
I said firmly. "I'll go with you 
toniglit, but I want you to lie 
down now." 

She went into the bedroom and 
I heard the springs squeak as she 
sat down, then again when she 
drew up her legs and fell back on 
the pillow. 

1 went in a little later to put a 
comforter over her. She was looking at the ceiling. I didn't say 
anything to her. I don't think she 
wanted to talk to me. 

"T"f/HAT c a n 1 d o?" I said to 
" Phil. 

Ruth was asleep. I'd sneaked 
across the hall to Phil's apartment. 

"Maybe she saw them," he 
said. "Isn't it possible?" 

"Yeah, sure," I said. "And you 
know what else is possible.** 



"Look, you want to go down 
and see the jaintor? You want 
to . . .** 

"No," I said. "There's nothing 

we can do." 

"You're going down to the 
basement with her?" 

"If she keeps insisting," I said. 
"Otherwise, no." 

"When you go, come and get 
us/' 

I frowned ,at him ctfriously. 
"You mean the thing is getting 
you, too?" 

He looked at me in a funny 
way. I saw his throat move. 

"Don't tell anyone," he said. 

He glanced around. Then he 
turned back. 

"Marge told me the same 
thing," he added. "She said the 
janitor has three eyes." 

¥ WENT out after supper for 
, some ice cream. Johnson was 
still walking around. 

"They're working you overtime," I said as he started to walk 
beside me. 

"They expect some trouble 
from the local gangs," he explained in that serious kidding 
way of his. 

"I never saw any trouble," I 
said distractedly. 

He shrugged. **They say to 
come here, 1 come." 

"Mmmm." 

"How's your wife?" he added. 
"Fine," I lied. 



 



"She still think the apartment 

is a front?" 

I swallowed. "No," I said- "I've 
broken her of that. I think she 
was just needling me all the 
time." 

He nodded and left me at the 
corner. For some reason, I 
couldn't keep my hands from 
shaking all the way home. I kept 
looking over my shoulder, too. 

"TJ ICK. it's time," Ruth said. 

-1* I grunted and rolled on 
my side. She nudged me. I woke 
up sort of hazy and looked automatically at the clock. The radium numbers told me it was almost four o'clock. 

"You want to go now?'* I 
asked, too sleepy to be tactful. 

There was a silence. That woke 
me up. 

. "Do you?" I insisted. 

"I'm going," she said quietly. 

I looked at her in the half -darkness, my heart starting to do a 
drum beat too heavily. My mouth 
and throat felt dry. 

"All right," I said, "wait till I 
get dressed." 

She was dressed already. I 
heard her in the kitchen making 
some coffee while I put on my 
clothes. There was no noise. I 
mean it didn't sound as if her 
hands were shaking. She spoke 
lucidly, too. But when I stared 
into the bathroom cabinet mirror, 
I saw a worried husband. 1 



washed my face with cold water 
and combed my hair. 

"Thanks," I said as she handed 
me the cup of steaming coffee. 
I stood there, nervous before my 
own wife. 

She didn't drink any coffee. 

"Are you awake?" she asked. 
I nodded. I noticed the flashlight 
and the screwdriver on the 
kitchen table. I finished the coffee. 

"I'm ready," I said, "Let's get 
it over with." 

I felt her hand on my arm. 

"I hope you'll . . ." she started. 
Then she turned her face. 

"What?" 

"Nothing," she said. "We'd 
better go." 

The house was dead quiet as 
we went into the hall. We were 
halfway to the elevator when I 
remembered Phil and Marge. I 
told her. 

"We can't wait," she said. "It'll 
be light soon." 

"I'll just go see if they're up," 
I said. "It won't take a minute.** 

She didn't say anything. She 
stood by the elevator door. I went 
down the hall and knocked quietly on the door of their apartment. 
There was no answer. I glanced 
up the hall. 

She was gone. 

I felt my heart lurch. Even 
though I was sure there was no 
danger in the basement, it scared 
me. 



GALAXY SCI E NCI FICTION 



"Ruth I" I called out and 

headed for the stairs. 

"Wait a second!" I heard Phil 
yell from his door. 

"I can't!" I shouted back, 
charging down. 

When I got to the basement, I 
saw the open elevator door and 
the light streaming out from the 
inside. Empty. 

I looked around for a light 
switch, but there wasn't any. I 
started to move along the dark 
passage as fast as I could. 

"Hon!" I whispered urgently. 
"Ruth, where are you?" 

I found her standing before a 
doorway in the wall. It was open. 

"Now stop acting as if I were 
insane," she said coldly. 

I gaped and felt a hand pressing against my cheek. It was my 
own. 

She was right. There were 
stairs. And it was lighted down 
there. I heard sounds — sounds of 
metallic clickings and strange 
buzzings. 

I took her hand. 

"I'm sorry, baby," I said. "I'm 
very sorry." 

Her hand tightened in mine. 
"Never mind that now. There's 
something queer about all this." 

I nodded. Then I said. "Yeah," 
realizing she couldn't see my nod 

in the darkness. 

"Let's go down," she said. 

"I don't think we better,** I 
argued. 



"We've got to know," she insisted as if the entire problem had 
been assigned to her. 

"But there must be someone 
down there." 

"We'll just peek." 

She pulled me and I guess I 
felt too ashamed of myself to pull 
back. We started down. Then it 
came to me — if she was right 
about the doorway and the engines, she must be right about the 
janitor and he must really 
have . . . 

I felt a rtttle detached from 
reality. East 7th Street, I told 
myself again. An apartment house 
on East 7th Street. It's all real. 

J couldn't quite convince myself. 

We stopped at the bottom and 
just stared. 

Engines, all right. Fantastic 
engines. And, as 1 looked at them, 
their structure, it occurred to me 
what kind of engines they were. 
I'd written some science articles 
and read a lot more. 

I felt dizzy. You can't adapt 
quickly to something like that, to 
be plunged from a stone apartment house basement into this 
. . . this storehouse of energy. 

It got me. 

T DON'T know how much time 
*■ passed, but I finally realized 
we had to get out of there and 
report it. We had to do something. First of all, get out, though. 



 



"'Come on," I said. 

We moved up the steps, my 
mind working like an engine itself, fast and furious, spinning 
out ideas and theories. All of 
them crazy. All of them acceptable. Even the craziest one. 

It was when we were moving 
down the basement hall. 

We saw the janitor coming at 
us. 

It was still dark, even with, the 
little light that was coming from 
the early morning haze. I grabbed 
Ruth and we ducked behind a 
stone pillar. We stood there holdin our breaths, listening to the 
sound of his approaching shoes. 

He passed us. He was holding 
a flashlight, but he didn't play it 
around. He just moved straight 
for the open door. 

As he came into the patch of 
light from the open doorway, he 
stopped. His head was turned 
away. The guy was facing the 
stairway. 

But he was looking at us. 

It knocked out what little 
breath I had left. I just stood 
there and stared at that eye in 
the back of his head. And, although there wasn't any face 
around it, that ghastly eye had 
a smile that went with it. A nasty, 
self -certain and frightening smile. 
He saw us and he was amused 
and didn't have to do a thing 
about it. 

He went through the doorway 



and the door thudded closed behind him and the stone wall segment slid down and shut it from 
view. 

We stood there shivering. 
"You saw it," she finally said. 
"Yes." 

"He knows we saw those engines and still he didn't do anything." 

We went on talking after we 
got in the elevator. 

"Maybe there's nothing really 
wrong," I said, "Maybe . . 

Then I stdpped. I remembered 
those engines. I remembered what 
kind they were. 

"What shall we do?" she asked, 
scared. 

I put my arm around her for 
comfort. But I was scared, too. 

"We'd better get out," I said. 
"Fast." 

"Like this? Without packing?'* 

"We'll get our stuff together 
and leave before morning. I 
don't think they can do . . .** 

"They?" she interrupted. 

Why had I said that? But it 
had to be a group. The janitor couldn't have made or even assembled those engines all by himself. 

I think it was the third eye 
that cemented my theory. And "* 
when we stopped in to see Phil 
and Marge and they asked us 
what happened, I told them what 
I thought. I don't think it surprised Ruth much. She probably 



GALAXY SCIENCf FICTION 



had decided the same herself. 
What I said was: 

"I think the house is a rocket 
ship." 

Phil grinned, then stopped 
when he saw I wasn't trying to 
kid him. 

"What?" Marge asked blankly, 
not getting it at all. 

"I know it sounds crazy," I 
said, sounding more like my wife 
than she did, "but those engines 
are rocket engines. I don't know 
how they ..." I shrugged helplessly at the whole idea. "All I 
know is that they're rocket engines." 

"That doesn't mean it's a — a 
ship?" Phil finished weakly, 
switching from statement to question in mid-sentence. 

"Yes," said Ruth. 

And I shuddered. That seemed 
to settle it. She'd been right too 
often lately. 

"What*s the point?" Marge 
asked. "Why?" 

"If you figure it out," said 
Ruth, "it makes sense." 

WE all turned toward her. 
"How, baby ?" I asked, 
afraid to be asking. 

"That janitor," she said. "He's 
not a man. We know that. That 
third eye makes it a positive fact. 
I mean for sure." 

"You telling me the guy actually has one?" Phil asked incredulously. 



I nodded. "He has one," I said. 
"I saw it." 

"Oh, my God," he said. 

"He's not a man." Ruth repeated. "Humanoid, yes, but not 
from Earth. Except for the eye, 
he might look just about like us. 
But he might be completely different, so different that they'd 
change his form. Give him that 
extra eye just to keep track of us 
when we didn't know he was." 

Phil ran a shaking hand 
through his hair. "This is crazy,'" 
he said. 

He sank down into a chair. So 
did the girls. 

I didn't. I felt uneasy about 
sticking around. I thought we 
should grab our hats and run. 
They didn't seem to fee! in immediate danger. I finally decided it 
wouldn't hurt to wait until morning. Then I 'd tell Johnson or 
somebody. Nothing could happen 
right now. 

"This is crazy," Phil said again. 

"I saw those engines," I stated. 
"They're really there. You can't 
get away from that fact." 

"Listen," Ruth said, "they're 
probably extraterrestrials." 

"What are you talking about?" 
Marge demanded irritably. She 
was good and afraid, I saw. 

"Hon," I contributed weakly, 
**you've been reading too many 
science fiction magazines." 

Her lips drew together. "You 
thought I was crazy when I sus

pected this place. You thought so 
when I told you I saw those engines. You thought so when I 
told you the janitor had fehree 
eyes. Well, I was right every time. 
Now, lay off the imagination business. You need to do some guessing to explain all those things. 
Even you'll admit they don't happen every day — as far as we 
know." 

I shut up. 

"What if they're from another 
planet?" she rephrased, for 
Marge's benefit. "Suppose they 
want some Earth people to experiment on. To observe . . ." she 
amended, though I don't know 
for whose benefit. But the idea of 
being experimented on by threeeyed janitors from another planet 
had something revolting about it. 

"What better way," Ruth was 
saying, "of getting people than to 
build a rocket ship that looks 
like an apartment house, rent it 
out cheap and get it full of people 
fast?" 

She looked at us without yielding an inch. 

"And then," she said, "just wait 
until some morning, early, when 
everybody is asleep and . . . goodby, Earth." 

It was crazy, but I'd been 
shrewdly practical — and wrong — 
three times. I couldn't afford to 
doubt now. It wasn't worth, the 
risk. And I sort of felt she was 
right. 



"But the whole house?" Phil 
was saying. "How could they get 
it ... in the air?" 

"If they're from another planet, 
they're probably centuries ahead 
of us in space travel." 

Phil started to answer. He faltered. Then he said, "But it 
doesn't look like a ship." 

"The house might be a shell 
over the ship," I said. "It probably is. Maybe the ship just includes the bedrooms. That's all 
they'd need. That's where everybody would be in the early morning hours if . . ." 

"No," Ruth said. ''They 
couldn't knock off the shell without attracting too much attention." * 

We were all silent, laboring 
under a thick cloud of confusion 
and half-formed fears. Halfformed because you can't shape 
your fears of something when you 
don't even know what it is. 

"Suppose it is a building," 
Ruth said. "Suppose the ship is 
outside of it." 

Marge was practically lost. She 
got angry because she was lost. 
"There's nothing outside the 
house. That's obvious!" 

"Those people would be way 
ahead of us in science," Ruth 
said. "Maybe they've mastered 
invisibility of matter." 

We all squirmed at once, I 
tlnnk. 

"Babe," I said. 




 



"Is it possible?" Ruth challenged. 

I sighed. "It's possible. I don't 
know what is or isn't any more.'* 

We were quiet. 

"Listen," Ruth said. 

"No," I cut in. "You listen. I 
think maybe we're going overboard on this thing. But there are 
engines in the basement and the 
janitor does have three eyes. On 
the basis of that, I think we have 
enough reason to clear out. Tonight." 

We all agreed on that anyway. 

"We'd better tell everybody in 
the house," Ruth said. "We can't 
leave them here." 

"It'll take too long," Marge argued. 

"No, we have to," I said. "You 
pack, babe. I'll tell them." 

I headed for the door and grabbed the knob. 

It didn't turn. 

A BOLT of panic drove through 
me. I grabbed at it and 
yanked hard. I thought for a 
second, fighting down fear, that 
it was locked on the inside. I 
checked. 

It was locked on the outside. 

Marge was ready to scream. 
You could sense it bubbling up in 
her. 

"It's true," Ruth said, horrified. "Oh, my God, it's all true, 
then!" 

I made a dash for the window. 



The place began to vibrate, as 

if we were about to get hit by an 
earthquake. Dishes started to rattle and fall off their shelves. We 
heard a chair crash onto its side 
in the kitchen. 

"What is it?" Marge cried. 

Phil grabbed for her as she began to whimper. Ruth ran to me 
and we stood there, frozen, feeling the floor shake under our 
feet. 

"The engines!" Ruth suddenly 
screamed. "They're going now/" 

"They have to warm up!" was 
my wild guess. "We can still get 
out!" 

I let go of Ruth and grabbed a 
chair. For some reason I felt that 
the windows would be automatically locked, too. 

I hurled the chair through the 
glass. The vibrations were getting 
worse. 

"Quick !" I shouted over the 
noise. "Out on the fire escapel 
Maybe we can make it!" 

Impelled by panic and dread, 
Marge and Phil came running 
over the shaking floor. I almost 
shoved them out through the 
gaping window hole. Marge tore 
her skirt. Ruth cut her finger. I 
went last, dragged a glass dagger 
through my leg. I didn't even feel 
it, I was so keyed up. 

I kept pushing them, hurrying 
them down the fire escape steps. 
Marge caught a heel in between 
two gratings and her shoe came

off. She half limped, half fell 
down the orange-metal steps, her 
face white and twisted with fear. 
Ruth in her loafers clattered 
down behind Phil. I came last, 
shepherding them frantically. 

We heard windows crashing 
above and below. We saw an 
older couple ahead of us crawl 
out hurriedly and start down. 
They held us up. 

"Look out, will you!" Marge 
shouted at them in a fury. 

They cast a frightened glance 
over their shoulders. 

Ruth looked back at me. "Arc 
you coining?" she asked quickly, 
her voice between a sob and a 
scream. 

"I'm here," I said breathlessly. 
I felt as if I were going to collapse on the steps. 

They seemed to go on forever. 

At the bottom was a ladder. 
We saw the old lady drop from 
it and cry out in pain as her ankle 
twisted under her. Her husband 
climbed down and helped her up. 
The building was vibrating harshly now. We saw dust scaling out 
from between the bricks. 

My voice joined the throng, 
all crying the same word: 
"Harry!" 

I saw Phil drop down. He 
caught Marge, who was sobbing 
in fright. I heard her half-articulate, "Oh, thank God!" as she 
landed. They started up the alleyway. Phil looked back over 



his shoulder at us, but Marge 
dragged him on. 

"Let me go first!" I snapped 
quickly. Ruth stepped aside. I 
swung down the ladder and 
dropped, felt the sting in my insteps, a slight pain in my ankles. 
1 looked up, extended my arms. 

An old man behind Ruth was 
trying to shove her aside so he 
could jump down. 

"Look out ! " I yelled, 1 i ke a 
raging animal, reduced suddenly 
by fear and concern. If I'd had a 
gun, I'd have shot him. 

RUTH let the old man go by. 
He scrambled to his feet, 
breathing feverishly, and ran 
down the alley. The building was 
shaking and trembling. The air 
was filled with the roar of the 
engines now. 

"Ruth!" I yelled. 
She dropped and I caught her. 
We regained our balance and 
started up the alley. I could hardly breathe with that stitch in my 
side. 

As we dashed into the street, 
we saw Johnson moving through 
the ranks of scattered people, trying to herd them together. 

"Here now!" he was calling. 
"Take it easy!" 

We ran up to him. 

"Johnson!" I said, "The ship 
is . . 

"Ship?" He looked blank. 
"The house! It*s a rocket ship I (

It's . . .** The ground shook wildly. 

Johnson turned away to grab 
somebody running past. 

My breath caught. Ruth gasped, 
then threw her hands over her 
face and shrieked in horror. 

Johnson was still looking at us. 
With that third eye. The one that 
had a smile in it. 

"No!" Ruth said. "No!" 

And then the sky, which was 
growing light, grew dark. My 
head snapped around. Women 
were screaming their lungs out in 
terror. I looked in all directions. 

Solid walls were blotting out 
the sky. 

"We can't get out," she said. 
**/r*s the whole block." 

And then the rockets started.
