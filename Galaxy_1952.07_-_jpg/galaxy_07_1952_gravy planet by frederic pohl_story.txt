gravy planet by frederic pohl


IT was a throbbing, strumming inferno, complete with 
red fire and brutish -looking 
attendant devils. It was exactly 
what I would have consigned a 
Taunton copysrnith to. I was 
confused to find myself there. 

The confusion did not last 
long. One of the attendant devils 
shook my shoulder roughly and 
said: "Gimme a hand, sleepy. I 
gotta stow my hammock." My 
head cleared and it was very 
plain that he was simply a lowerclass consumer. 

"Where's this?" I asked him. 
"Did you bring me back to the 
infirmary in Little America?" 

"Jeez, you talk funny," he 
commented. "Gimme a hand, 
will ya?" 

"Certainly not!" I told him. 
"I'm a star class copysrnith." 

He looked at me pityingly, 
said, "Punchy." and went away 
into the strumming, red -lit darkness. 



I stood up, swaying, and grabbed an elbow hurrying past from 
darkness to darkness. "Excuse 
me. Is this a hospital?** 

The man was another consumer, worse -tempered than the first. 
"Leggo my yarm !'* I did. "Ya 
want on sick call, ya wait until 
we land." 

"Land?" 

"Yah, land. Listen, punchy, 
don't ya know what ya signed up 
for?" 

"Signed up? No, I don't. But 
you're being too familiar. I'm. a 
star class copysrnith — " 

"Ah," he said wisely. "I can 
fix ya up. Justa minnit, punchy. 
I'll be right back wit' the stuff.** 

He was, too. "The stuff" was 
a little green capsule. "Only five 
hunnerd. Maybe the last one on 
board. Ya wanta touch down wit' 
the shakes? Nah! This'll straighten ya out fer landing — *' 

"Landing where?" I yelled. **I 
don't want your dope. Just tell 
me where I am and what I'm 
supposed to have signed up for 
and I'll take it from there!" 

He looked at me closely and 
said: "Ya got it bad. A hit in the 
head, maybe? Well, punchy, yer 
in the Number Six Hold of the 
Labor Freighter Thomas R. Maithus. Wind and weather, immaterial. Course, 273 degrees. Speed, 
300; destination, Costa Rica; cargo, slobs like you and me for the 
Chlorella plantations.**

"You're — ** 

"Downgraded," he said savagely, and stared at the green 
capsule in the palm of his hand. 
Abruptly he gulped it and went 
on. "I'm gonna hit the comeback 
trail, though. I'm gonna introduce new and efficient methods 
in the plantations. I'll be a foreman in a week. I'll be works manager in a month. I'll be a director 
in a year. And then I'm gonna 
buy the Cunard Line and plate 
all their rockets with solid gold. 
If -you don't like gold, I'll get 
platinum. If you don't like — " 

I inched away and he didn't 
notice. He kept babbling his hophead litany. It made me glad I'd 
never taken to the stuff. I came 
to a bulkhead and sat down hopelessly, leaning against it. I wanted to get back to New York, find 
out what kind of stunt Runstead 
had pulled and why, get back to 
K;itl)y, and my friendship with 
Jack O'Shea and my big job at 
Fowler Schocken. I had things 
to do. 

One of the red lights said 
Crash Emergency Exit. I thought 
of the hundreds of people jammed in the hold trying to crowd 
out through the door, and shuddered. 

"Excuse me, my friend," somebody said hoarsely to me. "You'd 
better move." He began to throw 
up, and apparently containers 
weren't issued aboard labor 



freighters. I rolled the emergency 

door open and slid through. 

"Well?" growled a Burns Detective Agency guard. 

"I want to see a ship's officer," 
I said. "I'm here by some mistake. My name is Mitchell 
Courtenay. I'm a copysmith with 
the Fowler Schocken Asseciates." 

"Number," he snapped. 

"16-156-187," I told htm, and 
I admit that there was a little 
pride in my voice. You can lose 
money and health and friendship, but they can't take a low 
Social Security number away 
from you . . . 

He was rolling up my sleeve, 
not roughly. The next moment I 
went spinning against the bulkhead with my head rattling from 
a ham-handed slap, "Get back 
between decks!" the guard roared. "Yer not on an excursion and 
I don't like yer funny talk!"' 

I stared incredulously at the 
pit of my elbow. The tattoo read: 
"1304-9974-1416-156-187723." My 
number was buried in it, but the 
inks matched perfectly. The 
style of lettering was very slightly off — not enough for anybody 
to notice but me. 

"Waddaya waiting for?" the 
guard demanded. "You seen yer 
number before, ain't ya?" 

"No," I said evenly, but my 
legs were quivering. I was scared 
— terribly scared. **I never saw 
this number before. It's been tat

tooed around my real number. 
I'm Courtcnay, I tell you. I 
can prove it. I'll pay you — " I 
fumbled in my pockets and found 
no money. I abruptly realized 
that I was wearing a strange and 
shabby suit of Universal apparel. 

"So pay," the guard said impassively. 

"I'll pay you later," I told him. 
**Just get me, to somebody responsible — " 

A natty young flight lieutenant 
in Panagra uniform popped into 
the narrow corridor. "What's going on here?" he asked the guard. 
"The hatchway light's still on. 
Can't you keep order between 
decks? Burns gets a fitness report from us, you know." He ignored me completely. 

"I'm sorry, Mr. Kobler," the 
guard said, saluting and coming 
to a brace. "This man seems to 
be on the stuff. He came out and 
gave me a spiel that he's a star 
class copy smith on board by 
mistake." 

"Look at my number!" I yelled at the lieutenant. 

His face wrinkled as I thrust 
my bared elbow under his nose. 

"That's a high number, fellow. 
What do you expect to prove by 
showing me that?" 

"My real number is 16-156-187. 
See? Before and after that, there's 
a different lettering style! Ifi 
been added to!" 

Holding his breath, the lieu


tenant looked very closely. He 
said : "Urrim. Just barely possible. 
Come with me." The guard 
hastened to open a corridor door 
for us. He looked scared. 

The lieutenant took me 
through a roaring confusion of 
engine rooms to the purser's hatbox-sized office. The purser was 
a sharp-faced gnome who wore 
his Panagra uniform as though 
it were a sack. 

"Show him your number," the 
lieutenant directed me, and 1 I 
did . To the purser he said: 
"What's the story on this man?" 

The purser slipped a reel into 
the reader and cranked it. "13049974-1416-156-187723." he read. 
"Groby, William George; 26; 
bachelor; broken home (father's 
desertion) child; third of five sibs; 
H-H balance, male 1; health, 2.9; 
occupational class 2 for seven 
years; 1.5 for three months; education 9; signed labor contract 
B." He looked up at the flight 
officer. "A very dull profile. Lieutenant. Is there arty special reason why I should be interested in 
this man?" 

"He claims he's a copysmith 
in here by mistake. He says somebody altered his number. And he 
speaks a little above his class." 

"A broken-home child, especially a middle sib from the low 
levels, reads and views incessantly, trying to better himself. 
But you'll notice — 

"That's enough of that," I said 
curtly to the little man. "I'm 
Mitchell Courtenay. I can buy 
you and sell you without straining my petty cash account. I'm 
in charge of the Fowler Schocken 
Associates Venus Section. I want 
you to get New York on the line 
immediately and we'll wind up 
this farce. Now jump, damn you!" 

The flight lieutenant looked 

alarmed and reached for the 
phone, but the purser smiled and 
moved it away from .his hand. 
"Mitchell Courtenay, are you?" 
He took another reel and put 
it in the viewer. "Here we are," 
he said, after a little cranking. 
The lieutenant and I looked. 

K was the front page of the 
New York Times. The first column contained the obituary of 
Mitchell Courtenay, head of 
Fowler Schocken Associates Venus Section. I had been found . 
frozen to death on Starrzelius 
Glacier near Little America. I 
bad been tampering with my 
power pack, and H had failed. I 
read on long after the lieutenant 
had lost interest. Matt Runstead 
was taking over Venus Section. 1 
was a loss to my profession. My 
wife, Dr. Nevin, had refused to be 
interviewed, Fowler Schocken was 
quoted m a ripe eulogy of me. 1 
was a personal friend of Venus 
pioneer Jack O'Shea, who had expressed shock and grief at the 
news. 



The purser said: "I picked that 
up in Capetown. Lieutenant, get 
this silly son of a bitch back between decks, will you, please?" 

The Burns guard was called in. 
He hammerlocked me all the way 
back to Number Six Hold, 
shoved me through the door into 
the red darkness so hard that I 
bounced off somebody. After the 
relatively clear air of the outside, 
the stink was horrible. 

"What did you do?" the human cushion asked amiably, 
picking himself up. 

"I tried to tell them who I am 
. . ." That wasn't going to get me 
anywhere. "What happens next?" 
I asked. 

"We land. We get quarters. 
We go to work. What contract 
are you on?" 

"Labor contract B, they said." 
He whistled. "I guess they really had you, huh?" 

"What do you mean? What's 
it all about?" 

"Oh, you were blind? Punchy? 
Too bad. B contract's five years. 
For refugees, morons and anybody else they can swindle into 
signing up. There's a conduct 
clause. I got offered the B, but I 
told them if that was the best 
they could do, I'd just go out and 
give myself up to Brinks Express. I talked them into an F 
contract — they must have needed help real bad. It's one year 
and I can buy, outside the com

pany stores and privileges like 
that." 

I held my head to keep it from 
exploding. "It can't be such a bad 
place to work," I said. "Country 
life — farming — fresh air and 
sunshine." 

"Um," said the man in an embarrassed way. "It's better, than 
chemicals, I guess. Maybe not so 
good as power-fishing. You'll 
find out soon enough." 

THERE wasn't any landingready signal. We just hit, and 
hit hard. A discharge port opened, letting in blinding tropical 
sunlight. It was agony after the 
murky hold. What swept in with 
it was not country air, but a 
gush of disinfectant aerosol. I 
untangled myself from a knot of 
cursing laborers and flowed with 
the stream toward the port. 

"Hold it, stupid!" said a hardfaced man wearing a plant-protection badge. He threw a number 
plaque on a cord around my 
neck. Everybody got one and 
lined up at a table outside the 
ship. 

It was in the shadow of the 
Chlorella plantation, a towering 
eighty-story structure like office 
"In-and-Out" baskets stacked up 
to the sky. There were mirrored 
louvers at each tier. Surrounding 
the big buildings were acres of 
eye-stabbing glare. I realized that 
these were more mirrored lou


vers to catch the Sun, bounce it 
off other mirrors inside the tiers 
and onto the photosynthesis 
tanks. It was a spectacular 
though not uncommon sight 
from the air. On the ground it 
was plain hell. 

I should have been planning, 
planning. But the, channels of my 
mind were choked by: "From the 
sun-drenched plantations of Costa Rica, tended by the deft hands 
of independent farmers with 
pride in their work, comes the 
juicy-ripe goodness of Chlorella 
Proteins . . ." I had written those 
words. 

"Keep moving!" a plant-protection man bawled. 

I shaded my eyes and shuffled 
ahead as the line moved past the 
table. 

A dark-glassed man at the 
table was asking me: "Name?" 

"Mitchell Court—" 

"That's the one I told you 
about," said the purser's voice. 

"Okay, thanks." To me: "Groby, we've had men try to bug 
out of a B contract before this, 
you know. Are you up on the 
Costa Rican code of business 
law?" 

"Of course not! All I'm trying 
to tell you — " 

"Don't interrupt; you'll be interested. Certain pharmaceuticals may be administered to a 
contract-breaker in an attempt 
to correct his anti-social, anti


 



IIS 



business, anti-sales attitude." He 
looked squarely at me. "I see you 
understand." 

I did. Cerebrin, Twenty years 
being sandpapered, strangled, 
deafened and blinded continuously, wrapped up in one five-second 
dose. I understood, all right. 

"What's y°jJT name . Groby?" 
th< man in the dark glasses asked me. 

"Groby," I said hoarsely. 

"First name? Educational level? H-H balance?** 

"I don't remember. But if 
you'll give t'lem to me on a piece 
of paper, I'll memorize them." 

I heard the purser laugh and 
say: "He'll do." 

"All right. Groby," the man in 
dark glasses said genially. "No 
harm done. Here's your profile 
and assignment. We'll make a 
scum skimmer out of you yet. 
Move on." 

I moved on. A plant protection 
man grabbed my assignment and 
bawled at me: "Skimmers that 
way." 

"That way" was under the bottom tier of the building, into 
light even more blinding, down 
a corridor between evil-smelling, 
shallow tanks, and at last through 
a door into the central pylon of 
the structure. There was a welllit loom which seemed like twilight after the triply reflected 
tropical Sun outside. 

''Skimmer?" said a man. I 



blinked and nodded at him. "I'm 
Mullane, shift assignment." He 
peered at my profile card. "We 
need a skimmer on the 67th tier 
and we need a skimmer on the 
41st tier. Your bunk's going to 
be on the 43rd tier of the pylon. 
Which would you rather work 
on? I ought to mention that we 
don't have elevators for skimmers 
and the other Class 2 people." 

"The 41st-tier job." 

"That's very sensible." He just 
stood there, with seconds ticking 
away. At last he added: "I like 
to see a sensible man act sensible." There was another long 
pause. 

"I haven't any money on me," 
I told him. 

"I'll lend you some. Just sign 
this note and we can settle up on 
payday without any fuss It's 
just a simple assignment of five 
dollars." 

I read the note and signed it. 
I had to look at my profile card 
again; I had forgotten my first 
name. Mullane briskly scrawled 
"41" and his initials on my assignment, and hurried off. 

"I'm Mrs. Honocks, the housing officer," a woman said sweetly to me. "Welcome to the 
Chlorella family, Mr. Groby. I 
hope you'll spend many happy 
years with us. Mr. Mullane told 
you this draft of crumbs — that is, 
the present group of contractees 
— will be housed on the 43rd 



116 




 



tier. It's my job to see that you're 
located with a congenial group of 
fellow-employees." 

Her face reminded me faintly 
of a tarantula as she went on: 
"We have one vacant bunk in 
Dorm Seven. Lots of nice, young 
men in Dorm Seven. It means so 
much to be among one's own 
kind of people — " 

I got what she was driving at 
and told her I didn't want to be 
in Dorm Seven. 

She went on brightly: "Then 
there's Dorm Twelve. It's a rather rough crowd, I'm afraid, but 
you could carry a knife or something. Shall I put you down for 
Dorm Twelve, Mr. Groby?" 

"What else have you got? And 
by the way, I wonder if you could 
lend me five dollars until payday." 

"I'll put you down for Dorm 
Ten," she said, scribbling. "And 
of course I'll lend you some money. Ten dollars? Just sign and 
thumbprint this assignment, Mr, 
Groby. Thank you." She hurried 
off in search of the next sucker. 

A red-faced fat man gripped 
my hand. "Brother, I want to 
welcome you to the ranks of the 
United Slime-Mold Protein 
Workers of Panamerica. Una/filiated, Chlorella Costa Rica Local. 
This pamphlet will explain how 
the U. S. M. P. W. P. protects 
workers in the field from the innumable petty rackets and abuses 



that useta plague the innustry. 

Yer dues are checked off automatically, but this valable pamphlet is an extra." 

"What's the worst that can 
happen to me if I don't buy it?" 

"It's a long drop to the 
ground," he explained. 

He lent me five dollars to buy 
the pamphlet. 

I DIDN'T have to climb to 
Dorm Ten on the 43rd tier; 
there was an endless cargo net 
we could grab hold of. It took 
daring to jump on and off, and 
clearance was negligible. With 
my motion-sickness, the ride was 
torture, but I made it. 

The dorm was jammed with 
about sixty bunks, three high. 
Since production went on only 
during the daylight hours, the 
hot-bed system wasn't in use. My 
bunk was all mine, twenty-four 
hours a day. Big deal. 

A sour-faced old man was 
sweeping the central aisle lackadaisically when I came in. "You 
a new crumb?" he asked, and 
looked at my ticket. "There's 
your bunk. I'm Pine. Room orderly. You know how to skim?" 

"No," I said. "Look, Mr. Pine, 
how do I make a phone call out 
of here?" 

"Dayroom." he said, jerkins 
his thumb at the room adjoining. 

There was a phone and a biggish hypnoteleset and readers 



 



It? 



and spools and magazines. I 
ground my teeth as the cover of 
Taunton's Weekly sparkled at 
me from the rack. The phone was 
a pay phone, of course. 

1 dashed back into the dorm. 
"Mr. Pine," I said, "can you 
lend me about twenty dollars? I 
have to make a long-distance 
call." 

"Twenty-five for twenty?" 

"Sure. Anything you say." 

He scrawled out an assignment 
slip and I signed and thumbed 
it. Then he carefully counted out 
the money from his baggy pockets and handed it to me. 

I wanted to call Kathy, but 
didn't dare. She might be at her 
apartment, the hospital or in between, and I might miss her. I 
dialed the fifteen digits of the 
Fowler Schocken Associates number after I deposited a clanging 
stream of coins. I waited for the 
switchboard to say: "Fowler 
Schocken Associates, good afternoon; it's always a good afternoon for Fowler Schocken Associates and their clients. May I 
help you?" 

But that isn't what I heard. 
The phone said : "Su numero de 
prioridad, por favor? 1 " 

Priority number for long-distance calls. I didn't have one. A 
firm had to be rated over a billion and fast pay before it could 
get a long-distance priority number in four figures. So expanded 



were the world's long lines that 
an individual priority in any 
number of figures was unthinkable. Naturally, that had never 
worried me when I made longdistance calls from Fowler 
Schocken. A priority number was 
one of the little luxuries I'd have 




1)8 




 



to learn to live without. 

I hung up slowly. 

I could write to everybody — 
Kathy and Jack O'Shea and 
Fowler and Collier and Hester 
and Tildy. Leave no stone unturned. "Dear Wife (or Boss) : 
This is to advise you that your 
husband (or employee) is not 
really dead, but inexplicably a 
contract laborer for Costa Rican 
Chlorella and please drop everything and get him out. Signed, 
your loving husband (or employee), Mitchell Courtenay." 

But there was the company 
censor to think of. And cerebrin. 

I wandered blankly back into 
the dorm. The rest of the Dorm 
Ten people were beginning to 
drift in. 

"A crumb!" one of them yelled, 



sighting me. 

"Court's called to order!" another one trumpeted. 

I don't hold what followed 
against any of them. It was traditional, a break in the monotony, something they had all gone 
through themselves. In Dorm 
Seven, it would have been a 
memorably nasty experience, and 
in Dorm Twelve I might not 
have lived through it. Dorm Ten 
was just high-spirited. I paid my 
"fine" — more pay vouchers — 
and took my lumps and recited 
the blasphemous oath and then 
I was a full-fledged member. 

I didn't troop with them to the 
mess hall for dinner. I just lay 
on my bunk and wished I were 
as dead as the rest of the world 
thought I was.

VIII 

SCUM-SKIMMING was not 
hard to learn. You got up at 
dawn, gulped a breakfast sliced 
not long ago from Chicken Little and washed it down with 
Cofficst, then put on your coveralls and took the cargo net up 
to your tier. In blazing noon, 
from sunrise to sunset, you 
walked slowly and every thirty 
seconds or so you spotted a 
patch at maturity, bursting with 
yummy carbohydrates. You 
scooped up the patch with your 
skimmer and slung it down the 
well, where it would be baled, 
or processed into glucose to feed 
Chicken Little, who would be 
sliced and packed to feed people 
from Bafrinland to Little America. Every hour you could drink 
from your canteen and take a 
salt tablet. Every two hours you 
could take five minutes. At sunset you turned in your coveralls 
and went to dinner — more slices 
from Chicken Little — and then 
you were on your own. 

You could talk, you could read, 
you could go into trance before 
the dayroom hypnoteleset, you 
could buy things, you could pick 
fights, you could drive yourself 
crazy thinking of what you might 
have been, or you could go to 
sleep. 

Mostly you went to sleep. 
Payday came as a surprise. I 



didn't know two weeks had 
slipped by. It left me owing 
Chlorella Proteins only eightyodd dollars and a few cents. Besides the various assignments I 
had made, there were the Employee Welfare Fund; union dues 
and installment on the initiation 
fee; withholding tax; hospitalization (but try and get it. the 
older men said); and old age 
insurance. 

One of the things I consoled 
myself with was the thought that 
when — when, I always said 
firmly — I got out, I'd be closer 
to the consumers than any ad 
man in the profession. Of course, 
at Fowler Schocken, we'd had 
our boys up from the ranks. I 
knew now that they had been 
afraid to give me the straight 
facts on consumers* lives and 
thoughts, or hadn't cared to 
admit them even to themselves. 

I learned that ads work more 
strongly on the unconscious than 
even we had thought. I was 
shocked repeatedly to hear advertising ■ referred to as "that 
bull." I was at first puzzled and 
then gratified to see it sink in and 
take effect anyway. 

The Venus-rocket response was 
naturally my greatest interest. 
For one week I listened when I 
could to enthusiasm growing 
among those men who would 
never go to Venus, who knew 
nobody who would ever go to 



120 




 



Venus. I heard the limericks we 
had launched from Fowler 
Schocken Associates chuckled 
over, with their engineered-ih 
message: that living on Venus 
increased male potency. 

Ben Winston's sub-section on 
Folkways, I had always said, was 
one of the most important talent 
groups in the whole Schocken enterprise. They were particularly 
fine on riddles: "Why do they 
call Venus the Mourning Star?" 
for instance. Well, it doesn't make 
sense in print; but the pun is 
basic humor, and the basic drive 
of the human race is sex. And 
what is more essential than to 
channel the deepest torrential 
flow of human emotion into its 
proper directions? (I am not 
apologizing for those renegades 
who talk fancifully about the 
"Death Wish" to hook their sales 
appeals to. I leave that sort of 
thing to the Tauntons of our profession; it's dirty, it's immoral, 
I want nothing to do with it. Besides, it leads to fewer consumers 
in the long run, if they'd only 
think the thing through.) 

For there is no doubt that linking a sales message to one of the 
great prime motivations of the 
human spirit does more than sell 
goods; it strengthens the motivation, helps it come to the surface, 
provides it with focus. And thus 
we are assured of the steady annual increment of consumers so 



essential to expansion. 

Chlorella, I was pleased to 
learn, took extremely good care 
of its workers' welfare in that respect. There was an adequate 
hormone component in the diet, 
and a splendid thousand-bed 
Recreation Room on the 50th 
Tier. The only stipulation the 
company made was that children 
born on the plantation were automatically indentured to Chlorella 
if either parent was still an employee on the child's tenth birthday. 

But I had no time for the 
Recreation Room. I was learning 
the ropes, studying my environment, waiting for opportunity to 
come. If opportunity didn't come 
soon, I would make one; but first 
I had to study and learn. 

Meanwhile, I kept my ears 
open for the results of the Venus 
campaign. It went beautifully — for a while. The limericks, the 
planted magazine stories, the gay 
little songs had their effect. 

Then something went sour. The 
word "Venus" drifted out of the 
small talk. When the space 
rocket was mentioned, it was in 
connection with reference points 
like "radiation poisoning," 
"taxes," "sacrifice." There was a 
new, dangerous kind of Folkways 
material — "Didja hear the one 
about the punchy that got caught 
in his spacesuit?" 

You might not have recognized 



 



121 



what was going on, and Fowler 
Schocken, scanning his daily precis of the summary of the digests 
of the skeletonized reports of the 
abstracts of the charts of progress 
on Venus Project, would never 
have the chance to question what 
was told him. But I knew Venus 
Project and I knew what was 
happening. 

Matt Runstead had taken over. 

rpHE aristocrat of Dorm Ten 
was Herrera. After ten years 
with Chlorella, he had worked his 
way up — topographically, it was 
down — to Master Slicer. He 
worked in the great, cool vault 
underground where Chicken Little grew and was cropped by him 
and other artisans. He swung a 
sort of two-handed sword that 
carved off great slabs of the tissue, leaving it to the packers and 
trimmers and their helpers to 
weigh it, shape it, freeze it, cook 
it. flavor it, package it and ship 
it off to the area on quota for the 
day. 

He had more than a production job: he was a safety valve. 
Chicken Little grew and grew, as 
she had been growing for decades. Since she had started as a 
lump of poultry tissue, she didn't 
know any better than to grow 
and fill her concrete vault and 
keep growing, compressing her 
cells and rupturing them. As long 
as she got nutrient, she grew. 



Herrera saw to it that she grew 
round and plump, that no tissue 
got old and tough before it was 
sliced, that one side was not neglected for the other. 

With this responsibility went 
commensurate pay, and yet Herrera had not taken a wife or an 
apartment in one of the upper 
tiers of the pylon. He made trips 
that were the subject of bawdy 
debate while he was gone — and 
which were never referred to 
without careful politeness while 
he was present. He kept his twohanded slicer by him at all times, 
and often idly sleeked its edge 
with a hone. He was a man I had 
to know. He was a man with 
money — he must have money 
after ten years — and I needed it. 

The pattern of the B labor contract had become quite clear: you 
never got out of debt. Easy credit 
was part of the system, and so 
were irritants that forced you to 
exercise it. If I fell behind ten 
dollars a week, I would owe 
$1,100 to Chlorella at the end of 
my contract, and would have to 
work until the debt was wiped 
out. And while working, a new 
debt would accumulate. 

I needed Herrera's money to 
buy my way out of Chlorella and 
back to New York: Kathy, my 
wife; Venus Section, my job. 
Runstead was doing things I 
didn't like to Venus Section. And 
God alone knew what Kathy was 



122 




 



doing, under the impression that 
she was a widow. 

I tried not to think of Jack 
O'Shea and Kathy. The little 
man had been getting back at 
women for their years of contempt. Until the age of twentyfive, he had been a laughable 
sixty-pound midget, with a touch 
of grotesquerie in the fact that 
he had doggedly made himself a 
test pilot. At the age of twentysix, he found himself the world's 
foremost celebrity, the first man 
to land a ship on Venus. The 
story was that he'd been setting 
amatory records on his lecture 
tours. I didn't like the story. I 
didn't like the way he liked 
Kathy or the way Kathy liked 
him. 

AND I went through another 
day, up at dawn, breakfast, 
coveralls and goggles, cargo net, 
skimming and slinging for blazing hour after hour, dinner and 
the dayroom and, if I could manage it, a chat with Herrera. 

"Fine edge on that slicer, Gus. 
There's only two kinds of people 
in the world — the ones who don't 
take care of their tools and the 
smart ones." 

Suspicious look from under his 
Aztec brows. "Pays to do things 
right. You're the crumb, ain't 
you?" 

"Yeah. First time here. Think 
I ought to stay?" 



"You gotta stay. Contract.** 
And he went to the magazine 
rack. 

Tomorrow's another day. 

"Hello, Gus. Tired?" 

"Hi, George. Yeah, a little. Ten 
hours swinging the slicer. It gets 
you in the arms." 

"I can imagine. Skimming's 
easy, but you don't need brains 
for it." 

"Well, maybe some day you 
get upgraded. I think I'll trance 
for a while." 

And another: 

"Hi, George. How's it going?" 

"Can't complain, Gus. At least 
I'm getting a suntan." 

"You sure are. Soon you be 
dark like me. Haw-haw! You 
pass for an Indian. How'd you 
like that?" ' 

"Porque no, amigo?" 

"Hey, tu hablas espanol! Cuando aprendes la lengua?" 

"Not so fast, Gus! Just a few 
words here and there. I wish I 
knew more. Some day, when I get 
a few bucks ahead, I'm going to 
town and see the girls." 

"Oh, they all speak English, 
kind of. If you get a nice steady 
girl, it would be nice to speak a 
little Spanish. She would appreciate it. But most of them know 
'Gimme-gimme' and the English 
poem about what you get for one 
buck. Haw-haw!" 

And another day — an astonishing day. 



 



12S 



T*D been paid again, and my 

debt increased by eight dollars. I'd tormented myself by 
wondering where the money 
went, but I knew. 

I came off shift dehydrated, as 
they wanted me to be. I got a 
squirt of Popsie from the fountain by punching my combination — twenty-five cents checked 
off my payroll. The squirt wasn't 
quite enough, so I had another — 
fifty cents. Dinner was drab, as 
usual; I couldn't face more than 
a bite or two of Chicken Little. 
Later I was hungry and there 
was the canteen where I got 
Crunchies on easy credit. The 
Crunchies kicked off withdrawal 
symptoms that could be quelled 
only by another two squirts of 
Popsie from the fountain. And 
Popsie kicked off withdrawal 
symptoms that could only be 
quelled by smoking Starr cigarettes, which made you hungry for 
Crunchies . . . 

Had Fowler Schocken thought 
of it in these terms when he organized Starrzelius Verily, the 
first spherical trust? Popsie to 
Crunchies to Starrs to Popsie? 

And you paid six per cent interest on the money advanced 
you. 

If I didn't get out soon, I never 
would. I could feel my initiative 
dying, cell by cell, within me. 
The minute dosages of alkaloid 
were sapping my will, but most 



of all it was a hopeless, trapped 
feeling that things would always 
be this way, that it wasn't too 
bad, that you could go into a 
trance or get really lit on Popsie 
or maybe try one of the green 
capsules that floated around from 
hand to hand at varying quotations; the boys would be glad to 
wait for the money. 

It had to be soon. 

u Como 'sta, Gustavo?" 

He sat down and gave me his 
A2tec grin. "Se fumar?" He extended a pack of cigarettes. 

They were Greentips. I said 
automatically : "No, thanks. I 
smoke Starrs; they're tastier." 
And automatically I lit one, of 
course. "I don't feel so happy, 
amigo." This was it. "I'm in a 
very strange situation." Wait for 
him now. 

"I figured there was something 
wrong. An intelligent fellow like 
you, a fellow who's been around. 
Maybe you can use some help?" 

Wonderful; wonderful. "You 
won't lose by it, Gus. You're 
taking a chance, but you won't 
lose by it. Here's the story — " 

"Sst! Not here!" he shushed me. 
In a lower voice he went on: "It's 
always a risk. It's always worth 
it when I see a smart young fellow wise up and begin to do 
things. Some day I make a mistake, seguro. Then they get me, 
maybe they brainburn me. What 
the hell, I can laugh at them. I 




 



done my part. Here. I don't have 
to tell you to be careful where 
you open this." 

He shook my hand and I felt 
a wad of something adhere to my 
palm. Then he strolled across the 
dayroom to the hypnoteleset, 
punched his clock number for a 
half-hour trance and slid under, 
with the rest of the viewers. 

T WENT to the washroom and 
punched my combination for 
a ten-minute occupancy of a 
booth — bang went another dime 
off my pay — and went in. The 
adhesive wad on my palm 
opened up into a single sheet of 
tissue paper which said : 

A LIFE IS IN YOUR HANDS 

This is Contact Sheet One of the 
World Conservationist Association, 
generally known as "the Connies." It 
has been passed to you by a member of 
the W.C.A. who judged that you are 
(a) intelligent; (b) disturbed by the 
present state of the world; (c) a potentially valuable addition to our 
ranks. His life is now in your hands. 
We ask you to read on "before you 
take any action. 

Facts Aboul The W.C.A. 

The W.C.A. is a secret organization 
persecuted by all the governments of 
the world. It believes that reckless exploitation of natural resources has created needless poverty and needless 
human misery. It believes that continued exploitation will mean the end 
of human life on Earth. It believes that 
this trend may be reversed if the people of the Earth can be educated to 
the point where they will demand 
planning of population, reforestation, 
soil-building, de- urbanization and an 



end to the wasteful production of 
gadgets and proprietary foods for 
which there is no natural demand. This 
educational program is being carried 
on by propaganda like this, by demonstrations of force and sabotage of factories which produce trivia. 

Falsehoods Aboul The W.C.A. 

You have probably heard that "the 
Connies" are murderers, psychotics and 
incompetent people who kill and destroy for irrational ends or out of envy. 
None of this is true. W.C.A. members 
are humane, balanced persons, many 
of them successful in the eyes of the 
world. There are irrational, unbalanced 
and criminal persons who do commit 
outrages in the name of conservation, 
either idealistically or as a shield for 
looting. The W.C.A. dissociates itself 
from such people and regards their activities with repugnance. 

What Will You Do Next? 

That is up to you. You can (a) denounce the person who passed you 
this contact sheet; (b) destroy this 
sheet and forget about it; (c) go to 
the person who passed you the sheet 
and seek further information. 

We ask you to think before you act, 

I thought — hard. I thought the 
broadside was (a) the dullest, 
lousiest piece of copysmithing I 
had ever seen in my life; (b) a 
wildly distorted version of reality; (c) a possible escape route 
for me out of Chlorella and back 
to Kathy. 

So these were the dreaded Connies! Of all the self- contradictory 
gibberish — yet it had a certain 
appeal. The ad was crafted — unconsciously, I was sure — the way 
we'd do a pharmaceutical booklet for doctors only. Calm, 
learned, we're all men of sound 



 



125 



judgment and deep scholarship 
here. 

It was an appeal to reason, and 
that's always dangerous. You 
can't trust reason. We threw it 
out of the ad profession long ago 
and have never missed it. 

Well, there were obviously two 
ways to do it. I could go to the 
front office and put the finger on 
Herrera. I'd get a little publicity, 
maybe ; they'd listen to me, 
maybe; they would certainly believe enough of what I told them 
to check. I seemed to recall that 
denouncers of Connies were sometimes brainburned on the sensible 
grounds that they had been exposed to the virus. 

Riskier, but more heroic: I 
could bore from within, playing 
along with the Connies. If they 
were the worldwide net they 
claimed to be, I might be able to 
reach Kathy and Fowler Schocken through them — I was smart 
enough to use them without 
being used. 

HPHE door of the booth sprang 
open; my ten minutes were 
Up. I hastily flushed the contact 
sheet down the drain and went 
out into the dayroom. Herrera 
was stUl in the trance before the 
«et. 

Finally he shook himself, 
blinked and looked around. He 
saw me and his face was granite. 
I smiled and nodded, and he came 



over. "AH right, companero?" he 
asked quietly. 

"All right," I said. "Any time 
you say, Gus." 

"Always, after a thing like that, 
I plug in for some trance. I cannot stand the suspense of waiting 
to find out. Some day I come up 
out of trance and find the bulls 
are beating hell out of me, eh?" 
He began to sleek the edge of his 
sheer with the pocket hone. 
- I looked at it with new understanding. "For the bulls?" I 
asked. 

His face was shocked. "You 
have the wrong idea a little. For 
me. So I have no chance to rat." 

I hated the twisted minds that 
had done such a thing to a fine 
consumer like Gus. It was something like murder. He could have 
played his part in the world, buying and using and making work 
and profits for his brothers all 
around the globe, ever increasing 
his wants and needs, ever increasing everybody's work and profits 
in the circle of consumption, raising children to be consumers in 
turn. It hurt to see him perverted 
into a sterile zealot. 

Surely there must be some sort 
of remedial treatment for Connies like Gus who were only 
dupes. It was the people who had 
soured him on the world who 
should pay. I would ask — no, it 
would be better not to. People 
would jump to conclusions : 




 



"Once a Connie, always a Connie." "Everybody knows that. I 
don't say Mitch isn't sound, mind 
you, but — " 

The hell with Herrera. Anyone 
who sets out to turn the world 
upside down has no right to 
squawk if he gets caught in its 
gears. 

IX 

TAAYS went by like weeks. Herrera talked little to me, until, 
one evening in the dayroom, he 
suddenly asked : "You ever see 
Gallina?" That was Chicken Little. I said no. "Come on down, 
then. I can get you in. She is 
something to see." 

We walked through corridors 
and leaped for the descending 
cargo net. I resolutely shut my 
eyes. You look straight down that 
tiling and you get the high-sky 
horrors. Tier Forty, Thirty, 
Twenty, Ten, Zero, Minus Ten — 

"Jump off," Herrera said. "Below Minus Ten is the machinery." 

I jumped. 

Minus Ten was gloomy and 
sweated water from its concrete 
walls. "The roof was supported by 
immense beams. A tangle of pipes 
jammed the -corridor where we 
got off. 

"Nutrient fluid," Herrera explained. 

I asked about the apparently 
immense weight of the ceiling. 



"Concrete and lead. It shields 
cosmic rays. Sometimes a Gallina 
goes cancer." He spat. "No good 
to eat for people. You got to burn 
it all if you don't catch it real 
fast — " He swung his glittering 
slicer in a screaming arc to show 
me what he meant by "catch." 

He swung open a door. "This 
is her nest," he said proudly. I 
looked and gulped. 

It was a great concrete dome. 
Chicken Little filled most of it. 
She was a gray-brown, rubbery 
hemisphere towering over and 
away from us, as huge as a hypnomovie palace. Dozens of pipes 
ran into her. You could see that 
she was alive. 

Herrera said to me: "All day 
I walk around her. I see a part 
growing fast, it looks good and 
tender, I slice." His two-handed 
blade shaved off an inch-thick 
Chicken Little steak. "Crumbs 
behind me hook it away and cut 
it up and put it on the conveyor." 
There were tunnel openings 
spotted around the circumference 
of the dome, with idle conveyor 
belts visible in them. 

"Doesn't she grow at night?" 

"No. They turn down the nutrient just enough, they let the 
waste run off. Each night she 
almost dies. Each morning she 
comes to life like Santo Lazaro. 
But nobody ever pray before 
pobrecita jGallina, hey?" He 
whacked the rubbery thing af


 



fectionately with the flat of his 
slice r. 

"You like her," I said inanely. 

"Sure. She does tricks for me." 
He looked around and then 
marched the circuit of the nest, 
peering into each of the tunnel 
mouths. Then he took a short 



beam from one of them and casually braced it against the door to 
the nest. It fitted against a crossbar on the door and against a 
seemingly random groove in the 
concrete floor. It would do very 
well as a lock. 

"I'll show you the trick." He 





 



took out a sort of whistle. Instead of a mouthpiece, it had an 
air tank fed by a small hand 
pump. "They call it Galton's 
whistle, but who this Galton is, 
I don't know. Watch - — and 
listen." 

He began working the pump, 




pointing the whistle purposefully 
at Chicken Little. I heard no 
sound, but I shuddered as the 
rubbery protoplasm bulged away 
from the pipe in a hemispherical 
depression. 

"Don't be scared, companero," 
he told me. "Just follow." He 
passed me a flashlight which I 
stupidly turned on. Pumping 
hard, Herrera played the soundless blast of the whistle against 
Chicken Little like a hose. She 
reacted with a bigger and bigger 
cavity that finally became an 
archway over the concrete floor' 
of the nest. Herrera walked into 
the archway, saying : "Follow." 
I did, my heart pounding frightfully. He inched forward, pumping the whistle, and the archway 
became a dome. The entrance 
into Chicken Little behind us became smaller . . . smaller . . . 

We were inside a hemispherical 
bubble moving slowly through a 
giant lump of gray-brown, rubbery flesh. "Light on the floor," 
he said, and I flashed it there. 
The concrete was marked with 
lines that looked accidental, but 
which guided Herrera's feet. 

After endless inch - by - inch 
progress, I flashed my light on a 
crescent of metal. Herrera piped 
the bubble over it, and it became 
a disk. Still pumping/he stamped 
three times and it flipped open 
like a manhole. "You first." he 
said, and I dived down, not know


GRAVY P L A 



\7t 



ing or caring whether the landing 
would be hard or soft. It was 
soft, and I lay there, shuddering. 
A moment later Herrera landed 
beside me and the manhole above 
clapped shut. He stood up, 
massaging his arm. 

"Hard work," he said. "I pump 
and pump that thing and I don't 
hear it. Some day it's going to 
stop working and I won't know 
the difference until — " He grinned 
again. 

TJERRERA introduced me. 
M.M. "This is Ronnie Bowan." He 
was a short, phlegmatic consumer 
in a front-office suit. "And this 
is Arturo Denzer." Denzer was 
very young and nervous. 

The place was a well-lighted 
little office, all concrete, with air 
regenerators. There were desks 
and communication equipment. 
It was hard to believe that the 
only way to get in was barred 
by that mountain of protoplasm 
above. It was harder to believe 
that the squeak of inaudibly highfrequency sound waves could 
goad that insensate hulk into 
moving aside. 

"Pleased to have you with us. 
Grohy," Bowen said. "Herrera 
says you, have brains. We don't 
go in for a great deal of red tape, 
but I want your profile." 

I gave him Groby's profile and 
he took it down. His mouth tightened with suspicion as I told him 



the low educational level. "You 
don't talk like an uneducated 
man." 

"You know how some kids are," 
I said. "I spent my time reading 
and viewing. It's tough being 
right in the middle of a family 
of five. You aren't old enough to 
be respected and you aren't young 
enough to be the pet. ! felt kind 
of lost and I kept trying to better myself." 

"Fair enough. Now, what can 
you do?" 

"Well. I think I can write a 
better contact sheet than you 
use." 

"Indeed. What else?" 

"Well, propaganda generally. 
Things to make people feel discontented and wake them up." 

"Give me an example." 

My brain was chugging nicely. 
"Start a rumor going around that 
they've got a way of making new 
protein and you'll be able to buy 
it at a dollar a pound. Say it's 
going to be announced in three 
days. Then when the three days 
are up and there's no announcement, start a wisecrack going. 
Something like that catches on 
and it'll make them think about 
the old days favorably." 

It was easy. This wasn't the 
first time I'd turned my talent 
to backing a product I didn't 
care for personally. 

Bowen was taking it down on 
a silenced typewriter. "Good," he 




 



said. "We'll try that Why do you 
say three days?" 

I couldn't very well tell him 
that three days was the optimum 
priming period for a closed social 
circuit to be triggered with a catalytic cue-phrase, which was the 
book answer. I said instead, with 
embarrassment: "It seemed about 
right to me." 

"Well, we'll see if it works. 
Now, Groby, you're going to have 
a study period. We've got the 
classic conservationist texts, and 
you should read them. We've got 
special publications of interest to 
us which you should follow: Statistical Abstracts, Journal of 
Space Flight, Biometrika, Agricultural Bulletin and lots more. 
If you run into tough going, and 
I expect you will, ask for help. 
Eventually you should pick a 
subject to which you're attracted 
and specialize in it, with an eye 
to research. An informed conservationist is an effective conservationist." 

"Why the Journal of Space 
Flight?" I asked, with a growing 
excitement. Suddenly there 
seemed to be an answer: Runstead's sabotage, my kidnaping, 
the infinite delays and breakdowns in the project. Could the 
Connies, in their depraved, illogical minds, have decided that 
space travel was anti- survival, or 
whatever you called it? 

"Very important," said Bowen. 

 



"You need to fenow all you can 

about it." 

"So we can louse it up?" 

"Good God, think what Venus 
means to us — an unspoiled planet, all the wealth the race needs, 
all the fields and food and raw 
materials! Use your head, man!" 

"Oh," I said, watching my theory evaporate. 

I CURLED up with the reels of 
Biometrika and every once in 
a while asked for an enplanation 
I didn't need. Biometrika was one 
of the everyday tools of a copysmith. It holds the story of population changes, IQ changes, 
death-rate and causes of death 
and all the rest of it. Almost 
every issue had good news in it 
for us — the same news that these 
Connies clucked over. Increase of 
population , was always good 
news to us. More people, more 
sales. Decrease of IQ was always 
good news to us. Less brains, 
more sales. But these eccentrically oriented fanatics couldn't 
see it that way and I had to pretend to go along with them. 

I switched to the Journal of 
Space Ffsght after a while. The 
news was bad — all bad. There 
was public apathy, sullen resistance to the shortages that the 
Venus rocket construction entailed, defeatism about planting 
a Venus colony at all, doubt that 
the colony could do anything if 

131 



it ever did get planted. 

That lousy Runsteadt 

But the worst news of all was 
on the cover of the latest issue. 
The cutline said: "Jack O'Shea 
Grins as Pretty Friend Congratulates with Kiss after President 
Awards Medal of Honor," The 
pretty friend was my wife Kathy. 

I got behind the Connie cell 
then and pushed. In three days 
there was a kind of bubbling discontent about the chow. In a 
week the consumers were saying 
things like: "I wish to hell I 
was born a hundred years ago . . . 
I wish to hell this Dorm wasn't so 
damned crowded . . . E wish to 
hell I could get out on a piece of 
land somewhere and work for 
myself." 

The cell was elated. Apparently 
1 had done more in a week than 
they had done in a year. Bowen 

— he was stationed in Personnel 

— told me: "We need a head like 
yours, Groby. You're not going 
to sweat your life away as a 
scum-skimmer. One of these days 
the assignment boss will ask you 
if you know nutrient chemistry. 
Tell him yes. I'll give you a 
quickie course in everything you 
need to know." 

It happened in another week, 
when everybody was saying 
things like: "Be nice to walk in 
a forest some day. Can y'imagine 
all those trees they useta have?" 
and : "This stinking salt-water 



*oap!" when it had never occurred to them to think of it as 
"salt-water soap." The assignment boss came up to me and 
duly said : "Groby, you know any 
nutrient chemistry?" 

"Funny you should ask." I 
told him. "I've studied it quite a 
bit. I know the sulfur-phosphorus-carbon-oxygen-hydrogen-nitrogen ratios for chlorella, and I 
know the optimum temperatures 
and stuff like that." 

Obviously this little was more 
than he knew. He grunted, 
"Yeah?" and went away, impressed. 

A week later everybody was 
telling a dirty joke about the 
Starrzelius Verily trust and I 
was transferred to an eight-hour 
job inside the pylon, reading 
gauges and twisting valves that 
controlled the nutrient flow to the 
tanks of chlorella. It was lighter 
and easier work. I spent my time 
under Chicken Little — I could 
pass through her with a Galton 
whistle almost without cringing — rewriting the Connies* fantastically inept Contact Sheet 
One: 

CAN YOU QUALIFY FOR 
TOP-LEVEL PROMOTION?

to every one of those questions, please 

read no further! 

But if you can, then you and your 
friends or family can get in on the 
ground ttoor of. . . . 

And so on. 

Bowen was worried. "You 
don't think that appeal to upperlevel IQs limits it too much, do 
you?" he asked anxiously. 

I didn't tell him that the only 
difference between that and the 
standard come-on for Class 12 
laborers was that Class 12s got 
it aurally — they couldn't read. 
I said I didn't think so. 

He nodded. "You're a naturalborn copysmith, Groby," he told 
me solemnly. "In a Conservationist America, you'd be star 
class." 

I was properly modest. 

He went on, "I can't hog you; 
I've got to pass you on to a 
higher echelon. It isn't right to 
waste your talents in a cell. I've 
forwarded a report on you — he 
gestured at the communicator — 
"and I expect you'll be requisitioned. I hate to see you go, but 
I'm pulling the strings already. 
Here's the Chlorella Purchaser's 
Handbook . . ." 

My heart.bounded. I knew that 
Ghlorella contracted for raw materials in New York City. 

"Thanks/' . I mumbled. "1 want 
to serve! wherever I can."* 



"I know you do, Groby. Uh — 
one thing before you go. This 
isn't official, George, but — well, 
I do a little writing, too. I've got 
some of my things here — 
sketches, I guess you'd call them 
— and I'd appreciate it a lot if 
you'd take them along and . . 

I finally got out with the harjdbook and only fourteen of Bowen's "sketches." They were 
churlish little scraps of writing, 
with no sale in them at all that 
I could see. Bowen assured me he 
had lots more that he and I could 
work on. 

I hit that handbook hard. 

rpWISTING valves left me freling more alive at the end of 
a day than scum -skimming, and 
Bowen made sure my Connie 
labors were as light as possible — ■ 
to f.».e me for work on his 
"sketches." The result was that, 
for the first time, I had leisure to 
explore. Herrera took me into 
town with him once, and I discovered what he did with those 
unmentioned weekends. The 
knowledge shocked and yet did 
not disgust me. If anything, it 
reminded me that the gap between the executive and consumer 
could not be bridged by anything 
as abstract and unreal as "friendship 1 ." 

Stepping out of the old-fashioned pneumatic tube into a 
Costa Rican drizzle, we stopped 



 



133 



at a third-rate restaurant for a 
meal. 

Herrera insisted on getting us 
each a potato and being allowed 
to pay for it — "No, call it a 
celebration. You let me go on 
living after I gave you the contact sheet, no? So we celebrate." 

He was brilliant through the 
meal, a fountain of conversation 
and bilingual badinage with me 
and the waiters. The sparkle in 
his eye, the rapid, compulsive 
flow of speech, the easy, unnecessary laughter were like nothing 
so much as the gaiety of a young 
man on a date. I remembered my 
first meeting with Kathy, that 
long afternoon at Central Park, 
strolling hand in hand down the 
dim-lit corridors, the dance hall, 
the eternal hour we stood outside 
her door . . . 

Herrera reached over and 
pounded me on the shoulder, and 
I saw that he and the waiter were 
laughing. I laughed, too, defensively, and their laughter doubled; evidently the joke had been 
©n me. 

"Never mind," said Herrera, 
sobering; "we go now. You will 
like what I have for us to do in 
back, I think." 

He paid the check and we 
threaded our way between the 
counters, the waiter leading the 
way. He opened a door and hissed something rapid in Spanish 
to Herrera. 



"Oh, don't worry," Herrera 
told him. "We will not be long." 

"In back" turned out to be — a 
library. 

I was conscious of Herrera's 
eyes on me, and I don't think I 
showed any of what I felt. I even 
stayed with him for an hour or 
so, while he devoured a wormy 
copy of something called Moby 
Dick and I glanced through half 
a dozen ancient magazines. Some 
of those remembered classics 
went a long way toward easing 
my conscience — there was actually an early "Do You Make 
These Common Mistakes in 
English?" and a "Not a Cough 
in a Carload" that would have 
looked fine on the wall of my office, back in Schocken Tower. 
But I could not relax in the presence of so many books without a 
word of advertising in any of 
them. I am not a prude about 
solitary pleasures when they 
serve a useful purpose, but my 
tolerance has limits. 

Herrera knew, I think, that I 
lied when I told him I had a 
headache. 

Much later, he came stumbling 
into the Dorm and I turned my 
head away. We scarcely spoke 
after that. 

A week later, after a near-riot 
sparked by a rumor that the 
yeast fritters were adulterated 
with sawdust, I was summoned 
to the front office. 




 



A veep for Personnel saw me 
after I had waited an hour. 
"Groby?" 

"Yes, Mr. Milo." 

"Remarkable record you've 
made. Quite remarkable. I see 
your efficiency rating is straight 
fours." 

That was Bowen's work. He 
kept records. He had taken five 
years to worm himself into that 
very spot. "Thank you, Mr. 
Milo." 

"Welcome, I'm sure. We, uh, 
happen to have a vacancy approaching. One of our people up 
North. I see his work is falling 
off badly." 

Not his work — the ghost of 
his work, the shadow on paper 
carefully outlined and filled in 
by Bowen. I began to appreciate 
the disproportionate power that 
Connies could wield. 

"Do you happen to have any 
interest in purchasing, Groby?" 

"Strange that, you sensed it, 
Mr. Milo," I said evenly. "I've 
always had a feel for purchasing. 
.Read everything I could find on 
the subject." 

He began firing questions and I 
respectfully regurgitated answers 
from the Chlorella manual. He 
had memorized it twenty- odd 
years ago and I had memorized 
it only a week ago, so he was no 
match for me. After an hour he 
was convinced that George 
Groby was the very man needed 



for Chlorella Protein. 1 
That night I told the cell about 

.it. 

"It means New York," Bowen 
said positively. I couldn't keep 
back a great sigh. Kathy! 

He went on unaware: "I've 
got to issue you some — equipment. Look into my mouth." 

I peered in. Good fillings, a 
passable bridge and nothing else 
as far as I could see. I told him 
so. 

Bowen grinned. "By popping 
my lower jaw out and biting 
down hard, I can kill myself in 
a fifth of a second. One of those 
fillings is a shell that contains 
pure nicotine. You're going to get 
one like it." 

"The hell I am!" I started to 
say, and then shut up. The game 
was risky enough. 

"Our records," he said, taking 
a kit from a desk drawer, "contain,, only a single case of the filling being accidentally perforated. It never could happen again 
in a million years. You have 
nothing to worry about. Open 
your mouth, please." 

I opened. 

"Bite, please." 

I bit. 

"There!" 

"Done?" I muttered, curiously 
reluctant to close my mouth. 

"All done," he said. "Let me. 
see you bite. Harder . . . harder 
. . . harder. That's it!" He touched

a molar with a tweezer. "That's 
the one. You just bite down on 
it if captured. And for God's sake, 
have one of us remove it temporarily before you go to the dentist." 

"I'll do that," I said faintly. 

"Now," he said, "the recognition signals." 

There was a hand sign for 
short range, a grand hailing sign 
of distress for medium range. For 
long range there was a newspaper-ad code; quite a good one. 
He made me practice the sig^ns 
and memorize the code until the 
small hours of the morning. 
When we left through Chicken 
Little, I realized that I hadn't 
seen Herrera all day. I asked as 
we emerged what had happened. 

"He broke," Bowen said blunt
ly
I didn't say anything. A kind 
of shorthand talk among Connies, it meant : "Herrera toiled for 
years and years in the cause of 
the W. C. A. He gave up his 
nickels and dimes and the few 
pleasures they could buy him. 
He didn't marry and he didn't 
sleep with women because it 
would have imperiled security. 
He became possessed by doubts 
so secret that he didn't admit 
them to himself or us. The doubts 
and fears mounted. He was torn 
too many ways and he died." 

"Don't brood about it," Bowen 
said. "You're going North. 



You've got a job to do.™ 
I did. A big job. 

X 

T WENT to New York City aU 
most respectably, in a cheap 
front-office suit, aboard a tourist 
rocket, steerage class. Above me 
the respectable Costa Rican consumers oohed and ahed at the 
view from the prism windows or 
anxiously counted their few bills, 
wondering how far they'd go in 
the pleasures for sale by the colossus of the North. 

Below decks we were a shabbier, tougher gang, yet it was no 
labor freighter. We had no windows, but we had lights and 
vending machines and buckets. 

A plant protection man had 
made a little speech to us before 
we loaded: "You crumbs are going North, out of Costa Rican 
jurisdiction. You're going to better jobs. But don't forget that 
they are jobs. You're in hock to 
Chlorella. and Chlorella's claim 
on you is a prior lien. If any dtf 
you think you can disappear or 
break your contract, you're going to find out just how fast 
extradition for a commericat offense can be. Is everything clear?" 
Everything was clear. "All right, 
crumbs. Get aboard and give my 
regards to upper Broadway." 

Wc slid into a landing at Montauk without incident. Down be

low, we sat and waited while the 
consumers on tourist deck filed 
out. carrying "their baggage kits. 
Then we sat and waited while 
Food Customs inspectors, wearing the red-and-white A & P 
armbands, argued vociferously 
with our stewards over the surplus rations — one man had died 
on the trip, and the stewards, of 
course, held out his Chicken Little cutlets to sell in the open 
market. 

Finally the order came to fall 
out in fifties. We lined up and 
had our wrists stamped with our 
entry permits, marched by 
squads to the subway, and entrained for the city. I had a bit 
of luck — my group drew a 
freight compartment. 

At the Labor Exchange we 
were sorted out and tagged for 
our respective assignments. There 
was a bit of a scare when it 
came out that Chlorella had sold 
the contracts on twenty of us to 
I. G. Farben — nobody wants to 
work in the uranium mines — but 
I wasn't worried. 

The man next to me stared 
moodily as the guards cut out 
the unlucky twenty and herded 
them off. "It's a crime. Don't you 
think so. Mac? It violates the 
essential dignity of labor, what 
I call." 

I gave htm an angry glare. The 
man was a Connie, pure and 
simple. Then I remembered that 



I was a Connie, too. for the time 
being. I considered the use of the 
handclasp and decided against 
it. He would be worth remembering if I needed help; but if I revealed myself prematurely, he 
might call on me. 

We moved on to the Chlorella 
depot in Nyack suburbs. 

WASTE not, want not. Under 
New York, as under every 
city in the world, the sewage 
drains led to a scries of settling 
basins and traps. Every citizen 
knows how the organic waste of 
twenty-three million persons 
came waterborne through the venous tracery of the city's drains; 
how the salts were neutralized 
through ion-exchange, the chemically rich liquid piped to the 
kelp farms in Long Island Sound, 
the sludge that remained pumped 
into tank barges for shipment to 
Chlorella. I knew about it, but 
I had never seen or smelled it. 

My title was Procurement Expeditor, Class Nine. My job was 
coupling the flexible hoses that 
handled the sludge. After the first 
day, I shot a week's pay of sootextractor plugs for my nostrils; 
they didn't filter out all the odor, 
but they made it possible to live 
in it. 

On the third day I came off 
the shift and hit the showers. I 
had figured it out in advance: 
After six hours at the tanks 



 



137 



where there were no vending machines for the simple reason that 
no one could conceivably eat, 
drink or smoke anything in that 
atmosphere, the pent-up cravings of the crew kept them on the 
Popsie-Crunchie- Starrs cycle for 
half an hour before the first man 
even thought of a shower. 

By sternly repressing the 
craving, weaker in me than in 
most because it had had less 
time to become established, I 
managed to have the showers almost alone. When the mob arrived, / hit the vending machines. 
It was a simple application of intelligence, and if that doesn't 
bear out the essential difference 
between consumer and star class 
mentality, what does? Of course, 
as I say, the habits weren't as 
strong in me. 

There was one other man in 
the shower, but, with only two 
of us, we hardly touched. He 
handed me the soap as I came 
in; I lathered and let the water 
roar down over me under the 
full pressure of the recirculators. 
I was hardly aware he was there. 

As I passed the soap back to 
him, though, I felt his third finger 
touch my wrist, the index finger 
circle around the base of my 
thumb. 

"Oh," I said stupidly, and returned the handclasp. '"Are you 
my contact — " 

"Ssh!" He gestured at the Mu


zak spy-mike dangling from the 
ceiling. He turned his back on 
me and meticulously soaped himself again. 

When he returned the soap, a 
scrap of paper clung to it. In the 
locker room I squeezed it dry, 
spread it out. It read: "Tonight 
is pass night. Go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Classics 
Room. Be in front of the Maidenform Exhibit at exactly five minutes before closing time." 

I joined the queue at the supervisor's desk as soon as I was 
dressed. In less than half an hour, 
I had a stamped pass authorizing me to skip bedcheck for the 
night. I caught the shuttle down 
to Bronxville, transferred to a 
north-bound local, rode one station, switched to the south-bound 
side and got out at Schocken 
Tower. No one appeared to be 
following me. I hadn't expected 
anyone to, but it never pays to 
take chances. 

My Connie rendezvous at the 
Met was almost four hours off. I 
stood around in the lobby until 
a cop, contemptously eying my 
cheap clothing, moved toward 
me. I had hoped Hester or perhaps even Fowler Schocken himself might come through. No 
such luck. I saw a good many 
faces I recognized, of course, but 
none I was sure I could trust. 
And, until I found out what lay 
behind the double cross on Starr
zelius Glacier. I had no intention 
of telling just anybody that I was 
still alive. 

The Pinkerton said, "You want 
to give the Schocken people your 
business, crumb? You got a big 
account for them, maybe?" 

"Sorry," I said, and headed for 
the street door. It didn't figure 
that he would bother to follow me 
through the crowd in the lobby; 
he didn't. 

I dodged around the recreation 
room, where a group of consumers were watching a PregNot love 
story on the screen and getting 
their samples of Cofhest. and 
ducked into the service elevators. 

"Eightieth," I said to the operator, and at once realized I 
had blundered. 

The operator's voice said 
sharply through the speaker 
grille: "Service elevators go only 
to the seventieth floor, you in 
Car Five. What do you want?" 

"Messenger," I lied miserably. 
"I got to make a pickup from Mr. 
Schocken's office. I told them I 
wouldn't be let into Mr. Schocken's office, a fellow like me. I 
told them, 'Look, he's probably 
got twenny-Rve seckatarieS I got 
to go through before they let me 
see him.' I said — " 

"The mail room is on fortyfive," the operator said, a shade 
less sharply. "Stand in front of 
the door so I can see you." 

I moved into range of the TV 



ike. I had never been in the 
elevator operators' room, a thousand feet below me, where they 
pushed the buttons that triggered 
the relays that sent the cars up 
and down the toothed shafts; but 
I would have given a year's pay 
to have been able to look into it 
then. 

I stood there for half a minute. 
Then the operator's voice said 
noncommittally. "All right, you. 
Back in the car. Forty-fifth floor, 
first slide to the left." 

The others in the car stared at 
me through an incurious haze of 
Coffiest's alkaloids until I got 
out. I stepped on the leftbound 
slidewalk and went past the door 
marked "Mail Room" to the corridor juncture where my slidewalk dipped down around its 
roller. It took me a little while 
to find the stairway, but that was 
all right. I needed the time to 
catch up on my swearing. I 
didn't dare use the elevators 
again. 

Have you ever climbed thirtyfive flights of stairs? 

T SKULKED along the corridors in executive country, very 
conscious of the fact that the first 
person who paid any attention to 
me would either recognize me or 
throw me out. Only clerks were 
in the corridors, and none I'd 
known at all well; my luck was 
running strong. 

But not strong enough. Fowler 
Schocken's office was locked. 

I ducked into the office of his 
secretary 3, which was deserted, 
and thought things over. Fowler 
usually played a few holes of 
golf at the country club after 
Work. It was pretty late for him 
still to be there, but I thought I 
might as well take the chance — though it was four more nights 
to the club. 

I made it standing up. The 
country club was a handsome 
layout, which was only fair because the dues were handsome, 



too. Besides the golf links, the 
tennis court and other sports facilities, the whole north end of 
the room was woods — more 
than a dozen beautifully simulated trees — and at least twenty 
recreation booths for reading, 
watching movies or any other 
spectator pleasure. 


A mixed foursome was playing 
golf. I moved close to their seats 
as unobtrusively as possible. 
They were intent on their dials 
and buttons, guiding their players along the twelfth hole fairway. I read their scores from the 
telltale with a sinking heart: all 
were in the high nineties. Duffers. 
Fowler Schocken averaged under 
eighty for the course and couldn't 
be in a group like that. As I 
came close, I saw that both the 
men were strangers to me. 

I ' hesitated before retreating, 
trying to decide what to do next. 




CIA VY PlANfT 



Schocken wasn't in sight anywhere in the club. Conceivably 
he was in one of the recreation 
booths, but I could scarcely dare 
open the doors of all of them to 
see. 

One of the girts had just sunk 
a four-inch putt to finish the 
hole. Smiling happily as the 
others complimented her, she 
leaned forward to pull the lever 
that brought the puppet players 
back to the tee and changed the 
layout to the dogleg of the thirteenth hole, and I caught a 
glimpse of her face. It was Hester, 
my secretary. 

I couldn't guess how Hester 
came to be in the country club, 
but I knew everything else there 
was to know about Hester. I retreated to an alcove near the entrance to the ladies' room. It was 
only about ten minutes wait before Hester showed up. 

She fainted, of course. 

SWEARING. I carried her into 
the alcove. There was a 
couch; I put her on it. There was 
a door; I closed it. 

She blinked up at me as consciousness came back. "Mitch," 
she choked. "You can't be. 
You're dead." 

"I am not dead," I told her. 
"Somebody else died and they 
switched bodies. I don't know 
who 'they' are. Yes, it's realty 
me. Mitch Courtenay, your boss. 

141 



I can prove it. For instance, remember last year's Christmas 
party, when you were so worried 
about — " 

"Never mind," she said hastily. 
"My God, Mitch — I mean Mr. 
Courtenay — " 

"Mitch is, good enough, I'm 

alive, all right, but I'm in a kind 
of peculiar mess. I've got to get 
in touch with Fowler Schocken. 
Can you fix it right away?" 

She swallowed and reached for 
a cigarette. Recovering, I automatically took out a Starr. 

"Mr. Schocken's on the Moon. 
It's a big secret, but I guess I can 
tell you. It's something to do with 
the Venus project. After you got 
killed — well, you know what I 
mean — after that, when he put 
Mr. Runstead on the project and 
it began to slip, he decided to 
take matters into his own hands. 
I gave him all your notes. One 
of them said something about the 
Moon, I guess. Anyway, he took 
off a couple of days ago." 

"Who'd he leave in charge 
here? Harvey Bruner? Can you 
reach — " 

Hester was shaking her head. 
"Mr. Schocken switched in such 
a hurry, there wasn't anyone to 
spare to take over his job except 
Mr. Runstead. But I can call 
him right away." 

"No!" I looked at my watch 
and groaned. I would have just 
about time to make it to the Met. 



"I've got to leave. Don't say anything to anybody, will you? 1*11 
figure something out and call 
you. Let's see, when I call I'll 
say I'm — what's the name of 
that doctor of your mother's? — 
Dr. Gallant. And I'll arrange to 
meet you and tell you what we're 
going to do. I can count on you, 
Hester, can't I?" 

"Sure, Mitch," she said breathlessly. 

"Fine. Now you'll have to convoy me down in the elevator. I 
haven't got time to walk and 
there'll be trouble if a guy like 
me gets caught on the club floor." 
I stopped and looked her over. 
"Speaking of which, what in the 
world are you doing here?" 

Hester blushed. "After you 
were gone, there weren't any 
other secretarial jobs. The rest 
of the executives had their girls 
and I just couldn't be a consumer 
again, Mitch, not with the bills 
and all. And — well, there was 
this opening up here, you see." 

I hope nothing showed on my 
face; God knows I tried. Damn 
you to hell, Runstead, I said to 
myself, thinking of Hester's mother and Hester's young man 
that she'd maybe been going to 
marry some day, and a man like 
Runstead wrecking executives' 
lives like mine and staff lives 
like Hester's and dragging them 
down to the level of consumers. 

"Don't worry, Hester," I said 



142 




 



gently. "I'll make everything up 
to you." 

I knew how to do it, too. 
Quite a lot of the girls on the ZZ 
contract managed to avoid the 
automatic renewal and downgrading. It would cost a lot for 
me to buy out her Contract before 
the year -was up, so that was out 
of the question: but some of the 
girls did pretty well with single 
executives after their first year. 
And I was important enough so 
that if I made a suggestion to 
some branch head or bureau 
chief, he would not be likely to 
ignore it, or even to treat her 
badly. 

I don't approve of sentiment in 
business matters, but this was a 
special situation. 

TFESTER insisted on loaning 
me some money, so I made 
it to the Met with time to spare 
by taking a pedicab. Even 
though I had paid the driver in 
advance, he could not refrain 
from making a nasty comment 
about high -living consumers as 
I got out. 

I have always had a fondness 
for the Met. I don't go for religion — partly, I suppose, because 
it's a Taunton account — but 
there is a grave, ennobling air 
about the grand old masterpieces 
in the Met that gives me a feeling of peace and reverence. I 
spent my few spare minutes 



standing silently before the bust 
of G. Washington Hill, and I felt 
more self-assured than I had 
since that first afternoon at the 
South Pole. 

At precisely five minutes before midnight, I was standing 
before the big, late-period Maidenform — number 35 in the catalogue: "I Dreamed I went 
Ice-Fishing in My Maidenform 
Bra"— when I became conscious 
of someone whistling in the corridor behind me. The notes were 
irrelevant: the cadence formed 
one of the recognition signals I'd 
learned in the cell room under 
Chicken Little. 

One of the guards was strolling away. She looked over her 
shoulder at me and smiled. 

To all external appearances, it 
was a casual pickup. We linked 
arms, and I felt the coded pressure of her fingers on my wrist: 

D-O-IT-T T-A-L-K. W-H-E-N I 
L-E-A-V-E Y-O-U C-0 T-O T-H-E 
B-A-C-K 0-F T-H-E R-O-O-M 
S-I-T D-O-W-N A-N-D W-A-I-T 

I nodded. She took me to a 
plastic-finished door, pushed it 
open, pointed inside. I went in 
alone. 

There were ten or fifteen consumers sitting in straight-back 
chairs, facing an elderly consumer with a lectorial goatee. I 
found a seat in the back of the 
room and sat in it. No one paid 
any particular attention to me. 



 



The lecturer was covering the 
high spots of some particularly 
boring pre- commercial period. I 
listened with half my mind, trying to catch some point of similarity in the varying types 
around me. All were Connies, I 
was reasonably sure — else why 
would I be here? But the basic 
stigmata, the surface mark of 
the lurking fanatic inside that 
should have been apparent, escaped rne. They were all consumers, with the pinched look 
that soyaburgers and Yeasties inevitably give; but I could have 
passed any of them in the street 
without a second glance. Yet 
this was New York, and Bowen 
had spoken of it as though the 
Connies I'd meet here were pretty high up in the scale. 

That was a consideration, too. 
When I got out of this mess — 
when I got through to Fowler 
Schocken and cleared my status 
— I might be in a position to 
break up this whole filthy conspiracy. I looked over the persons in the room a little more 
attentively, memorizing their features. I didn't want to fail to recognize them, next time we came 
in contact. 

There must have been some 
sort of signal, but I missed it. 
The lecturer stopped almost in 
mid- sentence, and a plump little 
man in a goatee from the first 
row stood up. 



"All right," he said in an ordinary tone, "we're all present and 
there's no sense wasting any more 
time. We're against waste; that's 
why we're here. For the purpose 
of this meeting, we'll use numbers. You can call me 'One,' you 
'Two' — " he pointed to the man 
in the next seat — "and so on by 
rows to the back of the room. 
All clear? 

"Now listen closely. This is 
world operational headquarters, 
right here in New York; you can't 
go any higher. Each of you was 
picked for some special quality — 
you know what they are. You'll 
all get assignments tonight. But 
before you do, I want to point 
out one thing. You don't know 
me and I don't know you; every 
one of you got a big buildup from 
your last cells, but sometimes 
the men in the field get a little too 
enthusiastic. If they were wrong 
about you . . . Well, you understand these things, eh?" 

There was a general nod. I 
nodded, too, but I paid particular attention to memorizing that 
little goatee. One by one, numbers 
were called, and the newjohns 
got up, conferred briefly with the 
goatee, and left, in couples and 
threes, for unannounced destinations. I was almost the last to be 
called. Only a very young girl 
with orange hair and a cast in 
her eye was still in the room. 

"Okay, you two," said the man 



144 




 



with the goatee. "You are going 
to be a team, so you might as 
well know names. Groby, meet 
Corwin. Groby's a kind of copysmith. Celia's an artist." 

"Right," she said, lighting a 
Starr. A perfert consumer type, 
if only she hadn't been corrupted 
by these zealots: I noticed her 
jaws working on Hi-Kick Gum 
even while she smoked. 

"We'll get along fine," I said 
approvingly. 

"You sure will," said the man 
in the goatee. "You have to. In 
order to give you a chance to 
show what you can do, we'll have 
to let you know a lot of stuff that 
we don't want to read in the 
morning paper. If you don't 
work out for us, you see the fix 
we'll be in." He tapped a little 
bottle of colorless fluid on the 
desk top. The tinny rattle of the 
aluminum top was no tinnier 
than my voice as I said, "Yes, 
sir," because I knew what little 
bottles of colorless fluid could be 
assumed to contain. 

It turned out, though, that it 
wasn't much of a problem. I 
spent three difficult hours in that 
little room, then pointed out that 
if I didn't get back to barracks 
I. would miss the morning work 
call and there would be hell to 
pay. So they excused me. 

But I missed work call anyhow, t came out of the Museum 
into a perfect spring dawn, feel


ing, all in all, pretty content with 
life. A figure loomed out of the 
smog and peered into my face. I 
recognized the sneering face of 
the solo taxi-pusher who had 
brought me to the Museum. He 
said briskly, "Hel-lo, Mr. Courtenay," and then the obelisk from 
behind the Museum, or something 
very much like it. smacked me 
across the back of the neck.

"TS he ready for Hedy?" I heard 
somebody say. 

"Good God. no!" 

"I was only asking." 

"You ought to know better. 
First you give the amphetamine, 
plasma, maybe a niacin megaunit. Then they're ready for 
Hedy. She doesn't like it if they 
keep blacking out. She sulks." 

Nervous laugh with a chill in 

it. 

I opened my eyes and felt secure and grateful. For what I 
could see was a cerebral-gray 
ceiling, the shade you find only 
in the brain room of an advertising agency. I was safe in the arms 
of Fowler Schocken Associates — • 
or was I? I didn't recognize the 
face that leaned over me. 

"Why so pleased?" the face inquired nastily. "Don't you know 
where you are?" 

After that it was easy to guess. 
"Taunton's?" I croaked. 



 



MS 



"That is correct." 

I tried my arms and legs and 
found they didn't respond. I 
couldn't tell whether it was drugs 
or a plasticocoon. "Look," I said 
steadily, "I don't know what you 
people think you're doing, but I 
advise you to stop it. Apparently 
this is a kidnaping for business 
purposes. You people are either 
going to let me go or kill me. If 
you kill me without a declaration, 
you'll get the cerebrin, so of 
course you're going to let me go 
eventually. I suggest you do it 
now." 

"Kill you. Courtenay?" asked 
the face with mocking wonder. 
"How would we do that? You're 
dead already. Everybody knows 
that. You died on Starrzelius 
Glacier; don't you remember?" 

I struggled again, without results. "They'll brainburn you," I 
said. "Are you people crazy? 
Who wants to be brainburned?" 

The face said nonchalantly: 
"You'd be surprised." And in an 
aside to somebody else : "Tell 
Hedy he'll be ready soon." Hands 
did something, there was a click, 
and I was helped to sit up. The 
skin-tight pulling at my joints 
showed it was a plasticocoon, 
which meant I might as well save 
my strength. 

A buzzer buzzed and I was told 
sharply : "Keep a respectful 
tongue in your head, Courtenay. 
Mr. Taunton's coming in." 



B. J. Taunton lurched in. He 
looked just the way I had always 
seen him from afar at the speaker's tables in hundreds of banquets : florid, gross, overdressed 
and drunk. 

He surveyed me, feet planted 
wide apart, swaying just a little. 
"Courtenay," he said. "Too bad. 
You might have turned out to be 
something if you hadn't cast your 
lot with that swindler Schocken. 
Too bad." 

He was drunk, he was a disgrace to the profession, but I 
couldn't keep my respect for an 
entrepreneur out of my voice. 
"Sir," I said, "there must be 
some misunderstanding. There's 
been no provocation of Taunton 
Associates to commit commercial 
murder — has there?" 

"Not what the law considers 
provocation. All Schocken did 
was steal my groundwork, take 
over my senators, suborn my 
committee witnesses and steal 
Venus from me!" His voice rose. 

"No, no provocation. He's carefully refrained from killing any 
of my people. Shrewd Schocken; 
ethical Schocken !" 

His glassy eyes glared at me. 
"Of all the low-down, lousy, unethical, cheap- jack stunts ever 
pulled on me, yours was the rottenest." He thumped his chest, 
briefly threatening his balance. 
"/ figured out a way to. commit a 
safe commercial murder and

you played possum like a scared 
rat. You ran like a rabbit, you 
dog." 

"Sir," I said desperately. "I 
don't know what you're driving 
at." His years of boozing. I 
thought, had finally caught up 
with him. No sober ad man could 
have mixed his similes so unconsciously. 

He sat down; one of his men 
darted in and there was a chair 
seat to meet his broad rump in 
the nick of time. With an expansive gesture, B. J. Taunton 
said to me: "Courtenay, I am essentially an artist." 

The words popped out of me 
automatically: "Of course, Mr. 
— " I almost said "Schocken." 
It was a well -conditioned reflex. 
"Of course, Mr. Taunton." 

"A dreamer of dreams; a weaver of visions." I seemed to see 
Fowler Schocken sitting there instead of his rival, the man who 
stood against everything that 
Fowler* Schocken stood for. "I 
wanted Venus, Courtenay, and I 
shall have it. No rocket under 
Schocken's management is ever 
going to get off the ground, if I 
have to corrupt every one of his 
underlings and kill every one of 
his section heads. For I am essentially an artist." 

"Mr. Taunton," I said steadily, 
"you can't kill section heads as 
casually as all that. You can't 
find anybody who'll take the risk 



for you. Nobody wants to be 
brainburned." 

"I got a mechanic to drop that 
'copter pod on you, didn't I? I 
got an unemployable bum to 
plug you through your apartment 
window, didn't I? Unfortunately, 
both missed. And then you 
crossed us up with that cowardly 
run-out on the glacier." 

I didn't say anything. The 
run-out on the glacier had been 
no idea of mine. God only knew 
whose idea it had been to have 
Runstead club me, shanghai me 
and leave a substitute corpse in 
my place. 

"Tools in my hands," Taunton 
brooded. "The greatness of an 
artist is in his simplicity, his lack 
of confusion, Courtenay. You say 
to me: 'Nobody wants to be 
brainburned.' / say: 'Find somebody who wants to be brainburned and use him.' " 

"Wants to be brainburned?" I 
repeated stupidly. 

"Explai%" said Taunton to 
someone alongside him. "I want 
him thoroughly convinced." 

One of his men told me dryly: 
"It's a matter of psychological 
need, Courtenay. Ever hear of 
masochists?" 

"Sure," I said as nastily as I 
could. "Consumers who prefer 
Taunton products." 

"Worse than that . . . people 
with a deep need for physical and 
menta! punishment. In some 



 



147 



cases, people with so great a 
feeling of guilt — and it doesn't 
matter to us whether the feeling 
is realistic or not — that only an 
agonizing death can wipe it out. 
Do you understand now?" 

I did, and it frightened me. 
"Flagellants," I whispered. "Selfimmolation. But I thought that 
with our psychiatric methods — " 

"Most of them are detected, 
treated or isolated, Courtenay. 
But not all. Our matchless research facilities here at Taunton 
have unearthed several. They are 
eager would-be suicides, only the 
suicides they would inflict on 
themselves aren't sufficiently painful. They want the exquisite agony of cerebrin. You offer that to 
them. Simple, isn't it?" 

Yes, simple . . . and as sinister 
as anything one could expect 
from Taunton. I knew from my 
research that there were consumers who defied all the principles of sales psychology. There 
was Malone, who qujetly dug 
tunnels for six years and one 
Sunday morning blew up all of 
Red Bank, New Jersey, because 
a Burns traffic cop had gotten 
him sore. Conversely, we had 
James Revere, hero of the White 
Cloud disaster, a shy, frail tourist-class steward who had returned again and again to the 
flames until he rescued 76 passengers, and died because his 
flesh had been burned from his 



bones. And there were others who 
seemingly sought destruction, 
against every instinct we built 
our great profession on — selfpreservation, self-advancement, 
gratification of the pleasure principle. It had never made sense, 
so we had dismissed these cases 
as exceptions that proved our 
rules. 

Taunton was an artist. He 
hadn't dismissed these cases; he'd 
worked out a use for them. It 
meant I was as good as dead. I'd 
never get back to the Venus project. I'd never see Kathy again. 

rpAUNTON'S blurry voice broke 
in: "You grasp the pattern? 
The big picture? The essential 
theme of it is that I'm going to 
repossess Venus. Now, beginning 
at the beginning, tell us about the 
Schocken Agency. All its little 
secrets, its little weaknesses, its 
ins and outs, its corruptible employees, its appropriations, its 
Washington contacts — " 

I was a dead man with nothing 
to lose. "No," I said. 

One of Taunton's men said 
abruptly, "He's ready for Hedy," 
got up and went out. 

"You've studied pre -history, 
Courtenay," Taunton pointed 
out. "You may recognize the 
name of Giles de Rais." I did, 
and felt a tightness over my 
scalp, like a steel helmet slowly 
shrinking. "All the generations of 



148 




 



pre-history produced only one 
Giles de Rais. Nowadays we have 
our pick of several. Out of all the 
people I might have chosen to 
faandle special work like that for 
me, I took Hedy. You'll see why." 

The door opened and a pale, 
adenoidal girl with lank blonde 
hair was standing in it. She had 
a silly grin on her face; her lips 
were thin and bloodless. In one 
hand she held a six-inch needle 
Bel in a plastic handle. 

I looked into her eyes and began screaming. I couldn't stop 
until they led her away and 
closed the door again. 

I was broken. 

Taunton leaned back comfortably and said: "Give," 

I tried, but I couldn't. My 
voice wouldn't work right and I 
couldn't remember whether my 
firm was Fowler Schocken or 
(Bchocken Fowler. 

Taunton got up at last. "We'll 
put you on ice for a while, 
Courtenay, so you can pull yourself together. I need a drink 
mys<lf." He shuddered involuntarily and then beamed again. 
"Sleep on it," he said, and left 
with a slight stagger. 

Two of his men carted me from 
the brain room, down a corridor 
and into a bare cubbyhole with a 
vi ry solid door. It seemed to be 
night in executives' country. 
Nothing was going on in any of 
the offices we passed, lights were 



low and a corridor guard was 
yawning at his desk. 

I asked unsteadily: "Will you 
take the cocoon off me? I'm going 
to be a mess if I don't get out of 
it." 

"No orders," one of them said, 
and they slammed the solid door 
and locked it. 

I flopped around the small 
floor, trying to find something 
sharp enough to break the film 
and give me an even chance of 
bursting the plastic, but there was 
nothing. After incredible contortions and a dozen jarring falls, I 
found that I could never get to 
my feet. The doorknob had offered a very faint ghost of hope, 
but it might as well have been a 
million miles away. 

Mitchell Courtenay, star class 
copysmith. Mitchell Courtenay, 
key man of the Venus Section. 
Mitchell Courtenay, destroyer-tobe of the Connies. Mitchell 
Courtenay flopping on the floor 
of a cell in the offices of the sleaziest, crookedest agency that ever 
blemished the profession, without 
any prospect except betrayal and 
— with luck — a merciful death. 
Kathy at least would never know. 
She would think I had died like 
a fool on the glacier, meddling 
with the power pack when I had 
no business to . . . 

The lock on the door rattled. 
They were coming for me. But 
when the door opened, I saw 



 



U9 



from the floor a single pair of 
matchstick ankles, nylon-clad. 

*'I love you," said the strange, 
dead voice of a woman. "They 
said I would have to wait, but I 
couldn't." It was Hedy. She had 
her needle. 

I tried to cry for help, but my 
throat was paralyzed as she knelt 
beside me with shining eyes. The 
temperature of the room seemed 
to drop ten degrees. She clamped 
her bloodless lips on mine; they 
were like heated iron. And then 
the left side of my face and head 
were being torn off. It lasted for 
seconds and blended into a red 
haze and unconsciousness. 

"Wake up," the dead voice was 
saying. "I want you. Wake up." 
Lightning smashed at my right 
elbow and I cried out and jerked 
my arm. My arm moved — 

It moved! 

The bloodless lips descended 
on mine again, and again her 
needle ran into my jaw, probing 
exactly for the great lump of the 
trigeminal facial nerve, and finding it. I fought the red haze that 
was trying to swallow me up. My 
arm had moved — she had perforated the membrane of the 
cocoon and it could be burst. The 
needle searched again and somehow the pain was channeled to 
my right arm. In one convulsive 
jerk it was free. 

I think I took the back of her 
neck in my hand and squeezed. I 



am not sure. I do not want to be 
sure. But after five minutes she 
and her love for me did not matter. I ripped the plastic from me 
and got to my feet an inch at a 
time, moaning with stiffness. 

The corridor guard could not 
matter any more. If he had not 
come at my cries, he would never. 
I walked from the room and saw 
the guard apparently sleeping 
face -down on his desk. As I 
stood over him, I noticed a very 
little blood coagulating in the 
small valley between the two 
cords of his shrunken old neck.One thrust from Hedy transfixing 
the medulla had been enough. I 
Could testify that her knowledge 
of the nervous system's topography was complete. 

The guard wore a gun that I 
hesitated over for a moment and 
then rejected. In his pockets were 
a few dollars that would be more 
useful. I hurried on to the ladders. His desk clock said 0605. 

1KNEW already about climbing upstairs. I learned then 
about climbing downstairs. If 
your heart's in good shape, there's 
little to choose between them. It 
took me an estimated thirty minutes in my condition to get from 
executives* country onto the populated stairs below. 

The first sullen stirrings of the 
work-bound consumers were well 
under way. I passed half a dozen 



'ii N 




 



bitter fist-fights and one knife 
battle. The Taunton Building 
nightdwellers were a low, dirty 
lot who never would have been 
allowed stairspace in the Schocken Tower, but it was all to the 
good. I attracted no attention 
whatsoever in my filthy clothes 
and sporting a fresh stab wound 
in my face. Some of the bachelor 
girls whistled — pure reflex, of 
course- — but that was all. 

My timing was good. I left the 
building lobby in the very core 
of a cheek-by-jowl mob boiling 
out the door to the shuttle which 
would take them to their wretched 
jobs. I thought I saw men in 
plainclothes searching the mob 
from second-floor windows, but 
I didn't look up before I got into 
the shuttle station. 

At the change booth, I broke 
all my bills and went into the 
washroom. "Split a shower, bud?" 
a shabby woman asked me. I 
wanted one badly and by myself, 
but I didn't dare betray any 
white-collar traits. She and I 
pooled our coins for a five-minute 
salt, thirty-second fresh, with 
soap. I found that I was scrubbing my right hand over and over 
again. I found that when the cold 
Water hit the left side of my face, 
the pain was dizzying. 

After the shower, I wedged myself into the shuttle and spent 
two hours zigzagging under the 
city. My 1 a st stop was Ti mes 



Square, which now was mostly 
a freight area. While cursing consumers hurled crates of protein 
ticketed for various parts of town 
onto the belts, I tried to phone 
Kathy. There was nobody home. 

I got Hester at the Schocken 
Tower and told her: "I want you 
to raise every cent you can, borrow, clean out your savings, and 
buy a Starr2elius apparel outfit 
for me. Meet me with it soonest 
at the place where your mother 
broke her leg two years ago. The 
exact place, remember?" 

"Yes, naturally. But my contract — " 

"Don't make me beg you, Hester. Trust me. For God's sake, 
hurry. And if you get here and 
I'm in the hands of the guards, 
don't recognize me." 

I hung up and slumped in the 
phone booth until the next party 
hammered indignantly on the 
door. I walked slowly around the 
station, had Coffiest and a cheese 
sandwich and rented a morning 
paper at the newsstand. The story 
about me was a bored little item 
on page three: SOUGHT FOR 
CB & FEMICIDE. It said 
George Groby had failed to return from pass to his job with 
Chlorella and had used his free 
time to burglarize executives' 
country in the Taunton Building. He had killed a secretary 
who stumbled on him and made 
his escape. 



 



Ml 



Hester met me half an hour 
later near the loading chute from 
which a crate had once whizzed 
and broken her mother's leg. She 
looked terrified; technically, she 
was as guilty of contract breach 
as "George Groby." 

I took the garment box from 
her and asked : "Do you have 
fifteen hundred dollars left?" 

"Just about. My mother was 
frantic — " 1 

"Get us reservations on the 
next Moon ship; today if possible. Meet me back here. I'll be 
wearing the new clothes." 

"Us? The Moon?" she 
squeaked, 

"Yes, us. I've got to get off 
Earth before I'm killed. This time 
it'll be for keeps." 

XII 

IN ten hours, we were groaning 
side by side under the takeoff 
acceleration of the Moonship 
David Ricardo. She had coldbloodedly passed herself off as a 
Schocken employee on special detail to the Moon and me as 
Groby, Sales Analyst 6. Naturally the dragnet for Groby, Expediter 9, had not included the 
Astoria spaceport. Sewage workers on the lam from CB and Femicide wouldn't hop a rocket, of 
course. 

We rated a compartment and 
the max ration. The David Ri


cardo was so constructed that 
most passengers rated them. It 
wasn't a trip for the idly curious 
or the consumer fifteen -sixteenths 
of the population. The Moon was 
strictly business — mining — and a 
very little sight-seeing. Our fellow passengers, what we saw of 
them at the ramp, were preoccupied engineers, a few laborers in 
the small steerage, and silly-rich 
men and women who wanted to 
say they'd been there. 

After takeoff, Hester was hysterically gay for a while, and 
then snapped. She sobbed on my 
shoulder, frightened at the enormity of what she'd done. She'd 
been brought up in a deeply 
moral Sales-respecting home; you 
couldn't expect her to break a 
labor contract without an emotional lashback. 

"Mr. Courtenay — Mitch — if 
only I could be sure it was all 
right! I know you've always been 
good to me and I know you 
wouldn't do anything wrong, but 
I'm so scared and miserable!" 

"You be the judge, Hester. 
Taunton has found out that there 
are people who are willing to 
commit unprovoked commercial 
murder so they can be given cerebrin. He thinks Mr. Schocken 
grabbed the Venus project from 
him. He's tried twice at least to 
kill me. I thought for a while 
Mr. Runstead was one of his 
agents, assigned to wreck Schock

en's handling of the Venus account. Now, I don't know. Mr. 
Runstead clubbed me when I 
went after him at the South Pole, 
spirited me away to a labro 
freighter under a faked identity 
and left a substitute body for 
mine. 

"And." I added cautiously, 
"there are Connies involved in 
it." 

She uttered a small shriek. 

"I don't know how they dovetail," I said. "But I was in a 
Connie cell — " 

"Mister Courtenay!" 

"Strictly as a blind," I hastily 
explained. "I was stuck in Chlorella Costa Rica and the only way 
north seemed to be through the 
Connie network. They had a cell 
in the factory, I joined up, turned 
on the talent, and got transferred 
to New York. The rest you 
know." 

She paused for a long time and 
asked: "Are you sure it's all 
right?" 

Wishing desperately that it 
were, I firmly said: "Of course, 
Hester." 

She gave me a game smile. 
"I'll get our rations," she said, 
unsnapping herself. "You'd better stay here." 

FORTY hours out, I snarled 
at Hester: "The blasted blackmarketing steward is going too 
far! Look at this!" I held up my 



bulb of water and my ration box. 

The seal was clearly tampered 
with on both containers, and visibly there was water missing. 
"Max rations are supposed to be 
tamper- proof, but this is plain 
burglary. How do yours look?" 

"Same," she said listlessly. 
"You can't do anything about it. 
Let's not eat just yet, Mr. Courtenay." She made a marked effort 
to be vivacious. "Tennis, anyone?" 

"All right," I grumbled, and set 
up the field, borrowed from the 
ship recreation closet. 

She was better at tennis than 
I, but I took her in straight sets. 
Her coordination was way off. 
She'd stab for a right forecourt 
deep crosscourt return and like 
as not miss the button entirely— 
if she didn't send the ball into the 
net by failing to surge power with 
her left hand on the rheostat. A 
half hour of the exercise seemed 
to do both of us good. She cheered 
up and we ate our rations. 

There was little enough to do 
in our cramped quarters. Every 
eight hours she would go for our 
tagged rations, I would grumble 
about the shortage and tampering, we'd have .some tennis and 
then eat. The rest of the time 
passed somehow watching the 
ads come and go — all Schocken 
—on the walls. Well enough, I 
thought. Schocken's on the Moon 
and I won't be kept from him 



 



153 



there. Things weren't so crowded. 
Moon to Schocken to Kathy — a 
twinge of feeling. I could have 
asked casually what Hester had 
heard about Jack O'Shea, but I 
didn't. I was afraid I might not 
like what she had heard. 

A drab service announcement 
at last interrupted the parade of 
ads: cooks to the galley (the 
David Ricardo was a British 

Ship) FOR FINAL LIQUID FEEDING. 
THIS IS H-8 AND NO FURTHER 
SOLID OR LIQUID FOOD SHOULD BE 
CONSUMED UNTIL TOUCHDOWN. 

Hester smiled and went out 
with our tray. 

As usual, it was ten minutes 
before she returned. We were getting some pull from the Moon by 
then, enough to unsettle my stomach. I burped miserably while 
watting. 

SHE came back with two Coffiest bulbs and reproached me 
gaily: "Why, Mitch, you haven't 
set up the tennis court!" 

"Didn't feel like it." I put out 
my hand -for my bulb. She didn't 
give it to me. "Well?" 

"Just one set?" she coaxed. 
"You heard me," I snapped. 
"Let's not forget who's who 
around here." I wouldn't have 
said it if it hadn't been Cofnest, 
I suppose. The Stanzelius-red 
bulb kicked things off in me — 
nagging ghosts of withdrawal 
symptoms. 



She stiffened. "I'm sorry, Mr. 
Courtenay." And then she 
clutched at her middle and threw 
up, violently, her face distorted. 
Astounded, I snapped the air regenerator switch to "Blast" and 
grabbed her. She was moaning 
with pain. 

"Hester," I said, "what is it?" 

"Don't drink it," she croaked, 
her hand kneading her belly. 
"The Coffiest. Poison. Your rations. Fve been tasting them." 
Her nails tore first the nylon of 
her midriff and then her skin as 
she clawed at the pain. 

"Send a doctor!" I was yelling 
into the compartment mike. 
"Woman's dying here!" 

The chief steward's voice answered me : "Ship's doctor'll be 
there right away, sir." 

Hester's contorted face began 
to relax, frightening me terribly. 
She said softly: "Bitch Kathy. 
Running out on you. Mitch and 
bitch. Funny. You're too good fox 
her. She wouldn't have. My life. 
Yours." There was another spasm 
across her face. "Wife versus secretary. A laugh. It always was. 
You never even kissed me — " 

I didn't get a chance to. She 
was gone while the ship's doctor 
was still hauling himself briskly 
in along the handline. His face 
fell. We towed her to the lazarette 
and he put her in a cardiac-node 
exciter that started her heart 
going again. Her chest began to 




 



rise and fall and she opened her 

eye*. 

"Where are you?" asked the 
doctor, loudly and clearly. She 
moved her head slightly and a 
pulse of hope shot through me. 

"Response?" I whispered to the 
doctor. 

"Random," he said with professional coldness. He was right. 
There were more slight headmovements and a nervous flutter 
of the eyelids, which were working independently. "Who are 
you?" brought a wrinkle between 
her eyes and a tremor of the lip, 
but no more. 

Gently enough, the doctor 
began to explain to me : "I'm 
going to turn it off. Irreversible 
clinical death has occurred. It's 
often hard for a person with emotional ties to believe — " 

I watched her eyelids flutter, 
one with a two-four beat, the 
other with a three -four beat. 
"Turn it off," I said hoarsely. 
He cut Hi* current and withdrew 
the needle. 

"There was nausea?" he asked. 
I nodded. "Her first space flight?" 
I nodded. "Abdominal pain?" I 
nodded. "No previous distress?" I 
shook my head. "History of ver*tigo?" I shrugged; I didn't know. 
He was driving at something. He 
kept asking, and the answers he 
wanted were as obvious as a magician's forced card. Allergies, 
easy bleeding, headaches, painful 

GRAVY PLAN IT 



menses — at last he said decisively: "I believe it's Fleischman's 
Disease. It stems from some derangement of function in the 
adrenocorticotrophic bodies under 
free flight, we think. It kicks off 
a chain reaction of tissue-incompatibilities which affects the cerebrospinal fluid — " 

I reached for the bulb and then 
remembered. "Have one with 
me," I said. 

He nodded and, with no stalling, drank from one of the nipples 
of a twin-valve social flask. I 
saw the level go down — Moonpull was strong enough for there 
to be a level — and saw his Adam's 
apple work. "Not too much," he 
cautioned me. "Touchdown's 
soon." 

I stalled with conversation for 
a few minutes, watching him, and 
then swallowed half a pint of 
hundred proof. I could hardly 
tow myself back to the compartment. I threw up and worked the 
air regenerator button in time to 
get most of it. 

I was fuzzily glad the stuff had 
stayed down long enough for the 
alcohol molecules to be picked 
out of the fluid and sent wandering through my body, bringing 
numbness to my limbs and forgetfulness to my brain. 

TTANGOVER, grief, fear and 
the maddening red tape of 
Moon debarkation. I must have 

1S5 



acted pretty stupid. A couple of 
times I heard the crewmen say 
to port officials something like: 
**Takc it easy on the guy. He lost 
his girl in flight." 

The line I took in the cramped 
receiving room of the endless 
questionnaires was that I didn't 
know anything about the mission. I was Groby, a 6, and the 
best thing to do would be to send 
mc to Fowler Schocken. I understood that we had been supposed 
to report to him. They poohpoohed that possibility and set 
me to wait on a bench while 
queries were sent to the Schocken 
branch in Luna City. 

T waited, watched and tried to 
■*■ think. It wasn't easy. The busy 
crowds in Receiving were made 
up of people going from one place 
to another place to do specified 
things. I didn't fit in the pattern; 
I was a sore thumb. They were 
going to get me . . . 

A tube popped and blinked 
at the desk yards away. I 
read between half closed eyes:

R-E Q-U-E-R-Y N-0 M -I-S-S-l-O-N

They were glancing at me from 
the desk and talking in low tones. 
In only a moment they would be 
beckoning the Burns Detective 
guards. 

I got up from the bench and 
sauntered into the crowd, with 
only one alternative left and that 
a frightening one. I made the 
casual gestures that, by their 
order and timing, constitute the 
Grand Hailing Sign of Distress 
of the Connies. 

A Burns guard shouldered his 
way through the crowd and put 
the arm on me. "Are you going 
to make trouble?" he growled. 

"No," I said thickly. "Lead the 
way." 

He gestured confidentially at 
the desk and they waved back, 
with grins. He marched me. with 
his nightstick in the small of my 
back, through the startled crowd. 
Numbly I let him take me from 
the receiving dome down a tunnel-like shopping street.

blinked and twinkled at me from 
the shopfronts as new arrivals 
shuffled up and down, gaping. 

"Hold it," growled the guard. 
We stepped in front of the Warren Astron sign. He muttered : 
"Twist the nightstick away from 
me. Hit me over the head with it. 
Fire one charge at the streetlight. 
Duck into Astron's and give him 
the grip. Good luck and try not 
to break my skull." 

"You're — you're — " I stammered. 

"Yeah. I wish I hadn't seen the 
hailing sign. This is going to cost 
me two stripes and a raise. Get 
moving." 

He surrendered the nightstick 
and I tried not to make it too 
easy or too hard when I clouted 
him. The buckshot charge 
boomed out of the stick's muzzle, 
shattered the light overhead and 
brought forth shrieks of dismay 
from the strollers. It was thunderous in the vaulted street. I 



darted through the chaste white 
Adams door of Astron's in the 
sudden darkness and blinked at 
a tall, thin man with a goatee. 

"What's the meaning of this?" 
he demanded. "I read by appointment — '* I took his arm in the 
grip. "Refuge?" he asked, abruptly, shedding a fussy professional 
manner. 

"Yes. Fast." 

He led me through his parlor 
into a small, high observatory 
with a transparent dome, a refracting telescope, Hindu star 
maps, clocks and desks. One of 
these desks he heaved at and it 
turned back on hinges. There was 
a pit and handholds. "Down you 
,go," he said. 

Down I went, into darkness. 

TT was some six feet deep and 
six by four in area. It had a 
rough, unfinished feel. A pick and 
shovel leaned against one wall, 
and a couple of buckets filled 
with Moon rock. Obviously work 
in progress. 

I inverted one of the buckets 
and sat down on it in the dark. 
After five hundred and seventysix counted pulse-beats, I sat on 
the floor, tried to brush Moon 
rock out of the way and lie down. 
I heard voices directly overhead. 
One was the primly professional 
voice of Astron. The other was 
the petulant voice of a woman. 
They seemed to be seated at the

desk directly above me. 

" — really seems excessive, Doctor." 

"As Madam wishes. If you will 
excuse me, I shall return to my 
ephemeris — " 

"But, Dr. Astron, I wasn't implying — *' 

"Madam will forgive me for 
jumping to the conclusion that 
she was unwilling to grant me my 
customary honorarium. That is 
correct. Now. please, the birth 
date and hour?" 

She mumbled them, and I wondered briefly about the problem 
Astron must have with women 
who shaded their years. 

"So . . , Venus in the hours of 
Mars . . . Mercury ascendant in 
the trine . , 

"What's that?" she asked with 
shrill suspicion. "I know quite a 
bit about the Great Art and I 
never heard that before." 

Blandly: "Madam must realize 
that a Moon observatory makes 
possible many things of which 
she has never heard before. It is 
possible by Lunar observations to 
refine the Great Art to a point 
unattainable in the days when 
observations were made perforce 
through the thick and muddled 
air of Earth." 

"Of course. Please go on, Dr. 
Astron. Will I be able to look 
through your telescope and . see 
my planets?" 

"Later, Madam. So . . . Mer



cury ascendant in the trine, the 
planet of strife and chicanery, 
yet quartered with Jupiter, the 
giver of fortune, so . . ." 

The "reading" lasted perhaps 
half an hour, and there were two 
more like it that followed, and 
then there was silence. I actually 
dozed off until a voice called me. 
The desk had been heaved back 
again and Astron's head was silhouetted against the opening. 
I climbed out stiffly, 
"You're Groby," he stated.

"Yes." 

"We got a report on you by 
courier aboard the Ricardo" I 
noticed that his hand was in his 
pocket. "You turn up in Chlorella, you're a natural-born copysmith, you're transferred to New 
York, you get kidnapped in front 
of the Met — in earnest or by prearrangrment — you kill a girl and 
disappear, and now you're on the 
Moon. God knows what you're 
up to. It's too much for me. A 
Central Committee member will 



be here shortly to try and figure 
you out. Is there anything you'd 
care to say? Like confessing that 
you're an agent provocateur?'* 
I said nothing. 

"Very well." Somewhere a door 
opened and closed. "That will be 
the Central Committee member.** 
And my wife Kathy walked 
into the observatory.
