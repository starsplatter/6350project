Friday — June 1 1 th 
A T three years of age, a 
little girl shouldn't have

Or, if she did it by accident, 
she surely shouldn't have enough 
reasoning ability to pick up one 
of her crayons and carefully trace 
the continuous line to prove it 
has only one surface.

And if by some strange coincidence she did, and it was still 
just an accident, how can I account for this generally active 
daughter of mine — and I do mean 
active — sitting for a solid half 
hour with her chin cupped in 
her hand, staring off into space, 
thinking with such concentration 
that it was almost painful to 
watch? 

I was in my reading chair, 
going over some work. Star was 
sitting on the floor, in the circle 
of my light, with her blunt-nosed 
scissors and her scraps of paper. 

Her long silence made me 
glance down at her as she was 
taping the two ends of the paper 
together. At that point I thought 
it was an accident that she had 
given a half twist to the paper 
strip before joining the circle. I 
smiled to myself as she picked 
it up in her chubby fingers. 

"A little child forms the enigma 
of the ages," I mused. 

But instead of throwing the 
strip aside, or tearing it apart as 
any other child would do, she 
carefully turned it over and 
around — studying it from all 
sides. 

Then she picked up one of her 
crayons and began tracing the 
line. She did it as though she 
were substantiating a conclusion 
already reached! 

It was a bitter confirmation 
for me. I had been refusing to 



face it for a long time, but I 
could ignore it no longer. 

Star was a High I.Q. 

For half an hour I watched 
her while she sat on the floor, 
cne knee bent under her, her 
chin in her hand, unmoving. Her 
eyes were wide with wonderment, 
looking into the potentialities off 
the phenomenon she had found. 

It has been a tough struggle, 
taking care of her since my wife's 
death. Now this added problem. 
If only she could have been normally dull, like other children! 

T made up my mind while I 
watched her. If a child is afflicted, then let's face it, she's 
afflicted. A parent must teach her 
to compensate. At least she could 
be prepared for the bitterness Vd 
known. She could learn early to 
take it in stride. 

I could use the measurements 
available, get the degree of intelligence, and in that way grasp the 
extent of my problem. A twenty 
point jump in I.Q. creates an entirely different set of problems. 
The 140 child lives in a world 
nothing at all like that of the 100 
child, and a world which the 120 
child can but vaguely sense. The 
problems which vex and challenge the 160 pass over the 140 
as a bird flies over a field mouse. 
I must not make the mistake of 
posing the problems of one if she 
is the other. I must know. In

the meantime, I must treat it 
casually. 

"That's called the Moebius 
Strip, Star," I interrupted her 
thoughts. 

She came out of her reverie 
with a start- I didn't like the 
quick way her eyes sought mine 
—almost furtively, as though she 
had been caught doing something 
bad. 

"Somebody already make it?" 
she disappointedly asked. 

She knew what she had discovered! Something inside me 
spilled over with grief, and something else caught at me with 
dread. 

I kept my voice casual.. "A 
man by the name of Moebius. A 
long time ago. I'll tell you about 
him sometime when you're older." 

"Now. While I'm little." she 
commanded with a frown. "And 
don't tell. Read me." 

What did she mean by that? 
Oh, she must be simply paraphrasing me at those times in 
the past when I've wanted the 
facts and not garbled generalizations. It could only be that! 

"Okay, young lady." I lifted 
an eyebrow and glared at her in 
mock ferociousness, which usually sent her into gales of laughter. "I'll slow you down!" 

She remained completely sober. 

I turned to the subject in a 
physics book. It's not in simple 
language, by any means, and I 



read it as rapidly £S I could 
speak. My thought was to make 
her admit she didn't understand 
it, so I could translate it into 
basic language. 
Her reaction? 

"You read too slow. Daddy," 
she complained. She was childishly irritable about it. "You say 
a word. Then I think a long time. 
Then you say another word." 

I knew what she meant. I remember, when I was a child, my 
thoughts used to dart in and out 
among the slowly droning words 
of any adult. Whole patterns of 
universes would appear and disappear in those brief moments. 

"So?" I asked. 

"So," she mocked me impishly. 
"You teach me to read. Then 
I can think quick as I want." 

"Quickly," I corrected in a 
weak voice. "The word is 
'quickly,' an adverb." 

She looked at me impatiently, 
as if she saw through this allegedly adult device to show up 
a younger's ignorance. I felt like 
the dope! 

September 1st 
A GREAT deal has happened 
the past few months. I have 
tried, a number of times to bring 
the conversation around to discuss Star's affliction with her. But 
she is amazingly adroit at heading me off, as though she already 
knows what I am trying to say 



* 




 



and isn't concerned. Perhaps, in 
spite of her brilliance, she's too 
young to realize the hostility of 
the world toward intelligence. 

Some of the visiting neighbors 
have been amused to see hex sit 
on the floor with an encyclopedia 
as big as she is. rapidly turning 
the pages. Only Star and I know 
she is reading the pages as rapidly 
as she can turn them. I've brushed 
away the neighbors' comments 
with: "She likes to look at the 
pictures." 

They talk to her in baby talk 
— and she answers in baby talk! 
How does she know enough to 
do that? 

I have spent the months making an exhaustive record of 
her I.Q. measurements, aptitude 
speeds, reaction, tables, all the 
recommended paraphernalia for 
measuring something we know 
nothing about. 

The tables are screwy, or Star 
is beyond all measurement. 

All right. Pete Holmes, how are 
you going to pose those problems 
and combat them for her, when 
you have no conception of what 
they might be? But I must have 
£ conception. I've got to be able 
to comprehend at least a little 
of what she may face. I simply 
couldn't stand by and do nothing. 

Easy, though. Nobody knows 
better than you the futility of trying to compete out of your class. 
How many students, workers and 



employers have tried to compete 
with you? You've watched them 
and pitied them, comparing them 
to a donkey trying to run the 
Kentucky Derby. 

How does it feel to be in the 
place of the donkey, for a change? 
You've always blamed them for 
hot realizing they shouldn't try 
to compete. 

But this is my own daughter! 
1 must understand. 

October I at 
OTAR is now four years old, 
^ and according to State Law 
her mind has now developed 
enough so that she may jiltehd 
nursery school. Again I tried to 
prepare her for what she might 
face. She listened through about 
two sentences and changed the 
subject. I can't tell about Star. 
Does she already know the an-, 
swers? Or does she not even realize there is a problem? 

I was in a sweat of worry when 
I took her to her first day at 
school yesterday morning. Last 
night J was sitting in my chair, 
reading. After she had put her 
dolls away, she went to the bookshelves and brought down a book 
of fairy tales. 

That is another peculiarity of 
hers. She has an immeasurably 
quick perception, yet she has all 
the normal reactions of a little 
girl. She likes her dolls, fairy 
stories, playing grown up. No, 



STAR, BRIGHT

she's not a monster. 

She brought the book of fairy 
tales over to me. 

"Daddy, read me a story," she 
asked quite seriously. 

I looked at her in amazement. 
"Since when? Go read your own 
story." 

She lifted an eyebrow in imitation of my own characteristic 
gesture. 

"Children of my age do not 
read," she instructed pedantically. 
"I can't learn to read until I am 
in the first grade. It is very hard 
to do and I am much too little." 

She had found the answer to 
her affliction — conformity! She 
had already learned to conceal 
her intelligence. So many of us 
break our hearts before we learn 
that. 

But you don't have to conceal 
it from me, Star! Not from me! 

Oh, well, I could go along with 
the gag. if that was what she 
wanted. 

"Did you like nursery school?" 
I asked the standard question. 

"Oh, yes," she exclaimed enthusiastically. "It was fun." 

"And*what did you learn today, little girl?" 

She played it straight back to 
me. "Not much. I tried to cut out 
paper dolls, but the scissors kept 
slipping." Was there an elfin deviltry back of her sober expression? 

"Now, look," I cautioned, 
"don't overdo it. That's as bad 



as being too quick. The idea is 
that everybody has to be just 
about standard average. That's 
the only thing we will tolerate. It 
is expected that a little girl of 
four should know how to cut out 
paper dolls properly." 

"Oh?" she questioned, and 
looked thoughtful. "I guess that's 
tiie hard part, isn't it, Daddy — to 
know how much you ought to 
know?" 

"Yes, that's the hard part," I 
agreed fervently. 

"But it's all right," she reassured me. "One of the Stupids 
showed me how to cut them out, 
so now that little girl likes me. 
She just took charge of me then 
and told the other kids they 
should like me, too. So of course 
they did because she's leader. I 
think I did right, after all." 

"Oh, no!" I breathed to myself. 
She knew how to manipulate 
other people already. Then my 
thought whirled around another 
concept. It was the first time she 
had verbally classified normal 
people as "Stupids," but it had 
slipped out so easily that I knew 
she'd been thinking to herself for 
a long time. Then my whirling 
thoughts hit a third implication. 

"Yes, maybe it was the right 
thing," I conceded. "Where the 
little girl was concerned, that is. 
But don't forget you were being 
observed by a grownup teacher 
in the room. And she's smarter." 



I 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"You mean she's older, 
Daddy," Star corrected me. 

"Smarter, too, maybe. You 
can't tell." 

"I can," she sighed. "She's just 
older." 

I think it was growing fear 
which made me defensive. 

"That's good," I said emphatically. "That's very good. You 
can learn a lot from her then. It 
takes an awful lot of study to 
learn how to be stupid." 

My own troublesome business 
life came to mind and I thought 
to myself, "I sometimes think I'll 
never learn it." 

I swear I didn't say it aloud. 
But Star patted me consolingly 
and answered as though I'd 
spoken. 

"That's because you're only 
fairly bright, Daddy. You're a 
Tween, and that's harder than 
being really bright." 

"A Tween? What's a Tween?" 
I was bumbling to hide my confusion. Nfc 

"That's what I mean, Daddy," 
she answered in exasperation. 
"You don't grasp quickly. An 
In Between, of course. The. other 
people are Stupids, I'm a Bright, 
and you're a Tween. I made those 
names up when I was little." 

Good God! Besides being unmeasurably bright, she's a telepath ! 

All right, Pete, there you are. 
On reasoning processes you might 



stand a chance — but not telepathy! 

"Star," I said on impulse, "can 
you read people's minds?" 

"Of course, Daddy," she answered, as if I'd asked a foolishly obvious question*' 

"Can you teach me?" 

She looked at me impishly. 
"You're already learning it a 
little. But you're so slow! You 
see, you didn't even know you 
were learning." 

Her voice took on a wistful 
note, a tone of loneliness. 

"I wish — " she said, and 
paused. 

"What do you wish?" 

"You see what I mean, Daddy? 
You try, but you're so slow." 

All the same, I knew. I knew 
she was already longing for a 
companion whose mind could 
match her own. 

A father is prepared to lose 
his daughter eventually, Star, but 
not so soon. 

Not so soon . . . 

/une_ again 

SOME new people have moved 
in next door. Star says their 
name is Howell. Bill and Ruth 
Howell. They have a son, Robert, 
who looks maybe a year older 
than Star, who will soon be five. 

Star seems to have taken up 
with Robert right away. He is 
a well-mannered boy and good 
company for Star. 



STAR, 



BRIGHT 



I'm worried, though. Star had 
something to do with their moving in next door. I'm convinced 
of that. I'm also convinced, even 
from the little I've seen of him, 
that Robert is a Bright and a 
telepath. 

Could it be that, failing to find 
quick accord with my mind, Star 
has reached out and out until 
she made contact with a telepath 
companion? 

No. that's too fantastic. Even 
if it were so. how could she shape 
circumstances so she could bring 
Robert to live next door to her? 
The Howells came from another 
city. It just happened that the 
people who lived next door moved 
out and the house was put up 
for sale. 

Just happened? How frequently 
do we find such abnormal 
Bl ights? What are the chances of 
one just happening to move in 
next door to another? 

I know he is a telepath because, 
as I write this, I sense him reading it. 

I even catch his thought: "Oh, 
pardon me, Mr. Holmes. I didn't 
intend to peek. Really I didn't." 

Did I imagine that? Or is Star 
building a skill in my mind? 

"It isn't nice to look into another person's mind unless you're 
asked, Robert," I thought back, 
rather severely. It was purely an 
experiment. 

"I know it, Mr. Holmes. 1 



apologize." He is in his bed in his 

house, across the driveway. 

"No, Daddy, he really didn't 
mean to." And Star is in her bed 
in this house. 

It is impossible to write how I 
feel. There comes a time when 
words are empty husks. But 
mixed with my expectant dread 
is a thread of gratitude for having 
been taught to be even stumblingly telepathic. 

Saturday — August I Ith 

I'VE thought of a gag. I haven't 
seen Jim Pietre in a month of 
Sundays, not since he was 
awarded that research fellowship 
with the museum. It will be good 
to pull him out of his hole, and 
this little piece of advertising 
junk Star dropped should be just 
the thing. 

Strange about the gadget. The 
Awful Secret Talisman of the 
Mystic Junior G-Men, no doubt. 
Still, it doesn't have anything 
about crackles and pops printed 
on it. Merely an odd-looking 
coin, not even true round, bronze 
by the look of it. Crude. They 
must stamp them out by the 
million without ever changing a 
die. 

But it is just the thing to send 
to Jim to get a rise out of him. 
He could always appreciate a 
good practical joke. Wonder how 
he'd feel to know he was only a 
Tween.

Monday — August 13fA 

SITTING here at my study 
desk, I've been staring into 
space for an hour. I don't know 
what to think. 

It was about noon today when 
Jim Pietre called the office on 
the phone. 

- "Now, look, Pete," he started 
out. "What kind of gag are you 
pulling?" 

I chortled to myself and pulled 
the dead pan on him. 

"What do you mean, boy?" I 
asked back into the phone. "Gag? 
What kind of gag? What are you 
talking about?" 

"A coin. A coin." He was impatient. "You remember you sent 
me a coin in the mail?" 

"Oh, yeah, that," I pretended 
to remember. "Look, you're an 
important research analyst on 
metals — too damned important 
to keep in touch with your old 
friends — so I thought I'd make a 
bid for yoijr attention thataway." 

"All right, give," he said in a 
low voice. "Where did you get 
it?" He was serious. 

"Come off it, Jim. Are you 
practicing to be a stuffed shirt? 
I admit it's a rib. Something Star 
dropped the other day. A manufacturer's idea of kid advertising, 
no doubt." 

"I'm in dead earnest, Peter," he 
answered. "It's no advertising 
gadget." 

"It means something?" 



In college, Jim could take s 
practical joke and make six out 
of it. 

"I don't know^what it means. 
Where did Star get it?" He was 
being pretty crisp about it. 

"Oh, I don't know," I said. I 
was getting a little fed up; the 
joke wasn't going according to 
plan. "Never asked her. You 
know how kids clutter u p the 
place with their things. No father 
even tries to keep track of all the 
junk that can be bought with 
three box tops and a dime." 

"This was not bought with 
three box tops and a dime," he 
spaced his words evenly. "This 
was not bought anywhere, for 
any price. In fact, if you want 
to be logical about it, this coin 
doesn't exist at all." 

I laughed out loud. This was 
more like the old Jim. 

"Okay, so you've turned the 
gag back on me. Let's call it 
quits. How about coming over 
to supper some night soon?" 

"I'm coming over, my friend." 
He remained grim as he said it. 
"And I'm coming over tonight. 
As soon as you will be home. 
It's no gag I'm pulling. Can you 
get that through your stubborn 
head? You say you got it from 
Star, and of course I believe you. 
But it's no toy. Ifs the real 
thing." Then, as if in profound 
puzzlement, "Only it isn't." 

A feeling of dread was settling 



STAR, BRIGHT 



upon me. Once you cried "Uncle" 
to Jim, he always let up. 

"Suppose you tell me what you 
mean," I answered soberly. 

"That's more like it, Pete. 
Here's what we know about the 
coin so far. It is apparently preEsyptian. It's hand-cast. It's 
made out of one of the lost 
bronzes. We fix it at around four 
thousand years old." 

"That ought to be easy to 
solve," I argued. "Probably some 
coin collector is screaming all 
over the place for it. No doubt 
lost it and Star found it. Must be 
lots of old coins like that in museums and in private collections." 

I was rationalizing more for 
my own benefit than for Jim. He 





would know all those things without my mentioning them. He 
waited until I had finished. 

"Step two/' he went on. "We've 
got one of the top coin men in 
the world here at the museum. 
As soon as I saw what the metal 
was, I took it to him. Now hold 
onto your chair. Pete. He says 
there is no coin like it in the 
world, either museum or private 
collection." 

"You museum boys get beside 
yourselves at times. Come down 
to Earth. Sometime, somewhere, 
some collector picked it up in 
some exotic place and kept it 
quiet. I don't have to tell you 
how some collectors are — sitting 
in a dark room, gloating over 
some worthless bauble, not Idling 
a soul about it — " 



It 




 



"All right, wise guy," he interrupted. "Step three. That coin 
is at least four thousand years 
old and it's also brand-new! Let's 
hear you explain that away." 

"New?" I asked weakly. "I 
don't get it." 

"Old coins show wear. The 
edges get rounded with handling. 
The surface oxidizes. The molecular structure changes, crystalizes. This coin shows no wear, no 
oxidation, no molecular change. 
This coin might have been struck 
yesterday. Where did Star get 
it?" 

"Hold it a minute," I pleaded. 

I began to think back. Saturday 
morning. Star and Robert had 
been playing a game. Come to 
think of it, that was a peculiar 
game. Mighty peculiar. 

Star would run into the house 
and stand in front of the encyclopedia shelf. I could hear Robert counting loudly at the base 
tree outside in the back yard. She 
would stare at the encyclopedia 
for a moment. 

Once I heard her mumble : 
"That's a good place." 

Or maybe she merely thought 
it and I caught the thought. 
I'm doing that quite a bit of late. 

Then she would run outside 
again. A moment later, Robert 
would run in and stand in front 
of the same shelf. Then he also 
would run outside again. There 



would be silence for several minutes. The silence would rupture 
with a burst of laughing and 
shouting. Soon, Star would come 
in again. 

"How does he find me?" I 
heard her think once. "I can't 
reason it, and I can't ESP it out 
of him." 

It was during one of their silences when Ruth called over to 
me. 




"Hey, Pete! Do you know 
where the kids are? Time for their 
milk and cookies." 

The Howells are awfully good 
to Star, bless 'em. I got up and 
went over to the window. 

*'I don't know, Ruth," I called 
back. "They were in and out only 
a few minutes ago." 

"Well, I'm not worried," she 



STAR, BRIGHT 



said. She came through the 
kitchen door and stood on 
the back steps. "They know better 
than to cross the street by themselves. They're too little for that. 
So I guess they're over at Marily's. When they come back, tell 
'em to come and get it." 

"Okay, Ruth," I answered. 

She opened the screen door 
again and went back into her 
kitchen. I left the window and 
returned to my work. 

A little later, both the kids 
came running into the house. I 
managed to capture them long 
enough to tell them about the 
cookies and milk. 

"Beat you there ! '* Robert 
shouted to Star. 

There was a scuffle and they 
ran out the front door. I noticed 
then that Star had dropped the 
coin and I picked it up and sent 
it to Jim Pietre. 

"¥TELLO, Jim," I said into the 
-^-l phone. "Are you still 
there?" 

"Yep, still waiting for an answer," he said. 

"Jim, I think you'd better come 
over to the house right away. I'll 
leave my office now and meet 
you there. Can you get away?" 
' "Can I get away?" he exclaimed. "Boss says to trace this 
coin down and do nothing else. 
See you in fifteen minutes." 

He hung up. Thoughtfully, I 



replaced the receiver and went 
out to my car. I was pulling into 
my block from one arterial when 
I saw Jim's car pulling in from 
a block away. I stopped at the 
curb and waited for him. I didn't 
see the kids anywhere out front. 

Jim climbed out of his car, 
and I never saw such an eager 
look of anticipation on a man's 
face before. I didn't realize I was 
showing my dread, but when he 
saw my face, he became serious. 

"What is it, Pete? What on 
Earth is it?" he almost whispered. 

"I don't know. At least I'm not 
sure. Come' on inside the house." 

We let ourselves in the front, 
and I took Jim into the study. It 
has a large window opening on the 
back garden, and the scene was 
very clear. 

At first it was an innocent scene 
— so innocent and peaceful. Just 
three little children in the back 
yard playing hide and seek. Marily, a neighbor's child, was stepping up to the base tree. 

"Now look, you kids," she was 
saying. "You hide where I can 
find you or I won't play." 

"But where can we go, Marily?" Robert was arguing loudly. 
Like all little boys, he seems to 
carry on his conversations at the 
top of his lungs. "There's the garage, and there's those trees and 
bushes. You have to look everywhere, Marily." 

"And there's goirft to be other 



\4 




 



buildings and trees and bushes 
there afterward," Star called out 
with glee. "You gotta look behind them, too." 

"Yeah!" Robert took up the 
teasing refrain. "And there's been 
lots and lots of buildings and 
trees there before — especially 
trees. You gotta look behind 
them, too." 

Marily tossed her head petulantly. "I don't know what you're 
talking about, and I don't care. 
Just hide where I can find you, 
that's all." 

She hid her face at the tree 
and started counting. If I had 
been alone, I would have been 
sure my eyesight had failed me, 
or that I was the victim of hallucinations. But Jim was standing 
there and saw it, too. 

Marily started counting, yet 
the other two didn't run away. 
Star reached out and took Robert's hand and they merely stood 
there. For an instant, they seemed 
to shimmer and — they disappeared without moving a step! 

Marily finished her counting 
and ran around to the few possible hiding places in the yard. 
When she couldn't find them, she 
started to blubber and pushed 
through the hedge to Ruth's back 
door. 

"They runned away from me 
again," she whined through the 
screen at Ruth. 

Jim and I stood staring out the 



window. I glanced at him. His 
face was set and pale, but probably no worse than nty own. 

We saw the instant shimmer 
again. Star, and then immediately 
Robert, materialized from the air 
and ran up to the tree, shouting, 
"Safe! Safe!" 

Marily let out a bawl and 
ran home to her mother. 

T CALLED Star and Robert 

into the house. They came, 
still holding hands, a little 
shamefaced, a little defiant. 

How to begin? What in hell 
could I say? 

"It's not exactly fair." I told 
them. "Marily can't follow you 
there." I was shooting in the dark, 
but I had at least a glimmering 
to go by. 

Star turned pale enough for the 
freckles on her little nose to stand 
out under her tan. Robert blushed 
and turned to her fiercely. 

"I told you so, Star. I told you 
so! I said it wasn't sporting," he 
accused. He turned to me. "Marily can't play good hide-and-seek 
anyway. She's only a Stupid." 

"Let's forget that for a minute, 
Robert." I turned to her. "Star, 
just where do you go?" 

"Oh, it's nothing, Daddy." 
She spoke defensively, belittling 
the whole thing. "We just go a 
little ways when we play with 
her. She ought to be able to find 
us a little ways." 



STAR, BRIGHT 



"That's evading the issue. 
Where do you go — and how do 
you go?" 

Jim stepped forward and 
showed her the bronze coin I'd 
sent him. 

"You see. Star," he said 
quietly. "We've found this." 

"I shouldn't have to tell you 
my game." She was almost in 
k;ns. "You're both just Tweens. 
You couldn't understand." Then, 
struck with contrition, she turned 
to me. "Daddy, I've tried and 
tried to ESP you. Truly I did. 
But you don't ESP worth anything." She slipped her hand 
through Robert's arm. "Robert 
does it very nicely," she said 
primly, as though she were complimenting him on using his fork 
the right way. "He must be better 
than I am, because I don't know 
how he finds me." 

"I'll tell you how I do it, Star," 
Robert exclaimed eagerly. It was 
as if he were trying to make 
amends now that grownups had 
caught on. "You don't use any 
imagination. I never saw anybody 
with so little imagination!" 

"I do. too, have imagination," 
she countered loudly. "I thought 
up the game, didn't I? I told you 
how to do it, didn't I?" 

"Yeah, yeah!" he shouted back. 
"But you always have to look 
at a book to ESP what's in it, so 
you leave an ESP smudge. I 
just go to the encyclopedia and 



ESP where you did— and I go 
to that place — and there you are. 
It's simp.le." 

Star's mouth dropped open in 
consternation. 

"I never thought of that," she 
said. 

Jim and I stood there, letting 
the meaning of what they were 
saying penetrate slowly into our 
incredulous minds. 

"Anyway," Robert was saying, 
"you haven't any imagination." 
He sank down cross-legged on the 
floor. "You can't ttleport yourself 
to any place that's never been." 

She went over to squat down 
beside him. "I can, too ! What 
about the Moon People? They 
haven't been yet." 

He looked at her with childish 
disgust. 

"Oh, Star, they have so been, 
You know that." He spread his 
hands out as though he were a 
baseball referee. "That time 
hasn't been yet for your daddy 
here, for instance, but it's already been for somebody likewell, say, like those things from 
Arcturus." 

"Well, neither have you teleported yourself to some place that 
never was," Star was arguing 
back. "So there." 

WAVING Jim to one chair, I 
sank down shakily into another. At least the arms of the 
chair felt solid beneath my hands. 




 



"Now, look, kids," I interrupted 
their evasive tactics. "Let's start 
at the beginning. I gather you've 
figured a way to travel to places 
m the pasTor future." 

"Well, of course. Daddy." Star 
shrugged the statement aside 
nonchalantly. "We just TP ourselves by ESP anywhere we want 
to go. It doesn't do any harm." 

And these were the children 
who were too little to cross the 
street ! * 

I have been through times of 
shock before. This was the same 
—somehow, the mind becomes 
too stunned to react beyond a 
point. One simply plows through 
the rest, the best he can, almost 
normally. 

"Okay, okay," I said, and was 
surprised to hear the same tone 
I would have used over an argument about the biggest piece of 
cake. "I don't know whether it's 
harmful or not. I'll have to think 
it over. Right now, just tell me 
how you do it." 

"It would be so much easier if 
I could ESP it to you," Star said 
doubtfully. 

"Well, pretend I'm a Stupid 
and tell me in words." 

"You remember the Moebius 
S tri p ?" she ask ed very slowl y 
and carefully, starting with the 
first and most basic point in almost the way one explains to an 
ordinary child. 

Yes, I remembered it. And I 



remembered how long ago it was 
that she had discovered it. Over 
a year, and her busy, brilliant 
mind had been exploring its possibilities ever since. And I thought 
she had forgotten it! 

"That's where you join the 
ends of a strip of paper together 
with a half twist to make one surface," she went on, as though 
jogging my undependable, slow 
memory. 

"Yes." I answered. "We all 
know the Moebius Strip." 

Jim looked startled. I had 
never told him about the incident. 

"Next you take a sheet and 
you give it a half twist and join 
the edge to itself all over to make 
a funny kind of holder." 

"Klein's Bottle," Jim supplied. 

She looked at him in relief. 

"Oh, you know about that." 
she said. "That makes it easier. 
Well, then, the next step. You 
take a cube" — Her face clouded 
with doubt again, and she explained, "You can't do this with 
your hands. You've gotta ESP it 
done, because it's an imaginary 
cube anyway." 

She looked at us questioningly. 
I nodded for her to continue. 

"And you ESP the twisted cube 
all together the same way you 
did Klein's Bottle. Now if you do 
that big enough, all around you, 
so you're sort of half twisted in 
the middle, then you can TP 
yourself anywhere you want to 



STAR, BRIGHT

go. And that's all there is to it,** 
she finished hurriedly. 

"Where have you gone?" I 
asked her quietly. 

T ■ 1 




klein's bottle 



The technique of doing it would 
take some thinking. I knew 
enough physics to know that was 
the way the dimensions were built 
up. The line, the plane, the cube 
— Euclidian physics. The Moebius Strip, the Klein Bottle, the 
unnamed twisted cube — Einsteinian physics. Yes, it was possible. 

"Oh, we've gone all over," Star 
answered vaguely. "The Romans 
and the Egyptians — places like 
that." 

"You picked up a coin in one 
of those places?" Jim asked. 

He was doing a good job of 
keeping his voice casual. I knew 
the excitement he must be feeling, 
the vision of the wealth of knowl


edge which must be opening be
for his eyes. 

"I found it, Daddy," Star answered Jim's question. She was 
about to cry. "I found it in the 
dirt, and Robert was about to 
catch me. I forgot I*had it when 
I went away from there so fast." 
She looked at me pleadingly. "I 
didn't mean to steal it. Daddy. 
I never stole anything, anywhere. 
And I was going to take it back 
and put it right where I found it. 
Truly I was. But I dropped it 
again, and then I ESP'd that you 
had it. I guess I was awful 
naughty." 

I brushed my hand across my 
forehead. ' 

"Let's skip the question of good 
tnd bad for a minute," I said, 
my head tb robbing. "What about 
this business of going into the 
future?" 

TJOBERT spoke up. his tytn 
shining. "There isn't any future, Mr. Holmes. That's what I 
keep telling Star, but she can't 
reason — she's just a girl. It'll all 
pass. Everything is always past." 

Jim stared at him, as though 
thunderstruck, and opened his 
mouth in protest. I shook my 
head warningly. 

"Suppose you tell me about 
that, Robert," I said. 

"Well," he began on a rising 
note, frowning, "it's kinda hard 
to explain at that. Star's a Bright 




 



and even she doesn't understand 

it exactly. But, you see, I'm 
older." He looked at her with 
superiority. Then, with a change 
of mood, he defended her. "But 
when she gets as old as I am, 
she'll understand it okay." 

He patted her shoulder consolingly. He was all of six years 
old. * 

"You go back into the past. 
Back past Egypt and Atlantis. 
That's recent," he said with scorn. 
"And on back, and on back, and 
alt of a sudden it's future." 

"That isn't the way / did it." 
Star tossed her head contrarily. 
"I reasoned the future. I reasoned 
what would come next, and I 
went there, and then I reasoned 
again. And on and on. I can, too, 
reason." 

"It's the same future," Robert 
told us dogmatically. "It has to 
be, because that's all that ever 
happened ." He turned to Star. 
"The reason you never could find 
any Garden of Eden is because 
there wasn't any Adam and Eve.** 
Then to me, "And man didn't 
come from the apes, either. Man 
started himself." 

Jim almost strangled as he 
leaned forward, his face red and 
his eyes bulging. 

"How?" he choked out. 

Robert sent his gaze into the 
far distance. 

"Well," he said, "a long time 
from now — you know what I 



mean, as a Stupid would think 

of Time-From-Now ■ — men got 
into a mess. Quite a mess — 

"There were some people in 
that time who figured out the 
same kind of traveling Star and. 
I do. So when the world was 
about to blow up and form a new 
star, a lot of them teleported 
themselves back to when the 
Earth was young, and they 
started over again." 

Jim just stared at Robert, unable to speak. 

"I don't get it," I said. 

"Not everybody could do it,** 
Robert explained patiently. "Just 
a few Brights. But they enclosed 
a lot of other people and took 
them along." He became a little 
va'guc at this point. "I guess later 
on the Brights lost interest in the 
Stupids or something. Anyway, 
the Stupids sank down lower and 
lower and became like animals.** 
He held his nose briefly. "They 
smetled worse. They worshiped 
the Brights as gods." 

Robert looked at me and • 
shrugged. 

"I don't know all that hap- , 
pened. I've only been there a 
few times. It's not very interesting. Anyway," he finished, "the 
Brights finally disappeared." 

"I'd sure like to know where 
they went," Star sighed. It was a 
lonely sigh. I helplessly took her 
hand and gave my attention back 
to Robert, 



STAR, IRIGHT 



It 



"I still don't quite understand," 
I said. 

He grubbed up some scissors, a 
piece of cellophane tape, a sheet 
of paper. Quickly he cut a strip, 
gave it a half twist, and taped it 
together. Then rapidly, on the 
Moebius Strip, he wrote: "Cave 
men. This men. That men, Mu 
Men. Atlantis Men, Egyptians. 
History Men, Us Now Men, Atom 
Men, Moon Men, Planet Men, 
Star Men — " 

"There," he said. "That's all 
the room there is on the strip. 
I've written clear around it. Right 
after Star Men comes Cave Men. 
It's all one thing, joined together. 
It isn't future, and it isn't past, 
either. It just plain is. Don*t you 
see?" 

"I'd sure like to know how the 
Brights got off the strip," Star 
said wistfully. 

T HAD all I could take. 

^ "Look, kids," I pleaded. "I 

don't know whether this game's 

dangerous or not. Maybe you'll 

wind up in a lion's mouth, or 

something." 

"Oh, no, Daddy!" Star shrilled 
in glee. "We'd just TP ourselves 
right out of there." 

"But fast," Robert chortled in 
agreement. 

"Anyway, I've got to think it 
over," I said stubbornly. "I'm 
only a Tvveen, but, Star, I'm your 
daddy and you're just a little 



girl, so you have to mind me." 

"I always mind you." she said 
virtuously. 

"You do, eh?" I asked. "What 
about going off the block? Visiting the Greeks and Star Men 
isn't my idea of staying on the 
block." 

"But you didn't say that, 
Daddy. You said not to cross the 
street. And I never did cross the 
street. Did we, Robert? Did we?" 

"We didn't cross a single street, 
Mr. Holmes," he insisted. 

"My God!" said Jim, and he 
went on trying to light a cigarette. 

"All right, all right! No more 
leaving this time, then," I warned. 

"Wait!" It was a cry of anguish from Jim. He broke the 
cigarette in sudden frustration 
and threw it in an ashtray. "The 
museum, Pete," he pleaded. 
"Think what it would mean. 
Pictures, specimens, voice recordings. And not only from historical places, but Star men, 
Pete. Star men! Wouldn't it be 
all right for them to go places 
they know are safe? I wouldn't 
ask them to take risks, but — " 

"No, Jim," I said regretfully. 
"It's your museum, but this is 
my daughter." 

"Sure," he breathed. "I guess 
I'd feel the same way," 

I turned back to the youngsters. 

"Star, Robert," I said to them 
both, "I want your promise thet 



20 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you will not leave this time, until 
I let you. Now I couldn't punish 
you if you broke your promise, 
because I couldn't follow you. 
But I want your promise on your 
word of honor you won't leave 
this time." 

"We promise." They each held 
up a hand, as if swearing in 
court. "No more leaving this 
time." 

I let the kids go back outside 
into the yard. Jim and I looked 
at one another for a long while, 
breathing hard enough to have 
been running. 

"I'm sorry,'.' I said at last. 

"I know," he answered. "So am 
I. But I don't blame you. I simply 
forgot, for a moment, how much 
a daughter could mean to a man.*' 
He was silent, and then added, 
with the humorous quirk back 
at the corner of his lips, "I can 
just see myself reporting this interview to the museum." 

"You don't intend to. do you?" 
I asked, alarmed. 

"And get myself canned or 
laughed at? I'm not that stupid." 

September lOf/t 
AMI actually getting it? I had 
a flash for an instant. I was 
concentrating on Caesar's triumphant march into Rome. For 
the briefest of instants, there it 
was. 1 I was standing on the roadway, watching. But, most peculiar, it was still a picture; I 



was the only thing moving. And 
then, just as abruptly, I lost it. 

Was it only a hallucination? 
Something brought about by intense concentration and wishful 
thinking? 

Now let's see. You visualize a 
cube. Then you ESP it a half 
twist and seal the edges together 
— No, when it has the half twist 
there's only one surface. You seal 
that surface all around you — 

Sometimes I think I have: it. 
Sometimes I despair. If only I 
were a Bright instead of a Tween! 

Ocfooer 23rd 
T DON'T see how I managed to 
make so much work of teleporting myself. It's the simplest 
thing in the world, no effort at 
all. Why, a child could do itl 
That sounds like a gag, considering that it was two children 
who showed me how, but I mean 
the whole thing is easy enough 
for even almost any kid to learn. 
The problem is understanding the 
steps . . . no, not understanding, 
because I can't say I do, but 
working out the steps in the 
process. 

There's no danger, either. No 
wonder it felt like a still picture 
at first, for the speeding up is 
incredible. That bullet I got in 
the way of, for instance — I was 
able to go and meet it and walk 
along beside it while it traveled 
through the air. To the men who 



STAR, 



BRIGHT 



were dueling, I must have been 
no more than an instantaneous 
streak of movement. 

That's why the youngsters 
laughed at the suggestion of danger. Even if they materialized 
right in the middle of an atomic 
blast, it is so slow by comparison 
that they could TP right out 
again before they got hurt. The 
blast can't travel any faster than 
the speed of light, you see, while 
there is no limit to the speed of 
thought. 

But I still haven't given them 
permission to teleport themselves 
out of this time yet. I want to go 
over the ages pretty carefully 
before I do; I'm not taking any 
chances, even though I don't see 
how they could wind up in any 
trouble. Still, Robert claimed the 
Brights went from the future back 
into the beginning, which means 
they could be going through time 
and overtake any of the three of 
us, and one of them might be 
hostile — 

I feel like a louse, not. taking 
Jim's cameras, specimen boxes 
and recorders along. But there's 
time for that. Plenty of time, once 
I get the feel of history without 
being encumbered by all th at 
stuff to carry. 

Speaking of time and history — 
what a rotten job historians have 
done! For instance: 

George III of England was 
neither crazy nor a moron. He 



wasn't a particularly nice guy, 
I'll admit — I don't see how anybody could be with the amount 
of flattery I saw — but he was the 
victim of empire expansion and 
the ferment of the Industrial 
Revolution. So were all the other 
European rulers at the time, 
though. He certainly did better 
than Louis of France. At least 
George' kept his job and his head. 

On the other hand, John Wilkes 
Booth was definitely psychotic. 
He could have been cured i f 
they'd had our methods of psychotherapy then, and Lincoln, of 
course, wouldn't have been assassinated. It was almost a compulsion to prevent the killing, but 
I didn't dare . . . God knows 
what effect it would have had on 
history. Strange thing, Lincoln 
looked less surprised than anybody else when he was shot, sad, 
yes, and hurt emotionally at least 
as much as physically, yet you'd 
swear he was expecting it. 

Cheops was plenty worried 
about the number of slaves who 
died while the pyramid was being built. They weren't easy to 
replace. He gave them four hours 
off in the hottest part of the day, 
and I don't think any slaves in 
the country were fed or housed 
better. 

I never found any signs of Atlantis or Lemuria, just tales of 
lands far off — a few hundred 
miles was a big distance then, re

member — that had sunk beneath 
the sea. With the Ancients' exaggerated notion of geography, 
a big island was the same as a 
continent. Some islands did disappear, naturally, drowning a 
few thousand villagers and herdsmen. That must have been the 
source of the legends. 

Columbus was a stubborn cuss. 
He was thinking of turning back 
when the sailors mutinied, which 
made him obstinate. I still can't 
see what was eating Genghis 
Khan and Alexander the Great — 
it would have been a big help to 
know the languages, because their 
big campaigns started off more 
like vacation or exploration trips. 
Helen of Troy was attractive 
enough, considering, but she was 
just an excuse to fight. 

There were several attempts to 
federate the Indian tribes before 
the white man and the Five Nations, but going after wives and 
slaves ruined the movement every 
time. I think they could have 
kept America if they had been 
united and, it goes without saying, knew the deal they were 
going to get. At any rate, they 
might have traded for weapons 
and tools and industrialized the 
country somewhat in the way the 
Japanese did. I admit that's only 
speculation, but this would certainly have b^en a different world 
if they'd succeeded! 

One day I'll put it all in a 



comprehensive and corrected history of mankind, complete with 
photographs, and then let the 
"experts" argue themselves into 
nervous breakdowns over it. 

I didn't get very far into the 
future. Nowhere near the Star 
Men, or, for that matter, back 
to the beginning that Robert told 
us about. It's a matter of reasoning out the path and I'm not a 
Bright. I'll take Robert and Star 
along as guides, when and if. 

What I did see of the future 
wasn't so good, but it wasn't so 
bad, either. The real mess obviously doesn't happen until the 
Star Men show up very far 
ahead in history, if Robert is 
right, and I think he is. I can't 
guess what the trouble will be, 
but it must be something ghastly 
if they won't be able to get out 
of it even with the enormously 
advanced technology they'll have. 
Or maybe that's the answer. It's 
almost true of us now. 

November, Friday 14fft 
*T*HE Howells have gone for a 
weekend trip and left Robert 
in my care. He's a good kid and 
no trouble. He and Star have kept 
their promise, but they're up to 
something else. I can sense it and 
that feeling of expectant dread 
is back with me. 

They've been secretive of late. 
I catch them concentrating intensely, sighing with vexation, 



STAR, MIGHT

snd then breaking out into unexplained giggles. 

"Remember your promise," I 
warned Star while Robert was in 
the room. 

"We're not going to break it, 
Daddy," she answered seriously. 

They both chorused, "No more 
leaving this time." 

But they both broke into 
giggles! 

I'll have to watch them. What 
good it would do, I don't know. 
They're up to something, yet how 
can I stop them? Shut them in 
their rooms? Tan their hides? 

I wonder what someone else 
would recommend. 

Sunday night 
f|TiHE kids are gone! 
•J- I've heen waiting an hour for 
them. I know they wouldn't stay 
away so long if they could get 
back. There must be something 
they've run into. Bright as they 
are, they're still only children. 

I have some clues. They promised me they wouldn't go out of 
thja present time. With all her 
misciiievousness, Star has never 
broken a promise to me — as her 
typically feminine mind interprets it, that is. So I know they 
are in our own time. 

On several occasions Star has 
brought it up, wondering where 
the Old Ones, the Bright Ones, 
have gone— how they got off the 
Moebius Strip. 



That's the clue. How can I get 
off the Moebius Strip and remain in the present? 

A cube won't do it. There we 
have a mere journey along the 
single surface. We have a line, 
we have a plane, we have a cube. 
And then we have a supercube — 
o tesseract. That is the logical 
progression of mathematics. The 
Bright Ones must have pursued 
that line of reasoning. 

Now I've got to do the same, 
but without the advantage of 
being a Bright. Still, it's not the 
same as expecting & normally in



TE55E R. ACT 



telligent person to produce a work 
of genius. (Genius by our standards, of course, which I suppose 
Robert and Star would classify 
as Tween.) Anyone with a pretty 
fair I.Q. and proper education 
and training can follow a genius's 
logic, provided the steps are there 



24 




 



and especially if it has a practical 
application. What he can't do is 
initiate and complete that structure of logic. I don't have to, 
either — that was done for me by 



a pair of Brights and I "simply" 
have to apply their findings. 

Now let's see if I can. 

By reducing the present-pastfuture of man to a Moebius Strip, 



STAR, BftlGHT 



25 



we have sheared away a dimension. It is a two-dimensional strip, 
because it has no depth. (Naturally, it would be impossible for 
a Moebius Strip to have depth; 
it has only one surface.) 

Reducing it to two dimensions 
makes it possible to travel anywhere you want to go on it via 
the third dimension. And you're 
in the third dimension when you 
enfold yourself in the twisted 
cube. 

Let's go a step higher, into 
one more dimension. In short, the 
tesseract. To get the equivalent 
of a Moebius Strip with depth, 
you have to go into the fourth 
dimension, which, it seems to me, 
is the only way the Bright Ones 
could get off this closed cycle 
of past-present-future-past. They 
must have reasoned that one 
more notch up the dimensions 
was all they needed. It is equally 
obvious ^hat Star and Robert 
have followed the same line of 
reasoning ; they wouldn't break 
their promise not to leave the 
present — and getting off the 
Moebius Strip into another present would, in a sort of devious 
way, be keeping that promise. 

I'm putting all this speculation 
down for you, Jim Pietre, knowing first that you're a Tween like 
myself, and second that you're 
sure to have been doing a lot of 
thinking about what happened 
after I sent you the coin Star 



dropped. I'm hoping you can explain all this to Bill and Ruth 
Howell— or enough, in any case, 
to let them understand the truth 
about their son Robert and my 
daughter Star, and where the 
children may have gone, 

I'm leaving these notes where y6u will find them, when you and 
Bill and Ruth search the house 
and grounds for us. If you read 
this, it will be because I have 
failed in my search for the 
youngsters. There is also the possibility that I'll find them and 
that we won't be able to get back 
onto this Moebius Strip. Perhaps 
time has a different value there, 
or doesn't exist at all. What it's 
like off the Strip is anybody's 
guess. 

Bill and Ruth: I wish I might 
give you hope that I will bring 
Robert back to you. But all I 
can do is wish. It may be no more 
than wishing upon a star — my 
Star. 

I'm trying now to take six 
cubes and fold them in on one 
another so that every angle is a 
right angle. 

It's not easy, but I can do it, 
using every bit of concentration 
I've learned from the kids. All 
right, I have the six cubes and I 
have every angle a right angle. 

Now if, in the folding, I ESP 
the tesseract a half twist around 
myself and —

faintly, a flattened oval of tunneling designed for multiple alien 
feet, lighted for faceted eyes demanding the merest fraction of 
tight necessary for an Earthman' s 
vision. For two yards Farrell 
could see dimly, as through a 
hea vy fog; beyond was nothing 
but darkness and an outlandish 
labyrinth of cross-branching corridors that spiraled on forever 
without end. 

Behind him, his pursuers — 
human natives or Hyme'nop invaders, he had no way of knowing which — drew nearer with a 
tit v minor rustling whose suggestion of imminent danger sent 
Farrell plunging blindly on into 
the maze. 

—To halt, sweating, when a 
20und exactly similar came to 
turn from ahead. 

It was what he had feared from 
the beginning. He could not go 
on, and he could not go back. 

He made out the intersecting 
corridor to his right, then a vague 
oval opening that loomed faintly 
grayer than the wall about it. He 
darted into it as into a sanctuary, 



and realized too late that the 

choice had been forced upon him. 

It had been intended from the 
start that he should take this 
way. He had been herded here 
like a halterless beast, driven by 
the steady threat of action never 
quite realized. They had known 
where he was going, and why. 

But there was light down there 
somewhere at the end of the tunnel's aimless wanderings. If, once 
there, he could see— 

He did not find light, only a 
lesser darkness. The tunnel led 
him into a larger place whose 
outer reaches were lost in shadow, but whose central area held 
a massive cylindrical machine at 
once alien and familiar. 

He went toward it hesitantly, 
confused for the moment by a 
paramnesiac sense of repeated 
experience, the specious recognition of deja vu. 

It was a Ringwave generator, 
and it was the thing he had ventured into the dome to find. 

His confusion stemmed from 
its resemblance to the disabled 
generator aboard the Marco Four, 
and from the stereo-sharp associations it evoked: Gibson working over the ship's power plant, 
his black-browed face scowling 
and intent, square brown body 
movi ng with a w res tier's easy 
economy of motion; Stryker t 
bald and fat and worried, wheeling up and down the companion

way from engine bay to chart 
room, his concern divided between Gibson's task and Farrell's 
Jong silence in the dome. 

Stryker at this moment would 
be regretting the congenital optimism that had prompted him to 
send his navigator where he him~ 
self could not go. Sweating anxiety would have replaced 
Stryker's pontifical assurance, 
dried up his smug pattering of 
socio- psychological truisms lifted 
from the Colonial Reclamations 
Handbook ... # 

"CJO far as adaptability is con^ cerned," Stryker had said an 
eternal evening before, "homo 
sapiens can be a pretty weird 
species. More given to mulish 
paradox, perhaps, than any alien 
life-form we're ever likely to run 
across out here." 

He had shifted his bulk comfortably on the grass under the 
Marco Four's open port, undisturbed by the busy clatter of 
tools inside the ship where Gibson and Xavier, the Marco's 
mechanical, worked over the disabled power plant. He laced his 
fingers across his fat paunch and 
peered placidly through the dusk 
at Farrell, who lay on his back, 
smoking and watching the stars 
grow bright in the evening sky. 

"Isolate a human colony from 
its parent planet for two centuries, enslave it for half that 



time to a hegemony as foreign 
as the Hymenops' hive-culture 
before abandoning it to its' own 
devices, and anything at all in 
the way of eccentric social controls can develop. But men remain basically identical, Arthur, 
in spite of acquired superficial 
changes. They are inherently incapable of evolving any system 
of control mechanisms that cannot be understood by other men, 
provided the environmental circumstances that brought that 
system into being arc known. At 
bottom, these Sadr III natives 
are no different from ourselves. 
Heredity won't permit it." 

Farrell, half listening, had been 
staring upward between the icy 
white brilliance of Deneb and 
the twin blue-and-yellow jewels 
of Albireo, searching for a remote 
twinkle of Sol. Five hundred 
light-years away out there, he 
was thinking, lay Earth. And 
from Earth all this gaudy alien 
glory was no more than another 
point of reference for backyard 
astronomers, a minor configuration casually familiar and unremarkable. 

A winking of lighted windows 
springing up in the village downslope brought his attention back 
to the scattered cottages by the 
river, and to the great disquieting 
curve of the Hymenop dome that 
rose above them like a giant 
above pygmies. He sat up rest

lessly, the wind ruffling his hair 
and whirling the smoke of his 
cigarette away in thin flying spirals. 

"You sound as smug as the 
Reorientation chapter you lifted 
that bit from," Farrell said. "But 
it won't apply here. Lee. The 
same thing happened to these 
people that happened to the other 
colonists we've found, but they 
don't reset the same. Either those 
Hymenop devils warped them 
permanently or they're a tribe of 
congenital maniacs." 

Stryker prodded him socratically : "Particulars?" 

"When we crashed here five 
weeks ago, there were an even 
thousand natives in the village, 
plus or minus a few babes in 
arms. Since that time they've lost 
a hundred twenty-six members, 
all suicides or mufflers. At first 
the entire population turned out 
at sunrise and went into the dome 
for an hour before going to the 
fields; since we came, that period 
has shortened progressively to a 
few minutes. That much we've 
learned by observation. By direct 
traffic we've learned exactly 
nothing except that they can 
speak Terran Standard, but 
won't. What sort of system is 
that?." 

Stryker tugged uncomfortably 
at the rim of white hair the years 
had left him. "It's a stumper for 
the moment, I'll admit . . * if 



they'd only talk to us, if they'd 
tell us what their wants and fears 
and problems are, we'd know 
what is wrong and what to do 
about it. But controls, forced on 
them by the Hymenops, or acquired since their liberation, seem 
to have altered their original 
ideology so radically that — " 

"That they're plain batty,'* 
Farrell finished for him. "The 
whole setup is unnatural. Lee. 
Consider this: We sent Xavier 
out to meet the first native that 
showed up, and the native talked 
to him. We heard it all by monitoring; his name was Tarvjl. he 
spoke Terran Standard, and he 
was amicable. Then we showed 
ourselves, and when he saw that 
we were human beings like himself and not mechanicals like Xav, 
he clammed up. So did everyone 
in the village. It worries me. Lee. 
If they didn't expect men to come 
out of the Marco, then what in 
God's name die/ they expect?" 

He sat up restlessly and stubbed out his cigarette. "It's an unimportant world anyway, all 
ocean except for this one small 
continent. I think we ought to 
write it off and pet the hell out 
as soon as the Marco's Ringwave 
is repaired." 

"We can't write it off," Stryker 
said. "Besides reclaiming a colony, we may have added a w> 
uable marine food source to the 
Federation. Arthur, you're not

letting a handful of disoriented 
people get under your skin, are 
you?" 

Farrell made an impatient 
sound and lit another cigarette. 
The brief flare of his lighter 
pierced the darkness and picked 
out a hurried movement a short 
stone's throw away, between the 
Marco Four and the village. 

"HpHERE'S one reason why I'm 
A edgy," Farrell said. "These 
Sadrians may be harmless, but 
they make a point of posting a 
guard over us. There's a sentry 
out there in the grass flats again 
tonight." He turned on Stryker 
uneasily. "I've watched on the 
infra-scanner while those sentries 
changed shifts, and they don't 
speak to each other. I've tracked 
them back to the village, but I've 
never seen one of them turn in 
a — " 

Down in the village a man 
screamed, a raw, tortured sound 
that brought both men up stiffly. 
A frantic drumming of running 
feet came to them, unmistakable 
across the little distance. The 
fleeing man came up from the 
dark huddle of cottages by 
the river and out across the grass 
flats, screaming. 

Pursuit overtook him halfway 
to the ship. There was a brief 
sculling, a shadowy dispersal of 
silent figures. After that, nothing. 

"They did it again," Farrell 



said. "One of them tried to come 
up here to us. The others killed 
him, and who's to say what sort 
of twisted motive prompted 
them? They go to the dome together every morning, not speaking. They work all day in the 
fields without so much as looking 
at each other. But every night at 
least one of them tries to escape 
from the village and come up 
here — and this is what happens. 
We couldn't trust them, Lee, 
even if we could understand 
them!" 

"It's our job to understand 
them," Stryker said doggedly. 
"Our function is to find colonies 
disoriented by the Hymenops 
and to set them straight if we can. 
If wc can't, we call in a longterm reorientation crew, and 
within three generations the culture will pass again for Terran. 
The fact that slave colonies invariably lose their knowledge of 
longevity helps; they don't get it 
back until they're ready for it. 

"I've seen some pretty foul results of Hymenop experimenting 
on human colonies, Arthur. There 
was the ninth planet of Beta 
Pegasi — rediscovered in 3910, I 
think it was — that developed a 
religious fixation on fertility, a 
mania fostered by the Hymenops 
to supply expendable labor for 
their mines. The natives stopped 
mining when the Hymenops gave 
up the invasion and went back to 



37 




 



70 Ophiuchi, but they were still 
multiplying like rabbits when we 
found them. They followed a 
cultural conviction something 
like that observed in Oriental 
races of ancient Terran history, 
but they didn't pursue the Oriental tradition of sacrosancts. They 
couldn't — there were too many 
of them. By the time they were 
found, they numbered fourteen 
billions and they were eating 
each other. Still it took only three 
generations to set them straight." 

He took one of Farrell's cigarettes and puffed it placidly. 

"For that matter, Earth had 
her own share of eccentric cultures. I recall reading about one 
that existed as late as the twentieth century and equaled anything we're likely to find here. 
Any society should be geared to 
a set of social controls designed 
to furnish it, as a whole with 
a maximum of pleasure and a 
minimum of discomfort, but 
these ancient Terrestrial Dobuans — island aborigines, as I remember it — had adjusted to their 
total environment in a manner 
exactly opposite. They reversed 
the norm and became a society of 
paranoiacs, hating each other in 
direct ratio to nearness of relationship. Husbands and wives 
detested each other, sons and 
fathers — *' 

"Now you're pulling my leg," 
Farrell protested. "A society like 



that would be too irrational ic 

function." 

"But the system worked," Stryker insisted. "It balanced well 
enough, as long as they were isolated. They accepted it because it 
was all they knew, and an abrupt 
reversal that negated their accustomed habits would create an 
impossible societal conflict. They 
were reoriented after the Fourth 
War, and succeeding generations 
adjusted to normal living without 
difficulty." 

A sound from overhead made 
them look up. Gibson was standing in the Marco's open port. 

"Conference," Gibson said in 
his heavy baritone, and went 
back inside. 

HPHEY followed Gibson quickly 
and without question, more 
disturbed by the terse order than 
by the killing in the grass flats. 
Knowing Gibson, they realized 
that he would not have wasted 
even that one word unless emergency justified it. 

They found him waiting in the 
chart room with Xavier. For the 
thousandth time, seeing the two 
together, Farrell found himself 
comparing them: the robot, 
smoothly functional from flexible 
gray plastoid body to featureless 
oval faceplate, blandly efficient, 
totally incapable of emotion; 
Gibson, short and dark and competent, heavy-browed and humor

less. Except for initiative, Farrell 
thought, the two of them could 
have traded identities and no one 
would have been able to notice 
any difference. 

"Xav and I found our Ringwave trouble," Gibson said. "The 
f&nerator is functioning, but the 
warp isn't going out. Something 
here on Sadr III is neutralizing 
it:; 

They stared at him as if he 
had just told them the planet 
was flat. 

"But a Ringwave can't be 
stopped completely, once it 
is started,'* Stryker protested. 
"You'd have to dismantle it to 
shut it off, Gib!" 

"The warping field can be 
damped out, though," Gibson 
said. "Adjacent generators operating at different phase levels will 
heterodyne at a frequency representing the mean variance between levels. The resulting 
beat-phase will be too low to 
maintain either field, and one or 
the other, or both, will blank out. 
If you remember, all Terrandesigned power plants are set to 
the same phase for that reason." 

"But these natives can'r have 
a Ringwave plant I" Farrell 
argued. "There's only this one 
village on Sadr III, Gib, an insignificant little agrarian township! If they had the Ringwave, 
they'd be mechanized. They'd 
have vehicles, landing ports . . ." 



"The Hymenops had the Ringwave," Gibson interrupted. "And 
they left the dome down there, 
the first undamaged one we've 
found. Figure it out for yourselves." 

They digested the statement in 
silence. Stryker paled slowly, as 
if it needed time for apprehension 
to work its way through his fat 
bulk. Farrell's uneasiness, sourceless until now, grew to chill certainty. 

I think I've expected this, without realizing it. since my first 
flight," he said. "It stood to reason that the Hymenops would 
quit running somewhere, that 
we'd bump into them eventually 
out here on the fringes. Twenty 
thousand light-years back to 70 
Ophiuchi is a long way to retreat 
. . . Gib, do you think they're still 
here?" 

Gibson did not shrug, but his 
voice seemed to. "It won't matter 
one way or the other unless we 
can clear the Marco's generator." 

From another man it might 
have been irony. Knowing Gibson, Farrell and Stryker accepted 
it as a bald statement of fact. 

"Then we're up against a Hymenop hive-mind," Stryker said. 
"And we can't run away from it, 
Any suggestions?" 

"We'll have to find the interfering generator and stop it," Farrell offered, knowing that was the 



34 




 



only obvious solution. 

"One alternative," Gibson corrected. "If we can determine what 
phase-level the interfering warp 
uses, we may be able to adjust 
the Marco's generator to match 
it. Once they're in resonance, 
they won't interfere." He caught 
Stryker's unspoken question and 
answered it. "It would take a 
week. Maybe longer." 

Stryker vetoed the alternative. 
"Too long. If there are Hymcnops 
here, they won't give us that 
much time." 

Farrell switched on the chart 
room scanning screen and centered it on the village downslope. 
Scattered cottages with dark tiled 
roofs and lamp-bright windows 
showed up clearly. Out of their 
undisciplined grouping swept the 
great hemispherical curve of the 
dome, glinting dully metallic in 
the starshine. 

"Maybe we're jumping to conclusions," he said. "We've been 
here for five weeks without seeing 
a trace of Hymenops, and from 
what I've read of them, they'd 
have jumped us the minute we 
landed. Chances are that they 
left Sadr III in too great a hurry 
to wreck the dome, and their 
Ringwave power plant is still 
running." 

"You may be *ight," Stryker 
said, brightening. "They carried 
the fight to us from the first skirmish, two hundred years ago, and 



they damned near beat us before 
we learned how to fight them." 

He looked at Xavier's silent 
plastoid figure with something 
like affection. "We'd have lost 
that war without Xave's kind. 
We couldn't match wits with Hymenop hive-minds, any more 
than a swarm of grasshoppers 
could stand up to a colony of 
wasps. But we made mechanicals 
that could. Cybernetic brains and 
servo-crews, ships that thought 
for themselves . . ." 

He squinted at the visiscreen 
with its cryptic, star-streaked 
dome. "But they don't think as 
we do. They may have left a rear 
guard here, or they may have 
boobytrapped the dome." 

"One of us will have to find 
out which it is," Farrell said. He 
took a restless turn about the 
chart room, weighing the probabilities. "It seems to fall in my 
department." 

Stryker stared. "You? Why?" 

"Because I'm the only one who 
can go. Remember what Gib said 
about changing the Marco's 
Ringwave to resonate with the 
interfering generator? Gib can 
make the change; I can't. You're 

"Too old and fat," Stryker finished for him. "And too damned 
slow and garrulous. You're right, 
of course." 

They let it go at that and put 
Xavier on guard for the night. 



WAILING WALL 



3> 5: 



The mechanical was infinitely 
more alert and sensitive to approach than any of the crew, but 
the knowledge did not make Farrell's sleep the sounder. 

He dozed fitfully, waking a 
dozen times during the night to 
smoke cigarettes and to speculate 
fruitlessly on what he might find 
in the dome. He was sweating out 
a nightmare made hideous by 
monstrous bees that threatened 
him in buzzing alien voices when 
Xavicr's polite monotone woke 
him for breakfast. 

FARRELL was halfway down 
the grassy slope to the village 
when he realized that the Marco 
was still under watch. Approaching close enough for recognition, 
he saw that the sentry this time 
was Tarvil, the Sadrian who had 
first approached the ship. The 
native's glance took in FarrelFs 
shoulder-pack of testing tools and 
audiphone, brushed the handtorch and blast gun at the Terran's belt, and slid away without 
trace of expression. 

"I'm going into the dome," 
Farrell said. He tried to keep the 
uncertainty out of his voice, and 
felt a rasp of irritation when he 
failed. "Is there a taboo against 
that?" 

The native fell in beside him 
without speaking and they went 
down together, walking a careful 
ten feet apart, through dew


drenched grass flats that gleamed 
like fields of diamonds under the 
early morning sun. From the village, as they approached, straggled the inevitable exodus of 
adults and half-grown children, 
moving silently out to the fields. 

"Weird beggars," Farrell said 
into his audiphone button. "They 
don't even rub elbows at work. 
You'd think they were afraid of 
being contaminated." 

Stryker's voice came tinnily in 
his ear. "They won't seem so 
strange once we learn their motivations. I'm beginning to think 
this aloofness of theirs is a religious concomitant, Arthur, a 
hangover from slave -controls designed to prevent rebellion 
through isolation. Considering 
what they must have suffered 
under the Hymenops, it's a wonder they're even sane." 

"I'll grant the religious origin," 
Farrell said. "But I wouldn't risk 
a centicredit on their sanity. I 
think the lot of them arc nuts." 

The village was not deserted, 
but so far as Farrell's coming was 
concerned, it might as well have 
been. The few women and children he saw on the streets ignored him — and Tarvil — completely. 

He met with only one sign of 
interest, when a naked boy perhaps six years old stared curiously and asked something in a 
childish treble of the woman ac



 



companying him. The woman 
answered with a single sharp 
word and struck the child across 
the face, sending him sprawling. 

Farrell relayed the incident. 
"She said 'Quiet!' and slapped 
htm down, Lee. They start their 
training early." 

"Their sort of indifference 
couldn't be congenital," Stryker 
said. His tinny murmur took on 
a puzzled sound. "But they've 
been free for four generations. 
It's hard to believe that any 
forcibly implanted control mechanism could remain in effect so 
long." 

A shadow blocked the sun, 
bringing a faint chill to Farrell 
when he looked up to see the 
great rounded hump of the dome 
looming over him. 

"I'm going into the dome now," 
he said. "It's like all the others 
—no openings except at ground 
level, where it's riddled with 
thriu." 

Tarvil did not accompany him 
inside. Farrell. looking back as 
he thumbed his hand-torch alight 
in the nearest entranceway, saw 
the native squatting on his heels 
and looking after him without a 
single trace of interest. 

"T'M at ground level." Farrell 
■■■ said later, "in what seems to 
have been a storage section. 
Empty now, with dust everywhere except in the corridors the 



natives use when they come in, 
mornings. No sign of Hymenops 
yet." 

Stryker's voice turned worried. 
"Look sharp for traps, Arthur. 
The place may be mined." 

The upper part of the dome, 
Farrell knew from previous experience, would have been given 
over in years past to Hymenop 
occupation, layer after rising 
layer of dormitories tiered like 
honeycombs to conserve space. 
He followed a spiral ramp downward to the level immediately 
below surface, and felt his first 
excitement" of discovery when he 
found himself in the audience 
chambers that, until the Marco's 
eoming, had been the daily goal 
of the Sadrian natives. 

The level was entirely taken 
up with bare ten-foot cubicles, 
each cramped chamber dominated by a cryptic metal-andcrystal likeness of the Hymenop 
head set into the metal wall opposite its corridor entrance. From 
either side of a circular speakinggrill, the antennae projected into 
the room, rasplikc and alert, 
above faceted crystal eyes that 
glowed faintly in the near-darkness. The craftsmanship was 
faultless, stylized after a fashion 
alien to Farrell's imagining and 
personifying with disturbing realism the soulless, arrogant efficiency of the Hymenop hivemind. To Farrell, there was about 



WAILING WALL 



3? 



each image a brooding air of 
hypnotic fixity. 

"Something new in Hymenop 
experiments," he reported to 
Stryker. "None of the other 
domes we found had anything 
like this. These things have some 
bearing on the condition of the 
natives, Lee — there's a path worn 
through the dust to every image, 
and I can see where the people 
knelt. I don't like it. I've got a 
hunch that whatever these 
damned idols were used for succeeded too well." 

"They can't be idols," Stryker 
said. "The Hymenops would have 
known how hard it is to displace 
anthropomorphism entirely from 
human worship. But I think 
you're right about the experiment's working too well. No ordinary compulsion would have 
stuck so long. Periodic hypnosis? 
Wait, Arthur, thaf s an angle I 
want to check with Gibson . . 

He was back a moment later, 
wheezing with excitement. 

"Gib thinks I'm on the right 
track — periodic hypnosis. The 
Hymenops must have assigned a 
particular chamber and image to 
each slave. The images are 
mechanicals, robot mesmerists designed to keep the natives' compulsion- to -isolation renewed. 
Post-hypnotic suggestion kept the 
poor devils coming back every 
morning, and their children with 
them, even after the Hymenops 



pulled out. They couldn't break 
away until the Marco's Ringwave 
forced a shutdown of the dome's 
power plant and deactivated the 
images. Not that they're any better off now that they're free; they 
don't know how — " 

Farrell never heard the rest of 
it. Something struck him sharply 
across the back of the head. 

WHEN he regained consciousness, he was naked and 
weaponless and lost. The rustling 
of approach, bodiless and dreadful in darkness, panicked him 
completely and sent him fleeing 
through a sweating eternity that 
brought him finally to the dome's 
lowest level and the Hymenop 
power plant. 

He went hesitantly toward the 
shadowy bulk of the Ringwave 
cylinder, drawn as much now by 
its familiarity as driven by the 
terror behind him. At the base 
of the towering machine, he made 
out a control board totally unrecognizable in design, studded 
with dials and switches clearly 
intended for alien handling. 

The tinny whispering of Stryker's voice in the vaultlike quiet 
struck him with the frightening 
feeling that he had gone mad. 

He Saw his equipment pack 
then, lying undamaged at the 
foot of the control board. Stryker's voice murmured from its 
audieom unit : "We're in the

dome, Arthur. Where are you? 
What level—" 

Farrell caught up the audicom, 
swept by a sudden wild lift of 
hope. "I'm at the bottom of the 
dome, in the Ringwave chamber. 
They took my gun and torch. 
For God's sake, hurry!" 

The darkness gave up a furtive 
scuffling of sandaled feet, the 
tight breathing of many men. 
Someone made a whimpering 
sound, doglike and piteous; a 
Sadiian voice hissed sharply, 
"Quiet!" 

Stryker's metallic whisper said : 
"We're tracking your carrier, Arthur. Use the tools they left you. 
They brought you there to repair 
the Ringwave, to give back the 
power that kept their* images 
going. Keep busy!" 

Farrell, only half understanding, took up his instrument case. 
His movement triggered a tense 
rustle in the darkness; the voice 
whimpered again, a tortured 
sound that rasped Farrell's nerves 
like a file on glass. 

"Give me back my Voice. I 
am alone and afraid. I must have 
Counsel . . 

Beneath the crying, Farrell felt 
the terror, incredibly voiced, that 
weighted the darkness, the horror 
implicit in stilled breathing, the 
swelling sense of outrage. 

There was a soft rush of bodies, 
a panting arid struggling. The 
whimpering stopped. 



The instrument case slipped 
out of Farrell's hands. On the 
heels of its nerve -shattering crash 
against the metal floor came 
Stryker's voice, stronger as it 
came closer. 

"Steady, Arthur. They'll kill 
you if you make a scene. We're 
coming, Gib and Xav and I. 
Don't lose your head!" 

Farrell crouched back against 
the cold curve of the Ringwave 
cylinder, straining against flight 
with an effort that left him trembling uncontrollably. A spasm of 
incipient screaming seized his 
throat and he bit it back savagely, stifling a terror that could 
not be seen, grasped, fought with. 

He was giving way slowly when 
X a v i e r ' s inflectionless voice 
droned out of the darkness : 
"Quiet. Your Counsel will be restored." 

There was a sudden flood of 
light, unbearable after long 
darkness. Farrell had a failing 
glimpse of Gibson, square face 
blocked with light and shadow 
from the actinic flare overhead, 
racing toward him through a silently dispersing throng of Sadrians. 

Then he passed out

in the chart room when he 
awoke. The Marco Four was already in space; on the visiscreen,

WAIUNG WALL 



crescent of Sadr III, and behind 
it. in the black pit of space, the 
fiery white eye of Deneb and the 
pyrotechnic glowing of Albireo's 
blue-and-yellow twins. 

"We're headed out," he said, 
^jewildered. "What happened?" 

Stryker came over and unstrapped him. Gibson, playing 
chess with Xavier across the 
chart-room plotting table, looked 
up briefly and went back to his 
gambit. 

"We reset the Ringwave in the 
dome to phase with ours and 
lugged you out," Stryker explained genially. He was back in 
character again, his fat paunch 
quivering with the beginning of 
laughter. "We're through here. 
The rest is up to Reorientation." 

Farrell gaped at him. "You're 
giving up on Sadr III?" 

"We've done all we can. Those 
Sadrians need something that a 
preliminary expedition like ours 
can't give them. Right now they 
are willing victims of a rigid religious code that makes it impossible for any one of them to 
express his wants, hopes, ideals or 
misfortunes to another. Exchanging confidences, to them, is the 
ultimate sacrilege." 

"Then they are crazy. They'd 
have to be, with no more opportunity for emotional catharsis 
than that!" 

"They're not insane, they're — 
adapted. Those robot images you 



found are everything to this culture: arbiters, commercial agents, 
monitors and confessors all in 
one. They not only relay physical 
needs from one native to another; 
they listen to all problems and 
give solutions. They're Counselors, remember ? Man's gregaripusness stems largely from his 
need to unload his troubles on 
someone else. The Hymenops 
came up with an efficient substitute here, and the natives accepted it as the norm." 

Farrell winced with sudden understanding. "No wonder the 
poor devils cracked up right and 
left. With their Ringwave dead, 
they might as well have been 
struck blind and dumb! They 
couldn't even get together among 
themselves to figure a way out." 

"There you have it," Stryker 
said. "They knew we were responsible for their catastrophe, 
but they couldn't bring themselves to ask us for help because 
we were human beings like themselves. So they went mad one by 
one and committed the ultimate 
blasphemy of shouting their misery in public, and their fellows 
had to kill them or countenance 
. sacrilege. But they'll quiet down 
now. They should be easy enough 
to handle by the time the Reorientation lads arrive." 

He began to chuckle. "We left 
their Counselors running, but we 
disconnected the hypnosis-re



 



newal circuits. They'll get only 
wh at they need from now on , 
which is an outlet for shifting 
their personal burdens. And with 
the post-hypnotic compulsion 
gone, they'll turn to closer association with each other. Human 
gregariousncss will reassert itself. 
After a couple of generations, the 
Reorientation boys can write 
them off as Terran Normal and 
move on to the next planetary 
madhouse we've dug up for 
them." 

Farrell said wonderingly, "I 
never thought of the need to exchange confidences as being so 
important. But it is; everyone 
does it. You and I often talk over 
personal concerns, and Gila — " 

He broke off to study the 
intent pair at the chessboard, 
comparing Gibson's calm self


sufficiency to the mechanical's 
bland competence, 

"There's an exception for your 
theory, Lee. Iron Man Gibson 
never gave out with a confidence 
in his life!" 

Stryker laughed. "You may be 
right. How about it. Gib? Do you 
ever feel the need of a wailing 
wall?" 

Gibson looked up briefly from 
his game, his square face unsurprised. 

"Well, sure. Why not? I tell 
my troubles to Xavier." 

When they looked at each 
otlier blankly, he added, with the 
nearest approach to humor that 
either Farrell or Stryker had ever 
seen in him: "It's a reciprocal arrangement. Xav confides his to 
me."

FORECAST 

Next month brings the conclusion of GRAVY PLANET by Frederik Pohl 
and C. M. Kornbluth. The first two installments were brilliant, but the last 
is incandescent with ideas and action! You'll hate to see it end, which seems 
to be characteristic of GALAXY serials. 

Being in love with anyone at all creates problems enough, but in YESTERDAY HOUSE, Fritz Leiber puts his protagonist through something really trying 
— falling in love with somebody who couldn't possibly exist! Not a ghost 
story at all, it's based on solid scientific fad. 

James Blish faces a desperate problem in SURFACE TENSION — mankind 
must adopt to a thoroughly hostile planet or die! There is a solution, of 
course ... a provocative, exciting one . . . and perhaps the weirdest space 
flight in all science fiction! 

All this plus short stories, Willy Ley's FOR YOUR INFORMATION and 
other features.

of Galactic Slang 

Since the beginnings of slang

way fe preserve them . . . invent 
them fongr before they happen.' 



Compiled by EDWARD WELLEN 

lllusiicried by DAVID HONE 

A\t1er: to delay asking a 
question until it becomes unan&werahle. 

O. T. SWIFEL (4217-4259 
Unified Era), a Terran 
physicist, remains the only being 
in the Galaxy believed ^o have 
journeyed into the past. On 203day, 4259, Swifel's assistants 
helped htm don the Emropical 
helmet he had devised. With this 
helmet he attuned himself to an 
artifact found in the ruins of 
Rome. Forthwith, Swifel was 



transported from his laboratory 
in New Zealand to a square in 
ancient Rome. 

A^^^laSo 

A ppare n t ly f Tightened by the 
apparition, a noonday crowd of 
toga-clad Romans hurriedly dispersed. One man alone stood his 
ground. 




 



Swifel, already beginning to 
suffer from the temporal stress 
that sapped his energy, staggered 
to the arch beside which the man 
stood. Fighting off waves of pain 
with all the power of his will, 
Swifel inquired in Latin; "What 
year is this?" 

The man, quite unperturbed, 
responded that it was 124 a.d. On 
the verge of blacking out, Swifel 
snapped himself back to his own 
era. 

But as he dictated the account 
of his brief excursion, there began 
the awesome physical transformation which seemingly characterizes travel into the past and 
which has militated against the 
desire to repeat Swifel's experiment. 

Drained of life -potential, Swifel's body stiffened into a petrified pillar. However, before 
complete immobilization set in, 
Swifel managed to voice this 
question: 

"How was he able to answer 
me in modern English?" 

F. E. *C; an expression of 
hostility from an unsuspected 
source. 

rwiHE letters F. E. G. signify 
For Emotional Gratification. 
The first F. E. G. was activated 
by the Venusian roboticist Kor 
Lio (2289-2370 U.E.). One day in 
2314, his son, aged four year3 



Terran, wandered into Kor's 
home workshop.. 

The usually mild technician 
was joyously delivering a savage 
kick to the posterior of his superior, the Chief Roboticist. 

Becoming aware of his child's 
presence, Kor colored a deeper 
peppermint and coiled his leg 
back in its normal position. He 
hastily informed his son that this 
Chief Roboticist was not the real 
one. It was the first experimental 
model of an F. E. G. 




The F. E. G., a roboticized 
replica of a hated individual, was 
to be a psychic safety valve, a 
harmless outlet for emotions repressed because of danger of reprisal. 

Kor explained that the use of 
the F. E. G. differed from that 
to which witch doctors once put 
wax dolls. Unlike the witch doctors' suggestible victims, the 
original would not know that his 
enemy was subjecting his image 
to indignities. 

Kor smiled at his son and wondered if the child understood.

His son smiled back. It was 
the warm, coaxing smile that always turned each of Kor's hearts 
over. "Please, Daddy," the child 
said, "make me one of you." 

Hickey's Mistake: an act with 
serious consequences, paradoxically the result of the very knowledge that such an act has such 
serious consequences. 

GEORGE Matthew Hickey 
(2743-2765 Unified Era) was 
a Terran archeologist. It was on 
a field trip to Planet 32B796 that 
he made the error which has perpetuated his name. 

Hickey seerns to have been 
quite inexperienced. Records indicate that he arrived with only 
six weeks' supplies, although he 
i ntended to st ay three month s. 
However, that was not Hickey's 
Mistake, for there was always the 
practical possibility of living off 
the land. Besides, as later events 
proved, Hickey required only two 
weeks' supplies. 

At that time, the natives of 
Planet 32B796 had a culture similar to that of Earth's Middle 
Paleolithic man. This fact caused 
Hickey's study of the daily life 
of the natives to be brief, inasmuch as the routine was a 
simple struggle for survival. Hickey soon turned his attention to 
uncovering a burial mound. 

That, however, was not Hick


ey's Mistake, for the natives 
permitted outsiders to intrude in 
exchange for some of the gaudier 
products of Galactic civilization. 

In the opened graves, Hickey 
found tools buried with the dead. 
(Middle Paleolithic man had also 
buried tools with the dead.) 
This excited Hickey — it apparently proved the existence of a rigid 
pattern of development for humanoid life. 

However, that was not Hickey's 
Mistake, although the subsequent 
work of Steiner has shattered 
that theory. 

Hickey's notes end here, but we 
may reconstruct what followed. 
Hickey used gestures to question 
the natives. He asked if they 
currently buried tools with their 
dead. They shook their heads. 
Yet the burials had been fairly 
recent. Hickey. therefore, rashly 
accused the natives of lying. 




That was not Hickey's Mistake, 
however, for the natives who had 
gathered about him took the accusation in good spirit. They 
found humor in the outsider's in


44 




 



ability to see what was so plain 
to them. They managed to explain to Hickey that they did not 
bury the tools with the dead. It 
was, indeed, the reverse. When 
someone accidentally broke or 
destroyed a tool, it was the tool 
they buried. Their custom was to 
entomb the tool-breaker with the 
tool. 

This revelation stirred Hickey 
deeply. So deeply that, in his 
eagerness to record it, he bore 
down too heavily on his pen and 
broke it. 

That was Hickey's Mistake. 

Hsilgne: a message which contains more information than the 
sender realizes, yet leas than the 
receiver requires. 

ON 23day, 2416 Unified Era, 
the robutler of Prof. Ian 
Heath (b. 2351) found his employer dead in the laboratory of 
the professor's London , Terra , 
home. The body lay beside a 
small pile of ashes and a large 
heap of battered machinery. Two 
objects had fallen from the professor's grasp — a vial of poison 
and a note. This is what the note 
says: 

"I am taking my own life. It is 
because the discovery that ought 
to have proved the prime achievement of my career has turned 
out to be my supreme failure. 
I am sorry that, in my first re


action, I destroyed the machine 
and my formulae. I should have 
allowed them to stand, to perpetuate Heath's Folly. 




"My purpose was to construct 
a device that would set up an 
implosion vortex. I believed that 
such an effect would twist matter 
out of the matrix of our universe 
and into a different form of existence. 

"Looking back, it seems foolish 
that I should have chosen to begin the experiment with myself 
as guinea pig. But I was eager 
to experience another state of 
being, however fleeting, and my 
formulae indicated a safety margin. 

"So I started the machine, set 
the implosion vortex for a duration of one-thousandth of a 
second Terran and stepped into 
its focus. I waited. Nothing happened. I felt no change, no sensation whatever. 

"I stepped out. My machine 
hummed most impressively. I had 
rechecked my formulae countless 
times. The only error, therefore, 
was my premise of an implosion 
vortex. 



ORIGINS OF GALACTIC SLANG

"And so I bid the Universe 
farewell. Perhaps I shall experience another state of being, after 
ell. Or is the belief only another 
Heath's Folly?" 

The above note is on exhibition 
at London Museum. It faces a 
mirror so visitors may read it 
more easily. 

Mutiny; to alter the perspective of past events. 

LABORIOUS research has 
traced this term back to the 
fust recorded empirical proof of 
the co-existence of space -time 
continua. 

On October 12, 1954, at approximately seven minutes past 
four P. m., there occurred the 
temporal and spatial displacement of the newsstand located at 
the northwest corner of 57 th 
Street and Madison Avenue in 
New York City, Terra. Manny 
Freeman, the proprietor and operator of the newsstand, being within the newsstand at the time, 
perforce accompanied it upon its 
journey. 

Extracts from a transcription 
of Manny's own words follow. 

"Whoosh! I feel myself gettin' 
dizzy. I hear a customer holler, 
'Hey, hold on! How about my 
change?" And then Fifty-seventh 
and Madison is gone and me and 
the stand is settin' in a kind of 
courtyard. I seen four or five big 



— what I mean, bigl — things. But 
it was like they was made outa 
smoke." 




A question, directed at himself, 
took shape in his head. "Why 
has your world spewed you 
hither?" 

Manny sensed that the question really emanated from one of 
the forms confronting him. 

"Look," Manny said, "I din ast 
to come here. All I know is, one 
minute I'm sellin' papers, next 
minute it's like I'm dreamin'. I 
gotta get back. Look, I just got 
in a pile of extras ..." 

He picked up a paper and 
showed them the headline. 

GIANTS MASSACRE YANKS 

Manny describes himself as 
becoming somewhat agitated. 

"Hey!" he said. "That's impossible! The Yanks was leadin' 
the Giants twelve to four at the 
end of the sixth. Then there was 
a lot of excitement and they 
called the game for some reason. 
A bunch of customers come over 
right then, so I din catch the 
reason." 



46 




 



Manny recalls that at this point 
he seemed to hear voices conversing in his brain: "He speaks 
truth." "This means that there 
is a temporal cancer which will 
spread unless we immediately restore maximum probability." 

That is all Manny can tell us 
of the parallel continuum. Again 
his senses reeled. 

At about seven and one-quarter 
minutes past four, the newsstand 
reappeared in its normal location 
and Manny gave the indignant 
customer his rightful change. 

And approximately one hour 
earlier, at Yankee Stadium, several gigantic forms suddenly materialized and loomed menacingly 
above the Yankee dugout. 

Titling a*i>ir to Terra: engaging in an unprofitable venture. 

THIS phrase derives from the 
circumstance that Prof. Argus 
Bentley (1961-1989). 1988 Nobel 
Prize winner in Chemistry, independently provided the solution 
to Terra's pressing food problem. 

On March 11, 1987. while ostensibly on a fishing cruise off Key 
West. Prof. Bentley surreptitiously jettisoned a weighted pared. 
On March 17. the British superliner Queen Alexandria logged a 
sluggish transatlantic crossing of 
22 hours 18 minutes. Investigation exonerated the Irish chief 
engineer. 



A multitude of evidence pointed to one staggering conclusion: the oceans were jelling into 
a firm, viscous mass. Further investigation verified that the land 
areas of Terra were surrounded 
by highly nutritious aspic. 

On March 25. Prof. Bentley 
dramatically revealed to the 
world that this historic transformation had been brought about 
by his genius and initiative. He 
revealed that he had set off a selfsustaining colloidal process, initially involving thermite, ocean 
pressure and a catalyst which he 
had discovered. 




On April 1. Prof, Bentley was 
appointed American member of 
the Aspic Trusteeship Commission of the United Nations. The 
ATC successfully engineered the 
diversion of rivers into mid -continental reservoirs, licensed aspic mining operations and supervised 
distribution of aspic. 

On June 16, 1989, Prof. Bentley 
was one of fourteen persons fatally injured in Le Havre when a 
bomb exploded during ceremonies 
honoring him.

The murderer, who whs never 
apprehended, was suspected of 
being a chef who objected to the 
manner in which France was garnishing its coastal aspic. 

Zaitling: embracing eagerly, 
but without feelings of ardent 
affection 

FEN Zaslin (3660-3772) was a 
Callistan biologist. In 3695, he 
married a beautiful young Martian. Despite his marked display 
of possessive jealousy, their relationship seems to have been a 
happy one the first four years. 

In 3699, Zaslin was drafted for 
a two-year tour of duty aboard a 
Solar Expeditionary Service vessel. Early in the morning of the 
day of departure, Zaslin's wife 
awoke suddenly, startled by a 
labial sensation. 

She discovered Zaslin in the 
act of applying a salve to her 
lips. 

With an admixture of embarrassment and defiance, he explained that he had developed a 
repellent that would make it 
impossible for her lips to meet 
those of another being. 

Zaslin's wife laughed affectionately at what she termed his 
lovable foolishness and attempted 
to brush his cheek with her lips. 
To her surprise, she found her 
lips curling back, away from his 
flesh. 



Good-naturedly, she substituted a fond farewell hug for a kiss. 

Zaslin departed, promising that 
upon his return he would coat 
his lips with a nullifying agent 
so mat he might, like the Prince 
Charming of the Terran myth, 
awaken his Sleeping Beauty with 
a kiss. 

Zaslin's wife was on hand when 
the SES vessel returned. Sighting 
his familiar figure descending the 
ramp, she eagerly jostled her way 
through the welcoming crowd and 
ran toward him. She clung to him 
and pressed her lips tightly to 
his. 




Finally she broke away and released a heartfelt sigh. 

Then she administered a resounding slap to Zaslin's face, 
automatically divorcing him, and 
rushed to the spaceport restaurant. 

There she ended two years of 
enforced vegetarianism by devouring a thick, juicy steak.

it assured him six or seven hundred would be a fair price. But 
when he got up-country, it hadn't 
turned out quite as simple as the 
Port Clarkers seemed to think. 

The first three Martian families 
he had tackled hadn't shown any 
disposition to part with their 
daughters at all. The next wanted 
$1500, and wouldn't budge. Leilie's parents had started at $1500, 
too, but they came down to $1000 
after he'd made it plain that he 
wasn't going to stand for extortion. 

On the way back to Port Clarke 
with her, when he came to work 
it out, he found himself not so 
badly pleased with the deal, after 
all. Over the five-year term of his 
appointment, it would cost him 
only $200 a year at the worst — 
that is to say, if he were not able 
to sell her for $400, maybe even 
$500, when he got back. Looked 
at that way, it wasn't really at 
all unreasonable. 

In town once more, he went to 
explain the situation and get 
things all set with the Company's 
agent. 

"Look," he said, "you know 
the way I'm fixed with this fiveyear contract as wayload station 
superintendent on Jupiter IV/II? 
Well, the ship that takes me 
there will be traveling light to 
pick up cargo. So how about 
another reservation on her?" He 
had already taken the precau


tionary step of finding out that 
the Company was accustomed to 
grant an extra passage in such 
circumstances, though not compelled to. 

The Company's agent was not 
surprised. After consulting some 
lists, he said that he saw no objection to an extra passenger. He 
explained that the Company was 
also prepared in such cases to 
supply the extra ration of food 
for one person at the nominal 
charge of $200 per annum, payable by deduction from salary. 

"What? A thousand bucks?" 
Duncan exclaimed. 

"Well worth it," said the agent. 
"It is nominal for the rations, 
because it's worth the Company's 
while to lay out the rest for something that helps to keep an employee from going nuts. That's 
pretty easy to do when you're 
fixed alone on a wayload station, 
they tell me — and I believe them. 
A thousand's not high if it helps 
you avoid a crackup." 

Duncan argued a bit, on principle, but the agent had the thing 
cut and dried. It meant that Lellie's price went up to $2000 — 
$400 a year. Still, with his own 
salary at $5000 a year, tax-free, 
unspendable during his term on 
Jupiter IV/II, and piling up 
nicely, it wouldn't come to such 
a big slice. So he agreed. 

"Fine," said the agent. "I'll 
fix it, then. All you'll need is an

embarkation permit for her,, and 
they'll grant that automatically 
on production of your marriage 
certificate." 

Duncan stared. '-'Marriage-certificate? Me marry a Mart?" The 
agent shook his head reprovingly. 
"No embarkation permit without 
it. Anti-slavery regulation. They'd 
think you meant to sell her— 
might even think you'd bought 
her." 

"What me?" Duncan said indignantly. 

"Even you," said the agent. "A 
marriage license will only cost 
you another ten dollars — unless 
you've got a wife back home, in 
which case it'll likely cost you a 
bit more later on." 

Duncan shook his head. "I've 
got no wife." 

"Uh-huh," said the agent, 
neither believing nor disbelieving. 
"Then what's the difference?" 

Duncan came back a couple of 
days later, with the certificate 
and the permit. The agent looked 
them over. 

"That's okay," he agreed. "I'll 
confirm the booking. My fee will 
be one hundred dollars." 

"Your fee?" 

"Call it safeguarding your investment," suggested the agent. 

The man who had issued the 
embarkation permit had required 
one hundred dollars, too. Duncan 
did not mention that now, but he 
said, with bitterness: "One dumb 



Mart's costing me plenty." 

"Dumb?" asked the agent, 
looking at him. 

"Speechless plus. These hick 
Marts don't know they're born." 

"H'm," said the agent. "Never 
lived here, have you?" 

"No, but I've laid-over here 
a few times." t 

The agent nodded. "They act 
dumb, and the way their faces 
are makes them look dumb. But 
they were a mighty clever people, 
once." 

"Once could be a long time 
ago." 

"Long before we got here, 
they'd given up bothering to 
think a lot. Their planet was 
dying and they were kind of content to die with it." 

"Well, I call that dumb. Aren't 
all planets dying, anyway?" 

"Ever see an old man just sitting in the Sun, taking it easy? 
It doesn't have to mean he's senile. It may, sure, but very likely 
he can snap out of it, and put his 
mind to work again if it really 
becomes necessary. But mostly 
he finds it not worth the bother. 
Less trouble just to let things 
happen." 

"Well, this one's only about 
twenty — say ten and a half of 
your Martian years — and she certainly lets 'em happen. And I'd 
say it's a kind of acid test for 
dumbness when a girl doesn't 
know what goes on at her own

wedding ceremony.** 

And then, on top of that, it 
turned out'to be necessary to lay 
out yet another hundred, dollars 
on clothing and other things for 
her, bringing the whole investment up to $2310. It was a sum 
which might possibly have been 
justified on 'a really smart girl, 
though on Lellie . . . 

But there it was. Once you 
made the first payment, you 
either lost on it, or were stuck for 
the rest. And, anyway, on a lonely wayload station, even she 
would be company — of a sort. 

THE First Officer called Duncan into the navigating room 
to take a look at his future home. 

"There it is," he said, waving 
his hand at a little world shown 
on the watch-screen. 

Duncan looked at the jaggedsurfaced crescent. There was no 
scale to it. It could have been 
the size of Luna or of a basketball. Whatever size the place 
proved to be, it was still just a 
lump of rock, turning slowly over. 
"How big?" he asked. 
Around forty miles mean 
diameter." 

"What'd that be in gravity?'* 
"Haven't worked it out. Call it 
slight, figure there isn't any, and 
you'll be near enough." 
"Uh-huh,** said Duncan, 
On the way back to the messroom, he paused to put his head 



into the cabin. Lellie was lying 
on her bunk, with the springcover fastened over her to give 
some illusion of weight. At the 
sight of him she raised herself 
on one elbow. 

She was small, not much over 
five foot. Her face and hands 
were delicate ; they had a fragility 
which was not simply a matter of 
frail bone-structure. To an Earthman, her eyes looked unnaturally 
round, seeming to give her a permanent expression of innocence 
surprised. The lobes of her ears 
hung unusually low out of a 
mass of brown hair that glinted 
with red among its waves. The 
paleness of her skin was emphasized by the color on her cheeks 
and the vivid red on her lips. 

"Hey," said Duncan, "you can 
start packing up the stuff now." 

"Packing up?" she repeated 
doubtfully, in a curiously resonant voice. 

"Sure, pack," Duncan told her. 
He demonstrated by opening a 
box, cramming some clothes into 
it, and waving a hand to include 
the rest. Her expression did not 
change, but the idea got across,, 

"We are come?" she asked. 

"We are nearly come, so get 
busy on this lot." 

"Yith — okay," she said, and 
began to unhook the cover. 

Duncan shut the door, and 
gave a shove which sent him 
floating down the passage lead


n 




 



ing to the general mess and living room. 

Inside the cabin, Lellie pushed 
away the cover. She reached 
down cautiously for a pair of 
metal soles, and attached them to 
her slippers by their clips. Still 
cautiously holding on to the 
bunk, she swung her feet over the 
side and lowered them until 
the magnetic soles clicked into 
contact with the floor. She stood 
up more confidently. 

The blown overall suit she 
wore revealed proportions that 
might be admired among Martians, but, by Earth standards, 
they were not classic. Because of 
the thinner air of Mars, her chest 
was big. But only her chest. That, 
of course, was to accommodate 
her greater lung capacity. The 
rest of her was almost childishly 
slender. 

Still ill at ease with weightlessness, she slid her feet to keep 
magnetic contact with the metal 
floor as she crossed the room. For 
some moments she paused in 
front of a wall mirror, contemplating her reflection. Then she 
turned away and began packing. 

"f~WNE hell of a place to take 
a woman to," Wishart, the 
ship's cook, was saying as Duncan came in. 

Duncan did not care a lot for 
Wishart, chiefly because, when it 
had occurred to him that Lellie 



ought to have some lessons m 
weightless cooking, Wishart had 
refused to give the tuition for lesa 
than fifty dollars, and thus increased the investment cost to 
$2360. Nevertheless, it was not 
Duncan's way to pretend to have 
misheard. 

"One hell of a place to be given 
a job," he amended grimly. 

No one replied to that. They 
knew how men came to be offered 
wayload jobs. 

It was not necessary, as the 
Company frequently pointed out, 
for superannuation at the age of 
forty to come as a hardship to 
anyone. Salaries were good, and 
the Company could cite plenty 
of cases where men had founded' 
brilliant subsequent careers on 
the savings of their space-service 
days. That was all right for the 
men who had not been obsessively interested in the fact that one 
four-legged animal can run faster 
than another. But this was not 
even an enterprising way to have 
lost one's money, so when it came 
to Duncan's time to leave crew 
work, they made him no more 
than the routine offer. 

H» had never been to Jupiter 
IV/II, but he knew just what it 
would be like — it was the second 
moon of Callisto, which was the 
fourth moon, in order of discovery, of Jupiter, and would inevitably be one of the grimmer kinds 
of cosmic pebble.

The Company had offered no 
alternative, so he signed up at 
the usual terms: $5000 a year for 
five years, and board and lodging, plus five months waiting time 
on half-pay before he could get 
there, plus six months afterward, 
also on half-pay. during "readjustment to gravity." 

It meant the next six years 
taken care of; five of them entirely without expenses, and a 
nice little sum at the end. 

The problem was: could you 
get through five years of isolation 
without cracking up? Even when 
the psychologists had okayed 
you, you couldn't be sure. Some 
could: others went to pieces in 
a few months and had to be 
taken off, gibbering. If you got 
through two years, they said, 
you'd be okay for five. But the 
only way to find out was to try. 

"What about my putting in the 
waiting time on Mars? I could 
live cheaper there," Duncan had 
suggested. 

They had consulted planetary 
tables and ship schedules, and 
discovered that it would be 
cheaper for them. too. They had 
declined to split the difference on 
the saving thus made, but they 
had booked him a passage for the 
following week, and arranged for 
him to draw, on credit, from the 
Company's agent there. 

The Martian colony in and 
around Port Clarke was rich in 



ex -spacemen who found it more 
comfortable to spend their rearguard years in the lesser gravity, 
broader morality, and greater 
economy there. They were great 
advisers. Duncan listened, but 
discarded most of it. Such methods of occupying oneself as learning the Bible or the works of 
Shakespeare by heart, or copying 
out three pages of the Encyclopaedia every day, or building 
model spaceships in botttes, struck 
him not only as tedious, but 
probably would drive him insane 
more quickly. The only one with 
sound practical advantages, in 
his opinion, had led him to picking Lellie to share his exile, and 
he still thought it was a sound 
one, in spite of its costing $2360. 

'He was well enough aware of 
the general opinion about it to 
refrain from adding a sharp retort to Wtshart. Instead, he conceded: "Maybe nobody ought to 
take a real woman to a place 
like that. But a Mart's different." 

"Even a Mart — *' Wishart began, but he was cut short by finding himself drift across the room 
as the arrestor tubes began to 
fire. 

Conversation ceased as everybody turned to on securing all 
loose objects. 

JUPITER IV/II was, by dofini«J tion. a sub-moon, probably a 
captured asteroid. The surface 



14 




 



was not cratered, like Luna's; it 
was simply a waste of jagged, 
riven rocks. The satellite as a 
whole had the form of an irregular ovoid, a bleak, cheerless 
lump of stone splintered off some 
vanished planet, with nothing 
whatever to commend it but its 
situation. 

There had to be wayload stations, for it would be hopelessly 
uneconomic to build big ships 
capable of landing on the major 
planets. A few of the older and 
smaller ships had actually been 
built on Earth, and so had to be 
launched from there, but the very 
first large, Moon -assembled ship 
established a new practice. Ships 
became truly spaceships and 
were no longer built to stand the 
strains of high gravitational pull. 
They began to make their voyages, carrying fuel, stores, freight, 
and changes of personnel, exclusively between satellites. The 
newer types did not put in even 
at Luna, but used the artificial 
satellite, Pseudos, exclusively as 
their Earth terminal. 

Freight between the wayload 
stations and their primaries was 
customarily consigned in powered 
cylinders known as crates; passengers were ferried back and 
forth in small rocket ships. Stations such as Pseudos, or Deimos, 
the main wayload for Mars, handled enough work to keep a crew 
busy, but in the outlying, little 



developed posts one man who was 
part handler, part watchman was 
enough. Ships visited them infrequently. On Jupiter IV/II one 
might, according to Duncan's information, expect an average of 
one every eight or nine Earth 
months. 

The ship continued to brake* 
coming in on a spiral, adjusting 
her speed to that of the satellite. 
The gyros started up to give stability. The small, jagged world 
grew until it overflowed the 
watch - screens. The ship was 
maneuvered into a close orbit. 
Miles of featureless, formidable 
rocks slid monotonously beneath 
her. 

The station site came onto the 
screen from the left — a roughly 
leveled area of a few acres, the 
first and only sign of order in the 
stony chaos. At the far end was 
a pair of hemispherical huts, one 
much larger than the other. At 
the near end, a few cylindrical 
crates were lined up beside a 
launching ramp hewn from the 
rock. Down each side of the area 
stood rows of canvas bins, some 
stuffed full to a conical shape, 
others slack, partly or entirely 
empty. A huge parabolic mirror 
was perched on a crag behind the 
station, looking like a monstrous, 
formalized flower. 

In the whole scene, there was 
only one sign of movement — a 
small space-suited figure pranc


DUM1 MARTI Art 



ing madly about on a metal apron 
in front of the larger dome, waving its arms in a wild welcome. 

Duncan left the screen and 
went to the cabin. He found Lellie fighting off a large case which, 
under the influence of deceleration, seemed determined to pin 
her against the wall. He shoved 
the case aside and pulled her out. 

"We're there," he told her. "Put 
on your spacesuit." 

Her round eyes ceased watching the case and turned toward 
him. There was no telling from 
them how she felt, what she 
thought. She said, simply: 

"Thpacethuit. Yith — okay." 

STANDING in the airlock of 
the dome, the outgoing superintendent paid more attention to 
Lellie than to the pressure dial. 
He knew from experience exactly 
how long equalizing took, and 
opened his faceplate without even 
a glance at the pointer. 

"Wish I'd had the sense to 
bring one," he observed. "Could 
have been mighty useful on the 
chores, too." 

He opened the inner door, and 
led through. 

"Here it is — and welcome to 
it." he said. 

The main living room was oddly shaped by reason of the dome's 
architecture, but it was spacious. 
It was also exceedingly, sordidly 
untidy. 



"Meant to clean up. never got 
around to it," he added. He 
looked at Lellie. There was no 
visible sign of what she thought 
of the place. "Never can tell with 
Marts," he said uneasily. "They 
kind of non -register." 

Duncan agreed: "I figured this 
one was astonished at being born, 
and never got over it." 

The other man went on looking at Lellie. His eyes strayed 
from her to a gallery of pinnedup terrestrial beauties, and back 
again. 

"Sort of funny shape Marts 
have." he said, musingly. 

"This one's considered a good 
enough looker where she comes 
from," Duncan told him. a trifle 
shortly. 

"Sure. No offense, bud. I guess 
they'll all seem a funny shape to 
me after this spell." He changed 
the subject. "I'd better show you 
the ropes around here." 

Duncan signed to Lellie to 
open her faceplate so she could 
hear him, and then told her to 
get out of her suit. 

The dome was the usual type: 
double - floored, double - walled, 
with an insulated and evacuated 
space between the two, constructed as a unit and held down 
by metal bars let into the rock. 
In the living quarters there were 
three more sizable rooms, able 
to cope with increased personnel 
if trade should expand.

**The rest," the outgoing man 
explained, "is the regular station 
stores, mostly food, air-cylinders, 
spares of one kind and another, 
and water. I guess you'll have 
to watch her on water ; most 
women seem to think it grows 
naturally in pipes." 

Duncan shook his head. "Not 
Marts. Living in deserts gives 'em 
• natural respect for water." 

The other picked up a clip of 
■tore -sheets. 

"We'll check and sign these 
later. It's a nice soft job here. 
The only freight now is rare metalliferous earths. Callisto hasn't 
been opened up a lot yet. Handling's easy. They tell you when 
a crate's on the way; you switch 
on the radio beacon to bring it in. 
On dispatch, you can't go wrong 
if you follow the tables." 

He looked around the .room. 
•"All home comforts. You like to 
read? Plenty of books." He waved 
a hand at the packed rows which 
covered half the inner partition 
wall. 

Duncan said he'd never been 
much of a reader. 

"Well, it helps," said the other. 
"Find pretty well anything that's 
known somewhere in that lot. 
Records there. Fond of music?" 

Duncan said he liked a good 
tune. 

"Better try the other stuff — 
tunes get to squirreling inside 
your head. Play chess?" He 



pointed to a board, with the men 
pegged into it. 

Duncan shook his head. 

"Pity. There's a fellow over on 
Callisto who plays a pretty hot 
game. He'll be disappointed not 
to finish this one. Still, if 1 was 
fixed up the way you are, maybe 
I wouldn't have been interested 
in chess myself." His eyes strayed 
to Lellie again. "What do you 
think she's going to do here, besides doing the cooking and 
amusing you?" 

It was not a question that had 
occurred to Duncan. He shrugged. 
"She'll be okay, I guess. There's 
a natural dumbness about Marts 
— they'll sit for hours on end. doing nothing at all. It's a gift they 
got." 

"Well, it certainly should come 
in handy here," said the other. 

THE regular ship's-call work 
went on. Cases were unloaded, 
the metalliferous earth hosed from 
the bins into the holds. A small 
ferry rocket came up from Callisto carrying a couple of timeexpired prospectors, and left 
again with their two replacements. The ship's engineers 
checked over the station's machinery, made renewals, topped 
up the water tanks, charged the 
spent air-cylinders, tested, tinkered, and tested again before giving their final okay. 

Duncan stood outside on the 




 



metal apron where, not long ago, 
his predecessor had performed 
his fantastic dance of welcome, 
to watch the ship take off. She 
rose straight up, with her under 
jets pushing her gently. The curve 
of her hull became an elongated 
crescent shining against the black 
sky. The main driving jets started 
to gush white flame edged with 
pink. Quickly she picked up 
speed. Before long she had dwindled to a speck which sank behind 
the ragged skyline. 

Quite suddenly Duncan felt as 
if he, too, had dwindled. He had 
become a speck upon a barren 
mass of rock which was itself a 
speck in the immensity. The indifferent sky about him had no 
scale. It was an utterly black void 
wherein suns flared perpetually, 
without reason or purpose. 

The rocks of the satellite, rising 
up in their harsh crests and 
ridges, were without scale, too. 
He could not tell which were 
near and which were far away: 
he could not, in the jumble of 
hard-lit planes and inky shadows, even make out their true 
form. There was nothing like 
them to be seen on Earth or Mars. 
Their unweathered edges were 
sharp as blades; they had been 
just as sharp as that for millions, 
upon millions of years, and would 
be for as long as the satellite 
existed. 

The unchanging eons seemed 



to stretch out before and behind 
him. All life was a speck, a briefly 
transitory accident, utterly unimportant to the universe, a queer 
little note dancing for a short 
moment in the light of the eternal 
suns. Reality was just globes of 
fire and balls of stone senselessly 
rolling along through emptiness, 
through time unimaginable. 

Within his heated suit, Duncan 
shivered 'a little. Never before 
had he been so alone, never so 
much aware of the vast, callous, 
futile loneliness of space. Looking 
out into the blackness, with light 
that had left a star a million 
years ago shining into his eyes, 
he wondered: "What the heck's 
it all about, anyway?" 

The sound of his own unanswerable question broke up the 
mood. He shook his head to clear 
it of speculative nonsense. He 
turned his back on the Universe, 
reducing it again to its proper 
status as a background for life 
in general and human life in particular, and stepped into the airlock. 

AS his predecessor had told 
him, the job was soft. Duncan 
made his radio contacts with Callisto at pre-arranged times. Usually it was little more than a 
formal check on one another's 
continued existence, with perhaps 
an exchange of comment on the 
radio news. Only occasionally did 



DUMB MARTIAN 



they announce a dispatch and 
tell him when to switch on his 
beacon. Then, in due course, the 
cylinder crete would make its appearance and float slowly down. 
It was quite a simple matter to 
couple it up to a bin to transfer 
the load. 

The satellite's day was too 
short for convenience, and its 
night, lit by Callisto, and sometimes by Jupiter as well, was 
almost as bright; so they disregarded it and lived by the calendar clock which kept Earth time 
on the Greenwich Meridian setting. At first, much of the time 
had been occupied in ^disposing of 
the freight that the ship had left. 
Some of it went into the main 
dome — necessities for themselves, 
and other items that would store 
better where there was warmth 
and air, some into the small, airless, unheated dome. The greater 
part was stowed and padded carefully into cylinders and launched 
off to the Callisto base. But once 
that work had been cleared, the 
job was certainly soft, too 
soft . . . 

Duncan drew up a program. At 
regular intervals he would inspect 
this and that, he would leap almost weightlessly up to the crag, 
check on the Sun motor there, 
and so forth. But keeping to an 
unnecessary program requires 
resolution. 

Sun motors, for instance, were 



built to run for a long time without attention. The only action 
one could take if theirs stopped 
would be to call Callisto for a 
ferry rocket to come and take 
Lellie and himself off until a ship 
arrived to repair it. A breakdown 
there, the Company had explained 
very clearly, was the only thing 
that would justify him in leaving 
his station, with the stores of precious earths, unmanned (and it 
was also indicated that to contrive a breakdown for the sake 
of a change was unlikely to prove 
worthwhile). 

One way and another, the program did not last very long. 

There were times when Duncan 
found himself wondering whether 
bringing Lellie had been such a 
good idea, after all. On the purely practical side, he would not 
have cooked as well as she did, 
and probably have pigged it quite 
as badly as his predecessor had, 
but if she had not been there, the 
necessity of looking after himself 
would have given him something 
to do. And even from the standpoint of company — well, she was 
that, of a sort, but she was alien, 
queer; kind of like a half -robot, 
and dumb at that; certainly no 
fun. 

There were times — increasingly 
frequent times — when the very 
look of her irritated him intensely. So did the way she moved, 
and her gestures, and her silly 



40 




 



pidgin-talk when she talked, and 
her self-contained silence when 
she didn't, and her remoteness, 
and all her differentness, and the 
fact that he would have been 
$2360 better off without her. 

Nor did she make a serious attempt to remedy her shortcomings, even where she had the 
means. Her face, for instance. 
You'd think any girl would try to 
make her best of that — but did 
she? There -was that left eyebrow 
again; it made her look like a 
drunken clown, but a lot she 
cared . . . 

"For heaven's sake," he told 
her once more, "put the cockeyed 
thing straight. Don't you know 
how to fix 'em yet? And you've 
got your color on wrong, too. 
Look at that picture — now look at 
yourself in the mirror: a smear 
of red all in the wrong place. And 
your hair, too, getting like seaweed again. You've got the things 
to wave it, so stop looking like a 
damned mermaid. I know you 
can't help being a dumb Mart, 
but you can at least try to look 
like a real woman," 

Lellie studied the colored picture, and then compared her reflection with it, critically. 

"Yith — okay," she said with 
compliant . detachment. 

Duncan snorted. "And that's 
another thing. It's not 'yith,' it's 
*yes.' Y-E-S, yes. Say 'yes.' " 

"Yith," said Lellie, obligingly. 



**Oh, for — Can't you ftear the 
difference? S-s-s, not th-th-th. 
Ye-sss." 

"Yith," she said. 

"No. Put your tongue further 
back like this — " 

The lesson went on for some 
time. Finally he grew angry. 

"Just making a monkey out of 
me, huh? You'd better be careful! Now, say 'y es -' *' 

She hesitated, looking at his 
wrathful face. 

"Go on, say it P* 

"Y-yeth," she tried, nervously. 

His hand slapped across her 
face harder than he had intended. 
The jolt broke her magnetic contact with the floor and sent her 
sailing across the room in a spin 
of arms and legs. She struck the 
opposite wall and rebounded, to 
float helplessly, out of reach of 
any hold. He strode after her, 
turned her right way up, and set 
her on her feet. His left hand 
clutched her overall in a bunch, 
just below her throat, his right 
fist raised. 

** Again!" he told her. 

Her eyes looked helplessly this 
way and that. He shook her. She 
tried. At the sixth attempt she 
managed: "Yeths." 

He accepted that for the time 
being. 

"You can do it, you see, when 
you try! Well, you're damn well 
going to try!" 

He let her go. She tottered 



DUMB MARTIAN 



M 



across the room, holding her 
hands to her bruised face. 

A number of times, while the 
weeks stretched so slowly into 
months, Duncan found himself 
wondering whether he was going 
to hold out. He lingered over 
what work there was as long as 
he could, but it left still too much 
time hanging on his hands. 

A middle-aged man who had 
read nothing longer than an occasional magazine article, Duncan 
did not take to books. He tired 
very quickly of the popular records, as his predecessor had 
prophesied, and could make nothing of the others. He taught himself the moves in chess from a 
book, and instructed Lellie in 
them, intending after a little 
practice with her to challenge the 
man on Callisto. Lellie, however, 
managed to win so consistently 
that he suspected he did not have 
the right kind of mind for the 
game. Instead, he taught her a 
kind of double- solitaire, but that 
didn't last long, either — the cards 
always seemed to run for Lellie. 

Occasionally, some news and 
entertainment were to be had 
from the radio. But with Earth 
somewhere around the other side 
of the Sun just then, Mars 
screened off half the time by Callisto, and the rotation of the satellite itself, reception was either 
impossible or badly distorted. 



So mostly he sat and fretted, 
hating the satellite, angry with 
himself, and irritated by Lellie. 

Just the phlegmatic way she 
went on with her tasks infuriated 
him. It seemed unfair that she 
could take it all better than he 
could simply because she was a 
dumb Mart. When his ill-temper 
became vocal, the look of her as 
she listened exasperated him still 
more. 

"For God's sake," he told her 
one time, "can't you make that 
silly face of yours mean something? Can't you laugh, or cry, or 
get mad — anything? It's enough 
to drive a guy nuts, looking at a 
face like a doll that just heard 
its first dirty story. I know you 
can't help being dumb, but get 
some expression into it." 

She went on looking at him 
without a shadow of a change. 

"Go on, you heard me! Smile, 
damn you! Smile!" 

Her mouth twitched very 
slightly. 

"Call that a smile? Now, there's 
a smile!" He pointed to a pin-up 
with a, smile like a piano keyboard. "Like that! Like this!" He 
grinned widely. 

"No," she said. "My face cannot wriggle like Earth faces." 

"Wriggle?" he repeated incensed. "Wriggle, you call it?" 
He freed himself from the chair's 
spring- cover and came toward 
her. She backed away until she 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTIOM 



was pressed against the wall. "I'll 
make yours wriggle. Go on, now 
—smile !" 

He lifted his fist. 

Lellie put her hands up to her 
face. 

"No!" she protested. "No — no 
— no!" 

TT was on the day Duncan 
marked off the eighth completed month that Callisto relayed news of a ship on the way. 
A couple of days later, he was 
able to make contact with her 
himself and confirm her arrival 
in about a week. 

He felt as if he had been given 
several stiff drinks. There were 
preparations to make, stores to 
check, deficiencies to note, a 
string of nil-nil-nil entries to be 
made in the log to bring it up to 
date. 

He bustled around as he got 
on with the job. He hummed to 
himself while he worked, and 
even ceased to be annoyed with 
Lellie. The effect of the news 
upon her was imperceptible — but, 
then, what else could you expect? 

Sharp on her estimated time, 
the ship hung above them, growing slowly larger as her upper 
jets pressed her down. The moment she was berthed, Duncan 
went aboard, with the feeling that 
everyone in sight was an old 
friend. 

The captain received him 



warmly and brought out the 
drinks. It was all routine — even 
Duncan's babbling and slightly 
inebriated manner was regular 
procedure in the circumstances. 
The only departure from pattern 
came when the captain introduced a man beside him. 

"We've brought a surprise for 
you, Superintendent. This is Doctor Whint. He'll be sharing your 
exile for a bit." 

Duncan shook hands with the 
man. "Doctor?" he said, surprised. 

"Not medicine — science," Alan 
Whint told him. "The Company's 
pushed me out here to do a geological survey — never can tell 
when you'll strike something important. I'll be here about a year. 
Hope you don't mind." 

Duncan said conventionally 
that he'd be glad to have some 
company. Later, he took Whint 
over to the dome. The geologist 
was surprised to find Lellie there; 
clearly, nobody had told him 
about her. He interrupted Duncan's explanations of the surroundings to say: 

"Won't you introduce me to 
your wife?" 

Duncan did so, without grace. 
He resented the reproving tone in 
Whint's voice; nor did he care for 
the way the geologist greeted Lellie just as if she were an Earthwoman. He was also aware that 
Whint had noticed the bruise on 



DUMB MARTIAN 




her cheek, which her makeup did 
not altogether cover. 

In his mind, he classified Alan 
Whint as one of the smooth, 
snooty type, and hoped that there 
was not going to be trouble with 
him. 

On the other hand, he reflected, 
trouble was better than boredom. 

IT was a matter of opinion who 
made the trouble when it 
boiled up some three months 
later. There had already been 
several occasions when it had 
lurked uneasily near. Very likely 
it would have come into the open 
long before, had Whint's work 



not taken him out of the dome 
so much. The moment of touchoff came when Lellie lifted her 
eyes from the book she was reading to ask: 

"What does 'female emancipation* mean?" 

Alan started to explain. He was 
only halfway through the first 
sentence when Duncan broke in: 

"Listen, pal, who told you to 
go putting ideas into her head?" 

Alan shrugged his shoulders 
slightly. "Why shouldn't she have 
ideas? Why shouldn't anyone?" 

"You know what I mean." 

"I never understand you guys 
who apparently can't say what 



44 



• ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you mean. Try again.** 

"All right, then. Right from the 
start, you began shoving your 
nose into things that aren't your 
business. Treating her, for instance, as if she was some classy 
dame back home." 

"I'm glad you noticed it." 

"And you think I didn't see 
why?" 

"I'm quite sure you didn't. You 
think, in your simple way, that 
I'm out to get your girl, and you 
resent that with all the weight of 
$2360. But you're wrong; I'm 
not." 

"My lvi'/e," he corrected. "She 
may be only a dumb Mart, but 



she's legally my wife and what I 
say goes." 

"Yes, Lellte is a Mart, as you 
call it. She may even be your 
wife, for all I know to the contrary. But dumb, she certainly is 
not. For one example, look at the 
speed with which she's learned 
to read — once someone took the 
trouble to show her how. I don't 
think you'd show up any too 
bright yourself in a language 
where you only knew a few words, 
and which you couldn't read." 

"It was none of your business 
to teach her. She didn't need to 
read. She was all right the v-ay 
she was. And why? So you'll get 



DUMB MARTIAN 



her thinking you're a better man 
than I am." 

"I talk to her the way I'd 
talk to any woman anywhereonly more simply, since she hasn't 
had the chance of an education. 
If she does think I'm a better 
man, then I agree with her. I'd 
be sorry if I couldn't." 

"I'll show you who's the better 
man — " Duncan began savagely. 

"You don't need to. I knew 
when I came here that you'd be 
a waster or you wouldn't be on 
this job— and it didn't take long 
for me to find out that you were 
a lousy bully, too. Do you suppose I haven't noticed the bruises? 
Do you think I've enjoyed having to listen to you bawling out a 
girl whom you've deliberately 
kept ignorant and defenseless 
when she has potentially ten 
times the sense you have? Having 
to watch a clod like you lording 
it over your 'dumb Mart'? You 
emetic!" 

In the heat of the moment, 
Duncan could not remember 
what an emetic was. Trying to 
remember gave him a chance to 
realize that he was older, less 
agile, not as fit as the geologist 
. . . that he'd probably get hurt 
more than he could hurt. Besides, 
Lellie was his wife. What was he 
getting so angry about? 

Both of them simmered, but 
nothing happened. Somehow the 
occasion was patched up and 



smoothed over. 

Alan continued to make his 
expeditions in the small craft 
which he had brought with him. 
He examined and explored other 
parts of the satellite, returning 
with specimen pieces of rock 
which he tested and arranged, 
carefully labeled, in cases. In his 
spare time he occupied himself, 
as before, with teaching Lellie. 

That he did it largely for his 
own occupation, as well as from 
a feeling that it should be done, 
Duncan did not altogether deny. 
But he was equally sure that, in 
continued close association, one 
thing leads to another, sooner or 
later. 

So far, there had been nothing 
between them that he could complain about — but Alan's term 
still had some nine months to go, 
even if he were relieved in time. 
Lellie was already hero-worshipping. And he was spoiling her 
more every day by this fool business of treating her as if she were 
an Earthwoman. One day they'd 
come alive to it — and then they 
would see him as an obstacle that 
would have to be removed. Prevention being better than cure, 
the sensible course was to see that 
the situation should never develop. There need not be any fuss 
about it . . . 

There was not. 

One day Alan Whint took off 
on a routine flight to prospect 




 



somewhere on the other side of 
the satellite. He never came back. 
That was all. 

rwiHERE was no telling what 
Lellie thought about it, but 
something seemed to happen to 
her. 

For several days, she spent almost all her time standing by the 
main window of the living room, 
looking out into the blackness at 
the flaring pinpoints of light. It 
was not that she was waiting or 
hoping for Alan's return — she 
knew as well as Duncan himself 
that, when thirty-six hours had 
gone by, there was no chance of 
that. She said nothing. Her expression maintained its unchanged 
exasperating look of slight surprise. Only in her eyes was there 
any perceptible difference: they 
looked as if she had withdrawn 
herself still further behind them. 

Duncan could not tell whether 
she knew or guessed anything. 
There seemed to be no way of 
finding out without planting the 
idea in her mind — if it were not 
already there. He was, without 
admitting it fully to himself, too 
nervous to turn on her viciously 
for the time she spent vacantly 
mooning out of the window. He 
had an uncomfortable awareness 
of how many ways there were for 
even a dimwit to contrive a fatal 
accident in such a place. 

As a precaution, he took to 



fitting new air-bottles to his suit 
every time he went out, and 
checking to see that they were at 
full pressure. He also took to 
placing a piece of rock so that 
the outer door of the airlock 
could not close behind him. He 
made a point of noticing that his 
food and hers came straight out 
of the same pot, and watched her 
closely while she worked. 

He still could not decide whether she knew, or suspected. After 
they were sure that Alan was 
gone, she never once mentioned 
his name . . , 

The mood stayed on her for 
perhaps a week. Then it changed 
abruptly. She paid no more attention to the bleakness outside. 
Instead, she began to read, voraciously and indiscriminately. 

Duncan found it hard to understand her absorption in the 
books, nor did he like it, but he 
decided for the moment not to 
interfere. It did, at least, have 
the advantage of keeping her 
mind off other things. 

Gradually he began to feel 
easier. The crisis was over. Either 
she had not guessed, or, if she 
had, she had decided to do nothing about it. Her addiction to 
books, however, did not abate. In 
spite of several reminders by 
Duncan that it was for company 
that he had laid out the not inconsiderable sum of $2,360, she 
continued, as if determined to 



DUMI MARTIAN 



*7 



work her way through the station's library, 

By degrees, the situation retreated into the background. 
When the next ship came, Duncan watched her anxiously in case 
she had been biding her time to 
hand on her suspicions to the 
crew. It turned out to be unnecessary. She showed no tendency to refer to the matter. 

When the ship pulled out, taking the opportunity with it, he 
was relievedly able to tell himself that he had really been right 
all along — she was just a dumb 
Mart. She had simply forgotten 
the Alan Whint incident, as a 
child might. 

AS the months of his term 
ticked steadily away, he 
found that he had, bit by bit, to 
revise that estimate of dumbness. 
She was learning from books 
tilings that he did not know himself. It even had some advantages, though it put him in a 
position he did not care for. When 
she asked, as she sometimes did 
now, for explanations, he found 
it unpleasant to be stumped by a 
Mart. 

Having the practical man's suspicion of book-acquired knowledge, he felt it necessary to explain to her how much of the 
stuff in them was a lot of nonsense, how they never really came 
to grips with the problems of life 



as he had lived it. He cited examples from his experience. 

In fact, he found himself teaching her. 

She learned quickly, too — the 
practical as well as the book 
stuff. Of necessity, he had to 
change his opinion of Marts even 
more. It wasn't that they were 
altogether dumb, as he had 
thought, just that they were normally too dumb to start using the 
brains they had. 

Once started, Lellie was a regular vacuum -cleaner for knowledge of all sorts. It didn't seem 
long before she knew as much 
about the wayload station as he 
did himself. Teaching her was 
not at all what he had intended, 
but it did provide more occupation than the boredom of the 
early days. Besides, it had occurred to him that she was an 
appreciating asset . . . 

Funny thing, that. He had 
never before thought of education as anything but a waste of 
time, but now it seriously began 
to look as if, when he got her 
back to Mars, he might recover 
quite a bit more of that $2,360 
than he had expected. Maybe 
she'd make quite a useful secretary to someone. 

He started to instruct her in 
elementary bookkeeping and finance — as much, at least, as he 
^ knew about it, which wasn't a 
great deal. 



it 




 



The months of service kept on 

piling up, going fastefr now. During the later stretch, when one 
had acquired confidence in his 
ability to get through without 
cracking up, there was a comfortable feeling about sitting 
quietly out there with the knowledge of the dollars gradually piling up at home. 

A new find opened up on Callisto, bringing a slight increase in 
deliveries to the satellite. Otherwise, the routine continued unchanged. The infrequent ships 
trailed in, loaded up, and went 
jjgain. And then, surprisingly 
moon, it was possible for Duncan 
to say to himself: 

"The ship after the next and 
I'll be through!" 

Even more surprisingly, there 
soon came the day when he stood 
on the metal apron outside the 
dome, watching a ship lifting herself off on her under jets and 
dwindling upward into the black 
sky, and was able to tell himself: 

"That's the last time I'll see 
that! When the next ship lifts off 
this dump, I'll be aboard her!" 

He stood watching her, one 
bright spark among the others, 
until the turn of the satellite carried her below his horizon. Then 
he turned back to the airlock — 
and found the door shut. 

Once he had seen that there 
was going to be no repercussion 
from the Alan Whint affair, he 



had dropped his habit of wedging 
it open with a piece, of rock. 
Whenever he emerged to do a 
job, he left it ajar, and it stayed 
that way until he came back. 
There was no wind or anything 
else on the satellite to move it. 

He laid hold of the latch-lever 
irritably and pushed. It did not 
move. 

Duncan swore at it for sticking. 
He walked to the edge of the 
metal apron, and then around the 
side of the dome so that he could 
see in at the window. Lellie was 
sitting in a chair with the springcover fixed across it, apparently 
lost in thought. The inner door 
of the airlock was standing open, 
so, of course, the outer could not 
be moved. Besides the safety 
locking device, there was all the 
dome's air-pressure to hold it 
shut. 

Forgetful for the moment, 
Duncan rapped on the thick glass 
of the double window to attract 
hec attention. She could not have 
heard a sound through there, so 
it must have been the movement 
that caught her eye and caused 
her to look up. She turned her 
head and gazed at him, without 
moving. 

Duncan stared back at her. 
Her hair was still waved, but the 
eyebrows, the color — all the other 
touches that he had insisted upon 
to make her look as much like an 
Earth woman as possible — were 



DUMB MARTIAN 



t9 



gone. Her eyes looked back at 
him, set as hard as stones in that 
fixed expression of mild astonishment. 

Sudden comprehension struck 
Duncan like a physical shock. He 
tried to pretend to both of them 
that he had not understood. He 
made gestures to her to close the 
inner door of the airlock. She 
went on staring back at him, 
without moving. Then he noticed 
the book she was holding in her 
hand, and recognized it. It was 
not one of the books which the 
Company had supplied for the 
station's library. It was a book of 
verse, bound in blue. 

It had once belonged to Alan 
Whint. 

¥]>A.NIC suddenly jumped out 
■■- at Duncan as he looked down 
at the row of small dials across 
his chest. At least she had not 
tampered with his air supply; 
there was pressure enough for 
thirty hours or so. A touch on 
the jet sent him floating back to 
the metal apron, where he could 
anchor his magnetic boots and 
think it over. 

The dirty Mart! Letting him 
think all this time that she had 
forgotten all about it. Nursing it 
up for him. Letting him work 
out his time while she planned. 
Waiting until he was on the very 
last stretch before she tried her 
game. 



Some minutes passed before his 
mixed anger and panic settled 
down and allowed him to think. 

Thirty hours! Time to do quite 
a lot. And even if he did not succeed in getting back into the 
dome in twenty hours or so, 
there would still be the last, desperate resort of shooting himself 
off to Callisto in one of the cylinder crates. 

Even if Lellie were to spill over 
later about the Whint business, 
what of it? He was sure enough 
that she did not know how it had 
been done. It would only be the 
word of a Mart against his own. 
Very likely they'd put her down 
as space-crazed. 

All the same, some of the mud 
might stick. It would be better to 
settle with her here and now. Besides, the cylinder idea was risky, 
to be considered only in the last 
extremity. 

Duncan jetted himself over to 
the smaller dome. In there, he 
threw out the switches on the 
lines which brought power down 
from the main batteries charged 
by the Sun motor, then sat down 
to wait. The insulated dome 
would take some time to lose all 
its heat, but not very long for a 
drop in the temperature to become perceptible, and visible on 
the thermometers, once the heat 
was off. The small -capacity lowvoltage batteries that were in the 
place wouldn't be much good to 



70 



• ALAXr SCIEfrct FICTION 



her, even if she did think of Jin-' 
ing them up. 

He waited an hour, while the 
faraway Sun set, and the bright 
arc of Callisto began to show over 
the horizon. Then he went back 
to the dome's window to observe 
results. He arrived just in time to 
see Lellie fastening herself into 
her spacesuit by the light of a 
couple of emergency lamps. 

He swore. A simple freezing 
out process wasn't going to work, 
then. Not only would the heated 
suit protect her, but her air supply would last longer than his — 
and there were plenty of spare 
bottles in there, even if the free 
air in the dome froze solid. 

He waited until she had put on 
the helmet, and then switched on 
the radio in his own. He saw her 
pause at the sound of his voice, 
but she deliberately switched off 
her receiver. He did not; he kept 
his open, to be ready for the moment when she would come to her 
senses. 

T\UNCAN returned to the 
apron and reconsidered. It 
had been his intention to force 
his way into the dome without 
damaging it, if he could. But if 
she wasn't to be frozen out, that 
looked difficult. She had the advantage in air, and though it was 
true that in her spacesuit she 
-could neither eat nor drink, the 
same, unfortunately, was true for 



him. The only way seemed to be 
to tackle the dome itself. 

Reluctantly, he went back to 
the small dome again and connected up the electrical cutter. 
Its cable looped behind him as he 
jetted across to the main dome 
once more. Beside the curving 
metal wall, he paused to think 
out the job — and the consequences. 

Once he was through the outer 
shell there would be a space, then 
the insulating material— that was 
all right; it would melt away like 
butter, and without oxygen it 
could not catch fire. The more 
awkward part was going to come 
with the inner metal skin. It 
would be wisest to start with a 
few small cuts to let the airpressure down — and stand clear 
of it. If it were all to come out 
with a whoosh, he would stand 
a good chance, in his weightless 
state, of being blown a considerable distance by it. 

And what would she do? She*d 
very likely try covering up the 
holes as he made them — a bit 
awkward if she had the sense to 
use asbestos packing. It'll have to 
be the whoosh then. 

Both shells could be welded 
up again before he re-aerated 
the, place from cylinders. The 
small loss of insulating material 
wouldn't matter. Okay, better get 
down to it, then . . . 

He made his connections and 



DUMB MARTI*!' 



71 



contrived to anchor himself 
enough to give some purchase. 
He brought the cutter up and 
pressed the trigger - switch. He 
pressed again and then swore, 
remembering that he had shut 
off the power. 

Pulling himself back along the 
cable, he pushed the switches in, 
again. Light from the dome's windows suddenly illuminated the 
rocks. He wondered if the restoration of power would let Lellie 
know what he was doing. Hell 
with it. She'd know soon enough. 

He settled himself down beside 
the dome once more. This time 
the cutter worked. It took only a 
few minutes to slice out a rough 
two -foot circle. He pulled the 
piece out of the way and inspected the opening. Then, as he 
leveled the cutter again, there 
came a click in his receiver. 

"Better not try to break in," 
Lellie said. "I'm ready for that." 

He hesitated, checking himself 
with his finger on the switch, 
wondering what counter - move 
she could have thought up. The 
threat in her voice made him uneasy. He decided to go around to 
the window and see what her 
game was, if she had one. 

She was standing by the table, 
still dressed in her spacesuit, fiddling with some apparatus she 
had set up there. For a moment 
or two he did not grasp the purpose of it. 



There was a plastic food bag, 
half - inflated, and attached in 
some way to the table top. She 
was adjusting a metal plate over 
it to a small clearance. There was 
a wire taped to the upper side of 
the bag. Duncan's eye ran back 
along the wire to a battery, a 
coil, and on to a detonator attached to a bundle of half a dozen 
blasting-sticks. 

He was uncomfortably enlightened. If the air-pressure in the 
room fell, the bag would expand; 
the wire would make contact with 
the plate; up would go the 
dome . . . 

T ELLIE finished her adjustment and connected the second wire to the battery. She 
turned to look at him through the 
window. Duncan found it was infuriatingly difficult to believe 
that, behind that silly-surprise 
frozen on her face, she could be 
aware of what she was doing. 

He tried to speak to her, but 
she had switched off and made no 
attempt to switch on again. She 
simply stood looking steadily 
back at him as he blustered and 
raged. After some minutes, she 
moved across to a chair, fastened 
the spring-cover across herself, 
and sat waiting. 

"All right, then,** Duncan 
shouted inside his helmet. "But 
you'll go up with it, damn you!** 
Which was, of course, nonsense.

since he had no intention whatever of destroying either the dome 
or himself. 

He had never learned to tell 
what went on behind that absurd 
face. She might be coldly determined, or she might not. If it 
had been a matter of a switch 
that she had to press to destroy 
the place, he might have risked 
lier nerve failing her. But this 
way, it would be he who operated the switch, just as soon as 
he made a hole to let the air out. 

Once more he retreated to anchor himself on the apron. There 
must be some way of getting into 
the dome without letting the 
pressure down . . . 

No, there was no way that he 
could think of. It would have to 
be the cylinder crate to Callisto. 

He looked up at Callisto. hanging huge in the sky now, with 
Jupiter smaller, but brighter, beyond. It wasn't so much the 
flight, it was the landing there. 
Perhaps if he were to cram it with 
all the padding he could find . . . 
Later on, he could get the Callisto crew to ferry him back, and 
they'd find some way to get into 
the dome, and Lellie would be a 
mighty sorry girl — mighty sorry. 

Across the clearing there were 
three cylinders lined up. charged 
and ready for use. He didn't mind 
admitting he was scared of that 
landing; but, scared or not, if she 
wouldn't even turn on her radio 



to listen to him, that would be hit 

only chance. 

He made up his mind and step- ped off the metal apron. A touch 
on the jets sent him floating 
across the clearing toward the 
cylinders. Practice made it easy 
to maneuver the nearest one onto 
the ramp. Another glance at Callisto's inclination helped to reassure him; at least he would reach 
it all right. If their beacon was 
not switched on to bring him in, 
he ought to be able to call them 
on the communication radio in 
his suit when he got closer. 

He fetched more padding from 
the other cylinders, and packed 
the stuff in. While he paused to 
figure out a way of triggering the 
thing off with himself inside, he 
realized he was beginning to feel 
cold. As he turned the knob up a 
notch, he glanced down at the 
meter on his chest. The cold became a chill of horror. 

Lellie hadn't tampered with the 
flasks of air — she'd known, damn 
her, that he would check them. 
Instead, she must have shorted 
the battery or the heating circuit 
in the suit. The voltage was down 
so low that the needle barely 
kicked. Another few minutes and 
he might as well be naked in the 
cold of space, for the suit, without its heating unit, would be no 
protection whatever. 

After its first stab, the fear 
abruptly left him, giving way to 



DUMB MARTIAN 



71 



fury. She'd tricked him out of his 
last chance, but, by God, he could 
make sure she didn't get away 
with it! One small hole in the 
dome and he wouldn't die alone... 

The cold was lapping at him 
icily through the suit. He pressed 
the jet control and sent himself 
scudding back toward the dome. 

His feet and fingers were going 
first. Only by an immense effort 
was he able to operate the jet 
which stopped him by the dome. 

He struggled to press the control that would jet him down to 
it, but his fingers would no longer 
move. He wept and panted with 
the attempt to make them work. 

There was an agonizing, searing pain in his chest. He gasped 
- — and the unheated air rushed 
into his lungs and froze them. 

IN the dome's living room, Lellie stood waiting. She had seen 
the spacesuited figure come 
sweeping across the clearing at an 
abnormal speed. She understood 
what it meant. Her explosive device was already disconnected; 
now she stood alert, with a thick 
rubber mat in her hand, ready to 
clap it over any hole that might 
appear. She waited one minute, 
two minutes . . . 

When five minutes had passed, 
she went to the window. By putting her face close to the pane 
and looking sideways, she was 
able to see the whole of one 



armorclad leg and part of another. They hung there, horizontally, a few feet off the 
ground. She watched them for 
several minutes. 

She left the window, pushing 
the mat out of her hand so that it 
floated away across the room. For 
a moment or two she stood thinking. Then she went to the bookshelves and pulled out the last 
volume of the encyclopedia. She 
read long enough to satisfy herself on the exact status and 
claims which were connoted by 
the word "widow." 

She found a pad of paper and 
a pencil. She hesitated, trying to 
remember the method she had 
been taught. Then she started to 
write down figures, and became 
absorbed in them. 

At last she lifted her head and 
contemplated the result: $5,000 a 
year for five years, at 6% compound interest. 

But then she paused again. 
Very likely, a face that was not 
set forever in a look of surprised 
innocence would have frowned, 
because, naturally, there was a 
debit of $2,360. 

Being incapable of both, Lellie 
neither smiled nor frowned. She 
gravely 'entered the $2,360 as a 
capital investment and the balance as profit. 

It was quite a fortune for a 
dumb Mart.

3000 million years old and that 
it is still in one piece does not invalidate the question: Can worlds 
collide? 

Well, lei's attack the problem 
Systematically. First, a few fundamental astronomical facts. 
Nine planets, of assorted sizes, 
swing around the Sun. The closer 
to the Sun they are, the faster 
they move in their orbits. Their 
orbits art separated by many millions of miles. They all move 
around the Sun in the same direction, counter-clockwise if you 
look at the whole from the celestial north pole. And they all move 
in very nearly the same plane. 
If you made a precise scale model 
of the Solar System, it would fit 
into a round box which has to 
have a diameter of four feet, but 
would need to be only five inches 
deep. And if you left out Pluto 
and Mercury, the two that deviate most from the general plane 
of the Solar System, the box 
could be reduced to a height of 
three inches. 

Under these circumstances, no 
collisions between members of 
our own solar system are possible. 
Even if we imagine that, for completely unknown reasons, one of 
the outer planets slowed down 
nnd approached the Sun, it still 
would not lead to a collision. For 
while the planes of the various 
planetary oibits are very close to 
the plane of Earth's orbit, the 



ecliptic, they are not precisely the 
same. The presumed new orbit 
of a slowed-down outer planet 
might cross the orbit of Earth, 
but because of the fact that the 
planes of the various orbits fail 
to coincide perfectly, the two orbits would cross not in the manner of two crossing streets, but 
more like a bridge crossing a 
street or a street crossing a tunnel. 

Then what happened to the 
presumed Planet Five, which is 
now the Asteroid Belt? Wc can't 
be sure, but we are pretty certain 
that it was not a collision. The 
total mass of all the asteroids 
still makes only a very small 
planet, somewhere between our 
moon (2160 miles in diameter) 
and the planet Mercury (3100 
miles in diameter) in size. And 
that very small planet happened 
to be nearest the largest planet of 
our system, Jupiter (diameter 
86,700 miles). About 150 years 
ago, when only the four largest 
bodies of the Asteroid Belt were 
known, the discoverer of two of 
them, Heinrich W. M. Olbers, 
M.D., suggested for the first time 
that they may have originated by 
the explosion of one planet. 

If that was really the case, it 
should be possible to reconstruct 
the orbit of the original planet 
from the orbits of the four big 
chunks of debris. And in the 
pursuit of that calculation one 
would also be able to fix the ap

proximate date of the event. The 
calculation was not made then, 
partly because it would have been 
a difficult and exceedingly tedious 
job, partly because astronomers, 
both professionals and amateurs, 
kept adding and adding to the 
list of minor planets. But much 
later, only a few decades ago. 
Prof. K. Hirayama did go to 
work on the problem of calculating the original orbit of the 
presumed disrupted planet from 
the orbits of the presumed fragments. 

Interestingly enough, Prof. Hirayama did not find a common 
origin. Instead, he found five different origins, one each for five 
so-called "families" of planetoids. 
There was the one named the 
Flora Family, after its brightest 
member. Flora (#8) is the member of a family of 57. Maria 
(#170) is a member of a family 
of 13; Koronis (#158) is a member of a family of 15; Eos (#221) 
is one of a family of 23; and, 
finally, Themis (#24) is one of a 
family of 25. For each of these 
families, a common origin could 
be calculated, but it was impossible to trace the story farther 
back, all of which seems to indicate that there never was an original Planet Five. Presumably, 
Jupiter's gravitational pull prevented it from forming and, instead of one planet, more than 
five tiny planets formed in that 



area, which later, one by one, 
were torn apart again by Jupiter. 

Whether or not Professor Hirayama is correct with this conclusion matters little for our present 
purpose. The so-called Asteroid 
Belt did not originate by way of 
a collision— even though minor 
collisions in the Belt now are 
probably responsible for the meteorites that fall to Earth. 

But why look to other planets 
for a collision? Aren't there some 
theories around which state that 
the Moon is slowly approaching 
Earth? And even though its diameter is only about one -quarter 
of the diameter of Earth, that 
should make a sufficiently destructive impact. 

However, tiiere are a few natural laws in the way which are 
usually referred to as "Roche's 
Limit/* named after the French 
astronomer E. Roche of Montpellier, who made a certain calculation in 1850. The calculation was 
this : Suppose that a satellite 
slowly approached its planet in 
an orbit like a tightly wound spiral. (It couldn't have any other 
shape.) Then this satellite would 
raise stronger and stronger tides 
on the planet. But the planet 
would also raise tides in its satellite's crust. And since the planet 
is bigger and its gravitation 
stronger, it would win. Under the 
stress of the tidal forces exerted 
by the planet, the satellite would

Saturn and its rings seen from a point directly above Saturn's 
northern pole. The main division of the rings is known as 
Cassini's Division, the fine division in the outer ring as 
Cncke's Division, both named after their discoverers. Mimas 
is Saturn's innermost satellite, well outside Roche's Limit. 



break up, layer after layer would 
be peeled off and the debris would 
form a ring around the planet. 
The pieces forming the ring might 
still crash, but they would be 
just pieces, strong falls of meteoric matter, no shattering impact. 

The distance at which this 
would take place would depend 
c»n several factors — the relative 
densities of planet and satellite 
and, to some extent, the tensile 
strength of the material forming 
the satellite. Roche calculated 
that a satellite of the same density 
as its planet and being liquid (in 
-a loose sense of the word) could 
»ot exist within 2.4 radii from the 
planet's center. 



Saturn's rings (see diagram) 
are well inside Roche's Limit. 
Again it is an open question 
whether the rings are the remains 
of a moon which was broken up 
by Saturn's tidal forces, or 
whether they are material which 
could not condense into a moon, 
because they were situated where 
no moon is possible. 

Almost a century after Roche, 
Prof. H. Jeffreys undertook the 
job of finding out how small a 
rocky satellite would have to be 
to escape the forces which constitute Roche's Limit. In 1947 he 
announced that a satellite of solid 
rock would have to be larger than 
about 130 miles in diameter to 
be disrupted by the tidal force*

EARTH S ORBIT 



Diagram of the orbit of a hypothetical "Intruder" coming into 
the Solar System on an orbit almost vertical to that of the ecliptic. Some comets do have similar 
orbits, but none is known to 
have hit Earth, if one did, It 
would be a purely local 
catastrophe. 



which Earth could exert upon it. 
But even a 100-mile satellite — if 
there were one — would not hit 
Earth as a whole. Since it would 
enter the atmosphere pretty 
nearly tangentially ("horizontal"), it would be shattered by 
unequal heating. 

How, then, could another 
planet — say, the planet of another 
sun — hit Earth? Only if it approached in such a manner ttoat 



there is no time for an effective 
interplay of tidal forces. The diagram shows a typical comet orbit, 
strongly inclined to the ecliptic, 
coming from "above." If such 
an orbit crossed that of Earth and 
if both Earth and intruder happen to arrive at the same spot in 
the same, instant, there would be 
a collision. 

But now let's see: the nearest 
other sun is, in round figures. 24 
million million miles away. The 
average velocity of a sun moving 
through space is much less than 
one per cent of the velocity of 
light, usually somewhere between 
0.01 and 0.025 of one per cent of 
that velocity. 

Let's assume that the nearest 
star moved with a velocity of one 
per cent of that of light, which it 
doesn't, and that it were aimed 
for a collision point with our sun, 
which it isn't. 

It would need four centuries to 
strike. 

If one has to worry about something, there arc more urgent problems than the possibility of cosmic collision. 

THE SIX-LEGGED GHOST 

1 DON'T have any particular 
reason for talking about the 
insect M yrmecophana, but 1 don't 
see why I should need one. I am 
simply amused by what happened and the gist of the story is 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



7t 



that there is no such insect. 

It began quite harmlessly with 
a small box which the mailman 
banded to Merr Professor Dr. 
Brunner von Wattenwyl one day 
in 1883. Dr. von Wattenwyl was 
■n entomologist and he didn't 
really have to read the letter that 
came with the small box. There 
were some insects in it, sent for 
proper classification. The insects 
were ants which had been collected in East Africa. They were 
new to the man who had-collected 
them. Were they also new to 
■cience? 

When Brunner von Wattenwyl 
looked at them carefully, he saw 
that they were indeed new to science. And they were not even 
ants. They were related to the 
locusts, but masqueraded as ants. 

The thick body had a green 
triangle on each side, quite conspicuous against the background 
•f a white sheet of paper. But if 
placed on a leaf, these two green 
triangles imitated the narrow 
"waistline" of an ant. Likewise, 
the legs were striped black and 
green lengthwise, so that only the 
black center stripe showed clearly. That stripe had the width of 
an ant's leg. Even the antennae, 
longer than those of an ant, were 
camouflaged. At the precise point 
where the feelers of an ant would 
come to an end, there was a white 
aectfbn which seemed to cut it 

•jr. 



Brunner von Wattenwyl suspected — he could not know for 
sure, since he worked with dried 
specimens, but his suspicion was 
justified — that this camouflaged 
grasshopper also behaved like an 
ant when alive. 

What remained to be done was 
to invent a scientific name. Well, 
here was an insect which did its 
best to look like an ant. One 
might say that it "ghosted" an 
ant. Hence, von Wattenwyl called 
it "ant-ghost," Myriftecophana. 

That ended the story for on interval of more than two decades, 
when a traveling zoologist, one 
Dr. Vosseler (later director of the 
Zoological Garden of Hamburg), 
happened across M yrmecophana 
in East Africa. 

It mingled with true ants, cavorting like them. 

Vosseler, unaware of the earlier 
description, was struck by some 
minor differences, collected some 
of the "new species of ant" and 
took them with him, alive. 

Kept in wire cages for later 
classification, the pseudo-ants 
seemed to be growing a little, 
though insects, once they have 
reached the adult form, rarely 
grow larger. And then, one day, 
they began to change. The 
pseudo-ants, as they changed 
shape, also changed their behavior. No nervous running any 
more, stately calmness instead. 
They had become leaf insects, 



GALAXY ICIINCI FICTION 



now imitating the leaves of plants, 
sitting still if possible and moving 
slowly when moving became necessary. 

And with that observation 
Myrmecophana became a "ghost" 
of another kind. For the finished 
leaf insect was already known 
to science under the label Eurycorypha. The pseudo-ant was recognized as the larval form of the 
pseudo-leaf. And its separate 
name was officially deleted. 

MOON OF VENUS 

¥> EADING over my first column about the moons of the 
Solar System, I find myself guilty 
of an omission: I didn't say anything about the satellite of Venus. 

But Venus, you'll object, does 
Aot have a moon. I know that. 
However, the moon which Venus 
does not have has a story and 
I think it worth telling. 

It began during the year 1645. 
Some thirty -five years earlier, 
Galileo Galilei had discovered 
the four large moons of Jupiter, 
and astronomers began to look 
for moons of other planets. In 
the year mentioned a Neapolitan, 
Francesco Fontana, announced 
that Venus had a fairly small, 
bright moon. Telescopes were still 
rare and weak, so other observers 
were not surprised if they failed 
to see it. 

Some time later, Fontana's dis


covery was corroborated by as 
important a man as Jean Dominique Cassini. Cassini had discovered one of Saturn's moons 
(Japetus) in 1671 and had announced still another moon of 
Saturn (Rhea) in 1672, the same 
year in which he reported seeing 
the satellite of Venus. (Later Cassini found two more of Saturn's 
moons, Tethys and Dione.) Cassini said that he had seen something that might have been 
Vcnus's moon as early as 1666, 
but he had not been sure at the 
time. 

After that the Venus satellite 
was "lost" again, but its reality 
could not be doubted — Cassini 
himself had seen iti Roughly « 
century after the original discovery by Fontana, several other observers went on record as witnesses for the existence of a moon 
of Venus. Short in England saw 
it in 1740; Mayer in Greifswald 
in 1759; Montaigne in Limoges, 
France and Rodkier in Copenhagen both observed it for several days in 1761. The angular 
distance from the planet, they reported, was between 20 and 2S 
minutes of arc. Three years later, 
in 1764, Horrebow in Copenhagen 
and Montbarron in Auxerre verified the observations of their respective compatriots, Rodkier 
and Montaigne. 

There was just one uncooperative fact in the way. Since Venus 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



is closer to the Sun than we are, 

it happens on rare occasions that 
the planet is in line of sight between us and the Sun, a performance technically known as a 
"transit." If Venus had a satellite, 
it should show up beautifully as 
a black spot against the blinding 
background of the Sun's disk. 
Venus transits are rare, but just 
at the period under discussion 
there were two of them, in 1761 
and in 1769. They were observed 
carefully for many different reasons, but nobody detected even 
a trace of a Venus satellite. 

The Viennese astronomer. 
Father Maximilian Hell, S. J., 
after whom Hell Crater on the 
Moon is named, drew the conclusion that Montaigne and Montbarron, Rbdkier and Horrebow, 
Mayer and Short — and, yes, even 
the great Cassini — must have 
been mistaken. Venus is a very 
bright planet, bright enough to 
cause a reflection on the cornea 
of the eye of the observer. This 
reflection will be reflected, in turn, 
on the eyepiece of the telescope 
and then be "seen" by the observer. Of course, it will not coincide with the image of the 
planet, but produce a tiny blight 
spot nearby. Thus Father Hell in 
1766. 

But the satellite of Venus had 
too much momentum by then. 
Johann Heinrich Lambert — writing in French like a good German 



of his time — published an Essai 
tf une theorie du satellite de 

Venus in Berlin in 1773 in which 
he tried to calculate the orbit of 
that moon. Frederick the Great 
of Prussia read it and decided 
that this was a fine opportunity 
to honor the philosopher and 
mathematician Jean Le Rond 
d'Alembert by naming the moon 
of Venus d'Alembert. If d'Alembert had not refused the honor 
— we don't know why — there 
would have been a royal degree 
to that effect. 

By 1800, all astronomers were 
agreed that Venus did not have 
a moon. But they also agreed that 
Father Hell's ingenious explanation was not good enough. 
Though something like that 
might fool a beginner, the majority of those who had seen the 
satellite of Venus had been competent men. The puzzle was not 
solved until 1887 when a Belgian 
astronomer, P. Stroobant, reviewed the whole case. Stroobant 
asked himself the obvious question: "Just where was Venus located in the sky when the various 
observers thought they saw a 
satellite?" 

Since precise records existed, 
this question was easy to answer. 
Stroobant simply looked up the 
positions of Venus for those days 
and entered them on a good star 
map. And he found that in every 
case there had been a relatively 



82 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



bright fixed star in the immediate 

neighborhood of Venus. On one 
occasion mu Tauri had been less 
than half a degree of arc from 
Venus. On other occasions it was 
65 Orionis or 71 Orionis, just 



blight enough to be seen by the 
naked eye. 

That was the end of the search 
for the moon of Venus.

ANY QUESTIONS? 



How many Jovian satellites 
would be visible to an observer 
on Jupiter, assuming that there 
ate no clouds? 

Gary B. Dunkel 
4107 Alta 
Fresno 2, Calif. 

He could see the four large 
satellites — lo, Europa, Ganymede and CalHslo — with the 
naked eye. Willi a small portable telescope, lie could also see 
Moon No. V, which is closest lo 
Jupiter. All the others would 
need rather powerful telescopes 
because they are very small and 
comparatively slow -moving. 

Isaac Asimov and other science 
fiction writers have used the word 
"parsec" on several occasions. 
What is a parsec and how is its 
Value derived? 

Is there any phenomenon 
known which would aid instantaneous or speed -of -light transmis~ 
sion of matter? 

David Shafer 

1910 Andina Avenue 

Cincinnati, Ohio 



Parsec means a distance 
which produces a PARallax of 
one SECond of are, an appar* 
ent yearly shift of 1 3600th of 
one degree of arc. Expressed 
arithmetically, one parsec is 
3.259 light-years. 

No, we don't know of any 
phenomenon that would make 
transmission of matter possible, 
assuming you mean disassembling molecules in one place 
and reassembling them else* 
where. The speed is not very 
important at this point; achieving it at all is the problem. It 
seems somewhat unlikely at 
present. But so did atomic 
power in 1940. 

I do not question the value of 
a space station as an observation 
point and for research, but why 
does every writer on the subject 
consider it invincible from a military standpoint? Why wouldn't 
it be just as easy for those on the 
ground to intercept missiles fired 
by the space station?

Suppose the space station 
belongs to the USA, involved in 
a shooting war with the Empire 
of Africa and Madagascar. The 
missiles from the space station 
would then he released while 
the station is over the Pacific, 
close to 180 degrees around the 
glohe. The ground radars would 
not he aide to pick up the missiles until too late, since they 
would come in over the horizon at a shallow angle. Also, 
they would not be able to tell 
whether the target is Cape 
Town, Tananarive, Libreville 
or Nairobi. But the people on 
the station would know what 
the target is going to he for any 
niisMile that rises from the atmosphere. Hence the station 
would have a much easier job 
of interception. It might not be 
completely invincible, hut it 
certainly would have the advantage. 

"Escape velocity'* is my pet 
peeve. If we had a good enough 
fuel, we could creep out of this 
world at one mile per hour. 

Pic. Robert A. Vignerot 
Fort Lawton, Washington 
Of course, if we had enough 
fuel, we could move out of the 
gravitational field of Earth as 
gradually as we please. The fig


ure of seven miles per second 
for lite escape velocity is merely 
one way of expressing the 
amount of work to he done. 
But it is another question of 
whether such "creeping out" 
would be practical. 

Consider: in Destination 
Moon they assumed an average 
acceleration of six g which 
made the ship attain escape 
velocity three minutes and 60 
seconds after takeoff, at which 
lime the ship would be 800 
miles above the surface. To 
climb to 800 miles at the rate 
of 1000 miles per hour would 
lake 8/lOths of an hour or 
48 minutes* During that climb 
to 800 miles altitude, Earth 
pulls the spaceship hack at an 
average rale of about 30 feet 
per second for every second 
elapsed. This loss of speed must 
be made up by expenditure of 
fuel. 

In the first case, the ebmh to 
800 miles was accomplished in 
230 seconds. In the second 
case, the climb to the same 
height took 2880 seconds. 
After figuring out how much 
effect Earth's gravity would 
have in either case, you'll probably stop wondering why rocket 
men insist in attaining escape 
velocity as quickly as possible.

"Listen," she said. 

I could smell it coming; that

she isn't even aware of any more, 
but which comes every time she's 
about to make one of her "revelations" to me. 

"Yes, dear," I said. I leaned

"You get that expression off

forebodings, "what if the place

just want people here for a coverup? That would explain the rent. 
You remember the rush on this 
place when they started renting?" 

I remember as well as Phil and 
Ruth and Marge. The only reason we'd got apartments was we 
all happened to be walking past 
the place when the janitor put 
out the renting sign. The four of 
us had gone right in. I remember 
our amazement, our delight, at 
the rental. Why, we'd been paying more than double for half 
the size and ratty furniture, besides. 

Phil and Marge and Ruth and 
I were the first tenants. The next 
day was like the Alamo under

"I say there's something funny 
about it," Ruth finished. "And 
did you ever notice that janitor?" 

"He's a creep," I contributed. 

"He is," Marge laughed. "My

"Men are all blind," Marge

Phil and I lit cigarettes. 

"No kidding now," I said, so

He shrugged. "I don't know,

She held my hand as we went

"When did you see them?" I

The janitor's voice behind us 
was sort of like Lorre's, low and 
insinuating. 

Ruth gasped, caught way off 
guard. I jumped a bit myself. 

"My wife thinks there's a — ** 

"I was showing him the right 
way to hang a picture," Ruth 
interrupted hastily. "That's the 
way, babe." She turned toward 
me. "You put the nail in at an 
angle, not straight in. Now do 
you understand?" 

The janitor smiled. 

"See you," I said awkwardly. I 
felt his eyes on us as we walked 
back to the elevator. 

When the doors shut, Ruth 
turned quickly. 

"Good night !" she stormed. 
"What are you tryin to do, get 
him on us?" 

"What . . . ?" 

"Never mind," she said. "There 
are engines down there. Huge 
engines. I saw them. And he 
knows about them." 

"Baby," I said, "why don't . . 

"Look at me," she said quickly. 

I looked. 

"Do you think I'm crazy?" she 
asked. "Come on, now. Never 
mind the hesitation." 

I sighed. "I think you're hnaginative." 

She looked disgusted. "You're

as bad as . . /* 

"You and Galileo," I added. 
"It's tough being ahead of your 
generation. Happens, though, to 
every genius." 

"I'll show you those things," 
she said. "We're going down there 
again tonight, when that janitor 
is asleep. If he's ever asleep." 

I got worried. "Honey, cut it 
out. You'll get me started, too." 

"Good," she said. "Good. I 
thought it would take a hurricane." 

I sat staring at my typewriter 
all afternoon, nothing coining out. 
But concern. 

I didn't get it. Was she actually 
serious? All right, I thought, I'll 
take it seriously. She saw a door 
that was left open. Accidentally. 
That was obvious. If there really 
were huge engines under the 
apartment house, as she said, then 
the people who built them damn 
well wouldn't want anyone to 
know about them. 

East 7 th Street. An apartment 
house. And huge engines underneath it. 

Now where's the sense in that? 

SHE was shaking: Her face was 
white. She stared at me like 
a kid who's read her first horror 
story. 

"The janitor has three eyes.'" 
"Honey," I said. I put my arms 

around her. She was really scared. 

I felt sort of scared myself. And 

SHIPSHAPE HOME 



not about the janitor having an 
extra eye, either. 

I didn't say anything at first. 
What can you say when your 
wife comes up with something 
like that? 

She shook a long time. Then 
she spoke in a quiet voice, a timid 
voice: "You don't believe me." 

I swallowed. "Baby," I said 
helplessly. 

"We're going down tonight,** 
she stated. "This is really important now. It's nothing to joke 
about." 

"I don't think we should . . .** 
I started to say. 

"I'm going down there." She 
sounded edgy now, a little hysterical. "I tell you there are engines down there. Goddam it, 
there are engines!" 

She started crying now. I patted her head, rested it against my 
shoulder. 

"AH right, baby," I said. "All 
right." 

She tried to tell me through her 
tears, but it wouldn't work. Later, 
when she'd calmed down, I listened. I didn't want to get her 
upset. 1 figured the safest way 
was just to listen. 

"I was walking through the hall 
downstairs," she said. "I thought 
maybe there was some afternoon 
mail. You know, once in a while 
our mailman will . . ." 

"I know, hon," I soothed. "He 
comes around with another mail

when the deliveries are heavy." 

She stopped. "Never mind that. 
What matters is that 1 walked 
past the janitor." 

"And?" I asked, afraid of what 
was coming. 

"He smiled," she said. "You 
know the way he does. Sweet and 
murderous." 

I didn't argue the point. I still 
didn't think the janitor was anything but a harmless guy who had 
the misfortune to be born with a 
face that was strictly from 
Charles Addams. 

4 'So?" I said. '*Then what?'' 

"I walked pas^t him. I felt myself shivering, because he looked 
at me as if he knew something 
about me I didn't even know. I 
don't care what you say, that's 
the feeling I got. And then . . ." 

She shuddered. I took her hand. 

"Then?" 

**I felt him looking at me." 

I'd felt that, too, when he had 
found us in the basement. I knew 
what she meant. You actually 
felt the guy looking at you. 

"All right," I said, "I'll buy 
that." 

"You won't buy this," she went 
on grimly. "When I turned 
around to took, lie was walking 
away from me." 

"Oh, you both turned at the 
same time?" 

She slapped the table. "I 
turned. He didn't." 

"But you just said — " 



"He was looking at me. He was 
walking away and his head was to 
the front and he was looking at 
me." 

I sat there numbly. I patted 
her hand without even knowing I 
was doing it. 

"How , hon ? " I hea rd m y self 
asking her. 

"There was an eye in the back 
of his head." 

"Hon!" I said. 

She closed her eyes. She clasped 
her hands after drawing away the 
one I was holding. She pressed 
her Hps together. I saw a tear 
wriggle out from under her left 
eyelid and roll dowp her cheek. 
She was white. 

"I saw it," she said quietly. 
"So help me, I saw that eye." 

I don't know why I went on 
with it. Self-torture, I guess. I 
really wanted to forget the whole 
thing, pretend it never even happened, but I couldn't leave it at 
that. 

"Why haven't we noticed it 
before, Ruth?" I asked. "We've 
seen the back of the man's head 
before." 

"Have we?" she said. "Have 
we?" 

"Sweetheart, somebody must 
have seen it. Do you think there's 
never anybody behind him?" 

"His hair parted. Rick, and before I ran away, I saw the hair 
going back over it. So you 
couldn't see it."

What could a guy possibly say 
to his wife when she talks to him 
like that? You're nuts? You're 
batty? Or the old, tired, "You've 
been working too hard"? She 
hadn't been working too hard. I 
make a living on my writing. 
Then, again, maybe she had been 
working overtime. 

With her imagination. 

"Are you going down with me 
tonight?" she asked. 

"All right," I said quietly. "All 
right, sweetheart. Now will you 
go and lie down for a while?" 

"But it's nothing like that." 

"Sweetheart, go and lie- down,*' 
I said firmly. "I'll go with you 
toniglit, but I want you to lie 
down now." 

She went into the bedroom and 
I heard the springs squeak as she 
sat down, then again when she 
drew up her legs and fell back on 
the pillow. 

1 went in a little later to put a 
comforter over her. She was looking at the ceiling. I didn't say 
anything to her. I don't think she 
wanted to talk to me. 

"T"f/HAT c a n 1 d o?" I said to 
" Phil. 

Ruth was asleep. I'd sneaked 
across the hall to Phil's apartment. 

"Maybe she saw them," he 
said. "Isn't it possible?" 

"Yeah, sure," I said. "And you 
know what else is possible.** 



"Look, you want to go down 
and see the jaintor? You want 
to . . .** 

"No," I said. "There's nothing 

we can do." 

"You're going down to the 
basement with her?" 

"If she keeps insisting," I said. 
"Otherwise, no." 

"When you go, come and get 
us/' 

I frowned ,at him ctfriously. 
"You mean the thing is getting 
you, too?" 

He looked at me in a funny 
way. I saw his throat move. 

"Don't tell anyone," he said. 

He glanced around. Then he 
turned back. 

"Marge told me the same 
thing," he added. "She said the 
janitor has three eyes." 

¥ WENT out after supper for 
, some ice cream. Johnson was 
still walking around. 

"They're working you overtime," I said as he started to walk 
beside me. 

"They expect some trouble 
from the local gangs," he explained in that serious kidding 
way of his. 

"I never saw any trouble," I 
said distractedly. 

He shrugged. **They say to 
come here, 1 come." 

"Mmmm." 

"How's your wife?" he added. 
"Fine," I lied.

"She still think the apartment 

is a front?" 

I swallowed. "No," I said- "I've 
broken her of that. I think she 
was just needling me all the 
time." 

He nodded and left me at the 
corner. For some reason, I 
couldn't keep my hands from 
shaking all the way home. I kept 
looking over my shoulder, too. 

"TJ ICK. it's time," Ruth said. 

-1* I grunted and rolled on 
my side. She nudged me. I woke 
up sort of hazy and looked automatically at the clock. The radium numbers told me it was almost four o'clock. 

"You want to go now?'* I 
asked, too sleepy to be tactful. 

There was a silence. That woke 
me up. 

. "Do you?" I insisted. 

"I'm going," she said quietly. 

I looked at her in the half -darkness, my heart starting to do a 
drum beat too heavily. My mouth 
and throat felt dry. 

"All right," I said, "wait till I 
get dressed." 

She was dressed already. I 
heard her in the kitchen making 
some coffee while I put on my 
clothes. There was no noise. I 
mean it didn't sound as if her 
hands were shaking. She spoke 
lucidly, too. But when I stared 
into the bathroom cabinet mirror, 
I saw a worried husband. 1 



washed my face with cold water 
and combed my hair. 

"Thanks," I said as she handed 
me the cup of steaming coffee. 
I stood there, nervous before my 
own wife. 

She didn't drink any coffee. 

"Are you awake?" she asked. 
I nodded. I noticed the flashlight 
and the screwdriver on the 
kitchen table. I finished the coffee. 

"I'm ready," I said, "Let's get 
it over with." 

I felt her hand on my arm. 

"I hope you'll . . ." she started. 
Then she turned her face. 

"What?" 

"Nothing," she said. "We'd 
better go." 

The house was dead quiet as 
we went into the hall. We were 
halfway to the elevator when I 
remembered Phil and Marge. I 
told her. 

"We can't wait," she said. "It'll 
be light soon." 

"I'll just go see if they're up," 
I said. "It won't take a minute.** 

She didn't say anything. She 
stood by the elevator door. I went 
down the hall and knocked quietly on the door of their apartment. 
There was no answer. I glanced 
up the hall. 

She was gone. 

I felt my heart lurch. Even 
though I was sure there was no 
danger in the basement, it scared 
me. 



GALAXY SCI E NCI FICTION 



"Ruth I" I called out and 

headed for the stairs. 

"Wait a second!" I heard Phil 
yell from his door. 

"I can't!" I shouted back, 
charging down. 

When I got to the basement, I 
saw the open elevator door and 
the light streaming out from the 
inside. Empty. 

I looked around for a light 
switch, but there wasn't any. I 
started to move along the dark 
passage as fast as I could. 

"Hon!" I whispered urgently. 
"Ruth, where are you?" 

I found her standing before a 
doorway in the wall. It was open. 

"Now stop acting as if I were 
insane," she said coldly. 

I gaped and felt a hand pressing against my cheek. It was my 
own. 

She was right. There were 
stairs. And it was lighted down 
there. I heard sounds — sounds of 
metallic clickings and strange 
buzzings. 

I took her hand. 

"I'm sorry, baby," I said. "I'm 
very sorry." 

Her hand tightened in mine. 
"Never mind that now. There's 
something queer about all this." 

I nodded. Then I said. "Yeah," 
realizing she couldn't see my nod 

in the darkness. 

"Let's go down," she said. 

"I don't think we better,** I 
argued. 



"We've got to know," she insisted as if the entire problem had 
been assigned to her. 

"But there must be someone 
down there." 

"We'll just peek." 

She pulled me and I guess I 
felt too ashamed of myself to pull 
back. We started down. Then it 
came to me — if she was right 
about the doorway and the engines, she must be right about the 
janitor and he must really 
have . . . 

I felt a rtttle detached from 
reality. East 7th Street, I told 
myself again. An apartment house 
on East 7th Street. It's all real. 

J couldn't quite convince myself. 

We stopped at the bottom and 
just stared. 

Engines, all right. Fantastic 
engines. And, as 1 looked at them, 
their structure, it occurred to me 
what kind of engines they were. 
I'd written some science articles 
and read a lot more. 

I felt dizzy. You can't adapt 
quickly to something like that, to 
be plunged from a stone apartment house basement into this 
. . . this storehouse of energy. 

It got me. 

T DON'T know how much time 
*■ passed, but I finally realized 
we had to get out of there and 
report it. We had to do something. First of all, get out, though. 



SHIPSHAPE HOME 



"'Come on," I said. 

We moved up the steps, my 
mind working like an engine itself, fast and furious, spinning 
out ideas and theories. All of 
them crazy. All of them acceptable. Even the craziest one. 

It was when we were moving 
down the basement hall. 

We saw the janitor coming at 
us. 

It was still dark, even with, the 
little light that was coming from 
the early morning haze. I grabbed 
Ruth and we ducked behind a 
stone pillar. We stood there holdin our breaths, listening to the 
sound of his approaching shoes. 

He passed us. He was holding 
a flashlight, but he didn't play it 
around. He just moved straight 
for the open door. 

As he came into the patch of 
light from the open doorway, he 
stopped. His head was turned 
away. The guy was facing the 
stairway. 

But he was looking at us. 

It knocked out what little 
breath I had left. I just stood 
there and stared at that eye in 
the back of his head. And, although there wasn't any face 
around it, that ghastly eye had 
a smile that went with it. A nasty, 
self -certain and frightening smile. 
He saw us and he was amused 
and didn't have to do a thing 
about it. 

He went through the doorway 



and the door thudded closed behind him and the stone wall segment slid down and shut it from 
view. 

We stood there shivering. 
"You saw it," she finally said. 
"Yes." 

"He knows we saw those engines and still he didn't do anything." 

We went on talking after we 
got in the elevator. 

"Maybe there's nothing really 
wrong," I said, "Maybe . . 

Then I stdpped. I remembered 
those engines. I remembered what 
kind they were. 

"What shall we do?" she asked, 
scared. 

I put my arm around her for 
comfort. But I was scared, too. 

"We'd better get out," I said. 
"Fast." 

"Like this? Without packing?'* 

"We'll get our stuff together 
and leave before morning. I 
don't think they can do . . .** 

"They?" she interrupted. 

Why had I said that? But it 
had to be a group. The janitor couldn't have made or even assembled those engines all by himself. 

I think it was the third eye 
that cemented my theory. And "* 
when we stopped in to see Phil 
and Marge and they asked us 
what happened, I told them what 
I thought. I don't think it surprised Ruth much. She probably 



GALAXY SCIENCf FICTION 



had decided the same herself. 
What I said was: 

"I think the house is a rocket 
ship." 

Phil grinned, then stopped 
when he saw I wasn't trying to 
kid him. 

"What?" Marge asked blankly, 
not getting it at all. 

"I know it sounds crazy," I 
said, sounding more like my wife 
than she did, "but those engines 
are rocket engines. I don't know 
how they ..." I shrugged helplessly at the whole idea. "All I 
know is that they're rocket engines." 

"That doesn't mean it's a — a 
ship?" Phil finished weakly, 
switching from statement to question in mid-sentence. 

"Yes," said Ruth. 

And I shuddered. That seemed 
to settle it. She'd been right too 
often lately. 

"What*s the point?" Marge 
asked. "Why?" 

"If you figure it out," said 
Ruth, "it makes sense." 

WE all turned toward her. 
"How, baby ?" I asked, 
afraid to be asking. 

"That janitor," she said. "He's 
not a man. We know that. That 
third eye makes it a positive fact. 
I mean for sure." 

"You telling me the guy actually has one?" Phil asked incredulously. 



I nodded. "He has one," I said. 
"I saw it." 

"Oh, my God," he said. 

"He's not a man." Ruth repeated. "Humanoid, yes, but not 
from Earth. Except for the eye, 
he might look just about like us. 
But he might be completely different, so different that they'd 
change his form. Give him that 
extra eye just to keep track of us 
when we didn't know he was." 

Phil ran a shaking hand 
through his hair. "This is crazy,'" 
he said. 

He sank down into a chair. So 
did the girls. 

I didn't. I felt uneasy about 
sticking around. I thought we 
should grab our hats and run. 
They didn't seem to fee! in immediate danger. I finally decided it 
wouldn't hurt to wait until morning. Then I 'd tell Johnson or 
somebody. Nothing could happen 
right now. 

"This is crazy," Phil said again. 

"I saw those engines," I stated. 
"They're really there. You can't 
get away from that fact." 

"Listen," Ruth said, "they're 
probably extraterrestrials." 

"What are you talking about?" 
Marge demanded irritably. She 
was good and afraid, I saw. 

"Hon," I contributed weakly, 
**you've been reading too many 
science fiction magazines." 

Her lips drew together. "You 
thought I was crazy when I sus

pected this place. You thought so 
when I told you I saw those engines. You thought so when I 
told you the janitor had fehree 
eyes. Well, I was right every time. 
Now, lay off the imagination business. You need to do some guessing to explain all those things. 
Even you'll admit they don't happen every day — as far as we 
know." 

I shut up. 

"What if they're from another 
planet?" she rephrased, for 
Marge's benefit. "Suppose they 
want some Earth people to experiment on. To observe . . ." she 
amended, though I don't know 
for whose benefit. But the idea of 
being experimented on by threeeyed janitors from another planet 
had something revolting about it. 

"What better way," Ruth was 
saying, "of getting people than to 
build a rocket ship that looks 
like an apartment house, rent it 
out cheap and get it full of people 
fast?" 

She looked at us without yielding an inch. 

"And then," she said, "just wait 
until some morning, early, when 
everybody is asleep and . . . goodby, Earth." 

It was crazy, but I'd been 
shrewdly practical — and wrong — 
three times. I couldn't afford to 
doubt now. It wasn't worth, the 
risk. And I sort of felt she was 
right. 



"But the whole house?" Phil 
was saying. "How could they get 
it ... in the air?" 

"If they're from another planet, 
they're probably centuries ahead 
of us in space travel." 

Phil started to answer. He faltered. Then he said, "But it 
doesn't look like a ship." 

"The house might be a shell 
over the ship," I said. "It probably is. Maybe the ship just includes the bedrooms. That's all 
they'd need. That's where everybody would be in the early morning hours if . . ." 

"No," Ruth said. ''They 
couldn't knock off the shell without attracting too much attention." * 

We were all silent, laboring 
under a thick cloud of confusion 
and half-formed fears. Halfformed because you can't shape 
your fears of something when you 
don't even know what it is. 

"Suppose it is a building," 
Ruth said. "Suppose the ship is 
outside of it." 

Marge was practically lost. She 
got angry because she was lost. 
"There's nothing outside the 
house. That's obvious!" 

"Those people would be way 
ahead of us in science," Ruth 
said. "Maybe they've mastered 
invisibility of matter." 

We all squirmed at once, I 
tlnnk. 

"Babe," I said. 




 



"Is it possible?" Ruth challenged. 

I sighed. "It's possible. I don't 
know what is or isn't any more.'* 

We were quiet. 

"Listen," Ruth said. 

"No," I cut in. "You listen. I 
think maybe we're going overboard on this thing. But there are 
engines in the basement and the 
janitor does have three eyes. On 
the basis of that, I think we have 
enough reason to clear out. Tonight." 

We all agreed on that anyway. 

"We'd better tell everybody in 
the house," Ruth said. "We can't 
leave them here." 

"It'll take too long," Marge argued. 

"No, we have to," I said. "You 
pack, babe. I'll tell them." 

I headed for the door and grabbed the knob. 

It didn't turn. 

A BOLT of panic drove through 
me. I grabbed at it and 
yanked hard. I thought for a 
second, fighting down fear, that 
it was locked on the inside. I 
checked. 

It was locked on the outside. 

Marge was ready to scream. 
You could sense it bubbling up in 
her. 

"It's true," Ruth said, horrified. "Oh, my God, it's all true, 
then!" 

I made a dash for the window. 



The place began to vibrate, as 

if we were about to get hit by an 
earthquake. Dishes started to rattle and fall off their shelves. We 
heard a chair crash onto its side 
in the kitchen. 

"What is it?" Marge cried. 

Phil grabbed for her as she began to whimper. Ruth ran to me 
and we stood there, frozen, feeling the floor shake under our 
feet. 

"The engines!" Ruth suddenly 
screamed. "They're going now/" 

"They have to warm up!" was 
my wild guess. "We can still get 
out!" 

I let go of Ruth and grabbed a 
chair. For some reason I felt that 
the windows would be automatically locked, too. 

I hurled the chair through the 
glass. The vibrations were getting 
worse. 

"Quick !" I shouted over the 
noise. "Out on the fire escapel 
Maybe we can make it!" 

Impelled by panic and dread, 
Marge and Phil came running 
over the shaking floor. I almost 
shoved them out through the 
gaping window hole. Marge tore 
her skirt. Ruth cut her finger. I 
went last, dragged a glass dagger 
through my leg. I didn't even feel 
it, I was so keyed up. 

I kept pushing them, hurrying 
them down the fire escape steps. 
Marge caught a heel in between 
two gratings and her shoe came

off. She half limped, half fell 
down the orange-metal steps, her 
face white and twisted with fear. 
Ruth in her loafers clattered 
down behind Phil. I came last, 
shepherding them frantically. 

We heard windows crashing 
above and below. We saw an 
older couple ahead of us crawl 
out hurriedly and start down. 
They held us up. 

"Look out, will you!" Marge 
shouted at them in a fury. 

They cast a frightened glance 
over their shoulders. 

Ruth looked back at me. "Arc 
you coining?" she asked quickly, 
her voice between a sob and a 
scream. 

"I'm here," I said breathlessly. 
I felt as if I were going to collapse on the steps. 

They seemed to go on forever. 

At the bottom was a ladder. 
We saw the old lady drop from 
it and cry out in pain as her ankle 
twisted under her. Her husband 
climbed down and helped her up. 
The building was vibrating harshly now. We saw dust scaling out 
from between the bricks. 

My voice joined the throng, 
all crying the same word: 
"Harry!" 

I saw Phil drop down. He 
caught Marge, who was sobbing 
in fright. I heard her half-articulate, "Oh, thank God!" as she 
landed. They started up the alleyway. Phil looked back over 



his shoulder at us, but Marge 
dragged him on. 

"Let me go first!" I snapped 
quickly. Ruth stepped aside. I 
swung down the ladder and 
dropped, felt the sting in my insteps, a slight pain in my ankles. 
1 looked up, extended my arms. 

An old man behind Ruth was 
trying to shove her aside so he 
could jump down. 

"Look out ! " I yelled, 1 i ke a 
raging animal, reduced suddenly 
by fear and concern. If I'd had a 
gun, I'd have shot him. 

RUTH let the old man go by. 
He scrambled to his feet, 
breathing feverishly, and ran 
down the alley. The building was 
shaking and trembling. The air 
was filled with the roar of the 
engines now. 

"Ruth!" I yelled. 
She dropped and I caught her. 
We regained our balance and 
started up the alley. I could hardly breathe with that stitch in my 
side. 

As we dashed into the street, 
we saw Johnson moving through 
the ranks of scattered people, trying to herd them together. 

"Here now!" he was calling. 
"Take it easy!" 

We ran up to him. 

"Johnson!" I said, "The ship 
is . . 

"Ship?" He looked blank. 
"The house! It*s a rocket ship I (

It's . . .** The ground shook wildly. 

Johnson turned away to grab 
somebody running past. 

My breath caught. Ruth gasped, 
then threw her hands over her 
face and shrieked in horror. 

Johnson was still looking at us. 
With that third eye. The one that 
had a smile in it. 

"No!" Ruth said. "No!" 

And then the sky, which was 
growing light, grew dark. My

were screaming their lungs out in

Solid walls were blotting out

THE BEST FROM FANTASY 
AND SCIENCE FICTION. 
Edited by Anthony Boucher and 
y. Francis McComas. Little, 
Brown & Co., Boston, 1952. xiv 
-f 214 pages, $2.75 

HERE is a representative 
sampling of the backfiles of 
the fine Boucher -Mc Comas periodical. Not really a science fiction collection, since only 8 out 
of 19 of its pieces can even remotely be classed as such, the 
book is a picture of the whole 
field of fantasy — the weird, the 



supernatural, the symbolical, the 
fanciful. 

Science fiction addicts will 
like Cleve Cartmill's "Huge 
Beast,** Martin Gardner's "NoSided Professor,*' Idris Seabrighfs "The Listening Child,*' 
Alan Nelson's "Narapoia" (delightful!), Oliver LaFarge'* 
slightly leaden "John the Revelator," Winona McClintic's "In 
the Days of Our Fathers," Will 
Stanton's "Barney," and H. F. 
Heard's magnificently horrid 
"The Collector." They may sniff 
at the other stories, but people 



★ * * * * SHEIF 



14»* 



of less narrow tastes will find the 
whole collection pleasant. 

Such wholly joyful fancies 
as James Stephens' immortal 
"Threepenny Piece," Robert Arthur's "Postpaid to Paradise," 
and H. Nearing's "Mathematical 
Voodoo" prove that fantasy has 
great vigor and appeal. They 
also reveal the untenability of 
the editors' claim that fantasy 
and science fiction are almost interchangeable. I can't imagine 
■ny reader mistaking these 
whimsies for science fiction. 

The outstanding quality of 
the Boucher-McComas magazine is the high quality of its 
contents. It may not be all science fiction, friends — but much 
of it is first-rate writing. 

1M AGIN AT I ON VNLIM1 TED. Edited by Everett F. 
Bleiter and T. E. Dikty. Farrar, 
Straus and Young, Inc., New 
York, 1952. liii + 430 pages, 
$3.50 

ANOTHER "idea" collection, 
and one of the thinnest yet, 
this contains 13 stories for $3.50. 
Eight arc grade A; the other five 
average C. Not bad — but not 
good enough. 

The idea behind the anthology is that each story represents 
a science; the learned commentary with which the editors 
tie the stories to their respective 



sciences is elephantinely ponderous. I can't think of a better 
way to frighten off potential 
readers. Furthermore, to palm 
off a mere baker's dozen of 
stories as a full-edged anthology 
on the basis that it is a fair representation of the science in science fiction is not easy for the 
irascible undersigned to accept. 

We can be thankful for the 
good stories, of course. Ted Sturgeon's "What Dead Men Tell" 
represents the fanciful mathematics of topology fancily ; Ray 
Bradbury's pure fantasy "Referent" stands for philosophy — not, 
of course, a science at all. 

The physical sciences suffer: 
Of four stories, only one is memorable, and that an ancient from 
1934, Raymond Z. Gallun's overwritten but deeply felt "Old 
Faithful," about a Martian in 
communication with Earth. This 
represents astronomy. Malcolm 
Jameson's inferior "Blind Man's 
Buff" stands for geology and geography (and there are so many 
better!); Ross Rocklynne's infantile "Pressure" for chemistry; and 
Philip Latham's "The Xi Effect," 
which continues this one-stringed 
author's end-of-the-world phobia 
into ridiculousness, stands for 
physics. 

Of the stories representing the 
biological sciences, only Julian 
May's magnificently evocative 
"Dune Roller,** incongruously 



104 



• ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



representing biochemistry, stands 
out. Harry Bates' "Alas, AH 
Thinking!" previously anthologized by Phil Stong is good reading, but poor science fiction, since 
"The Time Machine" was written 
first. Paleontology is represented 
by de Camp's inconsequential 
"Employment." 

The social and psychological 
sciences do very well indeed — 
something of a commentary on 
the trend in science fiction. Grade 
A : Peter Phillips' "Dreams Are 
Sacred," Kris Neville's "Hold 
Back Tomorrow," John Berry man's very strong "Berom," and 
Frank Robinson's fine "The Fire 
and the Sword." 

DESTINA TION : UNIVERSE! 
by A. E. van Vogt. Pellegrini and 
Cudahy, New York, 1952. xv + 
295 pages, $3.00 

THE WEAPON MAKERS by 
A. E. van Vogt. Greenberg: Pubfisher, New York, 1952. 220 pages, 
$2.75 

DESTINATION: Universe! is 
van Vogt's first collection of 
novelets and short stories, and of 
all his books it shows forth most 
meaningfully the real dimensions 
of his talent. A very important 
talent it is, too. You can jibe at 
his super-impossible creations; 
you can call him fantasist and 
supernaturalist ; you can (with 
some justice) rebel against the 



coldness of his writing and the 

woodenness of his characterizations. But you will still have to 
admit, after reading the samples 
in this book from his more than 
a million words of science fiction, 
that he is one of the great seminal 
influences in the field, and has one 
of the most superb imagination! 
of all time. 

Of the ten tales, five have been 
anthologized previously, five have 
not. Those anthologized include: 
"Far Centaurus," "The Monster," 
"The Enchanted Village," "Dear 
Pen Pal," and "The Search" — 
all five Class A stories. Unanthologized tales include: "Dormant" 
(not one of my favorites), "A 
Can of Paint" (minor), "Defense" (very powerful and shocking), "The Rulers" (from one of 
his Complicated Periods), and 
"The Sound" (not tops). 

Also revealing in a pleasantly 
unassuming way is the introduction to the collection. It is • 
pleasure to read a preface that 
does not try to present a compleat 
filosofy of science fiction in one 
mushy scoopful of sententious 
blather and pseud o- omniscient 
magesterialism. 

The Weapon Makers, our second van Vogt of the month, is 
one of his largest, most effective, 
and sometimes most hollowsounding concepts. 

After all, whet can you say 
about any van Vogt book from 



★ * * * * SM BLF 



his really Big Period (roughly 
1940-1949) except that it is Star 
stuff, despite its bombast and its 
blithe impossibilities? 

Here in this book the "inventor" of the magnificent sociological concept of The Weapon 
Shops (see the first book in the 
series, The Weapon Shops of 
Isher, published by Greenberg in 
1 95 1 ) turns out to be the world's 
only immortal. As Robert Hedrock, he shepherds the Isher civilization through one of its most 
severe crises by marrying the 
Empress Innelda and at the same 
time by manipulating matters so 
that her greatest enemies, the people of the Weapon Shops, are able 
to take the secret of interstellar 
travel away from her and give it 
to the people. 

It is a fascinating book. You 
cannot put it down. But you can, 
perhaps chuckle at yourself for 
enjoying such patently incredible 
stuff! 

THE ATOM CLOCK by Cornel 
Lengyel. Fantasy Publishing Co., 
Inc., Los Angeles, 1951. 66 pages, 
paper, $1.00 

THIS is a well-intentioned but 
loose -lipped one -act play 
about a Worker's attempt to rebel 
against the Military Control of 
Atomic Energy. Written in a style 
remi niscent of the dancing of 
Mary Wigman, (i.e., it jerks and 



drools), it appears quite unrealistic, mushy and pseudo-profound, despite its obviously sincere intentions. It won a Maxwell 
Anderson Award in 1950. Why? 

FIVE ADVENTURE NOVELS 
by H. Rider Haggard. Dover 
Publications, Inc., New York, 
1952. 821 pages, $3.95 

rVNE of the year's best and biggest book buys, this monster 
omnibus contains the complete 
text of the following fine old pompous, fantastical, colorful, overblown adventure romances: She, 
King Solomon's Mines, Allan 
Quartermain, Allan's Wife, and 
Maiwa's Revenge. Pumped full of 
antique hooey though these tales 
are, and funny where they should 
not be, nevertheless I think they 
are vastly entertaining. 

No biographical or historical 
data are in the book, unfortunately ; so it will be recorded here 
that the five novels were published between 1885 {King Solomon's Mines') and 1889 {Allan's 
Wife), and that they are selected 
from a total of over 40 novels 
written from 1885 to 1925, when 
Haggard died at the age of 70. 

The five stories included in this 
collection are, of course, among 
his best-known works. They 
should occupy a place of honor 
on the shelves of any collector.

Who knows whether the strange events of this story might 
not one day occur? 

This is the story of an expedition — a strange and exciting 
expedition of one man and an army of women. 

He had come into the land of the women suddenly — and 
without warning. Tall, bronzed, muscular, he stood out 
among their pale skins and meek spirits. And when they 
learned of the land from which he had come — the land 
they hadn't even known existed — they had to follow him 
to it. 

One man and an army of women crossing the remnants of 
a post-atomic United States in search of the Unknown; it was 
an amazing trek. Miraculous things happened to the women. 
New emotions rose up to plague them. Once there was a 
near mutiny. Another time, seven of their number were killed. 
But it was when they reached the city in the sea that the 
strangest thing of all happened. . . . 

Exciting, imaginative, prophetic, THE CITY IN THE SEA is 
also something rare in science fiction — a competlingly 
human story.

PART 2 OF A 3 PART SERIAL 

A displaced person in a Utopia is worse 
off than in any other kind of society ... 
especially if he happened to help build itl 

SYNOPSIS 

Mitchell Courtenay, the nar- ditiortal marriage; the planet Verator of this story, had three nus; and the Conservationists, 
grave problems — his wife Kathy, commonly known as "Connies,"* 
who refused to finalize their con- an outlawed organization. 




largest advertising agency on 
Earth, Courtenay was dedicated 
to the highest principle of this 
completely free enterprise soctety: Sales. Only through sales, he 
held, could the economy expand 
indefinitely. Kathy bitterly wanted to know why it had to, a question i-iat, to Courtenay, was little 
short of commercial heresy. Added to this marital strain was his 
jealousy of Kathy* & liking for 
Jack O'Shea, the midget space 
pilot who was the only person to 
reach Venus thus far. 

Surprisingly, Courtenay had 
been selected by Fowler Schocken 
to head the Venus Project, a contract granted by the Incorporated 
United States of America to develop and exploit Earth's sister 
planet. He had expected Matt 
Runstead, an older executive in 
the company, to be angry and 
jealous, for Runstead had higher 
seniority and should logically 
have been chosen to handle the 
account. But Runstead evidently 
was going further than the usual 
routine attempts to discredit 
Courtenay by lying, cajoling, 
bribing his staff, spying on his 
plans — Runstead seemed to be 
actively sabotaging the project! 

That, however, could have 
been the work of the Connies, 
who fought savagely for the conservation of natural resources, 
and might be expected to combat 
the use of enormous amounts of 



metals and fuels needed to colonize and exploit Venus. 

As proof of that, there were the 
two attempts on Courtenay's life 
— once when he was in Washington to interview O'Shea, the tiny 
space pilot, and a 'copter cargo 
nacelle almost killed him; another when a gunman in a passenger 'copter tried to shoot him 
through the window of his apartment. The possibility of a commercial feud was ruled out by 
Fowler Schocken when Courtenay questioned him about it; 
there would have been court 
hearings, counter-claims, perhaps 
even injunctions, before they 
were notified of a feud. Obviously, no entrepeneur would be guilty of the high commercial crime 
of murder without notification, 
so it must have been the Connie 
crackpots. 

But then something even more 
disturbing occurred. Testing consumer reaction had always been 
the basis of successful advertising, and Courtenay had picked 
Cal-Mex to sample attitudes toward colonizing, supporting the 
gigantic project, buying Venusitin 
products, and other such essentials . . . but Runstead's staff 
sent in faked information! 

Enraged, Courtenay fired the 
entire staff there and went to the 
South Pole, where Runstead was 
"on vacation," to confront him 
with his treachery.

Courtenay found him on the 
slope of Starrzelius Glacier. But 
Runstead was ready . . . he cut 
Courtenay down with a slash of 
skis across the Polar helmet, left 
him dazed, freezing, beyond hope 
of rescue. As the fierce cold reached into Courtenay 1 s unheated 
suit, he Jiad only two thoughts. 
One was of Kathy. The other 
was of death. 

VII 

IT was a throbbing, strumming inferno, complete with 
red fire and brutish -looking 
attendant devils. It was exactly 
what I would have consigned a 
Taunton copysrnith to. I was 
confused to find myself there. 

The confusion did not last 
long. One of the attendant devils 
shook my shoulder roughly and 
said: "Gimme a hand, sleepy. I 
gotta stow my hammock." My 
head cleared and it was very 
plain that he was simply a lowerclass consumer. 

"Where's this?" I asked him. 
"Did you bring me back to the 
infirmary in Little America?" 

"Jeez, you talk funny," he 
commented. "Gimme a hand, 
will ya?" 

"Certainly not!" I told him. 
"I'm a star class copysrnith." 

He looked at me pityingly, 
said, "Punchy." and went away 
into the strumming, red -lit darkness. 



I stood up, swaying, and grabbed an elbow hurrying past from 
darkness to darkness. "Excuse 
me. Is this a hospital?** 

The man was another consumer, worse -tempered than the first. 
"Leggo my yarm !'* I did. "Ya 
want on sick call, ya wait until 
we land." 

"Land?" 

"Yah, land. Listen, punchy, 
don't ya know what ya signed up 
for?" 

"Signed up? No, I don't. But 
you're being too familiar. I'm. a 
star class copysrnith — " 

"Ah," he said wisely. "I can 
fix ya up. Justa minnit, punchy. 
I'll be right back wit' the stuff.** 

He was, too. "The stuff" was 
a little green capsule. "Only five 
hunnerd. Maybe the last one on 
board. Ya wanta touch down wit' 
the shakes? Nah! This'll straighten ya out fer landing — *' 

"Landing where?" I yelled. **I 
don't want your dope. Just tell 
me where I am and what I'm 
supposed to have signed up for 
and I'll take it from there!" 

He looked at me closely and 
said: "Ya got it bad. A hit in the 
head, maybe? Well, punchy, yer 
in the Number Six Hold of the 
Labor Freighter Thomas R. Maithus. Wind and weather, immaterial. Course, 273 degrees. Speed, 
300; destination, Costa Rica; cargo, slobs like you and me for the 
Chlorella plantations.**

"You're — ** 

"Downgraded," he said savagely, and stared at the green 
capsule in the palm of his hand. 
Abruptly he gulped it and went 
on. "I'm gonna hit the comeback 
trail, though. I'm gonna introduce new and efficient methods 
in the plantations. I'll be a foreman in a week. I'll be works manager in a month. I'll be a director 
in a year. And then I'm gonna 
buy the Cunard Line and plate 
all their rockets with solid gold. 
If -you don't like gold, I'll get 
platinum. If you don't like — " 

I inched away and he didn't 
notice. He kept babbling his hophead litany. It made me glad I'd 
never taken to the stuff. I came 
to a bulkhead and sat down hopelessly, leaning against it. I wanted to get back to New York, find 
out what kind of stunt Runstead 
had pulled and why, get back to 
K;itl)y, and my friendship with 
Jack O'Shea and my big job at 
Fowler Schocken. I had things 
to do. 

One of the red lights said 
Crash Emergency Exit. I thought 
of the hundreds of people jammed in the hold trying to crowd 
out through the door, and shuddered. 

"Excuse me, my friend," somebody said hoarsely to me. "You'd 
better move." He began to throw 
up, and apparently containers 
weren't issued aboard labor 



freighters. I rolled the emergency 

door open and slid through. 

"Well?" growled a Burns Detective Agency guard. 

"I want to see a ship's officer," 
I said. "I'm here by some mistake. My name is Mitchell 
Courtenay. I'm a copysmith with 
the Fowler Schocken Asseciates." 

"Number," he snapped. 

"16-156-187," I told htm, and 
I admit that there was a little 
pride in my voice. You can lose 
money and health and friendship, but they can't take a low 
Social Security number away 
from you . . . 

He was rolling up my sleeve, 
not roughly. The next moment I 
went spinning against the bulkhead with my head rattling from 
a ham-handed slap, "Get back 
between decks!" the guard roared. "Yer not on an excursion and 
I don't like yer funny talk!"' 

I stared incredulously at the 
pit of my elbow. The tattoo read: 
"1304-9974-1416-156-187723." My 
number was buried in it, but the 
inks matched perfectly. The 
style of lettering was very slightly off — not enough for anybody 
to notice but me. 

"Waddaya waiting for?" the 
guard demanded. "You seen yer 
number before, ain't ya?" 

"No," I said evenly, but my 
legs were quivering. I was scared 
— terribly scared. **I never saw 
this number before. It's been tat

tooed around my real number. 
I'm Courtcnay, I tell you. I 
can prove it. I'll pay you — " I 
fumbled in my pockets and found 
no money. I abruptly realized 
that I was wearing a strange and 
shabby suit of Universal apparel. 

"So pay," the guard said impassively. 

"I'll pay you later," I told him. 
**Just get me, to somebody responsible — " 

A natty young flight lieutenant 
in Panagra uniform popped into 
the narrow corridor. "What's going on here?" he asked the guard. 
"The hatchway light's still on. 
Can't you keep order between 
decks? Burns gets a fitness report from us, you know." He ignored me completely. 

"I'm sorry, Mr. Kobler," the 
guard said, saluting and coming 
to a brace. "This man seems to 
be on the stuff. He came out and 
gave me a spiel that he's a star 
class copy smith on board by 
mistake." 

"Look at my number!" I yelled at the lieutenant. 

His face wrinkled as I thrust 
my bared elbow under his nose. 

"That's a high number, fellow. 
What do you expect to prove by 
showing me that?" 

"My real number is 16-156-187. 
See? Before and after that, there's 
a different lettering style! Ifi 
been added to!" 

Holding his breath, the lieu


tenant looked very closely. He 
said : "Urrim. Just barely possible. 
Come with me." The guard 
hastened to open a corridor door 
for us. He looked scared. 

The lieutenant took me 
through a roaring confusion of 
engine rooms to the purser's hatbox-sized office. The purser was 
a sharp-faced gnome who wore 
his Panagra uniform as though 
it were a sack. 

"Show him your number," the 
lieutenant directed me, and 1 I 
did . To the purser he said: 
"What's the story on this man?" 

The purser slipped a reel into 
the reader and cranked it. "13049974-1416-156-187723." he read. 
"Groby, William George; 26; 
bachelor; broken home (father's 
desertion) child; third of five sibs; 
H-H balance, male 1; health, 2.9; 
occupational class 2 for seven 
years; 1.5 for three months; education 9; signed labor contract 
B." He looked up at the flight 
officer. "A very dull profile. Lieutenant. Is there arty special reason why I should be interested in 
this man?" 

"He claims he's a copysmith 
in here by mistake. He says somebody altered his number. And he 
speaks a little above his class." 

"A broken-home child, especially a middle sib from the low 
levels, reads and views incessantly, trying to better himself. 
But you'll notice — N

"That's enough of that," I said 
curtly to the little man. "I'm 
Mitchell Courtenay. I can buy 
you and sell you without straining my petty cash account. I'm 
in charge of the Fowler Schocken 
Associates Venus Section. I want 
you to get New York on the line 
immediately and we'll wind up 
this farce. Now jump, damn you!" 

The flight lieutenant looked 

alarmed and reached for the 
phone, but the purser smiled and 
moved it away from .his hand. 
"Mitchell Courtenay, are you?" 
He took another reel and put 
it in the viewer. "Here we are," 
he said, after a little cranking. 
The lieutenant and I looked. 

K was the front page of the 
New York Times. The first column contained the obituary of 
Mitchell Courtenay, head of 
Fowler Schocken Associates Venus Section. I had been found . 
frozen to death on Starrzelius 
Glacier near Little America. I 
bad been tampering with my 
power pack, and H had failed. I 
read on long after the lieutenant 
had lost interest. Matt Runstead 
was taking over Venus Section. 1 
was a loss to my profession. My 
wife, Dr. Nevin, had refused to be 
interviewed, Fowler Schocken was 
quoted m a ripe eulogy of me. 1 
was a personal friend of Venus 
pioneer Jack O'Shea, who had expressed shock and grief at the 
news. 



The purser said: "I picked that 
up in Capetown. Lieutenant, get 
this silly son of a bitch back between decks, will you, please?" 

The Burns guard was called in. 
He hammerlocked me all the way 
back to Number Six Hold, 
shoved me through the door into 
the red darkness so hard that I 
bounced off somebody. After the 
relatively clear air of the outside, 
the stink was horrible. 

"What did you do?" the human cushion asked amiably, 
picking himself up. 

"I tried to tell them who I am 
. . ." That wasn't going to get me 
anywhere. "What happens next?" 
I asked. 

"We land. We get quarters. 
We go to work. What contract 
are you on?" 

"Labor contract B, they said." 
He whistled. "I guess they really had you, huh?" 

"What do you mean? What's 
it all about?" 

"Oh, you were blind? Punchy? 
Too bad. B contract's five years. 
For refugees, morons and anybody else they can swindle into 
signing up. There's a conduct 
clause. I got offered the B, but I 
told them if that was the best 
they could do, I'd just go out and 
give myself up to Brinks Express. I talked them into an F 
contract — they must have needed help real bad. It's one year 
and I can buy, outside the com

pany stores and privileges like 
that." 

I held my head to keep it from 
exploding. "It can't be such a bad 
place to work," I said. "Country 
life — farming — fresh air and 
sunshine." 

"Um," said the man in an embarrassed way. "It's better, than 
chemicals, I guess. Maybe not so 
good as power-fishing. You'll 
find out soon enough." 

THERE wasn't any landingready signal. We just hit, and 
hit hard. A discharge port opened, letting in blinding tropical 
sunlight. It was agony after the 
murky hold. What swept in with 
it was not country air, but a 
gush of disinfectant aerosol. I 
untangled myself from a knot of 
cursing laborers and flowed with 
the stream toward the port. 

"Hold it, stupid!" said a hardfaced man wearing a plant-protection badge. He threw a number 
plaque on a cord around my 
neck. Everybody got one and 
lined up at a table outside the 
ship. 

It was in the shadow of the 
Chlorella plantation, a towering 
eighty-story structure like office 
"In-and-Out" baskets stacked up 
to the sky. There were mirrored 
louvers at each tier. Surrounding 
the big buildings were acres of 
eye-stabbing glare. I realized that 
these were more mirrored lou


vers to catch the Sun, bounce it 
off other mirrors inside the tiers 
and onto the photosynthesis 
tanks. It was a spectacular 
though not uncommon sight 
from the air. On the ground it 
was plain hell. 

I should have been planning, 
planning. But the, channels of my 
mind were choked by: "From the 
sun-drenched plantations of Costa Rica, tended by the deft hands 
of independent farmers with 
pride in their work, comes the 
juicy-ripe goodness of Chlorella 
Proteins . . ." I had written those 
words. 

"Keep moving!" a plant-protection man bawled. 

I shaded my eyes and shuffled 
ahead as the line moved past the 
table. 

A dark-glassed man at the 
table was asking me: "Name?" 

"Mitchell Court—" 

"That's the one I told you 
about," said the purser's voice. 

"Okay, thanks." To me: "Groby, we've had men try to bug 
out of a B contract before this, 
you know. Are you up on the

looked squarely at me. "I see you 
understand." 

I did. Cerebrin, Twenty years 
being sandpapered, strangled, 
deafened and blinded continuously, wrapped up in one five-second 
dose. I understood, all right. 

"What's y°jJT name . Groby?" 
th< man in the dark glasses asked me. 

"Groby," I said hoarsely. 

"First name? Educational level? H-H balance?** 

"I don't remember. But if 
you'll give t'lem to me on a piece 
of paper, I'll memorize them." 

I heard the purser laugh and 
say: "He'll do." 

"All right. Groby," the man in 
dark glasses said genially. "No 
harm done. Here's your profile 
and assignment. We'll make a 
scum skimmer out of you yet. 
Move on." 

I moved on. A plant protection 
man grabbed my assignment and 
bawled at me: "Skimmers that 
way." 

"That way" was under the bottom tier of the building, into 
light even more blinding, down 
a corridor between evil-smelling, 
shallow tanks, and at last through 
a door into the central pylon of 
the structure. There was a welllit loom which seemed like twilight after the triply reflected 
tropical Sun outside. 

''Skimmer?" said a man. I 



blinked and nodded at him. "I'm 
Mullane, shift assignment." He 
peered at my profile card. "We 
need a skimmer on the 67th tier 
and we need a skimmer on the 
41st tier. Your bunk's going to 
be on the 43rd tier of the pylon. 
Which would you rather work 
on? I ought to mention that we 
don't have elevators for skimmers 
and the other Class 2 people." 

"The 41st-tier job." 

"That's very sensible." He just 
stood there, with seconds ticking 
away. At last he added: "I like 
to see a sensible man act sensible." There was another long 
pause. 

"I haven't any money on me," 
I told him. 

"I'll lend you some. Just sign 
this note and we can settle up on 
payday without any fuss It's 
just a simple assignment of five 
dollars." 

I read the note and signed it. 
I had to look at my profile card 
again; I had forgotten my first 
name. Mullane briskly scrawled 
"41" and his initials on my assignment, and hurried off. 

"I'm Mrs. Honocks, the housing officer," a woman said sweetly to me. "Welcome to the 
Chlorella family, Mr. Groby. I 
hope you'll spend many happy 
years with us. Mr. Mullane told 
you this draft of crumbs — that is, 
the present group of contractees 
— will be housed on the 43rd

tier. It's my job to see that you're 
located with a congenial group of 
fellow-employees." 

Her face reminded me faintly 
of a tarantula as she went on: 
"We have one vacant bunk in 
Dorm Seven. Lots of nice, young 
men in Dorm Seven. It means so 
much to be among one's own 
kind of people — " 

I got what she was driving at 
and told her I didn't want to be 
in Dorm Seven. 

She went on brightly: "Then 
there's Dorm Twelve. It's a rather rough crowd, I'm afraid, but 
you could carry a knife or something. Shall I put you down for 
Dorm Twelve, Mr. Groby?" 

"What else have you got? And 
by the way, I wonder if you could 
lend me five dollars until payday." 

"I'll put you down for Dorm 
Ten," she said, scribbling. "And 
of course I'll lend you some money. Ten dollars? Just sign and 
thumbprint this assignment, Mr, 
Groby. Thank you." She hurried 
off in search of the next sucker. 

A red-faced fat man gripped 
my hand. "Brother, I want to 
welcome you to the ranks of the 
United Slime-Mold Protein 
Workers of Panamerica. Una/filiated, Chlorella Costa Rica Local. 
This pamphlet will explain how 
the U. S. M. P. W. P. protects 
workers in the field from the innumable petty rackets and abuses 



that useta plague the innustry. 

Yer dues are checked off automatically, but this valable pamphlet is an extra." 

"What's the worst that can 
happen to me if I don't buy it?" 

"It's a long drop to the 
ground," he explained. 

He lent me five dollars to buy 
the pamphlet. 

I DIDN'T have to climb to 
Dorm Ten on the 43rd tier; 
there was an endless cargo net 
we could grab hold of. It took 
daring to jump on and off, and 
clearance was negligible. With 
my motion-sickness, the ride was 
torture, but I made it. 

The dorm was jammed with 
about sixty bunks, three high. 
Since production went on only 
during the daylight hours, the 
hot-bed system wasn't in use. My 
bunk was all mine, twenty-four 
hours a day. Big deal. 

A sour-faced old man was 
sweeping the central aisle lackadaisically when I came in. "You 
a new crumb?" he asked, and 
looked at my ticket. "There's 
your bunk. I'm Pine. Room orderly. You know how to skim?" 

"No," I said. "Look, Mr. Pine, 
how do I make a phone call out 
of here?" 

"Dayroom." he said, jerkins 
his thumb at the room adjoining. 

There was a phone and a biggish hypnoteleset and readers 



GRAVY PLANET 



It? 



and spools and magazines. I 
ground my teeth as the cover of 
Taunton's Weekly sparkled at 
me from the rack. The phone was 
a pay phone, of course. 

1 dashed back into the dorm. 
"Mr. Pine," I said, "can you 
lend me about twenty dollars? I 
have to make a long-distance 
call." 

"Twenty-five for twenty?" 

"Sure. Anything you say." 

He scrawled out an assignment 
slip and I signed and thumbed 
it. Then he carefully counted out 
the money from his baggy pockets and handed it to me. 

I wanted to call Kathy, but 
didn't dare. She might be at her 
apartment, the hospital or in between, and I might miss her. I 
dialed the fifteen digits of the 
Fowler Schocken Associates number after I deposited a clanging 
stream of coins. I waited for the 
switchboard to say: "Fowler 
Schocken Associates, good afternoon; it's always a good afternoon for Fowler Schocken Associates and their clients. May I 
help you?" 

But that isn't what I heard. 
The phone said : "Su numero de 
prioridad, por favor? 1 " 

Priority number for long-distance calls. I didn't have one. A 
firm had to be rated over a billion and fast pay before it could 
get a long-distance priority number in four figures. So expanded 



were the world's long lines that 
an individual priority in any 
number of figures was unthinkable. Naturally, that had never 
worried me when I made longdistance calls from Fowler 
Schocken. A priority number was 
one of the little luxuries I'd have

to learn to live without. 

I hung up slowly. 

I could write to everybody — 
Kathy and Jack O'Shea and 
Fowler and Collier and Hester 
and Tildy. Leave no stone unturned. "Dear Wife (or Boss) : 
This is to advise you that your 
husband (or employee) is not 
really dead, but inexplicably a 
contract laborer for Costa Rican 
Chlorella and please drop everything and get him out. Signed, 
your loving husband (or employee), Mitchell Courtenay." 

But there was the company 
censor to think of. And cerebrin. 

I wandered blankly back into 
the dorm. The rest of the Dorm 
Ten people were beginning to 
drift in. 

"A crumb!" one of them yelled, 



sighting me. 

"Court's called to order!" another one trumpeted. 

I don't hold what followed 
against any of them. It was traditional, a break in the monotony, something they had all gone 
through themselves. In Dorm 
Seven, it would have been a 
memorably nasty experience, and 
in Dorm Twelve I might not 
have lived through it. Dorm Ten 
was just high-spirited. I paid my 
"fine" — more pay vouchers — 
and took my lumps and recited 
the blasphemous oath and then 
I was a full-fledged member. 

I didn't troop with them to the 
mess hall for dinner. I just lay 
on my bunk and wished I were 
as dead as the rest of the world 
thought I was.

SCUM-SKIMMING was not 
hard to learn. You got up at 
dawn, gulped a breakfast sliced 
not long ago from Chicken Little and washed it down with 
Cofficst, then put on your coveralls and took the cargo net up 
to your tier. In blazing noon, 
from sunrise to sunset, you 
walked slowly and every thirty 
seconds or so you spotted a 
patch at maturity, bursting with 
yummy carbohydrates. You 
scooped up the patch with your 
skimmer and slung it down the 
well, where it would be baled, 
or processed into glucose to feed 
Chicken Little, who would be 
sliced and packed to feed people 
from Bafrinland to Little America. Every hour you could drink 
from your canteen and take a 
salt tablet. Every two hours you 
could take five minutes. At sunset you turned in your coveralls 
and went to dinner — more slices 
from Chicken Little — and then 
you were on your own. 

You could talk, you could read, 
you could go into trance before 
the dayroom hypnoteleset, you 
could buy things, you could pick 
fights, you could drive yourself 
crazy thinking of what you might 
have been, or you could go to 
sleep. 

Mostly you went to sleep. 
Payday came as a surprise. I 



didn't know two weeks had 
slipped by. It left me owing 
Chlorella Proteins only eightyodd dollars and a few cents. Besides the various assignments I 
had made, there were the Employee Welfare Fund; union dues 
and installment on the initiation 
fee; withholding tax; hospitalization (but try and get it. the 
older men said); and old age 
insurance. 

One of the things I consoled 
myself with was the thought that 
when — when, I always said 
firmly — I got out, I'd be closer 
to the consumers than any ad 
man in the profession. Of course, 
at Fowler Schocken, we'd had 
our boys up from the ranks. I 
knew now that they had been 
afraid to give me the straight 
facts on consumers* lives and 
thoughts, or hadn't cared to 
admit them even to themselves. 

I learned that ads work more 
strongly on the unconscious than 
even we had thought. I was 
shocked repeatedly to hear advertising ■ referred to as "that 
bull." I was at first puzzled and 
then gratified to see it sink in and 
take effect anyway. 

The Venus-rocket response was 
naturally my greatest interest. 
For one week I listened when I 
could to enthusiasm growing 
among those men who would 
never go to Venus, who knew 
nobody who would ever go to 



120 




 



Venus. I heard the limericks we 
had launched from Fowler 
Schocken Associates chuckled 
over, with their engineered-ih 
message: that living on Venus 
increased male potency. 

Ben Winston's sub-section on 
Folkways, I had always said, was 
one of the most important talent 
groups in the whole Schocken enterprise. They were particularly 
fine on riddles: "Why do they 
call Venus the Mourning Star?" 
for instance. Well, it doesn't make 
sense in print; but the pun is 
basic humor, and the basic drive 
of the human race is sex. And 
what is more essential than to 
channel the deepest torrential 
flow of human emotion into its 
proper directions? (I am not 
apologizing for those renegades 
who talk fancifully about the 
"Death Wish" to hook their sales 
appeals to. I leave that sort of 
thing to the Tauntons of our profession; it's dirty, it's immoral, 
I want nothing to do with it. Besides, it leads to fewer consumers 
in the long run, if they'd only 
think the thing through.) 

For there is no doubt that linking a sales message to one of the 
great prime motivations of the 
human spirit does more than sell 
goods; it strengthens the motivation, helps it come to the surface, 
provides it with focus. And thus 
we are assured of the steady annual increment of consumers so 



essential to expansion. 

Chlorella, I was pleased to 
learn, took extremely good care 
of its workers' welfare in that respect. There was an adequate 
hormone component in the diet, 
and a splendid thousand-bed 
Recreation Room on the 50th 
Tier. The only stipulation the 
company made was that children 
born on the plantation were automatically indentured to Chlorella 
if either parent was still an employee on the child's tenth birthday. 

But I had no time for the 
Recreation Room. I was learning 
the ropes, studying my environment, waiting for opportunity to 
come. If opportunity didn't come 
soon, I would make one; but first 
I had to study and learn. 

Meanwhile, I kept my ears 
open for the results of the Venus 
campaign. It went beautifully — for a while. The limericks, the 
planted magazine stories, the gay 
little songs had their effect. 

Then something went sour. The 
word "Venus" drifted out of the 
small talk. When the space 
rocket was mentioned, it was in 
connection with reference points 
like "radiation poisoning," 
"taxes," "sacrifice." There was a 
new, dangerous kind of Folkways 
material — "Didja hear the one 
about the punchy that got caught 
in his spacesuit?" 

You might not have recognized 



GRAVY PLANET 



121 



what was going on, and Fowler 
Schocken, scanning his daily precis of the summary of the digests 
of the skeletonized reports of the 
abstracts of the charts of progress 
on Venus Project, would never 
have the chance to question what 
was told him. But I knew Venus 
Project and I knew what was 
happening. 

Matt Runstead had taken over. 

rpHE aristocrat of Dorm Ten 
was Herrera. After ten years 
with Chlorella, he had worked his 
way up — topographically, it was 
down — to Master Slicer. He 
worked in the great, cool vault 
underground where Chicken Little grew and was cropped by him 
and other artisans. He swung a 
sort of two-handed sword that 
carved off great slabs of the tissue, leaving it to the packers and 
trimmers and their helpers to 
weigh it, shape it, freeze it, cook 
it. flavor it, package it and ship 
it off to the area on quota for the 
day. 

He had more than a production job: he was a safety valve. 
Chicken Little grew and grew, as 
she had been growing for decades. Since she had started as a 
lump of poultry tissue, she didn't 
know any better than to grow 
and fill her concrete vault and 
keep growing, compressing her 
cells and rupturing them. As long 
as she got nutrient, she grew. 



Herrera saw to it that she grew 
round and plump, that no tissue 
got old and tough before it was 
sliced, that one side was not neglected for the other. 

With this responsibility went 
commensurate pay, and yet Herrera had not taken a wife or an 
apartment in one of the upper 
tiers of the pylon. He made trips 
that were the subject of bawdy 
debate while he was gone — and 
which were never referred to 
without careful politeness while 
he was present. He kept his twohanded slicer by him at all times, 
and often idly sleeked its edge 
with a hone. He was a man I had 
to know. He was a man with 
money — he must have money 
after ten years — and I needed it. 

The pattern of the B labor contract had become quite clear: you 
never got out of debt. Easy credit 
was part of the system, and so 
were irritants that forced you to 
exercise it. If I fell behind ten 
dollars a week, I would owe 
$1,100 to Chlorella at the end of 
my contract, and would have to 
work until the debt was wiped 
out. And while working, a new 
debt would accumulate. 

I needed Herrera's money to 
buy my way out of Chlorella and 
back to New York: Kathy, my 
wife; Venus Section, my job. 
Runstead was doing things I 
didn't like to Venus Section. And 
God alone knew what Kathy was 



122 




 



doing, under the impression that 
she was a widow. 

I tried not to think of Jack 
O'Shea and Kathy. The little 
man had been getting back at 
women for their years of contempt. Until the age of twentyfive, he had been a laughable 
sixty-pound midget, with a touch 
of grotesquerie in the fact that 
he had doggedly made himself a 
test pilot. At the age of twentysix, he found himself the world's 
foremost celebrity, the first man 
to land a ship on Venus. The 
story was that he'd been setting 
amatory records on his lecture 
tours. I didn't like the story. I 
didn't like the way he liked 
Kathy or the way Kathy liked 
him. 

AND I went through another 
day, up at dawn, breakfast, 
coveralls and goggles, cargo net, 
skimming and slinging for blazing hour after hour, dinner and 
the dayroom and, if I could manage it, a chat with Herrera. 

"Fine edge on that slicer, Gus. 
There's only two kinds of people 
in the world — the ones who don't 
take care of their tools and the 
smart ones." 

Suspicious look from under his 
Aztec brows. "Pays to do things 
right. You're the crumb, ain't 
you?" 

"Yeah. First time here. Think 
I ought to stay?" 



"You gotta stay. Contract.** 
And he went to the magazine 
rack. 

Tomorrow's another day. 

"Hello, Gus. Tired?" 

"Hi, George. Yeah, a little. Ten 
hours swinging the slicer. It gets 
you in the arms." 

"I can imagine. Skimming's 
easy, but you don't need brains 
for it." 

"Well, maybe some day you 
get upgraded. I think I'll trance 
for a while." 

And another: 

"Hi, George. How's it going?" 

"Can't complain, Gus. At least 
I'm getting a suntan." 

"You sure are. Soon you be 
dark like me. Haw-haw! You 
pass for an Indian. How'd you 
like that?" ' 

"Porque no, amigo?" 

"Hey, tu hablas espanol! Cuando aprendes la lengua?" 

"Not so fast, Gus! Just a few 
words here and there. I wish I 
knew more. Some day, when I get 
a few bucks ahead, I'm going to 
town and see the girls." 

"Oh, they all speak English, 
kind of. If you get a nice steady 
girl, it would be nice to speak a 
little Spanish. She would appreciate it. But most of them know 
'Gimme-gimme' and the English 
poem about what you get for one 
buck. Haw-haw!" 

And another day — an astonishing day.

12S 



T*D been paid again, and my 

debt increased by eight dollars. I'd tormented myself by 
wondering where the money 
went, but I knew. 

I came off shift dehydrated, as 
they wanted me to be. I got a 
squirt of Popsie from the fountain by punching my combination — twenty-five cents checked 
off my payroll. The squirt wasn't 
quite enough, so I had another — 
fifty cents. Dinner was drab, as 
usual; I couldn't face more than 
a bite or two of Chicken Little. 
Later I was hungry and there 
was the canteen where I got 
Crunchies on easy credit. The 
Crunchies kicked off withdrawal 
symptoms that could be quelled 
only by another two squirts of 
Popsie from the fountain. And 
Popsie kicked off withdrawal 
symptoms that could only be 
quelled by smoking Starr cigarettes, which made you hungry for 
Crunchies . . . 

Had Fowler Schocken thought 
of it in these terms when he organized Starrzelius Verily, the 
first spherical trust? Popsie to 
Crunchies to Starrs to Popsie? 

And you paid six per cent interest on the money advanced 
you. 

If I didn't get out soon, I never 
would. I could feel my initiative 
dying, cell by cell, within me. 
The minute dosages of alkaloid 
were sapping my will, but most 



of all it was a hopeless, trapped 
feeling that things would always 
be this way, that it wasn't too 
bad, that you could go into a 
trance or get really lit on Popsie 
or maybe try one of the green 
capsules that floated around from 
hand to hand at varying quotations; the boys would be glad to 
wait for the money. 

It had to be soon. 

u Como 'sta, Gustavo?" 

He sat down and gave me his 
A2tec grin. "Se fumar?" He extended a pack of cigarettes. 

They were Greentips. I said 
automatically : "No, thanks. I 
smoke Starrs; they're tastier." 
And automatically I lit one, of 
course. "I don't feel so happy, 
amigo." This was it. "I'm in a 
very strange situation." Wait for 
him now. 

"I figured there was something 
wrong. An intelligent fellow like 
you, a fellow who's been around. 
Maybe you can use some help?" 

Wonderful; wonderful. "You 
won't lose by it, Gus. You're 
taking a chance, but you won't 
lose by it. Here's the story — " 

"Sst! Not here!" he shushed me. 
In a lower voice he went on: "It's 
always a risk. It's always worth 
it when I see a smart young fellow wise up and begin to do 
things. Some day I make a mistake, seguro. Then they get me, 
maybe they brainburn me. What 
the hell, I can laugh at them. I 




 



done my part. Here. I don't have 
to tell you to be careful where 
you open this." 

He shook my hand and I felt 
a wad of something adhere to my 
palm. Then he strolled across the 
dayroom to the hypnoteleset, 
punched his clock number for a 
half-hour trance and slid under, 
with the rest of the viewers. 

T WENT to the washroom and 
punched my combination for 
a ten-minute occupancy of a 
booth — bang went another dime 
off my pay — and went in. The 
adhesive wad on my palm 
opened up into a single sheet of 
tissue paper which said : 

A LIFE IS IN YOUR HANDS 

This is Contact Sheet One of the 
World Conservationist Association, 
generally known as "the Connies." It 
has been passed to you by a member of 
the W.C.A. who judged that you are 
(a) intelligent; (b) disturbed by the 
present state of the world; (c) a potentially valuable addition to our 
ranks. His life is now in your hands. 
We ask you to read on "before you 
take any action. 

Facts Aboul The W.C.A. 

The W.C.A. is a secret organization 
persecuted by all the governments of 
the world. It believes that reckless exploitation of natural resources has created needless poverty and needless 
human misery. It believes that continued exploitation will mean the end 
of human life on Earth. It believes that 
this trend may be reversed if the people of the Earth can be educated to 
the point where they will demand 
planning of population, reforestation, 
soil-building, de- urbanization and an 



end to the wasteful production of 
gadgets and proprietary foods for 
which there is no natural demand. This 
educational program is being carried 
on by propaganda like this, by demonstrations of force and sabotage of factories which produce trivia. 

Falsehoods Aboul The W.C.A. 

You have probably heard that "the 
Connies" are murderers, psychotics and 
incompetent people who kill and destroy for irrational ends or out of envy. 
None of this is true. W.C.A. members 
are humane, balanced persons, many 
of them successful in the eyes of the 
world. There are irrational, unbalanced 
and criminal persons who do commit 
outrages in the name of conservation, 
either idealistically or as a shield for 
looting. The W.C.A. dissociates itself 
from such people and regards their activities with repugnance. 

What Will You Do Next? 

That is up to you. You can (a) denounce the person who passed you 
this contact sheet; (b) destroy this 
sheet and forget about it; (c) go to 
the person who passed you the sheet 
and seek further information. 

We ask you to think before you act, 

I thought — hard. I thought the 
broadside was (a) the dullest, 
lousiest piece of copysmithing I 
had ever seen in my life; (b) a 
wildly distorted version of reality; (c) a possible escape route 
for me out of Chlorella and back 
to Kathy. 

So these were the dreaded Connies! Of all the self- contradictory 
gibberish — yet it had a certain 
appeal. The ad was crafted — unconsciously, I was sure — the way 
we'd do a pharmaceutical booklet for doctors only. Calm, 
learned, we're all men of sound 



GRAVY PLANET 



125 



judgment and deep scholarship 
here. 

It was an appeal to reason, and 
that's always dangerous. You 
can't trust reason. We threw it 
out of the ad profession long ago 
and have never missed it. 

Well, there were obviously two 
ways to do it. I could go to the 
front office and put the finger on 
Herrera. I'd get a little publicity, 
maybe ; they'd listen to me, 
maybe; they would certainly believe enough of what I told them 
to check. I seemed to recall that 
denouncers of Connies were sometimes brainburned on the sensible 
grounds that they had been exposed to the virus. 

Riskier, but more heroic: I 
could bore from within, playing 
along with the Connies. If they 
were the worldwide net they 
claimed to be, I might be able to 
reach Kathy and Fowler Schocken through them — I was smart 
enough to use them without 
being used. 

HPHE door of the booth sprang 
open; my ten minutes were 
Up. I hastily flushed the contact 
sheet down the drain and went 
out into the dayroom. Herrera 
was stUl in the trance before the 
«et. 

Finally he shook himself, 
blinked and looked around. He 
saw me and his face was granite. 
I smiled and nodded, and he came 



over. "AH right, companero?" he 
asked quietly. 

"All right," I said. "Any time 
you say, Gus." 

"Always, after a thing like that, 
I plug in for some trance. I cannot stand the suspense of waiting 
to find out. Some day I come up 
out of trance and find the bulls 
are beating hell out of me, eh?" 
He began to sleek the edge of his 
sheer with the pocket hone. 
- I looked at it with new understanding. "For the bulls?" I 
asked. 

His face was shocked. "You 
have the wrong idea a little. For 
me. So I have no chance to rat." 

I hated the twisted minds that 
had done such a thing to a fine 
consumer like Gus. It was something like murder. He could have 
played his part in the world, buying and using and making work 
and profits for his brothers all 
around the globe, ever increasing 
his wants and needs, ever increasing everybody's work and profits 
in the circle of consumption, raising children to be consumers in 
turn. It hurt to see him perverted 
into a sterile zealot. 

Surely there must be some sort 
of remedial treatment for Connies like Gus who were only 
dupes. It was the people who had 
soured him on the world who 
should pay. I would ask — no, it 
would be better not to. People 
would jump to conclusions : 




 



"Once a Connie, always a Connie." "Everybody knows that. I 
don't say Mitch isn't sound, mind 
you, but — " 

The hell with Herrera. Anyone 
who sets out to turn the world 
upside down has no right to 
squawk if he gets caught in its 
gears. 

IX 

TAAYS went by like weeks. Herrera talked little to me, until, 
one evening in the dayroom, he 
suddenly asked : "You ever see 
Gallina?" That was Chicken Little. I said no. "Come on down, 
then. I can get you in. She is 
something to see." 

We walked through corridors 
and leaped for the descending 
cargo net. I resolutely shut my 
eyes. You look straight down that 
tiling and you get the high-sky 
horrors. Tier Forty, Thirty, 
Twenty, Ten, Zero, Minus Ten — 

"Jump off," Herrera said. "Below Minus Ten is the machinery." 

I jumped. 

Minus Ten was gloomy and 
sweated water from its concrete 
walls. "The roof was supported by 
immense beams. A tangle of pipes 
jammed the -corridor where we 
got off. 

"Nutrient fluid," Herrera explained. 

I asked about the apparently 
immense weight of the ceiling. 



"Concrete and lead. It shields 
cosmic rays. Sometimes a Gallina 
goes cancer." He spat. "No good 
to eat for people. You got to burn 
it all if you don't catch it real 
fast — " He swung his glittering 
slicer in a screaming arc to show 
me what he meant by "catch." 

He swung open a door. "This 
is her nest," he said proudly. I 
looked and gulped. 

It was a great concrete dome. 
Chicken Little filled most of it. 
She was a gray-brown, rubbery 
hemisphere towering over and 
away from us, as huge as a hypnomovie palace. Dozens of pipes 
ran into her. You could see that 
she was alive. 

Herrera said to me: "All day 
I walk around her. I see a part 
growing fast, it looks good and 
tender, I slice." His two-handed 
blade shaved off an inch-thick 
Chicken Little steak. "Crumbs 
behind me hook it away and cut 
it up and put it on the conveyor." 
There were tunnel openings 
spotted around the circumference 
of the dome, with idle conveyor 
belts visible in them. 

"Doesn't she grow at night?" 

"No. They turn down the nutrient just enough, they let the 
waste run off. Each night she 
almost dies. Each morning she 
comes to life like Santo Lazaro. 
But nobody ever pray before 
pobrecita jGallina, hey?" He 
whacked the rubbery thing af


GRAVY PLANET 



fectionately with the flat of his 
slice r. 

"You like her," I said inanely. 

"Sure. She does tricks for me." 
He looked around and then 
marched the circuit of the nest, 
peering into each of the tunnel 
mouths. Then he took a short 



beam from one of them and casually braced it against the door to 
the nest. It fitted against a crossbar on the door and against a 
seemingly random groove in the 
concrete floor. It would do very 
well as a lock. 

"I'll show you the trick." He 





 



took out a sort of whistle. Instead of a mouthpiece, it had an 
air tank fed by a small hand 
pump. "They call it Galton's 
whistle, but who this Galton is, 
I don't know. Watch - — and 
listen." 

He began working the pump, 




pointing the whistle purposefully 
at Chicken Little. I heard no 
sound, but I shuddered as the 
rubbery protoplasm bulged away 
from the pipe in a hemispherical 
depression. 

"Don't be scared, companero," 
he told me. "Just follow." He 
passed me a flashlight which I 
stupidly turned on. Pumping 
hard, Herrera played the soundless blast of the whistle against 
Chicken Little like a hose. She 
reacted with a bigger and bigger 
cavity that finally became an 
archway over the concrete floor' 
of the nest. Herrera walked into 
the archway, saying : "Follow." 
I did, my heart pounding frightfully. He inched forward, pumping the whistle, and the archway 
became a dome. The entrance 
into Chicken Little behind us became smaller . . . smaller . . . 

We were inside a hemispherical 
bubble moving slowly through a 
giant lump of gray-brown, rubbery flesh. "Light on the floor," 
he said, and I flashed it there. 
The concrete was marked with 
lines that looked accidental, but 
which guided Herrera's feet. 

After endless inch - by - inch 
progress, I flashed my light on a 
crescent of metal. Herrera piped 
the bubble over it, and it became 
a disk. Still pumping/he stamped 
three times and it flipped open 
like a manhole. "You first." he 
said, and I dived down, not know


GRAVY P L A 



\7t 



ing or caring whether the landing 
would be hard or soft. It was 
soft, and I lay there, shuddering. 
A moment later Herrera landed 
beside me and the manhole above 
clapped shut. He stood up, 
massaging his arm. 

"Hard work," he said. "I pump 
and pump that thing and I don't 
hear it. Some day it's going to 
stop working and I won't know 
the difference until — " He grinned 
again. 

TJERRERA introduced me. 
M.M. "This is Ronnie Bowan." He 
was a short, phlegmatic consumer 
in a front-office suit. "And this 
is Arturo Denzer." Denzer was 
very young and nervous. 

The place was a well-lighted 
little office, all concrete, with air 
regenerators. There were desks 
and communication equipment. 
It was hard to believe that the 
only way to get in was barred 
by that mountain of protoplasm 
above. It was harder to believe 
that the squeak of inaudibly highfrequency sound waves could 
goad that insensate hulk into 
moving aside. 

"Pleased to have you with us. 
Grohy," Bowen said. "Herrera 
says you, have brains. We don't 
go in for a great deal of red tape, 
but I want your profile." 

I gave him Groby's profile and 
he took it down. His mouth tightened with suspicion as I told him 



the low educational level. "You 
don't talk like an uneducated 
man." 

"You know how some kids are," 
I said. "I spent my time reading 
and viewing. It's tough being 
right in the middle of a family 
of five. You aren't old enough to 
be respected and you aren't young 
enough to be the pet. ! felt kind 
of lost and I kept trying to better myself." 

"Fair enough. Now, what can 
you do?" 

"Well. I think I can write a 
better contact sheet than you 
use." 

"Indeed. What else?" 

"Well, propaganda generally. 
Things to make people feel discontented and wake them up." 

"Give me an example." 

My brain was chugging nicely. 
"Start a rumor going around that 
they've got a way of making new 
protein and you'll be able to buy 
it at a dollar a pound. Say it's 
going to be announced in three 
days. Then when the three days 
are up and there's no announcement, start a wisecrack going. 
Something like that catches on 
and it'll make them think about 
the old days favorably." 

It was easy. This wasn't the 
first time I'd turned my talent 
to backing a product I didn't 
care for personally. 

Bowen was taking it down on 
a silenced typewriter. "Good," he 




 



said. "We'll try that Why do you 
say three days?" 

I couldn't very well tell him 
that three days was the optimum 
priming period for a closed social 
circuit to be triggered with a catalytic cue-phrase, which was the 
book answer. I said instead, with 
embarrassment: "It seemed about 
right to me." 

"Well, we'll see if it works. 
Now, Groby, you're going to have 
a study period. We've got the 
classic conservationist texts, and 
you should read them. We've got 
special publications of interest to 
us which you should follow: Statistical Abstracts, Journal of 
Space Flight, Biometrika, Agricultural Bulletin and lots more. 
If you run into tough going, and 
I expect you will, ask for help. 
Eventually you should pick a 
subject to which you're attracted 
and specialize in it, with an eye 
to research. An informed conservationist is an effective conservationist." 

"Why the Journal of Space 
Flight?" I asked, with a growing 
excitement. Suddenly there 
seemed to be an answer: Runstead's sabotage, my kidnaping, 
the infinite delays and breakdowns in the project. Could the 
Connies, in their depraved, illogical minds, have decided that 
space travel was anti- survival, or 
whatever you called it? 

"Very important," said Bowen. 

GRAVY PLANET 



"You need to fenow all you can 

about it." 

"So we can louse it up?" 

"Good God, think what Venus 
means to us — an unspoiled planet, all the wealth the race needs, 
all the fields and food and raw 
materials! Use your head, man!" 

"Oh," I said, watching my theory evaporate. 

I CURLED up with the reels of 
Biometrika and every once in 
a while asked for an enplanation 
I didn't need. Biometrika was one 
of the everyday tools of a copysmith. It holds the story of population changes, IQ changes, 
death-rate and causes of death 
and all the rest of it. Almost 
every issue had good news in it 
for us — the same news that these 
Connies clucked over. Increase of 
population , was always good 
news to us. More people, more 
sales. Decrease of IQ was always 
good news to us. Less brains, 
more sales. But these eccentrically oriented fanatics couldn't 
see it that way and I had to pretend to go along with them. 

I switched to the Journal of 
Space Ffsght after a while. The 
news was bad — all bad. There 
was public apathy, sullen resistance to the shortages that the 
Venus rocket construction entailed, defeatism about planting 
a Venus colony at all, doubt that 
the colony could do anything if 

131 



it ever did get planted. 

That lousy Runsteadt 

But the worst news of all was 
on the cover of the latest issue. 
The cutline said: "Jack O'Shea 
Grins as Pretty Friend Congratulates with Kiss after President 
Awards Medal of Honor," The 
pretty friend was my wife Kathy. 

I got behind the Connie cell 
then and pushed. In three days 
there was a kind of bubbling discontent about the chow. In a 
week the consumers were saying 
things like: "I wish to hell I 
was born a hundred years ago . . . 
I wish to hell this Dorm wasn't so 
damned crowded . . . E wish to 
hell I could get out on a piece of 
land somewhere and work for 
myself." 

The cell was elated. Apparently 
1 had done more in a week than 
they had done in a year. Bowen 

— he was stationed in Personnel 

— told me: "We need a head like 
yours, Groby. You're not going 
to sweat your life away as a 
scum-skimmer. One of these days 
the assignment boss will ask you 
if you know nutrient chemistry. 
Tell him yes. I'll give you a 
quickie course in everything you 
need to know." 

It happened in another week, 
when everybody was saying 
things like: "Be nice to walk in 
a forest some day. Can y'imagine 
all those trees they useta have?" 
and : "This stinking salt-water 



*oap!" when it had never occurred to them to think of it as 
"salt-water soap." The assignment boss came up to me and 
duly said : "Groby, you know any 
nutrient chemistry?" 

"Funny you should ask." I 
told him. "I've studied it quite a 
bit. I know the sulfur-phosphorus-carbon-oxygen-hydrogen-nitrogen ratios for chlorella, and I 
know the optimum temperatures 
and stuff like that." 

Obviously this little was more 
than he knew. He grunted, 
"Yeah?" and went away, impressed. 

A week later everybody was 
telling a dirty joke about the 
Starrzelius Verily trust and I 
was transferred to an eight-hour 
job inside the pylon, reading 
gauges and twisting valves that 
controlled the nutrient flow to the 
tanks of chlorella. It was lighter 
and easier work. I spent my time 
under Chicken Little — I could 
pass through her with a Galton 
whistle almost without cringing 
— rewriting the Connies* fantastically inept Contact Sheet 
One:

to every one of those questions, please

But if you can, then you and your 
friends or family can get in on the 
ground ttoor of. . . . 

And so on. 

Bowen was worried. "You 
don't think that appeal to upperlevel IQs limits it too much, do 
you?" he asked anxiously. 

I didn't tell him that the only 
difference between that and the 
standard come-on for Class 12 
laborers was that Class 12s got 
it aurally — they couldn't read. 
I said I didn't think so. 

He nodded. "You're a naturalborn copysmith, Groby," he told 
me solemnly. "In a Conservationist America, you'd be star 
class." 

I was properly modest. 

He went on, "I can't hog you; 
I've got to pass you on to a 
higher echelon. It isn't right to 
waste your talents in a cell. I've 
forwarded a report on you — he 
gestured at the communicator — 
"and I expect you'll be requisitioned. I hate to see you go, but 
I'm pulling the strings already. 
Here's the Chlorella Purchaser's 
Handbook . . ." 

My heart.bounded. I knew that 
Ghlorella contracted for raw materials in New York City. 

"Thanks/' . I mumbled. "1 want 
to serve! wherever I can."* 



"I know you do, Groby. Uh — 
one thing before you go. This 
isn't official, George, but — well, 
I do a little writing, too. I've got 
some of my things here — 
sketches, I guess you'd call them 
— and I'd appreciate it a lot if 
you'd take them along and . . 

I finally got out with the harjdbook and only fourteen of Bowen's "sketches." They were 
churlish little scraps of writing, 
with no sale in them at all that 
I could see. Bowen assured me he 
had lots more that he and I could 
work on. 

I hit that handbook hard. 

rpWISTING valves left me freling more alive at the end of 
a day than scum -skimming, and 
Bowen made sure my Connie 
labors were as light as possible — ■ 
to f.».e me for work on his 
"sketches." The result was that, 
for the first time, I had leisure to 
explore. Herrera took me into 
town with him once, and I discovered what he did with those 
unmentioned weekends. The 
knowledge shocked and yet did 
not disgust me. If anything, it 
reminded me that the gap between the executive and consumer 
could not be bridged by anything 
as abstract and unreal as "friendship 1 ." 

Stepping out of the old-fashioned pneumatic tube into a 
Costa Rican drizzle, we stopped 



GRAVY PLANET 



133 



at a third-rate restaurant for a 
meal. 

Herrera insisted on getting us 
each a potato and being allowed 
to pay for it — "No, call it a 
celebration. You let me go on 
living after I gave you the contact sheet, no? So we celebrate." 

He was brilliant through the 
meal, a fountain of conversation 
and bilingual badinage with me 
and the waiters. The sparkle in 
his eye, the rapid, compulsive 
flow of speech, the easy, unnecessary laughter were like nothing 
so much as the gaiety of a young 
man on a date. I remembered my 
first meeting with Kathy, that 
long afternoon at Central Park, 
strolling hand in hand down the 
dim-lit corridors, the dance hall, 
the eternal hour we stood outside 
her door . . . 

Herrera reached over and 
pounded me on the shoulder, and 
I saw that he and the waiter were 
laughing. I laughed, too, defensively, and their laughter doubled; evidently the joke had been 
©n me. 

"Never mind," said Herrera, 
sobering; "we go now. You will 
like what I have for us to do in 
back, I think." 

He paid the check and we 
threaded our way between the 
counters, the waiter leading the 
way. He opened a door and hissed something rapid in Spanish 
to Herrera. 



"Oh, don't worry," Herrera 
told him. "We will not be long." 

"In back" turned out to be — a 
library. 

I was conscious of Herrera's 
eyes on me, and I don't think I 
showed any of what I felt. I even 
stayed with him for an hour or 
so, while he devoured a wormy 
copy of something called Moby 
Dick and I glanced through half 
a dozen ancient magazines. Some 
of those remembered classics 
went a long way toward easing 
my conscience — there was actually an early "Do You Make 
These Common Mistakes in 
English?" and a "Not a Cough 
in a Carload" that would have 
looked fine on the wall of my office, back in Schocken Tower. 
But I could not relax in the presence of so many books without a 
word of advertising in any of 
them. I am not a prude about 
solitary pleasures when they 
serve a useful purpose, but my 
tolerance has limits. 

Herrera knew, I think, that I 
lied when I told him I had a 
headache. 

Much later, he came stumbling 
into the Dorm and I turned my 
head away. We scarcely spoke 
after that. 

A week later, after a near-riot 
sparked by a rumor that the 
yeast fritters were adulterated 
with sawdust, I was summoned 
to the front office. 




 



A veep for Personnel saw me 
after I had waited an hour. 
"Groby?" 

"Yes, Mr. Milo." 

"Remarkable record you've 
made. Quite remarkable. I see 
your efficiency rating is straight 
fours." 

That was Bowen's work. He 
kept records. He had taken five 
years to worm himself into that 
very spot. "Thank you, Mr. 
Milo." 

"Welcome, I'm sure. We, uh, 
happen to have a vacancy approaching. One of our people up 
North. I see his work is falling 
off badly." 

Not his work — the ghost of 
his work, the shadow on paper 
carefully outlined and filled in 
by Bowen. I began to appreciate 
the disproportionate power that 
Connies could wield. 

"Do you happen to have any 
interest in purchasing, Groby?" 

"Strange that, you sensed it, 
Mr. Milo," I said evenly. "I've 
always had a feel for purchasing. 
.Read everything I could find on 
the subject." 

He began firing questions and I 
respectfully regurgitated answers 
from the Chlorella manual. He 
had memorized it twenty- odd 
years ago and I had memorized 
it only a week ago, so he was no 
match for me. After an hour he 
was convinced that George 
Groby was the very man needed 



for Chlorella Protein. 1 
That night I told the cell about 

.it. 

"It means New York," Bowen 
said positively. I couldn't keep 
back a great sigh. Kathy! 

He went on unaware: "I've 
got to issue you some — equipment. Look into my mouth." 

I peered in. Good fillings, a 
passable bridge and nothing else 
as far as I could see. I told him 
so. 

Bowen grinned. "By popping 
my lower jaw out and biting 
down hard, I can kill myself in 
a fifth of a second. One of those 
fillings is a shell that contains 
pure nicotine. You're going to get 
one like it." 

"The hell I am!" I started to 
say, and then shut up. The game 
was risky enough. 

"Our records," he said, taking 
a kit from a desk drawer, "contain,, only a single case of the filling being accidentally perforated. It never could happen again 
in a million years. You have 
nothing to worry about. Open 
your mouth, please." 

I opened. 

"Bite, please." 

I bit. 

"There!" 

"Done?" I muttered, curiously 
reluctant to close my mouth. 

"All done," he said. "Let me. 
see you bite. Harder . . . harder 
. . . harder. That's it!" He touched 



GRAVY PLANET 



IJ5 



a molar with a tweezer. "That's 
the one. You just bite down on 
it if captured. And for God's sake, 
have one of us remove it temporarily before you go to the dentist." 

"I'll do that," I said faintly. 

"Now," he said, "the recognition signals." 

There was a hand sign for 
short range, a grand hailing sign 
of distress for medium range. For 
long range there was a newspaper-ad code; quite a good one. 
He made me practice the sig^ns 
and memorize the code until the 
small hours of the morning. 
When we left through Chicken 
Little, I realized that I hadn't 
seen Herrera all day. I asked as 
we emerged what had happened. 

"He broke," Bowen said blunt
ly
I didn't say anything. A kind 
of shorthand talk among Connies, it meant : "Herrera toiled for 
years and years in the cause of 
the W. C. A. He gave up his 
nickels and dimes and the few 
pleasures they could buy him. 
He didn't marry and he didn't 
sleep with women because it 
would have imperiled security. 
He became possessed by doubts 
so secret that he didn't admit 
them to himself or us. The doubts 
and fears mounted. He was torn 
too many ways and he died." 

"Don't brood about it," Bowen 
said. "You're going North. 



You've got a job to do.™ 
I did. A big job.

T WENT to New York City aU 
most respectably, in a cheap 
front-office suit, aboard a tourist 
rocket, steerage class. Above me 
the respectable Costa Rican consumers oohed and ahed at the 
view from the prism windows or 
anxiously counted their few bills, 
wondering how far they'd go in 
the pleasures for sale by the colossus of the North. 

Below decks we were a shabbier, tougher gang, yet it was no 
labor freighter. We had no windows, but we had lights and 
vending machines and buckets. 

A plant protection man had 
made a little speech to us before 
we loaded: "You crumbs are going North, out of Costa Rican 
jurisdiction. You're going to better jobs. But don't forget that 
they are jobs. You're in hock to 
Chlorella. and Chlorella's claim 
on you is a prior lien. If any dtf 
you think you can disappear or 
break your contract, you're going to find out just how fast

Everything was clear. "All right,

low, we sat and waited while the 
consumers on tourist deck filed 
out. carrying "their baggage kits. 
Then we sat and waited while 
Food Customs inspectors, wearing the red-and-white A & P 
armbands, argued vociferously 
with our stewards over the surplus rations — one man had died 
on the trip, and the stewards, of 
course, held out his Chicken Little cutlets to sell in the open 
market. 

Finally the order came to fall 
out in fifties. We lined up and 
had our wrists stamped with our 
entry permits, marched by 
squads to the subway, and entrained for the city. I had a bit 
of luck — my group drew a 
freight compartment. 

At the Labor Exchange we 
were sorted out and tagged for 
our respective assignments. There 
was a bit of a scare when it 
came out that Chlorella had sold 
the contracts on twenty of us to 
I. G. Farben — nobody wants to 
work in the uranium mines — but 
I wasn't worried. 

The man next to me stared 
moodily as the guards cut out 
the unlucky twenty and herded 
them off. "It's a crime. Don't you 
think so. Mac? It violates the 
essential dignity of labor, what 
I call." 

I gave htm an angry glare. The 
man was a Connie, pure and 
simple. Then I remembered that 



I was a Connie, too. for the time 
being. I considered the use of the 
handclasp and decided against 
it. He would be worth remembering if I needed help; but if I revealed myself prematurely, he 
might call on me. 

We moved on to the Chlorella 
depot in Nyack suburbs. 

WASTE not, want not. Under 
New York, as under every 
city in the world, the sewage 
drains led to a scries of settling 
basins and traps. Every citizen 
knows how the organic waste of 
twenty-three million persons 
came waterborne through the venous tracery of the city's drains; 
how the salts were neutralized 
through ion-exchange, the chemically rich liquid piped to the 
kelp farms in Long Island Sound, 
the sludge that remained pumped 
into tank barges for shipment to 
Chlorella. I knew about it, but 
I had never seen or smelled it. 

My title was Procurement Expeditor, Class Nine. My job was 
coupling the flexible hoses that 
handled the sludge. After the first 
day, I shot a week's pay of sootextractor plugs for my nostrils; 
they didn't filter out all the odor, 
but they made it possible to live 
in it. 

On the third day I came off 
the shift and hit the showers. I 
had figured it out in advance: 
After six hours at the tanks 



GRAVY PLANET 



137 



where there were no vending machines for the simple reason that 
no one could conceivably eat, 
drink or smoke anything in that 
atmosphere, the pent-up cravings of the crew kept them on the 
Popsie-Crunchie- Starrs cycle for 
half an hour before the first man 
even thought of a shower. 

By sternly repressing the 
craving, weaker in me than in 
most because it had had less 
time to become established, I 
managed to have the showers almost alone. When the mob arrived, / hit the vending machines. 
It was a simple application of intelligence, and if that doesn't 
bear out the essential difference 
between consumer and star class 
mentality, what does? Of course, 
as I say, the habits weren't as 
strong in me. 

There was one other man in 
the shower, but, with only two 
of us, we hardly touched. He 
handed me the soap as I came 
in; I lathered and let the water 
roar down over me under the 
full pressure of the recirculators. 
I was hardly aware he was there. 

As I passed the soap back to 
him, though, I felt his third finger 
touch my wrist, the index finger 
circle around the base of my 
thumb. 

"Oh," I said stupidly, and returned the handclasp. '"Are you 
my contact — " 

"Ssh!" He gestured at the Mu


zak spy-mike dangling from the 
ceiling. He turned his back on 
me and meticulously soaped himself again. 

When he returned the soap, a 
scrap of paper clung to it. In the 
locker room I squeezed it dry, 
spread it out. It read: "Tonight 
is pass night. Go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Classics 
Room. Be in front of the Maidenform Exhibit at exactly five minutes before closing time." 

I joined the queue at the supervisor's desk as soon as I was 
dressed. In less than half an hour, 
I had a stamped pass authorizing me to skip bedcheck for the 
night. I caught the shuttle down 
to Bronxville, transferred to a 
north-bound local, rode one station, switched to the south-bound 
side and got out at Schocken 
Tower. No one appeared to be 
following me. I hadn't expected 
anyone to, but it never pays to 
take chances. 

My Connie rendezvous at the 
Met was almost four hours off. I 
stood around in the lobby until 
a cop, contemptously eying my 
cheap clothing, moved toward 
me. I had hoped Hester or perhaps even Fowler Schocken himself might come through. No 
such luck. I saw a good many 
faces I recognized, of course, but

zelius Glacier. I had no intention 
of telling just anybody that I was 
still alive. 

The Pinkerton said, "You want 
to give the Schocken people your 
business, crumb? You got a big 
account for them, maybe?" 

"Sorry," I said, and headed for 
the street door. It didn't figure 
that he would bother to follow me 
through the crowd in the lobby; 
he didn't. 

I dodged around the recreation 
room, where a group of consumers were watching a PregNot love 
story on the screen and getting 
their samples of Cofhest. and 
ducked into the service elevators. 

"Eightieth," I said to the operator, and at once realized I 
had blundered. 

The operator's voice said 
sharply through the speaker 
grille: "Service elevators go only 
to the seventieth floor, you in 
Car Five. What do you want?" 

"Messenger," I lied miserably. 
"I got to make a pickup from Mr. 
Schocken's office. I told them I 
wouldn't be let into Mr. Schocken's office, a fellow like me. I 
told them, 'Look, he's probably 
got twenny-Rve seckatarieS I got 
to go through before they let me 
see him.' I said — " 

"The mail room is on fortyfive," the operator said, a shade 
less sharply. "Stand in front of 
the door so I can see you." 

I moved into range of the TV 



ike. I had never been in the 
elevator operators' room, a thousand feet below me, where they 
pushed the buttons that triggered 
the relays that sent the cars up 
and down the toothed shafts; but 
I would have given a year's pay 
to have been able to look into it 
then. 

I stood there for half a minute. 
Then the operator's voice said 
noncommittally. "All right, you. 
Back in the car. Forty-fifth floor, 
first slide to the left." 

The others in the car stared at 
me through an incurious haze of 
Coffiest's alkaloids until I got 
out. I stepped on the leftbound 
slidewalk and went past the door 
marked "Mail Room" to the corridor juncture where my slidewalk dipped down around its 
roller. It took me a little while 
to find the stairway, but that was 
all right. I needed the time to 
catch up on my swearing. I 
didn't dare use the elevators 
again. 

Have you ever climbed thirtyfive flights of stairs?

known at all well; my luck was 
running strong.

But not strong enough. Fowler 
Schocken's office was locked. 

I ducked into the office of his 
secretary 3, which was deserted, 
and thought things over. Fowler 
usually played a few holes of 
golf at the country club after 
Work. It was pretty late for him 
still to be there, but I thought I 
might as well take the chance — though it was four more nights 
to the club. 

I made it standing up. The 
country club was a handsome 
layout, which was only fair because the dues were handsome, 



too. Besides the golf links, the 
tennis court and other sports facilities, the whole north end of 
the room was woods — more 
than a dozen beautifully simulated trees — and at least twenty 
recreation booths for reading, 
watching movies or any other 
spectator pleasure.

A mixed foursome was playing 
golf. I moved close to their seats 
as unobtrusively as possible. 
They were intent on their dials 
and buttons, guiding their players along the twelfth hole fairway. I read their scores from the 
telltale with a sinking heart: all 
were in the high nineties. Duffers. 
Fowler Schocken averaged under 
eighty for the course and couldn't 
be in a group like that. As I 
came close, I saw that both the 
men were strangers to me. 

I ' hesitated before retreating, 
trying to decide what to do next. 




CIA VY PlANfT 



Schocken wasn't in sight anywhere in the club. Conceivably 
he was in one of the recreation 
booths, but I could scarcely dare 
open the doors of all of them to 
see. 

One of the girts had just sunk 
a four-inch putt to finish the 
hole. Smiling happily as the 
others complimented her, she 
leaned forward to pull the lever 
that brought the puppet players 
back to the tee and changed the 
layout to the dogleg of the thirteenth hole, and I caught a 
glimpse of her face. It was Hester, 
my secretary. 

I couldn't guess how Hester 
came to be in the country club, 
but I knew everything else there 
was to know about Hester. I retreated to an alcove near the entrance to the ladies' room. It was 
only about ten minutes wait before Hester showed up. 

She fainted, of course. 

SWEARING. I carried her into 
the alcove. There was a 
couch; I put her on it. There was 
a door; I closed it. 

She blinked up at me as consciousness came back. "Mitch," 
she choked. "You can't be. 
You're dead." 

"I am not dead," I told her. 
"Somebody else died and they 
switched bodies. I don't know 
who 'they' are. Yes, it's realty 
me. Mitch Courtenay, your boss. 

141 



I can prove it. For instance, remember last year's Christmas 
party, when you were so worried 
about — " 

"Never mind," she said hastily. 
"My God, Mitch — I mean Mr. 
Courtenay — " 

"Mitch is, good enough, I'm 

alive, all right, but I'm in a kind 
of peculiar mess. I've got to get 
in touch with Fowler Schocken. 
Can you fix it right away?" 

She swallowed and reached for 
a cigarette. Recovering, I automatically took out a Starr. 

"Mr. Schocken's on the Moon. 
It's a big secret, but I guess I can 
tell you. It's something to do with 
the Venus project. After you got 
killed — well, you know what I 
mean — after that, when he put 
Mr. Runstead on the project and 
it began to slip, he decided to 
take matters into his own hands. 
I gave him all your notes. One 
of them said something about the 
Moon, I guess. Anyway, he took 
off a couple of days ago." 

"Who'd he leave in charge 
here? Harvey Bruner? Can you 
reach — " 

Hester was shaking her head. 
"Mr. Schocken switched in such 
a hurry, there wasn't anyone to 
spare to take over his job except 
Mr. Runstead. But I can call 
him right away." 

"No!" I looked at my watch 
and groaned. I would have just 
about time to make it to the Met. 



"I've got to leave. Don't say anything to anybody, will you? 1*11 
figure something out and call 
you. Let's see, when I call I'll 
say I'm — what's the name of 
that doctor of your mother's? — 
Dr. Gallant. And I'll arrange to 
meet you and tell you what we're 
going to do. I can count on you, 
Hester, can't I?" 

"Sure, Mitch," she said breathlessly. 

"Fine. Now you'll have to convoy me down in the elevator. I 
haven't got time to walk and 
there'll be trouble if a guy like 
me gets caught on the club floor." 
I stopped and looked her over. 
"Speaking of which, what in the 
world are you doing here?" 

Hester blushed. "After you 
were gone, there weren't any 
other secretarial jobs. The rest 
of the executives had their girls 
and I just couldn't be a consumer 
again, Mitch, not with the bills 
and all. And — well, there was 
this opening up here, you see." 

I hope nothing showed on my 
face; God knows I tried. Damn 
you to hell, Runstead, I said to 
myself, thinking of Hester's mother and Hester's young man 
that she'd maybe been going to 
marry some day, and a man like 
Runstead wrecking executives' 
lives like mine and staff lives 
like Hester's and dragging them 
down to the level of consumers. 

"Don't worry, Hester," I said 



142 




 



gently. "I'll make everything up 
to you." 

I knew how to do it, too. 
Quite a lot of the girls on the ZZ 
contract managed to avoid the 
automatic renewal and downgrading. It would cost a lot for 
me to buy out her Contract before 
the year -was up, so that was out 
of the question: but some of the 
girls did pretty well with single 
executives after their first year. 
And I was important enough so 
that if I made a suggestion to 
some branch head or bureau 
chief, he would not be likely to 
ignore it, or even to treat her 
badly. 

I don't approve of sentiment in 
business matters, but this was a 
special situation. 

TFESTER insisted on loaning 
me some money, so I made 
it to the Met with time to spare 
by taking a pedicab. Even 
though I had paid the driver in 
advance, he could not refrain 
from making a nasty comment 
about high -living consumers as 
I got out. 

I have always had a fondness 
for the Met. I don't go for religion — partly, I suppose, because 
it's a Taunton account — but 
there is a grave, ennobling air 
about the grand old masterpieces 
in the Met that gives me a feeling of peace and reverence. I 
spent my few spare minutes 



standing silently before the bust 
of G. Washington Hill, and I felt 
more self-assured than I had 
since that first afternoon at the 
South Pole. 

At precisely five minutes before midnight, I was standing 
before the big, late-period Maidenform — number 35 in the catalogue: "I Dreamed I went 
Ice-Fishing in My Maidenform 
Bra"— when I became conscious 
of someone whistling in the corridor behind me. The notes were 
irrelevant: the cadence formed 
one of the recognition signals I'd 
learned in the cell room under 
Chicken Little. 

One of the guards was strolling away. She looked over her 
shoulder at me and smiled. 

To all external appearances, it 
was a casual pickup. We linked 
arms, and I felt the coded pressure of her fingers on my wrist: 

D-O-IT-T T-A-L-K. W-H-E-N I 
L-E-A-V-E Y-O-U C-0 T-O T-H-E 
B-A-C-K 0-F T-H-E R-O-O-M 
S-I-T D-O-W-N A-N-D W-A-I-T 

I nodded. She took me to a 
plastic-finished door, pushed it 
open, pointed inside. I went in 
alone. 

There were ten or fifteen consumers sitting in straight-back 
chairs, facing an elderly consumer with a lectorial goatee. I 
found a seat in the back of the 
room and sat in it. No one paid 
any particular attention to me. 



GRAVY PLANET 



The lecturer was covering the 
high spots of some particularly 
boring pre- commercial period. I 
listened with half my mind, trying to catch some point of similarity in the varying types 
around me. All were Connies, I 
was reasonably sure — else why 
would I be here? But the basic 
stigmata, the surface mark of 
the lurking fanatic inside that 
should have been apparent, escaped rne. They were all consumers, with the pinched look 
that soyaburgers and Yeasties inevitably give; but I could have 
passed any of them in the street 
without a second glance. Yet 
this was New York, and Bowen 
had spoken of it as though the 
Connies I'd meet here were pretty high up in the scale. 

That was a consideration, too. 
When I got out of this mess — 
when I got through to Fowler 
Schocken and cleared my status 
— I might be in a position to 
break up this whole filthy conspiracy. I looked over the persons in the room a little more 
attentively, memorizing their features. I didn't want to fail to recognize them, next time we came 
in contact. 

There must have been some 
sort of signal, but I missed it. 
The lecturer stopped almost in 
mid- sentence, and a plump little 
man in a goatee from the first 
row stood up. 



"All right," he said in an ordinary tone, "we're all present and 
there's no sense wasting any more 
time. We're against waste; that's 
why we're here. For the purpose 
of this meeting, we'll use numbers. You can call me 'One,' you 
'Two' — " he pointed to the man 
in the next seat — "and so on by 
rows to the back of the room. 
All clear? 

"Now listen closely. This is 
world operational headquarters, 
right here in New York; you can't 
go any higher. Each of you was 
picked for some special quality — 
you know what they are. You'll 
all get assignments tonight. But 
before you do, I want to point 
out one thing. You don't know 
me and I don't know you; every 
one of you got a big buildup from 
your last cells, but sometimes 
the men in the field get a little too 
enthusiastic. If they were wrong 
about you . . . Well, you understand these things, eh?" 

There was a general nod. I 
nodded, too, but I paid particular attention to memorizing that 
little goatee. One by one, numbers 
were called, and the newjohns 
got up, conferred briefly with the 
goatee, and left, in couples and 
threes, for unannounced destinations. I was almost the last to be 
called. Only a very young girl 
with orange hair and a cast in 
her eye was still in the room. 

"Okay, you two," said the man 



144 




 



with the goatee. "You are going 
to be a team, so you might as 
well know names. Groby, meet 
Corwin. Groby's a kind of copysmith. Celia's an artist." 

"Right," she said, lighting a 
Starr. A perfert consumer type, 
if only she hadn't been corrupted 
by these zealots: I noticed her 
jaws working on Hi-Kick Gum 
even while she smoked. 

"We'll get along fine," I said 
approvingly. 

"You sure will," said the man 
in the goatee. "You have to. In 
order to give you a chance to 
show what you can do, we'll have 
to let you know a lot of stuff that 
we don't want to read in the 
morning paper. If you don't 
work out for us, you see the fix 
we'll be in." He tapped a little 
bottle of colorless fluid on the 
desk top. The tinny rattle of the 
aluminum top was no tinnier 
than my voice as I said, "Yes, 
sir," because I knew what little 
bottles of colorless fluid could be 
assumed to contain. 

It turned out, though, that it 
wasn't much of a problem. I 
spent three difficult hours in that 
little room, then pointed out that 
if I didn't get back to barracks 
I. would miss the morning work 
call and there would be hell to 
pay. So they excused me. 

But I missed work call anyhow, t came out of the Museum 
into a perfect spring dawn, feel


ing, all in all, pretty content with 
life. A figure loomed out of the 
smog and peered into my face. I 
recognized the sneering face of 
the solo taxi-pusher who had 
brought me to the Museum. He 
said briskly, "Hel-lo, Mr. Courtenay," and then the obelisk from 
behind the Museum, or something 
very much like it. smacked me 
across the back of the neck.

"TS he ready for Hedy?" I heard 
somebody say. 

"Good God. no!" 

"I was only asking." 

"You ought to know better. 
First you give the amphetamine, 
plasma, maybe a niacin megaunit. Then they're ready for 
Hedy. She doesn't like it if they 
keep blacking out. She sulks." 

Nervous laugh with a chill in 

it. 

I opened my eyes and felt secure and grateful. For what I 
could see was a cerebral-gray 
ceiling, the shade you find only 
in the brain room of an advertising agency. I was safe in the arms 
of Fowler Schocken Associates — • 
or was I? I didn't recognize the 
face that leaned over me. 

"Why so pleased?" the face inquired nastily. "Don't you know 
where you are?" 

After that it was easy to guess. 
"Taunton's?" I croaked. 



GRAVY PLANET 



MS 



"That is correct." 

I tried my arms and legs and 
found they didn't respond. I 
couldn't tell whether it was drugs 
or a plasticocoon. "Look," I said 
steadily, "I don't know what you 
people think you're doing, but I 
advise you to stop it. Apparently 
this is a kidnaping for business 
purposes. You people are either 
going to let me go or kill me. If 
you kill me without a declaration, 
you'll get the cerebrin, so of 
course you're going to let me go 
eventually. I suggest you do it 
now." 

"Kill you. Courtenay?" asked 
the face with mocking wonder. 
"How would we do that? You're 
dead already. Everybody knows 
that. You died on Starrzelius 
Glacier; don't you remember?" 

I struggled again, without results. "They'll brainburn you," I 
said. "Are you people crazy? 
Who wants to be brainburned?" 

The face said nonchalantly: 
"You'd be surprised." And in an 
aside to somebody else : "Tell 
Hedy he'll be ready soon." Hands 
did something, there was a click, 
and I was helped to sit up. The 
skin-tight pulling at my joints 
showed it was a plasticocoon, 
which meant I might as well save 
my strength. 

A buzzer buzzed and I was told 
sharply : "Keep a respectful 
tongue in your head, Courtenay. 
Mr. Taunton's coming in." 



B. J. Taunton lurched in. He 
looked just the way I had always 
seen him from afar at the speaker's tables in hundreds of banquets : florid, gross, overdressed 
and drunk. 

He surveyed me, feet planted 
wide apart, swaying just a little. 
"Courtenay," he said. "Too bad. 
You might have turned out to be 
something if you hadn't cast your 
lot with that swindler Schocken. 
Too bad." 

He was drunk, he was a disgrace to the profession, but I 
couldn't keep my respect for an 
entrepreneur out of my voice. 
"Sir," I said, "there must be 
some misunderstanding. There's 
been no provocation of Taunton 
Associates to commit commercial 
murder — has there?" 

"Not what the law considers 
provocation. All Schocken did 
was steal my groundwork, take 
over my senators, suborn my 
committee witnesses and steal 
Venus from me!" His voice rose. 

"No, no provocation. He's carefully refrained from killing any 
of my people. Shrewd Schocken; 
ethical Schocken !" 

His glassy eyes glared at me. 
"Of all the low-down, lousy, unethical, cheap- jack stunts ever 
pulled on me, yours was the rottenest." He thumped his chest, 
briefly threatening his balance. 
"/ figured out a way to. commit a

you played possum like a scared 
rat. You ran like a rabbit, you 
dog." 

"Sir," I said desperately. "I 
don't know what you're driving 
at." His years of boozing. I 
thought, had finally caught up 
with him. No sober ad man could 
have mixed his similes so unconsciously. 

He sat down; one of his men 
darted in and there was a chair 
seat to meet his broad rump in 
the nick of time. With an expansive gesture, B. J. Taunton 
said to me: "Courtenay, I am essentially an artist." 

The words popped out of me 
automatically: "Of course, Mr. 
— " I almost said "Schocken." 
It was a well -conditioned reflex. 
"Of course, Mr. Taunton." 

"A dreamer of dreams; a weaver of visions." I seemed to see 
Fowler Schocken sitting there instead of his rival, the man who 
stood against everything that 
Fowler* Schocken stood for. "I 
wanted Venus, Courtenay, and I 
shall have it. No rocket under 
Schocken's management is ever 
going to get off the ground, if I 
have to corrupt every one of his 
underlings and kill every one of 
his section heads. For I am essentially an artist." 

"Mr. Taunton," I said steadily, 
"you can't kill section heads as 
casually as all that. You can't 
find anybody who'll take the risk 



for you. Nobody wants to be 
brainburned." 

"I got a mechanic to drop that 
'copter pod on you, didn't I? I 
got an unemployable bum to 
plug you through your apartment 
window, didn't I? Unfortunately, 
both missed. And then you 
crossed us up with that cowardly 
run-out on the glacier." 

I didn't say anything. The 
run-out on the glacier had been 
no idea of mine. God only knew 
whose idea it had been to have 
Runstead club me, shanghai me 
and leave a substitute corpse in 
my place. 

"Tools in my hands," Taunton 
brooded. "The greatness of an 
artist is in his simplicity, his lack 
of confusion, Courtenay. You say 
to me: 'Nobody wants to be 
brainburned.' / say: 'Find somebody who wants to be brainburned and use him.' " 

"Wants to be brainburned?" I 
repeated stupidly. 

"Explai%" said Taunton to 
someone alongside him. "I want 
him thoroughly convinced." 

One of his men told me dryly: 
"It's a matter of psychological 
need, Courtenay. Ever hear of 
masochists?" 

"Sure," I said as nastily as I 
could. "Consumers who prefer 
Taunton products." 

"Worse than that . . . people 
with a deep need for physical and 
menta! punishment. In some 



GRAVY PLANET 



147 



cases, people with so great a 
feeling of guilt — and it doesn't 
matter to us whether the feeling 
is realistic or not — that only an 
agonizing death can wipe it out. 
Do you understand now?" 

I did, and it frightened me. 
"Flagellants," I whispered. "Selfimmolation. But I thought that 
with our psychiatric methods — " 

"Most of them are detected, 
treated or isolated, Courtenay. 
But not all. Our matchless research facilities here at Taunton 
have unearthed several. They are 
eager would-be suicides, only the 
suicides they would inflict on 
themselves aren't sufficiently painful. They want the exquisite agony of cerebrin. You offer that to 
them. Simple, isn't it?" 

Yes, simple . . . and as sinister 
as anything one could expect 
from Taunton. I knew from my 
research that there were consumers who defied all the principles of sales psychology. There 
was Malone, who qujetly dug 
tunnels for six years and one 
Sunday morning blew up all of 
Red Bank, New Jersey, because 
a Burns traffic cop had gotten 
him sore. Conversely, we had 
James Revere, hero of the White 
Cloud disaster, a shy, frail tourist-class steward who had returned again and again to the 
flames until he rescued 76 passengers, and died because his 
flesh had been burned from his 



bones. And there were others who 
seemingly sought destruction, 
against every instinct we built 
our great profession on — selfpreservation, self-advancement, 
gratification of the pleasure principle. It had never made sense, 
so we had dismissed these cases 
as exceptions that proved our 
rules. 

Taunton was an artist. He 
hadn't dismissed these cases; he'd 
worked out a use for them. It 
meant I was as good as dead. I'd 
never get back to the Venus project. I'd never see Kathy again. 

rpAUNTON'S blurry voice broke 
in: "You grasp the pattern? 
The big picture? The essential 
theme of it is that I'm going to 
repossess Venus. Now, beginning 
at the beginning, tell us about the 
Schocken Agency. All its little 
secrets, its little weaknesses, its 
ins and outs, its corruptible employees, its appropriations, its 
Washington contacts — " 

I was a dead man with nothing 
to lose. "No," I said. 

One of Taunton's men said 
abruptly, "He's ready for Hedy," 
got up and went out. 

"You've studied pre -history, 
Courtenay," Taunton pointed 
out. "You may recognize the 
name of Giles de Rais." I did, 
and felt a tightness over my 
scalp, like a steel helmet slowly 
shrinking. "All the generations of 



148 




 



pre-history produced only one 
Giles de Rais. Nowadays we have 
our pick of several. Out of all the 
people I might have chosen to 
faandle special work like that for 
me, I took Hedy. You'll see why." 

The door opened and a pale, 
adenoidal girl with lank blonde 
hair was standing in it. She had 
a silly grin on her face; her lips 
were thin and bloodless. In one 
hand she held a six-inch needle 
Bel in a plastic handle. 

I looked into her eyes and began screaming. I couldn't stop 
until they led her away and 
closed the door again. 

I was broken. 

Taunton leaned back comfortably and said: "Give," 

I tried, but I couldn't. My 
voice wouldn't work right and I 
couldn't remember whether my 
firm was Fowler Schocken or 
(Bchocken Fowler. 

Taunton got up at last. "We'll 
put you on ice for a while, 
Courtenay, so you can pull yourself together. I need a drink 
mys<lf." He shuddered involuntarily and then beamed again. 
"Sleep on it," he said, and left 
with a slight stagger. 

Two of his men carted me from 
the brain room, down a corridor 
and into a bare cubbyhole with a 
vi ry solid door. It seemed to be 
night in executives' country. 
Nothing was going on in any of 
the offices we passed, lights were 



low and a corridor guard was 
yawning at his desk. 

I asked unsteadily: "Will you 
take the cocoon off me? I'm going 
to be a mess if I don't get out of 
it." 

"No orders," one of them said, 
and they slammed the solid door 
and locked it. 

I flopped around the small 
floor, trying to find something 
sharp enough to break the film 
and give me an even chance of 
bursting the plastic, but there was 
nothing. After incredible contortions and a dozen jarring falls, I 
found that I could never get to 
my feet. The doorknob had offered a very faint ghost of hope, 
but it might as well have been a 
million miles away. 

Mitchell Courtenay, star class 
copysmith. Mitchell Courtenay, 
key man of the Venus Section. 
Mitchell Courtenay, destroyer-tobe of the Connies. Mitchell 
Courtenay flopping on the floor 
of a cell in the offices of the sleaziest, crookedest agency that ever 
blemished the profession, without 
any prospect except betrayal and 
— with luck — a merciful death. 
Kathy at least would never know. 
She would think I had died like 
a fool on the glacier, meddling 
with the power pack when I had 
no business to . . . 

The lock on the door rattled. 
They were coming for me. But 
when the door opened, I saw 



GRAVY PLANET 



U9 



from the floor a single pair of 
matchstick ankles, nylon-clad. 

*'I love you," said the strange, 
dead voice of a woman. "They 
said I would have to wait, but I 
couldn't." It was Hedy. She had 
her needle. 

I tried to cry for help, but my 
throat was paralyzed as she knelt 
beside me with shining eyes. The 
temperature of the room seemed 
to drop ten degrees. She clamped 
her bloodless lips on mine; they 
were like heated iron. And then 
the left side of my face and head 
were being torn off. It lasted for 
seconds and blended into a red 
haze and unconsciousness. 

"Wake up," the dead voice was 
saying. "I want you. Wake up." 
Lightning smashed at my right 
elbow and I cried out and jerked 
my arm. My arm moved — 

It moved! 

The bloodless lips descended 
on mine again, and again her 
needle ran into my jaw, probing 
exactly for the great lump of the 
trigeminal facial nerve, and finding it. I fought the red haze that 
was trying to swallow me up. My 
arm had moved — she had perforated the membrane of the 
cocoon and it could be burst. The 
needle searched again and somehow the pain was channeled to 
my right arm. In one convulsive 
jerk it was free. 

I think I took the back of her 
neck in my hand and squeezed. I 



am not sure. I do not want to be 
sure. But after five minutes she 
and her love for me did not matter. I ripped the plastic from me 
and got to my feet an inch at a 
time, moaning with stiffness. 

The corridor guard could not 
matter any more. If he had not 
come at my cries, he would never. 
I walked from the room and saw 
the guard apparently sleeping 
face -down on his desk. As I 
stood over him, I noticed a very 
little blood coagulating in the 
small valley between the two 
cords of his shrunken old neck.One thrust from Hedy transfixing 
the medulla had been enough. I 
Could testify that her knowledge 
of the nervous system's topography was complete. 

The guard wore a gun that I 
hesitated over for a moment and 
then rejected. In his pockets were 
a few dollars that would be more 
useful. I hurried on to the ladders. His desk clock said 0605. 

1KNEW already about climbing upstairs. I learned then 
about climbing downstairs. If 
your heart's in good shape, there's 
little to choose between them. It 
took me an estimated thirty minutes in my condition to get from 
executives* country onto the populated stairs below. 

The first sullen stirrings of the 
work-bound consumers were well 
under way. I passed half a dozen 



'ii N 




 



bitter fist-fights and one knife 
battle. The Taunton Building 
nightdwellers were a low, dirty 
lot who never would have been 
allowed stairspace in the Schocken Tower, but it was all to the 
good. I attracted no attention 
whatsoever in my filthy clothes 
and sporting a fresh stab wound 
in my face. Some of the bachelor 
girls whistled — pure reflex, of 
course- — but that was all. 

My timing was good. I left the 
building lobby in the very core 
of a cheek-by-jowl mob boiling 
out the door to the shuttle which 
would take them to their wretched 
jobs. I thought I saw men in 
plainclothes searching the mob 
from second-floor windows, but 
I didn't look up before I got into 
the shuttle station. 

At the change booth, I broke 
all my bills and went into the 
washroom. "Split a shower, bud?" 
a shabby woman asked me. I 
wanted one badly and by myself, 
but I didn't dare betray any 
white-collar traits. She and I 
pooled our coins for a five-minute 
salt, thirty-second fresh, with 
soap. I found that I was scrubbing my right hand over and over 
again. I found that when the cold 
Water hit the left side of my face, 
the pain was dizzying. 

After the shower, I wedged myself into the shuttle and spent 
two hours zigzagging under the 
city. My 1 a st stop was Ti mes 



Square, which now was mostly 
a freight area. While cursing consumers hurled crates of protein 
ticketed for various parts of town 
onto the belts, I tried to phone 
Kathy. There was nobody home. 

I got Hester at the Schocken 
Tower and told her: "I want you 
to raise every cent you can, borrow, clean out your savings, and 
buy a Starr2elius apparel outfit 
for me. Meet me with it soonest 
at the place where your mother 
broke her leg two years ago. The 
exact place, remember?" 

"Yes, naturally. But my contract — " 

"Don't make me beg you, Hester. Trust me. For God's sake, 
hurry. And if you get here and 
I'm in the hands of the guards, 
don't recognize me." 

I hung up and slumped in the 
phone booth until the next party 
hammered indignantly on the 
door. I walked slowly around the 
station, had Coffiest and a cheese 
sandwich and rented a morning 
paper at the newsstand. The story 
about me was a bored little item 
on page three: SOUGHT FOR 
CB & FEMICIDE. It said 
George Groby had failed to return from pass to his job with 
Chlorella and had used his free 
time to burglarize executives' 
country in the Taunton Building. He had killed a secretary 
who stumbled on him and made 
his escape.

Hester met me half an hour 
later near the loading chute from 
which a crate had once whizzed 
and broken her mother's leg. She 
looked terrified; technically, she 
was as guilty of contract breach 
as "George Groby." 

I took the garment box from 
her and asked : "Do you have 
fifteen hundred dollars left?" 

"Just about. My mother was 
frantic — " 1 

"Get us reservations on the 
next Moon ship; today if possible. Meet me back here. I'll be 
wearing the new clothes." 

"Us? The Moon?" she 
squeaked, 

"Yes, us. I've got to get off 
Earth before I'm killed. This time 
it'll be for keeps." 

XII 

IN ten hours, we were groaning 
side by side under the takeoff 
acceleration of the Moonship 
David Ricardo. She had coldbloodedly passed herself off as a 
Schocken employee on special detail to the Moon and me as 
Groby, Sales Analyst 6. Naturally the dragnet for Groby, Expediter 9, had not included the 
Astoria spaceport. Sewage workers on the lam from CB and Femicide wouldn't hop a rocket, of 
course. 

We rated a compartment and 
the max ration. The David Ri


cardo was so constructed that 
most passengers rated them. It 
wasn't a trip for the idly curious 
or the consumer fifteen -sixteenths 
of the population. The Moon was 
strictly business — mining — and a 
very little sight-seeing. Our fellow passengers, what we saw of 
them at the ramp, were preoccupied engineers, a few laborers in 
the small steerage, and silly-rich 
men and women who wanted to 
say they'd been there. 

After takeoff, Hester was hysterically gay for a while, and 
then snapped. She sobbed on my 
shoulder, frightened at the enormity of what she'd done. She'd 
been brought up in a deeply 
moral Sales-respecting home; you 
couldn't expect her to break a 
labor contract without an emotional lashback. 

"Mr. Courtenay — Mitch — if 
only I could be sure it was all 
right! I know you've always been 
good to me and I know you 
wouldn't do anything wrong, but 
I'm so scared and miserable!" 

"You be the judge, Hester. 
Taunton has found out that there 
are people who are willing to 
commit unprovoked commercial 
murder so they can be given cerebrin. He thinks Mr. Schocken 
grabbed the Venus project from 
him. He's tried twice at least to 
kill me. I thought for a while 
Mr. Runstead was one of his 
agents, assigned to wreck Schock

en's handling of the Venus account. Now, I don't know. Mr. 
Runstead clubbed me when I 
went after him at the South Pole, 
spirited me away to a labro 
freighter under a faked identity 
and left a substitute body for 
mine. 

"And." I added cautiously, 
"there are Connies involved in 
it." 

She uttered a small shriek. 

"I don't know how they dovetail," I said. "But I was in a 
Connie cell — " 

"Mister Courtenay!" 

"Strictly as a blind," I hastily 
explained. "I was stuck in Chlorella Costa Rica and the only way 
north seemed to be through the 
Connie network. They had a cell 
in the factory, I joined up, turned 
on the talent, and got transferred 
to New York. The rest you 
know." 

She paused for a long time and 
asked: "Are you sure it's all 
right?" 

Wishing desperately that it 
were, I firmly said: "Of course, 
Hester." 

She gave me a game smile. 
"I'll get our rations," she said, 
unsnapping herself. "You'd better stay here." 

FORTY hours out, I snarled 
at Hester: "The blasted blackmarketing steward is going too 
far! Look at this!" I held up my 



bulb of water and my ration box. 

The seal was clearly tampered 
with on both containers, and visibly there was water missing. 
"Max rations are supposed to be 
tamper- proof, but this is plain 
burglary. How do yours look?" 

"Same," she said listlessly. 
"You can't do anything about it. 
Let's not eat just yet, Mr. Courtenay." She made a marked effort 
to be vivacious. "Tennis, anyone?" 

"All right," I grumbled, and set 
up the field, borrowed from the 
ship recreation closet. 

She was better at tennis than 
I, but I took her in straight sets. 
Her coordination was way off. 
She'd stab for a right forecourt 
deep crosscourt return and like 
as not miss the button entirely— 
if she didn't send the ball into the 
net by failing to surge power with 
her left hand on the rheostat. A 
half hour of the exercise seemed 
to do both of us good. She cheered 
up and we ate our rations. 

There was little enough to do 
in our cramped quarters. Every 
eight hours she would go for our 
tagged rations, I would grumble 
about the shortage and tampering, we'd have .some tennis and 
then eat. The rest of the time 
passed somehow watching the 
ads come and go — all Schocken 
—on the walls. Well enough, I 
thought. Schocken's on the Moon 
and I won't be kept from him 



GRAVY PLANET

there. Things weren't so crowded. 
Moon to Schocken to Kathy — a 
twinge of feeling. I could have 
asked casually what Hester had 
heard about Jack O'Shea, but I 
didn't. I was afraid I might not 
like what she had heard. 

A drab service announcement 
at last interrupted the parade of 
ads: cooks to the galley (the 
David Ricardo was a British 

Ship) FOR FINAL LIQUID FEEDING. 
THIS IS H-8 AND NO FURTHER 
SOLID OR LIQUID FOOD SHOULD BE 
CONSUMED UNTIL TOUCHDOWN. 

Hester smiled and went out 
with our tray. 

As usual, it was ten minutes 
before she returned. We were getting some pull from the Moon by 
then, enough to unsettle my stomach. I burped miserably while 
watting. 

SHE came back with two Coffiest bulbs and reproached me 
gaily: "Why, Mitch, you haven't 
set up the tennis court!" 

"Didn't feel like it." I put out 
my hand -for my bulb. She didn't 
give it to me. "Well?" 

"Just one set?" she coaxed. 
"You heard me," I snapped. 
"Let's not forget who's who 
around here." I wouldn't have 
said it if it hadn't been Cofnest, 
I suppose. The Stanzelius-red 
bulb kicked things off in me — 
nagging ghosts of withdrawal 
symptoms. 



She stiffened. "I'm sorry, Mr. 
Courtenay." And then she 
clutched at her middle and threw 
up, violently, her face distorted. 
Astounded, I snapped the air regenerator switch to "Blast" and 
grabbed her. She was moaning 
with pain. 

"Hester," I said, "what is it?" 

"Don't drink it," she croaked, 
her hand kneading her belly. 
"The Coffiest. Poison. Your rations. Fve been tasting them." 
Her nails tore first the nylon of 
her midriff and then her skin as 
she clawed at the pain. 

"Send a doctor!" I was yelling 
into the compartment mike. 
"Woman's dying here!" 

The chief steward's voice answered me : "Ship's doctor'll be 
there right away, sir." 

Hester's contorted face began 
to relax, frightening me terribly. 
She said softly: "Bitch Kathy. 
Running out on you. Mitch and 
bitch. Funny. You're too good fox 
her. She wouldn't have. My life. 
Yours." There was another spasm 
across her face. "Wife versus secretary. A laugh. It always was. 
You never even kissed me — " 

I didn't get a chance to. She 
was gone while the ship's doctor 
was still hauling himself briskly 
in along the handline. His face 
fell. We towed her to the lazarette 
and he put her in a cardiac-node 
exciter that started her heart 
going again. Her chest began to 




 



rise and fall and she opened her 

eye*. 

"Where are you?" asked the 
doctor, loudly and clearly. She 
moved her head slightly and a 
pulse of hope shot through me. 

"Response?" I whispered to the 
doctor. 

"Random," he said with professional coldness. He was right. 
There were more slight headmovements and a nervous flutter 
of the eyelids, which were working independently. "Who are 
you?" brought a wrinkle between 
her eyes and a tremor of the lip, 
but no more. 

Gently enough, the doctor 
began to explain to me : "I'm 
going to turn it off. Irreversible 
clinical death has occurred. It's 
often hard for a person with emotional ties to believe — " 

I watched her eyelids flutter, 
one with a two-four beat, the 
other with a three -four beat. 
"Turn it off," I said hoarsely. 
He cut Hi* current and withdrew 
the needle. 

"There was nausea?" he asked. 
I nodded. "Her first space flight?" 
I nodded. "Abdominal pain?" I 
nodded. "No previous distress?" I 
shook my head. "History of ver*tigo?" I shrugged; I didn't know. 
He was driving at something. He 
kept asking, and the answers he 
wanted were as obvious as a magician's forced card. Allergies, 
easy bleeding, headaches, painful 

GRAVY PLAN IT 



menses — at last he said decisively: "I believe it's Fleischman's 
Disease. It stems from some derangement of function in the 
adrenocorticotrophic bodies under 
free flight, we think. It kicks off 
a chain reaction of tissue-incompatibilities which affects the cerebrospinal fluid — " 

I reached for the bulb and then 
remembered. "Have one with 
me," I said. 

He nodded and, with no stalling, drank from one of the nipples 
of a twin-valve social flask. I 
saw the level go down — Moonpull was strong enough for there 
to be a level — and saw his Adam's 
apple work. "Not too much," he 
cautioned me. "Touchdown's 
soon." 

I stalled with conversation for 
a few minutes, watching him, and 
then swallowed half a pint of 
hundred proof. I could hardly 
tow myself back to the compartment. I threw up and worked the 
air regenerator button in time to 
get most of it. 

I was fuzzily glad the stuff had 
stayed down long enough for the 
alcohol molecules to be picked 
out of the fluid and sent wandering through my body, bringing 
numbness to my limbs and forgetfulness to my brain. 

TTANGOVER, grief, fear and 
the maddening red tape of 
Moon debarkation. I must have 

1S5 



acted pretty stupid. A couple of 
times I heard the crewmen say 
to port officials something like: 
**Takc it easy on the guy. He lost 
his girl in flight." 

The line I took in the cramped 
receiving room of the endless 
questionnaires was that I didn't 
know anything about the mission. I was Groby, a 6, and the 
best thing to do would be to send 
mc to Fowler Schocken. I understood that we had been supposed 
to report to him. They poohpoohed that possibility and set 
me to wait on a bench while 
queries were sent to the Schocken 
branch in Luna City. 

T waited, watched and tried to 
■*■ think. It wasn't easy. The busy 
crowds in Receiving were made 
up of people going from one place 
to another place to do specified 
things. I didn't fit in the pattern; 
I was a sore thumb. They were 
going to get me . . . 

A tube popped and blinked 
at the desk yards away. I 
read between half closed eyes: 

S-C-H-O-C-K-E-N T-0 R-C-V-N-0

They were glancing at me from 
the desk and talking in low tones. 
In only a moment they would be 
beckoning the Burns Detective 
guards. 

I got up from the bench and 
sauntered into the crowd, with 
only one alternative left and that 
a frightening one. I made the 
casual gestures that, by their 
order and timing, constitute the 
Grand Hailing Sign of Distress 
of the Connies. 

A Burns guard shouldered his 
way through the crowd and put 
the arm on me. "Are you going 
to make trouble?" he growled. 

"No," I said thickly. "Lead the 
way." 

He gestured confidentially at 
the desk and they waved back, 
with grins. He marched me. with 
his nightstick in the small of my 
back, through the startled crowd. 
Numbly I let him take me from 
the receiving dome down a tunnel-like shopping street.

blinked and twinkled at me from 
the shopfronts as new arrivals 
shuffled up and down, gaping. 

"Hold it," growled the guard. 
We stepped in front of the Warren Astron sign. He muttered : 
"Twist the nightstick away from 
me. Hit me over the head with it. 
Fire one charge at the streetlight. 
Duck into Astron's and give him 
the grip. Good luck and try not 
to break my skull." 

"You're — you're — " I stammered. 

"Yeah. I wish I hadn't seen the 
hailing sign. This is going to cost 
me two stripes and a raise. Get 
moving." 

He surrendered the nightstick 
and I tried not to make it too 
easy or too hard when I clouted 
him. The buckshot charge 
boomed out of the stick's muzzle, 
shattered the light overhead and 
brought forth shrieks of dismay 
from the strollers. It was thunderous in the vaulted street. I 



darted through the chaste white 
Adams door of Astron's in the 
sudden darkness and blinked at 
a tall, thin man with a goatee. 

"What's the meaning of this?" 
he demanded. "I read by appointment — '* I took his arm in the 
grip. "Refuge?" he asked, abruptly, shedding a fussy professional 
manner. 

"Yes. Fast." 

He led me through his parlor 
into a small, high observatory 
with a transparent dome, a refracting telescope, Hindu star 
maps, clocks and desks. One of 
these desks he heaved at and it 
turned back on hinges. There was 
a pit and handholds. "Down you 
,go," he said. 

Down I went, into darkness. 

TT was some six feet deep and 
six by four in area. It had a 
rough, unfinished feel. A pick and 
shovel leaned against one wall, 
and a couple of buckets filled 
with Moon rock. Obviously work 
in progress. 

I inverted one of the buckets 
and sat down on it in the dark. 
After five hundred and seventysix counted pulse-beats, I sat on 
the floor, tried to brush Moon 
rock out of the way and lie down. 
I heard voices directly overhead. 
One was the primly professional 
voice of Astron. The other was 
the petulant voice of a woman. 
They seemed to be seated at the 



GRAVY PLANET 



117 



desk directly above me. 

" — really seems excessive, Doctor." 

"As Madam wishes. If you will 
excuse me, I shall return to my 
ephemeris — " 

"But, Dr. Astron, I wasn't implying — *' 

"Madam will forgive me for 
jumping to the conclusion that 
she was unwilling to grant me my 
customary honorarium. That is 
correct. Now. please, the birth 
date and hour?" 

She mumbled them, and I wondered briefly about the problem 
Astron must have with women 
who shaded their years. 

"So . . , Venus in the hours of 
Mars . . . Mercury ascendant in 
the trine . , 

"What's that?" she asked with 
shrill suspicion. "I know quite a 
bit about the Great Art and I 
never heard that before." 

Blandly: "Madam must realize 
that a Moon observatory makes 
possible many things of which 
she has never heard before. It is 
possible by Lunar observations to 
refine the Great Art to a point 
unattainable in the days when 
observations were made perforce 
through the thick and muddled 
air of Earth." 

"Of course. Please go on, Dr. 
Astron. Will I be able to look 
through your telescope and . see 
my planets?" 

"Later, Madam. So . . . Mer



cury ascendant in the trine, the 
planet of strife and chicanery, 
yet quartered with Jupiter, the 
giver of fortune, so . . ." 

The "reading" lasted perhaps 
half an hour, and there were two 
more like it that followed, and 
then there was silence. I actually 
dozed off until a voice called me. 
The desk had been heaved back 
again and Astron's head was silhouetted against the opening. 
I climbed out stiffly, 
"You're Groby," he stated. 



35* 




 



"Yes." 

"We got a report on you by 
courier aboard the Ricardo" I 
noticed that his hand was in his 
pocket. "You turn up in Chlorella, you're a natural-born copysmith, you're transferred to New 
York, you get kidnapped in front 
of the Met — in earnest or by prearrangrment — you kill a girl and 
disappear, and now you're on the 
Moon. God knows what you're 
up to. It's too much for me. A 
Central Committee member will 



be here shortly to try and figure 
you out. Is there anything you'd 
care to say? Like confessing that 
you're an agent provocateur?'* 
I said nothing. 

"Very well." Somewhere a door 
opened and closed. "That will be 
the Central Committee member.** 
And my wife Kathy walked 
into the observatory.
