MIND ALONEBy J. T. McINTOSH 

IF she had been a man, they 
would have saved themselves a lot of trouble and 
killed her. Yet they had quite a 
few reasons for doing what they 
did. 

First, the knowledge she had 
must be destroyed one way or 
another— there was no question 
of that. They couldn't afford to 
keep her prisoner anywhere on 
Murrane, so it was either death 
or this. Another reason was that 
they had a new technique and 
this was a chance to try it out. 
Another was that they liked the 
idea of being able to let her go, 
even return her to her own 
world, and nevertheless know 
that she was no danger to them. 

Another, perhaps, was that 
should it ever become necessary, 
they could reveal that they hadn't 
killed her after all. 

But behind all this was the 
fact that they were Murriners. 
Women, on the frontiers of galactic exploration, were, almost sacred. The whole attitude toward 
women was different from that 
on an overcrowded world with 
as many women as men. All this 
was irrelevant in this particular 
case; but, being Murriners, they 
still didn't want to kill a woman. 

"You can't (hide this," she told 
them vehemently. "Every human 
being, on Earth or Murrane or 
anywhere else, is bound to know 
the truth anyway in a few years. 
You should be trying to heal the 
differences between Earth and 
Murrane, not carry on this insane war!" 

"That's a point of view," one 
of the Murriners admitted. "Another is that we've a much better 
chance of getting what we want, 
on our own terms, if Earth 
doesn't have the faintest idea 
what our motivation is." 

'3ut your own people think — " 

"When did any people," the 
Murriner said gently, "ever know 
truly, exactly, why they were 
fighting a war?" 

SO THEY systematically destroyed her knowledge. The 
first thing to go, of course, was 



that little piece of knowledge — 
the true motive for the war. But 
they didn't stop there. Only one 
thing, at this point, was missing 
out of a well-ordered, well-stocked brain, and she would therefore 
soon get it back by calculation, 
observation or guess. So the next 
thing to go was her entire personal experience., All her memories of every event in her life 
were cleared away like so much 
rubble. She didn't know who she 
was or anything she had ever 
done. 

But she still knew language 
and how to read and write and 
walk and talk and think. She 
could still be identified in five 
minutes by these things. So they 
had to go, too. 

All that she had learned in 
years of life and study was removed in a few hours. But there 
was a difference between what 
was done to her personal memories and what was done to her 
general knowledge, including 
language. The memories were 
erased completely; the knowledge was merely blotted out. 
Thus when they came to teach 
her English again, she learned 
very quickly but talked quite 
differently. They taught her to 
write again, and as if to help 
them she automatically wrote 
with her left hand though she 
had always written with her 
right. Her writing was complete



 



ly different, of course. 

"Where am I? Who am I?" 
she asked often. 

At first, when she knew only 
a few words, they didn't answer. 
But when they saw she could 
understand, they told her, to 
quieten her, that she was Muriel 
Martin. 

She repeated the name hesitantly; "Muriel Martin. Mur-iel 
Mar-tin. Martin. Muriel — " .and 
then burst out suddenly : "But 
that's not my name!" 

"All right," she was told. "Call 
yourself anything you like. Do 
you know any other name?" 

She was silent. She didn't. 
They hadn't told her any other 
names. 

After that, they changed her 
physically. First they altered her 
metabolism. It was a tiny 
change, but her rather dark skin 
became much lighter, she ate 
less, she began to like foods she 
had disliked and lose her taste 
for others, and she became more 
deliberate in her movements, far 
less restless. An inch came off 
her hip measurement and two 
inches off her chest. Other 
changes were made merely for 
the sake of change. But since the 
people who worked on her were 
artists in their way, since they 
had to change in any case, since 
they were experimenting — they 
improved. They straightened the 
bones of her legs, corrected her 



stance and toughened the muscles 
of her neck and shoulders, so 
that she stood an inch and a half 
taller. It was enough. Big changes 
were completely unnecessary. 

*T1HK process, however, wasn't 
done with kindness, consideration and loving care. Since there 
had to be pain, they used it for 
conditioning. To make sure the 
conditioning was effective, they 
did nothing about quite a tot of 
pain that could have been 
avoided. 

She was conditioned against 
taking any interest in the EarthMurrane war, on one side or the 
other. Most particularly she was 
conditioned against ever coming 
back to Murrane. The latter was 
selective, since they had so much 
effective pain to play about with 
— they could afford to condition 
her to mild respect for Murrane, 
and strongly against ever coming 
back to it. There was enough 
stimulus available to hammer 
home even a complicated lesson. 

After all this, they removed 
the personal memories she had 
begun to build up again since the 
last rape of her mind, and left 
everything else alone. They tested her, and were pleased. Inside 
two weeks — it had had to be inside two weeks — they had destroyed one woman and put 
another, quite different, in her 
place. She would never remember 



MIND ALONE 



7 



her previous history, for it wasn't 
there to be remembered. 

When the job was finished, they 
drugged her to insensibility and 
took her to a small ship, a twoman vessel that could not only 
make the journey from Murrane 
to the Solar System, but could 
land almost anywhere in reasonable safety, being so small and so 
obviously harmless. 

The pilot of the ship, who 
would have to fly it without assistance farther than any such 
ship had ever been flown before, 
frowned and asked who the girl 
was to merit such consideration. 

It would be better for him not 
to know now, he was told. But he 
could ask when he came back, if 
he wished. 

He never came back. His ship, 
tiny as it was, was spotted by the 
Terran fleet out beyond Pluto and 
destroyed when it tried to run. It 
was ironic, for he wasn't entering 
the Solar System, but leaving it, 
having done his job. He was doing no harm. 

But in war an enemy is an 
enemy, whether he's doing any 
harm or not. 

II 

THOUGH there must have 
been days when she was near 
the threshold of awareness, it was 
on a definite day, almost at a 
definite second , that she was fully 



conscious and aware of being 
conscious. 

She looked around her, but 
that was unnecessary. Before full 
consciousness there had been perception, and she knew her surroundings. 

She was sitting in a garden — a 
warm, healthy, luxurious garden, 
obviously on Venus. She felt 
light, but on Mars she would be 
lighter still. Here she could hold 
out her arm straight from the 
shoulder and keep it there for 
half an hour without discomfort. 
It was breathing that was most 
different. On Earth, one was seldom completely unaware of it. 
It was a mild labor to breathe, 
raising chest and shoulders, expanding ribs. Here the air seemed 
to flow in and out of its own volition. There was no tendency to 
droop when exhaling. The chest 
didn't fall, it merely grew a little 
smaller. One didn't have to 
breathe fast and shallowly, as on 
Mars. 

On Mars, too, it would be very 
much colder. She was wearing 
white shorts and blouse, nothing 
else. She wasn't heavy enough to 
have to wear shoes to protect her 
feet. And on Venus — a point of 
interest to most women who went 
there — it was usually quite unnecessary to wear a brassiere or a 
girdle. Even flabby pectoral and 
abdominal muscles could hold 
flesh firm against the mild gravi

tational pull of Venus , threetwentieths less than that of Earth. 

Yes, she was on Venus, without 
a doubt. A hundred other things 
confirmed it — the low, heavyclouds, the heat, the perfectly 
diffused sunlight that made shadows almost non-existent, the lustiness of the grass, the haze over 
the forests, the smell of the air . . . 

All of which showed that she 
knew Venus, Earth and Mars, at 
least. 

SHE was alone. But when she 
turned her head, she saw a 
^white building through the trees. 
In the other direction, down the 
hill, she knew there was a tall 
wire fence. This, then, pleasant 
though it might be, was a prison 
of some kind. She fingered her 
blouse thoughtfully. Though 
clean and fine, it was very plain, 
a common pattern, the kind of 
garment that wouldn't generally 
be worn from choice. 

She wasn't disturbed. She 
knew she was called Muriel Martin, and was pretty sure that 
wasn't her real name — but whoever she was, wherever she was, 
however she had got there, she 
was quite confident of her ability 
to handle the situation. 

Trying to look into the past, 
even the recent past, was unpleasant. She gave up the effort as far 
as the distant past was concerned. There was nothing there, and 



a curious finality about the nothing. But she explored the recent 
past conscientiously, ignoring the 
disinclination to do so. 

There were shadow-memories 
of testing and probing, people 
trying to make her do things she 
couldn't do. There was also the 
hurt of being treated as little better than an animal because she 
was little better than an animal, 
yet knowing that she was very 
nearly a sane, intelligent human 
being. But there was no maliciousness in that ; the people were 
really trying to help her. 

There was one spot of maliciousness, however. Something 
concerning a Security officer. He 
had been vile. She didn't remember much about what had happened, but he had been thoroughly 
unpleasant, tearing with his questions and suspicion and anger and 
disbelief at the brain that was 
trying to heal. She classed him, 
on the little she could recall, as 
a petty, frustrated official, the 
kind of man who must always be 
a failure in handling people but 
who so often is permitted to try. 

Before that there was — horror. 
She knew nothing about it and 
didn't want to. Though she 
probed for it grimly, she was 
rather glad when she was forced 
to the realization that it was 
quite unavailable to her. 

She rose lightly. The apparent 
loss of even a small fraction of 



MIND ALONE 



weight makes anyone feel an athlete. An athlete feels like jumping 
over trees. She ran, not because 
she was in any hurry, but because 
she felt like running. 

She stopped when she saw another girl, also alone and also 
wearing the same kind of blouse 
and shorts. This girl was pretty 
but there was something missing 
in her face. Muriel saw that even 
before she spoke. 

Two minutes later Muriel 
turned away. The girl was only 
dimly aware that someone was 
talking to her. She made sounds 
in reply, agreeably, and there was 
clearly no harm in her. But her 
I.Q. couldn't be more than 60 
and was probably much less. 

In half an hour, Muriel had 
spoken to a dozen or so women 
in the grounds — and that was 
enough to show her that she was 
in some kind of home for subnormals. 

Her confidence subsided a 
little. People didn't get into 
places like this without good reason. That blank spot of horror in 
the past— was it really horrible, 
or was it something a sane mind 
should have taken in its stride? 
Had it just been something she 
couldn't take, something she had 
scuttled from in fear instead of 
facing boldly? She was sane 
now, she believed — but perhaps 
that was something that didn't 
happen often. Perhaps she had 



brainstorms. Perhaps . . . 

She put aside the anxious, 
frightened thoughts that rushed 
into her mind. If she wasn't often 
sane, the sooner she made good 
use of this lucid spell the better. 

Anyway, the other women she 
had seen didn't seem to be insane. There might be psychotics 
here, too— but for the most part 
they had seemed merely subnormal. 

She walked up to the house. 
Before crossing the hall, she took 
a pair of sandals from a cupboard just inside the door and 
put them on. That was automatic. 
She wondered how often she had 
been here . . . how often she had 
done that without really knowing 
what she was doing. 

She hesitated before tapping on 
a door at the end of a white corridor. She had a clear enough 
picture of the man inside, though 
she didn't remember his name. 
She had no fear of him, certainly; he was old and kind, though 
sometimes rather fierce. What 
caused her hesitation was the 
sudden realization that she didn't 
know what she herself looked 
like . . . whether she was young 
or old ... 

Resolutely, she tapped at the 
door and went in. 

rWTHE man was as she rem em 
bered him, and she knew at 
once she could trust him. He 



10 




 



wore an ordinary lounge suit, 
which made him almost ludicrously overdressed on Venus. But 
a lot of older people dressed like 
that. It wasn't that they objected 
to scanty apparel, but only that 
they felt they couldn't behave 
with any authority if they were 
half naked. 

"Hallo, Muriel," he said pleasantly. "Sit down." His eyes were 
keen, she saw, not missing much. 

"I think you asked me questions before, doctor," she said 
briskly, "and couldn't get much 
out of me. Would you like to try 
again?" 

The expression on his face became almost delighted. His eagerness, Muriel guessed, was the 
natural sympathy and interest of 
anyone who worked among handicapped people, the joy in any 
sign of improvement. 

"You've recovered your memory?" he asked. 

"No, I'm afraid not. I still 
don't know a thing about myself. 
Not even how old I am or how I 
look." 

The doctor showed no sign of 
disappeintment. "Perhaps we 
should deal with that first," he 
said. "You want to know how 
you look?" 

"Well, I'm naturally interested." She smiled. "Ever meet a 
woman who was more or less 
sane and didn't know whether 
she was tall or short, young or 



old, pretty or ugly?" 

"Before you look at yourself," 
said the doctor, "do you think it's 
all right to do it? I mean, you 
haven't any fear of looking in a 
minor?" 

"No. Only an in — " She stumbled. 

"What's the trouble?" asked 
the doctor sympathetically. She 
remembered now that his name 
was Johnston. 

"Just words. I was going to 
say only a something curiosity, 
but I don't know the word. It 
means very strong." 

"Intense?" 

"That's it. Intense curiosity." 
She tried the words over once or 
twice, and found they came easily
The doctor rose from behind 
his desk and opened a cupboard. 
"There's a full-length mirror inside the door." 

Muriel got up and stood in 
front of the mirror. She had 
braced herself mentally, for she 
hoped she was young but knew 
she might have to bear the disappointment of seeing she was 
old. She wanted to be pretty, but 
the chance of that seemed small 
— she had some shadowy awareness that she wasn't pretty. 

What she saw wasn't anything 
like what she had expected. 

She was young, clearly — not 
more than twenty-five at the 
most. And she was beautiful, 



MIND ALONE 



astonishingly beautiful . . . but 
even that consideration was swept 
away for the moment by something she wouldn't have believed 
possible, even granting her almost complete loss of memory. 

The girl facing her in the mirror was a complete stranger. She 
had never seen her before in her 
life. 

PRESENTLY, Muriel was doing an intelligence test. She 
had told Dr. Johnston, unprompted, that she thought she could do 
a non-verbal test adequately, but 
as yet a verbal test would give a 
misleading result. He said nothing, merely gave her a book and 
a pencil. 

He watched her as she worked; 
it didn't seem to bother her at 
all. He noticed that she tried the 
pencil in one hand, then the other, 
before beginning to write with 
her left, at first awkwardly, and 
then with more precision. He 
hadn't suggested that she should 
work at the desk, waiting to see 
what she would do. She'd crossed 
her legs and worked quite confidently with the book on her 
knee. Stenographer? he wondered. 

She was apparently completely 
sane, but the type of amnesia 
was puzzling. It was oddly selective. It was curious that she 
should remember nothing whatever of her own life and yet have 
almost free access to the normal 



general knowledge and vocabulary of an educated person. He 
knew he wasn't handling her as 
the textbooks said such a case 
should be handled, but he felt 
certain without working it out 
that it was much better to give 
her mind a lot to do than too 
little. She hardly needed directions on how to do the intelligence test. She saw the form of 
it and became absorbed in it. 

Muriel finished the test and 
handed it back to him. He put it 
aside, 

"Aren't you going to check it 
and tell me how I've done?" she 
asked. 

"It isn't normally done." 

"I know. But it would help me, 
I think. I don't know whether 
I'm above or below average. It 
will help me plan my life, when 
I'm ready to plan. I'd like to 
know what that shows, please." 

ITER confidence impressed him. 

From the moment she'd entered the room she had been completely at home, unperturbed by 
the situation. 

He checked the test and referred to a list. 

"This gives you an I.Q. of 130 
plus," he told her. 

"What does that mean?" 

"That you're in the top two per 
cent of the population in intelligence. It doesn't show any more 
than that. The standard devia


12 




 



tion in this test is fifteen ... do 
you know what I'm talking 
about?" 

"I think so. You mean fifteen 
points are arranged to cover about 
a third of all people. A third between 85 and 100, and another 
third between 100 and 115. And 
I'm 130." 

"You're 130 plus. Anything 
over 130. That is, the test takes 
no responsibility for you. It's 
meant to grade normal and subnormal people to a certain extent 
that shouldn't be overestimated." 

"Not absolute but — ?" 

"Empirical. Statistical." 

"I see. What's the next move?" 

Unexpectedly his face grew 
hard, even angry. But she knew 
the anger wasn't against her. 

"Security," he said. "They've 
insisted on seeing you again, as 
soon as possible. I'm afraid it's 
possible now. I'm sorry, Miss 
Martin. Do you remember anything about the last time a Security officer saw you?" 

"Yes, a little — and I don't like 
what I remember. What is this 
Security? Why do they insist on 
seeing me?" 

"They think you might be a 
Murriner spy," said the doctor 
derisively. 

"Murrane," the girl mused. 
"I've never been there and I 
don't want to go there. I'm not 
interested in the war." 

"You know about the war?" 



asked the doctor quickly. 

"Only that there is one. Oh, 
well ... if I have to see this man, 
doctor, it might as well be now." 

Dr. Johnston stared at her for 
a few moments, then nodded. He 
picked up the phone on his desk. 

Ill 

NURSE BRAYNE was a chatterbox. The words poured 
out of her in a sort of verbal 
peipetuum mobile, a pleasant 
sound if one didn't pay too much 
attention to what she was saying. 

"Yes, you're my size, as near 
as makes no difference," she said, 
surveying Muriel. "We'd better 
hurry, Miss Martin — shall I call 
you Muriel? Security said someone would be along about four, 
but it would be just like Security 
to say that and make it two hours 
earlier, to catch you on the hop. 
That's the way they work. Of 
course, it's all necessary and no 
doubt they do a valuable job, but 
sometimes one wonders why they 
have to be so tough about it. I'm 
so glad you're all right now — I 
always thought there was something different about you, you 
always looked so clever, even 
when you were . . . but that's all 
over, and I'm sure you'll be able 
to stand up to this officer and let 
him see he can't push you around 
— he can't really, you know, if 
you only remember you've noth

ing to be afraid of. They're hard 
and suspicious, and they work 
on people by making them nervous and jumpy, and if you refuse to be nervous they have to 
climb down and be civil. Dr. 
Johnston says it's a crime that 
they should be allowed to come 
here and — " 

On it went, with Muriel half 
listening, because she knew so 
little that she could leam even 
from Nurse Brayne. 

It was still only two hours 
since she had come to full consciousness in the garden. She 
knew now that six weeks ago she 
had wandered into a village fifty 
miles away, Norburn, dirty and 
disheveled and completely dazed. 
There had been a search for a 
crashed ship or plane in the vicinity, but nothing was found. 
At first it had been thought that 
she was suffering from ordinary 
shock, but it soon appeared to 
be more than that. She had been 
taken to the nursing home, not 
because that seemed the right 
permanent place for her, but because she had to be sent somewhere where she could be looked 
after. 

"Dr. Johnston's quite right," 
said Nurse Brayne. "You'll feel 
so much more confident if you 
know you're looking your best." 

"Will I?" asked Muriel. "I 
don't think it would make any 
difference to me, Helen." 



"Don't you care about clothes?" 
"No." 

That almost made Nurse 
-Brayne speechless for a while. 

IT had been Dr. Johnston's 
idea to freshen Muriel up before the Security Officer came, 
and in one respect, Muriel agreed, 
it was a good idea. People did 
judge you by your appearance. 
If you were well-groomed and 
immaculately dressed, people 
were a little more cautious with 
you, afraid of what you might 
think, feeling themselves at a 
disadvantage. But in the end, 
your manner mattered more. 

Anyway, Helen Brayne had 
volunteered to take her away and 
make her more presentable. Muriel had showered and was now in 
the nurse's bedroom, waiting patiently for Nurse Brayne to decide what she should wear. 

"Are you a max or a min?" the 
nurse asked. 

"I'm afraid I don't follow that," 
said Muriel. "I can guess you 
mean maximum or minimum, but 
that doesn't help." 

"You must have known, but 
forgotten," said Helen. "Everybody's a max or a min. You wear 
as much as you can for any occasion, or as little." 

Muriel smiled. "No, that's new 
to me . . . but surely people are 
sometimes one thing, sometimes 
the other?" 



14 




 



"It's all right if you've got 
natural taste," said Helen cheerfully. "But how many girls 
have? If they follow a pattern— 
max-min, bright-somber, plainfrilly, and so on — they can be 
sure that they're dressed more or 
less right most of the time. It's 
quite sensible, really. If you're 
overdressed for a ball and underdressed for a garden party, you're 
not giving your personality a 
chance. Are you sure you never 
heard of max-min? You seem to 
know most things, and this has 
been going on for five years now." 

Muriel found that interesting. 
"On Venus and Earth, you 
mean?'* 

"And Mars." 

"Suppose I haven't been on 
Venus or Earth or Mars in the 
last five years?" 

Helen ceased abruptly to be 
the gay chatterbox and became 
the surprisingly efficient nurse. 
"I see what you mean. Or you 
could have lost your memory five 
years ago. But if you weren't 
here, you must have been on 
Murrane." 

"Murrane? I've never been 
there- Isn't there anywhere else 
I could have been?" 

"Not that I know of, unless 
you're an explorer. Well, what 
are you — max or min?" 

"Max, I guess." 

Helen looked surprised. "Oh, 
well, if you say so. People who 



look like you generally prove it, 
if you know what I mean. Say, 
Muriel — " she was serious again 
— "don't give the Security man 
any idea that you've been out of 
this System in the last five years. 
They're suspicious by vocation." 

She turned back to the drawer 
whose contents she was investigating. 

Muriel reflected that perhaps 
the Security men had to be hard 
and tough and suspicious, to 
counteract the openness and 
friendliness of people like Dr. 
Johnston and Nurse Brayne, who 
seemed to take it for granted that 
she couldn't possibly be a spy or 
saboteur or anything of the sort. 

It was more than Muriel took 
for granted herself. 

lV-URSE BRAYNE had been 
' quite right. While she was 
brushing Muriel's hair, over two 
hours before the Security Officer 
was due, there came an imperious 
summons relayed by a rather 
scared nurse. Captain Clark was 
in Dr. Johnston's room and wanted to see Muriel Martin immediately. 

Dr. Johnston met her in the 
hall and, probably against all 
the rules, told her fiercely that if 
that tough jumped-up cop said 
anything she didn't like, she 
could press the bell under the 
desk and he'd come running in 
to take him apart. 



MIND AIONE

"Thanks, doctor," said Muriel 
warmly. "But I don't think it'll 
be necessary, now." 

She had remembered a little 
more of the last occasion when a 
Security Officer had come to see 
her. She'd been able to say only 
a few words at the time, and 
couldn't understand what was going on. But she had felt the truculence of the man, his suspicion, 
his anger; his emotion had been 
like a physical attack on her. 
When he touched her roughly, 
though he hadn't really done anything much, she had felt terrified 
and utterly helpless. He had tried 
to force the truth out of her, 
when the only possible way to get 
anything out of her at all, as Dr. 
Johnston must have told him, 
was to draw it out with infinite 
gentleness and patience, 

Muriel opened the door of the 
doctor's room and went inside. It 
was very different from the last 
time she had entered it, only a 
short time ago. The man behind 
the desk this time was younger 
than she expected, not as hard 
looking as she expected, but quite 
as grim and humorless. He wore 
some kind of uniform, blue and 
spruce. He looked up from some 
papers he held as she came in. 

Muriel was glad, after all, that 
she was neatly and attractively 
dressed. For just a fraction of a 
second, Captain Clark's eyes 
widened and flickered over her, 



and she knew that he was human. 
It was worth it for that. 

Then he was himself again. 
"Please disabuse your mind," he 
said coldly, "of anything you've 
heard about Security in this 
somewhat uncooperative establishment." 

That was nasty. In typical Security fashion, even with a girl 
in a nursing home, he was starting off by trying to cow her, to 
undermine her confidence in herself. 

"It's all right," said Muriel 
easily. "I'm disabused." 

"I didn't say you could sit 
down," said Clark sharply, as 
she moved toward the other 
chair, 

SHE sat down. "Captain Clark," 
she said, "I started off with 
the fixed determination of cooperating with you all I possibly 
could. Are you going to insist on 
making it hard for me to do 
that?" 

"Yes," he said. 
"Why?" 

"I'm asking the questions." 

"You haven't asked any yet." 

"Why are you determined to 
cooperate? Because you have 
something to hide?" 

Muriel laughed. "Could be. 
I'm hiding it very successfully 
from myself, and I could do with 
your help, or anyone else's to 
find out what it is."

"Do you realize I have the 
power of life and death over 
you?" 

"No. I don't think you have." 

"I give you my solemn word 
that if I thought you were a Murriner and had any chance of escaping, I'd shoot you here and 
now." 

"Oh, no doubt. But that's hardly relevant, is it?" 

She had realized some time ago 
that he was acting a part. The 
other Security Officer, whom she 
dimly remembered, had been 
either a different type of man or 
a much better actor — but the goal 
was the same. They both tried to 
push her, to annoy her, to frighten her. Only the first officer had 
succeeded. The second wasn't going to. 

"How do you feel about the 
Earth -M inrane war?" 

"I don't give a damn about the 
war." 

"Why is that?" Clark rapped. 
"We're fighting for our System, 
our very lives, and you don't 
care?" 

"No, I'm afraid not. Maybe 
I've had nothing to do with the 
war." 

"Don't try to explain it. I can 
see what your answers mean. Do 
you think we should just surrender to the Murriners?" 

"I don't know- about that. Remember, I've only just waked up. 
What are you trying to do, put 



me back to sleep again?" 

"Ah," said Clark softly, "I've 
touched a tender spot, have I?" 

"No. That was an honest request for information." 

Clark came out from behind 
the desk. "Sit closer to the desk," 
he said, standing over her. 

"What for?" demanded Muriel 
warily. 

"Sit closer!" he shouted. 

SHE pulled her chair closer to 
the desk. She had an idea, by 
this time, that nothing very serious was going to happen. He 
took a small plastic case from his 
pocket, placed it on the desk in 
front of her and opened it. Inside 
was a morse key, a small light 
and a buzzer. 

"Hold that key down,'* he said. 
v "When the light goes on and the 
buzzer sounds, let the key up as 
quickly as you can. Got that?" 

"Yes." Muriel searched her 
mind for the term 'reaction time', 
but though the idea was perfectly 
clear, she couldn't quite find the 
words* 

Twenty times the buzzer 
sounded and the light flashed. 
Then Clark opened the back of 
the little case and took out a 
card. 

"Point three six, point two 
nine, two seven, three two, three 
one — " he read. 

"I don't believe you," said 
Muriel. 



MIND ALONE 



17 



He grunted, but didn't let her 
see the card. He was a very bad 
actor* Muriel thought. It was 
quite obvious that he was no 
longer in the least suspicious of 
her, though he kept up the pretense of brusqueness. He was 
really rather nice, she thought, 
sensing the good nature behind 
his formidable front. 

She found the term she was 
looking for. "Murriners have 
slower reaction times than we 
do, then?" she asked, interested. 

"You didn't know that?" 

"I believe I did. Is the hold-up 
at the synapses?" 

He tried to snap back at her, 
but couldn't. "No, the transmission through the nerve fiber is 
slower." 

"Of course. Range of about 
four to sixty meters a second, instead of five to a hundred — funny 
how I can remember figures. But 
that couldn't always be a conclusive test, then." 

Clark simulated biting sarcasm. "Maybe you could find a 
better one?" 

"I'm sure I could. A blood test, 
perhaps. Isn't there something in 
Murrane's air, soluble in the 
blood, thajt affects the endocrine 
glands — modifying the chemical 
reactions, changing some of the 
enzymes . , ." 

"Sure," said Clark. "Only I 
can't carry around a laboratory 
I can carry this. Say, aren't you 



supposed to have lost your memory?" he added, forgetting to be 
tough. 

"I was surprised I remembered 
that," said Muriel, pleased. "Tell 
you what, let me test my own 
blood and I'll tell you whether 
I'm a Murriner or not." 

It was too much for Captain 
Peter Clark. He stared at her for 
a moment, then laughed. 

"All right," he said. "You win. 
Can I call you Muriel?" 

IV 

"TOTHEN Captain Peter Clark 
^ left the Veborn nursing 
home, he should have been beginning to forget that Muriel 
Martin even existed. His job in 
Security was counter-espionage, 
nothing else. Having satisfied 
himself that Muriel wasn't a 
Murriner, he had done his job, 
and as far as he was concerned 
she should have ceased to exist. 

But back on Murrane no allowance had been made for the 
fact that Peter Clark was younger than most Security Officers 
and had always liked intelligent 
brunettes who didn't lose their 
tempers. Murriners, naturally, 
had a different view of Security 
Officers, and certainly didn't regard them as human beings. 

So instead of starting to forget 
Muriel, Clark was running over 
possible excuses to pursue the 



18 




 



matter, and Muriel. 

At the nursing home, Muriel 
was assuring Dr. Johnston and 
Nurse Brayne that Security Officers weren't as bad as they 
thought. 

"He explained himself afterwards," she said. "I suppose I 
shouldn't pass it on to you, but 
I don't think it will do any harm. 
Murriners feel inferior — they 
can't help it. They deny it, of 
course, even boast that a Murriner is better than a Terran any 
day, but it's there. They're angrydefensive. And the best way to 
discover them is to be angry-offensive. I saw Clark was only 
trying to annoy me, and that 
what was said didn't really matter. So he didn't annoy me at 
all." 

Dr. Johnston had been looking 
at her closely as she spoke. 
"You're quite normal, Miss Martin," he said. "In fact, I rarely 
met anyone saner- You're almost 
aggressively sane." 

Muriel laughed. "Yes. But tell 
me — what can I do now?" 

"You can walk out of here any 
time you like, now that you've 
been passed by Security. But 
that doesn't help you much, since 
you haven't any job or relatives 
or money. I suggest that you work 
in the office here. It won't pay 
much, but at least you'll be independent and we'll be able to help 
you to get your bearings." 



"Thanks, doctor," Said Muriel 
warmly. "I'll do that for a while 
anyway. Am I really free?" 

"Of course. It isn't a crime to 
have lost your memory. You were 
never certified, and this isn't anasylum." 

Impulsively Nurse Brayne, an 
affectionate creature, put her arm 
around Muriel's shoulders. "We'll 
try to make you happy," she 
said. 

rpHREE days later Muriel had 
taken over the running of the 
office. No one there had any organizing ability, and everyone 
was glad to pass the reins over to 
her. 

She didn't believe, however, 
that she had ever worked in an 
office before. She found she was 
much more at home in the 
pharmacy. Gradually things were 
being confirmed or denied. She 
was a chemist of sorts, but not a 
doctor. Yet a lot of biology was 
familiar to her, and when she 
discovered anthropology the subject was clearly not new to her. 
In mechanics she was completely 
blank; dynamics meant nothing 
to her. In fact, there were subjects on the technological side 
that she didn't even seem to have 
heard of. Chemistry was the best 
bet. She regained whole chunks 
of knowledge merely by picking 
up bottles and looking at the 
labels. 



MIND ALONE 



19 



She was learning all the time, 
and enjoying the process. Often 
she would merely look at the 
name of a substance, and into her 
mind would come a picture of it 
and all the things it would do. 

On the fourth day she had a 
visitor. 

"Not Captain Clark," he protested. "Call me Peter. Can you 
take the afternoon off?" 

' 'Easily ," she said, "if I'm 
shown a good reason." 

He frowned. ""I don't know 
whether it's good or not," he admitted, "but I've been thinking 
it up ever since I saw you last." 

She laughed, and gave herself 
the afternoon off. 

THEY didn't have to stay in 
the grounds, but they didn't 
go far from them. One couldn't 
sit anywhere on Venus without 
being soaked, but Peter was prepared. He spread a thin plastic 
groundsheet on the steaming 
grass. Murie! sat at one corner of 
it and motioned him to stay on 
the other. 

"Not too close," she told him. 
"I may be married, you know, 
and I'd better stay faithful just 
in case." 

Peter's eyes widened. "I never 
thought of that," he said. "Let's 
see your left hand . . . look, you 
never wore a ring!" 

"Doesn't prove anything," she 
smiled. "Now, what about this 



reason you were going to show 
me?" 

Peter became more serious. 
"Frankly, at first I was only 
looking for an excuse to see you 
again," he admitted. "And if I 
hadn't found one, I'd have come 
anyway. But I did find one, I 
think. What does your history, as 
far as you know it, suggest to you 
about how you lost your memory? Anything?" 

She shook her head. "Does it 
suggest something to you?" 

"Yes, You didn't lose your 
memory. You had it lost for 
you." 

He put it bluntly, and Muriel 
not only understood at once, but 
also agreed with it. 

"But how could that happen?" 
she asked. "You mean someone 
hit me over the head, or something?" 

"No — not that kind of thing at 
all. If someone loses her memory 
by what you might call natural 
means, she's not normal and confident but without her personal 
history, like you. She's dazed and 
lost and doubtful, and she has 
quite a lot of her personal history, 
if she remembers as much as you 
do. Loss of identity is common, 
but—" 

"I see what you mean," said 
Muriel slowly. "People wouldn't 
have language and knowledge — 
but not a single recollection of 
anything that ever happened to 



20 




 



them. I don't remember any person I ever knew, or going to 
school, or what I used to look 
like—" 

TTE was on that like a flash. For 
an hour or so, they carefully 
examined what she knew and 
what she didn't. Nothing very 
much emerged from it, but 
Peter's idea got some support. It 
was as if everything she had ever 
learned had been put either into 
a personal or a general memory 
bank, and then the personal bank 
had been taken away. 

"Which doesn't happen by accident," he said. "Muriel, there's 
one psychiatrist on Venus who 
might be able to find out something more about this. Will you 
go and see him?'' 

"Of course. Who is he?" 

"Dr. Waterson, at Finylake. I 
can fly you there any day you 
like." 

They settled the details of 
that, and Peter heaved a sigh of 
relief. "That was all very well," 
he said, "but I came out with a 
girl, not a psychiatric case. Can 
I move a little closer, please?" 

"How about my not-out-ofthe- question husband?" 

"You don't remember any husband, do you? Well, you haven't 
got one." He moved closer. 

"Quite a lot of people would 
refuse to believe this of a Security Officer," Muriel observed 



brightly. "Aren't they all hard 
and tough and unsympathetic?" 

"That's just a myth. Just give 
me a chance and I'll prove it." 
He moved closer still. 

"Suppose I were to turn out to 
be a Murriner spy?" 

"That's the core of the whole 
thing," said Peter with satisfaction. "This is bare-faced blackmail. If you don't let me kiss you, 
I'll tell Security you're a Murriner after all, and they'll take you 
out and shoot you. See?" 

"I don't want to be shot," Muriel admitted. He took her in his 
arms and kissed her very thoroughly. 

TAR. WATERSON was one of 
the new electronic psychiatrists. He seemed to have grown 
a little electronic himself; he 
hummed like an electric motor as 
he worked, his little black eyes 
glittered like nuclei, and his black 
hair perpetually stood on end as 
if charged with electricity. 

He ignored Muriel and Peter 
completely as he gathered data 
from his various machines. 
Though he used a lot of apparatus, his work was by no means 
all electronic. The word in any 
case was a misnomer; it had been 
applied to men like Dr. Waterson 
through wholesale confusion of 
psychiatry and cybernetics, encephalogr aphs and electronic 
brains, electricity and electronics, 



MIND ALONE 



21 



and had been so generally used 
that it had stuck. Now Waterson 
himself called his profession electronic psychiatry — an example of 
the power of the uninformed layman. 

Dr. Waterson 's work wasn't all 
electric, then — he had put some 
pretty shrewd questions to Muriel while connecting her to this 
machine and that, and she was 
wondering, now that it was over, 
how much of his use of impressive apparatus was window-dressing. 

At lasfThe said, "I'm not going 
to charge you anything, Miss 
Martin. Which means, I'm afraid, 
that I can't produce any results." 

"What we know now is tentative, doctor,' ' Peter put in. 
"Can't you add anything, even 
if it's tentative too?" 

"I can only say this. // any 
tampering with Miss Martin's 
brain was done — and I admit 
that this is a reasonable conclution to reach — it was very well 
done. There is certainly an interesting problem here. It seems 
extremely unlikely that your loss 
of memory is due to any neurosis, Miss Martin. There is neurosis present, of course — " 

"There is?" said Peter, startled. 

The psychiatrist smiled faintly. "I should hardly mention it, 
if it were significant. There are 
certain fixed patterns, or nearly 
fixed patterns, and fixation is 




22 




 



neurosis. I didn't investigate 
those, because they seem to have 
nothing to do with the loss of 
memory. They seem to have been 
acquired afterward, possibly as a 
result . . . however, the loss of 
memory, if not neurotic, would 
certainly appear to be the result 
of some operation — " 

"Surgical?" asked Peter. 

T\R. WATERSON shook his 
head. "There is no evidence 
of surgery. But there is also no 
evidence of anything else. I merely assume, from a fair knowledge 
of the human mind, that it is not 
surgical. I wish I could say more. 
I can only repeat — if anything 
has been done, it has been, very 
well done. That simplifies the 
matter, if you wish to pursue it." 

"Simplifies it?" Muriel exclaimed. "I should have thought it 
would be the other way round." 

"Simplifies it," repeated the 
psychiatrist patiently. "Have you 
a lot of money, Miss Martin?" 

"No." 

"A pity. If you had, I should 
advise you to go to Earth and 
consult some of the leading electronic psychiatrists there. You 
would soon find yourself on the 
right track. The quality of this 
hypothetical operation, you see, 
means that only a very few people could possibly have done it." 

"I see," said Muriel. 

As he was showing them out, 



23 



he asked curiously, "Do you intend to proceed with this, Miss 
Martin?" 

She hesitated. "I don't think 
so. It's not of tremendous importance to me, and anyway it'll be 
quite a while before I'll be able 
to afford to go to Earth." 

"A pity. You would have to go 
there. All the men who might be 
able to help you are there. Or on 
Murrane." 

If he hadn't added the last 
three words, principally to himself, the matter would probably 
have died there. But Peter heard 
them and whirled around. 

"Murrane!" he exclaimed. 

"I didn't propose Miss Martin 
should go there," said the psychiatrist dryly. 

' 'You mean there are people 
on Murrane who might have 
done this to Muriel?" 

"If anything was done, yes. 
Murrane is probably well ahead 
of us in electronic psychiatry. It's 
the only branch of psychiatry 
they have, I believe." 

"Then something will be done 
about this," said Peter. "Security 
is taking it up. Come on, Muriel. 
You're going to Security HQ 
after all!" 

V 

WHILE Peter's little plane 
was making the short hop 
from Finylake to Veborn, Muriel 



asked coolly, "Am I a prisoner, 
Peter?" 

"That would be a very difficult 
question to answer," said Peter 
cheerfully. "Let's pretend you 
didn't ask it, shall we?" 

"No. I don't like that attitude 
at all. I want to know where I 
stand." 

"How can anyone possibly tell 
you where you stand? That's 
what we're trying to find out." 

"What are we going to do?" 

"First, you'll have a thorough 
medical examination. That'll 
show pretty definitely whether 
you could be a native Murriner 
or not. If that's negative, as I 
expect it will be, I'm going to take 
you to Earth to see those psychiatrists that Dr. Waterson mentioned." 

"Why?" 

"I don't know exactly why," 
Peter admitted. "You don't know 
anything about Security, Muriel, 
do you? Well, it's an important 
job. This war is being fought 
mainly by two strong fleets that 
are trying to destroy each other, 
not advance on other objectives. 
Our fleet, say, can't afford to go 
too far from this System while 
the Murriner fleet is still strong. 
It can't afford to attack Murrane, because that would allow 
the Murriners to attack Earth 
freely. Space is big, and the only 
thing that prevents either side 
blasting the other's base is the 



24 




 



knowledge that the fleet that 
tried it would be a total loss. Do 
you get the idea? There's no split 
between defense and attack any 
more — it's just one fleet against 
another-" 

"Go on. I don't quite see how 
it must be like that, but 1*11 take 
your word for it." 

"Our high command can't be 
with the fleet, because that's too 
mobile. The planning is probably done on Earth, but the real 
bese may be on Venus or Mars 
or even Pluto for all I know. 
Anyway, you can see that in a 
war like this, gains by either 
side can only be made by doing 
something slightly out of the ordinary. A raid on Murrane can 
be made and it can be effective, 
provided it's carefully planned 
and the enemy gets no hint of 
the plan. 

"There's the rub. Our spies 
get little or nothing out of Murrane, and Murrane is obviously 
getting quite a lot out of us. In 
direct proportion to that, they're 
doing better than we are. 

"So Earth, at the moment, is 
losing this war, despite greater 
potential — and the section that's 
failing is Security. Murrane is 
keeping this a battle of espionage 
and counter-espionage, and winning it. Do you see why we have 
to follow up any line that shows 
itself? If you were to turn out 
to be a Murriner spy, we'd be 

MIND ALONE 



glad we'd found you, but it 
wouldn't mean very much. We've 
found plenty of Murriner spies. 
But if we found something that 
was new — " 

He brought the plane down 
neatly at Veborn landing-field. 
Almost at once the door was 
opened and two Security Officers 
waited on either side of it for 
Muriel to come out. 

"Then I am a prisoner?" she 
said. 

"I wish you'd just take things 
as they come, Muriel," he said. 
"You've nothing to be afraid of." 

"Yes, I have." Incredibly, 
Muriel burst into tears. "You're 
trying to make me go to Murrane!" she cried. 

Amazed, Peter stared at her. 

fT^HE examination put it beyond 
doubt that Muriel was a native Terran. 

"Apart from her slightly above 
normal reaction time," the doctor 
observed, "there are several small 
things which, taken in the aggregate, show that she was born and 
grew up on Earth. I can't, of 
course, tell you whether she has 
ever been on Murrane or not. 
There are indications that she 
has. But any trace there may be 
of the Murrane enzymes is negligible." 

Peter visited Muriel in what 
he insisted on calling her room, 
not her cell. 

35 



"I've been talking to Dr. Johnston, Muriel," he said. "I told 
him you've been co-opted into 
Security." 

Muriel was calm and at ease 
again. She had been as amazed 
as Peter at her breakdown. She 
wanted to know what could have 
made her do that. 

"And have I?" she asked. 

He shook his head. "I have a 
theory," he said quietly, "that 
you were in it already.'* 

Muriel started, but didn't 
speak. 

"The doctor here added a few 
things to what we know about 
you," Peter went on. "Still nothing definite, but 'it's building up. 
Waterson said your brain might 
have been tampered with by a 
very good electronic psychiatrist. 
The doctor here says you may 
have spent a long time on Murrane." 

"Does he? I thought he said — " 
"I persuaded him to go a little 
further after you'd gone. You 
see, we have to give people the 
benefit of the doubt, and he was 
assuming that you were a suspect, that your life depended on 
what he said. So he stated, correctly, that the traces of Murrane 
enzymes in your blood were negligible. But when I told him the 
true circumstances and some of 
my own ideas, he admitted that 
while he wouldn't convict you on 
it, he was pretty certain that you 



had been on Murrane . . . possibly for some time. Unfortunately, while your mind was 
recovering, your body has been 
dissipating all traces of Murrane." 

Muriel nodded. "That's so. 
Heavy tan, Vitamin D restored, 
reaction time accelerating again 
— if I was on Murrane* but only 
for a year or two, the journey 
here and a few weeks out in the 
open on Venus would cover up 
just about everything." 

"The doctor also says," Peter 
went on, "that you've been 
physically changed in some way. 
There are things about you that 
don't match. But that, again, was 
well done. Though there have 
been surgical operations, the main 
thing was a metabolic change. He 
can't say what you were like before." 

"Another thing," said Muriel 
quietly — and she told him how 
she and Nurse Brayne had first 
concluded that she might not 
have been on Earth during the 
last few years. 

"It all fits," said Peter. 

"With what?" 

"It would all make sense," he 
said slowly, "if you were a Tsrran agent on Murrane, were 
found out, and for some reason of 
their own they didn't kill you but 
sent you back here, altered." 

Muriel tried that for size. 

"It seems to make a certain 



26 




 



limited amount of sense," she 
said cautiously. 

"Despite the definite fact that 
you were never on Murrane?" 

"I . . . I'm not sure. But I do 
know I'm never going there I" 

"That/' said Peter, "is the 
most significant part of all." 

VI 

fTlHE hop from Venus to Earth 
was almost all acceleration 
and deceleration, and most people stayed in their bunks. Muriel 
used the time to read up on Murrane and the war. She had to 
overcome a disinclination even 
to read about them, but it could 
be done. She became interested 
in what she was reading, and the 
disinclination to have anything 
whatever to do with Murrane 
lost some of its force. 

But she remained quite determined that it was out of the 
question for her ever to go there. 

She took it in three parts — 
Murrane itself, the war, and how 
either of these affected her or 
might possibly affect her. She had 
provided herself with half a dozen pocketbooks, which she scanned for the meat in them. 

First, Murrane. 

It was a cold world, but so 
suitable for colonization in other 
respects that the cold was accepted. There were no seasons; 
the inclination of the equator to 



the orbit was less than one degree, and its eccentricity was also 
extremely small. The year was 
216 days and the day thirty-eight 
hours, making a period which 
wasn't a great deal different from 
Earth's year. The diameter was 
7500 miles, less than that of 
Earth, less even than that of 
Venus, but the mass and density 
made up for that. Temperature 
was Murrane's one drawback. A 
top limit of 65 degrees F. had 
been recorded, but normal equatorial temperature range was 
from to 50 degrees F. Naturally, all the Murriner towns and 
cities were in a thousand-mile 
belt around the equator. 

Muriel found she knew all this 
as soon as she looked at it. She 
knew more, without going farther in the book. She knew that 
Murrane, surprisingly, was teeming with warm-blooded life, with 
no intelligent animals to prey on 
it until men came along. She 
knew that Murrane was rich fn 
metals of all kinds. She knew 
that hydro-electric power was 
abundant. She knew how the 
Murriners dressed, in a one-piece 
snowsuit with a hood, over several layers of fine underclothing 
that trapped many blankets of 
air as insulation. 

It was pretty obvious that she 
had been on Murrane, despite 
the insistence by one part of her 
mind that she had not. 



MIND ALONE 



27 



She passed on to a brief review of the war. She didn't feel 
any need to read more about 
Murrane and its people and history. 

She knew all about them. 

TT was a strange war. It had 
started out of mere suspicion, 
jealousy and differences, without 
warning. Earth had been careless, 
Murrane precipitate. Murrane 
was the attacker, but there were 
people on Earth who blamed 
Earth for the war. After all, there 
was such a historical record of 
colonies turning against the parent country that it didn't seem 
unfair to say Earth should have 
been more alert and never let a 
war like this happen. 

From the first, it was a space 
war. There had been raids on 
Earth and Murrane, but they 
weren't worth the trouble. Each 
side insured that the other 
couldn't have a base near its 
own territory; any force raiding 
the enemy planet, therefore, had 
to start from home, evade the 
enemy fleet, advertise its presence by an attack against objectives which were in any case well 
guarded, and then try to get 
home again. 

It couldn't be done. It was a 
plain matter of statistics. If ships 
made long detours, their offensive 
power was cut down by the necessity for so much fuel and 



provisions. Moreover, they were 
unavailable, useless, not paying 
their way, all the time they were 
on the two long journeys. And if 
they attempted quick, bold raids, 
they were poking their heads into 
a natural trap. If the Terran 
fleet did nothing until a Murriner 
force attacked Earth, it could 
then pick off the" Murriners as 
and how it liked, where it liked, 
when it liked. 

Since the whole campaign was 
one of fleet maneuvers, anything 
that could be found out about 
those movements was in itself a 
victory. And at this the Murriners 
were leading easily. After all, to 
even a fifth -generation Murriner 
— that was as far as it went yet 
— everything Terran was familiar, and Earth was a second home. 
All the books were about Earth, 
the language was the same, Murriner cities were copies of Terran 
cities. A Murriner, save for the 
small physical differences, was a 
natural spy to send secretly to 
Earth. 

Terrans, on the other hand, 
could know little about Murrane. 
It was changing rapidly, while 
Earth stayed the same. Information was scanty instead of abundant. An untrained Terran on 
Murrane would betray himself 
in five minutes, while an untrained Murriner on Earth was safely 
mingling with the crowd and 
learning what he needed to know.

VF7HAT had been forgotten, for 
" the umpteenth time, was 
>Uat from the moment a man 
vat to a colony he was a colon(, not a Terrah. The colony, 
lierever it was, was his home. 
i't> go there at all, he must have 
preferred the colony to Earth. He 
was a malcontent or a pioneer. 
Before any quarrel started, his 
side in it was fixed. 

Another thing was that Earth 
couldn't help underestimating 
Murrane. That had happened, 
was happening, and would continue to happen. The Terran 
Command was getting over that 
error, but the people of Venus, 
Earth and Mars probably never 
would. They underestimated 
Murrane in many respects, but 
the main one was man-power. 
Knowing that Earth alone could 
swallow the whole population of 
Murrane in one country, they 
shrugged off the whole question 
of possible victory for the Colony. 
They forgot that only a tiny 
proportion of Earth's potential 
could be used, and that for the 
most part Earth's billions considered that their duty in the 
matter ended with reading the 
newspapers. 

Not much was made in the 
books of the physical differences 
between Terrans and the Colonists, Muriel noticed. Probably 
unimportant. They certainly 
weren't the cause of the conflict. 



When she came to the question of how all this concerned 
her, the answer was surprisingly 
simple. 

It didn't. 

Or didn't seem to. 

At New York, Peter took 
Muriel straight to the Security 
building. 

"This isn't my section at all, of 
course," he said, "but I'm going 
to see if I can get permission to 
follow this thing through to the 
end. Mind?" 

She didn't answer that. She 
certainly didn't object to Peter 
staying around, but what exactly 
to say to him , in the c ircum stances, was a puzzle she couldn't 
solve. 

VII 

A FTER days of exhaustive 
tests, a nameless director at 
the Security building told Muriel : 
"I don't think you can possibly 
be an agent of ours sent to Murrane, Miss Martin." 

"Allowing for all possible surgical and medical transformation?" asked Peter, who had been 
there most of the time. He had 
been given permission to continue 
the investigation of the strange 
case of Muriel Martin. 

"Allowing for all possible 
change and about twenty per 
cent over the top, for luck. I'm 
not going to give the figures, even

to you, Captain Clark, but you 
can imagine that the number of 
women agents we send to Murrane is small. And of the women 
who have been landed on Murrane, we can definitely account 
for a fair number. You are in 
some way or another disqualified 
from being any one of the remainder." 

"Can you put some sort of percentage of probability on it?" 
Peter asked. "I mean, there are 
strong improbabilities already in 
Miss Martin's case. If we are 
ever to find out anything, we'll 
probably have to accept some improbability or other." 

"I should say the chances 
against Miss Martin having been 
an agent of ours," said the director, "would be about five hundred to one." 

Peter rose. "We'll have to see 
if we can find a better chance 
than that, Muriel," he said. 
"Thanks, director." 

Something more definite was 
provided by the first electronic 
psychiatrist they visited. He was 
prepared to state definitely that 
electronic psychiatry had been 
used. 

"Just taking the patterns of 
what you know and what you 
don't, Miss Martin," he said, 
"they're too neat and definite to 
be the result of any kind of mental illness. But . . ." 

He stared thoughtfully at Mu


riel, then at Peter — who wasn't in 
uniform — and back to Muriel. 

"This is certainly a criminal 
case," he said bluntly. "You 
would hardly have permitted 
anything of this sort, Miss Martin. I suggest you go to the police, for your own safety. Anyone who went to the trouble of — " 

Peter showed him his badge. 
"If you feel you must report on 
this, doctor," he said, "please 
report to Security, not to the 
civil police." 

"I see," said the psychiatrist. 
"I suggest you consult Dr. Hyneker. You understand, electronic psychiatry is a new branch. 
I'm a practitioner, not one of the 
founders of the science. Dr. 
Hyneker or Dr. Ball may be able 
to help you further, where I 
can't." 

So they went to see Dt. Hyneker. 

VIII 

DR. Hyneker was curiously like 
the psychiatrist they had 
seen on Venus. He gave the same 
impression of being a machine 
himself, as if this new branch of 
science was actually turning men 
into quick, jerky, shrewd-eyed 
machines. 

They told him as little as possible, to see what he could find 
out for himself. Rather surprisingly, the thing he picked out 




 



mid concentrated on was Muriel's 
disinclination to go to Murrane. 

"Before your own conclusions 
ian be trusted, Miss Martin," 
he observed, arranging and rearranging papers on his desk, 
"you must remove this fixation." 

"That's interesting, but how do 
I do it?" Muriel asked, smiling. 

"Go to Murrane." 

Muriel had got over trembling 
with fright or bursting into tears 
whenever the idea was mentioned. 
But she frowned, still not liking 
it. 

Peter shot a glance at her, and 
spoke for her. "Quite so, doctor," 
he observed, "but how would you 
suggest she do it?" 

The doctor took a sheaf of 
papers from the bottom of a 
pile and began to deal them out 
on the desk like a pack of cards. 

"I admit the suggestion, at the 
moment, is somewhat impracticable," he said. "However, often 
we psychiatrists must be impractical. Someone comes in and I 
examine him and find the only 
real solution to his problem is 
for him to become a great violinist. But perhaps he has no 
talent whatever. What do I do?" 

He sighed. "Long ago I decided that where people appeared 
to be reasonably intelligent and 
stable, the thing to do was to tell 
them the answer, however impossible it seemed. Last year I told 
a man to go home and beat his 



wife. I was quite certain, I must 
admit, that he would never be 
able to do it. Apparently I was 
wrong. They're now very happy 
and contented together." 

TTE collected together the papers he had dealt out and 
began to fan them out like a 
bridge hand. "I do this, for example, because I want to pile 
all these papers together and set 
fire to the lot. Impossible — by 
my own decision. So I relieve my 
feelings by controlling them, destroying their significance, then 
restoring it." 

"But just a minute, doctor," 
said Muriel. "I- haven't come 
here as a patient, not in the 
normal sense. I don't really want 
to be cured of anything, because 
I'm not aware of anything radically wrong. Except for my 
memory, and I'm told I can't 
have that back because there's 
nothing there. All I want is to 
find out what happened to me. 
To know," 

Dr. Hyneker's eyes opened 
wide. "But obviously you can 
only find that on Murrane," he 
said chidingly, as if she should 
have known that. 

"What!" exclaimed Peter. 

"Of course." He still seemed 
astonished that what he said 
wasn't obvious. "Here we have a 
fairly neat removal "of certain 
memories, and over all — very 



MIND ALONE 



untidy — a threat, a positive 
prohibition against going to Murrane The job as a whole is extremely amateurish — other things, 
like your conditioned disinterest 
in the Earth -Murrane war, make 
it clear that you were not supposed to know that Murrane was 
concerned at all. But obviously, 
from this artificial respect and 
fear and warning this — this untidy blot over the good work 
that preceded it, Murrane is the 
key to the whole thing, and if 
you ever want to find an answer, 
you must go there." 

He shuffled the papers in his 
hand. Muriel observed automatically that they were getting 
rather crumpled and dog-eared 
by this time. 

"I'm sorry," he said in a different tone, "that it's impossible for 
you to go to Murrane, Miss Martin. Yours is a very interesting 
case. I should like to see it resolved in some way." 

Peter was about to speak, but 
Muriel waved him silent. From 
the expression on his face, he 
didn't appear to have anything 
very helpful to say. 

"You mean if I were to go to 
Murrane,'* she said slowly, "I'd 
know, just because of that, what 
this was all about?" 

"Possibly. It may be more difficult than that. If I say more, I'm 
guessing . . is that understood? 
Very well, then: After the treat


ment I and others, apparently, 
have given you, you may take it 
that merely by returning to Murrane — " 

"Returning!* ' Peter shouted . 
"You're sure of that?" 

TAR. Hyneker turned a pained 
countenance on him. "This 
isn't recognized behavior for a 
psychiatrist's consulting room, 
young man," he observed. "If 
you don't restrain yourself, I 
shall have to continue this discussion with Miss Martin alone. 

"I took the fact that you have 
been there before for granted," 
he went on, to Muriel. "As I was 
saying, you may take it that 
merely by returning to Murrane 
you will probably, by this time, 
break down the fixation completely. You will then, as far as 
I can see, be wholly rational, in 
the loose way we generally use 
the term. Going to Murrane 
guarantees nothing else. But it 
would probably open up at once 
some knowledge of the world 
which would show you definitely 
that you had previously been 
there. And that knowledge might 
even make it clear to you where 
to look further. There wouldn't 
be so definite a prohibition 
against something, if disregarding the prohibition wasn't liable 
to produce something — " 

"Of course," said Peter. He had 
himself in control now, and spoke 




 



quite calmly. "Muriel, all this 
makes sense." 

"But I can't possibly — ■* 

"Doctor," said Peter. "Suppose 
we merely landed her on some 
quiet, unoccupied spot on Murrane and took her off again. 
Would that—?" 

"We?" said the doctor. 

Again Peter had to show his 
badge. 

"I don't know," said Dr. Hyneker. "The only way to find out 
would be to try. I doubt it. Miss 
Martin would probably have to 
make closer contact with the life 
and conditions of Murrane than 
that before anything very remarkable would happen." 

Then, carelessly, he threw another small bombshell. "If you 
by any chance do go to Murrane, Miss Martin," he said, "I'd 
advise you to be very careful 
about visiting a town called 
Rillan, and particularly a Dr. 
James Ball who lives there. Because, much as I hate to say it, 
I fear that whatever was done to 
you must have been done by him 
or under his direction," 

IX 

riiHEY asked him all he knew 
about James Ball, but he 
waved that aside. "I haven't seen 
him for years," he said. "He's 
done most of his work on Murrane." 



"A Murriner?" asked Peter. 

"Depends what you mean by 
a Murriner. He chooses to work 
there, on what he calls the fundamental problems of psychiatry. 
The removal of your personal 
memories might have been his 
work, Miss Martin. The rest is 
rather, clumsy for a man of his 
skill. I should have doubted 
whether he'd turn against Earth 
— but then, he's lived on Murrane for some time. If you want 
further information on Dr. Ball, 
I'm not the one to give it. There's 
a daughter, I think, here in New 
York. Go and see her." 

So Muriel and Peter found 
themselves on the move a gain. 
Peter wanted to talk about what 
Dr. Hyneker had said, but Muriel 
made it clear that she didn't. He 
bore it until they were within a 
block of the address Dr. Hyneker 
had given them. Then he caught 
Muriel's arm and stopped her. 

"Let's* try to work this out, 
Muriel," he said. "If this Dr. 
Ball was the man who worked 
on your brain — " 

"I think he must be," said 
Muriel thoughtfully. "I remember Rillan. I've been there, I'm 
sure. But what harm can it do 
to see Barbara Ball? She can't 
very well be in touch with Murrane." 

"That's one thing to find out 
first. Wait here while I ring 
Security." 



MIND ALONE 



He disappeared into a drugstore. He was gone only a few 
minutes. He came back looking 
thoughtful. 

"Security say they've been 
watching her for a long time. 
She was at school here when the 
war started — there isn't much 
schooling on Murranej of course, 
and Barbara was only there for 
a year when she was fourteen. 
The rest of the time she's been 
on Earth. Since the war, it seems 
she's been moving heaven and 
earth to get herself into Security 
as an agent on Murrane. They 
have nothing against her, but refused her at first because she 
was too young, and now because 
she's probably more concerned 
about joining up with her father 
again than working for Earth. 

"But," he went on, "it seems 
there's another daughter, Lorna, 
with Dr. Ball at Rillan. What 
do you think of that?" 

"Should I think anythfng about 
that?" she asked, puzzled. 

Peter didn't insist on the idea. 
"Oh, well, let's go and see Barbara." 

"OARBARA was nineteen, very 
small, rather dark-skinned, 
and would have been called 
pretty only by someone determined to see the best in her. It 
would have been in order, however, to call her attractive — she 
had quite a neat figure, rather on 



the thin side, and thick dark hair 
with a luster which many a 
prettier girl would envy. 

Peter showed her his card at 
once, knowing she would cooperate all she could with a 
Security Officer. She did. She 
invited them into a surprisingly 
expensive -looking lounge with 
every evidence of excitement. 

"I don't want to disappoint 
you, Miss Ball," said Peter. 
"We're not here about your application to go to Murrane. That's 
not my department at all. We 
want to ask you some questions 
about your father and — Lorna." 

She was disappointed; it was 
inevitable. Apparently she had 
set her mind on going to Murrane. 
She blinked and smiled brightly, 
but Muriel wasn't deceived. She 
patted Barbara's knee sympathetically. 

"Pity you and I can't do a 
switch, Barbara," she sai'd. "You 
want to go to Murrane, and everybody's trying to make me go 
there, but I don't want to." 

"Careful, Muriel," said Peter 
quietly. "No, it's not that we 
don't trust you, Miss Sail. But 
there may be something very important behind this ..." 

He put some questions about 
Dr. Ball and Lorna. Dr. Ball, it 
seemed, was about fifty, and had 
been a medical doctor for some 
time before he heard of electronic 
psychiatry. He'd moved into that 



34 




 



branch right at the beginning, and 
soon, with Dr. Hyneker, was the 
leading authority on it. He went 
to Murrane because, he said, on 
Earth you couldn't see the trees 
for the forest. The environment 
of a psychiatrist's patients was 
so complicated that he could never see the effect of any one item. 
In a colony, life was so comparatively simple that it was possible 
to trace things, really cure things 
which on Earth could only be 
alleviated. He had started his 
own school there, experimenting 
and training electronic psychiatrists. 

"You seem to know the background pretty well, Miss Ball," 
said Peter. 

CHE shook her head impatient ^ ly. "I'm the dunce of the family," she said. 

Lorna had also been at school 
in New York, but five years ago, 
when Barbara was fourteen, she 
had gone to Murrane. Barbara 
had been left in the general 
charge of an aunt — actually, on 
her own. 

"Pop believes in people having 
to look after themselves early," 
said Barbara. 

Lorna had been brilliant. At 
school and college she had done 
pretty well in everything, refusing to specialize. She did enough 
electronic psychiatry to know her 
way around the subject, but only 



from the psychological side. She 
kept off medicine and concentrated on chemistry. 

Peter stopped Barbara when 
she was in the middle of her description of Lorna. 

"Have you a picture?" he 
asked. 

"Of Lorna? Sure, on the table 
beside you.*' 

Peter looked at it closely. It 
was rather a shock, in two ways. 
He passed it on to Muriel, who 
merely glanced at it casually and 
put it back on the table. 

Apparently Peter's idea wasn't 
going to strike Muriel at all. 

"Miss Ball," he said slowly, 
"let's suppose that on Murrane 
for some reason Lorna was 
changed physically so that she 
became completely different — so 
that appearance was nothing to 
go by. Suppose all her personal 
memories were removed, so that 
she didn't know anything that 
had ever happened to her, anyone she had ever met. But suppose also that her general knowledge, the memories that had 
nothing to do with Lorna Ball 
personally, were carefully split 
off and only lightly covered up. 
Supposing all that — how would 
you know that Muriel here wasn't 
your sister Lorna?" 

Muriel wasn't much affected 
by the idea Peter suggested one 
way or the other. 

But Barbara jumped, went 



MIND ALONE 



35 



white, and stared at Muriel. 

"She can't be . . ." she murmured. "Lorna's no glamor girl. 
And she — " 

She was troubled by the two 
things that Peter had noticed 
about the picture. Lorna wasn't 
ugly, but at best she was merely 
a pleasant -looking girl. One 
would say she looked intelligent, 
which was true, and avoid altogether the question of whether 
she was pretty or not. 

The other thing was that Lorna 
and Muriel were so obviously 
different, beauty apart, that one 
didn't look for similarities. It 
was like comparing an orange 
and an apple. Girls much more 
like each other would still have 
been obviously different people. 

Barbara, though she called 
herself the dunce of the family, 
wasn't stupid. And she had imagination. Her gifts seemed to lie 
all in that direction, in fact. She 
was an artist born to a scientist: 
the intelligence was there, but 
instead of being calculating intelligence it was talent, apparently. 
A volume of Beethoven sonatas 
lay on the piano; the watercolors hung on the walls were 
probably hers, and Peter wouldn't 
have been surprised to learn she 
wrote, too. 

Barbara soon got over the 
plain difficulties of the matter 
and began to consider the question seriously. 



CHE asked Muriel questions on 
^ subjects Lor.na knew, and apparently threw in a few on subjects Lorna didn't know. Presently, her own knowledge being 
deficient, she armed herself with 
an encyclopedia. Muriel wasn't 
often sure; she usually answered 
hesitantly. Sometimes Barbara 
helped her, giving part of the 
answer to see if Muriel could 
supply the rest. As a rule she 
could. 

Barbara naturally enough tried 
for other memories now and 
then — people Lorna had known, 
things she had done, places she 
had visited. Sometimes something 
came out about the places, but 
nothing on the other things. 

"Have you a scar on your left 
thigh?" Barbara asked. 

"I don't think so." 

"Marks like that wouldn't be 
left," Peter put in. "There would 
be no point in the other changes, 
if Lorna could be identified by a 
simple thing like a scar." 

Nevertheless, Muriel rolled 
down her stocking and Barbara 
looked closely at the skin. There 
was a very faint mark which 
might have been a scar. 

"They didn't make it easy for 
us, did they?" asked Muriel, 
amused . She was still far less 
concerned about the whole affair 
than Peter and Barbara. 

' 'Don't you care ?" Barbara 
asked. 




 



"Of course I care, but — well, 
after all, I must be someone. It 
doesn't seem to matter such a 
tremendous amount who I am, if 
you see what I mean. If I'm Lorna Ball, fine. If not, I won't be 
heartbroken." 

Barbara looked at Muriel's 
teeth. 

A back tooth was missing that 
Barbara didn't know about. 

"Perhaps there was something 
unusual about it," suggested 
Peter. 

"There was," Barbara said, 
with some evidence of excitement. 
"It was the only one that was 
filled. Either Loma got it out 
since, or they took it out because 
it could be identified from dental 
photographs — " 

"Then you're certain I'm 
Lorna?" 

"No, not certain Whoever did 
this made sure I couldn't be certain. There's nothing conclusive. 
You don't know things Lorna 
definitely did know. You do 
know things Lorna hadn't studied, to my knowledge. But allowing for all that — I think you're 
my sister." 

TIT URIEL said slowly, "Even if 
1TJ. i wanted to go to Murrane 
I couldn't.'* 

"Perhaps you could," said 
Peter quietly, watching her closely. 

"How?" 



"Through Security. The route 
Barbara has been trying to take." 

Muriel looked at Barbara. "If 
they won't let her go, why should 
they let me?" 

It was Barbara who answered 
that. "If you're Lorna," she said, 
"they'll let you go. Terran agents 
have to know Murrane and be 
able to act like Murriners. They 
don't think I can. They've tested 
me twice. I'm quiet, dreamy and 
even-tempered, and I should be 
reckless, hasty and extrovert, or 
able to act that way." She frowned, then admitted honestly: "I 
can't, I guess. But you're different. Try Security and see." 

Muriel fought a sharp, silent 
battle with herself. She could be 
quite happy without ever knowing for sure who she was — and it 
would be dangerous to go to Murrane as a spy. She didn't think 
of it as more than that: dangerous. She was quite confident of 
being able to pass among Murriners as one of them — it seemed 
like the kind of thing she could 
do. 

But why? 

Why take such a risk when it 
didn't matter? She didn't really 
care much about what had been 
done to her. She didn't want revenge. And she still trembled inwardly at the thought of going to 
Murrane. 

Yet what really mattered 
seemed to be this: she did want 



MIND ALONE 



to know more. This was a way 
in which she might learn. 

"Peter," she said abruptly, "am 
I free? Do you trust me? Do I 
have to go to Murrane?" 

Peter took her hand and pressed it affectionately. 

"Let's take them in order, 
baby," he said. "Are you free? 
Sure. You have always been. 
Perhaps Security should be as 
tough as it's supposed to be, and 
kill on suspicion. But it isn't. 
Maybe that's why we're losing 
the war. It gives the benefit of 
the doubt, and you know there's 
so much doubt that Security 
can't ever touch you. Do I trust 
you? That's not so easy. Trust 
has to be both ways. If you trust 
me, maybe you can see the answer to that." 

Muriel returned the pressure 
warmly. "I like that," she said. 
"I always knew you were a nice 
guy, Peter, even when you were 
acting like a screen villain. Only 
a good guy would say a thing 
like that. But you didn't answer 
the last question." 

"Do you have to go to Murrane? No ... I didn't. Only you 
can answer that, Muriel." 

X 

"|^OOD luck, Muriel," said 
^ r Peter. "And— -come back, 
will you?" 

Muriel had let him kiss her 



before, but this time she kissed 
him. Then she left the helicopter 
and struck out for the distant 
glow of the city. 

She was a little light-headed. 
She was deliberately not thinking of her fear of going to Murrane, and the fact that she was 
now on it. There was also the 
danger that would be with her 
every second of the time she was 
on the world: the danger of being discovered as a Terran spy. 
And, curiously, the two fears 
seemed to cancel each other out. 

The ship which had brought 
her would stay in the vicinity. 
She didn't know where — she 
hadn't been told, in case she 
should be discovered and interrogated. Peter and Barbara were 
aboard it, and every three days 
Peter would drop in the helicopter to the same spot to see if she 
were ready to go back yet or had 
anything to report. 

The ship wouldn't be discovered. A single ship could seldom 
be detected in space, unless it 
was moving fast. Almost all the 
devices for detecting the presence 
of other spaceships were based 
on the increase of mass with velocity. The faster a ship went, 
the more chance it had of getting 
through a waiting fleet — and the 
more certain it was to be detected. The slower it went, the safer 
it was from detection of that 
kind; but if it should be spotted 




 



by eyes or radar it was a dead 
duck, with no acceleration built 
up. 

No, Muriel's line of escape was 
safe enough; all the danger was 
on Murrane itself. 

It was the beginning of the long 
night of Murrane, and she had 
been landed between Felter and 
Ederton. The answers she wanted 
were probably all to be found in 
Rillan, a hundred and fifty miles 
to the south, but she hadn't dared 
go there at once. For all she 
knew, perhaps everyone in Rillan 
would recognize her. 

A S she walked, she pondered 
about how familiar this world 
was to her. She had had the normal training of any Terran who 
was sent to Murrane as a spy, 
yet she hadn't been thinking of 
that when she was careful not to 
touch the low branches of the 
Murriner pines. No, there was no 
doubt that she was familiar with 
Murrane. It had*" been obvious 
during her training by Security. 

She didn't think anything had 
been said about Murriner pines 
at night in the training she had 
had from Security. Murrane had 
once been warmer; many of its' 
plants spent their lives grasping 
for heat, from any source. Any 
animal or man who blundered 
into a pine, particularly, was 
liable to be clutched and held, if 
he wasn't strong and nimble, and 



drained of his body heat. He 
might be alive at morning, if he 
had enough vitality; but probably not. Certainly not if the 
morning was thirty-eight hours 
away. 

She walked on through the 
hard snow, adjusting herself. to 
the environment. Murrane's three 
moons, all of them risen at the 
moment, gave about the same illumination as a full moon on 
Earth. 

She wore a black snowsuit, 
plain but neatly cut. It covered 
everything but her face, hands 
and feet. On her feet were furlined boots; long gloves covered 
her hands and the sleeves of her 
suit. Under the snowsuit she 
wore a similar but finer white 
coverall, and under that a thin 
sweater and pantaloons. All this 
would come off when she went 
inside. Below this was the indoor 
dress, creaseless slacks and a 
sweater. Any sins of the flesh 
committed on Murrane weren't 
caused by seeing too much of it. 

She stopped as a call sounded 
behind her. She wasn't frightened; she was rather glad that her 
first meeting with a Murriner 
should be like this, alone, in the 
open, at night. Women on Murrane had nothing to fear from 
such encounters — the penalties 
for all kinds of sex crime were 
too severe. 

She couldn't see any more of 



MIND ALONE 



the man who came up to her 
than he could of her — a few 
square inches of face above a 
bulky figure. 

"Oh — a girl!" he exclaimed in 
some surprise. "You're late on 
this road, aren't you?" 

Already there were slight physical changes; soon there would 
be a distinctive Murriner accent, 
then a dialect. There was no 
radio communication between 
Earth and Murrane, of course, 
nor would there ever be. That 
meant that any change in pronunciation would be a divergence. 

"Yes, I'm later than I meant to 
be," said Muriel, in the same accent. "I thought I'd make Felter 
an hour ago." 

They walked on together. 

"Looking for a job?" asked the 
Murriner. 

Terran Intelligence, poor as it 
was, could at least be trusted to 
give its operatives a sound identity and purpose. "Yes," said Muriel, "they need chemists at the 
factory.*' 

"Where are you from?" 

"Rillan," she told him. 

"Why leave Rillan for a little 
place like this?" 

"Rillan's gone all psychiatric 
and biological. This looks as if 
it's going to be the place for 
chemists." 

"You're smart," said the Murriner, after considering that. 
"What's your name?" 



Muriel gave him her third identity — Thelma Bittner. 

"Glad to meet you. I'm Bill 
Seuter. Say, I used to work in 
Rillan. They still got that old 
ship in the square?" 

Muriel turned her head to stare 
at him. "Ship? Square?" 

"Sure, the museum piece. Used 
to pass it every day." 

CHE hadn't remembered much 
^ about Rillan, but a few vague 
pictures came up as he spoke. 
More than enough for her to" 
say: "Not in Rillan you didn't. 
No offense — you think I'm a Terran spy, perhaps?" 

Seuter laughed. "We check on 
anyone who arrives in a place. 
That's enough. We don't make 
many mistakes." 

" 'We'?" 

"I'm in Counter-espionage." 

"Oh. You check on people even 
before they get to Felter?" 

"Sometimes. I don't follow any 
fixed routine," said Seuter complacently, "but I don't miss 
much. You're all right. When we 
get where it's warmer, remind me 
and I'll give you a CE pass for 
Felter." 

* Security didn't know anything 
about CE passes. 

"Thanks," said Muriel. "But, 
say . . . how could you tell Fm 
all right? Just because I know 
there's no ship in the square at 
Rillan?" 



40 




 



"Nope," said Seuter, still complacent. "Fact is, Earth and Murrane are growing apart every 
minute. I don't need to run lab 
tests on you, even if I knew how. 
T alking for five minutes is 
enough." 

He would be right, too, Muriel 
t bought — except with someone 
like her who had actually lived 
on Murrane. 

"Find many?" she asked. 

"Three a month. I spend a lot 
of time on roads outside towns 
and pick up people like you." 

They had reached the town. No 
snow lay there ; Murrane- had 
only electric power, but there was 
any amount of that. It was because there was only electric 
power that people had to do so 
much walking between towns. 
Electric power wasn't much good 
for the heavy vehicles that would 
be needed to force their way 
through the drifts and ice, and 
instead, an electric railway system was being gradually extended, Muriel hadn't had to explain 
that she had gone by train from 
Rillan to Ederton and walked on 
to Felter — that would be taken 
for granted. 

Seuter gave her a pass, saluted 
her with a wave of his hand and 
went back to patrol the roadway. 
Muriel looked after him thoughtfully. Because of him, three Terrans would be identified and shot 
in the next month or so. But he 



was only doing his job, and doing 
it well. She liked him. Sometimes 
one met someone for only a few 
minutes, said only a few words 
and then parted, but felt as if 
one had made a friend. It was 
like that with Seuter. 

She hoped desperatejy that she 
would find what she was looking 
for, and that it would end this 
senseless war. Surely if it could 
only be stopped soon Earth 
would have the sense never to 
make the same mistakes again, 
whatever they were , and Murrane would know better than to 
fight a war for freedom that had 
never really been denied. 

Suddenly she realized that she 
hadn't been afraid since she set 
foot on Murrane. 

XI 

SHE got the job. On Murrane, 
so far, there was no system 
of qualifications and references. 
They tried you in a job, and if 
you did it well, you were in. 

In the first few days she saw 
how easy it was for anyone who 
knew Murrane well to pass as a 
Murriner, and how utterly impossible it was for anyone who 
didn't. 

The physical differences were 
nothing — absolutely nothing. 
What mattered was whether you 
were a Murriner or not. Earth 
was flooding Murrane with op


MIND ALONE

eratives who weren't, and they 
stood out like sore thumbs. Muriel saw one of them. She couldn't 
do anything about him. He was 
obviously being left alone for the 
moment, carefully watched, no 
doubt, to see what he would do. 

How could Security hope to 
train agents? What they needed 
wasn't the right knowledge, but 
the right attitude. That couldn't 
be learned in New York. 

She met Seuter again a few 
days later at the factory. He was 
there checking on the other new 
chemists. 

"Say!" he said when he saw 
her, "if f'd seen more of you that 
night I'd have stayed with you 
longer." 

"I thought so too," she admitted frankly. "I'm not usually 
dropped as quickry as that." 

"Why aren't you married?" he 
asked bluntly. 

"Because I*m a chemist. 
There's no romance in chemistry." 

"There's one chemist I could 
go for." 

She held up her hand in protest. "No," she said, "not a CE 
man. Someone will shoot you 
some day. I'm not going to marry anyone who's going to be 
shot." 

But that raised another problem. In frontier country there are 
always more men than women. 
The women on Murrane were 



very quickly married. At twentyfive, on Murrane, a healthy, pretty girl who was unmarried was 
an enigma to everyone. Muriel 
would have to do her job in a 
hurry, before anyone became 
puzzled enough to be suspicious. 

Every three days, she knew, 
Peter was landing his little shell 
of a helicopter in the same spot 
to take her away if she was ready. 

Ready! She hadn't even started. 

Working on the basis that the 
secret she was looking for was 
psychiatric or anthropological, 
she studied the Murriners around 
her not individually but in the 
mass. Nothing suggested itself. 
They were different from Terrans, 
of course, but such differences as 
she saw were known or guessed 
on Earth. 

THEY were aggressive -defensive, as Peter had once said. 
They boasted of how much better 
they were than Terrans, and se-. 
cretly believed the opposite. 
They were reckless, brave, with 
a fine disregard for male life. 
Women weren't allowed to be 
brave, however. They were too 
valuable for the young Murriners 
they could produce. Murriners in 
general were less intelligent than 
Terrans, more ready to take 
chances, more quarrelsome, more 
immature, more generous, more 
vital. 




 



But all that was known. What 
vas it that wasn't known? 

She saw nothing of anyone who 
vas actually engaged in fighting 
-no space -navyrnen, no ammunition dumps, no military depots, 
or, in fact, anything whatever 
t h at was connected with the war. 
She was very careful not to. That 
vas bound to be a dangerous line 
> >f investigation. The regular Teri an agents would be working on 
t hat problem, and succeeding 
moderately or failing completely, 
as usual. 

She was pretty certain, moreover, that what she wanted 
wasn't to be found under the 
heading of normal military information. 

Only when others introduced 
the subject did she even talk 
about the war. The usual attitude was about what she expected. Her fellow-workers had no 
very clear idea of what was going 
on, or why it was going on; but 
they were naturally, temperamentally in favor of a war against 
Earth. To most of them, the issue was plain — Murrane was 
teaching Earth a lesson. Earth 
was being shown that you 
couldn't push Murriners around. 
They knew, most of them, that 
there was more to it than that. 
But that was policy — none of 
their business. 

After two weeks of merely being an ordinary Murriner chem


ist, Muriel decided that she 
would have to risk visiting Rillan. Dr. Hyneker was probably 
right. The secret would be there. 
It certainly didn't appear to be 
in Felter. She had seen nothing 
that seemed worthwhile even trying to follow up. 

She told Seuter she was going 
back to pick up some things. 

"Made up your mind to stay, 
baby?" he said. "Fine. I'm still 
hoping to change your mind 
about CE men." 

"You might at that," said 
Muriel encouragingly. "I haven't 
known many. And maybe it'll be 
a long time before someone 
shoots you." 

XII 

TMTURIEL was quite well aware 
that it was dangerous. Rather than scratch cautiously along 
the edges of the affair, however, 
she marched straight up to 17 
Third Street, rang the bell and 
asked the woman who came to 
the door if Dr. James Ball lived 
there. 

"Not now," said the woman, 
apparently unsuspicious. "I don't 
know where he went." 

"Can you tell me anyone who 
might?" 

The woman considered. 
"There's Joe Cruickshank at 
number 14," she said. "He used 
to be a friend of the doctor," 



MIND ALONE 



43 



Muriel thanked her and crossed the street to number 14. 

Joe Cruickshank was an oldish 
man with very heavy black 
brows. When Muriel mentioned 
Dr. Ball he drew them together 
in a dark frown, almost hiding 
his eyes. 

"You a friend of his?" he demanded. "Or maybe a friend of 
his daughter?" 

Despite the signs, ' Muriel 
thought the best answer was, 
"Yes." 

"You want to know what happened to him?" 
"And Lorna." 

He hesitated; then said abruptly, "Come in," and turned away 
without waiting to see if she was 
following him. 

There was nothing luxurious 
about the sitting-room into which 
he led her, but in a simple way it 
was very comfortable. An electric fire was set into one wall; 
otherwise it was like a sittingroom in a country cottage on 
Earth circa 1880. Cruickshank 
sat heavily on a rocking-chair 
and motioned Muriel to an armchair on the other side of the fire. 

"Who are you?" he demanded. 

Muriel didn't want to give any 
of her three names. It was still 
not proven that she was Lorna 
Ball, and in any case she clearly 
couldn't give that name. If the 
theory she was working on was 
correct, she had been named 



Muriel Martin on Murrane, probably in Rillan, and that was 
equally undesirable as a name to 
give. And though Thehtia Bittner had gone back to Rillan quite 
openly, she didn't want Thelma 
Bittner to be known as having 
shown interest in James and 
Lorna Ball. 

SO she gave a fourth name, and 
a few brief details to satisfy 
Cruickshank. She had plenty of 
information that she could use 
to prove she had known Lorna 
well. 

"And you don't know anything 
about what happened to them?" 
asked Cruickshank. 

"No. Nothing." 

"Neither does anyone else," 
said Cruickshank bitterly, apparently deciding to trust her. 
"I think they're both dead,'* 

"Dead! Why?" 

"When the war started, Jim 
wouldn't join CE. He wouldn't 
have anything to do with it, or 
the war. Well, you know what 
Jim Ball has done for Murrane. 
CE might want to shoot him or 
lock him up, but most of us here 
in Rillan had other ideas. CE 
didn't dare touch him. He went 
on working as usual, though both 
he and Lorna had to report to 
CE every second day. They 
weren't allowed to write or receive letters." 

''That's why I never got any 




 



icply!" said Muriel adroitly. 

"Jim told me one day he knew 
(he real reason for the war — " 

"Did he tell you what it was?" 

"If he had, I wouldn't be here 
now. CE shot me full of drugs 
later, and only let me go when 
they were sure I didn't know anything. Anyway, the day after Jim 
told me that he disappeared. So 
did Lorna." 

He breathed hard. "Some of us 
got together. CE may be spying 
on us and telling us what to do, 
but CE isn't Murrane. We weren't 
afraid of CE. We went along to 
the office, a whole crowd of us, 
ready to tear the place apart. But 
they fobbed us off with some 
story — told us the doctor and 
Lorna would be back in two 
weeks. So we went away." 

Cruickshank wasn't looking at 
her, but into the orange glow of 
the fire. rt They came for me that 
night and made sure I didn't 
know anything. They were polite 
enough, and I didn't make an 
issue of it. 

"Two weeks later we went back 
and they told us Jim and his 
daughter had been deported to 
Earth. We didn't believe them. 
We went all through the office, 
but there was no sign of either of 
them." 

1-iRUICKSHANK'S voice rose. 
^ "They'd been shot, that's 
why! CE knew it couldn't keep 



them prisoner — we'd have had 
them out in no time. Jim Ball 
was never against Murrane. 
Everyone knew that. Whatever 
CE had against them, or thought 
it had, it couldn't bring them to 
trial. It couldn't keep them. The 
only thing it could do was kill 
them and hide their bodies so 
that no one would ever find them.' 
Well, whoever harmed Jim Ball 
or his daughter was no true Murriner, and I don't care who .hears 
me say so! They were good 
friends to all of us!" 

He glared at Muriel as if she 
were CE itself. 

"Maybe CE told the truth," 
said Muriel. "Maybe they were 
deported.", 

"Would CE give Earth a man 
like Jim Ball, for free?" said 
Cruickshank derisively. "No, CE 
wouldn't do that. CE shot them!" 

There seemed to be very little 
more Cruickshank could tell her. 
Unless . , . 

"How did Dr. Ball look when 
he told you he knew the real 
reason for the war?" she asked. 
"Happy? Sad? Disillusioned? 
Amused?" 

"None of those. Just . . . surprised. Sort, of 'Who'd have 
thought it?' " 

That was something, she 
thought. She was practically certain, now, that she was Lorna 
Ball. 

She got one thing more from 



MIND ALONE 



45 



Joe Cruickshank — a name and 
address. It was her only lead now. 

If Cruickshank couldn't tell 
her any more, clearly the thing 
to do was to go to someone who 
could — whether he would or not. 
She didn't want the local CE 
Chief or second-in-command. 
They would be too important, 
too well-guarded perhaps. They 
might also be too clever or too 
fanatic. So she had asked for the 
name of the man who rated about 
third. He must know the secret, 
and there was a better chance 
that he would be easy to get to. 

The man was Edward Voigt, 
27 Seventh Street. 

She advised Cruickshank, as 
she left, to forget that he had 
ever seen her; but he wasn't curious. He was sunk in his anger 
at what he believed had happened to Jim and Lorna Ball. 

XIII 

VOIGT seemed to have been a 
good choice. His home was no 
bigger than Cruickshank's, and 
Muriel was inside it, standing in 
the doorway of the kitchen, waiting. She had had to break a catch 
on a bedroom window, but it was 
already dark and she was sure no 
one had seen her. 

She had planned carefully; no 
further planning would help 
much. Peter would land outside 
Felter that night — she had to 



catch the train in two hours* time 
if she didn't mean to wait three 
days more. She wasn't optimistic 
enough to expect to have the information she wanted when the 
ship picked her up, but she meant 
to take this chance of getting it — 
and if she failed she'd have to 
leave Murrane anyway. 

Surely Voigt must come soon. 
He lived alone, apparently. 
Muriel had her gun nn her hand, 
silenced. She stood in the dark, 
alert for the first sound of anyone 
entering. 

At first she had been afraid he 
would come home too soon, for 
she couldn't leave Rillan until 
the train went, and it would be 
dangerous to wait anywhere. But 
as the time slowly passed, she 
began to fear that he wouldn't 
come home at all, or would be 
too late for her to do what she 
wanted to do and still catch the 
train. 

She had wound her scarf round 
her face. Very likely Voigt had 
seen her before. He would know 
when he saw her that she was 
Muriel Martin, who had been 
Lorna Ball. And he would know 
many more things which Muriel 
herself didn't know. She probed 
her mind for anything she knew 
of Voigt, but there was nothing. 
There was still that curious division. Many things in Rillan were 
quite familiar to her, but she remembered nothing that had ever 



46 




 



Kjppened there. She must have 
nown Joe Cruickshank once, but 
was as much a stranger to her 
is she was to him. 
At last, a key scraped in the 
■ck. Muriel tensed. The next few 
minutes would not only mean 
success or failure, but perhaps, 
quite independent of that, life or 
< leath. She wasn't sorry she had 
chosen this way, however. At last 
■the was going to be face to face 
with someone who knew what she 
wanted. 

There was a step in the vestibule, then the light clicked on. 
Muriel stepped in from the kitchen as Voigt closed the other 
door, and he saw her at once. 

"If you make a sound," said 
Muriel softly, "I'll shoot to kill." 

VOIGT gasped. Muriel had expected he would be a young 

man, ambitious, a future local 
CE Chief. But he Was old, and 
had probably climbed as high in 
the organization as he would ever 
go. She rejoiced; that was better 
still. 

"Do you want to live, Voigt?" 
she asked. "I want information. 
If you give it, no one need know 
I got it from you. If you don't, I 
kill you and get it from someone 
else." 

"You're a Terranl" Voigt exclaimed. 

She pulled aside her scarf. 
"Do you know now. why I'm 



here?" she asked quietly. 

He went white. "Muriel Martin," he breathed, but she caught 
the note of interrogation he 
couldn't keep out of it. 

"Lorna Ball," she said evenly. 

"But you can't know! They 
told us — " 

"As you see, I do know." She 
was trying to say as little as 
possible that might reveal the 
limitations of her knowledge. 
"Now, Voigt, do I get what I 
want, or do I shoot?" 

Suddenly he stiffened. "Yes, 
get it over with. You'd never let 
me live." 

That was unfortunate. She apparently had good reasons for 
killing him. Voigt knew them, 
and she didn't. "For what I once 
knew, I may," she said. "What 
was it that was so important you 
had to kill my father?" 

"I didn't! You're only guessing" 

"Keep your voice down," she 
murmured. From the frantic way 
he talked, how he had looked 
when he recognized her, and the 
way he had said "You'd never let 
me live," she was almost certain 
that her father was dead, and 
that Voigt was the man who had 
actually killed him. It was a piece 
of bad luck if Voigt was the 
killer. Having no recollection of 
her father she felt no urge to 
revenge, but Voigt would never 
believe that. Her threat was 



MIND ALONE 



47 



weakened because he believed he 
must die anyway. 

"Listen," she said. "I give you 
my word that if you tell me, 
I'll tie you up and leave you unhurt. What did my father find 
out?" 

He was frightened, and she was 
playing on that. A brave man 
would have laughed at her, and 
she would have been helpless. 

"I don't know," Voigt said 
desperately. "I didn't understand 
it. It was too complicated." 

Muriel shook her head. "Complicated things aren't that important. This is simple. You can 
tell me in one sentence," 

She saw that he could. He 
was easy to read. She forced herself to be patient. She ought to 
be able to get what she wanted 
from a man as scared of death 
as Voigt was. 

"I don't like the idea of torture," she said, "but maybe it's 
the only thing you understand. 
If I shot you two or three times 
in the stomach, you*d probably 
want me to finish you off. Would 
you rather be begging for life or 
begging for death?" 

TIE clutched the back of a 
chair to hold himself up. "We 
let you go," he said piteously. 

"You can hardly expect me to 
be grateful. Well, what's it to 
be?" 

"It's mutation," he said, his 



nerve gone. The words came out 
cracked, almost unrecognizable. 
"Once we've mutated, we can't 
mutate again. We can only go 
back to Earth. We're prisoners 
here, we can't expand, we can't — " 

By a strange quirk of emotion, 
he recovered his courage the instant it was too late. He flung 
himself at Muriel, his modth 
opening to shout. She shot him in 
the shoulder, thinking it would 
stop him. Instead, it made him 
wild. He thought he was dying, 
apparently, and rushed forward 
to take Muriel with him. Muriel 
shot for his legs, but he was 
pitching forward to dive at her 
knees and took the little bullet 
full in the top of his head. He 
crumpled like an old suit. 

Curiously, Muriel was appalled. It didn't seem to matter 
that he had killed her father 
and would have killed her if he'd 
reached her. She had talked grimly of shooting him in the stomach, 
yet she was horrified at the 
thought that she had killed him. 
She bent for a moment beside 
him in the futile hope that a man 
with a bullet through his brain 
could be merely stunned, not 
dead. 

But then what he had said 
drove other considerations from 
her mind for the moment. 

There must have been a weakness, after all, in the job CE had 
done on her. For she knew at 



4ft 




 



nee that what Voigt had said 
vas true — and her mind leaped 
lie gap of forgetfulness to wide, 
irsighted conclusions that it 
nust have reached once before. 

She needed no more. She understood. She had no proof, but 
■ lie knew she could get it. 
There was a limit to the powers 
f adaptation of those intensely 
idaptable creatures, human bengs. They would go to a new 
world and make it their home, 
and in doing, so they would 
change to meet the new conditions — a little or a lot, it didn't 
matter. They would always have 
to do that, for no world would 
t vef be quite the same as Earth. 
And having changed, they lost 
some of the power to change 
again. They could go back — 
Earth itself would always be a 
refuge to them, a refuge from 
which, eventually, they could go 
out anew to other worlds, their 
power of adaptation restored. 

But Murrane was the Murriners' prison. Cut off from Earth, 
they could never live freely, naturally, on any world but their 
own. And the Murriners, almost 
exclusively, were restless, unsatisfied, hot-blooded pioneers. 

The very thought of encirclement restriction, would be enough 
to make any Murriner fight his 
shadow, let alone the world that 
held the key to freedom. 
It was as simple as that. 



TIER preoccupation with the 
fact that she had killed a 
man was almost her undoing at 
the station. She didn't even notice the CE man staring at her 
closely until he spoke to her. 

"Where are you going?" he demanded. 

She brought her attention back 
with a jerk. It would be tragic 
to be discovered now. 

"Ederton— for Felter," she said, 
and fumbled in her pocket. She 
gave him Seuter's pass. 

"What have you been doing 
here?" 

"I've been visiting a relative." 

"Who?" 

She couldn't give Joe Cruickshank's name. In a few hours, 
they would find the whole story 
'and shoot him as a traitor. 

"Ted Voigt," she said boldly. 

"Oh." His face relaxed. But 
he put one more question to make 
sure. "What kind of clock has he 
on the mantel?" 

Muriel laughed. "There isn't a 
mantel. There's an alarm clock 
on a little table. Tlie floorcloth's 
green and white squares." And 
Voigt's lying on it, she thought. 
"The curtains are dark green and 
in one corner — " 

"All right," said the CE man. 
"There's your train." 

FROM the moment the train 
reached Ederton onwards, 
Muriel was really terrified, for the 



MIND ALONE 




so 




 



tirst time since she had landed on 
Murrane. Now that she was so 
near leaving the planet, all the 
anxiety and nervousness and fear 
lie might have felt before, but 
ladn't, seemed to pile up in one 
[ idal wave of terror. She was 
alternately cold and hot. Her legs 
it emed about to give way and 
pitch her forward in the snow. 
She saw no one on the road, but 
;he was sure that if she looked 
behind she would see a mob at 
her heels. 

When she reached the arranged 
spot and waited, she forgot all 
about the Murriner pines, and 
was pulled against the trunk of 
one before she even noticed the 
questing branch. 

Other branches swung slowly 
towards her to trap her inextricably, and already she felt the 
chill of the trunk against her 
back. She fought wildly with the 
branches that closed tightly 
across her body, crushing her ribs. 
The only way out was under — 
she got both arms against a 
branch and forced herself down, 
straining to tear her snowsuit because it was firmly caught. Very 
slowly it gave, and branches 
rasped over her chest. 

She slid to the ground, her arms 
still trapped above her head, and 
tried to dig her heels into the 
ground to drag herself clear. The 
snow gave no purchase. 

She relaxed completely, and 



after a few long seconds the 
branches above her slackened 
very slightly. She waited, gathering her strength, then suddenly 
threw herself away from the tree 
with a heave of shoulders and 
legs. Her hands came free. 

Muriel got to her feet and stood 
gulping for air, laughing weakly 
when she found that instead of 
having two or three ribs broken, 
as had seemed likely, she wasn't 
even scratched. Her heavy clothing had taken the brunt of the 
damage. 

But she hoped Peter would 
hurry up, for she was wet through 
and the freezing air was getting 
inside her torn clothes. The 
numbness in her side wasn't a 
wound — it was the cold air of 
Murrane sucking warmth from 
her skin. 

As a dark shape dropped from 
the slightly less dark sky, she 
fell on the snow in a faint.

1VT URIEL awoke in bed aboard 
the ship, warm, dry and 
comfortable- — and obviously safe. 
She remembered dimly saying, 
"Peter, I killed a man!" and 
Peter's cheerful, unexpected reply, "Good for you." 

He was sitting on the bed now. 

"You didn't put me to bed, 
did you?" she gasped. 

He grinned and nodded across

her. Muriel turned and saw Barbara, sitting and watching her. 

"Hallo, Barbara," she said. "I 
am your sister." 

"I know it." 

"Dr. Ball" — it didn't seem natural to call him anything else — 
"Dr. Ball is dead." 

Barbara nodded. "I guess I 
knew that too." 

"I killed the man who did it, 
if that's any comfort. I didn't 
mean to do it." 

There was a silence, and she 
knew they were wailing to hear 
whether she had succeeded or 
failed. 

"Yes, I got what I was looking 
for." she said. She told them. 

Peter, she saw, found it very 
difficult to understand. He 
couldn't quite see the process, or 
what it meant, or how it could 
be so important. Most particularly he couldn't see why this, 
known only to Murrane's CE~ 
organization, should make them 
goad their people on to fight 
Earth. 

"Surely the effect would be 
just the opposite," he said. 
"Wouldn't they try to straighten 
out the differences with Earth 
that already- existed, so that they 
could — " 

Muriel had been watching Barbara. "You understand, Barbara, 
don't you?" she said. 

"I think so," Barbara said slowly. "It's like this, Peter. Think 



of a man and woman crossing a 
tropical desert back on Earth. 
The man's stronger — he carries 
the water and supplies. And after 
long, scorching days of travel, 
the woman thinks, Suppose he 
goes on and leaves me while I'm 
asleep? She knows she'll die of 
thirst. She doesn't dare ask to 
carry some of the water, for the 
man may refuse. She may put 
the idea of leaving her into his 
mind. So after days of this, out of 
her fear, she takes the water from 
the man while he's asleep and 
goes on alone. Perhaps she kills 
him too, to make sure. Do you 
see?" 

TIMURIEL nodded. "That's it. 
-L" CE is naturally suspicious, 
Peter — like some of Earth's Security Officers. It finds that 
Murrane is dependent on Earth. 
Murriners can't colonize forthemselves, can't do anything but stay 
in their own hard, cold world, except with Earth's gracious permission — and colonists are the 
most independent human beings 
in the Galaxy. They won't ask 
for anything they think they 
might be able to take. So CE, 
knowing this, sets the Murriners, 
who are always ready for a fight, 
at Earth. Make Earth ask for 
terms, and demand a slice of 
Earth itself, where Murriners 
can — " 

"Yes, I see that," said Peter,

" coming excited. "But this 
<ans — " 

"The end of the war, anyway. 

E always knew that. 2 expect 
:cy guarded this secret in the 

>pe that they'd get what they 
;inted before we found out what 
1 1 was. And beyond that — " 

Peter jumped up. "I'll get us to 
■■- curity HQ on the double!" 

He was gone. 

Muriel smiled wryly, and BarUira, seeing her smile, grinned 
loo. "I'm afraid he's forgotten 
ubout you, Lorna," she said teasingly. "He's become a Security 
man again." 

"Don't call me Lorna," said 
Muriel. "I stopped being Lorna 
when they took away my memories." 

"Couldn't you ever get them 
back?" 

"No. You could tell me what 
happened, and I'd believe you. 
But I'd only be remembering 
what you told me, not what happened. I'm used to being Muriel 
Martin now — I'd rather stay that 
way." 

Presently Barbara murmured, 
"Science is often like that — expecting something until something else proves to be true. Isn't 
evolution supposed to increase 
range of adaptability, not diminish it?" 

"True — yet we can't extract 
enough oxygen from water with 
the lungs we have now, which 



our ancestors may have done 
once. No, that's not the important 
thing about this, Barbara. Can't 
you see it? 

"Nature often seems to have 
thought of situations that happen to us, long before they happen. When we're fighting and 
killing each other, more children 
are always born than at any other 
time. And nature even seems to 
have allowed for nuclear weapons. People exposed to hard radiation just don't have children, 
if they would be monsters. If 
children are born, they're all 
right. If we find out from the 
genes that they wouldn't be all 
right, we don't have to sterilize 
anybody, for they're sterilized already. Hard on the individual, 
sometimes, but excellent for the 
race. 

"Now look at this. Human beings stretching out to the stars 
and adapting, necessarily, to survive in different conditions. No 
difficulty in that. They adapt 
easily and logically. 

"But now it seems that the hurman race will always be tied to 
the world that produced them. 
Isn't that wise, too? There will 
be many worlds, many different 
peoples, some a lot more different from us than the Murriners. 
But it's still a unit, not a lot of 
units. The different peoples are 
all bound, not to each other, 
but to Earth. It's like the spokes

of a wheel. No matter what quarrels there will be — and there will 
still be quarrels — nature keeps 
mankind in one unit." 

She looked around for a wrap. 
"I'm all right. I want to get up." 

OEOPLE were rarely kept in 
bed to rest now, when they 
wanted to be active. The jpatient 
was at last accepted as the best 
authority on what was good for 
hirn — or her. Barbara produced 
a pink lace negligee. 

"That will do nicely/' she said, 
"if your Security man manages 
to get over one kind of excitement 
and comes looking for another." 

Laughing, Muriel protested. 

Barbara grinned at her. "You 
needn't be so restrained," she 
said. "I've talked with him often 
enough to know you're in no 
danger of losing his respect. For 
a Security Officer, he's all right. 
Nail him, Muriel." 

"I still want a nice respectable 
dressing-gown." 

Barbara sighed and produced 
one. Muriel got out of bed, steady 
enough despite a slight heaviness 
of head and a burning sensation 
where the pine branches had 
scraped her ribs. She put on the 
wrap, and when she turned Barbara was gone. 

Suppose, she thought, amused, 
that after all this I shouldn't want 
Peter? People were taking it 
pretty much for granted. But she 



certainly didn't mean to marry t 
anyone until she felt a little more ■ 
stable in her environment again, \ 
bolstered up by memories and 
friends and security. Not even 
Peter. 

There was a knock on the door. 
"Wait," she called peremptorily. 

"I'm sorry, Muriel," came 
Peter's voice. "I know I forgot all 
about you for a moment." 

Too many people rushed into 
marriage. If Peter did ask her, 
she would think it out very carefully, as a scientist should, taking her time. She would weigh 
all the advantages and disadvantages, and she would make very 
sure that she and Peter were 
right for each other before she 
would ... 

"You must admit," said Peter, 
"that I only neglected you for 
something pretty big. You told 
me so yourself." 

She picked up the lace wrap 
to throw it out of sight. It wasn't 
that she thought there was anything wrong with it, she admitted 
to herself. She just didn't have 
the nerve to wear a thing like 
that. 
"Please," said Peter. 

She threw off her dressinggown and slipped into the pink 
wrap. It settled on her like a 
cloud of perfumed mist. 

"Come in, Peter," she said.
