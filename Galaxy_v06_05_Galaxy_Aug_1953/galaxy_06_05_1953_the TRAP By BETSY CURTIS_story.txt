the TRAP By BETSY CURTIS 

OLD Miss Barbara Noble 
twitched aside the edge 
of the white scrim curtain to get a better look at the 
young man coming down the 
street. He might be the one. 

The young man bent a little 
under the weight of the battered 
black suitcase as he crossed Maple and started up Prospect on 
Miss Noble's side. She could see 
him set the case down on the 



wide porch of the Raney house 
and wipe his forehead with a 
handkerchief. Then she lost sight 
of him as he advanced to the 
door. He could be a visitor to the 
Raney's, but they were out of 
town on vacation. He could be 
a salesman. 

Miss Barbara shifted her rocker to the other side of the window 
where she could watch without 
having to disturb the curtain. 



This second-floor sitting room 
made an excellent lookout. She 
quickly scanned the street in the 
other direction, but there was 
no sign of movement in the hot 
sunlight. She settled down to 
watch the black suitcase sitting 
uncommunicatively at the edge of 
the porch. 

It must have been all of two 
minutes before the young man 
appeared from under the overhanging roof and picked up the 
case. A persistent fellow. He went 
down to the sidewalk and approached her own house, came 
up on her own front doorstep, 
tried to set the case down on the 
narrow stoop, couldn't, straightened up and rang the bell. A 
raucous buzz filled the sitting 
room. 

T> ARBARA Noble leaned toward the window, pulled 
back the curtain a scant inch, 
and studied his back as he looked 
at the windows on the other side 
of the front door. Limp yellow 
hair and a big perspiration stain 
in the middle of a dark sport 
shirt were her chief impressions. 
He could be a bona fide salesman 
working hard at it. She wouldn't 
let him in, of course ; but she felt 
a little sorry for him -lugging that 
big case around in this weather. 
Then he turned and looked 
straight at the window behind 
which she was hiding, and she 



let the curtain go suddenly. Had 
he seen it move? The buzzer 
sounded again, imperiously. 

Miss Barbara got up stiffly, 
moved to the big vizer screen in 
the nearest corner, and switched 
it on. The man might have something interesting and she couldn't 
get out to shop the way she used 
to. She smoothed her lilac housedress and left the room to descend 
the stairs to the front door. 

In the tiny front hall she hesitated, then opened the door inward about eight inches. Deftly 
the man stuck the broad brown 
toe of his shoe into the opening 
and looked down at her. She grinned as she saw his. expression of 
shock. 

She was old, really old. Her 
sparse white hair was pulled so 
tightly into a knob on top of her 
head that the plentiful wrinkles 
on her forehead and around her 
eyes seemed to run vertically, 
giving her an oriental look. The 
hand she rested on the door jamb 
was a waxy-white claw, a blue 
vein standing up prominently 
under the skin tight-drawn over 
gnarly finger joints. He had probably never seen a woman much 
past middle age. 

"Well?" Her croak was high 
and rough. 

HPHE young man recovered 
himself and began his spiel. 
"Madame, I represent one of the 



102 




 



best-known and most reputable 
firms in the country. Our products have received three international medals for purity and effective performance. They . . ." 

"What are you selling, young 
man?" 

"I have the privilege of being a 
field representative for Taffeta 
Beauty Aids. Please accept this 
generous ten-ounce bottle of our 
Diamond Dew Refreshest Lotion . . ." He reached into his side 
pocket and brought it out, offered it with the most appreciative smile, his 'you hardly need 
this' smile. 

Her hand did not reach out* "I 
don't want any. Goodbye!" The 
door tightened against his foot. 

"But madame," his foot did 
not budge and his smile became 
both engaging and pleading, "all 
I ask is a chance to show you 
our line. Our products sell themselves. Besides, I'm paid on a 
demonstration basis — so much for 
every potential customer who 
receives our free sample and so 
much for every home demonstration. You wouldn't want me to 
lose two-fifty when it would take 
only six and a third minutes of 
your time exactly to look over 
one of the most amazing displays 
ever . . ." 

"Well, I don't know . . 

"I know you'll enjoy watching 
our Tissue Cleanser in action and 
seeing the new simplicity of our 



Home Re- . . " (oops, he'd almost said it) . . Hair Relustrification Kit. I promise you 
that your few minutes won't be 
wasted." 

"Yours would be, young man. 
I don't buy that stuff." 

"You may be one of the lucky 
few women who don't need our 
products, but I don't think you 
can say that before you've seen 
them." 

"I never did see such persistence, honest to goodness!" Her 
face assumed a crabbed smile. 
"Come along then." 

SHE moved back from the door 
into the darkness of the house; 
and the salesman shifted his case 
back to his left hand, pushed the 
front door wide and took a quick 
long step inside. He was just in 
time to hear the slight click of the 
closing of a second door in front 
of him. He reached for the knob, 
turned it; but the door was locked. The outside door still stood 
open, caught by the end of the 
sample case. 

The July daylight from outside 
showed him that he was in a 
tiny entrance hall not more than 
forty inches each way. He pulled 
the case in and by squeezing 
against the inner door allowed the 
front door to close. Anyhow, he 
was inside the house. He rapped 
sharply on the inner door. a 
The latch on the front door 



THE TRAP

snapped to and instantly the hall 
was flooded with light from a 
tremendous bulb in the ceiling, 
which, surprisingly, was twenty 
feet above him. 

A harsh voice, tinny with tremendous amplification but unmistakably that of the old woman, 
filled the hall. "All. right, young 

MAN. I HAVE THE VTZER TURNED 
ON YOU. LET'S SEE THE DEMONSTRATION. I BELIEVE YOU SAID SIX 
MINUTES. GET ON WITH IT." 

Screening his eyes with his 
fingers, the salesman scanned the 
walls and ceiling for the vizer 
lens, found it beside the five-hundred watt bulb pouring blindingly down on him, on the other 
side of a speaker grille. 

"C-certainly, madame." What 
a layout. As he automatically 
laid his case on the floor and 
opened back the top against the 
front door, his eyes searched the 
walls for indications of openings 
which might mean unexpected defenses such as anesthetic tanks. 
The only breaks in the two 
smooth white plaster surfaces 
which he could see as he squatted 
before the case were a horizontal 
row of glass bosses on each side 
at about the height of his knees. 

"Now, since my face," he 
closed his eyes and flashed a 
toothy smile, like a video actor, 
up at the vi2er lens, "is subjected 
to the daily care of Taffeta Products," he turned his face down 



to the case and gritted his teeth, 
"I must smear facial muscle softener into the left half to show 
the action and appearance of 
muscles which have lost their 
tonus." He whipped the cover off 
a small ivorine jar and rubbed 
his cheek vigorously with a 
brownish salve. "You will note 
that this softener also contains a 
percentage of grime which lodges 
in the pores." 

He heard a gasp from the 
speaker grille when he displayed 
a faoe whose left cheek and brow 
were sagged, wrinkled and hideously brown speckled. From 
somewhere behind the gasp, he 
heard a continuous tinkle of tiny 
bells. 

His hands moved among the 
bottles and jars, raised a round 
silver box which he held up. 
"The delicately perfumed applicator pads for all applications of 
Taffeta Preparations are pre -saturated with Firmol Tone Charger. 
I dip the pad into this solution 
of Enhancing Hyssop/* he did 
so, "and work it gently into the 
pores. The results are instantaneous!" He turned up his original 
video star appearance. 

"W7HILE bending his body forward to reach the articles 
strapped to the top of the case, he 
noticed that the tone of the distant bells was raised. Screwing a 
circular hairbrush to the thread

THE TRAP 



of a collapsible tube, he sank back 
on his haunches. The bell tones 
were lower. He placed a hand on 
one of the glass bosses nearest 
the inner door, apparently to 
steady himself. An even lower 
tone was added to the bell notes. 
Obviously electric eyes with a set 
of bell signals in the old woman's 
present location. He smiled down 
at the floor — to himself. 

"Now I want you to notice 
closely this object which I will 
show you." He held up the brush 
with the tube screwed on its back 
and turned it about. "Do you 
know what this is?'* 

There was no answer from the 
speaker but its own hum and the 
tinkle of the bells. "What does 
it look like?" He spoke rapidly, 
pleasantly. There was still no 
answer. 

He rose quickly and tried the 
knob of the inner door again. He 
could hear the bell notes lower 
in pitch as he pressed against the 
door. 

"let me see the thing again, 
young man. honest to goodness, what difference does it 
make whether or not i know 
what it is? it looks like a 
hairbrush with some do-jigger 
on the top." 

He jumped back to the center 
of the hall. "This- brush is the 
essential feature of our sensational Hair Relustrifier Kit. The 
tube screwed to the top feeds the 



specially developed Brilliancette 
directly through each hollow 
bristle to reach every part of the 
hair.'* He ran or rather scrubbed 
the brush through the right side 
of his long fair pompadour with 
small rotary motions. When he 
removed the brush, that side of 
his head was covered with crisp 
yellow ringlets which shone under the light like sculptured gold. 

"THAT'S SOME SORT OF A TRICK ! 
DO IT ON THE OTHER . . Her 

voice was interrupted by a syncopated clicking. A telephone signal, "just a moment, young 
man." The hum of the speaker 
cut off and the sudden silence 
seemed full of the echoes of the 
bells. 

INSTANTLY the man dropped 
the gadget into the case and 
grabbed a handful of cleansing 
tissues from a box in it. He 
snapped down the top of the 
case and whipped the straps 
through the buckles. Then he 
shoved the case against one of 
the side walls and sat on it to 
flip off his shoes and socks. Shoving his back tightly against the 
wall, he bent his knees up and 
pushed his bare feet flat against 
the other. After placing the wad 
of tissues in his lap, he put his 
hands against the wall below his 
buttocks and, like an experienced 
mountain climber, inched his 
way rapidly up the 'chimney' of 



106 




 



the hall. When his head touched 
the ceiling, he braced himself 
firmly with his left hand and 
reached with his right for the tissues in his lap. Protecting his 
hand with several of the white 
papers, he felt above him for the 
base of the light bulb, unscrewed 
it, and dropped it gently onto the 
rest of the tissues still in his lap. 
The sudden blackness was smothering. ( 

H e at seeped through the tis sues more rapidly than he had 
expected; and the effort to keep 
his knees from contracting and 
spilling him in the utter darkness 
to the floor fifteen feet below was 
agony. 

When he finally reached the 
floor, he placed the bulb on it beside the sample case. Then he 
opened the front door and closed 
it again, leaving the door caught 
open a fraction of an inch by 
the latch against the frame. Taking an anesthetic cartridge out 
of his pants pocket, he broke the 
seal, taking care not to trigger it, 
and returned to his crevice-climbing posture. He lifted himself 
again above the row of electric 
eyes and waited, cartridge in 
hand, leg muscles cramping painfully. 

Jk FTER Miss Noble had 
turned off the speakphone, 
she pulled herself away from the 
fascinating view of golden curls 



and scuttled over to a stiff ladderback chair beside the telephone 
stand. She lifted the antique cradle phone (none of these modern 
invasions of privacy like the vizerphone) and spoke warily into 
the mouthpiece. 

"Who is it? What do you 
want?" 

"Barbara?" A man's voice was 
urgent. 

"This is Miss Noble speaking," 
she replied haughtily. 

The voice was savage. "Well, 
this is Doctor Harris, then. Have 
you looked at the mail today? I 
got my directors' meeting notice 
this morning." 

"Yes, I got one. The fifth of 
August," she said impatiently. 

"And this seems to be our year. 
There's been a girl here already 
this mo rnin g with so me story 
about my having advertised for a 
housekeeper. She told it to the 
doorphone and wouldn't leave 
when I said I didn't want anybody — but it only took one drop 
of skunk oil in the hallway to 
send her packing." The horrid 
chuckle that came from the receiver was so raucous that Miss 
Noble held it away from her ear. 

"Blonde or brunette ?" she 
asked noncommittally. 

"Blonde — and really young, 
not a damn rejuvenee!" 

"Rod Harris! You actually 
went and peeked at her, you old 
goat!" 



THE TRAP 



107 



"Only through the one-way." 

"Well, since the company 
knows that a pretty girl is still 
good bait for an old ninny, you're 
as good as a goner. They'll have 
you rejuvenated before long." 

"They won't get a chance to! 
And I'm going to get old enough 
so I can't even lift a hand to 
thumb my nose at the company. 
Then I'm going to go and die 
and the Juvine Perpetual Youth 
Corporation will scream in agony 
as it disbands and makes public 
property of its hallowed formulas 
as per the original articles of 
incorporation . . . and you will 
probably get a new set of false 
teeth and take the treatment 
again since you could get it real 
cheap when the monopoly's finished and not have to disturb 
your millions salted away in the 
sugar bowl." 

This mixture of facetiousness 
and downright sarcasm was only 
surpassed by Miss Noble, who 
snapped back, "Don't you sneer 
at me, Doctor Roland Harris, 
when you know perfectly well 
that the only reason I have to go 
on living this long is to make 
sure that you are really dead 
first. You didn't invent rejuvenation all by yourself without the 
aid of Barbara Noble, Ph.D., and 
the company has the sole right 
to the process until we're both 
dead. And, if you start peeking 
at plump blonde wenches at this 

103 



point, I suppose I'll have to live 
till Los Alamos freezes over!" 

"All right, all right. But she 
wasn't plump. She wasn't any 
bigger than you are. Besides, you 
know I'd rather have dinner with 
you. My man Marko could give 
us roast beef with all the fixings 
and afterward I want you to hear 
my latest discovery. It's the best 
damn extempore-singer you've 
ever heard, Jeery Wade — fellow 
in his first late fifties, no fluffbrain of a juvenee — a blood and 
thunder baritone that'll lift that 
knob of hair clean off your scalp. 
Let's say you get here about sixthirty and I'll phone him we'll 
be over at his place for a session 
of hollering about eight." 

MISS Noble's scorn needed no 
vizer to carry it over the 
wire in full force. "I'm not going 
to budge out of this house until 
after the director's meeting and 
then only if the shops stop all 
delivery service. This time I'm 
not taking any chances. Life is 
too much of a bore to have to 
put up with it for another eighty 
years even for your marvelous 
singer who would probably go 
and get rejuvenated just as I got 
'to enjoy him. And nothing could 
induce me to listen to an evening 
of your stories for the nine hundredth time. If there's one thing 
I'm thankful for in this scatterbrained age, it's the marriage I 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION ' 



dissolution law that's got me 
free from your anecdotes after 
three separate terms of fifty years 
each." 

"Now, Barbara, was it that 
bad?" Roland Harris sounded 
distressed. 

"Do you really think I could 
be honestly grateful to the Corporation for a hundred and fifty 
years of listening to that disgraceful old thing about the 
Martian, the Venusian, and the 
robot?" 

"Well, if you feel that way 
about it, I'll keep my discoveries 
to myself. I hope your fancy 
hallway keeps you safe till you 
rot." v 

"It's doing all right," replied 
the old woman smugly. "I have 
a young pup down there right 
now cooling his number thirteens 
and waiting to pretend to interest 
me in some new face paint and 
hair gik. My electric eye set and 
vizer are less repulsive than your 
skunk oil and twice as effective." 

"They're not going to stop me 
from having a good time while I 
last, anyhow. I think they're 
through with me for today; and 
I'm going to hear Jeery Wade, 
anyhow. Hell make up a hooting 
good song about all this when I 
tell him." 

"Take care of yourself, Rod . . . 
goodbye," said Miss Noble, almost concernedly. 

She dropped the phone into its 



cradle, rose, and went back to 
the vizer screen, switching on the 
speaker as she sat down. Only 
then did she notice that the 
screen was entirely dark except 
for a vague sliver of gray. 

"Are you still there, young 
man?" she asked the microphone. 

There was silence from the 
speaker. The hammer on each 
bar of the long metal xylophone 
of the electric eye signal hung 
motionless. 

"He's gone . . . and left the 
front door unlatched too. And I 
thought he was persistent." She 
was disappointed. "He owes me 
four more minutes of fun." 

She got up slowly and started 
for the door. "That curly hair 
stuff is new since my last sixties, 
too. I wonder if it would work 
on white hair ... I'd better go 
down and close the door. Can't 
have just anybody coming into 
one's house." 

SHE descended the stairs, 
opened the door from the 
front room, then took one step 
forward into the hall. Before she 
could interpret the soft bump of 
the salesman's bare feet as they 
struck the floor, she was encircled 
by his strong arm; and the hiss of 
the anesthetic gun was loud in 
the small area of the hall. Limply 
she sagged against his arm. 

The hissing of the gun stopped. 
The young man slipped it into 



THE TRAP 



109 



his pocket and,, turning, thrust 
the inner door wide open with 
his now free hand. Entering the 
tidy front room, he kicked the 
door shut behind him and gulped 
in the good air before he headed 
for the back of the house, cradling the small body easily in his 
arms. Failing to find there what 
he was looking for, he went up 
the narrow white-railed stairway 
to the second floor. Across the 
landing, the gleam of porcelain 
showed through a half-open 
door. 

He laid his burden carefully 
on the vari-colored braided rug 
by the tub and began to draw a 
warm bath, testing the temperature frequently with his hand. 
When water reached the overflow outlet, he turned off the tap 
and sprinted downstairs for his 
sample case. The hall was still 
chokingly full of gas; and after 
grabbing out the case, he slammed the door again. He brought 
the case up to the bathroom, 
where he opened it on the floor 
beside the form of the old woman. He lifted out the tray, revealing masses of silvery tubing 
and a number of flasks of iridescent solutions nestling among 
loops of rubber insulated wiring. 
One flask he emptied into the 
bath, making the 'water seethe 
and turn a cloudy green. 

Then, dashing down the stairs 
again, he began looking for the 



telephone. His search became 
more and more hurried, as he 
opened cupboards and drawers 
in front room and kitchen with 
no success. Returning upstairs , 
he almost missed the instrument 
in the sitting-room because he 
was expecting the familiar sight 
of a round vizer screen. He stood 
over the phone and dialed. 

"Hey, Alice!" 

"What luck, Riggy?" 

"I'm in. The old lady's out cold 
on the bathroom floor. Primer 
solution's in the bath at five 
above tepid. I'm shoving her in 
now — with all her clothes on, of 
course — and I've wasted a lot of 
time already looking for this hypoblasts phone, so beat it on 
over here with Margy and get to 
work." 

"Are you ordering me around, 
Rigel O'Maffey?" 

"You know I never did this 
job on a woman. And don*t forget, honey, we'll get enough out 
of this to get a new copter together. C'mon now." He put the 
phone back in the cradle before 
she could answer. 

1>ACK in the bathroom, he drew 
a long thermometer from the 
case, took a careful reading on 
the water, ran in a little more hot 
from the faucet and left it running the slightest dribble. 

Carefully lifting the small 
body of Barbara Noble, Ph.D., 



110 




 



he slid it gently into the water 
feet first over the end, smoothing 
down with one hand the percale 
housed ress which ballooned as 
she went into the water. Finally 
he knelt beside the tub, holding 
her head out of the water in the 
crook of his elbow. 

A banging on the inner door 
downstairs some fifteen minutes 
later reminded him of the force 
with which he had slammed it in 
his hurry to reach the uncontaminated air of the front room. He 
looked longingly across the bathroom at the racks of towels on 
the other side, but finally, as the 
banging stopped and a feminine 
voice began yelling, "Hey, Riggy! 
Let us in!" he grabbed up the 
bright rug and wadded it under 
the scrawny neck. 

The girls scolded him all the 
way up the stairs for not leaving 
the door unlocked, while he tried 
to explain, at the same time, that 
he had to hold up the woman's 
head. 

"Screepers, Riggy, what do you 
think the perfectly good pair of 
water-wings in your case is for?" 

Humbled, he departed as the 
girls took over the beginning of 
the complicated, fortnight-long 
process of the rejuvenation of 
Barbara Noble. 

^TiHE receptionist behind the 
■** ebony desk, whose gold plate 
proclaimed it as the headquarters 



of the Juvine Perpetual Youth 
Corporation, crammed shut the 
drawer before her. A metallic 
clink from within was the fall 
of a mirror with which she had 
been assisting the application of 
scarlet which now fluoresced 
gently on her full lips. 

Tossing her head (which 
showed the crop of glistening 
black curls to the fullest advantage) in a preoccupied manner, 
she addressed the man who stood 
before her desk. "How can the 
Juvine Perpetual Youth Corporation serve you?" Her hastily 
assumed look of efficient importance was replaced by melting 
eagerness as she took in the chiselled perfection of features and 
the broad shoulders of the young 
man in knife-creased bronze 
spunlon. 

"I'm Harris. For the directors' 
meeting." His voice was curt. 

"You're Doctor Harris? The 
Director? Oh, do come in." She 
rose from the desk and went 
around the end of it to open the 
high wrought-gold gate and hold 
it wide for him. "You're a little 
early. I'll take you down to the 
Board Room." Eager willingness 
to help was apparent in her 
every gesture. 

"Thanks, I know the way," he 
informed her t brushing past. 

She followed him, however, 
across the patio-like reception 
room, with its exotically gardened

borders and splashing fountain, 
down the" long corridor past glowing murals of men and women 
swimming, dancing and playing 
tennis, past tapestry shielded 
doorways to the great bright arch 
at the end. Before he went 
through, she caught his sleeve. 

"I should be pleased to steno 
for you today, if you need me." 

He turned and looked at her 
as if he had not known she was 
behind him. "Thanks, but I 
sha'n't need one. It'll be a short 
meeting." He smiled down and 
patted her cheek. "But if I'm not 
entirely satisfied with the proceedings, maybe I can dictate a 
little afterward." 

She laughed as if that were a 
special j oke between them and 
retreated rapidly down the corridor before he had time to turn 
and miss the splendor of her 
graceful carriage. 

His eyebrows were still raised 
and the corners of his mouth 
curved in appreciation when he 
passed through the arch and into 
the vast room under the clear 
bubble of a tremendous skydome. 

A GIRL was sitting there, her 
back to him, looking out 
over the simmering city streets 
to the cool rise of mountains beyond. He recognized' at once the 
slight figure, the sheen of the 
long curling auburn bob, the 
poise of her head and slim hand 



resting on the arm of the chair. 
"Babst" 

She turned half around. "Hello, 
Rod/' 

He grinned and sank down in 
the next chair. "Here we are 
again." 

"Knocked out by your own 
skunk oil?" she asked pointedly. 

"No. Company copter man got 
me leaving J eery Wade's. What 
happened to you? I thought you 
were walled up neatly for the declining years." 

"The cosmetic man ambushed 
me in the hall. But I've got another fifty years to figure out 
something better ... if I still 
need it." 

"What do you mean if you 
still need it? Are you changing 
your mind about rejuvenation?" 

She smiled. "Well, you know 
it's always fun at first. But I'm 
having my lawyer come to this 
meeting. I've got an idea we can 
change the articles of agreement 
so that the process can finally 
become public property at the 
end of another fifty years instead 
of only after our deaths. Then if 
we want to go on and die, nobody" (she waved her hand 
around the great room at the 
little group of athletic men and 
glamorous, expensively gowned 
women moving in through the 
arch) "nobody will have any financial interest in rejuvenating 
us. Then, too, our own fat un


lit 




 



comes will lapse ; and since that's 
the reason we set up the articles 
the way they are — so we'd never 
be in danger of starving, that is 
— we'd have the more interesting 
choice of whether to die off or 
get young again and go back to 
work. Would you sign a fiftyyear termination, Rod?" 

"Would you marry me for the 
fifty years, Babs?" His voice was 
gentle, pleading. 

"Honest to goodness, now, 
aren't you really pretty tired of 
me?*' she asked earnestly, turning to face him. 

"No, I can't say I am. You're 
pretty special, doctor, and you're 
special pretty/' It was a ritual. 

"You know you're the only 
man. I'll marry you. Will you 
sign?" 

"Of course I'll sign. I would 
have anyhow when I knew you 
wanted me to. And Babs — maybe we could get some sort of jobs 
now — sort of to get in practice. 
I'll bet we could rent a lab somewhere and do commercial analyses for a while until we got hit 
by another idea for research." 

"Rod, that's the best idea 
you've had in the last hundred 
and fifty years. But we could 
have a honeymoon first, couldn't 
we?" 

"That's your best suggestion 
in the last seventy years. And 
maybe we could get J eery Wade 
and his wife to rejuvenate and go 



with us. After the first couple of 
weeks, that is." 

rriHEY left the meeting arm in 
-'-arm, somewhat ahead of the 
rather disgruntled group of directors, who stayed behind to 
lament the end of a good thing. 
In the garden room, Barbara 
stopped to choose an orchid. 

Rod Harris wandered on to the 
receptionist's desk, where thejjirl 
of the black curls waited, smnmg. 

He looked back at Barbara, 
then smiled down at the girl. 
"Just like I said ... a short meeting. No need for any dictating. 
Lucky you." 

"Oh, I don't know/' she countered coyly. 

"Say, I heard a story the other 
day you might like. Do you like 
stories?" 

"What kind of story?" 

"You'd have to be the judge of 
that." 

Suddenly Barbara was with 
them, pinning on a bronze and 
green blossom . " C'mon along , 
dear. We've got a good many 
things to do before we leave." 

He opened the golden wicket 
for her and followed her out. 
Turning back toward the desk, 
he called to the girl, "I may be 
back in a few weeks to see about 
a job. Remind me then to tell 
you the one about the Martian, 
the Venusian and the robot.""
