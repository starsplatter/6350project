diplomatic immunity By ROBERT SHECKLEY 


"COME right in, gentlemen," the Ambassador 
waved them into the 
very special suite the State Department had given him- "Please 
be seated." 

Colonel Cercy accepted a chair, 
trying to size up the individual 
who had all Washington chewing 
its fingernails. The Ambassador 
hardly looked like a menace. He 
was of medium height and slight 
build, dressed in a conservative 
brown tweed suit that the State 
Department had given him. His 
face was intelligent, finely molded 
and aloof. 

As human as a human, Cercy 
thought, studying the alien with 
bleak, impersonal eyes. 

"How may I serve you?" the 
Ambassador asked, smiling. 

"The President has put me in 
charge of your case," Cercy said. 
"I've studied Professor Darrig's 
reports — " he nodded at the scientist beside him — "but I'd like to 
h.ear the whole thing for myself." 

"Of course," the alien said, 
lighting a cigarette. He seemed 
genuinely pleased to be asked; 
which was interesting, Cercy 
thought. In the week since he 
had landed, every * important 
scientist in the country had been 
at him. 

But in a pinch they call the 
Army, Cercy reminded himself. 
He settled back in his chair, both 
hands jammed carelessly in his 
pockets. His right hand was resting on the butt of a .45, the 
safety off. 

"T HAVE come," the alien said, 
"as an ambassador-at-large, 
representing an empire that 
stretches half-way across the 
Galaxy. I wish to extend the welcome of my people and to invite 
you to join our organization." 

"I see," Cercy replied. "Some 
of the scientists got the impression that participation was compulsory." 



"You will join," the Ambassador said, blowing smoke through 
his nostrils. 

Cercy could see Darrig stiffen 
in his chair and bite his Up. Cercy 
moved the automatic to a position where he could draw it 
easily. "How did you find us?" 
he asked. 

"We ambassa dors- at- large are 
each assigned an unexplored section of space," the alien said. "We 
examine each star-system in that 
region for planets, and each 
planet for intelligent life. Intelligent life is rare in the Galaxy, 
you know." 

Cercy nodded, although he 
hadn't been aware of the fact. 

"When we find such a planet, 
we land, as I did, and prepare 
the inhabitants for their part in 
our organization." 

"How will your people know 
that you have found intelligent 
life?" Cercy asked. 

"There is a sending mechanism 
that is part of our structure," the 
Ambassador answered. "It is triggered when we reach an inhabited 
planet. This signal is beamed continually into space, to an effective range of several thousand 
light-years. Follow-up crews are 
continually sweeping through the 
limits of the reception area of 
each Ambassador, listening for 
such messages. Detecting one, a 
colonizing team follows it to the 
planet."

He tapped his cigarette delicately on the edge of an ash tray. 
"This method has definite advantages over sending combined 
colonization and exploration 
teams obviously. It avoids the 
necessity of equipping large 
forces for what may be decades 
of searching." 

"Sure." Cercy's face was expressionless. "Would you tell me 
more about this message?" 

"There isn't much more you 
need know. The beam is not detectable by your methods and, 
therefore, cannot be jammed. The 
message continues as long as I am 
alive." v 




,ARRIG drew in his breath 
sharply, glancing at Cercy. 



"If you stopped broadcasting," 
Cercy said casually, "our planet 
would never be found." 

"Not until this section of space 
was resurveyed," the diplomat 
agreed. 

"Very well. As a duly appointed representative of the President 
of the United States, I ask you 
to stop transmitting. We don't 
choose to become part of your 
empire." 

"I'm sorry," the Ambassador 
said. He shrugged his shoulders 
easily. Cercy wondered how many 
times he had played this scene 
on how many other planets. 

"There's really nothing I can 
do.*' He stood up. 

DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



"Then you won't stop?" 

"I can't. I have no control over 
the sending, once it's activated." 
The diplomat turned and walked 
to the window. "However, I have 
prepared a philosophy for you. It 
is my duty, as your Ambassador, 
to ease the shock of transition as 
much as possible. This philosophy will make it instantly apparent that — ** 

As the Ambassador reached the 
window, Cercy's gun was out of 
his pocket and roaring. He 
squeezed six rounds in almost a 
single explosion, aiming at the 
Ambassador's head and back. 
Then an uncontrollable shudder 
ran through him. 

The Ambassador was no longer 
there I 

CERCY and Darrig stared at 
each other. Darrig muttered 
something about ghosts. Then, 
just as suddenly, the Ambassador was back. 

"You didn't think," he said, 
"that it would be as easy as all 
that, did you? We Ambassadors 
have, necessarily, a certain diplomatic immunity." He fingered one 
of the bullet holes in the wall 
"In case you don't understand, 
let me put it this way. It is not in 
your power to kill me. You 
couldn't even understand the na- * 
ture of my defense." 

He looked at them, and in that 
moment Cercy felt the Ambas
83 



sador's complete alienness. 

"Good day, gentlemen," he 
said. 

Darrig and Cercy walked silently back to the control room. 
Neither had really expected that 
the Ambassador would be killed 
so easily^ but it had still been 
a shock when the slugs had failed. 

"I suppose you saw it all, Malley?" Cercy asked, when he 
reached the control room. 

The thin, balding psychiatrist 
nodded sadly. "Got it on film, 
too." 

"I wonder what his philosophy 
is," Darrig mused, half to himself. 

"It was illogical to expect it 
would work. No race would send 
an ambassador with a message 
like that and expect him to live 
through it. Unless — " 

"Unless what?" 

"Unless he had a pretty effective defense," the psychiatrist 
finished unhappily. 

Cercy walked across the room 
and looked at the video panel. 
The Ambassador's suite was very 
special. It had been hurriedly constructed two days after he had 
landed and delivered his message: 
The suite was steel and lead lined, 
filled with video and movie cameras, recorders, and a variety of 
other things. 
* It was the last word in elaborate death cells. 

In the screen, Cercy could see 
the Ambassador sitting at a table. 



He was typing on a little portable 
the Government had given him. 

"Hey, Harrison!" Cercy called. 
"Might as well go ahead with 
Plan Two." 

Harrison came out of a side 
room where he had been examining the circuits leading to the 
Ambassador's suite. Methodically 
he checked his pressure gauges, 
set the controls and looked at 
Cercy. "Now?" he asked. 

"Now." Cercy watched the 
screen. The Ambassador was still 
typing. 

Suddenly, as Harrison sent 
home the switch, the room was 
engulfed in flames. Fire blasted 
out of concealed holes in the 
walls, poured from the ceiling 
and floor. 

In a moment, the room was like 
the inside of a blast furnace. 

Cercy let it burn for two minutes, then motioned Harrison to 
cut the switch. They stared at the 
roasted room. 

They were looking, hopefully, 
for a charred corpse. 

But the Ambassador reappeared beside his desk, looking 
ruefully at the charred typewriter. He was completely unsinged. 

"Could you get me another 
typewriter?" he asked, looking 
directly at one of the hidri> n 
projectors. "I'm setting down 
philosophy for you ungratelui 
wretches."

He seated himself in the wreckage of an armchair. In a moment, 
he was apparently asleep. 

" A LL right, everyone grab a 
seat," Cercy said. "Time for 
a council of war." 

Malley straddled a chair backward. Harrison lighted a pipe as 
he sat down, slowly puffing it into 
life. 

."Now, then," Cercy said. "The 
Government has dropped this 
squarely in our laps. We have to 
kill the Ambassador— obviously. 
I've been put in charge." Cercy 
grinned with regret. "Probably 
because no one higher up wants 
the responsibility of failure. And 
I've selected you three as my 
staff. We can have anything we 
want, any assistance or advice we 
need. All right. Any ideas?" 

"How about Plan Three?" Harrison asked. 

"Well get to that," Cercy said. 
"But I don't believe it's going to 
work." 

"I don't either," Darrig agreed. 
"We don't even know the nature 
of his defense." 

"That's the first order of business. Malley, take all our data 
so far, and get someone to feed it 
into the Derichman Analyzer. 
You know the stuff we want. 
What properties has X, if X can 
do thus and thus?" 

"Right," Malley said. He left, 
muttering something about the 



ascendancy of the physical sciences. 

"Harrison," Cercy asked, "is 
Plan Three set up?" 

"Sure." 

"Give it a try." 

While Harrison was making his 
last adjustments, Cercy watched 
Darrig. The plump little physicist was staring thoughtfully into 
space, muttering to himself. Cercy 
hoped he would come up with 
something. He was expecting 
great things of Darrig. 

Knowing the impossibility of 
working with great numbers of 
people, Cercy had picked his staff 
with care. Quality was what he 
wanted. 

With that in mind, he had 
chosen Harrison first. The stocky, 
sour-faced engineer had a reputation for being able to build anything, given half an idea of how 
it worked. 

Cercy had selected Malley, the 
psychiatrist, because he wasn't 
sure that killing the Ambassador 
was going to be a purely physical 
problem. 

Darrig was a mathematical 
physicist, but his restless, curious 
mind had come up with some 
interesting theories in other fields. 
He was the only one of the four 
who was really interested in the 
Ambassador as an intellectual 
problem. 

"He's like Metal Old Man," 
Darrig said finally. 



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



"What's that?" 

"Haven't you ever heard the 
story of Metal Old Man? Well, 
he was a monster covered with 
black metal armor. He was met 
by Monster-Slayer, an Apache 
culture hero. Monster -Slayer, 
after many attempts, finally 
killed Metal Old Man." 

"How did he do it?" 

"Shot him in the armpit. He 
didn't have any armor there." 

"Fine," Cercy grinned. "Ask 
our Ambassador to raise his 
arm." 

"All set.'" Harrison called. 
"Fine. Go." 

In the Ambassador's room, an 
invisible spray of gamma rays 
silently began to flood the room* 
with deadly radiation. 

But there was no Ambassador 
to receive them. 

"That's enough," Cercy said, 
after a while. "That would kill 
a herd of elephants." 

But the Ambassador stayed invisible for five hours, until some 
of the radioactivity had abated. 
Then he appeared again. 

"I'm still waiting for that typewriter," he said. 

"TTERE'S the Analyzer's report." Malley handed Cercy 
a sheaf of papers. "This is the 
final formulation, boiled down." 

Cercy read it aloud: "The simplest defense against any and all 
weapons, is to become each par


ticular weapon." 

"Great," Harrison said. "What 
does it mean?" 

"It means," Darrig explained, 
"that when we attack the Ambassador with fire, he turns into < 
fire. Shoot at him, and he turns 
into a bullet — until the menace is 
gone, and then he changes back 
again." He took the papers out of 
Cercy's hand and riffled through ; 
them. 

"Hmm. Wonder if there's any ! 
historical parallel? Don't suppose so." He raised his head. "Al- j 
though this isn't conclusive, it j 
seems logical enough. Any other j 
defense would involve recognition ] 
of the weapon first, then, an appraisal, then a countermove predicated on the potentialities of the : 
weapon. The Ambassador's defense would be a lot faster and 
safer. He wouldn't have to recog- < 
nize the weapon. I suppose his \ 
body simply identifies, in some 
way, with the menace at hand." 

"Did the Analyzer say there 
was any way of breaking this defense?" Cercy asked. 

"The Analyzer stated definitely 
that there was no way, if the 
premise were true," Malley answered gloomily. 

"We can discard that judgment," Darrig said. "The machine , 
is limited." 

"But we still haven't got any 
way of stopping him," Malley 
pointed out. "And he's still broad

casting that beam." 

Cercy thought for a moment. 
"Call in every expert you can 
find. We're going to throw the 
book at the Ambassador. I know/' 
he said, looking at Darrig's dubious expression, "but we have 
to try." 

pkURING the next few days, 
every combination and permutation of death was thrown at 
the Ambassador. He was show
! ered with weapons, ranging from 

] Stone-Age axes to modern highpowered rifles, peppered with 
hand grenades, drowned in acid, 
suffocated in poison gas. 

He kept shrugging his shoul
I ders philosophically, and continued to work on the new type
! writer they had given him. 

I Bacteria was piped in, first the 

J known germ diseases, then mu
i tated species. 

The diplomat didn't even 
sneeze. 

! He was showered with electricity, radiation, wooden weap1 ons, iron weapons, copper weap1 ons, brass weapons, uranium 
1 weapons — anything and everything, just to cover all possibilities. 

He didn't surfer a scratch, but 
i his room looked as though a barroom brawl had been going on in 
it continually for fifty years. 

Malley was working on an idea 
of his own, as was Darrig. The 



physicist interrupted himself long 
enough to remind Cercy of the 
Baldur myth. Baldur had been 
showered with every kind of 
weapon and remained unscathed, 
because everything on Earth had 
promised to love him. Everything, 
except the mistletoe. When a little 
twig of it was shot at him, he 
died. 

Cercy turned away impatiently, but had an order of mistletoe 
sent up, just in case. 

It was, at least, no less effective 
than the explosive shells or the 
bow and arrow. It did nothing except lend an oddly festive air to 
the battered room. 

After a *week of this, they 
moved the unprotcsting Ambassador into a newer, bigger, 
stronger death cell. They were 
unable to venture into his old 
one because of the radioactivity 
and micro-organisms. 

The Ambassador went back to 
work at his typewriter. AU his 
previous attempts had been 
burned, torn or eaten away, 

"Let's go talk to him," Darrig 
suggested, after another day had 
passed. Cercy agreed. For the moment, they were out of ideas. 

"r'OME right in, gentlemen," 
the Ambassador said, so 
cheerfully that Cercy felt sick. 
"I'm sorry I can't offer you anything. Through an oversight, I 
haven't been given any food or 



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



water for about ten days. Not 
that it matters, of course.", 

"Glad to hear it," Cercy said. 
The Ambassador hardly looked 
as if he had been facing all the 
violence Earth had to offer. On 
the contrary, Cercy and his men 
looked as though they had been 
under bombardment. 

"You've got quite a defense 
there," Malley said conversationally. 

"Glad you like it." 

"Would you mind telling us 
how it works?" Darrig asked innocently. 

"Don't you know?" 

"We think so. You become 
what is attacking y»u. Is that 
right?" 

"Certainly," the Ambassador 
said. "You see, I have no secrets 
from you." 

"Is there anything we can give 
you," Cercy asked, "to get you to 
turn off that signal?" 

"A bribe?" 

"Sure," Cercy said. "Anything 

you—?'* 

"Nothing," the Ambassador replied. 

"Look, be reasonable," Harrison said. "You don*t want to 
cause a war, do you? Earth is 
united now. We're arming — *' 

4, With what?" 

"Atom bombs," ' Malley answered him. "Hydrogen bombs. 
WeVe— " 

"Drop one on me," the Am
88 



bassador said. "It wouldn't kill 
me. What makes you think it , 
will have any effect on my peo- j 
pie?" | 

i 

THE four men were silent. j 
Somehow, they hadn't thought j 
of that. 

"A people's ability to make "j 
war," the Ambassador stated, "is \ 
a measure of the status of their 
civilization. Stage one is the use 
of simple physical extensions. 
Stage two is control at the molecular level. You are on the 
threshold of stage three, although 
still far from mastery of atomic 
and subatomic forces." He smiled 
ingratiatingly. "My people are 
reaching the limits of stage five." 

"What would that be?" Darrig 
asked. 

"You'll find out," the Ambassador said. "But perhaps you've 
wondered if my powers are typical? I don't mind telling you that 
they're not. In order for me to 
do my job and nothing more, I ■ 
have certain built-in restrictions, 
making me capable only of passive action." 

"Why?" Darrig asked. 

"For obvious reasons. If I were j 
to take positive action in a mo- i 
ment of anger, I might destroy j 
your entire planet." \ 

"Do you expect us to believe | 
that?" Cercy asked. 

"Why not? Is it so hard to understand? Can't you believe that 

A 1 A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



there are forces you know nothing about? And there is another 
reason for my passiveness. Certainly by this time you've deduced it?" 

"To break our spirit, I sup 
pose," Cercy said. 

"Exactly. My telling you won't 
make any difference, either. The 
pattern is always the same. An 
Ambassador lands and delivers 
his message to a high-spirited, 
wild young race like yours. There 
is. frenzied resistance against him, 
spasmodic attempts to kill him. # 
After all these fail, the people are 
usually quite crestfallen. When 
the colonization team arrives, 
their indoctrination goes along 
just that much faster." He paused, 
then said, "Most planets are more 
interested in the philosophy I 
have to offer. I assure you, it 
will make the transition far 
easier." 

He held out a sheaf of typewritten pages. "Won't you at least 
look through it?" 

Darrig accepted the papers and 
put them in his pocket. "When 
I get time." 

"I suggest you give it a try," 
the Ambassador said. "You must 
be near the crisis point now. Why 
not give it up?'* 

"Not yet," Cercy replied tonelessly. 

"Don't forget to read the philosophy," the Ambassador urged 
them. 



The men hurried from the 
room. 

""VTOW look," Malley said, once 
they were back in the control room, "there are a few 
things we haven't tried. How 
about utilizing psychology?" 

"Anything you like," Cercy 
agreed, "including black magic. 
What did you have in mind?" 

"The way I see it," Malley answered, "the Ambassador is 
geared to-respond, instantaneously, to any threat. He must have 
an all-or-nothing defensive reflex. I suggest first that we try 
something that won't trigger that 
reflex." 

"Like what?" Cercy asked. 

"Hypnotism. Perhaps we can 
find out something." 

"Sure," Cercy said. "Try it. 
Try anything." 

Cercy, Malley and Darrig gathered around the video screen as 
an infinitesimal amount of a light 
hypnotic gas was admitted into 
the Ambassador's room. At the 
same time, a bolt of electricity 
lashed into the chair where the 
Ambassador was sitting. 

"That was to distract him," 
Malley explained. The Ambassador vanished before the electricity 
struck him, and then appeared 
again, curled up in his armchair. 

"That's enough," Malley whispered, and shut the valve. They 
watched. After a while, the Anv 



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



89 



bassador put down his book and 
stared into the distance. 

"How strange," he said. "Alfern 
dead. Good friend . . . just a freak 
accident. He ran into it, out there. 
Didn't have a chance. But it 
doesn't happen often." 

"He's thinking out loud," Malley whispered, although there was 
no possibility of the Ambassador's 
hearing them. "Vocalizing his 
thoughts. His friend must have 
been on his mind for some time." 

"Of course," the Ambassador 
went on, "Alfern had to die sometime. No immortality — yet. But 
that way — no defense. Out there 
in space they just pop up. Always there, underneath, just 
waiting for a chance to boil out." 

"His body isn't reacting to the 
hypnotic as a menace yet,-" Cercy 
whispered. 

"Well," the Ambassador told 
himself, "the regularizing principle has been doing pretty well, 
keeping it all down, smoothing 
out the inconsistencies — " 

Suddenly he leaped to his feet, 
his face pale for a moment, as he 
obviously tried to remember what 
he had said. Then he laughed. 

"Clever. That's the first time 
that particular trick has been 
played on me, and the last time. 
But, gentlemen, it didn't do you 
any good. I don't know, myself, 
how to go about killing me." He 
laughed at the blank walls. 

"Besides," he continued, "the 



colonizing team must have the direction now. They'll find you ' 
with or without me." 

He sat down again, smiling. 

"rr^HAT does it!" Darrig cried. 

"He's not invulnerable. Something killed his friend Alfern." 

"Something out in space," 
Cercy reminded him, "I wonder 
what it was." 

"Let me see," Darrig reflected 
aloud. ''The regularizing principle. That must be a natural law 
.we knew nothing about. And underneath — what would be underneath?" 

"He said the colonization team , 
would find us anyhow," Malley 
reminded them. 

"First things first," Cercy said. 
"He might have been bluffing us 
, . . no, I don't suppose so. We 
still have to get the Ambassador f 
out of the way." 

"I think I know what is under- i 
neath!" Darrig exclaimed. "This -j 
is wonderful. A new cosmology, | 
perhaps." • * 

"What is it?" Cercy asked. 
"Anything we can use?" * 

"I think so. But let me work | 
it out. I think I'll go back to '] 
my hotel. I have some books 
there I want to check, and I don't ■ 
want to be disturbed for a few 
hours." 

"All right," Cercy agreed. "But 
what — ?" 

"No, no, I could be wrong," '., 




 



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



Darrig *said. "Let me work it 
out." He hurried from the room. 

"What do you think he's driving at?" Malley asked. 

' 'Beats me," Cer cy shrugged. 
"Come on, let's try some more of 
that psychological stuff." 

First they filled the Ambassador's room with several feet of 
water. Not enough to drown him, 
just enough to make him good 
and uncomfortable. 

To this, they added the lights. 
For eight hours, lights flashed in 
the Ambassador's room. Bright 
lights to pry under his eyelids; 
dull, clashing ones to disturb him. 

Sound came next — screeches 
and screams and shrill, grating 
noises. The sound of a man's 
fingernails being dragged across 
slate, amplified a thousand times, 
and strange, sucking noises, and 
shouts and whispers. 

Then, the smells. Then, everything else they could think of that 
could drive a man insane. 

The Ambassador slept peacefully through it all. 

NOW look," Cercy said, the 
following day, "let's start 
using our damned heads." His 
voice was hoarse and rough. Although the psychological torture 
hadn't bothered the Ambassador, 
it seemed to have backfired on 
Cercy and his men. 

"Where in hell is Darrig?" 
"Still working on that idea of 



his," Malley said, rubbing his 
stubbled chin. "Says he's just 
about got it." 

"We'll work on the assumption 
that he can't produce," Cercy 
said. "Start thinking. For example, if the Ambassador can turn 
into anything, what is there he 
can't turn into?" 

"Good question," v Harrison 
grunted. 

"It's the payoff question," 
Cercy said. "No use throwing a 
spear at a man who can turn 
into one." 

"How about this?" Malley 
asked. "Taking it for granted he 
can turn into anything, how about 
putting him in a situation where 
he'll be attacked even after he 
alters?" 

"I'm listening,'* Cercy said. 

"Say he's in danger. He turns 
into the thing threatening him. 
What if fhar thing were itself being threatened? And, in turn, was 
in the act of threatening something else? What would he do 
then?" 

"How are you going to put that 
into action?" Cercy asked. 

"Like this." Malley picked up 
the telephone. "Hello? Give me 
the Washington Zoo. This is 
urgent." 

The Ambassador turned as the 
door opened. An unwilling, angry, 
hungry tiger was propelled in. 
The door slammed shut. 

The tiger looked at the Ambas

sador. The Ambassador looked .at 
the tiger. 

"Most ingenious," the Ambassador said. * 

At the sound of his voice, the 
tiger came unglued. He sprang 
like a steel spring uncoiling, landing on the floor where the Ambassador had been. 

The door opened again. Another tiger was pushed in. He 
snarled angrily and leaped at the 
first. They smashed together in 
midair. 

The Ambassador appeared a 
few feet off, watching. He moved 
back when a lion entered the 
door, head up and alert. The lion 
sprang at him, almost going over 
on his head when he struck nothing. Not finding any human, the 
lion leaped on one of the tigers. 

The Ambassador reappeared in 
his chair, where he sat smoking 
and watching the beasts kill each 
other. 

In ten minutes the room looked 
like an abattoir. 

But by then the Ambassador 
had tired of the spectacle, and 
was reclining on his bed, reading. 

"T GIVE up," f Malley said. 
"That was my last bright 

idea." 

Cercy stared at the floor, not 
answering. Harrison was seated in 
the corner, getting quietly drunk. 

The telephone rang. 

"Yeah?" Cercy said. 



"I've got it!" Darrig's voice 
shouted over the line. "I really 
think this is it. Look, I'm taking 
a cab right down. Tell Harrison 
to find some helpers." 

"What is it?" Cercy asked. 

"The chaos underneath!" Darrig replied, and hung up. 

They paced the floor, waiting 
for him to show up. Half an hour 
p assed , then an hour . Finally, 
three hours after he had called, 
Darrig strolled in. 

"Hello," he said casually. 

"Hello, hell!" Cercy growled. 
"What kept you?" 

"On the way. over," Darrig 
said, "I read the Ambassador's 
philosophy. It's quite a work." 

"Is that what took you so 
long?" 

"Yes. I had the driver take me 
around the* park a few times, 
while I was reading it." 

"Skip it. How about — " 

"I can't skip it," Darrig said, 
in a strange, tight voice. "I'm 
afraid we were wrong. About the 
aliens, I mean. It's perfectly right 
and proper that they should rule 
us. As a matter of fact, I wish 
they'd hurry up and get here." 

But Darrig didn't look certain. 
His voice shook and perspiration 
poured from his face. He twisted 
his hands together, as though in 
agony. 

"It's hard to explain," he said. 
"Everything became clear as soon 
as I started reading it. I saw how 



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



stupid we were, trying to be independent in this interdependent 
Universe. I saw — oh, look, Cercy. 
Let's stop all this foolishness and 
accept the Ambassador as our 
friend." 

"Calm down!" Cercy shouted 
at the perfectly calm physicist. 
" Y ou d on't know what you' re 
saying." 

"Ir*s strange," Darrig said. "I 
know how I felt — I just don't feel 
that way any more, I think. Anyhow, I know your trouble. You 
haven't read the philosophy. 
You'll see what I mean, once 
you've read it." He handed Cercy 
the pile of papers. Cercy promptly ignited them with his cigarette 
lighter. 

"It doesn't matter," Darrig 
said. "I've got it memorized. Just 
listen. Axiom one. All peoples — " 

Cercy hit him, a short, clean 
blow, and Darrig slumped to the 
floor. 

"Those words must be semantically keyed," Malley said. 
"They're designed to set off certain reactions in us, I suppose. 
All the Ambassador does is alter 
the philosophy to suit the peoples he's dealing with." 

"Look, Malley," Cercy said. 
"This is your job now. Darrig 
knows, or thought he knew, the 
answer. You have to get that out 
of him." 

. "That won't be easy," Malley 
said. "He'd feel that he was be


traying everything he believes in, 
if he were to tell us." 

"I don't care how you get it," 
Cercy said. "Just get it." 

"Even if it kills him?" Malley 
asked. 

"Even if it kills you." 

"Help me get him to my lab/' 
Malley said. 

THAT night Cercy and Harrison kept watch on the Ambassador from the control room. 
Cercy found his thoughts were 
racing in circles. 

What had killed Alfern in 
space? Could it be duplicated on 
Earth? What was the regularizing 
principle? What was the chaos 
underneath? 

What in hell am I doing here? 
he asked himself. But he couldn't 
start that sort of thing. 

"What do you figure the Ambassador is?" he asked Harrison. 
"Is he a man?" 

"Looks like one," Harrison said 
drowsily. 

"But he doesn't act like one. I 
wonder if this is his true shape?" 

Harrison shook his head, and 
lighted his pipe. 

"What is there of him?" Cercy 
asked. "He looks like a man, but 
he can change into anything else. 
You can't attack him; he adapts. 
He's like water, taking the shape 
of any vessel he's poured into." 

"You can boil water," Harrison 
yawned.

"Sure. Water hasn't any shape, 
has it? Or has it? What's basic?" 

With an effort, Harrison tried 
to focus on Cercy's words. "Molecular pattern? The matrix?" 

"Matrix," Cercy repeated, 
yawning himself. "Pattern. Must 
be something like that. A pattern 
is abstract, isn't it?" 

"Sure. A pattern can be impressed on anything. What did I 
say?" 

"Let's see," Cercy said. "Pattern. Matrix. Everything about 
the Ambassador is capable of 
change. There must be some unifying force that retains his personality. Something that doesn't 
change, no matter what contortions he goes through." 

"Like a piece of string/' Harrison murmured with his eyes 
closed. 

"Sure. Tie it in knots, weave a 
rope out of it, wind it around 
your finger; it's still string." 

"Yeah." 

"But how do you attack a pattern?" Cercy asked. And why 
couldn't he get some sleep? To 
hell with the Ambassador and 
his hordes of colonists, he was 
going to close his eyes for a moment ... 

WAKE up, Colonel!" 
Cercy pried his eyes open 
and looked up at Malley. Besides 
him, Harrison Was snoring deeply. "Did you get anything?" 



"Not a thing," Malley confessed. "The philosophy must've 
had quite an effect on him. But 
it didn't work all the way. Darrig 
knew that he had wanted to kill 
the Ambassador, and for good 
and sufficient reasons. Although 
he felt differently now, he still had 
the feeling that he was betraying 
us. On the one hand, he couldn't 
hurt the Ambassador ; on the 
other, he wouldn't hurt us." 

"Won't he tell anything?" 

"I'm afraid it's not that simple," Malley said. "You know, if 
you have an insurmountable obstacle that must be surmounted 
. . . and also, I think the philosophy had an injurious effect on 
his mind." 

"What are you trying* to say?" 
Cercy got to his feet. 

"I'm sorry," Malley apologized, 
"there wasn't a damned thing I 
could do. Darrig fought the whole 
thing out in his mind, and when 
he couldn't fight any longer, he — 
retreated. I'm afraid he's hopelessly insane." 

"Let's see him." 

They walked down the corridor 
to Malley's laboratory. Darrig 
was relaxed on a couch, his eyes 
glazed and staring. 

"Is there any way of curing 
him?" Cercy asked. ' 

"Shock therapy, maybe." Malley was dubious. "It'll take a long 
time. And he'll probably block 
out everything that had to do 



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



95 



with producing this." 

Cercy turned away, feeling 
sick. Even if Darrig could be 
cured., it would be too late. The 
aliens must have picked up the 
Ambassador's message by now 
and were undoubtedly heading 
for Earth. 

"What's this?" Cercy asked, 
picking up a piece of paper that 
lay by Darrig's hand. 

"Oh, he was doodling," Malley 
said. "Is there anything written 
on it?" 

Cercy read aloud: w 'Upon further consideration I can see that 
Chaos and the Gorgon Medusa 
are closely related.' " 

"What does that mean?" Malley asked. 

"I don*t know," Cercy puzzled. 
"He was always interested in 
folklore." 

"Sounds schizophrenic," the 
psychiatrist said. 

Cercy read it again." 'Upon further consideration, I can see that 
Chaos and the Gorgon Medusa 
are closely related.' " He stared 
at it. "Isn't it possible," he asked 
Malley, "that he was trying to 
give us a clue? Trying to trick 
himself into giving and not giving 
at the same time?" 

"It's possible," Malley agreed. 
"An unsuccessful compromise — 
But what could it "mean?" 

"Chaos," Cercy remembered 
Darrig's mentioning that word in 
his telephone call. "That was the 



original state of the Universe in 
Greek myth, wasn't it? The formlessness out of which everything 
came?" 

"Something like that," Malley 
said. "And Medusa was one of 
those three sisters with the horrible faces." 

Cercy stood for a moment, 
staring at the paper. Chaos . . . 
Medusa. . . and the organizing 
principle! Of course! 

"I think — " He turned and ran 
from the room. Malley looked at 
him; then loaded a hypodermic 
and followed. 

IN the control room, Cercy 
shouted Harrison into consciousness. 

"Listen," he said, "I want you 
to build something, quick. Do you 
hear me?" 

"Sure." Harrison blinked and 
sat up. "What's the rush?" 

"I know what Darrig wantedto tell us," Cercy said. "Come 
on, I'll tell you what I want. And 
Malley, put down that hypodermic. I haven't cracked. I want 
you to get me a book on Greek 
mythology. And hurry it up." 

Finding a Greek mythology 
isn't an easy task at two o'clock 
in the morning. With the aid of 
FBI men, Malley routed a book 
dealer out of bed. He got his book 
and hurried back. 

Cercy was red-eyed and excited, and Harrison and his helpers 



96 




 



were working away at three crazy 
looking rigs. Cercy snatched the 
book from Malley, looked up one 
item, and put it down. 

"Great work," he said. "We're 
all set now. Finished, Harrison?" 

u Just about." Harrison and ten 
helpers were screwing in the last 
parts. "Will you tell me what 
this is?" 

"Me too," Malley put in. 

"I don't mean to be secretive," 
Cercy said. "I'm just in a hurry. 
I'll explain as we go along." He 
stood up. "Okay, let's wake up 
the Ambassador." 

r | ^HEY watched the screen as a 
bolt of electricity leaped from 
the ceiling to the Ambassador's 
bed. Immediately, the Ambassador vanished. 

"Now he's a part of that stream 
of electrons, right?" Cercy asked. 

"That's what he told us," Malley said. 

"But still keeping his pattern, 
within the stream," Cercy continued. "He has to, in order to 
get back into his own shape. Now 
we start the first disrupter." 

Harrison hooked the machine 
into circuit, and sent his helpers 
away. 

"Here's a miming graph of the 
electron stream," Cercy said. "See 
the difference?" On the graph 
there was an irregular series of 
peaks and valleys, constantly 
shifting and leveling. "Do you 



remember when you hypnotized 
the Ambassador? He talked about 
his friend who'd been killed in 
space." 

"That's right," Malley nodded. 
"His friend had been killed by 
something that had just popped 
up." 

"He said something else," Cercy went on. "He told us that the 
basic organizing force of the Universe usually stopped things like 
that. What does that mean to 
you?" 

"The organizing force," Malley 
repeated slowly. "Didn't Darrig 
say that that was a new natural 
law?" 

"He did. But think of the implications, as Darrig did. If an 
organizing principle is engaged 
in some work, there must be 
something that opposes it. That 
which opposes organization is — " 

"Chaos!" 

**Thafs what Darrig thought, 
and what we should have seen. 
The chaos is underlying, and out 
of it there arose an organizing 
principle. This principle, if I've 
got it right, sought to suppress 
the fundamental chaos, to make 
all things regular. 

"But the chaos still boils out 
in spots, as Alfern found out. Perhaps the organizational pattern is 
weaker in space. Anyhow, those 
spots are dangerous, tin til the organizing principle gets to work on 
them." 



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY

HE turned to the panel. "Okay, 
Harrison. Throw in the second disrupter." The peaks and 
valleys altered on the graph. They 
started to mount in crazy, meaningless configurations. 

"Take Darrig's message in the 
light of that. Chaos, we know, is 
underlying. Everything was formed out of it. The Gorgon Medusa 
was something that couldn't be 
looked upon. She turned men into stone, you recall, destroyed 
them. So, Darrig found a relationship between chaos and that 
which can't be looked upon. All 
with regard to the Ambassador, 
of course." 

' 'The Ambassador can't look 
upon chaos!" Malley cried. 

"That's it. The Ambassador is 
capable of an infinite number of 
alterations and permutations. But 
something — the matrix — can't 
change, because then there would 
be nothing left. To destroy something as abstract as a pattern, 
we need a state in which no pattern is possible. A state of chaos." 

The third disrupter was thrown 
into circuit. The graph looked as 
if a drunken caterpillar had been 
sketching on it. 

"Those disrupters are Harrison's idea," Cercy said. "I told 
him I wanted an electrical current with absolutely no coherent 
pattern. The disrupters are an extension of radio jamming. The 
first alters the electrical pattern. 



DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 



That's its purpose: to produce a 
state of patternlessness. The second tries to destroy the pattern 
left by the first; the third tries to 
destroy the pattern made by the 
first two. They're fed back then, 
and any remaining pattern is systematically destroyed in circuit 
... I hope." 

"This is supposed to produce 
a state of chaos?" Malley asked, 
looking into the screen. 

For a while there was only the 
whining of the machines and the 
crazy doodling of the graph. 
Then, in the middle of the Ambassador's room, a spot appeared. 
It wavered, shrunk, expanded — 

What happened was indescribable. All they knew was that 
everything within the spot had 
disappeared. 

"Switch it off" Cercy shoutedT 
Harrison cut the switch. 

The spot continued to grow. 

"How is it we're able to look 
at it?" Malley asked, staring at 
the screen, 

"The shield of Perseus, remember?" Cercy said. "Using it as a 
mirror, he could look at Medusa." 

"It's still growing !" Malley 
shouted. 

"There was a calculated risk in 
all this," Cercy said. "There's always the possibility that the chaos may go on, unchecked. If that 
happens, it won't matter much 
what — " 

The spot stopped growing. Its 



edges wavered and rippled, and 
then it started to shrink. 

"The organizing principle ,' ' 
Cercy said, and collapsed into a 
chair. 

"Any sign of the Ambassador?" 
he asked, in a few minutes. 

The spot was still wavering. 
Then it was gone. Instantly there 
was an explosion. The steel walls 
buckled inward, but held. The 
screen went dead. 

"The spot removed all the air 
from the room," Cercy explained, 
"as well as the furniture and the 
Ambassador." 

"He couldn't take it," Malley 
said. "No pattern can cohere, in 
a state of patternlessness. He's 
gone to join Alfern." 

Malley started to giggle. Cercy 
felt like joining him, but pulled 
himself together. 

"Take it easy," he said. "We're 
not through yet.*' 

"Sure we are! The Ambassador — " 

"Is out of the way. But there's 
still an alien fleet homing in on 
this region of space. A fleet so 
strong we couldn't scratch it with 
an H-bomb. They'll be looking 
for us." 

He stood up. 

"Go home and get some sleep. 
Something tells me that tome: 
row we're going to have to start 
figuring out some way Of camouflaging a planet."
