minimum sentence By THEODORE R. COGSWELL 

FLIP DANIELSON came 
striding into his fortycredit-a-day suite at the 
Hotel Metro, wearing a broad 
grin and a checked suit. 

"I've got him right where we 
want him," he said. "He's hanging on the ropes." 

Stretched out on the bed with 
a wet towel swathed around his 
head like a turban, the pudgy figure groaned and turned over, 
burying his face in the covers. 

"Go 'way. I'm a sick man." 




Flip skipped across the room, 
tossed the covers aside, and 
bounced up and down on the bed. 

"Snap out of it, Potsy. I've got 
us an out." 

The fat man winced at the motion and feebly raised his head. 

"I'll never live to use an out. 
What was I drinking last night — 
straight fusel-oil?" 

"Quang Dal was mixing cocktails out of creme-de-menthe and 
anisette, and you were taking two 
to every one of his just to be sociable." 

"That explains it," groaned 
Potsy. "Hand me that bottle on 
the bureau, like a good fellow. 
I've got to do something to get 
rid of that aftertaste." 

Flip went over and got it, stopped to take a short sample himself, and then handed it over. 
There was a liquid gurgle as the 
bottle dropped an inch and a 
half, and then a satisfied sigh. 

"Maybe I'll live, after all. Now, 
who's on the ropes?" 

"Quang Dal. No thanks to you, 
though. You were passed out in 
the corner, snoring like a pig, 
when I rolled him." 

rwiHE fat man looked up in sudden interest. "How much did 
you get?*' 

"Looks like about four thousand. I haven't bothered to count 
it yet." 

"Toss it over. I'll be glad to." 



"It'll do for chicken feed." 

Potsy clucked like a hen and 
grabbed the billfold. He pulled 
out a thick sheaf of currency and 
ran his fingers over it reverently. 

"Think of the time we can 
have — " He broke off suddenly 
and tossed the money despondently on the floor. "Could have 
had, I mean. We won't have any 
use for money where we're going. Twenty years — minimum.'" 
He grabbed his head between his 
hands as it started in throbbing 
again. 

"And forty years maximum," 
said Flip unsympathetically. 
"Next time you line up an easy 
mark, make sure she's not the 
Police Commissioner's motherin-law." 

"Maybe something will happen. We've still got three weeks 
before we have to report for sentencing." 

"So?" 

"We've still got the ship. We 
could make a run for it." 

"Where to? If it's any place in 
the Solar System where people 
can live, the law's there. And if 
it's a place where the law isn't, 
people can't live.'* 

Potsy drank unhappily from 
his bottle. "What gets me is that 
the floppers and the crawlers and 
the wigglers and the rest can hop 
around the Galaxy in just about 
nothing flat while we humans 
can't go past Pluto. If we could

just get our hands on one of their 
faster-than- light drives, we could 
thumb our noses at the law." He 
sighed. "If wishes were horses . . ." 

"Get ready to saddle up." 
There was a complacent smile on 
Flip's face as he tossed a long 
manila envelope on to the bed. 
"The thought of sitting in a Lunar prison cell for the next twenty 
years with nothing to look at but 
your fat face was just too much — 
so I went and did something 
about it." 

Potsy opened .the envelope and 
stared at its contents in bewilderment. 

Flip grinned. "Return ticket, 
passport, identity card — the 
works. His ship takes off at ten 
and I've pumped enough DDT 
into him to keep him under for 
another six hours. When Quang 
Dal comes to, he's going to be 
an unhappy little Centaurian — 
broke, stranded, and friendless. 
Do you begin to get the picture?" 

Potsy looked up at his partner 
with open admiration. "Not 
friendless. He's got us." 

WHEN Quang Dai's six legs 
had recovered sufficient 
strength to carry him down the 
corridors in a tottering crawl, the 
first thing he did was to go to the 
police. 

"Get outta here before I squash 
ya," growled the desk sergeant. 
"If we're such ignorant bums we 



ain't good enough to be let in 
your Galactic Union, we sure 
ain't smart enough to help you 
out when you get into a jam." 

"But, sir," protested Quang 
Dal, "I am just poor priwate Centaurian citizen who have nothing 
to do with admission standards 
whatsoewer. Is not to be despairing for that, howewer. Has 
not Grand Council giwen fine 
promise that admission shall be 
accompaniment of attainment of 
minimumnal socialization percentile?" 

"Scram," said the desk sergeant. "I ain't paid to get lectured 
by cockroaches." 

Quang Dal drew himself up 
with dignity. "Is, one, inaccurate 
statement — terrestrial cockro ach 
is not sapient being. Is, two, obviously hostile manifestation. Is 
through politeness and well wishing comes minimumnal socialization, not harsh speaking. In 
Cosmos, all entities are siblings. 
Translation: brothers and/or sisters." 

With a quick wabble to the 
left, he avoided the descending 
boot and scuttled toward the 
door. 

"I love you," he said ceremoniously, but earnestly. "Is well 
wishing with a wengeance." 

At the Bureau of Extraterrestrial Affairs, he received a politer 
reception, but little in the way of 
help.

"Terribly sorry, old man," said 
the Third Assistant. "Wouldn't 
have had it happen for all the 
worlds. Don't know quite what 
I can do about it, though, now 
that your ship's gone. It was the 
first one in twenty years and 
there's no telling when the next 
one will stop by. It is rather 
shameful the way the rest of the 
Galaxy tends to avoid us, you 
know. I mean, after all, if you 
chaps would let us in on the 
faster -than -light drive and a few 
things like that, we wouldn't be 
so embarrassingly provincial." 

"Are explaining many times before," said Quang Dal patiently. 
"Is no such thing as faster-thanlight drive. As your good man 
Einstein show you long time ago, 
is theoretical impossibility." 

The Third Assistant sniffed his 
disbelief. "And how many months 
has it been since you left Alpha 
Centauri?" 

"Three months between time, 
but is not workable for Solar peoples. Is only what you call a conwenience." 

The official maintained his professional calm, but there was a 
little edge to his voice. 

"I take it, then, that you consider us too stupid to know how 
to use it?" 

"Did not say," said Quang Dal. 
"Is only unachievement of minimumnal socialization. Are principles inwolved that might be 



used for harm to other entities." 

The Third Assistant glanced at 
his watch, rose from his desk, and 
ushered the little Centaurian to 
the door. 

"You'll have to excuse me, old 
man.- Tea time, you know. Sorry 
I can't offer you a lift home on 
one of our ships, but since we've 
never been able to do better than 
one-fifth light speed, I'm afraid 
that we'll just have to putter 
around inside our own solar system until you chaps decide we're 
socialized enough to be given the 
galactic drive. I'll make a personal note of your case, however, 
and when an extraterrestrial ship 
drops in, one of my successors 
will get in touch with you immediately." 

Quang Dai's attempt to explain 
again that there was no such 
thing as a faster-than- light drive 
was cut short by the closing of 
the door in his face. Rearing up 
on his hind legs, he ran his voice 
tube through the keyhole and 
said politely, "Note, please — I 
love you." 

TTIS only friends in a strange 
and hostile world, Potsy and 
Flip, were waiting for him when 
he got back to the hotel. 

"How did it go?" 

"Is, as you say, without soap," 
said Quang Dal mournfully. "Is 
constant expectoration upon by 
unwell-wishers."

"Don't let it get you down, 
pal," comforted Potsy. "What do 
you expect from a bunch of bums 
with a low-grade socialization index?" He reached in his pocket, 
pulled out a bulging billfold, and 
peeled off several bills. "Here's a 
little ready cash. Just remember 
that no matter what happens, 
ydu've still got us." 

Flip nodded his agreement. 
"What's ours is yours. It may be 
fifty years before another galactic ship stops by, and even then 
it may be going the wrong way, 
but we'll stand by you!" 

"If fifty years, .not too bad," 
said Quang Dal. "Is sewenty-five, 
is too late, I think so maybe. Is 
now Ides of March. Would be 
most inconwentencing to spousesto-be if not returning by June. Is 
getting married then," he explained, "and sewening no good with 
only six." 

"If you're saying what I think 
you're saying," Potsy said, sympathetically, "you're in a tough 
spot, If you've got to wait fifty 
years, it won't be much of a marriage." 

"Yeah," agreed Flip. "I can 
just see the poor girls waiting for 
their lover to come home, hopefully setting a light in their windows each night, slowly losing 
hope as the years pass— growing 
lined and gray and bitter with 
the thoughts of what might have 
been." 



"Is many misconceptions here," 
said Quang Dal. "In first place, is 
not year question, is month question. In second, is not females on 
Alpha Centauri same kind like 
Earth. Is seven sexes, I am splanton, number four kind." He went 
into a detailed description of relations and permutations that left 
the two Earthmen confused. 

"If this is what is meant by 
being socialized," said Potsy finally, "I don't see how Earth will 
ever make it.*' 

"OOTSY," Flip said, "if our 
friend has to be home by 
June to get married, we're going 
to see that he makes it. Like he's 
always saying, all entities are 
siblings under the epidermis." 

"I'm all for it," said his partner, "but how?" 

"We've got a ship, haven't we?" 

"Yeah, but without the galactic drive, it would take him twenty years to get back and he's due 
in June." 

"He can make it," said Flip 
confidently. "All he has to do is 
build one of those faster-thanlight gadgets and install it in the 
ship. Then he could make it back 
in time." 

"Is not faster than light," objected Quang Dal once more. "Is 
merely conwenience. But if loanation of ship could be made, 
would be well-wishing with a 
wengeance and impressive sign of 




 



attainment of minimumnal socialization/' 

rpHREE weeks later, the job 
was done. 

"Is all fix and workable fine," 
said Quang Dal. "You come down 
and see me off in morning. Is 
needful to express final love and 
gratitude." 

"Wouldn't miss it for the 
world," said Flip. 

"I think I go make last-time 
checkup." 

When he left, Potsy pulled off 
his shoes and stretched on the bed. 

"Looks like we'll make it." 

"Just in time, too," said Flip. 
"In case you've forgotten, we're 
due down at the Justice Department at noon tomorrow for sentencing." He shuddered. "Twenty 
years would have been a long 
time!" 

"Not as long as .forty," said 
Potsy. "I think I'll have a bottle 
sent up. I feel like celebrating." 

"Excellent idea. Order up five 
women while you're at it. We owe 
it to our race to see if we can get 
onto this sevening." 

At eight sharp the next morning, the two were standing in the 
control room of their spaceship 
listening to Quang Dai's last 
grateful good-bys. 

"It's nothing at all," said Flip. 
"We'd do the same for any friend. 
How about showing us around 
before you take off?" 



Quang Dal thought for a moment and then quivered assent. 

"Would be no real wiolation of 
Galactic Union order. Secret 
things are all behind panels." 

The control room had been 
considerably altered. In place of 
the complicated banks of controls that had flanked the pilot's 
seat, there were two push buttons 
set in a simple black box. 

"This one take care of nawigation," explained Quang Dal. "One 
push, I go home. Start, go, stop — 
whole thing automatical. Could 
not change course if wanted to." 

"You don't have to tell us what 
the other one controls," said Potsy. "One push and WHOOSH, 
Alpha Centauri in June." 

"Is not whoosh. Is putt-puttputt. Wery conwenient, though." 

"Well, I guess we're ready," 
said Potsy. "Do you want to do 
the honors, Flip, or shall I?" 

"Is not understanding," Quang 
Dal equivalently frowned. 

"Didn't you tell him?" asked 
.Flip. 

"I thought he'd take it for 
granted. After all, somebody has 
to bring the ship back." 

Quang Dal reared up on his 
back four legs in an agitated fashion. 

"Accompaniment cannot be, 
sweet entities. Is not only Galactic Union law wiolation, but not 
possible for two-legged human 
peoples."

'LIP produced a large and vicious-looking gun. 



"Anything bugs can do, we can 
do better. Get aft before I splatter you against the bulkhead!" 

"Weapon-using is sign of low 
socialization," said Quang Dal 
with regret and pity. 

"Are you talking or walking?" 
demanded Flip, sighting down 
the barrel of his gun. 

"Is terrible thing you doing," 
warned the little Centaurian as 
he backed out of the control 
room. "You have no right to do 
this to selves." 

Potsy walked over to the control box. He reached out to press 
the first button and then hesitated. 

"What if something should 
happen?" he asked worriedly. 

"Couldn't be worse than twenty years in a Lunar isolation cell," 
said Flip. "You can stay behind 
if you want to, but I'm getting 
out of here.*' 

Potsy still hesitated. Finally he 
came back and sat down. 

"You push it," he offered. 

Flip snorted in disgust and 
tossed his gun over to his partner. 
"Go on back and lock our little 
friend up in the aft stateroom. If 
we let him run around loose, he 
might get into mischief. I'll take 
care of things up here." ■ 

When Potsy had left the compartment , Flip took a deep 
breath, walked over to the con


trol box, and slowly pushed the 
first button. The results weren't 
spectacular. There was a hum of 
lifters as the ship rose slowly, and 
then, with a gentle push, they 
were off. Once out of the atmosphere, the ship pointed its nose 
toward Alpha Centauri and began 
to pick up speed. 

Potsy came back into the control room and took a quick look 
out the side port to where the 
Moon hung like a great pockmarked balloon. The penal colony itself couldn't be seen, but 
Lunaport was visible as a small 
glittering splotch. 

He gave a little shiver and 
turned away. 

"Everything under control?" 

"So far. Do you think I ought 
to hit the other stud?" 

Potsy shook his head. "The 
galactic ships never seem to use 
their drives until they are far 
enough away to be out of detection range. There must be a reason for it. Maybe the gadget 
blows up if it's set off near a 
sun." 

They waited two days before 
Flip pressed the second button. 
There was a low whine from beneath the deck and then a squeal 
of fright from Potsy as a nerve scraping vibration ran through 
the ship. A strange mistiness covered everything, as though the 
matter of which the ship was 
composed were turning to noth



 



ingness and then back again a 
thousand times a second. 

With a final shudder, the ship 
returned to normal. 

Potsy gave a sigh of relief and 
mopped his forehead. "Well, we're 
still in one piece. And I guess 
we're finally on our way." 

"Go let Quang Dal out," said 
Flip. "If these controls are as 
completely automatic as he says, 
he can't do us any harm now." 

Potsy came back five minutes 
later, alone. 

"He's got his door locked from 
the inside. He says that he's going 
to take a little nap and we should 
wake him come June." 

Flip shrugged. "If that's the 
way he wants it." 

AS the weeks crawled slowly 
by, the two Earthmen found 
themselves growing more and 
more irritable. 

"I think I'd almost prefer the 
Lunar prison colony," said Potsy. 

"Oh, well," growled Flip, 
"we've only got two weeks left. I 
guess I can stand your ugly face 
that long." 

Potsy gestured toward Alpha 
Centauri which glimmered palely 
directly ahead. "You'd think it 
would be getting bigger by now." 

"It'll stay like that almost to 
the end," said Flip. "The way I 
got it figured, we're going so fast 
, that most of the light shoots past 
before it has a chance to get in. 



If you want to see the difference, 
go take a look through the rear 
'scope. The Sun should be out of 
sight by now." 

Potsy trotted obediently to the 
rear and took a look out through 
the aft telescope. A moment later, 
he returned and asked in a timid 
and somewhat frightened voice, 
"If the Sun's supposed to be so 
far away, how come I can still 
see most of the planets?" 

"Huh? You can?" Flip looked 
nervous as Potsy nodded. "That 
lousy little bug must have given 
us cockeyed instructions, knowing the galactic drive is Greek to 
us." 

"But why should he?" 

"How do I know? Maybe he 
wants us to break our necks some 
way while he's safe in his cabin. 
Well, I'll break his if he doesn't 
.give us the right dope!" 

"Go easy," Patsy advised anxiously. "Try to con the information out of him first. Then let 
him have it if he won't talk." 

After considerable pounding, 
they managed to wake Quang 
Dal. His voice tube poked out 
through the grille at the top of 
his locked door and he asked politely, "Is June already?" 

"No," said Flip, "it's only the 
middle of May. Potsy and I are 
sorry to have to wake you up, but 
something seems to have gone 
wrong with the drive. Would you 
mind coming out and fixing it?"

"Is nothing wrong," replied 
Quang Dal. "Can hear with propemess from here. Sound smooth." 

"The planetary drive is on, all 
right, but the faster- than- light 
didn't cut in. After all this time, 
we're still only a stone's throw 
from Earth. We should be almost 
to Alpha Centauri by now." 

THERE was silence within the 
stateroom for a minute. "Is 
unhappiness to say this," the little Centauri an said regretfully, 
"but ' as I explain past times, 
faster-than -light drive is theoretical impossibility. Galactic 
Union scientists work two, maybe 
three million years now. For all 
this time, nothing, except once in 
a while little conwenience. Is still 
taking twenty years going Earth, 
Alpha Centauri, or wice-wersa." 

"Then how in hell do you expect to get home in three 
months?" 

"Is three months between time, 
not three months pass time. 
Wery different things," said 
Quang Dal. "Between time is 
from little conwenience I tell you 
before about. With it, can take 
trip maybe two hundred years 
and still not be away from family 
too long. Wery fine conwenience." 

"Two hundred years!" gasped 
Potsy. 

"Is one other thing which 
you mistake for faster- than- light 
drive. Old galactic peoples like 



Centaurians live thirty-five, maybe forty thousands Earth years. 
Would not be socialized to tell 
poor Earth two-legged standeruppers they live and die same 
thing like I get up and go bed. Is 
not well-wishing to make other 
entities unhappy. Would not tell 
you this;, only I think you unhappier if I do not explain. So 
sorry." 

Flip stood rigid, his brain 
freezing as the cold and horrid 
truth began to seep in. 

"Then the second button . . ." 

"Is biggest conwenience. Faster than-light drive impossible, but 
not time travel. Push second button, whole ship come back nineteen years, nine months. Could 
make it exactly same time of 
same year we leave Earth when 
we reach Alpha Centauri, but I 
like better awaken at time of 
sewening, so I set controls for 
June." 

His voice was drowsier. 

"You will wake me in June, . 
kindly? Until, I take small nap 
— only twenty years. Apologizing 
that you cannot do likewise." 

Quang Dai's voice was almost 
inaudible as he withdrew his 
voice tube from the grille. 

"Is wishing well with a wengeance," he said, too conditioned 
to politeness to let weariness excuse him from the ritual of farewell. "Note, please — I love you."
