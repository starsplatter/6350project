The Last Martian By FREDRIC BROWN 

IT WAS an evening like any 
evening, but duller than most. I 
was back in the city room after 
covering a boring banquet, at which 
the food had been so poor that, even 
though it had cost me nothing, I'd 
felt cheated. For the hell of it, I 
was writing a long and glowing account of it, ten or twelve column 
inches. The copyreader, of course, 
would cut it to a passionless paragraph or two. 

Slepper was sitting with his feet 
up on the desk, ostentatiously doing 
nothing, and Johnny Hale was putting a new ribbon on his typewriter. 
The rest of the boys were out on 
routine assignments. 

Cargan, the city ed, came out of 
his private office and walked over 
to us. 

"Any of you guys know Barney 
Welch?" he asked us. 

A silly question. Barney runs Barney's Bar right across the street from 
the Trib. There isn't a Trib reporter 
who doesn't know Barney well 
enough to borrow money from him. 
So we all nodded. 

"He just phoned," Cargan said. 



"He's got a guy down there who 
claims to be from Mars." 

"Drunk or crazy, which?" Slepper wanted to know. 

"Barney doesn't know, but he said 
there might be a gag story in it if 
we want to come over and talk to 
the guy. Since it's* right across the 
street and since you three mugs are 
just sifting on your prats, anyway, 
one of you dash over. But no drinks 
on the expense account." 

Slepper said, "I'll go," but Cargan's eyes had lighted on me. "You 
free, Bill?" he asked. "This has got 
to be a funny story, if any, and you 
got a light touch on the human interest stuff." 

"Sure," I grumbled. "I'll go." 
" "Maybe it's just some drunk being 
funny, but if the guy's really insane, 
phone for a cop, unless you think 
you can get a gag story. If there's an 
arrest,, you got something to hang a 
straight story on." 

Slepper said, "Cargan, you'd get 
your grandmother arrested to get a 
story. Can I go along with Bill, just 
for the ride?" 

"No, you and Johnny stay here. 



THE LAST MARTIAN 



We're not moving the city room' 
across the street to Barney's." Cargan went back into his office. 

I slapped a "thirty" on to end the 
banquet story and sent it down the 
tube. I got my hat and coat. JSlepper 
said, "Have a drink for me, -Bill. 
But don't drink so much you lose 
that light touch." 

I said, "Sure," and went on over 
to the stairway and down. 

I walked into Barney's and looked 
around. Nobody from the Trib was 
there except a couple of pressmen 
playing gin rummy at one of the 
tables. Aside from Barney himself, 
back of the' bar, there was only one 
other man in the place. He was a 
tall man, thin and sallow, who was 
sitting by himself in one of the 
booths, staring morosely into an almost empty beer glass. 

I THOUGHT I'd get Barney's 
angle first, so I went up to the 
bar and put down a bill. "A quick 
one," I told him. "Straight, water 
on the side. And is tall-and-dismal 
over there the Martian you phoned 
Cargan about?" 

He nodded once and poured' my 
drink. 

"What's my angle?" I asked him. 
"Does he know' a reporter's going 
to interview him? Or do I just buy 
him a drink and rope him, or what? 
How crazy is he?" 

"You tell me. Says he just got in 
from Mars two hours ago and he's 
trying to figure it out. He says he's 
the last living Martian. He doesn't 



know you're a reporter, but he's all 
set to talk to you. J set it up." 
"How?" 

"Told him I had a friend who 
was smarter than any usual guy and 
.could give him good advice on what 
to do. I didn't tell him any name 
because I didn't know who Cargan 
would' send. But he's all ready to cry 
on your shoulder." 

"Know bis name?" 

Barney grimaced. "Yangan Dal, 
he says. Listen, don't get him violent or anything in here. I don't 
want no trouble." 

I downed my shot and took a sip 
of chaser. I said, "Okay, Barney. 
Look, dish up two beers for us and 
I'll go over and take 'em with me." 

Barney drew two beers and cut off 
their heads. He rang up sixty cents 
and gave me my change, and I went 
over to the booth with the beers. 

"Mr. Dal?" I said. "My name is 
Bill Everett. Barney tells me you 
have a problem I might help you 
on." 

He looked up at me. "You're the 
one he phoned? Sit down,- Mr. 
Everett. And thanks very much for 
the beer." 

I slid into the booth across from 
him. He took the last sip of his 
previous beer and wrapped nervous 
hands" around the glass I'd just 
bought him. 

"I suppose you'll think I'm crazy," 
he said. "And maybe you'll be right, 
but — I don't understand it myself. 
The bartender thinks I'm crazy, I 
guess. Listen, are you a doctor?"

"Not exactly," I told him. "Call 
me a consulting psychologist." 

"Do you think I'm insane?' 

I said, "Most people who are 
don't admit they might be. But I 
haven't heard your story yet." 

He took a draught of the beer and 
put the glass down again, but kept 
his hands tightly around the glass, 
possibly to keep them from shaking. 

He said, "I'm a Martian. The last 
one. All the others are dead. I saw 
their bodies only two hours ago." 

"You were on Mars only two 
hours ago? How did you get here?" 

"I don't know. That's the horrible thing. I don't know. All I 
know is that the others were dead, 
their bodies starting to rot. It was 
awful. There were a hundred million 
of us, and now I'm the last one." 

"A hundred million. That's the 
population of Mars?" 

"About that. A little over, maybe. 
But that was the population. They're 
all dead now, except me. I looked 
in three cities, the three biggest 
ones. I was in Skar, and when I 
found all the people dead there, I 
took a targan — there was no one to 
stop me — and flew it to Undaftel. 
I'd never flown one before, but the 
controls were simple. Everyone in 
Undanel was dead, too. I refueled 
and flew on.- 1 flew low and watched 
and there was no one alive. I flew 
to Zandar, • the biggest city — over 
three million people. And all of 
them were dead and starting to rot. 
It was horrible, I tell you. Horrible. 
I can't get over the shock of it." 



"I can imagine," I said. 

ii ~\TOU can't. Of course it was a 
JL dying world, anyway; we 
didn't have more than another dozen generations left to us, you understand. Two centuries ago, we numbered three billion — most of them 
starving. It was the kryl, the disease 
that came from the desert wind and 
that our scientists couldn't cure. In 
two centuries it reduced us to onethirtieth of our number and it still 
kept on.' , 

"Your people died, then, of this — 
kryl?" 

"No. When a Martian dies of 
kryl, he withers. The corpses I saw 
were not withered." He shuddered 
and drank the rest of his beer. I saw 
that I'd neglected mine and downed 
it. I raised two fingers at Barney, 
who was watching our way and 
looking worried. 

My Martian went on talking. "We 
tried to develop space travel, but s 
we couldn't. We thought some of 
us might escape the kryl, if we came 
to Earth or to other worlds. We 
tried, but we failed. We couldn't 
even get to Deimos or Phobos, our 
moons." 

"You didn't develop space travel? 
Then how — " 

"I don't know. / don't know, and 
I tell you it's driving me wild. I 
don't know how I got here. I'm 
Yangan Dal, a Martian. And I'm 
here, hi this body. It's driving me 
wild, I tell you."" 

Barney came with the beers. He

looked worried enough, so I waited 
until he was out of hearing before 
I asked, "In this body? 'Do vou 
mean — " 

"Of course. This isn't /, this body 
I'm in. You don't think Martians 
would look exactly like humans, do 
you? I'm three feet tall, weigh what 
would be about, twenty pounds here 
on Earth. I have four arms with sixfingered hands. This body I'm in — 
it frightens me. I don't understand 
it, any more than I know how I got 
here." 

"Or how you happen to talk English? Or can you account for that?" 

"Well — in a way I can. This 
body; its name is Howard Wilcox. 
It's a bookkeeper. It's married to a 
female of this species. It works at a 
place called the Humbert Lamp 
Company. I've got all its memories 
and I can do everything it could do; 
I know everything it knew, or 
knows. In a sense, I am Howard 
Wilcox. I've got stuff in my pockets 
to prove it. But it doesn't make 
sense, because I'm Yangan Dal, and 
I'm a Martian. I've even got this 
body's tastes. I like beer. And if I 
think about this body's wife, I — 
well, I love her." 

I stared at him and pulled out my 
cigarettes, held out the package to 
him. "Smoke?" 

"This body — Howard Wilcox — 
doesn't smoke. Thanks, though. And 
let me buy us another round of 
beers. There's money in these 
pockets." 

I signaled Barney. 



"When did this happen? You say 
only two hours ago? Did you ever 
suspect before- then that you were a 
Martian?" 

"Suspect? I was a Martian What 
time is it?" 

I looked at Barney's clock. "A 
little after nine." 

"Then it's a little longer than I 
thought. Three and a half hours. It 
would have been half past five when 
I found myself in this body, because 
it was going home from work then, 
and from its memories I know it had 
left work half an hour before then, 
at five." 

"And did you — it — go home?" 

"No, I was too confused. It 
wasn't my home. I'm a Martian. 
Don't you understand that? Well, I 
don't blame you if you don't, because 
I don't, either. But I walked. And 
I — I mean Howard Wilcox — got 
thirsty and he — I — " He stopped 
and started over again. "This body 
got thirsty and I stopped in here for 
a drink. After two or three beers, I 
thought maybe the bartender there 
could give me some advice and I 
started talking to him." 

I LEANED forward across the 
table. "Listen, Howard," I said, 
"you were due home for dinner. 
You're making your wife worry like 
anything about you unless you 
phoned her. Did you?" 

"Did I — ■ Of course not. I'm not 
Howard Wilcox." But a new type 
of worry came into his face. 

"You'd better phone her," I said.

"What's there to lose? Whether you 
are Yangan Dal or Howard Wilcox, 
there's a woman sitting home worrying about you or him. Be kind 
enough to phone her. Do you know 
the number?" 

"Of course. It's my own — I mean 
it's Howard Wilcox's — " 

"Quit tying yourself into grammatical knots and go make that 
phone call. Don't worry about thinking up a story yet; you're too confused. Just tell her you'll explain 
when you get home, but that you're 
all right." 

He got up like a man in a daze 
and headed for the phone booth. 

I went over to the bar and had 
another quickie, straight. 

Barney said, "Is he — uh — " 

"I don't know yet," I said. 
"There's something about it I still 
don't get." 

IGOT-back to the booth. 
He was grinning weakly. He 
said, "She sounded madder than hoptoads. If I — if Howard Wilcox does 
go home, his story had better be 
good." He took a gulp of beer. 
"Better than Yangan Dai's story, 
anyway." He was getting more hu. man by the moment. 

But then he was back into it again. 
He stared at me. "I maybe should 
have told you how it happened from 
the beginning. I was shut up in a 
room on Mars. In the city of Skar. 
I don't know why they put me 
there, but they did. I was locked in. 
And then for a long time they , 

THE LAST MARTIAN 



didn't bring me food, and I got so 
hungry that I worked a stone loose 
from the floor and started to scrape 
my way ' through the door. I was 
starving. It took me three days — 
Martian days, about six Earth days 
—to get through, and I staggered 
around until I found the food quarters of the building I was in. There 
was no one there and I ate. And 
then — " 

. "Go on," I said. "I'm listening." 

"I went out of the building and 
everyone was lying in the open, in 
the streets, dead. Rotting." He put ' 
his hands over his eyes. "I looked 
in some houses, other buildings. I 
don't know why or what I was looking for, but nobody had died indoors. Everybody was lying dead in 
the open, and none of the bodies 
were withered, so it wasn't kryl that 
killed them. 

"Then, as I told you, I stole the 
targan — or I guess I really didn't 
steal it, because there was no one to 
steal it from — and flew around looking for someone alive. Out in the 
country it was the same way — everybody lying in the open, near the 
houses, dead. And Undanel and 
Zandar, the same. , 

"Did I tell you Zandar's the biggest city, the capital? In the middle 
of Zandar there's a big open space, 
the Games Field, that's more than 
an Earth-mile square. And all the 
people in Zandar were there, or it 
looked like all. Three million bodies, 
all lying together, like they'd gathered there to die, out in the open. 

149 



Like they'd known. Like everyone, 
everywhere else, was out in the 
open, but here they were all together, the whole three million of 
them. 

"I saw it from the air, as I flew 
over the city. And there was something in the middle of the field, on 
a platform. I went down and hovered the targan — it's a little 
like your helicopters, I forgot 
to mention — I hovered over the 
platform to see what was there. It 
was some kind of a column made of 
solid copper. Copper on Mars is 
like gold is on Earth. There was a 
push-button set with precious stones 
set in the column. And a Martian 
in a blue robe lay dead at the foot 
of the column, right under the button. As though he'd pushed it — and 
then died. And everybody else had 
died, too, with him. Everybody on 
Mars, except me. 

"And I lowered the targan onto 
■the platform and got out and I 
pushed the button. I wanted to die, 
too; everybody else was dead and I 
wanted to die, too. But I didn't. I 
was riding on a streetcar on Earth, 
on my way home from work, and ' 
my name was — " 

I signaled Barney. 

"Listen, Howard," I said. "We'll 
have one more beer and then you'd 
better get home to your wife. 
You'll catch hell from her, even 
now, and the longer you wait, the 
worse it'll be. And if you're smart, 
you'll take some candy or flowers 
along and think up a really good 



story on the way home. And not the 
one you. just told me." 

He said, "Well—" 

I said, "Well me no wells. Your 
name is Howard Wilcox and you'd 
better get home to your wife. I'll 
tell you what may have happened. 
We know little about the human 
mind, and many strange things happen to it. Maybe the medieval people 
had something when they believed 
in possession. Do you want to know 
what I think happened to you?" 

"What? For Heaven's sake, if you 
can give me any explanation — except tell me that I'm crazy — " 

"I think, you can drive yourself 
batty if you let yourself think about 
it, Howard. Assume there's some 
natural explanation and then forget 
it. I can make a random guess what 
may have happened." 

BARNEY came with the beers and 
•I waited until he'd gone back 
to the bar. 

I said, "Howard, just possibly a 
man — I mean a Martian — named 
Yangan Dal did die this afternoon 
on Mars. Maybe he really was the 
last Martian. And maybe, somehow, 
his mind got mixed up with yours 
at the moment of his death. I'm not 
saying that's what happened, but it 
isn't impossible to believe. Assume 
it was that, Howard, and fight it 
off. Just act as though you are Howard Wilcox — and look in a mirror if 
you doubt it. Go home and square 
things- with your wife, and then go 
to work tomorrow morning and for

get it. Don't you think that's the 
best idea?" 

"Well, maybe you're right. The 
evidence of my senses — " 

"Accept it. Until and unless you 
get better evidence." 

We finished off our beers and T 
put him into a taxi. I reminded him 
to stop for candy or flowers and to 
work up a good and reasonable alibi, 
instead of thinking about what he'd 
been telling me. 

I WENT back upstairs in the Trib 
building and into Cargan's office 
and closed the door behind me. 

I said, "It's all right, Cargan. I 
straightened him out." 
"What had happened?" 
"He's a Martian, all right. And 
he was the last Martian left on 
Mars. Only he didn't know we'd 
come here; he thought we were all 
dead." 

"But how — How could he have 
been overlooked? How could he not 
have known?" 

I said, "He's an imbecile. He was 
in a mental institution in Skar and 
somebody slipped up and left him 
in his room when the button was 
pushed that sent us here. He wasn't 
out in the open, so he didn't get the 
mentaport rays that carried our 
psyches across space. He escaped 
from his room and found the pkt 7 
form in Zandar, where the ceremony 
was, and pushed the button himself. 
There must have been enough juice 
left to send him after us." 

Cargan whistled softly. "Did you 



tell him the truth? And is he smart 
enough to keep his trap shut?" 

I shook my head. "No, to both 
questions. His I. Q. is about fifteen, 
at a guess. But that's as smart as 
the average Earthman, so he'll get by 
here all right. I convinced him he 
really was the Earthman his psyche 
happened to get into." 

"Lucky thing he went into Barney's. I'll phone Barney in a minute 
and let him know it's taken care of. 
I'm surprised he didn't give the guy 
a mickey before he phoned us." 

I said, "Barney's one of us. He 
wouldn't have let the guy get out 
of there. He'd have held him till we 
got there." 

"But you let him go. Are you sure 
it's safe? Shouldn't you have — " 

"He'll be all right," I said. "HI 
assume responsibility to keep an eye 
on him until we take over. I suppose 
we'll have to institutionalize . him 
again after that. But I'm glad I 
didn't have to kill him. After all, 
he is one of us, imbecile or not. And 
he'll probably be so glad to learn 
he isn't the last Martian that he 
won't mind having to return to an 
asylum." 

I went back into the cky room 
and to my desk. Slepper was gone, 
sent out somewhere, on something. 
Johnny Hale looked up from the 
magazine he was reading. "Get a 
story?" he asked. 

"Nah," I said. "Just a drunk being the life of the party. I'm surprised at Barney for calling."
