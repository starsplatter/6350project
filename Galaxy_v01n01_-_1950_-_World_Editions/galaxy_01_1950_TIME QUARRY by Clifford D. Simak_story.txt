TIME QUARRY by Clifford D. Simak

THE man came out of the twilight when the greenish-yellow of the sun's last glow 
still lingered in the west. He paused 
at the edge of the patio and called. 
"Mr. Adams, is that you?" 
The chair creaked as Christopher 
Adams shifted his weight, startled 
by the voice. Then he remembered. 



A new neighbor had moved in 
across the meadow a day or two ago. 
Jonathon had told him . . . and 
Jonathon knew all the gossip within 
a hundred miles. Human gossip as 
well as android and robot gossip. 

"Come on in," said Adams. "Glad 
you dropped around." 

He hoped his voice sounded as 



TIME QUARRY

hearty and neighborly as he had 
tried to make it. For he wasn't glad. 
He was a little nettled, upset by this 
sudden shadow that came out of the 
twilight and walked across the patio. 

This is my hour, he thought angrily. The one hour I give myself. 
The hour that I forget . . . forget 
the thousand problems that have to 
do with other star systems. Forget 
them and turn back to the greenblackness and the hush and the 
subtle sunset shadow-show that belong to my own •planet. For here, 
on this patio, there are no mentophone reports, no robot files, no 
'galactic co-ordination conferences 
... no psychological intrigue, no 
alien reaction charts. Nothing complicated or - mysterious. 

With half his mind, he knew the 
stranger had come across the patio 
and was reaching out a hand for a 
chair to sit in; and with the other 
half, once again, he wondered about 
the blackened bodies lying on the 
river bank on' far-off Aldebaran XII, 
and the twisted machine that was 
wrapped around the tree. 

Three humans had died there . . . 
three humans and two androids, and 
androids were almost human, different only in that they were manufactured instead of born. And humans 
must not die by violence unless it 
be by the violence of another human. 
Even then it must be on the field of 
honor, with all the formality and 
technicality of the code duello, or in 
the less polished affairs of revenge' 
or execution. 



For human life was sacrosanct. It 
had to be or there'd be no human 
life. Man was so pitifully outnumbered. 

Violence or accident ? 

And accident was ridiculous. 

There were few accidents, almost 
none at all. The near-perfection of 
mechanical performance, the almost 
human intelligence and reactions of 
machines to any known danger, long 
ago had cut accidents to an almost 
non-existent figure. 

No modern machine would be 
crude enough to crash into a tree. A 
more subtle, less apparent danger, 
maybe. But never a tree. 

So it must be violence. 

And it could not be .human violence, for human violence would 
have advertised the fact. Human 
violence had nothing to fear . . . 
there was no recourse to law, scarcely a moral code to which a human 
killer would be answerable. 

THREE humans dead, fifty light 
years distant, and it became a 
thing of great importance to a man 
sitting on his patio on Earth. A 
thing of prime importance, for no 
human must die by other hands 
than human without a terrible vengeance. Human life must not be 
taken without a monstrous price anywhere in the galaxy, or the human 
race would end forever, and the 
great galactic brotherhood of intelligence would plummet down into 
the darkness and the distance that 
had scattered it before.

Adams slumped lower in his 
chair, forcing himself to relax, 
furious at himself for thinking . . ; 
for it was his rule that in this time 
of twilight he thought of nothing 
... or as close to nothing as his 
restless mind could manage. 

The stranger's voice seemed to 
come from far away and yet Adams 
knew he was sitting at his side. 

"Nice evening," the stranger said. 

Adams chuckled. "The evenings 
are always nice. The Weather boys 
don't let it rain until later on, when 
everyone's asleep." 

In a thicket down the hill, a 
thrush struck up its evensong and 
the liquid notes ran like a quieting 
hand across a drowsing world. 
Along the creek a frog or two were 
trying out their throats. Far away, 
in some dim other-world, a whippoor-will began his chugging question. Across the meadow and up the 
climbing hills, the lights came on 
in houses here and there. 

"This is the best part of the day," 
said Adams. 

HE DROPPED his hand into his 
pocket, brought out tobacco 
pouch and pipe. "Spioke?" 

The stranger shook his head. "As 
a matter of fact, I am here on business." 

Adams' voice turned crisp. "See 
me in the morning, then. I don't do 
business after hours." 

The stranger said softly: "It's 
about Asher Sutton." 

Adams' body tensed and his fin


gers shook as he filled his pipe. He 
was glad that it was dark so the 
stranger could not see. 

"Sutton will be coming back," 
the stranger said. 

Adams shook his head. "No 
chance. He went out twenty years 
ago." 

"You haven't crossed him off?" 

"No," said Adams slowly. "He 
still is on the payroll, if that is 
what you mean." 

"Why?" asked the man. "Why do 
you keep him on?" 

Adams tamped the tobacco in the 
bowl, considering. "Sentiment, I 
guess. Faith in Asher Sutton. Although the faith is running out." 

"Just five days from now," the 
stranger said, "Sutton will come 
back." He paused a moment, then 
added: "Early in the morning." 

"There's no way you could know 
a thing like that." 

"But I do. It's recorded fact." 

Adams snorted. "It hasn't happened yet." ■ 

"In my time it has." 

Adams jerked upright in his chair. 
"In four time?" ', 

"Yes," said the stranger quietly. 
"You see, Mr. Adams, I am your 
successor." 

"Look here, young man. ■. . ." 

"Not young man. I am half again 
your age. I am getting old." 

"I have no successor," said Adams 
coldly. "There's been no talk of one. 
I'm good for another hundred years. 
Maybe more than that." 

"Yes," the stranger said, "for 



TIME QUARRY 



more than a hundred years. For 
much more than that." 

Adams leaned back quietly in his 
chair. He put his pipe in his mouth 
and lit it with a hand that was suddenly steady. 

"Let's take this easy," he said. 
"You say you are my successor . . . 
(that you took over my job after I 
quit or died. That means you came 
out of the future. Not that I believe 
you for a moment, of course. But 
just for argument. . . ." 

"There, was a news item the other 
day," the stranger said. "About a 
man named Michaelson who claimed 
he went into the future." 

"I read that. One second! How 
could a man know he went one second into time? How could he measure it and know? What difference 
would it make?" 

"None," the stranger agreed. 
"Not the first time. But the next 
time he will go into the future five 
seconds. Five seconds, Mr. Adams. 
Five tickings of the clock. The space 
of one short breath. There must be 
a starting point for all things." 

"Time travel?" 

The stranger nodded. 

"I don't believe it," Adams said. 
"In the last five thousand years we 
have conquered the galaxy. . . ." 

"Conquer is not the right word, 
Mr. Adams." 

"Well, taken over, then. Moved 
in. However you wish it. And we 
have found strange things. Stranger 
things than we ever dreamed. But 
never time travel." He waved his 



hand at the stars. "In all that space 
out there, no one had time travel. 
No one.'? 

"You have it now," the stranger 
said. "Since two weeks ago. Michaelson went into time, one second 
into time. A start. That is all that's 
needed." 

"All right," said Adams. "Let us 
say you are the man who in a hundred years or so will take my place. 
Let's pretend you traveled back in 
time. Then why come here?" 

"To tell you that Asher Sutton 
will return." 

"I would know it when he came," 
said Adams. "Why must I know 
now?" 

"When he returns," the stranger 
said, "Sutton must be killed." 

II 

THE tiny, battered ship sank 
lower, slowly, like a floating 
feather, drifting down toward the 
field in the slant of morning sun. 
The bearded, ragged man in the 
pilot's chair sat tensed, not breathing. 

Tricky, said his brain. Hard and 
tricky to handle so much weight, to 
judge the distance and the speed . 
hard to make the tons of metal float 
down against the savage pull of 
gravity. Harder even than the lifting 
of it, when there had been no consideration but that it should rise and 
move out into space. 

For a moment the ship wavered 
and he fought it with every shred 



8 




 



of will and mind . . . and then it 
floated once again, hovering just a 
few feet above the surface of the 
field. 

He let it down, gently, so that it 
scarcely bumped when it touched the 
ground. 

He sat rigid in the seat, slowly 
going limp, relaxing by inches, first 
one muscle, then another. Tired, he 
told himself. The toughest job I've 
ever done. Another few miles and 
I would have let the whole weight 
of the ship crash. 

Far down the field was a clump 
of buildings. A ground car had 
swung away from them and was racing down the strip toward him. A 
breeze curled in through the shattered vision port and touched his 
face, reminding him. . . . 

Breathe, he told himself. You 
must be breathing when they come. 
You must be breathing and you must 
walk out and you must smile at 
them. There must be nothing they 
will notice. Right away, at least. 
The beard and" clothes will help 
some. They'll be so busy gaping at 
them that . they will miss a little 
thing. But not breathing. They might 
notiqe if you weren't breathing. 

Carefully, he pulled in a breath 
of air, felt the sting of it run along 
his nostrils and gush inside his 
throat, felt the fire of it 'when it 
reached his lungs. 

Another breath and another one 
and the air had scent and life and a 
strange exhilaration. The blood 
throbbed in his throat and beat 



against his temples and he held his 
fingers to one wrist and felt it pulsing there. 

Sickness came, a brief, stomachretching sickness that he fought 
against, holding his body rigid, remembering all the things that he 
must do. The power of will, he told 
himself, the power of mind . . . 
the power that no man uses to its 
full capacity. The will to tell a body 
the things that it must do, the power 
to start an engine turning after years 
of doing nothing. 

One breath and then another. And 
the heart is beating now, steadier, 
steadier. 

Be quiet, stomach. 

Get going, liver. 

Keep pumping, heart. 

It isn't as if you were old and. 
rusted, for you never were. The 
other system took care that you were 
kept in shape, that you were ready 
at an instant's notice to be as you 
were. 

But the switch-over was a shock. 
He had known that it would be. 
He had dreaded its coming, for he 
had known what it would mean: the 
agony of a new kind of life and 
metabolism. 

IN HIS mind he held a blueprint 
of his body and all its working 
parts ... a shifting, wpbbly picture 
that shivered and blurred and ran 
color into color. But it steadied under the hardening of his mind, the 
driving of his will, and finally the 
blueprint was still and sharp and

bright and he knew that the worst 
was over. 

He clung to the ship's controls 
with hands clenched so fiercely, they 
almost dented metal, and perspiration poured down his body, and he 
was Jimp and weak. Nerves grew 
quiet and the Wood pumped on, and 
he knew that he was breathing without even thinking of it. 

For a moment longer he sat quietly in the seat, relaxing. The breeze 
came in the shattered port and 
brushed against his cheek. The 
ground car was coming very close. 

"Johnny," he whispered, "we are 
home. We made it. This is my home, 
Johnny. The place I talked about." 

But there was no answer, just a 
stir of comfort deep inside his brain, 
a strange, nestling comfort such as 
one may know when one is eight 
years old and snuggles into bed. 

"Johnny!" he cried. 

And he felt the stir again ... a 
self-assuring stir like the feel of a 
dog's muzzle against a hand. 

Someone was beating at the ship's 
door, beating with fists and crying 
out. 

"All right," said Asher Sutton. 
"I'm coming. I'll be right along." 

fie reached down and lifted the 
attache case from beside the seat, 
tucked ■ it underneath his arm. He 
went to the lock and twirled it open 
and stepped out on the ground. 

There was only one man. 

"Hello," said Asher Sutton. 

"Welcome to Earth, sir," said the 
man, and the "sir" struck a chord of 



memory. Sutton's eyes went to the 
man's forehead and he saw the tattooing of the serial number, the 
only indication that this was a synthetic human being, an android. 

Sutton had forgotten about androids. Perhaps a lot of other things 
as we'll. Little habit patterns that had 
sloughed away with the span of 
twenty years. 

HE SAW the android staring at 
him, at the naked knee showing through the worn cloth, at the 
lack of shoes. 

"Where I've been," said Sutton, 
sharply, "you couldn't buy a new 
suit every day." 

"No, sir," said the android. 
"And the beard," said Sutton, "is 
because I had nothing to shave 
with." 

"I've seen beards before," the 
android told him. 

Sutton stood quietly and stared at 
the world before him ... at the 
upthrust of towers shining in the 
morning sun, at the green of park 
and meadow, at the darker green of 
trees and the blue and scarlet 
splashes of flower gardens on sloping terraces. 

He took a deep breath and felt 
the air flooding in his lungs, seeking 
out all the distant cells Jhat had been 
starved so long. And it was coming 
back to him, coming back again . . . 
the remembrance of life on Earth, 
of early morning sun and flaming 
sunsets, of deep blue sky and dew 
upon the grass, the swift blur of 



10 




 



human talk and the lilt of human 
music. 

"The car is- waiting, sir," the 
android said. "I will take you to a 
human." 

"I'd rather walk," said Sutton. 

THE android shook his head. 
"The human is waiting and he 
is most impatient." 

"Oh, all right," said Sutton. 
The seat was soft and he sank 
into it gratefully, cradling the attache case carefully in his lap. He 
stared out of the window, fascinated by the green of Earth. The 
green fields of Earth, he said. Or 
was it the green vales? No matter 
now. It was a song written long 
ago, in the time when there had 
been fields on Earth, instead of 
parks, when Man had turned the 
soil for more important things than 
flower beds. In the day, thousands 
of years before, When Man had just 
begun to feel the stir of space within 
his soul. Long years before Earth 
had become the capital, and the center of galactic empire. 

A great starship was taking off 
at the far end of the field, sliding 
down the ice-smooth plastic skidway with the red-hot flare of booster 
jets frothing in its tubes. Its nose 
slammed into the upward curve of 
the take-off ramp and it was away, 
a rumbling streak of silver that shot 
into the blue. For a moment it flickered a golden red in the morning 
sunlight, and then was gone, van, ished. 



SUTTON brought his gaze back 
to Earth again, sat soaking in 
the sight of it as a man soaks in 
the first strong sun of spring after 
months of winter. 

Far to the north towered the twin 
spires of the Justice Bureau, Alien 
Branch. And to the east the pile of 
gleaming plastics and glass that was 
the University of North America. 
And other buildings that he had 
forgotten . . . buildings for which 
he found he had no name, miles 
apart, with parks and homesites in 
between. The homes were masked 
by trees and shrubbery— none sat in 
barren loneliness — and, through the 
green of the curving hills, Sutton 
caught the glints of color that were 
roofs and walls. 

The car slid to a stop before the 
Administration Building and the 
android opened the door. "This 
way, sir." 

Only a few chairs in the lobby 
were occupied and most of those by 
humans. Humans or androids, 
thought Sutton, you can't tell the 
difference until you see their foreheads. 

The sign upon the forehead, the 
brand of manufacture. The telltale 
mark that said: "This man is not a 
human, although he looks like one." 

These are the ones who will listen 
to me. These are the ones who will 
pay attention. These are the ones 
who will save me against any future 
enmity that Man may raise against 
me. 

For they are worse than the dis

inherited. They are not the hasbeens; they ^are the never-weres. 
They are not born of woman, but of 
the laboratory. Their, mother is a 
bin of chemicals and their father 
the irigenuity and technology of the 
creator race. 

Android: An artificial human. A 
human made in the laboratory out 
of Man's own knowledge of chemicals and atomic and molecular structure and the strange reaction that is 
known as life. 

Human in all but two respects — 
the mark upon the forehead and the 
ability to reproduce biologically. 

Artificial humans to help the real 
humans, the biological humans, to 
carry the load of galactic empire, 
to make the thin line of humanity 
stronger, thicker. But kept in their 
place. Oh, yes, most definitely kept 
in their rightful place by psychoconditioning and savagely enforced 
"rules and laws. 

THE corridor was empty. Sutton, 
his bare feet slapping on the 
floor, followed the android. 

The door before which they 
stopped said: 

THOMAS H. DAVIS 
(Human) 
Operations Chief 

"In there," the android said. 

Sutton walked in and the man 
behind the desk looked up. 

"I'm a human," Sutton told him. 
"I may not look it, but I am." 



The man jerked his thumb toward 
a chair. "Sit down." 
Sutton sat. 

"Why didn't you answer our signals?" Davis asked. 

"My set was broken." 

"Your ship has no identity." 

"The rains washed it off," said 
Sutton, "and I had no paint." 

"Rain doesn't wash off paint." 

"Not Earth rain. Where I was, 
it does." 

"Your motors?" asked Davis. 
"We could pick up nothing from 
them." 

"They weren't working." 

Davis' Adam's apple bobbed up 
and down. "Weren't working? How 
did you navigate?" 

"With energy," said Sutton. 

"Energy. . . ." 

Sutton stared at him icily. "Anything else you want to know?". 

Davis was confused. The answers 
were all wrong. He fiddled with a 
pencil. "Just the usual things, I 
guess." He drew a pad of forms before him. 

"Name ?" 

"Asher Sutton." 

"Origin of fli — Say, wait a minute! Asher Sutton?" 
"That's right." 

Davis flung the pencil on the 
desk, pushed away the pad. "Why 
didn't you tell me that first?"' 

"I didn't have a chance." 

Davis was flustered. "If I had 
known. . . ." 

"It's the beard," said Sutton. 

"My father talked about you 



12 




 



often. Jim Davis. Maybe you remember him.". 

Sutton shook his head. 

"Great friend of your father's. 
That is . . . they more or less knew 
one another." y 

"How is my father?" asked Sutton. 

"Great," said Davis enthusiastically. "Getting along in years, but 
standing up. . . ." 

"My father and mother," Sutton 
told him coldly, "died forty years 
ago. In the Argus pandemic." He 
heaved himself to his feet, faced 
Davis squarely. "If you're through, 
I'd like to go to my hotel. They'll 
find some room for me." 

"Certainly, Mr. Sutton, certainly. 
Which hotel?" 

"The Orion Arms." 

Davis reached into a drawer, took 
out a directory, nipped the pages, 
ran a shaking finger down a column. 

"Cherry 26-3489," he said. "The 
teleport 5s over there." 

He pointed to a booth set flush 
into the wall, where a dematerializer could transport matter instantly 
to any other teleport booth anywhere on Earth. 

"Thanks," said Sutton. 

"About your father, Mr. Sutton. . . r 

"I know," said Sutton. "I'm glad 
you tipped me off." 

He swung around and walked to 
the teleport. Before he closed the 
door, he looked back. 

Davis was on the visaphone, talking rapidly. 



Ill 

TWENTY, years had not changed 
the Orion Arms. 
To Sutton, stepping out of the 
teleport, it looked the same as the 
day he had walked away. A little 
shabbier, but it was home, the quiet 
whisper of hushed activity, the 
dowdy furnishings, the finger-to-the 
lip, tiptoe atmosphere, the stiff respectability that he had remembered 
and dreamed about in the long years 
of alienness. 

The life mural along the wall was 
the same as ever. A little faded now, 
but the same goatish Pan still 
chased, after twenty years, the same 
terror-stricken maiden across the 
self-same hills and dales. And the 
same rabbit hopped from behind a 
bush and watched the chase with all 
his customary boredom, chewing his 
everlasting cud of clover. 

The self-adjusting furniture, 
bought before the management had 
considered throwing the hostelry 
open to the unhuman trade, had 
been out-of-date twenty years ago. 
But it still was there. It had been 
repainted, in soft, genteel pastels, 
its self-adjustment features still confined to human forms. 

The spongy floor covering had 
lost some of its sponginess, and the 
Cetian cactus must have died at last, 
for a pot of frankly Terrestial geraniums now occupied its place. 

The clerk snapped off the visaphone and turned back to the room. 
"Good morning, Mr. Sutton," he 



TIME QUARRY 



13 



said, in his cultured android voice. 
Then he added, almost as an afterthought: "We've been wondering 
when you would show up." 

"Twenty years," said Sutton drily, 
"is a long time to wonder." 

"We've kept your old suite for 
you. We knew you would want it. 
Mary has kept it cleaned and ready 
for you ever since you left." 

"That was nice of you, Ferdinand." 

"You've hardly changed at all. 
Just the beard. I knew you the second that I turned and saw you." 

"The beard and clothes," said 
Sutton. "The clothes are pretty 
bad." 

"I don't suppose you have lug : 
gage, Mr. Sutton." 

"No. Could I get something to 
eat?" 

"Breakfast, perhaps? We still are 
serving breakfast. You always liked 
scrambled eggs for breakfast." 

"That sounds all right," said Sutton. "Send them up with a change 
of clothes." 

He turned slowly 'from the desk 
and walked to the elevator. He was 
about to close the door when a voice 
called: "Just a moment, please." 

The girl was running across the 
lobby. Rangy and copper-haired, she 
slid into the lift, pressed her back 
against the wall. 

"Thanks very much," she said. 
"Thanks so much for waiting." 

Her skin, Sutton saw, was magnolia-white and her eyes were granite-colored with shadows deep 



within them. He closed the door 
softly. "I was glad to wait," he said. 
Her lips twitched just a little, and 
he added, "I don't like shoes. They 
cramp my feet." 

He pressed the button savagely 
and the lift sprang upward. The 
lights ticked off the floors. Sutton 
stopped the cage. "This is my 
floor," he said. 

HE HAD the door open and was 
halfway out, when she spoke to 
him. "Mister." 

"Yes, what is it?" 
"I didn't mean to laugh. I reallytruly didn't." 

"You had a right to laugh," said 
Sutton, and closed the door behind 
him. He stood for a moment, fighting down a sudden tenseness that 
seized him like a mighty fist. 

Careful, he told himself, take it 
easy, boy. You are home at last. This 
is the place you dreamed of. Just a 
few doors down and you are finally 
home. You will reach out and turn 
the knob and push open the door 
and it will be there, just as you remembered it. The favorite chair, the 
life-paintings on the wall, the little 
fountain with the mermaids from 
Venus, and the windows where you 
can sit and fill your eyes with Earth. 

But you can't get emotional. You 
can't go soft and scared. 

For that chap back at the spaceport lied. And hotels don't keep 
rooms waiting for all of twenty 
years. 

There is something wrong. I don't 



14 




 



know what, but something. Something terribly wrong. 

He took a slow step . . . and then 
another, fighting down the tension, 
swallowing the dryness of excitement 
welling in his throat. 

One of the paintings, he remembered, was a forest brook, with birds 
flitting in the trees. And at the most 
unexpected times one of the birds 
would sing, usually with the dawn 
or the going of the sun. And the 
water babbled with a happy song 
that held one listening. 

He knew that he was running and 
he didn't try to stop. His lingers 
curled around the door knob and 
turned it. 

The room was there ... the 
favorite chair, . the babble of the 
brook, the splashing of the mermaids. ... 

He caught the whiff of danger 
as he stepped across the threshold 
and he tried to turn and run, but he 
was too late. He felt his body 
crumpling forward to crash toward 
the floor. 

"Johnny!" he cried and the cry 
bubbled in his throat. "Johnny!" 

Inside his brain a voice whispered 
back: "It's all right, Ash. We're still 
joined." 

Then darkness came. 

IV 

THERE was someone in the room 
and Sutton kept- his eyelids 
down, kept his breathing slow. 
Someone in the room was pacing 



quietly, stopping now before the 
window to look out, moving over to 
the mantlepiece to stare at the painting of the forest brook. And in the 
'stillness of the room, Sutton heard 
the laughing babble of the painted 
stream against the splashing of the 
fountain, heard the faint bird notes 
that came from the painted trees, 
imagined that even from the distance that Tie lay he could smell the 
forest mold and the cool, wet perfume of the moss that grew along 
the stream.
The person in the room crossed 
back again and sat down in a chair. 
He whistled a tune, almost inaudibly. A funny, little lilting tune that 
Sutton had not heard before. 

Someone gave me a going over, 
Sutton told himself. Knocked me 
out fast, with gas or powder, then 
gave me an overhauling. I seem to 
remember some of it . . . hazy and 
far away. Lights that glowed and a 
probing at my brain. And I might 
have fought against it, but I knew 
it was no use. And, besides, they're 
welcome to anything they found. 
Yes, they're welcome to anything 
they pried out of my mind. But 
they've found all they're going to 
find and they have gone away. They 
left someone to watch me and he 
still, is in the room, waiting for me • 
to wake up, probably. 

Sutton- stirred on the bed and 
opened his eyes, kept them glazed 
and only partly focused. 

The man rose from the chair and ' 
Sutton saw that - he was dressed in

white. He crossed the room and 
leaned above the bed. 

"All right now?" he asked. 

Sutton raised a hand and passed 
it, bewildered, across his face. "Yes," 
I guess I am." 

"You passed out," the man said. 

"Something I forgot to eat." 

THE man shook his head. "The 
trip, probably. It must have 
been a tough one." 

"Yes," said Sutton. "Tough." 
Go ahead, he thought. Go ahead 
and ask some more. Those are your 
instructions. Catch me while I'm 
groggy, pump me like a well. Go 
ahead and ask the questions and 
earn your lousy money. 

But he was wrong. The man 
straightened up. "I think you'll be 
all right," he said. "If you aren't, 
call me. My card is ori the mantle." 
"Thanks, doctor," said Sutton. 
He. watched him walk across the 
room, waited until he heard the door 
click, then sat up in bed. His clothing lay in a pile in the center of the 
floor. His case? Yes, there it was, 
lying on a chair. Ransacked, no 
doubt, probably photostated. Spy 
rays, too, more than likely. All over 
the room. Ears listening and eyes 
watching. 

But who? he asked himself. No 
one knew he was returning. No one 
could have known. Not even Adams. 
There was no way to know. There 
had been no way that he could let 
them know. 

Funny. Funny the way Davis at 



the spaceport had recognized his 
name and told a lie to cover up. 
Funny the way Ferdinand pretended 
his suite had been kept for him for 
all these twenty years. Funny, too, 
how Ferdinand had turned around 
and spoken, as if twenty years were 
nothing. 

Organized, said Sutton. Clicking 
like a relay system. Set and waiting. 
But why should anyone be waiting? 
No one knew when he'd be coming 
back. Or if he would come at all. 

And even if someone did know, 
why go to all the trouble ? 

For they could not know, he 
thought . . . they could not know 
the thing I have, they could not even 
guess. Even if they did know I was 
coming back, incredible as it might 
be that they should know, even that 
would be more credible by a million 
times than that they should know 
the real reason for my coming. 

And knowing, ,he said, they would 
not believe. 

His eyes found the attache case 
lying on the chair, and Stared at it. 

And knowing, he said again, they 
would not believe. 

When they look the ship over, of 
course,' they will do some wondering. Then there might be some excuse for the thing that happened. 
But they didn't have time to look 
at the ship. They didn't wait a minute. They were laying for me and 
they gave me the works from the 
second that I landed. 

Davis shoved me into a teleport 
and grabbed his phone like mad. 




 



And Ferdinand knew that I was on 
:the way, he knew.he'd see me when 
he turned around. And the girl — 
the girl with the granite eyes? 

Sutton got up and stretched. A 
bath and shave, first of all, he told 
himself. And then some clothes and 
breakfast. A visor call or two. 

Don't act as if you've got the 
wind up, he warned himself. Act 
naturally. Talk to yourself. Pinch 
out a blackhead. Scratch your back 
against a door casing. Act as if you 
think you are alone. 

But be careful. 

There is someone watching. 

V 

SUTTON was finishing breakfast 
when the android came. 
"My name is Herkimer," the 
android told him, "and I belong to 
Mr. Geoffrey Benton." 

"Mr. Benton sent you here?" 
"Yes. He sends a challenge." 
"A challenge?" 
"Yes. You know, a duel." 
"But I am unarmed." 
"You cannot be unarmed," said 
Herkimer. 

"I never fought a duel in all my 
life," said Sutton. "I don't intend to 
now." 

"You are vulnerable." 
"What do you mean, vulnerable? 
If I go unarmed. . . ." 

"But you cannot go unarmed. The 
code was changed just a year or two 
ago. No man younger than a hundred years can go unarmed." 



"But if one does?" 

"Why, then," said Herkimer, 
"anyone who wants to can pot him 
like a rabbit." 

"You are sure of this?" 

Herkimer dug into his pocket, 
brought out a tiny book. He wet 
his finger and fumbled at the pages. 
"It's right here." 

"Never mind," said Sutton. "I 
will take your word." 

"You accept the challenge, then?" 

Sutton grimaced. "I suppose I 
have to. Mr. Benton will wait, I 
presume, until I buy a gun." 

"No need of that," Herkimer told 
him brightly. "I brought one along. 
Mr. Benton always does that. Just 
a courtesy, you know. In case someone hasn't got one." 

He reached into his pocket and 
held out the weapon. Sutton took it 
and laid it on the table. "Awkward 
looking thing," he said. 

Herkimer stiffened. "It's traditional. The finest weapon made. 
Shoots a .45 caliber slug. Handloaded ammunition. Sights are tested 
in for fifty feet." 

"You pull this?" asked Sutton, 
pointing. 

Herkimer nodded. "It is called a 
trigger. And you don't pull it. You 
squeeze it." 

"Just why does Mr. Benton challenge me?" asked Sutton. "I don't 
even know the man." 

"You are famous," said Herkimer. 

"Not that I have heard of." 
"You are an investigator," Herki

tner pointed out. "You have just 
come back from a long and perilous 
mission. You're carrying a mysterious attache case. And there are reporters waiting in the lobby to interview you." 

' Sutton nodded. "I see. When Benton kills someone, he likes him to 
be famous." 

' "Of course. More publicity." 

"But I don't know your Mr. Benton. How will I know who I'm 
supposed to shoot at?"' 

"I'll show you,' 1 said Herkimer, 
"on the televisor." He stepped to 
the desk, dialed a number and 
stepped back. "That's him." 

In the screen a man was sitting 
before a chess table. The pieces were 
in mid-game. Across the board stood 
a beautifully machined robotic. The 
man reached out a hand, thoughtfully played his knight. The jrobotic 
clicked and chuckled. It moved a 
pawn. Benton's shoulders hunched 
forward and he bent above the 
board. One hand came around and 
scratched the back of his neck. 

"Oscar's got him worried," said 
Herkimer. "He always has him worried. Mr. Benton hasn't won a single 
game in the last ten years." 

"Why does he keep on playing?" 

"Stubborn," said Herkimer. "But 
Oscar's stubborn, too." He made a 
motion with his hand., "Machines 
can be so much more stubborn than 
humans. It's the way they're built." 

"But Benton must have known, 
when he had Oscar fabricated, that 
Oscar would beat him," Sutton 



pointed out. "A human simply can't 
beat a robotic expert." 

"Mr. Benton knew that," said 
Herkimer, "but he didn't believe it. 
He wanted to prove otherwise." 
, "Egomaniac," said Sutton. 

Herkimer stared at him calmly. 
"I believe that you are right, sir. 
I've sometimes thought the same 
myself." 

SUTTON brought his gaze back to 
Benton, who was still hunched 
above the board, the knuckles of one 
hand thrust hard against his mouth. 
The veined face was scrubbed and 
pink and chubby and the brooding 
eyes,, thoughtful as they were, still 
held a fat twinkle of culture and 
good fellowship. 

"You'll know him now?" asked 
Herkimer. 

Sutton nodded. "Yes, I think I 
can pick him out. He doesn't look 
too dangerous." 

"He's killed sixteen men," Herkimer said stiffly. "He plans to lay 
away his guns when he makes it 
twenty-five." He looked straight at 
Sutton and said: "You're the seventeenth." 

"I'll try to make it easy for him." 

"How would you wish it, sir?" 
asked Herkimer. "Formal or informal?" 

"Let's make it catch-as-catch-can." 

Herkimer was disapproving. 
"There are certain conventions. . . ." 

"You can tell Mr. Benton," said 
Sutton, "that I don't plan to ambush 
him."

Herkimer picked up his cap, put 
it on his head. "The best of luck, 
sir." 

"Why, thank you, Herkimer," 
said Sutton. 

THE door closed and Sutton was 
alone. He turned back to the 
screen. Benton played to double up 
his rooks. Oscar chuckled at him, 
slid a bishop three squares along the 
board and put Benton's king in 
check. 

Sutton snapped the visor off. 

He scraped a hand across his nowshaved chin. 

Coincidence or plan? 

One of the mermaids had climbed 
to the edge of the fountain and balanced her three-inch self precariously. She whistled at Sutton. He turned 
at the sound and she dived into the 
pool, swam in circles, mocking him 
with obscene gestures. 

Sutton leaned forward, reached 
into the visor rack, brought out the 
INF-JAT directory, flipped the 
pages swiftly. 

INFORMATION— Terrestrial 
Culinary 
Culture 
Customs 

That would be it. Customs. 

He found DUELING, noted the 
' number and put back the book. He 
reset the dial and snapped the tumbler for direct communication. 

A robot's streamlined, metallic 
face filled the plate. "At your service, sir," it said. 



"I have been challenged to a 
duel," said Sutton. 

The robot waited for the question. 

"I don't want to fight a duel," 
said Sutton. "Is there any way, legally, for me to back out? I'd like 
to do it gracefully, too, but I won't 
insist on that." 

"There is no way," the robot said. 

"No way at all?" 

"You are under one hundred?" 
the robot asked. 

"Yes." 

"You are sound of mind and 
body?" 

"I think so." 

"You are or you aren't. Make up 
your mind." 

"I am," said Sutton. 

"You do not belong to any bona 
fide religion that prohibits killing?" 

"I presume I could classify myself as a Christian," said Sutton. 
"Isn't there a Commandment against 
killing?" 

The robot shook his head. "It 
doesn't count." 

"It's clear and specific," Sutton 
argued. "It says one should not kill." 

"It does," the robot told him. 
"But it has been discredited. You 
humans never obeyed it. You either 
obey a law or you forfeit it." 

"I guess I'm sunk then," said Sutton. 

"According to the revision of the 
year .7990," said the robot, "arrived 
at by convention, any human under 
the age of one hundred, of male sex, 
sound in mind and body, unhampered by religious bonds or belief,

which are subject to a court of inquiry, must fight a duel whenever 
challenged." 
"I see." 

"The history of dueling," said 
the robot, "is very interesting." 

"It's barbaric," said Sutton. 

"Perhaps so. But you humans are 
still barbaric in many , other ways as 
well." 

"You're impertinent." 

"I'm sick and tired," the robot 
said. "Sick and tired of the smugness of you humans. You say you've 
outlawed war and you haven't, 
really. You've just fixed it so no one 
dares to fight you. You say you have 
abolished crime and you have, excepOfor human crime. And a lot of 
the crime you have abolished isn't 
crime at- all, except by human standards." \ 

"You're taking a ' long chance, 
friend," warned Sutton, "talking the 
way you are." 

"You can pull the plug on me," 
the robot told him, "any time you 
want to. Life isn't worth it, the kind 
of job I have." 

HE SAW the look on Sutton's 
face and hurried on. 
"Try to see it this way, sir. 
Through all his history, Man has 
been a killer. He was smart and 
brutal, even from the first. He was 
a puny thing, but he found how to 
use a club and rocks, and when the 
rocks weren't sharp enough, he 
chipped them so they were. There 
were things, at first, he should not 



by rights have killed. They should 
have killed him. But he was smart 
and he had the dub and flints and 
he killed the mammoth and the 
sabertooth and other things he could 
not have faced bare-handed. So he 
won the Earth from the animals. He 
wiped them out, except the ones he 
allowed to live for the service that 
they gave him. And even as he 
fought with the animals, he fought 
with others of his kind. After the 
animals were gone, he kept on fighting .. . man against man, nation 
against nation." 

"But that is past," said Sutton. 
"There hasn't been a war for more 
than a thousand years. Humans have 
no need of fighting now." 

"That is just the point," the robot 
insisted. "There is no more need of 
fighting, no more need of killing. 
•Oh, once in a while, perhaps, on 
some far-off planet, where a human 
must kill to protect his\life or to uphold human dignity and power. But, 
by and large, there is no need of 
killing. 

"And yet you kill. You must kill. 
The old brutality is in you. You are 
drunk with power and killing is a 
sign of power. It has become a habit 
with you ... a thing you've carried 
from the caves. There's nothing left 
to kill but one another, so you kill 
one another and you call it dueling. 
You know it's wrong, and you're 
hypocritical about it. You've set up 
a fine system of semantics to make 
it sound respectable and brave and 
noble. You call it traditional and 



20 




 



chivalric . . . and even if you don't 
call it that in so many words, that 
is what you think. You cloak it with 
the trappings of your vicious past, 
you dress it up with words, and the 
words are only tinsel." 

"Look," said Sutton, "I don't 
want to fight this duel. I don't think 
it's. . . ." 

There was- vindictive glee in the 
robot's voice. "But you've got to 
fight it. There's no way to back out. 
Maybe you would like some pointers. I have all sorts of tricks. . . ." 

"I thought you didn't approve of 
dueling." 

"I don't," the robot said. "But 
it's my job. I'm stuck with it. I try 
to do it well. I can tell you the personal history of every man who ever 
fought a' duel. I can talk for hours 
on the advantages of rapiers over 
pistols. Or if you'd rather I argued 
for pistols, I can do that, too. I can 
tell you about the old American 
West gun slicks and the Chicago 
gangsters and the handkerchief and 
dagger duels and. . . ." 

"No, thanks," said Sutton. 

"You aren't interested?" 

"I haven't got the time." 

"But, sir," the robot pleaded, "I 
don't get a chance too often. I don't 
get many calls. Just an hour or 
so. . . ." 

"No," said Sutton firmly. 

"All right, then. Maybe you'd tell 
me who has challenged you." 

"Benton. Geoffrey Benton." 

The robot whistled. 

"Is he that good?" asked Sutton. 



"All of it," the robot said. 

Sutton shut the visor off. 

He sat quietly in his chair, staring 
at the gun. Slowly he reached out a 
hand and picked it up. The butt 
fitted snugly in his hand. His finger 
curled around the trigger. He lifted 
it and sighted at the door knob. 

It was easy to handle. Almost like 
it was a part of him. There was a 
feel of power within it ... of power 
and mastery. As if he suddenly were 
stronger and greater . . . and moredangerous. 

He sighed and laid it down. The 
robot had been right. 

He reached out to the visor, 
pushed the signal for the lobby 
desk. Ferdinand's face came in. 

"Anyone waiting down there for 
me, Ferdinand?" 

"Not a soul," said Ferdinand. 

"Anyone asked for me?" 

"No one, Mr. Sutton." 

"No reporters? No photographers?" 

"No, Mr. Sutton. Were you expecting them?" 

Sutton didn't answer. He cut off, 
feeling very silly. 

VI 

MAN was, spread thin throughout the galaxy. A lone man 
here, a handful there. Slim creatures 
of bone and brain and muscle to 
hold a galaxy in check. Slight shoulders to hold up the cloak of human 
greatness spread across the light 
years. 



TIME QUARRY 



21 



For Man had flown too fast, had 
driven far beyond his physical capacity. Not by strength did he hold 
his starry outposts, but by something 
else ... by depth of human character, by his colossal conceit, by his 
ferocious conviction that Man was 
the greatest living thing the galaxy 
had spawned. All this in spite of 
many evidences that he was not . . . 
evidence that he cast aside, scornful 
of any greatness that was not ruthless and aggressive. 

Too thin, Christopher Adam^ told 
himself. Too thin and stretched too 
far. One man backed by a dozen 
androids and a hundred robots could 
hold a solar system. Could hold it 
until there were more men or until 
something cracked. 

In time there'd be more men, if 
the birth rate increased. But it would 
be many centuries before the line 
could grow much thicker, for Man 
only held the keypoints . . . one 
planet in an entire system, and not 
in every system. Man had leapfrogged since there weren't men 
enough, had set up strategic spheres 
of influence, had bypassed all but 
the richest, most influential systems. 

THERE was room to spread, room 
for a million years. If there 
were any humans left by then. 

If the life on those other planets 
let the humans live, if there never 
came a day when they would be 
willing to pay the terrible price of 
wiping out mankind. 



The price would be high, said 
Adams, talking to himself, but it 
could be done. Just a few hours' 
job. Humans in the morning, no 
humans left by night. What if a 
thousand others died for every human death ... or ten thousand, or 
a hundred thousand? Under certain 
circumstances, such a price might 
be cheap. 

There were islands of resistance 
even now where one walked carefully ... or even walked around. 
Like 61 Cygni, for example. 

It took judgment . . . and some 
tolerance ... and a great measure 
of latent brutality, but, most of all, 
conceit, the absolute, unshakable 
conviction that Man was sacrosanct, 
that he could not be touched, that he 
could die only individually. 

But five had died, three humans 
and two androids, beside a river that 
flowed on Aldebaran XII, just a 
few short miles from Andrelon, the 
planetary capital. 

They had died of violence, of 
that there was no question. 

Adams' eyes sought out the paragraph of Thome's latest report: 

Force had been applied from the 
outside. We jound a hole burned 
through the atomic shielding of the 
engine. The force must have been 
controlled or it would have resulted 
in absolute destruction. The automatics got in their work and headed 
off the blast, but the machine went 
out of control and smashed into the 
tree. The area was saturated with 
intensive radiation. 



22 




 



Good man, Thome, thought 
Adams. He won't let a single thing 
be missed. He had those robots in 
there before the place was safe for 
humans. 

But there wasn't much to find . . . 
not much that gave an answer. Just 
a batch of question mirks. 

Five had died, and when that was 
said, that was the end of fact. For 
they were burned and battered and 
there were no features left, no fin. gerprints or eyeprints to match 
against the records. 

A few feet away from the strewn 
blackness of the bodies, the machine 
had smashed into a tree. A machine 
that, like the men, was without a 
record. A machine without a counterpart in the known galaxy and, so 
far at least, a machine without a 
purpose. 

Thome would give it the works. 
He would set it up in solidographs, 
down to the last shattered piece of 
glass and plastic. He would have it 
analyzed and diagramed and the 
robots would put it in scanners that 
would peel it and record it molecule 
by molecule. 

And they might find something. 
Just possibly they might. 

Adams shoved the report to one 
side and leaned back in his chair. 
Idly, he spelled out his name lettered across the office door, reading 
backward slowly and with exaggerated care. As if he'd never seen the 
name before. As if he did not know 
it. Puzzling it out. 

And then the line beneath it: 



SUPERVISOR, ALIEN' 
RELATIONS BUREAU 
Space Sector 16 

And the 'line beneath that: 

Department of Galactic 
Investigation (Justice) 

EARLY afternoon sunlight 
slanted through a window and 
fell across his head, highlighting 
the clipped silver mustache, the 
whitening temple hair. 
Five men had died. . . . 
He wished that he could get it 
out of his mind. There was other 
work. This Sutton thing, for instance. The reports on that would 
be coming in within an hour or so. 

But there was a photograph . . . 
a photograph from Thorne, that he 
could not forget. v 

A smashed machine and broken 
bodies and a great smoking gash, 
sliced across the turf. The silver 
river flowed in a silence that one 
knew was there even in the photograph, and far in the distance the 
spidery web of Andrelon rose 
against a pinkish sky. 

Adams smiled softly to himself. 
Aldebaran XII, he thought, must be 
a lovely world. He never had been 
there and he never would be there 
... for there were too many planets 
for one man to even dream of seeing 
all. 

Someday, perhaps, when the teleports would transmit matter instantly across light years instead of puny 



TIME QUARRY 



miles . . . perhaps then a man might 
just whisk across to any planet that 
he wished, for a day or hour, or. 
just to say he'd been there. 

But Adams didn't need to be 
there. He had eyes' and ears there, 
as he had on every occupied planet 
within the entire galactic sector. 

Thome was there, and Thome 
was an able man. He wouldn't rest 
until he'd wrung the last ounce of 
information from the broken wreck 
and bodies. 

I wish I could forget it, Adams 
told himself. It's important, yes, but 
not all-important. 

A buzzer hummed at Adams and 
he flipped up a tumbler on his desk. 
"What is it?" 

A female android voice answered: "It's Mr. Thome, sir, on 
the mentophone from Andrelon." 

"Thank you, Alice," Adams said. 

He clicked open a drawer and 
took out the mentophone cap, "placed 
it on his head, adjusted it with 
steady fingers. Thoughts flickered 
through his brain, disjointed, random thought, enormously amplified 
by the Electro-Neuron Boosting Stations. Ghost thoughts drifting 
t'irough the universe — residual flotsam from the minds of men and 
creatures back to the unguessable 
past. 

Adams flinched. I'll never get 
used to it, he told himself. I will 
always duck, like the kid who anticipates a cuffing. 

The ghost thoughts peeped and 
cluttered at him. 



Adams closed his eyes and settled 
back. "Hello, Thorne," he thought. 

Thome's thought came in, thinned 
and tenuous over the distance of 
more than fifty light years. 

"That you, Adams?" 

"Yes, it's me. What's up?" 

A high, sing-song thought came 
in and skipped along his brain: 
Spill the rattle . . . pinch the fish 
. . . oxygen is high-priced. 

Adams forced the unwanted 
thought out of his brain, built up his concentration. "Start over again, 
Thorne. A ghost thought came along 
and blotted you out." 

Thome's thought was louder now, 
more distinct. ','1 wanted to ask you 
about a name. Seems to me I heard 
it once before, but I can't be sure." 

"What name?" 

Thorne was spacing his thoughts 
now, placing them slowly and with 
emphasis to cut through the static. 
"The name is Asher Sutton." • 

ADAMS sat bolt upright in his 
chair. His mouth flapped open. 
"What?" he roared. 

"Walk west," said a voice in his 
brain. "Walk west and then straight 
up." 

Thome's thought came in. . . . "it 
was the name that was on the fly 
leaf. . . ." 

"Start over," Adams concentrated. 
"Start over and take it slow. I 
couldn't hear a thing you thougjit." 

Thome's thoughts came slowly, 
intense mental power behind each 
word: 'lit was like this. You remem

ber that wreck we had out here? 
Five men killed. . . ." 

"Yes, yes. Of course I remember 
it." 

"Well, we found a book, or what 
once had been a book, on one >of 
the corpses. The book was burned, 
scorched through and through by 
radiation. The robots did what they 
could with it, but that wasn't much. 
A word here and there. Nothing 
you could make any sense out 
of " 

The thought static purred and 
rumbled. Half thoughts cut through. 
Rambling thought-snatches that had 
no human sense or meaning — that 
could have had no human sense or 
meaning even if they had been heard 
in their entirety. 

"Start over," Adams thought desperately. "Start over." 

"You know about this wreck. Five 
men. . . ." 

"Yes, yes. I got that much. Up 
to the part about the book. Where 
does Sutton come in?" 

"That was about all the robotics 
could figure out," Thorne told him. 
"Just three words. 'By Asher Sutton.' Like he might have been the 
author. Like the book might have 
been written by him. It was on one 
of the first pages. The title page, 
maybe. Such and such a book by 
Asher Sutton." 

There was silence. Even the ghost 
voices were still for a moment. Then 
a piping, lisping thought came in 
... a baby thought, immature and 
puling. And the thought was with


out context, untranslatable, almost 
meaningless ... but hideous and 
nerve-wrenching in its alien imbecility. 

Adams felt' the sudden chill of 
fear slice into his marrow. He 
grasped the chair arms with both hi's 
hands and hung on tight while the 
degraded mindlessness ' babbled in 
his brain. 

SUDDENLY the thought was 
gone. Fifty light years of space 
whistled in the cold. 

Adams relaxed, felt the perspiration running from his armpits, trickling down his ribs. "You there, 
Thorne?" he asked. 

"Yes. I caught some of that one, 
too." 

"Pretty bad, wasn't it?" 

"I've never heard much worse," 
Thorne told him. There was a moment's silence. Then Thome's 
thoughts took up again. "Maybe I'm 
just wasting time. But it seemed to 
me I remembered that name." 

"You have," Adams thought 
back. "Sutton went to 61 Cygni." 

"Oh, he's the one!" 

"He got back this morning." 

"Couldn't have been him, then. 
Someone else by the same name." 

"Must have been," thought 
Adams. 

"Nothing else to report," Thorne 
told him. "The name just bothered 
me." 

"Keep at it," Adams thought. 
"Let me know anything that turns 
up.


TIME QUARRY

"I will," Thome promised. 
"Good-bye." 

"Thanks for calling." 

ADAMS lifted off the mentophone cap. He opened his eyes 
and the sight of the room, commonplace and Earthly, with the sun 
streaming through the window, was 
almost a physical shock. 

He sat limp in his chair, thinking, 
remembering. 

The man had come at twilight, 
stepping out of the shadows onto 
the patio, and he had sat down in 
the darkness and talked like any 
other man. Except the things he 
said. 

When he returns, Sutton must be 
killed. I am your successor. 
■ Crazy talk. Unbelievable. Impossible. 

And, still, maybe I should have 
listened. Maybe I should have heard 
him out instead of flying off the 
handle. 

Except thaj you don't kill a man 
who comes back after twenty years. 

Especially a man like Sutton. 

Sutton is a good man. One of the 
best the Bureau has. Slick as a 
whistle, well grounded in alien psychology, an authority on galactic 
politics. No other man could have 
done the Cygnian job as well. 

If he did it. 

I don't know that, of course. But 
he'll be in tomorrow and he'll tell 
me all about it. 

A man is entitled to a day's rest 
after twenty years. 



Slowly, Adams reached out an 
almost reluctant hand and snapped 
up a tumbler. 

Alice answered. 

"Send me in the Asher Sutton 
file." 

"Yes, Mr. Adams." 

Adams settled back in his chair. 

The warmth of the sun felt good 
across his shoulders. The ticking of 
the clock was comforting after the 
ghost voices whispering out in space. 
Thoughts that one could not pin 
down, that one could not trace back 
and say: "This one started here and 
then." - \ 

Although we're trying, Adams 
thought. He chuckled to himself at 
the weirdness of the project. , 

Thousands of listeners listening 
in on the random thoughts of random time and space, listening in for 
clues, for hints, for leads. Seeking 
a driblet of sense from the stream 
of gibberish . . . hunting the word 
or sentence or disassociated thought 
that might be translated into a new 
philosophy or a new technique or a 
new science ... or a new something 
that the human race had never even 
dreamed of. 

A new concept, said Adams, talking to himself. An entirely new concept. 

Adams scowled to himself. 

A new concept might be dangerous.. This was not the time for anything that did not fit into human 
society, that did not match the pattern of human thought and action. 

There must be no confusion. 



26 




 



There must be nothing but the sheer, 
bulldog determination to hang on, to 
sink in one's teeth and stay. To 
maintain the status quo. 

Later, someday, many centuries 
from now, there would be a time 
and place and room for a new concept. When Man's grip was firmer, 
when the line was not too thin, when 
a mistake or two would not spell 
disaster. 

Man, at the moment, controlled 
every factor. He held the edge at 
every point ... a slight edge, admitted, but certainly an edge. And 
it must stay that way. There must 
be nothing that would tip the scale 
in the wrong direction. Not a word 
or thought, not an action or a whisper. 

The desk buzzer lighted up and 
snarled at him. 

"Yes?" said Adams. 

Alice's words tumbled over one 
another. "The file, sir. The Sutton 
file." 

"What about the Sutton file? 
Bring it in here." 

"It's gone, sir." 

"Someone is using it."' 

"No, sir, not that. It has been 
stolen." 

Adams jerked straight upright. 
"Stolen!" 

"That is right, sir. Twenty years 
ago." 

"But twenty years. . 

"We checked the security points," 
said Alice. "It was stolen three days 
after Mr. Sutton set out for <Sl 
Cygni." . 



VII 

THE lawyer told Sutton his name 
was Wellington. He had painted 
a thin coat of plastic lacquer over his 
forehead to hide the tattoo, but the 
mark of the manufacture showed 
through, provided one looked closely. 

He laid his hat very carefully on 
a "table, sat down meticulously in a 
chair and placed his briefcase across 
his knee. He handed Sutton a rolledup paper. 

"Your newspaper,' sir," he said. 
"It was outside the door. I thought 
that you might want it." 
"Thanks," said Sutton. 
Wellington cleared his throat. 
"You are Asher Sutton?" he asked. 
Sutton nodded. 

"I represent a certain robot who 
commonly went by the name of 
Buster. You may remember him." 

Sutton leaned quickly forward. 
"Remember him? Why, he was a 
second father to me. Raised me after 
both my parents died. He has been 
with the Sutton family for almost 
four thousand years." 

Wellington cleared his throat 
again. "Quite so." 

Sutton leaned back in his chair, 
crushing the newspaper in his grip. 
"Don't tell me . . ." 

Wellington waved a sober hand. 
*'No, he's in no trouble. Not yet, 
that is. Not unless you choose to 
make it for him." 

"What has he done?" asked Sutton. 

"He has run away." 



TIME QUARRY 



27 



"Good Lord! Run away? Where 
to?" 

Wellington squirmed uneasily in 
the chair. "To one of the Tower 
stars, I believe." 

"But," protested Sutton, "that's 
way out. Out almost to the edge of 
the galaxy." 

Wellington nodded. "He bought 
himself a new body and a ship and 
stocked it up . . ." 

"With what? asked Sutton. "Buster had no money." 

"Oh, yes, he had. Money he had 
saved over — what was it you said ? — 
four thousand years or so. Tips from 
guests, Christmas presents, one thing 
and another. It would all count up 
... in four thouand years. (Placed at 
interest, you know." 

"But ■why?" asked Sutton. "What 
does he intend to do?" 

"He took out a homestead on a 



planet. He didn't sneak away. He 
filed his claim, so you can trace him 
if you wish. He used the family 
name, sir. That worried him a little. 
He hoped you wouldn't mind." 

Sutton shook his head. "Not at 
all. He has a right to that name, as 
good a right as I have myself." 

"You don't mind, then?" asked 
Wellington. "About the whole thing, 
I mean ? After all, he was your property." ■ 

"No," said Sutton, "I don't mind. 
But I was looking forward to seeing 
him again. I called the old home 
place, but there was no answer. I 
thought he might be out." 

Wellington reached into the inside 
pocket of his coat. "He left you a 
letter," he said, holding it out. 

Sutton took it. It had his name 
written across its face. He turned it 
over, but there was nothing more. 




28 




 



"He also," said Wellington, "left 
an old trunk in my custody. Said it 
contained some old family papers 
that you might find of interest." 

Sutton sat quietly staring across 
the room, seeing nothing. 

There had- been an apple tree at 
the gate, and each year young Ash 
Sutton had eaten the apples when 
they were green, and Buster had 
nursed him each time gently through 
the crisis and then had whaled him 
good and proper to teach him respect for his human metabolism. 
And when the kid down the road 
had licked him on the way home 
from school, it had been Buster who 
had taken him out in the backyard _ 
and taught him how to fight with 
head as well as hands. 

Sutton clenched his fists unconsciously, remembering the surge of 
satisfaction, the red rawness of his 
knuckles. The kid down the road, 
he recalled, had nursed a black eye 
for a 'week and become his fastest 
friend. 

"About the trunk, sir?" asked Wellington. "You will want it delivered?" 

"Yes," said Sutton, "if you 
please." 

"It will be here tomorrow morning." The android picked up his 
hat and rose. "I want to thank you, 
sir, for my client. He assured me 
you would be reasonable." 

"Not reasonable," said Sutton. 
"Just fair. He took care of us for 
many years. He has earned his freedom." 




"Good day, sir," said Wellington. 

"Good day," said Sutton. "And 
thank you very much." 

One of the mermaids whistled a f 
Sutton. Sutton told her. "One of 
these days, my beauty, you'll do that 
once too often." 

She thumbed her nose at him and 
dived into the fountain. 

The door clicked shut as Wellington left. 

Slowly, Sutton tore the letter open, 
spread out the single page: 

Dear Ash — / went to see Mf. 
Adams today and he told me 



TIME QUARRY 



that be was afraid that you 
would not come hack, but I told 
him that I knew you would. So 
I'm not doing this because I 
think you won't come back and 
that you will never know . . . 
because I know you will. Since 
you left me and struck out on 
your oivn, I have felt old and 
useless. In a galaxy where there 
were many things to do, I was 
doing nothing. You told me you 
just wanted me to live on at the 
old place and take it easy,, and 
I knew you did that because you 
were kind and would not sell 
me even if you had no use for 
me. So I'm doing something I 
have always wanted to do. I am 
filing on a planet. It sounds 
like a pretty good planet and 
I should be able to do something with it. I shall fix it up 
and build a home and maybe 
someday you will come and yisit 
me. 

P. S. If you ever want me, 
you can find out where I am 
at the homestead office. 

GENTLY, Sutton folded the sheet, 
put it in his pocket. 
He sat idly in the chair, listening 
to the purling of the stream that 
gushed through the painting hung 
above the fireplace. A bird sang and 
a fish jumped in a quiet pool around 
the bend, just outside the frame. 

Tomorrow, he thought, I will see 
Adams. Maybe I can find out if he's 
behind what happened. Although 



why should he be? I'm working for 
•him. I'm carrying out his orders. 

He shook his head. No, it couldn't 
be Adams. 

But it must be someone. Someone 
who had been laying for him, who 
even now was watching. 

He shrugged mental shoulders, 
picked up the newspaper and opened 
it. 

It was the Galactic Press and in 
twenty years its format had not 
changed. Conservative columns of 
gray type ran down the page, broken 
only by laconic headings. Earth news 
started in the upper left-hand corner 
of the front page, followed by Martian news, by Venusian news, by the 
column from the asteroids, the column and a half from the Jovian 
moons . . . then the outer planets. 
News from the rest of the galaxy, 
he knew, could be found on the inside pages. A paragraph or two to 
each story. Like the old community 
personal columns in the country 
papers of many centuries before. 

Still, thought Sutton, smoothing 
out the paper, it was the only way it 
could be handled. There was so much 
news . . . news from many worlds, 
from many sectors . . . human news, 
android and robot news, alien news. 
The items had to be boiled down, 
condensed, compressed, making one 
word do the job of a hundred. 

There were other papers, of 
course, serving isolated sections, and 
these would give the local news in 
more detail. But on Earth there was 
need of galactic-wide news coverage 



30 




 



... for Earth was the capital of the 
galaxy, a planet that was nothing but 
a capital, a planet that grew no food, 
allowed no industries, that made its 
business nothing but government. A 
planet whose every inch was landscaped and tended like a lawn or 
park or garden. 

Sutton ran his eye down the Earth 
column. An earthquake in eastern 
Asia. A new underwater development 
for the housing of alien employes 
and representatives from watery 
worlds. Delivery of three new star 
ships to the Sector 19 run. And 
then: 

Asher Sutton, special agent 
of the department of galactic 
investigation, returned today 
from 61 Cygni, to which he was 
assigned twenty years ago. Hope 
of his return had been abandoned. Immediately upon his 
landing, a guard -was thrown 
around his ship and he <was in 
seclusion at the Orion Arms. All 
attempts to reach him for a statement failed. Shortly after his arrival, he was called out by Geoffrey Benton. Mr. Sutton chose 
a pistol and informality. 

Sutton read the item again. All 
attempts to reach him . . . 

Herkimer had said there were reporters and photographers in the 
lobby, and ten minutes later Ferdinand had sworn there weren't. He had 
had no calls. There had been no attempt to reach him. Or had there? 



Attempts that had been neatly 
stopped. Stopped by the same person 
who had lain in wait for him, the 
same power that had been inside the 
room when he stepped across the 
threshold. 

He dropped the paper to the floor, 
sat thinking. 

He had been drugged and 
searched, an attempt made to probe 
his mind. His attache case had been 
ransacked. He had been challenged 
by one of Earth's foremost duelists. 
The old family robot had run away 
... or been persuaded to run away. 
Attempts by the press to reach him 
had been stopped cold. 

The visor purred at him. 

A call. The first since he had 
arrived. 

HE SWUNG around in his chaif 
and flipped up the switch. 
A woman's face came in. Granite 
eyes and skin magnolia white, hair 
a copper glory. 

"My name is Eva Armour," she 
said. "I am the one who asked you 
to hold the elevator." 

"I recognized you," said Sutton. 
"I called to make amends." 
"There is no need . . ." 
"But there is, Mr. Sutton. You 
thought I was laughing at you and 
I really wasn't." 

"I looked funny," Sutton told her. 
"It was your privilege to laugh." 

"Will you take me out to dinner?" 
she asked. 

"Certainly," gasped Sutton. "I 
would be delighted to." 



TIME QUARRY

"And someplace afterward," she 
suggested. "We'll make an evening 
of it." 

"Gladly." 

"I'll meet you in the lobby at 
seven," she said. "And I won't be 
late." 

The visor faded and Sutton sat 
stiffly in the chair. 

We'll make an evening of it, he 
said, talking to himself, and you'll 
be lucky if you're alive tomorrow. 

VIII 

s 

ADAMS silently faced the four 
men who had come into his 
office, trying to make out what they 
might be thinking. But their faces 
gave no indication. 

Clark, the space construction engineer, clutched a field book in his 
hand and his face was set and stern. 
There was no foolishness about 
Clark . . . ever. 

Anderson, anatomist, big and 
rough, was lighting his pipe and, 
for the moment, that seemed to him 
the most important thing in all the 
worlds. 

Blackburn, the psychologist, 
frowned at the glowing tip of his 
cigarette, and Shulcross, the language 
expert, sprawled sloppily in his chair 
like a bored youngster. 

They found something, 'Adams 
told himself. They found plenty and 
some of it has them tangled up. 

"Clark," said Adams, "suppose 
you start us out." 

"We looked the ship over," Clark 



told him, "and we found it couldn't 
fly." 

"But it did," said Adams. "Sutton 
brought it home." 

Clark shrugged, "He might aspwell 
have used a log. Or a hunk of rock. 
Either one would have served the 
purpose. Either one would fly just 
as well, or better, than that heap of 
junk." 

"Junk?" 

"The engines were washed out," 
said Clark. "The safety automatics 
were the only things that kept them 
from atomizing. The ports were 
cracked, some of them were broken. 
One of the tubes was busted off and 
lost. The whole ship was twisted out 
of line." 

"That sounds like a wreck," 
Adams objected. 

"It had struck something." Clark 
declared. "Struck it hard and fast. 
Seams were opened, the structural 
plates were bent, the whole thing 
was twisted out of kilter. Even if you 
could start the engines, the ship 
would never handle. Even with the 
tubes okay you couldn't set a course. 
Give it any drive and it would simply 
corkscrew." 

Anderson cleared his throat. 
"What would hare happened to 
Sutton if he'd been in it when it 
it was struck?" 

"He would have died," said Clark. 

"You are positive of that?" 

"No question. Even a miracle 
wouldn't have saved him. We 
thought of that, so we worked it 
out. We rigged up a diagram and we 



32 




 



used the most conservative force factors to show theoretic effects . . ." 

Adams interrupted. "But he must 
have been in the ship." 

Clark shook his head stubbornly. 
"If he was, he died. Our diagram 
shows he didn't have a chance. If 
one force didn't kill him, a dozen 
others would." 

"Sutton came back," Adams said. 




IHE two stared at one another, 
half angrily. 



Anderson broke the silence. "Had 
he tried to fix it up?" 

Clark shook his head. "Not a 
mark to show he did. There would 
have been no use trying. Sutton didn't know a thing about mechanics. 
Not a single thing. I checked on that. 
He had no training, no natural inclination. And it takes a man with 
savvy to repair an atomic engine. 
Just to fix it, not rebuild it. And 
this crash would have called for 
complete rebuilding." 

Shulcross spoke for the first time, 
softly, quietly, not moving from his 
awkward slouch. "Maybe we're 
starting in the middle. If we started 
at the beginning, laid the groundwork first, we might get a better 
idea of what really happened." 

They looked at him, all of them, 
wondering what he meant. Shulcross saw it was up to him to go 
ahead. He spoke to Adams: "Do you 
have any idea of what sort of place 
this Cygnian world might be where 
Sutton went?" 

Adams smiled wearily. "We've 



never been able to get close enough 
to know. It's the seventh planet of 
61 Cygni. It might have been any 
one of the system's sixteen planets, 
but mathematically it was figured out 
that the seventh planet had the best 
chance of sustaining life."
He paused and looked around 
the circle of faces and saw that they 
were waiting for him to go on. 

"Sixty-one," he said, "is a near 
neighbor of ours. It was one of the 
first suns that Man headed for when 
he left the solar system. Ever since 
it has been a thorn in our sides." 

Anderson grinned. "Because we 
couldn't crack it." 

Adams nodded. "That's right. A 
secret system in a galaxy that held 
few secrets from Man anytime he 
wanted to go out and take the trouble 
to solve them. We've run into all 
sorts of weird things, of course. Planetary conditions that, to this day, we 
haven't licked. Weird, dangerous 
life. Economic systems and psychological concepts that had us floored 
and still give us a headache every 
time we think of them. But we were 
always able, at the very least, to see 
the thing that gave us trouble, to 
know the thing that licked us. With 
Cygni it was different. We couldn't 
even get there. 

"The planets are either cloudcovered or screenad, for we've never 
seen the surface of a single one of 
them. And when you get within a 
few billion miles of the system you 
start sliding." He turned to Clark. 
"That's the right word, isn't it?" 



. / 

TIME QUARRY 



33 



"There's no word for it," Clark 
"told him, "but sliding comes as close 
as any. You aren't stopped and you 
aren't slowed, but you are deflected. 
As if the ship had hit ice, although 
it feels slicker than ice. Whatever, it 
is, it doesn't register. There's no 
sign of it, nothing that you can see, 
nothing that makes even the faintest 
flicker on the instruments, but you 
hit it and you slide off course. You 
correct and you slide off course again. 
, In the early days, it drove men batty 
trying to reach the system and never 
getting a mile nearer than a certain 
imaginary line." 

"As if," said Adams, "someone 
had taken his finger and drawn a 
deadline around the system." 

"Something like that," said Clark. 

"But Sutton ' got through," said 
Anderson. 

"I don't like it," Clark declared. 
"I don't like a thing about it. Someone got a brainstorm. Our ships are 
too big, they said. If we use smaller 
ships, we might squeeze through. As 
if the thing that kept us off was a 
mesh holding back the big jobs." 

"Sutton got through," said Adams 
stubbornly. "They launched him in 
a lifeboat and he got through where 
the big ships couldn't." 

CLARK shook his head, just as 
stubbornly. "It doesn't make 
sense. Smallness and bigness wouldn't 
have a thing to do with it. There's 
another factor somewhere, a factor 
we've never even thought of. Sutton 
got through, all right, and he crashed 



and if he was in the ship when it 
crashed, he died. But he didn't get 
through only because his ship was 
small. It was for some other reason." 

The men sat tense, thinking, waiting. 

"Why Sutton?" Anderson asked, 
finally. 

Adams answered quietly. "The 
ship was small. We could only send 
one man. We picked the man we • 
thought could do the best job if he 
did get through." 

"And Sutton was the best man?" 

"He was," said Adams. 

Anderson said amiably: "Well, 
apparently he was. He got through." 

"Or was let through," said Blackburn. 

"Not necessarily," said Anderson. 

"It follows," Blackburn contended. 
"Why did we want to get into the 
Cygnian system? To find out if it 
was dangerous. That was the idea, 
wasn't it?" 

"That was the idea," Adams 
agreed. "Anything unknown is potentially dangerous. You can't write 
it off until you are sure. Those were 
Sutton's instructions: Find out if 61 
is dangerous." 

"And, by the same token, they'd 
want to find out about us," Blackburn 
said. "We'd been prying and poking 
at them for several thousand years. 
They might have wanted to find out 
about us as badly as we did about 
them." 

Anderson nodded. "I see what 
you mean. They'd chance one man, 
if they could haul him in, but they 



34 




 



wouldn't let a full-armed ship and 
a fighting crew get in shooting distance." 

"Exactly," said Blackburn. 

Adams dismissed the line of talk 
abruptly, said to Clark: "You spoke 
of dents. Were they made recently?" 

"Twenty years ago looks right to 
me. There was a lot of rust. Some 
of the wiring was getting pretty 
soft." 

"Let us suppose, then," said Anderson, "that Sutton, by some miracle, had the knowledge to fix the 
ship. Even so, he would have needed 
materials." 

' "Plenty of them," said Clark. 

"The Cygnians could have supplied them," Shulcross suggested. 

' "If there are any Cygnians," said 
Anderson. 

"I don't believe they could," 
Blackburn declared. "A race that 
hides behind a screen would not be 
mechanical. If they knew mechanics, they would go .out into space 
instead of shielding themselves from 
space. I'll make a guess the Cygnians 
are non-mechanical." 

"But the screen," Anderson , 
prompted. 

"It wouldn't have to be mechanical," Blackburn said flatly. "Some 
energy force or other we don't know 
about." 

Clark smacked his open palm on 
his knee. "What's the use of all this 
speculation? Sutton didn't repair 
that ship. He brought it back, somehow, without repair. He didn't even 
try to fix it. There are layers of rust 



on everything and there's not a 
wrench mark on it." 

Shulcross leaned forward. "One 
thing I don't get: Clark says some ' 
of the ports were broken. That 
means Sutton navigated eleven light 
years without air to breathe." 

"He used a suit," said Blackburn. 

Clark said quietly: "There weren't 
any suits." He looked around the 
room, almost as if he feared some 
one outside the little circle might 
be listening. "And that isn't all. 
There wasn't any food and there 
wasn't any water." 

Anderson tapped out his pipe 
against the palm of his hand and 
the hollow sound of tapping echoed 
in the room. Carefully, deliberately, 
almost as if he forced himself to 
concentrate upon it, he dropped the 
ash from his hand into a tray. 

"I might have the answer to that 
one," he said. "At least a clue. There 
is still a lot of work to do before 
we have the answer. And, then, we can't be sure." He was aware of the 
eyes upon him. "I hesitate to say the 
thing I have in mind." 

NO ONE spoke a word. 
The clock on the wall ticked 
the seconds off. 

From far outside the open window, a locust hummed in the quiet 
of afternoon. 

"I don't think," said Anderson, 
"that the man is human." 

The clock ticked on. The locust 
shrilled to tense silence. 

Adams finally spoke. "But the 



TIME QUARRY 



35 



fingerprints checked. The eyeprints, 
too." 

"Oh, it's Sutton, all right," Anderson admitted. "There is no doubt 
of that. Sutton on the outside. Sutton in the flesh. The same body, or 
at least part of the same body, that 
left Earth twenty years ago." 

"What are you getting at?" asked 
Clark. "If he's the same, he's human." 

"You take an old spaceship," said 
Anderson, "and you juice it up. Add 
a gadget here and another there, 
eliminate one thing, modify another. 
What have you got?" 

"A rebuilt job," said Clark. 

"That's just the phrase I wanted," 
Anderson told them. "Someone or 
something has done the same to 
Sutton. He's a rebuilt job. And the 
best human job I have ever seen. 
He's got two hearts and his nervous 
system's haywire . . . well, not haywire exactly, but different. Certainly 
• not human. And he's got an extra 
circulatory system. Not a circulatory 
system, either, but that is what it 
•looks like. Only it's not connected 
with the heart. Right now, I'd say, 
it's not being used. Like a spare 
system. One system starts running 
down and you can switch to the 
spare one while you tinker with the 
first." 

ANDERSON pocketed his pipe, 
rubbed his hands together almost as if he were washing them. 

"Well, there," he said, "you have 
it." 



Blackburn blurted out: "It sounds 
impossible." 

Anderson appeared not to have 
heard him, and yet answered him. 
"We had Sutton under for the best 
part of an hour and we put every 
inch of him on tape and film. It 
takes some time to analyze a job 
like that. We aren't finished yet. 
But we failed in one thing. We used 
a psychonometer on his mind and 
we didn't get a nibble. Not a quaver, 
not a thought. Not even mental 
seepage. His mind was closed, tight 
shut." 

"Some defect in the meter," 
Adams suggested. 

"No," said Anderson. "We 
checked that." He looked around the 
room, from one face to another. 
"Maybe you don't realize the implication. When a man is drugged 
or asleep ... or in any case where 
he is unaware, a psychonometer will 
turn him inside out. It will dig out 
things that his waking self would 
swear he didn't know. Even when a 
man fights against it, there is a certain seepage and that seepage 
widens as his mental resistance wears 
down." 

"But it didn.'t work with Sutton," 
Shulcross said. 

"That's right. It didn't work with 
Sutton. I tell you, the man's not human." 

"And you think he's different 
enough, physically, so that he could 
live in space without air, food and 
water?" 

"I don't know," said Anderson.

He licked hi% lips and stared around 
the room. "I don't know. I simply 
don't." 

Adams spoke softly. "We must 
not ■ get upset. Alienness is no 
strange thing to us, Once it might 
have been, when the first humans 
went out into space. But today. . . ." 

Clark interrupted impatiently. 
"Alien things themselves don't 
bother me. But when a man turns 
alien. . . ." He gulped, appealed to 
Anderson. "Do you think he's dangerous?" 

"Possibly," said Anderson. 

"Even if he is, he can't do much 
to harm us," Adams told them calmly. "That place of his is simply 
clogged with spy rigs." 

"Any reports in yet?" asked 
Blackburn. 

"Just general. Nothing specific. 
Sutton has been taking it easy. Had 
a few calls. Made a few himself. 
Had a visitor or two." 

"He knows he's being watched," 
said Clark. "He's putting on an 
act." 

"There's a rumor around," said 
Blackburn, "that Benton challenged 
him." 

Adams nodded. "Yes, he did. Ash 
tried to back out of it. That doesn't 
sound as if he's dangerous." 

"Maybe," speculated Clark, almost 
hopefully, "Benton will close our 
case for us." 

Adams smiled thinly. "Somehow 
I think Ash may have spent the afternoon thinking up a dirty deal for 
our Mr. Benton." 



Anderson had fished the pipe out 
of his pocket, was loading it from 
his pouch. Clark was fumbling for 
a cigarette. 




DAMS looked at Shulcross. 
. "You have something?" 



The language expert nodded. 
"But it's not too exciting. We 
opened Sutton's case and we found 
a manuscript. We photostated it and 
replaced it exactly as it was. But so 
far it hasn't done us any good. We 
can't read a word of it." 

"Code," said Blackburn. 

Shulcross shook his head. "If it 
was code, our robots would have 
cracked it in an hour or two. But 
it's not a code. It's language. And 
until you get a key, a language can't 
be cracked." 

"You've checked, of course." 

Shulcross smiled glumly. "Back 
to the old Earth languages . . . back 
to Babylon and Crete. We crosschecked every lingo in the galaxy. 
None of them came close." 

"Language," said Blackburn. "A 
new language. That means Sutton 
found something." 

"Sutton would," said Adams. 
"He's the best agent I ever had." 

Anderson stirred restlessly in his 
chair. "You like Sutton?" he asked. 

"I do," said Adams. 

"Adams," said Anderson, "I've 
been wondering. It's i thing that , 
struck me funny from the first." 

"Yes, what is it?" 

"You knew Sutton was coming 
back. Knew almost to the minute 



TIME QUARRY 



37 



when he would arrive. And you set 
3 mousetrap for him. How come?" 

"Just a hunch," said Adams. 

For a long moment all four of 
them sat looking at him. Then they 
saw he meant to say no more. They 
rose and left the room. / 

IX 

ACROSS the room a woman's 
laughter floated, sharp-edged 
with excitement. 

The lights changed from the duskblue of April to the purple-gray of 
madness, and the room was another 
world that floated in a hush that 
was not exactly silence. Perfume 
came down a breeze that touched 
the cheek with ice . . . perfume that 
called to mind black orchids in an 
outland of breathless terror. 

The floor swayed beneath Sutton's 
feet and he felt Eva's- small fist digging hard into his arm. 

The Zag spoke to them — an android with specialized psychic development — and his words were dead 
and hollow sounds dripping from 
a mummied husk. "What is it that 
you wish? Here you live the lives 
you yearn for . . . find any escape 
that, you may seek . . . possess the 
things you dream of." 

"There was a stream," said Sutton. "A little creek that ran. . . ." 

The light changed to green, a 
faery green that glowed with soft, 
quiet life, exuberant, springtime life 
and the hint of things to come, and 
there were trees, trees that were 



fringed and haloed with the glistening, sun-kissed green of first-bursting buds. 

Sutton wiggled his toes and knew 
the grass beneath them, the first 
tender grass of spring, and smelled 
the hepatieas and bloodroot that had 
almost no smell at all . . . and the 
stronger scent of sweet "Williams 
blooming on the hill across the 
creek. 

He told himself: "It's too early 
for sweet Williams to be in bloom." 

The creek gurgled at him as it 
ran across the shingle down into the 
Big Hole, and he hurried forward 
across the meadow grass, cane pole 
tight-clutched in one hand, the can 
of worms in the other. 

A bluebird flashed through the 
trees that climbed the bluff across 
the meadow and a robin sang high 
in the top of the mighty elm that 
grew above the Big Hole. 

Sutton found the worn place in 
the bank, like a chair with the elm's 
trunk serving as a back, and he sat 
down in it and leaned forward to 
peer into the water. The current ran 
strong and dark and deep. 

Sutton drew in his breath and 
held it with pent-up anticipation. 
With shaking hands he found the 
biggest worm and pulled it from the 
can, baited up the hook. 

Breathlessly, he dropped the hook 
into the water, canted the pole in 
front of him for easy handling. The 
bobber drifted down the swirling 
slide of water, floated' in an eddy 
where the current turned back upon 



38 




 



itself. It jerked, almost disappeared, 
then bobbed to the surface and 
floated once again. 

Sutton leaned forward, arms aching with tension. But even through 
the tension, he knew the goodness 
of the day. The water talked to him 
and he felt himself grow and become a being that comprehended 
and became a part of the clean, white 
ecstasy that was the hills and stream 
and meadow . . . earth, cloud, water, 
sky and sun. 

And the bobber went clear under! 

He felt the weight and strength of 
the fish that he had caught. It sailed 
in an arc above his head and landed 
in the grass behind him. He laid 
down his pole, scrambled to his feet 
and ran. 

The chub flopped in the grass and 
he grabbed the line and held it up. 
It was a whopper ! Sobbing in excitement, he dropped to his knees and 
grasped the fish,, removed the hook 
with fingers that fumbled in their 
trembling. 

"Hello," said a childish voice. 

Sutton twisted around, still on his 
knees. 

A LITTLE girl stood by the elm 
tree, and it seemed for a 
moment that he had seen her somewhere before. But then he realized 
that she was a stranger and he 
frowned a little, for girls were no 
good when it came to fishing. He 
hoped she wouldn't stay. It would be 
just like a girl to hang around and 
spoil the day for him. 



. "I am . . . ," she said, speaking a 
name he did not catch, for she lisped 
a little. 

He did not answer. 

"I am eight years old," she said. 

"I am Asher Sutton," he told 
her, "and I am ten . . . going on 
eleven." 

She stood and stared at him, one 
hand plucking nervously at the figured apron that she wore. The apron, 
he noticed, was clean and starched, 
very stiff and prim, and she was messing it all up with her nervous plucking. 

"I am fishing," he said and tried 
very hard to keep from sounding too 
important. "And I just caught a 
whopper." 

He saw her eyes go large in sudden terror at the sight of something 
that came up from behind him and 
he wheeled around, no longer on his 
knees, but on his feet, and his hand 
was snaking into the pocket of his 
coat. 

The place was purple-gray and 
there was shrill woman-laughter and 
there was a face in front of him . . . 
a face he had seen that afternoon 
and never would forget. 

A fat and cultured face that 
twinkled even now with good fellowship, twinkled despite the deadly 
squint, and the gun already swinging upward in his hairy, pudgy fist. 

Sutton felt his own fingers touch 
the grip on the gun he carried, felt 
them tighten around it and jerk it 
from the pocket. But he was too late, 
he knew, to beat the spat of flame 



TIME QUARRY 



39 



from a gun that had long seconds 
start. 

Anger flamed within him, cold, 
desolate, deadly anger. Anger at the 
pudgy fist, at the smiling face . . . 
the face that would smile across a 
chess board or from behind a gun. 
The smile of an egotist who would 
try to beat a robotic that was designed to play a perfect game of 



chess ... an egotist who believed 
that he could shoot down Asher Sutton. 

THE anger, he realized, was something more than anger . . . 
something greater and more devastating than the mere working of 
human adrenal. It was a part of him 
and something that was more than 





him, more than the mortal thing of 
flesh and blood that was Asher Sutton. A terrible thing . plucked from 
non-humanity. 

The face before him melted ... or 
it seemed to melt. It changed and the 
smile was gone, and Sutton felt the 
anger whip from his brain and slam 
bullet-hard against the wilting personality that was Geoffrey Benton. 

Benton's gun coughed loudly and. 
the muzzle-flash was blood red in the 
purple light. Then Sutton felt the 
thud of his own gun slamming back 
against the heel of his hand as he 
pulled the trigger. 

Benton was falling, twisting forward, bending at the middle as if he 
had hinges in his stomach, and Sutton caught one glimpse of the purpletinted face before it dropped to the 
floor. There were surprise and 
anguish and a terrible over-riding 
fear printed on the features that had 
been twisted out of shape. 

The crashing of the guns had 
smashed the place to silence, and 
through the garish light that swirled 
with powder smoke, Sutton saw the 
white blobs of many faces staring at 
him. Faces that mostly were without 
expression, although some of them 
had mouths and the mouths were 
round and open. 

He felt a tugging at his elbow and 
he moved, guided by the hand upon 
his arm. Suddenly he was limp and 
shaken and the anger was no more 
and he told himself: "I have just 
killed a man." 

"Quick," said Eva Armour's voice. 



TIME QUARRY 



"We must get out of here. They'll 
be swarming at you now. The whole 
hell^s pack of them." 

"*It was you," he told her. "I remember now. I didn't catch the name 
at first. You mumbled it ... or I 
guess you lisped, and I didn't hear 
it.'" 

The girl tugged at his arm. "They 
had Benton- conditioned to kill you. 
They figured that was all they needed. They never dreamed you could 
match him in a duel." 

"You were the little girl," Sutton 
told her blankly. "You wore a checkered apron and you kept twisting it 
nervously." 

"What 'in heaven's name are you 
talking about?" 

"I was fishing," Benton said, "and 
I had just caught a big one when you 
came along . . ." 

"You're crazy," said the girl. 
"Fishing? Here?" 

She pushed open a door and pulled 
him out and the cool air of night 
' slapped him briskly and shockingly 
across the face. 

"Wait a second," he cried. He 
wheeled around and caught the girl's 
arms roughly in his hands. "They?" 
he yelled at her. "What are you talking about? Who are they . . ." 

She stared at him wide-eyed. "You 
mean you don't know?" 

He shook his head, bewildered. 

"Poor Ash," she said. 

Her copper hair was a reddish 
flame, burnished and alive in the 
flicker of the sign that flashed on 
and off above the Zag House facade: 



DREAMS TO ORDER 
Live the Life You Missed! 
Dream Up a Tough One for Us! 

AN android doorman spoke to 
them softly. "You wished a cab, 
sir?" Even as he spoke, the car was 
there, sliding smoothly and silently 
up the driveway, like a black beetle 
winging from the night. The doorman reached out a hand and swung 
wide the door. "Quick is the word," 
he said. 

There was something in the soft, 
slurred tone that made Sutton move. 
He stepped inside the car and pulled 
Eva after him. The android slammed 
the door. 

Sutton tramped on the accelerator 
and the car screamed down the curving driveway, slid into the highway, 
roared with leashed impatience as it 
took the long road curving toward 
the hills. 

"Where?" asked Sutton. 

"Back to the Arms," she said. 
"They wouldn't dare to try for you 
there. Your room is rigged with 
rays." 

Sutton chuckled. "I have to be 
careful or I would trip on them. But 
how come you know?" 

"It is my job to know." 

"Friend or foe?" he asked. 

"Friend," she said. 

He turned his head and studied 
her. She had slumped down in the 
seat and was a little girl again . . . 
but she didn't have a checkered apron 
and she wasn't nervous. 

"I don't suppose," said Sutton, 



42 




 



"that it would be any use for me to 
ask you questions?" 

She shook her head. 

"If I did, you'd probably lie to 
me." 

"If I wanted to," she said. 

"I could shake it out of you." 

"You could, but you won't. You 
see, Ash, I know you very well." 

"You just met me yesterday." 

"Yes, I know," she said, "but I've 
studied you for all of twenty years." 

X 

THE trunk came in the morning 
when Sutton was finishing his 
breakfast. 

It was old and battered, the ancient rawhide covering hanging in 
tatters to reveal the marred steel 
skeleton, flecked here and there with 
rust. A key was in the lock and the 
straps were broken. Mice had gnawed 
the leather completely off one end. 

Sutton remembered it. It was the 
one that had stood in the far corner 
of the attic when he had been a boy 
and gone there to play on rainy afternoons. . 

He picked up the neatly folded 
copy of the morning edition of the 
Galactic Press that had come with his 
breakfast tray and shook it out. 

The article he was looking for was 
on the front page, the third item in 
the Earth news column: 

Mr. Geoffrey Benton was 
killed last night in an informal 
meeting at one of the amuse


ment centers in the university 
district. The victor ' was Mr. 
Asher Sutton, who returned 
only yesterday from a mission to 
61 Cygni. 

There was a final sentence, the 
most damning that could be written 
of .a duelist: 

Mr. Benton fired first and 
missed. 

Sutton folded the paper again and 
laid it carefully on the table. He lit 
a cigarette. 

I thought it would be me, he told 
himself. I never fired a gun like that 
before . . . scarcely knew such a gun 
existed. Of course, I didn't really 
kill Benton. He killed himself. If he 
hadn't missed . . . and there was no 
excuse for missing ... the item 
would have read the other way 
around. 

We'll make an evening of it, the 
girl had said, and she probably 
knew. We'll have dinner and make 
an evening of it and Geoffrey Benton will kill you by appointment at 
the Zag House. 

YES, said Sutton to himself, she 
might have known. She knows 
too many things. About the spy traps 
in this room, for instance. And about 
someone who had Benton psychologically conditioned to challenge me 
and kill me. 

She said friend when I asked her 
friend or foe, but a word is an easy 



TIME QUARRY 



43 



thing. There is no way to know if it 
is true or false. 

She said she had studied me for 
twenty years and that is false, of 
course, for twenty years ago I was 
setting out for Cygni and I was unimportant. Just a cog in a great 
machine. I am unimportant still, 
unimportant to everyone but myself, 
and to a great idea that no human 
but myself could possible know 
about. For no matter if the manuscript was photostated; there is not a 
soul can read it. 

He snubbed out the cigarette and 
rose and walked over to the trunk. 
The lock was rusty . and the key 
turned hard, but he finally got it 
open and lifted up the lid. 

The trunk was half full of papers 
neatly piled. Sutton, looking at them, 
chuckled. Buster always was a methodical soul. But, then, all robots 
were methodical. It was the nature of 
them. Methodical and — what was it 
Herkimer had said? — stubborn. 

He squatted on the floor beside 
the trunk and rummaged through the 
contents. Old letters tied neatly in 
bundles. An old notebook from his 
college days. A sheaf of clippedtogether documents that undoubtedly 
were outdated. A scrapbook littered 
with clippings that had not been 
pasted up. An album half filled with 
a cheap stamp collection. 

He squatted back on his heels and , 
turned the pages of the album lovingly, childhood memories coming 
bade again. Cheap stamps because he 
had 'had no money to buy the better 



ones. Gaudy ones because they had 
appealed to him. The stamp craze, 
he remembered, had lasted two years 
. . . three years at the most. He had 
pored over catalogs, had traded, 
picked up the strange lingo of the 
hobby . . . perforate, imperforate, 
shades, watermarks, intaglio. 

He smiled at the happiness of 
memory. There had been stamps he'd 
wanted, but could never have, and 
he had studied the illustrations of 
them until he knew each one by 
heart. He lifted his head and stared 
hard at the wall and tried to remember what some of them were like, 
but there was no recollection. The 
once all-important thing had been 
buried by more than fifty years of 
other all-important matters. 

HE LAID the album to one side, 
went at the trunk again. 
More notebooks and letters. Loose 
clippings. A curious-looking wrench. 
A well chewed bone that at one time 
probably had been the property and 
the solace of some loved but now 
forgotten family dog. 

Junk, said Sutton. Buster could 
have saved a lot of time by simply 
burning it. 

A couple of old newspapers. A 
moth-eaten pennant. A bulky letter 
that never had been opened. Sutton 
tossed it on top of the rest of the 
litter he had taken from the trunk, 
then hesitated, put out his hand and 
picked it up again. 

That stamp looked queer. The 
color, for one thing. 



44 




 



Memory ticked within his brain 
and he saw the stamp as he had seen 
it when a lad . . . not the stamp itself, of course, but the illustration of 
it in a catalog. 

He bent above the letter and 
caught a sudden, gasping breath. 

The stamp was old, incredibly 
old . . . incredibly old and worth 
. . . good Lord, how much was it 
worth? 

He tried to make out the postmark, but it was faint with time. 

He got up slowly and carried the 
letter to the table, bent above it, 
puzzling out the town name. 

BRIDGEP WIS 

Bridgeport, probably. And WIS? 
Some political division lost in the 
mist of time. 

July 198 

July, 1980 — something! 

Sutton's hand shook. 

AN unopened letter, mailed 6,000 
years ago. Tossed in with this 
heap of junk. Lying cheek by jowl 
with a tooth-scarred bone and a 
funny wrench. 

An unopened letter . . . and with a 
stamp that was worth a fortune. 

Sutton read the postmark again. 
Bridgeport, Wis. July, it looked like 
11 . . . July 11, 198—. The missing 
numeral in the year was too faint 
to make out. Maybe with a good 
glass it could be done. 

The address, faded but -still legible, said: 



Mr. John H. Sutton 

Bridgeport 

Wisconsin 

So that was what WIS was. Wisconsin. 

And the name was Sutton. 

Of course, it would 'be Sutton. 

What had Buster's android lawyer 
said? A trunk full of family papers. 

I'll have to look into historic 
geography, Sutton thought. I'll have 
to find out just where Wisconsin 
was. 

But John H. Sutton. That was another matter. Just another Sutton. 
One who had been dust these many 
years. A man who sometimes forgot 
to open up his mail. 

Sutton turned the letter and examined the flap. There was no sign 
of tampering. The adhesive was flaking with age and when he ran a fingernail along one corner, the mucilage came loose in a tiny shower of 
powder. The paper, he saw, was 
brittle and would require careful 
handling. 

A trunk full of family papers, 
the android Wellington had said 
when he came into the room and 
balanced himself very primly on the 
edge of a chair and laid his hat precisely on the table top. 

And it was a trunk full of junk 
instead. Bones and wrenches and 
paper clips and clippings. Old notebooks and letters and a letter that 
had been mailed 6,000 years ago 
and never had been opened. 

Did Buster know about the letter? 



TIME QUARRY 



45 



But even as he asked himself the 
question, Sutton knew that Buster 
did. 

And he had tried to hide it . . . 
and he had succeeded. He had 
tossed it in with other odds and 
ends, knowing that it would be 
found, but by the man for whom it 
was intended. For the trunk was deliberately made to appear of no importance. It was old and battered 
and the key was in the lock and it 
said there's nothing important inside, but if you want to waste your 
time, why, go ahead and look. And 
if anyone had looked, the clutter 
would have seemed worthless. 

SUTTON reached out and tapped 
the letter lying on the table. 
John H. Sutton, an ancestor sixty 
centuries removed. His blood runs 
in my veins, though many times 
diluted. But he was a man who 
lived and breathed and ate and died, 
who saw the sunrise against the 
green Wisconsin hills ... if Wisconsin had any hills, wherever it 
was. He felt the heat of summer 
and shivered in the cold of winter. 
He worried about many things, both 
big and small and most of them 
would be small, the way worries 
usually are. 

A man like me, although there 
would be minor differences. He had 
a vermiform appendix and it may 
have caused him trouble. He had 
wisdom teeth and they may have 
caused him trouble, too. And he 
probably died at eighty or earlier. 



And when I am eighty, Sutton 
thought, I will be just entering my 
prime. 

But there would be compensations. John H. Sutton would have 
lived closer to the Earth, for the 
Earth was all he had. He would have 
been unplagued by alien psychology 
and Earth would have been a living 
place instead of ■ a governing place 
where not a thing is grown for its 
economic worth, not a wheel is 
turned for economic purpose. He 
could have chosen his life work 
from the whole broad field of human endeavor instead of being 
forced into governmental work, into 
the job of governing a thin cobweb 
of galactic empire. 

And somewhere, lost now, there 
were Suttons before him, and after 
him — lost, too — many other Suttons. The chain of life runs smoothly from one generation to the next, 
and none of the links stands out, 
except, here and there, a link one 
sees by accident. By the accident of 
history, or the accident of myth, or 
the accident of not opening a letter. 

The door bell chimed and Sutton, startled, scooped up the letter 
and slid it into the inside pocket of 
his coat. 

"Come in," he called. 

It was Herkimer. "Good morning, 
sir," he said. 

Sutton glared at him. "What do 
you want?" 

"I belong to you," Herkimer told 
him blandly. "I'm part of your 
third of Benton's property." 



46 




 



"My third. ..." And then he remembered. 

It was the law. Whoever kills another in a duel inherits one third 
of the dead man's property. That 
was a law he had forgotten. 

"I hope you don't object," said 
Herkimer. "I am easy to get along 
with and very quick to learn and I 
like to work. I Can cook and sew 
and run errands and I can read and 
write." 

"And put the finger on me." 
"Oh, no, I never would do that." 
"Why not?" 

"Because you are my master." 
"We'll see," Sutton remarked 
sourly. 

"But I'm not all," said Herkimer. 
"There are other things. There's a 
hunting asteroid stocked with the 
finest game, and a spaceship. A small 
one, it's true, but very serviceable. 
There are several thousand dollars 
and an estate out on the West Coast 
and some wildcat planetary development stock and a number of other 
small things, too numerous to mention." Herkimer brought out a notebook. "I have them written out if 
you would care to listen." 
i-!'Not now," said Sutton. "I have 
work to do." 

Herkimer brightened. "Something 
I could do, no doubt? Something I 
could help with?" 

"Nothing," said Sutton. "I am 
going to see Adams." 

"I could carry your case. That one 
over there." 

"I'm not taking the case." 



"But, sir. ..." ' 

"You sit down and fold your 
hands and wait until I get back." 

"I'll get into mischief," the android warned. "I just know I will." 

"All right, then, there is something you can do. That case you 
mentioned. You can watch it." 

"Yes, sir," said Herkimer, plainly 
disappointed. 

"And don't waste your time trying 
to read what's in it," said Sutton. 
"You won't be able to." 

"Oh," said Herkimer, still more 
disappointed. 

"There's another thing. A girl by 
the name of Eva Armour lives in 
this hotel. Know anything about 
her?" 

HERKIMER shook his head. "But 
I have a cousin. ..." 
"A cousin? An android with a 
cousin?" 

"Yes, sir. She was made in the 
same laboratory as me and that 
makes her my cousin." 

"You have a lot of cousins, then." 

"Yes," said Herkimer, "I have 
many thousands and we stick together. Which," he said, very sanctimoniously, "is the way it should 
be with families." 

"You think this cousin might 
know something?" 

Herkimer shrugged. "She works 
in the hotel. She might know something." 

Sutton turned to the door. 

"You are to be congratulated, 
sir," said Herkimer. "You gave a 



TIME QUARRY 



very good account of yourself last 
night." 

Sutton turned back to the room. 
"Benton missed," he said. "I 
couldn't- help but kill him." 

Herkimer nodded. "But it isn't 
only that, sir. This happens to be 
the first time I ever heard of a man 
being killed by a bullet in the' arm." 

"In the arm?" 

"Precisely, sir. The bullet smashed 
his arm, but it didn't touch him 
otherwise. And he died."

ADAMS thumbed the lighter and 
waited for the flame to steady. 
His eyes were fixed on Sutton and 
there was no softness in them, but 
there were softness and irritability 
and a faint -unsureness in the man 
himself, hidden well, but undeniably 
there. 

That staring, Sutton told himself, 
is an old trick of his. He glares at 
you and keeps his face frozen like a 
sphinx and if you aren't used to him 
and on to all his tricks, he'll have 
you thinking that he knows everything. 

But he doesn't do the glaring quite 
as well as he use to do It. There's 
strain in him now and there was no 
strain in him twenty years ago. Just 
granite, and the granite is beginning 
to weather. There's something on his 
mind. There's something that isn't 
going well. 

Adams passed the lighter flame 
over the loaded bowl of his pipe, 



back and forth, deliberately taking 
his time, making Sutton wait. 

"You know, of course," said Sutton, speaking quietly, "that I can't be 
frank with you." 

The lighter flame snapped off and 
Adams straightened in his chair. 
"Eh?" he asked. 

Sutton grinned mentally. A passed 
pawn, he told himself. -That's what 
Adams is ... a passed pawn. 

He said aloud: "You know by 
now, of course, that I came back in 
a ship that could not fly. You know 
I had no spacesuit and that the ports 
were broken and the hull was riddled. I had no food and air and 
water, and 61 is eleven light years 
away." 

Adams nodded bleakly. "Yes, we 
know all that." 

"How I got back or what happened to me has nothing to do with 
my report and I don't intend to tell 
you." 

Adams rumbled at him, "Then 
why mention it at all?" 

"Just so you won't ask a lot of 
questions that will get no answer. It 
will save a lot of time." 

Adams leaned back and puffed his 
pipe contentedly. "You were sent out 
to get information, Ash. Any kind 
of information. Anything that would 
make Cygni more understandable. 
You represented Earth and you were 
paid by Earth and you surely owe 
Earth something." 

"I owe Cygni something, too," replied Sutton. "I owe Cygni my life. 
My ship crashed and I was killed."

Adams nodded. "Yes, that is what 
Clark said. He told me you were 
killed. Clark is a space construction 
engineer. Sleeps with ships and 
blueprints. He studied your ship and 
he calculated a graph of force coordinates. H,e reported that if you 
were inside the ship when it hit, you 
had to be dead." 

"It's wonderful," said Sutton, drily, 
"what a man can do with figures." 

Adams prodded him again. "Anderson said you weren't human." 

"I suppose Anderson could tell 
that by looking at the ship." 

Adams nodded. "No food, nor air. 
It was the logical conclusion for anyone to draw." 

Sutton shook his head. "Anderson 
is wrong. If I weren't human, you 
never would have seen me. I would 
not have come back at all. But I was 
homesick for Earth and you were expecting a report." 

"You took your time," Adams accused. 

"I had to be sure. I had to know. 
I had to be able to come back and 
tell you if the Cygnians were dangerous or if they weren't." 

"And which is it?" 

"They aren't dangerous." 

ADAMS waited and Sutton was 
silent. 

Finally Adams said: "And that is 
all?" 

"That is all," said Sutton. 

Adams tapped his teeth with the 
bit of his pipe. "I'd hate to have to 
send another man out to check up. 



Especially after I had told everyone 
you'd bring back all the data." 

"It wouldn't do any good," said 
Sutton. "No one could get through." 

"You did." 

"Yes, and I was the first. And because I was the' first, I also will be 
the last." 

Across the desk, Adams smiled 
winterly. "You were fond of those 
people, Ash." • 

"They aren't people." 

"Well . . . beings, then." 

"They aren't even beings. It's hard 
to tell you exactly what they* are. 
You'd laugh if I said what I really 
think they are." 

Adams grunted. "Try me." 

"Symbiotic abstractions. That's as 
close as I can come." 

Adams didn't laugh. "You mean 
they really don't exist?" 

"Oh, they exist, all right. They 
form symbiotic relationships that 
help them and their alien hosts. Not 
like parasites, unless maybe like the 
bacteria that release nitrogen in the 
soil for plants to live on. Only the 
bacteria and the plants are separate. 
They and their hosts aren't, and each 
helps the other." 

"But they're abstractions," Adams 
repeated. "They can't exist." 

"Not as we know the word," Sutton said. "They do, though." 

"And no one can get through 
again?" 

Sutton leaned forward. "Why 
don't .you cross Cygni off your list? 
Pretend it isn't there. There's no 
danger from Cygni. The Cygnians, 



TIME QUARRY 



49 



will never bother Man, and Man will 
never get there again. There's no use 
trying." 

"They aren't mechanical?" 

"No," said Sutton. "An abstraction can't be mechanical." 

Adams changed the subject. "How 
.old are you, Ash?" 

"Fifty-nine." 

"Just a kid," said Adams. "Just 
getting started." His pipe had gone 
out and he worried the tobacco with 
his finger, scowling at it. "What do 
you plan to do?" he asked. 

"I have no plans." 

"You want to stay on with the 
Service, don't you?" 

"That depends on how you feel 
about it. I had presumed, of course, 
that you wouldn't want me." 

"We owe you twenty years back 
pay," said Adams, almost kindly. 
"•It's waiting for you. You can pick 
it up when you go out. You also have 
three or four years leave coming to 
you. Why don't you take it now?" 

Sutton said nothing. 

"Gome back later on," said Adams. 
"We'll have another talk." 

"I won't change my mind."' 

"No one will ask you to." 

Sutton stood up slowly. 

"I'm sorry," Adams said, "that I 
haven't your confidence." 

"I went out to do a job," Sutton 
told him crisply. "I've done that, job. 
I've made my report." 

"So you have." 

"I suppose," said Sutton, "you will 
keep in touch with me." 

Adams' eyes twinkled grimly. 



"Certainly, Ash. I shall keep in touch 
with you." 

XII 

SUTTON sat quietly in the room 
and forty years were canceled 
from his life. It was like going back 
•all of forty years . . . even to the 
teacups. 

Through the open windows of Dr. 
Raven's study came young voices and 
the sound of students' feet tramping 
past along the walk. The wind talked 
in the elms and it was a sound with 
which he was familiar. Far off a 
chapel bell tolled and there was girlish laughter just across the way. 

Dr. Raven handed him his teacup. 
"I think that I am right. Three 
lumps and no cream." 

"Yes, that's right," said Sutton, 
astonished that he should remember. 

But remembering, he told himself, 
was easy. I seem to be able to remember almost everything. As if the old 
habit patterns had been kept bright 
and polished in my mind through all 
the alien years. Waiting, like a set 
of cherished silver standing on a 
shelf, until it was time for them to 
be used again. 

"I remember little things," said 
Dr. Raven. "Little, inconsequential 
things, like how many lumps of 
sugar and what a man said sixty 
years ago, but I don't do so well, 
sometimes, at the big things . . . the 
things a man really should remember." 

The white marble fireplace flared 



50 




 




to the valuted ceiling and the university's coat of arms upon its polished face was as bright as the last 
day Sutton had 'seen it. 



»T SUPPOSE," he said, "you won
X der why I carrie." 

"Not at all," said Dr. Raven. "All 
my boys come back to see me. And I 
am glad to see them. It makes me 
feel so proud." 

"I've been wondering myself," 
said Sutton. "And I guess I know 
what it is, but it is hard to say." 

"Let's take it easy, then," said Dr. 
Raven. "Remember, the way we used 
to. We sat and talked around a thing 
and finally, before we knew it, we 
had found the core." 

Sutton laughed shortly. "Yes, I remember, doctor. Pine points of theology. The vital differences in comparative religions. Tell me this. You 
have spent a lifetime at it; you know 
more" about religions, Earthly and 
otherwise, than any man on Earth. 
Have you been able to keep one 
faith ? Have you been tempted from 
the teachings of your race?" 

Or. Raven set down his teacup. "I 
might have known you would embarrass me. You used to do it all the 
time. You had the uncanny ability 
to hit exactly on the question that a 
man found hardest to answer." 

"I won't embarrass you any 
longer," Sutton told him. "I take it 
that you have found some good — ■ 
one might say superior — points in 
alien religions." 

"You found a new religion?" 



, ' ... ■ 

"No," said Sutton. "Not a religion." 

The chapel bell kept on tolling 
and the girl who had laughed was 
gone. The footsteps along the walk 
were far off in the distance. 

"Have you ever felt," asked Sut- • 
ton, "as if you sat on God's right 
hand and heard a thing you knew 
you were never meant to hear?" 

Dr. Raven shook his head. "No, I 
don't think I ever have." 

"If you did, what would you do?" 

"I think," said Dr. Raven, "that I 
might be as troubled by it as you 
are." 

"We've lived by faith alone," said 
Sutton, "for ten thousand years at 
least. More — much more. For it 
must have been a glimmer of some 
sort of faith that made the Neanderthaler paint • corpses' shin bones, 
red and nest the skulls so they faced 
toward the east." 

"Faith," said Dr. Raven gently, 
"is a powerful thing." 

"Yes, powerful," Sutton agreed, 
"but even in its strength it is our 
own confession of weakness. Our 
own admission that we are not strong 
enough to stand alone, that we must 
have a hope and conviction that there 
is some greater power which will 
lend us aid and guidance." 

"You haven't grown bitter, Ash?" 

"Not bitter." 

Somewhere a clock was ticking, 
loud in the sudden hush. 

"Doctor," said Sutton, "what do 
you know of destiny?" 

"It's strange to hear you talk of 



TIME QUARRY 



51 



destiny," said Dr. Raven. "You always were a man who never was inclined to bow to destiny." 

"I mean documentary destiny," 
Sutton explained. "Not the abstraction, but the actual belief in destiny. 
What do the records say?" 

"There always have been men who 
believed in destiny," said Dr. Raven. 
"Some of them, it would appear, 
with some justification. But mostly 
they, didn't call it destiny. They 
called it luck or a hunch or inspiration or something else. There have 
been historians who wrote of manifest destiny, but those were no more 
than words. Of course, there were 
some fanatics who preached destiny, 
but practiced fatalism." 

"But there is no evidence of a 
thing called destiny? An actual 
force? A living vital thing?" 

Dr. Raven shook his head. "None 
that I know of, Ash. Destiny, after 
all, is just a word. It isn't something 
that you can pin down. Faith, too, 
at one time may have been no more 
than a word, just as destiny is today. But millions of people and thousands of years made it a real force, 
a thing that can be defined and invoked and lived by." 

"But hunches and luck," protested Sutton. "Those are just happenstance." 

"They might be glimmerings of 
destiny," Dr. Raven declared. 
"Flashes showing through. A hint of 
a broad stream of happening behavior. One cannot know, of course. 
Man is always blind until he has the 



facts. Turning points in history have 
rested on a hunch. Inspired belief in 
one's own ability has changed the 
course of events more times than one 
can count." 

' He rose and walked to a book 
case, stood with his head tilted back. 

"Somewhere," he said, "if I can 
find it, there is a book." 

He searched and did not find it. 

"No matter," he declared, "I'll 
run onto it later if you are still interested. It tells about an old African 
tribe with aT strange belief. They believed that each man's spirit' or consciousness or ego or whatever you 
may call it had a partner, a counterpart on some distant star. If I remember rightly, they even knew 
which star and could point it out 
in the evening sky." 

He turned around from the book 
case and looked evenly at Sutton. 

"That might be destiny, you 
know," he said. "It might, very well, 
at that." 

He crossed the room to stand in 
front of the cold fireplace, hands 
locked behind his back, silver head 
tilted to one side. 

"Why are you so interested in 
destiny?" he asked. 

"Because I found destiny," said 
Sutton. 

XIII 

THE face in the visiplate was 
masked and Adams spoke ' in 
chilly anger: "I do not receive 
masked calls."

"You will this one," said the 
voice from behind the mask. "I am 
the man you talked to on the patio. 
Remember?" 

"Calling from the future, I presume," said Adams. 

"No, I am still in your time. I 
have been watching you." 

"Watching Sutton, too?" 

The masked head nodded. "You 
have seen him now. What do you 
think?" 

"He's hiding something," Adams 
said. "And not all of him is human." 

"You're going to have him 
killed?" 

"No," said- Adams. "No, I don't 
think I will. He knows something 
that we need to know. And we 
won't get it out of him by killing." 

"What he knows," said the 
masked voice, "is better dead with 
the man. who knows it." 

"Perhaps," said Adams, "we 
could come to an understanding if 
you would tell me what this is all 
about." 

"I can't tell you, Adams. I wish I 
could. I can't tell you the future." 

"And until you do," snapped 
Adams, "I won't let you change the 
past." 

And he was thinking: The man 
is scared and almost desperate. He 
could kill Sutton any time he wished, 
but he is afraid to do it. Sutton has 
to be killed by a man of his own 
time . . . literally has to be, for 
time may not tolerate the intrusion 
of violence from future to past. 



"By the way," said the future 
man, "how are things on Aldebaran 
XII?" 

ADAMS sat rigid in his chair, anger flaming in him. 
"If it hadn't been for Sutton," 
■ said the masked man, "there would 
have been no incident on Aldebaran 
XII." 

"But Sutton wasn't back yet," 
argued Adams. His voice ran down, 
for he remembered something. The 
name upon the fly leaf . . . by Asher 
Sutton. "Look, tell me. For the love 
of heaven, if you have anything to 
tell, tell it." 

"You mean to say you haven't 
guessed what it might be?" 

Adams shook his head. 

"It's war," the voice said. 

"But there is no war." . 

"Not in your time." 

"But how — " 

"Remember Michaelson?" 

"The man who went a second 
into time." ■, 

The masked head nodded and the 
screen went blank. Adams sat and 
felt the chill of horror trickle 
through his body. 

The visor buzzer purred at him 
and mechanically he snapped the 
toggle over. 

It was Nelson in the screen. "Sutton just left the university. He spent 
an hour with Dr. Raven. In case 
you don't recall, Dr. Raven is a 
professor of comparative religions." 

"Oh," said Adams. "Oh, so that 
is it." 



TIME QUARRY 



53 



He tapped his fingers on the desk, 
half irritated, half frightened. 

'It would be a shame, he thought, 
to kill a man like Sutton. 

But it might be best. 

Yes, he told himself, it might be 
for the best. 

XIV 

rIE road curved ahead, a silver 
strip shining in the moonlight, 
and the sounds and smells of night 
lay across the land. The sharp, clean 
smell of growing things, the mystery smell of water. A creek ran 
through the marsh that lay off to 
the right, and Sutton, from behind 
the wheel, caught the flashing hint 
of winding, moonlit water as he 
took a curve. Peeping frogs made a 
veil of pixy sound that hugged 
against the hills, and fireflies were 
swinging lanterns that signaled 
through the dark. 

Clark said that Sutton had died, 
and Clark was an engineer. He had 
made a graph and mathematics 
stated that certains strains and 
stresses would inevitably kill a man. 

And Anderson had said Sutton 
wasn't human, and how was Anderson to know? 

How, asked Sutton, unless he examined me? Unless he was the one 
who tried to probe into my mind 
after I had been knocked out when 
I walked into my room? 

Adams had tipped his hand and 
Adams never tipped his hand unless he wanted one to see. He wanted 



me to know, Sutton told himself. 
He wanted me to know, but he 
couldn't tell me. He couldn't tell 
me he had me down on tape and 
film, that he was the one who had 
rigged up the room. 

But he could let me know by 
making just one slip, a carefully calculated slip, like the one on Anderson. He knew that I would catch and 
he thinks he can jitter me. 

The headlights caught, momentarily, the gray-black massive lines of 
a house that huddled on a hillside, 
and then there was another curve. 
A nightbird, black and ghostly, fluttered across the road and the shadow 
of its flight danced down the cone 
of light. 

Adams was the one who was waiting for me. He knew, somehow, 
that I was coming, and he was ready. 
He had me tagged and ticketed before I hit the ground, and he gave 
me a going over before I knew what 
was going on. 

And undoubtedly he found a 
whole lot more than he bargained 
for. 

Sutton chuckled drily. And the 
chuckle merged into a scream that 
came slanting down the hill slope 
in a blaze of streaming fire ... a 
rush of flame that ended in the 
marsh, that died down momentarily, 
then licked out in blue -and red. 

Brakes hissed and tires screeched 
on the pavement as Sutton slued the 
car around to bring it to a stop. 
Even before the machine came to a 
halt, he was out the door and run


54 




 



ning down the slope toward the 
strange, black craft that flickered in 
the swamp. 

Water sloshed around his ankles 
and knife-edged grass slashed at his 
leg. The puddles gleamed black and 
oily in the light from the flaming 
craft. The frogs still strained their 
hoarse throats at the far edge of the 
marsh. 

Something flopped and struggled 
in a pool of muddy, flame-stained 
water just a few feet from the burning ship. Sutton, plunging forward, 
caught the gleaming white of frightened, piteous eyeballs shining in the 
flame as the man lifted himself on 
his mud-caked arms and tried to 
drag his body forward. He saw the 
flash of teeth as pain twisted the 
face into grisly anguish. And his 
nostrils caught the smell of charred, 
crisped flesh. 

He stooped and locked his hands 
beneath the armpits of the man, 
hauled him upright, dragged him 
back across the swamp. Mud sucked 
at his feet and he heard the splashing behind him, the horrible, dragging splash of the other's body trailing through the water and the slime. 

There was dry land beneath his 
feet and he began the climb back up 
the slope* toward the car. Sounds 
came from the bobbing head of the 
man he carried, thick, slobbering 
sounds that might have been words. 

Sutton cast a quick glance over 
his shoulder and saw the flames 
mounting straight into the sky, a 
pillar of blue that lighted up the 



night. Marsh birds, roused from 
their nests, flew blinded and in 
squawking panic through the garish 
light. 

"The atomics," said Sutton, aloud. 
"The atomics. . . ." 

They couldn't hold for long in a ' 
flame like that. The automatics 
would melt down and the marsh 
would suddenly be a crater and the 
hills would be charred from horizon 
to horizon. 

"No," said the bobbing head. 
"No ... no atomics." 

Sutton's foot caught in a root and 
he stumbled to his knees. The body 
of the man slid from his mud-caked 
grasp. The man struggled, trying to 
turn over. Sutton helped him and he 
lay on his back, his face toward the 
sky. 

He was young, Sutton saw, a 
youth beneath the mask of mud and 
pain. 

"No atomics," said the man. "I 
dumped them." 

THERE was pride in the words, 
pride in a job well done. But 
the words had cost him heavily. 
Sutton saw the blood pumping 
through the temples beneath the 
burned and twisted skin. The man's 
jaw worked and words came out, 
limping, tangled words. 

"There was a battle . . . back in 
'83 ... I saw him coming . . . tried 
to time-jump. . . ." The words 
gurgled and got lost, then gushed 
out again. "Got new guns ... set 
metal afire. . . ." 



TIME QUARRY 



55 



He turned his head and apparently saw Sutton for the first time. 
He started up. "Asher Sutton!" The 
two words were a whisper. 

For a moment Sutton caught the 
triumphant, almost fanatic gleam 
that washed across the eyes of the 
dying man, wondered at the gesture 
of the half-raised arm, at the cryptic 
sign that the fingers made. 

Then the gleam faded and the 
arm dropped back and the fingers 
separated. 

Sutton knew, even before he bent 
with his head turned against the 
heart, that" the man was dead. 



Slowly Sutton stood up. The flame 
was dying down and the birds had 
gone. The craft lay almost buried 
in the mud, and its lines, he noted, 
were none he had ever seen. 

Asher Sutton, the man had said. 
And his eyes had lighted up and he 
had made a sign just before he died. 
And there had been a battle back 
in '83. 

Eighty-three what? 

The man had tried to time-jump 
. . . who had ever heard of a time 
jump? 

•I never saw the man before, said 
Sutton. So help me, I don't know 




56 




 



him even now. And yet he cried my 
name and it sounded as if he knew 
me and ,was very glad to see me and 
he made a sign ... a sign that went 
with the name. 

He stared down at the dead man 
lying at his feet and saw the pity of 
it, the crumpled legs, the stiffened 
arms, the lolling head and the flash 
of moonlight on the teeth where the 
mouth had fallen open. 

Carefully, Sutton went down on 
his knees, ran his hands over the 
body, seeking something . . . some 
bulging pocket that might give a 
clue to the man who lay there dead. 

Because he knew me. And I must 
know how he knew me. And none 
of it makes sense. 

There was a small book in the 
breast pocket of the coat and Sutton 
slipped it out. The title was in gold 
upon black leather, and even in the 
moonlight Sutton could read the letters that flamed from the cover: 

THIS IS DESTINY 
By 

Asher Sutton 



Sutton did not move. He .crouched 
there on the ground, like a cowering 
thing, stricken by-the golden letters 
on the leather cover. 

A book! 

A book he meant to write, but. 
hadn't written yet! 

A book he wouldn't write for 
many months to come! 

And yet here it was, dog-eared 
and limp from reading. 

He felt the chill of the fog rising 
from the marsh, the loneliness of a 
wild bird's crying. 

A strange ship had plunged into 
the marsh, disabled and burning. A 
man had escaped from the ship, but 
on the verge of death. Before hedied he had recognized Sutton and 
had called his name. In his pocket 
he had a book that was not even 
written. 

Those were the facts. There was 
no explanation. 

Faint sounds of human voices 
drifted down the night and Sutton 
rose swiftly to his feet, stood poised 
and waiting, listening. The voices 
came again. 




TIME QUARRY 



57 



Someone had heard the crash and 
was coming to investigate, coming 
down the road, caliing to others who 
•also had heard the crash. 

Sutton turned and walked swiftly 
up the slope to the car. 

There was, he told himself, no 
Earthly use of waiting. Those coming down the road might know the 
answers to his baffling questions — 
but they wouldn't tell him. Nobody 
seemed willing to tell him anything. 
He had to find out the answers himself. 

XV 

A MAN was waiting in the clump 
of lilac bushes across the road 
and there was another one crouched 
in the shadow of the courtyard wall. 

Sutton walked slowly forward, 
strolling, taking his time. 

"Johnny," he said, soundlessly. 
"Yes, Ash." 

"That is all there are? Just those 
two?" 

"I think there is another one, but 
I can't place him. All of them are 
armed." 

Sutton felt the stir of comfort in 
his brain, the sense of self-assurance, 
the sense of aid and comradeship. 

"Keep me posted, Johnny." 

He whistled a bar or two, from 
a tune that had been forgotten long 
ago, but still was fresh in his mind 
from twenty years before. 

The rent-a-car garage was two 
blocks up the road, the Orion Arms 
two blocks farther down. Between 
him and the Arms were two men, 



waiting with guns. Two and maybe 
more. 

Between the garage and hstel was 
nothing . . . just the landscaped 
beauty that was a residential, administrative Earth. An Earth dedicated to beauty and to ruling . . . 
planted with a garden's, care, every 
inch of it mapped out by landscape 
architects with clumps of shrubs and 
lanes of trees and carefully tended 
flower beds. 

An ideal place, Sutton told himself", for an ambush. 

Adams? he wondered. Although 
it hardly could be Adams. He had 
something that Adams expected to 
find out, and killing the man who 
holds information that you want, no 
matter how irate you may be at him, 
is downright useless. 

Or those others that Eva had told 
him of . . . the ones who had Benton psychologically conditioned to 
kill him. They tied in better than 
Adams did, for Adams wanted him 
to stay alive and these others, whoever they might be, were quite content to kill him. 

He dropped his hand in his coat 
pocket as if searching for a cigarette 
and his fingers touched the steel of 
the gun he had used on Benton. He 
let his fingers wrap around it "and 
then took his hand out of the pocket 
and found the cigarettes in another 
pocket. 

Not time yet, he told himself. 
Time later on to use the gun, if he 
had to use it — if he had a chance 
to use it. 



E8 




 



He stopped to light the cigarette, 
playing for time. The gun would be 
a poor weapon, he knew, but better 
than none at all. In the dark, he 
probably couldn't hit the broad side 
of a house* but it would make a 
noise and the waiting men were 
not counting on noise. If they hadn't 
minded noise, they could have 
stepped out minutes ago and shot 
him down. 

"Ash," said Johnny, "there is another man. Just in that bush ahead. 
He expects to let you pass and then 
they'll have you caught in an ambush 
three ways." 

SUTTON grunted. "Good, tell me 
exactly/' „ 
"The bush with the white flowers. He's on this edge of it. Quite 
close to the walk, so he can step 
around and be behind you when you 
_„pass." 

Sutton puffed on the cigarette, 
making it glow like a red eye in the 
dark. 

"Shall we take him, Johnny?" 

"Yes, before we're taken." 

Sutton resumed his stroll and now 
he saw the bush, four paces away, 
no more. 

One step. 

I wonder what it's all about. 
Two steps. 

Cut out your wondering. Act now 
and do your wondering later. 

Three steps. 

There he is. I see him. 

Sutton was off the walk in a sudden leap. The gun whipped out of 



his pocket and it talked, two quick, 
ugly words. 

The man behind the bush bent 
forward to his knees, swayed ther.e 
for a moment, then flattened on his . 
face. His gun fell from his fingers 
and in a single swoop, Sutton 
scooped it up. It was, he saw, an 
electronic device, a vicious thing that 
could killieven with a near miss, due 
to the field of distortion that its beam 
set up. A gun like that had been new 
and secret twenty years ago, but now, 
apparently, anyone could get it. 

Gun in hand, Sutton wheeled and 
ran, twisting through the shrubbery, 
ducking overhanging branches, ploVing through a tulip bed. Out of the 
corner of one eye, he caught a 
twinkle ... the twinkling breath of 
a silent flaming gun, and the dancing , 
path of silver that it sliced into the 
night. 

He plunged through a ripping, 
tearing hedge, waded a stream, found 
himself in a clump of evergreen and 
birch. He stopped to get his breath, 
staring back over the way that he 
had come. 

The countryside lay quiet and 
peaceful, a silvered picture painted 
by the moon. No one and nothing 
stirred. The gun long ago had ceased 
its flickering. 

Johnny's warning came suddenly: 
"Ash! Behind you. Friendly . . ." 

Sutton wheeled, gun half lifted. 

Herkimer was running in the 
moonlight, like a hound hunting for 
a trace. "Mr. Sutton, sir . . ."' 

"Yes, Herkimer." 



TIME QUARRY 



5? 



"We have to ran for it." 

"Yes," said Sutton, "I suppose we 
have. I walked into a trap. There 
were three of them laying for me." 

"It's worse than that," said Herkimer. "It's worse even than you 
think. It's not only Morgan, but it's 
Adams, too." 

"Adams?" 

"He has given orders that you are 
to be killed on sight." 

Sutton stiffened. "How do you 
know?" 

"The girl,' said Herkimer. "Eva. 
The one you asked about. She told 
me." 

Herkimer walked forward, stood 
face to face with Sutton. 

"You have to trust me, sir. You 
said this morning I'd put the finger 
on you, but I never would. I was 
with you from the very 'first." 

"But the girl," said Sutton. 

"Eva is with you,~roo, sir. We 
started searching for you as soon as 
we found out, but we were too late 



to catch you. Eva is waiting with the 
ship." 

"A ship," Sutton grimly repeated. 
"A ship and everything." 

"It's your own ship, sir. The one 
you received from Benton's estate 
with the hunting asteroid and me." 

Sutton scowled. "And you think 
I'm stupid enough to come with you 
and get into this ship and . . ." 

"No, sir, I didn't think so," said 
Herkimer. "I'm sorry." 

He moved so fast that Sutton 
couldn't do a thing. 

He saw the fist coming and he 
tried to raise his gun. He felt the 
sudden fury grow cold within his 
brain. But that was before there was 
a sudden crushing impact. His head 
snapped back so that for a moment, 
before his eyelids closed, he saw the 
wheel of stars against a spinning sky. 
He felt his knees buckle under him. 

He was out, stone cold, when his 
body hit the ground.
