BELLY LAUGH By IVAR JORGENSEN 

You hear a lot of talk these days about secret weapons. If it's not 
a new wrinkle in nuclear fission, it's a gun to shoot around corners 
and down winding staircases. Or maybe a nice new strain of bacteria 
guaranteed to give you radio-active dandruff. Our own suggestion is 
to pipe a few of our television commercials into Russia and bore the 
enemy to death. 

Well, it seems that Ivar Jorgensen has hit on the ultimate engine 
of destruction: a weapon designed to exploit man's greatest weakness. 
The blueprint can be found in the next few pages; and as the soldier 
in the story says, our only hope is to keep a sense of humor! 



ME? I'm looking for my outfit. 
Cot cut off in th.it Holland 
Tunnel attack. Mind if I sit down 
with you guys a while? Thanks. 
Coffee? Damn! This is heaven. 
Ain't seen a cup of coffee in a year. 

What? You said it! This sure is 
a hell of a war. Tough on a guy's 
feet. Yeah, that's right. Holland 



Tunnel skirmish. Where the Rusk- 
ies used that new gun. Uhuh. God ! 
It was awful. Guys popping off all 
around a guy and him not know- 
ing why. No sense to it. No noise. 
No wound. Just popping off. 

That's the trouble with this 
war. It won't settle down to a rou- 
tine. Always something new. What

the hell chance has a guy got to 
figure things out? And I tell you 
them Ruskies are coming up with 
new weapons j ust as fast as we are. 
Enough to make your hair stand 
on end. 

Sugar? Christ, yes! Ain't seen 
sugar for a year. You see, it's like 
this: we were bottled up in the pits 
around the Tunnel for seven damn 
days. It was like nothing you ever 
saw before. Oops — sorry. Didn't 
mean to splash you. I was laugh- 
ing about something that hap- 
pened there — to a guy. Maybe 
you guys would get a kick out of 
it. After all, we got to keep our 
sense of humor. 

' You sec, there was me and a 
Kentucky kid named Stillwell in 
this pit — a pretty big pit with 
lots of room — and we were all 
alone. This Stillwell was a nice kid 
— green and lonesome and it's 
pretty sad, really, but there's a 
yak in it, and — as I say — we got 
to keep a sense of humor. 

Well, this Stillwell --a really 
green kid — is unhappy and just 
plain . drooling for his gal back 
home. He talks about his mother, 
of course, and his old man, but it's 
the girl that's really on his mind as 
you guys can plainly understand. 

He's seeing her every place — 
like spots in front of his eyes — 
nice spots doing things to him, 
when this Ruskie babe shows up. 

My gun came up without any 
orders from me just as she poked 
her puss over the edge of the pit, 



and — huh? Oh, thank you kindly. 
It sure tastes good but I don't 
want to short you guys. Thank 
you kindly. 

Well, as I was saying, this Ruskie 
babe pokes her nose over the edge 
of the pit and Stillwell dives and 
knocks down my gun. He says, 
"You son-of-a-bitch ! " Just like 
that. Wild and desperate, like 
you'd say to a guy if the guy was 
just kicking over the last jug of 
water on a desert island. 

It would have been long enough 
for her to kill us if I hadn't had 
good reflexes. Even then, all I had 
time to do was knock the pistol 
out of her hand and drag her into 
the pit. 

With her play bollixed, she was 
confused and bewildered. She ain't 
a fighter, and she sits back against 
the wall staring at us dead pan 
with big expressionless eyes. She's 
a plenty pretty babe and I could 
see exactly what had happened as 
far as Stillwell was concerned. His 
spots had come to life in very ade- 
quate form so to speak. 

Stillwell goes over and sits down 
beside her and I'm very much on 
the alert, because I know where 
his courage comes from. But I de- 
cide it's all right, because I see the 
babe is not belligerent, just con- 
fused kind of. And friendly. 

And willing. Kind of a whipped- 
littlc-dog willing, and man oh man ! 
She was sure what Stillwell needed. 

They kind of went together like

a hand and a glove — natural-like. 
And it followed — pretty natural 
— that when StiUwell got up and 
led her around a wing of the pit, 
out of sight, she went willing — 
like that same little dog. 

Uhuh. No, you guys. Two's 
enough. I wouldn't rob you. Well, 
okay, and thanks kindly. 

Well, there I was, all alone, but 
happy for StiUwell, cause I know 
it's what the kid needs, and in 
spots like that what difference 
does it make? Yank — Ruskie — 
Mongolian — as long as she's will- 
ing. 

Then, you guys, StiUwell comes 
back out — wall-eyed — real wall- 
eyed — like being hit but not 
knocked out and still walking. I 
know what it is — some kind of 
shock. I get up and walk over and 
take a look at the babe where he'd 
left her — and I bust out laugh- 
ing, I told you guys there was a 
yak in this. I laughed like a fool — 



it was that funny. As much as I 
had time to, before StiUwell cracked. 
It was enough to crack him — the 
lit tle thing that pushes a guy over 
the edge. 

He lets out a yell and screams, 
"For crisake! For crisake! Noth- 
ing but a bucket of bolts! Nothing 
but a couple of plastic lumps — " 

That was when I hit him. 1 had 
to. He was for the birds, StiUwell 
was. An hour later we got relievo 1 
and a couple of medicos carried 
him away strapped to a stretcher 
— gone like a kite. 

They took the robot too, and its 
clothes, but they forgot the bras- 
siere, so I took it and 1 been carry- 
ing it ever since, but I'll leave it 
with you guys if you want — for 
the coffee. Might make you think 
about home. After all, like the 
man says, we got to keep our 
sense of humor. 

Well, so long, you guys — and 
thanks.
