MARS CONFIDENTIAL! by Jack Lait & Lee Mortimer 




Here is history's biggest news scoop! Those intrepid reporters 
Jack I^ait and Lee Mortimer, whose best-selling exposes of life's 
seamy side from New York to Medicine Hat have made them 
fatuous, here strip away the veil of millions of miles to bring 
you the lowdown on our sister planet. It is an amazing account 
of vice and violence, of virtues and victims, told in vivid, 
jet-speed style. 

Here you'll learn why Mars is called the Red Planet, the 
part /he Mafia, plays in her undoing, the rape and rapine 
that has made this heavenly body the cesspool of the Universe. 
In other words, this is Mars — Confidential! 



P-s~s-S"S-t ! 

HERE We go again — 

Confidential. 

We turned New York inside 
out. We turned Chicago upside 
down. In Washington we turned 
the insiders out and the outsiders 
in. The howls can still he heard 
since we dissected the U.S.A. 

But Mars was our toughest 
task of spectroscoping. The cab 



drivers spoke a different language 
and tin- hell-hops couldn't read 
our currency. Yet, we lliink we 
have X-rayed the dizziest and 
this mayamaze you — thedirtiesl 
planet in the solar system. Beside 
it, the Earth is as white as the 
Moon, and Chicago is as peaceful 
as the Milky Way. 

By the time we went through 
Mars — its canals, its caves, its 



4 



satellites and its catacombs — we 
knew more about it than anyone 
who lives there. 

We make no attempt to be 
comprehensive. We have no hope 
or aim to make Mars a better 
place in which to live; in fact, we 
don't give a damn what kind of a 
place it is to live in. 

This will be the story of a planet 
that could have been another 
proud and majestic sun with a 
solar system of its own ; it ended 
up, instead, in the comic books 
and the pulp magazines. 

We give you mars confiden- 
tial!

THE LOWDOWN 
CONFIDENTIAL 

Before the space ship which 
brings the arriving traveler 
lands at the Martian National 
Airport, it swoops gracefully over 
the nearby city in a salute. The 
narrow ribbons, laid out in geo- 
metric order, gradually grow wider 
until the water in these man- 
made rivers becomes crystal clear 
and sparkles in the reflection of 
the sun. 

As Mars comes closer, the visi- 
tor from Earth quickly realizes it 
has a manner and a glamor of its 
own; it is unworldy, it is out of 
this world. It is not the air of dis- 
tinction one finds in New York or 
London or Paris. The Martian 
feeling is dreamlike; it comes from 



being close to the stuff dreams are 
made of. 

However, after the sojourner 
lands, he discovers that Mars is 
not much different than the planet 
he left; indeed, men are pretty 
much the same all over the uni- 
.verse, whether they carry their 
plumbing inside or outside their 
bodies. 

As we unfold the rates of crime, 
vice, sex irregularities, graft, 
cheap gambling, drunkenness, 
rowdyism and rackets, you will 
get, thrown on a large screen, a 
peep show you never saw on your 
TV during the science-fiction hour. 

Each day the Earth man spends - 
on Mars makes him feel more at 
home; thus, it comes as no sur- 
prise to the initiated that even 
here, at least 35,000,000 miles 
away from Times Square, there 
are hoodlums who talk out of the 
sides of their mouths and drive 
expensive convertibles with white- 
walled tires and yellow-haired 
frails. For the Mafia, the dread 
Black Hand, is in business here — 
tied up with the subversives — 
and neither the Martian Commit- 
tee for the Investigation of Crime 
and Vice, nor the Un- Martian 
Activities Committee, can dent it 
more than the Kefauver Commit- 
tee did on Earth, which is prac- 
tically less than nothing. 

This is the first time this story 
has been printed. We were offered 
four trillion dollars in bribes to

hold it up; our Uvea were threat- 
ened and we were shot at with 
death ray guns. 

We got this one night on the 
fourth bench in Central Park, 
where we met by appointment a 
man who phoned us earlier but 
refused to tell his name. When we 
took one look at him we did not 
ask for his credentials, we just 
knew he came from Mars. 

This is what he told us: 

Shortly after the end of World 
War II, a syndicate composed of 
underworld big-shots from Chi- 
cago, Detroit and Greenpoint 
planned to build a new Las Vegas 
in the Nevada desert. This was to 
be a plush project for big spend- 
ers, with Vegas and Reno reserved 
for the hoi-polloi. 

There was to be service by a 
private airline. It would be BO 
ultra-ultra that suckers with only 
a million would be thumbed away 
and guys with two million would 
have to come in through the back 
door. 

The Mafia sent a couple of front 
men to explore the desert. Some- 
where out beyond the atom proj- 
ect they stumbled on what seemed 
to be the answer to their prayer. 

It was a huge, mausoleum-like 
structure, standing alone in the 
desert hundreds of miles from no- 
where, unique, exclusive and mys- 
terious. The prospectors assumed 
it was the last remnant of some 
fabulous and long -dead ghost- 
mining town. 



The entire population consisted 
of one, a little duffer with a white 
goatee and thick lensed specta- 
cles, wearing boots, chaps and a 
silk hat. 

"This your place, bud?" one of 
the hoods asked. 

When he signified it was, the 
boys bought it. The price was 
agreeable — after they pulled a 
wicked- looking rod. 

Then the money guys came to 
look over their purchase. They 
couldn't make head or tail of it, 
and you can hardly blame them, 
because inside the great structure 
they found a huge contraption 
that looked like a cigar (Havana 
Perfecto) standing on end. 

"What the hell is this," they 
asked the character in the opera 
hat, in what is known as a menac- 
ing attitude. 

The old pappy guy offered to 
show them. He escorted them into 
the cigar, pressed a button here 
and there, and before you could 
say "Al Capone" the roof of the 
shed slid back and they began to 
move upward at a terrific rate of 
speed. 

Three or four of the Mafia 
chieftains were old hop-heads and 
felt at home. In fact, one of them 
remarked, "Boy, are we gone." 
And he was right. 

The soberer Mafistas, after re- 
covering from their first shock, 
laid ungentle fists on their con- 
ductor. 



MARS CONFIDENTIAL 



"What goes on?" he was asked. 

"This is a space ship and we 
are headed for Mars." 

"What's Mars?" 

"A planet up in space, loaded 
with gold and diamonds." 

"Any bims there?" 

"I beg your pardon, sir. What 
are bims? " 

"Get a load of this dope. He 
never heard of bims. Babes, 
broads, frails, pigeons, ribs — 
catch on?" 

"Oh, I assume you mean girls. 
There must be, otherwise what 
are the diamonds for?" 

The outward trip took a week, 
but it was spent pleasantly. Dur- 
ing that time, the Miami delega- 
tion cleaned out Chicago, New 
York and Pittsburgh in a klabiash 
game. 

The hop back, for various rea- 
sons, took a little longer. One rea- 
son may have been the condition 
of the crew. On the return the 
boys from Brooklyn were primed 
to the ears with zorkle. 

Zorkle is a Martian medicinal 
distillation, made from the milk 
of the scksnoogle — a six-legged 
cow, seldom milked because few 
Martians can run fast enough to 
catch one. Zorkle is strong enough 
to Hp steel plates out of battle- 
ships, but to stomachs accustomed 
to Lhe stuff sold in Flatbush, it 
acted like a gentle stimulant. 

Upon their safe landing in 
Nevada, the Columbuses of this 
first flight to Mars put in long- 



distance calls to all the other im- 
portant hoods in the country. 

The Crime Cartel met in Cleve- 
land — in the third floor front of 
a tenement on Mayfield Road. 
The purpose of the meeting was to 
"cut up" Mars. 

Considerable dissension arose 
over the bookmaking facilities, 
when it was learned that the radio- 
actlive surface of the planet made 
it unnecessary to send scratches 
and results by wire. On the con- 
trary, the steel-shod hooves of the 
animals set up a current which 
carried into every pool room, 
without a pay-off to the wire 
service. 

The final division found the 
apportionment as follows: 
New York mob: Real 
estate and invest- 
ments (if any) 
Chicago mob: Book- 
making and liquor 
(if any) 

Brooklyn mob: Pro- 
tection and assas- 
sinations 

Jersey mob: Num- 
bers (if any) and 
craps (if any) 
Los A ngeles mob: 
Girls (if any) 
Galveston and New 
Orleans mobs: Dope 
(if any) 

Cleveland mob: Ca- 
sinos (if any) 
Detroit mob: Sum- 
mer resorts (if any)

AMAZING STOKIES 



The Detroit boys, incidentally, 
burned up when they learned the 
Martian year is twice as long as 
ours, consequently it takes two 
years for one summer to roll 
around. 

After the summary demise of 
three Grand Councilors whose 
deaths were recorded by the press 
as occurring from "natural 
causes," the other major and 
minor mobs were declared in as 
partners. 

The first problem to be ironed 
out was how to speed up trans- 
portation ; and failing that, to con- 
struct spacious space ships which 
would attract pleasure-bent trade 
from Terra — Earth to you — 
with such innovations as roulette 
wheels, steam rooms, cocktail 
lounges, double rooms with hot 
and cold babes, and other such 
inducements. 

II 

THE INSIDE STUFF 
CONFIDENTIAL 

Remember, you got this first 
from Lait and Mortimer. And we 
defy anyone to call us liars — and 
prove it! 

Only chumps bring babes with 
them to Mars. The temperature is 
a little colder there than on Earth 
and the air a little thinner. So 
Terra dames complain one mink 
coat doesn't keep them warm; 
they need two. 

On the other hand, the gravity 



is considerably less than on Earth . 
Therefore, even the heaviest 
bim weighs less and can be pushed 
over with the greatest of ease. 

However, the boys soon discov- 
ered that the lighter gravity 
played havoc with the marijuana 
trade. With a slight tensing of 
the muscles you can jump 20 feet, 
so why smoke "tea" when you 
can fly like crazy for nothing? 

Martian women are bags, so 
perhaps you had better disregard 
the injunction above and bring 
your own, even if it means two 
furs. 

Did you ever see an Alaska 
klutch (pronounced klootch)? 
Probably not. Well, these Arctic 
horrors are Ziegfeld beauts com- 
pared to the Martian fair sex. 

They slouch with knees bent 
and knuckles brushing the ground, 
and if Ringling Bros, is looking 
for a mate for Gargantua, here is 
where U> find her. Yel, their man- 
ner is habitually timid, as though 
they've been given a hard time. 
From the look in their deep-set 
eyes they seem to fear abduction 
or rape; but not even the zoot- 
suited goons from Grcenpcrnt 
gave them a second tumble. 

The visiting Mafia delegation 
was naturally disappointed at this 
state of affairs. They had been 
led to believe by the little guy 
who escorted them that all Mar- 
tian dames resembled Marilyn 
Monroe, only more so, and the 
men were Adonises (and not Joe). 



MAKS CONMDENT1AL

Seems they once were, at that. 
This was a couple of aeons ago 
when Earth men looked like Mar- 
tians do now, which seems to 
indicate that Martians, as well as 
Men, have their ups and downs. 

The citizens of the planet are 
apparently about halfway down 
the toboggan. They wear clothes, 
but they're not handstitched. 
Their neckties don't come from 
Sulka. No self-respecting goon 
from Gowanus would care to be 
seen in their company. 

The females always appear in 
public fully clothed, which doesn't 
help them either. But covering 
their faces would. They buy their 
dresses at a place called Kress- 
Worth and look like Paris nou- 
veau riche. 

There are four separate nations 
there, though nation is hardly the 
word. It is more accurate to say 
there are four separate clans that 
don't like each oilier, though how 
they can tell the difference is 
beyond us. They are known as the 
East Side, West Side, North Side 
and Gas House gangs. 

Each stays in its own back- 
yard. Periodic wars are fought, a 
few thousand of the enemy are 
dissolved with ray guns, after 
which the factions retire by com- 
mon consent and throw a banquet 
at which the losing country is 
forced to take the wives of the 
visitors, which is a twist not yet 
thought of on Earth. 

Martian language is unlike 



anything ever heard below. 1 1 
would bafHe the keenest linguist, 
if the keenest linguist ever gets t<> 
Mars. However, the Mafia, which 
is a world-wide blood brotherhood 
with colonies in every land ami 
clime, has a universal language. 
Knives and brass kuueks are 
understood everywhere. 

The Martian lingo seems to be 
somewhat similar to Chinese. It's 
not what they say, but how they 
say It. For instance, psonqule may 
mean "J love you " or " you dirty 
son-of-a-bitch." 

The Mafistas soon learned t<> 
translate what the natives were 
saying by watching the squint in 
their eyes. When they s|x>ke with 
a certain expression, the mobsters 
let go with 45s, which, however, 
merely have a stunning effect on 
the gent on the receiving end 
because of the lesser gravity. 

On the other hand, the Martian 
death ray guns were not fatal to 
the toughs from Earlh; anyone 
who can live through St. Valen- 
tine's Day in Chicago can live 
through anything. So it came out 
a dead heat. 

Thereupon the boys from the 
Syndicate sat down and declared 
the Martians in for a fifty-fifty 
partnership, which means they 
actually gave them one per cent, 
which is generous at that. 

Never having had the great 
advantages of a New Deal, the 
Martians arc still backward and 
use gold as a means of exchange. 



10 



 



With no Harvard bigdomes to tell 
them gold is a thing of the past, 
the yellow metal circulates there 
as freely and easily as we once 
kicked pennies around before 
they became extinct here. 

The Mafistas quickly set the 
Martians right about the futility 
of gold. They eagerly turned it 
over to the Earth men in exchange 
for green certificates with pretty 
pictures engraved thereon. 

Iff 

RACKETS VIA ROCKETS 

Gold, platinum, diamonds and 
other precious stuff are as plenti- 
ful on Mars as hayfever is on 
Earth in August. 

When the gangsters lamped the 
loot, their greedy eyes and greasy 
fingers twitched, and when a 
hood ' s eyes and fingers twitch , 
watch out; something is twitch- 
ing. 

The locals were completely 
honest. They were too dumb to be 
thieves. The natives were not 
acquisitive. Why should they be 
when gold was so common it had 
no value, and a neighbor's wife so 
ugly no one would covet her? 

This was a desperate situation, 
indeed, until one of the boys from 
East St. Louis uttered the eternal 
truth : "There ain't no honest man 
who ain't a crook, and why should 
Mars be any different?" 

The difficulty was finding the 
means and method of corruption. 



All the cash in Jake Guzik's 
strong box meant nothing to a race 
of characters whose brats made 
mud pies of gold dust. 

The discovery came as an acci- 
dent. 

The first Earthman to be elim- 
inated on Mars was a two-bit 
hood from North Clark Street 
who sold a five-cent Hershcy bar 
with almonds to a Martian for a 
gold piece worth 94 bucks. 

The man from Mars bit the 
candy bar. The hood bit the gold 
piece. 

Then the Martian picked up a 
rock and beaned the lad from the 
Windy City. After which the 
Martian's eyes dilated and he let 
out a scream. Then he attacked 
the first Martian female who 
passed by. Never before had such 
a thing happened on Mars, and to 
say she was surprised is putting it 
lightly. Thereupon, half the fe- 
male population ran after the 
berserk Martian. 

When the organization heard 
about this, an investigation was 
ordered. That is how the crime 
trust found out that there is no 
sugar on Mars; that this was the 
first time it had ever been tasted 
by a Martian ; that it acts on them 
like junk does on an Earthman. 

They further discovered that 
the chief source of Martian diet is 
— believe it or not — poppy seed, 
hemp and coca leaf, and that the 
alkaloids thereof : opium, hash- 
heesh and cocaine have not the 



MARS CONFIDENTIAL 



slightest visible effect on them. 

Poppies grow everywhere, huge 
russet poppies, ten times as large 
as those on Earth and 100 times 
as deadly. It is these poppies 
which have colored the planet red. 
Martians are strictly vegetarian: 
they bake, fry and stew these 
flowers and weeds and eat them 
raw with a goo made From fungus 
and called szchmortz which passes 
for a salad dressing. 

Though the Martians were 
absolutely impervious to the nar- 
cotic qualities of the aforemen- 
tioned flora, they got higher than 
Mars on small doses of sugar. 

So the Mafia was in business. 
The Martians sniffed granulated 
sugar, which they called snow. 
They ate cube sugar, which they 
called "hard stuff", and they 
injected molasses syrup into their 
veins with hypos and called this 
"mainliners." 

There was nothing they would 
not do for a pinch of sugar. Gold, 
platinum and diamonds, nar- 
cotics by the acre — these were 
to be had in generous exchange 
for sugar — which was selling on 
Earth at a nickel or so a pound 
wholesale. 

The space ship went into shut- 
tle service. A load of diamonds 
and dope coming back, a load of 
sugar and blondes going up. 
Blondes made Martians higher 
even than sugar, and brought 
larger and quicker returns. 

This is a confidential tip to the 



South African diamond trust: ten 
space ship loads of precious stones 
are now being cut in a cellar on 
Bleecker Street in New York. 
The mob plans to retail them for 
$25 a carat! 

Though the gangsters are buy- 
ing sugar at a few cents a pound 
here and selling it for its weight 
in rubies on Mars, a hood is al- 
ways a hood. They've been cut- 
ting dope with sugar for years on 
Earth, so they didn't know how 
to do it any different on Mars. 
What to cut the sugar with on 
Mars? Simple. With heroin, of 
course, which is worthless there. 

This is a brief rundown on the 
racket situation as it currently 
exists on our sister planet. 

FAKED PASSPORTS: When 
the boys first landed they found 
only vague boundaries between 
the nations, and Martians could 
roam as they pleased. Maybe this 
is why they stayed close to home. 
Though anyway why should they 
travel ? There was nothing to 
see. 

The boys quickly took care of 
this. First, in order to make travel 
alluring, they brought 20 strippers 
from Calumet City and set them 
peeling just beyond the border 
lines. 

Then they went to the chief- 
tains and sold them a bill of 
goods (with a generous bribe of 
sugar) to close the borders. The 
next step was to corrupt the bor- 
der guards, which was easy with 



 



Annie Oakleys to do the burlesque 
shows. 

The selling price for faked pass- 
ports fluctuates between a ton 
and three tons of platinum, 

VICE: Until the arrival of the 
Earth men, there were no illicit 
sexual relations on the planet. In 

fact, no Martian in his right mind 
would have relations with the 
native crop of females, and they 
in turn felt the same way about 
the males. Laws had to be passed 
requiring all able-bodied citizens 
to marry and propagate. 

Thus, the first load of bims 
from South Akard Street in Dallas 
found eager customers. But these 
babes, who romanced anything in 
pants on earth, went on a stand-up 
strike when they saw and smclled 
the Martians. Especially smelled. 
They smelled worse than Texas 
yahoos just off a cow farm. 

This proved embarrassing, to 
say the least, to the procurers. 
Considerable sums of money were 
invested in this human cargo, and 
the boys feared dire consequences 
from their shylocks, should they 
return empty-handed. 

In our other Confidential essays 
we told you how the Mafia em- 
ploys some of the best brains on 
Earth to direct and manage its 
far-flung properties, including 
high-priced attorneys, account- 
ants, real-estate experts, engi- 
neers and scientists. 

A hurried meeting of the Grand 
Council was called and held in a 



bungalow on the shores of one of 
Minneapolis' beautiful lakes. The 
decision reached there was to cor- 
ner chlorophyl (which accounts in 
part for the delay in putting it on 
the market down here) and ship it 
to Mars to deodorize the populace 
there. After which the ladies of 
the evening got off their feet and 
went back to work. 

GAMBLING: Until the arrival 
of the Mafia, gambling on Mars 
was confined to a simple game 
played with children's jacks. The 
loser had to relieve the winner of 
his wife. 

The Mafia brought up some 
«fine gambling equipment, includ- 
ing the layouts from the Colonial 
Inn in Florida, and the Beverly in 
New Orelans, both of which were 
closed, and taught the residents 
how to shoot craps and play the 
wheel, with the house putting up 
sugar against precious stones and 
metals. With such odds, it was 
not necessary to fake the games 
more than is customary on Earth.

LITTLE NEW YORK 
CONFIDENTIAL 

Despite what Earth-bound pro- 
fessors tell you about the Martian 
atmosphere, we know better. They 
weren't there. 

It is a dogma that Mars has no 
oxygen. Baloney. While it is true 
that there is considerably less 
than on Earth in the surface at- 



MARS CONFIDENTIAL 



13 



mosphere, the air underground, m 
caves, valleys and tunnels, has 
plenty to support life lavishly, 
though why Martians want lo live 
after they look at each other we 
cannot tell you, even confidential. 

For this reason Martian cities 
are built underground, and travel 
between them is carried on through 
a complicated system of subways 
predating the New York I RT line 
by several thousand centuries, 
though to the naked eye there is 
little difference between a Brook- 
lyn express and a Mars express, 
yet the latter were built before 
the Pyramids. 

When the first load of Black 
Handers arrived, they naturally 
balked against living underground. 
It reminded them too much of the 
days before they went "legiti- 
mate" and were constantly on the 
lam and hiding out. 

So the Mafia put the Martians 
to work building a town. There 
are no building materials on the 
planet, but the Martians are 
adept at making gold dust hold 
together with diamond rivets. The 
result of their effort — for which 
they were paid in peppermint 
sticks and lump sugar — is named 
Little New York, with hotels, 
nightclubs, bars, haberdashers, 
Turkish baths and horse rooms. 
Instead of air-conditioning, it had 
oxygen-conditioning. But the town 
had no police station. 

There were no cops! 

Finally, a meeting was held at 



which one punk asked another, 
"What the hell kind of town is it 
with no cops? Who we going to 
bribe?" 

After some discussion they cut 
cards. One of the Bergen County 
boys drew the black ace. "What 
do I know about being a cop?" he 
squawked. 

' ' You ca n ta ke graft , ca n ' t 
you? You been shook down, ain't 
you?" 

The boys also imported a cou- 
ple of smart mouthpieces and a 
ship of blank habeas corpus Tortus, 
together with a judge who was the 
brother of one of the lawyers, so 
there was no need to build a jail 
in this model city. 

The only ones who ever get 
arrested, anyway, are the Mar- 
tians, and they soon discovered 
that the coppers from Terra would 
look the other way for a bucket 
full of gold. 

Until the arrival of the Earth- 
men, the Martians were, as stated, 
peaceful, and even now crime is 
practically unknown among them, 
The chief problem, however, is to 
keep them in line on pay nights, 
when they go on sugar binges. 

Chocolate bars are as common 
on Mars as saloons are on Broad- 
way, and it is not unusual to see 
"gone" Martians getting heaved 
out of these bars right into the 
gutter. One nostalgic hood from 
Seattle said it reminded him of 
Skid Row there.

AMAZING STORIKS 



V 

THE RED RED PLANET 

The gangsters h at i noJ; Det;n on 
Mars long before they heard ru- 
mors about other outsiders who 
were supposed to have landed on 
the other side of Ml. Sirehunz. 

The boys got together in a cock- 
tail lounge to talk this over, and 
they decided they weren't going 
to stand for any other mobs mus- 
cling in. 

Thereupon, they despatched 
four torpedoes with Tommy guns 
in a big black limousine to see 
what was going. 

We tell you this Confidential. 
What they found was a Commu- 
nist apparatus sent to Mars from 
Soviet Russia. 

This cell was so active that 
Commies had taken over almost 
half the planet before the arrival 
of the Mafia, with their domain 
extending from the Deucalionis 
Region all the way over to Pka- 
ethvntis and down to Titania. 

Furthermore, through propa- 
ganda and infiltration, there were 
Communist cells in every quarter 
of the planet, and many of the 
top officials of the four Martian 
governments were either secretly 
party members or openly in fronts. 

The Communist battle cry was: 
"Men of Mars unite; you have 
nothing to lose but your wives." 

Comes the revolution, they 
were told, and all Martians could 
remain bachelors. It is no wonder 



the Communists made such in- 
roads. The planet became known 
as "The Red Planet." 

In their confidential books about 
the cities of Earth, Lait and Mor- 
timer explored the community of 
interest between the organized 
underworld and the Soviet. 

Communists are in favor of 
anything that causes civil disorder 
and unrest ; gangsters have no 
conscience and will do business 
with anyone who pays. 

On Earth, Russia floods the 
Western powers, and especially 
the United States, with narcotics, 
first to weaken them and provide 
easy prey, and second, for dollar 
exchange. 

And on Earth, the Mafia, which 
is another international conspir- 
acy like the Communists, sells the 
narcotics. 




MARS CONFIDENTIAL 



15 



And so when the gangsters 
heard there were Communist cells 
on Mars, they quickly made a 
contact. 

For most of the world's cheap 
sugar comes from Russia! The 
Mafia inroad on the American 
sugar market had already driven 
cane up more than 300 per cent. 
But the Russians were anxious, 
able and willing to provide all the 
beets they wanted at half the com- 
petitive price. 

VI 

THE HONEST HOODS 

■ As we pointed out in previous 
works, the crime syndicate now 
owns so much money, its chief 
problem is to find ways in which 
to invest it. 

As a result, the Mafia and its 
allies control thousands of legiti- 
mate enterprises ranging from ho- 



tel chains to railroads and from 
laundries to distilleries. 

And so it was on Mars. With all 
the rackets cornered, the gang- 
sters decided it was time to go 
into some straight businesses. 

At the next get-together of the 
Grand Council, the following con- 
versation was heard : 

"What do these mopes need 
that they ain't getting?" 

"A big fat hole in the head." 

"Cut it out. This is serious." 

"A hole in the head ain't seri- 
ous?" 

"There's no profit in them one- 
shot deals." 

"It's the repeat business you 
make the dough on." 

" Maybe you got something 
there. You can kill a jerk only 
once." 

"But a jerk can have rela- 
tives." 

"We're talking about legit stuff.

All the rest has been taken rare 
of." 

''With the Martians I've seen, 
a bar of soap could be a big 
thing." 

From this random suggestion, 
there sprang up a major inter- 
planetary project. If the big soap 
companies are wondering where 
all that soap went a few years ago, 
we can tell them. 

It went to Mars. 
' Soap caught on immediately. 
It was snapped up as fast as it ar- 
rived. 

But several questions popptid 
into the minds of the Mafia soap 
salesman. 

Where was it all going? A 
Martian, in line for a bar in the 
evening, was back again the fol- 
lowing morning for another one. 

And why did the Martians stay 
just as dirty as ever? 

The answer was, the Martians 



stayed as dirty as ever because 
they weren't using the soap to 
wash with. They were eating it! 

1 1 cured the hangover from 
sugar. 

Another group cornered the un- 
dertaking business, adding a twist 
that made for more activity. They 
added a Department of Elimina- 
tion. The men in charge of this 
end of the business circulate 
through the chocolate and soap 
bars, politely inquiring, "Who 
would you like killed?" 

Struck with the novelty of the 
thing, quite a few Martians re- 
member other Martians they are 
mad at. The going price is one 
hundred carats of diamonds to 
kill; which is cheap considering 
the average laborer earns 10,000 
carats a week. 

Then the boys from the more 
dignified end of the business drop 
tn at the home of the victim and

offer to bury him cheap. Two hun- 
dred and fifty carats gets a Mar- 
tian planted in style. 

Inasmuch as Martians live un- 
derground, burying is done in 
reverse, by tying a rocket to the 
tail of the deceased and shooting 
him out into the stratosphere.

Mars is presently no problem

have all its gold and the Martians 
begin asking us for loans. 

Meanwhile, Lait and Mortimer

it. 

We believe Earth would weaken

Blast-off: The equivalent of the take-off 
of Terran aviation. Space ships 
blast-off into space. Not to be 
confused with the report of a 
sawed-off shot gun. 

Blasting pit: Place from which a space 
ship blasts off. Guarded area 
where the intense heat from the 
jets melts the ground. Also used 
for cock-fights. 

Spacemen: Those who man the space 
ships. See any comic strip. 

Hairoscope: A very sensitive instru- 
ment for space navigation. The

itself if it dissipated its assets 
on foreign planets. Instead, we 
should heavily arm our own satel- 
lites, which will make us secure 
from attack by an alien planet or 
constellation. 

At the same time, we should 
build an overwhelming force of 
space ships capable of delivering 
lethal blows to the outermost 
corners of the universe and return 
without refueling. 

We have seen the futility of 
meddling in everyone's business 
on Earth. Let's not make that 
mistake in space. We are unalter- 
ably opposed to the UP (United 
Planets) and call upon the gov- 
ernments of Earth not to join that 
[nter-Sblar System boondoggle. 

We have enough trouble right 
here. 



CONFIDENTIAL: 

tered around two crossed hairs. 
Because of the vastness of space," 
very fine hairs are used. These 
hairs are obtained from the 
Glomph-Frog, found only in the 
heart of the dense Venusian 
swamps. The hairoscope is a 
must in space navigation. Then 
how did they get to Venus to 
get the hair from the Glomph- 
Frog? Read Venus Confiden-

spacial methods by which the 
Russians compete for the minds 

 



of the Neptunians and the Pluto-

put into modernistic diving suits. 
The dames wear bras and pan- 
ties. 

Grav-plaUs: A form of magnetic shoe 
worn by spacemen while stand- 
ing on the outer hull of a space 
ship halfway to Mars. Why a 
spaceman wants to stand on the 
outer hull of a ship halfway to 
Mars is not clear. Possibly to 
win a bet. 

Spa-cc platform: A man-made satellite 
rotating around Earth between 
here and the Moon. Scientists 
say this is a necessary first step 
to interplanetary travel. Mars 
Confidential proves the fallacy 
of this theory. 

Space Academy: A college where young 
men are trained to be space- 
men. The student body consists 
mainly of cadets who served 
apprenticeships as elevator jock- 
eys. 

Asteroids: Tiny worlds floating around 
in space, put there no doubt to 
annoy unwary space ships. 

Extrapolation: The process by which a 
science- fiction writer takes an 
established scientific fact and 
builds thereon a story that 
couldn't happen in a million 
years, but maybe 2,000,000. 

Science, fiction: A genre of escape litera- 
ture which takes the reader to 
far-away planets — and usually 
neglects to bring him back. 

S.F.: An abbreviation for science fic- 
tion. 

Bern: A word derived by using the first 
letters of the three words: Bug

The pile: The source from which power 
is derived to carry men to the 
stars. Optional on the more ex- 
pensive space ships, at extra 
cost. 

Atom blaster: A gun carried by space- 
men which will melt people down 
to a cinder, A .45 would do just 
as well, but then there's the 
Sullivan Act. 

Orbit: The path of any heavenly body. 
The bodies are held in these 
orbits by natural laws the Re- 
publicans arc thinkingof repeal-

Nova: The explosive stage into which 
planets may pass. According to 
the finest scientific thinking, a 
planet will either nova, or it 
won't. 

Galaxy: A term used to confuse people
