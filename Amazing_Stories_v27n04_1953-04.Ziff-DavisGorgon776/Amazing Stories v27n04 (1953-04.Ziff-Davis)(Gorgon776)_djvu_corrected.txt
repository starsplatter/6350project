"My literary habits-consist mainly of a run- 
ning fight lo slay away from people, tele- 
phones, and correspondence long enough to 
get stories written down. I've no particular 
knowledge of the techniques of writing fic- 
tion and am afruid to find out, remembering 
what happened lo the eentipede who was 
asked kow he handled his legs. I become very 
attached to my characters and kill them off 
reluctantly. Am married to a wonderful rarity: 
an even-tempered redhead."

"I was a professional writer long before I 
Id vote, and lo dale have had published 
about 1,300 stories, 29 books, some motion- 
pictures, radio and TV plays. I've been pub-

MARS CONFIDENTIAL! 

Jack Lait & Lee Mortimer 




Here is history's biggest news scoop! Those intrepid reporters 
Jack I^ait and Lee Mortimer, whose best-selling exposes of life's 
seamy side from New York to Medicine Hat have made them 
fatuous, here strip away the veil of millions of miles to bring 
you the lowdown on our sister planet. It is an amazing account 
of vice and violence, of virtues and victims, told in vivid, 
jet-speed style. 

Here you'll learn why Mars is called the Red Planet, the 
part /he Mafia, plays in her undoing, the rape and rapine 
that has made this heavenly body the cesspool of the Universe. 
In other words, this is Mars — Confidential! 



P-s~s-S"S-t ! 

HERE We go again — 

Confidential. 

We turned New York inside 
out. We turned Chicago upside 
down. In Washington we turned 
the insiders out and the outsiders 
in. The howls can still he heard 
since we dissected the U.S.A. 

But Mars was our toughest 
task of spectroscoping. The cab 



drivers spoke a different language 
and tin- hell-hops couldn't read 
our currency. Yet, we lliink we 
have X-rayed the dizziest and 
this mayamaze you — thedirtiesl 
planet in the solar system. Beside 
it, the Earth is as white as the 
Moon, and Chicago is as peaceful 
as the Milky Way. 

By the time we went through 
Mars — its canals, its caves, its 



4 



satellites and its catacombs — we 
knew more about it than anyone 
who lives there. 

We make no attempt to be 
comprehensive. We have no hope 
or aim to make Mars a better 
place in which to live; in fact, we 
don't give a damn what kind of a 
place it is to live in. 

This will be the story of a planet 
that could have been another 
proud and majestic sun with a 
solar system of its own ; it ended 
up, instead, in the comic books 
and the pulp magazines. 

We give you mars confiden- 
tial! 

I 

THE LOWDOWN 
CONFIDENTIAL 

Before the space ship which 
brings the arriving traveler 
lands at the Martian National 
Airport, it swoops gracefully over 
the nearby city in a salute. The 
narrow ribbons, laid out in geo- 
metric order, gradually grow wider 
until the water in these man- 
made rivers becomes crystal clear 
and sparkles in the reflection of 
the sun. 

As Mars comes closer, the visi- 
tor from Earth quickly realizes it 
has a manner and a glamor of its 
own; it is unworldy, it is out of 
this world. It is not the air of dis- 
tinction one finds in New York or 
London or Paris. The Martian 
feeling is dreamlike; it comes from 



being close to the stuff dreams are 
made of. 

However, after the sojourner 
lands, he discovers that Mars is 
not much different than the planet 
he left; indeed, men are pretty 
much the same all over the uni- 
.verse, whether they carry their 
plumbing inside or outside their 
bodies. 

As we unfold the rates of crime, 
vice, sex irregularities, graft, 
cheap gambling, drunkenness, 
rowdyism and rackets, you will 
get, thrown on a large screen, a 
peep show you never saw on your 
TV during the science-fiction hour. 

Each day the Earth man spends - 
on Mars makes him feel more at 
home; thus, it comes as no sur- 
prise to the initiated that even 
here, at least 35,000,000 miles 
away from Times Square, there 
are hoodlums who talk out of the 
sides of their mouths and drive 
expensive convertibles with white- 
walled tires and yellow-haired 
frails. For the Mafia, the dread 
Black Hand, is in business here — 
tied up with the subversives — 
and neither the Martian Commit- 
tee for the Investigation of Crime 
and Vice, nor the Un- Martian 
Activities Committee, can dent it 
more than the Kefauver Commit- 
tee did on Earth, which is prac- 
tically less than nothing. 

This is the first time this story 
has been printed. We were offered 
four trillion dollars in bribes to 



6 



 



hold it up; our Uvea were threat- 
ened and we were shot at with 
death ray guns. 

We got this one night on the 
fourth bench in Central Park, 
where we met by appointment a 
man who phoned us earlier but 
refused to tell his name. When we 
took one look at him we did not 
ask for his credentials, we just 
knew he came from Mars. 

This is what he told us: 

Shortly after the end of World 
War II, a syndicate composed of 
underworld big-shots from Chi- 
cago, Detroit and Greenpoint 
planned to build a new Las Vegas 
in the Nevada desert. This was to 
be a plush project for big spend- 
ers, with Vegas and Reno reserved 
for the hoi-polloi. 

There was to be service by a 
private airline. It would be BO 
ultra-ultra that suckers with only 
a million would be thumbed away 
and guys with two million would 
have to come in through the back 
door. 

The Mafia sent a couple of front 
men to explore the desert. Some- 
where out beyond the atom proj- 
ect they stumbled on what seemed 
to be the answer to their prayer. 

It was a huge, mausoleum-like 
structure, standing alone in the 
desert hundreds of miles from no- 
where, unique, exclusive and mys- 
terious. The prospectors assumed 
it was the last remnant of some 
fabulous and long -dead ghost- 
mining town. 



The entire population consisted 
of one, a little duffer with a white 
goatee and thick lensed specta- 
cles, wearing boots, chaps and a 
silk hat. 

"This your place, bud?" one of 
the hoods asked. 

When he signified it was, the 
boys bought it. The price was 
agreeable — after they pulled a 
wicked- looking rod. 

Then the money guys came to 
look over their purchase. They 
couldn't make head or tail of it, 
and you can hardly blame them, 
because inside the great structure 
they found a huge contraption 
that looked like a cigar (Havana 
Perfecto) standing on end. 

"What the hell is this," they 
asked the character in the opera 
hat, in what is known as a menac- 
ing attitude. 

The old pappy guy offered to 
show them. He escorted them into 
the cigar, pressed a button here 
and there, and before you could 
say "Al Capone" the roof of the 
shed slid back and they began to 
move upward at a terrific rate of 
speed. 

Three or four of the Mafia 
chieftains were old hop-heads and 
felt at home. In fact, one of them 
remarked, "Boy, are we gone." 
And he was right. 

The soberer Mafistas, after re- 
covering from their first shock, 
laid ungentle fists on their con- 
ductor. 



MARS CONFIDENTIAL 



"What goes on?" he was asked. 

"This is a space ship and we 
are headed for Mars." 

"What's Mars?" 

"A planet up in space, loaded 
with gold and diamonds." 

"Any bims there?" 

"I beg your pardon, sir. What 
are bims? " 

"Get a load of this dope. He 
never heard of bims. Babes, 
broads, frails, pigeons, ribs — 
catch on?" 

"Oh, I assume you mean girls. 
There must be, otherwise what 
are the diamonds for?" 

The outward trip took a week, 
but it was spent pleasantly. Dur- 
ing that time, the Miami delega- 
tion cleaned out Chicago, New 
York and Pittsburgh in a klabiash 
game. 

The hop back, for various rea- 
sons, took a little longer. One rea- 
son may have been the condition 
of the crew. On the return the 
boys from Brooklyn were primed 
to the ears with zorkle. 

Zorkle is a Martian medicinal 
distillation, made from the milk 
of the scksnoogle — a six-legged 
cow, seldom milked because few 
Martians can run fast enough to 
catch one. Zorkle is strong enough 
to Hp steel plates out of battle- 
ships, but to stomachs accustomed 
to Lhe stuff sold in Flatbush, it 
acted like a gentle stimulant. 

Upon their safe landing in 
Nevada, the Columbuses of this 
first flight to Mars put in long- 



distance calls to all the other im- 
portant hoods in the country. 

The Crime Cartel met in Cleve- 
land — in the third floor front of 
a tenement on Mayfield Road. 
The purpose of the meeting was to 
"cut up" Mars. 

Considerable dissension arose 
over the bookmaking facilities, 
when it was learned that the radio- 
actlive surface of the planet made 
it unnecessary to send scratches 
and results by wire. On the con- 
trary, the steel-shod hooves of the 
animals set up a current which 
carried into every pool room, 
without a pay-off to the wire 
service. 

The final division found the 
apportionment as follows: 
New York mob: Real 
estate and invest- 
ments (if any) 
Chicago mob: Book- 
making and liquor 
(if any) 

Brooklyn mob: Pro- 
tection and assas- 
sinations 

Jersey mob: Num- 
bers (if any) and 
craps (if any) 
Los A ngeles mob: 
Girls (if any) 
Galveston and New 
Orleans mobs: Dope 
(if any) 

Cleveland mob: Ca- 
sinos (if any) 
Detroit mob: Sum- 
mer resorts (if any)

AMAZING STOKIES 



The Detroit boys, incidentally, 
burned up when they learned the 
Martian year is twice as long as 
ours, consequently it takes two 
years for one summer to roll 
around. 

After the summary demise of 
three Grand Councilors whose 
deaths were recorded by the press 
as occurring from "natural 
causes," the other major and 
minor mobs were declared in as 
partners. 

The first problem to be ironed 
out was how to speed up trans- 
portation ; and failing that, to con- 
struct spacious space ships which 
would attract pleasure-bent trade 
from Terra — Earth to you — 
with such innovations as roulette 
wheels, steam rooms, cocktail 
lounges, double rooms with hot 
and cold babes, and other such 
inducements. 

II 

THE INSIDE STUFF 
CONFIDENTIAL 

Remember, you got this first 
from Lait and Mortimer. And we 
defy anyone to call us liars — and 
prove it! 

Only chumps bring babes with 
them to Mars. The temperature is 
a little colder there than on Earth 
and the air a little thinner. So 
Terra dames complain one mink 
coat doesn't keep them warm; 
they need two. 

On the other hand, the gravity 



is considerably less than on Earth . 
Therefore, even the heaviest 
bim weighs less and can be pushed 
over with the greatest of ease. 

However, the boys soon discov- 
ered that the lighter gravity 
played havoc with the marijuana 
trade. With a slight tensing of 
the muscles you can jump 20 feet, 
so why smoke "tea" when you 
can fly like crazy for nothing? 

Martian women are bags, so 
perhaps you had better disregard 
the injunction above and bring 
your own, even if it means two 
furs. 

Did you ever see an Alaska 
klutch (pronounced klootch)? 
Probably not. Well, these Arctic 
horrors are Ziegfeld beauts com- 
pared to the Martian fair sex. 

They slouch with knees bent 
and knuckles brushing the ground, 
and if Ringling Bros, is looking 
for a mate for Gargantua, here is 
where U> find her. Yel, their man- 
ner is habitually timid, as though 
they've been given a hard time. 
From the look in their deep-set 
eyes they seem to fear abduction 
or rape; but not even the zoot- 
suited goons from Grcenpcrnt 
gave them a second tumble. 

The visiting Mafia delegation 
was naturally disappointed at this 
state of affairs. They had been 
led to believe by the little guy 
who escorted them that all Mar- 
tian dames resembled Marilyn 
Monroe, only more so, and the 
men were Adonises (and not Joe). 



MAKS CONMDENT1AL

Seems they once were, at that. 
This was a couple of aeons ago 
when Earth men looked like Mar- 
tians do now, which seems to 
indicate that Martians, as well as 
Men, have their ups and downs. 

The citizens of the planet are 
apparently about halfway down 
the toboggan. They wear clothes, 
but they're not handstitched. 
Their neckties don't come from 
Sulka. No self-respecting goon 
from Gowanus would care to be 
seen in their company. 

The females always appear in 
public fully clothed, which doesn't 
help them either. But covering 
their faces would. They buy their 
dresses at a place called Kress- 
Worth and look like Paris nou- 
veau riche. 

There are four separate nations 
there, though nation is hardly the 
word. It is more accurate to say 
there are four separate clans that 
don't like each oilier, though how 
they can tell the difference is 
beyond us. They are known as the 
East Side, West Side, North Side 
and Gas House gangs. 

Each stays in its own back- 
yard. Periodic wars are fought, a 
few thousand of the enemy are 
dissolved with ray guns, after 
which the factions retire by com- 
mon consent and throw a banquet 
at which the losing country is 
forced to take the wives of the 
visitors, which is a twist not yet 
thought of on Earth. 

Martian language is unlike 



anything ever heard below. 1 1 
would bafHe the keenest linguist, 
if the keenest linguist ever gets t<> 
Mars. However, the Mafia, which 
is a world-wide blood brotherhood 
with colonies in every land ami 
clime, has a universal language. 
Knives and brass kuueks are 
understood everywhere. 

The Martian lingo seems to be 
somewhat similar to Chinese. It's 
not what they say, but how they 
say It. For instance, psonqule may 
mean "J love you " or " you dirty 
son-of-a-bitch." 

The Mafistas soon learned t<> 
translate what the natives were 
saying by watching the squint in 
their eyes. When they s|x>ke with 
a certain expression, the mobsters 
let go with 45s, which, however, 
merely have a stunning effect on 
the gent on the receiving end 
because of the lesser gravity. 

On the other hand, the Martian 
death ray guns were not fatal to 
the toughs from Earlh; anyone 
who can live through St. Valen- 
tine's Day in Chicago can live 
through anything. So it came out 
a dead heat. 

Thereupon the boys from the 
Syndicate sat down and declared 
the Martians in for a fifty-fifty 
partnership, which means they 
actually gave them one per cent, 
which is generous at that. 

Never having had the great 
advantages of a New Deal, the 
Martians arc still backward and 
use gold as a means of exchange. 



10 



 



With no Harvard bigdomes to tell 
them gold is a thing of the past, 
the yellow metal circulates there 
as freely and easily as we once 
kicked pennies around before 
they became extinct here. 

The Mafistas quickly set the 
Martians right about the futility 
of gold. They eagerly turned it 
over to the Earth men in exchange 
for green certificates with pretty 
pictures engraved thereon. 

Iff 

RACKETS VIA ROCKETS 

Gold, platinum, diamonds and 
other precious stuff are as plenti- 
ful on Mars as hayfever is on 
Earth in August. 

When the gangsters lamped the 
loot, their greedy eyes and greasy 
fingers twitched, and when a 
hood ' s eyes and fingers twitch , 
watch out; something is twitch- 
ing. 

The locals were completely 
honest. They were too dumb to be 
thieves. The natives were not 
acquisitive. Why should they be 
when gold was so common it had 
no value, and a neighbor's wife so 
ugly no one would covet her? 

This was a desperate situation, 
indeed, until one of the boys from 
East St. Louis uttered the eternal 
truth : "There ain't no honest man 
who ain't a crook, and why should 
Mars be any different?" 

The difficulty was finding the 
means and method of corruption. 



All the cash in Jake Guzik's 
strong box meant nothing to a race 
of characters whose brats made 
mud pies of gold dust. 

The discovery came as an acci- 
dent. 

The first Earthman to be elim- 
inated on Mars was a two-bit 
hood from North Clark Street 
who sold a five-cent Hershcy bar 
with almonds to a Martian for a 
gold piece worth 94 bucks. 

The man from Mars bit the 
candy bar. The hood bit the gold 
piece. 

Then the Martian picked up a 
rock and beaned the lad from the 
Windy City. After which the 
Martian's eyes dilated and he let 
out a scream. Then he attacked 
the first Martian female who 
passed by. Never before had such 
a thing happened on Mars, and to 
say she was surprised is putting it 
lightly. Thereupon, half the fe- 
male population ran after the 
berserk Martian. 

When the organization heard 
about this, an investigation was 
ordered. That is how the crime 
trust found out that there is no 
sugar on Mars; that this was the 
first time it had ever been tasted 
by a Martian ; that it acts on them 
like junk does on an Earthman. 

They further discovered that 
the chief source of Martian diet is 
— believe it or not — poppy seed, 
hemp and coca leaf, and that the 
alkaloids thereof : opium, hash- 
heesh and cocaine have not the 



MARS CONFIDENTIAL 



slightest visible effect on them. 

Poppies grow everywhere, huge 
russet poppies, ten times as large 
as those on Earth and 100 times 
as deadly. It is these poppies 
which have colored the planet red. 
Martians are strictly vegetarian: 
they bake, fry and stew these 
flowers and weeds and eat them 
raw with a goo made From fungus 
and called szchmortz which passes 
for a salad dressing. 

Though the Martians were 
absolutely impervious to the nar- 
cotic qualities of the aforemen- 
tioned flora, they got higher than 
Mars on small doses of sugar. 

So the Mafia was in business. 
The Martians sniffed granulated 
sugar, which they called snow. 
They ate cube sugar, which they 
called "hard stuff", and they 
injected molasses syrup into their 
veins with hypos and called this 
"mainliners." 

There was nothing they would 
not do for a pinch of sugar. Gold, 
platinum and diamonds, nar- 
cotics by the acre — these were 
to be had in generous exchange 
for sugar — which was selling on 
Earth at a nickel or so a pound 
wholesale. 

The space ship went into shut- 
tle service. A load of diamonds 
and dope coming back, a load of 
sugar and blondes going up. 
Blondes made Martians higher 
even than sugar, and brought 
larger and quicker returns. 

This is a confidential tip to the 



South African diamond trust: ten 
space ship loads of precious stones 
are now being cut in a cellar on 
Bleecker Street in New York. 
The mob plans to retail them for 
$25 a carat! 

Though the gangsters are buy- 
ing sugar at a few cents a pound 
here and selling it for its weight 
in rubies on Mars, a hood is al- 
ways a hood. They've been cut- 
ting dope with sugar for years on 
Earth, so they didn't know how 
to do it any different on Mars. 
What to cut the sugar with on 
Mars? Simple. With heroin, of 
course, which is worthless there. 

This is a brief rundown on the 
racket situation as it currently 
exists on our sister planet. 

FAKED PASSPORTS: When 
the boys first landed they found 
only vague boundaries between 
the nations, and Martians could 
roam as they pleased. Maybe this 
is why they stayed close to home. 
Though anyway why should they 
travel ? There was nothing to 
see. 

The boys quickly took care of 
this. First, in order to make travel 
alluring, they brought 20 strippers 
from Calumet City and set them 
peeling just beyond the border 
lines. 

Then they went to the chief- 
tains and sold them a bill of 
goods (with a generous bribe of 
sugar) to close the borders. The 
next step was to corrupt the bor- 
der guards, which was easy with 



 



Annie Oakleys to do the burlesque 
shows. 

The selling price for faked pass- 
ports fluctuates between a ton 
and three tons of platinum, 

VICE: Until the arrival of the 
Earth men, there were no illicit 
sexual relations on the planet. In 

fact, no Martian in his right mind 
would have relations with the 
native crop of females, and they 
in turn felt the same way about 
the males. Laws had to be passed 
requiring all able-bodied citizens 
to marry and propagate. 

Thus, the first load of bims 
from South Akard Street in Dallas 
found eager customers. But these 
babes, who romanced anything in 
pants on earth, went on a stand-up 
strike when they saw and smclled 
the Martians. Especially smelled. 
They smelled worse than Texas 
yahoos just off a cow farm. 

This proved embarrassing, to 
say the least, to the procurers. 
Considerable sums of money were 
invested in this human cargo, and 
the boys feared dire consequences 
from their shylocks, should they 
return empty-handed. 

In our other Confidential essays 
we told you how the Mafia em- 
ploys some of the best brains on 
Earth to direct and manage its 
far-flung properties, including 
high-priced attorneys, account- 
ants, real-estate experts, engi- 
neers and scientists. 

A hurried meeting of the Grand 
Council was called and held in a 



bungalow on the shores of one of 
Minneapolis' beautiful lakes. The 
decision reached there was to cor- 
ner chlorophyl (which accounts in 
part for the delay in putting it on 
the market down here) and ship it 
to Mars to deodorize the populace 
there. After which the ladies of 
the evening got off their feet and 
went back to work. 

GAMBLING: Until the arrival 
of the Mafia, gambling on Mars 
was confined to a simple game 
played with children's jacks. The 
loser had to relieve the winner of 
his wife. 

The Mafia brought up some 
«fine gambling equipment, includ- 
ing the layouts from the Colonial 
Inn in Florida, and the Beverly in 
New Orelans, both of which were 
closed, and taught the residents 
how to shoot craps and play the 
wheel, with the house putting up 
sugar against precious stones and 
metals. With such odds, it was 
not necessary to fake the games 
more than is customary on Earth.

LITTLE NEW YORK 
CONFIDENTIAL 

Despite what Earth-bound pro- 
fessors tell you about the Martian 
atmosphere, we know better. They 
weren't there. 

It is a dogma that Mars has no 
oxygen. Baloney. While it is true 
that there is considerably less 
than on Earth in the surface at- 



MARS CONFIDENTIAL 



13 



mosphere, the air underground, m 
caves, valleys and tunnels, has 
plenty to support life lavishly, 
though why Martians want lo live 
after they look at each other we 
cannot tell you, even confidential. 

For this reason Martian cities 
are built underground, and travel 
between them is carried on through 
a complicated system of subways 
predating the New York I RT line 
by several thousand centuries, 
though to the naked eye there is 
little difference between a Brook- 
lyn express and a Mars express, 
yet the latter were built before 
the Pyramids. 

When the first load of Black 
Handers arrived, they naturally 
balked against living underground. 
It reminded them too much of the 
days before they went "legiti- 
mate" and were constantly on the 
lam and hiding out. 

So the Mafia put the Martians 
to work building a town. There 
are no building materials on the 
planet, but the Martians are 
adept at making gold dust hold 
together with diamond rivets. The 
result of their effort — for which 
they were paid in peppermint 
sticks and lump sugar — is named 
Little New York, with hotels, 
nightclubs, bars, haberdashers, 
Turkish baths and horse rooms. 
Instead of air-conditioning, it had 
oxygen-conditioning. But the town 
had no police station. 

There were no cops! 

Finally, a meeting was held at 



which one punk asked another, 
"What the hell kind of town is it 
with no cops? Who we going to 
bribe?" 

After some discussion they cut 
cards. One of the Bergen County 
boys drew the black ace. "What 
do I know about being a cop?" he 
squawked. 

' ' You ca n ta ke graft , ca n ' t 
you? You been shook down, ain't 
you?" 

The boys also imported a cou- 
ple of smart mouthpieces and a 
ship of blank habeas corpus Tortus, 
together with a judge who was the 
brother of one of the lawyers, so 
there was no need to build a jail 
in this model city. 

The only ones who ever get 
arrested, anyway, are the Mar- 
tians, and they soon discovered 
that the coppers from Terra would 
look the other way for a bucket 
full of gold. 

Until the arrival of the Earth- 
men, the Martians were, as stated, 
peaceful, and even now crime is 
practically unknown among them, 
The chief problem, however, is to 
keep them in line on pay nights, 
when they go on sugar binges. 

Chocolate bars are as common 
on Mars as saloons are on Broad- 
way, and it is not unusual to see 
"gone" Martians getting heaved 
out of these bars right into the 
gutter. One nostalgic hood from 
Seattle said it reminded him of 
Skid Row there.

AMAZING STORIKS 



V 

THE RED RED PLANET 

The gangsters h at i noJ; Det;n on 
Mars long before they heard ru- 
mors about other outsiders who 
were supposed to have landed on 
the other side of Ml. Sirehunz. 

The boys got together in a cock- 
tail lounge to talk this over, and 
they decided they weren't going 
to stand for any other mobs mus- 
cling in. 

Thereupon, they despatched 
four torpedoes with Tommy guns 
in a big black limousine to see 
what was going. 

We tell you this Confidential. 
What they found was a Commu- 
nist apparatus sent to Mars from 
Soviet Russia. 

This cell was so active that 
Commies had taken over almost 
half the planet before the arrival 
of the Mafia, with their domain 
extending from the Deucalionis 
Region all the way over to Pka- 
ethvntis and down to Titania. 

Furthermore, through propa- 
ganda and infiltration, there were 
Communist cells in every quarter 
of the planet, and many of the 
top officials of the four Martian 
governments were either secretly 
party members or openly in fronts. 

The Communist battle cry was: 
"Men of Mars unite; you have 
nothing to lose but your wives." 

Comes the revolution, they 
were told, and all Martians could 
remain bachelors. It is no wonder 



the Communists made such in- 
roads. The planet became known 
as "The Red Planet." 

In their confidential books about 
the cities of Earth, Lait and Mor- 
timer explored the community of 
interest between the organized 
underworld and the Soviet. 

Communists are in favor of 
anything that causes civil disorder 
and unrest ; gangsters have no 
conscience and will do business 
with anyone who pays. 

On Earth, Russia floods the 
Western powers, and especially 
the United States, with narcotics, 
first to weaken them and provide 
easy prey, and second, for dollar 
exchange. 

And on Earth, the Mafia, which 
is another international conspir- 
acy like the Communists, sells the 
narcotics. 




MARS CONFIDENTIAL

And so when the gangsters 
heard there were Communist cells 
on Mars, they quickly made a 
contact. 

For most of the world's cheap 
sugar comes from Russia! The 
Mafia inroad on the American 
sugar market had already driven 
cane up more than 300 per cent. 
But the Russians were anxious, 
able and willing to provide all the 
beets they wanted at half the com- 
petitive price. 

VI 

THE HONEST HOODS 

■ As we pointed out in previous 
works, the crime syndicate now 
owns so much money, its chief 
problem is to find ways in which 
to invest it. 

As a result, the Mafia and its 
allies control thousands of legiti- 
mate enterprises ranging from ho- 



tel chains to railroads and from 
laundries to distilleries. 

And so it was on Mars. With all 
the rackets cornered, the gang- 
sters decided it was time to go 
into some straight businesses. 

At the next get-together of the 
Grand Council, the following con- 
versation was heard : 

"What do these mopes need 
that they ain't getting?" 

"A big fat hole in the head." 

"Cut it out. This is serious." 

"A hole in the head ain't seri- 
ous?" 

"There's no profit in them one- 
shot deals." 

"It's the repeat business you 
make the dough on." 

" Maybe you got something 
there. You can kill a jerk only 
once." 

"But a jerk can have rela- 
tives." 

"We're talking about legit stuff. 



16 



 



All the rest has been taken rare 
of." 

''With the Martians I've seen, 
a bar of soap could be a big 
thing." 

From this random suggestion, 
there sprang up a major inter- 
planetary project. If the big soap 
companies are wondering where 
all that soap went a few years ago, 
we can tell them. 

It went to Mars. 
' Soap caught on immediately. 
It was snapped up as fast as it ar- 
rived. 

But several questions popptid 
into the minds of the Mafia soap 
salesman. 

Where was it all going? A 
Martian, in line for a bar in the 
evening, was back again the fol- 
lowing morning for another one. 

And why did the Martians stay 
just as dirty as ever? 

The answer was, the Martians 



stayed as dirty as ever because 
they weren't using the soap to 
wash with. They were eating it! 

1 1 cured the hangover from 
sugar. 

Another group cornered the un- 
dertaking business, adding a twist 
that made for more activity. They 
added a Department of Elimina- 
tion. The men in charge of this 
end of the business circulate 
through the chocolate and soap 
bars, politely inquiring, "Who 
would you like killed?" 

Struck with the novelty of the 
thing, quite a few Martians re- 
member other Martians they are 
mad at. The going price is one 
hundred carats of diamonds to 
kill; which is cheap considering 
the average laborer earns 10,000 
carats a week. 

Then the boys from the more 
dignified end of the business drop 
tn at the home of the victim and 



MARS CONFIDENTIAL 



17 



offer to bury him cheap. Two hun- 
dred and fifty carats gets a Mar- 
tian planted in style. 

Inasmuch as Martians live un- 
derground, burying is done in 
reverse, by tying a rocket to the 
tail of the deceased and shooting 
him out into the stratosphere.

NIQHTMARE 



You've heard, of course, the theory that an enemy can hide atom bombs 
in our cities, then call on us to surrender or be blcnvn to bits. Say such 
bombs were planted; what could we do about it? Find them before they 
explode? How? No mechanical means exist to do the job, nor can 
every building in forty cities be searched in, say, two hours. Since 
Americans don't quit under any circumstances, what's the answer? 

Robert Heinlein, Mr. Science Fiction himself, has taken this same 
situation and woven it into aw exciting hunk of melodrama. While his 
solution to the problem is unique and ingenious, it is solidly based 
on a phenomenon most of us have run across at one time or another. 



Anybody want a side bet on double deuces?" 
No one answered; the old soldier rattled dice in a glass, 
pitched them against the washroom wall. One turned up a 
deuce; the other spun. Somebody yelled, "It's going to 
five! Come, Phoebe!" 

It stopped — a two. The old soldier said, " I told you not 
to play with me. Anybody want cigarette money?" 
"Pick it up. Pop. We don't — oh, oh! 'Tcnshun!" 
In the door stood a civilian, a colonel, and a captain. The

civilian said, "Give the money 
back, Two-Gun." 

"Okay, Prof." The old soldier 
extracted two singles. "That 
much is mine." 

"Stop!" objected the captain. 
"I'll impound that for evidence. 
Now, you men — " • 

The colonel stopped him. 
"Mick. Forget that you're ad- 
jutant. Private Andrews, come 
along." He went out; the others 
followed. They hurried through 
the enlisted men's club, out into 
<lesert sunshine and across the 
<juadrangle. 

The civilian said, "Two-Gun, 
■what the deuce!" 

"Shucks, Prof, I was just prac- 
ticing." 

"Why don't you practice against 
Ocandma Wilkins?" 

The soldier snorted. " Do I look 
silly?" 

The colonel put in, "You're 
keeping a crowd of generals and 
"V.I.P.s waiting. That isn't bright." 

"Colonel Hammond, I was told 
to wait in the club." 

"But not in its washroom. 
Step it up!" 

They went inside headquarters 
to a hall where guards checked 
their passes before letting them 
in. A civilian was speaking: 
"—and that's the story of the 
history-making experiments at 
Duke University. Doctor Reyn- 
olds is back; he will conduct the 
demonstrations. " 

The officers sat down in the 



rear; Dr. Reynolds went to the 
speaker's table. Private Andrews 
sat down with a group set apart 
from the high brass and distin- 
guished civilians of the audience. 
A character who looked like a 
professional gambler — -and was 
■ — sat next to two beautiful red- 
heads, identical twins. A four- 
teen-year-old Negro boy slumped 
in the next chair; he seemed 
asleep. Beyond him a most wide- 
awake person, Mrs. Anna Wil- 
kins, tatted and looked around. 
In the second row were college 
students and a drab middle-aged 
man. 

The table held a chuck-a-luck 
cage, packs of cards, scratch pads, 
a Geiger counter, a lead carrying 
case. Reynolds leaned on it and 
said, "Extra-Sensory Perception, 
or E.S.P., is a tag for little-known 
phenomena — telepathy, clair- 
voyance, clairaudience, precogni- 
tion, telekinesis. They exist; we 
can measure them; we know that 
some people are thus gifted. But 
we don't know how they work. 
The British, in India during 
World War One, found that se- 
crets were being stolen by telep- 
athy." Seeing doubt in their faces 
Reynolds added, "It is conceiva- 
ble that a spy five hundred miles 
away is now 'listening in' — and 
picking your brains of top-secret 
data." 

Doubt was more evident. A 
four-star Air Force general said, 



22 



 



"One moment, Doctor — if true, 
what can we do to stop it?" 
" Nothing." 

"That's no answer. A lead- 
lined room ? " 

"We've tried that, General. No 
effect." 

"Jamming with high frequen- 
cies ; J Or whatever 'brain waves' 
are?" 

"Possibly, though I doubt it. 
If E.S.P. becomes militarily im- 
portant you may have to operate 
with all facts known. Back to our 
program: These ladies and gentle- 
men are powerfully gifted in tele- 
kinesis, the ability to control mat- 
ter at a distance. Tomorrow's ex- 
periment may not succeed, but 
wc hope to convince the doubting 
Thomases" — he smiled at a man 
in the rear — "that it is worth 
trying." 

The man he looked at stood up. 
"General Hanby!" 

An Army major general looked 
around. "Yes, Doctor Withers?" 

"I ask to be excused. My desk 
is loaded with urgent work — 
and these games have nothing to 
do with me." 

The commanding general started 
to assert himself; the four-star 
visitor put a hand on his sleeve. 
" Doctor Withers, my desk in 
Washington is piled high, but I 
am here because the President 
sent me. Will you please stay? 
I want a skeptical check on my 
judgment." 

Withers sat down, still angry. 



Reynolds continued : "We will 
start with E.S.P. rather than tele- 
kinesis — which is a bit different, 
anyhow." He turned to one of 
the redheads. "Jane, will you 
o i me here? " 

The girl answered, "I'm Joan. 
Sure." 

"All right — Joan. General La- 
Mott, will you draw something on 
this scratch pad?" 

The four-star flyer cocked an 
eyebrow. "Anything?" 

"Not too complicated." 

"Right, Doctor." He thought, 
then began a cartoon of a girl, 
grinned and added a pop-eyed 
wolf. Shortly he looked up. 
"Okay?" 

Joan had kept busy with an- 
other pad; Reynolds took hers to 
the general. The sketches were 
alike — ■ except that Joan had 
added four stars to the wolf's 
shoulders. The general looked at 
her; she looked demure. " I'm 
convinced," he said drily. "What 
next?" 

"That could be clairvoyance 
or telepathy," Reynolds lectured. 
"We will now show direct telep- 
athy." He called the second twin 
to him, then said, "Doctor With- 
ers, will you help us?" 

Withers still looked surly. 
"With what?" 

"The same thing — but Jane 
will watch over your shoulder 
while Joan tries to reproduce 
what you draw. Make it some- 
thing harder." 



PROJECT NIGHTMARE

"Well . . . okay." He took t he 
pad, began sketching a radio cir- 
cuit while Jane watched. He 
signed it with a "Clem", the 
radioman's cartoon of the little 
fellow peering over a fence. 

"That's fine!" said Reynolds. 
''Finished, Joan?" 

"Yes, Doctor." He fetched her 
pad; the diagram was correct — 
but Joan had added to "Clem" 
a wink. 

Reynolds interrupted awed 
comment with, "I will skip card 
demonstrations and turn to tele- 
kinesis. "Has anyone a pair of 
dice? " No one volunteered ; he 
went on, "We have some supplied 
by your physics department. This 
chuck-a-luck cage is signed and 
sealed by them and so is this 
package." He broke it open, 
spilled out a dozen dice. "Two- 
Gun, how about some naturals?" 

"I'll try, Prof." 

"General LaMott, please select 
a pair and put them in this cup." 

The general com pi ied and 
handed the cup to Andrews. 
"What are you going to roll, 
soldier? " 

"Would a sixty-five suit the 
General?" 

" If you can." 

"Would the General care to 
put up a five spot, to make it in- 
teresting?" He waited, wide-eyed 
and innocent. 

La Mott grinned. "You're 
faded, soldier." He peeled out a 



five; Andrews covered it, rat- 
tled the cup and rolled. One die 
stopped on the bills — a five. 
The other bounced against a chair 
— a six. 

"Let it ride, sir?" 

"I'm not a sucker twice. Show 
us some naturals." 

"As you say, sir." Two-Gun 
picked up the money, then rolled 
6—1, 5-2, 4-3, and back again. 
He mlled several 6-ls, then got 
snake eyes. He tried again, got 
acey-deucey. He faced the little 
old lady. "Ma'am," he said, "if 
you want to roll, why don't you 
get down here and do the work?" 

"Why, Mr. Andrews!" 

Reynolds said hastily, "You'll 
get your turn, Mrs. Wilkins." 

" I don't know what you gentle- 
men are talking about." She re- 
sumed tatting. 

Colonel Hammond sat down by 
the redheads. "You're the Janu- 
ary Twins — aren't you?" 

"Our public!" one answered 
delightedly. 

"The name is 'Brown'," said 
the other. 

"'Brown'," heagreed, "but how 
about a show for the boys?" 

"Dr. Reynolds wouldn't like 
it," the first said dutifully. 

"I'll handle him. We don't get 
USO; security regulations are 
too strict. How about it, Joan?" 

"I'm Jane. Okay, if you fix it 
with Prof." 

"Good girls!" He went back to 
where Grandma Wilkins was dem- 



24 



 



onstrating selection — showers of 
sixes in the chuck-a-luck cage. 
She was still tatting. Dr. Withers 
watched glumly. Hammond said, 
"Well, Doc?" 

"These things are disturbing," 
Withers admitted, "but it's on 
the molar level — nothing affect- 
ing the elementary particles." 

"How about those sketches?" 

"I'm a physicist, not a psy- 
chologist. But the basic particles 
— electrons, neutrons, protons — 
can't be affected except with ap- 
paratus designed in accordance 
with the laws of radioactivity!" 

Dr. Reynolds was in earshot; at 
Withers' remark he said, "Thank 
you, Mrs. Wilkins. Now, ladies 
and gentlemen, another experi- 
ment. Norman!" 

The colored boy opened his 
eyes. "Yeah, Prof?" 

"Up here. And the team from 
your physics laboratory, please. 
Has anyone a radium - dial 
watch?" 

Staff technicians hooked the 
Geiger counter through an am- 
plifier so that normal background 
radioactivity was heard as oc- 
casional clicks, then placed a 
radium-dial watch close to the 
counter tube; the clicks changed 
to hail-storm volume. "Lights 
out, please," directed Reynolds. 

The boy said, "Now, Prof?" 

"Wait, Norman. Can everyone 
see the watch?" The silence was 
broken only by the rattle of the 
amplifier, counting radioactivity 



of the glowing figures. "Now, 
Norman ! " 

The shining figures quenched 
out; the noise died to sparse clicks. 

The same group was in a block- 
house miles out in the desert; 
more miles beyond was the bomb 
proving site; facing it was a peri- 
scope window set in concrete and 
glazed with solid feet of laminated 
filter glass. Dr. Reynolds was talk- 
ing with Major General Hanby. 
A naval captain took reports via 
earphones and speaker horn; he 
turned to the CO. "Planes on 
station, sir." 

"Thanks, Dick." 

The horn growled, ' ' Station 
Charlie to Control; we fixed it." 

The navy man said to Hanby, 
"All stations ready, range clear." 

"Pick up the count." 

"All stations, stand by to re- 
sume count at minus seventeen 
minutes. Time station, pick up 
the count. This is a live run. 
Repeat, this is a live run." 

Hanby said to Reynolds, " Dis- 
tance makes no difference?" 

"We could work from Salt Lake 
City once my colleagues knew the 
setup." lie glanced down. "My 
watch must have stopped." 

"Always feels that way. Re- 
member the metronome on the 
first Bikini test? It nearly drove 
me nuts." 

" I can imagine. Um, General, 
some of my people are high-strung. 
Suppose I ad lib?" 

Hanby smiled grimly. "We al- 



PROJECT NIGHTMARE 



ways have a pacifier for visitors. 
Doctor Withers, ready with your 
curtain raiser? " 

The chief physicist was bending 
over a group at instruments; he 
looked tired. "Not today," he 
answered in a flat voice. "Sat- 
terlee will make it." 

Satterlee came forward and 
grinned at the brass and V.t.P.s 
and at Reynolds' operators. "I've 
been saving a joke for an audience 
that can't walk out. But first — " 
He picked up a polished metal 
sphere and looked at the E.S.P. 
adepts. "You saw a ball like this 
on your tour this morning. That 
one was plutonium; it's still out 
there waiting to go bang! in about 
. . . eleven minutes. This is merely 
steel — unless someone has made 
a mistake. That would be a joke 
— we'd laugh ourselves to bits!" 

He got no laugh, went on; "But 
it doesn't weigh enough ; we're 
safe. This dummy has been pre- 
pared so that Dr. Reynolds' peo- 
ple will have an image to help 
them concentrate. It looks no 
more like an atom bomb than 1 
look like Stalin, but it represents 
- — if it were plutonium — -what 
we- atom tinkerers call a 'sub- 
-critical mass'. Since the spy trials 
everybody knows how an atom 
bomb works. Plutonium gives off 
neutrons at a constant rate. If 
the mass is small, most of them 
escape to the outside. But if it is 
large enough, or a critical mass, 
enough are absorbed by other 



nuclei to start a chain reaction. 
The trick is to assemble a critical 
mass quickly — then run for your 
life! This happens in microsec- 
onds; I can't be specific without 
upsetting the security officer. 

"Today we will find out if the 
mind can change the rate of neu- 
tron emission in plutonium. By 
theories sound enough to have 
destroyed two Japanese cities, the 
emission of any particular neu- 
tron is pure chance, but the total 
emission is as invariable as the 
stars in their courses. Otherwise 
it would be impossible to make 
a tom bombs. 

"By standard theory, theory 
that works, that subcritical mass 
out there is no more likely to 
explode than a pumpkin. Our test 
group will try to change that. 
They will concentrate, try to in- 
crease the probability of neutrons' 
escaping, and thus set off that 
sphere as an atom bomb." 

"Doctor Satterlee?" asked a 
vice admiral with wings. "Do you 
think it can be done?" 

''Absolutely not!" Satterlee 
turned to the adepts. " No offense 
intended, folks." 

" Five minutes! " announced the 
navy captain. 

Satterlee nodded to Reynolds. 
"Take over. And good luck." 

Mrs. Wilkins spoke up. "Just 
a moment, young man. These 
'neuter' things. I—" 

"Neutrons, madam." 



26 



 



"That's what I said. I don't 
quite understand. I suppose that 
sort of thing comes in high school, 
but 1 only finished eighth grade. 
I'm sorry." 

Satterlee looked sorry, too, but 
he tried. " — and each of these 
nuclei is potentially able to spit 
out one of these little neutrons. 
In that sphere out there" — he 
held up the dummy — "there are, 
say, five thousand billion trillion 
nuclei, each one — " 

"My, that's quite a lot, isn't 
it?" 

"Madam, it certainly is. 
Now — " 

" Two minutes!" 

Reynolds interrupted. " Mrs. 
Wilkins, don't worry. Concen- 
trate on that metal ball out there 
ami think about those neutrons, 
each one ready to come out. When 
I give the word, I want you all — 
you especially, Norman — to 
think about that ball, spitting 
sparks like a watch dial. Try for 
more sparks. Simply try. If you 
fail, no one will blame you. Don't 
get tense." 

Mrs. Wilkins nodded. " I'll 
try." She put her tatting down 
and got a faraway look. 

At once they were blinded by 
unbelievable radiance bursting 
through the massive filter. It beat 
on them, then died away. 

The naval captain said, "What 
the hell!" Someone screamed, 
" It's gone, it's gone!" 

The speaker brayed: "Fission 



at minus one minute thirty-seven 
seconds. Control, what went 
wrong. It looks like a hydro- 
gen — " 

The concussion wave hit and 
all sounds were smothered. Lights 
went out, emergency lighting 
clicked on. The blockhouse heaved 
like a boat in a heavy sea. Their 
eyes were still dazzled, their ears 
assaulted by cannonading after- 
noise, and physicists were elbow- 
ing flag officers at the port, when 
an anguished soprano cut through 
the din. "Oh, dear.' " 

Reynolds snapped, "What's the 
matter, Grandma? You all right?" 

"Me? Oh, yes, yes - but I'm 
so sorry. I didn't mean to do it." 

" Do what? " 

" I was just feeling it out, think- 
ing about all those little bitty 
neuters, ready to spit. But I 
didn't mean to make it go off — 
not till you told us to." 

"Oh." Reynolds turned to the 
rest. ' ' Anyone el se jump the 
gun?" 

No one admitted it. Mrs. Wil- 
kins said timidly, "I'm sorry, 
Doctor. Have they got another 
one? I'll be more careful." 

. Reynolds and Withers were 
seated in the officers' mess with 
coffee in front of them ; the phys- 
icist paid no attention to his. 
His eyes glittered and his face 
twitched. "No limits ! Calcula- 
tions show over ninety per cent 
conversion of mass to energy. 



I'ROJICCT NIGHTMARE

You know what that means? If 
we assume — no, never mind. 
Just say that we could make 
every bomb the size of a pea. 
No tamper. No control circuits. 
Nothing but ..." He paused. 
"Delivery would be fast, small 
jets — just a pilot, a weaponeer, 
and one of your 'operators'. No 
limit to the number of bombs. No 
nation on earth could — " 

"Take it easy," said Reynolds. 
"We've got only a few telekinesis 
operators. You wouldn't risk them 
in a plane." 

"But—" 

"You don't need to. Show them 
the bombs, give them photos of 
the targets, hook them by radio 
to the weaponeer. That spreads 
them thin. And we'll test for more 
sensitive people. My figures show 
about one in eighteen hundred." 

"'Spread them thin'," repeated 
Withers. "Mrs. Wilkins could 
handle dozens of bombs, one after 
another — couldn't she? " 

" I suppose so. We'll test." 

"We will indeed!" Withers no- 
ticed his coffee, gulped it. "For- 
give me, Doctor; I'm punchy. 
I've had to revise too many 
opinions." 

" I know. I was a behaviorist." 

Captain Mikelef came in, 
looked around and came over. 
"The General wants you both," 
he said softly. "Hurry." 

They were ushered into a 
guarded office. Major General 
Hanby was with General LaMott 



and Vice Admiral Keithley; they 
looked grim. Hanby handed them 
message flimsies. Reynolds saw 
the stamp TOP SECRET and 
handed his back. "General, I'm 
not cleared for this." 

"Shut up and read it." 

Reynolds skipped the number 
groups: " — (PARAPHRASED) 
RUSSIAN EMBASSY TODAY

VERT TO 'PEOPLE'S REPUB-

ARATE) ARE MINED WITH

Reynolds reread it — "SIX- 
TEEN HUNDRED FRIDAY" 
— two o'clock tomorrow after- 
noon, local time. Our cities booby- 
trapped with A-bombs? Could 
they do that? He realized that 
LaMott was speaking. "We must 
assume that the threat is real. 
Our free organ ization makes i t 
an obvious line of attack." 

The admiral said, "They may 
be bluffing." 

The air general shook his head. 
"They know the President won't 
surrender. We can't assume that 
Ivan is stupid." 



28 



 



Reynolds wondered why he was 
being allowed to hear this. La- 
Mott looked at him. "Admiral 
Keithley and I leave for Wash- 
ington at once. I have delayed to 
ask you this: your people set off 
an atom bomb. Can they keep 
bombs from going off?" 

Reynolds felt his time sense 
stretch as if he had all year to 
think about Grandma Wilkins, 
Norman, his othec paranornials. 
"Yes," he answered. 

LaMott stood up. "Your job, 
Hanby. Coming, Admiral?" 

"Wait!" protested Reynolds. 
"Give me one bomb and Mrs. 
Wilkins — and I'll sit on it. But 
how many cities? Twenty? 
Thirty?" 

"Thirty-eight." 

"Thirty-eight bombs — or 
more. Where are they? What do 
they look like? How long will this 
go on? It's impossible." 

"Of course — but do it any- 
how. Or try. Hanby, tell them 
we're on our way, will you?" 

"Certainly, General." 

"Good-by, Doctor. Or so long, 
rather." 

Reynolds suddenly realized that 
these two were going back to 
"sit" on one of the bombs, to 
continue their duties until it 
killed them. He said quickly, 
"We'll try. We'll certainly try." 

Thirty-eight cities . . . forty- 
three hours . . . and seventeen 
adepts. Others were listed in 



years of research, but they wera 
scattered through forty-one states. 
In a dictatorship secret police 
would locate them at once, deliver 
them at supersonic speeds. But 
this was America. 

Find them! Get them here! 
Fast! Hanby assigned Colonel 
Hammond to turn Reynolds' 
wishes into orders and directed 
his security officer to delegate his 
duties, get on the ph*one and use 
his acquaintance with the F.B.I., 
with other security officers, and 
through them with local police, 
to cut red tape and find those 
paranornials. Find them, convince 
them, bring pressure, start them 
winging toward the proving 
ground. By sundown, twenty- 
three had been found, eleven had 
been convinced or coerced, two 
had arrived. Hanby phoned Reyn- 
olds, caught him eating a sand- 
wich standing up. "Hanby speak- 
ing. The President just phoned." 

"The President?" 

"LaMott got in to see him. 
He's dubious, but he's authorized 
an all-out try, short of slowing 
down conventional defense. One 
of his assistants left National 
Airport by jet plane half an hour 
ago to come here and help. Things 
will move faster." 

But it did not speed things up, 
as the Russian broadcast was 
even then being beamed, making 
the crisis public ; the President 
went on the air thirty minutes 
later. Reynolds did not hear him;

he was busy. Twenty people to 
save twenty cities — and a world. 
But how? He was sure that Mrs. 
Wilkins could smother any A- 
bomb she had seen; he hoped the 
others could. But a hidden bomb 
in a far-off city — find it mentally, 
think about it, quench it, not for 
the microsecond it took to set one 
off, but for the billions of micro- 
seconds it might take to uncover 
it — was it possible? 

What would help? Certain 
drugs — caffeine, benzedrine. 
They must have quiet, too. He 
turned to Hammond, "t want a 
room and bath for each one." 

"You've got that." 

"No, we're doubled up, with 
semi-private baths." 

Hammond shrugged. "Can do. 
It means booting out some brass." 

" Keep the kitchen manned. 
They must not sleep, but they'll 
have to eat. Fresh coffee all the 
time and cokes and tea — any- 
thing they want. Can you put the 
room phones through a private 
switchboard?" 

"Okay. What else?" 

"I don't know. We'll talk to 
them." 

They all knew of the Russian 
broadcast, but not what was being 
planned; they met his words with 
uneasy silence. Reynolds turned 
to Andrews. "Well, Two-Gun?" 

"Big bite to chew, Prof." 

"Yes. Can you chew it?" 

"Have to, I reckon." 

"Norman?" 



"Gee, Boss! How can I when I 
ciin'i see 'em?" 

" Mrs. Wilkins couldn't see thai 
bomb this morning. You can't 
see radioactivity on a watch dial; 
it's too small. You just see the 
dial and think about it. Well?" 

The Negro lad scowled. " Think 
of a shiny ball in a city some- 
where?" 

"Yes. No, wait — Colonel 
Hammond, they need a visual 
image and it won't be that. There 
are atom bombs here — they must 
see one." 

Hammond frowned. "An Amer- 
ican bomb meant for dropping or 
firing won't look like a Russian 
bomb rigged for placement and 
radio triggering." 

"What will they look like?" 

"G-2 ought to know. 1 hope. 
We'll get some sort of picture, 
A three-dimensional mock-up, 
too. I'd better find Withers and 
the General." He left. 

Mrs. Wilkins said briskly, 
"Doctor, I'll watch Washington, 
D. C> 

"Yes, Mrs. Wilkins. You're 
the only one who has been tested, 
even in reverse. So you guard 
Washington ; it's of prime im- 
portance." 

"No, no, that's not why. It's 
the city I can see best." 

Andrews said, "She's got some- 
thing, Prof. I pick Seattle." 

By midnight Reynolds had his 
charges," twenty-six by now,

AMAZING STOKIES 



tucked away in the officers' club. 
Hammond and he took turns at 
a switchboard rigged in the upper 
hall. The watch would not start 
until shortly before deadline. Fa- 
tigue reduced paranormal powers, 
sometimes to zero; Reynolds 
hoped that they were getting one 
last night of sleep. 

A microphone had been in- 
stalled in each room; a selector 
switch let them listen in. Reyn- 
olds disliked this but Hammond 
argued, "Sure, it's an invasion of 
privacy. So is being blown up by 
an A-bomb." He dialed the switch. 
"Hear that? Our boy Norman is 
sawing wood." He moved it again. 
"Private 'Two-Gun' is still stir- 
ring. We can't let them sleep, 
once it starts, so we have to spy 
on them." 

" 1 suppose so." 

Withers came upstairs. "Any- 
thing more you need?" 

"I guess not," answered Reyn- 
olds. "How about the bomb 
mock-up? " 

"Before morning," 

"How authentic is it?" 

" Hard to say. Their agents 
probably rigged firing circuits 
from radio parts bought right 
here; the circuits could vary a lot. 
But the business part — well, 
we're using real plutonium." 

"Good. We'll show it to them 
after breakfast." 

Two-Gun's door opened. 
" Howdy, Colonel. Prof — it's 
there." 




PROJECT NIGHTMARE

"What is?" 

"The bomb. Under Seattle. I 
can feel it." 

" Where is it? " 

"It's down — it feels down. 
And it feels wet, somehow. Would 
they put it in the Sound?" 

Hammond jumped up. "In the 
harbor — and shower the city 
with radioactive water!" He was 
ringing as he spoke. ' ' Get me Gen- 
eral Hanby ! " 

" Morrison here," a voice an- 
swered. "What is it, Hammond?" 

"The Seattle bomb — have 
them dredge for it. It's in the 
Sound, or somewhere under wa- 
ter." 

"Eh? How do you know?" 

''One of Reynolds' magicians. 
Do it!" He cut off. 

Andrews said worriedly, "Prof, 
I can't see it -I'm not a 'seeing- 
eye. ' Why don ' t you get one ? 
Say that little Mrs. Brentano?" 

"Oh, my God! Clairvoyants — 
we need them, too." 

Withers said, "Eh, Doctor? Do 
you think — " 

"No, I don't, or I would have 
thought of it. How do they search 
for bombs? What instruments?" 

"Instruments? A bomb in its 
shielding doesn't even affect a 
Ge'iger counter. You have to open 
things and look." 

"How long will that take? Say 
for New York!" 

Hammond said, "Shut up! 
Reynolds, where are these clair- 
voyants?" 



Reynolds chewed his lip. 
"They're scarce." 

"Scarcer than us dice rollers," 
added Two-Gun. "But get that 
Brentano kid. She found keys 1 
had lost digging a ditch. Buried 
three feet deep — and me search- 
ing my quarters." 

"Yes, yes, Mrs. Brentano." 
Reynolds pulled out a notebook. 

Hammond reached for the 
switchboard. "Morrison? Stand 
by for more names and even 
more urgent than the others." 

More urgent but harder to 
find; the Panic was on. The Presi- 
dent urged everyone to keep cool 
and stay home, whereupon thirty 
million people stampeded. The 
ticker in the P.I.O. office typed 
the story: "NEW YORK NY —

NOT KNOWN. MORE MORE 
MORE— FLASH— " 

It was repeated everywhere. 
The Denver- Colorado Springs 
highway had one hundred thirty- 
five deaths by midnight, then 
reports stopped. A DC-6 at Bur- 
bank ploughed into a mob which 
had broken through the barrier, 
Tlx- Baltimore-Washington high- 
way was dogged • both ways; 
Memorial Bridge was out of serv- 
ice. The five outlets from Los An- 
geles were solid with creeping 
cars, At four a.m. EST the Presi- 
dent declared martial law; the 
order had no immediate effect. 

By morning Reynolds had 
thirty-one adepts assigned to 
twenty-four cities. He had a 
stomach-churning ordeal before 
deciding to let them work only 
cities known to them. The gam- 
bler, Even-Money Karsch, had 
settled it: "Doc, I know when 
I'm hot. Minneapolis luis to be 
mine." Reynolds gave in, even 
though one of his students had 
just arrived from there; he put 
them both on it and prayed that 
at least one would be " hot". 
Two clairvoyants arrived ; one, 
a blind newsdealer from Chicago, 
was put to searching there; the 
other, a camie mcntalist, was 
given the list and told to find 
bombs wherever she could. Mrs. 
Brentano had remarried and 
moved ; Norfolk was being combed 
for her. 

At one fifteen p.m., forty-five 



minutes before deadline, they 
were in their rooms, each with 
maps and aerial views of his city, 
each with photos of the mocked - 
u p bomb. The club was clear of 
residents; the few normals needed 
to coddle the paranormals kept 
careful quiet. Roads nearby were 
blocked; air traffic was warned 
away. Everything was turned to- 
ward providing an atmosphere in 
which forty-two people could sit 
still and think. 

At the switchboard were Ham- 
mond , Reynolds, and Gordon 
McClintock, the President's as- 
sistant. Reynolds glanced up. 
"What time is it?" 

"One thirty-seven,'* rasped 
Hammond. "Twenty-three min- 
utes." 

"One thirty-eight," disagreed 
McClintock. " Reynolds, how 
about Detroit? You can't leave it 
unguarded." 

"Whom can I tise? Each is 
guarding the city he knows best." 

"Those twin girls — I heard 
them mention Detroit." 

"They've played everywhere. 
But Pittsburgh is their home." 

"Switch one of them to De- 
troit." 

Reynolds thought of telling 
him to go to Detroit himself. 
"They work together. You want 
to get them upset and lose both 
cities?" 

Instead of answering McClin- 
tock said, "And who's watching 
Cleveland?" 



PROJECT NIGHTMARE 



33 



"Norman Johnson. He lives 
there and he's our second strong- 
est operator." 

They were interrupted by voices 
downstairs. A man came up, car- 
rying a bag, and spotted Reyn- 
olds. "Oh, hello, Doctor. What is 
this? I'm on top priority work — 
tank production — when the 
F.B.I, grabs me. You are responsi- 
ble?" 

"Yes. Come with me." McClin- 
tock started to speak, but Reyn- 
olds led the man away. "Mr. 
Nelson, did you bring your fam- 
ily?" 

"No, they're still in Detroit. 
Had I known — " 

"Please! Listen carefully." He 
explained, pointed out a map of 
Detroit in the room to which they 
went, showed him pictures of the 
simulated bomb. "You under- 
stand?" 

Nelson's jaw muscles were 
jumping. "It seems impossible." 

"It is possible. You've got to 
think about that bomb — or 
bombs. Get in touch, squeeze 
them, keep them from going off. 
You'll have to stay awake." 

Nelson breathed gustily. "I'll 
stay awake." 

"That phone will get you any- 
thing you want. Good luck." 

He passed the room occupied 
by the blind clairvoyant; the 
door was open. "Harry, it's Prof. 
Getting anything?" 

The man turned to the voice. 



" It's in the Loop. I could walk to 
it if I were there. A six-story 
building." 

"That's the best you can do?" 

"Tell them to try the attic. I 
get warm when I go up." 

"Right away!" He rushed back, 
saw that Hanby had arrived. 
Swiftly he keyed the communica- 
tions office. "Reynolds speaking. 
The Chicago, bomb is in a six- 
story building in the Loop area, 
probably in the attic. No — that's 
all. G'by!" 

Hanby started to speak; Reyn- 
olds shook his head and looked at 
his watch. Silently the General 
picked up the phone. "This is the 
commanding officer. Have any 
flash sent here." He put the phone 
down and stared at his watch. 

For fifteen endless minutes they 
stood silent. The general broke 
it by taking the phone and say- 
ing, "Hanby. Anything?" 

"No, General. Washington is 
on the wire." 

"Eh? You say Washington?" 

"Yes, sir. Here's the General, 
Mr. Secretary." 

Hanby sighed. "Hanby speak- 
ing, Mr. Secretary. You're all 
right? Washington ... is all 
right?" 

They could hear the relayed 
voice. "Certainly, certainly. 
We're past the deadline. But I 
wanted to tell you: Radio Moscow 
is telling the world that our cities 
are in flames." 



34 



 



Hanby hesitated. "None of 
them are?" 

"Certainly not. I've a talker 
hooked hi to GHQ, which has an 
open line to every city listed. AH 
safe. I don't know whether your 
freak people did any good but, 
one way or another, it was a 
false- — ■*' The line went dead. 

I I an by 's face went dead with it. 
He jiggled the phone. "I've been 
cut off!" 

" Not here, General — at the 
other end. Just a moment." 

They waited. Presently the op- 
erator said, "Sorry, sir. I can't 
gL-t them to answer " 

"Keep trying!" 

It was slightly over a minute — 
it merely seemed longer — when 
the operator said, "Here's your 
party, sir." 

"That you, Hanby?" came the 
voice. " I suppose we'll have 
phone troubles just as we had last 
time. Now, about these ESP peo- 
ple: while we are grateful and all 
that, nevertheless I suggest that 
nothing be released to the papers. 
Might be misinterpreted." 

"Oh. Is that an order, Mr. 
Secretary?" 

"Oh, no, no! But have such 
things routed through my office." 

"Yes, sir." He cradled the 
phone. 

McClintock said, "You should- 
n't have rung off. General. I'd 
like to know whether the Chief 
wants this business continued." 

"Suppose we talk about it on 



the way back to my office." The 
General urged him away, turned 
and gave Reynolds a solemn wink. 

Trays were placed outside the 
doors at six o'clock; most of them 
sent for coffee during the evening. 
M rs. Wi 1 k i n s ordered tea ; she 
kept her door open and chatted 
with anyone who passed. Harry 
the newsboy was searching Mil- 
waukee-; no answer had been re- 
ceived from his tip about Chicago. 
Mrs. Ekstein, or "Princess Ca- 
thay" as she was billed, had re- 
ported a "feeling" about a house 
trailer in Denver and was now 
poring over a map of New Or- 
leans. With the passing of the 
deadline panic abated; communi- 
cations were improving. The 
American people were telling each 
other that they had known that 
those damned commies were bluff- 
ing. 

Hammond and Reynolds sent 
for more coffee at three a.m. ; 
Reynolds' hand trembled as he 
poured. Hammond said, "You 
haven't slept for two nights. Get 
over on that divan." 

"Neither have you." 

"I'll sleep when you wake up." 

"I can't sleep. I'm worrying 
about what'll happen when they 
get sleepy." He gestured at the 
line of doors. 

"So am I." 

At seven a.m. Two-Gun came 
out. " Prof, they got it. The bomb. 
It's gone. Like closing your hand 
on nothing." 



PROJECT NIGHTMARE 



Hammond grabbed the phone. 
"Get me Seattle — the F.B.I, 
office." 

While they waited, Two-Gun 
said, "What now, Prof?" 

Reynolds tried to think. " May- 
be you should rest." 

"Not until this is over. Who's 
got Toledo? I know that burg." 

"Uh . . . young Barnes." 

Hammond was connected; he 
identified himself, asked the ques- 
tion. He put the phone down 
gently. "They did get it," he 
whispered. "It was in the lake." 

" I told you it was wet," 
agreed Two-Gun. "Now, about 
Toledo — " 

"Well . . . tell me when you've 
got it and we'll let Barnes rest." 

McCIintock rushed in at seven 
thirty-five, followed by Hanby. 
"Doctor Reynolds! Colonel Ham- 
mond!" 

" Sh! Quiet! You'll disturb 
them." 

McCIintock said in a lower 
voice, "Yes, surely — I was ex- 
cited. This is important. They 
located a bomb in Seattle and — " 

"Yes. Private Andrews told 
us." 

"Huh? How did he know?" 

"Never mind," Hanby inter- 
vened. "The point is, they found 
the bomb already triggered. Now 
we know that your people are 
protecting the cities." 

"Was there any doubt?" 

"Well . . . yes." 

"But there isn't now," McCIin- 



tock added. "I must take over." 
He bent over the board. "Com- 
munications? Put that White 
House line through here." 

"Just what," Reynolds said 
slowly, "do you mean by 'take 
over'?" 

"Eh? Why, take charge on be- 
half of the President. Make sure 
these people don't let down an 
instant!" 

"But what do you propose to 

&o?" 

Hanby said hastily, "Nothing, 
Doctor. We'll just keep in touch 
with Washington from here." 

They continued the vigil to- 
gether; Reynolds spent the time 
hating McClintock's guts. He 
started to take coffee, then de- 
cided on another benzedrine tablet 
instead. He hoped his people were 
taking enough of it — and not 
too much. They all had it, except 
Grandma Wilkins, who wouldn't 
touch it. He wanted to check with 
them but knew that he could not 
— each bomb was bound only by 
a thread of thought; a split-split 
second of diversion might be 
enough. 

The outside light flashed; Han- 
by took the call. "Congress has 
recessed," he announced, "and 
the President is handing the So- 
viet Union a counter ultimatum ; 
locate and disarm any bombs or 
be bombed in return." The light 
flashed again; Hanby answered. 
His face lit up. " Two more 



36 



 



found, " he told them. "One in 
Chicago, right where your man 
said; the other in Camden." 

"Camden? How?" 

"They rounded up the known 
Communists, of course. This lad- 
die was brought back there for 
questioning, He didn't like that; 
he knew that he was being held 
leas than a mile from the bomb. 
Who is on Camden?" 

"Mr. Dimwiddy." 

"The elderly man with the 
bunions? " 

"That's right — retired post- 
man. General, do we assume that 
there is only one bomb per city? " 

McCHntock answered, "Of 
course not! These people must — " 

Hanby cut in, "Central Intelli- 
gence is assuming so, except for 
New York and Washington. If 
they had more bombs here, they 
would have added more cities." 

Reynolds left to take Dim- 
widdy off watch. McCHntock, he 
fumed, did not realize that people 
were flesh and blood. 

Dimwiddy was unsurprised. "A 
while ago the pressure let up, then 
— well, I'm afraid I dozed. I had 
a terrible feeling that I had let it 
go off, then I knew it hadn't." 
Reynolds told him to rest, then 
be ready to help out elsewhere. 
They settled on Philadelphia ; 
Dimwiddy had once lived there. 

The watch continued. Mrs. 
Ekstein came up with three hits, 
but no answers came back; Reyn- 
olds still had to keep those cities 



covered. She then complained 
that her "sight" had gone; Reyn- 
olds went to her room and told 
her to nap, not wishing to consult 
McCHntock. 

Luncheon trays came and went. 
Reynolds continued worrying over 
how to arrange his operators to 
let them rest. Forty-three people 
and thirty-five cities — if only he 
had two for every city! Maybe 
any of them could watch any 
city? No, he could not chance it. 

Barnes woke up and took back 
Toledo; that left Two-Gun free. 
Should he let him take Cleveland? 
Norman had had no relief and 
Two-Gun had once been through 
it, on a train. The colored boy 
was amazing but rather hyster- 
ical, whereas Two-Gun — well, 
Reynolds felt that Two-Gun 
would last, even through a week 
of no sleep. 

No! He couldn't trust Cleve- 
land to a man who had merely 
passed through it. But with Dim- 
widdy on Philadelphia, when 
Mary Gifford woke he could put 
her on Houston and that would 
let Hank sleep before shifting 
him to Indianapolis and that 
would let him — 

A chess game, with all pawns 
queens and no mistakes allowed. 

McClintock was twiddling the 
selector switch, listening in. Sud- 
denly he snapped, "Someone is 
asleep!" 

Reynolds checked the number.

"Of course, that's the twins' 
room; they take turns. You may 
hear snores in 21 and 30 and 8 
and 19. It's okay; they're off 
watch." 

"Well, all right" McCIintock 
seemed annoyed. 

Reynolds bent back to his 
list. Shortly McCIintock snorted, 
"Who's in room 12?" 

"Uh? Wait — that's Norman 
Johnson, Cleveland." 

" You mean he's on watch?" 

"Yes." Reynolds could hear 
the boy's asthmatic breathing, 
felt relieved. 

" lie's asleep!" 

" No, he's not." 

But McCIintock was rushing 
down the corridor. Reynolds took 
after him; Hammond and Hanby 
followed. Reynolds caught up as 
McCIintock burst into room 12. 
Norman was sprawled in a chair, 
eyes closed in his habitual at- 
titude, McCIintock rushed up, 
slapped hint. "Wake up!" 

Reynolds grabbed McCIintock. 
"You bloody fool!" 

Norman opened his eyes, then 
burst into tears. "It's gone!" 

"Steady, Norman. It's all 
right." 

'.'No, no! It's gone — and my 
mammy's gone with it!" 

McCIintock snapped, "Concen- 
trate, boy! Get back on it!" 

Reynolds turned on him. "Get 
out. Get out before I punch you." 

Hanby and Hammond were in 
the door; the General cut in with 



a hoarse whisper. " Pipe down 
Doctor, bring the boy." 

Back at the board the outside 
light was flashing. Hanby took 
the call while Reynolds tried to 
quiet the boy. Hanby listened 
gravely, then said, " He's right. 
Cleveland just got it." 

McCIintock snapped, "He went 
to sleep. He ought to be shot." 

"Shut up," said Hanby. 

"But—" 

Reynolds said, "Any others. 
General? " 

"Why would there be?" 

"All this racket. It may have 
disturbed a dozen of them." 

"Oh, we'll see." He called 
Washington again. Presently he 
sighed. "No, just Cleveland. We 
were . . . lucky." 

" General," McCIintock in- 
sisted, "he was asleep." 

Hanby looked at him. "Sir, you 
may be the President's deputy, 
but you yourself have no military 
authority. Off my post." 

"But I am directed by the 
President to — " 

"Off my post, sir! Go back to 
Washington. Or to Cleveland." 

McCIintock looked dumb- 
founded. Hanby added, "You're 
worse than bad — you're a fool." 

"The President will hear of 
this." 

"Blunder again and the Presi- 
dent won't live that long. Get out." 

By nightfall the situation was 
rapidly getting worse. Twenty- 
seven cities were still threatened 



38 



 



and Reynolds was losing operators 
faster than bombs were being 
found. Even- M oney Karsch 
would not relieve when awak- 
ened. "See that?" he said, rolling 
dice. " Cold as a well-digger's feet. 
I'm through." After that Reyn- 
olds tested each one who was 
about to relieve, found that some 
were tired beyond the power of 
short sleep to restore them — 
they were "cold". 

By midnight there were eight- 
een operators for nineteen cities. 
The twins he had fearfully split 
up; it had worked. Mrs. Wilkins 
was holding both Washington and 
Baltimore; she had taken Balti- 
more when he had no one to re- 
lieve there. 

But now he had no one for re- 
lief anywhere and three operators 
— Nelson, Two-Gun and Grand- 
ma Wilkins — had had no rest. 
He was too fagged to worry; he 
simply knew that whenever one 
of them reached his limit, the 
United States would lose a city. 
The panic had resumed after the 
bombing of Cleveland ; roads again 
were choked. The disorder made 
harder the search for bombs. But 
there was nothing he could do. 

Mrs. Ekstein still complained 
about her sight but kept at it. 
Harry the newsboy had had no 
luck with Milwaukee, but there 
was no use shifting him ; other cit- 
ies were "dark" to him. During 
the night Mrs. Ekstein pointed to 
the bomb in Houston. It was, she 



said, in a box underground. A 
coffin? Yes, there was a headstone ; 
she was unable to read the name. 

Thus, many recent dead in 
Houston were disturbed. But it 
was nine Sunday morning before 
Reynolds went to tell Mary Gil- 
ford that she could rest — or re- 
lieve for Wilmington, if she felt 
up to it. He found her collapsed 
and lifted her onto the bed, won- 
dering if she had known the 
Houston bomb was found. 

Eleven cities now and eight 
people. Grandma Wilkins held 
four cities. No one else had been 
able to double up. Reynolds 
thought dully that it was a mira- 
cle that they had been able to 
last at all ; it surpassed enormously 
the best test performance. 

Hammond looked up as he re- 
turned. "Make anv changes?" 

"No. The Gifford kid is 
through. We'll lose half a dozen 
cities before this is over." 

"Some of them must be damn 
near empty by now." 

"I hope so. Any more bombs 
found?" 

"Not yet. How do you feel, 
Doc?" 

"Three weeks dead." Reynolds 
sat down wearily. He was wonder- 
ing if he should wake some of 
those sleeping and test them again 
when he heard a noise below; he 
went to the stairwell. 

Up came an M.P. captain. 
"They said to bring her here."

PROJECT NIGHTMARE 



IF THERE was one thing Dr. Kal- 
mar hated, and there were 
many, it was having a new assist- 
ant fresh from a medical school on 
Earth. They always wanted to 
change things. They never realized 
that a planet develops its own 
techniques to meet its own re- 
quirements, which are seldom sim- 
ilar to those of any other world. 
Dr. Kalmar never got along with 
his assistants and he didn't expect 
to get along with this young Dr. 
Hoyt who was coming in on the 
transfer ship from Vega. 

Dr. Kalmar had been trained on 
Earth himself, of course, but he 
wistfully remembered how he had 
revered Dr. Lowell when he had 
been Lowell's assistant. He'd known 
that his own green learning was 
no match for Dr. Lowell's wisdom 
and experience after 30 years on 
Deneb, and he had avidly ac- 
cepted his lessons. 

Why, he grumbled to himself on 
his way to the spaceport to meet 
the unknown whippersnapper, why 
didn't Earth turn out young doc- 
tors the way it used to? They 
ought to have the arrogance 
knocked out of them before they 
left medical school. That's what 
must have happened to him, be- 
cause his attitude had certainly 
been humble when he landed. 

The spaceport was jammed, 
naturally. Ship arrivals were in- 
frequent enough to bring every- 
body from all over the planet who

" Wania know what's wrong with 
women these days? Spoiled! The 
whole kit and kaboodle of 'em. They 
want to sing in nightclubs and hook 
up with some millionaire and wear 
beautiful clothes. Housework is 
something for gadgets to take care 
of, with maids to run the gadgets. 
Afraid to get a few calluses on their 
dainty hands! 

" We got a way to handle that on 
Deneb. A girl gets highfalutin up 
there, the Doc puts her in the Ego 
Alter room. Thicken up her ankles 
a little, take some of the sparkle 
out of her eyes and hair, and you get 
a woman fit to pull a plow! "

was not on duty at the farms, 
Klines* factories, freight and pas- 
senger jets and all the rest of the 
busy activities of this compara- 
tively new colony. They brought 
their lunches and families and 
stood around to watch. Dr. Kal- 
mar went to the platform. 

The ship sat down on a mush- 
room of fire that swiftly became a 
flaming pancake and then was 
squashed out of existence. 

" I'm waiting for a shipment of 
livestock," enthused the man 
standing next to Dr. Kalmar. 

"You're lucky," the doctor said. 
"They can't talk back." 

The man looked at him sympa- 
thetically. " Meeting a female?" 

"Gabbier and more annoying," 
said Dr. Kalmar, but he didn't 
elaborate and the man, with the 
courtesy of the frontier, did not 
pry for an explanation. 

Livestock and freight came 
down on one elevator and passen- 
gers came down another. Slide- 
walks carried the cargo to Sterili- 
zation and travelers to the greet- 
ing platform. Dr. Kalmar felt his 
shoulders droop. The man with 
the medical bag had to be Dr. 
Hoyt and he was even more brisk, 
erect and muscular than Dr. Kal- 
mar had expected, with a superior 
and inquisitive look that made 
the last assistant, unbearable as 
he'd been, seem as tractable as 
one of the arriving cows. 

Dr. Hoyt spotted him instantly 
and came striding over to grab 



his hand in a grip like an ore- 
crusher. "You're Dr. Kalmar. 
Glad to know you. I'm sure we'll 
get along fine together. Miserable 
trip. Had to change ships four 
times to get here. Hope the food's 
better than shipboard slop. Got a 
nice hospital to work in? Do I live 
in or out?" 

Dr. Kalmar was grudgingly 
forced to say rapidly, " Right. 
Likewise. I hope so. Too bad. 
Suits us. I think so. In." 

He got Dr. Hoyt into a jetcab 
and told the driver to make time 
back to the hospital. Appoint- 
ments were piling up while he had 
to make the courtesy trip out to 
the spaceport, which was another 
nuisance. Now he'd have all of 
those and a talkative assistant 
who'd want to know the reasons 
for everything. 

" Pretty barren," said Dr. Hoyt, 
looking out the window at thevege- 
tationless ground below. "Why's 
that?" 

He'd known he was going to 
Deneb, Dr. Kalmar thought an- 
grily. The least he could, have 
done was read up on the place. He 
had. 

"It's an Earth-type planet," 
Dr. Kalmar said in a blunt voice, 
"except that life never developed 
on it. We had to bring everything 
— benign germ cultures, seed, 
animals, fish, insects — a whole 
ecology. Our farms arc close to the 
cities. Too wasteful of freight to 
move them out very far. Another

few centuries and we'll have a real 
population, millions of people in- 
stead of the 20,000 we have now 
in a couple of dozen settlements 
around this world. Then we'll 
have the whole place a nice shade 
of green.*' 

41 City boy myself," said Dr. 
Hoyt. " Hate the country. Hydro- 
ponics and synthetic meat — 
that's the answer." 

"For Earth. It'll be a long time 
before we get that crowded here 
on Deneb." 

"Deneb," the young doctor re- 
peated, dissatisfied. "That's the 
name of the star. You mean to 
tell me the planet has the same 
name?" 

"Most solar systems have only 
one Earth-type planet. It saves a 
lot of trouble to just call that 
planet Deneb, Vega or whatever." 

"Is that clutch of shacks the 
city?" exclaimed Dr. Hoyt. 

"Denebia," said Dr. Kalmar, 
beginning to enjoy himself finally. 

"Why, you could lose it in a 
suburb or Bosyorkdelphia!" 

"That monstrosity that used to 
be New York, Pennsylvania, Con- 
necticut, Rhode Island and Mas- 
sachusetts? I wouldn't want to." 

He was pleased when Dr. Hoyt 
sank into stunned silence. If luck 
was with him, that stupefaction 
might last the whole day. It 
seemed as though it might, for the 
sight of the modest little hospital 
was too much for the youngster 
who had just come from the mam- 



moth health factories of Earth. 

Dr. Hoyt revived somewhat 
when he saw the patients waiting 
in the scantily furnished outer 
room, but Dr. Kalmar said, "Bet- 
ter get yourself settled," and opened 
a door for his immature colleague. 

"But there's only one bed in 
this room," Dr. Hoyt objected. 
"You must have made a mistake." 

Dr. Kalmar, recalling the crowded 
cubicles of Earth, gave out a proud 
little dry laugh. " You're on Deneb 
now, boy. Here you'll have to get 
used to spaciousness. We like el- 
bow room." 

The young doctor went in hesi- 
tantly, leaving the door open for 
a fast escape in case an error had 
been made. Dr. Kalmar had done 
the same when he'd arrived nine 
years ago. Judging by his own ex- 
perience, it would take Dr. Hoyt a 
full six months to get used to hav- 
ing a room all to himself. There 
would be plenty of time to start 
showing him the ropes tomorrow, 
and in the meantime there were 
the backed-up appointments to be 
taken care of. 

Dr. Kalmar went to his office 
and had his nurse, Miss Dupont, 
send in the first patient. 

It was a girl of 17, Avis Emery, 
who had been brought by her par- 
ents. She sat sullenly, dark-haired, 
too daintily pretty and delicately 
shapely for a frontier world like 
this, while Mr. Emery put the 
file from Social Control on the 
doctor's desk. 



NO CHARGE FOR ALTERATIONS

"We're farmers—*' the man 
began. 

Dr. Kalmar interrupted, "The 
information is in the summary. 
Avis is to be assigned her mate 
next year, but she wants to go to 
Earth and become a nightclub 
singer. She refuses to marry a boy 
who'd be able to help around the 
farm, and she won't work on it 
herself." 

He looked up severely at the 
parents. "This is your own fault, 
you know. You pampered her. 
Farm labor is too valuable for 
pampering. We can't afford it." 

"You can blame me, Doc," 
said Mr. Emery miserably. "She's 
such a pretty little thing — I 
couldn't work her the way Sue 
and I work ourselves." 

"And then she started getting 
notions," Mrs. Emery added, giv- 
ing her husband a vicious glare. 
Dr. Kalmar could imagine the 
nights of argument and accusation 
before they were at last forced to 
go for medical help to solve their 
self-created problem. "Singing in 
nightclubs back on Earth, marry- 
ing a billionaire, living in a sky 
yacht!" 

"Avis," said Dr. Kalmar gently. 
"You know it's not that easy, 
don't you? There are lots and lots 
of pretty girls on Earth and very 
few billionaires. If you did get a 
job singing in a nightclub, you 
know you'd have to do some un- 
pleasant things because there's so 
much competition for customers. 



Things like stripteasing, drinking 
at the tables and going out with 
whoever the owner tells you to." 

The girl's face grew animated 
for the first time. "Well, sure! 
Why do you think I want to go? " 

"And you don't love Deneb and 
your farm? " 4 

"I hate both of them!" 

"But you realize that we must 
have food. Doesn't it make you 
feel important to grow more food 
so we can increase our popula- 
tion?" 

"No! Why should I care? I 
want to go to Earth!" 

Dr. Kalmar shook his head re- 
gretfully. He pushed a button on 
his desk. It was connected to a 
gravity generator directly under 
the girl's chair. Four gravities sud- 
denly pushed her down into it and 
a hypodermic needle jabbed her 
swiftly with a hypnotic drug. She 
slumped. He released the button 
and the artificial gravity abated, 
but she remained dazed and re- 
laxed. 

"You're not going to hurt her, 
are you, Doc? " Mr. Emery begged. 

"Certainly not. But I suppose 
you know Social Control's orders." 

They nodded, the husband gloom- 
ily, the wife with a single sharp 
jerk of her head. 

"You go right ahead and do it," 
she said. "I'm sick of working my 
fingers to the bone while she 
primps and preens and talks all 
the time about going to Earth." 



44 



 



"Come, Avis," Dr. Kalmar 
said in a low, commanding voice. 

She stood up, blank-faced, and 
followed him out to the Ego Alter 
room. He closed the door, sat her 
down in the insulated seat next 
to the control console, put the 
wired plastic helmet on her and 
adjusted it to fit her skull snugly. 

Running' his finger down the 
treatment sheet of her Social Con- 
trol file, he set the dials according 
to its instructions. The psychic 
areas to be reduced were sex 
drive, competitiveness and imagi- 
nation, while the areas of repro- 
ductive urge and cooperation were 
to be intensified. He regulated the 
individual timers and sent the 
varying charge through her brain. 

There was no reaction, no con- 
vulsion, no distortion of features. 
She sat there as if nothing had 
happened, but her personality had 
changed as completely as though 
she had been retrained from birth. 

Miss Dupont came in without 
knocking. She knew, of course, 
that any patient in the Ego Alter 
room would be incapable of being 
disturbed. 

"Rephysical, Dr. Kalmar?" she 
asked. 

"I'm afraid so. Will you pre- 
pare her, please? " 

The nurse removed the girl's 
clothes. There was no resistance. 

"Such a lovely body," she said. 
"It's a shame." 

He shrugged. "Until we have 
enough people and farms and in- 



dustries, Miss Dupont, we'll just 
have to get used to altering people 
to fit the needs of our society. I'm 
sure you understand that." 

"Yes, but it still seems a shame. 
Bodies like that don't grow on 
trees." 

He gently moved the girl into 
the Rephysical Chamber. "They 
grow in this machine, though. As 
soon as we can afford it, which 
ought to be only a few hundred 
years from now, we can make any 
woman look like this, or even 
better." 

"And don'L forget the men," 
Miss Dupont said as he started 
the mitogenetic generator. "We 
could use some Adonises around 
here." 

"We'll have them," he assured 
her. 

"Somebody will. None of us'll 
live that long." 

Working like a sculptor with a 
cathode in one hand and an anode 
in the other, Dr. Kalmar began 
reshaping the_girl who stood fix- 
edly in the boxlike chamber. The 
flesh fled from the cathode and 
chased af ter the anode as he 
broadened the fine nose, thick- 
ened the mobile lips, squared the 
slender jaw and drew out care- 
fully the delicately arched orbital 
ridges. 

" I'll leave the curl in her hair," 
he said. "Every woman needs at 
least one feature she can be proud 
of."

"You're telling me," Miss Du- 
pont replied. 

"Synthetic tissue, please." 

She drew out a tube with a 
variable nozzle and started work- 
ing just ahead of him. A spray of 
high-velocity cells shot through 
the girl's smooth skin at the neck, 
shoulders, breasts, hips and legs, 
forming shapeless lumps that he 
guided into cords and muscles. 
The slim figure quickly broad- 
ened, grew brawny and compe- 
tent-looking, the body of a woman 
who could breed phenomenally 
while farming alongside her man. 

Dr. Kalmar racked up the in- 
struments and helped Miss Du- 
pont dress the girl in coveralls and 
sandals. He felt the pride of crafts- 
manship when he found that the 
clothing supplied for her by Social 
Control exactly fitted her. He in- 
jected an antidote to the hypnotic 
and gave her the standard test for 
emotional response as her expres- 
sionless face cleared to placidity. 

"Do you know where you are, 
Avis?" 

"Yes. Ego Alter and Rephysi- 
cal." 

"What have wc done to you?" 
" Changed me to fit my environ- 
ment." 

"Do you resent being changed?" 

"No." She paused and looked 
worried. "Who's taking care of 
the crops while I'm here?" 

"They can wait till you and 
your parents get back, Avis. Let's 
show them the change, shall we?" 



"All right," she said. "I think 
they'll be proud of me. This is how 
they always wanted me to be." 

"And you? " 

"Oh, I feel much better. As if I 
don't have to try so hard." 

"I'm glad, Avis. Miss Dupont, 
better have a sedative ready when 
her father sees her. I think he'll 
need it." 

"And her mother?" asked the 
nurse practically. 

"She'll probably want a drink 
to celebrate. Give her one." 

Dr. Kalmar's prognosis was 
correct, only it didn't go far 
enough. His young assistant from 
Earth had come scooting out of 
his disquietingly large quarters 
and was j ittering in the office 
when they entered. 

"Is that the pretty girl who was 
waiting when we came in?" he 
yelped in outrage. "What have 
you done to her? " 

Dr. Kalmar gave the sedative 
to him instead of Mr. Emery, who 
was shocked, but had known in 
advance what to expect. Miss Du- 
pont prepared another sedative 
quickly, gave Mrs. Emery a cele- 
bration drink and moved the fam- 
ily toward the door. 

"She looks fine, Doctor," the 
mother said happily. "Avis ought 
to be a big help around the house 
and farm from now on." 

"I'm sure she will," he said. 

"But she was so lovely!" wept 
Mr. Emery, though in a rapidly 



46 



 



becalming voice .is the sedative 
took effect. 

The door closed behind them. 

"You ought to be reported to 
the Medical Association back on 
Earth!" Dr. Hoyt said angrily. 
" Ruining a girl's looks like that ! " 

Dr. Kalmar sighed. He had 
hoped to be able to put off this 
orientation lecture until the fol- 
lowing day, when there wouldn't 
be so many patients jamming his 
appointment book. 

"All right, let's get it over with. 
First. I was also trained on Earth 
and know how Ego Alter and Re- 
physical are used there: Ego Al- 
ter to remove psychic blocks so 
people can compete better, and 
Kephysical so they'll be more at- 
tractive. Second, we're not under 
the jurisdiction of Earth's Medi- 
cal Association. Third, we'd damn 
well better not be, because our 
problems and solutions aren't the 
same at all." 

"You'd have been jailed for 
spoiling that girl's chances of a 
good marriage!" 

"I didn't," Dr. Kalmar said 
quietly. "I improved them." 

"You did nothing of the — " 
Dr. Hoyt stopped. "Improved? 
How? " 

"I keep telling you this is a 
frontier world and you keep act- 
ing as if you understand, but you 
don't. Look, a family is an eco- 
nomic liability on Earth; it con- 
sumes without producing. That's 
why girls have so much trouble 



finding husbands there. Out here 
it's different. A family is an asset 
— if every member in it is willing 
to work." 

"But a pretty girl like that can 
always get by." 

" No Denebian can afford to 
marry a pretty girl. It's too risky. 
She can't work as hard as we do 
and still take care of her looks. 
And he'd worry about her con- 
stantly, which would cut into his 
efficiency. By having me make her 
a merely attractive girl in a whole- 
some, hearty way, Social Control 
guarantees more than just a mar- 
riage for her — it guarantees a 
contented married life." 

"Sweating away on a farm," 
Dr. Hoyt said. 

"Now that her anti-social striv- 
ings are gone, she'll realize that 
Deneb needs farmers instead of 
nightclub singers. She'll take pride 
in being a good worker, she'll raise 
as many children as she'll be 
capable of bearing, and she'll 
have a good husband and a pros- 
perous farm. That wouldn't have 
satisfied her before. It will now. 
And she's better for it and so is 
Deneb." 

Dr. Hoyt shook his head. "It's 
all upside down." 

"You'll get used to it. Why not 
take today off and explore Dene- 
bia? You need a rest after all those 
months in space." 

"Maybe I will," said Dr. Hoyt 
vaguely, slightly anesthetized. 
"Good." Dr. Kalmar buzzed

for Miss Dupont. "Send in the 
next patient, please. Oh, and Dr. 
Hoyt is taking the day off." 

But the young assistant was 
stunned into staying by the huge 
size of the Social Control file that 
was carried by the next patient, 
Mr. Fallon, and his wife. 

" I know just what you're think- 
ing, Dr. Kalmar ! ' ' cried Mis. 
Fallon distractedly, but with a 
nervously bright smile. "Those 
awful Fallons again ! I don't blame 
you a bit, but — " 

As a matter of fact, that was 
exactly what Dr. Kalmar was 
thinking, plus the defeated feeling 
that they were all he needed to 
make the day complete. 

"Good Lord, what's in all those 
files?" Dr. Hoyt exclaimed. 

Dr. Kalmar could have ex- 
plained, but he didn't feel up to it. 

Mr. Fallon, a wispy, shyly af- 
fable, poetic-looking chap, did it 
for him. "Papers," he said. 

" 1 know that, but why so 
many?" Dr. Hoyt asked impa- 
tiently. 

Miss Dupont seemed wryly 
amused as she watched his con- 
sternation. 

"I guess you might say it's be- 
cause 1 can't make my mind up," 
confessed Mrs. Fallon with an 
uneasy giggle. She was a big 
woman who might have gurgled 
over a collection of toy dogs on 
Earth, but here she was a freight 
checker and her husband was a 



statistician in the Department, of 
Supply, though on Earth he might 
have been anything from a com- 
poser to a social worker. "No 
matter how often we rephysical 
Harry, I always get tired of his 
looks in a few months." 

"And how often has that been 
done?" Dr. Hoyt demanded. 

"I think it's eleven times. Isn't 
that right, dear? " 

"No, sweet," said Mr. Fallon. 
"Thirteen." 

Dr. Kalmar could have inter- 
rupted, but he considered it wiser 
to let his assistant learn the hard 
way. Miss Dupont was enjoying 
it too much to interfere. 

"We've made him tall and 
we've made him short, skinny, fat, 
bulging with muscle, red hair, 
black hair, blond hair, gray hair 
— I don't know, just about every- 
thing in the book," said Mrs. 
Fallon, "and I simply can't seem 
to find one I'd like for keeps." 

"Then why the devil don't you 
get another husband?" 

Mrs. Fallon looked shocked. 
"Why, he was assigned to me!" 

"Dr. Hoyt just came from 
Earth," Dr. Kalmar cut in at last, 
before a brawl could start. "He's 
not familiar with our methods." 

"Let's hear the cockeyed rea- 
son," Dr. Hoyt said resignedly. 

"We keep our population bal- 
anced," said Dr. Kalmar. "Too 
many of either sex creates tension, 
hostility, loss of efficiency; look at 
Earth if you want proof. We can't 



48 



amazing; stories 



risk even a little of that, so we use 
prenatal sex control to keep them 
exactly equal." 

"There's a wife for every man," 
Mr. Fallon put in genially, "and a 
husband for every woman. Works 
out fine." 

"With no surplus," Dr. Kalmar 
added. "There are no floaters to 
allow the kind of marital moving; 
day you have on Earth, where so 
many just up and shift over to 
new mates. We get ours for life. 
That's where Ego Alter and Re- 
physical come in." 

"You mean people bring in 
their mates to have them done 
over?" 

" If they're not satisfied and if 
the mates agree lo be changed." 

"I don't mind," said Mr. Fal- 
lon virtuously. "I figure Mabel 
will decide what she wants one of 
these changes, and then we can 
settle down and be happy with 
each other." 

"But what about you?" asked 
Dr. Hoyt, bewildered. " Don't 
you want her changed?" 

"Oh, no. I like her fine just as 
she is." 

"You see now how it works?" 
Dr. Kalmar asked. "We can't 
have a variety nf mates, but we 
can have nil the variety we want 
in one mate. It comes to the same 
thing, as far as I can see, and 
causes much less confusion, espe- 
cially since we need stable rela- 
tionships." 

Dr. Hoyt was striving heroic- 



ally to stay indignant in spite of 
the sedative. "And do many ask 
to have their mates changed?" 

" I guess we're a sort of record, 
aren't we?" Mr. Fallon boasted. 

"I guess you are," agreed Dr. 
Kalmar. "And now, Dr. Hoyt, if 
there aren't any more questions, 
I'd like to proceed with this 
couple." 

Dr. Hoyt stretched his eyes 
wide to keep them open. li lt% all 
screwy to me, but it's none of my 
business. As soon as I finish my 
internship, I'm heading back to 
Earth, where things make sense, 
so I don't have to understand this 
mishmash you call a planet. Need 
help?" 

"If you'd find out what Mrs. 
Fallon has in mind this time, it 
would let me run the patients 
through a lot faster." 

" How would they feel about 
it?" Dr. Hoyt asked. 

"It's all right with me." Mr. 
Fallon said amiably. "I'm pretty 
used to this, you know." 

' ' But what are we going to 
make you look like, Harry?" his 
wife fretted. "I felt very jealous 
of other women when you were 
handsome and I didn't like you 
just ordinary-looking." 

"Why not go through the 
model book with Dr. Hoyt?" sug- 
gested Dr. Kalmar. "There are 
still some types you haven't 
tried." 

"There are?" she asked in 
gratified astonishment. ' ' Would

you mind very much, Dr. Hoyt?" 

" Glad to," he said. 

Miss Dupont brought out the 
model book for him, and he and 
Mrs. Fallon studied the facial and 
physical types that were very ex- 
plicitly illustrated there in three- 
dimensional full color. Mr. Fal- 
lon, contentedly working out math 
problems on a sheet of paper, left 
the choice entirely to her. 

Meanwhile, Dr. Kalmar and 
Miss Dupont swiftly took care of 
a succession of other patients, 
raising the tolerance level of frus- 
tration in a watchmaker, replat- 
ing the acne-pitted skin of a sensi- 
tive youth, restoring a finger lost 
in a machine-shop accident, and 
building up good-natured aggres- 
sion in an ore miner whose pro- 
ductivity had slumped. 

Mrs. Fallon still hadn't decided 
when the last patient had been 
taken care of. She said unhappily, 
"I don't know. I simply abso- 
lutely don't know. Couldn't you 
suggest something, Dr. Hoyt?" 

"Wouldn't be ethical," he told 
her bluntly. "Not allowed to." 

Dr. Kalmar, checking the So- 
cial Control papers with Miss 
Dupont, wondered if he should 
interfere. It would lower con- 
fidence in Dr. Hoyt, which meant 
that people would insist on Dr. 
Kalmar '-8 treating them. Then, 
instead of having an assisLanL to 
remove some of the load, he'd 
have to do the work of two men. 



He decided to let the young doc- 
tor handle it. 

But Dr. Hoyt stood up in exas- 
peration, slammed the book shut, 
and said, "Mrs. Fallon, if you 
know what you want, FN be glad 
to oblige. But I'm not a tele- 
pathy — " 

"Is Lhere anything I can do?" 
Dr. Kalmar interrupted quickly, 
before his assistant could create 
any more damage. 

" He doesn't have to get huffy," 
Mrs. Fallon said indignantly. 
"All I asked for was a suggestion 
or two." 

"Insult my wife, will he?" Mr. 
Fallon belligerently added. 

"It's my fault," Dr. Kalmar 
said. "Dr. Hoyt just got in today 
from Earth and he's tired and he 
naturally doesn't understand all 
our ways yet — 

"Yet?" Dr. Hoyt repeated in 
disgust. "What makes you think 
I'll ever — " 

1 1 And I shouldn't have bur- 
dened him with this problem until 
he's had a chance to rest up and 
look around," Dr. Kalmar con- 
tinued in a slightly louder voice. 
"Now, let's see if we can't settle 
this problem before closing time, 
eh?" 

The Fallons subsided, Dr. Hoyt 
watched with a sarcastic eye, 
though he kept silent as Dr. Kal- 
mar and Miss Dupont, working 
as a shrewd team, gave them the 
suggestion they had been looking 



50 



 



NO CHARGE FOR ALTERATIONS 



for. It was all done very smoothly, 
so smoothly that Dr. Kalmar felt 
professional pride because even 
his stiff-necked assistant was un- 
able to detect the fact that it was 
a suggestion. 

Dr. Kalmar got Mrs. Fallon to 
reminisce about the alterations 
her husband had undergone, and 
Miss Dupont promptly agreed 
with her when she explained why 
each had been unsatisfactory. It 
took some time, but he eventually 
brought her back to what Mr. 
Fallon had looked like when she'd 
first married him. 

"Now, isn't that the strangest 
thing?" she said, puzzled. "I 
can't remember. Can you, dear?" 

"It's a little mixed up," Mr. 
Fallon admitted. "Let's see, I 
know I was taller and I think I 
had a long, thin face — " 

"Oh, we don't have to guess," 
Dr. Kalmar said. "Nurse, we 
have the information on file, 
don't we?" 

"Yes, Doctor," she said, and 
instantly produced a photograph. 
They evidently thought it was 
merely filing efficiency ;, they 
hadn't noticed her searching for 
the picture quietly while Dr. 
Kalmar had been leading them on. 
He had, in fact, delayed asking 
her until she'd nodded to indicate 
that she had found it. 

Mr. Fallon frowned as if he'd 
recognized the face but couldn't 
remember the name. His wife 
gave a little shriek of admiration. 



"Why, Harry, you looked per- 
fectly wonderful!" 

"Those deep dimples made 
shaving pretty hard," he recalled. 

"But they're darling\ Why did 
you ever let me change you?" 

"Because I wanted you to be 
happy, sweet." 

It was as simple as that — a bit 
of practical psychology based on 
knowledge of the patients. Dr. 
Kalmar wished wistfully that old 
Dr. Lowell had been there to ob- 
serve. He would have approved, 
which might have made up for 
Dr. Hoyt's unpleasant expression. 

"I hope this is the one you 
want," Dr. Kalmar said as he 
took them to the front door after 
the rephysical. 

"Goodness, I hope so!" Mrs. 
Fallon exclaimed. She looked 
fondly at her husband, and this 
time had to look up to see his 
face. "I'm almost positive this is 
what I want Harry to be." 

"Well, if it isn't, sweet," Mr. 
Fallon said, "we'll try something 
else. I don't mind as long as it 
makes you happy." 

They closed the door behind 
them, leaving the hospital empty 
of all but the small staff. 

"They're crazy!" Dr. Hoyt 
exploded. "He's not the one we 
should be changing. That idiotic 
female needs a good Ego Alter!" 

"He hasn't asked for it," Dr. 
Kalmar pointed out patiently. 
"Then he ought to!" 
"That's his decision, isn't it? 



52 



AMAZING STOKIES 



There's such a thing as ethics, 
you know." 

"I've never seen anything more 
insane than the way you work," 
snapped Dr. Hoyt. "I can't wait 
to finish my stretch here and go 
home." 

He stamped out, weaving 
slightly because of the sedative. 

"Well, what do you think of 
our assistant? " asked Dr. Kalmar. 

"He's cute," Miss Dupont said 
irrationally. 

Dr. Kalmar glowered at her. 
He'd forgotten that she was due 
to have a mate assigned to her 
this year. 

Routine at the hospital was 
anything but routine. Dr. Hoyt 
barely kept from yelping each 
time someone was treated, and 
his help was given so unwillingly 
that Dr. Kalmar, sweating under 
a double load and with Dr. Hoyt 
to argue with at the same time, 
was all for putting him on the 
ship and asking Earth for another 
intern. But Miss Dupont talked 
him out of it. 

For no discernible reason other 
than loneliness, Dr. Hoyt was 
taking her out. She was pleased, 
even though he crabbed con- 
stantly about the shabby-looking 
clothes she wore, which were 
typical of Deneb, and the way 
they fitted her. 

Either the two of them didn't 
talk shop, or she had no influence 
with him — his criticism and im- 



patience grew sharper each week. 

It bothered Dr. Kalmar more 
than lie thought it should, and 
much more than Mrs. Kalmar 
wanled it to. She was a pleasant 
little woman who liked things as 
they were, which was why Dr. 
Kalmar had hesitated all this 
while toask her to undergo a slight 
rephysical ; he would have pre- 
ferred her a little taller, more 
filled out, her slight wrinkles 
deleted and, while he was think- 
ing about it, he wished she'd let 
him give her space-black hair in- 
stead of her indeterminately 
blondish mop. But he'd rather 
have her as she was than peevish, 
so he had never mentioned it. 

"Don't let the boy upset you, 
she said. "It's only that he's so 
young and inexperienced. You 
can't expect him to adjust quickly 
to a new environment and a whole 
new medical orientation." 

"But that's just what annoys 
me! Why, I used to hang onto 
every word of Dr. Lowell's when 
I came here! I never thought I 
knew better than he did." 

"Well, dear, you're you and 
Dr. Lowell is Dr. Lowell and Dr. 
Hoyt is Dr. Hoyt." 

He tried to think of an answer 
and couldn't. "I suppose so." 

"Maybe you'd feel better if 
you spoke to Dr. Lowell about it." 

"What could he do? This is 
really an internal problem that I 
should work out with Dr. Hoyt. I 
can't involve Dr. Lowell in it."

But it became intolerable when 
there was a young girl who 
wanted to be a boy and Dr. Kal- 
mar and Dr. Hoyt got into the 
worst battle yet. Naturally, she 
had to be given an Ego Alter lo 

make her happy about being a 
girl, whereas Dr. Hoyt argued 
that she should be allowed to be a 
boy if that was what she wanted. 
Dr. Kalmar explained angrily 
once more than the sexes were 
exactly balanced and Dr. Hoyt 
quoted the rule of personal 
choice. It was applicable on 
Earth, but not on Deneb, Dr. 
Kalmar retorted, to which Dr. 
Hoyt snorted something about 
playing God. 

Dr. Kalmar confessed harshly 
to his wife that she was right. He 
had to bring old Dr. Lowell into 
the situation; it was out of Dr. 
Kalmar's control and was keeping 
the hospital in a turmoil. It was 
time for Dr. Lowell to inspect the 
hospital, the job he had taken in 
place of actual retirement. Dr. 
Kalmar needed help from Miss 
Dupont to bring the problem out 
into the open. But she became 
unexpectedly obstinate. 

"I won't hurt Leo's career," 
she explained flatly. 

Dr. Kalmar gave her a vacant 
look. " Leo? " 

She blushed. "Dr. Hoyt. He's 
honestly trying to understand, 
but he finds it so different from 
Earth. Practically everything we 
do here is in reverse." 

54 



"But so is our environment, 
Miss Dupont. Earth is over- 
crowded and Deneb is under- 
populated, so of course our meth- 
ods would be the opposite of 
Earth's. He has to be made to see 
that we must solve our problems 
our own way." 

She studied his face suspi- 
ciously. "That's all you want?" 

"Certainly. Damn it, do you 
think I want him fired and sent 
back to Earth before his intern- 
ship's up? I know it would hurt 
his record. Besides, I need an 
assistant — but not one I have to 
bicker with every time I make a 
move." 

"Well, in that case — " 

"Good girl. All you have to do 
is help me hold off the cases he'd 
argue about until Dr. Lowell gets 
here." He stared down glumly at 
his hands, which were gripping 
each other tightly. "God knows 
I'm no diplomat. Dr. Lowell is. 
He convinced me easily enough 
when I came here. Maybe he can 
do the same with Dr. Hoyt." 

4 ' Oh , I hope he can , ' 1 Miss 
Dupont said earnestly. "I want 
so much to have you and Leo 
work together in harmony." 

He glanced up, curious. 
"Why?" 

"Because I'm in love with 
him." 

He found himself nodding bit- 
terly. Having Dr. Hoyt go back 
to Earth wouldn't be a fraction as 
bad as Miss Dupont leaving with 

 



him. So now there was something 
else to worry about. 

Dr. Lowell came bouncing out 
of the jetcab a few days later. 
"The hospital better be spot- 
less!" he called out jovially, pay- 
ing off the hankie. " I'm in a mean 
mood. Liable to suspend every- 
body." 

There was a strange lift to Dr. 
Kalmar's spirits as the old man 
entered the office. He wished 
without hope that he could inspire 
the same sort of reverence and 
respect. Impossible, of course. Dr. 
Lowell was great; he himself was 
nothing more than competent. 

Dr. Kalmar introduced his 
young assistant to the old man. 

"Young and strong," Dr. Low- 
ell approved. "That's what we 
need on Deneb. Skill is important, 
but health and youth even more 
so." 

"For those who stay," said Dr. 
Hoyt frostily. "I'm not." 

Dr. Kalmar felt himself quiver 
with rage. The wet-nosed pup 
couldn't talk to Dr. Lowell like 
that! 

But Dr. Lowell was saying 
cheerily, "You seem to have made 
up your mind to go back. No mat- 
ter. Some decisions are like egg- 
shells — made only to be broken. 
I hope that's what you'll do with 
yours. ' ' 

"Not a chance," Dr. Hoyt said. 
He didn't take the arrogant ex- 
pression off his face even when 



Miss DuponL looked at him 
pleadingly. 

"Then I say let's signal the 
next ship—" Dr. Kalmar began. 

Dr. Lowell cut in quickly, " You 
two have patients to attend to, I 
see. Don't worry about me. I 
know my way around this poor 
little wretch of a building. Not 
much like Earth hospitals, is it?" 
He headed for the medical supply 
room, adding just before he went 
in, "A lot can be said for small 
installations. The personal touch, 
you know." 

Dr. Kalmar enviously realized 
how deftly the old man had put 
the youngster in his place, whereas 
he would have stood there and 
slugged it out verbally. Lord, if he 
could only acquire that awesome 
wisdom ! 

"Well, back to work," he said, 
trying to imitate the cheeriness at 
least. 

"Sure, let's ruin some more 
lives," Dr. Hoyt almost snarled. 

"Leo, please!" whispered Miss 
Dupont imploringly. 

Five minutes later the two doc- 
tors were furiously arguing over a 
very old man who had been sent 
by Social Control to have his 
eyesight strengthened. 

"You have no right to let any- 
body dodder around like this!'* 
Dr. Hoyt yelled. "What in hell is 
Rephysical for if not for such 
cases?" 

"You probably think we ought 
to make him look like 25 again," 



NO CHARGE FOR ALTERATIONS 



55 



Dr. Kalmar yelled back. " If 
that's all you've learned working 
here — " 

"Now, now," said Dr. Lowell 
soothingly. He'd come in unno- 
ticed by either of the men. "Dr. 
Hoyt is right, of course. We would 
like to make old people young and 
some day we'll be able to afford it. 
But not for some time to come." 

"Why not?" Dr. Hoyt de- 
manded in a lower tone, visibly 
flattered by Dr. Lowell's seem- 
ingly taking his side. 

" Rephysical can't actually 
make anyone young. It can only 
give the outward appearance of 
youth and replace obviously dis- 
eased parts. But an old body is an 
old organism ; il has to break down 
eventually. If we give it more 
vigor than it can endure, it breaks 
down too soon, much sooner than 
if we let it age normally. That 
represents economic loss as well 
as a humanitarian one." 

" I don't follow you," Dr. Hoyt 
said bewilderedly. 

"Well, our patient used to he a 
machinist. A good one. Now he's 
only able to be an oiler. A good 
one, too, when you improve his 
eyesight. He can go on doing that 
for years, performing a useful 
function. But he'd wear himself 
out in no time as a machinist 
again if you de-aged him." 

" Is that supposed to make 
sense? " 

"It does," said Dr. Lowell, 
"for Deneb." 



Dr. Hoyt wanted to continue 
the discussion, but Dr. Lowell 
was already on his way to inspect 
another part of the hospital. 
Grumbling, the young man helped 
chart the optical nerves that had 
to be replaced and measure the 
new curve of the retinas ordered 
by Social Control. 

But he fought just as strenu- 
ously over other cases, especially 
a retired freight-jet pilot who had 
to have his reflexes slowed down 
so he could become a contented 
meteorologist. Whenever there 
was a loud disagreement of this 
sort, Dr. Lowell .was there to 
mediate calmly. 

At the end of the day, Dr. Kal- 
mar was emotionally exhausted, 
He said as he and Dr. Lowell were 
washing up, "The kid's hopeless. 
I thought you could straighten 
him out — God knows I couldn't 
— but he'll never see why we 
have to work the way we do." 

"What do you suggest?" Dr. 
Lowell asked through a towel. 

"Send him back to Earth. Get 
an intern who's more malleable." 

Dr. Lowell tossed the towel 
into the sterilizer. "Can't be done. 
We're expanding so fast all over 
the Galaxy that Earth can't train 
and ship out enough doctors for 
the new colonies. If we sent him 
back, I don't know when we'd get 
another." 

Dr. Kalmar swallowed. "You 
mean it's him or nobody?" 



S6 



 



"Afraid so." 

"But he'll never fit in on 
Deneb! " 

"You did," Dr. Lowell said. 

Dr, Kalmar tried to smile mod- 
estly. "I realized immediately 
how little I knew and how much 
more experience you had. 1 was 
willing to learn. Why, I used to 
listen to you and watch you work 
and try to see your reasons for 
doing things — " 

" You think so? " asked Dr. 
Lowell. 

Dr. Kalmar glanced at him in 
astonishment. "You know I did. I 
still do, for that matter." 

"When you landed on Deneb," 
said Dr. Lowell, "you were the 
most stubborn , opinionated young 
ass I'd ever met." 

Dr. Kalmar's smile became an 
appreciative grin. "Damn, I wish 
I had that light touch of yours!" 

"You were so dogmatic and 
argumentative that Dr. Iloyt is a 
suggestible schoolboy in compari- 
son . ' ' 

"Well, you don't have to go 
that far," Dr. Kalmar said. "I get 
what you're driving at — every 
in tern needs orientation and I 
should be more patient and un- 
derstanding." 

"Then you don't follow me at 
all," stated Dr. Lowell. "Jnvite 
Dr. Hoyt, Miss Dupont and me 
to your house for dinner tonight 
and maybe you'll get a better idea 
of what I mean." 



"Anything for a free meal, 

eh?" 

"And to keep a doctor here on 
Deneb that we'd lose otherwise." 

"Implying that I can't do it." 

"Isn't that the decision you'd 
come to? " 

"Yes, I guess it is," Dr. Kalmar 
confessed. "All right, how about 
dinner at my house tonight? I'll 
round up the other two and call 
Harriet so she'll expect us." 

"Delighted to come," said Dr. 
Lowell. "Nice of you to ask me." 

Miss Dupont was elated at the 
invitation and Dr. Hoyt said he 
had nothing else to do anyway. 
On the videophone Mrs. Kalmar 
was dismayed for a moment, until 
Dr. Lowell told her to put 
through an emergency order to 
Central Commissary and he'd 
verify it. 

That was when Dr. Kalmar 
realized how serious the old man 
was. On a raw planet where crises 
were everyday routine, a situation 
had to be catastrophic before it 
could be called an emergency. 

Dinner on Deneb was the same 
as anywhere else in the Galaxy. 
To free women for other work, 
food was delivered weekly in 
cooked form. A special messenger 
from Central Commissary had 
brought the emergency rations 
and Mrs. Kalmar had simply 
punctured the self-heat cartridges 
and put the servings in front of 
each guest; the containers were

57 



disposable plates and came with 
single-use plastic utensils. No 
garbage, no preparation, no clean- 
ing up afterward, except to toss 
them all into the converter fur- 
nace. Dr. Hoyt was still not accus- 
toned to wholly grown foods; he'd 
been raised on synthetics, of 
course, which were the staples on 
Earth. 

' ' Wei 1 , that was good , ' ' said 
Dr. Lowell, getting up from the 
table with his round little belly 
comfortably expanded. "Now, 
let's have a few drinks before we 
start a professional bull session. 
Where do you keep your liquor? 
I'd like to mix my special so Dr. 
Hoyt can see we colonials are not 
so provincial." 

"Good Lord, I haven't had 
your special for years! " exclaimed 
Dr. Kalmar. "Since about the 
time I came to Deneb, in fact." 

"That's why it's a special. Re- 
served for state occasions, such as 
arrivals of colleagues from our 
dear old home planet." 

"Oh, you don't have to go to 
all that bother," said Dr. Hoyt. 
"You'd have to make it twice — 
once now and once when I leave." 

"That won't be for quite a 
while, will it? " Miss Dupont 
asked anxiously. 

"As soon as I finish my intern- 
ship. No more alien worlds for me. 
I like Earth." 

Mrs. Kalmar got him to talk 
about it, which was much easier 
than getting him to stop, while 



Dr. Kalmar showed the old man 
where the liquor stock and fixings 
were kept. Watching him mix the 
ingredients with a chemist's care, 
Dr. Kalmar felt a glow of nostal- 
gia. He recalled the celebration 
at Dr. Lowell's house, several 
months after he had come from 
Earth, when he'd enjoyed himself 
so much that he'd passed out. It 
was one of the pleasanter memo- 
ries of his start on Deneb. 

"Can't mix them all in a single 
batch," Dr. Lowell explained, 
bringing the drinks over one at a 
time as he finished preparing 
them. "Mrs. Kalmar . . . Miss 
Dupont . . . our gracious host, 
Dr. Kalmar . . . and now Dr. 
Hoyt and myself." He lifted his 
glass at Dr. Hoyt. "Welcome to 
our latest associate — product, 
like ourselves, of the great medi- 
cal schools of Earth. It's a forlorn 
hope, but may he learn as much 
from us about our peculiar meth- 
ods as we learn from him about 
the latest terrestrial advances." 

Dr. Hoyt, smiling as if he 
didn't think it possible, stood up 
when they'd downed their toast 
to him. "To Earth," he said. 
"May I get back in record time." 
He gulped it, said, "Delicious — 
for a colonial drink," and froze 
with his smile as fixed as if it had 
been painted on. 

"Leo!" Miss Dupont cried, and 
shook him, but he stayed frozen. 

"The man's allergic to alco-

hoi!" said Dr. Kalmar, astonished. 

"Do something!" Mrs. Kalmar 
begged. "Don't let him stand 
there like that! He — he looks 
like a petrified man!" 

"Don't get panicky," said Dr. 
Lowell in a quiet, confident voice. 
"That's when you passed out, 
Dr. Kalmar. Right after your first 
taste of my special." 

"But we haven't," Dr. Kalmar 
objected. 

"Naturally. Your drinks 
weren't drugged." 

"Drugged?" shrieked Miss Du- 
pont. "You doped him?" 

"That's rather obvious, isn't 
it?" 

"But — what for?" Dr. Kal- 
mar stammered. 

"Same reason I slipped you a 
mickey not. long after you got 
here. We can't take any chances 
that he'll ship back to Earth. You 
see ? ' ' 

"I don't," raged Miss Dupont. 
"I think it's a cheap, dirty, foul 
trick and it won't work, either. 
You can't keep him drugged." 

"I don't like you talking to 
Dr. Lowell like thai," said Dr. 
Kalmar indignantly. 

"You should be the last one to 
object," Mrs. Kalmar pointed 
out. "He said he drugged you, 
too." 

"I know," Dr. Kalmar said 
blankly. "I don't understand — " 

"You will," promised Dr. Low- 
ell. "Just come along and don't 
interfere. Better give him the 



order; it'll keep things straighter." 

Mrs. Kalmar was grimly disap- 
proving and Miss Dupont was 
close to hysteria. Only Dr. Kal- 
mar retained his awed respect for 
Dr. Lowell. If the old man said it 
was all right, it was, even if he 
couldn't see the reason. 

"Go ahead," urged Dr. Lowell. 

"Dr. Hoytl" 

"Yes, Dr. Kalmar?" 

"You will come with us!" 

"Yes, Dr. Kalmar." 

Dr. Lowell took them back to 
the hospital. 

"Now what?" asked Dr. Kal- 
mar. 

"You actually don't know?" 
Miss Dupont demanded. "He 
wants to put Leo through the 
Ego Alter." 

"That's absurd," Dr. Kalmar 
said angrily, "and an outright 
slander. Dr. Lowell wouldn't con- 
sider suqh a thing — the boy 
didn't ask for it and it wasn't 
authorized by Social Control." 

Dr. Lowell smiled genially and 
opened the door to the Ego Alter 
room. "I hate to disillusion you, 
Dr. Kalmar. That's exactly what 
I have in mind — the same thing 
I did to you," 

"That's absurd," Dr. Kalmar 
repeated, but with less conviction 
and more confusion than before. 

"It worked. Tell him to sit 
down." 

Dr. Kalmar did, and automa- 
tically fitted the wired plastic 
helmet to Dr. Iloyt's head.

"You can't!" cried Miss Du- 
pont as he reached for the dials on 
the control console. "It's not 
fair!" 

"Let's not get involved in a 
discussion on ethics," Dr. Lowell 
said. "Deneb can't afford to lose 
him; we need every doctor we 
have. If he goes back to Earth it 
may be years before we get a 
replacement." 

"But you can't do it without , 
his consent!" 

"There's time for that later," 
the old man grinned. "Keep his 
eyes on you, Dr. Kalmar, while 
you build up his father image. Cut 
down on hostility, aggression and 
power drive. Boost social respon- 
sibility and advent urousness. But 
make su re he's I ooki n g at you 
constantly." 

"I won't allow it," said Mrs. 
Kalmar flatly. "You won't make 
my husband violate his oath." 

"I did it to him, didn't I?" Dr. 
Lowell replied jovially. "It got 
you a husband." 

Miss Dupont grabbed at Dr. 
Kalmar's hand, but he had al- 
ready turned on the current. 

"Anything else? " he asked. 

"Well, he has to get married, of 
course," Dr. Lowell said. "Let 
him look at Miss Dupont — she's 
scheduled for this year, isn't she? 
— while you give him a shot of 
mating urge. Now, wipe out the 
memory of this incident and put 
him on a joy jag. We can validate 
that by liquoring him up after- 



ward. When you're finished, bring 
him to." 

Dr. Hoyt came out of it almost 
with a whoop. He lurched out of 
the insulated seat, stared at Miss 
Dupont for a moment with eyes 
that almost glittered, and seized 
and kissed her. 

" My goodness! " she gasped. 

"Now, what were you saying 
about ethics?" Dr. Lowell asked. 

There was no answer. Both 
Miss Dupont and Mrs. Kalmar 
had frozen. 

"You drugged them, too?" Dr. 
Kalmar weakly wanted to know. 

"A bit slower-acting, " ad- 
mitted the old man. "All you 
have to do with them is wipe out 
the last half hour. Don't want 
any witnesses to an unethical act, 
you know. Oh, and put" them on a 
jag also." 

Dr. Kalmar followed instruc- 
tions. 

Finished, they left the three 
uproariously drunk in the waiting 
room and went to wash up. Dr. 
Kalmar went along bewilderedly. 
The old man was as unconcerned 
as if he did this sort of thing daily. 

"I was as arrogant and bel- 
ligerent as this squirt was?" 

"Worse," Dr. Lowell said. "He 
was willing to finish out his in- 
ternship. You weren't. Still wor- 
ried about the ethics?" 

"Yes. Naturally." 

"All right, apply some logic, 
then. Are you happier on Deneb 
than you'd have been on Earth?" 



60 



 



"Well, certainly. I'd have been 
lucky to get a job doctoring in a 
summer camp. I wouldn't trade a 
roomy planet like I his for the 
jammed cubicles of Earth. And I 
like our methods better than ter- 
restrial dogma. But those are my 
preferences. I can't inflict them on 
anybody else." 

"The hell they were your pref- 
erences. You bickered more about 
our methods and longed more 
loudly for the tenements of Earth 
than this lad ever did. All it took 
was a slight Ego Alter and you 
have a happier fife than you would 
have had. Right? " 

Dr. Kalmar felt his tension 
ease. If the old man said it was 
right, it was. He became momen- 
tarily resentful when he realized 
that that reaction had been in- 
stalled by Dr. Lowell, but then he 
smiled. Ft really was right. A bit 
arbitrary, perhaps, but for the 
good of Dr. Hoyt and Deneb in' 
the long run, just as it had been 
for himself. 

"Look," he said, drying his 
arms. "I've been wanting my 
wife to go through a slight 
rephysical." 

"Why don't you ask her?" 

"The fact is that I'm afraid 
she'll think I'm dissatisfied and I 
don't want her to get resentful." 

"Maybe she'd like you to do 
some changing, too." 

"What for? I'm all right." 

"She probably feels the same 
way about herself." 



'" But all I want are a few 
changes in her. She's as high as a 
space pilot now. It would be a 
cinch to — " 

Dr. Lowell flung down the 
towel and gave him an outraged 
glare. "There's such a thing as 
professional ethics, Dr. Kalmar!" 

"But you — " 

"That's different. It was a 
social decision, not a selfish one. 
I f you ask her and she agrees, 
that's up to her. But you can't 
take advantage of her in an ego- 
centric, arbitrary way. You just 
try it and I'll have you sent back 
to Earth." 

Dr. Kalmar felt his knees grow 
weak in alarm. "No, no. It's not 
that important. Just an insig- 
nificant kind of wish." 

And it was, he discovered when 
they went out to the wailing 
room. Unused to jags, Mrs. Kal- 
mar was more affectionate than 
she'd been since they were first 
married ; he'd have to remember 
to go on them periodically with 
her. Miss DuponL, unwilling lo 
budge out of Dr. Hoyt's i ight 
arms, had glassily joyous eyes. 
Dr. Hoyt didn't let her go until he 
caught sight of Dr. Kalmar. 

"Greatest doctor I ever met," 
he said enthusiastically. " Won'ful 
planet, Deneb. Just wanna marry 
Miss Dupont, stay here and learn 
at your feet. Okay?" 

Dr. Kalmar's glance at the old 
man was no less worshipful. "It 
couldn't be okayer," he said.

THE WAY HOME 




62 



By THEODORE STURGEON 



Paul was running away from home. Maybe someday he'd come 
back, covered with glory and a few scars. To a guy who rescues 
fair damsels from alligators, scars are badges of honor. 

Wait a minute. Paul didn't have scars; that was the young 
man who knew about women in Sacramento. Woman who rode 
around in expensive cars and ale chocolate-covered cherries 
. . . or was that some other woman? 

If you've the knack of remembering what it was like to be a 
small boy, how easy it was to get day-dreams and reality mixed 
until you weren't sure where one left off and the other began, 
then Theodore Sturgeon wrote this story especially for you! 



WHEN Paul ran away from 
home, he met no one and 
saw nothing alt the way to the 
highway. The highway swept sud- 
den and wide from the turn by 
Keeper's Rise, past the blunt end 
of the Township Road, and nar- 
rowed off to a distant pinpoint 
pricking at the horizon. After a 
time Paul could see the car. 

It was new and long and it 
threw down its snout a little as 
the driver braked, and when it 
stopped beside him it seesawed 
easily, once, on its big soft 
springs. 

The driver was a large man, 
large and costly, with a grey 
Stetson and a dove-colored top- 
coat made of something that did 
not crease in the bend of his arms 
but rolled and folded instead. The 
wnni.m beside him had ,1 broad 
brow and a pointed chin. Her skin 
had peach shadings, but was 
deeply tanned, and her hair was 



the red gold called "straw color" 
by a smith as he watches hTs 
forge. She smiled at the man and 
she smiled at Paul almost the 
same way. 

" Hi, son," the man said. " This 
the old Township Road?" 

"Yes sir," said Paul, "it sure 
is." 

" Figured it was," said the man. 
"A feller don't forget." 

" Reckon you don't," said Paul. 

"Haven't seen the old town in 
twenty years," said the man. "1 
guess it ain't changed much." 

"These old places don't change 
much/' said Paul with scorn. 

"Oh, they ain't so bad to come 
back to," said the man. "Hate to 
get chained down in one all my 
life, though." 

"Me too," agreed Paul. "You 
from around here?"" 

"Why sure," said the man. 
"My name's Roudenbush. Any 
more Roudenbushes around 



63 



here that you know of, boy?" 

"Place is full of 'em," said 
Paul. " Hey ! You're not the 
Roudenbush kid that ran away 
twenty years ago?" 

"The very one," said the man. 
"What happened after J left?" 

"Why, they talk about you to 
this day," said Paul. "Your 
mother sickened and died, and 
your pa got up in meetin' a month 
after you left an' asked forgiveness 
for treatin' you so mean." 

"Poor old feller," said the man. 
"I guess it was a little rough of 
me to run out like that. But he 
afiked for it." 

"I bet he did." 

"This is my wife," said the 
man. 

The woman smiled at Paul 
again. She did not speak. Paul 
could not think up what kind of a 
voice she might have. She leaned 
forward and opened up the glove 
compartment. It was cram full of 
chocolate-covered cherries. 

"Been crazy about these ever 
since I was a kid," said the man. 
"Help yourself. I got ten pounds 
of them in the back." He leaned 
into the leather cushions, took 
out a silver cigar case, put a cigar 
between his teeth, and applied a 
lighter that flamed up like a little 
bonfire in his hand. "Yes, sir," 
said the man. "J got two more 
cars back in the city, and a 
tuxedo suit with shiny lapels. 1 
made my killing in the stock mar- 
ket, and now I'm president of a 



railroad. I'll be getting back there 
I his evening, after 1 give the folks 
in the old town a treat." 

Paul had a handful of choco- 
late-covered cherries. "Gee," he 
said . After that he walked on 
down the highway. The cherries 
disappeared and the man and the 
lady and the car all disappeared, 
but that didn't matter. "It'll be 
like that," said young Paul Rou- 
denbush. " It'll be just like thai." 
Then, " I wonder what that lady's 
name'll be." 

A quarter of a mile down the 
pike was the turnoff to the 
school, and there was the railroad 
crossing with its big X on a pole 
which he alwa vs read R A 1 L 
CROSSING ROAD. The fore- 
noon freight was bowling down 
the grade, screaming two longa, a 
short, and a long. When he was a 
kid, two years or so back, Paul 
used to think it saluted him: Paul 
. . . Roud , . , n'Bush-h-h . . . with 
the final sibilant made visible in 
the plume of steam on the en- 
gine's iron shoulder. Paul trotted 
up to the crossing and stood just

boose. Caboose with a red flag 
fl>'' n f?> a °d a glimpse at _the 
window of a bull-necked trainman 
shaving, suds on his jowls like a 
mad dog. Then the train was a 
dwindling rectangle on the track, 
and on its top was the silhouette 
of a brakeman, leaning easily into 
wind and velocity, walking on 
top of the boxcars. 

With the train in one ear and 
dust in the other, Paul faced the 
highway. A man stood at the 
<p)ther side of the tracks. Paul 
gaped at him. 

He was wearing an old brown 
jacket with a grey sheepskin col- 
lar, and blue dungarees. These he 
was dusting off with long weather- 
beaten hands, one of which — the 
right — looked like a claw. There 
was no ring-finger or little finger, 
and a third of the palm's breadth 
was gone. From the side of the 
middle finger to the side ot the 
wrist, the hand was neatly sealed 



with a type of flexible silvery 
scar- tissue. 

He looked up from his dusting 
at Paul. " Hi, bub." Either he had 
a beard or he badly needed a 
shave. Paul could see the cleft in 
his square chin, though. The man 
had eyes as pale as the color of 
water poured into a glass after the 
milk had been drunk. 

Paul said *'Hi," still looking at 
the hand. The man asked him 
what that town was over there in 
the hollow, and Paul told him. He 
knew now what the man was — 
one of those fabulous characters 
who rides on freight trains from 
place to place. Rides the rods. 
Catch a fast freight out of Casey, 
which was K.C., which was Kan- 
sas City. They had been every- 
where and done everything, these 
men, and they had a language all 
their own. Handouts and line 
bulls, Chi and mulligan and grab 
a rattler to Nollins. 

The man squinched up his eyes

at the town, as if he were trying to 
drive his gaze through the hill and 
see more. "The old place hasn't 
growed none," he said, and spat. 

Paul spat too. "Never will," he 
said. 

"You from there?" 
*t Yupi" 

"Me loo," said the man sur- 
prisingly. 

"Gosh," said Paul. "You don't 
look like you came from around 
here." 

The man crossed the single 
track to Paul's side. "I guess I 
don't. I been a lot of places since I 
left here." 

"Where you been? " asked Paul. 

The man looked into Paul's 
open eyes, and through them to 
Paul's open credulousness. "AH 
over the world," he said. "All over 
this country on freights, and all 
over the oceans on ships." He 
bared his right forearm. "Look 
there." And sure enough he had a 
tattoo. 

"Women," said the man, flexing 
his claw so that the tattoo writhed. 
"That's what I like." He closed 
one pale eye, pushed his mouth 
sidewise under it, and clucked a 
rapid chick-chick from his pale 
cheek. 

Paul wet his lips, spat again, 
and said, "Yen. Oh boy." 

The man laughed. He had bad 
teeth. "You're like I was. Wasn't 
room enough in that town for 
me'' 

"Mc cither," said Paul. "I 



ain't- going back there no more." 

"Oh, you'll go back. You'll 
want to look it over, and ask a 
few questions around, and find out 
what happened to your old gals, 
and see how dead everything is, 
so's you can go away again knowin' 
you done right to leave in the first 
place. . . . This here's my second 
trip back. Seems like every time I 
go through this part o' the world I 
just got to drop by here and let the 
old burg give me a couple laughs. "* 
He turned his attention right 
around and looked outward again. 
" You really are headin' out, bub?" 

" Headin' out," nodded Paul. 
He liked the sound of that. " Headin' 
out." he said again. 

"Where you bound?" 

"The city," Paul said," unless 
1 hit somethin' I like better 'fore 
I get there." 

The man considered him. " Hey. 
Got any money?" 

Paul shook his head cautiously. 
He had two dollars and ninety- 
two cents. The man seemed to 
make some decision ; he shrugged. 
"Well, good luck, bub. More 
places you see, more of a man 
you'll be. Woman told me that 
once, in Sacramento." 

"Th — ohl" said Paul. Ap- 
proaching the grade crossing was 
a maroon coupe. "It's Mr. Sher- 
man!" 

"Who's he? " 

"The sheriff. He'll be out lookin' 
for me!" 



66 



 



"Sheriff! Me for the brush. 
Don't tag me, you little squirt ! Go 
the other way!" and he dived 
down the embankment and dis- 
appeared into the bushes. 

Frightened by the man's sud- 
den harshness, confused by the 
necessity for instant action, Paul 
shuffled for a moment, almost 
dancing, and then ran to the other 
side. Flat on his stomach in a 
growth of fire weed, he stopped 
breathing and peered at the road. 
The coupe slowed, all but stopped. 
Paul closed his eyes in terror. 
Then he heard the grate of gears 
and the rising whine as the car 
pulled over the tracks in second 
gear and moaned on up the high- 
way. 

Paul waited five minutes, his 
fear leaving him exactly as last as 
his sweat dried. Then he emerged 
and hurried along the highway, 
keeping a sharp watch ahead for 
the sheriff's returning car. He saw 
no sign of the man with the claw. 
But then, he hadn't really ex- 
pected to. 

It could be like that, he thought. 
Travel this old world over. Granips 
used to say that men like thai had 
an itching foot. Paul's feet itched 
a little, if he thought about it. 
Hurt a little, too. He could come 
back years from now with a tattoo 
and a mutilated hand. Folks'd 
really take notice. The stories he 
could tell! '*/ run down the bank, 
see, to haul this tomato out o' th' 
drink. She was yellin' her blonde 



head off. No sooner got my hooks on 
her when clomp! a alligator takes 
off part o' me hand, f didn't mind 
none. Not when I carried this babe 
up the bank." lie shut one eye, 
pushed his mouth sideways, and 
clucked. The sound, somehow, re- 
minded him of chocolate-covered 
cherries. . . . 

Another half-mile, and the coun- 
try became more open. He flicked 
his eyes from side to side as he 
trudged. First sign of that maroon 
coupe and he'd have to fade. 
"Sheriff! Me for the brush!" He 
felt good. He could keep ahead of 
the law. Bet your life. Go where 
you want to go, do what you want 
to do, come back for a laugh every 
once in a while. That was better, 
even, than a big car and a tuxedo 
suit. Women. A smooth-faced one 
in the car beside you or chick- 
chick! women all over. Sacramento 
and every place, to tell you what a 
man you are, because of all the 
places you've been. Yup; that was 
it. 

There was a deep drone from 
overhead. Paul looked up and saw 
the plane — one of the private 
planes that based at the airport 
forty miles away. Planes were no 
novelty, but Paul never saw one 
without an expressed wish that 
something would happen — not 
necessarily a crash, though that 
wouldn't be bad, but much rather 
something that would bring the 
plane down for a forced landing, so 



THE WAY HOME 



he could run over and see the 
pilot get out, and maybe talk to 
him or even help hi m fix the 
trouble. "Let me know next time 
you're at the field," the pilot 
would say. . . . 

Paul slowed, stopped, then went 
to the shoulder and sat down with 
his feet in the dry ditch. He 
watched the plane. It dipped a 
wing and circled, went off and 
came lower, made a run over the 
meadow. Paul thought he was go- 
ing to — well, of course he was 
going to land ! 

The wheels touched, kicked up 
a puff of yellow dust that whisked 
out of existence in the prop-wash. 
They touched again and held the 
earth; the tail came down, bounced 
a little, and then the plane was 
carrying its wings instead of being 
carried. The wings were orange 
and the fuselage was blue, and it 
was glossy in the sun. The wings 
wobbled slightly as the plane tax- 
ied over the lumpy meadow, and 
Paul knew that if he held out his 
arms and wobbled them like that 
he would feel it in his shoulders. 

The motor barked, and the pro- 
pellor-blades became invisible as 
the pilot braked one wheel and 
turned the ship in its own length. 
The propellor, in profile, was a 
ghostly band and then a glass disc 
as the plane swung toward Paul. 
It snorted and wobbled across the 
meadow until it was within twenty 
feet of the fence and the ditch. 
Then, with a roar, it swung broad- 



side to him and the sound of the 
motor dwindled to an easy pwap'-- 
tick-tickety-pwapf while the pilot 
did knowledgeable things at the 
controls. Paul could see him in 
there, plain as day, through the 
cabin doors. The plane was beau- 
tiful; standing still it looked as if it 
was going two hundred miles an 
hour. The windshield swept right 
back over the pilot's head. It was 
fine. 

The pilot opened the door and 
vaulted to the ground. "Glory be! 
You'd think they'd have a field 
built in town after all these 
years." 

"They never will," said Paul. 
"Nice job you got there." 

The pilot, pulling off a pair of 
high-cuffed gloves, looked briefly 
at the plane and grinned. He was 
very clean and had wide shoulders 
and practically no hips. He wore 
a good soft leather jacket and 
tight breeches. "Know anybody 
in town, son?" 

"Everybody, I guess." 

"Well, now. I can get all the 
news from you before I go on in." 

"Say — ain't you Paul Rouden- 
bush?" 

Paul froze. He hadn't said that. 
There were sudden icy cramps in 
the backs of his knees. The plane 
vanished. The pilot vanished. Paul 
sat with his feet in the dry ditch 
and slowly turned his head. 

A maroon coupe stood by the 
ditch. Its door was open, and 



68 



 



there, one foot on the running- 
board, was Mr. Sherman. Sheriff? 
Me for the brush! 

Instead, he licked his lips and 
said, "Hi, Mr. Sherman." 

" My," said Mr. Sherman, "you 
give me a turn, you did. Saw you 
sitting there so still, figured you'd 
been hit by a car or some such." 

" I'm all right," said Paul faintly. 
Me rose. Might as well get it over 
with. "I was just . . . thinkin', I 
guess." 

Thinking — and now he was 
caught, and the thoughts raced 
through him like the cars of the 
forenoon freight; thoughts from 
hot places, cold places, far places. 
Stock-market, car, claw claw plane. 
Women, women, cigarette-lighter, 
landing field. Thoughts that were 
real, thoughts that he made up; 
they barrelled on through him, 
with a roar and a swirl, and left 
him standing, facing the highway, 
and Mr. Sherman, who had caught 
him. 

"Thinking, eh? Well, I'm right 
relieved," said Mr. Sherman. He 
got back in the car, slammed the 
door, stepped on the starter. 

" Mr. Sherman — ain't you — " 

"Ain't I what, son?" 

"Notliin', Mr. Sherman. Nothin' 
at all." 

"You're a weird one," said Mr. 
Sherman, shaking his head. "Hey, 
I 'm heading back into town. Want 
a lift? It's near eating time." 

"No, thanks," said Paul imme- 
diately and with great sincerity. 



Paul watched the maroon coupe 
move off, his mind racing. The car 
was going into town. Without 
him. Mr. Sherihan did not know 
he was running away. Why not? 
Well, they hadn't missed him yet. 
Unless . . . unless they didn't 
care whether he came back or not. 
No. No, that couldn't be! The 
car would go right past his house, 
soon's it got in town. Wasn't much 
of a house. In it, though, was his 
own room. Small, but absolutely 
his own. 

The trouble with the other ways 
to go back, it took time to make a 
killing in the stock-market and 
get married. It took time to ac- 
quire a plane. It probably took 
quite a while to get part of your 
hand cut off. But this way — 

Suddenly he was in the road 
screaming, "Mr. Sherman! Mr. 
Sherman!" 

Mr. Sherman didn't hear him 
but he saw him in the rear-view 
mirror. He stopped and backed up> 
a bit. Paul climbed in, gasped his- 
thanks, and sat still, working on 
his wind. He got it all back just 
about the time they turned into 
the Township Road. 

Mr. Sherman glanced abruptly 
at the boy. "Paul." 

" Yessir." 

" I just had a thought. You, 
way out there on the pike; were 
you running away.' " 

Paul said "No." His eyes were 
more puzzled than anything else. 
" I was coming back," he said. 



THE WAY HOME 



TURNOVER POINT 



By ALFRED COPPEL 

Every era in history has had its Pop Ganlon's. Along 
in years and not successful and not caring much 
anyway. A matter of living out their years, following 
an obscure path to oblivion. 

It was that way in ancient Egypt, just as it will be 
when the Solar System shrinks to our size. And once 
in a while such men are given an opportunity to 
contribute to the society that has forgotten them. . . . 



Pop Ganxon was no hero — he 
was only a spaceman. A space- 
man and a father. In fact, Pop 
was rather no-account, even in a 
profession that abounded with 
drifters. He had made a meagre 
living prospecting asteroids and 



ltt*slTotar; BMSH

hauling light freight and an oc- 
casional passenger out in the Belt 
Region. Coffee and cakes, nothing 
more. Not many people knew Pop 
had a son in the Patrol, and even 
fewer knew it when the boy was 
blasted to a cinder in a back alley 
in Lower Marsport. 

Pop went on eating and breath- 
ing, but his life was over after 
that. He hit the bottle a little 
harder and his ship. The Luck, 
grew rustier and tackier, and 
those were the only outward signs 
that Pop Ganlon was a living 
dead man. He kept on grubbing 
among the cold rocks and pushing 
The Luck from Marsport to Cal- 
Hsto and back with whatever low- 
mass payloads he could pick up. 
He might have lived out his 
string of years like that, obscure 
and alone, if it hadn't been for 
John Kane. Kane was Pop Gan- 
lon's ticket to a sort of personal 
immortality — if there is such a 
thing for an old spaceman. 

It was in Yakki, down-canal 
from Marsport, that Kane found 
Pop. There is a small spacep* >r i 
there — a boneyard, really — for 
buckets whose skippers can't pay 
the heavy tariff imposed by the 
hig ramp. All the wrecks nest 
there while waiting hopefully for 
a pay load or a grubstake. They 
have all of Solis Lacus for a land- 
ing field, and if they spill it 
doesn't matter much. The drifting 
red sands soon cover up the scat- 
tered shards of dural and the slow. 



lonely life of Yakki goes on like 
before. 

The Patrol was on Kane's trail 
and the blaster in his hand was 
still warm when he shoved it up 
against Pop Ganlon's ribs and 
made his proposition. 

He wanted to get off Mars — 
out to Callisto. To Blaekwater, 
to Ley's Landing, it didn't matter 
too much. Just off M a rs, and 
quickly. His eyes had a metallic 
glitter and his hand was rock- 
steady. Pop knew he meant what" 
he said when he told him life was 
cheap. Someone else's life, not 
Kane's. 

That's how it happened that 
The Luck lifted that night from 
Yakki, outward bound for Ley's 
Landing, with Pop and Kane 
aboard her alone. 

Sitting at the battered console 
of The Luck, Pop watched his 
passenger. He knew Kane, of 
course. Or rather, he knew of him. 
A killer. The kind that thrives and 
grows fat on the frontiers. The 
bulky frame, the cropped black 
hair, the predatory eyes that 
looked like two blaster muzzles. 
They were all familiar to Pop. 
Kane was all steel and meanness. 
The kind of carrion bird that 
took what others bad worked for. 
Not big time, you understand. 
In another age he'd have been a 
torpedo — a hireling killer. But 
out among the stars he was work- 
ing for himself. And doing well. 



72 



 



Pop didn't care. His loyalty to 
the Patrol had stopped quite sud- 
denly not long before — in a dark 
alley in Lower Marsport. This 
was only a job, he told himself 
now. A job for coffee and cakes, 
and maybe a grubstake to work a 
few more lonely rocks. Life had 
become a habit for Pop, even if 
living had ended. 

"What are you staring at, 
Pop?" Kane's voice was like the 
rest of him. Harsh and cold as 
space itself. 

"At you, I guess," Pop said, 
*' I was wondering what you'd 
done — and where — and to 
whom." 

"You're a nosey old man," 
Kane said. "Just get me to Ley's 
Landing. That's what I'm paying 
for, not a thing more." 

Pop nodded slowly and turned 
back to the control board. They 
were above the Belt by now, and 
a few short hours from turnover 
point. The cranky drives of The 
Luck needed all his attention. 

Presently he said, " We'll be 
turning over soon. Want to get 
some rest? " 

Kane laughed. "No thanks, old 
man. I'll stay here and watch 
you." 

Pop eyed the ready blaster 
and nodded again. He wondered 
vaguely how it would feel to die 
under the blast of such a weapon. 
It couldn't be very painful. He 
hoped it wasn't painful. Perhaps 
the boy hadn't suffered. It would 



be nice to be sure, he thought. 

There wasn't much for Pop 
to remember about the boy. He'd 
never been one for writing many 
letters. But the District Patrol- 
man had come down to Yakki and 
looked Pop up — afterward. He'd 
said the boy was a good officer. 
A good cop. Died doing his job, 
and all that sort of thing. Pop 
swallowed hard. His job. What 
had 'his job' been that night in 
Lower Marsport, he wondered. 
Had someone else finished it for 
him? 

He remembered about that 
time hearing on the Mars Radio 
that a Triangle Post Office had 
been knocked over by a gunman. 
That might have been it. The Pa- 
trol would be after anyone knock- 
ing over EMV Triangle property. 
The Earth-Mars- Venus Govern- 
ment supported the Patrol for 
things like that. 

Pop guided The Luck skill- 
fully above the Belt, avoiding 
with practiced case the few er- 
rant chunks of rock that hurtled 
up out of the swarms. He talked 
to Kane because he was starved 
for talk — certainly not because 
he was trying to play Sherlock. 
Pop had long ago realized that he 
was no mental giant. Besides, he 
owed the Patrol nothing. Not a 
damned thing. 

"Made this trip often?" Pop 
tried to strike up a conversation 
with Kane. His long loneliness 
seemed sharper, somehow, more 



TURNOVER TOINT 



73 



poignant, when he actually had 
someone to talk to. 

"Not often. I'm no space pig." 
It was said with scorn. 

"There's a lot to spacing, you 
know," Pop urged. 

Kane shrugged. "I know easier 
ways to make a buck, old timer." 

"Like how?" 

"A nosey old man, like I said," 
Kane smiled. Somehow, the smile 
wasn't friendly. ' ' Okay, Pop, 
since you ask. Like knocking off 
wacky old prospectors for their 
dust. Or sticking up sandcar cara- 
vans out in Syrtis. Who's the 
wiser? The red dust takes care of 
the leftovers." 

Pop shook his head. "Not for 
me. There's the Patrol to think 
of." 

Kane laughed. " Punks. Bell- 
boys. They'd better learn to shoot 
before they leave their school- 
books." 

Pop Ganlon frowned slightly. 
"You talk big, mister." 

Kane's eyes took on that metal- 
lic glitter again. He leaned for- 
ward and threw a canvas packet 
on the console. It spilled crisp 
new EMV certificates. Large ones. 
"I take big, too," he said. 

Pop stared. Not at the money. 
It was more than he had ever seen 
in one pile before, but it wasn't 
that that shook him. It was the 
canvas packet. It was marked : 
Postal Service, EMV. Pop sud- 
denly felt cold, as though an icy 
wind had touched him. 



"You . . . you killed a Patrol- 
man for this," he said slowly. 

' ' That's right, Pop," grinned 
Kane easily. "Burned him down 
in an alley in Lower Marsport. 
It was like taking candy from a 
baby. ..." 

Pop Ganlon swallowed hard. 
"Like taking candy from a . . . 
baby. As easy as that. ..." 

"As easy as that, old man," 
Kane said. 

Pop knew he was going to die 
then. He knew Kane would blast 
him right after turnover point, 
and he knew fear. He felt some- 
thing else, too. Something that 
was new to him. Hate. An icy 
hate that left him shaken and 
weak. 

So the boy's job hadn't been 
finished. It was still to do. 

There was no use in dreaming of 
killing Kane. Pop was old. Kane 
was young — and a killer. Pop 
was alone and without weapons — 
save The Luck. . . . 

Time passed slowly. Outside, 
the night of deep space keened 
soundlessly. The stars burned 
bright, alien and strange. It was 
time, thought Pop bleakly. Time 
to turn The Luck. 

"Turnover point," he said 
softly. 

Kane motioned with his blaster. 
"Get at it." 

Pop began winding the fly- 
wheel. It made a whirring sound 
in the confined space of the tiny 



74 



 



control room. Outside, the night 
began to pivot slowly. 

"We have to turn end-for-end," 
Pop said. That way we can de- 
celerate on the drop into Callisto. 
But, of course, you know all 
about that, Mr. Kane." 

"I told you I'm no space pig," 
Kane said brusquely. " I can 
handle a landing" and maybe a 
takeoff, but the rest of it 1 leave 
for the boatmen. Like you. Pop." 

Pop spun the flywheel in si- 
lence, listening to the soft whir. 
Presently, he let the wheel slow 
and then stop. He straightened 
and looked up at Kane. The 
blaster muzzle was six inches from 
his belly. He swallowed against 
the dryness in his throat. 

"You . . . you're going to kill 
me," Pop said. It wasn't a ques- 
tion. Kane smiled, showing white 
teeth. 

"I ... I know you are," Pop 
said unsteadily. "But first, I want 
to say something to you." 

"Talk, old timer," Kane said. 
"But not too much." 

"That boy — that boy you 
killed in Marsport. He was my 
son," Pop said. 

Kane's face did not change ex- 
pression. "Okay. So what?" 

Pop's Hps twitched. "I just 
wanted to hear you say it." He 
looked at the impassive face of 
the killer. "You made a mistake, 
Mr. Kane. You shouldn't have 
done that to my boy." 

"Is that all?" 



Pop nodded slowly. "I guess 
that's all." 

Kane grinned. " Afraid, old 
man ?" 

"I'm a space pig," Pop said. 
"Space takes care of its own." 

"You're in a bad way, old 
timer," Kane said, "and you 
haven't much sense. I'm doing 
you a favor." 

Pop lifted his hands in an in- 
stinctive gesture of futile protec- 
tion as the blaster erupted flame. 

There was a smell in the control 
room like burnt meat as Kane 
holstered his weapon and turned 
the old man over with a foot. 
Pop was a blackened mass. Kane 
dragged him to the valve and jet- 
tisoned the body into space. 

Alone among the stars, The 
Luck moved across the velvet 
night. The steady beat of flame 
from her tubes was a tiny spark of 
man-made vengeance on the face 
of the deeps. 

From her turnover point, she 
drove outward toward the spin- 
ning Jovian moons. For a short 
while she could be seen from the 
EMV Observatory on Callisto, 
but very soon she faded into the 
outer darkness. 

Much later, the Observatory at 
Land's End on Triton watched 
her heading past the gibbous mass 
of Pluto — out into the inter- 
stellar fastnesses. 

The thrumming of the jets was

BELLY LAUGH 



By IVAR JORGENSEN 

You hear a lot of talk these days about secret weapons. If it's not 
a new wrinkle in nuclear fission, it's a gun to shoot around corners 
and down winding staircases. Or maybe a nice new strain of bacteria 
guaranteed to give you radio-active dandruff. Our own suggestion is 
to pipe a few of our television commercials into Russia and bore the 
enemy to death. 

Well, it seems that Ivar Jorgensen has hit on the ultimate engine 
of destruction: a weapon designed to exploit man's greatest weakness. 
The blueprint can be found in the next few pages; and as the soldier 
in the story says, our only hope is to keep a sense of humor! 



ME? I'm looking for my outfit. 
Cot cut off in th.it Holland 
Tunnel attack. Mind if I sit down 
with you guys a while? Thanks. 
Coffee? Damn! This is heaven. 
Ain't seen a cup of coffee in a year. 

What? You said it! This sure is 
a hell of a war. Tough on a guy's 
feet. Yeah, that's right. Holland 



Tunnel skirmish. Where the Rusk- 
ies used that new gun. Uhuh. God ! 
It was awful. Guys popping off all 
around a guy and him not know- 
ing why. No sense to it. No noise. 
No wound. Just popping off. 

That's the trouble with this 
war. It won't settle down to a rou- 
tine. Always something new. What 



77 



the hell chance has a guy got to 
figure things out? And I tell you 
them Ruskies are coming up with 
new weapons j ust as fast as we are. 
Enough to make your hair stand 
on end. 

Sugar? Christ, yes! Ain't seen 
sugar for a year. You see, it's like 
this: we were bottled up in the pits 
around the Tunnel for seven damn 
days. It was like nothing you ever 
saw before. Oops — sorry. Didn't 
mean to splash you. I was laugh- 
ing about something that hap- 
pened there — to a guy. Maybe 
you guys would get a kick out of 
it. After all, we got to keep our 
sense of humor. 

' You sec, there was me and a 
Kentucky kid named Stillwell in 
this pit — a pretty big pit with 
lots of room — and we were all 
alone. This Stillwell was a nice kid 
— green and lonesome and it's 
pretty sad, really, but there's a 
yak in it, and — as I say — we got 
to keep a sense of humor. 

Well, this Stillwell --a really 
green kid — is unhappy and just 
plain . drooling for his gal back 
home. He talks about his mother, 
of course, and his old man, but it's 
the girl that's really on his mind as 
you guys can plainly understand. 

He's seeing her every place — 
like spots in front of his eyes — 
nice spots doing things to him, 
when this Ruskie babe shows up. 

My gun came up without any 
orders from me just as she poked 
her puss over the edge of the pit, 



and — huh? Oh, thank you kindly. 
It sure tastes good but I don't 
want to short you guys. Thank 
you kindly. 

Well, as I was saying, this Ruskie 
babe pokes her nose over the edge 
of the pit and Stillwell dives and 
knocks down my gun. He says, 
"You son-of-a-bitch ! " Just like 
that. Wild and desperate, like 
you'd say to a guy if the guy was 
just kicking over the last jug of 
water on a desert island. 

It would have been long enough 
for her to kill us if I hadn't had 
good reflexes. Even then, all I had 
time to do was knock the pistol 
out of her hand and drag her into 
the pit. 

With her play bollixed, she was 
confused and bewildered. She ain't 
a fighter, and she sits back against 
the wall staring at us dead pan 
with big expressionless eyes. She's 
a plenty pretty babe and I could 
see exactly what had happened as 
far as Stillwell was concerned. His 
spots had come to life in very ade- 
quate form so to speak. 

Stillwell goes over and sits down 
beside her and I'm very much on 
the alert, because I know where 
his courage comes from. But I de- 
cide it's all right, because I see the 
babe is not belligerent, just con- 
fused kind of. And friendly. 

And willing. Kind of a whipped- 
littlc-dog willing, and man oh man ! 
She was sure what Stillwell needed. 

They kind of went together like 



78 



 



a hand and a glove — natural-like. 
And it followed — pretty natural 
— that when StiUwell got up and 
led her around a wing of the pit, 
out of sight, she went willing — 
like that same little dog. 

Uhuh. No, you guys. Two's 
enough. I wouldn't rob you. Well, 
okay, and thanks kindly. 

Well, there I was, all alone, but 
happy for StiUwell, cause I know 
it's what the kid needs, and in 
spots like that what difference 
does it make? Yank — Ruskie — 
Mongolian — as long as she's will- 
ing. 

Then, you guys, StiUwell comes 
back out — wall-eyed — real wall- 
eyed — like being hit but not 
knocked out and still walking. I 
know what it is — some kind of 
shock. I get up and walk over and 
take a look at the babe where he'd 
left her — and I bust out laugh- 
ing, I told you guys there was a 
yak in this. I laughed like a fool — 



it was that funny. As much as I 
had time to, before StiUwell cracked. 
It was enough to crack him — the 
lit tle thing that pushes a guy over 
the edge. 

He lets out a yell and screams, 
"For crisake! For crisake! Noth- 
ing but a bucket of bolts! Nothing 
but a couple of plastic lumps — " 

That was when I hit him. 1 had 
to. He was for the birds, StiUwell 
was. An hour later we got relievo 1 
and a couple of medicos carried 
him away strapped to a stretcher 
— gone like a kite. 

They took the robot too, and its 
clothes, but they forgot the bras- 
siere, so I took it and 1 been carry- 
ing it ever since, but I'll leave it 
with you guys if you want — for 
the coffee. Might make you think 
about home. After all, like the 
man says, we got to keep our 
sense of humor. 

Well, so long, you guys — and 
thanks. 



^ai.k about women not being ahle to make up their minds. Look at old 
Mother Earth, she goes in eight different directions at one time: 

(1) She revolves around the sun with a speed of alxmt 19 miles a second 

(2) She rotates upon her own axis at about 500 yards per second 

(3) She participates in the sun's forward motion in the direction of Vega, 
the stationery star 

(4) The gravitational influence of the moon gravitates her 

(5) She is part of the solar system's rotary motion upon its axis 

(6) She takes part in the solar system's revolution around a common 
center of gravity 

(7) She swings from the poles toward the equator 

(8) And she has some responsibility for the precession of the equinoxes 
which is caused by the attraction of the sun and moon on the ring of 
heavy matter which forms the equatorial protuberance of the Earth.

THERE BE TYGERS 



By RAY BRADBURY 

If you are wondering why we're presenting this particular story by 
Ray Bradbury, here's the reason. A new one we had counted on ju it 
didn't come through after we'd put his name on the cover. It meant 
we had to reprint one of his best — or drop him out entirely. More 
than likely you haven't read this one before anyway . . . and lake 
it from us he has never done better. 

We'd rather not tell you anything about it here. Ray's fiction 
is always far more than plot. Much of its charm and value is found 
m the magic of his style — a style which has made his work unique

You'll never come back." Hell- 
man pared his fingernails 
casually. "Something frightening 
will happen to you, something vile 
and terrible. Remember the other 
expeditions. My God, the first 
Mars rocket killed off by halluci- 
nations, the Weckner- Venus party 
baked alive, I hear." Hellman 
gestured to a three-dimensional 
map which hung like a dark mo- 
bile in the center of his parlor. 
Glittering planets floated there 
in a black void. "It's a hobby of 
mine,'' he said. "You see the tiny 
rocket ships there, on each tiny 
planet? I keep track, just like the 
government. When a particular 

Henry llott and Company jw 



rocket fails to return from some 
horrible world or other, I sim- 
ply — " He twitched his hand del- 
icately, wrist-deep, into the silent 
depths of the map. " — toss the 
rocket into the waste-basket." 
Something like a silver seed 
tinkled from his fingers into the 
basket. "And turn off the light 
in that one tiny world." Click. A 
planet stopped gleaming in the 
small night. "Another world in- 
vestigated and found wanting, 
another multi-mi lliou-dollar ex- 
pedition down the cosmic drain. 
No, my dear Forester, you'll 
never come back alive. Look. I've 
numbered this tiny new little 
rocket A-1000 for you and your 
men. You're traveling off to 
Planet 4 of Star System 70, right? 
Well, here's Planet 4; I'll switch 
it on for you. There. And one 
year from tonight, when you don't 
show up, I'll switch it off again 
and throw this little rocket of 
yours into the incincerator. Good- 
bye forever, dear friend." 

1 lellman smiled knowingly as 
he released the tiny needle-rocket 
at the rim of the dark galaxy. 
The rocket flew quietly into space 
leaving Hellman, the cynic, far 
behind. . . - 

"That's it," said Forester. 

He nodded out the port and the 
men looked with him at the beau- 
tiful globe of soil and sea and for- 
est and cloud that swung up un- 
der their rocket. A month had 



passed, they had slept most of it 
away in the hypnotic machines 
and now, like children freshly 
wakened for their morning exer- 
cises, they waited for their ship 
to touch Planet Four in Star 
System 70. 

"I keep thinking about what 
Hellman said." The man next to 
Forester rubbed his chin. "Will 
we come through this alive?" 

Forester laughed. "Yes. Be- 
cause we're US. I always feel that 
way, don't you? Bad things al- 
ways happen to other people, not 
to us, not to me. I'll live forever." 

"A comforting but hardly lexi- 
cal thought when one Is impaled 
on a rhino-carpis." 

"Rhino-carpis?" 

"A terrible beast my father 
made up when I was a boy. He 
always said he'd throw me to the 
rhino-carpisses if I wasn't good," 

The men laughed quietly. They 
gazed at the planet which rose 
softly to touch the ship. The auto- 
matic landing units functioned 
like the oiled machinery of a 
Swiss typewriter. 

"Ours is a funny policy when 
you think of it," said Koestler, 
the radiologist. "We send rockets 
to each new world. If the. rockets 
fail to return, we never send a 
second one to check the reason 
why. There are so many worlds 
we can't waste time on a hostile 
one, fighting futile wars, subduing 
natives; problems of logistics and 
all that." 



 



"A very sensible policy," said 
Forester. "Each rocket represents 
two years of time, ten million 
dollars, and God knows what in 
human lives, the years it took to 
educate us all. No use throwing 
us out with the bath-water, eh?" 

"And yet," replied Koestler, 
"I can't stop wondering-. What 
happened to all those rockets on 
all those worlds we never went 
back to check on a second time? 
Oh, we know what happened on 
Mars, the men were killed. We 
had to go baclc there, it was an 
operational base. But what of all 
those lost expeditions on worlds 
we'll never try again?" 

"Simple. The men either 
crashed, or were burned by na- 
tives, shot, stabbed, or broiled 
for supper." 

"Why must we talk this way a 
moment before we step out on a 
new planet, with God-knows-what 
waiting for us?" A third man 
moved forward between them. 

"Right, Driscoll." Forester 
turned. "Let's get into our equip- 
ment. Going ashore in five min- 
utes." 

The men walked off. 

Only Forester remained behind 
for a moment at the crystal port 
staring out at the green world of 
grass and lakes. *'WelI," he whis- 
pered to himself, "what if Hell- 
man was right? " 

Driscoll held a handful of yel- 
low flowers out before him. " Here 

HERE THERE BE TYGERS 



are your rhino-carpisses, Koest- 
ler!" 

Koestler eyed the distant for- 
est. "We've only been walking a. 
few minutes. No telling, they may 
have guillotines set up in the 
woods, and oil-vats to boil us in." 

The men loosened their guns in 
their creaking holsters. 

They walked forward through 
open fields of clover, coming to 
no highway or fence or building. 
They walked under a mellow sun 
and there was a mellow wind 
blowing all about. 

"Ho-ho!" said Driscoll, stand- 
ing at the top of a little rise. 

The others glanced at him. 

" I was just thinking. Feel." 
Driscoll held his arms out loosely. 
"Feel how the wind is. Remem- 
ber when you were a kid? Remem- 
ber how you used to run and how 
the wind felt? Like feathers 
around your arms. You thought 
you could fly. You ran and you 
thought any moment you'd fly, 
my God, you'd' ve given your 
right arm to fly. But you never 
quite did." 

The men stood remembering. 
There was an aspect to the day 
that encouraged such remember- 
ing. The smells of pollen and weed 
and some distant and delicious- 
fruit, a smell of new rain drying 
upon a million blades of grass. 

Driscoll gave a little run. "Feel 
it, by God. The wind. You know, 
we never have really flown. For 
all our science we have to fit our- 

83 



selves into blundering big" planes 
and jets'and rockets, tons of junk 
and trickery. But what I mean is 
the simple thing i tself, flying 
alone, flying with nothing but 
your arms, flying like a bird. The 
thing you felt twenty years back. 
When you were so high, just to 
put your arms out like this." He 
extended his arms. "And run." 
He began to run ahead of them, 
laughing at his own idiocy. "And 
fly!" he cried. 
He flew. 

Time passed on the silent gold 
wrist watches of the men standing 
below. Five minutes ticked by. 
They shielded their eyes from the 
sun. They stared up. They seemed 
to be watching some high sport, 
some shuttlecock in the air, lumi- 
nous and changing. They turned 
their gaze in six directions. And 
from the air came a high sound of 
almost unbelievable laughter. 

At last, Driscoll flew down. 

He landed at their feet, tears 
of laughter and disbelief rolling 
from his blue eyes. "Did you see 
me! My God, did you see! I flew! 
For God's sake, I flew! Did you 
see it?" 

They had seen. They had 
watched him soaring higher and 
higher into a blue sky to dive and 
flip about like a boy rollicking on 
a blue mattress. 

"Let me sit down. Lord, oh 
Lord." He gasped and slapped 
his knees, chuckling. He made a 



twittering motion of his fingers. 
"I'm a sparrow, I'm a robin, I'm 
a hawk, damn it! Go on, all of 
you! Try it!" 

' ' What happened ? ' ' Forester 
knelt beside him. 

" It's the wind, that's what it is. 
I didn't do a thing but think I 
wanted to fly. I ran, and next 
thing I knew the wind picked me up 
and there I was in the air. Scared 
the hell out of me. But then I 
knew I couldn't fall. The wind 
wouldn't let me." 

"What do you think? " Forester 
glanced at the other men. "Shall 
we go back to the rocket and get 
out of here? " 

"Get out of here?" cried Dris- 
coll, sobering, but still amused. 
"Why? It's perfect. You can have 
your rockets. I can fly, by God, 
better than any jet in the uni- 
verse, and to hell with rockets 
and planes." 

The men shuffled their feet. 
They gazed at the great soft area 
of sky waiting to be jumped upon 
in coiled-spring abandon; there 
was the vast and serene play- 
ground, and the wind whistling 
over their ears, calling to them. 

"It's all right," said Driscoll. 
"You're too suspicious." 

"In the interests of science, let's 
experiment," said Chatterton, the 
anthropologist, drily. 

Forester examined his arms, 
frowning. He put them out on the 
warm-cool air. The wind wavered 
and trembled the cloth, sighing, 



84 



 



whispering. There was a kite 
sound in the air, a humming as 
of strings and paper, a sound of 
eternal March. 

"How did you do it, Driscoll?" 

Driscoll considered. "I ran. I 
put up my arms. And then." He 
hesitated. "I asked the wind." 

"Oh, come off it!" 

"I did. And it flew me, Lord, 
like a feather!" 

"All right." Forester waved 
the others back. "I'll take a 
chance. If I'm killed, if I fall, 
back to the ship, all of you." 

He took a deep breath. "Now, 
once more, Driscoll?" 

"Run." 

"I feel like an idiot." 

"Run faster. That's it. Faster!" 

He ran. 

"Now, put up your arms." 

He put up his arms. 

"Now, ask the wind to give you 
a sail, go on!" 

Forester's lips trembled. 

Everyone shouted and looked 
up. 

"There he goes," said Driscoll, 
seated on the ground. 

It was twilight. 

The men sat on the hilltop, ex- 
hausted and laughing. 

"Well, that's all of us!" 

"Everyone had his turn!" 

"God, isn't it perfect?" 

"It's the thing!" 

They had flown in duos, trios, 
quartettes, in squadrons. They 
had flown like orioles or eagles or 



sparrows, each according to his 
body weight and agility. But they 
were all happy. 

"That's it, exactly." Driscoll 
put a hand up to feel the smile on 
his face, as if it were a strange 
mask. "Now I know what it is. 
I'm happy. I haven't been this 
happy in a good fifteen years." 

One of the men came running 
up, jumping, half-flying, with can- 
teens in his arms. "Hey, I found 
a creek! Best darned water you 
ever drank!" 

Forester accepted a can teen. 
"Did you test it?" 

"It's tested and pure." 

The men passed the canteens 
from hand to hand, pressing them 
to their parched and exhausted 
mouths. 

Forester splashed some of the 
stuff into his palm and sniffed. 
"Wine," he said. 

" It can't be." 

' ' Smell it. Taste it. White 
wine." 

The man who had fetched it 
gave a hoot. "Right! I followed 
the creek up." 

" It can't be." 

"No, it's real. I found the forest 
where the creek starts. A big 
place with trees so thick you can't 
get in, and a ton of berries on each 
tree. The berries fall like snow, all 
the time. As soon as some fall, 
others grow. And the berries get 
caught in a kind of floe there, so 
heavy that the ones on the bottom 
are crushed out and the fluid is 



HERE THERE BE TYGERS 



85 



caught in a kind of stone quarry 
there. They ferment by them- 
selves. Maybe there're yeast 
spores in it. Hell, who knows? By 
the time it flows down here in a 
creek, it's wine," 

"French domestic. ' ' Driscoll 
sipped his. 

"Go easy on it," warned For- 
ester. 

They passed the canteens twice 
more around. 

"Well," said Forester at last. 
"Time to break this up and build 
a camp. Or should we sleep in the 
ship tonight? " 

"Neither," said Driscoll. "We 
can sleep out here on the ground. 
We don't need a camp or a fire to 
keep warm. Feel that air. It's 
going to be eighty-six degrees 
warm all night long. We'll sleep 
like babes." 

"But out in the open . . ." 

"We'll post a guard, of course." 

Everyone nodded, happily, 
drowsily. 

"Break out the supper rations." 

' ' Captain Forester. ' ' Chatter- 
ton came floating up, sublime and 
ridiculous in his new element. 
"Supper's waiting for us yonder. 
Have a look." 

The men walked half down the 
hill and then remembering that 
they could fly, flew. They landed 
where a small stream jumped into 
a bubbling pool of boiling water. 
The men stood about the pool 
rim waiting. Moments later four 



fish, weighing five pounds each, 
swam along the cold creek and 
fell, glittering and wriggling, down 
through the interior of the hot 
spring. They floated to the top of 
the spring a minute later, cooked. 
Chatterton fished them out with 
a net. 

"What did you say about sup- 
per, Captain?" 

There were twenty varieties of 
fruit for dessert. After supper, the 
warriors of the rocket lay stuffed 
while their captain philosophized. 

"I am still suspicious." 

"No, Captain." 

"To quote an old map, one I 
saw when I was studying medie- 
val history, time of Columbus, 
the map said, 'Here there be ty- 
gers.' Well, where are the tigers, 
where are the lions, the meat-eat- 
ers, where the cannibals and the 
missionary kettles aboil?" 

"It was a miracle! " said Koest- 
lef. "There were the trees, green, 
but no fruit on them. And I asked 
the trees and they grew fruit and 
dropped it on the grass." 

"We are all a little drunk." 

"Hardly that. It's simply that 
this planet is alive. The soil is a 
living flesh. It's a race unto itself, 
and what a race, what a people 
it is! The trees have no special 
season except the season of our 
minds. The season of thinking, 
the season of hunger. If we should 
go away, there would be a long 
winter, but on our return the trees 
would summer again and there'd 



86 



 



be food. And the wind's alive. Why 
not? It's molecules and atoms, 
isn't it? So it has a soul, it lives, 
it thinks, it can soar us about. Is 
that unusual? Not to a truly de- 
vout thinker; a rarity itself today. 
Life itself is a damned miracle. 
I've never gotten over thinking 
about it." 

Koestler patted the grass at his 
side with tender curiosity. "Why, 
I bet you if you asked the grass 
to grow and blanket you at night 
to keep you warm, it would. Ex- 
cept we won't have to do that. 
We'll just ask the wind to blow 
summer breezes and it will, all 
night." 

Now, softly, a great and gentle 
rain began to fall upon the green 



world. It was a rain of serenity 
and peace. They could hear it 
touch a billion times upon the 
nearby trees and grass blades. 

"The final touch," said Dris- 
coll. "We'll never have to build 
houses here on this planet." 

"Why not?" 

"It's raining, stupid, but you 
notice it's not raining on us. It's 
raining all around, all around, on 
every side, but where we are, it 
never rains. It rains ahead of us, 
it rains after we pass. Even the 
rain has a season of the mind, has 
a courtesy and a respect for us. 
This is a very kind world, gentle- 
men." 

"I don't believe that about the 
rain," murmured some one. "I 
believe the other things, yes, but 



HERE THERE HE TYGEKS 



87 



1 don't believe that." 

"I'll prove it." Driscoll jumped 
up, swaying just a trifle, chuck- 
ling, and walked straight out into 
the downpour. He stood with his 
arms out. The rain did not touch 
him. When he returned, he was 
dry. Everyone felt. of his uniform. 

"On the other hand," he said. 
"Watch." He stripped^off his uni- 
form. Probing among his supplies, 
he walked out into the storm with 
a bar of green soap. He looked up 
as if addressing the million drops 
of water and said, " Now, I'll have 
some, thank you." 

The rain drenched hrm. 

He stood singing a song, lather- 
ing his body, having it washed off, 
lathering and rcwashing himself, 
again and again. 

The rain was gone. The moon 
was rising over the freshened hills. 

"There's only one more thing," 
said Kocstler. 

"Yes," said everyone. 

They looked at the forest and 
beyond. 

They waited. 

"It doesn't work," said Dris- 
coll. "I've been thinking very 
hard, but that's different. I .think 
we'll have to go looking." 

"Let's be logical." Koestler lit 
a cigarette. "If you ask for the 
wind to fly you and you ask for 
the trees to feed you, and you 
ask for the rain to bathe you, and 
everything is obediently alive, 
then, with any sort of logic at all, 



one need only ask this world for 
the bounty of feminine compan- 
ionship." 

" I've thought a long time," 
said Chatterton. "We're all bach- 
elors. The Service won ' t take 
married men. So here we are, men 
who've been up and down the 
system to the colonized planets 
for five or six years, hit every port. 
I'm tired of that. I want to settle 
down." He saw the others nod. 
"Wouldn't it be nice to . . . well 
. . . get married, and settle here? 
Do you realize how simple life 
could be? What do we do on 
Earth? We work like hell all our 
lives just to save enough to buy a 
house. We pay taxes. The cities 
stink of gasoline and exhaust 
fumes. Here, you don't even need 
a house, the weather is perfect all 
the time. If it gets monotonous 
you can ask for rain and clouds 
and changes, but you don't \iave 
to be uncomfortable." 

"By God, you're right. Takes 
half a man's income half his life 
just to buy a home or car, and feed 
his face, on Earth." 

"Who needs cars? Who worries 
about fueling the wind here, or 
checking its transmission and tires 
and oil?" 

The men laughed. 

"But you need houses, for pri- 
vacy." 

"Live in the forest." 

"Right. And we won't have to 
work for food, it's here, wine, 
fruits, vegetables, cooked fish. 



88 



 



I'm tempted." 

*' It's dangerous," said Forester. 
"You get soft. Look at the South 
Sea islanders, where did they ever 
get? What did they ever do? Life 
was so easy for them, they had to 
make up a tattoo ritual that was 
so terrifying it was the main event 
of their lives. Life was so boring, 
they had to cook up a trick thing 
like hurling themselves on pur- 
pose to keep the race on its feet. 
That would happen here, too, 
to us." 

"I'm not afraid of that," said 
Chatterton. "This is a versatile 
planet, Captain. We're sitting on 
the bald dome of Plato, and the 
shaved head of Caesar, combined. 
What was it you said awhile back 
— 'Here there be tygers" Well, if 
life should ever soften too much, 
we need only repeat that phrase 
a bit, 'Here there be tygers. Here 
there be tygers.' and listen. . . 

Far away, wasn't there the 
faintest roar of a giant cat, hidden 
in the deep night forest? 

The men shivered and turned 
to each other, smiling. 

" Don't worry about this planet, 
Captain, it'll take care of itself." 

"There's only one thing makes 
me sad," said Driscoll. 

"What's that?" 

"Suppose there are people here, 
suppose their women are beauti- 
ful, suppose we meet them, and 
everything is agreeable. Then we 
go home and tell everyone on 



Earth and everyone rushes here 
to the Happy Hunting Ground to 
ruin it. Lord, they'd tramp hell 
out of it, you know they would!" 

"Yes," said everyone, scowling, 
thinking of it. 

"That's right." 

"The brow of Plato, remem- 
ber," said Chatterton. "Give this 
planet credit for some sense. To a 
few men it presents its versatile 
and sunny face. To an invasion of 
ten million men? What would 
they find? A muck-bog, a swamp, 
a fog world infested with sixty 
trillion mosquitoes, and ten bil- 
lion dinosaurs, not worth bother- 
ing with." He slapped the earth 
under his feet. "Good old wise 
planet!" 

Everyone nodded and lay down 
to sleep. 

"Good night." 

"Good night." 

" Did you notice, after you 
drank so much of the wine, you 
didn't want any more? Just 
en ough to ma ke y o u mildly 
happy." 

"A world of moderation." 

"Good night." 

They lay with their eyes open. 
They lay listening to something 
like a great heart of earth beating 
slowly and warmly under their 
bodies. One by one they shut their 
eyes until only Forester lay awake, 
watching the stars. It's a trifle 
warm, he thought. 

A cool breeze fanned his head. 

I'm thirsty, he thought. 



11 ERE THERE BE TYGEKS 



S9 



A drop of rain splashed on his 
mouth. 

He laughed quietly. 
I'm lonely, he thought. 

Distantly, he heard voices; soft 
high voices. 

He turned his eyes in upon a 
vision. There was a group of hills 
from which flowed a clear river, 
and in the shallows of that river, 
sending up spray, white and swift 
themselves, with flowing hair, 
their faces bubbled and shimmer- 
ing, were the beautiful women. 

They played like children on 
the banks. And it came to Forester 
to know about them and their life. 
They were nomads. They roamed 
over the face of this planet as was 
their desire. There were no cities 
or houses, there were no highways, 
there were only forests and hills 
and valleys and plains. There 
were no machines, only winds to 
carry them like white feathers 
where they wished. As Forester 
asked the questions, some in- 
visible answerer chimed the an- 
swers. Are they women? They are 
women. Where are the men? 
There are no men. These women 
produce their race, alone. The 
men died out on this world fifty 
thousand years ago. And where 
are these women now? A mile 
down from the green forest, a 
mile over on the wine creek by 
the six white stones, and a third 
mile to the large river. There, at 
the shallows, are the women, who 



will make fine wives, and raise 
beautiful children. 

Forester opened his eyes. At 
that instant a tiny scattering of 
rain fell upon the sleeping men, a 
gesture, it almost seemed, to 
waken them. Their eyes were 
open, brightly, and they were 
sitting up. 

" I had a dream." 
"So did U" 
"And me." 
"And me." 

They sat for a Jong moment. 
They looked toward the rocket. 
"What about it? What about 
Earth?" 

They stood up without a word 
and began to collect their gear. 
Forester walked back to the rocket 
and kicked its hull contempla- 
tively, slowly. Driscoll came up 
behind him. "Well, Captain?" 

"We'll leave her here." 

" I say dismantle her." 

"Why?" 

"So we can never go back. So 
no one will ever know what hap- 
pened to us. So they'll never come 
and investigate and spoil this 
beautiful place." They waited. 
"What do you say?" 

"You're right. We'll dismantle 
the rocket tomorrow. But now, 
tonight — " 

" You afraid, sir?" 

"No." 

"You dream the same as 1 
did?" 

They were back among the men 



90 



 



now. "Yes. A mile down from the 
green forest . . ." 

". . .a mile over on the wine 
creek. . . ." recited Chatterton. 

". . . by the six white stones," 
said Koestler. 

"And a third mile to the large 
river," said all the men, in a 
ragged, self-conscious chorus. 

Someone tossed down their 
gear. "What do I want with that? 
To heck with it, I won't need it." 

The other men threw down 
their equipment, too. 

"Shall we walk or fly, Cap- 
tain?" asked Driscoll. 

"I think we'll walk," said For- 
ester. "It's such a nice night, 
moon out bright, and it's good to 
think about a thing and antici- 
pate a long time before. Don't 
you agree?" 

"Yes, sir," said the men. 

They began to walk. 

"Hellman," said Forester. 

"What, sir?" 

" I was just thinking about 
Hellman," said the Captain. 
"Back on Earth now, Hellman 
the cynic." 

A year from now, he could see 
Hellman standing in his pent- 
house apartment, drinking a quiet 
drink, laughing to his friends. 



"Do you see this planet labeled 
Planet 4 in Star System 70?" 
Click. "I turn it off like a light. 
Do you see this rocket, this tiny 
model no bigger than a seed, 
numbered A-1000? See, I toss it 
into the waste-basket." A wave 
of the hand. The tinkle of the 
tiny rocket in the trash-bin. 
"What did I tell you, friends? 
They'll never come back. They're 
dead. It's a horrid planet. They're 
tortured and broken and dead. 
Oh, 1 warned them. Space travel! 
We'll never see them again, poor 
idiots!" 

Forester increased his stride. 
Among his men, he found his 
place. They walked down away 
from the green forest, talking 
quietly, with the silvery rocket 
glowing in the moonlight behind 
them, and all of the fresh planet 
around them, a wine creek flow- 
ing for them, baked fish lolling in 
the hot-water springs, fruit ripen- 
ing in the night trees, and distant 
forests and lakes waiting for them 
to happen by. They walked off 
across the endless green lawns, 
beyond the forest, near the six 
white stones, to the edge of the 
river. 



the first record of a meteorite display was made by Andrew Ellicott on 
November 12, 1799. He wrote in his journal : "The whole heaven appeared 
as if illuminated with sky rockets, flying in an infinity of directions, and I 
was in constant expectation of some of them falling on the vessel. They 
continued until put out by the light of the sun after day break."

The Last Day 



By RICHARD MATHESON 

This, we wight as well warn you, is what Hollywood calls a downbeat 
story. Not that we're especially fond of them ourselves; but every 
so often stick a yam will point out a truth too often overlooked. 

Also, they are tricky to write. Too much accent on pure despair 
and the reader walks out long before the end. There must be in the 
people of such a story an undistorted reflection of us all: a common 
denominator anyone can recognize within himself. 

Waxing philosophical is like waxing a floor; it is powerful easy 
to fall on your face while trying it. But we have an abiding faith 
in Alan's ability to rise to greatness in the shadow of destruction. 
Evidently Dick Matheson feels much the same way, for his handling 
of character in The Last Day is masterful in its sy?npathetic por- 
trayal of the best and the'worst in all of us. 




e woke up and the first thing he thought was: 
. the last night is gone. 



He had slept through half of it. 

He lay there on the floor and looked up at the ceiling. 
The walls still glowed reddish from the outside light. 
There was no sound in the living room but that of 
snoring. 

He looked around. There were bodies sprawled all 
over the room. On the couch, slumped on chairs, curled 
up on the floor. 

He raised up on one elbow and winced at the shoot- 
ing pains in his head. He closed his eyes and held them 



93 



tightly shut for a moment. Then 
he opened them again. He ran his 
tongue over the inside of his dry 
mouth. There was stilt a stale 
taste of liquor and food in his 
mouth. 

He rested on his elbow as he 
looked around the room again , 
his mind slowly registering the 
scene. 

Nancy and Bill lying in each 
other's arms, both naked. Nor- 
man curled up in an arm chair, his 
thin face taut as he slept. Mort 
and Mel lying on the floor, cov- 
ered with dirty throw rugs. Both 
snoring. Others on the floor. 

Outside the red glow. 

He looked at the window and 
his throat moved. He blinked. He 
looked down over his long body. 
He swallowed again. 

I'm alive, he thought, and it's 
all true. 

He rubbed his eyes. He took a 
deep breath of the dead air in the 
apartment. 

He knocked over a glass as he 
struggled to his feet. The liquor 
and soda sloshed over the rug and 
soaked into the dark blue weave. 

He looked around at the other 
glasses, broken, kicked over, 
hurled against the wall. He looked 
at the bottles all over, all empty. 

He stood staring around the 
room. He looked at the record 
player overturned, the albums all 
strewn around, jagged pieces of 
records in crazy patterns on the 
rug. 



He remembered. 

It was Mort who had started 
it the night before. Mort who had 
suddenly rushed to the playing 
record machine and shouted 
drunkenly, "What the hell is 
music any more! Just a lot of 
noise! " 

And he had driven the point of 
his shoe against the front of the 
record player and knocked it 
against the wall. He had lurched 
over and down on his knees. He 
had struggled up with the player 
in his beefy arms and heaved the 
entire thing over on its back and 
kicked it again. 

"The hell with music!" Mort 
had yelled. ' ' I hate the crap 
anyway! " 

Then he'd started to drag rec- 
ords out of their albums and their 
envelopes and snap them over his 
kneecap. 

"Come on!" he'd yelled to 
everybody. "Come on!" 

And it had caught on. The way 
all crazy ideas had caught on in 
those last few days. 

Mel had jumped up from mak- 
ing love to a girl. He had flung 
records out the windows, scaling 
them far across the street. And 
Charlie had put aside his gun for 
a moment to stand at the windows 
too and try to hit people in the 
street with the records. 

Richard had watched the dark 
saucers bounce and shatter on the 
sidewalks below. He'd even thrown 
one himself. Then he'd just turned 



94 



 



away and let the others rage. He'd 
taken Mel's girl into the bedroom 
and for a few moments they forgot 
what was happening to their 
world. 

He thought about that as he 
stood waveringly in the reddish 
light of the room 

He closed his eyes a moment. 

Then he looked at Nancy and 
remembered taking her too some- 
time in the jumble of wild hours 
that had been yesterday and last 
night. 

She looked vile now, he thought. 
She'd always been an animal. Be- 
fore, though, she'd had to veil it. 
Now, in the final twilight of 
everything, she could revei in the 
only thing she'd ever really cared 
about. 

He wondered if there were any 
people left in the world with real 
dignity. The kind that was still 
there when it no longer was 
necessary to impress people with it. 

He stepped over the body of a 
sleeping girl. She had on only a 
si ip. He looked down at her 
tangled hair, at her smeared red 
lips, at the tight, unhappy frown 
printed on her face. 

He glanced into the bedroom as 
he passed it. There were three 
girls and two men in the bed. 

He found the body in the bath- 
room. 

It was thrown carelessly in the 
tub and the shower curtain torn 
down to cover it. Only the legs 



showed, dangling ridiculously over 
the front rim of the tub. 

He drew back the curtain and 
looked at the blood-soaked shirt, 
at the white, still face. 

Charlie. 

He shook his head, then turned 
away and washed his face and 
hands at the sink. It didn't mat- 
ter. Nothing mattered. As a mat- 
ter of fact, Charlie was one of the 
lucky ones now. A member of the 
legion who had put their heads 
into ovens, or cut their wrists or 
taken pills or done away with 
themselves in the accepted fash- 
ions of suicide. 

As he looked at his tired face in 
the mirror he thought of cutting 
his wrists. But he knew he 
couldn't. Because it took more 
than just despair to incite self- 
destruction. 

He took a drink of water. 
Lucky, he thought, there's still 
water running. He didn't suppose 
there was a sou! left to run the 
water system. Or the electric sys- 
tem or the gas system or the tele- 
phone system or any system for 
that matter. 

What fool would work on the 
last day of the world? 

Spencer was in the kitchen 
when Richard went in. 

He was sitting in his shorts at 
the table looking at his hands. On 
the stove some eggs were frying. 
The gas must still be working 
then too, Richard thought. 



THE LAST DAY 



95 



"Hello," he said to Spencer. 

Spencer grunted without look- 
ing up. He stared at his hands. 
Richard let it go. He turned the 
gas down a little. He took bread 
out of the cupboard and put it 
in the electric toaster. But the 
toaster didn't work. He shrugged 
and forgot about it. 

"What time is it?" Spencer was 
looking at him with the question. 
- Richard looked at his watch. 
"It stopped," he said. 

They looked at each other. 

"Oh," Spencer said. Then he 
asked, "What day is it?" 

Richard thought. "Sunday, I 
think," he said. 

" I wonder if people are at 
church," Spencer said. 

"Who cares?" 

Richard opened the refriger- 
ator. 

"There aren't any more eggs," 
Spencer said. 

Richard shut the door. "No 
more eggs," he said dully, "No 
more chickens. No more any- 
thing." 

He leaned against the wall with 
a shuddering breath and looked 
out the window at the red sky. 
. Mary, he thought. Mary, who 
I should have married. Who I let 
go. He wondered where she was. 
He wondered if she were thinking 
about him at all. 

Norman came trudging in, 
groggy with sleep and hangover. 
His mouth hung open. He looked 
dazed. 



"Morning," he slurred. 

"Good morning, merry 'Sun- 
shine,' ' Richard said , wi thou t 
mirth. 

Norman looked at him blankly. 
Then he went over to the sink and 
washed out his mouth. He spit the 
water down the drain. 

"Charlie's dead," he said. 

"I know," Richard said. 

"Oh. When did it happen?" 

"Last night," Richard told him. 
"You were unconscious. You re- 
member how he kept saying he 
was going to shoot us all? Put us 
out of our misery?" 

"Yeah," Norman said. " He put 
the muzzle against my head. He 
said feel how cool it is." 

"Well, he got in a fight with 
Mort," Richard said. "The gun 
went off." He shrugged. "That 
was it." 

They looked at each other with- 
out expression. 

Then Norman turned his head 
and looked out the window. "It's 
still up there," he muttered. 

They looked up at the great 
flaming ball in the sky that crowded 
out the sun, the moon, the stars. 

Norman turned away, his throat 
moving. His lips trembled and he 
clamped them together. "Jesus," 
he said. "It's today." 

He looked up at the sky again. 
"Today," he repeated. "Every- 
/Atwg." 

"Everything," said Richard. 
Spencer got up and turned off 
the gas. He looked down at the 



96 



AMAZING STOKIES 



eggs for a moment. Then he said, 
"What the hell did I fry these 
for?" 

He dumped them into the sink 
and they slid greasily over the 
white surface. The yolks burst and 
spurted smoking, yellow fluid over 
the enamel. 

Spencer bit his lips. His face 
grew hard. "I'm taking her again," 
he said suddenly. 

He pushed past Richard and 
dropped his shorts off as he turned 
the corner into the hallway. 

"There goes Spencer," Richard 
said. 

Norman sat down at the table. 
Richard stayed at the wall. 

In the living room they heard 
Nancy suddenly call out at the 
top of her strident voice: "Hey, 
wake up, everybody! Watch me 
do it! Watch me, everybody, 
watch mel ' ' 

Norman looked at the kitchen 
doorway for a moment/ Then 
something gave inside of him and 
he slumped his head forward on 
his arms on the table. His thin 
shoulders shook. 

"I did it too," he said brokenly. 
"I did it too. Oh God, what did 
I come here for?" 

"Sex," Richard said. "Like all 
the rest of us. You thought you 
could end your life in carnal, 
drunken bliss." 

Norman's voice was muffled. 
" I can't die like that," he sobbed. 
"I can't." 



"A couple of billion people are 
doing it," Richard said. "When 
the sun hits us, they'll still be at 
it. What a sight." 

The thought of a world's people 
indulging themselves in one last 
orgy of animalism made him shud- 
der. He closed his eyes and pressed 
his forehead against the wall and 
tried to forget. 

But the wall was warm. 

Norman looked up from the 
table. "Let's go home," he said. 

Richard looked at him. 
"Home?" he said. 

"To our parents. My mother 
and father. Your mother." 

Richard shook his head. ' ' I 
don't want to," he said. 

" But I can't go alone." 

"Why?" 

"Because ... I can't. You 
know how the streets arc full of 
guys just killing everybody they 
meet." 

Richard shrugged. 

"Why won't you? " Norman 
asked. 

" I don't want to see her." 
"Your mother?" 
"Yes." 

"You're crazy," Norman said. 
"Who else is there to . . ." 
"No." 

He thought of his mother at 
home waiting for him. Waiting for 
him on the last day. And it made 
him ill to think of delaying, of 
maybe never seeing her again. 

But he kept thinking: how can 
1 go home and have her try to 



THE LAST DAY 



97 



make me pray? Try to make me 
read from the Bible, spend these 
last hours in a muddle of religious 
absorption ? 

He said it again for himself. 
"No." 

Norman looked lost. His chest 
shook with a swallowed sob. "I 
want to see my mother," he said. 

"Go ahead," Richard said 
casually. 

But his insidcs were twisting 
themselves into knots. To never 
see her again. Or his sister and her 
husband and her daughter. 

Never to see any of them again. 

He sighed. It was no use fight- 
ing it. In spite of everything, 
Norman was right. Who else was 
there in the world to turn to? In 
a wide world about to be burned, 
was there any other person who 
loved him above all others? 

"Oh ... all right," he said. 
"Come on. Anything to get out 
of this place." 

The apartment house hall 
smelted of vomit. They found the 
janitor dead drunk on the stairs. 
They found a dog in the foyer 
with its head kicked in. 
- They stopped as they came out 
the entrance of the building. 

Instinctively, they looked up. 

At the red sky, like molten slag. 
At the fiery wisps that fell like 
hot rain drops through the atmos- 
phere. At the gigantic ball of flame 
that kept coming closer and closer, 
that blotted out the universe. 



They lowered their watering 
eyes. It hurt to look. They started 
walking along the street. It was 
very warm, 

"December," Richard said. 
"It's like the tropics." 

As they walked along in silence 
he thought of the tropics, of the 
poles, of all the world's countries 
he would never see. Of all the 
things he would never do. 

Like hold Mary in his arms and 
tell her, as the world was ending, 
that he loved her very much and 
was not afraid. 

"Never" he said, feeling himself 
go rigid with frustration. 

"What?" Norman said. 

"Nothing. Nothing." 

As they walked Richard felt 
something heavy in his jacket 
pocket. It bumped against his side. 
He reached in and drew out the 
object. 

"What's that?" Norman asked. 

"Charlie's gun," Richard said. 
" I took it last night so nobody else 
would get hurt." 

His laughter was harsh. "So 
nobody else would get hurt," he 
said bitterly. "Jesus, I ought to 
be on the stage." 

He was about to throw it away 
when he changed bis mind. He 
slid it back into his pocket. 

" I may need it," he said. 

Norman wasn't listening. 
"Thank God nobody stole my 
car. Oh—!" 

Somebody had thrown a rock 
through the windshield. 



98 



 



"What's the difference?" Rich- 
ard said. 

"I . . . none, I suppose." 

They got into the front seat 
and brushed the glass off the 
cushion. It was stuffy in the car. 
Richard pulled off his jacket and 
threw it out. He put the gun in 
his side pants pocket. 

As Norman drove downtown 
they passed people in the street. 

Some were running around 
wildly, as if they were searching 
for something. Others were fight- 
ing. Strewn all over the sidewalks 
were bodies of people who had 
leaped from windows and been 
struck down by speeding cars. 
Buildings were on fire, windows 
shattered from the explosions of 
unlit gas jets. 

There were people looting stores. 

" What's the matter with them? " 
Norman asked miserably. " Is that 
how they want to spend rheir last 
day?" 

"Maybe that's how they spent 
their whole life, ' ' R ichard an- 
swered. 

He leaned against the door and 
gazed at the people they passed. 
Some of them waved at him. Some 
cursed and spat. A few threw 
things at the speeding car. 

" People die the way they lived," 
he said. "Some good, some bad." 

"Look out!" Norman cried out 
as a car came careening down the 
street on the wrong side. Men and 
women hung out of the window 



shouting and singing and waving 
bottles. 

Norman twisted the wheel vio- 
lently and they missed the car by 
inches. 

"Are they crazy?" he said. 

Richard looked out through the 
back window. He saw the car skid, 
saw it get out of control and go 
crashing into a store front and 
turn over on its side, the wheels 
spinning crazily. 

He turned back without speak- 
ing. Norman kept looking ahead 
grimly, his hands on the wheel, 
white and tense. 

Another intersection. 

A car came speeding across their 
path. Norman jammed on the 
brakes with a gasp. They crashed 
against the dashboard, getting 
their breath knocked out. 

Then, before Norman could get 
the car started again, a gang of 
teen-age boys with knives and 
clubs came dashing into the inter- 
section. They'd been chasing the 
other car. Now they changed 
direction and flung themselves at 
the car that held Norman and 
Richard. 

Norman threw the car into first 
and gunned across the street. 

A boy jumped on the back of 
the car. Another tried for the 
running board, missed and went 
spinning over the street. Another 
jumped on the running board and 
grabbed the door handle. He 
slashed at Richard with a knife. 



THE LAST DAY 



99 



"Gonna kill ya bastids!" yelled 
the boy. " Sonsabitches ! " 

He slashed again and tore open 
the back of the seat as Richard 
jerked his shoulder to the side. 

"Get out of here!" Norman 
screamed, trying to watch the boy 
and the street ahead at the same 
time. 

The boy tried to open the door 
as the car wove wildly down 
Broadway. He slashed again but 
the car's motion made him miss. 

"I'll get ya!" he screamed in a 
fury of brainless hate. 

Richard tried to open the door 
and knock the boy off, but he 
couldn't. The boy's twisted white 
face thrust in through the window. 
He raised his knife. 

Richard had the gun now. He 
shot the boy in the face. 

The boy flung back from the car 
with a dying howl and landed like 
a sack of rocks. He bounced once, 
his left leg kicked and then he lay 
still. 

Richard twisted around. 

The boy on the back was still 
hanging on, his crazed face pressed 
against the back window. Richard 
saw his mouth moving as the boy 
cursed. 

"Shake him off!" he said. 

Norman headed for the side- 
walk, then suddenly veered back 
into the street. The boy hung on. 
Norman did it again. The boy still 
clung to the back. 

Then on the third time he lost 
his grip and went off. He tried to 



run along the street but his mo- 
mentum was too great and he 
went leaping over the curb and 
crashing into a plate glass win- 
dow, arms stuck up in front of 
him to ward off the blow. 

They sat in the car, breathing 
heavily. They didn't talk for a 
long while. Richard flung the gun 
out the window and watched it 
clatter on the concrete and bounce 
off a hydrant. Norman started to 
say something about it, then 
stopped. 

The car turned into Fifth Ave- 
nue and started downtown at 
sixty miles an hour. There weren't 
many cars. 

They passed churches. People 
were packed inside them. They 
overflowed out onto the steps. 

"Poor fools," Richard nuit- 
tered, his hands still shaking. 

Norman took a deep breath. 
"I wish I was a poor fool," he 
said. "A poor fool who could be- 
lieve in something." 

"Maybe," Richard said. Then 
he added, "I'd rather spend the 
last day believing what I think is 
true." 

"The last day," Norman said. 
"I . . ." He shook his head. "I 
can't believe it," he said. "I read 
the papers. I see that . . . that 
thing up there. I know it's going 
to happen. But God! The end?" 

He looked at Richard for a split 
second. "Nothing afterward?" 

Richard said, "I don't know." 

At 14th Street Norman drove 



100 



 



to the East side, then sped across 
the Manhattan Bridge. He didn't 
stop for anything, driving around 
bodies and wrecked cars. Once he 
drove over a body and Richard 
saw his face twitch as the wheel 
rolled over the dead man's leg. 

"They're all lucky," Richard 
said. "Luckier than we are." 

They stopped in front of Nor- 
man's house in Brooklyn. Some 
kids were playing ball in the street. 
They didn't seem to realize what 
was happening. Their shouts 
sounded very loud in the silent 
street. Richard wondered if their 
parents knew where the children 
were. Or cared. 

Norman was looking at him. 
"Well . . .?" he started to say. 

Richard felt his stomach mus- 
cles tightening. He couldn't an- 
swer. 

"Would you . . . like to come 
in. for a minute?" Norman asked. 

Richard shook his head. "No," 
he said- " I better get home. I'. . . 
should see her. My mother, I 
mean." 

"Oh." Norman nodded. Then 
he straightened up. He forced a 
momentary calm over himself. 
"For what it's worth, Dick," he 
said, " I consider you my best 
friend and . . ." 

He faltered. He reached out and 
gripped Richard's hand. Then he 
pushed out of the car, leaving the 
keys in the ignition. 

"So long," he said hurriedly. 

Richard watched his friend run 



around the car and move for the 
apartment house. When he had 
almost reached the door, Richard 
called out: "Norm!" 

Norman stopped and turned. 
The two of them looked at each 
other. All the years they had 
known each other seemed to 
flicker between them. 

Then Richard managed to smile. 
He touched his forehead in a last 
salute. 

"So long, Norm," he said. 

Norman didn't smile. He pushed 
through the door and was gone. 

Richard looked at the door for 
a long time. He started the motor. 
Then he turned it off again think- 
ing that Norman's parents might 
not be home. 

After a while he started it again 
and began the trip home. 

As he drove he kept thinking. 

The closer he got to the end, the 
less he wanted to face it. He 
wanted to end it now. Before the 
hysterics started. 

Sleeping pills, he decided. It was 
the best way. He had some at 
home. He hoped there were enough 
left. There might not be any left 
in the corner drug store. There'd 
been a rush for sleeping pills 
during those last few days. Entire 
families took them together. 

He reached the house without 
event. Overhead the sky was an 
incandescent crimson. He felt the 
heat on his face like waves from a 
distant oven. He breathed in the 



THE LAST DAY 



101 



heated air, his lungs cringing. 

He unlocked the front door and 
walked in slowly. 

I'll probably find her in the 
front room, he thought. Sur- 
rounded by her books, praying, 
exhorting invisible powers to suc- 
cor her as the world prepared to 
fry itself. 

She wasn*t in the front room. 

He searched the house. And, as 
he did, his heart began to beat 
quickly, and when he knew she 
really wasn't there he felt a great 
hollow feeling in his stomach. He 
knew that his talk about not 
wanting to see her had been just 
talk. He loved her. And she was 
the only one left now. 

He searched for a note in her 
room, in his, in the living room. 

** Mom," he said. " Mom, where 
are you? " 

He found the note in the 
kitchen. He picked it up from the 
table: 

Richard darling, 
I'm at your sister's 
house. Please come there. 
Don't make me spend 
the last day without you. 
Don't make me leave this 
world without seeing your 
dear face again. Please. 
The last day. 

There it was in black and white. 
And, of all people, it had been his 
mother to write down the words. 
She who had always been so 
skeptical of his taste for material 
science. Now admitting the reali- 



ty of science's last prediction. 

Because she couldn't doubt any 
more. Because the sky was filled 
with flaming evidence and no one 
could doubt any more. 

The whole world going. The 
staggering detail of evolutions and 
revolutions, of strifes and clashes, 
of endless continuities of centuries 
streaming back into the clouded 
past, of rocks and trees and ani- 
mals and men. All to pass. In a 
flash, in a moment. The pride, the 
vanity of man's world incinerated 
by a freak of astronomical dis- 
order. 

What point was there to all of 
it, then? None, none at all. Be- 
cause it was all ending. 

He got sleeping pills from the 
medicine cabinet and left. He 
drove to his sister's house thinking 
about his mother as he passed 
through the streets littered with 
everything from empty bottles to 
dead people. 

If only he didn't dread the 
thought of arguing with his 
mother on this last day. Of disput- 
ing with her about her God and 
her conviction. 

He made up his mind not to 
argue. He'd force himself to make 
their last day a peaceful one. He 
would accept her simple devotion 
and not hack at her faith any 
more. 

The front door was locked at 
Grace's house. He rang the bell 
and, after a moment, heard hur- 
ried steps inside. 



102 



 



He heard Ray shout inside, 
"Don't open it, Mom! It may be 
that gang again ! " 

"It's Richard, I know it is!" 
his mother called back. 

Then the door was open and she 
was embracing him and crying 
happily. 

He didn't speak at first. Finally 
he said softly, "Hello, Mom." 

His niece Doris played all after- 
noon in the front room while 
Grace and Ray sat motionless in 
the living room looking at her. 

If I were with Mary, Richard 
kept thinking. If only we were 
together today. Then he thought 
that they might have had chil- 
dren. And he would have had to 
sit like Grace and know that the 
few years his child had lived 
would be its only years. 

The sky grew brighter as eve- 
ning approached. It flowed with 
violent crimson currents. Doris 
stood quietly at the window 'and 
looked at it. She hadn't laughed 
all day or cried. And Richard 
thought to himself, she knows. 

And thought too that at any 
moment his mother would ask 
them all to pray together. To sit 
and read the Bible and hope for 
divine charity. 

But she didn't say anything. 
She smiled. She made supper. 
Richard stood with her in the 
kitchen as she made supper. 

"I may not wait," he told her. 
"I . . . may take sleeping pills." 



"Are you afraid, son? " she 
asked. 

"Everybody is afraid," he said. 

She shook her head. " Not 
everybody," she said. 

Now, he thought, it's coming. 
That smug look, the opening line. 

She gave him a dish with the 
vegetable and they all sat down 
to eat. 

During supper none of them 
spoke except to ask for food. 
Doris never spoke once. Richard 
sat looking at her from across the 
table. 

lie thought about the night 
before. The crazy drinking, the 
fighting, the carnal abuses. He 
thought of Charlie dead in the 
bathtub. Of the apartment in 
Manhattan. Of Spencer driving 
himself into a frenzy of lust as the 
climax to his life. Of the boy lying 
dead in the New York gutter with 
a bullet in his brain. 

They all seemed very far away. 
He could almost believe it had all 
never happened. Could almost 
believe that this was just another 
evening meal with his family. 

Except for the cherry glow that 
filled the sky and flooded in 
through the windows like an aura 
from some fantastic fireplace. 

Near the end of the meal Grace 
went and got a box. She sat down 
at the table with it and opened it. 
She took out white pills. Doris 
looked at her, her large eyes 
searching. 



THE LAST DAY 



103 



"This is dessert," Grace told 
her. "We're all going to have 
white candy for dessert." 

" Is it peppermint?" Doris asked 
quietly. 

"Yes," Grace said. "It's pep- 
permint." 

Richard felt his scalp crawling 
as Grace put pills in front of 
Doris. In front of Ray. 

"We haven't enough for all of 
us," she said to Richard. 

"1 have my own," he said. 

"Have you enough for Mom?" 
she asked. 

" I won't need any," her mother 
said. 

In his tenseness Richard almost 
shouted at her. Shouted stop being 
so damned noble! But he held 
himself. He stared in fascinated 
horror at Doris holding the pills in 
her small hand. 

" This isn't peppermint," she 
said. "Momma, this isn't — " 

" Yes it is." Grace took a deep 
breath. "Hat it, darling." 

Doris put one in her mouth. 
She made a face. Then she spit it 
into her palm. "It isn't pepper- 
mint," she said, upset. 

Grace threw up her hand and 
dug her teet h in the white knuckles. 
Her eyes moved frantically to 
Ray. 

" Eat it, Doris," Ray said. "Eat 
it, it's good." 

Doris started to cry. "No, 1 
don't like it." 

"Eat it!" 

Ray turned away suddenly, his 



body shaking. Richard tried to 
think of some way to make her 
eat the pills, but he couldn't. 

Then his mother spoke. "We'll 
play a game, Doris," she said. 
"We'll see if you can swallow all 
the candy before I count ten. If 
you do, I'll give you a dollar." 

Doris sniffed. "A dollar?" she 
said. 

Richard's mother nodded. 
"One," she said. 

Doris didn't move. 

"Two," said Richard's mother. 
"A dollar . . ." 

Doris brushed aside a tear. 
"A . . . whole dollar? " 

"Yes, darling. Three, four, 
hurry up." 

Doris reached for the pills. 

"Five . . . six . . . seven . . ." 

Grace had her eyes shut tightly. 
Her cheek's were white. 

"Nine . . . ten ..." 

Richard's mother smiled, but 
her lips trembled and there was a 
glistening in her eyes. "There," 
she said cheerfully. "You've won 
the game." 

Grace suddenly put pills into 
her mouth and swallowed them 
in fast succession. She looked at 
Ray. He reached out one trem- 
bling hand and swallowed his pills. 
Richard put his hand in his pocket 
for his pills but took it out again. 
He didn't want his mother to 
watch him take them. 

Doris got sleepy almost imme- 
diately. She yawned and couldn't 



104 



keep her eyes open. Ray picked 
her up and she rested against 
his shoulder, her small arms around 
his neck. Grace got up and the 
three of them went back into the 
bedroom. 

Richard sat there while his 
mother went back and said good- 
bye to them. He sat staring at the 
white tablecloth, at the remains of 
food. 

When his mother came back she 
smiled at him. "Help me with the 
dishes," she said. 

"The . . .?" he started. Then 



he stopped. What difference did it 
make what they did? 

He stood with her in the red-lit 
kitchen feeling a sense of sharp 
unreality as he dried the dishes 
they would never use again and 
put them in the closet that would 
be no more in a matter of hours. 

He kept thinking about Ray 
£fhd Grace in the bedroom. Finally 
he left the kitchen without a word 
and went back. He opened the 
door and looked in. He looked at 
the three of them for a long time. 
Then he shut the door again and 




walked slowly back to the kitchen. 
He stared at his mother. 

"They're . . ." 

"All right," his mother said. 

"Why didn't you say anything 
to them?" he asked her. "How 
come you let them do it without 
Baying anything?" 

" Richard," she said, "everyone 
has to make his own way on this 
day. No one can tell others what 
to do. Doris was their child." 

"And I'm yours. . . ." 

"You're not a child any longer," 
she said. 

He finished up the dishes, his 
fingers numb and shaking, " Mom, 
about last night . . ."he started. 

"I don't care about it." 

"But . . ." 

"It doesn't matter," she said. 
"This part is ending." 

Now, he thought, almost with 
pain. This part. Now she would 
talk about afterlife and heaven 
and reward for the just and 
eternal penitence for the sinning. 

She said, "Let's go out and sit 
on the porch." 

He didn't understand. He 
walked through the quiet house 
with her. He sat next to her on 
the porch steps and thought: I'll 
riever see Grace again. Or Doris. 
Or Norman or Spencer or Mary. 

He couldn't take it all in. It 
was too much. All he could do was 
sit there woodenly and look at the 
red sky and the huge sun about to 
swallow them. He couldn't even 
feel nervous any more. Fears were 



blunted by endless repetition. 

"Mom," he said after a while, 
"why . . . why haven't you spo- 
ken about religion to me? I know 
you must want to." 

She looked at him and her face 
was very gentle in the red glow. 
"I don't have to, darling," she 
said . " I know we'll be together 
when this is over. You don't have 
to believe it. I'll believe for both 
of us." 

And that was all. He looked at 
her, wordless before her confidence. 

"If you want to take those pills 
now," she said, " it's all right. 
You can go to sleep in my lap." 

He felt himself tremble. "You 
wouldn't mind?" 

" I want you to do what you 
think is best." 

I le didn't know what to do until 
he thought of her sitting there 
alone when the world ended. 

"I'll stay with you," he said. 

She smiled. " If you change your 
mind," she said, "you can tell 
me." 

They were quiet for a while. 
Then she said, "It is pretty." 

"Pretty?" he asked. 

"Yes," she said. "God closes 
a bright curtain on our play." 

He didn't know. But he put his 
arm around her shoulders and 
she leaned against him. And he 
did know one thing. 

They sat there in the evening 
of the last day. And, though there 
was no actual point to it, they 
loved each other.

TH 



E INVADERS 



By MURRAY LEINSTER 

started in Greece on the day after tomorrow. Before 
the last act raced to a close, Coburn was buried to his 
ears in assorted adventures, including a revolution and 
an invasion from outer space! 

We're not given to throwing around, the word " epic" 
lightly, but here is one! Swashbuckling action, a great 
many vivid characters, and a weird mystery — all spun 
for you by one of the master story-tellers of our time. 



ON a certain day — it may be in 
the history books eventually 
— Coburn was in the village of 
Ardea, north of Salonika in the 
most rugged part of Greece. He 
was making a survey for purposes 
which later on turned out not to 



matter much. The village of Ardea 
was small, it was very early in the 
morning, and he was trying to get 
his car started when he heard the 
yell. 

It was a shrill yell, and it trav- 
eled fast. Coburn jerked his head 



THE INVADERS 



107 



Upright from the hood of the car. 
A whiskered villager with flapping 
trousers came pounding up the 
single street. His eyes were panic- 
stricken and his mouth was wide. 
He emitted the yell in a long, sus- 
tained note. Other villagers 
popped into view like ants from a 
disturbed ant-hilL Some instantly 
ran back into their houses. Others 
began to run toward the outskirts 
of the village, toward the south. 

Coburn, watching blankly, 
found himself astonished at the 
number of people the village con- 
tained. He hadn't dreamed it was 
so populous. All were in instant 
frenzied flight toward the moun- 
tains. An old woman he'd seen 
barely hobbling, now ran like a 
deer. Children toddled desper- 
ately. Adults snatched them up 
and ran. Larger children fled on 
twinkling legs. The inhabitants of 
Ardea vanished toward the hills in 
a straggling, racing, panting 
stream. They disappeared around 
an outcrop of stone which was 
merely the nearest place that 
would hide them. Then there was 
silence. 

Coburn turned his head blankly 
in the direction from which they 
had run. He saw the mountains — 
incredibly stony and barren. That 
was all. No, not quite — there 
was something far away which 
was subtly different in color from 
the hillsides. It moved. It flowed 
over a hill crest, coming plainly 
from somewhere beyond the moun- 



tains. It was vague in shape. Co- 
burn felt a momentary stirring of 
superstition. There simply couldn't 
be anything so huge. . . . 

But there could. There was. It 
was a column of soldiers in uni- 
forms that looked dark-gray at 
this distance. It flowed slowly out 
of the mountains like a colossal 
snake — some Midgard monster 
or river of destruction. It moved 
with an awful, deliberate steadi- 
ness toward the village of Ardca. 

Coburn caught his breath. Then 
he was running too. He was out of 
the village almost before he real- 
ized it. He did not try to follow 
the villagers. He might lead pur- 
suers after them. There was a 
narrow defile nearby. Tanks could 
hardly follow it, and it did not 
lead where they would be going. 
He plunged into it and was in- 
stantly hidden. He pelted on. It 
was a trail from somewhere, be- 
cause he saw ancient donkey- 
droppings on the stones, but he 
did not know where it led. He 
simply ran to get away from the 
village and the soldiers who were 
coming toward it. 

This was Greece. They were 
Bulgarian soldiers. This was not 
war or even invasion. This was 
worse — a cold-war raid. He kept 
running and presently rocky clifts 
overhung him on one side, a vast 
expanse of sky loomed to his left. 
He found himself panting. He 
began to hope that he was actu- 
ally safe. 



108 



 



Then he heard a voice. It 
sounded vexed. Quite incredibly, 
it was talking English. "But my 
dear young lady ! " it said severely. 
"You simply mustn't go on! 
There's the very devil of a mess 
turning up, and you mustn't run 
into it!" 

A girl's voice answered, also in 
English. "I'm sure — I don't 
know what you're talking about! " 

"I'm afraid I can't explain. 
But, truly, you mustn't go on to 
the village!" 

Coburn pushed ahead. He came 
upon the people who had spoken. 
There was a girl riding on a don- 
key. She was American. Trim. 
Neat. Uneasy, but reasonably 
self-confident. And there was a 
man standing by the trail, with a 
slide of earth behind him and mud 
on his boots as if he'd slid down 
somewhere very fast to intercept 
l his girl. He wore the distinctive 
costume a Brilish correspondent 
is apt to affect in the wilds. 

They turned as Coburn came 
into view. The girl goggled at 
him. He was not exactly the sort 
of third person one expected to 
find on a very lonely, ill-defined 
rocky trail many miles north of 
Salonika. 

When they turned to him, Co- 
burn recognized the man. He'd 
met Dillon once or twice in Salon- 
ika. He panted: "Dillon! There's 
a column of soldiers headed across 
the border! Bulgarians!" 

"How close? " asked Dillon. 



"They're coming," said Co- 
burn, with some difficulty due to 
lack of breath. " I saw them across 
the valley. Everybody's run away 
from the village. I was the last 
one out." 

Dillon nodded composedly. He 
looked intently at Coburn. "You 
know me," he said reservedly. 
"Should I remember you?" 

"I've met you once or twice," 
Coburn told htm. "In Salonika." 

"Oh," said Dillon. "Oh, yes. 
Sorry. I've got some cameras up 
yonder. I want a picture or two of 
those Bulgarians. See if you can 
persuade this young lady not to 
go on. I fancy it's safe enough 
here. Not a normal raid route 
through this pass." 

Coburn nodded. Dillon expected 
the raid, evidently. This sort of 
thing had happened in Turkey. 
Now it would start up here, in 
Greece. The soldiers would strike 
fast and far, at first. They 
wouldn't stop to hunt down the 
local inhabitants. Not yet. 

1 ' We'll wai t , ' ' said Coburn. 
" You'll be back? " 

"Oh, surely!" said Dillon. "Five 
minutes or less." 

He started up the precipitous 
wall, at whose bottom he had slid 
down. He climbed remarkably 
well. He went up hand-over-hand 
despite the steepness of the stone. 
It looked almost impossible, but 
Dillon apparently found hand- 
grips by instinct, as a good 
climber does. In a matter of min- 



TIIE INVADEKS 



109 



utes he vanished, some fifty feet 
up, behind a bulging mass of 
stone. He did not reappear. 

Coburn began to get his breath 
back. The girl looked at him, her 
forehead creased. 

"Just to make sure," said Co- 
burn, "I'll see if I can get a view 
back down the trail." 

Where the vastness of the sky 
showed, he might be able to look 
down. He scrambled up a barrier 
two man-heights high. There was 
a screen of straggly brush, with 
emptiness beyond. He peered. 

He could see a long way down 
and behind, and actually the vil- 
lage was clearly in sight from here. 



There were rumbling, caterpillar- 
tread tanks in the act of entering 
it. There were anachronistic 
mounted men with them. Cavalry 
is outdated, nowadays, but in 
rocky mountain country they can 
have uses where tanks can't go. 
But here tanks and cavalry looked 
grim. Coburn squirmed back and 
beckoned to the girl. She joined 
him. They peered through the 
brushwood together. 

The light tanks were scurrying 
along the single village street. 
Horsemen raced here and there. A 
pig squealed. There was a shot. 
The tanks emerged from the other 
side. They went crawling swiftly 
toward the south. But they did 



110 



 



not turn aside where the villagers 
had. They headed along the way 
Coburn had driven to Ardea. 

Infantrymen appeared, march- 
ing into the village. An advance 
party, rifles ready. This was strict 
discipline and standard military 
practise. Horsemen rode to tell 
them that all was quiet. They 
turned and spurred away after 
the tanks. 

The girl said in a strained voice. 
"This is war starting! Invasion!" 

Coburn said coldly, "No. No 
planes. This isn't war. It's a train- 
ing exercise, Iron-Curtain style. 
This outfit will strike twenty — 
maybe thirty miles south. There's 
a town there — Kilkis. They'll 



take it and loot it. By the time 
Athens finds out what's happened, 
they'll be ready to fall back. 
They'll do a little fighting. They'll 
carry off the people. And they'll 
deny everything. The West doesn't 
want war. Greece couldn't fight 
by herself. And America wouldn't 
believe that such things could 
happen. But they do. It's what's 
called cold war. Ever hear of 
that?" 

The main column of soldiers far 
below poured up to the village 
and went down the straggly street 
in a tide of dark figures. The vil- 
lage was very small. The soldiers 
came out of the other end of the 
village. They poured on after the 



THE INVADERS 



111 



tanks, rippling over irregularities 
in the way. They seemed innumer- 
able. 

"Three or four thousand men," 
said Coburn coldly. "This is a big 
raid. But it's not war. Not yet." 

It was not the time for full-scale 
war. Bulgaria and the other coun- 
tries in its satellite status were 
under orders to put a strain upon 
the outside world. They were 
building up border incidents and 
turmoil for the benefit of their 
masters. Turkey was on a war 
footing, after a number of inci- 
dents like this. Indo-China was at 
war. Korea was an old story. Now 
Greece. It always takes more men 
to guard against criminal actions 
than to commit them. When this 
raid was over Greece would have 
to maintain a full-size army in its 
northern mountains to guard 
against its repetition. Which would 
be a strain on its treasury and 
might help toward bankruptcy. 
This was cold war. 

The infantry ended. Horse- 
drawn vehicles appeared in a 
seemingly endless line. Motorized 
transport would be better, but 
the Bulgarians were short of it. 
Shaggy, stubby animals plodded 
in the wake of the tanks and the 
infantry. There were two-wheeled 
carts in single file all across the 
valley. They went through the 
village and filed after the soldiers. 

"I think," said Coburn in bit- 
ing anger, "this will be all there 
is to see. They'll go in until they're 



stopped. They'll kidnap Greek 
civilians and later work them to 
death in labor camps. They'll 
carry off some children to raise as 
spies. But their purpose is prob- 
ably only to make such a threat 
that the Greeks will go broke 
guarding against them. They 
know the Greeks don't want war." 

He began to wriggle back from 
the brushwood screen . He was 
filled with the sort of sick rage 
that comes when you can't ac- 
tively resent insolence and arro- 
gance. He hated the people who 
wanted the world to collapse, and 
this was part of their effort to 
bring it about. 

He helped the girl down. "Dil- 
lon said to wait," he said. He 
found himself shaking with anger 
at the men who had ordered the 
troops to march. "He said he was 
taking pictures. He must have had 
an advance tip of some sort. If 
so, he'll have a line of retreat." 

Then Coburn frowned. Not 
quite plausible, come to think of 
it. But Dillon had certainly known 
about the raid. He was set to take 
pictures, and he hadn't been sur- 
prised. One would have expected 
Greek Army photographers on 
hand to take pictures of a raid of 
which they had warning. Probably 
United Nations observers on the 
scene, too. Yes. There should be 
Army men and probably a United 
Nations team up where Dillon 
was. 

Coburn explained to the girl.

AMAZING stories 



"That'll be it. And they'll have a 
radio, too. Probably helicopters 
taking them out also. I'll go up 
and tell them to be sure and have 
room for you." 

He started for the cliff he'd 
seen Dillon cli mb. He paused : 
"I'd better have your name for 
them to report to Athens." 

"I'm Janice Ames," she told 
him. "The Breen Foundation has 
me going around arranging for 
lessons for the people up here. 
Sanitation and nutrition and mid- 
wifery, and so on. The Founda- 
tion office is in Salonika, though." 

He nodded and attacked the 
cliff, 

It hadn't been a difficult climb 
for Dillon. It wasn't even a long 
one for Coburn, but it was much 
worse than he'd thought. The 
crevices for handholds were rare, 
and footholds were almost non- 
existent. There were times when 
he felt he was holding on by his 
fingernails. Dillon seemed to 
have made it with perfect ease, 
but Coburn found it exhausting. 

Fifty feet up he came to the 
place where Dillon had vanished. 
But it was a preposterously diffi- 
cult task to get across an undercut 
to where he could grasp a stunted 
tree. It was a strain to scramble 
up past it. Then he found himself 
on the narrowest of possible ledges, 
with a sickening drop off to one 
side. But Dillon had made it, so 
he followed. 



He went a hundred yards, and 
then the ledge came to an end. He 
saw where Dillon must have 
climbed. It was possible, but Co- 
burn violently did not want to try. 
Still ... He started. 

Then something clicked in his 
throat. There was a rather deep 
ledge for a space of four or five 
feet. And there was Dillon. No, 
not Dillon. Just Dillon's clothes. 
They lay flat and deflated, but 
laid out in one assembly beside a 
starveling twisted bush. It would 
have been possible for a man to 
stand there to take off his clothes, 
if he wanted to. But a man who 
takes off his clothes — and why 
should Dillon do that? — takes 
them off one by one. These gar- 
ments were fitted together. The 
coat was over the shirt, and the 
trousers fitted to the bottom of 
the shirt over the coat, and the 
boots were at the ends of the 
trouser legs. 

Then Coburn saw something he 
did not believe. It palpably was 
not true. He saw a hand sticking 
out of the end of the sleeve. But 
it was not a hand, because it had 
collapsed. It was rather like an 
unusually thick glove, flesh color. 

Then he saw what should have 
been Dillon's head. And it was in 
place, too. But it was not Dillon's 
head. It was not a head at all. It 
was something quite different. 
There were no eyes. Merely holes. 
Openings. Like a mask. 

Coburn felt a sort of roaring in 



THE INVADERS 



113 



his ears, and he could not think 
clearly for a moment because of 
the shrieking impossibility of 
what he was looking at. Dillon's 
necktie had been very neatly un- 
tied, and left in place in his collar. 
His shirt had been precisely un- 
buttoned. He had plainly done it 
himself. And then — the unbut- 
toned shirt made it clear — he 
had come out of his body. Physi- 
cally, he had emerged and gone 
on. The thing lying flat that had 
lapsed at Cobum's feet was Dil- 
lon's outside. His outside only. 
The inside had come out and gone 
away. It had climbed the cliff 
over Coburn's head. 

The outside of Dillon looked 
remarkably like something made 
out of foam-rubber. Cob urn 
touched it, insanely. 

He heard his own voice saying 
flatly: "It's a sort of suit. A suit 
that looks like Dillon. He was in 
it. Something was! Something is 
playing the part of Dillon. Maybe 
it always was. Maybe there isn't 
any Dillon." 

He felt a sort of hysterical com- 
posure. He opened the chest. It 
was patently artificial. There were 
such details on the inside as would 
be imagined in a container needed 
to fit something snugly. At the 
edges of the opening there were 
fastenings like the teeth of a zip- 
per, but somehow different. Co- 
burn knew that when this was 
fastened there would be no visi- 
ble seam. 



Whatever wore this suit-that- 
looked-like-Dillon could feel per- 
fectly confident of passing for Dil- 
lon, clothed or otherwise. It could 
pass without any question for — 

Coburn gagged. 

// could pass without question for 
a human being. 

Obviously, whatever was wear- 
ing this foam-rubber replica of 
Dillon was not human! 

Coburn went back to where he 
had to climb down the cliffside 
again. He moved like a sleep- 
walker. He descended the fifty- 
foot cliff by the crevices and the 
single protruding rock-point that 
had helped him get up. It was 
much easier going down. In his 
slate of mind it was also more 
dangerous. He moved in a sort of 
robot-like composure. 

He moved toward the girl, 
trying to make words come out 
of his throat, when a small rock 
came clattering down the cliff. 
He looked up. Dillon was in the 
act of swinging to the first part of 
the descent. He came down, very 
confident and assured. He had 
two camera-cases slung from his 
shoulders. Coburn stared at him, 
utterly unable to believe what 
he'd seen ten minutes before. 

Dillon reached solid ground and 
turned. He smiled wryly. His 
shirt was buttoned. His tie was 
tied. 

"I hoped," he said ruefully to 
Janice Ames, "that the Bulgars 
would toddle off. But they left a 



114 



 



guard in the village. We can't 
hope to take an easier trail. We'll 
have to go back the way you 
came. We'll get you safe to Sa- 
lonika, though." 

The girl smiled, uneasily but 
gratefully. 

' 1 And," added Dillon , 1 ' we'd 
better get started." 

He gallantly helped the girl 
remount her donkey. At the sight, 
Coburn was shaken out of his 
numbness. He moved fiercely to 
intervene. But Janice settled her- 
self in the saddle and Dillon con- 
fidently led the way. Coburn 
grimly walked beside her as she 
rode. He was convinced that he 
wouldn't leave her side while Dil- 
lon was around. But even as he 
knew that desperate certitude, he 
was filled with confusion and a 
panicky uncertainty. 

When they'd traveled about 
half a mile, another frightening 
thought occurred to Coburn. Per- 
haps Dillon — passing for human 
— wasn't alone. Perhaps there 
were thousands like him. 

Invaders! Usurpers, pretending 
to be men. Invaders, obviously, 
from space! 

II 

They made eight miles. At least 
one mile of that, added together, 
was climbing straight up. Another 
mile was straight down. The rest 
was boulder-strewn, twisting, don- 
key-wide, slanting, slippery stone. 



But there was no sign of anyone 
but themselves. The sky remained 
undisturbed. No planes. They saw 
no sign of the raiding force from 
across the border, and they heard 
no gunfire. 

Coburn struggled against the 
stark impossibility of what he had 
seen. The most horrifying concept 
regarding invasion from space is 
that of creatures who are able to 
destroy or subjugate humanity. 
A part of that concept was in Co- 
burn's mind now. Dillon marched 
on ahead, in every way convinc- 
ingly human. But he wasn't. 
And to Coburn, his presence as a 
non-human invader of Earth 
made the border-crossing by the 
Bulgarians seem almost benevo- 
lent. 

They went on. The next hill was 
long and steep. Then they were at 
the hill crest. They looked down 
into a village called Naousa. It 
was larger than Ardea, but not 
much larger. One of the houses 
burned un tended. Figures moved 
about. There were tanks in sight, 
and many soldiers in the uniform 
that looked dark-gray at a dis- 
tance. The route by which Dillon 
had traveled had plainly curved 
into the line-of-march of the Bul- 
garian raiding force. 

But the moving figures were not 
soldiers. The soldiers were still. 
They lay down on the grass in 
irregular, sprawling windrows. 
The tanks were not in motion. 
There were two-wheeled carts in 



THE INVADERS 



115 



sight — reaching back along the 
invasion-route — and they were 
just as stationary as the men and 
the tanks. The horses had toppled 
in their shafts. They were mo- 
tionless. 

The movement was of civilians 
— men and women alike. They 
were Greek villagers, and they 
moved freely among the unmili- 
tarily recumbent troops, and even 
from this distance their occupa- 
tion was clear. They were happily 
picking the soldiers' pockets. But 
there was one figure which moved 
from one prone figure to another 
much too quickly to be looting. 
Coburn saw sunlight glitter on 
something in his hand. 

Dillon noticed the same thing 
Coburn did at the same instant. 
He bounded forward. He ran to- 
ward the village and its tumbled 
soldiers in great, impossible leaps. 
No man could make such leaps or 
travel so fast. He seemed almost 
to soar toward the village, shout- 
ing. Coburn and Janice saw him 
reach the village. They saw him 
rush toward the one man who had 
been going swiftly from one prone 
soldier to another. It was too far 
to see Dillon's action, but the sun- 
light glittered again on something 
bright, which this time flew 
through the air and dropped to 
the ground. 

The villagers grouped about 
Dillon. There was no sign of a 
struggle. 



"What's happened?" demanded 
Janice uneasily. "Those are sol- 
diers on the ground." 

Coburn's fright prevented his 
caution. He shouted furiously. 
"He's not a man! You saw it! 
No man can run so fast! You saw 
those jumps! He's not human! 
He's — something else!" 

Janice jerked her eyes to Co- 
burn in panic. "What did you 
say?" 

Coburn panted: "Dillon's no 
man ! He's a monster from some- 
where in space! And he and his 
kind have killed those soldiers! 
Murdered them! And the soldiers 
are men! You stay here. I'll go 
down there and — " 

"No!" said Janice, "I'm com- 
ing too." 

He took the donkey's halter 
and led the animal down to the 
village, with Janice trembling a 
little in the saddle. He talked in a 
tight, taut, hysterical tone. He 
told what he'd found up on the 
cliffside. He described in detail 
the similitude of a man's body 
he'd found deflated beside a 
stunted bush. 

He did not look at Janice as he 
talked. He moved doggedly to- 
ward the village, dragging at the 
donkey's head. They neared the 
houses very slowly, and Coburn 
considered that he walked into the 
probability of a group of other 
creatures from unthinkable other 
star systems, disguised as men. 
It did not occur to him that his 



116 



 



sudden outburst about Dillon 
sounded desperately insane to 
Janice. 

They reached, the first of the 
fallen soldiers. Janice looked, 
shuddering. Then she said thinly: 
"He's breathing!" 

He was. He was merely a boy. 
Twenty or thereabouts. He lay 
on his back, his eyes closed. His 
face was upturned like a dead 
man's. But his breast rose and fell 
rhythmically. He slept as if he 
were drugged. 

But that was more incredible 
than if he'd been dead. Regiments 
of men fallen simultaneously 
asleep. . . . 

Coburn 's flow of raging speech 
stopped short. He stared. He saw 
other fallen soldiers. Dozens of 
them, fn coma-like slumber, the 
soldiers who had come to loot and 
murder lay like straws upon the 
ground, if they had been dead it 
would have been more believable. 
At least there are ways to kill 
men. But this . , . 

Dillon parted the group of vil- 
lagers about him and came to- 
ward Cob urn and Janice. He was 
frowning in a remarkably human 
fashion. 

"Here's a mess!" he said irri- 
tably. "Those Bulgars came 
marching down out of the pass. 
The cavalry galloped on ahead 
and cut the villagers off so they 
couldn't run away. They started 
to loot the village. They weren't 



pleasant. Women began to scream, 
and there were shootings — all in 
a matter of minutes. And then the 
looters began to act strangely. 
They staggered around and sat 
down and went to sleep!" 

He waved his hands in a help- 
less gesture, but Coburn was not 
deceived. 

"The tanks arrived. And they 
stopped — and their crews went 
to sleep! Then the infantry ap- 
peared, staggering as it marched. 
The officers halted to see what 
was happening ahead, and the 
entire infantry dropped off to 
sleep right where it stood! 

" It's bad! If it bad happened a 
mile or so back . . . The Greeks 
must have played a trick on 
them, but those cavalrymen raised 
the devil in the few minutes they 
were out of hand ! They killed 
some villagers and then keeled 
over. And now the villagers aren't 
pleased. There was one man 
whose son was murdered, and he's 
been slitting the Bulgars' throats!" 

He looked at Coburn, and Co- 
burn said in a grating voice: "I 
see." 

Dillon said distressedly : "One 
can't let them slit the throats of 
sleeping men! I'll have to stay 
here to keep them from going at 
it again. I say, Coburn, will you 
take one of their staff cars and run 
on down somewhere and tell the 
Greek government what's hap- 
pened here? Something should be 
done about it ! Soldiers should

come to keep order and take 
charge of these chaps." 

"Yes," said Coburn. "I'll do it. 
I'll take Janice along, too." 

"Splendid!" Dillon nodded as 
if in relief. "She'd better get out 
of the mess entirely. I fancy 
there' d have been a full-scale 
massacre if we hadn't come along. 
The Greeks have no reason to 
love these chaps, and their inten- 
tions were hardly amiable. But 
one can't let them be murdered!" 

Coburn had his hand on his re- 
volver in his pocket. His finger 
was on the trigger. But if Dillon 
needed him to rim an errand, then 
there obviously were no others of 
his own kind about. 

Dillon turned his back. He gave 
orders in the barbarous dialect of 
the mountains. His voice was 
authoritative. Men obeyed him 
and dragged uniformed figures out 
of a light half-track that was 
plainly a staff car. Dillon beck- 
oned, and Coburn moved toward 
him. The important thing as far 
as Coburn was concerned was to 
get Janice to safety. Then to re- 
port the full event. 

"I ... I'm not sure . . ."be- 
gan Janice, her voice shaking. 

"I'll prove what I said," raged 
Coburn in a low tone. "I'm not 
crazy, though I feel like it!" 

Dillon beckoned again. Janice 
slipped off the donkey's back. 
She looked pitifully frightened 
and irresolute. 



"I've located the chap who's 
the mayor of this village, or some- 
thing like that. Take htm along. 
They might not believe you, but 
they'll have to investigate when 
he turns up." 

A white-bearded villager re- 
luctantly climbed into the back 
of the car. Dillon pleasantly of- 
fered to assist Janice into the 
front seat. She climbed in, deathly 
white, frightened of Coburn and 
almost ashamed to admit that his 
vehement outburst had made her 
afraid of Dillon, too. 

Dillon came around to Coburn's 
side of the vehicle. " Privately," 
he said with a confidential air, 
"I'd advise you to dump this may- 
or person where lie can reach au- 
thority, and then go away quietly 
and say nothing of what hap- 
pened up here. If the Greeks are 
using some contrivance that han- 
dles an affair like this, it will be 
top secret. They won't like civil- 
ians knowing about it." 

Coburn's grip on his revolver 
was savage. It seemed likely, 
now, that Dillon was the only 
one of his extraordinary kind 
about. 

"I think I know why you say 
that," he said harshly. 

Dillon smiled. "Oh, come now!" 
he protested. "I'm quite unoffi- 
cial! " 

He was incredibly convincing 
at that moment. There was a 
wry half-smile on his face. He 
looked absolutely human; abso- 



118 



 



lutely like the British correspond- 
ent Coburn had met in Salonika. 
He was too convincing. Coburn 
knew he would suspect his own 
sanity unless he made sure. 

"You're not only unofficial," 
said Coburn grimly. His hand 
came up over the edge of the 
staff-car door. It had his revolver 
in it. It bore inexorably upon the 
very middle of Dillon's body. 
"You're not human, either! 
You're not a man! Your name 
isn't Dillon! You're — something 
I haven't a word for! But if you 
try anything fancy I'll see if a 
bullet through your middle will 
stop you !" 

Dillon did not move. He said 
easily: "You're being absurd, my 
dear fellow. Put away that pistol." 

"You slipped!" said Coburn 
thickly. "You said the Greeks 
played a trick on this raiding 
party. But you played it. At 
Ardea, when you climbed that 
cliff — no man could climb so 
fast. No man could run as you ran 
down Into this village. And I saw 
that body you're wearing when 
you weren't in it! I followed you 
up the cliff when — " Coburn's 
voice was ragingly sarcastic — 
"when you were taking pictures!" 

Dillon's face went impassive. 
Then he said: "Well?" 

"Will you let me scratch your 
finger?" demanded Coburn al- 
most hysterically. "If it bleeds, 
I'll apologize and freely admit 



I'm crazy ! But if it doesn't . . ." 

The .thing-that-was-not-Dillon 
raised its eyebrows. "It wouldn't," 
it said coolly. "You do know. 
What follows?" 

"You're something from space," 
accused Coburn, "sneaking around 
Earth trying to find out how to 
conquer us! You're an Invader! 
You're trying out weapons. And 
you want me to keep my mouth 
shut so we Earth people won't 
patch up our own quarrels and 
join forces to hunt you down! 
But we'll do it! We'll do it!" 

The thing-that-was-not-Dillon 
said gently: "No. My dear chap, 
no one will believe you." 

" We'll see about that ! " snapped 
Coburn. "Put those cameras in 
the car!" 

The figure that looked so hu- 
man hesitated a long instant, 
then obeyed. It lowered the two 
seeming cameras into the back 
part of the staff car. 

Janice started to say, "I . . . 
I . . ." 

The pseudo-Dillon smiled at 
her. "You think he's insane, and 
naturally you're scared," it said 
reassuringly. " But he's sane. He's 
quite right. I am from outer space. 
And I'm not humoring him either. 
Look!" 

He took a knife from his pocket 
and snapped it open. He deliber- 
ately ran the point down the side 
of one of his fingers. 

The skin parted. Something 
that looked exactly like foam- 



THE INVADERS 



119 



rubber was revealed. There were 
even bubbles in it. 

The pseudo-Dillon said, "You 
see, you don't have to be afraid 
of him. He's sane, and quite hu- 
man. You'll feel much better trav- 
eling with him." Then the figure 
turned to Coburn. "You won't 
believe it, but I really like you, 
Coburn. I like the way you've 
reacted. It's very . . . human." 

Coburn said to him: "It'll be 
human, too, when we start to 
hunt you down!" He let the staff 
car in gear. Dillon smiled at him. 
He let in the clutch, and the car 
leaped ahead. 

In the two camera-cases Coburn 
was sure that he had the cryptic 
device that was responsible for the 
failure of a cold-war raid. He 
wouldn't have dared drive away 
from Dillon leaving these devices 
behind. If they were what he 
thought, they'd be absolute proof 
of the truth of his Story, and they 
should furnish clues to the sort of 
science the Invaders possessed. 
Show the world that Invaders 
were upon it, and all the world 
would combine to defend Earth. 
The cold war would end. 

But a bitter doubt came to him. 
Would they? Or would they offer 
zestfully to be viceroys and over- 
seers for the Invaders, betraying 
the rest of mankind for the privi- 
lege of ruling them even under 
unhuman masters? 

Janice swayed against his shoul- 



der. He cast a swift glance at her. 
Her face was like marble. 

"What's the matter?" 

She shook her head. " I'm trying 
not to faint," she said unsteadily. 
"When you told me be was from 
another world 1 . . . thought you 
were crazy. But when he admitted 
it . . . when he proved it . . ." 

Coburn growled. The trail 
twisted and dived down a steep 
slope. It twisted again and ran 
across a rushing, frothing stream. 
Coburn drove into the rivulet. 
Water reared up in wing-like 
sheets on either side. The staff 
car climbed out, rocking, on the 
farther side. Coburn put it to the 
ascent beyond. The trail turned 
and climbed and descended as the 
stony masses of the hills required. 

" He's — from another world ! " 
repeated Janice. Her teeth chat- 
tered. "What do they want — 
creatures like him? How ■— how 
many of them are there? Anybody 
could be one of them! What do 
they want?" 

"This is a pretty good world," 
said Coburn fiercely. "And his 
kind will want it. We're merely 
the natives, the aborigines, to 
them, Maybe they plan to wipe 
us out, or enslave us. But they 
won't! We can spot them now! 
They don't bleed. Scratch one and 
you find — foam-rubber. X-rays 
will spot them. We'll learn to pick 
them out — and when some spe- 
cialists look over those things that 
look like cameras we'll know more 



120 



 



slill! Enough to do something!" 

"Then you think it's an inva- 
sion from space?" 

"What else?" snapped Coburn. 

II is stomach was a tight 
cramped knot now. He drove the 
car hard! 

In air miles the distance to be 
covered was relatively short. In 
road miles it seemed interminable. 
The road was bad and curving be- 
yond belief. It went many miles 
east and many miles west for 
every mile of southward gain. The 
hour grew late. Coburn had lied 
Ardea at sunrise, but they'd 
reached Naousa after midday and 
he drove frantically over incredi- 
ble mountain roads until dusk. 
Despite sheer recklessness, how- 
ever, he could not average thirty 
miles an hour. There were times 
when even the half-track had to 
crawl or it would overturn. The 
sun set, and he went on up steep 
grades and down steeper ones in 
the twilight. Night fell and the 
headlights glared ahead, and the 
staff-car clanked and clanked and 
grumbled and roared on through 
the darkness. 

They probably passed through 
villages — the headlights showed 
stone hovels once or twice — but 
no lights appeared. It was mid- 
night before they saw a moving 
yellow spot of brightness with a 
glare as of fire upon steam above 
it. There were other small lights 
in a row behind it, and they 



saw that all the tights moved. 

"A ra ilroad ! " said Coburn. 
"We're getting somewhere!" 

It was a railroad train on the 
other side of a valley, but they did 
not reach the track. The highway 
curved away from it. 

At two o'clock in the morning 
they saw electric lights. The high- 
way became suddenly passable. 
Presently they ran into the still, 
silent streets of a slumbering 
town — Serrai — an administra- 
tive center for this part of Greece. 
They threaded its ways while 
Coburn watched for a proper 
place to stop. Once a curiously- 
hatted policeman stared blankly 
at them under an arc lamp as the 
staff car clanked and rumbled past 
him. They saw a great pile of stone 
which was a church. They saw a 
railroad station. 

Not far away there was a build- 
ing in which there were lights. A 
man in uniform came out of its 
door. 

Coburn stopped a block away. 
There were uneasy stirrings, and 
the white-bearded passenger from 
the village said incomprehensible 
things in a feeble voice. Coburn 
got Janice out of the car first. She 
was stiff and dizzy when she tried 
to walk. The Greek was in worse 
condition still. He clung to the 
side of the staff car. 

"We tell the truth," said Co- 
burn curtly, "when we talk to the 
police. We tell the whole truth — 
except about Dillon. That sounds 



THK INVADERS 



121 



too crazy. We tell it to top-level 
officials only, after they realize 
that something they don't know 
anything about has really taken 
place. Talk of Invaders from space 
would either get us locked up as 
lunatics or would create a panic. 
This man will tell what happened 
up there, and they'll investigate. 
But we take these so-called cam- 
eras to Salonika, and get to an 
American battleship." 

He lifted Dillon's two cameras 
by the carrying-straps. And the 
straps pulled free. They'd held the 
cases safely enough during a long 
journey on foot across the moun- 
tains. But they pulled clear now. 

Coburn had a bitter thought. 
He struck a match. He saw the 
leather cases on the floor of the 
staff car. He picked up one of 
them. He took it to the light of 
the headlights, standing there in 
the resonant darkness of a street 
in a city of stone houses. 

The leather was brittle. It was 
friable, as if it had been in a fire. 
Coburn plucked it open, and it 
came apart in his hands. Inside 
there was the smell of scorched 
things. There was a gritty metallic 
powder. Nothing else. The other 
carrying-case was in exactly the 
same condition. 

Coburn muttered bitterly: 
"They were set to destroy them- 
selves if they got into other hands 
than Dillon's. We haven't a bit of 
proof that he wasn't a human 



being. Not a shred of proof!" 

He suddenly felt a sick rage, as 
if he had been played with and 
mocked. The raid from Bulgaria 
was serious enough, of course. It 
would have killed hundreds of 
people and possibly hundreds of 
others would have been enslaved. 
But even that was secondary in 
Coburn's mind. The important 
thing was that there were Invad- 
ers upon Earth. Non-human mon- 
sters, who passed for humans 
through disguise. They had been 
able to travel through space to 
land secretly upon Earth. They 
moved unknown among men, 
learning the secrets of mankind, 
preparing for — what? 

Ill 

They got into Salonika early 
afternoon of the next day, after 
many hours upon an antique rail- 
road train that puffed and grunted 
and groaned among interminable 
mountains. Coburn got a taxi to 
take Janice to the office of the 
Breen Foundation which had sent 
her up to the north of Greece to 
establish its philanthropic in- 
struction courses. He hadn't much 
to say to Janice as they rode. He 
was too disheartened. 

In the cab, though, he saw great 
placards on which newspaper 
headlines appeared in Greek. He 
could make out the gist of them. 
Essentially, they shrieked that 
Bulgarians had invaded Greece 



122 



 



and had been wiped out. He made 
out the phrase for valiant Greek 
army. And the Greek army was 
valiant enough, but it hadn't had 
anything to do with this. 

From the police station in 
Serrai — he had been interviewed 
there until dawn — he knew what 
action had been taken. Army 
planes had Mown northward in 
the darkness, moved by the May- 
or's, and Coburn 's, and Janice's 
tale of Bulgarian soldiers on 
Greek soil, sleeping soundly. They 
had released parachute flares and 
located the village of Naousa. 
Parachutists with field radios had 
jumped, while other flares burned 
to light them to the ground. That 
was that. Judging by the placards, 
their reports had borne out the 
story Coburn had brought down. 
There would be a motorized Greek 
division on the way to take charge 
of the four-thousand-odd uncon- 
scious raiders. There was probably 
an advance guard there now. 

But there was no official news. 
Even the Greek newspapers called 
it rumors. Actually, it was leaked 
information. It would be reason- 
able for the Greek government to 
let it leak, look smug, and blandly 
say "No comment" to all in- 
quiries, including those from Bul- 
garia. 

But behind that appearance of 
complacency, the Greek govern- 
ment would be going quietly mad 
trying to understand what so for- 
tunately had happened. And Co- 



burn could tell them. But he knew 
better than to try without some 
sort of proof. Yet, he had to tell. 
The facts were more important 
than what people thought of him. 

The cab stopped before his own 
office. He paid the driver. The 
driver beamed and said happily: 
" Tys nikisame, e?" 

Coburn said, " Poly kala. Orea." 

His office was empty. It was 
dustier than usual. His secretary 
was probably taking a holiday 
since he was supposed to be out of 
town. He grunted and sat down at 
the telephone. He called a man he 
knew. Hallen — another Ameri- 
can — was attached to a non- 
profit corporation which was at- 
tached to an agency which was 
supposed to cooperate with a 
committee which had something 
to do with NATO. Hallen an- 
swered the phone in person. 

Coburn identified himself. 
' ' Have you heard any ru mors 
about a Bulgarian raid up-coun- 
try? " he asked. 

"I haven't heard anything else 
since I got up," Hallen told him. 

"I was there," said Coburn. "I 
brought the news down. Can you 
come over?" 

"I'm halfway there now!" said 
Hallen as he slammed down the 
phone. 

Coburn paced up and down his 
office. It was very dusty. Even 
the seat of the chair at his secre- 
tary's desk was dusty. The odds 



THE INVADERS 



123 



were that she was coming in only 
to sort the mail, and not even sit- 
ting down for that. He shrugged. 

He heard footsteps. The door 
opened. H is secretary, Helena, 
came in. She looked surprised. 

"I was at lunch," she explained. 
She had a very slight accent. She 
hung up her coat. "I am sorry. I 
stopped at a store." 

He had paused in his pacing to 
nod at her. Now he stared, but 
her back was turned toward him. 
He blinked. She had just told a 
very transparent lie. And Helena 
was normally very truthful. 

"You had a good trip?" she 
asked politely. 

"Fair," said Coburn. "Any 
phone calls this morning ? " he 
asked. 

"Not this morning," she said 
politely. 

She reached in a desk drawer. 
She brought out paper. She put 
it in the typewriter and began to 
type. 

Coburn felt very queer. Then he 
saw something else. There was a 
fly in the office - — a large, green- 
bodied fly of metallic lustre. The 
inhabitants of Salonika said with 
morbid pride that it was a spe- 
cialty of the town, with the most 
painful of all known fly stings. 
And Helena abhorred flies. 

It landed on the bare skin of her 
neck. She did not notice. It stayed 
there. Ordinarily she would have 
jumped up, exclaiming angrily in 
Greek, and then she would have 



pursued the fly vengefully witli a 
folded newspaper until she killed 
it. But now she ignored it. 

Hallen came in, stamping. Co- 
burn closed the door behind him. 
He felt queer at the pit of his 
stomach. For Helena to let a fly 
stay on her neck suggested that 
her skin was . . . somehow not 
like its usual self. 

"What happened to those Bul- 
garians?" demanded Hallen. 

Coburn told him precisely what 
he'd seen when he arrived in 
Naousa after an eight-mile hike 
through mountains. Then he went 
back and told Hallen precisely 
what he'd seen up on the cliff side. 

"His cameras were some sort of 
weapon. He played it on the 
marching column, it took effect 
and they went to sleep," he fin- 
ished. "I took them away from 
him and brought them down, 
but — " 

He told about the contents of 
the camera cases being turned to 
a gritty, sooty powder. Then he 
added: "Dillon set them to de- 
stroy themselves. You under- 
stand. He's not a man. He's a 
creature from some planet other 
than Earth, passing for a human 
being. He's an Invader from 
space." 

Hallen 's expression was uneasy 
and compassionate but utterly 
unbelieving. Helena shivered and 
turned away her face. Coburn's 
lips went taut. He reached down 
to his desk. He made a sudden, 



124 



AMAZIXG STORIES 



abrupt gesture. Hallen caught his 
breath and started up. 

Coburn said curtly: "Another 
one of them. Helena, is that 
foam-suit comfortable?" 

The girl jerked her face around. 
She looked frightened. 

' ' Helena , " said Cobu rn , " the 
real Helena, that is, would not 
sit down on a dusty chair. No 
woman would. But you did. She is 
a very truthful girl. You lied to 
me. And I just stuck pins in your 
shoulder and you didn't notice. 
They're sticking in your foam suit 
now. You and the creature that 
passed for Dillon up-country are 
bot h aliens. I nvaders. Do you 
want to try to convince me other- 
wise?" 

The girl said evenly: "Mr. Co- 
burn, I do not think you are 
well — " 

Then Coburn said thickly: " I'm 
crazy enough to put a bullet 
through you if your gang of devils 
has harmed the real Helena. 
What's happened to her?" 

Hallen moved irresolutely to 
interfere. But the girl's expression 
(hanged. She smiled. "The real 
Helena, Mr. Coburn," said an 
entirely new voice, "has gone to 
the suburbs to visit her fiancee's 
family. She is quite safe." 

There was dead silence. The 
figure — it even moved like Hel- 
ena — got composedly to its feet. 
It got its coat. It put the coat on. 
Hallen stared with his mouth 



open. The pins hadn't convinced 
him, but the utterly different 
voice coming from this girl's 
mouth had. Yet, waves of con- 
flicting disbelief and conviction, 
horror and a racking doubt, 
chased themselves over his fea- 
tures. 

"She admits she's not Helena!" 
said Coburn with loathing. "It's 
not human! Should I shoot it?" 

The girl smiled at him again. 
Her eyes were very bright. "You 
will not, Mr. Coburn. And you 
will not even try to keep me 
prisoner to prove your story. If I 
screamed that you attack me — " 
the smile widened — " Helena's 
good Greek friends would come to 
my assistance." 

She walked confidently to the 
door and opened it. Then she said 
warmly: "You are very intelli- 
gent, Mr. Coburn. We approve of 
you very much. But nobody will 
believe you." 

The office door closed. 

Coburn turned stiffly to the 
man he'd called to hear him. 
"Should I have shot her, Hal- 
len?" 

Hallen sat down as if his knees 
had given way beneath him. 
After a long time he got out a 
handkerchief and painfully mopped 
his face. At the same time he shiv- 
ered. 

"N-no. . . ." Then he swal- 
lowed. "My God, Coburn! It's 
true!" 

"Yes," said Coburn bitterly, 



THE INVADKKS 



125 



"or you're as crazy as I am." 

Hallen's eyes looked haunted. 
**I — I . . ." He swallowed 
again. "There's no question about 
the Bulgarian business. That did 
happen ! And you were there. And 
— there've been other things. 
. . . Rumors. . . . Reports that 
nobody believed. ... I might 
be able to get somebody to listen. 
. . ." He shivered again. "If it's 
true, it's the most terrible thing 
that ever happened. Invaders 
from space. . . . Where do you 
think they came from, Coburn?" 

"The creature that looked like 
Dillon could climb incredibly fast. 
I saw it run and leap. Nothing on 
Earth could run or leap like that." 
Coburn shrugged. " Maybe a planet 
of another sun, with a monstrous 
gravity." 

"Try to get somebody to be- 
lieve that, eh?" Hallen got pain- 
fully to his feet. "I'll see what I 
can do. I . . . don't know that I 
can do anything but get myself 
locked up for observation. But I'll 
call you in an hour." 

He went unsteadily out of the 
door. Coburn instantly called the 
Breen Foundation on the tele- 
phone. He'd left Janice there less 
than an hour before. She came to 
the phone and gasped when she 
heard his voice. Raging, he told 
her of Helena, then cautioned her 
to be especially careful — to be 
suspicious of everybody. 

"Don't take anybody's word!" 
snapped Coburn. "Doubt every- 



body! Doubt me! Unl il you're ab- 
solutely certain. Those creatures 
are everywhere. . . . They may 
pre Lend lo be anybody!" 

After Coburn hung up on 
Janice, he sat back and tried to 
think logically. There had to be 
some way by which an extra- 
terrestrial Invader could be told 
instantly from a human being. 
Unmask and prove even one such 
creature, and the whole story 
would be proved. But how detect 
them? Their skin was perfectly 
deceptive. Scratched, of course, 
they could be caught. But one 
couldn't go around scratching 
people. There was nothing of the 
alien creature's own actual form 
that showed. 

Then Coburn remembered the 
Dillon foam suit. The head had 
been hollow. Flaccid. Holes in- 
stead of eyes. The creature's own 
eyes showed through. 

But he'd have to make certain. 
He'd have to look at a foam-suited 
creature. He could have examined 
Helena's eyes, but she was gone 
now. However, there was an al- 
ternative. There was a Dillon in 
Salonika, as there was a Helena. 
If the Dillon in Salonika was the 
real Dillon — if there were a real 
Dillon — he could look at his 
eyes. He could tell if he were the 
false Dillon or the real one. 

At this hour of the afternoon a 
Britisher would consider tea a 
necessity. There was only one 



1 26 



 



place in Salonika where they 
served tea that an Englishman- 
would consider drinkable. Coburn 
got into a cab and gave the driver 
the address, and made sure of the 
revolver in his pocket. He was 
frightened. He was either going to 
meet with a monster from outer 
space, or be on the way to making 
so colossal a fool of himself that a 
mental asylum would yawn for 
him. 

He went into the one coffee- 
shop in Salonika which served 
drinkable tea. It was dark and 
dingy inside, though the table- 
clothes were spotless. He went in, 
and there was Dillon. 

Coburn's flesh crawled. If the 
figure sitting there with the Lon- 
don Times and a cup of tea before 
him were actually a monster from 
another planet . . . 

But Dillon read comfortably, 
and sipped his tea. Coburn ap- 
proached, and the Englishman 
looked up inquiringly. 

"I was ... up in the moun- 
tains," said Coburn feverishly, 
"when those Bulgarians came 
over. I can give you the story." 

Dillon said frostily: "I'm not 
interested. The government's of- 
ficially denied that any such inci- 
dent took place. It's merely a 
silly rumor." 

It was reasonable that it should 
be denied. But it had happened, 
nonetheless. Coburn stared, de- 
spite a consciousness that he was 
not conspicuously rational in the 



way his eyes searched Dillon's 
face hungrily. The eyes were dif- 
ferent! The eyes of the Dillon up 
in the mountains had been larger, 
and the brown part — But he had 
to be sure. 

Suddenly, Coburn found him- 
self grinning. There was a simple, 
a perfect, an absolute test for 
humanity! 

Dillon said suspiciously: "What 
the devil are you staring at me 
for?" 

Coburn continued to grin un- 
controllably, even as he said in a 
tone of apology: " I hate to do this, 
but I have to be sure. . . ." 

He swung. He connected with 
Dillon's nose. Blood started. 

Coburn zestfully let himself 
be thrown out, while Dillon 
roared and tried to get at him 
through the flying wedge of wait- 
ers. He felt an enormous relaxa- 
tion on the way back to his office 
in another cab. He was a trifle 
battered, but it was worth it. 

Back in the office he called 
Hallen again. And again Hallen 
answered. He sounded guilty and 
worried. 

" I don't know whether I'm 
crazy or not," he said bitterly. 
"But I was in your office. I saw 
your secretary there — and she 
didn't feel pins stuck in her. And 
something did happen to those 
Bulgarians that the Greeks don't 
know anything about, or the 
Americans either. So you're to tell 



THE INVADKKS 



127 



your story to the high brass down 
in Athens. I think you'll be locked 
up afterward as a lunatic — and 
me with you for believing my own 
eyes. But a plane's being readied." 

"Where do I meet you?" asked 
Coburn. 

Hallen told him. A certain room 
out at the airport. Coburn hung 
up. The telephone rang instantly. 
He was on the way out, but he 
turned back and answered it, 
Janice's voice — amazingly con- 
vincing — came from the instru- 
ment. And at the first words his 
throat went d ry. Because it 
couldn't be Janice. 

"I've been trying to get you. 
Have you tried to reach me?" 

"Why, no. Why?" 

Janice's voice said : " I've some- 
thing interesting to tell you. I 
left the office an hour ago. I'm at 
the place where I live when I'm in 
Salonika. Write down the address. 
Can you come here? I've found out 
something astonishing!" 

He wrote down the address. He 
had a feeling of nightmarishness. 
This was not Janice — • 

"I'm clearing up some matters 
you'll guess at," he said grimly, 
"so I may be a little while getting 
there. You'll wait?" 

He hung up. And then with a 
rather ghastly humor he took 
some pins from a box on the desk 
and worked absorbedly at bending 
one around the inside of the band 
of the seal ring he wore on his 
right hand. 



But he didn't go to the tele- 
phoned address. He went to the 
Breen Foundation. And Janice 
was there. She was the real Janice. 
He knew it instantly he saw her. 
She was panic-stricken when he 
told her of his own telephone ex- 
perience. Her teeth chattered. But 
she knew — instinctively, she said 
— that he was himself. She got 
into the cab with him. 

They reached the airport and 
found the office Hallen had 
named. The lettering on it, in 
Greek and French, said that it 
was a reception room for official 
visitors only. 

"Our status is uncertain," said 
Coburn drily. "We may be official 
guests, or we may be crazy. It's a 
toss-up which status sticks." 

He opened the door and looked 
carefully inside before he entered. 
Hallen was there. There was a 
lean, hard-bitten colonel of the 
American liaison force in Greece. 
There was a Greek general, pudgy 
and genial, standing with his back 
to a window and his hands clasped 
behind him. There were two 
Greek colonels and a major. They 
regarded him soberly. 

"Howdo, Coburn," said Hallen 
painfully. "You're heading for 
Athens, you know. This is Miss 
Ames? But these gentlemen have 
... ah ... a special concern 
with that business up-country. 
They'd like to hear your story 
before you leave." 

" I suppose," said Coburn 



128 



AMAZING STORIKS 



curtly, "it's a sort of preliminary 
commission in lunacy." 

But he shook hands all around. 
He kept his left hand in his coat 
pocket as he shook hands with his 
right. His revolver was in his left- 
hand pocket now too. The Greek 
general beamed at him. The 
American colonel's eyes were hard 
and suspicious. One of the two 
Greek colonels was very slightly 
cross-eyed. The Greek major 
shook hands solemnly. 

Coburn took a deep breath. "I 
know my tale sounds crazy," he 
said, "but ... I had a telephone 
call just now. Hallen will bear me 
out that my secretary was imper- 
sonated by somebody else this 
afternoon." 

"I've told them that," said 
Hallen unhappily. 

"And something was imper- 
sonating Dillon up in the hills," 
finished Coburn. "I've reason to 
believe that at this address" — 
and he handed the address he'd 
written down to Hallen — "a 
. . . creature will be found who 
will look most convincingly like 
Miss Ames, here. You might send 
and see." 

The American colonel snorted: 
"This whole tale's preposterous! 
It's an attempt to cash in on the 
actual mystery of what happened 
up-country." 

The Greek general protested 
gently. His English was so heavily 
accented as to be hard to under- 
stand, but he pointed out that 



Coburn knew details of the event 
in Naousa that only someone who 
had been there could know. 

"True enough," said the Ameri- 
can officer darkly, "but he can 
tell the truth now, before we make 
fools of ourselves sending him to 
Athens to be unmasked. Sup- 
pose," he said unpleasantly, "you 
give us the actual facts!" 

Coburn nodded. "The idea you 
find you can't take is that crea- 
tures that aren't human can be on 
Earth and pass for human beings. 
There's some evidence on that 
right here." He nodded to the 
Greek major who was the junior 
officer in the room. "Major, will 
you show these other gentlemen 
the palm of your hand?" 

The Greek major frowned per- 
plexedly. He lifted his hand and 
looked at it. Then his face went 
absolutely impassive. 

"I'm ready to shoot!" snapped 
Coburn. "Show them your hand. 
I can tell now." 

He felt the tensing of the others 
in the room, not toward the major 
but toward him. They were pre- 
paring to jump him, thinking him 
mad. 

But the major grinned ruefully: 
"Clever, Mr. Coburn! But how 
did you pick me out?" 

Then there was a sensation of 
intolerable brightness all around. 
But it was not actual light. It was 
a sensation inside one's brain. 

Coburn felt himself falling. He 
knew , somehow, that the others 



THE INVADERS 



129 



were falling too. He saw everyone 
in the room in the act of slumping 
limply to the floor — all but the 
Greek major. And Coburn felt a 
bitter, despairing fury as con- 
sciousness left him. 

IV 

He came to in a hospital room, 
with a nurse and two doctors and 
an elaborate oxygen-administering 
apparatus. The apparatus was 
wheeled out. The nurse followed. 
The two doctors hurried after her. 
The American colonel of the air- 
port was standing by the bed on 
which Coburn lay, fully dressed. 

Coburn felt perfectly all right. 
He stirred. The American colonel 
said sourly: "You're not harmed. 
Nobody was. But Major Pangalos 
got away." 

Coburn sat up. There was a 
moment's bare trace of dizziness, 
and that was gone too. Coburn 
said: "Where's Miss Ames? What 
happened to her?" 

"She's getting oxygen," said 
the colonel. "We were rushed here 
from the airport, sleeping soundly 
just like those Bulgarians. Major 
Pangalos ordered it before he dis- 
appeared. Helicopters brought 
some Bulgarians down, by the 
way, and oxygen brought them to. 
So naturally they gave us the same 
treatment. Very effective." 

The colonel looked both chas- 
tened and truculent. "How'd you 
know Major Pangalos for what he 



was? He was accepted every- 
where as a man." 

"His eyes *ere queer," said 
Coburn. He stood up experimen- 
tally. "I figured they would be, if 
one looked. I saw the foam suit 
that creature wore up-country, 
when he wasn't in it. There were 
holes for the eyes. It occurred to 
me that his eyes weren't likely to 
be like ours. Not exactly. So I 
hunted up the real Dillon, and his 
eyes weren't like I remembered. I 
punched him in the nose, by the 
way, to make sure he'd bleed and 
was human. He was." 

Coburn continued, "You see. 
they obviously come from a heavy 
planet and move differently, 
They're stronger than we are. 
Much like the way we'd be on the 
moon with one-sixth Earth grav- 
ity. They probably are used to a 
thicker atmosphere. If so, their 
eyes wouldn't be right for here. 
They'd need eyeglasses." 

"Major Pangalos didn't — " 

"Contact eyeglasses," said Co- 
burn sourly. "Little cups of plas- 
tic. They slip under the eyelids 
and touch the white part of the 
eye. Familiar enough. But that's 
not all." 

The American colonel looked 
troubled. " I know contact lenses," 
he admitted. "But -" 

"If the Invaders have a thick 
atmosphere at home," Coburn 
said, "they may have a cloudy 
sky. The pupils of their eyes may 
need to be larger. Perhaps they're 



130 



 



a different shape. Or their eyes 
may be a completely alien color. 
Anyhow, they need contact lenses 
not only to correct their vision, 
but to make their eyes look like 
ours. They're painted on the in- 
side to change the natural look 
and color. It's very deceptive. 
But you can tell." 

"That goes to Headquarters at 
once!" snapped the colonel. 

He went out briskly. Coburn 
followed him out of the room to 
look for Janice. And Janice hap- 
pened to be looking for him at 
exactly the same moment. He was 
genuinely astonished to realize 
how relieved he was that she was 
all right. 

He said apologetically : "I was 
worried! When I felt myself pass- 
ing out I felt pretty rotten at 
having failed to protect you." 

She looked at him with nearly 
the same sort of surprised satis- 
faction. "I'm all right," she said 
breathlessly. "I was worried about 
you." 

The roaring of motors outside 
the hospital interrupted them. 
More and more vehicles arrived, 
until a deep purring filled the air. 
A Greek doctor with a worried 
expression hurried somewhere. 
Soldiers appeared, hard-bitten, 
tough, professional Greek soldiers. 
Hallen came out of a hospital 
room. The Greek general appeared 
with one of the two colonels who'd 
been at the airport. The general 
nodded, and his eyes seemed cor- 

THE INVADERS 



dial. I Ie waved them ahead of 
him into a waiting elevator. The 
elevator descended. They went 
out of the hospital and there was 
an armored car waiting. An im- 
pressive escort of motorcycle 
troops waited with it.. 

The Greek general saw Co- 
burn's cynical expression at sight 
of the guards. He explained 
blandly that since oxygen brought 
sleeping Bulgarians out of their 
slumber — and had been used on 
them — oxygen was handy for use 
by anybody who experienced a 
bright flash of light in his mind. 
The Bulgarian soldiers, inciden- 
tally, said that outside the village 
of Ardea they'd felt as if the 
sunlight had brightened amaz- 
ingly, but they felt no effects for 
two hours afterward, when they 
fell asleep at Naousa. So, said the 
general almost unintelligibly, if 
anything untoward happened on 
the way to the airport, everybody 
would start breathing oxygen. A 
sensation of bright light would be 
untoward. 

The armored car started off, 
with motorcyclists crowded about 
it with weapons ready. But the 
ride in the airport was uneventful. 
To others than Janice and Coburn 
it may even have been tedious. 
But when she understood the 
general's explanation, she shiv- 
ered a little. She leaned insensibly 
closer to Coburn. He took her 
hand protectively in his. 

131 



They reached the airport. They 
roared through the gateway and 
directly out upon the darkened 
held. Something bellowed and 
raced down a runway and took to 
the air. Other things followed it. 
They gained altitude and circled 
back overhead. Tiny bluish Bick- 
erings moved across the overcast 
sky. Exhaust flames. 

Coburn realized that it was a 
fighter plane escort- 

The huge transport plane that 
waited for them was dark. They 
climbed into it and found their 
sells. When it roared clown the 
unhghted field and took to the 
air, everything possible had been 
done to keep anybody from bring 
ing any weapon to bear upon it. 

"All safe now!" said the voice 
of the American colonel in the 
darkness of the unlit plane, as the 
plane gained height. "Inciden- 
tally, Coburn, why did you want 
to look at Pangalos' palm? What 
did you expect to find there?" 

"When 1 started for the air- 
port," Coburn explained, "I bent 
a pin around the band of a ring I 
wear. I could let it lie flat when I 
shook hands. Or I could make it 
stand out like a spur. I set it with 
my thumb. I saw Pangalos' eyes, 
so I had it stand out, and I made a 
tear in his plastic skin when 1 
shook hands with him. He didn't 
feel it, of course." He paused. 
" Did anybody go to the address I 
gave Hallan ?" 

Hallan said, in the darkness: 



"Major Pangalos got there first." 

The blackness outside the plane 
seemed to grow deeper. There was 
literally nothing to be seen but the 
instrument dials up at the pilots' 
end of the ship. 

The Greek general asked a ques- 
tion in his difficult English. 

1 ' Where'd they come from ? " 
repeated Coburn. "I've no idea. 
Off Earth, yes. A heavy planet, 
yes. 1 doubt they come from our 
solar system, though. Somewhere 
among the stars." 

The Greek general said some- 
thing with a sly up-twist of his 
voice. Whatever and whoever the 
Invaders were, he said, they did 
not like Bulgarians. If they'd 
knocked out the raiding party 
simply to test their weapons 
against human subjects, at least 
they had chosen suitable and 
pleasing subjects for the test. 

There was light. For an instant 
Coburn tensed. But the plane 
climbed and the brightness stead- 
ied. It was the top of a cloud 
bank, brilliantly white in the 
moonlight. They had flown up 
through it, and it reached as far 
ahead as they could see. A stubby 
lighter plane swam up out of the 
mist and fell into position along- 
side. Others appeared- They took 
formation about the transport and 
all flew steadily through the 
moonlight. 

"I wish I knew," said the 
American colonel vexedly, "if 



132 



AMAZING STOKIKS 



those creatures were only testing 
weapons, or if they were getting 
set to start bargaining with us!" 

"Meaning?" asked Coburn. 

"If they're here," said the 
colonel angrily, "and if they do 
mean to meddle in our business, 
they may set up a sort of auction 
with us bidding against the Iron 
Curtain gang for their friendship. 
And they'd make any deal!" 

The Greek general agreed drily. 
He said that free people were not 
practical people. They were al- 
ways ready to die rather than 
cease to be free. Surely the 
Greeks had proved themselves 
ready to die. But people like the 
Bulgarians thought that to con- 
tinue to live was the most im- 
portant thing in the world. It was, 
of course, the practical view- 
point. . . . 

"They can have it!" growled 
Coburn. 

Janice said hesitantly: "But 
the Invaders haven't killed any- 
body we know of. They could 
have killed the Bulgarians. They 
didn't. The one who called him- 
self Dillon stopped one man from 
killing them. And they could have 
killed us, earlier today at the air- 
port. Could they want to be 
friends? " 

"They're starting the wrong 
way," said Coburn. 

The Greek general stirred in his 
seat, but he was pointedly silent. 

The pilot snapped abruptly 
from up at the bow of the plane: 



"Colonel! sir! Two of the fighters 
are climbing as if they've spotted 
something. There go the rest." 

Coburn leaned across Janice to 
stare out the window- When the 
fighters were below the transport, 
they could be seen in silhouette 
against the clouds. Above, their 
exhaust flames pin-pointed them. 
Small blue flames climbed steeply. 

The big ship went on. The roar 
of i ts motors was steady and 
unvarying. From a passenger seat 
it was not possible to look over- 
head. But suddenly there were 
streaking sparks against the stars. 
Tracer bullets. Fighters swerved 
and plunged to intercept some- 
thing. . . . 

And a Thing came down out of 
the sky with a terrific velocity. 
Tracer bullets sprayed all around 
it. Some could be seen to richochet 
off its sides. Flashings came from 
the alien craft. They were not ex- 
plosions from guns. They were 
lurid, actintic, smokeless blasts 
of pure light. The Thing seemed 
to be made of polished metal. It 
dodged, trying to approach the 
transport. The fighters lunged to 
prevent it. The ghastly game of 
interception seemed to rush here 
and there all over the sky. 

The strange object was not pos- 
sibly of human design or manu- 
facture. It had no wings. It left 
no trail of jet fumes or rocket 
smoke. It was glittering and mir- 
ror-like, and it was shaped almost 



THE INVADERS 



133 



exactly like two turtle-shells base 
to base. It was flat and oval. It 
had no visible external features. 

It flung itself about with in- 
credible darts and jerkings. It 
could stop stock still as no plane 
could possibly stop, and accelerate 
at a rate no human body could 
endure. It tried savagely to get 
through the swarming fighters to 
the transport. Its light weapon 
flashed — but the pilots would be 
_ wearing oxygen masks and there 
were no casualties among the hu- 
man planes. Once a fighter did 
fall off in a steep dive, and flut- 
tered almost down to the cloud 
bank before it recovered and came 
back with its guns spitting. 

That one appeared to end the 
fight. It came straight up, pump- 
ing tracers at the steel flier from 
below. And the glittering Thing 
seemed to stop dead in the air. 
Then it shuddered. It was bathed 
in the flaring sparks of tracers. 
Then — 

It dropped like a stone, tum- 
bling aimlessly over and over as it 
dropped. It plummeted into the 
cloud bank. 

Suddenly the clouds were 
lighted from within. Something 
inside flared with a momentary, 
terrifying radiance. No lightning 
bolt ever flashed more luridly. 

The transport plane and its 
escort flew on and on over the 
moonlit bank of clouds. 

Presently orders came by radio. 
On the report of this attack, the 



flight plan would be changed, for 
safety. If the air convoy had been 
attacked once, it might be at- 
tacked again. So it would be 
wisest to get it immediately to 
where there would be plenty of 
protection. Therefore, the trans- 
port plane would head for Naples. 

Nearly the whole of the United 
States Mediterranean fleet was in 
the Bay of Naples just then. It 
had been there nearly a week, and 
by day its liberty parties swarmed 
ashore. The merchants and the 
souvenir salesmen were entranced. 
American sailors had money and 
they spent it. The fleet's officers 
were social assets, its messes 
bought satisfyingly of local vi- 
ands, and everybody was happy. 

All but one small group. The 
newspapers of one of the Italian 
political parties howled infuri- 
atedly. They had orders to howl, 
from behind the Iron Curtain. 
The American fleet, that one 
party's newspapers bellowed, was 
imperialistic, capitalistic, and de- 
cadent. In short, there was viru- 
lent propaganda against the Amer- 
ican fleet in Naples. But most 
people were glad it was there any- 
way. Certainly nobody stayed 
awake worrying about it. 

People were staying awake 
worrying about the transport 
plane carrying Coburn and Janice, 
however. On the plane, Janice was 
fearful and pressed close to Co- 
burn, and he found it an absorbing 



134 



 



experience and was moved to fall; 
in a low tone about other matters 
than extra-terrestrial I n vaders 
and foam suits and interstellar 
travel. Janice found those other 
subjects surprisingly fitted to 
make her forget about being 
afraid. 

Elsewhere, the people who 
stayed awake did talk about just 
the subjects Coburn was avoiding. 
I he convoy carrying Cob urn to 
tell what he knew had been 
attacked. By a plane which was 
definitely not made or manned 
by human beings. The news 
Hashed through the air across 
continents. It went under the 
ocean over sea beds. It traveled 
in the tightest and most closely- 
guarded of diplomatic codes. The 
Greek government gave the other 
NATO nations a confidential ac- 
count of the Bulgarian raid and 
what had happened to it- These 
details were past question. The 
facts brought out by Coburn were 
true, too. 

So secret instructions followed 
the news. At first they went only 
to highly-trusted individuals. In 
thirty nations, top-ranking officials 
and military officers blindfolded 
each other in turn and gravely 
stuck pins in each other. The 
blindfolded person was expected 
to name (he place where he had 
been stuck. This had an historical 
precedent. In olden days, pins 
were stuck in suspected witches. 
They had patches of" skin in which 



I here was no sensation, and dis- 
covery of such areas condemned 
them to death. Psychologists in 
later centuries found that patches 
of anaesthetic skin were typical of 
certain forms of hysteria, and 
therefore did not execute their pa- 
tients. But the Invaders, by the 
fact that their seemingly human 
bodies were not flesh at all, could 
not pass such tests. 

There were consequences. A 
Minister of Defense of a European 
nation amusedly watched the 
tests on his subordinates, blandly 
excused himself for a moment be- 
fore his own turn came, and did 
not come back. A general of di- 
vision vanished into thin air. 
Diplomatic code clerks painstak- 
ingly decoded the instructions for 
such tests, and were nowhere 
about when they themselves were 
to be tested. An eminent Holly- 
wood director and an Olympic 
champion ceased to be. 

In the free world nearly a hun- 
dred prominent individuals simply 
disappeared. Few were in position 
to influence high-level decisions. 
Many were in line to know rather 
significant details of world affairs. 
There was alarm. 

It was plain, too, that not all 
disguised Invaders would have 
had to vanish. Many would not 
even be called on for test. They 
would stay where they were. And 
there were private persons. . . . 

There was consternation. But 



THE INVADERS 



135 



Janice, in the plane, was saying 
sof tl y to Coburn : 1 ' The — crea- 
ture who telephoned and said she 
was me. How did you know she 
wasn't ? " 

"I went to the Breen Founda- 
tion first," said Coburn. " 1 looked 
into your eyes — and they were 
right. So I didn't need to stick a 
pin in you." 

The thought of Coburn not 
needing to stick a pin in her im- 
pressed Janice as beautiful trust. 
She sighed contentedly. "Of 
course you'd know," she said. 
"So would I — now!" She laughed 
a little. 

The convoy flew on. The lurid 
round disk of the moon descended 
toward the west. 

"It'll be sunrise soon. But I 
imagine we'll land before dawn." 

They did. The flying group of 
planes flew lower. Coburn saw 
a single light on the ground. It 
was very tiny, and it vanished 
rearward with great speed. Later 
there was another light, and a 
dull-red glow in the sky. Still later, 
infinitesimal twinklings on the 
ground at the horizon. They in- 
creased in number but not in size, 
.and die plane swung hugely to the 
left, and the lights on the ground 
formed a visible pattern. And 
moonlight — broken by the shad- 
ows of clouds — displayed the 
city Mid the Bay of Naples below. 

The transport plane landed. 
The passengers descended. Co- 
burn saw Hallen, the American 



colonel, the Creek general, and a 
Greek colonel. The other had been 
left behind to take charge of 
things in Salonika. Here the uni- 
forms were American, and naval. 
There were some Italian police 
in view, but most of the men 
about were American seamen, os- 
tensibly on shore leave. But Co- 
bum doubted very much if they 
were as completely unarmed as 
men on shore leave usually are. 

A man in a cap with much gold 
braid greeted the American colo- 
nel, the Greek general, and the 
Greek colonel. He came to Co- 
burn, to whose arm Janice seemed 
to cling. 

"We're taking you out to the 
fleet. We've taken care of every- 
thing. Everybody's had pins stuck 
in him ! " 

It was very humorous, of 
course. They moved away from 
the plane. Surrounded by white- 
clad sailors, the party from the 
plane moved into the hangar. 

Then a voice snapped a startled 
question, in English. An instant 
later it rasped : "Stop or I'll 
shoot ! " 

Then there was a bright flash of 
light. The interior of the hangar 
was made vivid by it. It went out. 
And as it disapjieared there were 
the sounds of running footsteps. 
Only they did not run properly. 
They ran in great leaps. Impossi- 
ble leaps. Monstrous leaps. A 
man might run like that on the 
moon, with a lesser gravity. A 



 



creature accustomed to much 
greater gravity might run like 
that on Earth. But it would not 
be human. 
It got away. 

There was a waiting car. They 
got into it. They pulled out from 
the airport with other cars close 
before and behind. The cavalcade 
raced for the city and the shore- 
line surrounded by a guard less 
noisy but no less effective than 
the Greek motorcycle troopers. 

But the Greek general said 
something meditative in the dark 
interior of the car. 

' ' What's that ? ' ' demanded 
someone authoritatively. 

The Greek . general said it 
again, mildly. This latest attempt 
to seize them or harm them — 
if it was that — had been surpris- 
ingly inept. It was strange that 
creatures able to travel between 
the stars and put regiments and 
tanks out of action should fail so 
dismally to kill or kidnap Coburn, 
if they really wanted to. Could it 
be that they were not quite sin- 
cere in their efforts? 

"That," said the authoritative 
voice, "is an idea!" 

They readied the waterfront. 
And here in the darkest part of 
the night and with the moon near 
to setting, the waters of the Bay 
of Naples rolled in small, smooth- 
surfaced, tranquil waves. There 
was a Navy barge waiting. Those 
who had come by plane boarded 
it. It cast off and headed out into 



the middle of the huge harbor. 

In minutes there was a giant 
hull looming overhead. They 
stepped out onto a landing ladder 
and climbed interminably up the 
ship's metal side. Then there was 
an open door. 

"Now," said the American 
colonel triumphantly, "now ev- 
erything's all right! Nothing can 
happen now, short of an atomic 
bomb! " 

The Greek general glanced at 
him out of the corner of his eyes. 
He said something in that heavy 
accent of his. He asked mildly if 
creatures — Invaders — who 
could travel between the stars 
were unlikely to be able to make 
atom bombs if they wanted to. 

There was no answer. But some- 
body led Coburn into an office 
where this carrier's skipper was 
at his desk. He looked at Coburn 
with a sardonic, unfriendly eye. 

"Mr. Coburn, I believe," he 
said remotely. "You've been very 
welt staged-managed by your 
friends, Mr. Coburn. They've 
made it look as if they were trying 
hard to kill you, eh? But we know 
better, don't we? We know it's all 
a build-up for you to make a deal 
for them, eh? Well, Mr. Coburn, 
you'll find it's going to be a let- 
down instead ! You're not officially 
under arrest, but I wouldn't 
advise you to try to start any- 
thing, Mr. Coburn! We're apt to 
be rather crude in dealing with 
emissaries of enemies of all the 



THE INVADERS 



1,17

human race. And don't forget it!" 

And this was Coburn's first 
inkling that he was regarded as a 
traitor of his planet who had sold 
out to the Invaders. All the plans 
made from his information would 
be based on the supposition that 
he intended to betray mankind 
by misleading it. 

V 

It was not yet forty-eight hours 
since Coburn had been inter- 
rupted in the act of starting his 
car up in Ardea. Greek newspa- 
pers had splashed lurid headlines 
of a rumored invasion by Bul- 
garians, and their rumored defeat. 
The story was not widely copied. 
It sounded too unlikely. In a 
few hours it would be time for a 
new set of newspapers to begin to 
appear. Not one of them would 




print a single word about the most 
important disclosure in human 
history: that extra-terrestrial In- 
vaders moved blandly about 
among human beings without 
being suspected. 

The newspapers didn't know it. 
On inside pages and bottom cor- 
ners, the London papers might 
refer briefly to the remarkable 
rumor that had swept over Greece 
about an invasion force said to 
have crossed its border. The Lon- 
don papers would say that the 
Greek government officially de- 
nied that such a happening had 
taken place. The New York pa- 
pers would be full of a political 
scandal among municipal officials, 
the Washington papers would deal 
largely with a Congressional in- 
vestigation committee hearing, 
Los Angeles would have a new 
and gory murder to exploit, San 
Francisco news would be of a 
water-front strike, Tokyo would 
talk of cherry blossoms, Delhi 
of Pakistan, and the French press 
would discuss the political crisis. 
But no newspaper, anywhere, 
would talk about Invaders. 

In the United States radar 
technicians had been routed out of 
bed and informed that night 
fighters had had a fight with an 
alien ship manned by non-hu- 
mans and had destroyed it, but 
their radars detected nothing at 
all. An hour after sunrise in Naples 
they had come up with a combina- 



139 



tion of radar frequencies which 
were built to detect everything. 
Instructions were going out in 
code to all radar establishments 
on how to set it up on existing 
equipment. Long before that time, 
business machines had begun in- 
tricate operations with punched 
cards containing all known facts 
about the people known to have 
dropped out of sight. Other ma- 
chines began to integrate crackpot 
reports of things sighted in divers 
places. The stores of Hunter and 
Nereid rockets — especially the 
remote-control jobs — were brok- 
en out. Great Air Transport 
planes began to haul them to 
where they might be needed. 

In England, certain establish- 
ments that had never been men- 
tioned even in Parliament were 
put on war alert. There was fran- 
tic scurrying-about in France. In 
Sweden a formerly ignored scien- 
tist was called to a twice-scram- 
bled telephone connection and 
consulted at length about objects 
reported over Sweden's skies. 
The Canadian Air Force tumbled 
out in darkness and was briefed. 
In Chile there was agitation, and 
in Peru. 

' There was earnest effort to 
secure cooperation from behind 
the Iron Curtain, but that did not 
work. The Iron Curtain stood pat, 
demanding the most detailed of 
information and the privilege of 
inspecting all weapons intended 
for use against anybody so far 



unnamed, but refusing all infor- 
mation of its own. In fact, there 
was a very normal reaction every- 
where, except that the newspapers 
didn't know anything to print. 

These secret hassles were con- 
tinuing as the dawnlight moved 
over Italy and made Naples and 
its harbor quite the most beauti- 
ful place in the world. When day- 
light rolled over France, matters 
were beginning to fall into pat- 
tern. As daybreak moved across 
the Atlantic, at least the measures 
to be taken began to be visualized 
and orders given for their ac- 
complishment. 

And then, with sunrise in Amer- 
ica, real preparations got under 
way. 

But hours earlier there was con- 
sultation on the carrier in the Bay 
of Naples. Coburn sat in a ward- 
room in a cold fury which was in 
part despair. He had been kept in 
complete ignorance of all meas- 
ures taken, and he felt the raging 
indignation of a man accused of 
treason. He was being questioned 
again. He was treated with an icy 
courtesy that was worse than 
accusation. The carrier skipper 
mentioned with detachment that, 
of course, Coburn had never been 
in any danger. Obviously. The 
event in the airport at Salonika 
and the attack on the convoy 
were window-dressing. They were 
not attempts to withdraw him 
from circulation, but to draw at- 
tention to him. Which, of course, 



140 



AMAZING STOK1ES 



implied that the Invaders — who- 
ever or whatever they might be — 
considered Coburn a useful tool 
for whatever purpose they in- 
tended. 

Tins was before the conference 
officially began. It took time to 
arrange. There were radio tech- 
nicians with microphones. The 
consultation — - duly scrambled 
and re-scrambled — would be re- 
layed to Washington while it was 
on. It was a top level conference. 
Hallen was included, but he did 
not seem happy. 

Then things were ready. The 
skipper of the carrier took over, 
with full awareness that the very 
highest brass in Washington was 
listening to every word. 

"We can skip your technical 
information, Mr. Coburn," he 
said with ironic courtesy, "unless 
you've something new to offer." 

Coburn shook his head. He 
seethed. 

"For the record," said the skip- 
per, "J repeat that it is obvious 
that your presence at the scene 
when those Bulgarians were 
knocked out, that you were at- 
tacked in Salonika, that the ship 
carrying you was also attacked, 
and that there was an incident on 
your landing here: — it's obvious 
that all these things were stage-, 
managed to call attention to you, 
for the purposes of . . . whoever 
staged them. Have you anything 
more to offer?" 



"No," growled Coburn. "I've 
told all I know." He was furiously 
angry and felt completely help- 
less. 

"Your information, " purred the 
Skipper, "and the stage-managed 
incidents, make you look like a 
very patriotic citizen who is 
feared by the supposedly extra- 
terrestrial creatures. But we don't 
have to play any longer, Mr. Co- 
burn. What were you told to tell 
your government? What do these 
. . . extra-terrestrials want?" 

"My guess," snapped Coburn, 
"is that they want Earth." 

The skipper raised his eyebrows. 
"Are you threatening us in their 
name?" he asked, purring. 

"I'm telling you my guess," 
said Coburn hotly. "It's just as 
good as yours and no better! I 
have no instructions from them. 
1 have no message from them. 
I've only my own opinion, which 
is that we humans had better get 
ready to fight. I believe we ought 
to join together — all of Earth — 
and get set to defend ourselves." 

There was silence. Coburn found 
himself regarding the faces around 
him with an unexpected trucu- 
lcnce. Janice pressed his hand 
warningly. 

"AH of Earth," said the skipper 
softly. "Hmmmm. You advise an 
arrangement with all the earth. 
. . . What are your politics, Mr. 
Coburn? — No, let us say, what 
are the political views of the ex- 
tra-terrestrial creatures you tell 



Tirr; intvadilrs 



141 



us about? We have to know." 

Coburn seethed. " If you're sug- 
gest! rig that this is a cold war 
trick," he said furiously, " — if 
they were faking it, they wouldn't 
try tricks! They'd make war! 
They'd try conquest!" 

Coburn saw the stout Greek 
general nodding to himself. Bui 
the Skipper said suavely: "You 
were with one of the creatures, 
you say, up in the village of 
Naousa. Would you say he seemed 
unfriendly to the Bulgarians?" 

"He was playing the part of an 
Englishman," snapped Coburn, 
"trying to stop a raid, and mur- 
ders, and possibly a war — all of 
them unnecessary!" 

"You don't paint a frightening 
picture," complained the skipper 
ironically. " First you say we have 
to fight him and his kind, and then 
you imply that he was highly al- 
truistic. What is the fact?" 

"Dammit!" said Coburn. "I 
hated him because he wasn't hu- 
man. Jt made my flesh crawl to 
see him act so much like a man 
when he wasn't. But he made me 
feel ashamed when 1 held a gun on 
him and he proved he wasn't hu- 
man just so Janice — so Miss 
Ames wouldn't be afraid to drive 
down to Salonika with me!" 

"So you have some . . . 
friendly feelings toward him, eh? " 
the skipper said negligently. 
"How will you get in touch with 
his kind, by the way? //we should 
ask you to? Of course you've got 



it all arranged? Just in case,*' 

Coburn knew that absolutely 
nothing could be done with a man 
who was trying to show off his 
shrewdness to his listening supe- 
riors. He said disgustedly: "That's 
the last straw. Go to hell I" 

A loud-speaker spoke suddenly. 
Its tone was authoritative, and 
there were little cracklings of 
static in it from its passage across 
the Atlantic. 

"That line of questioning can 
be dropped, Captain. Mr. Coburn, 
did these aliens have any other 
chances to kill you?" 

"Plenty!" snapped Coburn. 
"And easy ones. One of them 
came into my office as my secre- 
tary. She could have killed me. 
The man who passed for Major 
Pangalos could have shot us all 
while we were unconscious. I 
don't know why they didn't get 
the transport plane, and I don t 
know what their scheme is. I'm 
telling the facts. They're contra- 
dictory. I can't help that. All I 
have are the facts." 

The loud-speaker said crisply: 
"The attack on the transport 
plane — any pilots present who 
were in that fight?" 

Someone at the back said: 
"Yes, sir. Here." 

"How good was their sh ip ? 
Could it have been a guided mis- 
sile? " 

"No, sir. No guided missile. 
Whoever drove that ship was 
right on board. And that ship was 



142 



 



good. It could climb as fast as we 
could dive, and no human could 
have taken the accelerations and 
the turns it made. Whoever drove 
it learned fast, too. He was clumsy 
at the beginning, but be learned. 
If we hadn't gotten in a lucky hit 
he'd've had us where he wanted 
us in a little while more. Our 
fiftv-calibres just bounced off that 
hull!" 

The loud-speaker said curtly: 
"If that impression is justified, 
that's the first business to be 
taken up. All but flying officers 
are excused. Mr. Coburn can go, 
too." 

There was a stirring everywhere 
in the room. Officers got up and 
walked out. Coburn stood. The 
Greek general came over to him 
and patted him on the shoulder, 
beaming. Janice went out with 
him. They arrived on the carrier's 
deck. This was the very earliest 
hour of dawn, and the conference 
had turned abruptly to a discus- 
sion of arms and tactics as soon as 
Washington realized that its 
planes were inadequate for fight- 
ing. Which was logical enough, 
but Coburn was pretty sure it was 
useless. 

"If anybody else in the world 
feels as futile as I do," said Co- 
burn bitterly, "I feel sorry for 
him!" 

Janice said softly: "You've got 
me." 

But that was less than complete 
comfort. It is inborn in a man that 



lie needs In feel superior. No man 
can feel pride before the woman 
of his choice while there is some- 
thing stronger than himself. And 
Coburn especially wanted to feel 
that pride just now. 

There were very probably dis- 
cussions of the important part of 
what Coburn had reported, of 
co u rse , during the rest of the 
morning. But there was much 
more discussion of purely military 
measures. And of course there 
were attempts to get military in- 
telligence. Things were reported 
in the sky near South Africa, and 
from Honolulu — - where nobody 
would ignore what a radar said 
again, especially the juiced-up 
eq uipmcn t j ust modified on or- 
ders — and from other places. 
Not all the reports were authentic, 
of course. If there were any ob- 
servations inside the Iron Curtain, 
the Iron Curtain countries kept 
them to themselves. Politics was 
much more important than any- 
thing else, in that part of the 
world. 

Hut Coburn need not have felt 
as futile as he did. There was just 
one really spectacular occurrence 
in connection with the Invaders 
that day, and it happened where 
Coburn was. Almost certainly, it 
happened because Coburn was 
there. Though there is reason to 
believe that the newspaper cam- 
paign on shore, declaring that the 
American fleet risked the lives of 
all Naples by its mere presence. 



THE INVADKRS 



143 



had something to do with it too. 
It was very spectacular. 

It happened just after midday 
when the city and its harbor were 
at their most glamorous. Coburn 
and Janice were above when it 
began. There was an ensign as- 
signed to escort Coburn about 
and keep an eye on him, and he 
took them on a carefully edited 
tour of the carrier. He took them 
to the radar room which was not 
secret any longer. He explained 
reservedly that there was a new 
tricked-up arrangement of radar 
which it was believed would de- 
tect turtle-shaped metal ships if 
they appeared. 

The radar room was manned, of 
course. It always was, with a cold 
war in being. Overhead, the bowl 
cages of the radars moved rest- 
lessly and rhythmically. Outside, 
on deck, the huge elevator that 
brought planes up from below 
rose at the most deliberate of 
peace-time rates. 

The ensign said negligently, 
pointing to the radar-screen: 
"That little speck is a plane mak- 
ing for the landing field on shore. 
This other one is a plane coming 
down from Genoa. You'd need a 
good pair of binoculars to see it. 
It's a good thirty-five miles away." 

Just then, one of the two radar- 
men on duty pushed a button and 
snapped into a microphone: "Sirl 
Radar-pip directly overhead! Does 
not show on normal radar. Ele- 



vation three hundred thousand 
feet, descending rapidly." His 
voice cut off suddenly. 

A metallic voice said : " Relay ! " 

The ensign in charge of Coburn 
and Janice seemed to freeze. The 
radar man pressed a button, which 
would relay that particular radar- 
screen's contents to the control 
room for the whole ship. There 
was a pause of seconds. Then bells 
began to ring everywhere. They 
were battle gongs. 

There was a sensation of stirring 
all over the ship. Doors closed 
with soft hissings. Men ran furi- 
ously. The gongs rang. 

The ensign said politely: "I'll 
take you below now." 

He led them very swiftly to a 
flight of stairs. There was a mon- 
strous bellowing on the carrier's 
deck. Something dark went hurt- 
ling down its length, with a tail of 
pale-blue flame behind it. It van- 
ished. Men were still running. 
The elevator shot into full-speed 
ascent. A plane rolled off it. The 
elevator dropped. 

An engine roared. Another. Yet 
another. A second dark and deadly 
thing flashed down the deck and 
was gone. There was a rumbling. 

The battle gongs cut off. The 
rumbling below seemed to in- 
crease. There was a curious vi- 
bration. The ship moved. Coburn 
could feel that it moved. It was 
turning. 

The ensign led them somewhere 
and said: "This is a good place. 



144 



AMAZING STORIICS 



You'd better stay right here." 

He ran. They heard him run- 
ning. He was gone. 

They were in a sort of ward 
room — not of the morning con- 
ference — and there were port- 
holes through which they could 
look. The city which was Naples 
seemed to swing smoothly past 
the ship. They saw other ships. A 
cruiser was under way with its 
anchor still rising from the water. 
It dripped mud and a sailor was 
quite ridiculously playing a hose 
on it. It ascended and swayed and 
its shank went smoothly into the 
hawse-hole. There were guns 
swinging skyward. Some were 
still covered by canvas hoods. The 
hoods vanished before the cruiser 
swung out of the porthole's line of 
vision. 

A destroyer leaped across the 
space they could see, full speed 
ahead. The water below them be- 
gan to move more rapidly. It 
began to pass by with the speed of 
ground past an express train. 
And continually, monotonously, 
there were roarings which cli- 
maxed and died in the distance. 

"The devil!" said Coburn. 
"I've got to see this. They can't 
kill us for looking." 

He opened the door. Janice, 
holding fast to his arm, followed 
as he went down a passage. An- 
other door. They were on the deck 
side of the island which is the 
superstructure of a carrier, and 

THE INVADERS 



they were well out of the way, 
and everybody in sight was too 
busy to notice them. 

The elevator worked like the 
piston of a pump. It vanished and 
reappeared and a plane came off. 
Men in vividly-colored suits 
swarmed about it, and the eleva- 
tor was descending again. The 
plane roared, shot rlown the deck, 
and was gone to form one of the 
string of climbing objects which 
grew smaller with incredible 
swiftness as they shot for the sky. 
Coburn saw another carrier. There 
was a huge bow-wave before it. 
Destroyers ringed it, seeming to> 
bounce in the choppy sea made 
by so many great ships moving so 
close together. 

The other carrier, too, was 
shooting planes into the air like 
bullets from a gun. The American 
Mediterranean fleet was putting 
out to sea at emergency-speed, 
getting every flying craft aloft 
that could be gotten away. A 
cruiser swung a peculiar crane- 
like arm, there was a puff of smoke 
and a plane came into being. The 
crane retracted. Another plane. 
A third. 

The fleet was out of the harbor, 
speeding at thirty knots, with 
destroyers weaving back and forth 
at higher speeds still. There were 
barges left behind in the harbor 
with sailors in them, — shore- 
parties or details who swore bit- 
terly when they were left behind. 
They surged up and down on the 

145 



melee of waves the fleet left 
behind in its hasty departure. 

On the fleet itself there was a 
brisk tenseness as it sped away 
from the land. Vesuvius still 
loomed high, but the city dwin- 
dled to a mere blinking mass of 
white specks which were its build- 
ings. The sea was aglitter with 
sunlight reflected from the waves. 
There was the smell of salt air. 

Men began to take cryptic 
measures for the future. They 
strung cables across the deck 
from side to side. Arresting gear 
for planes which would presently 
land. 

Their special ensign found Co- 
burn and Janice. "I'm supposed 
to stay with you," he explained 
politely. "I thought I could he of 
use. 1 'm really attached to another 
ship, hut I was on board because 
of the hassle last night." 

Coburn said: "This would be 
invader stuff, wouldn't it?" 

The ensign shrugged. "Appar- 
ently. You heard what the radar 
said. Something at three hundred 
thousand feet, descending rapidly. 
It's not a human-built ship. Any- 
way, we've sent up all our planes. 
Jets will meet it first, at fifty 
thousand. If it gets through them 
there are . . . other measures, 
of course." 

"This one beats me!" said Co- 
burn. "Why?" 

The ensign shrugged again. 
"They tried for you last night." 

"I'm not that important, to 



them or anybody else. Or am I?*' 
" I wouldn't know," said the 
ensign. 

" I don't know anything 1 
haven't told," said Coburn grimly, 
"and the creatures can't suppress 
any information by killing me 
now. Anyhow, if they'd wanted to 
they'd have done it." 

A dull, faint sound came from 
high overhead. Coburn stepped 
out from under the shelter of the 
upper works of the island. He 
stared up into the sky. He saw a 
lurid spot of blue-white flame. He 
saw others, lie realized that all 
the sky was interlaced with con- 
trails — vapor-trails of jet-planes 
far up out of sight. But thjsy were 
fine threads. The jets were up very 
high indeed. The pin-points of 
flame were explosions. 

"Using wing-rockets," said the 
ensign hungrily, "since fifty-cali- 
bres did no good last night, until 
one made a lucky hit. Rockets 
with proximity fuses. Our jets 
don't carry cannon." 

There were more explosions. 
There was a bright glint of re- 
flected sunshine. It was momen- 
tary, but Coburn knew that it 
was from a flat, bright space-ship, 
which had tilted in some mon- 
strously abrupt maneuver, and 
the almost vertical sunshine shone 
down from its surface. 

The ensign said in a very quiet 
voice: "The fight's coming lower." 

There was a crashing thump in 
the air. A battleship was firing 



146 



 



eight-inch guns almost straight 
up. Other guns began. 

Guns began to fire on the car- 
rier, too, below the deck and be- 
yond it. Concussion waves beat 
at Cobu rn 's body. He thrust 
Janice behind him to shield her, 
but there could be no shielding. 

The air was filled with barkings 
and snarlings and the unbelieva- 
bly abrupt roar of heavy guns. 
The carrier swerved, so swiftly 
that it tilted and swerved again. 
The other ships of the fleet broke 
their straight-away formation and 
began to move in bewildering 
patterns. The blue sea was criss- 
crossed with wakes. Once a de- 
stroyer seemed to slide almost 
under the bow of the carrier. The 
destroyer appeared unharmed on 
the other side, its guns all pointed 
skyward and emitting; seemingly 
continuous blasts of flame and 
thunder. 

The ensign grabbed Coburn 's 
shoulder and pointed, his hands 
shaking. 

There was the Invader ship. It 
was exactly as Coburn had known 
it would be. It was tiny. It seemed 
hardly larger than some of the 
planes that swooped at it. But the 
planes were drawing back now. 
The shining metal thing was no 
more than two thousand feet up 
and it was moving in erratic, un- 
predictable darts and dashes here 
and there, like a dragon-fly's 
movements, but a hundred times 



more swift. Proximity-fused shells 
burst everywhere about it. It 
burst through a still-expanding 
puff of explosive smoke, darted 
down a hundred feet, and took a 
zig-zag course of such violent and 
angular changes of position that it 
looked more like a streak of metal 
lightning than anything else. 

It was down to a thousand feet. 
It shot toward the fleet at a speed 
which was literally that of a 
projectile. It angled off to one side 
and back, and suddenly dropped 
again and plunged crazily through 
the maze of ships from one end to 
the other, no more than fifty feet 
above the water and with geysers 
of up-flung sea all about it from 
the shells that missed. 

Then it sped away with a veloc- 
ity which simply was not con- 
ceivable. It was the speed of a 
cannon ball. It was headed straight 
toward a distant, stubby, drag- 
gled tramp-steamer which plod- 
ded toward the Bay of Naples. 

It rose a little as it flew. And 
then it checked, in mid-air. It 
hung above the dumpy freighter, 
and there were salvoes of all the 
guns in the fleet. But at the 
flashes it shot skyward. When 
the shells arrived and burst, it 
was gone. 

It could still be sighted as a 
spark of sunlight shooting for the 
heavens. Jets roared toward it. It 
vanished. 

Coburn heard the ensign saying 
in a flat voice: "If that wasn't 



THE TNVADKHS 



14-7 



accelerating at fifteen Gs, I never 
saw a ship. If it wasn't acceler- 
ating at fifteen Gs . . ." 

And that was all. There was 
nothing else to shoot at. There 
was nothing else to do. Jets 
ranged widely, looking for some- 
thing that would offer battle, but 
the radars said that the metal 
ship had gone up to three hundred 
miles and then headed west and 
out of radar range. There had 
not been time for the French to set 
up paired radar-beam outfits any- 
how, so they couldn't spot it, and 
in any case its course seemed to be 
toward northern Spain, where 
there was no radar worth men- 
tioning. 

Presently somebody noticed the 
dingy, stubby, draggled tramp 
steamer over which the Invaders' 
craft had hovered. It was no 
longer on course. It had turned 
sidewise and wallowed heavily. 
Its bow pointed successively to 
every point of the compass. 

It looked bad. Salvos of the 
heaviest projectiles in the Fleet 
had been fired to explode a thou- 
sand feet above it. Perhaps — 

A destroyer went racing to see. 
As it drew near — Coburn learned 
this later — it saw a man's body 
hanging in a sagging heap over 
the railing of its bridge. There 
was nobody visible at the wheel. 
There were four men lying on its 
deck, motionless. 

The skipper of the destroyer 
went cold. He brought his ship 



closer. It was not big, this tramp. 
Maybe two thousand tons. It was 
low in the water. It swayed and 
surged and wallowed and rolled. 

Men from the destroyer man- 
aged to board it. It was completely 
unharmed. They found one small 
sign of the explosions overhead. 
One fragment of an exploded shell 
had fallen on board, doing no 
damage. 

Even the crew was unharmed. 
But every man was asleep. Each 
one slumbered heavily. Each 
breathed stertoriously. They could 
not be awakened . They would 
need oxygen to bring them to. 

A party from the destroyer 
went on board to bring the ship 
into harbor. The officer in charge 
tried to find out the ship's name. 

There was not a document to 
be found to show what the ship's 
name was or where it had come 
from or what it carried as cargo. 
That was strange. The officer 
looked in the pockets of the two 
men in the wheel house. There was 
not a single identifying object on 
cither of them. He grew disturbed. 
He made a really thorough search. 
Every sleeping man was abso- 
lutely anonymous. Then — still 
on the way to harbor — a really 
fine- tooth-comb examination of 
Lhe ship began. 

Somebody's radium-dial watch 
began to glow brightly. The 
searchers looked at each other and 
wen t pale. They hunted f ran-

tically, fear making them clumsy. 

They found it. Rather — they 
found them. 

The stubby tramp had an ade- 
quate if rather clumsy atomic 
bomb in each of its two holds. 
The lading of the ship was of ma- 
terials which — according to the- 
ory — should be detonated in 
atomic explosion if an atomic 
bomb went off nearby. Otherwise 
they could not be detonated. 

The anonymous tramp-steamer 
had been headed for the harbor of 
Naples, whose newspapers — at 
least those of a certain political 
party — had been screaming of 
the danger of an atomic explosion 
while American warships were 
anchored there. 

It was not likely that two atom 
bombs and a shipload of valuable 
secondary atomic explosive had 
been put on a carefully nameless 
ship just to be taken for a ride. If 
this ship had anchored among 
the American fleet and if it had 
exploded in the Bay of Na- 
ples . . . 

The prophecies of a certain 
political party would seem to have 
been fulfilled. The American ships 
would be destroyed. Naples itself 
would be destroyed. And it would 
have appeared that Europeans 
who loved the great United States 
had made a mistake. 

It was, odd, though, that this 
ship was the only one that the In- 
vaders' flying craft had struck 
with its peculiar weapon. 



VI 

We humans are rational beings, 
but we are not often reasonable. 
Those who more or less handle us 
in masses have to take account of 
that fact. It could not be ad- 
mitted that the fleet had had a 
fight with a ship piloted by In- 
vaders from another solar system. 
It would produce a wild panic, 
beside which even a war would be 
relatively harmless. So the ad- 
miral of the Mediterranean fleet 
composed an order commending 
his men warmly for their per- 
formance in an unrehearsed firing- 
driH. Their target had been — so 
the order said — a new type of 
guided missile recently developed 
by hush-hush agencies of the De- 
fense Department. The admiral 
was pleased and proud, and 
happy. . . . 

It was an excellent order, but 
it wasn't true. The admiral wasn't 
happy. Not after battle photo- 
graphs were developed and he 
could see how the alien ship had 
dodged rockets with perfect ease, 
and had actually taken a fi ve- 
inch shell, which exploded on 
impact, without a particle of 
damage. 

On the carrier, the Greek gen- 
eral said mildly to Coburn that 
the Invaders had used their power 
very strangely. After stopping 
an invasion of Greece, they had 
prevented an atomic-bomb ex- 
plosion which would have killed 



THE INVADERS 



149 



some hundreds of thousands of 
people. And it was strange that 
the turtle-shaped ship that had 
attacked the air transport was so 
clumsily handled as compared 
with this similar craft which had 
zestfully dodged all the missiles a 
fleet could throw at it. 

Coburn thought hard. "I think 
I see," he said slowly. " You 
mean, they're here and they know 
all they need to know. But instead 
of com tug ou t in to the open , 
they're making governments rec- 
ognize their existence. They're 
letting the rulers of Earth know 
they can't he resisted. But we did 
knock off one of their ships last 
night ! " 

The Greek general pointedly 
said nothing. Coburn caught his 
meaning'. The fleet, firing point- 
blank, had not destroyed its tar- 
get. The ship last night had seemed 
to fall into a cloud bank and ex- 
plode. But nobody had seen it 
blow up. Maybe it hadn't. 

"Humoring us!" realized Co- 
burn. "They don't want to de- 
stroy our civilization, so they'll 
humor us. But they want our 
governments to know that they 
can do as they please. If our gov- 
ernments know we can't resist, 
they think we'll surrender. But 
they're wrong." 

The Greek general looked at 
him enigmatically. 

"We've still got one trick left," 
said Coburn. "Atomic bombs. 
And if they fail, we can still get 



killed fighting them another way." 

There was a heavy, droning 
noise far away. It increased and 
drew nearer. It was a multi- 
engined plane which came from 
the west and settled down, and 
hovered over the water and 
touched and instantly created a 
spreading wake of foam. 

The fleet was back at anchor 
then. It was enclosed in the most 
beautiful combination of city and 
scene that exists anywhere. Be- 
yond the city the blunted cone of 
Vesuvius rose. In the city, news- 
paper vendors shrilly hawked de- 
nunciations of the American ships 
because of the danger that their 
atom bombs might explode. Well 
outside the harbor, a Navy crew 
of experts worked to make quite- 
impossible the detonation of 
atomic bombs in a stubby tramp- 
steamer which had — plausibly, 
at least — been sent to make 
those same newspapers' prophe- 
cies of disaster come true. 

A long, long time passed, while 
consultations took place to which 
Coburn was not invited. Then a 
messenger led him to the ward- 
room of the previous conference. 
He recognized the men who had 
landed by seaplane a while since. 
One was a cabinet member from 
Washington. There was someone 
of at least equal importance from 
London, picked up en route. There 
were generals and admirals. The 
service officers looked at Coburn 



L50 



 



with something like accusation in 
their eyes. He was the means by 
which they had come to realize 
their impotence. The Greek gen- 
eral sat quietly in the rear. 

"Mr. Coburn," said the Sec- 
retary from Washington, "We've 
been canvassing the situation. It 
seems that we simply are not pre- 
pared to offer effective resistance 

— not yet — - to the . . . invad- 
ers you tell us about. We know of 
no reason why this entire fleet 
could not have been disabled as 
effectively as the tramp-steamer 
offshore. You know about that 
ship?" 

Coburn nodded. The Greek 
general had told him. The Secre- 
tary went on painfully: "Now, 
the phenomena we have to as- 
cribe to Invaders fall into two 
categories. One is the category of 
their action against the Bulgarian 
raiding force, and today the pre- 
vention of the cold-war murder of 
some hundreds of thousands of 
people. That category suggests 
that they are prepared — on terms 

— to be amiable. A point in their 
favor." 

Coburn set his Hps. 

"The other group of events 
simply points you out and builds 
you up as a person of importance 
to these Invaders. You seem to be 
extremely important to them. 
They doubtless could have killed 
you. They did not. What they did 
do was bring you forward to offi- 
cial attention. Presumably they 



had a realistic motive in this. ' ' 

"I don't know what it could 
be,"" said Coburn coldly. " I 
blundered into one affair. I figured 
out a way to detect them. I hap- 
pened to be the means by which 
they were proved to exist. That's 
all. It was an accident." 

The Secretary looked skeptical. 
"Your discoveries were remark- 
ably . . . apt. And it does seem 
clear that they made the appear- 
ance of hunting you, while going 
to some pains not to catch you. 
Mr. Coburn, how can we make 
contact with them?" 

Coburn wanted to swear furi- 
ously. He was still being con- 
sidered a traitor. Only they were 
trying to make use of his treason. 

"I have no idea," he said 
grimly. 

"What do they want?" 

" I would say — Earth," he 
said grimly. 

' ' You deny that you are an 
authorized intermediary for 
them?" 

' ' Absolutely," said Coburn. 
There was silence. The Greek 
general spoke mildly from the 
back of the room. He said in his 
difficult English that Coburn's 
personal motives did not matter. 
But if the Invaders had picked 
him out as especially important, 
it was possible that they felt him 
especially qualified to talk to 
them. The question was, would he 
try to make contact with them? 

The Secretary looked pained, 



THE INVADERS 



151 



but he turned to Coburn. "Mr. 
Coburn?" 

Coburn said, " I've no idea how 
to set about it, but I'll try on one 
condition. There's one thing we 
haven't tried against them. Set 
up an aLom-bomb booby-trap, and 
I'll sit on it. If they try to contact 
me, you can either listen in or try 
to blow them up, and me with 
them !" 

There was buzzing comment. 
Perhaps — Coburn's nails bit into 
his palms when this was suggested 
— perhaps this was a proposal to 
let the Invaders examine an 
atomic bomb, American-style. It 
was said in earnest simplicity. 
But somebody pointed out that a 
race which could travel between 
the stars and had ships such as 
the Mediterranean fleet had tried 
to shoot down, would probably 
find American atomic bombs 
rather primitive. Still — 

The Greek general again spoke 
mildly. If the Invaders were to be 
made to realize that Coburn was 
trying to contact them, he should 
return to Greece. He should visi- 
bly take up residence where he 
could be approached. He should, 
in fact, put himself completely 
at the mercy of the Invaders. 

"Ostensibly," agreed the Sec- 
retary. 

The Greek general then said 
diffidently that he had a small 
villa some twenty miles from the 
suburbs of Salonika. The prevail- 



ing winds were such that if an 
atomic explosion occurred there, 
it would not endanger anybody. 
He offered it. 

"I'll live there," asked Coburn 
coldly, ' ' and wait for them to 
come to me? I'll have microphones 
all about so that every word that's 
said will be relayed to your re- 
corders? And there'll be a bomb 
somewhere about that you can set 
off by remote control? Is that the 
idea?" 

Then Janice spoke up. And Co- 
burn flared into anger against her. 
But she was firm. Coburn saw the 
Greek general smiling slyly. 

They left the conference while 
the decision was made. And they 
were in private, and Janice talked 
to him. There are methods of ar- 
gument against which a man is 
hopeless. She used them. She 
said that she, not Coburn, might 
be the person the Invaders might 
have wanted to take out of circu- 
lation, because she might have 
noticed something important she 
hadn't realized yet. When Coburn 
pointed out that he'd be living 
over an atomic bomb, triggered to 
be set off from a hundred miles 
away, she demanded fiercely to 
know if he realized how she'd feel 
if she weren't there to. . . . 

Next day an aircraft carrier 
put out of Naples with an escort 
of destroyers. It traveled at full 
speed down the toe of Italy's 
boot, through the straits of Mes- 
sina, across the Adriatic, and 



152 



 



rounded the end of Greece and 
went streaking night and day for 
Salonika. Special technicians sent 
by plane beat her time by days. 
The Greek general was there well 
ahead. And he expansively super- 
vised while his inherited, isolated 
vilka was prepared for the recep- 
tion of Invaders — and Coburn 
and Janice. 

And Coburn and Janice were 
married. It was an impressive 
wedding, because it was desirable 
for the Invaders to know about it. 
It was brilliantly military with 
uniforms and glittering decora- 
tions and innumerable important 
people whom neither of them 
knew or cared about. 

It it had been anybody else's 
wedding Coburn would have 
found it unspeakably dreary. The 
only person present whom he 
knew beside Janice was Hallen. 
He acted as groomsman, with the 
air of someone walking on eggs. 
After it was over he shook hands 
with a manner of tremendous re- 
lief. 

" Maybe I'll brag about this 
some day," he told Coburn un- 
easily. "But right now I'm scared 
to death. What do you two really 
expect to happen?" 

Janice smiled at him. "Why," 
she said, "we expect to live hap- 
pily ever after." 

"Oh yes," said Hallen uncom- 
fortably. "But that wasn't just 
what I had in mind." 



VII 

The world wagged on. The 
newspapers knew nothing about 
super-secret top-level worries. 
There was not a single newsstory 
printed anywhere suggesting an 
invasion of Earth from outer 
space. There were a few more 
Flying Saucer yarns than normal, 
and it was beginning to transpire 
that an unusual number of im- 
portant people were sick, or on 
vacation, or otherwise out of con- 
tact with the world. But, actually, 
not one of the events in which Co- 
burn and Janice had been con- 
cerned reached the state of being 
news. Even the shooting off the 
Bay of Naples was explained as 
an emergency drill. 

Quietly, a good many things 
happened. Cryptic orders passed 
around, and oxygen tanks were 
accumulated in military posts. 
Hunter and Mereid guided mis- 
siles were set up as standard equip- 
ment in a number of brand-new 
places. They were loaded for bear. 
-But days went by, and nothing 
happened. Nothing at all. But 
officialdom was not at ease. 

I f anything — - while the wide 
world went happily about its 
business — - really high-level offi- 
cialdom grew more unhappy day 
by day. Coburn and Janice flew 
back to Salonika. They went in 
a Navy plane with a fighter plane 
escort. They landed at the Salon- 
ika airport, and the Greek general 



THE INVADERS 



153 



was among those who greeted 
them . 

He took them out to the villa 
he'd placed at the disposal of 
high authority for their use. He 
displayed it proudly. There was 
absolutely no sign that it had 
been touched by anybody since 
its original builders had finished 
with it two-hundred-odd years 
before. The American officer who 
had wired it, though — he looked 
as if he were short a week's sleep 
— showed them how anywhere on 
the grounds or in the house they 
would need only to speak a code- 
word and they'd instantly be 
answered. 

There were servants, and the 
Greek general took Coburn aside 
and assured him that there was 
one room which absolutely was 
not wired for sound. He named it. 

So they took up a relatively 
normal way of life. Sometimes 
they decided that it would be 
pleasant to drive in to Salonika. 
They mentioned it, and went out 
and got in the car that went with 
the villa. Oddly, there was always 
some aircraft lazying about over- 
head by the time they were out of 
the gate. They always returned 
before sunset. And sometimes they 
swam in the water before the 
villa's door. Then, also, they were 
careful to be back on solid ground 
before sunset. That was so their 
guards out on the water wouldn't 
have to worry. 

But it was a nagging and an un- 



happy business to know that they 
were watched and overheard ev- 
erywhere save in that one unwired 
room. It could have made for ten- 
sion between them. But there was 
another thought to hold them 
together. This was the knowledge 
that they were literally living on 
top of a bomb. If an Invader's 
flying ship descended at the villa, 
everything that happened would 
be heard and seen by microphones 
and concealed television cameras. 
If the Invaders were too arrogant, 
or if they were arbitrary, there 
would be a test to see if their ship 
could exist in the heart of an atom- 
bomb explosion. 

Coburn and Janice, then, were 
happy after a fashion. But no- 
body could call their situation 
restful. 

They had very few visitors. 
The Greek general came out me- 
ticulously every day. Hallen came 
out once, but he knew about the 
atomic bomb. He didn't stay long. 
When they'd been in residence a 
week, the General telephoned 
zestfully that he was going to 
bring out some company. His 
English was so mangled and ob- 
scure that Coburn wondered cyni- 
cally if whoever listened to their 
tapped telephone could under- 
stand him. But, said the General 
in high good humor, he was play- 
ing a good joke. He had hunted 
up Helena, who was Coburn's 
secretary, and he had also invited 



154 



 



Dillon to pay a visit to some 
charming people he knew. Tt 
would be a great joke to see Dil- 
lon's face. 

There was a fire in the living 
room that night. The Greek serv- 
ants had made it, and Coburn 
thought grimly that they were 
braver men and women than he'd 
have been. They didn't have to 
risk their lives. They could have 
refused this particular secret- 
service assignment. But they 
hadn't. 

A voice spoke from the living- 
room ceiling, a clipped American 
voice. " Mr. Coburn, a car is 
coming." 

That was standard. When the 
General arrived; when the occa- 
sional delivery of telephoned-for 
supplies came; on the one occa- 
sion when a peddler on foot had 
entered the ground. It lacked 
something of being the perfect 
atmosphere for a honeymoon, but 
it was the way things were. 

Presently there were headlights 
outside. The Greek butler went to 
greet the guests. Coburn and 
Janice heard voices. The General 
was in uproarious good humor. 
He came in babbling completely 
uncomprehensible Knglish. 

There was Helena. She smiled 
warmly at Coburn. She went at 
once to Janice. "How dp you 
do?" she said in her prettily ac- 
cented English. "I have missed 
not working for your husband, but 
this is my fiance!" 



And Janice shook hands with a 
slick-haired young Greek who 
looked pleasant enough, but did 
not seem to her as remarkable as 
Coburn. 

Then Dillon stared at Coburn. 

"The devil ! " he said, with every 
evidence of indignation. "This is 
the chap — " 

The General roared, and Co- 
burn said awkwardly: "I owe you 
an apology, and the privilege of a 
poke in the nose besides. But it 
was a situation — I was in a 
state — " 

Then the General howled with 
laughter. Helena laughed. Her 
fiance laughed. And Dillon grinned 
amusedly at Coburn. 

"My dear fellow!" said Dillon. 
"We are the guests this whole 
villa was set up to receive! The 
last time I saw you was in Naousa, 
and the last time Helena saw you 
you stuck pins in her, and — " 

Coburn stiffened. He went 
slowly pale. 

"I — see! You're the foam-suit 
people, eh?" Then he looked with 
hot passion at the General. 
"You!" he said grimly. "You I 
didn't suspect. You've made fools 
of all of us, I think." 

The General said something ob- 
scure which could have been a 
proverb. It was to the effect that 
nobody could tell a fat man was 
cross-eyed when he laughed. 

" Yes," said Dillon beaming. 
"He is fat. So his eyes don't look 



THE INVADERS 



155 



like they're different. You have to 
see past his cheeks and eyebrows. 
That's how he passed muster. 
And he slept very soundly after 
the airport affair." 

Cob urn felt a sort of sick hor- 
ror. The General had passed as a 
man, and he'd loaned this villa, 
and he knew all about the in- 
stallation of the atomic bomb. 
. . . Then Coburn looked through 
a doorway and there was his 
Greek butler standing in readiness 
with a submachine-gun in his 
hands. 

" 1 take it this is an official 
call," said Coburn steadily. "In 
that case you know we're over- 
heard — or did the General can- 
cel that?" 

"Oh, yes!" said Dillon. "We 
know all about the trap we've 
walked into. But we'd decided 
that the time had come to appear 
in the open anyhow. You peopte 
are very much like us, inciden- 
tally. Apparently there's only 
one real way that a truly rational 
brain can work. And we and you 
Earth people both have it. May 
we sit down? " 

Janice said: "By all means!" 

Helena sat, with an absolutely 
human gesture of spreading her 
skirt beside her. The General 
plumped into a chair and chuc- 
kled. The slick-haired young man 
politely offered Janice a cigarette 
and lighted Helena's for her. 
Dillon leaned against the mantel 
above the fire. 



"Well?" said Coburn harshly. 
"You can state your terms. What 
do you want and what do you 
propose to do to get it?" 

Dillon shook his head. He took 
a deep breath. "1 want yon to 
listen, Coburn. I know about the 
atom bom b plan ted somcw 1 1 c re 
around, and I know I'm talking 
for my life. You know we aren't 
natives of Earth. You've guessed 
that we come from a long way off. 
We do. Now — we found out the 
trick of space travel some time 
ago. You're quite welcome to it. 
We found it, and we started ex- 
ploring. We've been in space, 
you might say, just about two of 
your centuries. You're the only 
other civilized race we've found. 
That's point one." 

Coburn fumbled in his pocket. 
He found a cigarette. Dillon held 
a match. Coburn started, and then 
accepted it. 

"Go on." He added, "There's a 
television camera relaying this, 
by the way. Did you know? " 

" Yes, I know," said Dillon. 
" Now, having about two cen- 
turies the start of you, we have a 
few tricks you haven't found out 
yet. For one thing, we understand 
ourselves, and you, better than 
you do. We've some technical 
gadgets you haven't happened on 
yet. However, it's entirely possi- 
ble for you to easily kill the four 
of us here tonight. If you do — 
you do. But there are others of 
our race here. That's point two." 



150 



 



" Now come the threats and de- 
mands," said Coburn. 

"Perhaps." But Dillon seemed 
to hesitate. " Dam mi t, Coburn, 
you're a reasonable man. Try to 
think like us a moment. What 
would you do if you'd started to 
explore spare and came upon a 
civilized race, as we have?" 

( 'oburn said formidably, "We'd 
study ihem and try to make 
friends." 

" In that order," said Dillon 
instantly. "That's what we've 
tried to do. We disguised our- 
selves as you because we wanted 
to learn how to make friends be- 
fore we tried. But what did we 



find. Coburn? What's your guess?" 

"You name it!" said Coburn. 

"You Earth people," said Dil- 
lon, "are at a turning-point in 
your history. Either you solve 
your problems and keep on climb- 
ing, or you'll blast your civiliza- 
tion down to somewhere near a 
caveman level and have to start 
all over again. You know what I 
mean. Our two more spectacular 
interferences dealt with it." 

"The Iron Curtain," said Co- 
burn. "Yes. But what's that got 
to do with you? It's none of your 
business. That's ours." 

"But it is ours," said Dillon 




urgently. "Don't you see, Co- 
bum? You've a civilization nearly 
as advanced as ours. If we can 
make friends, we can do each 
other an infinite lot of good. We 
can complement each other. We 

can have a inosL valuable trade, 
not only in goods, but in what you 
call human values and we call 
something else. We'd like to start 
that trade. 

"But you're desperately close 
to smashing things. So we've had 
to rush things. We did stop that 
Bulgarian raid. When you proved 
too sharp to be fooled, we grew 
hopeful. Here might be our enter- 
ing wedge. We hammered at you. 
We managed to make your people 
suspicious that there might be 
something in what you said. We 
proved it. It was rugged for you, 
but we had to let you people force 
us into the open, if we'd marched 
out shyly with roses in our hair — 
what would you have thought?" 

Coburn said doggedly: " I'm 
still waiting for the terms. What 
do you want? " 

The General said something 
plaintive from his chair. It was to 
the effect that Coburn still be- 
lieved that Earth was in danger of 
conquest from space. 

"Look!" said Dillon irritably. 
" If you people had found the trick 
of space travel first, and you'd 
found us, would you have tried to 
conquer us? Considering that 
we're civilized?" 

Coburn said coldly, "No. Not 



my particular people. We know 
you can' i conquer a civilized race. 
You can exterminate them, or 
you can break I hem down to 
savagery, but you can't conquer 
them. You can't conquer us!" 

Then I )illon said very pain* 
stakingly: " But we don't want to 
conquer you. Even your friends 
inside the Iron Curtain know that 
the only way to conquer a country 
is to smash it down to savagery. 
They've done that over and over 
for conquest. But what the devil 
good would savages be to us? We 
want someone to trade with. We 
can't trade with savages. We want 
someone to gain something from. 
What have savages lo oiler us? 
A planet ? Good Heavens, man ! 
We've already found sixty planets 
for colonies, much belter for us 
than Earth. Your gravity here is 
. . . well, it's sickeningly low." 

"What do you want then?" 

"We want to be friends," said 
Dillon. "We'll gain by it exactly 
what you Earth people gained 
when you traded freely among 
yourselves, before blocked cur- 
rencies and quotas and such non- 
sense strangled trade. We'll gain 
what you gained when you'd 
stopped having every city a fort 
and every village guarded by the 
castle of its lord. Look, Coburn; 
we've got people inside the Iron 
Curtain. We'll keep them there. 
You won't he able to disband your 
armies, but we can promise you 
won't have to use them — be-

cause we certainly won't help you 
chaps fight among yourselves. 
We'll give you one of our ships to 
study and work on. But we won't 
give you our arms. You'll have 
your moon in a year and your 
whole solar system in a decade. 
You'll trade with us from the time 
you choose, and you'll be roaming 
space when you can grasp the 
trick of it. Man, you can't refuse. 
You're too near to certain smash- 
ing of your civilization, and we 
can help you to avoid it. Think 
what we're offering." 

Then Coburn said grimly: "And 
if we don't like the bargain? What 
if we refuse?" 

Dillon carefully put the ash 
from his cigarette into an ashtray. 
"If you won't be our friends," he 
said with some distaste, "we can't 
gain anything useful from you. 
We don't want you as slaves. 
You'd be no good to us. For that 
reason we can't get anything we 
want from the Iron Curtain peo- 
ple. They've nothing to offer 
that we can use. So our ultimatum 
is — make friends or we go away 
and leave you alone. Take it or 
leave it!" 

There was a dead, absolute 
silence. After a long time Coburn 
said : " Altruism?" 

Dillon grinned. "Enlightened 
self-interest. Common sense!" 

There was a clicking in the ceil- 
ing. A metallic voice said: "Mr. 
Coburn, the conversation just 



overheard and recorded has to be 
discussed in detail on high dip- 
lomatic levels. Jt will take time 
for conferences — decisions — ar- 
rangements. Assuming that your* 
guests are acting in good faith, 
they have safe conduct from the 
villa. Their offer is very attractive, 
but it will have to be passed on at 
high policy-making levels." 

Dillon said pleasantly, to the 
ceiling: "Yes. And you've got to 
feeep it from being public, of 
course, until your space ships can 
discover us somewhere. It will 
have to be handled diplomatically, 
so your people are back of a grand 
offer to make friends when it 
happens." He added wryly," We're 
very much alike, really. Coburn's 
very much like us. That's why 
if it's all right with you — you 
can arrange for him to be our 
point of confidential contact. We'll 
keep in touch with him." 

The ceiling did not reply. Dillon 
waited, then shrugged. The Greek 
general spoke. He said that since 
they had come so far out from 
Salonika, it was too early to leave 
again. It might be a good idea to 
have a party. Some music would 
be an excellent thing. He said he 
liked Earth music very much. 

A long time later Janice and 
Coburn were alone in the one room 
of the house which was not wired 
for sound. There were no micro- 
phones here. 

Coburn said reluctantly in the

darkness: "It sounds sensible all 
right. Maybe it's true. But it feels 
queer to think of it. . . ." 

Janice pressed closer to him and 
whispered in his ear: "I made 
friends with that girl who passed 
for Helena. I like her. She says 
we'll be invited to make a trip to 
their planet. They can do some- 
thing about the gravity. And she 
says she's really going to be mar- 
ried to the . . . person who was 



with her. . . ." She hesitated. 
"She showed me what they really 
look like when they're not dis- 
guised as us." 

Coburn put hts arm around her 
and smiled gently. "Well? Want 
to tell me?" 

Janice caught her breath. " I — 
I could have cried. . . . The poor 
thing — to look like that. I'm 
glad I look like I do. For you, 
darling. For you." 



from the January 1850 issue of Scientific American: "It has been truly ob- 
served that the progress of science for the last century has outstripped all 
calculation, and left even the wildest imagination far in the rear. Is this 
astonishing progress to continue; and will nature in years to come yield to 
man her long treasured secrets as willingly as she dues now? If so, what 
mortal shall venture to limit the boundaries of human knowledge, or the 
power of human skill? 'There is indeed,' says a late writer, 'no reason why 
the earth should not supply us with water hot, as well as cold, anymore, 
perhaps, than why mechanical attrition or compressed air, should not keep 
us warm, and the electric fluid light our streets and houses, convey our mes- 
sages, set our clocks going, and possibly also perform some of our hard 
work.'" 



here's one place where the law of mathematics doesn't hold true: 2 plus 2 
equals 3^. When it's two quarts of water mixed with two quarts of alcohol. 
And the reason: Ethyl alcohol contracts in volume when you mix it with 
water, due to the reduction of the molecular interstices of the two sub- 
stances in the chemical combination.

PROJECT NIGHTMARE 
(Continued from page 39) 

Reynolds looked at the woman 
With him. "Dorothy Iirentano!" 

"Dorothy Smith now." 

He controlled his trembling and 
explained what was required. She 
nodded. "I figured that out on 
the plane. Got a pencil? Take this: 
St. Louis — a river warehouse 
with a sign reading 'Bartlett & 
Sons, Jobbers'. Look in the loft. 
And Houston — no, they got 
that one. Baltimore — it's in a 
ship at the docks, the S. S. Gold 
Coast. What other cities? I've 
wasted time feeling around where 
there was nothing to find." 

Reynolds was already shouting 
for Washington to answer. 

Grandma Wilkins was last to 
be relieved; Dorothy located one 
in the Potomac — and Mrs. Wil- 



kins told her sharply to keep try- 
ing. There were four bombs in 
Washington, which Mrs. Wilkins 
had known all along. Dorothy 
found them in eleven minutes. 

Three hours later Reynolds 
showed up in the club messroom, 
not having been able to sleep. 
Several of his people were eating 
and listening to the radio blast 
about our raid on Russia. I [e gave 
it a wide berth; they could blast 
Omsk and Tomsk and Minsk and 
Pinsk; today he didn't care. He 
was sipping milk and thinking 
that he would never drink coffee 
again when Captain Mikeler bent 
over his table. "The General 
wants you. Hurry!" 
"Why?" 

"I said, 'Hurry!' Where's 



161 



Grandma Wilkins — oh — see her. 
Who is Mrs. Dorothy Smith?" 

Reynolds looked around. "She's 
with Mrs. Wilkins." 

Mikelcr rushed them to Han- 
by's office. Hanby merely said, 
"Sit over there. And you ladies, 
(no. Stay in locus." 

Reynolds found himself looking 
into a television screen at the 
President of the United States. 
He looked as weary as Reynolds 
felt, but he turned on his smile. 
"You are Doctor Reynolds?" 

"Yes, Mr. President!" 

"These ladies are Mrs. Wilkins 
and Mrs. Smith?" 

"Yes, sir." 

The President said quietly, 



"You three and your colleagues 
will be thanked by the Republic. 
And by me, for myself. But that 
must wait. Mrs. Smith, there are 
more bombs — in Russia. Could 
your strange gift find them 
there?" 

"Why, I don't — I can try!" 

" Mrs. Wilkins, could you set 
off those Russian bombs while 
they are still far away?" 

Incredibly, she was still bright- 
eyed and chipper. "Why, Mr. 
President ! " 

"Can you? " 

She got .1 far-away look. " Doro- 
thy and I had better have a quiet 
room somewhere. And I'd like a 
pot of tea. A large pot." 



TURNOVER POINT 

(Continued from page 75) 



still at last. A wild-eyed thing 
dial may once have been a man 
stared in horror at the fading light 
of the yellow star far astern. 

It had taken Kane time to un- 
derstand what had happened to 
him, and now it was too late. 
Spac e had laken care of its own. 
The air in The Luck was growing 
foul and the food was gone. 
Death hung in the fetid atmos- 
phere of the tiny control room. 

The old man — the boy — the 
money. They all seemed to spin in 
a narrowing circle. Kane wanted 
suddenly to shriek with laughter. 
A circle. The turnover circle. The 
full circle that the old man had 



made instead of the proper half- 
turn of a turnover. Three hundred 
sixty degrees Instead of one hun- 
dred eighty. Three hundred sixty 
degrees to leave the nose of The 
Luck pointing outward toward the 
stars, instead of properly toward 
the Sun. A full circle to pile G 
on G until the Jovian moons were 
missed, and the Uranian moons 
and Triton, too. Ad Astra per 
Ardua. . . . 

With the last fragment of his 
failing sanity, Kane thought of 
how Pop Ganlon and the boy must 
be laughing. He was still thinking 
that as the long night closed in 
around him.
