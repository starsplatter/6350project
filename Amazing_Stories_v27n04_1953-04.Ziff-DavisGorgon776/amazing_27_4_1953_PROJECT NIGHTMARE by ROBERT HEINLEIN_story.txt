PROJECT NIGHTMARE by ROBERT HEINLEIN 



Anybody want a side bet on double deuces?" 
No one answered; the old soldier rattled dice in a glass, 
pitched them against the washroom wall. One turned up a 
deuce; the other spun. Somebody yelled, "It's going to 
five! Come, Phoebe!" 

It stopped — a two. The old soldier said, " I told you not 
to play with me. Anybody want cigarette money?" 
"Pick it up. Pop. We don't — oh, oh! 'Tcnshun!" 
In the door stood a civilian, a colonel, and a captain. The 
civilian said, "Give the money 
back, Two-Gun." 

"Okay, Prof." The old soldier 
extracted two singles. "That 
much is mine." 

"Stop!" objected the captain. 
"I'll impound that for evidence. 
Now, you men — " • 

The colonel stopped him. 
"Mick. Forget that you're ad- 
jutant. Private Andrews, come 
along." He went out; the others 
followed. They hurried through 
the enlisted men's club, out into 
<lesert sunshine and across the 
<juadrangle. 

The civilian said, "Two-Gun, 
what the deuce!" 

"Shucks, Prof, I was just prac- 
ticing." 

"Why don't you practice against 
Ocandma Wilkins?" 

The soldier snorted. " Do I look 
silly?" 

The colonel put in, "You're 
keeping a crowd of generals and 
"V.I.P.s waiting. That isn't bright." 

"Colonel Hammond, I was told 
to wait in the club." 

"But not in its washroom. 
Step it up!" 

They went inside headquarters 
to a hall where guards checked 
their passes before letting them 
in. A civilian was speaking: 
"—and that's the story of the 
history-making experiments at 
Duke University. Doctor Reyn- 
olds is back; he will conduct the 
demonstrations. " 

The officers sat down in the 



rear; Dr. Reynolds went to the 
speaker's table. Private Andrews 
sat down with a group set apart 
from the high brass and distin- 
guished civilians of the audience. 
A character who looked like a 
professional gambler — -and was 
■ — sat next to two beautiful red- 
heads, identical twins. A four- 
teen-year-old Negro boy slumped 
in the next chair; he seemed 
asleep. Beyond him a most wide- 
awake person, Mrs. Anna Wil- 
kins, tatted and looked around. 
In the second row were college 
students and a drab middle-aged 
man. 

The table held a chuck-a-luck 
cage, packs of cards, scratch pads, 
a Geiger counter, a lead carrying 
case. Reynolds leaned on it and 
said, "Extra-Sensory Perception, 
or E.S.P., is a tag for little-known 
phenomena — telepathy, clair- 
voyance, clairaudience, precogni- 
tion, telekinesis. They exist; we 
can measure them; we know that 
some people are thus gifted. But 
we don't know how they work. 
The British, in India during 
World War One, found that se- 
crets were being stolen by telep- 
athy." Seeing doubt in their faces 
Reynolds added, "It is conceiva- 
ble that a spy five hundred miles 
away is now 'listening in' — and 
picking your brains of top-secret 
data." 

Doubt was more evident. A 
four-star Air Force general said,

"One moment, Doctor — if true, 
what can we do to stop it?" 
" Nothing." 

"That's no answer. A lead- 
lined room ? " 

"We've tried that, General. No 
effect." 

"Jamming with high frequen- 
cies ; J Or whatever 'brain waves' 
are?" 

"Possibly, though I doubt it. 
If E.S.P. becomes militarily im- 
portant you may have to operate 
with all facts known. Back to our 
program: These ladies and gentle- 
men are powerfully gifted in tele- 
kinesis, the ability to control mat- 
ter at a distance. Tomorrow's ex- 
periment may not succeed, but 
wc hope to convince the doubting 
Thomases" — he smiled at a man 
in the rear — "that it is worth 
trying." 

The man he looked at stood up. 
"General Hanby!" 

An Army major general looked 
around. "Yes, Doctor Withers?" 

"I ask to be excused. My desk 
is loaded with urgent work — 
and these games have nothing to 
do with me." 

The commanding general started 
to assert himself; the four-star 
visitor put a hand on his sleeve. 
" Doctor Withers, my desk in 
Washington is piled high, but I 
am here because the President 
sent me. Will you please stay? 
I want a skeptical check on my 
judgment." 

Withers sat down, still angry. 



Reynolds continued : "We will 
start with E.S.P. rather than tele- 
kinesis — which is a bit different, 
anyhow." He turned to one of 
the redheads. "Jane, will you 
o i me here? " 

The girl answered, "I'm Joan. 
Sure." 

"All right — Joan. General La- 
Mott, will you draw something on 
this scratch pad?" 

The four-star flyer cocked an 
eyebrow. "Anything?" 

"Not too complicated." 

"Right, Doctor." He thought, 
then began a cartoon of a girl, 
grinned and added a pop-eyed 
wolf. Shortly he looked up. 
"Okay?" 

Joan had kept busy with an- 
other pad; Reynolds took hers to 
the general. The sketches were 
alike — ■ except that Joan had 
added four stars to the wolf's 
shoulders. The general looked at 
her; she looked demure. " I'm 
convinced," he said drily. "What 
next?" 

"That could be clairvoyance 
or telepathy," Reynolds lectured. 
"We will now show direct telep- 
athy." He called the second twin 
to him, then said, "Doctor With- 
ers, will you help us?" 

Withers still looked surly. 
"With what?" 

"The same thing — but Jane 
will watch over your shoulder 
while Joan tries to reproduce 
what you draw. Make it some- 
thing harder."

"Well . . . okay." He took t he 
pad, began sketching a radio cir- 
cuit while Jane watched. He 
signed it with a "Clem", the 
radioman's cartoon of the little 
fellow peering over a fence. 

"That's fine!" said Reynolds. 
''Finished, Joan?" 

"Yes, Doctor." He fetched her 
pad; the diagram was correct — 
but Joan had added to "Clem" 
a wink. 

Reynolds interrupted awed 
comment with, "I will skip card 
demonstrations and turn to tele- 
kinesis. "Has anyone a pair of 
dice? " No one volunteered ; he 
went on, "We have some supplied 
by your physics department. This 
chuck-a-luck cage is signed and 
sealed by them and so is this 
package." He broke it open, 
spilled out a dozen dice. "Two- 
Gun, how about some naturals?" 

"I'll try, Prof." 

"General LaMott, please select 
a pair and put them in this cup." 

The general com pi ied and 
handed the cup to Andrews. 
"What are you going to roll, 
soldier? " 

"Would a sixty-five suit the 
General?" 

" If you can." 

"Would the General care to 
put up a five spot, to make it in- 
teresting?" He waited, wide-eyed 
and innocent. 

La Mott grinned. "You're 
faded, soldier." He peeled out a 



five; Andrews covered it, rat- 
tled the cup and rolled. One die 
stopped on the bills — a five. 
The other bounced against a chair 
— a six. 

"Let it ride, sir?" 

"I'm not a sucker twice. Show 
us some naturals." 

"As you say, sir." Two-Gun 
picked up the money, then rolled 
6—1, 5-2, 4-3, and back again. 
He mlled several 6-ls, then got 
snake eyes. He tried again, got 
acey-deucey. He faced the little 
old lady. "Ma'am," he said, "if 
you want to roll, why don't you 
get down here and do the work?" 

"Why, Mr. Andrews!" 

Reynolds said hastily, "You'll 
get your turn, Mrs. Wilkins." 

" I don't know what you gentle- 
men are talking about." She re- 
sumed tatting. 

Colonel Hammond sat down by 
the redheads. "You're the Janu- 
ary Twins — aren't you?" 

"Our public!" one answered 
delightedly. 

"The name is 'Brown'," said 
the other. 

"'Brown'," heagreed, "but how 
about a show for the boys?" 

"Dr. Reynolds wouldn't like 
it," the first said dutifully. 

"I'll handle him. We don't get 
USO; security regulations are 
too strict. How about it, Joan?" 

"I'm Jane. Okay, if you fix it 
with Prof." 

"Good girls!" He went back to 
where Grandma Wilkins was dem- 



24 



 



onstrating selection — showers of 
sixes in the chuck-a-luck cage. 
She was still tatting. Dr. Withers 
watched glumly. Hammond said, 
"Well, Doc?" 

"These things are disturbing," 
Withers admitted, "but it's on 
the molar level — nothing affect- 
ing the elementary particles." 

"How about those sketches?" 

"I'm a physicist, not a psy- 
chologist. But the basic particles 
— electrons, neutrons, protons — 
can't be affected except with ap- 
paratus designed in accordance 
with the laws of radioactivity!" 

Dr. Reynolds was in earshot; at 
Withers' remark he said, "Thank 
you, Mrs. Wilkins. Now, ladies 
and gentlemen, another experi- 
ment. Norman!" 

The colored boy opened his 
eyes. "Yeah, Prof?" 

"Up here. And the team from 
your physics laboratory, please. 
Has anyone a radium - dial 
watch?" 

Staff technicians hooked the 
Geiger counter through an am- 
plifier so that normal background 
radioactivity was heard as oc- 
casional clicks, then placed a 
radium-dial watch close to the 
counter tube; the clicks changed 
to hail-storm volume. "Lights 
out, please," directed Reynolds. 

The boy said, "Now, Prof?" 

"Wait, Norman. Can everyone 
see the watch?" The silence was 
broken only by the rattle of the 
amplifier, counting radioactivity 



of the glowing figures. "Now, 
Norman ! " 

The shining figures quenched 
out; the noise died to sparse clicks. 

The same group was in a block- 
house miles out in the desert; 
more miles beyond was the bomb 
proving site; facing it was a peri- 
scope window set in concrete and 
glazed with solid feet of laminated 
filter glass. Dr. Reynolds was talk- 
ing with Major General Hanby. 
A naval captain took reports via 
earphones and speaker horn; he 
turned to the CO. "Planes on 
station, sir." 

"Thanks, Dick." 

The horn growled, ' ' Station 
Charlie to Control; we fixed it." 

The navy man said to Hanby, 
"All stations ready, range clear." 

"Pick up the count." 

"All stations, stand by to re- 
sume count at minus seventeen 
minutes. Time station, pick up 
the count. This is a live run. 
Repeat, this is a live run." 

Hanby said to Reynolds, " Dis- 
tance makes no difference?" 

"We could work from Salt Lake 
City once my colleagues knew the 
setup." lie glanced down. "My 
watch must have stopped." 

"Always feels that way. Re- 
member the metronome on the 
first Bikini test? It nearly drove 
me nuts." 

" I can imagine. Um, General, 
some of my people are high-strung. 
Suppose I ad lib?" 

Hanby smiled grimly. "We al- 



PROJECT NIGHTMARE 



ways have a pacifier for visitors. 
Doctor Withers, ready with your 
curtain raiser? " 

The chief physicist was bending 
over a group at instruments; he 
looked tired. "Not today," he 
answered in a flat voice. "Sat- 
terlee will make it." 

Satterlee came forward and 
grinned at the brass and V.t.P.s 
and at Reynolds' operators. "I've 
been saving a joke for an audience 
that can't walk out. But first — " 
He picked up a polished metal 
sphere and looked at the E.S.P. 
adepts. "You saw a ball like this 
on your tour this morning. That 
one was plutonium; it's still out 
there waiting to go bang! in about 
. . . eleven minutes. This is merely 
steel — unless someone has made 
a mistake. That would be a joke 
— we'd laugh ourselves to bits!" 

He got no laugh, went on; "But 
it doesn't weigh enough ; we're 
safe. This dummy has been pre- 
pared so that Dr. Reynolds' peo- 
ple will have an image to help 
them concentrate. It looks no 
more like an atom bomb than 1 
look like Stalin, but it represents 
- — if it were plutonium — -what 
we- atom tinkerers call a 'sub- 
-critical mass'. Since the spy trials 
everybody knows how an atom 
bomb works. Plutonium gives off 
neutrons at a constant rate. If 
the mass is small, most of them 
escape to the outside. But if it is 
large enough, or a critical mass, 
enough are absorbed by other 



nuclei to start a chain reaction. 
The trick is to assemble a critical 
mass quickly — then run for your 
life! This happens in microsec- 
onds; I can't be specific without 
upsetting the security officer. 

"Today we will find out if the 
mind can change the rate of neu- 
tron emission in plutonium. By 
theories sound enough to have 
destroyed two Japanese cities, the 
emission of any particular neu- 
tron is pure chance, but the total 
emission is as invariable as the 
stars in their courses. Otherwise 
it would be impossible to make 
a tom bombs. 

"By standard theory, theory 
that works, that subcritical mass 
out there is no more likely to 
explode than a pumpkin. Our test 
group will try to change that. 
They will concentrate, try to in- 
crease the probability of neutrons' 
escaping, and thus set off that 
sphere as an atom bomb." 

"Doctor Satterlee?" asked a 
vice admiral with wings. "Do you 
think it can be done?" 

''Absolutely not!" Satterlee 
turned to the adepts. " No offense 
intended, folks." 

" Five minutes! " announced the 
navy captain. 

Satterlee nodded to Reynolds. 
"Take over. And good luck." 

Mrs. Wilkins spoke up. "Just 
a moment, young man. These 
'neuter' things. I—" 

"Neutrons, madam." 



26 



 



"That's what I said. I don't 
quite understand. I suppose that 
sort of thing comes in high school, 
but 1 only finished eighth grade. 
I'm sorry." 

Satterlee looked sorry, too, but 
he tried. " — and each of these 
nuclei is potentially able to spit 
out one of these little neutrons. 
In that sphere out there" — he 
held up the dummy — "there are, 
say, five thousand billion trillion 
nuclei, each one — " 

"My, that's quite a lot, isn't 
it?" 

"Madam, it certainly is. 
Now — " 

" Two minutes!" 

Reynolds interrupted. " Mrs. 
Wilkins, don't worry. Concen- 
trate on that metal ball out there 
ami think about those neutrons, 
each one ready to come out. When 
I give the word, I want you all — 
you especially, Norman — to 
think about that ball, spitting 
sparks like a watch dial. Try for 
more sparks. Simply try. If you 
fail, no one will blame you. Don't 
get tense." 

Mrs. Wilkins nodded. " I'll 
try." She put her tatting down 
and got a faraway look. 

At once they were blinded by 
unbelievable radiance bursting 
through the massive filter. It beat 
on them, then died away. 

The naval captain said, "What 
the hell!" Someone screamed, 
" It's gone, it's gone!" 

The speaker brayed: "Fission 



at minus one minute thirty-seven 
seconds. Control, what went 
wrong. It looks like a hydro- 
gen — " 

The concussion wave hit and 
all sounds were smothered. Lights 
went out, emergency lighting 
clicked on. The blockhouse heaved 
like a boat in a heavy sea. Their 
eyes were still dazzled, their ears 
assaulted by cannonading after- 
noise, and physicists were elbow- 
ing flag officers at the port, when 
an anguished soprano cut through 
the din. "Oh, dear.' " 

Reynolds snapped, "What's the 
matter, Grandma? You all right?" 

"Me? Oh, yes, yes - but I'm 
so sorry. I didn't mean to do it." 

" Do what? " 

" I was just feeling it out, think- 
ing about all those little bitty 
neuters, ready to spit. But I 
didn't mean to make it go off — 
not till you told us to." 

"Oh." Reynolds turned to the 
rest. ' ' Anyone el se jump the 
gun?" 

No one admitted it. Mrs. Wil- 
kins said timidly, "I'm sorry, 
Doctor. Have they got another 
one? I'll be more careful." 

. Reynolds and Withers were 
seated in the officers' mess with 
coffee in front of them ; the phys- 
icist paid no attention to his. 
His eyes glittered and his face 
twitched. "No limits ! Calcula- 
tions show over ninety per cent 
conversion of mass to energy. 



I'ROJICCT NIGHTMARE

You know what that means? If 
we assume — no, never mind. 
Just say that we could make 
every bomb the size of a pea. 
No tamper. No control circuits. 
Nothing but ..." He paused. 
"Delivery would be fast, small 
jets — just a pilot, a weaponeer, 
and one of your 'operators'. No 
limit to the number of bombs. No 
nation on earth could — " 

"Take it easy," said Reynolds. 
"We've got only a few telekinesis 
operators. You wouldn't risk them 
in a plane." 

"But—" 

"You don't need to. Show them 
the bombs, give them photos of 
the targets, hook them by radio 
to the weaponeer. That spreads 
them thin. And we'll test for more 
sensitive people. My figures show 
about one in eighteen hundred." 

"'Spread them thin'," repeated 
Withers. "Mrs. Wilkins could 
handle dozens of bombs, one after 
another — couldn't she? " 

" I suppose so. We'll test." 

"We will indeed!" Withers no- 
ticed his coffee, gulped it. "For- 
give me, Doctor; I'm punchy. 
I've had to revise too many 
opinions." 

" I know. I was a behaviorist." 

Captain Mikelef came in, 
looked around and came over. 
"The General wants you both," 
he said softly. "Hurry." 

They were ushered into a 
guarded office. Major General 
Hanby was with General LaMott 



and Vice Admiral Keithley; they 
looked grim. Hanby handed them 
message flimsies. Reynolds saw 
the stamp TOP SECRET and 
handed his back. "General, I'm 
not cleared for this." 

"Shut up and read it." 

Reynolds skipped the number 
groups: " — (PARAPHRASED) 
RUSSIAN EMBASSY TODAY 
HANDED STATE ULTIMA- 
TUM: DEMANDS USA CON- 
VERT TO 'PEOPLE'S REPUB- 
LIC UNDER POLITICAL 
COMMISSARS TO BE AS- 
SIGNED BY USSR. MILI- 
TARY ASSURANCES DE- 
MANDED. NOTE CLAIMS 
MAJOR US CITIES (LIST SEP- 
ARATE) ARE MINED WITH 
ATOMIC BOMBS WHICH 
THEY THREATEN TO SET 
OFF BY RADIO IF TERMS 
ARE NOT MET BY SIXTEEN 
HUNDRED FRIDAY EST." 

Reynolds reread it — "SIX- 
TEEN HUNDRED FRIDAY" 
— two o'clock tomorrow after- 
noon, local time. Our cities booby- 
trapped with A-bombs? Could 
they do that? He realized that 
LaMott was speaking. "We must 
assume that the threat is real. 
Our free organ ization makes i t 
an obvious line of attack." 

The admiral said, "They may 
be bluffing." 

The air general shook his head. 
"They know the President won't 
surrender. We can't assume that 
Ivan is stupid." 



28 



 



Reynolds wondered why he was 
being allowed to hear this. La- 
Mott looked at him. "Admiral 
Keithley and I leave for Wash- 
ington at once. I have delayed to 
ask you this: your people set off 
an atom bomb. Can they keep 
bombs from going off?" 

Reynolds felt his time sense 
stretch as if he had all year to 
think about Grandma Wilkins, 
Norman, his othec paranornials. 
"Yes," he answered. 

LaMott stood up. "Your job, 
Hanby. Coming, Admiral?" 

"Wait!" protested Reynolds. 
"Give me one bomb and Mrs. 
Wilkins — and I'll sit on it. But 
how many cities? Twenty? 
Thirty?" 

"Thirty-eight." 

"Thirty-eight bombs — or 
more. Where are they? What do 
they look like? How long will this 
go on? It's impossible." 

"Of course — but do it any- 
how. Or try. Hanby, tell them 
we're on our way, will you?" 

"Certainly, General." 

"Good-by, Doctor. Or so long, 
rather." 

Reynolds suddenly realized that 
these two were going back to 
"sit" on one of the bombs, to 
continue their duties until it 
killed them. He said quickly, 
"We'll try. We'll certainly try." 

Thirty-eight cities . . . forty- 
three hours . . . and seventeen 
adepts. Others were listed in 



years of research, but they wera 
scattered through forty-one states. 
In a dictatorship secret police 
would locate them at once, deliver 
them at supersonic speeds. But 
this was America. 

Find them! Get them here! 
Fast! Hanby assigned Colonel 
Hammond to turn Reynolds' 
wishes into orders and directed 
his security officer to delegate his 
duties, get on the ph*one and use 
his acquaintance with the F.B.I., 
with other security officers, and 
through them with local police, 
to cut red tape and find those 
paranornials. Find them, convince 
them, bring pressure, start them 
winging toward the proving 
ground. By sundown, twenty- 
three had been found, eleven had 
been convinced or coerced, two 
had arrived. Hanby phoned Reyn- 
olds, caught him eating a sand- 
wich standing up. "Hanby speak- 
ing. The President just phoned." 

"The President?" 

"LaMott got in to see him. 
He's dubious, but he's authorized 
an all-out try, short of slowing 
down conventional defense. One 
of his assistants left National 
Airport by jet plane half an hour 
ago to come here and help. Things 
will move faster." 

But it did not speed things up, 
as the Russian broadcast was 
even then being beamed, making 
the crisis public ; the President 
went on the air thirty minutes 
later. Reynolds did not hear him;

he was busy. Twenty people to 
save twenty cities — and a world. 
But how? He was sure that Mrs. 
Wilkins could smother any A- 
bomb she had seen; he hoped the 
others could. But a hidden bomb 
in a far-off city — find it mentally, 
think about it, quench it, not for 
the microsecond it took to set one 
off, but for the billions of micro- 
seconds it might take to uncover 
it — was it possible? 

What would help? Certain 
drugs — caffeine, benzedrine. 
They must have quiet, too. He 
turned to Hammond, "t want a 
room and bath for each one." 

"You've got that." 

"No, we're doubled up, with 
semi-private baths." 

Hammond shrugged. "Can do. 
It means booting out some brass." 

" Keep the kitchen manned. 
They must not sleep, but they'll 
have to eat. Fresh coffee all the 
time and cokes and tea — any- 
thing they want. Can you put the 
room phones through a private 
switchboard?" 

"Okay. What else?" 

"I don't know. We'll talk to 
them." 

They all knew of the Russian 
broadcast, but not what was being 
planned; they met his words with 
uneasy silence. Reynolds turned 
to Andrews. "Well, Two-Gun?" 

"Big bite to chew, Prof." 

"Yes. Can you chew it?" 

"Have to, I reckon." 

"Norman?" 



"Gee, Boss! How can I when I 
ciin'i see 'em?" 

" Mrs. Wilkins couldn't see thai 
bomb this morning. You can't 
see radioactivity on a watch dial; 
it's too small. You just see the 
dial and think about it. Well?" 

The Negro lad scowled. " Think 
of a shiny ball in a city some- 
where?" 

"Yes. No, wait — Colonel 
Hammond, they need a visual 
image and it won't be that. There 
are atom bombs here — they must 
see one." 

Hammond frowned. "An Amer- 
ican bomb meant for dropping or 
firing won't look like a Russian 
bomb rigged for placement and 
radio triggering." 

"What will they look like?" 

"G-2 ought to know. 1 hope. 
We'll get some sort of picture, 
A three-dimensional mock-up, 
too. I'd better find Withers and 
the General." He left. 

Mrs. Wilkins said briskly, 
"Doctor, I'll watch Washington, 
D. C> 

"Yes, Mrs. Wilkins. You're 
the only one who has been tested, 
even in reverse. So you guard 
Washington ; it's of prime im- 
portance." 

"No, no, that's not why. It's 
the city I can see best." 

Andrews said, "She's got some- 
thing, Prof. I pick Seattle." 

By midnight Reynolds had his 
charges," twenty-six by now,

AMAZING STOKIES 



tucked away in the officers' club. 
Hammond and he took turns at 
a switchboard rigged in the upper 
hall. The watch would not start 
until shortly before deadline. Fa- 
tigue reduced paranormal powers, 
sometimes to zero; Reynolds 
hoped that they were getting one 
last night of sleep. 

A microphone had been in- 
stalled in each room; a selector 
switch let them listen in. Reyn- 
olds disliked this but Hammond 
argued, "Sure, it's an invasion of 
privacy. So is being blown up by 
an A-bomb." He dialed the switch. 
"Hear that? Our boy Norman is 
sawing wood." He moved it again. 
"Private 'Two-Gun' is still stir- 
ring. We can't let them sleep, 
once it starts, so we have to spy 
on them." 

" 1 suppose so." 

Withers came upstairs. "Any- 
thing more you need?" 

"I guess not," answered Reyn- 
olds. "How about the bomb 
mock-up? " 

"Before morning," 

"How authentic is it?" 

" Hard to say. Their agents 
probably rigged firing circuits 
from radio parts bought right 
here; the circuits could vary a lot. 
But the business part — well, 
we're using real plutonium." 

"Good. We'll show it to them 
after breakfast." 

Two-Gun's door opened. 
" Howdy, Colonel. Prof — it's 
there."

"What is?" 

"The bomb. Under Seattle. I 
can feel it." 

" Where is it? " 

"It's down — it feels down. 
And it feels wet, somehow. Would 
they put it in the Sound?" 

Hammond jumped up. "In the 
harbor — and shower the city 
with radioactive water!" He was 
ringing as he spoke. ' ' Get me Gen- 
eral Hanby ! " 

" Morrison here," a voice an- 
swered. "What is it, Hammond?" 

"The Seattle bomb — have 
them dredge for it. It's in the 
Sound, or somewhere under wa- 
ter." 

"Eh? How do you know?" 

''One of Reynolds' magicians. 
Do it!" He cut off. 

Andrews said worriedly, "Prof, 
I can't see it -I'm not a 'seeing- 
eye. ' Why don ' t you get one ? 
Say that little Mrs. Brentano?" 

"Oh, my God! Clairvoyants — 
we need them, too." 

Withers said, "Eh, Doctor? Do 
you think — " 

"No, I don't, or I would have 
thought of it. How do they search 
for bombs? What instruments?" 

"Instruments? A bomb in its 
shielding doesn't even affect a 
Ge'iger counter. You have to open 
things and look." 

"How long will that take? Say 
for New York!" 

Hammond said, "Shut up! 
Reynolds, where are these clair- 
voyants?" 



Reynolds chewed his lip. 
"They're scarce." 

"Scarcer than us dice rollers," 
added Two-Gun. "But get that 
Brentano kid. She found keys 1 
had lost digging a ditch. Buried 
three feet deep — and me search- 
ing my quarters." 

"Yes, yes, Mrs. Brentano." 
Reynolds pulled out a notebook. 

Hammond reached for the 
switchboard. "Morrison? Stand 
by for more names and even 
more urgent than the others." 

More urgent but harder to 
find; the Panic was on. The Presi- 
dent urged everyone to keep cool 
and stay home, whereupon thirty 
million people stampeded. The 
ticker in the P.I.O. office typed 
the story: "NEW YORK NY —

MORE— FLASH— " 

It was repeated everywhere. 
The Denver- Colorado Springs 
highway had one hundred thirty- 
five deaths by midnight, then 
reports stopped. A DC-6 at Bur- 
bank ploughed into a mob which 
had broken through the barrier, 
Tlx- Baltimore-Washington high- 
way was dogged • both ways; 
Memorial Bridge was out of serv- 
ice. The five outlets from Los An- 
geles were solid with creeping 
cars, At four a.m. EST the Presi- 
dent declared martial law; the 
order had no immediate effect. 

By morning Reynolds had 
thirty-one adepts assigned to 
twenty-four cities. He had a 
stomach-churning ordeal before 
deciding to let them work only 
cities known to them. The gam- 
bler, Even-Money Karsch, had 
settled it: "Doc, I know when 
I'm hot. Minneapolis luis to be 
mine." Reynolds gave in, even 
though one of his students had 
just arrived from there; he put 
them both on it and prayed that 
at least one would be " hot". 
Two clairvoyants arrived ; one, 
a blind newsdealer from Chicago, 
was put to searching there; the 
other, a camie mcntalist, was 
given the list and told to find 
bombs wherever she could. Mrs. 
Brentano had remarried and 
moved ; Norfolk was being combed 
for her. 

At one fifteen p.m., forty-five 



minutes before deadline, they 
were in their rooms, each with 
maps and aerial views of his city, 
each with photos of the mocked - 
u p bomb. The club was clear of 
residents; the few normals needed 
to coddle the paranormals kept 
careful quiet. Roads nearby were 
blocked; air traffic was warned 
away. Everything was turned to- 
ward providing an atmosphere in 
which forty-two people could sit 
still and think. 

At the switchboard were Ham- 
mond , Reynolds, and Gordon 
McClintock, the President's as- 
sistant. Reynolds glanced up. 
"What time is it?" 

"One thirty-seven,'* rasped 
Hammond. "Twenty-three min- 
utes." 

"One thirty-eight," disagreed 
McClintock. " Reynolds, how 
about Detroit? You can't leave it 
unguarded." 

"Whom can I tise? Each is 
guarding the city he knows best." 

"Those twin girls — I heard 
them mention Detroit." 

"They've played everywhere. 
But Pittsburgh is their home." 

"Switch one of them to De- 
troit." 

Reynolds thought of telling 
him to go to Detroit himself. 
"They work together. You want 
to get them upset and lose both 
cities?" 

Instead of answering McClin- 
tock said, "And who's watching 
Cleveland?" 



PROJECT NIGHTMARE 



33 



"Norman Johnson. He lives 
there and he's our second strong- 
est operator." 

They were interrupted by voices 
downstairs. A man came up, car- 
rying a bag, and spotted Reyn- 
olds. "Oh, hello, Doctor. What is 
this? I'm on top priority work — 
tank production — when the 
F.B.I, grabs me. You are responsi- 
ble?" 

"Yes. Come with me." McClin- 
tock started to speak, but Reyn- 
olds led the man away. "Mr. 
Nelson, did you bring your fam- 
ily?" 

"No, they're still in Detroit. 
Had I known — " 

"Please! Listen carefully." He 
explained, pointed out a map of 
Detroit in the room to which they 
went, showed him pictures of the 
simulated bomb. "You under- 
stand?" 

Nelson's jaw muscles were 
jumping. "It seems impossible." 

"It is possible. You've got to 
think about that bomb — or 
bombs. Get in touch, squeeze 
them, keep them from going off. 
You'll have to stay awake." 

Nelson breathed gustily. "I'll 
stay awake." 

"That phone will get you any- 
thing you want. Good luck." 

He passed the room occupied 
by the blind clairvoyant; the 
door was open. "Harry, it's Prof. 
Getting anything?" 

The man turned to the voice. 



" It's in the Loop. I could walk to 
it if I were there. A six-story 
building." 

"That's the best you can do?" 

"Tell them to try the attic. I 
get warm when I go up." 

"Right away!" He rushed back, 
saw that Hanby had arrived. 
Swiftly he keyed the communica- 
tions office. "Reynolds speaking. 
The Chicago, bomb is in a six- 
story building in the Loop area, 
probably in the attic. No — that's 
all. G'by!" 

Hanby started to speak; Reyn- 
olds shook his head and looked at 
his watch. Silently the General 
picked up the phone. "This is the 
commanding officer. Have any 
flash sent here." He put the phone 
down and stared at his watch. 

For fifteen endless minutes they 
stood silent. The general broke 
it by taking the phone and say- 
ing, "Hanby. Anything?" 

"No, General. Washington is 
on the wire." 

"Eh? You say Washington?" 

"Yes, sir. Here's the General, 
Mr. Secretary." 

Hanby sighed. "Hanby speak- 
ing, Mr. Secretary. You're all 
right? Washington ... is all 
right?" 

They could hear the relayed 
voice. "Certainly, certainly. 
We're past the deadline. But I 
wanted to tell you: Radio Moscow 
is telling the world that our cities 
are in flames." 



34 



 



Hanby hesitated. "None of 
them are?" 

"Certainly not. I've a talker 
hooked hi to GHQ, which has an 
open line to every city listed. AH 
safe. I don't know whether your 
freak people did any good but, 
one way or another, it was a 
false- — ■*' The line went dead. 

I I an by 's face went dead with it. 
He jiggled the phone. "I've been 
cut off!" 

" Not here, General — at the 
other end. Just a moment." 

They waited. Presently the op- 
erator said, "Sorry, sir. I can't 
gL-t them to answer " 

"Keep trying!" 

It was slightly over a minute — 
it merely seemed longer — when 
the operator said, "Here's your 
party, sir." 

"That you, Hanby?" came the 
voice. " I suppose we'll have 
phone troubles just as we had last 
time. Now, about these ESP peo- 
ple: while we are grateful and all 
that, nevertheless I suggest that 
nothing be released to the papers. 
Might be misinterpreted." 

"Oh. Is that an order, Mr. 
Secretary?" 

"Oh, no, no! But have such 
things routed through my office." 

"Yes, sir." He cradled the 
phone. 

McClintock said, "You should- 
n't have rung off. General. I'd 
like to know whether the Chief 
wants this business continued." 

"Suppose we talk about it on 



the way back to my office." The 
General urged him away, turned 
and gave Reynolds a solemn wink. 

Trays were placed outside the 
doors at six o'clock; most of them 
sent for coffee during the evening. 
M rs. Wi 1 k i n s ordered tea ; she 
kept her door open and chatted 
with anyone who passed. Harry 
the newsboy was searching Mil- 
waukee-; no answer had been re- 
ceived from his tip about Chicago. 
Mrs. Ekstein, or "Princess Ca- 
thay" as she was billed, had re- 
ported a "feeling" about a house 
trailer in Denver and was now 
poring over a map of New Or- 
leans. With the passing of the 
deadline panic abated; communi- 
cations were improving. The 
American people were telling each 
other that they had known that 
those damned commies were bluff- 
ing. 

Hammond and Reynolds sent 
for more coffee at three a.m. ; 
Reynolds' hand trembled as he 
poured. Hammond said, "You 
haven't slept for two nights. Get 
over on that divan." 

"Neither have you." 

"I'll sleep when you wake up." 

"I can't sleep. I'm worrying 
about what'll happen when they 
get sleepy." He gestured at the 
line of doors. 

"So am I." 

At seven a.m. Two-Gun came 
out. " Prof, they got it. The bomb. 
It's gone. Like closing your hand 
on nothing." 



PROJECT NIGHTMARE 



Hammond grabbed the phone. 
"Get me Seattle — the F.B.I, 
office." 

While they waited, Two-Gun 
said, "What now, Prof?" 

Reynolds tried to think. " May- 
be you should rest." 

"Not until this is over. Who's 
got Toledo? I know that burg." 

"Uh . . . young Barnes." 

Hammond was connected; he 
identified himself, asked the ques- 
tion. He put the phone down 
gently. "They did get it," he 
whispered. "It was in the lake." 

" I told you it was wet," 
agreed Two-Gun. "Now, about 
Toledo — " 

"Well . . . tell me when you've 
got it and we'll let Barnes rest." 

McCIintock rushed in at seven 
thirty-five, followed by Hanby. 
"Doctor Reynolds! Colonel Ham- 
mond!" 

" Sh! Quiet! You'll disturb 
them." 

McCIintock said in a lower 
voice, "Yes, surely — I was ex- 
cited. This is important. They 
located a bomb in Seattle and — " 

"Yes. Private Andrews told 
us." 

"Huh? How did he know?" 

"Never mind," Hanby inter- 
vened. "The point is, they found 
the bomb already triggered. Now 
we know that your people are 
protecting the cities." 

"Was there any doubt?" 

"Well . . . yes." 

"But there isn't now," McCIin- 



tock added. "I must take over." 
He bent over the board. "Com- 
munications? Put that White 
House line through here." 

"Just what," Reynolds said 
slowly, "do you mean by 'take 
over'?" 

"Eh? Why, take charge on be- 
half of the President. Make sure 
these people don't let down an 
instant!" 

"But what do you propose to 

&o?" 

Hanby said hastily, "Nothing, 
Doctor. We'll just keep in touch 
with Washington from here." 

They continued the vigil to- 
gether; Reynolds spent the time 
hating McClintock's guts. He 
started to take coffee, then de- 
cided on another benzedrine tablet 
instead. He hoped his people were 
taking enough of it — and not 
too much. They all had it, except 
Grandma Wilkins, who wouldn't 
touch it. He wanted to check with 
them but knew that he could not 
— each bomb was bound only by 
a thread of thought; a split-split 
second of diversion might be 
enough. 

The outside light flashed; Han- 
by took the call. "Congress has 
recessed," he announced, "and 
the President is handing the So- 
viet Union a counter ultimatum ; 
locate and disarm any bombs or 
be bombed in return." The light 
flashed again; Hanby answered. 
His face lit up. " Two more 



36 



 



found, " he told them. "One in 
Chicago, right where your man 
said; the other in Camden." 

"Camden? How?" 

"They rounded up the known 
Communists, of course. This lad- 
die was brought back there for 
questioning, He didn't like that; 
he knew that he was being held 
leas than a mile from the bomb. 
Who is on Camden?" 

"Mr. Dimwiddy." 

"The elderly man with the 
bunions? " 

"That's right — retired post- 
man. General, do we assume that 
there is only one bomb per city? " 

McCHntock answered, "Of 
course not! These people must — " 

Hanby cut in, "Central Intelli- 
gence is assuming so, except for 
New York and Washington. If 
they had more bombs here, they 
would have added more cities." 

Reynolds left to take Dim- 
widdy off watch. McCHntock, he 
fumed, did not realize that people 
were flesh and blood. 

Dimwiddy was unsurprised. "A 
while ago the pressure let up, then 
— well, I'm afraid I dozed. I had 
a terrible feeling that I had let it 
go off, then I knew it hadn't." 
Reynolds told him to rest, then 
be ready to help out elsewhere. 
They settled on Philadelphia ; 
Dimwiddy had once lived there. 

The watch continued. Mrs. 
Ekstein came up with three hits, 
but no answers came back; Reyn- 
olds still had to keep those cities 



covered. She then complained 
that her "sight" had gone; Reyn- 
olds went to her room and told 
her to nap, not wishing to consult 
McCHntock. 

Luncheon trays came and went. 
Reynolds continued worrying over 
how to arrange his operators to 
let them rest. Forty-three people 
and thirty-five cities — if only he 
had two for every city! Maybe 
any of them could watch any 
city? No, he could not chance it. 

Barnes woke up and took back 
Toledo; that left Two-Gun free. 
Should he let him take Cleveland? 
Norman had had no relief and 
Two-Gun had once been through 
it, on a train. The colored boy 
was amazing but rather hyster- 
ical, whereas Two-Gun — well, 
Reynolds felt that Two-Gun 
would last, even through a week 
of no sleep. 

No! He couldn't trust Cleve- 
land to a man who had merely 
passed through it. But with Dim- 
widdy on Philadelphia, when 
Mary Gifford woke he could put 
her on Houston and that would 
let Hank sleep before shifting 
him to Indianapolis and that 
would let him — 

A chess game, with all pawns 
queens and no mistakes allowed. 

McClintock was twiddling the 
selector switch, listening in. Sud- 
denly he snapped, "Someone is 
asleep!" 

Reynolds checked the number. 



PROJECT NIGHTMARE

"Of course, that's the twins' 
room; they take turns. You may 
hear snores in 21 and 30 and 8 
and 19. It's okay; they're off 
watch." 

"Well, all right" McCIintock 
seemed annoyed. 

Reynolds bent back to his 
list. Shortly McCIintock snorted, 
"Who's in room 12?" 

"Uh? Wait — that's Norman 
Johnson, Cleveland." 

" You mean he's on watch?" 

"Yes." Reynolds could hear 
the boy's asthmatic breathing, 
felt relieved. 

" lie's asleep!" 

" No, he's not." 

But McCIintock was rushing 
down the corridor. Reynolds took 
after him; Hammond and Hanby 
followed. Reynolds caught up as 
McCIintock burst into room 12. 
Norman was sprawled in a chair, 
eyes closed in his habitual at- 
titude, McCIintock rushed up, 
slapped hint. "Wake up!" 

Reynolds grabbed McCIintock. 
"You bloody fool!" 

Norman opened his eyes, then 
burst into tears. "It's gone!" 

"Steady, Norman. It's all 
right." 

'.'No, no! It's gone — and my 
mammy's gone with it!" 

McCIintock snapped, "Concen- 
trate, boy! Get back on it!" 

Reynolds turned on him. "Get 
out. Get out before I punch you." 

Hanby and Hammond were in 
the door; the General cut in with 



a hoarse whisper. " Pipe down 
Doctor, bring the boy." 

Back at the board the outside 
light was flashing. Hanby took 
the call while Reynolds tried to 
quiet the boy. Hanby listened 
gravely, then said, " He's right. 
Cleveland just got it." 

McCIintock snapped, "He went 
to sleep. He ought to be shot." 

"Shut up," said Hanby. 

"But—" 

Reynolds said, "Any others. 
General? " 

"Why would there be?" 

"All this racket. It may have 
disturbed a dozen of them." 

"Oh, we'll see." He called 
Washington again. Presently he 
sighed. "No, just Cleveland. We 
were . . . lucky." 

" General," McCIintock in- 
sisted, "he was asleep." 

Hanby looked at him. "Sir, you 
may be the President's deputy, 
but you yourself have no military 
authority. Off my post." 

"But I am directed by the 
President to — " 

"Off my post, sir! Go back to 
Washington. Or to Cleveland." 

McCIintock looked dumb- 
founded. Hanby added, "You're 
worse than bad — you're a fool." 

"The President will hear of 
this." 

"Blunder again and the Presi- 
dent won't live that long. Get out." 

By nightfall the situation was 
rapidly getting worse. Twenty- 
seven cities were still threatened 



38 



 



and Reynolds was losing operators 
faster than bombs were being 
found. Even- M oney Karsch 
would not relieve when awak- 
ened. "See that?" he said, rolling 
dice. " Cold as a well-digger's feet. 
I'm through." After that Reyn- 
olds tested each one who was 
about to relieve, found that some 
were tired beyond the power of 
short sleep to restore them — 
they were "cold". 

By midnight there were eight- 
een operators for nineteen cities. 
The twins he had fearfully split 
up; it had worked. Mrs. Wilkins 
was holding both Washington and 
Baltimore; she had taken Balti- 
more when he had no one to re- 
lieve there. 

But now he had no one for re- 
lief anywhere and three operators 
— Nelson, Two-Gun and Grand- 
ma Wilkins — had had no rest. 
He was too fagged to worry; he 
simply knew that whenever one 
of them reached his limit, the 
United States would lose a city. 
The panic had resumed after the 
bombing of Cleveland ; roads again 
were choked. The disorder made 
harder the search for bombs. But 
there was nothing he could do. 

Mrs. Ekstein still complained 
about her sight but kept at it. 
Harry the newsboy had had no 
luck with Milwaukee, but there 
was no use shifting him ; other cit- 
ies were "dark" to him. During 
the night Mrs. Ekstein pointed to 
the bomb in Houston. It was, she 



said, in a box underground. A 
coffin? Yes, there was a headstone ; 
she was unable to read the name. 

Thus, many recent dead in 
Houston were disturbed. But it 
was nine Sunday morning before 
Reynolds went to tell Mary Gil- 
ford that she could rest — or re- 
lieve for Wilmington, if she felt 
up to it. He found her collapsed 
and lifted her onto the bed, won- 
dering if she had known the 
Houston bomb was found. 

Eleven cities now and eight 
people. Grandma Wilkins held 
four cities. No one else had been 
able to double up. Reynolds 
thought dully that it was a mira- 
cle that they had been able to 
last at all ; it surpassed enormously 
the best test performance. 

Hammond looked up as he re- 
turned. "Make anv changes?" 

"No. The Gifford kid is 
through. We'll lose half a dozen 
cities before this is over." 

"Some of them must be damn 
near empty by now." 

"I hope so. Any more bombs 
found?" 

"Not yet. How do you feel, 
Doc?" 

"Three weeks dead." Reynolds 
sat down wearily. He was wonder- 
ing if he should wake some of 
those sleeping and test them again 
when he heard a noise below; he 
went to the stairwell. 

Up came an M.P. captain. 
"They said to bring her here." 
Reynolds looked at the woman 
With him. "Dorothy Iirentano!" 

"Dorothy Smith now." 

He controlled his trembling and 
explained what was required. She 
nodded. "I figured that out on 
the plane. Got a pencil? Take this: 
St. Louis — a river warehouse 
with a sign reading 'Bartlett & 
Sons, Jobbers'. Look in the loft. 
And Houston — no, they got 
that one. Baltimore — it's in a 
ship at the docks, the S. S. Gold 
Coast. What other cities? I've 
wasted time feeling around where 
there was nothing to find." 

Reynolds was already shouting 
for Washington to answer. 

Grandma Wilkins was last to 
be relieved; Dorothy located one 
in the Potomac — and Mrs. Wil- 



kins told her sharply to keep try- 
ing. There were four bombs in 
Washington, which Mrs. Wilkins 
had known all along. Dorothy 
found them in eleven minutes. 

Three hours later Reynolds 
showed up in the club messroom, 
not having been able to sleep. 
Several of his people were eating 
and listening to the radio blast 
about our raid on Russia. I [e gave 
it a wide berth; they could blast 
Omsk and Tomsk and Minsk and 
Pinsk; today he didn't care. He 
was sipping milk and thinking 
that he would never drink coffee 
again when Captain Mikeler bent 
over his table. "The General 
wants you. Hurry!" 
"Why?" 

"I said, 'Hurry!' Where's 




161 



Grandma Wilkins — oh — see her. 
Who is Mrs. Dorothy Smith?" 

Reynolds looked around. "She's 
with Mrs. Wilkins." 

Mikelcr rushed them to Han- 
by's office. Hanby merely said, 
"Sit over there. And you ladies, 
(no. Stay in locus." 

Reynolds found himself looking 
into a television screen at the 
President of the United States. 
He looked as weary as Reynolds 
felt, but he turned on his smile. 
"You are Doctor Reynolds?" 

"Yes, Mr. President!" 

"These ladies are Mrs. Wilkins 
and Mrs. Smith?" 

"Yes, sir." 

The President said quietly, 



"You three and your colleagues 
will be thanked by the Republic. 
And by me, for myself. But that 
must wait. Mrs. Smith, there are 
more bombs — in Russia. Could 
your strange gift find them 
there?" 

"Why, I don't — I can try!" 

" Mrs. Wilkins, could you set 
off those Russian bombs while 
they are still far away?" 

Incredibly, she was still bright- 
eyed and chipper. "Why, Mr. 
President ! " 

"Can you? " 

She got .1 far-away look. " Doro- 
thy and I had better have a quiet 
room somewhere. And I'd like a 
pot of tea. A large pot."
