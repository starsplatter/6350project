THE WAY HOME By Theodore Sturgeon

Paul was running away from home. Maybe someday he'd come 
back, covered with glory and a few scars. To a guy who rescues 
fair damsels from alligators, scars are badges of honor. 

Wait a minute. Paul didn't have scars; that was the young 
man who knew about women in Sacramento. Woman who rode 
around in expensive cars and ale chocolate-covered cherries 
. . . or was that some other woman? 

If you've the knack of remembering what it was like to be a 
small boy, how easy it was to get day-dreams and reality mixed 
until you weren't sure where one left off and the other began, 
then Theodore Sturgeon wrote this story especially for you! 



WHEN Paul ran away from 
home, he met no one and 
saw nothing alt the way to the 
highway. The highway swept sud- 
den and wide from the turn by 
Keeper's Rise, past the blunt end 
of the Township Road, and nar- 
rowed off to a distant pinpoint 
pricking at the horizon. After a 
time Paul could see the car. 

It was new and long and it 
threw down its snout a little as 
the driver braked, and when it 
stopped beside him it seesawed 
easily, once, on its big soft 
springs. 

The driver was a large man, 
large and costly, with a grey 
Stetson and a dove-colored top- 
coat made of something that did 
not crease in the bend of his arms 
but rolled and folded instead. The 
wnni.m beside him had ,1 broad 
brow and a pointed chin. Her skin 
had peach shadings, but was 
deeply tanned, and her hair was 



the red gold called "straw color" 
by a smith as he watches hTs 
forge. She smiled at the man and 
she smiled at Paul almost the 
same way. 

" Hi, son," the man said. " This 
the old Township Road?" 

"Yes sir," said Paul, "it sure 
is." 

" Figured it was," said the man. 
"A feller don't forget." 

" Reckon you don't," said Paul. 

"Haven't seen the old town in 
twenty years," said the man. "1 
guess it ain't changed much." 

"These old places don't change 
much/' said Paul with scorn. 

"Oh, they ain't so bad to come 
back to," said the man. "Hate to 
get chained down in one all my 
life, though." 

"Me too," agreed Paul. "You 
from around here?"" 

"Why sure," said the man. 
"My name's Roudenbush. Any 
more Roudenbushes around 



63 



here that you know of, boy?" 

"Place is full of 'em," said 
Paul. " Hey ! You're not the 
Roudenbush kid that ran away 
twenty years ago?" 

"The very one," said the man. 
"What happened after J left?" 

"Why, they talk about you to 
this day," said Paul. "Your 
mother sickened and died, and 
your pa got up in meetin' a month 
after you left an' asked forgiveness 
for treatin' you so mean." 

"Poor old feller," said the man. 
"I guess it was a little rough of 
me to run out like that. But he 
afiked for it." 

"I bet he did." 

"This is my wife," said the 
man. 

The woman smiled at Paul 
again. She did not speak. Paul 
could not think up what kind of a 
voice she might have. She leaned 
forward and opened up the glove 
compartment. It was cram full of 
chocolate-covered cherries. 

"Been crazy about these ever 
since I was a kid," said the man. 
"Help yourself. I got ten pounds 
of them in the back." He leaned 
into the leather cushions, took 
out a silver cigar case, put a cigar 
between his teeth, and applied a 
lighter that flamed up like a little 
bonfire in his hand. "Yes, sir," 
said the man. "J got two more 
cars back in the city, and a 
tuxedo suit with shiny lapels. 1 
made my killing in the stock mar- 
ket, and now I'm president of a 



railroad. I'll be getting back there 
I his evening, after 1 give the folks 
in the old town a treat." 

Paul had a handful of choco- 
late-covered cherries. "Gee," he 
said . After that he walked on 
down the highway. The cherries 
disappeared and the man and the 
lady and the car all disappeared, 
but that didn't matter. "It'll be 
like that," said young Paul Rou- 
denbush. " It'll be just like thai." 
Then, " I wonder what that lady's 
name'll be." 

A quarter of a mile down the 
pike was the turnoff to the 
school, and there was the railroad 
crossing with its big X on a pole 
which he alwa vs read R A 1 L 
CROSSING ROAD. The fore- 
noon freight was bowling down 
the grade, screaming two longa, a 
short, and a long. When he was a 
kid, two years or so back, Paul 
used to think it saluted him: Paul 
. . . Roud , . , n'Bush-h-h . . . with 
the final sibilant made visible in 
the plume of steam on the en- 
gine's iron shoulder. Paul trotted 
up to the crossing and stood just

boose. Caboose with a red flag 
fl>'' n f?> a °d a glimpse at _the 
window of a bull-necked trainman 
shaving, suds on his jowls like a 
mad dog. Then the train was a 
dwindling rectangle on the track, 
and on its top was the silhouette 
of a brakeman, leaning easily into 
wind and velocity, walking on 
top of the boxcars. 

With the train in one ear and 
dust in the other, Paul faced the 
highway. A man stood at the 
<p)ther side of the tracks. Paul 
gaped at him. 

He was wearing an old brown 
jacket with a grey sheepskin col- 
lar, and blue dungarees. These he 
was dusting off with long weather- 
beaten hands, one of which — the 
right — looked like a claw. There 
was no ring-finger or little finger, 
and a third of the palm's breadth 
was gone. From the side of the 
middle finger to the side ot the 
wrist, the hand was neatly sealed 



with a type of flexible silvery 
scar- tissue. 

He looked up from his dusting 
at Paul. " Hi, bub." Either he had 
a beard or he badly needed a 
shave. Paul could see the cleft in 
his square chin, though. The man 
had eyes as pale as the color of 
water poured into a glass after the 
milk had been drunk. 

Paul said *'Hi," still looking at 
the hand. The man asked him 
what that town was over there in 
the hollow, and Paul told him. He 
knew now what the man was — 
one of those fabulous characters 
who rides on freight trains from 
place to place. Rides the rods. 
Catch a fast freight out of Casey, 
which was K.C., which was Kan- 
sas City. They had been every- 
where and done everything, these 
men, and they had a language all 
their own. Handouts and line 
bulls, Chi and mulligan and grab 
a rattler to Nollins. 

The man squinched up his eyes

at the town, as if he were trying to 
drive his gaze through the hill and 
see more. "The old place hasn't 
growed none," he said, and spat. 

Paul spat too. "Never will," he 
said. 

"You from there?" 
*t Yupi" 

"Me loo," said the man sur- 
prisingly. 

"Gosh," said Paul. "You don't 
look like you came from around 
here." 

The man crossed the single 
track to Paul's side. "I guess I 
don't. I been a lot of places since I 
left here." 

"Where you been? " asked Paul. 

The man looked into Paul's 
open eyes, and through them to 
Paul's open credulousness. "AH 
over the world," he said. "All over 
this country on freights, and all 
over the oceans on ships." He 
bared his right forearm. "Look 
there." And sure enough he had a 
tattoo. 

"Women," said the man, flexing 
his claw so that the tattoo writhed. 
"That's what I like." He closed 
one pale eye, pushed his mouth 
sidewise under it, and clucked a 
rapid chick-chick from his pale 
cheek. 

Paul wet his lips, spat again, 
and said, "Yen. Oh boy." 

The man laughed. He had bad 
teeth. "You're like I was. Wasn't 
room enough in that town for 
me'' 

"Mc cither," said Paul. "I 



ain't- going back there no more." 

"Oh, you'll go back. You'll 
want to look it over, and ask a 
few questions around, and find out 
what happened to your old gals, 
and see how dead everything is, 
so's you can go away again knowin' 
you done right to leave in the first 
place. . . . This here's my second 
trip back. Seems like every time I 
go through this part o' the world I 
just got to drop by here and let the 
old burg give me a couple laughs. "* 
He turned his attention right 
around and looked outward again. 
" You really are headin' out, bub?" 

" Headin' out," nodded Paul. 
He liked the sound of that. " Headin' 
out." he said again. 

"Where you bound?" 

"The city," Paul said," unless 
1 hit somethin' I like better 'fore 
I get there." 

The man considered him. " Hey. 
Got any money?" 

Paul shook his head cautiously. 
He had two dollars and ninety- 
two cents. The man seemed to 
make some decision ; he shrugged. 
"Well, good luck, bub. More 
places you see, more of a man 
you'll be. Woman told me that 
once, in Sacramento." 

"Th — ohl" said Paul. Ap- 
proaching the grade crossing was 
a maroon coupe. "It's Mr. Sher- 
man!" 

"Who's he? " 

"The sheriff. He'll be out lookin' 
for me!"

"Sheriff! Me for the brush. 
Don't tag me, you little squirt ! Go 
the other way!" and he dived 
down the embankment and dis- 
appeared into the bushes. 

Frightened by the man's sud- 
den harshness, confused by the 
necessity for instant action, Paul 
shuffled for a moment, almost 
dancing, and then ran to the other 
side. Flat on his stomach in a 
growth of fire weed, he stopped 
breathing and peered at the road. 
The coupe slowed, all but stopped. 
Paul closed his eyes in terror. 
Then he heard the grate of gears 
and the rising whine as the car 
pulled over the tracks in second 
gear and moaned on up the high- 
way. 

Paul waited five minutes, his 
fear leaving him exactly as last as 
his sweat dried. Then he emerged 
and hurried along the highway, 
keeping a sharp watch ahead for 
the sheriff's returning car. He saw 
no sign of the man with the claw. 
But then, he hadn't really ex- 
pected to. 

It could be like that, he thought. 
Travel this old world over. Granips 
used to say that men like thai had 
an itching foot. Paul's feet itched 
a little, if he thought about it. 
Hurt a little, too. He could come 
back years from now with a tattoo 
and a mutilated hand. Folks'd 
really take notice. The stories he 
could tell! '*/ run down the bank, 
see, to haul this tomato out o' th' 
drink. She was yellin' her blonde 



head off. No sooner got my hooks on 
her when clomp! a alligator takes 
off part o' me hand, f didn't mind 
none. Not when I carried this babe 
up the bank." lie shut one eye, 
pushed his mouth sideways, and 
clucked. The sound, somehow, re- 
minded him of chocolate-covered 
cherries. . . . 

Another half-mile, and the coun- 
try became more open. He flicked 
his eyes from side to side as he 
trudged. First sign of that maroon 
coupe and he'd have to fade. 
"Sheriff! Me for the brush!" He 
felt good. He could keep ahead of 
the law. Bet your life. Go where 
you want to go, do what you want 
to do, come back for a laugh every 
once in a while. That was better, 
even, than a big car and a tuxedo 
suit. Women. A smooth-faced one 
in the car beside you or chick- 
chick! women all over. Sacramento 
and every place, to tell you what a 
man you are, because of all the 
places you've been. Yup; that was 
it. 

There was a deep drone from 
overhead. Paul looked up and saw 
the plane — one of the private 
planes that based at the airport 
forty miles away. Planes were no 
novelty, but Paul never saw one 
without an expressed wish that 
something would happen — not 
necessarily a crash, though that 
wouldn't be bad, but much rather 
something that would bring the 
plane down for a forced landing, so 



THE WAY HOME 



he could run over and see the 
pilot get out, and maybe talk to 
him or even help hi m fix the 
trouble. "Let me know next time 
you're at the field," the pilot 
would say. . . . 

Paul slowed, stopped, then went 
to the shoulder and sat down with 
his feet in the dry ditch. He 
watched the plane. It dipped a 
wing and circled, went off and 
came lower, made a run over the 
meadow. Paul thought he was go- 
ing to — well, of course he was 
going to land ! 

The wheels touched, kicked up 
a puff of yellow dust that whisked 
out of existence in the prop-wash. 
They touched again and held the 
earth; the tail came down, bounced 
a little, and then the plane was 
carrying its wings instead of being 
carried. The wings were orange 
and the fuselage was blue, and it 
was glossy in the sun. The wings 
wobbled slightly as the plane tax- 
ied over the lumpy meadow, and 
Paul knew that if he held out his 
arms and wobbled them like that 
he would feel it in his shoulders. 

The motor barked, and the pro- 
pellor-blades became invisible as 
the pilot braked one wheel and 
turned the ship in its own length. 
The propellor, in profile, was a 
ghostly band and then a glass disc 
as the plane swung toward Paul. 
It snorted and wobbled across the 
meadow until it was within twenty 
feet of the fence and the ditch. 
Then, with a roar, it swung broad- 



side to him and the sound of the 
motor dwindled to an easy pwap'-- 
tick-tickety-pwapf while the pilot 
did knowledgeable things at the 
controls. Paul could see him in 
there, plain as day, through the 
cabin doors. The plane was beau- 
tiful; standing still it looked as if it 
was going two hundred miles an 
hour. The windshield swept right 
back over the pilot's head. It was 
fine. 

The pilot opened the door and 
vaulted to the ground. "Glory be! 
You'd think they'd have a field 
built in town after all these 
years." 

"They never will," said Paul. 
"Nice job you got there." 

The pilot, pulling off a pair of 
high-cuffed gloves, looked briefly 
at the plane and grinned. He was 
very clean and had wide shoulders 
and practically no hips. He wore 
a good soft leather jacket and 
tight breeches. "Know anybody 
in town, son?" 

"Everybody, I guess." 

"Well, now. I can get all the 
news from you before I go on in." 

"Say — ain't you Paul Rouden- 
bush?" 

Paul froze. He hadn't said that. 
There were sudden icy cramps in 
the backs of his knees. The plane 
vanished. The pilot vanished. Paul 
sat with his feet in the dry ditch 
and slowly turned his head. 

A maroon coupe stood by the 
ditch. Its door was open, and

there, one foot on the running- 
board, was Mr. Sherman. Sheriff? 
Me for the brush! 

Instead, he licked his lips and 
said, "Hi, Mr. Sherman." 

" My," said Mr. Sherman, "you 
give me a turn, you did. Saw you 
sitting there so still, figured you'd 
been hit by a car or some such." 

" I'm all right," said Paul faintly. 
Me rose. Might as well get it over 
with. "I was just . . . thinkin', I 
guess." 

Thinking — and now he was 
caught, and the thoughts raced 
through him like the cars of the 
forenoon freight; thoughts from 
hot places, cold places, far places. 
Stock-market, car, claw claw plane. 
Women, women, cigarette-lighter, 
landing field. Thoughts that were 
real, thoughts that he made up; 
they barrelled on through him, 
with a roar and a swirl, and left 
him standing, facing the highway, 
and Mr. Sherman, who had caught 
him. 

"Thinking, eh? Well, I'm right 
relieved," said Mr. Sherman. He 
got back in the car, slammed the 
door, stepped on the starter. 

" Mr. Sherman — ain't you — " 

"Ain't I what, son?" 

"Notliin', Mr. Sherman. Nothin' 
at all." 

"You're a weird one," said Mr. 
Sherman, shaking his head. "Hey, 
I 'm heading back into town. Want 
a lift? It's near eating time." 

"No, thanks," said Paul imme- 
diately and with great sincerity. 



Paul watched the maroon coupe 
move off, his mind racing. The car 
was going into town. Without 
him. Mr. Sherihan did not know 
he was running away. Why not? 
Well, they hadn't missed him yet. 
Unless . . . unless they didn't 
care whether he came back or not. 
No. No, that couldn't be! The 
car would go right past his house, 
soon's it got in town. Wasn't much 
of a house. In it, though, was his 
own room. Small, but absolutely 
his own. 

The trouble with the other ways 
to go back, it took time to make a 
killing in the stock-market and 
get married. It took time to ac- 
quire a plane. It probably took 
quite a while to get part of your 
hand cut off. But this way — 

Suddenly he was in the road 
screaming, "Mr. Sherman! Mr. 
Sherman!" 

Mr. Sherman didn't hear him 
but he saw him in the rear-view 
mirror. He stopped and backed up> 
a bit. Paul climbed in, gasped his- 
thanks, and sat still, working on 
his wind. He got it all back just 
about the time they turned into 
the Township Road. 

Mr. Sherman glanced abruptly 
at the boy. "Paul." 

" Yessir." 

" I just had a thought. You, 
way out there on the pike; were 
you running away.' " 

Paul said "No." His eyes were 
more puzzled than anything else. 
" I was coming back," he said.
