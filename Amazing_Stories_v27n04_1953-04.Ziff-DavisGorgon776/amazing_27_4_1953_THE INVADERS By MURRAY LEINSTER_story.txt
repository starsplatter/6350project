THE INVADERS By MURRAY LEINSTER 


ON a certain day — it may be in 
the history books eventually 
— Coburn was in the village of 
Ardea, north of Salonika in the 
most rugged part of Greece. He 
was making a survey for purposes 
which later on turned out not to 



matter much. The village of Ardea 
was small, it was very early in the 
morning, and he was trying to get 
his car started when he heard the 
yell. 

It was a shrill yell, and it trav- 
eled fast. Coburn jerked his head 



THE INVADERS 



107 



Upright from the hood of the car. 
A whiskered villager with flapping 
trousers came pounding up the 
single street. His eyes were panic- 
stricken and his mouth was wide. 
He emitted the yell in a long, sus- 
tained note. Other villagers 
popped into view like ants from a 
disturbed ant-hilL Some instantly 
ran back into their houses. Others 
began to run toward the outskirts 
of the village, toward the south. 

Coburn, watching blankly, 
found himself astonished at the 
number of people the village con- 
tained. He hadn't dreamed it was 
so populous. All were in instant 
frenzied flight toward the moun- 
tains. An old woman he'd seen 
barely hobbling, now ran like a 
deer. Children toddled desper- 
ately. Adults snatched them up 
and ran. Larger children fled on 
twinkling legs. The inhabitants of 
Ardea vanished toward the hills in 
a straggling, racing, panting 
stream. They disappeared around 
an outcrop of stone which was 
merely the nearest place that 
would hide them. Then there was 
silence. 

Coburn turned his head blankly 
in the direction from which they 
had run. He saw the mountains — 
incredibly stony and barren. That 
was all. No, not quite — there 
was something far away which 
was subtly different in color from 
the hillsides. It moved. It flowed 
over a hill crest, coming plainly 
from somewhere beyond the moun- 



tains. It was vague in shape. Co- 
burn felt a momentary stirring of 
superstition. There simply couldn't 
be anything so huge. . . . 

But there could. There was. It 
was a column of soldiers in uni- 
forms that looked dark-gray at 
this distance. It flowed slowly out 
of the mountains like a colossal 
snake — some Midgard monster 
or river of destruction. It moved 
with an awful, deliberate steadi- 
ness toward the village of Ardca. 

Coburn caught his breath. Then 
he was running too. He was out of 
the village almost before he real- 
ized it. He did not try to follow 
the villagers. He might lead pur- 
suers after them. There was a 
narrow defile nearby. Tanks could 
hardly follow it, and it did not 
lead where they would be going. 
He plunged into it and was in- 
stantly hidden. He pelted on. It 
was a trail from somewhere, be- 
cause he saw ancient donkey- 
droppings on the stones, but he 
did not know where it led. He 
simply ran to get away from the 
village and the soldiers who were 
coming toward it. 

This was Greece. They were 
Bulgarian soldiers. This was not 
war or even invasion. This was 
worse — a cold-war raid. He kept 
running and presently rocky clifts 
overhung him on one side, a vast 
expanse of sky loomed to his left. 
He found himself panting. He 
began to hope that he was actu- 
ally safe.

Then he heard a voice. It 
sounded vexed. Quite incredibly, 
it was talking English. "But my 
dear young lady ! " it said severely. 
"You simply mustn't go on! 
There's the very devil of a mess 
turning up, and you mustn't run 
into it!" 

A girl's voice answered, also in 
English. "I'm sure — I don't 
know what you're talking about! " 

"I'm afraid I can't explain. 
But, truly, you mustn't go on to 
the village!" 

Coburn pushed ahead. He came 
upon the people who had spoken. 
There was a girl riding on a don- 
key. She was American. Trim. 
Neat. Uneasy, but reasonably 
self-confident. And there was a 
man standing by the trail, with a 
slide of earth behind him and mud 
on his boots as if he'd slid down 
somewhere very fast to intercept 
l his girl. He wore the distinctive 
costume a Brilish correspondent 
is apt to affect in the wilds. 

They turned as Coburn came 
into view. The girl goggled at 
him. He was not exactly the sort 
of third person one expected to 
find on a very lonely, ill-defined 
rocky trail many miles north of 
Salonika. 

When they turned to him, Co- 
burn recognized the man. He'd 
met Dillon once or twice in Salon- 
ika. He panted: "Dillon! There's 
a column of soldiers headed across 
the border! Bulgarians!" 

"How close? " asked Dillon. 



"They're coming," said Co- 
burn, with some difficulty due to 
lack of breath. " I saw them across 
the valley. Everybody's run away 
from the village. I was the last 
one out." 

Dillon nodded composedly. He 
looked intently at Coburn. "You 
know me," he said reservedly. 
"Should I remember you?" 

"I've met you once or twice," 
Coburn told htm. "In Salonika." 

"Oh," said Dillon. "Oh, yes. 
Sorry. I've got some cameras up 
yonder. I want a picture or two of 
those Bulgarians. See if you can 
persuade this young lady not to 
go on. I fancy it's safe enough 
here. Not a normal raid route 
through this pass." 

Coburn nodded. Dillon expected 
the raid, evidently. This sort of 
thing had happened in Turkey. 
Now it would start up here, in 
Greece. The soldiers would strike 
fast and far, at first. They 
wouldn't stop to hunt down the 
local inhabitants. Not yet. 

1 ' We'll wai t , ' ' said Coburn. 
" You'll be back? " 

"Oh, surely!" said Dillon. "Five 
minutes or less." 

He started up the precipitous 
wall, at whose bottom he had slid 
down. He climbed remarkably 
well. He went up hand-over-hand 
despite the steepness of the stone. 
It looked almost impossible, but 
Dillon apparently found hand- 
grips by instinct, as a good 
climber does. In a matter of min-

utes he vanished, some fifty feet 
up, behind a bulging mass of 
stone. He did not reappear. 

Coburn began to get his breath 
back. The girl looked at him, her 
forehead creased. 

"Just to make sure," said Co- 
burn, "I'll see if I can get a view 
back down the trail." 

Where the vastness of the sky 
showed, he might be able to look 
down. He scrambled up a barrier 
two man-heights high. There was 
a screen of straggly brush, with 
emptiness beyond. He peered. 

He could see a long way down 
and behind, and actually the vil- 
lage was clearly in sight from here. 



There were rumbling, caterpillar- 
tread tanks in the act of entering 
it. There were anachronistic 
mounted men with them. Cavalry 
is outdated, nowadays, but in 
rocky mountain country they can 
have uses where tanks can't go. 
But here tanks and cavalry looked 
grim. Coburn squirmed back and 
beckoned to the girl. She joined 
him. They peered through the 
brushwood together. 

The light tanks were scurrying 
along the single village street. 
Horsemen raced here and there. A 
pig squealed. There was a shot. 
The tanks emerged from the other 
side. They went crawling swiftly 
toward the south. But they did 



110 



 



not turn aside where the villagers 
had. They headed along the way 
Coburn had driven to Ardea. 

Infantrymen appeared, march- 
ing into the village. An advance 
party, rifles ready. This was strict 
discipline and standard military 
practise. Horsemen rode to tell 
them that all was quiet. They 
turned and spurred away after 
the tanks. 

The girl said in a strained voice. 
"This is war starting! Invasion!" 

Coburn said coldly, "No. No 
planes. This isn't war. It's a train- 
ing exercise, Iron-Curtain style. 
This outfit will strike twenty — 
maybe thirty miles south. There's 
a town there — Kilkis. They'll 



take it and loot it. By the time 
Athens finds out what's happened, 
they'll be ready to fall back. 
They'll do a little fighting. They'll 
carry off the people. And they'll 
deny everything. The West doesn't 
want war. Greece couldn't fight 
by herself. And America wouldn't 
believe that such things could 
happen. But they do. It's what's 
called cold war. Ever hear of 
that?" 

The main column of soldiers far 
below poured up to the village 
and went down the straggly street 
in a tide of dark figures. The vil- 
lage was very small. The soldiers 
came out of the other end of the 
village. They poured on after the

tanks, rippling over irregularities 
in the way. They seemed innumer- 
able. 

"Three or four thousand men," 
said Coburn coldly. "This is a big 
raid. But it's not war. Not yet." 

It was not the time for full-scale 
war. Bulgaria and the other coun- 
tries in its satellite status were 
under orders to put a strain upon 
the outside world. They were 
building up border incidents and 
turmoil for the benefit of their 
masters. Turkey was on a war 
footing, after a number of inci- 
dents like this. Indo-China was at 
war. Korea was an old story. Now 
Greece. It always takes more men 
to guard against criminal actions 
than to commit them. When this 
raid was over Greece would have 
to maintain a full-size army in its 
northern mountains to guard 
against its repetition. Which would 
be a strain on its treasury and 
might help toward bankruptcy. 
This was cold war. 

The infantry ended. Horse- 
drawn vehicles appeared in a 
seemingly endless line. Motorized 
transport would be better, but 
the Bulgarians were short of it. 
Shaggy, stubby animals plodded 
in the wake of the tanks and the 
infantry. There were two-wheeled 
carts in single file all across the 
valley. They went through the 
village and filed after the soldiers. 

"I think," said Coburn in bit- 
ing anger, "this will be all there 
is to see. They'll go in until they're 



stopped. They'll kidnap Greek 
civilians and later work them to 
death in labor camps. They'll 
carry off some children to raise as 
spies. But their purpose is prob- 
ably only to make such a threat 
that the Greeks will go broke 
guarding against them. They 
know the Greeks don't want war." 

He began to wriggle back from 
the brushwood screen . He was 
filled with the sort of sick rage 
that comes when you can't ac- 
tively resent insolence and arro- 
gance. He hated the people who 
wanted the world to collapse, and 
this was part of their effort to 
bring it about. 

He helped the girl down. "Dil- 
lon said to wait," he said. He 
found himself shaking with anger 
at the men who had ordered the 
troops to march. "He said he was 
taking pictures. He must have had 
an advance tip of some sort. If 
so, he'll have a line of retreat." 

Then Coburn frowned. Not 
quite plausible, come to think of 
it. But Dillon had certainly known 
about the raid. He was set to take 
pictures, and he hadn't been sur- 
prised. One would have expected 
Greek Army photographers on 
hand to take pictures of a raid of 
which they had warning. Probably 
United Nations observers on the 
scene, too. Yes. There should be 
Army men and probably a United 
Nations team up where Dillon 
was. 

Coburn explained to the girl.

AMAZING stories 



"That'll be it. And they'll have a 
radio, too. Probably helicopters 
taking them out also. I'll go up 
and tell them to be sure and have 
room for you." 

He started for the cliff he'd 
seen Dillon cli mb. He paused : 
"I'd better have your name for 
them to report to Athens." 

"I'm Janice Ames," she told 
him. "The Breen Foundation has 
me going around arranging for 
lessons for the people up here. 
Sanitation and nutrition and mid- 
wifery, and so on. The Founda- 
tion office is in Salonika, though." 

He nodded and attacked the 
cliff, 

It hadn't been a difficult climb 
for Dillon. It wasn't even a long 
one for Coburn, but it was much 
worse than he'd thought. The 
crevices for handholds were rare, 
and footholds were almost non- 
existent. There were times when 
he felt he was holding on by his 
fingernails. Dillon seemed to 
have made it with perfect ease, 
but Coburn found it exhausting. 

Fifty feet up he came to the 
place where Dillon had vanished. 
But it was a preposterously diffi- 
cult task to get across an undercut 
to where he could grasp a stunted 
tree. It was a strain to scramble 
up past it. Then he found himself 
on the narrowest of possible ledges, 
with a sickening drop off to one 
side. But Dillon had made it, so 
he followed. 



He went a hundred yards, and 
then the ledge came to an end. He 
saw where Dillon must have 
climbed. It was possible, but Co- 
burn violently did not want to try. 
Still ... He started. 

Then something clicked in his 
throat. There was a rather deep 
ledge for a space of four or five 
feet. And there was Dillon. No, 
not Dillon. Just Dillon's clothes. 
They lay flat and deflated, but 
laid out in one assembly beside a 
starveling twisted bush. It would 
have been possible for a man to 
stand there to take off his clothes, 
if he wanted to. But a man who 
takes off his clothes — and why 
should Dillon do that? — takes 
them off one by one. These gar- 
ments were fitted together. The 
coat was over the shirt, and the 
trousers fitted to the bottom of 
the shirt over the coat, and the 
boots were at the ends of the 
trouser legs. 

Then Coburn saw something he 
did not believe. It palpably was 
not true. He saw a hand sticking 
out of the end of the sleeve. But 
it was not a hand, because it had 
collapsed. It was rather like an 
unusually thick glove, flesh color. 

Then he saw what should have 
been Dillon's head. And it was in 
place, too. But it was not Dillon's 
head. It was not a head at all. It 
was something quite different. 
There were no eyes. Merely holes. 
Openings. Like a mask. 

Coburn felt a sort of roaring in 



THE INVADERS 



113 



his ears, and he could not think 
clearly for a moment because of 
the shrieking impossibility of 
what he was looking at. Dillon's 
necktie had been very neatly un- 
tied, and left in place in his collar. 
His shirt had been precisely un- 
buttoned. He had plainly done it 
himself. And then — the unbut- 
toned shirt made it clear — he 
had come out of his body. Physi- 
cally, he had emerged and gone 
on. The thing lying flat that had 
lapsed at Cobum's feet was Dil- 
lon's outside. His outside only. 
The inside had come out and gone 
away. It had climbed the cliff 
over Coburn's head. 

The outside of Dillon looked 
remarkably like something made 
out of foam-rubber. Cob urn 
touched it, insanely. 

He heard his own voice saying 
flatly: "It's a sort of suit. A suit 
that looks like Dillon. He was in 
it. Something was! Something is 
playing the part of Dillon. Maybe 
it always was. Maybe there isn't 
any Dillon." 

He felt a sort of hysterical com- 
posure. He opened the chest. It 
was patently artificial. There were 
such details on the inside as would 
be imagined in a container needed 
to fit something snugly. At the 
edges of the opening there were 
fastenings like the teeth of a zip- 
per, but somehow different. Co- 
burn knew that when this was 
fastened there would be no visi- 
ble seam. 



Whatever wore this suit-that- 
looked-like-Dillon could feel per- 
fectly confident of passing for Dil- 
lon, clothed or otherwise. It could 
pass without any question for — 

Coburn gagged. 

// could pass without question for 
a human being. 

Obviously, whatever was wear- 
ing this foam-rubber replica of 
Dillon was not human! 

Coburn went back to where he 
had to climb down the cliffside 
again. He moved like a sleep- 
walker. He descended the fifty- 
foot cliff by the crevices and the 
single protruding rock-point that 
had helped him get up. It was 
much easier going down. In his 
slate of mind it was also more 
dangerous. He moved in a sort of 
robot-like composure. 

He moved toward the girl, 
trying to make words come out 
of his throat, when a small rock 
came clattering down the cliff. 
He looked up. Dillon was in the 
act of swinging to the first part of 
the descent. He came down, very 
confident and assured. He had 
two camera-cases slung from his 
shoulders. Coburn stared at him, 
utterly unable to believe what 
he'd seen ten minutes before. 

Dillon reached solid ground and 
turned. He smiled wryly. His 
shirt was buttoned. His tie was 
tied. 

"I hoped," he said ruefully to 
Janice Ames, "that the Bulgars 
would toddle off. But they left a 



114 



 



guard in the village. We can't 
hope to take an easier trail. We'll 
have to go back the way you 
came. We'll get you safe to Sa- 
lonika, though." 

The girl smiled, uneasily but 
gratefully. 

' 1 And," added Dillon , 1 ' we'd 
better get started." 

He gallantly helped the girl 
remount her donkey. At the sight, 
Coburn was shaken out of his 
numbness. He moved fiercely to 
intervene. But Janice settled her- 
self in the saddle and Dillon con- 
fidently led the way. Coburn 
grimly walked beside her as she 
rode. He was convinced that he 
wouldn't leave her side while Dil- 
lon was around. But even as he 
knew that desperate certitude, he 
was filled with confusion and a 
panicky uncertainty. 

When they'd traveled about 
half a mile, another frightening 
thought occurred to Coburn. Per- 
haps Dillon — passing for human 
— wasn't alone. Perhaps there 
were thousands like him. 

Invaders! Usurpers, pretending 
to be men. Invaders, obviously, 
from space! 

II 

They made eight miles. At least 
one mile of that, added together, 
was climbing straight up. Another 
mile was straight down. The rest 
was boulder-strewn, twisting, don- 
key-wide, slanting, slippery stone. 



But there was no sign of anyone 
but themselves. The sky remained 
undisturbed. No planes. They saw 
no sign of the raiding force from 
across the border, and they heard 
no gunfire. 

Coburn struggled against the 
stark impossibility of what he had 
seen. The most horrifying concept 
regarding invasion from space is 
that of creatures who are able to 
destroy or subjugate humanity. 
A part of that concept was in Co- 
burn's mind now. Dillon marched 
on ahead, in every way convinc- 
ingly human. But he wasn't. 
And to Coburn, his presence as a 
non-human invader of Earth 
made the border-crossing by the 
Bulgarians seem almost benevo- 
lent. 

They went on. The next hill was 
long and steep. Then they were at 
the hill crest. They looked down 
into a village called Naousa. It 
was larger than Ardea, but not 
much larger. One of the houses 
burned un tended. Figures moved 
about. There were tanks in sight, 
and many soldiers in the uniform 
that looked dark-gray at a dis- 
tance. The route by which Dillon 
had traveled had plainly curved 
into the line-of-march of the Bul- 
garian raiding force. 

But the moving figures were not 
soldiers. The soldiers were still. 
They lay down on the grass in 
irregular, sprawling windrows. 
The tanks were not in motion. 
There were two-wheeled carts in 



THE INVADERS

sight — reaching back along the 
invasion-route — and they were 
just as stationary as the men and 
the tanks. The horses had toppled 
in their shafts. They were mo- 
tionless. 

The movement was of civilians 
— men and women alike. They 
were Greek villagers, and they 
moved freely among the unmili- 
tarily recumbent troops, and even 
from this distance their occupa- 
tion was clear. They were happily 
picking the soldiers' pockets. But 
there was one figure which moved 
from one prone figure to another 
much too quickly to be looting. 
Coburn saw sunlight glitter on 
something in his hand. 

Dillon noticed the same thing 
Coburn did at the same instant. 
He bounded forward. He ran to- 
ward the village and its tumbled 
soldiers in great, impossible leaps. 
No man could make such leaps or 
travel so fast. He seemed almost 
to soar toward the village, shout- 
ing. Coburn and Janice saw him 
reach the village. They saw him 
rush toward the one man who had 
been going swiftly from one prone 
soldier to another. It was too far 
to see Dillon's action, but the sun- 
light glittered again on something 
bright, which this time flew 
through the air and dropped to 
the ground. 

The villagers grouped about 
Dillon. There was no sign of a 
struggle. 



"What's happened?" demanded 
Janice uneasily. "Those are sol- 
diers on the ground." 

Coburn's fright prevented his 
caution. He shouted furiously. 
"He's not a man! You saw it! 
No man can run so fast! You saw 
those jumps! He's not human! 
He's — something else!" 

Janice jerked her eyes to Co- 
burn in panic. "What did you 
say?" 

Coburn panted: "Dillon's no 
man ! He's a monster from some- 
where in space! And he and his 
kind have killed those soldiers! 
Murdered them! And the soldiers 
are men! You stay here. I'll go 
down there and — " 

"No!" said Janice, "I'm com- 
ing too." 

He took the donkey's halter 
and led the animal down to the 
village, with Janice trembling a 
little in the saddle. He talked in a 
tight, taut, hysterical tone. He 
told what he'd found up on the 
cliffside. He described in detail 
the similitude of a man's body 
he'd found deflated beside a 
stunted bush. 

He did not look at Janice as he 
talked. He moved doggedly to- 
ward the village, dragging at the 
donkey's head. They neared the 
houses very slowly, and Coburn 
considered that he walked into the 
probability of a group of other 
creatures from unthinkable other 
star systems, disguised as men. 
It did not occur to him that his 



116 



 



sudden outburst about Dillon 
sounded desperately insane to 
Janice. 

They reached, the first of the 
fallen soldiers. Janice looked, 
shuddering. Then she said thinly: 
"He's breathing!" 

He was. He was merely a boy. 
Twenty or thereabouts. He lay 
on his back, his eyes closed. His 
face was upturned like a dead 
man's. But his breast rose and fell 
rhythmically. He slept as if he 
were drugged. 

But that was more incredible 
than if he'd been dead. Regiments 
of men fallen simultaneously 
asleep. . . . 

Coburn 's flow of raging speech 
stopped short. He stared. He saw 
other fallen soldiers. Dozens of 
them, fn coma-like slumber, the 
soldiers who had come to loot and 
murder lay like straws upon the 
ground, if they had been dead it 
would have been more believable. 
At least there are ways to kill 
men. But this . , . 

Dillon parted the group of vil- 
lagers about him and came to- 
ward Cob urn and Janice. He was 
frowning in a remarkably human 
fashion. 

"Here's a mess!" he said irri- 
tably. "Those Bulgars came 
marching down out of the pass. 
The cavalry galloped on ahead 
and cut the villagers off so they 
couldn't run away. They started 
to loot the village. They weren't 



pleasant. Women began to scream, 
and there were shootings — all in 
a matter of minutes. And then the 
looters began to act strangely. 
They staggered around and sat 
down and went to sleep!" 

He waved his hands in a help- 
less gesture, but Coburn was not 
deceived. 

"The tanks arrived. And they 
stopped — and their crews went 
to sleep! Then the infantry ap- 
peared, staggering as it marched. 
The officers halted to see what 
was happening ahead, and the 
entire infantry dropped off to 
sleep right where it stood! 

" It's bad! If it bad happened a 
mile or so back . . . The Greeks 
must have played a trick on 
them, but those cavalrymen raised 
the devil in the few minutes they 
were out of hand ! They killed 
some villagers and then keeled 
over. And now the villagers aren't 
pleased. There was one man 
whose son was murdered, and he's 
been slitting the Bulgars' throats!" 

He looked at Coburn, and Co- 
burn said in a grating voice: "I 
see." 

Dillon said distressedly : "One 
can't let them slit the throats of 
sleeping men! I'll have to stay 
here to keep them from going at 
it again. I say, Coburn, will you 
take one of their staff cars and run 
on down somewhere and tell the 
Greek government what's hap- 
pened here? Something should be 
done about it ! Soldiers should

117 



come to keep order and take 
charge of these chaps." 

"Yes," said Coburn. "I'll do it. 
I'll take Janice along, too." 

"Splendid!" Dillon nodded as 
if in relief. "She'd better get out 
of the mess entirely. I fancy 
there' d have been a full-scale 
massacre if we hadn't come along. 
The Greeks have no reason to 
love these chaps, and their inten- 
tions were hardly amiable. But 
one can't let them be murdered!" 

Coburn had his hand on his re- 
volver in his pocket. His finger 
was on the trigger. But if Dillon 
needed him to rim an errand, then 
there obviously were no others of 
his own kind about. 

Dillon turned his back. He gave 
orders in the barbarous dialect of 
the mountains. His voice was 
authoritative. Men obeyed him 
and dragged uniformed figures out 
of a light half-track that was 
plainly a staff car. Dillon beck- 
oned, and Coburn moved toward 
him. The important thing as far 
as Coburn was concerned was to 
get Janice to safety. Then to re- 
port the full event. 

"I ... I'm not sure . . ."be- 
gan Janice, her voice shaking. 

"I'll prove what I said," raged 
Coburn in a low tone. "I'm not 
crazy, though I feel like it!" 

Dillon beckoned again. Janice 
slipped off the donkey's back. 
She looked pitifully frightened 
and irresolute. 



"I've located the chap who's 
the mayor of this village, or some- 
thing like that. Take htm along. 
They might not believe you, but 
they'll have to investigate when 
he turns up." 

A white-bearded villager re- 
luctantly climbed into the back 
of the car. Dillon pleasantly of- 
fered to assist Janice into the 
front seat. She climbed in, deathly 
white, frightened of Coburn and 
almost ashamed to admit that his 
vehement outburst had made her 
afraid of Dillon, too. 

Dillon came around to Coburn's 
side of the vehicle. " Privately," 
he said with a confidential air, 
"I'd advise you to dump this may- 
or person where lie can reach au- 
thority, and then go away quietly 
and say nothing of what hap- 
pened up here. If the Greeks are 
using some contrivance that han- 
dles an affair like this, it will be 
top secret. They won't like civil- 
ians knowing about it." 

Coburn's grip on his revolver 
was savage. It seemed likely, 
now, that Dillon was the only 
one of his extraordinary kind 
about. 

"I think I know why you say 
that," he said harshly. 

Dillon smiled. "Oh, come now!" 
he protested. "I'm quite unoffi- 
cial! " 

He was incredibly convincing 
at that moment. There was a 
wry half-smile on his face. He 
looked absolutely human; abso- 



118 



 



lutely like the British correspond- 
ent Coburn had met in Salonika. 
He was too convincing. Coburn 
knew he would suspect his own 
sanity unless he made sure. 

"You're not only unofficial," 
said Coburn grimly. His hand 
came up over the edge of the 
staff-car door. It had his revolver 
in it. It bore inexorably upon the 
very middle of Dillon's body. 
"You're not human, either! 
You're not a man! Your name 
isn't Dillon! You're — something 
I haven't a word for! But if you 
try anything fancy I'll see if a 
bullet through your middle will 
stop you !" 

Dillon did not move. He said 
easily: "You're being absurd, my 
dear fellow. Put away that pistol." 

"You slipped!" said Coburn 
thickly. "You said the Greeks 
played a trick on this raiding 
party. But you played it. At 
Ardea, when you climbed that 
cliff — no man could climb so 
fast. No man could run as you ran 
down Into this village. And I saw 
that body you're wearing when 
you weren't in it! I followed you 
up the cliff when — " Coburn's 
voice was ragingly sarcastic — 
"when you were taking pictures!" 

Dillon's face went impassive. 
Then he said: "Well?" 

"Will you let me scratch your 
finger?" demanded Coburn al- 
most hysterically. "If it bleeds, 
I'll apologize and freely admit 



I'm crazy ! But if it doesn't . . ." 

The .thing-that-was-not-Dillon 
raised its eyebrows. "It wouldn't," 
it said coolly. "You do know. 
What follows?" 

"You're something from space," 
accused Coburn, "sneaking around 
Earth trying to find out how to 
conquer us! You're an Invader! 
You're trying out weapons. And 
you want me to keep my mouth 
shut so we Earth people won't 
patch up our own quarrels and 
join forces to hunt you down! 
But we'll do it! We'll do it!" 

The thing-that-was-not-Dillon 
said gently: "No. My dear chap, 
no one will believe you." 

" We'll see about that ! " snapped 
Coburn. "Put those cameras in 
the car!" 

The figure that looked so hu- 
man hesitated a long instant, 
then obeyed. It lowered the two 
seeming cameras into the back 
part of the staff car. 

Janice started to say, "I . . . 
I . . ." 

The pseudo-Dillon smiled at 
her. "You think he's insane, and 
naturally you're scared," it said 
reassuringly. " But he's sane. He's 
quite right. I am from outer space. 
And I'm not humoring him either. 
Look!" 

He took a knife from his pocket 
and snapped it open. He deliber- 
ately ran the point down the side 
of one of his fingers. 

The skin parted. Something 
that looked exactly like foam- 



THE INVADERS 



119 



rubber was revealed. There were 
even bubbles in it. 

The pseudo-Dillon said, "You 
see, you don't have to be afraid 
of him. He's sane, and quite hu- 
man. You'll feel much better trav- 
eling with him." Then the figure 
turned to Coburn. "You won't 
believe it, but I really like you, 
Coburn. I like the way you've 
reacted. It's very . . . human." 

Coburn said to him: "It'll be 
human, too, when we start to 
hunt you down!" He let the staff 
car in gear. Dillon smiled at him. 
He let in the clutch, and the car 
leaped ahead. 

In the two camera-cases Coburn 
was sure that he had the cryptic 
device that was responsible for the 
failure of a cold-war raid. He 
wouldn't have dared drive away 
from Dillon leaving these devices 
behind. If they were what he 
thought, they'd be absolute proof 
of the truth of his Story, and they 
should furnish clues to the sort of 
science the Invaders possessed. 
Show the world that Invaders 
were upon it, and all the world 
would combine to defend Earth. 
The cold war would end. 

But a bitter doubt came to him. 
Would they? Or would they offer 
zestfully to be viceroys and over- 
seers for the Invaders, betraying 
the rest of mankind for the privi- 
lege of ruling them even under 
unhuman masters? 

Janice swayed against his shoul- 



der. He cast a swift glance at her. 
Her face was like marble. 

"What's the matter?" 

She shook her head. " I'm trying 
not to faint," she said unsteadily. 
"When you told me be was from 
another world 1 . . . thought you 
were crazy. But when he admitted 
it . . . when he proved it . . ." 

Coburn growled. The trail 
twisted and dived down a steep 
slope. It twisted again and ran 
across a rushing, frothing stream. 
Coburn drove into the rivulet. 
Water reared up in wing-like 
sheets on either side. The staff 
car climbed out, rocking, on the 
farther side. Coburn put it to the 
ascent beyond. The trail turned 
and climbed and descended as the 
stony masses of the hills required. 

" He's — from another world ! " 
repeated Janice. Her teeth chat- 
tered. "What do they want — 
creatures like him? How ■— how 
many of them are there? Anybody 
could be one of them! What do 
they want?" 

"This is a pretty good world," 
said Coburn fiercely. "And his 
kind will want it. We're merely 
the natives, the aborigines, to 
them, Maybe they plan to wipe 
us out, or enslave us. But they 
won't! We can spot them now! 
They don't bleed. Scratch one and 
you find — foam-rubber. X-rays 
will spot them. We'll learn to pick 
them out — and when some spe- 
cialists look over those things that 
look like cameras we'll know more

slill! Enough to do something!" 

"Then you think it's an inva- 
sion from space?" 

"What else?" snapped Coburn. 

II is stomach was a tight 
cramped knot now. He drove the 
car hard! 

In air miles the distance to be 
covered was relatively short. In 
road miles it seemed interminable. 
The road was bad and curving be- 
yond belief. It went many miles 
east and many miles west for 
every mile of southward gain. The 
hour grew late. Coburn had lied 
Ardea at sunrise, but they'd 
reached Naousa after midday and 
he drove frantically over incredi- 
ble mountain roads until dusk. 
Despite sheer recklessness, how- 
ever, he could not average thirty 
miles an hour. There were times 
when even the half-track had to 
crawl or it would overturn. The 
sun set, and he went on up steep 
grades and down steeper ones in 
the twilight. Night fell and the 
headlights glared ahead, and the 
staff-car clanked and clanked and 
grumbled and roared on through 
the darkness. 

They probably passed through 
villages — the headlights showed 
stone hovels once or twice — but 
no lights appeared. It was mid- 
night before they saw a moving 
yellow spot of brightness with a 
glare as of fire upon steam above 
it. There were other small lights 
in a row behind it, and they 



saw that all the tights moved. 

"A ra ilroad ! " said Coburn. 
"We're getting somewhere!" 

It was a railroad train on the 
other side of a valley, but they did 
not reach the track. The highway 
curved away from it. 

At two o'clock in the morning 
they saw electric lights. The high- 
way became suddenly passable. 
Presently they ran into the still, 
silent streets of a slumbering 
town — Serrai — an administra- 
tive center for this part of Greece. 
They threaded its ways while 
Coburn watched for a proper 
place to stop. Once a curiously- 
hatted policeman stared blankly 
at them under an arc lamp as the 
staff car clanked and rumbled past 
him. They saw a great pile of stone 
which was a church. They saw a 
railroad station. 

Not far away there was a build- 
ing in which there were lights. A 
man in uniform came out of its 
door. 

Coburn stopped a block away. 
There were uneasy stirrings, and 
the white-bearded passenger from 
the village said incomprehensible 
things in a feeble voice. Coburn 
got Janice out of the car first. She 
was stiff and dizzy when she tried 
to walk. The Greek was in worse 
condition still. He clung to the 
side of the staff car. 

"We tell the truth," said Co- 
burn curtly, "when we talk to the 
police. We tell the whole truth — 
except about Dillon. That sounds 



THK INVADERS 



121 



too crazy. We tell it to top-level 
officials only, after they realize 
that something they don't know 
anything about has really taken 
place. Talk of Invaders from space 
would either get us locked up as 
lunatics or would create a panic. 
This man will tell what happened 
up there, and they'll investigate. 
But we take these so-called cam- 
eras to Salonika, and get to an 
American battleship." 

He lifted Dillon's two cameras 
by the carrying-straps. And the 
straps pulled free. They'd held the 
cases safely enough during a long 
journey on foot across the moun- 
tains. But they pulled clear now. 

Coburn had a bitter thought. 
He struck a match. He saw the 
leather cases on the floor of the 
staff car. He picked up one of 
them. He took it to the light of 
the headlights, standing there in 
the resonant darkness of a street 
in a city of stone houses. 

The leather was brittle. It was 
friable, as if it had been in a fire. 
Coburn plucked it open, and it 
came apart in his hands. Inside 
there was the smell of scorched 
things. There was a gritty metallic 
powder. Nothing else. The other 
carrying-case was in exactly the 
same condition. 

Coburn muttered bitterly: 
"They were set to destroy them- 
selves if they got into other hands 
than Dillon's. We haven't a bit of 
proof that he wasn't a human 



being. Not a shred of proof!" 

He suddenly felt a sick rage, as 
if he had been played with and 
mocked. The raid from Bulgaria 
was serious enough, of course. It 
would have killed hundreds of 
people and possibly hundreds of 
others would have been enslaved. 
But even that was secondary in 
Coburn's mind. The important 
thing was that there were Invad- 
ers upon Earth. Non-human mon- 
sters, who passed for humans 
through disguise. They had been 
able to travel through space to 
land secretly upon Earth. They 
moved unknown among men, 
learning the secrets of mankind, 
preparing for — what? 

Ill 

They got into Salonika early 
afternoon of the next day, after 
many hours upon an antique rail- 
road train that puffed and grunted 
and groaned among interminable 
mountains. Coburn got a taxi to 
take Janice to the office of the 
Breen Foundation which had sent 
her up to the north of Greece to 
establish its philanthropic in- 
struction courses. He hadn't much 
to say to Janice as they rode. He 
was too disheartened. 

In the cab, though, he saw great 
placards on which newspaper 
headlines appeared in Greek. He 
could make out the gist of them. 
Essentially, they shrieked that 
Bulgarians had invaded Greece 



122 



 



and had been wiped out. He made 
out the phrase for valiant Greek 
army. And the Greek army was 
valiant enough, but it hadn't had 
anything to do with this. 

From the police station in 
Serrai — he had been interviewed 
there until dawn — he knew what 
action had been taken. Army 
planes had Mown northward in 
the darkness, moved by the May- 
or's, and Coburn 's, and Janice's 
tale of Bulgarian soldiers on 
Greek soil, sleeping soundly. They 
had released parachute flares and 
located the village of Naousa. 
Parachutists with field radios had 
jumped, while other flares burned 
to light them to the ground. That 
was that. Judging by the placards, 
their reports had borne out the 
story Coburn had brought down. 
There would be a motorized Greek 
division on the way to take charge 
of the four-thousand-odd uncon- 
scious raiders. There was probably 
an advance guard there now. 

But there was no official news. 
Even the Greek newspapers called 
it rumors. Actually, it was leaked 
information. It would be reason- 
able for the Greek government to 
let it leak, look smug, and blandly 
say "No comment" to all in- 
quiries, including those from Bul- 
garia. 

But behind that appearance of 
complacency, the Greek govern- 
ment would be going quietly mad 
trying to understand what so for- 
tunately had happened. And Co- 



burn could tell them. But he knew 
better than to try without some 
sort of proof. Yet, he had to tell. 
The facts were more important 
than what people thought of him. 

The cab stopped before his own 
office. He paid the driver. The 
driver beamed and said happily: 
" Tys nikisame, e?" 

Coburn said, " Poly kala. Orea." 

His office was empty. It was 
dustier than usual. His secretary 
was probably taking a holiday 
since he was supposed to be out of 
town. He grunted and sat down at 
the telephone. He called a man he 
knew. Hallen — another Ameri- 
can — was attached to a non- 
profit corporation which was at- 
tached to an agency which was 
supposed to cooperate with a 
committee which had something 
to do with NATO. Hallen an- 
swered the phone in person. 

Coburn identified himself. 
' ' Have you heard any ru mors 
about a Bulgarian raid up-coun- 
try? " he asked. 

"I haven't heard anything else 
since I got up," Hallen told him. 

"I was there," said Coburn. "I 
brought the news down. Can you 
come over?" 

"I'm halfway there now!" said 
Hallen as he slammed down the 
phone. 

Coburn paced up and down his 
office. It was very dusty. Even 
the seat of the chair at his secre- 
tary's desk was dusty. The odds 



THE INVADERS 



123 



were that she was coming in only 
to sort the mail, and not even sit- 
ting down for that. He shrugged. 

He heard footsteps. The door 
opened. H is secretary, Helena, 
came in. She looked surprised. 

"I was at lunch," she explained. 
She had a very slight accent. She 
hung up her coat. "I am sorry. I 
stopped at a store." 

He had paused in his pacing to 
nod at her. Now he stared, but 
her back was turned toward him. 
He blinked. She had just told a 
very transparent lie. And Helena 
was normally very truthful. 

"You had a good trip?" she 
asked politely. 

"Fair," said Coburn. "Any 
phone calls this morning ? " he 
asked. 

"Not this morning," she said 
politely. 

She reached in a desk drawer. 
She brought out paper. She put 
it in the typewriter and began to 
type. 

Coburn felt very queer. Then he 
saw something else. There was a 
fly in the office - — a large, green- 
bodied fly of metallic lustre. The 
inhabitants of Salonika said with 
morbid pride that it was a spe- 
cialty of the town, with the most 
painful of all known fly stings. 
And Helena abhorred flies. 

It landed on the bare skin of her 
neck. She did not notice. It stayed 
there. Ordinarily she would have 
jumped up, exclaiming angrily in 
Greek, and then she would have 



pursued the fly vengefully witli a 
folded newspaper until she killed 
it. But now she ignored it. 

Hallen came in, stamping. Co- 
burn closed the door behind him. 
He felt queer at the pit of his 
stomach. For Helena to let a fly 
stay on her neck suggested that 
her skin was . . . somehow not 
like its usual self. 

"What happened to those Bul- 
garians?" demanded Hallen. 

Coburn told him precisely what 
he'd seen when he arrived in 
Naousa after an eight-mile hike 
through mountains. Then he went 
back and told Hallen precisely 
what he'd seen up on the cliff side. 

"His cameras were some sort of 
weapon. He played it on the 
marching column, it took effect 
and they went to sleep," he fin- 
ished. "I took them away from 
him and brought them down, 
but — " 

He told about the contents of 
the camera cases being turned to 
a gritty, sooty powder. Then he 
added: "Dillon set them to de- 
stroy themselves. You under- 
stand. He's not a man. He's a 
creature from some planet other 
than Earth, passing for a human 
being. He's an Invader from 
space." 

Hallen 's expression was uneasy 
and compassionate but utterly 
unbelieving. Helena shivered and 
turned away her face. Coburn's 
lips went taut. He reached down 
to his desk. He made a sudden, 



124 



AMAZIXG STORIES 



abrupt gesture. Hallen caught his 
breath and started up. 

Coburn said curtly: "Another 
one of them. Helena, is that 
foam-suit comfortable?" 

The girl jerked her face around. 
She looked frightened. 

' ' Helena , " said Cobu rn , " the 
real Helena, that is, would not 
sit down on a dusty chair. No 
woman would. But you did. She is 
a very truthful girl. You lied to 
me. And I just stuck pins in your 
shoulder and you didn't notice. 
They're sticking in your foam suit 
now. You and the creature that 
passed for Dillon up-country are 
bot h aliens. I nvaders. Do you 
want to try to convince me other- 
wise?" 

The girl said evenly: "Mr. Co- 
burn, I do not think you are 
well — " 

Then Coburn said thickly: " I'm 
crazy enough to put a bullet 
through you if your gang of devils 
has harmed the real Helena. 
What's happened to her?" 

Hallen moved irresolutely to 
interfere. But the girl's expression 
(hanged. She smiled. "The real 
Helena, Mr. Coburn," said an 
entirely new voice, "has gone to 
the suburbs to visit her fiancee's 
family. She is quite safe." 

There was dead silence. The 
figure — it even moved like Hel- 
ena — got composedly to its feet. 
It got its coat. It put the coat on. 
Hallen stared with his mouth 



open. The pins hadn't convinced 
him, but the utterly different 
voice coming from this girl's 
mouth had. Yet, waves of con- 
flicting disbelief and conviction, 
horror and a racking doubt, 
chased themselves over his fea- 
tures. 

"She admits she's not Helena!" 
said Coburn with loathing. "It's 
not human! Should I shoot it?" 

The girl smiled at him again. 
Her eyes were very bright. "You 
will not, Mr. Coburn. And you 
will not even try to keep me 
prisoner to prove your story. If I 
screamed that you attack me — " 
the smile widened — " Helena's 
good Greek friends would come to 
my assistance." 

She walked confidently to the 
door and opened it. Then she said 
warmly: "You are very intelli- 
gent, Mr. Coburn. We approve of 
you very much. But nobody will 
believe you." 

The office door closed. 

Coburn turned stiffly to the 
man he'd called to hear him. 
"Should I have shot her, Hal- 
len?" 

Hallen sat down as if his knees 
had given way beneath him. 
After a long time he got out a 
handkerchief and painfully mopped 
his face. At the same time he shiv- 
ered. 

"N-no. . . ." Then he swal- 
lowed. "My God, Coburn! It's 
true!" 

"Yes," said Coburn bitterly, 



THE INVADKKS 



125 



"or you're as crazy as I am." 

Hallen's eyes looked haunted. 
**I — I . . ." He swallowed 
again. "There's no question about 
the Bulgarian business. That did 
happen ! And you were there. And 
— there've been other things. 
. . . Rumors. . . . Reports that 
nobody believed. ... I might 
be able to get somebody to listen. 
. . ." He shivered again. "If it's 
true, it's the most terrible thing 
that ever happened. Invaders 
from space. . . . Where do you 
think they came from, Coburn?" 

"The creature that looked like 
Dillon could climb incredibly fast. 
I saw it run and leap. Nothing on 
Earth could run or leap like that." 
Coburn shrugged. " Maybe a planet 
of another sun, with a monstrous 
gravity." 

"Try to get somebody to be- 
lieve that, eh?" Hallen got pain- 
fully to his feet. "I'll see what I 
can do. I . . . don't know that I 
can do anything but get myself 
locked up for observation. But I'll 
call you in an hour." 

He went unsteadily out of the 
door. Coburn instantly called the 
Breen Foundation on the tele- 
phone. He'd left Janice there less 
than an hour before. She came to 
the phone and gasped when she 
heard his voice. Raging, he told 
her of Helena, then cautioned her 
to be especially careful — to be 
suspicious of everybody. 

"Don't take anybody's word!" 
snapped Coburn. "Doubt every- 



body! Doubt me! Unl il you're ab- 
solutely certain. Those creatures 
are everywhere. . . . They may 
pre Lend lo be anybody!" 

After Coburn hung up on 
Janice, he sat back and tried to 
think logically. There had to be 
some way by which an extra- 
terrestrial Invader could be told 
instantly from a human being. 
Unmask and prove even one such 
creature, and the whole story 
would be proved. But how detect 
them? Their skin was perfectly 
deceptive. Scratched, of course, 
they could be caught. But one 
couldn't go around scratching 
people. There was nothing of the 
alien creature's own actual form 
that showed. 

Then Coburn remembered the 
Dillon foam suit. The head had 
been hollow. Flaccid. Holes in- 
stead of eyes. The creature's own 
eyes showed through. 

But he'd have to make certain. 
He'd have to look at a foam-suited 
creature. He could have examined 
Helena's eyes, but she was gone 
now. However, there was an al- 
ternative. There was a Dillon in 
Salonika, as there was a Helena. 
If the Dillon in Salonika was the 
real Dillon — if there were a real 
Dillon — he could look at his 
eyes. He could tell if he were the 
false Dillon or the real one. 

At this hour of the afternoon a 
Britisher would consider tea a 
necessity. There was only one 



1 26 



 



place in Salonika where they 
served tea that an Englishman- 
would consider drinkable. Coburn 
got into a cab and gave the driver 
the address, and made sure of the 
revolver in his pocket. He was 
frightened. He was either going to 
meet with a monster from outer 
space, or be on the way to making 
so colossal a fool of himself that a 
mental asylum would yawn for 
him. 

He went into the one coffee- 
shop in Salonika which served 
drinkable tea. It was dark and 
dingy inside, though the table- 
clothes were spotless. He went in, 
and there was Dillon. 

Coburn's flesh crawled. If the 
figure sitting there with the Lon- 
don Times and a cup of tea before 
him were actually a monster from 
another planet . . . 

But Dillon read comfortably, 
and sipped his tea. Coburn ap- 
proached, and the Englishman 
looked up inquiringly. 

"I was ... up in the moun- 
tains," said Coburn feverishly, 
"when those Bulgarians came 
over. I can give you the story." 

Dillon said frostily: "I'm not 
interested. The government's of- 
ficially denied that any such inci- 
dent took place. It's merely a 
silly rumor." 

It was reasonable that it should 
be denied. But it had happened, 
nonetheless. Coburn stared, de- 
spite a consciousness that he was 
not conspicuously rational in the 



way his eyes searched Dillon's 
face hungrily. The eyes were dif- 
ferent! The eyes of the Dillon up 
in the mountains had been larger, 
and the brown part — But he had 
to be sure. 

Suddenly, Coburn found him- 
self grinning. There was a simple, 
a perfect, an absolute test for 
humanity! 

Dillon said suspiciously: "What 
the devil are you staring at me 
for?" 

Coburn continued to grin un- 
controllably, even as he said in a 
tone of apology: " I hate to do this, 
but I have to be sure. . . ." 

He swung. He connected with 
Dillon's nose. Blood started. 

Coburn zestfully let himself 
be thrown out, while Dillon 
roared and tried to get at him 
through the flying wedge of wait- 
ers. He felt an enormous relaxa- 
tion on the way back to his office 
in another cab. He was a trifle 
battered, but it was worth it. 

Back in the office he called 
Hallen again. And again Hallen 
answered. He sounded guilty and 
worried. 

" I don't know whether I'm 
crazy or not," he said bitterly. 
"But I was in your office. I saw 
your secretary there — and she 
didn't feel pins stuck in her. And 
something did happen to those 
Bulgarians that the Greeks don't 
know anything about, or the 
Americans either. So you're to tell 



THE INVADKKS 



127 



your story to the high brass down 
in Athens. I think you'll be locked 
up afterward as a lunatic — and 
me with you for believing my own 
eyes. But a plane's being readied." 

"Where do I meet you?" asked 
Coburn. 

Hallen told him. A certain room 
out at the airport. Coburn hung 
up. The telephone rang instantly. 
He was on the way out, but he 
turned back and answered it, 
Janice's voice — amazingly con- 
vincing — came from the instru- 
ment. And at the first words his 
throat went d ry. Because it 
couldn't be Janice. 

"I've been trying to get you. 
Have you tried to reach me?" 

"Why, no. Why?" 

Janice's voice said : " I've some- 
thing interesting to tell you. I 
left the office an hour ago. I'm at 
the place where I live when I'm in 
Salonika. Write down the address. 
Can you come here? I've found out 
something astonishing!" 

He wrote down the address. He 
had a feeling of nightmarishness. 
This was not Janice — • 

"I'm clearing up some matters 
you'll guess at," he said grimly, 
"so I may be a little while getting 
there. You'll wait?" 

He hung up. And then with a 
rather ghastly humor he took 
some pins from a box on the desk 
and worked absorbedly at bending 
one around the inside of the band 
of the seal ring he wore on his 
right hand. 



But he didn't go to the tele- 
phoned address. He went to the 
Breen Foundation. And Janice 
was there. She was the real Janice. 
He knew it instantly he saw her. 
She was panic-stricken when he 
told her of his own telephone ex- 
perience. Her teeth chattered. But 
she knew — instinctively, she said 
— that he was himself. She got 
into the cab with him. 

They reached the airport and 
found the office Hallen had 
named. The lettering on it, in 
Greek and French, said that it 
was a reception room for official 
visitors only. 

"Our status is uncertain," said 
Coburn drily. "We may be official 
guests, or we may be crazy. It's a 
toss-up which status sticks." 

He opened the door and looked 
carefully inside before he entered. 
Hallen was there. There was a 
lean, hard-bitten colonel of the 
American liaison force in Greece. 
There was a Greek general, pudgy 
and genial, standing with his back 
to a window and his hands clasped 
behind him. There were two 
Greek colonels and a major. They 
regarded him soberly. 

"Howdo, Coburn," said Hallen 
painfully. "You're heading for 
Athens, you know. This is Miss 
Ames? But these gentlemen have 
... ah ... a special concern 
with that business up-country. 
They'd like to hear your story 
before you leave." 

" I suppose," said Coburn 



128 



AMAZING STORIKS 



curtly, "it's a sort of preliminary 
commission in lunacy." 

But he shook hands all around. 
He kept his left hand in his coat 
pocket as he shook hands with his 
right. His revolver was in his left- 
hand pocket now too. The Greek 
general beamed at him. The 
American colonel's eyes were hard 
and suspicious. One of the two 
Greek colonels was very slightly 
cross-eyed. The Greek major 
shook hands solemnly. 

Coburn took a deep breath. "I 
know my tale sounds crazy," he 
said, "but ... I had a telephone 
call just now. Hallen will bear me 
out that my secretary was imper- 
sonated by somebody else this 
afternoon." 

"I've told them that," said 
Hallen unhappily. 

"And something was imper- 
sonating Dillon up in the hills," 
finished Coburn. "I've reason to 
believe that at this address" — 
and he handed the address he'd 
written down to Hallen — "a 
. . . creature will be found who 
will look most convincingly like 
Miss Ames, here. You might send 
and see." 

The American colonel snorted: 
"This whole tale's preposterous! 
It's an attempt to cash in on the 
actual mystery of what happened 
up-country." 

The Greek general protested 
gently. His English was so heavily 
accented as to be hard to under- 
stand, but he pointed out that 



Coburn knew details of the event 
in Naousa that only someone who 
had been there could know. 

"True enough," said the Ameri- 
can officer darkly, "but he can 
tell the truth now, before we make 
fools of ourselves sending him to 
Athens to be unmasked. Sup- 
pose," he said unpleasantly, "you 
give us the actual facts!" 

Coburn nodded. "The idea you 
find you can't take is that crea- 
tures that aren't human can be on 
Earth and pass for human beings. 
There's some evidence on that 
right here." He nodded to the 
Greek major who was the junior 
officer in the room. "Major, will 
you show these other gentlemen 
the palm of your hand?" 

The Greek major frowned per- 
plexedly. He lifted his hand and 
looked at it. Then his face went 
absolutely impassive. 

"I'm ready to shoot!" snapped 
Coburn. "Show them your hand. 
I can tell now." 

He felt the tensing of the others 
in the room, not toward the major 
but toward him. They were pre- 
paring to jump him, thinking him 
mad. 

But the major grinned ruefully: 
"Clever, Mr. Coburn! But how 
did you pick me out?" 

Then there was a sensation of 
intolerable brightness all around. 
But it was not actual light. It was 
a sensation inside one's brain. 

Coburn felt himself falling. He 
knew , somehow, that the others 



THE INVADERS 



129 



were falling too. He saw everyone 
in the room in the act of slumping 
limply to the floor — all but the 
Greek major. And Coburn felt a 
bitter, despairing fury as con- 
sciousness left him. 

IV 

He came to in a hospital room, 
with a nurse and two doctors and 
an elaborate oxygen-administering 
apparatus. The apparatus was 
wheeled out. The nurse followed. 
The two doctors hurried after her. 
The American colonel of the air- 
port was standing by the bed on 
which Coburn lay, fully dressed. 

Coburn felt perfectly all right. 
He stirred. The American colonel 
said sourly: "You're not harmed. 
Nobody was. But Major Pangalos 
got away." 

Coburn sat up. There was a 
moment's bare trace of dizziness, 
and that was gone too. Coburn 
said: "Where's Miss Ames? What 
happened to her?" 

"She's getting oxygen," said 
the colonel. "We were rushed here 
from the airport, sleeping soundly 
just like those Bulgarians. Major 
Pangalos ordered it before he dis- 
appeared. Helicopters brought 
some Bulgarians down, by the 
way, and oxygen brought them to. 
So naturally they gave us the same 
treatment. Very effective." 

The colonel looked both chas- 
tened and truculent. "How'd you 
know Major Pangalos for what he 



was? He was accepted every- 
where as a man." 

"His eyes *ere queer," said 
Coburn. He stood up experimen- 
tally. "I figured they would be, if 
one looked. I saw the foam suit 
that creature wore up-country, 
when he wasn't in it. There were 
holes for the eyes. It occurred to 
me that his eyes weren't likely to 
be like ours. Not exactly. So I 
hunted up the real Dillon, and his 
eyes weren't like I remembered. I 
punched him in the nose, by the 
way, to make sure he'd bleed and 
was human. He was." 

Coburn continued, "You see. 
they obviously come from a heavy 
planet and move differently, 
They're stronger than we are. 
Much like the way we'd be on the 
moon with one-sixth Earth grav- 
ity. They probably are used to a 
thicker atmosphere. If so, their 
eyes wouldn't be right for here. 
They'd need eyeglasses." 

"Major Pangalos didn't — " 

"Contact eyeglasses," said Co- 
burn sourly. "Little cups of plas- 
tic. They slip under the eyelids 
and touch the white part of the 
eye. Familiar enough. But that's 
not all." 

The American colonel looked 
troubled. " I know contact lenses," 
he admitted. "But -" 

"If the Invaders have a thick 
atmosphere at home," Coburn 
said, "they may have a cloudy 
sky. The pupils of their eyes may 
need to be larger. Perhaps they're 



130 



 



a different shape. Or their eyes 
may be a completely alien color. 
Anyhow, they need contact lenses 
not only to correct their vision, 
but to make their eyes look like 
ours. They're painted on the in- 
side to change the natural look 
and color. It's very deceptive. 
But you can tell." 

"That goes to Headquarters at 
once!" snapped the colonel. 

He went out briskly. Coburn 
followed him out of the room to 
look for Janice. And Janice hap- 
pened to be looking for him at 
exactly the same moment. He was 
genuinely astonished to realize 
how relieved he was that she was 
all right. 

He said apologetically : "I was 
worried! When I felt myself pass- 
ing out I felt pretty rotten at 
having failed to protect you." 

She looked at him with nearly 
the same sort of surprised satis- 
faction. "I'm all right," she said 
breathlessly. "I was worried about 
you." 

The roaring of motors outside 
the hospital interrupted them. 
More and more vehicles arrived, 
until a deep purring filled the air. 
A Greek doctor with a worried 
expression hurried somewhere. 
Soldiers appeared, hard-bitten, 
tough, professional Greek soldiers. 
Hallen came out of a hospital 
room. The Greek general appeared 
with one of the two colonels who'd 
been at the airport. The general 
nodded, and his eyes seemed cor- 

THE INVADERS 



dial. I Ie waved them ahead of 
him into a waiting elevator. The 
elevator descended. They went 
out of the hospital and there was 
an armored car waiting. An im- 
pressive escort of motorcycle 
troops waited with it.. 

The Greek general saw Co- 
burn's cynical expression at sight 
of the guards. He explained 
blandly that since oxygen brought 
sleeping Bulgarians out of their 
slumber — and had been used on 
them — oxygen was handy for use 
by anybody who experienced a 
bright flash of light in his mind. 
The Bulgarian soldiers, inciden- 
tally, said that outside the village 
of Ardea they'd felt as if the 
sunlight had brightened amaz- 
ingly, but they felt no effects for 
two hours afterward, when they 
fell asleep at Naousa. So, said the 
general almost unintelligibly, if 
anything untoward happened on 
the way to the airport, everybody 
would start breathing oxygen. A 
sensation of bright light would be 
untoward. 

The armored car started off, 
with motorcyclists crowded about 
it with weapons ready. But the 
ride in the airport was uneventful. 
To others than Janice and Coburn 
it may even have been tedious. 
But when she understood the 
general's explanation, she shiv- 
ered a little. She leaned insensibly 
closer to Coburn. He took her 
hand protectively in his. 

131 



They reached the airport. They 
roared through the gateway and 
directly out upon the darkened 
held. Something bellowed and 
raced down a runway and took to 
the air. Other things followed it. 
They gained altitude and circled 
back overhead. Tiny bluish Bick- 
erings moved across the overcast 
sky. Exhaust flames. 

Coburn realized that it was a 
fighter plane escort- 

The huge transport plane that 
waited for them was dark. They 
climbed into it and found their 
sells. When it roared clown the 
unhghted field and took to the 
air, everything possible had been 
done to keep anybody from bring 
ing any weapon to bear upon it. 

"All safe now!" said the voice 
of the American colonel in the 
darkness of the unlit plane, as the 
plane gained height. "Inciden- 
tally, Coburn, why did you want 
to look at Pangalos' palm? What 
did you expect to find there?" 

"When 1 started for the air- 
port," Coburn explained, "I bent 
a pin around the band of a ring I 
wear. I could let it lie flat when I 
shook hands. Or I could make it 
stand out like a spur. I set it with 
my thumb. I saw Pangalos' eyes, 
so I had it stand out, and I made a 
tear in his plastic skin when 1 
shook hands with him. He didn't 
feel it, of course." He paused. 
" Did anybody go to the address I 
gave Hallan ?" 

Hallan said, in the darkness: 



"Major Pangalos got there first." 

The blackness outside the plane 
seemed to grow deeper. There was 
literally nothing to be seen but the 
instrument dials up at the pilots' 
end of the ship. 

The Greek general asked a ques- 
tion in his difficult English. 

1 ' Where'd they come from ? " 
repeated Coburn. "I've no idea. 
Off Earth, yes. A heavy planet, 
yes. 1 doubt they come from our 
solar system, though. Somewhere 
among the stars." 

The Greek general said some- 
thing with a sly up-twist of his 
voice. Whatever and whoever the 
Invaders were, he said, they did 
not like Bulgarians. If they'd 
knocked out the raiding party 
simply to test their weapons 
against human subjects, at least 
they had chosen suitable and 
pleasing subjects for the test. 

There was light. For an instant 
Coburn tensed. But the plane 
climbed and the brightness stead- 
ied. It was the top of a cloud 
bank, brilliantly white in the 
moonlight. They had flown up 
through it, and it reached as far 
ahead as they could see. A stubby 
lighter plane swam up out of the 
mist and fell into position along- 
side. Others appeared- They took 
formation about the transport and 
all flew steadily through the 
moonlight. 

"I wish I knew," said the 
American colonel vexedly, "if 



132 



AMAZING STOKIKS 



those creatures were only testing 
weapons, or if they were getting 
set to start bargaining with us!" 

"Meaning?" asked Coburn. 

"If they're here," said the 
colonel angrily, "and if they do 
mean to meddle in our business, 
they may set up a sort of auction 
with us bidding against the Iron 
Curtain gang for their friendship. 
And they'd make any deal!" 

The Greek general agreed drily. 
He said that free people were not 
practical people. They were al- 
ways ready to die rather than 
cease to be free. Surely the 
Greeks had proved themselves 
ready to die. But people like the 
Bulgarians thought that to con- 
tinue to live was the most im- 
portant thing in the world. It was, 
of course, the practical view- 
point. . . . 

"They can have it!" growled 
Coburn. 

Janice said hesitantly: "But 
the Invaders haven't killed any- 
body we know of. They could 
have killed the Bulgarians. They 
didn't. The one who called him- 
self Dillon stopped one man from 
killing them. And they could have 
killed us, earlier today at the air- 
port. Could they want to be 
friends? " 

"They're starting the wrong 
way," said Coburn. 

The Greek general stirred in his 
seat, but he was pointedly silent. 

The pilot snapped abruptly 
from up at the bow of the plane: 



"Colonel! sir! Two of the fighters 
are climbing as if they've spotted 
something. There go the rest." 

Coburn leaned across Janice to 
stare out the window- When the 
fighters were below the transport, 
they could be seen in silhouette 
against the clouds. Above, their 
exhaust flames pin-pointed them. 
Small blue flames climbed steeply. 

The big ship went on. The roar 
of i ts motors was steady and 
unvarying. From a passenger seat 
it was not possible to look over- 
head. But suddenly there were 
streaking sparks against the stars. 
Tracer bullets. Fighters swerved 
and plunged to intercept some- 
thing. . . . 

And a Thing came down out of 
the sky with a terrific velocity. 
Tracer bullets sprayed all around 
it. Some could be seen to richochet 
off its sides. Flashings came from 
the alien craft. They were not ex- 
plosions from guns. They were 
lurid, actintic, smokeless blasts 
of pure light. The Thing seemed 
to be made of polished metal. It 
dodged, trying to approach the 
transport. The fighters lunged to 
prevent it. The ghastly game of 
interception seemed to rush here 
and there all over the sky. 

The strange object was not pos- 
sibly of human design or manu- 
facture. It had no wings. It left 
no trail of jet fumes or rocket 
smoke. It was glittering and mir- 
ror-like, and it was shaped almost 



THE INVADERS 



133 



exactly like two turtle-shells base 
to base. It was flat and oval. It 
had no visible external features. 

It flung itself about with in- 
credible darts and jerkings. It 
could stop stock still as no plane 
could possibly stop, and accelerate 
at a rate no human body could 
endure. It tried savagely to get 
through the swarming fighters to 
the transport. Its light weapon 
flashed — but the pilots would be 
_ wearing oxygen masks and there 
were no casualties among the hu- 
man planes. Once a fighter did 
fall off in a steep dive, and flut- 
tered almost down to the cloud 
bank before it recovered and came 
back with its guns spitting. 

That one appeared to end the 
fight. It came straight up, pump- 
ing tracers at the steel flier from 
below. And the glittering Thing 
seemed to stop dead in the air. 
Then it shuddered. It was bathed 
in the flaring sparks of tracers. 
Then — 

It dropped like a stone, tum- 
bling aimlessly over and over as it 
dropped. It plummeted into the 
cloud bank. 

Suddenly the clouds were 
lighted from within. Something 
inside flared with a momentary, 
terrifying radiance. No lightning 
bolt ever flashed more luridly. 

The transport plane and its 
escort flew on and on over the 
moonlit bank of clouds. 

Presently orders came by radio. 
On the report of this attack, the 



flight plan would be changed, for 
safety. If the air convoy had been 
attacked once, it might be at- 
tacked again. So it would be 
wisest to get it immediately to 
where there would be plenty of 
protection. Therefore, the trans- 
port plane would head for Naples. 

Nearly the whole of the United 
States Mediterranean fleet was in 
the Bay of Naples just then. It 
had been there nearly a week, and 
by day its liberty parties swarmed 
ashore. The merchants and the 
souvenir salesmen were entranced. 
American sailors had money and 
they spent it. The fleet's officers 
were social assets, its messes 
bought satisfyingly of local vi- 
ands, and everybody was happy. 

All but one small group. The 
newspapers of one of the Italian 
political parties howled infuri- 
atedly. They had orders to howl, 
from behind the Iron Curtain. 
The American fleet, that one 
party's newspapers bellowed, was 
imperialistic, capitalistic, and de- 
cadent. In short, there was viru- 
lent propaganda against the Amer- 
ican fleet in Naples. But most 
people were glad it was there any- 
way. Certainly nobody stayed 
awake worrying about it. 

People were staying awake 
worrying about the transport 
plane carrying Coburn and Janice, 
however. On the plane, Janice was 
fearful and pressed close to Co- 
burn, and he found it an absorbing 



134 



 



experience and was moved to fall; 
in a low tone about other matters 
than extra-terrestrial I n vaders 
and foam suits and interstellar 
travel. Janice found those other 
subjects surprisingly fitted to 
make her forget about being 
afraid. 

Elsewhere, the people who 
stayed awake did talk about just 
the subjects Coburn was avoiding. 
I he convoy carrying Cob urn to 
tell what he knew had been 
attacked. By a plane which was 
definitely not made or manned 
by human beings. The news 
Hashed through the air across 
continents. It went under the 
ocean over sea beds. It traveled 
in the tightest and most closely- 
guarded of diplomatic codes. The 
Greek government gave the other 
NATO nations a confidential ac- 
count of the Bulgarian raid and 
what had happened to it- These 
details were past question. The 
facts brought out by Coburn were 
true, too. 

So secret instructions followed 
the news. At first they went only 
to highly-trusted individuals. In 
thirty nations, top-ranking officials 
and military officers blindfolded 
each other in turn and gravely 
stuck pins in each other. The 
blindfolded person was expected 
to name (he place where he had 
been stuck. This had an historical 
precedent. In olden days, pins 
were stuck in suspected witches. 
They had patches of" skin in which 



I here was no sensation, and dis- 
covery of such areas condemned 
them to death. Psychologists in 
later centuries found that patches 
of anaesthetic skin were typical of 
certain forms of hysteria, and 
therefore did not execute their pa- 
tients. But the Invaders, by the 
fact that their seemingly human 
bodies were not flesh at all, could 
not pass such tests. 

There were consequences. A 
Minister of Defense of a European 
nation amusedly watched the 
tests on his subordinates, blandly 
excused himself for a moment be- 
fore his own turn came, and did 
not come back. A general of di- 
vision vanished into thin air. 
Diplomatic code clerks painstak- 
ingly decoded the instructions for 
such tests, and were nowhere 
about when they themselves were 
to be tested. An eminent Holly- 
wood director and an Olympic 
champion ceased to be. 

In the free world nearly a hun- 
dred prominent individuals simply 
disappeared. Few were in position 
to influence high-level decisions. 
Many were in line to know rather 
significant details of world affairs. 
There was alarm. 

It was plain, too, that not all 
disguised Invaders would have 
had to vanish. Many would not 
even be called on for test. They 
would stay where they were. And 
there were private persons. . . . 

There was consternation. But 



THE INVADERS 



135 



Janice, in the plane, was saying 
sof tl y to Coburn : 1 ' The — crea- 
ture who telephoned and said she 
was me. How did you know she 
wasn't ? " 

"I went to the Breen Founda- 
tion first," said Coburn. " 1 looked 
into your eyes — and they were 
right. So I didn't need to stick a 
pin in you." 

The thought of Coburn not 
needing to stick a pin in her im- 
pressed Janice as beautiful trust. 
She sighed contentedly. "Of 
course you'd know," she said. 
"So would I — now!" She laughed 
a little. 

The convoy flew on. The lurid 
round disk of the moon descended 
toward the west. 

"It'll be sunrise soon. But I 
imagine we'll land before dawn." 

They did. The flying group of 
planes flew lower. Coburn saw 
a single light on the ground. It 
was very tiny, and it vanished 
rearward with great speed. Later 
there was another light, and a 
dull-red glow in the sky. Still later, 
infinitesimal twinklings on the 
ground at the horizon. They in- 
creased in number but not in size, 
.and die plane swung hugely to the 
left, and the lights on the ground 
formed a visible pattern. And 
moonlight — broken by the shad- 
ows of clouds — displayed the 
city Mid the Bay of Naples below. 

The transport plane landed. 
The passengers descended. Co- 
burn saw Hallen, the American 



colonel, the Creek general, and a 
Greek colonel. The other had been 
left behind to take charge of 
things in Salonika. Here the uni- 
forms were American, and naval. 
There were some Italian police 
in view, but most of the men 
about were American seamen, os- 
tensibly on shore leave. But Co- 
bum doubted very much if they 
were as completely unarmed as 
men on shore leave usually are. 

A man in a cap with much gold 
braid greeted the American colo- 
nel, the Greek general, and the 
Greek colonel. He came to Co- 
burn, to whose arm Janice seemed 
to cling. 

"We're taking you out to the 
fleet. We've taken care of every- 
thing. Everybody's had pins stuck 
in him ! " 

It was very humorous, of 
course. They moved away from 
the plane. Surrounded by white- 
clad sailors, the party from the 
plane moved into the hangar. 

Then a voice snapped a startled 
question, in English. An instant 
later it rasped : "Stop or I'll 
shoot ! " 

Then there was a bright flash of 
light. The interior of the hangar 
was made vivid by it. It went out. 
And as it disapjieared there were 
the sounds of running footsteps. 
Only they did not run properly. 
They ran in great leaps. Impossi- 
ble leaps. Monstrous leaps. A 
man might run like that on the 
moon, with a lesser gravity. A 



 



creature accustomed to much 
greater gravity might run like 
that on Earth. But it would not 
be human. 
It got away. 

There was a waiting car. They 
got into it. They pulled out from 
the airport with other cars close 
before and behind. The cavalcade 
raced for the city and the shore- 
line surrounded by a guard less 
noisy but no less effective than 
the Greek motorcycle troopers. 

But the Greek general said 
something meditative in the dark 
interior of the car. 

' ' What's that ? ' ' demanded 
someone authoritatively. 

The Greek . general said it 
again, mildly. This latest attempt 
to seize them or harm them — 
if it was that — had been surpris- 
ingly inept. It was strange that 
creatures able to travel between 
the stars and put regiments and 
tanks out of action should fail so 
dismally to kill or kidnap Coburn, 
if they really wanted to. Could it 
be that they were not quite sin- 
cere in their efforts? 

"That," said the authoritative 
voice, "is an idea!" 

They readied the waterfront. 
And here in the darkest part of 
the night and with the moon near 
to setting, the waters of the Bay 
of Naples rolled in small, smooth- 
surfaced, tranquil waves. There 
was a Navy barge waiting. Those 
who had come by plane boarded 
it. It cast off and headed out into 



the middle of the huge harbor. 

In minutes there was a giant 
hull looming overhead. They 
stepped out onto a landing ladder 
and climbed interminably up the 
ship's metal side. Then there was 
an open door. 

"Now," said the American 
colonel triumphantly, "now ev- 
erything's all right! Nothing can 
happen now, short of an atomic 
bomb! " 

The Greek general glanced at 
him out of the corner of his eyes. 
He said something in that heavy 
accent of his. He asked mildly if 
creatures — Invaders — who 
could travel between the stars 
were unlikely to be able to make 
atom bombs if they wanted to. 

There was no answer. But some- 
body led Coburn into an office 
where this carrier's skipper was 
at his desk. He looked at Coburn 
with a sardonic, unfriendly eye. 

"Mr. Coburn, I believe," he 
said remotely. "You've been very 
welt staged-managed by your 
friends, Mr. Coburn. They've 
made it look as if they were trying 
hard to kill you, eh? But we know 
better, don't we? We know it's all 
a build-up for you to make a deal 
for them, eh? Well, Mr. Coburn, 
you'll find it's going to be a let- 
down instead ! You're not officially 
under arrest, but I wouldn't 
advise you to try to start any- 
thing, Mr. Coburn! We're apt to 
be rather crude in dealing with 
emissaries of enemies of all the 



THE INVADERS 



1,17 




138 



human race. And don't forget it!" 

And this was Coburn's first 
inkling that he was regarded as a 
traitor of his planet who had sold 
out to the Invaders. All the plans 
made from his information would 
be based on the supposition that 
he intended to betray mankind 
by misleading it. 

V 

It was not yet forty-eight hours 
since Coburn had been inter- 
rupted in the act of starting his 
car up in Ardea. Greek newspa- 
pers had splashed lurid headlines 
of a rumored invasion by Bul- 
garians, and their rumored defeat. 
The story was not widely copied. 
It sounded too unlikely. In a 
few hours it would be time for a 
new set of newspapers to begin to 
appear. Not one of them would 




print a single word about the most 
important disclosure in human 
history: that extra-terrestrial In- 
vaders moved blandly about 
among human beings without 
being suspected. 

The newspapers didn't know it. 
On inside pages and bottom cor- 
ners, the London papers might 
refer briefly to the remarkable 
rumor that had swept over Greece 
about an invasion force said to 
have crossed its border. The Lon- 
don papers would say that the 
Greek government officially de- 
nied that such a happening had 
taken place. The New York pa- 
pers would be full of a political 
scandal among municipal officials, 
the Washington papers would deal 
largely with a Congressional in- 
vestigation committee hearing, 
Los Angeles would have a new 
and gory murder to exploit, San 
Francisco news would be of a 
water-front strike, Tokyo would 
talk of cherry blossoms, Delhi 
of Pakistan, and the French press 
would discuss the political crisis. 
But no newspaper, anywhere, 
would talk about Invaders. 

In the United States radar 
technicians had been routed out of 
bed and informed that night 
fighters had had a fight with an 
alien ship manned by non-hu- 
mans and had destroyed it, but 
their radars detected nothing at 
all. An hour after sunrise in Naples 
they had come up with a combina- 



139 



tion of radar frequencies which 
were built to detect everything. 
Instructions were going out in 
code to all radar establishments 
on how to set it up on existing 
equipment. Long before that time, 
business machines had begun in- 
tricate operations with punched 
cards containing all known facts 
about the people known to have 
dropped out of sight. Other ma- 
chines began to integrate crackpot 
reports of things sighted in divers 
places. The stores of Hunter and 
Nereid rockets — especially the 
remote-control jobs — were brok- 
en out. Great Air Transport 
planes began to haul them to 
where they might be needed. 

In England, certain establish- 
ments that had never been men- 
tioned even in Parliament were 
put on war alert. There was fran- 
tic scurrying-about in France. In 
Sweden a formerly ignored scien- 
tist was called to a twice-scram- 
bled telephone connection and 
consulted at length about objects 
reported over Sweden's skies. 
The Canadian Air Force tumbled 
out in darkness and was briefed. 
In Chile there was agitation, and 
in Peru. 

' There was earnest effort to 
secure cooperation from behind 
the Iron Curtain, but that did not 
work. The Iron Curtain stood pat, 
demanding the most detailed of 
information and the privilege of 
inspecting all weapons intended 
for use against anybody so far 



unnamed, but refusing all infor- 
mation of its own. In fact, there 
was a very normal reaction every- 
where, except that the newspapers 
didn't know anything to print. 

These secret hassles were con- 
tinuing as the dawnlight moved 
over Italy and made Naples and 
its harbor quite the most beauti- 
ful place in the world. When day- 
light rolled over France, matters 
were beginning to fall into pat- 
tern. As daybreak moved across 
the Atlantic, at least the measures 
to be taken began to be visualized 
and orders given for their ac- 
complishment. 

And then, with sunrise in Amer- 
ica, real preparations got under 
way. 

But hours earlier there was con- 
sultation on the carrier in the Bay 
of Naples. Coburn sat in a ward- 
room in a cold fury which was in 
part despair. He had been kept in 
complete ignorance of all meas- 
ures taken, and he felt the raging 
indignation of a man accused of 
treason. He was being questioned 
again. He was treated with an icy 
courtesy that was worse than 
accusation. The carrier skipper 
mentioned with detachment that, 
of course, Coburn had never been 
in any danger. Obviously. The 
event in the airport at Salonika 
and the attack on the convoy 
were window-dressing. They were 
not attempts to withdraw him 
from circulation, but to draw at- 
tention to him. Which, of course, 



140 



AMAZING STOK1ES 



implied that the Invaders — who- 
ever or whatever they might be — 
considered Coburn a useful tool 
for whatever purpose they in- 
tended. 

Tins was before the conference 
officially began. It took time to 
arrange. There were radio tech- 
nicians with microphones. The 
consultation — - duly scrambled 
and re-scrambled — would be re- 
layed to Washington while it was 
on. It was a top level conference. 
Hallen was included, but he did 
not seem happy. 

Then things were ready. The 
skipper of the carrier took over, 
with full awareness that the very 
highest brass in Washington was 
listening to every word. 

"We can skip your technical 
information, Mr. Coburn," he 
said with ironic courtesy, "unless 
you've something new to offer." 

Coburn shook his head. He 
seethed. 

"For the record," said the skip- 
per, "J repeat that it is obvious 
that your presence at the scene 
when those Bulgarians were 
knocked out, that you were at- 
tacked in Salonika, that the ship 
carrying you was also attacked, 
and that there was an incident on 
your landing here: — it's obvious 
that all these things were stage-, 
managed to call attention to you, 
for the purposes of . . . whoever 
staged them. Have you anything 
more to offer?" 



"No," growled Coburn. "I've 
told all I know." He was furiously 
angry and felt completely help- 
less. 

"Your information, " purred the 
Skipper, "and the stage-managed 
incidents, make you look like a 
very patriotic citizen who is 
feared by the supposedly extra- 
terrestrial creatures. But we don't 
have to play any longer, Mr. Co- 
burn. What were you told to tell 
your government? What do these 
. . . extra-terrestrials want?" 

"My guess," snapped Coburn, 
"is that they want Earth." 

The skipper raised his eyebrows. 
"Are you threatening us in their 
name?" he asked, purring. 

"I'm telling you my guess," 
said Coburn hotly. "It's just as 
good as yours and no better! I 
have no instructions from them. 
1 have no message from them. 
I've only my own opinion, which 
is that we humans had better get 
ready to fight. I believe we ought 
to join together — all of Earth — 
and get set to defend ourselves." 

There was silence. Coburn found 
himself regarding the faces around 
him with an unexpected trucu- 
lcnce. Janice pressed his hand 
warningly. 

"AH of Earth," said the skipper 
softly. "Hmmmm. You advise an 
arrangement with all the earth. 
. . . What are your politics, Mr. 
Coburn? — No, let us say, what 
are the political views of the ex- 
tra-terrestrial creatures you tell 



Tirr; intvadilrs 



141 



us about? We have to know." 

Coburn seethed. " If you're sug- 
gest! rig that this is a cold war 
trick," he said furiously, " — if 
they were faking it, they wouldn't 
try tricks! They'd make war! 
They'd try conquest!" 

Coburn saw the stout Greek 
general nodding to himself. Bui 
the Skipper said suavely: "You 
were with one of the creatures, 
you say, up in the village of 
Naousa. Would you say he seemed 
unfriendly to the Bulgarians?" 

"He was playing the part of an 
Englishman," snapped Coburn, 
"trying to stop a raid, and mur- 
ders, and possibly a war — all of 
them unnecessary!" 

"You don't paint a frightening 
picture," complained the skipper 
ironically. " First you say we have 
to fight him and his kind, and then 
you imply that he was highly al- 
truistic. What is the fact?" 

"Dammit!" said Coburn. "I 
hated him because he wasn't hu- 
man. Jt made my flesh crawl to 
see him act so much like a man 
when he wasn't. But he made me 
feel ashamed when 1 held a gun on 
him and he proved he wasn't hu- 
man just so Janice — so Miss 
Ames wouldn't be afraid to drive 
down to Salonika with me!" 

"So you have some . . . 
friendly feelings toward him, eh? " 
the skipper said negligently. 
"How will you get in touch with 
his kind, by the way? //we should 
ask you to? Of course you've got 



it all arranged? Just in case,*' 

Coburn knew that absolutely 
nothing could be done with a man 
who was trying to show off his 
shrewdness to his listening supe- 
riors. He said disgustedly: "That's 
the last straw. Go to hell I" 

A loud-speaker spoke suddenly. 
Its tone was authoritative, and 
there were little cracklings of 
static in it from its passage across 
the Atlantic. 

"That line of questioning can 
be dropped, Captain. Mr. Coburn, 
did these aliens have any other 
chances to kill you?" 

"Plenty!" snapped Coburn. 
"And easy ones. One of them 
came into my office as my secre- 
tary. She could have killed me. 
The man who passed for Major 
Pangalos could have shot us all 
while we were unconscious. I 
don't know why they didn't get 
the transport plane, and I don t 
know what their scheme is. I'm 
telling the facts. They're contra- 
dictory. I can't help that. All I 
have are the facts." 

The loud-speaker said crisply: 
"The attack on the transport 
plane — any pilots present who 
were in that fight?" 

Someone at the back said: 
"Yes, sir. Here." 

"How good was their sh ip ? 
Could it have been a guided mis- 
sile? " 

"No, sir. No guided missile. 
Whoever drove that ship was 
right on board. And that ship was 



142 



 



good. It could climb as fast as we 
could dive, and no human could 
have taken the accelerations and 
the turns it made. Whoever drove 
it learned fast, too. He was clumsy 
at the beginning, but be learned. 
If we hadn't gotten in a lucky hit 
he'd've had us where he wanted 
us in a little while more. Our 
fiftv-calibres just bounced off that 
hull!" 

The loud-speaker said curtly: 
"If that impression is justified, 
that's the first business to be 
taken up. All but flying officers 
are excused. Mr. Coburn can go, 
too." 

There was a stirring everywhere 
in the room. Officers got up and 
walked out. Coburn stood. The 
Greek general came over to him 
and patted him on the shoulder, 
beaming. Janice went out with 
him. They arrived on the carrier's 
deck. This was the very earliest 
hour of dawn, and the conference 
had turned abruptly to a discus- 
sion of arms and tactics as soon as 
Washington realized that its 
planes were inadequate for fight- 
ing. Which was logical enough, 
but Coburn was pretty sure it was 
useless. 

"If anybody else in the world 
feels as futile as I do," said Co- 
burn bitterly, "I feel sorry for 
him!" 

Janice said softly: "You've got 
me." 

But that was less than complete 
comfort. It is inborn in a man that 



lie needs In feel superior. No man 
can feel pride before the woman 
of his choice while there is some- 
thing stronger than himself. And 
Coburn especially wanted to feel 
that pride just now. 

There were very probably dis- 
cussions of the important part of 
what Coburn had reported, of 
co u rse , during the rest of the 
morning. But there was much 
more discussion of purely military 
measures. And of course there 
were attempts to get military in- 
telligence. Things were reported 
in the sky near South Africa, and 
from Honolulu — - where nobody 
would ignore what a radar said 
again, especially the juiced-up 
eq uipmcn t j ust modified on or- 
ders — and from other places. 
Not all the reports were authentic, 
of course. If there were any ob- 
servations inside the Iron Curtain, 
the Iron Curtain countries kept 
them to themselves. Politics was 
much more important than any- 
thing else, in that part of the 
world. 

Hut Coburn need not have felt 
as futile as he did. There was just 
one really spectacular occurrence 
in connection with the Invaders 
that day, and it happened where 
Coburn was. Almost certainly, it 
happened because Coburn was 
there. Though there is reason to 
believe that the newspaper cam- 
paign on shore, declaring that the 
American fleet risked the lives of 
all Naples by its mere presence. 



THE INVADKRS 



143 



had something to do with it too. 
It was very spectacular. 

It happened just after midday 
when the city and its harbor were 
at their most glamorous. Coburn 
and Janice were above when it 
began. There was an ensign as- 
signed to escort Coburn about 
and keep an eye on him, and he 
took them on a carefully edited 
tour of the carrier. He took them 
to the radar room which was not 
secret any longer. He explained 
reservedly that there was a new 
tricked-up arrangement of radar 
which it was believed would de- 
tect turtle-shaped metal ships if 
they appeared. 

The radar room was manned, of 
course. It always was, with a cold 
war in being. Overhead, the bowl 
cages of the radars moved rest- 
lessly and rhythmically. Outside, 
on deck, the huge elevator that 
brought planes up from below 
rose at the most deliberate of 
peace-time rates. 

The ensign said negligently, 
pointing to the radar-screen: 
"That little speck is a plane mak- 
ing for the landing field on shore. 
This other one is a plane coming 
down from Genoa. You'd need a 
good pair of binoculars to see it. 
It's a good thirty-five miles away." 

Just then, one of the two radar- 
men on duty pushed a button and 
snapped into a microphone: "Sirl 
Radar-pip directly overhead! Does 
not show on normal radar. Ele- 



vation three hundred thousand 
feet, descending rapidly." His 
voice cut off suddenly. 

A metallic voice said : " Relay ! " 

The ensign in charge of Coburn 
and Janice seemed to freeze. The 
radar man pressed a button, which 
would relay that particular radar- 
screen's contents to the control 
room for the whole ship. There 
was a pause of seconds. Then bells 
began to ring everywhere. They 
were battle gongs. 

There was a sensation of stirring 
all over the ship. Doors closed 
with soft hissings. Men ran furi- 
ously. The gongs rang. 

The ensign said politely: "I'll 
take you below now." 

He led them very swiftly to a 
flight of stairs. There was a mon- 
strous bellowing on the carrier's 
deck. Something dark went hurt- 
ling down its length, with a tail of 
pale-blue flame behind it. It van- 
ished. Men were still running. 
The elevator shot into full-speed 
ascent. A plane rolled off it. The 
elevator dropped. 

An engine roared. Another. Yet 
another. A second dark and deadly 
thing flashed down the deck and 
was gone. There was a rumbling. 

The battle gongs cut off. The 
rumbling below seemed to in- 
crease. There was a curious vi- 
bration. The ship moved. Coburn 
could feel that it moved. It was 
turning. 

The ensign led them somewhere 
and said: "This is a good place. 



144 



AMAZING STORIICS 



You'd better stay right here." 

He ran. They heard him run- 
ning. He was gone. 

They were in a sort of ward 
room — not of the morning con- 
ference — and there were port- 
holes through which they could 
look. The city which was Naples 
seemed to swing smoothly past 
the ship. They saw other ships. A 
cruiser was under way with its 
anchor still rising from the water. 
It dripped mud and a sailor was 
quite ridiculously playing a hose 
on it. It ascended and swayed and 
its shank went smoothly into the 
hawse-hole. There were guns 
swinging skyward. Some were 
still covered by canvas hoods. The 
hoods vanished before the cruiser 
swung out of the porthole's line of 
vision. 

A destroyer leaped across the 
space they could see, full speed 
ahead. The water below them be- 
gan to move more rapidly. It 
began to pass by with the speed of 
ground past an express train. 
And continually, monotonously, 
there were roarings which cli- 
maxed and died in the distance. 

"The devil!" said Coburn. 
"I've got to see this. They can't 
kill us for looking." 

He opened the door. Janice, 
holding fast to his arm, followed 
as he went down a passage. An- 
other door. They were on the deck 
side of the island which is the 
superstructure of a carrier, and 

THE INVADERS 



they were well out of the way, 
and everybody in sight was too 
busy to notice them. 

The elevator worked like the 
piston of a pump. It vanished and 
reappeared and a plane came off. 
Men in vividly-colored suits 
swarmed about it, and the eleva- 
tor was descending again. The 
plane roared, shot rlown the deck, 
and was gone to form one of the 
string of climbing objects which 
grew smaller with incredible 
swiftness as they shot for the sky. 
Coburn saw another carrier. There 
was a huge bow-wave before it. 
Destroyers ringed it, seeming to> 
bounce in the choppy sea made 
by so many great ships moving so 
close together. 

The other carrier, too, was 
shooting planes into the air like 
bullets from a gun. The American 
Mediterranean fleet was putting 
out to sea at emergency-speed, 
getting every flying craft aloft 
that could be gotten away. A 
cruiser swung a peculiar crane- 
like arm, there was a puff of smoke 
and a plane came into being. The 
crane retracted. Another plane. 
A third. 

The fleet was out of the harbor, 
speeding at thirty knots, with 
destroyers weaving back and forth 
at higher speeds still. There were 
barges left behind in the harbor 
with sailors in them, — shore- 
parties or details who swore bit- 
terly when they were left behind. 
They surged up and down on the 

145 



melee of waves the fleet left 
behind in its hasty departure. 

On the fleet itself there was a 
brisk tenseness as it sped away 
from the land. Vesuvius still 
loomed high, but the city dwin- 
dled to a mere blinking mass of 
white specks which were its build- 
ings. The sea was aglitter with 
sunlight reflected from the waves. 
There was the smell of salt air. 

Men began to take cryptic 
measures for the future. They 
strung cables across the deck 
from side to side. Arresting gear 
for planes which would presently 
land. 

Their special ensign found Co- 
burn and Janice. "I'm supposed 
to stay with you," he explained 
politely. "I thought I could he of 
use. 1 'm really attached to another 
ship, hut I was on board because 
of the hassle last night." 

Coburn said: "This would be 
invader stuff, wouldn't it?" 

The ensign shrugged. "Appar- 
ently. You heard what the radar 
said. Something at three hundred 
thousand feet, descending rapidly. 
It's not a human-built ship. Any- 
way, we've sent up all our planes. 
Jets will meet it first, at fifty 
thousand. If it gets through them 
there are . . . other measures, 
of course." 

"This one beats me!" said Co- 
burn. "Why?" 

The ensign shrugged again. 
"They tried for you last night." 

"I'm not that important, to 



them or anybody else. Or am I?*' 
" I wouldn't know," said the 
ensign. 

" I don't know anything 1 
haven't told," said Coburn grimly, 
"and the creatures can't suppress 
any information by killing me 
now. Anyhow, if they'd wanted to 
they'd have done it." 

A dull, faint sound came from 
high overhead. Coburn stepped 
out from under the shelter of the 
upper works of the island. He 
stared up into the sky. He saw a 
lurid spot of blue-white flame. He 
saw others, lie realized that all 
the sky was interlaced with con- 
trails — vapor-trails of jet-planes 
far up out of sight. But thjsy were 
fine threads. The jets were up very 
high indeed. The pin-points of 
flame were explosions. 

"Using wing-rockets," said the 
ensign hungrily, "since fifty-cali- 
bres did no good last night, until 
one made a lucky hit. Rockets 
with proximity fuses. Our jets 
don't carry cannon." 

There were more explosions. 
There was a bright glint of re- 
flected sunshine. It was momen- 
tary, but Coburn knew that it 
was from a flat, bright space-ship, 
which had tilted in some mon- 
strously abrupt maneuver, and 
the almost vertical sunshine shone 
down from its surface. 

The ensign said in a very quiet 
voice: "The fight's coming lower." 

There was a crashing thump in 
the air. A battleship was firing 



146 



 



eight-inch guns almost straight 
up. Other guns began. 

Guns began to fire on the car- 
rier, too, below the deck and be- 
yond it. Concussion waves beat 
at Cobu rn 's body. He thrust 
Janice behind him to shield her, 
but there could be no shielding. 

The air was filled with barkings 
and snarlings and the unbelieva- 
bly abrupt roar of heavy guns. 
The carrier swerved, so swiftly 
that it tilted and swerved again. 
The other ships of the fleet broke 
their straight-away formation and 
began to move in bewildering 
patterns. The blue sea was criss- 
crossed with wakes. Once a de- 
stroyer seemed to slide almost 
under the bow of the carrier. The 
destroyer appeared unharmed on 
the other side, its guns all pointed 
skyward and emitting; seemingly 
continuous blasts of flame and 
thunder. 

The ensign grabbed Coburn 's 
shoulder and pointed, his hands 
shaking. 

There was the Invader ship. It 
was exactly as Coburn had known 
it would be. It was tiny. It seemed 
hardly larger than some of the 
planes that swooped at it. But the 
planes were drawing back now. 
The shining metal thing was no 
more than two thousand feet up 
and it was moving in erratic, un- 
predictable darts and dashes here 
and there, like a dragon-fly's 
movements, but a hundred times 



more swift. Proximity-fused shells 
burst everywhere about it. It 
burst through a still-expanding 
puff of explosive smoke, darted 
down a hundred feet, and took a 
zig-zag course of such violent and 
angular changes of position that it 
looked more like a streak of metal 
lightning than anything else. 

It was down to a thousand feet. 
It shot toward the fleet at a speed 
which was literally that of a 
projectile. It angled off to one side 
and back, and suddenly dropped 
again and plunged crazily through 
the maze of ships from one end to 
the other, no more than fifty feet 
above the water and with geysers 
of up-flung sea all about it from 
the shells that missed. 

Then it sped away with a veloc- 
ity which simply was not con- 
ceivable. It was the speed of a 
cannon ball. It was headed straight 
toward a distant, stubby, drag- 
gled tramp-steamer which plod- 
ded toward the Bay of Naples. 

It rose a little as it flew. And 
then it checked, in mid-air. It 
hung above the dumpy freighter, 
and there were salvoes of all the 
guns in the fleet. But at the 
flashes it shot skyward. When 
the shells arrived and burst, it 
was gone. 

It could still be sighted as a 
spark of sunlight shooting for the 
heavens. Jets roared toward it. It 
vanished. 

Coburn heard the ensign saying 
in a flat voice: "If that wasn't 



THE TNVADKHS 



14-7 



accelerating at fifteen Gs, I never 
saw a ship. If it wasn't acceler- 
ating at fifteen Gs . . ." 

And that was all. There was 
nothing else to shoot at. There 
was nothing else to do. Jets 
ranged widely, looking for some- 
thing that would offer battle, but 
the radars said that the metal 
ship had gone up to three hundred 
miles and then headed west and 
out of radar range. There had 
not been time for the French to set 
up paired radar-beam outfits any- 
how, so they couldn't spot it, and 
in any case its course seemed to be 
toward northern Spain, where 
there was no radar worth men- 
tioning. 

Presently somebody noticed the 
dingy, stubby, draggled tramp 
steamer over which the Invaders' 
craft had hovered. It was no 
longer on course. It had turned 
sidewise and wallowed heavily. 
Its bow pointed successively to 
every point of the compass. 

It looked bad. Salvos of the 
heaviest projectiles in the Fleet 
had been fired to explode a thou- 
sand feet above it. Perhaps — 

A destroyer went racing to see. 
As it drew near — Coburn learned 
this later — it saw a man's body 
hanging in a sagging heap over 
the railing of its bridge. There 
was nobody visible at the wheel. 
There were four men lying on its 
deck, motionless. 

The skipper of the destroyer 
went cold. He brought his ship 



closer. It was not big, this tramp. 
Maybe two thousand tons. It was 
low in the water. It swayed and 
surged and wallowed and rolled. 

Men from the destroyer man- 
aged to board it. It was completely 
unharmed. They found one small 
sign of the explosions overhead. 
One fragment of an exploded shell 
had fallen on board, doing no 
damage. 

Even the crew was unharmed. 
But every man was asleep. Each 
one slumbered heavily. Each 
breathed stertoriously. They could 
not be awakened . They would 
need oxygen to bring them to. 

A party from the destroyer 
went on board to bring the ship 
into harbor. The officer in charge 
tried to find out the ship's name. 

There was not a document to 
be found to show what the ship's 
name was or where it had come 
from or what it carried as cargo. 
That was strange. The officer 
looked in the pockets of the two 
men in the wheel house. There was 
not a single identifying object on 
cither of them. He grew disturbed. 
He made a really thorough search. 
Every sleeping man was abso- 
lutely anonymous. Then — still 
on the way to harbor — a really 
fine- tooth-comb examination of 
Lhe ship began. 

Somebody's radium-dial watch 
began to glow brightly. The 
searchers looked at each other and 
wen t pale. They hunted f ran-

tically, fear making them clumsy. 

They found it. Rather — they 
found them. 

The stubby tramp had an ade- 
quate if rather clumsy atomic 
bomb in each of its two holds. 
The lading of the ship was of ma- 
terials which — according to the- 
ory — should be detonated in 
atomic explosion if an atomic 
bomb went off nearby. Otherwise 
they could not be detonated. 

The anonymous tramp-steamer 
had been headed for the harbor of 
Naples, whose newspapers — at 
least those of a certain political 
party — had been screaming of 
the danger of an atomic explosion 
while American warships were 
anchored there. 

It was not likely that two atom 
bombs and a shipload of valuable 
secondary atomic explosive had 
been put on a carefully nameless 
ship just to be taken for a ride. If 
this ship had anchored among 
the American fleet and if it had 
exploded in the Bay of Na- 
ples . . . 

The prophecies of a certain 
political party would seem to have 
been fulfilled. The American ships 
would be destroyed. Naples itself 
would be destroyed. And it would 
have appeared that Europeans 
who loved the great United States 
had made a mistake. 

It was, odd, though, that this 
ship was the only one that the In- 
vaders' flying craft had struck 
with its peculiar weapon. 



VI 

We humans are rational beings, 
but we are not often reasonable. 
Those who more or less handle us 
in masses have to take account of 
that fact. It could not be ad- 
mitted that the fleet had had a 
fight with a ship piloted by In- 
vaders from another solar system. 
It would produce a wild panic, 
beside which even a war would be 
relatively harmless. So the ad- 
miral of the Mediterranean fleet 
composed an order commending 
his men warmly for their per- 
formance in an unrehearsed firing- 
driH. Their target had been — so 
the order said — a new type of 
guided missile recently developed 
by hush-hush agencies of the De- 
fense Department. The admiral 
was pleased and proud, and 
happy. . . . 

It was an excellent order, but 
it wasn't true. The admiral wasn't 
happy. Not after battle photo- 
graphs were developed and he 
could see how the alien ship had 
dodged rockets with perfect ease, 
and had actually taken a fi ve- 
inch shell, which exploded on 
impact, without a particle of 
damage. 

On the carrier, the Greek gen- 
eral said mildly to Coburn that 
the Invaders had used their power 
very strangely. After stopping 
an invasion of Greece, they had 
prevented an atomic-bomb ex- 
plosion which would have killed 



THE INVADERS 



149 



some hundreds of thousands of 
people. And it was strange that 
the turtle-shaped ship that had 
attacked the air transport was so 
clumsily handled as compared 
with this similar craft which had 
zestfully dodged all the missiles a 
fleet could throw at it. 

Coburn thought hard. "I think 
I see," he said slowly. " You 
mean, they're here and they know 
all they need to know. But instead 
of com tug ou t in to the open , 
they're making governments rec- 
ognize their existence. They're 
letting the rulers of Earth know 
they can't he resisted. But we did 
knock off one of their ships last 
night ! " 

The Greek general pointedly 
said nothing. Coburn caught his 
meaning'. The fleet, firing point- 
blank, had not destroyed its tar- 
get. The ship last night had seemed 
to fall into a cloud bank and ex- 
plode. But nobody had seen it 
blow up. Maybe it hadn't. 

"Humoring us!" realized Co- 
burn. "They don't want to de- 
stroy our civilization, so they'll 
humor us. But they want our 
governments to know that they 
can do as they please. If our gov- 
ernments know we can't resist, 
they think we'll surrender. But 
they're wrong." 

The Greek general looked at 
him enigmatically. 

"We've still got one trick left," 
said Coburn. "Atomic bombs. 
And if they fail, we can still get 



killed fighting them another way." 

There was a heavy, droning 
noise far away. It increased and 
drew nearer. It was a multi- 
engined plane which came from 
the west and settled down, and 
hovered over the water and 
touched and instantly created a 
spreading wake of foam. 

The fleet was back at anchor 
then. It was enclosed in the most 
beautiful combination of city and 
scene that exists anywhere. Be- 
yond the city the blunted cone of 
Vesuvius rose. In the city, news- 
paper vendors shrilly hawked de- 
nunciations of the American ships 
because of the danger that their 
atom bombs might explode. Well 
outside the harbor, a Navy crew 
of experts worked to make quite- 
impossible the detonation of 
atomic bombs in a stubby tramp- 
steamer which had — plausibly, 
at least — been sent to make 
those same newspapers' prophe- 
cies of disaster come true. 

A long, long time passed, while 
consultations took place to which 
Coburn was not invited. Then a 
messenger led him to the ward- 
room of the previous conference. 
He recognized the men who had 
landed by seaplane a while since. 
One was a cabinet member from 
Washington. There was someone 
of at least equal importance from 
London, picked up en route. There 
were generals and admirals. The 
service officers looked at Coburn 



L50 



 



with something like accusation in 
their eyes. He was the means by 
which they had come to realize 
their impotence. The Greek gen- 
eral sat quietly in the rear. 

"Mr. Coburn," said the Sec- 
retary from Washington, "We've 
been canvassing the situation. It 
seems that we simply are not pre- 
pared to offer effective resistance 

— not yet — - to the . . . invad- 
ers you tell us about. We know of 
no reason why this entire fleet 
could not have been disabled as 
effectively as the tramp-steamer 
offshore. You know about that 
ship?" 

Coburn nodded. The Greek 
general had told him. The Secre- 
tary went on painfully: "Now, 
the phenomena we have to as- 
cribe to Invaders fall into two 
categories. One is the category of 
their action against the Bulgarian 
raiding force, and today the pre- 
vention of the cold-war murder of 
some hundreds of thousands of 
people. That category suggests 
that they are prepared — on terms 

— to be amiable. A point in their 
favor." 

Coburn set his Hps. 

"The other group of events 
simply points you out and builds 
you up as a person of importance 
to these Invaders. You seem to be 
extremely important to them. 
They doubtless could have killed 
you. They did not. What they did 
do was bring you forward to offi- 
cial attention. Presumably they 



had a realistic motive in this. ' ' 

"I don't know what it could 
be,"" said Coburn coldly. " I 
blundered into one affair. I figured 
out a way to detect them. I hap- 
pened to be the means by which 
they were proved to exist. That's 
all. It was an accident." 

The Secretary looked skeptical. 
"Your discoveries were remark- 
ably . . . apt. And it does seem 
clear that they made the appear- 
ance of hunting you, while going 
to some pains not to catch you. 
Mr. Coburn, how can we make 
contact with them?" 

Coburn wanted to swear furi- 
ously. He was still being con- 
sidered a traitor. Only they were 
trying to make use of his treason. 

"I have no idea," he said 
grimly. 

"What do they want?" 

" I would say — Earth," he 
said grimly. 

' ' You deny that you are an 
authorized intermediary for 
them?" 

' ' Absolutely," said Coburn. 
There was silence. The Greek 
general spoke mildly from the 
back of the room. He said in his 
difficult English that Coburn's 
personal motives did not matter. 
But if the Invaders had picked 
him out as especially important, 
it was possible that they felt him 
especially qualified to talk to 
them. The question was, would he 
try to make contact with them? 

The Secretary looked pained, 



THE INVADERS 



151 



but he turned to Coburn. "Mr. 
Coburn?" 

Coburn said, " I've no idea how 
to set about it, but I'll try on one 
condition. There's one thing we 
haven't tried against them. Set 
up an aLom-bomb booby-trap, and 
I'll sit on it. If they try to contact 
me, you can either listen in or try 
to blow them up, and me with 
them !" 

There was buzzing comment. 
Perhaps — Coburn's nails bit into 
his palms when this was suggested 
— perhaps this was a proposal to 
let the Invaders examine an 
atomic bomb, American-style. It 
was said in earnest simplicity. 
But somebody pointed out that a 
race which could travel between 
the stars and had ships such as 
the Mediterranean fleet had tried 
to shoot down, would probably 
find American atomic bombs 
rather primitive. Still — 

The Greek general again spoke 
mildly. If the Invaders were to be 
made to realize that Coburn was 
trying to contact them, he should 
return to Greece. He should visi- 
bly take up residence where he 
could be approached. He should, 
in fact, put himself completely 
at the mercy of the Invaders. 

"Ostensibly," agreed the Sec- 
retary. 

The Greek general then said 
diffidently that he had a small 
villa some twenty miles from the 
suburbs of Salonika. The prevail- 



ing winds were such that if an 
atomic explosion occurred there, 
it would not endanger anybody. 
He offered it. 

"I'll live there," asked Coburn 
coldly, ' ' and wait for them to 
come to me? I'll have microphones 
all about so that every word that's 
said will be relayed to your re- 
corders? And there'll be a bomb 
somewhere about that you can set 
off by remote control? Is that the 
idea?" 

Then Janice spoke up. And Co- 
burn flared into anger against her. 
But she was firm. Coburn saw the 
Greek general smiling slyly. 

They left the conference while 
the decision was made. And they 
were in private, and Janice talked 
to him. There are methods of ar- 
gument against which a man is 
hopeless. She used them. She 
said that she, not Coburn, might 
be the person the Invaders might 
have wanted to take out of circu- 
lation, because she might have 
noticed something important she 
hadn't realized yet. When Coburn 
pointed out that he'd be living 
over an atomic bomb, triggered to 
be set off from a hundred miles 
away, she demanded fiercely to 
know if he realized how she'd feel 
if she weren't there to. . . . 

Next day an aircraft carrier 
put out of Naples with an escort 
of destroyers. It traveled at full 
speed down the toe of Italy's 
boot, through the straits of Mes- 
sina, across the Adriatic, and 



152 



 



rounded the end of Greece and 
went streaking night and day for 
Salonika. Special technicians sent 
by plane beat her time by days. 
The Greek general was there well 
ahead. And he expansively super- 
vised while his inherited, isolated 
vilka was prepared for the recep- 
tion of Invaders — and Coburn 
and Janice. 

And Coburn and Janice were 
married. It was an impressive 
wedding, because it was desirable 
for the Invaders to know about it. 
It was brilliantly military with 
uniforms and glittering decora- 
tions and innumerable important 
people whom neither of them 
knew or cared about. 

It it had been anybody else's 
wedding Coburn would have 
found it unspeakably dreary. The 
only person present whom he 
knew beside Janice was Hallen. 
He acted as groomsman, with the 
air of someone walking on eggs. 
After it was over he shook hands 
with a manner of tremendous re- 
lief. 

" Maybe I'll brag about this 
some day," he told Coburn un- 
easily. "But right now I'm scared 
to death. What do you two really 
expect to happen?" 

Janice smiled at him. "Why," 
she said, "we expect to live hap- 
pily ever after." 

"Oh yes," said Hallen uncom- 
fortably. "But that wasn't just 
what I had in mind." 



VII 

The world wagged on. The 
newspapers knew nothing about 
super-secret top-level worries. 
There was not a single newsstory 
printed anywhere suggesting an 
invasion of Earth from outer 
space. There were a few more 
Flying Saucer yarns than normal, 
and it was beginning to transpire 
that an unusual number of im- 
portant people were sick, or on 
vacation, or otherwise out of con- 
tact with the world. But, actually, 
not one of the events in which Co- 
burn and Janice had been con- 
cerned reached the state of being 
news. Even the shooting off the 
Bay of Naples was explained as 
an emergency drill. 

Quietly, a good many things 
happened. Cryptic orders passed 
around, and oxygen tanks were 
accumulated in military posts. 
Hunter and Mereid guided mis- 
siles were set up as standard equip- 
ment in a number of brand-new 
places. They were loaded for bear. 
-But days went by, and nothing 
happened. Nothing at all. But 
officialdom was not at ease. 

I f anything — - while the wide 
world went happily about its 
business — - really high-level offi- 
cialdom grew more unhappy day 
by day. Coburn and Janice flew 
back to Salonika. They went in 
a Navy plane with a fighter plane 
escort. They landed at the Salon- 
ika airport, and the Greek general 



THE INVADERS 



153 



was among those who greeted 
them . 

He took them out to the villa 
he'd placed at the disposal of 
high authority for their use. He 
displayed it proudly. There was 
absolutely no sign that it had 
been touched by anybody since 
its original builders had finished 
with it two-hundred-odd years 
before. The American officer who 
had wired it, though — he looked 
as if he were short a week's sleep 
— showed them how anywhere on 
the grounds or in the house they 
would need only to speak a code- 
word and they'd instantly be 
answered. 

There were servants, and the 
Greek general took Coburn aside 
and assured him that there was 
one room which absolutely was 
not wired for sound. He named it. 

So they took up a relatively 
normal way of life. Sometimes 
they decided that it would be 
pleasant to drive in to Salonika. 
They mentioned it, and went out 
and got in the car that went with 
the villa. Oddly, there was always 
some aircraft lazying about over- 
head by the time they were out of 
the gate. They always returned 
before sunset. And sometimes they 
swam in the water before the 
villa's door. Then, also, they were 
careful to be back on solid ground 
before sunset. That was so their 
guards out on the water wouldn't 
have to worry. 

But it was a nagging and an un- 



happy business to know that they 
were watched and overheard ev- 
erywhere save in that one unwired 
room. It could have made for ten- 
sion between them. But there was 
another thought to hold them 
together. This was the knowledge 
that they were literally living on 
top of a bomb. If an Invader's 
flying ship descended at the villa, 
everything that happened would 
be heard and seen by microphones 
and concealed television cameras. 
If the Invaders were too arrogant, 
or if they were arbitrary, there 
would be a test to see if their ship 
could exist in the heart of an atom- 
bomb explosion. 

Coburn and Janice, then, were 
happy after a fashion. But no- 
body could call their situation 
restful. 

They had very few visitors. 
The Greek general came out me- 
ticulously every day. Hallen came 
out once, but he knew about the 
atomic bomb. He didn't stay long. 
When they'd been in residence a 
week, the General telephoned 
zestfully that he was going to 
bring out some company. His 
English was so mangled and ob- 
scure that Coburn wondered cyni- 
cally if whoever listened to their 
tapped telephone could under- 
stand him. But, said the General 
in high good humor, he was play- 
ing a good joke. He had hunted 
up Helena, who was Coburn's 
secretary, and he had also invited 



154 



 



Dillon to pay a visit to some 
charming people he knew. Tt 
would be a great joke to see Dil- 
lon's face. 

There was a fire in the living 
room that night. The Greek serv- 
ants had made it, and Coburn 
thought grimly that they were 
braver men and women than he'd 
have been. They didn't have to 
risk their lives. They could have 
refused this particular secret- 
service assignment. But they 
hadn't. 

A voice spoke from the living- 
room ceiling, a clipped American 
voice. " Mr. Coburn, a car is 
coming." 

That was standard. When the 
General arrived; when the occa- 
sional delivery of telephoned-for 
supplies came; on the one occa- 
sion when a peddler on foot had 
entered the ground. It lacked 
something of being the perfect 
atmosphere for a honeymoon, but 
it was the way things were. 

Presently there were headlights 
outside. The Greek butler went to 
greet the guests. Coburn and 
Janice heard voices. The General 
was in uproarious good humor. 
He came in babbling completely 
uncomprehensible Knglish. 

There was Helena. She smiled 
warmly at Coburn. She went at 
once to Janice. "How dp you 
do?" she said in her prettily ac- 
cented English. "I have missed 
not working for your husband, but 
this is my fiance!" 



And Janice shook hands with a 
slick-haired young Greek who 
looked pleasant enough, but did 
not seem to her as remarkable as 
Coburn. 

Then Dillon stared at Coburn. 

"The devil ! " he said, with every 
evidence of indignation. "This is 
the chap — " 

The General roared, and Co- 
burn said awkwardly: "I owe you 
an apology, and the privilege of a 
poke in the nose besides. But it 
was a situation — I was in a 
state — " 

Then the General howled with 
laughter. Helena laughed. Her 
fiance laughed. And Dillon grinned 
amusedly at Coburn. 

"My dear fellow!" said Dillon. 
"We are the guests this whole 
villa was set up to receive! The 
last time I saw you was in Naousa, 
and the last time Helena saw you 
you stuck pins in her, and — " 

Coburn stiffened. He went 
slowly pale. 

"I — see! You're the foam-suit 
people, eh?" Then he looked with 
hot passion at the General. 
"You!" he said grimly. "You I 
didn't suspect. You've made fools 
of all of us, I think." 

The General said something ob- 
scure which could have been a 
proverb. It was to the effect that 
nobody could tell a fat man was 
cross-eyed when he laughed. 

" Yes," said Dillon beaming. 
"He is fat. So his eyes don't look 



THE INVADERS 



155 



like they're different. You have to 
see past his cheeks and eyebrows. 
That's how he passed muster. 
And he slept very soundly after 
the airport affair." 

Cob urn felt a sort of sick hor- 
ror. The General had passed as a 
man, and he'd loaned this villa, 
and he knew all about the in- 
stallation of the atomic bomb. 
. . . Then Coburn looked through 
a doorway and there was his 
Greek butler standing in readiness 
with a submachine-gun in his 
hands. 

" 1 take it this is an official 
call," said Coburn steadily. "In 
that case you know we're over- 
heard — or did the General can- 
cel that?" 

"Oh, yes!" said Dillon. "We 
know all about the trap we've 
walked into. But we'd decided 
that the time had come to appear 
in the open anyhow. You peopte 
are very much like us, inciden- 
tally. Apparently there's only 
one real way that a truly rational 
brain can work. And we and you 
Earth people both have it. May 
we sit down? " 

Janice said: "By all means!" 

Helena sat, with an absolutely 
human gesture of spreading her 
skirt beside her. The General 
plumped into a chair and chuc- 
kled. The slick-haired young man 
politely offered Janice a cigarette 
and lighted Helena's for her. 
Dillon leaned against the mantel 
above the fire. 



"Well?" said Coburn harshly. 
"You can state your terms. What 
do you want and what do you 
propose to do to get it?" 

Dillon shook his head. He took 
a deep breath. "1 want yon to 
listen, Coburn. I know about the 
atom bom b plan ted somcw 1 1 c re 
around, and I know I'm talking 
for my life. You know we aren't 
natives of Earth. You've guessed 
that we come from a long way off. 
We do. Now — we found out the 
trick of space travel some time 
ago. You're quite welcome to it. 
We found it, and we started ex- 
ploring. We've been in space, 
you might say, just about two of 
your centuries. You're the only 
other civilized race we've found. 
That's point one." 

Coburn fumbled in his pocket. 
He found a cigarette. Dillon held 
a match. Coburn started, and then 
accepted it. 

"Go on." He added, "There's a 
television camera relaying this, 
by the way. Did you know? " 

" Yes, I know," said Dillon. 
" Now, having about two cen- 
turies the start of you, we have a 
few tricks you haven't found out 
yet. For one thing, we understand 
ourselves, and you, better than 
you do. We've some technical 
gadgets you haven't happened on 
yet. However, it's entirely possi- 
ble for you to easily kill the four 
of us here tonight. If you do — 
you do. But there are others of 
our race here. That's point two." 



150 



 



" Now come the threats and de- 
mands," said Coburn. 

"Perhaps." But Dillon seemed 
to hesitate. " Dam mi t, Coburn, 
you're a reasonable man. Try to 
think like us a moment. What 
would you do if you'd started to 
explore spare and came upon a 
civilized race, as we have?" 

( 'oburn said formidably, "We'd 
study ihem and try to make 
friends." 

" In that order," said Dillon 
instantly. "That's what we've 
tried to do. We disguised our- 
selves as you because we wanted 
to learn how to make friends be- 
fore we tried. But what did we 



find. Coburn? What's your guess?" 

"You name it!" said Coburn. 

"You Earth people," said Dil- 
lon, "are at a turning-point in 
your history. Either you solve 
your problems and keep on climb- 
ing, or you'll blast your civiliza- 
tion down to somewhere near a 
caveman level and have to start 
all over again. You know what I 
mean. Our two more spectacular 
interferences dealt with it." 

"The Iron Curtain," said Co- 
burn. "Yes. But what's that got 
to do with you? It's none of your 
business. That's ours." 

"But it is ours," said Dillon 




urgently. "Don't you see, Co- 
bum? You've a civilization nearly 
as advanced as ours. If we can 
make friends, we can do each 
other an infinite lot of good. We 
can complement each other. We 

can have a inosL valuable trade, 
not only in goods, but in what you 
call human values and we call 
something else. We'd like to start 
that trade. 

"But you're desperately close 
to smashing things. So we've had 
to rush things. We did stop that 
Bulgarian raid. When you proved 
too sharp to be fooled, we grew 
hopeful. Here might be our enter- 
ing wedge. We hammered at you. 
We managed to make your people 
suspicious that there might be 
something in what you said. We 
proved it. It was rugged for you, 
but we had to let you people force 
us into the open, if we'd marched 
out shyly with roses in our hair — 
what would you have thought?" 

Coburn said doggedly: " I'm 
still waiting for the terms. What 
do you want? " 

The General said something 
plaintive from his chair. It was to 
the effect that Coburn still be- 
lieved that Earth was in danger of 
conquest from space. 

"Look!" said Dillon irritably. 
" If you people had found the trick 
of space travel first, and you'd 
found us, would you have tried to 
conquer us? Considering that 
we're civilized?" 

Coburn said coldly, "No. Not 



my particular people. We know 
you can' i conquer a civilized race. 
You can exterminate them, or 
you can break I hem down to 
savagery, but you can't conquer 
them. You can't conquer us!" 

Then I )illon said very pain* 
stakingly: " But we don't want to 
conquer you. Even your friends 
inside the Iron Curtain know that 
the only way to conquer a country 
is to smash it down to savagery. 
They've done that over and over 
for conquest. But what the devil 
good would savages be to us? We 
want someone to trade with. We 
can't trade with savages. We want 
someone to gain something from. 
What have savages lo oiler us? 
A planet ? Good Heavens, man ! 
We've already found sixty planets 
for colonies, much belter for us 
than Earth. Your gravity here is 
. . . well, it's sickeningly low." 

"What do you want then?" 

"We want to be friends," said 
Dillon. "We'll gain by it exactly 
what you Earth people gained 
when you traded freely among 
yourselves, before blocked cur- 
rencies and quotas and such non- 
sense strangled trade. We'll gain 
what you gained when you'd 
stopped having every city a fort 
and every village guarded by the 
castle of its lord. Look, Coburn; 
we've got people inside the Iron 
Curtain. We'll keep them there. 
You won't he able to disband your 
armies, but we can promise you 
won't have to use them — be- 



158 



AMAZING stouiks 



cause we certainly won't help you 
chaps fight among yourselves. 
We'll give you one of our ships to 
study and work on. But we won't 
give you our arms. You'll have 
your moon in a year and your 
whole solar system in a decade. 
You'll trade with us from the time 
you choose, and you'll be roaming 
space when you can grasp the 
trick of it. Man, you can't refuse. 
You're too near to certain smash- 
ing of your civilization, and we 
can help you to avoid it. Think 
what we're offering." 

Then Coburn said grimly: "And 
if we don't like the bargain? What 
if we refuse?" 

Dillon carefully put the ash 
from his cigarette into an ashtray. 
"If you won't be our friends," he 
said with some distaste, "we can't 
gain anything useful from you. 
We don't want you as slaves. 
You'd be no good to us. For that 
reason we can't get anything we 
want from the Iron Curtain peo- 
ple. They've nothing to offer 
that we can use. So our ultimatum 
is — make friends or we go away 
and leave you alone. Take it or 
leave it!" 

There was a dead, absolute 
silence. After a long time Coburn 
said : " Altruism?" 

Dillon grinned. "Enlightened 
self-interest. Common sense!" 

There was a clicking in the ceil- 
ing. A metallic voice said: "Mr. 
Coburn, the conversation just 



overheard and recorded has to be 
discussed in detail on high dip- 
lomatic levels. Jt will take time 
for conferences — decisions — ar- 
rangements. Assuming that your* 
guests are acting in good faith, 
they have safe conduct from the 
villa. Their offer is very attractive, 
but it will have to be passed on at 
high policy-making levels." 

Dillon said pleasantly, to the 
ceiling: "Yes. And you've got to 
feeep it from being public, of 
course, until your space ships can 
discover us somewhere. It will 
have to be handled diplomatically, 
so your people are back of a grand 
offer to make friends when it 
happens." He added wryly," We're 
very much alike, really. Coburn's 
very much like us. That's why 
if it's all right with you — you 
can arrange for him to be our 
point of confidential contact. We'll 
keep in touch with him." 

The ceiling did not reply. Dillon 
waited, then shrugged. The Greek 
general spoke. He said that since 
they had come so far out from 
Salonika, it was too early to leave 
again. It might be a good idea to 
have a party. Some music would 
be an excellent thing. He said he 
liked Earth music very much. 

A long time later Janice and 
Coburn were alone in the one room 
of the house which was not wired 
for sound. There were no micro- 
phones here. 

Coburn said reluctantly in the

darkness: "It sounds sensible all 
right. Maybe it's true. But it feels 
queer to think of it. . . ." 

Janice pressed closer to him and 
whispered in his ear: "I made 
friends with that girl who passed 
for Helena. I like her. She says 
we'll be invited to make a trip to 
their planet. They can do some- 
thing about the gravity. And she 
says she's really going to be mar- 
ried to the . . . person who was 



with her. . . ." She hesitated. 
"She showed me what they really 
look like when they're not dis- 
guised as us." 

Coburn put hts arm around her 
and smiled gently. "Well? Want 
to tell me?" 

Janice caught her breath. " I — 
I could have cried. . . . The poor 
thing — to look like that. I'm 
glad I look like I do. For you, 
darling. For you."
