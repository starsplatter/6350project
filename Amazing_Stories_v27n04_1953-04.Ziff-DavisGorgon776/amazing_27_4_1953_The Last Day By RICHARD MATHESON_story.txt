The Last Day By RICHARD MATHESON 





He woke up and the first thing he thought was: the last night is gone. 

He had slept through half of it. 

He lay there on the floor and looked up at the ceiling. 
The walls still glowed reddish from the outside light. 
There was no sound in the living room but that of 
snoring. 

He looked around. There were bodies sprawled all 
over the room. On the couch, slumped on chairs, curled 
up on the floor. 

He raised up on one elbow and winced at the shoot- 
ing pains in his head. He closed his eyes and held them 



93 



tightly shut for a moment. Then 
he opened them again. He ran his 
tongue over the inside of his dry 
mouth. There was stilt a stale 
taste of liquor and food in his 
mouth. 

He rested on his elbow as he 
looked around the room again , 
his mind slowly registering the 
scene. 

Nancy and Bill lying in each 
other's arms, both naked. Nor- 
man curled up in an arm chair, his 
thin face taut as he slept. Mort 
and Mel lying on the floor, cov- 
ered with dirty throw rugs. Both 
snoring. Others on the floor. 

Outside the red glow. 

He looked at the window and 
his throat moved. He blinked. He 
looked down over his long body. 
He swallowed again. 

I'm alive, he thought, and it's 
all true. 

He rubbed his eyes. He took a 
deep breath of the dead air in the 
apartment. 

He knocked over a glass as he 
struggled to his feet. The liquor 
and soda sloshed over the rug and 
soaked into the dark blue weave. 

He looked around at the other 
glasses, broken, kicked over, 
hurled against the wall. He looked 
at the bottles all over, all empty. 

He stood staring around the 
room. He looked at the record 
player overturned, the albums all 
strewn around, jagged pieces of 
records in crazy patterns on the 
rug. 



He remembered. 

It was Mort who had started 
it the night before. Mort who had 
suddenly rushed to the playing 
record machine and shouted 
drunkenly, "What the hell is 
music any more! Just a lot of 
noise! " 

And he had driven the point of 
his shoe against the front of the 
record player and knocked it 
against the wall. He had lurched 
over and down on his knees. He 
had struggled up with the player 
in his beefy arms and heaved the 
entire thing over on its back and 
kicked it again. 

"The hell with music!" Mort 
had yelled. ' ' I hate the crap 
anyway! " 

Then he'd started to drag rec- 
ords out of their albums and their 
envelopes and snap them over his 
kneecap. 

"Come on!" he'd yelled to 
everybody. "Come on!" 

And it had caught on. The way 
all crazy ideas had caught on in 
those last few days. 

Mel had jumped up from mak- 
ing love to a girl. He had flung 
records out the windows, scaling 
them far across the street. And 
Charlie had put aside his gun for 
a moment to stand at the windows 
too and try to hit people in the 
street with the records. 

Richard had watched the dark 
saucers bounce and shatter on the 
sidewalks below. He'd even thrown 
one himself. Then he'd just turned 



94 



 



away and let the others rage. He'd 
taken Mel's girl into the bedroom 
and for a few moments they forgot 
what was happening to their 
world. 

He thought about that as he 
stood waveringly in the reddish 
light of the room 

He closed his eyes a moment. 

Then he looked at Nancy and 
remembered taking her too some- 
time in the jumble of wild hours 
that had been yesterday and last 
night. 

She looked vile now, he thought. 
She'd always been an animal. Be- 
fore, though, she'd had to veil it. 
Now, in the final twilight of 
everything, she could revei in the 
only thing she'd ever really cared 
about. 

He wondered if there were any 
people left in the world with real 
dignity. The kind that was still 
there when it no longer was 
necessary to impress people with it. 

He stepped over the body of a 
sleeping girl. She had on only a 
si ip. He looked down at her 
tangled hair, at her smeared red 
lips, at the tight, unhappy frown 
printed on her face. 

He glanced into the bedroom as 
he passed it. There were three 
girls and two men in the bed. 

He found the body in the bath- 
room. 

It was thrown carelessly in the 
tub and the shower curtain torn 
down to cover it. Only the legs 



showed, dangling ridiculously over 
the front rim of the tub. 

He drew back the curtain and 
looked at the blood-soaked shirt, 
at the white, still face. 

Charlie. 

He shook his head, then turned 
away and washed his face and 
hands at the sink. It didn't mat- 
ter. Nothing mattered. As a mat- 
ter of fact, Charlie was one of the 
lucky ones now. A member of the 
legion who had put their heads 
into ovens, or cut their wrists or 
taken pills or done away with 
themselves in the accepted fash- 
ions of suicide. 

As he looked at his tired face in 
the mirror he thought of cutting 
his wrists. But he knew he 
couldn't. Because it took more 
than just despair to incite self- 
destruction. 

He took a drink of water. 
Lucky, he thought, there's still 
water running. He didn't suppose 
there was a sou! left to run the 
water system. Or the electric sys- 
tem or the gas system or the tele- 
phone system or any system for 
that matter. 

What fool would work on the 
last day of the world? 

Spencer was in the kitchen 
when Richard went in. 

He was sitting in his shorts at 
the table looking at his hands. On 
the stove some eggs were frying. 
The gas must still be working 
then too, Richard thought. 



THE LAST DAY 



95 



"Hello," he said to Spencer. 

Spencer grunted without look- 
ing up. He stared at his hands. 
Richard let it go. He turned the 
gas down a little. He took bread 
out of the cupboard and put it 
in the electric toaster. But the 
toaster didn't work. He shrugged 
and forgot about it. 

"What time is it?" Spencer was 
looking at him with the question. 
- Richard looked at his watch. 
"It stopped," he said. 

They looked at each other. 

"Oh," Spencer said. Then he 
asked, "What day is it?" 

Richard thought. "Sunday, I 
think," he said. 

" I wonder if people are at 
church," Spencer said. 

"Who cares?" 

Richard opened the refriger- 
ator. 

"There aren't any more eggs," 
Spencer said. 

Richard shut the door. "No 
more eggs," he said dully, "No 
more chickens. No more any- 
thing." 

He leaned against the wall with 
a shuddering breath and looked 
out the window at the red sky. 
. Mary, he thought. Mary, who 
I should have married. Who I let 
go. He wondered where she was. 
He wondered if she were thinking 
about him at all. 

Norman came trudging in, 
groggy with sleep and hangover. 
His mouth hung open. He looked 
dazed. 



"Morning," he slurred. 

"Good morning, merry 'Sun- 
shine,' ' Richard said , wi thou t 
mirth. 

Norman looked at him blankly. 
Then he went over to the sink and 
washed out his mouth. He spit the 
water down the drain. 

"Charlie's dead," he said. 

"I know," Richard said. 

"Oh. When did it happen?" 

"Last night," Richard told him. 
"You were unconscious. You re- 
member how he kept saying he 
was going to shoot us all? Put us 
out of our misery?" 

"Yeah," Norman said. " He put 
the muzzle against my head. He 
said feel how cool it is." 

"Well, he got in a fight with 
Mort," Richard said. "The gun 
went off." He shrugged. "That 
was it." 

They looked at each other with- 
out expression. 

Then Norman turned his head 
and looked out the window. "It's 
still up there," he muttered. 

They looked up at the great 
flaming ball in the sky that crowded 
out the sun, the moon, the stars. 

Norman turned away, his throat 
moving. His lips trembled and he 
clamped them together. "Jesus," 
he said. "It's today." 

He looked up at the sky again. 
"Today," he repeated. "Every- 
/Atwg." 

"Everything," said Richard. 
Spencer got up and turned off 
the gas. He looked down at the 



96 



AMAZING STOKIES 



eggs for a moment. Then he said, 
"What the hell did I fry these 
for?" 

He dumped them into the sink 
and they slid greasily over the 
white surface. The yolks burst and 
spurted smoking, yellow fluid over 
the enamel. 

Spencer bit his lips. His face 
grew hard. "I'm taking her again," 
he said suddenly. 

He pushed past Richard and 
dropped his shorts off as he turned 
the corner into the hallway. 

"There goes Spencer," Richard 
said. 

Norman sat down at the table. 
Richard stayed at the wall. 

In the living room they heard 
Nancy suddenly call out at the 
top of her strident voice: "Hey, 
wake up, everybody! Watch me 
do it! Watch me, everybody, 
watch mel ' ' 

Norman looked at the kitchen 
doorway for a moment/ Then 
something gave inside of him and 
he slumped his head forward on 
his arms on the table. His thin 
shoulders shook. 

"I did it too," he said brokenly. 
"I did it too. Oh God, what did 
I come here for?" 

"Sex," Richard said. "Like all 
the rest of us. You thought you 
could end your life in carnal, 
drunken bliss." 

Norman's voice was muffled. 
" I can't die like that," he sobbed. 
"I can't." 



"A couple of billion people are 
doing it," Richard said. "When 
the sun hits us, they'll still be at 
it. What a sight." 

The thought of a world's people 
indulging themselves in one last 
orgy of animalism made him shud- 
der. He closed his eyes and pressed 
his forehead against the wall and 
tried to forget. 

But the wall was warm. 

Norman looked up from the 
table. "Let's go home," he said. 

Richard looked at him. 
"Home?" he said. 

"To our parents. My mother 
and father. Your mother." 

Richard shook his head. ' ' I 
don't want to," he said. 

" But I can't go alone." 

"Why?" 

"Because ... I can't. You 
know how the streets arc full of 
guys just killing everybody they 
meet." 

Richard shrugged. 

"Why won't you? " Norman 
asked. 

" I don't want to see her." 
"Your mother?" 
"Yes." 

"You're crazy," Norman said. 
"Who else is there to . . ." 
"No." 

He thought of his mother at 
home waiting for him. Waiting for 
him on the last day. And it made 
him ill to think of delaying, of 
maybe never seeing her again. 

But he kept thinking: how can 
1 go home and have her try to 



THE LAST DAY 



97 



make me pray? Try to make me 
read from the Bible, spend these 
last hours in a muddle of religious 
absorption ? 

He said it again for himself. 
"No." 

Norman looked lost. His chest 
shook with a swallowed sob. "I 
want to see my mother," he said. 

"Go ahead," Richard said 
casually. 

But his insidcs were twisting 
themselves into knots. To never 
see her again. Or his sister and her 
husband and her daughter. 

Never to see any of them again. 

He sighed. It was no use fight- 
ing it. In spite of everything, 
Norman was right. Who else was 
there in the world to turn to? In 
a wide world about to be burned, 
was there any other person who 
loved him above all others? 

"Oh ... all right," he said. 
"Come on. Anything to get out 
of this place." 

The apartment house hall 
smelted of vomit. They found the 
janitor dead drunk on the stairs. 
They found a dog in the foyer 
with its head kicked in. 
- They stopped as they came out 
the entrance of the building. 

Instinctively, they looked up. 

At the red sky, like molten slag. 
At the fiery wisps that fell like 
hot rain drops through the atmos- 
phere. At the gigantic ball of flame 
that kept coming closer and closer, 
that blotted out the universe. 



They lowered their watering 
eyes. It hurt to look. They started 
walking along the street. It was 
very warm, 

"December," Richard said. 
"It's like the tropics." 

As they walked along in silence 
he thought of the tropics, of the 
poles, of all the world's countries 
he would never see. Of all the 
things he would never do. 

Like hold Mary in his arms and 
tell her, as the world was ending, 
that he loved her very much and 
was not afraid. 

"Never" he said, feeling himself 
go rigid with frustration. 

"What?" Norman said. 

"Nothing. Nothing." 

As they walked Richard felt 
something heavy in his jacket 
pocket. It bumped against his side. 
He reached in and drew out the 
object. 

"What's that?" Norman asked. 

"Charlie's gun," Richard said. 
" I took it last night so nobody else 
would get hurt." 

His laughter was harsh. "So 
nobody else would get hurt," he 
said bitterly. "Jesus, I ought to 
be on the stage." 

He was about to throw it away 
when he changed bis mind. He 
slid it back into his pocket. 

" I may need it," he said. 

Norman wasn't listening. 
"Thank God nobody stole my 
car. Oh—!" 

Somebody had thrown a rock 
through the windshield. 



98 



 



"What's the difference?" Rich- 
ard said. 

"I . . . none, I suppose." 

They got into the front seat 
and brushed the glass off the 
cushion. It was stuffy in the car. 
Richard pulled off his jacket and 
threw it out. He put the gun in 
his side pants pocket. 

As Norman drove downtown 
they passed people in the street. 

Some were running around 
wildly, as if they were searching 
for something. Others were fight- 
ing. Strewn all over the sidewalks 
were bodies of people who had 
leaped from windows and been 
struck down by speeding cars. 
Buildings were on fire, windows 
shattered from the explosions of 
unlit gas jets. 

There were people looting stores. 

" What's the matter with them? " 
Norman asked miserably. " Is that 
how they want to spend rheir last 
day?" 

"Maybe that's how they spent 
their whole life, ' ' R ichard an- 
swered. 

He leaned against the door and 
gazed at the people they passed. 
Some of them waved at him. Some 
cursed and spat. A few threw 
things at the speeding car. 

" People die the way they lived," 
he said. "Some good, some bad." 

"Look out!" Norman cried out 
as a car came careening down the 
street on the wrong side. Men and 
women hung out of the window 



shouting and singing and waving 
bottles. 

Norman twisted the wheel vio- 
lently and they missed the car by 
inches. 

"Are they crazy?" he said. 

Richard looked out through the 
back window. He saw the car skid, 
saw it get out of control and go 
crashing into a store front and 
turn over on its side, the wheels 
spinning crazily. 

He turned back without speak- 
ing. Norman kept looking ahead 
grimly, his hands on the wheel, 
white and tense. 

Another intersection. 

A car came speeding across their 
path. Norman jammed on the 
brakes with a gasp. They crashed 
against the dashboard, getting 
their breath knocked out. 

Then, before Norman could get 
the car started again, a gang of 
teen-age boys with knives and 
clubs came dashing into the inter- 
section. They'd been chasing the 
other car. Now they changed 
direction and flung themselves at 
the car that held Norman and 
Richard. 

Norman threw the car into first 
and gunned across the street. 

A boy jumped on the back of 
the car. Another tried for the 
running board, missed and went 
spinning over the street. Another 
jumped on the running board and 
grabbed the door handle. He 
slashed at Richard with a knife. 



THE LAST DAY 



99 



"Gonna kill ya bastids!" yelled 
the boy. " Sonsabitches ! " 

He slashed again and tore open 
the back of the seat as Richard 
jerked his shoulder to the side. 

"Get out of here!" Norman 
screamed, trying to watch the boy 
and the street ahead at the same 
time. 

The boy tried to open the door 
as the car wove wildly down 
Broadway. He slashed again but 
the car's motion made him miss. 

"I'll get ya!" he screamed in a 
fury of brainless hate. 

Richard tried to open the door 
and knock the boy off, but he 
couldn't. The boy's twisted white 
face thrust in through the window. 
He raised his knife. 

Richard had the gun now. He 
shot the boy in the face. 

The boy flung back from the car 
with a dying howl and landed like 
a sack of rocks. He bounced once, 
his left leg kicked and then he lay 
still. 

Richard twisted around. 

The boy on the back was still 
hanging on, his crazed face pressed 
against the back window. Richard 
saw his mouth moving as the boy 
cursed. 

"Shake him off!" he said. 

Norman headed for the side- 
walk, then suddenly veered back 
into the street. The boy hung on. 
Norman did it again. The boy still 
clung to the back. 

Then on the third time he lost 
his grip and went off. He tried to 



run along the street but his mo- 
mentum was too great and he 
went leaping over the curb and 
crashing into a plate glass win- 
dow, arms stuck up in front of 
him to ward off the blow. 

They sat in the car, breathing 
heavily. They didn't talk for a 
long while. Richard flung the gun 
out the window and watched it 
clatter on the concrete and bounce 
off a hydrant. Norman started to 
say something about it, then 
stopped. 

The car turned into Fifth Ave- 
nue and started downtown at 
sixty miles an hour. There weren't 
many cars. 

They passed churches. People 
were packed inside them. They 
overflowed out onto the steps. 

"Poor fools," Richard nuit- 
tered, his hands still shaking. 

Norman took a deep breath. 
"I wish I was a poor fool," he 
said. "A poor fool who could be- 
lieve in something." 

"Maybe," Richard said. Then 
he added, "I'd rather spend the 
last day believing what I think is 
true." 

"The last day," Norman said. 
"I . . ." He shook his head. "I 
can't believe it," he said. "I read 
the papers. I see that . . . that 
thing up there. I know it's going 
to happen. But God! The end?" 

He looked at Richard for a split 
second. "Nothing afterward?" 

Richard said, "I don't know." 

At 14th Street Norman drove 



100 



 



to the East side, then sped across 
the Manhattan Bridge. He didn't 
stop for anything, driving around 
bodies and wrecked cars. Once he 
drove over a body and Richard 
saw his face twitch as the wheel 
rolled over the dead man's leg. 

"They're all lucky," Richard 
said. "Luckier than we are." 

They stopped in front of Nor- 
man's house in Brooklyn. Some 
kids were playing ball in the street. 
They didn't seem to realize what 
was happening. Their shouts 
sounded very loud in the silent 
street. Richard wondered if their 
parents knew where the children 
were. Or cared. 

Norman was looking at him. 
"Well . . .?" he started to say. 

Richard felt his stomach mus- 
cles tightening. He couldn't an- 
swer. 

"Would you . . . like to come 
in. for a minute?" Norman asked. 

Richard shook his head. "No," 
he said- " I better get home. I'. . . 
should see her. My mother, I 
mean." 

"Oh." Norman nodded. Then 
he straightened up. He forced a 
momentary calm over himself. 
"For what it's worth, Dick," he 
said, " I consider you my best 
friend and . . ." 

He faltered. He reached out and 
gripped Richard's hand. Then he 
pushed out of the car, leaving the 
keys in the ignition. 

"So long," he said hurriedly. 

Richard watched his friend run 



around the car and move for the 
apartment house. When he had 
almost reached the door, Richard 
called out: "Norm!" 

Norman stopped and turned. 
The two of them looked at each 
other. All the years they had 
known each other seemed to 
flicker between them. 

Then Richard managed to smile. 
He touched his forehead in a last 
salute. 

"So long, Norm," he said. 

Norman didn't smile. He pushed 
through the door and was gone. 

Richard looked at the door for 
a long time. He started the motor. 
Then he turned it off again think- 
ing that Norman's parents might 
not be home. 

After a while he started it again 
and began the trip home. 

As he drove he kept thinking. 

The closer he got to the end, the 
less he wanted to face it. He 
wanted to end it now. Before the 
hysterics started. 

Sleeping pills, he decided. It was 
the best way. He had some at 
home. He hoped there were enough 
left. There might not be any left 
in the corner drug store. There'd 
been a rush for sleeping pills 
during those last few days. Entire 
families took them together. 

He reached the house without 
event. Overhead the sky was an 
incandescent crimson. He felt the 
heat on his face like waves from a 
distant oven. He breathed in the 



THE LAST DAY 



101 



heated air, his lungs cringing. 

He unlocked the front door and 
walked in slowly. 

I'll probably find her in the 
front room, he thought. Sur- 
rounded by her books, praying, 
exhorting invisible powers to suc- 
cor her as the world prepared to 
fry itself. 

She wasn*t in the front room. 

He searched the house. And, as 
he did, his heart began to beat 
quickly, and when he knew she 
really wasn't there he felt a great 
hollow feeling in his stomach. He 
knew that his talk about not 
wanting to see her had been just 
talk. He loved her. And she was 
the only one left now. 

He searched for a note in her 
room, in his, in the living room. 

** Mom," he said. " Mom, where 
are you? " 

He found the note in the 
kitchen. He picked it up from the 
table: 

Richard darling, 
I'm at your sister's 
house. Please come there. 
Don't make me spend 
the last day without you. 
Don't make me leave this 
world without seeing your 
dear face again. Please. 
The last day. 

There it was in black and white. 
And, of all people, it had been his 
mother to write down the words. 
She who had always been so 
skeptical of his taste for material 
science. Now admitting the reali- 



ty of science's last prediction. 

Because she couldn't doubt any 
more. Because the sky was filled 
with flaming evidence and no one 
could doubt any more. 

The whole world going. The 
staggering detail of evolutions and 
revolutions, of strifes and clashes, 
of endless continuities of centuries 
streaming back into the clouded 
past, of rocks and trees and ani- 
mals and men. All to pass. In a 
flash, in a moment. The pride, the 
vanity of man's world incinerated 
by a freak of astronomical dis- 
order. 

What point was there to all of 
it, then? None, none at all. Be- 
cause it was all ending. 

He got sleeping pills from the 
medicine cabinet and left. He 
drove to his sister's house thinking 
about his mother as he passed 
through the streets littered with 
everything from empty bottles to 
dead people. 

If only he didn't dread the 
thought of arguing with his 
mother on this last day. Of disput- 
ing with her about her God and 
her conviction. 

He made up his mind not to 
argue. He'd force himself to make 
their last day a peaceful one. He 
would accept her simple devotion 
and not hack at her faith any 
more. 

The front door was locked at 
Grace's house. He rang the bell 
and, after a moment, heard hur- 
ried steps inside. 



102 



 



He heard Ray shout inside, 
"Don't open it, Mom! It may be 
that gang again ! " 

"It's Richard, I know it is!" 
his mother called back. 

Then the door was open and she 
was embracing him and crying 
happily. 

He didn't speak at first. Finally 
he said softly, "Hello, Mom." 

His niece Doris played all after- 
noon in the front room while 
Grace and Ray sat motionless in 
the living room looking at her. 

If I were with Mary, Richard 
kept thinking. If only we were 
together today. Then he thought 
that they might have had chil- 
dren. And he would have had to 
sit like Grace and know that the 
few years his child had lived 
would be its only years. 

The sky grew brighter as eve- 
ning approached. It flowed with 
violent crimson currents. Doris 
stood quietly at the window 'and 
looked at it. She hadn't laughed 
all day or cried. And Richard 
thought to himself, she knows. 

And thought too that at any 
moment his mother would ask 
them all to pray together. To sit 
and read the Bible and hope for 
divine charity. 

But she didn't say anything. 
She smiled. She made supper. 
Richard stood with her in the 
kitchen as she made supper. 

"I may not wait," he told her. 
"I . . . may take sleeping pills." 



"Are you afraid, son? " she 
asked. 

"Everybody is afraid," he said. 

She shook her head. " Not 
everybody," she said. 

Now, he thought, it's coming. 
That smug look, the opening line. 

She gave him a dish with the 
vegetable and they all sat down 
to eat. 

During supper none of them 
spoke except to ask for food. 
Doris never spoke once. Richard 
sat looking at her from across the 
table. 

lie thought about the night 
before. The crazy drinking, the 
fighting, the carnal abuses. He 
thought of Charlie dead in the 
bathtub. Of the apartment in 
Manhattan. Of Spencer driving 
himself into a frenzy of lust as the 
climax to his life. Of the boy lying 
dead in the New York gutter with 
a bullet in his brain. 

They all seemed very far away. 
He could almost believe it had all 
never happened. Could almost 
believe that this was just another 
evening meal with his family. 

Except for the cherry glow that 
filled the sky and flooded in 
through the windows like an aura 
from some fantastic fireplace. 

Near the end of the meal Grace 
went and got a box. She sat down 
at the table with it and opened it. 
She took out white pills. Doris 
looked at her, her large eyes 
searching. 



THE LAST DAY 



103 



"This is dessert," Grace told 
her. "We're all going to have 
white candy for dessert." 

" Is it peppermint?" Doris asked 
quietly. 

"Yes," Grace said. "It's pep- 
permint." 

Richard felt his scalp crawling 
as Grace put pills in front of 
Doris. In front of Ray. 

"We haven't enough for all of 
us," she said to Richard. 

"1 have my own," he said. 

"Have you enough for Mom?" 
she asked. 

" I won't need any," her mother 
said. 

In his tenseness Richard almost 
shouted at her. Shouted stop being 
so damned noble! But he held 
himself. He stared in fascinated 
horror at Doris holding the pills in 
her small hand. 

" This isn't peppermint," she 
said. "Momma, this isn't — " 

" Yes it is." Grace took a deep 
breath. "Hat it, darling." 

Doris put one in her mouth. 
She made a face. Then she spit it 
into her palm. "It isn't pepper- 
mint," she said, upset. 

Grace threw up her hand and 
dug her teet h in the white knuckles. 
Her eyes moved frantically to 
Ray. 

" Eat it, Doris," Ray said. "Eat 
it, it's good." 

Doris started to cry. "No, 1 
don't like it." 

"Eat it!" 

Ray turned away suddenly, his 



body shaking. Richard tried to 
think of some way to make her 
eat the pills, but he couldn't. 

Then his mother spoke. "We'll 
play a game, Doris," she said. 
"We'll see if you can swallow all 
the candy before I count ten. If 
you do, I'll give you a dollar." 

Doris sniffed. "A dollar?" she 
said. 

Richard's mother nodded. 
"One," she said. 

Doris didn't move. 

"Two," said Richard's mother. 
"A dollar . . ." 

Doris brushed aside a tear. 
"A . . . whole dollar? " 

"Yes, darling. Three, four, 
hurry up." 

Doris reached for the pills. 

"Five . . . six . . . seven . . ." 

Grace had her eyes shut tightly. 
Her cheek's were white. 

"Nine . . . ten ..." 

Richard's mother smiled, but 
her lips trembled and there was a 
glistening in her eyes. "There," 
she said cheerfully. "You've won 
the game." 

Grace suddenly put pills into 
her mouth and swallowed them 
in fast succession. She looked at 
Ray. He reached out one trem- 
bling hand and swallowed his pills. 
Richard put his hand in his pocket 
for his pills but took it out again. 
He didn't want his mother to 
watch him take them. 

Doris got sleepy almost imme- 
diately. She yawned and couldn't

keep her eyes open. Ray picked 
her up and she rested against 
his shoulder, her small arms around 
his neck. Grace got up and the 
three of them went back into the 
bedroom. 

Richard sat there while his 
mother went back and said good- 
bye to them. He sat staring at the 
white tablecloth, at the remains of 
food. 

When his mother came back she 
smiled at him. "Help me with the 
dishes," she said. 

"The . . .?" he started. Then 



he stopped. What difference did it 
make what they did? 

He stood with her in the red-lit 
kitchen feeling a sense of sharp 
unreality as he dried the dishes 
they would never use again and 
put them in the closet that would 
be no more in a matter of hours. 

He kept thinking about Ray 
£fhd Grace in the bedroom. Finally 
he left the kitchen without a word 
and went back. He opened the 
door and looked in. He looked at 
the three of them for a long time. 
Then he shut the door again and 




walked slowly back to the kitchen. 
He stared at his mother. 

"They're . . ." 

"All right," his mother said. 

"Why didn't you say anything 
to them?" he asked her. "How 
come you let them do it without 
Baying anything?" 

" Richard," she said, "everyone 
has to make his own way on this 
day. No one can tell others what 
to do. Doris was their child." 

"And I'm yours. . . ." 

"You're not a child any longer," 
she said. 

He finished up the dishes, his 
fingers numb and shaking, " Mom, 
about last night . . ."he started. 

"I don't care about it." 

"But . . ." 

"It doesn't matter," she said. 
"This part is ending." 

Now, he thought, almost with 
pain. This part. Now she would 
talk about afterlife and heaven 
and reward for the just and 
eternal penitence for the sinning. 

She said, "Let's go out and sit 
on the porch." 

He didn't understand. He 
walked through the quiet house 
with her. He sat next to her on 
the porch steps and thought: I'll 
riever see Grace again. Or Doris. 
Or Norman or Spencer or Mary. 

He couldn't take it all in. It 
was too much. All he could do was 
sit there woodenly and look at the 
red sky and the huge sun about to 
swallow them. He couldn't even 
feel nervous any more. Fears were 



blunted by endless repetition. 

"Mom," he said after a while, 
"why . . . why haven't you spo- 
ken about religion to me? I know 
you must want to." 

She looked at him and her face 
was very gentle in the red glow. 
"I don't have to, darling," she 
said . " I know we'll be together 
when this is over. You don't have 
to believe it. I'll believe for both 
of us." 

And that was all. He looked at 
her, wordless before her confidence. 

"If you want to take those pills 
now," she said, " it's all right. 
You can go to sleep in my lap." 

He felt himself tremble. "You 
wouldn't mind?" 

" I want you to do what you 
think is best." 

I le didn't know what to do until 
he thought of her sitting there 
alone when the world ended. 

"I'll stay with you," he said. 

She smiled. " If you change your 
mind," she said, "you can tell 
me." 

They were quiet for a while. 
Then she said, "It is pretty." 

"Pretty?" he asked. 

"Yes," she said. "God closes 
a bright curtain on our play." 

He didn't know. But he put his 
arm around her shoulders and 
she leaned against him. And he 
did know one thing. 

They sat there in the evening 
of the last day. And, though there 
was no actual point to it, they 
loved each other.
