The Martian Way 



It was junk they hunted, but enormously valuable and urgently 
needed junk that cost only bravery and the cheapest fuel . . . 
yet they were kept from collecting It by an even cheaper lie!

FROM the doorway of the 
short corridor between the 
only two rooms in the 
travel-head of the spaceship, 
Mario Esteban Rjoz watched 
sourly as Ted Long adjusted the 
vTdeo dials painstakingly. Long 
tried a touch clockwise, then a 
touch counter. The picture was 
lousy. 

Rioz knew it would stay lousy. 
They were too far from Earth 
and at a bad position facing the 
Sun. But then Long would not be 
expected to know that. Rioz re


mained standing in the doorway 
for an additional moment, head 
bent to clear the upper lintel, 
body turned half sidewise to fit 
the narrow opening. Then he 
jerked into the galley like a cork 
popping out of a bottle. 

''What are you after?" he asked. 

"I thought I'd get Hilder," said 
Long. 

Rioz propped his rump on the 
corner of a table-shelf. He lifted 
a conical can of milk from the 
companion shelf just above his 
head. Its point popped under 
pressure. He swirled it gently as

he waited for it to warm. 

"What for?" he said. He upended the cone and sucked noisily. 

"Thought I'd listen." 

"I think it's a waste of power." 

Long looked up, frowning. "It's 
customary to allow free use of 
personal video sets." 

"Within reason," retorted Rioz. 

THEIR eyes met challengingly. 
Rioz had the rangy body, the 
gaunt, cheek -sunken face that 
was almost the hallmark of the 
Martian Scavenger, those Spacers 
who patiently haunted the space 
routes between Earth and Mars. 
Pale blue eyes were set keenly 
in the brown, lined face which, 
in turn, stood darkly out against 
thg white, surrounding syntho-fur 
that lined the upturned collar of 
his leathtic space-jacket. 

Long was altogether paler and 
softer. He bore some of the marks 
of the Grounder, although no 
second -generation Martian could 
be a Grounder in the sense that 
Earthmen were. His own collar 
was thrown back and his dark 
brown hair freely exposed. 
1 "What do you call within reason?" demanded Long. 

Rioz's thin lips grew thinner. 
He said, "Considering that we're 
not even going to make expenses 
this trip, the way it looks, any 
power drain at all is outside reason." 



Long said, "If we're losing 
money, hadn't you better get 
back to your post? It's your 
watch." 

Rioz grunted and ran a thumb 
and forefinger over the stubble 
on his chin. He got up and 
trudged to the door, his soft, 
heavy boots muting the sound of 
his steps. He paused to look at 
the thermostat, then turned with 
a flare of fury. 

"I thought it was hot. Where 
do you think you are?" 

Long said, "Forty degrees isn't 
excessive." 

"For you it isn't, maybe. But 
this is space, not a heated office 
at the iron mines." Rioz swung 
the thermostat control down to 
minimum with a quick thumb 
movement. "Sun's warm enough." 

"The galley isn't on Sunside." 

"It'll percolate through, damn 
it." 

Rioz stepped through the door 
and Long stared after him for 
a long moment, then turned back 
to the video. He did not turn 
up the thermostat. 

The picture was still flickering 
badly, but it would have to do. 
Long folded a chair down out 
the wall. He leaned forward 
waiting through the formal announcement, the momentary 
pause before the slow dissolution 
of the curtain, the spotlight picking out the well-known bearded 
figure which grew as it was

brought forward until it filled the 
screen. 

The voice, impressive even 
through the Outings and croakings induced by the electron 
storms of twenty millions of 
miles, began : 

"Friends! My fellow-citizens of 
Earth — " 

II 

TJIOZ'S eye caught the flash of 
the radio signal as he stepped 
into the pilot room. For one 
moment the palms of his hands 
grew clammy when it seemed to 
him that it was a radar pip; but 
that was only his guilt speaking. 
He should not have left the pilot 
room while on duty, theoretically, 
though all Scavengers did it. Still, 
it was the standard nightmare, 
this business of a strike turning 
up during just those five minutes 
when one knocked off for a quick 
coffee because it seemed certain 
that space was clear. And the 
nightmare had been known to 
happen, too. 

Rioz threw in the multi-scanner. It was a waste of power, but 
while he was' thinking about it. 
he might as well make sure. 

Space was clear except for the 
far distant echoes from the neighboring ships on the scavenging 
line. 

He hooked up the radio circuit, 
and the blond, long-nosed head 



of Richard Swenson, co-pilot of 
the next ship on the Marsward 
side, filled it. 

"Hey, Mario," said Swenson. 

"Hi. What's new?" 

There was a second and a fraction of pause between that and 
Swenson 's next comment, since 
the speed of electromagnetic radiation is not infinite. 

"What a day I've had." 

"Something happened ?" Rioz 
asked. 

"I had a strike." 

"Well, good." 

"Sure, if I'd roped it in," said 
Swenson morosely. 

"What happened?" 

"Damn it, I headed in the 
wrong direction." 

Rioz knew better than to laugh. 
He said, "How did you do that?" 

"It wasn't my fault. The 
trouble was the shell was moving 
way out of the ecliptic. Can you 
imagine the stupidity of a pilot 
that can't work the release maneuver decently? How was I to 
know? I got the distance of the 
shell and let it go at that. I 
just assumed its orbit was in 
the usual trajectory family. 
Wouldn't you? I started along 
what I thought was a good line 
of intersection and it was five 
minutes before I noticed the 'distance was still going up. The pips 
were taking their sweet time returning. So then I took the angular projections of the thing, and it

was too late to catch up with it." 

"Any of the other boys getting 
it?" 

"No. It's way out of the ecliptic 
and'll keep on going forever. 
That's not what bothers me so 
much. It was only an inner shell. 
But I hate to tell you how many 
tons of propulsion I wasted getting up speed and then getting 
back to station. You should have 
heard Canute." 

Canute was Richard Swenson's 
brother and partner. 

"Mad, huh?" said Rioz. 

"Mad? Like to have killed me! 
But then we've been out five 
months now and it's getting kind 
of sticky. You know." 

"I know." 

"How are you doing, Mario?" 

Rioz made a spitting gesture. 
"ASbut that much this trip. Two 
shells in the last two weeks and 
I had to chase each one for six 
hours." 

"Big ones?" 

"Are you kidding? I could have 
scaled them down to Phobos by 
hand. This is the worst trip I've 
ever had." 

"How much longer are you 
staying?" 

"For my. part, we can quit tomorrow. We've only been out two 
months and it's got so I'm chewing Long out all the time." 

There was a pause over and 
above the electromagnetic lag. 

Swenson said, "What's he like. 



anyway? Long, I mean." 

Rioz looked over his shoulder. 
He could hear the soft, crackly 
mutter of the video in the galley. 
"I can't make him out. He says 
to me about a week after the start 
of the trip, 'Mario, why are you 
a Scavenger?' I just look at him 
and say, 'To make a living. Why 
do you suppose?' I mean, what 
the hell kind of a question is 
that? Why is anyone a Scavenger? 

"Anyway, he says, 'That's not 
it, Mario.' He's telling me, you 
see. He says, 'You're a Scavenger 
because this is part of the Martian way.' " 

Swenson said, "And what did 
he mean by that?" 

Rioz shrugged. "I never asked 
him. Right now he's sitting in 
there listening to the ultra-microwave from Earth. He's listening 
to some Grounder called Hilder." 

"Hilder? A Grounder politician, an Assemblyman or something, isn't he?" • 

"That's right. At least, I think 
that's right. Long is always doing 
things like that. He brought about 
fifteen pounds of books with him, 
all about Earth. Just plain dead 
weight, you know." 

"Well, he's your parfltxer. And 
talking about partners, I think I'll 
get back on the job. If I iniss 
another strike, there'll be murder 
around here." 

He was gone and Rioz leaned 



8 



GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTION 



back. He watched the even green 
line that was the pulse-scanner. 
He tried the multi-scanner a 
moment. Space was still clear. 

TIE felt a little better. A bad 
-"■spell is always worse if the 
Scavengers all about you are pulling in shell after shell; if the shells 
go spiraling down to the Phobos 
scrap - forges with everyone's 
brand welded on except your 
own. Then, too, he had managed 
to work off some of his resentment toward Long. 

It was a mistake, teaming up 
with Long. It was always a mistake to team up with a tenderfoot. 
They thought what you wanted 
was conversation, especially Long, 
with his eternal theories about 
Mars and its great new role in 
human progress. That was the 
way he said it- — Human Progress; 
the Martian Way; the New Creative Minority. And all the time 
what Rio2 wanted wasn't talk, 
but a strike, a few shells to call 
their own. 

At that, he hadn't any choice, 
really. Long was pretty well 
known down on Mars and made 
good pay as a mining engineer. 
He was a friend of Commissioner 
Sankov and he'd been out on 
one or two short scavenging missions before. You can't turn a fellow down flat before a tryout . 
even though it did look funny. 
Why shpuld a mining engineer 



with a comfortable job and good 
money want to muck around in 
space? 

Rioz never asked Long that 
question. Scavenger partners are 
forced too closely together to 
make curiosity desirable, or 
sometimes even safe. But Long 
talked so much that he answered 
the question. 

"I had to come out here. Mario," he said. "The future of Mars 
isn't in the mines; it's in space." 

Rioz wondered how it would 
be to try a trip alone. Everyone 
said it was impossible. Even discounting lost opportunities when 
one man had to go off watch to 
sleep or attend to other things, 
it was well known that one man 
alone in space would become intolerably depressed in a relatively 
short while. 

Taking a partner along made a 
six-month trip possible. A regular 
crew would be better, but no 
Scavenger could make money on 
a ship large enough to carry one. 
The capital it would take in propulsion alone! 

Even two didn't find it exactly 
fun in space. Usually, you had to 
change partners each trip and 
you could stay out longer with 
some than with others. Look at 
Richard and Canute Swenson. 
They teamed up every five or 
six trips because they were brothers. And yet whenever they did. 
it was a case of constantly mount

ing tension and antagonism after 
the first week. 

Oh, well. Space was clear. Rioz 
would feel a little better if he 
went back in the galley and 
smoothed down some of the bickering with Long. He might as 
well show he was an old spacehand who took the irritations of 
space as they came. 

He stood up, walked the three 
steps necessary to reach the short, 
narrow corridor that tied together 
the two rooms of the spaceship. 

Ill 

ONCE again, Rioz stood in the 
doorway for a moment, 
watching. Long was intent on the 
flickering screen. 

Jiioz said, gruffly, "I'm shoving 
up the thermostat. It's all right — 
we can spare the power." 
Long nodded. "If you like." 
Rioz took a hesitant step forward. Space was clear, so to hell 
with sitting and looking at a 
blank, green, pipless line. He said, 
"What's the Grounder been talking about?" 

"History of space travel, mostly. Old stuff, but he's doing it 
well. He's giving the whole works 
— color cartoons, trick photography, stills from old films, everything." 

As if to illustrate Long's remarks, the bearded figure faded 
out of view, and a cross- sectional 



view of a spaceship flitted onto 
the screen. Hilder's voice continued, pointing out features of 
interest that appeared in schematic color. The communications 
system of the ship outlined itself 
iri red as he talked about it, the 
storerooms, the proton micro-pile 
drive, the cybernetic circuits — 

Then Hilder was back on the 
screen. "But this is only the 
travel-head of the ship. What 
moves it? What gets it off the 
Earth?" 

Everyone knew what moved a 
spaceship, but Hilder's voice was 
like a drug. He made spaceship 
propulsion sound like the secret 
of the ages, like an ultimate revelation. Even Rioz felt a slight 
-tingling of suspense, though he 
had spent the greater part of his 
life aboard ship. 

Hilder went on. "Scientists call 
it different names. They call it the 
Law of Action and Reaction. 
Sometimes they call it Newton's 
Third Law. Sometimes they call 
it Conservation of Momentum. 
But we don't have to call it any 
name. We can just use our common sense. When we swim, we 
push water backward and move 
forward ourselves. When we walk, 
we push back against the ground 
and move forward. When we fly a 
gyro-flivver, we push air backward and move forward. 

"Nothing can move forward 
unless something else moves 




 



backward. It's the old principle of 
'You can't get something for 
nothing.' 

"Now imagine a spaceship that 
weighs a hundred thousand tons 
lifting off Earth. To do that, 
something else must be moved 
downward. Since a spaceship is 
extremely heavy, a great deal of 
material must b. moved downward- So much material, in fact, 
that there is no place to keep it 
all aboard ship. A special compartment must be built behind 
the ship to hold it." 

Again Hilder faded out and the 
ship returned. It shrank and a 
truncated cone appeared behind 
it. In bright yellow, words appeared within it: material to be 

THROWN AWAY. 

"But now," said Hilder, "the 
total weight of the ship is much 
greater. You need still more propulsion and still more." 

The ship shrank enormously to 
add on another larger shell and 
still another immense one. The 
ship proper, the travel-head, was 
a little dot on the screen, a glowing red dot. 

Rioz said, "Hell, this is kindergarten stuff." 

"Not to the people he's speaking to, Mario," replied Long. 
"Earth isn't Mars. There must be 
billions of Earth people who've 
never even seen a spaceship; don't 
know the first thing about it." 

Hilder was saying, "When the 



material inside the biggest shell 
is used up, the shell is detached. 
It's thrown away, too." 

The outermost shell came 
loose, wobbled about the screen. 

"Then the second one goes," 
said Hilder, "and then, if the 
trip is a long one, the last is 
ejected." 

The ship was just a red dot 
now, with three shells shifting 
and moving, lost in space. 

Hilder said, "These shells represent a hundred thousand tons 
of tungsten, magnesium, aluminum, and steel. They are gone 
forever from Earth. Mars is ringed by scavengers, waiting along 
the routes of space travel, waiting for the cast-off shells, netting 
and branding them, saving them 
for Mars. Not one cent of payment reaches Earth for them. 
They are salvage. They belong 
to the ship that finds them." 

RIOZ said, "We risk our investment and our lives. If we 
don't pick them up, no one gets 
them. What loss is that to 
Earth?" 

"Look," said Long, "he's been 
talking about nothing but the 
drain that Mars, Venus and the 
Moon put on Earth. This is just 
another item of loss." 

''They'll get their return. We're 
mining more iron every year." 

"And most of it goes right back 
into Mars. If you can believe 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



11 



his figures. Earth has invested 
two hundred billion dollars in 
Mars and received back about 
five billion dollars worth of iron. 
It's put five hundred billion dollars into the Moon and gotten 
back a little over twenty-five billion dollars of magnesium, titanium and assorted light metals. It's 
put fifty billion dollars into Venus 
and gotten back nothing. And 
that's what the taxpayers of 
Earth are really interested in — 
tax money out; nothing in." 

The screen was filled, as he 
spoke, with diagrams of the scavengers on the route to Mars; 
little, grinning caricatures of 
ships, reaching out wiry, tenuous 
arms that groped for the tumbling, empty shells, seizing and 
snaking them in, branding them 
mars property in glowing letters, 
then scaling them down to Phobos. 

Then it was Hilder again. 
"They tell us eventually they will 
return it all to us. Eventually! 
Once they are a going concern! 
We don't know when that will be. 
A century from now? A thousand 
years? A million? 'Eventually.' 
Let's take them at their word. 
Some day they will give us back 
all our metals. Some day they 
will grow their own food, use their 
own power, live their own lives. 

"But one thing they can never 
return. Not in a hundred million 
years. Water! 



"Mars has only a trickle of 
water because it is too small. 
Venus has no water at all because 
it is too hot. The Moon has none 
because it is too hot and too 
small. So Earth must supply not 
only drinking water and washing 
water for the Spacers, water to 
run their industries, water for the 
hydroponic factories they claim 
to be setting up — but even water 
to throw away by the millions of 
tons. 

"What is the propulsive force 
that spaceships use? What is it 
they throw out behind so that 
they can accelerate forward? Once 
it was the gases generated from 
explosives. That was very expensive. Then the proton micropile was invented — a cheap power 
source that could heat up any 
liquid until it was a gas under 
tremendous pressure. What is the 
cheapest and most plentiful liquid 
available? Why, water, of course. 

"Each spaceship leaves Earth 
carrying nearly a million tons — 
not pounds, rons — of water, for 
the sole purpose of driving it into 
space so that it may speed up or 
slow down. 

"Our ancestors burned the oil 
of Earth madly and wilfully. 
They destroyed its coal recklessly. Wc despise and condemn 
them for that, but at least they 
had this excuse — they thought 
that when the need arose, substitutes would be found. And they 




 



were right. We have our plankton 
farms and our proton micro-piles. 

"But there is no substitute for 
water. None! There never can be. 
And when our descendants view 
the desert we will have made of 
Earth, what excuse will they find 
for us? When the droughts come 
and grow — " 

T ONG leaned forward and 
turned off the set. He said, 
"That bothers me. The damn fool 
is deliberately — What's the matter?" 

Rioz had risen uneasily to his 
feet. "I ought to be watching the 
pips." 

"The hell with the pips." Long 
got up likewise, followed Rioz 
through the narrow corridor and 
stood just inside the pilot room. 
"If Hilder carries this through, 
if he's got the guts to make a real 
issue out of it — Wow.'" 

He had seen it, too. The pip 
was a Class A. racing after the 
outgoing signal like a greyhound 
after a mechanical rabbit. 

Rioz was babbling, "Space was 
clear, I tell you. clear. For Mars' 
sake. Ted, don't just freeze on 
me. See if you can spot it visually." 

Rioz was working speedily and 
with an efficiency that was the 
result of nearly twenty years of 
scavenging. He had the distance 
in two minutes. Then, remembering Swt nson's experience, he mea


sured the angle of declination and 
the radial velocity as well. 

He yelled at Long, "One point 
seven six radians. You can't miss 
it. man." 

Long held his breath as he adjusted the vernier. "It's only half 
a radian off the Sun. It'll only 
be crescent-lit." 

He increased magnification as 
rapidly as he dared, watching for 
the one "star" that changed position and grew to have a form, 
revealing itself to be no star. 

"I'm starting, anyway," said 
Rioz. "We can't wait." 

"I've got it. I've got it." Magnification was still too small to 
give it a definite shape, but the 
dot Long watched was brightening and dimming rhythmically, 
as the shell rotated and caught 
sunlight on cross-sections of cyclically different sizes. 

"Hold on." 

The first of many fine spurts 
of steam squirted out of the 
proper vents, leaving long trails 
of micro-crystals of ice, gleaming 
mistily in the pale beams of the 
distant Sun. They thinned out 
for a hundred miles or more. One 
spurt, then another, then another, 
as the Scavenger ship moved out 
of its stable trajectory and took 
up a course tangential to that of 
the shell. 

"It's moving like a comet at 
perihelion!" yelled Rioz. "Those 
damned Grounder pilots knock 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



13 



the shells off that way on purpose. 
I'd like to — " 

He swore his anger in a frustrated frenzy as he kicked steam 
backward and backward recklessly, till the hydraulic cushioning 
of his chair had soughed back a 
full foot and Long had found 
himself all but unable to maintain his grip on the guard rail. 

"Have a heart," he begged. 

But Rioz had his eye on the 
pips. "If you can't take it, man. 
stay on Mars!" The steam spurts 
continued to boom distantly. 

The radio came to life. Long 
managed to lean forward through 
what seemed like molasses and 
closed contact. It was Swenson. 
eyes glaring. 

Swenson yelled, "Where the 
hell*ire you guys going? You'll be 
in my sector in ten seconds." 

Rioz said. "I'm chasing a 
shell." 

"In my sector?" 

"It started in mine and you're 
not in position to get it. Shut off 
that radio, Ted." 

r ¥^HE ship thundered through 
space, a thunder that could 
be heard only within the hull. 
And then Rioz cut the engines 
in stages large enough to make 
Long flail forward. The sudden 
silence was more ear-shattering 
than the noise that had preceded 
it. 

Rioz said, "All right. Let me 



have the 'scope." 

They both watched. The shell 
was a definite truncated cone 
now. tumbling with slow solemnity as it passed along among the 
stars. 

"It's a Class A shell, all right." 
said Rioz, with satisfaction. A 
giant among shells, he thought. It 
would put them into the black. 

Long said, "We've got another 
pip on the scanner. I think it's 
Swenson taking after us." 

Rioz scarcely gave it a glance. 
"He won't catch us." 

The shell grew larger still, 
filling the visiplate. 

Rioz's hands were on the harpoon lever. He waited, adjusted 
the angle microscopically twice, 
played out the length allotment. 
Then he yanked, tripping the release. 

For a moment, nothing happened. Then a metal mesh cable 
snaked out onto the visiplate, 
moving toward the shell like a 
striking cobra. It made contact, 
but it did not hold. If it had. 
been designed to hold, it would 
have snapped instantly like a 
cobweb strand. The shell was 
turning with a rotational momentum amounting to thousands of 
tons. What the cable did do was 
to set up a powerful magnetic 
field that acted as a brake on 
the shell. 

Another cable and another 
lashed out. Rioz sent them out 



)4 




 



in an almost heedless expenditure 
of energy. 

"I'll get this one ! By Mars, 
I'll get this one!" 

With some two dozen cables 
stretching between ship and shell, 
he desisted. The shell's rotational 
energy, converted by braking into heat, had raised its temperature to a point where its radiation 
could be picked up by the ship's 
meters. 

Long said, "Do you want me 
to put our brand on?" 

"Suits me. But you don't have 
to, if you don't want to. It's my 
watch." 

"I don't mind." 

Long clambered into his suit 
and went out the lock. It was 
the surest sign of his newness 
to the game that he could count 
the number of times he had been 
out in space in a suit. This was 
the fifth time. 

He went out along the nearest 
cable, hand over hand, feeling 
the vibration of the mesh against 
the metal of his mitten. 

He burned their serial number 
in the smooth metal of the shell. 
There was nothing to oxidize the 
steel in the emptiness of space. 
It simply melted and vaporized, 
condensing some feet away from 
the energy beam, turning the surface it touched into a gray, powdery dullness. 

Long swung back toward the 
ship. • 



Inside again, he took off his 
helmet, white and thick with frost 
that collected as soon as he had 
entered. 

The first thing he heard was 
Swenson's voice coming over the 
radio in thick, almost unrecognizable rage: " — straight to the 
Commissioner. Damn it. there are 
rules to this game!" 

Rioz sat back, unbothered. 
"Look, it hit my sector. I was 
late spotting it and I chased it 
into yours. You couldn't have 
gotten it with Mars for a backstop. That's all there is to it — You 
back, Long?" 

He cut contact. 

The signal button raged at him. 
but he paid no attention. 

"He's going to the Commissioner?" Long asked. 

"Not a chance. He just goes on 
like that because it breaks the 
monotony. He doesn't mean anything by it. He knows it's our 
shell. And how do you like that 
hunk of stuff. Ted?" 

"Pretty good." 

"Pretty good? It's terrific! Hold 
on. I'm setting it swinging." 

The side jets spat steam and 
the ship started a slow rotation 
about the shell. The shell followed it. In thirty minutes, they 
were a gigantic bolo spinning in 
emptiness. Long checked the 
Ephemeris for the position of 
Deimos. 

At a precisely calculated mo

merit, the cables released their 
magnetic field and the shell went 
streaking off tangentially in a trajectory that would, in a day or 
::o, bring it within pronging distance of the shell -stores on the, 
Martian satellite. 

Rioz watched it go. He felt 
good. He turned to Long. "This 
is one fine day for us." 

"What about Hilder's speech?" 
asked Long. 

"What? Who? Oh, that. Listen, 
if I had to worry about everything some damned Grounder 
said, I'd never get any sleep. 
Forget it." 

"I don't think we should forget 
it." 

"You're nuts. Don't bother me 
about it, will you? Get some sleep 
instead." 

IV 

rpED LONG found the breadth 
and height of the city's main 
thoroughfare exhilarating. It had 
been two months since the Commissioner had declared a moratorium on scavenging and had 
pulled all ships out of space, but 
this feeling of a stretched -out 
vista had not stopped thrilling 
Long. Even the thought that the 
moratorium was called pending 
a decision on the part of Earth 
to enforce its new insistence on 
water economy, by deciding upon 
a ration limit for scavenging, did 



not cast him entirely down. 

The roof of the avenue was 1 
painted a luminous light blue, 
perhaps as an old-fashioned imitation of Earth's sky. Ted wasn't 
sure. The walls were lit with the 
store windows that pierced it. 

Off in the distance, over the 
hum of traffic and the sluffing 
noise of people's feet passing him, 
he could hear the intermittent 
blasting as new channels were being bored into Mars' crust. All 
his life he remembered such blastings. The ground he walked on 
had been part of solid unbroken rock when he was born. The city 
was growing and would keep on 
growing — if Earth would only let 
it. • •-. 

He turned off at a cross-street, 
narrower, not quite as brilliantly 
lit, shop windows giving way to 
apartment houses, each with its 
row of lights along the front facade. Shoppers and traffic gave 
way to slower-paced individuals 
and to squawling youngsters who 
had as yet evaded the maternal 
summons to the evening meal. 

At the last minute, Long remembered the social amenities 
and stopped off at a corner water 
store. 

He passed over his canteen. 
"Fill 'er up." 

The plump storekeeper unscrewed the cap, cocked an eye 
into the opening. He shook it a 
little and let it gurgle. "Not much

left," he said cheerfully. 

"No," agreed Long. 

The storekeeper trickled water 
in, holding the neck of the canteen close to the hose tip to avoid 
spillage. The volume gauge 
whirred. He screwed the cap back 
on. 

Long passed over the coins and 
took his canteen. It clanked 
against his hip now with a pleasing heaviness. It would never do 
to a visit a family without a full 
canteen. Among the boys, it 
didn't matter. Not as much, anyway. 

He entered the hallway of number 27, climbed a short flight of 
stairs, and paused with his thumb 
on the signal. 

The sound of voices could be 
heard quite plainly. 

One was a woman's voice, 
somewhat shrill. "It's all right for 
you to have your Scavenger 
friends here, isn't it? I'm supposed to be thankful you manage 
to get home two months a year. 
Oh, it's quite enough that you 
spend a day or two with me. After 
that, it's the Scavengers again." 

"I've been home for a long 
time now," said a male voice, 
"and this is business. For Mars' 
sake, let up, Dora. They'll be here 
soon." 

Long decided to wait a moment 
before signaling. It might give 
them a chance to hit a more neutral topic. 



"What do I care if they come?" 
retorted Dora. "Let them hear 
me. And I'd just as soon the 
Commissioner kept the moratorium on permanently. You hear 
me?" 

"And what would we live on?" 
came the male voice, hotly. "You 
tell me that." 

"I'Tl tell you. You can make a 
decent, honorable living right here 
on Mars, juit like everybody else. 
I'm the only one in this apartment house that's a Scavenger 
widow. That's what I am — a widow. I'm worse than a widow, 
because if I were a widow, I'd 
at least have a chance to marry 
someone else — What did you 
say?" 

"Nothing. Nothing at all." 

"Oh, I know what you said. 
Now listen here, Dick Swenson — " 

"I only said," cried Swenson, 
"that now I know why Scavengers usually don't marry." 

"You shouldn't have, either. 
I'm tired of having every person 
in the neighborhood pity me and 
smirk and ask when you're coming home. Other people can be 
mining engineers and administrators and even tunnel -borers. 
At least tunnel -borers' wives have 
a decent home-life and their children don't grow up like vagabonds. Peter might as well not 
have a father — " 

A thin boy-soprano voice made 
its way through the door. It was 



18 




 



somewhat more distant, as though 
it were in another room. "Hey, 
Mom, what's a vagabond?" 

Dora's voice rose a notch. 
"Peter! You keep your mind on 
your homework." 

Swenson said, in a low voice, 
"It's not right to talk this way 
in front of the kid. What kind 
of notions will he get about me?" 

"Stay home then and teach him 
better notions." 

Peter's voice called out again. 
"Hey, Mom, I'm going to be a 
Scavenger when I. grow up." 

Footsteps sounded rapidly. 
There was a momentary hiatus 
in the sounds, then a piercing, 
"Mom! Hey, Mom! Leggo my 
ear! What did I do?" and a snuffling silence. 

Long seized the chance. He 
worked the signal vigorously. 

OWENSON opened the door, 
^ brushing down his hair with 
both hands. 

"Hello, Ted," he said, in a subdued voice. Then loudly, "Ted's 
here, .Dora. Where's Mario, Ted?" 

Long said, "He'll be here in 
a while." 

Dora came hustling out of the 
next room, a small, dark woman 
with a pinched nose, and hair, 
just beginning to show touches 
of gray, combed off the forehead. 

"Hello, Ted. Have you eaten?" 
"Quite well, thanks. I haven't 



interrupted you, have I?" 

"Not at all. We finished ages 
ago. Would you like some coffee?" 

"I think so." Ted unslung his 
canteen and offered it. 

"Oh, goodness, that's all right. 
We've plenty of water." 

"I insist." 

"Well, then—" 

Back into the kitchen she went. 
Through the swinging door, Long 
caught a glimpse of dishes sitting in Secoterg, the "waterless 
cleaner that soaks up and absorbs grease and dirt in a twinkling. One ounce of water will 
rinse eight square feet of dish 
surface clean as clean. Buy Secoterg. Secoterg just cleans it right, 
makes your dishes shiny bright, 
does away with water waste — " 

The tune started whining 
through his mind and Long 
crushed it with speech. He said, 
"How's Pete?" 

"Fine, fine. The kid's in the 
fourth grade now. You know, I 
don't get to see him much. Well, 
sir, when I came back last time, 
he, looked at me and said — " 

It went on for a while and 
wasn't too bad as bright-sayingsof - bright - children - as - told by -dull -parents go. 

The door signal burped and 
Mario Rioz came in, frowning 
and red. 

Swenson stepped to him quickly. "Listen, don't say anything 



THE MARTIAN WAY

about shell-snaring. Dora still remembers the time you fingered a 
Class A shell out of my territory 
and she's in one of her moods 
now." 

"Who the hell wants to talk 
about shells?" Rioz slung off a 
fur-lined jacket, threw it over 
the back of the chair, and sat 
down. 

Dora came through the swinging door, viewed the newcomer 
with a synthetic smile and said, 
"Hello, Mario. Coffee for you, 
too?" 

"Yeah," he said, reaching automatically for his canteen. 

"Just use some more of my 
water, Dora," said Long, quickly. 
"He'll owe it to me." 

"Yeah," said Rioz. 
%'What's wrong, Mario?" asked 
l.ong. 

Rioz said, heavily. "Go on. Say 
you told me so. A year ago, when 
Hilder made that speech, you told 
me so. Say it." 

Long shrugged. 

Rioz said, "They've set up the 
quota. Fifteen minutes ago, the 
news came out." 

"Well?" 

"Fifty thousand tons of water 
per trip." * , 

"What?" yelled Swenson. burning. "You can't get off Mars with 
fifty thousand!" 

"That's the figure. It's a deliberate piece of gutting. No more 
scavenging." 



TAORA came out with the coffee 
and set it down all around. 
"What's all this about ho more 
scavenging?" She sat down very 
firmly and Swenson looked helpless. 

"It seems," said Long, "that 
they're rationing us at fifty thousand tons and that means we 
can't make any more trips." 

"Well, what of it?" Dora sipped 
her coffee and smiled gaily. "If 
you want my opinion, it's a good 
thing. It's time all you Scavengers found yourselves a nice, 
steady job here on Mars. . I mean 
it. It's no life to be running all 
over space — " 

"Please, Dora," said Swenson. 

Rioz came close to a snort. 

Dora raised' her eyebrows. "I'm 
just giving my opinions." 

Long said, "Please feel free to 
do so. But I would like to say 
something. Fifty thousand is just 
a detail. We know that Earth — 
or at least Hilder's party — wants 
to make political capital out of a 
campaign for water economy, so 
we're in a bad hole. We've got 
to get water somehow, or they'll 
shut us down altogether, right?" 

"Well, sure," said Swenson. 

"But the question is how. 
right?" 

"If it's only getting water," 
said Rioz, in a sudden gush of 
words, "there's only one thing 
to do and you know it. If the 
Grounders won't give us water, 




 



we'll take it. The water doesn't 
belong to them just because their 
fathers and grandfathers were too 
damned sick-yellow ever to leave 
their fat planet. Water belongs 
to people wherever they are. 
We're people and the water's 
ours, too. We have a right to it." 

"How do you propose taking 
it?" asked Long. 

"Easy! They've got oceans of 
water on Earth. They can't post 
a guard over every square mile. 
We can sink down on the night 
side of the planet any time we 
want, fill our shells, then get 
away. How can they stop lis?" 

"In half a dozen ways, Mario. 
How do you spot shells in space 
up to distances of a hundred 
thousand miles? One thin metal 
shell in all that space. How? By 
radar. Do you think there's no 
radar on Earth? Do you think 
that if Earth ever gets the notion 
we're engaged in waterlegging, it 
won't be simple for them to set 
up a radar network to spot ships 
coming in from space?" 

Dora broke in, indignantly. 
"I'll tell you one thing, Mario 
Rioz. My husband isn't going to 
be part of any raid to get water 
to keep up his scavenging with." 

"It isn't just scavenging," said 
Mario. "Next they'll be cutting 
down on everything else. We've 
got to stop them now." 

"But we don't need their water, 
anyway," said Dora. "We're not 



the Moon or Venus. We pipe 
enough water down from the 
polar caps for all we need. We 
have a water tap right in this 
apartment. There's one in every 
apartment on this block." 

Long said, "Home use is the 
smallest part of it. The mines 
use water. And what do we do 
about the hydroponic tanks?" 

"That's right," said Swenson. 
"What about the ' hydroponic 
tanks, Dora? They've got to have 
water and it's about time we arranged to grow our own fresh 
food instead of having to live on 
the condensed crud they ship us 
from Earth." 

"Listen to him." said Dora, 
scornfully. "What do you know 
about fresh food? You've never 
eaten any." 

"I've eaten more than you 
think. Do you remember those 
carrots I picked up once?" 

"Well, what was so wonderful 
about them? If you ask me, good 
baked protomeal is much better. 
And healthier, too. It just seems 
to be the fashion now to be talking fresh vegetables, because 
they're increasing taxes for these 
hydroponics. Besides, all this will 
blow over." 

T ONG said. "I don't think so. 

Not by itself, anyway. Hilder 
will probably be the next Coordinator and then things may 
really get bad. If they cut. down 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



on food shipments, too — " 

"Well, then," shouted Rioz, 
"what do we do? I still cay take 
it! Take the water!" 

"And I say we can't do that, 
Mario. Don't you see that what 
you're suggesting is the Earth 
way, the Grounder way? You're 
trying to hold on to the umbilical cord that ties Mars to Earth. 
Can't you get away from that? 
Can't you s« the Martian way?" 

"No, I can't. Suppose you tell 
me." 

"I will, if you'll listen. When 
we think about the Solar System, 
what do we think about? Mercury, Venus. Earth, Moon. Mars, 
Phobos, and Deimos. There you 
are — seven bodies, that's all. But 
that doesn't represent one per 
cant of the Solar System. We 
Martians are right at the edge of 
the other ninety -nine per cent. 
Out there, farther from the Sun, 
there's unbelievable amounts of 
water!" 

The others stared. 

Swenson said, uncertainly. 
"You mean the layers of ice on 
Jupiter and Saturn?" 

"Not that specifically, but it 
is water, you'll admit. A thousand-mile-thick layer of water is 
a lot of water." 

"But it's all covered up with 
layers of ammonia or — or something, isn't it?" asked Swenson. 
"Besides, we can't land on the 
major planets." 



"I know that." said Long, "but 
I haven't said that was the answer. The major planets aren't 
the only objects out there. What 
about the asteroids and the satellites? Vesta is a two-hundredmile-diameter asteroid that's 
hardly more than a chunk of ice. 
One of the moons of Saturn is 
mostly ice. How about that?" 

Rioz said, "Haven't you ever 
been in space, Ted?" 

"You know I have. Why do 
you ask?" 

"Sure, I know you have, but 
you still talk like a Grounder. 
Have you thought of the distances involved? The average 
asteroid is a hundred twenty million miles from Mars at the 
closest. That's twice the VenusMars hop and you know that 
hardly any liners do even that 
in one jump. They usually stop 
off at Earth or the Moon. After 
all, how long do you expect anyone to stay in space, man?" 

"I don't know. What's your 
limit?" 

"You know the limit. You don't 
have to ask me. It's six months. 
That's handbook data. After six 
months, if you're still in space, 
you're psychotherapy meat. 
Right, Dick?" 

Swenson nodded. 

"And that's just the asteroids." 
Rioz went on. "From Mars to 
Jupiter is three hundred thirty 
million miles, and to Saturn it's 



22 




 



seven hundred million. How can 
anyone hand-le that kind of distance? Suppose you hit standard 
velocity or to make it even, say 
you get up to a good two hundred 
kilomiles an hour. It would take 
you — let's see, allowing time for 
acceleration and deceleration — 
about six or seven months to get 
to Jupiter and nearly a year to 
get to Saturn. Of course, you 
could hike the speed to a million 
miles an hour, theoretically, but 
where would you get the water to 
do that?" 

"Gee," said a small voice, attached to a smutty nose and 
round eyes, "Saturn!" 

Dora whirled in her chair. 
"Peter, march right back into 
your room!" 

"Aw, Ma." 

"Don't 'aw, Ma' me." She began to get out of the chair, and 
Peter scuttled away. 

Swenson said, "Say, Dora, why 
don't you keep him company for 
a while? It's hard to keep his 
mind on homework if we're all 
out here talking." 

Dora sniffed obstinately and 
stayed put, "I'll sit right here 
until I find out what Ted Long 
is thinking of. I tell you right 
now I don't like the sound of it." 

C WENSON said , nervously . 
^ "Well, never mind Jupiter 
and Saturn. I'm sure Ted isn't 
figuring on that. But what about 



Vesta? We could make it in ten 
or twelve weeks there and the 
same back. And two hundred 
miles in diameter. That's four 
million cubic miles of icef" 

"So what?" said Rioz. "What 
do we do on Vesta? Quarry the 
ice? Set up mining machinery? 
Say, do you know how long that 
would take?" 

Long said, "I'm talking about 
Saturn, not Vesta." 

Rioz addressed an unseen audience. "I tell him seven hundred 
million miles and he keeps on 
talking." 

"All right," said Long, "suppose you tell me how you know 
we can only stay in space six 
months, Mario?" 

"It's common knowledge, damn 
it." 

"Because it's in the Handbook 
of Space Flight. It's data compiled by Earth scientists from experience with Earth pilots and 
spacemen. You're stilt thinking 
Grounder style. You won't think 
the Martian way." 

"A Martian may be a Martian, but he's still a man." 

"But how can you be so blind? 
How many times have you fellows been out for over six months 
without a break?" 

Rioz said, "That's different.'* 
' "Because you're Martians? Because you're professional Scavengers?" 

"No. Because we're not on a 



THE m\ R T I AN WAY 



flight. We can put back for Mars 
any time we want to." 

"But you don'r want to. That's 
my point. Earthmen have tremendous ships with libraries of films, 
with a crew of fifteen plus passengers. Still, they can only stay 
out six months maximum. Martian Scavengers have a two room 
ship with only one partner. But 
we can stick it out more than 
six months." 

r\ORA said, "I suppose you 
want to stay in a ship for a 
year and go to Saturn." 

"Why not, Dora?" said Long. 
"We can do it. Don't you see we 
can? Earthmen can't. They've got 
a real world. They've got open 
sky and fresh food, all the air 
and water they want. Getting into 
a ship is a terrible change for 
them. More than six months is 
too much for them for that very 
reason. Martians are different. 
We've been living on a ship our 
entire lives. 

"That's all Mars is — a ship. 
It's just a big ship forty-five hundred miles across with one tiny 
room in it occupied by fifty thousand people. It's closed in like a 
ship. We breathe packaged air 
and drink packaged water which 
we repurify over and over. We eat 
the same food-rations we eat 
aboard ship. When we get into 
a ship, it's the same thing we've 
known all our lives. We can stand 



it for a lot more than a year if 
we have to." 

Dora said, "Dick, too?" 

"We all can." 

"Well, Dick can't. It's all very 
well for you. Ted Long, and this 
shell-stealer here, this Mario, to 
talk about jaunting off for a year. 
You're not married. Dick is. He 
has a wife and he has a child and 
that's enough for him. He can just 
get a regular job right here on 
Mars. Why. my goodness, suppose you go to Saturn and find 
there's no water there. How'll you 
get back? Even if you had water 
left, you'd be out of food. It's the 
most ridiculous thing I ever heard 
of." 

"No. Now listen," said Long, 
tightly. "I've thought this thing 
out. I've talked to Commissioner 
Sankov and he'll help. But we've 
got to have ships and men. I can't 
get them. The men won't listen 
to me. I'm green. You two are 
known and respected. You're veterans. If you back me, even if 
you don't go yourselves, if you'll 
just help me sell this thing to 
the rest, get volunteers — " 

"First," said Rioz. grumpily, 
"you'll have to do a lot more 
explaining. Once we get to Saturn, 
where's the water?" 

"That's the beauty of it," said 
Long. "That's why it's got to be 
Saturn. The water there is just 
floating around in space for the 
taking."

V 

M/HEN Hamish Sankov had 
come to Mars, there was no 
such thing as a native Martian. 
Now there were two-hundred-odd 
babies whose grandfathers had 
been born on Mars — natives in 
the third generation. 

When he had come as a boy in 
his teens, Mars had been scarcely 
more than a huddle of grounded 
spaceships connected by sealed 
underground tunnels, Through 
the years, he had seen buildings 
grow and burrow widely, thrusting blunt snouts up into the thin, 
unbreathable atmosphere. He had 
seen huge storage depots spring 
up into which spaceships and 
their loads could be swallowed 
whole. He had seen the mines 
grow from nothing to a huge 
gouge in the Martian crust, while 
the population of Mars grew from 
fifty to fifty thousand. 

It made him feel old, these long 
memories — they and the even 
dimmer memories induced by the 
presence of this Earthman before 
him. His visitor brought up those 
long-forgotten scraps of thought 
about a soft-warm world that was 
as kind and gentle to mankind as 
the mother's womb. 

The Earthman seemed fresh 
from that womb. Not very tall, 
not very lean; in fact, distinctly 
plump. Dark hair with a neat 
little wave in it, a neat little mus


tache and neatly scrubbed skin. 
His clothing was right in style 
and as fresh and neatly turned as 
plastek could be. 

Sankov's own clothes were of 
Martian manufacture, serviceable 
and clean, but many years behind 
the times. His face was craggy 
and lined, his hair was pure white 
and his Adam's apple wobbled 
when he talked. 

The Earthman was Myron 
Digby, member of Earth's General Assembly. Sankov was Martian Commissioner. 

Sankov said, "This all hits us 
hard, Assemblyman." 

"It's hit most of us hard, too. 
Commissioner." 

"Uh-huh. Can't honestly say 
then that I can make it out. Of 
course, you understand, I don't 
make out that I can understand 
Earth ways, for all that I was 
born there. Mars is a hard place 
to live, Assemblyman, and you 
have to understand that. It takes 
a lot of shipping space just to 
bring us food, water, and raw materials so we can live. There's not 
much room left for books and 
news-films. Even video programs 
can't reach Mars, except for 
about a month when Earth is in 
conjunction, and even then nobody has much time to listen. 

"My office gets a weekly summary film from Planetary Press. 
Generally, I don't have time to 
pay attention to it. Maybe you'd 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



25 



call us provincial, and you'd be 
right. When something like this 
happens, all we can do is kind 
of helplessly look at each other." 

Digby said, slowly, "You can't 
mean that your people on Mars 
haven't heard of Hilder's antiWaster campaign." 

"No, can't exactly say that. 
There's a young Scavenger, son 
of a good friend of mine who died 
in space — " Sankov scratched the 
side of his neck doubtfully — "who 
makes a hobby out of reading up 
on Earth history and things like 
that. He catches video broadcasts when he's out in space and 
he listened to this man Hilder. 
Near as I can make out, that was 
the first talk Hilder made about 
Wasters. 

"Jhe young fellow came to me 
with that. Naturally, I didn't take 
him very serious. I kept an eye 
on the .Planetary Press films for 
a while after that, but there 
wasn't much mention of Hilder 
and what there was made him out 
to look pretty funny." 

"Yes, Commissioner," said Digby, "it all seemed quite a joke 
when it started." 

OANKOV stretched out a pair 
^ of long legs to one side of his 
desk and crossed them at the 
ankles. "Seems to me it's still 
pretty much of a joke. What's his 
argument? We're using up water. 
Has he tried looking at some fig


ures? I got them all here. Had 
them brought to me when this 
committee arrived. 

"Seems that Earth has four 
hundred million cubic miles of 
water in its oceans and each cubic 
mile weighs four and a half billion tons. That's a lot of water. 
Now we use some of that heap in 
space flight. Most of the thrust 
is inside Earth's gravitational 
field, and that means the water 
thrown out finds its way back to 
the oceans. Hilder doesn't figure 
that in. When he says a million 
tons of water is used up per flight, 
he's a liar. It's less than a hundred thousand tons. 

"Suppose, now, we have fifty 
thousand flights a year. We don't, 
of course; not even fifteen hundred. But let's say there are 
fifty thousand. I figura there's going to be considerable expansion 
as time goes on. With fifty thousand flights, one cubic mile of 
water would be lost to space each 
year. That means that in a million years Earth would lose onequarter of one per cent of its total 
water supply!" 

Digby spread his hands, palms 
upward, and let them drop. 
"Commissioner, Interplanetary 
Alloys has used figures like that 
in their campaign against Hilder, 
but you can't fight a tremendous, 
emotion-filled drive with cold 
mathematics. This man Hilder 
has invented a name, 'Wasters.' 



26 




 



Slowly, he has built this name 
up into a gigantic conspiracy ; 
a gang of brutal profit-seeking 
wretches raping Earth for their 
own immediate benefit, 

"He has accused the government of being riddled with them, 
the Assembly of being dominated 
by them, the press of being owned 
by them. None of this, unfortunately, seems ridiculous to the 
average man. He knows all too 
well what selfish men can do to 
Earth's resources. He knows what 
happened to Earth's oil during 
the Time of Troubles, for instance, and the way topsoil was 
ruined. 

"When a farmer experiences a 
drought, he doesn't care that the 
amount of water lost in space 
flight isn't a droplet in a fog as 
far as Earth's overall water supply is concerned. Hilder has given 
him something to blame and 
that's the strongest possible consolation for disaster. He isn't going to give that up for a diet of 
figures." 

Sankov said, "That's where I 
get puzzled. Maybe it's because 
I don't know how things work on 
Earth, but it seems to me that 
there aren't just droughty farmers 
there. As near as I could make 
out from the news summaries, 
these Hilder people are a minority. Why is it Earth goes along 
with a few farmers and some 
crackpots that egg them on?" 



"Because, Commissioner, there 
are such things as worried human 
beings. The steel industry sees 
that an era of space flight will 
stress increasingly the light nonferrous alloys. The various 
miners' unions worry about extraterrestrial competition. Any 
Earthman who can't get aluminum to ljuild a pre-fab is certain 
that it is because the aluminum 
is going to Mars. I know a professor of archaeology who's an 
anti-Waster because he can't get 
a government grant to cover his 
excavations. He's convinced that 
all government money is going into rocketry research and space 
medicine and he resents it." 

Sankov said, "That doesn't 
sound like Earth people are much 
different from us here on Mars. 
But what about the General Assembly? Why do they have to 
go along with Hilder?" 

"pwlGBY smiled sourly. "Politics 
isn't pleasant to explain. Hilder introduced this bill to set up 
a committee to investigate waste 
in space flight. Maybe threefourths or more of the General 
Assembly was against such an investigation as an intolerable and 
useless extension of bureaucracy 
— which it is. But then how could 
any legislator be against a mere 
investigation of waste? It would 
sound as though he had something to fear or to conceal. It 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



27 



would sound as though he were 
himself profiting from waste. Hilder is not in the least afraid of 
making such accusations, and 
whether true or not, they would 
be a powerful factor with the 
voters in the next election. The 
bill passed. 

"And then there came the question of appointing the members 
of the committee. Those who were 
against Hilder shied away from 
membership, which would have 
meant decisions that would be 
continually embarrassing. Remaining on the sidelines would 
make that one that much less a 
target for Hilder. The result is 
that I am the only member of 
the committee who is outspokenly 
anti-Hilder and it may cost me 
re -election." 

Sankov said, "I'd be sorry to 
see that, Assemblyman. It looks 
as though Mars didn't have as 
many friends as we thought we 
had. We wouldn't like to lose one. 
But if Hilder wins out, what's 
he after, anyway?" 

"I should think," said Digby. 
"that that is obvious. He wants 
to be the next Global Coordinator." ' 

"Think he'll make it?" 

"If nothing happens to stop 
him, he will." 

"And then what? Will he drop 
this Waster campaign then?" 

"I can't say. I don't know if 
he's laid his plans past the Co


ordinacy. Still, if you want my 
guess, he couldn't abandon the 
campaign and maintain his popularity. It's gotten out of hand." 

Sankov scratched the side of his 
neck. "All right. In that case, 
I'll ask you for some advice. 
What can we folks on Mars do? 
You know Earth. You know the 
situation. We don't. Tell us what 
to do." 

Digby rose and stepped to the 
window. He looked out upon the 
low domes of other buildings; 
red, rocky, completely desolate 
plain in between; a purple sky 
and a shrunken sun. 

He said, without turning. "Do 
you people really like it on 
Mars?" 

Sankov smiled. "Most of us 
don't exactly know any other 
world, Assemblyman. Seems to 
me Earth would be something 
queer and uncomfortable to 
them." 

"But wouldn't Martians get 
used to it? Earth' isn't hard to 
take after this. Wouldn't your 
people learn to enjoy the privilege 
of breathing air under an open 
sky? You once lived on Earth. 
You remember what it was like." 

"I sort of remember. Still, it 
doesn't seem to be easy to explain. 
Earth is just there. It fits* people 
and people fit it. People take 
Earth the way they find it. Mars 
is different. It's sort of raw and 
doesn't fit people. People got to 



28 




 



make something out of it. They 
got to build a world, and not take 
what they find. Mars isn't much 
yet, but we're building and when 
we're finished, we're going to have 
just what we like. It's sort of a 
great feeling to know you're 
building a world. Earth would be 
kind of unexciting after that." 

T^HE Assemblyman said, "Surely the ordinary Martian isn't 
such a philosopher that he's content to live this terribly hard 
life for the sake of a future that 
must be hundreds of generations 
away." 

"No-o, not just like that." Sankov put his right ankle on his 
left knee and cradled it as he 
spoke. "Like I said, Martians are 
a lot like Earthmen, which means 
they're sort of human beings, and 
human beings don't go in for philosophy much. Just the same, 
there's something to living in a 
growing world, whether you think 
about it much or not. 

"My father used to send me 
letters when I first carne to Mars. 
He was an accountant and he 
just sort of stayed an accountant. 
Earth wasn't much different when 
he died from what it was when 
he was born. He didn't see anything happen. Every day was like 
every other day, and living was 
just a way of passing time until 
he died. 

"On Mars, it's different. Every 



day there's something new — the 
city's bigger, the ventilation system gets another kick, the water 
lines from the poles get slicked 
up. Right now, we're planning to 
set up a news-film association of 
our own. We're going to call it 
Mars Press. If you haven't lived 
when things are growing all about 
you, you'll never understand how 
wonderful it feels. 

"No, Assemblyman, Mars is 
hard and tough and Earth is a 
lot more comfortable, but seems 
to me, if you take our boys to 
Earth, they'll be unhappy. They 
probably wouldn't be able to figure out why, most of them, but 
they'd feel lost; lost and useless. Seems to me lots of them 
would never make the adjustment." 

Digby turned away from the 
window and the smooth, pink 
skin of his forehead was creased 
into a frown. "In that case, Commissioner, I am sorry for you. For 
all of you." 

"Why?" 

"Because I don't think there's 
anything your people on Mars 
can do. Or the people on the 
Moon or Venus. It won't happen 
now; maybe it won't happen for 
a year or two, or even for five 
years. But pretty soon you'll all 
have to come back to Earth, unless — " 

Sankov's white eyebrows bent 
low over his eyes. "Well?" 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



29 



"Unless you can find another 
source of water besides the planet 
Earth." 

Sankov shook his head. "Don't 
seem likely, does it?" 
"Not very." 

"And except for that, seems 
to you there's no chance?" 
"None at all.'" 

Digby said that and left, and 
Sankov stared for a long time 
at nothing before he punched a 
combination of the local communi-line. 

After a while, Ted Long looked 
out at him. 

Sankov said, "You were right, 
son. There's nothing they can do. 



Even the ones that mean well see 
no way out. How did you know?" 

"Commissioner," said Long, 
"when you've read all you can 
about the Time of Troubles, particularly about the twentieth century, nothing political can come 
as a real surprise." 

"Well, maybe. Anyway, son, 
Assemblyman Digby is sorry for 
us, quite a piece sorry, you might 
say, but that's all. He says we'll 
have to leave Mars— or else get 
water somewhere else. Only he 
thinks that we can't get water 
somewhere else." 

"You know we can, don't you, 
Commissioner?"

"I know we mi&ht, son. It's a 
terrible risk." 

"If I find enough volunteers, 
the risk is our business." 

"How is it going?" 

"Not bad. Some of the boys 
are on my side right now. I talked 
Mario Rioz into it, for instance, 
and you know he's one of the 
best." 

"That's just it — the volunteers 
will be the best men we have. 
I hate to allow it." 

"If we get back, it will be worth 
it." 

"If! It's a big word, son." 
"And a big thing we're trying 
to do." 



"Well, I gave my word that if 
there was no help on Earth, I'll 
see that the Phobos water-hole

HALF a million miles above 
Saturn, Mario Rioz was 
cradled on nothing and sleep was 
delicious. He came out of it slowly and for a while, alone in his 
suit, he counted the stars and 
traced lines from one to another. 

At first, as the weeks flew past, 
it was .scavenging all over again, 
except for the gnawing feeling

that tvtry minute meant an additional number of thousands of 
miles away from all humanity. 
That made it worse. 

They had aimed high to pass 
out of the ecliptic while moving 
through the Asteroid Belt. That 
had used up water and had probably been unnecessary. Although 
tens of thousands of worldlets 
look as thick as vermin in twodimensional projection upon a 
photographic plate, they are 
nevertheless scatteted so thinly 
through the quadrillions of cubic 
miles that make up their conglomerate orbit that only the 
most ridiculous of coincidences 
would have brought about a collision. 

* Still, they passed over the Belt 
and someone calculated the 
chances of collision with a fragment of matter large enough to 
do damage. The value was so low, 
so impossibly low. that it was 
perhaps inevitable that the notion 
of the "space-float" should occur 
to someone. 

The days were long and many, 
space was empty, only one man 
was needed at the controls at any 
one time. The thought was a 
natural. 

First, it was a particularly daring one who ventured out for fifteen minutes or so. Then another 
who tried half an hour. Eventually, before the asteroids were 
entirely behind, each ship regu32 G 



larly had its off-watch member 
suspended in space at the end 
of a cable. 

It was easy enough. The cable, 
one of those intended for operations at the conclusion of their 
journey, was magnetically attached at both ends, one to the 
spacesuit to start with. Then you 
clambered out the lock onto the 
ship's hull and attached the other 
end there. You paused a while, 
clinging to the metal skin by the 
electro-magnets in your boots. 
Then you neutralized those *and 
made the slightest muscular effort. 

Slowly, ever so slowly, you 
lifted from the ship and even 
more slowly the ship's larger mass 
moved an equivalently shorter 
distance downward. You floated 
incredibly, weightlessly, in solid, 
speckled black. When the ship 
had moved far enough away from 
you. your gauntleted hand, which 
kept touch upon the cable, tightened its grip slightly. Too tightly, and you would begin moving 
back toward the ship and it 
toward you. Just tightly enough, 
and friction would halt you. Because your motion was equivalent to that of the ship, it seemed 
as motionless below you as 
though it had been painted 
against an impossible background 
while the cable between you hung 
in coils that had no reason to 
straighten out. 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It was a ship to your eye. One 
half was lit by the light of the 
feeble Sun, which was still too 
bright to look at directly without 
the heavy protection of the polarized spacesuit visor. The other 
half was black on black, invisible. 

Space closed in and it was like 
sleep. Your suit was warm, it 
renewed its air automatically, it 
had food and drink in special 
containers from which it could be 
sucked with a minimal motion of 
the head, it took care of wastes 
appropriately. Most of all, more 
than anything else, there was the 
delightful euphoria of weightlessness. 

You never felt so well in your 
life. The days stopped being too 
long, they weren't long enough, 
and there weren't enough of them. 

THEY had passed Jupiter's orbit at a spot some thirty degrees from its then position. For 
months it was the brightest object in the sky, always excepting 
the glowing white pea that 
was the Sun. At its brightest, 
some of the Scavengers insisted 
they could make out Jupiter as a 
tiny sphere, one side squashed 
out of true by the night-shadow. 

Then over a period of additional months it faded, while another dot of light grew until it 
was brighter than Jupiter. It was 
Saturn, first as a dot of brilliance, 
then as an oval, glowing splotch. 



("Why oval?" someone asked 
and after a while someone else 
said, "The rings, of course," and 
it was obvious.) 

Everyone space-floated at all 
possible times toward the end, 
watching Saturn incessantly. 

("Hey, you jerk, come on back 
in, damn it. You're on duty." 
"Who's on duty? I've got fifteen 
minutes more by my watch." 
"You set your watch back. Besides, I gave you twenty minutes 
yesterday." "You wouldn't give 
two minutes to your grandmother." "Come on in, damn it, 
or I'm coming out anyway." "All 
right, I'm coming. Holy howlers, 
what a racket over a lousy minute." But no quarrel could possibly be serious; not in space. It 
felt too good.) 

Saturn grew until at last it 
rivaled and then surpassed the 
Sun. The rings, set at a broad 
angle to their trajectory of approach, swept grandly about the 
planet, only a small portion being eclipsed. Then, as they approached, the span of the rings 
grew still wider, yet narrower as 
the angle of approach constantly 
decreased. 

The larger moons showed up 
in the surrounding sky like serene 
fireflies. 

Mario Rioz was glad he was 
awake so that he could watch 
again. 

Saturn filled half the sky, 



THE MARTIAN WAY

streaked with orange, the night 
shadow cutting it fuzzily nearly 
one-quarter of Hhe way in from 
the right. Two round little dotsin the brightness were shadows of 
two of the moons. To the left 
and behind him (he could look 
over his left shoulder to see, and 
as he did so, the rest of his body 
inched slightly to the right to 
conserve angular momentum) 
was the white diamond of the 
Sun. 

Most of all he liked to watch 
the rings. At the left, they 
emerged from behind Saturn, a 
tight, bright triple band of orange 
light. At the right, their beginnings were hidden in the night 
shadow, but showed up closer and 
broader. They widened as they 
came, like the flare of a horn, 
growing hazier as they approached, until, while the eye followed them, they seemed to fill 
the sky and lose themselves. 

From the position of the Scavenger fleet just inside the outer 
rim of the outermost ring, the 
rings broke up and assumed 
their true identity as a phenomenal cluster of solid fragments 
rather than the tight, solid band 
of light they seemed. 

Below him, or rather in, the 
direction his feet pointed, some 
twenty miles away, was one of 
the ring fragments. It looked like 
a large irregular splotch, marring 
the symmetry of space, three


quarters in brightness and the 
night shadow cutting it like a 
knife. Other fragments were 
farther off, sparkling like stardust, dimmer and thicker, until, 
as you followed them down, they 
became rings once more. 

The fragments were motionless, but that was only because 
the ships had taken up an orbit 
about Saturn equivalent to that 
of the outer edge of the rings. 

THE day before, Rioz reflected, 
he had been on that nearest 
fragment, working along with 
more than a score of others to 
mold it into the desired shape. 
Tomorrow, he would be at it 
again. 

Today — today he was spacefloating. 

"Mario?" The voice that broke 
upon his ear-phones was questioning. 

Momentarily, Rioz was flooded 
with annoyance. Damn it, he 
wasn't in the mood for company. 

"Speaking," he said. 

"I thought I had your ship 
spotted. How are you?" 

"Fine. That you, Ted?" 

"That's right," said Long. 

"Anything wrong on the fragment?" 

"Nothing. I'm out here floating." 
"You?" 

"It gets me, too, occasionally. 
Beautiful, isn't it?" * 



34 




 



"Nice," agreed Rioz. 

"You know, I've read Earth 
books — " 

"Grounder books, you mean." 
Rioz yawned and found it difficult under the circumstances to 
use the expression with the 
proper amount of resentment. 

" — and sometimes I read descriptions of people lying on 
grass," continued Long. "You 
know, that green stuff like thin 
long pieces of paper they have 
all over the ground down there, 
and they look up at the blue sky 
with clouds in it. Did you ever 
see any films of that?" 

"Sure. It didn't attract me. It 
looked cold." 

"I suppose it isn't, though. After 
all. Earth is quite close to the Sun 
and they say their atmosphere 
is thick enough to hold the heat. 
I must admit that personally I 
would hate to be caught under 
open sky with nothing on but 
clothes. Still, I imagine they 
like it." 

"Grounders are nuts!" 
^ "They talk about the trees, big 
brown stalks, and the winds, air 
movements, you know." 

"You mean drafts. They can 
keep that, too." 

"It doesn't matter. The point 
is they describe it beautifully, almost passionately. Many times 
I've wondered, 'What's it really 
like? Will I ever feel it or is this 
something only Earthmen can 



possibly feel?' I've felt so often 
that I was missing something 
vital. Now I know what it must 
be like. It's this. Complete peace 
in the middle of a beauty drenched universe." 

RIOZ said, "They wouldn't like 
it. The Grounders, I mean. 
They're so used to their own 
lousy little world, they wouldn't 
appreciate what it's like to float 
and look down on Saturn." He 
flipped his body slightly and began swaying back and forth about 
his center of mass, slowly, soothingly. 

Long said, "Yes, I think so, 
too. They're slaves to their planet. 
Even if they come to Mars, it 
will only be their children that 
are free. There'll be starships 
someday; great, huge things that 
can carry thousands of people 
and maintain its self-contained 
equilibrium for decades, maybe 
centuries. Mankind will spread 
through the whole Galaxy. But 
people will have to live their 
lives out on shipboard until new 
methods of interstellar travel are 
developed, so it will be Martians, 
not planet-bound Earthmen, who 
will colonize the Universe. That's 
inevitable. It's got to be. It's 
the Martian way." 

But Rioz made no answer. He 
had dropped off to sleep again, 
rocking and swaying gently, half 
a million miles above Saturn. 



THE MARTIAN WAY

VII 

TpHE work-shift of the ringfragment was the tail of the 
coin. The weightlessness, peace 
and privacy of the space-float 
gave place to something that had 
neither peace nor privacy. Even 
the weightlessness, which continued, became more a purgatory 
than a paradise under the new 
conditions. 

Try to manipulate an ordinarily non-portable heat projector. It 
could be lifted, despite the fact 
that it was six feet high and wide 
and almost solid metal, since it 
only weighed a fraction of an 
ounce. But its inertia was exactly 
what it had always been, which 
meant that if it wasn't moved 
into position very slowly, it would 
jutt keep on going, taking you 
with it. Then you would have to 
hike the pseudo-grav field of your 
suit and come down with a jar. 

Keralski had hiked the field a 
little too high and he came down 
a little too roughly, with the projector coming down with him at 
a dangerous angle. His crushed 
ankle had been the first casualty 
of the expedition. 

Rioz was swearing fluently and 
nearly continuously. He continued to have the impulse to 
drag the back of his hand across 
his forehead in order to wipe 
away the accumulating sweat. 
The few times that he had suc


cumbed to the impulse, metal 
had met silicone with a clash that 
rang loudly inside his suit, but 
served no useful purpose. The 
desiccators within the suit were 
sucking at maximum and, of 
course, recovering the water and 
restoring ion-exchanged liquid, 
containing a careful proportion of 
salt, into the appropriate receptacle. 

Rioz yelled, "Damn it, Dick, 
wait till I give the word, will 
you?" 

And Swenson's voice rang in 
his ears, "Well, how long am I 
supposed to sit here?" 

"Till I say," replied Rioz. 

He strengthened pseudo-grav 
and lifted the projector a bit. He 
released pseudo-grav, insuring 
that the projector would stay in 
place for minutes even if he 
withdrew support altogether. He 
kicked the cable out of the way 
(it stretched beyond the close 
"horizon" to a power source that 
was out of sight) and touched the 
release. 

The material of which the fragment was composed bubbled and 
vanished under its touch. A section of the lip of the tremendous 
cavity he had already carved into 
its substance melted away and a 
roughness in its contour had disappeared. 

"Try it now," called Rioz. 

Swenson was in the ship that 




 



was hovering nearly over Rioz's 
head. 

Swenson called, "All clear?" 
"I told you to go ahead." 

IT was a feeble flicker of steam 
that issued from one of the 
ship's forward vents. The ship 
drifted down toward the ringfragment. Another flicker adjusted a tendency to drift sidewise. 
It came down straight. 

A third flicker to the rear slowed it to a feather-rate. 

Rioz watched tensely. "Keep 
her coming. You'll make it. 
You'll make it." 

The rear of the ship entered the 
hole, nearly filling it. The bellying walls came closer and closer 
to its rim. There was a grinding 
vibration as the ship's motion 
halted. 

It was Swenson's turn to curse. 
"It doesn't fit," he said. 

Rioz threw the projector 
groundward in a passion and 
went flailing up into space. The 
projector kicked up a white crystalline dust all about it, and when 
Rioz came down under pseudograv, he did the same. 

He said, "You went in on the 
bias, you dumb Grounder." 

"I hit it level, you dirt-eating 
farmer." 

Backward-pointing side jets of 
the ship were blasting more 
strongly than before, and Rioz 
hopped to get out of the way. 



The ship scraped up from the 
pit, then shot into space half a 
mile before forward jets could 
bring it to a halt. 

Swenson said tensely, "We'll 
spring half a dozen plates if we 
do this once again. Get it right, 
will you?" 

"I'll get it right. Don't worry 
about it. Just you come in right." 

Rioz jumped upward and allowed himself to climb three hundred yards to get an overall look 
at the cavity. The gouge-marks 
of the ship were plain enough. 
They were concentrated at one 
point, halfway down the pit. He 
would get that. 

It began to melt outward under 
the blaze of the projector. 

Half an hour later, the ship 
snuggled neatly into its cavity, 
and Swenson, wearing his spacesuit, emerged to join Rioz. 

Swenson said, "If you want to 
step in and climb out of the suit, 
I'll take care of the icing." 

"It's all right," said Rioz. "I'd 
just as soon sit here and watch 
Saturn." 

He sat down at the Hp of the 
pit. There was a six-foot gap between it and the ship. In some 
places about the circle, it was two 
feet, in a few places even merely 
a matter of inches. You couldn't 
expect a better fit out of handwork. The final adjustment 
would be made by steaming ice 
gently and letting it freeze into 



THE -MARTIAN WAY 



the cavity between the lip and 
the ship. 

SATURN moved visibly across 
the sky, its vast bulk inching 
below the horizon. 

Rioz said, "How many ships 
are left to put in place?" 

Swenson said, "Last I heard, it 
was eleven. We*re in now, so that 
means only ten. Seven of the ones 
that are placed are iced in. Two 
or three are dismantled." 
"We're coming along fine." 
"There's plenty to do yet. Don't 
forget the main jets at the other 
end. And the cables and the power lines. Sometimes I wonder if 
we'll make it< On the way out, it 
didn't bother me so much, but 
just now I was sitting at the controls and I was saying: 'We won't 
make it. We'll sit out here and 
starve and die with nothing but 
Saturn over us.' It makes me 
feel—" 

He didn't explain how it made 
him feel. He just sat there. 

Rioz said, "You think too 
damn much." 

"It's different with you," said 
Swenson. "I keep thinking of 
Pete — and Dora." 

"What for? She said you could 
go, didn't she? The Commissioner gave her that talk on patriotism and how you'd be a hero and 
set for life once you got back, and 
she said you could go. You didn't 
sneak out the way Adams did." 



"Adams is different. That wife 
of his should have been shot 
when she was born. Some women 
can make hell for a guy, can't 
they? She didn't want him to go 
— But she'd probably rather he 
didn't come back if she can get 
his settlement pay " 

"Whaf s your kick, then? Dora 
wants you back, doesn't she?" 

Swenson sighed. "I never treated her right." 

"You turned over your pay, it 
seems to me. I wouldn't do that 
for any woman. Money for value 
received, not a cent more." 
" "Money isn't it. I get to thinking out here. A woman likes 
company. A kid needs his father. 
What am I doing way out here?" 

"Getting set to go home." 

"Ah-h, you don't understand." 

VIII 

rpED LONG wandered over the 
ridged surface of the ringfragment with his spirits as icy 
as the ground he walked on. It 
had all seemed perfectly logical 
back on Mars, but that was Mars. 
He had worked it out carefully 
in his mind in perfectly reasonable steps. He could still remember exactly how it went. 

It didn't take a ton of water to 
move a ton of ship. It was not 
mass equals mass, but mass times 
velocity equals mass times velocity. It didn't matter, in other 



38 




 

I 



words, whether you shot out a 
ton of water at a mile a second 
or a hundred pounds of water at 
twenty miles a second. You got 
the same final velocity out of the 
ship. 

That meant the jet nozzles had 
to be made narrower and the 
steam hotter. But then drawbacks 
appeared. The narrower the nozzle, the more energy was lost in 
friction and turbulence. The hotter the steam, the more refractory 
the nozzle had to be and the 
shorter its. life. The limit in that 
direction was quickly reached. 

Then, since a given weight pf 
water could move considerably 
more than its own weight under 
the narrow-nozzle conditions, it 
paid to be big. The bigger the 
water-storage space, the larger 
the size of the actual travel-head, 
even in proportion. So they started to make liners heavier and 
bigger. But then the larger the 
shell, the heavier the bracings, 
the more difficult the weldings, 
the more exacting the engineering 
requirements. At the moment, the 
limit in that direction had been 
reached also. 

And then he had put his finger 
on what had seemed to him to be 
the basic flaw — the original, unswervable conception that the 
fuel had to be placed inside the 
ship; that metal had to be built 
to encircle a million tons of 
water. 



Why? Water did not have to be 
water. It could be ice, and ice 
could be shaped. Holes could be 
melted into it. Travel-heads and 
jets could be fitted into it. Cables 
could hold travel-heads and jets 
stiffly together under the influence 
of magnetic field -force grips. 

Long felt the trembling of the 
ground he walked on. He was at 
the head of the fragment. A dozen ships were blasting in and out 
of sheaths carved in its substance, and the fragment shuddered under the continuing impact. 

THE ice didn't have to be quarried. It existed in proper 
chunks in the rings of Saturn. 
That's all the rings were — pieces 
of nearly pure ice, circling Saturn. So spectroscopy stated and 
so it had turned out to be. He was 
standing on one such piece now, 
over two miles long, nearly one 
mile thick. It was almost half a 
billion tons of water, all in one 
piece, and he was standing on it. 

But now he was face to face 
with the realities of life. He had 
never told the men just how 
quickly he had expected to set up 
the fragment as a ship, but in his 
heart, he had imagined it would 
be two days. It was a week now 
and he didn't.dare to estimate 
the remaining time. He no longer 
even had any confidence that the 
task was a possible one. Would 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



39 



they be able to control jets with 
enough delicacy through leads 
slung across two miles of ice, to 
manipulate out of Saturn's dragging gravity? 

Drinking water was low, 
though they could always distill 
more out of the ice. Still, the food 
stores were not in a good way, 
either. 

T¥E paused, looked up into the 
sky, eyes straining. Was the 
object growing larger? He ought 
to measure its distance. Actually, 
he lacked the spirit to add that 
trouble to the others. His mind 
slid back to greater immediacies. 

Morale, at least, was high. The 
men seemed to enjoy being out 
Saturn-way. They were the first 
humans to penetrate this far, the 
firs^ to pass the asteroids, the 
first to see Jupiter like a glowing 
pebble to the naked eye, the first 
to see Saturn — like that. 

He didn't think fifty practical, 
case-hardened, shell-snatching 
Scavengers would take time to 
feel that sort of emotion. But they 
did. And they were proud. 

Two men and a half-buried 
ship slid up the moving horizon 
as he walked. 

He called , crisply , "Hello , 
there!" 

Rioz answered, /'That you, 
Ted?" . 

"You bet. Is that Dick with 
you?" 



"S.ure. Come on, sit down. We 
were just getting ready to ice in 
and we were looking for an excuse to delay." 

"I'm not," said Swenson, 
promptly. "When will we be 
leaving, Ted?" 

"As soon as we get through. 
That's no answer, is it?" 

Swenson said, dispiritedly, "I 
suppose there isn't any other 
answer." 

Long looked up, staring at the 
irregular bright splotch in the 
sky. 

Rioz followed his glance. 
"What's the matter?" 

For a moment. Long did not 
reply. The sky was black otherwise and the ring fragments were 
an orange dust against it. Saturn 
was more than three-fourths below the horizon and the rings 
were going with it. Half a mile 
away, a ship bounded past the 
icy rim of the planetoid into the 
sky, was orange-lit by Saturnlight, and sank down again. 

The ground trembled gently. 

Rioz said, "Something bothering you about the shadow?" 

They called it that. It was the 
nearest fragment of the rings, 
quite close considering that they 
were at the outer rim of the rings, 
where the pieces spread themselves relatively thin. It was perhaps twenty miles off, a jagged 
mountain, its shape clearly visible. 



40 




 



"How does it look to you?" 
asked Long. 

Rioz shrugged. "Okay, I guess. 
I don't see anything wrong." 

"Doesn't it seem to be getting 
larger?" 

"Why should it?" 

"Well, doesn't it?" Long insisted. 

RIOZ and Swenson stared at it 
thoughtfully. 
"It does look bigger," said 
Swenson. 

"You're just putting the notion 
into our minds," Rioz argued. 
"If it were getting bigger, it 
would be coming closer." 

"What's impossible about 
that?" 

"These things are unstable orbits." 

"They were when we came 
here," said Long. "There, did you 
feel that?" 

The ground had trembled 
again. 

Long said, "We've been blasting this thing for a week now. 
First, twenty-five ships landed 
on it, which changed its momentum right there. Not much, of 
course. Then we've been melting 
parts of it away and our ships 
have been blasting in and out of 
it— all at one end, too. In a week, 
we may have changed its orbit 
just a bit. The two fragments, 
this one and the Shadow, might 
be converging." 



"It's got plenty of room to miss 
us in." Rioz watched it thoughtfully. "Besides, if we can't even 
tell for sure that it's getting bigger, how quickly can it be moving? Relative to us, I mean." 

"It doesn't have to be moving 
quickly. Its momentum is as large 
as ours, so that, however gently 
it hits, we'll be nudged completely out of our orbit, maybe in toward Saturn, where we don't want 
to go. As a matter of fact, ice has 
a very low tensile strength, so 
that both planetoids might break 
up into gravel." 

Swenson rose to his feet. 
"Damn it, if I can tell how a shell 
is moving a thousand miles away, 
I can tell what a mountain is doing twenty miles away." He turned toward the ship. 

Long didn't stop him. 

Rioz said, "There's a nervous 
guy." 

The neighboring planetoid rose 
to zenith, passed overhead, began 
sinki ng. Twenty m i nutes 1 ater , 
the horizon opposite that portion 
behind which Saturn had disappeared burst into orange flame 
as its bulk began lifting again. 

Rioz called into his radio, "Hey, 
Dick, are you dead in there?" 

"I'm checking," came the muffled response. 

"Is it moving?" asked Long. 

"Yes." 

"Toward us?" 

There was a pause. Swehson's 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



41 



voice was a sick one. "On the 
nose, Ted. Intersection of orbits 
will take place in three days." 

"You're crazy!" yelled Rioz. 

"I checked four times," said 
Swenson. 

Long thought, blankly, "What 
do we do now?" 

IX 

SOME of the men were having 
trouble with the cables. They 
had to be laid precisely; their 
geometry had to be very nearly 
perfect for the magnetic field to 
attain maximum strength. In 
space, or even in air, it wouldn't 
have mattered. The cables would 
have lined up automatically once 
the juice went on. 
% Here it was different. A gouge 
had to be ploughed along the 
planetoid's surface and into it the 
cable had to be laid. If it were 
not lined up within a few minutes of arc of the calculated direction, a torque would be applied 
to the entire planetoid, with consequent loss of energy, none of 
which could be spared. The 
gouges then had to be redriven, 
the cables shifted aSd iced into 
the new positions. 

The men plodded wearily 
through the routine. 

And then the word reached 
them — 

"All hands to the jets!" 
Scavengers could not be said 



to be the type that took kindly 
to discipline, it was a grumbling, 
growling, muttering group that 
set about disassembling the jets 
of the ships that yet remained 
intact, carrying them to the tail 
end of the planetoid, grubbing 
them into position, and stringing 
the leads along the surface. 

It was almost twenty -four 
hours before one of them looked 
into the sky and said, "Holy jeepers!" followed by something less 
printable. 

His neighbor looked and said, 
"I'll be damned!" 

Once they noticed, all did. It 
became the most astonishing fact 
in the Universe. 

"Look at the Shadow!" 

It was spreading across the sky 
like an infected wound. Men 
looked at it, found it had doubled 
its size, wondered why they 
hadn't noticed that sooner. 

Work came to a virtual halt. 
They besieged Ted Long. 

He said, "We can't leave. We 
don't have the fuel to see us back 
to Mars and we don't have the 
equipment to capture another 
planetoid. So we've got to stay. 
Now the Shadow is creeping in 
on us because our blasting has 
thrown us out of orbit. We've got 
to change that by continuing the 
blasting. Since we can't blast the 
front end any more without endangering the ship we're building, let's try another way." 



42 




 



fXiHEY went back to work on 
-"- the jets with a furious energy 
that received impetus every half 
hour when the Shadow rose again 
over the horizon, bigger and more 
menacing than before. 

Long had no assurance that it 
would work. Even if the jets 
would respond to the distant 
controls, even if the supply of 
water, which depended upon a 
storage chamber opening directly into the icy body of the planetoid, with built-in heat projectors 
steaming the propulsive fluid directly into the driving cells, 
were adequate — there was still no 
certainty that the body of the 
planetoid without a magnetic 
cable sheathing would hold together under the enormously disruptive stresses. 

"Ready!" came the signal in 
Long's receiver. 

Long called, "Ready!" and depressed the contact. 

The vibration grew about him. 
The star field in the visiplate 
trembled. 

In the rear-view there was a 
distant gleaming spume of swiftly moving ice crystals. 

"It's blowing!" was the cry. 

It kept on blowing. Long dared 
not stop. For six hours, it blew, 
hissing, bubbling, steaming into 
space; the body of the planetoid 
converted to vapor and hurled 
away. 

The Shadow came closer until 



men did nothing but stare at the 
mountain in the sky, surpassing 
Saturn itself in spectacularity. 
Its every groove and valley was 
a plain scar upon its face. But 
when it passed through the planetoid's orbit, it crossed more than 
half a mile behind its then position. 

The steam-jet ceased. 

Long bent in his seat and cov- " 
ered his eyes. He hadn't eaten in 
two days. He could eat now, 
though. Not another planetoid 
was close enough to interrupt 
them, even if it began an approach that very moment. 

Back on the planetoid's surface, Swenson said, "All the time 
I watched that damned rock coming down, I kept saying to myself, 
'This can't happen. We can't let 
it happen.' " 

"Hell," said Rioz, "we were all 
nervous. Did you see Jim Davis? 
•He was green. I was a little 
jumpy myself." 

"That's not it. It wasn't just — 
dying, you know. I was thinking 
— I know it's funny, but I can't 
help it — I was thinking that Dora 
warned me I'd get killed, and now 
if I get myself killed, she'll never 
let me hear the last of it. Isn't 
that a crummy sort of attitude at 
a time like that?" 

"Listen," said Rioz, "you wanted to get married, so you got married. Why come to me with your 
troubles?" 



THE MARTIAN WAY

X 

THE flotilla, welded into a 
single unit, was returning over 
its mighty course from Saturn to 
Mars. Each day it .flashed over a 
length of space it had taken nine 
days outward. 

Ted Long had put the entire 
crew on emergency. With twentyfive ships embedded in the planetoid taken out of Saturn's rings, 
and unable to move or maneuver 
independently, the coordination 
of their power sources into unified 
blasts was a ticklish problem. The 
jarrings that took place on the 
first day of travel nearly shook 
them out from under their hair. 

That, at least, smoothed itself 
out as the velocity raced upward 
un^ er tne steady thrust from behind. They passed the onehundred - thousand - mile - an - hour 
mark late on the second day, and 
climbed steadily toward the million-mile mark and beyond. 

Long's ship, which formed the 
needle point of the frozen fleet, 
was the only one which possessed 
a five-way view of space. It was 
an uncomfortable position under 
the circumstances. Long found 
himself watching tensely, imagining somehow that the stars 
would slowly begin to slip backward, to whizz past them, under 
the influence of the multi-ship's 
tremendous rate of travel. 
They didn't, of course. They 



remained nailed to the black 
backdrop, their distance scorning 
with patient immobility any 
speed mere Man could achieve. 

The men complained bitterly 
after the first few days. It was 
not only that they were deprived 
of the space-float. They were 
burdened by much more than the 
ordinary pseudo-gravity field of 
the ships, by the effects of the 
fierce acceleration under which 
they were living. Long himself 
was weary to death of the relentless pressure against hydraulic 
cushions. 

They took to shutting off the 
jet thrusts one hour out of every 
four and Long fretted. 

It had been just over a year 
that he had last seen Mars 
shrinking in an observation window from this ship, which had 
then been an independent entity. 
What had happened since then? 
Was the colony still there? 

In something like a growing 
panic, Long sent out radio pulses 
toward Mars daily, with the 
combined power of twenty-five 
ships behind it. There was no 
answer. He expected none. Mars 
and Saturn were on opposite sides 
of the Sun now, and until he 
mounted high enough above the 
ecliptic to get the Sun well beyond the line connecting himself 
and Mars, solar interference 
would prevent any signal from 
getting through. 



44 




 



High above the outer rim of 
the Asteroid Belt, they reached 
maximum velocity. With short 
spurts of power from first one 
side jet, then another, the huge 
vessel reversed itself. The composite jet in the rear began its 
mighty roaring once again, but 
now the result was deceleration. 

They passed a hundred million 
miles over the Sun, curving down 
to intersect the orbit of Mars. 

A week out of Mars, answering 
signals were heard for the 
first time, fragmentary, ether-torn 
and incomprehensible, but they 
were coming from Mars. Earth 
and Venus were at angles sufficiently different to leave no 
doubt of that. 

Long relaxed. There were still 
humans on Mars, at any rate. 

Two days out of Mars, the signal was strong and clear and 
Sankov was at the other end. 

Sankov said, "Hello, son. It's 
three in the morning here. Seems 
like people have no consideration 
for an old man. Dragged me right 
out of bed." 

"I'm sorry, sir?" 

VDon't be. They were following orders. I'm afraid to ask, 
son. Anyone hurt? Maybe dead?" 

"No deaths, sir. Not one." 

"And — and the water? Any 
left?" 

Long said, with an effort at 
nonchalance, "Enough." 



"In that case, get home as fast 
as you can. Don't take any 
chances, of course." 

"There's trouble, then." 

"Fair- to-middling. When will 
you come down?" 

"Two days. Can you hold out 
that long?" 

"I'll hold out." 

Forty hours later, Mars had 
grown to a ruddy-orange ball that 
filled the ports and they were in 
the final planet -landing spiral. 

"Slowly," Long said to himself, "slowly." Under these conditions, even the thin atmosphere 
of Mars could do dreadful damage if they moved through it too 
quickly. 

Having come in from well 
above the ecliptic, their spiral 
passed from north to south. A 
polar cap shot whitely below 
them, then the much smaller one 
of the summer hemisphere, the 
large one again, the small one, at 
longer and longer intervals. The 
planet approached closer, the 
landscape began to show features. 

"Prepare for landing!" called 
Long. 

CANKOV did his best to look 
^ placid, which was difficult 
considering how closely the boys 
had shaved their return. But it 
had worked out well enough. 

Until a few days ago, he had no 
sure knowledge that they had 
survived. It seemed more- likely 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



— inevitable, almost — that they 
were nothing but frozen corpses 
somewhere in the trackless 
stretches from Mars to Saturn, 
new planetoids that had once 
been alive. 

The Committee had been 
dickering with him for weeks 
before the news had come. They 
had insisted on his signature to 
the paper for the sake of appearances. It would look like an 
agreement, voluntarily and mutually arrived at. But Sankov 
knew well that, given complete 
obstinacy on his part, they would 
act unilaterally and be damned 
with appearances. It seemed fairly certain that Hilder's election 
was secure now and they would 
take the chance of arousing a 
reaction of sympathy for Mars. 

So he dragged out the negotiations, dangling before them always the possibility of surrender. 

And then he heard from Long 
and concluded the deal quickly. 

The papers had lain before him 
and he had made a last statement for the benefit of the reporters who were present. 

He said, "Total imports of 
water from Earth are twenty million tons a year. This is declining 
as we develop our own piping 
system. If I sign this paper agreeing to an embargo, our industry 
will be paralyzed, any possibilities of expansion will halt. It 
looks to me as if that can't be 



what's in Earth's mind, can it?" 

Their eyes met his and held 
only a hard glitter. Assemblyman 
Digby.had already been replaced 
and they were unanimous against 
him. 

The Committee Chairman impatiently pointed out, "You have 
said alt this before." 

"I know, but right now I'm 
kind of getting ready to sign and 
I want it clear in my head. Is 
Earth set and determined to 
bring us to an end here?" 

"Of course not. Earth is interested in conserving its irreplaceable water supply, nothing 
else." 

"You have one and a half 
quintillion tons of water on 
Earth." 

The Committee Chairman said, 
"We cannot spare water." 

And Sankov had signed. 

That had been the final note 
he wanted. Earth had one and a 
half quintillion tons of water 
and could spare none of it. 

Now, a day and a half later, 
the Committee and the reporters 
waited in the spaceport dome. 
Through thick, curving windows, 
they could see the -bare and empty grounds of Mars Spaceport. 

The Committee Chairman asked, with annoyance, "How much 
longer do we have to wait? And, 
if you don't mind, what are we 
waiting for?" 

Sankov said, "Some of our 



46 




 



boys have been out in space, out 
past the asteroids." 

The Committee Chairman removed a pair of spectacles and 
cleaned them with a snowy white 
handkerchief. "And they're returning?" 

"They are." 

The Chairman shrugged, lifted 
his eyebrows in the direction of 
the reporters. 

TN the smaller room adjoining, a 
-■- knot of women and children 
clustered about another window. 
Sankov stepped back a bit to 
cast a glance toward them. He 
would much rather have been 
with them, been part of their excitement and tension. He, like 
them, had waited over a year 
now. He, like them, had thought, 
over and over again, that the men 
must be dead. 

"You see that?" said Sankov, 
pointing. 

"Hey!" cried a reporter. "It's 
a ship!" 

A confused shouting came from 
the adjoining room. 

It wasn't a ship so much as a 
bright dot obscured by a drifting white cloud. The cloud grew 
larger and began to have form. It 
was a double streak against the 
sky, the lower ends billowing out 
and upward again. As it dropped 
still closer, the bright dot at the 
upper end took on a crudely cylindrical form. 



It was rough and craggy, but 
where the sunlight hit, brilliant 
highlights bounced back. 

The cylinder dropped toward 
the ground with the ponderous 
slowness characteristic of space 
vessels. It hung suspended on 
those blasting jets and settled 
down upon the recoil of tons of 
matter hurling downward like a 
tired man dropping into his easy 
chair. 

And as it did so, a silence fell 
upon all within the dome. The 
women and children in one room, 
the politicians and reporters in 
the other remained frozen, heads 
craned incredulously upward. 

The cylinder's landing flanges, 
extending far below the two rear 
jets, touched ground and sank 
into the pebbly morass. And then 
the ship was motionless and the 
jet action ceased. 

But the silence continued in the 
Dome. It continued for a long 
time. 

Men came clambering down 
the sides of the immense vessel, 
inching down, down the two-mile 
trek to the ground, with spikes on 
their shoes and ice axes in their 
hands. They were gnats against 
the blinding surface. 

One of the reporters croaked, 
"What is it?" 

"That," said Sankov, calmly, 
"happens to be a chunk of matter 
that spent its time scooting 
around Saturn as part of its rings. 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



Our boys fitted it out with travelhead and jets and ferried it home. 
It justturns out the fragments in 
Saturn's rings are made up out of 
ice." 

TJE spoke into a continuing 
deathlike silence. "That thing 
that looks like a spaceship is just 
a mountain of hard water. If it 
were standing like that on Earth, 
it would be melting into a puddle 
and maybe it would break under 
its own weight. Mars is colder 
and has less gravity, so there's 
no such danger. 

"Of course, once we get this 
thing really organized, we can 
have water stations on the moons 
of Saturn and Jupiter and on the 
asteroids. We can scale in chunks 
of*Saturn's rings and pick them 
up and send them on at the various stations. Our Scavengers are 
good at that sort of thing. 

"We'll have all the water we 
need. That one chunk you see is 
just under a cubic mile — or about 



what Earth would send us in two 
hundred years, The boys used 
quite a bit of it coming back from 
Saturn. They made it in five 
weeks, they tell me, and used up 
about a hundred million tons. 
But, Lord, that didn't make any 
dent at all in that mountain. Are. 
you getting all this, boys?" 

He turned to the reporters. 
There was no doubt they were 
getting it. 

He said, "Then get this, too. 
Earth is worried about its water 
supply. It only has one and a 
half quintillion tons. It can't 
spare us a single ton out of it. 
Write down that we folks on 
Mars are worried about Earth 
and don't want anything to happen to Earth people. Write down 
that we'll sell water to Earth. 
Write down that we'll let them 
have million-ton lots for a reasonable fee. Write down that in 
ten years, we figure we can sell 
it in cubic-mile lots. Write down 
that Earth can quit worrying be




THE MARTIAN WAY 



cause Mars can sell it all the 
water it needs and wants." 

The Committee Chairman was 
past hearing. He was feeling the 
future rushing in. Dimly, he 
could see the reporters grinning 
as they wrote furiously. 

Grinning! 

He could hear the grin become 
laughter on Earth as Mars turned the tables so neatly on the 
anti-Wasters. He could hear the 
laughter thunder from every continent when word of the fiasco 
spread. And he could see the 
abyss, deep and black as space, 
into which would drop forever 
the political hopes of John Hilder 
and of every opponent of space 
flight left on Earth — his own included, of course. 

IN the adjoining room, Dora 
Swenson screamed with joy, 
and Peter, grown two inches, 
jumped up and down, calling, 
'Daddy! Daddy!" 

Richard Swenson had just 
stepped off the extremity of the 
flange and. face showing clearly 
through the clear silicone of the 
headpiece, marched toward the 
Dome. 

"Did you ever see a guy look 
so happy?" asked Ted Long. 
"Maybe there's something in this 
marriage business." 

"Ah, you've just been out in 
space too long," Rioz said.

Destroying the spirit of the

the aliens had the best way! 



THEY never did discover 
whose fault it was. Fannia 
pointed out that if Donnaught had had the brains of an 
ox, as well as the build, he would 
have remembered to check the 
tanks. Donnaught, although twice 
as big as him, wasn't quite as fast 
with an insult. He intimated, 
after a little thought/ that Fannia's nose might have obstructed 
his reading of the fuel guage. 

This still left them twenty 
light-years from Thetis, with a 
cupful of transformer fuel in the

emergency tank. 

"All right," Fannia said presently. "What's done is done. We 
can squeeze about three lightyears out of the fuel before we're 
back on atomics. Hand me The 
Galactic Pilot — unless you forgot 
that, too." 

Donnaught dragged the bulky 
microfilm volume out of its locker, and they explored its pages. 

The Galactic Pilot told them 
they were in a sparse, seldomvisited section of space, which 
they already knew. The nearest 
planetary system was Hatterfield ; 
no intelligent life there. Sersus 
had a native population, but no 
refueling facilities. The same with 
Illed, Hung and Porderai. 

"Ah-ha!" Fannia said. "Read 
that, Donnaught. If you can read, 
that is." 

"Cascella," Donnaught read, 
slowly and clearly, following the 
line with a thick forefinger. "Type 
M.sun. Three planets, intelligent 
(AA3C) human-type life on second. Oxygen -breathers. Non-mechanical. Religious. Friendly. 
Unique social structure, described 
in Galactic Survey Report

stable at three billion. Basic Cascellan vocabulary taped under 
Cas33b2. Scheduled for resurvey 
2375A.D. Cache of transformer 
fuel left, beam coordinate 8741 
kgl. Physical descript: Unocc.

"Transformer fuel, boy!" Fannia said gleefully. "I believe we 
will get to Thetis, after all." He 
punched the new direction on the 
ship's tape. "If that fuel's still 
there." 

"Should we read up on the 
unique social structure?" Donnaught asked, still poring over 
The Galactic Pilot. 

"Certainly," Fannia said. "Just 
step over to the main galactic 
base on Earth and buy me a 
copy." 

"I forgot," Donnaught admitted slowly. 

"Let me see," Fannia said, 
dragging out the ship's language 
library. "Cascellan, Cascellan . . . 
Here it is. Be good while I learn 
the language." He set the tape 
in the hypnophone and switched 
it on. "Another useless tongue in 
my overstuffed head," he murmured, and then the hypnophone 
took over. 

/^OM I NG out of transformer 
^* drive with at least a drop of 
fuel left, they switched to atomics. Fannia rode the beam right 
across the planet, locating the 
slender metal spire of the Galactic 
Survey cache. The plain was so 
longer unoccupied, however, The 
Cascellans had built a city around 
the cache, and the spire dominated the crude wood-and-mud 
buildings. 

"Hang on," Fannia said, and 



WARRIOR RACE 



51 



brought the ship down on the 
outskirts of the city, in a field of 
stubble. 

"Now look," Fannia said, unfastening his safety belt. "We're 
just here for fuel. No souvenirs, 
no side-trips, no fraternizing." 

Through the port, they could 
see a cloud of dust from the city. 
As it came closer, they made out 
figures running toward their ship. 

"What do you think this unique 
social structure is?" Donnaught 
asked, pensively checking the 
charge in a needier gun. 

"I know not and care less," 
Fannia said, struggling into space 
armor. "Get dressed." 

"The air's breathable." 

"Look, pachyderm, for all we 
know, these Cascellans think the 
proper way to greet visitors is to 
chop off their heads and stuff 
them with green apples. If Galactic says unique, it probably 
means unique." 

"Galactic said they were friendly." 

"That means they haven't got 
atomic bombs. Come on, get 
dressed." Donnaught put down 
the needier and struggled into an 
oversize suit of space armor. Both 
men strapped on needlers, paralyzers, and a few grenades. 

"I don't think we have anything to worry about," Fannia 
said, tightening the last nut on his 
helmet. "Even if they get rough, 
they can't crack space armor. 



And if they're not rough, we 
won't have any trouble. Maybe 
these gewgaws will help." He 
picked up a box of trading articles 
— mirrors, toys and the like. 

Helmeted and armored, Fannia 
slid out the port and raised one 
hand to the Cascellans. The language, hypnotically placed in his 
mind, leaped to his lips. 

"We come as friends and brothers. Take us to the chief." 

The natives clustered around, 
gaping at the ship and the space 
armor. Although they had the 
same number of eyes, ears and 
limbs as humans, they completely 
missed looking like them. 

"If they're friendly," Donnaught asked, climbing out of 
the port, "why all the hardware?" 
The Cascellans were dressed predominantly in a collection of 
knives, swords and daggers. Each 
man had at least five, and some 
had eight or nine. 

"Maybe Galactic got their signals crossed," Fannia said, as the 
natives spread out in an escort. 
"Or maybe the natives just use 
the knives for mumblypeg." 

r |^HE city was typical of a nonmechanical culture. Narrow, 
packed-dirt streets twisted between ramshackle huts. A few 
two-story buildings threatened to 
collapse at any minute. A stench 
filled the air, so strong that Fannia's filter couldn't quite eradi

cate it. The Cascellans bounded 
ahead of the heavily laden Earthmen, dashing around like a pack 
of playful puppies. Their knives 
glittered and clanked. 

The chief's house was the only 
three-story building in the city. 
The tall spire of the cache was 
right behind it. 

"If you come in peace," 4 the 
chief said when they entered, 
"you are welcome." He was a 
middle-aged Cascellan with at 
least fifteen knives strapped to 
various parts of his person. He 
squatted cross-legged on a raised 
dais. 

"We are privileged," Fannia 
said. He remembered from the 
hypnotic language lesson that 
"chief" on Cascella meant more 
than it usually did on Earth. The 
chief here was a combination of 
king, high priest, deity and bravest warrior. 

"We have a few simple gifts 
here," Fannia added, placing the 
gewgaws at the king's feet. "Will 
his majesty accept?" 

"No," the king said. "We accept no gifts." Was that the 
unique social structure? Fannia 
wondered. It certainly was not 
human. "We are a warrior race. 
What we want, we take." 

Fannia sat cross-legged in 
front of the dais and exchanged 
conversation with the king while 
Donnaught played with the 
spurned toys. Trying to overcome 



the initial bad impression, Fannia 
told the chief about the stars 
and other worlds, since simple 
people usually liked fables. He 
spoke of the ship, not mentioning 
yet that it was out of fuel. He 
spoke of Cascella, telling the 
chief how its fame was known 
throughout the Galaxy. 

"That is as it should be," the 
chief said proudly. "We art a 
race of warriors, the like of which 
has never "been seen. Every man 
of us dies fighting." 

"You must have fought some 
great wars," Fannia said politely, 
wondering what idiot had written 
up the galactic report. 

"I have not fought a war for 
many years," the chief said. "We 
are united now, and all our enemies have joined us." 

Bit by bit, Fannia led up to 
the matter of the fuel. 

"What is this 'fuel?' " the chief 
asked, haltingly because there 
was no equivalent for it in the 
Cascellan language. 

"It makes our ship go." 

"And where is it?" 

"In the metal spire," Fannia 
said. "If you would just allow 
us—" 

"In the holy shrine?" the chief 
exclaimed, shocked. "The tall 
metal church which the gods left 
here long ago?" 

"Yeah," Fannia said sadly, 
knowing what was coming. "I 
guess that's it." 



WARRIOR RACE 



53 



"It is sacrilege for an outworlder to go near it," the chief said. 
"I forbid it." 

"We need the fuel." Fanna 
was getting tired of sitting crosslegged. Space armor wasn't built 
for complicated postures. "The 
spire was put here for such 
emergencies." 

"Strangers, know that I am god 
of my people, as well as their 
leader. If you dare approach 
the sacred temple, there will be 
war." 

"I was afraid of that," Fannia 
said, getting to his feet. 

"And since we are a race of 
warriors,*' the chief said, "at my 
command, every fighting man of 
the planet will move against you. 
More will come from the hills 
and from across the rivers." 

Abruptly, the chief drew a 
knife. It must have been a signal, 
because every native in the room 
did the same. 

FANNIA dragged Donnaught 
away from the toys. "Look, 
lummox. These friendly warriors 
can't do a damn thing to us. 
Those knives can't cut space 
armor, and I doubt if they have 
anything better. Don't let them 
pile up on you, though. Use the 
paralyzer first, the needier if they 
really get thick." 

"Right." Donnaught whisked 
out and primed a paralyzer in a 
single coordinated movement. 



With weapons, Donnaught was 
fast and reliable, which was virtue 
enough for Fannia to keep him 
as a partner. 

."We'll cut around this building 
and grab the fuel. Two cans 
ought to be enough. Then we'll 
beat it fast." . 

They walked out the building, 
followed by the Cascellans. Four 
carriers lifted the chief, who was 
barking orders. The narrow 
street outside was suddenly 
jammed with armed natives. No 
one tried to touch them yet, but 
at least a thousand knives were 
flashing in the sun. 

In front of the cache was a 
solid phalanx of Cascellans. They 
stood behind a network of ropes 
that probably marked the boundary between sacred and profane 
ground. * 

"Get set for it," Fannia said, 
and stepped over the ropes, 

Immediately the foremost temple guard raised his knife. Fannia 
brought up the paralyzer, not 
firing it yet, still moving forward. 

The foremost native shouted 
something, and the knife swept 
across in a glittering arc. The 
Cascellan gurgled something else, 
staggered and fell. Bright blood 
oozed from his throat. 

"I told you not to use the 
needier yet!" Fannia said. 

"I didn't," Donnaught protested. Glancing back, Fannia saw 
that Donnaught's needier was 



54 




 



still holstered. 

"Then I don't get it," said 
Fannia bewilderedly. 

Three more natives bounded 
forward, their knives held high. 
They tumbled to the ground also. 
Fannia stopped and watched as a 
platoon of natives advanced on 
them. 

Once they were within stabbing 
range of the Earthmen, the natives were slitting their own 
throats! 

Fannia was frozen for a moment, unable to believe his eyes. 
Donnaught halted behind him. 

Natives were rushing forward 
by the hundreds now, their knives 
poised, screaming at the Earthmen. As they came within range, 
each native stabbed himself, tumbling on a quickly growing pile 
of bodies. In minutes the Earthmen were surrounded by a heap 
of bleeding Cascellan flesh, which 
was steadily growing higher. 

"All right!" Fannia shouted. 
"Stop it." He yanked Donnaught 
back with him, to profane ground. 
"Truce!" he yelled in Cascellan. 

The crowd parted and the chief 
was carried through. With two 
knives clenched in his fists, he 
was* panting from excitement. 

"We have won the first battle*!" 
he said proudly. "The might of 
our warriors frightens even such 
aliens as yourselves. You shall 
not profane our temple while a 
man is alive on Cascella!" 



The natives shouted their approval and triumph. 

The two aliens dazedly stumbled back to their ship. 

??CO that's what Galactic 

*^ meant by 'a unique social 
structure,' " Fannie said morosely. He stripped off his armor and 
lay down on his bunk. ' 'Their 
way of making war is to suicide 
their enemies into capitulation." 

"They must be nuts," Donnaught grumbled. "That's no way 
to fight." 

"It works, doesn't it?" Fannia 
got up and stared out a porthole. The sun was setting, painting the city a charming red in 
its glow. The beams of light 
glistened off the spire, of the 
Galactic cache. Through the open 
doorway , they could hear the 
boom and rattle of drums. "Tribal call to arms," Fannia said. 

"I still say it's crazy." Donnaught had some definite ideas 
on fighting. "It ain't human." 

"I'll buy that. The idea seems 
to be that if enough people 
slaughter themselves, the enemy 
gives up out of sheer guilty 
conscience." 

"What if the enemy doesn't 
give up?" 

"Before these people united, 
they must have fought it out 
tribe to tribe, suiciding until 
someone gave up. The losers 
probably joined the victors; the 



WARRIOR RACE 



55 



tribe must have grown until it 
could take over the planet by 
sheer weight of numbers." Fannia looked carefully at Donnaught, trying to see if he understood. "It's anti-survival, of 
course; if someone didn't give up, 
the race would probably kill 
themselves." He shook his head. 
"But war of any kind is antisurvival. Perhaps they've got 
rules." 

"Couldn't we just barge in and 
grab the fuel quick?" Donnaught 
asked. "And get out before they 
all killed themselves?" 

"I don't think so," Fannia said. 
"They might go on committing 
suicide for the next ten years, 
figuring they were still fighting 
us." He looked thoughtfully at 
the^city. "It's that chief of theirs. 
He's their god and he'd probably 
keep them suiciding until he was 
the only man left. Then he'd grin, 
say, 'We are great warriors,' and 
kill himself." 

Donnaught shrugged his big 
shoulders in disgust. "Why don't 
we knock him off?" 

"They'd just elect another 
god." The sun was almost below 
the horizon now. "I've got an 
idea, though," Fannia said. He 
scratched his head. "It might 
work. All we can do is try." 

AT midnight, the two men 
sneaked out of the ship, mov-. 
ing silently into the city. They 



were both dressed in space armor 
again. Donnaught carried two 
empty fuel cans. Fannia had 
his paralyzer out. 

The streets were dark and silent 
as they slid along walls and 
around posts, keeping out of 
sight. A native turned a corner 
suddenly, but Fannia paralyzed 
him before he could make a 
sound. 

They crouched in the darkness, 
in the mouth of an alley facing 
the cache. ' 

"Have you got it straight?" 
Fannia asked. "I paralyze the 
guards. You bolt in and fill up 
those cans. We get the hell out 
of here, quick. When they check, 
they find the cans still there. 
Maybe they won't commit suicide then." 

The men moved across the 
shadowy steps in front of the 
cache. There were three Cascellans guarding the entrance, their 
knives stuck in their loincloths. 
Fannia stunned them with a medium charge, and Donnaught 
broke into a run. 

Torches instantly flared, natives boiled out of every alleyway, shouting, waving their 
knives. 

"We've been ambushed!" Fannia shouted. "Get^ back here, 
Donnaught!" 

Donnaught hurriedly retreated. 
The natives had been waiting for 
them. Screaming, yowling, they 



56 




 



rushed at the Earthmen, slitting 
their own throats at five-foot 
range. Bodies tumbled in front 
of Fannia, almost tripping him 
as he backed up. Donnaught 
caught him by an arm and yanked him straight. They ran out of 
the sacred area. 

"Truce, damn it!" Fannia called out. "Let me speak to the chief. 
Stop it! Stop it!* I want a truce!" 

Reluctantly, the Cascellans 
stopped their slaughter. 

"This is war," the chief said, 
striding forward. His almost human face was stern under the 
torchlight. "You have seen our 
warriors. Yqu know now that you 
cannot stand against them. The 
word has spread to all our lands. 
My entire people are prepared to 
do battle." ■ 

He looked proudly at his fellow-Cascellans, then back to the 
Earthmen. "I myself will lead 
my people into battle now. There 
will be no stopping us. We will 
fight until you surrender yourselves completely, stripping off 
your armor." 

"Wait, chief." Fannia panted, 
sick at the sight of so much 
blood. The clearing was a scene 
out of the Inferno. Hundreds of 
bodies were sprawled around. The 
streets were muddy with blood. 

"Let me confer with my partner 
tonight. I will speak with you 
tomorrow." 

"No." the chief said. "You 



started the battle. It must go to 
its conclusion. Brave men wish 
to die in battle. It is our fondest 
wish. You are the first enemy we 
have had in many years, since 
we subdued the mountain tribes." 

"Sure," Fannia said. "But let's" 
talk about it — " 

"I myself will fight you," the 
chief said, holding up a dagger. "I 
will die for my people, as a warrior must!" 

"Hold it I" Fannia shouted. 
"Grant us a truce. We are allowed to fight only by sunlight. It 
is a tribal taboo." 

The chief thought for a moment, then said, "Very well. Until tomorrow." 

The beaten Earthmen walked 
slowly back to their ship amid 
the jeers of the victorious populace, 

NEXT morning, Fannia still 
didn't have a plan. He knew 
that he had to have fuel; he 
wasn't planning on spending the 
rest of his life on Cascella, or 
waiting until the Galactic Survey 
sent another ship, in fifty years 
or so. On the other hand, he 
hesitated at the idea of being 
responsible for the death of anywhere up to three billion people. 
It wouldn't be a very good record 
to take to Thetis. The Galactic 
Survey might find out about it. 
Anyway, he just wouldn't do it. 
He was stuck both ways. 



WARRIOR RACE 



57 



Slowly, the two men walked 
out to meet the chief. Fannia was 
still searching wildly for an idea 
while listening to the drums 
booming. 

•"If there was only someone we 
"could fight," Donnaught mourned, looking at his useless blasters. 

"That's the deal," Fannia said. 
"Guilty conscience is making sinners of us all, or something like 
that. They expect us to give in 
before the carnage gets out of 
hand." He considered for a moment. "It's not so crazy, actually. 
On Earth, armies don't usually 
fight until every last man is 
slaughtered on one side. Someone 
surrenders when they've had 
enough." 

"If they'd just fight us!" 

*Yeah, if they only — 11 He 
stopped. "We'll fight each other!" 
he said. "These people look at 
suicide as war. Wouldn't they 
look upon war — real fighting — as 
suicide?" 

"What good would that do us?" 
Donnaught asked. 

They were coming into the city 
now and the streets were lined 
with armed natives. Around the 
city there were thousands more. 
Natives were filling the plain, as 
far as the eye could see. Evidently 
they had responded to the drums 
and were here to do battle with 
the aliens. 

Which meant, of courpe, a 
wholesale suicide. 



"Look at it this way," Fannia 
said. "If a guy plans on suiciding 
on Earth, what do we do?" 

"Arrest him?" Donnaught asked. 

"Not at first. We offer him anything he wants, if he just won't 
do it. People offer the guy money, 
a job, their daughters, anything, 
just so he won't do it. It's taboo 
on Earth." 

"So?" 

"So," Fannia went on, "maybe 
fighting is just as taboo here. 
Maybe they'll offer us fuel, if 
we'll just stop." 

Donnaught looked dubious, but 
Fannia felt it was worth a try. 

TpHE Y pushed their way through 
* the crowded city, to the entrance of the cache. The chief was 
waiting for 'them, beaming on 
his people like a jovial war god. 

"Are you ready to do battle?" 
he asked. "Or to surrender?" 

"Sure," Fannia said. "Now, 
Donnaught!" 

He swung, and his mailed fist 
caught Donnaught in the ribs. 
Donnaught blinked. 

"Come on, you idiot, hit me 
back." 

Donnaught swung, and Fannia 
staggered from the force of the 
blow. In a second they were at 
it like a pair of blacksmiths, 
mailed blows ringing from their 
armored hides. 

"A little lighter," Fannia gasp


58 




 



ed, picking himself up from the 
ground. "You're denting my ribs." 
He belted Donnaught viciously 
on the helmet. 

"Stop it!" the chief cried. "This 
is disgusting!" 

"It's working," Fannia panted. 
"Now let me strangle you. I think 
that might do it." 

Donnaught obliged by falling 
to the ground. Fannia clamped 
both hands around Donnaught's 
armored neck, and squeezed. 

"Make believe you're in agony, 
idiot," he said. 

Donnaught groaned and moaned as convincingly as he could. 

"You must stop \" the chief 
screamed. "It is terrible to kill 
another!" 

"Then let me get some fuel," 
Fannia said, tightening his grip 
on Donnaught's throat. 

The chief thought it over for 
a little while. Then he shook his 
head. 

"No." 

"What?" 

"You are aliens. If you want to 
do this disgraceful thing, do it. 
But you shall not profane our 
religious relics." 

p\ONNAUGHT and Fannia 
staggered to their feet. Fannia was exhausted from fighting 
in the heavy space armor; he 
barely made it up. 

"Now," the chief said, "surrender at once. Take off your 



armor or do battle with us." 

The thousands of warriors — 
possibly millions, because more 
were arriving every second — 
shouted their blood-wrath. The 
cry was taken up on the outskirts and echoed to the hills, 
where more fighting men were 
pouring down into the crowded 
plain. 

Fannia's face contorted. He 
couldn't give himself and Donnaught up to the Cascellans. They 
might be cooked at the next 
church supper. For a moment he 
considered going after the fuel 
and letting the damned fools 
suicide all they pleased. 

His mind an angry blank, Fannia staggered forward and hit the 
chief in the face with a mailed 
glove. 

The chief went down, and the 
natives backed away in horror. 
Quickly, the chief snapped out a 
knife and brought it up to his 
throat. Fannia's hands closed on 
the chief's wrists. 

"Listen to me," Fannia croaked. "We're going to take that fuel. 
If any man makes a move — if 
anyone kills himself — I'll kill 
your chief." 

The natives milled around uncertainly. The chief was struggling wildly in Fannia's hands, 
trying to get a knife to his throat, 
so he could die honorably. 

"Get it," Fannia told Donnaught, "and hurry it up." 



WARRIOR RACE 



59 



The natives were uncertain just 
what to do. They had their knives 
poised at their throats, ready to 
plunge if battle was joined. 

"Don't do it," Fannia warned. 
"I'll kill the chief and then he'll 
never die a warrior's death." 

The chief was still trying to 
kill himself. Desperately, Fannia 
held on, knowing he had to keep 
him from suicide in order to hold 
the threat of death over him. 

"Listen, Chief," Fannia said, 
eying the uncertain crowd. "I 
must have your promise there'll 
be no more war between us. Either I get it or I kill you." 

"Warriors!" the chief roared. 
"Choose a new ruler. Forget me 
and do battle!" 

The Cascellans" were still uncertain, but knives started to lift. 

"If you do it," Fannia shouted 
in despair, "I'll kill your chief. 
Ill kill all ol your 

That stopped them. 

"I have powerful magic in my 
ship. I can kill every last man, 
and then you won't be able to 
die a warrior's death. Or get to 
heaven!" 

The chief tried to free himself 
with a mighty surge that almost 
tore one of his arms free, but 
Fannia held on, pinning both 
arms behind his back. 

"Very well," the chief said, 
tears springing into his eyes. "A 
warrior must die by his own hand. 
You have won, alien.'* 



The crowd shouted curses as 
the Earthmen carried the chief 
and the cans of fuel back to the 
ship. They waved their knives 
and danced up and down in a 
frenzy of hate. 

"Let's make it fast," Fannia 
said, after Donnaught had fueled 
the ship. 

He gave the chief a push and 
leaped in. In a second they were 
in the air, heading for Thetis and 
the nearest bar at top speed. 

The natives were hot for blood 
— their own. Every man of them 
pledged his life to wiping out the 
insult to their leader and god, 
and to their shrine. 

But the aliens were gone. There 
was nobody to fight.

Sugar Plum 

By R. BRETNOR 

If not for two items, this would be a funny 
story— the Atomic Age brought back the 1925 
vogue, and inhibition is not shatter-proof. 



ON A clear spring evening 
in 2189, Charles Edward 
Button came home half 
an hour late for his supper, tossed 
his hat to the robot butler who 
came out from behind the DoltAll, and announced that he had 
' just bought a planet. 

His wife, Betty, was looking 
small and long-suff ering on a 
plastic reproduction of a Victo


rian love-seat, and her* cousin 
Aurelia, a large, handsome woman, was standing behind her 
protectively. 

"Of course," he informed them, 
"it's not a big planet. But what 
a bargain! With real oceans, and 
two moons, and — " 

"Real estate, real estate, real 
estate !" Cousin Aurelia's tart 
voice cut him off in mid-sentence. 



62 




 




SUGAR PLUM 



"You know what's come of every 
one of your investments. Call the 
man right now and tell him you 
want your money back!" 

"I'm afraid it's too late." 
Charles avoided her eye. "I 
bought it up at a tax-auction and 
— well, the government never refunds." 

"I thought so. A planet nobody 
wants. Probably all run down, 
with swamps and deserts, and in 
some dreadful, shabby district 
where the neighbors have 
squirmy tentacles, or eyes on 
stalks, or big, nasty beaks!" 

"It isn't at all. It's in a good 
neighborhood — only two systems 
away from the Inchcapes' new 
summer planet. A little remote, 
but that means more privacy." 
*He took a catalogue out of his 
pocket. " 'Parcel 71,' " he read. 
" 'Sugar Plum, a Class IV planet' 
— that means it's like Earth, only 
bigger — 'claimed 8/12/85 by 
Space Captain Alexander Burgee, 
under Planetary Homestead Act 
of 2147 (amended.)' And here's 
his description of the place where 
he landed: 'Neat as a pin, fine 
climate, full of critters and fish, 
quite uninhabited.' He was lost 
in Deep Space, poor fellow. That's 
why they sold it." 

jDETTY smiled faintly. "The 
" Inchcapes call their planet 
Bide-A-Wee. I think Sugar 
Plum's ever so much nicer. But — 



but can we afford it?" 

"We certainly can't!" fumed 
Cousin Aurelia. "We'll put it 
back on the market and salvage 
whatever we can." 

"No, we won't," Charles said 
firmly. "And it's not just a summer resort. We're pulling up 
stakes to live there all year 
round." 

Betty gasped. 

Cousin Aurelia straightened up, 
bristling. 

"I have made up my mind," 
Charles went on. "I have done a 
lot of serious thinking." He pointed at the heavily framed neodaguerreotype portraits on the 
walls. "Our ancestors rediscovered the only true principles, those 
of the great Nineteenth Century. 
They brought the Second Victorian Age into being. Civilization 
reached its peak, its full flowering. But now all is crumbling before the poisonous onslaught of 
modernism. We who have not 
been corrupted must seek out a 
refuge. That, Cousin, is why I 
bought Sugar Plum." 

"Nonsense!" exclaimed Cousin 
Aurelia. "There may be changes 
everywhere else, but never in 
Boston." 

"Ha!" Charles looked at his 
watch. "Solomon!" he called out. 

The butler came bowing out 
of the DoItAll nook, where the 
servants stayed when they were 
switched off. He wore a swallow


64 




 



tail coat and knee-breeches, and 
had kinky white hair. Made to 
order, he was Cousin Aurelia's 
idea. 

"Yassuh, Marse Charles. Here 
Ah is." 

"Solomon," ordered Charles, 
"tune in Watson Widgett." 

Betty paled, uttering a polite 
little scream. 

"Are you mad?" cried Cousin 
Aurelia. "I've heard about him. 
I'll not have that man in my 
home!" 

CHARLES squared his shoulders. "Cousin, may I remind 
you that / am head of this house, 
and that we are Victorians? It's 
high time you found out what's 
going on. Solomon!" 
"Yassuh." 

There was a click from the 
DoItAU, a brief flash of light and 
a figure appeared in their midst, 
a cheerful young man in loose 
trousers and shirt, without coat, 
waistcoat, cravat, or even a pair 
of suspenders. He was grinning 
at Cousin Aurelia. 

"Boys and girls," he was saying, "Wyoming has outlawed corsets! The folks in Siskiyou, 
California, have given women the 
vote! And listen to this. The Bikini swimsuit — just a wisp and a 
twist — is back on the market!" 
He winked loathsomely. "Yes, 
indeed, our prize fake Victorians, 
our second-hand stuffed shirts, 



are due for a fall. Here's the best 
news today, from a cute little 
lady right here in old Boston." 
He unfolded a paper. "Dear Watsy, When I first found your prog r a m, I was a real Mrs. 
Biedermeyer. Marriage was something we gentlewomen tried to 
endure while we knitted an antimacassar. It wasn't supposed to 
be fun. Then a friend tipped me 
off to your — " 

At this point. Cousin Aurelia 
emitted a shriek, rolled her eyes 
and crumpled to the carpet. 

Charles gestured and the commentator vanished with a click 
and a flash. Betty scurried out 
and returned with the smelling 
salts. 

Presently, Cousin Aurelia regained her senses, shivered, and 
said, "It's too awful for words. If 
it were not for Betty, I would 
surely have left long ago. As it 
is, I shall go where you go, to 
protect her, of course." 

Then she permitted Betty to 
help her to her feet and out of 
the room. 

"Solomon !" Charles called 
loudly. 

"Yassuh, Marse Charles." 

"Set the table for two," Charles 
commanded. "I shall dial the 
dinner myself." 

He felt very adventurous and 
masterful. Dialing dinner without 
aid was fine training in self-reliance. 



SUGAR PLUM 



65 



SIX weeks later, the three of 
them stood on the bridge of 
the space freighter Beautiful Joe, 
watching Sugar Plum as the vessel entered an orbit around it. 

But Charles Edward Button 
didn't feel at all masterful, or 
even adventurous. 

They stood next to Possett. the 
skipper, a great, hairy man with 
gold teeth, a bad squint, and an 
air of gloomy cunning about him. 
After her first look at Possett, 
Cousin Aurelia had locked herself in her cabin, allowing no one 
but Betty to approach her, and 
threatening to subsist on the halfdozen cases of Dr. Stringfellow's 
Vegetable Remedy she kept 
under her berth. Charles, however, had been sure that Possett's 
h*art was both kindly and chivalrous. 

"Take those tall stories of his," 
he said more than once. "Betty, 
they don't mean a • thing. Old 
spacedogs love to kid tenderfeet. 
Imagine trying to make me believe that it's dangerous out here! 
And all that malarkey about 
Captain Burgee being a pirate or 
something!" 

They stared at Sugar Plum, at 
its small polar ice caps, its seas, 
its continents greener than 
Earth's, its wandering white 
clouds. Not many hours—before, 
it had been only a dust mote, a 
pinpoint of light in the void. Now 
it filled half the sky. And sud


denly Charles understood the immensities, the unspeakable 
stretches of space in which Boston had vanished. 

Shivering, he wished he were 
home, stiffly safe in a curlicued 
chair, with Solomon dialing his 
dinner for him. 

"Nice piece of property," 
grunted Possett around his cigar. 
"Too bad about — " He broke off 
with a shrug. 

"About what?" asked Charles, 
alarmed. 

"I wouldn't want to be in your 
shoes if Burgee comes around 
and finds you'd run off with his 
planet." 

"Burgee?, He was lost out in 
space!" 

"His kind don't stay lost. 
Chances are he's hiding out from 
the law. But it's none of my business. Just thought I'd warn 
you." 

Charles laughed weakly. "You 
c-can't frighten me. I'm sure 
there aren't any pirates in space 
any more." 

Possett turned to his weasel faced mate. "Loopy, call the New 
Texas spaceport. Get Mac on the 
screen." 

The mate nodded. He twiddled 
a dial and punched at a switch. 
The screen glowed. After some 
seconds, the face of a red-haired 
person appeared, looking rather 
disgusted. 

"New Texas, New Texas," 



66 




 



came a voice. "I hear you, Beautiful Joe. What the hell do you 
want?" 

"Dude aboard wants some info," said Possett. "Wants to know 
what Burgee did for a living — 
Alexander Burgee. Also, are the 
coppers still trying to find him?" 

The face frowned. "Possett, 
you know damn well Burgee was 
a pirate. You know he's been 
listed as lost. Now quit wasting 
my time. New Texas out." 

THE face vanished. The mate 
snickered nastily. And Charles 
just stood there gaping. 

"A real pirate!" squeaked 
Cousin Aurelia. "Wh-what would 
he do? Would he kill us?" 

"Might do anything. But — " 
eying her, Possett leered — "he's 
like me. Likes 'em well fattened 
up. Lady, you needn't worry." 

Cousin Aurelia paled. She 
started to sway. Then, perhaps 
recalling the uncarpeted deck, 
she recovered and looked haughty instead. 

"I am going right back to my 
cabin," she proclaimed, and 
stalked off the bridge. 

"Cousin Aurelia is very genteel," Betty snapped at the captain. "You had no right to insult 
her. Besides, she's only twenty 
pounds overweight." 

"Don't mind me. I go for her 
type." Possett shook his head 
darkly and turned toward 



Charles. "Button, man to man, a 
batfk- country planet's no place 
for the ladies. Look, I'll take the 
thing off your hands. I can handle 
Burgee. Twelve thousand cold 
cash for your stuff and the deed, 
and I'll throw in a lift to New 
Texas. There's a liner from 
there." 

Charles thought of the comfortable Earth and was tempted. 
"But I paid thirty-five," he protested uncertainly. "I mean, 
twelve is — " 

"Take it or leave it. I'm trying 
to do you a favor." 

"No, I guess we'll leave it," 
answered Betty. 

Charles looked around in surprise. Her lips were compressed, 
her blue eyes narrowed with 
astonishing determination. 

"We've come all this way," she 
declared, "so we might as well 
keep it. I think it has — well, possibilities. We've had the whole 
house done over and the servants 
remodeled. And we'll have all 
the DoItAll services — teleprojection, medical care, and everything 
else — from the New Texas substation. I'm sure we'll get along 
nicely." 

The skipper of the Beautiful 
Joe wasn't pleased. "It's your 
necks. Don't be blaming me for 
what happens," he growled. 
"Well, where do you want to set 
down?" 

"Set down?" gulped Charles. 



SUGAR PLUM 



67 



"R-right now?" 

"Land and unload, it says in 
the contract. I ain't got all day. 
I'll dump you at Burgee's old 
landing, load up with fresh water, 
and blast off for New Texas." 

Charles had no other spot in 
mind. 

"Okay," Possett said to the two 
robot crewmen at the main controls, "take her down." 

k T the waterfall's edge, flowering trees twisted their roots 
in the cliffside, and a fresh wind 
scattered plumes of its spray 
through their leaves. Taller 
trees, bell -blossomed, fanned out 
from the pool, gave way to a 
meadow, and followed the course 
of the stream down a broadening 
valley — among faceted boulders 
of translucent quartz, rose-pink, 
green, and golden, sheltering 
small, lustrous spires of fragile 
fungi. 

On the meadow stood the 
house, the latest in Second Victorian, complete with carved 
plastic false-front in early Schenectady Gothic. The Buttons 
themselves, with Cousin Aurelia, 
stood in front of it. They wore 
long linen dusters and sun helmets with heavy mosquito veils. 
They were going exploring. 

Cousin Aurelia was sputtering: 
"Do you know what he said when 
he left? 'Kid, you come along 
with Mike Possett. You don't 



want no part of that planet. I'll 
show you a ripsnorting time!' 
Then he gave me a look that — 
that was positively lecherous." 
She shuddered. "At least we'll 
have no more of that nonsense. 
Your planet is uninhabited." 

Betty looked worried. "I've the 
funniest feeling," she said. "As 
if someone was watching." 

"That's absurd!" snapped 
Cousin Aurelia. "You must be 
imagin — " She stopped in her 
tracks. "Wh-what's that?" 

They looked. A large, soft, 
fuzzy beast had come out from 
under the trees. It was reddish 
and had very big feet. It blinked 
at them brightly, climbed a 
transparent green rock, and 
started to whistle, not too tunefully, through its long Roman 
nose. 

Almost instantly, another 
emerged, a size smaller. Lowering 
its eyelids coquettishly, it began 
clapping its forepaws. 

"Charles, they must be the 
'critters' Burgee mentioned in 
that catalogue. Remember? I'm 
sure they're perfectly harmless." 

TWO more animals appeared 
and made for a rock of their 
own. And then there were, 'suddenly, dozens — all around the 
edge of the meadow. These were 
petite, creamy, with lavender 
ears. They came bounding forward in pairs, sat up and regard


68 




 



ed the Buttons solemnly. 

Charles began to relax. Somehow, Sugar Plum didn't seem 
half so enormous any longer, 
now that they weren't so alone. 

"I wonder if they could be 
tamed." Betty was wistful. 

"They're certain to be just full 
of fleas," sniffed Cousin Aurelia. 

The creatures were playful. 
As the Buttons walked over the 
meadow, they frolicked around 
them — 

But they also were very affectionate. As they frolicked, they 
flirted. Every once in a while, 
each pair would pause to rub 
noses, to murmur seductively, to 
nip one another. 

At first, Cousin Aurelia tried 
to pretend they weren't there. 
But finally she halted. "Charles 
Edward Button, I won't go a 
step farther till you drive those 
nasty things away. It's disgraceful. They're apt to do — anything!" 

Charles flushed under his netting. ^'Shoo!" he said ineffectively. "Beat it!" 

There was a swift patter of feet 
straight ahead and a figure 
flashed into view. She was slim. 
She was small, with a girdle and 
headdress of feathers. Her skin 
was sky-blue, and her ears were 
pointed, and her eyes were simply enormous. But she looked 
distressingly human. 

In an instant, she vanished. As 



the Buttons stood there goggling, 
they heard more running footsteps, somewhat heavier, and a 
scuffle, a giggle, a clear, tenor 
laugh, and then silence. 

"Why, that was a girl!" Betty 
gasped. 

"She was being pursued !" 
Charles exclaimed. "He — he 
caught her!" 

"Oooh !" moaned Cousin Aurelia, covering her eyes. "Charles, 
how could you? Enticing us here, 
saying it was uninhabited!" 

Then, before Charles could 
find a reply: 

"Uninhabited?" chuckled a 
deep male voice right behind 
them. "It certainly isn't. It's just 
uninhibited !" 

DLOWLY, the Buttons turned 
^ around. There, by an odd 
square tree, stood a man even 
bigger than Possett, smoking a 
pipe. He was middle-aged. He 
wore a heavy brown beard, khaki 
shorts, a deep coat of tan, and a 
self-possessed smile. 

He bowed. "Burgee is my name 
— Space Captain Alexander Burgee. Glad to make your acquaintance." 

"It's him !" screamed Cousin 
Aurelia. "And he's practically 
naked !" She pointed a cottongloved finger, began backing 
away. "You fiend, don't you 
come any nearer. Don't you touch 
me!" 



SUGAR PLUM 



The captain looked very surprised. "Why would I want to?" 

Her voice reached a new high 
and clung there. "You — you libertine! You may lead a riotous 
life with these natives, but you 
won't work your will on me. I'll 
lock myself in till the police can 
come from New Texas!" 

And, tripping and stumbling 
over her duster, she fled. 

As the door banged behind her, 
the captain nudged a large beast 
off a nearby rock, and sat down. 
"I can see that Earth hasn't 
changed," he remarked. "You 
tourists still seem to have the 
daffiest notions." He sounded 
quite hurt. "Look, these natives 
are nice little people. They're 
harmless. I call 'em my Sugar 
Plum, pixies, and sometimes we 
grin at each other. But that's all. 
They aren't much past the animal stage. Besides, they lay eggs. 
Oh, well — " he shrugged as the 
Buttons exchanged knowing 
looks — "I have plenty of room 
at the house and I guess you'll 
be permanent guests, so welcome 
to Sugar Plum, anyway." 

Betty said angrily, "Sugar 
Plum's ours. You didn't pay 
taxes and they sold it at auction. 
Charles has the deed in his pocket." 

"You poor, dumb kids!" The 
captain seemed really concerned. 
"You bought some fool bureaucrats error. I'm paid up in ad


vance. Come on down, you can 
see the receipt." 

"Aren't you clever?" said Betty scornfully. "Well, you won't 
trap us as easily as that. We 
don't need you or your house." 

"You just might want something to eat, or a hot, soapy shower, or a tight roof over you when 
it rains." 

The Buttons smiled triumphantly. They had their own 
house, with a DoItAll to do everything for them. 

"You can leave us alone, Mr. 
Pirate Burgee. Captain Possett 
told us your whole horrible story, 
and Cousin Aurelia is calling the 
police right this minute." 

"Possett?" The captain's face 
twitched. "Mike Possett, of the 
Beautiful Joe?" 

"That's right" Charles felt 
very superior. "Now you beat it 
before — " 

He didn't finish. From the 
house came a loud, anguished 
cry. 

They whirled. 

Cousin Aurelia, dishelved, 
without helmet or duster, was 
almost upon them. 

"Charles! It won't work!" 

She reached him, threw her 
arms round his neck and hung 
on. 

"I can't turn the servants on, 
or the teleprojection, or even the 
keys to the closets. Oh, Charles, 
we'll have nothing to eat, or to 



70 




 



drink, or to wear!" 

"That's impossible. DoItAlls 
never break down." 

"We can't live without it!" 
screeched Cousin Aurelia. "We're 
millions of miles from Boston ! 
We're marooned with that monster!" 

"O'URGEE'S long, low house 
was indecently plain, without 
even so much as a gimcrack or 
bit of gingerbread decoration. Its 
many wide windows looked out 
over a lake set with islands. Its 
living room had broad, cushioned 
couches and indolent chairs — all 
suspiciously comfortable. 

In exactly such houses, Charles 
knew, in the wicked old days, a 
fate worse than death had been 
practically part of the fixtures. 

"We shouldn't have let him 
persuade us," he worriedly told 
Betty. "Perhaps we'd have 
starved, but at least Cousin Aurelia wouldn't have locked herself alone into a strange pirate's 
bedroom !" 

"We've been here all afternoon," Betty pointed out, "and 
he hasn't tried anything yet. Besides, he helped carry those cases 
of hers and he gave her the keys 
himself. It's peculiar. Oh, Charles, 
do you suppose that — that it's 
me he's after?" 

Before he could answer, a robot 
came in, a practical, old-fashioned model with four arms for 



waiting at table. 

"Dinner is served." It snapped 
its aluminum jaws. "Come to the 
dining room, please." 

Reluctantly, they obeyed. 

"Whatever you do," whispered 
Charles warningly at the door, 
"don't let him ply you with 
liquor." 

The captain stood at the head 
of the table. He was in full 
evening dress, with a heavy goldnugget watch chain across his 
muscular middle. He smelled 
faintly of mothballs and looked 
very respectable. 

The Buttons examined the 
table. There wasn't a sign of absinthe or brandy or even champagne. There was nothing but 
water. 

"It's too bad your cousin won't 
join us," said the captain, seating them courteously. "I hope 
those cartons of hers have something tasty inside them." 

"They contain Dr. Stringfellow*s Vegetable Remedy and 
Tonic for Gentlewomen," replied Betty primly. "It is said to 
be very nourishing." 

Their host shuddered. Recovering, he clapped his hands 
sharply. "Oh, steward!" 

"Aye, aye, sir!" said the robot, 
appearing with a big silver tureen 
and setting it down on the table. 

The Buttons drew back. 

"I can see you don't trust me," 
laughed the captain. "So we'll 



SUGAR PLUM 



serve everything out in plain 
sight. You can shuffle the plates 
if you want to." He proceeded to 
ladle out a clear, fragrant soup. 
"There. Take whichever you 
want." 

The Buttons selected their 
plates. They picked up their 
spoons, dipped them nervously, 
made rowing motions. 

rpHE captain ate heartily, talking away between spoonfuls. 
He told them that Sugar Plum 
was surrounded by an ionized 
layer impervious to DoItAll 
waves. He said he had no use for 
such gadgets, or for the Age 
which produced them. 

"And why," he demanded, "did 
we become fake Victorians? Why 
are we worse than the real ones? 
I'll tell you. Because space was 
too big. It made people feel puny. 
They wanted a hole to crawl into 
— something small, safe and 
stuffy." 

As course followed course, he 
told them how he had retired 
from piracy after homesteading 
Sugar Plum. Alone with his robots, he had dismantled his vessel, using its engines for heating 
and lighting. He had done a good 
deal of exploring. 

The robot served something 
like lobster, and something like 
grouse, and a roast which might 
have been venison. It served vegetables in pink, pear-like clus


ters and long, golden pods. It 
served a crisp, succulent salad. 

Charles picked at his food, 
watching Betty with growing uneasiness. First, her appetite 
seemed to improve. Then her 
eyes started to sparkle, and the 
severe little corners of her mouth 
began to relax. Leaning forward 
intently, she became more and 
more absorbed in the captain. 

" — and so here I've been ever 
since," he said, as he finished his 
salad, "and Sugar Plum's just 
about perfect. Of course, it gets 
lonely at times, but — " 

Abruptly, Betty's hand darted 
out, grabbed the captain's beard. 

"Beaver!" she shouted, laughing and pulling. Then she settled 
back, blushing. "I've wanted to 
do that for years." 

Charles reeled. Here was a crisis! He started to rise; hesitated. 
Of course, he was shocked to the 
core, but, "Great Scott, she's 
pretty!" he thought; and at once 
he felt guilty. 

He stood up, trying hard to 
look angry. 

"Elizabeth," he announced, 
"you will leave this room — er — 
instantly." 

"Why?" giggled Betty. 

"Because ladies do not pull 
gentlemen's beards." 

The captain was holding his 
sides and rocking with laughter. 

"Now, now," he protested. 
"Let her get it out of her system. 



72 




 



'Beaver's' a splendid old custom, 
It's almost Victorian." 

Betty dimpled, resting her chin 
on the backs of her interlaced 
hands. "Don't pay any attention, 
Captain Burgee. Charlie's a horrid old -fuss -pot. Why shouldn't 
I yank at your beard? I like you." 

"Betty, the man is a pirate!" 

"Not any more. He's retired. 
You heard him say so yourself. 
Anyhow, I like him. I think he'd 
make an awfully nice husband 
for Cousin Aurelia." 

CHARLES reach£d for the water, and drained his glass in 
a spluttering gulp. 

"I think so, too," the captain agreed, looking pleased. "I 
thought so as soon as I saw her, 
She's exactly my type." He 
sighed. "But she does seem a 
little unfriendly. Do you suppose 
a guitar and some old-fashioned 
songs at her window might — well, 
make her want to get better acquainted?" 

Charles thought, "Not that 
sour old prune!" Surprised at 
himself, he swallowed the words 
just in time. 

Betty snickered. "Poor Cousin 
Aurelia! I simply can't get over 
her staying locked in with nothing but Vegetable Remedy. Why, 
it tastes just like shoe polish. 
And it's all because she's scared 
to death to eat or drink anything 
here. She believes that Sugar 



Plum's really an — an uninhibited 
planet!" 

She stopped. She stared at the 
captajn. "What's the matter?" 

"I'm afraid," he said, looking 
very serious, "that you don't understand. Your Cousin Aurelia is 
right." 

Betty wilted. "You can't mean 
it!" 

"I don't know exactly what 
does it. Maybe it's something in 
the water and air and food — " 

Charles stared at the plates on 
the table in horror. 

"It's nothing you need be 
afraid of," the captain went on. 
"You see, its effect just depends 
on the kind of person you are 
way inside." 

Betty began to perk up. She 
eyed Charles appraisingly. 

"Is Charles the right kind of 
person?" she asked. 

"I'm sure he is, and your 
cousin is, too, though she .keeps 
it pretty well hidden. If they 
weren't, Sugar Plum would soon 
let us know it, believe me." He 
grinned. "And now let's all go 
a-courtin*. I'll get my guitar and 
call Herman." 

He went to the door and whistled, and instantly a large reddish 
creature came lolloping in. It saw 
the guitar and blinked eagerly. 

Betty linked her arm in the 
captain's. "Come along, Charlie." 

Charles fumbled around. He 
was scared. 



SUGAR PLUM 



73 




 



Then Betty looked over her 
shoulder and smiled. It was a 
completely new smile. He had 
never seen it before. It made him 
tremble with apprehension. 

"You know," she said softly, 
"I think it'll sort of be fun being 
uninhibited." 

Charles knocked over a glass, 
and his chair, and he paused only 
to drink some more water. 

"So," he shouted, "do I!" 

"I suspected you might," said 
the captain. 

TOGETHER they went out on 
the porch and sat down in a 
swing; and, for a few moments, 
in silence, they watched Sugar 
Plum's two moons sailing through 
the strange, perfumed sky. The 
larger was celadon green ; the 
smaller, off-white, was glowing, 
gleaming. 

Finally, "Cousin Aurelia?" 
called Betty. 

"Betty, are you out in the dark 
with that man?" 

"Charles and I both are. But 
he isn't a pirate any more and 
he's really quite nice. Besides, 
he's going to sing to you." 

"You tell him to go away — far 
away. I've barricaded the window 
and I have my sharp scissors. I 
warn you, if he makes one false 
move — " 

"This is where I came in," remarked Charles. 

The captain settled back, tuned 



his guitar, and started to sing in 
a warm bass-baritone, with Herman whistling a tenor obbligato 
through his nose. Betty and 
Charles thought the effect was 
charming, even if Herman did 
tend to go a bit flat on the high 
notes. 

First, the captain sang Down 
by the Old Mill Stream and 
Sweet Genevieve. Then he tried 
a number of sentimental arias 
from the more respectable operas, and The Lost Chord, and 
several other old favorites. 

Occasionally, Cousin Aurelia 
sniffed loudly, but she said nothing until his serenade came to an 
end. 

"Betty!" she called. "Can you 
hear me?" 

"Do I have to?" 

"Tell that person out there that 
it has done him no good to make 
those ungodly noises. My fingers 
have been in my ears all the 
time." 

"You must've been really a 
sight," giggled Betty. 

"Betty! You — you sound different, somehow." 

"Oh, I am! So is Charles. We're 
both uninhibited now." 

There was one cry of horror 
from Cousin Aurelia and then 
silence. 

Betty turned to the captain. 
He looked downcast, and Herman did, too. 

"We'll just have to try some 


SUGAR PLUM 



75 



thing else, something clever," she 
told the captain. "Cousin Aurelia 
seems dead set against you. It's 
because- of your being a pirate, 
I guess." 

CHARLES and Betty spent the 
next couple of days avoiding 
any mention of the captain's former profession and "helping him 
think up new ways to uninhibit 
Cousin Aurelia. He tried singing 
again, this time with an augmented chorus of Herman's relations. When that also failed, he 
cooked her a fine mushroom omelette. Then he caught her a young 
animal with lavender ears to 
keep as a pet and he spent a 
whole evening reading Sonnefs 
irom the Portuguese aloud at her 
window. 

She responded with sniffs and 
with occasional scraping noises of 
furniture being moved to reinforce her defenses. Finally, to 
Betty's distress, she pushed out 
a note announcing that henceforth she would have nothing to 
do with the Buttons — and that 
no one could tell her that poems 
like those were Victorian. 

Before the third day was half 
over, the Captain was moping 
around, Charles was peevish, and 
Betty had started to worry and 
fret. 

So, in the late afternoon, they 
went on a picnic. Followed by 
Herman, and by the four-armed 



dining room robot carrying two 
wicker hampers, they walked 
around the lake to a broad grassy 
knoll where the strange square 
trees grew in a circle, and prisms 
of quartz leaned from the ground 
like Druids turned into stone. 
While they ate, the night advanced softly, its moons weaving 
crystalline shadows of celadon, 
rose, and old ivory. 

Betty waited until the last hint 
of daylight had vanished. Then, 
"It's lovely," she whispered. 
"Poor Cousin Aurelia, it'd all be 
so simple if she'd only come out, 
but — oh, I'm afraid that it's 
hopeless!" 

' 'Hopeless ?" Charles snorted . 
"It's easy. We'll break into her 
room, me and Burgee, and hold 
her while you pour some of Sugar 
Plum's water down her gullet. 
She'll be fixed up before she finds 
out what hit her." 

"We mustn't do that," the captain said stiffly. "We can't employ violence." 

"Look who's talking!'' Charles 
was amused. "An old pirate like 
you. Robbing ships, making passengers walk the plank into space, 
shooting people with ray guns, 
and — " 

"Shh!" Betty warned. "Charles, 
that isn't polite. You know he's 
sensitive about — " 

The captain seemed to be 
strangling. "And I thought it was 
snobbery /" Then he exploded 



76 




 



with laughter. He lay back on 
the grass and he howled. 

The Buttons stared in amazement, and some creatures came 
out of the trees to see what the 
uproar was all about. 

'TlHE captain sat up. "What 
I century is this?" he asked. 

"The Twenty-second, of 
course," answered Betty. "But — 
but why?" 

"I just wondered. I'll tell you 
later." He controlled himself with 
an effort. "But we really mustn't 
use force on Aurelia, even in such 
a good cause. It might turn her 
into the wrong kind of person." 

"Turn her?" Betty repeated 
sadly. "I'm afraid that she already is. I don't think she'll ever 
come out. I'm afraid she'll do 
something desperate." 

"I'm worried, too," the captain 
admitted, "but I'm certain she is 
the right kind. The wrong kind 
of people can't live here. Sugar 
Plum doesn't like them." 

Betty and Charles both looked 
puzzled. 

"I'll try to explain. It happens 
within a few hours, even if they 
aren't uninhibited. If they are, 
then it's practically instantaneous. It's a — " 

He broke off and looked up at 
the sky with a frown. There was 
an angry red glow right above 
them, a far-distant roar. 

They leaped to their feet. The 



glow brightened swiftly. It seemed to be headed straight for them. 
The sound filled the air. 

"We have visitors!" shouted 
the captain. 

"Wh-who?" stammered Betty. 
"The police?" 

"They don't use braking jets 
any more. It's an obsolete 
freighter." 

"Oh!" Betty put her hands to 
her face in terror. "It's the Beautiful Joe. That man Possett — he's 
coming back after Cousin Aurelia!" 

The red glow passed to the 
northward. They saw the ship's 
shape for a moment, spurting 
flame, slowing. Then it dropped 
out of sight. The ground shuddered briefly. There was quiet. 

The captain grabbed Betty's 
arm. "They're down in the clearing. Quick ! When he dropped 
you, did Possett take anything 
with him?" 

"Just a fresh supply of water." 

"My God!" blurted Charles. 
"That means they're — " 

"Uninhibited!" yelled the cap-tain. "And theyYe the wrong kind 
of people. Betty ! Charles! Can 
you run? Hey , Steward , give 
them a hand!" 

"Aye, aye, sir," snapped the 
robot, hoisting the hampers and 
reaching an elbow to each of the 
Buttons. 

"Then let's go. I hope we can 
make it in time to save them!" 



SUGAR PLUM

"Them?" gulped Charles, as 
the robot started to run. 

But the captain already was 
too far ahead to have heard him. 

PULLED by the untiring robot, Charles and Betty made 
very good time, but they couldn't 
catch up with the captain. They 
had to make several stops to get 
their wind back, and they were 
still half a mile from the house 
when they heard her. 

"Help! Murder! Police ! Save 
me!" screamed Cousin Aurelia. 

"He — he's got her!" puffed 
Charles, as the shrieks died away. 
"Hurry !" 

When they got to the house, it 
was empty. Not even Herman 
was there. In the living room and 
the hall, there were signs of a 
titanic struggle. The door of 
Cousin Aurelia's room hung wide 
open. 

"Look!" Charles gave it a great 
goldfish stare. "She unlocked it 
herself!" 

. "He probably told her — he was 
rescuing her — from the pirate," 
panted Betty. 

"We — we'll have to go on — " 
Charles felt his legs start to collapse — "to the clearing." 

The robot put two arms around 
him, and one around Betty. 

"You will rest for three minuts," it stated, leading them to 
the living room and seating them 
gently. "I will bring brandy." 





 




SUGAR PLUM 



The brandy was welcome. They 
drank it in gulps, and worried 
about Cousin Aurelia, and the 
robot fanned them considerately 
while they did so. \ 

Then, again, they were off. In 
less than ten minutes, they looked 
down on the valley, on the clearing. They caught sight of the 
Beautiful Joe. The voice of the 
waterfall reached them. 

And so did another one. A 
man's voice. A deep one. 

"Ow!" it yelled hoarsely. "Let 
me up! Ow! Let go!" 

Charles moaned. "We shouldn't 
have waited for brandy. Now 
they're killing him, too!" 

With the robot behind them, 
they raced down the hill, splashed through the stream, broke 
through a circle of giggling Sugar 
Plum natives and goggle-eyed 
creatures. 

"Don't give up!" croaked 
Charles. "We're coming!" 

On the grass were four figures. 
Two were thrashing around and 
being sat on. Two were doing 
the sitting. 

The Buttons braked to a stop. 
Something was radically wrong. 
The larger of the two thrashing 
figures was being sat on by Cousin Aurelia! 

"Try to kidnap me, will you?" 
Slap. "Make me throw myself 
into that pool!" Slap. "And swalJow a gallon of water and have 
to drag myself out!" Slap-stap
79 



slap. "You will, will you?" 

"Ow!" cried the figure. "Leggo!" 

AURELIA looked over her 
shoulder. She spied Charles 
and Betty. 

"Hey!" she shouted. "Bear a 
hand here with Possett!" 

"You don't have to hold him," 
called Captain Burgee, dismounting from Loopy the mate. "He 
can't get away. Sugar Plum's got 
him." 

They both rose and the two 
writhing figures continued to 
writhe. 

"They're scratching," Charles 
exclaimed. 

He wasn't quite right. The 
skipper and the mate of the 
Beautiful Joe were trying to 
scratch, but they didn't have 
enough hands. They were groaning, and bleating, and begging 
for aid as they wriggled. 

Cousin Aurelia gave Possett a 
push with her foot. 

"I'm soaked to the skin," she 
announced. "Betty, help me off 
with this dress. If I don't wring 
my petticoat out, I'll catch something." 

"Why, Cousin Aurelia!" 
Charles blurted. "In front of the 
captain?" 

"And why not?" she demanded. "I have undies on, don't I?" 

The captain broke in, his voice 
urgent. "We've got to get these 



characters back aboard in a hurry! They can't live on Sugar 
Plum; they're the wrong kind of 
people. I started to tell you. 
They're allergic to the critters, 
the trees, the natives — to everything here. You, Steward!" He 
beckoned. "Call the crew of the 
Beautiful Joe." 

The robot ran to the ship. It 
whistled. Immediately, four other 
robots appeared. 

"Bosun," said the captain to 
the one in the lead, "Captain 
Possett is ill. He is — er — delirious. The mate, too. Carry them 
in. And take off quickly for New 
Texas." 

"Aye, aye, sir." The bosun saluted. 

They lifted up Possett, who 
was grunting and swearing. They 
hoisted the weasel-faced mate. 
The hatches clanged shut. Fire 
burst from the stern. The ship 
lifted. 

When there was quiet again, 
Cousin Aurelia looked at the captain. She examined him carefully. 

"Hm-ra-m," she murmured to 
Betty. "Not bad. Not bad at all!" 

Then, "Alexander Burgee," she 
declared, "every bit of this is 
your fault. If I hadn't escaped 
from that man and jumped in the 
pool — well, I don't know what 
might* ve happened. The least you 
can do is carry me back to your 
house."

AT midnight, Charles and Betty sat in the living room. 
They hadn't had time to get used 
to the change in Cousin Aurelia 
and they still looked at her unbelievingly. She was wearing a 
gay housecoat of Betty's, too 
tight in just the right places. She 
had let down her hair, tied it 
with a ribbon, and she'd put on 
a gay smear of lipstick. She was 
exceedingly merry. 

"I can't imagine how I stood 
it," she was saying, "for so many 
years. I mean, being such an old 
frump." She laughed brightly. 
"Why, I was almost as bad as 
poor Charlie!" 

"Well, at least I never locked 
myself in to get away from a pirate," Charles retorted. 

The captain stood up with a 
chuckle. "Say, that reminds me." 
He went to a bookcase, opened a 
thick volume, and gave it to 
Charles. "I want you to read 
something here." 

Charles saw that it was Jane's 
Dictionary of Space Transportation. He looked up enquiringly. 

The captain was pointing at a 
word. 

"'Pirate,'" Charles read, 
sounding puzzled. " 'Pirate, originally a criminal who attacked 
and robbed ships at sea (see : 
Earth, planet) now obsolete in 
this sense. At present, term applied to — ' " Charles hesitated — 
" 'to persons engaged in space 



salvage, especially to captains of 
vessels employed in such work.' " 

Charles turned red. Betty flushed. Cousin Aurelia started laughing her head off. 

"Times change," the captain 
said soberly. "Do you want me 
to show you my license?" 

The Buttons were much too 
embarrassed to answer. 

"Well, if you don't, I hope 
you'll excuse us. Aurelia and I 
would like to sit in the swing and 
look at the stars for a while." 

"I want to be told just how 
far away Boston is," she said as 
he helped her to rise. She wrinkled her nose. "I'm certainly glad 
that here on Sugar Plum we're 
safe from the wrong kind of' people — all those horrible Victorians." 

The captain's arm went around 
her. 

He winked at the Buttons. 

"A few of thern weren't so bad," 
he said gently. "A few of the real 
ones." 

And, as they left, he slipped 
the copy of Sonnets from the 
Portuguese into his pocket. 

"Well, now that we've sort of 
lost Cousin Aurelia," said Betty, 
"I wish I could have one of these 
adorable animals on Sugar Plum 
for my very own. As a pet, you 
know. It might help as a substitute for Cousin Aurelia 's company." 

"And what's wrong with me for 



SUGAR PLUM 



81 



a substitute?" Charles wanted to 
know. "It seems to me that you 
can forget Cousin Aurelia for a 
change and give me a little consideration." 

She looked at him appraisingly 
and then at her watch. 

"I never thought of that," she 
said. "It's time for bed." 

LATER, she sat up, studied 
him hard for a moment, and 
shook her head wistfully. 

"Oh, Charles, you'd be per


fect," she said, "if you only had 
lavender ears." 

"That shouldn't be much trouble," he answered gravely. "I'll 
signal a passing spaceship, get to 
New Texas and have my ears 
tattooed. Good enough?" 

She nuzzled against his neck. 

"Wonderful, darling. It would 
make you look so — so Bohemian!" 

It was the finest compliment 
Charles had ever received. 

— It. BRETNOR

A Thought 
for Tomorrow 

Any intolerable problem has a 
way out—the more impossible, 
the likelier it is sometimes! 



By ROBERT E. GILBERT 

Illustrated by 
DAVID STONE 



IORD POTTS frowned at the 
rusty guard of his saber, 
A and the metal immediately 
became gold-plated. Potts reined 
his capricious black stallion closer" 
to the first sergeant. 

"Report !" the first sergeant 
bellowed. 

"Fourth Hussars, all present!" 
"Eighth Hussars, all present!" 
"Eleventh Hussars, all present!" 

~ "Thirteenth Hussars, all present!" 

"Seventeenth Lancers, all present!" 

The first sergeant's arm flashed 
in a vibrating salute. "Sir," he 
said, "the brigade is formed." 

Potts concentrated on the sergeant; but, aside from blue eyes, 
a black mustache, and luminous 
chevrons, the man's appearance 
remained vague. His uniform had 
no definite color, except for moments when it blushed a brilliant 
red, and his headgear expanded 
and contracted so rapidly that 
Potts could not be certain whether 
he wore a shako or a tarn. 

"Take your post," Potts said. 
"Men!" he shouted. "We're going 
to charge at those guns!" 

"Oh, Oi say!" wailed a small 
private with scarcely any features 
but a mouth. "Them Russians'U 
murder us!" 

"Yours not to reason why," 
Potts said. "Draw sabers! 
Charge !" 



A THOUGHT FOR TOMORROW 



83 



The ground quaked under the 
beat of twenty -four hundred 
hoofs. As the first puffs of smoke 
billowed from the entrenchments 
half a league away, Potts remembered that he had forgotten to 
give orders to the lancers. Should 
he tell them to couch lances, or 
lower lances, or aim lances, or — 

"F>. T. boys, let's go. Out to 
the door," a bored voice 
called. 

Potts opened his eyes. He 
sighed. Again he had failed. The 
dayroom had hardly changed. 
The chairs were all pushed together in the center of the floor, 
and two patients with brooms 
swept little ridges of dirt and 
cigarette butts toward the door. 
Potts sat slouched in one of the 
chairs and raised his feet as the 
sweepers passed. 

"Orville Potts, out to the door," 
the bored voice said. 

Potts gave Wilhart a killing 
look when the big attendant, immaculate in white duck trousers 
and short-sleeved linen shirt, 
passed through to the porch. 
Potts wondered why so many of 
the attendants resembled cleanshaven gorillas. 

He arose leisurely from the 
chair, shuffled around the sweepers, and entered the hall. A pair 
of huge, gray, faded cotton pants 
draped his spindling legs in 
wrinkled folds, and an equally 



faded khaki shirt hung from his 
stooped shoulders. Potts had not 
combed his hair in three days. 
He pushed the tangled brown 
mass out of his eyes and threaded 
between the groups of men that 
jammed the hall, smoking and 
waiting to go to the shoe shop, 
or the paint detail, or psychodrama, or merely waiting. 

At the locked door to the stairs. 
Potts stopped and glared at the 
six patients already assembled. 

"Hello, Orville Potts," said another long-armed, barrel-chested 
attendant. This one wore a black 
necktie, and. so far as Potts knew, 
had no name but Joe. Potts ignored Joe. 

The attendant pulled a ring of 
keys attached to a long heavy 
chain from his pocket and unlocked the door, when Wilhart 
brought the rest of the P. T. boys. 

"Downstairs, when I call your 
name," Joe said, and read from 
the charts attached to his clipboard. 

When his name was called, 
Potts stepped through to the 
landing and descended the top 
stairs. Joe locked the door. 

Potts looked up at Danny Harris, who stood motionless on the 
landing. While Joe weaved down 
the crowded steps, Wilhart took 
Harris by the arm and pushed 
him. 

"Let's go," he said. "Here, Orville Potts, take Danny Harris 



84 




 



downstairs with you." 

Potts said, "Do your own dragging.'* 

"Well!" Wilhart gasped. "Hear 
that, Joe? Orville Potts is talking 
this morning!" 

Joe turned up a red, grim face. 
"He'll talk a lot before I'm 
through with him," he promised. 

The sixteen patients from Ward 
J descended the stairs, were 
counted through another door, 
and formed a ragged column of 
twos on the concrete walk outside. 
With Joe leading and Wilhart 
guarding the' rear, the little 
formation moved across the great 
grassy quadrangle enclosed by 
the buildings and ' connecting 
roofed corridors of the hospital. 

Potts tried to close his ears to 
Wilhart's incessant urging of 
Danny Harris. Harris would do 
little of his own volition, but 
Potts was tired of acting as his 
escort. 

The blue morning sky supported but a few brilliant clouds. 
Potts wished he were up there, 
or anywhere except going to P. T. 
He hated P. T. It terrified him. 
Potts closed his eyes. 

MAJOR Orville Potts stood in 
the soft grass and rested a 
gloved hand on the upper wing 
of his flying machine. 

"Sir," he said, "with my invention, the Confederacy will soon 
put the Yankees to rout." 



The general stroked his gray 
goatee and pursed his lips. Potts 
felt pleased that every detail of 
the general's uniform stood out 
in bold clarity. The slouch hat, 
gray coat, red sash, and black 
jackboots were more real than 
life. Of course the surrounding 
landscape was a green blur, but 
increased " concentration would 
clear that. 

The general said, "Ah'm doubtful, Majah. Balloons, Ah undahstand. Hot aiah natuahlly rises, 
but this contraption seems too 
heavy to fly." 

"No heavier, in proportion, than 
a kite, sir," Potts explained. 

The crude mountaineer captain, standing slightly behind the 
general, snickered. 

"Hit won't work nohow," he 
predicted. "Jist like that there 
Williams repeatin' cannon at 
Seven Pines. Ain't even got no 
steam engine fur as I kin see." 

Potts said, "This is a new type 
engine. It operates on a formula 
of my own, which I have named 
gasoline. Now, if you gentlemen 
will excuse me, I shall proceed 
with the demonstration." 

Potts climbed into the cockpit. 
A touch of the starter set the 
1,000 h.p. radial engine roaring. 
He waved to the gaping officers 
and opened the throttle. The biplane whisked down the field and 
rocketed into the blue morning 
sky. 



A THOUGHT FOR TOMORROW 



85 



Too late, Potts saw the buzzard 
soaring dead ahead. He shoved 
the stick forward, but the black 
bird rushed toward his face in 
frightening magnification. 




lOTTS opened his eyes. He 
had walked into a wall. 



"What's the matter, Orville 
Potts?" Joe asked. "Vou sleepwalking? Get in there! I'll wake 
you tip." 

Joe shoved Potts through the 
door marked physical therapy 
and into the dressing room. With 
sixteen patients in the process of 
disrobing, the small room presented a scene of wild, indecent 
activity. Potts squirmed through 
the thrashing tangle to a bench 
against the wall. He sat down and 
retrieved a shoe. 

Potts almost felt the currents 
surging through the neurons of 
his brain and sensed a throbbing 
on the inside of his skull. Twice 
this morning, he had tried to 
break through the physical barrier and had failed. Even with a 
minimum of thought, the reasons 
for failure became obvious. 

Lack of intimate detail seemed 
the principle cause. In his attempt 
to reach the Crimean War and 
lead the Charge of the Light Brigade, he had been hampered by 
his ignorance of correct uniforms 
and commands. He did not know 
"at what time of day the charge 
had taken place, the weather con


ditions, the appearance of the terrain, or even the exact date. He 
believed it was about 1855, but 
he wouldn't risk a dime bet on 
his guess. Perhaps an attempt to 
return to the past was certain to 
fail. Surely the past had happened, was settled, inviolate. 
Someone named Lord Cardigan, 
not Orville, Lord Potts, had led 
the charge. 

Inventing an airplane during 
the Civil War also had no chance 
of success. No such thing actually happened, and, if it had, the 
plane would have been more 
crude than the Wright brothers' 
machine. Furthermore, Potts was 
no aviator. Success, if any, lay in 
the future. The future was yet to 
come, and Potts could mold 
events to his liking. Or perhaps 
he could move his body in space, 
instead of time. He could think 
himself out of the hospital. 

"Orville Potts, get those clothes 
off!" Wilhart ordered. Potts 
slowly removed his faded garments. He took his place at the 
end of the line of naked men 
leading to the needle shower. 

Joe stood in all his glory at 
what Potts called the P. T. machine. The apparatus was a marble box with rows of knobs and 
gauges and a pair of rubber hoses 
on the top. Potts felt sure that 
Joe took a sadistic delight in his 
work. As the line moved forward, 
he glanced at the attendant's 



86 




 



florid face, tight smiling lips and 
squinted eyes. Potts shuddered. 
No member of the hospital staff 
had ever condescended to explain 
to Potts the exact purpose of the 
P. T. bath, other than that it 
would make him feel good. It 
only frightened Potts. The correct procedure was that the patient stepped between the pipes 
of the needle shower and washed 
himself. Then the attendant 
turned off the shower and sluiced 
the patient with powerful streams 
of water from the hoses. v 

The routine seemed senseless 
and innocent enough, but Potts 
had heard whispered conversations in the night that filled him 
with horror. The P. T. machine, 
rumor said, was actually an instrument of torture and death. 
The water pressure could be increased to two thousand pounds, 
enough to push out a man's eyes 
or break his bones. Instead of 
water, the hoses could spit fire 
like a flamethrower. Acid could 
spray from the shower. Potts had 
even heard that Joe had killed 
seven men in the P. T. bath. How 
much of this was true, Potts did 
not know. When he saw bodies 
turn suddenly red under a rain 
of hot water, or writhe and tremble as if being whipped, he could 
believe all of. it. 

The line advanced slowly, like 
a gang of criminals going to the 
gas chamber Potts grimly deter


mined to think himself out of the 
hospital at once, for who knew 
when fire instead of water would 
spout from the hoses? If he recalled some place outside, in exact detail, Potts knew he could 
become all mind and project himself there. He must recall everything, scents, temperature, the 
ground beneath his feet, precise 
colors. Potts concentrated. 

He tried to remember the home 
he had not seen for three months. 
He received a dim impression of 
a tiny crowded apartment and a 
wife growing increasingly indifferent. He could not even remember the color of her eyes, or 
whether the living room contained 
one easy chair or two. He would 
have to project himself to another 
place, one that did not seem like 
a vague dream. 

Potts saw that his bath would 
come next. Danny Harris stood 
in the spray and stared stupidly 
at the tile floor. Potts looked at 
Joe. A wide smile that revealed 
two gold teeth creased the burly 
attendant's face. Hairy hands 
turned off the needle shower, 
twisted two more knobs, and 
picked up the twin hoses. Joe 
stood like the villain in a Western 
movie, blazing away with two 
guns, and shot s thin powerful 
streams of water against Harris's 
spine. Harris shrieked, though he 
rarely uttered a sound outside the 
P. T. bath. As the icy water raked 



A THOUGHT FOR TOMORROW 



87 



him from head to heels, he yelled 
and danced. 

"Turn around," Joe commanded. 

Harris pivoted and wailed, and 
Joe basted him on all sides with 
water. Potts watched fascinated 
as the thin body turned alternately blue with cold and red 
under the stinging water. He 
would not endure that again this 
morning. He knew now one place 
he could sense and visualize in 
complete detail. 

"All right," said Joe, laying 
down his hoses. "Let's go, Orville 
Potts!" 

Harris reeled, like a man rescued from drowning, into the 
dressing room, and Potts took his 
place between the four vertical 
pipes of the needle shower. From 
innumerable holes in the pipes, 
powerful jets of water spouted 
against his body. He stood with 
his back turned to the machine 
and made no attempt to wash. 
He never did — he saw no point 
in bathing without soap. 

Potts thought of the Ward J 
dayroom, the room in which he 
had spent much of his time for 
the past three months. He visualized the maroon chairs with 
metal arms and legs, the green 
cretonne curtains, the cream 
walls, the black-and-red inlaid 
linoleum floor glinting with spots 
of old wax. He sensed a stale odor 
of tobacco smoke, furniture pol

ish, and perspiration. He heard 
the talk of patients engaged in 
perpetual games of rook. He felt 
his thighs, hips, and back pressing 
against one of the chairs, and his 
feet on the smooth floor. 

"Now, Orville Potts," Joe 
jeered, "let's hear you sing like 
Danny Harris!" 

But Potts wasn't there. 

POTTS opened his eyes. He 
had always wondered how it 
would feel, but he had felt nothing. In the same instant, he stood 
tensed, waiting for the water, and 
he sat in a chair in the Ward J 
dayroom. Directly in front of 
him, a nurse played rook with 
three of the patients grouped 
around a square table. Not many 
patients were in the room at this 
hour, and no attendant stood 
guard. The nurse turned her head 
slightly. She gasped, shoved back 
her chair and ran to the porch. 
Nasen, the ward attendant, 
charged through the door she had 
used. 

"Orville Potts!" he cried. 
"Where's your clothes?" 

Potts then noticed that he was 
completely naked and wet. 

Nasen dragged Potts from the 
chair, ,applied a light hammerlock, and marched his captive 
from the room. "Did you come 
over here from P. T. like that?" 
he asked. "How'd you get out?" 

Potts went along willingly 



THOUGHT FOR TOMORROW 



enough, but without answering. 

Nasen unlocked the door to 
the shower room and thrust Potts 
within. "Stay right there," he 
said. As he was locked in. Potts 
heard the attendant call, "Frank, 
go tell Dr. Bean that Orville 
Potts slipped out of P. T. with 
no clothes on. I don't know how. 
He must have stolen a key." 

Potts took a towel from the 
shelf, sat on the bench, and 
rubbed his hair with the towel. 
He hoped they all went batty trying to learn how he had escaped. 
He thought most of the attendants should be patients anyhow. 

Clutching a pile of clothing and 
a pair of slippers, Nasen returned. "Put these on," he said. 
"Orville Potts, you're in trouble 
nd\v. What did you do with the 
key?" 

Potts struggled into a tight blue 
shirt minus most of the buttons. 
"I didn't have a key." 

"You're talking?" 

"I can talk when I want to," 
Potts admitted. "I just never 
want to." 

Nasen said, "That's more words 
than I've heard from you all at 
one time. Why did you come back 
stark naked like that?" 

"I thought my way out," Potts 
explained, pulling on the trousers 
that had evidently been tailored 
for a giant. 

"Oh, you thought your way 
out. Put those slippers on." 



Joe and Wilhart, flushed and 
panting, charged into the shower 
room. 

"There he is! Grab him!" Joe 
yelled. He seized Potts' arms and 
pulled them behind in a brutal 
double hammerlock. 

"He's not giving any trouble," 
Nasen said. "What happened, 
Joe?" 

"Damn if I know. He was in 
the shower, and I turned my head 
for a second. Next thing I knew, 
he was gpne. What'd you find on 
him — a key or a lock-pick or 
something like that?" 

Nasen grinned. "He didn't have 
even that much on when 1 first 
saw him. "He came into the day 
room and sat down, and Miss 
Davis like to threw a fit." 

Wilhart tossed a bundle on the 
floor. "There's nothing in his own 
clothes but a pack of cigarettes." 

"Where's the key. Orville 
Potts?" Joe grated, squeezing 
Potts's arms. "You know what's 
going to happen to you? You'll 
get the pack room, or maybe 
Ward D. How would you like 
Ward D. Orville Potts?" 

Nasen said. "If he had a key. 
he—" 

"You better run along, Nasen," 
Joe said. "I think Dr. Bean wants 
to talk to you." 

"Well, I— uh — " Looking worried, Nasen left the shower room. 

Wilhart handed Joe a towel. 

"Leave me alone!" Potts yelled.

GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTION 



Joe wrapped the towel around 
Potts's neck- "Where's the key, 
Orville Potts?" 

"Help!" Potts cried. The towel 
tightened. 

With rapidly dimming vision, 
he saw Wilhart assume a stance. 
A huge fist thudded against his 
shrunken stomach. He tried to 
scream, but the towel cut off all 
air and sound. Again and again, 
the fist struck. 

Potts found himself sitting on 
the floor, gulping air into starved 
lungs. For a moment, he hoped 
he had managed another transportation, but the two white-clad 
human gorillas leering down at 
him proved he had not left the 
shower room. 

"Get up," Joe said. 

They dragged Potts to his feet. 
Nasen opened the door, clamped 
his teeth, and then opened his 
mouth to say, "Dr. Bean wants 
Orville Potts. I'll—" 

"I'll take him," Joe said. 

Potts winced as spatulate fingers almost met through his biceps. 
His feet barely touched the floor 
cf the corridor when Joe marched 
him to the office of Dr. Lawrence 
D. Bean. 

TAR. BEAN, a thin bald man, 
sat behind a maple desk and 
peered at Potts over spectacles 
attached to a black ribbon. Joe 
shut the door and leaned against 
it. 



* "I've been hearing things about 
you, Orville," Dr. Bean said. 
"We'll have a little examination. 
Now, hold your right arm out 
straight, close your eyes, and 
touch the end of your nose with 
'your index finger." 

"Can't we do without the foolishness?" Potts asked. He sank 
into the chair beside the doctor's 
desk and gently rubbed his bruised arm. 

The doctor looked slightly 
startled, but said, "I'm pleased 
to hear you speaking again, Orville. If you continue to talk to 
people, take an interest in your 
surroundings, write home, you'll 
be out of here very shortly." 

"He choked me," Potts said, 
pointing a thumb at Joe. "He 
choked me with a towel, and the 
other one, that Wilhart, hit me 
in the stomach." 

Dr. Bean's spectacles jumped 
from his nose and dangled by the 
ribbon. He focused a pair of 
bleary eyes on Potts and said, 
"You know they didn't, Orville. 
The attendants are here for your 
benefit. They would never subject a patient to physical violence." 

Potts laughed for the first time 
since he was hospitalized. He said, 
"Why don't you ask me what I 
did with the key?" 

"What did you do with the key, 
Orville?" 

"Talk about monomaniacs!" 



A THOUGHT FOR TOMORROW 



91 



Potts snickered. "You all have 
one-track minds. You can't think 
of any way I could have escaped 
without stealing a key. Is any 
key actually missing? Did anyone see me crossing the grass or 
coming through the halls? I'll 
tell you how I did it. Exactly 
how. You already think I'm nuts, 
so it won't matter." 

Again, Potts pointed at Joe. 
"Laughing boy here can bear me 
out. He was about to whip me 
with his ice water, and I vanished. I vanished from the shower 
and materialized in the dayroom"' 

Dr. Bean replaced his glasses 
and grabbed a pad and pencil. 

"That's fight, Doc," Potts approved. "Write it down. I'm 
giving you a better break than 
you ever gave me. I've been in 
this hospital four times, and no 
doctor ever sat down and explained what was wrong with me, or 
tried to learn why. There was 
something about combat fatigue, 
whatever that is. over in Italy. 
Otherwise, I don't know anything. If I so much as raise my 
voice or break a dish at home, my 
wife has me shipped back here 
as dangerously psychotic, or psycho-neurotic, or something. 
Which makes it nice for her. 

"And what do you do' when I 
come back? You give me electric 
shock treatments and have your 
sadists whip me with P. T. baths. 



as if torture could cure a sick 
mind! Maybe there's nothing 
wrong with my brain. Maybe it's 
just different from yours, or this 
jerk's, if he has a brain." 

"Never mind, Joe," Dr. Bean 
cautioned in a theatrical aside. 
"Just stand by." 

Potts smiled and said, "Take 
it all down. Then you can check 
your notes and decide if it's 
schizophrenia, or catatonia, or 
psychasthenia, or what not. I 
know a little about mental diseases from reading, and I'll explain my theory the best I can." 

OOTTS tapped his forehead 
with a forefinger and asked, 
"What is a brain? You'll say it's 
an organ occupying the skull and 
forming the center of the nervous 
system, and the seat of intellect, 
or some such thing. I don't think 
so. It generates electricity. You 
know that. A nerve impulse is a 
wave of electricity started and 
conducted by a nerve cell. You 
can test it. You've made brainwave patterns of some of the boys 
in the ward. 

"The brain transforms energy 
into thought, or thought into energy. I'm sitting here thinking 
and not moving my body at all. 
My brain is transforming electric 
energy'into thought. You're writing, and your thoughts guide the 
movement of your hand. Thought 
into energy." 



92 




 



Dr. Bean turned a page and 
continued to scribble rapidly. 
Potts heard Joe move and ffelt 
the big attendant's presence behind his chair^ 

Potts said, "The ability to 
think improves with use, like a 
muscle growing stronger with yse. 
The first time you memorize a 
poem, it's a hard job. If you keep 
on memorizing, it becomes easier, 
until you read a poem a couple 
of times and you have it. The 
same goes for remembering. I'll 
bet you can't even remember how 
your breakfast tasted and smelled this morning. Probably not 
even what you ate. 

"I practice remembering with 
all the senses. How things look 
and taste and smell. Exact colors, 
shadows, size, impressions. Think 
of an airplane, and you probably 
think of a little silver thing in 
the sky. Actually, an airplane is 
much bigger than that, so your 
mental picture of an airplane is 
all wrong. An airplane gives me 
a certain impression. I have it 
only when looking at one. Maybe it's an unrecognized sense. I 
have an entirely different impression when I'm looking at a horse." 

Dr. Bean threw down his pencil, caught his falling glasses, 
drew a handkerchief from his 
breast pocket, and polished them. 

"Too deep for you, Doc?" Potts 
inquired. "Well, just assume that 
my brain is a more powerful gen


erator and transformer than any 
you ever saw. I've developed it 
by memorizing, remembering, 
visualizing, working problems in 
my head, and so on. I've been 
trying to make my brain take 
complete control of my body. The 
body is composed of atoms, and 
the atoms are electrical charges, 
protons and electrons. Therefore, 
you're nothing but electricity in 
the shape of a man. 

"By changing myself to pure 
thought, or pure electricity, I 
believed that I could escape to 
the past. Get away from this age 
where a man is suspected of insanity if he so much as mislays 
his checkbook or kicks his dog. 
People didn't used to be crazy 
unless they went around hacking 
their relatives with an ax. 

"I tried to meet Columbus 
when he rowed ashore from the 
Santa Maria. I tried to watch the 
Battle of Bunker Hill. I tried to 
lead the Charge of the Light Brigade. I tried to invent an airplane 
during the Civil War. I always 
failed, because I didn't have 
enough sensory knowledge of the 
period, and I couldn't change the 
past. 

"I succeeded in P. T. because I 
transported myself through space 
instead of time. I knew every detail of the day room, so it worked. 
My brain reduced my body to 
its elemental charges in the P. T. 
bath and reassembled it - in the 



A THOUGHT FOR TOMORROW 



93 



dayroom. Something like radio, 
with the brain acting as sending 
set and receiver. Maybe we 
should call it philosophy, Doc. 
What is reality? If I sit here in 
your office but imagine I'm sitting in the dayroom, until the 
chair in the dayroom becomes 
more real than this, where am I 
actually sitting?" 

Dr.,Bean stood up, adjusted his 
glasses, and said, "Orville, I am 
going to do as you asked. I am 
going to tell you exactly what is 
wrong with you. You are suffering from distorted perception 
— illusions and hallucinations, 
disorientation. You are also becoming an exhibitionist and are 
developing a persecution complex. 
I thought, when you first came 
in, that you had improved. But 
if^ou don't pull yourself together 
and try to get well, you'll be in 
here a long time." 

Potts's chair overturned as he 
thrust himself up. He placed his 
thin hands on the desk and said, 
"You psychiatrists can't see an 
inch in front of your nose! All 
you can do is quote a textbook. 
If anybody mentions mental telepathy, or predicting the future, 
or a sense of perception, you classify them as insane. You think 
you've reduced the mind to a set 
of rules, but you're still in kindergarten! I'll prove every word 
I said! I'll vanish into the future! 
I can't change the past, but the 



future hasn't happened yet! I 
can imagine my own!" 

Joe grabbed the fist that Potts 
shook under the doctor's nose and 
pinned the patient's arms behind 
his back. 

"Take him upstairs to Ward K, 
Joe," Dr. Bean said. "To the pack 
room. That should calm him." 

"So long, moron!" Potts called. 

"Let's go, Orville Potts," Joe 
said. "We're going to fix you up 
just like an ice cream soda." 

"You won't pack me in ice," 
Potts promised. His thin body 
twisted in pain. 

He closed his eyes tight and 
concentrated. 

Joe's great hands clamped into 
fists when Potts disappeared. 

OOTTS opened his eyes. He 
■1 lay face down on a padded acceleration couch with broad 
straps across his brawny back 
and legs. Before his face, a second hand swept around a clock 
toward a red zero. Potts twisted 
his head slightly in the harness 
and looked at the beautiful young 
woman strapped to the couch on 
his right. A shrieking warning 
siren blared through the spaceship. 

The woman smiled. 

"Hia, ked," she said in strange 
new accents. "Secure your dentures. Next stop. Alpha Centaur us!"

The Altar 



at Midnight 



By C. M. KORNBLUTH 




Doing something for humanity 
may be fine — for humanity — 
but rough on the individual! 




HE had quite a rum-blossom on him for a kid, I 
thought at first. But 
when he moved closer to the light 
by # the cash register to ask the 
bartender for a match or something, I saw it wasn't that. Not 
just the nose. Broken veins on his 
cheeks, too, and the funny eyes. 



He must have seen me look, because he slid back away from the 
light. 

The bartender shook my bottle 
of ale in front of me like a Swiss 
bell-ringer so it foamed inside the 
green glass. 

"You ready for another, sir?" 
he asked. 



Illustrated by ASHMAN 



THE ALTAR AT MIDNIGHT 



95 



I shook my head. Down the 
bar, he tried it on the kid — he was 
drinking scotch and water or 
something like that — and found 
out he could push him around. 
He sold him three scotch and 
waters in ten minutes. 

When he tried for number four, 
the kid had his courage up and 
said, "I'll tell you when I'm ready 
for another, Jack." But there 
wasn't any trouble. 

It was almost nine and the 
place began to fill up. The manager, a real hood type, stationed 
himself by the door to screen out 
the high-school kids and give the 
big hello to conventioneers. The 
girls came hurrying in, too, with 
their little makeup cases and their 
fancy hair piled up and their 
* frozen faces with the perfect 
mouths drawn on them. One of 
them stopped to say -something to 
the manager, some excuse about 
something, and he said: "That's 
aw ri'; get inna dressing room." 

A three piece band behind the 
drapes at the back of the stage 
began to make warmup noises 
and there were two bartenders 
keeping busy. Mostly it was beer 
— a midweek crowd. I finished my 
ale and had to wait a couple of 
minutes before I could get another bottle. The bar filled up 
from the end near the stage because all the customers wanted 
a good, close look at the strippers 
for their fifty-cent bottles of beer. 



But I noticed that nobody sat 
down next to the kid, or. if anybody did, he didn't stay long — 
you go out for some fun and the 
bartender pushes you around and 
nobody wants to sit next to you. 
I picked up my bottle and glass 
and went down on the stool to 
his left. 

He turned to me right away 
and said: "What kind of a place 
is this, anyway?" The broken 
veins were all over his face, little 
ones, but so many, so close, that 
they made his face look something like marbled rubber. The 
funny look in his eyes was it — the 
trick contact lenses. But I tried 
not to stare and not to look 
away. 

"It's okay," I said. "It's a good 
show if you don't mind a lot of 
noise from — " 

He stuck a cigarette into his 
mouth and poked the pack at me. 
"I'm a spacer," he said, interrupting. 

I took one of his cigarettes and 
said: "Oh." 

He snapped a lighter for the 
cigarettes and said: "Venus." 

1" WAS noticing that his pack of 
cigarettes on the bar had some 
kind of yellow sticker instead of 
the blue tax stamp. 

"Ain't that a crock?" he asked. 
"You can't smoke and they give 
you lighters for a souvenir. But 
it's a good lighter. On Mars last

week, they gave us all some cheap 
pen -and -pencil sets." 

"You get something every trip, 
hah?" I took a good, long drink 
of ale and he finished his scotch 
and water. 

"Shoot. You call a trip a 
'shoot'." 

One of the girls was working 
her way down the bar. She was 
going to slide onto the empty 
stool at his right and give him 
the business, but she looked at 
him first and decided not to. She 
curled around me and asked if 
I'd buy her a H'l ole drink. I said 
no and she moved on to the next. 
I could kind of feel the young 
fellow quivering. When I looked 
at him, he stood up. I followed 
him out of the dump. The manager grinned without thinking and 
said, "G'night, boys," to us. 

The kid stopped in the street 
and said to me: "You don't have 
to follow me around, Pappy." He 
sounded like one wrong word and 
I would get socked in the teeth. 

"Take it easy. I know a place 
where they won't spit in your 
eye." 

He pulled himself together and 
made a joke of it. "This I have 
to see," he said. "Near here?" 

"A few blocks." 

We started walking. It was a 
nice night. 

"I don't know this city at all," 
he said . "I'm from Co vi ngtpn , 
Kentucky. You do your drinking 



at home there. We don't have 
places like this." He meant the 
whole Skid Row area. 

"It's not so bad," I said. "I 
spend a lot of time here." 

"Is that a fact? I mean, down 
home a man your age would likely have a wife and children." 

"I do. The hell with them." 

He laughed like a real youngster and I figured he couldn't 
even be twenty-five. He didn't 
have any trouble with the broken 
curbstones in spite of his scotch 
and waters. I asked him about it. 

"Sense of balance," he said. 
"You have to be tops for balance 
to be a spacer — you spend so 
much time outside in a suit. 
People don't know how much. 
Punctures. And you aren't worth 
a damn if you lose your point." 

"What's that mean?" 

"Oh. Well, it's hard to describe. 
When you're outside and you lose 
your point, it means you're all 
mixed up, you don't know which 
way the can — that's the ship — 
which way the can is. It's having 
all that room around you. But if 
you have a good balance, you feel 
a little tugging to the ship, or 
maybe you just know which way 
the ship is without feeling it. 
Then you have your point and 
you can get the work done." 

"There must be a lot that's 
hard to describe." 

He thought that might be a 
crack and he clammed- up on me. 



THE ALTAR AT MIDNIGHT 



97 



"You call this Gandytown," I 
said after a while. "It's where 
the stove-up old railroad men 
hang out. This is the place." 

IT was the second week of the 

month, before everybody's 
pension check was all gone. Oswiak's was jumping. The Grandsons of the Pioneers were on the 
juke singing the Man from Mars 
Yodel and old Paddy Shea was 
jigging in the middle of the floor. 
He had a full seidel of beer in his 
right hand and his empty left 
sleeve was flapping. 

The kid balked at the screen 
door. "Too damn bright," he said. 

I shrugged and went on in and 
he followed. We sat down at a 
table. At Oswiak's you can drink 
aT the bar if you want to, but 
none of the regulars do. 

Paddy jigged over and said: 
"Welcome home. Doc." He's a 
Liverpool Irishman; they talk 
like Scots, some say, but they 
sound almost like Brooklyn to 
me. 

"Hello, Paddy. I brought somebody uglier than you. Now what 
do you say?" 

Paddy jigged around the kid 
in a half-circle with his sleeve 
flapping and then flopped into a 
chair when the record stopped. 
He took a big drink from the seidel and said: "Can he do this?" 
Paddy stretched his face into an 
awful grin that showed his teeth. 



He has three of them. The kid 
laughed and asked me : "What 
the hell did you drag me into 
here for?" 

"Paddy says he'll buy drinks 
for the house the day anybody 
uglier than he is comes in." 

Oswiak's wife waddled over for 
the order and the kid asked us 
what we'd have. I figured I could 
start drinking, so it was three 
double scotches. 

After the second round, Paddy 
started blowing about how they 
took his arm off without any 
anesthetics except a bottle of gin 
because the red-ball freight he 
was tangled up in couldn't wait. 

That brought some of the other 
old gimps over to the table with 
their stories. 

Blackie Bauer had been sitting 
in a boxcar with his legs sticking 
through the door when the train 
started with a jerk. Wham, the 
door closed. Everybody laughed 
at Blackie for being that dumb 
in the first place, and he got mad. 

Sam Fireman has palsy. This 
week he was claiming he used to 
be a watchmaker before he began 
to shake. The week before, he'd 
said he was a brain surgeon. A 
woman I didn't know, a real old 
Boxcar Bertha , dragged herself 
over and began some kind of 
story about how her sister married a Greek, but she passed out 
before we found out what happened. 



98 




 



Somebody wanted to know 
what was wrong with the kid's 
face — Bauer, I think it was, after 
he came back to the table. 

"Compression and decompression," the kid said. "You're all 
the time climbing into your suit 
and out of your suit. Inboard 
air's thin to start with. You get 
a few redlines — that's these ruptured blood vessels— and you say 
the hell with the money; all you'll 
make is just one more trip. But, 
God, it's a lot of money for anybody my age! You keep saying 
that until you can't be anything 
but a spacer. The eyes are hardradiation scars." 

"You like dot all ofer?" asked 
Oswiak's wife politely. 

"All over, ma'am," the kid told 
her in a miserable voice. "But 
I'm going to quit before I get a 
Bowman Head." 

"I don't care," said Maggie 
Rorty. "I think he's cute." 

"Compared with — " Paddy began, but I kicked him under the 
table. 

WE sang for a while, and then 
we told gags and recited 
limericks for a while, and I noticed that the kid and Maggie had 
wandered into the back room — 
the one with the latch on the 
door. 

Oswiak's wife asked me, very 
puzzled: "Doc, w'y dey do dot 
flyink by planyets?" 



"It's the damn govermint," 
Sam Fireman said. 

"Why not?" I said. "They got 
the Bowman Drive, why the hell 
shouldn't they use it? Serves 'em 
right." I had a double scotch and 
added: "Twenty years of it and 
the found out a few things they 
didn't know. Redlines are only 
one of them. Twenty years more, 
maybe they'll find out a few 
more things they didn't know. 
Maybe by the time there's a 
bathtub in every American home 
and an alcoholism clinic in every 
American town, they'll find out 
a whole lot of things they didn't 
know. And every American boy 
will be a pop-eyed, blood -raddled 
wreck, like our friend here, from 
riding the Bowman Drive." 

"It's the damn govermint," 
Sam Fireman repeated. 

"And what the hell did you 
mean by that remark about alcoholism?" Paddy said, real sore. 
"Personally, I can take it or leave 
it alone." 

So we got to talking about that 
and everybody there turned out 
to be people who could take it or 
leave it alone. 

TT was maybe midnight when 
the kid showed at the table 
again, looking kind of dazed. I 
was drunker than I ought to be 
by midnight, so I said I was going for a walk. He tagged along 
and we wound up on a bench at 



THE ALTAR AT MIDNIGHT 



99 



Screwball Square. The soap-boxers were still going strong. Like I 
said, it was a nice night. After 
a while, a pot-bellied old auntie 
who didn't give a damn about 
the face sat down and tried to 
talk the kid. into going to see 
some etchings. The kid didn't get 
it and I led him over to hear the 
soap-boxers before there was 
trouble. 

One of the orators was a mushmouthed evangelist. "And oh, my 
friends," he said, "when I looked 
through the porthole of the spaceship and beheld the wonder of 
the Firmament — " 

"You're a stinkin' Yankee liar!" 
the kid yelled at him. "You say 
one damn more word about canshootin' and I'll ram your spaceship down your lyin' throat! 
Wheah's your redlines if you're 
such a hot spacer?" 

The crowd didn't know what he 
was talking about, but "wheah's 
your redlines" sounded good to 
them, so they heckled mushmouth off his box with it. 

I got the kid to a bench. The 
liquor was working in him all of 
a sudden. He simmered down 
after a while and asked: "Doc, 
should I've given Miz Rorty some 
money? I asked her afterward 
and she said she'd admire to have 
something to remember me by, 
so I gave her my lighter. She 
seem' to be real pleased with it. 
But I was wondering if maybe I 



embarrassed her by asking her 
right out. Like I tol' you, back 
in Covington, Kentucky, we don't 
have places like that. Or maybe 
we did and I just didn't know 
about them. But what do you 
think I should've done about 
Miz Rorty?" 

"Just what you did," I told 
him. "If they want money, they 
ask you for it first. Where you 
staying?" 

"Y. M. C. A.," he said, almost 
asleep. "Back in Covington, Kentucky, I was a member of the Y 
and I kept up my membership. 
They have to let me in because 
I'm "a member. Spacers have all 
kinds of trouble, Doc. Woman 
trouble. Hotel trouble. Fam'ly 
trouble. Religious trouble. I was 
raised a Southern Baptist, but 
wheah's Heaven, anyway? I ask* 
Doctor Chitwood las' time home 
before the redlines got so thick — 
Doc, you aren't a minister of the 
Gospel, are you? I hope I di'n' 
say anything to offend you." 

"No offense, son," I said. "No 
offense." 

I walked him to the avenue and 
waited for a fleet cab. It was almost five minutes. The independents that roll drunks dent the 
fenders of fleet cabs if they show 
up in Skid Row and then the 
fleet drivers have to make reports 
on their own time to the company. It keeps them away. But I 
got one and dumped the kid in. 



100 




 



"The Y Hotel," I told the driver. "Here's five. Help him in when 
you get there." 

WHEN I walked through 
Screwball Square again, 
some college kids were yelling 
"wheah's your redlines" at old 
Charlie, the last of the Wobblies. 

Old Charlie kept roaring: "The 
hell with your breadlines! I'm 
talking about atomic bombs. 
Right — up — there!" And he pointed at the Moon. 

It was a nice night, but the 
liquor was dying in me. 

There was a joint around the 
corner, so I went in and had a 
drink to carry me to the club; I 
had a bottle there. I got into the 
first cab that came. 
"Athletic Club," I said. 
"Inna dawghouse, harh?" the 
driver said, and he gave me a big 
personality smile. 

I didn't say anything and he 
started the car. 



He was right, of course. I was 
in everybody's doghouse. Some 
day I'd scare hell out of Tom 
and Lise by going home and 
showing them what their daddy 
looked like. 

Down at the Institute, I was in 
the doghouse. 

"Oh, dear," everybody at the 
Institute said to everybody, "I'm 
sure I don't know what ails the 
man. A lovely wife and two lovely grown children and she had to 
tell him 'either you go or I go.'* 
And drinking! And this is rather 
subtle, but it's a well-known fact 
that neurotics seek out low company to compensate for their 
guilt-feelings. The places he frequents. Doctor Francis Bowman, 
the man who made space-flight a 
reality. The man who put the 
Bomb Base on the Moon! Really, 
I'm sure I don't know what ails 
him." 

The hell with them all.

what better, and the one after 
that, in 1956, will be almost the 
minimum possible, which is 35 
million miles. 

As you can easily guess from 
the first sentence, I make sure 
that I have a look at Mars on 
those occasions. And since I 
know what to expect, I was disappointed only the first time, 
quite a number of years ago. 

The man who goes to an astronomical observatory on visitor's night usually has read a few 
books on astronomical subjects 
and has seen some pictures. Now 
he is going to check the pictures 
with reality and in general he 
sees what he expects to see. There 
is bright- glowing Venus, showing 
phases like the Moon's. There 
are the mountains and craters 
and dark maria of the Moon, just 
as described in the books. There 
is Saturn with its rings, incredible 
but sharp and clear in the dark 
sky. And there is Jupiter with its 
stripes and several of its large 
moons almost militarily lined up. 
But when it comes to Mars, the 
visitor is almost always disappointed. He expected to see — 
well, reddish deserts and graygreen areas of vegetation. He 
was hoping for one of the famous 
"oases," preferably Lacus so/is, 
and maybe a canal or two. 

What he actually sees, even 
with a hundred magnifications, is 
something slightly smaller than 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



the Moon appears to the naked 
eye. Mars looks like a brightly 
illuminated orange about a block 
away. When there is a polar cap, 
you can make it out quite easily. 
And if you are lucky, you can 
also see the main marking, the 
dark triangle of Syrris ma jor. 
After having a look at Mars 
yourself, at close approach and 
with a fairly large instrument, 
you no longer wonder why astronomers cannot answer so 
many of the layman's questions. 
On the contrary, the wonder is 
how they managed to learn as 
much as they have. 

LET'S run quickly through the. 
facts agreed upon by everybody. The dark areas called 
"seas" are not seas, but sections 
covered with vegetation which 
shows very pronounced seasonal 
changes in coloring. Most astronomers say that this vegetation probably corresponds to terrestrial lichens, but this statement 
mostly means that terrestrial 
lichens could probably survive on 
Mars. What shape the Martian 
plants took via a hundred million 
years of local evolution is something we'll have to see in order 
to be certain. 

Another point on which there 
is general agreement now is the 
nature of the polar caps. They 
are true ice (not "dry ice" as 
was suspected by a few for some 

103 



time) and very thin, probably 
just a few inches on the average. 
It is also agreed that the canals 
do exist, although nobody knows 
what" they are. Dr. Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto, 
advanced the guess that the socalled "oases" are large impact 
craters, caused by arrivals from 
the Asteroid Belt, and that the 
"canals" are cracks formed by 
those impacts. 

As for the deserts, Prof. Henry 
Norris Russell suggested a number of years ago that they are red 
because they are iron oxides, 
which would also explain the lack 
of oxygen in the Martian atmosphere. Dr. Tombaugh did 
not agree with this view and 
thought that the sands of the 
Martin deserts were red because 
they had been pulverized from 
normally red rocks. But most 
recent observations by French astronomers agree with Prof. Russell — the Martian deserts polarize 
light in the same manner as limonite. Limonite is the name of a 
terrestrial iron ore, chemically almost the same as rust. 

As regards the atmosphere of 
Mars, some conclusions were 
published recently by Gerard de 
Vaucouleurs, who is at present 
working in Australia. Nobody 
can say that de Vaucouleurs is 
very optimistic about Mars, 
which he calls: "A desert, moved 
to the arctic and lifted to strato


spheric heights." The composition of , that thin atmosphere, 
according to de Vaucouleurs, is 
98.5 per cent nitrogen and about 
1.3 per cent argon, which leaves 
only very little room for oxygen 
and other- gases. 

That this should be the last 
word on the Martian atmosphere 
is at least doubtful. It certainly 
cannot be the composition near 
the ground. 

In the first place, the areas 
now generally accepted as vegetation must produce some oxygen. I have to mention at this 
point that It is assumed that the 
Martian vegetation does not require liquid water, but can 
utilize water vapor in the atmosphere. This assumption is 
quite reasonable, for some terrestrial plants can do it, too. A 
few years ago, the Russian astronomer Tikhov reported the 
discovery of a tree with that 
characteristic from the highlands 
of Inner Asia; in fact, Tikhov 
referred to it as Marsianka 
("little Martian"). Quite recently it was discovered that we 
have a similar tree on the West 
Coast. 

But if we assume occasional 
water vapor in the Martian atmosphere (for the sake of the 
plants), then something discovered in our own atmosphere must 
also take place on Mars. Dr. 
Joseph Kaplan has offered the 



104 




 



theory that solar radiation takes 
water vapor apart, splitting it 
into oxygen and hydrogen. The 
hydrogen escapes, but the oxygen 
remains in the form of separate 
atoms, as long as the Sun is 
shining. After sunset, the atoms 
of oxygen combine into oxygen 
molecules with some release of 
energy, which accounts for the 
sky glow. In our atmosphere, 
this takes place at a considerable 
height, around 60 miles. In the 
Martian atmosphere, the same 
process should take place nearer 
the ground. 

Well, we'll indubitably find out 
one day, but not by making our 
observations from Earth. 

THE BUMBLEBEE BUGLER 

THE bumblebee, Bombus rerresrris — everything that follows is also true of the related 
Bombus ruderatus — builds its 
nest on and often even in the 
ground. Neither the architectural 
arrangement nor the workmanship compares with that of the 
honeybee, but the general idea is 
the same. Nor are there as many 
inhabitants in a bumblebee nest; 
the maximum number seems to 
be about 450. 

But in spite of lesser numbers 
and poorer housing, the bumblebee seemed to be able to boast 
something that the honeybee did 
not have. An otherwise long for


gotten naturalist by the name of 
Goedard told the story for the 
first time in 1685. 

Old Goedard, who either suffered from insomnia or had the 
reprehensible habit of getting up 
at 3 a.m., reported that he came 
across a bumblebee nest at that 
early hour, when the sky was 
already bright, but all of Nature 
that he could see was still asleep, 
including the bumblebees. 

As he watched, an especially 
fat bumblebee climbed out of 
the nest. It took its position near 
the hole from which it had 
emerged and began to beat its 
wings. But to Goedard's surprise, instead of taking off, it just 
sat there, humming loud and 
furiously. This went on for ten 
minutes, fifteen minutes. Other 
bumblebees crawled sleepily out 
of the nest and reluctantly began 
the day's work. But the first one 
kept humming for another fifteen 
minutes until the whole family 
was awake. Then it disappeared. 

The bumblebees, Goedard announced, have a bugler like a 
military garrison — an individual 
with the duty of waking up the 
others so that they will not oversleep and waste some of the new 
day the Lord hath made. 

Others read this and accepted 
it as one more example of the 
miraculous Organization of tiny 
insects. A little later some authors became cautious about it 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



105 



and, still later, the story was repeated with an amused and 
somewhat superior smile, as a 
typical fairy tale from the early 
days of natural history. 

But then, almost 200 years 
after Goedard, came Professor 
Hoffer of Graz in Austria and 
said : "Yes, its true, the bumblebees do have a bugler." He had 
seen it himself because in his 
garden there was a nest of Bombus ruder atus. 

The day of the year when he 
noticed it first was the 7th of 
July. The bugler began making 
noise at 3:30 a.m. and kept it up 
until about 4:15 a.m. This went 
on every day — Prof. Hoffer called 
the members of his family, colleagues and even the local policeman as witnesses — until the 25th 
8f July. On that day Hoffer 
caught the bugler to see whether 
it differed in any way from any 
of the others. Next day a new 
bugler was on duty. 

For almost half a century, the 
bumblebee bugler was back in 
good graces (and in natural history textbooks) until Dr. von 
Buttel - Reepen re-opened the 
case. He did not say that it 
wasn't so. The facts were clear 
and, moreover, von Buttel Reepen had observed it himself 
many a time. What he doubted 
was the explanation, in spite of 
all analogies with alarm clocks, 
military procedure and crowing 




The bumblebee nest, he said, is 
in the ground, or close to it. It is 
moist. The insects themselves 
have collected their version of 
honey which thickens by evaporating surplus water. In short, 
the air must be awful in the 
morning and even if bumblebees 
don't mind bad smells, the moisture content must be too high for 
their purposes. 

Now the same thing happens 
in bee hives where much larger 
quantities of honey are thickening. The bees have found out 
that they can do something about 
it: They form long chains from 
the entrance to the honeycombs^ 
and sit there, fanning the air with 
their wings, getting. the moisture 
out of their hive. Since the bumblebee colony is so much smaller, 
a single individual can do it. 

Simple tests showed that the 
solitary bugler actually causes a 
ventilating wind. The new inter 


106 




 



pretation was accepted by other 
entomologists without delay. It 
had been one of those cases where 
the by-product is mistaken for 
the purpose. Some electric fans 
make a lot of noise, but only 
incidentally. 

HOT WATER ICE CUBES 

MY casual mention about the 
latent heat of water and the 
inadvisability of overworking 
your refrigerator with hot water 
in the trays has caused some 
"hot" mail plus a heated phone 
conversation. Mrs. Carr of the 
National Fantasy Fan Federation 
in Seattle, Washington, wrote 
some harsh words: "An excellent 
example of a certain type of socalled 'scientific' thinking which 
brands as 'superstition* any fact 
it cannot explain in its own 
pompous and shortsighted terms." 

Now let's all calm down and 
review what I said. I did not 
claim that I had made the experiment, or even checked it. I 
stated that somebody in 1 the 
Bureau of Standards had done 
so and told me about it. I also 
said that cold water has less heat 
for the refrigerator to carry 
away. Well, it has! As for the 
discussion itself, I'll quote from 
a letter by Mr. Paul D. Hobson 
of 220 Research Road in Ottawa. 
Ontario, Canada. He wrote me: 
"Some time ago I was asked 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



the same question and carried out 
experiments. I found that a dry 
clean ice tray on a dry clean 
shelf gave the expected result, as 
found by the Bureau of Standards. If, however, the shelf was 
covered with a layer of frost, as is 
usually the case with a domestic 
refrigerator, a tray containing 
initially warm water would freeze 
appreciably more quickly than a 
tray of cold water. The reason 
seems to be that the warm tray 
melts the frost and settles into 
contact with the metal of the 
freezer shelf before the moisture 
freezes up again, so that there is 
an improved conductive heat 
flow between the tray and the 
freezer unit. 

"If the freezer is badly in need 
of defrosting, the saving in time 
can be as much as five minutes. 
Further experiments have shown 
that even faster freezing can be 
obtained by using cold water in 
a clean tray and freezer shelf, 
free of all frost, and wetting the 
outside of the freezer tray so that 
it is 'glued' to the shelf by a thin 
film of ice. This last result is 
confirmed by statements in some 
refrigerator manufacturers' handbooks." 

And that, I hope, is that. You 
can't expect the Bureau of Standards, or anybody else, to enter 
poor maintenance as a factor in 

its research.

ANY QUESTIONS? 

/ have heard of a device that 
is supposed to reproduce longdead sound vibrations from the 
atmosphere. It is said to work 
on the principle that sound never 
dies, but continues to agitate the 
air molecules, 

Willard C, Reed, 
R.F.D. No. 4 
Camden, Tenn. 
The inventor of this device 
was an author in a story in 
which the Sermon on the 
Mount was reproduced, leading 
not to clarication, hut to endless 
discussions about the precise 
meaning of this or thai Aramaic 
word. Actually, such a device 
is impossible because sound 
Hoes die and very quickly too. 

Supposing you yell, "boom!" 
This means that you expend a 
certain amount of energy causing spherical waves traveling 
outward from your mouth and 
expanding. As they expand, 
their surfaces increase rapidly, 
but there is only the original 
energy you put in. Therefore a 
given amount of energy is 
spread over a larger and larger 
surface. After a very short 
time, the energy per air molecule in that expanding sphere 
becomes less than that of the 
random motion of the air 
molecules. 

At that instant, the sound is 



dead and its reassembly is as 
impossible as the reassembly of 
the ashes of a cremated body 
sprinkled over the ocean twenty 
years ago. 

Explain the words positron and 
proton and give the difference, if 
any. 

Dick Clarkson,

Both are particles composing 
atoms. As you know, there are 
essentially two kinds of subatomic particles, light ones and 
heavy ones, the heavy ones having about 1840 times the mass 
of the light ones. The heavy 
ones are the proton (which 
carries a positive electric 
charge) and the neutron (about 
the same mass as the proton, 
hut without electric charge )\ A 
third heavy one, the negatron 
(same mass as the proton, 
though carrying a negative electric charge) is assumed by 
some, but so far has not been 
discovered. The light ones are 
the electron (with one negative 
charge), the positron (with one 
positive charge) and the neutrino, assumed to have the same 
mass as the electron, but no 
charge. 

The neutrino is, by definition undetectable and has, 
therefore, not been actually detected; it has been found 



108 




 



necessary to assume its existence to balance equations. 

In between the light and the 
heavy sub-atomic particles, 
there is a whole slew of mesons 
of different weights (up to 800 
electron masses) and exceedingly short lifetimes. One explanation of the mesons is that 
they are temporary swirls of a 
bunch of electrons; in ten years 
or so, we may know more about 
them. 

Since the nucleus of the 
normal hydrogen atom is a 
single proton, protons are often 
referred to as "hydrogen 
nuclei." Heavy hydrogen has 
a nucleus composed of one proton and one neutron, the nucleus as a whole being called a 
deuteron. 

The nucleus of the very rare 
form of hydrogen which consists of one proton and two 
neutrons is called a triton, since 
that isotope of hydrogen is 
called tritium. The nucleus of 
helium of mass 3 (same mass 
as a triton) consists of two protons and one neutron and, since 
the He-3 isotope is called tralphium, is a ti alpha particle. 
The reason why this form was 
chosen— one could have called 
it "tralphon" — is that the nucleus of the abundant helium 
isotope He-4, consisting of two 
protons and two neutrons, has 
been known for many years 



under the name of "alpha 
particle." 

If I stopped here, I would 
get letters asking why an alpha 
particle is called an alpha 
particle, so I might as well add 
that now. The most frequent 
phenomenon in natural radioactivity is the release of a 
helium nucleus, accompanied 
by radiation. In order to give 
a graphic example of what happens, one of the early researchers (I believe it was the late 
Lord Rutherford of Nelson) 
compared it with the firing of a 
gun. Most important is the 
heavy projectile, the alpha 
particle. Then there is some 
smoke, tenuous but still material, the beta radiation (electrons), and then there is the 
flash, not material, the gamma 
radiation. 

There are two theories regarding the red shift of extragalactic 
nebulae: one being that the red 
end of the spectrum is displaced 
because of the Galaxy's radial 
velocity, and the other that the 
light has actually become tired 
on its journey through space. In 
your opinion, which one of these 
two theories is more logical and 
why? 

Gary Motley, 
24 Crane Avenue,

Before I state my pergonal 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



109 



opinion, it might be useful to 
explain what this question is 
about to those not too conversant with the term "red 
shift." 

Everybody knows that visible 
light conies in an assortment of 
wave-lengths. Violet rays have 
the shortest wave-length that 
still makes an impression on 
our eyes. Then comes blue, 
then green and, through yellow 
and orange, we arrive at red, 
which baa the longest wavelength that we can still see. 

In that spectrum, from violet 
lo red, there are lines which 
can be used as reference points. 
If they appear shifted toward 
the red end of the spectrum, it 
means that the body which 
emits the light is moving away 
from us. If the body were moving toward us, the lines would 
be displaced in the direction of 
the violet end. 

There are thousands of "extragalactic nebulae" (other 
galaxies) that we can see, and 
they all display a pronounced 
red shift. When the amount of 
red shift was measured, it 
turned out that it was larger as 
the separating distance grew 
longer. In other words, the ones 
which are farthest away are also 
running from us most rapidly. 
The ones nearer us are also 
running away, but not so fast. 

The whole picture is what 



would result if the Universe as 
a whole were expanding and it 
has, indeed, led to that concept. 

But if we make the assumption that light waves, after 
traveling thousands of years, 
gradually "tire" and "stretch," 
a red shift would be the result, 
too, and it would also be proportional to the distance. 

Now, some of the other galaxies which are quite near, as 
galactic distance go, show movements other than recession 
from us. Some are even approaching. This is explained 
by Camow and others as a random motion which, for these 
objects, happens to lie directed 
against the motion that would 
result from universal expansion. But you may also say that 
these galaxies are close enough 
lo permit us to measure their 
true movements, since their 
light has not traveled long 
enough to become "lired." 

Nobody can say at this point 
which explanation is true. But 
I was brought up on the advice 
that, if you have two alternate 
explanations for the same set 
of observed facts, the simpler 
one is likely to be correct. Personally, I find it far easier to 
believe that light waves are not 
indestructible and that the red 
shift is the result of distance 
traveled rather than of movements proportional to distance.

A woman who sees no humor 
in this story is— hm, would she 
be likely to read it at ail? 



HARRY is a wit. Someone 
has defined a wit as a 
person who can tell a funny story without cracking a smile. 
That's Harry. 

"You know," Steve said at the 
office one day, "I'll bet Harry will 
walk right up to the flaming gates 
of Hell, keeping the Devil in 



stitches all the time, and never 
change expression." 

That's the kind of fellow Harry 
is. A great guy to have around 
the office. Makes you laugh just 
to see him, thinking about the 
last story he told. Smart, too. 
Keeps at a thing, digging away, 
piling up facts and stuff until 



Illustrated by KARL ROGERS 

THE MISOGYNIST 



you finally see something straight 
for the first time. Everybody says 
he's going places. 

But the kind of story Harry 
likes — he likes them long. They 
start kind of slow, you know, 
and sort of build up with a tickle 
here and a tickle there until each 
new touch makes you helpless, 
you're so weak with laughter. The 
kind of story you take home to 
your wife and you get part way 
through, laughing like a fool, and 
you notice she's just sitting there, 
sort of patient and martyred, 
thinking maybe about tomorrow's 
dinner or the dress sale downtown, and you stop laughing and 
sigh and say, "It must be the 
way he tells it" or "Nobody can 
tell stories like Harry." 

But then women don't think 
Harry's funny. 

Take the other night, for instance. Harry and I were sitting 
in his living room while the women — Lucille and Jane — were out 
in the kitchen, whipping up something after the last rubber, and 
Harry started this story. Only at 
first I didn't know it was a story. 

"Did you ever stop to think," 
Harry said, "about what strange 
creatures women really are? The 
way they change, I mean, after 
you marry them. You know, they 
stop hanging on your words, they 
stop catering to your likes and 
dislikes, they stop laughing at 
your jokes." 



I have a minor reputation as 
a humorist myself — oh, nothing 
in Harry's class, but ready with 
quip or pun, if you know what 
I mean. I came in with a laugh 
and said, "So the honeymoon is 
over," Harry and Lucille being 
married only a month or so. 

"Yes," said Harry seriously. 
"Yes, I guess you could say that. 
The honeymoon is over." 

"Tough," I said, feeling sorry 
for the guy. "The girl you marry 
and the woman you're married 
to are two different people." 

"Oh, no," Harry disagreed, 
shaking his head. "They're not. 
That's just the point." 

"The point?" I asked, getting 
an inkling that Harry's thoughtful face hid a purpose not entirely serious. "You mean there 
is a point?" 

"Of course. It's not just a matter of superficial differences, you 
see. It's something fundamental. 
Women think differently, their 
methods are different, their goals 
are different. So different, in fact, 
that they are entirely incomprehensible." 

"I gave up trying to understand 
them a long time ago." 

"That's where we make our 
mistake," Harry said soberly. 
"We accept when we should try 
to understand. We must understand why. As the Scotch say, 
'All are good lasses, but where 
come the ill wives?' " 



112 




 



"Why?" I wanted to know, a 
little puzzled. "They're built differently, and not just outside. 
Glands, bearing children — all 
kinds of differences." 

"That's their excuse," said 
Harry, sneering, "and it's not 
good enough. They should do best 
what their differences best fit 
them for. But their greatest career is marriage — and their greatest failure. A man to them is only 
the necessary evil they must have 
before they can get the other 
things they want." 

"Like the black widow spider 
and her mate?" I suggested. 

"In a way. And yet not entirely. The spiders, at least, are 
of the same species." 

I nodded over that for a moment before it soaked in. "And 
men and women aren't?" I practically yelled. 

"Sh!" he warned, and glanced 
nervously at the kitchen door. 

*T^HEN was when I began to 
chuckle. Harry should have 
been in the movies. And yet I 
had to admire the guy, making 
a joke out of what is — every husband can tell you — one of the 
greatest and most secret tragedies 
of life, greater even because no 
one can talk about it. No one but 
Harry. 

My chuckle must have been the 
right response, because he nodded, relaxed, and stopped glanc


ing at the door out of the corner 
of his eye. Or maybe that was 
after Lucille peeked around the 
corner and said, "Harry off on 
one of his stories again? Tell us 
when he's through, so we can 
bring in the refreshments." 

She was pretty light about it 
and you could tell it was a running joke and I couldn't help 
thinking what a lucky guy Harry 
was — if a fellow has to get married, that is, and most of us do. 

"The alien race," Harry whispered and leaned back. 

It was a good line and I laughed; there wasn't anything forced 
about it, either. 

"What better way," he continued, "to conquer a race than 
to breed it out of existence? The 
Chinese learned that a long time 
ago. Conqueror after conqueror 
took the country and each one 
was passively accepted, allowed 
to intermarry . . . and eventually 
was absorbed. Only this case is 
the reverse. Conquest by marriage 
might be a good term for it. Breed 
in the conqueror, breed out the 
slave. Breed in the alien, breed 
out the human." 

I nodded appreciatively. 
"Makes sense." 

"How did it all start?" asked 
Harry. "And when? If I knew 
those answers, I'd know the whole 
thing. All I've got is a theory. 
An alien race of women landed 
on Earth — when man was still a

cave-dwelling animal, maybe, or 
it could even have been in historic times — and my guess is they 
were dropped here by their men. 
Jettisoned. Dumped. Why? To 
get rid of them, obviously." 

"But what did their men do 
then?" I had to ask, feeding him 
the next point. 

"How do I know?" he replied 
irritably. "They were aliens, remember. Maybe they had some 
solution, some procreative substitute for women. Maybe these 
women were just the worst of 
the lot and the remaining ones 
were better. Maybe the men 
didn't give a damn and preferred 
racial suicide to surrender." 

He angrily shoved the coffee 
table aside, grumbling something 
abouj: women's ideas of furnishing a home, and pulled his chair 
closer. "Sure, surrender. They 
couldn't exterminate the men, 
could they? Who has the weapons, the military knowledge? 
Besides, women don't think like 
that. Their minds work in devious ways; they win what they 
want by guile and subtlety. 
That's why they married into 
the human race." 

I looked blank, which is always a good way to push him on. 

"Well, look," he said earnestly, 
just as I figured he would, "how 
about the Amazons? Once a year, 
you know, they visited the Gargareans, a neighboring tribe; any 



resulting male children were put 
to death. That didn't work very 
long, of course. Their purpose 
and their very alienness were too 
obvious. And the matriarchies — 
too blatant, you see, might give 
the whole thing away. Besides, 
men are useful in ways that women aren't. Men are inventive, 
artistic, creative — and can be 
nagged or coaxed into doing what 
women want them to do." 

1LIT a cigarette and looked for 
an ashtray to put the match. 
He shoved over some silly little 
object that would suffocate a 
cigarette the minute you laid it 
down. No grooves, either, of 
course. 

"That's what women buy when 
they're on their own," he pointed 
out disgustedly. "Lights that they 
think look pretty and make you 
blind or put a crick in your back 
when you try to read. You get 
a house with a southern exposure 
so you'll have sunlight, ■a'nd then 
they put up heavy drapes to keep 
the furniture from fading. That's 
not enough, so they dress the furniture in slipcovers that always 
get twisted and creased. They

thing into drawers where you 
never can find what you want." 

I dug an uncomfortable cushion out from behind me and 
threw it on another chair. "All 
of them?" I asked. "Are they 
all alike?" 

"I've wondered about that," he 
admitted, frowning. "There must 
be some human women left. One 
hears about happy marriages, although that might just be female 
propaganda. The women who like 
to read and use their minds, I'd 
say. Those who aren't so damned 
practical that they'd get up off 
their deathbeds to straighten a 
crooked picture. Women who can 
grasp abstract ideas. I don't think 
the — the aliens can." He looked 
up, brightening. "Those could be 
tests for alienness. That .is," he 
added, frowning again, "if I'm 
right and there actually are any 
human women." 

"How about those," I chipped 
in, "who prefer men and dislike 
other women?" 

He thought that over seriously. 
"Most other women. It could be 
that they sense the aliens better 
than we can and don't want anything to do with them. Yes, that 
would — no, the aliens probably 
stick together, so that's out as 
a test." 

"There are women who are satisfied with just a comfortable 
life," I suggested. "Those who 
don't drive their husbands to so 



much insurance that they're 
worth more dead than alive and 
then work them to death. That 
sounds pretty human to me." 

Harry shrugged helplessly. "I 
guess so, but we'll never really 
know the answers. Or, if we do, 
it'll be too late." 

"Too late?" 

"Well, certainly," he said, tapping me on the knee. That's my 
ticklish spot and I was having 
enough trouble not laughing. "It's 
only in the last few generations 
that their plans have been coming 
closer to success. They have the 
vote, equal rights without giving 
up any of their privileges, and 
so forth. They're outliving men— 
and it's men, of course, who are 
extending the life span for them. 
They control about ninety per 
cent of the wealth. And there's 
something else men are doing for 
them." His voice sank to a significant whisper. "We're experimenting with fertilization by salt 
water, electrical stimulus, that 
sort of thing. Once we work it out 
properly ..." 

"We won't be needed any 
more," I spluttered. 

"That's right," he agreed gravely. "They'll just refuse to marry, 
use prenatal sex determination 
to produce nothing but girls, and 
then you'll have a single race — 
the female race. That's what I 
think they want." 

"It figures," I answered, trying 



THE MISOGYNIST 



115 



to crush out my cigarette in the 
ridiculous tray. 

He nodded. "Don't think I 
haven't got more than vague suspicions. And it's been damned 
hard; knowledge of the female 
conspiracy has died out in the 
last fifty years or so. There's no 
longer even that subconscious 
knowledge that alerted the centuries of men before — that body 
of tradition and folklore which 
- is a sort of inherited wisdom of 
a people. We've been taught to 
scorn all that as superstition. 
Most teachers are women, of 
course." 

"Before our time, men knew?" 
I gave him his straight line. 

"Oh, yes," Harry said. "Homer. 
Ovid, Swift — 'A dead wife under 
the table is the best goods in a 
mari*s house,* said Swift. Antiphanes, Menander. Cato — there 
was a wise one. 'Suffer women 
once to arrive at an equality with 
you, and they will from that moment become your superiors.' 
Plautus, Clement of Alexandria, 
Tasso, Shakespeare, Dekker, 
Fletcher, Thomas Browne — the 
list is endless. The Bible: 'How 
can he be clean that is born of 
woman?'; 'All wickedness is but 
little to the wickedness of a woman'; 'I suffer not a woman to 
teach, nor to usurp authority over 
the man, but to be in silence'. . ." 

For fifteen minutes he continued, covering the Greeks, the 



Romans, the Renaissance, and 
hadn't begun to run dry. Even 
for Harry this' was digging deep 
for a story. This is Harry's peak, 
I said to myself, a little awed. 
He will never do anything better 
than this. 

f T^HEN Harry began getting 
closer to modern times. 
" 'Women are much more like 
each other than men,' said Lord 
Chesterfield. And Nietzsche : 
'Thou goest to women? Don't forget thy whip.' Then there was 
Strindberg, touched by a divine 
madness which gave him visions 
of hidden truths. Shaw concealed 
his suspicions in laughter lest he 
be torn to pieces — " 

"Ibsen?" I suggested, chuckling, dredging a name out of my 
school days that I vaguely remembered was somehow connected with the subject. 

Harry spat, as if he had something vile in his mouth. 

"Ibsen! That traitor! That 
blind fool! It was he who first 
dramatized the insidious propaganda which led, eventually, to 
the so-called emancipation of 
women, and was really the loosing of the chains which kept them 
from ravening unrestrained." 

"Ravening," I chortled. "That's 
the word, all right — ravening!" 

"You must go back to folk 
sayings to get real truth," Harry 
went on, quieting a little. " 'A 



116 



G-A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



man is happy only two times 
in his life,' say the Jugoslavs, 
'when he marries a wife and when 
he buries her.' Or the Rumanians : 
'When a man takes a wife, he 
ceases to dread Hell.' Or the 
Spanish : 'Who hath a wife hath 
also an enemy.' 'Never believe a 
woman, not even a dead one,' advise the German peasants. The 
wisdom of the Chinese: 'Never 
trust a woman, even though she 
has given you ten sons'." 

He stopped, not as if he were 
near the end of his material, but 
to begin brooding. 

"Did you ever look for something," he asked, "a collar button, say, or a particular pair of 
socks — and it isn't there and you 
tell your wife? Why is it that 
she can come and pick it up and 
it's been right under your nose 
all the time?" 

"What else have they got to 
think about?" 

"It makes you wonder," he insisted. "It makes you wonder if 
it really was there when you 
looked." 

I agreed with him, and thought, 
Strange, the odd truths that Harry can link into something excrutiatingly funny. 

"They have no respect for 
logic," said Harry. "No respect 
at all for the sanctity of a man's 
mind, for what his world is built 
upon. They argue as it suits them, 
waving away contradictions and 



inconsistencies as meaningless. 
How many of us have our Xanthippes, bent on dragging us down 
from our contemplation of divine 
truth to the destructive turmoil of 
daily strife? It's maddening, maddening!" 

A thought struck me. So far, 
Harry had a number of strings, 
amusing in themselves, but lacking the climax that would wind 
them all up into a neat ball of 
laughter. 

"What would they do," I asked, 
smiling, "if they discovered that 
someone knew their secret? They 
couldn't let it get around, could 
they?" 

Harry smiled in return. For one 
unwary second, I thought he was 
slipping, giving the joke away. 

"There," said Harry, "you have 
hit upon the crux. If my snrmises 
are true, why has no one else 
discovered it? And the answer is 
— they have I" 

"They have ?" I repeated , a 
little surprised. 

"Oh, yes," Harry answered, 
nodding. "And it provides the 
clincher. The women would have 
to do away with them, of course. 
Silence them. And it would have 
to show up somewhere — if one 
knew where to look." 

"Yes?" I prompted, breathlessly. 

"Why," he said, pointing a 
finger at me, "are there more 
men in asylums than women?" 



THE MISOGYNIST

"You mean — ?" 
He nodded. 

I collapsed, hysterical. I choked 
with laughter. It was only with 
difficulty that I was able to speak 
when the women came in a moment later with their bowls and 
potato chips and glasses of beer. 

"Hi, alien," I spluttered at 
Jane. 

And I laughed some more, especially when I looked at Harry 
and saw the stricken face he was 
putting on, horrified, terribly 
frightened, sort of all sunk in on 
himself — better, much better, than 
I've seen a professional actor do 
it on the screen. 

Finally the look on the women's faces brought me around — 
the bored look — and I tried to 
share the joke. Harry was laughing, too, kind of weakly- — surprising, because he always is sort of 
bland and mildly curious when 
one of his stories gets everybody 
writhing. 

So I started telling it and got 
part way through and — well, you 
know the way it ends. I looked at 
Harry for help, but he wasn't 
giving any, and I kind of died 
away slowly. 

"It must be the way he tells 
it," I sighed. "Nobody can tell 
stories like Harry." 

You see what I mean. Women 
don't think Harry's funny. 

The evening turned out all 
right, though. A little flat at the 



end, the way evenings usually are. 

As we were going out, I heard 
Lucille say, kind of sharp, "Harry, there's something wrong with 
the hot water heater. You've been 
promising to look at it for days, 
and you've just got to do something about it tonight because I'm 
going to be washing tomorrow," 
and I heard Harry answer, "Yes, 
dear," mild and obedient, and 
I thought, The guy's got to blow 
off steam somewhere, and figured 
that I'd be hearing the story 
again at the office. 

Which goes to show how wrong 
a man can be. 

NEXT morning, Lucille called 
up and said Harry was sick — 
a stroke or a heart attack or 
something — and couldn't come to 
work. I called there a couple of 
times, but Lucille told me he was 
too sick to see anybody. I knew 
Harry was really sick because 
Lucille had Dr. Clarke, that woman doctor, and Harry's said he 
wouldn't have her treat his sick 
dog if he wanted the dog to get 
well. So I knew Harry was too 
sick to care. 

It's funny how quick a fellow 
can go, and I got to thinking what 
a shame it was that Harry's finest 
effort, the climax of his wit, so 
to speak, should go with him, and 
how it's too bad that great vocal 
art should vanish without leaving, 
a trace. 



THE MISOGYNIST 



So I began trying to remember 
— and I couldn't remember very 
good, particularly the quotations 
— so I did a little research of my 
own, just to be able to give a 
sample. I ran across a couple 
Harry missed. 

One of them everybody knows. 
The one of Kipling's that begins, 
"The female of the species ..." 
The other one I worked up by 
myself, just thinking. Why, I asked myself one day, are there more 
widows than widowers? Of 
course, I couldn't think of an 
answer. 

It's a shame about Harry. A 
great guy like that, a humorist 
who never was given the chance to 
share his gift with the world — 
if you ask me, funnier than anybody on radio or TV or the stage ; 
anywhere, for that matter — and 
here he is getting set to kick off. 
The least I can do is reconstruct 
this biggest gag he ever put together as a kind of monument 
to him. 

Well, it's finished. I'll show it 
to the boys in the office tomorrow. 
They'll get a real kick out of it. 
No sense showing it to the girls, 
even Jane — like I said, women 
never thought Harry was funny. 

Something else he left out, but 
probably only because he didn't 
have enough time to develop the 
gag the way he usually does. 
What kind of planet did the 
aliens come from? It must have 



a lot of carbon dioxide. Ever 
notice how women always complain when you open a window? 
It must be a hot world, too; 
they're cold all the time, especially their feet, which they like 
to put against their husband's 
legs, making the poor guy practically leap out of bed. I'm an 
expert on that — Jane's toes would 
chill any highball. But their 
world can't be that hot, because 
women can trot around in the 
coldest weather with practically 
nothing underneath their coats. 
And how about those open-toe 
shoes? 

It doesn't add up at all. I 
suppose Harry would shrug it off 
as another proof of their alienness. Possibly he'd say it was just 
outside that women were warm; 
it's in the house that they're cold. 

Well, there you are — Jane is 
calling me to come down to the 
cellar and fix the furnace. There 
isn't a thing wrong with it. I'm 
sweating, as a matter of fact. But 
if I don't go down and monkey 
around with the grate and draft, 
I'll never hear the end of it. And 
I'd better go just to save the furnace; Jane's banging it with a 
poker, yelling up to me that she'll 
fix it if I don't. 

Jane with a poker; there's a 
laugh for you. She can't even 
wind a clock without breaking 
the mainspring.

THE CRYSTAL HORDE by 
John Taine. Fantasy Press, Reading, Pa., 1952. 254 pages, $3.00 

*X1HIS tale contains one of the 
most magnificent science-horror ideas ever created in the 
Earth- cataclysm genre, and probably the worst yellow- menace plus - Bolsheviks - plus - religious prejudice melange ever to hit 
science fiction. It was originally 
published in 1930 under the title 
White Lily and even today, the 
science horror remains unsurpassed, despite its politico-sociological lumber. 

The basic idea is of a semisentient, semi -explosive crystal


line life form, living off calcium, 
silicon or cellulose, depending on 
its nature at the moment. Taine's 
superb word pictures of how the 
causative green dye went from 
its original eggshell (curiously apt 
symbolism there!) under young 
Tom Lane's bed in Los Angeles, 
on and on until it was devouring 
entire mountain ranges in the 
western desolation above Shanghai, are without doubt masterpieces of sheer evocation, superb 
verbal inventions that no other 
science fiction writer has ever 
outclassed.

Chinks" who in their stupidity 
kill each other off, and the Pure 
and Beautiful Chinese gal, White 
Lily, and her yawnsome warfare 
with the lecherous Russian agent, 
we would have a truly impressive 
piece of imaginative writing. 

Much of it is, of course. But 
it seems to me that a publisher's 
obligation includes modernizing 
social attitudes as well as science, 
in the old novels he chooses to 
disinter. 

LANDS BEYOND byL.Sprague 
de Camp and Willy Ley. Rinehart & Co., Inc., New York, 1952. 
329 pages plus index, $4.75 

A FASCINATING book? the 
natural history of pres»ientific science fiction; the story 
of the imagined lands and their 
impossible wonders that have 
stirred men to travel and dream 
ever since before the days of 
Homer. 

The collaborators, both skilled 
in ferreting out little-known information in the fields of the 
natural sciences and anthropology, have put their heads — and 
libraries— together here to tell of 
many marvels from Atlantis to 
Eldorado, from Mu to the earthly 
Paradise. 

I particularly reveled in the 
pages on Mu, including the fantastic etymology of the name of 
that grand old dream continent; 



in the narrative of Prester John 
and his fantastic, more- than magnificent, imaginary kingdom 
which duped kings and popes; 
and in the collection of theories 
about the shape of the Earth, 
culminating in the astonishing 
semi-official Nazi theory that the 
globe was a hollow sphere with 
all of us inside it! 

But everything in the book is 
fascinating, if you are among 
those curious -minded readers 
who compose a large proportion 
of the mature science fiction 
audience. You will admire its 
authors' erudition, at the same 
time that you will be delighted 
with their pleasantly offhand 
methods of displaying it. 

Wonderful for the younger 
generations, too — fabulous tales 
that are much better than Captain Video!

XTERE is a slick, fast-paced

of rapid-fire bedtime reading. 

It really is two detective novelets, both concerned with involvements arising from the discovery 
of a method of duplicating matter. The first part sets the stage 
with a commercial spy story — a 
villain is duplicating rare drugs 
and bootlegging them. 

The hero ends by marrying a 
duplicated gal — and very nice 
she is, too. 

Part two, which is considerably 
better than the first, tells how it 
was possible to steal from a hermetically sealed, robot-piloted 
cargo plane a huge sum of money. 
This is definitely the latest twist 
in the locked-room school of 
murder mysteries, and a highly 
effective one.

ics. They are five rip -snorting 
adventure stories with interplanetary, time-travel and other 
standard backgrounds, all certain 
to fascinate 12-to-17-year-olds — 
and up. 

The tales are primitive, of 
course, but they are written in 
acceptable English, rather than 
the space-pirate jargon that encrusts so many of the cheaper 
pulps and comics. 

To be briefly laconic: 

Hunter's tale tells of some future time travelers lost in the 
ancient wilds of Yucatan who 
start the Mayan myths; Latham's 
book describes an Earth family 
battling the horrid botany and 
zoology of Venus; del Rey's deals 
with a spaceship stowaway, a lad 
oi 18 who becomes one of the 
first Earthmen on Mars — and a 
tough life, too; Jones offers an 
effective morality about how an 
alien visitor makes friends with 
an Earth lad and eventually 
staves off an invasion by his own 
kind, even though the attack was 
provoked by the bureaucrats who 
were running Earth; and finally 
Lesser's melodramatic and unlikely tale tells of the space cadet 
compelled to take part in the 
nasty activities of an interplanetary gang. 

They're good as gifts to youngsters on birthdays and Christmas. 
Wish I had them when I was a

SPACE HAWK by Anthony Gilmote. Greenberg: Publisher, New 
York, 1952. 274 pa^es, $2.75 

IN some ways, this book represents the lowest point I have 
ever reached in my delvings into 
the dim half -world of space opera. 
This may be due to the fact that 
the incredible nonsense of its plot 
and characters is heightened by 
its oddly effective writing — the 
tawdriness of its imagination thus 
becomes all the more visible. 

Its hero, Hawk Carse, is in the 
worst tradition of juvenilia, as is 
its villain (actual quote) : "the 
brilliant egomaniac Dr. Ku Sui 
. . . devoid of every kindly human 
trait." Its fall-guy is (again a 
quote) : " 'Friday,' the big black 
Earthman whom Carse had rescued . . . from one of the Venusian slave-ships," of whom Carse 
was wont to say, "You're a good 
mechanic, Friday, but in some 
ways you're very innocent." 

Not 'arf as innocent as the 
author himself! 

The adventures go from absurdity to absurdity; the villains 
become more ludicrous from page 
to page; and Carse himself ends 
up a figure of fun, so hopelessly 
impossible is he. 

THE SWORD OF CONAN by 
Robert E. Howard. Gnome Press, 
New York, 1952. 251 pages, $2.75 



124 




 



HERE'S another of the same 
ilk as Hawk Carse. Even 
though this is the tale of a prehistoric hero, it still is also just 
another demijohn of corn. I give 
you Conan — 

"A tall man, mightily shouldered and deep of chest, with a 
massive corded neck and heavily 
muscled limbs. His brow was 
low and broad under a square-cut 
black mane," (incidentally. Hawk 
Carse also had square-cut flaxen 
hair — "bangs," they're called — 
something of a new-style male 
hairdo, it would seem, "his eyes 
a volcanic blue that smoldered 
as if with some inner fire. His 
dark, scarred, almost sinister face 
was that of a fighting man, and 



his velvet garments could not 
conceal the hard, dangerous lines 
of his limbs." 

This is volume two of the adventures of this "timber wolf" 
(page 144) of the so-called Hyperborean Age between the fall 
of Atlantis and the arrival of the 
"Sons of Aryas." Like the first, 
it is full of blood, sex, sadism, 
violence, the sort of overwriting 
quoted above— all the garish 
trappings of escape into the 
Greater Past of the Natural Man. 

Our age may one day be known 
as the Spillane Era. Conan fits 
right in, except that he has heroism where Mike Hammer is 
capable only of viciousness.

A thin speck appeared in the 
visor plate and grew with sinister 
and terrifying speed. Bursts of 
flame began to play around the 
rocketing spaceship, the explosions hurtling it from side to side 
as it twisted and turned in a frantic effort to escape. Rogue

narrowed, heart pounding, knew 
that this was it.

themselves to the print, seizing 
upon the meaningless words as 
if they would save him from a

retribution that Rogue Rogan 
had never had to fear. 

The dorm master frowned 
from the doorway. "Plato, didn't 
you hear the Assembly bell?" 

"Assembly?" Plato's eyes 
looked up in mild astonishment. 
"No, sir, I didn't hear any bell. 
I was so absorbed in my studying, sir — " He shut the book and 
placed it back with the others. 
"I'm sorry, sir. I'm willing to accept my punishment." 

The dorm master studied the 
little martyr's expression. "You'd 
better be, Plato. Now live up to 
your name and show some intelligence. Run along to Assembly." 

Plato ran, but he also winced. 
How he had suffered from that 
miserable name of his! Even before he had known that the original Plato had been a philosopher, 
even before he had been capable 
of understanding what a philosopher was, he had been able to see 
the amused expression in the eyes 
of those who heard his name, and 
had hated them for it. "Show a 
little intelligence, Plato." Why 
couldn't they have given him a 
name like the others? There were 
so many ordinary, commonplace, 
manly names from which they 
might have chosen. Jim, Jack, 
George, Tom, Bill — anything 
would have been better than 
Plato. And infinitely better than 
what he was sometimes called by 

RUNAWAY 



his equals — "Plato, the dopy 
philosopher." 

HE slipped into his seat in the 
Assembly quietly, so as not 
to interrupt the droning of the 
principal. So they thought his 
name was funny, did they? Let 
them laugh at him. He was only 
ten now, but some day he would 
really" act like a man. Some day 
it would be he himself, and not a 
fictional hero like Comets Carter, 
who would be adventuring on 
strange planets of unknown suns, 
tracking down the Rogans and 
the other criminals who sought 
refuge in the wide reaches of 
galactic space. 

Some day — and then the 
thought burst on him like a nova 
exploding in his brain. 
Why not now? 

Why not indeed? He was 
smart; he could take care of himself. Even his masters admitted 
that, when they weren't carping 
at him for his daydreaming. Take 
that model of a spaceship they 
had brought to school one day, 
with a retired astrogator to explain to the pupils how the thing 
was run, and how it avoided stray 
meteors. He had sat down at the 
controls, and even the astrogator 
had been surprised at how confidently he took over the role of 
pilot, how he got the idea at once. 

He could do as well in real 
life. He was sure of it. GiVe him 

127 



a really worthwhile problem to 
work on, instead of these silly 
questions about square roots and 
who discovered the third satellite 
of Mars, and he'd show them. 

"Thus," declaimed the principal, "you will be prepared to take 
up your duties — " 

"Norberts to you" thought 
Plato. "I'm going to run away." 

Where to? There were so many 
stars to go to, such a bewildering 
number of planets and asteroids. 

Plato sat lost in thought. A 
planet whose habitation required 
a spacesuit was out of the ques


tion. Spacesuits his size were hard 
to get. The sensible thing would 
be to choose a place where the 
physical conditions, from gravity 
to atmospheric pressure and composition would tend to resemble 
those here on Venus or on Earth. 
But full of the most thrilling 
danger. 

A boy's voice said, "Get up, 
you dopy philosopher. It's all 
over." 

He raised his head and realized 
that the principal had stopped 
droning from the platform, that 
all the pupils were standing up to 



128 




 



leave. He stood up and marched 
out. 

When the signal for lights out 
came that night, Plato lay motionless for a time in the dark, 
his mind racing far too rapidly 
for him to think of sleep. He had 
plans to make. And after a time, 
when the dormitory quieted 
down, he went to the well of 
knowledge for inspiration. He 
slipped on his pair of goggles and 
threw the special switch he himself had made. The infra-red 
light flared on, invisible to any 
one in the room but himself, and 
he drew his book from its hiding 
place and resumed his reading. 

The ship curvetted in space 
like a prancing steed. Panicstricken by the four-dimensional 
space-warp in which he was 
trapped, Rogue Rogan stormed 
at his terrified followers. "By all 
the devils of the Coal Sack" he 
shouted, "the man doesn't live 
who can take me alive! You'll 
fight and die like men, you henhearted cowards . . ." 

But they didn't die like men. 
In fact, they didn't die at all, and 
Plato permitted a slight sneer to 
play across his youthful features. 
Though he considered himself a 
passionate admirer of Comets 
Carter, even he felt dissatisfied 
with the story. When they were 
trapped, they were never realty 



trapped. Comets Carter, sterling 
hero that he usually was, always 
showed weakness of intellect at 
the last moment, giving his 
deadly enemy an incredibly simple way out. one that Comets 
had, in his own incredibly simple 
way, overlooked. 

Plato would never be guilty of 
such stupidity. He himself — and 
now he was Comets Carter, a 
quicker-thinker, smarter Carter, 
dealing out to Rogue Rogan a 
retribution many eons overdue. 
He was whistling through space 
at ten light-speeds. He was compressing light-centuries into a 
single second. He was — 

He had just time to slip the 
goggles from his face before his 
eyes closed in sleep. 

TOURING the day, he continued to make his plans. There 
was a spaceport a hundred and 
forty miles away. At night, if the 
students poked their heads out of 
the window, they could see the 
distant ships as points of flame 
racing away into the darkness, 
like shooting stars in reverse. He 
would steal out of his room in 
the night, take a glider train to 
the spaceport, and stow away. It 
would be as simple as that. 

Of course, he needed money. 
He might travel at half fare, but 
even that would be expensive. 
And then there was the matter 
of food. He'd have to stay hidden 



RUNAWAY 



729 



until the spaceship took off and 
there was no turning back, and 
at the thought of crouching in 
some dark hold, motionless for 
hours, cramped, and with an 
empty stomach — 

He wasn't going to starve himself. Even Comets Carter couldn't 
have gone without eating and got 
very far in his pursuit of Rogan. 
Plato would have to acquire 
money for flight, fare and food. 

The book, of course, he couldn't 
think of selling. It was only a 
decicredit novel in the first place, 
and somewhat worn at that. And 
the other students would have 
laughed at him for reading it. 
But his infra-red bedside lamp 
and his goggles and the space-receptor radio he had built out of 
«pare parts — those should bring 
him enough to travel and live on 
for a few days. 

He made his firsi: sale in the 
free time that evening, to a young 
squirt in the neighboring dormitory who had a passion akin to 
his own. He liked to listen to tales 
of high adventure, of the kind 
the radiocasters loved and the 
teachers in the school frowned 
upon. Having arrived here from 
Earth only six months before, he 
had difficulty adjusting to the 
type of derring-do featured on 
the Venus stations, and he lacked 
a space-receptor that would bring 
him his favorites from the next 
planet. He snapped up, at the 



bargain price of ten credits, the 
receptor that Plato offered. 

There was a little difficulty 
with the infra-red lamp and goggles. The customer Plato had selected turned out to be rather 
suspicious. He demanded, "Where 
did you steal them?" 

Plato explained patiently, "I 
didn't steal them. I made them 
myself." ■ 

"That's a lot of hot oxo-nitrogen. You hooked them some 
place, and if they ever find out — " 

"Okay," said Plato, "if you 
don't want them, you don't have 
to take them. I can sell them to 
somebody else." 

He allowed the young skeptic 
to try the goggles on and read by 
the light of the lamp. He knew 
little of the psychology of salesmanship, but with what might 
be called Platonic shrewdness, he 
sensed that once the prospect had 
experienced the joys of using the 
magic articles, he would never 
give them up. 

The method worked. And soon 
Plato was richer by fifteen credits, instead of the ten or twelve he 
had hoped for. 

He had a few other odds and 
ends, which he sold for as much 
as they would bring. After all, 
once he was out in space, he 
wouldn't need them any more. 

TN the middle of the next day, 
when the bell sounded the end 



130 




 



of the class on Planetary Geography and it was time to go to 
the class on Animal Physiology, 
Plato picked himself up and 
walked out. One of the 'copter 
custodians looked at him suspiciously, but Plato didn't dignify 
the man by paying him direct attention. 

He muttered to himself, "Always picking on me. I don't see 
why he can't send somebody else 
on his errands." It was better 
than the forged pass signed with 
the headmaster's name. 

The pass itself came in handy 
when he bought a flight ticket. 
The ticket agent also stared at 
him suspiciously, but Plato was 
ready for him. He had prepared 
the slip of paper beforehand, 
tracing the headmaster's name 
laboriously from one of the lists 
of regulations attached to the 
wall. 

To make pursuit as difficult as 
possible for any one who tried to 
trail him. Plato asked for a ticket 
not to Space Junction, where he 
was going, but to Venusberg, in 
the opposite direction. Both tickets cost about the same; the ticket to Venusberg, in fact, cost 
three decicredits more. Once on 
the plane-drawn glider, he could 
explain to the conductor that the 
agent had made a mistake and 
offer the ticket he had. Since the 
company would lose nothing by 
the transaction, there was no 



reason why the conductor should 

object. 

Plato was proud of this bit of 
trickery, and he flattered himself 
that by means of it he had entirely thrown off pursuit. It must 
be remembered that he was only 
ten years old. 

On the glider- flight, he found 
himself sitting next to a middleaged woman who wore glasses 
and was surrounded by packages. 
She beamed at him, as she did at 
every one else around her, and 
Plato shrank back into his seat. 
If there was anything he didn't 
want on this trip, it was 'to be 
mothered. 

But he couldn't escape her. She 
said, "My, my, you're awfully 
young to be traveling alone. This 
the first time?" * 

"Yes, ma'am," said Plato nervously, afraid of the embarrassing 
questions he could read on her 
face. 

Hastily he stared out over the 
side and gasped, "Gee, how small 
everything is!" 

Imagine anyone who had traveled vicariously through space 
with Comets Carter being awed 
by a flight in a plane - drawn 
glider! But the ruse worjeed. 

She said, "Yes, it is frightening, 
isn't it? Even worse than space 
travel." 

"Y ou've been in space, 
ma'am?" 

"Bless your heart, I've been in 



RUNAWAY 



131 



space more times than you could 
shake a stick at. The takeoff 
isn't so nice. I'll admit, but after 
that you're just sailing free. 
What are you going to be when 
you grow up?" 

They had his future all planned for him, but he knew that he 
wasn't going to be any of the 
things they wanted him to be. 

He said boldly, "A space explorer." 

She laughed. "You youngsters 
are all alike inside, no matter how 
different you seem. My boy was 
the same way when he was young. 
But he got over it. A space explorer, no less!" 

I3LATO didn't answer. It was 
only a half hour's trip, and 
the ^pnductor was walking down 
the aisle. Plato found it difficult 
to take his eyes off him. He was 
afraid that the man would take 
a look at his ticket, say, "Wrong 
plane, son," and turn him over 
to the stationmaster at Space 
Junction, to be shipped back. 

In his nervousness, Plato had 
difficulty getting his ticket out of 
his pocket. As he had expected, 
the conductor said, "You're on 
the wrong flight." 

The motherly woman exclaimed, "Oh, isn't that a shame! Are 
they waiting for you in Venusberg?" 

Plato said tearfully, "Yes, 
ma'am." The tearfulness wasn't 



hard to manage; he'd learned the 
trick at school. 

"That's too bad. How are you 
going to get there?" 

"I don't know. I had just 
enough money to pay for this 
ticket." 

"Doesn't the company correct 
mistakes, Conductor?" 

"Not mistakes the passengers 
make," said the conductor sourly. 
"I'm sorry, boy, I'll have to take 
that ticket." 

The woman's eyes flashed and, 
as the conductor moved on, she 
said, "The nasty thing. They 
have no consideration at all, 
Look, child." For a moment Plato thought she was going to offer 
him flight fare from Space Junction to Venusberg, but she was 
not, he discovered, as motherly 
as that. "You know what you'll 
do when you get off? Send a 
'gram, collect, to your people in 
Venusberg. They'll wire you your 
fare. And you'll reach them in a 
couple of hours." 

"Thank you, ma'am," he said, 
not feeling thankful at all. So it 
was all right to be sympathetic, 
he thought indignantly, up to the 
point where sympathy might cost 
her money. Like most people, she 
was free-handed only with advice. 

Who wanted advice? 

A T Space Junction he waved 
her a shy farewell, and then 



132 




 



turned and disappeared into the 
station crowd. 

At the takeoff grounds, his 
heart sank. As he might have expected,-- the entrance to the space 
tarmac was well guarded. How 
was he going to become a stow- . 
away on a spaceship if he 
couldn't even get close to it? 

He wandered around outside, 
staring through the charged wire 
fence at the crowds, the spacemen, the ships inside. They were 
gigantic shining things, those 
wonderful ships, each so long that 
he realized for the first time how 
far away they must have been 
and how rapidly they must have 
traveled, for those he saw had 
seemed to him like shooting stars. 
They were pointed almost 
straight up. Near the stern of 
each ship was a vacuum-pit to 
absorb the radioactive exhaust 
gases. 

His eye caught an old tub, its 
shininess dulled, its hull faintly 
scarred. Just such a ship, he 
thought with a thrill, as the one 
on which Comets Carter had 
been shanghaied on that momentous occasion when . . , 

The old freighter swung a great 
circle, its torsion jets blasting 
desperately in an effort to keep 
it on an even keel. This, thought 
Comets Carter, was it. This was 
the foul revenge that Rogue Rogan had planned, the evil death 



he had plotted with his unhuman 
companions. In a moment the 
pulsating radiations of electroid 
rays would set off the cargo of 
ghoulite, and when the interplanetary echoes of the explosion died 
away, Comets Carter would be 
no more than a series of photon 
packets, his body torn apart, his 
very atoms converted into radiation that was hurtling with the 
speed of light to the far corners 
of the universe . . . 

It hadn't happened that way, 
of course. But if it had happened 
— well, it might have on just 
such a tub as this. 

A guard saw him peering 
through the fence, and said, 
"What are you looking at, kid?" 

"Those ships," said Plato, honestly enough. And then he added, 
to throw the man off the track, 
"Gee, I'd be scared to go up in 
one of them. No, sir, you couldn't 
get me into one of them for a 
million credits." 

The man laughed. "They're 
not for the likes of you. A lot of 
those ships go to other stars." 

"Other stars? Gosh! Does that 
little one, the Marie T. — " 

"That tub? Just an interplanetary freighter. But even that isn't 
for you. Now run along and mind 
your own business." 

Plato was happy to run along. 
Unfortunately, he realized, running along didn't help him to get 



RUNAWAY 



133 



past the fence. 

And then he had a fear-inspiring thought. He couldn't tell an 
interplanetary ship from an interstellar. What if he did manage, 
somehow, to get in and stow 
away — and then found himself 
on a ship bound for no more distant port than Earth, from which 
he could easily be sent home in 
disgrace? 

It sent a shiver through him. 
Fortunately, it also stimulated his 
mind. After all, there were such 
things as newspapers, and the 
school, nuisance in many ways 
though it was, had taught him to 
read. 

TTE bought a paper and turned 
at once to the shipping news 
section. As he had hoped, every 
ship was listed. He checked off 
some of the names he had 
glimpsed on the field, and found 
happily that their destinations 
were printed in the most routine 
manner.
There still remained the question of how to get past the guards. 
This, he suddenly realized, was 
a question impossible to solve on 
an empty stomach. It had been 
many hours since he had eaten 
lunch. 

There were a dozen restaurants 
in the spaceport, and he selected 
one carefully, studying the illuminated menus and the prices 
before daring to enter. If that 



motherly old woman had been 
as kind-hearted as she pretended 
to be, he wouldn't have had to 
worry so much about prices. As 
it was, he knew that he had money enough for only two days, and 
after that — his stomach could 
complain all it wanted to, it 
would have to go unfed. 

He chose from the menu only 
items that he never tasted at 
school — dishes made from real 
plant and animal life, with just 
enough synthetics to give them 
flavor. He couldn't say that he 
liked what he ate, but at least it 
gave him the feeling of being on 
his own, of having made' the 
break with his tame past as complete as possible. Earth-beef 
tasted too strong; Venus seaweed 
stew had a pungency that he 
didn't like. 

He finished his plate only because he had been taught that to 
leave food over was wasteful. 
And for the first time he began 
to wonder what they would feed 
him on the spaceship. Suppose he 
got on one that wasn't scheduled 
to make port for five years — and 
all he received to eat was stuff 
like this? The thought made him 
shudder. Here was a hardship of 
space travel that the books he 
read had never mentioned. 

After eating, he slumped back 
in his chair. He hadn't realized 
he was so completely exhausted 
until a hand shook his shoulder. 



134 




 



Then he awoke with a start. 

A waiter said, "This is no place 
to sleep, youngster." 

"I'm sorry, sir. I was tired and 
I didn't realize." 

"You been here for a long 
time. Waiting for someone?" 

"Yes, sir. Something must have 
held him up." 

"Seems to me that I noticed 
you walk in here about three 
hours ago. That's a long time to 
wait." 

"That's what I thought, sir. I 
can't understand what happened." 

"Well, you can't hang around 
here. I'll tell you what I'll do, 
though. I'll turn you over to the 
matron in our Lost and Found 
room, and she'll look out for 
you. Follow me." 

IN a da2e, Plato followed. But 
as his feet were set into motion, so was his brain. By now, 
of course, the search for him 
must be well on. They must have 
traced him to the station, and 
perhaps, despite his clever trick 
with the ticket, they had found 
the flight he had taken. For all 
he knew, they might be waiting 
for him in the Lost and Found 
room, ready to sei2e him the moment he^ showed his face there. 

He hadn't gone so far to be recaptured so easily. As they passed 
an exit door, Plato darted out. He 
heard the waiter's surprised 



shout, but he didn't wait to reply. In a second, he had lost 
himself in the crowd. 

He knew now that if he was 
going to get aboard an interstellar vessel, he would have to do 
so soon. What would Comets 
Carter have done in Plato's place 
— if Comets had been in one of 
his brighter moods? And then he 
had it. He saw a messenger coming down the street, gleaming in 
his uniform, and, somewhat nervously, approached him. 

"May I speak to you?" asked 
Plato, with school-taught politeness. 

"What about, bud? I'm busy." 

"Well, I've been wanting to get 
Captain Halverson's autograph. 
He's on the Space Symphony — " 

"So what?" 

"Well, the thing is, they won't 
let me past the gate. So I thought 
that if I wore a messenger's uniform — " 

The other boy glared at him. 
"Are you off your Norbert? I 
wouldn't let you wear this uniform for a zillion credits." 

Plato swallowed nervously, and 
said in desperation, "I don't have 
a zillion credits, but I've got 
eight, and I'll give them to you 
if you let me wear it. Just half an 
hour, that's all it'll take. It's the 
last chance I'll have to ask him. 
He's bound for Rigel, and he 
won't be back for five years, and 
you see — " 



RUNAWAY 



135 



His voice tapered to a thin, 
tearful squeak as the messenger 
looked at him. 

"You're offering me eight 
space-lousy credits?" 

"It's all I have. We'll just 
change clothes for a few minutes, 
and that'll be all. Please, I've got 
to see him. I know that if I do, 
he'll give me his autograph." 

"Okay," said the messenger unexpectedly. "But hurry back. I'll 
be at the gate, waiting for you." 

AS they exchanged clothes, 
Plato was almost feverish 
with excitement. But he knew 
that if he expected to get past the 
guard, he would have to control 
himself. The clothes didn't fit too 
well, even though the messenger 
was^small, and he must do nothing that would arouse the guard's 
suspicion. 

He said to the messenger, "Gee, 
thanks. You don't know how 
much this means to me." And 
then, with a mental grip on himself so tense that it hurt physically, he approached the guard, 
and said casually, "Earth 'gram 
for Captain Halverson." 

The guard hardly looked at 
him. He was past the gate! 

He had been tricky again. 
Once out of sight of the guard, 
he made not for the Space Symphony, but for the Long Ranger, 
bound for Aldebaran. 

"Earth 'gram for Captain 



Brinjar," he muttered, doing his 
best to look bored, as if delivering 'grams to ships was an old 
thing to him. And then he was 
aboard! 

It was not quite what he expected. The smooth walls were 
such as he might have found in 
his own dormitory. The quarters, 
he saw, were cramped, although 
for someone his size they were at 
least adequate. And the passageways, although brilliantly lighted, were mere narrow tunnels. 

From the main passageway, 
other tunnels branched off bewilderingly, and Plato hesitated 
until he realized that his very 
confusion gave him an excuse for 
poking his nose into all sorts of 
places. He followed one of the 
tunnels until he came to a door: 

ENGINE ROOM — KEEP OUT. 

He entered. A mechanic looked 
up. 

"Earth 'gram for Captain Brinjar. They said he was around 
here." 

"Not here," replied the mechanic. "Try the cargo hold." 

Plato backed out and set off 
down the corridor again, noting 
the direction arrows and signs. 

TO MAIN LOUNGE — no good. TO 

captain's cabin — worse. He 
didn't want to find the captain 
and lose his excuse for being 
there. 

And then he saw to food storage and knew that he need look 



136 




 



no further. This was a place both 
to hide and to eat, until the ship 
took off, and the crew found him, 
and had to accept him as one of 
themselves. 

He opened the door to the food 
storage hold with an elaborate 
caution that turned out to be unnecessary. There was no one inside. He settled down between 
two packing cases and let out his 
breath. He had made it. He had 
stowed away successfully, and 
in a few hours he would be out in 
space, traveling between the 
stars, fighting, adventuring — 

A yawn almost wiped the 
smile off his face. 

ITE awoke to disaster. The captain and Plato's dorm master 
were standing there, staring down 
at him, and the dorm master was 
saying, "All right, Plato, you've 
had your adventure, and now I'm 
afraid you'll have to pay for it. 
It's time to go home." 

Plato couldn't move. It was 
impossible, after he had been so 
clever, so ingenious, and had 
thrown them off the trail in so 
many ways, for them to have 
found him! 

"You shouldn't have bought a 
' ticket to the wrong station," said 
the dorm master, somewhat 
amusedly. "When the conductor 
turned it in, the only one of its 
kind on his flight, it naturally attracted attention. We hadn't even 



suspected you had taken a glidertrain until the flight people came 
to us." 

Now he would never adventure 
on strange planets of unknown 
suns. He would never course 
through space like Comets Carter. He would never have the adventures which alone made life 
seem worth living. 

Unable to control himself, he 
burst into tears. It was a completely unmanly thing to do, but 
he couldn't help himself. The 
tears flowed down over his 
cheeks, washing away all his shattered illusions. He would never 
dream such dreams again. From 
now on, it would be useless. They 
would be watching him carefully 
to make sure that he didn't leave 
the planet. 

He heard the captain say in 
astonishment, "I didn't know 
these young ones could cry like 
that." 

"Of course they cry," replied 
the dorm master. "They eat, 
sleep, cry — almost like you and 
me, Captain. And worst of all, 
they even have their dreams. 
That's why I sometimes wonder, 
Captain, if it isn't a mistake to 
send them to school." 

"They have to learn." 

"Granted*," agreed the dorm 
master somberly. "But not to 
dream of being human when 
they're only androids."

amusement, played the piano 
rather well, and wrote fair poetry 
for the University's literary quarterly. She was well-read, wellrounded, well - informed. She 
loved and was loved. 

Then why this quiet misery? 

Wanting something, expecting 
nothing, she stared out into the 
darkness of the stone-walled garden. The night was too quiet. A 
distant street lamp played in the 
branches of the elm, and the 
elm threw its shadow across another wing of ' the house. She 
watched the shadow's wandering 
for a time. A lone car purred past 
in the street and was gone. A 
horn sounded raucously in the 
distance. 

What was wrong? A thousand 
tinjes since childhood she had felt 
this uneasy stirring, this crawling of the mind that called out 
for some unfound expression. It 
had been particularly strong in 
recent weeks. 

SHE tried to analyze. What was 
different about recent weeks? 
Events: Frank's job had sent him 
on the road for a month; the 
children were at Mother's ; the 
city council had recommended a 
bond issue ; she had fired her 
maid; a drunk had strangled his 
wife; the University had opened 
its new psychophysics lab; her 
art class had adjourned for the 
summer. 



Nothing there. No clue to the 
unreasoning, goalless urge that 
called like a voice crying in mental wilderness: "come, share, satisfy, express it to the fullest!" 

Express what? Satisfy what? 
How? 

A baby, deserted at birth and 
dying of starvation, would feel 
terrible hunger. But if it had 
never tasted milk, it could not 
know the meaning of the hunger 
nor how to ease it. 

"/ need to relate this thing to 
something else, to something in 
my own experience or in the experience of others." She had tried 
to satisfy the urge with the goals 
of other hungers: her children, 
her husband's lovemaking, food, 
drink, art, friendship. But the 
craving was something else, crying for its pound of unknown 
flesh, and there was no fulfillment. 

"How am I different from 
others?" she asked herself. But 
she was different only in the 
normal ways that every human 
being is different from the exact 
Average. Her intelligence was 
high, short of genius, but superior. To a limited extent, she felt 
the call of creativity. Physically, 
she was delicately beautiful. The 
only peculiarities that she knew 
about seemed ridiculously irrelevant: a dark birthmark on her 
thigh, a soft fontanel in the top 
of her long narrow head, like the 



142 




 



soft spot in an infant's cranium. 
Silly little differences! 

One big difference: the quiet 
misery of the unfed hunger. 
, A scattering of big raindrops 
suddenly whispered on the walk 
and in the grass and through the 
foliage of the elm. A few drops 
splattered on the screen, spraying 
her face and arms with faint 
points of coolness. It had been 
oppressively hot. Now there was 
a chill breath in the night. 

Reluctantly she closed the 
window. The oppression of the 
warm and empty house increased. 
She walked to the door opening 
into the walled garden. 

Ready for a lonely bed, she 
was wearing a negligee over nothing. Vaguely, idly, her hand 
fumbled at the waist-knot, loosened it. The robe parted, and the 
fine spray of rain was delightfully cool on her skin. 

The garden was dark, the 
shadows inky, the nearest neighbor a block away. The wall 
screened it from prying eyes. She 
brushed her hands over her 
shoulders ; the sleeves slipped 
down her arms. Peeled clean, 
feeling like a freed animal, she 
pressed - open the screen and 
stepped out under the eaves to 
stand on the warm stone walk. 

rj^HE rain was rattling in the 
hedge and roaring softly all 
about her, splashing coldness 



about her slender calves. She 
hugged herself and stepped into 
it. The drench of icy fingers 
stroked her with pleasant lashes; 
she laughed and ran along the 
walk toward the elm. The drops 
stung her breasts, rivered her 
face, and coursed coldly down her 
sides and legs. 

She exulted in the rain, tried 
to dance and laughed at herself. 
She ran. Then, tired, she threw 
herself down on the crisp wet 
lawn, stretching her arms and 
legs and rolling slowly on the 
grass. Eyes closed, drenched and 
languorous, she laughed softly 
and played imagining games with 
the rain. 

The drops were steel-jacketed 
wasps, zipping down out of the 
blackness, but she melted them 
with her mind, made them soft 
and cool and caressing. The drops 
took impersonal liberties with 
her body, and she rolled demurely to He face down in the rainsoft grass: 

"/ am still a pale beast," she 
thought happily, "still kin of my 
grandmother the ape who danced 
in the tree and chattered when it 
rained. How utterly barren life 
would be, if I were not a pale 
beast!" 

She dug her fingers into the 
sodden turf, bared her teeth, 
pressed her forehead against the 
ground, and growled a little animal growl. It amused her, and she

143 



laughed again. Crouching, she 
came up on her hands and knees, 
hunching low, teeth still bared. 
Like a cat, she hissed — and 
pounced upon a sleeping bird, 
caught it and shook it to death. 

Again she lay laughing in the 
grass. 

"If Frank were to see me like 
this," she thought, "he would put 
me to bed with a couple of sleeping pills, and call that smug Dr. 
Mensley to have a look at my 
mind. And Dr. Mensley would 
check my ambivalences and my 
repressions and my narcissistic, 
voyeuristic, masochistic impulses. 
He would tighten my screws and 
readjust me to reality, fit me into 
a comfortable groove, and take 
the pale beast out of me to make 
me« talking doll." 

He had done it several times 
before. Thinking of Dr. Mensley, 
Lisa searched her vocabulary for 
the most savage word she could 
remember. She growled it aloud 
and felt better. 

The rain was slowly subsiding. 
A siren was wailing in the distance. The police. She giggled 
and imagined a headline in 
tomorrow's paper : prominent 

SOCIALITE JAILED FOR INDECENT 

exposure. And the story would 
go on: "Mrs. Lisa Waverly was 
taken into custody by the police 
after neighbors reported that she 
was running around stark naked 
in her back yard. Said Mrs. 



Heinehoffer who called the law: 
'It was just terrible. Looked to 
me like she was having fits.' Mr. 
Heinehoffer, when asked for 
comment, simply closed his eyes 
and smiled ecstatically." 

Lisa sighed wearily. The siren 
had gone away. The rain had 
stopped, except for drippings out 
of the elm. She was tired, emotionally spent, yet strangely melancholy. She sat up slowly in the 
grass and hugged her shins. 

The feeling came over her 
gradually. 

"Someone has been watching 
me!" 

SHE stiffened slowly, but remained in place, letting her 
eyes probe about her in the 
shadows. If only the drippings 
would stop so she could listen! 
She peered along the hedge, and 
along the shadows by the garden 
wall, toward the dark windows of 
the house, up toward the lowhanging mist faintly illuminated 
from below by street lights. She 
saw nothing, heard nothing. 
There was no movement in the 
night. Yet the feeling lingered, 
even though she scoffed. 

"// anyone is here" she 
thought, '77/ call them gently, 
and if anyone appears, 77/ scream 
so loud that Mrs. Heinehoffer 
will hear me." 

"Hey!" she said in a low voice, 
but loud enough to penetrate any 



144 




 



of the nearby,, shadows. 

There was no answer. She folded her arms behind her head and 
spoke again, quietly, sensually. 

"Come and get me." 

No black monster slithered 
from behind the hedge to devour 
her. No panther sprang from the 
elm. No succubus congealed out 
of wet darkness. She giggled. 

"Come have a bite." 

No bull-ape came to crush her 
in ravenous jaws. 

She had only imagined the eyes 
upon her. She stretched lazily 
and picked herself up, pausing to 
brush off the leaves of grass 
pasted to her wet skin. It was 
over, the strange warship in the 
rain, and she was weary. She 
walked slowly toward the house. 

Then she heard it — a faint 
crackling sound, intermittent, 
distant. She stood poised in the 
black shadow of the house, listening. The crackle of paper . . . 
then a small pop . . . then crisp 
fragments dropped in the street. 
It was repeated at short intervals. 

Taking nervous, shallow 
breaths, she tiptoed quietly toward the stone wall of the garden. It was six feet high, but 
there was a concrete bench under 
the trellis. The sound was coming from over the wall. She 
stood crouching on the bench; 
then, hiding her face behind the 
vines, she lifted her head to peer. 

The street lamp was half a 



block away, but she could see 
dimly. A man was standing across 
the street in the shadows, apparently waiting for a bus. He 
was eating peanuts out of a paper 
bag. tossing the shells in the 
street. That explained the crackling sound. 

She glared at him balefully 
from behind the trellis. 

'77/ claw 'your eyes our," she 
thought, 'Hi you came and peeped over my wall" 

"Hi!" the man said. 

T ISA stiffened and remained 
motionless. It was impossible 
that he could see her. She was in 
shadow, against a dark background. Had he heard her foolish babbling a moment ago? 

More likely, he had only cleared his throat. 

"Hi!" he said again. 

Her face was hidden in the 
dripping vines, and she could not 
move without rustling. She froze 
in place, staring. She could see 
little of him. Dark raincoat, dark 
hat, slender shadow. Was he 
looking toward her? She was 
desperately frightened. 

Suddenly the man chucked the 
paper bag in the gutter, stepped 
off the curb, and came sauntering across the street toward the 
wall. He removed his hat. and 
crisp blond hair glinted in the 
distant streetlight. He stopped 
three yards away, smiling-uncer

tainly at the vines. 

Lisa stood trembling and frozen, staring at him in horror. 
Strange sensations, utterly alien, 
passed over her in waves. There 
was no describing them, no understanding them. 

"I — I found you," he stammered sheepishly. "Do you know 
what it is?" 

"/ know you," she thought. 
"You have a small scar on the 
back of your neck, and a mole between your toes. Your eyes are 
blue, and you have an impacted 
wisdom tooth, and your feet are 
hurting you because you walked 
all the way out here from the 
University, and Vm almost old 
enough to be your mother. But I 
can't know you, because I've 
neVer seen you before/" 

"Strange, isn't it?" he said uncertainly. He was holding his hat 
in his hand and cocking his head 
politely. 

"What?" she whispered. 

He shuffled his feet and stared 
at them. "It must be some sort 
of palpable biophysical energyform, analytically definable — if 
we had enough data. Lord knows, 
I'm no mystic. If it exists, it's 
got to be mathematically definable. But why us?" 

Horrified curiosity made her 
step aside and lean her arms on 
the wall to stare down at him. 
He looked up bashfully, and his 
eyes widened slightly. 

146 



"Oh!" 

"Oh what?" she demanded, 
putting on a terrible frown. 

"You're beautiful!" 

"What do you want?" she asked icily. "Go away!" 

"I — " He paused and closed his 
mouth slowly. He stared at her 
with narrowed eyes, and touched 
one hand to his temple as if 
concentrating. 

FOR an instant, she was* no 
longer herself. She was looking up at her own shadowy face 
from down in the street, looking 
through the eyes of a stranger 
who was not a stranger. She was 
feeling the fatigue in the weary 
ankles, and the nasal ache of a 
slight head cold, and the strange 
sadness in a curious heart — a 
sadness too akin to her own. 

She rocked dizzily. It was like 
being in two places at once, like 
wearing someone else's body for 
a moment. 

The feeling passed. "It didn't 
happen!" 'she told herself. 

"No use denying it," he said 
quietly. "I tried to make it go 
away, too, but apparently we've 
got something unique. It would 
be interesting to study. Do you 
suppose we're related?" 

"Who are you?" she choked, 
only half-hearing his question. 

"You know my name," he said, 
"if you'll just take the trouble to 
think about it. Yours is Lisa — 


 



Lisa O'Brien, or Lisa Waverly — 
I'm never sure which. Sometimes 
it comes to me one way, sometimes the other." 

She swallowed hard. Her maiden name had been O'Brien. 

"I don't know you," she snapped. 

His name was trying to form 
in her mind. She refused to a^low 
it. The young man sighed. 

"I'm Kenneth Grearly, if you 
really don't know." He stepped 
back a pace and lifted his hat 
toward his head. "I — I guess I 
better go. I see this disturbs you. 
I had hoped we could talk about 
it, , but — well, good night, Mrs. 
Waverly." 

He turned and started away. 

"Wait!" she called out against 
her will. 

He stopped again. "Yes?" 

"Were — were you watching me 
— while it was raining?" 

He opened his mouth and 
stared thoughtfully down the 
street toward the light. "You 
mean watching visually?" You 
really are repressing this thing, 
aren't you? I thought you understood." He looked at her sharply, 
forlornly. "They say the failure 
to communicate is the basis of all 
tragedy. Do you suppose in our 
case . . . ?" 

"What?" 

"Nothing/* He shifted restlessly for a moment. "Good night." 
"Good night," she whispered 



many seconds after he was gone. 

T¥ER bedroom was hot and 
lonely, and she tossed in 
growing restlessness. If only 
Frank were home! But he would 
be gone for two more weeks. The 
children would be back on Monday, but that was three whole 
days away. Crazy! It was just 
stark raving crazy! 

Had the man really existed — 
what was his name ? — Kenneth 
Grearly? Or was he only a phantasm invented by a mind that was 
failing — her mind? Dancing 
# naked in the rain! Calling out to 
shadow shapes in the brush ! 
Talking to a specter in the street! 
Schizophrenic syndrome — dreamworld stuff. It could not be otherwise, for unless she had invented 
Kenneth Grearly, how could she 
know he had sore feet, an impacted wisdom tooth, and a head 
cold. Not only did she know 
about those things, but she felt 
them! 

She buried her face in the dusty 
pillow and sobbed. Tomorrow she 
would have to call Dr. Mensley. 

But fearing the specter's return, she arose a few minutes 
later and locked all the doors in 
the house. When she returned to 
bed, she tried to pray but it was 
as if the prayer were being 
watched. Someone was listening, 
eavesdropping from outside. 

Kenneth Grearly appeared in

her dreams, stood half-shrouded 
in a slowly swirling fog. He stared 
at her with his head cocked aside, 
smiling slightly, holding his hat 
respectfully in his hands. 

"Don't you realize, Mrs. Waverly, that we are mutants perhaps?" he asked politely. 

"No!" she screamed. "I'm happily married and I have three 
children and a place in society! 
Don't come near me!" 

He melted slowly into the fog. 
But echoes came monotonously 
from invisible cliffs: mutant mutant mutant mutant mutant . . . 

Dawn came, splashing pink 
paint across the eastern sky. The 
light woke her to a dry and empty 
consciousness, to a headachy 
awareness full of dull anxiety. 
She arose wearily and trudged to 
the* kitchen for a pot of coffee. 

Lord! Couldn't it all be only a 
bad dream? 

In the cold light of early morning, the things of the past night 
looked somehow detached, unreal. She tried to analyze objectively. 

That sense of sharing a mind, 
a consciousness, with the strariger 
who came out of the shadows — 
what crazy thing had he called 
it? — "some sort of palpable biophysical energy-form, analytically definable." 

"If I invented the stranger," 
she thought, "/ must have also 
invented the words." 



But where had she heard such 
words before? 

T ISA went to the telephone and 
*-* thumbed through the directory. No Grearly was listed. If he 
existed at all, he probably lived 
in a rooming house. The University — last night she had thought 
tha£ he had something to do with 
the University. She lifted the 
phone and dialed. 

"University Station; number 
please," the operator said. 

"I — uh — don't know the extension number. Could you tell me 
if there is a Kenneth Grearly connected with the school?" 

"Student or faculty. Madam?" 

"I don't know." 

"Give me your number, please, 
and I'll call you back." 

"Lawrence 4750. Thanks, Operator." 

She sat down to wait. Almost 
immediately it rang again. 
"Hello?" 

"Mrs. Waverly, you were calling me?" A man's voice. His 
voice! 

"The operator found you rather quickly." It was the only 
thing she could think of saying. 

"No, no. I knew you were calling. In fact, I hoped you into it." 

"Hoped me? Now look here, 
Mr. Grearly, I — " 

"You were trying to explain our 
phenomenon in terms of insanity 
rather than telepathy. I didn't 



148 




 



want you to do that, and so I 
hoped you into calling me." 

Lisa was coldly speechless. 
"What phenomenon are you talking about?" she asked after a few 
dazed seconds. 

"Still repressing it? Listen, I 
can share your mind any time I 
want to, now that I understand 
where and who you are. You 
might as well face the fact. And 
it can work both ways, if you 
let it. Up to now, you've been — 
well, keeping your mind's eye 
* closed, so to speak." 

Her scalp was crawling. The 
whole thing had become intensely 
disgusting to her. 

"I don't know what you're up 
to, Mr. Grearly, but I wish you'd 
stop it. I admit something strange 
is going on, but your explanation 
is ridiculous — offensive, even." 

He was silent for a long time, 
then: "I wonder if the first manape found his prehensile thumb 
ridiculous. I wonder if he thought 
using his hands for grasping was 
offensive." 

"What are you trying to say?" 

"That I think we're mutants. 
We're not the first ones. I had 
this same experience when I was 
in Boston once. There must be 
one of us there, too, but suddenly 
I got the feeling that he had committed suicide. I never saw him. 
We're probably the first ones to 
discover each other." 

"Boston? If what you say is 



true, what would distance have 
to do with it?" 

"Well, if telepathy exists, it 
certainly involves transfer of 
energy from one point to another. 
What kind of energy, I don't 
know. Possibly electromagnetic 
in character. But it seems likely 
that it would obey the inverse 
square law, like radiant energyforms. I came to town about 
three weeks ago. I didn't feel you 
until I got close." 

"There is a connection," she 
thought. She had been wondering 
about the increased anxiety of 
the past three weeks. 

"I don't know what you're 
talking about," she evaded icily, 
though. "I'm no mutant. I don't 
believe in telepathy. I'm not insane. Now let me alone." 

She slammed the telephone in 
its cradle and started to walk 
away. 

Evidently he was angry, for 
she was suddenly communicating 
with him again. 

OHE reeled dizzily and clutched 
^ at the wall, because she was 
in two places at once, and the 
two settings merged in her mind 
to become a blur, like a double 
exposure. She was in her own 
hallway, and she was also in an 
office, looking at a calculator 
keyboard, hearing glassware rattling from across a corridor, 
aware of the smell of foFmalde

of neural arcs still remained. She 
fought him, but his mind lingered 
in hers. 

". . . perhaps we can get to the 
bottom of it. I know my encephalograph recordings are abnormal,

I'm glad to know about her soft

Now I think that underneath that 
fontanel lies a pattern of specialized neural — " 

She sagged to the floor of the 
hall and babbled aloud: "Hickory Dickory Dock, the mouse 
ran up the clock. The clock 
struck one — " 

Slowly he withdrew. The laboratory office faded from her 
vision. His thoughts left her. She 
lay there panting for a time. 
Had she won? 

No, there was no sense in claiming victory. She had not driven 
him away. He had withdrawn of 
his own volition when he felt her 
babbling. She knew his withdrawal was free, because she had felt 
his parting state of mind: sad| ness. He had stopped the forced 
contact because he pitied her,

into the parlor and sat shivering 
on the sofa. 

Last night! That crazy running 
around in the -rain! He was responsible for that. He had hoped 
her into doing it, or maybe he 
had just wondered what she 
looked like undressed, and she 
had subconsciously satisfied his 
curiosity. He had planted the 
suggestion — innocently, perhaps 
— and she had unknowingly 
taken the cue. 

He could be with her whenever 
he wanted to! He had been with 
her while she frollicked insanely 
in the rain-sodden grass! Perhaps 
he was with her now. 

Whom could she talk to? 
Where could she seek help? Dr. 
Mensley? He would immediately 
ch»lk it up as a delusion, and 
probably call for a sanity hearing if she wouldn't voluntarily 
enter a psycho-ward for observation. 

The police? "Sergeant. I want 
to report a telepathic prowler. A 
man is burglarizing my mind." 

A clergyman? He would shudder and refer her to a psychiatrist. 

AH roads led to the boobyhatch, it seemed. Frank wouldn't 
believe her. No one would believe 
her. 

T ISA wandered through the 
day like a caged animal. She 
put on her brightest summer 



frock and a pert straw hat and 
went downtown. She wandered 
through the crowds in the business district, window-shopping. 
But she was alone. The herds of 
people about her brushed past 
and wandered on. A man 
whistled at her in front of a cigar 
store. A policeman waved her 
back to the curb when she started across an intersection. 

"Wake up, lady!" he called 
irritably. 

People all about her, but she 
could not tell them, explain to 
them, and so she was alone. She 
caught a taxi and went to visit 
a friend, the wife of an English 
teacher, and drank a glass of iced 
tea in the friend's parlor, and 
talked of small things, and admitted that she was tired when 
the friend suggested that she 
looked that way. When she went 
back home, the Sun was sinking 
in the west. 

She called long distance and 
talked to her mother, then spoke 
to her children, asked them if 
they were ready to come home, 
but they wanted to stay another 
week. They begged, and her 
mother begged, and she reluctantly consented. It had been a 
mistake to call. Now the kids 
would be gone even longer. 

She tried to call Frank in St. 
Louis, but the hotel clerk reported that he had just checked 
out. Lisa knew this meant he was 



152 




 



on the road again. 

"Maybe / ought to go join the 
kids at Mother's," she thought. 
But Frank had wanted her to 
stay home. He was expecting a 
registered letter from Chicago, 
and it was apparently important, 
and she had to take care of it. 

"Vll invite somebody over," 
she thought. But the wives were 
home with their husbands, and it 
was a social mistake to invite a 
couple when her husband was 
gone. It always wound up with 
two women yammering at each 
other while the lone male sat and 
glowered in uneasy isolation, occasionally disagreeing with his 
wife, just to let her know he was 
there and he was annoyed and 
bored and why didn't they go 
home? It was different if the 
business-widow called on a couple. Then the lone male could 
retire to some other part of the 
house to escape the yammering. 

But she decided it wasn't company she wanted; she wanted 
help. And there was no place to 
get it. 

WHEN she allowed her 
thoughts to drift toward 
Kenneth Grearly, it was almost 
like tuning in a radio station. He 
was eating early dinner in the 
University cafeteria with a bedraggled, bespectacled brunette 
from the laboratory. Lisa closed 
her eyes and let herself sift gin


gerly into his thoughts. His attention was on the conversation 
and on the food, and he failed to 
realize Lisa's presence. That 
knowledge gave her courage. 

He was eating Swiss steak and 
hashed brown potatoes, and the 
flavors formed perceptions in her 
mind. She heard the rattle of 
silverware, the low murmur of 
•voices, and smelled the food. She 
marveled at it. The strange ability had apparently been brought 
into focus by learning what it 
was and how to use it. 

"Our work has been too empirical," he was saying. "We've 
studied phenomena, gathered data, looked for correlations. But 
that method has limitations. We 
should try to find a way to approach psychology from below. 
Like the invariantive approach 
to physics."' 

The girl shook her head. 
"The nervous system is too 
complicated for writing theoretical equations about it. Empirical 
equations are the best we can 
do." 

"They aren't good enough, 
Sarah. You can predict results 
with them, inside the limits of 
their accuracy. But you can't extrapolate them very well, and 
they won't stack up together into 
a single integrated structure. And 
when you're investigating a new 
field, they no longer apply. We 
need a broad mathematipal the

ory, covering all hypothetically 
possible neural arrangements. It 
would let us predict not only results, but also predict patterns of 
possible order." 

"Seems to me the possible patterns are infinite." 

"No, Sarah. They're limited 
by the nature of the building 
blocks — neurons, synaptic connections, and, so forth. With 
limited materials, you have structural limitations. You don't 
build skyscrapers out of modeling clay. And there is only a finite 
number of ways you can build 
atoms out of electrons, protons 
and neutrons. Similarly, brains 
are confined to the limitations of 
the things they're made of. We 
need a broad theory for defining 
th^limits." 

"Why?" 

"Because . . ." He paused. Lisa 
felt his urge to explain his urgency, felt him suppress it, felt 
for a moment his loneliness in 
the awareness of his uniqueness 
and the way it isolated him from 
humanity. 

"V^OU must be doing new 
work," the girl offered, "if you 
feel the lack of such a theoretical 
approach. I just can't imagine 
an invariantive approach to psychology — or an all -defining set of 
laws for it, either. Why do you 
need such a psychological 'Relativity'?" 



He hesitated, frowning down at 
his plate, watching a fly crawl 
around its rim. "I'm interested in 
— in the quantitative aspects of 
nerve impulses. I — I suspect that 
there can be such a thing as neural resonance." 

She laughed politely and shook 
her head. "I'll stick to my empirical data - gathering, thank 
you." 

Lisa felt him thinking: 

"She could understand, if I 
could show her data. But my data 
is all subjective, experimental, 
personal. I share it with that 
Waverly woman, but she is only a 
social thinker, analytically shallow, refusing even to recognize 
facts. Why did it have to be her? 
She's flighty, emotional, and in a 
cultural rut. If she doesn't conform, she thinks she's nurs. But 
then at least she's a woman — and 
if this is really a mutation, we'll 
have to arrange for some children . . ." 

Lisa gasped and sat bolt upright. Her shock revealed her 
presence to him, and he dropped 
his fork with a clatter. 

"Lisa.'" 

She wrenched herself free of 
him abruptly. She angrily stalked 
about the house, slamming doors 
and muttering her rage. The 
nerve! The maddening, presumptuous, ill-mannered, self -centered, 
overly educated boor! 

Arrange for some children in

deed! An impossible situation! 

As her anger gathered momentum, she contacted him again — 
like a snake striking. Thought 
was thunder out of a dark cloud. 

"I'm decent and Fm respectable, Mr. Grearly! I have a husband and three fine children and 
I love them, and you can go to 
hell! I never want to see you 
again or have you prowling 
around my mind. Get out and 
STAY out. And if you ever bother me again — /'// — Fll kill you." 

He was outdoors, striding 
across the campus alone. She saw 
the gray buildings, immersed in 
twilight, felt the wind on his face, 
hated him. He was thinking nothing, letting himself follow her 
angry flow of thought. When she 
finished, his thoughts began like 
the passionate pleading of a 
poem. 

He was imagining a human 
race with telepathic abilities, in 
near-perfect communication with 
one another. So many of the 
world's troubles could be traced 
to imperfect communication of 
ideas, to misunderstandings. 

Then he thought briefly of 
Sarah — the nondescript laboratory girl he had taken to dinner — 
and Lisa realized he was in love 
with Sarah. There were sadness 
and resentment here. He couldn't 
have Sarah now, not if he were 
to be certain of perpetuating the 
mutant' characteristic. The Wav


erly woman ought to be good for 
three or four children yet, before 
she reached middle age. 

T ISA stood transfixed by shock. 

Then he was thinking directly 
to her. 

"Fm sorry. You're a beautiful, 
intelligent woman — but I dorit 
love you. We're not alike. But I'm 
stuck with you and you're stuck 
with me, because Fve decided it's 
going to be that way. I can't convince you since your thinking 
habits are already fixed, so I 
won't even try. Fm sorry it has 
to be against your will, but in 
any event it has to be. And now 
that I know what you're like, I 
don't dare wait — for fear you'll 
do something to mess things up." 

"No!" she screamed, watching 
the scenery that moved past his 
field of vision. 

He had left the campus and 
was walking up the street — toward her neighborhood. He was 
walking with the briskness of purpose. He was coming to her 
house. 

"Call the police!" she thought, 
and tried to dissolve him out of 
her mind. 

But this time he followed, clung 
to her thoughts, would not let 
her go. It was like two flashlight 
beams playing over a wall, one 
trying to escape, the other following its frantic circle of brightness.

She staggered, groped her way 
toward the hall, which was confused with a superimposed image 
of a sidewalk and a street. A 
phantom automobile came out of 
the hall wall, drove through her 
and vanished. Double exposures. 
He stared at a street light and 
it blinded her. At last she found 
the phone, but he was laughing 
at her. 

"Eight seven six five twentyone Mary had a little lamb seven 
seven sixry-seven yesterday was 
May March April . . ." 

He was deliberately filling her 
mind with confusion. She fumbled at the directory, trying to 
fyid the police, but he thought a 
confused jumble of numbers and 
symbols, and they scampered 
ao*oss the page, blurring the letters. 

She whimpered and groped at 
the phone-dial, trying to get the 
operator, but he was doing something with his fingertips, and she 
couldn't get the feel of the dial. 

On her third try, it finally 
worked. 

"Information," said a pleasant 
impersonal voice. 

She had to get the police! She 
had to say — ; 

"Pease porridge hot, pease porridge cold, pease porridge in the 
pot, nine days pretty polly parrot 
played peacefully plentiwise 
pease porridge . . ." 

He was jamming her speech 



156

centers with gibberish, and she 
blurted nonsense syllables into 
the mouthpiece. 

"You'll have to speak more distinctly, madam. I can't understand you." 

"Poress, Policer . . ." 

"The police? Just a moment." 

A series of jumbled sounds and 
visions clouded her mind. Then a 
masculine voice rumbled, "Desk, 
Sergeant Harris." 

She found a clear path through 
tne confusion and gasped, "Threeoh - oh - three Willow Drive — 
'mergency — come quick — man 
going to — " 

"Three - oh - oh - three Willow. 
Check. We'll have a car right over 
there." 

She hung up quickly — or tried 
to-^but she couldn't find the 
cradle. Then her vision cleared, 
and she screamed. She wasn't in 
the hall at all! 

The telephone was an eggbeater! 




IS voice came through her 
trapped panic. 



"You might as well give in," 
he told her with a note of sadness. 
"I know how to mess you up like 
that, you see. And you haven't 
learned to retaliate yet. We're going to cooperate with this evolutionary trend, whether you like it 
or not — but it would be more 
pleasant if you agree to it." 

"No!" 



"All right, but Vm coming anyway. I hoped it wouldn't be like 
this. I wanted to convince you 
gradually. Now I know that it's 
impossible." 

He was still ten blocks away. 
She had a few minutes in which 
to escape. She bolted for the door. 
A black shadow-shape loomed up 
in the twilight, flung its arms 
wide, and emitted an apelike roar. 

She yelped and darted back, 
fleeing frantically for the front. A 
boa constrictor lay coiled in the 
hall; it slithered toward her. She 
screamed again and raced toward 
the stairway. 

She made it to the top and 
looked back. The living room was 
filling slowly with murky water. 
She rushed shrieking into the 
bedroom and bolted the door. 

She smelled smoke. Her dress 
was on fire! The flames licked up, 
searing her skin. 

She tore at it madly, and got 
it off, but her slip was afire. She 
ripped it away, scooped up the 
flaming clothing on a transom 
hook, opened the screen, and 
dropped them out the window. 
Flames still licked about her, and 
she rolled up in the bed-clothing 
to snuff them out. 

Quiet laughter. 

"New syndrome," he called to 
her pleasantly. "The patient confuses someone else's fantasy with 
her own reality. Not schizophrenia — duophrenia, maybe?" 



158 




 



She lay sobbing in hysterical 
desperation. He was just down 
the street now, coming rapidly 
up the walk. A car whisked slowly 
past. He felt her terrified despair 
and pitied her. The torment 
ceased. 

She stayed there, panting for a 
moment, summoning spirit. He 
was nearing the intersection just 
two blocks south, and she could 
hear the rapid traffic with his 
ears. 

Suddenly she clenched her eyes 
closed and gritted her teeth. He 
was stepping off the curb, walking across — 

She imagined a fire engine 
thundering toward her like a 
juggernaut, rumbling and wailing. 
She imagined another car racing 
out into the intersection, with herself caught in the cross-fire. She 
imagined a woman screaming, 
"Look out, Mister!" 

And then she was caught in 
his own responding fright, and it 
was easier to imagine. He was 
bolting for the other corner. She 
conjured a third car from another 
direction, brought it lunging at 
him to avoid the impending 
wreck. He staggered away from 
the phantom cars and screamed. 

A real car confused the scene. 

She echoed his scream. There 
was a moment of rending pain, 
and then the vision was gone. 
Brakes were still yowling two 
blocks away. Someone was run


ning down the sidewalk. A part of 
her mind had heard the crashing 
thud. She was desperately sick. 

And a sudden sense of complete aloneness told her that 
Grearly was dead. A siren was 
approaching out of the distance. 

VOICES from the sidewalk: 
", . . just threw a fit in the 
middle of the street . . . running 
around like crazy and hollering 
... it was a delivery truck . . . 
crushed his skull . . . nobody else 
hurt . . ." 

After the street returned to 
normal, she arose and went to 
get a drink of water. But she 
stood staring at her sick white 
face in the mirror. There were 
crow's feet forming at the corners 
of her eyes, and her skin was 
growing tired, almost middleaged. 

It was funny that she should 
notice that now, at' this strange 
moment. She had just killed a 
man in self-defense. And no one 
would believe it if she told the 
truth. There was no cause for 
guilt. 

Was there? 
. Frank would be back soon, and 
everything would be the same 
again: peace, security, nice kids, 
nice home, nice husband. Just the 
way it always had been. 

But something was already 
different. An emptiness. A loneliness of the mind that ■ she had

never before felt. She kept looking around to see if the lights 
hadn't gone dim, or the clock 
stopped ticking, or the faucet 
stopped dripping. 

It was none of those things. 
The awful silence was within her. 

Gingerly, she touched the soft 
spot in the top of her head and 
felt an utter aloneness. She closed 
her eyes and thought a hopeless 



plea to the Universe: 

"Is there anybody else like me? 
Can anybody hear me?" 

There was only complete silence, the silence of the voiceless 
void, 

And for the first time in her 
life she felt the confinement of 
total isolation and knew it for 
what it was.
