Command Performance By WALTER M. MILLER, JR. 




cold brass voice. She stood mo- a short, rich thatch of warm red 



tionless, leaning against the hair. She had a good dependable 

drapes by the window, alone. The husband, three children, and se
night was black, the house emp- curity. She had friends, hobbies, 

ty and silent. social activities. She painted 

"Come, Lisa!" she told herself, mediocre pictures for her own 

amusement, played the piano 
rather well, and wrote fair poetry 
for the University's literary quarterly. She was well-read, wellrounded, well - informed. She 
loved and was loved. 

Then why this quiet misery? 

Wanting something, expecting 
nothing, she stared out into the 
darkness of the stone-walled garden. The night was too quiet. A 
distant street lamp played in the 
branches of the elm, and the 
elm threw its shadow across another wing of ' the house. She 
watched the shadow's wandering 
for a time. A lone car purred past 
in the street and was gone. A 
horn sounded raucously in the 
distance. 

What was wrong? A thousand 
tinjes since childhood she had felt 
this uneasy stirring, this crawling of the mind that called out 
for some unfound expression. It 
had been particularly strong in 
recent weeks. 

SHE tried to analyze. What was 
different about recent weeks? 
Events: Frank's job had sent him 
on the road for a month; the 
children were at Mother's ; the 
city council had recommended a 
bond issue ; she had fired her 
maid; a drunk had strangled his 
wife; the University had opened 
its new psychophysics lab; her 
art class had adjourned for the 
summer. 



Nothing there. No clue to the 
unreasoning, goalless urge that 
called like a voice crying in mental wilderness: "come, share, satisfy, express it to the fullest!" 

Express what? Satisfy what? 
How? 

A baby, deserted at birth and 
dying of starvation, would feel 
terrible hunger. But if it had 
never tasted milk, it could not 
know the meaning of the hunger 
nor how to ease it. 

"/ need to relate this thing to 
something else, to something in 
my own experience or in the experience of others." She had tried 
to satisfy the urge with the goals 
of other hungers: her children, 
her husband's lovemaking, food, 
drink, art, friendship. But the 
craving was something else, crying for its pound of unknown 
flesh, and there was no fulfillment. 

"How am I different from 
others?" she asked herself. But 
she was different only in the 
normal ways that every human 
being is different from the exact 
Average. Her intelligence was 
high, short of genius, but superior. To a limited extent, she felt 
the call of creativity. Physically, 
she was delicately beautiful. The 
only peculiarities that she knew 
about seemed ridiculously irrelevant: a dark birthmark on her 
thigh, a soft fontanel in the top 
of her long narrow head, like the 



142 




 



soft spot in an infant's cranium. 
Silly little differences! 

One big difference: the quiet 
misery of the unfed hunger. 
, A scattering of big raindrops 
suddenly whispered on the walk 
and in the grass and through the 
foliage of the elm. A few drops 
splattered on the screen, spraying 
her face and arms with faint 
points of coolness. It had been 
oppressively hot. Now there was 
a chill breath in the night. 

Reluctantly she closed the 
window. The oppression of the 
warm and empty house increased. 
She walked to the door opening 
into the walled garden. 

Ready for a lonely bed, she 
was wearing a negligee over nothing. Vaguely, idly, her hand 
fumbled at the waist-knot, loosened it. The robe parted, and the 
fine spray of rain was delightfully cool on her skin. 

The garden was dark, the 
shadows inky, the nearest neighbor a block away. The wall 
screened it from prying eyes. She 
brushed her hands over her 
shoulders ; the sleeves slipped 
down her arms. Peeled clean, 
feeling like a freed animal, she 
pressed - open the screen and 
stepped out under the eaves to 
stand on the warm stone walk. 

rj^HE rain was rattling in the 
hedge and roaring softly all 
about her, splashing coldness 



about her slender calves. She 
hugged herself and stepped into 
it. The drench of icy fingers 
stroked her with pleasant lashes; 
she laughed and ran along the 
walk toward the elm. The drops 
stung her breasts, rivered her 
face, and coursed coldly down her 
sides and legs. 

She exulted in the rain, tried 
to dance and laughed at herself. 
She ran. Then, tired, she threw 
herself down on the crisp wet 
lawn, stretching her arms and 
legs and rolling slowly on the 
grass. Eyes closed, drenched and 
languorous, she laughed softly 
and played imagining games with 
the rain. 

The drops were steel-jacketed 
wasps, zipping down out of the 
blackness, but she melted them 
with her mind, made them soft 
and cool and caressing. The drops 
took impersonal liberties with 
her body, and she rolled demurely to He face down in the rainsoft grass: 

"/ am still a pale beast," she 
thought happily, "still kin of my 
grandmother the ape who danced 
in the tree and chattered when it 
rained. How utterly barren life 
would be, if I were not a pale 
beast!" 

She dug her fingers into the 
sodden turf, bared her teeth, 
pressed her forehead against the 
ground, and growled a little animal growl. It amused her, and she

143 



laughed again. Crouching, she 
came up on her hands and knees, 
hunching low, teeth still bared. 
Like a cat, she hissed — and 
pounced upon a sleeping bird, 
caught it and shook it to death. 

Again she lay laughing in the 
grass. 

"If Frank were to see me like 
this," she thought, "he would put 
me to bed with a couple of sleeping pills, and call that smug Dr. 
Mensley to have a look at my 
mind. And Dr. Mensley would 
check my ambivalences and my 
repressions and my narcissistic, 
voyeuristic, masochistic impulses. 
He would tighten my screws and 
readjust me to reality, fit me into 
a comfortable groove, and take 
the pale beast out of me to make 
me« talking doll." 

He had done it several times 
before. Thinking of Dr. Mensley, 
Lisa searched her vocabulary for 
the most savage word she could 
remember. She growled it aloud 
and felt better. 

The rain was slowly subsiding. 
A siren was wailing in the distance. The police. She giggled 
and imagined a headline in 
tomorrow's paper : prominent 

SOCIALITE JAILED FOR INDECENT 

exposure. And the story would 
go on: "Mrs. Lisa Waverly was 
taken into custody by the police 
after neighbors reported that she 
was running around stark naked 
in her back yard. Said Mrs. 



Heinehoffer who called the law: 
'It was just terrible. Looked to 
me like she was having fits.' Mr. 
Heinehoffer, when asked for 
comment, simply closed his eyes 
and smiled ecstatically." 

Lisa sighed wearily. The siren 
had gone away. The rain had 
stopped, except for drippings out 
of the elm. She was tired, emotionally spent, yet strangely melancholy. She sat up slowly in the 
grass and hugged her shins. 

The feeling came over her 
gradually. 

"Someone has been watching 
me!" 

SHE stiffened slowly, but remained in place, letting her 
eyes probe about her in the 
shadows. If only the drippings 
would stop so she could listen! 
She peered along the hedge, and 
along the shadows by the garden 
wall, toward the dark windows of 
the house, up toward the lowhanging mist faintly illuminated 
from below by street lights. She 
saw nothing, heard nothing. 
There was no movement in the 
night. Yet the feeling lingered, 
even though she scoffed. 

"// anyone is here" she 
thought, '77/ call them gently, 
and if anyone appears, 77/ scream 
so loud that Mrs. Heinehoffer 
will hear me." 

"Hey!" she said in a low voice, 
but loud enough to penetrate any 



144 




 



of the nearby,, shadows. 

There was no answer. She folded her arms behind her head and 
spoke again, quietly, sensually. 

"Come and get me." 

No black monster slithered 
from behind the hedge to devour 
her. No panther sprang from the 
elm. No succubus congealed out 
of wet darkness. She giggled. 

"Come have a bite." 

No bull-ape came to crush her 
in ravenous jaws. 

She had only imagined the eyes 
upon her. She stretched lazily 
and picked herself up, pausing to 
brush off the leaves of grass 
pasted to her wet skin. It was 
over, the strange warship in the 
rain, and she was weary. She 
walked slowly toward the house. 

Then she heard it — a faint 
crackling sound, intermittent, 
distant. She stood poised in the 
black shadow of the house, listening. The crackle of paper . . . 
then a small pop . . . then crisp 
fragments dropped in the street. 
It was repeated at short intervals. 

Taking nervous, shallow 
breaths, she tiptoed quietly toward the stone wall of the garden. It was six feet high, but 
there was a concrete bench under 
the trellis. The sound was coming from over the wall. She 
stood crouching on the bench; 
then, hiding her face behind the 
vines, she lifted her head to peer. 

The street lamp was half a 



block away, but she could see 
dimly. A man was standing across 
the street in the shadows, apparently waiting for a bus. He 
was eating peanuts out of a paper 
bag. tossing the shells in the 
street. That explained the crackling sound. 

She glared at him balefully 
from behind the trellis. 

'77/ claw 'your eyes our," she 
thought, 'Hi you came and peeped over my wall" 

"Hi!" the man said. 

T ISA stiffened and remained 
motionless. It was impossible 
that he could see her. She was in 
shadow, against a dark background. Had he heard her foolish babbling a moment ago? 

More likely, he had only cleared his throat. 

"Hi!" he said again. 

Her face was hidden in the 
dripping vines, and she could not 
move without rustling. She froze 
in place, staring. She could see 
little of him. Dark raincoat, dark 
hat, slender shadow. Was he 
looking toward her? She was 
desperately frightened. 

Suddenly the man chucked the 
paper bag in the gutter, stepped 
off the curb, and came sauntering across the street toward the 
wall. He removed his hat. and 
crisp blond hair glinted in the 
distant streetlight. He stopped 
three yards away, smiling-uncer

tainly at the vines. 

Lisa stood trembling and frozen, staring at him in horror. 
Strange sensations, utterly alien, 
passed over her in waves. There 
was no describing them, no understanding them. 

"I — I found you," he stammered sheepishly. "Do you know 
what it is?" 

"/ know you," she thought. 
"You have a small scar on the 
back of your neck, and a mole between your toes. Your eyes are 
blue, and you have an impacted 
wisdom tooth, and your feet are 
hurting you because you walked 
all the way out here from the 
University, and Vm almost old 
enough to be your mother. But I 
can't know you, because I've 
neVer seen you before/" 

"Strange, isn't it?" he said uncertainly. He was holding his hat 
in his hand and cocking his head 
politely. 

"What?" she whispered. 

He shuffled his feet and stared 
at them. "It must be some sort 
of palpable biophysical energyform, analytically definable — if 
we had enough data. Lord knows, 
I'm no mystic. If it exists, it's 
got to be mathematically definable. But why us?" 

Horrified curiosity made her 
step aside and lean her arms on 
the wall to stare down at him. 
He looked up bashfully, and his 
eyes widened slightly. 

146 



"Oh!" 

"Oh what?" she demanded, 
putting on a terrible frown. 

"You're beautiful!" 

"What do you want?" she asked icily. "Go away!" 

"I — " He paused and closed his 
mouth slowly. He stared at her 
with narrowed eyes, and touched 
one hand to his temple as if 
concentrating. 

FOR an instant, she was* no 
longer herself. She was looking up at her own shadowy face 
from down in the street, looking 
through the eyes of a stranger 
who was not a stranger. She was 
feeling the fatigue in the weary 
ankles, and the nasal ache of a 
slight head cold, and the strange 
sadness in a curious heart — a 
sadness too akin to her own. 

She rocked dizzily. It was like 
being in two places at once, like 
wearing someone else's body for 
a moment. 

The feeling passed. "It didn't 
happen!" 'she told herself. 

"No use denying it," he said 
quietly. "I tried to make it go 
away, too, but apparently we've 
got something unique. It would 
be interesting to study. Do you 
suppose we're related?" 

"Who are you?" she choked, 
only half-hearing his question. 

"You know my name," he said, 
"if you'll just take the trouble to 
think about it. Yours is Lisa — 


 



Lisa O'Brien, or Lisa Waverly — 
I'm never sure which. Sometimes 
it comes to me one way, sometimes the other." 

She swallowed hard. Her maiden name had been O'Brien. 

"I don't know you," she snapped. 

His name was trying to form 
in her mind. She refused to a^low 
it. The young man sighed. 

"I'm Kenneth Grearly, if you 
really don't know." He stepped 
back a pace and lifted his hat 
toward his head. "I — I guess I 
better go. I see this disturbs you. 
I had hoped we could talk about 
it, , but — well, good night, Mrs. 
Waverly." 

He turned and started away. 

"Wait!" she called out against 
her will. 

He stopped again. "Yes?" 

"Were — were you watching me 
— while it was raining?" 

He opened his mouth and 
stared thoughtfully down the 
street toward the light. "You 
mean watching visually?" You 
really are repressing this thing, 
aren't you? I thought you understood." He looked at her sharply, 
forlornly. "They say the failure 
to communicate is the basis of all 
tragedy. Do you suppose in our 
case . . . ?" 

"What?" 

"Nothing/* He shifted restlessly for a moment. "Good night." 
"Good night," she whispered 



many seconds after he was gone. 

T¥ER bedroom was hot and 
lonely, and she tossed in 
growing restlessness. If only 
Frank were home! But he would 
be gone for two more weeks. The 
children would be back on Monday, but that was three whole 
days away. Crazy! It was just 
stark raving crazy! 

Had the man really existed — 
what was his name ? — Kenneth 
Grearly? Or was he only a phantasm invented by a mind that was 
failing — her mind? Dancing 
# naked in the rain! Calling out to 
shadow shapes in the brush ! 
Talking to a specter in the street! 
Schizophrenic syndrome — dreamworld stuff. It could not be otherwise, for unless she had invented 
Kenneth Grearly, how could she 
know he had sore feet, an impacted wisdom tooth, and a head 
cold. Not only did she know 
about those things, but she felt 
them! 

She buried her face in the dusty 
pillow and sobbed. Tomorrow she 
would have to call Dr. Mensley. 

But fearing the specter's return, she arose a few minutes 
later and locked all the doors in 
the house. When she returned to 
bed, she tried to pray but it was 
as if the prayer were being 
watched. Someone was listening, 
eavesdropping from outside. 

Kenneth Grearly appeared in

her dreams, stood half-shrouded 
in a slowly swirling fog. He stared 
at her with his head cocked aside, 
smiling slightly, holding his hat 
respectfully in his hands. 

"Don't you realize, Mrs. Waverly, that we are mutants perhaps?" he asked politely. 

"No!" she screamed. "I'm happily married and I have three 
children and a place in society! 
Don't come near me!" 

He melted slowly into the fog. 
But echoes came monotonously 
from invisible cliffs: mutant mutant mutant mutant mutant . . . 

Dawn came, splashing pink 
paint across the eastern sky. The 
light woke her to a dry and empty 
consciousness, to a headachy 
awareness full of dull anxiety. 
She arose wearily and trudged to 
the* kitchen for a pot of coffee. 

Lord! Couldn't it all be only a 
bad dream? 

In the cold light of early morning, the things of the past night 
looked somehow detached, unreal. She tried to analyze objectively. 

That sense of sharing a mind, 
a consciousness, with the strariger 
who came out of the shadows — 
what crazy thing had he called 
it? — "some sort of palpable biophysical energy-form, analytically definable." 

"If I invented the stranger," 
she thought, "/ must have also 
invented the words." 



But where had she heard such 
words before? 

T ISA went to the telephone and 
*-* thumbed through the directory. No Grearly was listed. If he 
existed at all, he probably lived 
in a rooming house. The University — last night she had thought 
tha£ he had something to do with 
the University. She lifted the 
phone and dialed. 

"University Station; number 
please," the operator said. 

"I — uh — don't know the extension number. Could you tell me 
if there is a Kenneth Grearly connected with the school?" 

"Student or faculty. Madam?" 

"I don't know." 

"Give me your number, please, 
and I'll call you back." 

"Lawrence 4750. Thanks, Operator." 

She sat down to wait. Almost 
immediately it rang again. 
"Hello?" 

"Mrs. Waverly, you were calling me?" A man's voice. His 
voice! 

"The operator found you rather quickly." It was the only 
thing she could think of saying. 

"No, no. I knew you were calling. In fact, I hoped you into it." 

"Hoped me? Now look here, 
Mr. Grearly, I — " 

"You were trying to explain our 
phenomenon in terms of insanity 
rather than telepathy. I didn't 



148 




 



want you to do that, and so I 
hoped you into calling me." 

Lisa was coldly speechless. 
"What phenomenon are you talking about?" she asked after a few 
dazed seconds. 

"Still repressing it? Listen, I 
can share your mind any time I 
want to, now that I understand 
where and who you are. You 
might as well face the fact. And 
it can work both ways, if you 
let it. Up to now, you've been — 
well, keeping your mind's eye 
* closed, so to speak." 

Her scalp was crawling. The 
whole thing had become intensely 
disgusting to her. 

"I don't know what you're up 
to, Mr. Grearly, but I wish you'd 
stop it. I admit something strange 
is going on, but your explanation 
is ridiculous — offensive, even." 

He was silent for a long time, 
then: "I wonder if the first manape found his prehensile thumb 
ridiculous. I wonder if he thought 
using his hands for grasping was 
offensive." 

"What are you trying to say?" 

"That I think we're mutants. 
We're not the first ones. I had 
this same experience when I was 
in Boston once. There must be 
one of us there, too, but suddenly 
I got the feeling that he had committed suicide. I never saw him. 
We're probably the first ones to 
discover each other." 

"Boston? If what you say is 



true, what would distance have 
to do with it?" 

"Well, if telepathy exists, it 
certainly involves transfer of 
energy from one point to another. 
What kind of energy, I don't 
know. Possibly electromagnetic 
in character. But it seems likely 
that it would obey the inverse 
square law, like radiant energyforms. I came to town about 
three weeks ago. I didn't feel you 
until I got close." 

"There is a connection," she 
thought. She had been wondering 
about the increased anxiety of 
the past three weeks. 

"I don't know what you're 
talking about," she evaded icily, 
though. "I'm no mutant. I don't 
believe in telepathy. I'm not insane. Now let me alone." 

She slammed the telephone in 
its cradle and started to walk 
away. 

Evidently he was angry, for 
she was suddenly communicating 
with him again. 

OHE reeled dizzily and clutched 
^ at the wall, because she was 
in two places at once, and the 
two settings merged in her mind 
to become a blur, like a double 
exposure. She was in her own 
hallway, and she was also in an 
office, looking at a calculator 
keyboard, hearing glassware rattling from across a corridor, 
aware of the smell of foFmalde

bright doorway, but the tracery 
of neural arcs still remained. She 
fought him, but his mind lingered 
in hers. 

". . . perhaps we can get to the 
bottom of it. I know my encephalograph recordings are abnormal, 
and now I can check them against 
hers. A lew correlations will help. 
I'm glad to know about her soft 
fontanel. I wondered about mine. 
Now I think that underneath that 
fontanel lies a pattern of specialized neural — " 

She sagged to the floor of the 
hall and babbled aloud: "Hickory Dickory Dock, the mouse 
ran up the clock. The clock 
struck one — " 

Slowly he withdrew. The laboratory office faded from her 
vision. His thoughts left her. She 
lay there panting for a time. 
Had she won? 

No, there was no sense in claiming victory. She had not driven 
him away. He had withdrawn of 
his own volition when he felt her 
babbling. She knew his withdrawal was free, because she had felt 
his parting state of mind: sad| ness. He had stopped the forced 
contact because he pitied her,

She tried to shut him out. She looking around wildly, touching

her strength and tried to force reassure herself that she was still 

him away. She stared at the in her own home. She staggered

151 



into the parlor and sat shivering 
on the sofa. 

Last night! That crazy running 
around in the -rain! He was responsible for that. He had hoped 
her into doing it, or maybe he 
had just wondered what she 
looked like undressed, and she 
had subconsciously satisfied his 
curiosity. He had planted the 
suggestion — innocently, perhaps 
— and she had unknowingly 
taken the cue. 

He could be with her whenever 
he wanted to! He had been with 
her while she frollicked insanely 
in the rain-sodden grass! Perhaps 
he was with her now. 

Whom could she talk to? 
Where could she seek help? Dr. 
Mensley? He would immediately 
ch»lk it up as a delusion, and 
probably call for a sanity hearing if she wouldn't voluntarily 
enter a psycho-ward for observation. 

The police? "Sergeant. I want 
to report a telepathic prowler. A 
man is burglarizing my mind." 

A clergyman? He would shudder and refer her to a psychiatrist. 

AH roads led to the boobyhatch, it seemed. Frank wouldn't 
believe her. No one would believe 
her. 

T ISA wandered through the 
day like a caged animal. She 
put on her brightest summer 



frock and a pert straw hat and 
went downtown. She wandered 
through the crowds in the business district, window-shopping. 
But she was alone. The herds of 
people about her brushed past 
and wandered on. A man 
whistled at her in front of a cigar 
store. A policeman waved her 
back to the curb when she started across an intersection. 

"Wake up, lady!" he called 
irritably. 

People all about her, but she 
could not tell them, explain to 
them, and so she was alone. She 
caught a taxi and went to visit 
a friend, the wife of an English 
teacher, and drank a glass of iced 
tea in the friend's parlor, and 
talked of small things, and admitted that she was tired when 
the friend suggested that she 
looked that way. When she went 
back home, the Sun was sinking 
in the west. 

She called long distance and 
talked to her mother, then spoke 
to her children, asked them if 
they were ready to come home, 
but they wanted to stay another 
week. They begged, and her 
mother begged, and she reluctantly consented. It had been a 
mistake to call. Now the kids 
would be gone even longer. 

She tried to call Frank in St. 
Louis, but the hotel clerk reported that he had just checked 
out. Lisa knew this meant he was 



152 




 



on the road again. 

"Maybe / ought to go join the 
kids at Mother's," she thought. 
But Frank had wanted her to 
stay home. He was expecting a 
registered letter from Chicago, 
and it was apparently important, 
and she had to take care of it. 

"Vll invite somebody over," 
she thought. But the wives were 
home with their husbands, and it 
was a social mistake to invite a 
couple when her husband was 
gone. It always wound up with 
two women yammering at each 
other while the lone male sat and 
glowered in uneasy isolation, occasionally disagreeing with his 
wife, just to let her know he was 
there and he was annoyed and 
bored and why didn't they go 
home? It was different if the 
business-widow called on a couple. Then the lone male could 
retire to some other part of the 
house to escape the yammering. 

But she decided it wasn't company she wanted; she wanted 
help. And there was no place to 
get it. 

WHEN she allowed her 
thoughts to drift toward 
Kenneth Grearly, it was almost 
like tuning in a radio station. He 
was eating early dinner in the 
University cafeteria with a bedraggled, bespectacled brunette 
from the laboratory. Lisa closed 
her eyes and let herself sift gin


gerly into his thoughts. His attention was on the conversation 
and on the food, and he failed to 
realize Lisa's presence. That 
knowledge gave her courage. 

He was eating Swiss steak and 
hashed brown potatoes, and the 
flavors formed perceptions in her 
mind. She heard the rattle of 
silverware, the low murmur of 
•voices, and smelled the food. She 
marveled at it. The strange ability had apparently been brought 
into focus by learning what it 
was and how to use it. 

"Our work has been too empirical," he was saying. "We've 
studied phenomena, gathered data, looked for correlations. But 
that method has limitations. We 
should try to find a way to approach psychology from below. 
Like the invariantive approach 
to physics."' 

The girl shook her head. 
"The nervous system is too 
complicated for writing theoretical equations about it. Empirical 
equations are the best we can 
do." 

"They aren't good enough, 
Sarah. You can predict results 
with them, inside the limits of 
their accuracy. But you can't extrapolate them very well, and 
they won't stack up together into 
a single integrated structure. And 
when you're investigating a new 
field, they no longer apply. We 
need a broad mathematipal the


COMMAND PERFORMANCE 



153 



ory, covering all hypothetically 
possible neural arrangements. It 
would let us predict not only results, but also predict patterns of 
possible order." 

"Seems to me the possible patterns are infinite." 

"No, Sarah. They're limited 
by the nature of the building 
blocks — neurons, synaptic connections, and, so forth. With 
limited materials, you have structural limitations. You don't 
build skyscrapers out of modeling clay. And there is only a finite 
number of ways you can build 
atoms out of electrons, protons 
and neutrons. Similarly, brains 
are confined to the limitations of 
the things they're made of. We 
need a broad theory for defining 
th^limits." 

"Why?" 

"Because . . ." He paused. Lisa 
felt his urge to explain his urgency, felt him suppress it, felt 
for a moment his loneliness in 
the awareness of his uniqueness 
and the way it isolated him from 
humanity. 

"V^OU must be doing new 
work," the girl offered, "if you 
feel the lack of such a theoretical 
approach. I just can't imagine 
an invariantive approach to psychology — or an all -defining set of 
laws for it, either. Why do you 
need such a psychological 'Relativity'?" 



He hesitated, frowning down at 
his plate, watching a fly crawl 
around its rim. "I'm interested in 
— in the quantitative aspects of 
nerve impulses. I — I suspect that 
there can be such a thing as neural resonance." 

She laughed politely and shook 
her head. "I'll stick to my empirical data - gathering, thank 
you." 

Lisa felt him thinking: 

"She could understand, if I 
could show her data. But my data 
is all subjective, experimental, 
personal. I share it with that 
Waverly woman, but she is only a 
social thinker, analytically shallow, refusing even to recognize 
facts. Why did it have to be her? 
She's flighty, emotional, and in a 
cultural rut. If she doesn't conform, she thinks she's nurs. But 
then at least she's a woman — and 
if this is really a mutation, we'll 
have to arrange for some children . . ." 

Lisa gasped and sat bolt upright. Her shock revealed her 
presence to him, and he dropped 
his fork with a clatter. 

"Lisa.'" 

She wrenched herself free of 
him abruptly. She angrily stalked 
about the house, slamming doors 
and muttering her rage. The 
nerve! The maddening, presumptuous, ill-mannered, self -centered, 
overly educated boor!

deed! An impossible situation! 

As her anger gathered momentum, she contacted him again — 
like a snake striking. Thought 
was thunder out of a dark cloud. 

"I'm decent and Fm respectable, Mr. Grearly! I have a husband and three fine children and 
I love them, and you can go to 
hell! I never want to see you 
again or have you prowling 
around my mind. Get out and 
STAY out. And if you ever bother me again — /'// — Fll kill you." 

He was outdoors, striding 
across the campus alone. She saw 
the gray buildings, immersed in 
twilight, felt the wind on his face, 
hated him. He was thinking nothing, letting himself follow her 
angry flow of thought. When she 
finished, his thoughts began like 
the passionate pleading of a 
poem. 

He was imagining a human 
race with telepathic abilities, in 
near-perfect communication with 
one another. So many of the 
world's troubles could be traced 
to imperfect communication of 
ideas, to misunderstandings. 

Then he thought briefly of 
Sarah — the nondescript laboratory girl he had taken to dinner — 
and Lisa realized he was in love 
with Sarah. There were sadness 
and resentment here. He couldn't 
have Sarah now, not if he were 
to be certain of perpetuating the 
mutant' characteristic. The Wav


erly woman ought to be good for 
three or four children yet, before 
she reached middle age. 

T ISA stood transfixed by shock. 

Then he was thinking directly 
to her. 

"Fm sorry. You're a beautiful, 
intelligent woman — but I dorit 
love you. We're not alike. But I'm 
stuck with you and you're stuck 
with me, because Fve decided it's 
going to be that way. I can't convince you since your thinking 
habits are already fixed, so I 
won't even try. Fm sorry it has 
to be against your will, but in 
any event it has to be. And now 
that I know what you're like, I 
don't dare wait — for fear you'll 
do something to mess things up." 

"No!" she screamed, watching 
the scenery that moved past his 
field of vision. 

He had left the campus and 
was walking up the street — toward her neighborhood. He was 
walking with the briskness of purpose. He was coming to her 
house. 

"Call the police!" she thought, 
and tried to dissolve him out of 
her mind. 

But this time he followed, clung 
to her thoughts, would not let 
her go. It was like two flashlight 
beams playing over a wall, one 
trying to escape, the other following its frantic circle of brightness.

She staggered, groped her way 
toward the hall, which was confused with a superimposed image 
of a sidewalk and a street. A 
phantom automobile came out of 
the hall wall, drove through her 
and vanished. Double exposures. 
He stared at a street light and 
it blinded her. At last she found 
the phone, but he was laughing 
at her. 

"Eight seven six five twentyone Mary had a little lamb seven 
seven sixry-seven yesterday was 
May March April . . ." 

He was deliberately filling her 
mind with confusion. She fumbled at the directory, trying to 
fyid the police, but he thought a 
confused jumble of numbers and 
symbols, and they scampered 
ao*oss the page, blurring the letters. 

She whimpered and groped at 
the phone-dial, trying to get the 
operator, but he was doing something with his fingertips, and she 
couldn't get the feel of the dial. 

On her third try, it finally 
worked. 

"Information," said a pleasant 
impersonal voice. 

She had to get the police! She 
had to say — ; 

"Pease porridge hot, pease porridge cold, pease porridge in the 
pot, nine days pretty polly parrot 
played peacefully plentiwise 
pease porridge . . ." 

He was jamming her speech

centers with gibberish, and she 
blurted nonsense syllables into 
the mouthpiece. 

"You'll have to speak more distinctly, madam. I can't understand you." 

"Poress, Policer . . ." 

"The police? Just a moment." 

A series of jumbled sounds and 
visions clouded her mind. Then a 
masculine voice rumbled, "Desk, 
Sergeant Harris." 

She found a clear path through 
tne confusion and gasped, "Threeoh - oh - three Willow Drive — 
'mergency — come quick — man 
going to — " 

"Three - oh - oh - three Willow. 
Check. We'll have a car right over 
there." 

She hung up quickly — or tried 
to-^but she couldn't find the 
cradle. Then her vision cleared, 
and she screamed. She wasn't in 
the hall at all! 

The telephone was an eggbeater! 




IS voice came through her 
trapped panic. 



"You might as well give in," 
he told her with a note of sadness. 
"I know how to mess you up like 
that, you see. And you haven't 
learned to retaliate yet. We're going to cooperate with this evolutionary trend, whether you like it 
or not — but it would be more 
pleasant if you agree to it." 

"No!" 



"All right, but Vm coming anyway. I hoped it wouldn't be like 
this. I wanted to convince you 
gradually. Now I know that it's 
impossible." 

He was still ten blocks away. 
She had a few minutes in which 
to escape. She bolted for the door. 
A black shadow-shape loomed up 
in the twilight, flung its arms 
wide, and emitted an apelike roar. 

She yelped and darted back, 
fleeing frantically for the front. A 
boa constrictor lay coiled in the 
hall; it slithered toward her. She 
screamed again and raced toward 
the stairway. 

She made it to the top and 
looked back. The living room was 
filling slowly with murky water. 
She rushed shrieking into the 
bedroom and bolted the door. 

She smelled smoke. Her dress 
was on fire! The flames licked up, 
searing her skin. 

She tore at it madly, and got 
it off, but her slip was afire. She 
ripped it away, scooped up the 
flaming clothing on a transom 
hook, opened the screen, and 
dropped them out the window. 
Flames still licked about her, and 
she rolled up in the bed-clothing 
to snuff them out. 

Quiet laughter. 

"New syndrome," he called to 
her pleasantly. "The patient confuses someone else's fantasy with 
her own reality. Not schizophrenia — duophrenia, maybe?"

She lay sobbing in hysterical 
desperation. He was just down 
the street now, coming rapidly 
up the walk. A car whisked slowly 
past. He felt her terrified despair 
and pitied her. The torment 
ceased. 

She stayed there, panting for a 
moment, summoning spirit. He 
was nearing the intersection just 
two blocks south, and she could 
hear the rapid traffic with his 
ears. 

Suddenly she clenched her eyes 
closed and gritted her teeth. He 
was stepping off the curb, walking across — 

She imagined a fire engine 
thundering toward her like a 
juggernaut, rumbling and wailing. 
She imagined another car racing 
out into the intersection, with herself caught in the cross-fire. She 
imagined a woman screaming, 
"Look out, Mister!" 

And then she was caught in 
his own responding fright, and it 
was easier to imagine. He was 
bolting for the other corner. She 
conjured a third car from another 
direction, brought it lunging at 
him to avoid the impending 
wreck. He staggered away from 
the phantom cars and screamed. 

A real car confused the scene. 

She echoed his scream. There 
was a moment of rending pain, 
and then the vision was gone. 
Brakes were still yowling two 
blocks away. Someone was run


ning down the sidewalk. A part of 
her mind had heard the crashing 
thud. She was desperately sick. 

And a sudden sense of complete aloneness told her that 
Grearly was dead. A siren was 
approaching out of the distance. 

VOICES from the sidewalk: 
", . . just threw a fit in the 
middle of the street . . . running 
around like crazy and hollering 
... it was a delivery truck . . . 
crushed his skull . . . nobody else 
hurt . . ." 

After the street returned to 
normal, she arose and went to 
get a drink of water. But she 
stood staring at her sick white 
face in the mirror. There were 
crow's feet forming at the corners 
of her eyes, and her skin was 
growing tired, almost middleaged. 

It was funny that she should 
notice that now, at' this strange 
moment. She had just killed a 
man in self-defense. And no one 
would believe it if she told the 
truth. There was no cause for 
guilt. 

Was there? 
. Frank would be back soon, and 
everything would be the same 
again: peace, security, nice kids, 
nice home, nice husband. Just the 
way it always had been. 

But something was already 
different. An emptiness. A loneliness of the mind that ■ she had

never before felt. She kept looking around to see if the lights 
hadn't gone dim, or the clock 
stopped ticking, or the faucet 
stopped dripping. 

It was none of those things. 
The awful silence was within her. 

Gingerly, she touched the soft 
spot in the top of her head and 
felt an utter aloneness. She closed 
her eyes and thought a hopeless 



plea to the Universe: 

"Is there anybody else like me? 
Can anybody hear me?" 

There was only complete silence, the silence of the voiceless 
void, 

And for the first time in her 
life she felt the confinement of 
total isolation and knew it for 
what it was.
