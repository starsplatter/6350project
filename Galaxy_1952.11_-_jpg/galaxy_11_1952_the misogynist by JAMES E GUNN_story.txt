the misogynist by JAMES E. GUNN 

HARRY is a wit. Someone 
has defined a wit as a 
person who can tell a funny story without cracking a smile. 
That's Harry. 

"You know," Steve said at the 
office one day, "I'll bet Harry will 
walk right up to the flaming gates 
of Hell, keeping the Devil in 



stitches all the time, and never 
change expression." 

That's the kind of fellow Harry 
is. A great guy to have around 
the office. Makes you laugh just 
to see him, thinking about the 
last story he told. Smart, too. 
Keeps at a thing, digging away, 
piling up facts and stuff until 
you finally see something straight 
for the first time. Everybody says 
he's going places. 

But the kind of story Harry 
likes — he likes them long. They 
start kind of slow, you know, 
and sort of build up with a tickle 
here and a tickle there until each 
new touch makes you helpless, 
you're so weak with laughter. The 
kind of story you take home to 
your wife and you get part way 
through, laughing like a fool, and 
you notice she's just sitting there, 
sort of patient and martyred, 
thinking maybe about tomorrow's 
dinner or the dress sale downtown, and you stop laughing and 
sigh and say, "It must be the 
way he tells it" or "Nobody can 
tell stories like Harry." 

But then women don't think 
Harry's funny. 

Take the other night, for instance. Harry and I were sitting 
in his living room while the women — Lucille and Jane — were out 
in the kitchen, whipping up something after the last rubber, and 
Harry started this story. Only at 
first I didn't know it was a story. 

"Did you ever stop to think," 
Harry said, "about what strange 
creatures women really are? The 
way they change, I mean, after 
you marry them. You know, they 
stop hanging on your words, they 
stop catering to your likes and 
dislikes, they stop laughing at 
your jokes." 



I have a minor reputation as 
a humorist myself — oh, nothing 
in Harry's class, but ready with 
quip or pun, if you know what 
I mean. I came in with a laugh 
and said, "So the honeymoon is 
over," Harry and Lucille being 
married only a month or so. 

"Yes," said Harry seriously. 
"Yes, I guess you could say that. 
The honeymoon is over." 

"Tough," I said, feeling sorry 
for the guy. "The girl you marry 
and the woman you're married 
to are two different people." 

"Oh, no," Harry disagreed, 
shaking his head. "They're not. 
That's just the point." 

"The point?" I asked, getting 
an inkling that Harry's thoughtful face hid a purpose not entirely serious. "You mean there 
is a point?" 

"Of course. It's not just a matter of superficial differences, you 
see. It's something fundamental. 
Women think differently, their 
methods are different, their goals 
are different. So different, in fact, 
that they are entirely incomprehensible." 

"I gave up trying to understand 
them a long time ago." 

"That's where we make our 
mistake," Harry said soberly. 
"We accept when we should try 
to understand. We must understand why. As the Scotch say, 
'All are good lasses, but where 
come the ill wives?' "

"Why?" I wanted to know, a 
little puzzled. "They're built differently, and not just outside. 
Glands, bearing children — all 
kinds of differences." 

"That's their excuse," said 
Harry, sneering, "and it's not 
good enough. They should do best 
what their differences best fit 
them for. But their greatest career is marriage — and their greatest failure. A man to them is only 
the necessary evil they must have 
before they can get the other 
things they want." 

"Like the black widow spider 
and her mate?" I suggested. 

"In a way. And yet not entirely. The spiders, at least, are 
of the same species." 

I nodded over that for a moment before it soaked in. "And 
men and women aren't?" I practically yelled. 

"Sh!" he warned, and glanced 
nervously at the kitchen door. 

*T^HEN was when I began to 
chuckle. Harry should have 
been in the movies. And yet I 
had to admire the guy, making 
a joke out of what is — every husband can tell you — one of the 
greatest and most secret tragedies 
of life, greater even because no 
one can talk about it. No one but 
Harry. 

My chuckle must have been the 
right response, because he nodded, relaxed, and stopped glanc


ing at the door out of the corner 
of his eye. Or maybe that was 
after Lucille peeked around the 
corner and said, "Harry off on 
one of his stories again? Tell us 
when he's through, so we can 
bring in the refreshments." 

She was pretty light about it 
and you could tell it was a running joke and I couldn't help 
thinking what a lucky guy Harry 
was — if a fellow has to get married, that is, and most of us do. 

"The alien race," Harry whispered and leaned back. 

It was a good line and I laughed; there wasn't anything forced 
about it, either. 

"What better way," he continued, "to conquer a race than 
to breed it out of existence? The 
Chinese learned that a long time 
ago. Conqueror after conqueror 
took the country and each one 
was passively accepted, allowed 
to intermarry . . . and eventually 
was absorbed. Only this case is 
the reverse. Conquest by marriage 
might be a good term for it. Breed 
in the conqueror, breed out the 
slave. Breed in the alien, breed 
out the human." 

I nodded appreciatively. 
"Makes sense." 

"How did it all start?" asked 
Harry. "And when? If I knew 
those answers, I'd know the whole 
thing. All I've got is a theory. 
An alien race of women landed 
on Earth — when man was still a

cave-dwelling animal, maybe, or 
it could even have been in historic times — and my guess is they 
were dropped here by their men. 
Jettisoned. Dumped. Why? To 
get rid of them, obviously." 

"But what did their men do 
then?" I had to ask, feeding him 
the next point. 

"How do I know?" he replied 
irritably. "They were aliens, remember. Maybe they had some 
solution, some procreative substitute for women. Maybe these 
women were just the worst of 
the lot and the remaining ones 
were better. Maybe the men 
didn't give a damn and preferred 
racial suicide to surrender." 

He angrily shoved the coffee 
table aside, grumbling something 
abouj: women's ideas of furnishing a home, and pulled his chair 
closer. "Sure, surrender. They 
couldn't exterminate the men, 
could they? Who has the weapons, the military knowledge? 
Besides, women don't think like 
that. Their minds work in devious ways; they win what they 
want by guile and subtlety. 
That's why they married into 
the human race." 

I looked blank, which is always a good way to push him on. 

"Well, look," he said earnestly, 
just as I figured he would, "how 
about the Amazons? Once a year, 
you know, they visited the Gargareans, a neighboring tribe; any 



resulting male children were put 
to death. That didn't work very 
long, of course. Their purpose 
and their very alienness were too 
obvious. And the matriarchies — 
too blatant, you see, might give 
the whole thing away. Besides, 
men are useful in ways that women aren't. Men are inventive, 
artistic, creative — and can be 
nagged or coaxed into doing what 
women want them to do." 

1LIT a cigarette and looked for 
an ashtray to put the match. 
He shoved over some silly little 
object that would suffocate a 
cigarette the minute you laid it 
down. No grooves, either, of 
course. 

"That's what women buy when 
they're on their own," he pointed 
out disgustedly. "Lights that they 
think look pretty and make you 
blind or put a crick in your back 
when you try to read. You get 
a house with a southern exposure 
so you'll have sunlight, ■a'nd then 
they put up heavy drapes to keep 
the furniture from fading. That's 
not enough, so they dress the furniture in slipcovers that always 
get twisted and creased. They 
* shed bobbypins like dandruff, 
hang stockings over towels to 
dry, never screw a cap on a bottle 
or jar, so it always falls and 
breaks when" you pick it up by 
the top, 'straighten up the house,' 
as they call it, by shoving every

thing into drawers where you 
never can find what you want." 

I dug an uncomfortable cushion out from behind me and 
threw it on another chair. "All 
of them?" I asked. "Are they 
all alike?" 

"I've wondered about that," he 
admitted, frowning. "There must 
be some human women left. One 
hears about happy marriages, although that might just be female 
propaganda. The women who like 
to read and use their minds, I'd 
say. Those who aren't so damned 
practical that they'd get up off 
their deathbeds to straighten a 
crooked picture. Women who can 
grasp abstract ideas. I don't think 
the — the aliens can." He looked 
up, brightening. "Those could be 
tests for alienness. That .is," he 
added, frowning again, "if I'm 
right and there actually are any 
human women." 

"How about those," I chipped 
in, "who prefer men and dislike 
other women?" 

He thought that over seriously. 
"Most other women. It could be 
that they sense the aliens better 
than we can and don't want anything to do with them. Yes, that 
would — no, the aliens probably 
stick together, so that's out as 
a test." 

"There are women who are satisfied with just a comfortable 
life," I suggested. "Those who 
don't drive their husbands to so 



much insurance that they're 
worth more dead than alive and 
then work them to death. That 
sounds pretty human to me." 

Harry shrugged helplessly. "I 
guess so, but we'll never really 
know the answers. Or, if we do, 
it'll be too late." 

"Too late?" 

"Well, certainly," he said, tapping me on the knee. That's my 
ticklish spot and I was having 
enough trouble not laughing. "It's 
only in the last few generations 
that their plans have been coming 
closer to success. They have the 
vote, equal rights without giving 
up any of their privileges, and 
so forth. They're outliving men— 
and it's men, of course, who are 
extending the life span for them. 
They control about ninety per 
cent of the wealth. And there's 
something else men are doing for 
them." His voice sank to a significant whisper. "We're experimenting with fertilization by salt 
water, electrical stimulus, that 
sort of thing. Once we work it out 
properly ..." 

"We won't be needed any 
more," I spluttered. 

"That's right," he agreed gravely. "They'll just refuse to marry, 
use prenatal sex determination 
to produce nothing but girls, and 
then you'll have a single race — 
the female race. That's what I 
think they want." 

"It figures," I answered, trying

to crush out my cigarette in the 
ridiculous tray. 

He nodded. "Don't think I 
haven't got more than vague suspicions. And it's been damned 
hard; knowledge of the female 
conspiracy has died out in the 
last fifty years or so. There's no 
longer even that subconscious 
knowledge that alerted the centuries of men before — that body 
of tradition and folklore which 
- is a sort of inherited wisdom of 
a people. We've been taught to 
scorn all that as superstition. 
Most teachers are women, of 
course." 

"Before our time, men knew?" 
I gave him his straight line. 

"Oh, yes," Harry said. "Homer. 
Ovid, Swift — 'A dead wife under 
the table is the best goods in a 
mari*s house,* said Swift. Antiphanes, Menander. Cato — there 
was a wise one. 'Suffer women 
once to arrive at an equality with 
you, and they will from that moment become your superiors.' 
Plautus, Clement of Alexandria, 
Tasso, Shakespeare, Dekker, 
Fletcher, Thomas Browne — the 
list is endless. The Bible: 'How 
can he be clean that is born of 
woman?'; 'All wickedness is but 
little to the wickedness of a woman'; 'I suffer not a woman to 
teach, nor to usurp authority over 
the man, but to be in silence'. . ." 

For fifteen minutes he continued, covering the Greeks, the 



Romans, the Renaissance, and 
hadn't begun to run dry. Even 
for Harry this' was digging deep 
for a story. This is Harry's peak, 
I said to myself, a little awed. 
He will never do anything better 
than this. 

f T^HEN Harry began getting 
closer to modern times. 
" 'Women are much more like 
each other than men,' said Lord 
Chesterfield. And Nietzsche : 
'Thou goest to women? Don't forget thy whip.' Then there was 
Strindberg, touched by a divine 
madness which gave him visions 
of hidden truths. Shaw concealed 
his suspicions in laughter lest he 
be torn to pieces — " 

"Ibsen?" I suggested, chuckling, dredging a name out of my 
school days that I vaguely remembered was somehow connected with the subject. 

Harry spat, as if he had something vile in his mouth. 

"Ibsen! That traitor! That 
blind fool! It was he who first 
dramatized the insidious propaganda which led, eventually, to 
the so-called emancipation of 
women, and was really the loosing of the chains which kept them 
from ravening unrestrained." 

"Ravening," I chortled. "That's 
the word, all right — ravening!" 

"You must go back to folk 
sayings to get real truth," Harry 
went on, quieting a little. " 'A 



116 



G-A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



man is happy only two times 
in his life,' say the Jugoslavs, 
'when he marries a wife and when 
he buries her.' Or the Rumanians : 
'When a man takes a wife, he 
ceases to dread Hell.' Or the 
Spanish : 'Who hath a wife hath 
also an enemy.' 'Never believe a 
woman, not even a dead one,' advise the German peasants. The 
wisdom of the Chinese: 'Never 
trust a woman, even though she 
has given you ten sons'." 

He stopped, not as if he were 
near the end of his material, but 
to begin brooding. 

"Did you ever look for something," he asked, "a collar button, say, or a particular pair of 
socks — and it isn't there and you 
tell your wife? Why is it that 
she can come and pick it up and 
it's been right under your nose 
all the time?" 

"What else have they got to 
think about?" 

"It makes you wonder," he insisted. "It makes you wonder if 
it really was there when you 
looked." 

I agreed with him, and thought, 
Strange, the odd truths that Harry can link into something excrutiatingly funny. 

"They have no respect for 
logic," said Harry. "No respect 
at all for the sanctity of a man's 
mind, for what his world is built 
upon. They argue as it suits them, 
waving away contradictions and 



inconsistencies as meaningless. 
How many of us have our Xanthippes, bent on dragging us down 
from our contemplation of divine 
truth to the destructive turmoil of 
daily strife? It's maddening, maddening!" 

A thought struck me. So far, 
Harry had a number of strings, 
amusing in themselves, but lacking the climax that would wind 
them all up into a neat ball of 
laughter. 

"What would they do," I asked, 
smiling, "if they discovered that 
someone knew their secret? They 
couldn't let it get around, could 
they?" 

Harry smiled in return. For one 
unwary second, I thought he was 
slipping, giving the joke away. 

"There," said Harry, "you have 
hit upon the crux. If my snrmises 
are true, why has no one else 
discovered it? And the answer is 
— they have I" 

"They have ?" I repeated , a 
little surprised. 

"Oh, yes," Harry answered, 
nodding. "And it provides the 
clincher. The women would have 
to do away with them, of course. 
Silence them. And it would have 
to show up somewhere — if one 
knew where to look." 

"Yes?" I prompted, breathlessly. 

"Why," he said, pointing a 
finger at me, "are there more 
men in asylums than women?"

"You mean — ?" 
He nodded. 

I collapsed, hysterical. I choked 
with laughter. It was only with 
difficulty that I was able to speak 
when the women came in a moment later with their bowls and 
potato chips and glasses of beer. 

"Hi, alien," I spluttered at 
Jane. 

And I laughed some more, especially when I looked at Harry 
and saw the stricken face he was 
putting on, horrified, terribly 
frightened, sort of all sunk in on 
himself — better, much better, than 
I've seen a professional actor do 
it on the screen. 

Finally the look on the women's faces brought me around — 
the bored look — and I tried to 
share the joke. Harry was laughing, too, kind of weakly- — surprising, because he always is sort of 
bland and mildly curious when 
one of his stories gets everybody 
writhing. 

So I started telling it and got 
part way through and — well, you 
know the way it ends. I looked at 
Harry for help, but he wasn't 
giving any, and I kind of died 
away slowly. 

"It must be the way he tells 
it," I sighed. "Nobody can tell 
stories like Harry." 

You see what I mean. Women 
don't think Harry's funny. 

The evening turned out all 
right, though. A little flat at the 



end, the way evenings usually are. 

As we were going out, I heard 
Lucille say, kind of sharp, "Harry, there's something wrong with 
the hot water heater. You've been 
promising to look at it for days, 
and you've just got to do something about it tonight because I'm 
going to be washing tomorrow," 
and I heard Harry answer, "Yes, 
dear," mild and obedient, and 
I thought, The guy's got to blow 
off steam somewhere, and figured 
that I'd be hearing the story 
again at the office. 

Which goes to show how wrong 
a man can be. 

NEXT morning, Lucille called 
up and said Harry was sick — 
a stroke or a heart attack or 
something — and couldn't come to 
work. I called there a couple of 
times, but Lucille told me he was 
too sick to see anybody. I knew 
Harry was really sick because 
Lucille had Dr. Clarke, that woman doctor, and Harry's said he 
wouldn't have her treat his sick 
dog if he wanted the dog to get 
well. So I knew Harry was too 
sick to care. 

It's funny how quick a fellow 
can go, and I got to thinking what 
a shame it was that Harry's finest 
effort, the climax of his wit, so 
to speak, should go with him, and 
how it's too bad that great vocal 
art should vanish without leaving, 
a trace. 



THE MISOGYNIST 



So I began trying to remember 
— and I couldn't remember very 
good, particularly the quotations 
— so I did a little research of my 
own, just to be able to give a 
sample. I ran across a couple 
Harry missed. 

One of them everybody knows. 
The one of Kipling's that begins, 
"The female of the species ..." 
The other one I worked up by 
myself, just thinking. Why, I asked myself one day, are there more 
widows than widowers? Of 
course, I couldn't think of an 
answer. 

It's a shame about Harry. A 
great guy like that, a humorist 
who never was given the chance to 
share his gift with the world — 
if you ask me, funnier than anybody on radio or TV or the stage ; 
anywhere, for that matter — and 
here he is getting set to kick off. 
The least I can do is reconstruct 
this biggest gag he ever put together as a kind of monument 
to him. 

Well, it's finished. I'll show it 
to the boys in the office tomorrow. 
They'll get a real kick out of it. 
No sense showing it to the girls, 
even Jane — like I said, women 
never thought Harry was funny. 

Something else he left out, but 
probably only because he didn't 
have enough time to develop the 
gag the way he usually does. 
What kind of planet did the 
aliens come from? It must have 



a lot of carbon dioxide. Ever 
notice how women always complain when you open a window? 
It must be a hot world, too; 
they're cold all the time, especially their feet, which they like 
to put against their husband's 
legs, making the poor guy practically leap out of bed. I'm an 
expert on that — Jane's toes would 
chill any highball. But their 
world can't be that hot, because 
women can trot around in the 
coldest weather with practically 
nothing underneath their coats. 
And how about those open-toe 
shoes? 

It doesn't add up at all. I 
suppose Harry would shrug it off 
as another proof of their alienness. Possibly he'd say it was just 
outside that women were warm; 
it's in the house that they're cold. 

Well, there you are — Jane is 
calling me to come down to the 
cellar and fix the furnace. There 
isn't a thing wrong with it. I'm 
sweating, as a matter of fact. But 
if I don't go down and monkey 
around with the grate and draft, 
I'll never hear the end of it. And 
I'd better go just to save the furnace; Jane's banging it with a 
poker, yelling up to me that she'll 
fix it if I don't. 

Jane with a poker; there's a 
laugh for you. She can't even 
wind a clock without breaking 
the mainspring.
