The Martian Way by ISAAC ASIMOV

FROM the doorway of the 
short corridor between the 
only two rooms in the 
travel-head of the spaceship, 
Mario Esteban Rjoz watched 
sourly as Ted Long adjusted the 
vTdeo dials painstakingly. Long 
tried a touch clockwise, then a 
touch counter. The picture was 
lousy. 

Rioz knew it would stay lousy. 
They were too far from Earth 
and at a bad position facing the 
Sun. But then Long would not be 
expected to know that. Rioz re


mained standing in the doorway 
for an additional moment, head 
bent to clear the upper lintel, 
body turned half sidewise to fit 
the narrow opening. Then he 
jerked into the galley like a cork 
popping out of a bottle. 

''What are you after?" he asked. 

"I thought I'd get Hilder," said 
Long. 

Rioz propped his rump on the 
corner of a table-shelf. He lifted 
a conical can of milk from the 
companion shelf just above his 
head. Its point popped under 
pressure. He swirled it gently as

he waited for it to warm. 

"What for?" he said. He upended the cone and sucked noisily. 

"Thought I'd listen." 

"I think it's a waste of power." 

Long looked up, frowning. "It's 
customary to allow free use of 
personal video sets." 

"Within reason," retorted Rioz. 

THEIR eyes met challengingly. 
Rioz had the rangy body, the 
gaunt, cheek -sunken face that 
was almost the hallmark of the 
Martian Scavenger, those Spacers 
who patiently haunted the space 
routes between Earth and Mars. 
Pale blue eyes were set keenly 
in the brown, lined face which, 
in turn, stood darkly out against 
thg white, surrounding syntho-fur 
that lined the upturned collar of 
his leathtic space-jacket. 

Long was altogether paler and 
softer. He bore some of the marks 
of the Grounder, although no 
second -generation Martian could 
be a Grounder in the sense that 
Earthmen were. His own collar 
was thrown back and his dark 
brown hair freely exposed. 
1 "What do you call within reason?" demanded Long. 

Rioz's thin lips grew thinner. 
He said, "Considering that we're 
not even going to make expenses 
this trip, the way it looks, any 
power drain at all is outside reason." 



Long said, "If we're losing 
money, hadn't you better get 
back to your post? It's your 
watch." 

Rioz grunted and ran a thumb 
and forefinger over the stubble 
on his chin. He got up and 
trudged to the door, his soft, 
heavy boots muting the sound of 
his steps. He paused to look at 
the thermostat, then turned with 
a flare of fury. 

"I thought it was hot. Where 
do you think you are?" 

Long said, "Forty degrees isn't 
excessive." 

"For you it isn't, maybe. But 
this is space, not a heated office 
at the iron mines." Rioz swung 
the thermostat control down to 
minimum with a quick thumb 
movement. "Sun's warm enough." 

"The galley isn't on Sunside." 

"It'll percolate through, damn 
it." 

Rioz stepped through the door 
and Long stared after him for 
a long moment, then turned back 
to the video. He did not turn 
up the thermostat. 

The picture was still flickering 
badly, but it would have to do. 
Long folded a chair down out 
the wall. He leaned forward 
waiting through the formal announcement, the momentary 
pause before the slow dissolution 
of the curtain, the spotlight picking out the well-known bearded 
figure which grew as it was

brought forward until it filled the 
screen. 

The voice, impressive even 
through the Outings and croakings induced by the electron 
storms of twenty millions of 
miles, began : 

"Friends! My fellow-citizens of 
Earth — " 

II 

TJIOZ'S eye caught the flash of 
the radio signal as he stepped 
into the pilot room. For one 
moment the palms of his hands 
grew clammy when it seemed to 
him that it was a radar pip; but 
that was only his guilt speaking. 
He should not have left the pilot 
room while on duty, theoretically, 
though all Scavengers did it. Still, 
it was the standard nightmare, 
this business of a strike turning 
up during just those five minutes 
when one knocked off for a quick 
coffee because it seemed certain 
that space was clear. And the 
nightmare had been known to 
happen, too. 

Rioz threw in the multi-scanner. It was a waste of power, but 
while he was' thinking about it. 
he might as well make sure. 

Space was clear except for the 
far distant echoes from the neighboring ships on the scavenging 
line. 

He hooked up the radio circuit, 
and the blond, long-nosed head 



of Richard Swenson, co-pilot of 
the next ship on the Marsward 
side, filled it. 

"Hey, Mario," said Swenson. 

"Hi. What's new?" 

There was a second and a fraction of pause between that and 
Swenson 's next comment, since 
the speed of electromagnetic radiation is not infinite. 

"What a day I've had." 

"Something happened ?" Rioz 
asked. 

"I had a strike." 

"Well, good." 

"Sure, if I'd roped it in," said 
Swenson morosely. 

"What happened?" 

"Damn it, I headed in the 
wrong direction." 

Rioz knew better than to laugh. 
He said, "How did you do that?" 

"It wasn't my fault. The 
trouble was the shell was moving 
way out of the ecliptic. Can you 
imagine the stupidity of a pilot 
that can't work the release maneuver decently? How was I to 
know? I got the distance of the 
shell and let it go at that. I 
just assumed its orbit was in 
the usual trajectory family. 
Wouldn't you? I started along 
what I thought was a good line 
of intersection and it was five 
minutes before I noticed the 'distance was still going up. The pips 
were taking their sweet time returning. So then I took the angular projections of the thing, and it

was too late to catch up with it." 

"Any of the other boys getting 
it?" 

"No. It's way out of the ecliptic 
and'll keep on going forever. 
That's not what bothers me so 
much. It was only an inner shell. 
But I hate to tell you how many 
tons of propulsion I wasted getting up speed and then getting 
back to station. You should have 
heard Canute." 

Canute was Richard Swenson's 
brother and partner. 

"Mad, huh?" said Rioz. 

"Mad? Like to have killed me! 
But then we've been out five 
months now and it's getting kind 
of sticky. You know." 

"I know." 

"How are you doing, Mario?" 

Rioz made a spitting gesture. 
"ASbut that much this trip. Two 
shells in the last two weeks and 
I had to chase each one for six 
hours." 

"Big ones?" 

"Are you kidding? I could have 
scaled them down to Phobos by 
hand. This is the worst trip I've 
ever had." 

"How much longer are you 
staying?" 

"For my. part, we can quit tomorrow. We've only been out two 
months and it's got so I'm chewing Long out all the time." 

There was a pause over and 
above the electromagnetic lag. 

Swenson said, "What's he like. 



anyway? Long, I mean." 

Rioz looked over his shoulder. 
He could hear the soft, crackly 
mutter of the video in the galley. 
"I can't make him out. He says 
to me about a week after the start 
of the trip, 'Mario, why are you 
a Scavenger?' I just look at him 
and say, 'To make a living. Why 
do you suppose?' I mean, what 
the hell kind of a question is 
that? Why is anyone a Scavenger? 

"Anyway, he says, 'That's not 
it, Mario.' He's telling me, you 
see. He says, 'You're a Scavenger 
because this is part of the Martian way.' " 

Swenson said, "And what did 
he mean by that?" 

Rioz shrugged. "I never asked 
him. Right now he's sitting in 
there listening to the ultra-microwave from Earth. He's listening 
to some Grounder called Hilder." 

"Hilder? A Grounder politician, an Assemblyman or something, isn't he?" • 

"That's right. At least, I think 
that's right. Long is always doing 
things like that. He brought about 
fifteen pounds of books with him, 
all about Earth. Just plain dead 
weight, you know." 

"Well, he's your parfltxer. And 
talking about partners, I think I'll 
get back on the job. If I iniss 
another strike, there'll be murder 
around here." 

He was gone and Rioz leaned 



8 



GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTION 



back. He watched the even green 
line that was the pulse-scanner. 
He tried the multi-scanner a 
moment. Space was still clear. 

TIE felt a little better. A bad 
-"■spell is always worse if the 
Scavengers all about you are pulling in shell after shell; if the shells 
go spiraling down to the Phobos 
scrap - forges with everyone's 
brand welded on except your 
own. Then, too, he had managed 
to work off some of his resentment toward Long. 

It was a mistake, teaming up 
with Long. It was always a mistake to team up with a tenderfoot. 
They thought what you wanted 
was conversation, especially Long, 
with his eternal theories about 
Mars and its great new role in 
human progress. That was the 
way he said it- — Human Progress; 
the Martian Way; the New Creative Minority. And all the time 
what Rio2 wanted wasn't talk, 
but a strike, a few shells to call 
their own. 

At that, he hadn't any choice, 
really. Long was pretty well 
known down on Mars and made 
good pay as a mining engineer. 
He was a friend of Commissioner 
Sankov and he'd been out on 
one or two short scavenging missions before. You can't turn a fellow down flat before a tryout . 
even though it did look funny. 
Why shpuld a mining engineer 



with a comfortable job and good 
money want to muck around in 
space? 

Rioz never asked Long that 
question. Scavenger partners are 
forced too closely together to 
make curiosity desirable, or 
sometimes even safe. But Long 
talked so much that he answered 
the question. 

"I had to come out here. Mario," he said. "The future of Mars 
isn't in the mines; it's in space." 

Rioz wondered how it would 
be to try a trip alone. Everyone 
said it was impossible. Even discounting lost opportunities when 
one man had to go off watch to 
sleep or attend to other things, 
it was well known that one man 
alone in space would become intolerably depressed in a relatively 
short while. 

Taking a partner along made a 
six-month trip possible. A regular 
crew would be better, but no 
Scavenger could make money on 
a ship large enough to carry one. 
The capital it would take in propulsion alone! 

Even two didn't find it exactly 
fun in space. Usually, you had to 
change partners each trip and 
you could stay out longer with 
some than with others. Look at 
Richard and Canute Swenson. 
They teamed up every five or 
six trips because they were brothers. And yet whenever they did. 
it was a case of constantly mount

ing tension and antagonism after 
the first week. 

Oh, well. Space was clear. Rioz 
would feel a little better if he 
went back in the galley and 
smoothed down some of the bickering with Long. He might as 
well show he was an old spacehand who took the irritations of 
space as they came. 

He stood up, walked the three 
steps necessary to reach the short, 
narrow corridor that tied together 
the two rooms of the spaceship. 

Ill 

ONCE again, Rioz stood in the 
doorway for a moment, 
watching. Long was intent on the 
flickering screen. 

Jiioz said, gruffly, "I'm shoving 
up the thermostat. It's all right — 
we can spare the power." 
Long nodded. "If you like." 
Rioz took a hesitant step forward. Space was clear, so to hell 
with sitting and looking at a 
blank, green, pipless line. He said, 
"What's the Grounder been talking about?" 

"History of space travel, mostly. Old stuff, but he's doing it 
well. He's giving the whole works 
— color cartoons, trick photography, stills from old films, everything." 

As if to illustrate Long's remarks, the bearded figure faded 
out of view, and a cross- sectional 



view of a spaceship flitted onto 
the screen. Hilder's voice continued, pointing out features of 
interest that appeared in schematic color. The communications 
system of the ship outlined itself 
iri red as he talked about it, the 
storerooms, the proton micro-pile 
drive, the cybernetic circuits — 

Then Hilder was back on the 
screen. "But this is only the 
travel-head of the ship. What 
moves it? What gets it off the 
Earth?" 

Everyone knew what moved a 
spaceship, but Hilder's voice was 
like a drug. He made spaceship 
propulsion sound like the secret 
of the ages, like an ultimate revelation. Even Rioz felt a slight 
-tingling of suspense, though he 
had spent the greater part of his 
life aboard ship. 

Hilder went on. "Scientists call 
it different names. They call it the 
Law of Action and Reaction. 
Sometimes they call it Newton's 
Third Law. Sometimes they call 
it Conservation of Momentum. 
But we don't have to call it any 
name. We can just use our common sense. When we swim, we 
push water backward and move 
forward ourselves. When we walk, 
we push back against the ground 
and move forward. When we fly a 
gyro-flivver, we push air backward and move forward. 

"Nothing can move forward 
unless something else moves 




 



backward. It's the old principle of 
'You can't get something for 
nothing.' 

"Now imagine a spaceship that 
weighs a hundred thousand tons 
lifting off Earth. To do that, 
something else must be moved 
downward. Since a spaceship is 
extremely heavy, a great deal of 
material must b. moved downward- So much material, in fact, 
that there is no place to keep it 
all aboard ship. A special compartment must be built behind 
the ship to hold it." 

Again Hilder faded out and the 
ship returned. It shrank and a 
truncated cone appeared behind 
it. In bright yellow, words appeared within it: material to be 

THROWN AWAY. 

"But now," said Hilder, "the 
total weight of the ship is much 
greater. You need still more propulsion and still more." 

The ship shrank enormously to 
add on another larger shell and 
still another immense one. The 
ship proper, the travel-head, was 
a little dot on the screen, a glowing red dot. 

Rioz said, "Hell, this is kindergarten stuff." 

"Not to the people he's speaking to, Mario," replied Long. 
"Earth isn't Mars. There must be 
billions of Earth people who've 
never even seen a spaceship; don't 
know the first thing about it." 

Hilder was saying, "When the 



material inside the biggest shell 
is used up, the shell is detached. 
It's thrown away, too." 

The outermost shell came 
loose, wobbled about the screen. 

"Then the second one goes," 
said Hilder, "and then, if the 
trip is a long one, the last is 
ejected." 

The ship was just a red dot 
now, with three shells shifting 
and moving, lost in space. 

Hilder said, "These shells represent a hundred thousand tons 
of tungsten, magnesium, aluminum, and steel. They are gone 
forever from Earth. Mars is ringed by scavengers, waiting along 
the routes of space travel, waiting for the cast-off shells, netting 
and branding them, saving them 
for Mars. Not one cent of payment reaches Earth for them. 
They are salvage. They belong 
to the ship that finds them." 

RIOZ said, "We risk our investment and our lives. If we 
don't pick them up, no one gets 
them. What loss is that to 
Earth?" 

"Look," said Long, "he's been 
talking about nothing but the 
drain that Mars, Venus and the 
Moon put on Earth. This is just 
another item of loss." 

''They'll get their return. We're 
mining more iron every year." 

"And most of it goes right back 
into Mars. If you can believe 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



11 



his figures. Earth has invested 
two hundred billion dollars in 
Mars and received back about 
five billion dollars worth of iron. 
It's put five hundred billion dollars into the Moon and gotten 
back a little over twenty-five billion dollars of magnesium, titanium and assorted light metals. It's 
put fifty billion dollars into Venus 
and gotten back nothing. And 
that's what the taxpayers of 
Earth are really interested in — 
tax money out; nothing in." 

The screen was filled, as he 
spoke, with diagrams of the scavengers on the route to Mars; 
little, grinning caricatures of 
ships, reaching out wiry, tenuous 
arms that groped for the tumbling, empty shells, seizing and 
snaking them in, branding them 
mars property in glowing letters, 
then scaling them down to Phobos. 

Then it was Hilder again. 
"They tell us eventually they will 
return it all to us. Eventually! 
Once they are a going concern! 
We don't know when that will be. 
A century from now? A thousand 
years? A million? 'Eventually.' 
Let's take them at their word. 
Some day they will give us back 
all our metals. Some day they 
will grow their own food, use their 
own power, live their own lives. 

"But one thing they can never 
return. Not in a hundred million 
years. Water! 



"Mars has only a trickle of 
water because it is too small. 
Venus has no water at all because 
it is too hot. The Moon has none 
because it is too hot and too 
small. So Earth must supply not 
only drinking water and washing 
water for the Spacers, water to 
run their industries, water for the 
hydroponic factories they claim 
to be setting up — but even water 
to throw away by the millions of 
tons. 

"What is the propulsive force 
that spaceships use? What is it 
they throw out behind so that 
they can accelerate forward? Once 
it was the gases generated from 
explosives. That was very expensive. Then the proton micropile was invented — a cheap power 
source that could heat up any 
liquid until it was a gas under 
tremendous pressure. What is the 
cheapest and most plentiful liquid 
available? Why, water, of course. 

"Each spaceship leaves Earth 
carrying nearly a million tons — 
not pounds, rons — of water, for 
the sole purpose of driving it into 
space so that it may speed up or 
slow down. 

"Our ancestors burned the oil 
of Earth madly and wilfully. 
They destroyed its coal recklessly. Wc despise and condemn 
them for that, but at least they 
had this excuse — they thought 
that when the need arose, substitutes would be found. And they 




 



were right. We have our plankton 
farms and our proton micro-piles. 

"But there is no substitute for 
water. None! There never can be. 
And when our descendants view 
the desert we will have made of 
Earth, what excuse will they find 
for us? When the droughts come 
and grow — " 

T ONG leaned forward and 
turned off the set. He said, 
"That bothers me. The damn fool 
is deliberately — What's the matter?" 

Rioz had risen uneasily to his 
feet. "I ought to be watching the 
pips." 

"The hell with the pips." Long 
got up likewise, followed Rioz 
through the narrow corridor and 
stood just inside the pilot room. 
"If Hilder carries this through, 
if he's got the guts to make a real 
issue out of it — Wow.'" 

He had seen it, too. The pip 
was a Class A. racing after the 
outgoing signal like a greyhound 
after a mechanical rabbit. 

Rioz was babbling, "Space was 
clear, I tell you. clear. For Mars' 
sake. Ted, don't just freeze on 
me. See if you can spot it visually." 

Rioz was working speedily and 
with an efficiency that was the 
result of nearly twenty years of 
scavenging. He had the distance 
in two minutes. Then, remembering Swt nson's experience, he mea


sured the angle of declination and 
the radial velocity as well. 

He yelled at Long, "One point 
seven six radians. You can't miss 
it. man." 

Long held his breath as he adjusted the vernier. "It's only half 
a radian off the Sun. It'll only 
be crescent-lit." 

He increased magnification as 
rapidly as he dared, watching for 
the one "star" that changed position and grew to have a form, 
revealing itself to be no star. 

"I'm starting, anyway," said 
Rioz. "We can't wait." 

"I've got it. I've got it." Magnification was still too small to 
give it a definite shape, but the 
dot Long watched was brightening and dimming rhythmically, 
as the shell rotated and caught 
sunlight on cross-sections of cyclically different sizes. 

"Hold on." 

The first of many fine spurts 
of steam squirted out of the 
proper vents, leaving long trails 
of micro-crystals of ice, gleaming 
mistily in the pale beams of the 
distant Sun. They thinned out 
for a hundred miles or more. One 
spurt, then another, then another, 
as the Scavenger ship moved out 
of its stable trajectory and took 
up a course tangential to that of 
the shell. 

"It's moving like a comet at 
perihelion!" yelled Rioz. "Those 
damned Grounder pilots knock 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



13 



the shells off that way on purpose. 
I'd like to — " 

He swore his anger in a frustrated frenzy as he kicked steam 
backward and backward recklessly, till the hydraulic cushioning 
of his chair had soughed back a 
full foot and Long had found 
himself all but unable to maintain his grip on the guard rail. 

"Have a heart," he begged. 

But Rioz had his eye on the 
pips. "If you can't take it, man. 
stay on Mars!" The steam spurts 
continued to boom distantly. 

The radio came to life. Long 
managed to lean forward through 
what seemed like molasses and 
closed contact. It was Swenson. 
eyes glaring. 

Swenson yelled, "Where the 
hell*ire you guys going? You'll be 
in my sector in ten seconds." 

Rioz said. "I'm chasing a 
shell." 

"In my sector?" 

"It started in mine and you're 
not in position to get it. Shut off 
that radio, Ted." 

r ¥^HE ship thundered through 
space, a thunder that could 
be heard only within the hull. 
And then Rioz cut the engines 
in stages large enough to make 
Long flail forward. The sudden 
silence was more ear-shattering 
than the noise that had preceded 
it. 

Rioz said, "All right. Let me 



have the 'scope." 

They both watched. The shell 
was a definite truncated cone 
now. tumbling with slow solemnity as it passed along among the 
stars. 

"It's a Class A shell, all right." 
said Rioz, with satisfaction. A 
giant among shells, he thought. It 
would put them into the black. 

Long said, "We've got another 
pip on the scanner. I think it's 
Swenson taking after us." 

Rioz scarcely gave it a glance. 
"He won't catch us." 

The shell grew larger still, 
filling the visiplate. 

Rioz's hands were on the harpoon lever. He waited, adjusted 
the angle microscopically twice, 
played out the length allotment. 
Then he yanked, tripping the release. 

For a moment, nothing happened. Then a metal mesh cable 
snaked out onto the visiplate, 
moving toward the shell like a 
striking cobra. It made contact, 
but it did not hold. If it had. 
been designed to hold, it would 
have snapped instantly like a 
cobweb strand. The shell was 
turning with a rotational momentum amounting to thousands of 
tons. What the cable did do was 
to set up a powerful magnetic 
field that acted as a brake on 
the shell. 

Another cable and another 
lashed out. Rioz sent them out 



)4 




 



in an almost heedless expenditure 
of energy. 

"I'll get this one ! By Mars, 
I'll get this one!" 

With some two dozen cables 
stretching between ship and shell, 
he desisted. The shell's rotational 
energy, converted by braking into heat, had raised its temperature to a point where its radiation 
could be picked up by the ship's 
meters. 

Long said, "Do you want me 
to put our brand on?" 

"Suits me. But you don't have 
to, if you don't want to. It's my 
watch." 

"I don't mind." 

Long clambered into his suit 
and went out the lock. It was 
the surest sign of his newness 
to the game that he could count 
the number of times he had been 
out in space in a suit. This was 
the fifth time. 

He went out along the nearest 
cable, hand over hand, feeling 
the vibration of the mesh against 
the metal of his mitten. 

He burned their serial number 
in the smooth metal of the shell. 
There was nothing to oxidize the 
steel in the emptiness of space. 
It simply melted and vaporized, 
condensing some feet away from 
the energy beam, turning the surface it touched into a gray, powdery dullness. 

Long swung back toward the 
ship. • 



Inside again, he took off his 
helmet, white and thick with frost 
that collected as soon as he had 
entered. 

The first thing he heard was 
Swenson's voice coming over the 
radio in thick, almost unrecognizable rage: " — straight to the 
Commissioner. Damn it. there are 
rules to this game!" 

Rioz sat back, unbothered. 
"Look, it hit my sector. I was 
late spotting it and I chased it 
into yours. You couldn't have 
gotten it with Mars for a backstop. That's all there is to it — You 
back, Long?" 

He cut contact. 

The signal button raged at him. 
but he paid no attention. 

"He's going to the Commissioner?" Long asked. 

"Not a chance. He just goes on 
like that because it breaks the 
monotony. He doesn't mean anything by it. He knows it's our 
shell. And how do you like that 
hunk of stuff. Ted?" 

"Pretty good." 

"Pretty good? It's terrific! Hold 
on. I'm setting it swinging." 

The side jets spat steam and 
the ship started a slow rotation 
about the shell. The shell followed it. In thirty minutes, they 
were a gigantic bolo spinning in 
emptiness. Long checked the 
Ephemeris for the position of 
Deimos. 

At a precisely calculated mo

merit, the cables released their 
magnetic field and the shell went 
streaking off tangentially in a trajectory that would, in a day or 
::o, bring it within pronging distance of the shell -stores on the, 
Martian satellite. 

Rioz watched it go. He felt 
good. He turned to Long. "This 
is one fine day for us." 

"What about Hilder's speech?" 
asked Long. 

"What? Who? Oh, that. Listen, 
if I had to worry about everything some damned Grounder 
said, I'd never get any sleep. 
Forget it." 

"I don't think we should forget 
it." 

"You're nuts. Don't bother me 
about it, will you? Get some sleep 
instead."

rpED LONG found the breadth 
and height of the city's main 
thoroughfare exhilarating. It had 
been two months since the Commissioner had declared a moratorium on scavenging and had 
pulled all ships out of space, but 
this feeling of a stretched -out 
vista had not stopped thrilling 
Long. Even the thought that the 
moratorium was called pending 
a decision on the part of Earth 
to enforce its new insistence on 
water economy, by deciding upon 
a ration limit for scavenging, did 



not cast him entirely down. 

The roof of the avenue was 1 
painted a luminous light blue, 
perhaps as an old-fashioned imitation of Earth's sky. Ted wasn't 
sure. The walls were lit with the 
store windows that pierced it. 

Off in the distance, over the 
hum of traffic and the sluffing 
noise of people's feet passing him, 
he could hear the intermittent 
blasting as new channels were being bored into Mars' crust. All 
his life he remembered such blastings. The ground he walked on 
had been part of solid unbroken rock when he was born. The city 
was growing and would keep on 
growing — if Earth would only let 
it. • •-. 

He turned off at a cross-street, 
narrower, not quite as brilliantly 
lit, shop windows giving way to 
apartment houses, each with its 
row of lights along the front facade. Shoppers and traffic gave 
way to slower-paced individuals 
and to squawling youngsters who 
had as yet evaded the maternal 
summons to the evening meal. 

At the last minute, Long remembered the social amenities 
and stopped off at a corner water 
store. 

He passed over his canteen. 
"Fill 'er up." 

The plump storekeeper unscrewed the cap, cocked an eye 
into the opening. He shook it a 
little and let it gurgle. "Not much

left," he said cheerfully. 

"No," agreed Long. 

The storekeeper trickled water 
in, holding the neck of the canteen close to the hose tip to avoid 
spillage. The volume gauge 
whirred. He screwed the cap back 
on. 

Long passed over the coins and 
took his canteen. It clanked 
against his hip now with a pleasing heaviness. It would never do 
to a visit a family without a full 
canteen. Among the boys, it 
didn't matter. Not as much, anyway. 

He entered the hallway of number 27, climbed a short flight of 
stairs, and paused with his thumb 
on the signal. 

The sound of voices could be 
heard quite plainly. 

One was a woman's voice, 
somewhat shrill. "It's all right for 
you to have your Scavenger 
friends here, isn't it? I'm supposed to be thankful you manage 
to get home two months a year. 
Oh, it's quite enough that you 
spend a day or two with me. After 
that, it's the Scavengers again." 

"I've been home for a long 
time now," said a male voice, 
"and this is business. For Mars' 
sake, let up, Dora. They'll be here 
soon." 

Long decided to wait a moment 
before signaling. It might give 
them a chance to hit a more neutral topic. 



"What do I care if they come?" 
retorted Dora. "Let them hear 
me. And I'd just as soon the 
Commissioner kept the moratorium on permanently. You hear 
me?" 

"And what would we live on?" 
came the male voice, hotly. "You 
tell me that." 

"I'Tl tell you. You can make a 
decent, honorable living right here 
on Mars, juit like everybody else. 
I'm the only one in this apartment house that's a Scavenger 
widow. That's what I am — a widow. I'm worse than a widow, 
because if I were a widow, I'd 
at least have a chance to marry 
someone else — What did you 
say?" 

"Nothing. Nothing at all." 

"Oh, I know what you said. 
Now listen here, Dick Swenson — " 

"I only said," cried Swenson, 
"that now I know why Scavengers usually don't marry." 

"You shouldn't have, either. 
I'm tired of having every person 
in the neighborhood pity me and 
smirk and ask when you're coming home. Other people can be 
mining engineers and administrators and even tunnel -borers. 
At least tunnel -borers' wives have 
a decent home-life and their children don't grow up like vagabonds. Peter might as well not 
have a father — " 

A thin boy-soprano voice made 
its way through the door. It was 



18 




 



somewhat more distant, as though 
it were in another room. "Hey, 
Mom, what's a vagabond?" 

Dora's voice rose a notch. 
"Peter! You keep your mind on 
your homework." 

Swenson said, in a low voice, 
"It's not right to talk this way 
in front of the kid. What kind 
of notions will he get about me?" 

"Stay home then and teach him 
better notions." 

Peter's voice called out again. 
"Hey, Mom, I'm going to be a 
Scavenger when I. grow up." 

Footsteps sounded rapidly. 
There was a momentary hiatus 
in the sounds, then a piercing, 
"Mom! Hey, Mom! Leggo my 
ear! What did I do?" and a snuffling silence. 

Long seized the chance. He 
worked the signal vigorously. 

OWENSON opened the door, 
^ brushing down his hair with 
both hands. 

"Hello, Ted," he said, in a subdued voice. Then loudly, "Ted's 
here, .Dora. Where's Mario, Ted?" 

Long said, "He'll be here in 
a while." 

Dora came hustling out of the 
next room, a small, dark woman 
with a pinched nose, and hair, 
just beginning to show touches 
of gray, combed off the forehead. 

"Hello, Ted. Have you eaten?" 
"Quite well, thanks. I haven't 



interrupted you, have I?" 

"Not at all. We finished ages 
ago. Would you like some coffee?" 

"I think so." Ted unslung his 
canteen and offered it. 

"Oh, goodness, that's all right. 
We've plenty of water." 

"I insist." 

"Well, then—" 

Back into the kitchen she went. 
Through the swinging door, Long 
caught a glimpse of dishes sitting in Secoterg, the "waterless 
cleaner that soaks up and absorbs grease and dirt in a twinkling. One ounce of water will 
rinse eight square feet of dish 
surface clean as clean. Buy Secoterg. Secoterg just cleans it right, 
makes your dishes shiny bright, 
does away with water waste — " 

The tune started whining 
through his mind and Long 
crushed it with speech. He said, 
"How's Pete?" 

"Fine, fine. The kid's in the 
fourth grade now. You know, I 
don't get to see him much. Well, 
sir, when I came back last time, 
he, looked at me and said — " 

It went on for a while and 
wasn't too bad as bright-sayingsof - bright - children - as - told by -dull -parents go. 

The door signal burped and 
Mario Rioz came in, frowning 
and red. 

Swenson stepped to him quickly. "Listen, don't say anything 



THE MARTIAN WAY

about shell-snaring. Dora still remembers the time you fingered a 
Class A shell out of my territory 
and she's in one of her moods 
now." 

"Who the hell wants to talk 
about shells?" Rioz slung off a 
fur-lined jacket, threw it over 
the back of the chair, and sat 
down. 

Dora came through the swinging door, viewed the newcomer 
with a synthetic smile and said, 
"Hello, Mario. Coffee for you, 
too?" 

"Yeah," he said, reaching automatically for his canteen. 

"Just use some more of my 
water, Dora," said Long, quickly. 
"He'll owe it to me." 

"Yeah," said Rioz. 
%'What's wrong, Mario?" asked 
l.ong. 

Rioz said, heavily. "Go on. Say 
you told me so. A year ago, when 
Hilder made that speech, you told 
me so. Say it." 

Long shrugged. 

Rioz said, "They've set up the 
quota. Fifteen minutes ago, the 
news came out." 

"Well?" 

"Fifty thousand tons of water 
per trip." * , 

"What?" yelled Swenson. burning. "You can't get off Mars with 
fifty thousand!" 

"That's the figure. It's a deliberate piece of gutting. No more 
scavenging." 



TAORA came out with the coffee 
and set it down all around. 
"What's all this about ho more 
scavenging?" She sat down very 
firmly and Swenson looked helpless. 

"It seems," said Long, "that 
they're rationing us at fifty thousand tons and that means we 
can't make any more trips." 

"Well, what of it?" Dora sipped 
her coffee and smiled gaily. "If 
you want my opinion, it's a good 
thing. It's time all you Scavengers found yourselves a nice, 
steady job here on Mars. . I mean 
it. It's no life to be running all 
over space — " 

"Please, Dora," said Swenson. 

Rioz came close to a snort. 

Dora raised' her eyebrows. "I'm 
just giving my opinions." 

Long said, "Please feel free to 
do so. But I would like to say 
something. Fifty thousand is just 
a detail. We know that Earth — 
or at least Hilder's party — wants 
to make political capital out of a 
campaign for water economy, so 
we're in a bad hole. We've got 
to get water somehow, or they'll 
shut us down altogether, right?" 

"Well, sure," said Swenson. 

"But the question is how. 
right?" 

"If it's only getting water," 
said Rioz, in a sudden gush of 
words, "there's only one thing 
to do and you know it. If the 
Grounders won't give us water, 




 



we'll take it. The water doesn't 
belong to them just because their 
fathers and grandfathers were too 
damned sick-yellow ever to leave 
their fat planet. Water belongs 
to people wherever they are. 
We're people and the water's 
ours, too. We have a right to it." 

"How do you propose taking 
it?" asked Long. 

"Easy! They've got oceans of 
water on Earth. They can't post 
a guard over every square mile. 
We can sink down on the night 
side of the planet any time we 
want, fill our shells, then get 
away. How can they stop lis?" 

"In half a dozen ways, Mario. 
How do you spot shells in space 
up to distances of a hundred 
thousand miles? One thin metal 
shell in all that space. How? By 
radar. Do you think there's no 
radar on Earth? Do you think 
that if Earth ever gets the notion 
we're engaged in waterlegging, it 
won't be simple for them to set 
up a radar network to spot ships 
coming in from space?" 

Dora broke in, indignantly. 
"I'll tell you one thing, Mario 
Rioz. My husband isn't going to 
be part of any raid to get water 
to keep up his scavenging with." 

"It isn't just scavenging," said 
Mario. "Next they'll be cutting 
down on everything else. We've 
got to stop them now." 

"But we don't need their water, 
anyway," said Dora. "We're not 



the Moon or Venus. We pipe 
enough water down from the 
polar caps for all we need. We 
have a water tap right in this 
apartment. There's one in every 
apartment on this block." 

Long said, "Home use is the 
smallest part of it. The mines 
use water. And what do we do 
about the hydroponic tanks?" 

"That's right," said Swenson. 
"What about the ' hydroponic 
tanks, Dora? They've got to have 
water and it's about time we arranged to grow our own fresh 
food instead of having to live on 
the condensed crud they ship us 
from Earth." 

"Listen to him." said Dora, 
scornfully. "What do you know 
about fresh food? You've never 
eaten any." 

"I've eaten more than you 
think. Do you remember those 
carrots I picked up once?" 

"Well, what was so wonderful 
about them? If you ask me, good 
baked protomeal is much better. 
And healthier, too. It just seems 
to be the fashion now to be talking fresh vegetables, because 
they're increasing taxes for these 
hydroponics. Besides, all this will 
blow over." 

T ONG said. "I don't think so. 

Not by itself, anyway. Hilder 
will probably be the next Coordinator and then things may 
really get bad. If they cut. down 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



on food shipments, too — " 

"Well, then," shouted Rioz, 
"what do we do? I still cay take 
it! Take the water!" 

"And I say we can't do that, 
Mario. Don't you see that what 
you're suggesting is the Earth 
way, the Grounder way? You're 
trying to hold on to the umbilical cord that ties Mars to Earth. 
Can't you get away from that? 
Can't you s« the Martian way?" 

"No, I can't. Suppose you tell 
me." 

"I will, if you'll listen. When 
we think about the Solar System, 
what do we think about? Mercury, Venus. Earth, Moon. Mars, 
Phobos, and Deimos. There you 
are — seven bodies, that's all. But 
that doesn't represent one per 
cant of the Solar System. We 
Martians are right at the edge of 
the other ninety -nine per cent. 
Out there, farther from the Sun, 
there's unbelievable amounts of 
water!" 

The others stared. 

Swenson said, uncertainly. 
"You mean the layers of ice on 
Jupiter and Saturn?" 

"Not that specifically, but it 
is water, you'll admit. A thousand-mile-thick layer of water is 
a lot of water." 

"But it's all covered up with 
layers of ammonia or — or something, isn't it?" asked Swenson. 
"Besides, we can't land on the 
major planets." 



"I know that." said Long, "but 
I haven't said that was the answer. The major planets aren't 
the only objects out there. What 
about the asteroids and the satellites? Vesta is a two-hundredmile-diameter asteroid that's 
hardly more than a chunk of ice. 
One of the moons of Saturn is 
mostly ice. How about that?" 

Rioz said, "Haven't you ever 
been in space, Ted?" 

"You know I have. Why do 
you ask?" 

"Sure, I know you have, but 
you still talk like a Grounder. 
Have you thought of the distances involved? The average 
asteroid is a hundred twenty million miles from Mars at the 
closest. That's twice the VenusMars hop and you know that 
hardly any liners do even that 
in one jump. They usually stop 
off at Earth or the Moon. After 
all, how long do you expect anyone to stay in space, man?" 

"I don't know. What's your 
limit?" 

"You know the limit. You don't 
have to ask me. It's six months. 
That's handbook data. After six 
months, if you're still in space, 
you're psychotherapy meat. 
Right, Dick?" 

Swenson nodded. 

"And that's just the asteroids." 
Rioz went on. "From Mars to 
Jupiter is three hundred thirty 
million miles, and to Saturn it's 



22 




 



seven hundred million. How can 
anyone hand-le that kind of distance? Suppose you hit standard 
velocity or to make it even, say 
you get up to a good two hundred 
kilomiles an hour. It would take 
you — let's see, allowing time for 
acceleration and deceleration — 
about six or seven months to get 
to Jupiter and nearly a year to 
get to Saturn. Of course, you 
could hike the speed to a million 
miles an hour, theoretically, but 
where would you get the water to 
do that?" 

"Gee," said a small voice, attached to a smutty nose and 
round eyes, "Saturn!" 

Dora whirled in her chair. 
"Peter, march right back into 
your room!" 

"Aw, Ma." 

"Don't 'aw, Ma' me." She began to get out of the chair, and 
Peter scuttled away. 

Swenson said, "Say, Dora, why 
don't you keep him company for 
a while? It's hard to keep his 
mind on homework if we're all 
out here talking." 

Dora sniffed obstinately and 
stayed put, "I'll sit right here 
until I find out what Ted Long 
is thinking of. I tell you right 
now I don't like the sound of it." 

C WENSON said , nervously . 
^ "Well, never mind Jupiter 
and Saturn. I'm sure Ted isn't 
figuring on that. But what about 



Vesta? We could make it in ten 
or twelve weeks there and the 
same back. And two hundred 
miles in diameter. That's four 
million cubic miles of icef" 

"So what?" said Rioz. "What 
do we do on Vesta? Quarry the 
ice? Set up mining machinery? 
Say, do you know how long that 
would take?" 

Long said, "I'm talking about 
Saturn, not Vesta." 

Rioz addressed an unseen audience. "I tell him seven hundred 
million miles and he keeps on 
talking." 

"All right," said Long, "suppose you tell me how you know 
we can only stay in space six 
months, Mario?" 

"It's common knowledge, damn 
it." 

"Because it's in the Handbook 
of Space Flight. It's data compiled by Earth scientists from experience with Earth pilots and 
spacemen. You're stilt thinking 
Grounder style. You won't think 
the Martian way." 

"A Martian may be a Martian, but he's still a man." 

"But how can you be so blind? 
How many times have you fellows been out for over six months 
without a break?" 

Rioz said, "That's different.'* 
' "Because you're Martians? Because you're professional Scavengers?" 

"No. Because we're not on a 



THE m\ R T I AN WAY 



flight. We can put back for Mars 
any time we want to." 

"But you don'r want to. That's 
my point. Earthmen have tremendous ships with libraries of films, 
with a crew of fifteen plus passengers. Still, they can only stay 
out six months maximum. Martian Scavengers have a two room 
ship with only one partner. But 
we can stick it out more than 
six months." 

r\ORA said, "I suppose you 
want to stay in a ship for a 
year and go to Saturn." 

"Why not, Dora?" said Long. 
"We can do it. Don't you see we 
can? Earthmen can't. They've got 
a real world. They've got open 
sky and fresh food, all the air 
and water they want. Getting into 
a ship is a terrible change for 
them. More than six months is 
too much for them for that very 
reason. Martians are different. 
We've been living on a ship our 
entire lives. 

"That's all Mars is — a ship. 
It's just a big ship forty-five hundred miles across with one tiny 
room in it occupied by fifty thousand people. It's closed in like a 
ship. We breathe packaged air 
and drink packaged water which 
we repurify over and over. We eat 
the same food-rations we eat 
aboard ship. When we get into 
a ship, it's the same thing we've 
known all our lives. We can stand 



it for a lot more than a year if 
we have to." 

Dora said, "Dick, too?" 

"We all can." 

"Well, Dick can't. It's all very 
well for you. Ted Long, and this 
shell-stealer here, this Mario, to 
talk about jaunting off for a year. 
You're not married. Dick is. He 
has a wife and he has a child and 
that's enough for him. He can just 
get a regular job right here on 
Mars. Why. my goodness, suppose you go to Saturn and find 
there's no water there. How'll you 
get back? Even if you had water 
left, you'd be out of food. It's the 
most ridiculous thing I ever heard 
of." 

"No. Now listen," said Long, 
tightly. "I've thought this thing 
out. I've talked to Commissioner 
Sankov and he'll help. But we've 
got to have ships and men. I can't 
get them. The men won't listen 
to me. I'm green. You two are 
known and respected. You're veterans. If you back me, even if 
you don't go yourselves, if you'll 
just help me sell this thing to 
the rest, get volunteers — " 

"First," said Rioz. grumpily, 
"you'll have to do a lot more 
explaining. Once we get to Saturn, 
where's the water?" 

"That's the beauty of it," said 
Long. "That's why it's got to be 
Saturn. The water there is just 
floating around in space for the 
taking."

V 

M/HEN Hamish Sankov had 
come to Mars, there was no 
such thing as a native Martian. 
Now there were two-hundred-odd 
babies whose grandfathers had 
been born on Mars — natives in 
the third generation. 

When he had come as a boy in 
his teens, Mars had been scarcely 
more than a huddle of grounded 
spaceships connected by sealed 
underground tunnels, Through 
the years, he had seen buildings 
grow and burrow widely, thrusting blunt snouts up into the thin, 
unbreathable atmosphere. He had 
seen huge storage depots spring 
up into which spaceships and 
their loads could be swallowed 
whole. He had seen the mines 
grow from nothing to a huge 
gouge in the Martian crust, while 
the population of Mars grew from 
fifty to fifty thousand. 

It made him feel old, these long 
memories — they and the even 
dimmer memories induced by the 
presence of this Earthman before 
him. His visitor brought up those 
long-forgotten scraps of thought 
about a soft-warm world that was 
as kind and gentle to mankind as 
the mother's womb. 

The Earthman seemed fresh 
from that womb. Not very tall, 
not very lean; in fact, distinctly 
plump. Dark hair with a neat 
little wave in it, a neat little mus


tache and neatly scrubbed skin. 
His clothing was right in style 
and as fresh and neatly turned as 
plastek could be. 

Sankov's own clothes were of 
Martian manufacture, serviceable 
and clean, but many years behind 
the times. His face was craggy 
and lined, his hair was pure white 
and his Adam's apple wobbled 
when he talked. 

The Earthman was Myron 
Digby, member of Earth's General Assembly. Sankov was Martian Commissioner. 

Sankov said, "This all hits us 
hard, Assemblyman." 

"It's hit most of us hard, too. 
Commissioner." 

"Uh-huh. Can't honestly say 
then that I can make it out. Of 
course, you understand, I don't 
make out that I can understand 
Earth ways, for all that I was 
born there. Mars is a hard place 
to live, Assemblyman, and you 
have to understand that. It takes 
a lot of shipping space just to 
bring us food, water, and raw materials so we can live. There's not 
much room left for books and 
news-films. Even video programs 
can't reach Mars, except for 
about a month when Earth is in 
conjunction, and even then nobody has much time to listen. 

"My office gets a weekly summary film from Planetary Press. 
Generally, I don't have time to 
pay attention to it. Maybe you'd 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



25 



call us provincial, and you'd be 
right. When something like this 
happens, all we can do is kind 
of helplessly look at each other." 

Digby said, slowly, "You can't 
mean that your people on Mars 
haven't heard of Hilder's antiWaster campaign." 

"No, can't exactly say that. 
There's a young Scavenger, son 
of a good friend of mine who died 
in space — " Sankov scratched the 
side of his neck doubtfully — "who 
makes a hobby out of reading up 
on Earth history and things like 
that. He catches video broadcasts when he's out in space and 
he listened to this man Hilder. 
Near as I can make out, that was 
the first talk Hilder made about 
Wasters. 

"Jhe young fellow came to me 
with that. Naturally, I didn't take 
him very serious. I kept an eye 
on the .Planetary Press films for 
a while after that, but there 
wasn't much mention of Hilder 
and what there was made him out 
to look pretty funny." 

"Yes, Commissioner," said Digby, "it all seemed quite a joke 
when it started." 

OANKOV stretched out a pair 
^ of long legs to one side of his 
desk and crossed them at the 
ankles. "Seems to me it's still 
pretty much of a joke. What's his 
argument? We're using up water. 
Has he tried looking at some fig


ures? I got them all here. Had 
them brought to me when this 
committee arrived. 

"Seems that Earth has four 
hundred million cubic miles of 
water in its oceans and each cubic 
mile weighs four and a half billion tons. That's a lot of water. 
Now we use some of that heap in 
space flight. Most of the thrust 
is inside Earth's gravitational 
field, and that means the water 
thrown out finds its way back to 
the oceans. Hilder doesn't figure 
that in. When he says a million 
tons of water is used up per flight, 
he's a liar. It's less than a hundred thousand tons. 

"Suppose, now, we have fifty 
thousand flights a year. We don't, 
of course; not even fifteen hundred. But let's say there are 
fifty thousand. I figura there's going to be considerable expansion 
as time goes on. With fifty thousand flights, one cubic mile of 
water would be lost to space each 
year. That means that in a million years Earth would lose onequarter of one per cent of its total 
water supply!" 

Digby spread his hands, palms 
upward, and let them drop. 
"Commissioner, Interplanetary 
Alloys has used figures like that 
in their campaign against Hilder, 
but you can't fight a tremendous, 
emotion-filled drive with cold 
mathematics. This man Hilder 
has invented a name, 'Wasters.' 



26 




 



Slowly, he has built this name 
up into a gigantic conspiracy ; 
a gang of brutal profit-seeking 
wretches raping Earth for their 
own immediate benefit, 

"He has accused the government of being riddled with them, 
the Assembly of being dominated 
by them, the press of being owned 
by them. None of this, unfortunately, seems ridiculous to the 
average man. He knows all too 
well what selfish men can do to 
Earth's resources. He knows what 
happened to Earth's oil during 
the Time of Troubles, for instance, and the way topsoil was 
ruined. 

"When a farmer experiences a 
drought, he doesn't care that the 
amount of water lost in space 
flight isn't a droplet in a fog as 
far as Earth's overall water supply is concerned. Hilder has given 
him something to blame and 
that's the strongest possible consolation for disaster. He isn't going to give that up for a diet of 
figures." 

Sankov said, "That's where I 
get puzzled. Maybe it's because 
I don't know how things work on 
Earth, but it seems to me that 
there aren't just droughty farmers 
there. As near as I could make 
out from the news summaries, 
these Hilder people are a minority. Why is it Earth goes along 
with a few farmers and some 
crackpots that egg them on?" 



"Because, Commissioner, there 
are such things as worried human 
beings. The steel industry sees 
that an era of space flight will 
stress increasingly the light nonferrous alloys. The various 
miners' unions worry about extraterrestrial competition. Any 
Earthman who can't get aluminum to ljuild a pre-fab is certain 
that it is because the aluminum 
is going to Mars. I know a professor of archaeology who's an 
anti-Waster because he can't get 
a government grant to cover his 
excavations. He's convinced that 
all government money is going into rocketry research and space 
medicine and he resents it." 

Sankov said, "That doesn't 
sound like Earth people are much 
different from us here on Mars. 
But what about the General Assembly? Why do they have to 
go along with Hilder?" 

"pwlGBY smiled sourly. "Politics 
isn't pleasant to explain. Hilder introduced this bill to set up 
a committee to investigate waste 
in space flight. Maybe threefourths or more of the General 
Assembly was against such an investigation as an intolerable and 
useless extension of bureaucracy 
— which it is. But then how could 
any legislator be against a mere 
investigation of waste? It would 
sound as though he had something to fear or to conceal. It 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



27 



would sound as though he were 
himself profiting from waste. Hilder is not in the least afraid of 
making such accusations, and 
whether true or not, they would 
be a powerful factor with the 
voters in the next election. The 
bill passed. 

"And then there came the question of appointing the members 
of the committee. Those who were 
against Hilder shied away from 
membership, which would have 
meant decisions that would be 
continually embarrassing. Remaining on the sidelines would 
make that one that much less a 
target for Hilder. The result is 
that I am the only member of 
the committee who is outspokenly 
anti-Hilder and it may cost me 
re -election." 

Sankov said, "I'd be sorry to 
see that, Assemblyman. It looks 
as though Mars didn't have as 
many friends as we thought we 
had. We wouldn't like to lose one. 
But if Hilder wins out, what's 
he after, anyway?" 

"I should think," said Digby. 
"that that is obvious. He wants 
to be the next Global Coordinator." ' 

"Think he'll make it?" 

"If nothing happens to stop 
him, he will." 

"And then what? Will he drop 
this Waster campaign then?" 

"I can't say. I don't know if 
he's laid his plans past the Co


ordinacy. Still, if you want my 
guess, he couldn't abandon the 
campaign and maintain his popularity. It's gotten out of hand." 

Sankov scratched the side of his 
neck. "All right. In that case, 
I'll ask you for some advice. 
What can we folks on Mars do? 
You know Earth. You know the 
situation. We don't. Tell us what 
to do." 

Digby rose and stepped to the 
window. He looked out upon the 
low domes of other buildings; 
red, rocky, completely desolate 
plain in between; a purple sky 
and a shrunken sun. 

He said, without turning. "Do 
you people really like it on 
Mars?" 

Sankov smiled. "Most of us 
don't exactly know any other 
world, Assemblyman. Seems to 
me Earth would be something 
queer and uncomfortable to 
them." 

"But wouldn't Martians get 
used to it? Earth' isn't hard to 
take after this. Wouldn't your 
people learn to enjoy the privilege 
of breathing air under an open 
sky? You once lived on Earth. 
You remember what it was like." 

"I sort of remember. Still, it 
doesn't seem to be easy to explain. 
Earth is just there. It fits* people 
and people fit it. People take 
Earth the way they find it. Mars 
is different. It's sort of raw and 
doesn't fit people. People got to 



28 




 



make something out of it. They 
got to build a world, and not take 
what they find. Mars isn't much 
yet, but we're building and when 
we're finished, we're going to have 
just what we like. It's sort of a 
great feeling to know you're 
building a world. Earth would be 
kind of unexciting after that." 

T^HE Assemblyman said, "Surely the ordinary Martian isn't 
such a philosopher that he's content to live this terribly hard 
life for the sake of a future that 
must be hundreds of generations 
away." 

"No-o, not just like that." Sankov put his right ankle on his 
left knee and cradled it as he 
spoke. "Like I said, Martians are 
a lot like Earthmen, which means 
they're sort of human beings, and 
human beings don't go in for philosophy much. Just the same, 
there's something to living in a 
growing world, whether you think 
about it much or not. 

"My father used to send me 
letters when I first carne to Mars. 
He was an accountant and he 
just sort of stayed an accountant. 
Earth wasn't much different when 
he died from what it was when 
he was born. He didn't see anything happen. Every day was like 
every other day, and living was 
just a way of passing time until 
he died. 

"On Mars, it's different. Every 



day there's something new — the 
city's bigger, the ventilation system gets another kick, the water 
lines from the poles get slicked 
up. Right now, we're planning to 
set up a news-film association of 
our own. We're going to call it 
Mars Press. If you haven't lived 
when things are growing all about 
you, you'll never understand how 
wonderful it feels. 

"No, Assemblyman, Mars is 
hard and tough and Earth is a 
lot more comfortable, but seems 
to me, if you take our boys to 
Earth, they'll be unhappy. They 
probably wouldn't be able to figure out why, most of them, but 
they'd feel lost; lost and useless. Seems to me lots of them 
would never make the adjustment." 

Digby turned away from the 
window and the smooth, pink 
skin of his forehead was creased 
into a frown. "In that case, Commissioner, I am sorry for you. For 
all of you." 

"Why?" 

"Because I don't think there's 
anything your people on Mars 
can do. Or the people on the 
Moon or Venus. It won't happen 
now; maybe it won't happen for 
a year or two, or even for five 
years. But pretty soon you'll all 
have to come back to Earth, unless — " 

Sankov's white eyebrows bent 
low over his eyes. "Well?" 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



29 



"Unless you can find another 
source of water besides the planet 
Earth." 

Sankov shook his head. "Don't 
seem likely, does it?" 
"Not very." 

"And except for that, seems 
to you there's no chance?" 
"None at all.'" 

Digby said that and left, and 
Sankov stared for a long time 
at nothing before he punched a 
combination of the local communi-line. 

After a while, Ted Long looked 
out at him. 

Sankov said, "You were right, 
son. There's nothing they can do. 



Even the ones that mean well see 
no way out. How did you know?" 

"Commissioner," said Long, 
"when you've read all you can 
about the Time of Troubles, particularly about the twentieth century, nothing political can come 
as a real surprise." 

"Well, maybe. Anyway, son, 
Assemblyman Digby is sorry for 
us, quite a piece sorry, you might 
say, but that's all. He says we'll 
have to leave Mars— or else get 
water somewhere else. Only he 
thinks that we can't get water 
somewhere else." 

"You know we can, don't you, 
Commissioner?"

"I know we mi&ht, son. It's a 
terrible risk." 

"If I find enough volunteers, 
the risk is our business." 

"How is it going?" 

"Not bad. Some of the boys 
are on my side right now. I talked 
Mario Rioz into it, for instance, 
and you know he's one of the 
best." 

"That's just it — the volunteers 
will be the best men we have. 
I hate to allow it." 

"If we get back, it will be worth 
it." 

"If! It's a big word, son." 
"And a big thing we're trying 
to do." 



"Well, I gave my word that if 
there was no help on Earth, I'll 
see that the Phobos water-hole

HALF a million miles above 
Saturn, Mario Rioz was 
cradled on nothing and sleep was 
delicious. He came out of it slowly and for a while, alone in his 
suit, he counted the stars and 
traced lines from one to another. 

At first, as the weeks flew past, 
it was .scavenging all over again, 
except for the gnawing feeling

that tvtry minute meant an additional number of thousands of 
miles away from all humanity. 
That made it worse. 

They had aimed high to pass 
out of the ecliptic while moving 
through the Asteroid Belt. That 
had used up water and had probably been unnecessary. Although 
tens of thousands of worldlets 
look as thick as vermin in twodimensional projection upon a 
photographic plate, they are 
nevertheless scatteted so thinly 
through the quadrillions of cubic 
miles that make up their conglomerate orbit that only the 
most ridiculous of coincidences 
would have brought about a collision. 

* Still, they passed over the Belt 
and someone calculated the 
chances of collision with a fragment of matter large enough to 
do damage. The value was so low, 
so impossibly low. that it was 
perhaps inevitable that the notion 
of the "space-float" should occur 
to someone. 

The days were long and many, 
space was empty, only one man 
was needed at the controls at any 
one time. The thought was a 
natural. 

First, it was a particularly daring one who ventured out for fifteen minutes or so. Then another 
who tried half an hour. Eventually, before the asteroids were 
entirely behind, each ship regu32 G 



larly had its off-watch member 
suspended in space at the end 
of a cable. 

It was easy enough. The cable, 
one of those intended for operations at the conclusion of their 
journey, was magnetically attached at both ends, one to the 
spacesuit to start with. Then you 
clambered out the lock onto the 
ship's hull and attached the other 
end there. You paused a while, 
clinging to the metal skin by the 
electro-magnets in your boots. 
Then you neutralized those *and 
made the slightest muscular effort. 

Slowly, ever so slowly, you 
lifted from the ship and even 
more slowly the ship's larger mass 
moved an equivalently shorter 
distance downward. You floated 
incredibly, weightlessly, in solid, 
speckled black. When the ship 
had moved far enough away from 
you. your gauntleted hand, which 
kept touch upon the cable, tightened its grip slightly. Too tightly, and you would begin moving 
back toward the ship and it 
toward you. Just tightly enough, 
and friction would halt you. Because your motion was equivalent to that of the ship, it seemed 
as motionless below you as 
though it had been painted 
against an impossible background 
while the cable between you hung 
in coils that had no reason to 
straighten out. 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It was a ship to your eye. One 
half was lit by the light of the 
feeble Sun, which was still too 
bright to look at directly without 
the heavy protection of the polarized spacesuit visor. The other 
half was black on black, invisible. 

Space closed in and it was like 
sleep. Your suit was warm, it 
renewed its air automatically, it 
had food and drink in special 
containers from which it could be 
sucked with a minimal motion of 
the head, it took care of wastes 
appropriately. Most of all, more 
than anything else, there was the 
delightful euphoria of weightlessness. 

You never felt so well in your 
life. The days stopped being too 
long, they weren't long enough, 
and there weren't enough of them. 

THEY had passed Jupiter's orbit at a spot some thirty degrees from its then position. For 
months it was the brightest object in the sky, always excepting 
the glowing white pea that 
was the Sun. At its brightest, 
some of the Scavengers insisted 
they could make out Jupiter as a 
tiny sphere, one side squashed 
out of true by the night-shadow. 

Then over a period of additional months it faded, while another dot of light grew until it 
was brighter than Jupiter. It was 
Saturn, first as a dot of brilliance, 
then as an oval, glowing splotch. 



("Why oval?" someone asked 
and after a while someone else 
said, "The rings, of course," and 
it was obvious.) 

Everyone space-floated at all 
possible times toward the end, 
watching Saturn incessantly. 

("Hey, you jerk, come on back 
in, damn it. You're on duty." 
"Who's on duty? I've got fifteen 
minutes more by my watch." 
"You set your watch back. Besides, I gave you twenty minutes 
yesterday." "You wouldn't give 
two minutes to your grandmother." "Come on in, damn it, 
or I'm coming out anyway." "All 
right, I'm coming. Holy howlers, 
what a racket over a lousy minute." But no quarrel could possibly be serious; not in space. It 
felt too good.) 

Saturn grew until at last it 
rivaled and then surpassed the 
Sun. The rings, set at a broad 
angle to their trajectory of approach, swept grandly about the 
planet, only a small portion being eclipsed. Then, as they approached, the span of the rings 
grew still wider, yet narrower as 
the angle of approach constantly 
decreased. 

The larger moons showed up 
in the surrounding sky like serene 
fireflies. 

Mario Rioz was glad he was 
awake so that he could watch 
again. 

Saturn filled half the sky, 



THE MARTIAN WAY

streaked with orange, the night 
shadow cutting it fuzzily nearly 
one-quarter of Hhe way in from 
the right. Two round little dotsin the brightness were shadows of 
two of the moons. To the left 
and behind him (he could look 
over his left shoulder to see, and 
as he did so, the rest of his body 
inched slightly to the right to 
conserve angular momentum) 
was the white diamond of the 
Sun. 

Most of all he liked to watch 
the rings. At the left, they 
emerged from behind Saturn, a 
tight, bright triple band of orange 
light. At the right, their beginnings were hidden in the night 
shadow, but showed up closer and 
broader. They widened as they 
came, like the flare of a horn, 
growing hazier as they approached, until, while the eye followed them, they seemed to fill 
the sky and lose themselves. 

From the position of the Scavenger fleet just inside the outer 
rim of the outermost ring, the 
rings broke up and assumed 
their true identity as a phenomenal cluster of solid fragments 
rather than the tight, solid band 
of light they seemed. 

Below him, or rather in, the 
direction his feet pointed, some 
twenty miles away, was one of 
the ring fragments. It looked like 
a large irregular splotch, marring 
the symmetry of space, three


quarters in brightness and the 
night shadow cutting it like a 
knife. Other fragments were 
farther off, sparkling like stardust, dimmer and thicker, until, 
as you followed them down, they 
became rings once more. 

The fragments were motionless, but that was only because 
the ships had taken up an orbit 
about Saturn equivalent to that 
of the outer edge of the rings. 

THE day before, Rioz reflected, 
he had been on that nearest 
fragment, working along with 
more than a score of others to 
mold it into the desired shape. 
Tomorrow, he would be at it 
again. 

Today — today he was spacefloating. 

"Mario?" The voice that broke 
upon his ear-phones was questioning. 

Momentarily, Rioz was flooded 
with annoyance. Damn it, he 
wasn't in the mood for company. 

"Speaking," he said. 

"I thought I had your ship 
spotted. How are you?" 

"Fine. That you, Ted?" 

"That's right," said Long. 

"Anything wrong on the fragment?" 

"Nothing. I'm out here floating." 
"You?" 

"It gets me, too, occasionally. 
Beautiful, isn't it?" * 



34 




 



"Nice," agreed Rioz. 

"You know, I've read Earth 
books — " 

"Grounder books, you mean." 
Rioz yawned and found it difficult under the circumstances to 
use the expression with the 
proper amount of resentment. 

" — and sometimes I read descriptions of people lying on 
grass," continued Long. "You 
know, that green stuff like thin 
long pieces of paper they have 
all over the ground down there, 
and they look up at the blue sky 
with clouds in it. Did you ever 
see any films of that?" 

"Sure. It didn't attract me. It 
looked cold." 

"I suppose it isn't, though. After 
all. Earth is quite close to the Sun 
and they say their atmosphere 
is thick enough to hold the heat. 
I must admit that personally I 
would hate to be caught under 
open sky with nothing on but 
clothes. Still, I imagine they 
like it." 

"Grounders are nuts!" 
^ "They talk about the trees, big 
brown stalks, and the winds, air 
movements, you know." 

"You mean drafts. They can 
keep that, too." 

"It doesn't matter. The point 
is they describe it beautifully, almost passionately. Many times 
I've wondered, 'What's it really 
like? Will I ever feel it or is this 
something only Earthmen can 



possibly feel?' I've felt so often 
that I was missing something 
vital. Now I know what it must 
be like. It's this. Complete peace 
in the middle of a beauty drenched universe." 

RIOZ said, "They wouldn't like 
it. The Grounders, I mean. 
They're so used to their own 
lousy little world, they wouldn't 
appreciate what it's like to float 
and look down on Saturn." He 
flipped his body slightly and began swaying back and forth about 
his center of mass, slowly, soothingly. 

Long said, "Yes, I think so, 
too. They're slaves to their planet. 
Even if they come to Mars, it 
will only be their children that 
are free. There'll be starships 
someday; great, huge things that 
can carry thousands of people 
and maintain its self-contained 
equilibrium for decades, maybe 
centuries. Mankind will spread 
through the whole Galaxy. But 
people will have to live their 
lives out on shipboard until new 
methods of interstellar travel are 
developed, so it will be Martians, 
not planet-bound Earthmen, who 
will colonize the Universe. That's 
inevitable. It's got to be. It's 
the Martian way." 

But Rioz made no answer. He 
had dropped off to sleep again, 
rocking and swaying gently, half 
a million miles above Saturn. 



THE MARTIAN WAY

VII 

TpHE work-shift of the ringfragment was the tail of the 
coin. The weightlessness, peace 
and privacy of the space-float 
gave place to something that had 
neither peace nor privacy. Even 
the weightlessness, which continued, became more a purgatory 
than a paradise under the new 
conditions. 

Try to manipulate an ordinarily non-portable heat projector. It 
could be lifted, despite the fact 
that it was six feet high and wide 
and almost solid metal, since it 
only weighed a fraction of an 
ounce. But its inertia was exactly 
what it had always been, which 
meant that if it wasn't moved 
into position very slowly, it would 
jutt keep on going, taking you 
with it. Then you would have to 
hike the pseudo-grav field of your 
suit and come down with a jar. 

Keralski had hiked the field a 
little too high and he came down 
a little too roughly, with the projector coming down with him at 
a dangerous angle. His crushed 
ankle had been the first casualty 
of the expedition. 

Rioz was swearing fluently and 
nearly continuously. He continued to have the impulse to 
drag the back of his hand across 
his forehead in order to wipe 
away the accumulating sweat. 
The few times that he had suc


cumbed to the impulse, metal 
had met silicone with a clash that 
rang loudly inside his suit, but 
served no useful purpose. The 
desiccators within the suit were 
sucking at maximum and, of 
course, recovering the water and 
restoring ion-exchanged liquid, 
containing a careful proportion of 
salt, into the appropriate receptacle. 

Rioz yelled, "Damn it, Dick, 
wait till I give the word, will 
you?" 

And Swenson's voice rang in 
his ears, "Well, how long am I 
supposed to sit here?" 

"Till I say," replied Rioz. 

He strengthened pseudo-grav 
and lifted the projector a bit. He 
released pseudo-grav, insuring 
that the projector would stay in 
place for minutes even if he 
withdrew support altogether. He 
kicked the cable out of the way 
(it stretched beyond the close 
"horizon" to a power source that 
was out of sight) and touched the 
release. 

The material of which the fragment was composed bubbled and 
vanished under its touch. A section of the lip of the tremendous 
cavity he had already carved into 
its substance melted away and a 
roughness in its contour had disappeared. 

"Try it now," called Rioz. 

Swenson was in the ship that 




 



was hovering nearly over Rioz's 
head. 

Swenson called, "All clear?" 
"I told you to go ahead." 

IT was a feeble flicker of steam 
that issued from one of the 
ship's forward vents. The ship 
drifted down toward the ringfragment. Another flicker adjusted a tendency to drift sidewise. 
It came down straight. 

A third flicker to the rear slowed it to a feather-rate. 

Rioz watched tensely. "Keep 
her coming. You'll make it. 
You'll make it." 

The rear of the ship entered the 
hole, nearly filling it. The bellying walls came closer and closer 
to its rim. There was a grinding 
vibration as the ship's motion 
halted. 

It was Swenson's turn to curse. 
"It doesn't fit," he said. 

Rioz threw the projector 
groundward in a passion and 
went flailing up into space. The 
projector kicked up a white crystalline dust all about it, and when 
Rioz came down under pseudograv, he did the same. 

He said, "You went in on the 
bias, you dumb Grounder." 

"I hit it level, you dirt-eating 
farmer." 

Backward-pointing side jets of 
the ship were blasting more 
strongly than before, and Rioz 
hopped to get out of the way. 



The ship scraped up from the 
pit, then shot into space half a 
mile before forward jets could 
bring it to a halt. 

Swenson said tensely, "We'll 
spring half a dozen plates if we 
do this once again. Get it right, 
will you?" 

"I'll get it right. Don't worry 
about it. Just you come in right." 

Rioz jumped upward and allowed himself to climb three hundred yards to get an overall look 
at the cavity. The gouge-marks 
of the ship were plain enough. 
They were concentrated at one 
point, halfway down the pit. He 
would get that. 

It began to melt outward under 
the blaze of the projector. 

Half an hour later, the ship 
snuggled neatly into its cavity, 
and Swenson, wearing his spacesuit, emerged to join Rioz. 

Swenson said, "If you want to 
step in and climb out of the suit, 
I'll take care of the icing." 

"It's all right," said Rioz. "I'd 
just as soon sit here and watch 
Saturn." 

He sat down at the Hp of the 
pit. There was a six-foot gap between it and the ship. In some 
places about the circle, it was two 
feet, in a few places even merely 
a matter of inches. You couldn't 
expect a better fit out of handwork. The final adjustment 
would be made by steaming ice 
gently and letting it freeze into 



THE -MARTIAN WAY 



the cavity between the lip and 
the ship. 

SATURN moved visibly across 
the sky, its vast bulk inching 
below the horizon. 

Rioz said, "How many ships 
are left to put in place?" 

Swenson said, "Last I heard, it 
was eleven. We*re in now, so that 
means only ten. Seven of the ones 
that are placed are iced in. Two 
or three are dismantled." 
"We're coming along fine." 
"There's plenty to do yet. Don't 
forget the main jets at the other 
end. And the cables and the power lines. Sometimes I wonder if 
we'll make it< On the way out, it 
didn't bother me so much, but 
just now I was sitting at the controls and I was saying: 'We won't 
make it. We'll sit out here and 
starve and die with nothing but 
Saturn over us.' It makes me 
feel—" 

He didn't explain how it made 
him feel. He just sat there. 

Rioz said, "You think too 
damn much." 

"It's different with you," said 
Swenson. "I keep thinking of 
Pete — and Dora." 

"What for? She said you could 
go, didn't she? The Commissioner gave her that talk on patriotism and how you'd be a hero and 
set for life once you got back, and 
she said you could go. You didn't 
sneak out the way Adams did." 



"Adams is different. That wife 
of his should have been shot 
when she was born. Some women 
can make hell for a guy, can't 
they? She didn't want him to go 
— But she'd probably rather he 
didn't come back if she can get 
his settlement pay " 

"Whaf s your kick, then? Dora 
wants you back, doesn't she?" 

Swenson sighed. "I never treated her right." 

"You turned over your pay, it 
seems to me. I wouldn't do that 
for any woman. Money for value 
received, not a cent more." 
" "Money isn't it. I get to thinking out here. A woman likes 
company. A kid needs his father. 
What am I doing way out here?" 

"Getting set to go home." 

"Ah-h, you don't understand." 

VIII 

rpED LONG wandered over the 
ridged surface of the ringfragment with his spirits as icy 
as the ground he walked on. It 
had all seemed perfectly logical 
back on Mars, but that was Mars. 
He had worked it out carefully 
in his mind in perfectly reasonable steps. He could still remember exactly how it went. 

It didn't take a ton of water to 
move a ton of ship. It was not 
mass equals mass, but mass times 
velocity equals mass times velocity. It didn't matter, in other 



38 




 

I 



words, whether you shot out a 
ton of water at a mile a second 
or a hundred pounds of water at 
twenty miles a second. You got 
the same final velocity out of the 
ship. 

That meant the jet nozzles had 
to be made narrower and the 
steam hotter. But then drawbacks 
appeared. The narrower the nozzle, the more energy was lost in 
friction and turbulence. The hotter the steam, the more refractory 
the nozzle had to be and the 
shorter its. life. The limit in that 
direction was quickly reached. 

Then, since a given weight pf 
water could move considerably 
more than its own weight under 
the narrow-nozzle conditions, it 
paid to be big. The bigger the 
water-storage space, the larger 
the size of the actual travel-head, 
even in proportion. So they started to make liners heavier and 
bigger. But then the larger the 
shell, the heavier the bracings, 
the more difficult the weldings, 
the more exacting the engineering 
requirements. At the moment, the 
limit in that direction had been 
reached also. 

And then he had put his finger 
on what had seemed to him to be 
the basic flaw — the original, unswervable conception that the 
fuel had to be placed inside the 
ship; that metal had to be built 
to encircle a million tons of 
water. 



Why? Water did not have to be 
water. It could be ice, and ice 
could be shaped. Holes could be 
melted into it. Travel-heads and 
jets could be fitted into it. Cables 
could hold travel-heads and jets 
stiffly together under the influence 
of magnetic field -force grips. 

Long felt the trembling of the 
ground he walked on. He was at 
the head of the fragment. A dozen ships were blasting in and out 
of sheaths carved in its substance, and the fragment shuddered under the continuing impact. 

THE ice didn't have to be quarried. It existed in proper 
chunks in the rings of Saturn. 
That's all the rings were — pieces 
of nearly pure ice, circling Saturn. So spectroscopy stated and 
so it had turned out to be. He was 
standing on one such piece now, 
over two miles long, nearly one 
mile thick. It was almost half a 
billion tons of water, all in one 
piece, and he was standing on it. 

But now he was face to face 
with the realities of life. He had 
never told the men just how 
quickly he had expected to set up 
the fragment as a ship, but in his 
heart, he had imagined it would 
be two days. It was a week now 
and he didn't.dare to estimate 
the remaining time. He no longer 
even had any confidence that the 
task was a possible one. Would 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



39 



they be able to control jets with 
enough delicacy through leads 
slung across two miles of ice, to 
manipulate out of Saturn's dragging gravity? 

Drinking water was low, 
though they could always distill 
more out of the ice. Still, the food 
stores were not in a good way, 
either. 

T¥E paused, looked up into the 
sky, eyes straining. Was the 
object growing larger? He ought 
to measure its distance. Actually, 
he lacked the spirit to add that 
trouble to the others. His mind 
slid back to greater immediacies. 

Morale, at least, was high. The 
men seemed to enjoy being out 
Saturn-way. They were the first 
humans to penetrate this far, the 
firs^ to pass the asteroids, the 
first to see Jupiter like a glowing 
pebble to the naked eye, the first 
to see Saturn — like that. 

He didn't think fifty practical, 
case-hardened, shell-snatching 
Scavengers would take time to 
feel that sort of emotion. But they 
did. And they were proud. 

Two men and a half-buried 
ship slid up the moving horizon 
as he walked. 

He called , crisply , "Hello , 
there!" 

Rioz answered, /'That you, 
Ted?" . 

"You bet. Is that Dick with 
you?" 



"S.ure. Come on, sit down. We 
were just getting ready to ice in 
and we were looking for an excuse to delay." 

"I'm not," said Swenson, 
promptly. "When will we be 
leaving, Ted?" 

"As soon as we get through. 
That's no answer, is it?" 

Swenson said, dispiritedly, "I 
suppose there isn't any other 
answer." 

Long looked up, staring at the 
irregular bright splotch in the 
sky. 

Rioz followed his glance. 
"What's the matter?" 

For a moment. Long did not 
reply. The sky was black otherwise and the ring fragments were 
an orange dust against it. Saturn 
was more than three-fourths below the horizon and the rings 
were going with it. Half a mile 
away, a ship bounded past the 
icy rim of the planetoid into the 
sky, was orange-lit by Saturnlight, and sank down again. 

The ground trembled gently. 

Rioz said, "Something bothering you about the shadow?" 

They called it that. It was the 
nearest fragment of the rings, 
quite close considering that they 
were at the outer rim of the rings, 
where the pieces spread themselves relatively thin. It was perhaps twenty miles off, a jagged 
mountain, its shape clearly visible. 



40 




 



"How does it look to you?" 
asked Long. 

Rioz shrugged. "Okay, I guess. 
I don't see anything wrong." 

"Doesn't it seem to be getting 
larger?" 

"Why should it?" 

"Well, doesn't it?" Long insisted. 

RIOZ and Swenson stared at it 
thoughtfully. 
"It does look bigger," said 
Swenson. 

"You're just putting the notion 
into our minds," Rioz argued. 
"If it were getting bigger, it 
would be coming closer." 

"What's impossible about 
that?" 

"These things are unstable orbits." 

"They were when we came 
here," said Long. "There, did you 
feel that?" 

The ground had trembled 
again. 

Long said, "We've been blasting this thing for a week now. 
First, twenty-five ships landed 
on it, which changed its momentum right there. Not much, of 
course. Then we've been melting 
parts of it away and our ships 
have been blasting in and out of 
it— all at one end, too. In a week, 
we may have changed its orbit 
just a bit. The two fragments, 
this one and the Shadow, might 
be converging." 



"It's got plenty of room to miss 
us in." Rioz watched it thoughtfully. "Besides, if we can't even 
tell for sure that it's getting bigger, how quickly can it be moving? Relative to us, I mean." 

"It doesn't have to be moving 
quickly. Its momentum is as large 
as ours, so that, however gently 
it hits, we'll be nudged completely out of our orbit, maybe in toward Saturn, where we don't want 
to go. As a matter of fact, ice has 
a very low tensile strength, so 
that both planetoids might break 
up into gravel." 

Swenson rose to his feet. 
"Damn it, if I can tell how a shell 
is moving a thousand miles away, 
I can tell what a mountain is doing twenty miles away." He turned toward the ship. 

Long didn't stop him. 

Rioz said, "There's a nervous 
guy." 

The neighboring planetoid rose 
to zenith, passed overhead, began 
sinki ng. Twenty m i nutes 1 ater , 
the horizon opposite that portion 
behind which Saturn had disappeared burst into orange flame 
as its bulk began lifting again. 

Rioz called into his radio, "Hey, 
Dick, are you dead in there?" 

"I'm checking," came the muffled response. 

"Is it moving?" asked Long. 

"Yes." 

"Toward us?" 

There was a pause. Swehson's 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



41 



voice was a sick one. "On the 
nose, Ted. Intersection of orbits 
will take place in three days." 

"You're crazy!" yelled Rioz. 

"I checked four times," said 
Swenson. 

Long thought, blankly, "What 
do we do now?" 

IX 

SOME of the men were having 
trouble with the cables. They 
had to be laid precisely; their 
geometry had to be very nearly 
perfect for the magnetic field to 
attain maximum strength. In 
space, or even in air, it wouldn't 
have mattered. The cables would 
have lined up automatically once 
the juice went on. 
% Here it was different. A gouge 
had to be ploughed along the 
planetoid's surface and into it the 
cable had to be laid. If it were 
not lined up within a few minutes of arc of the calculated direction, a torque would be applied 
to the entire planetoid, with consequent loss of energy, none of 
which could be spared. The 
gouges then had to be redriven, 
the cables shifted aSd iced into 
the new positions. 

The men plodded wearily 
through the routine. 

And then the word reached 
them — 

"All hands to the jets!" 
Scavengers could not be said 



to be the type that took kindly 
to discipline, it was a grumbling, 
growling, muttering group that 
set about disassembling the jets 
of the ships that yet remained 
intact, carrying them to the tail 
end of the planetoid, grubbing 
them into position, and stringing 
the leads along the surface. 

It was almost twenty -four 
hours before one of them looked 
into the sky and said, "Holy jeepers!" followed by something less 
printable. 

His neighbor looked and said, 
"I'll be damned!" 

Once they noticed, all did. It 
became the most astonishing fact 
in the Universe. 

"Look at the Shadow!" 

It was spreading across the sky 
like an infected wound. Men 
looked at it, found it had doubled 
its size, wondered why they 
hadn't noticed that sooner. 

Work came to a virtual halt. 
They besieged Ted Long. 

He said, "We can't leave. We 
don't have the fuel to see us back 
to Mars and we don't have the 
equipment to capture another 
planetoid. So we've got to stay. 
Now the Shadow is creeping in 
on us because our blasting has 
thrown us out of orbit. We've got 
to change that by continuing the 
blasting. Since we can't blast the 
front end any more without endangering the ship we're building, let's try another way." 



42 




 



fXiHEY went back to work on 
-"- the jets with a furious energy 
that received impetus every half 
hour when the Shadow rose again 
over the horizon, bigger and more 
menacing than before. 

Long had no assurance that it 
would work. Even if the jets 
would respond to the distant 
controls, even if the supply of 
water, which depended upon a 
storage chamber opening directly into the icy body of the planetoid, with built-in heat projectors 
steaming the propulsive fluid directly into the driving cells, 
were adequate — there was still no 
certainty that the body of the 
planetoid without a magnetic 
cable sheathing would hold together under the enormously disruptive stresses. 

"Ready!" came the signal in 
Long's receiver. 

Long called, "Ready!" and depressed the contact. 

The vibration grew about him. 
The star field in the visiplate 
trembled. 

In the rear-view there was a 
distant gleaming spume of swiftly moving ice crystals. 

"It's blowing!" was the cry. 

It kept on blowing. Long dared 
not stop. For six hours, it blew, 
hissing, bubbling, steaming into 
space; the body of the planetoid 
converted to vapor and hurled 
away. 

The Shadow came closer until 



men did nothing but stare at the 
mountain in the sky, surpassing 
Saturn itself in spectacularity. 
Its every groove and valley was 
a plain scar upon its face. But 
when it passed through the planetoid's orbit, it crossed more than 
half a mile behind its then position. 

The steam-jet ceased. 

Long bent in his seat and cov- " 
ered his eyes. He hadn't eaten in 
two days. He could eat now, 
though. Not another planetoid 
was close enough to interrupt 
them, even if it began an approach that very moment. 

Back on the planetoid's surface, Swenson said, "All the time 
I watched that damned rock coming down, I kept saying to myself, 
'This can't happen. We can't let 
it happen.' " 

"Hell," said Rioz, "we were all 
nervous. Did you see Jim Davis? 
•He was green. I was a little 
jumpy myself." 

"That's not it. It wasn't just — 
dying, you know. I was thinking 
— I know it's funny, but I can't 
help it — I was thinking that Dora 
warned me I'd get killed, and now 
if I get myself killed, she'll never 
let me hear the last of it. Isn't 
that a crummy sort of attitude at 
a time like that?" 

"Listen," said Rioz, "you wanted to get married, so you got married. Why come to me with your 
troubles?"

X 

THE flotilla, welded into a 
single unit, was returning over 
its mighty course from Saturn to 
Mars. Each day it .flashed over a 
length of space it had taken nine 
days outward. 

Ted Long had put the entire 
crew on emergency. With twentyfive ships embedded in the planetoid taken out of Saturn's rings, 
and unable to move or maneuver 
independently, the coordination 
of their power sources into unified 
blasts was a ticklish problem. The 
jarrings that took place on the 
first day of travel nearly shook 
them out from under their hair. 

That, at least, smoothed itself 
out as the velocity raced upward 
un^ er tne steady thrust from behind. They passed the onehundred - thousand - mile - an - hour 
mark late on the second day, and 
climbed steadily toward the million-mile mark and beyond. 

Long's ship, which formed the 
needle point of the frozen fleet, 
was the only one which possessed 
a five-way view of space. It was 
an uncomfortable position under 
the circumstances. Long found 
himself watching tensely, imagining somehow that the stars 
would slowly begin to slip backward, to whizz past them, under 
the influence of the multi-ship's 
tremendous rate of travel. 
They didn't, of course. They 



remained nailed to the black 
backdrop, their distance scorning 
with patient immobility any 
speed mere Man could achieve. 

The men complained bitterly 
after the first few days. It was 
not only that they were deprived 
of the space-float. They were 
burdened by much more than the 
ordinary pseudo-gravity field of 
the ships, by the effects of the 
fierce acceleration under which 
they were living. Long himself 
was weary to death of the relentless pressure against hydraulic 
cushions. 

They took to shutting off the 
jet thrusts one hour out of every 
four and Long fretted. 

It had been just over a year 
that he had last seen Mars 
shrinking in an observation window from this ship, which had 
then been an independent entity. 
What had happened since then? 
Was the colony still there? 

In something like a growing 
panic, Long sent out radio pulses 
toward Mars daily, with the 
combined power of twenty-five 
ships behind it. There was no 
answer. He expected none. Mars 
and Saturn were on opposite sides 
of the Sun now, and until he 
mounted high enough above the 
ecliptic to get the Sun well beyond the line connecting himself 
and Mars, solar interference 
would prevent any signal from 
getting through. 



44 




 



High above the outer rim of 
the Asteroid Belt, they reached 
maximum velocity. With short 
spurts of power from first one 
side jet, then another, the huge 
vessel reversed itself. The composite jet in the rear began its 
mighty roaring once again, but 
now the result was deceleration. 

They passed a hundred million 
miles over the Sun, curving down 
to intersect the orbit of Mars. 

A week out of Mars, answering 
signals were heard for the 
first time, fragmentary, ether-torn 
and incomprehensible, but they 
were coming from Mars. Earth 
and Venus were at angles sufficiently different to leave no 
doubt of that. 

Long relaxed. There were still 
humans on Mars, at any rate. 

Two days out of Mars, the signal was strong and clear and 
Sankov was at the other end. 

Sankov said, "Hello, son. It's 
three in the morning here. Seems 
like people have no consideration 
for an old man. Dragged me right 
out of bed." 

"I'm sorry, sir?" 

VDon't be. They were following orders. I'm afraid to ask, 
son. Anyone hurt? Maybe dead?" 

"No deaths, sir. Not one." 

"And — and the water? Any 
left?" 

Long said, with an effort at 
nonchalance, "Enough." 



"In that case, get home as fast 
as you can. Don't take any 
chances, of course." 

"There's trouble, then." 

"Fair- to-middling. When will 
you come down?" 

"Two days. Can you hold out 
that long?" 

"I'll hold out." 

Forty hours later, Mars had 
grown to a ruddy-orange ball that 
filled the ports and they were in 
the final planet -landing spiral. 

"Slowly," Long said to himself, "slowly." Under these conditions, even the thin atmosphere 
of Mars could do dreadful damage if they moved through it too 
quickly. 

Having come in from well 
above the ecliptic, their spiral 
passed from north to south. A 
polar cap shot whitely below 
them, then the much smaller one 
of the summer hemisphere, the 
large one again, the small one, at 
longer and longer intervals. The 
planet approached closer, the 
landscape began to show features. 

"Prepare for landing!" called 
Long. 

CANKOV did his best to look 
^ placid, which was difficult 
considering how closely the boys 
had shaved their return. But it 
had worked out well enough. 

Until a few days ago, he had no 
sure knowledge that they had 
survived. It seemed more- likely 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



— inevitable, almost — that they 
were nothing but frozen corpses 
somewhere in the trackless 
stretches from Mars to Saturn, 
new planetoids that had once 
been alive. 

The Committee had been 
dickering with him for weeks 
before the news had come. They 
had insisted on his signature to 
the paper for the sake of appearances. It would look like an 
agreement, voluntarily and mutually arrived at. But Sankov 
knew well that, given complete 
obstinacy on his part, they would 
act unilaterally and be damned 
with appearances. It seemed fairly certain that Hilder's election 
was secure now and they would 
take the chance of arousing a 
reaction of sympathy for Mars. 

So he dragged out the negotiations, dangling before them always the possibility of surrender. 

And then he heard from Long 
and concluded the deal quickly. 

The papers had lain before him 
and he had made a last statement for the benefit of the reporters who were present. 

He said, "Total imports of 
water from Earth are twenty million tons a year. This is declining 
as we develop our own piping 
system. If I sign this paper agreeing to an embargo, our industry 
will be paralyzed, any possibilities of expansion will halt. It 
looks to me as if that can't be 



what's in Earth's mind, can it?" 

Their eyes met his and held 
only a hard glitter. Assemblyman 
Digby.had already been replaced 
and they were unanimous against 
him. 

The Committee Chairman impatiently pointed out, "You have 
said alt this before." 

"I know, but right now I'm 
kind of getting ready to sign and 
I want it clear in my head. Is 
Earth set and determined to 
bring us to an end here?" 

"Of course not. Earth is interested in conserving its irreplaceable water supply, nothing 
else." 

"You have one and a half 
quintillion tons of water on 
Earth." 

The Committee Chairman said, 
"We cannot spare water." 

And Sankov had signed. 

That had been the final note 
he wanted. Earth had one and a 
half quintillion tons of water 
and could spare none of it. 

Now, a day and a half later, 
the Committee and the reporters 
waited in the spaceport dome. 
Through thick, curving windows, 
they could see the -bare and empty grounds of Mars Spaceport. 

The Committee Chairman asked, with annoyance, "How much 
longer do we have to wait? And, 
if you don't mind, what are we 
waiting for?" 

Sankov said, "Some of our 



46 




 



boys have been out in space, out 
past the asteroids." 

The Committee Chairman removed a pair of spectacles and 
cleaned them with a snowy white 
handkerchief. "And they're returning?" 

"They are." 

The Chairman shrugged, lifted 
his eyebrows in the direction of 
the reporters. 

TN the smaller room adjoining, a 
-■- knot of women and children 
clustered about another window. 
Sankov stepped back a bit to 
cast a glance toward them. He 
would much rather have been 
with them, been part of their excitement and tension. He, like 
them, had waited over a year 
now. He, like them, had thought, 
over and over again, that the men 
must be dead. 

"You see that?" said Sankov, 
pointing. 

"Hey!" cried a reporter. "It's 
a ship!" 

A confused shouting came from 
the adjoining room. 

It wasn't a ship so much as a 
bright dot obscured by a drifting white cloud. The cloud grew 
larger and began to have form. It 
was a double streak against the 
sky, the lower ends billowing out 
and upward again. As it dropped 
still closer, the bright dot at the 
upper end took on a crudely cylindrical form. 



It was rough and craggy, but 
where the sunlight hit, brilliant 
highlights bounced back. 

The cylinder dropped toward 
the ground with the ponderous 
slowness characteristic of space 
vessels. It hung suspended on 
those blasting jets and settled 
down upon the recoil of tons of 
matter hurling downward like a 
tired man dropping into his easy 
chair. 

And as it did so, a silence fell 
upon all within the dome. The 
women and children in one room, 
the politicians and reporters in 
the other remained frozen, heads 
craned incredulously upward. 

The cylinder's landing flanges, 
extending far below the two rear 
jets, touched ground and sank 
into the pebbly morass. And then 
the ship was motionless and the 
jet action ceased. 

But the silence continued in the 
Dome. It continued for a long 
time. 

Men came clambering down 
the sides of the immense vessel, 
inching down, down the two-mile 
trek to the ground, with spikes on 
their shoes and ice axes in their 
hands. They were gnats against 
the blinding surface. 

One of the reporters croaked, 
"What is it?" 

"That," said Sankov, calmly, 
"happens to be a chunk of matter 
that spent its time scooting 
around Saturn as part of its rings. 



THE MARTIAN WAY 



Our boys fitted it out with travelhead and jets and ferried it home. 
It justturns out the fragments in 
Saturn's rings are made up out of 
ice." 

TJE spoke into a continuing 
deathlike silence. "That thing 
that looks like a spaceship is just 
a mountain of hard water. If it 
were standing like that on Earth, 
it would be melting into a puddle 
and maybe it would break under 
its own weight. Mars is colder 
and has less gravity, so there's 
no such danger. 

"Of course, once we get this 
thing really organized, we can 
have water stations on the moons 
of Saturn and Jupiter and on the 
asteroids. We can scale in chunks 
of*Saturn's rings and pick them 
up and send them on at the various stations. Our Scavengers are 
good at that sort of thing. 

"We'll have all the water we 
need. That one chunk you see is 
just under a cubic mile — or about 



what Earth would send us in two 
hundred years, The boys used 
quite a bit of it coming back from 
Saturn. They made it in five 
weeks, they tell me, and used up 
about a hundred million tons. 
But, Lord, that didn't make any 
dent at all in that mountain. Are. 
you getting all this, boys?" 

He turned to the reporters. 
There was no doubt they were 
getting it. 

He said, "Then get this, too. 
Earth is worried about its water 
supply. It only has one and a 
half quintillion tons. It can't 
spare us a single ton out of it. 
Write down that we folks on 
Mars are worried about Earth 
and don't want anything to happen to Earth people. Write down 
that we'll sell water to Earth. 
Write down that we'll let them 
have million-ton lots for a reasonable fee. Write down that in 
ten years, we figure we can sell 
it in cubic-mile lots. Write down 
that Earth can quit worrying be




THE MARTIAN WAY 



cause Mars can sell it all the 
water it needs and wants." 

The Committee Chairman was 
past hearing. He was feeling the 
future rushing in. Dimly, he 
could see the reporters grinning 
as they wrote furiously. 

Grinning! 

He could hear the grin become 
laughter on Earth as Mars turned the tables so neatly on the 
anti-Wasters. He could hear the 
laughter thunder from every continent when word of the fiasco 
spread. And he could see the 
abyss, deep and black as space, 
into which would drop forever 
the political hopes of John Hilder 
and of every opponent of space 
flight left on Earth — his own included, of course. 

IN the adjoining room, Dora 
Swenson screamed with joy, 
and Peter, grown two inches, 
jumped up and down, calling, 
'Daddy! Daddy!" 

Richard Swenson had just 
stepped off the extremity of the 
flange and. face showing clearly 
through the clear silicone of the 
headpiece, marched toward the 
Dome. 

"Did you ever see a guy look 
so happy?" asked Ted Long. 
"Maybe there's something in this 
marriage business." 

"Ah, you've just been out in 
space too long," Rioz said.
